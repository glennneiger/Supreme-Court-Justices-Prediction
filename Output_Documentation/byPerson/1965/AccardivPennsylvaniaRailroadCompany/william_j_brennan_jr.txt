justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
mr.
posner
that
other
benefits
takes
a
connotation
of
insurance,
things
like
insurance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
for
example
a
furloughed
employee
you
suggest
were
entitled
vacation
pay,
were
there
some
such
arrangement
as
that
while
they
were
in
service,
they'd
get
vacation
pay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
difficulty
is
knowing
what
other
benefits,
insurance
you
suggest.
this
means
keeping
alive
their
participation
on
a
group
insurance
program.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that's
easier,
but
don't
quite
see
what
other
benefits
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
posner
let's
see
in
--
actually
what
happened
here?
accardi
did
get
some
severance
pay,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
17
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that's
not
giving
him
any
credit
for
his
time
at
service,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
that
by
credit
he
would
get
20
years
on
the
basis
of
20
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
difference
would
it
make
in
dollars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
$1200?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
butler,
does
that
definition
appear
on
the
record?
i
see
the
agreement
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
just
wondered
whether
the
--
you
could
refer
me
to
the
definition
itself
of
compensated
service.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
8
(c)
argument,
isn't
it,
mr.
butler?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
then,
mr.
butler,
if
you
had
a
vacation
pay
program
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
said,
four
weeks
vacation
pay
after
20
years
of
compensated
service,
three
with
vacation
pay
after
17
years
of
compensated
service,
and
they
have
this
provision
you
pointed
to
at
page
10,
you'd
say
the
party
got
only
three
weeks
and
not
four,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
--
suppose
here
is
any
basis
for
the
assumption
--
presumption
call
it
if
you
will
that
but-for
the
three
years
he
spent
in
service
accardi
would
have
worked
at
least
one
day
a
month?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
years
1940
to
1943?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
application
to
fellow
veterans
during
last
war,
i
take
it,
never
got
into
the
negotiation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
did
provide
for
the
furlough,
or
didn't
it,
expressly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
noticed
at
page
10,
the
furloughed
oiler
as
such
was
taken
care
of
provided
herein
at
least
$26,000
as
an
oiler
engineer
from
1958
to
1959.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
your
answer,
mr.
posner,
to
that
argument
in
this
respect
that
there's
nothing
about
the
selective
service
and
training
act
which
limits
the
authority
of
the
parties
to
make
this
claim
of
a
standard
as
the
measurement,
agree
upon
this
kind
of
a
standard
even
though
its
consequences
to
set
out
the
veterans
three
years
credit
that
otherwise
he'd
have
were
just
length
of
service.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that
the
man
--
if
an
employer
is
going
out
of
business
and
he's
going
to
make
a
separation
pay
provision,
well
then
--
and
it's
going
to
be
based
on
anything
that
is
related
to
employment
which
the
veteran
could
not
perform
because
he
was
in
the
service.
nevertheless,
he's
got
to
be
given
credit
for
that
time,
is
that
it?
