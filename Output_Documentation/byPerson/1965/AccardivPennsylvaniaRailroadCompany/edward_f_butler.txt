mr.
edward
f.
butler
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
underline
that
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
in
the
provisions
of
the
selective
service
act,
specifically
provisions
in
the
section
8
(c)
which
should
be
read
to
override
the
plain
provisions
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
freely
negotiated
and
freely
arrived
at
by
the
employer
and
the
union
representing
the
employees.
and
i
think,
to
see
this
issue
in
its
proper
setting
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
make
a
somewhat
in
large
statement
of
the
facts
gave
a
somewhat
greater
interpretation
of
the
agreement
than
has
thus
far
been
placed
before
the
court.
as
the
court
has
been
informed,
when
these
petitioners
went
in
the
military
service
back
in
1943,
there
were
no
provisions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
separation
pay.
separation
pay
was
a
thing
unheard
of
so
far
as
the
railroad
was
concerned
in
any
of
its
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
that
was
so
for
many
years
after
these
veterans
were
restored,
and
when
they
were
restored
after
their
completion
of
their
military
service,
they
were
restored
with
seniority
date
which
in
every
way
complied
with
the
provisions
of
the
selective
training
and
service
act
of
section
8
(c).
that
is
included
--
stipulated
in
the
stipulation
which
is
in
the
record
before
the
court.
now,
these
petitioners
had
no
antecedent
rights
to
separation
allowances.
we
come
now
down
to
15
years
later,
in
the
year
1959,
and
at
that
time
a
labor
dispute
arose
between
not
only
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
but
seven
other
railroads
who
operate
railroad
tugs
in
new
york
harbor.
between
them
and
the
employees
who
perform
the
duties
of
the
job
classification
known
as
oilers
on
those
tugs.
and
this
dispute
precipitated
a
strike.
it
was
a
strike
that
tied
up
the
movement
of
the
rail
freight
and
the
harbor
of
the
city
of
new
york
for
some
time.
it
eventually
resulted
in
litigation
which
finally
reached
this
court.
and
ultimately,
after
these
many
months
of
turmoil,
the
parties
got
together
and
they
solved
their
differences.
this
agreement
that
they
made
was
a
two-pronged
agreement.
first,
it
provided
that
all
employees
in
the
oilers
classification
who
had
seniority
of
20
years
or
more
could
stay
on
the
job.
and
in
computing
seniority,
full
credit
was
given
to
the
time
of
the
veterans
in
military
service.
when
it
came
to
measuring
the
quantum
of
the
separation
allowance,
here
the
parties
bargained
for
a
separation
allowance
based
on
a
measuring
run
of
length
of
compensated
service
and
this
length
of
compensated
service
by
its
definition
excluded
the
period
of
time
that
these
petitioners
spent
in
military
service.
and
also,
another
very
vital
point,
excluded
the
time
of
any
other
employees
who
were
on
furlough
during
the
course
of
their
employment
for
any
other
nonmilitary
reason
and
there
were
many
of
those.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
do
not
mean
there
was
an
explicit
exclusion,
sir.
i
mean
that
the
definition
of
the
term
length
of
compensated
service
and
the
mechanics
which
the
agreement
called
forth
to
spell
it
out
made
it
perfectly
evident
that
people
who
had
not
been
on
the
job
and
earning
pay
were
not
qualified
for
the
period
of
time
that
that
was
so.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
the
agreement
is
in
the
record
in
full
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
specific
definition
of
compensated
service
as
such.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
except
that
in
the
note
on
page
10
underneath
the
column
or
tabulation,
the
agreement
states,
a
month
of
compensated
service
is
any
month
and
which
the
employee
worked
one
or
more
days.
so
in
that
sense,
there
is
an
explicit
definition
that
in
order
to
qualify
under
the
term
'compensated
service'
you
have
to
work
on
the
job.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
think
that
is
the
government's
position
mr.
justice
white
and
we
think
it's
an
entirely
unjustified
position
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
section
8
(c)
or
the
selective
service
act
that
requires
this.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
sir?
mr.
edward
f.
butler
no.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
don't
think
tilton
controls
it,
because
tilton
involved
the
question
of
seniority
and
what
privileges
were
to
pertain
to
seniority.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
this
court
held
that
it
had
to
be
dated
back.
but
that
case,
as
i
say,
involved
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
by
no
means.
by
no
means
and
i
think
that
the
mckinney
case
by
pointing
out
that
where
job
benefits
are
not
automatically
tied
to
seniority,
then
a
veteran
does
not
become
entitle
to
them
under
the
previsions
of
section
8
(c)
is
also
of
considerable
relevance
to
this
case.
but
more
than
any
other
previous
precedent
in
this
court
which
is,
we
respectfully
submit
important,
are
the
precedents
of
the
aeronautical
lodge
against
campbell
and
trailmobile
against
whirls.
because
those
were
cases
decided
a
number
of
years
ago
in
which
this
court
held
that
under
situations
where
veterans
had
already
vested
rates
after
being
restored
to
employment,
that
those
rights
could
be
divested
by
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
was
fairly
arrived
at
without
any
taint
of
hostility
toward
veterans.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
no
such
taint
can
be
levied
at
the
agreement
here.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
that
is
right
sir,
and
that
is
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
that
is
right,
sir.
so
that
--
both
veterans
and
nonveterans
were
treated
equally
so
far
as
time
off
the
job
was
concerned.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
well,
this
is
--
my
argument
is
that
8
(c)
doesn't
control
this
case.
section
8
(c)
simply
requires
that
a
veteran
be
restored
without
loss
of
seniority.
now,
what
benefits
are
to
be
perquisites
of
seniority
is
left
entirely
by
8
(c)
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
parties.
section
8
(c)
doesn't
undertake
to
impose
a
seniority
system.
section
8
(c)
assumes
and
accepts
the
seniority
systems
that
have
been
negotiated
by
the
parties
and
are
in
effect
in
any
employment
situation
to
which
section
8
(c)
is
applied.
now
here,
the
plain
fact
is
that
the
employer
and
the
union
negotiated
a
settlement
of
this
strike
by
awarding
separation
allowances
based
not
on
seniority.
and
it
was
perfectly
confident
for
them,
we
respectfully
submit,
to
make
that
choice.
section
8
(c)
does
not
mandate
that
in
computing
separation
allowance
or
anything
else
that
seniority
must
necessarily
be
the
measuring
rod.
indeed,
this
court
in
the
ford
motor
company
against
huffman
case
pointed
out
the
wide
range
of
discretion
that
must
be
given
the
employer
and
the
collective
bargaining
agent
to
work
out
arrangements
which
are
fair
to
the
entire
bargaining
unit
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
duty
was
fully
met
and
fully
discharged
here.
it
would
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
would,
yes.
i
would,
and
the
agreement
that
we
have
here,
the
agreement
that
these
parties
worked
out
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
it
would
work
out
really
under
most
difficult
conditions
and
ford's
dried
out
of
the
better
heat
of
industrial
conflict.
the
agreement
that
these
parties
hammered
out,
was
an
agreement
which
has
--
is
not
unusual
in
many
of
its
features.
the
department
of
labor
has
recently
published
a
very
comprehensive
follow-up
in
this
area,
entitled
severance
pay
and
lay-off
benefit
plans.
it
reviews
the
various
types
of
separation
pay
and
lay-off
benefit
plans
that
are
found
throughout
the
country.
and
it's
immediately
apparent
that
a
wide
variety
of
measuring
rods
has
been
used,
seniority
has
been
used.
perhaps
the
most
common
measuring
rod
which
has
been
used
for
separation
pay
is
a
--
the
employee's
total
earnings
during
the
cause
of
his
employment.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
think
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
think
the
court
can
well
assume
that
he
would
have,
but
i
don't
think
that's
dispositive
of
this
case.
because
what
he
is
entitled
to
so
long
as
the
agreement
that
has
been
made
on
his
behalf
by
the
union
with
the
employer
was
concerned
is
not
hostile
to
veterans
and
doesn't
discriminate
against
them
so
long
is
that
so,
then
i
think
we
have
to
abide
by
the
agreement.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
then
we
would've
computed
seniority
by
giving
him
credit
for
the
military
service.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
he
would
have
because
the
agreement
would
have
given
it
to
him.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
don't
think
the
one
day
a
month
affects
it
one
way
the
other,
mr.
justice
white.
this
was
a
compromise
reached
after
hard
bargaining
between
the
parties.
presumably,
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
no,
i
do
not,
because
that
would
be
discriminating
against
veterans.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
will
modify
that
by
saying,
it's
dispositive
of
the
case
if
the
agreement
is
without
taint
of
hostility
toward
veterans,
if
it
doesn't
discriminate
against
veterans.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
no,
i
do
not.
no.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
don't
it's
--
well,
i
think
it
is
significantly
different
because
it's
still
compensated
service.
it's
a
way
of
measuring
length
of
compensated
service.
and
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
--
i
would
like
to
make
this
point
that
here,
of
course,
at
the
time
this
settlement
was
made,
the
railroads
involved
were
able
to
estimate,
at
least
they
thought
they
were
able
to
estimate
the
total
cost
of
this
package.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
never
got
into
the
negotiations.
and
the
record
--
the
stipulation
in
the
record
affirmatively
shows
or
stipulates
that
this
agreement
was
made
in
good
faith
and
there
was
an
affidavit
before
the
court,
which
was
not
contradicted.
an
affidavit
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
railroad
which
stated
by
a
person
who
was
involved
in
the
negotiations
that
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
anybody
to
discriminate
against
veterans.
now,
let
me
point
out
what
might
have
happened
if
the
parties
had
attempted
to
accommodate
this
point.
our
basic
position
is
that
they
were
not
required
by
section
8
(c)
to
accommodate
it.
but
let's
suppose
that
it
had
been
raised
and
they
have
attempted
to
accommodate.
i
think
the
only
thing
that
can
realistically
be
hypothesized
here
is
that
they
would
have
tried
to
rearrange
the
formula
to
still
fit
within
the
total
cost
of
the
package.
and
they
probably
would
have
then,
if
they
gave
the
veterans
credit
for
their
time
in
military
service,
would
have
given
the
other
furloughed
employees
credit
for
their
time
while
they
were
laid-off
or
on
leave
of
absence.
and
in
the
end,
these
veterans
might
have
gotten
a
less
individual
benefit
than
they've
already
received,
because
this
would
necessarily
have
deluded
the
benefit
that
went
to
each
individual.
now,
i
think
that
it's
a
matter
of
fact
the
agreement
itself
--
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
butler
i
think
there
is
another
significant
provision
that
is
directly
relevant
to
the
point
that
i
was
just
making,
your
honor,
contained
on
page
12
of
this
agreement.
you
will
note
down
there
under
paragraph
9.
the
parties
addressed
themselves
to
the
question
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
company
which
at
that
time
didn't
have
any
diesel
tugs.
they
had
steam
tugs
but
they
were
planning
a
diesel
operation
and
they
were
looking
forward
when
they
planned
the
diesel
operation
to
laying-off
these
oilers.
and
the
agreements
specifically
says
as
dieselization
proceeds
the
parties
will
endeavor
to
accommodate
the
principles
adopted
herein
to
the
success
of
steps
of
dieselization.
the
carrier
shall
not
be
required
to
provide
any
benefits
more
extensive
or
relatively
more
expensive
than
those
provided
herein.
obviously,
what
the
railroads
were
interested
in
was
in
achieving
their
objective
within
their
own
financial
limitations.
presumably,
each
one
had
put
a
limit
on
the
amount
to
the
package,
the
amount
he
was
willing
to
pay
to
achieve
this
objective.
and
if
substantial
additional
cost
is
now
to
be
imposed
upon
them,
we
think
that
certainly
it's
not
required
by
section
8
(c)
and
would
be
obviously
inequitable.
now,
i
would
like
to
close
by
saying
a
word
about
the
last
clause
of
section
8
(c)
which
--
section
8
(c)
contains
four
different
provisions
with
respect
to
veterans.
it
says,
first,
that
after
they're
restored,
they
shall
be
considered
as
having
been
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence.
now,
that's
just
exactly
the
way
we
treated
them
as
though
they've
been
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence.
so
we
have
certainly
complied
with
that
part
of
section
8
(c).
but
the
last
clause
is
the
one
to
which
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention.
and
that
is
the
clause
which
provides
that
he
after
being
restored
and
given
these
rights,
he
shall
not
be
discharged
from
such
position
without
cause
within
one
year
after
such
restoration.
now,
this
court
has
held
in
the
oakley
case
that
that
one
year
period
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations.
nevertheless,
in
whirl
mobiles,
this
court
held
that
that
did
apply
not
only
to
discharges
but
to
the
cutting
back
of
any
other
kind
of
employment
benefits
which
a
veteran
had.
so
that
while
in
the
oakley
case,
it
was
held
to
be
not
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
stands
here
in
the
statute
as
testimony
of
congress'
intent
that
these
benefits
not
be
frozen
into
the
employment
relationship
per
omnia
saecula
saeculorum.
and
here,
we
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
into
15
years
after
these
people
completed
their
period
of
military
service
and
we
thing
that
the
agreement
was
nondiscriminatory
at
its
terms
excluded
there
time
in
military
service
and
if
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
