mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
by
six
veterans
of
world
war
ii
against
their
former
employer,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
to
enforce
claims
based
on
the
section
8,
the
selective
training
and
service
act
of
1940.
the
act
provides
for
the
representation
of
such
claimants
by
the
department
of
justice.
petitioners
prevailed
in
the
district
court.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
cases
here
on
certiorari.
the
facts
were
stipulated
and
may
be
briefly
summarized.
petitioners
were
hired
in
1941
and
1942
as
firemen
on
tugboats
operated
by
the
railroad
in
new
york
harbor.
shortly
after
being
hired,
they
left
to
enter
military
service
in
world
war
ii
and
after
serving
for
about
three
years,
were
honorably
discharged.
the
railroad
as
required
in
section
8
(b)
of
the
act,
restored
petitioners
to
their
old
jobs
as
firemen.
in
1959,
the
job
of
firemen
or
as
sometimes
called
oilier
on
all
for
the
railroads
diesel
tugboats
in
new
york
harbor
was
abolished
on
the
ground
that
diesel
tugboats
don't
need
a
fireman.
and
this
action
of
the
railroad
precipitated
a
major
strike.
the
strike
was
settled
by
an
agreement
between
the
railroad
and
the
union
representing
its
employees
which
provided
among
other
things
for
separation
allowances.
that
is
severance
pay
to
be
given
those
employees
like
petitioners
whose
jobs
were
abolished.
now,
the
amount
of
these
separation
allowances
was
measured
by
the
number
of
months
of
the
employees
compensated
service
for
the
railroad.
compensated
service,
being
a
term
defined
in
this
fashion,
a
month
of
compensated
service
was
any
month
in
which
the
employee
had
worked
at
least
one
day
for
the
railroad.
and
a
year
of
compensated
service
was
12
such
months
or
a
major
portion
thereof,
seven
months.
these
petitioners,
these
veterans,
of
course,
had
not
been
able
to
work
one
day
of
month
during
their
three
years
in
military
service
in
world
war
ii.
and
the
railroad
decided
that
their
period
of
military
service
should
not
be
counted
as
compensated
service
for
purpose
of
computing
the
amount
of
the
separation
allowances
to
which
they
were
entitled.
and
the
result
was
that
each
of
these
petitioners
received
some
$1200
less
in
separation
allowances
than
he
would
have
received
had
his
military
service
been
counted
or
in
other
words
had
his
civilian
employment
with
the
railroad
never
been
interrupted
by
military
service.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
employees
â€“-
mr.
richard
a.
posner
employees
who
had
20
years
seniority,
seniority
being
measured
from
first
being
hired
by
the
railroad
were
given
an
election.
petitioner
accardi
was
the
only
one
of
the
six
veterans
who
qualified
who
have
the
20
years.
he
is
the
only
one
could
elect
and
he
elected
instead
to
take
these
--
to
take
his
separation
allowance.
now,
section
8
(c)
of
the
selective
training
and
service
act
requires
that
any
veteran
who
is
restored
to
his
former
civilian
employment,
as
section
8
(b)
requires
and
as
was
done
here,
shall
be
restored
without
loss
of
seniority.
and
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
these
petitioners
were
denied
seniority
in
being
refused
separation
allowances
in
an
amount
equal
to
what
they
would
have
received
had
their
military
service,
had
their
civilian
employment
not
been
interrupted.
this
issue
in
turn
ends
on
how
two
questions
were
answered.
the
first
is
whether
the
measure
of
the
separation
allowances,
what
the
contract
between
the
union
and
the
railroad
calls
length
of
compensated
service
was
seniority
in
the
statuary
sense.
and
the
second
question
is,
if
so,
are
these
allowances
accorded
on
the
basis
of
seniority
the
kind
of
benefits
which
the
act
means
to
protect
for
the
veteran?
and
the
first
of
these
questions
requires
us
to
examine
the
concept
of
seniority
as
it's
used
in
the
act.
and
i
think
we
can
usefully
approach
this
by
asking
why
congress
should
have
selected
seniority
as
a
standard
of
the
veterans'
reemployment
rights.
it's
clear
i
think
what
the
basic
impulse
behind
these
veterans
legislation
is.
it's
the
feeling
that
veterans
should
not
be
penalized
in
their
civilian
employment
careers,
by
reason
of
having
been
called
into
the
armed
services
in
an
hour
of
the
country's
great
need.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
thought,
this
desire
for
equality
were
carried
to
its
logical
extreme,
the
results
would
be
rather
disruptive
and
impractical.
because
if
one
really
wants
to
fully
equalize
the
employments
status
of
a
veteran
and
of
a
nonveteran,
that
would
mean,
for
example,
compiling
the
employer
to
make
up
the
difference
in
pay
scales
between
the
armed
forces
and
the
civilian
employment.
or
it
might
require
compelling
an
employer
to
attribute
to
a
veteran
a
skill
or
qualification
that
he
might
have
received
had
he
not
been
inducted
into
the
armed
forces
but
that
he
didn't
receive.
in
other
words,
there
are
difficult
questions
in
social
policy
involved
in
--
if
one
is
to
go
so
far
as
to
require
an
employer
to
pay
a
veteran
for
work
he
didn't
do
or
for
a
skill
he
didn't
attain,
although
he
would
have.
on
the
other
hand,
as
congress
well
knew,
at
least
in
those
industries
where
collective
bargaining
with
independent
unions
is
the
prevailing
mode
of
regulating
industrial
relations,
many
of
the
perquisites
of
employment,
promotions
of
various
sorts,
wage
increases,
vacation
rights,
retirement
rights,
order
of
lay-off
and
recall,
are
made
to
flow
automatically
from
the
length
of
the
employee's
service
with
the
employer.
and
these
benefits
or
perquisites
are
not
intended
to
compensate
an
employee
for
the
work
he's
done
or
as
an
incentive
better
work
in
the
future.
and
if
you
require
just
these
benefits,
benefits
which
are
accorded
mechanically,
automatically
on
a
basis
of
time
served
to
a
veteran
as
if
he
had
never
been
inducted,
you
don't
have
any
of
these
disruptive
effects
on
the
employer's
managerial
discretion.
and
we
submit
that
in
making
seniority
the
statutory
test
to
these
veterans'
employment
rights,
congress
meant
to
protect
for
the
veteran
this
entire
range
of
benefits
which
are
conferred
on
the
basis
of
how
long
you've
been
on
the
job.
and
don't
have
any
implication
of
the
reward
for
the
value
the
employee's
contribution
or
for
the
skill
of
his
work.
and
if
this
is
the
proper
test,
then
clearly,
the
veterans
in
this
case
were
improperly
denied
separate
--
the
full
separation
allowances
to
which
they
were
entitled
because
the
measure
used
in
this
agreement
defined
the
amount
of
separation
allowances.
what
the
parties
called
length
of
compensated
service
was
in
all
practical
respects
a
measure
based
on
time
of
the
employee
in
the
railroads
employ
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
attempting
to
compensate
employees
for
their
particular
contributions
to
the
railroad's
business
or
for
the
skills
they
had
attained
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
there
is
no
requirement
that
--
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
that
the
employer
pay
any
amount
in
lieu
of
wages
for
the
period
when
the
veteran
was
in
the
service.
he
didn't
work
for
the
employer
he
is
not
entitled
to
any
wages.
now,
these
separation
allowances
are
not
a
--
they're
not
an
end
of
employment
bonus
or
additional
wage
compensation,
they're
a
method
of
a
tiding
over
the
employee
in
readjusting
to
another
job
to
his
lost
of
this
job.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
are
to
compensate
for
lost
future
wages.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
they
are
in
essence
an
exchange
for
giving
up
your
job
rights
for
what
you're
going
to
do
in
the
future.
and
they
were
provided
here
on
a
basis
simply,
in
all
practical
sense,
simply
on
how
long
you
happen
to
have
been
around
the
job.
an
employee
who
started
work
the
same
day
as
these
veterans
in
1941
or
1942
and
who
worked,
he
may
have
worked
very
sporadically
over
20
years
but
nevertheless
managed
to
put
in
at
least
one
day
a
month,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
far
larger
separation
allowance
than
a
veteran
who
worked
steadily.
all
of
the
17
years
he
was
on
the
job
but
of
course
during
the
three
years
of
his
military
service
couldn't
render
this
nominal
service
of
one
day
a
month.
and
this
kind
of
inequity,
this
arbitrary,
a
distinction
and
treatment
between
veterans
and
nonveterans,
we
think,
is
just
the
kind
of
inequity
that
the
statute
was
meant
to
prevent.
because
from
the
employer
standpoint,
he
can
treat
the
veteran
and
the
nonveteran
alike
in
terms
of
these
separation
allowances
without
being
involved
in
problems
of
paying
compensation
for
work
that
that
wasn't
done.
i
might
say
that
on
this
first
point,
the
court
below
was
in
agreement
with
the
government's
position,
although
the
respondent
has
taken
vigorous
issue
with
it.
the
court
agreed
that
these
separation
allowances
were
measured
by
seniority
by
length
of
service
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
term.
what
troubled
the
court
was,
some
additional
language
in
section
8
(c)
which
in
the
court's
view
carve
out
a
set
of
benefits
as
to
which
the
veteran
and
doesn't
have
the
right
to
be
treated
the
same
as
his
co-workers
who
were
not
inducted.
this
language
which
is
set
out
on
page
3
our
brief
is
the
first
and
third
clauses
of
8
(c),
where
it
says
that
any
person
who
is
restored
to
a
position
as
required
by
the
act
shall
be
considered
as
having
been
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence
during
his
period
of
training
and
service
and
shall
be
entitled
to
participate
in
insurance
or
other
benefits
offered
by
the
employer
pursuant
to
the
established
rules
and
practices
relating
to
employees
on
furlough
or
leave
of
absence
in
effect
with
the
employer
at
the
time
such
a
person
was
inducted
into
the
armed
forces.
now,
what
the
court
below
felt
was
that
there
is
a
--
there
is
this
category
of
insurance
or
other
benefits
which
the
court
felt
included
these
separation
allowances
as
to
which
you
treat
the
restored
veteran,
as
if
he
had
been
on
a
leave
of
absence
rather
than
as
if
he
had
been
working
during
his
period
in
service.
now,
we
read
this
language
in
8
(c),
these
leave
of
absence
benefits
created
in
the
statute,
rather
differently.
this
language
on
which
the
court
relied
was
added,
as
we
explain
more
fully
in
our
brief,
as
an
amendment
to
the
basic
bill
which
had
created
these
veteran
reemployment
rights
based
on
seniority.
and
the
purpose
of
this
additional
language
was
not
to
curtail
or
qualify
those
rights,
carve
out
an
exception
for
some
seniority
rights,
but
to
create
additional
rights,
and
specifically
as
the
legislative
history
indicates,
the
intent
was
to
protect
the
continued
participation
by
inducted
employees
in
group
insurance
plans
which
employers
set
up
with
their
employees.
now,
under
these
group
insurance
plans,
the
plan
would
continue
in
effect,
continue
to
protect
an
employee
even
if
happen
to
be
laid
off
or
take
a
leave
of
absence.
and
what
congress
desired
was
that
when
a
man
was
called
into
the
armed
forces
he
should
be
treated
no
worse
in
terms
to
these
insurance
programs
than
his
co-workers
who
might
be
on
leave
of
absence.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
congress
had
in
mind,
group
insurance
plans.
i
think
the
language
is
broad
enough
to
embrace
any
benefit
which
employers
extend
to
their
furloughed
employees.
it
seems
to
me,
if
--
another
example
doesn't
come
to
mind
but
whatever
benefits
at
the
time
these
people
were
called
into
the
service,
the
railroad
had
in
effect
four
furloughed
employees,
would
continue
to
accrue
in
favor
of
these
inducted
men.
they
wouldn't
lose
the
benefit
of
this
merely
by
being
inducted,
and
if
--
so
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
benefits
of
the
pre-restoration
stage
in
the
employee's
career.
while
he's
in
the
service,
he's
entitled
to
these
8
(c)
leave
of
absence
benefits.
when
he's
restored
to
his
civilian
employment,
he
then
becomes
entitled
to
all
benefits
perquisites
of
seniority
which
may
accrue.
here,
these
separation
allowances
were
first
created
in
1960
long
after
these
veterans
returned
from
the
service
and
were
available
to
employees
in
the
service
of
the
company.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
can't
imagine
that
--
i
suppose
it's
possible,
it
seems
to
me,
very
unlikely
that
employers
would
provide
vacation
pay
for
workers
who
were
laid
off
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
he
would,
again
the
example
--
it
strikes
me
as
unlikely
that
the
employer
would
make
this
kind
of
provision
for
employees
who
weren't
actually
rendering
service.
but
if
the
employer
decides
that
furloughed
employees
are
entitled
to
a
continuing
share
in
the
profits,
it
seems
entirely
fair
and
inconsonance
with
the
benevolent
purposes
of
this
legislation
that
a
person
involuntarily
furlough
because
he
was
called
into
armed
forces
should
be
entitled
to
the
same
profit
sharing
or
other
benefits
as
a
man,
an
employee,
who
likewise
is
not
actually
rendering
service
because
he's
on
furlough.
and
even
if
there
is
some
plausibility
to
the
instruction
placed
on
this
insurance
or
other
benefits
clause
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
us
--
the
result,
it
seems
to
us,
anomalous
and
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
objectives
of
this
legislation.
if
what
was
at
stake
here
was
not
severance
pay
at
all
but
a
one
set
now
or
wage
increase,
there's
no
question
but
that
veterans
assuming
the
wage
increase
was
key
to
seniority,
veterans
would
be
entitled
to
be
treated
as
if
they'd
never
been
inducted.
what
is
in
fact
at
stake
here
is
something
far
greater
than
a
once
in
an
hour
wage
increase.
these
separation
allowances,
in
some
cases,
are
the
equivalent
of
a
full
year's
wages.
and
not
only
are
they
substantial
in
character,
but
realistically
what
these
wages
are,
are
a
quid
pro
quo
for
the
surrender
of
seniority
rights
and
benefits.
the
clearest
case
is
petitioner
accardi's.
because
of
his
20
years
seniority
he
had
a
right,
a
right
based
on
seniority
to
continue
in
the
employ
of
the
railroads.
and
he
surrendered
this
right
to
seniority
in
exchange
for
this
lump
sum
payment.
and
if
the
seniority
--
the
20
years
seniority
which
he
gave
up
was
a
right
protected
by
the
act,
so
also
we
think
should
be
the
lump
sum
which
took
the
place
of
that
seniority
right.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
he
got
17
years.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
worth
of
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
$1200.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
and
on
the
basis
of
20
years
of
compensated
service,
the
employee
was
entitled
to
50
weeks
pay
which
is
almost
to
full
year's
wages.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
i
don't
think
that
would
change
the
case
at
all
although
our
case
underlines
the
arbitrariness
of
the
result
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
if
the
separation
pay
is
designed
not
to
reward
an
employee
for
particular
services
or
contribution
to
the
company,
but
it
is
designed
to
follow
automatically
from
length
of
service,
then
he
must
treat
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
that
is
the
tilton
case
which
this
court
decided
unanimously
in
the
veteran's
favor
just
two
terms
ago.
the
facts
there
were
that
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
promotion
from
apprenticeship
to
journeyman
status
that
you
had
to
spend
1000
days
as
an
apprentice
and
you
actually
had
to
be
on
the
job
as
an
apprentice
for
those
thousand
days.
the
veteran
had
served
several
hundred
of
these
days
before
world
war
ii
and
had
been
called
into
service
and
had
returned
and
finished
the
balance
of
the
thousand
days.
and
the
court
said,
that
his
seniority
as
a
journeyman
in
his
new
position
had
to
be
backdated
so
that
--
so
as
to
treat
him
just
as
if
he
had
completed
this
apprenticeship
during
his
military
service,
and
although
actual
service
on
the
job
was
the
requirement
for
the
promotion,
the
veteran
had
to
be
treated
as
if
he
had
rendered
such
service
during
the
period
of
military
service.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers.
the
first
is
that
in
the
fishgold
case,
the
leading
case
in
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
this
area.
the
court
stated
explicitly
that
the
parties
in
their
contract
could
not
cut
down
the
rights
of
veterans.
but
i
think
beyond
that,
this
case
illustrates
how
if
you
permit
the
parties
to
have
carte
blanche
in
dealing
with
these
rights
of
seniority
the
results
are
anomalous
because
mr.
butler
concedes
that
if
pure
length
of
service
were
the
criteria
these
veterans
would
be
entitled
to
equal
treatment
with
nonveterans.
the
contract
between
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
if
the
--
and
test
of
earnings
might
or
might
not
be
this.
if
the
period
the
separation
allowance
was
as
a
kind
of
bonus
for
past
work
as
revealed
by
earnings.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
case,
but
i
think
if
the
basic
point,
and
again,
it
would
--
something
would
have
to
known
in
that
case
about
the
circumstances
of
the
provision.
but
if
the
intension
is
to
make
given
a
benefit
based
on
length
of
service,
however
that's
measured,
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
with
the
qualification
that
if
the
nature
of
the
benefit
is
one
designed
as
actual
compensation
wages.
the
veteran
is
not
entitled
to
wages
for
time
that
he
was
in
the
service.
but
whereas
here
you
have
a
separation
allowance
based
on
nominal
service.
the
basic
standard
being
length
of
employment
and
the
intension
merely
to
grant
an
automatic
benefit
to
those
who
have
been
on
the
job
for
a
long
time,
veterans
are
entitled
to
be
treated
as
if
they
have
been
employed.
