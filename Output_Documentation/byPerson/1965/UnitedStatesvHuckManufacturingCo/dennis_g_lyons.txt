mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
get
it
a
little
into
the
facts
of
the
case
as
presented
by
the
record
and
review
the
time
sequence
of
the
government's
waiver
of
any
intent
to
question
the
general
electric
rule
in
this
case
because
that
time
sequence
is
a
very
important
matter.
i
will
also
discuss
why
it
is
inappropriate
from
the
procedural
stand
point
for
the
court
to
reconsider
general
electric
on
the
present
record
and
i
also
plan
to
point
out
some
of
the
serious
economic
questions
which
would
have
to
be
resolved
if
general
electric
is
to
be
overruled
and
as
to
which
proof
could
be
made
one
way
or
the
other
and
on
which
there
is
simply
no
record
to
proof
whatsoever.
mr.
pomeroy
will
address
himself
to
the
government's
suggestion
that
there
are
certain
pressing
practical
needs
that
require
the
overruling
or
the
reconsideration
of
the
general
electric
case
at
this
juncture
and
he
may
also
briefly
reply
to
the
argument
which
counsel
made
at
the
very
end,
if
it
is
oral
argument
to
the
effect
that
even
if
general
electric
is
not
overrule,
there
is
something
in
this
record
that
goes
beyond
the
general
electric
rule.
in
this
case,
there
were
a
simultaneous
indictment
and
a
civil
complaint
brought
against
huck,
the
owner
of
the
lockable
patents
and
townsend,
its
licensee.
the
criminal
case
was
also
brought
against
the
presidents
of
the
two
companies.
before
either
case
was
tried
there
were
pretrial
conferences
in
the
civil
case
in
october
of
1962.
there
was
pretrial
conference
in
the
civil
case
on
the
first
of
october
and
there
the
judge
indicated
some
concern
as
to
just
what
the
issues
were
before
him.
specifically
and
of
course
the
defendants
were
very
interested
in
these
too,
the
question
was
whether
the
government
was
seeking
to
have
the
general
electric
case
overruled.
counsel
for
the
government
said
that
they
were
not
in
a
position
of
that
conference
to
say
“yes
or
nay”
to
that
question
that
they
would
have
to
confer
presumably
of
their
superiors
in
anti-trust
division
in
washington.
there
was
a
resumed
pretrial
conference
in
the
civil
case,
a
brief
one,
on
october
15
two
weeks
lately,
when
the
governments
attorneys
reported
back
as
to
what
the
position
was
as
to
the
overruling
of
general
electric
and
as
to
what
their
position
would
be
on
that
matter.
the
first
pretrial,
the
pretrial
irrelevant
to
the
first
conference
says,
“after
a
restudy
of
the
facts,
the
government
will
advice
defendants
of
its
position.”
this
is
on
page
767
and
768,
“as
to
applicability
of
the
general
electric
case
decision
if
any
to
this
case.”
and
now
the
report
of
what
happened
on
october
15th.
on
october
15,
reporting
on
the
applicability
of
the
general
electric
case,
the
government
stated
that
it
is
attempting
to
have
the
doctrine
set
in
the
general
electric
case
overruled
and
stated
only
the
facts
in
this
case
do
not
fall
within
that
doctrine.
that
the
doctrine
is
still
good
law
but
does
not
apply
as
the
actions
in
this
case
are
illegal
without
application
of
the
doctrine.
and
that
it
will
write
a
letter
by
december
29
describing
in
what
way
of
the
facts
of
this
case
differ
from
the
facts
of
the
general
electric
case.
the
government
did
write
such
a
letter
and
that
letter
appears
on
page
779
of
the
record,
it's
a
letter
signed
by
--
on
behalf
of
the
11
jurors
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
in
anti-trust
division
and
the
letter
itself
well,
not
contain
a
statement
quite
as
strong
as
that
that
the
pretrial
order
recites
still
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
all
the
government
is
charging
is
that
the
acts
of
the
defendants
went
beyond
the
sanction
by
the
general
electric
case.
certain
another
statements
in
the
record
reinforce
this.
in
the
government's
trial
brief,
the
summary
of
the
government's
contentions
were
simply
in
terms
of
contentions
that
were
made
to
effect
that
the
conduct
that
was
charge
here
went
beyond
that
permissible
under
the
general
electric
case.
and
in
the
colloquy
of
government
counsel
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
appearing
it
698
of
the
record
the
remarks
are
all
to
the
same
effect.
at
this
point
after
the
october
pretrial
conferences,
the
criminal
trial
took
place.
the
criminal
trial
took
place
before
judge
and
the
jury
took
place
on
february
and
march
of
1963.
the
government
did
not
challenge
the
general
electric
case
in
the
criminal
case.
in
fact,
i
think
the
very
fact
that
they
brought
the
criminal
case
on
first
indicates
that
overruling
general
electric
was
not
any
part
of
their
designs
in
this
case
as
it
was
tried
in
the
district
court
and
that
it
was
completely
remote
from
anyone's
thinking.
very
difficult
to
say
that
you
could
challenge
conduct
which
was
within
the
scope
of
an
existing
supreme
court
decision
and
in
both
criminal
pains
and
penalties
down
upon
the
parties
for
following
it
and
this
of
course
was
a
prosecution
against
individuals,
as
well
as
against
the
corporations.
the
basic
transcript
of
record
that
we
have
before
us
is
the
transcript
that
was
developed
in
the
criminal
case,
we
shall
come
in
a
moment
to
why
that
is
so
here.
and
of
course
in
the
criminal
case,
there
was
no
challenge
whatsoever
made
to
the
general
electric
case.
the
government
put
evidence
in
the
criminal
case,
the
basic
patent
license
that
was
involved
here.
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
hear
counsel
say
that
the
parties
here
denied
that
there
was
any
price
fixing
and
that
price
fixing
considerations
motivated
them
and
the
original
licensing.
actually,
there
is
a
price
fixing
clause
in
the
patent
license.
the
patent
license
starts
on
the
469
of
the
record
and
there
is
a
two
year
price
fixing
clause
provided
in
paragraph
12
of
the
patent
license.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
there
--
there
is
also
a
two-year
exclusivity
period
which
is
provided
for
the
same
length
of
time.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
section
12
(a),
12
(b)
is
the
price
restrictive
--
12
(a)
is
the
exclusivity.
those
two
provisions
expired
by
their
terms
in
september
of
1956
and
we
do
not
understand
the
government
be
contending
here
that
a
price
restriction
which
expired
back
that
which
is
over
nine
years
ago
could
now
be
the
basis
of
an
injunction.
their
cases
as
i
understand
it
that
there
was
a
continuing
price
restriction
here
beyond
the
two-year
period
and
that
that
if
general
electric
is
overruled
could
be
the
subject
matter
of
this
case.
it
could
be
the
reason
why
there
is
any
real
controversy
presented
here.
the
government
did
not
present
any
evidences
to
what
the
relevant
market
was
here
–
whether
there
were
extent
to
which
there
were
substitute
products
for
lock
bolts,
the
extent
to
which
lock
bolts
gave
a
party
that
was
able
to
lawfully
manufacture
them
and
the
sort
of
dominance
in
the
general
fastener
market.
the
government
in
fact
objected
when
the
defense
managed
to
get
in
some
proof
as
to
the
existence
of
substitute
products
for
lock
bolts.
now,
the
governments
in
this
case
had
a
gentlemen,
who
i
think
we
could
refer
to
us
who
as
their
star
witness.
it
was
a
mr.
robert
looker,
who
was
the
step
son
of
mr.
lou
huck,
who
is
the
founder
of
huck
manufacturing
company,
the
patentee
here
actually
is
mr.
huck
who
is
the
inventor.
he
had
been
an
officer
of
huck
until
1956
when
he
left
and
formed
his
own
company,
he
left
about
four
years
after
his
father
--
his
step-father
died.
mr.
looker
testified
and
he
chose
to
identify
the
time
of
this
as
a
meeting
that
was
held
in
1954
prior
to
the
time
that
party
is
entered
into
this
written
patent
license
agreement.
he
testified
that
at
that
meeting,
there
came
a
time
when
the
executives
asked
their
lawyers
to
step
out
of
the
room
and
that
the
presidents
of
the
two
corporations
agreed
that
while
the
patent
license
itself
would
only
provide
perhaps
for
a
two-year
exclusivity
and
a
two-year
price
restrictive
clause
that
those
features
of
the
license
would
continue
for
--
and
this
is
alternatively
given
for
the
life
of
the
patents
or
for
the
life
of
the
license.
mr.
looker
at
this
time,
at
the
time
you
testify
to
this
had
a
trouble
damage
suit
on
file
against
the
defendants.
it
was
based
on
the
failure
of
huck
to
license
the
company
that
mr.
looker
had
gone
to
under
the
huck
patent.
naturally,
it
would
be
an
important
ingredient
in
mr.
looker's
case
that
there
be
an
exclusive
feature
in
the
agreement
of
this
exclusive
feature
be
a
continuing
one
because
he
left
huck
about
the
time
that
the
two-year
period
expired
and
that
it
was
unlawful.
and
there
is
a
considerable
correspondents
that
was
brought
up
in
the
record
showing
that
mr.
looker
was
the
justice
department's
informant
in
this
matter
and
that
in
fact
as
the
district
court
found,
he
initiated
the
filing
of
this
action
by
the
justice
department.
there
was
given
an
evidence
even
in
connecting
with
the
looker's
testimony,
in
fact,
some
of
these
are
government
direct
exhibits
which
contained
contradictions.
there
was
given
an
evidence
say
considerable
number
of
memoranda
that
mr.
looker
wrote.
he
was
a
great
writer
of
memoranda
that
were
completely
inconsistent
with
the
story
that
there
was
a
continuing
price
restriction.
he
wrote
a
lot
of
memoranda
saying
that
in
september
1956,
the
price
restriction
will
expire.
in
september
1956,
we'll
be
free
to
license
anybody.
at
close
of
the
criminal
case,
criminal
case
was
tried
to
a
jury.
the
district
judge
took
the
case
away
from
the
jury
and
he
held
that
even
crediting
looker's
testimony
that
under
the
general
electric
case,
there
was
no
proof
of
any
violation
of
the
sherman
act
made
out,
and
he
granted
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
incidentally
the
government,
i'm
sure
inadvertently
in
their
the
brief
refers
to
the
district
judge
in
the
criminal
case
as
believing
mr.
looker's
testimony
when
he
says
that
the
government
showed
such
and
such
at
least
prima
facie.
now
since
he
was
sitting
with
the
jury,
there
was
no
issue
as
to
whether
he
believed
the
government
or
not,
at
this
point,
that
was
a
function
for
the
jury.
in
order
for
him
to
take
the
case
away
from
the
jury,
he
had
to
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
that
even
accepting
mr.
looker's
story
on
its
face
that
there
was
no
violation
of
law,
and
in
fact
there
is
none
under
the
general
electric
case.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
he
did.
the
party
is
then
after
the
criminal
case
was
done,
entered
in
to
stipulation
that
the
testimony
submitted
by
the
government,
in
connection
with
the
criminal
case,
would
constitute
the
government
case
in
chief
in
the
civil
case
and
now
would
constitute
the
whole
case
in
chief.
and
they
also
agreed
that
there
would
be
a
motion
filed
under
rule
41
(b),
the
motion
for
judgment
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case.
at
this
point,
we
still
have
the
government
disclaiming
that
they
said
in
the
october
1962
conferences
any
intention
to
question
the
general
electric
case.
in
fact,
we
have
their
express
statement
under
this
good
law
and
it
was
on
this
basis
that
the
stipulation
was
entered
into.
it
was
on
this
basis
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
under
rule
41
was
filed.
the
civil
case
was
before
a
different
judge
in
the
district
court
judge
machrowicz,
he
made
an
independent
analysis
of
the
record
and
he
came
to
the
same
conclusion
as
did
the
judge
in
the
criminal
case
as
to
the
issues
of
law.
as
to
the
issues
of
facts,
since
he
did
have
an
independent
fact
finding
function,
he
was
sitting
without
a
jury.
he
made
certain
findings
which
make
it
quit
clear
that
he
was
not
accepting
mr.
looker's
testimony
but
that
he
was
finding
once
again
that
even
if
you
believe
mr.
looker,
there
was
still
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act
because
of
the
general
electric
rule.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
all
he
had
was
the
record.
he
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
see
mr.
looker
on
the
stand.
there
was
no
cross-examination
of
them.
he
couldn't
have
seen
mr.
looker's
demeanor
when
the
contradictory
memoranda
were
shown
to
him
and
how
he
would
have
reacted
to
that
sort
of
things
that
a
finder
of
fact,
i'm
sure
would
be
interested
in
seeing
in
a
case
of
this
sort.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
were
no
live
witnesses
in
the
civil
case.
it
was
simply
the
transcript
of
the
government's
briefs
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
on
his
analysis
of
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
of
the
record.
he
found
that
there
was
not
any
showing
of
any
continuing
agreement
on
prices
between
the
parties
after
september
of
1956
that
was
the
time
when
the
two-year
clause
from
the
written
patent
license
expired.
he
found
that
while
generally
townsend
did
charge
in
the
period
after
‘56,
the
same
prices
as
huck,
there
were
some
instances
of
price
competition
between
them.
he
also
found
that
huck
had
in
fact
declined
license,
a
number
of
license
applicants,
both
before
and
after
the
end
of
two
year
period.
he
also
found
that
its
refusals
were
undertaken
in
the
exercise
of
huck's
own
discretion
and
without
any
participation
by
townsend,
the
licensee.
in
fact,
he
found
that
huck
license
took
concerns
to
make
titanium
lock
bolts
which
were
lock
bolts
of
the
sort
that
huck
did
not
manufacture,
that
townsend
did
not
manufacture.
the
extent
to
which
our
lock
bolts
made
of
that
metal
which
compete
with
the
lock
bolts
which
they
did
manufacture
was
not
shown
in
the
record.
and
on
the
basis
of
this,
in
citing
the
general
electric
case,
the
district
judge
granted
the
motion
under
rule
41
of
the
clause
of
the
government's
case.
there
was
no
cross-examination
of
the
government's
witnesses
in
the
civil
case.
there
were
no
proofs
put
on,
on
behalf
of
the
defendants.
there
was
no
reason
for
the
defendants
to
try
and
make
an
economic
case
showing
how
in
the
metal
fastener
industry,
the
general
electric
rule
might
be
a
matter
of
significant
economic
benefit
to
the
small
producers
to
the
small
producer
of
patented
items
which
they
would've
been
at
perfect
liberty
to
do,
had
the
government
been
challenging
the
general
electric
case?
there
was
no
reason
for
the
parties
to
get
very
fully
into
the
question
of
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
it
depends
what
the
issues
are
your
honor.
if
the
court
should
hold
the
general
electric
as
bad
law
and
should
be
overruled,
then
of
course,
we
wouldn't
have
any
opportunity
to
make
an
economic
case
to
the
district
court
to
the
effect
of
the
general
electric
case
was
good
law
and
should
not
be
overruled
because
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
that
would
be
out
of
the
district
court's
hands.
but
my
point
is
that
had
the
government
given
us
some
sort
of
notice
of
the
position
that
they
are
going
to
take
in
this
court,
in
fact,
that
they
had
not
represent
it
to
contrary,
there
would've
been
an
opportunity
in
the
district
court
to
build
a
record
that
would've
been
meaningful
to
this
court
and
would've
afforded
a
full
factual
and
economic
showing
of
the
reasons
why
the
general
electric
rule
makes
sense,
particularly,
in
terms
of
the
small
business
patentee.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
presumably
that
would've
been
factual.
we
could've
called
the
buyers
for
the
large
companies
that
are
the
consumers
of
metal
fasteners
and
the
aviation
industry,
and
the
trailer
industry,
and
the
automotive
industry,
and
we
could
have
questioned
as
them
as
to
their
practice
as
to
requiring
second
source,
when
a
small
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
with
a
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it's
--
as
far
as
the
patentee
is
concerned,
i
think,
the
ability
to
make
sure
that
his
second
source,
that
his
licensee
does
not
compete
price
wise
with
him
is
a
very
important
thing
in
his
consideration
as
to
whether
it's
not
his
second
source.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
in
that
situation
you
have
a
case
where
congress
pretty
clearly
established
a
judgment
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
in
the
white
motor
case,
if
your
honor
recalls,
there
was
a
summary
judgment
granted.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
it
was
more
than
price
fixing
but
it
was
an
attempt
to
--
in
effect
to
set
up
a
new
per
se
rule.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
concerning
things
that
go
back
for
a
trial
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
the
basic
factual
questions
as
to
whether
there
was
after
1956,
this
sort
of
agreement
would
go
back
to
the
trial
but
the
sort
of
proofs
that
the
court
indicated
that
it
wanted
in
the
white
motor
case
that
it
was
deprived
of
by
the
summary
judgment
procedure
there.
those
could
not
be
put
in
because
the
issue
would
already
have
been
decided.
in
fact,
we
would
not
have
had
an
opportunity
to
put
in
the
factual
and
economic
material
as
to
where
the
second
source
price
restrictive
license
helps.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
there
already
is
a
rule
that
restricts
these
agreements
very
narrowly
and
this
agreement
was
very
carefully
scrutinized
in
the
district
court
before
both
district
judges.
if
the
government's
position
is
nakedly
here
that
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule
without
regards
of
the
strength
or
weakness
of
the
patent,
without
regards
of
the
number
of
licensees,
without
regard
to
the
size
of
the
patentee
in
the
sort
of
industry
that
he
is
functioning
in.
the
sort
of
people
who
are
his
customers
without
regard
to
any
of
these
factors
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
he
mention
this
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
he
mentioned
the
certain
alternatives.
one
of
the
--
i
think
the
law
has
already
gone
virtually
to
the
point
where
the
only
question
is
whether
there
will
be
a
per
se
rule.
i
don't
--
i
think
that
--
you
ignore
as
equilibrium
than
the
last
step,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
are
not
presently
fixing
prices.
there
is
no
showing
that
they
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
could
on
the
other
hand
that
presents
say
question
of
fact
mr.
looker
is
testifying
that
they
are
presently
fixing
prices.
he
says
back
in
this
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
you
would
get
a
trial
on
that
but
you
would
have
any
--
never
had
any
opportunity
to
present
the
economic
questions
as
to
whether
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule
in
this
area
or
not.
that
is
what
would
be
taken
out
of
the
case
and
that
was
what
the
--
taken
out
of
the
case
by
the
procedure
that
the
government
has
followed
here.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
certainly
would
your
honor.
now,
as
to
that
whether
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
extent
to
which
the
government
proves
in
that
case
where
or
much
better
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
than
they
were
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
believe
that
at
the
time
of
the
general
electric
case
there
was
a
very
full
development
of
the
economic
issues.
on
the
other
hand
that
is
--
that
was
1926
and
this
1965.
i
will
pretend
it
were
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
there
was
your
honor.
there
--
the
government
there
indicated
in
the
district
court's
dissatisfaction
with
the
rule
of
the
general
electric
case
and
in
fact,
the
district
court
there
made
a
lot
of
findings
that
were
only
made
on
the
alternative
that
the
supreme
court
would
overrule
the
general
electric
case.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
know
if
the
parties
put
them
in
or
i
think
the
record
might
have
been
limited
again
in
that.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there's
no
showing
in
this
case
even
of
the
irrelevant
markets.
the
government
in
fact
has
expressly
claimed
in
this
case
that
proof
of
the
irrelevant
market
is
not
part
of
its
case
and
the
judge
in
the
criminal
case
with
some
amazement
recited
that
fact
and
that
was
again
their
position
in
the
civil
case
that
they
didn't
even
have
to
show
that
part.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
don't
think
we
could
raise
it
if
there
is
a
per
se
rule
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
the
rule
that
the
patentee
may
under
certain
circumstances
fix
the
prices
that
which
his
licensee
will
sell
the
patented
item.
would
henceforth
be
held
to
be
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act
that
were
the
same
--
the
same
as
if
there
were
no
patent.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
there
would
be
a
per
se
rule
as
far
as
patent
agreements
between
patentees
and
licensees.
it's
a
certain
anew
and
very
material
extension
of
the
per
se
regime
to
this
area
where
there
has
not
been
a
per
se
regime
before.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
that
of
course
comes
together
to
the
question
which
is
first
section
of
the
act.
what
you
have
here
are
two
statutes,
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
patent
laws
which
are
as
the
court
said
in
the
simpson
case
and
probably
--
none
of
these
options
that
are
available
to
patentee
is
available
to
a
person
who
doesn't
have
patent.
when
you
are
in
the
patent
situation,
you
start
with
the
very
basic
point
that
the
--
that
patentee
if
he
chooses
and
if
he
can
make
a
stiff,
need
not
have
any
competitors
whatsoever.
he
can
simply
sue
anybody
who
makes
the
infringing
devices
which
certainly
as
of
the
case
in
an
unpatented
item,
that
is
the
basic
distinction
between
the
cases.
and
from
that
for
the
last
63
years,
the
court
has
had
the
rule
that
the
patentee
made
within
certain
various
circumscribed
limits,
restrict
the
prices
of
which
the
licensee
sells
the
patented
item.
getting
into
the
procedure
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well
this,
i
think
goes
to
the
whether
you
should
believe
the
government
of
its
waiver
or
not.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
assume
that
would
be
the
result
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no.
we're
urging
the
government
should
be
held
to
its
waiver
and
that
the
court
should
not
reexamine
these
issues
and
in
fact,
it
should
summarily
affirm
without
getting
into
the
question
of
the
continuing
validity
of
the
general
electric
rule.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
waive
for
another
case,
if
this
problem
is
such
a
serious
problem,
presumably,
they'll
be
one
along
pretty
soon.
there
hasn't
been
one
in
the
last
15
years
but
if
it
is
serious
problem,
i'm
sure
they'll
be
a
case
quite
soon.
although,
i
guess
then
we
would
have
to
be
started
in
the
district
court
because
the
counsel
had
said
that
they
have
no
case
pending
presently
that
would
be
affected
by
the
result
of
this
case.
most
of
these
subsidiary
arguments,
that
we
are
making
really
go
to
the
point
that
the
government
should
be
held
to
the
very
conscious
and
very
deliberate
waiver
which
had
made
in
the
lower
court.
the
waiver
which
might
presumably
was
participated
in
as
a
senior
level
in
the
justice
department
which
we
can
infer
from
the
fact
that
the
lawyers
out
in
field
had
to
recess
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
get
advice
on
the
question.
i
would
think
that
the
rather
than
for
the
defendants
to
have
to
show
in
this
case
that
there's
a
reason
that
the
government
should
be
held
to
its
waiver.
i
would
think
that
the
government
should
have
come
forward
and
affirmatively
shown
some
reasons,
why
it
is
in
the
interest
of
justice
that
it
be
relieved
from
its
waiver?
that
after
all
is
what
rule
16
which
is
the
rule
about
pre-trial
orders
says
that
the
issue
is
framed
by
the
pre-trial
order
govern
the
subsequent
proceedings
in
the
case
unless
modified
in
the
interest
of
justice.
and
i
would
think
the
burden
of
showing
that
would
be
the
government's
burden.
we
have
shown
you
also
in
response
to
questions
the
two
respects
in
which
the
defense
relied
upon
the
waiver.
it
relied
upon
the
waiver
first
as
to
the
basic
factual
matters
as
to
whether
it
would
permit
the
transcript
of
the
criminal
case
to
be
received
an
evidence,
as
to
whether
it
would
permit
it
to
be
received
as
the
sole
evidence
of
the
government,
and
as
further
as
to
the
matter
of
whether
they
would
have
the
separate
cross-examination
in
the
civil
case
of
the
witnesses
who
had
been
called
in
the
criminal
case.
on
all
these
respects,
the
defense
in
reliance
upon
the
government's
waiver
chose
to
stand
on
the
transcript
of
the
criminal
case
being
the
exclusive
record
of
the
government's
case.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
would
hope
it
would
as
to
the
factual
matters.
i
don't
think
the
government
has
ever
conceded
in
its
briefs
that
it
would
and
the
thing
we
have
to
argue
that
out
in
the
district
court.
once
again
that,
of
course,
simply
covers
the
factual
what
i
call
the
basics
facts
as
to
who
had
done
in
this
cases
as
to
whether
they
were
evenly
as
basic
evidentiary
things
that
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
and
doesn't
solve
the
problem
as
to
whether
--
whether
this
is
the
sort
of
record
on
which
the
court
should
make
an
important
announcement
in
the
anti
trust
field
and
in
fact
in
which
the
court
should
overrule
63
years
of
several
precedents.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
at
that
point
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no.
i
think
the
district
court,
i'm
sure
can
do
the
arithmetic
in
the
from
the
line
material
case
as
well
as
the
assistant
attorney
general
did
and
i'm
quite
sure
the
district
court
would
have
received
any
economic
evidence,
and
that
the
parties
wanted
to
put
forth.
certainly,
the
defense
would
had
to
have
tendered
that
evidence
and
certainly
the
defense
would
have.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
would
think
then
--
if
he
had
done
that
--
the
appropriate
thing,
once
the
government
had
indicated
its
desire
to
get
into
this
question.
if
the
court
wanted
to
get
into
it,
i
think
the
appropriate
thing
would've
been
for
the
courts
merely
to
reverse
the
district
court's
order
for
which
so
advised
and
to
order
the
district
court
to
take
proofs,
just
as
the
court
did
in
the
white
motor
case,
where
the
district
judge
went
on
a
summary
judgment
case.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
basic
patents
here
will
expire
two
years
from
next
sunday,
november
21,
1967
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
would
think
that
even
then
the
proceeding
with
respect
to
the
ascertainment
of
looker's
credibility.
there
might
well
be
further
proofs
for
the
discovery
on
that
in
the
further
hearing.
i
think
even
if
the
remand
were
that
limited,
there
would
be
considerable
question
as
to
whether
we
might
not
get
into
a
mootness
position
on
that
but
certainly,
if
we're
going
to
get
into
a
full
case
on
the
economic
rights
and
wrongs
of
the
general
electric
rule.
i
think
if
the
government
had
started
where
it
should
have
in
this
case
and
started
trying
this
in
1961
which
is
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
on
the
basis
that
they
are
now
urging,
that
that
could've
been
done
or
if
the
areas
one,
in
which
there
are
considerable
abuses
and
the
government
can
find
another
cases
to
bring,
it
might
well
try
to
chose
a
case
where
there
was
a
little
more
than
six
years
to
go
on
the
basic
patents
at
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed.
i
think
these
are
all
relevant
considerations.
actually,
it's
only
because
you
have
a
very
strong
patent
here
i
think
that
you
have
practiced
under
it
this
late
is
17
years
of
the
life
of
the
patent.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
we
agree
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
construe
the
reference
to
general
electric
there
as
saying
that
the
court
had
no
reason
to
reexamine
one
of
the
two
holdings
of
the
general
electric
case
and
that
is
the
holding
on
the
price
restrictive
license.
the
court
there
reconsidered
and
in
effect
overruled
the
other
holding
in
the
general
electric
case,
the
so-called,
i
think,
class
b
license
as
it
is
called.
the
consignment
and
(inaudible)
agency
arrangement,
whereby
general
electric
had
a
system
of
retail
price
maintenance
on
the
light
bulbs.
but
the
other
holding
in
the
case
has
to
do
with
the
license
to
westin
house,
the
manufacturer
license.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
court
did
not
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no.
on
the
other
hand,
to
the
extent
that
simpson
case
is
the
reaffirmation
of
the
other
holding
in
the
general
electric
case
to
the
effect
that
the
manufacturing
license
is
permissible,
we,
of
course,
willingly
accept
this.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
the
question
of
the
court,
to
answer
itself.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
just
a
short
time
left
to
run
on
these
patents,
this
court
in
effect
is
being
asked
to
do
a
great
series
of
things
here.
it's
being
asked
first,
to
relieve
the
government
of
the
conscious
waiver
that
it
made
in
the
district
court.
second
is
being
asked
to
decide
in
a
fairly
major
antitrust
problem
without
an
economic
record
of
any
sort.
second
is
being
asked
to
do
that
in
a
case
that
may
well
become
moot
before
the
relief
stage
can
be
reached.
finally,
is
being
asked
to
do
that
in
a
case
where
the
opinion
of
the
court
renders
maybe
simply
an
advisory
opinion
because
there
–-
it
has
not
yet
been
a
district
court
that
is
accepted
--
district
judge
that
accepted
mr.
looker's
testimony
and
the
district
judge
in
the
civil
case
here
indicated
grave
reservations
about
it.
so,
the
matter
what
the
court
maybe
being
urged
to
do
here
and
to
overcome
very
considerable
procedural
barriers
and
very
considerable
barriers
imposed
by,
we
submit,
maintaining
an
orderly
system
of
litigation
and
an
orderly
system
of
pre-trialing
antitrust
cases.
may
simply
be
a
render
in
advisory
opinion,
if
there
had
been
a
full
record
generated
in
this
case
on
the
economic
question,
there
are
a
number
of
topics
that
we
would've
proposed
to
put
proof
in
on.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
believe
the
economic
proofs
were
extensive
there,
your
honor.
as
i
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
number
of
issues
involved
and
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
there
was
attacking
the
practice.
you
had
a
pretty
broad
scope
of
the
way
that
light
bulbs
were
marketed.
and
of
course,
there
was
one
concern
in
the
general
electric
that
was
obvious
on
the
face
of
that
that
by
no
means
obvious
in
this
case.
in
the
general
electric
situation,
you're
dealing
with
three
of
the
very
basic
patents
on
electric
light
bulbs.
it
was,
i
think
impossible
to
make
electric
light
bulbs
in
the
1920's
without
infringing
those
patents.
it
is
very
hard
to
say
that
there
are
substitutes
for
electric
light
bulbs
of
any
sort
of
feasible
sort.
it
would
be
rather
hard
to
say
as
by
as
the
1920'
that
gas
light
was
a
substitute.
on
the
other
hand,
what
you
have
here
is
just
one
form
of
metal
fastening
among
a
lot
of
forms
in
metal
fastening.
if
the
aircraft
manufacturers
and
the
trailer
manufacturers,
and
the
bus
manufacturers
don't
like
the
way
that
these
fasteners
work
or
that
they
don't
like
the
fact
that
there's
only
one
source
for
them
or
if
they
don't
like
the
prices
that
they're
being
charged.
they
can
go
in
to
nuts
and
bolts.
they
can
go
into
rivets.
they
can
go
into
a
variety
of
other
specialized
fasteners
that
would
not
infringe
the
patents
here.
this
is
a
matter
that
we
were
able
to
get
into
some
extent
in
the
record
but
to
as
to
which
the
government
objected
very
strongly
and
the
proofs
were
very
limited.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
these
days
your
honor.
antitrust
cases
would
come
to
recognize
and
i
think
this
is
definitely
a
good
trend,
they
have
to
have
--
we're
dealing
with
two
statutes
here
which
have
the
basic
economic
purposes.
it's
a
question
of
reconciling
them.
i
don't
think
we
can
sit
down
and
treat
this
like
a
law
school
examination
and
trying
to
do
things
from
the
nature
of
the
patent
laws
and
to
do
things
from
the
nature
of
the
antitrust
laws.
i
think
we
have
to
see
at
least
in
one
industry,
at
least
in
the
metal
fastener
industry,
if
that's
the
industry
that
the
government
wants
to
make
a
test
case.
i
think
we
have
to
see
how
this
form
of
restriction
works
out,
whether
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
patentee
could
as
a
legal
matter
exclude
all
others
from
manufacturing
the
devices
in
question,
whether
in
the
light
of
that
fact
which
is
one
of
the
starting
points
in
this
case.
there's
a
net
gain
for
competition
here
in
the
fact
that
because
the
patentee
can
create
this
second
source
on
an
acceptable
basis.
that
form
of
a
fastener
then
can
be
post
by
the
large
buyers
in
the
airplane
industry
and
the
buyers
in
the
bus
industry,
and
the
buyers
in
the
truck
industry,
and
that
this
patentee
can
therefore
have
the
rewards
of
the
patent
system.
but
he
doesn't
have
to
license
--
that
he
doesn't
have
to
sell
his
patent
to
someone
else
and
that
we
are
then
remitted
to
the
government
bringing
some
other
sort
of
lawsuit
to
try
and
commit
that.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
there
would
be
evidence
as
to
what
their
usual
requirements
of
buy-in
corporations
are
in
the
present
day
economy,
the
extent
to
which
they
demand
second
sources.
the
extent
to
which
they
demand
second
sources,
when
the
first
source
is
a
small
business
corporation,
i'm
sure
they
don't
demand
the
second
source
if
one
of
the
gm
component
divisions
comes
forward
with
the
new
component.
but
it's
--
there
is
some
evidence
on
this
record
that
when
huck
manufacturing
company,
which
is
a
small
company,
came
forward
with
a
new
method
of
fastening
that
the
government
and
the
other
large
buyers
wanted
a
second
source.
i
think
then
we
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
you
have
to
look
into
the
reality
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
but
you
don't
get
--
you
probably
would
in
a
number
of
cases
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
remains
here
that
this
businessman
had
the
right
to
keep
a
second
source
from
going
into
business,
whereas
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
whether
if
this
kind
of
business
it
is
not
(voice
overlap)
and
of
course
the
--
that
evidence
is
not
--
the
evidence
of
the
business
when
it
is
not
conclusive
without
this
other
means
of
contradicting
this.
and
if
the
government
wants
to
bring
some
creativity
to
the
matter,
presumably,
make
an
economic
case
too
or
they
could
try
to
make
one.
the
suggestion
i
have
to
make
on
the
present
record
is
that
the
government
might
be
asserting
here
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
that
an
economic
case
because
it
never
has
tried
and
they
didn't
try
here,
for
some
reason
or
other,
it
waived
the
question
below.
but
if
it
had
not,
i
assume
that
the
government
is
in
a
position
to
put
on
proofs
of
that
matter
and
that
we
are
not
restricted
to
the
more
speculative
arguments
that
the
government
has
put
forward
in
its
brief.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
that
might
in
a
particular
case.
again,
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
actually
is
an
exception
to
the
general
electric
case
that
the
--
in
fact
the
government
tried
to
make
out
a
case
of
that
here,
that
if
you
get
into
a
situation
where
the
licensee
becomes
dominant,
where
the
licensee
is
starting
to
call
the
shots,
but
that
can
go
outside
the
general
electric
rule,
if
the
privilege
is
essentially
the
patentees
and
that
it's
for
his
benefit
that
the
rule
exists.
i
think
the
method
to
what
we
would
have
shown,
would
have
been
that
despite
the
name
of
the
general
electric
case,
the
general
electric
rule
at
this
point
is
so
limited
that
the
very
large
manufacturing
companies
will
happen
to
own
patents,
have
no
real
use
for
it.
the
main
use
comes
in
the
case
of
the
smaller
patentees
and
it
would
--
the
various
restrictions
that
the
courts
have
engrafted
on
the
general
electric
case,
basically
are
the
ones
that
make
it
in
unsuitable
vehicle
for
a
dominant
producer
of
a
large
corporation
that
has
considerable
economic
muscle
from
using
the
general
electric
privilege.
what's
left
of
the
general
electric
rule
and
the
general
electric
rule
is
still
practiced
under.
there
have
been
several
private
lawsuits
in
the
last
15
years
which
revealed
that
there
were
single
second
source
licenses
with
price
restrictive
clause
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
government
has
not
attacked
any
of
them.
and
there
are
other
applications
which
are
never
challenged
as
i
understand
it.
this
is
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
in
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
pomeroy,
will
get
into
this
a
little
further
but
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
oral
agreement
was
before
--
the
alleged
oral
agreement
was
before
the
written
agreement.
and
in
effect
to
what
it
was,
was
an
agreement
that
while
the
face
of
the
license
would
say
in
clause
12,
that
there
would
be
a
price
restriction
for
two
years
and
an
exclusivity
feature
for
two
years,
really
what
the
parties
mentioned
what
they
would
live
up
to
and
in
effect
what
is
their
agreement
was
that
those
two
clauses
would
run
for
the
life
of
the
patent
license.
so
in
effect,
the
--
what
you
had
according
to
looker's
testimony
was
an
oral
17-year
or
i
guess
there
were
13
years
then
left
in
the
patent,
an
oral
13-year
general
electric
license.
so
on
our
review,
if
the
court
holds
the
government
to
its
waiver
and
doesn't
require
into
the
continued
validity
of
general
electric,
there
should
be
an
affirmance
without
respect
to
whether
there
was
the
oral
agreement
or
not.
