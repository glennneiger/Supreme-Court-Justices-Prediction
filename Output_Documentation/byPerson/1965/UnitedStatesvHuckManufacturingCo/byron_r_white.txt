justice
byron
r.
white
like
the
per
se
price
fixing
rules,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
what
i
got
from
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
and
i
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
just
a
minute.
if
the
government
has
waived
its
right
to
raise
this
matter
here,
i
don't
suppose
it
makes
so
much
difference
as
to
the
record
made
in
the
lower
court
or
not
on
which
a
decision
could
be
made
of
in
the
general
electric
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
you're
urging
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
was
waived
for
another
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
government
had
them
in
the
district
court,
mr,
lyons,
and
if
that
you
said
the
--
what
we
urge
that
the
general
electric
is
no
longer
good
law
and
what
the
district
court
supposedly
have
done
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
probably
they
say
that
we
would
take
at
the
supreme
court
with
me,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i'm
just
wondering
about
that
mr.
lyons,
that
that's
a
lengthy
business,
the
district
judge
after
all,
in
citing
the
cases,
no
matter
what
the
arithmetic
maybe,
the
authority
is
still
outstanding.
i
would
suppose
the
district
court
would
say,
well,
this
is
just
what
has
been
suggested
to
take
to
supreme
court.
why
should
i
waste
my
time
making
a
record,
still
a
good
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lyons,
if
there
--
was
there
are
good
deal
of
--
united
states
in
the
record
on
the
ge
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
suggest
that
general
electric
is
more
of
the
decision
that
it
is
no
better
than
the
economic
evidence
record
that
it
supports
them
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lyons,
do
you
think
it
would
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
if
the
origin
of
the
price
fix
was
the
demand
of
the
licensee,
the
patentee
was
not
interested
at
all
in
the
price
fix,
except
it
just
couldn't
get
a
licensee
without
a
price
fix,
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
argument?
