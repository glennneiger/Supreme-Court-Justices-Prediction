but
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
they
did
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anyway,
it's
not
like
wilcox,
the
tax
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
base
it
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
line
material
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
that
this
was
where
any
economic
facts
as
to
what
the
effect
of
overruling
general
electric
would
be
in
that
case,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
all
is
just
the
irrelevant
markets
may?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
of
it
recovered
things
like
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
since
the
case
went
off
on
general
electric,
you
could
raise
all
that
and
then
reach
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that
per
se,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
so
then
you
already
have
a
per
se
rule
on
price
fixing
and
we
wouldn't
be
announcing
any
per
se
rule.
we
would
just
be
announcing
that
patents
do
not
have
--
patentees
do
not
have
that
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
it's
been
--
i
would
say
the
exception
to
the
rule,
hasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
say
the
simpson
don't
you
agree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
construe
that
like
the
justice
stewart
or
how
do
you
construe
the
reference
to
general
electric?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
unless
you
are
risk
taking,
there,
i
thought
that
the
court
held
that
where
you
had
consignment
coupled
with,
of
course,
tactics,
that
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
didn't
say
that
the
license
itself
was
made?
