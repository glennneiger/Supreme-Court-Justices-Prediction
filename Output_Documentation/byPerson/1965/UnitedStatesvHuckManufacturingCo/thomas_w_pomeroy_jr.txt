mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
should
there
be
a
remand
on
that
because
i
suppose
it
might
be
argued
that
independently,
the
general
electric
case,
the
price
fixing
here
was
a
result
of
this
alleged
agreement
which
had
no
relation
of
the
fixing
of
a
condition,
the
condition
of
the
patent?
mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
as
mr.
lyons
said
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
i
was
going
to
speak
a
little
bit
about
this
question
of
the
so-called
oral
agreement
or
side
agreement
and
i'll
be
glad
to
speak
about
as
much
as
time
permits
but
i
don't
really
see
the
necessity
for
it
in
the
light
of
the
way
my
brother
for
the
government
has
pitched
the
case
here
this
morning
because
he
said
in
his
oral
argument
that
he
viewed
point
two
of
the
government's
brief
with
something
less
than
enthusiasm.
and
actually
as
it's
put
in
the
brief,
i
sort
of
got
that
impression
because
it's
only
three
pages
out
of
the
very
considerable
number
of
pages
at
the
--
in
the
lower
court,
it
is
quite
true
that
this
side
agreement
was
looked
upon
as
more
or
less
the
(inaudible)
might
say,
it
was
really
what
the
government
was
shooting
for
as
an
elicit,
non-general
electric
type
of
price
fixing
and
non-patent
kind
of
price
fixing
almost
in
effect.
but
as
it
has
developed
on
appeal,
this
appeal
is
pitched
almost
entirely
on
the
naked
question
there
to
sustain
or
to
overrule
general
electric
and
not
on
this
other
matter.
now,
as
of
--
just
to
pursue
that
just
one
step
further
as
in
this
and
as
to
repeat
clearly
what
mr.
lyons
said,
the
court
below
and
the
witness
looker,
i
should
say,
that
witness
looker
and
the
court
below
construed
this
oral
agreement
to
make
the
price
fixing
for
the
life
of
the
patent.
and
also
to
keep
the
patent
exclusive
for
the
same
period,
merely
a
supplement
to
or
a
minimum
power
to
the
written
agreement
which
was
a
normal
and
straight
forward
ordinary
kind
of
patent
license
agreement
which
is
in
the
record
as
gx
17
and
which
appears
at
page
469
of
the
record
here,
and
as
was
brought
out
in
an
answer
to
a
prior
question,
i'm
quite
--
to
the
contrary
of
the
impression
which
mr.
turner
gave
that
there
was
some
effort
to
conceal
this
arrangement,
it
is
set
forth
in
an
extensive
--
in
paragraph
12
of
the
written
agreement
and
the
gist
and
the
thrust
of
the
looker
testimony
really
was
that
for
some
reason
or
another
the
parties
orally
agreed
to
make
this
not
just
the
two-year
deal
but
a
13-year
arrangement.
mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
both
--
mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
--
perfectly
aspect
of
the
market.
mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
no,
the
court
did
not
--
except
mr.
looker
really
--
he
said
this
mr.
looker
testified
that
he
did
not
find
--
mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
--
that
what
looker
testified
too
was
a
fact
because
there
were
so
much
obvious
inconsistency
in
the
looker
testimony.
his
testimony
was
carefully
structured,
you
might
say
and
it
was
so
belied
by
other
documentary
evidence
namely
that
licenses
were
considered
after
--
immediately
after
the
two-year
period
by
huck
and
so
forth
that
it
does
--
it
didn't
seem
to
(inaudible)
but
there
was
no
countervailing
evidence.
and
i
think
when
the
government
says
that,
we
the
appellees
were
denying
this
arrangement.
it
is
true
that
we
were
denying
the
looker
version
of
the
thing
but
of
course,
no
testimony
ever
went
into
the
record
on
that
and
our
position
against
it
as
disposed
only
by
the
answer
in
the
case
and
by
our
cross-examination
of
mr.
looker.
mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
you're
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
pomeroy,
jr.
i
think
it
was
b
your
honor.
they
said
that
--
i
think
the
court
looked
at
it
as
if
the
written
agreement
itself
had
provided
for
price
maintenance
for
the
life
of
agreement
of
the
patent
license,
in
the
patent
rather
and
for
exclusiveness
for
the
same
period
of
time.
that
was
just
an
oral
amendment
or
supplement
and
the
court
said
that
under
ge,
this
is
alright.
the
court
went
further
to
say
that
the
--
in
the
post
two-year
period,
there
was
no
evidence
whatever
that
townsend,
the
licensee
whom
i
was
represented
--
do
represent,
was
encroaching
the
patentees'
position
as
the
one
who
should
decide
whether
or
not
to
grant
additional
licensees.
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
to
show
any
kind
of
consultation
on
this
subject
or
control
by
the
licensee,
of
who
else
should
be
admitted
or
whether
anybody
else
should
be
admitted.
and
in
fact
as
the
record
show
the
couple
of
titanium
manufacturers
were
admitted
as
licensees
in
this
period.
the
points
that
mr.
lyons
has
made
i
think
almost
complete
the
case,
your
honor,
except
to
say
that
in
addition
to
asking
you
to
overrule
long
standing
precedent
where
there's
been
a
waiver
that
this
wasn't
being
attempted
and
we're
as
we
say,
the
record
was
willfully
inadequate.
the
government
is
also
saying
that
you
should
do
this
because
the
case
involved,
general
electric
has
been
so
devitalized
that
it
might
as
well
now
be
buried
and
we
respectfully
dissent
from
this
conclusion.
general
electric
has
not
in
fact
been
weakened.
it
has
been,
i
think
defined
and
be
limited
and
clarified
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
new
wrinkle
and
masonite,
line
material
and
gipson,
all
cases
in
the
1940's.
and
these
basic
cases
plus
a
number
of
lower
court
cases
in
the
same
general
period
has
served
very
adequately
to
clearly
set
forth
what
general
electric
does
not
permit.
general
electric
does
not
permit
predatory
attempts
at
cartelization
of
industries
or
regimenting
of
an
industry,
as
this
court
called
it
in
the
gipson
case
and
these
attempts
apparently
have
now
falling
by
the
way
side.
at
the
same
time
that
these
cases
that
i
referred
to,
were
being
decided
in
this
court.
there
were
the
congressional
amendments
introduced
which
had
mr.
justice
harlan
inquired
about.
these
were
all
in
the
1940's
and
it
is
of
course
true
that
this
may
have
been
the
judge-made
law,
judge-made
rule
but
certainly
congress
could
have
spoken
to
them,
to
the
problem
had
it
wanted
to.
especially
when
it
was
recasting
the
entire
patent
code,
but
it
felt
that
not
to
do
so
and
i
suggest
it
may
well
seem
fit
not
to
do
so
because
of
the
clarification,
clarity
that
emerged
from
new
wrinkle
and
gipson
and
masonite
and
line
material.
there
wasn't
any
need
for
further
legislation
at
that
time.
so
the
scope
of
ge
is
well
settled.
to
speak
for
just
one
other
point,
the
government
has
said
that
the
case
has
been
a
pernicious
breeder
of
litigation
over
the
years
and
that
this
is
another
reason
why
it
should
be
taken
into
the
per
se
area
where
litigation
is
perhaps
simpler
for
the
government
at
least.
but
in
their
brief,
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it.
they
cite
only
three
cases
in
the
last
decade
where
this
question
has
been
presented
and
in
the
prior
of
seven
years,
in
fact,
to
line
material
in
1946,
there
are
only
four
other
cases
as
i
recall
it.
five
others
perhaps
and
out
of
these
--
six
out
of
the
total
of
eight
have
been
settled
by
consent
decree.
only
one
went
to
trial
that
was
preznoff
or
perhaps
there
were
two
that
went
to
trial.
but
in
any
event,
there's
been
no
space
of
litigation
in
this
area
and
there
is
no
reason
that
we
can
see
why
per
se
should
be
invoked
here
against
the
60
year
old
precedent.
thank
you,
sir.
