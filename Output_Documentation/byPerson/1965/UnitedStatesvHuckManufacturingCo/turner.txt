mr.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
from
a
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
dismissing
the
government’s
civil
antitrust
suit
against
huck
manufacturing
company
and
townsend
company
the
appellee
is
here.
i
shall
recount
the
facts
substantially
stated
in
the
government's
brief.
the
complaint
alleged
that
two
companies
had
violated
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
by
restraining
trade
and
conspiring
to
monopolize
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
patented
lock
vaults
which
were
metal
fastening
devices
used
principally
in
the
construction
of
aircraft.
more
precisely,
the
charge
was
the
clock,
the
patentee
in
townsend,
its
licensee,
had
agreed
that
townsend
would
sell
patent
products
at
the
prices
and
on
the
terms
and
conditions
fixed
by
huck.
and
that
huck
would
issue
no
additional
licenses
under
its
patent.
in
earlier
criminal
proceeding,
involving
the
same
charge
have
been
dismissed
by
another
district
judge
in
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case
on
the
ground
that
the
facts
established
did
not
constitute
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
without
evidence
that
what
was
obtained
by
defendants
by
their
alleged
agreements
was
more
than
a
normal
and
reasonable
reward
to
a
patentee.
by
stipulation
of
the
parties,
the
record
in
the
criminal
case
was
introduced
into
evidence
as
a
government's
case
in
cheat
in
this
civil
action.
and
on
that
record,
the
district
court
granted
defendant's
motions
to
be
dismissed,
although,
the
defense
has
not
yet
put
in
its
case,
huck
and
townsend
have
vigorously
denied
and
do
vigorously
denied
the
existence
of
the
oral
agreement
to
fix
prices
which
the
government's
proof
purported
to
show
and
maintain
the
exclusivity
of
townsend's
license
in
which
the
government's
proof
also
purported
to
show.
the
district
court
made
no
finding
on
the
existing
--
mr.
turner
well,
the
government
put
an
evidence
mr.
justice
attending
to
show
that
there
was
a
mutual
agreement
between
the
patentee
on
the
one
hand
and
the
licensee
on
the
other.
mr.
turner
whereby
that
patentee
would
license
no
one
else,
so
long
as
the
licensee
abided
by
the
patentee's
prices.
now,
the
district
court
made
no
finding
on
the
existence
of
this
agreement.
but
on
the
assumption
and
if
we
read
the
opinion
that
an
agreement
did
exist,
the
court
concluded
and
i
quote
here,
“that
upon
the
evidence
submitted,
the
case
at
bar
is
in
all
material
respects,
the
same
and
ruled
by
the
decision
in
us
v.
general
electric.”
and
a
court
further
ruled
and
i
again
quote,
“there
is
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act
by
huck's
establishment
of
the
prices,
terms,
and
conditions
of
sale
for
the
patent
lock
vaults
and
the
following
thereof
by
the
licensee
townsend
or
it
is
established
law
under
the
general
electric
case
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
for
licensee
to
follow
the
terms,
prices,
and
conditions
of
sale
or
patent
owner
by
agreement
to
do
so.”
now,
the
government
in
its
appeal
has
contended
that
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
for
either
of
two
reasons.
first,
and
our
main
reason
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
us
v.
general
electric
that
a
license
to
make
a
patented
article
on
conditions
of
the
licensee
maintains
its
prices
at
a
level
set
by
the
patentee
does
not
in
and
out
of
itself
violate
the
sherman
act,
that's
the
rule
in
general
electric
was
erroneous
and
should
be
overruled.
or
secondly,
that
in
any
event,
the
general
electric
decision
should
not
be
interpreted
to
protect
an
agreement
by
a
patentee,
not
to
grant
additional
licenses
as
long
as
its
licensee
follows
the
prices
which
he
sets.
mr.
turner
now,
before
turning
to
a
consideration
of
the
issues
--
these
issues
on
the
merits,
i
should
like
to
discuss
briefly
and
all
the
way,
we'll
have
to
come
back
to
it
again,
a
question
raised
by
defendant
and
fairly
read,
namely
whether
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
the
issue
whether
the
general
electric
decision
should
be
overruled.
that
issue
was
raised
by
the
following
facts.
subsequent
to
the
entry
of
the
judgment
below
and
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
the
district
court
granted
defendant's
motion
to
supplement
the
record
by
adding
two
pretrial
orders.
these
orders
had
been
drafted
by
the
court
in
1962
submitted
to
counsel,
the
suggestions
and
signed
by
the
judge,
but
contrary
to
belief
of
all
counsel
had
not
been
entered
on
the
record.
the
government
did
not
object
to
this
much
of
the
motion
by
defendant.
in
addition,
however,
at
the
request
of
the
defendants
and
although
the
government's
vigorous
objection,
the
district
court
added
the
following
statement
to
one
of
the
pretrial
orders
and
i
again
i
quote,
“on
october
15,
which
is
the
date
of
the
pretrial
hearing,
reporting
on
the
applicability
of
the
general
electric
case.
the
government
stated
that
it
is
not
attempting
to
have
a
doctrine
set
in
the
general
electric
case
overruled
and
stated
only
that
facts
in
this
case
do
not
follow
in
that
doctrine.
that
the
doctrine
is
a
still
good
law
but
does
not
apply
as
the
actions
in
this
case
are
illegal
without
the
application
of
the
doctrine
and
that
it
will
write
a
letter
by
december
29
describing
in
what
way
the
facts
of
this
case
differed
from
the
facts
of
the
general
electric
case.”
that
letter
was
subsequently
written
and
was
incorporated
in
the
record.
chief
justice?
mr.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
we
accept
this
finding
of
the
district
judge
because
on
this
record,
we
do
not
feel
we
can
reasonably
maintain
that
it
is
clearly
erroneous.
well,
after
--
mr.
turner
yes.
mr.
turner
no,
sir.
it
is
not.
mr.
turner
i
like
to
set
forth
briefly
mr.
chief
justice
the
reason
why
we
feel
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
this
issue
here.
we,
of
course,
would
not
think
of
the
defending
this
is
ordinary
good
practice.
mr.
turner
we
would,
of
course,
not
think
of
defending
this
as
standard
practice
and
we
are
not
happy
that
it
occurred.
let
me
now
talk
about
the
issue
about.
mr.
turner
yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
turner
well,
mr.
chief
justice
these
appellees,
i
believe
agreed
in
their
motion
to
affirm
what
is
involved
here
is
a
question
not
of
jurisdictional
part
of
the
courts
considering
the
issue
but
whether
in
the
circumstances
it
should.
we
believe
that
the
pertinent
issues
which
would
principally
for
a
pertinent
findings
which
would
particularly
foreclose
the
court
from
considering
the
issue
are
not
present.
the
issues
it
is
whether
the
failure
of
the
government
to
attack
general
electric
below
makes
it
unfair
to
appellees
to
consider
the
issue
here.
and
second,
and
this
is
a
closely
related
question,
does
the
failure
of
the
government
to
raise
the
issue
below
deprive
this
court
of
any
significant
record
material
which
would
materially
assist
this
court
or
would've
materially
assisted
this
court
in
deciding
the
issue
presented.
mr.
turner
yes.
mr.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
turner
no,
this
is
on
--
this
is
on
the
still
sides,
sir.
this
is
the
part
of
the
record
in
the
civil
case.
this
occurred
after
the
judgment
in.
mr.
turner
well,
the
government
as
i
say
below
when
the
defendants
proposed
that
this
particular
language
be
inserted,
proposed
it
very
strongly
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
reflect
the
position
that
the
government
trial
counsel
had
in
fact
taken
in
the
pre-trial
hearing.
this
statement
is
taken
almost
verbatim
from
a
memorandum
on
the
meeting
apparently
taken
by
the
judge
lockeford,
and
that
was
the
basis
apparently
on
which
the
judge
granted
the
defendant's
motion
to
assert
this.
as
i
say
we
are
in
a
rather
difficult
position
where
we
did
not
agree
that
this
was
a
correct
statement
below
but
it
is
rather
hard
for
us
to
maintain
here
that
that
finding
was
clearly
erroneous.
i
can
honestly
say
that
we
believe
it
is
doubtful
in
fact
the
government
did
not
do
this
but
i
really
can't
do
much
better
than
that.
mr.
turner
i
think
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
fair.
that
is
right
and
--
and
it
is
my
job
to
persuade
you
that
despite
this
the
issue
should
be
reached.
mr.
turner
yes.
the
government
has
attacked
the
general
electric
case
repeatedly
over
the
years.
this
is
not
here
a
novel
position
on
the
part
of
the
government.
mr.
turner
i
might
know
that
in
some
of
the
cases
in
the
past,
at
least
one,
and
i
think
a
fair
rating
of
the
second
case
would
lead
to
two
that
that
substantially
this
has
been
done
--
occurred
before
that
is
or
that
is
in
the
gipson
case
--
u.s.
gipson
case
and
inline
material,
the
government
in
its
--
before
the
court
below
and
in
its
trial
brief
now
urged
conviction
or
judgment
as
a
case
may
have
been
on
the
basis
that
the
facts
alleged
went
beyond
the
scope
of
general
electric.
it
did
not
attack
--
it
did
not
say
that
it
was
asking
the
district
court
to
overrule
the
general
electric
case
in
one
of
those
cases
inline
material
the
trial
court
brief
--
the
trail
brief
of
the
government
did
not
speak
finally
of
the
general
electric
case.
they
did
not
say
that
it
was
taken
the
position,
that
the
decision
should
be
overruled.
and
i
must
say
in
fairness
to
--
mr.
turner
well
in
both
the
cases,
the
government
argued
before
this
court
that
ge
should
be
overrule
and
as
you
know,
in
the
one
case,
the
issue
was
not
reached
and
inline
material
where
as
four
judges
concurred
on
the
ground
that
should
be
overrule
of
the
deciding
vote
by
justice
reed
did
not
take
that
position
beside
decisive
opinion
on
this
question
did
not
take
that
position.
and
i
must
say
in
neither
of
those
cases
was
this
point
urged
that
is
a
point
of
waiver
anything
like
that
urged
by
the
appellees
and
of
course
appellees
are
earnestly
pursuing
the
issue
here.
mr.
turner
that's
correct
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
turner
the
report
incurred
as
i
recall
justice
reed
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
with
which
four
justices
concurred
but
wrote
a
separating
concurring
opinion
saying
they
would've
held
the
way
that
the
court
held
on
the
basis
of
general
electric
should
be
overruled.
mr.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
turner
i
hope
to
have
some
replacement
sir.
mr.
turner
let
me
say
again,
that
i
will
eventually,
and
i
have
to
deal
fully
with
the
question
of
waiver.
i
just
want
to
say
again
at
this
point
that
the
court
is
free
if
it
thinks
it
appropriate
to
consider
this
issue
and
we
urge
that
the
issue
isn't
sufficient
importance
that
it
should,
and
further
that
we
urge
that
it
is
not
--
would
not
be
unfair
to
the
appellees
to
do
so
and
finally
that
the
failure
to
do
so
has
not
deprived
this
court
anything
of
any
particular
use.
now,
in
connection
with
this,
i
will
say
further
at
this
point
the
government
did
contend
below
as
it's
now
contending
that
the
general
electric
rule
should
not
be
extended
to
cover
the
case
whereas
here
according
to
the
government's
allegations
the
patentee
agreed
not
to
grant
additional
licenses
as
long
as
the
licensee
abides
by
its
prices.
that
is
to
say,
the
government
did
take
the
position
below.
and
of
course
again
does
here
that
a
combination
of
an
exclusive
license
with
a
price
fixing
clause
should
not
come
within
the
ambit
of
ge's
protection.
now,
as
i
read
the
appellees
brief
to
agree
or
substantially
agree
that
position
raises
almost
all,
if
not
all
of
the
relevant,
the
factual
legal
considerations
that
a
outright
attack
on
the
ge
rule
does
because
it
virtually
destroys
ge
and
i
must
say
this
in
all
candor.
if,
as
appellees
urge
and
we
do
not
agree
on
this
point,
the
ge
rule
is
confined
to
a
price
fixing
clause
in
a
single
license
and
the
government
urged
below
that
where
the
license
is
exclusive
the
price
fixing
clause
is
unlawful.
what
is
left
of
general
electric
is
very
hard
detect?
so,
at
least
insofar
as
the
unfairness
issue
is
concerned
we
believe
that
the
government's
position
below
put
appellees
to
the
kind
of
proof
which
they
urge
now
that
they
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
put
in.
but
beyond
this,
and
this
is
really
the
most
important
part
that
what
i
want
to
say,
at
least
for
the
moment
with
you.
we
contend
that
the
relevant,
factual
and
legal
issues
raised
by
the
ge
rule
are
simply
not
issues
on
which
any
record
would
have
provided
this
court
with
any
material
help
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
think
it
is
appropriate
now,
although
i
will
come
back
again
to
the
question
of
the
court
and
as
of
dealing
with
the
issue,
appropriate
now
to
take
a
careful
look
at
the
merits
because
if
we
are
right
on
this,
we
think
the
court
should
take
this
opportunity
to
overrule
the
general
electric
case.
mr.
turner
of
course.
mr.
turner
of
course.
mr.
turner
of
course.
there
has
been
no
finding
really
by
the
district
judge
--
(voice
overlap)
it
was
in
assumption.
mr.
turner
--
and
of
course,
what
we
asked
for
even
on
the
assumption
that
you
would
overrule
general
electric
is
not
a
final
judgment
but
simply
a
reversal
on
--
and
a
remand
with
directions
to
the
court
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
ruling
that
the
general
electric
rule
is
no
longer
a
good
law.
mr.
turner
yes?
mr.
turner
it
has
sir
about
two
years
to
run
i
believe.
mr.
turner
i
have
no
idea
what
will
happen
to
the
lawsuit.
mr.
turner
the
defendants
at
the
least
have
the
opportunity
to
put
in
the
additional
proof.
it's
conceivable
that
the
additional
--
mr.
turner
what
the
eventual
outcome
of
the
case
might
be
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
really
has
an
important
bearing
on
whether
the
court
--
mr.
turner
i
would
say
not
sir.
i
think,
you
know,
if
the
issue
is
important
one
and
you
are
convinced
by
what
else
i
have
to
say
that
you
should
reach
it,
i
would
not
think
that
the
eventual
possibility
of
the
case
would
wash
out
should
a
deterrent.
mr.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
insist
suggested
that
i
proceed
to
a
discussion
on
the
merits
of
the
ge
rule
because
i
think,
the
merits
of
the
position
that
as
we
see
them
have
a
very
strong
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
should
decide
that
issue.
i
will
give
only
the
brief
as
of
historical
reviews
because
the
court
is
quite
familiar
with
these
cases.
the
problem
of
the
right
of
a
patentee
to
insert
a
price
fixing
limitation
in
a
license
has
been
with
us
for
over
60
years.
when
it
first
came
to
this
court
and
they
met
the
hero,
the
court
decided
that
it
was
alright.
apparently,
on
the
basis
that
since
the
patent
granted
a
monopoly
and
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
patent
statute
was
monopoly
that
any
restrictions
otherwise
not
contravention
of
public
policy
would
be
alright
if
it
all
they
did
was
maintain
that
monopoly.
intervening

the

and
general
electric
where
the
beament
rule
was
reaffirmed,
cast
considerable
doubt
on
the
proposition
that
beament
was
still
a
good
law.
i
think
probably
motion
picture
patents
was
most
significant.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
within
the
right
of
the
patent
--
not
within
the
patent
right
to
license
or
sell
the
patented
product
on
condition
that
the
licensee
or
purchaser
by
other
non-patented
items
from
the
patentee.
the
court
said
that
any
such
agreement
or
any
restrictions
in
connections
with
the
contract
of
license
or
sale
would
be
decided
by
general
law.
they
were
not
logically
a
part
of
patent
grant.
now,
whatever
maybe
said
about
the
reasoning
motion
picture
patents
as
i
say,
it
indicated
a
fundamentally
different
approach
to
the
general
area
of
patent
licensing
restrictions.
subsequent
cases,
reasserting
the
proposition
that
a
patentee
could
not
impose
resell
price
restrictions
on
purchases
from
him
and
the
development
of
other
law
in
the
--
in
the
tying
area
suggested
that
when
the
issue
came
to
this
court
again,
it
would
decide
the
other
way
but
it
did
not
as
we
know.
now
in
general
electric,
the
rule
was
reaffirmed
on
the
basis
that
the
restriction
was
as
the
court
put
it
normally
and
reasonably
adapted
to
secure
the
patentees
pecuniary
reward.
again,
subsequent
cases,
all
demonstrated
a
considerable
lack
of
confidence
to
say
the
least
in
the
court's
view
and
the
ge
rule,
it
was
not
in
any
significant
decision.
the
basis
for
absolving
price
fixing
restrictions
and
in
mason
--
pardon
me,
inline
material
four
judges
of
this
court
were
prepared
to
overrule
general
electric.
now,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
now
if
not
at
an
earlier
point.
it
is
clear
that
neither
that
the
beament
case
nor
the
general
electric
case
provided
an
adequate
underpinning
for
the
result
because
they
did
not
deal
with
what
may
now
be
seen
to
be
the
real
questions
and
those
questions
are
these.
first,
whether
the
grant
of
the
rights
to
price
fix
and
a
license
makes
any
detectable
contribution
to
the
main
purpose
of
the
patent
laws,
a
proposition
which
the
beament
case
and
ge
simply
assumed.
second,
whether
if
it
does
not
and
i
believe
it
is
clear
that
it
does
not
make
any
contribution
to
patent
policy
at
all.
if
promotes
or
detracts
from
a
pro-competitive
fallacy
which
is
the
core
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
as
i
say
we
believe
a
careful
examination
of
these
questions
which
is
clearly
to
conclusion
that
ge
was
wrong
and
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
deal
with
issue
should
over
--
it
should
be
overruled.
now,
first,
we
maintain
that
contrary
to
what
was
assumed
in
general
electric,
the
decision
whether
or
not
permitted
patentee
to
put
a
price
fixing
clause
in
his
license
makes
no
detectable
contribution
of
the
purpose
the
patent
law
whatsoever
and
they
end
up
to
treat
the
issue
as
one
of
reconciling
patent
law
and
anti-trust
law
is
itself
a
mistake.
the
purpose
of
the
patent
law,
main
purpose
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
to
encourage
inventive
efforts.
the
devotion
of
time
and
expenditure
to
invention
by
offering
a
reward,
the
right
to
exclude
all
others
from
making
using
or
selling
the
subject
matter
of
the
invention,
so
that
the
only
possible
impact
of
the
decision
of
ge
issue,
on
the
purpose
of
the
patent
statute,
would
be
that
if
it
--
it
would
be
enhancing
a
reward
and
thus
attraction
inventive
efforts
which
might
otherwise
would
not
take
place.
we
believe
that,
its'
quite
clear,
that
this
simply
does
not
exist.
for
one
thing,
and
i
wish
at
this
point
to
cast
no
reflections
of
the
patent
system,
we
do
not
really
know
if
the
patent
statute
itself
makes
a
net
contribution
to
the
flow
of
innovations.
we
know
that
much
research
would
go
on
without
the
patent
grant
because
of
competitive
pressures
and
because
people
are
motivated
by
reasons
other
than
pecuniary
as
professor
machlup,
who
studied
the
issue
about
as
much
as
anyone
has
said,
“none
of
the
empirical
evidence
at
our
disposal
and
none
of
the
theoretical
arguments
presented
either
confirms
or
confutes
the
belief
that
the
patent
system
has
promoted
the
progress
with
technical
arts.
no
economist
on
the
basis
of
present
knowledge
could
possibly
state
uncertainty
that
the
patent
system
as
it
now
operates,
confers
a
net
benefit
or
a
net
loss
on
the
society.
now,
setting
this
aside,
it
is
clear
that
whatever
the
reward,
it
is
that
the
patent
statute
confers,
the
right
to
insert
a
price
fixing
clause
in
a
license,
particularly,
if
this
is
limited
to
a
single
license
which
is
the
basis
on
which
appellees
proceed
here
is
of
marginal
value.
it
is
un
awfully
thin
slice
but
whatever
the
pie
is
and
it
is
of
marginal
value
even
after
the
patent
is
obtained
in
light
of
the
right
that
the
patentee
has
to
charge
any
royalty
up
to
what
the
patent
is
worth.
the
right
to
limit
the
number
--
and
the
right
to
limit
the
number
of
licensees
thus
minimizing
the
likelihood
of
vigorous
price
competition.
but
what
it
is
worth
after
the
fact
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
the
bearing
of
this
issue
on
the
patent
statute.
the
real
question
is,
to
what
extent
if
any,
is
it
considered
when
the
prospective
decision
by
the
inventor
or
the
corporation
as
the
case
maybe
is
made.
now,
here
it
seems
clear
that
a
company
contemplating
research
or
an
inventor
contemplating
individual
efforts
is
dealing
with
such
in-determinant
figures
that
such
a
marginal
aspect
of
the
patent
right
is
what
is
involved
here
could
not
have
any
decisive
influence.
in
important
respect,
what
the
patent
law
creates
is
something
like
a
lottery,
promising
rich
rewards
to
the
few
who
make
out,
in
this
respect
even
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
value
of
the
eventual
payoffs
or
maximum
payoffs,
would
make
no
difference.
to
use
a
simpler
example,
anyone
who
will
put
up
$1
to
win
a
$1,000
is
very
likely
to
put
up
the
same
dollar
to
win
500.
a
fortiori
to
win
975
which
is
my
example
is
probably
more
what
the
loss
of
the
right
to
price
fix
would
reflect.
therefore,
as
the
government's
view
and
we
believe
we
are
correct
again,
that
the
question
here
is
not
one
of
reconciling
patent
law
with
anti-trust
law
but
rather
whether
given
the
fact
that
the
patent
statute
gives
the
patentee
the
right
to
exclude
all
others.
the
right
to
price
fix
any
license
will
promote
anti-trust
policy
in
some
way.
now,
look
at
in
this
way,
and
we
believe
this
is
the
only
way
that
it
can
be
looked
at
reasonably.
the
ge
rule
is
a
wise
rule
only
if
all
of
the
following
propositions
are
true
or
probably
true.
first,
that
the
availability
of
the
right
to
insert
a
price
fixing
provision
in
a
license
induces
licensing
in
a
significant
number
of
cases
where
without
that
right,
licensing
would
not
take
place.
if
it
does
not
do
that,
it
makes
no
contribution
to
competition
under
any
circumstances
and
what
you
have
is
simply
a
gratuitous
restriction
that
must
represent
in
that
loss.
second,
even
if
it
induces
licensing
in
a
significant
number
of
cases,
we
must
believe
that
in
cases
where
it
is
so
induced,
licensing
will
more
often
than
not
over
the
long
run
produce
a
better
competitive
situation
and
if
licensing
had
not
taken
place,
an
issue
which
i
will
again
shortly
discuss.
third,
even
if
there
is
a
net
gain
in
this
respect,
we
must
believe
that
that
net
gain,
if
any
and
we
don't
think
there
is
any,
out
ways
the
economic
losses
that
result
on
price
restrictions
imposed
in
situations
where
licensing
would
have
taken
place
anyway,
and
the
economic
cost
to
society
of
the
elicit
use
of
price
fixing
for
cartel
purposes,
in
cases
which
it
imports
when
agencies
either
cannot
detect,
lack
the
resources
to
prosecute
or
able
to
terminate
only
or
after
the
arrangements
have
lasted
for
some
time.
it
is,
i
believe
which
we
hope
to
support
that
it
is
highly,
unlikely
that
these
prepositions
are
correct
that
whatever
reasoned
analysis
we
can
bring
to
bear
on
the
basis
of
present
knowledge,
suggest
to
the
contrary
that
the
ge
rule
does
more
harm
than
good.
but
that
in
any
event,
no
record
which
might
have
been
developed
in
this
case
would
have
been
any
material
help
in
shedding
light
on
those
propositions.
now,
first,
does
the
ge
rule
induce
licensing
in
a
significant
number
cases,
where
otherwise
no
licensing
would
take
place?
we
do
not
think
so,
but
we
do
not
pretend
to
know.
we
do
know
this?
in
many
cases,
patentees
have
not
and
would
not
license
even
with
the
opportunity
to
the
price
fix.
this
tendency
not
to
license,
in
fact,
appears
to
be
strongest
and
one
would
suppose
it
would
be
in
those
cases
which
perhaps
we
fear
the
most
when
we
talk
about
what
good
the
ge
rule
might
do.
namely,
the
case
where
the
patent
is
extraordinarily
strong
and
promises
to
the
patentee,
a
high
assurance
of
the
17
year
of
monopoly,
in
fact
with
nobody
coming
around
to
be
him.
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
this
connection
that
the
alcoa
case
often
cited
as
one
of
the
unfortunate
consequences
of
licensing
is
a
case
where
precisely
that
was
true.
despite
the
availability
of
the
right
to
put
a
price
fixing
clause
in
license
alcoa
never
licensed
anybody
in
the
hope
which
turned
out
to
be
well
founded
that
nobody
within
17
years
could
invent
around
them
and
that
they
would
have
established
in
almost
impregnable
monopoly
position.
now,
--
mr.
turner
they
did
license
during
the
war
mr.
justice.
i
believe
under
the
provisions
of
defense
legislation
and
thereafter
under
the
terms
of
the
decree
entered
by
the
district
court
in
the
alcoa
case
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
they
were
directed
to
license
then
existing
patents
to
their
competitors,
who
had
arisen
during
and
after
the
wars
as
a
result
of
sale
of
surplus
plans.
mr.
turner
that's
right.
their
original
basic
patent
the
one
which
they
never
did
licensed
are
collection
of
patents,
my
memory
is
not
too
clear
on
it,
go
way
back.
i
think
the
last
basic
patent
expired
somewhere
around
1915,
and
by
that
time
their
position
was
so
strong
that
they
in
effect
had
a
domestic
monopoly
until
the
post
war.
now,
how
about
those
cases
where
patentee
is
do
consider
licensing?
let
me
note
again,
the
value
of
the
right
to
put
in
price
fixing
clause
is
no
more
than
a
marginal
right.
whatever
the
value
is
can
be
converted
into
a
higher
royalty.
some
higher
royalty
would
measure
the
value
to
the
patentee,
and
the
right
is
decisive
to
the
patentee
or
decisively
influences
his
decision
to
license
only
when
he
translates
it
into
such
a
high
royalty
that
no
one
will
pay
it.
now,
if
ge
applies
only
to
a
single
license,
the
difference
between
price
fixing
and
the
protection
which
a
patentee
gets
from
a
higher
royalty
plus
a
considerable
confidence
that
only
two
producers
will
not
compete
very
vigorously
in
price,
a
common
industrial
phenomenon
is
very
small.
now,
whatever
maybe
said
for
this,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
in
this
case
and
in
all
other
cases
in
which
patentees
face
the
decision
whether
to
license
are
not,
there
are
many
other
potent
reasons
for
a
licensing
which
have
been
and
would
be
decisive
even
if
the
price
fixing
right
were
taken
away.
take
a
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
trial
judge
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
appeared
to
that
the
principal
reason
or
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
huck
license
(inaudible)
was
a
demand
by
huck's
customers
and
potential
customers
for
a
second
source.
in
order
to
minimize
shortages,
speed
deliveries
and
avoid
the
danger
that
labor
dispute
might
shut
down
the
only
supplier.
these
reasons
would
have
been
--
did
exist
and
would
exist
whether
the
price
fixing
right
were
present
or
not
and
they
are
a
powerful
inducement
to
a
company
like
huck
to
license.
secondly,
there
maybe
expanding
demand
or
excess
demand
which
can
be
met
more
quickly
by
licensing
other
producers
than
by
internal
expansion
of
facilities,
which
is
to
say
the
patentee
can
profit
more
quickly
and
at
a
greater
rate
by
licensing
rather
than
by
its
own
internal
expansion.
also,
licensing
gives
additional
income
without
having
to
make
capital
expenditures
and
thus
running
the
risk
of
heavy
capital
losses
in
the
event
of
declining
demand
in
the
future,
whether
because
the
commodity
is
no
longer
wanted
or
because
someone
has
invented
rounding
and
has
come
up
with
a
better
substitute.
let
me
repeat
the
point
the
enormous
advantage
of
any
patentee
in
licensing
is
that
he
does
not
risk
capital
losses.
now,
finally
there
are
some
reasons
which
again
we're
apparently
present
in
this
case
and
are
probably
in
almost
certain
present
in
all
cases
of
what
somewhat
last
repute
but
they
should
be
mentioned.
and
that
reason
is
that
the
would
be
licensee,
if
not
given
a
license
may
invent
around
the
patent
or
may
in
litigation
establish
the
invalidity
of
the
patent
or
lack
of
infringement,
so
the
patentee
will
have
a
competitor
with
no
royalty.
also,
that
the
licensee
may
slow
down
the
development
or
terminate
the
development
of
competing
goods,
if
he
has
the
protection
a
license.
in
short,
even
where
licensing
is
beneficial
or
neutral
as
in
the
case
of
expanding
or
excess
demand.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
most
cases
the
patentee
is
likely
to
license
without
price
fixing.
he's
still
retains
the
right
to
pick
his
licensee
carefully.
there's
little
likelihood
of
price
competition
in
a
situation
of
exist
or
expanding
demand
and
unless
the
cost
advantage
of
a
licensee
is
decisive
and
as
i
pointed
out,
he
can
avoid
that
by
picking
another
licensee,
all
of
the
reasons,
the
advantages
that
he
has
for
licensing
will
still
exist,
or
he
does
it
for
the
other
reasons
that
i
suggested
to
forestall
competitive
innovation,
to
forestall
litigation
which
maybe
fatal
to
his
patent
or
to
his
claim
of
infringement
that
those
reasons
may
still
compel
him
to
license
but
it
should
be
added
and
this
is
a
matter,
i
will
get
to
shortly
in
more
detail.
it's
quite
clear
there's
no
public
interest
in
encouraging
him
to
do
so.
summing
up,
looking
at
the
matter
as
best
as
we
can.
given
the
marginal
value
of
the
ge
rule
in
the
single
license
case
and
the
strong
reasons
for
licensing
anyway,
we
believe
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
best
guess
seems
clearly
to
be
that
the
ge
rule
will
induce
licensing
in
a
relatively
small
number
of
cases.
now,
would
we
know
any
more
about
this
if
the
issue
were
thrown
open
for
record
evidence?
we
think
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
the
question
raise
is
one
of
probabilities
which
if
answerable
at
all,
would
be
answerable
only
on
the
basis
of
careful
studies
of
a
statistically
significant
and
statistically
representative
number
of
cases.
no
such
studies
exist
and
it
seems
highly
unlikely
that
they
are
feasible
in
a
forceable
future.
i
think
we
might
get
a
good
inkling
as
to
this
later
point
by
asking
by
asking
the
question,
what
would
we
have
learn
in
this
case?
if
the
ge
rule
had
put
in
the
question
and
defendants
and
or
the
government
would
have
attempted
to
put
in
a
record.
i
presume
that
defendant
huck
would
have
testified
that
price
fixing
was
vital
to
the
decision,
although,
we
would
have
a
nice
dilemma
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
then
can
still
vigorously
resist
the
preposition,
if
there
was
any
such
agreement.
i
suppose
the
defendants
will
always
testify
to
this
fact.
but
such
testimony
is
clearly
worthless
unless
backed
up
by
objective
evidence
and
of
what
kind?
well,
here,
there
was
some
evidence
that
townsend
was
more
efficient
and
that
huck
feared
this
but
huck
might
still
have
relied
on
higher
royalty.
and
huck
clearly
had
many
reasons
for
licensing
which
i
have
already
recounted
which
appeared
in
the
record,
which
may
well
have
been
decisive.
indeed,
as
i
just
suggested
that
huck
vigorously
denies
that
any
price
fixing
agreement
existed
and
it
did
license.
and
the
district
court
appeared
to
find
that
it
did
so
for
reasons
wholly
apart
from
price
fixing
as
it
would
have
to
do.
now,
all
of
these
factors
are
present
in
this
case.
they
are
going
to
be
present
in
any
case
and
the
question
we
ask
is,
how
can
any
confident
judgment
be
reached
as
to
what
the
result
would
have
been
in
view
of
the
(inaudible)
and
non-quantifiable
nature
of
the
considerations
involved?
and
if
this
is
so,
for
the
individual
case,
how
could
any
economic
study
of
a
statistical
nature
of
any
value
ever
be
conducted?
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
second
--
mr.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
turner
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice.
it
is
the
question
of
reliance
is
an
important
one.
it
seems
to
us
that
to
the
extent
that
reliance
has
been
put
on
the
ge
rule,
despite
good
reasons
to
believe
that
it
has
not
been
the
solidest
of
precedents
that
this
could
be
taken
care
of
in
two
ways.
one
in
any
government
action,
the
government
could
as
it
has
here
simply
request
the
future
injunction
against
the
continuation
of
the
agreement
or
an
injunction
against
or
decree
that
the
clause
if
it's
in
the
contract,
it's
unlawful.
in
treble
damage
actions
when
and
if
such
cases
would
arise,
this
court
could
then
decide
whether
an
overruling
of
ge
should
or
should
not
be
given
prospective
effect
and
the
government
feels
it
would
be
very
appropriate
case
as
was
done
in
the
case
last
year
arising
out
of
knapp
v.
ohio
–-
would
be
a
very
appropriate
case
for
the
court
to
apply
the
ruling
only
prospectively.
that
would
take
care
of
that
problem.
mr.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
understand
the
question
was
whether
we
knew
how
many
people
had
relied?
mr.
turner
yes.
mr.
turner
that's
right.
which
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
deal
with
and
i
have
more
to
go.
mr.
turner
on
this
one,
i
don't
suppose
that
it
could
be
answered
mr.
chief
justice
because
a
lot
of
these
agreement,
we
don't
know
how
many
people
have
these
agreements
without
discovering
them
and
we
do
discover
them
from
time
to
time
and
almost
invariably
bring
suit.
but
i
don't
think
the
question
how
many
people
have
these
agreements
would
--
is
a
question
that
could
be
got
at.
we
would
be
no
better
off,
by
thinking
question
raised
below,
an
endeavor,
may
to
fond
out,
than
we
are
now.
people,
who
suspect
the
validity
of
any
such
agreement,
are
not
likely
broadcast
it,
and
how
many
unknown
agreements
there
are?
i
don't
think
i
know
and
i
don't
think
could
be
readily
discovered.
now,
i've
asked
the
question
whether
the
ge
rule
seems
likely
to
induce
people
to
license
in
any
significant
number
of
cases
where
the
otherwise
would
not.
but
i'd
like
to
go
to
the
question
which
is
also
essential
as
i
indicated
--
essential
support
to
ge
and
that
in
cases
where
price
fixing
does
induce
licensing,
will
the
situation
more
often
than
not
be
better
then
if
the
patentee
deprived
of
the
right
to
put
in
a
price
fixing
clause
didn't
license
at
all?
now,
we
know
to
say
the
least
that
licensing
will
not
always
produce
a
better
situation.
for
reasons
that
were
set
forth
in
the
court's
opinion
in
masonite
and
concurring
opinion
in
line
material
and
fears
then
expressed
by
the
court
which
really
materialize
in
this
case
here,
and
will
always
be
present,
namely
that
the
patentee
may
license
simply
to
forestall
competition
which
might
otherwise
develop.
now,
licensing
is
most
likely
to
be
beneficial,
as
i
believe,
i
mentioned
before
in
a
case
of
strong
patent
promising
a
17
year
monopoly
or
more
but
these
are
rare
and
as
i
mentioned
before
where
such
a
situation
exists,
the
patentees
are
simply
not
likely
to
license
anyway.
so,
price
fixing
is
most
likely
to
be
utilized
where
the
patents
are
weak,
less
basic,
and
here
there
is
a
less
to
be
gained
from
licensing
and
less
to
be
lost
from
no
licensing.
now,
whatever
assessment
is
made,
i
have
not
covered
all
of
the
considerations
and
i
probably
haven't.
here,
again,
i
submit
that
no
record
would
help,
look
again
at
this
case
and
ask
yourself
if
it
would
really
have
been
possible
in
any
decisive
or
even
barely
satisfactory
way
to
answer
the
question
whether
it
would've
been
better
in
the
long
run
if
huck
had
not
licensed
or
whether
as
it
did
to,
it
did
licensed.
we
have
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
form
of
fears
expressed
that
townsend,
if
not
given
a
license
couldn't
be
in
around
the
huck's
patent
or
beat
it
in
litigation.
now,
perhaps
more
light
could
be
shed
on
this
issues
on
what
might
have
happened
if
there
had
been
a
full
range
of
testimony
on
the
validity
of
the
patent,
and
the
likelihood
in
the
light
of
the
full
range
of
the
patent
that
are
in
the
field
that
research
would
produce
a
substantive.
but
these
issues
are
difficult
at
best
and
again,
an
answer
in
anyone
case
gives
no
answer
whatsoever
to
probabilities
which
is
the
critical
question.
now,
finally
does
the
net
gain
so
far
and
we
believe
if
you
had
to
make
an
estimate,
that
there's
a
net
loss
so
far,
from
the
ge
rule,
out
way
the
cost
of
permitting
price
fixing
by
any
per
se
rule
of
per
se
legality
in
situations
where
licensing
would've
occurred
anyway
and
that
therefore
the
price
fixing
right
is
at
risk
gratuitous
and
added
restriction
serving
no
purpose
at
all.
and
in
those
cases
and
we
know
that
these
exist,
pages
of
this
court
in
past
where
the
license
is
taken
not
so
much
for
the
patent
but
for
the
price
fixing,
and
for
the
advantage
that
is
gained
by
cementing
an
anti-competitive
arrangement.
mr.
turner
yes,
sir.
i
can't
recount
all
the
instances
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
government
from
time
to
time
over
the
years
has
endeavored
to
overrule
ge
by
statute.
mr.
turner
without
success.
though
further
on
the
point,
i
would
suggest
that
this
should
not
be
of
any
great
influence,
the
ge
rule
as
the
court
made
the
rule
legislation
in
this
area,
the
whole
anti-trust
area
either
way,
it
just
doesn't
happen
very
often.
what
we
have
in
anti-trust
statute,
what
we
have
in
patent
statute
is
something
is
very
hard
to
mount
sufficient
alignment
political
forces
to
get
change
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
the
--
in
this
connection
that
the
failure
of
congress
to
overrule
the
ge
does
not
necessarily
represent
a
positive
judgment
–-
mr.
turner
--
that
should
not.
yes?
mr.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
turner
yes,
sir,
it
is.
unless
one
supposes
which
--
unless
one
takes
the
approach
it
was
taken
in
the
motion
picture
patent’s
case
that
really
all
restrictions
beyond
the
bare
terms
of
the
patent
grant
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
or
simply
beyond
the
scope
of
the
patent
grand
and
would
be
treated
under
ordinary
general
law
but
that
too,
i
suppose
is
a
judge
made
law,
that's
what
i
mean
by
it.
but
certainly,
let
me
put
it
this
way
that
the
general
electric
is
certainly
not
compelled
by
reading
the
patents.
mr.
turner
no.
i
mean
in
this
sense
though
that
the
ge
rule
is
certainly
not
compelled
by
the
terms
of
the
patent
statute
if
anything,
the
information
would
be
to
say
otherwise
and
it
is
judge-made
in
the
sense,
i
suppose
that
any
issues
statutory
interpretation
as
judge
made
that
is
an
area
where
there
is
a
reasonable
cause
for
dispute.
mr.
turner
yes,
in
the
sense.
well,
mr.
justice
white
i
suppose
in
the
sense
all
anti-trust
laws
is
judge
made.
mr.
turner
yes.
mr.
turner
i
--
mr.
turner
i
don't
know
whether
to
pursue
that
any
further
i
don't
know
where
it
takes
me.
mr.
turner
mr.
justice,
there
are
lot
of
things
i
don't
know
in
tax
cases
or
whatever.
mr.
turner
now,
i
have
come
as
i
indicated
the
final
question
as
to
whether
there
any
net
gain
in
the
ge
rule
in
terms
what
we
knew.
we
believe
that
again
the
probabilities
are
as
best
we
can
speculate
that
the
losses
exceed
the
gains
but
again
we
would
insist
and
i
don't
think
i
have
to
labor
the
point
now
that
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
any
record
would
provide
any
further
enlightenment
upon
this.
no
decisive
proof
could
be
ever
being
gotten
without
a
full
survey,
all
instances
in
which
licensing
has
occurred,
what
would
have
happened
if
had
not
occurred,
instances,
where
price
fixing
was
gratuitous
and
as
and
we
suggest
that
such
information
is
simply
not
available.
now,
i
would
like
before
concluding
on
this
to
deal
specifically
with
one
of
the
points
raised
by
appellees
and
that
is
the
suggestion
and
it
is
certainly
a
possibility
that
the
removal
of
the
protection
afforded
by
the
ge
rule
might
conceivably
produce
concentration
or
add
the
concentration
in
some
industries
by
causing
a
small
producer,
who
would
otherwise
stay
in
business
to
sell
out.
now,
as
i
say
this
is
a
possibility
but
i
would
like
to
examine
the
question
whether
it
is
anything
worth
pausing
over
one.
first
point,
i
would
make
is
that
a
higher
royalty
will
connect
to
small
producer
in
every
case
where
the
value
of
this
patent
as
measured
by
what
the
licensee
is
prepared
to
pay
exceeds
the
cost
disadvantage
that
the
patentee
operates
under.
whereas
this
is
not
so,
the
patentee
may
license
a
less
efficient
producer,
he
may
license
no
one,
or
he
may
indeed
sell
out
his
patent
to
the
more
efficient
producer
or
someone
else.
now,
how
can
we
asses
the
consequences
of
this?
if
he
licensees
to
a
less
efficient
producer,
the
public
in
terms
of
the
price
that
it
pays
will
lose
nothing
because
the
price
would
presumably
if
it
is
set
by
anyway.
if
he
licenses
no
one
for
such
time
as
his
inefficiency
lasts,
there
is
indeed
a
temporary
loss
of
output
which
might
otherwise
have
been
produced.
if
he
never
does
become
more
efficient,
it
is
common
guard
in
variety
anti-trust
law
that
he
probably
ought
to
go
out
of
business.
and
if
he
does
sell
out
to
the
more
efficient
producer
that
too
has
much
to
recommend
it,
at
least
the
public
gets
the
benefit
of
lower
prices
and
resources
are
being
utilized
by
those
best
to
able
to
utilize
them.
moreover,
to
the
extent
that
patent
accumulations
are
purchase
of
patents
by
normal
--
counter
company
is
a
problem,
we
have
perfectly
adequate
ways
of
dealing
with
this
under
the
anti-trust
laws.
i've
raised
an
issue
which
this
court
has
not
decided
but
i
can
suggest
what
the
government's
position
would
clearly
be
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
applying
to
the
acquisition
or
all
of
any
or
any
of
the
part
of
the
assets
of
a
company
includes
within
this
comprehension
patents.
and
if
the
government
has
a
good
cause
of
action
under
section
7,
if
a
dominant
firm
in
an
industry
acquires
patents
which
further
its
dominance.
so
in
short,
any
serious
consequences
resulting
from
this
seem
to
us
to
see
the
controllable
in
other
and
more
satisfactory
ways.
now,
let
me
try
to
conclude
on
the
merits
as
we
see
them,
the
court
has
three
choices,
a
case
by
case
approach
to
the
issue
raised
here,
a
rule
like
ge
that
a
single
license
price
fixing
clause
is
a
per
se
lawful
and
third
position
we
defend
that
should
be
held
unlawful
per
se.
mr.
turner
this
way
is
around
a
difficult
problem,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
we
would
have
to
say
that
faced
with
a
choice
between
allowing
ge
to
reply
to
a
wide
number
of
licenses,
to
plurality
of
licenses
and
to
a
single
license
only,
we
would
have
to
accept
the
latter.
but
this
is
a
difficult
question
because
if
the
ge
rational
is
correct
the
single
license
rule
cuts
before
it.
and
the
issue
--
and
the
case
in
which
we're
most
worried
namely
that
of
monopoly,
obviously,
if
there's
advantage
to
be
gained
in
preserving
a
competitive
structure.
that
advantage
is
multiplied
by
multiple
licensing.
there's
also
an
issue
of
equity
involved.
i
mean,
if
you
would
affect
in
the
patent
case
if
as
we
doubt
the
patentee
is
going
to
license
anybody.
you
condemn
to
death
those
licensees
who
can't
get
the
patent,
so
it's
a
very
troublesome
issue.
mr.
turner
it
--
it
did
insofar
as
price
fixing
is
concerned.
in
fact,
there
were
some
licenses
to
smaller
companies
--
mr.
turner
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
turner
that's
right.
now,
--
mr.
turner
it's
by
on
means
clear,
i
mean,
there's
still
dispute
and
each
one
of
those
limitations
raise
a
serious
questions.
a
good
case
can
be
made
in
theory
for
the
proposition
that
the
ge
rule
is
sound,
it
ought
to
extend
not
only
to
controlling
the
price
of
an
end
product,
but
to
controlling
the
price
of
an
unpatented
end
product
in
which
the
patented
component
is
very
important.
again,
if
there
is
any
merit
in
rule.
in
theory,
it
would
extend.
now,
let
me
again
hasten
to
saying
that
if
the
government
would
never
be
caught
supporting
that
proposition,
but
the
tendency
of
the
decisions
has
been
debarked
to
rule
in.
we
believe
very
simply
that
and
we
don't
think
on
this
the
appellees
would
disagree
that
a
case
by
case
rule
makes
no
sense
at
all
but
you
subject
in
effect,
there's
no
law
at
all
because
the
issues
are
so
indetermined.
and
in
light
of
what
we
know,
in
light
of
the
inability
really
to
get
any
significant
further
information
by
virtue
of
a
record
that
here
the
presumption
should
clearly
be
in
favor
against
a
restriction
so
anti-competitive
in
nature.
once
the
issue
has
gotten
in
anti-trust
context,
once
it
is
realized
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
accommodating
the
patent
statute
and
its
strictly
anti-trust
question,
we
believe
the
answer
should
be
cleared.
mr.
turner
i
think
--
i
do
not
know
for
sure
mr.
justice
because
i
don't
know
the
private
cases.
to
the
best
of
knowledge,
there
is
no
government
case
currently
pending
that
involves
the
rule.
now,
there's
one
other
issue
the
government
has
urged
that
the
--
even
if
ge
hasn't
overruled
that
a
combination
in
an
exclusive
license
and
price
fixing
should
be
held
beyond
the
scope
of
ge.
i
treat
this
issue
with
considerably
less
enthusiasm.
i
think
it
is
what
it
leaves
of
the
ge
rule
is
very
little.
if
the
position
has
a
merit
i
think
the
merit
is
in
terms
of
the
arguments
that
i
just
made
namely
that
the
case
for
ge
is
so
painfully
weak
that
it
ought
in
any
of
that
to
be
restricted
as
narrowly
as
possible.
therefore,
we
urge
that
the
case
be
reversed.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
have
time
to
get
back
on
this
matter.
