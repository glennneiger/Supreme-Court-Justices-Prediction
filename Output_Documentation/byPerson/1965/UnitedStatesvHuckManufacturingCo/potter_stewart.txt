justice
potter
stewart
that
there
should
be
license
with
nobody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
in
other
words
we
do
have
to
proceed
on
the
premise
that
that
was
--
what
was
represented
to
the
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
mr.
turner,
it's
clear
isn't
it
--
if
the
court
should
agree
with
you
today,
the
case
would
be
remanded.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
turner,
to
word
or
not
anything
that
there's
such
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
--
hypothesis?
justice
potter
stewart
you
rule
out
the
choice
that
more
than
a
single
price
--
more
than
the
price
fixing
with
the
single
licensee
is
open
to
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
ge
itself
involved
in
the
single
licensee,
did
it
not,
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
issue
it
would
involved
--?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
case
involves
at
least
according
to
your
theory
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
exclusive
license?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
that
the
as
i
understand
to
your
brief
and
your
argument
the
law
and
the
federal
court
--
the
other
federal
court
has
been
pretty
clear
in
whitening
down
the
ge
rule
to
the
single
licensing?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
looker
didn't
testify
in
this
case?
but
all
he
only
had
was
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
you
had
no
live
witness
in
this
case,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
any
findings
of
the
facts
were
just
based
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
can
have
price
fixing
as
a
second
source?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
that
kind
of
evidence
was
before
the
court,
and
it
decided
the
general
electric
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
right,
i
mean,--
if
it's
waived
then
it's
waived
though
it
doesn't
make
any
deference
about
the
record.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
is
--
if
there's
no
record,
it
doesn't
make
much
deference
even
if
the
government
has
it
waived
that's
right.
what
about
â€“
we
might
agree
with
you
as
was
the
record
made
but
agree
with
them,
if
they
haven't
waived
it,
which
of
that
i
suppose,
there
would
be
remand
do
make
a
record
on
the
ge
point.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
not
be
--
you're
not
stuck
with
that
choice
in
the
event
that
we
accept
the
government's
position
of
this
case.
are
you
--
the
whole
trial
would
start
again
and
surely
that
the
stipulation
or
agreement
whatever
it
was
would
go
right
out
the
window,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
will
not
solve
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
union
oil
case
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
still
little
puzzled,
more
than
a
little
puzzled
as
to
what
the
nature
of
that
evidence
would
be?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
i
suppose
would
have
to
be
coupled
with
testimony
either
from
mr.
huck
or
somebody
else
that
the
only
--
that
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
license
without
price
fixing,
that
i
would
have
to
follow.
in
other
words,
the
second
source
could
not
have
been
provided,
or
would
not
have
been
provided
without
price
fixing.
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
price
fixing
is
a
very
good
thing
and
i'm
sure
you
get
that
to
a
lot
businessman
and
lot
of
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
there
would
have
to
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
including
the
exclusivity
with
the
real
time?
justice
potter
stewart
both
aspects.
justice
potter
stewart
more
extended
for
the
life
of
the
patent?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
found
as
to
be
the
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
true?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
want
to
waste
your
time
and
i'm
asking
you
the
information.
justice
potter
stewart
--
information,
the
way
the
case
was
tried
below,
of
course,
as
i
understand
was
the
government's
theory
that
this
agreement
not
to
license
anybody
else
went
beyond
general
electric
and
for
that
reason
is
not
covered
by
any
other.
now,
the
court
holding
in
your
favor
must
have
done
so
either
by
just
disbelieving
looker
and
therefore
holding,
if
there
was
no
such
side
agreement
or
b
that
there
was
one
or
even
if
there
was
one,
still
it
was
covered
by
general
electric
in
which
did
the
court
do.
