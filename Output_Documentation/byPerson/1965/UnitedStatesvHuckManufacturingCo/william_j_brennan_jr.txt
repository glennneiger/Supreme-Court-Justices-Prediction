justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
quite
hear
mr.
turner
what
you
said
about
the
--
what
disagreement
was
about
the
exclusivity
of
townsend's
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
side
of
the
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
took
a
same
position
in
the
criminal
side
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
a
profile
on
the
factual
issue
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
about
that
mr.
turner
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
long
this
patent
had
to
run?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
been
after
a
law
suit
(inaudible)
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
discover
you
didn't
do
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
this
case
decided
that
we
all
will
be
moving?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
have
one
case
now
i
wonder
if
it
has
any
bearing
and
whether
we
ought
to
reach
the
question
in
light
of
these
strains
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
turner,
you
say
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
is
ge
is
a
judge
maybe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assuming
the
judge
made
in
the
sense
to
the
rule
of
charitable
immunity
is
â€“
likely
as
the
judge
may
rule
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
on
exclusive
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
section
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
argument
i
don't
understand
because
the
case
has
been
tried
is
it?
when
take
this
--
if
we
should
agree
with
the
government,
the
first
year
to
go
back,
then
for
trial,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see,
and
maybe
that's
not
quite
my
point,
excuse
me,
point
of
view
but
what
kind
of
a
--
i
don't
see
the
piece
can
be
anything
beyond
the
speculative
assertions,
in
any
event,
what
kind
of
a
factual
record
could
you
have
built?
what
kind
of
the
price
suppose
had
the
testimony
of
the
economist,
maybe
some
statistics
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
the
type
of
thing
that
we
usually
do
in
the
antitrust
case
--
you
don't
--
on
the
bank
case,
we
don't
ask
for
advice
of
people
on
how
they
think
that
should
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
price
fixing
they
don't
ask
the
views
on
others
good
or
bad.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
more
than
price
fixing
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
if
we
agreed
with
government
on
the
general
motors,
it
should
be
overruled
--
everything
would
go
back
for
a
trial.
i'm
getting
at
the
point
of
the
prejudice
that
--
you
may
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
client
instantly
would
agree
with
government
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule
of
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
all
that
if
we
didn't
--
those
parts
per
se,
i
thought
mr.
turner
suggested
there
were
alternatives,
he
recognized
and
he
did
not
have
to
go
as
far
the
per
se
rule
necessarily
existed,
and
if
we
didn't
and
we
did
not
would
all
these
become
relevant
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
case
by
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
are
not
presently
fixing
prices?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
could
present
that
evidence
in
order
to
avoid
the
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
get
a
trial
although
when
you
went
back
if
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be
within
our
competence
to
send
it
back
to
a
trial
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
read
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
read
the
record
in
that
case,
the
court
merely
took
judicial
notice
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
what
is
done
here?
what's
the
bearing
of
--
you
said
this
patent
on
its
copy
is
together?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
should
not
be
any
short
proceeding,
i
gather?
