they
had
three
as
i
remember
that
it
would
adhere
strictly
to
general
electric
in
my
material
witness,
before
the
court?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
a
report
to
senate
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
at
the
time
that
you
try
this
case
but
two
of
your
dissenters
of
the
court
had
passed
on?
justice
tom
c.
clark
there's
only
two
left
here.
i
suppose,
you
see
how
it
used
to
be
done
there,
and
figure
out
these
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
thank
you.
