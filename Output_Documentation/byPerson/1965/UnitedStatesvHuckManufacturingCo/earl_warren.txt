mr.
turner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
consistent
--
is
that
consistent
with
your
position
here
today?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
i
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
as
your
--
is
your
approach
to
this
case
for
the
purpose
of
overruling
general
electric
are
they
consistent
with
that
representation
that
you
made
to
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
do
--
why
are
we
proposed
to
withhold
with
a
situation
where
you
say
one
thing
to
the
trial
court
in
order
to
get
a
judgment
and
come
here
and
say
the
opposite?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
what?
i
can't
hear
you.
would
you
speak
up
a
little
louder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
speak
up
a
little
louder,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
i
wasn't
questioning
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
isn't
a
question
of
failing
to
--
failing
to
present
the
matter
before
but
you
have
just
read
us
that
portion
of
the
order
which
says
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
government
stated
that
it
is
not
attempting
to
have
the
doctrine
set
in
the
general
electric
case
overruled
and
stated
only
the
facts
in
this
case
do
not
fall
within
that
doctrine.
that
the
doctrine
is
still
good
law
but
as
not
applied
as
the
actions
in
this
case
are
really
doing
so
forth.
that
isn't
just
question
of
not
raising,
it
isn't
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
misleading
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
can
answer
that
question,
does
that
indicate
that
we
should
have
the
guidance
of
the
court
below
in
exploring
that
matter
before
it
comes
to
us
as
a
matter
of
first
impression?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
one
perhaps
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
just
one
passes
of
it.
there
are
others
too,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
least
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
case?
