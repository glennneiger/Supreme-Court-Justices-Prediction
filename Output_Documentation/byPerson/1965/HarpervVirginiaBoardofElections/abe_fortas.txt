justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
that
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
mr.
brown
that
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
has
conceded
that
the
appellants
here
are
paupers?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gibson,
i
take
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
take
it
then
that
you
do
agree
that
there
are
some
restrictions
upon
the
right
of
the
states
to
prescribe
the
qualifications
of
voters,
if
that
is
not
an
unqualified
unrestricted
right.
justice
abe
fortas
then
what
is
not
true?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
restrictions
in
your
view
that
permissible
--
the
restrictions
on
the
right
of
the
state
to
prescribe
the
qualifications
of
voters
are
restrictions
that
confined
the
strength
to
qualifications
of
a
rational
in
the
sense
that
paying
relate
to
the
right
to
vote,
is
that
what
you're
--
what
i'm
trying
to
understand
from
your
last
remark.
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
like
(voice
overlap)
i'd
appreciate
knowing
your
view
of
it
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
taking
into
account
that
principle
as
well
as
the
specific
language
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
if
the
state
said
that
no
negro
shall
be
qualified
to
vote,
would
you
--
would
your
view
be
that
that
would
be
an
unreasonable,
unlawful,
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
state's
right
to
prescribe
the
qualifications
of
voters?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
i
tried
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
my
effort
against
clear
view
of
your
theory
would
if
you
were
at
least
forget
about
fifteenth
amendment.
in
the
absence
of
the
fifteenth
amendment's
expressed
provision,
how
would
you
feel
about
that
as
to
whether
the
state
has
the
right
to
prescribe
such
qualification
for
voting?
justice
abe
fortas
no
negroes
may
vote.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
so
it
is
your
view
that
putting
aside
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
rather
in
the
constitution
that
would
prevent
a
state
from
prohibiting
negroes
from
voting.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
equal
protection
clause,
fourteenth
amendment
as
applied
to
that
situation,
what's
your
view
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
you
do
not
--
if
i
understand
your
position
then,
you
do
not
regard
the
right
to
vote
as
within
any
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
either
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
our
cases
under
242
that
deal
with
the
--
their
reconstruction
statutes,
that
deal
with
the
forceful
interference
with
the
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gibson,
may
i
ask
you
whether
in
virginia,
they
hold
elections
for
federal
office
and
for
state
office
at
some
times
on
the
same
day.
in
other
words,
are
there
years
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
does
that
work
now?
does
the
person
come
to
the
poll
and
he
gets
a
ballot,
i
suppose
that
he
hasn't
paid
his
poll
tax.
he
gets
a
ballot.
the
federal
ballots
but
not
state
ballots,
so
that
he'll
go
into
the
voting
booth
about
--
if
the
man
has
not
paid
his
poll
tax,
he'll
go
into
the
voting
booth
with
just
the
federal
ballot
and
somebody
who
has
paid
his
$1.50
or
is
exempt
under
these
various
provisions
would
go
into
the
voting
booth
next
door
with
the
--
both
ballots,
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
supposed
they
were
proved,
mr.
gibson,
i
suppose
we
have
before
us
the
record
that
proved
just
to
accept
that
premise
that
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
the
particular
tax
were
to
abridge
the
right
of
senators
to
vote
on
account
of
color
or
race.would
that
come
within
the
language
of
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
so
that
your
position
now
is
that
the
effect
of
the
poll
tax
has
not
been
demonstrated
to
be
--
to
abridge
the
right
of
persons
or
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
this
state
of
the
record
in
the
number
655,
butts
and
the
counsel,
mr.
segar
described
that
correctly?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
yes
but
the
issues
that
you
and
i
are
discussing
leaves
there
as
whether
the
effect
of
the
poll
tax
is
to
abridge
the
right
of
citizens
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
and
mr.
segar's
table
would
indicate
to
me,
right
in
the
record
in
that
case
here,
mr.
segar's
statement
would
indicate
for
me
that
there
is
some
evidence
for
his
work
that
that
is
the
effect
of
the
virginia
poll
tax.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
charge
the
people
million
dollars
to
vote
that
the
effect
of
that
would
be
economic
and
it
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it
also
might
deprive
some
people
the
right
to
vote.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
it
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
sustain
the
validity
of
the
virginia
polling
--
poll
tax
limited
to
$1.50,
but
on
the
contrary,
it
makes
it
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
the
poll
tax,
would
be
not
thereby
be
sustaining
a
principle
that
the
poll
tax
may
be
leveled
as
a
condition
to
voting
without
limitation
as
to
amount?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
reason
when
i
asked
you
that
question
is
that
i
understood
from
your
argument
yesterday
that
it
was
your
theory
that
the
state
power,
they
would
fix
the
qualifications
of
voters
is
not
limited
by
questions
of
reasonableness
or
any
other
questions.
i
like
to
inquire
this
morning
is
really
whether
you
think
consistently
with
your
view
on
this
matter
that
the
state
power
to
levy
a
poll
tax
as
a
prerequisite
for
voting
is
limited
by
the
reasonableness
of
the
amount.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gibson,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
that
it's
quite
important
for
me
to
understand
whether
it's
your
position
that
the
states
have
the
absolute
and
unqualified
power
free
from
many
restraint
or
restraining
ruling
by
this
court
to
fix
the
qualifications
of
voters
except
as
incorporated
in
the
constitutional
amendment
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
purposes.
that's
--
and
that's
why
i
asked
you
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
question
that
i
did
and
it's
important
for
me
to
know
whether
you
believe
that
isn't
unqualified
and
unqualifiable
power
of
the
state
or
whether
it
is
subject
to
reasonable
patience.
yesterday,
i
thought
you
will
argue
that
the
power
absolute
and
this
morning
i
can't
feel
it
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
yesterday.
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
state
could
provide
that
only
red-haired
people
may
vote,
to
take
another
absurd
illustration
just
clarify
the
theory.
justice
abe
fortas
it
does
and
i
thank
you
very
much.
as
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
an
alternative
--
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
