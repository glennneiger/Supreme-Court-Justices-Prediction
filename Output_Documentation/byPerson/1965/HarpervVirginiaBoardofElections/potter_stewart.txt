presumably
is
that
i
suppose
to
take
care
of
the
fact
that
they
would
not
have
had
time
to
get
back
and
pay
the
tax,
is
that
it?

what
age

justice

stewart
well,
that's
--
maybe
you
and
maybe
i
think
it's
not
wise,
but
certainly,
you
can
conceive
i'm
sure
of
a
point
of
view
that
the
state
might
have
that
would
motivate
them
in
wanting
to
have
voters
vote
only
voters
vote
who
voted
responsibly.

and
historically,
there's
a
very
great
deal
of
--
there
are
many
qualifications
involving
ownership
of
property
and
that
too
reflects
that
kind
of
an
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
state.
they
wanted
people
with
a

with

with
a
stake

now,
that
is
perhaps
a
theory
but
i
suggest
that
there
is
at
least
one
other
theory
just
to
rationally
support
it.
and
this
reflects
that
same
kind
of
a
--
of
a
theory,
is
it
not?
justice

stewart
well,
how
about
a
driver's
license
which
cost
$2
a
year?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
(voice
overlap)
you're
not
saying
the
tax
is
bad
but
you
are
saying
--
but
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
bad
for
a
state
to
prevent
a
person
from
driving
unless
he
got
a
license
because
the
--
such
a
tax
would
bear
more
heavily
upon
