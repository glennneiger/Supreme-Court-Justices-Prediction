mr.
george
d.
gibson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
cases
that
have
been
presented
for
appellants
and
of
course
--
it
is
a
fortunate
advocate
who
can
speak
with
the
favoring
type
of
opinion.
we
agreed
that
the
enlargement
of
opportunity
in
the
largest
sense
is
one
of
the
historical
goals
of
our
society.
and
virginia
has
been
known
to
make
some
contribution
in
that
regard
and
we'll
do
so.
we
appear
here
not
in
opposition
to
those
aspirations
would
only
to
see
that
they'd
be
accomplished
through
lawful
means.
the
court
no
doubt
is
concerned
in
seeing
that
the
government
--
business
of
government
have
conducted
within
constitutional
limitations
with
the
maxim
that
every
man
is
created
free
and
equal.
but
individual
freedom
is
not
likely
to
survive
unless
the
court
also
respects
the
federalist
principle
which
was
the
great
means
by
which
a
union
of
many
states
was
formed
and
has
been
maintained
despite
these
trends
and
changes.
yet
that
is
the
very
principle
that
at
bottom.
the
object
of
attack
in
these
cases
and
what
is
--
i
throw
one
of
the
few
vested
jury
rights
of
the
states
and
one
of
the
most
delicate
and
sensitive
areas
of
local
government,
the
rights
to
suffrage.
those
circumstances
reinforced
a
judicial
responsibility
to
where
the
particulars
of
the
poll
tax
here
in
issue
against
the
specific
words
and
history
of
the
constitutional
provisions
that
are
invoked
against
it.
the
cases
are
simple.
they
are
very
well
summarized
and
fairly
stated
by
counsel
for
appellant.
with
regards
to
poll
tax
itself,
i
think
only
one
additional
comment
may
be
made
to
being
the
law
clearly
before
your
honors.
and
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
poll
tax
if
you
pay
$1.50
in
each
year
by
december
5.
there's
no
such
a
case
for
citizens
to
make
astronomical
predictions
of
future
election
dates
and
govern
their
conduct
accordingly.
december
5
is
the
annual
payment
date
and
that's
all
it
says
in
the
act.
the
presentation
or
oral
argument
--
i
mean,
may
i
add
to
some
statement
of
facts
that
mr.
justice
black
may
have
a
comparative
approaching
with
complete
serenity
the
constitutional
issues
here
involve
because
of
the
virtual
absence
of
any
evidence
whatever
in
the
record
only
a
few
statistics
from
census.
the
oral
arguments
had
had
this
advantage
of
simplifying
the
issues
surprisingly
in
part
for
the
court
to
consider.
at
this
phase,
my
learned
brother
brown
admits
that
breedlove
against
suttles
is
controlling.
and
that
he
cannot
prevail
unless
it's
overruled.
the
next
phase
by
distinguished
made
by
the
solicitor
general
virtually
abandoned
the
argument
he's
emphasized
so
much
in
this,
but
this
time
on
the
added
history,
that
voting
rights
derived
from
the
first
amendment,
alluding
to
any
argument
but
without
any
consistency.
and
finally,
my
brother
segar
admits
that
the
purpose
from
legislation
the
motive
inspiring
it
64
years
ago
is
not
determination,
but
rather
the
objective,
factual
operation
of
the
law.
actually,
the
case
presented
by
appellants
involves
as
my
brother
segar's
argument
so
well
emphasizes
an
importance,
an
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
certain
political
rights.
for
instance,
bridget
is
relied
on
as
virtually
dispositive
where
the
court
gave
such
emphasis
to
the
right
of
appeal
in
criminal
prosecutions,
the
case
obviously
involving
a
deprivation
or
potential
deprivation
of
liberty
of
a
person
contrary
to
the
constitutional
requirement.
the
solicitor
general
has
with
the
eloquent
discussions
by
him
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
political
rights
of
expression
at
the
ballot
box
without
bothering,
however,
to
identify
before
the
court
exactly
the
origin
of
the
right
he
has
emphasized.
so
if
the
court
would
permit,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
those
constitutional
provisions
that
seems
to
us
dispositive.
i
find
the
declaration
of
independence
or
--
more
realistically
upon
its
vindication
by
virtually
in
combat.
the
thirteenth
colonies,
and
has
became
13
sovereign
states
with
the
full
panoply
of
rights
associated
with
that
status
including
most
naturally
and
necessarily
the
right
to
determine
the
qualifications
for
suffrage.
that
existed
throughout
the
period
of
the
confederation
until
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
in
1788.
if
anything
can
be
accepted
as
a
certainty,
it's
this,
that
in
adopting
the
constitution
in
1788,
no
colonial
state
imagines
for
a
moment,
that
it
was
thereby
relinquishing
its
sovereign
authority
to
establish
the
qualifications,
the
suffrage
in
his
own
local
elections.
quite
to
the
contrary,
they
provided
it
even
in
the
election
of
representatives
of
the
larger
house
in
congress,
house
of
representatives,
that
the
qualifications
of
elector
should
be
those
determined
by
the
states
before
the
members
of
the
larger
house
of
the
state
legislature.
clearly,
it's
left
with
each
day
its
sovereign
power
to
determine
the
qualifications
in
its
own
election
and
adapt
to
them
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
for
election
of
congressmen.
indeed
had
any
other
provision
that's
been
put
in
the
proposed
management
perfectly
obvious
it
was
never
have
been
accepted
by
the
states.
now,
exactly
the
same
policy
both
in
substance
and
in
expression
was
reiterated
in
1913
when
the
election
of
senators
was
transferred
from
the
states
to
the
people.
and
here
again,
the
choice
was
not
given
to
all
the
people
nor
where
a
specific
qualifications
the
particular
people
enunciated.
on
the
contrary,
the
identical
language
of
the
original
instrument
wasn't
here.
the
electors
in
each
state
shall
have
the
qualifications
requisite
for
election
to
the
members
of
the
most
--
innermost
branch
of
the
state
legislatures.
in
conclusion,
on
that
one
point,
the
determination
of
voter
qualifications
is
exclusively
a
matter
of
state
concern
and
it's
to
be
exercised
by
the
state
alone
as
they
may
wish
unless
their
particular
conduct
in
a
particular
situation
infringes
upon
some
other
constitutional
inhibition.
now,
passing
over
the
guarantee
of
a
republican
form
of
government
as
intrinsically
too
vague
and
that
even
--
that's
for
implementation
because
of
the
infirmities,
we
must
look
to
the
amendments
and
by
these
points
stressed
so
by
my
brother
segar,
i'm
sure
that
his
position
is
that
the
right
of
suffrage
is
not
a
first
amendment
right.
we
have
told
on
brief
that
the
first
--
the
freedom
of
speech
is
a
meaningless
set
of
word,
a
master
keystone
of
the
arch
is
supplied
by
the
right
to
cast
a
ballot.
and
we're
about
to
admire
the
novelty
of
that
suggestion.
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
reject
it
for
three
reasons.
and
this
says,
if
the
first
amendment
had
been
designed
“a
comprehensive
charter
or
political
freedom
and
the
right
to
vote
is
the
supreme
expression
of
political
freedom,
it
would
have
then
mentioned,
indeed
mentioned
first
of
all,
when
point
in
fact,
it
is
not
mentioned
at
all.”
and
then
this
is
perfectly
clearly
understood
concept,
every
constitution
adopted
in
1776
which
were
five
specified
freedom
of
speech
as
one
of
the
retained
rights
of
people.
they
were
virginia,
pennsylvania,
delaware,
maryland,
and
north
carolina.
and
incidentally,
it
was
demanded
for
the
federal
constitution
in
adopting
that
kind
of
resolutions
on
new
york
and
virginia.
but
in
other
documents
is
there
anyway
or
any
hint
that
the
right
of
suffrage
was
included
within
that
basic
freedom.
the
second
phase,
where
the
court
unimaginably
to
read
the
first
amendment
as
conferring
the
right
of
suffrage,
this
would
contradict
the
position
of
article
1,
section
2,
leaving
that
choice
as
i
said
wholly
to
the
states
and
your
honors
can
have
a
little
doubt
that
that
announcement
we
have
inevitably
defeated
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
and
finally,
number
three,
the
first
amendment
was
of
course
adopted
as
a
shield
against
the
federal
government.
and
it
cannot
now
be
resist
to
absorb
against
the
states
in
that
of
the
suffrage
unless
some
curious
contrary
constructions
were
required
which
is
not,
as
i
shall
show,
whether
that's
in
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
in
short,
the
first
amendment
has
no
reference
at
all
to
suffrage
and
that
is
conferred,
we
suggest
to
the
court,
by
every
subsequent
amendment
to
the
constitution.
why
should
there
be
the
fifteenth
amendment
saying
that
the
right
to
vote
should
not
be
denied
or
bridged
on
account
of
race
or
the
nineteenth
referring
to
sex,
or
the
twenty-fourth
referring
to
the
poll
tax
in
federal
elections,
if
universal
suffrage
had
been
unconditionally
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
it
would
be
a
bold
argument
to
say
that
those
repeated
constitutional
amendments
were
useless,
needless,
and
heedless
which
is
the
essence
of
the
argument
that's
upon
you.
a
point
of
fact
contrary
to
any
conception
of
universal
suffrage
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
first
amendment,
i
say
as
has
been
indicated
by
statements
or
questions
of
the
bench,
poverty
qualifications,
work,
customary,
and
prevalence
throughout
the
states
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
a
few
years
later
of
the
adoption
of
the
tenth
amendment.
passing
then
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
which
great
stress
is
laid
by
all
the
appellants,
we
submit,
that
how
vague
this
counsel
may
be
in
the
face
of
mr.
justice
holmes,
one
thing
is
undeniably
clear
and
that
is
that
it
does
not
include
the
right
of
suffrage.
the
tax
itself
as
your
honors
will
recall
includes
section
2
saying
that
when
the
right
to
vote
is
denied
or
abridged
that
the
representation
of
the
state
in
congress
shall
be
proportionately
reduced
in
(inaudible)
and
that
means
that
the
state
may
discriminate
as
much
as
it
wishes
but
will
pay
the
penalty
in
the
prescribed
manner
for
doing
so.
that
was
not
merely
a
matter
of
interest.
representative
bingham,
mr.
justice
black
has
characterized
or
aptly
as
madison
of
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
who
has
referred
to
himself
conspicuously
in
the
arguments
last
week
in
south
carolina
closed
the
debate
in
(inaudible),
a
very
solemn
and
authoritative
moment
with
this
statement.
the
amendment
does
not
give
as
the
second
section
shows
the
power
to
congress
of
regulating
suffrage
in
several
states.
that
was
the
house.
i
came
to
the
senate.
senator
howard's
speaking
for
the
chairman
of
reconstruction
committee
said
the
theory
of
this
whole
amendment
is
to
leave
the
power
of
regulating
suffrage
with
the
people
or
legislature
of
the
state
and
not
to
assume
to
regulate
it
by
any
clause
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
moreover,
your
honors,
with
your
keen
historical
sense
would
remember
that
when
that
amendment
was
presented
for
ratification,
ten
of
the
23
states
that
ratified
it
prior
to
1870
had
tax
or
property
qualification
requirements
as
conditions
to
the
right
of
suffrage.
massachusetts
was
one
of
them.
new
york,
curiously
enough,
did
not
disqualify
paupers
in
voting
nor
they
required
payment
of
taxes
in
all
cases,
certainly
not
in
the
case
of
white
paupers,
where
it
did
provide
that
men
of
other
races
had
to
own
a
free
home
worth
$250
and
paying
tax
on
it.
six
of
the
states
required
tax
payment
from
all
voters.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
six.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
six
and
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
in
--
it
--
in
1868,
i
believe
it
was,
your
honor,
plus
or
minus
two
years.
my
suggestion
is
that
inconceivable
that
so
many
states
would
spontaneously
undertake
to
reform
themselves
at
the
cost
of
invalidating
their
own
suffrage
requirements
particularly
when
they
have
been
assured,
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
illustrated
by
bingham
and
howard
that
the
amendment
itself
would
have
no
effect
upon
such
values.
they
plainly
acted
on
that
premise
and
congress
itself
acted
on
the
same
premise
a
year
or
two
later
in
readmitting
georgia
with
the
poll
tax
included
in
its
new
constitution.
now,
with
all
those
events,
quite
especially
in
minor,
this
court
in
1875,
rejected
and
attacked
by
a
female
citizen
on
missouri
on
a
local
constitutional
requirement
limiting
the
suffrage
to
male
citizens,
their
contention.
this
is
minor
against
happersett,
1875.
her
contention
was
that
local
law
has
it
all
written
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
the
court
said
certainly
is
the
courts
can
consider
any
question
sensibly.
this
is
one.
for
nearly
90
years,
the
people
had
acted
on
the
idea
that
the
constitution
when
it
conferred
citizenship
did
not
necessarily
consider
the
right
of
suffrage.
the
constitution
has
not
added
the
right
of
suffrage,
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizenship.
pertaining
now,
from
the
fourteenth
amendment,
my
next
suggestion
to
the
court
is
that
that
construction
has
been
successively
and
uniformly
corroborated
by
earlier
amendments.
only
some
three
years
later,
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
proposed
and
promptly
ratified
saying
of
course,
the
right
to
vote
should
not
be
denied
on
reason
on
account
of
race
or
color.
the
meaning
of
that
is
that
until
the
adoption
of
fifteenth
amendment,
a
state
was
free
to
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
or
color
but
not
after
the
adoption
of
the
fifteenth.
the
same
congress,
condemning
the
suggestion
i
just
made,
rejected
numerous
proposals
to
outlaw
property
and
poll
taxes
either
by
an
act
of
congress
or
by
congressional
amendment.
so
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
rejected,
those
provisions,
it
limited
itself
to
a
guarantee
of
immunity
from
discrimination
which
is
what
the
fifteenth
amendment
embodies.
and
following
exactly
that
same
constitutional
canon,
in
1820,
the
nineteenth
amendment
used
precisely
the
same
words
in
giving
immunity
from
discrimination
on
a
count
of
sex.
and
that
again
means
that
until
that
time,
the
right
to
vote
could
be
denied
as
it
indeed
it
was
on
the
grounds
of
sex
but
not
thereafter.
it's
more
important
because
dealing
precisely
where
poll
tax
questions,
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
and
mr.
justice
black
said
that
the
congress
assumes
certain
responsibilities
of
its
own
provides
that
the
right
to
vote
should
not
be
denied
or
abridged
on
--
in
federal
elections
because
of
nonpayment
of
poll
taxes
or
any
other
taxes.
so
in
all
three
instances,
these
parallel
congressional
--
excuse
me,
constitutional
amendment
dealing
with
the
right
to
suffrage,
the
amendment
means
that
the
matter
was
previously
untouched
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
thereafter
would
be
governed
by
the
new
amendment
to
the
extent
expressed
in
the
fifth.
i
emphasized
those
last
three
words
no
further
because
this
was
the
point
of
my
concern
in
the
last
congress
with
regard
to
a
voting
--
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
a
judiciary
recommending
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
emphasized
that
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
would
not
prevent
a
state
from
imposing
a
poll
tax
in
purely
state
or
local
elections.
and
indeed,
it
was
admitted
that
the
amendment
owed
much
of
it
support
to
the
fact
that
it
was
precisely
so
limited.
that
was
announced
in
the
concurrently
accompanying
minority
report
committee.
the
same
effect
on
the
other
side
of
the
senate,
senator
holland,
where
he
was
one
of
the
permanent
cosponsors
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
explained
to
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
in
senate
that
the
amendment
does
not
prevent
the
imposition
of
a
poll
tax
as
a
prerequisite
for
voting
for
state
or
local
elections.
i
emphasized
this
part
as
i
have
continued
because
many
of
us
who
are
cosponsors
strongly
feels
that
the
elections
of
state
and
local
offices
are
more
properly
and
effectively
handed
at
the
state
and
the
local
level.
and
we
would
strenuously
oppose
any
effort
to
control
such
matters
by
federal
law.
now,
i'm
not
asking
your
honors
to
consider
subtleties
or
innuendos.
i
merely
presume
to
recite
a
simple
narrative,
successive
constitutional
amendments
of
uniform
tenure
that
we
submit
established,
general
constitutional
construction
in
accord
with
both
the
text
and
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
thank
you
very
much.
may
i
go
then
to
the
decisions?
would
you
prefer
that
i
take
that
first
or
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes
sir,
i
think
i
will.
the
first
decision
as
i
mentioned
was
of
course
minor
against
happersett.
i
will
not
repeat
that.
but
the
very
next
year,
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
reese
case,
1876,
that
before
the
adoption
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
it
was
as
much
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
exclude
citizens
of
the
united
states
from
voting
on
account
of
race
and
so
forth
as
it
was
on
the
account
of
age,
property,
or
education.
that's
why
they
had
the
fifteenth
amendment.
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
prevent
discrimination
of
any
such
kind.
then
again
in
pope
against
williams
in
1904,
a
maryland
requirement
was
sustained
requiring
registration
one
year
in
that
case,
not
six
months,
one
year
ahead
or,
prior
to
the
election
date
saying
the
privilege
to
vote
in
any
state
is
not
given
by
the
federal
constitution.
no
wonder
my
learned
brother
now
has
difficulty
in
identifying
the
provision
on
which
they
rest.
the
court
continued
with
the
question
whether
the
conditions
prescribed
by
the
state
might
be
regarded
by
others
as
reasonable
or
unreasonable
is
not
a
federal
one.
maybe
because
that's
exactly
the
issue
arrived
by
any
whether
griffin,
a
means
of
the
griffin
because
of
its
intrinsic
appeal
is
a
ground
of
constitutionality
or
not.
your
honors
continued
or
the
court
at
that
time
continued
the
reasons
which
may
have
been
held
the
state
legislature
to
enact
the
statute
in
question
for
matters
entirely
for
its
consideration
and
this
court
has
no
concern
about
it.
the
importance
of
this
principle
in
the
federal
scheme
received
the
attention
of
this
court
soon
after
in
the
guinn
case
in
1915.
there,
the
court
pointed
out
but
the
fifteenth
amendment
did
not
take
away
state
authority
over
suffrage
because
it
had
belonged
to
the
state
governments
from
the
beginning.
and
what
i
do,
this
is
the
essence
that
i
cast
the
whole
fabric
upon
which
the
division
of
the
state
and
national
authority
under
the
constitution's
breadth
would
fall.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
can't
--
for
a
religious
question,
creed
is
of
course
a
test
for
some
purposes
hardly
for
political
purposes
upon
the
theory
which
we
believe
established
by
history
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
deal
with
suffrage
and
recognizing
that
no
amendment
has
yet
prescribed
creed
as
a
permissible
criteria
of
suffrage.
my
answer
is
that
a
constitutional
amendment
would
be
provided.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
well,
that
in
fact
your
honor
comes
at
close
to
the
rash
case
which
in
effect
denied
the
privilege
of
acquiring
citizenship
in
texas
to
say
this
man
and
i
would
hesitate
to
contradict
rash,
mr.
justice
stewart
was
eloquent
in
that
case.
excuse
me.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
think
your
honor
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
and
a
similar
answer
would
be
possible
i
suppose
where
massachusetts
is
to
say
that
a
vote
could
be
cast
only
by
adamson
and
in
south
carolina,
only
by
(inaudible).
it's
refreshing
how
we're
about
to
recollect
if
no
such
occasion
has
yet
risen.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
the
similarities
are
distant.
i'm
puzzled
from
the
moment.
i
don't
commit.
we
come
then
to
breedlove.
the
solicitor
general
alluded
(inaudible)
i
think
rather
faintly
to
the
possibility
that
it
dealt
with
sex.
i
gathered
that
there
may
be
some
implication
from
its
title
to
that
effect.
but
in
point
of
fact,
that
was
not
the
issue
presented
to
the
court.
the
official
report
makes
it
very
clear,
that
the
argument
of
those
attacking
the
local
statute
in
that
case
is
precisely
what
the
court
hears
today
from
a
visible
with
a
characterized
argument
of
the
appellants
in
a
single
sentence.
the
argument
there
was
the
admission
today
that
a
state
has
the
power
to
prevent
its
poor
inhabitants
from
participating
in
the
choice
of
federal
officials
would
be
totally
contrary
to
the
contemporary
spirit
of
american
institution
so
there
couldn't
be
a
squarer
attack
upon
the
power
of
the
state
to
require
payment
of
poll
tax
as
a
condition
to
suffrage.
but
the
court
had
no
trouble
in
disposing
of
that
and
it
said
to
make
the
payment
of
poll
tax
prerequisite
of
voting
is
not
to
deny
any
privilege
or
immunity
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
that
such
a
custom
was
read,
familiar,
and
reasonable
regulation
long
enforced
in
many
states.
mr.
justice
clark
asked
earlier
if
they
went
to
such
a
good
decision.
there
was,
butler
against
thompson,
a
decision
by
a
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
virginia
affirmed
here
per
curiam
in
1951
where
at
a
time
finally
goes
decision
in
virginia
on
the
poll
tax
requirement
precisely
the
same
one
here
in
issue
was
rejected
by
the
court
below
and
affirmed
here
despite
invo
--
the
invocations
of
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
some
of
the
particulars
of
that
argument
felt
more
personally
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
i
shall
come
in
dealing
with
evelyn
butts.
so
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
court
below
in
the
instant
case
rightly
concluded
the
decision
had
been
squarely
settled
by
this
court
both
in
breedlove
and
in
butler.
and
beyond
that,
that
this
court
correctly
so
decided
in
view
of
the
constitutional
text
and
history.
and
during
the
last
two
years,
as
mr.
justice
white
have
indicated,
the
court
is
faced
with
a
number
of
civil
rights
cases.
the
most
prominent
ones
of
course
are
the
reapportionment
cases.
i'm
getting
with
baker
against
carr,
going
on
to
gray
and
sanders,
wesberry
and
sanders,
and
most
lately
reynolds
against
sims.
but
none
of
those
raised
the
question
of
the
qualification
to
vote
which
the
only
question
presented
to
the
court
today.
the
government
here
admits,
page
23
of
its
brief,
that
each
of
the
apportionment
cases
dealt
only
with
the
right
of
persons
qualified
under
state
law
to
vote
and
the
holding
of
the
court
was
put
fair
weight
must
be
accorded
to
a
vote
once
cast.
it
couldn't
mean
to
allot
or
diluted
by
unfair
apportionment
territorial
or
several
means
of
calculation.
another
recent
case
was
united
states
against
louisiana.
that
involved
no
new
principle
that
was
decided
same
day
with
mr.
justice
white's
question,
carrington
against
rash.
indeed
our
principle
as
old
as
yick
wo
against
hopkins
in
1886
namely
that
a
lower
house
who
have
affair
on
its
phase
is
indolent
if
it
is
systematically
employed
to
discriminate
against
a
chosen
race
or
(inaudible).
and
before
as
referred
to
carrington
against
rash,
may
i
mention
two
cases
referred
to
our
brief
and
i
do
so
because
this
comment
was
not
made
in
our
answer
brief.
nixon
against
herndon
and
nixon's
same
intangible
judgment
against
herndon,
1927
and
1932
respectively
challenging
action
of
texas
or
to
be
more
exact,
action
in
texas,
that
denied
him
the
right
to
participate
in
a
primary.
both
of
those
decisions
invalidated
that
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
point
of
my
present
comment
is
that
at
that
time,
classic
had
not
been
decided
intervening
the
primary
with
the
voting
process
that
receives
this
constitutional
protection.
at
that
time,
the
theory
was
that
a
primary
was
a
private
action
of
a
private
route
and
not
state
action
to
which
the
command
of
the
amendment
was
addressed
and
for
that
reason
not
quite
political
question
raising
the
issue
of
suffrage
or
qualification
after
therefore
the
court's
dispose
of
it
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
classic
has
now
reversed
that
doctrine.
a
primary
is
recognized
as
being
an
integral
part
of
the
election
process
such
as
of
the
general
election
itself
and
for
that
reason,
both
of
those
cases
have
now
disappeared.
we
submit
and
just
by
being
swallowed
up
in
their
overall
decision
in
smith
against
allwright
where
the
classic
doctrine
was
applied
to
the
texas
primary,
so
then
carrington
against
rash
deferred
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
there,
an
army
sergeant,
not
born
in
texas,
had
come
to
texas
in
an
on
service.
and
by
their
actions,
the
detail
of
them
not
being
of
interest
except
to
say
they
were
overwhelming
had
satisfied
all
normal
requirements
for
residents
in
texas
to
such
extent
indeed
that
as
the
court
said,
that
texas
conceded
his
right
to
vote
but
for
his
uniform.
but
texas
law
said
that
no
serviceman
may
ever
acquire
a
voting
residence
in
the
state
so
long
as
you
remain
in
service.
and
the
court
held
this
contrary
to
the
equal
protection
clause
as
a
permanent
disfranchisement
of
all
servicemen
as
follows.
turning
back
two
years
senator
sander
said
in
the
debate
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
nothing
can
be
a
qualification
for
voting
which
is
not
in
its
nature
attainable
as
residence,
property,
education,
or
character.
each
of
which
is
within
the
possible
reach
of
well
directed
effort.
but
residence
having
been
admittedly
attained
in
fact
and
recognized
as
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
pointed
out
for
other
purposes
like
divorce,
texas
was
not
at
liberty,
capriciously
and
in
perpetuity
to
disfranchise
a
class
because
of
the
way
they
might
vote
any
more
than
a
vote
could
be
diluted
through
malapportionment
as
in
the
apportionment
cases
of
which
i
suggest.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes,
precisely,
mr.
justice
white.
i
suggest
that
the
real
analogy
of
carrington
is
with
the
apportionment
cases.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
in
light
of
carrington,
i
would
devow
to
say
that
that
was
not
true,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
agree
that
there
are
some
restrictions
of
rationality.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
that
distinction
is
of
course
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
and
your
last
formulation
would
go
a
little
further
and
i
think
it
is
--
if
i
intended
certainly
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
what
i
intended
to
say
was
that
in
carrington,
the
action
of
the
state
so
far
departed
from
the
manifest
facts
of
domicile,
residence
acquired
in
fact
and
recognized
for
other
purposes
that
it
was
in
effect
not
a
good
faith
establishment
of
voter
qualifications
but
an
invidious
disqualification
in
perpetuity
in
that
sense
of
holding
irrational
act.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
well,
i'll
tell
you,
the
proscription
on
negroes
as
a
class
would
violate
fifteenth
amendment
automatically.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
such
a
qualification
as
what,
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
george
d.
gibson
oh
excuse
me.
that
statement
is
like
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
with
regard
to
a
particular
creed
is.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
know
of
nothing
in
history
except
carrington
against
rash
that
has
undertaken
to
apply
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
field
of
voter
qualification.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
they
did
in
fact
and
if
this
court
said
that
they
would,
they
would
have
intended
to
do
so.
in
reese
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
no,
the
reason
why
fifteenth
amendment
was
adopted.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
well,
of
course
mr.
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
congressman
bingham
and
senator
howard's
remark
were
made
with
regard
to
the
whole
of
the
amendment
and
not
merely
a
portion.
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
and
privileges
and
immunities
clause
were
all
intended
to
stop
short
of
regulating
suffrage
in
the
several
states.
that
was
a
vague
debate
in
congress
at
that
time
between
the
civil
rights
and
the
political
rights
of
the
groups
that
are
seeking
to
protect.
and
the
line
was
sharply
drawn
as
they
thought
a
bright
line
between
the
two
so
that
political
rights
were
not,
at
that
time,
commentated
as
being
within
the
protection
of
the
amendment.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
quite
correct.
i
would
think
a
stronger
case
could
be
made
for
the
right
to
vote
being
within
the
protection
of
the
federal
constitution
under
article
1,
section
2
as
applied
to
federal
elections
because
there,
the
question
of
suffrage
was
explicitly
being
dealt
with.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
well,
i
was
going
to
say
that
they
recognized
that
when
article
1
section
2
conferred
the
right
of
federal
suffrage
upon
citizens
who
had
the
qualifications
for
electors
prescribed
by
the
states,
the
fact
made
the
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections
a
federally
granted
right
and
thus
within
the
protection
of
the
statutes
that
were
mentioned.
but
in
doing
so,
article
1,
section
2
does
not,
in
any
sense,
alter
nor
does
it
give
the
congress
the
power
to
alter
the
requirements
that
the
state
may
impose
on
elections
for
local
offices.
so
in
short,
on
carrington,
i
would
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
was
not
actually
a
bona
fide
effort
to
establish
qualifications
to
vote
as
in
any
commonly
understood
sense
of
that
term.
indeed,
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
indicates
that
the
statute
of
texas,
number
one,
was
unique,
and
number
two,
might
well
be
read
as
forbidden
the
acquisition
of
residence
in
texas
for
any
purpose.
i'm
being
concerned
with
that
as
a
capricious
phenomenon
of
equal
protection
in
establishing
residence
rather
than
shooting
at
the
suffrage
privilege.
we
only
have
a
case
that
i
would
like
to
mention
is
the
more
recent
one,
however,
after
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
carrington
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
it
wasn't
asking
for
a
commitment.
merely
on
the
case
that
might
be
mentioned
to
complete
the
catalog
doesn't
take
--
may
take
you
relevant
though
it
is
in
virginia
and
i
mentioned
that's
in
forssenius
case
of
the
last
term
when
the
court
found
that
it
was
not
competent
for
virginia
after
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
i
was
relying
for
the
poll
tax
in
federal
elections
to
exact
as
a
privilege
of
foregoing
payment
on
the
poll
tax.
the
filing
of
a
suppose
residence
certificate
that
had
to
be
executed
by
certain
formalities
that
the
court
being
cumbersome
and
hence
of
a
nature
to
abridge
the
free
exercise
of
the
constitutional
privilege
that
has
no
grounding
here,
i
believe
at
all.
it
seems
just
then
fair
to
summarize
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
by
saying
that
they
have
uniformly
sustained
the
power
of
the
states
over
suffrage
requirements
except
only
in
the
one
instance
of
carrington
where
i
repeat,
it
was
permissible
to
conclude
as
the
court
did
that
there
was
no
good
faith
effort
to
establish
qualifications
but
an
effort
to
deny
the
acquisition
of
those
qualifications
in
perpetuity.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes,
justice
fortas,
they
do.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
think
so.
i'd
like
to
confirm
it
by
asking
the
solicitor
general
marshall,
suppose
he
would
permit.
excuse
me,
i
was
wrong.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
we
--
in
virginia
do
not
have
federal
and
state
elections
at
the
same
time.
so
the
problem
put,
mr.
justice
fortas,
does
not
occur
in
practice.
mr.
george

moving
on
then
to
our
next
point,
it
is
that
the
virginia
poll
tax
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
this
is
insubordination
to
our
general
position
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
such
have
in
full
application
in
any
sense
to
suffrage
qualifications
but
some
particular
comments
on
virginia
poll
tax.
first
of
all,
when
the
amendment,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
i'd
--
if
i
mention
that
six
states
had
tax
requirements
in
effect
as
to
payment
of
taxes,
it's
a
condition
to
suffrage
mostly
in
the
form
of
poll
tax
requirements
and
that
sooner
after
georgia
was
reinvented
with
a
similar
poll
tax
provision
in
their
constitution,
after
screening
by
congress
to
ascertain
its
compliance
with
the
standing
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
because
as
your
honor
said
in
breedlove,
that
was
a
familiar
reasonable
method
of
regulating
suffrage
long
enforced
in
the
states.
again
here,
appellants
reiterate
the
argument
in
breedlove
that
the
house
whether
general
and
prevalent
property
requirements
may
have
been
his
qualifications
for
voting,
that's
the
ownership
property,
as
qualifications
of
voting
and
a
poll
tax
requirements
may
have
been
his
qualifications
for
voting
and
all
that
there
is,
they
are
no
longer
in
keeping
with
modern
conditions
because
they
lost
their
relationship
to
current
conditions.
well,
if
this
court
is
going
to
sit
as
a
guarantee
of
modernity
in
all
practices,
your
docket
will
certainly
be
accounted.
well
actually,
although
that
is
the
appearance
with
which
appellants
would
seek
to
quote
that
appeal,
what
it
really
comes
down
to
is
a
prayer
that
this
court
should
utilize
the
equal
protection
clause
to
extinguish
the
historic
functions
of
the
states
to
regulate
a
matter
that
would
always
been
recognized
as
their
exclusive
providence
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
diversities
of
view
that
you
do
in
accommodating
those
diversities
to
disability
of
the
general
public
as
a
federal
system.
what?
even
if
the
court
referred
you
to
all
of
that
and
to
say
that
wherever
you
think
is
reasonable
is
to
prevail
and
whatever
you
don't
think
is
reasonable
had
to
be
struck
down,
then
even
at
that
point
we
suggest
that
the
virginia
poll
tax
as
presently
on
the
books
and
as
presently
administered
is
rational,
serviceable,
and
nondiscriminatory.
that
being
so
closely
related
to
the
fifteenth
amendment,
we
contend
to
that
unfortunately
as
the
major
point.
and
the
fifth
element
of
it
is
no
racial
discrimination.
when
the
fifteenth
amendment
going
back
now
to
the
time
of
its
proposal
in
congress,
was
under
discussion
in
congress,
amendments
to
prohibit
property
qualifications
or
educational
qualifications
and
to
prohibit
the
poll
tax
in
terms
where
as
i
said
repeatedly
rejected.
and
the
meaning
of
this
was
emphasized
by
senator
(inaudible)
who
said
that
the
amendment,
fifteenth
amendment,
does
not
take
away
from
the
state
the
right
to
regulate
leave
the
states
to
declare
that
a
man
shall
not
vote
and
unless
assessed
to
as
freehold
or
has
an
education
and
can
read
the
constitution,
whole
question
of
suffrage
subject
to
the
restriction
that
there
should
be
no
discrimination
on
account
of
race
is
left
as
it
now
is.
at
that
point,
therefore,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
states
were
free
to
impose
property,
tax,
or
educational
requirements
without
a
prohibition
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
without
regard
to
what
the
consequential
effect
upon
particular
groups
or
races
might
be.
now,
whatever
may
be
the
practice
in
other
states,
it
has
been
repeatedly
found
that
in
virginia,
the
poll
tax
is
in
fact
administered
without
any
racial
discrimination.
the
suffrage
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
if
the
effect
were,
then
your
honor
will
have
a
case
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
correct,
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
believe,
mr.
justice
fortas,
he
did.
counsel
below
said
that
the
hearing
and
i
quote
that
the
only
issue
was
“an
economic
hardship”.
and
in
harper,
counsel
below
said,
again
i
quote,
“we
don't
feel
that
there
are
any
factual
issues”.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
well,
i
believe
it's
going
to
pay
this
that
that
is
an
argument
of
interpretation
based
upon
economic
effect
which
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
--
if
permitted
i
would
like
to
make
my
last
point.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
at
the
moment,
i'm
arguing
that
there's
no
discrimination
against
a
race
as
such
and
that
was
admitted,
i
believe,
by
counsel
below
in
asserting
as
i
quoted
that
their
only
objection
was
that
the
tax
constituted
“an
economic
hardship”
there
endeavor
to
equate
economy
or
the
vast
of
it
with
racial
status.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
it's
got
to
be
economic,
yes.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
could
well
imagine
that.
i
was
on
the
point
of
suggesting
that
it
has
been
repeatedly
found
in
virginia
the
poll
tax
is
administered
and
here
i'm
not
dealing
in
economic
terms
but
in
racial
terms
without
any
racial
discrimination
whatever
and
i
think
that
is
in
the
appellant's
starting
point
on
which
to
weigh
any
consequential
economic
defense.
first
of
all,
in
butler
against
thompson
mentioned
earlier
by
mr.
justice
clark,
the
court
i
affirmed
here
per
curiam,
1951,
the
court
below
found
that
evident
showed
“the
practices
and
procedures
in
administering
the
poll
tax
law
as
its
prerequisite
to
voting
were
precisely
the
same
as
to
negroes
and
white
persons.”
then
the
civil
right,
united
states
civil
rights
commission
in
1959
found,
again
i
quote,
“the
poll
tax
is
not
a
serious
--
a
restriction
as
it
once
was
for
it
is
difficult
to
administer
so
as
to
bar
negroes
alone
from
ballot
box.”
and
two
years
later
in
1961,
the
state
commission
reported
with
that
--
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
deterrent
effect
of
the
poll
tax
which
does
not
appear
generally
to
be
discriminatory
upon
the
basis
of
race
or
color,
negroes
now
appear
to
encounter
no
significant
racially
motivated
impediments
to
voting
in
four
of
the
12
southern
states;
arkansas,
oklahoma,
texas,
and
virginia.
and
to
the
same
effect,
the
court
below
found
in
the
instant
case,
“no
racial
discrimination
is
exhibited
in
application
of
the
tax
as
a
condition
to
voting”,
this
is
how
we
are.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
is
very
appropriate.
i
was
coming
immediately
to
that.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
to
begin
with,
no
declaration
of
fact,
not
purported
finding
of
fact
by
congress
can
be
intrusive
on
this
court
otherwise
the
power
of
this
court
to
review
the
constitutionality
of
federal
legislation
would
be
at
an
end.
in
the
next
phase,
i
use
the
word
‘declaration'
in
the
set
of
finding
because
i
think
that
it's
an
actual
term
to
describe
what
congress
actually
did
in
this
instance
so
far
as
virginia
is
concerned.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
has
referred
to
a
number
of
passages
in
the
record
before
congress
as
supporting
a
finding
of
discriminatory
effect,
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
virginia,
but
what
do
those
references
show?
only
this,
before
the
committee,
one
man,
mr.
tucker
represent
the
international
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
testified
at
second
or
third-hand
hearsay
that
he
has
heard
that
some
commissioners
of
revenue
said
to
some
people
that
they
did
not
have
to
pay
the
tax
unless
they
wished.
the
only
other
thing,
were
declarations
by
two
senators
in
debate
on
the
floor
to
this
effect.
number
one,
the
motives
of
virginia
convention
of
1902
were
bias
and
evil.
and
number
two
that
the
economic
position
of
the
negro
race
in
virginia
was
nearer
the
poverty
level
or
more
within
the
poverty
level
than
in
the
case
of
white
people.
that
was
all
before
the
congress.
so
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
could
not
rationally
be
viewed
as
a
fin
--
a
basis
for
a
finding
in
any
tenable
sense
that
your
honors
could
sustain
for
instance
on
the
appeal
from
an
inferior
tribunal
certainly
as
applied
to
virginia.
i
would
regard
it
more
therefore
as
a
declaration
but
how
are
the
few.
and
according
with
all
respect
that
it's
natural
to
accord
the
facts
of
the
federal
colony,
surely,
it
is
not
conclusive
and
does
not
foreclose.
it
is
a
free
examination
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
indeed,
i'm
sure
they
remember
the
court
will
recall
they
reiterated
admission
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
south
carolina
arguments
last
week
that
they
had
no
evidence
to
present
to
congress
of
discriminatory
practices
in
virginia
said
at
least
two
or
three
times
and
answered
the
questions
from
the
bench.
certainly,
an
idea
and
quite
briefly
with
the
question
of
original
motive,
i
say
quite
briefly
because
essentially
admitted
these
by
one
of
appellants
that
that
has
little
bearing
upon
present
conditions.
it
is
admittedly
true
that
many
of
the
most
prominent
and
extreme
cartographs
i
think
was
the
one
quoted
forssenius
last
year,
members
of
the
constitution
from
1902
said
it
was
their
purpose
to
discriminate
against
the
negro
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
might
permit
them.
but
that
was
by
no
means
the
universal
view
of
the
convention.
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
show
that
it
was
the
prevailing
view
of
the
conventions.
certainly,
there
were
many
other
views
expensed
of
which
i
quote
too.
one
that
by
a
proposed
poll
tax
requirements,
more
white
people
then
will
be
stricken
from
our
registration
rolls
than
negroes.
but
that
was
not
the
basic
aim.
virginia
had
suffered
throughout
an
agonizing
period
of
reconstruction
following
her
defeat
in
the
civil
war
and
her
efforts
to
retrieve
her
statute
of
equality
on
the
states
of
the
union.
and
basically
what
the
convention
wish
to
do
was
to
eliminate
the
illiterate.
and
this
was
expressed
on
the
floor
of
the
convention
that
their
purpose
was
to
eliminate
the
illiterate
“not
only
in
the
country
but
in
the
cities
and
towns,
not
only
among
the
blacks
but
among
whites
in
order
to
deliver
the
state
from
the
burden
of
illiteracy
and
poverty,
and
crime
which
rests
on
it
like
a
deadly
poll”.
and
crucially,
this
was
summed
up
by
another
delegate,
mr.
weiser,
in
his
words
speaking
of
the
poll
tax
requirement
we
can
--
in
its
specific
nexus
of
the
six
months
prepayment.
then
we
have
an
educational
requirement.
the
voter
has
to
pay
a
poll
tax,
prepare
his
own
application,
and
cast
his
own
ballot.
the
plan
virtually
eliminates
the
incompetent
from
politics.
so
we
think
it's
unsupported
to
say
that
the
motives
of
the
convention
were
predominantly
evil
but
even
if
they
have
it,
this
court
has
uniformly
recognized
that
that
is
not
the
ground
of
invalidating
legislation.
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
pointed
that
out
150
years
ago
in
fletcher
against
peck
that
if
for
them
to
say
aptly
one
which
the
legislature
might
constitutionally
pass,
a
court
cannot
entertain
a
student,
founded
on
the
allegation
of
the
interior
motives
which
influence
their
members.
and
more
recently,
the
court
reiterated
in
1951,
tenney
against
brandhove,
the
holding
in
the
court
in
fletcher
against
peck,
that
it
was
not
consonant
with
our
scheme
of
government
for
the
court
to
inquire
into
the
motives
of
legislators
as
remained
unquestioned
and
specifically
on
this
virginia
poll
tax,
the
current
issue,
it
was
held
in
butler
that
a
law
is
fair
on
its
face
and
it's
also
fairly
administered.
it
is
not
rendered
invalid
by
the
equal
motives
of
its
chancellors.
the
question
before
--
the
next
question,
i
would
like
to
take
up
is
the
relationship
of
the
poll
tax
to
the
actual
qualification
of
voters
to
cast
the
ballot.
and
that
on
the
assumption,
extreme
assumption,
i
mentioned
earlier
that
the
court
will
regard
a
test
of
reasonableness
as
controlling
irrespective
of
constitutional
provision.
the
point
of
emphasis
here
is
the
point
i
started
out
with,
that
no
prediction
of
future
election
date
is
required
in
order
to
comply
with
the
six
months
prepayment
requirement
because
the
uniform
rotation
of
the
sun
brings
december
5
back
into
view
every
year.
and
all
that
any
voter
has
to
do
is
to
pay
$1.50
on
or
before
that
date
in
every
year.
and
he's
in
business
so
far
as
the
right
of
suffrage
is
concerned.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
amplifying
my
reply
yesterday
to
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
harlan
with
regard
to
the
so-called
finding
or
declaration
of
congress
instead
of
an
enactment
with
regard
to
the
poll
tax,
the
key
to
that
i
believe
is
readily
found
if
the
court
will
permit
me
to
read
two
brief
excerpts
from
the
hearing,
the
statement
by
the
attorney
general
in
testifying
before
the
house
judiciary
committee.
mr.
katzenbach
said,
“to
eliminate
poll
taxes
on
the
basis
that
they
have
very
often
have
been
used
to
discriminate,
that
is
on
fifteenth
amendment,
i
think
would
be
a
difficult
case
constitutionally
cruel
and
savage.
this
is
1972
hearing
and
qa,
i
think
we
would
have
a
difficult
job
abolishing
them
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
basis.
turning
to
the
hearings
in
the
senate
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
because
the
amendment
to
the
constitution
had
outlawed
them
in
federal
elections.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
in
the
senate,
mr.
katzenbach
testified,
the
president
wanted
to
reduce
the
voting
age
to
18
and
he
was
also
extremely
interested
in
the
elimination
of
the
poll
tax
in
its
entirety
and
wanted
to
do
this.
he
asked
me,
this
is
the
attorney
general,
whether
in
his
prior
days
in
congress,
he
had
been
wrong
in
thinking
that
this
could
not
be
done
by
a
statute.
i
gave
him
the
same
advice
that
i've
given
the
committee
here.
i
think
if
federal
qualifications
as
such
are
to
be
set
then
it
requires
a
constitutional
amendment
to
do
so.
and
again
from
qa,
senator
erwin,
“therefore
mr.
attorney
general,
it
would
be
unsafe
to
base
a
statute
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
is,
would
it
not?”
mr.
katzenbach,
“i
think
the
power
is
derived
from
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
effort
in
that
other
situation
which
was
to
provide
a
further
justification
of
what
was
done
because
of
prior
violations
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
my
judgment
senator,
that
is
a
difficult
argument
to
make.
one,
it
is
unnecessary
and
one
that
i
think
i
would
prefer
were
i
ought
to
bring
this
case
in
the
supreme
court,
not
to
have
to
make.”
senator
fong,
“you
feel
then
that
it
should
be
predicated
only
on
the
fifteenth
amendment?”
attorney
general
katzenbach,
“yes,
i
do
senator.”
senator
fong,
“i
think
it
does
state,
you
did
state
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
think
congress
has
the
right
by
statute
to
eliminate
the
poll
tax
and
i
hear
you
say
that
in
your
opinion?”
attorney
general,
“under
the
fourteenth?”
senator,
“yes.”
“no
senator,
i
do
not
think
they
do.
if
the
payment
of
poll
tax
is
or
the
requirement
for
payment
of
poll
tax
in
order
to
vote
exists,
i
think
that
could
be
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
matter
will
be
considered
by
the
supreme
court
in
its
next
term.
the
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
it
was
not.
it
is
going
to
reexamine
the
question.
i
do
not
see
how
a
decision
by
congress
that
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
really
add
very
much
if
anything
to
the
argument
if
its
already
going
to
be
make
to
the
court.”
mr.
justice
fortas
was
asking
me
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
yesterday
with
regard
to
the
economic
effects
and
whether
it
involved
in
economic
terms,
a
discrimination
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
the
poll
tax.
all
appellants
joined
in
urging
that
such
a
discrimination
does
in
fact
result.
appellant
butts
emphasized
that
as
involving
a
particular
impingement
upon
the
negro
because
of
a
generally
low
level
of
income
in
virginia.
and
indeed,
it
is
true
that
the
proportion
of
negroes
within
the
so-called
poverty
groups
of
this
lower
income
levels
is
greater
than
a
proportion
of
white
people
in
virginia.
but
in
all
honesty,
we
submit,
that
this
objection
is
magnified
beyond
realism,
admittedly
if
one
has
nothing,
he
cannot
pay
anything,
but
taxes
of
fixed
amount
have
in
--
continuously
been
imposed
since
the
foundation
of
the
republic
and
in
virginia
since
the
establishment
of
the
common
law.
and
we
all
know
that
$1.50
is
not
a
large
sum
and
even
within
low
levels
of
income
is
often
spent
for
quite
casual
purposes.
the
senator
in
the
hearings
that
i
referred
to
in
a
moment,
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
said,
"anybody
can
pay
a
two-dollar
poll
tax"
and
attorney
general
katzenbach
replied,
“that
is
correct,”
it's
in
page
194
of
the
senate
hearing.
we
really
submit
an
objection
based
upon
the
payment
of
$1.50
is
so
insubstantial
as
to
merit
dismissal
on
that
ground
alone.
moreover,
as
ogden
cited
in
argument
by
the
appellants
has
found,
the
groups
least
able
to
pay
a
poll
tax
are
also
the
ones
least
interested
in
voting.
it
means
that
the
incidence
of
the
real
prevention
of
voting
because
of
the
$1.50
requirement
is
very
intriguing.
and
if
there
be
within
that
group,
some
people
actually
able
and
willing
to
vote
and
desirous
of
voting,
but
unable
to
pay
$1.50,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
a
situation
of
infrequent
economies
and
it
is
not
an
ordinarily
the
rule.
that
the
statute
workable
in
its
general
operation
would
be
defeated
because
of
some
incidental
and
exceptional
accounts.
moreover,
we
submit
it's
quite
misleading
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
poll
tax
operates
most
extensively
against
the
negro
race,
while
it
is
true
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
there
is
a
larger
proportion
of
the
negro
race
than
white
in
lower
income
bracket.
we
know
quite
well
from
reynolds
and
sims
that
votes
are
cast
by
people
and
not
by
mathematical
fashion,
but
arithmetic
proportion.
the
facts
are,
that
if
there
is
any
particular
economic
impingement
resulting
from
$1.50
a
year
payment,
it
affects
three
to
four
times
as
many
white
people
and
nonwhite
people
in
virginia
because
that
is
exactly
the
ratio
revealed
by
the
census
of
the
people
within
the
law
of
so-called
poverty
levels
of
income
among
white
citizens
to
the
proportion
--
to
the
number
amongst
nonwhite
citizens.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
now
if
that
--
excuse
me.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
mr.
justice
holmes
said
that
it
was
not
true
that
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy
so
long
as
this
court
sits.
and
your
honors
will
find
no
difficulty
in
drawing
lines
between
reasonable
and
traditional
sense
such
as
a
$1.50
or
$2.00
in
other
cases
sustained
by
the
court
and
sensible
figures
that
rarely
impose
objects
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
by
no
means.
my
basic
premise
at
least
your
honor
is
that
the
right
to
vote
in
state
elections
is
a
state
created
right
and
may
be
given
or
withheld
on
such
terms
and
conditions
as
the
state
may
determine.
but
subject
to
that,
passing
beyond
and
as
a
secondary
argument,
we
submit
that
if
a
rule
of
reason
is
to
govern
action
of
the
state,
then
at
that
point,
it
is
reasonable
to
permit
submit
a
poll
tax
of
$1.50
a
year.
i've
propose
in
this
argument,
without
abandoning
the
former
and
on
this
basis,
the
sanctioning
of
poll
tax
of
$1.50
a
year
would
by
no
mean
also,
the
poll
tax
of
$150
a
year
or
$15
a
year.
so
we
turn
back
and
point,
bear
in
mind
that
ratio
of
three
or
four
whites
to
one
nonwhite
in
virginia
of
lower
income
level
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
foreman
maybe
nonwhite
in
one
out
of
three
or
four
instances
in
virginia
does
not
indicate
that
a
tax
or
fixed
amount
discriminates
against
a
race
anymore
than
a
marriage
license
a
fixed
amount
does
or
as
was
suggested
yesterday
from
the
bench,
an
automobile
license
or
any
of
those
charges
that
are
fixed
in
amount.
it
was
also
suggested
from
the
bench
that
sales
tax
upon
which
that
the
court
knows,
the
revenues
of
most
states
have
now
come
to
rely
are
fixed
in
amount,
yet
i
do
not
believe
it's
ever
been
suggested
that
they
are
unconstitutional
on
that
account.
all
taxes
of
that
kind
like
the
$1.50
herein
take
people
as
they
are,
races
as
they
are,
and
are
in
the
words
of
lassiter,
neutral
on
race,
creed,
color
and
sex.
and
quite
apart
from
the
fifteenth
amendment,
if
it
were
to
be
true
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
all
taxes,
for
example,
sales
taxes
would
have
to
be
proportioned
to
the
ability
to
pay,
obviously
that
the
revolution
infrastructure
of
the
country
would
be
a
necessity.
at
the
closing
argument
yesterday,
i
was
just
concluding
the
points
asked,
the
administration
of
the
poll
tax
has
a
rational
and
servicable
usefulness
in
promoting
the
integrity
of
the
ballot
and
an
informed
electorate
in
virginia.
the
key
to
that
is
not
merely
in
the
payment
of
a
$1.50
but
$10.00
as
mr.
general
remarked,
but
doing
so
six
months
before
the
election.
that
as
i
said
does
not
require
a
spot
calculation
of
when
an
election
is
may
be
held.
it
merely
requires
a
payment
of
that
amount
by
december
5
of
every
year
then
you're
sure
that
you
will
be
in
time.
the
reason
for
the
six-month
period
is
to
be
sure
that
people
exit
with
regard
to
matters
of
state,
that
degree
of
attention
and
demonstrate
that
degree
of
competence
that
demonstrates
a
minimal
capacity
to
deal
with
their
own
affair
and
hence
had
participated
in
the
determination
that
they
are
the
state.
that
is
the
rationale
disclosed,
demonstrated
in
the
testimony
of
the
chief
tax
commissioner
of
the
state
who
has
held
that
office
for
39
years.
i
draw
a
sharp
distinction
between
an
understanding
test
of
these[inaudible]
test
which
is
constitutionally
accepted,
what
has
this
demonstration
of
legal
[inaudible].
that
there's
a
conflict
to
be
raised
at
least,
on
purely
subjective
basis
before
held
in
louisiana
subject
to
the
[inaudible].
while
this
in
the
words
of
[inaudible]
tax
commissioner
is
as
mechanical
as
tax.
tax
bills
assess
to
all
known
persons
and
should,
--
if
they
fail
any
instance,
any
person
can
submit
his
tax
to
the
commissioner
of
revenue
[inaudible]
thereafter.
in
short,
i
should
say
tax
commissioner
said
it
is
the
simplest
and
most
legal,
nondiscriminatory
and
authentic
test
of
minimum
intelligence
and
responsibility
that
could
be
derived.
so
under
lassiter,
we
submit
that
literacy
and
illiteracy
are
neutral
on
race,
creed,
color
and
sex.
this
is
a
permissible
criterion
for
the
state
to
enact
and
as
your
honor
said
there,
this
court
does
not
sit
in
judgment
on
the
wisdom
of
that
policy.
we
cannot
say
it
does
not
allow
the
one
on
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
it
may
well
be
true
your
honor
that
a
most
stringent
test
could
have
been
applied
by
virginia.
it
might
well
have
been
legislative
wisdom
for
virginia
to
require
the
payment
of
all
taxes,
but
the
fact
that
she
stayed
her
hand
and
moderated
her
demand,
that
should
not
invalidate
it.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
it
can't
be
done
very
long
as
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
you
go
to
jail
if
you
avoid
the
payment
of
taxes
very
long.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
perhaps
i'm
not
answering
your
honor's
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
oh!
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
would
say
the
income
tax
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
think
they
are
collectible
by
civil
means,
normally
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
think
they
are
collected
by
a
civil
means
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
--
or
factual
thinking,
income
tax
being
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
-
the
proper.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
your
honor
is
quite
right.
well,
it
is
quite
true
that
the
payment
of
all
taxes
is
not
required
as
the
conditions
to
voting
in
virginia.
constitutionally,
it
could
be,
that's
was
a
very
frequent
requirement
throughout
the
history
for
the
19th
century
and
18th
century
as
mr.
chief
justice
well
knows.
this
requirement
is
slighter
in
effect.
it's
designed
not
as
a
financial
requirement
nor
an
overall
test
of
civic
virtue
but
rather
as
an
index
of
minimum
competence
and
only
that.
yesterday,
i
was
asked
about
disfranchising
policy
by
mr.
justice
white
and
that
problem
is
complicated
by
speaking
with
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
disfranchisement
policy
and
as
such,
i
was
commenting
with
that
question
as
complicated
by
allusions
to
the
first
amendment
since
the
british
freedom
or
might
be
drawn.
i
was
asked
also
about
disfranchising
negroes
as
such
and
obviously
that
question
is
contended
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
so
indelibly
that
it's
typical
to
think
the
constitution
in
terms
exclusive
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
like
one
who
had
a
leg
amputated
on
toe,
they
still
feel
still
they
have
one
and
not
[inaudible]
to
believe
that
that
allusion
must
be
someway
emotional,
convinced
that
must
be
someway
--
even
though
history
says
the
opposite.
but
to
disentangle
both
questions
from
those
that
are
overtones,
maybe
restated
in
terms
of
--
is
it
permissible
for
the
state
to
disfranchise
red
haired
people
or
[inaudible]
emotional
information
on
anywhere,
that
i
believe
leads
to
this
answer
that
absurdities
can
be
postulated
that
will
necessitate
a
remedy.
and
it
may
well
be
that
your
honors
were
faced
with
such
a
situation
in
carrington.
certainly,
the
court
declared
through
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
texas
statute
was
unique
and
certainly
carrington
is
the
fifth
case
that
applies
the
equal
protection
clause
to
suffrage
qualification.
those
are
cautionary
circumstances.
they
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
wise
if
i
may
venture
to
submit
that
mr.
justice
to
administer
its
new
vehicle
of
power
with
caution
and
discipline,
otherwise,
it
would
make
wholly
unnecessary
all
the
substitute
amendments
that
the
congress
and
states
have
adopted
in
the
past.
particularly
it
would
seem
unsuitable
to
use
carrington
as
the
vehicle
for
outlying
not
the
exotic,
the
novel,
the
unprecedented,
be
ostensibly
irrational
and
[inaudible]
but
to
use
it
as
a
vehicle
for
outlying
the
familiar
and
traditional
of
what
has
been
done
through
our
history,
what
was
in
fact
been
done
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
when
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
were
in
turn
adopted.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
i
think
they
have
--
mr.
george
d.
gibson
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
you
stating
it
quite
right
there.
we
submit
in
all
deference
and
sincerity
that
the
state
has
exactly
their
original
sovereign
authority
to
fix
without
innovation
the
qualifications
for
suffrage.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
well,
when
if
your
honor
reaches
the
point
and
manifest
and
admitted
absurdity
then
of
course
any
answer
tends
to
be
incredible
on
its
face.
we
admit
that
when
one
reaches
that
limit
of
absurdity
that
forces
or
necessitate
some
remedy
in
the
forms
of
history
and
within
the
normal
ambit
of
familiar
legislation.
my
submission
to
the
court
is
that
the
state
power
is
unequivocal
and
unlimited.
at
the
moment
however,
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
on
the
secondary
premise
that
even
were
that
not
true,
that
a
rule
of
reason
in
abdication
of
guarantee
would
sanction
legislation
act
and
historically
familiar
throughout
the
history
of
the
republic.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
george
d.
gibson
exactly,
i
thought.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
coming
then
to
the
question
of
[inaudible]
that's
construing
then
on
the
note
that
the
poll
tax
is
precisely
one
of
those
familiar,
historical,
well-known,
and
widely-used
legislative
pattern.
your
honors
will
recall,
number
one,
it
was
property
tax
qualification,
poll
tax
qualifications
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
next,
the
court
will
recall
an
1898
in
williams
against
mississippi
a
poll
tax
not
enforceable,
not
collectible,
through
the
civil
means,
but
only
as
a
condition
to
voting,
i
think
the
price
was
$2
a
year,
very
much
like
virginia
poll
tax
here
in
issue
was
sustained
by
the
court
and
that
was
immediate
precedent
for
the
virginia
enactment.
since
then,
this
court
in
breedlove
against
suttles
which
is
the
argument
yesterday
i
submit
reveals
to
be
squarely
controlling
sustained
the
georgia
poll
tax
in
1937.
after
that,
this
court
again
summarily
sustained
this
specific
virginia
poll
tax
in
1951.
we
do
not
submit
that
there
has
been
any
change
of
conditions
since
1937
or
1951,
that's
30
or
15
years
that
could
be
expected
to
lead
the
court
to
reject
such
an
array
of
its
own
decisions
and
such
accumulation
on
historical
passage.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
and
that
for
no
technical
or
should
be
able
to
reason
but
to
fulfill
in
all
phases
the
great
mandate
of
the
constitution
for
a
division
of
authority
between
the
central
and
the
state
government
which
is
the
main
spring
of
the
creation
[inaudible]
about
of
our
federal
system.
mr.
george
d.
gibson
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
we
have
been
privileged
on
yesterday
and
on
today
for
a
lesson
in
history
from
the
appellee.
if
we
take
that
lesson
as
it
was
given,
i
believe
we
would
have
to
conclude
that
mrs.
butts,
the
appellant
and
all
of
those
of
the
like
racial
few
as
her
were
certainly
[inaudible]
for
payment.
for
has
been
said
is
that
we
were
not
given
the
right
to
vote
and
even
if
by
some
stretch
of
the
imagination,
we
were
granted
that
right
or
the
state
granted
us
that
right,
then
we
have
no
redress.
we
think
this
is
a
corruption
of
the
history
that
we
know.
we
think
that
these
rights
do
exist.
what
we
heard,
what
we
have
heard
have
been
a
lesson
in
state's
rights,
a
lesson
in
state's
right
to
take
away,
but
no
comment
upon
the
state's
responsibility
to
its
citizens.
we
have
tried
to
urge
upon
this
court
that
the
citizens,
the
negro
citizens
of
virginia
are
entitled
to
the
right
to
vote
and
that
--
that
right
has
been
taken
away
through
the
discriminatory
action
of
the
constitutional
convention
of
1902.
much
has
been
said
about
whether
or
not
or
about
the
intent
of
the
constitutional
convention.
we
think
a
reading
of
the
record,
a
reading
of
all
the
entire
record
does
show
without
a
doubt
that
it
was
the
intent
of
that
convention
to
take
away
from
negro
the
right
to
vote.
what
did
it
accomplished
or
what
was
it's
purpose?
we
think
that
over
a
period
of
time,
this
court
and
others
have
been
led
to
believe
that
what
has
happened
is
that
individuals
are
--
that
individuals
have
lost,
have
been
--
to
attempt
rather
was
to
take
away
from
individual
negro
citizens
the
right
to
vote
and
if
this
evil
intent
was
alright,
legally
alright
because
at
the
same
time,
white
citizens
have
been
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote.
we
submit
that
the
intent
of
the
convention
of
1902
was
to
disfranchise
the
negroes
as
a
group
and
we
say
to
you
that
places
a
different
light
upon
what
was
--
what
has
been
accomplished
because
following
the
convention
and
the
implementation
of
the
poll
tax
laws
which
had
passed,
the
exact
evil
which
it
intended
has
been
accomplished.
before
this
convention
--
the
poll
tax
laws
provided
by
this
convention,
negroes
held
numerous
state
officers,
including
numerous
seats
in
the
governing
body
of
virginia,
it's
general
assembly.
almost
like
a
magic
wand
after
the
passage
of
this
law,
these
poll
tax
laws
not
a
single
negro
has
sat
in
the
virginia
general
assembly,
and
not
a
single
negro
has
held
a
single
elected
state
office
in
the
state
of
virginia.
we
say
that
the
evil
intent
was
accomplished
and
that
it
was
accomplished
in
direct
confrontation
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we
say
that
there
is
discrimination
in
virginia
which
deprived
negroes
of
the
right
to
vote,
and
we
say
that
this
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
appellees
state
to
you
repeatedly
that
the
administration
of
this
law
has
been
fair
and
equal.
but
the
point
is,
if
you
please,
that
every
time
a
poll
tax
statement
is
made,
there
has
been
a
carrying
out
of
the
act,
the
evil
act
of
the
convention
of
1902.
every
time
a
poll
tax
payment
has
been
collected,
there
has
been
a
furthering
of
the
discrimination
caused,
brought
about
rather,
by
the
convention
of
1902.
every
time
the
clerk
of
a
court
certifies
a
list
of
registered
voters,
it
is
furthering
the
discrimination
of
the
constitutional
convention
of
1902.
by
their
own
figures,
78,000
negroes
earned
between
$1900
per
year
in
virginia,
by
the
appellees
figure,
that
is.
by
the
appellees
figures,
139,000
negro
citizens
earned
from
$1
to
$999
per
year.
by
their
figures,
106,000
negroes
earned
nothing
in
virginia.
these
individuals
have
suffered
the
discrimination
which
again
was
perpetrated
by
the
convention
of
1902.
what
about
the
appellant?
we
say
that
this
violation
of
her
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
now
escalated
and
mushroomed
unto
a
violation
of
her
rights
under
the
first
amendment
for
she
is
thereby
deprived
of
the
right
of
petition.
if
we
may,
the
appellant,
mrs.
butts
presently
lives
in
an
area
of
the
city
norfolk,
virginia
which
is
affected
or
to
be
affected
by
redevelopment
--
by
redevelopment.
she
is
unable
by
reason
of
what
has
occurred,
by
reason
of
the
poll
tax
laws,
she
is
unable
to
petition
for
redress
of
her
condition.
she
cannot
change,
cannot
affect
what
is
occurring
to
her
because
again
of
what
has
happened.
what
virginia
accomplished
by
its
action
in
1902
was
to
create
two
body
politics
in
virginia,
a
white
bodied-politic
and
a
negro
bodied-politic.
the
negroes
have
been
effectively
eliminated
from
any
political
power
in
virginia,
eliminated
and
separated
from
the
political
power
which
is
now
exercised
by
the
whites
exclusively
or
to
the
exclusion
of
negroes,
excuse
me.
