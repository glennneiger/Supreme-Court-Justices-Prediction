mr.
robert
l.
segar
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mrs.
evelyn
butts,
the
plaintiff
and
appellant
in
this
case
brought
this
action
to
have
the
laws
of
virginia
which
require
the
payment
of
a
poll
tax
or
capitation
tax
declared
in
violation
of
the
first,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
this
case
was
consolidated
and
tried
in
the
harper
case
below.
and
after
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
complaint
largely
on
the
authority
of
breedlove
versus
suttles.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
established
by
the
testimony
of
three
witnesses
for
appellant
as
well
as
several
exhibits
which
were
introduced
into
the
record.
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
was
summarized
by
appellant
counsel
and
was
entered
into
the
record
by
stipulation,
although
neither
the
truth
nor
the
relevancy
of
it
was
admitted
by
counsel
for
the
defendants.
the
first
witness,
mrs.
butts,
the
plaintiff
and
appellant,
testified
that
she
lives
with
her
husband.
she
has
no
income
of
her
own
and
his
sole
support
is
a
veteran's
pension.
they
make
a
home
for
their
15-year-old
daughter
and
for
her
90-year-old
father.
she
has
voted
in
the
past
and
she
has
paid
the
poll
tax
in
the
past
although
it
was
always
an
economic
hardship
upon
her
to
do
so.
she's
qualified
to
vote
now
except
for
payment
of
the
tax
which
she
has
not
recently
accomplished
because
of
the
financial
hardship.
she
desires
to
vote.
the
testimony
of
mr.
john
brooks,
the
plaintiff's
second
witness,
was
that
he's
a
salaried
employee
of
the
naacp;
that
he
is
personally
engaged
in
voter
registration
and
get
out
the
vote
rights.
and
that
he's
attempted
to
get
people
to
pay
their
poll
tax
in
virginia
and
to
register
and
vote.
and
then
on
many
occasions,
people
have
told
him
that
they
could
not
register
because
they
could
not
pay
the
poll
tax.
and
he's
observed
these
people,
their
living
conditions,
their
personal
property,
their
dwelling
houses,
and
he
could
testify
that
they,
in
fact,
lived
in
poverty.
the
third
and
last
witness
for
the
appellant
in
the
lower
court
was
professor
louis
ogden.
professor
ogden
is
from
eastern
kentucky
university
on
the
political
science
department.
he's
a
well-known
authority
on
the
poll
tax.
and
his
testimony
was
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
census
figures
with
regard
to
income
and
population
of
virginia
which
are
made
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
that
he
is
aware
of
economic
groupings
and
classes
in
virginia.
and
that
he
believes
based
on
his
studies,
the
writings
of
others,
from
his
personal
investigation
that
the
poll
tax
does
in
fact
inhibit
and
deter
a
voting
in
virginia.
his
testimony
further
was
that
he
believes
that
proportionately,
the
negro
is
twice
as
bad
of
income-wise
as
the
white
and
therefore
that
the
poll
tax
bears
more
harshly
on
the
negro
than
the
white.
plaintiff's
attack
as
i
stated
before
is
under
three
amendments;
the
first,
the
fourteenth,
and
the
fifteenth.
we
believe
that
carrington
versus
rash
and
prior
cases
have
permanently
established
that
a
state's
voting
regulation
is
subject
to
the
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
our
position
is
that
while
the
right
to
vote,
we
believe,
thus
come
from
the
state
in
fact
that
these
cases
have
established,
that
it
is
subject
to
constitutional
guarantees.
and
we
think
that's
beyond
doubt
at
this
point.
we
further
believe
that
in
our
equal
protection
argument,
this
case
is
directly
analogous
to
griffin
versus
illinois.
in
the
griffin
case,
this
court
held
that
the
state
of
illinois
could
not
grant
the
right
of
appeal
to
all
those
accused
and
convicted
of
a
crime
and
then
in
effect
deny
it
to
those
too
poor
to
pay
for
a
transcript.
we
believe
there
are
three
directly
analogous
points
about
the
griffin
case.
first
of
all,
in
griffin,
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
area
of
criminal
regulation
within
a
state,
an
area
which
is
certainly
peculiarly
in
the
state's
domain.
just
as
in
this
case,
we
believe
the
setting
of
voting
qualifications
is
peculiarly
within
a
state
domain,
state's
domain
subject
to
constitutional
guarantees.
secondly,
in
griffin,
the
fatal
vice
or
defect
which
was
pointed
out
was
that
there
was
no
rational
relationship
between
the
ability
to
pay
cost
in
advance
in
the
innocence
or
guilt
of
an
accused
person.
and
in
this
case,
appellant
believes
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
before
here,
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
ability
to
use
the
ballot
and
the
ability
to
pay
a
poll
tax.
the
element
that
is
lacking
here
is
exactly
the
element
that
was
present
in
lassiter
versus
northampton
where
this
court
held
that
a
literacy
test
or
some
relation
to
standards
designed
to
deal
with
the
intelligent
use
of
the
ballot.
well,
we
believe
finally
that
in
griffin,
another
analogous
point
is
that
the
court,
we
feel
went
out
of
it's
way
to
point
out
that
it
was
not
holding
that
the
right
of
appeal
was
itself
essential
to
due
process
in
that
case
but
rather
that
once
having
selected
a
group
who
have
the
right
of
appeal,
the
state
could
not
in
effect
then
deny
it
to
those
too
poor
to
pay
for
the
perfection
of
a
procedural
step.
just
so
here,
appellant
does
not
urge
that
virginia
must
grant
the
right
to
vote
to
all
people.
we
believe
the
state
has
the
right
to
select
those
who
are
reasonably
qualified.
but
we
insist
that
once
having
selected
the
group
of
people
who
are
going
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
reasonable,
logical,
and
rational
qualifications,
he
cannot
then,
under
the
guise
of
another
qualification,
deny
that
right
to
the
people
who
are
too
poor
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
well,
i
would
say
the
same
--
mr.
robert
l.
segar
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
that's
correct.
now,
we
feel
the
tax
has
other
infirmities
--
mr.
robert
l.
segar
i
was
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
said
i
felt
a
property
tax
requirement
would
have
no
more
validity
than
the
poll
tax.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
property
qualification.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
i
meant
property
qua
--
if
i
did,
i
mean
property
qualification.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
we
believe
the
virginia
tax
has
other
infirmaries
in
addition
to
this
problem
of
equal
protection.
and
that
is
this,
the
tax
provisions
are
so
inherently
unreasonable
as
to
themselves
amount
to
denial
of
due
process.
the
requirement
of
the
tax
to
be
paid
six
months
in
advance
at
a
time
when
nobody's
interest
in
an
election
is
high
when
the
candidates
are
not
out
on
the
stomp
and
when
people
are
just
generally
not
concerned
is
itself
an
unreasonable
administrative
requirement.
the
three
year
accumulation
requirement
adds
to
the
problem.
the
fact
that
there
is
no
uniform
method
of
assessment
in
virginia
so
that
those
who
own
sufficient
property
of
one
kind
or
another
to
be
taxed,
get
a
tax
notice
also
make
it
have
built
for
the
poll
tax,
and
those
who
do
not
own
sufficient
property
will
not
get
billed.
and
finally,
the
final
step
in
this
ridiculous
picture
is
the
fact
that
by
constitutional
provision,
the
state
of
virginia
is
forbidden
from
collecting
the
poll
tax
by
legal
process
for
three
years
after
he's
become
due
or
in
short
until
the
tax
has
cease
to
affect
anybody's
right
to
vote.
we
feel
we've
taken
together
these
administrative
steps
amount
to
the
fact
that
as
the
government
so
aptly
stated
in
its
brief
quoting
from
a
case
the
tax
represents
a
trap,
not
a
test.
we
think
that
it
amounts
to
a
denial
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
because
there's
no
rational
justification
for
these
administrative
steps.
the
tax
is
certainly
not
a
revenue
measure
as
that
term
is
normally
understood.
first
place
all
of
these
provisions
are
designed
to
discourage
the
collection
of
revenue.
secondly,
the
highest
court
of
virginia
has
expressedly
stated
that
it's
not
to
raise
revenue.
the
justification
that
the
taxes
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
whether
a
person
is
interested
enough
in
qualifying
himself
to
vote,
in
our
opinion,
simply
does
not
hold
water.
for
one
thing,
it
assumes
that
everybody
who
wants
to
vote
can
afford
to
pay
the
tax;
something
which
we
believe
simply
is
not
true.
secondly,
if
there
was
any
validity
to
the
test
idea
here,
it
could
be
accomplished
simply
enough
without
the
payment
of
a
tax.
the
payment
of
a
tax
is
unnecessary
there.
so
we
believe
when
taken
together,
all
of
these
procedural
steps
themselves
amount
to
a
denial
of
due
process.
now,
there
are
many
census
figures
which
we
have
included
in
the
record
through
exhibits
which
rendered
additional
to
testimony
that
was
taken.
and
we
believe
that
the
record
establishes
three
main
facts
here.
one
that
there
is
great
poverty
in
virginia;
secondly,
that
poverty
is
worst
among
the
negro
people
than
the
white
people,
and
finally
that
the
poll
tax
does
inhibit
and
deter
a
voting.
and
i'm
not
going
in
one
of
those
statistics.
i
must
ask
too
because
some
of
them
have
been
quoted
before.
i
might
just
mention
one
to
give
an
idea
of
the
nature
and
gravity
of
the
problem
in
virginia.
in
this
1960
federal
census
dealing
with
the
year
1959
in
a
table
which
included
the
incomes
of
people
over
14
years
of
age,
the
great
majority
moreover
21,
in
virginia
there
were
800,000
people
without
income
and
1,900,000
with
income.
now,
that
1,900,000
approximately
1,125,000
earn
less
than
$3,000,
a
figure
which
has
been
designated
by
several
governmental
agency
as
the
income
level
below
which
a
family
is
living
in
poverty.
the
statistics
could
go
on
and
on
to
show
the
numbers
of
people
that
are
earning
income
at
this
bare
subsistence
level.
similarly,
as
to
the
comparison
of
the
negro
people
and
the
white
people,
there
are
many
statistics
which
indicate
that
relatively
the
negro
is
almost
proportionally
twice
as
badly
off
as
the
whites.
it
was
quoted
before
where
families
were
broken
down
on
the
census,
22%
of
the
whites
earn
less
than
$3,000,
54%
of
the
negroes.
and
it
goes
on
adding
some
items
if
we
compare
those
statistics.
finally,
as
far
as
the
tax
actually
inhibiting
voting,
we
rely
on
the
testimony
of
professor
ogden,
and
acknowledged
experts
on
the
tax
as
well
as
on
the
fact
that
this
court
does
not
need
an
expert
witness
to
tell
if
that
person
cannot
afford
three
meals
a
day,
he
is
going
to
think
twice
about
paying
for
the
right
to
vote.
and
of
course,
the
administrative
provisions
that
we
have
talked
about
resulting
to
disenfranchise
of
--
disenfranchising
of
many
people
even
those
who
could
normally
afford
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
is
discriminatory
that
that
isn't
discriminatorily
applied.
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
refuse
--
the
state
of
virginia
refuses
to
allow
negroes
to
pay
the
poll
tax
or
discourages
it
but
there
is
evidence
and
we
make
the
fifteenth
amendment
claim
which
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
tax
in
actuality
is
discriminatory
and
is
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
argument
is
based
on
economic
statistics
but
not
on
the
action
of
administrative
officials.
before
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
segar
no.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
well
i
--
we're
not
talking
about
the
validity
of
this
tax.
we're
talking
about
tying
it
to
voting.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
well
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
segar
well
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
segar
well,
the
relevancy
of
economic
statistics
is
merely
this.
going
back
historically,
the
poll
tax
was
originally
a
liberal
departure
from
the
property
holding
qualification
for
voting
which
was
being
discussed
before
i
begin
to
speak.
harvard
--
at
the
time
of
the
virginia
constitutional
convention
of
1902,
there'd
be
no
question
that
the
poll
tax
was
merely
one
of
many
ways
which
were
considered
in
order
to
disenfranchise
the
negro.
in
fact
this
court
as
recently
as
harman
versus
forssenius
this
year,
it
so
stated
that
the
virginia
poll
tax
was
born
of
a
desire
to
disenfranchise
the
negro.
now,
our
position
is
simply
this.
it's
not
hard
to
understand
why
an
economic
weapon
was
one
of
those
chosen.
historically,
the
negro
had
emerged
from
slavery
after
the
civil
war
without
property
and
with
small
economic
means.
his
position
has
been
slowly
improved
and
has
been
slowly
improved
until
the
day.
in
1902,
the
framers
of
the
virginia
constitutional
convention
on
the
poll
tax
realized
that
fact.
and
they
had
in
mind
the
elimination
of
the
negro
as
a
significant
political
group
and
we
feel
this
is
demonstrated
by
several
quotes
in
our
brief
from
the
convention
itself.
and
they
picked
an
economic
weapon
because
they
knew
this
would
be
a
disenfranchising
weapon.
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
this
is
what
they
set
out
to
do
plus
the
fact
that
the
statistics,
the
statistical
evidence,
bears
out
the
fact
that
negroes
are
significantly
in
a
major
way
worse
off
than
whites
income-wise
and
have
been
so
historically
means
that
the
tax
as
it
was
intended
bears
more
harshly
on
them.
and
we
say
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
it
may
disenfranchise
a
lot
of
whites
at
the
same
time.
the
purpose
was
to
eliminate
the
negro
and
we
feel
that
it's
dominant.
and
we
feel
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
segar
well,
i
don't
rest
it
solely
on
the
motive.
and
i
don't
think
the
motive
enough.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
yes,
that's
right.
but
i
--
the
purpose
is
not
enough
itself.
i
would
not
say
the
purpose
itself
invalidate
the
test.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
in
the
context
of
its
purpose,
the
fact
that
it
accomplishes
the
purpose,
the
fact
that
it
accomplishes
the
purpose,
that
is
--
that's
where
the
evil
lies.
i
don't
think
it
matters
what
the
motives
are,
there
isn't
any
evil
effect
from
the
tax.
and
i
think
looking
for
the
purpose
of
the
tax
merely
serves
to
point
out
the
context
in
which
we're
working
here.
i
think
the
evil
is
that
it
does
discriminate
against
negroes
because
they
are
identifiable,
an
identifiable
poor
class.
and
the
framers
knew
that
when
they
drafted
this
legislation.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
that's
right.
but
again,
i
don't
say
that
the
poll
tax
is
bad.
i
say
the
tying
of
the
voting
is
bad
just
as
i
say
that
tying
of
any
sales
tax
or
any
other
tax
to
voting
would
be
bad.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
are
you
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
segar
no,
no,
i
would
not.
i
think
it's
a
--
i
would
say
that's
a
complete
different
situation
for
several
reasons.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
driving
is
different
from
voting,
and
also
drivers'
licenses
--
there
might
be
some
germane
purpose,
the
charging
of
the
license
tax
or
post,
or
fee
in
case
of
the
driver's
license.
getting
on
to
prior
authorities
in
this
case,
namely
breedlove
versus
suttles,
appellant
believes
that
breedlove
versus
suttles
can
be
distinguished.
as
we
read
breedlove,
it
decided
three
things.
it
decided
there
was
no
violation
of
the
nineteenth
amendment.
it
decided
that
voting
was
not
a
privilege
or
immunity
of
united
states
citizenship
under
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
neither
of
which
points
until
we
dispute
here.
and
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
decided
that
the
exemptions
for
women
and
for
this
--
for
women
who
do
not
register
to
vote
and
for
people
over
60
were
not
unreasonable
if
the
state
could
do
this.
the
attack
on
the
equal
protection
clause
in
that
case
was
in
effect
that
if
you
tax
us,
you
have
to
tax
everybody.
the
attack
here
is
just
a
converse.
we're
saying
that
you
can't
tax
anybody.
and
in
fact
in
breedlove,
the
court
noted
that
the
tax
--
that
in
justifying
the
exemptions
that
often
there
would
be
people
too
poor
to
pay
the
tax
and
to
enforce
it
equally
would
be
harsh
and
unjust.
in
the
cases
after
breedlove,
we
feel
either
relied
on
breedlove
or
involve
points
that
are
not
at
issue
here.
our
appellants
suggest
that
if
the
court
feels
that
breedlove
does
rule
this
case,
then
it
should
be
overruled.
i've
already
discussed
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
i
just
want
to
briefly
take
up
the
first
amendment
argument
which
we
have
also
raised
in
the
complaint
and
carried
on
through
this
step
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
i
think
that
based
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
a
fifteenth
amendment
violation
that
they
would
have
a
right
to
pass
it,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
no,
i
don't
have
any
doubt
on
that.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
well,
i
think
--
i
think
--
well,
i
think
that
the
congress
thought
that
in
--
in
their
authority
under
section
2,
they
implemented
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
they
could
do
whatever
they
feel
is
necessary.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
i
think
there
was.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
dubious
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
l.
segar
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
no,
i
was
not.
we
don't
base
our
case
on
it
and
the
congress
said
whatever
section
said
that.
in
fact,
our
case
started
prior
to
the
1965
voting
rights
act
and
is
no
way
dependent
on
it.
and
that
that
act
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
incidentally.
mr.
robert
l.
segar
i
would
have
been
what?
mr.
robert
l.
segar
oh,
that's
right,
absolutely.
giving
out
my
final
point
and
that
is
the
first
amendment
argument,
the
court
has
on
several
occasions
noted
that
other
rights
are
protected
through
the
first
amendment
incorporated
under
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause
but
other
than
those
rights
specifically
spelled
out
within
the
first
amendment,
that
is
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
religion,
freedom
of
assembly.
we
think
that
the
court's
holdings
on
this
first
amendment
area
can
generally
be
summarized
by
saying
that
any
action
which
is
a
form
of
political
expression
has
generally
been
protected.
now,
this
has
involved
cases,
we're
petitioning
through
the
courts
who
have
been
involved,
the
use
of
litigation
to
obtain
equality,
and
similar
areas.
it's
appellant's
position
that
voting
is
the
highest
form
of
political
expression.
that
all
other
political
activity
is
to
no
avail
that
it
can
influence
people
who
have
to
cast
a
ballot.
further,
in
this
area,
appellant
believes
that
this
court
has
stated
on
several
occasions,
notably
in
the
american
press
company
or
grosjean
versus
american
press
company
that
the
power
to
tax
and
the
power
to
destroy
especially
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights.
and
the
po
--
that
principle
is
nowhere
better
illustrated
than
in
this
case
where
the
dollar
and
fifty
is
legitimate
than
$50
is
or
a
$100.
furthermore,
those
people
who
are
disenfranchised
by
the
tax
or
just
little
people
that
cannot
do
anything
about
it,
their
method
of
redress
to
the
government
is
close
to
them
because
they
cannot
vote.
we
feel
that
what
this
court
said
in
wesberry
versus
sanders
and
reiterated
in
reynolds
versus
sims
adequately
sums
up
the
situations
regarding
our
position
on
the
poll
tax.
one
of
the
most
precious
rights
in
a
free
society
is
that
of
having
a
voice
in
the
election
of
those
officials
who
make
the
laws
under
which
we
as
good
citizens
must
live.
other
rights,
even
the
most
illusory
are
--
or
rather,
other
rights
even
the
most
basic
are
illusory
of
the
right
to
vote
is
undermined.
and
our
constitution
has
no
room
for
classification
of
people
in
such
a
way
as
to
unnecessarily
abridge
that
right.
we
think
the
virginia
poll
tax
laws
are
inconsistent
with
that
declaration.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
to
be
handled
by
co-counsel,
mr.
j.a.
jordan.
