justice
tom
c.
clark
what
must
did
you
say
they
had
to
pay?
justice
tom
c.
clark
prior
then
before
january,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that'd
be
impossible
for
a
soldier
that
was
discharged
in
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
one
of
the
exemptions
though.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
exempt
the
first
year.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
to
vote.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
don't
pay
at
first.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
applies
to
everybody.
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
the
tax
went
to
(inaudible)
elections.
justice
tom
c.
clark
where
does
this
fund
goes?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
do
not
deal
with
qualifications.
justice
tom
c.
clark
those
cases
do
not
deal
with
qualifications,
do
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
where
is
the
right
to
vote
spring
from?
justice
tom
c.
clark
federal
or
state
government.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(voice
overlap)
who
would
like
to
vote
in
the
federal
elections.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
would
be
contrary
to
breedlove
and
in
other
cases,
wouldn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
wilkins
said
at
the
same
time,
i
think,
that
a
federal
case
(inaudible)
certainties
out
of
virginia.
justice
tom
c.
clark
there's
another
one
under
the
name
of
thomas
or
something
like
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
fact,
in
those
cases,
i
thought
was
in
fact
the
pure
intention
of
the
ballot
box.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
didn't
have
any
qualification
problems,
did
it?
those
were
cases
where
they
either
count
the
box
but
didn't
count
the
votes
that
were
deposited
in
the
box.
justice
tom
c.
clark
alright,
in
those
cases
are
within
the
facts
and
qualifications
also.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
that
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
just
like
you
have
to
think
--
you
have
to
fix
the
position
that
we
have
to
overrule
breedlove.
what
you
--
since
you
state
that
the
right
to
vote
springs
some
of
the
federal
questions
without
relating

justice
tom
c.
clark

understand.
justice
tom
c.
clark

was
a
broad
language,

it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
