justice

black
what
did
you
do
in
the
breedlove?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
they
have
to
overrule
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
amount
of
the
poll
tax
now
in
alabama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
an
accumulated
poll
tax
that
buys
voting
or
it's
just
one
statement,
one
year
statement
analysis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maximum
is
$4.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
i
suppose
that
de
novo
be
use
for
that
purpose
and
it
could
bar
a
man
from
defending
a
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
have
you
looked
to
see
of
whether
or
not
any
state
now
in
prescribing
the
qualifications
for
their
voters
require
property
ownership
of
any
amount?
they
do
for
jurors
but
i'm
not
sure
about
voting.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
--
would
you
think
your
argument
would
go
far
enough
to
strike
down
the
qualifications
of
that
kind,
property
ownership?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
might
be
--
it
might
be
with
reference
to
some
of
the
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
certainly
show
it
if
it
--
if
it
depended
only
on
history.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
might
say
i
can't
follow
you.
the
state
can't
have
a
poll
tax
and
can
have
a
property
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i
meant
to
that
not
the
prosecution
does
enough
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
qualification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
say
property
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
relevant,
that
would
apply
to
the
payment
of
all
taxes,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
not
do
to
the
income
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
i
can
understand
that
but
i
don't
quite
get
the
relevance
here
of
the
statistics
about
how
much
money
people
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
get
the
relevance
that
there's
much
evidence
in
any
constitutional
place
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
particularly
don't
get
it
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
that
--
that
argument,
if
you
should
win
on
that
ground,
i
suppose
if
another
state
to
show
that
its
poll
tax
didn't
have
that
motive,
it
would
be
valid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
purpose,
i
think
what
you're
stating
it
well
its
own
history.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
effect,
like
the
sales
tax
does
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
that
since
you've
brought
up
that,
i
understand
that
it
seems
to
be
something
in
here
that
our
congress
--
somebody
didn't
want
--
didn't
want
to
pass
a
law
by
congress
under
part
two
of
the
amendment.
they
wanted
to
pass
the
burden
over
to
us
to
act
on
the
constitutional
grounds.
would
you
have
any
doubt
that
congress
have
relied
under
section
2
of
the
amendment
--
fifteenth
amendment
to
provide
that
poll
tax
has
stand
in
a
way
of
voting,
the
only
kind
of
rates,
and
pass
the
law
as
they've
done
with
reference
to
the
educational
qualification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
it
was
a
fifteenth
amendment
violation.
i'm
saying
that
--
they
would
--
this
congress
--
wouldn't
congress
have
the
right
under
section
2
which
gives
it
a
right
to
legislate
--
hope
that
legislation
to
enforce
it,
wouldn't
it
--
is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
that
they
would
have
a
right
to
treat
the
--
this
poll
tax
exactly
as
they
treated
the
literacy
test
assuming
that
they
are
valid.
i'm
only
assuming.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
read
somewhere
that
somebody
gave
advice,
that
that
couldn't
be
done.
that
ought
to
be
passed
over
to
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
legislation
might
be
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
thought
legislation
would
dubious
by
the
congress
which
had
the
power
under
section
2
to
pass
a
law.
but
it
wouldn't
--
they
didn't
seem
to
have
any
doubt,
you
mean
that
the
court
could
do
it
even
though
the
congress
couldn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
requirement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
case
--
suppose
this
case
be
concluded
by
going
to
a
point
[inaudible],
would
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
of
the
constitution
with
that
violation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
does
the
guarantee
go?
which
officers
are
required
by
the
constitution
or
which
agent
does
the
state
be
elected
by
the
voters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
could
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
could
answer
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
rather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
rather
unique
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
least,
i
haven't
heard
it
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
an
you
say
that
state
is
without
the
power
if
it
desires
to
do
so
[inaudible]
for
federal
elections.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
which
one
of
these?
which
one?
most
of
the
--
most
of
the
agencies
in
the
state
are
appointed
and
not
--
it's
not
elected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
judges?
is
it
required
that
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
for
the
state,
be
elected
by
voters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
of
the
argument
is
based
on
that
premise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
would
we
draw
the
distinction?
would
the
court
have
to
draw
the
distinction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
a
long
time
of
course
the
senators
were
not
elected
by
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
it
was
inconsistent
--
very
strongly
thought
it
was
inconsistent
with
what
the
government
ought
to
do
and
reverse
strongly
for
the
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
effect,
you're
asking
us
to
read
into
the
right
to
vote?
