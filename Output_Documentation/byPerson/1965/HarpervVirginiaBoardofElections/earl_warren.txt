earl
warren

i
see
that.
just
for
that
one
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
one
else
can
pay
--
no
one
else

chief

has
there
been
any
definition
with
the
word
â€˜pauper'
for
this
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
these
are
anything
in
the
economic
status
of
these
people
other
than
they
are
impoverished?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing
like
that
--
and
they
have
mean
in
the
county
hospital
that
they
serve,
anything
of
that
kind,
it's
just
that
they
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
just
people
who
have
very
little
means.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
how
can
you
possibly
distinguish
between
your
turnstile
case
for
a
man
who's
--
who
could
pay
a
dollar
before
he
can
go
through
the
turnstile
and
vote
and
a
case
where
a
man
is
required
to
bring
a
tax
receipt
before
he
goes
through
the
turnstile.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
isn't
it
six
of
one
and
a
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
whether
a
fellow
is
required
to
--
to
pay
a
poll
tax
to
vote
or
he's
required
to
pay
a
personal
property
tax
before
he
can
vote.

chief

et

mr.
gibson,
you
may
continue
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
in
reference
to
local
elections?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gibson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
have
you
to
say
to
the
argument
that
was
made
that
--
if
this
is
to
show
the
responsibility
of
a
citizen
and
therefore
his
ability
to
vote
intelligently,
that
although
you
prohibit
a
man
from
voting
if
he
doesn't
pay
this
$1.50,
that
he
can
avoid
thousands
of
dollars
of
other
taxes
in
the
state
which
would
indicate
that
he's
an
irresponsible
citizen
and
still
he'd
be
entitled
to
vote.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
applied
--
it
applied
it
to
in
the
manner
that
would
perhaps
militate
against
the
poor,
but
in
those
sense
against
the
rich
who
can
avoid
taxes
of
any
amount
and
still
vote.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
he
did
know
that.
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
the
--
a
personal
property
tax
or
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
real
property
tax.
they
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
go
to
jail
in
virginia
for
not
paying
those
taxes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
my
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
my
experience
anyway
in
the
--
chief
