justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
a
fortiori
than
any
--
any
property
qualifications
for
voting
and
say
existent
in
any
of
the
states
would
be
--
would
fall
under
your
argument,
i
suppose,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
this
local
elections
for
bonds,
approval
of
bonds
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
1870,
the
case
came
up,
breedlove
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
--
would
you
require
the
states
in
that
sooner
once
the
state
(inaudible)
those
over
21
would
take
the
head
tax
or
the
poll
tax
or
a
property
qualification
had
some
connection
with
voting
just
like
it
might
have
had
in
the
middle
of
the
19th
century.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
assume
that
--
to
assume
because
you
don't
have
money,
you
weren't
qualified
to
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
rational
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
of
today.
as
of
19
--
1850,
it
might
have
been
different.
the
difference,
that
difference
might
have
been
the
irrational.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
the
due
process
argument,
was
that
it
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
isn't
it
rash
on
qualifications
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
would
--
you
think
you
could
draw
some
sensible
distinction
between
the
property
qualifications
of
the
poll
tax
as
a
condition
of
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
today
and
these
days.
i
mean
based
on
your
argument,
i
don't
--
i
don't
get
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
property
qualification
in
vermont?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
think
you
could
show
that,
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
think
if
you
show
there
were
some
connections
between
voting
and
property?
couldn't
that
--
wouldn't
it
have
just
as
much
a
chance
of
showing
a
connection
between
poll
tax
and
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
--
and
you
say
the
argument
would
apply
in
a
community
of
rich
people
where
everyone
is
rich.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
really
a
due
process
argument
but
not
an
equal
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
you
would
also
allocate
these
requirements
for
this
fellow
to
vote
or
it
must
seem
trouble
giving
a
piece
of
paper
as
some
certification
to
somebody
who
had
paid
all
the
taxes
during
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
property
question
also
that
--
that
if
he
didn't
have
any
money,
why
--
he
wouldn't
be
taxed
for
it.
well,
let's
say
that
nevertheless
paupers
and
everybody
else
would
have
to
pay
their
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
felons?
how
about
the
fellow
or
the
fellow
who's
in
jail
because
he
didn't
pay
his
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he's
out
now.
he's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
he's
a
felony.
he's
got
a
record,
criminal
the
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
use
to
go
--
where
does
that
leave
you
on
carrington
and
rash
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
no.
well
you
go
--
you
go
right
ahead
if
you
will
reach
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
your
view
--
excuse
me
sir
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
take
a
constitutional
amendment
in
your
view
to
prevent
a
state
from
excluding
say
protestants
to
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
if
you
--
like
if
you
--
and
similarly
if
virginia
wanted
to
say
the
only
people
who
can
vote
in
virginia
are
those
who
were
born
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
almost
have
the
same
answer
that
if
i
take
it,
a
constitutional
amendment
to
restrict
virginia's
privilege
in
so
qualifying
its
voter
--
voters.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
and
that
someone
think
that
the
situation
we
have
here
is
quite
similar.
i
guess
we'll
have
to
wait
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
equal
protection
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
forbids
for
--
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
until
the
--
until
shortly
before
the
fifteenth
amendment,
many,
many,
many
states
did
prevent
negroes
from
voting,
did
they
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
view
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
position
solely
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
charge
would
be
useful
to
park?
