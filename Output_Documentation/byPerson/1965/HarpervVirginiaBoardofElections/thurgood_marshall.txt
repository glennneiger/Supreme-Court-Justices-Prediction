mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appears
in
this
case
because
of
the
great
importance
that
our
government
attaches
to
the
whole
problem
and
while
the
poll
tax
is
today
in
full
force
only
in
four
states,
virginia
alabama,
mississippi
and
texas;
and
secondly,
by
virtue
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
applies
only
to
state
elections.
it
remains
a
serious
clog
in
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
what
is
more,
the
problem
of
the
poll
tax
is
a
real
value
to
voting
has
become
more
not
less
acute.
and
the
reason
is
that
with
the
removal
of
most
of
the
restrictions
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
poll
tax
is
going
to
be
the
one
weapon
left
remaining
and
then
it
will
come
into
its
full
position,
i
assert.
and
there's
another
aspect
to
the
urgency
of
the
question.
and
i
have
some
hesitation
and
to
mention
it
in
this
case
which
across
the
laws
only
in
virginia.
but
after
all
the
ruling
here
may
well
govern
elsewhere
and
the
court
should
know
the
realities
of
the
situation,
the
fact
is
that
many
thousands
of
persons
in
alabama
and
mississippi
registered
for
the
first
time
under
the
1965
act,
whether
through
the
regular
state
registrars
or
federal
examiners,
most
of
them
simply
did
not
pay
their
poll
taxes.
and
these
states
unlike
virginia,
payment
of
poll
tax
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
registration
but
it's
only
a
prerequisite
to
voting.
and
of
course
if
the
tax,
the
poll
tax
is
the
constitutional,
they
will
not
be
entitled
to
vote
in
the
forthcoming
general
primaries
in
may
in
alabama
and
june
in
mississippi.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
alabama?
a
dollar
and
a
half.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
virginia,
alabama,
texas,
and
mississippi.
that's
where
they
had
before
but
the
marked
one
is
a
very
limited
one
and
i
don't
think
we
need
too
much
of
it
in
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
that
i
know
of.
the
information
i
have
is
that
it's
only
four
that
have
the
full
ones.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
alabama
is
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
two
year
accumulation.
mississippi
is
$2,
two
years,
and
texas
is
$1
for
one
year.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
maximum
is
what
i
understand
it.
well,
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
is
that
our
position
we
wish
to
take
in
this
case
is
broad
as
possibly
could
be
considered
whereas
the
petitioner
in
these
cases
are
poor
people.
the
argument,
as
we
see
it,
would
apply
equally
if
the
wealthiest
person
in
virginia
had
refused
to
pay
his
poll
taxes.
our
basic
reason
is
that
you
cannot
put
a
tax
on
the
right
to
vote
in
any
form
or
fashion.
while
considering
the
argument
in
this
case
i
happened
to
be
in
new
york,
the
strike,
and
i
think
my
analogy
--
my
knowledge
is
correct.
while
a
city
can
without
question
charge
for
writing
on
the
municipal
subway
and
put
up
a
turnstile
where
you
have
to
put
in
the
15
cent
token,
i
don't
believe
anybody
will
try
to
support
a
plan
where
you
had
to
put
in
a
dime
in
a
turnstile
when
you
went
into
vote.
it
just
is
completely
opposed
to
any
form
of
democratic
government
i
can
think
of
and
this
is
even
worst.
because
in
virginia,
it
would
be
bad
enough
if
you
had
to
pay
the
dollar
and
a
half
and
buy
a
ticket
before
you
went
into
vote.
but
this
you
have
to
pay
it
six
months
in
advance.
and
whereas
some
people
normally
get
it
on
their
tax
bills,
there
are
others
that
don't
have
tax
bills.
and
they
don't
know
about
it.
and
this
i
think
the
court
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
there's
not
too
much
interest
in
the
election
six
months
in
advance.
so
i
say
my
turnstile
example
is
a
position
that
even
virginia
can't
rely
upon.
the
--
your
question
immediately
comes
up
as
to
how
does
that
arise
to
a
constitutional
question
was
very
simple.
when
our
constitution
was
drafted,
it
was
drafted
with
the
full
realization
that
we
want
to
have
a
government
of
the
people,
the
republican
form
of
government
to
be
guaranteed
and
the
basic
rule
set
down
for
qualification
of
voters.
but
i'm
sure
the
constitution
did
not
consider
the
possibility
of
a
state
not
holding
an
election.
they
assumed
that
the
states
would
hold
elections.
indeed,
they
assumed
that
they
would
hold
it
unfairly.
and
of
course
it
was
not
until
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
it
was
found
necessary
to
lay
down
certain
guiding
rules.
i
don't
believe
that
this
general
principle
that
the
states
have
is
unqualified
right
to
pick
qualifications
and
how
anyone
can
put
a
tax,
the
payment
of
a
head
tax
as
a
qualification
for
voting
is
beyond
me.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
it
has
a
connection
with
your
ability
to
properly
discharge
your
duty
as
an
elector.
for
example,
when
you
go
to
the
far
end,
an
idiot,
nobody
pose
as
idiots
being
kept
out
and
if
a
literate
test
is
fairly
administered,
and
certainly
under
the
lassiter
case,
i
don't
think
there's
had
been
in
the
question
that
a
literacy
test
is
an
actual
test
of
qualifications.
but
the
fact
that
a
man
did
not
pay
a
dollar
and
a
half
head
tax
which
is
the
smallest
tax
at
least
i
know
of
in
virginia
unless
you
get
cigarette
tax
or
something
like
that,
it's
not
by
stretch
of
imagination
connected
with
literacy.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
still
wouldn't
be
a
test.
it
wouldn't
be
a
test
for
disqualifications.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
permissible
because
the
--
what
about
the
man
who
can't
pay
it.
the
man
who
can't
pay
it
would
be
barred
from
voting
and
even
if
the
person
who
couldn't
pay
was
excluded,
i
would
say
it
would
be
improper
because
there's
nothing
to
do
with
qualifications.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
fund
goes
--
a
part
of
it
goes
for
education
and
the
rest
of
it
goes
to
general
funds
and
they
admit
they
don't
raise
money
with
it.
i
mean
in
--
in
this
day
and
age
and
the
--
the
main
reason,
mr.
justice
clark
is
i'm
sure
it's
not
a
tax
revenue
measured.
i'm
not
certain.
i
haven't
checked
but
i
don't
know
of
a
single
tax
in
the
world
that
stayed
the
same
rate
for
75
years,
not
on
this
day
and
age,
i
don't.
i
don't
know
whether
you
take
judicial
notice
of
it
but
i
could.
i
think
it's
quite
obvious
that
it's
merely
a
tax
on
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
vote.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
sir,
i
don't
know.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
not
too
sure
that
the
reason
for
the
property
test
applied
today,
that
the
property
test
came
about
before
we
had
public
education,
that's
what
started
it.
and
they
assume
that
a
man
who
didn't
own
property
couldn't
afford
to
send
his
child
to
a
private
school.
that
was
the
theory
in
the
old
property
case
and
that
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
submit
it
does
not
because
under
this
rule
unless
the
man
was
convicted
for
nonpayment
of
taxes,
a
resident
of
virginia
could
refuse
to
pay
every
single
other
tax
to
the
tune
of
say
$10,000
and
he
could
vote
providing
he
paid
the
dollar
and
a
half
one
on
time.
so
it's
--
i
don't
see
that
there
really
could
be
any
connection
between
the
two.
not
for
the
question
on
the
point
of
qualifications.
it's
just
not
there,
i
don't
see
it.
and
the
defense
--
the
only
defense
i
see
is
the
theory
that
the
state
can
set
up
any
qualification.
well,
this
is
not
a
qualification.
yes.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
1870,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
1870,
i
would
draw
mine
at
the
time
we
began
to
get
into
the
field
of
public
education.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
breedlove
might
have
been.
the
breedlove
case,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
it.
first,
i
bet
it
took
the
opinion
in
itself
starts
off
where
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
head
tax
or
a
poll
tax,
and
i
agree,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
and
then
it
goes
straight
from
that
to
the
point
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
making
that
a
qualification
for
voting.
but
you
read
the
briefs.
the
point
was
they
claim
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
nineteenth
amendment,
this
discrimination
on
sex.
and
there
was
a
point
like
that
involved.
none
of
these
points
were
in
breedlove.
but
the
opinion
does,
i
submit,
stand
in
our
way.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
the
middle
of
the
--
well
i
can
only
go
up
to
the
--
through
the
19th
century.
i
could
see
basis
for
property
qualifications
but
i
don't
see
it
now
in
the
--
anytime
in
the
present.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
any
state.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
state
it
is.
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
the
race
of
the
person
is,
for
my
argument.
i'm
not
saying
the
other
argument
is
not
valid.
but
in
my
argument,
it's
improper
to
qualify
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
ra
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
might
have
been
that
a
poor
person
would
not
have
the
necessary
information.
but
today
with
the
mass
media
of
communication,
the
poor
person
doesn't
even
have
to
have
a
television
set,
he
goes
and
look
at
somebody
else's
and
hear
of
all
of
the
discussion
of
the
pending
issues
of
an
election.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mine
is
--
is
equal
protection
and
due
process
and
i
--
the
two
i
think
spill
over
because
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
seem
to
make
it
clear
that
the
right
to
vote
without
an
unreasonable
classification
denying
you
the
right
or
diluting
your
right
or
gerrymandering
you
a
right,
or
rights
that
are
similar
to
and
on
the
same
level
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
--
the
whole
point
is
i
don't
see
how
qualifications
are
any
more
important
than
diluting
the
vote.
the
cases
do
involve
dilution
of
the
vote.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
from
the
democracy
when
it
was
set
up,
when
our
government
was
set
up.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
federal
government
was
set
up.
that's
my
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it'd
be
certainly
contrary
to
breedlove,
it
wouldn't
be
contrary
to
the
other
ones.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
wilkins
was,
i
think,
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
the
--
take
the
gerrymandering
case
and
cases
of
that
type.
that
was
dilution
of
the
vote.
this
is
--
this
is
dilution
plus
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
rash
is
on
the
qualification
case
but
that
was
limited
to
more
or
less
to
equal
protection
and
it
was
ruled
that
this
was
an
unfair
classification
because
he
didn't
have
a
chance,
the
soldier
did
demonstrate
that
he
was
a
resident.
but
it
was
equal
protection,
clearly
equal
protection.
and
that
was
qualification
definitely.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
classic
was
stopped
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
the
--
dilution
of
it.
the
rule
was
that
you
were
diluting
his
vote.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
was
based
on
race,
clearly
on
race
alright
up
through
terry
and
adams.
they
were
all
clearly
based
on
race.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
with
the
argument,
i'm
broad
as
it
is.
they
would
apply
to
the
argument
that
this
is
a
direct
discrimination
against
negroes
which
is
made
in
the
case
that
follows
but
for
this
broad
argument
i'm
making
which
i
submit
is
in
this
day
and
time
i
think
is
the
one
that
we
should
have
to
get
the
thing
settled
once
and
for
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
even
if
you
follow
carrington
and
rash
and
gray
and
sanders,
wesberry
and
sanders,
any
of
the
recent
cases
you
--
i
think
breedlove
stands
in
the
way
of
them.
but
i
--
the
only
difficulty
is
that
i
hate
to
--
well
of
course
to
urge
a
case
to
be
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
the
position
we
take
is
that
the
points
were
just
not
raised
in
breedlove.
we've
gone
through
the
--
every
brief
that's
filed
in
that
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
the
broad
language
is
one,
that
the
poll
tax
is
a
valid
tax.
that
we
don't
question.
and
then
the
broad
language
is
that
ergo,
it
can
be
used
because
the
right
to
vote
comes
from
the
state
and
not
the
federal
government.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
it
hardly
any
difference,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
do
know
that
there
is
some
--
i
just
happen
to
know
that
they
have
them
for
certain
bond
issues
and
things
like
that.
in
some
states
they
still
exist.
but
i
frankly
--
i
don't
know
in
general.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know
i
can't
answer
if
i
say
it's
not
in
this
case,
which
is
the
answer
i'd
like
to
make.
but
i
believe
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
the
state
could
possibly
show
a
relationship
between
property
ownership
and
ability
to
exercise
the
right
of
an
elector
but
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
shown.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
tried
to,
mr.
justice
white,
i
tried
to
leave
the
point
open
that
perhaps
the
state
could
show
it
but
i
don't
believe
there
(voice
overlap).
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
those
local
elections,
those
town
maybe
but
i
don't
know
about
general
vermont,
instead.
i
can
find
it
out
later.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
know
they
have
it
for
the
town
meeting.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
i
said
there
is
a
possibility
that
some
state
could
show
that
there
was
a
connection
between
ownership
of
property
because
i
don't
like
to
cross
bridges
until
i
get
there
but
i
frankly
don't
believe
any
state
can
show
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
do.
but
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
for
example,
i
would
be
personally
hard
pushed
to
sustain
a
property
qualification
meaning
real
property
because
from
age
21
until
now,
i've
never
owned
any
real
property.
now,
i
--
i
don't
know
how
good
an
elector
i
am
but
that's
what
i
see.
i
just
don't
believe
it
but
my
basic
argument
is
that
even
if
some
other
qualification
can
be
shown
to
have
relevancy,
you
can't
show
tax
as
irrelevance.
there
is
no
relevancy
could
be
putting
a
tax
on.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
absolutely.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
yes
sir,
absolutely
a
due
process
argument.
i
say
that
if
the
multimillionaire
gets
his
tax
bill
and
draws
a
line
through
the
dollar
and
a
half
and
says
that's
it,
he
has
the
right
to
tender
himself
and
he
has
the
right
to
file
his
lawsuit.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
is
in
the
first
amendment
area.
it
is
not
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
expression.
it's
in
the
same
area
because
it's
very
little
use
in
picketing
if
you
can't
vote.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
there's
no
difference
at
all
except
that
he
has
to
purchase
his
tax
receipt
six
months
at
a
time,
it's
worst,
if
i
get
your
question
correctly.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
i
see.
they
would
be
very
close.
i
don't
see
much
difference
in
it.
suppose
a
man
didn't
pay
any
taxes
and
just
refused
to,
perfectly
able
to
but
just
refused
to,
i
could
very
well
conclude
that
he
was
not
a
responsible
citizen
or
a
responsible
voter.
but
he
would
be
denied
of
his
vote
very
simply.
he
would
be
convicted
with
good
due
process
for
not
paying
his
taxes.
that's
how
he
lose
his
vote.
but
you
couldn't
--
the
state
could
not
deny
him
his
right
to
vote
solely
because
he
didn't
pay
taxes.
because
it's
--
there's
no
way
of
getting
around
it.
and
the
turnstile
thing
is
--
is
more
aggravated.
some
of
us
--
i
don't
know
about
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
know
sometime
you're
staying
on
the
line
waiting
for
those
tokens
up
in
new
york,
it's
quite
a
while.
but
with
his,
it's
six
months.
you've
got
to
buy
your
token
six
months
in
advance.
and
i
perfectly
--
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
the
tax
receipt,
whatever
kind
of
tax
receipt
it
is.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
say
he
meet
any
qualification
for
his
voting.
maybe
he
couldn't
pay
it.
maybe
he
was
unable
to
pay
them.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
a
qualification
for
voting.
he
might
be
the
most
intelligent
man
in
the
--
in
the
world.i
--
the
real
problem
we
have
is
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he's
in
jail,
that
takes
care
of
that
when
he
gets
out.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
sure
about
when
those
cases
come
up
what
position
i'm
going
to
take
or
whether
you
can
deny
him
of
his
citizenship
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
he's
a
convicted
felon
who
has
had
full
due
process
of
law.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
--
yes
sir.
and
in
addition
to
that,
if
he's
a
good
man
and
a
responsible
citizen,
he's
normally
pardoned.
and
his
right
to
vote
is
restored
but
the
failure
to
pay
the
poll
tax
for
that
year,
there's
no
pardon
involved
in
that.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
mention
is
that
the
state
tried
to
justify
this
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
single
and
objective
method
of
determining
whether
a
prospective
voter
has
enough
interest
and
intelligence
to
be
a
fit
participant
in
the
electoral
process.
and
i
think
that
point
was
taken
cared
of
fully
in
the
harman
case.
it's
difficult
to
see
how
any
tax
charged
upon
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
can
ever
be
any
good.
and
finally,
nor
can
the
poll
tax
be
defended
as
a
method
of
raising
revenue
for
legitimate
purposes
of
the
state.
and
i
merely
mentioned
that
because
the
state
put
so
much
stress
to
it
and
completely
ignore
its
own
decisions
and
i
think
the
facts
as
were
brought
out
in
a
question
earlier,
demonstrate
fully
that
there's
no
connection
or
whatsoever
between
the
collection
of
the
taxes
and
the
voting
itself.
and
i
would
say
that
the
united
states
government
pursuant
to
the
1965
voting
act
has
appeared
here
as
amicus
with
the
strong
urging
of
the
government
that
the
poll
tax
involved
in
this
case
be
declared
unconstitutional
once
and
for
all
so
that
the
voters
who
got
their
rights
for
the
first
time
in
the
1965
act
can
exercise
in
this
year
without
any
problem
at
all.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
we
are
the
--
of
course,
when
this
was
all
going
on,
i
was
up
and
fully
square
but
as
i
have
read
the
record,
it's
clear
that
the
department
was
urgently
considering
it
to
be
in
this
case
either
way.
and
the
interest
of
the
government
is
not
solely
dependent
on
the
act
of
congress.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
i
didn't
come
for
that.
