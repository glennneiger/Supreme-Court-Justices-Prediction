mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
have
been
convicted
of
violating
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
18
u.s.c.
371
and
under
this
court's
limited
grant
of
certiorari,
three
separate
grounds
for
reversal
are
presently
being
asserted.
petitioner's
contentions
have
been
presented
in
their
briefs
and
in
ours
and
in
petitioner's
oral
argument
in
the
following
sequence.
first,
they've
argued
that
the
indictment
under
which
they
were
charged
was
defective
in
that
it
accused
them
of
having
defraud,
conspire
to
defraud
of
the
united
states
whereas
the
body
of
the
indictment
alleged
a
conspiracy
which
did
not
require
for
defraud,
in
other
words
a
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense
against
the
united
states.
second,
petitioners
have
argued
that
their
convictions
are
unconstitutional
because
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
imposed
the
underlying
affidavit
requirement
was
an
impermissible
exercise
of
legislative
power.
and
their
third
contention
has
been
that
their
trial
was
improperly
conducted
in
that
procedural
error
was
committed
with
respect
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
government
witnesses.
before
discussing
each
of
these
three
contentions,
i
think
it
is
important
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
difference
between
each
of
them
in
terms
of
the
result
--
of
the
resulting
judgments
if
any
of
them
should
be
sustained.
taking
first
the
grand
jury
contention,
if
there
were
a
reversal
on
that
ground
alone
that
would
mean
at
most
a
new
trial
under
the
present
indictment.
and
as
i
will
try
later
to
explain
our
view
of
course
that
a
remand
would
be
sufficient,
but
at
most
it
would
mean
a
new
trial
under
the
present
indictment.
it
would
leave
undetermined
the
question
whether
the
indictment
is
valid
and
whether
a
prosecution
such
as
this
one
is
constitutionally
permissible.
the
constitutional
challenge
is
the
other
extreme
because
that
would,
if
successful,
bar
any
further
prosecution
of
these
petitioners
for
the
offense
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
the
first
ground
asserted
by
the
petitioner
is
the
alleged
flaw
in
the
indictment
caused
for
it
to
have
a
different
result
and
that
the
evidence
could
then
be
represented
to
a
new
grand
jury
which
despite
the
lapse
of
the
limitations
period
would
be
entitled
to
enter
a
fresh
indictment
and
then
under
charging
an
offense
to
commit
to
united
states
under
18
u.s.c
3288
which
authorizes
re-indictment
in
case
of
a
flaw
in
the
indictment
after
the
lapse
of
limitations
period
and
there
would
then
be
a
new
trial.
now
i
call
these
differences
to
the
court's
attention
because
it
appears
to
us
that
from
the
vantage
point
of
sound
judicial
administration,
the
three
issues
before
the
court
might
well
be
considered
in
the
order
in
which
they
would
most
probably
obviate
any
need
for
unnecessary
duplication
or
repetitive
later
trials
since
the
--
both
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
statutory
questions
would
not
be
mooted
simply
by
remanding
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
in
other
words,
basic
to
the
right
to
try
these
petitioners
is
the
constitutional
challenge
and
if
as
we
believe
there's
no
merit
to
that
constitutional
claim,
it
would
nonetheless
be
vain
to
retry
them
under
the
present
indictment
if
there
was
still
a
cloud
over
the
question
whether
they
could
be
tried
for
conspiracy-to-defraud.
consequently,
if
the
courts
please,
i
should
like
to
discuss
first
the
constitutional
claim
which
really
our
basic
proposition
is,
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
claim
at
all
or
at
least
that
the
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue
would
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
petitioner's
convictions.
then
second,
the
alleged
flaw
in
the
indictment,
and
finally,
the
district
judge's
treatment
of
the
motions
regarding
the
witnesses'
grand
jury
testimony.
now
we
particularly
urge
that
the
questions
be
considered
in
this
order,
because
the
convictions
presently
before
the
court
are
the
result
of
a
second
trial
of
these
petitioners
and
it
is
now
almost
ten
years
since
the
indictment
was
filed.
our
position
of
course
is,
that
none
of
the
three
contentions
warrants
reversal
of
the
judgments
of
conviction.
that
we
also
believe
that
it
would
not
be
in
the
interest
either
of
petitioners
or
of
the
government
to
remand
this
case
or
in
the
interest
of
judicial
administration
and
the
conservation
of
judicial
resources
to
remand
this
case
without
--
if
the
case
will
remand
for
a
new
trial
without
removing
the
clouds
that
are
presented
by
the
constitutional
issue
and
by
the
statutory
claim.
i
turn
therefore
first
to
the
constitutional
issue.
the
taft-hartley
amendments
of
1947
added
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
section
9
(h),
was
in
turn
repealed
the
1959
with
the
landrum-griffin
act
of
that
year.
that
provision
states
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
shall
make
no
investigation
and
issue
no
complaint
on
behalf
of
members
of
the
union
or
on
behalf
of
the
union
itself,
unless
that
union
or
its
members
or
its
officers
have
filed
with
the
board
affidavits
of
each
of
the
officers
stating
that
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
affiliated
with
the
party.
petitioners
were
convicted
on
a
one-count
indictment
which
charged
them
with
having
conspired
in
violation
of
the
general
conspiracy
statute
to
defraud
the
national
labor
relations
board
by
filing
--
first,
by
filing
false
affidavits,
second,
obtaining
a
certificate
of
compliance
and
then
third,
using
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
with
knowledge
of
the
underlying
fraud.
their
claim
is
that
because
section
9
(h)
is
allegedly
unconstitutional,
that
constitutional
infirmity
vitiates
their
convictions.
our
principal
position
is
that
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h)
does
not
affect
the
validity
of
petitioner's
convictions
at
all.
it
is
important
in
this
regard
to
consider
what
section
9
(h)
commands
to
the
extent
that
it
has
a
command
and
what
the
petitioners
are
convicted
of
having
done.
section
9
(h)
conditioned
the
availability
of
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
the
filing
of
non-communist
affidavits
by
union
officers.
it
said
to
officers
in
effect,
if
you
want
your
union
to
enjoy
the
facilities
of
the
labor
board,
you
must
be
prepared
to
file
non-communist
affidavits.
to
the
extent
that
section
9
(h)
could
be
violated
at
all,
it
can
be
said
something
violated,
it
had
a
self-executing
sense.
in
other
words,
if
officers
violated
it,
if
they've
failed
to
file
affidavits,
their
union
was
barred
from
enjoying
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
but
the
petitioners
were
not
charged
in
having
violated
section
9
(h)
which
could
be
done
by
not
filing
affidavits
with
the
board.
what
they
were
charged
with
was
a
separate
and
distinct
offense
which
was
conspiring
to
defraud
by
filing
false
statements
with
the
government
upon
which
governmental
action
was
taken.
their
constitutional
claim,
if
it
were
sound,
meant
really
nothing
more
that
they
were
entitled
to
challenge
section
9
(h)
by
ignoring
the
statute,
by
not
filing
any
affidavits,
but
it
did
not
mean
that
they
could
lawfully
commit
an
entirely
separate
and
distinct
offense.
assume
for
example,
hypothetically,
that
petitioners
on
this
record
had
decided
instead
of
that
--
instead
of
filing
false
affidavits,
they
would
prevent
the
impact
of
section
9
(h)
upon
their
union
by
bribing
the
official
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
who
was
in
charged
of
the
records
of
the
board
with
regard
to
such
affidavits,
and
bribing
him
to
have
him
alter
the
records
in
order
to
reflect
that
they
had
filed
the
affidavits.
it
seems
entirely
clear
to
us
that
it
would
not
be
a
defense
to
bribery
prosecution
in
such
circumstances
for
them
to
say
“oh
we
didn't
have
to
file
any
affidavits
at
all.”
their
lawful
response
to
the
--
to
the
requirement
that
they
file
affidavits
if
they
had
a
constitutional
challenge
to
that
requirement,
was
not
to
file
the
affidavits
and
to
do
what
the
plaintiffs
did
in
american
communication
association
versus
doud,
which
is
the
case
in
which
this
court
did
pass
in
a
proper
procedural
context
on
the
constitution
--
very
same
constitutional
challenge
make
here
by
petitioners.
in
other
words
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
union
and
the
officers
used
to
file
affidavit
--
and
then
when
the
national
labor
relations
board
failed
to
place
the
union's
name
in
a
representation
election,
they've
brought
suit
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
against
the
board
to
require
the
board
to
make
the
appropriate
measures,
taking
appropriate
steps.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
mr.
justice
black,
yes.
that
the
proper
response
in
a
--
in
our
legal
system
is
to
challenge
the
obligation,
not
by
committing
another
offense,
a
distinct
offense
which
is
filing
a
false
statement
or
committing
fraud
but
by
not
answering
at
all.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
well,
we
think
yes.
we
think
that
--
just
as
they
could
be
tried,
just
as
people
in
this
position
could
be
tried
for
any
other
crime.
i
think
really
an
answer
with
(voice
overlap)
response
to
your
particular
crime
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
their
response
to
the
unlawful
inquiry
would
be
not
to
answer
and
then,
if
it
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
think
mr.
justice
black,
it
might
will
be
a
defense
if
you
say
if
they
--
will
require
to
answer
through
fear
or
through
some
form
of
coercion
but
if
they
have
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
their
obligation
is
just
not
to
answer,
not
--
and
they
may
not
answer
falsely
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
mr.
justice
black
because
we
think
that
they've
committed
a
separate
offense,
we
think
that
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
is
our
argument.
general
taylor
has
said
that
our
contention
is
in
line
with
your
question
mr.
justice
black
that
if
it
--
if
a
government
inquiry
is
authorized
by
statute,
although
it
may
be
claimed
to
be
unconstitutional,
then
if
a
person
who's
asked
that
question,
he
can
be
put
to
the
choice
of
either
answering
it
or
challenging
it
by
not
answering
it,
but
may
not
answer
falsely.
now
we
think
that's
--
that's
precisely
right,
he
may
not
answer
falsely.
he
may
not
--
he
may
not
shoot
the
interrogator.
he
may
not
bribe
the
interrogator
and
we
think
he
may
also
not
answer
falsely.
each
one
of
those
is
a
separate
offense
which
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
under
this
statute
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
no
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
that
they
didn't
answer
but
then
he
would
have
the
constitutional
claim
then
he
could
assert
his
constitutional
claim
and
we
think
under
our
system,
that's
what
a
--
that's
what
somebody
who
was
subject
to
an
unconstitutional
request
must
do.
he
must
challenge
it
by
not
answering
or
by
taking
whatever
steps,
whatever
lawful
steps,
the
minimum
steps
in
terms
if
not
committing
other
offenses
that
are
available
to
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
would
have
been
possible
--
it
would
not
have
been
--
it
wouldn't
have
been
void,
i
don't
think
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
think
it
would
have
been
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir
because
it
was
a
false
statement
and
because
the
petitioners
could
have
raised
their
constitutional
claim
by
simply
not
filing
any
statement
and
it
did
give
them,
the
fact
that
the
statute
might
be
unconstitutional
did
not
give
them
a
light
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
a
--
under
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
under
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
statute
which
is
what
this
prosecution
was
brought
under,
i
think
the
statement
would
have
to
be
material
because
fraud
would
have
been
--
would
be
required.
and
that
means
that
the
false
statement
would
have
to
be
material
to
something
which
the
filers
are
attempting
to
obtain.
under
1001
on
the
--
well,
i'm
sorry
i
think
i
would
have
to
insert
on
1001.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
this
is
the
conspiracy
to
violate
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
we
think
the
--
our
argument
in
this
regard
is
really
--
makes
this
case
very
similar
for
example
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
williams,
which
involved
a
--
the
question,
the
validity
of
a
perjury
charge,
made
against
a
witness
who
had
testified
allegedly
falsely
in
a
criminal
trial
on
an
indictment
which
did
not
as
this
court
held
state
of
federal
offense.
now
presumably
the
court
in
that
case,
in
the
williams
case,
did
not
have
in
one
sense
jurisdiction.
they
couldn't
proceed
to
try
that
case
and
yet,
witnesses
who
appeared
before
it,
if
they
were
to
make
that
kind
of
a
challenge,
certainly
couldn't
even
contest
the
court's
jurisdiction
before
they
were
able
to
testify.
and
yet
this
court
held
in
williams
that
that
did
not
give
them
the
option
of
committing
the
entirely
distinct
and
separate
crime
of
perjury.
the
kapp
and
kay
cases
are
not
as
general
taylor
suggested,
separate
branches
of
our
argument,
they
were
all
--
we
believe
they
were
all
welded
in,
they're
part
of
the
very
same
proposition.
in
kapp,
the
defendants
had
been
charged
with
conspiring
to
defraud
the
united
states
by
submitting
false
claims
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act.
presumably,
those
claims
were
nullity.
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
time
the
case
--
that
the
validity
of
that
indictment
was
determined
by
the
district
court.
and
yet
this
court
held
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
was
unconstitutional,
that
did
not
give
the
defendants
in
that
case
a
license
to
commit
a
separate
and
distinct
crime.
essentially,
at
the
heart
of
our
argument
is
the
very
same
proposition
we
think
--
or
the
very
same
broad
principle
which
is
--
which
underlies
this
court's
decision
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
which
is
that
there
are
certain
lawful
responses
which
may
be
made
to
demands
or
requests
of
courts
or
governmental
agencies
which
may
be
impermissible,
whether
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
whether
because
of
a
constitutional
challenge,
and
the
permissible
responses
are
not
to
be
the
--
either
not
to
respond
to
the
demand
or
to
take
whatever
minimum
steps
are
necessary
in
order
to
present
the
constitutional
claim
in
appropriate
litigation.
but
a
constitutional
challenge
does
not,
under
our
system,
give
the
person
who
is
subject
to
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
demand,
the
option
of
committing
a
whole
range
of
--
a
broad
range
of
crimes,
simply
in
order
to
avoid
the
impact
of
what
he
claims
is
an
unconstitutional
request
or
demand
and
that
we
think
is
what
is
in
issue
here.
if
the
government
--
if
the
labor
board
under
section
9
(h)
did
not
have
the
power
to
demand
these
affidavits,
petitioners'
option
was
not
to
submit
affidavits.
they
could
not
bribe
the
labor
board
employee
nor
could
they
submit
false
affidavits.
a
court
which
has
no
jurisdiction
may
not
under
the
united
mine
workers
case,
cavalierly
disobey.
an
agency
which
has
cons
--
no
constitutional
power,
may
not
under
this
court's
decision
in
kapp
be
cheated.
a
court
which
is
trying
to
charge
which
did
not
amount
to
a
federal
crime
may
not
under
williams
be
lied
to
and
there
are
many
cases
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
or
considerable
number
of
case
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
which
involved
grand
jury's
calling
witnesses
without
informing
them
of
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
then
putting
questions
to
them.
in
one
sense,
the
questions
certainly
in
those
cases
are
unauthorized.
the
witness,
who
is
ignorant
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
presumably
doesn't
have
the
option
of
refusing
to
answer.
he
doesn't
know
what
it
is
he
can
do
and
what
his
lawful
rights
are.
and
yet,
courts
have
held
that
a
false
answer
under
those
circumstances
amounts
to
perjury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
of
any
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
it
might
be
different
in
first
amendment
case
if
possibly
mr.
justice
black.
in
other
words,
possibly
the
mere
obligation
of
answering
of
any
kind
if
a
witness
is
ignorant,
certainly
if
he's
ignorant
of
his
various
options,
he
ought
not
in
any
way
to
be
penalized
for
what
it
is
that
he's
answering.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
even
if
it
involved
first
amendment
rights,
the
petitioners
had
the
advice
of
counsel,
they
knew
what
it
is
that
their
choices
were
and
indeed,
i
don't
think
that
there's
probably
no
doubt
that
they
consciously
chose
to
file
affidavits
rather
than
not
file
them
and
make
a
constitutional
challenge
in
an
appropriate
proceeding
because
they
knew
that
it
--
they
may
be
appropriate
challenge,
it
would
then
--
have
been
rejected
under
the
douds
case.
so
that
they
--
they
made
in
this
case
a
very
knowing
choice
when
they
determined
that
they
would
file
false
affidavits
rather
than
not
filing
the
affidavits
at
all.
i
think
it's
possible
that
in
certain
first
amendment
context
if
a
--
if
they
--
a
person
who
has
asked
the
question
does
not
have
the
advice
of
counsel
and
does
not
know
what
his
options
are
it
might
very
well
be
unfair
or
possibly
constitutionally
impermissible
then
to
prosecute
him
because
the
answer
turns
out
to
be
false,
but
i
don't
think
that's
this
case.
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim,
i
would
like
to
make
these
two
points,
after
noting.
first
of
course,
that
the
ground
that
the
majority
of
the
court
or
in
douds
determine
that
section
9
(h)
was
constitutional
or
was
not
a
bill
of
attainder,
was
of
course
pro
tanto
overruled
in
archie
brown.
in
douds,
the
court
adverted
to
the
fact
that
9
(h)
was
not
a
bill
of
attainder
because
it
operated
only
prospectively
and
to
that
extent,
this
court
has
overruled
that
portion
under
douds
holding
in
the
archie
brown
case.
however,
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
the
bill
of
attainder
cases
and
particularly
in
the
lovett
case,
there
was
heavy
emphasis
placed
by
the
court
on
the
question
of
whether
what
congress
was
doing
amounted
to
punishment
and
it
was
held
in
lovett
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
sanction
was
not
a
criminal
one
it
nonetheless
did
amount
to
punishment.
in
this
case,
in
9
(h)
we
believe
that
the
court
in
douds
held
that
it
was
the
effect
of
the
affidavit
requirement
was
a
discouragement
and
that's
the
court's
language
and
we
submit
that
to
that
extent,
9
(h)
is
distinguishable
from
the
successor
statute
in
section
504
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
because
it
is
merely
a
discouragement
and
this
court
in
a
footnote
in
the
aptheker
case,
made
that
very
distinction
between
douds
and
the
statute
that
was
before
them
in
aptheker.
and
we
think
that
that
would
be
a
ground
for
distinguishing
9
(h)
from
the
archie
brown
statute
in
bill
of
attainder
terms.
with
regard
to
general
taylor's
reference
to
this
court's
recent
decision
in
elfbrandt,
of
course
this
indictment
did
not
allege
specific
intent
because
what
petitioners
were
being
charged
with
was
not
mere
membership
in
a
communist
party
or
anything
that
would
have
required
a
showing
of
specific
intent.
they
were
charged
with
having
lied
in
the
statements
of
the
government.
they
said
to
the
government
that
they
had
--
they
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
only
material
question
is
whether
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party
and
whether
that
statement
if
they
were
not
was
a
lie.
consequently
specific
intent
in
the
indictment
or
in
the
proof
was
a
--
would
have
been
any
relevance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
right.
we
think
it
must
be
knowing
because
otherwise
the
statement
isn't
false,
presumably
somebody
who
doesn't
know
that
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
he
said
that
he's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
real
reason
they
weren't
charged
mr.
chief
justice
is,
that
there
were
some
doubt
--
apparently
the
time
that
the
indictment
was
drafted
whether
an
indictment
charging
them
both
with
conspiracy-to-defraud
and
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
might
not
be
duplicitous.
now
of
course,
there
have
been
many
cases
in
this
court
and
other
courts
that
have
held
that
it
would
not
be
duplicitous,
but
i
think
(voice
overlap)
access
or
cautions
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
next
with
regard
to
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
if
i
may
on
the
right
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
i'm
just
trying
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
with
regard
to
the
petitioner's
second
contention
which
is
precisely
that
they
should
have
been
charged
with
18
u.s.c.
1001
rather
than
with
a
conspiracy-to-defraud.
we
think
the
short
answer
is
that
the
indictment
on
its
face
charges
more
than
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001.
it
charges
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001,
plus,
further
acts
committed
in
pursuance
of
a
fraud
on
the
united
states.
and
for
that
reason
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
that
if
the
petitioner's
crime
were
properly
defined,
it
would
really
be
--
they
conspired
to
violate
1001
and
they
conspire
it
to
defraud.
it
was
one
conspiracy
but
its
objectives
were
--
went
beyond
nearly
filing
false
affidavits.
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
in
the
sense
that
9
(h)
has
the
sanction
of
not
providing
board
itself
(voice
overlap)
it's
not
if
you
don't
violate.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
white,
because
all
that
--
all
that
9
(h)
does
is
it
tells
the
board,
you
may
not
offer
your
facilities
to
such
and
such
unions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
unless
something
happened.
so
i
don't
think
anybody
--
any
individual
can
really
violate
9
(h)
in
that
sense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
--
i
think
under
the
perjury
statute,
this
would
have
to
be
before
tribunal
competent
jurisdiction.
i'm
not
sure
whether
affidavits
filed
on
those
circumstances
could
be
perjurious.
and
i
think
--
in
addition
mr.
justice
douglas
that
9
(h)
provide
that
the
false
statements,
18
u.s.c.
1001
will
apply
to
these
statements.
so
even
a
perjury
were
available,
i
think
that
really
would
be
no
occasion
ever
to
use
a
perjury
charge.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
indictment
mr.
justice
fortas,
did
not
refer
to
that
one.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
precisely
our
position.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right,
we're
saying
no
matter
how
that's
decided,
it
does
not
affect
these
convictions
just
as
it
would
not
affect
the
bribery
conviction
or
result
conviction
on
--
if
it
were
--
if
it
that
would
be
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
we
think
that
the
phase
of
the
indictment
as
a
matter
of
fact,
shows
that
what
was
involved
here
was
much
more
than
a
conspiracy
merely
to
violate
1001
or
to
file
false
affidavit.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
don't
mention
1001
but
well
--
it
was
-
in
the
course,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
course
of
committing
their
greater
conspiracy
that
conspirators
we
think
violated
--
could
very
well
been
charged
with
having
violated
1001.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
were
not
charged
with
that,
but
the
indictment,
if
i
can
just
point
to
pages
2
and
3
of
the
indictment,
it's
entirely
clear
from
the
face
of
the
indictment
that
there
were
three
parts
to
the
conspiracy.
only
the
first
part
of
the
conspiracy
as
alleged
was
the
filing
of
false
affidavits.
the
second
part,
and
that's
alleged
in
an
entirely
separate
paragraph
which
appears
on
page
3,
was
that
the
cons
--
the
conspirators,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
others,
induced
the
labor
board
to
issue
certificates
of
compliance
based
on
these
false
affidavits.
and
the
third
paragraph
is
that
the
conspirators
then
may
over
a
period
of
use
of
the
board's
facilities
knowing
that
the
underlying
affidavits
had
been
false
and
fraudulent.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
can
think
of
the
--
i
can
think
of
none
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
could
have
taken
either
one
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
i
think
it's
possible
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
think
it
more
accurately
describes
what
the
conspirators
did
really.
they
didn't.
they
--
had
they
--
had
they've
been
violating
1001,
then
presumably
and
arguably
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right,
but
i
think
that
can
only
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
same
penalty,
i
think
arguably
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
they
might
have
contend
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
they
might
then
have
contended
and
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
sound
but
they
might
have
contended
that
their
conspiracies
were
separate
conspiracies
then
for
each
year.
they
might
have
argued
well
you
can't
charge
this
with
one
overall
conspiracy
when
each
year
we've
been
conspiring
to
file
false
statement.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
we
don't
think
we
have
to
cut
into
any
--
any
statement
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh
no,
because
the
bridges
case
which
is
i
think
the
only
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
the
bridges
case
was
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
a
case
in
which
the
question
was
with
the
war-time
suspension
of
limitations
act
which
extended
a
period
of
limitations
for
fraud
against
the
united
states
would
apply
to
a
case
in
which
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
was
charged
in
which
the
whole
conspiracy-to-defraud
consisted
only
of
the
commission
of
substantive
offenses,
various
substantive
offenses
which
is
making
a
false
statement
to
a
naturalization
officer,
obtaining
a
false
naturalization
certificate.
and
that
was
all
that
could
--
all
that
the
conspiracy
there
charged
involved.
it's
distinguishable
from
this
case
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
the
court
was
entirely
clear
on
bridges
that
it
was
construing
the
war-time
suspension
of
limitations
act
which
the
court
there
said
was
--
should
be
given
very
conservative
construction,
what
amounts
to
a
fraud
on
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
the
war-time
suspension
of
limitations
act,
is
not
the
very
same
thing
as
would
be
a
fraud
for
purposes
of
the
conspiracy
to
defraud
statute.
really,
i
think
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
bridges
was
the
fact
that
almost
any
conspiracy-to-defraud
encompasses
lots
of
subs
--
commission
of
substantive
offenses.
an
author
of
the
law
review
article
in
--
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
has
maintained
that
that
--
all
of
the
cases
involving
conspiracy-to-defraud
which
have
been
brought
could
be
brought
as
conspiracy
to
commit
substantive
offenses
case.
and
yet
in
this
case,
we
believe
there
was
more
to
the
conspiracy
than
merely
the
commission
of
the
substantive
offense
of
violating
1001,
and
that
we
think
is
the
second
distinction
from
bridges.
in
bridges,
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
encompassed
and
nothing
more
just
the
commission
of
various
substantive
offenses.
in
this
case,
the
second
and
third
parts
of
conspiracy
alleged
in
the
indictment
didn't
involve
any
substantive
offense
at
all.
there
is
no
substantive
offense
that
says
that
you're
committing
an
offense
against
the
united
states
if
you
induce
the
labor
board
to
issue
to
you
a
certificate
of
compliance
based
on
somebody
else's
or
on
your
own,
false
non-communist
affidavit.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
say
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment
amount
to
a
violation
of
1001
and
more,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
our
first
answer
of
course
is
that
if
we
could
properly
charge
it
then,
even
if
they
weren't
prejudiced
that
there
was
--
its
lawful
prejudice.
i
mean,
we
think
that
this
is
really
what
--
this
really
amounted
to
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
not
merely
to
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
and
our
second
response
is,
that
the
prejudice
exists
in
any
case
in
which
a
defendant
is
charged
with
a
greater
offense
and
convicted
of
a
lesser.
now
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
then
we
think
that
the
error
was
not
prejudicial
and
that
that
--
because,
the
petitioners
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
knew
exactly
from
the
fact
spelled
out
very
carefully
indict
--
in
the
indictment,
what
they
were
being
charged
with.
and
at
most,
what
they
were
charged
with
was
violating
1001
and
going
on
and
doing
other
things.
if
they
were
convicted
only
of
violating
1001,
then
they
are
prejudiced
is
no
greater
than
being
convicted
of
a
lesser
included
offense
in
--
when
they're
charged
with
a
greater.
the
judge
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
haven't
seen
the
statute
of
limitations
question
in
petitioner's
brief
really
and
i
really
don't
know
exactly
what
it
would
be.
it
appears
--
it
appears
to
us
really
then
mr.
justice
harlan
that
a
conspiracy
going
lasting
into
a
limitations
period
of
this
sort,
whether
it's
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
or
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
would
involve
the
same
proof,
and
that
we
just
don't
see
that
there's
any
difference
in
terms
of
limitations
between
each
other.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
fraud
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
fraud
was
inducing
the
labor
board
to
issue
on
the
basis
of
false
affidavits,
a
certificate
of
compliance
and
then
using
services
of
the
labor
board
which
under
the
statute,
if
--
let's
assume
constitutional,
the
petitioner
union
was
not
entitled
to.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
(voice
overlap)
not
necessary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
necessarily
mr.
--
it's
possible
it
seems
to
us
to
file
false
statements
under
1001
and
then
go
no
farther.
then
never
--
assuming
--
if
one
union
officer
for
example
may
file
false
statement
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
because
here,
petitioners
did
more.
they
didn't
merely
file
a
false
affidavit.
they
then
went
on
and
tried
to
use
the
false
affidavits
as
a
basis
for
obtaining
--
as
the
a
basis
for
obtaining
benefits
which
they
actively
sought.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
we
could
still
sustain
a
conviction
for
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
right.
well,
i'm
assuming
from
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
we
didn't
prove
that
they
had
any
such
intent
that
they
ever
sought
that
they
just
intended
to
filed
false
affidavits
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
we
think
a
different
--
a
harder
question
would
have
been
presented
which
is
whether
it
would
end
up
in
prejudicial
error
to
allow
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
under
the
indictment
charge
of
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
when
the
proof
amounted
only
to
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001,
which
would
have
been
a
different
and
harder
question.
we
think
the
proof
here
when
it
went
to
the
jury
was
enough
to
sustain
conspiracy-to-defraud.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
then
using
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
now,
then
using
the
labor
board
mr.
justice
black.
its
like
--
if
i
were
to
conspire
with
somebody
else
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
that
--
that's
not
a
separate
offense,
but
that's
exactly
what
the
conspiracy-to-defraud.
mr.
nathan
lewin
except
that
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black,
we
only
--
there's
a
one
count
indictment
and
there's
only
a
single
conspiracy.
we
weren't
seeking
the
accumulate
sentences
like
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
mr.
justice
black,
because
at
that
--
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought
the
statute
9
(h)
was
constitutional
and
it
had
been
held
so
and
--
by
this
court
in
douds
and
i
don't
think
there
was
--
there
--
at
that
time
merely
been
any
thought
that
that
douds
would
be
overruled.
and
the
--
that
the
only
reason
that
this
case
was
brought
under
the
conspiracy
--
under
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
provision,
we
submit
was
that
really
what
the
petitioners
did
in
this
case
was
much
closer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
been
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
i
think.
i
mean
if
--
more
or
so
than
nearly
violations
of
1001,
yes
sir.
although,
even
as
to
that
there
are
cases
--
i
think
we
should
tell
that
if
you
--
if
you
prove
the
conspiracy
you
can
put
in
the
same
evidence
even
if
you
haven't
alleged
--
and
so
--
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
situation
here
is
similar
to
that
which
would
result
for
example
i
and
another
were
to
attempt
to
the
district
of
columbia
of
fraudulent
birth
certificate
for
myself,
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
government
employment
or
a
driver's
license.
now,
when
i
obtained
the
fraudulent
birth
certificate,
i've
committed
one
offense,
but
if
that's
part
of
a
much
larger
scheme
which
is
to
obtain
a
false
certificate
which
will
then
be
used
and
i
then
intend
to
use
it
actively
then
i
committed
a
much
more
--
much
broader
and
more
encompassing
conspiracy
than
merely
obtaining
the
false
certificate.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
black,
because
this
is
one
conspiracy
and
one
count
and
there
was
no
attempt
made
in
this
case
really
either
to
pile
up
sentences
or
to
accumulate
punishments
or
in
any
way
to
fragmentize
what
would
be
a
single
--
a
more
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
couldn't
convict
him
without
proving
that
is
--
that
a
statement
was
false
and
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
and
it
was
required.
mr.
nathan
lewin
haven't
--
we've
gone
--
but
we
did
--
if
we
did
anything
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
without
9
(h).
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
our
position
is
that
we
--
that
even
if
9
(h)
were
unconstitutional
we
could
convict,
yes.
yes
sir.
that
--
that's
what
i'm
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
if
9
(h)
were
not
on
the
books,
of
course
then
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
until
such
time
as
the
labor
board
does
not
have
the
authority
to
demand
these
affidavits,
we
think
those
who
are
subject
to
it
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
sir.
not
as
of
that
time.
the
question
is
of
course,
what
happens
prior
to
the
time
if
the
act
is
declared
unconstitutional
and
it
does
so
under
color
if
you
like
of
constitutional
authority.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they've
--
well,
there
was
testimony
--
well
from
i
think
a
total
of
ten
witnesses,
each
identifying
what
these
petitioners
and
witnesses
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
because
i
think
they
would
all
have
gone
to
the
question
of
whether
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
only
additional
--
really
the
additional
evidence
that
we
got
in
and
if
--
it
cast
an
added
burden
on
this
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
we
were
required
to
prove
fraud.
and
the
only
additional
evidence
that
came
in
as
a
result
to
that
was
the
use
of
that
--
the
use
of
the
labor
board.
mr.
nathan
lewin
candidly,
if
i've
been
told
that
the
reason
was
--
that
there
was
doubt
as
to
whether
both
1001
and
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
could
be
charged
in
the
same
indictment.
and
it
was
because
of
the
fear
of
--
that
this
would
be
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
could
have
taken
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know.
i
can
only
say
it
seems
in
retrospect
it
could
have
been
an
unwise
choice
but
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
unnecessary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
was
not
there.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
distinguish
bridges
mr.
chief
justice
on
two
grounds.
one
--
the
first
ground
is
that
the
bridges
case
was
concerned
as
the
court
made
entirely
clear
that
with
the
construction
of
the
war-time
suspension
of
limitations
act.
it
said
this
was
a
statute
which
had
been
opposed
for
a
very
limited
number
of
cases.
in
other
words
--
and
said
it
was
--
it
should
be
given
conservative
interpretation.
and
the
question
was,
whether
acts
such
as
those
alleged
in
the
indictment
in
bridges,
amounting
to
a
fraud
within
the
meaning
of
that
suspension
of
limitations
act
and
the
court
held
that
they
did
not
amount
to
a
fraud
within
the
meaning
of
that
act.
now
have
the
court
held
as
petitioners
now
contend
that
that
could
not
even
have
amounted
to
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
at
all,
presumably
the
court
could
have
--
or
petitioners
in
that
case
would
have
been
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
altogether
as
they
did
here.
the
court
didn't
dismiss
the
indictment
in
bridges.
it
didn't
say
it
was
--
it
improperly
charges
an
offense.
it
said
only
that
it
did
not
come
with
the
union
suspension
of
limitations
which
that
very
limited
statute
provided.
and
our
second
ground
for
distinguishing
bridges
is
that
on
fact,
bridges
really
did
not
involve
anything
more
than
a
conspiracy
to
commit
three
substantive
offenses
and
there
was
nothing
more
alleged
in
the
conspiracy
count
then
that
the
conspirators
had,
as
part
of
their
conspiracy
committed
each
of
those
three
substantive
offenses.
in
this
case,
the
second
and
third
portions
of
the
conspiracy
are
not
substantive
offenses
at
all.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
it's
properly
charged
them
as
fraud
on
the
united
states
and
not
merely
a
substantive
offense.
in
addition,
we
think
that
it's
entirely
clear
not
only
from
the
first
portion
of
the
indictment
but
from
the
overt
acts
which
are
alleged.
that
much
more
was
charged
in
the
indictment
than
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001.
overt
acts,
4,
7,
14
and
15,
all
deal
with
the
use
of
national
labor
relations
board
facilities.
now,
had
we
charged
as
petitioners
now
contend
in
the
indictment,
nothing
more
than
a
conspiracy
to
file
false
affidavits,
it
would
be
hard
to
see
how
the
testimony
or
the
agreement
that
the
--
signatures
of
various
conspirators
to
national
labor
relations
board
documents
would
be
overt
acts
in
furtherance
of
that
conspiracy.
so
altogether,
we
submit,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
base
of
the
indictment
charged
a
conspiracy-to-defraud.
now
petitions
also
contend
well
that
no
conspiracy-to-defraud
could
have
been
committed
here
because
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
not
have
the
power
to
look
behind
the
truth
of
these
affidavits
and
then
to
place
the
union
in
decompliance
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
leedom
and
mine,
mill
case.
how
we
think
that
looks
at
the
whole
regulatory
scheme
from
the
wrong
point
of
view.
the
question
isn't
whether
a
--
the
labor
board
after
at
false
affidavits
have
been
filed
had
the
power
to
go
back
and
determine
whether
they're
true.
the
question
is
that
as
of
the
time
these
affidavits
are
filed,
as
of
the
time
the
representation
is
made,
would
the
board
be
acting
if
the
truth
were
told
in
those
affidavits?
and
the
answer
is
entirely
clear
that
the
board
under
9
(h)
would
not
have
the
power
to
act
if
the
truth
had
been
told
in
the
affidavits.
if
these
petitioners
had
signed
an
affidavit
which
under
the
proof
here
would
have
been
a
truthful
affidavits
stating
that
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
the
board
could
not
have
gone
ahead
and
offered
them
the
services
and
facility.
consequently,
it's
the
false
statement
at
that
juncture
which
set
the
governmental
operation
into
action
and
did
so
falsely
and
fraudulently.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
(voice

--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
you'd
have
defraud
but
(voice

--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
like
to
use
that.
i
haven't
seen
that
mr.
justice
douglas
and
i'd
--
we'll
be
glad
to
use
it
but
it
doesn't
--
i
--
mr.
justice
black
in
response
to
your
question,
i'm
not
sure
whether
your
statute
--
the
two
statutes
are
interrelated.
in
other
words,
i
--
supposing
that
the
fraud,
the
frauding
of
somebody
of
the
services
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
if
the
man
had
been
tried
and
i
think
(voice
overlap)
well,
right.
if
he
had
been
tried
then
i
don't
think
he
could
be
tried
up
for
the
very
same
facts
second
time
under
that
new
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
but
mr.
justice
black,
9
(h)
doesn't
--
9
(h)
of
itself
has
no
sanctions
(voice
overlap)
in
that
criminal
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
9
(h)
has
no
criminal
sanctions,
it's
not
a
statute
which
prohibits
anybody
from
doing
it.
i
would
think
that
the
--
our
contention
is
that
irrespective
of
whether
9
(h)
itself
was
constitutional,
it
was
at
that
time
a
fraud
against
the
government.
that's
why
our
documents
and
to
do
what
petitioners
in
this
case
did.
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
--
the
final
claim
that
petitioners
make
is
that
the
witnesses
grand
jury
testimony
should
have
been
examined
in
camera
or
produced
for
defense
inspection.
now,
we
submit
that
an
analysis
here
must
begin
with
what
this
court
said
in
the
procter
and
gamble
case
which
is
that
we
start
with
a
wrong
established
policy
that
maintains
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceedings
in
the
federal
courts.
now
grand
jury
minutes
are
in
the
first
instance
intended
to
be
secret
and
we
think
that
rule
succeeds.
the
plaintiff
provides
for
that
and
it
was
not
in
any
way
affected
by
--
in
that
respect
by
the
recent
amendment
for
federal
rules
which
this
court
approved
then
obviously,
grand
jury
minutes
are
not
in
a
class
with
jencks'
statements,
statements
subject
to
18
u.s.c.
3500
or
the
jencks
act.
a
critical
point,
a
critical
distinction
it
seems
to
us
between
the
jencks
statements,
statements
which
the
government
may
have
of
government
witnesses
made
to
agents
to
the
government
and
grand
jury
minutes
is
that
jencks
statements
could
presumably
be
handed
over
by
the
government
to
the
defense
at
the
government's
choice.
there's
no
policy
--
no
traditional
policy
of
secrecy
regarding
that
but
there
is
a
governmental
policy
which
presumably
can
be
waived
by
the
government.
but
the
government
has
no
option
to
hand
over
grand
jury
minutes
whenever
it
chooses.
rule
6
(c)
specifically
provides
that
attorneys
for
the
government
may
disclose
grand
jury
minutes
only
when
so
directed
by
the
court
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with
the
judicial
proceeding.
that
means
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
its
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
what
that
does
--
what
--
the
rule
that
the
court
has
to
direct
the
threads
minimal
of
grand
jury
minutes
means
is
that
it
should
only
be
in
the
rare
instance
that
a
court
directs
that
they'd
be
handed
over
without
any
sort
of
inspection
at
all.
petitioners
here
contend
in
reliance
somewhat
on
pittsburgh
plate
glass
case
that
they
should
have
been
entitled
to
direct
disclosure
to
them
of
grand
juries.
now
this
is
not
the
kind
of
situation
we
submit
in
which
court
should
be
ordering
or
a
prosecution
counsel
can
just
be
handing
over
minutes.
the
court
should
itself
examine
minutes
to
determine
whether
any
judicial
policy
and
secrecy
apart
from
the
government's
interest
with
any
judicial
policy
of
secrecy
maybe
is
in
anyway
being
overridden
or
injured
by
the
disclosure
to
the
defense.
now,
the
reason
we
submit
why
the
judge
was
not
to
be
required
in
every
instance
to
examine
grand
jury
minutes
in
camera
is
simply
--
now
what
this
would
result
then
is
substantial
delay
and
very
heavy
burdens
on
trial
judges.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh
i've
been
told
mr.
justice
stewart
that
what
--
the
way
it's
worked
out
on
the
second
circuit
that
there's
almost
automatic
disclosure
of
grand
jury
minutes.
what
happens
is
that
--
it's
like
a
jencks'
statement.
the
defendant
says
“i
want
the
grand
jury
minutes.”
the
judges
say,
“well,
hand
them
over”
and
we
think
that
that
really
isn't
what
rule
6
(c)
is
intended
to
do.
the
judge
should
be
looking
at
the
minutes
but
we
think
that
that
--
that's
the
necessary
result
of
a
rule
that
says
you've
got
to
look
at
the
minutes
all
the
time
because
judges
feel
substantially
burdened
by
the
task
of
taking
on
the
grand
jury
minutes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
that
--
that
may
be
very
well
be
true
too.
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
unless
the
--
mass
government
counsel
says
that
there's
something
that
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
guess
it's
not
often
but
occasionally.
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
any
noticeable
on
--
no,
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
none
that
i
heard
of
(voice
overlap).
all
that
we
argued
really
is
that
in
order
to
justify
even
an
in
camera
inspection,
the
imposition
that
this
puts
on
the
trial
judge,
the
defendants
should
be
required
to
say
something
and
point
to
some
particular
matter
in
the
witnesses'
testimony
or
some
--
some
specific
item
which
he
things
would
justify
an
in
camera
inspection.
now
on
this
case,
petitioners
have
managed
to
do
so
very
successfully
in
this
court,
but
if
the
trial
transcript
is
examined,
they
didn't
make
nearly
the
same
showing
in
the
trial
court
as
they've
done
here
in
the
various
illustrations
in
their
brief
and
those
showings
could
have
been
made
in
the
trial
court.
generally,
the
statements
made
in
the
trial
court
were
that
--
all
that
the
witnesses'
testimony
knows
with
declarations
that
it
--
the
specific
wording
of
the
declarations
might
be
important
and
a
general
allegation
of
inconsistency
with
prior
testimony.
but
in
this
case
or
in
this
court,
petitioners
have
pointed
to
specific
alleged
inconsistencies
between
public
testimony
of
the
witnesses
which
they
did
not
do
in
the
district
court.
and
we
think
that
the
transcript
reflects
and
quite
clearly
that
the
court
was
willing
if
there
had
been
or
any
real
attempt
made
to
have
them
examine
this
transcript
to
really
look
at
the
transcripts
but
no
real
attempt
was
made.
and
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
no
harm
could
possibly
be
done
to
petitioners
if
the
case
were
now
remanded
after
the
district
judge
look
at
those
minutes
to
certify
whether
there
were
inconsistencies
which
would
have
justified
any
motive
of
the
defense.
general
taylor
has
pointed
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
witnesses,
mr.
mason
died
between
the
first
and
second
trial.
well
all
what
that
means
is
that
the
district
judge
agreed
to
grand
jury
transcript
and
compares
it
with
the
testimony
of
the
first
trial
determines
whether
there
were
any
inconsistencies.
certainly
if
you
find
that
there
were
no
inconsistencies
that
doesn't
vitiate
this
conviction.
if
you
were
to
find
that
were
no
inconsistencies
then
the
petitioners
were
not
entitled
for
the
grand
jury
transcript
at
neither
at
the
first
trial
nor
the
second
trial
and
the
convictions
could
stand.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
have
been
convicted
of
violating
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
18
u.s.c.
371
and
under
this
court's
limited
grant
of
certiorari,
three
separate
grounds
for
reversal
are
presently
being
asserted.
petitioner's
contentions
have
been
presented
in
their
briefs
and
in
ours
and
in
petitioner's
oral
argument
in
the
following
sequence.
first,
they've
argued
that
the
indictment
under
which
they
were
charged
was
defective
in
that
it
accused
them
of
having
defraud,
conspire
to
defraud
of
the
united
states
whereas
the
body
of
the
indictment
alleged
a
conspiracy
which
did
not
require
for
defraud,
in
other
words
a
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense
against
the
united
states.
second,
petitioners
have
argued
that
their
convictions
are
unconstitutional
because
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
imposed
the
underlying
affidavit
requirement
was
an
impermissible
exercise
of
legislative
power.
and
their
third
contention
has
been
that
their
trial
was
improperly
conducted
in
that
procedural
error
was
committed
with
respect
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
government
witnesses.
before
discussing
each
of
these
three
contentions,
i
think
it
is
important
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
difference
between
each
of
them
in
terms
of
the
result
--
of
the
resulting
judgments
if
any
of
them
should
be
sustained.
taking
first
the
grand
jury
contention,
if
there
were
a
reversal
on
that
ground
alone
that
would
mean
at
most
a
new
trial
under
the
present
indictment.
and
as
i
will
try
later
to
explain
our
view
of
course
that
a
remand
would
be
sufficient,
but
at
most
it
would
mean
a
new
trial
under
the
present
indictment.
it
would
leave
undetermined
the
question
whether
the
indictment
is
valid
and
whether
a
prosecution
such
as
this
one
is
constitutionally
permissible.
the
constitutional
challenge
is
the
other
extreme
because
that
would,
if
successful,
bar
any
further
prosecution
of
these
petitioners
for
the
offense
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
the
first
ground
asserted
by
the
petitioner
is
the
alleged
flaw
in
the
indictment
caused
for
it
to
have
a
different
result
and
that
the
evidence
could
then
be
represented
to
a
new
grand
jury
which
despite
the
lapse
of
the
limitations
period
would
be
entitled
to
enter
a
fresh
indictment
and
then
under
charging
an
offense
to
commit
to
united
states
under
18
u.s.c
3288
which
authorizes
re-indictment
in
case
of
a
flaw
in
the
indictment
after
the
lapse
of
limitations
period
and
there
would
then
be
a
new
trial.
now
i
call
these
differences
to
the
court's
attention
because
it
appears
to
us
that
from
the
vantage
point
of
sound
judicial
administration,
the
three
issues
before
the
court
might
well
be
considered
in
the
order
in
which
they
would
most
probably
obviate
any
need
for
unnecessary
duplication
or
repetitive
later
trials
since
the
--
both
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
statutory
questions
would
not
be
mooted
simply
by
remanding
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
in
other
words,
basic
to
the
right
to
try
these
petitioners
is
the
constitutional
challenge
and
if
as
we
believe
there's
no
merit
to
that
constitutional
claim,
it
would
nonetheless
be
vain
to
retry
them
under
the
present
indictment
if
there
was
still
a
cloud
over
the
question
whether
they
could
be
tried
for
conspiracy-to-defraud.
consequently,
if
the
courts
please,
i
should
like
to
discuss
first
the
constitutional
claim
which
really
our
basic
proposition
is,
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
claim
at
all
or
at
least
that
the
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue
would
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
petitioner's
convictions.
then
second,
the
alleged
flaw
in
the
indictment,
and
finally,
the
district
judge's
treatment
of
the
motions
regarding
the
witnesses'
grand
jury
testimony.
now
we
particularly
urge
that
the
questions
be
considered
in
this
order,
because
the
convictions
presently
before
the
court
are
the
result
of
a
second
trial
of
these
petitioners
and
it
is
now
almost
ten
years
since
the
indictment
was
filed.
our
position
of
course
is,
that
none
of
the
three
contentions
warrants
reversal
of
the
judgments
of
conviction.
that
we
also
believe
that
it
would
not
be
in
the
interest
either
of
petitioners
or
of
the
government
to
remand
this
case
or
in
the
interest
of
judicial
administration
and
the
conservation
of
judicial
resources
to
remand
this
case
without
--
if
the
case
will
remand
for
a
new
trial
without
removing
the
clouds
that
are
presented
by
the
constitutional
issue
and
by
the
statutory
claim.
i
turn
therefore
first
to
the
constitutional
issue.
the
taft-hartley
amendments
of
1947
added
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
section
9
(h),
was
in
turn
repealed
the
1959
with
the
landrum-griffin
act
of
that
year.
that
provision
states
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
shall
make
no
investigation
and
issue
no
complaint
on
behalf
of
members
of
the
union
or
on
behalf
of
the
union
itself,
unless
that
union
or
its
members
or
its
officers
have
filed
with
the
board
affidavits
of
each
of
the
officers
stating
that
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
affiliated
with
the
party.
petitioners
were
convicted
on
a
one-count
indictment
which
charged
them
with
having
conspired
in
violation
of
the
general
conspiracy
statute
to
defraud
the
national
labor
relations
board
by
filing
--
first,
by
filing
false
affidavits,
second,
obtaining
a
certificate
of
compliance
and
then
third,
using
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
with
knowledge
of
the
underlying
fraud.
their
claim
is
that
because
section
9
(h)
is
allegedly
unconstitutional,
that
constitutional
infirmity
vitiates
their
convictions.
our
principal
position
is
that
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h)
does
not
affect
the
validity
of
petitioner's
convictions
at
all.
it
is
important
in
this
regard
to
consider
what
section
9
(h)
commands
to
the
extent
that
it
has
a
command
and
what
the
petitioners
are
convicted
of
having
done.
section
9
(h)
conditioned
the
availability
of
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
the
filing
of
non-communist
affidavits
by
union
officers.
it
said
to
officers
in
effect,
if
you
want
your
union
to
enjoy
the
facilities
of
the
labor
board,
you
must
be
prepared
to
file
non-communist
affidavits.
to
the
extent
that
section
9
(h)
could
be
violated
at
all,
it
can
be
said
something
violated,
it
had
a
self-executing
sense.
in
other
words,
if
officers
violated
it,
if
they've
failed
to
file
affidavits,
their
union
was
barred
from
enjoying
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
but
the
petitioners
were
not
charged
in
having
violated
section
9
(h)
which
could
be
done
by
not
filing
affidavits
with
the
board.
what
they
were
charged
with
was
a
separate
and
distinct
offense
which
was
conspiring
to
defraud
by
filing
false
statements
with
the
government
upon
which
governmental
action
was
taken.
their
constitutional
claim,
if
it
were
sound,
meant
really
nothing
more
that
they
were
entitled
to
challenge
section
9
(h)
by
ignoring
the
statute,
by
not
filing
any
affidavits,
but
it
did
not
mean
that
they
could
lawfully
commit
an
entirely
separate
and
distinct
offense.
assume
for
example,
hypothetically,
that
petitioners
on
this
record
had
decided
instead
of
that
--
instead
of
filing
false
affidavits,
they
would
prevent
the
impact
of
section
9
(h)
upon
their
union
by
bribing
the
official
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
who
was
in
charged
of
the
records
of
the
board
with
regard
to
such
affidavits,
and
bribing
him
to
have
him
alter
the
records
in
order
to
reflect
that
they
had
filed
the
affidavits.
it
seems
entirely
clear
to
us
that
it
would
not
be
a
defense
to
bribery
prosecution
in
such
circumstances
for
them
to
say
“oh
we
didn't
have
to
file
any
affidavits
at
all.”
their
lawful
response
to
the
--
to
the
requirement
that
they
file
affidavits
if
they
had
a
constitutional
challenge
to
that
requirement,
was
not
to
file
the
affidavits
and
to
do
what
the
plaintiffs
did
in
american
communication
association
versus
doud,
which
is
the
case
in
which
this
court
did
pass
in
a
proper
procedural
context
on
the
constitution
--
very
same
constitutional
challenge
make
here
by
petitioners.
in
other
words
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
union
and
the
officers
used
to
file
affidavit
--
and
then
when
the
national
labor
relations
board
failed
to
place
the
union's
name
in
a
representation
election,
they've
brought
suit
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
against
the
board
to
require
the
board
to
make
the
appropriate
measures,
taking
appropriate
steps.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
mr.
justice
black,
yes.
that
the
proper
response
in
a
--
in
our
legal
system
is
to
challenge
the
obligation,
not
by
committing
another
offense,
a
distinct
offense
which
is
filing
a
false
statement
or
committing
fraud
but
by
not
answering
at
all.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
well,
we
think
yes.
we
think
that
--
just
as
they
could
be
tried,
just
as
people
in
this
position
could
be
tried
for
any
other
crime.
i
think
really
an
answer
with
(voice
overlap)
response
to
your
particular
crime
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
their
response
to
the
unlawful
inquiry
would
be
not
to
answer
and
then,
if
it
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
think
mr.
justice
black,
it
might
will
be
a
defense
if
you
say
if
they
--
will
require
to
answer
through
fear
or
through
some
form
of
coercion
but
if
they
have
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
their
obligation
is
just
not
to
answer,
not
--
and
they
may
not
answer
falsely
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
mr.
justice
black
because
we
think
that
they've
committed
a
separate
offense,
we
think
that
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
is
our
argument.
general
taylor
has
said
that
our
contention
is
in
line
with
your
question
mr.
justice
black
that
if
it
--
if
a
government
inquiry
is
authorized
by
statute,
although
it
may
be
claimed
to
be
unconstitutional,
then
if
a
person
who's
asked
that
question,
he
can
be
put
to
the
choice
of
either
answering
it
or
challenging
it
by
not
answering
it,
but
may
not
answer
falsely.
now
we
think
that's
--
that's
precisely
right,
he
may
not
answer
falsely.
he
may
not
--
he
may
not
shoot
the
interrogator.
he
may
not
bribe
the
interrogator
and
we
think
he
may
also
not
answer
falsely.
each
one
of
those
is
a
separate
offense
which
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
under
this
statute
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
no
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
that
they
didn't
answer
but
then
he
would
have
the
constitutional
claim
then
he
could
assert
his
constitutional
claim
and
we
think
under
our
system,
that's
what
a
--
that's
what
somebody
who
was
subject
to
an
unconstitutional
request
must
do.
he
must
challenge
it
by
not
answering
or
by
taking
whatever
steps,
whatever
lawful
steps,
the
minimum
steps
in
terms
if
not
committing
other
offenses
that
are
available
to
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
would
have
been
possible
--
it
would
not
have
been
--
it
wouldn't
have
been
void,
i
don't
think
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
think
it
would
have
been
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir
because
it
was
a
false
statement
and
because
the
petitioners
could
have
raised
their
constitutional
claim
by
simply
not
filing
any
statement
and
it
did
give
them,
the
fact
that
the
statute
might
be
unconstitutional
did
not
give
them
a
light
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
a
--
under
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
under
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
statute
which
is
what
this
prosecution
was
brought
under,
i
think
the
statement
would
have
to
be
material
because
fraud
would
have
been
--
would
be
required.
and
that
means
that
the
false
statement
would
have
to
be
material
to
something
which
the
filers
are
attempting
to
obtain.
under
1001
on
the
--
well,
i'm
sorry
i
think
i
would
have
to
insert
on
1001.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
this
is
the
conspiracy
to
violate
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
we
think
the
--
our
argument
in
this
regard
is
really
--
makes
this
case
very
similar
for
example
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
williams,
which
involved
a
--
the
question,
the
validity
of
a
perjury
charge,
made
against
a
witness
who
had
testified
allegedly
falsely
in
a
criminal
trial
on
an
indictment
which
did
not
as
this
court
held
state
of
federal
offense.
now
presumably
the
court
in
that
case,
in
the
williams
case,
did
not
have
in
one
sense
jurisdiction.
they
couldn't
proceed
to
try
that
case
and
yet,
witnesses
who
appeared
before
it,
if
they
were
to
make
that
kind
of
a
challenge,
certainly
couldn't
even
contest
the
court's
jurisdiction
before
they
were
able
to
testify.
and
yet
this
court
held
in
williams
that
that
did
not
give
them
the
option
of
committing
the
entirely
distinct
and
separate
crime
of
perjury.
the
kapp
and
kay
cases
are
not
as
general
taylor
suggested,
separate
branches
of
our
argument,
they
were
all
--
we
believe
they
were
all
welded
in,
they're
part
of
the
very
same
proposition.
in
kapp,
the
defendants
had
been
charged
with
conspiring
to
defraud
the
united
states
by
submitting
false
claims
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act.
presumably,
those
claims
were
nullity.
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
time
the
case
--
that
the
validity
of
that
indictment
was
determined
by
the
district
court.
and
yet
this
court
held
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
was
unconstitutional,
that
did
not
give
the
defendants
in
that
case
a
license
to
commit
a
separate
and
distinct
crime.
essentially,
at
the
heart
of
our
argument
is
the
very
same
proposition
we
think
--
or
the
very
same
broad
principle
which
is
--
which
underlies
this
court's
decision
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
which
is
that
there
are
certain
lawful
responses
which
may
be
made
to
demands
or
requests
of
courts
or
governmental
agencies
which
may
be
impermissible,
whether
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
whether
because
of
a
constitutional
challenge,
and
the
permissible
responses
are
not
to
be
the
--
either
not
to
respond
to
the
demand
or
to
take
whatever
minimum
steps
are
necessary
in
order
to
present
the
constitutional
claim
in
appropriate
litigation.
but
a
constitutional
challenge
does
not,
under
our
system,
give
the
person
who
is
subject
to
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
demand,
the
option
of
committing
a
whole
range
of
--
a
broad
range
of
crimes,
simply
in
order
to
avoid
the
impact
of
what
he
claims
is
an
unconstitutional
request
or
demand
and
that
we
think
is
what
is
in
issue
here.
if
the
government
--
if
the
labor
board
under
section
9
(h)
did
not
have
the
power
to
demand
these
affidavits,
petitioners'
option
was
not
to
submit
affidavits.
they
could
not
bribe
the
labor
board
employee
nor
could
they
submit
false
affidavits.
a
court
which
has
no
jurisdiction
may
not
under
the
united
mine
workers
case,
cavalierly
disobey.
an
agency
which
has
cons
--
no
constitutional
power,
may
not
under
this
court's
decision
in
kapp
be
cheated.
a
court
which
is
trying
to
charge
which
did
not
amount
to
a
federal
crime
may
not
under
williams
be
lied
to
and
there
are
many
cases
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
or
considerable
number
of
case
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
which
involved
grand
jury's
calling
witnesses
without
informing
them
of
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
then
putting
questions
to
them.
in
one
sense,
the
questions
certainly
in
those
cases
are
unauthorized.
the
witness,
who
is
ignorant
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
presumably
doesn't
have
the
option
of
refusing
to
answer.
he
doesn't
know
what
it
is
he
can
do
and
what
his
lawful
rights
are.
and
yet,
courts
have
held
that
a
false
answer
under
those
circumstances
amounts
to
perjury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
of
any
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
it
might
be
different
in
first
amendment
case
if
possibly
mr.
justice
black.
in
other
words,
possibly
the
mere
obligation
of
answering
of
any
kind
if
a
witness
is
ignorant,
certainly
if
he's
ignorant
of
his
various
options,
he
ought
not
in
any
way
to
be
penalized
for
what
it
is
that
he's
answering.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
even
if
it
involved
first
amendment
rights,
the
petitioners
had
the
advice
of
counsel,
they
knew
what
it
is
that
their
choices
were
and
indeed,
i
don't
think
that
there's
probably
no
doubt
that
they
consciously
chose
to
file
affidavits
rather
than
not
file
them
and
make
a
constitutional
challenge
in
an
appropriate
proceeding
because
they
knew
that
it
--
they
may
be
appropriate
challenge,
it
would
then
--
have
been
rejected
under
the
douds
case.
so
that
they
--
they
made
in
this
case
a
very
knowing
choice
when
they
determined
that
they
would
file
false
affidavits
rather
than
not
filing
the
affidavits
at
all.
i
think
it's
possible
that
in
certain
first
amendment
context
if
a
--
if
they
--
a
person
who
has
asked
the
question
does
not
have
the
advice
of
counsel
and
does
not
know
what
his
options
are
it
might
very
well
be
unfair
or
possibly
constitutionally
impermissible
then
to
prosecute
him
because
the
answer
turns
out
to
be
false,
but
i
don't
think
that's
this
case.
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim,
i
would
like
to
make
these
two
points,
after
noting.
first
of
course,
that
the
ground
that
the
majority
of
the
court
or
in
douds
determine
that
section
9
(h)
was
constitutional
or
was
not
a
bill
of
attainder,
was
of
course
pro
tanto
overruled
in
archie
brown.
in
douds,
the
court
adverted
to
the
fact
that
9
(h)
was
not
a
bill
of
attainder
because
it
operated
only
prospectively
and
to
that
extent,
this
court
has
overruled
that
portion
under
douds
holding
in
the
archie
brown
case.
however,
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
the
bill
of
attainder
cases
and
particularly
in
the
lovett
case,
there
was
heavy
emphasis
placed
by
the
court
on
the
question
of
whether
what
congress
was
doing
amounted
to
punishment
and
it
was
held
in
lovett
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
sanction
was
not
a
criminal
one
it
nonetheless
did
amount
to
punishment.
in
this
case,
in
9
(h)
we
believe
that
the
court
in
douds
held
that
it
was
the
effect
of
the
affidavit
requirement
was
a
discouragement
and
that's
the
court's
language
and
we
submit
that
to
that
extent,
9
(h)
is
distinguishable
from
the
successor
statute
in
section
504
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
because
it
is
merely
a
discouragement
and
this
court
in
a
footnote
in
the
aptheker
case,
made
that
very
distinction
between
douds
and
the
statute
that
was
before
them
in
aptheker.
and
we
think
that
that
would
be
a
ground
for
distinguishing
9
(h)
from
the
archie
brown
statute
in
bill
of
attainder
terms.
with
regard
to
general
taylor's
reference
to
this
court's
recent
decision
in
elfbrandt,
of
course
this
indictment
did
not
allege
specific
intent
because
what
petitioners
were
being
charged
with
was
not
mere
membership
in
a
communist
party
or
anything
that
would
have
required
a
showing
of
specific
intent.
they
were
charged
with
having
lied
in
the
statements
of
the
government.
they
said
to
the
government
that
they
had
--
they
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
only
material
question
is
whether
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party
and
whether
that
statement
if
they
were
not
was
a
lie.
consequently
specific
intent
in
the
indictment
or
in
the
proof
was
a
--
would
have
been
any
relevance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
right.
we
think
it
must
be
knowing
because
otherwise
the
statement
isn't
false,
presumably
somebody
who
doesn't
know
that
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
he
said
that
he's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
real
reason
they
weren't
charged
mr.
chief
justice
is,
that
there
were
some
doubt
--
apparently
the
time
that
the
indictment
was
drafted
whether
an
indictment
charging
them
both
with
conspiracy-to-defraud
and
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
might
not
be
duplicitous.
now
of
course,
there
have
been
many
cases
in
this
court
and
other
courts
that
have
held
that
it
would
not
be
duplicitous,
but
i
think
(voice
overlap)
access
or
cautions
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
next
with
regard
to
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
if
i
may
on
the
right
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
i'm
just
trying
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
with
regard
to
the
petitioner's
second
contention
which
is
precisely
that
they
should
have
been
charged
with
18
u.s.c.
1001
rather
than
with
a
conspiracy-to-defraud.
we
think
the
short
answer
is
that
the
indictment
on
its
face
charges
more
than
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001.
it
charges
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001,
plus,
further
acts
committed
in
pursuance
of
a
fraud
on
the
united
states.
and
for
that
reason
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
that
if
the
petitioner's
crime
were
properly
defined,
it
would
really
be
--
they
conspired
to
violate
1001
and
they
conspire
it
to
defraud.
it
was
one
conspiracy
but
its
objectives
were
--
went
beyond
nearly
filing
false
affidavits.
mr.
nathan
lewin
only
in
the
sense
that
9
(h)
has
the
sanction
of
not
providing
board
itself
(voice
overlap)
it's
not
if
you
don't
violate.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
white,
because
all
that
--
all
that
9
(h)
does
is
it
tells
the
board,
you
may
not
offer
your
facilities
to
such
and
such
unions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
unless
something
happened.
so
i
don't
think
anybody
--
any
individual
can
really
violate
9
(h)
in
that
sense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
--
i
think
under
the
perjury
statute,
this
would
have
to
be
before
tribunal
competent
jurisdiction.
i'm
not
sure
whether
affidavits
filed
on
those
circumstances
could
be
perjurious.
and
i
think
--
in
addition
mr.
justice
douglas
that
9
(h)
provide
that
the
false
statements,
18
u.s.c.
1001
will
apply
to
these
statements.
so
even
a
perjury
were
available,
i
think
that
really
would
be
no
occasion
ever
to
use
a
perjury
charge.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
indictment
mr.
justice
fortas,
did
not
refer
to
that
one.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
precisely
our
position.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right,
we're
saying
no
matter
how
that's
decided,
it
does
not
affect
these
convictions
just
as
it
would
not
affect
the
bribery
conviction
or
result
conviction
on
--
if
it
were
--
if
it
that
would
be
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
we
think
that
the
phase
of
the
indictment
as
a
matter
of
fact,
shows
that
what
was
involved
here
was
much
more
than
a
conspiracy
merely
to
violate
1001
or
to
file
false
affidavit.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
don't
mention
1001
but
well
--
it
was
-
in
the
course,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
course
of
committing
their
greater
conspiracy
that
conspirators
we
think
violated
--
could
very
well
been
charged
with
having
violated
1001.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
were
not
charged
with
that,
but
the
indictment,
if
i
can
just
point
to
pages
2
and
3
of
the
indictment,
it's
entirely
clear
from
the
face
of
the
indictment
that
there
were
three
parts
to
the
conspiracy.
only
the
first
part
of
the
conspiracy
as
alleged
was
the
filing
of
false
affidavits.
the
second
part,
and
that's
alleged
in
an
entirely
separate
paragraph
which
appears
on
page
3,
was
that
the
cons
--
the
conspirators,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
others,
induced
the
labor
board
to
issue
certificates
of
compliance
based
on
these
false
affidavits.
and
the
third
paragraph
is
that
the
conspirators
then
may
over
a
period
of
use
of
the
board's
facilities
knowing
that
the
underlying
affidavits
had
been
false
and
fraudulent.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
can
think
of
the
--
i
can
think
of
none
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
could
have
taken
either
one
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
i
think
it's
possible
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
think
it
more
accurately
describes
what
the
conspirators
did
really.
they
didn't.
they
--
had
they
--
had
they've
been
violating
1001,
then
presumably
and
arguably
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right,
but
i
think
that
can
only
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
same
penalty,
i
think
arguably
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
they
might
have
contend
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
they
might
then
have
contended
and
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
sound
but
they
might
have
contended
that
their
conspiracies
were
separate
conspiracies
then
for
each
year.
they
might
have
argued
well
you
can't
charge
this
with
one
overall
conspiracy
when
each
year
we've
been
conspiring
to
file
false
statement.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
we
don't
think
we
have
to
cut
into
any
--
any
statement
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh
no,
because
the
bridges
case
which
is
i
think
the
only
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
the
bridges
case
was
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
a
case
in
which
the
question
was
with
the
war-time
suspension
of
limitations
act
which
extended
a
period
of
limitations
for
fraud
against
the
united
states
would
apply
to
a
case
in
which
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
was
charged
in
which
the
whole
conspiracy-to-defraud
consisted
only
of
the
commission
of
substantive
offenses,
various
substantive
offenses
which
is
making
a
false
statement
to
a
naturalization
officer,
obtaining
a
false
naturalization
certificate.
and
that
was
all
that
could
--
all
that
the
conspiracy
there
charged
involved.
it's
distinguishable
from
this
case
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
the
court
was
entirely
clear
on
bridges
that
it
was
construing
the
war-time
suspension
of
limitations
act
which
the
court
there
said
was
--
should
be
given
very
conservative
construction,
what
amounts
to
a
fraud
on
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
the
war-time
suspension
of
limitations
act,
is
not
the
very
same
thing
as
would
be
a
fraud
for
purposes
of
the
conspiracy
to
defraud
statute.
really,
i
think
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
bridges
was
the
fact
that
almost
any
conspiracy-to-defraud
encompasses
lots
of
subs
--
commission
of
substantive
offenses.
an
author
of
the
law
review
article
in
--
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
has
maintained
that
that
--
all
of
the
cases
involving
conspiracy-to-defraud
which
have
been
brought
could
be
brought
as
conspiracy
to
commit
substantive
offenses
case.
and
yet
in
this
case,
we
believe
there
was
more
to
the
conspiracy
than
merely
the
commission
of
the
substantive
offense
of
violating
1001,
and
that
we
think
is
the
second
distinction
from
bridges.
in
bridges,
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
encompassed
and
nothing
more
just
the
commission
of
various
substantive
offenses.
in
this
case,
the
second
and
third
parts
of
conspiracy
alleged
in
the
indictment
didn't
involve
any
substantive
offense
at
all.
there
is
no
substantive
offense
that
says
that
you're
committing
an
offense
against
the
united
states
if
you
induce
the
labor
board
to
issue
to
you
a
certificate
of
compliance
based
on
somebody
else's
or
on
your
own,
false
non-communist
affidavit.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
say
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment
amount
to
a
violation
of
1001
and
more,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
our
first
answer
of
course
is
that
if
we
could
properly
charge
it
then,
even
if
they
weren't
prejudiced
that
there
was
--
its
lawful
prejudice.
i
mean,
we
think
that
this
is
really
what
--
this
really
amounted
to
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
not
merely
to
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
and
our
second
response
is,
that
the
prejudice
exists
in
any
case
in
which
a
defendant
is
charged
with
a
greater
offense
and
convicted
of
a
lesser.
now
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
then
we
think
that
the
error
was
not
prejudicial
and
that
that
--
because,
the
petitioners
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
knew
exactly
from
the
fact
spelled
out
very
carefully
indict
--
in
the
indictment,
what
they
were
being
charged
with.
and
at
most,
what
they
were
charged
with
was
violating
1001
and
going
on
and
doing
other
things.
if
they
were
convicted
only
of
violating
1001,
then
they
are
prejudiced
is
no
greater
than
being
convicted
of
a
lesser
included
offense
in
--
when
they're
charged
with
a
greater.
the
judge
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
haven't
seen
the
statute
of
limitations
question
in
petitioner's
brief
really
and
i
really
don't
know
exactly
what
it
would
be.
it
appears
--
it
appears
to
us
really
then
mr.
justice
harlan
that
a
conspiracy
going
lasting
into
a
limitations
period
of
this
sort,
whether
it's
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
or
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
would
involve
the
same
proof,
and
that
we
just
don't
see
that
there's
any
difference
in
terms
of
limitations
between
each
other.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
fraud
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
fraud
was
inducing
the
labor
board
to
issue
on
the
basis
of
false
affidavits,
a
certificate
of
compliance
and
then
using
services
of
the
labor
board
which
under
the
statute,
if
--
let's
assume
constitutional,
the
petitioner
union
was
not
entitled
to.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
(voice
overlap)
not
necessary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
necessarily
mr.
--
it's
possible
it
seems
to
us
to
file
false
statements
under
1001
and
then
go
no
farther.
then
never
--
assuming
--
if
one
union
officer
for
example
may
file
false
statement
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
because
here,
petitioners
did
more.
they
didn't
merely
file
a
false
affidavit.
they
then
went
on
and
tried
to
use
the
false
affidavits
as
a
basis
for
obtaining
--
as
the
a
basis
for
obtaining
benefits
which
they
actively
sought.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
we
could
still
sustain
a
conviction
for
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
right.
well,
i'm
assuming
from
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
we
didn't
prove
that
they
had
any
such
intent
that
they
ever
sought
that
they
just
intended
to
filed
false
affidavits
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
we
think
a
different
--
a
harder
question
would
have
been
presented
which
is
whether
it
would
end
up
in
prejudicial
error
to
allow
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
under
the
indictment
charge
of
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
when
the
proof
amounted
only
to
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001,
which
would
have
been
a
different
and
harder
question.
we
think
the
proof
here
when
it
went
to
the
jury
was
enough
to
sustain
conspiracy-to-defraud.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
then
using
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
now,
then
using
the
labor
board
mr.
justice
black.
its
like
--
if
i
were
to
conspire
with
somebody
else
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
that
--
that's
not
a
separate
offense,
but
that's
exactly
what
the
conspiracy-to-defraud.
mr.
nathan
lewin
except
that
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black,
we
only
--
there's
a
one
count
indictment
and
there's
only
a
single
conspiracy.
we
weren't
seeking
the
accumulate
sentences
like
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
mr.
justice
black,
because
at
that
--
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought
the
statute
9
(h)
was
constitutional
and
it
had
been
held
so
and
--
by
this
court
in
douds
and
i
don't
think
there
was
--
there
--
at
that
time
merely
been
any
thought
that
that
douds
would
be
overruled.
and
the
--
that
the
only
reason
that
this
case
was
brought
under
the
conspiracy
--
under
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
provision,
we
submit
was
that
really
what
the
petitioners
did
in
this
case
was
much
closer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
been
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
i
think.
i
mean
if
--
more
or
so
than
nearly
violations
of
1001,
yes
sir.
although,
even
as
to
that
there
are
cases
--
i
think
we
should
tell
that
if
you
--
if
you
prove
the
conspiracy
you
can
put
in
the
same
evidence
even
if
you
haven't
alleged
--
and
so
--
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
situation
here
is
similar
to
that
which
would
result
for
example
i
and
another
were
to
attempt
to
the
district
of
columbia
of
fraudulent
birth
certificate
for
myself,
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
government
employment
or
a
driver's
license.
now,
when
i
obtained
the
fraudulent
birth
certificate,
i've
committed
one
offense,
but
if
that's
part
of
a
much
larger
scheme
which
is
to
obtain
a
false
certificate
which
will
then
be
used
and
i
then
intend
to
use
it
actively
then
i
committed
a
much
more
--
much
broader
and
more
encompassing
conspiracy
than
merely
obtaining
the
false
certificate.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
black,
because
this
is
one
conspiracy
and
one
count
and
there
was
no
attempt
made
in
this
case
really
either
to
pile
up
sentences
or
to
accumulate
punishments
or
in
any
way
to
fragmentize
what
would
be
a
single
--
a
more
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
couldn't
convict
him
without
proving
that
is
--
that
a
statement
was
false
and
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
and
it
was
required.
mr.
nathan
lewin
haven't
--
we've
gone
--
but
we
did
--
if
we
did
anything
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
without
9
(h).
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
our
position
is
that
we
--
that
even
if
9
(h)
were
unconstitutional
we
could
convict,
yes.
yes
sir.
that
--
that's
what
i'm
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
if
9
(h)
were
not
on
the
books,
of
course
then
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
until
such
time
as
the
labor
board
does
not
have
the
authority
to
demand
these
affidavits,
we
think
those
who
are
subject
to
it
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
sir.
not
as
of
that
time.
the
question
is
of
course,
what
happens
prior
to
the
time
if
the
act
is
declared
unconstitutional
and
it
does
so
under
color
if
you
like
of
constitutional
authority.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
they've
--
well,
there
was
testimony
--
well
from
i
think
a
total
of
ten
witnesses,
each
identifying
what
these
petitioners
and
witnesses
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
because
i
think
they
would
all
have
gone
to
the
question
of
whether
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
only
additional
--
really
the
additional
evidence
that
we
got
in
and
if
--
it
cast
an
added
burden
on
this
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
we
were
required
to
prove
fraud.
and
the
only
additional
evidence
that
came
in
as
a
result
to
that
was
the
use
of
that
--
the
use
of
the
labor
board.
mr.
nathan
lewin
candidly,
if
i've
been
told
that
the
reason
was
--
that
there
was
doubt
as
to
whether
both
1001
and
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
could
be
charged
in
the
same
indictment.
and
it
was
because
of
the
fear
of
--
that
this
would
be
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
could
have
taken
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know.
i
can
only
say
it
seems
in
retrospect
it
could
have
been
an
unwise
choice
but
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
unnecessary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
was
not
there.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
distinguish
bridges
mr.
chief
justice
on
two
grounds.
one
--
the
first
ground
is
that
the
bridges
case
was
concerned
as
the
court
made
entirely
clear
that
with
the
construction
of
the
war-time
suspension
of
limitations
act.
it
said
this
was
a
statute
which
had
been
opposed
for
a
very
limited
number
of
cases.
in
other
words
--
and
said
it
was
--
it
should
be
given
conservative
interpretation.
and
the
question
was,
whether
acts
such
as
those
alleged
in
the
indictment
in
bridges,
amounting
to
a
fraud
within
the
meaning
of
that
suspension
of
limitations
act
and
the
court
held
that
they
did
not
amount
to
a
fraud
within
the
meaning
of
that
act.
now
have
the
court
held
as
petitioners
now
contend
that
that
could
not
even
have
amounted
to
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
at
all,
presumably
the
court
could
have
--
or
petitioners
in
that
case
would
have
been
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
altogether
as
they
did
here.
the
court
didn't
dismiss
the
indictment
in
bridges.
it
didn't
say
it
was
--
it
improperly
charges
an
offense.
it
said
only
that
it
did
not
come
with
the
union
suspension
of
limitations
which
that
very
limited
statute
provided.
and
our
second
ground
for
distinguishing
bridges
is
that
on
fact,
bridges
really
did
not
involve
anything
more
than
a
conspiracy
to
commit
three
substantive
offenses
and
there
was
nothing
more
alleged
in
the
conspiracy
count
then
that
the
conspirators
had,
as
part
of
their
conspiracy
committed
each
of
those
three
substantive
offenses.
in
this
case,
the
second
and
third
portions
of
the
conspiracy
are
not
substantive
offenses
at
all.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
it's
properly
charged
them
as
fraud
on
the
united
states
and
not
merely
a
substantive
offense.
in
addition,
we
think
that
it's
entirely
clear
not
only
from
the
first
portion
of
the
indictment
but
from
the
overt
acts
which
are
alleged.
that
much
more
was
charged
in
the
indictment
than
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001.
overt
acts,
4,
7,
14
and
15,
all
deal
with
the
use
of
national
labor
relations
board
facilities.
now,
had
we
charged
as
petitioners
now
contend
in
the
indictment,
nothing
more
than
a
conspiracy
to
file
false
affidavits,
it
would
be
hard
to
see
how
the
testimony
or
the
agreement
that
the
--
signatures
of
various
conspirators
to
national
labor
relations
board
documents
would
be
overt
acts
in
furtherance
of
that
conspiracy.
so
altogether,
we
submit,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
base
of
the
indictment
charged
a
conspiracy-to-defraud.
now
petitions
also
contend
well
that
no
conspiracy-to-defraud
could
have
been
committed
here
because
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
not
have
the
power
to
look
behind
the
truth
of
these
affidavits
and
then
to
place
the
union
in
decompliance
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
leedom
and
mine,
mill
case.
how
we
think
that
looks
at
the
whole
regulatory
scheme
from
the
wrong
point
of
view.
the
question
isn't
whether
a
--
the
labor
board
after
at
false
affidavits
have
been
filed
had
the
power
to
go
back
and
determine
whether
they're
true.
the
question
is
that
as
of
the
time
these
affidavits
are
filed,
as
of
the
time
the
representation
is
made,
would
the
board
be
acting
if
the
truth
were
told
in
those
affidavits?
and
the
answer
is
entirely
clear
that
the
board
under
9
(h)
would
not
have
the
power
to
act
if
the
truth
had
been
told
in
the
affidavits.
if
these
petitioners
had
signed
an
affidavit
which
under
the
proof
here
would
have
been
a
truthful
affidavits
stating
that
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
the
board
could
not
have
gone
ahead
and
offered
them
the
services
and
facility.
consequently,
it's
the
false
statement
at
that
juncture
which
set
the
governmental
operation
into
action
and
did
so
falsely
and
fraudulently.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
you'd
have
defraud
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
like
to
use
that.
i
haven't
seen
that
mr.
justice
douglas
and
i'd
--
we'll
be
glad
to
use
it
but
it
doesn't
--
i
--
mr.
justice
black
in
response
to
your
question,
i'm
not
sure
whether
your
statute
--
the
two
statutes
are
interrelated.
in
other
words,
i
--
supposing
that
the
fraud,
the
frauding
of
somebody
of
the
services
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
if
the
man
had
been
tried
and
i
think
(voice
overlap)
well,
right.
if
he
had
been
tried
then
i
don't
think
he
could
be
tried
up
for
the
very
same
facts
second
time
under
that
new
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
but
mr.
justice
black,
9
(h)
doesn't
--
9
(h)
of
itself
has
no
sanctions
(voice
overlap)
in
that
criminal
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
9
(h)
has
no
criminal
sanctions,
it's
not
a
statute
which
prohibits
anybody
from
doing
it.
i
would
think
that
the
--
our
contention
is
that
irrespective
of
whether
9
(h)
itself
was
constitutional,
it
was
at
that
time
a
fraud
against
the
government.
that's
why
our
documents
and
to
do
what
petitioners
in
this
case
did.
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
--
the
final
claim
that
petitioners
make
is
that
the
witnesses
grand
jury
testimony
should
have
been
examined
in
camera
or
produced
for
defense
inspection.
now,
we
submit
that
an
analysis
here
must
begin
with
what
this
court
said
in
the
procter
and
gamble
case
which
is
that
we
start
with
a
wrong
established
policy
that
maintains
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceedings
in
the
federal
courts.
now
grand
jury
minutes
are
in
the
first
instance
intended
to
be
secret
and
we
think
that
rule
succeeds.
the
plaintiff
provides
for
that
and
it
was
not
in
any
way
affected
by
--
in
that
respect
by
the
recent
amendment
for
federal
rules
which
this
court
approved
then
obviously,
grand
jury
minutes
are
not
in
a
class
with
jencks'
statements,
statements
subject
to
18
u.s.c.
3500
or
the
jencks
act.
a
critical
point,
a
critical
distinction
it
seems
to
us
between
the
jencks
statements,
statements
which
the
government
may
have
of
government
witnesses
made
to
agents
to
the
government
and
grand
jury
minutes
is
that
jencks
statements
could
presumably
be
handed
over
by
the
government
to
the
defense
at
the
government's
choice.
there's
no
policy
--
no
traditional
policy
of
secrecy
regarding
that
but
there
is
a
governmental
policy
which
presumably
can
be
waived
by
the
government.
but
the
government
has
no
option
to
hand
over
grand
jury
minutes
whenever
it
chooses.
rule
6
(c)
specifically
provides
that
attorneys
for
the
government
may
disclose
grand
jury
minutes
only
when
so
directed
by
the
court
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with
the
judicial
proceeding.
that
means
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
its
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
what
that
does
--
what
--
the
rule
that
the
court
has
to
direct
the
threads
minimal
of
grand
jury
minutes
means
is
that
it
should
only
be
in
the
rare
instance
that
a
court
directs
that
they'd
be
handed
over
without
any
sort
of
inspection
at
all.
petitioners
here
contend
in
reliance
somewhat
on
pittsburgh
plate
glass
case
that
they
should
have
been
entitled
to
direct
disclosure
to
them
of
grand
juries.
now
this
is
not
the
kind
of
situation
we
submit
in
which
court
should
be
ordering
or
a
prosecution
counsel
can
just
be
handing
over
minutes.
the
court
should
itself
examine
minutes
to
determine
whether
any
judicial
policy
and
secrecy
apart
from
the
government's
interest
with
any
judicial
policy
of
secrecy
maybe
is
in
anyway
being
overridden
or
injured
by
the
disclosure
to
the
defense.
now,
the
reason
we
submit
why
the
judge
was
not
to
be
required
in
every
instance
to
examine
grand
jury
minutes
in
camera
is
simply
--
now
what
this
would
result
then
is
substantial
delay
and
very
heavy
burdens
on
trial
judges.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh
i've
been
told
mr.
justice
stewart
that
what
--
the
way
it's
worked
out
on
the
second
circuit
that
there's
almost
automatic
disclosure
of
grand
jury
minutes.
what
happens
is
that
--
it's
like
a
jencks'
statement.
the
defendant
says
“i
want
the
grand
jury
minutes.”
the
judges
say,
“well,
hand
them
over”
and
we
think
that
that
really
isn't
what
rule
6
(c)
is
intended
to
do.
the
judge
should
be
looking
at
the
minutes
but
we
think
that
that
--
that's
the
necessary
result
of
a
rule
that
says
you've
got
to
look
at
the
minutes
all
the
time
because
judges
feel
substantially
burdened
by
the
task
of
taking
on
the
grand
jury
minutes
(voice

--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
that
--
that
may
be
very
well
be
true
too.
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
this
case
(voice

--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
unless
the
--
mass
government
counsel
says
that
there's
something
that
the
government
(voice

--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
guess
it's
not
often
but
occasionally.
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
any
noticeable
on
--
no,
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
none
that
i
heard
of
(voice

all
that
we
argued
really
is
that
in
order
to
justify
even
an
in
camera
inspection,
the
imposition
that
this
puts
on
the
trial
judge,
the
defendants
should
be
required
to
say
something
and
point
to
some
particular
matter
in
the
witnesses'
testimony
or
some
--
some
specific
item
which
he
things
would
justify
an
in
camera
inspection.
now
on
this
case,
petitioners
have
managed
to
do
so
very
successfully
in
this
court,
but
if
the
trial
transcript
is
examined,
they
didn't
make
nearly
the
same
showing
in
the
trial
court
as
they've
done
here
in
the
various
illustrations
in
their
brief
and
those
showings
could
have
been
made
in
the
trial
court.
generally,
the
statements
made
in
the
trial
court
were
that
--
all
that
the
witnesses'
testimony
knows
with
declarations
that
it
--
the
specific
wording
of
the
declarations
might
be
important
and
a
general
allegation
of
inconsistency
with
prior
testimony.
but
in
this
case
or
in
this
court,
petitioners
have
pointed
to
specific
alleged
inconsistencies
between
public
testimony
of
the
witnesses
which
they
did
not
do
in
the
district
court.
and
we
think
that
the
transcript
reflects
and
quite
clearly
that
the
court
was
willing
if
there
had
been
or
any
real
attempt
made
to
have
them
examine
this
transcript
to
really
look
at
the
transcripts
but
no
real
attempt
was
made.
and
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
no
harm
could
possibly
be
done
to
petitioners
if
the
case
were
now
remanded
after
the
district
judge
look
at
those
minutes
to
certify
whether
there
were
inconsistencies
which
would
have
justified
any
motive
of
the
defense.
general
taylor
has
pointed
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
witnesses,
mr.
mason
died
between
the
first
and
second
trial.
well
all
what
that
means
is
that
the
district
judge
agreed
to
grand
jury
transcript
and
compares
it
with
the
testimony
of
the
first
trial
determines
whether
there
were
any
inconsistencies.
certainly
if
you
find
that
there
were
no
inconsistencies
that
doesn't
vitiate
this
conviction.
if
you
were
to
find
that
were
no
inconsistencies
then
the
petitioners
were
not
entitled
for
the
grand
jury
transcript
at
neither
at
the
first
trial
nor
the
second
trial
and
the
convictions
could
stand.
