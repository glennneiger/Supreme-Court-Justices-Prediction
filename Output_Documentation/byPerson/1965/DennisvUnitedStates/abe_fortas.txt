justice
abe
fortas
general,
you
get
any
comfort
out
of
rule
--
criminal
rule
16?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
the
rule
provides
that
--
first,
for
general
secrecy
and
otherwise
a
general
opinion
third
clause
[inaudible]
that
may
disclose,
that
is
the
current
judge
in
the
grand
jury
although
when
directed
by
the
court
preliminary
or
in
connection
with
the
judicial
proceeding
or
when
committed
by
the
court
to
the
effects
of
the
defendant
to
punish
her
and
grants
may
exist
or
mostly
in
dismissing
indictment
because
that's
prior
before
the
grand
jury
specific
part
being
the
power
given
to
the
court
in
--
really
without
much
qualification
in
connection
with
the
judicial
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
i
have
another
half
of
that
question
if
may
i
ask
you
and
that
is
this.
i
note
that
the
government
urges
that
if
we
go
along
with
you
in
your
attack
on
the
failure
to
examine
the
grand
jury
transcript
or
failure
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
this
defense
counsel
access
to
it,
that
proper
remedy
would
be
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
refer
this,
not
to
make
it
but
to
refer
it,
this
specific
matter
to
the
prior
judge.
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
your
prior
brief
you
don't
really
comment
on
that
except
to
express
your
opposition
to
it
and
i'd
be
very
interested
in
your
views.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that.
on
the
second
trial,
these
witnesses
grand
jury
testimony
was
granted.
justice
abe
fortas
i
remember
that,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
and
you
had
not
had
access.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
to
give
you
the
relief
that
you
want
if
that
witness
is
on
a
subsequent
trial
and
that
witness'
testimony
could
not
be
used
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
this
right
to
dismiss
the
case
for
this
as
fatal
error
for
all
the
time,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
point
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
indictment
here
specifically
refer
to
1001?
justice
abe
fortas
because
as
i
see
this
--
the
juror
saying
maybe
that
this
contained
--
the
specs
that
the
charge
here
is
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
the
united
states
of
the
services
of
the
nlrb
by
falsely
filing
an
--
by
filing
a
false
affidavit
under
9
(h),
and
i
don't
see
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
why
you
referred
to
1001
in
your
last
statements.
that
is
to
say
that
is
it
or
is
it
not
the
fact
that
the
fraud
that
you're
alleging
--
you
alleged
in
the
indictment
of
united
states
was
defraud
under
9
(h).
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
means
of
the
overt
act
was
the
--
at
least
one
of
the
over
acts
was
the
filing
of
this
false
affidavit.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
other
question
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this.
general
taylor
referred
to
the
question
as
to
whether
they
can
--
as
to
whether
the
constitutional
issue
is
presented
here
in
terms
of
the
standing
of
the
petitioners
to
raise
that
issue.
i
take
it
that
your
position
is
that
it's
not
the
question
of
standing,
it
is
the
question
of
the
irrelevancy.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
of
the
constitutional
issues,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
charging
a
conspiracy
under
371
to
the
defraud
the
united
states
by
means
of
filing
false
affidavit
with
purpose
of
obtaining
the
services
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
9
(h)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
to
defraud?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
question
there
is
not
whether
the
lawyers
committed
the
error
but
whether
the
court
committed
the
error
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
the
courts
got
the
power.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice

agree,
you
agree
to
that.
