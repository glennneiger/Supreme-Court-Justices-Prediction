mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
tenth
circuit
and
it
involves
appeals
from
judgments
of
conviction
for
the
crime
of
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
under
the
appropriate
clause
of
the
general
federal
conspiracy
statute,
18
u.s.
code
371.
now
the
nature
of
the
unlawful
conduct
which
this
case
involves
arises
out
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
old
taft-hartley
law
enacted
in
1947.
that
act
was
to
be
sure,
repelled
in
1959
and
its
successor,
section
504
of
the
labor
management
act
is
the
statute
that
your
honors
reviewed
in
the
archie
brown
case
last
year.
but
the
indictment
here
antedates
that
repealer
and
that
is
why
it
is
arising
under
the
old
law.
the
old
law,
section
9
(h)
was
before
this
court
in
appropriate
proceedings
to
test
constitutionality
in
the
douds
case
and
thereafter,
there
were
various
cases
involving
prosecutions
for
filing
false
affidavits,
the
jencks
case,
the
travis
case
and
various
others
that
who've
been
here.
so
i
take
it
that
the
court
is
generally
familiar
with
the
structure
of
that
law
which
required
that
officers
of
labor
unions
file
affidavits
denying
that
they
were
members
of
or
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
as
a
precondition
for
a
compliance
status
on
the
part
of
the
union
of
which
they
were
officers.
that
section
9
(h)
incorporated
as
a
sanction
for
filing
false
affidavits,
the
general
federal
statute
known
as
the
false
statements
act,
18
u.s.
code
1001.
so
that
the
penalty
for
the
false
affidavits
is
that
general
criminal
provision
rather
than
any
peculiar
provision
of
the
taft-hartley
law
itself.
mr.
telford
taylor
they
have
indeed.
this
is
the
--
there
have
been
two
conspiracy
prosecutions
mr.
justice
stewart.
one
in
the
west
case
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
here
and
this
is
the
other
one.
this
is
the
only
other
case
in
which
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
false
affidavit
provisions
has
been
charged.
now
the
petitioners
here
are
or
they
were
at
the
time
of
the
acts
charged,
officers
and
employees
of
the
international
union
of
mine,
mill
and
smelter
workers
which
referred
to
in
the
briefs
for
aviation
purposes
as
mine,
mill.
and
the
gist
of
the
charge
against
them
is
that
they
conspired
--
is
that
they
were
at
the
time,
members
of
the
communist
party,
and
that
they
conspired
with
each
other
that
those
among
them
who
were
officers
would
file
false
affidavits,
false
in
that
they
denied
communist
membership
when
in
fact
they
were
members
and
thereby
obtained
compliance
status.
i
should
add
that
of
the
six
petitioners
here
at
the
time
of
these
circumstances,
four
only
were
officers
and
actually
filed
affidavits.
the
other
two
were
employees
not
required
to
file
affidavits
but
charged
as
co-conspirators
along
with
the
four
who
did
the
actual
filing.
these
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
--
the
trial
was
in
the
district
of
colorado,
the
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
the
tenth
circuit.
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
on
a
number
of
grounds.
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
limited
to
three
questions;
the
first
being
the
statutory
sufficiency
of
the
indictment,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
allegations
in
the
indictment
sufficiently
make
out
a
charge
of
conspiracy-to-defraud.
secondly,
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h),
which
indeed
had
been
sustained
in
douds
but
which
as
we
suggested
in
our
petition,
the
authority
of
that
case
had
been
at
least
undermined
by
archie
brown
and
therefore,
the
question
of
constitutionality
was
ripe
for
reconsideration.
and
thirdly,
a
question
not
pertaining
to
indictment
but
to
the
trial
itself
and
that
is
the
denial
of
motions
that
we
made
at
the
trial
to
have
produced
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
government
witnesses
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
that
motion
is
made
in
the
alternative
either
for
the
production
direct
to
us,
the
defense
counsel,
or
failing
that
for
production
to
the
court
for
in
camera
inspection.
those
motions
were
denied
and
that
raises
the
third
question,
standing
generally
from
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
decision
of
--
several
years
ago.
now
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari
here
i
think
obligates
any
necessity
for
any
extended
statement
on
the
facts
in
the
evidence.
but
the
court
will
see
that
these
cases
of
a
certain
age
and
it
may
assist
a
little
bit
if
i
indicate
what
the
procedural
steps
had
been
and
why
it
now
appears
here
so
long
after.
the
--
under
statute
repealed
seven
years
ago,
the
indictment
is
a
1956,
ten
years
ago
and
as
the
indictment
shows,
the
overt
acts
and
the
initial
affidavits
filed
here
that
were
alleged
to
be
false
were
filed
as
long
ago
as
1949,
the
time
would
be
alleged
conception
of
the
conspiracy.
when
the
indictment
was
brought
that
the
defendants
of
whom
there
were
14
charged
in
the
indictment,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
various
grounds,
including
the
constitutional
ground
which
we
did
not
argue
below
because
the
lower
courts
were
then
have
been
bound
by
douds,
but
in
which
we
seriously
pressed
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
statutory
insufficiency
that
there
was
no
sufficient
showing
in
the
indictment
of
the
necessary
element
of
fraud.
that
motion
was
argued
before
judge
breitenstein,
he
was
then
the
district
judge
and
he
held
it
a
long
time
and
then
was
appointed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
without
deciding
the
motion,
he
referred
it
to
the
late
judge
niles
who
is
the
senior
district
judge
in
the
district
of
colorado.
judge
niles
heard
it
argued
a
second
time,
held
that
a
considerable
period
of
time
then
denied
it.
so
the
defendants
didn't
actually
go
to
trial
until
1959.
then
three
of
them
plead
nolo
contendere,
11
went
to
trial.
the
judge
dismissed
the
charge
against
two,
nine
were
convicted
and
we
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
judgment
was
reversed
on
the
ground
of
errors
in
the
admission
of
evidence.
mr.
telford
taylor
errors
in
the
admission
of
evidence.
inadmissible
evidence
pertaining
to
conspiracy
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
directed
the
equivalent,
two
more
defendants,
so
there
is
seven
left
and
the
seven
left
were
tried
the
second
time
in
1963.
the
jury
acquitted
one
more
and
the
six
remaining
are
the
petitioners
here.
i
should
add
that
following
the
decision
in
the
archie
brown
case,
we
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals,
alleging
the
new
grounds
but
that
was
denied.
now
the
evidence
is
summarized
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
but
i
think
i
need
not
advert
to
it
farther.
the
general
gist
was
a
period
of
noncompliance
followed
by
a
decision
that
compliance
was
necessary,
filing
of
these
affidavits
for
the
purpose
of
securing
compliance
and
that
really
is
the
whole
story.
the
rulings
of
the
trial
i
have
already
averted
to
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury
in
minutes.
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
i
hope
appropriate
affirmity
each
of
the
three
points
we
have
raised
in
the
petition
and
i
will
deal
first
of
course
with
the
points
relating
to
the
indictment
and
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
about
postponing
constitutional
questions
if
other
grounds
are
available.
i
will
first
discuss
the
statutory
point.
now
the
two
clauses,
the
18
u.s.
code
371,
the
conspiracy
statute
has
been
here
many
times
of
course.
it
punishes
the
conspiring
either
to
commit
any
offense
against
the
united
states
or
to
defraud
the
united
states
or
any
agency
in
any
manner
and
so
forth.
and
there
have
been,
over
the
years,
repeated
decisions
indicating
that
those
two
clauses
of
the
statute
are
not
mutually
exclusive,
but
they
are
distinct
that
they
are
in
part
overlapping
that
they
are
not
congruent
that
an
indictment
to
be
valid
under
that
statute
must
contain
a
proper
charge
of
either
one
element
or
the
other
or
both.
to
be
brought
under
the
offense
clause,
a
statutory
offense
must
be
charged
to
the
--
the
indictment.
to
be
brought
under
the
fraud
clause,
fraud
must
be
charged
as
an
element
of
the
offense
or
to
be
brought
into
both
you
must
have
both
elements.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
an
indictment
brought
in
the
language
--
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
quite
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
it
does
not
need
to
be
successful,
but
the
charge
must
embody
a
charge
of
intent
to
defraud
the
government
if
it
is
to
survive
under
the
foreign
clause
and
that
charge
must
be
substantiated
by
the
underlying
allegations
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
the
case
that
we
most
particularly
rely
on
in
this
connection
is
the
bridges
case
in
346
united
states.
now
the
bridges
case
in
this
application
here,
stands
for
two
propositions
which
we
think
are
governing.
in
the
first
place,
that
the
clause
invoked
by
the
government,
the
invocation
is
not
determinative,
the
government
cannot
make
out
a
case
under
the
fraud
clause
simply
by
saying
it
would
like
to
do
so.
simply
by
saying
conspiracy-to-defraud,
that's
not
enough.
you
must
look
through
to
the
substance
of
the
charge
to
see
whether
fraud
is
indeed
there.
and
the
second
thing
that
bridges
case
held
was
that
if
the
unlawful
element
in
the
conspiracy
is
indeed
a
statutory
offense,
then
it
will
not
lie
under
the
fraud
clause
unless
fraud
is
an
essential
element
of
that
offense.
in
the
bridges
case
itself,
the
charge
was
conspiracy-to-defraud
the
government
by
making
a
false
statement
and
a
naturalization
proceeding
and
the
court
held
that
default
statement
in
the
naturalization
proceeding
is
itself
statutory
offense
and
that
it
is
an
offense
whether
fraudulent
or
not
that
any
false
statement,
fraudulent
or
not,
is
punishable
under
that
statute.
and
therefore,
since
the
offense
constituting
the
unlawful
element
of
the
conspiracy
did
not
necessarily
involved
fraud,
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
had
not
been
made
out.
mr.
telford
taylor
we're
talking
indeed
about
the
citations
(voice
overlap)
we
are
talking
about
the
same
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
did
indeed,
yes.
it
did
involve
the
war-time
suspension
of
liabilities
act,
but
that
was
exactly
the
same
question.
if
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
were
properly
charged,
then
the
war-time
suspension
would
have
applied
and
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
have
run,
but
since
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
was
attempted
to
be
charged
but
unsuccessfully
charged,
the
war-time
suspension
act
did
not
apply
and
the
prosecution
was
barred.
that
is
i
think
with
all
respect
is
the
precise
holding
of
the
case.
now,
applying
that
here,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
statute
involved
here
is
18
u.s.
code
1001.
the
only
unlawful
thing
that
the
defendants
are
charged
with
doing
here
is
agreeing
to
file
and
indeed
filing
false
affidavits.
if
no
affidavits
have
been
filed,
there
would
be
no
conspiracy.
if
the
affidavits
had
been
true,
there
was
no
conspiracy.
the
only
unlawful
element
in
the
whole
picture
here
is
the
charge
that
these
affidavits
were
false.
now,
this
court
has
twice
said
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
repeatedly
held
that
under
18
u.s.
code
1001
fraud
is
not
an
essential
element.
this
came
up
for
a
recent
consideration
in
the
grainger
case
which
was
just
argued
together
with
bridges
and
decided
at
the
same
time
and
the
court
in
the
grainger
case,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
burton,
drew
the
distinction
between
the
so-called
false
claims
statute,
where
the
case
held
fraud
is
an
essential
element,
and
the
false
statements
act
involved
here
which
the
grainger
opinion
said
does
not
involve
fraud
as
an
essential
element.
therefore,
and
as
i
say,
there
are
many
lower
court
cases
holding
the
same
thing
that
fraud
is
not
an
element
under
the
false
statements
act,
we
say
here
that
the
government
has
indeed
endeavored
to
charge
a
conspiracy-to-defraud.
they
have
tried
to
invoke
that
clause,
but
all
they
have
actually
done
is
charge
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
and
fraud
is
not
an
element
of
that
statute
anymore
than
it
was
of
the
statute
in
bridges
case.
now,
may
i
point
out
one
other
quite
relevant
factor
here,
this
case
is
i
think
a
clearer
one
for
the
dismissal
of
this
indictment
than
was
bridges.
in
the
bridges
case,
one
could
and
indeed
the
government
did
argue
that
the
united
states
have
relied
on
the
truth
of
the
statement.
the
statement
alleged
to
be
false
there
was
that
bridges
in
the
course
of
naturalization
proceeding
was
asked
whether
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
said
no.
and
the
government's
position
was
that
in
reliance
on
that
denial,
the
government
naturalized
him.
that
cannot
be
argued
here
because
in
point
of
fact,
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
not
rely
on
the
truth
of
this
affidavit.
the
initial
procedure
before
the
board
was
indeed
that
they
would
pass
on
the
truth
or
falsity
of
these
affidavits,
but
your
honors
in
the
leedom
case
and
meat
cutters
case,
held
that
this
was
not
a
matter
for
the
board's
determination
that
all
that
the
board
was
interested
in
was
getting
an
affidavit
and
compliance
status
followed
whether
or
not
the
affidavit
was
false
or
true.
indeed,
the
prosecution
for
filing
a
false
affidavit
could
follow,
but
noncompliance
did
not
follow.
therefore,
nothing
so
far
as
the
board
was
concerned
hang-on
the
truth
or
falsity
of
these
affidavits
and
there
was
therefore
no
reliance
in
the
sense
of
a
fraud
prosecution.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
there
is
not
directly
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
is
possible
that
if
this
were
construed
as
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense,
that
some
of
the
initial
affidavits
would
now
be
barred.
there
are
complications
there
because
of
a
change
in
the
statutory
period
in
the
course
of
the
--
from
three
years
to
five
years
in
the
course
of
that
and
i
really
don't
think
it
is
pertinent
to
the
body
of
my
arguments.
i
would
prefer
not
to
get
into
it,
that
is
not
a
crucial
part
of
our
contention
here.
we
do
however
say
that
there
was
prejudice
but
we
are
not
making
a
purely
technical
argument
here
and
the
--
of
course,
i
never
know
whether
the
word
technical
means
in
argument
if
it
is
stronger
or
weaker,
but
we
do
feel
that
this
is
not
purely
a
form
of
proposition.
the
government
suggests
in
their
brief
that
there
is
no
real
prejudice
here,
but
we
suggest
there
is.
if
all
that
has
been
done
here
is
to
charge
the
defendants
with
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense,
and
the
government
addresses
that
up
with
fraud
language,
well
fraud
indictments
are
read
--
the
indictment
is
read
to
the
jury.
of
course,
juries
are
always
instructed
that
the
indictment
is
only
a
charge
and
not
a
proof
but
any
trial
a
lawyer
knows
that
what
the
jury
hears
from
an
indictment,
does
make
a
difference.
the
view
that
people
take
charges
of
fraud
is
very
different
in
the
view
they
take
of
some
kinds
of
offenses.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
situations
where
judges
in
sentencing
have
indicated
that
they've
view
a
charge
of
conspiracy-to-defraud
as
the
very
much
more
serious
one
than
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense.
so
that
in
all
of
those
ways,
prejudice
was
certainly
possible
whether
they
are
not,
then
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested,
there
may
also
be
a
statute
of
limitations
problem
too.
i
would
suggest
in
conclusion
on
this
point
that
there
is
also
a
general
policy
problem.
the
clause
of
that
statute
having
to
do
with
fraud,
that
is
the
conspiracy-to-defraud,
has
been
a
good
deal
criticized
in
recent
years
as
being
too
loose
and
imprecise
and
being
a
relic
of
days
when
conspiracy
concepts
were
not
as
tight
as
the
court
has
drawn
in
more
recent
years.
and
that
there
is
already
a
need
for
other
than
as
a
vague
catchall,
but
the
government
should
be
required
to
specify
a
statutory
offense
as
the
object
of
an
indictment.
and
however
that
may
be,
there's
no
suggestion
that
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
do
this,
but
we
don't
think
the
court
should
extend
the
application
of
the
fraud
clause
to
cases
clearly
covered
by
the
offense
clause
under
these
circumstances.
now,
i
would
like
to
pass
to
the
sector
of
the
points,
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h).
our
basic
argument
here
is
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
archie
brown
decision
that
there
is
no
meaningful
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
archie
brown
case.
the
archie
brown
case
was
decided
in
this
court
on
the
basis
of
the
bill
of
attainder
and
we
suggest
that
what
the
court
decided
there
is
plainly
applicable
here.
i
will
deal
in
a
moment
with
distinctions
which
might
suggest
it.
we
also
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment.
the
archie
brown
case
itself
was
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
on
the
basis
of
bill
of
attainder
but
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment
and
we
think
that
that
is
an
adequate
alternative
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
should
add
that
we
think
that
second
branch
of
attack
under
the
first
amendment
is
considerably
strengthened
by
the
decision
on
the
--
in
the
elfbrant
case
to
which
i'll
advert
in
a
moment.
the
court
has
so
recently
and
so
completely
reviewed
the
bill
of
attainder
concept
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
would
serve
any
useful
purpose
for
me
to
pursue
at
length.
the
basis
of
the
concept
as
a
particular
application
in
archie
brown.
i'm
aware
of
course
that
the
court
was
sharply
divided
in
the
archie
brown
case.
i
am
aware
too
that
the
--
and
the
constitutional
dimension
of
stare
decisis
is
not
as
often
respected.
nonetheless,
the
case
is
recent,
fully
considered
and
i
would
therefore
like
to
devote
my
time
to
possible
distinctions
rather
than
any
basic
reexamination
of
the
doctrine.
the
government
has
suggested
that
the
archie
brown
decision
is
not
applicable
because
in
that
case,
the
court
was
concerned
with
a
criminal
sanction,
section
504,
which
imposed
a
criminal
sanction
against
simultaneous
communist
membership
and
union
officership,
whereas
here
the
sanction
is
non-criminal
--
is
the
pressure
for
--
on
unions
who
wished
to
have
a
compliant
status
and
as
that
government
puts
it
the
discouragement
which
it
affords
to
communist
being
the
way
the
union
officers.
we
cannot
see
that
that
distinction
between
the
criminal
and
the
non-criminal
sanction
is
sufficient.
cummings
against
--
cummings
case,
ex
parte
garland,
the
lovett
case,
none
of
those
were
criminal
cases.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
brown
case,
that
is
the
distinction
between
a
criminal
and
another
sanction
should
be
governing,
nor
as
i
recall
it
that
is
suggested
in
the
minority
opinion.
the
majority
opinion
in
the
brown
case
did
suggest
the
different
distinction
and
that
is
that
in
9
(h),
one
could
lift
one
self
out
of
the
sanction
category
by
resignation
from
the
communist
party
whereas
in
archie
brown,
there
was
a
five-year
provision
so
that
an
immediate
resignation
would
not
have
resulted
in
lifting
the
ban.
the
court
did
point
that
out
in
the
douds
case
--
in
the
brown
case,
but
once
again,
the
majority
opinion
itself
suggests
that
that
may
not
be
a
sufficient
distinction
that
the
bill
of
attainder
concept
may
operate
whether
the
purpose
is
retributive
for
the
past
or
ameliorative
for
the
future.
the
government
as
far
as
i
can
see
has
not
advanced
that
as
a
suggestion
in
their
brief.
these
are
i
believe
the
only
two
possible
basis
for
distinguishing
this
from
the
brown
case
and
i
would
suggest
that
they
are
--
either
of
them
sufficient.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
believe
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
i
believe
so.
now
so
far
as
first
amendment
is
concerned,
may
i
point
out
what
i
believe
is
the
most
important
factual
circumstance
here
and
that
is
that
the
indictment
is
barren
of
any
charge
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
defendant's
communist
membership.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
they
knew
anything
about
the
aims
of
the
party.
there
is
no
suggestion
about
activity.
there
is
no
suggestion
about
intent.
therefore,
the
section
9
(h)
has
been
applied
throughout
and
i
think
must
be
regarded
today
as
a
statute
where
the
sanction
applies
to
bear
membership,
nothing
more.
in
the
scales
case,
you
have
the
element
of
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
purposes.
the
elfbrandt
case
decided
on
monday,
the
dissenting
opinion
does
indeed
make
much
of
the
fact
that's
in
the
statute
there
it
was
limited
to
members
who
knew
the
unlawful
purposes
of
the
organization.
there's
no
such
requirement
here.
the
sanction
applies
whether
or
not
there's
any
such
knowledge
or
any
degree
of
activity
or
intent
and
the
court
of
appeals
the
ninth
circuit
on
those
rounds
held
section
9
(h)
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
as
it
did
not
fulfill
the
requirements
stated
by
this
court
in
the
scales
case.
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit
decided
that
case
three
days
before
this
court
decided
the
aptheker
case.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
of
course
felt
bound
by
douds
and
therefore
felt
bound
to
distinguish
it
and
distinguished
douds
on
the
ground
that
that
was
a
criminal
--
that
that
was
a
non-criminal
sanction
whereas
504
is
criminal.
but
the
aptheker
case
which
came
down
three
days
later,
removed
i
suggest
the
basis
for
that
distinction.
there
was
no
criminal
penalty
there
either,
nor
is
there
in
the
elfbrandt
case.
so
again,
although
one
can
point
to
the
difference
between
the
criminal
and
the
non-criminal
treatment,
one
can
point
to
the
five-year
provision
as
differences,
it
does
not
seem
to
us
that
those
differences
are
meaningful
for
either
of
the
constitutional
arguments
we
are
advancing
here
today.
now,
the
government
does
however
advance
a
further
argument
with
respect
to
our
right
to
raise
a
constitutional
issue.
their
argument
is
that
since
the
charge
here
is
one
of
filing
false
affidavits
that
we
cannot
be
heard
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
they're
filed.
we
do
not
think
the
argument
is
substantial.
we
have
dealt
with
it
as
carefully
as
possible
in
our
reply
brief.
the
government
has
made
essentially
here
two
points.
first,
they
draw
an
analogy
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
say
that
if
a
man
has
on
the
stand
and
would
be
entitled
to
invoke
the
fifth
--
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
but
does
not
and
proceeds
to
ask
the
question
and
answered
it
falsely
he
can
be
indicted
to
perjury.
of
course,
we
don't
contest
that
proposition,
but
it
seems
to
us
wholly
extraneous
to
anything
here.
in
the
case,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
there
is
no
problem
of
the
authority
of
the
tribunal
to
put
the
question.
this
is
a
matter
of
personal
privilege
which
under
circumstances
of
possible
self-incrimination
gives
a
person
privilege
not
to
answer
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
authority
of
the
tribunal
to
put
the
question,
the
question
may
be
highly
relevant
to
the
testimony.
whereas
here,
the
whole
problem
is
whether
there
was
any
authority
to
demand
this
information
at
all.
the
government's
other
contention
here
is
based
upon
two
cases
decided
by
this
court
around
1933,
a
little
later,
302
u.s.
and
303
u.s.,
united
states
against
kapp,
united
states
against
kay.
these
were
cases,
one
under
the
homeowners
loan
act
and
one
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act,
where
the
defendant
had
gone
to
seek
a
bounty
from
the
government,
a
bounty
or
a
benefit
and
had
gotten
it.
he
got
a
benefit
payment
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
or
false
statement
have
been
submitted
to
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
as
a
basis
for
a
loan
and
the
court
said
there
that
having
done
that,
he
could
not
escape
a
perjury
charge
or
false
statement
charge
by
challenging
the
overall
constitutionality
of
the
aaa
act
or
the
home
owner's
loan
act.
well,
that
is
very
far
moved
from
our
situation.
this
is
no
case
where
the
defendants
have
gone
seeking
any
bounty
or
privilege.
the
labor
--
the
taft-hartley
act
was
a
regulatory
act
imposing
restrictions
on
what
unions
and
management
could
do.
the
douds
case
itself,
the
opinion
for
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
this
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
restrictive
statute,
not
one
conferring
any
benefits
on
those
subject
to
it
and
the
government's
position
really
amounts
to
this,
that
the
government
can
at
any
time
pose
a
demand
for
information
to
an
individual
and
force
him
to
the
alternative
of
either
disclosing
the
information
or
engaging
in
litigation
with
the
government.
no
matter
how
unconstitutional,
no
matter
how
unauthorized
the
demand
for
information,
the
defendant
can
be
put
to
that
choice.
well,
we
suggest
that
that
would
lead
to
very
arbitrary
and
oppressive
consequences.
we
have
detailed
our
argument
on
the
reply
brief
and
i
shall
leave
it
at
that
point
and
go
to
our
third
point.
i
am
now
away
from
the
validity
of
the
indictment
and
on
the
question
of
the
access
to
the
grand
jury
minutes.
this
question
of
access
to
grand
jury
minutes
of
government
witnesses
was
argued
here
a
few
years
ago
in
the
travis
case.
the
court
didn't
reach
it
because
the
case
went
off
on
grounds
of
venue.
the
problem
stems
from
the
court's
decision
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
and
the
ensuing
practice
in
the
circuit
courts
following
that
decision
which
has
been
far
from
uniform.
now,
as
we
understand
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
decision,
it
held
that
if
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
where
a
witness
has
testified
against
him
--
who
has
testified
against
him
has
also
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
if
the
defendant
requests
access
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
for
purposes
of
impeachment,
direct
the
access
by
the
defendant
is
conditioned
on
showing
of
particularized
need,
is
the
phrase
used
in
the
opinion.
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass,
the
contention
was
also
made
here
that
regardless
of
production
of
the
minutes
to
the
defendant,
that
they
should
have
been
produced
to
the
court
for
scrutiny
in
camera
to
decide
whether
anything
in
their
would
be
useful
for
impeachment.
the
court
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
didn't
raise
that
question
--
didn't
reached
that
question
because
apparently
the
contention
had
not
been
made
at
the
trial
and
therefore,
the
opinion
did
not
reach
it.
it
left
open,
whether
any
particular
showing
should
be
required
as
a
basis
for
in
camera
examination.
because
of
this
conceptual
dichotomy
in
the
opinion,
at
the
trial
in
the
present
case,
we
made
our
motion
in
the
alternative.
if
the
court
would
care
to
see
the
terms
in
which
the
motion
was
initially
made,
the
record
at
page
64
has
the
initial
colloquy
following
the
first
witness
and
it
will
be
seen
there
that
we
made
a
motion
in
the
alternative.
we
asked
first
that
the
witness
signed
and
testified
in
court
and
before
the
grand
jury
that
the
minutes
being
made
available
directly
to
us.
that
if
the
court
would
not
grant
that
motion
then
police
with
the
court
itself
examine
the
minutes
in
camera
and
turnover
to
us
any
minutes
which
they
thought
to
contain
testimony
that
would
be
useful
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
is
a
motion
with
respect
to
each
witness.
with
respect
to
--
i
think
all
but
one
of
the
witnesses,
the
motion
was
made
that
the
conclusion
of
the
direct
testimony
and
then
repeated
at
the
clause
of
cross-examination.
with
one
witness,
i
think
we
neglected
to
renew
it
at
the
close
of
cross
but
yes,
a
motion
is
made
in
each
instance
on
an
individual
basis.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
practice
in
the
lower
courts
in
situations
such
as
your
question
is
directed
to
has
varied.
there
have
been
practically
no
decisions
producing
the
grand
jury
testimony
directly
to
the
defense.
that
possibility
seems
to
have
disappeared,
but
with
respect
to
the
in
camera
examination
in
the
second
circuit,
the
practice
has
been
substantially
automatic.
that
if
a
government
witness,
a
prosecution
witness
has
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
defendant
asks
the
testimony
in
every
case
the
judge
will
look
at
it
and
see
whether
it
contains
anything
useful
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
in
the
second
circuit,
in
the
second
circuit.
no
indeed,
that's
not
the
practice
--
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
the
practice
in
the
other
circuits
has
varied
and
in
the
tenth
circuit
where
this
case
comes
from,
the
practice
has
been
highly
restrictive
and
grand
jury
minutes
have
not
been
turned
over
even
upon
the
showing
that
we
made
here.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
there
has
been
a
sort
of
median
approach
to
the
problem.
so
there
has
been
no
uniformity
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
may
think
it's
appropriate
if
it
should
reach
this
point
to
review
the
policy
factors
which
seemed
pertinent
here.
we
could
--
mr.
telford
taylor
in
our
case?
mr.
telford
taylor
well
mr.
justice
clark,
under
pittsburgh
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor
spoke
of
particularized
need
only
in
connection
with
production
directly
to
the
defense
and
did
not
lay
down
that
requirement
as
a
pretty
requisite
for
in
camera
inspection
by
the
court,
that
was
specifically
left
over.
therefore,
we
would
say
that
so
far
as
our
in
camera
request
is
concerned,
we
shouldn't
have
been
called
upon
to
show
particularized
need,
anymore
than
you
are
in
the
second
circuit
today.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
judge
has
to
do
that
with
statements
made
to
the
government
under
section
3500
today
and
the
pertinent
policy
factor
seem
to
us
very
--
they're
now
over
here.
if
a
witness
has
indeed
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
then
testifies
to
court,
it
seems
to
us
that
a
function
and
interpretation
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
right
of
confrontation
would
really
call
for
access
to
these
records
to
use
for
any
impeachment
purposes
that
they're
offered.
now,
however,
we
do
think
that
our
showing
a
particularize
need
here
was
adequate,
we
did.
the
colloquy
is
on
page
64,
there
with
respect
to
first
witness
and
argument
was
again
made
after
another
witness,
the
record
references
are
on
the
brief.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
discrepancies
between
the
testimony
is
given
on
the
second
trial
and
at
the
first
trial,
and
at
various
other
trials
where
the
same
witnesses
had
testified
involving
petitioner
travis.
there
had
been
separate
proceedings
involving
travis
before
this
at
which
some
of
these
witnesses
have
testified.
so
we
think
the
showing
of
particularized
need
was
in
all
respects,
adequate
and
indeed
if
i
read
the
government's
brief
correctly,
i
cannot
see
that
they
seriously
challenge
our
view
that
the
minutes
should
have
been
produced
for
in
camera
inspection.
we
think
that
there
is
a
strong
argument
to
be
made
for
production
directly
to
the
defense
that
it
would
be
one
thing
to
have
the
trial
judge
screen
the
testimony
to
eliminate
material
which
is
plainly
and
totally
irrelevant.
i
mean,
if
a
witness
has
been
called
to
testify
about
three
or
four
different
matters,
obviously
the
defense
only
needs
that
part
of
his
testimony
that
relates
to
the
case,
but
we
don't
think
it's
in
keeping
with
the
jencks
case
or
section
3500,
to
have
the
judge
pick
out
only
those
parts
of
the
testimony
that
he
thinks
are
material
--
are
inconsistent.
that's
a
decision
that
should
be
left
it
seems
to
us
to
the
trial
counsel.
mr.
telford
taylor
section
3500
does
not
in
terms
govern
the
situation
at
all,
no.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
i'm
not
your
honor.
there's
no
need
to
here
because
this
is
a
case
from
the
federal
courts
and
would
seem
to
us
a
statutory
and
supervisory
considerations
are
quite
sufficient.
i
did
suggest
--
mr.
telford
taylor
what
statutory
considerations?
there
are
no
statutes
relating
directly
to
grand
jury
problem,
your
honor,
no.
i
was
there
--
what
i
had
in
mind
there
was
the
--
mr.
telford
taylor
the
congressional
attitude
is
suggested
in
3500
which
seems
to
us
to
apply
by
analogy
here.
mr.
telford
taylor
pardon?
mr.
telford
taylor
the
purpose
of
3500
(voice
overlap)
yes,
it
seem
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
it's
a
statement
made
on
the
record
and
in
official
judicial
proceeding
for
the
grand
jury.
indeed,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
--
is
rather
more
eligible
for
submission
to
the
defense
even
than
statements
made
to
government
agents,
where
you
have
the
problem
of
verbatim
transcription.
section
3500
has
precipitated
all
these
problems
about
what
is
a
statement
and
what
isn't,
and
whether
a
thing
is
sufficiently
verbatim
to
be
legitimately
used
from
impeachment.
well,
you
don't
have
that
problem
here
because
you
got
a
closed
witness
on
a
graph
of
record.
it's
as
accurate
as
anything
can
be
and
this
is
the
case
where
there
is
no
real
interest
in
secrecy
left.
the
witness
has
been
exposed
in
the
sense
that
he's
been
produced
in
court
and
has
testified,
what
reason
is
there,
why
the
defense
shouldn't
have
access
to
that
testimony.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
perhaps
i've
misspoken
myself
justice
clark.
i
don't
at
all
mean
to
suggest
that
it
in
terms
governs.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
does
manifest
a
congressional
policy
that
defendant
should
be
given
access
to
certain
kinds
of
statements
useful
for
impeachment.
we
say
those
considerations
are
equally
applicable
to
grand
jury
minutes,
that
the
defendant
has
just
as
much
needed
them
and
for
the
same
reasons.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
i
wouldn't
think
that
there
is
any
question
about
the
power
of
the
court
to
do
this
and
the
rule
would
seem
to
bear
that
out.
i
do
right
now,
there
remains
a
problem
here
in
that
--
and
the
grand
jury
minutes
may
be
very
loose
in
subjects
they
cover.
there
may
be
need
for
some
kind
of
screening
on
materiality
but
not
on
inconsistency.
anything
material
to
the
case
it
seems
to
me
once
the
witness
has
testified
should
be
made
available.
the
only
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
revamp.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
the
very
matter
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
that
course
of
action
is
not
suitable
here.
it
would
be
suitable
if
the
court
should
decide
that
only
in
camera
inspection
is
called
for.
but
if
as
we
contend
this
is
a
case
where
a
particularized
need
has
been
shown
and
therefore
the
minutes
should
have
been
made
available
to
the
defense
directly
rather
than
for
in
camera
inspection.
obviously
a
remand
is
not
going
to
resolve
that
problem.
the
second
one
is
even
more
fundamental
and
that
is
that
one
of
the
four
witnesses
here
is
a
witness
who
testified
in
the
first
trial
and
then
died
and
his
testimony
was
read
at
the
second
trial.
now,
at
the
first
trial,
we
had
objected
--
i
beg
your
pardon
at
the
first
trial,
we
had
requested
his
grand
jury
testimony
and
had
been
denied.
there's
obviously
no
way
that
that
error
can
be
rectified
now.
so
we
say
for
those
two
reasons,
a
remand
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
it's
actual
testimony.
this
testimony
given
at
the
first
trial
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
was
granted
a
second
trial.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes
sir.
mr.
telford
taylor
right.
if
the
government
can
prosecute
the
case
again
without
this
witness,
that's
another
matter.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
would
like
to
deal
with
a
few
of
the
questions
that
the
court
put
during
the
government's
argument.
firstly,
with
the
questions
that
had
to
do
with
the
statutory
point
and
then
on
the
question
of
our
situation
with
respect
to
constitutional
contention.
and
may
i
begin
with
the
questions
that
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
especially,
were
putting
with
regard
to
why
this
indictment
was
brought
under
the
fraud
clause
rather
than
under
the
offense
clause.
we
deal
with
that
in
our
brief
at
page
19
and
the
explanation
as
i
think
reasonably
clear
and
the
sequence
not
without
interest.
i
mentioned
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that
there
was
one
other
conspiracy
case
like
this
one.
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
brought
under
the
offense
clause
of
the
conspiracy
statute.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes
and
the
sequence
is
that
this
indictment
in
our
case
came
in
november
of
1956.
in
december
of
1956,
this
court
decided
the
leedom
case
which
held
that
the
labor
board
didn't
have
any
interest
in
the
truth
or
falsity
of
these
affidavits.
and
the
west
indictment,
that's
the
other
conspiracy
case
was
brought
in
january
of
1957
and
was
brought
under
the
offense
clause
of
the
conspiracy
statute.
and
it
seems
to
us
clear
enough
that
the
leedom
case
underlying
the
doubts
which
we
thought
should
have
existed
before
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
an
indictment
under
the
fraud
clause
so
the
government
shifted
to
the
other
and
safer
clause.
now,
the
first
one
was
brought
under
the
fraud
clause,
we
believe
does
have
to
do
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
whether
it
would
have
been
successful
in
that
respect
isn't
that
matter
of
course,
but
the
court
did
say
in
the
grainger
case
that
the
statute
of
limitations
on
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense
cannot
be
any
longer
than
on
the
offense
itself.
well
some
of
these
affidavits
go
back
to
1949
in
the
indictment
and
not
until
1956.
so
there
obviously
was
a
problem
with
respect
to
statute
limitations
which
may
account
the
initial
indictment.
now
mr.
justice
stewart
i'd
like
to
go
on
with
the
question
that
you've
put
with
respect
to
this
indictment.
mr.
lewin
said
in
reply
to
your
question
that
this
indictment
is
not
brought
under
1001.
of
course
it
doesn't
refer
to
1001,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
however,
my
dimension
that
this
--
that
section
9
(h)
does
have
in
it
a
sanction
and
the
sanction
is
1001,
it's
incorporated
by
this
explicit
mention.
the
last
sentence
in
9
(h)
is,
the
provisions
of
sections
blank,
blank,
1001,
1022
and
1023,
shall
be
applicable
in
respect
to
such
affidavits.
so
that
there
is
a
built-in
incorporation
by
explicit
reference
to
1001
and
therefore
there's
not
a
slightest
difficulty
in
indicting
in
the
circumstances
for
--
under
the
offense
clause
as
well
as
under
the
fraud
clause.
now,
coming
back
to
the
bridges
case,
the
distinction
which
mr.
lewin
has
suggested
here
that
the
bridges
case
had
to
do
with
the
suspension
act
and
therefore
is
irrelevant
to
our
present
problem,
i
don't
think
would
stand
analysis.
mr.
lewin
says
that
if
the
suspension
act
haven't
been
involved
there
that
the
indictment
would
have
stood.
well,
there
are
other
cases.
the
hammerschmidt
case
decided
in
1926
involved
no
problem
with
statute
limitations,
no
suspension
act,
it
was
a
case
where
the
government
prosecuted
for
conspiracy-to-defraud
by
obstructing
registrants
from
military
service.
dismissed
as
a
failure
to
state
any
fraud
element,
no
statute
of
limitations
involved
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
haas
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
but
the
[inaudible]
case
i
think
shows
--
it
shows
--
it
seems
to
me
clearly
enough
that
regardless
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
statute
of
limitations
problem,
if
the
elements
aren't
made
out,
the
indictment
must
fail.
and
the
bridges
case
tells
us
that
in
determining
whether
fraud
is
made
out,
you
don't
look
simply
at
what
the
indictment
says.
you
look
at
what
is
in
it.
now,
mr.
lewin
has
said
there's
a
lot
more
in
this
indictment
beside
the
violation
of
10001.
and
of
course
there
are
indeed
a
lot
more
paragraphs,
but
the
only
unlawful
element
involved
here
is
the
false
affidavit
nothing
else
in
it
has
anything
to
do
with
an
unlawful
conspiracy.
indeed,
this
again
is
just
like
the
bridges
case.
in
bridges,
the
first
count
said
that
bridges
was
charged
with
conspiring
to
defraud
the
united
states
by
making
a
false
answer
and
thereby
getting
a
naturalization
certificate.
these
things
about
the
use
of
the
board
and
all
that,
they
are
the
normal
fruits
of
false
statement.
i
don't
suppose
anybody
makes
some
just
as
i
put
in
our
reply
brief
that
followed
it,
but
there
would
have
been
no
conspiracy
here,
there's
no
unlawful
element
at
all
other
than
the
false
affidavit.
and
that
is
an
offense
under
10001
and
fraud
is
not
an
element
of
it
and
this
court
had
said
so
repeatedly.
and
the
government
i
think
saw
the
--
saw
the
point
after
the
leedom
case
and
therefore
switched
to
the
other
clause.
now,
with
respect
to
our
constitutional
contentions
and
whether
we
can
bring
them
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas'
remarked
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
standing
but
of
relevance
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
government's
point
it
is
–
arguing
the
statutory
point,
says
that
10001
is
something
quite
different
from
9
(h)
and
when
their
argument
constitutional
point
says
--
said
that's
one
and
the
same
thing.
there
could
be
no
indictment
here.
there
would
be
no
compulsion
to
file
an
affidavit,
no
pressure
to
file
an
affidavit
but
for
9
(h).
no
affidavit
would
have
been
filed
but
for
9
(h).
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there's
any
problem
with
irrelevance.
now
the
kapp
and
kay
cases
do
say
that
under
the
circumstances
there,
the
defendants
were
not
entitled
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
those
statutes.
the
circumstances
though
i
suggest
were
quite
different.
in
the
kay
case
which
deals
with
this
problem
most
clearly,
involving
the
home
owners
loan
corporation,
the
defendant
indicted
was
--
the
charge
was
that
she
--
who
had
a
second
mortgage
on
property,
had
overstated
the
amount
of
that
mortgage
in
an
application
to
the
home
owners
loan
corporation.
the
court
said
that
her
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
entire
statute
would
not
lie.
that
since
she
had
sought
benefits
under
it,
she
was
not
entitled
to
raise
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
entire
scheme
of
home
owners
loan
act,
but
that
she
was
entitled
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
particular
sections
of
that
act
under
which
her
showing
to
the
government
had
been
made.
and
indeed
the
case
did
explicitly
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
sections
8
(a)
and
8
(e)
of
the
home
owners
loan
act
which
were
the
relevant
and
governing
sections.
it
was
only
the
overall
challenge
to
the
statute
which
the
government
--
which
the
court
would
not
hear.
this
part
of
our
argument
is
dealt
with
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
6
to
10,
and
may
i
just
burden
the
court
by
pointing
out
there
is
a
misstatement
on
page
8
which
renders
that
paragraph
meaningless
the
word
sanctions
should
be
situations.
the
kapp
and
the
kay
case
involved
situations
where
the
defendants
want
to
see
the
validity
or
benefit
from
the
government.
the
government's
position
does
amount
to
a
contention
that
when
an
unconstitutional,
unauthorized
inquiry
is
made,
a
person
must
either
disclose
or
litigate,
or
at
least
risk
litigation.
now
i
quite
agree
with
mr.
lewin
that
the
appropriate
and
best
kind
of
conduct
in
that
situation
is
indeed
to
disclose
or
to
challenge.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
to
hold
people
in
general
to
those
standards
is
utterly
unrealistic
and
highly
oppressive
in
this
potentialities.
this
again
we've
dealt
with
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief.
if
this
is
so,
i
don't
see
why
all
kinds
of
questions
clearly
put
to
people
in
some
of
these
forms,
service
on
juries,
racial
questions,
questions
of
religion
are
the
matters
quite
beyond
authorize
scrutiny
and
put
everyone
to
the
hazard
of
answering
truthfully
or
litigate
it.
it
seems
to
us
the
consequences
speak
for
themselves
and
the
--
this
court
shall
[inaudible].
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
tenth
circuit
and
it
involves
appeals
from
judgments
of
conviction
for
the
crime
of
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
under
the
appropriate
clause
of
the
general
federal
conspiracy
statute,
18
u.s.
code
371.
now
the
nature
of
the
unlawful
conduct
which
this
case
involves
arises
out
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
old
taft-hartley
law
enacted
in
1947.
that
act
was
to
be
sure,
repelled
in
1959
and
its
successor,
section
504
of
the
labor
management
act
is
the
statute
that
your
honors
reviewed
in
the
archie
brown
case
last
year.
but
the
indictment
here
antedates
that
repealer
and
that
is
why
it
is
arising
under
the
old
law.
the
old
law,
section
9
(h)
was
before
this
court
in
appropriate
proceedings
to
test
constitutionality
in
the
douds
case
and
thereafter,
there
were
various
cases
involving
prosecutions
for
filing
false
affidavits,
the
jencks
case,
the
travis
case
and
various
others
that
who've
been
here.
so
i
take
it
that
the
court
is
generally
familiar
with
the
structure
of
that
law
which
required
that
officers
of
labor
unions
file
affidavits
denying
that
they
were
members
of
or
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
as
a
precondition
for
a
compliance
status
on
the
part
of
the
union
of
which
they
were
officers.
that
section
9
(h)
incorporated
as
a
sanction
for
filing
false
affidavits,
the
general
federal
statute
known
as
the
false
statements
act,
18
u.s.
code
1001.
so
that
the
penalty
for
the
false
affidavits
is
that
general
criminal
provision
rather
than
any
peculiar
provision
of
the
taft-hartley
law
itself.
mr.
telford

they
have
indeed.
this
is
the
--
there
have
been
two
conspiracy
prosecutions
mr.
justice
stewart.
one
in
the
west
case
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
here
and
this
is
the
other
one.
this
is
the
only
other
case
in
which
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
false
affidavit
provisions
has
been
charged.
now
the
petitioners
here
are
or
they
were
at
the
time
of
the
acts
charged,
officers
and
employees
of
the
international
union
of
mine,
mill
and
smelter
workers
which
referred
to
in
the
briefs
for
aviation
purposes
as
mine,
mill.
and
the
gist
of
the
charge
against
them
is
that
they
conspired
--
is
that
they
were
at
the
time,
members
of
the
communist
party,
and
that
they
conspired
with
each
other
that
those
among
them
who
were
officers
would
file
false
affidavits,
false
in
that
they
denied
communist
membership
when
in
fact
they
were
members
and
thereby
obtained
compliance
status.
i
should
add
that
of
the
six
petitioners
here
at
the
time
of
these
circumstances,
four
only
were
officers
and
actually
filed
affidavits.
the
other
two
were
employees
not
required
to
file
affidavits
but
charged
as
co-conspirators
along
with
the
four
who
did
the
actual
filing.
these
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
--
the
trial
was
in
the
district
of
colorado,
the
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
the
tenth
circuit.
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
on
a
number
of
grounds.
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
limited
to
three
questions;
the
first
being
the
statutory
sufficiency
of
the
indictment,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
allegations
in
the
indictment
sufficiently
make
out
a
charge
of
conspiracy-to-defraud.
secondly,
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h),
which
indeed
had
been
sustained
in
douds
but
which
as
we
suggested
in
our
petition,
the
authority
of
that
case
had
been
at
least
undermined
by
archie
brown
and
therefore,
the
question
of
constitutionality
was
ripe
for
reconsideration.
and
thirdly,
a
question
not
pertaining
to
indictment
but
to
the
trial
itself
and
that
is
the
denial
of
motions
that
we
made
at
the
trial
to
have
produced
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
government
witnesses
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
that
motion
is
made
in
the
alternative
either
for
the
production
direct
to
us,
the
defense
counsel,
or
failing
that
for
production
to
the
court
for
in
camera
inspection.
those
motions
were
denied
and
that
raises
the
third
question,
standing
generally
from
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
decision
of
--
several
years
ago.
now
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari
here
i
think
obligates
any
necessity
for
any
extended
statement
on
the
facts
in
the
evidence.
but
the
court
will
see
that
these
cases
of
a
certain
age
and
it
may
assist
a
little
bit
if
i
indicate
what
the
procedural
steps
had
been
and
why
it
now
appears
here
so
long
after.
the
--
under
statute
repealed
seven
years
ago,
the
indictment
is
a
1956,
ten
years
ago
and
as
the
indictment
shows,
the
overt
acts
and
the
initial
affidavits
filed
here
that
were
alleged
to
be
false
were
filed
as
long
ago
as
1949,
the
time
would
be
alleged
conception
of
the
conspiracy.
when
the
indictment
was
brought
that
the
defendants
of
whom
there
were
14
charged
in
the
indictment,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
various
grounds,
including
the
constitutional
ground
which
we
did
not
argue
below
because
the
lower
courts
were
then
have
been
bound
by
douds,
but
in
which
we
seriously
pressed
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
statutory
insufficiency
that
there
was
no
sufficient
showing
in
the
indictment
of
the
necessary
element
of
fraud.
that
motion
was
argued
before
judge
breitenstein,
he
was
then
the
district
judge
and
he
held
it
a
long
time
and
then
was
appointed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
without
deciding
the
motion,
he
referred
it
to
the
late
judge
niles
who
is
the
senior
district
judge
in
the
district
of
colorado.
judge
niles
heard
it
argued
a
second
time,
held
that
a
considerable
period
of
time
then
denied
it.
so
the
defendants
didn't
actually
go
to
trial
until
1959.
then
three
of
them
plead
nolo
contendere,
11
went
to
trial.
the
judge
dismissed
the
charge
against
two,
nine
were
convicted
and
we
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
judgment
was
reversed
on
the
ground
of
errors
in
the
admission
of
evidence.
mr.
telford
taylor
errors
in
the
admission
of
evidence.
inadmissible
evidence
pertaining
to
conspiracy
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
directed
the
equivalent,
two
more
defendants,
so
there
is
seven
left
and
the
seven
left
were
tried
the
second
time
in
1963.
the
jury
acquitted
one
more
and
the
six
remaining
are
the
petitioners
here.
i
should
add
that
following
the
decision
in
the
archie
brown
case,
we
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals,
alleging
the
new
grounds
but
that
was
denied.
now
the
evidence
is
summarized
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
but
i
think
i
need
not
advert
to
it
farther.
the
general
gist
was
a
period
of
noncompliance
followed
by
a
decision
that
compliance
was
necessary,
filing
of
these
affidavits
for
the
purpose
of
securing
compliance
and
that
really
is
the
whole
story.
the
rulings
of
the
trial
i
have
already
averted
to
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury
in
minutes.
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
i
hope
appropriate
affirmity
each
of
the
three
points
we
have
raised
in
the
petition
and
i
will
deal
first
of
course
with
the
points
relating
to
the
indictment
and
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
about
postponing
constitutional
questions
if
other
grounds
are
available.
i
will
first
discuss
the
statutory
point.
now
the
two
clauses,
the
18
u.s.
code
371,
the
conspiracy
statute
has
been
here
many
times
of
course.
it
punishes
the
conspiring
either
to
commit
any
offense
against
the
united
states
or
to
defraud
the
united
states
or
any
agency
in
any
manner
and
so
forth.
and
there
have
been,
over
the
years,
repeated
decisions
indicating
that
those
two
clauses
of
the
statute
are
not
mutually
exclusive,
but
they
are
distinct
that
they
are
in
part
overlapping
that
they
are
not
congruent
that
an
indictment
to
be
valid
under
that
statute
must
contain
a
proper
charge
of
either
one
element
or
the
other
or
both.
to
be
brought
under
the
offense
clause,
a
statutory
offense
must
be
charged
to
the
--
the
indictment.
to
be
brought
under
the
fraud
clause,
fraud
must
be
charged
as
an
element
of
the
offense
or
to
be
brought
into
both
you
must
have
both
elements.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
an
indictment
brought
in
the
language
--
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
quite
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
it
does
not
need
to
be
successful,
but
the
charge
must
embody
a
charge
of
intent
to
defraud
the
government
if
it
is
to
survive
under
the
foreign
clause
and
that
charge
must
be
substantiated
by
the
underlying
allegations
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
the
case
that
we
most
particularly
rely
on
in
this
connection
is
the
bridges
case
in
346
united
states.
now
the
bridges
case
in
this
application
here,
stands
for
two
propositions
which
we
think
are
governing.
in
the
first
place,
that
the
clause
invoked
by
the
government,
the
invocation
is
not
determinative,
the
government
cannot
make
out
a
case
under
the
fraud
clause
simply
by
saying
it
would
like
to
do
so.
simply
by
saying
conspiracy-to-defraud,
that's
not
enough.
you
must
look
through
to
the
substance
of
the
charge
to
see
whether
fraud
is
indeed
there.
and
the
second
thing
that
bridges
case
held
was
that
if
the
unlawful
element
in
the
conspiracy
is
indeed
a
statutory
offense,
then
it
will
not
lie
under
the
fraud
clause
unless
fraud
is
an
essential
element
of
that
offense.
in
the
bridges
case
itself,
the
charge
was
conspiracy-to-defraud
the
government
by
making
a
false
statement
and
a
naturalization
proceeding
and
the
court
held
that
default
statement
in
the
naturalization
proceeding
is
itself
statutory
offense
and
that
it
is
an
offense
whether
fraudulent
or
not
that
any
false
statement,
fraudulent
or
not,
is
punishable
under
that
statute.
and
therefore,
since
the
offense
constituting
the
unlawful
element
of
the
conspiracy
did
not
necessarily
involved
fraud,
the
conspiracy-to-defraud
had
not
been
made
out.
mr.
telford
taylor
we're
talking
indeed
about
the
citations
(voice
overlap)
we
are
talking
about
the
same
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
did
indeed,
yes.
it
did
involve
the
war-time
suspension
of
liabilities
act,
but
that
was
exactly
the
same
question.
if
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
were
properly
charged,
then
the
war-time
suspension
would
have
applied
and
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
have
run,
but
since
a
conspiracy-to-defraud
was
attempted
to
be
charged
but
unsuccessfully
charged,
the
war-time
suspension
act
did
not
apply
and
the
prosecution
was
barred.
that
is
i
think
with
all
respect
is
the
precise
holding
of
the
case.
now,
applying
that
here,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
statute
involved
here
is
18
u.s.
code
1001.
the
only
unlawful
thing
that
the
defendants
are
charged
with
doing
here
is
agreeing
to
file
and
indeed
filing
false
affidavits.
if
no
affidavits
have
been
filed,
there
would
be
no
conspiracy.
if
the
affidavits
had
been
true,
there
was
no
conspiracy.
the
only
unlawful
element
in
the
whole
picture
here
is
the
charge
that
these
affidavits
were
false.
now,
this
court
has
twice
said
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
repeatedly
held
that
under
18
u.s.
code
1001
fraud
is
not
an
essential
element.
this
came
up
for
a
recent
consideration
in
the
grainger
case
which
was
just
argued
together
with
bridges
and
decided
at
the
same
time
and
the
court
in
the
grainger
case,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
burton,
drew
the
distinction
between
the
so-called
false
claims
statute,
where
the
case
held
fraud
is
an
essential
element,
and
the
false
statements
act
involved
here
which
the
grainger
opinion
said
does
not
involve
fraud
as
an
essential
element.
therefore,
and
as
i
say,
there
are
many
lower
court
cases
holding
the
same
thing
that
fraud
is
not
an
element
under
the
false
statements
act,
we
say
here
that
the
government
has
indeed
endeavored
to
charge
a
conspiracy-to-defraud.
they
have
tried
to
invoke
that
clause,
but
all
they
have
actually
done
is
charge
a
conspiracy
to
violate
1001
and
fraud
is
not
an
element
of
that
statute
anymore
than
it
was
of
the
statute
in
bridges
case.
now,
may
i
point
out
one
other
quite
relevant
factor
here,
this
case
is
i
think
a
clearer
one
for
the
dismissal
of
this
indictment
than
was
bridges.
in
the
bridges
case,
one
could
and
indeed
the
government
did
argue
that
the
united
states
have
relied
on
the
truth
of
the
statement.
the
statement
alleged
to
be
false
there
was
that
bridges
in
the
course
of
naturalization
proceeding
was
asked
whether
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
said
no.
and
the
government's
position
was
that
in
reliance
on
that
denial,
the
government
naturalized
him.
that
cannot
be
argued
here
because
in
point
of
fact,
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
not
rely
on
the
truth
of
this
affidavit.
the
initial
procedure
before
the
board
was
indeed
that
they
would
pass
on
the
truth
or
falsity
of
these
affidavits,
but
your
honors
in
the
leedom
case
and
meat
cutters
case,
held
that
this
was
not
a
matter
for
the
board's
determination
that
all
that
the
board
was
interested
in
was
getting
an
affidavit
and
compliance
status
followed
whether
or
not
the
affidavit
was
false
or
true.
indeed,
the
prosecution
for
filing
a
false
affidavit
could
follow,
but
noncompliance
did
not
follow.
therefore,
nothing
so
far
as
the
board
was
concerned
hang-on
the
truth
or
falsity
of
these
affidavits
and
there
was
therefore
no
reliance
in
the
sense
of
a
fraud
prosecution.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
there
is
not
directly
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
is
possible
that
if
this
were
construed
as
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense,
that
some
of
the
initial
affidavits
would
now
be
barred.
there
are
complications
there
because
of
a
change
in
the
statutory
period
in
the
course
of
the
--
from
three
years
to
five
years
in
the
course
of
that
and
i
really
don't
think
it
is
pertinent
to
the
body
of
my
arguments.
i
would
prefer
not
to
get
into
it,
that
is
not
a
crucial
part
of
our
contention
here.
we
do
however
say
that
there
was
prejudice
but
we
are
not
making
a
purely
technical
argument
here
and
the
--
of
course,
i
never
know
whether
the
word
technical
means
in
argument
if
it
is
stronger
or
weaker,
but
we
do
feel
that
this
is
not
purely
a
form
of
proposition.
the
government
suggests
in
their
brief
that
there
is
no
real
prejudice
here,
but
we
suggest
there
is.
if
all
that
has
been
done
here
is
to
charge
the
defendants
with
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense,
and
the
government
addresses
that
up
with
fraud
language,
well
fraud
indictments
are
read
--
the
indictment
is
read
to
the
jury.
of
course,
juries
are
always
instructed
that
the
indictment
is
only
a
charge
and
not
a
proof
but
any
trial
a
lawyer
knows
that
what
the
jury
hears
from
an
indictment,
does
make
a
difference.
the
view
that
people
take
charges
of
fraud
is
very
different
in
the
view
they
take
of
some
kinds
of
offenses.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
situations
where
judges
in
sentencing
have
indicated
that
they've
view
a
charge
of
conspiracy-to-defraud
as
the
very
much
more
serious
one
than
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense.
so
that
in
all
of
those
ways,
prejudice
was
certainly
possible
whether
they
are
not,
then
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested,
there
may
also
be
a
statute
of
limitations
problem
too.
i
would
suggest
in
conclusion
on
this
point
that
there
is
also
a
general
policy
problem.
the
clause
of
that
statute
having
to
do
with
fraud,
that
is
the
conspiracy-to-defraud,
has
been
a
good
deal
criticized
in
recent
years
as
being
too
loose
and
imprecise
and
being
a
relic
of
days
when
conspiracy
concepts
were
not
as
tight
as
the
court
has
drawn
in
more
recent
years.
and
that
there
is
already
a
need
for
other
than
as
a
vague
catchall,
but
the
government
should
be
required
to
specify
a
statutory
offense
as
the
object
of
an
indictment.
and
however
that
may
be,
there's
no
suggestion
that
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
do
this,
but
we
don't
think
the
court
should
extend
the
application
of
the
fraud
clause
to
cases
clearly
covered
by
the
offense
clause
under
these
circumstances.
now,
i
would
like
to
pass
to
the
sector
of
the
points,
the
constitutionality
of
section
9
(h).
our
basic
argument
here
is
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
archie
brown
decision
that
there
is
no
meaningful
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
archie
brown
case.
the
archie
brown
case
was
decided
in
this
court
on
the
basis
of
the
bill
of
attainder
and
we
suggest
that
what
the
court
decided
there
is
plainly
applicable
here.
i
will
deal
in
a
moment
with
distinctions
which
might
suggest
it.
we
also
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment.
the
archie
brown
case
itself
was
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
on
the
basis
of
bill
of
attainder
but
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment
and
we
think
that
that
is
an
adequate
alternative
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
should
add
that
we
think
that
second
branch
of
attack
under
the
first
amendment
is
considerably
strengthened
by
the
decision
on
the
--
in
the
elfbrant
case
to
which
i'll
advert
in
a
moment.
the
court
has
so
recently
and
so
completely
reviewed
the
bill
of
attainder
concept
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
would
serve
any
useful
purpose
for
me
to
pursue
at
length.
the
basis
of
the
concept
as
a
particular
application
in
archie
brown.
i'm
aware
of
course
that
the
court
was
sharply
divided
in
the
archie
brown
case.
i
am
aware
too
that
the
--
and
the
constitutional
dimension
of
stare
decisis
is
not
as
often
respected.
nonetheless,
the
case
is
recent,
fully
considered
and
i
would
therefore
like
to
devote
my
time
to
possible
distinctions
rather
than
any
basic
reexamination
of
the
doctrine.
the
government
has
suggested
that
the
archie
brown
decision
is
not
applicable
because
in
that
case,
the
court
was
concerned
with
a
criminal
sanction,
section
504,
which
imposed
a
criminal
sanction
against
simultaneous
communist
membership
and
union
officership,
whereas
here
the
sanction
is
non-criminal
--
is
the
pressure
for
--
on
unions
who
wished
to
have
a
compliant
status
and
as
that
government
puts
it
the
discouragement
which
it
affords
to
communist
being
the
way
the
union
officers.
we
cannot
see
that
that
distinction
between
the
criminal
and
the
non-criminal
sanction
is
sufficient.
cummings
against
--
cummings
case,
ex
parte
garland,
the
lovett
case,
none
of
those
were
criminal
cases.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
brown
case,
that
is
the
distinction
between
a
criminal
and
another
sanction
should
be
governing,
nor
as
i
recall
it
that
is
suggested
in
the
minority
opinion.
the
majority
opinion
in
the
brown
case
did
suggest
the
different
distinction
and
that
is
that
in
9
(h),
one
could
lift
one
self
out
of
the
sanction
category
by
resignation
from
the
communist
party
whereas
in
archie
brown,
there
was
a
five-year
provision
so
that
an
immediate
resignation
would
not
have
resulted
in
lifting
the
ban.
the
court
did
point
that
out
in
the
douds
case
--
in
the
brown
case,
but
once
again,
the
majority
opinion
itself
suggests
that
that
may
not
be
a
sufficient
distinction
that
the
bill
of
attainder
concept
may
operate
whether
the
purpose
is
retributive
for
the
past
or
ameliorative
for
the
future.
the
government
as
far
as
i
can
see
has
not
advanced
that
as
a
suggestion
in
their
brief.
these
are
i
believe
the
only
two
possible
basis
for
distinguishing
this
from
the
brown
case
and
i
would
suggest
that
they
are
--
either
of
them
sufficient.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
believe
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
i
believe
so.
now
so
far
as
first
amendment
is
concerned,
may
i
point
out
what
i
believe
is
the
most
important
factual
circumstance
here
and
that
is
that
the
indictment
is
barren
of
any
charge
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
defendant's
communist
membership.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
they
knew
anything
about
the
aims
of
the
party.
there
is
no
suggestion
about
activity.
there
is
no
suggestion
about
intent.
therefore,
the
section
9
(h)
has
been
applied
throughout
and
i
think
must
be
regarded
today
as
a
statute
where
the
sanction
applies
to
bear
membership,
nothing
more.
in
the
scales
case,
you
have
the
element
of
knowledge
of
the
unlawful
purposes.
the
elfbrandt
case
decided
on
monday,
the
dissenting
opinion
does
indeed
make
much
of
the
fact
that's
in
the
statute
there
it
was
limited
to
members
who
knew
the
unlawful
purposes
of
the
organization.
there's
no
such
requirement
here.
the
sanction
applies
whether
or
not
there's
any
such
knowledge
or
any
degree
of
activity
or
intent
and
the
court
of
appeals
the
ninth
circuit
on
those
rounds
held
section
9
(h)
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
as
it
did
not
fulfill
the
requirements
stated
by
this
court
in
the
scales
case.
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit
decided
that
case
three
days
before
this
court
decided
the
aptheker
case.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
of
course
felt
bound
by
douds
and
therefore
felt
bound
to
distinguish
it
and
distinguished
douds
on
the
ground
that
that
was
a
criminal
--
that
that
was
a
non-criminal
sanction
whereas
504
is
criminal.
but
the
aptheker
case
which
came
down
three
days
later,
removed
i
suggest
the
basis
for
that
distinction.
there
was
no
criminal
penalty
there
either,
nor
is
there
in
the
elfbrandt
case.
so
again,
although
one
can
point
to
the
difference
between
the
criminal
and
the
non-criminal
treatment,
one
can
point
to
the
five-year
provision
as
differences,
it
does
not
seem
to
us
that
those
differences
are
meaningful
for
either
of
the
constitutional
arguments
we
are
advancing
here
today.
now,
the
government
does
however
advance
a
further
argument
with
respect
to
our
right
to
raise
a
constitutional
issue.
their
argument
is
that
since
the
charge
here
is
one
of
filing
false
affidavits
that
we
cannot
be
heard
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
they're
filed.
we
do
not
think
the
argument
is
substantial.
we
have
dealt
with
it
as
carefully
as
possible
in
our
reply
brief.
the
government
has
made
essentially
here
two
points.
first,
they
draw
an
analogy
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
say
that
if
a
man
has
on
the
stand
and
would
be
entitled
to
invoke
the
fifth
--
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
but
does
not
and
proceeds
to
ask
the
question
and
answered
it
falsely
he
can
be
indicted
to
perjury.
of
course,
we
don't
contest
that
proposition,
but
it
seems
to
us
wholly
extraneous
to
anything
here.
in
the
case,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
there
is
no
problem
of
the
authority
of
the
tribunal
to
put
the
question.
this
is
a
matter
of
personal
privilege
which
under
circumstances
of
possible
self-incrimination
gives
a
person
privilege
not
to
answer
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
authority
of
the
tribunal
to
put
the
question,
the
question
may
be
highly
relevant
to
the
testimony.
whereas
here,
the
whole
problem
is
whether
there
was
any
authority
to
demand
this
information
at
all.
the
government's
other
contention
here
is
based
upon
two
cases
decided
by
this
court
around
1933,
a
little
later,
302
u.s.
and
303
u.s.,
united
states
against
kapp,
united
states
against
kay.
these
were
cases,
one
under
the
homeowners
loan
act
and
one
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act,
where
the
defendant
had
gone
to
seek
a
bounty
from
the
government,
a
bounty
or
a
benefit
and
had
gotten
it.
he
got
a
benefit
payment
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
or
false
statement
have
been
submitted
to
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
as
a
basis
for
a
loan
and
the
court
said
there
that
having
done
that,
he
could
not
escape
a
perjury
charge
or
false
statement
charge
by
challenging
the
overall
constitutionality
of
the
aaa
act
or
the
home
owner's
loan
act.
well,
that
is
very
far
moved
from
our
situation.
this
is
no
case
where
the
defendants
have
gone
seeking
any
bounty
or
privilege.
the
labor
--
the
taft-hartley
act
was
a
regulatory
act
imposing
restrictions
on
what
unions
and
management
could
do.
the
douds
case
itself,
the
opinion
for
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
this
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
restrictive
statute,
not
one
conferring
any
benefits
on
those
subject
to
it
and
the
government's
position
really
amounts
to
this,
that
the
government
can
at
any
time
pose
a
demand
for
information
to
an
individual
and
force
him
to
the
alternative
of
either
disclosing
the
information
or
engaging
in
litigation
with
the
government.
no
matter
how
unconstitutional,
no
matter
how
unauthorized
the
demand
for
information,
the
defendant
can
be
put
to
that
choice.
well,
we
suggest
that
that
would
lead
to
very
arbitrary
and
oppressive
consequences.
we
have
detailed
our
argument
on
the
reply
brief
and
i
shall
leave
it
at
that
point
and
go
to
our
third
point.
i
am
now
away
from
the
validity
of
the
indictment
and
on
the
question
of
the
access
to
the
grand
jury
minutes.
this
question
of
access
to
grand
jury
minutes
of
government
witnesses
was
argued
here
a
few
years
ago
in
the
travis
case.
the
court
didn't
reach
it
because
the
case
went
off
on
grounds
of
venue.
the
problem
stems
from
the
court's
decision
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
and
the
ensuing
practice
in
the
circuit
courts
following
that
decision
which
has
been
far
from
uniform.
now,
as
we
understand
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
decision,
it
held
that
if
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
where
a
witness
has
testified
against
him
--
who
has
testified
against
him
has
also
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
if
the
defendant
requests
access
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
for
purposes
of
impeachment,
direct
the
access
by
the
defendant
is
conditioned
on
showing
of
particularized
need,
is
the
phrase
used
in
the
opinion.
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass,
the
contention
was
also
made
here
that
regardless
of
production
of
the
minutes
to
the
defendant,
that
they
should
have
been
produced
to
the
court
for
scrutiny
in
camera
to
decide
whether
anything
in
their
would
be
useful
for
impeachment.
the
court
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
didn't
raise
that
question
--
didn't
reached
that
question
because
apparently
the
contention
had
not
been
made
at
the
trial
and
therefore,
the
opinion
did
not
reach
it.
it
left
open,
whether
any
particular
showing
should
be
required
as
a
basis
for
in
camera
examination.
because
of
this
conceptual
dichotomy
in
the
opinion,
at
the
trial
in
the
present
case,
we
made
our
motion
in
the
alternative.
if
the
court
would
care
to
see
the
terms
in
which
the
motion
was
initially
made,
the
record
at
page
64
has
the
initial
colloquy
following
the
first
witness
and
it
will
be
seen
there
that
we
made
a
motion
in
the
alternative.
we
asked
first
that
the
witness
signed
and
testified
in
court
and
before
the
grand
jury
that
the
minutes
being
made
available
directly
to
us.
that
if
the
court
would
not
grant
that
motion
then
police
with
the
court
itself
examine
the
minutes
in
camera
and
turnover
to
us
any
minutes
which
they
thought
to
contain
testimony
that
would
be
useful
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
is
a
motion
with
respect
to
each
witness.
with
respect
to
--
i
think
all
but
one
of
the
witnesses,
the
motion
was
made
that
the
conclusion
of
the
direct
testimony
and
then
repeated
at
the
clause
of
cross-examination.
with
one
witness,
i
think
we
neglected
to
renew
it
at
the
close
of
cross
but
yes,
a
motion
is
made
in
each
instance
on
an
individual
basis.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
practice
in
the
lower
courts
in
situations
such
as
your
question
is
directed
to
has
varied.
there
have
been
practically
no
decisions
producing
the
grand
jury
testimony
directly
to
the
defense.
that
possibility
seems
to
have
disappeared,
but
with
respect
to
the
in
camera
examination
in
the
second
circuit,
the
practice
has
been
substantially
automatic.
that
if
a
government
witness,
a
prosecution
witness
has
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
defendant
asks
the
testimony
in
every
case
the
judge
will
look
at
it
and
see
whether
it
contains
anything
useful
for
impeachment
purposes.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
in
the
second
circuit,
in
the
second
circuit.
no
indeed,
that's
not
the
practice
--
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
the
practice
in
the
other
circuits
has
varied
and
in
the
tenth
circuit
where
this
case
comes
from,
the
practice
has
been
highly
restrictive
and
grand
jury
minutes
have
not
been
turned
over
even
upon
the
showing
that
we
made
here.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
there
has
been
a
sort
of
median
approach
to
the
problem.
so
there
has
been
no
uniformity
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
may
think
it's
appropriate
if
it
should
reach
this
point
to
review
the
policy
factors
which
seemed
pertinent
here.
we
could
--
mr.
telford
taylor
in
our
case?
mr.
telford
taylor
well
mr.
justice
clark,
under
pittsburgh
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor
spoke
of
particularized
need
only
in
connection
with
production
directly
to
the
defense
and
did
not
lay
down
that
requirement
as
a
pretty
requisite
for
in
camera
inspection
by
the
court,
that
was
specifically
left
over.
therefore,
we
would
say
that
so
far
as
our
in
camera
request
is
concerned,
we
shouldn't
have
been
called
upon
to
show
particularized
need,
anymore
than
you
are
in
the
second
circuit
today.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
judge
has
to
do
that
with
statements
made
to
the
government
under
section
3500
today
and
the
pertinent
policy
factor
seem
to
us
very
--
they're
now
over
here.
if
a
witness
has
indeed
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
then
testifies
to
court,
it
seems
to
us
that
a
function
and
interpretation
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
right
of
confrontation
would
really
call
for
access
to
these
records
to
use
for
any
impeachment
purposes
that
they're
offered.
now,
however,
we
do
think
that
our
showing
a
particularize
need
here
was
adequate,
we
did.
the
colloquy
is
on
page
64,
there
with
respect
to
first
witness
and
argument
was
again
made
after
another
witness,
the
record
references
are
on
the
brief.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
discrepancies
between
the
testimony
is
given
on
the
second
trial
and
at
the
first
trial,
and
at
various
other
trials
where
the
same
witnesses
had
testified
involving
petitioner
travis.
there
had
been
separate
proceedings
involving
travis
before
this
at
which
some
of
these
witnesses
have
testified.
so
we
think
the
showing
of
particularized
need
was
in
all
respects,
adequate
and
indeed
if
i
read
the
government's
brief
correctly,
i
cannot
see
that
they
seriously
challenge
our
view
that
the
minutes
should
have
been
produced
for
in
camera
inspection.
we
think
that
there
is
a
strong
argument
to
be
made
for
production
directly
to
the
defense
that
it
would
be
one
thing
to
have
the
trial
judge
screen
the
testimony
to
eliminate
material
which
is
plainly
and
totally
irrelevant.
i
mean,
if
a
witness
has
been
called
to
testify
about
three
or
four
different
matters,
obviously
the
defense
only
needs
that
part
of
his
testimony
that
relates
to
the
case,
but
we
don't
think
it's
in
keeping
with
the
jencks
case
or
section
3500,
to
have
the
judge
pick
out
only
those
parts
of
the
testimony
that
he
thinks
are
material
--
are
inconsistent.
that's
a
decision
that
should
be
left
it
seems
to
us
to
the
trial
counsel.
mr.
telford
taylor
section
3500
does
not
in
terms
govern
the
situation
at
all,
no.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
i'm
not
your
honor.
there's
no
need
to
here
because
this
is
a
case
from
the
federal
courts
and
would
seem
to
us
a
statutory
and
supervisory
considerations
are
quite
sufficient.
i
did
suggest
--
mr.
telford
taylor
what
statutory
considerations?
there
are
no
statutes
relating
directly
to
grand
jury
problem,
your
honor,
no.
i
was
there
--
what
i
had
in
mind
there
was
the
--
mr.
telford
taylor
the
congressional
attitude
is
suggested
in
3500
which
seems
to
us
to
apply
by
analogy
here.
mr.
telford
taylor
pardon?
mr.
telford
taylor
the
purpose
of
3500
(voice
overlap)
yes,
it
seem
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
it's
a
statement
made
on
the
record
and
in
official
judicial
proceeding
for
the
grand
jury.
indeed,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
--
is
rather
more
eligible
for
submission
to
the
defense
even
than
statements
made
to
government
agents,
where
you
have
the
problem
of
verbatim
transcription.
section
3500
has
precipitated
all
these
problems
about
what
is
a
statement
and
what
isn't,
and
whether
a
thing
is
sufficiently
verbatim
to
be
legitimately
used
from
impeachment.
well,
you
don't
have
that
problem
here
because
you
got
a
closed
witness
on
a
graph
of
record.
it's
as
accurate
as
anything
can
be
and
this
is
the
case
where
there
is
no
real
interest
in
secrecy
left.
the
witness
has
been
exposed
in
the
sense
that
he's
been
produced
in
court
and
has
testified,
what
reason
is
there,
why
the
defense
shouldn't
have
access
to
that
testimony.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
perhaps
i've
misspoken
myself
justice
clark.
i
don't
at
all
mean
to
suggest
that
it
in
terms
governs.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
does
manifest
a
congressional
policy
that
defendant
should
be
given
access
to
certain
kinds
of
statements
useful
for
impeachment.
we
say
those
considerations
are
equally
applicable
to
grand
jury
minutes,
that
the
defendant
has
just
as
much
needed
them
and
for
the
same
reasons.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
i
wouldn't
think
that
there
is
any
question
about
the
power
of
the
court
to
do
this
and
the
rule
would
seem
to
bear
that
out.
i
do
right
now,
there
remains
a
problem
here
in
that
--
and
the
grand
jury
minutes
may
be
very
loose
in
subjects
they
cover.
there
may
be
need
for
some
kind
of
screening
on
materiality
but
not
on
inconsistency.
anything
material
to
the
case
it
seems
to
me
once
the
witness
has
testified
should
be
made
available.
the
only
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
revamp.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
the
very
matter
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
that
course
of
action
is
not
suitable
here.
it
would
be
suitable
if
the
court
should
decide
that
only
in
camera
inspection
is
called
for.
but
if
as
we
contend
this
is
a
case
where
a
particularized
need
has
been
shown
and
therefore
the
minutes
should
have
been
made
available
to
the
defense
directly
rather
than
for
in
camera
inspection.
obviously
a
remand
is
not
going
to
resolve
that
problem.
the
second
one
is
even
more
fundamental
and
that
is
that
one
of
the
four
witnesses
here
is
a
witness
who
testified
in
the
first
trial
and
then
died
and
his
testimony
was
read
at
the
second
trial.
now,
at
the
first
trial,
we
had
objected
--
i
beg
your
pardon
at
the
first
trial,
we
had
requested
his
grand
jury
testimony
and
had
been
denied.
there's
obviously
no
way
that
that
error
can
be
rectified
now.
so
we
say
for
those
two
reasons,
a
remand
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
it's
actual
testimony.
this
testimony
given
at
the
first
trial
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
was
granted
a
second
trial.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes
sir.
mr.
telford
taylor
right.
if
the
government
can
prosecute
the
case
again
without
this
witness,
that's
another
matter.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
would
like
to
deal
with
a
few
of
the
questions
that
the
court
put
during
the
government's
argument.
firstly,
with
the
questions
that
had
to
do
with
the
statutory
point
and
then
on
the
question
of
our
situation
with
respect
to
constitutional
contention.
and
may
i
begin
with
the
questions
that
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
especially,
were
putting
with
regard
to
why
this
indictment
was
brought
under
the
fraud
clause
rather
than
under
the
offense
clause.
we
deal
with
that
in
our
brief
at
page
19
and
the
explanation
as
i
think
reasonably
clear
and
the
sequence
not
without
interest.
i
mentioned
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that
there
was
one
other
conspiracy
case
like
this
one.
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
brought
under
the
offense
clause
of
the
conspiracy
statute.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes
and
the
sequence
is
that
this
indictment
in
our
case
came
in
november
of
1956.
in
december
of
1956,
this
court
decided
the
leedom
case
which
held
that
the
labor
board
didn't
have
any
interest
in
the
truth
or
falsity
of
these
affidavits.
and
the
west
indictment,
that's
the
other
conspiracy
case
was
brought
in
january
of
1957
and
was
brought
under
the
offense
clause
of
the
conspiracy
statute.
and
it
seems
to
us
clear
enough
that
the
leedom
case
underlying
the
doubts
which
we
thought
should
have
existed
before
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
an
indictment
under
the
fraud
clause
so
the
government
shifted
to
the
other
and
safer
clause.
now,
the
first
one
was
brought
under
the
fraud
clause,
we
believe
does
have
to
do
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
whether
it
would
have
been
successful
in
that
respect
isn't
that
matter
of
course,
but
the
court
did
say
in
the
grainger
case
that
the
statute
of
limitations
on
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense
cannot
be
any
longer
than
on
the
offense
itself.
well
some
of
these
affidavits
go
back
to
1949
in
the
indictment
and
not
until
1956.
so
there
obviously
was
a
problem
with
respect
to
statute
limitations
which
may
account
the
initial
indictment.
now
mr.
justice
stewart
i'd
like
to
go
on
with
the
question
that
you've
put
with
respect
to
this
indictment.
mr.
lewin
said
in
reply
to
your
question
that
this
indictment
is
not
brought
under
1001.
of
course
it
doesn't
refer
to
1001,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
however,
my
dimension
that
this
--
that
section
9
(h)
does
have
in
it
a
sanction
and
the
sanction
is
1001,
it's
incorporated
by
this
explicit
mention.
the
last
sentence
in
9
(h)
is,
the
provisions
of
sections
blank,
blank,
1001,
1022
and
1023,
shall
be
applicable
in
respect
to
such
affidavits.
so
that
there
is
a
built-in
incorporation
by
explicit
reference
to
1001
and
therefore
there's
not
a
slightest
difficulty
in
indicting
in
the
circumstances
for
--
under
the
offense
clause
as
well
as
under
the
fraud
clause.
now,
coming
back
to
the
bridges
case,
the
distinction
which
mr.
lewin
has
suggested
here
that
the
bridges
case
had
to
do
with
the
suspension
act
and
therefore
is
irrelevant
to
our
present
problem,
i
don't
think
would
stand
analysis.
mr.
lewin
says
that
if
the
suspension
act
haven't
been
involved
there
that
the
indictment
would
have
stood.
well,
there
are
other
cases.
the
hammerschmidt
case
decided
in
1926
involved
no
problem
with
statute
limitations,
no
suspension
act,
it
was
a
case
where
the
government
prosecuted
for
conspiracy-to-defraud
by
obstructing
registrants
from
military
service.
dismissed
as
a
failure
to
state
any
fraud
element,
no
statute
of
limitations
involved
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
haas
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
but
the
[inaudible]
case
i
think
shows
--
it
shows
--
it
seems
to
me
clearly
enough
that
regardless
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
statute
of
limitations
problem,
if
the
elements
aren't
made
out,
the
indictment
must
fail.
and
the
bridges
case
tells
us
that
in
determining
whether
fraud
is
made
out,
you
don't
look
simply
at
what
the
indictment
says.
you
look
at
what
is
in
it.
now,
mr.
lewin
has
said
there's
a
lot
more
in
this
indictment
beside
the
violation
of
10001.
and
of
course
there
are
indeed
a
lot
more
paragraphs,
but
the
only
unlawful
element
involved
here
is
the
false
affidavit
nothing
else
in
it
has
anything
to
do
with
an
unlawful
conspiracy.
indeed,
this
again
is
just
like
the
bridges
case.
in
bridges,
the
first
count
said
that
bridges
was
charged
with
conspiring
to
defraud
the
united
states
by
making
a
false
answer
and
thereby
getting
a
naturalization
certificate.
these
things
about
the
use
of
the
board
and
all
that,
they
are
the
normal
fruits
of
false
statement.
i
don't
suppose
anybody
makes
some
just
as
i
put
in
our
reply
brief
that
followed
it,
but
there
would
have
been
no
conspiracy
here,
there's
no
unlawful
element
at
all
other
than
the
false
affidavit.
and
that
is
an
offense
under
10001
and
fraud
is
not
an
element
of
it
and
this
court
had
said
so
repeatedly.
and
the
government
i
think
saw
the
--
saw
the
point
after
the
leedom
case
and
therefore
switched
to
the
other
clause.
now,
with
respect
to
our
constitutional
contentions
and
whether
we
can
bring
them
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas'
remarked
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
standing
but
of
relevance
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
government's
point
it
is
–
arguing
the
statutory
point,
says
that
10001
is
something
quite
different
from
9
(h)
and
when
their
argument
constitutional
point
says
--
said
that's
one
and
the
same
thing.
there
could
be
no
indictment
here.
there
would
be
no
compulsion
to
file
an
affidavit,
no
pressure
to
file
an
affidavit
but
for
9
(h).
no
affidavit
would
have
been
filed
but
for
9
(h).
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there's
any
problem
with
irrelevance.
now
the
kapp
and
kay
cases
do
say
that
under
the
circumstances
there,
the
defendants
were
not
entitled
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
those
statutes.
the
circumstances
though
i
suggest
were
quite
different.
in
the
kay
case
which
deals
with
this
problem
most
clearly,
involving
the
home
owners
loan
corporation,
the
defendant
indicted
was
--
the
charge
was
that
she
--
who
had
a
second
mortgage
on
property,
had
overstated
the
amount
of
that
mortgage
in
an
application
to
the
home
owners
loan
corporation.
the
court
said
that
her
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
entire
statute
would
not
lie.
that
since
she
had
sought
benefits
under
it,
she
was
not
entitled
to
raise
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
entire
scheme
of
home
owners
loan
act,
but
that
she
was
entitled
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
particular
sections
of
that
act
under
which
her
showing
to
the
government
had
been
made.
and
indeed
the
case
did
explicitly
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
sections
8
(a)
and
8
(e)
of
the
home
owners
loan
act
which
were
the
relevant
and
governing
sections.
it
was
only
the
overall
challenge
to
the
statute
which
the
government
--
which
the
court
would
not
hear.
this
part
of
our
argument
is
dealt
with
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
6
to
10,
and
may
i
just
burden
the
court
by
pointing
out
there
is
a
misstatement
on
page
8
which
renders
that
paragraph
meaningless
the
word
sanctions
should
be
situations.
the
kapp
and
the
kay
case
involved
situations
where
the
defendants
want
to
see
the
validity
or
benefit
from
the
government.
the
government's
position
does
amount
to
a
contention
that
when
an
unconstitutional,
unauthorized
inquiry
is
made,
a
person
must
either
disclose
or
litigate,
or
at
least
risk
litigation.
now
i
quite
agree
with
mr.
lewin
that
the
appropriate
and
best
kind
of
conduct
in
that
situation
is
indeed
to
disclose
or
to
challenge.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
to
hold
people
in
general
to
those
standards
is
utterly
unrealistic
and
highly
oppressive
in
this
potentialities.
this
again
we've
dealt
with
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief.
if
this
is
so,
i
don't
see
why
all
kinds
of
questions
clearly
put
to
people
in
some
of
these
forms,
service
on
juries,
racial
questions,
questions
of
religion
are
the
matters
quite
beyond
authorize
scrutiny
and
put
everyone
to
the
hazard
of
answering
truthfully
or
litigate
it.
it
seems
to
us
the
consequences
speak
for
themselves
and
the
--
this
court
shall
[inaudible].
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
