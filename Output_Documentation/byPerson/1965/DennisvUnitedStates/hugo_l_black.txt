justice

suppose
this
affidavit
--
suppose
this
law
had
required
that
the
prerequisite
getting
attention
by
the
union,
by
the
board?
the
union
swears
that
it
has
nobody
in
it,
they
believed
in
the
christian
religion
and
they
must
state
that
they
do
not
believe
in
the
christian
religion.
are
you
saying
that
under
those
circumstances
if
they
filed
a
false
statement
they
could
be
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
let's
assume
that
i
don't
know
which
position
you
are
taking
for
the
government,
let's
assume
that
such
a
requirement
would
be
void
under
the
first
amendment.
is
it
your
position
that
even
then
they
could
be
tried
for
perjury
if
they
are
tried
for
what
you're
trying
them
here
for
confers
to
the
committed
perjury,
if
they
had
sworn
falsely
of
that
legit
leave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
now
that
it
is
void,
the
law
is
void.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
--
which
will
be
charged
there
--
would
be
given
the
government
the
wrong
information
with
reference
to
their
religious
beliefs
and
we're
assuming
now
that
the
government
doesn't
have
the
right
to
make
any
such
inquiry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
answer
would
be
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
did
answer
through
here
and
then
you
could
try
them
for
perjury
even
though
it
was
inquired
--
requiring
them
to
do
something
which
the
constitution
forbade.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
talking
about
the
coercion
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
but
the
law.
i'm
not
saying
if
the
government
could
have
[inaudible]
they
just
passed
the
law
until
you've
got
to
do
it
or
as
you
go
to
jail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
--
do
you
have
to
make
them
draw
and
guess
about
that,
those
answers
and
then
they
can
be
tried
even
though
they
couldn't
be
tried
for
not
answering
it
at
all,
because
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
was
just
trying
to
find
that
if
that
was
your
first
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
if
he
didn't
answer,
i'd
assume
he
could
be
tried
or
commit
a
--
convicted
of
a
crime,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
this
particular
one
but
it
would
mean
the
same
thing
if
it
was
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
held
that
in
reference
to
questions
involving
first
amendment
for
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
conceive
that
there's
any
difference
in
that
kind
of
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
exact
fraud
of
things
in
crimes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
fraud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
was
that
--
that
this
fraud
occurred,
is
he
just
violated
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
violated
the
act
in
itself
is
due
to
fraud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
that
the
government
was,
wasn't
it,
to
prevent
itself
from
being
defrauded
with
that
false
affidavits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
he
has
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
government
are
you
making
again
the
false
affidavits
and
all
that
--
use
the
labor
board
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
for
all
who
stood
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
conspire
--
could
you
convict
him
for
using
the
labor
board
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
what
--
what
if
he
called
filing
up
one
offense
to
one
another
and
then
on
another
and
then
on
another,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
there
trouble
that
you
are
afraid
you
couldn't
convict
them
in
this
statute
because
it's
unconstitutional
and
you
end
this
other
to
--
to
get
around.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
you
get
in
the
area
of
the
trouble
we've
had
by
the
old
black-burger
doctrine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
like
it's
making
it
as
an
essential
part
of
your
crime,
you
couldn't
convict
him
without
proving
a
violation
of
9
(h),
could
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
and
that's
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
prohibit
this.
so
what
you're
doing
is
taking
a
--
an
essential
--
making
it
as
an
essential
part
of
your
crime
and
just
adding
another
word
used
dramatical
words
to
it,
that
fraud
and
said,
we
construed
it
up,
maybe
we
can't
constitute
him
under
this
or
do
you
admit
that
you
can't
do
it
practical,
don't
you?
under
the
latest
case,
you
certainly
made
it
and
you
take
an
essential
fact,
something
that
you've
got
to
prove
and
you
can't
convict
him
without
it
and
if
you'd
known
that
that
essential
part
is
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
you
convict
without
that
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i',
talking
was
the
--
if
9
(h)
was
not
on
the
book,
you
still
say
you
could
convict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
if
it's
on
the
book
and
unconstitutional,
you
can?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
demand
if
the
act
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
about
the
hypothetical
case
which
seems
to
me
it
might
get
what
you
are
arguing,
i
may
be
wrong.
suppose
the
government
would
it
make
it
a
crime,
murder
--
to
murder
a
government
employee
and
that
was
held
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
they
have
the
right

the
statement.
the
government
then
has
the
statute
that
said
if
you
defraud
it
of
the
services
of
its
employees
and
be
convicted
of
a
crime,
punishable
just

suppose
that

they
did
exactly
this
man
on

that
if
he'd
done
this
to
defraud
the
government

defrauded
the
government
or
the
use

its
own

could
he
be

then?

the

if
[inaudible]
services
and
you
could
allege
that
that's
what
he
did
of

justice
hugo
l.

no,
but
he
did
it
to
defraud
the
government
of
his
services,
they
charge
it
and
made
it
a
crime.
justice

you

up
in
crimes
like

what
