mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
question
of
discrimination
and
that
is
the
commissioner's
discrimination
against
these
accrual
basis
ranch
payers
who
use
the
unit-livestock-price
method
to
value
their
inventory.
now,
the
problem
in
this
case
and
a
great
danger
is
that
we
get
so
involved
in
these
treasury
regulations,
the
statutes,
these
treasury
decisions
that
we
will
lose
sight
on
the
fundamental
issue.
now,
that
issue,
what
is
it?
we
submit
the
issue
is,
can
the
commissioner
by
regulation
deny
these
taxpayers
the
full
benefits
of
a
statute
which
was
intended
as
a
relief
measure
applicable
alike
to
all
taxpayers?
now,
the
statute
clearly
says
that
livestock
--
breeding
livestock
are
properly
used
in
trade
or
business.
the
statute
also
says
that
it
if
it's
property
used
in
trade
or
business,
it's
not
properly
includable
in
the
inventory.
the
regulation
however,
1.471-6
(f)
requires
the
taxpayers
to
include
this
livestock
in
the
inventory.
now
the
question
is,
does
the
regulation
contravene
the
statute?
now
historically,
the
commissioner's
continually
attempted
to
defeat
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
yes
sir,
when
you
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
yes
sir.
to
my
knowledge
it
is.
historically
the
commissioner
has
attempted
to
deny
the
benefits
of
the
statute
to
the
livestock
industry.
the
statute
was
originally
passed
in
1942.
it
authorized
capital
gains
on
property
used
in
trade
or
business.
now
livestock
weren't
specifically
mentioned.but
since
they
had
all
the
characteristics
of
property
used
in
the
trade
or
business,
when
the
farmer
or
rancher
began
to
sell
them,
they
claim
capital
gains.
now
the
first
case,
the
albright
case
was
decided
in
march
of
1949.
in
that
case,
the
commissioner
attempts
to
deny
it
to
the
cash-basis
taxpayer.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
rejected
that.
then,
the
tax
court
followed
within
the
fawn
lake
case
where
the
commissioner
attempted
to
deny
it
to
the
accrual-basis
taxpayer.
finally,
in
the
bennett
case
decided
in
june
of
1951,
the
commissioner
in
that
case
was
ordering
that
all
livestock
are
held
primarily
for
sale,
they
never
can
qualify
for
capital
gain
treatment.
the
fifth
circuit
rejected
the
commissioner's
argument.
thereafter,
the
commissioner
issued
a
mimeograph
6660,
and
he
said
he
would
follow
albright
and
bennett.
but
for
the
first
time
he
says
that
he
is
going
to
deny
the
benefits
of
the
section
to
young
animals.
well,
at
this
point
congress
had
to
intervene,
they
amended
the
statute,
they
said
it
specifically
to
define,
to
draft
dairy
and
breeding
livestock
regardless
of
age.
yet
in
--
subsequently,
in
1954,
we
find
the
commissioner
in
the
mcdonald
case
trying
to
impose
new
standards
of
age
and
reproductivity
on
young
animals
and
this
was
rejected
by
the
second
circuit.
now,
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
in
the
wardlaw
case
as
pointed
out,
the
commissioner
has
continually
shifted
his
position
in
this
case
and
in
all
of
this
historical
development.
according
to
the
government's
theory
now
the
regulation
had
apparently
changed
from
the
time
it
was
--
that
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
until
when
it
reached
the
supreme
court.
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
regulation
required
the
inclusion
of
all
these
raise
breeding
animals
in
the
inventory.
but
in
brief,
in
oral
argument
before
this
court,
the
government
says,
“no.
all
that's
required
is
the
taxpayer
has
to
accumulate
the
cost
of
raising
animals.”
this
is
the
government's
ultimate
position.
i
submit
that
it
must
fail.
as
mr.
gregory
has
pointed
out,
then
regulation
471-6
(f)
conflicts
with
regulation
162-12
which
was
promulgated
back
in
the
early
20's.
and
through
this
document
statutory
enactment
has
achieved
the
force
of
law.
now,
i
submit
though
that
the
regulation
thus
require
the
inclusions
of
breeding
animals
in
the
inventory.
in
the
first
place,
the
government
stipulated
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court
that
the
taxpayers
were
required
to
include
these
animals
in
the
inventory
in
accordance
with
this
treasury
regulation.
now
if
the
taxpayers
were
required
to
do
this
they
didn't
do
it
voluntarily.
also,
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
question,
lewis,
ekberg,
catto
and
wardlaw
has
concluded
that
the
regulation
makes
this
requirement.
now,
to
really
understand
the
problem
involved
it's
necessary
to
consider
fundamentals
of
federal
income
taxation
of
ranchers.
now,
we
must
distinguish
i
think
between
fundamentals
of
income
taxation
and
general
principles
of
accounting,
that
these
are
not
the
same.
for
example,
taxpayer
in
the
oil
and
gas
business
is
permitted
by
election
to
expense
or
capitalize
intangible
drilling
cost.
clearly,
from
an
accounting
standpoint
these
are
capital
expenditures.
they
are
costs
of
acquiring
an
asset.
but
for
income
tax
purposes,
the
taxpayer
had
his
election,
can
treat
them
as
an
expense.
now,
suppose
the
commissioner
would
now
pass
a
regulation
and
say
that
accrual-basis
oil
and
gas
operators
are
required
to
include
all
wells
in
the
inventory,
in
other
words
the
section
1231
asset,
property
used
in
the
trade
or
business
in
the
inventory.
now,
i
don't
believe
this
court
would
have
any
difficulty
reaching
their
conclusion
that
that
regulation
is
invalid.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
a
statute
and
a
regulation.
the
statute
--
it's
granted
generally
in
the
regulations
(inaudible).
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
1231
we
contend
grants
us
capital
gain.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
no
sir,
that
--
that's
not
involved
in
connection
with
that
but
the
regulation
1.162-12
says
that
all
farmers
--
it
doesn't
say
that
cash
basis
can
or
an
accrual
basis
can.
it
says
all
farmers
can
deduct
the
cost
of
raising
their
animals.
now
briefly,
let
us
consider
the
cash-basis
taxpayer
and
the
accrual-basis
taxpayer
insofar
as
the
ranchers.
now
cash-basis
taxpayer,
he
reports
his
income
as
he
receives
it
and
he
deducts
his
expenses
as
he
pays
them.
now
he
is
permitted
to
deduct
the
cost
of
raising
his
livestock.
and
he
is
not
required
to
maintain
any
inventory.
he
is
not
required
to
include
in
his
ordinary
income
the
value
of
his
livestock.
and
when
he
sells
his
1231
assets,
breeding
livestock,
he
gets
capital
gains
on
the
entire
sales
price.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
they
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
that's
not
specifically
but
i
believe
that
follows
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
--
from
section
162-12
where
you're
permitted
to
deduct
the
expense.
if
you
deduct
the
expense
you
would
have
a
zero
basis.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
that
is
the
government's
position
and
i
believe
the
respondents
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
my
view
is
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
that
the
statute
says
that
this
is
not
property
includible
in
an
inventory
and
the
regulation
requires
you
to
include
it
in
the
inventory.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
i
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
--
you
are
not
to
give
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
if
you're
going
to
give
effect
to
section
162-12,
he
would
be
permitted
to
deduct
the
expenses.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
not
as
we
look
at
it
your
honor.
we
still
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
the
question
--
as
far
as
we're
concerned
is
the
statute
says
this
property
is
not
includable
on
the
inventory.
and
the
regulation
requires
us
to
include
it
in
the
inventory.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
and
that's
the
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
then
we're
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
then
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
if
it
was
removed
from
the
inventory
it
would
have
a
zero
basis.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
that
--
i
don't
see
how
it
can
do
that
at
this
point.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
you're
entitled
to
deduct
the
cost
of
operating
them.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
that
--
well,
it
goes
back
to
--
we're
dealing
with
the
statute
here
which
is
similar.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
it's
similar
to
these
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
--
situation
where
the
statute
and
the
regulations
who
granted
the
oil
and
gas
operator
their
--
the
right
to
expense
these
things.
now,
from
accounting
standpoint
that's
not
proper.
but
from
an
income
tax
standpoint,
it
is
proper,
i
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
under
the
regulation
which
has
been
in
existence
for
45
years,
it
doesn't
say
that
the
cash
can
and
the
accrual
can't.
it
says
all
livestock
raisers
can.
now,
the
government
--
insofar
as
the
accrual-basis
taxpayers
are
concerned,
he
reports
his
income
as
it's
earned
and
deducts
the
expenses
as
they
are
incurred.
and
we
submit
--
it's
our
argument,
our
position
that
he
can
deduct
these
expenses
under
this
regulation.
he
is
required
to
include
--
maintain
an
inventory
and
he's
required
to
include
in
his
inventory,
the
value
of
his
livestock
which
produces
ordinary
income.
the
government
argues
that
this
doesn't
increase
the
taxpayers'
ordinary
income
and
my
answer
to
that
is
--
is
at
page
4
of
the
record,
paragraph
7,
the
stipulation.
and
it
clearly
says
there
as
a
result
of
including
these
animals
an
inventory,
it
increased
taxpayer's
ordinary
income.
a
part
of
1942
there
was
no
difference
between
cattle
held
primarily
for
sale
and
cattle
held
for
draft,
breeding
or
dairy
purposes.
and
all
the
gains
which
were
realized
from
the
sale
of
these
animals
was
treated
as
ordinary
income.
but
as
a
result
to
the
enactment
of
117
(j)
in
1942
all
that
was
changed.
and
at
the
outset,
the
benefits
of
this
action
were
either
limited
or
denied
in
full
to
the
livestock
industry.
and
even
after
the
albright
case
and
the
bennett
decision
since
1949
to
1951
was
necessary
for
congress
to
amend
section
117
(j)
making
it
specifically
applicable
to
the
livestock
industry.
now
in
the
meantime,
the
commissioner
in
1944
had
issued
this
unit-livestock-price
method
regulation.
and
through
this
process
he
commenced
--
discriminated
against
the
accrual-basis
taxpayers
by
requiring
them
to
include
their
raised
breeding
animals
in
the
inventory.
and
while
the
regulation
permitting
both
the
cash
and
the
accrual-basis
taxpayers
to
deduct
the
cost
of
expenses,
permit
--
continued
to
remain
in
effect,
this
device
of
compelling
the
raised
breeding
animals
in
the
inventory
thus
became
the
tool
by
which
that
the
commissioner
attempted
to
deny
the
benefits
of
the
section
to
these
taxpayers.
and
the
discriminatory
effect
of
the
regulation
was
first
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
courts
in
the
lewis
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
there
held
that
the
regulation
was
invalid.
the
court
there
concluded
that
under
the
1951
amendment
to
section
117
(j)
the
taxpayers
were
not
required
to
include
the
raised
breeding
animals
in
the
inventory.
and
that's
the
treasury
regulation
which
compelled
the
taxpayer
to
include
breeding
animals
in
the
inventory
contravened
the
statute
and
was
therefore
invalid.
undaunted,
the
commission
had
succeeded
in
the
ekberg
case
and
in
drafting
onto
the
lewis
case
the
doctrine
of
knowledgeable
choice.
now
under
the
theory
of
the
ekberg
case,
if
the
taxpayer
elect
to
the
accrual
basis
after
the
issuance
of
this
i.t.
in
1945,
he
was
bound
by
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
under
the
accrual
method.
the
government
here
seeks
to
employ
the
ekberg
doctrine
i
believe
against
the
respondents
catto.
the
difficulty
for
the
government
however
is
that
a
knowledgeable
choice
presupposes
a
full
knowledge
of
all
material
facts.
now
the
catto's
had
the
choice
--
their
choice
to
elect
the
cash
or
accrual
method
of
accounting
and
select
the
method
of
evaluating
the
inventory.
when
they
commenced
their
ranching
operations
in
1938,
that
time
a
rancher
could
not
get
capital
gains
on
breeding
livestock
under
any
circumstances.
thus,
the
consequences,
the
options
available
were
not
known.
therefore,
the
taxpayer
should
not
be
charged
with
accepting
a
disadvantage
which
was
non-existent
at
the
time.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
at
this
time,
your
honor?
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
up
until
recently
--
we
learned
yesterday
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
if
they
were
permitted
to,
they
would.
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
right.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
here
we
have
not
sought
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
no
sir.
here
we
have
not
sought
to
change
to
the
cash
basis
for
the
reason
that
the
government
says
that
if
we're
going
to
change
to
the
cash
basis,
we
--
the
commissioner's
consent
is
required.
and
during
these
years
involved
in
the
litigation,
it
was
stipulated
the
commissioner
wouldn't
even
consider
a
request.
so
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
--
from
a
practical
matter
we
were
in
this
box
and
we
couldn't
get
out.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
if
he
was
permitted
the
choice,
he
would.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
no
sir,
we
have
never
submitted
an
application
because
it
would
have
been
a
useless
thing
because
they
wouldn't
even
--
to
have
considered
it
for
a
period
of
approximately
10
or
15
years.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
law
did
not
become
clear
until
the
law
--
until
the
statute
was
codified
and
(inaudible)
--
and
cast
in
unequivocable
terms
in
1951.
now,
even
though
at
that
time
albright
had
been
decided
in
1949
the
commissioner
did
not
accept
this
as
the
law
as
he
continued
to
litigate
the
matter.
as
late
as
1951
in
the
bennett
case,
he
was
still
contending
that
all
livestock
were
held
primarily
for
sale
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
that
no
rancher
was
entitled
to
capital
gains
on
any
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
now,
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
and
in
the
oral
argument
raised
the
point
that
a
taxpayer
can't
revoke
an
election
merely
because
there's
been
a
change
in
the
law.
and
they
cite
this
court's
decision
in
wilshire
oil
company.
now
i
submit
that
that
case
is
distinguishable
on
several
grounds.
one,
the
statute
there
was
not
a
relief
statute.
it
was
merely
a
statute
dealing
with
the
computation
of
depletion.
two,
after
the
statute
was
passed
in
that
case
the
commissioner
by
regulation
afforded
taxpayers
a
new
option,
six
months
period
in
which
to
make
a
new
election.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
did
not
exercise
that
option.
we
in
this
case
have
never
been
afforded
an
option
to
make
any
such
election.
but
the
government
argues
here
that
the
doctrine
of
statutory
reenactment
applies.
they
go
on
to
say
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
situation,
discrimination
between
the
cash
and
accrual-basis
taxpayer.
and
in
any
event
the
--
that
they
were
prevented
from
changing
the
regulation
because
the
secretary
of
treasury
wrote
a
letter
to
the
senate
finance
committee
chairman.
since
the
code
was
reenacted,
the
provision
was
reenacted
in
the
1954
code
verbatim
that
it's
been
frozen
in
the
law.
my
first
answer
to
that
in
which
i
--
i'm
somewhat
embarrassed
to
admit,
is
not
included
in
the
brief
because
i
just
quite
overlooked
it
until
this
weekend,
is
the
letter
itself.
the
letter
is
dated
june
27,
1952
and
it
says
and
i
quote,
“my
dear
senator,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
has
called
to
my
attention
the
tax
situation
which
deserves
serious
legislative
consideration.
the
problem
is
of
such
importance
that
i
feel
it
should
promptly
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
congressional
committees
concerned
with
taxation.”
in
1952,
in
june
of
1952,
the
secretary
of
treasury
first
learned
about
the
problem
and
at
that
time
he
said
he
thought
it
ought
to
be
brought
to
the
committee's
attention.
there
are
several
other
reasons
the
doctrine
doesn't
apply.
one
is
that
there's
not
a
line
from
any
congressional
hearing,
any
committee
report,
or
any
floor
debate,
to
show
that
congress
was
ever
aware
of
the
situation
much
less
that
it
intended
to
improve
it.
finally,
the
government
argues
that
the
removal
of
these
animals
from
the
inventory
constitutes
the
change
of
accounting
method.
and
since
that
the
commissioner's
position
was
not
obtained,
the
removal
was
illegal,
and
our
cause
of
action
must
fail.
our
reply
here
is
again
two-fold.
in
the
first
place,
no
change
of
accounting
method
is
involved.
the
animals
were
erroneously
included
in
the
inventory
in
compliance
with
the
invalid
regulation
and
in
violation
of
the
statute.
therefore,
the
taxpayers
are
simply
corrected
and
they're
caused
by
an
invalid
regulation
and
in
complying
with
the
expressed
terms
of
the
statute.
hence,
no
change
of
accounting
method
is
involved
and
the
taxpayers
were
not
required
to
obtain
the
commissioner's
consent.
but
even
if
we
assume
that
it
--
the
change
of
accounting
method
is
involved,
the
commissioner's
consent
would
not
be
required
here.
as
i
pointed
out,
it
was
stipulated
in
this
case
that
the
commissioner
would
have
refused
to
consider
and
as
a
consequence
to
act
upon
an
application
during
the
years
in
question
and
this
is
precisely
the
same
situation
which
existed
during
the
years
involved
in
the
lewis
case.
now,
conceding
the
statute
gives
the
commission
the
power
to
pass
on
application
for
change
of
accounting
method,
and
conceded
also
that
the
commission
is
vested
with
the
discretion
to
refuse
these
applications,
we
submit
however
that
the
commission
is
not
vested
with
the
power
or
authority
to
arbitrarily
refuse
to
even
consider
application.
in
our
brief,
there
are
several
opinions
by
this
court
that
stand.
we
submit
that
the
proposition
that
a
public
official
vested
with
discretionary
power
must
exercise
that
discretion
and
may
not
arbitrarily
determine
the
issues
without
even
considering
the
merits.
i'm
specifically
referring
to
united
states
v.
shaughnessy,
a
decision
by
justice
clark
in
yellin
versus
united
states
was
--
the
decision
was
by
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
well,
we
think
under
this
general
proposition
of
law
that
it
is.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
that
a
taxpayer
is
not
required
to
do
a
useless
thing.
if
the
commissioner
is
refusing
to
even
consider
this
thing,
there
is
no
reason
--
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
--
for
him
to
have
it
apply.
mr.
gordon
g.
hawn
no,
other
than
the
lewis
case
itself.
now
this
point
has
been
raised
in
the
--
it
was
raised
in
the
lewis
case
and
it
was
not
answered
by
the
government.
and
this
point
was
raised
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
it
wasn't
answered
by
the
government.
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
been
raised
here
in
our
brief,
and
if
we
still
haven't
received
an
answer
by
the
government
--
why?
we
submit
that
there's
no
answer
other
than
the
commissioner
has
abused
his
discretion.
thank
you
sir.
