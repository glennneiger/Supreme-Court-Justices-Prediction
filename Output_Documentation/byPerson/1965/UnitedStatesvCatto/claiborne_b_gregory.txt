mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
court.
i
represent
the
wardlaw
taxpayers
in
this
case
and
they
are
--
they
were
joined
with
the
united
states
versus
catto
for
purposes
of
this
appeal.
i'd
like
to
know
one
little
point
before
i
get
into
my
argument.
the
government's
attorney
has
talked
about
these
various
accounting
method
but
he
knows
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
aren't
any
generous
accounting
methods
that
would
enable
any
taxpayer
not
to
pay
the
full
tax
on
every
dollar
of
income.
you
can't
--
they
don't
add
up
that
way.
this
case
began
as
a
conflict
between
two
regulations
of
the
commissioner,
regulation
162-12
and
regulation
471-6
(f).
now,
this
was
the
conflict
that
was
litigated
in
the
lewis
case,
the
ekberg
case
and
is
the
way
this
case
was
litigated
in
the
court
of
appeals
below.
and
the
conflict
was
this,
regulation
162-12,
which
was
promulgated
45
years
ago
and
is
a
very
simple
clear-cut
regulation,
stated
that
livestock
raisers
were
permitted
to
deduct
the
cost
of
raising
their
breeding
animals
as
a
current
expense.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
noted
this
in
1952,
and
he
made
a
very
clear
statement
that
since
the
early
days
of
income
tax,
livestock
raisers
have
been
permitted
to
deduct
their
raising
cost
of
their
breeding
animals
as
a
current
expense.
now,
when
he
--
when
their
decision
was
made,
no
doubt,
they
need
--
the
unique
character
of
this
situation
was
just
as
apparent
as
it
is
today.
but
the
commissioner
made
the
determination
that
those
raising
costs
of
breeding
animals
were
to
be
deducted
as
current
expenses.
that
regulation
has
stayed
unchanged
as
i
say
for
45
years.
and
the
petitioner
admits
that
by
the
process
of
statutory
reenactment,
that
regulation
has
assumed
the
force
of
law.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
at
that
time,
you
mean
up
to
the
time
--
when
that
regulation
was
first
promulgated
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
--
and
then
on
to
1944,
the
gain
on
the
sale
of
animals
they
held
for
sale
and
the
gain
on
the
sale
of
animals
held
for
breeding
purposes
was
treated
just
alike.
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
do
you
have
the
animal
in
inventory
or
not.
it
didn't
make
any
difference
about
your
accounting
method
or
anything
else.
it
was
ordinary
income.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
yes
sir.
now,
in
1944,
the
regulation
was
promulgated
with
which
this
regulation
i'm
just
talking
about,
conflicts.
in
1944,
regulation
471
was
promulgated
and
the
commissioner
interpreted
that
regulation
as
saying
that
the
cost
of
raising
breeding
animals
should
be
capitalized.
and
that
was
exactly
contrary
to
what
is
existing
regulation
said.
and
in
the
court
below,
he
stated
that
regulation
4471
said
that
breeding
animals
must
be
included
in
the
inventory
if
a
livestock
farmer
selected
the
unit
livestock
price
benefit
of
valuing
his
other
animals.
well,
by
putting
them
in
inventory,
he
has
admitted
and
it
follows
naturally
that
he
is
capitalizing
the
cost
of
raising
those
breeding
animals.
that's
what
he
said
in
the
court
below.
now,
in
his
brief
in
this
court,
his
opening
brief,
he
changed
his
mind
and
said,
“that's
not
so,
you
don't
have
to
put
your
raised
breeding
animals
in
inventory,
471
doesn't
require
that.
no
other
regulation
requires
that.”
but
471
does
require,
that
if
you
use
--
elect
the
unit-livestock
price
method
of
valuing
your
animals,
then
you've
got
to
capitalize
the
raise
and
cost
of
all
your
breeding
animals,
whether
they're
in
inventory
or
not.
that
was
his
position
in
his
opening
brief.
yesterday,
late
afternoon,
i
was
served
a
copy
of
his
reply
brief
and
i
found
that
he
has
changed
his
position
very
materially
again.
this
change
is
that
he
no
longer
rests
his
case
on
regulation
471.
he
no
longer
confines
his
contention
to
livestock
farmers
who
have
selected
the
unit-livestock
price
method
of
valuing
their
inventory.
he
says
now,
that
all
livestock
farmers
must
capitalize
the
cost
of
raising
their
breeding
animals,
all
of
them.
and
he
doesn't
care
whether
they
fall
under
471
by
election
or
voluntary
election
and
anything
else.
he
doesn't
care
what
that
method
of
valuation
is
whether
it's
that
method
or
the
farm-price
method,
he
doesn't
care
whether
they're
on
the
accounting
method
or
the
cost
method
and
he
doesn't
care
whether
animals
had
put
in
inventory
or
not.
now,
i
regard
this
as
a
major
change
in
his
position
which
as
i'll
point
out
in
a
minute,
we
don't
worry
about
it.
but
i
want
to
note
the
fact
that
up
until
now,
up
until
this
reply
brief,
the
government
has
premised
its
claim
on
the
proposition
that
section
471
is
the
section
they're
talking
about
and
that
we
are
under
section
471
because
we
elected
the
unit
livestock
price,
about
the
value
of
inventories.
and
because
we
are
under
there,
first,
we
must
put
our
animals,
our
breeders
into
inventory
and
that
means
we've
got
to
capitalize
our
raising
cost
or
judging
by
his
opening
brief,
he
said
you
don't
have
to
put
a
meaning
but
he
says
the
same
thing.
he
says,
you've
got
capitalize
the
raising
--
the
raising
costs
of
your
breeders.
so,
he
has
moved
out
away
completely
from
section
471,
he
is
no
longer
confining
himself
to
farmers
who
elected
the
unit-livestock
price
method.
that
was
the
situation
in
the
lewis
case
that
was
the
situation
in
the
ekberg
case.
now,
he's
taking
it
across
the
board
position,
that
all
livestock
farmers,
without
the
qualification
or
limitation.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
he
says,
all
livestock
farmers
without
qualification
or
limitation,
cash
basis,
accrual
basis
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
well,
that's
what
he
--
that's
what
he
says
and
here's
the
way
he
put
it
sir
--
justice
white.
he
said,
“all
of
you
are
supposed
to
capitalize
your
raising
costs
of
beef
breeding
animals.”
but
--
and
i
quote
his
words,
“but
we
have
found
that
the
--
many
ranchers
and
farmers
are
not
capable
of
valuing
cattle
on
hand
and
deferring
cost
properly
allocable
to
them,
so
we
don't
bother
to
ask
them
to
capitalize
their
cost.”
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
that's
the
reason.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
i'm
quoting
from
the
reply
brief,
i
read
it
last
night.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
what's
that?
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
that's
right,
justice
fortas.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
at
the
bottom
of
page
2,
last
line,
top
of
page
3.
they
say
--
perhaps
they
have
the
long
reply
brief.
we
don't
particularly
object
to
this
constant
shifting
of
position
by
the
petitioner.
while
we
want
opportunity
if
the
court
will
permit
us
to
reply
--
to
answer
to
the
reply
brief,
we
don't
object
to
it
because
we
feel
and
we
recognize
that
it
means
that
he
is
shifting
away
from
some
position
when
he
finds
it
not
tenable
and
moving
to
another
position
which
he
hopes
would
be
more
tenable.
this
last
shift,
however,
has
in
my
opinion
brought
into
a
bad
position
because
he
is
now
confronting
absolutely
without
them
--
any
limitation,
without
any
reliance
on
section
--
regulation
471,
he
is
confronting
and
repudiating
the
regulation
162-12
that
he
himself
says,
has
assumed
the
statute
of
the
--
attain
the
status
of
law
by
constant
reaffirmation
by
the
congress.
and
he
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
i
don't
know,
i
listened
very
carefully
and
i
think
they're
trying
to
embrace
all
the
positions.
and
that's
why
i'm
going
to
try
to
answer
all
positions.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
yes
sir.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
it
seems
to
me
that
having
gone
as
far
as
he
has
and
having
said
that
we
now
will
require
the
capitalization
of
this
raising
costs
in
all
cases,
that
the
government
has
gone
so
far
and
reviews
his
case
really
down
to
a
question
of,
“can
he
do
this
in
the
face
of
this
regulation,
of
45
years
standing
which
he
admits
has
attained
the
status
of
law,
or
can't
he?”
now,
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
left,
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
on
how
this
problem
came
up
and
exactly
what
it's
all
about
as
i
see
it.
up
until
1944,
there
was
no
problem
as
i
pointed
out
a
few
minutes
ago,
no
attempt
to
make
you
capitalize
the
cost
of
raising
the
animals.
but
in
1942,
when
congress
decided
to
give
capital
gains
treatment
to
the
sale
of
breeding
animals,
the
commissioner
concluded
that
there
was
something
unfair,
something
wrong,
with
this
business
of
deducting
the
cost
of
raising
the
breeding
animal,
and
then
when
you
sell
it
later
on,
get
capital
gain.
that's
what
he's
quarreling
with,
he's
quarreling
with
the
culmination
of
his
own
regulation
of
45
years
standing
and
its
interaction
with
the
will
of
congress.
in
1942,
they
granted
the
capital
gains
treatment.
now,
the
--
his
thinking
that
lead
him
to
this
conclusion,
i
don't
know.
but
--
and
it
may
have
been
some
of
this
somewhat
metaphysical
reasoning
about
--
well
when
you
maintain
and
shelter
and
feed
that
animal
there
that's
just
been
born,
somehow
you're
acquiring
something.
you
know
he's
not
growing
by
nature,
you're
doing
it.
and
therefore,
you
should
deduct
this
raising
cost.
of
course,
the
bad
thing
about
that
from
his
standpoint
is
that
the
commissioner
has
saved
this
for
45
years
that
you
do
deduct
it.
he
recognizes
it
this
--
this
is
a
unique
situation.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
paying
out
of
money
to
get
some
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
they
do.
they
contemplate
that
you
go
out
and
acquire
something
or
to
buy
something
or
buy
something
to
bill
something,
generally,
not
addressed
to
anything
of
an
inanimate
things.
of
course,
this
same
situation
has
risen
in
connection
with
raise
--
with
fruit
trees,
no
problem.
the
government
doesn't
seem
to
make
issue
out
of
them
but
it's
the
exact
same
problem.
and
they
permit
the
cost
of
raising
the
fruit
trees,
watering
them,
fertilize
them,
taking
care
of
them,
that's
their
current
expense,
then
when
you
sell
them,
capital
gain.
exactly
the
same,
exactly
the
same
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
yes,
but
that's
too
late.
by
then,
he's
put
the
value,
the
full
value
that
animal
in
the
inventory
and
taxed
it
to
his
ordinary
income.
it's
all
done.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
he's
accumulated
basis
but
he's
taxed
it
to
you
as
ordinary
income.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
no.
you
are
permitted
to
deduct
the
cost
of
raising
animals,
that
is
immediately
taken
the
words
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
--
that
by
increasing
the
value
of
animal
and
so
is
tax
to
you
is
ordinary
income.
if
it
weren't
built
up
like
that,
you're
raising
cost
would
constitute
a
deduction
in
--
against
other
ordinary
income.
but
if
not,
well
he
does
it,
you
never
get
a
nickel
of
other
than
ordinary
income
treatment
in
the
average
case
of
raising
a
breeding
goat
or
a
breeding
sheep.
you
don't,
because
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
you
don't.
you,
of
course,
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
no.
i
don't
think
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
it.
and
you
can't,
not
under
the
law.
that's
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
because
it's
a
current
form
of
expense,
just
like
the
commissioner
decided
years
ago
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
well,
i
just
don't
think
it's
an
acquisition
cost.
did
you
acquire
that
animal
raised
on
your
farm?
do
you
acquire
him
each
year?
you
acquired
him
when
he
is
born.
you
sustained
him
after
he
was
born.
for
sustaining
animals,
you
get
a
deduction.
nature
says
he
grows
because
he
is
young.
but
that
doesn't
make
it
an
acquisition,
you're
not
acquiring
that
animal
every
year,
you
acquire
him
once
when
he
is
born.
you
sustain
him
or
maintain
him
thereafter.
just
as
a
man
in
a
manufacturing
business,
sustains
and
maintains
a
big
machine
over
here.
he
orders,
and
services,
and
keeps
it
good
shape.
it
doesn't
have
within
it
(inaudible)
of
growth,
true,
and
that's
the
only
difference.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
yes.
if
you
buy
an
immature
animal
but
you
won't
put
in
your
breeding
herd,
i
think
just
like
i've
said,
i
think
you
should
not
be
denied
the
right
to
deduct
the
current
expense,
what
you
have
put
out
to
sustain
that
animal.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
no.
no,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
no,
that's
not
involved.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
that's
right.
i
have
only
a
moment
or
two
left
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
--
this
concept
that
the
government
through
that
act
and
through
the
commissioner,
adopted
in
1921,
that
could
deduct
raising
costs
and
the
government
now
wishes
to
say
that
as
to
cash-method
farmers,
you
can
--
you
have
to
cap
--
you
don't
have
to
capitalize,
and
as
to
accrual-method
farmers,
you
do
have
to
capitalize.
the
government
has
offered
only
one
explanation
of
why
this
regulation
162
has
been
applied
to
deny
this
right
to
the
accrual-method
farmer
and
grant
it
to
the
cash-method
farmer.
and
here's
explanation
has
been
that
we
--
the
commissioner
has
denied
this
because
he
has
given
the
word
may
in
the
regulation
which
says
you
may
deduct
these
expenses
and
administratively
circumscribed
compass.
and
that
is
about
all
he
said
by
way
of
justification,
that's
all
it
said
until
his
reply
brief.
and
it
is
submitted
in
the
words
to
this
court
in
the
recent
case
that
these
--
that
this
administratively
circumscribed
compass
is
hardly
a
persuasive
response
to
the
question
of
why
the
commissioner
gives
one
practice
to
the
cash
farmer
and
another
practice
to
the
accrual-method
farmer.
now,
in
his
reply
brief,
the
government
apparently
has
gotten
away
from
this
because
he
does
make
this
any
longer,
he
says
under
162,
everybody
capitalizes
except
the
accrue
--
the
cash-method
farmer
and
we
can't
think
of
any
way
to
figure
out
where
his
cost
are,
so
he
doesn't
have
to
capitalize.
that
has
never
been
a
difficulty
in
the
tax
law
before
in
determining
values
and
determining
other
difficult
questions.
they
were
determined,
and
was
done.
but
here,
for
some
reason,
he
seizes
on
the
accrual-method
farmer
and
says
he
must
capitalize
and
the
cash-method
farmer
doesn't
have
to.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
in
behalf
of
the
respondents
i
would
first
i
would
like
to
ask
permission
of
the
court
to
file
an
answer
to
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner
in
as
much
as
we
received
it
only
a
matter
of
hours
before
this
hearing
began.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
we
would
like

your
honor

--
the
reason
we'd
like
to
is
we

there
was
a
change
of
position
which

two
days.
mr.
claiborne
b.
gregory
thank
you
sir.
in
the
three
minutes
i
have
left,
i
would
like
to
make
two
brief
points
prompted
by
a
question
asked
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
first
point,
in
1952
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
stated
that
the
way
the
commissioner
was
administering
regulation
162-12
by
requiring
an
accrual
method
farmer
to
capitalize
the
cost
of
raising
his
breeding
animals
and
permitting
a
cash
method
farmer
to
expense
the
same
item
“discriminated
heavily”
against
the
accrual
method
farmer.
the
petitioner
is
now
as
in
this
court
to
sanction
and
approve
that
discrimination.
and
to
strike
from
the
books
a
45-year
old
regulation
which
states
categorically
that
raising
costs
of
breeding
animals
constitutes
an
expense
and
therefore
cannot
be
capitalized.
my
second
point,
the
petitioner
argues
that
by
electing
the
accrual
method
of
accounting,
a
farmer
binds
himself
to
capitalize
the
cost
of
raising
his
breeding
animals.
this
is
simply
not
true.
it
is
fundamental
in
tax
law
and
tax
accounting
that
a
person
does
not
by
adopting
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
or
any
other
method
elect
or
agree
to
capitalize
any
item
of
his
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses
such
as
the
cost
of
raising
his
breeding
animals.
it
is
only
when
he
decides
to
put
his
breeders
into
inventory
that
the
mechanics
of
the
inventory
method
of
accounting
picks
up
these
expenses
and
capitalizes
them.
it
is
true
that
the
farmers
in
the
wardlaw
case
did
elect
to
put
their
breeders
in
inventory.
but
they
did
so
years
ago,
some
as
far
back
as
1913
long
before
such
inclusion
had
any
significance
tax
wise.
and
when
it
did
become
significant
tax
wise,
the
commissioner
ruled
under
regulation
471
that
they
could
not
take
their
breeders
out.
when
the
lewis
case
came
along
it
overruled
the
commissioner.
the
respondents
in
the
wardlaw
case
promptly
filed
a
claim
for
refund.
i
thank
the
court.
