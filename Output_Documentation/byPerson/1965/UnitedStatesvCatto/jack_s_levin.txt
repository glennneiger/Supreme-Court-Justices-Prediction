mr.
jack
s.
levin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
income
tax
case.
it
presents
the
question
whether
cattle
ranchers
and
others
who
are
in
the
business
of
raising
livestock
can
deduct
as
incurred
the
costs
of
raising
their
livestock
which
they
used
for
breeding
purposes
or
whether
they
can
be
required
by
the
commissioner
to
defer
the
deduction
of
such
expenses
until
the
livestock,
the
breeding
livestock,
are
sold,
and
deduct
the
expenses
against
the
proceeds
of
sale
in
computing
gain.
the
respondents
argued
that
they
should
be
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
their
costs
of
raising
breeding
livestock
as
these
expenses
are
incurred.
despite
the
requirement
in
the
treasury
regulations
that
they
defer
such
costs
and
deduct
them
from
the
proceeds
derived
from
selling
such
animals
in
computing
gain.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
your
honor,
if
we
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
it
is
i
would
say,
just
about
the
same
concept.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
the
same
sections
require
it.
there
are
two
questions
with
regard
to
a
deduction,
to
an
expense
which
you
incur.
the
first
question
is
the
time
of
the
deduction.
that
is
when
you
will
deduct
what
you
have
deducted
at
the
time
you
incur
it
or
whether
you
will
postpone
it
until
you
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
disposed
of
an
asset
and
deducted
that.
the
second
question
is
the
type
of
income
against
which
that
expenditure
will
be
offset.
that
is
whether
ordinary
income
or
capital
gain.
and
these
are
the
two
question
which
we
must
answer
in
this
case,
which
regard
to
the
costs
of
raising
breeding
livestock,
stated
as
your
honor
has
stated
it,
whether
they
get
a
deduction
as
they
expend
their
money
for
raising
their
livestock,
their
breeding
livestock,
or
whether
they
must
add
the
expenses
to
the
basis
of
the
livestock
and
then
deduct
them
from
the
sales
proceeds
in
computing
gain
from
the
sale
of
that
livestock.
this
is
livestock,
which
typically
they
raised
from
birth.
and
if
they
deducted
all
of
the
expenses
of
raising
them
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
when
they
sold
them,
they
would
have
a
zero
basis.
that's
right.
there
are
nine
cases
consolidated
here.
respondents
and
all
of
them
raised
livestock,
mostly
cattle
but
including
some
sheep
and
goats,
and
they
hold
these
livestock
for
sale.
as
an
incident
to
their
business
of
raising
livestock
for
sale,
they
also
raise
breeding
cattle,
breeding
livestock,
which
they
used
to
produce
their
beef
animals.
a
rancher's
income
derived
from
selling
beef
animals
is
ordinary
income.
it's
like
the
cost
--
it's
like
the
income
from
selling
shoes
to
a
manufacturer
of
shoes.
a
--
the
rancher's
income
from
selling
his
breeding
cattle
is
capital
gain,
like
the
shoe
manufacturer's
income
from
selling
his
shoe
machinery
because
the
breeding
cattle
are
used
in
his
trade
or
business
to
produce
his
inventory,
that
is
his
beef
animals.
all
of
the
respondents
have
elected
the
accrual
method
of
accounting.
and
during
the
years
here
in
question,
they
complied
with
the
treasury
regulations,
which
required
them
to
defer
the
costs
of
raising
both
their
beef
animals
and
their
breeding
animals.
they
deferred
these
costs
and
with
regard
to
the
animals
sold
and
the
years
here
in
question,
they
deducted
those
deferred
costs
in
computing
their
gain,
which
in
the
case
of
beef
animals
was
ordinary
income
and
the
case
of
breeding
animals,
was
capital
gain.
thereafter,
the
respondents
filed
claims
for
refund
in
which
they
argued
that
the
treasury
regulations
were
invalid.
and
that
they
were
really
entitled
to
deduct
the
costs
of
raising
their
breeding
cattle
as
incurred.
they
said
that
they
were
content
to
continue
to
defer
the
cost
of
raising
their
beef
cattle,
but
that
they
wanted
to
deduct
the
costs
of
raising
breeding
cattle
as
incurred.
thus,
having
a
zero
basis
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
so
that
when
they
sold
their
breeding
cattle,
they
would
have
capital
gain
to
the
extent
of
100%
of
the
sales
proceeds,
whereas
when
they
sold
their
beef
cattle
they
were
perfectly
content
to
report
only
the
gain,
that
is
the
excess
of
the
sales
proceeds
over
the
accumulated
costs
of
raising
as
ordinary
income
gain.
although
two
circuits
have
rejected
this
argument
that
the
regulations
were
invalid,
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
reluctantly
held
the
regulations
invalid.
it
did
so
in
two
per
curiam
opinions,
in
which
it
stated
that
it
felt
bound
by
its
previous
opinion
in
scofield
versus
lewis.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“while
we
are
fully
cognizant
of
the
anomaly
of
allowing
such
tax
treatment
of
the
capital
asset
and
appreciate
the
appealing
conceptual
arguments
of
the
government,
we
regard
scofield
is
controlling
until
its
legislative
or
judicial
demise.”
with
regard
to
every
business
expenditure,
as
i've
said
before,
there
are
these
two
questions,
that
is
the
timing
of
the
deduction
and
the
type
of
income
against
which
is
to
be
offset.
normally,
all
taxpayers
--this
is
not
referring
here
the
necessarily
ranchers
or
farmers
--
but
all
taxpayers,
are
required
to
accumulate
rather
than
to
deduct
immediately
the
cost
of
producing
assets.
and
that
is
true
whether
those
assets
are
inventory
or
a
capital
gain.
then
they
offset
the
--
these
costs
against
the
proceeds
derived
from
the
sale
of
the
assets.
if
their
assets
were
inventory,
they
get
--
their
net
income
produced
by
offsetting
the
accumulated
cost
of
producing
the
asset
against
these
sales
proceeds,
are
ordinary
income.
if
that
asset
happens
to
be
a
capital
asset,
such
as
a
machine
used
to
produce
inventory,
they
have
capital
gain.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
a
capital
asset.
it's
a
1231
asset
at
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
that's
in
the
nature
of
a
capital
asset.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
if
the
taxpayer
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i'd
like
--
i'll
take
both
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
five-year-old
cow
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
once
--
once
the
breeding
animal
reaches
maturity,
all
of
the
costs
of
maintaining
it
as
a
working
serviceable
asset,
are
immediately
deductible.
those
are
not
in
question
here,
just
as
the
cost
of
running
the
truck,
are
deductible.
that
is
minor
repairs
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
new
set
of
tires
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
what
is
in
issue
here
is
the
cost
of
raising
the
breeder
from
birth
to
the
time
it
reaches
maturity.
just
as
if
the
man
in
the
business
of
hauling
goods
for
hire
(voice
overlap)
fills
himself
a
truck.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it's
put
into
service.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
put
into
service.
the
parallel
with
the
trucking
example
would
be,
if
a
man
was
normally
in
the
business
of
running
trucks,
builds
himself
a
truck
in
his
back
room.
all
of
his
expenses
of
buying
the
wheels,
the
engine,
the
chassis,
the
body,
the
labor
which
goes
into
it,
all
of
these
expenses
would
clearly
be
capitalized.
these
respondents
concede.once
he
puts
the
truck
into
operation
and
begins
to
use
it,
then
his
expenses
are
immediately
deductible
as
the
cost
of
merely
maintaining
the
assets
in
a
sense
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
once
the
cow
reaches
maturity,
the
taxpayers,
the
respondents
may
write
off
all
of
their
expenses
of
feeding
and
caring
for
the
animal,
keeping
it
operating
so
to
speak.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
they
can
take
depreciation
so
long
as
their
basis
for
the
animal
is
in
excess
of
salvage
value,
expected
salvage
value.
however,
because
of
the
peculiarities
of
livestock
accounting,
the
taxpayers,
the
ranchers
frequently
find
themselves
with
a
basis
which
is
so
low,
merely
the
expenses
of
raising
the
animal,
that
they
are
less
than
what
the
animal
will
eventually
bring.
because
when
it's
--
when
they
finish,
whether
it
is
a
breeding
animal,
they
sell
it
as
a
beef
animal
and
they
get
the
full
--
the
full
selling
price
from
it.
there
are
some
other
technicalities
in
the
depreciation
area,
which
raised
questions,
which
are
not
now
before
this
court,
there
is
no
depreciation
question.
the
commissioner
has
frequently
denied
depreciation
deductions
if
taxpayers
include
their
breeders
in
inventory.
that
is
a
troublesome
--
somewhat
troublesome
concept,
which
i
don't
think
is
in
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
there's
no
claim
for
depreciation.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
birth
to
maturity,
when
it's
put
into
service.
now,
in
the
--
as
i've
said,
taxpayers
and
virtually
all
industries
are
required
regardless
of
the
method
of
accounting
or
regardless
of
whether
we're
talking
about
inventory
or
capitalize
assets
accumulate
deferential
sale,
the
costs
of
manufacturing
the
asset.
now,
in
the
early
1920s,
the
commissioner
recognized
that
many
small
farmers
and
ranchers
were
unable
to
perform
that
the
bookkeeping,
and
accounting,
and
allocation
tasks
necessary
to
accumulating
the
costs
--
properly
accumulating
the
cost
of
raising
crops
and
livestock.
so,
it
created
in
the
regulations
two
methods
of
livestock
accounting.
he
created
first,
a
simplified
cash
method
of
accounting
under
which
he
relaxed
the
normal
rule
of
capitalization.
the
regulations
provide
that
with
respect
to
taxpayers,
ranchers
and
farmers
who
elect
the
simplified
cash
method
of
accounting,
they
may
expense
as
incurred,
take
a
deduction
as
incurred,
for
all
of
the
cost
of
raising
their
crops
and
their
livestock.
they
need
to
accumulate
no
basis.
however,
as
the
taxpayers
who
elect
the
more
sophisticated
accrual
method
of
accounting,
and
this
method
of
accounting
was
made
available
because
it
is
a
much
more
accurate
method.
it
prevents
normally
income
from
going
up
and
down
as
a
cash
method
taxpayer
would
have
it
and
tends
to
equalize
income.
therefore,
the
big
ranchers
normally
prefer
the
more
accurate
accrual
method
of
accounting,
big
ranchers
and
farmers.
as
to
the
accrual
method
of
accounting,
he'll
--
he
continued
the
normal
rules
under
which
the
rancher
or
farmer
would
continue
to
defer
and
accumulate
until
sale
the
cost
of
raising
crops
and
livestock.
until
1942,
from
the
early
‘20s
when
these
regulations
were
adopted,
until
1942,
this
created
only
one
difference
between
the
cash
and
accrual
rancher.
that
is
a
question
of
timing,
when
he
deducted
the
cost
of
raising
his
livestock
at
the
time
incurred
or
at
the
time
the
animal
sold.
however
in
1942,
congress
enacted
section
117
(j)
of
the
code,
the
internal
revenue
code
in
1939,
it's
now
section
1231.
this
section
granted
capital
gain
treatment
for
the
first
time
to
ranchers
--
well,
it
granted
capital
gain
treatment
to,
is
to
gains
from
the
sale
of
property
used
in
the
trade
or
business.
the
commissioner
quickly
conceded
that
at
least
as
to
some
breeding
cattle,
they
were
property
used
in
the
trade
or
business
and
they
were
entitled
to
capital
gain.
the
court
shortly
overruled
the
commissioner's
distinctions
and
said,
no
all
breeding
cattle,
all
breeders
are
entitled
to
capital
grain
--
gain
treatment.
and
congress
codified
this
view
into
section
1231
in
1951.
now,
after
this
amendment
to
the
code,
the
gain
from
breeders
constituted
capital
gain.
the
gain
from
beef
animals
constituted
ordinary
income.
and
this
created
a
second
difference
between
cash
and
accrual-method
taxpayers.
cash-method
taxpayers
deducted
all
the
cost
of
raising
their
breeders
as
incurred
against
ordinary
income.
accrual-method
ranchers
deferred
the
costs
of
raising
their
breeders
and
deducted
them
at
the
time
of
sale
against
the
sales
proceeds.
in
other
words,
they
deducted
them
against
capital
gain.
to
illustrate
in
a
simple
example,
the
difference
between
these
two,
a
cash
--
in
accrual-method
taxpayer
who
raised
a
breeder
for
$100
and
then
sold
it
$150,
we
have
no
deduction
at
the
time
he
incurred
the
$100
of
costs.
that
is
over
perhaps
a
five-year
period
or
three-year
period
of
raising
the
animal
to
maturity.
at
the
time
he
sold
the
animal
for
$150,
he
would
deduct
his
$100
of
costs,
which
he'd
accumulated
as
a
cost
basis,
against
the
$150
of
sales
proceeds,
and
he
would
report
it
$50
capital
gain.
the
cash-method
rancher
on
the
other
hand,
would
deduct
the
$100
of
costs
as
he
incurred,
having
a
$100
deduction
against
ordinary
income.
when
he
sold
the
breeder,
he
would
have
$150
of
capital
gain
because
he
would
have
no
basis
accumulated
to
offset
against
the
sales
proceeds.
now,
what
this
--
what
resulted
from
this
was
a
distortion
in
the
income
of
the
cash
basis
taxpayer.
the
accrual-method
rancher
was
reporting
his
income
precisely
correctly.
he
did
have
$50
capital
gain.
the
cash-method
rancher
reported
that
transaction
as
if
he'd
had
a
$25
loss.
here's
what
i
mean
by
that.
he
took
a
$100
deduction
from
his
ordinary
income
at
the
time
he
incurred
the
expenses,
he
had
a
$150
gain,
capital
gain
on
the
sale
of
the
animal.
but
capital
gain
is
taxable
at
a
maximum
rate
of
one-half
of
your
normal
ordinary
income
rate.
in
other
words,
the
maximum
rate
that
can
be
assessed
against
capital
gain
is
to
divide
your
capital
gain
by
two
and
put
half
of
it
in
ordinary
income.
so
in
other
words,
the
cash
basis
rancher
--
when
he
really
had
a
$150
capital
gain,
put
that
into
ordinary
income
as
a
$75
gain.
one-half
of
capital
gain
is
taxable
as
ordinary
income.
so,
he
had
a
$100
deduction
at
the
time
he
raised
the
animal
and
a
$75
gain
at
the
time
he
sold
it.
he
thus
had,
letting
the
two
together,
a
$25
loss
on
the
transaction.
now,
the
commissioner
shortly
recognized
that
this
was
not
the
way
in
which
a
cash
method
taxpayer
should
ideally
be
treated.
he
recognized,
however,
that
he
had
given
this
requirement
of
accumulation
or
deferral
of
cost
away
with
regard
to
the
cash
basis
taxpayer
or
rancher
in
the
first
place,
in
order
to
give
them
a
simple
method
of
accounting.
the
commissioner
was
reluctant
to
withdraw
it
and
to
immediately
begin
requiring
the
cash-method
rancher
to
accumulate,
in
other
words,
to
take
away
from
a
simple
method
of
accounting.
but
after
a
couple
of
years
of
pondering
the
situation,
a
relatively
few
years
in
which
it
was
determined
that
all
breeders
are
illegible
for
capital
gain,
the
commissioner
then
wished
to
require
cash-method
ranchers
to
accumulate
the
cost
of
raising
breeders,
recognizing
that
this
would
withdraw
some
of
the
simplicity
of
their
methods.
however,
a
careful
examination
of
the
status
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
code
at
that
time
convinced
the
commissioner
that
he
was
precluded
by
congress
from
doing
this.
for
30
years,
cash-method
ranchers
at
that
time
was
30
years,
had
been
permitted
to
deduct
as
incurred
the
cost
of
raising
breeders.
during
this
period,
the
code
had
been
reenacted
in
numerous
times.
moreover,
and
of
even
more
significant,
is
the
fact
when
congress
in
1951,
specifically
codified
in
section
1231
the
concept
that
all
breeders
are
entitled
to
capital
gain
treatment
under
this
section.
the
legislative
history
showed
that
congress
recognized
that
there
were
two
methods
of
accounting
for
breeders.
one,
the
cash
simple
method
and
the
other,
the
accrual
more
sophisticated
method.
and
that
congress
recognized
that
some
ranchers
would
compute
gain
one
way
and
other
ranchers
the
other
way
and
approved
this
method.
the
commissioner
would
have
rightly
or
wrongly
felt
himself
bound
by
this
legislative
history
and
the
statutory
reenactment
over
30
years.
he
felt
that
he
could
not
administratively
withdraw
from
the
cash-method
taxpayers
the
right
to
deduct
their
expenses
as
incurred.
therefore,
he
went
to
congress.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
1952
wrote
a
letter
to
congress,
requesting
legislation
which
would
require
cash-method
ranchers
to
accumulate
the
cost
of
raising
breeders.
at
approximately
the
same
time,
representatives
of
the
livestock
industry
went
to
congress
and
a
bill
was
introduced,
authorizing
accrual-method
ranchers
to
write
off
their
costs
as
incurred.
in
other
words,
just
exactly
what
the
respondents
are
here
requesting.congress
took
no
action
on
either
one
of
these
proposals.
instead,
in
1954,
two
years
later,
congress
reenacted
the
relevant
code
provisions
verbatim
in
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
thus,
we
have
continued
through
to
today
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
a
bill
was
introduced,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
suggest
your
honor
that
--
i
don't
have
any
specific
evidence.
however,
i
think
that
it
was
introduced
by
representatives
or
congressmen
who
were
representing
those
areas.
i
don't
have
their
names
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
i
do
know
that.
that
much,
i
do
know.
that
the
treasury's
proposal
was
to
make
cash
basis
ranchers
accumulate
as
to
accrual
basis
ranchers.
whereas,
industry
and
in
--
in
numerous
meetings,
i
think
the
treasury
was
advocating
that
accrual-method
ranchers
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
so
far
as
i
know,
there
were
no
hearings
on
the
bills.
no,
i
have
no
evidence
that
there
were
hearings
on
the
bills.
so
that
the
situation
as
it
existed
until
the
last
several
years,
is
that
ranchers
and
farmers
who
had
elected
the
simplified
cash
method
of
accounting,
deducted
their
cost
of
raising
both
breeders
and
beef
animals
as
incurred
and
reported
the
entire
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
beef
animals
as
ordinary
income,
the
entire
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
breeders
as
capital
gain.
ranchers
who
had
elected
the
more
sophisticated
and
accurate
accrual
method
of
accounting,
accumulated
those
expenses
with
regard
to
both
--
both
beef
animals
and
breeders
and
report
that
the
gain
achieved
by
deducting
the
accumulated
cost
from
the
sales
proceeds
as
ordinary
income
in
this
case
of
beef
animals
and
capital
gain
in
the
case
of
breeders.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
some
do.
i
have
no
specific
figures.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
some
still
do.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
one
reason
to
do
it
is
that
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
still
has
certain
advantages,
it
has
certain
disadvantages
but
it
has
certain
advantages.
in
cases
of
draught,
large
forced
sales
and
other
such
circumstance,
a
cash-method
rancher
would
have
a
great
bunching
of
his
income
in
one
year,
which
might
push
him
up
into
the
70%
bracket.
whereas
the
accrual-method
rancher
who
might
be
able
to
spread
out
his
income
by
accurately
reflecting
his
gains,
would
maintain
a
more
constant
income
which
would
keep
him
perhaps
in
the
30%
or
40%
bracket,
whatever
it
is.
and
that
is
worth
a
good
deal
of
money
to
spread
your
income
so
as
to
remain
in
a
40%
bracket
instead
of
having
a
bunch,
so
that
one
year
you're
in
a
20%
bracket,
the
next
year,
you're
in
the
70%
bracket.
the
respondents
are
perfectly
content
to
remain
in
the
accrual
method
of
accounting,
they
do
not
request
permission
to
change
to
the
cap
measured
--
method
of
accounting.
they're
perfectly
content
to
re
--
continue
accumulating
the
cost
of
their
beef
animals,
in
fact
they
wished
to
do
so.
they
do
not
wish
to
switch.
they
wished
to
deviate
from
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
only
with
regard
to
their
beef
animals
or
with
regard
to
their
breeding
animals.
and
in
--
with
regard
to
the
breeding
animals,
they
wished
to
use
the
same
procedures
which
have
always
been
allowed
to
cash
basis
taxpayers.
this
court
has
many
times
rejected
attempts
by
taxpayers
to
combine
the
advantages
of
more
than
one
method
of
accounting
and
avoid
the
disadvantages
of
each.
and
stated
many
times,
the
taxpayers
who
select
the
method
of
accounting
must
used
the
--
take
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
method.
and
here,
as
i
pointed
out
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
each
method
has
some
advantages
and
some
disadvantages,
in
the
simplified
method
and
the
more
sophisticated
method.
respondents
made
three
specific
tax
on
the
regulations.
first
they
say,
that
section
1231
of
the
code
itself,
forbids
the
commissioner
from
requiring
them
to
accumulate
the
cost
of
raising
breeders.
they
argued
that
section
1231
was
intended
to
give
ranchers
capital
gain
treatment
on
the
full
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
breeding
animals.
we
submit
that
the
clear
language
of
that
section
shows
that
it
grants
preferential
capital
gain
treatment
only
to
the
“gains”
recognized
from
the
sale
of
breeding
livestock.
the
word
‘gain'
is
defined
in
the
--
elsewhere
in
the
code,
as
the
excess
of
the
sales
proceeds
over
the
accumulated
or
other
cost
basis
of
the
animal
--
or
of
the
asset
sold.
the
full
sales
proceeds
would
thus
constitute
the
gain,
that
is
the
capital
gain,
only
if
the
ranchers
were
right,
respondents
were
right,
that
they
didn't
have
to
accumulate
the
costs
of
raising
the
animal.
thus,
their
argument
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
section
1231,
leads
into
the
question
of
what
do
the
regulations
require
and
what
did
congress
understand
the
regulations
to
require
when
it
enacted
1231.
their
next
argument
is
that
even
that
if
it
would
be
consistent
with
1231
to
require
them
to
accumulate
the
basis
of
breeding
animals,
the
regulations
do
not
in
effect
--
do
not
in
fact
require
them
to
do
this.
they
concede
that
with
respect
to
most
industries,
that
general
principles
of
the
code
enunciated
in
sections
263,
471
and
certain
other
sections
cited
specially
in
our
reply
brief,
require
taxpayers
to
accumulate
the
costs
of
manufacturing
creating
or
constructing
assets,
and
that
this
applies
to
both
inventory
assets
and
capital
assets.
they
concede
that
this
principle
applies
to
require
them
to
accumulate
the
cost
of
raising
their
beef
animals.
however,
they
say,
the
commissioner
has
relaxed
this
requirement
with
regard
to
their
breeding
animals.
as
i
explained
earlier,
it
is
our
position
the
commissioner
relaxed
this
requirement
only
with
regard
to
the
cash
method
taxpayer
where
it
makes
sense
to
relax
the
requirement
in
order,
solely
in
order,
to
give
the
cash-method
rancher
and
farmer
a
simplified
method
of
accounting.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
my
last
point
is
this.
we
recognize
that
the
regulation
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
do
you
mean
the
conflict
with
section
1231
of
the
code?
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
with
regard
to
section
1231
of
the
code,
it
is
their
position
that
the
regulations
wholly
aside,
code
section
1231
was
intended
to
and
thus
give
them
capital
gain
treatment
on
the
entire
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
a
breeding
animal,
that
the
force
of
the
code
is
to
prevent
the
commissioner
from
enacting
any
regulations
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
don't
think
they're
arguing
that
there's
any
constitutional
infirmity
in
that.
this
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
what
they
are
arguing,
i
think,
is
that
their
first
argument
was
that
section
1231
of
the
code
was
intended
to
forbid
the
commissioner
from
doing
this.
their
second
argument
is
that
when
they
turn
to
the
regulations,
they
said
the
regulations
have
relaxed
the
usual
requirement
that
you
must
capitalize
the
cost
of
creating
an
asset,
not
only
with
respect
to
cash-method
ranchers
but
also
with
respect
to
accrual-method
ranchers
with
respect
to
their
breeding
animals.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
the
argument
with
which
i'm
dealing
now
is
the
former.
that
is
they
properly
read
the
regulation
support
the
respondents
rather
than
the
commissioner.
and
in
--
i
would
like
now
to
turn
directly
to
that
question
and
deal
with
the
language
of
the
regulations,
which
is
not
easy.
it's
complex
language
and
it's
set
out
in
a
number
of
different
sections
which
interlocked.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
state
just
one
or
two
points
with
regard
to
ranch
and
farmer
accounting
before
i
get
to
that.
i'll
try
to
make
it
very
short.
in
ranching
and
farming,
it
is
particularly
difficult
to
ascertain
which
expenses
have
been
incurred
with
regard
to
which
assets.
in
other
words,
the
farm
hands
or
ranch
hands,
may
as
a
group,
at
one
time
work
on
growing
crops,
on
the
corn
crop.
but
another
time,
they
may
work
on
--
they
may
spend
their
time
caring
for
the
breeding
animals,
at
another
time
they
may
spend
their
time
caring
for
the
beef
animals.
if
and
--
if
an
accrual
rancher
was
to
apply
an
exact
method
of
accounting,
he
would
have
to
keep
records
to
show
what
percentage
of
each
man's
time
was
spent
on
what
type
of
animal,
he
would
have
to
break
down
the
salary
and
allocate
it,
so
on
with
all
the
other
expenses.
the
commissioner
recognized,
as
do
respondents,
that
ranch
and
farm
operators
are
particularly
unsuited
to
keeping
this
type
of
detailed
records.
therefore,
early
back
in
the
1920's,
there
grew
up
to
practice,
not
then
recognized
in
the
regulations
but
subsequently
specifically
adopted
by
the
regulations,
which
permitted
accrual
farmers
and
ranchers
to
use
an
estimated
method
of
accounting
it,
estimated
cost
method
of
accounting.
under
this
estimated
method,
a
livestock
raiser
would
estimate
the
amount
it
costs
him
to
raise
a
cow
or
a
steer
from
birth
to
one
year
old,
from
one
year
old
to
two-year
old,
to
three
years
old,
etcetera.
he
would
then
value
his
inventory
according
to
those
estimates.
in
other
words,
if
he
estimated
that
it
costs
him
$10,
in
salaries,
feed,
medical
care,
etcetera,
to
raise
a
cow
from
birth
to
one
year
old.
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
year,
he
had
on
hand
ten
one-year
old
cows,
he
would
value
those
at
$100.
that
was
an
estimated
method
of
accounting.
then
he
would
use
--
this
is
called
the
unit-livestock
price
method
of
accounting,
now
that
has
been
adopted
specifically
by
the
regulations
and
authorized
by
the
regulations,
and
all
of
the
respondents
are
on
this
estimated
cost
method
of
accounting
as
our
most
livestock
raisers.
now,
this
estimated
cost
method
of
accounting,
requires
a
two-step
procedure
in
order
to
use
it
on
an
income
tax
return.
first,
the
rancher
takes
a
deduction
for
all
of
this
expenses,
he
deducts
the
cost
of
labor,
he
deducts
the
cost
feed,
he
deducts
all
of
his
expenses.
he
then
adds
to
his
income
which
in
effect
reduces
the
amount
of
the
deduction.
he
adds
to
the
income
the
amount
which
his
estimated
raising
costs
are,
with
regard
to
the
livestock
still
on
hand.
in
other
words,
if
a
taxpayer
estimates
that
it
cost
him
$10
a
year
to
raise
a
cow,
the
beginning
of
the
year
let's
assume
for
simplicity
has
nothing
on
hand,
no
cows
on
hand.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
he
has
ten
one-year-old
cows
on
hand.
so
he
estimates
that
his
inventory
at
the
end
of
the
year
cost
him
$100
to
raise
during
that
year,
ten
one-year-old
at
the
end
of
the
year
at
$10
per
year
raising
costs.
let's
assume
that
during
that
year,
he
incurred
a
$110
worth
of
expenses
for
labor,
feed,
etcetera.
he
takes
$105
deduction
on
his
income
tax
return.
he
then
adds
to
his
income
the
increase
in
the
estimated
cost
basis
of
the
animals
on
hand,
that
is
a
hundred
dollars.
and
it
nets
out
to
give
him
a
deduction
of
$5.
now,
if
all
of
these
expenses
have
been
incurred
in
relation
to
raising
these
animals,
it
would
show
that
his
estimates
were
off
a
little,
but
that
they
were
fairly
accurate.
now,
this
example
illustrates
one
very
important
point.
that
this
estimated
method
of
accounting,
which
is
a
two-step
affair,
take
a
deduction
for
all
your
expenses
then
add
to
income,
which
in
effect
reduces
the
deduction
by
the
increase
in
your
estimated
costs
of
cattle
on
hand,
this
estimated
method
does
not
create
ordinary
income.
what
it
does
is
to
offset
a
portion
of
the
deduction,
which
was
allowed
by
the
first
step.
in
other
words,
going
back
to
my
hypothetical,
the
taxpayer
instead
of
having
a
$105
deduction
has
to
put
a
$5
deduction.
adding
that
$100
back
to
income,
his
increase
in
cattle
on
hand
does
not
create
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
income.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
it's
a
mechanical
way
of
accumulating
basis.
now,
to
illustrate,
assume
that
the
cattle
i
was
talking
about,
the
ten
one-year
olds
or
something,
they're
all
beef,
they're
all
breeding
animals,
all
animals
with
regard
to
which
the
taxpayer's
entitled
to
capital
gain.
respondents
argue
that
this
little
mechanical
example
i
just
went
through
would
have
made
them
recognize
$100
worth
of
ordinary
income
in
the
year
in
which
they
raised
those
cattle.
i
submit
that
we
have
demonstrated
that
it
doesn't
require
them
to
recognize
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
earning.
it
merely
prevents
them
from
taking
$100
worth
of
deductions,
makes
them
accumulated.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
does
with
regard
to
cash
basis
taxpayer.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
their
point,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
their
points.
now,
as
is
frequently
the
case
with
regard
to
income
tax
regulations,
the
commissioner
has
put
various
provisions
which
must
be
read
together
in
different
parts
of
the
code.
back
in
the
‘20s,
when
he
first
created
these
two
methods
of
accounting,
he
put
the
regulations
under
two
headings.
one
group
of
the
regulations
are
under
deductions,
the
other
group
are
under
methods
of
computing
income.
but
read
together,
they
are
this
two-step
procedure
which
i've
just
outlined.
under
deductions,
the
regulations
says
that
the
costs
of
raising
livestock
may
be
deducted
--
may
be
treated
as
expense
deductions.
now,
read
alone,
read
literally,
that
regulation
supports
the
respondents.
it
says
that
the
cost
connected
with
raising
livestock
may
be
treated
as
an
expense
deduction.
and
they
cite
that
regulation
throughout
their
brief,
and
it's
there.
it's
there,
it's
in
160-12
of
the
regulations
today.
it's
been
there
since
the
early
‘20s.
but
when
the
commissioner
put
that
regulation
in,
he
also
put
in
a
second
regulation
which
was
intended
to
be
read
together
with
it.
and
that
regulation
is
the
one
that
requires
you
to
add
that
to
income
in
effect
for
an
accrual-method
taxpayer
offset
a
part
of
that
deduction.
that
regulation
that
respondents
tediously
ignore,
that's
we
cite
it,
especially
in
our
reply
brief,
we
set
it
forth
extensively.
now,
the
second
regulation,
which
is
found
in
section
61-4
of
the
regulations,
states
that
with
regard
to
a
cash-method
rancher,
he
doesn't
have
to
do
anything.
he
doesn't
have
to
make
any
adjustment
on
account
of
raising
costs
with
regard
to
cattle
still
on
hand,
because
he
supposed
to
have
the
simplified
method
of
accounting,
he
just
takes
the
deduction.
however,
it
goes
on
the
state,
in
part
b
of
the
reg.
61-4
that
with
regard
to
an
accrual-method
rancher,
he
must
add
that
to
income,
the
increase
in
the
estimated
costs
of
raising
the
animals,
which
are
still
on
hand.
in
other
words,
it
effectuates
that
two-step
procedure.
take
a
deduction
then
add
that
to
income,
the
estimated
costs
of
the
animal
still
on
hand.
now,
this
is
true
regardless
of
whether
the
animals
are
treated
as
--
let
me
restate
it.
this
is
true
regardless
of
whether
the
rancher
has
elected
to
include
his
breeding
animals
in
his
inventory
or
not.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
method
--
this
is
a
question
which
we
consider
purely
mechanical,
for
accounting
convenience.
back
in
‘20s,
ranchers
typically
included
breeding
animals
in
their
inventory.
it
was
just
a
convenient
way
of
keeping
a
sheet
of
paper
to
said
inventory,
beef
animals,
breeding
animals.
if
they
don't
elect
to
keep
their
breeding
animals
in
inventory,
they
must
nevertheless
prepare
a
sheet
of
paper
to
his
capital
assets
and
estimate
the
amount,
which
the
cost
of
raising
these
capital
assets
has
increased
and
add
that
back
to
income.
the
commissioner
and
the
regulations
specifically
says
that
if
a
rancher
wishes,
he
can
include
his
breeders
in
inventory
or
he
may
treat
them
as
capital
assets,
whichever
he
prefers.
in
either
event,
he's
entitled
to
capital
gain
and
it
makes
no
real
difference.
it's
primarily
a
question
of
convenience
and
mechanics.
now,
respondents
make
a
third
argument
--
the
third
and
last
argument.
is
that
even
if
accrual-method
ranchers
have
always
been
required
to
accumulate
the
cost
of
raising
their
breeding
animals,
nevertheless,
there
is
--
these
respondents
should
be
excused
from
that
requirement
because
they
had
no
“meaningful
choice”.
by
this,
they
mean,
that
at
the
time
they
chose
the
accrual
method
of
accounting,
it
was
not
yet
recognized
that
breeders
would
be
entitled
to
capital
gain.
most
of
them
made
their
choice,
and
i'll
deal
with
the
point
of
most
of
them
in
just
a
moment,
before
1942,
before
the
statute
was
amended.
in
effect,
they're
arguing
that
they
bought
a
pig
in
a
poke,
and
that
they
have
no
meaningful
choice
when
they
made
their
selection.
now,
there
are
three
answers
to
this
argument.
the
sure
answer
is
that
respondents
have
elected
the
more
accurate
accrual
method
of
accounting.
it
had
certain
advantages
and
certain
disadvantages
at
the
time
they
elected
it.
there
are
certain
advantages
and
certain
disadvantages
today.
and
they
may
not
revoke
their
election,
merely
because
it
changed
in
the
law,
alters
one
of
the
advantages
or
disadvantages,
relative
advantages
or
disadvantages
of
one
method
of
accounting
in
relationship
to
the
other.
as
this
court's
said
in
a
similar
case,
helvering
versus
wilshire
oil,
cited
and
discussed
on
pages
11
and
12
of
our
reply
brief,
“tax
statutes
and
tax
regulations
have
never
been
static.
experienced
changing
needs,
changing
philosophies,
inevitably
produce
constant
change
in
each.
one
making
an
election
between
accounting
methods
takes
the
risk
that
the
method
of
treatment
of
an
item
might
be
changed
by
congress.”
in
that
case,
this
court
refused
to
allow
the
taxpayer
to
make
a
new
election
to
give
up
this
election
between
the
two
methods
to
take
the
other
one,
merely
because
the
law
was
changed
with
regard
to
one
of
the
relative
advantages
and
disadvantages.
in
this
case,
just
as
in
wilshire
when
respondents
elected
the
accrual
method
of
accounting,
they
took
the
risk
that
the
method
of
taxing
gain
on
the
sale
of
breeding
animals
might
be
changed
by
congress.
now,
a
second
separate
and
complete
answer
to
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
if
this
were
not
so.
then
every
time
congress
amended
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
is
frequent
--
frequently
every
year,
every
two
years,
there
would
be
some
change
in
the
relative
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
various
methods
of
accounting.
for
example,
every
time
congress
lowered
or
increased
the
rate
of
taxing
ordinary
income
as
they
do
frequently,
it
would
make
a
difference
in
the
relative
advantages
of
the
cash
and
accrual
method
of
farm
accounting,
because
if
they
raised
the
rates
on
cash
--
if
they
raised
the
rates
an
ordinary
income,
it
would
make
the
cash
method
more
attractive,
vis-à-vis
the
accrual
method
of
accounting.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
don't
say
he
shouldn't
be.
i
think
congress
has
made
that
choice.
congress
has
set
out,
set
forth
in
the
statute,
section
446
(c)
a
procedure
for
changing
an
election.
wherever
there's
an
election,
allowed
by
the
code,
and
it's
not
otherwise
stated
in
the
statute,
congress
has
said
that
a
taxpayer
may
change
his
method
of
accounting
if
he
obtains
the
permission
of
the
commissioner
first.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
this
case
relates
variously
through
years
‘54
through
‘58
or
so.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
yes,
no
complaint
about
it
up
until
‘54
was
the
earliest
year
of
complaint.
now,
congress
thus
has
proscribed
the
procedure.
the
commissioner
can
allow
changes
in
elections.
if
--
now,
what
are
the
standards
by
which
the
commissioner
generally
grants
changes
in
elections?
the
standard
is
typically,
before
a
taxpayer
can
obtain
a
change
in
an
election
of
a
method
of
accounting,
he
must
show
that
he
has
a
business
purpose.
he
must
show
that
there's
something
more
than
a
slight
change
in
the
relative
tax
advantages
of
various
methods.
he
must
show
that
there
is
a
business
reason
for
making
the
change.
for
example,
if
a
rancher,
who
had
an
inventory
of
cattle,
say
$30,000
came
and
say,
“i'm
on
the
accrual
method,
i
want
to
make
it
change
to
the
cash
method.”
the
commissioner
would
as
a
matter
of
course
allow
to
make
that
change
because
the
costs
of
keeping
the
records
necessary
to
the
accrual
method
are
disproportionate
regarded
the
small
amount
of
the
inventory
concerned.
but
with
other
taxpayers,
such
as
the
respondents
here,
where
they
have
inventories
of
cattle
of
quarter
million
dollars
or
so,
it
would
make
a
very,
very
substantial
change
in
the
--
difference
in
the
computation
of
income.
the
commissioner
would
like
to
see
both
cash
and
accrual
methods
ranchers
required
to
accumulate
the
cost
of
raising
breeders.
that
is,
the
commissioner
submits,
the
proper
way
to
do
it.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
yes
i
--
and
i
want
to
make
it
in
this
way,
your
honor.
a
second
answer
--
and
giving
a
second
answer
to
this
argument
that
they
had
no
meaningful
choice,
they
say
that
they
had
no
meaningful
choice
between
the
cash
and
accrual
methods
of
accounting.
now,
the
second
answer
is
that
if
they
had
no
meaningful
choice
and
if
we're
wrong
in
our
first
answer,
the
wilshire
case
is
to
be
overruled.
then,
all
these
respondents
would
be
afforded
as
a
chance
to
choose
again
between
the
cash
and
accrual
methods
of
accounting.
this,
they
do
not
want
to
do.
they
state
in
their
briefs
that
they
are
perfectly
content
to
remain
on
the
accrual
method
of
accounting.
they
affirmatively
wish
to
keep
on
accumulating
the
basis
of
beef
animals
so
as
to
even
out
their
income,
get
the
advantage
of
the
accrual
method
of
accounting.
they
don't
want
to
switch.
they've
never
asked
for
permission
to
switch
to
the
cash
method
of
accounting.
and
they
don't
--
do
not
now
asked
for
it
even
retroactively.
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
remain
on
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
as
to
their
beef
animals,
but
to
get
all
the
advantages
which
are
offered
solely
in
order
to
give
a
simplified
method
of
accounting
to
the
cash
taxpayer,
to
get
all
the
advantages
that
the
cash-method
taxpayer
that
it
has,
that
is
to
write
off
the
expenses
of
raising
breeders.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
your
honor.
our
answer
is
twofold
there.
first,
on
page
42
of
the
wardlaw
brief,
they
state
respondents
are
now
using
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
and
they
expect
to
continue
to
use
it.
they
are
not
seeking
to
switch
to
the
cash
method
of
accounting.
and
second,
we
say
that
the
commissioner
will
grant
at
this
time
now.
now,
we'll
grant
ranchers
permission
to
change
from
the
accrual
to
the
cash
method
of
accounting
if
they
demonstrate
a
business
reason
for
the
switch.
this
is
the
uniform
standard
applied
with
regard
to
virtually
all
elections,
the
revocation
and
reelection
between
methods
of
accounting
between
various
elections
of
other
--
you
must
show
business
reason
for
it.
now,
these
taxpayers
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
right
to
avoid
taxes
may
not
be
a
good
business
reason
to
switch
from
one
method
to
the
other.
the
right
to
save
taxes,
of
course,
is
just
another
aspect
of
the
right
to
avoid
taxes.
it's
a
question
of
emphasis
perhaps.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
at
the
time
congress
enacted
that
1951
statute,
recognizing
specifically
the
accrual-method
taxpayers
that
all
ranchers
were
--
would
get
capital
gain.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
recognized
that
some
ranchers
were
on
one
method,
the
accrual
method,
and
that
they
had
to
accumulate
basis.
and
that
cash
ranchers
were
on
the
other
method,
and
that
they
didn't
have
to
accumulate
basis.
at
that
time,
congress
showed
no
aversion
to
this
dichotomy.
they
recognized
i
think
the
simplified
method
of
accounting
was
granted
to
those
taxpayers
who
did
not
feel
themselves
able
to
go
through
the
accounting
mechanics
of
accumulating
basis.
and
who
did
not
want
the
more
accurate
and
sophisticated
method
of
accounting
which
would
enable
them
to
have
certain
other
advantages.
these
respondents
admit
that
they
want
to
continue
with
those
advantages.
if
there
is
to
be
a
general
amnesty,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
case
raises
the
question
because
these
taxpayers
don't
ask
for
it.
if
there
is
to
be
general
amnesty,
and
all
taxpayers
are
now
to
have
an
election
between
the
cash
and
accrual
method
of
accounting
if
they
had
no
choice
when
they
made
their
first
election,
is
for
congress
to
do
it.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
in
the
letter
he
wrote
to
congress,
it's
on
page
9
of
the
record,
set
forth
this
dichotomy.
told
congress,
we
are
not
going
to
grant
taxpayers
who
are
in
the
accrual
method
of
accounting,
permission
to
switch
to
a
cash
method
solely
because
they
want
to
avoid
or
save
whichever
way
you
phrase
a
taxes
by
the
switch.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
not
all
of
them.
that
the
vast
majority
to
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
other
method
which
is
most
use
is
called
the
farm-price
method.
it
is
less
advantageous
for
ranchers
--
for
the
taxpayer
than
the
unit-livestock
method
because
it
requires
them
to
accumulate
an
amount
of
costs
which
is
equal
to
the
market
value
of
the
proper
livestock.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
another
mechanical
way
of
accumulating
basis.
but
the
amount
of
basis
accumulated
under
the
farm-price
method
is,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
he
writes
off
his
entire
cost
of
raising
the
cow
as
he
incurs
it,
as
he
incurs
it.
there's
no
need
to
depreciate.
he
only
gets
one
deduction
for
$1
of
costs.
either
you
write
it
off
as
you
incur
it
or
you
accumulate
it
and
then
depreciate
it,
whatever
the
un-depreciated
remainder
is,
you
offset
against
the
proceeds
of
sale.
a
dollar
of
cost
produces
a
dollar
of
deduction
at
some
time
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
the
question
is
when.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
through
depreciation
or
through
a
loss
on
the
sale,
his
loss
on
the
sale
would
be
covered
by
section
1231
which
would
give
him
an
ordinary
loss,
gives
capital
gain
but
ordinary
loss.
