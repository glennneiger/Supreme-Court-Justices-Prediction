justice
abe
fortas
mr.
levin,
as
you
understand
that,
is
it
the
contention
of
respondent
that
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
regulations
to
whom
what
is
provided
with
respect
to
accrual-method
taxpayers
in
the
case
of
breeding
cattle,
and
what's
required
in
the
case
of
cash-method
taxpayers
from
the
case
of
breeding
cattle,
is
that
your
last
point?
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
the
one
you
made
just
a
moment
ago.
is
that
the
conflict
in
--
upon
which
your
respondent
relies
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
can
put
it
this
way.
i
appreciate
the
effort
that
you're
making
to
simplify
this
situation
for
us.
but
the
question
that
i
want
to
find
out
is
whether
respondent's
contention
as
you
understand
it,
is
that
the
commissioner
earn
in
providing
this
particular
method
for
cash
basis
taxpayers
with
respect
to
breeding
cattle
and
at
the
same
time,
has
deny
it
to
accrual-method
taxpayers.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
precisely
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
do
you
understand
them
to
say
that
the
regulation
properly
read
would
enable
them
to
do
this?
justice
abe
fortas
or
do
you
understand
them
to
be
arguing
that
if
the
regulation
has
to
be
read
to
deprive
accrual
method
of
taxpayers
in
this
opportunity,
then
the
regulation
is
discriminatory
or
not
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
mandate
or
what
not?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
levin,
do
you
make
a
point
of
the
failure
of
the
taxpayer
here
to
apply
for
a
permission
to
change
his
method?
justice
abe
fortas
the
respondents
say
that
they
haven't
applied
because
it
would
be
idle,
as
i
read
their
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
your
point
is
that
they
haven't
applied
because
they
don't
want
a
--
to
shift
their
accounting
method,
what
they
want
is
something
that
is
not
provided
for
in
the
procedures
of
the
regulations
and
that
is
to
use
part
of
each
method,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
referring
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
the
reply
brief?
are
you
referring
to
the
reply
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
this
four-page
document?
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
four-page
document?
justice
abe
fortas
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
that.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
special
statute
covering
the
oil
well
example?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
contention
that
there
is
a
statute
of
comparable
clarity
and
specificity
that
applies
here.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
it
doesn't
relate
to
whether
you
can
expense
the
item
amount,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
the
catto's
now
seek
to
change
to
a
cash
method?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
mean
to
say
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understood
it
--
as
i
understood
it
at
least
with
respect
to
the
wardlaw
case,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
seek
to
change
to
a
cash
method
totally.
but
the
taxpayer
wanted
to
be
treated
with
respect
to
breeding
cattle
as
if
it
were
on
the
cash
basis
for
that
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
about
your
claim?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
and
that
it
bothers
me.
but
i
also
want
to
ask
you
whether
catto
seeks
to
change
--
would
like
to
change
to
a
cash
basis
overall
for
its
entire
operations?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you've
never
asked
for
permission
to
change?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
precedent
or
what
i
take
it
is
your
position
that
you'd
--
don't
have
to
apply
with
the
commissioner
if
there's
a
reason
what
--
aside
to
--
suppose
that
the
application
would
be
denied?
justice
abe
fortas
what
proposition
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
any
specific
authority?
