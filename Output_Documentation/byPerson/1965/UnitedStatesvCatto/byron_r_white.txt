but
is
that
really
and
all-inclusive
categorization
--
what
about
a
truck
for
this
inventory
as
used
to
haul
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
you
wouldn't
insist
that
you
capitalize
all
the
expenses
are
running
the
truck
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
a
cow,
how
about
a
five-year-old
cow?
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
just
handle
it
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
five-year-old
cow
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
is
in
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
raising
it
to
where
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
first
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
the
grown
cow,
you
don't
require
in
inventory.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
get
the
depreciation
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we're
just
talking
about
bringing
the
cattle
in
this
--
from
the
time
it's
born
from
the
time
puts
in
--
they
put
to
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
evidence
that
the
livestock
industry
with
the
congress?
there
was
a
bill
introduced.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
is
that
--
what's
the
evidence
to
this
originated
with
the
livestock
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand.
i
can
imagine
they
originated
with
treasury.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
any
--
were
there
any
hearings
on
the
bills?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
anybody
who's
starting
out
on
the
livestock
business
ever
deliberately
accused
in
the
accrual
method
these
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
mechanical
way
of
accumulating
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
does
as
compared
to
the
cash
basis
taxpayers.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
their
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
that's
one
of
their
points.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
year
is
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
these
taxpayers
continue
to
use
the
election
--
the
--
this
method
in
â€˜42
run
through
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levin,
has
it
--
would
all
accrual-basis
taxpayers
use
the
unit
price
for
--
unit
cost
method?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
other
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
of
the
way
accumulating
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
technically,
this
taxpayer
who
grows
his
own
cows,
never
get
depreciation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
an
old
cow
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
an
old
cow
didn't
bring
some
price,
the
accrual-method
taxpayer
will
get
all
of
his
cutback
through
depreciation.
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll,
how
about
the
cash
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
he
said
in
his
oral
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
which
--
which
position
do
you
suppose
the
government's
taking
an
oral
argument,
in
that
--
the
position
he
took
in
its
opening
brief
or
in
his
reply
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
capital
gains
provisions
rather
contemplated
the
accumulation
of
an
--
of
a
basis
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
they
ascertain
one
of
the
--
of
cost
of
an
item.
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
--
they
apparently
agree
with
you
as
soon
as
your
cow
gets
old
enough
to
produce
a
calf.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
he's
done,
it's
accumulated
some
basis
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
that
means
is
that
you
can't
--
you
can't
deduct
a
capital
cost,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
if
you
went
out
and
bought
a
cow
--
bought
a
cow,
let's
say
an
adult
cow,
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
deduct
it
from
ordinary
income
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
--
why
should
you
be
able
to
deduct
the
cost
of
raising
--
of
raising
the
calf
to
a
cow?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
restating
your
position,
unless
you're
giving
any
reasons.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
you
bought
some
calves,
you
bought
some
calves
and
paid
some
price,
they've
paid
a
price
for
it
and
that
they
aren't
procuring
anything
and
you
go
ahead
and
do
--
you
feed
them
and
you
keep
some
of
them
as
cows.
now,
you're
saying
that
you
should
deduct
all
of
that
--
your
purchase
price
for
the
calf
and
also
the
--
the
cost
of
your
feed
and
labor
between
the
time
you
buy
a
calf
up
the
time
it
turns
into
a
cow?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
claim
the
deduction
for
the
money
you
pay
out
for
the
immature
calf?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
you
find
that
the
provision
in
the
statute
says
that
--
and
not
only
that
cattle
or
capital
assets
but
that
they
had
no
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
all
of
the
cost
of
raising
them
are
to
be
written
off.
i
don't
find
anything
like
that
in
the
code
itself,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
argument
really
is
whether
or
not
is
simply
--
this
is
simply
whether
or
not
the
cost
of
raising
a
calf
turning
into
a
cow
is
a
--
is
an
expense
instead
of
a
capital
item,
that's
all
that's
involved,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
else
was
involved
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
the
argument
is
about
whether
you've
got
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
you
--
you
wouldn't
--
if
the
commissioner
excluded
it
from
the
inventory,
at
least
the
same
result
in
some
other
--
that
he
could
reach
the
same
result
in
some
other
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
saying
that
it's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
in
the
expense
item.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
seems
to
me
what
is
in
--
included
in
the
inventory
or
not
is
sort
of
beside
the
point,
the
real
question
is
if
you
say
whether
the
commissioner
can
properly
deny
as
an
expense,
the
cost
that
this
man
has
incurred
in
raising
his
calves.
that's
the
question
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
question
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
he
said
that
they
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
said
the
regulation
was
invalid?
and
it
is
--
that
this
property
is
not
includable
in
the
inventory
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
it's
a
1231
asset?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
still
come
to
the
question
of
what
to
do
--
whether
it
has
any
basis
or
whether
all
these
items
are
expendable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
be
that
if
--
it
would
unless
the
--
unless
the
commissioner
decided
that
that
other
--
that
those
cost
were
not
deductible
as
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
trucks?
it's
the
example
we
used
the
other
day,
what
about
the
trucks?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
mean
--
exactly,
in
the
--
but
your
--
but
you
certainly
have
to
include
as
capital
item,
your
cost
of
building
the
trucks
if
you
built
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
your
labor
--
daily
labor
cost,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
construction
of
the
trucks.
it's
similar
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
the
trucks.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
understand
your
argument
but
the
question
still
remains
whether
this
--
whether
the
costs
of
feeding
calves
are
to
the
expense
--
is
to
be
expensed.
