justice

fortas
is
there
any
evidence
of
violence
after
mr.
gilbert
returned
to
the
scene?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
walker.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment,
if
you
will,
that
the
only
thing
that
happened
on
deprive
of
the
union
here
whereas
a
continuation
of
the
picketing.
is
that
sufficient
as
you
understand
the
law
to
constitute
ratification?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
point
then
is
that
if
violence
occurs
even
though
it's
not
authorized
whatever
that
may
mean
by
the
union
that
thereafter
the
union
has
disenabled
from
peaceful
picketing.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
dispute
as
to
whether
mr.
gilbert
and
the
umw
did
or
did
not
stage
peaceful
picketing
following
the
events
and
violence.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
includes
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
furnishing
of
the
food.
justice
abe
fortas
at
this
mine.
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
like
to
be
clear
mr.
walker
about
this
one
thing.
i
think
it
has
been
covered
and
i'd
like
to
be
clear
about
it.
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
connects
mr.
gilbert
personally
with
any
act
of
violence
in
the
same
which
he
personally
participated?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
mr.
walker.
those
nlrb
citations
are
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
walker,
may
i
suggest
that
you
leave
rest
of
those
citations
with
the
clerk.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
walker,
i
have
to
say,
up
at
this
point
i
ask
you
this.
as
i
understand
on
what
we
have
before
us
is
a
judgment
which
was
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
a
judgment
on
the
state
law,
the
federal
court
having
acquired
jurisdiction
as
a
result
of
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
am
i
correct
thus
far?
justice
abe
fortas
no
mr.
owens
told
us
as
i
remember
and
under
tennessee
law,
you
cannot
recover
punitive
damages
and
where
liability
results
from
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior.
justice
abe
fortas
can
the
jury
make
a
finding
of
conspiracy
here?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
your
position
is
that
this
is
taken
out
of
the
category
that
to
what
mr.
owens
referred
by
reason
on
the
finding
of
conspiracy
and
that
therefore
punitive
damages
was
allowable
even
they're
guiding
this
as
a
â€“
under
state
law.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
do
you
--
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
your
interpretation
of
tennessee
law
is
that
in
order
to
impose
punitive
damages
upon
a
principle
where
the
liability
is
based
on
respondeat
superior,
you
must
also
fill
in
more
conspiracy.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
principle
need
not
be
a
member
according
to
that
conspiracy
that
this
principle
have
to
be.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
an
act?
i
ask
you
these
questions
because
i
get
the
feeling
that
there
was
some
what
shall
i
say,
confusion
or
overlapped
in
the
proceedings
in
this
case
today
between
the
federal
and
the
state
theory
and
if
it
is
conceded
that
what
we
now
have
is
a
case
on
which
damages
were
awarded
under
state
law
regardless
of
the
source
of
jurisdiction
then
i
suppose
that
it
would
be
relevant
to
say
whether
the
damages,
area
of
the
damages
accords
with
the
principles
of
the
state
law
or
whether
perhaps
there
again,
there
has
been
some
infection
from
the
presence
of
a
originally
in
the
complaint
of
a
federal
cause
of
action.
justice
abe
fortas
was
sanchez
case
really
do
agree
that
sanchez
held
that
whether
as
a
general
verdict
and
one
theory
which
appeared
then
the
liability
of
general
verdict
was
banned
and
valid
that
retried
case
has
been
the
first
to
remand
for
retrial.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
