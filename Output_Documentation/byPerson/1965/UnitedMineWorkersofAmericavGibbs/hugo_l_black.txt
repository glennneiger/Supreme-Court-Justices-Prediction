based
on
federal
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
about
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
important
deal
--
because
evidently
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
could
be
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
all
we
have
to
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
questioning
the
deal
as
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
are
you
going
to
argue
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
on
a
sunday?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
charge
the
jury
on
section
6?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
charged
that
he
referred
to
six?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
was
the
evidence,
it
being
here
that
has
been
expressly
authorized?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
on
the
interpretation
of
that
section
given
in
the
cognitive
case
on
the
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
point
is
that
so
far
as
[inaudible]
expressly
authorize,
there
was
no
authority
given
from
which
you
have
inferred
and
there
were
no
evidence
for
ratification.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
your
federal
claim
is
as
i
understand
it
in
that
connection,
congress
has
passed
a
law,
[inaudible]
violation
and
as
to
cases
of
this
kind,
labor
dispute,
there
must
be
actual
proof
of
express
authority
or
ratification
for
the
judgment
in
the
[inaudible]
against
the
union
--
or
union
of
this
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
federal
question
you're
claiming.
you
don't
have
--
its
the
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
claim
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
particularly
claim
here
that
will
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
and
you
have
several
legal
questions
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
if
you
–
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
i
understand
your
claim
that
[inaudible]
what
you're
claiming
is
that
the
[inaudible]
are
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
the
court
held
however
that
in
case
of
violence,
there
was
no
preemption.
as
i
understand
it,
i
may
be
wrong,
you're
claiming
it
now
that
[inaudible]
you're
claiming
that
the
burden,
they
would
rest
on
[inaudible]
at
that
time
it
was
decided
there
was
no
federal
remedy
for
an
action
of
violence
but
that
there's
now
[inaudible]
violence
and
therefore
that
that's
unbecoming
[inaudible]
as
part
of
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
answer
you
have
to
give?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
all
the
rules
have
the
same
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
speaking
of
is
he
claimed
about
picketing
up
and
engaging
in
violence
the
arrest
and
so
forth,
he'd
been
injured,
and
then
you
put
it
on
two
legal
fields,
one
on
the
state
law
and
one
on
the
federal
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
you
could
state
the
two
separate
causes
of
action
in
one
set?
what
you
have
here
is
they
have
a
[inaudible]
there
and
engaged
in
dispute,
picketing
and
violence
and
this
man
claimed
he
heard
about
it.
he
wants
to
put
all
the
legal
grounds
he
could,
one
of
them
happen
to
be
the
state
law
and
one
of
them
happens
to
federal
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
walker.
justice
hugo

black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo

black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
here
is
just
resting
on
the
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
[inaudible]
what
i'm
talking
about
is,
if
you
have
a
suggestion
[inaudible]
under
tennessee
law
that
there
had
been
no
violence
of
any
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
have
his
judgment,
a
basic
part
on
peaceful
persuasion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
be
vague.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
have
to
be
violent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
and
you
prove
that
if
there
has
been
no
violence,
wouldn't
that
had
been
preemption,
nothing
but
peaceful
[inaudible]
wouldn't
that
had
been
preemption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
–
forget
303.
suppose
they
have
constituted
state
law
for
this
labor
dispute
alleged
that
peaceful
[inaudible]
to
persuade
them
and
not
to
go
to
work,
would
there
have
been
preemption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
would
have,
because
all
you
have
is
you
have
that.
that's
the
basis
of
your
basis
case
you
don't
have
to
have
clients
if
you
say
they
were
some
violence
too.
why
would
that
not
apply
then,
would
it
not
be
preempted
if
a
large
party
who's
based
on
a
peaceful
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
--
you
got
the
judge
a
favor
that's
barred
on
something
that
preempted
in
the
federal
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
and
--
which
did
not
require
proof
of
violation
at
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
happen
to
be
violent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that's
what
makes
your
case
new
and
different
isn't
it,
from
laburnum
and
the
others.
here
you
use
to
say
that
since
violence
is
not
required
at
all,
but
that
you
get
your
judgment
on
peaceful
persuasion,
how
do
we
know
you
didn't
get
it
in
for
peaceful
persuasion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
way
to
find
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
inform
you
couldn't
have
gotten
any
punitive
damages
but
for
the
fact
you
agreed
that
you
just
had
the
peaceful
persuasion
malicious
into
just
a
peaceful
persuasion.
you
could
have
gotten
any
punitive
damages.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
--
was
anything
said
in
those
rules
about
section
6,
isn't
that
right,
the
lawsuit
and
because
it's
the
governing
lawsuit.
