mr.
clarence
walker
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
affirmation
of
a
judgment
entered
by
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee
against
the
united
mine
--
international
union
--
united
mine
workers
of
america
in
the
amount
of
$75,000
in
favor
of
paul
gibbs,
an
individual.
it
was
alleged
that
the
united
mine
workers
had
violated
section
303
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
of
the
common
law
of
tennessee.
the
basic
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
almost
all
of
the
coal
lands
in
this
mountainous
area
of
southern
tennessee
is
either
owned
or
controlled
by
two
major
corporations.
one
is
the
tennessee
products
and
chemical
company,
the
other
is
the
tennessee
consolidated
coal
company.
each
of
these
corporations
operated
to
--
operated
a
large
mine
and
each
subcontracted
or
subleased
other
small
truck
mines
on
their
land
and
they
purchased
the
coal
and
then
sold
it
mainly
to
the
tba.
and
almost
all
if
not
all
of
the
mines
on
--
in
this
area,
on
the
lands
of
these
two
corporations
was
under
contract
with
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
and
had
been
for
a
number
of
years.
in
the
spring
of
1960
the
con
--
tennessee
consolidated
canceled
its
contract
with
umwa
or
that
covered
its
large
mine,
it's
coal
valley
mine
that
it
operated
itself.
it
sought
then
from
umw
economic
concessions
and
i
think
they
describe
it
as
a
contract
that
they
could
live
with.
these
negotiations
proved
fruitful
--
did
not
proved
fruitful
and
the
mine
shutdown
in
march
15,
1960.
it
had
been
apparent
for
a
number
of
years
that
this
coal
valley
mine
was
working
out
and
that
they
would
have
to
make
a
new
opening
some
place
on
their
land
and
the
tennessee
consolidated
officials
had
promised
their
old
line
employees
that
when
they
moved
to
a
new
area
which
was
called
the
gray's
creek
area,
that
they
would
receive
this
employment,
but
failing
in
obtaining
a
new
contract,
consolidated
did
something
else.
they
formed
a
--
the
grundy
mining
corporation,
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
and
placed
in
charge
of
that
corporation
its
attorney
and
labor
adviser,
a
man
named
of
justin
harwood.
the
other
officers
of
the
grundy
mining
corporation
were
the
officers
of
the
tennessee
consolidated
coal
company.
mr.
harwood
then
contacted
the
southern
labor
union
that
operated
in
northern
tennessee
and
a
rival
union
to
the
united
mine
workers
of
america,
after
ascertaining
that
that
contract
would
be
satisfactory
to
tennessee
consolidated
and
grundy
and
that
ascertaining
that
the
southern
labor
union
would
recruit
miners
or
replacements
to
go
to
work
in
this
new
gray's
creek
area,
he
then
contacted
paul
gibbs,
the
respondent
here.
paul
gibbs
had
operated
several
coal
mines,
not
on
tennessee
consolidated
land
but
on
the
--
its
competitor,
the
tennessee
products
and
chemical
company,
two
small
truck
mines.
gibbs
also
operated
a
fleet
of
eight
trucks
which
he
hauled
the
coal
from
his
mine
and
from
other
mines
in
the
area.
so
on
august
the
12th,
on
the
evening
of
august
the
12th,
harwood
called
mr.
gibbs
and
offered
him
a
job
as
mine
superintendent
of
these
new
mines
that
grundy
intended
to
open
up
in
the
gray's
creek
area
at
the
rate
of
$600
per
month.
in
addition
to
that,
he
offered
them
a
job
at
mr.
gibbs'
suggestion
to
haul
coal
from
this
mine
at
the
rate
of
78
cents
per
ton
and
this
was
agreed
upon.
and
mr.
harwood
then
informed
gibbs
that
they
would
have
employees
in
this
gray's
creek
area
on
monday
morning
and
they
were
then
to
start
opening
these
new
mines.
over
the
weekend,
all
of
these
was
unbeknownst
to
the
old
coal
valley
employees
or
to
the
united
mine
workers
of
america.
and
over
the
weekend
after
the
telephone
conversation,
the
word
got
out
or
at
least
rumors
that
consolidated
intended
to
open
the
new
mines
in
the
gray's
creek
area.
and
on
sunday,
umw's
local
union
5881
held
a
special
meeting
in
which
these
matters
were
discussed.
and
from
that
meeting,
several
of
the
members
decided
to
go
to
the
gray's
creek
area
on
monday
morning
to
determine
whether
the
rumors
were
correct.
the
international
union
or
district
19
of
the
united
mine
workers
representative
in
this
area
was
named
george
gilbert.
george
gilbert
left
southern
tennessee
to
go
to
middlesboro,
kentucky
on
saturday
to
attend
an
executive
board
meeting
of
district
19
and
did
not
know
anything
about
these
events.
on
monday
morning
mr.
gibbs
showed
up
early.
there
he
--
but
there
were
no
employees
there.
the
three
members
of
this
local
union
arrived
and
they
inquired
from
mr.
gibbs
of
whether
or
not
this
gray's
creek
area
was
to
be
opened
up.
and
he
did
--
he
said
that
it
was
his
understanding
that
it
was
or
he
heard
something
to
that
effect,
but
the
recruited
replacements
or
the
--
that
were
to
come
in
or
take
these
jobs
had
lost
their
way.
so
they
didn't
show
up
and
so
mr.
gibbs
left.
later
on,
a
few
of
them
got
near
there
and
finding
mr.
gibbs
wasn't
there,
why
they
also
departed.
but
johnny
cane
who
was
a
field
worker
for
southern
labor
union
met
a
group
of
men
that
he
claimed
are
from
fort
aid,
that
he
said
that
some
of
them
were
armed
with
shotguns,
some
place
along
the
road.
and
he
asked
them
if
they
were
employees
of
the
grundy
mining
company
and
find
out
--
finding
out
that
they
weren't,
he
turned
around
and
left.
but
on
tuesday
morning
which
is
august
the
16th,
there
was
a
much
larger
group
there.
and
when
--
and
which
consisted
of
the
old
coal
valley
employees
and
members
of
local
5881.
and
when
mr.
gibbs
arrived
there,
he
testified
that
a
large
number
of
these
men
were
armed
and
there
were
shotguns
or
rifles.
and
that
they
told
him
to
get
out
of
his
truck
and
he
says
that
one
of
them
put
his
hand
on
him
and
that
he
got
out
and
they
stood
around
for
a
while
and
he
was
apprehensive
that
he
might
be
in
physical
danger.
and
during
this
time
they
also
stole
or
took
from
mr.
gibbs
his
gun
or
took
it
from
his
truck.
then
they
left
this
area,
the
gray's
creek
area
and
moved
out
this
mountainous
road
which
is
the
pocket
road
where
after
they'd
gone
a
short
distance,
they
ran
into
a
larger
group
of
men.
mr.
clarence
walker
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction
is
very
definitely
applicable
in
the
present
case
is
our
understanding
of
the
law.
the
complaint
as
filed
and
as
amended,
definitely
stated
a
cause
of
action
arising
under
a
federal
statute.
the
court
so
held.
even
though
the
court
may
determine
the
case
without
applying
the
federal
statute,
does
not
effect
the
period
of
pendent
jurisdiction
which
did
happen
in
this
case
when
the
judge
threw
out
the
303.
in
fact,
the
court
is
not
required
to
rely
on
the
federal
law
at
all.
as
quoted
in
the
soule
case,
a
constitutional
question
was
raised.
this
court
bypassed
that
question
and
said
we
need
not
to
answer
that
question.
we
can
decide
on
the
local
ground.
if
the
court
so
decides
under
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction,
they
may
decide
the
case
purely
on
the
local
basis
and
not
even
apply
the
federal
law.
mr.
clarence
walker
no
your
honor,
if
you
had
not
alleged
a
substantial
claim
under
a
federal
law,
constitution
or
some
treaty,
then
you
would
have
had
no
standing
in
a
federal
court
on
your
common
law
of
claim
at
the
first
citizenship.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
clarence
walker
we
claim
there
is
a
definite
substantial
claim.
mr.
clarence
walker
we
filed
--
this
under
the
two-theory
rule,
the
303
and
also
the
common
law.
mr.
clarence
walker
not
as
to
understanding
of
the
law,
your
honor.
this
is
an
incorporated
association
which
i
believe
in
the
last
session
was
ruled
or
affirmed
by
justice
fortas.
mr.
clarence
walker
i
do
not
see
the
exact
question
in
that
way,
your
honor.
i
see
it
this
way
that
laburnum
would
apply
on
the
common
law
actions.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes
your
honor
if
those
plead
on
a
--
mr.
clarence
walker
the
violence
going
into
on
the
common
law
account.
mr.
clarence
walker
and
the
case
of
an
assault
and
battery,
that
would
be
a
separate
cause
of
action.
you're
trying
to
combine
a
cause
of
action
for
personal
injury
with
a
separate
cause
of
action
for
a
business
interference
which
--
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
not
what
we
have
done.
mr.
clarence
walker
they
did
not
claim
in
their
cause
of
action
that
it
arose
under
303.
they
filed
they
could
not.
they
filed
only
for
the
violation
of
a
common
law
right.
mr.
clarence
walker
the
complaint
as
alleged
in
this
case
not
only
alleged
under
the
claims
of
mr.
gibbs
as
it
relates
to
his
contract
with
grundy
and
as
a
trucking
contractor
but
also
with
other
parties.
mr.
clarence
walker
no,
your
honor.
mr.
clarence
walker
no
sir,
he
makes
no
claim
of
a
personal
injury
if
--
mr.
clarence
walker
if
i
understand
the
morton
case
correctly,
we
come
out
with
the
problem
of
several
back.
one
if
it
is
lawful
picketing
with
peaceful
or
lawful
purpose
under
a
secondary
boycott
and
if
peaceful,
then
there
would
be
no
violation
of
federal
law.
if
you
have
an
unlawful
boycott
under
the
act
and
still
over
based
on
peaceful
picketing,
you're
limited
strictly
to
303.
if
you
have
--
mr.
clarence
walker
except
for
the
punitive
damages.
mr.
clarence
walker
it's
my
understanding
of
the
law.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clarence
walker
just
an
intentional
deliberate
act
to
--
mr.
clarence
walker
where
a
person
under
the
tennessee
law
violates
or
interferes
with
a
contractual
or
business
relationship
without
justification
in
this
call,
and
there
is
damage
results
such
as
withholding
the
benefits
for
contract,
that
is
required
to
be
malicious
and
intentional
under
our
cases.
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
correct
upon
the
basis
that
after
mr.
gilbert
returned
to
the
coal
field,
he
had
several
conversations
after
all
knowledge
of
the
violent
and
other
act
had
occurred
he
had
several
conversation
with
several
people
that
they
were
not
going
to
let
all
gibbs
get
by
with
this.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
showing
the
--
mr.
clarence
walker
it
would
possibly.
mr.
clarence
walker
--
be
peaceful
persuasion.
mr.
clarence
walker
it
does
not
have
to
be
violent.
mr.
clarence
walker
no,
your
honor.
if
you
had
filed
303
and
common
law
together.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes
there
would
have
been
--
mr.
clarence
walker
in
the
particular
case
we
have
here,
we
feel
that
the
affected
aspects
of
the
original
violence
carried
over
into
the
other
fields
of
it
as
held
in
the
[inaudible]
mr.
clarence
walker
on
the
common
law
camp,
if
it
is
purely
on
the
malicious
and
intentional
violation
--
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
correct.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes
your
honor.
the
violence
carried
on
several
days
after
this.
it
wasn't
just
strictly
on
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth.
it
was
on
the
seventeenth,
eighteenth,
the
22nd,
several
days
following
this,
the
--
there
was
a
--
the
threat
--
intentional
threat
of
violence
prevailing
over
the
area
which
we
feel
coincides
very
closely
with
the
persuasion
on
the
minds
of
men.
mr.
clarence
walker
we
have
no
way
of
determining
the
way
the
jury
determined
the
fact
on
it.
mr.
clarence
walker
no
way
for
us
to
find
out
and
we
feel
the
issue
on
that
would
be
foreclosed
by
the
jury
of
verdict
as
to
what
they
based
it
on,
on
strictly
the
peaceful
or
the
violence
and
the
record
as
it
stands
and
taken
as
a
whole,
we
feel
offers
sufficient
facts
to
prove
the
existence
of
violence,
threats
of
violence,
and
mass
picketing
or
mass
activities
after
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
to
warrant
the
jury
in
finding.
i'm
afraid
of
violence
contained
with
--
mr.
clarence
walker
not
under
303.
on
the
question
of
pendent
jurisdiction
as
i
said
previously
it
would
be
determined
as
of
the
time
the
action
was
filed
not
as
the
way
that
facts
ultimately
turned
out.
and
the
fact
that
the
judgment
may
at
this
time
be
based
on
the
common
law
of
the
county
entirely
would
not
take
away
from
the
district
court
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
jurisdiction
to
trial
the
case
has
decide
the
case
unless
they
were
to
show
that
we
had
been
foreclosed
by
some
rule
in
this
honorable
court
that
we
had
no
substantial
claim
or
that
it
was
frivolous.
and
this
was
a
case
that
was
very
vigorously
fault
from
the
very
beginning
to
the
end
and
i
believe
everyone
that
was
involved
realized
the
great
danger
of
error
in
the
trial
of
such
case.
and
the
remaining
of
the
question
that
could
have
arisen
were
decided
or
worked
out
in
chambers
or
arguments
were
held
in
chambers
in
an
effort
to
keep
from
the
jury
any
of
the
facts
that
might
tend
to
mislead
the
jury
in
bringing
in
an
incorrect
verdict.
we
very
vigorously
disagree
with
the
contentions
of
petitioner
on
the
effect
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
relation
to
this
act.
we
feel
that
the
standards
to
be
applied
either
under
your
303
or
under
your
common
law
would
have
been
only
the
common
law
rules
of
agency.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clarence
walker
it's
my
interpretation
of
the
act,
although
it
calls
for
accommodation
with
the
other
federal
acts,
that
it
would
have
been
very
applicable
had
we
sought
any
injunctions.
we
were
not
seeking
any
injunction.
mr.
clarence
walker
we
feel
in
this
particular
aspect
that
congress
and
the
history
of
303
and
301
with
taft-hartley
has
stated
that
they
desired.
mr.
clarence
walker
it
would
apply
to
301.
mr.
clarence
walker
and
it
applies
to
303.
mr.
clarence
walker
i
did
not
understand
--
mr.
clarence
walker
it
would
apply
--
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
question,
sir.
if
we
had
only
a
303,
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
our
contention
would
not
apply
to
--
mr.
clarence
walker
would
not.
mr.
clarence
walker
and
it
does
not
apply
in
the
case
where
we
have
pendent
jurisdiction.
the
standard
of
the
of
the
permanent
agent
--
mr.
clarence
walker
--
is
the
same
in
both
cases
the
common
law
rule
of
agency.
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
the
mandates
of
congress
in
the
legislative
history
in
returning
or
--
mr.
clarence
walker
and
with
reference
to
my
brief
your
honor,
i
made
mention
to
the
umw
versus
patent
case
where
part
of
the
legislative
history
is
quoted
and
quoted
from
the
legislative
history
of
labor
management
relation
act
by
--
to,
page
1622.
mr.
clarence
walker
it's
on
page
17,
mr.
justice.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
your
honor,
at
the
time
i
wrote
the
brief,
i
did
not
have
it
available
the
legislative
history,
but
in
checking
the
legislative
history
after
arriving
here,
i
find
that
this
provision
is
quoted
several
times
both
by
mr.
taft
and
mr.
hartley.
on
june
5,
conference
report
on
page
–
volume
2,
page
1537
of
the
same
publication.
mr.
clarence
walker
volume
2,
page
1537.
mr.
clarence
walker
no,
your
honor
that
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
labor
management
relation
act
as
published
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
i
also
make
reference
to
the
subdivision
as
to
agency
on
page
1543
or
1544
of
volume
2.
and
the
particular
quoted
pages
is
quoted
from
the
discussion
of
mr.
taft
in
correcting
some
misapprehensions
that
have
been
taken
as
to
some
of
his
previous
statements.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
your
honor,
the
quoted
statement
in
my
brief
is
quoted
--
mr.
clarence
walker
--
17
and
18
starting
with
section
2
and
ending
on
page
--
finishing
at
page
18
is
a
direct
quote
from
senator
taft
with
the
exception
of
that
eighth
line
up
there.
there
is
an
error
in
--
on
the
bottom
of
the
page
that
should
be
with
regulating
conduct.
mr.
clarence
walker
on
page
18.
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
a
typographical
error.
even
if
the
acts
of
or
the
requirements
of
section
6
--
if
the
requirements
of
section
6
were
applicable,
we
feel
that
the
evidence
as
introduced
in
this
call,
sufficiently
met
any
requirements
even
as
the
judge
charged
although
we
feel
it
may
have
been
little
stronger
than
was
necessary.
mr.
clarence
walker
we
feel
that
there
definitely
was.
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
correct.
that
is
a
statement
of
mr.
gibbs
as
of
the
morning
of
the
sixteenth.
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
all
there
is
as
to
mr.
gilbert
on
that
particular
day.
mr.
clarence
walker
we
feel
that
after
mr.
gilbert
returned
to
the
field
and
as
he
has
stated,
he
took
charge
of
the
activities.
we
have
placed
mr.
gilbert
on
a
picket
line
on
august
22nd
by
an
independent
witness
who
had
no
dealings
with
this.
mr.
clarence
walker
it
was
disputed,
but
the
court
or
the
jury
has
solved
that
issue
for
us.
mr.
clarence
walker
not
on
the
part
of
mr.
gibbs
as
mr.
gibbs
never
return
to
this
area.
mr.
clarence
walker
or
--
or
mr.
gibbs.
we
cannot
print
it
by
mr.
gibbs
as
to
any
related
violence
towards
third
persons,
only
picket
line
in
this
area,
we
do
not
know.
we
do
know
that
there
were
at
least
several
instances
where
there
was
violence
or
an
attempt
to
violence
such
as
a
mass
motorcade
going
to
a
third
person's
mine
mr.
george
ramsey
to
--
we
don't
know
the
exact
purpose,
but
it
was
shown
in
the
record
that
--
mr.
clarence
walker
i
think
the
overall
situation
was
more
or
less
directed
toward
mr.
gibbs
as
mr.
gibbs
had
previously
worked
for
mr.
ramsey.
and
as
one
of
the
basis
of
the
303
and
inducing
others
not
to
do
business
with
mr.
gibbs,
we
claim
that
mr.
ramsey
was
prevented
from
either
selling
to
him
or
allowing
him
to
engage
on
contracts
with
the
holding
of
the
court.
mr.
clarence
walker
the
district
court
felt
that
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
that,
although
that
was
one
of
our
allegations
and
was
approved
that
we
tendered.
mr.
clarence
walker
it
would
show
the
intent
of
the
defendant
through
mr.
gilbert
to
intimidate,
coerce
or
cause
any
of
the
people
in
the
entire
area
to
withhold
their
business
from
mr.
gibbs.
mr.
clarence
walker
well
at
the
time
the
proof
was
tendered
and
we
feel
that
it
did
go
to
the
303
action,
the
court,
district
court,
felt
that
it
did
not.
mr.
clarence
walker
we
did
not
appeal
from
the
district
court's
ruling
on
that
particular
point.
the
only
point
that
we
did
appeal
from
is
the
fact
of
the
damages
on
the
303.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes
it
goes
to
the
ratification
because
after
all
the
knowledge
of
every
act
that
had
occurred
on
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth,
mr.
gilbert
in
his
normal
duties
of
organizing
the
unorganized
and
settling
disputes
and
a
sector
as
he
sets
out
in
his
duties
was
an
effort
or
an
effort
to
keep
people
from
dealing
with
gibbs,
talk
with
these
other
people
and
intentionally
or
through
acts
of
the
workers
and
union
members
try
to
induce
fear
and
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
clarence
walker
they
went
on
the
ratification
i
feel
certain.
mr.
clarence
walker
statements
of
mr.
gilbert
in
relation
to
others
as
the
intention
of
the
district
and
the
international.
this
i
believe
--
mr.
clarence
walker
i
can't
definitely
state
the
intent
of
the
union
not
to
allow
mr.
gibbs
to
go
in
to
gray's
creek
and
to
do
the
work.
mr.
clarence
walker
the
intent
of
the
united
mine
workers
not
to
let
paul
gibbs
work
there.
the
umw
contended
in
an
unfair
labor
charge
that
mr.
gibbs
and
grundy
favored
southern
labor
union
and
that
is
cited
in
the
footnote
of
opponent's
brief.
mr.
clarence
walker
they
found
a
violation,
but
the
sixth
circuit
refused
to
enforce
it
saying
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence.
if
i
recall
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
case
that
it
did
not
show
that
they
were
going
to
favor
the
southern
labor
union
as
mr.
gibbs
said
in
the
--
as
quoted
in
that
case.
he
was
going
to
work
whoever
showed
up
where
they
started
umw
or
a
no
union,
he
just
wanted
to
--
he
was
going
to
work
whoever
showed
and
he
had
no
intent
one
way
or
the
other.
but
the
umw
does
show
their
intent
not
to
let
him
work
at
gray's
creek,
not
only
with
the
conversations
with
mr.
gibbs
himself
but
with
the
other
individuals
and
expressing
the
intent
that
they're
going
to
move
him
out
of
high
places.
the
--
mr.
clarence
walker
yes
your
honor.
mr.
clarence
walker
with
the
original
violence
on
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth,
if
the
union
after
stepping
in
continuing
or
continuously
picketing,
if
not
be
sufficient
under
the
holdings
of
the
milk
drivers
union
versus
meadowmoor
where
the
facts
of
extreme
violence
followed
that
peaceful
picketing
may
have
a
coercive
effect
upon
the
minds
of
men.
now
as
to
that
particular
point,
i
don't
know
if
it
would
have
been
sufficient
to
have
that
effect
but
i
feel
after
they
take
over
with
the
original
violence,
with
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
that
have
occurred
and
subsequently
reap
benefits
from
that
original
violence
they
have
ratified.
mr.
clarence
walker
not
necessarily.
if
the
violence
on
a
picket
line
is
not
extreme
violence,
i
mean
if
it's
of
ordinary
fight
between
two
men
or
some
abusive
language
which
similar
to
young
dowd
case,
that
in
itself
would
not
be
sufficient
unless
it
shows
that
eminent
threat
to
the
public
disorder
to
enjoin
any
further
picketing
or
to
prevent
further
picketing.
and
i
feel
in
such
case
as
that
the
union
would
probably
not
have
ratified
the
original
violence.
but
where
in
a
case
such
as
we
have,
the
extreme
violence,
they
come
in
and
they
take
over,
they
subsequently
ratify
the
original
conduct
because
they
reap
benefits
obtained
from
that
in
a
subsequent
contract
with
the
allen
and
garcia
company
as
brought
out
by
the
opponent
in
1961.
they
entered
into
negotiations
with
this
company
for
a
provision
of
agreement
regarding
the
working
conditions
and
training
conditions,
such
matters
as
that
and
mr.
gilbert
was
present
at
those.
and
in
the
future
negotiations
with
the
effect
that
mr.
gilbert
who
is
controlling
the
picketing
also
isn't
taking
part
in
these
vast
negotiations.
it
is
sufficient
in
my
belief
to
show
a
ratification
of
his
conduct
and
in
the
obtaining
our
future
benefits.
mr.
clarence
walker
on
the
22nd.
mr.
clarence
walker
there
is
a
testimony
by
mr.
schwok
who
--
mr.
clarence
walker
starting
on
page
159
of
the
transcript.
mr.
clarence
walker
mr.
schwok's
testimony
said
that
he
sold
the
card
as
for
mr.
gilbert
knowing
it
was
mr.
gilbert's
car
and
mr.
gilbert
came
out
of
the
woods
located
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
at
that
time
mr.
gilbert
advised
mr.
schwok,
you
can't
get
through
this
road
but
you
go
on
down
to
another
road
and
my
boys
will
let
you
through.
so
it
definitely
shows
he
had
complete
control
of
the
activities
of
the
men.
mr.
clarence
walker
well
mr.
schwok
was
stopped
at
the
picket
line.
he
was
a
dealer
in
mining
supplies
and
wanted
to
go
to
another
mine
in
area.
and
after
the
discussion
with
mr.
gilbert,
he
states
he
--
and
a
gentleman
with
him
decided
it's
no
place
to
be
and
left.
the
--
there
was
also
a
rifle
lying
on
a
log
i
believe
near
the
tent
where
the
pickets
were
located.
and
this
was
not
at
the
interest
to
the
gray's
creek
road
coming
up
on
to
the
public
access
road,
pocket
road.
this
was
located
approximately
50
yards
from
the
intersection
with
a
state
highway
and
was
not
at
the
area
at
the
gray's
creek
road.
and
that
was
a
road
that
the
way
i
understand
the
testimony
that
mr.
schwok
wanted
to
go
in,
they
had
it
block
50
feet
off
the
main
road
and
had
another
block
down
at
gray's
creek
and
told
him
he
could
not
go
in
there
but
to
go
on
down
the
road
to
another
place
and
come
back
in
although
he
had
other
pickets
down
there.
mr.
gilbert
was
also
placed
at
the
picket
line
on
another
occasion
when
he
dropped
food
off
to
feed
the
pickets
and
the
testimony
of
the
members
of
the
pickets
is
that
he
came
by
frequently
and
visit
the
equipment.
mr.
clarence
walker
they
acknowledge
that
all
activities
in
the
course
of
mr.
gilbert's
conduct
would
be
the
responsibility
and
liability
of
the
international.
mr.
clarence
walker
that
includes
the
peaceful
picketing
at
the
picket
line
or
the
picket
point.
mr.
clarence
walker
furnishing
of
the
food
and
also
one
of
mr.
gibbs'
other
mines,
there
was
a
burning
of
a
burlap
sack
in
the
mountain
with
mine
which
would
cause
suffocation
of
the
miners
inside
and
also
on
several
occasions
the
cutting
of
a
fan
belt
to
the
ventilation
fan
with
the
--
which
cut
off
the
ventilation
air
going
into
the
mine.
mr.
clarence
walker
and
not
to
the
gray's
creek
area
but
have
a
separate
mine
only
into
the
coal
valley
or
not
coal
valley
but
the
pocket
area.
there's
also
proof
of
mr.
--
or
that
mr.
gilbert
testified
that
he
talked
with
mr.
travis
who
at
the
time
was
the
general
superintendent
of
operation,
the
vice
president
of
operation
of
tennessee
products
and
chemical
corporation
that
felt
that
the
gibbs'
matter
is
going
to
interfere
or
he
showed
an
apprehension
that
the
problems
of
august
15
and
16
would
carry
over
not
just
with
gibbs
but
into
the
operation
of
the
tennessee
product's
mine.
and
the
discussion
seemed
to
be
carried
on
at
some
extent
and
finally,
mr.
gilbert
makes
the
statement
that
mr.
travis
said
he
was
going
behalf
to
get
rid
of
mr.
gibbs.
and
further
that
there
was
a
discussion
with
mr.
mabel
the
successor
to
mr.
gilbert
in
the
area
with
mr.
heuman
who
was
the
successor
of
mr.
travis.
and
mr.
heuman
recognized
that
in
discussions
with
mr.
mabel
that
the
union
was
or
had
displeasure
with
gibbs
and
stated
he
didn't
want
trouble
with
him.
and
also
they
brought
out
some
facts
that
he
--
or
mr.
gibbs
was
prevented
from
completing
a
second
contract
he
had
with
tennessee
products
on
a
market
cement
plant.
we
feel
that
that
was
brought
on
by
an
effort
of
the
discussions
or
the
intent
shown
by
the
union
that
they
did
not
want
gibbs
doing
anything
and
that
the
contract
was
canceled
after
approximately
8,
10,
12
years
of
very
successful
business
relations.
and
--
mr.
clarence
walker
that
was
mr.
gilbert's
--
mr.
clarence
walker
--
statement
to
mr.
gibbs,
i
believe
the
date
of
that
was
the
17th
or
the
18th.
mr.
clarence
walker
stay
out
of
the
gray's
creek
area.
mr.
clarence
walker
no,
your
honor,
this
is
deep
mines.
mr.
clarence
walker
deep
mines.
you
have
got
mechanical
mine
and
also
large
mechanical
mine
and
small
hand
loaded
mines.
mr.
clarence
walker
at
the
time
i
think
the
majority
of
them
were
but
at
this
time
i
don't
think
they
were
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
i
don't
--
mr.
clarence
walker
southern
labor
union.
mr.
clarence
walker
and
--
mr.
clarence
walker
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
the
southern
labor
union.
i
believe
that
it
is
a
smaller
union
more
or
less
dealing
with
mining
and
related
fields.
and
--
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
the
evidence
shows
that
a
number
of
them
came
up
on
the
first
two
days
and
that
they
did
not
come
back.
one
of
them
testified
or
several
of
them
testified
is
they
left
on
the
second
day
after
being
told
they
were
not
going
in.
mr.
clarence
walker
one
day
and
they
were
shot
at
one
states
--
one
time,
another
says
twice
as
they
left.
mr.
clarence
walker
mr.
gibbs.
mr.
clarence
walker
and
he
also
made
the
statement
--
mr.
clarence
walker
it
was
denied
and
several
others
have
made
a
similar
statement
showing
the
same
intent
of
the
umw.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes
your
honor.
it
was
decided
there.
that
--
we
feel
that
the
jury
closed
that
issue
as
to
veracity
and
truthfulness
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
clarence
walker
no.
we
feel
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
show
not
only
a
ratification
of
the
prior
violence
but
after
the
sixteenth,
that
the
umw
actively
participated
through
its
field
representative
george
gilbert
in
the
--
as
a
principle
actor
in
the
thing
as
he
had
the
control
of
the
various
miners
and
under
his
duties
as
a
field
representative,
he
used
to
organize
the
unorganized.
he
settled
grievances.
he
sat
in
on
contract
talks.
he
had
contracts
signed
with
the
operators
and
the
international
in
district
as
their
agent
representative
in
the
field.
mr.
clarence
walker
i
believe
at
the
time
mr.
gilbert
was
living
in
jasper
--
mr.
clarence
walker
jasper,
tennessee,
this
occurred
at
gray's
creek
which
is
located
approximately
five
miles,
six
miles
north
of
whitwell,
approximately
20
miles.
that's
an
estimate
from
mr.
gilbert's
home
and
the
various
activities
that
have
occurred
are
over
the
entire
range
of
practically
two
counties,
grundy
and
marin
county.
mr.
clarence
walker
none
as
i
recall
your
honor
that
personally
connects
mr.
gilbert
with
an
act
of
violence.
arising
out
of
this
same
transactions
and
as
quoted
by
opponent's
brief,
in
these
several
nlrb
hearings,
and
one
the
local
union
has
been
found
guilty
of
civil
contempt
arising
out
of
the
enforcement
order
that
was
issued
or
in
the
case

and
the
local
was
held
in
that
case
with
civil
contempt
and
subsequently
local
783
and
5881
and
district
19
were
found
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practices
failing
to
file
his
30
days
of
picketing
and
acts
of
violence
under

and
those
are

versus
local
7083
of
5881
and
district
19,

in
1963.
further
the
ratification
of
all
these
prior
violent
acts
are
shown
when
the
umw
has
taken
advantage
of
these
acts
by
recruiting
new
members
in
the
area
and
getting
contract
with
other
operators,
and
obtaining
the
benefits
not
only
of
the
dues
but
welfare
payments.
we
feel
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
on
question
number
three
that
they're
entitled
to
a
new
trial
that's
based
entirely
on
the
fact
that
the
judge
felt
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
verdict
and
therefore
ordered
a
remittitur
and
this
is
not
as
the
cases
have
been.
it
is
strictly
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
to
rule
upon
the
excessiveness
of
the
verdict
and
whether
or
not
it
had
been
invaded
by
the
prejudice
of
argument.
mr.
clarence
walker
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not
in
my
brief.
i
do
not
represent
the
grundy
mining
company
or
tennessee
consolidated
company
and
were
only
made
known
to
me
after
i
came
up
to
washington
approximately
a
week
ago.
and
they
were
not
cited
in
the
brief
as
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
proceedings
that
had
followed
this
particular
area
to
deal
with
at
that
time.
mr.
clarence
walker
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'll
leave
that
to
the
clerk
to
be
[inaudible]
mr.
clarence
walker
any
error
that
might
have
been
alleged
in
the
improper
argument
of
jury
which
we
do
not
feel
was
--
are
prejudicial.
it
may
have
been
improper,
but
there
was
no
showing
of
prejudice
upon
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
umw.
it
is
most
difficult
to
try
a
case
let
alone
argue
a
case
to
a
jury
where
you
have
the
facts
such
as
are
involved
in
this
case
where
the
possibility
that
the
facts
themselves
might
create
some
problems
with
the
juror.
in
fact
that
a
man
meets
eight
men
in
a
road,
armed
with
shotguns
and
rifles
stopping
his
truck
and
making
him
get
out
and
standing
two
hours
under
the
threat
of
death
is
the
fact
that's
spelled
out
in
the
case
wasn't
discuss
with
the
jury
or
even
heard
by
the
jury
might
intend
to
make
him
feel
a
little
harsh
toward
the
person
that
does
such.
the
fact
that
the
verdict
was
reduced
has
no
bearing
we
feel
as
to
whether
it
was
infected
with
bias,
prejudice
or
sympathy.
there
were
strictly
matters
addressed
to
this
trial
court
in
a
motion
for
new
trial,
and
in
the
exercise
of
his
judgment
or
discretion,
he
felt
that
they
were
excessive
based
on
evidence
of
the
material
in
it
that
he
is
not
on
the
basis
of
any
prejudice,
bias,
or
misconduct.
he
reduced
the
compensatory
damages
on
the
loss
of
contract
as
he
felt
they
were
excessive.
and
as
he
states,
there
was
not
prejudice
but
strictly
excessiveness
on
that
particular
point.
the
rule
as
applied
by
the
judge
and
as
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
is
one
that
has
been
in
effect
for
many
years
and
strictly
goes
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
unless
there
is
an
abuse
very
seldom
are
ever
interfered
with.
we
do
not
feel
that
there
was
an
erroneous
theory
submitted
to
the
jury.
we
feel
that
if
there
was
in
an
error
arising
from
that
has
been
waived
by
the
petitioner.
the
case
well
known
by
all
parties
involved
was
very
touchy.
the
court
had
many
conferences
with
counsels.
the
court
discussed
the
special
interrogatories
which
he
planned
to
submit
to
the
jury.
the
petitioner
had
an
opportunity
if
he
was
in
disagreement
with
the
issues
that
were
going
to
be
submitted,
to
submit
different
suggestion
or
question
which
they
did
not
do.
they
did
not
object
to
the
form
of
the
questions.
after
the
jury
had
retired
and
the
deliberated
on
its
verdict
and
had
returned
the
verdict
to
the
court,
they
did
not
at
that
time
note
any
inconsistency
or
make
any
remarks
or
objections
that
the
verdict
was
inconsistent
and
requested
the
judge
resubmit
the
matter
to
the
jury
for
determining
any
inconsistency.
but
let
the
jury
be
discharged,
we
feel
that
under
the
practice
that
has
grown
up
in
the
various
districts
and
under
the
federal
rules
that
they
waived
any
right
they
had
to
have
all
the
issues
determined
by
the
jury
and
the
rest
to
be
determined
by
the
judge
which
in
this
case
we
feel
the
judge
has
properly
done.
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
correct.
mr.
clarence
walker
on
the
period
of
conspiracy
which
was
charged
in
this,
there
are
recoveries
allowed
for
conspiratory
for
punitive
damages
where
it
shows
oppressive,
fraud
or
conduct
that
is
oppressive.
that
is
the
cases
on
those
are
cited
in
the
brief
that's
brumley
versus
chattanooga
motordrome.
mr.
clarence
walker
they
found
i
believe
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
common
law
rights
of
the
--
mr.
gibbs.
mr.
clarence
walker
where
the
conduct
in
the
violation
of
a
contractual
right
or
relation,
the
conduct
be
such
that
in
first
and
intentional
desire
without
justification
to
harm
someone,
there
would
be
sufficient
proof
there
to
award
punitive
damages.
on
the
agency
problem,
most
of
the
cases
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
do
show
a
conspiracy
or
a
combination
two
or
more.
mr.
clarence
walker
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clarence
walker
the
principle
would
not
have
to
be.
there
would
be
a
derivative,
the
agent
to
derive
his
authority
from
the
principle
and
any
act
which
he
does
in
accordance
of
the
conspiracy,
although
the
other
conspirator
maybe
hundred
miles
away,
anything
done
in
the
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
would
be
binding
and
all
would
be
liable.
mr.
clarence
walker
the
case
was
originally
tried
by
mr.
joe
bernadette
who
is
now
deceased
and
as
to
all
the
ins
and
outs
in
various
thinking,
i
was
not
in
on
the
contents
of
all
those
of
their
time
in
the
associate.
but
in
reviewing
what
papers
i
have,
i
feel
that
the
basis
of
the
case
is
on
the
same
grounds
in
accordance
to
the
federal
and
state
law.
and
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
sanchez
growers
case
as
that
was
something
that
was
prohibited
by
state
law
that
a
conspiracy
be
able
to
be
found
between
the
two
cooperatives
and
therefore
you
could
not
have
a
conspiracy
where
it
is
already
been
prohibited.
therefore
in
that
case,
you
could
not
have
a
conspiracy.
therefore
the
error
about
a
judge
in
the
charge
of
the
court
was
sufficient
to
reverse
that
case
but
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
the
problem
as
found
in
the
sanchez
case.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
clarence
walker
if
it's
inconsistent
to
one
another
in
this
particular
case
it
was.
in
the
sanchez
case
the
cooperative
could
not
be
charged
under
antitrust
act
due
to
the
fact
that
they
were
specifically
exempt
under
volstead-capper
act.
and
the
judge
in
making
his
charge
to
the
jury
so
worded
the
charges
that
it
could
be
a
misleading
or
erroneous
theory
that
the
jury
could
have
found
on.
mr.
clarence
walker
but
i
don't
think
that
is
in
our
present
case.
mr.
clarence
walker
well
your
honor,
that's
the
one
i
have
which
cites
gibbs,
this
is
federal
case
in
the
district
court
in
tennessee
but
reviews
the
tennessee
law
applies
it
goes
over
the
tennessee
cases
that
hold
that.
this
is
the
one
case
that
i
do
know
of
and
it's
the
main
clearest
expression
of
that
doctrine.
i
want
to
refer
to
the
labor
board
cases.
i
understand
--
mr.
clarence
walker
and
i
want
--
i'll
try
and
do
that.
i
won't
say
that
the
labor
board
great
cases
that
were
involved.
now
the
--
there
was
no
ratification
by
conduct
that
the
labor
board
found
contemptuous.
this
contempt
of
the
labor
board
order
was
after
this
case
was
even
tried
so
that
the
conduct
there
did
not
even
involved
gibbs
and
could
not
be
considered
as
ratification
of
the
conduct
in
gibbs.
now
there
was
a
labor
board
complaint
and
a
board
order
against
local
5881,
a
cease
and
desist
order
alleging
that
that
local
union
but
not
the
international
union
and
not
district
19
had
violated
section
8
(b)
1
(a).
and
that
there
was
later
–
by
later
conduct
they
held
that
the
local
union
had
contempt
of
the
action
but
not
in
relation
to
the
gibbs
incident.
and
i
want
to
refer
to
the
testimony
of
this
man's
quote,
the
man
who
testified
that
he
found
gibb
or
gilbert
along
the
road
but
he
was
not
picketing,
that
he
found
him
and
he
came
out
of
the
woods
and
asked
directions
to
a
coal
mine.
he
said,
“no,
you
can't
go
this
way.”
he
was
not
telling
you
can't
go
down
this
road
we're
picketing.
but
he
was
asking
the
direction
to
another
coal
mine
and
he
said,
“you
can't
get
there
that
way.
you
have
to
get
down
here
to
another
road”
and
he
said,
“you'll
find
some
of
my
men
there,”
i
think
he
referred
to
him
and
tell
him,
“i
said
that
you
can
go
on
through”
and
i
don't
think
form
that
fact
that
a
representative
calls
the
members
or
people
down
there
or
tell
him
my
men
that
that
constitutes
these
men
are
picketing
on
behalf
of
the
united
mine
workers
of
america.
particularly
these
people
are
employees,
he
started
of
this
picketing
in
their
own
individual
capacity.
then
it
was
--
the
point
was
raised
about
action
regarding
george
ramsey,
another
coal
operator
and
howard
hueman,
and
woody
travis
who
represented
the
tennessee
products
and
chemical
corporation.
now
we
didn't
loose
every
point
down
in
the
district
court.
we
got
a
directed
verdict
on
that
point
and
never
went
to
the
jury.
and
they
withdrew
all
of
that
evidence
from
the
jury
because
they
alleged
the
secondary
boycott
involving
those
companies
which
was
completely
separate
cause
of
action
and
for
which
he
offered
no
proof
of
what
he
alleged.
so
that
cannot
be
the
basis
of
finding
liability
by
umwa.
the
second
thing
is
that
all
of
the
employees,
the
replacement
employees
left
before
the
conversation,
the
telephone
conversation
that
gibbs
had
with
gilbert
which
gilbert
said
to
the
effect,
“we
don't
want
you
to
bring
in
the
southern
labor
union
in
here.”
and
that
conversation
had
nothing
to
do
with
these
employees
not
coming
in
the
area.
of
course
any
labor
union
in
america
would
resent
them
bringing
in
another
labor
union
or
bringing
in
replacement
of
these
employees.
then
the
--
it
raised
the
point
and
the
court
referred
to
this
about
that
there
was
smoke
in
one
of
mr.
gibbs'
mines.
what
that
testimony
is
that
one
of
the
employees
who
testified
on
our
behalf
said
that
a
man
running,
holding
the
coal
out
said
that
a
rag
caught
on
fire
and
he
took
the
rag
out
and
so
there
was
no
trouble.
that
was
the
smoke
incident.
nothing
had
anything
to
do
with
the
gibbs'
incident
with
grundy
or
the
employment
in
grundy.
and
another
time,
they
didn't
even
know
when
this
was.
they
said
that
the
belt
was
cut.
there
is
no
evidence
to
how
it
was
cut,
why
it
was
cut,
were
those
accidental,
or
what
was
involved,
or
even
the
time
that
was
involved.
and
so
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sense
of
--
list
thing
--
reason
i
didn't
mention
it.
now
on
the
question
of
the
application
of
section
6,
the
patent
case
was
cited.
and
the
patent
case
applying
the
common
law
of
agency
that
that
was
strictly
a
section
303
cause
of
action
and
there
was
--
mr.
clarence
walker
i
think
that
yes
--
mr.
clarence
walker
well
he
--
counsel
referred
to
the
patent
case,
but
i
think
that
it's
in
section
301.
i
don't
whether
i
can
recall
the
exact
wording.
it
said
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
which
is
301,
that
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
--
specific
acts
were
authorized
or
participated
in
or
ratified
shall
not
be
controlling.
and
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
what
was
intended
by
that
that
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
6
should
not
be
applied
and
that
the
common
law
of
agency
would
be
applied
to
that
section
and
to
the
taft-hartley
law
but
not
to
--
mr.
clarence
walker
no,
i
--
mr.
clarence
walker
i
do
not
have
a
section
before
me,
your
honor,
but
i
think
--
if
you're
referring
to
the
sections
were
they
give
the
definitions
of
what
constitute
agency
which
i
think
that
has
been
interpreted
to
apply
to
all
sections
of
the
taft-hartley
act
but
taft-hartley
act
alone.
and
that
we
contend
that
though
that
as
to
the
state
cause
of
action,
there
shows
that
the
section
6
of
norris-laguardia
act
applies.
merely
to
sum
up,
we
think
that
by
finding
union
responsibility
here
for
what
george
gilbert
did
that
there
couldn't
be
any
greater
conflict
or
greater
frustration
of
congressional
intent.
its
purpose
of
course
is
to
reduce
industrial
conflict.
what
they
do
here
in
this
case
is
make
the
union
liable
for
stepping
in
and
saying,
“we'll
have
peaceful
lawful
conduct.”
now
what
does
the
union
to
do
in
a
situation
like
that?
is
it
now
to
investigate
every
situation
to
determine
and
then
weigh
the
evidence
to
who's
telling
the
truth
or
whether
it
was
violence
or
not,
and
then
say
to
the
employees,
“from
now
on,
you're
no
longer
entitled
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
and
your
rights
are
in
an
end.”
