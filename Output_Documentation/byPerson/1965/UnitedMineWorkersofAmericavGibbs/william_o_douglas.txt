you've
omitted
what
i
thought
was
your
most
important
question
as
of
--
one
of
preemption.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
not
question
two,
question
two
isn't
--
has
to
do
--
as
you
stated
with
norris-laguardia,
this
preemption
deals
with
section
303.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we've
been
pretty
free
and
easy
in
letting
cases
go
to
a
jury,
i
guess
on
factual
determinations.
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
law
--
this
charge
under
509
(a)
doesn't
seem
to
be
suspect?
it
follows
the
norris-laguardia?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
i
understand
that.
