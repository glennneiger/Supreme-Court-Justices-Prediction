[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question,
one
question
before
you
leave.
it
isn't
your
real
point
here
that
the
jury
verdict
which
is
a
general
verdict,
you
can't
tell
from
the
verdict
whether
they
decided
it
on
federal
grounds
or
under
state
grounds.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
you're
--
so
if
it
was
decided
on
state
grounds,
there's
no
punitive
damages
on
the
respondeat
superior
theory
whereas
on
federal
law
there
was
evidence
to
support
it,
there
would
be
punitive
damages
allowed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
that's
what
i
understood
your
point
