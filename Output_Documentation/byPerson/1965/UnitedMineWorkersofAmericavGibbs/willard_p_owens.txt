mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes,
this
is
from
the
evidence
as
given
by
the
plaintiff.
although
this
was
denied
by
the
witnesses
of
the
defense
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
--
but
this
has
been,
i
think
determined
by
the
jury
against
us
on
that.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
object
of
the
picketing
which
is
involved
here
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
tie-in
on
the
question
of
preemption
because
these
employees
that
were
there
and
told
the
other
replacements
that
what
--
that
these
jobs
had
been
promised
them
and
what
they
were
doing
there
was
picketing
this
plant
if
you
call
it
--
these
mines,
if
you
call
it
picketing
in
order
for
them
to
get
the
jobs
and
i
think
it
also
goes
into
a
determination
of
union
responsibility.
this
was
a
suit,
the
international
union's
responsibility
for
conducting
which
he
did
not
participate.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
one
of
the
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes,
there
was
and
we
claimed
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
but
to
continue
on,
there
he
--
johnny
came
at
this
instance,
the
contents
of
his
briefcase
was
burned.
then
when
they
all
left
and
he
was
struck
two
or
three
times
by
somebody
that
was
in
this
group,
then
when
they
all
left,
one
of
the
vehicles
in
which
the
placement
--
replacement
employees
were
driving
the
--
there
was
a
bullet
in
the
rear
fender
of
that
vehicle
and
they
all
left.
now
george
gibb
--
this
took
place
in
--
the
time
of
this
was
about
two
hours.
it
took
two
hours
of
time
for
all
of
these
to
occur.
then
around
noon,
a
mine
committee
man
called
middlesboro,
kentucky,
the
district
19
officials
and
then
informed
them
that
the
mine,
the
gray's
creek
area
was
about
to
open
up.
and
that
there
had
been
picketing
there
and
there
were
replacements
to
take
their
jobs.
district
19
officials
then
instructed
george
gilbert
to
return
to
southern
tennessee.
and
also
instructed
him
that
he
was
to
see
that
there
be
no
violence,
that
if
there
was
picketing
that
that
picketing
be
limited
in
number.
and
also
to
ensure
that
the
picketing
be
conducted
in
such
a
way
that
it
did
not
interfere
with
any
of
the
other
mining
operations
in
the
area.
and
george
gilbert
did
return
to
southern
tennessee
on
the
evening
of
august
the
16th
and
after
several
days,
he
was
able
to
accomplish
this
and
there
was
picketing
at
the
intersection
of
the
pocket
road
in
the
main
highway
for
a
period
of
eight
and
a
half
months
by
the
three
to
five
employees.
none
of
the
other
mining
operations
were
affected.
the
employees
and
the
members
of
the
united
mine
workers
continued
to
cross
the
picket
line
including
the
employees
of
mr.
gibbs
that
were
working
in
his
mine.
several
of
the
operators
testified,
the
small
operators
testified
that
after
this
period
of
time,
george
gilbert
told
them
and
also
gibbs
that
they
did
not
intend
or
the
words
to
the
affect
for
the
southern
labor
union
to
come
in
to
this
field
or
intend
to
have
mr.
gibbs
bring
the
southern
labor
union
into
this
field.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
violence
on
the
picket
line.
there
is
testimony
which
is
referred
to
in
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
that
in
the
city
or
in
the
town
of
palmer,
which
is
small
palmer
--
a
small
town,
there
was
a
large
gathering
of
men
around
the
company
store
which
included
members
of
the
united
mine
workers
and
also
officials
of
the
tennessee
consolidated
company.
and
that
they
made
threats
to
the
officials
of
tennessee
consolidated,
two
officers
of
the
tennessee
consolidated
and
grundy
and
that
some
of
them
were
armed.
and
particularly
the
one
that
grabbed
a
hold
of
one
of
the
officers,
a
man
named
gary,
but
the
court
of
appeals
noting
that
some
of
these
were
members
ignored
the
fact
that
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
dispute
with
gibbs,
that
this
man,
gary,
thought
that
he
was
being
accused
of
stealing
from
the
company
warehouse.
he
was
a
guard
or
a
night
watchman.
he
was
not
a
coal
miner
and
i
don't
think
he
was
even
a
member.
the
record
shows
he
was
even
a
member
of
the
united
mine
workers
and
this
dispute
though
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
gibbs'
dispute,
although
the
court
of
appeals
does
refer
to
that.
but
that
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that
was
august
the
17th.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
mr.
gilbert
testified
that
it
took
him
several
days
in
order
to
do
what
he
wanted
to
do
and
that
was
to
make
sure
that
there
be
a
limited
picketing,
it'd
be
peaceful
and
not
in
violation
with
any
or
interference
with
any
other
mine.
then
in
november,
latter
part
of
november,
united
mine
workers
gave
some
groceries
in
form
of
vouchers
to
some
of
the
unemployed
coal
miners,
miners
that
had
been
unemployed
since
march
whose
work
--
unemployment
compensation
had
expired,
gave
them
$25
a
week.
and
some
of
these
recipients
of
these
groceries
also
were
pickets
on
this
picket
line
and
i
presume
some
of
them
were
--
participated
in
the
activities
of
august
the
15th
and
16th.
then
in
the
spring
of
1961,
tennessee
consolidated
decided
to
reopen
its
old
coal
valley
mine
and
it
contracted
with
another
corporation
from
chicago,
the
allen
and
garcia
company
to
operate
this
mine.
allen
and
garcia
signed
a
contract
with
umwa
and
it
went
back
to
work.
it
operated
for
approximately
one
year
and
then
the
mine
caved
in
and
then
allen
and
garcia
moved
over
to
the
gray's
creek
area,
opened
up
a
mine
and
the
grundy
mining
company
about
the
same
time
in
1962
in
august
also
opened
up
seven
or
eight
mines,
not
under
contract
with
umw.
that
was
the
factual
situation
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
now,
the
jury
in
this
case,
it
was
a
general
verdict
but
they
was
--
submitted
to
it
special
interrogatories.
the
jury
found
that
umw
had
violated
section
303
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
two
ways.
it
found
that
as
an
object
of
the
picketing
and
the
other
activity
was
to
force
or
require
the
grundy
mining
company
to
cease
doing
business
with
gibbs
as
mine
superintendent
and
to
--
and
the
second
one
was
to
cease
doing
business
with
gibbs
as
a
trucking
contractor.
it
also
found
that
umwa
had
violated
the
common
law
of
tennessee
by
entering
into
a
conspiracy
to
unlawfully
interfere
with
the
contract
between
the
grundy
mining
company
and
paul
gibbs.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes.
it
awarded
to
mr.
gibbs
$60,000
for
his
loses
for
--
as
mine
superintendent.
it
awarded
$14,500
for
his
loss
of
his
trucking
contract
and
it
awarded
$100,000
in
punitive
damages.
the
district
court,
in
acting
upon
umwa's
motion
for
judgment
n.o.v.
or
in
the
alternative
for
new
trial,
said
that
it
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
60,000.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
this
--
a
reward
of
compensatory
damages.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
he
was
paid,
they
paid
his
--
for
the
two
days
or
two
or
three
days
of
august
as
mine
superintendent
and
he
received
no
further
pay.
and
the
award
amounted
to
eight
and
a
half
--
$60,000,
about
eight
and
two
thirds
years
of
employment
as
mine
superintendent
even
though
the
evidence
was
to
the
effect
as
testified
by
the
company
that
the
job
was
only
going
to
last
about
eight
months
because
then
they
were
going
to
lease
these
mines
out
like
they
had
all
their
other
operations
once
they'd
got
them
under
development.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
oh,
these
damages
was
solely
based
upon
the
mine
superintendent
and
the
loss
of
his
trucking
contract
with
the
grundy
mining
company.
now
he
made
other
allegations
of
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well,
the
court
set
that
aside.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well,
he
offered
evidence
that
he
would
have
made
from
past
--
his
past
trucking
experience,
he
would
have
made
so
much
money.
he
estimated
the
amount
of
the
coal
and
he
estimated
what
it
would
cost
him
to
haul
the
coal
and
then
what
he
would
have
left
and
they
multiplied
that.
and
it
actually
came
up
with
about
$14,095
but
the
jury
gave
him
just
a
little
bit
more.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
it
was
set
aside
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
and
that
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
i
think
you're
correct.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
on
the
$60,000,
the
court
--
the
district
court
found
that
this
was
excessive
and
he
suggested
a
remittitur
of
$30,000
which
was
accepted
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that
was
affirmed.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
we
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
we
don't
raise
the
question
of
whether
there's
evidence
to
support
the
$30,000
here.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
raise
that
point
here.
but
the
district
court
found
that
on
the
question
of
union
responsibility
that
although
there
might
not
be
evidence
to
support
the
finding
of
a
union
responsibility
of
the
international's
responsibility
for
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth.
it
found
that
the
subsequent
picketing
to
that
time
was
sufficient
to
support
the
judgment
and
the
district
court
also
said
--
found
that
or
agreed
with
us
that
it
was
in
error
in
submitting
the
question
of
the
secondary
boycott
question
as
to
gibbs
as
a
mine
superintendent,
finding
that
he
was
not
any
other
person
as
mine
superintendent
with
a
meaning
--
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
which
requires
as
an
objective
of
the
union
that
they
--
forcing
or
requiring
any
person
to
cease
doing
business
with
any
other
person
and
then
the
court
--
the
court
found
that
in
that
aspect
of
the
case,
the
picketing
and
the
--
all
of
the
activity
was
primary
and
therefore
it
was
not
in
violation
of
the
federal
law.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes
we
do
in
effect
because
the
--
finally,
there
is
an
affirmation
of
a
judgment
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
there
is
not
onto
--
i
think
the
court
was
correct
and
we
don't
have
any
issue
as
to
the
--
whether
that
is
correct
or
not.
i
think
that
has
been
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well,
the
judgment
was
entered
then
on
--
also
on
the
violation
of
section
303
because
the
court
said
that
gibbs
was
a
--
any
other
person
within
the
meaning
of
that
section
as
a
trucking
contractor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
but
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
it
approves
the
judgment
of
compensatory
damages
of
$30,000
for
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
the
court
of
appeals
based
it
entirely
upon
a
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
right.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no.
that's
right.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
it
said,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
did
not
have
to
decide
that
because
the
verdict
could
be
supported
entirely
upon
state
law.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
one
of
the
issues,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes
your
honor
because
we
think
that
all
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
but
the
district
court
entered
judgment
for
the
violation
of
section
303
in
his
capacity
as
trucking
contractor
and
awarded
as
for
that
unlawful
interference
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
court
of
appeals
said,
it
didn't
have
to
decide
that
question.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
right.
it
said
that
it
did
not
have
to
decide
the
federal
question
because
the
federal
claim
was
not
so
plainly
unsubstantial
that
it
deprived
the
court
of
jurisdiction
and
that
the
state
claim
or
the
violation
of
state
law
supported
the
entire
judgment.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
the
first
question
we
asked.
the
question
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
question
of
union
responsibility
and
the
preemption
of
state
law
by
the
enactment
of
303.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what
we
depend
upon
in
our
question
of
union
responsibility.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
the
third
question
has
to
do
with
the
improper
argument
of
counsel.
we
claimed
that
they
should
have
ordered
a
new
trial
and
that
a
remittitur
did
not
cure
the
error
by
the
improper
appeal
to
the
passion
and
prejudice
of
the
jury.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
i
didn't
intend
that
--
we
--
had
asked
question
two.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
we
have
a
difficulty
in
forming
question
two
because
it
encompasses
both
the
question
of
union
responsibility
and
preemption.
may
--
but
may
i
go
into
that
then
in
--
and
what
our
position
is
on
that?
mr.
willard
p.
owens
let
me
go
into
the
union
responsibility
because
here
we
contend
that
there
was
not
proof
of
union
responsibility
for
the
unlawful
conduct
and
of
the
violence
of
august
the
15th
or
16th.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
proof
was
sketchy
as
to
union
responsibility.
and
if
that
were
so,
it
should
have
reversed
it
if
it
was
lacking
--
error
was
wanting
in
substance,
or
wanting
incompleteness.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
mr.
gibbs
submitted
a
variety
of
facts
to
prove
to
--
that
the
jury
could
infer
that
george
gilbert
instigated
the
actions
of
august
the
15th
and
16th.
although
that
wasn't
the
way
the
court
--
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
we
find
and
that
the
evidence
of
--
that
the
court
relied
upon
in
that
respect
was
that
mr.
gibbs
testified
that,
"i
am
thinking
that
i
saw
george
gilbert
in
the
gray's
creek
area
on
the
15th
or
16th
of
august,
but
he
didn't
take
part
in
any
of
these
activities
that
we
relate
here
as
unlawful
or
that
his
car
was
there."
we
don't
think
that
this
is
sufficient
evidence
to
find
the
--
that
george
gilbert
was
even
in
the
area,
let
alone
particularly
since
all
the
affirmative
povi
–
positive
proof
of
those
who
were
there
and
george
gilbert
on
the
other
piece
was
that
he
was
in
middlesboro,
kentucky
and
secondly,
mr.
gibbs
didn't
contend
that.
mr.
gibbs
contended
that
he
conveniently
absented
himself
from
southern
tennessee
and
was
in
middlesboro,
kentucky.
this
is
something
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
--
injected
into
the
case.
now
we
admit
and
also
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
referred
to
the
fact
that
umw
granted
relief
in
the
form
of
groceries
to
some
of
these
people.
i
do
not
understand
how
this
could
be
possibly
be
interpreted
as
that
they
instigated
these
activities
or
responsible
for
any
of
the
picketing
because
they
granted
relief
to
their
members.
i
mean,
some
of
them
participated
in
illegal
activity
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
that
situation,
it's
a
trial
de
novo
because
the
district
court
instructed
the
jury
that
they
could
not
find
that.
so
if
the
jury
relied
upon
this
evidence,
then
it
didn't
follow
the
instructions
of
the
court.
but
we
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
the
local
was
not.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
there's
no
evidence
to
that
except
that
this
meeting
in
which
they
discuss
the
matter.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
in
--
on
sunday.
they
discussed
as
to
whether
or
not
these
mines
are
going
to
be
opened
up.
of
course
once
it
was
found
out
in
this
area
that
these
mines
are
going
to
be
opened
up,
that
just
spreads
like
wildfire.
of
course
there
were
officers
of
the
local
union
at
the
scene
of
these
alleged
activities.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
on
monday
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
--
the
record
doesn't
disclose
where
there's
any
announcement,
some
of
them
would
be
there.
some
of
them
decide
to
go,
two
or
three
of
them
to
find
out
if
the
mines
were
going
to
be
opened.
of
course
they
didn't
know
anything
about
gibbs
or
any
replacements
being
brought
in.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
no
vote.
we
have
--
what
we
contend
that
although
the
secondary
boycott
question
of
the
union
responsibility
maybe
governed
by
the
common
law
of
agency
but
we
contend
that
section
6
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
the
controlling
statute
of
union
responsibility
which
requires
clear
proof
that
the
unlawful
acts
of
an
agent
or
an
officer
or
a
member
of
the
union
was
of
--
actually
authorized
or
participated
in
or
rather
--
were
ratified
after
actual
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
by
the
union.
that
under
this
standard
of
proof,
of
course
there
could
be
no
finding
that
the
union
was
responsible
for
any
of
the
alleged
unlawful
conduct.
that
is
the
international
union.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
right
and
the
court
charged
the
jury
that
and
of
course
we
upon
our
urging.
now,
the
prejudicial
effect
of
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
in
ignoring
section
6
and
deciding
the
question
on
union
responsibility
on
some
theory
of
respondeat
superior
that
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
you
can
award
damages
against
the
principle
on
the
theory
of
respondeat
superior,
but
of
course
we
couldn't
raise
that
in
the
trial
court
because
the
court
said
that
the
union
must
participate
in
it
or
actually
authorize
it
and
we
couldn't
raise
that
point.
and
had
the
jury
been
instructed
the
way
the
sixth
circuit
said
was
the
proper
law
on
the
way
the
jury
could
infer
union
responsibility,
the
court
would
have
had
to
instruct
the
jury
that
you
can't
come
in
with
any
award
of
punitive
damages.
you
can
impute
malice
to
a
principle
in
tennessee,
but
we
are
foreclosed
by
that.
we
got
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
court
--
so
but
we
don't
contend
now
as
far
as
the
taft-hartley
violation
goes
that
section
6
applies
as
gibbs
contends
in
his
brief
before
this
court.
we
admit
that
there's
a
different
standard
when
you
look
at
the
secondary
boycott
aspects
of
it,
but
on
the
state
cause
of
action
here
that
the
court
found,
we
contend
that
section
6
applies.
and
it
must
apply
in
this
case
because
that's
what
the
court
charged
the
jury
and
there
was
no
objection
to
that
by
the
plaintiff
and
there
was
no
question
before
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
that
was
erroneous.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that
is
found
on
--
it's
found,
your
honor,
on
page
509a
of
the
transcript.
it
says
before
that
the
defendant
maybe
held
responsible
for
the
acts
of
its
agents
entering
into
a
conspiracy
during
the
course
of
a
labor
dispute
there
must
be
clear
proof
that
the
particular
conspiracy
charged
for
the
act
generally
of
that
nature
had
been
expressly
authorized
or
necessarily
followed
from
the
granted
authority
by
the
defendant.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
there
was
no
evidence
and
we
--
that
was
what
our
contention
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
that
you
can't
support
this
verdict
because
there
isn't
any
evidence
the
international
union
did
anything.
it
didn't
have
knowledge
of
these
events.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
right
and
there
is
no
proof
of
that.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct
your
honor,
that's
correct.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
let
alone
clear
proof.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
i
think
we
are
actually
by
that.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well,
i
think
there's
the
federal
question
as
to
what
is
the
proper
standard
of
--
to
apply
the
union
responsibility.
what's
happening
in
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
in
violation
of
state
cause
of
action.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
i
don't
think
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
it
wouldn't
if
--
well
in
the
--
if
it
applied
in
the
--
in
the
--
any
court
in
the
united
states
involving
a
labor
dispute,
it
wouldn't
ordinarily
in
a
simple
case
of
assault
and
battery,
but
we
don't
think
that
under
any
standard
of
responsibility
that
they
can
find
this
union
liable
even
under
the
common
law,
law
of
agency.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
we
think
they
should
be
perm
--
go
to
the
jury
under
a
proper
instruction
of
the
court
as
to
what
the
law
reads.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct,
your
honor
but
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
follow
that.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
the
sixth
circuit
gave
it
--
it
couldn't
find
clear
proof
of
that
because
there
wasn't
any
evidence
in
the
record
but
it
applied
a
different
standard
and
i
don't
know
what
standard
actually
it
applied
because
it
said
that
it
went
on
further.
it
painted
union
responsibility
with
even
with
broader
brush.
it
said
even
if
it
didn't
instigate
the
actions
of
the
15th
or
16th
gilbert
did
by
the
subsequent
picketing
even
though
it
ratified
the
actions
of
the
15th
and
16th
because
the
subsequent
picketing
was
more
effective.
i
don't
think
that
satisfies
the
law
of
ratification.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
let
me
then
move
on
to
the
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
fourth
question.
now
the
--
and
the
court
said
it
submitted
an
erroneous
theory
but
it
could
be
support
of
the
other
theory
but
you
can't
tell
what
the
jury
did
and
we
say
that
when
you
do
that
you
must
have
that
support.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
but
i
would
like
to
get
on
this
question
of
preemption
because
we
claimed
by
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
right.
my
personal
opinion
is
that
laburnum
should
be
overruled
but
you
don't
have
to
do
that
to
find
state
preemption
here
because
in
laburnum
and
in
russell,
the
court
says
that
by
congress
enacting
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
did
not
develop
any
federal
compensatory
scheme
for
past
conduct.
and
that
in
the
absence
therefore
clear
congressional
intent,
they
would
not
infer
that
in
this
traditional
field
of
state
action
that
there
was
preemption.
there
was
no
damage.
it's
the
same
thing
that
happened
in
russell
which
involved
an
employee
recovering
damages
under
state
law.
they
said
the
fact
that
the
board
had
discretionary
power
under
section
10
to
award
back
pay,
it
couldn't
award
punitive
damages.
and
in
laburnum
it
was
noted
that
congress
did
these
things
under
section
303
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
you
have
congress
taking
over
the
entire
field
almost
like
a
colossus
if
i
can
borrow
that
phrase
to
provide
a
remedy
for
future
conduct
by
injunctions
in
cease
and
desist
orders
and
it
provided
damages.
and
here
you
have
a
big
conflict,
the
greatest
conflict
you
can
have
because
under
state
law
for
this
conduct,
they
provide
not
only
for
damages
but
for
punitive
damages.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
your
honor,
we
didn't
win
our
303
case.
the
district
court
found
that
gibbs
as
an
independent
trucking
contractor,
there
was
a
violation.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well
there
was
a
violation
and
when
on
though
that
the
violation
under
that
this
unlawful
interference
causing
to
lose
his
job
as
mine
superintendent.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
on
that
part
of
it.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
if
by
unlawful
interference
with
his
contract
has
included
something
else.
he's
a
mine
superintendent
and
they
awarded
punitive
damages
against
this
for
that.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well
i
think
if
they
claim
that
it
was
the
secondary
boycott
or
it's
arguably
so
that
it's
a
secondary
boycott,
yes.
i
don't
think
state
law
applies.
you
find
in
the
garmon
and
in
garner
and
all
of
that
which
has
a
broader
aspect
of
conflict.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct
so
that
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well
i
think
if
you
find
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that
that
was
a
primary
strike
and
therefore
if
that's
so,
then
there
is
preemption
under
section
7
or
it
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
not
if
they're
violent?
well,
if
they
brought
a
--
an
action
for
a
primary
violent
primary
case,
and
if
laburnum
is
still
good,
let's
assume
that
it
is,
then
of
course
you
run
into
the
question
of
pendent
jurisdiction
and
that's
the
next
question
that
we
haven't
got
into.
that
is
into
another
field.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
by
then,
we
also
have
here
an
award
of
punitive
damages
which
is
in
direct
conflict
with
it.
we
also
claim
that
there
is
preemption
by
the
fact
that
the
sixth
circuit
what
it
did
here
was
the
regulation
of
peaceful
picketing
that
under
the
garmon
rule.
that
by
the
action
of
finding
liability
for
the
peaceful
conduct
substantive
to
the
sixteenth
there
was
preemption
led
that
that
constitutes
regulation
of
peaceful
future
conduct.
it
also
violates
the
rule
of
the
totality
of
effort
rule
that
this
court
denounced
in
morton
whereas
there
was
award
of
damages
for
prime
--
peaceful
primary
activity
here
which
they
claimed
was
in
violation
of
the
state
law.
let
me
now
get
to
the
question
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
we
claim
that
there
was
no
pendent
jurisdiction
in
this
case
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place
we
claim
that
the
question
of
a
secondary
boycott
as
to
gibbs
was
plainly
unsubstantiated
because
here
was
solely
a
primary
dispute
with
the
grundy
mining
company
over
a
new
contract
or
over
the
employment.
there
was
no
secondary
--
no
dispute
with
gibbs
other
than
his
representation
of
grundy
as
mine
superintendent
as
their
agent.
and
the
court
ignored
the
fact
that
there
has
to
be
a
primary
dispute
and
a
secondary
dispute
as
this
court
has
spelled
out
many
times.
there
was
no
dispute
with
mr.
gibbs
as
a
trucking
contractor.
his
trucks
were
under
contract
and
they
continued
to
operate
during
this
period
of
time.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well
i
guess
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no
i
don't
think
even
as
he
--
as
he
made
this
pleading.
he
didn't
really
plead
any
dispute
with
gibbs
a
primary
dispute
with
gibbs.
he
plead
one
that
there
is
really
an
interference
with
his
job
over
there
by
violence
and
so
forth.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well
if
you
have
a
federal
claim
that
is
arguably
within
or
cases
arguably
within
the
federal
law,
then
you
have
preemption.
if
you
--
if
it's
not
arguable
then,
then
it's
plainly
as
substantial
and
you
don't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
then
we
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
and
if
that's
correct,
and
then
it
should
be
decided
upon
303
and
not
the
state
cause
of
action
and
in
that
way
permits
--
does
not
permit
this
court
to
award
punitive
damages.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well
actually
there
was
no
pleading
that
there
was
any
dispute
with
gibbs
as
a
trucker.
he
just
claimed
this
is
part
of
damage
under
his
contract
and
there
was
no
primary
dispute
with
gibbs.
there
was
only
one
dispute
in
this
case.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
yes
if
he
had
plead
that
there
was
a
dispute
with
him
as
a
trucking
contractor
and
the
umw
then
had
matched
the
grundy
mining
company
with
it,
then
you
would
have
a
secondary
boycott
or
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
i
think
that
what
they
held
below
is
the
primary
dispute
with
gibbs
because
they
had
the
capacity.
i
don't
know
what
the
court
meant
of
being
any
other
person.
there
was
no
actually
any
cause
of
action
based
upon
that.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
as
the
district
judge
understood
it.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well
if
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
because
i
think
if
there
was
a
--
if
the
question
was
not
plainly
unsubstantial,
and
if
there
was
only
one
cause
of
action
which
is
the
next
point
--
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
that's
right.
they
found
that
it
wasn't
but
we've
also
claim
that
this
is
not
--
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
because
there
was
in
effect
two
causes
of
action.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
no,
i
think
it's
based
upon
a
different
violation
of
a
different
right.
he
claimed
a
violation
of
his
right
under
federal
law
which
is
right
to
be
free
from
the
secondary
pressure
but
this
right
under
state
law
was
to
be
free
from
the
interference
with
his
contract
as
mine
superintendent.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
we
think
in
effect
though
that
there
were
two
separate
causes
of
action.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
well
i
think
it's
under
--
and
of
course
if
it
was
under
federal
law,
then
there
is
preemption.
if
it
wasn't,
then
there
wasn't
--
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
case.
you
--
it's
different.
the
court
found
under
the
--
using
the
soule
case
which
was
a
question
of
state
regulation
of
intrastate
railroads
and
under
state
statute.
and
they
raised
a
federal
question
which
with
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute.
they
said,
there
was
constitutional
went
ahead
and
decided
that
the
case
under
merits
and
under
the
state
statute
but
that's
an
entirely
different
thing
here.
i
think
that
the
facts
supporting
his
interference
of
--
with
his
contract
as
mine
superintendent
is
different
than
the
facts
of
--
his
interference,
his
right
to
operate
as
an
independent
trucking
contractor
free
from
secondary
pressure
from
grundy.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
on
the
question
of
the
liability
of
a
principle,
the
respondent
punitive
damages
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
court
to
the
case
of
early
versus
roadway
express
which
106
federal
sup
page
938,
that's
not
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
willard
p.
owens
it's
106
federal
sup
938,
and
under
tennessee
law,
the
fact
that
they
--
an
agent
enters
into
a
conspiracy
does
not
make
the
principle
liable
in
punitive
damages
that
the
principle
must
do
the
act
of
youth
because
on
the
theory
that
as
many
states
have
which
you
can
impute
malice
to
the
principle.
some
states
don't
have
that
rule.
tennessee
is
one
of
them.
