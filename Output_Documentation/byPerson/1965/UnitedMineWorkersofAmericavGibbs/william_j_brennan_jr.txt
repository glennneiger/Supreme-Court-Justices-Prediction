so
we
do

you
go
beyond
that
[inaudible]
justice

[inaudible]
justice
william
j.

[inaudible]
enactment
of
the
federal
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
the
norris-laguardia
act
deals
with
limitations
upon
federal
court
jurisdiction,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
is
section
6
any
less
applicable
in
the
conduct
of
a
federal
lawsuit
than
section
4.
i
had
viewed
of
this
in
sinclair
on
the
injunction
side
but
i
lost
out
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
section
6
apply
to
the
governing
and
then
an
action
which
was
only
a
303
action
where
you
bring
it
against
the
--
on
the
theory
of
ratification
of
section
6
govern
that
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wouldn't
apply
to
303.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
that
why
does
it
apply
where
you're
resting
here
on
pendent
jurisdiction,
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
said
why
doesn't
--
why
is
it
that
it
would
apply
if
these
were
only
a
303
action
on
the
issue
of
ratification?
why
doesn't
it
apply
where
you're
only
in
the
federal
court
on
pendent
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
would
not
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry
i
thought
you
said
you
thought
it
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
means
it
follows
that
it
would
not
apply
in
the
303
action,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
it
not
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
what
about
the
other
page
of
that
argument
if
you're
right
that
section
6
doesn't
apply,
how
about
the
argument
that
nevertheless
there's
no
evidence
here
to
support
as
i
understand
your
adversary
a
finding
of
participation
by
the
international?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
only
thing
i
see
in
this
brief
is
that
limited
to
that
testimony
of
mr.
gibbs
that
he
was
thinking,
he
saw
mr.
gilbert
around
but
he
didn't
know
where
he
went,
is
that
all
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
my
question
is,
is
that
all
there
is
that
--
well
everything
happens
so
fast
there.
i'm
thinking
that
i've
seen
mr.
gilbert
drive
up
there
but
where
he
went
i
don't
know.
is
that
all
there
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
is
the
--
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
that's
challenged,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
after
the
sixteenth,
was
there
any
violence,
i
know
you
said
that
there's
other
evidence
of
violence
after
the
sixteenth,
but
was
there
any
evidence
of
other
violence
on
the
picket
line
itself
after
he
took
over?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
mr.
gilbert.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
but
is
there
any
connection
of
all
these
incidents
with
the
picketing
of
the
grundy
mine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
that
wasn't
enough
apparently
to
sustain
your
303
claim,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
was
the
go
to
on
your
state
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
why
would
it
be
anymore
sufficient
to
support
your
state
claiming
that
regard
then
the
support
your
303
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
it
was
sufficient
for
the
state
claim
if
not
for
the
303.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
you
contend
that
it
goes
anyway
to
the
issue
of
ratification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
walker
could
you
say
there
was
other
testimony
that
put
mr.
gilbert
nearby
besides
this
with
gibbs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
