mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit,
raises
an
unsettled
question
of
federal
jurisdiction.
how
are
the
district
courts
to
determine,
whether
diversity
of
citizenship
exists,
when
one
of
the
parties
to
the
case
is
a
labor
union.
now
this
case
was
instituted
in
the
state
courts
of
north
carolina,
the
county
court
of
mecklenburg
county.
the
respondent
here,
the
company
filed
a
complaint
against
the
union,
alleging
that
it
had
been
libel
by
a
pamphlet
distributed
by
the
union.
it
sought
as
damages
$100,000
actual
damages
and
$100,000
punitive
damages.
the
only
parties
to
the
action
were
the
company
which
was
the
plaintiff
and
the
union
which
was
the
defendant.
the
union
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court,
alleging
the
diversity
of
citizenship
existed.
it
asserted
in
its
removal
papers
that
the
plaintiff
company
was
a
citizen
of
north
carolina,
because
incorporated
there
and
having
its
principal
place
of
business
there,
and
that
the
defendant
union
was
a
citizen
of
pennsylvania,
because
they
were
not
incorporated
that
was
the
state
of
its
principal
place
of
business.
the
company
moved
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
state
court.
it
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
citizen
of
north
carolina.
it
did
not
dispute
the
union's
contention
that
pennsylvania
was
its
principal
place
of
business.
but
it
asserted
that
notwithstanding
those
facts
diversity
of
citizenship
did
not
exist
because
it
said
a
union
has
no
citizenship
for
diversity
purposes,
and
that
the
courts
must
treat
it
when
it's
a
party,
as
though
it
were
a
citizen
of
every
state
in
which
it
has
a
member.
since
this
union,
the
united
steelworkers
has
a
member
in
each
of
the
50
states,
including
of
course
north
carolina,
this
meant
on
the
company's
theory
that
no
diversity
of
citizenship
existed.
the
district
judge
refused
to
remand
the
case.
he
held
as
the
union
had
urged
that
it
was
a
citizen
of
its
principal
place
of
business,
pennsylvania
and
that
this
was
therefore
a
suit
between
a
north
carolina
plaintiff
and
a
pennsylvania
defendant.
the
company
sought
and
obtained
interlocutory
review
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
as
the
company
urged,
that
a
union
has
no
citizenship
of
its
own
and
that
the
district
court
must
look
to
the
citizenship
of
each
of
its
members
and
that
therefore
a
union
such
as
this
one
with
members
in
each
of
the
50
states,
is
to
be
treated
as
though
it
were
a
citizen
of
each
of
the
50
states
and
therefore
incapable
of
removing
cases
to
the
federal
courts
on
the
ground
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
question
before
this
court
therefore,
is
whether
labor
union
shall
be
treated
as
corporations
have
since
1844,
as
having
a
citizenship
distinct
from
that
of
their
members
or
in
the
corporate
case
their
shareholders,
or
whether
they
are
to
have
as
the
court
below
held
no
citizenship
and
therefore
be
deemed
citizens
of
every
state
in
which
they
have
a
member.
now
of
course
the
governing
standard
is
article
iii,
section
2,
of
the
constitution
which
creates
the
diversity
ground
and
28
u.s.c.,
section
1332
(a),
which
confers
that
grant
upon
the
lower
district
courts
and
both
speak
in
identical
words.
the
constitution
provides
that
the
judicial
power,
the
federal
judicial
power,
shall
extend
to
controversies
between
citizens
of
different
states
and
the
statute
provides
that
the
district
courts
shall
have
original
jurisdiction.
of
all
civil
actions
where
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
value
of
$10,000
as
it
does
here,
and
is
between,
in
the
words
of
the
constitution,
citizens
of
different
states.
the
question
therefore
is
whether
under
these
provisions
the
union
like
the
corporation
is
a
citizen,
and
in
our
view
the
beginning
of
that
inquiry
is
to
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction,
and
to
see
whether
it
applies
to
unions
as
to
corporations,
so
as
to
warrant
their
being
treated
as
a
single
entity.
now
there
have
been
historically
great
debates
about
what
the
purpose
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction
is,
and
what
it
was
when
it
was
originally
conferred.
but
from
the
time
of
alexander
hamilton's
statements
in
federalist
number
80,
down
through
the
legislative
history
of
the
congressional
amendments
in
1958,
one
overriding
purpose
has
been
consistently
expressed
and
we
think
must
be
accepted
as
the
governing
justification
for
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
that
purpose
is
that
a
neutral
forum,
a
federal
forum
be
provided,
when
an
outsider
is
forced
to
litigate
in
the
courts
of
its
adversary
or
in
the
geographic
region
of
his
adversary.
the
theory
was
as
alexander
hamilton
put
it
in
the
federalist,
that
in
such
cases
the
state
tribunals
cannot
be
supposed
to
be
impartial.
and
as
concluded
by
the
judicial
conference
in
the
1950's
and
adopted
in
the
congressional
reports
in
1958,
there
is
a
great
bulk
of
expert
opinion
from
those
who
litigate
in
the
courts,
that
local
prejudice
continues
to
exist
and
that
the
federal
courts
are
in
truth
a
strong
protection
against
it.
now,
we
submit
that
the
labor
union
today
going
into
those
states
where
it
is
not
principally
found,
is
subjected
to
and
receives
as
much
local
prejudice
as
does
a
corporation,
which
though
present
in
that
state
is
not
principally
found
there.
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
diversity
grant
under
the
statutory
conferral
of
that
grant
is
equally
applicable
to
the
union,
as
to
the
corporation.
to
demonstrate
that
indeed
we
do
encounter
local
prejudice
we
have
appended
to
our
brief
just
a
few
leaflets
which
were
introduced
at
one
congressional
hearing,
to
show
the
kinds
of
local
appeals
which
are
made
to
persuade
people
to
reject
unions,
when
they
are
running
labor
board
elections.
now,
these
were
submitted
by
one
union
and
they
refer
to
one
area
of
the
country.
that
these
leaflets
are
encountered
by
unions
and
these
appeals
to
local
prejudice
are
encountered
by
unions,
all
unions
not
just
this
one,
in
many
sections
of
the
country,
indeed
in
all
of
those
where
they
are
not
--
what
might
be
described
as
the
non-industrial
states,
those
where
the
unions
are
not
commonly
found
and
principally
found
and
very
much
at
home.
and
the
common
theme
of
all
of
these
leaflets
is
that
the
union
is
the
outsider,
don't
let
this
outsider
into
our
community,
let's
not
bring
this
outsider
into
our
community
and
they
reflect
what
really
is
today
an
economic
conflict
between
the
states.
we
have
today
a
great
battle
to
attract
industry
between
the
states.
we
have
some
states
trying
to
keep
it
and
others
trying
to
attract
it
and
all
of
them
very
busily
engaged
in
what
is
this
form
of
economic
competition.
and
some
of
those
states
have
sought
industry
and
advertised
for
it,
on
the
ground
that
labor
standards
are
a
less
expensive
here
and
that
this
is
an
attraction,
which
you
should
look
at
when
deciding
to
come
here.
as
a
result
of
this
conflict
people
in
those
states
which
are
seeking
business
on
this
basis
are
constantly
urged,
as
they
are
in
some
of
these
leaflets
and
editorial,
constantly
urged
to
reject
the
unions,
let's
not
let
them
in
here,
because
once
they
come
in
this
great
argument
that
we
have
to
attract
business
to
this
region
will
disappear.
so
that
when
a
union
is
sued
in
the
state
courts
of
such
a
state,
where
such
appeals
have
been
made,
and
where
such
local
prejudice
against
them
does
indeed
exist,
it
faces
a
mighty
burden
and
a
mighty
danger.
in
this
case
for
example,
a
prominent
local
corporation
is
seeking
damages
to
the
tune
of
$200,000
against
a
union
which
has
come
to
that
state
and
sought
to
organize
its
employees.
now,
to
be
sure
this
union
does
have
a
few
more
members
in
that
state,
they
constitute
less,
considerably
less
than
one-tenth
of
1%
of
its
membership,
but
there
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
has
--
,
well
this
union,
the
steelworkers
sets
up
a
local
whenever
it
organizes
a
plant.
it
has,
i
understand
a
couple
of
plants
in
north
carolina
and
therefore
couple
of
locals.
it
had
no
local
at
the
situs
of
this
plant,
because
it
doesn't
create
one
until
after
it's
organized
the
employees
and
they've
elected
it
and
of
course
in
this
case
as
it
happened,
the
union
was
not
elected,
so
no
local
was
ever
created.
but
it
does
have
a
couple
of
locals
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
it
may
be
that
even
on
their
theory
those
locals
which
are
independent
entities,
independent
legal
entities,
might
be
citizens
of
north
carolina.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pardon
me.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
they
may
well
be
on
our
theory,
but
of
course
they
are
not
sued
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no
one
is
seeking
that
they
pay
the
liability
which
might
be
awarded
in
this
case,
the
international
is
sued
here.
and
the
jury
will
well
know
that
if
it
awards
a
verdict
of
$200,000
it
is
not
going
to
be
paid
by
our
few
members
there
nor
by
these
locals
who
are
not
parties,
but
it's
going
to
be
paid
from
the
treasury
of
this
union,
which
is
in
a
bank
in
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
we
think
and
i
hope
that
will
develop
in
my
argument,
that
the
standard
which
ought
to
be
used
in
determining,
whether
an
unincorporated
association
is
a
citizen,
is
not
a
broad
one
which
says
that
every
unincorporated
association
is
a
citizen,
but
one
which
looks
to
the
legal
characteristics
of
the
association
to
determine
whether
in
fact
it
is
so
viewed
as
an
entity
distinct
from
it's
members,
that
it
is
likely
to
be
subjected
to
the
prejudice
of
an
entity
or
whether
in
fact
it
is
primarily
a
loose
group
of
people
associated
together
which
perhaps
has
a
few
characteristics
of
a
legal
entity,
but
not
very
many.
we
think
indeed
that
this
court
has
already
said
that
in
puerto
rico
versus
russell
which
i'll
come
to.
now
it
may
well
be
that
in
the
common
partnership
the
two
men
who
bound
together,
the
characteristics
of
legal
entity,
which
have
been
assigned
to
that
partnership,
are
considerably
less,
indeed
i
am
sure
they
are,
then
that
which
is
assigned
to
the
labor
union
today.
for
many
more
purposes
the
partnership
is
not
an
entity
but
two
men
joined
together,
who
are
treated
as
two
individuals
for
numerous
purposes
in
the
law.
for
many
less
purposes
as
i'll
show
is
a
labor
union
so
treated
as
a
group
of
members.
indeed
it
is
now
i
think
safely
to
be
said
treated
as
much
an
entity
as
is
a
corporation
and
we
will
show
this
i
hope
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
now
to
be
sure
we
have
spelled
out
the
prejudice
which
we,
the
labor
union
fear,
the
local
prejudice
which
we
fear
in
certain
states,
but
this
is
not
a
one
sided
matter.
there
are
those
who
must
sue
the
union
where
it
can
be
found
in
its
states,
who
feel
that
in
such
states
they
are
the
outsider
and
it's
they
who
want
the
protection
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
indeed
this
is
i
think
the
first
case
ever
to
reach
an
appellate
court
in
which
it's
been
the
labor
union
asserting
that
diversity
exists.
there
have
been
only
a
few
cases
in
the
appellate
court
that
those
that
have
gotten
there
with
the
exception
of
this
one,
have
been
cases
when
the
labor
union
is
adversary
in
the
proceeding,
usually
an
individuals,
sometimes
a
corporation,
is
alleging
and
asserting
that
diversity
exists
and
that
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
federal
courts.
this
is
very
much
as
is
i
suppose
every
diversity
consideration
a
two-way
street.
you
are
an
outsider
somewhere
and
you
are
insider
somewhere
and
whichever
side
you
are
on,
someone
would
like
to
be
in
federal
courts
for
its
protections,
where
indeed
you
have
citizens
of
different
states.
now
the
plaintiff,
the
person
who
wishes
to
sue
the
union
has
gotten
rather
sympathetic
treatment
from
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
including
the
court
below.
they
recognize,
indeed
they
say
it
would
be
a
failure
of
justice
if
one
could
not
bring
the
labor
union
into
the
federal
courts
on
diversity
grounds
and
they
have
therefore
approved
the
procedure
of
suing
union
in
a
class
action,
not
naming
the
union,
but
naming
certain
representatives
of
the
union
as
the
defendants,
being
careful
to
select
only
representatives
who's
citizenship
is
distinct
from
the
plaintiffs.
and
then
under
the
prevailing
doctrines
of
this
court,
since
you
look
only
to
the
representatives
of
the
class
to
determine
diversity,
then
finding
that
there
is
here
diversity
of
jurisdiction
because
the
plaintiff
is
a
citizen
of
state
a
and
the
particular
of
representatives
of
the
labor
union
named
are
not
citizens
of
state
a.
and
they
have
said
that
this
procedure
allowing
this
class
action
was
essential
to
bring
the
labor
unions
into
the
federal
courts
on
diversity
grounds
and
essential
to
prevent
the
failure
of
justice.
we
submit
however
that
while
that
decision
and
the
desire
to
bring
the
federal
court
--
the
labor
unions
into
the
federal
courts
as
defendants
is
entire
sound.
that
it's
grossly
unfair
to
say
that
the
labor
union
likewise
doesn't
have
the
opportunity
to
remove
it's
case
to
the
federal
courts
on
diversity
grounds,
because
the
consequence
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
given
the
absolute
option.
this
north
carolina
citizen
who
wants
to
sue
what
really
is
a
pennsylvania
corporation
can
choose
which
court
we
will
be
in,
if
it
wants
to
sue
us
in
federal
court
it
sue
as
a
class
and
it
will
have
diversity
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
below.
but
if
it
wants
to
prevent
us
access
to
the
federal
courts,
it
may
only
sue
us
in
our
common
name
as
an
entity
and
under
the
decision
of
the
court
below
we
are
forbidden
to
remove
this
case
to
the
federal
court.
this
we
think
a
far
greater
of
failure
of
justice
than
one
which
would
keep
both
parties
out
of
the
federal
court.
and
so
we
submit
that
if
this
question
were
one
of
first
impression
and
for
reasons
which
i'll
get
into,
we
don't
think
it
is,
that
looking
to
the
purpose
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction,
looking
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
since
1844
concluded
that,
that
purpose
warrants
treating
a
corporation
as
a
citizen,
that
likewise
a
labor
union
should
be
treated
as
a
citizen
for
diversity
purposes.
but
we
think
it's
not
a
case
of
first
impression.
indeed,
we
think
this
case
is
governed
by
this
court's
decision
in
1933,
in
puerto
rico
versus
russell.
we've
said
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
puerto
rico
versus
russell.
it
appears
at
pages
22
through
25
of
our
brief,
which
is
the
light
gray
brief
and
in
that
case
the
court
had
before
it
an
unincorporated
association
entitled
“sociedad
en
comandita,”
a
puerto
rican
unincorporated
association
and
the
question
was,
was
it
a
citizen
of
puerto
rico,
which
is
where
it
was
chartered
and
setup
or
was
it
as
the
sociedad
contended
not
a
citizen
of
puerto
rico
because
all
of
its
members
were
citizens
of
another
state.
and
the
supreme
court
first
took
a
broad
look
at
its
decisions
dealing
with
corporations
and
it
said,
we
have
said
that
a
corporation
is
a
citizen
or
treated
as
a
citizen,
not
because
of
any
magic
surrounding
the
act
of
incorporation,
but
because
the
corporation
is
a
complete
legal
personality,
is
endowed
with
a
complete
legal
personality
and
therefore
it
is
convenient
to
treat
it
so
as
a
legal
personality
for
purposes
of
diversity
jurisdiction
as
well.
and
it
said
the
question
we
must
decide
with
respect
to
this
unincorporated
association
is
whether
it
too
has
been
endowed
with
a
complete
legal
personality
for
other
purposes.
such
that
it
can
be
conveniently
treated
as
such
a
legal
personality
for
diversity
--
for
citizenship
purposes
as
well.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
prevailing
rule,
as
i
understand
it
and
there
is
first
circuit
decision
which
had
some
trouble
with
this,
but
the
prevailing
rule
is
that
if
you
sue
these
representatives
in
their
capacity
as
representatives
of
the
class,
normally
some
sort
of
officer
or
and
it's
not
just
any
member,
you've
got
to
find
someone
who
has
some
sort
of
representative.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right
as
representing
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
as
representing
the
class
which
consists
of
all
the
members
of
the
union.
the
prevailing
rule
and
it's
not
the
exclusive
rule,
is
that
you
can
collect
your
judgment
out
of
the
union's
treasury.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
obtains
in
those
decisions
which
have
held,
that
they
are
cited
in
our
case
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
is
a
first
circuit
case
which
has
held
expressly
to
contrary,
and
said
that
if
you
sue
the
representatives
as
representatives
of
the
class,
you
can
only
collect
from
each
of
the
members
of
the
union
individually,
but
not
from
the
treasury
of
the
union
which
in
our
judgment
would
be
far
worse
result.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
on
behalf
of
the
union
as
an
entity?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
not
aware
of
any
of
the
purpose
in
which
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
it
would.
as
a
practical
matter
it
never
arises
though,
because
it's
just
--
a
peculiarity
since
federal
law
governs
so
much
of
the
conduct
of
a
labor
union,
virtually
any
suit
which
a
labor
union
would
want
to
bring
is
one
which
is
not
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
assuming
that
the
states
are
now
holding
that
a
labor
union
can
be
libel
as
an
entity.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes
i
suppose
that
under
these
decisions
the
representatives
of
the
union
could
bring
such
a
class
action.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pardon
me?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
in
a
federal
court
alleging
diversity
and
if
the
decision
of
the
court
below
on
that
question,
the
representative
question
is
correct,
then
they
could
create
diversity
jurisdiction
in
that
manner.
the
much
more
common
case
however
is
when
the
union
is
the
defendant,
in
that
very
narrow
area
of
cases
which
are
not
governed
by
federal
law,
because
of
course
to
the
extent
that
unions
activities
are
governed
by
federal
law,
the
removal
of
law
on
federal
question
ground
and
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
held
that
he
could
not
collect
from
the
entity's
class.
it's
a
first
circuit
case
and
it's
not
cited
in
our
brief,
i
don't
recall
whether
it's
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
or
not.
but
it
is
--
and
i'm
afraid
it's
not
and
i
don't
recall
the
name
of
hand,
but
we
would
if
the
court
desires.
it's
i
believe
oscuel
versus
someone
and
we
would
if
the
court
desires
submit
the
name
of
the
case
after
the
argument.
predominantly
however
the
labor
union's
activities
are
governed
by
federal
law
and
are
removable
on
federal
question
grounds.
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
narrow
area.
we
are
dealing
with
the
area
which
is
neither
contract
actions,
they
are
covered
by
301
or
internal
matters,
which
are
governed
by
landrum-griffin,
nor
preempted
matters.
we
are
dealing
in
other
words
with
violent
torts
and
possibly
with
libel
actions
because
this
court
is
to
sit
this
term
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
are
preempted
and
in
this
narrow
area
the
union
is
rarely
the
plaintiff,
you
can't
be
--
a
union
can
hardly
be
injured
by
a
violent
tort
as
an
entity.
it's
almost
always
the
defendant.
this
is
the
area
where
the
removal
question
is
going
to
be
raised.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
language
of
the
statute
is
28
u.s.c.
section
1332(a).
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
subsection
(1)
which
says
that
there
is
jurisdiction
when
the
controversy
is
between
one,
citizens
of
different
states.
this
is
at
page
two
of
our
brief.
those
are
of
course
the
same
words
which
appear
in
the
constitution.
now
we
believe
that
what
the
supreme
court
said
in
1933
in
russell
is
that
when
an
entity
has
acquired
all
of
the
characteristics
of
legal
personality
as
a
corporation
has,
it
is
entitled
like
a
corporation
to
be
treated
as
a
citizen
for
the
purposes
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
that
we
think
is
the
governing
case
here
because
as
we've
set
out
in
our
brief,
pages
32
through
35,
the
labor
union
today
is
for
all
virtually
all
purposes
the
same
legal
entity
that
a
corporation
is,
it's
far
more
a
legal
entity
than
the
sociedad
involved
in
the
puerto
rico
versus
russell
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
puerto
rico
versus
russell
arose
under
the
organic
act
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
not
under
the
diversity
statute
as
such,
but
the
organic
act
provides
that
there
will
be
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
court
if
either
of
the
parties
to
the
action
is
not
a
citizen
of
puerto
rico.
and
there
was
the
other
--
pardon?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
believe
it
says
not
a
citizen
of
puerto
rico
domiciled
in
that
state
are
the
exact
words.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
says
when
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
where
all
of
the
parties
on
either
side
of
the
controversy
are
citizens
of
a
foreign
state
or
states,
or
citizens
of
a
state
territory,
district
of
the
united
states
and
not
domiciled
in
puerto
rico.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
read
the
decision
to
say
that.
if
you
read
the
puerto
rico
versus
russell
decision,
the
court
from
the
beginning
to
end
says
the
question
we
have
before
us
is
whether
for
the
purposes
of
federal
jurisdiction
this
sociedad
shall
be
treated
like
a
corporation
as
a
citizen
for
purposes
of
federal
jurisdiction.
and
what
the
court
does
is
to
analyze
and
exclusively
those
cases
in
which
it
has
dealt
with
the
question
of
diversity
of
citizenship
and
it's
entire
analysis
and
it's
entire
rationale
is
structured
on
a
comparison
of
the
sociedad
to
a
corporation
in
light
of
its
decisions
according
citizenship
to
a
corporation
for
diversity
purposes.
now
we
don't
deny
that
this
was
not
a
diversity
case,
but
the
decision
of
the
court
reflects
the
court's
judgment.
you
cannot
read
it
i
think
and
come
to
another
conclusion,
that
if
an
unincorporated
association
has
the
same
legal
characteristics
as
a
corporation,
it
should
be
treated
the
same
for
the
purpose
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
of
all
kinds
of
federal
jurisdiction,
including
diversity
jurisdiction.
now
one
more
thing
i'd
like
to
point
to,
corporation
is
not
a
citizen
for
all
purposes
under
the
constitution.
that
word
appears
in
a
number
of
places.
corporation
is
not
a
citizen
for
the
purpose
of
privileges
and
immunities,
it
has
been
held
such.
it
is
a
citizen
for
the
purposes
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
likewise
it
is
not
a
person
for
some
purposes,
but
it
is
for
others
and
the
case
we
would
like
to
call
to
your
honor's
attention
which
appears
at
pages
34
and
35
of
our
brief,
is
united
states
versus
white.
that
involved
the
question
is
a
labor
union
entitled
to
treatment
as
a
person
with
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
the
court
had
already
found
that
a
corporation
is
not
and
the
question
was
is
the
decision
with
respect
to
corporations
equally
applicable
to
labor
unions
and
what
the
supreme
court
said
was
we've
looked
to
the
purpose
of
this
constitutional
clause,
we've
already
said
that
it
is
not
applicable
to
corporations
and
we
find
that
labor
unions
are
so
much
like
corporations
today
that
the
same
purpose
and
the
same
justifications
require
that
they
be
treated
the
same
way.
since
a
corporation
does
not
have
the
privilege
neither
does
a
labor
union.
we
submit
that
here
in
russell
the
reverse
is
true,
since
the
court
--
russell
in
this
case,
since
the
corporation
is
a
citizen
for
a
diversity
purposes,
so
should
be
the
labor
union,
which
is
precisely
like
it
in
all
legal
respects
and
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
devote
the
reminder
of
my
time
to
two
points
raised
by
counsel
for
respondent.
the
first
is
as
to
the
entity
status
of
a
union
vis-a-via
a
corporation
and
specifically
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question.
a
labor
union
now
to
our
knowledge
is
suiable
as
an
entity
virtually
in
every
state
of
the
union.
in
the
last
ten
years
the
state
courts
by
statute
and
by
modification
of
their
common
law
have
made
a
union
an
entity
not
only
in
that
respect,
but
they
have
made
a
union
such
an
entity
that
it
may
sue
for
libel
of
the
entity
as
such,
something
which
was
not
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
it
marches
on
because
the
union
has
become
an
entity
and
recognized
as
such.
and
the
clearest
indication
of
this
is
the
landrum-griffin
act
in
1959,
which
really
is
a
corporate
charter
for
labor
unions.
you've
got
to
have
a
constitution
and
bylaws,
you
must
file
in
as
public
records.
you
must
have
elections
at
periodic
times.
you
must
not
have
certain
kinds
of
trusteeship
and
so
on.
the
entire
structure
of
a
union
is
regulated
precisely
as
is
a
corporation
and
congress
said
that
the
reason
for
that
was,
it
said
in
the
legislative
report,
that
unions
have
now
become
like
corporations
to
be
entities
distinct
from
their
members
and
must
be
regulated
as
such.
so
we
think
insofar
as
the
entity
question
is
concerned,
the
union
is
like
the
corporation
an
entity.
more
on
that
mr.
grier
said
that
the
problem
will
be
in
every
case
you'll
have
to
try
the
facts
of
the
labor
union's
entity.
but
these
are
not
questions
of
fact,
but
of
law.
the
law
makes
the
labor
union
an
entity.
federal
law
primarily
landrum-
griffin
and
so
on
and
virtually
unanimous
state
law
as
a
result
to
these
amendments
over
the
last
ten
years.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
reach
is
the
suggestion
let's
leave
it
to
congress.
a
very
appealing
suggestion
i
suppose,
although
the
court
has
to
decide
the
case
one
way
or
another,
in
whichever
way
it
decides
it
of
course
it
will
ultimately
do
what
the
congress
which
has
the
right
to
amend
this
court's
decisions
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
but
we
suggest
that
congress
has
already
exercised
the
full
scope
of
it's
constitutional
jurisdiction,
for
it
has
written
a
diversity
section
of
the
statute
in
precisely
the
words
of
the
constitution.
if,
and
this
has
been
true
in
1875
congress
almost
wrote
the
constitution
into
the
statute,
not
only
for
diversity
grounds,
but
for
all
jurisdictional
ground.
it
has
then
over
the
years
written
exceptions
in
to
be
sure
there
is
a
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount,
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions.
there
is
non
saying
labor
unions
are
not
to
be
treated
as
citizens,
and
so
we
have
a
statute
in
the
words
of
the
constitution
saying
there
is
jurisdiction
between
citizens
of
different
states.
if
congress
has
the
constitutional
power
to
allow
a
labor
union
to
remove
the
case
on
diversity
grounds,
then
presumably
it
has
done
so
by
writing
the
statute
in
the
words
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow.
congress
could
use
the
constitutional
words
and
intend
to
mean
something
less,
but
the
history
of
1875
act
is
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that's
right
it
may
not
be
constitutional
to
make
a
labor
union
a
citizen,
but
if
it
is
constitutional
we
say
congress
has
already
done
it.
so
it
maybe
unconstitutional,
but
if
it's
constitutional,
it
cannot
be
left
to
congress
because
congress
has
done
it
already,
that
is
our
point.
