[inaudible]
if
the
union
â€“
you
know
if
a
plaintiff
picks
out
a
couple
of
union
members
and
sues
them
a
as
--
in
a
class
action
in
the
federal
court
as
you
suggested
could
be
done
and
judgment
is
obtained
against
the
--
to
--
from
whom
can
you
collect
the
judgment?
let's
not
say
whether
the
union
would
paid
it
or
not,
but
who
could
you
force
to
pay
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
kind
of
class
--
you
mean
as
representative
--
you
are
suing
him
as
representing
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
representing
class
of
individuals?
justice
byron
r.
white
out
of
the
union
treasury?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
rule
obtain?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
citations
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
converse?
can
--
do
you
of
any
cases
in
which
individual
union
members
have
sued
as
--
brought
a
class
action
against
somebody
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
on
behalf
of
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
be
as
permissible
as
being
sued
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
wanted
to
bring
the
libel
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
we
just
may
--
we
might
have
trouble
questioning
your
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
one
labor
union
might
be
different
than
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
would
that
do
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
whether
it's
a
matter
of
structuring
diversity
jurisdiction
the
union
would
or
wouldn't
be
within
that
exception
nevertheless
the
ali
recommendation
is
that
the
union
be
treated
as
an
entity
and
as
a
citizen
and
it's
just
that
some
citizen
may
have
some
activities
in
the
state
which
may
borrow
from
the
federal
court,
but
on
the
issue
we're
talking
about
the
ali
seems
to
have
gone
along
the
russell
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
are
just
saying
--
all
your
are
saying
is
they
get
at
it
in
a
different
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
arrive
at
the
result
of
the
union
being
as
a
--
qualified
to
be
in
court
as
an
entity.
