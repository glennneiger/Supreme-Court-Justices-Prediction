mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
on
this
appeal
the
union
is
faced
is
with
an
adverse
opinion
on
the
law,
an
experienced
circuit
court
composed
of
chief
justice
sobeloff
and
circuit
judges
bowman
and
bail.
a
record
which
does
not
contain
the
proof
that
would
be
required
for
the
union's
standard
and
by
actual
facts
which
would
show
that
the
union
has
a
greater
political
strength
in
the
area,
does
then
does
--
then
does
respondent
bouligny.
in
the
oral
argument
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
try
to
make
these
five
points.
one,
the
record
does
not
establish
the
facts
required
for
diversity
jurisdiction,
applying
the
test
suggested
by
the
union.
second
when
the
action
was
filed,
the
law
was
clear
that
the
union
had
no
right
to
remove
from
the
state
to
the
federal
court
on
the
grounds
of
diversity.
third
the
existing
law
as
established
by
this
court,
has
the
advantages
of
simplicity
and
of
certainty,
important
on
jurisdictional
questions
and
the
rule
suggested
by
the
union
is
difficult
to
apply
and
uncertain.
four
the
classic
reasons
for
diversity
that
is
prejudice
against
litigants
from
outside
the
state
is
unlikely
as
against
a
union
with
a
local
establishment.
we
finally
fear
if
the
long
settled
law
is
to
be
changed,
the
change
should
be
accomplished
by
legislation
after
completion
of
a
careful
study
now
being
made
by
the
american
law
institute
at
the
request
of
the
chief
justice
of
this
court.
now
on
the
first
point
the
record
consists
only
of
the
complaint,
the
summons,
the
notice,
the
motion
to
remove,
the
fallable
bond,
the
motion
to
remand,
an
affidavit
which
we
filed
by
a
plaintiff
in
a
companion
suit
mr.
n.f.
white
as
the
union's
local
membership.
the
district
court's
memorandum
opinion
was
rendered
after
an
informal
hearing
in
chambers
at
which
no
evidence
was
taken.
there
are
no
findings
of
fact
apart
from
the
memorandum
opinion.
the
record
as
such
contains
no
evidence
as
to
how
the
union
in
fact
is
organized,
how
the
union
in
fact
operates,
that
in
fact
its
principal
place
of
businesses
is
in
pennsylvania
or
is
the
union
as
thrown
in
its
brief
that
bouligny
is
a
prominent
local
corporation.
now
the
point
is
that
when
the
jurisdiction
on
diversity
grounds
is
put
in
issue,
the
burden
of
supporting
its
jurisdiction
allegations
falls
to
the
union
by
competent
proof.
there
is
a
case
which
we
cite
of
thompson
against
gaskill
decided
by
this
court
in
1942
in
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
for
the
court
said
the
policy
of
the
statute
conferring
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
courts
calls
for
strict
construction.
accordingly
if
a
plaintiff's
allegation
of
jurisdictional
facts
are
challenged
by
the
defendant,
the
plaintiff
bears
the
burden
of
supporting
the
allegations
of
complaint
by
--
allegations
by
competent
proof,
the
bill
must
be
dismissed,
if
the
evidence
in
the
record
does
not
support
the
allegations.
now
broadly
the
union
contends
in
this
case
that
you
should
adopt
the
rule
that
because
they
say
and
because
the
district
judge
said
and
because
certain
court
actually
assumed
that
a
modern
labor
union
has
these
corporate
characteristics,
that
the
same
rule
should
be
applied
to
it
as
has
been
applied
first
by
the
court
and
now
by
congressional
legislation
in
1958
to
corporations.
and
we
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
this
particular
corporation,
about
this
particular
defendant
that
would
enable
a
court
to
find
any
facts
and
that
under
the
law,
it
was
up
to
the
union
to
put
into
the
record
those
facts.
second
point,
when
the
action
was
filed
in
may
of
1963,
the
law
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
union
had
no
right
to
remove
from
the
state
to
federal
court
on
grounds
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
this
court
had
so
held
in
chapman
against
barney,
cited
in
our
brief,
in
great
southern
hotel
corporation
against
jones.
seven
of
the
ten
circuit
courts
of
appeals
had
so
held.
in
three
of
those
cases
this
court
had
denied
certiorari.
those
cases
are
cited
on
page
19
of
our
brief.
the
study
being
made
currently
by
the
american
law
institute
states
under
existing
law
the
actual
citizenship
of
each
member
apparently
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
diversity
exists,
i'm
quoting
the
american
law
institute
study.
about
five
years
ago,
chief
justice
of
this
court
requested
the
american
law
institute
to
make
the
study.
i'm
quoting
from
the
1965
proposed
final
draft
on
page
61.
i
will
read
the
language
again.
“under
existing
law
the
actual
citizenship
of
each
member
apparently
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
diversity
exists.”
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
i
would
like
under
my
fifth
point
to
come
to
that
if
i
may.
in
this
case,
removal
on
the
grounds
of
diversity
jurisdiction
could
haven
been
prevented
by
the
class
action
by
naming
defendant
union
members
as
defendants
to
residents
in
north
carolina.
now
again
if
i
might
make
reference
to
the
american
law
institute
report,
on
page
61
of
that
report,
the
law
on
that
point
is
thus
summarized.
“under
present
law
it
is
possible
to
create
or
avoid
federal
jurisdiction
by
bringing
suit
on
behalf
of
or
against
some
or
all
members
of
the
association
with
an
eye
to
their
citizenship
and
without
regard
to
the
principal
place
of
business
of
the
association
itself.”
see
discussion
in
international
allied
printing
trades
association
versus
master
printers,
34
federal
supplement,
178
a
district
court
in
new
jersey
in
1940.
there
also
on
the
same
point
is
a
fourth
circuit
opinion,
the
judge
parker
i
think
name
of
the
case
is
thompson
but
i
do
not
have
the
citation
to
the
particular
case.
i
emphasize
this
point
for
this
reason.
when
we
brought
the
suit
in
the
state
court,
the
law
was
clear
that
the
union
had
no
right
to
remove
on
diversity
grounds.
it
may
have
had
a
right
to
remove
on
federal
question
grounds
but
not
on
diversity
grounds.
if
we
thought
that
was
any
doubt
about
the
law,
we
could
have
brought
a
class
suit
and
foreclosed
the
thing
once
and
for
all
and
i
suggest
that
in
this
particular
suit
as
a
matter
equity
as
between
the
parties,
the
law
--
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
sir?
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
rule
your
honor,
bouligny
being
a
north
carolina
corporation
could
have
named
the
local
agent
and
some
other
local
members.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
no,
we
wish
to
stay
in
state
court.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes
we
brought
the
suit
in
the
state
court,
it
was
the
union
that
wished
to
go
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
under
north
carolina
practice
there
are
two
sections
of
our
law.
one
is
gs1-97,
passed
about
1939,
which
first
provided
for
serving
an
unincorporated
association
with
summons.
and
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
that
accomplished
the
whole
of
making
the
union
suiable,
so
that
in
1955,
there
was
an
additional
provision
added
that's
gs1-69,
which
specifically
says,
that
a
suit
may
be
brought.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes.
point
three,
the
existing
law
has
the
advantage
of
simplicity
and
of
certainty.
the
important
considerations
on
jurisdictional
questions
and
the
rule
that
has
been
suggested
by
the
union,
would
be
difficult
to
apply
and
would
be
uncertain.
it
has
been
two-and-a-half
years
since
this
action
was
filed
and
as
yet
the
union
has
not
filed
an
answer
to
the
complaint.
indeed
the
union
says
to
us
in
its
brief
that
it's
not
exhausted
its
motions
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
if
the
established
rule
had
been
applied
by
the
district
judge,
his
memorandum
opinion
said
that
he
didn't,
he
was
not
satisfied
about
the
law
and
he
would
like
to
know
what
the
law
was
and
therefore
on
his
motion
certified
to
the
circuit
court,
it
was
case
the
circuit
ought
to
take.
if
he
had
sent
the
case
back
to
the
trial
court
in
mecklenburg
county
for
trial
it
would
have
been
long
ago
disposed
of.
the
courts
in
that
county
and
indeed
in
most
of
north
carolina
current.
they
are
trying
cases
there,
on
the
facts
that
arouse
within
this
year,
some
within
six
months.
and
the
case
could
have
been
long
ago
disposed
of
and
i
think
of
course
equity
be
disposed
of
had
not
this
point
been
raised.
if
the
rule
were
to
be
followed
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
union
and
that
is
the
rule
that
the
union
says
was
announced
by
this
court
in
russell,
it
would
require
an
inquiry
by
the
district
court
in
each
particular
case,
in
order
to
verify
what
the
facts
in
that
particular
case
might
be.
in
other
words,
it's
a
rule
that
depends
on
the
facts
of
the
case
and
not
on
the
simple
fact
as
in
corporations
of
one
particular
thing
that
can
usually
be
easily
ascertained
from
the
record.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
one
labor
union
might
be
different
from
another.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
each
such
inquiry
would
require
time
and
expense
and
delay,
which
would
further
add
to
one
of
the
objections
trials
from
the
federal
court
and
that
is
the
time
consumed
and
expense
involved
in
litigating
what
are
normally
relatively
simple
matters.
if
the
union
rule
is
adopted
in
this
case,
it
would
yet
leave
to
plaintiffs,
the
device
of
class
action
that
might
be
brought,
so
that
it
would
not
really
catch
anyone
except
the
party
is
not
yet
aware
of
the
opportunity
of
bringing
the
class
action.
and
it
might
take
from
the
state
courts
determination
of
matters
that
really
should
belong
in
the
state
courts
for
determination.
except
to
the
extent
that
congress
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
may
have
preempted
the
field
or
given
some
directions,
if
affect
of
the
law
of
libel
is
a
matter
that's
to
be
determined
in
accordance
with
north
carolina
law,
if
the
case
is
tried
in
the
district
court,
it
will
of
course
be
the
duty
under
erie
against
tompkins
for
the
district
judge
to
apply
the
north
carolina
law
of
libel
to
this
case.
he
would
be
in
the
situation
of
applying
the
law
of
north
carolina
where
there
would
not
be
a
direct
appeal
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
which
is
i
understand
it
is
not
thought
by
authorities
to
be
a
desirable
situation.
i
suggest
to
you
under
the
fourth
point
that
the
classic
reason
for
diversity,
that
is
prejudice
against
litigants
from
out
of
the
state
is
unlikely
against
a
union
with
a
local
establishment.
i
might
suggest
to
you
that,
that
is
not
prejudiced
in
north
carolina
as
i
suppose
elsewhere,
that
the
country
clubs
against
labor
unions.
as
i
think
it
would
be
recognized,
that
they
are
many
social
and
economic
groups
in
which
corporations
and
corporate
officers
are
not
particularly
popular.
but
the
point
is
that
the
federal
courts
in
diversity
matters
do
not
sit
for
the
purpose
of
affording
jurisdiction
in
every
matter
of
prejudice,
but
sit
only
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
litigants
against
prejudice
which
arises
against
them
because
they
happen
to
reside
outside
the
state.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
any
prejudice
would
exist
against
the
union
in
this
case
it
would
not
be
helped
by
the
suggestion
that
this
union
happen
to
have
its
headquarters
in
greensboro,
north
carolina
or
some
other
place
in
north
carolina.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
any
prejudice
that
would
apply
against
this
union
it
does
not
arise
because
it
is
not
a
north
carolina
union,
it
arises
out
of
economic
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
briefs.
now
finally,
the
last
point
that
i
wish
to
make,
if
the
long
settled
law
is
to
be
changed,
the
change
should
be
accomplished
by
a
legislation,
after
completion
of
the
careful
study
that's
now
being
made
by
the
american
law
institute
at
the
request
of
chief
justice
of
this
court.
about
five
years
ago
chief
justice
made
that
request.
mr.
richard
field
of
the
harvard
law
school
was
named
as
the
reporter
of
that
study.
beginning
at
least
in
1962,
perhaps
in
1961,
but
i
believe
i'm
certain
as
to
1962
and
each
year
since
then
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
association,
mr.
field
and
the
distinguished
group
of
scholars
that
he
has
associated
with
him,
have
submitted
to
the
annual
meeting
of
the
american
law
institute
proposed
recommendations
in
regard
to
the
division
of
jurisdiction
between
the
state
and
the
federal
courts.
at
the
meeting
in
1965
there
was
submitted
a
proposed
final
draft
number
one,
which
completed
the
study
on
the
general
head
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
now
the
reports
that
have
been
submitted
contains
some
recommendations
in
regard
to
the
matter
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
reporters
recommend
some
changes.
they
do
not
recommend
the
changes
that
have
been
suggested
by
the
union.
what
does
now
1332
having
to
do
with
diversity
jurisdiction?
well
under
the
numbering
section
of
proposed
legislation
be
numbered
as
section
133.
that
would
provide
that
except
as
provided
in
this
section
and
section
1302
of
this
title,
that
district
courts
shall
have
jurisdiction
originally
or
on
removal
of
any
civil
action
between
citizens
of
different
states,
citizens
of
a
state
or
foreign
states
or
citizens
of
the
subject
thereof,
citizens
of
different
states
in
which
foreign
states
or
citizens
are
subject
thereof
additional
bodies,
wherein
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
or
value
of
$10,000
exclusive
of
interest
or
cost.
in
section
(b)
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
and
section
1302
of
this
title,
one
a
corporation
shall
be
deemed
a
citizen
of
every
state
or
foreign
state
by
which
it
has
been
incorporated
and
of
the
state
or
foreign
state
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
that
follows
section
(c)
of
the
passed
law
except
that
it
adds
the
language
a
foreign
state
which
is
thought
to
be
in
doubt
under
the
present
law
but
which
is
not
material
here.
it
then
adds
another
section
that's
directly
in
point
as
to
this
case.
a
partnership
or
other
unincorporated
association
capable
of
suing
or
being
sued
as
an
entity
in
the
state
in
which
an
action
is
brought
shall
be
deemed
a
citizen
of
the
state
or
foreign
state
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
whether
such
action
is
brought
by
or
against
such
partnership
or
other
unincorporated
association
or
by
or
against
any
person
as
an
agent
or
representative
thereof.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
it
would
be
removable
if
this
was
the
end
of
the
recommendations.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
but
there
is
a
section
1302
that
says
provided
however
and
it's
that
section
that
i
would
like
to
come
to,
but
before
i
do
it,
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
comments
about
this
section.
that
is
that
the
test
of
looking
to
the
characteristics
of
the
union
which
is
the
russel
suggestion,
is
not
here
adopted,
but
rather
the
suggestion
is
made
that
the
entity
be
recognized
if
under
the
law
of
the
state
it
has
the
capacity
to
sue
or
be
sued,
which
is
a
relatively
simple
test,
though
it
would
vary
from
place
to
place,
it's
a
rule
of
section
17(b)
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
a
union
--
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
it
also
you
will
notice
abolishes
this
device
of
the
class
suit,
because
it
provides
that
the
entity
theory
is
applied
even
though
the
action
is
brought
against
representatives
of
the
union.
now
in
section
3
just
for
sake
of
clarity
and
completeness,
there
is
a
section
added
that
it
would
reenact
the
1964
amendment
arising
out
the
louisiana
situation
in
which
a
direct
suit
against
an
insurance
company
was
authorized,
and
that
language
is
repeated.
and
then
section
4
is
language
which
would
avoid
the
device
of
appointing
an
executor,
citizen
of
another
state
of
the
purpose
of
creating
jurisdiction.
the
executor
is
also
to
be
deemed
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
the
deceased.
now
section
1302
says,
general
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction
exceptions,
the
jurisdiction
of
district
courts
under
section
1301
of
this
title
shall
be
subject
to
the
following
exceptions.
(a)
no
person
can
invoke
that
jurisdiction
either
originally
or
on
removable
in
any
district
in
a
state
of
which
he
is
a
citizen,
that's
the
most
profound
of
the
changes
that's
being
suggested.
the
statistics
indicates
that
something
like
45%
of
present
original
diversity
jurisdiction
would
be
eliminated
and
taken
from
the
federal
courts
as
result
of
this
provision
denying
to
the
plaintiff
a
federal
court
in
his
own
state.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
that
would
have
no
application
to
this
case.
(b)
no
corporation
incorporated
or
having
its
principal
place
of
business
in
the
united
states
and
no
partnership
unincorporated
association
or
sole
proprietorship
having
it's
principal
place
of
business
in
the
united
states,
which
has
and
for
a
period
of
more
than
two
years
maintained
a
local
establishment
in
the
state,
can
invoke
that
jurisdiction
either
originally
or
on
removal.
in
any
district
in
that
state
in
any
action
arising
out
of
the
activities
of
that
establishment.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
well
the
definition
of
a
local
establishment
is
defined
as
follows.
the
term
local
establishment
as
used
in
this
subdivision
means
a
fixed
place
of
business
where
or
in
connection
with
which
is
regular
part
of
such
business
services
are
rendered
or
accommodations
furnished
to
persons
within
the
state,
sales,
delivery
or
distribution
of
goods
are
made
to
persons
within
the
state
by
one
regular
maintaining
a
stock
of
goods
or
showroom
for
the
display
of
samples
and
three;
sales
of
insurance,
certificates
of
other
intangibles
or
real
property
or
interest
therein
are
made
to
persons
in
the
state;
four,
production
or
processing
takes
place.
now
as
this
section
establishing
the
additional
limitation
on
federal
jurisdiction
of
the
local
establishment
which
in
the
first
draft
was
--
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
well
it
may
not
if
your
honor
please.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
another
provision
that
says
that
this
would
not,
which
is
a
point
of
controversy
within
ali
at
this
point
or
was
at
the
annual
meeting.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
no
sir,
the
russell
way
is
to
look
at
particular
facts
of
the
entity,
all
the
facts.
the
ali
test
is
to
look
only
at
the
question
of
whether
under
state
law
it's
capable
of
suing
or
being
sued,
it
adopts
the
simple
test.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
well,
they
go
at
it
in
a
different
way,
but
i
am
suggesting
to
you
--
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
i
suggest
to
you
though
it's
vastly
superior
way
to
that
of
having
to
make
an
inquiry
into
each
particular
case.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
one
of
the
things
we
say
about
this
particular
unit
–
union
that
claims
to
have
all
the
authority
is
in
its
own
state
of
pennsylvania,
it
may
sue
only
in
the
name
of
trustees.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
which
we
say
is
a
fairly
serious
limitation.
mr.
joseph
w.
grier,
jr.
i
going
to
make
this
point
about
the
local
statute
rule,
it
applies
to
corporations
as
well
as
to
unincorporated
association
and
represents
an
effort
on
the
part
of
ali
people
to
contract
federal
jurisdiction
and
perhaps
the
basic
issue
here
is
the
question
of
how
far
should
federal
jurisdiction
go
that
may
cut
across
what
the
union
regards
as
the
trend
to
treat
any
of
these
in
a
different
way
from
what
they
were
formally
treated.
in
any
event
when
first
draft
of
this
came
in,
the
local
establishment
rule
had
no
application
to
unincorporated
associations.
the
floor
of
ali
insisted
that
it
ought
to,
so
in
1964
they
voted
to
include
it.
in
the
1965
draft
it
was
so
included
as
i
have
read
it
to
you
except
that
a
provision
then
appeared
to
this
effect,
the
provisions
of
this
subsection
shall
apply
only
to
entities
organized
or
operated
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
a
trade
investment
or
other
business
enterprises,
thought
by
the
reporters
to
exclude
religious,
charitable,
paternal
organizations
and
labor
unions
and
the
suggestion
was
made
that
it
seems
to
me
to
be
entirely
erroneous
that
the
reason
for
excluding
such
organizations
was
that
they
could
not
acquire
a
local
personality
as
could
a
business
organization.
i
would
think
that
if
any
group
could
acquire
a
local
personality
it
would
be
a
local
church
for
instance
or
some
other
eleemosynary
institution.
well,
to
summarize
then
let
me
say
that
we
think
that
the
law
is
well
settled
in
our
favor.
we
think
that
the
law
as
it
exists
is
simple.
we
think
if
the
law
is
to
be
changed
it
ought
not
be
changed
along
the
lines
of
russell,
which
would
be
complex,
but
that
it
would
be
better
as
a
matter
of
working
all
of
these
things
out
if
the
report
of
the
american
law
institute
could
be
completed
and
if
the
congress
could
then
have
appropriate
hearings
about
it
and
if
these
things
that
affect
venue,
affects
labor
relations
and
a
great
many
other
things
could
all
be
considered
at
one
time
and
the
thing
brought
about
in
an
orderly
fashion.
thank
you
very
much.
