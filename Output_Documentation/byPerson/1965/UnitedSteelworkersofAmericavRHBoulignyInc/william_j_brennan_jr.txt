justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
naming
the
defendant
as
a
union,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
you
may
under
north
carolina
practice
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
even
the
same
one,
i
gather,
your
position
might
be
--
in
different
cases
it
might
require
factual
inquiries
in
each
instance,
even
against
the
steelworkers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
means
that
if
that
had
been
in
effect
when
you
brought
your
action
against
the
steelworkers,
it
wouldn't
be
removable,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
under
the
law
of
north
carolina
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
steelworker
could
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
suit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
your
thought
would
be
that
if
steelworkers
has
local
unions
in
the
state
that
takes
them
out
of
landrum-griffin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
depend
i
suppose
whether
a
local
union
is
a
local
establishment,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
read
that
definition
of
local
establishment,
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
was
federal
labors
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
it's
true
is
it,
still
that
in
many,
many
states,
perhaps
in
most
unions
are
not
suiable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it's
a
long
time
since
i've
to
think
about
this,
but
it
used
to
be
i
know
that
you
couldn't
sue
in
most
states.
