mr.
henry
klepak
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
are
simple
and
not
in
dispute,
nor
have
questions
the
law
involved.
the
facts
are
that
one
gerald
segal
and
his
father,
sam
segal,
are
engaged
in
a
business
in
dallas,
texas,
known
as
segal
cotton
products.
a
petition
of
bankruptcy
was
filed
by
both
father
and
son
and
also
as
a
partner.
as
a
result
of
this
bankruptcy,
they
received
a
discharge
and
that
was
in
september
of
1961
when
the
petition
was
filed.
in
1962,
the
auditor
of
the
segal
cotton
products
filed
an
application
for
loss-carryback
for
refunds.
in
1963,
the
internal
revenue
department
did
pay
this
refund
by
agreement
between
myself
and
mr.
rochelle,
the
trustee
and
the
counsel,
the
monies
were
held
by
him,
were
the
outcome
of
this
case.
we
contended
that
the
money
belong
to
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
henry
klepak
yes.
mr.
henry
klepak
sure.
mr.
henry
klepak
september
of
1961
mr.
henry
klepak
the
claim
for
it
was
filed
in
1962
after
the
discharge
and
in
1963
the
money
was
paid,
and
since
then
we've
been
litigating.
mr.
henry
klepak
1961.
mr.
henry
klepak
that's
right.
now
in
--
at
that
point
then,
we
then
--
and
in
dispute,
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
held
that
the
funds
belong
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
as
part
of
the
--
the
estate
of
the
bankrupt.
the
district
court
upheld
a
certificate
of
findings
of
the
referee
in
bankruptcy.
it
was
then
filled
of
course
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
that's
when
trouble
started
because
at
that
time,
i
was
armed
with
two
circuit
courts
of
appeals
decisions
both
favorable
to
my
clients,
one
of
the
first
circuit
and
the
other,
the
third
circuit.
in
both
of
those
decisions,
they
held
that
this
tax
refund
was
windfall
to
the
taxpayer,
to
the
bankrupt.
and
there
were
the
funds
of
the
bankrupt
and
not
to
the
estate
that
is
to
the
bankruptcy.
and
it
became
a
very,
very
unpopular
decision
because
every
magazine
and
more
especially
the
national
association
of
referees
in
bankruptcy
journal,
a
number
of
law
reviews
such
as
texas
university,
stanford,
miami
university
and
other
law
reviews
all
wrote
rather
harsh
articles
against
both
the
first
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
for
their
findings.
the
first
and
third
circuit
simply
held
that
the
statute
as
written
did
not
give
or
place
a
property
right
in
the
bankrupt
at
its
time
of
bankruptcy
whereby,
he
could,
under
the
term
of
the
statute,
transfer
that
so-called
property
right.
he
didn't
have
one.
also,
they
brought
out
the
fact
that
the
provisions
of
the
code
provide
further
that
you
could
not
assign
a
claim
against
the
united
states
government.
we
bring
to
this
court's
special
attention
the
language.
first
i
do
want
to
bring
the
court's
attention
this
least,
that
section
17
which
is
in
controversy
--
controversy
here
which
is
known
70a
(5)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
this
act
was
passed
in
1898.
in
1942
is
when
they
first
brought
the
three-year
loss-carryback
to
five-year
forward.
and
that
period
of
time
elapsed.
the
language
that
it
uses
and
in
the
hearing
of
the
language,
and
this
is
under
the
bankruptcy
act
in
which
the
whole
issue
evolves
itself
--
a)
the
trustee
of
the
estate
of
the
bankrupt
shall
in
turn
be
vested
by
operation
of
law
where
the
title
of
the
bankrupt
as
the
date
of
filing
a
petition
initiating
a
proceeding
on
this
title
to
all
of
the
following
kinds
of
property
whatsoever
located,
here
we
mean
the
whole
thing.
the
property
including
rights
of
action
which
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
petition,
he
could
by
any
means
have
transferred
or
which
might
have
been
levied
upon
and
sold
under
judicial
process
against
him,
or
otherwise
seized,
impounded,
or
sequestered.
now,
our
position
is
this
that
the
statute
reads
very
clearly.
it
says
that
the
refund
only
comes
into
being
after
the
taxable
year.
in
other
words,
here
we
have
a
case
where
bankruptcy
was
taken
in
september
of
1961.
in
the
sussman
case,
which
was
a
case
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago
being
in
the
third
circuit,
that
was
filed
in
july
of
the
--
of
the
taxable
year.
in
the
fournier
case
which
is
out
of
first
circuit
that
was
filed
in
december
of
that
taxable
year.
the
court
being
that
at
the
date
of
filing
for
a
petition
of
bankruptcy
being
the
20th
--
7th
day
of
september
of
1961,
the
bankrupt
had
no
property
right,
and
here's
why.
because
he
had
to
conclude
and
complete
all
the
year
of
1961
before
there
could
be
any
slight
resemblance
to
any
kind
of
a
claim
he
might
make.
he
might
anticipate.
he
might
dream
of
that
he
has
one,
but
here's
what
occurs.
number
one,
he
had
the
additional
months
of
that
year
to
complete.
supposing
he
earned
up
money
to
offset
his
losses,
then
there
would
never
have
a
claim.
supposing,
number
two,
that
whatever
clauses
he
thought
he
might
have
was
denied
by
the
internal
revenue
department,
supposing
by
some
other
windfall
he
makes
profits
in
some
other
way,
still
his
position
as
far
as
the
date
of
his
bankruptcy
he
had
nothing
--
mr.
henry
klepak
alright.
mr.
henry
klepak
good
point
--
well
taken,
that's
right,
it
is.
i
was
wrong
in
saying
that
because
it
would
make
no
difference
what
the
internal
revenue
office
does.
mr.
henry
klepak
that's
right,
exactly.
now
the
first
and
third
circuit,
sussman
case
was
the
first
case.
and
the
judge
very
reluctantly,
the
judges
very
reluctantly
held
with
the
bankrupt.
and
they
say
so,
and
they
say
it's
a
windfall
but
they
say
the
statute
reads
exactly
the
way
it
says
and
we're
not
going
to
attempt
to
change
the
statute.
that
is
for
congress
to
do,
not
for
the
court
to
do.
in
the
third
circuit
or
rather
the
first
circuit,
they
adopted
the
findings
of
the
first
circuit,
took
exactly
the
same
position
and
use
the
same
word
of
windfall
and
they
too
took
the
same
position.
they
also
added
to
the
position
that
he
did
not
have
a
property
right.
they
provided
both
the
provision
of
31
u.s.c.,
that's
section
3477,
which
says
declaring
all
assignments
of
any
claim
upon
the
united
states
absolutely
null
and
void
unless
made
after
the
allowance
of
such
a
claim.
the
ascertainment
of
the
amount
due
and
the
issuing
of
a
warrant
for
the
payment
thereof
or
provisions
for
the
protection
of
the
government
and
not
for
the
regulation
of
equities
of
claimants
growing
out
of
regular
assignments
when
collection
is
complete
and
the
government's
liability
ended.
well,
that
is
cited
for
purposes
of
showing
that
one,
if
you
just
think
you
have
a
claim
against
the
government,
you're
in
no
position
to
make
an
assignment
until
the
government
recognizes
it
and
the
amount
of
ascertained
and
the
finding
is
made
in
your
favor,
then
you
may
do
it.
now,
there
are
a
number,
as
i
say,
these
decisions
were
not
popular.
and
when
i
appeared
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
new
orleans,
i
was
armed
with
the
first
circuit's
opinion
and
the
third
circuit's
opinion.
and
mr.
rochelle
came
up
with
just
some
magazine
articles
and
a
few
law
journal
reviews
and
i
thought
i
was
well
armed.
but
apparently,
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
take
the
same
view
because
the
fifth
circuit
“swam
around”
and
said
this
and
i
do
bring
this
to
the
court's
attention
because
this
is
a
test
case.
this
is
one
of
the
first
impression
for
this
court
because
we
now
have
our
circuit
courts
in
conflict
and
i
would
do
want
to
recite
--
or
cite
rather
from
the
circuit
judge
who
ruled
against
me
this
language,
“this
appeal
presents
a
question
of
prime
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
now,
the
reason
that
you
find
so
much
noise
about
that
in
the
journals
is
that
the
referees
in
bankruptcies
have
discovered
that
this
might
be
a
tremendous
thing
to
make
because
they
could
then
take
all
the
loses
the
bankrupts
may
have
had
and
check
back
and
see
if
they
have
paid
any
income
tax.
there
might
be
a
source
of
revenue
or
income
to
the
bankruptcy
courts.
on
the
other
hand,
here
is
something
that
we
must
just
think
about
when
we
do
this.
number
one,
presuming
i
am
wrong
about
the
fact
that
there
isn't
--
that
there
was
a
property
right,
just
presumingly.
then,
this
comes
to
my
mind.
the
statute
provides
for
a
three-year
loss-carryback
and
the
five-year
forward.
now,
what
happens
here?
here
in
september,
take
my
client's
position,
in
september
21st,
1961,
they
take
bankruptcy.
now,
they
had
to
do
something
to
the
remainder
of
that
year.
what
they
did,
none
of
us
know.
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
makes
those
findings
as
to
how
much
additional
loses
may
have
been
sustained
by
my
clients
between
september
and
december
the
31st
of
1961.
now,
the
fifth
circuit,
in
order
to
justify
its
finding,
it
does
this.
it
says,
one,
that
this
one
involved
shouldn't
go
to
the
bankrupt.
it
should
protect
the
creditors.
and
that
this
refund
should
then
go
back
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
made
available
for
questions.
now,
if
he's
trying
to
--
if
the
court
is
trying
to
protect
the
creditors,
he
is
only
protecting
the
creditors
who
are
listed
in
the
--
in
the
schedule
of
bankruptcy
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
what
about
the
creditors
that
were
created
between
september
the
21st
and
december
the
31st?
they
are
not
in
there.
now,
whatever
loses
they
may
lose
to
these
people,
they're
not
protected.
so
when
you
get
the
listing,
you
get
another
problem.
how
far
can
you
reach
out
if
this
law
abuses
the
taxpayer
right
to
go
five
years
forward?does
this
mean
that
a
bankrupt
for
five
years
has
his
hands
tied?
does
it
mean
that
anytime
in
five
years,
that
the
referees
or
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
he
comes
and
asks
“i
want
to
see
your
books.
i
want
to
see
what
kind
of
year
you
had
here”
and
determine
when
he
wants
to
make
this
loss
book
of
the
former
deal
to
be
able
to
get
some
money
into
the
estate.
now,
there's
got
to
be
a
closeout
somewhere.
i
think
this.
i
think
very
seriously
that
it
was
or
is
windfall.
the
amount
of
money
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
nothing
because
when
we
did
make
to
recover
of
these
refunds,
the
small
business
administration
has
the
money
come
and
it
grab
its
money
real
quick
and
left
us
with
some
pennies.
but
we
had
an
issue
and
we
have
one
which
we
felt
was
important.
and
more
especially,
if
you
think
we
have
our
circuit
courts
who
do
not
agree.
now
i'll
say
this.
it's
true
that
the
opinions
of
the
first
and
the
third
circuit
were
not
very
popular
but
by
the
same
token,
my
clients
of
bankrupt
weren't
very
popular
to
their
creditors
back
home
either.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
what
you're
going
to
have
to
do
--
you're
going
to
have
to
construe
the
question.
and
there's
only
two
questions.
one,
does
section
7
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
does
it
if
the
language
by
introduces
property
including
rights
of
action
which
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
petition,
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
petition,
he
could
by
any
means
have
transferred.
now,
could
the
bankrupts
in
this
case
on
september
the
21st,
could
they,
when
the
statute
meritoriously
says,
“you
cannot
make
an
application
for
a
refund
until
your
whole
taxable
year
has
been
completed.”
could
they
on
september
the
21st
stop,
put
an
application,
right
then
and
there
or
ascertain
a
claim
that
we
got
a
refund
coming
right
now.
no,
the
statute
prohibited.
the
statute
where
it
specifically
says,
“if
you
have
to
complete
your
calendar
year”,
the
calendar
year
of
december
31st.
so
the
question
is,
did
the
bankrupt
have
the
property
right
in
the
anticipated,
if
they
could
have
been
anticipated,
and
they
anticipated
lost
or
loss-carryback
and
refund.
the
second
part
is
that
presuming
you
find
that
there
was
a
property
right,
then
the
next
question
is,
does
--
is
it
in
conflict
with
the
statute
that
prevents
the
assignment
of
a
claim
against
the
united
states
government.
now,
there
are
other
cases
that
are
cited
both
sides
and
i
think
there's
was
a
quite
conflict
on
it.
but
i
think
there
is
no
conflict
on
issues,
strictly
one
of
law,
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
property
right
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
and
such
a
nature
that
it
could
have
been
transferred.
we
say
that
it
was
not.
mr.
henry
klepak
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
don't
see
it
in
either
--
there
are
no
special
provisions
for
a
corporate
set
up,
it's
all
the
same.
the
benefits
are
the
same
to
each
--
to
both
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
good
partnership
or
--
mr.
henry
klepak
yes,
that's
true
enough.
now,
bearing
this
one
i
realize
--
mr.
henry
klepak
yes,
it
does
but
how
do
you
realize
when
you
say,
“well,
if
you
want
to
seek
acquiesce,
you
might
have
say,
well
now,
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
take
the
funds
that
the
bankrupt
did
recover
and
give
it
to
a
creditor.”
and
that
would
be
alright,
i
mean,
if
you
just
want
to
be
generous.
but
that's
not
the
point.
what
we
have
here
is,
does
the
statute
give
that
forward.
mr.
henry
klepak
i
believe
(voice
overlap)
-
mr.
henry
klepak
i
believe
it
was
a
corporation
because
he
takes
over,
dealt
with
the
brief
with
me
over
here
but
i
--
i
think
he
takes
over
the
stock
of
the
corporation
as
well.
anyhow,
i'm
not
going
to
talk
about
that
if
it
didn't
raise
--
answer
that
question.
what
we
--
we
realize
and
i
do
realize
that
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
just
do
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
--
here,
the
fifth
circuit
court
says,
“well,
i
think
i
know
what
the
legislature
intended.”
it
was
not
a
question
whether
you
almost
guess
what
they
intend,
what
does
the
statute
really
say
and
that's
what
we
have,
and
i
think
exactly
directed
by
legislation.
mr.
henry
klepak
just
really
i
want
to
conclude,
just
one
remark.both
courts
did
hold
that
it
was
something
for
congress
to
correct.
i
do
want
to
reemphasize
above
the
five-year
statute
and
that
is
the
loss
of
carried
forward
five
years,
going
for
the
purpose
of
freeing
your
mind,
what
happens
to
the
bankrupt
if
he
chooses
not
to
go
for
the
three-year
loss-carryback
but
goes
forward.
does
he
carry
the
bell
around
his
neck
for
five
years
so
the
referee
or
trustee
in
bankruptcy
can
stand
for
him?
and
the
third
thing
i
want
to
share
this
court
is
that
these
are
my
clients
who
are
people
reputable
