mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices,
it
may
be
somewhat
unusual
to
commence
an
argument
with
emphasis
on
what
the
case
is
not
about.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
is
essential
to
a
proper
understanding
that
we
emphasize
that
this
case
does
not
involve
the
right
to
net
operating
loss
carried
forwards
in
the
trustees
like
in
no
contention
in
that
regard.
also
this
case
does
not
involve
rights
to
refund
in
any
taxable
year
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
and
the
trustee
is
making
no
contentions
in
that
regard.
neither
does
this
case
involved
loses
incurred
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy
and
prior
to
the
end
of
the
taxable
year.
now,
if
it
did
involve
such
loses,
i
think
no
particular
problem
would
be
presented
because
as
suggested
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
opinion
below,
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
prorate
the
refund,
that
portion
of
the
refund
attributable
to
the
loses
incurred
prior
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
would
go
to
the
trustee
and
that
portion
of
the
refund
determinable
losses
incurred
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy
and
prior
to
the
end
of
the
taxable
year
would
go
to
the
bankrupts.
but
this
isn't
the
case
here.
we're
involved
with
--
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
your
honor,
the
individual
--
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
--
partners
apparently
continued
to
work
--
continued
to
earn
money.
the
individual
partners
had
taxable
income
for
the
year
1961.
it
was
their
partnership,
the
segal
cotton
products
company
which
had
the
big
loss.
so
the
refund
came
about
by
reason
of
the
excess
of
the
lost
over
the
taxable
income
of
the
individual
partners.
and
of
course,
the
individual
partners
were
entitled
to
their
portion
of
share
of
the
loss
of
partnership.
that's
how
it
came
up.
this
is
a
case
--
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
in
these
cases,
it
has
been
administered
in
a
consolidated
proceeding.
but
this
case
here
involves
the
two
individual
bankrupts
and
of
course,
it
was
they,
as
individuals,
were
entitled
to
refund
not
for
partnership.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
no,
your
honors,
straight
bankruptcy.
i
think
the
principle
would
be
no
difference,
there
were
but,
it's
straight
bankruptcy
nevertheless.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
they
didn't.
the
partnership
business,
segal
cotton
products,
did
not
continue
to
operate.
it
seized
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
but
the
two
individual
partners
of
course
had
some
earnings
during
the
remainder
of
that
year
from
other
employment.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
their
earnings
were
deducted
from
the
loss
to
make
the
net
operating
loss-carryback
refunds.
this
is
the
case
of
statutory
interpretation
and
we,
therefore,
should
construe
the
statute
in
the
light
of
its
purpose.
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
bankruptcy
act
is
to
ensure
the
equitable
distribution
of
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt
to
his
creditors.
as
collier
says,
70a
(5)
is
bold
in
searching
and
has
been
drawn
to
comprise
all
properties
that
may
be
of
use
or
benefit
to
the
bankrupt.
now,
the
third
circuit
in
its
opinion
in
sussman
said,
“this
is
an
unfortunate
result.
we
regret
it,
but
congress
must
make
the
change
and
the
change
is
indicated.
we
think
this
is
not
so.”
the
third
circuit
would
have
congress
make
a
specific
exception.
but
the
statute,
we
think,
none
is
necessary.
the
statute
is
necessarily
counts
in
broad,
general
language.
this
must
be
so
if
congress
were
to
undertake
to
spell
out
and
describe
every
particular
and
distinct
type
and
kind
of
property
right,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
would
be
literally
thousands
of
subsections
to
section
70.
and
then
congress
could
never
catch
up
because
new
property
rights
are
being
created
all
the
time.
indeed,
this
one
was
created
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
but
this
makes
no
difference.
the
third
circuit
is,
the
same
circuit
that
handed
down
sussman,
held
in
chandlers
v.
nathans
that
the
right
to
an
ordinary
tax
refunds
passed
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
even
though
that
right
was
not
created
until
1918
and
the
statute
was
passed
in
1898.
now,
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
my
very
distinguishing
capable
adversary.
what
would
be
the
case
in
the
case
of
a
corporation?
now,
i
disagree
with
my
adversary's
answer
on
that
point.
in
bankruptcy,
the
corporate
shell
does
not
pass
to
the
trustee.
the
corporation
has
and
indeed
continues
to
exist
if
for
any
reason
they
want
to
continue
the
existence
of
the
corporation
and
there
maybe
a
number
of
good
reasons
to
continue
it,
for
example,
the
net
operating
loss
that
are
involved.
therefore,
that
would
be
the
distinctly
involved
to
the
old
corporate
share
--
or
to
the
old
stockholders,
the
creditors
would
take
now.
now,
in
order
to
be
a
right
which
--
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
corporation,
partnership,
and
individual,
no
difference.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
to
be
proper
--
to
be
right
which
passes
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
under
section
70,
the
right
must
pass
two
tests.
in
the
first
place,
it
must
be
property.
and
in
the
second
place,
it
must
be
property
which
is
transferal.
so
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
first
of
these
questions.
this
right
to
a
refund
is
a
vested
statutory
right.
indeed,
the
first
words
in
26
u.s.c.a.
section
172
are,
“there
shall
be
allowed.”
now,
admittedly,
the
realization
of
this
right
is
postponed
until
after
the
end
of
the
taxable
year.
admittedly
the
amount
is
uncertain
until
the
end
of
the
taxable
year.
but
postponement
of
right
to
realization
certainly
could
not
affect
the
status
of
this
right
as
property.
otherwise,
a
note
receivable
payable
to
the
bankrupt
but
not
yet
to
due
would
not
pass
to
the
trustee,
nor
there
is
uncertainty
of
time
and
amount
or
contingency
in
other
words
affect
the
status
of
this
right
as
property.
now,
in
our
state
of
texas,
we
deal
and
trade
in
everyday
the
most
contingent
possible
kinds
of
rights,
those
in
oil
and
gas
for
example.
when
there
is
a
transfer
of
rights
under
an
oil
and
gas
lease,
sometimes
the
transferor
will
reserve
an
overridding
royalty
interest
to
take
effect
after
payoff.
if
conceive
of
anything
more
contingent
than
this,
in
the
first
place,
there's
got
to
be
discovery
of
oil
and
gas
in
paying
quantities.
the
second
place,
there's
got
to
be
payout
of
the
person
who
drill
the
well,
this
may
never
happen.
but
this
doesn't
affect
the
status
of
that
overriding
royalty
interest
as
property.
and
indeed
these
interests
are
transferred
in
substantial
amounts
of
money
everyday,
nor
has
there
ever
been
a
question
that
such
a
highly
contingent
and
speculative
right
would
pass
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
there
are
many
cases
cited
in
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
trial
court
below
and
in
our
brief,
where
contingent
rights
have
been
held
to
pass.
this
court
in
williams
against
heard
held
that
the
right
passed
to
the
trustee
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
in
1875.
there
wasn't
even
a
right
which
existed.
there
was
only
a
loss,
the
right
may
become
into
being
and
if
congress
made
provision
for
an
award
under
the
treaty
in
1886
some
11
years
later.
and
now,
in
(inaudible),
a
contingent
remainder
was
held
to
pass
in
spite
of
the
fact
the
remainder
stood
to
be
entirely
defeated
if
the
beneficiary
pre-decision
is
(inaudible).
horton
against
moore
was
another
case
for
the
sixth
--
fifth
circuit
involving
the
same
type
of
situation.
and
then
the
ninth
circuit,
kleinsmith
--
kleinschmidt
against
schroeter,
a
man
had
forfeited
every
right
he
had
in
a
mining
venture
except
the
possibility
that
it
his
erstwhile
partners
later
sold
the
venture
and
got
enough
money
for
it
to
pay
them
back
for
their
advances,
then
he
might
back
in
for
some
sort
of
contribution.
this
contingent
interest
was
held
passed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
there
are
other
cases
which
are
applicable
and
important.
now,
as
to
the
transferability
of
the
right,
this
court
held
in
spindle
v.
shreve
that
what
is
transferrable
is
a
question
of
state
law.
there
has
never
been
any
doubt
that
under
texas
law
where
this
case
arose,
contingent
interest
are
transferable,
in
cases
recited
in
the
brief
for
that
fact.
i
think
there's
been
no
doubt
that
it's
--
that
common
law
contingent
claims
as
far
as
i
know.
now,
i
would
not
presume
to
advise
this
court
whether
or
not
contingent
claims
are
assignable
in
pennsylvania
or
whether
they
are
assignable
in
new
hampshire.
there
are
cases
cited
in
record
incidently,
at
page
22,
the
whole
of
that
contingent
remainders
in
pennsylvania
are
not
assignable.
but
sussman
did
not
bottom
its
decision
on
any
contention
that
contingent
claims
are
not
assignable
in
pennsylvania,
nor
did
fournier
bottom
its
decision
on
new
hampshire
law.
sussman's
result
came
about
because
the
court
said,
“you
can't
assign
under
the
assignment
of
claims
act.
now,
as
long
ago
as
1828,
in
comegys
against
vasse,
this
court
held
or
this
court
inquired,
is
it
a
possibility
coupled
with
an
interest?
if
it
is,
therefore
it
said,
then
it
passes
through
the
trustee
then
called
the
assignee
in
bankrupts.
now,
as
to
these
two
cases
with
which
my
adversary
is
on
--
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
i'm
coming
to
that
now,
your
honor.
the
third
circuit
in
sussman
said
and
i
quote,
“perhaps
this
expectation
can
be
described
as
a
contingent
claim
against
the
united
states.
thereby,
i
think
admitting
that
this
is
a
contingent
claim,
then
they
said,
“but.”
it
is
contrary
to
the
assignment
of
claims
act
and
therefore
is
not
transferable.
now
it's
unfortunate
i
think
but
i
think
it's
also
true
that
with
the
pressure
of
the
dockets,
that
our
good
judges
on
our
circuit
courts
are
forced
to
rely
more
and
more
on
the
help
they
get
from
counsel
and
have
less
and
less
time
for
independent
research,
nobody
apparently
called
the
attention
of
the
third
circuit
to
erwin
against
the
united
states
or
the
united
states
against
gillis.
both
decisions
by
this
court
which
established
the
rule
which
has
been
enforced
for
many,
many
years
that
the
assignments
of
--
assignment
of
claims
act
has
no
applicability
to
assignments
by
operation
of
law
or
transfers
by
operation
of
law.
they
said
it
has
no
applicability
to
the
enforceability
of
the
assignment
as
between
the
parties.
it
is
designed,
yet
the
statute
is
designed
for
the
protection
of
the
government.
now,
a
trustee
takes
under
section
70
by
the
very
wording
of
the
statute
“by
operation
of
law.”
and
therefore,
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
third
circuit
did
bottom
their
decision
on
this,
which
so
plainly
has
gone
through
erwin
against
united
states
and
united
states
against
gillis.
now,
the
first
circuit
--
the
first
circuit
in
fournier,
which
followed
sussman,
avoided
that
anti-assignment
statute
was
proper.
they
based
it
from
the
idea
that
the
right
was
followed.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
yes,
it
was
not
proper.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
now,
as
to
sussman
--
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
it
must
have
been
transferrable
on
the
date
of
bankruptcy
by
the
bankrupt
itself.
mr.
william
j.
rochelle,
jr.
i
think
it
does,
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
the
--
because
the
third
circuit
said,
“perhaps
it
is
brought
but
it
is
rendered
nonassignable
by
virtue
of
the
statute.”
and
these
decisions
of
this
court
has
said,
the
statute
does
not
render
a
claim
against
the
government,
nontransferable
by
operation
of
law.
it
has
no
application
from
that
situation.
now,
fournier,
by
the
first
circuit
cited
one
case
and
that
was
the
sussman
case.
there
was
no
mention
on
williams
against
heard,
or
comegys
against
vasse
or
horton
versus
moore,
or
kleinschmidt
against
schroeter,
or
the
many,
many
other
cases.
now
there
again,
we
must
presume
that
the
first
circuit
was
not
made
aware
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
on
contingent
claims
passing
to
address
the
bankruptcy.
certainly,
had
it
been
made
aware
of
such
decisions,
these
decisions
at
least
would
have
justified
some
comment
or
some
effort
to
distinguish,
but
they
were
not
mentioned.
the
only
case
cited
by
fournier
was
sussman.
now,
before
i
close
and
in
order
that
this
court
perhaps
maybe
read
of
me
and
mr.
klepak
today,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
practical
effects
of
a
holding
which
would
sustain
the
rule
of
sussman,
the
court
there
admitted
that
this
is
a
windfall
to
the
bankrupt
that
the
--
the
expense
on
his
creditors,
the
refunds
coming
about
by
reason
of
the
losses
incurred
with
these
credited
money.
but
now
i
would
point
out
also
through
the
court
that
the
sussman
rule
would
act
as
the
greatest
possible
encouragement
to
prospective
bankrupts
to
run
up
their
losses
prior
to
filing
a
voluntary
petition,
doing
anything
which
might
result
in
an
increase
loss
at
the
expense
of
their
creditors
who
increase
the
refund
with
which
--
with
which
they
might
go
south.
last
--
last
month,
before
the
national
association
of
referees
in
bankruptcy,
representatives
of
the
department
of
justice
and
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
appeared
and
gave
papers
on
how
racketeers
are
moving
in
to
the
bankruptcy
area.
they
pointed
out
that
they
will
go
into
a
community
acquire
control
surreptitiously
of
an
ongoing
concern
with
a
good
credit
ready,
build
up
huge
inventory,
sell
it
off,
perhaps
it
is
sacrifice
in
order
to
convert
it
to
cash
either
put
the
organization
in
the
bankruptcy
or
permit
it
to
go
in
with
the
trustee
getting
an
entirely
inadequate
set
of
records
and
no
way
to
trace,
and
the
racketeers
going
south
with
the
merchandiser,
the
proceeds.
now,
what
a
greater
attraction
to
these
gentleman
would
it
be
if
they
could
also
go
south
with
the
mid-operating
loss-carryback
refund.
i
will
close
but
i
would
urge
upon
--
that
the
court
of
bankruptcy
is
essentially
a
court
of
equity.
and
in
the
exercise
of
the
jurisdiction
conferred
upon
it
by
the
bankruptcy
act,
if
the
bankruptcy
court
applies
principles
and
rules
of
equity
jurisprudence,
the
powers
of
the
court
have
been
invoked
through
the
end
that
fraud
will
not
prevail,
that
substance
will
not
give
way
to
form,
that
technical
considerations
will
not
prevent
substantial
justice
from
being
done.
those
are
the
words
of
this
court
in
pepper
versus
litton
in
1937.
they
are
applicable
today
even
more
so
than
they
were
then.
and
i
think
and
submit
that
they
have
special
applicabilities
to
the
case
involved.
