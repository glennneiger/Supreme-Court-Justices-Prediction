i
just
--
may
i
get
that
chronology
--
justice

one
more
time.
justice

the
petition
in
bankruptcy
was
filed
when?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
claim
for
refund?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
refund
was
for
what
taxable
year?
justice
potter
stewart
1961,
the
--
the
year
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
second
--
your
second
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
suppose
that
his
claims
were
denied,
it
shouldn't
be
as
positive
because
of
many
claims
are
--
are
i
would
think
he
would
concede
property
of
the
bankrupt
which
may
or
may
not
be
good
claims,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
long
as
it's
a
good
valid
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
--
what
happened
here
between
the
dates
of
bankruptcy
in
the
end
of
the
taxable
year
with
respect
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
property
losses?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
--
i
thought
both
the
partners,
both
the
--
both
the
segals
as
partners
and
also
each
one
of
them
individually
went
into
bankruptcy.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
how
did
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
just
simple
bankruptcies
or
any
chapter
11
or
anything
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
don't
quite
see
how
they
continue
to
operate
after
bankruptcy.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
--
your
answer
is
that
the
rule
is
the
same
--
with
respect
to
a
corporation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
respect
to
a
natural
person.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
