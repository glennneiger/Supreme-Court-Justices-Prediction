suppose
there
were,
mr.
klepak,
suppose
it
was
for
a
corporation,
instead
of
individuals
and
partnership,
would
that
make
any
difference
in
the
practical
consequences
of
the
rule
for
what
you're

what
happened
then
would
be
that
the
corporation
would
get
--
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
refund
and
as
distinguished
from
the
corporation
in
the
hands
of
the
trustee,
is
that
what
comes
to
(voice

and
it
sounds

sounds
kind

now,
i'm
not

i'm
interested
in
that
kind
of
a
judgment,
i'm
just
interested
in
what
practical
consequences
of
this
rule
for
which
you're
contending
would
be
as
applied
to
a
corporation?
would
it
--
would
the
trustee
end
up
with
the
proceeds
of
the
refunds
in
either
event
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
whatever
the
theory
might
be,
sir?
