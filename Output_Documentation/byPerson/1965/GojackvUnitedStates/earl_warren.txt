investigation
that
they're

--
chief

well
the
indictment
didn't
come
before

chief

earl

--
are
we
dealing

chief

chief
justice
earl
warren

i
say
aren't

chief

what
are
you

about
newspaper
reports
before?
what
does
that
convey?
is
that
notice
to

--
chief

what

record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
we
have
nothing
--
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
newspaper,
the
propaganda
of
the
committee,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
union
election?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
he
didn't
know
it
--
know
anything
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
testify
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
we
look
to
here
to
see
what
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee
was
the
scope
of
this
investigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
as
of
the
time
of
the
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
yeagley
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
that
a
committee
with
a
broad
jurisdiction
that
this
committee
had,
has
the
right
to
appoint
each
member
of
the
its
committee
as
a
subcommittee
and
without
giving
--
putting
any
limitations
upon
them
of
any
kind,
give
each
member
the
right
to
roam
the
country
and
pick
out
anything
that
that
member
chooses
to
investigate
in
the
field
of
the
broad
jurisdiction
of
the
major
committee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
it
does,
except
that
this
is
one
--
this
is
one
subcommittee
and
if
it
can
do
it
with
one,
why
can't
they
do
it
with
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
change
my
question
and
divide
the
main
committee
up
into
three
instead
of
one,
and
just
send
them
roaming
around
the
country
to
pick
out
anything
they
want
to
investigate
within
the
broad
jurisdiction
of
the
committee
without
specifying
what
they
want
investigated
or
what
the
limitations,
if
any,
are
on
the
committee
leaving
it
to
the
subcommittee
to
choose
anything
that
it
wants
to
choose
that
it
might
think
bears
upon
the
question
of
subversion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it
can
do
it
with
this
committee,
why
can't
it
do
it
with
all
the
members
of
the
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
limitation
then
do
they
put
upon
this
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
we
bound
by
that
then,
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
limitation
put
on
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
a
continuing
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
american
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let
me
put
it
to
you
a
little
more
simply.
do
you
think
that
would
be
an
order
for
the
main
committee
to
divide
itself
into
threes
and
appoint
each
group
of
three
to
have
all
of
these
powers
of
investigation
and
permit
them
to
roam
the
whole
country
and
select
their
own
subjects
of
investigation
without
any
direction
of
any
kind
from
the
committee
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
your
answer
is
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
they
have
the
power
though
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
it
authorize
any
subject
investigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
yeagley,
did
the
major
committee
have
the
same
personnel
in
this
congress
that
it
had
in
the
prior
congresses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
do
know
that
they
change
from
year
to
year,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
how
would
we
know
because
of
what
former
committee,
the
congress
had
done
that
this
committee
by
a
majority
vote
would
have
done
the

thing.
