mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
presentation
by
petitioner's
counsel,
i
would
like
to
treat
at
the
outset
with
the
authorization
of
the
committee
and
to
show
that
the
procedures
followed
were
regular
and
was
called
for
by
rules
and
the
law,
and
to
contest
with
him
a
bit
on
seeger
and
lamont.
now
i
think
as
background,
it
is
germane
and
of
use,
to
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
this
committee
had
not
only
in
prior
years
but
in
the
preceding
year
conducted
investigations
of
communist
infiltration
into
labor
unions
particularly
into
the
united
electrical
and
radio,
machine
workers
of
which
this
man
was
a
member.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
mates
and
other
witness
subpoenaed
have
been
subpoenaed
at
a
previous
hearing
the
previous
year
and
--
but
did
not
appear
and
was
to
have
been
called
at
a
later
date.
the
committee's
investigation
in
this
union
brings
forth
subjects
not
unfamiliar
to
this
court
such
as
watkins
who
was
member
of
this
union,
deutch,
emspak
were
members
of
this
union
and
their
cases
have
gone
through
the
courts.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
deutch,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
in
the
ue,
and
they
were,
as
i
recall
it,
but
there
the
question
that
he
had
been
asked
was
relating
to
activity
at
cornell
and
the
--
apparently
the
authorization
there
was
for
the
purpose
was
investigation
of
communist
infiltration
on
the
labor
and
the
student's
point
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that's
right,
and
the
student
point
was
--
the
crucial
issue
there
was
underlain
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
so
when
the
full
committee,
i
believe
one
member
being
absent
in
that,
on
february
9,
1955
that
background
becomes
of
importance.
this
was
not
a
five-minute
meeting
where
they
just
appointed
a
subcommittee.
the
record
shows
that
it
lasted
an
hour
and
five
minutes
or
an
hour
and
a
quarter,
something
of
that
sort.
that
time,
a
motion
was
agreed
to,
that
provided
that
this
david
mates
and
john
gojack
should
be
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
subcommittee,
and
it
did
say
a
committee
on
internal
security
[inaudible]
in
open
hearing
at
in
fort
wayne,
indiana.
there's
the
authorization
from
the
full
committee
to
the
chairman
to
appoint
a
subcommittee
for
the
subcommittee
to
hold
a
hearing
and
it
states
the
city
in
which
it
is
to
be
held.
in
the
course
of
the
meeting
and
in
the
presence
of
the
others
the
chairman
designated
the
members
of
the
subcommittee
and
set
the
date
as
february
21.
later
on,
because
it
was
discovered
that
this
hearing
might
interfere
with
a
union
election
that
would
follow
by
three
days,
the
date
of
the
hearing
was
postponed
from
the
21st
to
the
28th.
this
was
done
by
the
committee
chairman
under
his
authority,
but
he
called
a
committee
meeting
thereafter
advised
them
of
the
continuance
of
the
hearing,
this
committee
meeting
was
held
on
the
23rd,
so
here
is
another
meeting
of
the
committee
about
the
hearings
in
fort
wayne.
however,
they
changed
the
place
of
the
hearings
in
view
of
the
change
of
date
from
fort
wayne
to
washington,
so
there
is
another
consideration.
the
committee
resolution
of
january
20th,
that
hasn't
been
mentioned,
authorized
the
chairman
to
appoint
subcommittees
to
act
and
carry
out
the
business
of
the
committee
--
full
committee
with
the
full
power
and
authority
of
a
full
committee.
when
the
committee
came
into
session
and
before
the
witnesses,
immediately
after
the
witness
were
sworn,
the
chairman
announced
the
purpose
of
the
investigation.
at
that
time
he
stated,
“there
will
be
considered
at
this
hearing
testimony
relating
to
communist
party
activities
within
the
field
of
labor.
the
methods
used
by
the
communist
party
to
infiltrate
labor
organizations,
and
the
dissemination
of
the
communist
party
propaganda.”
an
examination
of
the
record
will
disclose
that
the
questions
asked
not
only
to
this
witness,
but
to
the
other
witnesses
related
to
that
subject
matter.
i
believe
this
court
has
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes
that
is
the
first
advice
to
witnesses
as
to
the
scope
of
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
that
appears
in
the
record
other
than
the
course
that
the
indictment,
later
on
and
before
trial
the
indictment
alleged
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no,
no
not
before
that.
this
is
the
first
time
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
however
it
does
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well
other
than
newspaper
cuttings
or
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understood
your
question
chief
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes
indeed,
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
those
were
on
the
record,
i'm
sorry,
those
were
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
we're
dealing
with
the
record,
right.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
we
are
dealing
with
the
record.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no,
what
i
--
i
misstate
it.
what
i
intended
to
mention
was
that
prior
to
the
hearing,
the
washington
representative
of
the
union
had
come
to
the
committee
in
an
effort
to
get
discontinuance
and
they
had
had
discussions
that
an
investigation
of
this
nature,
i
admit
it
is
not
spelled
out,
would
interfere
with
the
election
to
be
held
three
days
after
the
hearings.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
the
nlrb
had
called
an
election
in
fort
wayne
in
which
there
are
other
unions
interested
and
the
chairman
had
not
known
of
this
apparently.
they
had
received
a
telegram
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
he
--
it's
in
the
records
mr.
chief
justice
i'm
not
sure
that
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
he
said
--
the
record
contains
testimony
as
to
the
meeting
with
the
washington
representative
for
this
reason.
the
congressman
made
this
meeting
an
official
meeting
of
the
committee
and
a
recorder
--
the
minutes
were
recorded
by
the
committee
reporter
as
to
what
was
said
by
the
congressman
and
was
said
by
i
believe
by
mr.
goldstein
regarding
the
request
for
a
postponement.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
some
questions
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
goldstein
would
testify
under
oath
that
there
was
an
election
coming
up,
because
the
chairman
apparently
did
not
know
of
it,
did
not
heard
of
it,
and
asked
him
to
put
it
on
the
record
of
the
committee.
shortly
prior
to
that
meeting,
the
chairman
had
received
a
telegram
on
february
10th,
i
believe,
from
the
petitioner
here,
vigorously
and
bitterly
protesting
the
hearings
and
making
reference
to
the
previous
congressman
thomas'
conviction
and
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
that
the
companies
were
behind
the
hearing
and
there
were
some
rather
strong
language
to
such
an
extent
that
there
were
some
strong
feelings
that
the
goldstein
meetings
later
on,
when
goldstein
came
in
and
wanted
a
continuance
because
of
an
election,
the
chairman
was
quite
dubious
that
there
was
such
an
election
apparently,
and
the
record
clearly,
clearly
reflects
that.
i
mention
this
to
show
that
although
the
opening
statement
of
the
chairman
that
the
first
time
that
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
was
formally
spelled
out
that
there
had
been
the
telegram
from
the
petitioner.
there
had
been
the
request
from
mr.
goldstein,
the
washington
representative,
for
continuance
because
such
a
hearing
would
interfere
with
the
election.
on
that
occasion
that
continuance
or
postpone
was
not
granted.
subsequently,
the
then
counsel
of
petitioner
called
the
counsel
of
the
committee,
i
think
on
february
16th
and
satisfied
him
of
advisability
of
a
postponement
and
the
committee
counsel
reached
the
chairman
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
he
agreed
that
was
a
right
procedure.
now
the
petitioner
is
relying
on
this
matter
for
authority
on
lamont
and
seeger
cases.
incidentally,
perhaps
i
think
i
should
mention,
as
far
as
i
could
find
in
the
rules
of
the
committee
there
is
no
committee
rule
or
house
rule
that
requires
that
the
purpose
or
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
be
spelled
out
in
advance
in
a
committee
resolution
formally.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
not
done
in
watkins.
it
was
not
--
all
i
can
say
it
was
not
done
there,
i
don't
know.
but
my
point
is
that
it
had
been
done
in
prior
cases
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
court
may
look
to
other
parts
of
the
proceeding
to
determine
what
the
subject
on
their
inquiry
was
and
whether
the
petitioner
at
the
time
he
was
answering
the
questions
understood
the
pertinency
or
was
advised
of
it.
it's
true
it
must
be
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
subject
under
inquiry
mr.
justice?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
as
of
the
time
of
the
hearing,
it
would
be
the
opening
statement
of
the
chairman,
mr.
chief
justice
when
he
made
the
statement
that
i've
just
read
to
you.
later
on
the
petitioner
was
advised
by
the
chairman
and
the
counsel
and
other
members
of
the
committee
on
at
least
four
occasions
of
the
committee's
interest
in
determining
his
party
membership
whether
he
is
now
a
party
member
for
the
reasons
of
the
committee's
interest
in
communist
infiltration
under
the
labor
field.
the
petitioner,
i
believe
i
should
get
back
to
these
two
cases
or
i'll
miss
them,
the
lamont
case
was
i'm
sure
--
as
the
court
recalls
was
before
the
committee
on
government
operations.
the
resolution
there
authorized
the
committee
to
conduct
investigations
into
matters
of
budget,
the
efficiency
and
economy
of
the
government.
the
questions
asked
of
the
witness
however
dealt
with
matters
of
subversion
and
the
court
of
course
said
that
a
pleading
of
the
authority
of
the
committee
did
not
plead
them
authority
to
ask
questions
on
subversions
and
now
there's
no
linking
up
in
any
manner
on
the
question
of
subversion
to
an
authorization
to
investigate
for
budget,
economy
or
efficiency.
in
the
seeger
case,
which
also
dealt
with
the
authority
to
the
committee
and
the
allegation
of
authority
and
indictment,
what
happened
there
was
that
the
resolution
that
was
alleged
an
indictment
that
the
committee
conduct
an
investigation
was
in
fact
a
resolution
that
the
clerk
conduct
an
investigation.
there
had
been
another
resolution
adopted
regarding
the
appointment
of
a
subcommittee
and
that
it
should
hold
hearings.
that
resolution
not
only
was
not
plead
in
the
indictment,
it
was
not
submitted
in
answer
to
a
bill
of
particulars.
i
think
that
there's
reason
to
feel
in
the
case
that
the
committee
itself
couldn't
find
the
resolution
for
this.
but
in
any
event,
the
result
was
not
only
was
the
authorized
resolution
not
plead
in
the
indictment,
but
in
each
case,
the
witness
was
misled.
the
witness
was
misled
in
lamont
by
the
nature
of
the
resolution
and
the
witness
was
misled
in
seeger
by
the
fact
that
the
resolution
that
actually
authorized
the
subcommittee
was
not
plead
at
all.
they
plead
a
resolution
apparently
inadvertently
that
authorized
the
clerk
to
make
the
investigation.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
there
is
no
formal
statement
in
the
committee
resolution
to
the
subcommittee
of
the
subject
of
the
inquiry.
is
that
what
you
have
in
mind
mr.
justice
fortas?
i
should
observe
there,
however,
that
as
far
as
i
recall
there
has
been
no
decision
of
this
court,
and
i
don't
believe
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry,
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
must
be
spelled
out
formally
in
a
resolution
of
the
committee.
there's
no
rule
of
the
house
to
my
knowledge
that
requires
that
in
the
course
in
discussing
this
problem
in
other
cases.
i'm
talking
about
whether
the
witness
understood
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
and
i
think
that
is
the
real
problem.
it
has
said
that
they
may
look
to
the
opening
statement
when
there's
nothing
else
and
if
that
can
satisfy
it.
i
think
the
crux
of
the
question
might
well
be,
was
the
witness
misled?
did
the
witness
understand
what
the
subject
of
inquiry
was?
was
he
advised
of
it
at
the
time?
he
came
in
before
he
was
sworn,
before
he
testified,
and
his
counsel
in
his
behalf
and
in
behalf
of
the
two
witnesses
that
preceded
him
filed
a
rather
lengthy
motion
moving
that
the
subpoenas
be
vacated
and
challenging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee.
this
rather
well
thought
out
motion
and
detailed
motion
did
not
raise
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
committee
in
any
manner
and
i
think
it
is
worthy
to
note
that
in
the
bill
of
particulars
that
was
later
filed,
petitioner
didn't
seem
to
have
been
misled
by
this
at
all
at
that
point
because
he
didn't
ask
anything
of
this
nature
in
the
bill
of
particulars.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
--
that
poses
a
different
situation
i
think
that
might
have
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it
strikes
me
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
committee
of
three
and
its
method
of
operation
and
function
of
the
chairman
is
somewhat
different
than
a
subcommittee
of
one.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no
i
don't
think
that
should
be
done
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
position
either
of
the
government
or
the
committee,
but
if
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
such
a
ways
to
concede
that
it
is
done
or
has
been
done
because
i
don't
think
it
has
been
done
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
proper
i
agree
with
you
on
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
there
is
no
formal
language
in
any
resolution
limiting
their
area
of
operation.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
other
than
rule
11
of
the
reorganization
act
and
of
the
rule
5
of
that
particular
congress
that
passed
this
resolution
as
previously
been
questioned
here
in
watkins
and
barenblatt
which
generally
described
their
authority
to
investigate
communist
propaganda.
there
was
no
other
specifying
of
a
more
limited
area
of
inquiry.
this
is
the
reason
i
mentioned
that
the
committee
didn't
just
meet
in
three
minutes
and
go
on.
they
were
in
session
on
each
occasion
more
than
an
hour
at
the
time
when
the
committee
was
set
up
and
the
time
when
the
hearing
was
continued.
that's
why
i
do
think
it's
pertinent
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
investigation
--
you
know
it's
by
act
by
congress,
it's
nonetheless
a
picking
up
of
where
they
left
off
in
the
previous
times.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no
it
is
not.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it's
a
permanent
committee,
but
congress
considerably
could
be
defeated
from
--
in
one
congress
that
has
--
therefore
not
--
in
one
election
not
be
back
to
be
on
the
committee
the
next
time.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
think
that
is
permissible
under
the
regulations
--
of
the
rules
of
this
committee.
the
january
23
resolutions
clearly
states
the
chairman
shall
have
the
power
to
appoint
such
committees
as
you've
described
and
have
a
full
authority
to
act
as
if
it
were
the
full
committee.
i
think
in
answer
to
that,
we
must
give
some
consideration
of
the
fact
that
the
members
of
this
committee
are
members
of
congress,
duly
elected
to
the
congress.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
my
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
run
a
committee
in
that
manner
myself,
would
not
advocating
that,
but
i
think
that
is
the
law.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
as
it
stands
now,
i
do
think
they
have
that
power.
i
think
that
the
courts
have
come
very
close
to
their
very
question
not
perhaps
and
the
record
is
silent
by
saying
in
watkins
for
example
that
when
it
doesn't
appear
in
advance,
what
the
subject
of
inquiry
is
the
court
may
look
to
the
opening
statement
and
i
believe
that
was
done
probably
because
the
real
question
is
has
the
witness
been
misled,
has
he
been
entered.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no,
i
would
say
that
was
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
first
section,
1955.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
oh!
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well
it
would
be
both.
the
indictment
alleges
--
is
that
what
you
mean?
what
does
the
indictment
alleges?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no,
they
didn't
--
i
misled
you
there.
the
february
9
meeting
of
the
committee
set
up
the
date
of
a
hearing
for
february
21.
the
february
21
meeting
never
convened.
there
was
no
hearing.
it
was
continued
by
the
counsels
of
the
committee
on
the
authority
of
the
chairman
to
february
28th
and
on
february
23rd
the
full
committee
had
its
meeting
to
confirm
the
chairman's
continuance
but
to
move
the
committee
--
subcommittee's
hearing
from
fort
wayne
to
washington.
and
then
on
february
28th,
after
those
two
you
might
say
organizing
meetings,
the
hearings
began
that
were
two
days
february
28th
and
march
1st.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
february
28th
and
march
1st
based
on
the
authority
of
the
january
20th,
february
9th
and
february
23rd
committee
meetings.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes
and
that
was
based
on
questions
asked
at
the
february
28th
and
29th
meeting.
mr.
gojack
was
the
third
witness
on
28th
and
it
continued
over
to
march
1
and
there
were
six
questions
in
the
indictment.
the
first
one
was
“are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
and
the
last
question
asked
of
him
on
march
1
likewise
related
to
that
they
asked
him
again
“are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
i
might
read
that
because
the
--
if
i
have
it.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
february
28th.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
just
february
28,
on
four
occasions
with
this
witness
and
another
occasion
with
the
other
witnesses
the
committee
members,
usually
the
chairman,
explained
to
the
witness
why
they
were
asking
the
questions
what
the
committee
was
trying
to
investigate.
ordinarily,
it
was
in
terms
of
investigating
communism
in
the
ue
or
in
labor.
these
are
spelled
out
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
correct,
that's
resolution
january
20th.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
all
of
these
resolutions
your
honor.
this
is
why
i
answered
the
chief
justice's
question
that
way.
as
i
understand
it,
the
authority
is
--
and
the
rule
as
it
now
spelled
out
would
permit
to
say
enough
of
--
from
a
nine-man,
three
committees
to
go
about
conducting
with
this
other
committee.
but
they
could
--
i
don't
believe
their
rules
permit
committees
of
one
anymore,
but
they
could
go
about,
say
have
committees
of
three.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
full
committee
authorized
both
the
21st
hearing
and
the
28th
hearing.
there
was
one
absent
at
one
meeting
and
they're
the
majority.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no
sir,
there's
nothing
in
the
motion.
there's
nothing
in
the
resolution
of
a
subject
such
as
communist
infiltration
of
labor
there
is
none.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
there's
no
formal
language
spelled
out
in
either
committee
actions
of
a
subject
under
inquiry
or
a
subject
to
be
investigated.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
is
not
dealt
with.
yes?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
there
--
the
reference
to
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
reference
to
the
documentation
of
this
particular
hearing
of
february
28th
and
march
1st,
there
is
no
language
in
the
resolution
dealing
with
the
subject
under
inquiry,
although
the
resolution
does
authorize
hearings
by
this
particular
subcommittee
in
fort
wayne
and
later
changed
to
washington
and
of
these
witnesses,
state
witnesses.
however
it
should
not
be
said,
those
not
in
the
record,
should
not
be
believed
that
there
was
never
a
resolution
authorizing
the
committee,
subcommittees
to
investigate
commerce
infiltration
and
labor
issue
alone.
this
is
not
in
the
record
i
must
say,
but
in
the
prior
hearings
that
the
committee
had
conducted,
not
all
and
i
can't
refer
to
which
one
would
[inaudible]
like
in
emspak,
in
watkins
--
or
it
wouldn't
have
been
in
watkins
i
don't
think,
deutch
and
back
in
one
of
those
--
one
or
more
of
those
earlier
hearings,
into
the
ue,
the
committee
had
agreed
on
their
majority
desire
to
pursue
an
investigation
of
congress
infiltration
and
to
labor
and
particularly
under
the
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
--
the
language
that
you
speak
of
mr.
justice
fortas
was
not
in
this
resolution.
the
committee,
as
the
record
will
show,
considered
this
not
a
major
investigation
being
initiated
as
the
rule
refers
to.
the
committee,
as
the
record
reflects,
considered
this
a
“hangover”
from
the
previous
year.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
was
in
relation
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well
mr.
justice
fortas
that
resolution
is
not
on
this
record.
i'm
sure
that
we
can
--
the
committee
could
locate
one
early
as
to
the
ue
investigation,
but
it
is
not
in
this
record.
the
committee
is,
it
appeared
in
a
newspaper
article,
they
considered
it
a
hangover,
a
cleaning
up.
it
appears
in
the
record
that
they
were
cleaning
up
some
leftover
witnesses
that
they
had
wanted
to
get
to
in
1953
and
1954
and
had
not
reached.
they
did
not
approach
it
this
manner
frankly
and
they
do
not
consider
the
initiation
of
a
major
investigation.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
haven't
checked
that.
i
think
it
was
substantially
the
same.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
but,
as
i
indicated
before,
they
do
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
no.
the
new
committee
could
change
it.
obviously
i
would
agree
they
could
come
in
and
say
“we'll
discontinue
this
investigation
and
we
will
have
no
more
of
this
type
or
we
will
initiate
one
in
a
different
area,”
it's
true.
each
congress
organizes
itself,
as
you
know
by
the
members
that
are
duly
elected
and
members
of
that
congress.
this
is
not
a
second
session
problem.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
presentation
by
petitioner's
counsel,
i
would
like
to
treat
at
the
outset
with
the
authorization
of
the
committee
and
to
show
that
the
procedures
followed
were
regular
and
was
called
for
by
rules
and
the
law,
and
to
contest
with
him
a
bit
on
seeger
and
lamont.
now
i
think
as
background,
it
is
germane
and
of
use,
to
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
this
committee
had
not
only
in
prior
years
but
in
the
preceding
year
conducted
investigations
of
communist
infiltration
into
labor
unions
particularly
into
the
united
electrical
and
radio,
machine
workers
of
which
this
man
was
a
member.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
mates
and
other
witness
subpoenaed
have
been
subpoenaed
at
a
previous
hearing
the
previous
year
and
--
but
did
not
appear
and
was
to
have
been
called
at
a
later
date.
the
committee's
investigation
in
this
union
brings
forth
subjects
not
unfamiliar
to
this
court
such
as
watkins
who
was
member
of
this
union,
deutch,
emspak
were
members
of
this
union
and
their
cases
have
gone
through
the
courts.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
deutch,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
in
the
ue,
and
they
were,
as
i
recall
it,
but
there
the
question
that
he
had
been
asked
was
relating
to
activity
at
cornell
and
the
--
apparently
the
authorization
there
was
for
the
purpose
was
investigation
of
communist
infiltration
on
the
labor
and
the
student's
point
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that's
right,
and
the
student
point
was
--
the
crucial
issue
there
was
underlain
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
so
when
the
full
committee,
i
believe
one
member
being
absent
in
that,
on
february
9,
1955
that
background
becomes
of
importance.
this
was
not
a
five-minute
meeting
where
they
just
appointed
a
subcommittee.
the
record
shows
that
it
lasted
an
hour
and
five
minutes
or
an
hour
and
a
quarter,
something
of
that
sort.
that
time,
a
motion
was
agreed
to,
that
provided
that
this
david
mates
and
john
gojack
should
be
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
subcommittee,
and
it
did
say
a
committee
on
internal
security
[inaudible]
in
open
hearing
at
in
fort
wayne,
indiana.
there's
the
authorization
from
the
full
committee
to
the
chairman
to
appoint
a
subcommittee
for
the
subcommittee
to
hold
a
hearing
and
it
states
the
city
in
which
it
is
to
be
held.
in
the
course
of
the
meeting
and
in
the
presence
of
the
others
the
chairman
designated
the
members
of
the
subcommittee
and
set
the
date
as
february
21.
later
on,
because
it
was
discovered
that
this
hearing
might
interfere
with
a
union
election
that
would
follow
by
three
days,
the
date
of
the
hearing
was
postponed
from
the
21st
to
the
28th.
this
was
done
by
the
committee
chairman
under
his
authority,
but
he
called
a
committee
meeting
thereafter
advised
them
of
the
continuance
of
the
hearing,
this
committee
meeting
was
held
on
the
23rd,
so
here
is
another
meeting
of
the
committee
about
the
hearings
in
fort
wayne.
however,
they
changed
the
place
of
the
hearings
in
view
of
the
change
of
date
from
fort
wayne
to
washington,
so
there
is
another
consideration.
the
committee
resolution
of
january
20th,
that
hasn't
been
mentioned,
authorized
the
chairman
to
appoint
subcommittees
to
act
and
carry
out
the
business
of
the
committee
--
full
committee
with
the
full
power
and
authority
of
a
full
committee.
when
the
committee
came
into
session
and
before
the
witnesses,
immediately
after
the
witness
were
sworn,
the
chairman
announced
the
purpose
of
the
investigation.
at
that
time
he
stated,
“there
will
be
considered
at
this
hearing
testimony
relating
to
communist
party
activities
within
the
field
of
labor.
the
methods
used
by
the
communist
party
to
infiltrate
labor
organizations,
and
the
dissemination
of
the
communist
party
propaganda.”
an
examination
of
the
record
will
disclose
that
the
questions
asked
not
only
to
this
witness,
but
to
the
other
witnesses
related
to
that
subject
matter.
i
believe
this
court
has
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes
that
is
the
first
advice
to
witnesses
as
to
the
scope
of
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
that
appears
in
the
record
other
than
the
course
that
the
indictment,
later
on
and
before
trial
the
indictment
alleged
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no,
no
not
before
that.
this
is
the
first
time
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
however
it
does
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well
other
than
newspaper
cuttings
or
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understood
your
question
chief
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes
indeed,
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
those
were
on
the
record,
i'm
sorry,
those
were
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
we're
dealing
with
the
record,
right.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
we
are
dealing
with
the
record.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no,
what
i
--
i
misstate
it.
what
i
intended
to
mention
was
that
prior
to
the
hearing,
the
washington
representative
of
the
union
had
come
to
the
committee
in
an
effort
to
get
discontinuance
and
they
had
had
discussions
that
an
investigation
of
this
nature,
i
admit
it
is
not
spelled
out,
would
interfere
with
the
election
to
be
held
three
days
after
the
hearings.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
the
nlrb
had
called
an
election
in
fort
wayne
in
which
there
are
other
unions
interested
and
the
chairman
had
not
known
of
this
apparently.
they
had
received
a
telegram
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
he
--
it's
in
the
records
mr.
chief
justice
i'm
not
sure
that
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
he
said
--
the
record
contains
testimony
as
to
the
meeting
with
the
washington
representative
for
this
reason.
the
congressman
made
this
meeting
an
official
meeting
of
the
committee
and
a
recorder
--
the
minutes
were
recorded
by
the
committee
reporter
as
to
what
was
said
by
the
congressman
and
was
said
by
i
believe
by
mr.
goldstein
regarding
the
request
for
a
postponement.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
some
questions
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
goldstein
would
testify
under
oath
that
there
was
an
election
coming
up,
because
the
chairman
apparently
did
not
know
of
it,
did
not
heard
of
it,
and
asked
him
to
put
it
on
the
record
of
the
committee.
shortly
prior
to
that
meeting,
the
chairman
had
received
a
telegram
on
february
10th,
i
believe,
from
the
petitioner
here,
vigorously
and
bitterly
protesting
the
hearings
and
making
reference
to
the
previous
congressman
thomas'
conviction
and
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
that
the
companies
were
behind
the
hearing
and
there
were
some
rather
strong
language
to
such
an
extent
that
there
were
some
strong
feelings
that
the
goldstein
meetings
later
on,
when
goldstein
came
in
and
wanted
a
continuance
because
of
an
election,
the
chairman
was
quite
dubious
that
there
was
such
an
election
apparently,
and
the
record
clearly,
clearly
reflects
that.
i
mention
this
to
show
that
although
the
opening
statement
of
the
chairman
that
the
first
time
that
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
was
formally
spelled
out
that
there
had
been
the
telegram
from
the
petitioner.
there
had
been
the
request
from
mr.
goldstein,
the
washington
representative,
for
continuance
because
such
a
hearing
would
interfere
with
the
election.
on
that
occasion
that
continuance
or
postpone
was
not
granted.
subsequently,
the
then
counsel
of
petitioner
called
the
counsel
of
the
committee,
i
think
on
february
16th
and
satisfied
him
of
advisability
of
a
postponement
and
the
committee
counsel
reached
the
chairman
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
he
agreed
that
was
a
right
procedure.
now
the
petitioner
is
relying
on
this
matter
for
authority
on
lamont
and
seeger
cases.
incidentally,
perhaps
i
think
i
should
mention,
as
far
as
i
could
find
in
the
rules
of
the
committee
there
is
no
committee
rule
or
house
rule
that
requires
that
the
purpose
or
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
be
spelled
out
in
advance
in
a
committee
resolution
formally.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
not
done
in
watkins.
it
was
not
--
all
i
can
say
it
was
not
done
there,
i
don't
know.
but
my
point
is
that
it
had
been
done
in
prior
cases
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
court
may
look
to
other
parts
of
the
proceeding
to
determine
what
the
subject
on
their
inquiry
was
and
whether
the
petitioner
at
the
time
he
was
answering
the
questions
understood
the
pertinency
or
was
advised
of
it.
it's
true
it
must
be
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
subject
under
inquiry
mr.
justice?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
as
of
the
time
of
the
hearing,
it
would
be
the
opening
statement
of
the
chairman,
mr.
chief
justice
when
he
made
the
statement
that
i've
just
read
to
you.
later
on
the
petitioner
was
advised
by
the
chairman
and
the
counsel
and
other
members
of
the
committee
on
at
least
four
occasions
of
the
committee's
interest
in
determining
his
party
membership
whether
he
is
now
a
party
member
for
the
reasons
of
the
committee's
interest
in
communist
infiltration
under
the
labor
field.
the
petitioner,
i
believe
i
should
get
back
to
these
two
cases
or
i'll
miss
them,
the
lamont
case
was
i'm
sure
--
as
the
court
recalls
was
before
the
committee
on
government
operations.
the
resolution
there
authorized
the
committee
to
conduct
investigations
into
matters
of
budget,
the
efficiency
and
economy
of
the
government.
the
questions
asked
of
the
witness
however
dealt
with
matters
of
subversion
and
the
court
of
course
said
that
a
pleading
of
the
authority
of
the
committee
did
not
plead
them
authority
to
ask
questions
on
subversions
and
now
there's
no
linking
up
in
any
manner
on
the
question
of
subversion
to
an
authorization
to
investigate
for
budget,
economy
or
efficiency.
in
the
seeger
case,
which
also
dealt
with
the
authority
to
the
committee
and
the
allegation
of
authority
and
indictment,
what
happened
there
was
that
the
resolution
that
was
alleged
an
indictment
that
the
committee
conduct
an
investigation
was
in
fact
a
resolution
that
the
clerk
conduct
an
investigation.
there
had
been
another
resolution
adopted
regarding
the
appointment
of
a
subcommittee
and
that
it
should
hold
hearings.
that
resolution
not
only
was
not
plead
in
the
indictment,
it
was
not
submitted
in
answer
to
a
bill
of
particulars.
i
think
that
there's
reason
to
feel
in
the
case
that
the
committee
itself
couldn't
find
the
resolution
for
this.
but
in
any
event,
the
result
was
not
only
was
the
authorized
resolution
not
plead
in
the
indictment,
but
in
each
case,
the
witness
was
misled.
the
witness
was
misled
in
lamont
by
the
nature
of
the
resolution
and
the
witness
was
misled
in
seeger
by
the
fact
that
the
resolution
that
actually
authorized
the
subcommittee
was
not
plead
at
all.
they
plead
a
resolution
apparently
inadvertently
that
authorized
the
clerk
to
make
the
investigation.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
there
is
no
formal
statement
in
the
committee
resolution
to
the
subcommittee
of
the
subject
of
the
inquiry.
is
that
what
you
have
in
mind
mr.
justice
fortas?
i
should
observe
there,
however,
that
as
far
as
i
recall
there
has
been
no
decision
of
this
court,
and
i
don't
believe
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry,
of
the
subject
under
inquiry
must
be
spelled
out
formally
in
a
resolution
of
the
committee.
there's
no
rule
of
the
house
to
my
knowledge
that
requires
that
in
the
course
in
discussing
this
problem
in
other
cases.
i'm
talking
about
whether
the
witness
understood
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry
and
i
think
that
is
the
real
problem.
it
has
said
that
they
may
look
to
the
opening
statement
when
there's
nothing
else
and
if
that
can
satisfy
it.
i
think
the
crux
of
the
question
might
well
be,
was
the
witness
misled?
did
the
witness
understand
what
the
subject
of
inquiry
was?
was
he
advised
of
it
at
the
time?
he
came
in
before
he
was
sworn,
before
he
testified,
and
his
counsel
in
his
behalf
and
in
behalf
of
the
two
witnesses
that
preceded
him
filed
a
rather
lengthy
motion
moving
that
the
subpoenas
be
vacated
and
challenging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee.
this
rather
well
thought
out
motion
and
detailed
motion
did
not
raise
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
committee
in
any
manner
and
i
think
it
is
worthy
to
note
that
in
the
bill
of
particulars
that
was
later
filed,
petitioner
didn't
seem
to
have
been
misled
by
this
at
all
at
that
point
because
he
didn't
ask
anything
of
this
nature
in
the
bill
of
particulars.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
--
that
poses
a
different
situation
i
think
that
might
have
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it
strikes
me
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
committee
of
three
and
its
method
of
operation
and
function
of
the
chairman
is
somewhat
different
than
a
subcommittee
of
one.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no
i
don't
think
that
should
be
done
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
position
either
of
the
government
or
the
committee,
but
if
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
such
a
ways
to
concede
that
it
is
done
or
has
been
done
because
i
don't
think
it
has
been
done
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
proper
i
agree
with
you
on
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
there
is
no
formal
language
in
any
resolution
limiting
their
area
of
operation.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
other
than
rule
11
of
the
reorganization
act
and
of
the
rule
5
of
that
particular
congress
that
passed
this
resolution
as
previously
been
questioned
here
in
watkins
and
barenblatt
which
generally
described
their
authority
to
investigate
communist
propaganda.
there
was
no
other
specifying
of
a
more
limited
area
of
inquiry.
this
is
the
reason
i
mentioned
that
the
committee
didn't
just
meet
in
three
minutes
and
go
on.
they
were
in
session
on
each
occasion
more
than
an
hour
at
the
time
when
the
committee
was
set
up
and
the
time
when
the
hearing
was
continued.
that's
why
i
do
think
it's
pertinent
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
investigation
--
you
know
it's
by
act
by
congress,
it's
nonetheless
a
picking
up
of
where
they
left
off
in
the
previous
times.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no
it
is
not.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it's
a
permanent
committee,
but
congress
considerably
could
be
defeated
from
--
in
one
congress
that
has
--
therefore
not
--
in
one
election
not
be
back
to
be
on
the
committee
the
next
time.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
think
that
is
permissible
under
the
regulations
--
of
the
rules
of
this
committee.
the
january
23
resolutions
clearly
states
the
chairman
shall
have
the
power
to
appoint
such
committees
as
you've
described
and
have
a
full
authority
to
act
as
if
it
were
the
full
committee.
i
think
in
answer
to
that,
we
must
give
some
consideration
of
the
fact
that
the
members
of
this
committee
are
members
of
congress,
duly
elected
to
the
congress.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
my
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
run
a
committee
in
that
manner
myself,
would
not
advocating
that,
but
i
think
that
is
the
law.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
as
it
stands
now,
i
do
think
they
have
that
power.
i
think
that
the
courts
have
come
very
close
to
their
very
question
not
perhaps
and
the
record
is
silent
by
saying
in
watkins
for
example
that
when
it
doesn't
appear
in
advance,
what
the
subject
of
inquiry
is
the
court
may
look
to
the
opening
statement
and
i
believe
that
was
done
probably
because
the
real
question
is
has
the
witness
been
misled,
has
he
been
entered.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no,
i
would
say
that
was
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
first
section,
1955.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
oh!
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well
it
would
be
both.
the
indictment
alleges
--
is
that
what
you
mean?
what
does
the
indictment
alleges?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no,
they
didn't
--
i
misled
you
there.
the
february
9
meeting
of
the
committee
set
up
the
date
of
a
hearing
for
february
21.
the
february
21
meeting
never
convened.
there
was
no
hearing.
it
was
continued
by
the
counsels
of
the
committee
on
the
authority
of
the
chairman
to
february
28th
and
on
february
23rd
the
full
committee
had
its
meeting
to
confirm
the
chairman's
continuance
but
to
move
the
committee
--
subcommittee's
hearing
from
fort
wayne
to
washington.
and
then
on
february
28th,
after
those
two
you
might
say
organizing
meetings,
the
hearings
began
that
were
two
days
february
28th
and
march
1st.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
february
28th
and
march
1st
based
on
the
authority
of
the
january
20th,
february
9th
and
february
23rd
committee
meetings.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes
and
that
was
based
on
questions
asked
at
the
february
28th
and
29th
meeting.
mr.
gojack
was
the
third
witness
on
28th
and
it
continued
over
to
march
1
and
there
were
six
questions
in
the
indictment.
the
first
one
was
“are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
and
the
last
question
asked
of
him
on
march
1
likewise
related
to
that
they
asked
him
again
“are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
i
might
read
that
because
the
--
if
i
have
it.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
february
28th.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
just
february
28,
on
four
occasions
with
this
witness
and
another
occasion
with
the
other
witnesses
the
committee
members,
usually
the
chairman,
explained
to
the
witness
why
they
were
asking
the
questions
what
the
committee
was
trying
to
investigate.
ordinarily,
it
was
in
terms
of
investigating
communism
in
the
ue
or
in
labor.
these
are
spelled
out
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
correct,
that's
resolution
january
20th.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
all
of
these
resolutions
your
honor.
this
is
why
i
answered
the
chief
justice's
question
that
way.
as
i
understand
it,
the
authority
is
--
and
the
rule
as
it
now
spelled
out
would
permit
to
say
enough
of
--
from
a
nine-man,
three
committees
to
go
about
conducting
with
this
other
committee.
but
they
could
--
i
don't
believe
their
rules
permit
committees
of
one
anymore,
but
they
could
go
about,
say
have
committees
of
three.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
full
committee
authorized
both
the
21st
hearing
and
the
28th
hearing.
there
was
one
absent
at
one
meeting
and
they're
the
majority.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no
sir,
there's
nothing
in
the
motion.
there's
nothing
in
the
resolution
of
a
subject
such
as
communist
infiltration
of
labor
there
is
none.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
there's
no
formal
language
spelled
out
in
either
committee
actions
of
a
subject
under
inquiry
or
a
subject
to
be
investigated.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
is
not
dealt
with.
yes?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
there
--
the
reference
to
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
reference
to
the
documentation
of
this
particular
hearing
of
february
28th
and
march
1st,
there
is
no
language
in
the
resolution
dealing
with
the
subject
under
inquiry,
although
the
resolution
does
authorize
hearings
by
this
particular
subcommittee
in
fort
wayne
and
later
changed
to
washington
and
of
these
witnesses,
state
witnesses.
however
it
should
not
be
said,
those
not
in
the
record,
should
not
be
believed
that
there
was
never
a
resolution
authorizing
the
committee,
subcommittees
to
investigate
commerce
infiltration
and
labor
issue
alone.
this
is
not
in
the
record
i
must
say,
but
in
the
prior
hearings
that
the
committee
had
conducted,
not
all
and
i
can't
refer
to
which
one
would
[inaudible]
like
in
emspak,
in
watkins
--
or
it
wouldn't
have
been
in
watkins
i
don't
think,
deutch
and
back
in
one
of
those
--
one
or
more
of
those
earlier
hearings,
into
the
ue,
the
committee
had
agreed
on
their
majority
desire
to
pursue
an
investigation
of
congress
infiltration
and
to
labor
and
particularly
under
the
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
--
the
language
that
you
speak
of
mr.
justice
fortas
was
not
in
this
resolution.
the
committee,
as
the
record
will
show,
considered
this
not
a
major
investigation
being
initiated
as
the
rule
refers
to.
the
committee,
as
the
record
reflects,
considered
this
a
“hangover”
from
the
previous
year.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
was
in
relation
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well
mr.
justice
fortas
that
resolution
is
not
on
this
record.
i'm
sure
that
we
can
--
the
committee
could
locate
one
early
as
to
the
ue
investigation,
but
it
is
not
in
this
record.
the
committee
is,
it
appeared
in
a
newspaper
article,
they
considered
it
a
hangover,
a
cleaning
up.
it
appears
in
the
record
that
they
were
cleaning
up
some
leftover
witnesses
that
they
had
wanted
to
get
to
in
1953
and
1954
and
had
not
reached.
they
did
not
approach
it
this
manner
frankly
and
they
do
not
consider
the
initiation
of
a
major
investigation.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
haven't
checked
that.
i
think
it
was
substantially
the
same.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
but,
as
i
indicated
before,
they
do
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
no.
the
new
committee
could
change
it.
obviously
i
would
agree
they
could
come
in
and
say
“we'll
discontinue
this
investigation
and
we
will
have
no
more
of
this
type
or
we
will
initiate
one
in
a
different
area,”
it's
true.
each
congress
organizes
itself,
as
you
know
by
the
members
that
are
duly
elected
and
members
of
that
congress.
this
is
not
a
second
session
problem.
