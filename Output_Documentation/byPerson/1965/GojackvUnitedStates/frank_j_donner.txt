mr.
frank
j.
donner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
seeks
review
of
a
conviction
for
contempt
of
congress
under
title
2,
section
192
of
the
code.
the
congressional
committee
involved
is
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
petitioner
appeared
before
the
house
committee
early
in
1955.
the
case
was
here
before.
in
the
russell
case,
the
court
dismissed
the
indictment
in
this
case
and
in
five
others
on
the
ground
that
the
indictments
failed
to
state
the
matter
onto
inquiry.
it
subsequently
reversed
convictions
in
two
additional
cases
on
that
ground.
i
believe
this
is
all
of
those
indicted
--
all
of
those
reversed
convictions
were
subsequently
re-indicted
and
i
believe
this
is
the
sole
surviving
case.
the
others
having
been
dismissed
either
at
the
trial
or
appellate
level.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
having
been
dismissed
either
at
the
trial
or
appellate
level.
the
indictment
--
our
first
contention
here
your
honor
is
that
the
indictment
is
insufficient
because
it
lacks
the
specification
of
authority
by
the
subcommittee
involved
to
make
the
investigation
here
at
issue.
this
contention
has
two
ingredients.
first
the
fact
of
authorization
to
make
the
investigation
which
is
a
condition
of
competence
and
second,
the
details
of
the
authorization
which
is
a
condition
of
pertinence.
the
indictment
states
that
the
subject
of
the
hearings
was
communist
party
activities
in
the
field
of
labor,
and
that
this
was
a
question
within
the
authority
of
the
committee,
but
it
does
not
state
that
this
subject
was
delegated
to
the
subcommittee
by
the
full
committee.
the
following
sources
of
authority
are
listed
in
the
indictment
for
the
hearing.
first
the
legislative
reorganization
act
which
is
a
full
description
of
the
entire
committee's
authority.
second,
the
house
resolution
5
which
is
the
implementation
of
the
84th
congress
of
the
full
authority
of
the
committee.
third,
an
action
of
the
committee
appointing
a
subcommittee
but
not
designating
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
appointed.
fourth,
a
resolution
of
january
20th,
1955
about
a
month
before
this
hearing
took
place,
granting
the
chairman
authority
who
appoints
subcommittees
to
cover
whatever
the
committee
itself
could
investigate
and
fifth,
the
grant
of
a
continuance
of
a
hearing
from
february
8th
to
february
28th
again
without
any
statement
of
the
subject
committed
to
the
subcommittee.
it
appears,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
this,
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
as
referred
to
in
the
indictment
is
merely
the
subcommittee
chairman's
announcement
at
the
hearing
at
which
petitioner
appeared.
finally,
i
should
also
point
out
that
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
indictment
that
the
subcommittee
itself
decided
to
undertake
this
investigation.
in
the
lamont
case,
chief
justice
clark
--
chief
judge
clark
held
that
the
indictment
under
section
192
involving
a
subcommittee
must
allege
the
authority
of
a
subcommittee
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
subject
claimed
to
be
under
inquiry.
and
that
conversely,
a
reliance
on
the
authority
to
the
parent
committee
was
insufficient
to
show
competence.
judge
clark
added
that
and
i
quote
now.
“the
result
might
well
be
different
were
this
a
case
of
a
committee
created
by
congress
to
hold
hearings
for
a
specific
purpose,
with
the
inquiry
in
question
apparently
falling
within
the
assigned
purpose”
and
there
is
a
cf
citation
to
the
josephson
case
and
the
josephson
case
of
course
did
involve
a
house
committee
hearing.
the
lamont
case
involved
a
permanent
--
the
permanent
investigation
subcommittee
of
the
senate
committee
on
government
operations.
it
was
followed
in
the
second
circuit
by
the
seeger
case,
which
was
decided
three
days
before
this
court
decided
russell
and
it
ruled
that
a
much
more
explicit
indictment
than
is
present
here
was
defective
because
it
had
failed
properly
to
allege
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
to
conduct
the
hearings
in
issue.
the
court
upheld
this
contention
despite
the
fact
that
the
indictment
recited
the
fact,
and
i
quote,
“the
full
committee
had
directed
that
an
investigation
be
conducted
of
communist
infiltration
in
the
fields
of
labor.”
the
seeger
court's
decision
rests
both
on
the
grounds
of
competence
and
pertinence,
that
is,
it
construed
the
pertinency
provisions
of
section
192
to
require
that
the
question
under
inquiry
as
authorized
be
pleaded.
judge
moore
concurred
in
the
result
because
he
felt,
i
believe,
that
the
josephson
case
was
controlling,
but
he
said
despite
the
fact
that
the
government
proved
that
a
clerk
had
directed
that
the
--
an
investigation
be
conducted
of
communist
infiltration,
there
was
no
proof
of
a
resolution
by
the
committee.
the
majority
on
the
court
distinguished
josephson
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
had
not
been
raised
there
and
that
the
challenge
to
the
adequacy
of
the
indictment
was
based
on
other
grounds.
the
court
also
distinguished
the
sacher
case
which
is
relied
on
here
by
the
government,
that
is
the
seeger
court,
first
on
the
ground
that
the
court
in
sacher,
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
had
ignored
the
rationale
of
the
lamont
case,
and
second
on
the
ground
that
the
court
there
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
impact
on
sacher
of
the
remand
in
the
watkins
case
and
really
did
not
directly
come
to
grips
with
this
issue.
in
my
brief
at
pages
44
to
45,
i
distinguish
the
sacher
case
on
two
additional
grounds,
but
i
don't
want
to
go
into
it
here.
i
want
to
get
on
with
my
further
argument
about
assuming
this
seeger-lamont
view
is
correct,
the
question
then
arises
whether
a
committee
is
required
when
an
investigation
is
conducted,
narrower
in
scope
than
the
full
range
of
the
committee's
power
to
designate
for
itself
through
a
resolution
or
a
motion
the
subject
under
inquiry.
or
whether
conversely
a
subcommittee
can
on
its
own
decide
(a)
that
an
investigation
is
to
be
conducted,
(b)
construe
the
rule
11
that
is
the
authorizing
resolution
as
to
what
it
means,
(c)
decides
that
a
legislative
purpose
would
be
served,
(d)
decide
that
the
facts
already
existing
were
inadequate.
now
that
really
is
the
nub
of
the
case
in
my
view,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
unthinkable
to
hold
that
a
subcommittee
of
the
house
on
un-american
activities
committee
could
on
its
own
under
a
blanket
investigation
decide
all
of
these
questions
and
i
think
a
useful
place
to
start
would
be
the
legislative
reorganization
act
and
system
of
controls
which
had
been
erected
on
it,
which
are
in
many
ways
very
admirable.
since
the
legislative
reorganization
act
was
passed,
legislative
investigations
with
the
a
subpoena
power,
and
that
is
the
great
war
shed
as
it
were
in
this
field
it
seems
to
me,
what
happens
when
the
subpoena
power
is
invoked?
legislative
investigations
with
a
subpoena
power
are
either
directly
authorized
by
congress
with
a
limited
and
clearly
defined
subject
matter
and
duration,
the
so-called
special
investigations
or
indirectly
through
a
standing
committee
but
similarly
limited
as
to
subject
and
duration.
the
jurisdiction
of
standing
committees
is
too
broad
and
general,
agriculture,
armed
services,
judiciary,
to
support
the
use
of
subpoena
power
without
further
refinement
and
delegation.
thus
every
investigation
is
ultimately
a
special
investigation
in
the
sense
that
whatever
the
immediate
source
of
its
authority,
congress
or
a
parent
standing
committee,
it
has
a
clearly
defined
subject
matter
and
a
duration
authoritatively
fixed
by
the
parent
body
in
each
case.
now
the
house
committee
is
in
many
ways
a
sport.
it
began
as
a
special
committee,
but
there
can
no
doubt
that
it
shares
in
most
important
particulars,
this
characteristic
of
a
standing
committee.
and
moreover,
it
is
not
only
a
standing
committee
with
an
area
jurisdiction
in
the
standing
committee
sense
rather
than
a
limited
subject
jurisdiction,
but
its
charter
is
too
vague
to
support
the
use
of
a
subpoena
power
in
any
event.
in
other
words,
it's
not
only
general
like
agriculture,
but
it's
vague
like
un-american.
thus,
the
committee
does
not
and
could
not
use
compulsory
process
to
probe,
and
i'm
quoting
the
rule,
“the
extent,
character
and
objects
of
un-american
propaganda
activities
in
the
united
states
or
the
diffusion
with
the
united
states
of
subversive
and
un-american
propaganda.”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
point
out
on
my
brief,
the
committee
has
completely
redefined
its
resolution
to
eliminate
the
word
propaganda
from
it
altogether.
the
committee
construes
its
charter
then
none
of
them
ad
hoc
assignment,
you
can't
find
one
investigation
in
the
20
years
that
the
committee
has
been
in
existence
as
the
standing
committee
into
the
literal
terms
of
its
rule.
it
construes
its
charter
not
as
an
ad
hoc
assignment,
but
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
a
broad
area.
indeed
an
area
almost
without
boundaries,
segments
of
which
are
interpreted
by
the
committee
and
then
probed
piecemeal.
on
the
face
of
it,
turning
to
our
case,
communist
activities
in
the
field
of
labor,
communist
party
activities,
is
a
subject
not
even
mentioned
in
rule
11
and
obviously
required
an
initial
construction
and
delegation
before
the
committee's
agent,
the
subcommittee,
could
proceed.
now
the
characteristic
modus
operandi
of
the
committee
is
to
choose
by
resolution
or
motion
a
particular
subject
and
assign
a
committee
to
investigate.
in
my
brief
at
page
37,
i
have
assembled
some
samples
of
hearings
where
these
resolutions
are
recited
and
i
would
like
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court
just
to
read
one
of
them,
the
type
of
resolution
which
typically
triggers
a
committee
investigation.
“be
it
resolved,”
this
is
a
committee
resolution
in
connection
with
the
hearings
in
newark,
new
jersey
in
1958,
“be
it
resolved
that
a
hearing
by
the
committee
or
a
subcommittee
thereof
to
be
held
in
newark,
new
jersey
or
such
other
place
or
places
that
the
chairman
may
designate
on
such
date
or
dates
that
the
chairman
may
determine,
be
authorized
and
approved
including
the
conduct
of
investigation
deemed
reasonably
necessary
by
the
staff
in
preparation
therefore,
relating
to
the
following
subjects
and
having
the
legislative
purposes
indicated.”
now,
these
resolutions
accomplish
at
least
three
things
in
the
committee's
internal
housekeeping.
first
they
assign
a
subcommittee
a
subject
matter,
second
they
register
the
approval
of
the
committee
for
the
investigation,
and
i
will
have
occasion
in
my
next
point
to
discuss
the
violation
of
rule
1
of
the
committee
which
requires
approval
of
the
committee
of
every
major
investigation
and
third,
these
resolutions
designate
the
legislative
purposes
which
the
hearing
is
to
be
conducted.
now
i
suggest
that
this
practice
is
not
optional
for
it's
required
by
law
and
i
suggest
this
because
first
only
the
committee
can
authorize
an
investigation.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
almost
obvious.
second,
only
the
committee
can
construe
its
own
rule.
certainly
an
agent
of
the
committee,
a
subcommittee
which
is
not
even
an
agent
of
congress,
but
an
agent
of
the
committee
is
never
elected
by
congress,
hence
construe
the
meaning
of
rule
11,
that's
a
job
for
the
committee
at
the
first
instance.
third,
the
committee
must
determine
whether
a
legislative
purpose
would
be
served
by
holding
a
particular
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
true
that
this
is
self-evident
and
i
think
that
because
the
committee
didn't
do
that
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
a
statute
covering
the
precise
area
which
was
supposedly
under
investigation
here
communist
party
activities
in
the
field
of
labor.
exact
statute
was
passed
some
six
months
before
this
hearing
took
place,
that's
the
communist
infiltration
act
of
1954.
now
the
committee
--
if
the
committee
were
really
making
a
deliberate
judgment
on
the
need
--
the
legislative
need,
the
legislative
purpose
for
this
investigation,
if
it
was
singling
out
some
evil
in
a
deliberate
considered
way
which
required
legislative
therapy,
one
very
much
doubts
whether
it
would've
chosen
this
already
legislatively
exhausted
subject.
finally,
the
committee
must
decide
whether
the
facts
are
needed.
now,
there
is
one
other
consideration
which
seems
to
me
to
point
to
the
necessity
of
a
committee
determination
and
that
is
the
court's
ruling
in
the
watkins
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
watkins
ruling
can
almost
be
distilled
to
say
that
where
first
amendment
freedoms
are
involved
in
a
probe,
these
four
responsibilities
that
i've
just
been
talking
about
for
authorization,
construction,
legislative
purpose
and
fact
gathering
and
i
could
--
there
quotations
in
the
decision
which
justify
what
i'm
about
to
say
for
each
of
these
areas.
that
these
four
areas,
when
the
first
amendment
is
involved,
create
responsibilities
which
much
--
must
be
lodged
as
close
as
possible
to
the
source
of
power.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
watkins
decision
says
that
we
must
present,
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“the
separation
of
power
and
responsibility”
in
first
amendment
cases
particularly
and
it
seems
to
me
also
that
that
almost
requires
the
kind
of
result
that
i'm
arguing
for
here.
now,
your
honors
will
recall
that
i
stated
at
the
outset
that
this
argument
has
two
parts.
i've
dealt
--
i'm
dealing
up
till
now
with
the
question
of
competence.
i
want
to
deal
now
with
the
question
of
pertinence.
preliminary,
let
me
say
that
i
think
that
outside
of
the
area
of
pertinence,
considered
truly
as
a
first
amendment
question,
the
committee
should
be
required
to
decide
that
the
need
for
the
facts
is
so
exigent
as
to
warrant
an
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
and
the
only
way
that
can
be
expressed
is
through
a
detailed
delegation
to
the
subcommittee
specifying
by
an
agent
of
congress
to
subordinating
and
compelling
demands
which
require
investigative
action.
now,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
russell
case
and
the
construction
of
the
russell
case.
this
court
held
in
russell
that
the
question
under
inquiry
for
purposes
of
section
192
pertinency
requirement
must
be
pleaded.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
requires
a
statement
of
the
matter
not
as
considered
merely
by
the
subcommittee
chairman
as
confided
by
the
subcommittee
to
--
as
confided
for
the
subcommittee
by
the
full
committee,
but
rather
a
statement,
an
original
statement
of
delegation
by
the
committee
chairman.
statutory
pertinency
as
opposed
to
due
process
pertinency
turns
on
the
relationship
of
the
unanswered
questions
to
the
authorized
question.
it
is
significant
i
think
that
in
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
cited
in
the
russell
case
where
the
inquiry
was
recited
in
the
indictment,
there
were
decisions
in
the
second,
sixth,
and
seventh
circuits,
the
question
that
was
contained
in
the
resolution
was
the
one
--
the
question
that
was
deemed
to
be
under
inquiry
for
purposes
of
the
pertinency
provisions
of
the
contempt
statute,
were
the
ones
delegated
by
the
full
committee.
that
was
true
in
the
yellin
case
and
the
davis
case
and
in
the
second
circuit
cases.
that
is,
in
every
instance
where
a
grand
jury
returns
an
indictment,
reciting
the
matter
under
inquiry,
they
recited
the
matter
as
stated
by
the
full
committee
in
a
delegation
to
the
subcommittee.
i
also
think
it's
of
some
interest
that
since
the
russell
case
and
under
the
compulsion
of
the
russell
case
there
have
been
at
least
five
indictments
in
the
district
of
columbia.
two
of
them
incidentally
by
the
same
grand
jury
that
indicted
petitioner
and
that
all
without
exception
recites
the
delegation
of
the
full
committee
to
the
subcommittee.
now
it's
interesting
to
trace
the
background
of
this
pertinency
requirement.
originally,
when
the
statute
was
passed
the
congressional
practice
was
to
launch
every
investigation
with
a
special
resolution.
in
other
words,
there
were
--
this
problem
never
arose
because
congress
itself
was
explicit
in
delegating
the
matter
under
inquiry
through
a
special
resolution
and
the
court
in
the
barry
case
simply
construes
the
statute,
the
1857
statute,
to
read
just
that
way.
they
say
that
the
pertinency
requirement
is
a
requirement
of
pertinency
to
the
matter
delegated
by
the
full
committee.
there
was
one
occasion
in
the
house
of
representatives
when
this
statute
was
construed
that
was
in
1955.
when
the
chairman
of
the
rules
committee,
howard
smith,
answered
a
question
in
connection
with
the
debate
that
was
introduced
--
that
was
conducted
in
the
house
with
respect
to
a
resolution
introduced
by
congressman
doyle
amending
a
house
rule
to
require
that
the
announcement
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
of
the
subject
--
under
--
to
require
some
announcement
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
of
the
subject
under
inquiry.
and
congressman
smith
was
asked
whether
this
announcement,
which
is
a
kind
of
announcement
we
have
in
this
case,
was
the
kind
of
announcement
which
would
serve
as
the
foundation
for
pertinency
for
purposes
of
the
contempt
statute
and
he
said,
“no,
it
was
not.”
that
the
statement
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee
at
the
hearing
which
would
be
made
pursuant
to
this
rule
was
not
the
statement
which
was
required
--
not
the
statement
of
pertinency
which
was
required
under
the
contempt
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
effect,
the
house
is
required
--
the
house
committee
is
required
in
order
to
comply
with
the
pertinency
provisions
of
the
contempt
statute
to
make
a
special
resolution
in
every
case
in
which
an
investigation
is
launched.
in
order
to
furnish
the
foundation
for
the
--
for
a
resolution
of
the
issue
of
pertinency,
there
must
be
an
authentic
detailing
of
the
question
under
inquiry.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
it
is
this
authorization,
this
special
delegation
which
is
the
charter
of
the
subcommittee
in
the
sense
of
rumely
case
it
must
be
created
by
the
committee
and
recited
in
the
indictment
not
only
for
the
reasons
of
competence,
pertinency,
and
free
speech
already
referred
to,
but
to
enable
a
court
and
defendant
to
determine
whether
the
committee
exceeds
its
jurisdiction
and
whether
the
subcommittee
acted
within
its
terms
of
reference.
now,
the
government's
answer
to
all
this
is
that
the
indictment
is
insufficient
because
--
it
is
sufficient,
forgive
me,
because
it
recited
that
the
committee
assigned
all
of
its
powers
to
the
subcommittee.
but
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
not
all
of
the
committee's
power
which
is
i
think
is
quite
clear
could
never
be
a
subject
under
inquiry,
but
the
relatively
narrow
subject
of
communist
activities
in
the
field
of
labor,
communist
party
activities,
a
subject
which
i
have
pointed
out
already
can't
even
be
extrapolated
so
to
speak,
can't
be
inferred
from
the
resolution
by
reading
it.
you
have
to
bring
to
it
some
special
kind
of
a
focus
in
order
to
--
you
have
to
--
in
other
words
this
is
an
area
where
in
order
to
specify
this
matter
under
inquiry,
some
construction
must
be
made
and
the
committee
had
to
do
it.
now,
i
want
to
turn
next
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
proof
of
delegation.
there
is
no
proof
at
all
in
this
record
this
the
subcommittee
was
authorized
to
conduct
the
matter
alleged
to
be
under
inquiry
and
in
order
to
conserve
my
time,
i'll
refer
you
to
the
brief
on
that
point
and
deal
with
my
third
point
which
is
the
question
of
the
rule.
i
think
the
yellin
case
holds
that
violations
by
the
committee
of
its
own
rules
precludes
a
conviction
for
contempt.
rule
1
of
the
committee
requires
that
no
major
investigation
shall
be
initiated
without
approval
of
a
majority
of
the
committee.
rule
11
of
the
house
rules
require
that
standing
committee
shall
keep
a
record
of
all
committee
actions.
now
the
entire
file
of
the
committee
was
introduced
in
evidence
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
this
rule
was
complied
despite
the
fact
that
it's
clearly
a
major
investigation
and
the
government
doesn't
dispute
that.
now,
the
rule
--
it's
a
simple
rule
designed
to
prevent
one-man
rule
to
be
redundant
and
to
prevent
partisanship
in
administration
of
the
investigatory
process
and
most
committees
have
such
rules.
it
is
a
modest
attempt,
again
to
refer
to
watkins,
to
prevent
the
separation
of
power
from
responsibility,
that
measure
of
added
care
which
you
spoke
of
mr.
chief
justice
in
that
case,
which
committee
should
be
required
to
engage
in
to
ensure
fairness.
now
government
claims
that
this
rule
was
complied
with
because
sometime
in
1949
or
1952,
either
one
i
don't
know
which,
the
committee
had
commenced
to
pursuit
of
the
union
on
which
petitioner
was
a
member
and
this
was
a
continuing
investigation.
now
your
honors,
i'm
appalled
with
this
contention,
because
in
american
investigative
practice,
we
don't
have
–
we
don't
have
continuing
investigations.
that
aside,
it's
confessing
that
we
have
a
kind
of
star
chamber
in
this
country
that
a
committee
can
use
a
subpoena
power
to
investigate
individuals
and
organizations
indefinitely
without
resort
to
the
conventional
controls
of
congress.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
points
out
very
sharply
the
fact
that
this
whole
investigation
was
governed
and
determined
only
by
the
available
supply
of
exposable
witnesses.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
entry
of
this
committee
in
this
case
was
a
decision
to
subpoena
the
petitioner.
not
a
statement
of
a
legislative
purpose
or
a
decision
to
subpoena
him.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
merits
of
why
this
argument
about
a
continuing
investigation
is
untenable.
in
the
first
place,
there's
no
proof
that
the
investigation
was
approved
even
back
in
1952.
in
the
second
place
the
very
purpose
of
the
rule
would
be
frustrated
if
an
approval
could
be
inferred
from
prior
investigation.
in
third
place,
approval
prior
to
the
84th
congress
could
not
activate
a
subsequent
investigation
because
the
house
is
not
a
continuing
body.
in
the
fourth
place,
the
committee
itself
was
not
constituted
until
the
beginning
of
the
84th
congress,
and
the
indictment
specifically
refers
to
the
committee
as
having
been
created
and
authorized
by
house
resolution
5
of
the
84th
congress.
in
the
sixth
place,
the
committee
itself
does
not
carry
over
investigations
from
one
congress
to
another
without
fresh
approval
through
a
new
authorizing
resolution.
and
at
page
37
of
my
brief,
i
refer
your
honors,
to
a
typical
resolution
in
which
an
expired
investigation
is
reinvigorated
in
a
new
congress
by
the
committee.
and
so
--
it
seems
to
me
that
not
only
is
this
contention
factually
and
legally
erroneous,
but
it
raises
an
enormously
important
question
of
due
process
and
principle.
because
in
effect
the
government
is
--
if
the
government's
position
prevails
here,
it
means
that
we
have
a
continuing
body
that
goes
from
congress
to
congress
invading
people's
freedoms
without
any
control
at
all,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
certainly
not
the
law
and
it's
certainly
not
the
intention
of
the
rule.
now
i
intended
to
discuss
also
something
that's
intimately
related
to
this
and
that's
the
pattern
of
exposure
in
this
case.
i
think
i
have
followed
with
fair
fidelity
the
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
in
this
area.
and
in
the
past
20
years,
there
has
never
been
a
case
which
so
graphically
illustrates
the
exposure
pattern
of
this
court
as
this
case
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
i
want
to
point
out
that
before
this
hearing
was
held
in
the
fall
of
1954,
congressman
walter
made
a
statement
that
the
accuracy
of
which
is
not
in
dispute.
he
said,
“i
intend
to
hold
bigger
and
better
exposure
hearings
in
which
i
am
going
to
show
that
people
with
red
ties
are
members
of
a
plot
and
let
the
community,
the
loyal
americans
who
worked
with
them,
do
the
rest
of
the
job.”
now
when
this
man
was
subpoenaed
on
two
occasions,
the
press
was
notified
once
before
the
subpoena
was
even
issued,
warning
the
chairman,
the
statement
that's
not
disputed
that
the
subpoena
would
be
issued,
and
once
before
it
was
served
on
second
occasion,
and
most
importantly,
the
press
was
told
in
a
quotation
again
which
is
not
disputed
that
the
committee
intended
to
show
that
the
petitioner
and
another
witness
were
card-carrying
communists,
which
are
ever
showed
by
the
way,
and
the
rest
is
up
to
the
community
of
rank
invitation
to
lynching.
and
it
seems
to
me
your
honor,
that
if
what
you
--
what
the
court
said
in
watkins
and
the
other
exposure
cases
is
not
to
be
reduced
to
a
mere
verbalism,
if
this
is
a
question
of
fact
that
can
be
established
in
a
case,
it
was
established
here.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
seeks
review
of
a
conviction
for
contempt
of
congress
under
title
2,
section
192
of
the
code.
the
congressional
committee
involved
is
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
petitioner
appeared
before
the
house
committee
early
in
1955.
the
case
was
here
before.
in
the
russell
case,
the
court
dismissed
the
indictment
in
this
case
and
in
five
others
on
the
ground
that
the
indictments
failed
to
state
the
matter
onto
inquiry.
it
subsequently
reversed
convictions
in
two
additional
cases
on
that
ground.
i
believe
this
is
all
of
those
indicted
--
all
of
those
reversed
convictions
were
subsequently
re-indicted
and
i
believe
this
is
the
sole
surviving
case.
the
others
having
been
dismissed
either
at
the
trial
or
appellate
level.
mr.
frank
j.
donner
having
been
dismissed
either
at
the
trial
or
appellate
level.
the
indictment
--
our
first
contention
here
your
honor
is
that
the
indictment
is
insufficient
because
it
lacks
the
specification
of
authority
by
the
subcommittee
involved
to
make
the
investigation
here
at
issue.
this
contention
has
two
ingredients.
first
the
fact
of
authorization
to
make
the
investigation
which
is
a
condition
of
competence
and
second,
the
details
of
the
authorization
which
is
a
condition
of
pertinence.
the
indictment
states
that
the
subject
of
the
hearings
was
communist
party
activities
in
the
field
of
labor,
and
that
this
was
a
question
within
the
authority
of
the
committee,
but
it
does
not
state
that
this
subject
was
delegated
to
the
subcommittee
by
the
full
committee.
the
following
sources
of
authority
are
listed
in
the
indictment
for
the
hearing.
first
the
legislative
reorganization
act
which
is
a
full
description
of
the
entire
committee's
authority.
second,
the
house
resolution
5
which
is
the
implementation
of
the
84th
congress
of
the
full
authority
of
the
committee.
third,
an
action
of
the
committee
appointing
a
subcommittee
but
not
designating
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
appointed.
fourth,
a
resolution
of
january
20th,
1955
about
a
month
before
this
hearing
took
place,
granting
the
chairman
authority
who
appoints
subcommittees
to
cover
whatever
the
committee
itself
could
investigate
and
fifth,
the
grant
of
a
continuance
of
a
hearing
from
february
8th
to
february
28th
again
without
any
statement
of
the
subject
committed
to
the
subcommittee.
it
appears,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
this,
that
the
subject
under
inquiry
as
referred
to
in
the
indictment
is
merely
the
subcommittee
chairman's
announcement
at
the
hearing
at
which
petitioner
appeared.
finally,
i
should
also
point
out
that
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
indictment
that
the
subcommittee
itself
decided
to
undertake
this
investigation.
in
the
lamont
case,
chief
justice
clark
--
chief
judge
clark
held
that
the
indictment
under
section
192
involving
a
subcommittee
must
allege
the
authority
of
a
subcommittee
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
subject
claimed
to
be
under
inquiry.
and
that
conversely,
a
reliance
on
the
authority
to
the
parent
committee
was
insufficient
to
show
competence.
judge
clark
added
that
and
i
quote
now.
“the
result
might
well
be
different
were
this
a
case
of
a
committee
created
by
congress
to
hold
hearings
for
a
specific
purpose,
with
the
inquiry
in
question
apparently
falling
within
the
assigned
purpose”
and
there
is
a
cf
citation
to
the
josephson
case
and
the
josephson
case
of
course
did
involve
a
house
committee
hearing.
the
lamont
case
involved
a
permanent
--
the
permanent
investigation
subcommittee
of
the
senate
committee
on
government
operations.
it
was
followed
in
the
second
circuit
by
the
seeger
case,
which
was
decided
three
days
before
this
court
decided
russell
and
it
ruled
that
a
much
more
explicit
indictment
than
is
present
here
was
defective
because
it
had
failed
properly
to
allege
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee
to
conduct
the
hearings
in
issue.
the
court
upheld
this
contention
despite
the
fact
that
the
indictment
recited
the
fact,
and
i
quote,
“the
full
committee
had
directed
that
an
investigation
be
conducted
of
communist
infiltration
in
the
fields
of
labor.”
the
seeger
court's
decision
rests
both
on
the
grounds
of
competence
and
pertinence,
that
is,
it
construed
the
pertinency
provisions
of
section
192
to
require
that
the
question
under
inquiry
as
authorized
be
pleaded.
judge
moore
concurred
in
the
result
because
he
felt,
i
believe,
that
the
josephson
case
was
controlling,
but
he
said
despite
the
fact
that
the
government
proved
that
a
clerk
had
directed
that
the
--
an
investigation
be
conducted
of
communist
infiltration,
there
was
no
proof
of
a
resolution
by
the
committee.
the
majority
on
the
court
distinguished
josephson
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
had
not
been
raised
there
and
that
the
challenge
to
the
adequacy
of
the
indictment
was
based
on
other
grounds.
the
court
also
distinguished
the
sacher
case
which
is
relied
on
here
by
the
government,
that
is
the
seeger
court,
first
on
the
ground
that
the
court
in
sacher,
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
had
ignored
the
rationale
of
the
lamont
case,
and
second
on
the
ground
that
the
court
there
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
impact
on
sacher
of
the
remand
in
the
watkins
case
and
really
did
not
directly
come
to
grips
with
this
issue.
in
my
brief
at
pages
44
to
45,
i
distinguish
the
sacher
case
on
two
additional
grounds,
but
i
don't
want
to
go
into
it
here.
i
want
to
get
on
with
my
further
argument
about
assuming
this
seeger-lamont
view
is
correct,
the
question
then
arises
whether
a
committee
is
required
when
an
investigation
is
conducted,
narrower
in
scope
than
the
full
range
of
the
committee's
power
to
designate
for
itself
through
a
resolution
or
a
motion
the
subject
under
inquiry.
or
whether
conversely
a
subcommittee
can
on
its
own
decide
(a)
that
an
investigation
is
to
be
conducted,
(b)
construe
the
rule
11
that
is
the
authorizing
resolution
as
to
what
it
means,
(c)
decides
that
a
legislative
purpose
would
be
served,
(d)
decide
that
the
facts
already
existing
were
inadequate.
now
that
really
is
the
nub
of
the
case
in
my
view,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
unthinkable
to
hold
that
a
subcommittee
of
the
house
on
un-american
activities
committee
could
on
its
own
under
a
blanket
investigation
decide
all
of
these
questions
and
i
think
a
useful
place
to
start
would
be
the
legislative
reorganization
act
and
system
of
controls
which
had
been
erected
on
it,
which
are
in
many
ways
very
admirable.
since
the
legislative
reorganization
act
was
passed,
legislative
investigations
with
the
a
subpoena
power,
and
that
is
the
great
war
shed
as
it
were
in
this
field
it
seems
to
me,
what
happens
when
the
subpoena
power
is
invoked?
legislative
investigations
with
a
subpoena
power
are
either
directly
authorized
by
congress
with
a
limited
and
clearly
defined
subject
matter
and
duration,
the
so-called
special
investigations
or
indirectly
through
a
standing
committee
but
similarly
limited
as
to
subject
and
duration.
the
jurisdiction
of
standing
committees
is
too
broad
and
general,
agriculture,
armed
services,
judiciary,
to
support
the
use
of
subpoena
power
without
further
refinement
and
delegation.
thus
every
investigation
is
ultimately
a
special
investigation
in
the
sense
that
whatever
the
immediate
source
of
its
authority,
congress
or
a
parent
standing
committee,
it
has
a
clearly
defined
subject
matter
and
a
duration
authoritatively
fixed
by
the
parent
body
in
each
case.
now
the
house
committee
is
in
many
ways
a
sport.
it
began
as
a
special
committee,
but
there
can
no
doubt
that
it
shares
in
most
important
particulars,
this
characteristic
of
a
standing
committee.
and
moreover,
it
is
not
only
a
standing
committee
with
an
area
jurisdiction
in
the
standing
committee
sense
rather
than
a
limited
subject
jurisdiction,
but
its
charter
is
too
vague
to
support
the
use
of
a
subpoena
power
in
any
event.
in
other
words,
it's
not
only
general
like
agriculture,
but
it's
vague
like
un-american.
thus,
the
committee
does
not
and
could
not
use
compulsory
process
to
probe,
and
i'm
quoting
the
rule,
“the
extent,
character
and
objects
of
un-american
propaganda
activities
in
the
united
states
or
the
diffusion
with
the
united
states
of
subversive
and
un-american
propaganda.”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
point
out
on
my
brief,
the
committee
has
completely
redefined
its
resolution
to
eliminate
the
word
propaganda
from
it
altogether.
the
committee
construes
its
charter
then
none
of
them
ad
hoc
assignment,
you
can't
find
one
investigation
in
the
20
years
that
the
committee
has
been
in
existence
as
the
standing
committee
into
the
literal
terms
of
its
rule.
it
construes
its
charter
not
as
an
ad
hoc
assignment,
but
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
a
broad
area.
indeed
an
area
almost
without
boundaries,
segments
of
which
are
interpreted
by
the
committee
and
then
probed
piecemeal.
on
the
face
of
it,
turning
to
our
case,
communist
activities
in
the
field
of
labor,
communist
party
activities,
is
a
subject
not
even
mentioned
in
rule
11
and
obviously
required
an
initial
construction
and
delegation
before
the
committee's
agent,
the
subcommittee,
could
proceed.
now
the
characteristic
modus
operandi
of
the
committee
is
to
choose
by
resolution
or
motion
a
particular
subject
and
assign
a
committee
to
investigate.
in
my
brief
at
page
37,
i
have
assembled
some
samples
of
hearings
where
these
resolutions
are
recited
and
i
would
like
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court
just
to
read
one
of
them,
the
type
of
resolution
which
typically
triggers
a
committee
investigation.
“be
it
resolved,”
this
is
a
committee
resolution
in
connection
with
the
hearings
in
newark,
new
jersey
in
1958,
“be
it
resolved
that
a
hearing
by
the
committee
or
a
subcommittee
thereof
to
be
held
in
newark,
new
jersey
or
such
other
place
or
places
that
the
chairman
may
designate
on
such
date
or
dates
that
the
chairman
may
determine,
be
authorized
and
approved
including
the
conduct
of
investigation
deemed
reasonably
necessary
by
the
staff
in
preparation
therefore,
relating
to
the
following
subjects
and
having
the
legislative
purposes
indicated.”
now,
these
resolutions
accomplish
at
least
three
things
in
the
committee's
internal
housekeeping.
first
they
assign
a
subcommittee
a
subject
matter,
second
they
register
the
approval
of
the
committee
for
the
investigation,
and
i
will
have
occasion
in
my
next
point
to
discuss
the
violation
of
rule
1
of
the
committee
which
requires
approval
of
the
committee
of
every
major
investigation
and
third,
these
resolutions
designate
the
legislative
purposes
which
the
hearing
is
to
be
conducted.
now
i
suggest
that
this
practice
is
not
optional
for
it's
required
by
law
and
i
suggest
this
because
first
only
the
committee
can
authorize
an
investigation.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
almost
obvious.
second,
only
the
committee
can
construe
its
own
rule.
certainly
an
agent
of
the
committee,
a
subcommittee
which
is
not
even
an
agent
of
congress,
but
an
agent
of
the
committee
is
never
elected
by
congress,
hence
construe
the
meaning
of
rule
11,
that's
a
job
for
the
committee
at
the
first
instance.
third,
the
committee
must
determine
whether
a
legislative
purpose
would
be
served
by
holding
a
particular
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
true
that
this
is
self-evident
and
i
think
that
because
the
committee
didn't
do
that
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
a
statute
covering
the
precise
area
which
was
supposedly
under
investigation
here
communist
party
activities
in
the
field
of
labor.
exact
statute
was
passed
some
six
months
before
this
hearing
took
place,
that's
the
communist
infiltration
act
of
1954.
now
the
committee
--
if
the
committee
were
really
making
a
deliberate
judgment
on
the
need
--
the
legislative
need,
the
legislative
purpose
for
this
investigation,
if
it
was
singling
out
some
evil
in
a
deliberate
considered
way
which
required
legislative
therapy,
one
very
much
doubts
whether
it
would've
chosen
this
already
legislatively
exhausted
subject.
finally,
the
committee
must
decide
whether
the
facts
are
needed.
now,
there
is
one
other
consideration
which
seems
to
me
to
point
to
the
necessity
of
a
committee
determination
and
that
is
the
court's
ruling
in
the
watkins
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
watkins
ruling
can
almost
be
distilled
to
say
that
where
first
amendment
freedoms
are
involved
in
a
probe,
these
four
responsibilities
that
i've
just
been
talking
about
for
authorization,
construction,
legislative
purpose
and
fact
gathering
and
i
could
--
there
quotations
in
the
decision
which
justify
what
i'm
about
to
say
for
each
of
these
areas.
that
these
four
areas,
when
the
first
amendment
is
involved,
create
responsibilities
which
much
--
must
be
lodged
as
close
as
possible
to
the
source
of
power.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
watkins
decision
says
that
we
must
present,
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“the
separation
of
power
and
responsibility”
in
first
amendment
cases
particularly
and
it
seems
to
me
also
that
that
almost
requires
the
kind
of
result
that
i'm
arguing
for
here.
now,
your
honors
will
recall
that
i
stated
at
the
outset
that
this
argument
has
two
parts.
i've
dealt
--
i'm
dealing
up
till
now
with
the
question
of
competence.
i
want
to
deal
now
with
the
question
of
pertinence.
preliminary,
let
me
say
that
i
think
that
outside
of
the
area
of
pertinence,
considered
truly
as
a
first
amendment
question,
the
committee
should
be
required
to
decide
that
the
need
for
the
facts
is
so
exigent
as
to
warrant
an
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
and
the
only
way
that
can
be
expressed
is
through
a
detailed
delegation
to
the
subcommittee
specifying
by
an
agent
of
congress
to
subordinating
and
compelling
demands
which
require
investigative
action.
now,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
russell
case
and
the
construction
of
the
russell
case.
this
court
held
in
russell
that
the
question
under
inquiry
for
purposes
of
section
192
pertinency
requirement
must
be
pleaded.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
requires
a
statement
of
the
matter
not
as
considered
merely
by
the
subcommittee
chairman
as
confided
by
the
subcommittee
to
--
as
confided
for
the
subcommittee
by
the
full
committee,
but
rather
a
statement,
an
original
statement
of
delegation
by
the
committee
chairman.
statutory
pertinency
as
opposed
to
due
process
pertinency
turns
on
the
relationship
of
the
unanswered
questions
to
the
authorized
question.
it
is
significant
i
think
that
in
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
cited
in
the
russell
case
where
the
inquiry
was
recited
in
the
indictment,
there
were
decisions
in
the
second,
sixth,
and
seventh
circuits,
the
question
that
was
contained
in
the
resolution
was
the
one
--
the
question
that
was
deemed
to
be
under
inquiry
for
purposes
of
the
pertinency
provisions
of
the
contempt
statute,
were
the
ones
delegated
by
the
full
committee.
that
was
true
in
the
yellin
case
and
the
davis
case
and
in
the
second
circuit
cases.
that
is,
in
every
instance
where
a
grand
jury
returns
an
indictment,
reciting
the
matter
under
inquiry,
they
recited
the
matter
as
stated
by
the
full
committee
in
a
delegation
to
the
subcommittee.
i
also
think
it's
of
some
interest
that
since
the
russell
case
and
under
the
compulsion
of
the
russell
case
there
have
been
at
least
five
indictments
in
the
district
of
columbia.
two
of
them
incidentally
by
the
same
grand
jury
that
indicted
petitioner
and
that
all
without
exception
recites
the
delegation
of
the
full
committee
to
the
subcommittee.
now
it's
interesting
to
trace
the
background
of
this
pertinency
requirement.
originally,
when
the
statute
was
passed
the
congressional
practice
was
to
launch
every
investigation
with
a
special
resolution.
in
other
words,
there
were
--
this
problem
never
arose
because
congress
itself
was
explicit
in
delegating
the
matter
under
inquiry
through
a
special
resolution
and
the
court
in
the
barry
case
simply
construes
the
statute,
the
1857
statute,
to
read
just
that
way.
they
say
that
the
pertinency
requirement
is
a
requirement
of
pertinency
to
the
matter
delegated
by
the
full
committee.
there
was
one
occasion
in
the
house
of
representatives
when
this
statute
was
construed
that
was
in
1955.
when
the
chairman
of
the
rules
committee,
howard
smith,
answered
a
question
in
connection
with
the
debate
that
was
introduced
--
that
was
conducted
in
the
house
with
respect
to
a
resolution
introduced
by
congressman
doyle
amending
a
house
rule
to
require
that
the
announcement
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
of
the
subject
--
under
--
to
require
some
announcement
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
of
the
subject
under
inquiry.
and
congressman
smith
was
asked
whether
this
announcement,
which
is
a
kind
of
announcement
we
have
in
this
case,
was
the
kind
of
announcement
which
would
serve
as
the
foundation
for
pertinency
for
purposes
of
the
contempt
statute
and
he
said,
“no,
it
was
not.”
that
the
statement
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee
at
the
hearing
which
would
be
made
pursuant
to
this
rule
was
not
the
statement
which
was
required
--
not
the
statement
of
pertinency
which
was
required
under
the
contempt
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
effect,
the
house
is
required
--
the
house
committee
is
required
in
order
to
comply
with
the
pertinency
provisions
of
the
contempt
statute
to
make
a
special
resolution
in
every
case
in
which
an
investigation
is
launched.
in
order
to
furnish
the
foundation
for
the
--
for
a
resolution
of
the
issue
of
pertinency,
there
must
be
an
authentic
detailing
of
the
question
under
inquiry.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
it
is
this
authorization,
this
special
delegation
which
is
the
charter
of
the
subcommittee
in
the
sense
of
rumely
case
it
must
be
created
by
the
committee
and
recited
in
the
indictment
not
only
for
the
reasons
of
competence,
pertinency,
and
free
speech
already
referred
to,
but
to
enable
a
court
and
defendant
to
determine
whether
the
committee
exceeds
its
jurisdiction
and
whether
the
subcommittee
acted
within
its
terms
of
reference.
now,
the
government's
answer
to
all
this
is
that
the
indictment
is
insufficient
because
--
it
is
sufficient,
forgive
me,
because
it
recited
that
the
committee
assigned
all
of
its
powers
to
the
subcommittee.
but
the
subject
under
inquiry
was
not
all
of
the
committee's
power
which
is
i
think
is
quite
clear
could
never
be
a
subject
under
inquiry,
but
the
relatively
narrow
subject
of
communist
activities
in
the
field
of
labor,
communist
party
activities,
a
subject
which
i
have
pointed
out
already
can't
even
be
extrapolated
so
to
speak,
can't
be
inferred
from
the
resolution
by
reading
it.
you
have
to
bring
to
it
some
special
kind
of
a
focus
in
order
to
--
you
have
to
--
in
other
words
this
is
an
area
where
in
order
to
specify
this
matter
under
inquiry,
some
construction
must
be
made
and
the
committee
had
to
do
it.
now,
i
want
to
turn
next
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
proof
of
delegation.
there
is
no
proof
at
all
in
this
record
this
the
subcommittee
was
authorized
to
conduct
the
matter
alleged
to
be
under
inquiry
and
in
order
to
conserve
my
time,
i'll
refer
you
to
the
brief
on
that
point
and
deal
with
my
third
point
which
is
the
question
of
the
rule.
i
think
the
yellin
case
holds
that
violations
by
the
committee
of
its
own
rules
precludes
a
conviction
for
contempt.
rule
1
of
the
committee
requires
that
no
major
investigation
shall
be
initiated
without
approval
of
a
majority
of
the
committee.
rule
11
of
the
house
rules
require
that
standing
committee
shall
keep
a
record
of
all
committee
actions.
now
the
entire
file
of
the
committee
was
introduced
in
evidence
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
this
rule
was
complied
despite
the
fact
that
it's
clearly
a
major
investigation
and
the
government
doesn't
dispute
that.
now,
the
rule
--
it's
a
simple
rule
designed
to
prevent
one-man
rule
to
be
redundant
and
to
prevent
partisanship
in
administration
of
the
investigatory
process
and
most
committees
have
such
rules.
it
is
a
modest
attempt,
again
to
refer
to
watkins,
to
prevent
the
separation
of
power
from
responsibility,
that
measure
of
added
care
which
you
spoke
of
mr.
chief
justice
in
that
case,
which
committee
should
be
required
to
engage
in
to
ensure
fairness.
now
government
claims
that
this
rule
was
complied
with
because
sometime
in
1949
or
1952,
either
one
i
don't
know
which,
the
committee
had
commenced
to
pursuit
of
the
union
on
which
petitioner
was
a
member
and
this
was
a
continuing
investigation.
now
your
honors,
i'm
appalled
with
this
contention,
because
in
american
investigative
practice,
we
don't
have
–
we
don't
have
continuing
investigations.
that
aside,
it's
confessing
that
we
have
a
kind
of
star
chamber
in
this
country
that
a
committee
can
use
a
subpoena
power
to
investigate
individuals
and
organizations
indefinitely
without
resort
to
the
conventional
controls
of
congress.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
points
out
very
sharply
the
fact
that
this
whole
investigation
was
governed
and
determined
only
by
the
available
supply
of
exposable
witnesses.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
entry
of
this
committee
in
this
case
was
a
decision
to
subpoena
the
petitioner.
not
a
statement
of
a
legislative
purpose
or
a
decision
to
subpoena
him.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
merits
of
why
this
argument
about
a
continuing
investigation
is
untenable.
in
the
first
place,
there's
no
proof
that
the
investigation
was
approved
even
back
in
1952.
in
the
second
place
the
very
purpose
of
the
rule
would
be
frustrated
if
an
approval
could
be
inferred
from
prior
investigation.
in
third
place,
approval
prior
to
the
84th
congress
could
not
activate
a
subsequent
investigation
because
the
house
is
not
a
continuing
body.
in
the
fourth
place,
the
committee
itself
was
not
constituted
until
the
beginning
of
the
84th
congress,
and
the
indictment
specifically
refers
to
the
committee
as
having
been
created
and
authorized
by
house
resolution
5
of
the
84th
congress.
in
the
sixth
place,
the
committee
itself
does
not
carry
over
investigations
from
one
congress
to
another
without
fresh
approval
through
a
new
authorizing
resolution.
and
at
page
37
of
my
brief,
i
refer
your
honors,
to
a
typical
resolution
in
which
an
expired
investigation
is
reinvigorated
in
a
new
congress
by
the
committee.
and
so
--
it
seems
to
me
that
not
only
is
this
contention
factually
and
legally
erroneous,
but
it
raises
an
enormously
important
question
of
due
process
and
principle.
because
in
effect
the
government
is
--
if
the
government's
position
prevails
here,
it
means
that
we
have
a
continuing
body
that
goes
from
congress
to
congress
invading
people's
freedoms
without
any
control
at
all,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
certainly
not
the
law
and
it's
certainly
not
the
intention
of
the
rule.
now
i
intended
to
discuss
also
something
that's
intimately
related
to
this
and
that's
the
pattern
of
exposure
in
this
case.
i
think
i
have
followed
with
fair
fidelity
the
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
in
this
area.
and
in
the
past
20
years,
there
has
never
been
a
case
which
so
graphically
illustrates
the
exposure
pattern
of
this
court
as
this
case
--
mr.
frank
j.
donner
i
want
to
point
out
that
before
this
hearing
was
held
in
the
fall
of
1954,
congressman
walter
made
a
statement
that
the
accuracy
of
which
is
not
in
dispute.
he
said,
“i
intend
to
hold
bigger
and
better
exposure
hearings
in
which
i
am
going
to
show
that
people
with
red
ties
are
members
of
a
plot
and
let
the
community,
the
loyal
americans
who
worked
with
them,
do
the
rest
of
the
job.”
now
when
this
man
was
subpoenaed
on
two
occasions,
the
press
was
notified
once
before
the
subpoena
was
even
issued,
warning
the
chairman,
the
statement
that's
not
disputed
that
the
subpoena
would
be
issued,
and
once
before
it
was
served
on
second
occasion,
and
most
importantly,
the
press
was
told
in
a
quotation
again
which
is
not
disputed
that
the
committee
intended
to
show
that
the
petitioner
and
another
witness
were
card-carrying
communists,
which
are
ever
showed
by
the
way,
and
the
rest
is
up
to
the
community
of
rank
invitation
to
lynching.
and
it
seems
to
me
your
honor,
that
if
what
you
--
what
the
court
said
in
watkins
and
the
other
exposure
cases
is
not
to
be
reduced
to
a
mere
verbalism,
if
this
is
a
question
of
fact
that
can
be
established
in
a
case,
it
was
established
here.
thank
you
your
honor.
