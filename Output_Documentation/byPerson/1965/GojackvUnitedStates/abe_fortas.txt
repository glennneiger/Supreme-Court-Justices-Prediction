justice

fortas
mr.
yeagley,
as
i
understand
your
adversary,
his
principal
thrust
of
the
argument
that
he
made
to
us
this
morning
is
that
the
fault
here
lies
in
the
delegation
without
specification
as
he
put
it
the
very
key
power
in
responsibility
together,
the
responsibility
being
vested
in
the
full
committee,
the
committee
--
the
full
committee
has
a
responsibility
of
specifically
delineating
the
authority
of
the
subcommittee.
now
just
assuming
for
the
moment
that
there's
something
to
that
argument,
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
was
a
specific
delineation
by
the
full
committee
of
the
subject
matter
that
this
subcommittee
was
supposed
to
investigate?
justice

justice

how
do
you
square
that
with
rule
1
of
the
committee's
rules
of
procedure
then?
now
rule
1
says,
what
your
adversary
relies
on,
no
major
investigation
shall
be
initiated
without
approval
of
the
majority
of
the
committee.
do
i
understand
that
you're
now
telling
us
that
on
no
occasion
was
there
action
by
majority
of
a
committee
to
initiate
an
investigation
either
in
terms
of
labor
unions
generally,
or
in
terms
of
this
union
in
particular?
justice

that
rule
is
on
page
48
of
your
adversary's
brief.
justice

well

really

justice
abe
fortas
i
really
don't
know,
you
said,
as
i
know
i
really
don't
know
that
your
adversary
in
his
argument
here
made
the
point
that
the
committee's
own
rules
require
that
there
be
approval
of
a
majority
of
the
committee
before
initiating
a
major
investigation.
now,
do
i
understand
you
to
tell
me
that
there's
nothing
before
us
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
majority
approval
of
the
committee
to
the
initiation
of
an
investigation
which
would
cover
the
investigation
in
issue
before
us?
that
is
--
i
assume
that
means
no
resolution
authorizing
initiation
of
an
investigation
of
labor
unions
or
this
specific
labor
union
or
this
specific
individual.
is
that
the
possible
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
was
there
--
i
mean,
a
resolution
whether
it's
hangover
or
not,
was
there
in
any
time
a
resolution
showing
compliance
with
rule
1
as
relating
to
this
particular
investigation?
justice
abe

never
mind
the
question
whenever
it
took
place
or
whatever
you
may
call
it
hangover
