justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
saying

an
average
person.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
difficulty
is
if
the
clergy
are
divided
on
this,
how
can
we
be
so
sure?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
there's
no

baptist
clergyman.

kept
it
in
his
home
and
his
14-year-old

you
say
a
typical
minister
would

be
one
who
would
find
this
to
be
obscene?
