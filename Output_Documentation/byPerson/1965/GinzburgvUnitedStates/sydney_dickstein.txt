mr.
sydney
dickstein
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
which
affirmed
petitioner's
convictions
for
mailing
three
publications
held
to
be
obscene.
petitioner
ginzburg
was
sentenced
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
fined
a
total
of
$28,000.
the
major
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
these
publications
are
obscene.
we
and
the
government
agree
that
in
order
for
a
work
to
be
obscene
it
must
be
without
redeeming
social
importance,
it
must
make
its
predominant
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
and
it
must
be
patently
offense.
we
say
that
none
of
the
elements
that
identify
obscenity
are
present
in
any
of
the
publications
in
this
case.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
no
your
honor,
it's
our
view
that
all
of
these
elements
must
coalesce
in
a
single
work
in
order
for
it
to
be
proscribable
obscenity.
as
to
the
element
of
redeeming
social
importance,
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
found
as
did
the
courts
of
appeal
--
court
of
appeals
that
none
of
these
publications
had
the
slightest
social
value,
had
any
redeeming
social
importance,
whatever.
here
in
this
court,
the
government
does
not
defend
those
findings.
it
admits
doubt
as
to
whether
eros
is
without
redeeming
social
importance.
it
concedes
that
the
major
portion
of
liaison
that
is
the
2.5
page
report
of
the
interview
with
the
well-known
psychologist,
dr.
albert
ellis
constitutes
serious
and
protected
advocacy.
and
so
rather
than
ask
this
court
to
conclude
that
these
works
are
without
redeeming
social
importance
when
considered
as
a
whole,
the
government
asked
the
court
to
dissect
these
two
publications,
article
by
article
and
consider
each
article
as
if
it
might
be
an
independent
obscene
work.
in
this
case,
the
door
was
closed
to
that
approach
before
the
trial
even
begun.
petitioners
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars
in
which
the
government
would
be
requested
to
state
whether
the
indictment
charge
that
the
alleged
nonmailable
material
was
obscene
when
considered
as
a
whole,
or
if
it
not
whether
part
or
parts
of
them
were
alleged
to
be
obscene
and
if
so,
to
state
which
parts.
now,
in
lieu
of
the
bill
of
particulars,
the
government
stipulated
that
the
indictment
charges
that
each
of
the
alleged
nonmailable
material
is
obscene
when
considered
as
a
whole.
and
when
we
consider
eros
and
liaison
as
a
whole,
we
think
it
clear
that
they
do
have
redeeming
social
importance
and
so
as
to
those
publications,
this
element
is
simply
not
present.
with
respect
to
the
third
work,
the
housewife's
handbook
on
selective
promiscuity,
here
too
the
government
says
that
the
lack
of
redeeming
importance
in
this
work
maybe
open
to
question
and
that
the
entire
issue
of
its
obscenity
is
a
matter
of
legitimate
debate,
that's
the
position
they
assert
here.
the
claims
for
redeeming
social
importance
of
the
handbook
were
three.
first,
as
a
true
author
biographical
account
of
a
woman
sexually
experienced
as
in
attitudes,
it
provided
needed
information.
secondly,
it
had
been
found
useful
or
reading
of
the
work
had
been
found
useful
to
some
people
particularly
women
whose
normal
sexual
drives
beset
them
with
feelings
of
guilt
and
anxiety.
here,
was
another
woman
talking
to
them
and
saying,
?this
is
the
way
i
feel.
you
are
not
alone
in
this
world.
you
need
not
live
solely
within
the
confines
of
your
own
mind.?
third,
the
handbook
has
much
social
commentary
and
advocate,
seriously
advocates
the
reshaping
of
society's
view
of
the
sexual
role
of
women.
the
government
says
that
the
handbook
may
have
the
values
claimed
for
it.
if
it
has
such
values,
we
recognize
that
it
comes
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
so
says
the
government,
but
they
had
a
restriction
here.
they
say
so
long
as
the
distribution
of
the
book
reflects
these
social
values
which
are
claimed
for
it.
now,
this
restriction,
this
appendage
to
redeeming
social
importance
that
the
government
adds
at
this
particular
point
of
the
litigation,
when
one
thinks
about
it,
i
think
it's
really
quite
frightening.
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
we
can
take
a
work
with
redeeming
social
importance
and
that
government
may
determine
by
occupational
and
educational
qualification
who
maybe
permitted
to
read
this
work
and
who
may
not
be
permitted
to
read
it.
if
there
were
such
a
statute
and
it
contained
the
authority
for
such
of
a
classification,
we
think
at
the
very
least,
it
would
raise
grave
constitutional
doubts.
but
this
statute
is
not
such
a
statute.
it
looks
entirely
to
the
material
mail
and
it
focuses
neither
on
the
motives
of
the
mailer
nor
on
the
academic
credentials
of
the
addressee.
there
are
some
other
problems
with
the
government's
suggestion,
one
of
them
shows
what
the
eleventh
hour
suggestion
it
happens
to
be.
this
record
is
absolutely
silent
as
to
the
distribution
that
petitioner
gave
by
handbook.
all
it
shows
is
that
5000
copies
of
the
book
were
mailed.
but
it
really
doesn't
matter
because
the
values
claimed
for
the
handbook
were
not
solely
for
the
clinician
or
the
educator
or
the
professional,
those
people
whom
the
government
would
say
are
permitted
to
read
this
work,
therefore
other
people
will
be
sized.
and
as
far
as
the
handbook
social
advocacy
is
concerned,
it
isn't
even
directed
to
those
classes
of
people.
it's
directed
to
the
public
at
large.
and
so
this
suggestion
by
the
government,
the
suggestion
for
an
additional
restriction
on
redeeming
social
importance
is
without
support
on
this
record
is
inapplicable
to
the
values
claimed
for
the
handbook,
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
statute
and
is
most
probably
unconstitutional
as
well.
the
government
does
agree,
leaving
that
question
aside,
that
if
a
work
has
redeeming
social
importance
it
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
regardless
of
whether
the
other
elements
which
identify
obscenity
maybe
present
in
that
work.
the
government
does
add
that
a
claim
for
redeeming
social
importance
--
that
redeeming
social
importance
will
not
be
established
on
the
basis
of
a
single
well-termed
phrase
or
one
or
two
photographs
of
artistic
merit.
but
we
agree
with
the
government
on
that
but
that's
got
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
and
the
government
doesn't
claim
that
it
does.
what
does
have
much
to
do
with
this
case
is
the
government's
agreement
that
once
you
find
redeeming
social
importance,
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
the
amicus
--
citizens
for
decent
literature
feels
differently
about
this.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
their
brief
for
a
moment.
they
urge
this
court
to
adopt
a
balancing
test
under
which
--
works'
affirmative
values
would
be
measured
against
its
patent
defensiveness
or
prurient
appeal
and
that
from
this
balance
in
someway
we
would
strike
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
works
were
obscene.
this
test
that
the
civil
--
citizens
for
decent
literature
urges
the
court
to
adopt,
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
holding
in
roth
where
it
was
held
that
the
--
obscenity
statutes
cannot
be
used
to
suppress
that
which
has
redeeming
social
importance
and
consider
the
practical
consequences
of
this
for
a
moment.
a
publisher
given
a
manuscript
dealing
with
sexual
matters
would
have
to
examine
that
manuscript,
would
have
to
ascertain
how
much
if
it
constitutes
the
advocacy
of
an
idea,
would
then
have
to
waive
the
relative
merit
of
that
idea
and
having
done
so
would
then
have
to
look
and
see,
"well,
how
much
prurient
interest
is
there
and
how
much
patent
offensiveness
is
there
in
this
work?"
and
he
would
have
to
make
a
self-employed
balancing
test.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
job
that
this
court
is
confronted
with.
i
think
if
the
court
finds
that
the
work
makes
a
serious
claim
to
redeeming
social
importance,
that
work
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that's
--
really
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry
and
so
the
government
agrees
with
this.
but
if
the
publisher
is
required
to
make
these
judgments
to
weigh
the
affirmative
values
against
everything
else
and
match
that
judgment
against
that
of
every
prosecutor
in
the
united
states,
this
would
not
only
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
i
think
it
would
put
all
such
publications
in
a
deep
freeze.
it
would
also
create
an
insurmountable
vagueness
problem.
hairline
precision
is
not
possible
in
this
case.
this
court
has
said
so
time
and
time
again.
everybody
recognizes
that
there
were
difficulties
inherent
in
applying
these
statutes
with
hairline
precision.
these
difficulties
normally
arise
in
the
prurient
interest
and
patent
offensiveness
in
these
areas.
but
we
certainly
don't
need
to
make
the
test
any
less
precise
or
any
more
subjective
and
this
is
precisely
what
the
cdl
was
urging
the
course
--
the
court
to
do.
now,
the
government
agrees
that
this
court
must
exercise
an
independent
judgment
as
to
matters
of
redeeming
social
importance.
no
question
about
that.
this
court
will
make
its
own
judgment
on
that.
but
as
to
prurient
interest
appeal
and
patent
offensiveness,
it
urges
the
court
to
rely
upon
the
findings
of
the
trial
court.
this
court
of
course
does
not
ordinarily
need
questions
of
constitutional
classification
of
the
first
amendment
area
to
the
judgments
of
others.
and
even
if
it
were
inclined
to
rely
on
these
findings,
these
findings
don't
even
support
the
judgments
of
conviction
as
to
eros
and
liaison
where
one
of
the
elements
of
obscenity
is
missing
as
to
each
of
these
publications.
these
findings,
in
addition,
can
have
no
deference
paid
to
them
because
of
the
manner
in
which
they
were
made.
these
are
purportedly
findings
made
pursuant
to
rule
23
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
that
rule
provides
that
in
a
case
tried
without
a
jury,
the
court
shall
make
a
general
finding
and
shall
in
addition
on
request
find
the
facts
especially.
the
trial
court
has
given
no
discretion
to
deny
the
request.
if
it's
made,
these
findings
must
be
issued.
the
request
was
made
in
this
case
the
day
before
the
trial
concluded.
the
following
day,
the
judge
--
trial
judge
pronounced
petitioner
is
guilty
as
to
all
counts
of
the
indictment
and
directed
the
prosecutor
to
prepare
the
findings
in
support
of
that
judgment
of
conviction.
sometime
thereafter,
we
don't
know
when,
the
prosecutor
having
prepared
proposed
findings
submitted
them
to
the
trial
judge
in
the
form
of
an
ex
parte
off
the
record
communication.and
54
days
after
they
adjudged
petitioners
guilty,
the
trial
judge
handed
down
these
so-called
special
findings.
even
if
these
were
an
ordinary
criminal
case
rather
than
a
case
involving
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
requiring
scrupulous
adherence
to
procedures,
the
manner
in
which
the
findings
were
made
here
we
think
would
compel
reversal
of
the
judgment
as
an
independent
consideration.
but
aside
from
that
certainly
no
deference
can
be
made
to
these
findings.
and
this
court
must
also
exercise
an
independent
judgment
on
the
questions
of
prurient
interest
and
patent
offenses.
just
a
word
on
this,
petitioners
believed
and
tried
their
case
on
the
premise
that
these
are
also
concepts
which
lend
themselves
to
objective
evidence
and
they
offered
objective
evidence
as
to
both
of
these
elements
relating
to
the
three
publications
at
issue.
this
was
not
just
opinion
evidence
as
the
government
would
have
you
believe,
there
was
much
of
it
which
was
not
opinion.
but
even
as
to
the
opinion
evidence,
it
was
evidenced
by
qualified
experts,
experts
in
the
mental
processes,
experts
in
what
people
are
reading,
and
so
on.
the
publications
themselves
and
the
evidence
clearly
established
that
there's
no
patent
offensiveness
and
these
works
do
not
have
prurient
interest
appeal
and
we
are
confident
that
this
court
will
reach
that
conclusion
when
these
works
are
examined.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
the
eros
your
honor
sold
for
--
by
subscription
for
19.95
a
year.
the
housewife's
handbook
i
believe
sold
for
$4.95
a
copy,
liaison
was
also
on
subscription.
i
believe
the
annual
subscription
price
was
$15
or
something
close
to
that,
it
was
a
biweekly
publication.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
mr.
chief
justice.
the
position
of
the
government
seems
to
be
that
while
all
of
these
elements
of
obscenity
are
constitutional
requirements,
somehow
one
of
these
elements
commence
itself
to
this
court's
independent
judgment
and
the
other
two
need
not.
well,
this
of
course
doesn't
begin
to
address
itself
to
the
practical
problem
of
what
do
we
do
with
the
burden
posed
upon
the
court
and
reading
all
of
these
works.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
on
the
question
of
redeeming
social
importance
that
is,
whether
or
not
a
work
makes
a
serious
claim
of
redeeming
social
importance,
that
question
can
very
often
be
resolved
on
the
briefs
as
i
think
it
can
be
resolved
on
the
briefs
in
this
case.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
your
honor,
this
court
as
i
understand
its
ruling
has
said
we're
not
going
to
permit
a
book
to
be
suppressed
unless
we
are
satisfied
that
this
is
constitutionally
permissible
if
the
suppression
of
this
book
does
not
run
afoul
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
if
we're
talking
about
freeing
a
work
rather
than
suppressing
it,
certainly
this
court
is
not
obligated
to
run
through
each
and
every
set
--
every
test
as
to
each
of
these
elements
in
making
independent
determination.
this
is
why
i
said
during
my
principal
argument
that
if
there
is
a
determination
that
the
works
have
redeeming
social
importance
that
is
and
can
be
the
end
of
the
inquiry
this
court
need
not
go
beyond
that.
and
in
many,
many
cases
it
need
not
necessarily
read
the
works
in
order
to
make
that
kind
of
a
determination.
this
also
brings
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
it
might.
it
would
depend
upon
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
it
would
depend
upon
the
particular
book
but
i
have
found
this
and
that
is
the
claims
for
redeeming
social
importance
are
not
made
likely,
they
are
serious
claims.
and
there
are
serious
advocacies
in
this
particular
case.
so,
we
need
not
confront
this
question.
there
are
--
the
question
--
the
redeeming
social
importance
as
an
element
is
not
present
in
every
case
that
comes
before
this
court
nor
am
i
sure
will
it
be
present
in
any
cases
that
may
come
before
it
in
the
future.
and
so
this
task
can
be
circumscribed
by
this
threshold
determination
of
redeeming
social
importance.
now,
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
in
certain
instances,
we
think
it
can
be
done
on
the
briefs
here
where
the
government
does
say
if
the
handbook
has
the
values
for
example
dealing
with
the
handbook.
if
the
handbook
has
the
values
claimed
for
it,
then
we
agree
that
it
has
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
would
also
say
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
the
--
these
are
highlighted
in
the
briefs
your
honor
both
in
terms
of
the
content
of
the
publications
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
i
don't
say
that
in
every
situation
this
can
act
as
a
substitute
for
reading
the
book.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
well,
we
think
that
the
descriptions
in
the
briefs
here
of
course
are
adequately
representative
of
the
basis
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
--
of
the
claim
of
social
value.
i
would
--
there's
also
another
matter
here
and
that
goes
to
the
government's
suggestion
that
these
books
be
read
by
pieces.
now,
i
don't
want
my
argument
misconstrued.
i
am
not
saying
that
for
example
if
the
publisher
of
the
ladies'
home
journal
decides
that
they're
going
to
put
in
a
section,
an
article
of
hardcore
pornography
in
next
month's
issue
that
this
law
cannot
reach
that
merely.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
on
this
case
where
the
government
has
stipulated
that
the
works
must
be
viewed
as
a
whole,
must
be
considered
as
a
whole,
they're
precluded
from
even
making
the
argument
here.
and
that
was
their
stipulation.
act
in
1896,
this
court
decided
the
rosen
case
in
which
rosen,
it
wasn't
a
--
rosen
complain
that
he
had
been
convicted
for
a
mail
that
--
because
parts
of
the
works
that
were
under
consideration
were
obscene
and
he
hadn't
been
told
which
parts.
and
the
court's
answered,
that
was
very
simple.
if
you
didn't
understand
what
the
indictment
said,
you
should've
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars.
and
that's
just
what
we
did
here
and
that's
just
what
the
government
gave
us
and
on
that
bill
of
particulars,
there's
simply
no
way
to
read
eros
or
liaison
except
as
a
whole.
and
if
redeeming
social
importance
will
save
the
work
and
the
government
agrees
with
that,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
read
each
and
every
word
of
eros
in
order
to
determine
that
that
book
has
redeeming
social
importance.
i
think
even
amongst
casual
scanning
of
eros
would
achieve
that
purpose.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
if
a
work
makes
a
serious
claim,
not
a
sham
claim
but
a
serious
claim
that
we
will
not
then
be
permitted
--
one
should
not
then
be
allowed
to
debate
the
relative
merit
of
the
claim,
is
it
a
good
idea,
is
it
a
bad
idea.
so
long
as
the
claim
has
made
and
it's
serious
and
it's
supported
by
the
book
or
the
evidence,
i
think
that
creates
redeeming
social
importance.
and
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
no
your
honor,
i'm
reading
it
in
terms
of
a
first
amendment
text.
i'm
saying
that
if
the
work
is
--
i'm
not
saying
whether
it's
socially
good
or
socially
bad
if
it's
advocacy
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
well,
no,
not
at
all.
i'm
sure
that
they've
--
we're
talking
about
consensus.
there
are
many
people
who
would
say
that
ideas
which
maybe
freely
presented
are
nevertheless
bad
ideas,
are
horrible
ideas,
or
unacceptable
ideas,
or
offensive
ideas
but
they're
ideas.
and
in
that
first
amendment,
if
it
teaches
any
thing,
of
course
teaches
that
this
is
a
protection
for
the
minority
utterance
not
the
utterance
that
the
consensus
would
willingly
accept,
otherwise
the
first
amendment
would
have
no
meaning.
and
there
are
really,
that
there's
one
thing
to
be
said
on
this
and
in
terms
of
how
one
deals
with
these
matters,
there
are
four
books
in
this
case,
not
just
three.
there
is
the
three
publications
and
there's
the
transcript
of
the
record
and
that
record
i
think
is
very,
very
illuminating
and
the
testimony
is
illuminating.
and
if
we're
determining
whether
a
serious
claim
is
made
of
redeeming
social
importance,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
must
look
aside
from
the
books
themselves
and
in
addition
to
the
books
themselves
perhaps,
to
those
who
say,
?this
book
has
meaning
to
me,
this
book
is
useful
to
me,?
and
we
cannot
say
you
are
wrong.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
exhibited
and
manifest
within
the
work
itself.
i
don't
think
the
motives
of
the
publisher
if
anything
whatever
to
do
with
this
statute.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
amusement
creates
social
value
if
that
was
what
the
work
in
fact
achieved.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
and
--
but
of
course
i
would
say
that
one
cannot
put
a
man
in
jail
for
his
bad
jokes
and
we
get
to
that
kind
of
a
question
as
well.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
your
honor,
if
there
wasn't
a
profit
motive,
i
just
suppose
books
wouldn't
be
published
in
this
kind
of
thing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
that's
right.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
i
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
would
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
no,
not
by
itself.
it
might
illuminate,
it
might
be
a
guide
just
as
a
critical
review
might
be
a
guide
to
what
the
publishers'
intent
is.
we
might
try
to
read
it
through
that
--
in
those
terms.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
there's
something
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
you
would
have
to
get
it
through
what
is
said
in
the
book,
you
would
also
have
to
get
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
except
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
except
extrinsic
aids,
extrinsic
evidence
such
as
critical
review,
such
as
a
prefatory
statement
of
purpose,
maybe
of
some
aid
in
reading
the
book.
so,
we
say
it
can
be
if
we're
talking
about
that
kind
of
value.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
no
your
honor,
i'm
talking
about
the
seriousness
of
the
claim
as
distinguished
from
a
sham
claim
such
as
the
thing
that
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
your
honor,
this
court
was
able
to
point
up
the
distinction
in
valentine
against
chrestensen.
i
think
when
sham
exists,
it's
apparent,
it's
a
fraud
and
nobody
will
actively
urge
that
it
means
anything
other
than
that.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
it
maybe
of
some
moment,
it's
hardly
conclusive
your
honor.
i
would
say
this
when
you
say
some
agree
and
some
would
disagree.
the
government
of
course
says
that
these
books
are
in
the
doubtful
area.
now,
again
we're
talking
about
a
first
amendment
criminal
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
once
they've
said
that,
they've
said
themselves
out
of
court.
i
hardly
think
they
agree
that
these
tests
are
subject
to
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
and
yet
they
express
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
and
the
only
reason
they
accept
--
the
only
reason
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument
that
they
accept
liaison
is
that
they
say
it's
riotously
vulgar.
well
first,
that
depends
upon
being
able
to
chop
it
up
into
parts.
secondly,
the
stipulation
also
said
that
the
works
are
alleged
to
be
obscene
not
filthy
and
this
court
made
the
distinction
in
limehouse
which
the
government
still
says
is
applicable
and
that
is
vogue,
that
is
obscenity
as
one
thing
and
the
filthy
is
a
separate
class
of
nonmailable
material.
as
far
as
the
claim
of
vulgarity,
well
congress
wrote
that
out
of
this
statute
before
the
turn
of
the
century.
and
i
think
certainly
some
value
has
to
be
attributed
to
that
change
in
the
statutory
language.
i
think
these
epithets
can
be
cast
at
liaison.
there,
it's
a
--
if
--
it
is
vulgar,
there's
no
question
about
it.
it's
sophomoric
that
may
do,
worst
epithet
that
be
--
it
can
be
cast
at
it.
but
to
put
a
man
in
jail
for
mailing
it
is
another
question
especially
when
the
government
agrees
that
it
is
not
hardcore
pornography.
now,
the
government
says
that
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
your
honor,
the
question
really
isn't
what
hardcore
pornography
means
or
how
one
defines
it.
if
i
may
--
just
given
--
i
think
that's
a
red
herring
that's
been
cast
across
this
entire
argument.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
the
question
is
what
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
i
--
may
--
the
question
is
what
hardcore
pornography
is.
and
on
that
nobody
apparently
has
any
disagreement.
the
government
handed
this
court
on
facts,
the
material
during
the
argument
in
roth,
and
it
said
this
is
hardcore
material.
we
handed
up
during
the
trial
of
this
case,
and
they're
at
evidence
in
this
case,
other
examples
of
hardcore
material.
and
the
government
has
no
difficulty
in
describing
this
material
it
says,
in
its
brief,
?all
of
this
material,
we
submit,
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
arousing
lust.
it
cannot
conceivably
be
characterized
as
embodying
communication
of
ideas
or
artistic
values
inviolate
under
the
first
amendment.?
i
would
also
read
to
the
government's
description,
if
that's
the
term
to
be
applied,
that
in
this
day
and
age
it's
difficult
to
conceive
of
any
thing
that's
patently
offensive
unless
it
be
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
yes,
your
honor,
i
did.
they
said
it
was
a
unique
publication
--
mr.
sydney
dickstein
--
which
was
riotously
vulgar.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
mr.
bender
and
i
had
said
--
i
think
that
is
(inaudible).
mr.
sydney
dickstein
excuse
me.
mr.
sydney
dickstein
thank
you.
