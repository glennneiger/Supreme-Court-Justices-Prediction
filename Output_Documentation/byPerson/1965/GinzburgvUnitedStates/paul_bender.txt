mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
dickstein's
argument
has
--
i
believe
made
clear,
this
case
involves
few,
if
any,
issues
of
broad
legal
consequence.
the
principal
issue
indeed,
perhaps
the
only
issue
before
the
court,
is
whether
these
materials,
liaison,
volume
1,
number
1,
eros
volume
1,
number
4
and
the
housewife's
handbook
on
selected
promiscuity
are
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious,
indecent,
filthy
or
vile
within
the
meaning
of
section
1461
of
the
criminal
code.
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
i'll
use
the
word
?obscene?
to
classify
that
long
statutory
phrase.
and
of
course
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
i
think
so.
the
indictment
charge,
all
of
them
but
--
the
court
dealt
with
it
in
terms
of
obscenity
as
i
think
the
word
is
generally
deemed
to
be
interchangeable.
mr.
paul
bender
if
taken
alone,
yes,
i
think
the
phrase
?redeem?
in
a
case
like
this
is
a
--
has
--
carries
one
substantive
concept.
and
of
course
the
--
an
additional
issue
was
whether
if
they
are
within
the
words
of
the
statute,
that's
a
permissively
constitutional
application
of
the
statute.
that
amounts
to
one
issue.
to
the
extent
that
the
court
undertakes
to
exercise
an
independent
judgment
upon
that
question
in
this
case,
an
issue
i
shall
turn
to
shortly,
the
question
whether
the
materials
here
are
obscene
is
one
on
which
no
amount
of
argumentation
in
substitute
for
the
court's
own
examination
of
the
materials.
i
shall
try
later
on
to
give
the
basis
on
which
we
believe
one
may
reasonably
conclude
that
these
materials
are
in
fact
obscene
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
but
i'd
like
to
stress
now
that
we
mainly
rely
as
i
think
we
must
upon
the
unanimous
findings
of
the
courts
below
that
the
materials
are
obscene
and
upon
this
court's
own
examination
of
the
material.
let
me
first
turn
to
the
limited
legal
issues
which
it
seems
to
me
are
present
here.
in
roth
against
united
states,
the
court
held
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press.
petitioners
here
do
not
challenge
that
holding.
there
are
two
amicus
briefs
however
which
do
seem
to
suggest
that
the
court
reexamined
the
roth
case
and
overruled
the
holding
that
there
is
a
category
of
materials,
obscene
materials
which
are
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
in
light
of
the
full
examination
which
the
court
gave
to
that
question
in
roth,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
in
two
cases
since
roth,
opinions
in
the
court
had
adhered
to
the
roth
holding,
the
jacobellis
case
and
manual
enterprises
without
questioning
it,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
petitioners
themselves
don't
challenge
the
holding
of
roth
here,
i
don't
think
we
should
spend
too
much
time
on
it
in
the
argument.
we
spend
some
of
our
brief
in
rebutting
the
constitutional
argument.
it
seems
to
us
in
brief
that
no
basis
is
presented
here
for
reexamining
the
roth
case.
roth's
holding
was
essentially
an
historical
one.
it
always
been
assumed
both
in
the
legislatures
and
in
this
court
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
that
obscene
materials
existed
which
could
be
prohibited
and
that
those
prohibitions
would
not
violate
the
first
amendment
because
first
of
all
of
the
recognized
reasons
for
the
prohibition
of
obscene
materials
and
second
of
all
because
of
the
lack
of
redeeming
social
importance
which
those
materials
carry.
we
find
no
basis
now
to
change
the
factual
assumption
that
obscene
material
exists
which
does
not
have
redeeming
social
importance.
mr.
paul
bender
that
is
one
of
the
tests.
we
agree,
as
mr.
dickstein
said,
that
in
order
to
find
material
obscene,
you
must
find
that
it
has
no
redeeming
social
importance.
you
must
also
find
other
things.
but
we
agree
that
that
is
a
test
of
obscenity.
one
of
the
--
at
least
three
tests
which
we
have
to
meet.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
paul
bender
by
inspection.
mr.
paul
bender
there
were
three
works
in
issue,
as
to
two
of
them
he
was
given
consecutive
jail
sentences.
one
for
two
years
and
one
for
three
years
as
--
mr.
paul
bender
as
to
the
third
liaison,
he
was
given
no
jail
sentence,
so
it's
a
substantial
fine
in
all
accounts
of
--
mr.
paul
bender
$42,000.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it
doesn't
depend
only
on
whether
it
has
no
redeeming
social
value.
you
must
also
find
in
order
to
convict
that
a
material
dominant
appeal
is
to
prurient
interest
and
that
it
is
patently
offensive
in
light
of
contemporary
community
standard.
also,
mr.
justice
black
it
doesn't
depend
entirely
upon
this
court's
ascertainment
of
those
factors
if
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
have
found
that
those
factors
did
not
exist,
the
case
wouldn't
be
here.
this
court
exercises,
we
agree
a
third
stage
of
review
after
both
courts
below
have
found
one
that
the
material
is
patently
offensive,
patently
offensive
in
light
of
community
standards,
two
that
its
basic
dominant
appeal
is
to
prurient
interest,
and
thirdly,
that
in
addition
it
has
no
redeeming
social
importance.
all
those
tests
must
be
met.
mr.
paul
bender
the
most?
mr.
paul
bender
it's
hard
to
say
in
the
abstract.
i
suppose
it
depends
upon
what
the
man
contemplates
doing.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
as
to
any
particular
material,
it
might
be
very
easy
to
decide
--
one,
that
it
didn't
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
and
two,
that
it
wasn't
--
mr.
paul
bender
it
might
be
easy
and
lots
of
--
i
should
i
think
in
cases
in
most
published
work,
that
question
never
arises
whether
it
appeals
to
prurient
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
obscenity
statutes,
nor
i
suppose
that
the
question
arise
in
most
works
whether
it's
patently
offensive.
i
agree
that
there
is
inevitably
a
class
of
borderline
materials
where
there's
going
to
be
some
doubt.
i
don't
think
the
class
is
terribly
large.
i
think
it's
to
the
vast
majority
of
the
material
which
we
prosecute
under
this
section.
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
publisher's
mind
that
it
meets
the
test
of
the
section.
i
suppose
that
material
must
be
somewhere
between
75%
and
95%
of
the
material
which
we
prosecute.
it's
clearly
obscene
material
if
anything
is
obscene
material,
and
i
don't
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
at
least
as
to
the
housewife's
handbook
and
eros,
i
agree.
as
to
the
liaison,
i
think
one
might
think
that
it
did
fall
within
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
at
least
--
to
at
least
two
of
them
is
open
to
argument.
this
obviously,
there
are
some
materials
which
is
borderline.
i
think
at
least
two
of
the
works
here
are
within
the
classification
of
borderline
material.
that's
an
inescapable
problem
whenever
you
have
a
statute
where
you
can't
mathematically
draw
the
line.
you're
going
to
get
material
as
to
which
there's
some
doubt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
bender
largely
photographs,
also
some
books,
comic
book
type
materials.
in
the
roth
case,
we
sent
over
a
box
full
of
this
material.
it's
described
in
the
brief
in
the
roth
and
to
some
extent
in
the
brief
in
this
case.
there
are
also
in
the
record
in
this
case
are
some
materials
put
in
by
petitioners
to
the
record
which
they
conceded
where
within
the
area
of
obscenity.
mr.
justice
black,
they
don't
think
as
to
that
material
there's
any
--
i
don't
think
there
is
--
they
don't
think
as
to
that
material,
a
material
they
put
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
there's
any
doubt
that
it
falls
within
the
statute
and
i
agree.
there
is
clearly
material
and
i
think
it's
--
i
call
the
majority,
the
material
prosecuted
under
the
statute
as
to
which
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
it's
obscene
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
trial
judge
rejected
that
mr.
justice
douglas
as
in
finding
of
fact.
we
would
like
to
have
the
court
accept
the
trial
judge's
rejection.
however,
even
if
that
were
true,
it
seems
to
me
you
could
still
find
such
a
work
to
be
obscene
if
distributed
generally.
i
think
mr.
dickstein
to
some
extent,
inadvertently
i'm
sure,
misstated
the
argument
which
we
make
in
that
regard.
what
we
say
in
particular
with
regard
to
the
housewife's
handbook
is
that
if
the
court
believes
that
to
the
average
man,
it
is
obscene
within
the
meaning
of
the
roth
case,
there
still
might
be
a
defense
open
to
it
if
its
distribution
was
not
to
the
average
man,
if
its
distribution
was
limited
for
clinical
purposes
or
educational
purposes.
we
believe
therefore
that
if
the
court
should
find
that
the
housewife's
handbook
to
the
average
man
is
obscene
then
petitioners
might
have
had
a
defense
if
they
had
shown
that
the
distribution
of
the
housewife's
handbook
was
limited
and
it
wasn't
to
the
average
man.
but
in
that,
this
--
that
in
this
case
there
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
bender
average
person,
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
didn't
read
his
testimony
saying
that
the
clergy
are
divided
on
whether
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
and
he
said
that
he
used
it
in
counseling.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
well,
as
i
say,
the
trial
judge
rejected
that
testimony
as
it
was
purported
to
reflect
upon
what
average
people
would've
done
with
this
book.
mr.
paul
bender
he
didn't
find
so
explicitly.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say,
he
either
found
that
he
was
lying
or
he
found
that
he
wasn't
a
typical
minister
and
didn't
represent
it.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
the
trial
judge
so
found
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals,
yes.
well,
just
a
word
more
about
the
constitutional
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principle
phases
on
which
the
amicus
briefs
urge
that
to
reexamine
roth
is
on
the
assumption
of
the
roth
case
and
the
roth
--
limited
roth
test
of
obscenity
has
led
the
repression
of
sexual
--
sexually
related
materials
since
the
roth
case
was
decided.
that
just
isn't
so
and
i
think
it
--
that
that
assumption
provides
no
basis
for
reexamining.
i
think
the
opposite
is
true,
the
roth
case
is
--
since
the
roth
case
has
been
decided,
i
think
it
--
the
court
can
take
note
of
the
fact
that
there's
been
a
greater
dissemination
of
such
materials.
mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
move
now
to
the
one
or
two
legal
issues
which
i
think
do
separate
petitioners
from
the
government.
principally,
the
point
of
difference
on
the
application
of
the
roth
standard
seems
to
be
in
the
way
in
which
you
apply
the
test
to
works
like
eros
and
liaison
which
are
anthologies
rather
than
integrated
works.
the
handbook
is
a
single
integrated
work
and
i
don't
think
we
have
any
dispute
over
how
you
apply
the
standards
there.
but
our
view
is
that
when
you
get
a
collection
of
independent
works
like
eros
and
likely
this
issue
of
liaison,
the
work
is
obscene
if
any
of
the
substantial
parts
of
it
are
obscene.
we
don't
believe
that
you
privilege
a
work
by
putting
some
non-obscene
material
in
with
other
obscene
material
if
the
material
is
not
a
whole,
if
it's
just
a
bunch
of
independent
pieces
strung
together
in
an
anthology.
you
can't,
for
example
in
our
view,
sandwich
concededly
pornographic
obscene
photographs
with
other
innocuous
photographs
and
binding
them
together
in
a
book
and
thereby
privilege
the
entire
thing.
we
believe
that
this
approach
is
wholly
consistent
with
our
stipulation
in
the
trial
court
that
you
were
to
view
these
works
as
a
whole.
we
did
not
mean
by
that
stipulation.
i
don't
think
it's
reasonable
to
attribute
to
that
stipulation,
the
meaning
that
every
part
of
these
works
had
to
be
obscene,
that
is
clearly
an
impossible
standard
for
us
to
meet
and
we
never
attempted
to
set
that
burden
for
ourselves.
it
means
that
you
can't
take
works
out
of
context
but
when
you
got
the
series
of
independent
works,
we
see
no
reason
why
you
can't,
as
the
trial
judge,
explicitly
did
with
regard
to
eros
taken
in
that
case,
four
of
them,
which
clearly
constitutes
a
substantial
part
of
the
work.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
what
the
phrase
means.
in
many
places
where
it's
been
used,
some
state
cases
we
refer
to
in
the
brief
for
example,
it's
been
used
as
the
entire
equivalent
of
the
roth
test.
if
that's
what
it
means,
then
yes
we
do
claim
that
this
material
is
that.
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
narrower
concept
for
example
petitioners
suggest
in
a
footnote
in
their
brief
by
reference
to
a
recent
work
on
the
subject
that
its
peculiar,
its
work
which
embodies
a
peculiar
psychological
effect,
a
series
of
episodes
which
increase
in
tension
and
increase
in
their
sexual
effect.
if
that's
what
it
means,
this
work
is
not
hardcore
pornography.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
concept
of
obscenity
is
limited
to
that
particular
kind
of
work
with
that
particular
kind
of
psychological
effect.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
it
--
if
the
material
is
typically
either
photographs
or
printed
works
of
perhaps
at
least
half
of
it
is
photographs.
they're
usually
photographs
explicitly
depicting
all
manners
--
sexual
conduct
including
acts
of
perversion
and
sodomy.
sometimes
they're
in
series,
sometimes
they're
--
some
times
they're
just
separate.
other
books,
the
usually
small
pamphlets
which
are
nothing
more
than
a
verbal
description
of
what
the
photographs
depict,
some
pretense
of
the
story
but
very
little,
sometimes
they're
illustrated
with
photographs.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
not
in
to
the
category
of
things
i
have
so
far
described.
one
of
these
falls
into
a
category
of
what
you
might
call
vulgar
sexual
--
we
think
vulgar
sexual
works.
a
minor
part
i
would
think
of
that
large
class
of
concededly
obscene
material
and
that
we
think
is
liaison.
there
aren't
too
many
other
publications
like
liaison
that
we're
aware
of.
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
--
if
i
gave
you
that
impression,
i
want
to
withdraw
the
statement.
and
i
don't
think
liaison
is
like
any
of
--
to
this
mass
of
material,
like
it
in
character.
liaison
is
quite
of
--
is
quite
unique
in
our
experience
of
publication.
it's
a
collection
of
dirty
jokes
and
smutty
stories
for
which
seems
to
us
riotously
vulgar
in
a
sexual
way.
but
the
mass
of
material
which
we
are
aware
of
doesn't
bear
much
relationship
to
that.
and
the
estimate
also
as
to
the
percentage
is
the
vaguest
kind
of
estimate.
we
have
no
sure
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
bender
we
have
no
sure
way
of
knowing.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
application
of
the
test
to
these
three
particular
materials.
and
first
of
all
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
scope
of
review
in
this
court.
we
recognized
that
in
the
past
since
the
roth
case
and
in
the
roth
case
itself,
individual
opinions
in
this
court
have
suggested
that
the
court
will
formulate
in
these
cases
an
independent
constitutional
judgment
regarding
the
obscenity
of
particular
materials
involved
at
least
in
federal
prosecutions.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
in
light
of
the
constitutional
nature
of
the
judgment
involved
as
to
whether
a
work
is
obscene
or
not
and
the
intimate
relationship
with
the
first
amendment,
we
would
not
think
it
inappropriate
if
the
court
wishes
to
exercise
that
complete
de
novo
independent
review
of
the
materials
in
this
case.
we
would
however
like
to
suggest
an
alternative
to
complete
independent
review
of
all
the
questions
regarding
whether
a
work
is
obscene.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
to
any
work
which
the
court
believes
has
reasonably
been
characterized
by
the
trier
of
fact
as
obscene,
meeting
the
three
standards
separately
stated.
the
court
might
properly
limit
its
independent
examination
to
the
question
whether
the
work
carries
redeeming
social
importance
that
is
if
their
judgment
that
the
work
appeals
to
prurient
interest
is
reasonable
that
the
judgment
that
it's
patently
offensive
seems
reasonable.
and
to
that
of
course,
you
have
to
look
at
the
material.
but
if
you
look
at
the
materials
and
decided
the
judgments
below
seemed
reasonably
based,
then
we
suggest
that
the
court
might
limit
its
independent
--
completely
independent
judgment
to
the
question
of
whether
there's
redeeming
importance.
there
are
two
reasons
for
this,
two
reasons
we
think
support
this
approach.
first
of
all,
in
terms
of
vindicated,
the
affirmative
protections
of
the
first
amendment,
the
principle
reason
for
this
court's
review,
it's
the
redeeming
social
importance
which
is
important.
if
the
work
has
redeeming
social
importance,
the
first
amendment
affirmatively
means
to
permit
its
dissemination
and
that
we
think,
it's
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
safeguard
by
its
independent
review.
but
if
the
court
finds
no
redeeming
social
importance,
then
those
affirmative
values
of
the
first
amendment
don't
seem
to
be
involved.
and
if
it's
clear
that
the
material
is
within
the
area
of
obscenity,
it's
reasonably
been
determined
to
be
obscene,
the
fact
that
particular
justices
on
the
court
may
disagree
with
the
precise
where
--
place
in
which
you
draw
the
line
seems
to
us
not
really
to
come
into
collision
with
the
affirmative
values
of
the
first
amendment.
and
secondly
--
mr.
paul
bender
with
regard
to
the
social
value,
if
you're
going
to
review
it
all,
i
see
very
little
way
in
which
you
can
except
by
reading
the
works.
that's
--
i
just
don't
see
anyway
on
which
you
can
do
it.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
and
they
did.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
you
could
if
the
court
willing
to
set
up
the
standard
of
reviewing
the
judgments
below
simply
to
see
whether
they
were
reasonably
based
whether
they
were
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
you
could
--
you
could
apply
such
a
scope
of
review
without
reading
the
materials
or
without
reading
them
in
detail.
the
court
in
the
past
has
not
suggested
that
that
is
the
scope
of
review
in
these
cases.
it
has
suggested
that
the
court
will
exercise
a
more
independent
function.
we
don't
challenge
that
here.
we,
to
some
extent
however,
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
it's
an
open
question.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
don't
think
so,
for
example
--
mr.
paul
bender
in
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
we
submit,
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
to
rely
to
some
extent
upon
the
findings
below
that
these
materials
are
obscene.
if
you're
going
to
review
the
case
at
all,
it
seems
to
me
inescapable
that
you've
got
to
look
at
the
materials
otherwise
--
or
you'd
have
to
do
it
on
the
testimony
before
the
lower
courts.
but
in
lots
of
these
cases
there
isn't
much
testimony,
the
works
are
judged
below
on
the
basis
of
the
works
themselves.
and
if
you're
going
to
review
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
look
into
the
works
themselves.
i'm
just
trying
to
suggest
now
that
you
might
look
at
the
work
and
if
you
satisfy
yourself
that
the
judgment
of
obscenity
below
is
reasonable,
and
that
it
seems
to
me
you
can
probably
do
without
too
exhaustive
--
an
examination
of
the
work,
then
you
might
rest
in
affirmance
there.
you
might
also
alternatively
distinguish
between
federal
prosecutions
and
state
cases.
mr.
justice
harlan
had
suggested
that
in
the
past.
that
would
be
--
mr.
paul
bender
what?
mr.
paul
bender
no,
we
have
--
we
don't
have
a
state
case
here
and
we
take
no
position
on
whether
the
scope
of
review
in
state
cases
should
be
different
from
your
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
scope
of
review
in
federal
cases.
i'm
suggesting
that
there
are
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
suggest
to
you
that
so
far
as
federal
prosecutions
are
concerned,
and
that's
all
i
know
anything
about
directly,
the
burden
will
not
the
onerous
because
the
number
of
cases
which
you
will
get
where
there
have
been
convictions
under
the
federal
statute,
where
there
is
any
real
doubt
about
the
obscenity
will
be
very,
very
small.
this
i
agree
is
one
of
them
and
there
are
presently
pending
two
or
three
others.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
there
are
a
large
number
of
obscenity
prosecutions
but
they
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
think
another
reason
is
that
a
large
majority
of
guilty
pleas.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
my
figures
are
not
sure
in
my
mind.
i'm
sure
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
pleas
of
both
sorts.
we
generally
restrict
our
prosecutions
to
materials
which
we
feel
are
clearly
within
the
area
of
obscenity.
so,
in
most
of
the
cases
which
this
court
would
get
here
on
petition,
as
i
say,
will
be
cases
in
which
they
will
be,
i
think
very
little
doubt
of
the
obscenity
of
the
material.
so
i
don't
think
federal
prosecutions
will
put
an
excessive
burden
upon
this
court.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
and
of
course
there's
no
way
we
can
control
those
prosecution.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
you
would
know
--
the
court
would
know
better
than
i
would
whether
in
the
year
since
roth
there
has
been
an
overwhelming
burden
of
those
cases
coming
from
the
states.
my
impression
was
that
there
hadn't
been.
that
the
court
hadn't
been
diluted
with
an
unworkable
workload
of
obscenity
cases.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
it
was
--
could
--
number
of
years
ago.
mr.
paul
bender
could
be
more
than
that.
mr.
paul
bender
i
suggest
perhaps
if
the
workload
ever
gets
overburdening,
that
may
be
an
occasion
to
reconsider
the
formulation
in
roth
and
attempt
to
formulate
a
test
which
would
not
call
upon
this
court's
independent
review
to
that
extent.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
we
feel
in
this
case
that
the
deference
to
lower
court
findings
if
the
court
wishes
to
review
the
cases
like
this
in
that
manner
is
especially
appropriate
with
regard
to
liaison.
with
regard
to
the
housewife's
handbook
and
eros,
we
recognized
that
at
the
trial
there
was
substantial
testimony
that
the
works
did
not
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
was
not
patently
offensive
in
light
of
contemporary
community
standards
and
that
they
had
redeeming
value.
and
the
court
may
feel
that
in
that
circumstance
where
the
judge
rejects
an
overwhelming
volume
of
testimony
to
that
effect,
his
findings
are
not
entitled
to
this
much
presumptive
validity
as
in
the
case
of
liaison
where
there's
almost
no
testimony
dealing
with
the
value
of
the
work
or
suggesting
that
the
work
is
not
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
not.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
that
as
i
remember
it
was
material
directed
to
--
concededly
directed
to
a
special
group
of
people
where
one
might
expect
that
the
trier
of
fact
would
not
be
able
fully
to
appreciate
the
impact
of
the
material.
and
insofar
as
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
reader
is
involved,
i
think
the
court
held
there
that
you
needed
some
testimony
to
demonstrate
that
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
we
did
not
because
it
was
so
narrowly
based.
it
simply
said
that
we
had
to
introduce
evidence
and
we
didn't
feel
it,
we
were
justified
in
bothering
the
court
with
something
which
we
could
solve
in
that
manner.
mr.
paul
bender
i
was
not
in
agreement
with
justice
fortas.
