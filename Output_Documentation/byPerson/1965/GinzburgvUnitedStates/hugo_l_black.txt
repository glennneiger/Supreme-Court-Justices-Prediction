justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
test
on
which
you
depend?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
to
be
found
--
to
be
determined
by
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
inspection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
was
this
man
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
five
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
fine,
40?
justice
hugo
l.
black
five
years
given
on
the
basis
as
far
as
he
is
concern
ends
entirely
from
whether
this
court
on
inspection
of
a
book
determined
that
it
has
no
redeeming
social
value,
that's
the
case
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
of
those
do
you
consider
the
most
definite?
justice
hugo
l.
black
most
definite
so
that
a
man
could
have
an
idea
whether
he
go
to
jail
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
reading
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
--
which
one
in
your
judgment
could
a
man
come
here
and
guessing
how
this
court
would
ultimately
decide
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
easy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
it
if
you
suppose
to
look
at
the
whole
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
reading
the
book?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
your
standing
for
that?
deciding
it
has
redeeming
social
importance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
is
that
if
the
--
some
circumstances
on
which
we
can
just
decide
that
the
thing
is
socially
good,
ordinarily
of
course,
it's
for
legislative
branches
to
determine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it
has
to
be
good,
it
has
redeeming
social
values,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
said
that
--
you've
said
that
twice,
there's
no
reference
to
hardcore
pornography,
that
this
could
be
defined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i
was
surprised
to
hear
you
continue
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
