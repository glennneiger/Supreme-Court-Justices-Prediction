your
view
that
all
of
those
elements
have
to
coincide
to
constitute
obscenity
or
that
if
any
one
of
the
elements
exist?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
only
one
--
that's
the
only
one
that
the
court
has
ever
tried
to
define
or
deal
with,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
some
of
the
other
adjectives
from
the
statute
which
you
just
quoted
have
quite
a
--
quite
a
different
meaning,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bender,
this
material
here
is
not
included
in
that
75%
to
90%,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
this
seems
to
me,
you
kind
of
contradicting
yourself.
you
said
as
to
75%
or
90%,
there
can
be
no
argument
about
it,
that
if
anything
is
obscene,
it
is
obscene.
and
now
you're
saying
that
at
least
one
of
these
things,
they're
--
it's
open
to
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
the
trial
judge
found
that
the
minister
was
lying
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
implicitly,
did
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
before
lunch
you
were
referring
to
the
fact
--
you
said
that
some
are
between
75%
and
90%
of
the
material
were
prosecuted
by
the
federal
government
is
so
clearly
obscene
that
there
could
be
no
argument
about
it
and
i
gather
that
you
imply
that
we
--
this
court
wouldn't
even
be
listening
to
arguments
about
whether
or
not
it
was
obscene.
how
would
you
describe
that
kind
of
material
or
is
there
a
description
for
it,
just
a
shorthand
description?
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
miss
--
did
i
misunderstand
you
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
one
of
these
three
publications
falls
into
that
category?
justice
potter
stewart
you
meant
the
vast
majority,
and
i
accepted
that,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
weren't
you
really
right
the
first
time
in
answer
to
brother
fortas'
question,
the
motive.
i
presume
we
live
in
a
capitalistic
society
and
i
suppose
the
motive
of
most
publishers
and
publishing
and
selling
books
of
any
kind
is
to
make
money.
justice
potter
stewart
many,
and
except
by
philanthropists.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
why
is
--
why
wasn't
your
answer
correct
the
first
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
except
insofar
as
it's
reflected
in
the
nature
of
the
publication
and
not
even
the
publisher
is
irrelevant?
