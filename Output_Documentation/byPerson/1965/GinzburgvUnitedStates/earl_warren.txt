chief
justice
earl

we'll
recess
now.
(inaudible)
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
should
we
conclude
that
we
have
to
read
every
one
of
these
books
and
review
it
for
its
social
value
or
what
standard
of
reliance
do
you
suggest
for
us
to
use
so
far
as
the
lower
courts
are
concerned
in
determining
that
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
the
courts
suppose
--
below,
suppose
to
find
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
and
if
they
do,
are
we
obliged
to
--
are
we
obliged
to
read
all
these
books?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now,
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
these
three
cases
that
we
have
here
today,
i
imagine
there
are
25
books,
do
we
have
to
read
every
one
of
those
books
and
determine
whether
they
--
there
are
independent
judgments
as
to
whether
each
of
them
has
social
value?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
we
going
to
draw
this
--
draw
the
line
in
this?
i'm
so
sure
that
this
court
doesn't
want
to
be
the
final
censor
in
reading
all
of
the
prurient
literature
of
the
country
to
determine
whether
it
has
any
social
value
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
suggest
that
that
is
the
test?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
justice
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
--
i
think
you
ought
to
recognize
that
it's
not
only
the
case
as
we
take
here
for
argument
but
we
can
expect,
no
matter
what
test
we
lay
down,
we
can
expect
numerous
petitions
for
certiorari
here
and
i
suppose
that
it's
a
function
of
this
court
to
determine
the
social
value
of
it,
we
would
have
to
read
everyone
of
those
books
before
we
determine
whether
we
would
grant
certiorari.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
only
because
the
government
hasn't
filed
many
suits
of
that
kind.
now,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
i've
--
i
made
a
survey
few
years
ago
when
we
had
one
of
these
cases
and
i
found
that
the
government
had
only
gone
to
trial
in
about
six
cases
in
the
entire
united
states
each
year
over
a
period
of
several
years
and
that
would
indicate
that
the
only
reason
that
we
don't
get
them
here
is
because
the
government
doesn't
fully
prosecute
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
did
notice
that
in
all
--
frankly,
all
of
those
cases
where
they
had
jury
trials,
that
there
were
convictions,
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
the
government
filed,
they
permitted
the
defendants
to
plead
nolo
contendere,
not
plead
guilty
but
to
plead
nolo
contendere
and
then
practically
all
of
those,
there
was
a
fine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
have
50
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
don't
suppose
we
can,
but
i'm
wondering
about
our
situation
on
the
court
if
you
think
that
that
the
final
burden
of
reading
these
books
and
determining
the
social
value
of
them
or
lack
of
it
depends
upon
this
court,
it
looks
though
to
me
we're
in
trouble.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
roth
is
a
pretty
recent
test.
chief
justice
earl
warren
four
-
five?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dickstein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
think
it'd
be
just
the
opposite,
mr.
dickstein.
i
would
think
it
would
be
very
obvious
if
there
was
obscenity
in
the
book
but
i
would
think
that
it
would
probably
take
a
reading
of
the
entire
book
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
social
value
in
the
entire
work.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
--
oh,
wouldn't
that
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
what
he
said
in
the
book,
what
--
how
could
we
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
that
does
in
involve
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
his
motives
in
publishing
it,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
seemed
to
me
you
put
great
emphasis
on
the
serious
contention
in
this
book
that
it
did
have
social
value.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
you
are
testing
that
book
by
--
apparently,
by
the
sincerity
and
the
logic
of
the
man
who
writes
that
portion
of
it,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
will
you
tell
me
how
the
--
how
can
you
distinguish
those
for
a
man
in
serious
terms
writes
both
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
might
find
that
on
this
court
there
will
be
those
who
will
think
that
some
of
these
books
at
least
are
vile
and
indecent
and
obscene,
they
were
--
they
might
agree.
others
might
not
feel
it
--
might
not
that.
and
would
you
say
that
the
--
that
what
the
man
who
writes
a
book
has
to
say
about
the
social
importance
of
it
and
what
he
intends
the
book
to
portray
to
the
public
is
of
any
importance
to
us
in
deciding
what
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
