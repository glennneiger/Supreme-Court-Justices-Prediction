justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
a
different
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
point
too
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
was
he
found
to
be
dangerous?
you
say
there's
considerable
evidence,
in
what
way,
violent
or
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
caused
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
the
nature
of
his
violence
is
not
in
our
records?
justice
hugo
l.
black
evidently,
what
this
record
shows
is
what
the
doctors
thought
about
him
and
the
diagnoses
they
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
after
reading
the
record,
but
we
do
not
have
available
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
record
showing,
actual
occurrences
on
which
the
doctor
based
that
conclusion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
we
justified
in
concluding
from
this
record
that
under
the
law
which
is
under
psychiatric,
what
state
of
new
york
does
is
to
create
one
classification
for
a
man
or
woman
who
has
been
in
jail
and
convicted
and
another
classification
for
those
who
have
not
been
in
jail
and
convicted
so
that
the
one
who
has
been
in
jail
is
out
is
denied
the
right
to
a
lawyer
and
denied
the
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
while
the
others
are?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
he's
been
in
jail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
he's
been
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
former
convict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
classify
on
that
word?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
it's
not
correct
that
new
york
has
a
classification,
which
treats
them
wholly
differently,
to
treat
those
wholly
differently
who
have
ex-convicts
from
those
who
were
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
he
was
an
ex-convict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
law
has
been
repealed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
the
kind
of
hearing
they
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
is
transferred
while
he's
in
prison,
term
has
not
expired,
they
get
him
in
there,
his
term
expires
so
that
they
can
no
longer
hold
him
in
prison
on
the
basis
of
the
sentence,
is
he
then
subject
to
be
held
without
a
kind
of
procedural
protections
that
would
have
to
be
in
new
york,
it
would
have
to
be
accorded
under
new
york
law
people
who
were
just
put
in
there
--
sentenced
to
go
in
there
are
judged
insane
and
to
go
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
gather,
maybe
that's
the
claim
they're
making
exactly,
i'm
not
sure.
as
i
gather,
what
happens
to
him
is
that
since
he
--
undoubtedly
he
will
--
will
say
he's
already
--
he
was
put
in
there
correctly
while
he
was
under
sentence,
state
could
do
it
--
choosing,
thinking
that
would
be
a
better
place
to
keep
him
in
prison.
but
when
his
term
expires
and
they
no
longer
have
a
right
to
keep
him,
the
only
way
he
can
get
out,
as
i
understand
it,
is
of
course
for
doctors
who
examined
him
and
say
that
he
can
now
get
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
way
isn't
it?
the
only
way,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he's
not
entitled
to
get
a
jury
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he
were
out
and
they
want
to
put
him
in
there,
he
would
be
entitle
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
get
this
trial
before
the
court,
is
that
right?
