mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
essentially,
this
case
involves
the
question
of
the
rights
to
be
awarded
to
the
mentally
ill
and
the
procedures
whereby
their
mental
illness
is
determined
and
they
are
placed
in
custody.
mr.
baxstrom
was
convicted
of
a
crime
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
he
received
a
sentence
of
two-and-a-half
to
three
years.
after
completing
service
of
that
sentence,
he
was
committed
to
the
state
hospital
where
he
presently
is
in
custody
having
served
far
in
excess
of
the
original
criminal
sentence
which
was
imposed
on
him.
at
the
time
of
his
commitment,
he
appeared
before
the
surrogate's
court
in
clinton
county.
he
received
notice
that
a
commitment
proceeding
was
being
instituted
against
him.
he
was
afforded
a
hearing
of
sorts.
he
was
not
offered
counsel.
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
and
he
took
no
real
part
in
the
proceedings
other
than
to
indicate
that
he
did
not
believe
he
belonged
in
the
institution
to
which
he
was
going
to
dissent.
thereafter,
he
sued
out
several
writs
of
habeas
corpus,
the
last
of
which
has
reached
this
court.
we
claim
that
the
commitment
of
the
petitioner
after
the
exploration
of
this
criminal
sentence
was
the
kind
of
proceeding
to
which
the
right
to
counsel
attaches.
we
claim
this
as
a
right
to
counsel
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
claim
this
right
to
counsel
as
a
specific
incident
to
the
due
process
right
to
notice
and
hearing.
we
maintain
that
there
is
no
hearing
and
can
be
no
hearing
in
a
case
of
this
type
if
the
man
is
not
represented
by
counsel.
looking
specifically
at
the
record
which
shows
the
kind
of
commitment
proceeding
we
have
in
this
case,
mr.
baxstrom
was
given
notice
that
he
was
going
to
appear
in
the
surrogate's
court
on
december
6,
1961.
he
appeared
there
without
counsel.
the
trial
judge
had
already
read
the
certificates
of
two
physicians
who
were
independent
of
the
hospital
and
when
the
state
law
had
examined
him.
neither
those
physicians
testified
at
this
hearing,
yet
their
certificates
were
instrumental
in
having
mr.
baxstrom
committed
and
their
certificates
with
the
basis
upon
which
the
finding
of
mental
illness
was
made.
in
their
certificates,
two
physicians
stated
that
mr.
baxstrom
possibly
had
a
tendency
to
be
dangerous.
i
am
not
certain
what
this
means
but
i
certainly
would
hope
that
had
there
been
an
attorney
there
to
represent
mr.
baxstrom
at
this
commitment,
he
might
have
developed
that
possibly
has
a
tendency
to
be
dangerous
is
not
a
committable
state
of
being
in
the
state
of
new
york.
in
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
hearing,
a
position
testified
that
he
had
examined
petitioner
and
found
basically
that
the
petitioner
was
an
epileptic
and
diagnosed,
there
was
no
objective
sign
of
this
but
he
diagnosed
that
there
might
be
brain
damage
or
brain
deterioration
flowing
from
the
epilepsy
and
then
he
described
baxstrom's
condition
that
the
patient
was
irritable,
confused,
and
aggressive
after
his
epileptic
seizures
like
all
other
epileptics.
now,
i
am
not
trying
to
re-litigate
or
litigate
because
this
has
never
been
litigated,
the
question
of
whether
this
man
is
or
is
not
insane
or,
was
or
was
not
insane.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
testimony
of
doctor
kerr,
which
i
quote
--
it
was
in
the
proceeding
on
the
first
writ,
which
is
record
page
27,
i
believe
sir.
i'm
sorry,
the
doctor
said,
“it
is
not
an
uncommon
happening
in
cases
of
epilepsy”.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right,
the
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
first,
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
new
procedure
applies
to
the
“criminally
insane”
because
this
is
a
hospital,
maintained
by
the
department
of
correction
as
distinguished
from
the
department
of
mental
hygiene.
so,
there
is
that
first
question
of
whether
or
not
this
new
procedure
or
service
is
available
to
him.
i've
tried
to
find
out
but
it
is
all
--
it's
in
the
process
of
being
setup.
if
it
will
apply
to
patients
at
dannemora,
they
will
probably
get
to
him
in
several
years.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i'm
just
judging
by
the
usual
speed
with
which
administrative
agencies
in
the
state
of
new
york
operate.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh!
definitely
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
he
can
require
but
the
point
is
that
this
new
service
really
provides
nothing
more.
the
new
service
merely
creates
an
agency
to
do
what
the
court
in
the
past
how
to
do
in
the
courtroom.
this
new
agency,
the
mental
health
information
service,
they
are
not
advocates.
they
received
the
files
periodically.
they
reviewed
the
files,
they
make
the
same
kinds
of
decisions
that
perhaps
a
physician
in
the
hospital,
an
administrator
in
the
hospital
would
make.
this
man
should
stay
in.
this
man
should
get
out.
and
then
if
the
patient
is
dissatisfied,
he
will
--
he
can
sue
out
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
that's
past.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that's
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
there
is
a
statement
in
the
state's
brief
that
the
service
can
represent
the
patient
that
is
just
not
so
--
that
is
not
their
function.
now,
as
i
understand
the
state's
arguments
in
answer
to
our
contentions,
they
say
on
the
one
hand
this
is
a
civil
proceeding
and
the
right
to
counsel
doesn't
apply
to
civil
proceedings.
and
then
they
say
in
response
to
our
other
arguments
dealing
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
several
statutes
involved
that
those
statutes
are
not
unconstitutional
because
here
we're
dealing
with
the
criminally
insane.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
state
is
taking
rather
ambivalent
position.
we
lose
on
the
right
to
counsel
because
this
is
a
civil
case.
we
lose
on
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
to
the
patient's
right
to
have
a
broader
determination
of
whether
he
should
be
in
an
institution
such
as
dannemora
because
that
is
a
criminal
kind
of
proceeding.
it
seems
that
the
state
is
asking
too
much.
now
quite
frankly,
essentially,
we
are
dealing
with
statutes
which
have
been
amended
and
re-amended
and
re-amended
from
time
in
memorial.
the
people
who
are
involved
in
these
cases
are
people
who,
quite
frankly,
no
one
has
ever
really
cared
about
one
way
or
the
other.
the
statutes
have
grown
up
as
hotchpotch
statutes
to
meet
specific
situations.
each
time
a
court
decides
a
case,
a
statute
gets
amended
but
never
in
relation
to
the
overall
picture.
in
this
case,
while
i
could
limit
this
case
to
very
specific
instances
of
prejudice
which
are
demonstrated
at
this
point,
we
feel
that
we
are
entitled
to
ask
that
people
subject
to
this
kind
of
awful
imprisonment,
well
that
is
what
it
is,
should
have
some
minimum
safeguards
attached
to
their
custody.
i
cannot
see
how
mr.
baxstrom
could
be
entitled
to
the
full
scope
of
the
constitution
when
he
was
charged
with
assault
in
the
second
degree
and
was
sentenced
to
two-and-a-half
to
three
years
imprisonment
and
now
that
he
--
and
not
have
at
least
something
close
to
those
rights
when
the
state
seeks
to
put
him
away
from
what
essentially
is
going
to
be
the
rest
of
his
life.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
your
honor.
the
--
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
baxstrom's
epilepsy,
this
was
speculation,
was
caused
by
either
an
infection
that
he
got
or
a
case
of
malaria
that
he
contracted
while
serving
in
the
pacific.
so
his
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
so,
it
would
be
not
to
be
before
1946.
there's
no
indication
as
to
what
his
prior
--
what
caused
the
prior
offenses.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
basic
--
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
if
i
may
explain
sir.
i
do
have
a
slight
embarrassment
in
the
way
that
this
record
was
created.
this
was
a
pro
se
proceeding
throughout
all
of
the
state
courts
and
in
all
of
the
separate
habeas
proceedings.
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
that
mr.
baxstrom
was
indigent.
i
cannot
claim
--
i
therefore
felt
that
i
could
not
say
that
basis
for
our
relief
should
be
his
indigence
and
his
lack
of
knowledge
of
counsel.
i've
couched
it
in
terms
that
the
state
must
afford
each
person
in
these
situations,
the
opportunity
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
which
means
if
they
can
afford
it
then
they
can
go
out
and
hire
a
lawyer,
which
means
if
they
can't
afford
it
that
the
state
must
assign
him
counsel.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
couched
it
specifically
to
meet
that
situation
in
the
record
sir.
now,
the
intertwining
of
the
statutes,
i
think,
is
very
significant
to
show
how
these
criminally
insane
are
shunted
out
of
rights
which
other
people
similarly
situated
except
for
their
conviction
received.
every
person
in
the
state
of
new
york,
if
they
are
picked
up
on
the
street
and
brought
to
a
receiving
hospital,
and
then
a
complaint
or
a
proceeding
is
instituted
against
them
to
have
them
committed,
may
as
a
matter
of
right
at
some
point
demand
a
jury
trial.
they
have
this
first,
an
initial
determination
by
a
court
that
this
person
should
be
committed,
then
there
is
a
de
novo
review
of
this
commitment
at
which
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.every
civilly
committed
patient
in
new
york
receives
that
jury
trial
if
he
knows
enough
to
request
it
and
if
he
does
request
it.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
new
york
has
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
in
all
proceedings
which
means
the
absolute
right
to
retain
counsel.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
in
terms
of
interpreting
new
york
statute
sir?
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
new
york
has
interpreted
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
there
is
only
one
exposition
on
this
by
a
higher
new
york
court
in
people
against
kamisaroff,
in
13
new
york
2d
where
the
court
does
interpret
the
statute,
that
is
the
--
section
384
of
the
correction
law.
also
in
that
case,
they
do
discussed
the
right
to
counsel
question
and
it
actually
didn't
appear
to
have
been
raised
in
that
case
but
it
was
discussed
and
it
was
closed
over
by
the
majority
opinion
as
not
--
as
not
applying
in
that
specific
case.
now,
i
would
--
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour,
i
would
like
to
shorten
my
argument
perhaps,
save
a
few
moments.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
clarify
this
question
of
the
procedure
in
new
york.
the
first
stage
is
the
man
is
in
prison
serving
a
penal
sentence.
in
1961
--
and
we
do
have
a
problem
of
time
because
the
statutes
did
change.
in
1961,
when
the
warden
of
the
prison
decided
that
a
man
in
his
custody
was
insane,
he
would
sign
a
certificate
requiring
his
transfer
to
dannemora
state
hospital.
there
was
no
provision
for
hearing.
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that's
383
that
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
in
1961.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
is
not
the
present
383,
and
that
is
not
the
383
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
at
that
time.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
there
was
no
court
order
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
excuse
me.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
which
was
the
--
at
that
time,
was
the
certificate
of
the
warden.
now,
approximately
four
months
after
this
transfer,
there
was
a
decision
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
people
ex
rel.
brown
against
johnston
which
dealt
with
this
problem
and
as
a
result
of
that
decision,
section
383
was
changed.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
then
he
is
in
the
status
of
a
prisoner
patient
at
dannemora
being
held
under
383.
just
before
this
prison
sentence
is
about
to
expire,
the
director
of
the
hospital
brings
a
commitment
proceeding.
this
is
the
first
real
commitment
proceeding
before
a
court
against
the
patient.
that
is
the
proceeding
that
we
had
here
pursuant
to
384.
at
the
time
it
was
instituted,
baxstrom
was
still
a
prisoner
with
only
several
weeks
to
go.
the
court
entered
an
order
dealing
with
his
future
confinement
after
the
expiration
of
his
sentence.
now,
going
back
to
question,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
and
to
carry
it
a
little
further
about
the
man
who
was
picked-up
on
the
street,
that
man
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
is
insane.
if
he
is
found
to
be
insane,
he
is
committed
to
a
civil
mental
hospital,
if
while
he
is
at
that
hospital,
they
decide
that
this
man
in
addition
to
his
insanity
is
particularly
dangerous,
most
insane
people
are
dangerous
or
possibly
most
than
more.
but
he
is
particularly
dangerous,
they
then
must
institute
a
new
commitment
--
a
new
proceeding
under
section
85
of
the
mental
hygiene
law,
and
at
that
new
proceeding,
there
are
specific
things
which
must
be
proven,
and
if
they
are
proven
then
he
may
be
transferred
to
a
hospital
within
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
would
say
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
statute
says
he
may
have
counsel,
the
second
circuit
in
the
carroll
case
where
they
held
a
portion
of
a
related
statute
unconstitutional
assumed
that
he
would
have
counsel.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
answer
is
he
doesn't.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
on
the
issue
of
the
whether
he
is
uniquely
dangerous,
no
he's
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
we
do
not
--
we
don't
claim
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
--
on
the
question
of
unique
danger.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
we
claim
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
a
general
question
of
insanity
to
which
all
other
persons
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
entitled.
as
to
the
question
of
right
to
representation,
it
doesn't
matter
what
kind
of
proceeding
we're
talking
about,
new
york
does
not
give
it,
except
in
connection
with
a
specific
criminal
charge
where
you
have
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
or
where
you
have
a
claim
made
that
the
defendant
cannot
stand
the
trial.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
it
does.
it
would
--
i
would
say
the
exception
would
be
if
the
release
were
a
conditional
release,
i
would
think
that
if
there's
unconditional
discharge
and
a
new
commitment
proceedings
brought,
then
the
statute
requires
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
i
do
not.
but
i
do
suggest
that
there
should
be
someone
other
than
the
commissioner
who
makes
that
decision.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
thank
you,
your
