mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
four
facts
that
i
would
like
to
establish
if
at
all
possible.
first,
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
is
retained
in
a
state
mental
hospital
and
not
in
a
prison,
and
for
that
reason,
the
expiration
of
his
prison
sentence
does
not
affect
his
continued
retention.
second,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
grouping
the
dangerous
criminally
insane
and
that
their
rights
under
due
process
and
equal
protection
are
fully
protected
by
the
state
of
new
york
with
meaningful
hearings
upon
due
notice.
third,
the
fact
that
their
rationale
of
the
gideon
versus
wainright
case,
assigned
counsel
whenever
the
patient
or
prisoner
or
defendant
does
not
have
the
money
to
get
counsel,
that
rationale
does
not
fit
the
special
circumstances
of
a
sanity
hearing
of
the
criminally
insane.
and
by
the
same
token,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
which
is
given
to
the
civilly
committed
for
good
reasons
--
again,
it's
not
applicable.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
is
there
an
appointment
of
counsel,
your
honor?
no.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
if
he
--
he
can
waive
a
jury
trial
but
he
can
have
one.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
it's
up
to
the
court
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
he
can
hire
one
and
it's
up
the
court's
discretion
in
some
cases
possibly
i
suppose
when
the
issues
are
many
and
complex,
the
court
may
well
assign
counsel.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
it
is
not
required,
your
honor.
the
fourth
and
final
fact
that
i
would
like
to
establish
is
that
actually
petitioner
is
a
member
of
this
group
of
criminally
insane
and
is
retained
in
--
properly
in
a
hospital
and
was
given
full
protection
under
the
equal
rights
and
due
process.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
your
honor
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
may
i
--
that
phrase
criminally
insane
is
used
more
among
psychiatrists
and
i
checked
that
very
carefully.
of
course,
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
insane
criminal
and
that
certainly
petitioner
was.
he
was
convicted
of
a
--
as
a
multiple
offender,
was
sent
to
prison
and
after
being
certified
as
insane,
was
then
transferred
to
the
new
york
hospital
for
the
felons
who
become
insane
while
they're
in
prison.
but
now,
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
but
he
--
then
when
he
served,
completed
the
sentence
he
was
no
longer
an
insane
criminal.
so
the
phrase
“criminally
insane”
is
applicable
to
him
after
his
sentence
expires
because
of
the
proclivities
and
tendencies
that
he
has
shown
by
his
record.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
criminally
insane
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
it's
the
present,
what
he
has
done
presently
in
--
while
he's
been
retained
and
the
potential
if
they
let
him
out.
in
other
words,
that
present
examinations
indicate
such
violence
if
he
were
to
be
released
or
discharged.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
the
two
combined
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
he
has
to
be
dangerous
currently.
and
he
did,
he
have
shown
that.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
he
is
dangerous
currently
and
that
he
is
not
suitable
for
transfer
to
a
civilly
insane
hospital.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
he
was
would
not
then
be
sent
to
dannemora
by
no
means.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
--
which
is
a
hospital
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
your
honor,
about
half
of
the
patients,
almost
half
of
the
patients
are
insane
criminals.
in
other
words,
they're
serving
their
sentences
technically
while
they
are
hospitalized
for
their
mental
condition.
the
other
half
are
patients
whose
terms
have
expired.
so,
we
just
have
to
make
some
kind
of
distinction
and
as
i've
indicated
before
in
checking
with
psychiatrist
that
is
the
term
used
that
--
i'm
referring
to
the
term
“criminally
insane”
as
meaning
those
who
are
violent
with
proclivities
or
tendencies
toward
criminality
even
if
they
have
never
had
a
record.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
you
mean
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
under
the
mental
hygiene,
well
yes,
he
would
--
he
wouldn't
be
--
demanded
a
trial
(voice
overlap)
by
jury
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
he
would
get
a
jury
trial
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
--
because
of
those
specific
statutes.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
no,
that
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
but
perhaps
i'm
confusing
the
court
in
this
respect.
when
i
talked
about
criminally
insane,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
man
in
your
hypothetical
case
who
has
been
taken
off
of
the
streets
and
because
he's
violent
or
dangerous.
he
is
committed
as
a
civilly
insane
person
even
though
he's
dangerous.
there
is
that
distinction,
it's
only
when
the
record
shows
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
clark
who
made
that
distinction
in
the
--
over
holser
case
that
those
who
are
criminally
insane
are
certainly
a
greater
risk
to
society
than
those
who
are
just
civilly
insane.
so,
the
man
was
picked
up
that
way.
he
may
be
sent
to
matteawan,
but
in
dannemora
there
are
only
those
who
have
been
convicted
and
a
few
civilly
insane
people
who
become
so
dangerous
and
violent
that
there
are
no
security
precautions
in
civilly
insane
hospitals
that
can
manage
them.
so,
they
send
those
to
dannemora.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
there
is
--
i
believe
there
is
one
institution
devoted
to
cases
of
that
kind
but
they
are
epileptics
that,
again,
are
not
criminally
insane.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
the
psychiatrist
of
the
state
have
assured
me,
no
they're
not
in
that
great
number.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
dangerous
to
themselves,
primarily.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
i
would
say
yes,
many
of
them
would
be,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
the
distinction
that
the
doctors
makes
us
that
this
record,
felonious
record,
his
entire
life
history
of
violence
is
such
that
you
cannot
say
that
he
is
the
average
epileptic.
his
last
offense
was
that
of
taking
of
an
ice
pick
to
a
detective's
face
without
any
provocation.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
of
course
is
one
that
can
be
taken
away
or
granted
by
statute
in
the
absence
of
any
constitutional
guarantee
of
common
law.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
that
is
my
position
that
he
is
not
similarly
situated,
not
this
petitioner
in
his
class
that
the
criminally
insane
are
not
similarly
situated
to
the
civilly
insane.
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
the
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
your
honor,
from
time
in
memorial,
i
suppose
that
no
insane
person
had
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
as
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
discriminatory.
alright,
in
the
case
of
a
civilly
insane
person
who
is
alleged
to
be
civilly
insane,
there,
a
jury
trial
as
i
think
i
try
to
point
out
in
my
brief,
so
many
side
issues
may
be
created
and
raised.
there's
a
danger
of
being
railed
into
a
hospital
or
framed
and
that
is
often
the
case.
so
there,
a
jury
trial
is
almost
a
necessity.
i
don't
see
how
--
whether
the
case
of
someone
where
there
is
a
presumption
of
insanity
that
it's
continued
over
period
of
time
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
yes.
my
perception
under
those
conditions,
he
wouldn't
have
to,
because
he's
not
--
it
isn't
a
continuing
insanity
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
your
honor,
i
--
accident
of
time
possibly
that's
all.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
quite
correct.
i
believe
that
what
happened
there,
--
there
was
a
discussion
about
his
being
sent
back
home
to
maryland
and
in
light
of
that
discussion,
doctor
kerr
was
asked
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
--
could
be
sent
to
a
civil
hospital.
naturally,
the
state
has
no
motive
to
keeping
these
people
who
were
there
because
of
the
gradual
expense
and
because
they
want
to
reduce
those
expenses
and
reduce
the
population
of
these
places.
so,
they
were
talking
about
that.
well,
that
all
petered
out
because
of
the
fact
that
his
family
down
in
maryland
did
not
want
him,
they
were
indigence
and
that's
when
kerr
was
talking
about
him
being
transferred
to
a
civil
hospital,
the
va
hospital.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
does
your
honor
interpret
that
as
a
straight
instruction
to
have
him
transferred
with
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
your
honor,
i
interpret
that
in
light
of
this
colloquy
about
baltimore
and
then
returning
to
baltimore,
the
entire
responsibility
of
releasing
him
as
the
court
pointed
out
was
not
the
court's,
that
was
the
responsibility
of
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
depending
upon
their
findings
or
whether
or
not
this
man
was
still
dangerous
and
should
not
be
let
out.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
extremely
violent.
his
entire
record,
although
it's
not
in
this
record
on
appeal,
even
as
recently
as
last
month
according
to
the
records,
daily
records
kept
on
this
man,
three
or
four
times
a
month,
he
would
attempt
to
assault
either
another
patient
or
one
of
the
attendants
and
it
was
not
always
because
of
an
epileptic
seizure.
the
fact
remains
that
oftentimes
it
would
be
over
civil
rights
question
and
causing
near
riots
there
in
the
last
couple
of
months
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
near
riots
among
the
patients
themselves.
you
see,
at
dannemora,
they
do
not
have
individual
cells.
most
of
the
patients
are
kept
in
wards
and
dormitories.
they
have
a
number
of
rooms
where
single
patients
are
kept,
but
for
the
most
part,
they're
kept
in
dormitories
about
20
or
30
and
40
patients
at
each
one.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
in
the
record?
it
is
--
it
is
to
the
extent
that
as
doctor
kerr
have
suggested
before
this
colloquy
that
we
read
about,
he
said
but
there's
no
organic
deterioration
of
his
brain
and
he's
liable
to
have
assaultive
tendencies
during
post
compulsive
periods
and
that
he
requires
continuing
care
and
treatment
in
the
hospital.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
only
in
these
hearings
where
doctor
kerr
said,
his
record
indicates
that
he
becomes
confused
and
he's
liable
to
have
assaultive
tendencies.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
his
record
does,
yes.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
i
can't
say
that
there
is
that
actually
in
plain
black
and
white
but
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
they
read
from
the
records
themselves,
that
is
the
daily
records
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
your
honor,
that
is
not
included
in
the
record
--
made
up
by
the
other
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
judge
sweeney
never
issued
an
order
for
his
transfer.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
no,
no.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
his
order
actually
--
excuse
me
your
honor,
but
his
order
actually
ordered
his
retention
in
dannemora
state
hospital.
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
by
statute
when
the
sentence
expires,
the
patient
is
automatically
transferred
to
the
custody
of
the
mental
hygiene
commissioner.
there's
nothing
that
the
court
has
to
do
with
that.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
yes,
but
that
is
--
that
is
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that's
not
entirely
true.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
your
honor,
will
you
say
he's
out,
you
mean
out
in
the
streets?
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that
man
out
on
the
streets
when
he's
picked
up,
he
certainly
may
have
a
jury
trial.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
yes
i
have
to
concede
that.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
a
former
convict,
in
other
words.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
yes.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
you
may
--
he
may
have
a
jury
trial.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
that
new
york
recently
repeal
the
statute
which
came
up
through
the
federal
courts
in
mcneill
case
in
which
that
precise
point
was
raised
that
the
statute
provided
for
incarceration
of
a
former
convict
being
picked
up
as
you
have
described
and
being
placed
in
matteawan
state
hospital
for
the
insane
on
the
basis
of
fact
that
he
had
a
previous
criminal
record
and
was
dangerous.
but
there,
he
was
not
allowed
to
any
jury
trial.
that
case
by
the
way
--
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
because
he
was
an
ex-convict,
yes.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
it
has
been
repealed,
yes.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
he
must
have
a
judicial
hearing
but
he's
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
no.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
we
do
distinguish,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
yes.
we
do.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
we
give
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
we
give
them
a
hearing
before
court
of
record.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
happens
is
that
usually
it's
the
supreme
court
judge
or
the
county
judge
or
surrogate
filling
in
for
especial
term
and
he
has
a
judicial
hearing
wherein
the
--
he
has
to
be
there
personally
and
the
court
assigns
two
psychiatrists
on
examining
physicians
to
examine
him
before
the
hearing
and
to
file
a
report
with
the
court
at
the
hearing
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
when
he's
in
the
hospital.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
no,
no.
when
he's
in
--
when
he's
in
prison
and
he
needs
to
be
transferred
to
dannemora,
the
warden
petitions
for
a
court
order
and
then
this
is
all
sentence
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that's
before
his
term
expires,
yes.
he's
been
just
a
criminal.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
before
he
is
transferred
--
he's
not
transferred
without
this
judicial
hearing.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
in
this
specific
instance,
as
i
remember,
he
was
transferred
from
prison
to
the
hospital
about
four
months
or
five
months
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
almost
six
months
before
the
expiration
of
his
term
and
he
was
certified
as
insane
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
i
believe
he
had
a
proceeding
judicial
hearing
under
the
old
section
383
which
was
subsequently
amended
or
repealed
and
substituted
by
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
it
did,
within
the
30
days
prior
to
the
expiration
of
his
sentence,
yes.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
they
were
followed
just
according
--
according
to
384,
he
had
a
judicial
hearing
with
two
court
appointed
qualified
examining
physicians
and
with
the
director
testifying.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
we're
talking
now
about
383,
the
old
383.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
384?
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
384?
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
that
proceeding
was
at
just
before
--
it
was
initiated
just
before
his
sentence
expired.
his
sentence
expired,
i
believe,
on
december
16th,
the
proceeding
--
this
particular
hearing
for
example
was
held
on
december
6,
1961,
10
days
or
so
before
his
sentence
expired.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
my
recollection
is
although
this
was
not
placed
an
issue,
his
initial
transfer
from
prison.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
the
normal
practice
(voice
overlap)
--
there
are
two
statutes
we're
talking
about,
383
which
provides
for
judicial
hearing
when
a
criminal
is
reputed
to
be
insane.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
383,
yes.
383.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
when
his
term
expires.
there
are
two
separate
statutes
and
each
provides
for
judicial
hearing.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
he's
not
given
exactly
the
same
type
of
proceeding,
no
your
honor.
he's
given
a
judicial
hearing.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
and
that
is
the
way
he
can
get
out
--
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
the
only
way
--
if
you're
referring
without
a
jury
trial,
yes.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
no,
he's
not
entitled
to
jury
trial.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
well,
i
can
only
go
reading
between
the
lines
of
that
statement
there
by
the
court.
it
would
seem
that
the
court
was
satisfied
that
this
man
was
still
dangerously
insane
and
that
it's
because
it
follow
that
up
with
an
order
retaining
him
judicially.
and
led
it
up
to
the
commissioner
of
mental
hygiene
and
whose
custody
was
to
determine
from
then
on
whether
they
were
going
to
--
the
commissioner
has
the
power
to
release
him
if
they
find
that
he
is
harmless
or
if
they
find
that
he
can
be
transferred
to
a
civilly
insane
hospital
without
doing
violence
to
anybody.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
he
asked,
yes.
mr.
anthony
j.
lokot
thank
you,
your
honor.
