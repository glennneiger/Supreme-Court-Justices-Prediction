i
have
a
little
trouble
with
your
defining
in
this
criminally
insane.
i
thought
of
that
as
some
who
commits
what
would
otherwise
be
criminal
offenses
but
which
are
not
because
he
is
insane
and
therefore,
he
cannot
be
convicted
and
sent
to
prison
and
yet
this
man
was
convicted
and
sent
to
prison
as
somebody
who
presumably
was
not
criminally
insane
but
was
simply
criminal.
justice

stewart
and
he
--
then
he
served
his
sentence
and
it
was
thereafter
that
he
was
committed
and
the
question
certainly
is
as
you
suggest
at
the
outset
does
not
whether
or
not
the
--
not
whether
he
can
be
held
at
a
hospital
if
he's
insane
but
how
he
got
there,
how
he
got
there,
how
he
was
put
there
as
compared
to
other
people
who
were
committed
in
your
state.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
just
about
to
serve
his
sentence.
