johnnie

petitioner
versus

herold,
director,
dannemora
state
hospital.
mr.
polsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lokot.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
an
epilepsy
hospital
in
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
a
hospital
for
epileptics
in
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
not
criminally
insane
as
a
point
that
you
have
used,
but
are
not
the
great
many
of
them
dangerous
at
times
after
they
have
passed
their
seizures
as
--
it
is
charged
this
man
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
epileptics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
aren't
they
aggressive
and
liable
to
be
violent
after
they
come
out
of
these
seizures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
many
of
them
would
be
yes,
but
why
wouldn't
this
man
--
this
man
who
is
only
said
to
be
slightly
aggressive
after
these
seizures
of
him,
why
wouldn't
he
be
subject
for
the
same
kind
of
treatment
as
these
other
epileptics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
all
your
people
whether
civilly
insane
or
criminally
insane
are
only
placed
in
restraint
because
a
lot
would
be
dangerous
either
to
themselves
or
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
see
how
this
man
differs
from
those
people
to
the
extent
that
he
isn't
given
the
same
kind
of
procedure
that
they're
given
before
commitment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
give
it
to
one
man
and
not
give
it
to
another
man
similarly
situated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
didn't
the
court
and
the
doctors
and
everybody
else
in
this
very
summary
proceeding
that
they
had
for
this
man
indicate
that
he
was
--
he
should
be
in
the
civil
hospital
instead
of
a
criminal
hospital?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
court
said
this,
addressing
the
patient,
“you
were
examined
by
doctor
foster
on
november
27.
he
is
a
representative
of
the
department
of
mental
hygiene.
he
will
make
a
report.
if
he
reports
that
he
thinks
you
were
subject
for
transfer
to
a
civil
hospital
then
you
will
be
transferred.
it
is
entirely
up
to
that
department.”
and
then
the
court
addressing
doctor
herold
who
represented
the
department,
“have
you
any
objection
that
this
man
is
transferred
to
a
civil
hospital
to
the
department
of
mental
hygiene?”
so
did
he,
“none,
whatsoever.”
the
court,
“and
i
sir,
agree
with
you.
i
have
no
objection
to
this
transfer
at
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
so
finds.”
then
he
said
--
ends
up
by
saying,
“i
hope
that
he
will
be
transferred
to
a
civil
hospital.
good
luck.”
hearing
closed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
like
your
interpretation
of
what
this
is.
i
just
read
it
to
you
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
that
he
had
been
assaulting
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
liable
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
show
any
actual
assaults
or
attempt
to
assault
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
said
this
record,
the
record
we
deal
with.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
a
hearing
do
they
get
when
they're
in
jail
like
this
man
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
some
(voice
overlap)
hearing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
takes
place
where
a
fellow
is
still
in
prison
or
this
only
takes
place
when
he's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
when
his
term
expires?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
those
terms
expired
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
immediately
after
his
transfer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
read
--
what
i
read
from
the
briefs
would
indicate
that
he
did
not
have
a
hearing
beforehand
and
that
this
was
after
his
term
expired,
he
was
taken
before
the
court
and
these
two
doctors
testified
and
then
the
court
says,
“do
you
have
any
question,
you
would
like
to
ask
to
doctor
herold,
mr.
baxstrom?”
the
patient,
“doctor
herold,
i
am
at
the
dannemora
state
hospital
since
june
1st?”
and
doctor
harold
says,
“yes,
you
came
to
our
hospital
june
1st.”
the
patient,
“i
asked,
i
know
that
it
is
a
mental
hospital,
am
i
right
but
i
don't
know
how
i
got
there.”
and
doctor
herold
says,
“you
don't
know
how
you
got
there,
you
were
sent
to
the
dannemora
state
hospital
by
an
order
of
transfer
signed
by
a.
j.
may
(ph)
acting
warden
of
attica
prison.”
the
patient
said,
“i
know
that
i'm
an
epileptic
but
i
did
not
know
that
this
is
a
form
of
insanity.
i
would
like
to
recommend
sir,
that
the
staff
of
the
hospital
review
my
case”.
wouldn't
that
--
and
the
judge
then
and
the
hospital
attendants
took
no
umbrage
of
that
apparently
--
apparently,
he
had
no
hearing
before
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
we're
talking
about
the
proceeding
under
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
484.
chief
justice
earl
warren
384.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here's
what
the
court
said,
at
that
particular
time,
right
before
the
--
right
before
the
end,
“the
question
before
me
today
baxstrom
is
only
what
the
doctors
who
are
at
the
hospital
and
the
doctors
i
set
have
to
examine
you,
believe
your
mental
condition
to
be
whether
you
stay
at
the
dannemora
state
hospital
or
whether
you
are
transferred
to
some
other
civil
hospital
at
or
near
your
home
is
entirely
up
to
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
doctor
herold
or
myself”.
now,
what
does
that
indicate
does
that
indicate
that
he
has
had
a
full
hearing
of
any
kind
to
determine
insanity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
polsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
polsky,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
for
responding
to
our
urging
that
you
represent
this
man
who
was
unrepresented
into
this
--
this
dilemma,
we
feel
that
that's
a
great
public
service
and
it's
greatly
appreciated
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
lokot,
we
appreciate
of
course
your
representation
of
the
interest
of
people
of
new
york.
