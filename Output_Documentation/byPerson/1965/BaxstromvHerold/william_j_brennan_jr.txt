justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
polsky,
may
i
ask.
i
understand
there
is
a
--
i
don't
know,
it's
a
new
or
revised
mental
hygiene
law
which
set
some
procedures
now
for
reexamination
of
the
propriety
of
retention,
is
it
a
voluntary
confinement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
this
--
would
this
petitioner
--
my
question
was,
could
he
have
the
advantage
of
that
new
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
until
then?
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
--
but
isn't
this
under
the
supervision
of
the
presiding
justice
from
the
appellate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
could
he
not
--
it's
a
question,
just
reading
the
statute
on
the
face
of
it,
might
appear
that
presiding
justice
of
the
appellate
division
could
require
it
in
the
case
of
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
even
the
aid
of
counsel
or
of
his
own
experts
on
whether
he
should
be
retained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
alright.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
lokot,
suppose
this
very
individual
had
served
out
his
prison
term
before
any
symptoms
of
the
mental
illness
and
then
he
have
been
released
and
a
year
later,
the
very
symptom
that
developed
here
showed
up
but
on
the
street
and
he
was
picked
up
on
the
street,
would
he
have
a
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
it's
just
the
accident
--
just
the
accident
that
this
developed
while
he
was
serving
the
prison
term,
which
denies
him
a
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lokot,
can
you
tell
me
why
it
was
--
judge
sweeney
as
i
understand
it
in
the
first
habeas
hearing
ordered
petitioner's
transfer
to
a
civil
institution
and
that
was
not
done
and
then
on
the
second
judge
sutton
was
it,
said,
“well,
that
was
an
administrative
matter
and
this
court
could
do
nothing
about
it.”
what
--
why
wasn't
he
wasn't
transferred
in
compliance
with
judge
sweeney's
--
is
that
an
order
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
an
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
no,
i
gather
it
was
only
a
claim
on
petitioner's
part.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
judge
sweeney
had
an
order
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
actual
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me,
mr.
lokot.
maybe
i
misunderstood
this,
but
i
thought
in
the
instance
of
this
petition,
there
was
no
proceeding
on
the
occasion
of
his
declaration,
initial
declaration
that
he
was
mentally
ill,
that
the
proceeding
in
which
you
speak
was
sought
to
section
384
which
applies
only,
i'm
quoting
the
statute,
“within
30
days
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
term
of
a
prisoner
confined
in
dannemora.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
did
he
have
any
kind
of
proceeding
--
preceding
that
transfer
except
some
administrative
of
proceeding
in
the
prison?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
did
he
have
another
one
within
30
days
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
--
and
were
those
procedures
the
same
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
383
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
383
that's
in
the
record,
isn't
it?
it
says,
whenever
the
physician
or
the
psychiatrist
of
any
--
one
of
the
state
institutions
shall
certify
that
the
warden
where
prisoner
is
in
his
opinion
mentally
ill,
the
warden
shall
apply
to
a
judge
in
the
court
of
records,
et
cetera.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
was
in
effect
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
when
384
was
invoked,
i'm
looking
at
page
2
of
the
record,
the
doctor
--
director
of
dannemora
in
the
petition
said
that
petition
--
that
the
patient
was
admitted
there
on
june
1,
1961
from
attica
prison.
that's
all
it
says.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
says
how
or
why
or
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
later
on,
there's
another
record
which
says
he
was
transferred
to
dannemora
pursuant
to
procedures
required
by
law,
that's
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
that
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
he
have
a
right
to
counsel
at
that
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
does
the
statute
say
that
he
does
or
doesn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
stage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
lokot,
i
can
see
that
i
understood
that
had
this
petitioner
not
developed
this
ailment
until
after
he'd
served
his
prison
terms,
and
then
going
to
pick
up
on
the
street,
everything
you'd
said
about
civil
commitment
would
have
follow
then
clearly,
confinement
initially
in
the
civil
rather
than
in
institutional
like
dannemora,
is
that
right?
