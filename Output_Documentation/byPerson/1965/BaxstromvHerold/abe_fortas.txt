justice
abe
fortas
did
it
say,
“like
all
epileptics?”
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
doctor's
script
could
say,
“like
all
epileptics?”
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
does
the
--
i
suppose
this
record
does
not
show
what
happened
with
respect
to
the
--
his
prior
offenses
on
whether
they
followed
epileptic
seizures?
justice
abe
fortas
i
remember
that
but
i
don't
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
second
question
i
want
to
ask
you
is,
i
notice
the
way
you
phrase
the
first
question
you
presented.
and
because
of
the
way
you
phrase
that,
i
want
ask
you
whether
it's
your
position
that
the
state
has
a
duty
to
assign
counsel
in
these
situations
or
whether
you're
limiting
your
position
here
to
proposition
that
he
should
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
obtain
counsel,
which
is
the
way
this
is
phrased.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
does
he
have
a
right
to
counsel
at
that
stage?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
it's
conceivable,
isn't
it,
that
the
question
that
we
have
before
us
is
a
statutory
question
not
constitutional
question?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it,
i'm
trying
to
shorten
the
time.
as
i
understand
it,
this
petitioner's
criminal
term
expired?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he
was
committed?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
i'm
asking
if
it
isn't
possible
that
what
we
have
here
or
what
new
york
court
may
have
had
before
it
was
a
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
did
not
guarantee
this
petitioner
the
rights
that
any
other
person
would've
had,
had
he
been
subject
to
civil
commitment
proceedings.
in
other
words,
that
his
rights
that
any
peculiarities
going
from
the
fact
that
he
was
a
criminal,
sees
that
the
exploration
in
the
sentence
and
then
question
is,
did
the
statute
applied
to
him
as
of
that
time?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
--
suppose
somebody
would
pick
up
on
the
street
and
the
civil
commitment
proceedings
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
this
type
is
uniformly
without
exception
testified
that
he
is
--
the
person
was
insane
and
mad,
they
were
confident
that
unless
confined,
he
would
commit
violence.
now,
would
he
then
be
criminally
insane
so
that
he
would
go
to
dannemora
rather
than
to
an
institution
under
the
jurisdiction
of
mental
hygiene
department?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
you
are
making
your
distinction
here
because
as
i
understand
it,
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
it's
been
raised
by
the
petitioner,
is
that
he
was
held
in
dannemora
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
is
for
the
“criminally
insane”,
that
is
to
say
those
people
have
been
convicted
by
a
crime
or
a
charge
with
the
crime
and
put
away
before
the
tracks
of
record.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
my
point
is
--
my
question
to
you
is
that,
you
get
two
types
of
persons
who
are
within
that
same
psychiatric
category
and
they
are
treated
differently
in
one
group
that's
--
here
is
someone
who's
criminally
insane
and
just
picked
up
in
the
streets,
this
type
is
criminally
insane
in
the
sense
that
you
described
and
he
gets
a
jury
trial,
he
may
have
a
right
to
counsel,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
you
picked
up
the
street
and
committed
a
crime
but
this
guy
said
that
he
is
“criminally
insane”
in
the
sense
that
he
is
a
person
who
in
their
opinion
will
bring
violence.
justice
abe
fortas
then
he
gets
a
jury
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
take
another
fellow
--
justice
abe
fortas
take
another
fellow
who
had
been
in
prison
and
then
presumably
became
insane
where
certainly
have
his
term
as
--
it's
alleged
happened
in
this
case,
he's
transferred
dannemora,
his
term
expires.
he
is
also
“criminally
insane”
in
the
sense
that
you
described
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
he
asked
for
a
jury
trial
and
he
didn't
get
it,
is
that
right?
