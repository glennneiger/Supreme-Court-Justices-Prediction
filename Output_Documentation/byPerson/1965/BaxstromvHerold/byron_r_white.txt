justice

r.
white
this
isn't
going
to
get
him
a
jury
trial
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
whether
he's
insane
or
this
is
going
to
get
him
a
decision
on
whether
he
should
be
in
dannemora
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
compared
to
some
other
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
will
get
none
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
counsel
in
the
civilly
committed
was
--
is
there
appointment
of
counsel
where
the
patient
is
indigent?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
the
patient
is
indigent?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
there's
a
jury
trial
if
he
wants
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
can't
hire
a
counsel,
he
doesn't
get
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
that
that's
--
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it
--
is
that
it
for
his
--
he's
categorized
as
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
criminally
insane
because
of
his
past
behavior
rather
than
his
--
his
present
potentiality?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
different
that
to
give
us
such
--
is
it
because
he
is
dangerous
or
are
you
suggesting
that
because
he's
dangerous
or
potentially
dangerous
because
of
his
insanity
rather
than
a
conclusion
which
follows
from
the
fact
he
has
committed
10
crimes
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
their
--
but
the
former
is
essential,
is
that
he
has
--
that
he
has
to
be
dangerous
currently.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
based
on
--
based
on
testimony
that
he
must
be
dangerous
--
testimony
of
doctors
that
in
their
opinion
he's
dangerous
currently.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
record
here
substance
--
substantiates
that
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
true
but
why
is
this
similarly
situated
with
regard
to
the
jury
trial
issue?
i
see
why
it
might
be
different
on
some
other
ground
but
with
regard
to
jury
trial,
isn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he'd
never
had
--
never
had
jury
passed
upon
his
insanity?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
we're
talking
about,
we're
talking
about
giving
it
to
one
--
to
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
his
order
to
commit
him
to
the
mental
health
commissioner?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
suggest
that
the
fellows
currently
in
prison
and
whom
the
administrator
of
the
prison
finds
to
be
insane?
that
fellow
may
not
have
a
jury
trial
before
he's
transferred
to
an
insane
asylum
out
of
the
prison.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
that's
right
and
so
you
do
distinguish
between
people
who
are
currently
in
jail
and
people
who
are
not
in
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
allegation
--
i
mean
your
suggesting
is
that
he
was
also
given
an
earlier
hearing
five
or
six
months
before
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
the
normal
practice
is
you
have
a
hearing
when
someone
is
misheard,
like
this
fellow
was,
while
he
was
in
prison.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
to
throw
away
the
hearing
until
his
term
expires.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
current
383?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
384
when
his
term
expires.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
the
new
york
right
to
jury
trial
apply
when
you
--
once
before
been
committed
that
you
can
release
as
cured
and
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
suggest
that
a
jury
should
second
guess
the
mental
health
commissioner
on
type
of
the
institution
on
which
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
unless
it
should
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
