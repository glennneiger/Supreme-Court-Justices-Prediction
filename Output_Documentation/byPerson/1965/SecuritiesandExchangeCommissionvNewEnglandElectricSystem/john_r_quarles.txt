mr.
john
r.
quarles
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
that
i
would
agree
with
a
great
deal
what
mr.
loomis
had
said
about
the
function
of
this
act
and
its
interpretation.
i
would
agree
with
him
that
the
sole
question
raised
is
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
substantial
economies
as
used
in
section
11
(b)
(1).
if
the
test
applied
by
the
commission
in
this
case
however,
had
been
as
i
understood
him
to
state
it
to
be,
i
do
not
think
we
would
have
been
here
today.
because
there
is
in
our
view
a
sharp
distinction
between
a
test
of
substantial
or
serious
or
significant
laws
which
i
understood
him
to
say
was
the
test
applied
and
the
test
as
stated
in
the
question
raised,
namely
the
test
of
capability
for
sound
and
economic
operation.
the
commission
has
not
explained
just
what
that
phrase
means.
we're
not
quite
sure.
reading
it
in
the
context
where
it
was
first
used
in
the
philadelphia
case,
we
think
it
means
economic
survival.
but
in
any
event
the
test
is
not
one
of
whether
on
the
overall
picture
there
has
been
economy
or
loss
of
economy
that
is
serious.
the
test
as
it
has
presented
in
this
case
is
the
ability
to
continue
in
sound
and
economic
operation.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
in
construing
it
is
the
test
one
of
serious
and
important
loss
of
economy
or
is
it
one
of
loss
of
economy
so
serious
that
a
continuation
to
operate
economically
becomes
impossible
and
there
is
the
principle
issue
between
us.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
whether
it's
phrased
negatively
or
positively
or
whichever
has
the
burden
we
come
back
to
the
crucial
difference
between
us
of
whether
the
test
is
to
be
one
of
really
serious
by
whatever
standards
you
measure
it,
looking
at
the
total
picture,
really
serious
which
we
agree
is
a
proper
test.
or
the
test
is
to
be
so
serious
that
continued
operation
sound
and
economically
becomes
impossible.
and
in
considering
this,
although,
you
have
the
same
words
in
the
two
sections,
i
think
that
it
is
essential
that
we
read
the
two
together
and
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that
briefly
before
going
to
the
substance
of
this
issue.
in
defining
the
circumstances
under
which
utilities
can
be
held
together,
the
act
specifies
the
three
basic
requirements
that
mr.
loomis
has
mentioned,
the
critical
one
for
our
purposes
here
being
economic
justification
that
must
be
substantial
economies
from
the
joint
operation.
these
requirements
as
you
said
are
parallel
and
appear
in
the
two
sections
as
applied
to
utilities
in
a
single
integrated
system.
they
are
in
2
(a)
(29)
and
as
applied
to
more
than
one
in
a
single
system,
they
appear
in
11
(b)
(1).
in
the
instant
case,
the
commission
was
required
to
apply
them
to
the
eight
gas
companies
of
the
new
system
under
both
of
these
sections.
first,
to
determine
under
2
(a)
(29)
whether
the
eight
gas
companies
could
be
held
together
with
each
other
as
a
single
system
then
under
11
(b)
(1)
to
determine
whether
they
could
be
held
together
with
the
electric
companies
in
a
single
holding
company
system.
as
was
pointed
out,
there
was
no
question
with
respect
to
the
geographic
or
the
size
requirements.
it's
a
small
system
relatively
speaking
in
a
very
compact
area
in
central
new
england.
they
were
clearly
met
and
the
commission
affirmatively
so
found
not
merely
conceded.
this
limited
the
inquiry
to
their
economic
aspect
of
it
and
they
are
the
keywords
in
the
two
sections
are
identical,
substantial
economies.
the
evidence
showed
that
combining
the
gas
companies
in
the
separate
system
affected
economies
of
$329,000
a
year
and
on
that
showing,
the
commission
conceded
that
they
met
the
test.
we
regard
this
as
necessarily
implying
a
finding
or
at
least
a
recognition
that
for
these
eight
gas
companies
in
this
situation
savings
of
$329,000
a
year
constitute
substantial
economies.
similarly,
the
evidence
showed
that
combining
that
system
with
the
electric
system
resulted
in
further
savings
of
a
$1,098,600
a
year
and
on
that
showing,
the
commission
held
that
savings
of
a
$1,098,600
are
not
substantial
economies.
the
findings
and
opinion
offered
no
explanation
of
this
rather
serious
inconsistency
as
we
view
it
nor
even
recognized
that
it
was
that.
the
petition
for
certiorari
tried
to
brush
it
aside
by
a
casual
reference
to
these
eight
gas
companies
which
concededly
are
a
single
system.
at
the
time
of
the
brief,
we've
petitioned
--
of
ours
was
sent
it,
our
brief
in
opposition,
we
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
agreement
between
the
parties
as
alleged
and
so
in
coming
in
with
their
later
brief
they
shift
their
grounds
somewhat
and
in
order
to
avoid
the
dilemma
they
come
in
with
what
to
me
is
a
very
surprising
suggestion.
i
read
from
page
9
of
their
brief,
the
commission
did
not
in
fact
adjudicate
the
issue
whether
there
were
substantial
economies
as
used
in
2
(a)
(29)
(b)
which
defines
integrated
gas
system
but
merely
accepted
it's
staff's
concession.
and
further
on
page
22,
the
commission
without
making
any
findings
thereon
decided
the
case
on
that
assumption.
this
concession
however,
"made
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
simplifying
the
decision
on
the
section
11
issue
cannot
fairly
be
treated
as
an
informed
determination
by
the
commission.”
in
other
words,
they
started
it
and
the
commission
is
not
responsible
for
it
for
obvious
reasons
that
it
is
not
an
acceptable
answer.
in
the
first
place,
the
status
of
these
eight
gas
companies
under
2
(a)
(29)
was
a
vital
issue
in
this
case.
it
was
specified
in
the
commission's
order
of
notice
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
corresponding
issue
with
respect
to
the
elected
companies
we
specified.
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
we
maintained
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
commission
not
only
to
adjudicate
it
but
to
state
its
subsidiary
findings
and
its
reasons.
it
did
exactly
that
in
the
case
of
the
electric
companies
reciting
that
although
there
was
no
opposition,
they
had
examined
their
voluminous
record
and
then
came
out
with
an
11-page
findings
and
opinion
followed
by
an
order.
as
i've
mentioned
a
moment
ago
in
the
gas
phase
of
the
case
under
clauses
b
and
c,
the
commission
made
the
finding
rather
than
merely
a
concession.
at
the
hearings
before
the
hearing
examiner,
counsel
for
the
staff
insisted
that
this
issue
had
to
be
settled
first
before
it
could
go
on
to
the
other.
so
that
all
along
the
line
in
the
administrative
portion,
this
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
issues
before
the
commission
that
had
to
be
set.
now,
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
and
i
think
that
is
quite
pertinent
here,
sir
because
when
you
are
dealing
with
gas
companies,
there
is
no
particular
advantage
in
the
interconnection.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
therefore,
there
is
no
bonus,
if
you
will,
for
interconnection.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
in
both
cases,
the
statute
has
posed
that
as
one
of
the
requirements
for
combining
separate
utilities.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
corresponding
definition
of
an
integrated
electric
system,
the
requirement
is
different.
you
do
not
require
substantial
economies
because
certain
advantages
flow
from
interconnection
itself.
if
--
ability
to
pull
your
power
to
ensure
a
better
service
and
other
direct
advantages
so
that
in
the
case
of
the
electric
companies
all
that
need
be
shown
is
that
they
maybe
operated
on
the
normal
conditions,
economically.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes.
whereas
to
combine
gas
companies
where
you
do
not
have
that
advantage
or
to
combine
two
electric
systems
which
are
not
capable
of
interconnection,
in
other
words,
if
you
are
taking
a
second
electric
company
as
your
additional
system
then
it
is
necessary
to
go
further
and
show
substantial
economies.
our
position
is
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
that
is
his
contention
and
it
is
based
on
his
basic
philosophies
if
the
act
reflects
a
public
policy
against
combination
of
gas
and
electric
utilities
and
against
the
combination
of
more
than
one
integrated
system
and
i
will
hope
to
come
to
that
a
little
later
in
the
argument.
but
at
the
moment,
i
would
like
to
focus
particularly
on
this
matter
of
the
meaning
of
the
critical
phrase
in
the
two
sections
and
our
contention
that
the
phrase
must
be
construed
consistently
in
the
two
sections.
not
only
is
the
context
the
same,
not
only
are
you
looking
at
the
question
of
what
is
gained
by
joint
operation.
that
framework
of
the
two
sections
is
similar
and
the
words
of
(2)
(a)
(29)
are
in
effect
incorporated
by
reference
in
11
(b)
(1).
actually,
the
definition
is
only
used
one
of
the
place
in
the
act,
so
this
is
a
principle
used
of
that
definition.
so
that
if
you
construed
those
two
words
differently
in
the
two
places
you
in
effect
are
giving
the
identical
words
different
meanings
used
in
the
same
sentence,
in
effect,
because
by
using
the
definition
in
11
(b)
(1)
you
are
picking
up
the
definition
and
it's
terms
from
(2)
(a)
(29).
the
commission
has
referred,
as
mr.
loomis
mentioned,
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
periodically
has
pointed
to
the
parallelism
between
the
two
sets
of
requirements
and
said
there
should
be
a
construed
consistency.
now,
coming
back
to
this
matter
of
the
concession
rather
than
dealing
with
it
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
the
commission
couldn't
in
good
conscious
concede
unless
it
was
a
fact.
if
it
was
making
this
as
a
concession
it
is
a
departure
from
it's
well-established
practice
of
not
adopting
the
opinion
of
counsel
back
as
early
as
the
north
american
case
where
there
was
an
effort
made
to
get
the
commission
to
go
along
with
an
agreement
reached
between
counsel
for
the
staff
and
counsel
for
the
commit
--
for
the
companies.
the
commission
said,
“the
concurrence
of
counsel
does
not
change
our
statutory
duties.
we
may
make
the
affirmative
findings
necessary
to
permit
retention
only
if
the
record
shows
that
such
retention
satisfies
the
criteria
of
section
11
(b)
(1).”
now,
as
a
--
and
final
resort
is
the
petitioner
now
does
take
the
position
as
mr.
justice
fortas'
referred
to
of
saying
that
this
is
alright
because
it's
permissible
to
apply
different
meanings
to
this
--
to
usage
in
the
two
context
and
that
brings
us
into
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
that
is
a
permissible
thing
in
trying
to
give
effect
to
an
assumed
policy
of
the
act.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i'm
saying
that
if
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
that
could
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
--
could
be
held
as
into
this
note?
mr.
john
r.
quarles
that
could
--
that
could
ever
be
held
as
an
additional
one
that
wouldn't
have
to
be
separated
and
that
is
one
of
the
difficulties
with
this
anomalous
situation.
is
that
if
the
gas
companies
do
have
to
meet
the
same
standard
and
do
meet
that
standard,
you
could
never
prove
that
they
were
incapable
of
standing
alone.
that's
one
of
our
difficulties
with
this
interpretation.
if
you
have
the
same
standard,
it's
a
different
result.
now,
this
aspect
of
the
case
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no,
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
just
the
opposite
sir,
because
if
the
gas
companies
meet
the
test
of
being
capable
of
independent
operation
then
they
cannot
be
retained.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
savings
must
be
substantial
on
the
overall
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i
would
expect
that
you
would
usually
be
able
to
make
some
savings.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
the
savings
that
was
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
no,
sir.
because
in
the
first
place,
the
savings
that
we're
talking
about
by
operating
the
gas
companies
together
with
each
other
may
not
be
the
same
as
the
savings
that
would
be
realized
by
operating
those
gas
companies
as
a
unit
together
with
the
electric
companies.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
there
are
many
ways
in
which
savings
can
be
realized.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
and
if
those
savings
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
there
is
a
good
opportunity
there
for
savings.
there
is
nothing
in
the
philosophy
or
theory
of
the
act
that
finds
that
objectionable
so
long
as
the
other
requirements
are
met.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
so
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i
think
it
is
open
to
question
in
each
individual
case
whether
on
the
total
showing.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
they
are
subs
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes.
whether
they
are
substantial
enough,
i
--
agreeing
with
mr.
loomis
that
it
is
an
issue
that
has
to
be
examined
carefully
and
that
it
isn't
just
savings
in
operating
expenses
but
you
have
to
take
into
account
other
offsetting
items
and
come
up
with
the
net
result
and
if
the
net
result
is
a
substantial
amount
of
savings
in
relation
to
the
size
of
the
business
in
giving
due
weight
to
contrary
factors
then
retention
is
permissible
and
we
find
nothing
in
the
history
or
the
wording
of
the
act
that
would
indicate
that
that
is
an
undesirable
result.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i
think
that
perhaps
the
normal
situation
and
certainly
the
situation
against
which
the
act
was
primarily
directed,
wasn't
that
tight
little
situation
where
you
have
an
electric
and
gas
operation
in
the
same
territory
and
capable
of
substantial
savings
since
we
have
in
ours.
it
was
concerned
with
these
enormous
organizations
spread
across
the
country
and
the
other
two
tests,
the
geographic
test
and
the
size
test
were
clearly
the
ones
that
were
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
congress
and
the
public
generally
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
law.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
i
would
hope
that
would
be
the
result.
yes,
sir.
because
i
can
see
in
that
situation
tremendous
advantages
as
was
testified
by
the
chairman
of
the
department
of
public
utilities
having
supervision
over
these
gas
companies
in
our
case.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
oh,
yes,
75%
of
the
territory
and
78%
of
the
customers
of
the
gas
companies
overlapped
the
electric.
and
that
rather
distinguishes
this
case
and
does
permit
very
substantial
savings.
reference
is
made
to
the
record
on
the
facts
and
we
needn't
get
in
to
that.
but
this
figure
of
the
1,089,000
was
after
various
deductions
and
was
the
minimum
figure
that
we
saw
in
it
as
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
we
found
that
the
principle
economies
actually
realized
were
in
operating
savings,
meter
reading,
service
offices
and
things
of
that
kind,
and
in
procuring
insurance
that
would
cover
the
entire
operation,
certain
things
of
that
kind.
if
there
were
not
the
overlap
certainly
in
the
normal
case,
you
wouldn't
have
anything
like
a
substantial
savings
as
you
do
in
the
situation
such
as
ours.
now,
we
maintain
that
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
it
was
essential
that
the
commission
determined
the
status
of
the
gas
companies
that
it
make
affirmative
findings
with
respect
to
him
and
that
it
give
its
subsidiary
findings
and
its
reasons.
and
we
suggest
that
on
this
basis
alone
aside
from
the
other
which
i
will
hope
to
come
to
it
immediately
after
recess.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
r.
quarles
well,
coming
now
to
the
question
of
the
interpretation
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
(a)
independently
of
(2)
(a)
(29),
may
i
emphasize
that
the
interpretation
of
the
word
substantial
economies
which
the
court
is
asked
to
affirm
is,
a
loss
must
be
such
as
to
render
the
additional
system
incapable
of
sound
and
economical
operation
independent
of
the
principle
system.
our
position
is
that
that
is
an
artificial
interpretation
that
is
not
warranted
that
the
clause
a
is
a
clear
statement.
the
words
are
plain,
everyday,
non-technical
words.
the
intended
meaning
is
obvious
and
there
is
no
occasion
for
going
outside
those
words.
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
chief
justice
warren
in
the
recent
richard's
cases,
we
must
of
course
start
with
the
assumption
that
the
legislative
purposes
expressed
by
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words
used.
we're
going
to
operate
within
the
framework
of
the
words
chosen
by
congress
and
not
to
question
the
wisdom
of
the
latter
in
the
process
of
construction.
the
commission's
test,
we
submit,
is
not
within
the
framework
of
the
words
chosen
by
congress.
it
is
in
effect
a
substitution
in
order
to
reach
the
result
that
the
commission
urges.
it
is
necessary
to
replace
substantial
economies
with
indispensable
economies
or
necessary
economies.
so
the
test
of
substantial
economies
requires
a
comparison
of
the
situation
after
separation
with
the
situation
before
separation
to
determine
the
magnitude
of
the
savings
whether
or
not
they
are
substantial
or
whatever
substantiality
is
tested.
the
test
suggested
by
the
petitioner
requires
no
comparison.
it's
an
absolute
test.
if
the
separate
additional
system
can
operate
or
if
it
cannot
be
shown
affirmatively
that
it
is
unable
to
operate
economically
and
efficiently.
then
it
must
be
divested
and
the
magnitude
of
the
loss
of
economies
and
the
seriousness
of
the
impact
on
investors
and
consumers
is
irrelevant.
it's
our
position
that
no
extraneous
factors,
however
persuasive
should
be
allowed
to
reach
that
kind
of
result.
the
words
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
addison
v.
holly
seem
particularly
appropriate.
he
says,
“the
idea
is
not
so
complicated
nor
its
english
speech
so
poor
that
words
were
not
easily
available
to
express
the
idea.
after
all,
legislation
when
not
expressed
in
technical
terms
is
addressed
to
the
common
run
of
men
and
is
to
be
understood
according
to
the
sense
of
the
thing
as
the
ordinary
man
has
a
right
to
rely
on
ordinary
words
addressed
to
him.
construction
is
not
legislation
and
must
avoid
that
retrospective
expansion
of
meaning
which
properly
deserves
the
stigma
or
judicial
legislation.”
certainly,
in
this
situation
english
speech
is
not
so
foreign
words
and
not
easily
available
to
express
the
idea
of
that
the
petitioner
is
suggesting
as
the
test
here.
all
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
to
change
the
long
and
involved
phrase
in
which
clause
knowledge
expressed
and
have
--
of
course
they
read,
a
each
of
such
additional
systems
cannot
be
operated
soundly
and
economically
as
an
independent
system.
it's
hard
to
believe
that
if
that
had
been
the
intent
of
the
expert
draftsman
of
the
act
they
would
have
used
words
which
ordinarily
have
an
entirely
different
meaning.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
inconceivable
that
intending
one
test
under
11
(b)
(1)
they
would
have
used
words
expressing
an
entirely
different
test
in
the
definition
which
at
the
time
they
were
incorporating
by
a
reference
into
11
(b)
(1).
now,
the
petitioners
undertake
to
justify
this
substitution
by
reference
to
the
history
and
design
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
to
the
great
difference
that
this
court
should
pay
to
the
commission's
determination
and
to
derive
a
noble
idea
that
the
test
should
be
designed
to
accomplish
the
desired
result
rather
than
determining
what
the
test
is
and
then
applying
it.
and
all
of
these
they
say
is
by
way
of
implementing
a
policy,
an
overriding
policy
that
is
so
strong
that
it
warrants
whatever
distortion
of
the
words
maybe
necessary
to
give
it
full
effect.
and
yet,
a
careful
analysis
of
the
act
itself
and
of
the
legislative
history
gives
no
support
for
any
such
philosophies
that
has
been
expressed.
first
place
of
course
is
to
look
at
the
act
itself
and
i
think
that
anyone
will
agree
that
an
unprejudiced
reading
of
the
act
would
not
suggest
any
such
philosophy.
section
1
enumerates
the
specific
evils
against
which
the
act
is
directed
and
announces
the
policy
to
overcome
those
evils
by
simplification
under
section
11
(b)
(2)
primarily
and
by
eliminating
those
properties
that
are
inimical
or
cause
difficulty
impairing
out
the
policy.
there's
no
suggestion
of
a
policy
against
combinations
that
meet
the
test
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
test
shouldn't
be
read
fairly
in
accordance
with
the
simple
words
in
which
it's
expressed.
it's
also
interesting
to
note
that
under
either
of
the
original
bills,
house
or
senate,
needs
would've
been
permitted
to
retain
its
gas
companies.under
the
senate
bill
because
under
that
definition
you
could
have
in
a
single
integrated
system
both
gas
and
electric;
under
the
house
bill
because
there
you
could
have
any
number
of
additional
systems
if
they
were
found
by
the
commission
to
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
only
support
that
is
claimed
for
this
philosophy
from
the
wording
of
the
act
itself
is
two
phrases
from
section
1
taken
out
of
context
and
we
think
completely
misconstrued.
on
page
17
of
petitioner's
brief,
we
find
this
statement,
retention
was
permissible
if
it
resulted
in,
“the
integration
and
coordination
of
related
operating
properties”
in
citing
1
(b)
(4)."
under
a
management
single-mindedly
devoted
to
the
development
of
those
related
properties
and
“free
and
independent
competition”
citing
section
1
(b)
(2).
now,
actually
section
1
(b)
(4)
suggest
two
alternatives,
economy
of
management
and
operation
or
the
integration
and
coordination
of
related
operating
policies,
economy
of
management
and
operation,
the
part
that
refers
to
our
type
of
situation
and
with
which
we
clearly
comply
was
omitted.
the
court
below
took
this
rather
seriously.
similarly,
if
we
read
section
1
(b)
(2)
in
it's
entirety
this
quoted
phrase
“free
and
independent
competition”
applies
only
to
purchases
by
public
utilities
of
services,
materials
and
so
on
to
assure
them
of
the
minimum
prices
and
doesn't
by
any
search
of
the
imagination
relate
to
competition
between
utilities
as
suggested
by
the
petition,
both
in
oral
and
in
their
brief.
the
same
we
think
misleading
reference
to
this
partial
quotation
that
appears
elsewhere
in
the
brief.
there
is
an
argument
in
the
brief
it
hasn't
been
adverted
to
in
oral,
to
the
effect
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
specification
of
the
properties
in
a
proviso
warrants
a
strict
reading
against
retention.
that
i
think
ignores
the
historical
development
of
this
clause.
as
was
pointed
out,
the
original
bills
provided
for
a
single
system
as
that
was
found
unsatisfactory
and
unacceptable
to
the
house
and
the
total
exclusion
was
whittled
away
just
as
a
matter
of
convenient
drafting
mechanics.
the
use
of
a
proviso
was
the
obvious
thing
and
certainly
no
particular
significance
to
--
should
attach
to
that.
certainly,
it
doesn't
warrant
reading
it
other
than
in
accordance
with
its
language.
likewise,
if
we
refer
to
the
legislative
history,
you
find
nothing
that
will
really
support
this
concept
of
separating
gas
and
electricity.
when
mr.
roosevelt
asked
for
remedial
legislation
in
this
field,
a
single
bill
drafted
by
the
national
power
policy
committee,
it
was
filed
in
both
houses
and
that
as
i
indicated,
provided
for
a
single
geographically
and
economically
integrated
system.
the
primary
concern
as
i
mentioned
this
forenoon
was
for
the
size
and
power,
and
geographic
spread
rather
than
for
whether
it
was
gas
or
electric.
the
indication
was
that
this
was
something
of
--
primarily
of
concern
to
the
individual
states
and
should
be
left
to
state
policy.
an
argument
was
made
this
morning
that
the
change
in
section
8
had
a
bearing
on
this.
actually,
section
8
so
far
as
it
pertains
to
this
problem
all
the
way
through
relates
solely
to
those
combinations
which
in
substance
violates
state
policy
and
section
8
in
it's
earlier
form
and
it's
present
form
is
designed
merely
to
prevent
the
use
of
the
holding
company
structure
as
a
means
to
get
around
a
state
prohibition.
the
two
bills
in
congress
took
divergent
courses.
in
the
senate,
under
the
leadership
of
senator
wheeler,
a
very
strict
interpretation
was
favored
and
limitation
strictly
to
a
single
assessment.
in
the
house
more
liberal
attitude
developed,
the
two
came
to
an
absolute
stalemate
and
as
the
session
was
nearing
an
end
in
order
to
effect
a
--
to
get
any
legislation
through,
the
senate
agreed
to
this
compromise.
mr.
loomis
referred
to
the
fact
that
senator
wheeler
was
the
author
of
the
bill.
well,
he
certainly
had
a
part
in
the
drafting
of
the
bill
but
it
is
clear
from
the
reading
of
his
own
speeches
and
the
comments
of
others
that
he
wanted
a
strict
bill
and
that
this
kind
of
a
concession
was
not
to
his
liking.
his
own
statement
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
its
face
i
think
shows
that
it
shouldn't
be
give
the
--
given
the
interpretation
that
is
now
proposed
for
it.
he
refers
to
a
system
so
small
that
it
couldn't
survive
and
that
this
is
the
economic
test
under
clause
a,
size
is
the
(inaudible)
with
under
clause
b
and
c.
but
with
no
greater
support
from
the
legislative
history
than
this,
the
petitioner
goes
on
to
the
conclusion.
in
short,
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
contemplated
by
congress
was
such
a
loss
as
would
render
the
additional
system
incapable
of
sound
and
economical
operation
independent
of
the
principle
system.
now,
we
contend
that
even
if
the
language
were
capable
of
the
interpretation
that
is
proposed
for
it
and
we
insisted
it's
not
that
there
isn't
sufficient
evidence
in
the
history
or
the
wording
to
warrant
that
distortion.
we
submit
that
the
compromise
that
was
affected
was
a
real
compromise
so
sincerely
that
it
was
properly
expressed
by
the
words
of
the
proviso
and
that
the
people
that
voted
for
that
compromise
had
a
right
to
start
those
words
to
be
given
their
normal
interpretation
rather
than
an
artificial
one
that
is
most
repugnant.
the
report
of
the
managers
to
the
house
that
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief
supporting
them
is
support
for
their
position
only
if
real
economic
need
which
was
used
in
that
report
is
equivalent
to
real
economic
necessity.
and
this
i
think
points
out
the
real
difference
between
us,
the
real
issue
before
this
court
at
the
present
time.
is
it
a
matter
of
serious
important
loss
of
economy
or
is
it
a
matter
so
serious,
so
important
that
continued
economic
operation
becomes
impossible.
now,
we
talked
about
senator
wheeler's
part
in
this,
he
was
prejudiced.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
words
that
he
used
do
not
indicate
a
proper
approach
to
have
this
test
under
a
was
to
b.
in
other
words,
it's
our
suggestion
that
he's
comments
really
have
no
relevance
to
this
issue.
let
we
come
to
the
question
of
administrative
interpretation
and
the
petitioner
claims
that
great
deference
is
due
to
the
commission's
long-standing
interpretation.
first
of
all,
that
assumes
that
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
word
and
that
it
has
been
consistently
applied
through
the
years.
if
this
were
a
fact,
we
would
certainly
agree
that
this
court
should
give
it
careful
consideration
even
then
it's
a
question
how
much
we
should
attached
to
it
because
this
isn't
the
kind
of
a
question
on
which
administrative
experience
or
expertise
is
particularly
needed
or
useful
as
compared
with
the
judgment
of
the
court,
but
fundamentally
the
basic
assumption
is
an
unsound
assumption.
the
commission's
decisions
and
even
the
court's
decisions
dealing
with
them
or
rather
confusing
and
frustrating.
it's
hard
to
classify
them
or
to
evaluate
them
because
of
this
very
loose
use
of
words
that
has
characterized
the
whole
history
of
this
thing
in
the
commission.
on
the
--
the
variety
of
the
words
is
such
that
in
any
particular
case
it's
difficult
to
be
sure
on
just
what
the
commission
is
basing
its
decision.
in
our
brief
on
pages
44
and
45,
we
have
listed
eight
versions
of
the
test.
i
apologize,
sir,
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
brief
at
that
point,
items
three
and
five
duplicate.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
that
is
on
page
45
of
our
brief.
there
are
however,
correcting
that
error,
there
are
eight
different
versions
of
the
test
that
has
been
stated
in
this
case
and
with
that
it's
not
surprising
that
the
court
below
had
to
spend
considerable
time
in
determining
what
the
decision
was
before
getting
to
the
point
of
whether
or
not
it
was
right.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
three
and
five.
mr.
john
r.
quarles
yes.
if
you
just
delete
five,
i'll
appreciate
it.
now,
the
petition
for
certiorari
erroneously
stated
that
all
of
the
previous
cases
under
11
(b)
(1)
had
applied
the
same
test
and
that
under
that
test
over
$2
billion
of
assets
had
been
ordered
divested.
our
brief
and
our
position
called
attention
to
the
error
in
that
statement
and
pointed
out
that
over
half
of
that
amount
was
divested
in
cases
applying
the
original
north
american
test
which
is
that
it
must
be
serious,
not
that
it
must
render
economical
operation
impossible.
that
another
large
block
was
divested
under
cases
where
the
evidence
wouldn't
support
any
test
and
no
test
was
even
mentioned
by
the
commission,
and
that
only
three
cases
out
of
the
14
had
specified
this
test.
those
three
representing
less
than
7.5%
of
the
total.
well,
the
petition
now
says
that
at
least
we
admit
that
since
the
philadelphia
case,
there
has
been
no
different
statement.
and
i
think
probably
that's
technically
accurate
but
i'm
afraid
it's
a
little
misleading
because
since
philadelphia
there
have
been
just
three
cases.
this
in
utility's
case
when
the
evidence
wouldn't
support
any
finding
and
no
test
was
mentioned.
the
gpu
case
in
which
counsel
had
worked
out
a
solution
to
the
problem
and
gpu
did
not
oppose
the
entry
of
the
order,
middle
south
in
which
there
was
opposition
but
the
only
evidence
was
the
opinion
testimony
of
the
president
not
backed
up
by
any
scientific
study.
so
that
actually
since
philadelphia,
nothing
of
significance
on
this
point
has
happened
at
the
commission
level.
but
in
the
meantime,
this
problem
has
been
considered
by
two
circuit
courts
of
appeals.
the
fifth
circuit
considered
it
in
the
case
that
was
later
reversed
on
jurisdictional
grounds
only.
the
first
circuit
in
this
and
those
six
judges
unanimously
rejected
this
test.
another
very
puzzling
aspect
of
this
thing
to
me
is
that
in
all
of
these
recent
cases,
the
commission
has
carefully
computed
the
ratio
of
the
prospective
losses
to
various
factors,
the
operating
revenues,
revenue
deductions,
gross
profit,
net
profit
in
terms
of
percentages,
and
was
gradually
building
up
tables
showing
a
comparison
of
those
cases.
and
in
this
case,
the
same
thing
was
done
and
it
was
stated
that
those
ratios
were
relevant.
and
yet,
if
the
test
is
the
absolute
test
of
the
ability
to
survive
economically,
this
test,
so
far
as
i
can
see
these
ratios
have
no
relevance
whatever
and
comparisons
with
other
cases
and
the
ratio
is
where
would
seem
to
be
meaningless.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
although
the
commission
has
stated
that
it
is
applying
a
single
test.
it
has
actually
applied
several
tests
and
that
it
has
confused
two
different
categories
of
test,
one
lot
bearing
as
to
the
emphasis
or
the
amount
of
substantiality,
of
a
comparative
test.
the
other
one
represented
by
the
philadelphia
case
and
by
this
case
an
absolute
test
of
survival
economically.
the
words
that
are
used
through
this
various
cases
are
not
synonymous.
the
test
are
not
the
same
and
in
attempting
to
phrase
it
in
this
various
ways
which
mr.
loomis
referred
to
is
merely
difference
in
phrasing.
i
think
that
it
does
not
conceal
the
fact
that
fundamentally
these
are
different
tests.
my
time
is
not
going
to
permit
me
to
deal
with
the
question
of
their
suggestion
of
using
this
test
because
it
permits
a
meaningful
consideration
of
the
competition
feature.
i
would
just
say
that
we
have
three
difficulties
with
that
test.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
mentioned
before,
it
hardly
seems
appropriate
to
choose
a
test
on
the
basis
of
--
it's
enabling
you
reach
the
result
that
you
want
to
reach.
normally,
you
determine
what
the
test
is
going
to
be
and
then
let
the
chips
forward,
i
mean,
in
applying
that
test.
the
second
thing
is
that,
it
assumes
that
competition
itself
is
bad.
that
is
a
very,
very
large
assumption
that
is
unwarranted
by
the
history
of
this
act.
it
is
a
thing
that
should
be
left
to
the
states
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
local
conditions.
in
some
places
competition
is
good.
in
some
it
is
not
good.
in
the
third
place,
they
have
not
shown
how
that
guess
is
any
easier
for
application
than
the
test
of
substantial
economies.
our
position
can
be
summarized
quite
briefly.
it
says,
and
first,
“the
commission's
handling
of
the
issue
under
2
(a)
(29)
(b)
was
so
inadequate
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
was
so
inconsistent
with
the
requirements
of
the
holding
company
act
inconsistent
with
it's
order
of
notice
in
this
case
with
the
commission's
own
established
practice.
if
there
was
to
be
a
change
in
that
established
practice,
we
should
have
known
about
it
at
the
time
and
with
it's
handling
of
other
issues
in
the
same
case
both
the
electric
(inaudible)
company
situation
under
2
(a)
(29)
(b)
and
clauses
b
and
c
under
11
(b)
(1).
in
the
second
place,
the
holding
company
act
is
a
clear
and
ambiguous.
it
sets
forth
a
comprehensive
self-consistent,
workable
regulatory
scheme.
there's
no
reason
for
distorting
its
normal
meaning
and
trying
to
impose
on
it
an
artificial
construction.
the
test
that
is
urged
by
the
petitioner
is
not
within
any
normal
or
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
language
of
this
act.
third,
the
assumption
of
this
overriding
federal
policy
against
common
control
of
gas
and
electric
utilities
which
apparently
dominates
the
thinking
of
the
commission
throughout
and
on
which
the
petitioner's
case
so
largely
rest
is
not
warranted
by
anything
in
the
statute
or
its
legislative
history.
and
fourth,
the
test
stated
by
the
commission
in
its
previous
decisions
and
in
the
present
case
represent
a
variety
of
interpretations.
any
apparent
uniformity
among
them
depends
on
treating
synonymous
words
that
have
really
normally
very
different
meanings.
there
is
no
single
test
which
has
been
consistently
applied
and
can
be
regarded
as
the
commission's
tests
to
which
this
court
should
give
serious
deference.
and
for
this
several
reasons,
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit.
