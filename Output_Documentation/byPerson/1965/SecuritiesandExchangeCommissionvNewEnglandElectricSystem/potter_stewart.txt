there
isn't
a
meeting
of
the
minds
between
you
and
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
as
to
how
well-establish
this
so-called
commission
standard
is?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
you
hypothesized
a
situation
with
which
they
don't
agree,
isn't
it
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
referred
to
the
well-established
commission
standards.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
question
that
there
is
any
such
thing,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
what
is
the
proper
test
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
say
a
duplicated
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
three
and
five.
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
you
saying
pretty
much
that
it
cannot
be
operated,
if
it
cannot,
cannot
means
cannot
be
operated
soundly
and
economically,
i
suppose
in
a
capitalistic
system
with
private
ownership,
it
means
it
cannot
be
operated
independently,
doesn't
it?
they're
very
long?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
that
you
say
is
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
you're
backing
away
from
that
test
and
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
if
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
long
as
you
have
private
ownership.
doesn't
that
mean
that
it
cannot
be
operated
very
long,
period?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
non-economic.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
which
one?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
same
one
on
those
two
pages?
