justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
loomis
when
you
--
when
the
commission
is
deciding
whether
to
allow
electric
and
gas
companies
to
stay
together,
in
making
that
judgment
do
you
inquire
at
all
or
predicted
all
what
will
happen
to
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
interested
in
that,
i'm
administering
the
question
you
have
in
this
case
whether
the
--
whether
they
can
retain
the
two
systems
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
in
making
that
this
decision
which
was
made
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
there
any
prediction
or
consideration
whether
the
rates
would
go
up
or
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
both
systems?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
going
to
be
if
they
--
if
some
--
if
a
regulatory
body
has
been
doing
its
job
on
the
rates
and
you
had
the
expenses
of
a
million
or
whatever
--
a
million
dollars
a
year
whatever,
why
wouldn't
the
rates
have
to
go
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
it's
irrelevant
--
apparently
it's
just
irrelevant
to
raise
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
if
they
would
go
up
a
million
dollars?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
commission
decide
in
this
case
was
a
--
try
to
decide
whether
rates
would
or
wouldn't
go
up
and
if
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
how
much
and
therefore
put
this
factor
into
the
balance
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
it
be
and
why
would
it
be
under
your
test
and
unless
--
because
rates
--
if
rates
can
go
up
and
will
go
up,
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
interference
with
the
sound
the
--
the
economical
operation
under
your
care?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
it
be
--
(voice
overlap)
wholly
irrelevant
to
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
quarles,
can
i
ask
you
please.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you're
you're
saying
that
whenever
there
are
substantial
enough
economies
among
several
gas
companies
so
you
could
pick
them
as
a
single
integrated
system
under
2
(a)
(29).
that
automatically
means
that
there
is
a
substantial
economies
which
prevents
it
being
operated
--
being
separated
from
the
gas
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
when
would
you
ever
have
a
--
when
would
you
ever
have
a
single
integrated
gas
companies
that
should
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
ever
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
ever
be
separated
--
ever
be
separated
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
have
to
though
--
but
don't
you
have
to
be
pretty
clumsy
not
to
be
able
to
save
some
money
by
operating
two
systems
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to
be
pretty
clumsy
not
to
make
some
substantial
savings.
you
just
add
personnel
or
billing
or
meters
or
something
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
no
separation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
i
would
say
--
my
point
is
wouldn't
there
almost
automatically
be
savings
in
operating
gas
companies
with
electric
companies
just
in
terms
of
--
you're
not
going
to
lose
any
money
doing
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
in
almost
any
kind
we
have
--
you're
operating
two
integ
--
two
integrated
systems
together,
gas
and
electric.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there's
--
at
least
if
you're
serving
the
same
customer.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
i'm
just
saying
that
since
that
is
so
--
since
it
would
be
so
repetitively
true
that
you
would
be
making
savings
by
operating
gas
and
electric
companies
together
that
it
would
be
the
rare
case
when
you
--
whatever
have
a
valid
separation
order
under
your
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
whether
its
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
substantial
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
it
--
what
--
it
reduces
the
act,
the
saying
is
that,
well,
normally
we
separate
them
but
normally
we
don't
because
of
--
if
the
normal
result
of
operating
an
integrated
grass
company
--
gas
company
along
with
an
integrated
electric
company
is
to
make
substantial
saving.
why
--
normally
you're
not
going
to
separate
them
under
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
(inaudible)
where
the
gas
--
i
mean,
the
gas
system(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here,
substantial
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
loomis,
you
announced
your
version
of
the
test
here,
do
you
--
is
that
the
test
the
commission
fairly
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
these
various
versions
of
the
test
referred
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
page
45
of
this
brief.
those
aren't
just
imaginary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
one
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
companies
that
are
unsound
just
go
right
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
a
--
there's
--
which
one
of
these
tests
says
a
lost
is
substantial
unless
it
would
render
impossible
economical,
and
efficient
operation.
now,
you
reject
that
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
cannot
and
impossible
are
the
same,
those
are
synonyms.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
the
commission
tell
us
what's
the
test
thereof?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
in
your
opinion
where
they're
deciding
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
test
you're
--
that
you
proposed
for
us
to
--
that
you
want
to
prove
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
it
the
one
you
stated
a
while
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
volume
is
that
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one
in
the
opinion
brief?
