justice

fortas
mr.
loomis,
do
you
understand
that
the
respondent
agrees
that
if
we
should
conclude
that
the
commission's
standard
is
correct
then
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
substantial
--
substantiality
of
the
evidence
supporting
the
commission's
result?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
plea
should
find
that
the
commission's
standard
is
correct
and
we
would
have
to
remand,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
hadn't
ruled
on
that
one
way
or
the
other,
has
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
a
remand
would
be
necessary
if
we
should
agree
that
the
commission's
standard
is
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
loomis,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
have
--
may
have
missed
your
point.
has
the
commission
ever
permitted
and
integrated
a
holding
company
to
retain
both
the
gas
--
an
integrated
gas
system
out
of
an
integrated
electric
system?
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
understand
the
--
perhaps
i
misconstrued
mr.
loomis'
statements
mr.
quarles,
i
didn't
understand
him
to
concede
that
that
was
the
issue.
that
is
to
say,
i
thought
his
position
was
that
it's
not
merely
a
matter
of
construing
those
words
substantial
economies
as
they
appear
in
the
11
(b)
(1)
(a)
that
the
question
was
to
construe
that
entire
subsection
in
light
--
and
to
construe
it
in
light
of
the
broader
general
provisions
of
the
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
his
point
was
that
the
11
(b)
(1)
(a),
there
is
really
a
maintenance
stated
negatively
and
in
--
and
is
referenced
by
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
that
the
question
is
whether
there
has
been
a
showing
in
this
record
as
determined
by
the
sec
that
the
gas
utility
system
cannot
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
rather
than
whether
substantial
economies
result
from
the
retention
of
the
gas
utility
system.
it's
kind
of
a
--
an
abstruse
difference
but
perhaps
in
legal
terms,
i
wonder
if
it
is
--
may
not
be
a
substantial
difference
with
respect
to
burden.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
quarles
--
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
i
had
--
i
don't
quite
cover
this,
2
(a)
(29)
has
a
separate
definition
of
an
integrated
utilities,
electric
utility
system,
separate
definition
of
an
integrated
gas
utility
system,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
words
on
which
you
are
relying
appear
only
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
the
integrated
gas
utility
system?
justice
abe
fortas
they
do
not
appear
in
the
definition
of
the
integrated
electric
utility
system.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
understand
that.
in
2
(a)
--
in
(b)
of
--
2
(a)
(29),
the
--
what
congress
is
talking
about
is
substantial
economies
that
may
be
affected
by
being
operated
as
a
single
coordinated
system,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
it
is
theoretically
conceivable
anyway
that
there
might
be
a
determination
that
substantial
economies
would
be
affected
as
a
result
of
allowing
the
gas
utility
system
to
be
operated
as
an
entity.
but
that
--
it
might
not
necessarily
--
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
perhaps
that
same
type
that
the
economies
would
--
that
a
finding
as
to
such
economies
would
also
apply
to
11
(b)
(1)
(a)
because
there
you're
talking
not
about
an
integrated
--
single
integrated
gas
utility
system.
talking
about
the
economies
which
are
urged
to
follow
from
the
operation
of
that
gas
utility
system
by
holding
company
which
is
--
also
owns
an
integrated
electric
utility
system.
so
my
--
and
my
question
rather
is
to
test
the
validity
of
a
proposition
that
the
2
(a)
(29)
use
of
that
phrase
has
the
same
implication
as
it's
used
in
11
(b)
(1)
(a).
justice
abe
fortas
economically?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
what
bothers
me
is
the
relevance
of
the
gas
utilities
standard
to
the
11
(b)
(1)
(a)
inquiry
and
as
i
understand
this
voluminous
as
argument.
it
is
that
the
11
(b)
(1)
(a)
inquiry
is
substantially
broader
than
the
inquiry
under
(2)
(a)
(29)
(b).
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
perhaps
--
perhaps
mr.
quarles,
my
brother
white
stated
this
point
which
is
troubling
me
as
an
analytical
matter
that
i
have
no
idea,
that
is,
if
2
(a)
(29)
is
to
be
carried
over
to
11
(b)
(1)
(a)
then
i
--
its
sort
of
a
--
it
would
automatically
follow
in
very
case,
wouldn't
it?
that
a
holding
company
which
has
an
electric
utility
system
can
retain
the
integrated
gas
utility
system
that
--
and
it
follows
this
automatically
as
saying,
if
you
add
one
and
one
and
one,
you
get
three?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that's
the
point.
that
is
if
the
--
do
you
say
you
have
an
integrated
gas
utility
system
then
under
2
(a)
(29)
you're
saying
that
there
are
substantial
economies
that
they
carried
that
over
to
11
(b)
(1)
(a)
then
it
would
follow.
if
i
correctly
understand
your
argument
that
in
every
case
where
there
is
--
where
a
holding
company
owns
an
integrated
electric
system
it
can
also
retain
the
integrated
gas
system.
justice
abe
fortas
what
page
is
that
mr.
loomis?
