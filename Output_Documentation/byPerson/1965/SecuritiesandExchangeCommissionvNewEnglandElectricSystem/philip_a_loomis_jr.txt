mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
the
final
stage
of
fairly
extensive
proceedings
to
determine
what
action
if
any
was
needed
to
bring
the
public
utility
system
of
respondent
new
england
public
--
new
england
electric
system
into
compliance
with
the
requirements
for
section
11
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
of
1935.
section
11
in
turn
is
the
integration
and
simplification
provision
which
has
been
characterized
by
this
court
and
in
the
congressional
reports
as
the
heart
of
the
act.
in
prior
proceedings
it
was
determined
that
the
principle
system
of
respondent
is
its
electric
system
which
meets
the
requirements
of
section
11.
the
issue
in
the
present
proceeding
is
whether
it
could
also
retain
its
gas
system.
this
in
turn
was
found
to
depend
upon
whether
or
not
within
the
meaning
of
a
proviso
contained
in
clause
a
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
of
the
act,
the
gas
system
cannot
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
which
can
be
secured
by
the
retention
of
such
control
by
such
pol
--
public
--
such
holding
company
of
said
system.
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
erred
in
rejecting
the
commission's
established
and
theretofore
judicially
approved
interpretation
of
clause
a
in
specifically
of
the
phrase
substantial
economies
and
in
substituting
it's
own
noble
and
far
more
lenient
interpretation.
the
commission
held
in
line
with
its
prior
cases
and
with
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
substantial
economies
means
not
a
mere
saving
and
expenses
which
in
almost
every
instance
will
recur
--
occur
from
combined
operations
but
rather
economies
which
are
substantial
in
relation
to
the
ability
of
the
gas
companies
to
operate
independently
in
a
sound
and
economical
way
without
significant
impairment.
the
commission
concluded
that
respondent's
evidence
which
rested
largely
on
the
so-called
severance
study
made
by
ebasco
services
inc.
did
not
demonstrate
that
there
would
be
such
a
loss
of
substantial
economies.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
surely.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
surely.
excuse
me.
the
first
circuit
reversed
not
upon
the
ground
that
the
commission's
decision
was
not
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence
but
rather
upon
the
ground
that
substantial
economies
means
merely
economies
which
“in
ordinary
business
parlance
and
by
ordinary
business
standards
are
of
substantial
nature.”
we
believe
that
this
question
of
interpretation
as
to
substantial
economies
is
the
only
question
before
this
court
for
two
principle
reasons.
first,
that
was
the
question
which
we
presented
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
respondents
agreed
that
that
was
the
question,
although,
they
endeavored
to
rephrase
it.
and
secondly,
because
the
court
below
did
not
accept
the
respondent's
argument,
its
primary
argument
to
that
court
that
the
commission's
decision
was
wrong.
that
it
misconstrued
the
evidence.
that
it
didn't
analyze
the
evidence
properly.
and
it
didn't
--
and
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
supported
by
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
choose
to
decide
on
that
ground.
it
did
not
find
that
the
commission's
findings
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
under
the
commission's
test
or
even
under
its
own
new
test
remanding
the
case
of
the
commission
for
determination
as
to
that
latter
feature.
consequently,
i
think
the
question
of
the
commission's
analysis
of
the
evidence
which
is
discussed
here
and
there
in
respondents
brief
is
at
pages
5,
7,
40
and
41
is
not
here.
in
considering
this
question,
some
discussion
of
the
statutory
background
and
provisions
maybe
helpful,
the
primary
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
is
the
correct
one.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
is
the
proper
stand.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
with
whether
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
whether
you'd
dis
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
--
agree
or
disagree
with
us.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
be
concerned
with
the
question
of
whether
the
commission's
decision
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes.
that
question
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
no,
i
don't
--
i
think
they
agree
that
the
question
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
they
say
it
is
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
they
questioned
that's
it
well-established,
that's
correct.
they
questioned
as
well-established
but
i
think
that
doesn't
change
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
commission's
test
or
the
first
circuit's
test
or
the
right
test
--
is
the
right
test,
is
the
matter
before
you.
that
is
simply
an
argument
that
the
commission's
test
is
not
well-established
and
therefore
carries
less
weight
than
it
otherwise
would.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes.
we
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
there's
certainly
a
dispute
between
the
respondent
and
ourselves
about
that.
there
certainly
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
i
don't
think
that
dispute
was
brought
up
to
this
court.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
either
remand
or
we
would
hope
you
could
see
your
way
clear
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
affirm
the
commission
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
suggest
that
the
commission's
findings
were
not
supported
upon
the
commission's
test.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no.
it
ruled
that
the
commission
applied
the
wrong
test.
and
therefore,
we
would
have
--
it
would
have
to
see
whether
or
not
applying
the
right
test
there
might
be
a
basis
for
a
contrary
finding
and
it
said
apply
its
own
test,
there
might
be.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that
may
well
be
your
honor.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
holding
company
act
was
to
reorganize
and
in
part
to
dismantle
the
far
flung
and
often
unsound
holding
company
empires
that
were
build
up
during
the
depression.
these
were
regarded
as
creating
undue
concentration
of
power,
unsound
financial
practices,
and
injury
to
investors
and
consumers
as
well
as
frustrating
impart
state
regulation
of
utilities.
the
act
was
the
most
--
one
of
the
most
significant
and
controversial
of
the
new
deal
reforms
and
i
think
it
might
startle
the
framers
of
the
act
a
little,
to
see
it
characterized
as
respondents
and
the
first
circuit
tend
to
do
as
a
simple
straightforward
businessman
statute.
it
is
perhaps
because
the
act
was
successful
as
it
was
in
accomplishing
its
purpose
that
there
is
so
little
controversy
about
it
today
and
that
it
is
possible
for
it
to
be
viewed
in
the
spirit
apparently
adopted
by
respondents
in
the
first
circuit.
the
act
sought
to
accomplish
its
primary
purpose
in
two
principal
ways.
the
commission
after
examining
each
holding
company
system
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
met
the
standards
of
section
11
and
after
provisioned
for
voluntary
adjustments
if
necessary
was
to
--
it
provided
in
11
(b)
(1)
required
divestiture
of
those
properties
and
subsidiaries
which
didn't
meet
the
statutory
standards.
and
that
that
is
the
section
--
subsection
here
involved
and
the
section
11
(b)
(2)
to
require
simplification
of
the
internal
structure
elimination
of
unnecessary
holding
companies,
financial
reorganizations
and
so
forth.
in
considering
the
controversies
and
the
compromises
that
--
and
the
legislative
history
which
respondents
now
and
again
refer,
it's
necessary
to
keep
the
distinction
between
11
(b)
(1)
and
11
(b)
(2)
in
line.
for
example,
if
they're
--
in
their
brief,
they
cite
or
remark
in
footnote
28
to
the
effect
that
a
beneficial
holding
company
such
as
theirs
might
continue
in
existence.
i
think
that
meant
that
it
would
not
be
required
to
be
dissolved
by
11
(b)
(2)
and
had
no
reference
to
retention
of
the
gas
systems.
in
11
(b)
(1),
initially
provides
that
the
utility
operations
of
a
holding
company
system
shall
be
“limited
to
a
single
integrated
public
utility
system.”
in
the
original
senate
version
of
the
legislation,
there
would
be
no
exceptions
to
this.
that
was
it.
while
the
house
version
gave
the
commission
discretionary
power
to
approve
exceptions,
the
house
objected
to
the
rigidity
of
the
senate
version
and
the
senate
objected
to
the
breadth
of
administrative
discretion
in
the
house
version.
and
in
conference,
a
compromise
was
adopted
which
entitles
the
holding
company
to
remain
--
to
retain
one
or
more
additional
integrated
systems.
if
the
commission
finds
a
lost
of
substantial
economies
as
mentioned
above
and
also
finds
that
the
additional
systems
satisfied
certain
requirements
as
to
size
and
location.
the
latter
re
--
well,
that
is,
they're
in
one
area
and
that
they're
not
too
big
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
these
latter
requirements
are
concededly
satisfied
in
the
present
case.
since
section
11
(b)
(2)
speaks
of
one
integrated
public
utility
system
or
additional
public
utility
systems
in
the
provisos,
it
is
initially
necessary
to
identify
what
that
is?
the
term
integrated
public
utility
system
is
defined
in
section
2
(a)
(29)
of
the
act
separately
for
gas
systems
and
for
electric
system.
as
to
the
two
definitions
are
--
rather
similar
in
their
basic
characteristics
speaking
in
terms
of
coordinated
systems
located
in
the
single
area
in
the
region
and
not
unduly
large
and
capable
of
being
operated
economically
or
with
substantial
economies
together.
the
definition
of
an
integrated
gas
utility
system
provides
that
the
companies
must
be
so
located
and
related
that
substantial
economies
maybe
effectuated
by
being
operated
as
a
single
system.
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
substantial
economies
in
section
11
(b)
(1),
we
believe
that
the
commission's
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
pattern
and
purpose
of
the
act
established
precedent
and
legislative
history
to
the
extent
there
is
relevant
history,
and
that
in
any
event,
the
first
circuit's
interpretation
lacks
that
support.
as
respondents
and
courts
in
earlier
cases
have
pointed
out
substantial
is
a
“relative
in
the
elastic
term.”
in
applying
it
to
a
given
situation,
the
first
inquiry
is
substantial
in
relation
to
what?
the
sum
of
money
which
would
be
substantial
in
our
budget
would
hardly
be
substantial
to
the
department
of
defense.
in
the
commission's
view
substantial
is
used
in
section
11
(b)
(1),
mean
substantial
in
relation
to
the
issue
to
be
decided.
that
is,
whether
the
additional
system
should
remain
under
the
holding
company
or
be
operated
independently.
and
accordingly,
inquiry
is
focused
on
the
substantiality
of
the
economic
impact
favorable
and
unfavorable
which
independent
operation
would
have
on
the
system.
exactly,
what
the
first
circuit's
test
of
business
judgment
as
to
the
substantiality
of
an
increase
in
expenses
relates
to
if
not
very
clear?
we
believe
that
the
statutory
purposes
and
pattern
also
point
to
the
conclusion
that
the
economies
have
to
be
really
substantial
to
permit
the
retention
of
an
additional
system
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it
appears
to
be
the
general
policy
of
the
act
to
encourage
holding
companies
to
arrange
their
operations
so
as
to
have
a
single
integrated
public
utility
system
and
then
to
confine
them
to
that.
the
provisos,
at
the
end
of
section
11
(b)
(1),
should
not
be
so
expanded
as
to
devour
that
fundamental
principle.
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
put
it
in
the
engineers
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
quoted
in
the
commission's
opinion,
the
congress
was
first
concerned
with
wiping
out
of
the
evils
which
the
practice
of
utility
combinations
had
produced
and
“congress
only
consented
to
dull
the
blade
of
it's
chosen
weapon
improved
to
hard
cases.”
not
only
is
this
interpretation
consistent
with
what
the
act
says
but
is
fully
supported
by
the
legislative
history
recited
in
our
brief.
i
won't
recite
it
all
again
here
except
to
--
that
differ
with
the
respondent
suggestion
that
senator
wheeler's
remarks,
a
few
minutes
after
the
bill,
the
conference
report
was
adopted
are
not
properly
applied
to
the
legislative
history
and
that
he
was
an
opponent
of
the
provision.
senator
wheeler
was
the
chairman
of
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
committee
which
considered
the
bill.
he
was
the
author
of
the
bill.
he
was
the
floor
manager
of
the
bill
in
the
senate.
he
was
a
member
of
the
conference
committee
and
presented
the
conference
report
for
adoption.
i
think
that
he's
version
of
what
he
thought
he
was
doing
has
considerable
weight.
in
reference
to
senator
norris'
saying
in
debate,
that
senator
wheeler
was
not
really
in
favor
of
what
had
been
done
that
he
wasn't
satisfied
with
it
relates
i
believe
to
the
compromise
made
at
the
same
time
as
to
11
(b)
(2),
the
elimination
provision
and
specifically
as
appears
from
senator
norris's
speech
to
the
inter-elimination
of
intermediate
holding
companies
which
senator
wheeler
had
wished
to
see
happen
to
a
greater
extent
and
ultimately
did.
contrary
so
--
contrary
to
respondent's
assertions,
we
also
believe
that
there
has
been
a
test
in
--
which
in
essence
has
been
continuously
utilized
ever
since
1942
when
the
meaning
of
clause
a
first
came
before
the
commission.
that
was
the
north
american
company
case
cited
in
everybody's
brief.
there
have
of
course
been
some
variations
in
the
words
used
to
express
this
interpretation
depending
upon
the
context
in
the
issues
in
particular
cases.
and
there
probably
has
been
some
refinement
of
the
doctrine
particularly
between
the
north
american
case
which
used
rather
general
language
and
the
engineers
case
of
the
commission
which
came
only
five
months
later,
still
in
1942,
and
which
rather
clearly
adopted
the
present
test.
in
viewing
the
history
of
the
interpretation
of
clause
a
of
section
11
(b)
(1),
a
few
points
stand
out,
neither
the
commission
nor
in
our
view
any
courts
until
the
present
case
has
ever
held
that
a
case
for
retention
is
made
out
simply
by
showing
a
substantial
increase
in
expenses.
the
commission
has
rejected
this
construction
from
the
beginning
as
has
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
engineers
and
the
philadelphia
cases.
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
commission
has
insisted
that
all
aspects
of
the
situation
be
canvassed
and
explored
and
that
saving
--
the
savings
and
expenses
attributable
to
combined
operation
be
measured
against
the
advantages
measurable
and
immeasurable
of
independent
operation
including
the
freeing
of
potential
competitors
from
common
control.
not
even
the
fifth
circuit
which
reversed
the
commission
in
the
louisiana
public
service
case
and
was
in
turn
reversed
by
this
court
on
jurisdictional
grounds
in
our
view
went
so
far.
that
court
we
believed
held
essentially
that
substantiality
must
be
judged
in
relation
to
the
ability
of
the
independent
system
to
an
effect
do
business
as
usual
to
operate
without
a
substantial
change.
and
as
i
say
that
decision
did
not
have
any
consequences
in
the
law
that
followed
because
of
this
court's
jurisdictional
holding.
the
commission
on
the
other
hand
has
never
held
as
respondents
in
the
first
circuit
seemed
to
suggest
that
in
considering
the
substantiality
of
economies,
you
consider
only
the
ability
of
the
additional
system
operating
independently
to
survive.
in
practice
as
in
this
case,
the
commission
considers
the
amount
of
the
savings
and
weighs
the
economic
advantages
of
retention
against
the
benefits
tangible
and
intangible
of
independent
operation
including
the
desirability
of
single-minded
management
and
the
promotion
of
competition.
this
incidentally
is
somewhat
what
the
respondent's
urged
the
commission
to
do
in
the
present
case
when
the
case
was
before
the
commission.
but
the
commission's
judgment
came
out
the
opposite
way
from
theirs
on
the
facts.
and
here,
in
reaching
such
a
judgment,
the
commission
is
of
course
influenced
by
what
--
might
re
(inaudible)
--
be
regarded
as
a
statutory
presumption
against
having
multiple
systems
in
the
same
holding
company
and
particularly
in
cases
involving
combinations
of
gas
and
electricity,
the
advantages
of
freeing
a
potential
competitor.
and
i
think
it
is
only
in
this
last
area
that
we
and
respondents
were
initially
might
--
far
apart
on
the
law,
i
mean,
as
a
--
we
were
far
apart
on
the
facts
in
the
beginning.
we
still
are
but
we
have
grown
further
apart
on
the
law.
it
seems
to
me
clear
therefore,
that
the
commission's
view
of
clause
a
of
section
11
(b)
is
a
reasonable
one.
consistent
with
the
statutory
purpose
and
that
it
has
been
consistently
held
and
supported
by
at
least
the
weight
of
judicial
authority
and
conver
--
conversely
that
the
first
circuit
substitute
test
which
was
not
even
advanced
in
respondent's
briefs
to
that
court
but
was
evolved
on
the
court's
own
motion
lack
such
support.
i
might
stop
here,
except
that
the
respondent
in
the
first
circuit
have
advanced
certain
additional
objections
to
the
commission's
decision
including
the
so-called
symmetry
between
clause
a
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
and
clause
d
of
section
2
(a)
(29)
defining
the
section
which
both
refers
substantial
economies
and
the
alleged
lack
of
any
policy
in
the
act
against
combined
gas
and
electric
systems
or
alternatively,
the
contention
that
formulation
of
policy
in
that
area
was
in
effect
delegated
to
the
states.
i
believed
that
these
objections
spring
from
certain
inherent
difficulties
in
the
application
of
the
definitions
in
section
2
(a)
(29)
and
the
provisions
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
to
a
situation
such
as
this.
involving
a
holding
company
owning
both
a
group
of
gas
companies
which
appeared
to
constitute
a
single
integrated
gas
system
together
with
a
single
integrated
electric
system
located
in
the
same
area
and
that
the
commission
resolved
these
difficulties
in
a
reasonable
way.
in
such
a
situation,
there
will
normally
be
operational
economies
in
such
matters
as
customer
accounting,
combined
billing,
etcetera
which
result
from
operating
the
gas
companies
together
rather
than
from
operating
them
separately,
and
assuming
that
the
size
and
location
standards
of
2
(a)
(29)
(b)
are
met
there
is
no
reason
not
to
find
the
gas
companies
to
be
a
single
integrated
system.
there
is
no
policy
objection
to
--
say,
putting
together
an
integrated
system.
the
fact
if
you
can
find
there
is
one,
that's
what
the
statute
wants
you
to
have.
since
this
appeared
clearly
to
be
the
case
here
and
the
respondents
and
the
commission
staff
were
in
agreement
about
it
by
the
time
the
case
reached
the
commission
for
decision
the
commission,
as
it
is
done
in
a
number
of
the
prior
cases,
simply
found
the
gas
companies
to
be
a
single
integrated
system
without
making
subsidiary
findings.
we
see
no
particular
objections
to
this
but
respondents
make
considerable
--
of
a
point
of
it
and
they
cite
the
city
service
case
14
s.e.c.,
where
the
commission
declined
to
accept
a
concession
by
its
staff
and
where
they
had
in
--
found
independently.
that
however,
was
not
a
2
(a)
(29)
case.
that
was
an
11
(b)
(1)
case
and
the
commission's
action
there
illustrates
the
fact
that
there
is
a
sort
of
a
presumption
against
finding
retention
under
section
11
(b)
(1).
and
the
commission
does
not
do
so
without
weighing
the
arguments
for
independents
and
for
combined
operation
which
kind
of
arguments
just
don't
arise
in
the
case
of
identifying
a
single
independent
--
a
single
integrated
system
under
the
definitions.
for
--
proceeding
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
there
will
probably
be
even
further
operating
economies
of
the
same
general
nature,
billing,
meter
reading,
and
so
forth
which
accrue
from
combining
the
gas
companies
and
the
electric
companies.
it
is,
however,
impossible
to
treat
the
gas
and
electric
together
as
a
single
integrated
public
utility
system
because,
although,
earlier
drafts
of
the
statute
would
probably
have
permitted
this.
congress
ultimately
wrote
the
definition
of
an
integrated
public
utility
system
in
2
(a)
(29)
in
a
manner
which
precludes
such
treatment.
as
the
court
of
appeals
explained
in
the
philadelphia
company
case,
there
is
one
definition
of
an
integrated
gas
system
in
the
second
definition
of
an
integrated
electric
system
and
there
is
no
third
definition
of
a
combined
system
nor
is
the
commission
permitted
by
the
act
to
formulate
one.
confronted
with
this
situation,
the
first
circuit
and
respondents
reasoned
that
in
this
type
of
case,
the
commission
must
permit
retention
of
a
gas
system
under
section
11
(b)
(1)
because
if
economies
amounting
to
x
and
attributable
to
combining
the
gas
companies
are
substantial
economies
as
that
term
is
used
in
section
2
(a)
(29)
(b)
then
economies
of
x
plus
y
resulting
from
the
further
combination
of
gas
and
electric
are
a
fortiori
substantial
economies
for
purposes
of
clause
a
of
section
11
(b)
(1).
while
this
at
first
blush
seems
logical,
it
nullifies
the
congressional
decision
expressed
in
the
dual
definition
in
section
2
(a)
(29).
it
makes
that
meaningless
in
this
type
of
case
because
you
still
always
keep
the
gas
and
electric
together.
and
it
also
nullifies
the
apparent
purposes
of
that
distinction.
the
pertinent
policy
is
expressed
in
an
excerpt
from
senate
report
621
discussed
in
our
brief
at
pages
35
through
37
dealing
with
section
8
of
the
act.
section
8
in
the
original
draft
would
have
prohibited
holding
companies
from
acquiring
or
retaining
combined
gas
and
electric
systems
in
states
where
combination
of
gas
and
electric
operating
companies
were
contrary
to
this
local
policy.
the
committee
deleted
the
prohibition
against
retention
which
is
a
combination
systems
would
carefully
explained
that
this
was
a
change
in
the
procedure
and
not
in
policy.
it
said
that
section
8
was
designed
to
prevent
the
use
of
a
holding
company
in
the
future
to
deprive
the
public
of
the
benefits
of
competition
between
gas
and
electric
energy
and
went
on
to
say,
this
is
where
i
quote,
“the
committee
felt
that
while
the
policy
upon
which
this
section
was
based
was
essential
in
the
formulation
of
any
federal
legislation
on
utility
holding
company
act
companies
it
did
not
think
that
the
section
should
make
it
unlawful
to
retain",
and
i
emphasize,
"up
to
the
time
that
section
11
may
require
divestment
interest
lawfully
acquire.”
the
commission
has
considered
since
it's
first
case
involving
clause
a,
the
north
american
case,
referred
to
in
the
briefs
that
a
similar
policy
underlay
the
congressional
decision
to
refer
decision
as
to
combi
--
combinations
of
gas
and
electric
properties
to
proceedings
under
section
11
(b)
(1)
as
just
as
it
left
the
question
of
retention
which
was
dealt
with
in
the
original
section
8
to
proceedings
under
section
11
(b)
(1).
thus,
in
the
original
north
american
proceeding,
the
issue
arose
in
the
context
of
a
gas
company
and
an
electric
company
both
in
the
saint
louis
area
and
both
in
the
north
american
system.
the
commission,
in
its
decision
11
s.e.c.of
317,
referred
to
the
alleged
operational
savings
from
retention
which
were
the
same
general
nature
as
those
alleged
here
concluded
that
the
record
was
inadequate
to
permit
comparison
of
those
economies
with
the
possible
benefits
of
independent
operation
including
the
promotion
of
competition
and
sent
the
case
back
for
further
hearings.
after
these
hearings
and
in
the
decision
reported
in
18
s.e.c.
611,
the
commission
first
ascertained
the
amount
of
the
savings
and
expenses
which
would
result
from
severance
and
then
said,
“to
accept
these
estimates
without
further
inquiry
would
be
to
distort
the
act.”
the
provisions
of
section
11
(b)
(1)
under
which
additional
utility
systems
maybe
retained
are
exceptions,
the
basic
policy
that
holding
companies
be
limited
to
the
control
of
the
single
system.
the
benefits
of
terminating
widespread
control
subtle
and
apparent
must
be
considered
as
offsets
to
the
claims
of
lost
economies.
only
the
balance
or
it
maybe
inexpressible
in
money
terms
conform
the
basis
of
decision.
the
instant
case
points
out
the
necessity
for
that
rule.
we
are
asked
to
permit
electric
and
gas
utility
companies
serving
the
same
territory
to
be
held
together.
the
businesses
in
many
aspects
of
their
operation
are
competitors.
it
is
the
inevitable
tendency
of
the
joint
control
to
favor
that
business
which
is
mo
--
in
which
it
is
most
interested
and
which
is
most
profitable.
the
commission
then
went
on
to
consider
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
competitive
advantages
of
independent
operations
and
ordered
severance.
we
believed
that
this
analysis
answers
a
number
of
problems
raised
by
respondent
in
the
first
circuit
including
the
a
fortiori
or
symmetry
argument
about
substantial
economies
meaning
the
same
thing
in
both
places
which
would
largely
foreclose
the
complete
examination
made
in
the
usual
section
11
(b)
(1)
case.
the
point
is
not
so
much
that
the
word
substantial
economies
mean
different
things
in
the
two
sections
as
it
is
that
the
nature
of
the
issues
and
inquiries
and
the
determination
under
section
11
(b)
is
ordinarily
rather
different
from
that
involved
in
a
2
(a)
(29)
case,
the
latter
being
preliminary
to
the
former.
in
the
cases
where
they
sought
to
retain
an
additional
electric
system
along
with
the
principle
electric
system
--
or
an
additional
gas
system,
along
with
the
principle
gas
system,
the
policies
against
systems
which
were
too
large
or
too
scattered
expressed
in
2
(a)
(29)
carryover
to
some
degree
into
section
11
(b)
which
is
the
explanation
or
the
statement
in
the
prior
commission
brief
that
there
is
some
overlap.
but
the
issues
with
respect
to
economies
would
be
quite
different.
if
the
additional
system
was
capable
of
coordinated
and
integrated
operation
with
the
principle
system,
the
question
probably
would
never
be
reached
under
11
(b).
if
the
systems
are
not
capable
of
coord
--
coordinated
operation,
they're
presumably
would
be
few
if
any
operational
savings
from
combining
them.
the
economies
would
relate
to
such
matters
as
the
common
services
provided
by
the
holding
company.
and
that's
the
case
when
you
look
at
these
electric
and
electric
or
gas
and
gas
cases
under
11
(b)
(1)
the
usual
savings
relate
to
the
service
of
the
holding
company.
the
commission
weighs
these
against
the
disadvantages
of
absentee
ownership
and
widespread
control
and
reaches
a
judgment
which
is
quite
different
and
more
difficult
than
the
judgment
under
2
(a)
(29)
with
respect
to
the
economies
of
combining
a
group
of
coordinated
companies.
where
the
question
involves
combining
gas
companies
and
electric
companies
as
here
while
--
where
true
operating
economies
may
result.
this
is
we
have
seen
characterized
by
definition
in
the
2
(a)
(29)
determination
that
there
is
a
single
integrated
system
and
is
referred
to
10
(b)
--
11
(b)
where
there
must
be
a
weighing
against
the
saving
and
expenses
of
the
advantages
both
the
utility
and
for
the
public
of
freeing
a
potential
competitor
in
giving
it
a
single-minded
management
solely
devoted
to
it's
welfare.
this
type
of
determination
is
almost
never
called
for
in
a
2
(a)
(29)
proceeding
involving
only
gas
companies
or
only
electric
companies
since
gas
utilities
rarely
if
ever
compete
with
other
gas
utilities,
the
same
is
true
electric
systems.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
not
to
any
great
degree.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that
--
there
are
two
types
of
determinations
which
are
made
when
you
just
have
electricity
or
you
just
have
gas.
there
is
first
the
2
(a)
(29)
determination
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
the
gas
and
electric
systems
together.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
there
was
some
evidence
introduced
to
the
effect
that
because
of
the
increase
in
expenses
the
rates
might
have
to
go
up.
the
commission
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no,
just
in
the
gas
system.
the
commission
concluded
that
this
was,
i
believe,
i
said,
remote
and
speculative
and
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
there
might
be
advantages,
offsetting
advantages
derived
from
having
the
gas
companies
freely
operate
it.
they
might
become
more
competitive.
they
might
have
a
more
effective
promotion
of
their
interests
and
consequently,
we
can't
reduce
the
precise
figures
to
dollars.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
--
i
think
it
could
well
be
relevant
on
the
merits,
that
is,
if
it
turned
out
that
the
loss
of
economies
was
so
substantial
that
the
rates
would
have
to
go
up?
if
the
system
was
separated
that
might
well
be
a
good
reason
not
to
separate
it.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
if
that
depends
on
whether
a
million
dollars,
it
is
substantial
in
the
particular
context
you
have
whether
they'd
go
up
one
half
or
1%
or
10%.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
the
commission
considered
this
matter,
included
in
effect
that
it
was
unable
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
rates
would
go
up,
they
might
or
they
might
not.
but
as
i've
say
--
attempted
to
say
earlier
whether
the
commission's
treatment
of
rates
was
or
was
not
the
best
treatment.
if
not
i
think
here,
you're
--
you
merely
--
considering
the
proper
test
to
be
applied.
now,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
if
it
was
clear
from
the
evidence
that
the
rates
would
have
to
go
up
that
would
be
a
very
strong
reason
for
retention
under
the
commission's
test
or
any
other
test.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
would
feel
if
the
operation
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
sound
and
economical
operation.
if
they
had
to
raise
their
rates,
the
operation
would
not
be
a
sound
or
as
economical
as
it
had
been
before.
and
if
that
--
that
is
this
part
of
the
question
under
our
test.
another
question
is
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
policy
in
the
act
with
respect
to
combined
gas
and
electric
systems.
as
the
commission
pointed
out
in
it's
opinion
in
this
case,
there
is
no
overall
general
policy
applicable
in
all
circumstances
against
such
a
combination
and
the
commission
has
permitted
the
continued
existence
of
combined
systems
for
granting
exemptions
from
the
act,
the
wholly
intrastate
holding
companies
or
the
holding
companies
which
are
primarily
operating
companies,
and
in
allowing
companies
to
come
out
from
under
it's
jurisdiction
when
they
ceased
to
be
part
of
a
holding
company
system.
the
reference
in
the
commission's
opinion
to
this
statement
was
in
answer
to
an
argument
that
if
you
allow
combined
companies
to
exist
in
this
context,
why
not
to
encourage
them
in
an
11
(b)
(1)
proceeding.
but
as
we
have
seen
there
is
such
a
policy
when
the
question
arises
in
proceedings
under
section
11
(b)
(1)
because
under
section
11
(b)
(1),
the
commission
has
consistently
held
that
the
merits
of
competition
both
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
company
itself
as
--
in
its
more
vigorous
operation
and
the
public
merit
advantages
are
to
be
considered.
the
first
circuit
sort
of
suggested
that
maybe
you
could
look
at
them
but
said
you
had
to
reduce
the
amount
of
--
determined
the
amount
of
money
which
would
be
saved
by
competition
and
in
effect
subtract
it
from
the
expenses.
this
is
just
an
impossible
process
because
you're
dealing
with
the
public
and
intangible
advantages
which
will
occur
from
more
vigorous
competition
in
the
future.
it's
like
in
an
antitrust
case
involving
a
merger
to
say
that
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
antitrust
division
would
have
to
prove
how
many
dollars
competitors
would
lose
as
a
result
of
the
merger
and
subtract
that
from
the
savings
to
the
merged
companies
and
come
up
with
the
dollar
fee.
you
just
can't
analyze
future
competition
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
--
that
way.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes.
there
have
been
several
such
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
these
were
small
systems
where
it
was
felt
that
the
type
of
consideration
that
mr.
justice
white
is
referring
to
outweighed
the
advantages
of
independent
operation.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i
think
so.
as
to
the
question
of
delegation
of
policy
making
to
the
states,
the
act
defers
to
state
policy
in
a
number
of
cases
but
it
does
not
so
defer
in
section
11.
in
the
first
place,
while
section
8
gives
the
states
a
veto
over
the
formation
of
gas
and
electric
systems
within
their
jurisdiction
without
any
findings
with
respect
to
substantial
economies
or
anything
else
the
state
policy
is
not
altogether
binding
on
the
commission.
under
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
the
commission
cannot
approve
an
acquisition
which
would
violate
section
8
or
it
concludes
that
the
acquisition
would
be
detrimental
to
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
section
11.
thus,
even
if
the
state
does
not
exercise
it's
veto
and
entirely
proves
the
combination
the
commission
may
nevertheless
disapprove
the
acquisition
if
it
finds
it
detrimental
to
the
provisions
of
carrying
--
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
section
11
which
is
precisely
the
type
of
determination
which
was
made
here.
section
11
expresses
the
major
policy
decision
of
the
act.
it
is
a
federal
policy
and
where
necessary
it
overrides
state
policy.
this
is
illustrated
by
section
10
(f).
section
10
together
with
section
9
in
general
make
it
unlawful
for
holding
companies
to
acquire
utility
assets
and
other
interests
unless
the
commission
finds
the
acquisition
is
consistent
both
with
the
requirements
and
policies
of
the
federal
act
and
with
applicable
state
requirements
and
policies.
section
10
(f)
however
provides
that
the
commission
may
approve
an
acquisition
even
if
contrary
to
state
law
if
it
finds
that
“compliance
with
such
state
law
could
be
detrimental
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
provisions
of
section
11.”
in
other
words
section
11
policies
and
this
is
a
section
11
case
are
not
delegated
to
or
subject
to
the
control
of
state
law.
we
believe
therefore
that
not
only
does
the
commission's
interpretation
conform
to
the
statutory
purposes
and
policies
but
that
most
of
the
specific
objections
to
it
advanced
by
respondents
tend
to
diminish
on
analysis.
as
i
have
said
there
are
probabilities
in
applying
these
sections
to
a
factual
situation
like
the
present
one
but
we
believe
that
the
commission's
approach
to
resolving
this
problems
as
it
has
evolved
from
experience
over
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
conforms
to
the
congressional
intent.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
mr.
quarles
actually
describes
the
way
in
which
he
thinks
these
things
should
be
approached
in
a
manner
that
is
not
too
different
as
he
agrees
with
the
way
we
described
it.
he
suggests
that
the
commission
should
consider
as
it
has
done
offsetting
items
in
the
total
picture
as
well
as
merely
savings
and
expenses.
and
that
the
economies
involved
must
be
serious
and
important
in
order
to
justify
retention.
the
real
economic
need
justify
the
committee.
the
commission,
he
points
out
that
the
commission
in
fact
does
this.
the
ratios
are
computed
and
that
an
effort
is
made
to
measure
the
significance
of
the
losses
of
economy
in
the
total
operation
of
the
enterprise.
and
mr.
quarles
does
not
--
he
says
hardly
a
word
in
defense
of
the
alternative
test
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
don't
find
any
mention
of
that
test
which
seems
to
be
expressed
solely
in
terms
of
is
there
a
loss
of
expenses
with
someone
would
regard
as
significant
as
a
business
matter
comports
it
all
or
permits
it
all
the
type
of
analysis
which
mr.
quarles
says
should
be
pursued.
in
addition,
our
test
is
not
as
he
suggests
that
simply
that
--
it
is
impossible
to
operate
the
system
independently.
it
is
expressed
in
terms
in
the
petition
in
this
case
or
that
it
cannot
be
--
that
it
cannot
be
operated
soundly
and
economically
on
an
independent
basis
which
is
quite
a
different
thing.
sound,
economic,
desirable,
useful,
socially
useful
operation,
yet
independently
is
i
think
one
of
the
objectives
that
was
sought
to
be
achieved
by
section
11.
it's
not
a
matter
of
necessity
or
bankruptcy
or
anything
like
that.
i
want
to
avoid
any
indication
that
it
was.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i
believe
it
is.
it
sound
--
i
think
the
wording
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
knowing
that
in
various
cases
and
in
the
opinion
in
this
case,
there
were
various
formulations
but
they
all
seem
to
come
down
to
two
main
thrust
that
the
--
that
in
order
to
permit
retention
the
system
cannot
be
operated
soundly
in
--
on
an
independent
basis
soundly
and
economically
or
it
cannot
be
operated
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
--
on
an
independent
basis
without
serious
impairment
which
i
think
means
much
the
same
thing.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
it
that
--
if
that
is
the
case
--
if
it
--
cannot
be
operated
independently
then
it
is
retained
by
the
holding
companies
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
it
cannot
be
operated
--
i
don't
say
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes,
i'm
get
--
i'm
backing
away
from
this
extent
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
don't
simply
say,
it
cannot
be
operated
independently,
period.
we
say
it
cannot
be
operated
independently
on
a
sound
and
economical
phases
as
a
(voice

--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
--
court
(voice
overlap)
since
been
applied.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
companies
that
are
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
companies
that
are
unsound
and
uneconomic
probably
don't
but
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we're
talking
about
a
company
which
is
sound
economic.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
separated
unless
it
is
sound
and
economic
to
operate
it
independently.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
it's
a
similar
version
of
the
same
thing,
economical
and
efficient,
sound
and
economic,
they're
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
i
think
they
are
very
much
the
same,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i
am
never
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
the
test
that
they
--
they
put
it
finally
in
this
way,
they
hol
--
we
hold
that
the
clause
must
be
strictly
construed
that
a
registrant
seeking
to
retain
an
additional
system
as
the
burden
of
showing
that
is
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
such
additional
system
cannot
be
operated
under
separate
ownership
without
the
loss
of
economies
so
important
as
to
cause
a
serious
impairment,
which
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
--
it's
the
serious
--
the
same
serious
impairment
test
that
was
announced
in
the
engineer's
case
in
1942
by
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
either
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i
--
at
other
times,
the
commission
and
in
its
opinion
is
had
did.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
it.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
it
--
on
the
record,
it's
on
page
1262
and
1263.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
that
is
volume
2
of
the
record.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
12.
and
there's
a
further
discussion
of
the
test
on
1261.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
i
think
this
is
perfectly
satisfactory
test,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
the
one
that
on
(inaudible)
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes,
the
one
in
the
commission's
opinion,
1260
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
the
one
of
1262
or
1263
was
the
one
that
i
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
it's
--
it
carries
over
on
bottom
of
one
page
to
the
top
of
the
next.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
no,
that
--
yes,
that
is
in
this
case.
that's
the
commission's
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
it's
almost
identical.
they
--
he
were
--
used
the
words
serious
impairment.
i
don't
think
the
words
economies
so
important
is
the
cause
of
a
serious
impairment
used
in
engineer's,
engineer
had
simply
said
loss
of
the
economy
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
what
is
it?
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
it
was
the
same
i
believe
mr.
justice
douglas.
they
referred
to
serious
impairment
of
the
system
in
engineer's
as
well
in
1942,
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
i
should
think
--
it
might
be
unless
the
offsetting
advantages
of
competition
made
it
unlikely
that
the
impairment
would
be
that
serious.
now
--
finally
in
regard
to
the
construction
of
the
act
and
the
words
that
the
argument
that
mr.
quarles
announced
with
reference
to
the
words.
this
court
in
the
joiner
case
which
is
also
involving
one
of
our
statutes
stated
that
it
would
construe
the
details
of
an
act
in
conformity
with
it's
dominating
general
purpose
will
read
the
text
in
the
light
of
context
and
we'll
interpret
the
text
insofar
as
the
meaning
of
the
words
fairly
permits
so
as
to
carry
out
in
particular
cases
the
generally
expressed
legislative
policy.
i
think
that
the
same
should
be
done
here.
i
think
that
--
further
the
--
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out
the
context
in
11
(b)
(1),
in
which
the
word
substantial
economies
is
used
is
somewhat
different
than
it
is
in
2
(a)
(29)
and
that
in
turn
--
because
the
11
(b)
(1)
refers
to
a
situation
where
the
systems
cannot
--
again
that
word
is
used
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
which
can
be
secured
by
the
retention
of
control
which
the
latter
phrase,
i
think
means,
primarily
that
retention
isn't
justified
if
the
economies
would
not
be
retained
even
if
not
be
secured,
even
if
the
holding
company
control
was
retained.
so
the
fundamental
test
is
it
cannot
be
operated
as
an
independent
system
without
the
loss
of
substantial
economies.
finally,
i
wanted
to
correct
one
possible
misinterpretation.
i
was
asked
if
the
commission
has
ever
permitted
the
retention
of
gas
and
electric
properties
together.
it
has
its
several
types
of
situations
but
i
was
unable
to
discover
during
the
recess
a
situation
where
it
had
done
so
in
section
11
(b)
case
and
there
may
not
be
yet.
thank
you.
