justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
messerman,
you
say
that
trial
counsel
was
assigned
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
page
22,
he
seems
to
know
what
this
is
all
about.
“prima
facie
your
honor
is
all
we're
interested
in.”
now,
what's
the
significance
of
that,
notwithstanding
the
petitioner's
objections?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
then
suggesting
that
whatever
assigned
counsel
did,
he
did
nothing
which
could
be
imputed
to
the
petitioner
as
a
waiver,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
look
what
follows,
“make
up
your
mind
whether
you
require
a
prima
facie
case
or
a
complete
trial.”
and
then
this
counsel
intervenes,
“prima
facie
your
honor,
it's
all
we're
interested
in.”
the
court
says,
“alright,”
and
it
goes
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
raise
the
constitutional
issue
for
us,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
do
have
a
problem
i
gather
if
in
the
area
at
least
of
henry
and
mississippi,
and
fay
and
noia
on
this,
don't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
did
recall
--
we
did
hold
in
henry,
as
i
remember,
that
there
are
some
things
that
counsel
does,
perhaps
there
are
many
things
that
counsel
does,
that
are
binding
upon
his
client
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
file
of
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
recall
am
i
right,
didn't
henry
decide
a
fifth
circuit
decision
that
the
election
of
counsel
not
to
challenge
the
racial
composition
of
a
jury
in
the
circumstances
of
the
state
in
which
the
case
was
being
tried
was
something
not
binding
upon
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
this
comes
within
that
sort
of
situation
rather
than
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
those
material
amendments,
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
all
that
--
all
of
those
amendments
were
objected
to,
weren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
james
cox
and
james
brookhart
different
people?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
james
brookhart
was
somebody
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
it
--
what
the
judge
did
was
to
delete
cox's
name
and
sets
to
brookhart.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
something
about
this
prima
facie
practice?
is
that
--
is
this
just
something
that
is
followed
in
some
of
ohio
counties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
the
conviction
under
this
procedure
have
any
different
effect
in
the
civil
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
the
conviction
be
admissible
in
the
civil
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apparently
it
developed
that
he
had
not
afford
to
win
jimmy
cox's,
that
he
had,
i
gather,
forged
somebody
else's
but
then
in
the
middle
of
trial
and
the
charge
never
made.
you
amend
the
indictment,
that's
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
the
judge
of
35,
at
one
point,
at
least,
seem
to
indicate
was
situation
for
re-indictment,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
normally
the
way
this
is
done?
if
the
indictment
is
that
effective,
would
it
not
call
for
re-indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
that
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
ohio
practice
of
it?
where
it's
--
goes
to
the
substance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
prior
re-indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
from
what
you
say
mr.
attorney
general,
you
don't
think
this
was
a
model
of
a
criminal
trial,
do
you?
