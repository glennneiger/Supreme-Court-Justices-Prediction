mr.
leo
j.
conway
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
there's
no
more
frustrating
a
problem
that
confronts
a
lawyer
than
being
called
upon
to
defend
a
client
who
has
no
defense.
a
client
who
is
one
of
three
codefendants,
two
of
whom
already
have
pleaded
guilty
and
who
--
although
he
is
unable
to
assist
his
attorney
in
presenting
any
kind
of
a
defense
refuses
to
acknowledge
his
guilt.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
am
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean
this.
that
this
man
was
brought
--
he
was
in
jail
and
he
had
an
attorney
appointed
to
defendant.
the
attorney
went
to
the
jail.
he
asked
the
man
to
indicate
to
him
how
he
was
to
defend
the
case,
“who
are
your
witnesses?
what
defense
do
you
have?”
and,
the
man
says,
“i
have
no
defense
that
i
know
of
because
at
the
time
that
these
things
were
--
occurred
i
was
a
victim
of
alcoholic
amnesia.
i
don't
remember
a
thing
about
it.
i
do
feel
that
because
i
do
not
remember
what
happened
at
this
time
that
i
refuse
to
plead
guilty.”
but
that
was
the
situation
that
this
attorney
found
himself
in
when
he
was
required
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
to
present
some
sort
of
a
defense
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
he
had
found
that
because
of
the
drinking
that
had
gone
on
after
he
had
been
incarcerated
in
a
federal
penitentiary
because
of
--
as
a
result
of
another
crime
that
was
committed,
the
federal
authority
saw
it
fit
to
send
him
to
the
springfield
hospital
in
the
hopes
that
they
may
--
might
cure
him
in
this
mental
or
this
alcoholic
problem
that
he
had.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
he
had
apparently
your
honor
indicated
two
penitentiary
people
that
he
had
this
alcoholic
habit
which
he
hoped
to
overcome
and
that
was
the
basis
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that,
you
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
no,
i
--
if
i'd
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
he
claimed
that
at
the
time
that
the
offenses
were
committed,
prior
to
the
time
that
he
went
to
the
federal
penitentiary
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
that
he
was
intoxicated
to
the
point
where
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing.
after
these
crimes
were
committed,
he
and
the
two
codefendants
went
to
new
york
and
finally
he
and
one
of
them
ended
up
in
florida.
and
in
florida
he
was
then
picked
up
for
stealing
the
automobile
that
they
had
gone
to
florida
then
and
was
tried
under
the
dyer
act
and
that's
how
he
happened
to
be
in
the
federal
penitentiary.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
think
that
for
the
most
part
it
is,
your
honor.
it's
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
this
particular
incident
is
in
the
record,
but
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
federal
penitentiary
as
a
result
of
the
incarceration
as
a
result
of
the
dyer
act
conviction
is
in
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
believe
that
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
that
in
my
brief,
it
is
mentioned.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
in
my
brief
it
is
mentioned.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
made
no
effort
to
rely
upon
this.
i
gave
you
that
answer
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
in
reference
to
a
question
that
you
asked
me.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that
is
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that
part
is
in
the
record.
it's
in
page
55
of
the
record
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
in
which
his
counsel
brings
this
fact
out
to
the
court
in
litigation.
i'm
sorry
if
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
i
didn't
understand
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that
was
at
the
trial.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that
was
at
the
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
55
of
the
record.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
yes,
sir.
when
the
--
may
i
proceed,
your
honor?
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
the
petitioner
refused
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
he
apparently
did
agree
with
his
counsel
that
he
should
waive
a
trial
by
a
jury
because
he
signed
a
waiver
of
trial
by
jury
in
writing
and
then
at
the
outset
of
the
proceedings
of
colloquy
as
mr.
messerman
indicated,
was
held
by
the
court.
and
for
the
first
time
the
question
of
a
prima
facie
case
was
brought
out
by
defense
counsel
himself
who
said,
“may
it
please
your
honor,
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
prima
facie
case.”
that's
at
page
22
of
the
record
--
page
21
of
the
record.
now
at
this
time
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
counsel
and
in
the
presence
of
the
petitioner
himself.
and
the
court
indicated
at
the
outset
that
under
this
sort
of
an
arrangement
there
would
be
no
cross-examination
of
witnesses.
at
that
point,
the
defense
counsel
indicated
to
the
court
that
he
felt
that
if
something
new
was
brought
out
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
cross-examine.
the
court
then
indicated
that
he
felt
that
the
state
should
be
protected
from
being
surprised
in
the
middle
of
a
case
and
that
we
ought
to
determine
here
at
the
outset
just
exactly
what
the
proceedings
would
be.
i
think
in
all
fairness,
this
court
was
attempting
to
adopt
a
set
of
rules
for
the
conduct
of
this
court
to
--
of
this
trial
that
everyone
understood
and
it
would
provide
one
fair
trial
for
the
defendant
and
also
a
fair
trial
for
the
state.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
termination
of
my
argument
yesterday,
i
believe
that
it
had
been
established
that
this
procedure
that
was
followed
in
the
trial
in
this
case,
the
prima
facie
case
in
which
the
state
was
only
required
to
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
all
of
the
charges
that
was
made.
but
that
the
defendant
in
the
case
had
waived
his
right
to
cross-examination
and
he
was
not
going
to
present
any
evidence
in
his
own
defense
was
initiated
to
the
court
or
mentioned
to
the
court
for
the
first
time
by
defense
counsel.
and
it
is
submitted
by
respondent
that
he
also
had
the
last
word
as
to
what
procedure
was
going
to
be
followed.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
can't
say
definitely
how
many
counties
this
is
followed
in
but
i
do
know
that
it
is
followed
in
stark
county
where
this
case
was
tried.
the
basis,
as
i
understand
it,
for
the
allowance
of
this
type
of
procedure
arose
as
a
result
of
traffic
manslaughter
cases
wherein
the
defendant
had
no
defense
against
the
charge
but
if
he
were
allowed
or
if
he
were
required,
the
man
had
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
then
this
plea
of
guilty
could
be
entered
against
him
or
could
be
considered
by
the
court
in
a
civil
action
against
him.
in
another
words,
it
practically
met
that
when
he
went
in
to
a
civil
action,
he
had
confessed
his
guilt.
now,
i
believe
that
and
i
can
only
say
this
from
what
i've
been
told
in
stark
county
because
personally
i'd
never
heard
of
that
procedure
before
myself.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
the
only
effect
is
that
he
would
not
admit
it.
he
would've
not
admitted
that
he
had
performed
the
act
which
had
caused
the
death
in
the
civil
procedure.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
think
that
the
conviction
itself
might
have
been
except
--
and
i'm
not
so
sure
of
that
but
the
fact
is
that
he
would
not
have
admitted
it
by
his
own
testimony
in
other
words.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
was
only
allowable
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
and
there
are
no
rules
that
i
know
of
that
have
provided
and
there
are
none
indicated
in
stark
county
that
there
would
such
a
rule
is
evident.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
he
had
been
provided
with
counsel
and
the
counsel
had
discussed
this
with
him.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
because
he
has
indicated
in
his
own
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
that
he
--
forth
went
the
right
of
cross-examination
and
the
confrontation
of
witnesses
because
he
had
reliance
upon
his
trial
counsel.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
the
court
never
considered
this
as
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
the
judge
indicated
to
him
that
the
outset
and
i
--
if
i
may
for
a
minute
or
two
review
what
happen
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
no,
it
definitely
was
not
done
by
rule
of
court.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
and
that
the
situation
is
this,
that
the
man
came
in
and
by
his
counsel
said,
“we
are
going
to
proceed
by
prima
facie
case.”
the
court
immediately
then
said,
“well,
in
a
prima
facie
case
then
you
will
not
do
any
cross-examining.”
i'm
saying
this
in
my
own
words.
it
is
in
the
record
exactly
as
the
court
said
it.
the
court
told
them
there
would
be
no
cross-examination.
the
defense
counsel
then
said,
“well
now
if
something
comes
up
that
may
not
implicate
the
defendant,
i
think
i
should
be
allowed
to
cross-examine.”
at
that
point
the
court
told
him,
“well
now,
we
want
everybody
to
understand
what
procedure
we're
to
follow
and
if
you
are
not
--
if
you
don't
want
to
proceed
by
the
case
that
you
have
already
propose
to
this
court,
maybe
we
should
just
have
a
jury
trial
of
it
and
let
it
go
with
that.”
then
the
court
told
them
what
he
considered
to
be
a
prima
facie
case,
a
case
in
which
not
technically
or
legally.
the
defendant
is
admitting
his
guilt
but
requires
the
state
to
prove
it.
now,
in
other
words,
in
such
a
procedure
the
burden
of
proof
does
not
shift.
there
are
still
is
no
presumption
of
guilt
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
because
the
state
still
must
prove
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
that
this
crime
was
committed.
now,
at
that
time,
it's
when
the
defendant
got
up,
he'd
been
listening
to
these
proceedings
and
he
said
to
the
court
under
no
circumstances,
“am
i
admitting
guilt
--
or
pleading
guilty?”
then
the
court
said
to
him,
“well
now,
i
would
be
happy
to
let
you
have
a
jury
trial
if
you
so
desire
even
though
you
waived
your
retrial.”
the
defendant
says,
“no,
i
want
to
be
tried
by
this
court,
i've
been
in
jail
for
18
months.”
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
this
is
born
out
by
his
petition
that
he
had
not
been
in
jail
for
18
months
but
only
two
months,
16
of
the
18
months
have
been
spent
in
another
institution.
the
court
said,
“in
all
fairness
to
him
then,
well
you
make
your
mind
whether
you
want
a
full
trial
or
whether
you
want
a
prima
facie
case?”
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
was
trying
to
give
him
every
conceivable
opportunity
to
have
this
case
proceed
in
any
way
that
he
wanted
it.
at
which
point
then,
his
counsel
got
up
and
said,
“your
honor,
all
we
want
is
a
prima
facie
case.”
in
other
words,
his
counsel
had
the
first
and
the
last
word
in
this
proceeding.
now,
counsel
for
petitioner
has
said
that
he
didn't
understand
this
proceeding
himself.
well,
this
man
is
a
lawyer,
let's
assume
that
he
has
passed
the
bar
and
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
justice
potter
the
only
--
stewart,
the
only
thing
that
i
have
in
mind
is
that
he
was
an
intelligent
man
and
was
able
to
understand
what
the
court
was
explaining
to
him
and
the
defendant
in
the
case.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
justice
white,
i'm
sure
that
that
happened,
otherwise
it
would
never
have
them
--
this
case
never
would've
been
approached
the
way
it
was.
in
other
words,
this
is
an
action
that
would've
had
to
--
have
been
determined
between
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
defense
counsel
before
it
got
into
court.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
no
sir,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
is
our
contention
that
the
last
thing
that
court
said
to
him,
“make
up
your
mind
whether
you
want
a
prima
facie
case
or
a
full
trial
of
it.”
now,
on
the
state
of
ohio,
once
a
man
has
pleaded
--
has
waived
jury
trial
and
elected
to
be
tried
by
the
court,
he
has
a
right
to
be
tried
by
the
court.
there
are
cases
i
believe
and
under
federal
law
that
that
is
something
that
is
strictly
within
the
province
of
the
court
is
to
whether
he
will
allow.
but
in
ohio
that
is
not
the
case.
if
a
man
waives
trial
by
a
jury,
then
the
court
must
try
him.
so
in
other
words,
the
trial
court
was
not
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
think
really
there
were
--
he
had
about
three
reasons
for
doing
it
this
way
and
i
think
the
one
reason
and
probably
the
one
that
who
was
foremost
in
his
mind
at
the
time
was
that
he
hope
that
by
not
putting
the
state
to
the
expense
of
a
long
and
protected
trial
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
something
by
a
way
of
mitigation
of
the
sentence
of
the
--
of
his
client.
in
other
words,
if
he
had
required
the
state
to
bring
all
this
witnesses,
handwriting
experts
perhaps
to
prove
the
signatures
and
all
of
that
sort
of
thing,
the
court
could've
been
inclined
that
it
given
the
maximum
sentence.
in
other
words,
you
run
all
of
the
sentences
consecutively.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
i
--
it
may
be
but
i
don't
know
what
was
in
the
mind
of
defense
counsel
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
but
certainly
he
had
--
and
another
reason
was
that
he
had
no
defense.
his
man
had
told
him
that
he
had
no
defense.
he
couldn't
afford
him,
the
names
of
any
witnesses
or
anything
of
that
nature.
and
i
believe
that
the
court
would've
--
if
he
had
said,
“i
want
a
trial
by
jury
or
a
trial
before
this
court.”
the
court
would've
said,
“fine,
then
let
it
go
with
that.”
mr.
leo
j.
conway
justice
brennan,
that
is
another
thing
that
i'd
like
to
clear
up
at
this
point.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
right.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that's
right.
in
this
particular
case,
a
great
number
of
checks
had
been
forged.
the
one
of
the
co-defendants
had
signed
the
name
of
mr.
buchanan,
buchanan,
i
believe
it
was,
who
was
the
treasurer
or
allegedly
the
treasurer
of
the
company
on
which
in
the
checks
were
drawn.
now,
that
signature,
l.
j.
buchanan
was
the
thing
that
constituted
the
crime
of
forgery.
that
is
this
thing
which
enabled
or
which
directed
the
bank
to
pay
these
funds.
now,
i'll
admit
that
there
was
a
very
sloppy
practice
done
by
the
stenographer
who
has
working
for
the
grand
jury,
instead
of
setting
forth
each
one
these
checks
--
four
checks
that
were
used
in
this
particular
case
she
copied
the
same
check
in
each
one.
now,
the
pay
is
named
on
three
of
these
checks
was
jimmy
cox.
the
pay
is
named
on
the
fourth
one
was
james
brookhart.
now,
the
record
will
show
that
at
page
35
and
again,
i
believe
at
page
42
that
he
had
in
his
possession
some
identification
papers
that
he
had
receive
from
some
acquaintance
of
his
by
the
name
of
jimmy
cox.
and
those
papers
were
at
once
that
were
used
for
the
purpose
of
passing
these
checks
that
were
made
out
to
jimmy
cox.
on
exhibit
c
which
was
the
basis
for
the
fifth
and
sixth
indictments,
the
named
instead
of
jimmy
cox
was
his
own
name.
when
they
got
into
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
court
allowed
and
actually
after
some
consideration
there,
he
at
first,
as
far
as
the
numbers
of
the
checks
was
concern
in
a
small
amendment
in
the
amount
of
some
of
them,
he
didn't
consider
any
question
at
all
but
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
allowing
the
amendment
as
to
the
name
of
the
payee,
he
did
have
some
concern
about
it
and
it
took
a
recess
and
after
he
came
in
and
had
apparently
have
a
chance
to
look
up
the
law,
he
said
that
this
was
only
an
amendment
as
to
a
matter
of
form,
in
other
words
the
name
of
the
payee
on
the
check
is
not
a
thing
that
constituted
the
crime
of
forgery
and
he
allowed
the
amendment.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
he
had
some
concern
about
it,
that's
what
i
say,
he
did
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
if
the
indictment
is
--
goes
to
amendment
of
substance,
in
other
words
--
in
this
particular
case
of
--
if
the
indictment
had
shown
instead
of
l.
j.
buchanan
and
l.
j.
buchanan
as
the
maker
of
the
check
if
it
had
been
some
other
name,
i
believe
that
it
might
have
been
something
that
went
to
the
substance
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
and
under
that
circumstance
he
wouldn't
have
had
to.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
where
it
goes
to
the
substance
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
prior
--
or
when
discovered
during
the
trial,
that's
another
thing.
if
this
thing
is
discovered
during
the
trial,
the
court
must
discharge
the
jury
as
of
right
now.
and
if
this
is
only
a
matter
of
form
incidentally,
which
catches
the
defendant
so
by
in
surprise
that
he
is
not
able
to
combat
it,
he
is
entitled
to
a
continuance
of
the
case
to
enable
him
to
get
any
other
evidence
that
he
may
be
able
to
dig
up
in
order
to
defend
against
that
particular
amendment.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
agree
with
that
your
honor,
but
i
also
contend
that
looking
over
the
record
as
a
whole
that
no
constitutional
right
of
this
defendant
was
violated.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
justice
stewart,
that
is
exactly
why
i
point.
that
if
there
was
no
waiver
in
this
case,
then
i've
shouldn't
be
here.
i
contend
that
there
was
a
waiver.
there
was
a
waiver
of
right
from
the
very
beginning
and
that
that
waiver
was
understood
by
the
defendant
in
the
case
and
that
at
no
time,
did
he
object
to
this
procedure
as
such
either
prior
to
or
during
the
trial
nor
even
at
the
time
of
sentencing?
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
at
the
outset,
perhaps.
but
i
--
reading
the
record
myself,
i
believe
that
the
court
made
it
adequately
clear
to
defense
counsel
as
to
what
his
concept
was.
now
after
all,
he
was
a
trial
judge
and
he
indicated
what
he
believed
it
to
be.
and
after
he
indicated
what
he
believed
it
to
be,
defense
counsel
then
said,
prima
facie
case
is
what
we
urge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
think
he
did
know.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
don't
recall
any
place
in
the
record
where
it
was
indicated
that
he
made
any
effort
to
cross-examine
the
witness.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
on
page
23,
which
you
may
be
referring
to,
23
of
the
record.
when
the
first
witness
was
put
on,
mr.
macioce
(ph)
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
offered
him,
states
exhibit
a,
for
identification.
immediately,
defense
counsel
objected
to
that.
and
the
court
said,
“well,
i
thought
that
we're
not
going
to
have
--”
and
why
the
court
said
this,
i'm
not
sure
and
i
don't
think
as
the
court
could
explain
today
what
he
meant
by
it,
he
said,
“well,
i
understood
that
you
weren't
going
to
try
this
case
on
the
merits
and
so
on.”
but
the
first
thing
that
was
done
was
an
objection
by
defense
counsel
to
something
before
it
was
any
objection
was
an
order
or
whatsoever.
in
other
words,
he
knew
as
the
time
what
was
--
what
he
contended
to
be
wrong
with
that
check.
he
knew
that
this
check
deviated
or
varied
from
the
indictment
and
ultimately
that
(voice

--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
the
only
thing
mr.
justice
fortas
and
i
can
say
in
that
regard
is
that
the
judge
used
every
constitutional
rule
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
--
to
ensure
that
the
man
had
a
fair
trial
when
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
in
ohio,
he
is
supposed
to
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
--
well,
in
five
days
after
conviction,
unless
he
appeals.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
i
would
say
less.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
would
say
definitely
less
because
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
in
the
county
jail.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that's
right.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that's
right.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that's
right.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
of
course,
that
was
the
other
reason
that
i
felt
that
he
was
interested
in
getting
this
thing
over
with.
i
don't
think
he
had
any
attention
that
he
was
going
to
be
acquitted
and
that
he
want
us
to
get
back
where
he
would
be
able
to
start
serving
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
he
would
not
at
that
time,
your
honor,
but
he
would
today.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that's
right.
thank
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
no,
i
don't
know
what
the
judge
meant
and
why
he
said
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that's
possible.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
no
i
--
you're
--
that's
right
your
honor.
i
think
--
what
i'm
trying
to
convey
is
that
the
judge
said
something,
this
came
as
a
surprise
to
him
as
a
result
of
the
very
first
witness
being
on
and
before
anything
was
done,
the
man
objected
and
the
judge
said
that
made
the
statement,
“why
--
i
don't
know
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
statement
meant
and
i
don't
know
what
he
had
in
mind
when
he
made
it.”
that's
what
i
tried
to
convey.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
still
think
that
he
understood
that
the
court
--
that
the
state
was
going
to
have
to
prove
a
case
against
him
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
and
i
think
that
the
record
as
a
whole
indicates
of
the
state
did
and
this
is
a
one
count
that
was
not
proved
by
the
state,
the
judge
found
him
not
guilty.
i
think
that
the
judge
throughout
use
the
constitutional
standard
of
innocence
or
guilt
and
acted
accordingly.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it's
generally
is
quite
behind.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
know
that
it's
very
much
behind
because
i
know
one
case
where
a
man
has
been
waiting
trial
for
at
least
four
or
five
months.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
they
are
getting
credit.
i
beg
your
pardon,
no
sir.
they
don't
get
credit
until
after
the
verdict.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
i
--
as
i
say
your
honor,
i
--
the
only
one
that
i
know
of
is
in
this
particular
county
because
actually
it's
the
only
one
i
checked
of.
i
didn't
say
--
i
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
go
to
other
counties
to
find
out
what
they
did.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
oh
i'm
sure
that
he
does
not.
no
sir,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
is
something
that
definitely
was
brought
up
between
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
defense
counsel.
incidentally,
he'd
been
appointed
a
month
or
so
ahead
of
this
time
and
we'd
had
ample
opportunity
to
discuss
this.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
10
years,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
thank
you
very
much.
