mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
stands
convicted
upon
three
counts
of
forgery,
three
counts
of
uttering
forged
documents,
one
count
of
breaking
and
entering
an
uninhabited
dwelling
in
the
night
season,
and
one
count
of
grand
larceny.
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
pursuant
to
a
provision
which
allows
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
exercise
original
jurisdiction
in
such
actions
attacking
the
conviction
upon
the
basis
of
which
he
was
incarcerated.
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
denied.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
review
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
petitioner
was
tried
and
convicted
in
a
trial
in
which
he
was
denied
the
right
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
who
appeared
against
him.
he
was
denied
the
right
to
confront
certain
of
the
witnesses
who
appeared
against
him
by
statement
alone.
he
was
denied
the
right
to
have
adequate
notice
of
the
charges
upon
which
he
was
ultimately
convicted.
he
was
charged
by
indictment
upon
--
with
certain
offenses.
he
was
tried
upon
entirely
different
offenses.
petitioner
contends
that
in
these
circumstances
he
was
denied
the
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
witnesses
against
him
in
violation
of
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
he
was
denied
the
right
to
contest
the
state's
case
by
any
means
whatsoever
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
he
was
denied
the
right
to
adequate
notice
of
the
charges
upon
which
he
was
ultimately
convicted
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
and
the
sixth
amendments.
the
circumstances
which
give
rise
to
these
claims
are
contained
in
a
record
not
of
very
great
length.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
pages
20
and
21
of
the
record.
a
colloquy
occurs
upon
those
pages
which
gives
rise
to
the
controversy
presently
before
this
court.
in
that
colloquy,
defense
counsel,
appointed
counsel,
first
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
that
the
case
was
before
the
court
on
a
prima
facie
case.
i
might
state
at
this
point
that
there
was
no
such
thing
formerly
known
under
the
law
of
ohio
as
a
prima
facie
case,
at
least
in
the
circumstances
of
a
criminal
trial.
so,
this
is
not
a
term
which
had
a
clearly
defined
meaning
at
the
time
the
statement
was
made.
the
court
however,
attempts
to
articulate
or
express
what
a
prima
facie
case
is,
and
the
court
states,
“there's
going
to
be
no
cross-examination
of
the
witnesses
so
the
court
will
know
and
the
state
can't
be
taken
by
surprise.
the
court
doesn't
want
to
be
fooled
and
have
your
client
change
his
mind
halfway
through
the
trial
and
really
contest
it.”
the
state
has
a
contest
we
want
to
know
in
fairness
to
them
so
they
can
put
on
complete
proof.
at
that
point,
defense
counsel
attempted
to
reserve
the
right
of
cross-examination.
the
court,
however,
advised
him
that
if
the
case
were
tried
as
a
prima
facie
case,
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
cross-examine
at
all.
and
then
added,
ordinarily
on
a
prima
facie
case,
the
prima
facie
case
is
where
the
defendant
not
technically
or
legally
in
effect,
admits
his
guilt
and
wants
the
state
to
prove
it.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
i
did
not
learn
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
until
the
state's
brief
was
filed
in
this
case
and
i
was
unadvised
by
the
state
that
this
is
a
common
practice
in
certain
circumstances.
if
it
is
a
common
practice,
it
is
a
practice
of
which
i
am
totally
unfamiliar
and
furthermore,
it
is
a
practice
with
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
apparently
unfamiliar
because
the
ohio
supreme
court
groping
for
some
means
to
justify
the
very
unusual
procedure
which
occurred
in
this
case
held
that
this
was
comparable
to
a
no
contest
plea
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
no
contest
plea
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
--
in
the
state
of
ohio
in
felony
cases.
and
the
court
--
the
ohio
supreme
court
recognize
this
as
a
rather
unusual
procedure
but
said
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
an
unusual
procedure,
there
was
no
reason
for
not
accepting
it
if
it
in
fact,
corresponded
or
protected
all
of
the
defendant's
rights.
of
course,
we
submit
that
it
didn't.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
no,
your
honor.
there
is
certainly
much
confusion
left
with
respect
to
what
a
prima
facie
case
(inaudible)
--
case
is.
we
do
know
that
in
the
mind
of
the
court,
it
meant
no
cross-examination.
we
do
know
that
in
the
mind
of
the
court,
it
meant
no
contest
by
any
means
whatsoever.
we
do
know
in
the
mind
of
the
court
that
it
was
not
a
trial
on
the
merits.
on
page
23,
the
court,
when
mr.
ergazos,
who
was
defense
counsel,
asserted
his
first
objection
to
evidence
which
the
state
attempted
to
introduce,
mr.
ergazos
objected,
the
court
said,
“are
you
trying
the
case
on
the
merits
or
just
want
the
state
to
make
a
prima
facie
case?”
so,
apparently,
it
is
not
a
trial
on
the
merits.
now,
we
do
not
know
whether
a
prima
facie
case
requires
the
state
to
establish
proof
--
guilt
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
record
strongly
indicates
that
it
does
not
that
there
must
merely
be
some
evidence
or
perhaps
substantial
evidence,
but
whether
it
was
required
to
establish
guilt
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
a
matter
left
in
very
substantial
doubt.
we
don't
know
what
a
prima
facie
case
is.
the
petitioner
apparently
had
some
notion
though
of
what
was
going
on
and,
when
he
saw
what
was
going
on,
he
brought
his
objection
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
and,
the
time
at
which
he
made
that
objection,
the
sequence
in
which
the
objection
occurs
is
of
substantial
importance
in
this
case
because,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
state
is
able
to
make
even
a
pretense
of
justifying
the
fairness
of
what
occurred
in
this
case
only
by
ignoring
an
important
part
of
the
record.
the
court
stated,
the
court
knowing
that
and
the
prosecutor
knowing
that
instead
of
having
a
half-dozen
witnesses
on
one
point,
they
only
have
one
because
they
were
--
well,
they
understand
there
will
be
no
contest.
now,
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
defendant
for
the
first
time
says,
“i
would
like
to
point
out
in
no
way
am
i
pleading
guilty
to
this
charge.”
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
this
is
on
page
22
of
the
record.
now,
the
state
ignores
the
intervening
paragraph
and
suggests
that
the
defendant
was
asserting
this
protest
solely
to
the
court's
statement
which
appears
on
the
bottom
of
page
21,
the
court
statement
being
a
prima
facie
case
is
one
in
which
the
defendant,
not
technically
or
legally
in
effect
admits
his
guilt
and
wants
the
state
to
prove
it.
that
isn't
specifically
what
he
was
objecting
to
although
one
might
assume
that
he
was
objecting
to
that
as
well.
but
he
was
objecting
to
the
proposition
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
contest
in
this
case.
and
the
court
said,
“if
you
want
to
stand
trial,
we
will
give
you
a
jury
trial.”
now,
as
petitioner
contends
and
as
the
state
acknowledges,
in
the
state
of
ohio
the
defendant
has
an
absolute
right
to
waive
jury
trial.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
discretion
with
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
should
be
permitted
to
waive
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
he
did
waive
his
right
to
jury
trial
here
and
he
could
demand
a
trial
by
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
your
honor,
trial
counsel
did
acquiesce
to
a
prima
facie
case.
he
did
not
demonstrate
that
he
knew
what
was
all
--
what
it
was
all
about.
he
quite
clearly
did
not
demonstrate
that
because
he
attempted
to
reserve,
for
example,
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses.
he
thought
by
entering
this
plea
whatever
it
was,
he
could
reserve
that
right
should
anything
new
be
brought
out.
but
the
court
advised
him
that
he
could
not
reserve
that
right.
in
addition,
he
apparently
thought
that
he
could
assert
objection
to
evidence
which
he
considered
inadmissible
but
the
trial
court
apparently
thought
that
he
had
waived
that
right
also
by
agreeing
to
have
a
prima
facie
case
tried
by
the
court.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
no
one
could
know
what
a
prima
facie
case
was
precisely
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
or
any
other
case.
the
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
he
did
nothing
which
could
be
imputed
to
petitioner
as
a
waiver
for
two
reasons,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
the
first
reason
is
that
it
is
quite
obvious
from
the
record
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
waiving
and
at
the
very
least,
in
order
to
find
waiver
or
in
order
to
impute
waiver
by
counsel
to
one's
client,
the
record
should
contain
some
indication
that
the
waiver
by
the
attorney
was
made
intelligently.
this
record
contains
no
such
indication.
the
contrary
demonstrates
that
it
was
not
made
intelligently.
and,
secondly,
even
assuming
that
it
had
been
made
intelligently,
even
assuming
that
the
attorney
didn't
know
what
a
prima
facie
case
was,
the
defendant
here
specifically
objected
to
the
proceeding
which
was
about
to
ensue.
an
uncontested
proceeding
in
which
the
state
was
apparently
relieved
of
the
obligation
of
establishing
guilt
by
traditional
standards
and
of
having
its
case
subjected
to
traditional
truth
testing
devices,
an
out-and-out
waiver.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
he
added
immediately
below
when
the
court
said,
“if
you
want
to
stand
trial,
we
will
give
you
a
jury
trial.”
the
defendant
said,
“i
have
been
incarcerated
now
for
the
last
18
months
in
the
county
jail.”
the
court
quickly
advised
him
that
he
would
not
receive
credit
for
that.
the
defendant
then
stated,
“for
over
two
months,
my
nerves
have
been
shut.
i
couldn't
stand
it
out
there
any
longer.
i
would
like
to
be
tried
by
this
court.”
now,
he
first
objected
to
the
court's
implication
that
this
would
be
a
no
contest
case
that
this
plea
was
in
effect,
though
not
technically
or
legally
a
plea
of
guilty
and
he
secondly
rejected
the
court's
offer
of
a
jury
trial
stating
that
he
wanted
to
be
tried
by
the
court.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
statement
should
not
be
deemed
a
waiver
of
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
which
the
petitioner
lost
by
--
apparently
by
virtue
of
that
statement
for
several
reasons,
some
of
which
i
have
already
mentioned.
these
were
the
personal
rights
of
the
accused
that
were
involved.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
we
call
them
tactical
or
strategic
or
what
we
call
them.
every
right
that
the
accused
has
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
his
right.
now,
the
needs
of
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
required
the
establishment
of
certain
rules
whereby
those
rights
are
exercised
by
counsel.
nonetheless,
they
remain
the
personal
rights
of
the
accused.
it
is
the
accused
who
went
to
jail
in
this
case
and
not
his
attorney.
since
they
are
the
personal
rights
of
the
accused
where
the
accused
attempts
to
assert
those
rights
as
he
did
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
a
statement
by
his
attorney
which
is
quite
clearly
demonstrated
to
be
made
without
full
knowledge
of
its
consequences
should
not
be
deemed
a
waiver
of
those
critical
constitutional
rights
involved
in
this
case.
now,
it
is
true,
the
attorney
did
make
the
statement,
what
he
intended
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
knew
what
was
intended
by
that
statement
or
whether
anyone
knew
what
was
intended
by
that
statement
is
a
matter
in
very
substantial
doubt.
there
is
one
thing
that
is
perfectly
clear
upon
this
record.
the
defendant
was
denied
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses
and
he
was
denied
the
right,
not
only
with
respect
to
witnesses
who
actually
appeared
in
the
courtroom,
but
the
--
perhaps
a
very
critical
testimony
in
this
case
involved
the
statement
of
an
alleged
co-offender,
mr.
ronald
mitchell,
and
that
a
statement
of
that
alleged
co-offender
was
introduced
over
objection,
on
page
39
of
the
record.
now,
this
is
a
situation
where
critical
testimony
is
presented
against
the
petitioner
not
by
a
witness
who
appears
in
court,
who
is
subject
to
evaluation
for
purposes
of
determining
his
credibility
at
least
by
seeing
him
if
not
by
cross-examination,
assuming
that
that
had
been
waived,
but
this
is
testimony
which
appears
in
the
case
and
which
is
relied
upon
virtually
entirely
by
the
court
in
finding
the
petitioner
guilty
of
at
least
two
of
the
offenses
charged
and
it
is
testimony
which
is
submitted
to
no
test
for
purposes
of
determining
credibility.
the
petitioner
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
confront
this
witness
face-to-face.
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
this
witness.
now,
if
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes,
your
honor,
he
could've.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes,
he
could
have.
i
assume
that
he
certainly
could
have,
and
he
did
raise
jury
trial.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
no,
your
honor.
he
didn't
have
his
choice
between
a
jury
trial
and
a
trial
in
which
he
was
going
to
face
all
of
these
witnesses.
that
isn't
the
choice
that
was
put
to
him
by
statute.
he
has
the
right
to
choose
between
two
things.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
your
honor,
i
submit
that
it
does.
when
he
chose
to
be
tried
by
the
court,
he
had
a
statutory
right
to
make
that
choice.
having
made
that
choice,
it
was
necessary
for
the
court
to
provide
him
with
a
trial
in
accordance
with
all
constitutional
safeguards
available
to
the
accused
in
any
criminal
case.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
unless
he's
waived
those.
and
he
doesn't
waive
those
rights
mr.
justice
harlan,
by
agreeing
that
he
does
not
want
a
jury
trial.
he
wants
to
be
tried
by
the
court.
and
i
certainly
know
of
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
it
can
be
argued
your
honor
and
if
this
court
accepts
the
proposition
that
the
ambiguous
ambivalent
statement
of
counsel
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
made
over
the
direct
protest
of
the
petitioner
constitutes
a
waiver,
we
are
out
of
court.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
we
have
a
problem,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that's
a
--
it
certainly
is
a
henry
versus
mississippi
and
fay
versus
noia
type
problem
and
the
question
presented
in
both
of
those
cases
is
whether
the
federal
constitutional
claim
was
waived
by
conduct
which
could
be
considered
deliberate,
intentional,
motivated
by
technical
or
strategic--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
i'm
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
court
did
so
decide.
my
understanding
of
the
decision
in
henry
versus
mississippi
was
the
case
was
remanded
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
waiver
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case
was
intentionally
made
for
the
purpose
of
bypassing
state
procedures.
there's
nothing
in
this
case
that
suggests
that
but
apart
from
that,
there's
a
different
kind
of
right,
i
would
submit,
involved
in
henry
versus
mississippi
than
there
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
right
involved
in
henry
versus
mississippi
was
the
right
to
object
to
evidence
illegally
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
right
involved
in
this
case
is
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
a
very
fundamental
kind
of
thing.
the
right
to
notice
of
the
charges,
the
right
to
be
able
to
prepare
to
meet
those
charges,
the
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
witnesses,
the
right
to
have
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
determined
in
a
reasonably
fair
proceeding.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
and
that
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
i
think
it's
something
even
more
fundamental
than
the
case
cited
which
i
believe
was
whitus
versus
balkcom.
this
is
much
more
fundamental,
i
submit,
than
whitus
versus
balkcom.
this
is
the
right
as
already
indicated,
the
right
to
a
fair
and
rational
guilt-determining
process.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
it
certainly
is,
you
honor.
it
is
the--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
alright,
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
i
do
stand
corrected
and
at
every
point
in
petitioner's
brief
where
the
term
“trial”
is
mentioned,
it
will
be
found
in
quotes
because
petitioner
does
not
agree
that
this
is
or
was
a
trial.
this
was
a
procedure
unlike
any
that
i
had
--
been
seen
previously
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
perhaps
unlike
any
previously
seen
by
this
court,
a
procedure
in
which
not
only
did
the
witnesses
appear
and
testify
without
being
submitted
to
cross-examination,
not
only
was
certain
testimony
taken
by
out
of
court
wit
--
or
from
out
of
court
witnesses
despite
the
fact
that
their
statements
were
under
no
conceivable
rule
of
law,
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule,
thus,
calling
forth
the
rule
applicable
or
deemed
applicable
by
this
court
in
pointer
versus
texas
and
douglas
versus
alabama.
but
in
addition,
after
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
had
committed
himself,
assuming
that
he
had,
assuming
that
his
attorney
could
commit
himself,
the
state
changed
the
rules
of
the
game.
they
no
longer
tried
him
upon
the
offenses
upon
which
he
was
indicted.
instead,
the
state
when
it
attempted
to
introduce
the
check
and
support
of
counts
1
and
2
of
the
indictment
found
it
necessary
to
move
the
--
to
amend
the
indictment
by
changing
both
the
name
--
i'm
sorry,
the
number
of
the
check
involved
and
the
amounts
involved.
it
found
it
necessary
to
amend
the
indictment
to
conform
to
its
proof
with
respect
to
counts
3
and
4
by
changing
the
number
of
the
check
upon
which
those
counts
were
predicated.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
your
honor,
i
submit
that
those
are
very
material
amendments.
it
will
not
solve
the
problem
raised
here
to
ask
whether
or
not
these
are
matters
of
form
or
matters
of
substance.
these
are
material
amendments
which
affect
the
ability
of
the
accused
to
meet
the
charges
against
him
which
affect
his
ability
to
obtain
notice
of
the
charges
upon
which
he
is
to
be
tried
and
to
perform
that
which
he
is
to
perform
with
that
notice,
that
is
prepare
for
trial.
now,
with
respect
to
counts
5
and
6,
if
anything,
the
amendments
were
far
more
material,
and
that,
not
only
the
number
of
the
check
had
to
be
changed,
the
amount
had
to
be
changed.
then
the
name
of
the
payee
apparently
had
to
be
filled
in
and
then
the
name
of
the
payee
had
to
be
changed.
now,
it's
suggested
by
the
state
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
these
aren't
material
because
the
name
of
the
offense
remained
the
same.
in
other
words,
according
to
the
state
and
for
that
matter
according
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
it
is
adequate
for
purposes
of
apprising
the
accused
of
the
charges
which
he
must
be
prepared
to
meet
to
simply
apprise
him
of
the
name
of
the
offense
with
which
he
is
charged.
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
he
was
apprised
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
all
of
those
amendments
were
objected
to,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
federal
system.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes,
subject
to
a
motion
for
a
bill
of
particulars
and
subject
to
certain
exceptions
that
might
be
applicable
to
particular
offenses.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
and
indeed,
had
the
accused
in
this
case
--
had
petitioner
simply
been
charged
from
the
general
statutory
language,
the
statutes
which
--
with
which
he
was
charged
of
having
violated,
he
could
have
move
for
a
bill
of
particulars
and
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
bill
of
particulars
as
a
matter
of
right
but
he
had
no
reason
to
move
for
a
bill
of
particulars.
the
indictment
did
spell
out
the
specifics
of
the
offenses
upon
--
with
which
he
was
charged.
then
the
specifics
changed.
so
he
was
advised
that
he
was
to
be
tried
upon
particular
offenses
and
when
the
time
for
trial
came,
he
was
tried
upon
entirely
different
offenses.
so
even
if
we
assume
the
truth
of
the
correctness
of
the
ohio
supreme
court's
observation
that
it
is
adequate
for
purposes
of
providing
notice,
though
this
court
has
suggested
at
least
in
federal
cases
that
it
is
necessary
to
descend
to
particulars,
assuming
that
its
not
necessary
to
descend
for
--
to
particulars
in
an
indictment
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
this
indictment
did
descend
to
particulars.
this
indictment
did
charge
this
man
with
specific
offenses.
this
man
did
come
to
trial
presumably
prepared
to
defend
against
those
offenses
but
this
man
was
not
tried.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
james
cox
or
jimmy
cox
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
--
is
presumably
the
name
of
a
person
who
lived
in
georgia,
from
whom
someone
had
obtained
a
driver's
license
and
other
means
of
identification.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
james
brookhart
was
somebody
else.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
that's
right.
with
do
--
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
with
respect
to
counts
5
and
6
of
the
indictment,
the
name
of
the
payee
was
changed
from
jimmy
cox
to
james
brookhart.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
you
can
pursuant
to
a
statute
amend
an
indictment
at
any
time
during
trial
pursue
--
provided
that
the
name
and
identity
of
the
offenses
or
of
the
offense
charged
is
not
changed
and
provided
that
in
certain
circumstances,
it
does
not
prejudice
the
accused.
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
interpreting
that
statute
in
a
context
of
this
case
has
suggested
that
the
identity
wasn't
changed
because
the
name
remained
the
same.
the
name
of
the
original
offenses
charged
was
forgery.
the
name
of
the
offenses
upon
which
the
petitioner
was
ultimately
tried
was
forgery.
since
the
name
didn't
change,
the
amendment
in
this
case
was
in
full
compliance
with
the
applicable
statute
and
therefore
proper.
now,
petitioner
submits
that,
assuming
that
that
is
an
accurate
interpretation
of
course,
this
court
is
not
going
to
interpret
the
ohio
statutes
and
the
ohio
statute
is
unconstitutional,
if
not,
as
written
certainly
as
applied.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
no,
there
was
no
motion
for
continuance
and
the
state
suggests
that,
for
that
reason,
the
right
to
adequate
notice
of
the
charges
upon
which
the
petitioner
was
tried
was
weighed.
i
submit
that
no
waiver
should
be
found
in
those
circumstances
for
at
least
two
reasons.
one
is,
the
state
itself,
having
had
ample
opportunity
to
study
the
question
of
how
this
kind
of
question
can
be
raised,
suggest
that
the
waiver
raised
by
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
that's
just
wrong.
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
lies
only
for
errors
or
defects
which
appear
upon
the
face
of
the
indictment
and
there
was
no
defect
upon
the
face
of
the
indictment.
so,
the
state,
through
very
learned
counsel
after
ample
opportunity
to
examine
the
law
of
the
state
of
ohio
didn't
know
how
this
kind
of
question
was
to
be
raised
more
specifically
and
suggest
the
way
that
is
wrong.
secondly,
assuming
that
a
continuance
could
have
been
requested
and
it
could
have
been
requested
pursuant
to
statute.
it
was
entirely
proper
for
counsel
in
this
case
not
to
request
a
continuance
because
a
continuance
would
not
have
cured
the
failure
to
provide
adequate
notice
which
had
already
transpired.
this
defendant
was
indicted
in
march
of
1962
--
march
3rd
of
1962
--
i'm
sorry,
of
1961.
he
was
brought
for
trial
on
january
29,
1962.
between
that
period
of
time,
he
was
either
in
tallahassee,
florida
in
a
federal
penitentiary
or
he
was
in
springfield,
missouri
in
a
mental
hospital.
he
was
charged
with
those
offenses
in
march
of
1961.
by
a
statute
in
ohio,
it
was
necessary
to
serve
a
copy
of
the
indictment
on
him
in
march
of
1961.
he
had
every
right
to
rely
upon
the
notion
that
he
was
to
face
trial
upon
those
charges.
his
trial
upon
those
charges
was
delayed
for
a
period
of
one
year.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
he
could
have
prepared
to
meet
the
new
offenses
charged
at
the
time
of
trial
simply
by
requesting
a
continuance
as
in
a
case
recently
decided
by
this
court.
particularly
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
mental
condition
of
the
accused
might
have
been
relevant,
the
failure
to
provide
adequate
notice
at
a
time
when
it
would
have
permitted
petitioner
to
prepare
to
meet
the
charges
upon
which
he
was
tried
could
not
have
been
cured
by
a
motion
for
a
continuance
or
the
granting
of
a
continuance.
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
two
questions
propounded
by
members
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
asked
whether
or
not
the
fundamental
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
basic
fundamental
constitutional
rights
which
were
admittedly
denied.
i
submit
that
upon
this
record,
it
cannot
be
found
that
there
was
a
waiver
as
a
constitutional
matter
as
this
court
said
as
long
ago
as
johnson
versus
zerbst,
a
waiver
is
ordinarily
and
intentional
relinquishment
or
abandonment
of
a
known
right
or
privilege.
upon
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
cannot
be
found
an
intentional
relinquishment
or
abandonment
of
a
known
right
or
privilege
for
at
least
five
reasons.
one,
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
judge
didn't
know
what
kind
of
proceeding
was
involved
in
this
case.
two,
it's
quite
obvious
that
defense
counsel
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
which
was
about
to
ensue.
he
did
not
understand
for
example
that
he
could
not
reserve
the
right
to
cross-examination.
three,
even
today,
the
state
doesn't
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
which
did
in
fact
ensue
upon
whom
to
the
burden
of
proof
rests
and
the
state's
own
brief
that
suggest
that
perhaps
it
rested
upon
the
defendant,
perhaps
not
the
standard
of
proof
is
unclear
entirely
too
much
confusion
to
assume
that
anyone
knew
what
kind
of
right
was
being
waived.
four,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
this
is
not
a
case
whether
the
defendant
remain
silent.
this
is
a
case
where
the
defendant
specifically
asserted
an
objection.
and
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
the
objection
was
asserted
in
plain
enough
terms
for
the
court
to
understand
what
the
objection
was,
and
that
is
that
this
objection
satisfied
the
requirement
established
by
this
court
for
purposes
of
determining
procedurally
whether
an
objection
is
adequate.
it
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
fact
that
a
matter
was
being
protested
on
page
22
of
the
record
when
the
defendant,
now
petitioner
did
object,
the
court
responded,
“make
up
your
mind,
whether
you
require
a
prima
facie
case
or
a
complete
trial”,
that
court
understood
that
an
objection
was
being
made.
part
from
the
fact
that
there
was
a
specific
objection
being
made
in
this
case,
an
additional
factor
which
would
indicate
that
the
waiver
was
not
voluntary
and
intentional
as
the
fact
that
defendant
had
been
incarcerated.
petitioner
had
been
incarcerated
and
that
this
decision
on
his
part
to
forego
a
jury
trial
was
motivated
at
least
in
part
by
his
reason
to
get
this
case
over
with.
now,
mr.
justice
white
has
asked,
what
kind
of
choice
the
defendant
or
petitioner
was
confronted
with
and
whether
or
not
the
offering
by
the
court
of
a
choice
between
a
nonjury
trial
--
i'm
sorry,
between
a
jury
trial
and
a
prima
facie
case
presents
a
constitutional
question.
of
course,
it
doesn't.
if
in
fact
the
choice
of
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
made,
the
requirement
of
ohio
law
that
the
defendant
be
permitted
to
waive
jury
trial
if
he
decides
to
do
so
is
a
not
a
constitutional
requirement.
but
that
is
not
the
choice
that
confronted
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
choice
that
confronted
him
was
a
choice
between
a
trial
and
no
trial.
he
chose
a
trial.
he
was
denied
a
trial.
for
these
reasons,
petitioner
urges
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
thank
you.
and
mr.
conway,
we
of
course
appreciate
your
diligent
representation
of
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
gerald
a.
messerman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
attribute
at
least
half
the
work
to
my
colleague,
mr.
herman.
