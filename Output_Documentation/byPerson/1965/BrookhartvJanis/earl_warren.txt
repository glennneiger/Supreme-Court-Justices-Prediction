chief

you
may
mr.
messerman.
mr.
conway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
last
--
i
didn't
hear
it.
i
didn't
understand
that
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
also
found
this
in
a
mental
hospital
too,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
he'd
been
drinking
in
the
penitentiary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
he
is
--
you
don't
mean
he
was
carrying
on
the
habit
in
the
penitentiary,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he'd
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
it
was
sometime
between
the
time
that
he
was
convicted
that
--
between
the
time
he
was
arrested
and
went
to
jail
and
the
time
he
was
convicted
and
sent
to
a
penitentiary,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
all
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
these
other
things
you're
telling
me
about
that
he
said
he
had
no
defense
he
knew
of
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
brief,
but
that
isn't
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
it
in
the
record
if
that's
what
you're
relying
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
told
us
--
as
i
understood,
you
told
us
that
at
the
outset,
you're
dealing
here
with
a
man
who
went
--
was
assigned
a
lawyer
whom
he
told
he
had
no
lawyer,
that
he'd
been
drunk
and
did
all
of
these
things
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
left
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
the
trial?
was
that
at
the
trial
or
was
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
habeas
corpus?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
oh,
of
course,
yes,
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

james
brookhart,
petitioner,

director

ohio
department
of

hygiene
and
corrections.
mr.
conway,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
provided
by
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
provided
by
rules
of
the
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
provided
by
rules
of
that
--
of
this
trial
court
that
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
ask
you
the
rules.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
expect
the
man
to
know
what
he
was
going
up
against
when
he
ask
for,
when
he
consented
to
a
prima
facie
trial?
how
would
he
know
what
his
rights
were
and
what
his
obligation
were?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
told
the
court
he
was
not
in
any
sense
pleading
guilty,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
some
of
the
statements
the
judge
made
were
tantamount
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
review
it
in
your
own
way,
i
want
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
just
want
to
know
about
those
rules
whether
it
is
--
whether
was
a
--
it
was
just
an
improvised
procedure
in
this
county
or
whether
it
was
done
by
rule
of
court
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
conway,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
few
moments
ago
that
you
doubted
it
to
this
day,
the
judge
knew
what
he
meant
at
the
time
of
a
trial.
and
i
wonder
if
in
those
circumstances,
you
feel
that
the
defendant
should
be
chargeable
with
knowing
what
the
judge
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
you
doubted
to
this
day
if
the
judge
himself
knew?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
i
didn't
make
it
up
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
weren't
that
pretty
ambiguous
proceeding
entitled
when
there
are
no
rules,
there'd
no
way
either
lawyer
or
clients
could
know
what
kind
of
a
trial
he
was
going
to
get
and
to
have
you
here
in
the
supreme
court,
the
united
states
say
that
you
don't
know
to
this
day
what
the
judge
meant
what
he
said
certain
things
and
you
doubt
if
the
judge
himself
knew.
but
instead
you
say
there
was
a
clear
waiver
on
the
part
of
this
man
after
he
once
told
the
judge
that
he
was
in
no
sense
pleading
guilty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
messerman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
messerman,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
should
like
to
express
its
appreciation
to
you
for
having
--
accepting
--
accepted
the
assignment
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant.
we
consider
that
to
be
a
real
public
service
and
in
the
interest
of
the
administration
of
justice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
of
course,
that
we
will
extend
to
you
also.
