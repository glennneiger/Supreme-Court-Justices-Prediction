but
he
had
his
choice,
and
he
had

justice

mr.
conway,
what
in
some
conversation
which
isn't
in
the
record
between
the
defendant's
lawyer
and
the
prosecutor
before
they
ever
came
to
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
he
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
court
was
willing
to
give
him
any
kind
of
a
trial
he
wanted
but
it
really
wasn't,
was
it?
he
gave
him
a
choice
between
a
prima
facie
--
prima
facie
trial
and
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
explain
to
me
then
why
the
defendant
or
the
defendant's
counsel
would
choose
a
prima
facie
case
rather
than
a
full
trial
by
the
court
without
a
jury?
justice
byron
r.

that's
a
pretty
poor
reasoning.

and
then
while
you're
doing
it
they
also
dismissed
to
other
accounts

justice

for
failure
of
proof.

mr.

one
more
question.
how
current
is
the
docket
in

county?
do
you
know?
the
criminal
docket.
justice
byron

but
they
are
--
but
if
they
had
--
they
are
out
on
--
they
are
getting
credit
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
do
you
know
whether
there
has
been
any
noticeable
follow
up
in
the
number
of
prima
facie
trials
since
you've
change
this
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
--
prosecutor
just
let
him
sit
there
and
until
they're
ready
to
agree
to
a
prima
