mr.
messerman,
you
said
that
in
your
studies
preparing
for
this
argument
you
found
those
such
anomalous
as
anywhere
in
ohio
and
that
confirms
my
recollection,
but
did
you
learn
that
in
this
county
or
in
some
counties
this
is
a
--
this
is
the
usual
way
of
proceeding
in
a
criminal
case,
did
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
have
that
either
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
colloquy,
the
--
there's
an
implication
that
this
judge
in
this
county,
this
was
all
--
it's
up
to
him.
did
he
define
what
a
prima
facie
proceeding
was?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
this?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
--
all
the
defendant
said
is
this
one
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
pretty
much
the
federal
system,
isn't
it?
you
just
charge
him
with
the
name
of
the
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
subject
to
--
this
motion
for
a
bill
of
particulars
of
course.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
your
notice
point,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
in
passing
the
bar
wouldn't
give
him
any
knowledge
of
this
procedure,
you
never
heard
it?
the
supreme
courts
never
heard
of
it,
i
never
heard
of
it,
i
lived
many
years
in
ohio.
justice
potter
stewart
it
really
comes
down
to,
isn't
it,
here
as
whether
or
not
there
was
a
waiver
because
certainly
you
and
i
would
agree
i
suppose
that
the
right
to
plead
not
guilty
and
thereafter
the
right
to
confrontation.
those
are
very,
very
important
constitutional
rights.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
suppose
we'd
both
agree
that
those
rights
can
be
waived.
and
they
are
waived
by
a
voluntary
plea
of
guilty.
and
i
suppose
they
could
be
waived
by
an
agreement
between
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
of
voluntary
and
free
agreement
and
it
doesn't
this
case
falls
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
such
a
waiver?
justice
potter
stewart
although
--
wouldn't
you
further
agree
that
the
record,
as
one
raise
it,
indicates
that
there
was
a
--
it
contains
some
ambiguity
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
real
meeting
of
the
minds
between
the
defense
counsel
and
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor,
that
is,
each
was
using
the
shorthand
term
prima
facie
case
but
it
isn't
there
are
some
indication
from
the
record
that
the
two
parties
meant
different
things
by
that
shorthand
expression?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
defends
counsel
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
then
he
later
tried
to
cross-examine
a
witness
and
indicating
that
he's
understood,
that
his
defense
counsel's
understanding
of
that
shorthand
expression
included
his
right
to
cross-examine
the
prosecution's
witnesses
at
least
in
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
i
had
seen
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
he
had
been
at
the
bar,
mr.
conway?
