justice
abe

i'm
sorry
sir.
does
this
record
look
to
you
as
if
everybody
was
making
up
the
rules
as
it
went
along,
including
the
judge?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
words
prima
facie
--
if
you're
talking
about
a
prima
facie
case
in
ordinary
lawyers'
parlance,
you
are
talking
about
the
quantum
of
proof
and
not
the
method
that
making
the
proof,
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
seem
to
be
a,
shall
i
say,
slight
ambiguities
from
time-to-time
with
the
judge's
mind
on
that
concept.
mr.
conway,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
note
that
the
prisoner's
statement,
the
accused
statement
on
page
22.
prior
to
trial
is
a
prisoner
out
there
held
in
the
county
jail
and
then
if
he
is
convicted
he
is
sent
to
a
penitentiary,
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
abe
fortas
now
before
--
while
he
is
there
waiting
for
trial
for
these
two
months
that
he
was
in
the
county
jail,
he
--
for
two
months,
he
was
in
the
county
jail,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
a
county
jail
a
place
of
closed
incarceration
and
is
there
a
distinction
between
what
happens
to
a
prisoner
of
a
county
jail
and
what
happens
to
him
in
the
penitentiary?
in
other
words,
is
a
more
liberty
available
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
penitentiary
within
the
prisoner
category?
justice
abe
fortas
less
independent
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
county
jail?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
because
as
i
read
this,
it
seems
to
me
--
on
page
22,
it
seems
to
that
what
the
prisoner
said
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
he
says,
he
have
been
--
he
first,
he
said
he's
been
incarcerated
now
for
less
18
months
in
the
county
jail.
you
said
that's
inaccurate.
and
then
he
says,
“for
over
two
months,
my
nerves
have
been
--
i
couldn't
stand
it
out
there
any
longer.
i
would
like
to
be
tried
by
this
court.”
and
as
--
and
the
question
it
would
seem
to
me
perhaps
of
some
relevance
as
to
the
whole
background
in
this
case,
as
shown
by
this
colloquy
that
this
man
had
been
in
mental
institution
for
16
months,
was
in
for
two
months
in
the
close
quarters,
i
assume
of
the
county
jail,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
close
quarters?
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
but
after
conviction,
he
would
have
been
within
five
days
transferred
to
the
penitentiary
where
at
least
there
is
more
opportunity
for
physical
mobility.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
beg
you
pardon
but
there
is
a
reference.
the
court
here
says
that
under
ohio
law,
he
would
not
get
credit
for
the
two
months
or
the
18
months
--
justice
abe
fortas
there's
been
an
amendment
of
the
statute?
