william
o.
douglas
i've
read
the
other
day
that
they're
making
wonderful
things
out
of
garbage
these
days.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
your
answer
is
that
it's
a
process
claim
not
a
product
claim.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
understand
your
argument
if
i
come
up
with
a
patent
that
the
process
is
a
sudden
mysterious
way
so
as
to
isolate
a
new
either
two
unknown
element,
let's
say
the
atom,
and
that
is
useful
because
it
does
isolate
it,
and
because
the
isolation
is
a
new
end
result
even
though
the
--
there's
no
present
use
or
prospective
use
for
the
particular
element
that
has
been
isolated.
that's
your
argument
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
has
the
patent
office
take
the
position
that
all
processes
that
really
enlarge
scientific
knowledge
are
not
patentable?
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
it
require
commercial,
is
this
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
utility
smacks
commercial
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
not
speaking
of
profit
now.
i'm
just
speaking
of
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
does
--
does
the
patent
office
deny
a
patent
that
merely
enlarges
our
scientific
knowledge,
a
process
that
enlarges
our
scientific
knowledge?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
there's
no
patent.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
no
this
is
a
process.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
no
the
process
shows
you
how,
as
i've
said
to
mr.
laurence,
how
you
identify
this
new
hitherto
to
undiscovered
element
like
the
atom.
justice
william
o.
douglas
whether
of
utilitarian
worth.
