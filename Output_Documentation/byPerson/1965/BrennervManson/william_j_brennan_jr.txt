justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

mr.
bender
is
that
maybe
you
can't
now.yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
bender.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
court
of
appeals
of
district
of
columbia,
which
one
are
you
speaking
of?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
1256,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
this
mr.
bender.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how'd
this
fellow
get
a
patent
if
he's
already
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
only
compound
that
makes
this
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
all
of
them
or
whatever
the
claims
are,
i
gather
bremner's
completion
is
through
all
the
use.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
telling
us
i
gather
is
that
this
problem
of
the
patent
in
the
form
of
his
affidavit
that
is
used
as
a
part
of
it
only
because
you
took
two
claims
out
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
issued
ringold
patent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
what
triggered
this
particular
pursuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
addition
to
that,
to
get
this,
mr.
laurance,
ringold
got
a
patent
on
a
process
to
produce
this
very
compound,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
we
get
this
to
test
the
utility
for
that
compound?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
you're
trying
to
do,
picking
out
to
a
complaint
and
say
no,
whatever
he's
got
belongs
to
me
and
that
includes
any
drug
that
he
gets
out
of
those
assertions
that
that
compound
has
utility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
want
the
benefit
of
this
whole
patent
in
proving
whatever
flows
on
the
assertion
in
this
claim
that
the
compounds
have
a
utility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
statement
about
everyone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
application
claimed
anymore?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
way
of
utility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
you
do
not
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
on
this
issue
of
utility
of
product,
not
of
process,
did
what
ringold
included
in
his
specification
the
utility
of
product,
is
that
why
he
got
the
patent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
mr.
laurence,
i
notice
that
article
pointed
us
out
to
this
earlier
that
i
gather
one
of
these
compounds
has
already
been
shown
to
be
very
effective
tumor
inhibitors.
now,
you
didn't
say
that
in
the
affidavit.
i
gather
because
all
you
had
to
do
--
your
theory
was
all
you
had
to
show
was
that
it
did
have
a
use.
you
didn't
know
whether
it
actually
was
a
tumor
inhibitor
but
you
could
rely
on
the
fact
this
article
had
indicated
that
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
so
that
that's
as
far
as
this
is
probably
at
page
47
was
intended
to
take
you,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
someone
else
has
said
that
it
was
a
tumor
inhibitor
and
for
your
purpose,
your
theory
was
that
was
enough,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
laurence,
am
i
wrong
about
this?
the
examiner
said
your
affidavits
were
inadequate
and
the
review
board,
whatever
this
thing,
agreed,
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
did
not
find
in
your
favor
on
the
basis
that
they
found
your
affidavit
adequate,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
but
adequate
only
on
the
premise
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
have
any
allegation
of
utility.
i
meant
really
i
should've
put
the
question
--
they
didn't
find
they
were
adequate
on
the
premise
that
indeed
you
had
alleged
a
utility
for
the
product,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that?
would
you
show
me
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
is
that
what
you're
suggesting
now
mr.
laurence
is
that
they
said
on
the
premise
that
there
has
to
be
an
allegation
of
utility
of
the
compound
that
is
the
product
of
the
process.
on
that
premise,
you're
saying
the
court
of
customs
of
patent
appeals
said
you
satisfied
that
requirement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
everything
else
is
what,
just
dictum?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
bender,
suppose
it's
not
this
case,
so
i
get
the
government's
argument.
suppose
manson
had
been
first
here
and
his
patent
had
been
denied
a
patent
on
the
ground
that
it
didn't
show
utility
of
the
product.
then
ringold
comes
along
and
he
applies
for
patent.
identical
at
all
these
facts
for
the
application
of
manson
except
that
his
specifications
was
as
they
did
here
alleged
and
say,
the
utility
of
the
product.
now,
manson
would
be
denied,
as
i
understand
it
on
your
view,
a
patent
that
the
court
did
not
allege
utility
of
the
product.
now,
the
question
is,
would
ringold
then
be
denied
on
the
basis
of
prior
art
or
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
neither
of
them
get
a
patent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
this
earlier
case
that
we
heard
argued
this
morning
it's
co-pending
patents,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case,
on
the
hypothetical
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
gets
the
patent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
it
a
pending
--
it's
just
like
the
earlier
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
manson's
application
is
a
co-pending
application.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
mr.
bender,
i
gather
on
that
question
i
put
to
you
earlier,
as
you
said
if
manson
had
published
this
in
an
article
then
that
would've
been
a
prior
art
to
defeat
ringold?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
that
if
it's
merely
a
co-pending
application.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
section
doesn't
apply
because
that
relates
only
to
patents
which
ultimately
issued.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
section
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(e)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
2
(e)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
