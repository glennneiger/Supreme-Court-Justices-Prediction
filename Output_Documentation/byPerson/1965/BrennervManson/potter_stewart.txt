but
last
time,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
just
pointed
out,
eventually
do.
justice
potter
stewart
we've
all
read
about
the
days
when
they
used
to
dump
gasoline
--
as
a
--
as
a
waste
byproduct
when
they
were
making
the
kerosene
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
who
is
to
say
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
anything
that
you
might
mention
that
can
be
very
useful.
justice
potter
stewart
your
thought
is
that
--
that
in
order
to
find
out
or
to
have
any
hope
of
someday
ascertaining
whether
product
a
is
useful,
you
should
not
have
a
patent
on
them.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
bender
that
this
policy
argument
that
you're
now
making,
and
i
understand
that's
what
it
is,
was
implicitly
answered
in
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
to
you
a
moment
ago,
and
that
is
if
a
process
which
does
not
produce
a
useful
product
is
not
patentable
as
you
maintain,
then
all
the
incentive
will
be
to
--
instead
of
applying
for
a
patent
to
keep
the
whole
process
secret
and
that
would
inhibit
i
should
think
further
research
by
others,
competitive
research
by
others
to
find
out
if
the
--
if
the
end
product
is
useful.
justice
potter
stewart
companies
research
--
companies
do
it
all
the
time
as
you
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
have
option.
they
choose
to
keep
the
secret
rather
than
to
apply
for
a
patent.
justice
potter
stewart
they've
done
every
day
and
hundreds
of
times.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
they
proceeded
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
product
was
useless
because
they
--
even
on
that
hypothesis
they
held
that
the
process
patent
was
still
valid.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
so
assuming
this
court
might
agree
--
disagree
with
them
on
the
rule
of
law
should
not
be
responded
have
the
opportunity
of
litigating
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
the
product
was
useful.
justice
potter
stewart
well
do
you
say
you
don't
know
the
answer?
