justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
effect
of
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
sustaining
the
validity
of
a
patent
that's
issued
in
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
it's
not
appealed
then,
not
reviewed
by
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
then
supposed
that
question
to
that
validity
is
raised
when
it
gets
into
the
district
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
so-called
court
does
not
render
binding
judgment
and
cannot
as
to
the
validity
of
a
patent,
can
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
never
get
a
final,
unless
free
on
the
validity
of
a
patent
until
it
goes
to
a
district
court
and
comes
up
to
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
realistically,
the
question
is
whether
the
patent
is
valid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
suppose
that
we
would've
taken
a
case
where
they
held
valid
or
invalid
under
the
procedures
then,
and
we
reversed
it,
would
that
settle
the
controversy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
it
under
the
law
where
it
is
now
written?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
have
a
--
have
a
review
then
of
these
orders
of
the
patent
court
of
customs
and
appeals
when
it
doesn't
settle
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
can't
remove
it,
can
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
particular
case,
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
in
determining
the
validity
of
the
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
patent
wouldn't
be
issued
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
then
the
reason
for
the
government
taking
a
different
view
through
the
years?
has
it?
i
understood
you
said
it
had
been.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
accidentally
discovered
or
did
you
set
out
to
discover
that
particular
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
article
showed
that
it
would
have
a
use?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
field?
i've
heard
so
much
that
may
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
legal
point,
but
i've
got
an
interest
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
hearing
examiner
has
said
that
allegation
was
not
contained,
did
--
was
there
an
amendment
made
to
the
--
for
the
affidavit
or
effort
made
to
do
it
or
did
they
--
your
client
agreed
to
do
it
or
declined
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
one
that
says
was
for
to
be
used
as
a
tumor
inhibitor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
part
to
which
it
referred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
your
position
that
that's
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
quite
have
--
yes,
suppose
--
are
you
saying
that
it's
not
necessary
to
show
or
for
an
action
to
exist
any
utility
at
all
in
the
product
of
a
process
to
which
patent
is
designed?
does
your
case
depend
on
that
point
that
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
product,
as
i
understand
you're
saying,
shown
to
be
able
to
produce
a
product
which
is
no
known
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
possible
utility
that
anybody
can
think
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
it
might
be
known
like
some
object
that
everybody
hopes
that
it
would
be
few
all
in
the
world?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
get
a
patent
even
though
it
has
no
possible
utility
and
might
actually
injurious
to
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
talking
about
the
process
of
producing
this
product
that
nobody
wants
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
everybody's
afraid
of,
dangerous
--
dangerous
to
be
produced.
justice
hugo
l.
black
dangerous
for
it
to
exist.
let's
imagine
one
that
is
dangerous
to
exist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
agreeing
but
i'm
just
asking
if
that
was
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
have
to
get
into
good
morals
any
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
subject
to
one
of
controversy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
general
utility,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
line
you
would
draw.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
now
is
set
on
the
premise
that
it
is
useful,
any
of
them,
any
one
is
useful.
now,
that's
--
that's
a
different
proposition,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course,
if
that's
the
case
and
that
has
been
shown,
i
appear
to
decide
that
that's
wrong
then.
that
would
be
a
question
of
fact,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
in
your
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
also
there
was
a
statement
there
that
it's
useful,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
product,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
asked
you
these
questions
because
i'm
a
little
confused,
it
seems
to
me
you
are,
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
it.
that
you're
undertaking
a
little
more
than
you
need
to
undertake
because
of
the
arguments
you're
making
to
us,
because
you
are
saying
as
i
understand
it
abstractly
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
this
ever
had
a
utility
or
not.
you
didn't
have
to
allege
it
nor
not
to
prove
it
and
yet
you
say,
your
main
argument
has
been
devoted
for
the
fact,
supported
to
some
extent
by
the
record,
i'd
say,
that
this
really
did
show
that
it
was
a
useful
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
didn't
you
leave
that
one
thing
though?
didn't
you
also
point
to
the
fact
that
in
this
affidavit
they
referred
to
a
document
which
had
shown
the
utility
of
the
--
for
the
product?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
add
to
that,
because
i
can't
understand
why
this
case
should
come
all
the
way
up
here
if
you
had
believed
that
this
was
a
useful
product,
you
would've
had
amended
your
pleadings
so
to
call
it,
whatever
they
were
called,
affidavit
here.
why
was
that
not
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
why.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
if
it
gets
down
to
us
now.
you
say
it
is
useful,
they
said
you
didn't
allege
it
was
useful
in
the
language
that
was
clear
enough
to
make
it
and
bring
it
up
into
issue.
that's
what
they
held
on
the
pleading
and
instead
of
amending
it
so
as
to
show
that
it's
useful,
as
i
can
well
see
that
it
might
be
useful,
it
just
stopped
it
and
wouldn't
allege
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
can
there
be
a
useful
process
claim
if
it
produced
something
if
nobody
want
it,
nobody
need
it,
nobody
buy
it
wouldn't
advance
the
cause
of
science,
or
arts
or
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
gets
me
back
to
why
you
didn't
quite
want
to
plead
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
he
have
made
one
on
information
and
belief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
desired
process
but
not
a
desire
to
make
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
--
has
this
been
in
a
dispute
so
that
somebody's
wanted
to
get
decided
the
abstract
question
whether
or
not
you
can
get
a
patent
on
a
process
which
produces
a
thoroughly
useless
product?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
not
a
test
case
to
decide
--
to
get
that
question
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
them
to
present
that
question
in
the
question
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
government
states
the
question
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
connection
of
just
what
you
said,
if
it's
moot
our
usual
course
of
course
is
to
vacate
the
judgment
--
vacate
it
and
remand
it
to
be
dismissed
as
moot,
is
that
what
you
want
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
i
see
the
light
is
on
but
i
want
to
ask
you
this.
on
looking
at
the
record
put
in
the
opinion
of
the
board,
i'm
satisfied
this
time
that
the
board
did
decide
the
abstract
question
which
the
government
raises
and
that's
what
they
based
it
on,
on
the
cases
they've
had
before.
suppose
one
should
be
of
the
opinion
that
they
did
hold,
that
there
had
to
be
no
utility
or
usefulness
to
the
product,
which
is
the
result
of
the
process,
suppose
one
should
believe
that,
and
also
believe
from
the
record
and
from
what
you
said
that
you'd
be
might
be
greatly
injured
if
you
were
not
given
the
chance
to
try
to
prove
the
utility
of
your
product.
what
would
be
the
proper
course
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case
on
the
lower
circuits?
do
you
want
a
chance
to
prove
it
if
in
case
it
would
be
held
that
it
is
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
matter,
it
seems
to
me,
of
great
importance
to
you.
but
if
one
should
be
of
the
opinion
that
there
must
be
some
utility
shown
of
the
product
and
they've
held
now
that
you
didn't
do
it,
didn't
--
they
say
it's
prima
facie
but
if
they
decide
that
on
the
abstract
question
what
would
be
the
proper
disposition?
something
to
send
you
back
to
the
board
or
what?
how
could
your
right
be
protected
in
other
words?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
argue
to
the
board
that
your
product
was
useful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
argued?
do
you
know
whether
or
not
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
did.
