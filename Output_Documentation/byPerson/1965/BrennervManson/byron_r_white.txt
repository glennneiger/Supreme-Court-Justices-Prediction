justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bender,
is
the
board
of
appeals
in
the
patent
office,
say,
under
the
control
of
the
commissioner
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
mean
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can't
go
up
from
there,
can
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he's
part
of
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bender,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
suppose
that
you
could
be
right
and
--
and
manson
could
still
win.
justice
byron
r.
white
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
invent
a
useful
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
did
or
not,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
i
invent
something
except
that
i
don't
know
what
the
use
is
and
i
don't
know
any
use
for
it.
and
the
next
day,
you
invent
the
same
thing
independently
and
you
do
know
a
use
for
it.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
i
don't
know
that
i
did
invent
a
useful
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
shouldn't
i
--
why
shouldn't
i
--
and
--
and
if
we
get
into
a
fight
in
the
patent
office,
why
shouldn't
i
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
you
mean
--
you
mean
the
utility
is
part
of
invent
--
is
part
of
invention?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it's
not,
no
it
isn't,
the
question
--
no
the
questions
is
whether
something
is
useful
--
it
has
to
be
useful
but
i
don't
have
to
invent
it.
i
mean
i
don't
have
to
invent
the
use
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
part
of
invention.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you,
but
the
time
--
but
in
my
example,
by
the
time
it
gets
around
in
the
patent
office
there
is
a
use
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
assume
that
i
thought
of
the
product
the
day
before
but
not
the
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
changed
the
facts
because
i
will
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
doubt
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
will
have
to
find
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
names.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
names.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
get
a
--
but
to
get
a
patent,
ringold
had
to
show
use
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
client
manson
couldn't
cite
an
affidavit
as
--
as
to
that
use
because
he
really
didn't
know
that
was
true,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
couldn't
make
an
affidavit
to
that
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
say,
“i
read
the
article
which
says
so
and
so.”
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
just
given
that
one
away
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
win
the
co-pending
patent
case
automatically
in
justice
brennan's
example,
neither
one
of
them
can
get
a
patent.
