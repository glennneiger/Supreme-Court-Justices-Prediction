mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
two
important
questions
in
the
administration
of
the
patent
system,
one
substantive
and
one
procedural.
the
question
on
the
merits
is
whether
a
patent
may
be
obtained
on
a
process
whose
only
function
is
to
produce
a
useless
product.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
held
that
such
a
process
is
patentable
regardless
of
the
total
lack
of
utility
of
the
sole
product
of
the
process.
that
is
the
court
has
held
that
a
process
to
produce,
for
example,
garbage
or
sewage,
which
has
no
utility
whatsoever,
would
be
a
valid
patent.
it's
also
held
that
a
process
could
produce
some
material
which
just
is
an
in
dirt
lump
of
material,
you
can't
do
anything,
you
don't
know
what
to
do
with
it
would
be
a
patentable
process
because
produces
a
product.
in
our
view
--
mr.
paul
bender
if
you
can
make
wonderful
things
out
of
garbage,
then
that
would
be
a
useful
process.
i
was
using
garbage
as
a
--
a
generic
term
to
things
that
have
no
use.
to
the
extent,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
you
assume
that
everything
is
useful,
then
the
issue
in
this
case
doesn't
arise,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
assumed
that
the
product
of
the
this
process
was
in
fact
useless
and
held
that
nevertheless
the
process
to
produce
the
product
was
a
patentable
useful
process.
now,
this
apparently
is
true
in,
for
example,
the
industry
in
which
this
case
arises,
the
drug
industry
and
chemical
industry,
compounds
that
produce
constantly,
which
have
no
known
utility
and
lots
of
them
never
have
any
utility.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
true.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
true.
well,
our
submission
is
that
if
there
is
any
present
capability
of
utility,
if
you
can
show
that
the
process
is
useful
or
if
you
can
show
that
there
are
some
real
substantial
basis
to
believe
that
it
will
become
useful
--
mr.
paul
bender
that's
true.
you
may
say
hypothetically
that
any
product
may
someday
be
useful.
therefore,
you
might
say
that
any
product
for
example
ought
to
be
patentable.
that
is
not
true.
it
is
conceded
in
this
case
by
the
court
below,
conceded
by
the
respondents
that
used
things
which
are
presently
useless
are
not
patentable
regardless
of
the
speculative
fact
that
someday
they
may
be
useful.
that's
clearly
true
as
the
products
--
it's
clearly
true
as
to
machines.
we
see
no
reason
to
have
a
different
view
as
to
processes.
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
reason
for
that
i
think
is
that
there's
a
lot
of
harm
in
giving
patents
on
presently
useless
things
because
patents
have
a
preclusive
effect.
you
can
use
a
patent
if
you
get
it
to
stop
other
people
from
finding
the
use.
now,
if
you
balance
those
things
together,
it
seems
as
you
clearly
come
out
with
the
judgment
that
it
ought
to
be
not
patentable,
even
though
of
course
there's
a
possibility
that
it
may
be
useful
but
you've
got
to
balance
that
against
the
harm.
in
any
case
--
mr.
paul
bender
right,
just
on
the
hope
that
it
may
be
useful.
you've
got
to
show
more
than
that.
and
that's
been
the
clear
--
that's
been
the
clear
course
of
decision
in
the
patent
office.
that's
what
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
held
in
1950
in
words
which
couldn't
be
any
more
explicit,
and
it's
only
recently
that
they
have
--
that
they
have
retreated
from
that.
before
reaching
the
merits,
however,
if
i
may,
there
is
a
jurisdictional
question
in
this
case,
namely
whether
the
court
has
jurisdiction
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
decisions
such
as
this
one
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
in
patent
and
also
in
trademark
cases.
this
question
was
touched
upon
in
this
court's
decision
three
years
ago
in
glidden
against
zdanok
where
the
court
held
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
an
article
iii
court
exercising
the
judicial
power.
in
that
case,
however,
the
court
explicitly
left
open
the
precise
question
involved
here
that
is
whether
28
u.s.c.
1256,
which
is
the
relevant
jurisdictional
statute,
does
indeed
confer
jurisdiction
on
this
court
to
review
patent
or
trademark
cases
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
we
believe
this
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
glidden
disposed
of
the
constitutional
question,
held
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
be
an
article
iii
court.
the
statute
is
unqualified.
it's
says
all
cases
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
we
believe
that
the
statute
1256
does
confer
jurisdiction
and
that
the
court,
in
fact,
therefore,
can
resolve
the
issue
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
i
would
like
now,
as
i've
said,
to
address
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
question
before
coming
to
the
--
to
the
merits.
so
the
purpose
of
doing
this,
i'd
like
to
give
some
background
in
the
way
patent
office
decisions
are
reviewable
because
i
think
that's
necessary
to
see
the
importance
of
the
jurisdictional
question.
when
a
patent
is
denied
by
the
patent
office,
there
are
two
methods
of
judicial
review
of
that
patent
office
denial,
which
are
provided
by
the
statute.
in
the
first
place,
there's
what's
a
called
a
civil
action.
it
used
to
be
called
an
action
in
equity
against
the
commission
of
patents
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
that's
provided
by
35
u.s.c.
section
145
in
the
patent
act.
the
district
court's
decision
is
of
course
reviewable
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court's
decision
as
i
say
called
a
civil
action.
no
one's
ever
had
any
doubt
that
that
civil
action
is
within
the
judicial
power.
it
is
therefore
reviewable
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
in
turn
clearly
reviewable
and
was
always
been
recognized
to
be
reviewable
by
this
court
on
certiorari.
and
as
our
brief
points
out,
several
of
such
decisions
have
been
reviewed
here
without
noticing
any
difficulty,
and
i
think
there's
no
question
that
that
route
of
review,
district
court
civil
action,
court
of
appeals
review
of
the
district
court
is
reviewable
here
on
certiorari.
the
other
mode
of
review
is
the
one
that's
involved
in
this
case.
if
the
patent's
denied,
instead
of
going
to
the
district
court,
you
can
take
what's
called
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
that's
provided
by
sections
141
to
144
of
the
patent
act
and
also
28
u.s.c.
section
1542.
these
two
routes
are
alternative.
that
is,
each
statute
provides
that
if
you
take
the
other
one,
you
can't
use
the
one
involved
in
the
statute.
you
can't
go
to
the
district
court
if
you've
appealed
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
clearly
provided
to
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
go
to
the
district
court,
that's
in
section
141
of
the
patent
act.
now,
as
i
stated
before,
if
you
go
to
the
district
court,
there's
no
question
that
certiorari
jurisdiction
is
in
this
court
to
review
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals'
reviewing
decision
of
the
district
court.
we
urge
that
the
same
result
should
apply
if
the
route
you
take
is
through
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
now,
that
that
court
has
been
clearly
recognized
to
be
a
court
exercising
the
judicial
power
just
like
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
is.
as
i
say,
the
statute,
if
that's
all
one
looked
to,
is
clear
that
that
would
lead
you
clearly
to
that
result.
it
provides
that
cases
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
may
be
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
by
writ
of
certiorari.
in
addition,
any
policy
reason
you
can
think
of
regarding
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
here,
it
seem
to
us
to
favor
review
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
on
the
same
terms
as
review
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
two
courts
occupies,
i
think
i've
shown,
very
similar
positions
in
the
scheme
of
review
of
the
patent
office,
and,
as
in
fact
happened
in
this
case,
conflicts
of
principle
may
arise
between
them.
you
may
have
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
adopting
one
rule
as
to
patentability.
for
example,
they
have
clearly
accepted
our
position
on
the
merits
of
this
case
and
you
may
have
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
taking
the
opposite
position.
in
that
circumstance,
it
seems
to
us,
that
all
the
policies
of
the
judicial
code
in
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
clearly
favor
giving
this
court
the
ability
to
resolve
that
conflict.
without
it,
you
put
the
patent
office
in
the
terrible
dilemma.
they've
got
one
of
the
courts
to
which
their
decisions
can
be
taken
holding
one
thing,
another
court
holding
another.
the
choice
as
to
which
route
of
review
to
take
is
in
the
patent
applicant
is
unsuccessful.
i
take
it
that
would
coerce
the
patent
office
to
accept
the
rule,
which
is
most
favorable
to
the
patent
applicant
because
if
they
reject
that
rule,
and
accept
the
least
favored
one,
they'll
always
be
reviewed
in
the
court
that
accepts
the
other
rule,
the
more
favorable
one.
and
if
that
court
is
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
as
it
is
in
this
case,
there's
no
review
here
unless
there
is
certiorari
jurisdiction
and
the
patent
office,
as
i
say,
has
put
in
clearly
on
untenable
position.
also,
i
think
you
can
look
to
the
term
of
the
patent
act
here.
there
is
a
great
public
interest
in
eliminating
patents
which
are
in
fact
invalid
even
before
an
infringement
proceeding.
it
can
always
be
even
if
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
erroneously
grants
the
patent,
that
issue
can
later
be
tested
in
an
infringement
proceeding.
but
what
you
have
meanwhile
is
this
patent
which
is
in
fact
invalid
in
existence
and
it
will
obviously
act
to
some
discouragement
to
other
people.
they
may
never
want
to
raise
the
issue.
so
again,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
policy,
the
policy
of
the
patent
act
clearly
militates
in
favor
of
giving
this
court
the
power
to
review
an
erroneous
decision
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
one
would
expect
that
not
too
many
occasions
would
arise
when
a
decision
of
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
will
properly
invoke
the
certiorari
jurisdiction.
it
doesn't
happen
very
often.
this
case
is
quite
rare.
but
when
--
with
the
consistency
of
the
system,
i
should
think
would
call
for
that
jurisdiction's
existence.
now,
as
mr.
justice
harlan's
plurality
opinion
in
the
glidden
case
points
out
however,
despite
the
unqualified
language
of
the
section
and
despite
what
i
think
i've
shown
to
be
the
clear
policies
of
the
judicial
code
favoring
certiorari
jurisdiction,
the
doubts
do
exist
regarding
where
the
section
1256
should
be
read
as
written
to
confer
jurisdiction.
and
i
take
it
that
is
what
led
the
court
to
put
in
the
expressed
disclaimer
in
glidden.
but
we
have
reexamined
these
doubts
and
we
think
that
they
don't
stand
in
the
way.
the
doubts
are
entirely
historical
and
they
flow
entirely
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
postum
cereal
company
case
against
the
california
fig
nut
company
in
272
u.s.
the
case
was
decided
in
1927.
at
that
time,
this
appeal
jurisdiction,
which
is
now
on
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
is,
if
that
time
you
could
either
go
to
the
district
court
for
the
civil
action
or
you
could
go
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeal.
the
difference
is
you
have
a
right
to
make
something
of
a
new
record
in
the
district
court,
whereas
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
appeal,
as
now
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
you've
got
to
use
the
record
made
before
the
patent
office.
now
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
bender
i
mean
the
circuit
court
of
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
this
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
court
was
transferred
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
in
1929,
two
years
after
the
postum
decision.
now,
in
postum,
this
court
held
that
it
had,
this
court,
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
appeal's
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
because
it
deemed
such
decisions
that
is
reviewing
the
patent
office,
in
its
words,
not
a
judicial
judgment
but
a
mere
administrative
decision.
it
viewed
them
and
these
are
again
its
words,
as
merely
an
instruction
to
the
commissioner
of
patent
by
a
court
which
is
made
part
of
the
machinery
of
the
patent
office
for
administrative
purposes.
now,
as
i've
said,
in
1929,
that
jurisdiction,
the
appeal
jurisdiction,
was
transferred
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
and
at
that
time,
in
transferring
the
jurisdiction,
congress
made
no
affirmative
provision
in
the
statutes
for
review
of
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
patent
decisions
here.
there
was
a
provision
for
review
of
the
custom's
decisions
but
not
the
patent
decision.
subsequently,
and
this
is
i
think
what
really
gives
rise
to
the
doubts
which
now
as
i
say
subsequently,
in
1931
and
1940,
in
two
cases
in
denying
certiorari
which
was
attempted
to
be
taken
here
from
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
the
court
denied
certiorari
and
noted
expressly
its
reliance
on
postum
and
on
the
absence
of
any
affirmative
provision
for
review.
now
it
was
in
--
against
this
background
that
the
1948
judicial
code
literally
in
terms
confers
jurisdiction
over
cases,
all
cases
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
insofar
as
the
decisions
after
the
transfer
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
the
decision's
holding
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
insofar
as
they
rely
as
the
first
one
of
them
expressly
relied
in
part
on
the
lack
of
any
affirmative
statutory
provision
for
review,
because
none
did
exist
at
that
time.
the
1948
addition
to
the
statute
providing
for
review
in
terms
would
seem
to
fill
a
void
and
confer
review
here
of
its
own
force
of
decisions
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
1256,
yes.
in
glidden
in
fact,
mr.
justice
harlan's
plurality
opinion,
does
seem
to
indicate
that
it
was
indeed
the
lack
of
affirmative
provision
at
that
time
which
must
have
been
responsible
for
the
court's
decisions
after
the
transfer
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
glidden
held
that
the
postum
decision
must
be
taken
to
be
limited
to
the
statutory
scheme
in
existence
before
the
transfer
of
patent
and
trademark
litigation
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
what
glidden
had
in
mind
was
that
before
the
transfer,
in
fact
just
at
the
time
of
the
postum
case,
this
appeal
to
jurisdiction
was
not
an
alternative
as
i
described
it
before
as
being
now.
that
is,
you
didn't
have
to
choose
between
the
appeal
jurisdiction
and
the
civil
action
jurisdiction.
you
could
take
--
you
could
do
both.
you
could
try
the
appeal.
if
you
lost
then
you
could
come
in
as
civil
action.
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
glidden
pointed
out
that
it
must
have
been
quite
likely
that
feature
of
the
review
at
that
time
which
led
the
court
in
postum
to
hold
that
it
was
merely
advisory,
part
of
the
administrative
process
not
a
judicial
function.
that
was
eliminated.
the
cumulative
effect
was
eliminated
in
1927
shortly
before
the
jurisdiction
was
transferred
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
so
that
when
the
jurisdiction
was
transferred
there,
it
was
an
alternative.
it
wasn't
cumulative.
it
didn't
have
that
administrative
effect
as
glidden
pointed
out.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
therefore,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
decisions
after
that
time,
as
i
say
in
1931
and
1940,
denying
certiorari
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
citing
postum
probably
were
based
upon
at
that
time
the
lack
of
any
affirmative
provision.
if
there
had
been
one,
they
would've
come
out
the
other
way.
one
was
supplied
in
1948
and
there's
no
reason
if
that's
what
the
historical
analysis
is.
there's
no
reason
now
not
to
hear
these
cases,
the
statute
in
‘48
in
fact
conferred
to
jurisdiction,
but
even
if
you
assumed
that,
the
reasons
in
1930
and
1941
after
the
transfer
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
were
constitutional
reasons.
that
the
court
at
that
time
thought
as
the
court
in
postum
thought
despite
the
changes
in
statutory
scheme
that
it
was
not
a
judicial
thing
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
was
doing
and
it
was
not
judicial
jurisdiction.
that
is
no
longer
true.
glidden
clearly
held,
no
question
about
it
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
thus
exercise
article
iii
business
and
that
everything
it
does
is
article
iii
business
and
that
includes
this
appeal
review
of
decisions
of
the
patent
office.
now,
as
justice
harlan's
opinion
stated
all
the
business
of
the
court
is
fully
within
the
category
of
cases
of
controversies.
now,
with
that
constitutional
bar
removed,
even
if
it
did
exist
after
the
transfer
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
i
say
with
the
constitutional
bar
removed,
we
see
no
reason
not
to
read
section
1256
to
mean
what
it
says,
that
is
that
all
court
cases
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
they're
reviewable
here.
this
is,
as
i
say,
consistent
with
the
general
jurisdiction
of
this
court
with
a
general
purpose
to
resolve
conflicts,
with
a
full
conferring
of
jurisdiction
over
the
courts
of
appeals,
for
example,
the
court
of
claims.
to
maintain
the
restriction
that
would
be
wholly
anomalous.
there's
nothing
congress
could
say
now
which
would
be
any
broader
than
what
it
has
already
said
in
the
1948
code.
even
if
there
was
a
constitutional
obstacle
in
'48,
we
think
it's
the
sound
of
you
to
attribute
to
congress
at
that
time
the
purpose
to
confer
on
this
court,
all
the
constitutional
jurisdiction
which
this
court
can
exercise,
that's
what
its
language
said.
so
even
if
there
was
a
constitutional
bar
to
the
exercise
of
the
jurisdiction
then
when
the
bar
was
removed,
we
see
no
reason
now
not
to
say
that
the
jurisdiction
goes
up
to
the
constitutional
limit
which
would
clearly
permit
review
in
these
cases.
now,
we
recognize
that
in
the
past,
united
states
has
in
briefs
in
opposition
in
petitions
attempted
that
we
filed
from
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
submitted
to
the
court
that
no
jurisdiction
did
exist
in
this
court.
now,
that
view
originated
before
glidden
and
zdanok
had
made
it
clear
either
that
postum
was
very
narrowly
based
so
that
there
weren't
any
constitutional
doubts,
no
constitutional
bar
in
any
way.
contemporaneously
with
glidden,
we
said
to
the
court
that
we
thought
the
issue
now
had
become
quite
doubtful.
and
since
glidden
in
briefs
in
opposition,
we
have
submitted
to
the
court
that
the
question
should
be
reexamined
in
light
of
the
doubts
raised
by
glidden.
we,
as
i
say,
reexamined
it
and
i
think
that
i've
shown
that
reexamination
in
light
of
glidden
leads
you
with
some
confidence
to
conclude
that
section
1256
does
indeed
confer
jurisdiction
here
now
in
accordance
with
its
plain
language.
it's
our
understanding
that
respondents
here
agree
generally
with
our
conclusion
that
jurisdiction
exists.
they
seem
to
argue,
however,
that
the
jurisdiction
which
exists
may
only
be
invoked
by
one
party.
that
is
the
patent
applicant.
if
he
happens
to
be
unsuccessful
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
as
he
was
unsuccessful
before
the
patent
office.
but
they
argue
that
the
jurisdiction
may
not
be
invoked
by
the
commissioner
if
his
refusal
to
grant
a
patent
is
overruled
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
we
see
little
sense
in
this
distinction.
no
sense
at
all,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
it
is
also
totally
unjustified
by
the
statute
which
just
these
cases
shall
be
reviewed.
all
of
the
reasons
for
resolving
conflicts,
all
of
the
reasons
for
giving
the
patent
office
a
clear
guide
as
to
what
to
do
would
be
frustrated
if
you
say
that
when
the
commissioner
lost
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
he
couldn't
go
to
the
supreme
court
even
though
the
patent
applicant
could.
again,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
could,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
adopt
a
more
liberal
view
against
the
commissioner
and
there'd
be
no
way
he
could
resolve
this
dispute,
even
though
he
may
very
well
be
right
and
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
was
on
his
side.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
what
control
means
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
the
statute
says
the
commissioner
is
in
charge
of
the
whole
patent
office.
mr.
paul
bender
the
board
of
appeals
is
part
of
the
patent
office.
mr.
paul
bender
no
he
is
part
of
the
board
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
bender
it
would
be
wholly
anomalous
after
they
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
there's
no
question
that
he
cannot
go.
the
statute
provides
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
he's
a
member
of
the
board.
and
i
take
it
the
reason
is
that
he's
not
only
a
member
of
the
board
but
the
board
is
under
his
jurisdiction,
he
is
the
head
of
the
patent
office,
it
would
make
any
sense.
the
only
reason
to
which
they
give
is
indeed
what
mr.
justice
white
just
mentioned.
namely,
that
the
commissioner
is
the
--
cannot
go
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
and
so
they
say
therefore
the
commissioner
shouldn't
be
able
to
go
to
the
supreme
court.
well,
the
reason
the
commissioner
can't
go
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
what
we've
just
said.
it's
his
own
decision.
he
couldn't
challenge
the
decision
he
have
just
rendered,
but
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
can
as
it
has
here
decide
against
him.
and
in
view
of
that,
i
see
no
reason
why
he
shouldn't
then
be
able
to
go
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
mr.
paul
bender
the
effect
of
the
judgment?
mr.
paul
bender
unless
reviewed
--
mr.
paul
bender
it
forces
the
commissioner
to
issue
the
patent.
mr.
paul
bender
that
can
be
reexamined
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
by
people
who
were
not
parties
to
that
decision.
that
is,
in
the
district
court,
that
probably
would
be
an
infringement
action.
mr.
paul
bender
not
on
people
who
aren't
parties
before
it.
and
in
fact,
it
means
that
it's
not
really
binding.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
may
say
this
patent
is
valid.
now,
that
may
bind
the
commissioner
and
thus
to
issue
the
patent
and
the
applicant
of
course
is
in
balance
in
his
favor,
he
gets
the
patent.
but
then
suppose
he
asserts
that
someone
else
who
wasn't
a
party
to
that
decision
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
someone
else
has
infringed
the
patent,
that
someone
else
can
raise
the
invalidity
of
the
patent
because
he
was
not
a
party
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
it
would
be
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
he
wouldn't
get
it
as
opposed
--
as
concerns
other
parties,
but
realistically,
mr.
justice
black,
it
--
mr.
paul
bender
if
this
court
held
the
patent
valid,
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
that
any
district
court
would
hold
the
patent
invalid
after
that
in
an
infringement
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
in
a
practical
matter,
it
would.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
there's
no
compulsive
force
upon
a
district
court
in
a
later
infringement
suit.
that
is
the
force
of
res
judicata
doesn't
compel
it
to
hold
the
patent
valid,
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
to
hold
other
than
this
court
had
held
it
because
this
decision
would
be
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
same
thing
is
true,
mr.
justice
black,
of
the
other
mode
of
direct
review
in
the
patent
office
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
its
decision
holding,
upholding
or
reversing
the
decision
to
grant
the
patent
has
no
more
binding
effect
in
an
infringement
action
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
those
decisions
have
been
reviewed
by
this
court
since
the
--
since
the
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
custom
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
existed
and
the
court
has
never
had
any
difficulty
with
it.
if
those
are,
and
it
seems
clearly
to
be
congress
had
desired
that
they
be,
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
not
to
have
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
and
there
also
as
i
said
before
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
this
policy
reason
concerning
with
the
patent
act
which
supports
that,
because
if
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
adopts
too
liberal
a
view
or
the
court
of
appeals
and
grants
too
many
patents
which
shouldn't
be
granted,
those
patents
is
kind
of
a
clog
on
commerce.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
to
permit
it
to
remove
those.
to
remove
the
principles
of
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes
you
can
remove
it,
surely.
if
you
hold
as
we
want
you
to
hold
in
this
case
that
the
patent
should
not
be
issued
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
in
any
case
where
--
where
we
ask
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
if
your
determination
in
this
court
is
that
the
patent
is
invalid,
it
won't
be
issued,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
so
in
that
sense
it's
far
and
the
only
sense
of
non-finality
applies
when
the
patent
is
issued.
as
i
try
to
say,
that
non-finality
occurs
because
it's
not
fair
to
buy
a
non-party,
there's
no
way
you
can
get
around
with
that.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
it
had.
i
don't
know
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
people
who
took
the
view.
i
think
the
brief
said
that
the
reason
was
the
postum
case
had
held
that
the
jurisdiction
to
review
on
appeal
the
decisions
of
the
patent
office
was
not
judicial.
and
the
briefs
in
opposition
said
that
in
view
of
the
court's
previous
decision
that
the
jurisdiction
is
not
judicial,
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction.
now,
as
i
say
that
reason
was
removed,
that
reason
was
compelled
by
the
postum
case.
that
reason
was
removed
in
glidden
and
zdanok
just
three
years
ago
when
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
constitutional
bar
and
in
fact
it
was
a
judicial
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
exercising.
since
that
time,
we
have
not
said
to
the
court
flatly,
do
not
take
this
issue,
except
we
have
said
to
the
court
that
the
issue
is
a
doubtful
one
and
should
be
resolved
in
an
appropriate
case
where
it
seems
that
there's
also
an
issue
on
the
merits
appropriate
for
resolution.
this
case
is
the
first
one
since
that
time
where
we
believe
that
there
is
a
substantial
issue
on
the
merits
coming
from
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
therefore
we
ask
the
court
to
resolve
it
in
this
case,
since
there
are
too
many
cases
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
which
raise
broad
issues
of
law
which
this
court
ought
to
resolve.
now,
with
the
court's
permission
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
that
is
the
correctness
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
that
i
processed
to
produce
a
useless
substance
is
nevertheless
a
patentable
process.
the
factual
context
out
of
which
the
case
arises
is
quite
complex,
but
i
think
the
relevant
facts
are
fairly
simple
and
i'll
try
to
state
them
as
simply
as
possible.
the
case
involved
an
application
for
patent
on
a
chemical
process
to
produce
a
class
of
organic
compounds
with
what
i
find
to
be
an
unpronounceable
name.
the
name
is
on
page
3
of
the
record
near
the
bottom
in
the
--
in
the
patent
application.
as
i
understand
it
the
class,
the
broad
class
of
compounds
known
as
dihydrotestosterones,
they're
an
organic
compound.
i'll
call
them
“the
compound”,
if
i
may.
respondent
manson
is
the
patent
applicant
for
the
process
to
produce
this
class
of
compounds.
his
affidavit
on
page
33
of
the
record
shows
that
he's
employed
by
the
sterling-winthrop
research
institute,
which
i
assume
is
adjunct
of
the
sterling
drug
company,
and
that
he's
occupied
in
doing
this
very
thing,
producing
new
organic
compounds
and
processes
to
produce
new
organic
compounds.
and
in
fact
he
says
that
he's
produced
about
80
of
them
in
the
last
five
years.
these
things
are
turned
out
with
great
abundance
by
chemical
research
companies.
now,
manson
applied
for
patent
on
his
process,
in
january
1960.
manson,
however,
was
not
the
first
person
to
apply
for
a
patent
on
the
process
to
produce
on
this
particular
process,
the
one
involved
in
this
case,
to
produce
this
compound.
in
fact,
in
1956,
two
other
inventors
whose
names
are
ringold
and
rosenkranz,
applied
for
patent
on
the
same
process
and
that
patent
was
issued
to
them
in
1959
even
before
manson's
application
was
filed.
they
got
a
patent
on
the
very
same
process
to
produce
the
very
same
compounds
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
in
doing
so,
they
did
allege
some
utility
at
that
time
for
their
process
which
is
the
same
process
and
that
can
be
found
on
page
57
of
the
record
where
their
patent
is
set
out.
mr.
paul
bender
yes?
mr.
paul
bender
manson
has
not
gotten
a
patent
yet.
mr.
paul
bender
but
it
is
possible
mr.
justice
brennan
to
get
a
patent
even
though
somebody
else
already
has
a
patent
on
the
very
same
invention.
this
is
called
what's
known
an
interference
proceeding
in
the
patent
law.
the
fact
that
someone
else
already
has
the
patent
on
the
invention
doesn't
necessarily
preclude
you
if
you
can
show
that
you
invented
it
first.
mr.
paul
bender
now,
there
are
some
restrictions
on
that.
i
think
it's
102
(b)
which
says
that
you
got
to
come
in
within
a
year
of
the
issuance
of
his
patent.
if
you
don't
do
that
you
may
waive
your
rights.
but
the
overall
or
general
principle
of
the
patent
law
is
that
the
first
inventor
gets
the
patent,
and
he
gets
it
even
if
the
second
inventor
managed
to
get
a
patent
first.
or
for
example
in
the
co-pending
situation
that
you
just
heard.
they
might
both
be
pending
in
the
patent
office
at
the
same
time.
in
either
case,
the
act
has
a
provision
what's
called
an
interference
proceeding
and
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case.
manson
by
applying
for
a
patent
after
ringold
had
gotten
it
was
really
invoking
an
interference
proceeding
and
which
he
wanted
it
determined
who
invented
the
process
first,
and
that's
never
been
determined
yet.
this
case
has
really
decided
on
the
pleadings.
the
reason
it's
never
been
determined
yet
is
that
the
patent
office
said
that
manson
has
not
made
sufficient
allegations
in
his
application
and
the
affidavits
accompanying
it,
the
affidavits
being
filed
according
to
the
patent
office
procedure.
he
hadn't
made
sufficient
allegations
to
entitle
him
to
the
patent
over
ringold
even
if
everything
in
his
allegations
were
true.
and
the
reason
they
said
that
is
that
they
said
that
manson
has
not
alleged
in
the
affidavit
he
filed
that
the
product
of
the
process
was
useful.
nor
had
he
alleged
that
he
knew
it
was
useful
or
that
it
was
useful
before
ringold
got
--
filed
his
application.
now,
it's
common
ground
that
you
don't
get
a
patentable
invention
unless
it's
a
useful
invention,
although
there's
a
serious
dispute
of
what
useful
means.
they
said,
the
patent
office
said
to
manson,
“you
have
not
sufficiently
alleged
that
your
invention
was
useful
before
ringold's
invention
was
useful,
or
at
the
time
that
you
invented
it,
it
was
useful
that
you
knew
the
use.”
now,
therefore
they
said,
you
have
--
you
can't
show,
since
you
haven't
alleged
that
you
can't
show
that
you
were
the
prior
inventor
of
this
invention
accomplishes
utility.
and
therefore,
they
denied
the
application
and
the
board
of
appeals
affirmed.
now,
manson
had
argued
to
them
two
things.
one,
he
said
“oh,
i
have
alleged
that
the
compound
--
the
product
is
useful.”
they
said,
“that's
not
true.”
they
didn't
deem
his
affidavit
as
sufficient
allegation.
second,
he
said,
“even
if
my
affidavit
doesn't
sufficiently
allege
that
the
compound
is
useful,
that's
not
necessary.
all
i
have
to
allege
is
that
the
process
produces
a
compound.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
what
the
compound
is
for
or
what
it's
not
for,
so
long
as
it's
not
harmful,
positively
evil.
but
you
can
assume
that
the
compound
just
sits
there
and
does
nothing.
it's
just
a
substance
which
clutters
up
the
world.
that
doesn't
matter.”
he
said.
the
process
to
produce
it
is
useful
because
processes
are
something
special.
the
process
is
so
useful
if
they
work,
even
though
they
work
to
produced
something
that
isn't
useful.
those
were
his
twin
arguments.
as
i
say,
the
patent
office
denied
them.on
appeal
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
they
just
addressed
themselves
to
the
second
argument.
they
didn't
go
into
to
the
question
of
whether
he
had
a
sufficiently
alleged
the
use
for
the
product.
they
said,
“you
don't
have
to.”
all
you
have
to
allege
is
what
he
undeniably
did
allege
and
that
is
that
the
process
works
to
produce
the
product.
and
they
said,
“if
you
do
that,
if
you
allege
the
process
works
to
produce
a
product,
then
you've
alleged
enough
to
entitle
you
a
patent
if
you
can
prove
it.”
now,
this
decision
applies
not
only
to
interference
cases,
it
applies
to
all
patent
applications.
and
although
that
manson
came
in
forgetting
about
ringold
with
exactly
the
same
patent
application
just
alleging
that
the
process
worked
to
produce
product
x,
but
saying
nothing
about
what
product
x
could
be
used
for
and
not
used
for.
the
patent
office
said,
“well
you
got
to
say
what
the
use
of
the
product
is.”
this
decision
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
would
hold
that
he
didn't
have
to
say
that.
that
that's
enough
that
he
could
get
a
patent
on
any
of
these
processes
which
he
invents.
mr.
paul
bender
i
understand
it,
it
is
generally
always
been
the
commissioner's
position,
yes.
and
in
fact
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
position
in
1950
in
the
case
called
in
re
bremner
where
the
court
said
it
was
never
intended
that
a
patent
be
granted
upon
a
product
or
a
process
producing
a
product
unless
such
product
be
useful.
this
was
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
in
1950,
and
as
i
understand
that
that
reflect
what
the
commissioner
then
did.
i'm
not
absolutely
sure
of
that,
but
that's
my
understanding.
since
then,
the
commissioner
has
adhered
to
that
and
if
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
which
is
slowly
retreated
from
in
it
in
a
series
of
decisions
which
we
set
out
in
a
long
footnote
in
the
brief
until
they
finally
reached
the
position
they
taken
this
case,
and
that
is
a
process
is
something
different
from
a
product.
they
say
the
bremner
case
is
right
as
to
products.
a
product,
you
can't
get
a
patent
on
a
product
unless
the
product
was
useful.
well,
they
say
that's
not
true
as
to
processes.
with
processes,
it's
enough
to
show
that
the
process
produces
a
product.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
product
was
useful.
now,
we
--
it's
clear
that
no
one
contested
the
fact
that
the
constitution
requires
in
so
many
words,
and
the
patent
act
has
always
required
in
the
same
route
that
a
patentable
invention
be
useful
and
we
simply
don't
believe
that
you
can
say
with
any
reason
or
logic
that
a
process
is
useful
even
though
its
sole
use
is
to
produce
a
product
which
is
entirely
useless.
that
just
doesn't
make
sense.
and
as
i
say,
that
was
the
view
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
clear
in
1950
and
until
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
alright.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
they
seem
to
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
they
certainly
don't
get
them
for
the
products
mr.
justice
harlan,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
this
case
would
give
them
--
to
them
for
the
process.
mr.
paul
bender
the
court
of
--
the
patent
office
would
not
give
it
to
them
for
the
process
unless
they
show
utility
for
the
product,
yes
that's
the
very
issue
that's
involved
here,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened.
they
produce
enumerable
products.
they
can't
get
the
patent
on
the
product
if
it's
useless.
what
they're
now
trying
to
do
is
to
patent
the
process
to
produce
the
product
and
in
that
way
foreclose
access
to
the
--
to
the
product.
they
then
may
never
investigate
the
use
of
the
process.
they
just
get
the
patent
and
use
it
for
a
negative
reason.
now,
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
patent
act,
the
constitutional
purpose
of
the
patent
act,
which
is
--
mr.
paul
bender
then
they
don't
get
a
patent,
your
honor,
but
they're
perfectly
entitled
to
keep
it
a
secret.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
other
people
may
arrive
at
it
independently
mr.
justice
harlan.
this
has
in
fact
happened
in
this
case.
that's
one
--
you
see
that's
one
of
the
great
dangers
of
patent.
if
a
comes
in
and
gets
a
patent
on
something,
he
can
foreclose
b
from
using
it
even
though
b
arrives
at
it
independently
one
day
later.
a
patent
unlike
its
copyright
prevents
somebody
else
from
using
it
even
though
the
second
person
doesn't
copy
it.
it's
a
total
monopoly.
and
so
they
can
keep
it
secret,
but
that
is
no
assurance
that
the
world
won't
learn
about
it
because
other
people,
as
in
fact
happened
in
this
case,
may
arrive
at
it.
in
any
--
that
by
the
way,
mr.
justice
harlan,
seems
to
be
the
principal
reason
set
forth
by
respondents
for
giving
patents
for
these
useless
things.
they
--
they
say,
“well
it's
true
that
they're
useless”
and
they
don't
say,
they
don't
make
the
argument
too
strong
and
if
there's
a
speculative
usefulness
which
may
eventually
come
about.
well
then
you
say
that
it's
the
dissemination
of
information.
you'd
give
us
a
patent
we'd
tell
everybody
about
this
useless
thing
and
then
there'll
be
other
people
will
find
use
of
it.
well,
the
fact
is
that
that's
not
what
patents
are
for.
patents
are
to
give
a
monopoly
to
people
who
will
use
the
monopoly
to
benefit
society.
the
patent
gives
you
a
monopoly
so
that
you
can
guard
and
market
your
product
free
from
competition
for
17
years.
if
you
didn't
have
that,
you
might
never
market
your
product
because
you
might
not
be
able
to
get
financing
from
people
who
wouldn't
invest
in
you.
if
other
people
can
steal
the
thing
as
soon
as
you
hit
the
market
with
it,
your
investment
may
go
down
the
drain.
they
don't
have
all
the
research
expenses
and
the
opening
up
of
the
market
expenses
which
you
have
as
soon
as
you
hit
the
market
they
steal
it
from
you.
it
would
clearly
act
as
a
suppression
of
new
products
being
given
to
society.
there's
that
that
you
suppose
to
use
the
patent
for
and
the
second
thing
you
suppose
--
the
second
way
in
which
you'd
benefit
the
public
is
that
at
the
end
of
the
patent
period,
when
the
17
years
is
up,
the
public
gets
something
useful.
the
patent
isn't
given,
as
mr.
doolittle
said
in
the
previous
case,
to
reward
an
inventor
as
such,
you
do
that
lots
of
other
ways.
you
give
him
scholarships
and
grants
and
things
like
that.
the
patent
is
to
give
the
public
the
benefit
of
the
invention,
and
it's
clear
that
if
the
beneficial
used
to
the
public
that
is
what
useful
means.
that's
what
this
court
has
always
said
in
general
terms
ever
since
the
patent
act
was
enacted.
mr.
paul
bender
and
--
mr.
paul
bender
absolutely.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
the
question
in
this
case
was
whether
he
knew
of
the
use
before
ringold
knew
of
the
use.
and
he
said
--
mr.
paul
bender
oh,
yes.
i
think
it
would
because
it's
the
time
--
time
is
very
important.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
what's
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
oh
no!
i
think
he
should
win,
because
he
--
mr.
paul
bender
oh
surely.
that
--
that's
precisely
the
issue
involved
here,
utility
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
let's
--
let's
change
our
semantics
a
little
bit.
utility
is
part
of
patentability,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
all
i'd
like
to
talk
about.
mr.
paul
bender
alright,
but
i'd
like
to
talk
about
patentability.
you
can't
get
a
patent
without
a
use.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
clear.
suppose
you
invent
a
product,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
paul
bender
right,
but
--
well,
let
me
give
you
an
example
to
which
i
think
illustrates
the
problem
in
a
case
where
there's
not
too
much
controversy.
suppose
you
invent
a
product,
you
know
no
use
for
it,
if
you
apply
for
patent
it
would
be
denied.
mr.
paul
bender
suppose
someone
else
at
the
same
time
was
applying
for
patent
on
the
same
product
but
he
showed
that
it
had
a
use,
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
patent
not
--
mr.
paul
bender
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
patent
because
he
thought
of
the
patentable
invention
before
he
used
it.
you
see,
the
patentable
invention
involves
the
use
also.
take
it
back
one
step
and
i
think
you'll
see
it
more
clearly.
suppose
you
think
of
the
idea
of
producing
--
well
you
remember
the
adams
battery
case
that
you
heard
last
--
last
month
involving
magnesium-cuprous
chloride
battery?
suppose
you
thought
of
the
idea
of
having
magnesium-cuprous
chloride
battery
on
day
one,
right?
you
tried
it
out
on
day
two
and
it
exploded,
as
the
skrivanoff
battery
which
we
cited
as
prior
on
as
alleged
to
have
done.
on
day
three,
your
opponent
thought
of
the
idea
two
days
after
you
did.
when
he
tried
it
out
on
day
four,
he
made
some
little
change
in
the
thing
which
made
it
not
explode.
now,
he's
entitled
to
the
patent,
not
you.
that's
clear,
nobody
would
dispute
that.
if
you
came
in
and
ask
for
a
patent
on
yours
which
exploded,
you
couldn't
get
it
even
though
you
thought
of
the
idea
first.
and
that
it
also
seems
to
me
is
relevant
on
this
other
question
which
is
probably
--
mr.
paul
bender
fine.
this
is
my
facts
that
were
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
if
i
--
i'm
really,
mr.
justice
white,
not
aware
of
how
i've
changed
the
facts
relevantly.
mr.
paul
bender
okay.
this,
the
example
i
just
given,
it
seems
to
me,
is
illustrative
of
the
principle
point
that
i
want
to
make
and
that's
the
patents
aren't
used
and
aren't
properly
used.
it's
never
have
been
used
to
encourage
the
dissemination
of
information,
pure
scientific
ideas
or
techniques.
what
they
are
used
to
was
to
encourage
the
dissemination
of
useful
invention,
because
everyone
concedes
mr.
justice
white
that
that
battery
if
it
exploded
when
you
tried
to
use
it,
wouldn't
be
patentable
even
though
he
was
the
first
one
to
think
of
the
idea
of
combining
magnesium-cuprous
chloride.
and
so
he
could
come
forward
and
say,
as
respondent
say
in
this
case,
“well
give
us
a
patent
on
the
idea.
we
put
it
together,
other
people
may
figure
out
how
to
do
it
without
it
exploding
and
then
it
will
be
a
wonderful
thing.”
but
you
don't
get
a
patent
on
that,
everyone
concedes
that.
a
machine
that
explodes
--
mr.
paul
bender
what?
mr.
paul
bender
i
wouldn't
say
everyone
otherwise.
you
can't
get
a
patent
on
a
machine
that
explodes.
you
can't
get
a
patent
on
a
battery
that
doesn't
work
even
though
you've
got
a
very
noble
idea
which
other
people
may
seize
upon
and
make
into
something
useful.
in
addition,
you
can't
get
a
patent
on
a
product
which
has
no
use,
even
though
if
you
got
the
patent
you
might
say,
the
respondent
say
here,
“well
we
would
publicize
it
and
then
other
people
might
find
the
use
for
our
product.”
there's
no
question
that
you
can't
get
a
patent
on
that
basis
of
the
dissemination
of
information.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
as
i
say
held
that
squarely
in
1950,
it's
consistent
with
everything
that's
ever
been
held
and
they
explicitly
in
this
case
haven't
retreated
from
that.
they
say
it's
the
product.
the
argument
is
right.
you
cannot
get
a
patent
on
a
useless
product
even
though
it's
a
new
product,
and
we
say
the
same
thing
clearly
ought
to
apply
to
useless
processes.
there's
just
no
reason
to
make
something
different
out
of
processes.
i
would
--
finally,
i'd
like
briefly
to
talk
about
the
negative
aspects
of
this
which
i've
mentioned
in
response
to
justice
stewart's
question
before.
it's
not
only
that
the
patent
system
was
never
designed
to
give
patents
to
encourage
the
development
of
useless
things
of
ideas
in
the
abstract.
it's
that
also
that
if
patents
were
given
in
cases
like
this,
they
would
constitute
a
substantial
deterrent
to
pure
research
which
respondents
say
they're
trying
to
encourage.
if
you
let
drug
companies
make
lots
of
these
products,
invent
lots
of
these
processes
without
knowing
any
use
for
it
and
get
patents,
the
only
thing
they're
going
to
do
with
those
if
they
don't
find
the
use
is
to
use
them
to
block
other
people
from
arriving
and
using
the
similar
process
of
product.
they'll
be
used
as
a
way
of
stopping
their
competitors
from
engaging
in
competition
with
them
with
these
processes,
because
the
in
--
the
competitors
may
very
well
find
a
use.
if
you
give
manson
--
if
you
gave
manson,
give
a
patent
in
this
case
on
the
process
which
was
useless,
rosenkranz
and
ringold
who
later
find
the
use
won't
be
able
to
use
their
useful
process
when
they
know
the
use
for
it
without
the
permission
of
the
prior
patentee.
he
can
use
that
patent
to
block
off
their
attempts
to
give
society
something
useful.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
a
possibility,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
don't
dispute
that.
you
may
speculate
that
it
might
inhibit.
personally,
it
seems
to
me,
i'm
doubtful
of
that.
i
doubt
if
people
engaged
in
pure
research
are
going
to
hide
what
they
think
is
technically
scientifically
significant
discoveries,
because
they
can't
get
patents
for
it.
and
i
shoul
think
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
big
companies
market
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
agree.
mr.
paul
bender
but
on
the
other
hand,
there's
also
the
possibility
that
although
they
keep
it
secret,
other
people
will
arrive
at
it,
and
if
you
give
them
the
patent
on
it,
if
other
people
then
do
independently
arrive
at
it
and
arrive
at
it
with
the
use,
the
first
patentee,
the
one
who
has
the
patent
can
stop
them
from
exploiting
it
to
the
public's
benefit.
now,
i
agree
there
are
arguments
on
both
sides.
it
seems
to
me
that
putting
that
light,
the
arguments
clearly
don't
favor
giving
a
patent
because
there
are
all
these
arguments
and
all
these
reasons
why
the
patent
might
act
as
a
depressant
upon
scientific
research.
the
fact
is,
however,
that
you
just
shouldn't
make
the
distinction
between
process
patents
in
this
regards
and
product
patents
in
this
regard.
you
could
make
the
same
arguments
with
regard
to
product
patents.
they're
clearly
not
accepted,
and
i
take
it
the
reason
that
this
balance
has
been
struck
there
in
favor
of
say,
let
them
keep
it
secret.
let
other
people
find
the
product,
and
also
mr.
justice
stewart
by
not
giving
the
patent
at
the
time
when
they
just
find
the
product
to
the
process,
you
encourage
them
to
continue
to
look
for
a
use,
not
to
stop
with
a
product
but
to
go
and
find
out
what
to
do
with
it,
because
it's
only
then
that
they
can
get
the
patent.
now
there,
it
seems
to
me,
you've
got
an
encouragement
which
will
substantially
help
society
by
asking
them
to
look
for
the
use
and
by
not
giving
them
the
patent
and
the
monopoly
until
they
do
get
the
use.
in
some,
the
patent
system
is
designed
to
give
society
things
that
are
useful
to
society
and
you
don't
give
patents
unless
you
have
some
assurance
at
the
time
you
give
some
reason
to
believe
at
the
time
you're
given.
that's
the
thing
you're
giving
a
patent
on
that
will
be
useful
to
society,
otherwise,
you're
just
floating
a
negative
monopoly.
something
that
the
patent
holder
can
use
to
stop
other
people
but
that
he
has
no
incentive
particularly
the
use
to
--
to
give
society
something
especially
in
an
area
like
this
where
he
may
--
his
sole
interest
may
be
in
stopping
his
competitors
since
he
has
a
--
since
he
has
a
related
product.
mr.
paul
bender
on
this
precise
question,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
held
the
way
we
submit
in
a
case
called
petrocarbon
against
watson
several
years
ago.
mr.
paul
bender
process
patent,
yes
and
they
--
and
also
the
bremner
case,
as
i
said
previously
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
held
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
a
process
patent
that
you
can't
get
a
patent
on
a
process
unless
the
product
is
useful.
that
was
held
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
is
the
rule
presently
in
effect
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
it
is
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
which
has
now
departed
from.
so
in
that
sense,
i
think
there
are
decisions
on
this
previous
decision,
two
of
them
going
precisely
our
way,
the
bremner
case
and
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
creates
the
conflict.
there's
no
decision
in
this
court
on
the
issue,
but
in
the
lower
courts,
there
are
these
previous
decisions.
but,
whatever
time
i
have
remaining,
i
will
use
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
a
verbal
matter,
if
you
just
look
at
the
word
useful,
i
suppose
you
could.
mr.
paul
bender
you
could
verbally
say
that
a
process
is
useful
if
it
produces
a
product
but
i
think
--
when
you
interpret
the
constitution,
you
can't
amount
that
way,
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
the
constitution
talks
about
promoting
the
progress
of
useful
arts.
when
you
get
in
that
notion
of
the
progress
of
useful
art,
there
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
just
look
at
the
abstract
question
that
the
process
is
useful
even
though
it's
useful
to
reach
a
product
which
is
a
dead
end.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
because
as
i
say
i
think
it
has
in
mind
the
notion
of
useful
to
society,
beneficially
useful.
mr.
paul
bender
not
if
the
end
result
of
the
process
isn't
useful.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
in
light
of
the
confusion
which
seems
to
exist
of
what
the
issue
is
before
the
court,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
any
question
if
the
court
still
has
on
that.
it's
our
position
that
the
broad
issue
that
is
whether
process
is
useful
simply
because
it
produces
a
product
is
clearly
before
the
court
because
that's
what
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
decided.
they
did
not
decide
these
narrower
questions.
that
is,
they
didn't
decide
whether
the
affidavit
was
properly
rejected
by
the
right
arm
of
the
patent
office
and
they
didn't
decide
whether
the
affidavit
in
fact
properly
alleged
that
the
product
had
utility.
i
don't
know
whether
those
questions
were
presented
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
or
not,
but
surely
the
question
they
did
decide
before
the
court
and
the
court
ought
to
decide
it.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
it
makes
sense
in
terms
of
the
rule
of
law
they
were
adopted
not
to
get
into
these
allegations.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
certainly
he
should
only
have
it
if
he
raised
that
issue
before
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
if
he
did
raise
it,
however,
i
suggest
that
a
remand
probably
may
well
not
be
necessary.
in
our
view,
the
decision
of
the
patent
office
that
there
was
no
sufficient
allegation
of
utility
of
the
product,
it
was
quite
clearly
correct.
the
--
the
journal
article
which
was
mentioned
which
did
suggest
that
there
would
be
tumor
inhibiting
properties
was
not
this
compound.
it
was
a
different
one.
it
was
a
homologue
or
an
analogue,
and
it's
--
and
the
basis
of
the
patent
office
as
a
rejection
of
the
reference
to
the
journal
article
was
that
in
this
area
of
organic
compounds,
very
slight
differences
in
the
compound
can
entirely
change
the
use.
and
it
was
in
light
of
that
that
the
affidavit
stood
and
it
was
in
light
of
that
that
the
patent
office
decided
the
case.
and
i
think
that
was
clearly
correct.
also,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
rule
surely
as
it
then
existed.
now,
i
don't
think
any
meaningful
changes
made,
but
surely
as
the
rule
then
existed
the
board
of
appeals
properly
rejected
the
affidavit.
they
had
that
function.
it
said
that
the
affidavit
had
to
show
prima
facie
priority
and
they
held
since
there
was
no
allegation
of
utility
that
the
product.
it
didn't
show
prima
facie
the
priority.
mr.
paul
bender
that
would
depend
upon
whether
manson
was
in
the
prior
art.
if
manson's
had
been
kept
completely
secret,
as
it
is,
while
it's
pending
in
the
patent
office
and
if
manson
didn't
make
his
invention
public
after
the
rejection,
then
the
process
might
not
be
in
the
prior
art.
the
process
wasn't
in
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
then
--
mr.
paul
bender
then
neither
of
them
would
get
a
patent.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
which,
that
one?
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
understand
which
--
mr.
paul
bender
oh
no!
mr.
paul
bender
because
as
i
said
in
the
--
if
manson's
application
was
denied,
and
manson
did
not
publish
his
findings
because
he
has
no
obligation
to
publish.
i
mean
the
application
for
patent
does
not
constitute
a
public
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
section
of
the
statute
which
deals
with
co-pending
patents
and
which
suggest
that
they're
in
the
prior
art
only
deals
with
co-pending
patents
which
are
ultimately
issued,
and
that
is
our
argument
in
hazeltine,
it
only
applies
to
co-pending
patents
which
are
ultimately
issued.
it
does
not
apply
to
co-pending
patents
which
are
not
ultimately
issued.
the
reason
is
as
in
hazeltine,
we
say,
you
should
look
at
the
law.
as
of
the
time,
the
patents
are
going
to
be
issued
and
if
the
co-pending
one
is
going
to
be
issued
you
shouldn't
issue
another
one
which
is
just
an
insignificant
advance
on,
because
then
you
have
these
overlapping
patents
and
the
public
wouldn't
get
any
benefits
from
the
second
one.
that's
why
the
argument
is
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know.
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
assume
that
can
be
found
in
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
should
think
so.
i
should
undertake
to
send
copies
of
the
briefs
to
the
court
and
file
if
they're
already
in
the
printed
record.
mr.
paul
bender
i
believe
that
they
held
that
on
the
assumption
that
a
--
the
product
was
not
useful,
the
process
was
still
useful.
and
therefore,
if
it
produced
the
product,
and
therefore
there
was
no
need
to
investigate
the
utility
of
the
product
and
that
the
patent
office
had
been
in
error
in
requiring
affidavits
which
swore
to
the
utility
of
the
product.
mr.
paul
bender
well
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it
doesn't
require
commercial
utility.
in
fact,
it's
a
--
mr.
paul
bender
there
some
of
that
element
in
there,
but
they
have
never
--
they
have
never
said
that
the
commercial
that
is
profitable
utility
need
be
shown
at
the
time.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
don't
think
they
require
commercial
utility.
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
that
means.
mr.
paul
bender
if
all
it
does
is
enlarge
scientific
knowledge
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
then
--
it's
right.
i
think
their
position
clearly
as
simply
as
it
you
don't
give
patents
on
knowledge.
you
give
patents
on
useful
dimensions.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
a
process
--
if
you're
asking
me
for
a
patent
on
a
process
and
all
the
process
constitutes
knowledge
then
you
don't
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
the
patent
office's
view
is
that
the
process
is
useful
only
if
it
eventuates
any
useful
product.
mr.
paul
bender
so
far
as
patents
are
concerned,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
unless
ringold
came
in
and
i
think
there's
a
provision
that
if
you
come
in
within
a
year
of
the
publication,
but
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
generally
speaking.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
that's
our
argument
in
hazeltine
and
that's
what
102
(e)
clearly
provides.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
102
(e)
which
is
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it's
(e)
--
mr.
paul
bender
102
(e)
which
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
is
the
co-pending
section
applies
in
terms
only
to
ones
which
are
ultimately
granted.
and
our
argument
at
hazeltine
follows
that
under
103.
