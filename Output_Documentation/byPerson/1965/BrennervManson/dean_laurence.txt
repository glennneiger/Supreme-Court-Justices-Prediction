mr.
dean
laurence
--
questions
and
i
trust
the
same
situation
will
prevail
this
afternoon.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
firstly
to
the
matter
of
the
merits
and
to
straighten
out
some
of
the
situation
with
regard
to
just
what
we
are
arguing
about
here.
firstly,
it
is
clear
that
the
subject
matter
which
is
defined
by
the
claims
of
the
patent
application
of
manson
here
on
appeal
is
a
process.
it's
not
a
product.
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
it
is
only
a
process.
it
is
further
important
to
understand
that
it
is
not
the
first
process
ever
invented
for
making
the
compound,
which
we
will
call
the
two
alpha
compounds
here
that
it
is
supposed
to
make.
this
is
on
the
record
the
second
process
invented
for
making
that
compound.
in
other
words
--
mr.
dean
laurence
it
makes
a
class
of
compounds.
there
is
a
specific
claim
to
the
making
of
one
compound
and
there
is
a
slightly
broader
claim
to
the
making
of
a
narrow
class
of
compounds,
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
for
purposes
--
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
mr.
dean
laurence
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
conceded.
mr.
dean
laurence
i
think,
he
so
stated,
mr.
chief
justice
but
we
do
not
concede
that.
we
simply
do
not
concede
that
the
process
is
useless
and
we
do
not
concede
that
the
product
which
will
be
obtained
if
you
conduct
the
process
is
useless.
and
we
further
say
that
in
this
specific
case,
however,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
it
was.
mr.
dean
laurence
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
black,
there
was
an
article
published
in
a
journal,
antecedent,
anything
that
occurred
here
involving
manson
or
involving
the
ringold
patent
which
we're
trying
to
get
into
interference
with.
before,
either
ringold
patent
it
--
filed
their
patent
application
or
manson
filed
his.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
journal
article
back
in
1956
which
showed
a
way
of
making
the
two
alpha
compound
and
which
described
the
compound
by
identifying
characteristics,
melting
point
and
so
on,
gave
a
structural
formula
whereby
it
could
be
identified
and
said
that
that
compound
was
of
a
class
of
compounds
which
were
being
tested
as
tumor
inhibitors
and
some
members
of
the
class
had
already
been
tested
and
found
to
be
useful
for
that
purpose.
that's
at
record
61.
the
court
will
refer
to
record
61.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
that
is
why
we
say
--
mr.
dean
laurence
it
very
definitely
has
something
to
do
with
the
legal
point,
mr.
justice
black.
if
i
may
read
from
page
61,
the
last
sentence
of
the
ringold,
et
al.
article
is
this.
after
having
described,
the
very
compound
produced
by
the
process
here
in
issue,
but
by
a
different
process,
the
article
says,
“while
anti-tumor
screening
of
the
above
described
2-methyl
hormones
is
still
in
progress,
1a
and
2a
which
are
other
members
of
this
class
of
hormones
to
which
the
2-methyl
hormones
belong
have
already
been
shown
to
be
very
effective
tumor
inhibitors.
now,
that
is
the
starting
point,
the
takeoff
in
this
case.
there
was
a
journal
article,
and
in
that
journal
article,
it
told
us
a
way
of
making
the
compound
which
the
process
here
in
issue
makes.
so
we
have
an
alternative
and
second
way
of
making
the
compounds
described
in
that
journal
article.
now,
after
the
journal
article
was
published,
ringold
filed
a
patent
application
and
got
a
patent,
and
they
claimed
a
different
process
from
that
of
the
journal
article
involving
only
one-step
method.
the
first,
the
journal
article
shows
about
i
think
a
three
or
four-step
method.
after
ringold
got
his
patent,
manson
filed
an
application,
timely,
there's
been
no
argument
about
that
and
in
full
compliance
with
all
of
the
rules
of
practice
and
the
statutes
relating
to
the
proper
filing
of
an
application,
copied
a
claim,
two
claims
out
of
the
ringold
patent,
the
process
claims
which
are
here
in
issue.
and
said,
“i
think
i
invented
that
process,
that
single
step
process
not
the
process
of
the
article
but
the
single
step
process
before
ringold,
the
patentee,
invented
it
and
i
want
a
chance
to
contest
priority.”
and
when
that
occurs,
the
patent
office
rules
provide
rule
204
(b)
as
it
then
stood
provided
that
one
must
file
an
affidavit
which
makes
a
prima
facie
case
of
having
invented
the
subject
matter.
that
is
when
you
copy
a
claim
out
of
a
patent
application,
out
of
an
issued
patent,
you
must
file
this
kind
of
affidavit
that
shows
on
its
face
that
you
completed
the
invention
of
the
subject
matter
defined
by
the
claim
before
the
filing
date
of
the
patentee.
otherwise,
if
you
couldn't
make
such
an
affidavit
it
would
be
nonsense
to
have
any
interference
because
you
couldn't
back
of
his
filing
date.
manson
here
filed
such
affidavits,
and
that
is
all
what
this
case
is
about.
whether
the
affidavits
he
filed
were
sufficient
under
patent
office
rule
204
(b).
and
now
i
have
to
tell
the
court
that
rule
204
(b)
was
amended
after
this
case
was
decided
to
bring
it
into
conformity
with
the
point
that
we
are
going
to
make
in
this
case
that
the
affidavits
could
not
be
judged,
their
sufficiency
could
not
be
adjudged
by
a
primary
examiner.
mr.
dean
laurence
a
primary
examiner.
and
at
this
point,
let
me
very
quickly
describe,
because
i
think
mr.
justice
white
asked
a
question
whether
board
of
appeals
was
under
control
of
the
commissioner.
let's
look
at
the
patent
office
for
a
moment.
we
have
--
when
an
application
is
filed,
a
group
of
people
called
examiners
and
there
is
of
course
in
the
hierarchy
a
primary
examiner.
now,
the
primary
examiner
and
all
of
his
helpers
are
arms
of
the
commissioner.
the
commissioner
is
charged
with
examining
the
patent.
so
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
here,
a
primary
examiner
is
the
commissioner.
now,
if
the
examiner
by
the
commissioner
says,
“i
won't
allow
that
patent
for
any
reason
at
all
because
it's
not
in
compliance
with
the
section
112
which
says
you
must
fully
describe
how
to
make
and
how
to
use
the
claimed
invention.”
or
any
other
reason,
then
the
applicant
has
recourse
to
a
board
of
appeals.
now
the
board
of
appeals
is
not
under
the
control
of
the
commissioner.
the
board
of
appeals
is
a
separate
body.
the
members
of
the
board
are
nominated
by
the
president
confirmed
of
the
vice
senator
of
senate
and
they
sit
as
a
board.
the
commissioner
of
patents
is
a
member
of
the
board
of
appeals
but
he
does
not
control
the
board
of
appeals
and
cannot
reverse
a
decision
of
the
board
of
appeals.
insofar
as
i'm
aware,
it's
never
been
done.
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
done.
mr.
dean
laurence
there
are
i
think
currently
nine
members,
a
sit
in
banks
of
three
and
from
time
to
time
other
people
are
appointed
when
they
get
a
heavy
case
load
to
the
statutes
provide
that
they
may
be,
but
it's
a
--
mr.
dean
laurence
the
whole
staff
is
i
think
on
the
order,
examining
core,
is
on
the
order
of
1100.
there
is
of
course
a
big
administrating
clerical
staff.
i
do
not
know
the
number
of
those
people.
mr.
dean
laurence
a
month?
currently
the
load
is
about
800
to
1200.
it
varies
in
that
range.
the
reason
for
it
is
of
course
the
fee
bill,
has
made
everybody
pay
up
their
fees
to
get
their
patens
out.
normally,
i
think
the
number
of
patents
issued
for
a
week
in
the
whole
category
of
arts
is
something
like
700.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes.
mr.
dean
laurence
it's
a
little
higher
because
we
have
a
surge
in
the
office
right
now
due
to
the
--
there
was
--
you
had
to
pay
your
fees
before
a
certain
time
in
order
to
avoid
a
higher
fee.
mr.
dean
laurence
about
two-and-one-half
times,
that
number
of
applications
are
filed.
it
takes
roughly
two
and
one
half
applications
to
get
a
patent.
in
other
words,
a
patent
always
knocks
down
about
one-and-a-half
and
they
led
through
about
one.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes.
mr.
dean
laurence
i
think
is
about
correct,
your
honor,
those
statistics
are
available
in
senate
reports.
now,
the
primary
examiner
decided
the
affidavits
were
insufficient,
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about
on
the
merits
in
this
case
is
whether
those
little
old
rule
204
(b)
affidavits
were
sufficient.
the
primary
examiner
decided
the
affidavits
were
insufficient
only
because,
and
i
quote
record
48
and
50,
“no
utility
for
the
final
product
produced
by
the
process
is
alleged
in
the
affidavits.”
now,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
right
at
this
point,
this
is
not
a
section
112
case.
section
112
has
to
do
with
what
you
put
in
your
patent
application
when
you
file
it.
this
case
has
only
to
do
with
a
rule
204
(b)
affidavit,
and
when
the
examiner
said
at
that
point,
“no
utility
for
the
final
product
produced
by
the
process
is
alleged,”
he
meant
alleged
in
the
affidavits.
there
didn't
have
to
be
a
utility
of
any
sort
alleged
in
the
patent
specification,
and
there
wasn't
and
the
examiner
specifically
ruled
on
that
point
saying
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
manson
argued
the
prime
--
yes?
mr.
dean
laurence
issued
ringold
patent.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
correct
your
honor.
keep
in
mind
that
the
process
here
involved
is
already
patented.
we
aren't
up
here
asking
that
this
court
determine
whether
the
subject
matter
is
patentable.
that
isn't
an
issue
here
at
all.
it's
already
been
patented
to
ringold.
what
manson
sought
and
what
the
ccpa
granted
him
was
the
right
to
contest
priority
to
see
who
first
invented
the
patented
process.
in
other
words,
can
manson
take
it
away
from
ringold,
et
al.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
clark,
simply
because
he's
not
involved
until
the
patent
office
says
there
is
an
interference.
mr.
dean
laurence
ringold,
in
filing
his
application
did
not
have
to
show
use
because
the
compound
was
already
known,
but
he
did
in
fact
show
a
use
for
the
product
made
by
the
process
which
is
patented.
mr.
dean
laurence
mr.
justice
black,
there
are
five
affidavits
in
this
case
and
the
last
one
is
at
record
47.
in
that
specific
affidavit,
what
was
said
was
this.
that
prior,
i'm
reading
from
the
bottom
of
record
47.
prior
to
december
16,
1957,
that's
the
filing
date
of
ringold,
the
utility
of
the
process
of
claim
three
of
my
application
was
obvious
to
me
--
that's
a
claimed
copy
out
of
the
patent
--
was
obvious
to
me
and
that
it
would
produce,
what
i
call
a
two
alpha
compound
here,
the
utility
of
which
as
a
hormone
analogue
was
described
in
the
article
by
ringold
which
is
the
early
journal
article.
now,
in
other
words,
what
the
applicant
here
said
--
mr.
dean
laurence
the
article
said
that.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes.
the
utility
of
which
is
a
hormone
analogue
that
is
as
a
tumor
inhibitor.
now,
we
say
that
when
manson
averred
that
the
process
of
the
claim
was
obvious
that
it
would
produce
what
it
was
supposed
to,
the
two
alpha
compound,
and
then
that
the
utility
of
that
thing
which
was
produced,
but
is
not
here
claimed
was
obvious
to
him,
he
made
a
prima
facie
case
and
that's
all
that's
required
by
the
rule
under
viable
precedents
which
have
not
been
overruled.
and
which
are
found
at
record
45
--
at
page
45
of
respondent's
brief
which
hold
that
an
invention
may
be
completed
and
the
thing
which
is
made
--
made
its
utility
may
be
so
obvious
that
no
test
is
necessary.
now,
there
is
a
class
of
cases
in
which
the
courts
are
or
several
of
the
lower
courts
has
so
held
that
you
can
complete
an
invention.
and
mind
you,
rule
204
(b)
is
designed
to
inquire
into
whether
an
applicant
completed
his
invention,
i.e.
conceived
and
reduced
to
practice
prior
to
the
filing
date
of
the
patentee
from
whom
he
seeks
to
take
claims.
so
here,
we
say
that
under
the
viable
precedence
of
the
cases
which
we
cite
at
page
45
of
our
brief,
manson
did
in
fact
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
because
all
he
had
to
say
was
that
the
utility
of
this
process
was
obvious
to
him
and
that
it
would
make
a
known
product.
mr.
dean
laurence
it
is
our
position
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
dean
laurence
our
case
does
not
depend
on
this
court
going
that
far,
but
we
say
if
the
court
should
decide
to
go
that
far,
then
a
claim
directed
to
a
chemical
process
which
is
shown
to
be
operative
and
a
full
disclosure
given
of
how
to
make
a
particular
product
and
that
product
is
known
in
the
art,
it's
all
in
the
art
per
se,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
any
utility
be
known
for
it
or
not,
that
the
utility
of
the
process
is
proven
and
established
when
the
process
is
conducted
by
the
chemist
and
shown
to
produce
the
thing
it
is
supposed
to
produce
--
mr.
dean
laurence
known.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
product
must
be
known
in
the
art.
the
product
per
se
must
be
known.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
entirely
possible,
but
the
cold
fact
--
mr.
dean
laurence
the
cold
--
mr.
dean
laurence
we
couldn't
get
a
patent
on
the
product,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
laurence
dangerous
to
produce?
mr.
dean
laurence
in
that
case
your
honor
i
think
it
would
be
quite
contrary
to
what
mr.
justice
story
said
in
bedford
v.
hunt,
it
would
be
there
contrary
to
good
morals
mischievous
or
wholly
undesirable
then
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
black
that
there
could
be
no
question
in
such
a
process.
mr.
dean
laurence
oh,
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
say
no.
if
you
have
something
which
was
something
to
good
morals,
mr.
justice
story
i
think
would
--
mr.
dean
laurence
no,
i
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
get
into
that
but
as
mr.
justice
story
did
--
mr.
dean
laurence
he
said,
“injurious
to
the
morals,
the
health
of
the
good
order
of
society.”
if
it's
any
of
those,
then
it
is
not
patentable,
otherwise
it
is
not
necessary
to
establish
the
invention
is
of
such
general
utility
as
to
supersede
other
inventions
now
in
practice
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose.
it
is
--
mr.
dean
laurence
right.
and
the
justice
went
on
to
say,
it
is
sufficient
that
it
has
no
obnoxious
or
mischievous
tendency
that
makes
it
sufficient.
mr.
dean
laurence
that's
a
line
i
would
draw,
your
honor,
and
here
is
why.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
one
can
name
a
chemical
compound.
we're
not
dealing
with
sort
of
amorphous
masses
here.
we're
dealing
with
chemical
compounds
which
are
things
which
have
definite
fixed
structures
known
to
chemist.
no
one
can
name
a
chemical
compound
which
is
not
useful
because
any
chemical
compound
can
be
used
by
a
chemist
by
obvious
reactions
to
make
something
else.
it
is
useful
per
se,
any
organic
chemical
compound.
there
are
type
reactions
known
in
organic
chemistry.
if
the
thing
is
an
alcohol
it
is
known
that
it
can
be
esterified
with
an
acid
to
make
an
ester
so
you
can
make
an
ester
from
it,
it
is
a
research
tool.
every
org
--
mr.
dean
laurence
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
process
which
makes
an
organic
compound
and
i
have
asserted
that
any
organic
compound
is
useful
because
something
else
can
be
made
from
it.
mr.
dean
laurence
in
a
specific
case,
yes.
mr.
dean
laurence
in
our
case,
we
are
not
dependent
upon
that,
because
here,
our
compound,
i
should
not
use
the
expression,
our
compound.
the
compound
produced
by
the
process
was
known
to
be
of
a
class
of
compounds
where
a
utility
was
set
forth
in
a
prior
publication.
mr.
dean
laurence
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
dean
laurence
well,
he
asserted
the
utility
in
his
specification
and
that's
all
its
necessary.
mr.
dean
laurence
i'm
saying
his
process
belongs
to
manson,
because
manson,
we
think,
was
earlier
and
we
want
a
chance
to
prove
that.
mr.
dean
laurence
there
is
no
assertion
in
the
claims
that
the
compound
had
a
utility.
the
claims
themselves
define
merely
a
process.
there
is
an
assertion
in
the
specification.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
--
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
not
quite
accurate,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
do
not
want
to
leave
you
with
--
mr.
dean
laurence
i
do
not
want
to
leave
you
with
a
misapprehension.
we
do
not
seek
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
any
use
disclosed
in
the
ringold,
et
al.
patent.
we
do
seek
to
get
the
benefit
for
manson
of
the
use
disclosed
--
the
utility
disclosed
in
the
prior
journal
article
which
was
ahead
of
the
filing
date
of
the
ringold
patent.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
that.
that
was
in
the
entire
art.
mr.
dean
laurence
anymore?
mr.
dean
laurence
the
specifications
defined
other
utilities
perhaps
more
specific.
we're
dealing
in
the
field
of
hormonal,
which
means
that
affects
the
endocrine
glands,
and
there
they
can
be
androgenic
or
estrogenic
and
the
specification
of
the
ringold,
et
al.
patent
did
go
farther
than.
mr.
dean
laurence
we
do
not
claim.
the
claims
here
are
concerned
in
no
way
with
a
product
or
with
any
particular
use
of
a
product.
mr.
dean
laurence
no,
your
honor.
he
got
the
patent
because
the
process
sufficiently
creatively
ingenious,
vis-à-vis,
the
prior
art
the
examiner
thought
it
was
patentable
subject
matter.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
the
product
was
useful.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
but
he
did
not
claim
the
product.
mr.
dean
laurence
i
have
gone
beyond
the
facts
necessary
to
decide
this
case
in
arguing
of
the
point
because
it
was
my
understanding
the
court
raised
the
question
of
how
i
would
feel,
or
how
i
would
argue
in
the
event
that.
and
so
i
went
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
decide
this
case.
we
feel
that
all
it's
necessary
to
decide
this
case
on
the
merits
question
would
be
just
this.
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
affidavit
and
observe
that
it
avers
the
process
had
in
fact
been
conducted
and
the
compound
made,
and
that's
uncontroverted.
and
then,
that
the
utility
of
the
product
was
obvious
to
manson
and
that
under
applicable
case
precedence
which
are
still
viable,
that
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
priority
that
would
indicate
--
mr.
dean
laurence
we
could
fall
back
upon
that,
your
honor.
if
we
had
to
fall
back
beyond
what
i
have
said,
we
could
go
on
and
say
yes.
in
the
journal
article,
there
was
a
utility
showing
for
the
compound.
mr.
dean
laurence
we
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
submit
he
did.
at
record
47,
the
last
allegation
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
beginning
from
line
four
from
the
bottom
of
record
47,
where
manson
averred
that
prior
to
this
filing
date
of
ringold,
the
utility
of
the
process
of
claim
three,
that's
the
copied
claim,
was
obvious
to
me
and
that
it
would
produce
the
two
alpha
compounds.
and
then
it
goes
on.
the
utility
of
which
compound
as
a
hormone
analogue
was
described
in
the
ringold
article,
and
i
say
that
that
is
not
the
same
ringold
patentee,
that's
the
journal
article
i've
been
mentioning,
and
that
was
obvious
to
me.
and
he
had
previously
said,
if
you'll
refer
to
record
46,
about
the
middle
of
the
page
just
above
the
type
signature
of
andrew
john
manson,
ringold
--
i'm
sorry,
manson
averred
that
prior
to
that
same
date,
december
16,
'57,
“i
had
read
the
article
by
ringold.”
so
that
he
was
in
possession
of
the
knowledge
of
the
--
of
the
journal
article
and
he
had
made
the
necessary
averment.
mr.
dean
laurence
mr.
justice
fortas,
let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify
it.
firstly,
the
manson
article
described
the
process
not
here
in
issue.
it
described
a
product
which
is
the
same
as
that
made
by
the
process
here
in
issue.
that
product
was
a
member
of
a
class
of
compounds
which
the
journal
article
described
as
having
certain
utilities.
what
manson
was
required
to
aver
in
his
affidavit
was
that
the
process
which
he
had
invented
and
copied
the
claims
from
the
ringold
patent
had
a
utility.
the
process
with
what
he
was
claiming
and
he
had
to
make
his
affidavit
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
which
he
claimed
it
was
of
the
statutory
class
of
subject
matter
known
as
processes.
it
was
not
the
composition
of
the
matter
or
the
article,
no.
when
he
made
his
affidavit,
he
had
to
make
an
averment,
“i
aver
that
the
utility
of
what
i
invented,
the
process
is
useful.”
and
that
is
why
he
said,
“my
process
was
useful
because
it
would
make
the
desired
product.”
now
--
mr.
dean
laurence
the
product.
mr.
dean
laurence
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
laurence
there
were
five
affidavits
filed
and
i
think
that
represented
a
conscious
effort
on
the
part
of
the
patent
agent
who
prosecuted
the
application
to
comply.
and
you
say
why
this
case
came
all
the
way
up
here
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dean
laurence
we
didn't
bring
it
here.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
the
simple
answer
that
we
give.
there
is
a
further
answer
procedurally.
mr.
dean
laurence
the
thought
that
the
product
is
something
no
one
wanted
is
quite
contrary
to
the
record,
i
submit,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dean
laurence
it
seems
to
us
that
it
was
pleaded
but
procedurally,
let
me
explain
how
this
occurs.
the
examiner,
acting
for
the
commissioner,
looks
over
a
patent
application
and
after
he
rejects
the
application
the
record
is
completed.
now,
in
case
that
as
finally
rejects
it,
now
in
case
that
the
applicant
wants
to
--
he
can
try
to
put
in
some
more
affidavits
at
that
point
and
that
was
done
here,
then
it
goes
to
the
board
of
appeals.
now,
once
the
board
of
appeals
has
made
its
decision
which
is
the
portion
from
which
mr.
justice
fortas
was
reading,
there
can
be
no
further
change
made
in
the
record.
it
goes
at
that
point
to
the
courts
--
to
the
ccpa
on
the
record
as
is
made.
there
can
--
after
you
hear
what
the
board
of
appeals
had
to
say
and
after
it
doesn't
have
the
chance
to
go
back
and
fix
up
his
record
in
order
to
accord.
mr.
dean
laurence
we
think
so.
mr.
dean
laurence
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
dean
laurence
correct,
your
honor
and
were
at
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dean
laurence
he
had
not
--
we
concede
that
he
had
not
made
any
test
of
the
compound
as
--
mr.
dean
laurence
he
could
not
do
more
than
say
--
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
dean
laurence
that,
we
submit,
is
what
he
did
when
he
said
that
since
the
article
has
been
published
and
reflects
this,
we
think
that
the
use
of
the
compound
would
be
obvious
in
view
of
what's
in
the
publication.
it
was
obvious
to
us
that
it
would
have
that
result.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
my
argument
in
its
broadest
sense
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
i
would
put
it
this
way.
you
recall
that
in
corona
v.
dovan,
this
court
said,
“the
criterion
as
to
processes
and
their
reduction
to
practice,
which
means
completion
of
the
invention.
a
process
is
reduced
to
practice
when
it
is
successfully
performed.”
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
having
to
go
on
and
determine
some
utility
for
what's
made,
and
coming
now
to
this
specific
point
made
by
you
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
court
below
said
clearly,
a
process
which
operates
as
disclosed
to
produce
a
known
product
is
useful
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
now,
how
can
it
be
said
the
contribution
to
the
store
of
chemical
knowledge
of
a
second
process,
as
we
have
here,
second
process
in
the
art
for
making
a
known
compound
does
not
add
to
our
useful
knowledge
and
contribute
to
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts.
how
can
it
be
said
that
it
doesn't?
it
adds
something
to
our
knowledge
of
chemical
processing
which
is
very
desirable.
mr.
dean
laurence
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
i
still
have
not
made
it
clear
that
the
process
of
the
article
and
the
process
of
the
claims
here
involved
are
two
different
processes
for
making
the
same
identical
thing,
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
i
think
that
arises
in
this
context.
the
process
of
the
claims
here
in
issue
makes
a
compound
disposed
as
being
made
by
another
process
in
the
journal
article
and
that
is
not
disputed.
what
is
raising
the
question,
i
believe
is
this.
that
the
compounds
which
were
tested
and
reported
upon
in
the
journal
article
are
what
we
call
homologues,
next
to
adjacent
homologues
of
the
compound
made
by
the
process
here
in
issue.
the
--
and
those
compounds
were
reported
as
being
effective
tumor
inhibitors
in
certain
screening
tests,
and
the
compound
of
the
exact
process
here
in
issue
was
in
the
progress
of
being
tested
at
that
time.
so
that
we
had
a
classic
compound
some
members
of
which
had
been
tested
and
some
had
not.
mr.
dean
laurence
if
it
be
said
that
it's
necessary
to
make
a
claim
for
the
utility
of
the
product
made
by
the
process.
we
were
in
a
position
to
make
a
claim
for
the
utility
of
the
process
and
that
it
would
produce
a
desired
product.
mr.
dean
laurence
the
fact
that
money
was
being
spent
on
the
process
indicates
that
there
were
some
desirability
both
in
the
process
and
what
it
would
make.
mr.
dean
laurence
i'm
not
aware
that
it
has,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dean
laurence
i'm
not
aware
that
that
abstract
question
is
presented.
mr.
dean
laurence
it
certainly
is
not.
we
have
no
desire
to
be
in
this
court
on
this
case.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
takes
us
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
think
that
the
question
presented
by
the
government
is
not
properly
brought
on
the
record
before
this
court.
mr.
dean
laurence
the
court
--
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you're
saying
the
court
below
held
that
a
process
which
operates
to
produce
a
known
product
is
useful.
and
that
is
what
the
court
below
did
hold
in
fact.
mr.
dean
laurence
because
the
government
record
--
the
government
says
even
though
the
product
is
known
and
known
to
be
a
member
of
a
class
of
compounds
having
an
established
utility,
still
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
dean
laurence
no,
in
the
question
presented
--
mr.
dean
laurence
correct,
the
government
fails
to
state
the
question.
mr.
dean
laurence
the
question
as
stated
by
the
government,
we
submit,
is
not
before
you
because
they
have
omitted
the
word
known
before
product
on
page
2
of
their
brief
in
stating
their
question.
and
in
any
event,
if
the
utility
can
be
alleged
under
a
rule
204
(b)
affidavit
to
be
obvious,
that
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
dean
laurence
correct.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes.
mr.
dean
laurence
the
court
held
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
allege
in
the
affidavit
that
he
utility
was
obvious
to
the
applicant
and
that
we
have
so
done
and
that
made
our
affidavit
sufficient
then
the
court
went
beyond
that
and
--
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
in
--
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
when
they
discussed
in
re
dickinson
and
zenith
which
was
a
predecessor
case.
mr.
dean
laurence
record
page
65
and
the
court
will
find
it
necessary
to
refer
to
dickinson
and
zenith
in
reviewing
on
this
point.
in
the
dickinson
and
zenith
case
which
they
quote
from
at
length
here,
the
board
said
--
sorry
the
court
said
that
the
question
of
the
operability
and
the
statement
that
such
utility
was
obvious.
i'm
reading
now
from
the
bottom
of
page
66.
it
is
our
opinion
that
if
the
requirement
of
a
prima
facie
showing
of
utility
of
a
claimed
compound,
and
that
was
in
the
dickinson
and
zenith
case,
by
the
way
there
was
a
compound
involved,
may
be
satisfied
by
the
statement
that
such
utility
was
obvious
at
the
time
the
invention
was
made
than
a
fortiori
the
requirement,
half
of
page
67,
is
satisfied
where
no
question
is
raised
as
to
the
operability
of
the
claimed
chemical
process
to
produce
a
known
compound.
so
there,
they
decided
this
question
which
we
think
is
the
only
question
in
this
case,
the
completeness
of
the
rule
--
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
dean
laurence
it's
--
it
would
be
dictum.
the
statement
to
the
effect
that
it
clearly
a
process
which
operates
to
produce
a
known
product
is
useful
without
going
any
further
would
be
dictum.
mr.
dean
laurence
that
was
the
statement
of
the
issue
by
the
court
below.
i
have
only
a
few
moments
and
i
do
want
to
touch
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
i
regret
that
i've
gotten
to
that
before.
we
say
--
we
do
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
this
court
now
has
clearly
the
jurisdiction
to
review
cases
coming
on
from
the
lower
court
where
they
originated
in
the
patent
office
board
of
appeals,
but
we
say
that
that
is
true
only
when
the
appellant
losses
below
and
not
when
the
commissioner
is
reversed
below.
and
i
will
try
to
boil
this
down
into
five
minutes.
we
have
to
go
back
to
1839
and
remember
that
from
that
time
on,
there
have
been
alternative
routes
provided
for
review
of
an
adverse
decision
by
the
commissioner
of
patents
on
a
patent
application.
the
alternative
routes
have
taken
various
forms.
they've
gone
through
chief
justice
of
the
old
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
of
columbia
from
1839
to
1852.
they
went
through
the
old
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
there
was
a
court
called
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
a
while.
and
all
of
this
time,
there
was
the
one
alternative
route
which
went
up
and
was
cumulative
between
1839
and
1927
in
this
respect,
and
a
defeated
applicant
could
elect
to
go
one
way.
and
when
he
got
beaten
up
there,
he
could
come
back
and
have
his
bill
in
equity
remedy
all
the
way
through
and
take
the
normal
course
of
a
bill
in
equity.
however,
between
those
years
of
1836
to
1948,
the
commissioner
never
had
any
right
by
statute
to
go
any
further
if
the
applicant/appellant,
was
successful
in
his
alternative
route.
now,
when
it
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
when
congress
puts
in
a
statute
saying
that
there
shall
be,
as
it
did
in
1948,
a
petition
for
certiorari,
then
we
have
to
look.
i
should've
added
something
else.
in
1927,
the
routes
were
no
longer
alternative
and
cumulative.
they
were
split.
and
the
applicant
had
to
elect
which
way
he'd
go,
and
if
he
elected
the
so-called
alternative
route
as
opposed
to
bill
in
equity
route
that
was
the
end
of
the
road
for
him.
if
he
got
locked
there,
he
couldn't
come
back
and
have
his
bill
in
equity.
now,
when
we
look
at
a
statute
to
determine
the
purpose
of
1256
which
is
the
certiorari
statute
here,
what
was
congress
trying
to
do.
were
they
trying
to
effect
a
change
in
policy
or
to
formulate
a
new
plan
of
judicial
review?
we
submit
that
what
occurred
here
is
simply
that
congress
realized
all
at
once
or
there
used
to
be,
and
there
was
for
112
years,
an
alternative
and
cumulative
route.
go
one
way
you
get
a
week,
come
back,
go
by
bill
in
equity.
and
we
took
that
away
in
1927.
now,
when
we
put
in
this
section
1256
we
restore,
there's
no
change
in
policy,
we
restore
the
historic
right
of
an
applicant/appellant
who
was
defeated
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
have
a
try
for
petition
to
this
court,
and
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
court
to
change
the
situation
as
to
the
commissioner
of
patents
who
had
never
had
any
right
for
112
years
to
go
beyond
the
decision
of
the
alternative
court
if
he
got
leaked
there.
and
the
reason
we
say
that
is
specifically
is
this.
the
legislative
history
of
the
first
four
drafts
of
section
1256
contained
the
words,
cases
in
the
ccpa
may
be
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
by
certiorari
granted
on
petition
of
any
party.
those
words
‘of
any
party'
were
taken
out
before
the
bill
was
enacted.
now,
if
you
will
look
at
section
1244,
you
will
observe
--
1254,
that's
the
statute
coming
up
by
the
bill
in
equity,
you'll
observe
the
words
that
of
any
party
are
there.
and
1255
which
deals
with
a
review
of
cases
in
the
court
of
claims
have
the
word
petition
of
the
united
states
or
the
claimant.
we
submit
the
omission
of
that
language
of
any
party
was
deliberate.
the
significance
of
the
omission
of
the
‘any
party'
language
is
further
brought
out
by
looking
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
parallel
as
here
of
section
1255
which
started
with
the
words
‘of
any
party'
and
those
words
were
changed
to
read
of
the
united
states
or
the
claimant.
now,
we
think
when
they
took
the
words
out
of
any
party,
the
reason
for
it
was
this
that
it
was
deliberate
and
the
reason
was
this.looking
at
section
1244
--
i'm
sorry
244,
i'll
get
it
straight.
section
144
of
35
u.s.c,
if
you
go
back
in
the
history
of
that
action,
here's
what
that
provides.
it
provides
that
upon
the
determination
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
they
shall
return
to
the
commissioner
a
certificate
of
its
proceedings
and
decision
which
shall
be
entered
the
record
of
the
patent
laws
and
govern
the
further
proceedings
in
the
case.
we
think
it
governs
the
commissioner.
and
i'll
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
patent
act
of
1836
where
the
statute
was
a
little
more
specific
at
that
time
and
said
that
there
shall
be
a
decision
by
the
appellant
or
in
a
route
tribunal
and
their
opinion
being
certified
to
the
commissioner.
he
shall
be
governed
thereby
in
the
further
proceedings
that
we
have
any
application.
and
that
language
is
persisted
right
down
to
the
present
time
that
the
patent
office
gets
--
the
commissioner
gets
back
a
certificate
and
the
patent
office
shall
be
governed.
and
therefore,
if
it's
governed,
it
doesn't
have
any
right
to
appeal
and
it
never
had
a
right
of
appeal
historically
for
a
100
--
appeal
or
petition
to
go
beyond
if
the
appellant
elected
the
alternative
route,
the
commissioner
never
having
a
right
to
go
any
farther
if
he
got
leaked.
and
we
submit
therefore
that
historically,
he
should
not
have
that
right
now
and
it
was
not
the
intent
or
purpose
of
congress
to
restore
that
right.
and
they
so
indicated
when
they
took
out
those
words
of
any
party
from
the
legislative
history.
mr.
dean
laurence
mr.
justice
harlan,
you're
precisely
correct.
i
did
not
discuss
it
because
at
that
time
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dean
laurence
may
i
answer
that
question
in
this
way?
we
say
there
is
a
preliminary
question
here
which
must
be
decided
before
the
court
gets
even
to
the
merits
question
at
all,
and
that
was
that
the
primary
examiner
who
decided
the
affidavits
could
not
comply
had
no
authority
to
make
that
decision
because
under
section
135
of
title
35,
only
the
board
of
patent
and
interferences
can
make
any
determination
of
priority.
and
what
the
examiner
was
doing
was
making
a
determination
of
priority
here
in
this
case
when
he
said,
“your
affidavits
are
not
sufficient
to
entitle
you
to
get
into
the
interference.”
he
effectively
made
that
determination
of
priority.
he
thereby
usurped
the
function
of
the
board
of
patent
interference.
and
i
mentioned
this
earlier
that
rule
204
(b)
has
been
amended
so
that
the
primary
examiner
no
longer
makes
the
kind
of
determinations
which
he
made
here.
this
case
is
moot
as
far
as
rule
204
(b)
is
concerned.
that
rule
has
been
amended
so
that
now
all
the
primary
examiner
does
is
look
at
the
affidavit
to
see
that
there's
a
date
in
there
before
filing
date
of
the
patentee,
then
he
declares
the
interference
and
fires
it
over
to
the
board
of
patent
and
interferences
where
it
belongs
to
be
determined.
mr.
dean
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
we
started
our
contention
by
a
petition
to
the
commissioner
on
the
point.
we
petitioned
the
commissioner,
the
commissioner
said
that
that
was
at
record
36,
is
our
petition
to
the
commissioner,
the
commissioner
said,
“not
me,
i
think
it's
an
appellate
matter.”
and
then
we
went
to
the
appeal
on
the
jurisdictional
point
--
jurisdictional
sense
of
whether
the
primary
examiner
had
a
right
to
make
this
decision.
we
also
raise
the
question
in
the
ccpa,
so
we
have
argued
it
all
the
way
through.
mr.
dean
laurence
the
principle
involved
perhaps
is
not
a
moot
principle
here
and
it
--
the
court
inquired,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
black
who
asked
whether
this
case
had
any
far
reaching
effect.
let
me
say,
and
it's
covered
in
our
brief
that
it
does
have
in
one
respect,
it's
not
a
test
case
here.
this
isn't
a
$2
or
$36
case
like
your
honors
had
yesterday.
it's
not
a
test
case.
it
goes
only
to
the
point
if
you'll
have
to
look
at
the
tva
act,
the
nasa
act,
the
aec
act
because
what
you're
deciding
here
is
when
is
a
process
invention
completed?
and
those
acts
generally
speaking
provide
that
a
man
working
for
the
government
completes
his
invention,
if
he
completes
his
invention,
it
belongs
to
the
government.
if
he
doesn't
complete
his
invention
until
after
he's
gone
off
the
government
payroll,
then
it
doesn't
belong
to
the
government.
now,
suppose
that
a
man
conceives
his
invention,
he
thinks
of
a
process
and
he
thinks
of
a
way
of
carrying
it
out,
he
even
carries
it
out
but
he
doesn't
thrust
with
the
product
which
he
makes
while
he
is
in
the
government
employee
or
working
on
a
nasa
or
aec
contract.
then
he
leaves
the
government.
so
after
he's
left
the
government,
he
remembers
what
he
was
doing
and
he
repeats
the
process,
which
he
probably
entitled
to
unless
it's
a
secret
matter
and
he
makes
a
product.
and
he
then
fusses
with
a
product
and
finds
some
use
for
it,
and
so
he
goes
in
patents
of
process
that
he
has
no
right
to
--
mr.
dean
laurence
as
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
it
would
be
whether
you
would
remand
--
mr.
dean
laurence
i
think
we
would
have
to
do
it
this
way.
if
there
was
a
remand
to
make
a
different
affidavit
perhaps
that
could
be
done,
otherwise
of
course
the
real
purpose
here
is
to
get
the
interference,
and
if
we
get
the
interference
we'll
have
to
prove
this
utility.
mr.
dean
laurence
it
could
be
sent
back
to
--
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
manson
could
make
an
affidavit
which
was
in
better
form,
i
suppose,
in
compliance.
but
i
think
actually
here
--
mr.
dean
laurence
it's
not
possible
after
the
board
of
appeals
has
made
its
decision.
mr.
dean
laurence
the
record
does
not
so
reflect,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
laurence
i
was
not
in
the
case
until
after
the
case
was
through
the
board
of
appeals,
so
i
cannot
say.
but
i
think
i've
seen
the
complete
record
and
i
think
i
can
say
that
there
is
no
request.
there
were
five
attempts
to
put
in
a
satisfactory
affidavit.
mr.
dean
laurence
i
would
submit,
mr.
justice
harlan,
for
the
benefit
of
the
chemical
industry.
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
a
decision
on
the
abstract
principle
presented
here
--
mr.
dean
laurence
we
--
we
question
whether
it
is
presented
by
this
case,
but
if
it
is
we
think
it
ought
be
decided
here
rather
than
remanded.
mr.
dean
laurence
to
the
board
of
appeals?
mr.
dean
laurence
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
did
not
argue
to
the
board
of
appeals.
i
was
not
in
the
case
but
i
--
mr.
dean
laurence
i
think
it
was
argued
to
the
board
that
the
product
was
useful
as
shown
by
the
journal
article.
thank
you,
your
honor.
