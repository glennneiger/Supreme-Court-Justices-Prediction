justice
abe

it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
been
as
simple
as
that,
mr.
manson
in
his
affidavit
would've
said,
“why,
this
is
good
as
an
impact
tumor
business”
or
whatever
it
is.
now,
what's
happened
is,
i
have
read
the
record,
is
that
the
examiner
and
the
board
said
that
you
just
hadn't
made
that
sort
of
a
statement.
you
just
had
not
claimed
that
this
process
has
any
utility
in
terms
of
being
able
to
produce
a
product
or
in
terms
of
being
an
intermediate
stage
in
the
production
of
the
compound
which
would
be
useful.
now,
that's
a
simple
matter
that
the
language,
why
didn't
you
amend
the
affidavit.
frankly,
i
can't
read
the
--
i
want
you
to
help
me
on
this.
i
can't
read
this
record
without
the
feeling
that
perhaps
there's
a
little
more
to
it
than
that.
why
didn't
he
use
the
same
language
that
was
used
in
the
article,
in
the
journal
article?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
isn't
the
point
which
i'm
trying
to
get
your
help.
after
he
filed
that,
you
had
a
great
to
do
about
what
--
if
your
statement
just
made
is
correct,
it
turns
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
semantics.
and
it's
hard
for
it
to
me
to
believe
that
if
this
is
just
a
quarrel
about
the
choice
of
words
that
the
affidavit
could
not
and
would
not
have
been
corrected.
now,
both
the
examiner
and
the
reviewing
board,
as
i
read
it,
say
that
the
statement
made
by
mr.
manson
is
not
synonymous
with
claiming
any
specific
utility.
and
that
was
reiterated
by
the
board
of
appeals.
and
as
i
read
it,
i
must
say
in
light
of
this,
it
seemed
to
me
that
mr.
manson's
affidavit
rather
carefully
avoided
making
any
claim
of
specific
utility
rather
than
what
he
was
saying
was
that
if
the
process
described
in
the
journal
article
was
useful,
and
i
believe
--
i
believe
mine
is
going
to
be
useful
to,
which
it
seems
for
me
could
reasonably
be
said
to
fall
short
of
a
claim
of
utility.
that's
the
way
i
read
what
he
said
in
light
of
the
subsequent
statements
of
the
examiner.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
he
didn't
--
he
is
said
that
he
didn't
make
a
product
like
the
product
described
in
the
journal
article.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
didn't
say
--
but
he
didn't
say
that
it
was
a
--
would
result
in
a
useful
product.
now,
apart
from
that,
i
might
directly
read
this
record
as
indicating
that
both
the
examiner
and
the
board
of
review
or
whatever
it's
called,
held
that
he
--
his
affidavit
did
not
aver
that
the
process
did
not
adequately
aver,
sufficiently
aver
that
the
process
is
useful.
is
that
what
they
held?
justice
abe
fortas
--
page
53,
last
line
in
the
first
full
paragraph.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
as
i
read
the
board's
statement,
they
say
that
your
process
may
be
such,
you
say
it's
a
different
process,
it's
a
new
process.
they
say
your
process
may
be
such
so
that
it
does
not
in
fact
produce
the
same
identical
compound,
for
example,
and
it's
referred
to
in
this
article.
and
it's
your
burden,
according
to
what
the
board
says,
to
show
that
your
process
will
not
produce
something
that
has
some
utility
and
that's
a
position
that
they
have
taken
and
it's
a
position
from
what
you're
appealing
here,
as
i
understand
it
or
what
you're
attacking
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
perhaps
i
misread
the
board's
statement,
but
as
i
read
the
statement,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
they
may
have
a
different
effect.
at
the
bottom
of
page
52,
the
fourth
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
page
52.
and
their
conclusion
is
that
it's
our
view
that
statutory
affirming
of
usefulness
of
the
product
cannot
be
presumed
really
because
it
happens
to
be
closely
related
to
another
compound
which
is
known
to
be
useful.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
you
aren't
in
any
position
to
make
a
claim
of
utility
for
this
precise
process,
if
i'm
mistaken.
justice

product,
though,
yes.
