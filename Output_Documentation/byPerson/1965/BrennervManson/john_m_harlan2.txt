justice
john
m.
harlan
glidden
disposed
of
the
constitutional
aspect
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
this
been
the
position
from
the
information
is
taken
now?
has
that
always
been
his
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
take
these
large
companies
that
are
engaged
in
what
is
called
pure
research,
experimental
research
spending
vast
amounts
of
money
without
knowing
whether
the
results
of
the
research
is
going
to
be
commercially
used
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
don't
file
an
application,
patent
application,
to
the
--
at
the
experimental
stage?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
they
accept
them
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
don't
get
them
for
the
process,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
hasn't
they
been
doing
that
before?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
they
keep
the
process
secret
and
not
dispose
it
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
how
does
anybody
knows
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
the
decision
we're
revealing
on
our
--
is
this
the
only
decision
in
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
first
time
this
has
been
decided?
justice
john
m.
harlan
process
patent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
it's
a
matter
isn't
it
that
a
construction
of
statute
this
case
could
go
either
way,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
interpreting
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
why
the
constitution
should
interpret
it
against
you
than
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
making
the
processes
is
useful.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
you
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you're
not
claiming,
are
you,
that
the
government's
position
here,
is
not
probably
before
us?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
jurisdictional
question.
you
are
saying
that
the
question
which
the
government
tenders
here
really
isn't
presented
by
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
got
a
flat
holding
by
the
court
of
customs
the
patent
appeals,
you
don't
have
to
allege
what
the
government
--
you
don't
have
to
show
what
the
government
says
that
must
be
showed
namely
that
the
new
process
results
in
a
useful
end
product.
now,
that's
the
court
of
customs
appeals
certainly
held
that,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
why
is
it
a
question
that
the
government
raises
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
there
are
some
things
in
your
brief
and
something
which
you
started
to
say
here
before
we
got
on
other
questions.
that
may
you
think
that
you
were
also
making
a
claim
that
the
court
--
the
case
was
never
properly
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
because
of
the
failure
to
follow
the
administrative
route
to
its
conclusion.
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
thought
i
saw
it
in
your
brief
and
i
didn't
find
any
answer
in
the
governments
brief
or
supplemental
brief
and
i
didn't
hear
you
argue
it,
but
i
just
wanted
to
know
whether
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
contend
before
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
that
they
shouldn't
entertain
the
appeals
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
didn't
make
any
application
to
amend
your
affidavit,
did
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
whether
it
is
or
--
well,
i
mean
even
before
the
board,
even
before
the
--
at
any
stage,
did
you
ask
to
leave
to
amend?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
got
the
impression,
perhaps
rightly
or
wrongly
that's
why
you
and
the
government
lock
horns
in
what
should
be
the
proper
resolution
that
you
prefer
to
stand
on
the
broad
proposition
that
you're
talking
about,
namely
that
you
don't
have
to
allege
the
utility
of
an
end
product,
or
rather
than
have
the
case
go
back
or
leave
to
amend
and
try
to
show
something
that
at
least
the
--
as
the
proceedings
worked
out
below
was
not
accepted
as
a
sufficient
showing
to
meet
that
original
gap
to
the
board.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
it's
the
abstract
then
we
ought
to
decide
if
it's
presented
by
this
case.
it's
a
different
thing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
had
one
other
question.
you
said
you
didn't
know
just
what
was
argued
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
are
the
briefs
in
that
court
printed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
suppose
that
that
would
disclose
whether
or
not
the
premise
on
which
the
case
was
argued.
