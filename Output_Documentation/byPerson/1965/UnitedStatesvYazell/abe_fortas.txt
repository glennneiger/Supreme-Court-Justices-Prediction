i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
hammett,
i
noticed
in
footnote
5
in
the
government's
brief
they
list
california
as
a
state
having
some
limitations
upon
the
capacity
of
married
women
to
contract.
and
that
suggest
to
me
this
question
you
happen
to
know
whether
there
is
--
whether
community
property
states
generally
restrict
in
some
way
the
capacity
of
married
women
to
contract
as
a
part
of
the
community
property
scheme?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
quite
understand
from
the
government's
brief
whether
they
have
thoroughly
considered
the
possibility
that
some
limitations
on
the
capacity
of
married
woman
to
contract
maybe
an
integral
part
of
the
states
community
property
system
and
if
it
is
a
community
--
an
integral
part
of
the
state's
community
property
system,
would
that
have
a
bearing
upon
the
result
to
be
reached
in
this
case,
i
merely
suggest
the
question
far
from
knowing
the
answer.
