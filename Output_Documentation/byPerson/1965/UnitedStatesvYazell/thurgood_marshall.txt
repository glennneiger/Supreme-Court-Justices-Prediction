mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
assume
i
am
called
upon
to
answer
the
question
about
our
brief
in
the
former
case.
while
the
brief
was
being
prepared
there
were
many
conferences
with
the
department
of
agriculture
and
indeed
other
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
we
tried
to
corral
everybody's
idea
into
a
brief.
when
the
brief
was
in
final
form
the
secretary
of
agriculture
notified
us
he
did
not
agree
with
the
government's
position
on
the
preemption
point
however
he
did
not
desire
to
have
that
point
set
out
in
the
brief.
it's
best
i
can
explain
what
happened.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
on
the
other
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
only
the
preemption
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'd
explain
the
statement
on
that.
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
is
most
of
this
happened
before
i
took
over.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
its
--
the
one
point
is
the
preemption
and
he
flatly
disagreed.
in
the
present
case
is
an
action
filed
in
the
district
court
in
the
western
district
of
texas
by
the
united
states
of
america
on
behalf
of
small
business
administration
seeking
to
recover
balance
due
on
a
promissory
note
executed
by
one
delbert
yazell
doing
business
as
yazell's
little
lake
agent
and
ethel
mae
yazell.
the
amount
involved
was
$47,019.
a
copy
of
the
note
was
attached
and
there
was
also
a
modification
of
the
note
attached.
immediately
thereafter
the
defendant
ethel
mae
yazell
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
asserting
that
no
action
could
lie
against
their
separate
estate
and
this
was
accompanied
by
an
affidavit
asserting
her
covertures.
and
that
the
defendant's
original
answer
after
yazell
again
asserted
her
coverture
and
dealt
with
--
yazell
pleaded
a
whole
lot
of
set
off
claims
etcetera.
now
the
plaintiff's
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
delbert
but
except
as
to
the
set
off
point
and
the
defense
of
coverture
of
ethel
yazell
was
deferred
for
briefing,
etcetera
and
finally
in
the
opinion
by
judge
hutcheson,
summary
judgment
was
given
for
ethel
mae
yazell.
and
the
--
in
his
opinion
judge
hutcheson
was
very
plain
to
the
point
and
he
pointed
out
that
the
sole
issue
was
whether
the
law
of
texas
where
the
contract
was
made
that
married
women
is
protected
by
coverage
of
a
personal
liability
under
contract
is
controlling
here
or
whether
since
the
transaction
was
a
transaction
with
the
federal
government,
the
texas
law
of
coverture
was
nullified
and
abrogated
and
then
he
specifically
held
no
and
he
disagreed
with
the
case
of
united
states
versus
helz
in
the
sixth
circuit.
on
the
other
hand
judge
prettyman
sitting
by
assignment
relying
on
the
clearfield
trust
case
held
that
it
is
opinioned
along
from
the
federal
government
as
a
federal
manner
and
should
be
governed
by
a
federal
law
and
not
the
state
statutes.
the
case
itself
is
by
no
means
difficult.
in
the
first
place
there's
no
question
with
the
facts
and
the
only
question
is
as
to
how
far
federal
agency
or
the
federal
government
is
bound
by
local
state
procedures.
the
first
part
of
our
brief
we
set
out
that
federal
law
alone
controls
in
this.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question
about
it
and
that
is
so
unless
congress
provides
to
the
contrary
like
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
or
one
of
those
types
of
statutes.
but
here,
there's
no
question
that
federal
law
governs,
indeed
the
respondent
agrees
that
federal
law
governs
the
case.
the
respondent
also
insists
that
the
state
of
texas
has
no
interest
at
all
in
this
matter
and
he
says
that
the
texas
statutes
are
not
involved.
it's
just
the
texas
property
rules
that's
concerned.
on
the
other
hand
when
you
take
the
clearfield
case
and
u.s.
against
standard
oil,
we
find
that
in
the
absence
of
an
applicable
act
of
congress,
the
federal
courts
must
fashion
the
governing
rule
of
law
according
to
their
own
standards,
the
federal
standards.
and
in
fashioning
this
rule
of
law
would
be
applied
due
consideration
must
be
give
to
cases
where
the
government's
purse
is
affected.
and
the
federal
courts
may
adopt
state
law
of
course
in
fashioning
their
own
as
they
did
in
other
cases.
for
example
the
bozeman
case
and
there
are
several
other
cases
relied
on
by
the
respondent
here.
however,
we
must
bear
in
mind
especially
with
small
business
administration
that
it
is
not
a
separate
governmental
corporation
rather
it's
an
integral
part
of
the
united
states
government
itself.
as
for
example
the
farm
credit
administration
about
which
this
court
held
as
the
farm
credit
administration,
there's
not
an
unincorporated
agency
of
the
united
states
government
administrative
and
lending
funds,
its
lending
funds
appropriated
by
congress
of
the
united
states
treasury
and
returning
the
money
to
the
treasury
upon
repayment.
in
short,
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
government
mechanism
itself.
now
the
cases
where
you'll
find
the
court
agreeing
to
the
state
laws
recording
instruments
etcetera
and
even
indeed
on
the
question
of
priority
of
liens
and
all
such
actions,
one
or
two
cases
the
court
is
going
so
far
as
to
say
we
do
this
because
in
doing
so
we're
following
the
law
of
all
of
the
states
or
we're
doing
it
because
the
majority
of
the
states
have
the
same
rule.
but
in
this
case
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
only
at
best
we
can
find
11
states
that
still
have
some
vestige
of
married
woman
disqualification.
on
the
other
hand
the
other
states
have
the
regular
law
that
everybody
follows.
this
court
has
taken
note
of
the
fact
that
covertures
about
is
archaic
as
any
rule
still
remaining
around
in
the
law.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
cert
--
i
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
question
of
this
governmental
function
of
distributing
funds
and
lending
funds
out,
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
could
interfere
with
right
of
the
united
states
citizen
to
obtain
aid
from
its
government.
the
sovereignty
clause
would
be
gone
then
it
seems
me,
article
6.
and
the
--
it
start
--
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
realize
on
the
other
hand
that
in
texas
alone
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
as
of
the
end
of
63
there
were
$46
million
in
business
loans
and
15
million
in
disaster
loans
outstanding
and
then
we
outlined
a
lot
of
money
in
the
other
11
states
that
have
this.
certainly
this
is
the
place
where
we
want
a
uniform
rule.
we
don't
want
a
rule
that
will
apply
to
one
group
of
married
women
in
one
state
and
a
group
of
married
women
in
another
state
to
the
contract.
the
congressional
purpose
of
cost
with
aid
and
assist
people
but
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief
they
are
required
to
get
as
much
security
as
can
be
had.
i
believe
that
the
cases
if
i
may
for
a
moment
get
to
the
respondent's
position
which
i
think
of
course
deserves
great
attention
but
the
main
thrust
is
that
since
congress
gave
small
business
the
right
to
make
rules
and
small
business
in
one
obvious
rules
involving
warehousing
of
the
assets
provides
that
they
shall
be
put
in
a
bonded
warehouse
unless
the
state
law
protects
the
lien
otherwise.
as
i
understand
the
respondent
position
as
said
by
putting
that
one
provision
and
one
regulation
they
adopted
all
of
the
state
laws
of
all
of
the
50
states
rather
than
48
when
the
law
is
adopted.
this
is
of
course
not
true
and
in
every
case
where
this
court
has
so
--
made
the
federal
claim
subject
to
state
rule.
it
has
been
to
get
uniformity,
not
to
destroy
uniformity
and
i
think
that's
the
difference
between
those
cases
in
this
case.
the
only
thing
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
been
unable
to
find
that
out
but
i
--
in
reading
the
--
reading
the
instruction
finance
law
and
this
other
business
cases
and
the
sba
cases
it
appears
to
me
that
they
used
a
local
form.
indeed
in
this
case
a
part
of
the
chattel
mortgage
was
a
separate
texas
affidavit
that
she
was
a
married
woman
which
was
i
assume
was
the
texas
law.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
render
some
of
the
cases
they're
bound
to
do
it
because
of
the
recording
cases
where
they
said
where
the
chattel
mortgage
wasn't
properly
recorded,
the
federal
government
was
lost.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
so
it
would
be
good
business
to
comply
with
the
local
rules
and
i'm
sure
they're
different.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
minors
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
minors
and
insane
and
the
third
group
which
the
restatement
set
out
as
normal
incapacities.
i
imagine
that
the
federal
rule
could
very
well
be
--
we
recognize
here
because
they're
the
same
in
most
of
the
states
although
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
sure
that
they're
quite
the
same.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean,
if
there's
any
uniformity
there
but
the
whole
point
is
a
need
for
uniformity
in
a
business
as
large
as
these
businesses
are
becoming.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
have
to
let
those
go
as
we
get
to
him
because
this
court
has
said,
yes
here
and
no
there
about
recording.
yes
here
and
no
there
as
to
the
liens
but
in
this
case
the
only
uniformity
we're
asking
is
that
coverture
not
be
a
defense
absolute
in
and
of
itself.
now
she
might
have
a
thousand
other
defenses
but
bring
them
out
but
don't
by
summary
judgment
throw
the
case
out
on
coverage
and
that's
the
rule
we
would
ask
the
federal
court
to
lay
down
as
was
done
in
the
other
case,
the
helz
case.
if
please
the
court
if
they
have
no
further
question
i
think
that's
about
our
position
as
set
out
in
the
brief.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
may
it
please
the
court
on
the
one
point
strikes
me
as
to
requiring
this
procedure
under
the
texas
law
which
requires
you
filing
a
piece
of
paper
and
is
lying
in
the
judges'
chambers
until
some
time
he
gets
around
to
doing
it.
that's
as
i
read
the
statute
and
with
the
disaster
loan
that
wouldn't
be
much
help.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
when
we're
dealing
with
the
united
states'
money
the
only
credits
we
are
interested
in
are
the
united
states.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
i
think
have
to
--
they
have
to
borrow
with
a
notice
of
the
texas
law
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
because
they're
bound
by
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
because
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
we're
not
starting
with
clearfield.
clearfield
said
and
the
standard
oil
company
was
even
made
specifically
clear
that
despite
errie
and
thompkins,
there
still
was
enough
law
left
that
were
solely
controlled
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
is
this
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
is
none.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
said
coverture
is
not
a
defense.
that's
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
say.
that
coverture
is
not
defense.
if
she's
got
a
defense
let
her
raise
it
but
she
should
not
give
summary
judgment
on
the
bare
fact
of
coverture
alone.
that
i
think
is
the
only
federal
law
that
makes
any
sense
when
you
compare
--
this
court
is
on
two
occasions
said
that
coverture
is
so
archaic
it
should
be
almost
disregarded
and
that's
the
only
thing
we
ask
and
we
therefore
ask
that
the
petition
be
granted.
thank
you.
