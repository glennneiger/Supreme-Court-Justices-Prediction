justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
in
reference
to
this
particular
law,
would
it
be
any
different
or
is
it
--
would
it
be
about
an
equivalent,
the
state
had
adopted
law
which
made
it
illegal
for
a
wife
to
borrow
money
from
the
federal
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any?
does
the
law
indicate
one
way
or
the
other
whether
women
are
eligible
for
loaning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
they
are?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
effect
of
this
is
to
make
it
impossible
isn't
it,
as
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
wife
to
borrow?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
they
lend
it
if
they
couldn't
collect
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
it
be
collect
--
is
it
collectible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
position
is
then
that
the
texas
law
does
not
relieve
a
woman
from
--
married
woman
from
liability
to
the
government
on
this
particular
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
just
want
to
understand
perfectly
what
your
law
is
and
as
i
understand
it,
under
your
texas
law
a
woman
who's
engaged
in
business
with
her
husband
who
borrows
money
from
the
government,
small
business
administration
is
free
from
being
liable
for
that
debt
so
that
can
be
collected,
so
that
its
collected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
a
community
property?
is
it
all
--
both
of
them
on?
is
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
to
reach
the
proposition
and
we
have
to
face
that
under
the
law
there
the
government
makes
a
loan
the
man
and
his
wife.
he
does
it
and
it's
terrible
because
the
chances
are
that
it
would
not
be
able
to
collect
it
from
the
wife.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'd
like
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
regulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
business
were
they
in?
