justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hammett,
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
that
unless
the
congress
has
said
this
that
the
state
law
is
to
apply
the
federal
contracts
that
when
you've
got
a
federal
contract
you
apply
the
federal
law
to
it.
and
that
the
state
law
had
anything
to
do
with
it
and
they're
just
preemption
or
there's
occupation
of
the
field
that
you
don't
have
to
get
around
this
thing
whether
the
congress
has
specifically
said
anything
or
any
agencies
specifically
said
anything
if
you
don't
get
around
with
the
conflict
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
the
--
what
about
just
the
narrow
--
much
narrower
point
that
at
any
time
you
have
a
federal
contract
--
that
the
federal
government
enters
into
a
contract
that's
authorized
by
the
statute
that
this
federal
law
governs
the
--
all
aspects
of
that
contract
and
that
state
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
unless
congress
expressly
says
that
it
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
but
you
don't
even
get
to
the
conflict
question.
government's
position
as
i
read
its
brief
is
that
once
you
have
a
government
contract
with
one
party
on
the
one
side
and
one
on
another
and
it's
a
government
contract.
the
federal
law
controls
all
aspects
of
that
contract,
liability,
everything
and
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
never
--
and
that
the
state
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
until
and
unless
that
congress
says
that,
well
this
is
a
federal
contract
but
nevertheless
we'll
adopt
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
federal
contract,
this
note?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
federal
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
state
law
got
anything
to
do
with
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
--
if
the
united
states
now
says,
"we
don't
want
to
go
to
this
law
of
texas,
its
federal
law
and
we're
going
to
find
the
federal
law
somewhere
else.
