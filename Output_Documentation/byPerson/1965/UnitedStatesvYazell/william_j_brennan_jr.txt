excuse
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
only
the
preemption
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
conflict
point
getting
over
the
preemption
point,
are
we
to
assume
the
--
that
would
express
the
fact
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
secretary
did
agree
with
you
on
the
conflict?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hammett,
may
i
ask
just
one
question.
from
what
--
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
black,
does
this
mean
that
all
that
the
texas
laws
saves
the
wife,
his
execution
of
this
judgment
against
her
separate
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
maybe
executed
against
the
community
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
as
on
the
facts
of
this
case
does
this
wife
have
separate
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
can't
be
reached
to
satisfy
this
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
argument
doesn't
conclude
in
reaching
into
the
law
of
arkansas
instead
of
texas,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
may
reach
out
and
pick
up
state
law
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
adopt
your
state
law,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
agree
that
the
state
law
that
the
fact
that
it's
a
federal
government
--
that
it's
a
federal
contract,
does
it
preempt
state
law
or
that
federal
law
governs
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
you
ought
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
a
matter
of
just
good
common
sense
and
that
where
better
can
you
go
doesn't
rule
all
the
state
where
the
lady
lives?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
other
case
and
this
very
suit
the
government,
the
petitioner
would
be
a
estopped
because
of
an
inconsistent
position
when
that
--
i
don't
understand
why
the
petitioners
not
estopped
as
a
matter
of
law
in
this
case.
the
regulation
that
mr.
marshall
referred
to
it
adopts
the
state
law
itself
in
plain
expressed
terms
and
not
only
does
it
do
that
but
that
is
this
case.
the
mortgage
in
this
case
covered
a
stock
of
merchandise
that
would
have
had
no
standing.
no
validity
except
that
given
to
it
by
the
state
statute
which
was
adopted
by
the
congress,
by
the
administrator
of
small
business
administration
in
the
form
of
his
regulations
and
more
importantly
in
this
contract
in
this
case,
their
note
and
the
chattel
mortgage.
their
reference
is
to
the
--
to
article
4000
of
the
texas
statute
