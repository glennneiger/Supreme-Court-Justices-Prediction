mr.
j.
v.
hammett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honors.
i
would
say
that
i
occupy
a
rather
curious
position
in
this
case
because
i
stand
here
and
say
that
small
business
administration
and
its
predecessor,
reconstruction
finance
corporation
has
performed
and
is
performing
one
of
the
great
services
to
the
citizens
in
this
country.
and
so
in
a
sense
i
stand
here
defending
the
methods
of
business
employed
by
those
two
agencies
in
their
lending
functions
to
private
enterprise.
they've
done
a
good
job
and
they've
done
that
good
job
upon
the
sole
basis
of
utilizing
as
a
ready
made
vehicle
to
property
laws
of
the
several
states
in
which
they
operate.
first,
the
one
simple
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
a
personal
judgment
against
this
mad
woman
who
had
been
sued
jointly
with
her
husband.
the
district
court
judge
ben
rice
ruled
that
personal
liability
against
the
married
woman
did
not
lie
basing
it
upon
a
community
property
rule
as
it
affects
the
married
woman
and
her
obligations
or
a
lack
of
obligation
in
joining
with
the
husband
in
executing
community
debts
where
a
community
property
only
is
involved.
that
judgment
was
affirmed
in
the
circuit
court
with
a
divided
or
a
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
prettyman.
now,
coverture
as
such
as
i
see
it
is
not
important
in
this
case
and
certainly
not
to
this
court.
if
there's
any
federal
law
on
quote
(inaudible)
i
don't
know
where
it
is.
i
think
that
the
one
thing
that
should
be
said
here
is
that
conseq
--
grave
consequences
can
result
easily
from
a
failure
to
grasp
the
importance
of
the
lending
agencies
not
just
this
one,
the
farmers
home
administration
and
the
others.
in
the
state
of
the
federal
law
they've
got
to
use
the
local
property
laws
and
each
of
the
states
where
they're
doing
business.
if
they
fail
to
do
that
then
you
have
this
curious
position.
reconstruction
finance
corporation
i
believe
is
created
somewhere
about
1930
and
it
operated
until
the
small
business
act
of
1953
when
the
succession
was
created.
and
none
of
this
legislation
did
the
congress
provide
a
set
of
property
laws
for
the
federal
administrators
to
use
in
discharging
the
public
policy
placed
upon
them
by
the
congress.
in
some
other
cases
the
omission
to
provide
those
property
laws
for
their
operation
has
been
persuasive
i
think
that
was
true
in
the
kramer
case
by
the
eight
circuit.
so,
to
get
right
along
with
it,
there
are
two
things
that
i
would
submit
in
behalf
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
which
i
believe
are
worthy
of
profound
consideration.
one
is
that
in
the
legislation
creating
small
business
administration
the
congress
adopted
directly
and
indirectly
and
i
repeat
this,
the
congress
did
adopt
local
property
rules
to
be
used
by
the
small
business
administration
as
appropriate
federal
rules
governing
the
validity
of
the
security
instruments
to
be
taken
by
--
i
said
appropriate
federal
rule
because
there
is
not
in
this
case
any
conflict
between
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
and
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
in
this
field.
there
is
no
conflict
if
there
is
then
the
federal
authority
prevails
without
any
question
but
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
the
congress
has
the
right
to
adopt
state
laws
or
to
absorb
them
as
it
were
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
one
of
the
cases
and
use
those
local
property
laws
in
the
discharge
of
the
federal
function
which
is
the
lending
of
money
to
private
enterprise.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
think
that
such
a
law
would
be
an
unconstitutional
law
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
state
can
interfere
if
the
congress
says
we
want
to
lend
money
to
two
year
old
boys
and
to
women
who've
been
married
five
times
and
to
nobody
else.
i
don't
think
the
state
would
have
any
standing
to
question
that.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
congress
does
not
place
any
limitation
by
definition
or
otherwise
upon
who
is
or
is
not
legally
capable
of
contracting
but
just
have
--
it
says
that
you
can
lend
money
and
take
note
some
security
instruments
for
it
and
not
another
word,
then
i
think
you
must
look
somewhere
to
determine
who
is
legally
capable
of
contracting.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
it
does
not
specifically.
i'm
sure
it
does
not.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
think
they
are.
they
were
in
texas
both
before
and
after
the
--
this
coverture
law
of
statute
was
amended.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
no
sir,
not
at
all
sir.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
not
at
all.
that's
one
of
the
misconceptions
about
this
lawsuit.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
meant
to
say
that
a
married
woman
could
sign
a
valid
contract
even
under
the
texas
state
law.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
yes
sir.
it
was
before
this
1963
stat
--
texas
statute
amendment
and
it
is
since
then.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
my
--
i
don't
believe
that
i
am
conveying
what
i
am
trying
to
say
to
you
sir.
i
say
this
that
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
statute
that
says
that
a
loan
to
a
married
woman
is
or
is
not
valid
or
invalid
or
anything
about
it
specifically.
the
texas
law
of
coverture
says
this
that
on
a
community
debt
a
wife
signing
the
note
with
her
husband
is
not
personally
liable
but
she
can
create
personal
liability
for
her
separate
estate
and
she
can
even
before
the
amendment
she
could
have
her
disabilities
of
coverture
removed
and
engage
in
business
and
borrow
money
just
like
any
other
adult
person.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
no
sir.
that's
not
the
way
it
works.
that
--
now,
you
can't
take
a
personal
judgment
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
--
against
that
wife
unless
she
has
had
her
disabilities
or
coverture
removed
under
the
statute
then
she's
fully
liable
but
if
it's
as
just
a
regular
community
debt
where
she
has
not
qualified
to
do
business
then
if
she
merely
signs
the
note
with
her
husband
there
is
no
personal
liability
on
her
part
for
the
simple
reasons
sir
that
she
has
not
one
thing
on
earth
to
say
about
the
community
property
or
its
management
in
texas.
now
i
suppose
in
the
other
community
property
estate,
that's
solely
vested
in
the
husband.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
now
the
reason
she
didn't
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
no
sir,
it
would
not
be.
they
--
each
one
or
either
one
could
own
property
that
we
call
separate
property
depending
upon
whether
they
received
it
and
owned
it
before
marriage
or
received
it
by
gift
or
device.
without
some
rule
of
that
kind
the
community
property
laws
would
be
a
mess
to
administer.
you
just
got
to
fixed
the
management
in
one
or
the
other.
it's
hard
enough
for
them
to
get
along
although
sometimes
in
those
areas
where
they
have
to
talk
the
business
over
but
you'll
all
better
designate
a
husband
or
a
wife.
i
heard
judge
slaton
say
at
one
time
about
his
wife
after
she'd
already
make
a
speech
that
what
thought,
it
was
(inaudible),
i
thought
it
was
old,
talking
about
the
community
property
where
she
had
half
of
it
and
he
had
half
and
she
was
kidding
about
thinking
she
owned
it
all
up
until
that
night.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
not
at
all
sir.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
not
at
all.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
that
is
not
correct.
the
government
in
this
very
case
recovered
a
judgment
that
is
as
plenary
as
it
could
recover
in
any
case
anywhere
so
long
as
you
recognize
the
contract
law
in
that
or
any
given
contract.
in
this
case
it
happens
to
be
that
the
judgment
runs
against
all
the
community
property
they
own
or
ever
will
own.
but
the
government
got
everything
that
it
contracted
to
get
when
that
lady
signed
that
note.
why
did
she
sign
the
note?
one
of
the
main
reasons
and
it's
a
common
practice
in
texas
because
when
she
signs
it
to
eliminate
any
possibility
of
her
later
claiming
that's
my
separate
property
and
my
husband
has
no
right
to
give
you
that
mortgage.
that's
the
primary
reason.
there
are
one
or
two
others
but
they
are
not
so
important
here.
i
would
say
sir
that
whatever
the
wisdom
may
be
that
this
is
covered,
this
question
and
this
lawsuit
is
covered
by
the
federal
act
itself
that
congress
did
adopt
the
local
property
laws
in
each
state
where
a
small
business
administration
is
to
operate.
and
i
will
say
this
to
you
that
that's
been
the
unquestioned
interpretation
by
the
small
business
administration
throughout
its
suggestions
and
i
understand
it
was
also
of
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
right
sir.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
right
sir,
absolutely
correct.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
not
yet
sir.
there
is
an
expectation
unless
he
probably
does
something
else
that
she
will
a
small
inheritance.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
sir
i
believe
that
if
the
congress
expresses
itself
or
if
that's
the
interpretation
of
this
court
then
and
there
was
a
conflict
then
by
all
means
the
federal
statute
would
prevail.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
think
that
it
does
not.
a
state
law
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it
unless
it's
used
as
a
federal
rule
as
the
appropriate
federal
rule.
i
don't
think
the
states,
any
state
can
control
what
the
congress
does.
i
don't
--
if
i'm
--
understand
your
question,
if
there
should
be
a
conflict
the
federal
statute
would
prevail.
but
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
yet
from
the
standpoint
of
source
our
sovereignty
yes
sir
i
agree
with
that
position.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
think
that's
right
and
then
if
congress
fails
to
say
that
this
court
can.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
but
using
it
as
an
--
the
appropriate
federal
rule.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
yes,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
because
the
united
states
government
is
a
party
to
the
contract
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
--
and
this
court
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
small
business
administration
can
operate
in
a
void
or
a
vacuum.
i
mean
that's
exactly
the
position
they're
in,
if
you
can't
find
some
body
of
property
law
somewhere
that
they
can
use
in
performing
their
functions
and
the
only
place
you
can
find
that
body
of
law
is
in
the
state
property
laws.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
oh,
i
think
that
would
--
i
--
the
congress
can
pick
any
standard
it
wants.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
let
me
answer
it
this
way
as
i
see
it.
this
is
a
contract
with
the
government.
therefore
federal
questions
are
involved.
therefore
the
laws
that
govern
or
control
will
be
federal
rules.
now
those
federal
rules
may
find
their
origin
and
context
and
their
cohesiveness
in
the
state
property
laws.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
say
that
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i'd
hate
the
job
of
having
to
provide
that
body
through
a
set
of
regulations.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
--
which
authorize
that
mortgage
and
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
haven't
said
this.
i
don't
claim
to
know
much
about
the
laws
of
another
state
but
of
the
two
or
three
other
community
property
states
but
i
have
just
a
small
knowledge
of.
first
their
law
places,
their
management
in
control
of
the
community
of
the
state
in
the
husband
and
secondly
as
a
corollary
to
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
limitation
on
the
contracts
of
the
wife
only
to
this
extent
perhaps
but
this
is
necessary
that
it
appeared
clearly
at
all
times
what
she
is
contracting
when
she
signs
her
name
and
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
--
if
you
don't
have
that
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
think
it
does
sir.
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
yes
sir,
it's
--
you
mean
the
small
business
regulations?
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
on
page
5
of
the
brief,
regulation
122.17
f.
and
regulation
123.7
aa
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
and
i
would
like
to
close
by
this
one
comment
that
this
is
a
--
what
they
call
a
disaster
loan,
this
was
following
flood.
the
small
business
administration
if
it
did
nothing
else
that
this
fade
and
the
disaster
loan
program
is
a
tremendous
program
and
it
could
not
function
literally,
could
not
function
without
using
the
state
laws
that
we're
using
in
this
case.
this
judgment
ought
to
be
affirmed
your
honors.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
only
in
a
sense
judge
it
was
a
community
of
man
and
wife.
there
were
no
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
dry
goods,
retail
dry
goods.
it
was
not
a
partnership
though
when
the
usual
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
yes.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
that
was
--
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
--
the
way
we
did
it
before
1963
when
that
statute
was
changed
so
as
to
now
permit
her
to
simply
say
i
make
this
contract
in
my
own
name
by
--
in
my
own
property
and
now
she
can
do
anything
she
wants
to
do
when
it's
done
that
way.
mr.
j.
v.
hammett
absolutely,
absolutely,
thank
you
very
much.
