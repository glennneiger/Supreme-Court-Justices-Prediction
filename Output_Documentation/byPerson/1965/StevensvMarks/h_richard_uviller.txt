mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
at
the
outset
to
a
matter
which
has
obviously
troubled
the
court
during
the
presentation
by
the
petitioner.
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
he
would
have
received
immunity
under
new
york
law.
had
he
been
correct
in
his
contention
that
his
waiver
of
immunity
was
invalid?
i'm
sure
they
were
all
agreed
to
the
outset
that
if
the
waiver
was
indeed
a
free
and
valid
waiver
of
immunity
then
a
contempt
conviction
could
lie
for
compelling
him
to
answer
questions
pursuant
to
such
a
waiver.
the
real
question
is,
could
he
be
compelled
to
answer
questions
if
he
was
right
and
his
waiver
of
immunity
was
in
fact
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
invalid.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
i
understand
his
position
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
that
the
coercion
invalidated
the
waiver
and
so
that
the
question
of
whether
this
--
the
new
york
constitutional
provision
is
unconstitutional
really
goes
to
his
contention
as
to
the
validity
of
the
waiver.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
has
asserted
our
position
from
the
outset.
at
the
time
that
he
was
before
the
judge
in
the
supreme
court
where
--
ordered
him
to
answer,
he
asserted
that
position
that
the
constitutional
provision
was
coercive
and
the
waiver
has
not
been
freely
given
and
consequently,
he
couldn't
be
compelled
to
answer
pursuant
to
that
waiver.
it
was
the
people's
position
at
that
time
and
it
still
is
the
people's
position
that
that
waiver
was
not
coerced
and
it
wasn't
valid
in
finding
waiver.
but
with
respect
to
regan,
the
question
that
we
must
ask
ourselves
is
what
if
he
was
right.
i
suppose
the
waiver
was
invalid
for
one
reason
or
another
or
would
he
have
been
completely
protected?
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
on
that
question,
this
court
is
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
moreover,
it
is
not
merely
implicit
in
that
court's
reliance
on
regan,
it
is
quite
explicit
and
i
quote
now
from
the
record
in
210
where
the
memorandum
decision
of
the
appellate
division
is
reproduced
on
page
43
where
the
court
says,
“if
the
waiver
were
invalid,
petitioner
would
have
received
immunity
from
prosecution
under
sections
381
and
2447
of
the
penal
law.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
decision
was
october
30th,
1964
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
indeed.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
was
on
210
mr.
justice
black
at
43.
the
circuit
court
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
381
as
amended,
there
still
be
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
the
previous
automatic
immunity
was
under
the
former
section
381
but
there
is
still
a
381
which
provides
that
immunity
may
be
granted
in
prosecutions
for
a
certain
nature
of
crime
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
2447.
2447
is
the
new
statute
that
provides
the
procedures.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
exactly
as
explicit
on
page
61
of
290.
that
court
said,
and
i'll
have
to
skip
a
few
words,
but
it
said
in
effect,
“indeed
if
stevens'
waiver
is
defective
as
we
view
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
state
penal
law,
immunity
from
prosecution
will
automatically
follow,”
and
they
cited
2447.
so
that
there
is
--
i
suggest
at
this
point
nothing
for
this
court
to
decide
as
to
whether
or
not
he
would
have
received
immunity
from
prosecution
pursuant
to
state
law
if
he
had
followed
the
court's
directions
and
responded.
now
if
that
is
conclusive
as
we
submit
it
is,
then
this
case
is
factually
indistinguishable
from
the
regan
case.
now
it's
true
that
there
has
been
a
major
change
in
the
law
in
new
york
as
there
has
been
the
federal
law
as
to
the
procedures
by
which
immunity
is
granted
prior
to
the
enactment
of
2447,
anybody
witnessed
or
target
called
before
a
grand
jury
who
was
asked
an
incriminating
question
and
answered
that
question
received
immunity
and
that
was
that.
2447
was
intended
to
be
a
benefit
to
the
prosecutor.
2447
obviously
was
to
protect
the
sleepy
--
the
nodding
prosecutor
from
an
inadvertent
grant
of
immunity
to
a
witness
who
--
to
his
surprise
came
out
with
a
self-incriminatory
answer.
and
it
provided
that
in
order
to
get
immunity,
the
witness
must
himself
alert
the
prosecutor
that
he
has
about
to
become
immunized
by
asserting
his
privilege.
at
that
point,
certain
procedures
have
provided
by
which
he
can
be
commanded
to
answer
and
if
he
does,
receives
immunity.
the
federal
procedure
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
there
is
not.
the
--
under
the
competent
authority
section
of
2447,
it
is
provided
that
the
form
in
--
on
the
expressed
request
of
the
district
attorney
shall
order
the
witness
to
answer
does
not
say
that
he
shall
explain
to
him
that
he
has
received
immunity.
it
also
says
that
the
court
may
order
a
witness
who
asserts
his
privilege
to
answer
presumably
without
the
question
of
the
district
attorney
in
a
matter
except
a
proceeding
before
the
grand
jury.
so
the
only
real
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
court
in
this
case
in
ordering,
it
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
form
and
whether
or
not
he
was
a
competent
authority.
i
suggest
there's
no
real
question
here
in
as
much
as
it
was
decided
below
that
immunity
would
have
been
granted.
and
furthermore,
it's
--
i
think
quite
unusual
to
assume
that
a
district
attorney
could
under
these
circumstances
ever
assert
in
the
future
that
the
man
had
not
been
granted
immunity
because
the
technical
requirements
of
2447
were
not
complied
with.
and
the
law
of
the
case
as
decided
by
the
appellate
division
is
to
that
effect.
now,
in
the
laino
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is.
as
to
immunity
in
the
counselman
against
hitchcock
sentence,
immunity
in
the
counselman
against
hitchcock
sentence
may
be
conferred
only
pursuant
to
2447
in
new
york
and
that
does
require
the
district
attorney
to
make
an
election
just
as
it
requires
the
witness
to
make
an
election
of
asserting
his
privilege.
however,
we
do
have
in
new
york
and
this
is
where
it
gets
really
unfortunately
complicated,
another
kind
of
testimonial
protection
and
that
is
the
type
of
testimony
and
protection
that
was
involved
in
the
laino
case.
that
is
not,
strictly
speaking,
immunity
in
the
counselman
against
hitchcock
sense.
it
is
not
complete
protection
against
prosecution
of
such
a
nature
as
it
will
supplant
or
replace
privilege
against
self-incrimination
but
it
is
a
form
of
protection.
and
what
it
is,
is
simply
this
and
this
is
decided
in
the
case
of
people
against
steuding
in
new
york
cited
in
our
brief
by
judge
fuller,
written
by
judge
fuller.
judge
fuller
says
that
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
2447
in
new
york
where
a
target
of
an
investigation
or
a
potential
defendant
is
called
before
a
grand
jury
he
is
there
illegally
at
the
start.
he
said
that
a
potential
defendant
derives
his
rights
against
self-incrimination
directly
from
article
i,
section
6
of
the
new
york
constitution
which
provides
that
he
shall
not
be
a
witness
against
himself.
so
that
if
the
prosecutor
does
in
violation
of
his
rights
call
him
and
swear
him
as
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury,
he
acquires
a
certain
type
of
protection
and
that
protection
is
that
he
cannot
be
indicted
by
that
grand
jury.
he
cannot
be
punished
for
contempt
if
he
fails
to
answer.
he
cannot
be
punished
for
forgery
if
answers
falsely
because
the
oath
is
not
validly
administered
to
say
and
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
any
evidence
that
may
have
been
uncovered
by
virtue
of
his
testimony.
however,
as
occurred
--
as
was
upheld
by
the
appellate
courts
when
steuding's
co-defendant
was
reindicted
by
a
fresh
grand
jury
he
maybe
reindicted
or
indicted
by
an
--
only
if
a
different
grand
jury
acting
upon
fresh
and
independent
evidence.
in
effect,
it
is
the
kind
of
protection
which
this
court's
action
in
murphy
against
the
waterfront
by
overruling
the
kelvin
case.
nonetheless,
this
is
a
form
of
protection
which
does
attach
in
new
york
automatically
if
the
potential
defendant
himself
is
called
as
a
witness.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
laino
holding
and
that
was
the
basis
of
steuding
against
ryan.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
not.
the
district
attorney
took
the
position
that
this
particular
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
a
grant
of
immunity
in
exchange
for
his
testimony
because
he
had
executed
a
waiver
of
that
immunity,
however,
despite
the
district
attorney's
failure
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
that
regard,
the
courts
of
new
york
have
held
that
if
the
defendant
had
answered
the
questions
albeit
on
a
different
theory,
he
would
nonetheless
have
been
immunized.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
was
trying
to
pinpoint
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
you'll
find
that
in
this
very
case
in
the
decisions
below
which
i
read
to
your
honor
was
--
were
the
decisions
in
this
very
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
the
third
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
that's
correct.
it's
after
the
fact
as
to
that
particular
case
but
not
after
the
fact
in
a
subsequent
refusal.
in
any
event,
at
the
time
just
before
he
was
held
in
contempt
of
the
court,
there
was
a
colloquy,
a
discussion
before
the
judge
who
held
them
in
contempt
to
court
at
which
time,
and
this
is
in
the
record
as
well,
at
which
time
the
district
attorney
discussed
the
applicability
of
the
regan
case
which
i
just
come
down
at
that
point.
and
the
district
attorney
maintained
in
the
presence
of
defendant
and
his
counsel
to
the
court
that
the
stevens
case
was
indistinguishable
from
regan
and
that
the
same
double
protection
which
was
accorded
to
regan
under
the
statute
which
was
then
applicable
would
be
available
to
the
defendant
in
this
case.
he
did
not,
mind
you,
abandon
his
theory
that
the
defendant
had
waived
his
immunity.
but
he
did
indicate
that
if
he
was
wrong
in
that
theory,
the
defendant
would
be
accorded
so
that,
again,
the
law
of
the
case
is
--
from
the
very
outset,
the
very
issues
which
we
are
now
arguing
were
known
and
were
before
the
court
and
in
the
defendant's
knowledge.
now
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
steuding
case
and
the
laino
case
have
revived
the
efficacy
of
this
waiver
of
immunity.
when
2447
was
enacted,
the
slip
of
paper
which
is
called
the
waiver
of
immunity
might
be
thought
to
have
been
a
--
an
anachronistic
relic
of
no
further
significance
because
obviously
if
the
only
way
you
get
immunity
is
by
asserting
your
privilege,
then
presumably
the
correct
way
to
waive
immunity
would
be
to
answer
the
question
without
asserting
the
privilege.
and
in
the
point
of
fact,
i'm
informed
that
that
is
precisely
the
way
potential
defendants
waive
their
immunity
in
federal
proceedings.
nonetheless,
we
have
this
slip
of
paper
called
a
waiver
of
immunity
which
before
is
the
people's
theory,
it
is,
was
binding
upon
the
defendant.
well
the
efficacy
of
that
slip
of
paper
becomes
apparent
when
you
consider
the
steuding
case
because
the
steuding
case
returns
the
potential
defendant
and
this
petitioner
was
denominated
a
potential
defendant
from
the
outset.
returns
him
to
the
position
he
was
in,
as
regan
was,
before
2447
not
that
he
receives
complete
and
total
immunity
but
that
he
does
receive
very
extensive
murphy
type
of
protection
if
you
will.
consequently,
if
he
did
not
execute
this
waiver
of
immunity,
before
being
sworn,
he
would
have
received
protection
against
indictment
by
that
grand
jury,
a
protection
against
the
use
of
his
testimony
or
his
moots
in
any
future
proceeding.
consequently,
if
that
waiver
of
immunity
which
he
signed
was
a
legally
significant
and
operative
act
from
which
legal
consequences
flow.
in
point
of
fact,
there
is
a
law
in
new
york
that
no
potential
defendant
may
be
called
before
a
grand
jury
unless
he
executes
a
waiver
of
immunity.
consequently,
his
entry
into
the
floor,
the
opportunity
to
express
his
side
to
learn
the
questions
which
were
being
asked
to
see
the
financial
questionnaire
which
he
received
in
this
case
and
so
on
was
all
conditioned
upon
his
execution
of
that
instrument
known
as
a
waiver
of
immunity.
a
legally
operable
act,
an
act
which
an
adult
knowingly
undertakes
having
been
fully
advised
of
the
consequences
is
normally
binding.
and
as
a
waiver,
it
is
no
more,
no
less
finding
than
in
the
other
legally
operable
act.
it
is
not
an
insignificant
promise,
a
mere
undertaking
not
to
assert
any
privilege
but
is
a
significant
and
operable
act.
now,
there
has
been
a
much
made
during
oral
argument
by
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
under
the
steuding
case,
this
defendant
shouldn't
have
been
before
the
grand
jury
at
all
unless
he
signed
a
waiver.
in
other
words,
the
steuding
decision,
it's
a
short
decision
mr.
justice
white
of
--
it's
just
as
baffling
as
they're
short.
it
says
that
2447
does
not
apply
to
potential
defendant.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
i
think
not
under
regan
mr.
justice
white
and
here's
what
would
happen
under
that
hypothetical.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
steuding
goes
on
to
say
that
although
he
shouldn't
have
been
there,
if
he
is
there,
what
he
gets
is
limited
protection,
not
full
immunity
but
close
to
it.
so
that
--
while
it
says,
he
shouldn't
be
there
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
it
also
provides
the
effect
of
calling
him.
so
within
the
hypothetical
which
you
posed,
he
would
get
two
different
things
at
two
different
times
if
the
waiver
were
physically
coerced
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
would
get
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
positively.
he
would
get
steuding
protection
from
the
moment
he
took
the
oath.
he
would
also
get
complete
2447
immunity
from
the
moment
he
answer
that
question
under
compulsion.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
so
that
he's
completely
protected.
therefore
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
they
are
somewhat
different.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
what
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
definitely
mr.
chief
justice.
he
would
be
entitled
to
immunity
and
he
would
have
received
it
and
if
the
district
attorney
should
ever
attempt
to
prosecute
him
on
any
of
the
matters
reviewed
in
that
grand
jury,
he
would
have
a
valid
defense
to
such
an
indictment.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
would
say
that
we've
followed
it
substantially
that
we
would
be
estopped
from
asserting
any
technical
flaws
and
that
we
are
bound
by
the
decision
below
in
this
case
that
he
had
immunity.
consequently,
there
is
absolutely
no
question
as
to
stevens.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
he
didn't
--
oh
yes,
he
did.
he
did
need
to
answer
the
question
he
was
told
by
the
court
to
answer.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
must
obey
the
court's
direction
to
answer
because
his
privilege
was
being
fully
replaced
by
a
complete
immunity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
not
for
the
steuding
case
mr.
justice
fortas
but
this
very
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
by
this
very
case
but
of
course
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
well,
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
is
precisely
so
mr.
justice
fortas.
and
i
mean
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
we
have
--
no
but
that
is
our
--
indeed
my
position.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
has
been
our
position
from
the
outside
by
asserting
as
we
have
throughout
the
regan
case
and
by
obtaining
decisions
based
on
the
regan
case
throughout.
we
were
and
the
courts
were
in
this
case,
adopting
precisely
that
position
and
that
is
that
regan
is
still
operable,
it
still
sound
that
it
is
controlling.
this
court
did
not
take
certiorari
interestingly
enough
on
the
question
of
whether
regan
has
been
modified
by
malloy.
it
took
certiorari
on
a
quite
different
question.
but
we
have
nonetheless
asserted
throughout
that
regan
was
offered
and
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
for
one
reason
or
another
this
court
disagrees
with
us
and
believes
that
regan
has
been
in
some
way
overruled
or
has
lost
its
force
in
effect
as
a
result
to
either
of
the
change
of
immunity
laws
of
new
york
or
as
a
result
of
malloy
against
hogan.
then
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
courts
for
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
merits
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
constitution
where
this
court
accepted
certiorari
in
the
case
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
particular
provision
of
a
constitution
is
parallel
to
the
new
york
city
charter.
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
that
question
or
low
grades
was
explicitly
bypassed
by
every
court
below
on
the
grounds
that
regan
was
controlled.
as
a
result,
the
case
comes
to
this
court
as
a
case
in
which
the
issue,
the
very
issue
on
which
grant
was
cert
--
of
certiorari
was
given,
was
never
decided
either
in
this
case
or
in
any
other
case
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
suggest
that
--
for
that
reason
although
i
propose
now
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
question
on
which
cert
was
granted
that
certiorari
was
improperly
granted
and
should
be
dismissed
because
i
think
it
is
not
only
as
a
question
not
drawn
an
issue
by
the
decision
below
but
i
think
that
if
this
court
would
be
properly
reluctant
to
construe
or
to
rule
upon
the
constitutionality
of
such
an
important
provision
of
the
state
constitution
without
affording
the
courts
of
that
state
an
opportunity
to
do
so
first.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
the
way
it
sounded
to
me
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
don't
know
why
he
says
that
because
it
seems
quite
clear
to
me
that
contempt
is
a
proper
means
of
enforcing
a
testimony
from
a
reluctant
witness
who
cannot
be
harmed
that
way
and
it
has
been
repeatedly
held
by
this
court
and
in
some
quite
recent
cases
that
a
counselman
against
hitchcock
type
of
immunity
does
effectively
supplant
privilege.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
the
waiver
is
invalid.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
precisely.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
if
the
waiver
is
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
the
waiver
is
valid
then
we
come
to
a
second
somewhat
more
difficult
question
and
that
is
kind
of
be
withdrawn.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
it
is
non-revocable
and
valid
then
clearly
it
would
be
compelled
to
answer
under
the
waiver.
he's
waived
his
privilege,
he
doesn't
have
them.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
yes.
he
would
have
had
(inaudible)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
you
put
your
finger
on
a
very
puzzling
aspect
of
the
steuding
case
mr.
justice
white
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
steuding
case
has
to
be
read
together
with
the
other
immunity
cases
in
new
york.
and
together,
they
say,
that
he
shouldn't
be
called
but
if
he
is
called
and
immunized,
he
must
answer
because
no
immunity
case
has
ever
come
up
in
new
york
involving
anyone
except
potential
defendants.
it's
only
the
potential
defendant
or
the
target
who
is
--
who
takes
his
privilege.
it's
only
the
potential
defendant
who
is
ever
immunized.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
absolutely.
otherwise,
the
--
our
whole
immunity
statute
which
provides
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
to
me,
it
means
very
little
with
all
due
respect
to
the
high
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
--
and
for
that
very
reason,
i
do
not
understand
how
at
the
one
hand
you
can
have
a
legislative
program
for
immunizing
potential
defendants
who
assert
the
privilege
and
on
the
other
hand,
say
that
they
can't
poss
--
they
can't
be
before
the
grand
jury
at
all.
i
think
that
really,
sensibly
speaking
all
that
steuding
holds
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
oath,
the
potential
defendant
receives
something
that
the
ordinary
witness
doesn't
receive
and
that
is
his
steuding
type
of
protection.
i
think
that's
the
only
way
that
it
can
be
read
and
it
says
that
that
is
derived
from
the
constitution
directly.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
theoretically
under
the
steuding
case,
i
should
think
probably
so
though
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
in
which
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
anyone's
that
fast,
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
steuding
protection
is
that
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
contempt.
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
forgery
because
the
oath
was
not
properly
administered
to
him.
his
testimony
cannot
be
used
against
him
in
any
future
prosecution
and
any
evidence
that
is
discovered
by
virtue
of
his
testimony
cannot
be
used
against
him
in
any
future
proceeding.
the
only
thing
that's
left,
the
only
area,
the
only
gap
between
the
steuding
protection
and
counselman
against
hitchcock
protection
is
that
he
maybe
pre
--
indicted
in
the
future
by
a
different
grand
jury
on
a
wholly
fresh
and
independent
evidence,
and
that
in
effect
did
happen
in
the
steuding
case
and
was
upheld.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir.
i
would
say
that
he
is
put
in
the
position
as
though
he
had
never
testified
at
all.
he
must
be
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
know
that
it
was
that
explicit
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
it's
subject
to
any
other
construction.
i
think
that
the
--
there
is
only
that
--
in
fact,
the
court
did
say
in
the
steuding
case
itself
but
one
thing
we're
not
passing
on
here
is
whether
he
can
be
subsequently
reindicted
by
a
fresh
grand
jury
on
fresh
evidence.
and
then
in
the
subsequent
case,
they
did
pass
on
that
question
and
said
yes.
so,
that
seems
to
me
the
steuding
case
gives
protection
up
to
that
point
and
complete
protection
up
to
that
point
which
is
i
think
the
protection
which
was
sanctioned
in
the
murphy
case
when
you
have
a
cross
jurisdictional
question.
now
there
was
a
great
deal
made
during
the
oral
argument
and
in
the
brief
about
the
petitioner
here,
of
the
fact
that
the
district
attorney
somehow
during
these
proceedings
had
consistently
and
repeatedly
told
the
defendant
that
he
had
the
privilege
still
available
to
him
and
he
uses
this
as
a
leaver
in
order
to
bring
the
raley
against
ohio
decision
to
bear
upon
the
case.
in
effect,
he
asserts
that
we
entrap
stevens
into
the
assertion
of
his
privilege
and
then
prosecuted
him
for
it.
i
think
this
is
based
upon
a
misconstruction
of
the
record.
and
again,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
facts,
the
procedure
that
is
followed
--
the
procedure
that
was
followed
here.
this
defendant
signed,
physically
signed
the
paper
that
is
called
a
waiver
of
immunity
before
coming
into
the
grand
jury.
this
is
customarily
done.
after
he
got
into
the
grand
jury,
before
he
was
given
the
oath
and
before
any
mentioned
was
made
at
the
waiver
of
immunity,
before
he
acknowledged
the
signature
under
oath,
he
was
asked
his
name
and
so
forth
and
given
instructions
by
the
prosecutor
giving
advice,
very
full,
very
complete.
he
was
told
at
the
outset
that
he
was
a
potential
defendant
and
he
was
told
that
as
a
potential
defendant,
what
he
said
could
be
used
against
him.
he
was
told
that
as
a
potential
defendant
he
had
the
right
to
assert
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
at
anytime.
that
is
the
language
which
he
relies
upon.
the
prosecutor
having
said,
you
may
assert
your
privilege
at
any
time.
but
mind
you,
it
occurred
prior
to
the
administration
of
the
oath
during
the
general
instructions
as
to
his
rights
that
were
being
given
to
him.
he
then
was
asked,
do
you
see
these
piece
papers?
you
know
what
it
is?
you
understand
what
it
means?
he
was
also
told
by
the
way
about
the
constitutional
provision
and
said
that
if
you
do
assert
your
privilege,
don't
sign
a
waiver.
you're
subject
to
forfeiture
of
your
job
and
was
shown
the
paper,
acknowledged
the
signature,
said
it
was
his.
he
said
he
understood
what
it
meant,
explained
to
him
again
and
then
he
was
given
the
oath.
it
is
--
the
reason
for
this
procedure
and
the
theory
behind
it
is
that
until
he
acknowledges
that
waiver
of
immunity
in
the
grand
jury
under
oath
that
it
is
not
an
operative
document
and
that
the
instructions
that
you
may
assert
the
privilege
anytime
mean
that
you
may
refuse
to
sign
the
waiver
and
refuse
to
acknowledge
it,
refuse
to
waive
your
privilege
before
this
party.
now
it
does
not
mean
that
having
executed
the
waiver
is
going
to
be,
you
may
withdraw
that
document
and
rely
upon
your
privilege.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
he
wasn't
told
explicitly
but
he
was
told
what
the
waiver
of
immunity
meant
and
what
the
waiver
of
immunity
meant
was
that
he
waived
his
immunity
and
therefore
--
and
that
means
he
waives
his
privilege.
the
statement
that
you
may
assert
your
privilege
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
your
--
i
dare
say
it
is.
i'd
see
if
i
can
find
the
precise
page
for
you
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
i
mean
to
proceed
at
this
point
to
the
merits
of
the
question
which
is
whether
or
not
the
provision
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
the
comparable
provision
of
the
city
charter
which
require
public
officers
as
a
condition
of
continuing
in
public
office
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
under
waiver
of
immunity
to
answer
questions,
bearing
upon
and
only
bearing
upon
their
performance
of
their
public
office.
it
has
been
argued
that
this
provision
provides
a
penalty
upon
the
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
has
been
argued
that
the
economic
consequences
to
a
defendant
who
does
assert
his
privilege
is
within
the
proscription
of
the
language
in
malloy
against
hogan
proscribing
a
penalty.
the
other
side
of
that
coin
and
i
think
the
more
proper
way
of
phrasing
it
is
that
the
economic
consequences
of
failure
to
waive
the
privilege
constitutes
a
coercive
element
which
interferes
with
the
exercise
of
his
free
will
and
that
free
will
being
necessary
to
a
valid
election
to
speak.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
a
penalty
taken
in
it
of
itself
within
the
context
of
the
fifth
amendment
undoubtedly
means
prosecution,
the
--
if
a
person
is
prosecuted
on
--
for
an
account
of
evidence
which
it
gives
then
the
fifth
amendment
is
violated.
a
penalty
does
not
mean
within
the
context
of
the
fifth
amendment
itself
simply
an
adverse
effect.
however,
if
the
word
penalty
is
read
together
with
the
sentence
in
which
it
appears
in
malloy,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
all
what
it
means
is
that
there
must
not
be
such
consequences,
such
penalizing
consequences
as
would
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
free
will.
the
issue
it
seems
to
me
can
be
phrased
and
should
be
phrased
in
this
manner.
does
a
public
officer
have
the
right
to
continue
in
that
office
free
of
any
regulation
which
comports
with
the
nature
of
his
job
or
is
he
subject
to
reasonable
regulations
and
expectations
which
do
reasonably
relate
to
the
nature
of
his
job
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
such
regulations
may
in
some
degree
encroach
upon
his
constitutional
privileges.
now,
this
court
has
stated
in
both
wyman
against
(inaudible)
and
of
the
(inaudible)
case
itself
that
if
a
--
that
a
public
officer
may
be
subject
to
reasonable
regulations
as
long
as
they
are
not
either
discriminatory
or
arbitrary.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
established
doctrine
of
those
cases
and
the
others
which
this
court
has
handled,
the
only
inquiry
here
is
not
--
whether
or
not
a
regulation,
the
requirement
that
he
testify
encroaches
upon
fifth
amendment
or
for
that
matter
new
york
state
privileges
against
self-incrimination
but
rather,
whether
it
is
a
reasonable
regulation
consistent
with
the
nature
of
his
duty.
it
is
our
contention
and
it
has
been
our
contention
throughout
that
it
is.
we
--
it
takes
no
great
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
realize
that
there
are
many
forms
of
public
employment
which
are
conditioned
upon
at
least
partial
relinquishment
of
constitutional
rights.
federal
employees
may
not
associate
themselves
with
others
in
certain
types
of
political
activity.
they
may
not
express
their
political
beliefs
in
certain
respects
and
still
be
public
employees.
certainly,
in
the
military
and
i
should
think
for
example
that
a
teacher
employed
by
a
municipal
government
who
insisted
upon
conducting
religious
services
in
her
classroom
in
the
exercise
of
her
freedom
of
religion
might
nonetheless
be
constitutionally
discharged
from
her
duty
--
from
her
duties
for
the
assertion
of
that
privilege.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
in
and
of
itself
either
shocking
or
repugnant
that
certain
forms
of
public
employment
have
certainly
reasonable
restrictions
upon
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights.
a
penalty,
the
threat
of
loss
of
a
job,
it
seems
to
me
cannot
be
taken
without
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
public
employment
which
is
to
be
forfeited.
a
police
officer,
indeed
a
public
officer
of
any
sort
is
responsible
not
only
to
his
superior
officers
but
is
responsible
to
the
community
at
large
who
are
in
a
very
real
sense,
his
employers.
no
one
i
don't
think
would
doubt
the
authority
of
the
police
commissioner
of
the
city
of
new
york
to
call
in
a
lieutenant
albeit
a
man
who
has
17
or
18
years
on
the
force
and
ask
him
the
question
which
was
asked
him
before
the
grand
jury.
have
you
taken
bribes
in
order
to
protect
gamblers?
i'm
sure
that
nobody
doubts
that
if
an
officer
elected
to
stand
on
his
constitutional
privilege
had
refused
to
answer
that.
the
police
commissioner
could
remove
him
from
his
office.
now,
whether
he
is
removing
him
from
his
office
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
assertion
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
or
whether
the
assertion
of
that
privilege
demonstrates
a
form
of
unfitness,
i
think
is
an
academic
question.
i
think
that
the
power
is
certainly
there.
now
if
the
police
officer
chooses
to
answer
the
question
and
thus
admit
--
answers
truthfully
and
thus
admit
that
he
has
done
certain
acts
which
would
subject
him
to
criminal
punishment,
i
don't
think
that
anyone
doubts
that
the
superior
officer
could
proceed
to
the
district
attorney's
office
or
directly
to
the
grand
jury
and
have
a
criminal
action
instituted
against
him
and
even
used
that
admission
against
him.
in
order
words,
a
superior
officer
does
not
have
the
power
to
grant
immunity
in
exchange
for
asking
the
officer
with
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now
the
real
question
here
it
seems
to
me
is
whether
or
not
the
situation
is
changed
by
the
fact
that
the
forum
changes.
and
the
police
officer
rather
than
being
before
his
superior
in
the
role
of
employee
if
you
will
or
at
certain
is
before
the
grand
jury
which
is
a
quasi
--
independent
quasi
judicial
party.
we
submit
that
the
situation
is
not
changed
at
all.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
a
special
relationship
between
the
public
servant
and
the
grand
jury
which
does
not
exist
between
private
individuals
in
the
grand
jury.
he
is
not
a
private
citizen
who
is
threatened
with
criminal
punishment
appearing
before
an
alien
body.
he
is
in
a
very
real
sense,
the
employee
answering
to
the
agents
of
his
employer.
his
salary
is
paid
by
the
community.
he
is
subject
to
public
scrutiny
for
the
performance
of
his
duty
and
indeed
this
relationship
is
recognized
by
a
statute
in
the
very
same
constitutional
provision
which
we
are
here
dealing
with
where
it
is
provided
that
the
grand
jury
does
have
special
powers
to
oversee
and
supervise
the
conduct
of
public
office.
consequently,
as
an
employee,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
can
expect
no
greater
benefit
from
the
incidental
fact
that
the
grand
jury
unlike
his
superior
officer
has
the
power
to
confer
immunity.
indeed,
the
power
to
confer
immunity
by
the
grand
jury
is
limited
to
certain
types
of
crime.
the
police
officer
who
is
called
by
a
grand
jury
to
answer
as
to
an
investigation
into
burglary
or
sale
of
narcotics
or
something
of
that
sort
could
not
receive
immunity
from
that
grand
jury
under
any
circumstance.
just
because
the
grand
jury
is
looking
into
bribery,
just
because
the
investigation
happens
to
concern
conspiracy,
does
he
thereby
obtain
benefits
which
he
would
not
merely
have
before
his
superior
officer?
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
so
mr.
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
what
i'm
saying
is
wrong
justice
stewart
then
he
would.
but
what
i'm
saying
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right,
precisely.
precisely.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
that's
--
there's
no
doubt
that
stevens
have
that
right.
stevens
could've
refused
to
sign
his
waiver
of
immunity.
he
was
told
he
couldn't
refuse
to
sign
the
waiver
of
immunity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
but
the
real
question
here
is
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
exactly.
and
the
important
fact,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
law
that
says
what
the
employer
can
do
about
it.
the
law
says
the
employer
can
dismiss
him.
it
doesn't
say
that
he
shall
not
have
the
right
to
assert
it
whether
its
narcotics
or
anything
else.
it
says
what
the
consequences
are
and
i
suggest
that
particularly
within
the
framework
of
the
facts
of
this
case
where
it's
a
police
officer
involved
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
essence
of
his
part
either
to
conceal
evidence
from
a
grand
jury
or
to
attempt
to
shield
the
perpetrator
even
if
the
perpetrator
is
he
himself.
it
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
his
duties
as
a
police
officer.
now,
we
can't
prosecute
him
for
that,
we
don't
intend,
we
don't
try,
we
don't
want
to
prosecute
him
for
that,
but
we
do
say
that
the
constitution
in
giving
us
the
right
to
dismiss
him
for
that
is
not
in
anyway
act
--
an
unreasonable
restriction.
consequently
on
the
pure
question
before
the
court,
the
only
question
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted,
the
reasonableness
of
the
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york,
i
suggest
that
it
is
permanently
reasonable.
now,
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
positively.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
the
employer,
the
personal
employer
whether
it
would
be
a
private
or
public
officer
asks
for
the
answer
with
the
understanding,
i
presume,
that
if
he
gets
an
incriminatory
answer,
there
is
no
way
in
which
he
can
protect
the
man
from
use
of
that.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
not
know
--
that
is
the
same
as
the
waiver
of
immunity
it
seems
to
me.
in
other
words,
there
is
--
there's
not
such
a
thing
as
waiver
of
immunity
because
there's
no
immunity
that
can
be
given.
there
is
no
waiver
of
immunity
before
the
superior
officer.
but
there
certainly
is
no
immunity
either.
consequently,
when
he
appears
before
the
grand
jury
under
a
waiver
of
immunity,
he
is
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
he
is
when
he
appears
in
his
commanding
officer's
room
without
anything
because
in
both
instances
he
may
incriminate
himself
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
if
he
answers
questions.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir.
oh,
one
with
(inaudible)
--
before
the
same
grand
jury.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
he
wasn't.
what
happened,
mr.
justice
white,
as
i
recall
the
record
is
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
the
first
time
was
before
the
june
grand
jury.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
on
that
occasion
he
signed
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
then
he
came
before
the
july
grand
jury
and
he
not
only
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
before
that
grand
jury
but
announced
that
he
intended
to
attempt
to
nullify
or
attempt
to
withdraw
the
waiver
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
does
not
appear
from
the
record
but
i
suggest
that
this
was
a
continuing
investigation
involving
many
police
officers
and
under
those
circumstances,
it's
not
at
all
uncommon
to
have
more
than
one
grand
jury
investigating
the
same
incident.
and
indeed,
sometimes
when
a
second
grand
jury
is
called
in
when
it
becomes
apparent
that
the
investigation
there
is
an
enlargement
and
so
if
the
witnesses
are
repeated
before
a
second
grand
jury.
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
waiver
itself
was
not
unduly
coerced
because
the
requirement
of
the
constitution
under
which
it
was
signed
was
a
reasonable
restraint
then
it
would
follow
that
if
it
were
a
legally
operative
act
from
which
legal
consequences
flow,
it
could
not
be
thereafter
withdrawn.
i
suggest
that
the
ticket
of
entry
which
he
received
by
virtue
of
this
waiver
of
immunity
into
the
precincts
of
the
grand
jury
was
a
legal
consequence
of
significance
equal
to
that
which
an
ordinary
defendant
obtains
when
he
takes
an
oath
in
the
trial
on
his
own
behalf.
obviously,
there
is
in
no
way
in
which
a
defendant
once
he
takes
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf
can
“hope”
to
the
questioning
which
occurs
and
that
it
should
not
be.
he
has
--
as
long
as
the
waiver
of
his
right
to
remain
off
the
stand
without
adverse
comment
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
actually,
he
was
discharged
by
letter
the
day
or
the
day
after
he
refused
to
sign
the
waiver
of
immunity
before
the
july
grand
jury.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
second
appearance,
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
and
that
was
presumably
the
basis
of
it.
we
notified
--
we
notified
the
police
commissioner's
office
that
he
had
refused
to
sign.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
yes.
he
was
brought
before
the
grand
jury
and
also
refused
to
answer
question.
but
in
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
before
a
different
grand
jury
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap).
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
our
interpretation
of
it,
yes
sir.
now,
i
--
in
connection
with
that
discharge,
i
wish
to
make
it
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
stevens
calls
it
partial,
we
call
it
the
--
would
be
the
same
thing.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
we
mean
that
it's
only
a
waiver
of
immunity
as
to
the
question
concerning
his
public
employment.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
it's
very
broad
as
you
noticed.
it
is
a
waiver
of
any
and
all
benefits
he
might
otherwise
receive
on
account
of
anything
he
might
testify
to
and
i
construe
it
to
be
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
concerning
the
conduct
of
his
office.
that's
what
we
mean
by
limited.
but
i
construe
it
to
be
a
waiver
of
steuding
protection
and
a
waiver
of
immunity
under
2447,
counselman
type
of
immunity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no.
you're
quite
right,
it's
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
your
honor,
it
is
in
my
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
correct
but
i
think
it
should
be
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
explanation
which
was
given
to
him
at
the
time
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
(voice
overlap)
quite
clear.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
does
not.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
don't
have
any
full
evidence
rule
limiting
us
to
the
language
of
the
waiver
itself.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
it's
what
did
he
sign
and
what
have
he
acknowledged
before
the
grand
jury,
in
other
words,
the
meaning
of
this
was
quite
clearly
outlined
to
him
by
the
district
attorney
before
that
waiver
became
an
operative
act.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
there
shouldn't
be
no
doubt
about
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
mean,
210,
record
210,
page
10,
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
but
i
would
take
the
language
of
the
waiver
itself
in
conjunction
with
the
explanation.
unfortunately,
that
waiver
is
one
sentence.
it
runs
for
a
--
practically
a
full
page
of
the
record.
it
is
obviously
drafted
by
a
lawyer
in
a
statutory
language
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
before
we
find
the
defendant
by
the
waiver,
we
haven't
acknowledge
orally
the
import
and
significance
and
he
was
told,
do
you
understand
--
it
means
that
if
you
signed
the
waiver
of
immunity
which
requires
you
to
answer
questions
concerning
the
conduct
of
your
public
office
that
what
you
will
say
--
what
you
say
will
be
taken
down
and
recorded
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
so
that
it's
quite
clear
and
this
is
before
that
waiver
became
operative
and
binding.
at
this
point,
he
could
still
say
no
and
walk
out
the
jury.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir,
he
would
be.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
testify
mr.
chief
justice
but
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
testify
in
the
grounds
that
he
had
waived
his
immunity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
that
the
waiver
was
invalid.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
mr.
chief
justice,
he
certainly
would
have
received
immunity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
he
wasn't
told
that
he
was
receiving
immunity,
that's
correct.
but
under
our
statutes,
he
receives
the
immunity
whether
the
district
attorney
and
the
judge
is
mistaken
or
not.
he
was
told
that
he
was
not
receiving
immunity
but
that
did
not
mean
that
he
wasn't
receiving.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
is
a
--
there
is
some
state
law
mr.
chief
justice,
which
does
indicate
that
under
the
law
of
new
york
there
must
be
accurate
advice
given
as
to
the
significance
of
the
command
to
answer.
and
the
decision
there
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
people
against
de
feo.
in
that
case,
the
--
what
have
happened
was
the
--
during
the
early
stages
when
it
wasn't
quite
clear
to
anyone
what
2447
meant.
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
said
to
the
defendant,
“you
answer
the
questions
and
if
you
answer
those
questions,
you
will
be
immunized
against
the
prosecution
for
conspiracy
or
bribery.”
the
defendant
refused
to
answer
questions
and
was
held
in
contempt.
the
contempt
was
set
aside
on
the
ground
that
that
advice
was
inaccurate
that
in
point
of
fact
he
would
have
been
immunized
against
any
crime
which
he'd
given
an
incriminating
answers
to.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
the
advice
was
inaccurate,
he
couldn't
have
been
held
in
contempt
for
having
continued
to
refuse
to
answer.
that's
the
de
feo
case.
based
upon
that
case,
it
does
seems
to
me
that
there
is
some
state
law
in
new
york
which
does
require
accurate
appraisal
of
the
significance
of
the
immunity
conferred
on
the
extent
of
it.
but
i
do
also
suggest
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
a
federal
question.
and
that
if
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
courts
for
consideration
of
the
issue
which
is
now
before
this
court
that
the
court
may,
i
don't
concede
the
point
because
there
may
be
arguments
on
the
other
side
as
well.
but
the
court
may
feel
that
the
contempt
conviction
was
invalid
in
as
much
as
he
was
not
accurately
appraise
of
the
significance
of
the
immunity
under
de
feo.
now
i
can
report
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
confusion
in
new
york
as
to
the
significance
of
de
feo
but
it
does
seem
to
indicate
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
there
is
some
requirement
of
accurate
advice.
i
insist
that
this
is
not
based
upon
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it's
not
based
upon
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
whether
or
not
he
did
received
accurate
advice
and
whether
immunity
attaches
whether
he
receives
accurate
advice
or
not
or
whether
a
contempt
conviction
can
be
sustained
whether
he
receives
accurate
information
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
as
a
matter
of
local
law.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
of
course
the
appellate
division
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
i
don't
think
he
is
to
blame
for
it
and
i
don't
suggest
that
this
courts
of
new
york
or
the
lower
federal
courts
are
forever
precluded
from
reaching
the
question.
i
just
suggest
that
where
the
lower
court
relies
upon
a
decision
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
this
is
not
the
proper
time
for
litigating
the
issue
that
they
have
not
drawn
the
issue
into
question.
in
other
words,
what
do
we
--
when
we
talk
about
regan,
what
we're
really
concerned
with,
we're
not
concerned
with
whether
or
not
he'll
ever
have
an
opportunity
to
decide
whether
he
had
immunity
or
he
didn't
have
immunity.
we're
merely
saying
what
is
the
proper
time
for
deciding
that
question
and
i
suggest
that
there
are
many
interest
to
be
served
by
continuing
with
the
proceeding
under
way.
interlocutory
fields
are
generally
forbidden.
when
a
proceeding
is
under
way
such
as
a
grand
jury
investigation
is
extremely
difficult
to
hold
it
and
obtain
an
answer
from
the
appellate
courts
which
could
take
unfortunately
a
very
long
time
as
to
whether
he
had
immunity
or
he
didn't
when
in
the
point
of
fact
he
hadn't
answered
in
either
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
had
to
answer
in
either
case
whether
he
had
immunity
or
didn't
have
immunity.
that
is
the
rationale
underlying
regan
and
i
think
a
very
sensible
one
that
applies
here
too.if
he
had
--
if
he
--
a
prosecution
was
ever
brought
against
him
on
account
of
his
answers,
that
would
be
the
first
time
where
he
was
threatened
with
any
sort
of
harm
with
the
result
of
his
testimony
and
would
be
early
enough
for
him
to
litigate
the
question
as
to
whether
he
received
immunity.
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
or
to
find
out
whether
he's
guessing
right
or
guessing
wrong
as
to
whether
he
is
receiving
immunity
because
in
either
of
that,
he
has
to
obey
the
order
of
the
court
to
answer.
and
there
is
a
paramount
interest
it
seems
to
me
which
overrides
his
interest
in
knowing
whether
he
is
receiving
immunity
or
not
and
that
interest
is
to
continue
with
the
grand
jury
investigation
or
it
might
be
another
case
of
trial
which
is
actually
under
way
at
the
time.
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
that
every
time
the
person
was
ordered
to
answer
before
he
had
to
go
back
to
that
grand
jury
which
is
waiting
for
him
a
few
floors
below,
he
could
go
through
the
appellate
division,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
circuit
courts
and
back
to
this
court.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
its
--
well,
isn't
that
quite
right,
because
if
the
waiver
is
valid
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
if
the
waiver
is
valid,
he
certainly
has
no
more
privilege.
he's
waived
--
if
the
waiver
is
invalid,
he
has
to
testify
because
by
testifying,
he
receives
immunity.
and
if
he
receives
immunity,
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
in
the
future
and
his
privilege
is
lost,
the
grant
of
immunity
have
supplanted
it.
consequently,
i
think
judge
marks
saw
the
issue
precisely
the
way
i
am
arguing
it
now
even
at
that
early
date.
and
he
was
obviously
facing
that
reasoning
upon
the
regan
case
which
held
just
that.
now
having
relied
upon
the
rationale
of
that
decision
by
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
whether
the
issues
drawn
in
question
here
is
a
very
real
one.
this
isn't
the
case
where
the
state
courts
on
some
whim
or
on
a
refusal
to
face
the
question
had
refused
to
decide
the
federal
question
and
thereby
precluded
this
court
from
deciding
it.
this
is
a
case
where
in
good
faith
and
in
good
conscience,
very
imminent
courts
below
all
felt
that
they
were
on
safe
ground
in
accepting
this
court's
rationale
as
to
the
timeliness
of
the
challenge
to
the
waiver.
whether
this
waiver
of
immunity
is
coerced
will
be
litigated
if
this
defendant
is
prosecuted.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
210,
page
20,
yes
it
does
appear
there.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
is
the
one
and
only
waiver
that
he
signed
on
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
this
waiver
he
signed
before
the
june
grand
jury
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
grand
jury
that
resulted
in
his
discharge
was
a
different
grand
jury,
the
july
grand
jury.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
right
and
that's
why
he
was
discharged.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
he
did
not
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
he
was
held
in
contempt
for
his
failure
to
answer
questions.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
they
didn't,
no.
they
didn't.
he
was
discharged
for
failure
to
sign
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
was
discharged
for
failure
to
sign
which
is
not
before
this
court
as
mr.
gressman
pointed
out.
the
question
of
his
discharge

mr.

no,

mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
(voice

--
after
he
refused
to
sign
the
waiver
before
the
july
grand
jury,
he
was
brought
back
to
the
june
grand
jury
a
second
time
in
july

mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
one
is
2
--
well,
that's
--
no.
that's
the
one
conviction
in
the
case.
there's
no
other
conviction.
210,
the
one
that
--
i
do
think
210
and
290
is
one
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
he
was.
he
was
convicted
three
times
of
contempt
all
before
the
june
grand
jury.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
one
and
third.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
it's
still
the
same.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
the
only
grand
jury
before
which
the
people
ever
contended
the
defendant
was
compelled
to
answer
was
the
grand
jury
before
whom
he
say
--
signed
the
waiver
of
immunity
and
that
was
the
only
one.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir.
not
intentionally.
he
may
have
been
--
well
no.
he
never
would
have
been
granted
immunity
because
in
order
to
obtain
immunity,
you
have
to
answer.
he
never
answered
and
consequently
he
never
got
immunity.
but
had
he
answered,
he
would
have
been
granted
immunity
unintentionally
if
his
waiver
was
invalid.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
didn't
have
to
know
it
in
as
much
as
if
he
follow
the
court's
directions,
he
wouldn't
be
hurt
either
way.
again,
we
come
back
to
the
rationale
of
the
regan
case.
but
i
do
think
this
proviso
as
i
did
to
the
chief
justice
it
is
possible
that
under
state
law,
there
may
be
a
requirement
that
he
has
to
be
accurately
oppressed.
that
is
possible.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
that
refers
to
what
i
have
termed
here
this
afternoon
as
steuding
type
immunity
or
murphy
against
the
waterfront
type
of
immunity.
in
other
words,
it's
not
counselman
against
hitchcock
immunity
and
it
is
not
complete
immunity.
it
is
not
the
type
of
immunity
that
will
replace
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
because
it
does
leave
the
possibility
of
prosecution
on
fresh
evidence.
what
it
is,
is
this
sort
of
limited
testimonial
protection.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir.
distinctly
no
(voice
overlap).
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
positively.
and
not
only
do
i
claim
but
in
so
holding,
the
court
below
specifically
cited
2447
and
2447
is
the
new
york
statute
by
which
complete
protection
against
any
future
indictment
or
prosecution
is
provided
for.
so
when
i
use
the
word
immunity
this
afternoon
so
there's
no
mistake,
i
mean
complete
immunity,
counselman
against
hitchcock
immunity.
and
if
i
mean
anything
less
like
in
laino
or
in
steuding,
i'll
try
to
modify
the
word
by
going
at
either
protection
or
unlimited
immunity
or
a
steuding
type
of
immunity.
so,
this
--
the
steuding
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there's
a
simple
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
i
think,
and
that
is
that
he
was
expressly
and
explicitly
told
by
the
judge
prior
to
being
held
in
contempt
for
the
first
time.
because
the
judge
told
him
at
that
time
that
this
case
was
indistinguishable
from
the
regan
case
and
he
was
represented
at
that
time
on
a
very
competent
counsel
who
had
cited
all
these
cases
to
the
court
and
obviously
know
the
meaning
of
regan.
and
the
regan
type
of
immunity
was
the
complete
immunity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
what
i
say
about
raley
mr.
justice
clark
is
simply
this.
raley
was
the
most
peculiar
case
and
indeed,
i
would
venture
to
say
that
the
case
was
sui
generis
because
if
you
recall
in
the
raley
case,
witnesses
before
the
state
investigating
committee
were
encouraged
virtually
to
assert
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
they
did
it
repeatedly.
it
was
always
clarified,
the
chairman
treated
them
very
graciously
indeed
and
there
was
not
one
word
said
to
anybody
at
that
time
to
indicate
that
this
privilege
was
not
available
to
them.
then
no
one
would
hold
that
after
they
deserted
the
privilege
all
this
time,
somebody
finds
out
that
there's
an
automatic
immunity
provision
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
that
they
were
compelled
to
answer.
they
didn't
have
the
privilege
at
all
and
they
were
all
charged
with
contempt
for
asserting
the
privilege.
and
well
that
seems
to
me
is
most
outrageous
sort
of
case
and
probably
sui
generis
and
this
court
seems
to
me
quite
sensibly
concluding
that
there
was
a
kind
of
an
entrapment.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
with
all
due
respect
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suggest
it's
exactly
the
contrary
because
what
is
he
being
told
there
in
effect?
he's
being
told,
you
don't
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he's
being
told
by
everybody
including
the
court,
“you
signed
the
waiver
of
immunity.
the
waiver
of
immunity
is
valid.
the
waiver
of
immunity
deprives
you
of
your
privilege.
you
can't
assert
your
privilege,
you
have
no
privilege.”
and
he
can
persist
in
asserting
it
and
he's
held
in
contempt
for
that.
there
was
in
the
one
case
that
he
is
told
he
did
have
the
privilege
and
punished
for
asserting
it
and
the
other,
he
is
told
he
didn't
and
was
punished
for
asserting
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
seems
to
me
its
quite
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
he
was
told
you
may
claim
your
privilege
at
anytime
but
if
you
sign
a
waiver
then
you
waive
your
claim
of
privilege.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
he
said
you
must
testify
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
he
did
say
at
the
time
the
waiver
was
signed
when
he
was
explaining
the
waiver
mr.
chief
justice,
that
he
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
that
only
occurred
one
other
time
and
that
was
before
a
different
grand
jury
where
he
did
claim
this
--
his
privilege.
he
wasn't
told
that
he
--
he
would
--
look,
that
is
a
correct
advice,
is
it
not
mr.
chief
justice?
in
other
words
the
(inaudible)
--
the
district
attorney
it
seems
to
me
is
obligated
to
tell
the
defendant
that
if
you
waive
your
privilege,
that
means
that
what
you
say
maybe
used
against
you.
now
we
intend
--
we
don't
intend
to
give
you
immunity.
we
want
you
to
know
that
you
are
a
potential
defendant
which
means
that
there's
a
likelihood
that
if
you
say
anything
incriminating,
we
will
use
it
against
you.
that's
only
fair
it
seems
to
me
to
the
witness.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
how
he
--
i
--
this
--
unfortunately
the
record
is
maybe
somewhat
ambiguous
but
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
mr.
chief
justice
indicates
that
what
he
was
doing
at
that
time
was
instructing
the
witness
that
he
had
a
right
not
to
sign
the
waiver
at
all
and
to
stand
on
his
privilege.
now
it's
true
he
said
at
any
time
but
if
you
look
at
the
context
in
which
at
anytime
occurs
before
he'd
ever
executed
the
waiver,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
what
he
meant
was
at
anytime
up
to
the
time
he
was
sworn.
you
may
refuse
to
come
in
here
under
a
waiver
and
stand
on
your
privilege.
that's
your
right
which
it
was.
and
in
assessing
whether
he
want
to
do
that,
i
must
tell
you
that
if
you
come
in
here
under
a
waiver
you
will
be
prosecuted.
now
there
maybe
a
slight
ambiguity
there
but
i
don't
think
it's
substantial
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
understood
it
full
well
because
on
the
subsequent
occasion
he
refused
to
sign
his
waiver
and
did
stand
on
his
fifth
amendment
right.
he
is
a
police
officer.
he
has
considerable
experience.
he
is
lieutenant
who
has
passed
two
police
examinations
to
achieve
that
rank
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
think
that
he
took
the
reasonable
explanation
of
it
and
did
not
think.
particularly,
he
said,
he
was
told
by
the
court
again
you
see,
before
he
was
held
in
contempt
the
first
time.
the
court
again
said
to
him,
you
don't
have
a
privilege.
now
you
answer
this
question.
he
could
not
possibly
have
thought
that
he
had
--
after
signing
the
waiver
that
he
still
have
the
right
to
assert
a
privilege
at
any
time.
i
think
that's
really
inconsistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
record.
thank
you.
