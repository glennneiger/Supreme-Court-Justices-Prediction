mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
connection
with
the
change
in
this
immunity
statute,
there
is
no
question
to
what
there
has
been
a
significant
constitutional
change
or
at
least
in
its
impact
the
--
this
court
as
stated
in
the
regan
opinion
itself,
recognize
that
a
change
had
occurred
but
that
it
was
not
applicable
in
that
case
because
the
operative
effects
in
regan
had
occurred
before
section
381
of
the
new
york
penal
law
had
been
amended.
and
--
but
the
change
is
noted
in
the
footnote
to
the
--
in
the
opinion
and
it
is
several
times
referred
to
in
the
opinion
that
it
was
critical
to
the
decision
in
that
case
that
the
immunity
statute
read
as
it
did
at
the
time
of
the
operative
effects
in
regan.
but
a
change
significantly
occurred
and
we
maintain
that
the
change
is
such
as
to
cause
that
the
regan
case
and
the
rationale
to
be
completely
inapplicable
because
no
longer
is
there
absolute
immunity
given
to
the
witness
called
before
the
grand
jury
that
the
--
under
section
381
has
amended
and
the
new
section
2447,
it
becomes
discretionary
with
the
grand
jury
whether
or
not
it
will
confer
immunity.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
is.
it
--
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
now
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
people
versus
laino
which
is
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
i
believe,
has
authoritatively
construed
this
change
in
the
immunity
statute.
and
is
--
did
so
in
this
case
--
in
these
words,
that
the
defendant
merely
by
testifying
and
that
is
what
regan
did
or
would
have
done,
did
not
--
does
not
receive
automatic
immunity
for
all
time
as
to
any
transaction,
matter
or
thing
revealed
by
him
as
he
would
have
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
2447
of
the
penal
law.
prior
to
section
2447
at
the
time
of
regan,
of
course,
in
a
conspiracy
or
bribery
case,
the
applicable
statute
provided
for
such
automatic
immunity
unless
the
witness
executed
that
waiver
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
this
(voice
overlap)
--
the
district
attorney
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
then
the
grand
jury
confers
--
says
(voice
overlap)
given
immunity.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
not
completely
clear
under
the
statute
but
just
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
let
me
go
ahead
with
this
brief
quotation
from
the
laino
case
which
goes
on
to
say
that
briefly
summarize
the
new
section
2447
provides
that
to
obtain
complete
immunity,
a
witness
including
a
perspective
defendant
must
one,
affirmatively
claim
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
two,
be
directed
or
ordered
to
answer
by
competent
authority
for
instance,
a
grand
jury
at
the
request
of
the
prosecutor
and
three,
testify.
mr.
eugene
gressman
now
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
the
court
goes
ahead
and
says
that
the
--
well,
you
would
have
to
comply
with
all
those
procedural
steps
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
in
order
to
get
complete
immunity
but
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
your
honor,
you
see,
all
of
that
is
premised
upon
the
discretion
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
prosecutor
to
go
through
those
procedural
steps
which
are
said
to
be
essential
to
the
conferral
of
immunity.
and
under
these
circumstances
which
we
have
detailed
at
lengthen
our
brief
in
which
are
evident
it
seems
to
me,
there
was
no
indication
that
the
prosecutor
or
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
if
stevens
had
gone
ahead
and
testified
would
have
conferred
immunity.
the
whole
idea
was
--
the
whole
atmosphere
was,
you've
waived
your
immunity
and
you
--
no
matter
what
you
or
anyone
else
tells
you
they
told
stevens,
you
have
no
immunity
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
no.
he
was
not
ordered
to
answer
pursuant
to
section
2447.
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
have
to
invoke
--
you
have
--
the
prosecutor
has
to
proceed
according
to
2447.
he
can
--
this
does
not
come
about
automatically.
it
has
to
be
done
knowingly
and
it
says,
unless
everyone
of
these
steps
is
pursued,
immunity
shall
not
be
conferred
on
any
person
except
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
section
and
there
must
be
this
explicit
request
from
the
district
attorney
to
the
grand
jury
to
command
the
grand
jury
--
or
to
tell
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
to
command
him
to
answer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
the
second
circuit
said
by
--
just
by
reference
to
this
provisions
and
incidentally
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
don't
believe
the
--
they
expressly
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
there
--
they
don't
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
they
don't
spell
out
that
he
--
the
fact
as
i
recall
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes
your
honor
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
we
feel
that
the
significance
given
by
this
court
in
the
regan
decision
itself
to
the
original
version
of
this
and
the
fact
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
says,
you
no
longer
get
by
virtue
of
the
statute
an
automatic
immunity.
you
see
in
regan
and
at
the
regan's
time,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
was
commanded
to
talk
or
not.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
not
the
function
of
the
new
york
court
to
declare
whether
immunity
has
been
established
or
not
here
because
the
procedural
steps
had
not
yet
occurred
and
this
is
precisely
the
reason
why
this
is
constitutionally
different
because
it's
not
up
to
the
courts
to
say
anymore,
the
new
york
state
courts
to
say,
you
have
automatic
immunity
because
you
are
directed
to
answer
or
because
you
claimed
your
privilege
because
it
have
to
go
through
the
precise
automatic
--
the
precise
discretionary
steps
that
have
been
outlined
in
the
new
section
4447
and
section
381
says,
“in
those
circumstances,
the
grand
jury
then
may
infer
immunity
if
it
so
sees
that
it
in
its
discretion
and
not
as
a
matter
of
automatic
immunity
attaching
by
virtue
of
the
statutory
command.”
mr.
eugene
gressman
concluding
my
references
to
the
change
in
the
immunity
statute,
i
would
like
to
summarize
the
change
in
this
sentence.
if
regan
had
gone
ahead
and
testified
and
the
waiver
were
later
bound
to
be
invalid,
there's
ab
--
there
was
absolutely
no
question
but
under
381
as
then
written,
he
would
have
been
assured
of
receiving
immunity
from
prosecution.
in
stevens'
case
on
the
contrary,
stevens
gone
ahead
and
testified
and
the
waiver
were
subsequently
found
to
have
been
in
--
and
legally
induced.
there
is
no
assurance
that
he
would
have
had
immunity
at
that
point.
it
would
have
been
depended
upon
the
discretion
of
the
district
attorney
and
the
grand
jury
as
to
whether
they
would
have
conferred
immunity
and
it
is
entirely
possible
that
in
their
discretion
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
they
would
not
have
bargained
an
answer
in
return
for
conferring
immunity
at
the
time
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
proceed
on
that
assumption,
yes
your
honor,
and
so
did
the
second
circuit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
would
in
--
only
in
this
sense
your
honor
if
that
were
the
only
decisive
difference
between
this
and
the
regan
case.
now
as
we've
developed
at
length
in
our
briefs,
there
are
other
distinctions
which
equally
distinguish
the
regan
case
and
one
is
the
entrapment
which
incurred
in
the
facts
of
this
case
involved
in
this
petitioner
before
the
grand
jury
for
having
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
--
i
think
is
true
your
honor,
yes.
that
--
but
that
never
occurred
here.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
that
must
be
implicit
and
necessarily
involved
in
this
new
statutory
scheme,
because
otherwise,
the
defendant
would
be
--
as
indicated
had
a
complete
loss
as
to
whether
he
should
answer
or
not,
“am
i
going
to
get
immunity
or
not.”
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
the
way
i
understand
the
whole
purpose
--
the
purport
of
this
statutory
scheme
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
just
as
broad,
yes
it's
complete
but
it's
discretionary.
mr.
eugene
gressman
there
has
to
be
something
to
that
nature
but
in
any
event
not
even
that
occurred
here
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
form
of
the
grand
jury
never
--
the
grand
jury
itself
never
commanded
him
to
answer.
he
was
simply
asked
a
question
by
the
assistant
district
attorney,
“i
declined
to
an
answer”,
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right,
in
10
new
york
2d.
mr.
eugene
gressman
ultimately,
it
was
to
--
from
the
judge
but
it
was
premised
on
the
same
theory
as
in
the
grand
jury
room
that
--
but
--
the
immunity
in
this
case
would
have
had
to
come
from
the
grand
jury,
not
from
the
judge.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
a
--
say
the
least
a
rather
complicated
opinion,
it's
not
entirely
clear
with
all
the
ramifications
of
it
but
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
seems
to
be
where
the
immunity
if
any
rest
upon
the
statute,
381
is
amended
in
2447
that
they
make
it
clear
that
unless
those
provisions
are
expressly
followed
and
procedurally
before
the
grand
jury,
no
complete
immunity
can
follow.
there
is
one
other
thing
i
would
like
to
leave
with
you,
your
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
even
as
the
amicus
brief
that
we
referred
to
earlier
points
out,
laino
was
subsequently
indicted
because
in
--
for
the
same
offense
because
a
complete
immunity
had
not
been
afforded
him.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
that
came
up
here
on
certiorari
and
was
denied.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
yes,
that
is
referred
to
in
some
length
in
that
amicus
brief.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
the
way
i
read
2447.
mr.
eugene
gressman
both
will
cooperate.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right
your
honor.
at
the
very
least,
you
cannot
say
with
assurance
as
you
could
--
as
you
said
in
regan
that
stevens
would
have
received
(inaudible)
complete
immunity
from
the
grand
jury.
that
--
and
that
assurance
was
what
--
was
the
predict
--
essential
predicate
of
the
regan
rationale.
i
would
also
like
to
leave
with
you
one
further
thought
in
distinguishing
the
regan
case
and
that
is
the
confusing
entrapment
to
which
the
assistant
district
attorney
put
this
petitioner,
having
told
him
that
you've
waived
immunity.
he
constantly
says,
“and
you
understand
that
any
time,
you
can
invoke
your
privilege
against
self-incrimination
under
the
united
states
constitution.”
and
when
he
proceeded
to
do
that,
he
then
found
himself
entrapped
into
a
contempt
citation
and
a
jail
sentence.
now,
we
maintain
that
under
the
similar
facts
and
decision
in
raley
v.
ohio
that
this
constitutes
an
unconstitutional
entrapment
which
was
not
involved
in
the
regan
case.
and
is
sufficiently
different
on
the
whole
factual
atmosphere
of
the
case
--
two
cases
to
distinguish
the
situation
here
from
that
in
regan
and
to
make
its
reasoning
inapplicable.
but
to
go
ahead
to
the
ultimate
constitutional
question
which
is
before
your
honors,
i
submit
that
the
combined
effect
of
the
state
constitution
and
city
charter
provisions
is
to
run
directly
contrary
to
the
principle
established
by
this
court
in
malloy
v.
hogan
as
applicable
to
states
to
wit
the
principle
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbids
the
states
to
resort
to
imprisonment
to
compel
him
to
answer
questions
that
might
incriminate
the
individual.
and
why
is
that
true
in
this
--
and
with
respect
to
these
two
provisions?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
lies
in
the
corollaries
to
the
basic
principle
which
were
recognized
in
malloy
v.
hogan.
the
first
of
which
is
that
every
person
has
a
right
to
remain
silent
in
the
unfettered
exercise
of
his
own
will
which
necessarily
implies
that
you
have
a
right
to
waive
your
immunity
in
the
unfettered
exercise
of
your
own
will.
and
the
second
principle
in
malloy
v.
hogan
is
that
the
individual
shall
suffer
no
penalty
or
burden
because
he
freely
elects
to
remain
silent.
now
here,
i
submit
that
both
of
those
principles
were
violated.
this
petitioner,
because
practically
at
the
invitation
or
the
advice
of
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
the
effect
that
he
had
this
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
because
he
exercised
it,
he
suffers
not
only
the
loss
of
his
employment,
contention
rights,
but
he
goes
to
prison
for
having
refused
to
answer
an
incriminating
question
in
reliance
upon
the
federal
privilege
what
the
prosecutor
repeatedly
said
was
available
to
him.
moreover,
and
perhaps
even
more
importantly,
the
impact
of
these
provisions
at
the
time
he
invoked
the
privilege
or
made
the
determination
as
to
whether
to
invoke
it
or
not,
completely
destroyed
his
unfettered
exercise
of
his
own
will.
the
choice
at
that
point
was
no
longer
whether
he
should
remain
silent
or
whether
he
should
speak.
the
question
was
--
put
to
him
in
these
terms,
either
you
waive
your
privilege
and
speak
and
incriminate
yourself
if
we're
right
that
there
was
no
complete
immunity
available
to
him
or
you
will
lose
your
job,
your
employment
rights
and
your
pension
rights,
and
in
addition,
you
will
go
to
jail
for
contempt
in
refusing
to
answer
an
incriminating
question.
now,
it
seems
to
me
obviously
that
that
time
of
a
choice
is
one
that
no
state
can
constitutionally
impose
upon
an
individual
when
confronted
with
an
incriminating
question.
it's
precisely
the
kind
of
an
unconstitutional
choice
which
this
court
referred
to
in
frost
against
railroad
commission
as
a
choice
between
a
rock
and
a
whirlpool.
an
option
to
forego
a
privilege
which
may
be
vital
to
his
livelihood
such
as
public
employment
or
to
submit
to
a
requirement
which
may
constitute
an
intolerable
burden
to
wit
waiving
an
immunity
and
incriminating
himself.
and
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
did
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
without
advice
of
counsel
and
did
then
to
the
pressure
of
this
choice
does
not
change
the
situation,
one
with
constitutionally
speaking
because
the
coercive
impact
of
this
upon
the
petitioner
was
nonetheless
obvious
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
took
the
choice
which
seemed
to
him
at
the
moment
to
be
in
his
best
interest.
but
it
was
nonetheless
a
choice
which
the
state
could
not
have
forced
upon
him
constitutionally.
and
the
result
of
that
choice
i
repeat
is
to
run
back
directly
to
what
was
outlawed
in
malloy
v.
hogan
that
he
has
been
imprisoned
as
a
result
of
making
one
of
these
choices
put
upon
him,
imprisoned
because
he
refused
to
incriminate
himself
and
relied
instead
upon
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now
what
justification
does
the
state
offer
for
this
illegal
choice?
they
say
various
things.
one
is
that
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
valid
condition
of
public
employment.
and
if
the
state
must
have
freedom
to
ferret
out
crime
among
its
employees
that
policemen
are
especially
obligated
to
cooperate
in
investigations
into
their
official
conduct.
but
the
critical
question
is
how
can
the
state's
interest
if
that
would
be
a
valid
interest,
be
manifested
under
the
constitution.
well,
i
suggest
that
if
that
interest
is
recognizable,
it
is
recognizable
solely
in
terms
of
the
employment
relationship
and
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case
whatsoever
your
honor.
in
answer
to
--
with
the
reference
to
the
chief
justice's
earlier
inquiry,
i
suggest
that
we
do
not
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
the
employment
forfeiture
and
discharge
of
this
petitioner
was
valid
or
not.
that
is
not
the
questions
involved.
these
are
solely
contempt
proceedings
and
if
there's
an
independent
proceeding
going
on
as
to
whether
the
employment
discharge
here
was
valid
or
not.
but
in
any
event,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
states
interests
in
--
and
in
waiving
--
having
the
employee
cooperate
is
something
that
can
be
exhibited
only
in
terms
of
proper
disciplinary
proceedings
involving
possibly
discharge
and
pursuant
to
due
process
requirements.
and
that
is
all
the
courts
have
ever
held
that
have
indicated
that
policemen
or
public
employees
are
under
an
obligation
to
cooperate
and
not
to
plea
the
fifth
amendment.
the
state's
interest
is
solely
in
terms
of
the
employment
relationship
but
i
suggest
that
the
state
cannot
exert
its
interest
here
in
such
a
way
as
it
has
in
this
case
so
as
to
destroy
the
public
employees'
privilege
against
self-incrimination
until
the
result
being
to
put
him
into
imprisonment
for
having
elected
to
remain
silent
in
the
face
of
an
incriminating
question.
but
the
fifth
amendment
put
it
differently,
said
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
there
is
no
exception
in
terms
of
public
employees
or
policemen,
and
so
that
no
more
than
an
employee
cannot
be
imprisoned
by
a
state
for
having
asserted
the
first
amendment
of
free
speech
no
less
should
a
state
would
be
prohibited
from
imprisoning
an
individual
and
a
public
employee
if
you
will
because
it
wants
him
to
incriminate
himself
and
that
he
has
relied
instead
upon
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
so
that
anyway
you
look
at
it,
these
provisions
get
back
to
the
principle
which
malloy
v.
hogan
and
prior
cases
that
long
since
established
that
the
state
simply
cannot
resort
to
imposing
such
a
choice
as
these
provisions
may,
a
choice
upon
the
individual
to
compel
him
to
answer
questions
that
might
incriminate
him
and
particularly
so
in
the
absence
of
an
absolute
automatic
immunity
statute
available
to
him
without
any
discretion
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
grand
jury
or
the
district
attorney.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
certainly
would
your
honor
but
i
think
there
are
other
differences
in
the
regan
case
that
i've
indicated
and
the
whole
of
constitutional
atmosphere
that
were
changed
that
was
brought
by
malloy
v.
hogan.
we
are
dealing
now
unlike
malloy
--
and
unlike
the
regan
case
we
are
dealing
now
with
a
privilege
which
is
federally
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
regan's
day,
it
was
not
protected
by
the
united
states
constitution
and
i
think
that
the
court
might
well
have
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
there
was
an
assumption
that
was
certainly
not
necessary
because
the
--
it
was
well
established
at
that
time
that
the
privilege
did
not
apply
to
state
proceedings
and
the
regan
case
itself
has
a
cf.
adamson
v.
california
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
first
paragraph
of
that
opinion
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
you
see,
regan
essentially
was
a
due
process
case
and
the
only
question
that
conceivably
have
been
involved
there
was
whether
the
proceedings
at
that
time
were
sufficiently
unfair
as
to
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process
in
a
procedural
sense
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
reference
to
any
federal
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes
your
honor
that
i
think
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
for
that
both
constitutional,
factual
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
the
state
law.
now,
it
may
be
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
every
--
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
the
--
both
the
appellate
division
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
both
made
flat
statements
without
really
examining
into
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
was
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
the
--
myself
that
the
--
as
far
precedent
is
concerned
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
the
laino
case
clearly
shows
as
authoritative
interpretation
i
think
is
--
as
we
could
want
that
the
automatic
immunity
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
pardon.
mr.
eugene
gressman
1962
i
believe.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
true,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
can
only
suggest
that
there
was
incomplete
analysis
of
the
problem.
there's
no
reference
in
any
of
the
opinion.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
there's
no
--
except
that
i
think
it
now
becomes
a
federal
constitutional
importance
and
significance
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
complete
immunity
available
under
a
state
statute.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
we
have
also
in
addition
of
the
various
factual
considerations
here
included
among
which
is
the
writ
--
is
the
statement
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
that
you
do
not
have
immunity.
and
we
have
here
a
factual
situation
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
under
the
laino
case
your
honor,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
district
attorney
must
and
is
the
critical
person
who
begins
to
put
in
the
operation
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
dis
--
must
respectfully
disagree
with
the
analysis
in
that
opinion
if
to
--
if
it
results
in
the
conclusion
that
there
is
necessarily
automatic
immunity
here
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
it
clearly
shown
in
its
laino
opinion
that
this
immunity
is
not
automatic
the
way
it
was
before
the
regan
decision
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
precisely
your
honor
and
they
must
go
through
the
procedural
steps.
there
are
three
or
four
of
them
mentioned
in
the
laino
opinions
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no
your
honor.
there
was
no
order
from
the
grand
jury
to
answer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes
your
honor,
it
would
here.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
the
court
magistrate
or
grand
jury
before
whom
the
proceeding
is
going
on.
and
the
proceeding
here
was
going
on
before
a
grand
jury
and
that
becomes
the
competent
authority
under
2447
to
confer
immunity.
mr.
eugene
gressman
oh
no
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
suppose
happens
all
the
time
that
that
--
that's
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
he
was
merely
implementing
the
power
of
the
grand
jury,
he
thought
to
compel
the
answer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
precisely
the
argument
that
that
kind
of
coercive
pressure
put
upon
him
even
before
and
he
thought
he
could've
been
given
about
immunity.
but
to
tell
him
to
--
that
even
before
he
went
in
the
grand
jury
room,
you've
got
to
sign
this
waiver
or
you're
going
to
lose
your
job.
you've
got
to
testify
or
you've
lost
your
job.
now
this
is
a
kind
of
choice
that
completely
destroys
the
essential
freedom
that
surrounds
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
what
--
whether
immunity
then
follows
or
not
it
seems
to
me,
constitutionally
speaking
is
irrelevant
in
these
peculiar
circumstances.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
should
--
what
be
construed,
your
honor?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
circumstances
under
so
many
variety
--
and
these
cases
replete
with
unusual
and
in
tracking
sort
of
the
factual
situations
here
that
make
it
unfair
to
say
the
least
to
force
this
man
into
prison
for
having
waived
the
privilege
which
was
--
surrounding
which
he
had
no
freedom
to
--
in
the
first
place.
and
secondly,
he
was
constantly
advised
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
that
you
can
invoke
this
privilege
at
anytime
despite
your
waiver
of
immunity
and
you're
not
going
to
get
any
immunity
in
any
of
that.
it
was
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
it
should
be
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
complete
combination
of
circumstances
i
think
here
are
more
than
adequate
to
completely
distinguish
the
regan
case
on
factual
and
legal
as
well
as
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
only
want
to
make
two
brief
remarks
in
connection
with
the
--
these
cases.
the
first
goes
to
the
point
your
honor
was
just
speaking
about
the
applicability
of
the
raley
case.
it
seems
to
me
the
longer
the
discussion
has
ensued
in
these
cases,
the
more
obvious
it
becomes
that
we
have
an
almost
exact
parallel
with
the
raley
situation
where
the
defendant
was
told
expressly
on
numerous
occasions.
on
almost
every
occasion
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
up
to
and
including
the
last
time
on
january
11th,
1965.
he
again,
as
repeat
--
is
repeated
to
him
referring
to
the
original
appearance
in
there
that
you
were
told
at
that
time
that
you
could
invoke
the
federal
privilege
against
self-incrimination
at
anytime.
this
was
repeated
to
him
on
the
second
occasion
when
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
as
well
as
at
the
first
time.
so
that
i
think
that
--
then
he
add
to
that
effect
that
the
immunity
possibilities
were
never
discussed
or
referred
to
by
the
assistant
district
attorney.
in
the
contrary,
he
was
told
expressly
that
it's
the
position
of
the
people
that
you
do
not
have
immunity
and
it
was
stated
to
him
that
you
can
and
will
be
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
any
incriminating
testimony
that
you
will
give
or
may
give
before
this
grand
jury.
then
we
find
subsequent
to
these
convictions
the
flat
statement
by
the
appellate
division
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
that
you
had
absolute
immunity
under
these
ambiguous
provisions
of
new
york
state
law.
that
is
exactly
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
held
in
raley.
after
they've
gotten
through
those
confusing
proceedings
without
any
reference
to
an
immunity
statute,
subsequently,
the
convictions
are
affirmed.
and
for
the
first
time
that
it
is
stated
affirmatively
that
the
raley
defendants
had
immunity
all
the
time.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i'd
--
there's
nothing
that
--
to
that
indication
in
the
record
your
honor
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
that
that's
a
legal
--
illegal
analysis
could
be
made
to
that
effect.
yes,
i
think
that
--
but
i
--
and
i
don't
think
the
raley
situation
was
one
of
legal
analysis
as
it
was
a
fairness
in
the
minds
and
in
the
treatment
of
the
witnesses
in
those
cases
and
so
here,
i
suggest
that
it's
not
a
question
of
the
legal
analysis
as
it
is
of
the
--
what
the
defendant
was
fairly
led
to
assume
what
was
available
to
him.
mr.
eugene
gressman
possibly
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
again
--
that
when
he
was
--
on
the
basis
of
his
third
conviction
in
the
third
contempt
that
occurred.
again,
it
was
then
repeated
to
him
that
he
had
the
right
to
assert
the
privilege.
so
while
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
again
as
a
matter
of
legal
anal
--
treatment
of
the
problem,
yes.
but
as
a
matter
of
practical
matter,
that
was
not
certainly
indicated
to
the
defendant
at
the
time
he
was
called
upon
the
third
time
to
answer
this
incriminating
question.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
the
assistant
district
attorney
here,
mr.
uviller
has
very
candidly
observed
and
properly
so
that
the
immunity
of
2447
does
not
operate
automatically
that
there
is
room
--
a
necessary
room
here
for
discretion.
and
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
he
conceded
that
the
district
attorney
did
not
exercise
a
discretion
to
bring
the
complete
immunity
under
2447
into
operation.
and
i
suggest
that
is
the
only
way
that
this
record
can
be
analyzed
and
the
only
way
in
which
this
immunity
problem
can
be
handled
that
it
was
not
an
automatic
immunity
and
if
there'd
be
any
question
as
to
it,
certainly
i
suggest
that
there
should
be
some
form
of
a
remand
to
the
state
courts
either
to
determine
the
extent
of
any
immunity
if
there
was
such
or
under
the
murphy
decision
to
have
a
completely
new
proceeding
before
the
grand
jury
in
which
the
rights
of
this
defendant
are
adequately
and
properly
and
fairly
explained
to
him.
and
you
will
note
at
the
very
end
of
murphy
v.
waterfront
commission
in
remanding
the
case
in
that
instance,
they
cite
the
raley
case
where
there
was
this
confusion
and
the
unfairness
which
certainly
has
been
exhibited
in
this
case.
thank
you.
