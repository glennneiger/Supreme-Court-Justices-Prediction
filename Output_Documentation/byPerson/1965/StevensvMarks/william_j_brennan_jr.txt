justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
mr.
schofield
that
the
immunity
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
of
regan
has
been
revised
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
amended
or
substituted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
say
it's
now
--
its
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
it
at
the
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
constitutional
is
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
constitutionally
is
the
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
association?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
have
any
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
gressman
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
does
--
why
doesn't
the
grand
jury
--
if
that's
it,
the
grand
jury
choice
is,
alright,
let
them
rest
on
this
subject
or
command
him
to
answer.
now
why
doesn't
the
command
to
answer,
why
isn't
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
which
carries
with
it
the
immunity.
i
don't
understand
that
the
grand
--
why
should
they
form
the
grand
jury
has
to
say.
i
command
you
to
answer
and
i
now
tell
you
by
answering
you
have
complete
immunity.
why
(inaudible)
was
permanently
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
order
here
was
from
the
judge,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
there
had
been
such
a
statute,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
gressman,
apart
from
this
argument,
do
i
correctly
understand
you
to
contend
that
the
constitutional
and
charter
provisions,
since
failure
to
waive
means
loss
of
a
job,
impose
that
kind
of
pressure
for
waiver
that
the
only
possible
consequent
constitution
if
there
is
no
waiver
and
the
privilege
you
derive
upon
it,
no
matter
what
they
say
about
we
give
you
immunity,
no
matter
what
they
say
about
that,
that
that's
the
kind
of
pressure
which
means
that
at
least
under
the
doctrine
in
malloy
and
hogan,
there
may
not
be
a
criminal
prosecution
or
even
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
followed
but
the
maximum
effect
could
be
the
loss
of
the
job.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
uviller
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
answer
mr.
gressman
just
gave
me
doesn't
indicate
that
what
you've
said
he
agrees
with
that
assuming
that
it
was
a
valid
waiver,
i
thought
his
whole
point
was
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
immunity
they
gave
him,
the
course
--
and
as
he
phrases
it
of
the
loss
of
job
which
invokes
the
waiver
in
it
of
itself
is
sufficiently
of
course
so
that
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
a
criminal
prosecution
even
a
criminal
contempt
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
if
that
that's
what
he
meant,
i
didn't
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
if
he
--
if
the
command
itself,
is
there
any
requirement
that
you
say
to
the
witness
and
that
we're
granting
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
says
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
told
that
that's
what
that
statement
meant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
told
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
that
means
he
waived
his
privilege?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
it
has
to
be
a
separate
waiver
for
each
grand
jury.
