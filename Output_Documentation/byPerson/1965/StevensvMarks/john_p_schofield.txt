mr.
john
p.
schofield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner,
james
t.
stevens,
was
a
lieutenant
with
the
new
york
city
police
department
prior
to
a
summary
discharge
on
july
15th,
1964
asserting
his
constitutional
privilege.
stevens
had
been
a
member
of
that
department
for
18
years
and
only
needed
two
more
years
for
retirement.
on
a
morning
of
june
26,
stevens
together
with
other
police
officers
with
summons
in
the
police
headquarters
and
at
an
office
of
the
deputy
chief
inspector,
they
were
all
handed
forthwith
subpoenas
to
appear
before
the
new
york
county
grand
jury
standing
there
or
sitting
some
three
blocks
away.
a
superior
officer
was
assigned
to
accompany
these
men
to
that
grand
jury.
when
they
arrived
there
at,
they
were
met
by
an
assistant
district
attorney
who
told
them,
he
wished
their
testimony
in
the
grand
jury.
however,
he
told
them
before
they
would
be
permitted
to
enter
that
grand
jury
they
must
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity.
he
stated
this
was
a
requirement
that
the
state
constitution
and
the
city
charter
required
of
each
of
these
men
if
they
wished
to
stay
on
the
police
force.
he
reminded
them
that
on
a
day
pervious,
ten
police
officers
were
summarily
dismissed
for
failure
to
sign
up
a
waiver.
he
also
told
them
at
that
time,
they
had
a
constitutional
privilege
not
to
incriminate
themselves.
however,
stevens
saw
fit
to
sign
that
waiver
of
immunity
on
the
advice
of
the
assistant
district
attorney
without
having
any
private
counsel
to
advise
him.
stevens
went
into
that
grand
jury
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
no,
stevens
didn't
but
several
other
police
officers
had.
but
stevens
made
no
mention
of
requiring
a
lawyer
or
ask
him
for
one
at
that
time
outside
that
grand
jury.
however,
when
stevens
went
into
the
grand
jury,
the
assistant
district
attorney
who
had
him
sign
that
waiver
outside,
now
for
the
first
time
told
stevens
that
he
was
not
there
as
a
witness
but
perhaps
as
a
potential
defendant.
he
then
had
stevens
identify
himself
and
state
that
he
had
signed
this
waiver
outside
and
he
understood
the
conditions.
stevens
gave
his
name,
rank,
command,
home
address
and
then
was
told
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
that
he
had
a
financial
questionnaire,
and
he
gave
it
to
him
and
he
told
him
he
would
be
called
at
a
later
date
before
that
grand
jury.
stevens
was
dismissed
from
that
grand
jury
and
it's
our
contention,
he
gave
no
relevant
testimonies
such
there's
no
question
as
to
what
statements
were
given
there
except
his
name,
command,
etcetera.
stevens
was
--
on
july
15th,
called
back
again
before
the
new
york
county
grand
jury.
however
this
time,
it
was
a
new
grand
jury
that
had
been
specially
impaneled
to
look
into
the
crimes
of
bribery
and
corruption
within
the
police
department
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
told
him
in
my
presence,
this
time
he's
represented
by
a
counsel
that
they
required
stevens
to
sign
a
new
waiver
of
immunity.
stevens
went
into
the
grand
jury
and
then
in
there,
informed
the
assistant
district
attorney
that
he
did
not
wish
to
sign
this
new
waiver
of
immunity,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
wished
to
recall
the
one
that
was
signed
on
june
26th.
the
assistant
district
attorney
admonished
stevens
by
telling
that
it
was
a
requirement
that
he
must
sign
this
waiver
or
he
would
be
summarily
dismissed
from
his
employment.
after
having
told
them
this,
he
told
them
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
exert
--
assert
his
privilege
and
he
could
at
any
time
invoke
this
privilege.
stevens
of
course
stated
these
--
stood
on
his
constitutional
rights.
he
was
dismissed
from
that
grand
jury.
however,
one
week
later,
the
petitioner
stevens
was
called
back
before
the
new
york
county
grand
jury,
this
time,
before
the
original
grand
jury
where
he
had
signed
the
limited
waiver.
the
assistant
district
attorney
brought
him
into
the
grand
jury,
asked
him
questions
and
each
question
was
responded
by
stevens
that
in
fact
that
he
stood
on
its
constitutional
rights
not
to
incriminate
himself.
whereupon,
after
refusing
to
answer
any
questions,
he
was
brought
up
before
a
new
york
county
supreme
court
judge.
he
was
commanded
by
that
supreme
court
judge
to
go
down
and
answer
the
questions
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
been
given
immunity.
at
this
point,
the
assistant
district
attorney
stood
up
and
told
the
judge
sitting
there
that
stevens
does
not
have
immunity
but
it
was
the
people's
contention
that
he
had
signed
a
good
and
valid
waiver
and
they
wished
him
to
speak
under
this
waiver.
the
supreme
court
judge,
charles
marks,
which
is
number
210
before
this
court,
told
stevens
to
go
back
and
answer
the
questions
when
he
read
them
and
he
specifically
asked
him
the
same
question
at
the
district
court
attorney
asked
him
in
that
grand
jury
and
that
question
is
this,
whether
or
not
stevens
in
the
five
year
--
last
five
years
had
accepted
any
moneys
from
bookmakers
or
policy
operators
to
allow
them
to
operate
violation
of
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
stevens
refused
to
answer
on
the
grounds
that
might
incriminate
him,
whereupon,
stevens
was
summarily
found
guilty
of
criminal
contempt.
counsel
at
that
time
asked
--
say
at
that
time
so
they
can
submit
written
memorandum
and
for
oral
argument.
judge
marks
consented,
however,
on
the
oral
argument
which
counsel
pointed
out
that
stevens
was
not
represented
by
counsel
that
the
waiver
was
not
a
good
and
valid
waiver
since
stevens,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
was
coerced
into
signing
that
waiver.
and
third,
the
fact
that
only
a
month
before
this
court
in
a
malloy
versus
hogan
decision
has
stated
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
now
applicable
upon
the
states
as
stevens
like
any
other
citizen
could
take
the
fifth
amendment.
however,
judge
marks
fines
stevens
some
$250
and
sentenced
him
to
30
days
in
jail.
he
did
get
counsel
time
to
apply
for
the
appellate
division
which
was
in
summer
recess
because
this
happened
in
july
to
stay
the
execution.
counsel
made
application
for
the
presiding
judge
of
the
appellate
division
for
refuse
to
stay
at
this
sentence
until
the
fall
term
on
--
the
appellate
division
would
come
back
on
th
ebench.
as
a
result,
stevens
went
to
jail
for
the
first
time
with
criminal
contempt
served
--
and
while
serving
by
the
way,
for
the
first
30
days,
counsel
made
application
in
the
federal
district
court
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
that
court
denied
the
writ
based
on
the
fact
that
stevens
had
not
exhausted
his
state
remedies.
therefore,
stevens
finished
serving
his
first
term
of
contempt.
soon
after
coming
out
of
civil
jail
and
paying
the
$250
fine,
stevens
was
again
subpoenaed
before
the
new
york
county
grand
jury
once
again
with
the
same
grand
jury
where
he
had
signed
his
coerced
waiver.
once
again
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
that
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
by
virtue,
it
was
not
a
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
not
only
a
dismissal
provision
which
was
coerced.
that's
exactly
right.
the
fact
that
the
pressure
was
on
this
man
that
i
don't
believe
was
a
free
and
voluntary
act
of
this
party
that
it
served
18
years,
leaving
two
years
for
retirement
which
faced
with
a
public
scandal,
had
seen
what
was
happening
in
the
newspapers
up
there
to
his
family,
his
wife,
etcetera.
he
felt
that
he
should
sign
it.
i'm
sure
that
was
the
pressure.
i'm
sure
any
public
official
faced
with
this
decision
whether
to
give
up
the
years
of
service
after
having
done,
i
think
almost
five
years
in
military
service
knowing
this
to
be
his
only
job,
he
signed
it.
i
don't
think
it
was
a
free
and
voluntary
act.
it
is
our
contention
that
it
was
coerced.
of
course
--
now,
he's
back
before
that
same
grand
jury,
he
is
asked
by
that
same
assistant
district
attorney
the
same
question
whether
or
not
for
the
last
five
years,
he
had
received
any
money
from
bookmakers
or
policy
operators.
once
again,
standing
on
his
constitutional
rights,
he
refused
to
answer
that
question.
once
again,
he
was
brought
up
again
before
the
new
york
supreme
court
judge.
this
time,
it
was
judge
weiser.
judge
weiser
commanded
him
to
answer.
he
refused.
judge
weiser
then
and
there
found
him
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
and
sentenced
to
begin
30
days
in
jail,
order
him
in
turn
--
30
days
in
jail,
fine
of
$250
or
the
alternative
to
do
another
30
days
in
jail.
while
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
alternatively.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
he
gave
him
30
days
in
jail,
a
fine
of
$250.
if
he
failed
to
pay
the
250,
he
would
do
another
30
days
in
jail.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
that
would
make
60
if
he
didn't
pay
the
money,
that's
correct
your
honor.
as
a
result,
before
this
mandate
was
now
signed
by
judge
weiser,
counsel
under
titles
28
--
u.s.
code
1443,
removed
the
proceedings
from
the
state
court
into
the
federal
court
claiming
that
stevens'
constitutional
rights
will
be
violated
by
the
state
court
and
an
application
of
course
was
brought
by
the
state
to
bring
the
case
back
into
the
state
and
that
federal
judge
then
and
there
from
the
bench
decided
that
we
came
too
late.
he
said,
the
man
is
already
sentenced,
i
do
not
have
jurisdiction
as
a
result
of
which,
stevens
case
was
transferred
back
from
the
federal
court
to
the
state
court.
stevens
started
serving
his
second
30-day
sentence.
while
in
jail
for
the
second
time,
the
appellate
division
came
down
and
denied
the
application
of
count
--
rather
denied,
made
decision
in
which
they
relied
on
the
regan
cases
controlling
and
stated
in
that
decision
that
they
were
not
entering
into
the
malloy
or
the
escobedo
case
as
far
as
the
constitutionality
of
the
questions
posed
by
counsel.
stevens
finished
serving
his
second
30-day
term
in
civil
jail,
paid
his
$250
fine
and
when
released,
found
himself
again
subpoenaed
before
the
same
grand
jury
now
for
the
third
time,
met
again
by
that
same
assistant
district
attorney,
again
asked
the
same
question,
again
brought
up
before
the
new
york
supreme
court
judge,
commanded
again
to
answer
that
question.
once
again
relying
on
his
rights
was
then
and
there
sentenced
now
for
the
third
time,
to
a
civil
jail
for
30
days,
fined
$250
or
the
alternative,
another
30
days.
it
was
pointed
out
to
that
supreme
court
justice
that
as
far
as
counsel
was
concerned,
this
has
not
only
became
double
jeopardy
or
triple
jeopardy.
it
was
also
pointed
out
that
supreme
court
justice
that
the
state
court
still
had
an
appeal
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york,
and
when
he
stay
the
execution
of
his
third
sentence
until
we
got
a
reply
back
or
decision
back
from
albany.
that
was
denied.
as
a
result,
stevens
went
into
jail
for
the
third
time.
while
stevens
was
in
jail
and
just
before
his
first
30-day
jail
sentence
run
out,
a
decision
did
come
down
from
the
court
of
appeals
once
again
relying
on
the
regan
case
and
this
time
counsel
now
having
exhausted
the
state
remedy
made
application
once
again
in
the
federal
district
court,
by
the
way
the
denial
by
the
court
of
appeals
makes
is
number
210
now
before
this
court
of
certiorari.
now
having
exhausted
our
state
remedies,
we
made
application,
federal
district
court
southern
district,
on
behalf
of
stevens,
judge
weinfeld
entertained
the
application,
allow
stevens
to
come
out
of
civil
prison,
he
is
paroled
of
federal
custody
without
opposition
from
the
district
court
attorney's
office.
however,
after
oral
argument,
judge
weinfeld
denied
our
application
but
did
say
that
it
was
a
--
issued
a
step
in
a
probable
cause
and
permitted
us
to
go
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
an
expedited
appeal.
we
argue
the
case
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
decision
was
--
once
again
was
rendered
against
us
and
at
this
time,
the
court
also
relied
on
the
regan
case
which
this
court
passed
on
1955.
of
course,
this
court
now
granted
certiorari
which
is
now
number
290
before
this
court
based
on
the
one
question,
whether
or
not
article
i,
section
6
in
1123,
the
new
york
city
charter
which
requires
that
public
officials
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
or
to
be
dismissed
from
their
job
from
not
signing
it.
i
have
the
wording
a
little
mixed
up
but
that's
--
in
that
sense
what
it
is.
what
happened
to
stevens
in
the
lower
court
--
excuse
me,
this
time,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
have
a
co-counsel
arguing
with
me
this
morning.
i
am
going
to
show,
i
hope
to
this
court
the
difference
between
the
regan
case
and
the
stevens
case.
my
co-counsel
will
take
the
constitutional
question.
since
all
the
courts
below
felt
that
regan
was
controlling,
i
would
like
this
time
to
point
out
similarities
and
of
course
the
differences
not
only
factually
but
legally
between
stevens
and
regan.
like
regan,
stevens
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
that
is
correct
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
attorney
--
if
we
look
at
the
brief
on
page
290,
page
16
--
excuse
me,
the
record,
i
said
that
the
--
i
meant
the
record
at
290,
page
16.
the
district
attorney
made
it
crystal
clear
the
position
of
their
office.
he
stated,
“and
do
you
understand
further
that
regardless
of
what
your
lawyer
may
say
or
what
anyone
else
may
say,
that
it
is
the
contention
of
the
people
that
this
is
a
valid
waiver
of
immunity
and
that
you
do
not
have
immunity?
do
you
understand
that?”
mr.
john
p.
schofield
that's
page
16
of
the
record
290
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
290.
it's
the
--
it
starts
with
the
second
sentence
there
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
--
with
the
questionnaire.
so
the
district
attorney
made
it
clear
that
stevens
do
not
have
immunity.
the
district
attorney
in
answer
to
your
question
your
honor,
with
reference
to
the
advice
he
gave
him,
also
made
it
very
clear.
if
we
look
at
the
record,
number
210
on
page
18
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
that's
now
--
we're
in
record
218
--
210,
page
13,
a
little
more
than
halfway
down.
this
is
when
stevens
appeared
on
the
--
before
the
july
15th
grand
jury,
the
chief
--
assistant
district
attorney
stated
this
to
stevens
when
he
is
in
the
grand
jury.
“well
now,
you'll
appreciate
that
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
city
charter
as
a
public
officer,
if
you
choose
to
retain
your
public
office,
you
are
required
to
waive
immunity
with
respect
to
the
matters
that
relate
to
your
official
conduct
or
through
the
performance
of
your
official
duties.
do
you
understand
that?”
answer,
“i
realize
that
sir,
yes.”
question,
“even
though
you
still
have
your
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination?”
“right
sir.”
“that
you
can
revoke
it
anytime?”
“right.”
mr.
john
p.
schofield
invoke,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
but
if
you
invoke
that
privilege
then
you
are
subject
to
the
forfeiture
of
your
position
as
a
public
officer.
stevens
of
course
said,
“i
realize
that”,
and
when
stevens
did
then
and
there
that
day,
refused
to
sign
that
waiver,
he
received
a
letter
terminating
his
employment
from
the
new
york
city
police
department
and
that
letter
in
that
sense
said
that
he
went
before
a
grand
jury
and
refused
to
sign
a
waiver,
his
office
was
terminated
and
his
ranked
as
a
lieutenant
was
vacated.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
yes
your
honor,
because
it
was
at
this
second
time
before
the
grand
jury
on
july
15th
that
he
asserted
that
that
was
when
they
want
him
to
sign
a
new
waiver.
so
that
he
had
actually
been
fired
on
july
15
which
the
letter
he
received
on
the
16th.
so
when
he
was
called
back
a
week
later
on
july
22nd
to
testify
under
this
question
of
his
immunity
that
he
signed
on
june
26th,
he
was
no
longer
a
member
of
the
police
department
according
to
that
letter.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
yes
your
honor,
we
have
an
article
78
pending
in
new
york
county
on
the
restoration
of
stevens
back
to
the
police
department
because
of
the
summary
discharge
and
denial
of
due
process
under
the
select
power
of
decision
from
this
court.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
that,
i
may
call
it
some
limbo,
in
as
much
as
the
cooperation
counsel
over
the
--
attorneys
for
the
city
of
new
york
in
their
answer
alleged
when
--
that's
what
happened
to
stevens
after
his
signing
in
the
waiver.
and
we
asked
to
how
this
taken
out
from
thereafter
on
the
grounds
that
this
happen
subsequent
to
stevens'
dismissal
and
had
no
pertinent
part
in
the
new
york
county
grand
jury
--
or
rather,
new
york
county
supreme
court
decision
then
and
there
before
that
justice.
however,
mr.
justice
hufstedler
denied
our
motion
to
strike
the
answer
which
showed
what
happened
to
stevens
subsequent.
as
a
result,
we
appeal
that
up
to
the
appellate
division
and
i've
--
since
this
court
did
declare
certiorari
where
keeping
in
a
limbo
area
hoping
that
this
court
resolve
that
and
it
will
also
resolve
stevens'
application
for
restoration
back
to
police
department.
however,
there
has
been
decisions
there
for
that
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
county
saying
that
they
amend
that
--
had
been
by
them
that
this
suit
be
restored.
they
were
told
to
have
an
involvement
hearing
before
summarily
dismissing
that
the
appellate
division
now
has
made
a
finding
as
against
the
city
for
dismissing
this
man
summarily.
now
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
i
would
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
yes,
i
would
say
so
--
yes
your
honor,
but
stevens
somehow
or
other
has
got
uniqueness
about
him
where
everything
seems
to
apply
to
everyone
else,
stevens
has
uniqueness
of
going
to
jail
for
three
times
which
never
happened
to
anyone
else.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
stevens
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
at
stevens
--
beside
that,
he
is
presently
under
indictment
now
even
while
he
was
in
federal
custody
under
this
third
contempt.
after
he
came
out,
a
federal
jurisdiction
took
place
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
we
argued
before
the
circuit
appeals.
they
subsequently
have
in
doubt
an
indictment.
and
the
first
three
counts
or
the
first
of
that
indictment
alleged
the
first
three
things
that
happened
here,
answering
the
same
question
each
time
as
for
basis
of
first
three
counts.
but
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
i
think
you
have
both,
your
honor,
before
this
court
because
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
validity
of
that
statute
in
line
with
this
court's
decision
in
malloy
has
allowed
to
stand
in
as
much
as
i
say
public
employees
have
the
same
rights
as
any
other
citizen
and
this
requirement
that
we
have
in
our
city
charter
in
the
state
constitution,
certainly,
is
a
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights
that
certainly
when
they're
faced
there
with
a
waiver,
it's
not
the
exercise
of
their
free
will
that
they
are
signing
this
waiver.
it's
in
their
position
put
upon
these
public
officials
by
the
state
constitution
and
by
city
charter.
and
as
a
result,
it
is
repugnant
to
united
states
constitution.
and
i
think
stevens
is
a
prime
example
of
what
happens
to
a
man
that
wants
to
assert
this
right.
he's
found
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
after
he
is
finally
advised
by
counsel
that
had
no
right
or
it
was
a
contention
that
counsel
had
no
right
to
assert
that
they
should
receive
this
waiver.
so
i
think
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
i
think
the
answer
to
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
either
one
--
well,
he
--
actually,
city
charter
follows
the
state
constitution.
and
the
answer
--
if
we
knock
out
them,
the
answer
then
would
give
us
an
answer
to
the
both
the
contempt
and
also
the
answer
to
the
summarily
dismissing
of
public
officials.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
right.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
yes,
i
think
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
well,
i
would
say
and
i'm
going
to
leave
mr.
gressman
for
his
oral
argument
on
the
constitutional
question.
i
don't
want
to
infringe
on
his.
i
would
say
this
that
new
york
procedurally
within
a
departmental
procedures
can
setup
rules
and
regulations
as
to
how
they
wish
to
conduct
of
their
public
officials
to
be
carried
on.
but
new
york
city
and
new
york
state
cannot
shave
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
it
was
stated
here
in
the
court
of
claims
--
rather
in
the
court
of
claims
and
cited
here
by
this
court
assert
the
decision
that
when
it
was
applied
to
a
federal
employee
who
was
looking
for
his
retirement
and
was
cutoff
in
a
steinberg
decision,
that
court
--
the
court
of
claims
said,
“congress
can
pass
laws
and
congress
can
repeal
laws
but
congress
even
with
the
expressed
permission
of
the
president
of
united
states
cannot
shave
the
constitution.”
and
that's
--
is
an
essence
what
the
city
charter
in
article
i,
section
6
of
the
state
constitution
is
known,
they're
shaving
the
constitution.
now
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
going
to
leave
more
of
that
argument
to
mr.
gressman
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
big
differences
between
regan
and
stevens.
regan
of
course
was
a
policeman
and
like
stevens,
he
signed
the
waiver
of
immunity.
however,
unlike
regan,
stevens
never
got
a
hearing
or
never
had
a
trial
as
to
whether
or
not
his
waiver
was
coerced.
everything
that
happened
to
stevens
was
summarily
found
guilty
of
criminal
contempt.
stevens
at
the
outset
raised
a
constitutional
question
but
regan
never
raised
it
until
he
came
here
for
certiorari.
most
important
though
is
the
question
of
the
immunity
statute.
at
the
time
of
regan,
we
had
an
absolute
immunity
statute.
that
was
not
the
case
in
june
26,
1964
when
stevens
was
called
before
the
grand
jury.
there
was
no
absolute
immunity
statute.
it
was
a
selective
type
of
statute.
more
to
--
in
essence
it
said,
the
district
attorney
may
confer
when
it's
explicit
in
the
record
here
that
it
was
never
his
intention
to
give
immunity
to
stevens
so
that
stevens
could
never
receive
the
full
immunity
bed
that
regan
had
at
that
time.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
alright.
stevens
never
answered
at
that
way
your
honor
but
stevens
at
all
times
answered
that
he's
been
on
his
constitutional
rights.
in
fact,
it
was
explicit
of
rights
of
the
fifth,
sixth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution
not
to
incriminate
himself.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
he
never
asked
the
way
your
honor
asked
that
question.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
it
was
neither
attended
to
him.
we
--
outside
the
grand
jury
in
conversation
with
the
district
attorney,
asked
him
at
many
times
whether
he
was
offering
immunity
to
stevens.
and
he
said
that
it
was
their
contention
that
they
didn't
have
to
and
he
made
it
explicit
in
the
record
that
no
matter
what
his
counsel
said
that
stevens
was
not
going
to
receive
immunity
by
any
immunity
statute.
in
fact,
if
there
was
an
immunity
statute,
it
was
an
anonymous
one
because
it
was
never
even
mentioned
by
the
district
attorney
at
anytime
when
stevens
appeared
either
in
the
court
or
in
the
grand
jury
that
if
he
answered
these
questions,
he
would
receive
immunity.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
oh
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
it
was
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
it's
a
selective
type.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
the
district
attorney
may
if
he
so
chooses
asked
that
immunity
be
conferred
upon
the
witness
and
he
can
--
then
asked
the
grand
jury
to
confer
it
and
then
he
--
the
grand
jury
then
commands
the
man
to
speak
which
was
not
the
type
--
same
type
of
immunity
that
was
present
at
the
time
of
regan.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
if
the
man
was
called
in
a
bribery
proceeding
and
he
was
commanded
to
testify,
he
automatically
received
it.
and
he
had
what
we
call
the
full
immunity
bed
at
that
time,
it
was
not
like
it
is
now
and
of
course
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
that
he
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
they
change
the
procedures
your
honor
in
2447
of
the
penal
code.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
well,
the
--
it
would
be
a
serious
question
if
counsel
were
to
allow
stevens
to
answer
and
have
that,
as
i
would
call
it
a
russian
roulette
game
whether
or
not
he
has
immunity
if
he
answers
because
it's
explicit
within
the
statutes
of
the
penal
law
that
there
are
certain
criteria
that
must
be
followed,
procedural
steps
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
at
one
time.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
that
was
at
--
in
the
time
of
regan.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
no.
now
the
district
attorney
must
state
that
he
is
giving
it
to
him.
he
must
go
to
the
grand
jury
and
tell
him
that
they
may
confer
it.
they
have
the
power
to
confer
it.
it's
a
power
that
they
may
or
may
not
confer
and
that's
the
way
it's
in
the
statute
and
that's
the
change
in
a
plea
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
no,
he
merely
didn't
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
not
--
plus
it
--
it's
whether
or
not
he
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
no.
he
--
it
must
be
told
whether
he
has
it
as
far
as
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
it's
in
the
20
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
it's
in
2447
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
and
i
believe
it's
been
pointed
out
in
great
detail
by
the
amicus
brief
by
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
on
page
7
your
honor
of
the
amicus
brief.
that's
the
white
brief
put
in
by
the
superior
officer's
counsel.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
no
your
honor,
it's
the
white
brief
which
the
superior
officer's
counsel
supported
our
contention
both
210
and
290.
it's
a
--
by
a
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
i
--
assistant
district
attorney
pointed
out
that's
also
in
page
5
of
their
respondent's
brief,
the
statutes
of
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
on
our
brief?
mr.
john
p.
schofield
actually
your
honor,
have
answered
that
question,
we
must
look
up
above
in
381.
at
381,
the
penal
law
states,
it
may
be
conferred.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
if
your
honor
please,
i
was
going
to
leave
this
to
mr.
gressman,
i
might
but
i
believe
it's
been
fully
answered
in
the
amicus
brief.
i'm
sorry
it
hasn't
been
distributed
and
i've
done
over
my
time
with
reference
to
that.
but
in
the
amicus
brief,
the
superior
officer's
counsel
had
answered
that
specifically
was
not
my
--
mr.
john
p.
schofield
yes,
yes
he
will
your
honor.
i
was
just
pointing
out
the
differences
and
i
believe
i
have
gone
into
the
various
differences
between
stevens
and
regan
with
reference
to
the
factual
and
legal
difference
of
course.
the
main
point
at
the
time
of
stevens,
he
had
the
advantage
of
the
malloy
decision
that
would
--
may
--
now
made
the
fifth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states
which
regan
did
not
have
at
that
time.
and
with
that,
i
want
to
turn
the
(inaudible)
over
here
to
mr.
gressman
going
to
the
constitutionality
in
question.
mr.
john
p.
schofield
thank
you.
