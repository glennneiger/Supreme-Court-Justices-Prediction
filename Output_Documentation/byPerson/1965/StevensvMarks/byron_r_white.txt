justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
it
really
requires
is
an
order
--
is
a
claim
of
the
privilege
in
order
to
answer
over
the
privilege.
that's
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
is
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
always
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
before
this,
he
didn't
even
need
to
claim
the
privilege,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
--
the
fundamental
thing
is
that
he
has
to
claim
the
privilege
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
plus
having
being
over
there
answered?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
provision
that
the
court,
grand
jury
or
the
--
or
the
court
has
to
tell
him,
we
are
granting
you
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
is
that
in
the
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
where
is
the
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
specific
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
this,
if
the
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
something
your
own
(inaudible)
--
that
you
give
on
page
7
doesn't
indicate
anything
in
order
to
answer
over
the
objective.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
before
it
even
says
how
it's
conferred
and
all
it
takes
to
confer
it
as
an
objection
in
an
order
to
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
mr.
gressman
going
to
touch
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gressman,
do
you
claim
though
that
he
has
that
--
well,
under
the
change,
he
must
claim
the
privilege
and
then
be
ordered
to
answer.
now
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
--
and
once
he's
ordered
to
answer
and
he
answers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
in
itself
is
a
conferral
of
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you
tell
me
some
case
or
some
provision
of
the
statute
which
says
anything
else
needs
to
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
there
is
to
it
and
immunity
follows
from
those
events.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
(voice
overlap)
occurred
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
was
asked
a
question,
he
claimed
the
privilege
and
he
was
ordered
to
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
(voice
overlap)
--
he
was
ordered
to
answer
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
having
the
state
court
said
--
held
in
this
case
that
he
really
did
get
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
appellate
division,
they
relied
on
regan
and
then
one
fundamental
legs
of
regan
as
you
say
is
that
he
obtained
immunity
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
appellate
division
decide
that
in
this
case?
that's
what's
the
opinion
says
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
denied
their
review
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
judge
weinfeld
certainly
thought
regan
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
cited
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
(voice
overlap)
the
new
york
courts
decided
in
this
case
that
the
events
occurred
which
would
have
given
him
immunity
since
the
new
york
courts
thought
that
regan
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
applied
and
covered
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
it
were
clear,
even
if
it
were
clear
here
would
you
say
it
isn't,
and
therefore
because
it
isn't
clear,
you
don't
ask
us
to
overrule
regan.
but
even
if
it
were
clear
that
there
was
immunity
here,
you
would
say
that
this
contempt
conviction
could
not
be
sustained?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
assume
that
the
court
didn't
agree
with
you
on
that.
that
if
there
was
immunity
here,
he
had
to
answer,
then
how
do
you
decide
--
where
do
we
look
to
decide
whether
there
was
immunity?
in
the
state
law
i
guess
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it's
clear
enough
here
that
we
could
just
read
the
state
law
as
contrary
to
what
the
implication
is
in
the
appellate
division
and
in
the
federal
district
court
that
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
the
events
here
did
not
result
in
a
--
in
the
grant
of
immunity?
we
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
we
should
do
it
on
our
own
here
to
say
--
either
say,
“yes,
there
was
an
immunity.”
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
laino
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
laino
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
was
before
the
court
--
the
federal
district
court
after
the
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
federal
district
court
thought
--
sought
this
case,
was
it
governed
by
regan
which
automatically
means
that
there
was
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
a
state
law
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
it
says
--
but
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
with
that,
its
federal
protection
on
the
privilege
but
it's
one
of
the
fundamental
legs
of
deciding
in
the
state
law
question.
did
the
state
--
it
was
under
the
state
statute
this
defendant's
granted
immunity
here
or
wasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
district
attorney
isn't
going
to
be
able
to
say
whether
there
is
or
isn't
immunity
if
the
statute
says
upon
the
happening
of
certain
events,
there
is
immunity
and
that
the
district
attorney
can
talk
all
day
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
weinfeld
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
weinfeld
knew
about
laino
and
he
didn't
compare,
he
agreed
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
that
at
least
--
the
very
least
the
new
york
statute,
the
new
form
it
means
is
that
the
prosecutor
or
the
court
or
the
grand
jury
or
somebody
has
supposed
--
has
to
intend
to
know
that
they're
granting
immunity
before
the
--
before
its
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
specific
steps
that
are
taken
there
were
pretty
well
satisfied
here
it
seems
to
me
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
had
to
be
from
the
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
381
says
the
--
says
the
court
magistrate
or
grand
jury
make
it
for
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
this
was
--
you
mean
it
was
improper
to
bring
this
man
before
the
judge
and
have
him
order
to
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
that's
the
proceeding
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
date
of
that
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
after
laino
or
whatever
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
he
--
wasn't
the
--
didn't
the
appellate
division's
decision
come
before
his
refusing
here
in
one
of
his
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
mr.
uviller,
i
thought
your
--
understood
you
if
the
waiver
is
invalid
then
this
defendant
shouldn't
have
been
before
the
grand
jury
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
someone
actually
physically
coerces
the
signing
of
the
waiver
of
immunity
and
he
was
taken
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
then
refuses
to
answer
and
he
is
held
with
contempt.
i
suppose
that
--
were
then
to
proved
that
the
waiver
was
invalid,
the
contempt
is
set
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
he
shouldn't
have
been
for
the
grand
jury
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they'd
have
to
give
him
immunity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
give
him
immunity
because
the
information
is
coming
out
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
they
are
two
different
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
the
chief
justice
saying
a
--
if
the
waiver
is
invalid,
he
didn't
need
to
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
--
if
it
--
assuming
an
invalid
waiver,
assuming
that
physical
coerced
or
something.
he's
before
the
grand
jury
and
he's
ordered
to
answer
and
he
says,
“no,
i
will
not
answer.”
if
at
that
point,
somehow,
a
--
you
could
have
had
an
appellate
ruling
on
his
refusal
to
answer
and
always
assuming
the
invalidity
of
the
waiver,
he
would
not
have
had
to
answer
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
he
should
have
been
before
the
grand
jury
at
all
in
your
state
law.
if
at
that
point,
you
could
have
had
--
had
the
--
had
somebody's
--
he'd
had
an
opportunity
to
say,
“now
look,
this
waiver
is
invalid,
you
know
it
is
and
i'm
not
supposed
to
be
before
this
grand
jury
at
all.
now
you
can't
make
me
answer
it.”
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
different
from
saying
if
he
had
answered
it,
he'd
get
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
although
he
shouldn't
be
before
the
grand
jury
if
somebody
--
if
some
judge
ordered
him
to
answer
nevertheless
be
put
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
--
so
the
idea
that
he
shouldn't
be
before
the
grand
jury,
doesn't
mean
a
whole
lot?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
theoretically,
under
--
you
get
a
writ
on
that
instead
of
prohibition
against
the
--
at
that
point,
he
can
run
out
of
the
grand
jury
room
and
get
his
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
never
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
in
that
--
you
equate
his
--
the
--
you
equate
the
privilege
of
the
employer
to
fire
if
he
refuses
to
answer
before
the
grand
jury
to
the
privilege
of
the
employer
to
demand
a
waiver
of
immunity
in
advance
before
he
knows
what
he's
going
to
be
asked
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
you
say
they're
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
practice
in
your
courts
up
there
that
one
waiver
covers
all
grand
jury
appearances?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
certainly
appears
in
the
record
here
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
second
appearance,
he
was
asked
to
--
again
asked
to
validate
this
waiver
he
had
signed
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
this
second
time,
they
say,
"are
you
willing
to
sign
this
waiver
of
immunity?"
he
said,
"no."
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
even
ask
him
to
sign
another
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
even
ask
him
to
sign
another
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
of
stevens'
discharge
and
when
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
was
after
his
last
--
oh,
after
his
second
appearance.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
also
because
the
--
he
actually
at
that
time
refused
to
answer
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
he
(inaudible)
tell
me
whether
the
waiver
is
denied
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
210
at
page
20?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
--
he
says
--
is
the
jury
appeared
before
--
the
next
time
with
a
different
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
didn't
sign
a
waiver
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
--
he
never
did
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
before
that
grand
jury,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
is
there
any
question
of
waiver
in
this
case
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
you
said
it
could
be
relevant
for
that
attempt
but
how
could
the
state
before
the
july
grand
jury
rely
on
his
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
never
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that
but
his
refusal
to
answer
the
first
time
he
was
convicted
for
contempt
was
his
connection
with
the
july
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
the
june?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
but
he
was
convicted
towards
retirement,
contempt
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
one
of
those
convictions
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
one
and
the
third
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
third
one
was
for
a
refusal
before
a
different
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
still
the
same
with
june
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
--
at
least
the
appellate
division
decision
intervene
between
his
first
conviction
and
his
third?
and
didn't
--
hadn't
the
appellate
division
then
at
least
as
to
that
later
refusal.
have
--
hadn't
the
appellate
division
said
flatly
that
there
are
--
as
you
say
flatly
that
there
was
immunity
and
didn't
--
didn't
he
know
then
he
--
at
the
least,
the
time
of
his
later
refusal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
the
new
york
court
had
said
he
did
have
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
if
he
had
the
right
to
assert
it,
there's
also
immunity
if
he
answers
them.
