justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
question
of
immunity,
suppose
it's
so
doubtful
that
even
this
court
can't
tell
whether
defendant
has
been
promised
immunity,
how
should
be
construed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
doubtedly,
you
argue
that
he
didn't
comply
with
the
steps
the
district
attorney
said
you
don't
get
it.
on
the
other
hand,
somebody
says,
"well,
technically
you
have
it."
now
what's
the
duty
of
the
court
in
determining
whether
a
man
can
go
to
jail
for
contempt
who
is
not
been
clearly
granted
immunity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
we
don't
have
to
assume
that
he
was
a
lawyer
and
could
decide
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
it
should
(inaudible)
it's
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
basis
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he'd
already
waived
it
though
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
already
waived.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
never
has
actually
been
granted
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
had
to
know
that
even
though
they
were
telling
we're
not
going
to
grant
it
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
never
have
fully
understood
either
your
view
point
or
mr.
gressman's
view
point
of
this
sentence
in
the
laino
case.
this,
however,
the
court
said
is
a
different
thing
entirely
from
a
complete
immunity.
reindictment
is
possible
if
sufficient
evidence,
independent
of
the
evidence,
links
or
leads
furnished
by
the
prospects
of
defendant
is
adduced
to
support
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
the
kind
of
immunity
you
say
he
would
obtain
if
he
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
(voice
overlap)
have
been
more
than
that.
