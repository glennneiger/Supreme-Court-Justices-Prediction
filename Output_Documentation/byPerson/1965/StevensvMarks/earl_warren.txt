mr.
schofield,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alternatively
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
give
him
30
days.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
that
would
make
60
instead
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
away
from
the
facts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
that
on
each
of
these
occasions
where
he
was
committed
for
contempt
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
told
him
that
he
was
not
to
receive
immunity
and
that
he
would
be
prosecuted
on
his
own
testimony
and
that
he
had
a
right
under
the
federal
constitution
not
to
testify
if
he
chose
to
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
invoke?
chief
justice
earl
warren
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
mr.
schofield,
what
if
we
ask
specifically
to
decide
whether
this
man
properly
lost
his
position
with
the
new
york
police
department
or
whether
he
can
be
punished
for
contempt,
for
refusing
to
answer
or
both.
chief
justice
earl
warren
must
he
answer
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
these
two
questions
separable
or
would
the
answer
to
one
carry
with
it
an
answer
to
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
either
one
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
overtake
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
we
were
to
hold
that
new
york
could
discharge
it
if
we
refuse
to
testify
concerning
his
conduct
as
a
police
officer.
would
that
necessarily
carry
with
it
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
punish
him
for
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
wouldn't
have
to
--
we
wouldn't
have
to
decide
that
independently.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
such
a
brief
--
there
is
such
a
brief
filed
here
but
for
some
reason
that
is
not
been
distributed,
it
was
filed
on
january
17th.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
gressman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
gressman,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gressman,
i
don't
want
to
take
much
of
your
time
but
do
i
understand
that
it
is
your
position
that
before
immunity
can
be
granted,
there
is
a
discretion
resting
in
both
the
grand
jury
and
the
district
attorney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
--
and
in
this
case
assuming
that
the
grand
jury
did
--
was
willing
to
grant
him
immunity
the
district
attorney
was
not
because
he
said,
"he
gave
warning
every
time
that
if
the
man
testified,
they're
going
to
prosecute
him
on
his
own
testimony,
and
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gressman,
because
our
questioning
deprived
you
with
your
five
minutes
that
i
know
you
want
to
reserve,
you
may
have
five
minutes
in
rebuttal
and
mr.
uviller,
you
may
have
extra
five
minutes
if
you
wish
it
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
uviller,
is
there
any
discretion
in
the
district
attorney
as
to
whether
a
man
will
get
immunity
for
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question
then.
was
--
whatever
the
discretion
the
district
attorney
have
in
relation
to
immunity
exercised
in
this
case
in
favor
of
granting
this
petitioner
immunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
will
--
he
would
have
been
immunized.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
we
find
that
under
this
new
act
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
was
that
under
the
old
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
that's
after
the
fact,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
uviller
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
validity
of
the
waiver
and
suppose
we
hold
that
he
had
a
right
to
withdraw
his
waiver,
would
he
then
be
entitled
to
immunity
in
this
case
or
would
be
in
--
he'd
be
entitled
to
exercise
his
constitutional
privilege?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
in
that
case
say
that
--
assuming
that
the
waiver
is
invalid,
would
you
say
that
the
district
attorney
had
followed
the
statute
and
the
grand
jury
had
followed
the
statute
in
order
to
give
immunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
steuding
type
of
protection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
the
fruits
of
his
testimony
be
used?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
court
--
has
the
court
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
uviller,
at
the
time
of
his
third
contempt
proceeding,
was
he
an
employee
of
the
city
of
new
york
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
i
suppose
that
that
proceeding
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
same
rights
as
any
other
citizen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
would
any
other
citizen
who
is
given
the
information
by
the
district
attorney
that
was
given
in
this
case,
would
he
have
been
obliged
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
immunity
had
been
accorded
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
that
this
waiver
was
invalid.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
assume
the
waiver
is
invalid
and
on
this
third
proceeding,
he
is
not
an
employee
of
the
city.
you
say
that
he
appears
then
as
a
--
as
any
witness
would
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
was
he
at
that
time
sufficiently
advised
to
give
him
immunity
under
your
statutes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that
isn't
the
--
that
isn't
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
man
have
to
outguess
both
the
district
attorney
and
the
judge
in
order
to
protect
his
rights
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
he
has
a
constitutional
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
he
raise
--
didn't
he
give
your
courts
the
full
opportunity
to
discuss
it
and
then
decided
it?
didn't
he
raise
it
in
--
from
the
very
beginning?
and
isn't
he
here
on
conviction
after
having
raised
the
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
to
blame
before
the
court
not
--
commenting
on
that
or
not
writing
an
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
point
of
fact
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
lower
court
held
that
whichever
way
he
decide
it
to,
he
was
in
trouble.
it
says
here
on
the
one
--
judge
marks
said
on
the
one
hand,
if
the
waiver
of
immunity
is
still
valid,
petitioner
no
longer
has
any
privilege
to
refuse
to
testify.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
doesn't,
he
has
to
testify
anyway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
although
it
is
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
assuming
the
stevens
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
get
some
kind
of
immunity
if
he
answered
the
questions,
how
would
he
know
whether
he
was
going
to
get
the
counselman
type
of
immunity
or
the
steuding
type
of
immunity?
and
would
not
that
make
a
difference
and
would
not
a
man
have
a
right
to
make
a
decision
depending
upon
whether
he
got
one
or
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
way,
we
haven't
--
we
haven't
got
somewhat
the
same
situation
here
because
repeatedly,
the
district
attorney
said
to
him,
“now
you
may
waive
your
--
you
may
waive
your
privilege
at
any
--
no.
you
may
claim
your
privilege
at
anytime
but
i
want
to
tell
you,
no
matter
what
your
lawyer
tells
you
or
no
matter
what
anybody
tells
you,
we're
going
to
prosecute
you
on
your
own
testimony.”
now,
if
you
testify
now,
isn't
that
just
about
as
strong
as
we
had
in
raley?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
depends
on
how
you
read
that
language
of
the
district
attorney.
as
i
read
it,
i
thought
he
said,
“now
you
may
claim
your
privilege
at
any
time
but
if
you
testify,
we're
going
to
prosecute
you
on
your
own
testimony
which
would
lead
the
man
to
believe
that
if
he
claimed
this
privilege,
he
wouldn't
have
to
testify.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
say
that
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
say
that
in
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
those
particular
--
he
might
have
said
it
at
one
time
but
he
didn't
say
it
in
all
those
statements
of
his.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
might
be
but
there
were
at
least
three
other
occasions
when
he
weren't
into
this
effect.
you
may
claim
your
privilege
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
if
you
testify,
we're
going
to
prosecute
you
and
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seemed
fair
to
me
too
but
i
wouldn't
go
on
and
tell
him
now,
you
also
have
the
right
however
to
claim
your
privilege
any
time
you
want.
now
what
does
he
get
from
the
claim
of
privilege
under
those
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gressman.
