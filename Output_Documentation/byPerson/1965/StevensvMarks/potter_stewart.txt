justice
potter

mr.
gressman,
if
it's
given
however,
it's
just
as
broad
is
it
not,
as
the
statute
provided
--
as
the
immunity
provided
by
the
statute
in
the
regan
case.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
the
--
your
claim
difference
in
the
kind
or
nature
of
immunity
in
this
case
from
that
which
was
conferred
in
the
regan
case.
as
i
understood,
let's
put
to
one
side
for
a
moment
the
statute
which
applies
to
public
officers.
let's
just
take
an
ordinary
witness
who
was
called
in
there.
now,
in
the
--
in
a
grand
jury
investigation
of
bribery
or
whatever
it
is
that
this
statute
covers.
he
is
asked
questions
by
the
grand
jury.
well
now,
he
hasn't
any
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
answer
those
questions
on
the
ground
that
they
might
incriminate
him.
and
the
grand
jury
might
be
sat
--
or
be
satisfied
with
that.
they
might
not
be
that
interested
in
his
testimony
so
then
he
doesn't
answer
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
in
order
for
them
to
compel
him
to
answer,
they
have
to
at
that
point,
tell
him
and
explicitly
tell
him,
do
they
not,
that
he
say,
having
conferred
upon
him
immunity
from
any
prosecution,
immunity
as
broad
as
the
constitutional
privilege,
that's
much
is
clear
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
forgetting
now
about
this
policeman.
we're
just
--
but
in
any
event,
before
he
answered
it,
it
would
occur.
he
would
know
one
way
or
the
other
whether
he
had
the
immunity.
if
he
didn't,
he
wouldn't
be
required
to
answer.
and
if
he
did
and
if
the
immunity
were
as
broad
as
the
privilege
then
he
would
be
required
to
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
so
he
could
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination
until
or
unless
he
was
given
immunity
as
broad
as
the
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
man
made
a
partial
waiver
of
his
immunity
which
he
--
which
you
say
was
coerced
and
which
you
also
say
he
later
withdrew.
but
in
any
event,
he
did
partially
waived
his
immunity
but
in
any
event,
he
could
refuse
to
answer
at
the
outset
and
then
and
only
then,
wouldn't
it
be
true
that
he
would
learn
whether
or
not
he
was
being
given
immunity
except
insofar
as
he
had
a
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
so
while
it's
not
automatic
as
it
was
in
regan
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
once
conferred
and
if
conferred,
it's
just
as
broad
as
it
was
in
the
--
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
grand
jury
were
as
you
suggest
looking
into
narcotics,
you
say
there's
no
provision
for
immunity
under
new
york
law.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
wouldn't
he
--
wouldn't
the
officer
have
the
simple
right
to
assert
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
not
answer
any
question?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
aren't
you
--
but
aren't
you
saying
that
much
but
then
you're
saying
that
he
could
be
dismissed.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
certainly
would
have
that
constitutional
right
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
--
i
begin
to
understand
that
you
apparently
have
various
grades
and
kinds
of
immunity
in
new
york
but
generally
speaking,
if
a
person
asserts
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
if
then
there
is
conferred
upon
him
immunity
as
broad
as
the
privilege
then
he
loses
his
right
not
to
answer,
does
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
a
narcotics
violation
since
there
is
no
provision
for
statutory
immunity
then
his
right
against
self-incrimination
remains
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
the
question
is
to
what
if
anything
can
the
employer
do
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
brought
back
before
the
june
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
con
--
where
is
that
conviction?
is
that
in
210
or
290?
