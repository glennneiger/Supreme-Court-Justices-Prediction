justice
abe
fortas
he
received
that
letter
before
his
first
contempt
conviction?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
would
that
indicate
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
further
administrative
proceedings
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
resiliently,
i
know
you
don't
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
does
sound
as
if
he
run
into
a
little
hard
luck.
justice
abe
fortas
did
stevens
base
his
refusal
to
reply
on
the
asserted
denial
of
immunity
or
put
it
the
other
way
around?
did
stevens
at
anytime
say
that
he
would
answer
the
questions
if
he
were
given
immunity?
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
knew
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
never
had
offered
--
never
said
that
he'd
answer
the
questions
if
he
were
granted
immunity.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
referring
mr.
gressman
to
the
laino
case?
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
--
yes,
that's
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
laino
case
seems
to
have
indicate
the
privilege
with
considerable
liberality,
wouldn't
--
would
you
disagree
with
that
characterization?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
laino
now.
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
the
least
arguable
that
in
laino,
the
court
of
appeals
have
indicated
the
immunity
even
though
the
procedure
there
had
not
been
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
followed.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
--
had
gone
with
the
court
--
appellate
courts
yet,
has
it?
justice
abe
fortas
the
subsequent
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
saying
if
i
understand
it
is
that
this
case
really
didn't
turn
on
the
--
whether
the
waiver
is
valid
or
invalid
with
respect
to
his
duty
to
answer
the
questions.
justice
abe
fortas
or
just
say
that
if
his
signature
to
the
waiver
was
valid
then
on
your
theory,
he
had
immunity
and
the
waiver
under
your
statute
is
not
just
a
waiver
of
immunity,
it's
a
waiver
of
the
privilege,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
he
would've
had
to
testify
if
the
waiver
was
valid
in
the
execution.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
waiver
was
not
validly
executed,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
he'd
still
have
to
testify
because
under
new
york
law
as
construed
by
the
steuding
case,
he
gets
the
immunity
anyway.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
by
this
very
case
and
sort
of
post
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
you
say
--
you
say
you
ought
to
have
had
immunity
anyway
so
he
had
to
testify
and
he
didn't
testify
and
therefore
his
conviction
is
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
whether
he
did
or
did
not
execute
the
waiver
of
immunity.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
saying
it
so.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
go
to
the
merits,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question.
i'm
trying
to
clarify
in
my
own
mind
the
precise
issue.
is
there
an
issue
between
you
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
as
to
the
effect
of
immunity?
let
me
put
it
this
way.
do
you
understand
that
petitioner's
counsel
intend
that
even
if
stevens
got
a
complete
immunity,
even
if
he
got
a
complete
immunity,
he
still
could
not
be
compelled
to
testify.
do
you
understand
that
to
be
their
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
contend
that
one
way
or
the
other
somehow,
someway
there
is
counselman
against
hitchcock
immunity
here.
it
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
waiver
is
invalid.
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
waiver
is
valid,
what
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
qualified
sort
of
second
class
citizen
immunity?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
why
is
the
state
interested
in
this
question
here?
this
is
referred
to
in
the
record
as
a
partial
waiver.
that
question
is
to
our
limited
waiver,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
which
do
you
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
right,
so
we
have
that
limitation
here.
justice
abe
fortas
the
second
thing
is
that
this
form
as
i
understand
it
on
page
20
of
the
transcript
of
record
is
a
waiver
by
stevens,
this
form
that
he
signed
whether
valid
or
not,
it's
a
waiver
by
stevens
of
his
immunity
from
the
prosecution,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
concerning
the
conduct
of
his
office.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
is
not
a
waiver,
it
does
not
purport
to
be
anyway
a
waiver
of
his
rights
to
refuse
to
testify.
i'm
talking
about
this
form
now.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
form
that
mr.
stevens
signed
did
not
purport
to
be
a
waiver
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
did
not
purport
to
be
a
waiver
of
any
right
that
he
might
have
not
to
testify,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
what
the
language
says.
justice
abe
fortas
but
we
have
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
gather
that
we've
got
an
issue
tendered
here
at
least
talks
about
as
to
the
effect
of
his
signing
or
not
signing
or
validly
signing
or
not
validly
signing
a
piece
of
paper.
when
i
look
at
that
piece
of
paper,
that
piece
of
paper
does
not
say
anything
about
a
waiver
of
his
privilege
against
answering
incriminating
questions,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
then
we
come
to
your
constitution
of
new
york
and
that's
where
i
find
a
provision
to
the
effect
that
if
a
public
officer
refuses
to
answer
a
relevant
question
with
two
parts,
one,
if
he
refuses
to
sign
the
waiver,
or
two,
if
he
refuses
to
answer
a
relevant
question
etcetera
before
the
grand
jury,
then
he
is
subject
to
dismissal,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
we
have
before
us
now
if
i
correctly
understand
it
is
the
contempt
punishment
of
stevens
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
before
a
grand
jury
and
he
refused
to
answer
those
questions
not
because
--
and
the
problem
there
arises
not
because
of
anything
in
this
waiver
that
he
signed.
justice
abe
fortas
but
when
a
man
sign
the
--
the
questions,
what
he
did
sign,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
saying
that
despite
the
language
of
this
or
in
addition
of
the
language
of
this,
stevens
has
to
be
held
on
the
state's
theory
to
have
waived
his
right
of
privilege
not
to
answer
and
not
to
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
that,
that
is
--
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
he
was
asked
or
whether
he
responded.
i'm
talking
about
whether
he
signed?
