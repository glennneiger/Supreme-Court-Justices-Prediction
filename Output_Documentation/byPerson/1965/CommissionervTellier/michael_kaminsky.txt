mr.
michael
kaminsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
commencing
on
the
argument
itself,
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
two
things
wrong
in
which
the
statements
made
by
the
representative
of
the
solicitor
general's
office.
the
first
thing
is
that
the
issue
of
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
is
definitely
not
in
this
case.
it
was
admitted
at
every
stage
below
that
these
expenses
are
the
proximate
result
of
the
taxpayer's
business
within
the
full
leading
of
kornhauser
against
the
united
states
and
bingham's
trust.
the
only
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
overriding
public
policy
which
operates
to
destroy
a
taxpayer's
right
to
a
deduction
which
he
would
ordinarily
without
any
question
be
entitled
to.
the
second
thing
that
i
should
like
to
say
to
the
court
is
that
in
this
very
recent
reply
brief
served
only
yesterday,
the
solicitor
general
seeks
to
prove
that
my
statement
that
since
the
time
of
heininger
and
up
to
the
time
when
the
commissioner
reversed
the
g.c.m.
and
substituted
the
revenue
ruling
that
he
has
followed
a
consistent
program
of
disallowing
these
deductions.
what
he
has
failed
to
tell
the
court
is
that
the
case
that
he
cites,
the
tax
court
case
green
motor
company
against
commissioner
5
t.c.
314
is
an
acquiesced
case.
now,
the
court
is
aware
that
the
position
of
the
commissioner
is
determined
not
from
the
overzealous
efforts
of
local
counsel
in
the
tax
court
but
by
what
the
commissioner
does
with
the
decision
when
it
comes
down.
it
happens
and
is
very
clear
that
in
this
case
the
commissioner
acquiesced
and
the
acquiescence
is
in
1945
(c)
(b)
page
3.
now,
the
bare
unvarnished
fact
is
that
this
acquiescence
could
not
have
occurred
had
the
revenue
ruling
been
in
effect.
have
the
revenue
ruling
been
effect
the
commissioner
would
have
been
obliged
to
non-acquiesce
of
the
case
and
take
it
for
appeal.
now,
the
reply
brief
always
also
cites
a
good
deal
of
what
the
late
judge
clark
used
to
call
the
chit-chat
in
the
decision.
it
is
very
true
that
the
tax
court
in
the
green
motor
company
made
all
the
statements
that
the
solicitor
general
says
it
did.
but
that's
not
the
ruling
of
the
case.
the
ruling
of
the
case
is
identical
in
longhorn
portland
cement
company
as
it
is
in
green
motor
company,
and
the
ruling
is
that
the
commissioner's
reliance
either
on
helvering
against
superior
wines
&
liquor
or
on
outdoor
advertising
is
misplaced
because
those
are
the
specific
cases
which
this
court
reversed
in
the
commissioner
against
heininger
when
it
grant
us
certiorari
in
that
latter
case.
now,
there
is
indeed
a
very
important
question
of
public
policy
in
this
case.
however,
it's
not
the
public
policy
question
that
the
solicitor
general
has
outlined
in
behalf
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
urges
this
court
to
disallow
attorney
fees
in
the
case
of
a
lost
criminal
defense
solely
for
the
reason
that
he
says
that
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
discourage
criminality,
to
discourage
the
commission
of
criminal
acts.
there
are
two
defects
of
that
argument.
number
one
as
this
court
has
said
in
commissioner
against
heininger,
there
is
a
complete
lack
of
direct
cause
and
effect
between
the
use
of
counsel,
the
employment
of
counsel
and
the
commission
of
illegal
acts.
and
second,
perhaps
even
more
important
is
the
fact
that
that
never
has
been
the
reason
for
the
rule.
now,
i
refer
the
court,
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
late
judge
learned
hand's
decision
in
rossman
against
commissioner
reported
at
175
f.2d.
711
in
1949.
in
that
case,
judge
learned
hand
referred
to
the
rule
which
had
existed
in
the
second
circuit
before
commissioner
against
heininger,
the
rule
that
disallowed
attorney
fees
in
civil
cases
where
the
defendant
was
employing
counsel
in
a
vain
effort
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
civil
fines.
judge
learned
hand
said,
“indeed
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
to
subsidize
the
obduracy
of
those
offenders
who
were
unwilling
to
pay
without
a
contest
and
who
therefore
added
impenitence
to
their
offense.”
and
for
this
reason
in
the
decisions
just
cited
we
held
that
such
legal
expenses
were
never
deductible.
of
course,
judge
learned
hand
also
hastened
to
add
that
this
court
in
commissioner
against
heininger
had
rejected
that
doctrine.
but
it's
the
great
merit
of
judge
hand's
decision
that
he
unabashedly
faced
the
real
purpose
of
the
rule,
so-called
rule.
the
real
purpose
of
that
rule
was
to
inhibit
the
use
of
counsel
in
an
effort
to
defend
against
charges
of
criminal
action.
now,
it's
unfortunate
that
judge
hand
--
mr.
michael
kaminsky
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
michael
kaminsky
yes,
your
honor,
this
was
a
civil
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
but
however,
the
facts
still
remains
that
judge
hand
unashamedly
faced
the
reason
for
the
rule
and
he
said
the
second
circuit
disallows
attorney
fees
because
we
want
to
discourage
the
employment
of
counsel.
now,
it's
unfortunate
that
the
late
judge
hand
used
the
word
subsidy.
he
said
that
it
would
--
he
said
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
to
subsidize.
but
the
label
which
judge
hand
used
is
of
relative
unimportance.
it's
a
relative
unimportance
because
if
it
is
a
subsidy
to
allow
a
deduction
where
a
defendant
is
successful,
where
a
defendant
is
not
successful
it
is
just
as
much
as
subsidy
to
allow
it
where
the
defendant
fails,
or
by
getting
it
twisted,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
defendant
has
succeeded
or
failed,
there's
a
subsidy
in
either
way.
and
the
bare
fact
remains
that
if
the
defendant
looses,
he
loses
a
subsidy,
if
it
is
called
a
subsidy.
so
it
makes
no
difference
whether
we
call
it
a
right
to
an
allowance
or
whether
we
call
it
a
subsidy,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
lost
a
case
in
court
and
causes
the
imposition
of
a
substantial
tax
penalty,
a
sanction.
now
that,
your
honors,
is
the
true
question
in
this
case.
the
true
question
of
public
policy
is
whether
we
have
reached
such
a
point
or
whether
the
mores
of
our
community
has
reached
such
a
point
that
we
are
going
to
penalize
a
man
because
he
has
failed
to
win
vindication
in
a
court
of
law.
i
think
that
this
court
answered
that
question
in
commissioner
against
heininger.
i
think
that
when
this
court
in
commissioner
against
heininger
said
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
statutes
for
which
the
defendant
had
violated.
it
was
never
the
purpose
of
those
statutes
to
deter
him
from
using
counsel
in
defense
against
such
charges,
this
court
meant
to
say
that
it
is
never
the
purpose
of
any
statute
to
deter
a
man
from
using
counsel
in
defense
whether
the
case
is
criminal
or
whether
the
case
is
civil.
certainly,
it
would
be
a
tremendous
inconsistency
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
when
a
man
is
charged
with
guilt
in
an
administrative
proceeding,
it
is
not
the
function
of
any
statute
to
deny
him
the
right
to
counsel.
but
if
he
is
charged
in
a
criminal
case
where
the
penalty
is
life
or
liberty,
if
he
fails,
he
fails
at
his
risk,
he
must
be
denied
the
right
to
--
he
must
be
denied
a
deduction
for
the
right
of
counsel.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
is
an
absolute
denial
of
his
constitutional
right
because
the
payment
of
the
tax
which
is
being
imposed
on
that
individual
constitutes
a
sanction.
he
would
have
that
deduction
if
he
were
successful.
he
does
not
have
that
deduction
simply
because
he
has
lost,
so
then
--
mr.
michael
kaminsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
--
it
is
our
position
that
when
this
court
decided
--
when
this
court
decided
the
case
of
gideon
against
wainwright,
the
case
in
which
this
court
said
that
no
jurisdiction,
no
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
a
defendant
unless
that
defendant
is
adequately
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
this
court
stated
a
fundamental
right
which
is
superior
to
any
statute.
no
statute
in
the
light
of
this
case
may
ever
take
for
its
purpose
the
deterrence
of
the
right
to
a
man
--
right
of
a
man
to
use
to
employ
counsel
in
his
defense
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
your
honor,
the
question
cannot
be
answered
simply.
cochran
is
a
burglar.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
if
cochran
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
burglarizing,
there
is
sufficient
reason
to
permit
him
the
deduction,
but
if
cochran
is
not
engaged
in
the
business
of
burglarizing
there
is
no
reason
to
allow
him.
but
the
answer
--
can
be
answered
no
in
this
way,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
your
honor,
does
not
gideon
say
that
the
united
states
government
must
subsidize
gideon's
defense
by
paying
for
his
counsel
if
he
has
none?
mr.
michael
kaminsky
yes
but
--
mr.
michael
kaminsky
gideon
--
mr.
michael
kaminsky
gideon's
offense
was
not
a
business
offense.
therefore
gideon
had
no
authority
under
the
statute.
but
the
distinguishing
feature
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
question,
but
that
these
deductions
arise
out
of
the
man's
trade
or
business.
we
have
no
difficulty
of
establishing
that
under
the
kornhauser
case.
we
could
not
establish
that
probably
in
the
case
of
gideon
and
we
certainly
could
not
establish
it
in
the
case
of
a
burglar.
but
in
this
case,
it
is
a
fact
of
the
case
that
this
man
was
engaged
in
a
business
which
the
government
said
violated
an
sec
regulation
and
the
government
convicted
him
on
that
and
destroyed
his
business.
no
different
than
in
the
case
of
heininger
where
the
post
office
said
that
dr.
heininger
was
violating
the
rules
of
the
post
office,
found
him
guilty,
and
destroyed
his
business.
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
burglary
your
honor
and
a
business
which
some
government
agency
says
violates
a
prohibitory
statute
enacted
either
by
the
state
or
by
the
federal
government.
and
that
your
honor
is
the
answer
upon
which
i
must
rest.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
yes.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
i
would
answer
your
honor's
question
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
deduction
but
for
another
reason
your
honor.
the
reason
being
that
since
the
government
taxes
him
on
his
profit
from
being
offense
as
the
court
puts
it,
the
government
has
no
right
to
tax
his
gross
receipts,
the
income
tax
law
permits
the
government
to
tax
only
the
net
income,
permits
the
commissioner
to
tax
only
the
net
income.
and
if
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
this
man
is
offense,
the
government
should
tax
his
gross
receipts
rather
than
his
net
income,
then
the
sanction
which
would
be
imposed
upon
him
might
be
tremendous
depending
upon
how
much
expenses
he
has.
and
nowhere
does
any
statute
of
the
united
states
say
that
a
man
should
be
punished
in
addition
to
the
punishment
which
is
imposed
by
the
crime
--
by
the
statutes
describing
the
crime.
he
should,
in
addition,
be
punished
by
the
disallowance
of
all
his
expenses
so
that
he
is
obliged
to
pay
a
tax
out
of
money
that
he
no
longer
has.
and
that
is
the
reason
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
taxpayer
is
engaged
in
an
illegal
business
is
not
relevant
to
the
matter
because
we
are
trying
to
tax
economic
profit
that
a
man
makes.
the
whole
theory
of
the
income
tax
law
is
that
the
government
will
share
the
profit
that
the
taxpayer
makes.
taking
a
certain
proportion
in
accordance
with
law
and
leaving
the
balance
for
that
man
to
spend
as
he
wishes
or
to
save
if
he
wishes.
now,
the
moment
that
you
disallow
expenses,
you
destroy
that
percentage
between
the
government,
and
if
your
honor
please,
i
could
give
you
the
illustration
of
a
man
who
pays
$100,000
for
stolen
cars,
sells
them
for
$110,000
and
if
the
commissioner
disallows
the
$100,000,
his
tax
would
be
52%
of
$110,000
not
$10,000
which
is
his
profit.
the
fact
remains
your
honor
that
the
income
tax
is
a
peculiarly
unfitted
law
for
the
punishment
of
crime
because
the
income
tax
law
does
not
punish
in
accordance
with
crime.
it
punishes
by
taking
that
which
does
not
exist.
it
punishes
by
taking
income.
now,
if
i
bring
the
case
down
to
the
particular
of
my
own
situation
here,
if
mr.
tellier
had
spent
$100,000
in
attorney
fees
to
save
his
business
having
received
only
$110,000
in
receipts,
if
we
disallow
the
$100,000,
we
bring
him
to
a
75%
price
on
a
$110,000
which
is
obviously
more
than
he
ever
had
in
his
life
out
of
that
business.
in
other
words,
the
penalty
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
crime.
moreover,
the
penalty
has
the
propensity
of
bankrupting
an
individual
depending
upon
how
large
the
expenses
as
being
disallowed.
now,
in
this
case,
mr.
tellier's
attorney
fees
in
1954
were
small.
that
doesn't
mean
they
were
not
larger
in
other
years.
the
fact
remains
that
if
we
disallow
the
attorney
fees,
we
have
created
income
and
having
created
income,
we
are
taxing
that
which
does
not
exist
and
we're
taxing
it
under
the
guise
of
a
penalty
to
prevent
this
man
from
doing
further
--
from
engaging
in
criminal
activities.
that
is
not
so.
we're
--
what
we
are
taking
from
him
is
his
right
to
be
defended
in
a
court,
because
we're
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
pay
for
attorney
fees.
if
a
man
who
has
received
$110,000
and
is
required
to
pay
$100,000
for
attorney
fees
is
denied
a
deduction
for
the
$100,000
he
simply
doesn't
have
the
assets
to
pay
the
attorney
fees.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
no,
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
i
believe
that
there
is
a
case
your
honor
where
the
commissioner
has
argued
that
any
relationship
to
criminality
makes
the
crime
--
makes
the
attorney
fees
nondeductible.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
my
honest
opinion
that
in
that
case,
he
would
allow
the
deductions.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
he
would.
if
you
have
went
to
counsel
and
you
asked
counsel
whether
an
act
was
criminal
or
noncriminal
and
you
were
advised
either
way
that
the
commissioner
would
allow,
because
the
rule
so
far
does
not
to
say
that
the
commissioner
won't
go
farther.
but
the
rule
so
far
is
that
only
the
attorney
fees
that
have
relation
to
the
particular
offense
and
it
is
not
yet
an
offense
when
you
ask
the
counsel.
you
asked
the
advice
of
counsel
whether
to
do
or
not
to
do.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
yes.
the
--
he
has
--
he
has
disallowed
the
cost
of
counsel
in
actions
before
the
internal
revenue
designed
to
prevent
a
referral
of
the
case
to
the
department
of
justice
for
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
michael
kaminsky
well,
not
yet
the
litigation
in
his
examination.
well,
the
special
agent
checks
on
the
case,
your
honor.
the
special
agent
has
within
his
power
