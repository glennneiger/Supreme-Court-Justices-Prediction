it
said
that
they
had
done
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
wasn't
cited
in
the
body.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
man
had
been
acquitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
have
to
be
a
concession
that
the
expense
is
ordinarily
unnecessary,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
you're
basing
it
purely
on
the
question
of
public
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
you
had
to
say
it
was
that
i
understood
you
to
say
if
he's
acquitted.
it's
deductible
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it's
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense,
it
shouldn't
be
deducted,
should
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he's
acquitted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
a
long
number
of
years,
certainly
29,
it's
always
been
an
argument
about
whether
courts
could
adopt
public
policy
to
require
people
from
getting
deducted
on
the
ground
that
that's
public
policy.
has
it
ever
been
presented
in
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
does
the
deduction
was
decided
to
be
taken
from.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
profit
--
is
it
profit
this
man
has
made
in
this
business
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
was
to
keep
the
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
talking
about
the
deduction
he
sought.
on
the
other
side
there
was
some
income.
where'd
that
income
come
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
but
did
--
didn't
the
crime
to
take
his
income
tax
on
the
grounds
to
violate
the
public
policy,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
neither
of
this,
so
far
as
i
recall
it,
referred
to
a
case
i
think
we
had
a
few
years
ago
from
north
carolina,
where
the
commissioner
declined
to
give
deduction
to
a
doctor
who
had
a
cutback
on
prescription.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
lilly.
