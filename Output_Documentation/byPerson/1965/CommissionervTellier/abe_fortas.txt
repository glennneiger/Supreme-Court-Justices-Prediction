justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you're
on
the
way
to
a
business,
to
a
friend
of
yours
to
plainly
discuss
the
business
and
he
had
an
automobile
accident?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
this
is
business
in
nature
if
it's
nondeductible.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show
whether
the
respondent
was
engaged
in
a
general
securities
business
or
was
this
an
isolated
transaction?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
was
only
part
of
his
securities
business
that
was
involved
here,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
unlawful,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
particularly
if
go
up.
justice
abe
fortas
now
on
page
5
of
the
government's
brief,
it
is
that
third
category
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
endorse,
is
that
a
correct
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
don't
have
to
mean
that,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well
in
fact
this
was
to
reflect
a
public
policy
in
contingent
fees
for
lawyers,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
lawyer
wins
and
the
client's
in
a
better
position
to
pay
him
the
fee,
but
the
lawyer
looses
and
the
lawyer
gets
penalized.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe
--
maybe
--
how
does
it
feel
about
the
converse
of
that
proposition?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
the
opposite?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
restate
what
--
that
last
sentence?
didn't
judge
hand
say
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
inhibit
the
employment
of
counsel
in
civil
--
in
cases
involving
civil
case,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
you
said
just
the
other
way
around.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
question
please?
justice
abe
fortas
in
taking
this
particular
case
and
making
the
assumption
that
the
respondent
was
advised
by
counsel
with
respect
to
the
securities
transactions
before
he
embarked
them,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
respondent
here
was
engaged
in
the
securities
business.
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
--
and
i'm
asking
you
to
assume
that
he
hired
counsel
to
advise
him
about
the
lawfulness
or
unlawfulness
and
the
form
of
the
transactions
that
were
subsequently
attacked
under
the
securities
act.
now,
does
the
commissioner's
theory
extend
to
the
disallowance
of
the
--
as
deductions
of
the
fees
paid
to
counsel
who
advised
respondent's
originally
as
to
setting
up
these
transaction.
justice
abe
fortas
you
suppose
the
lawyer
--
justice
abe
fortas
he
would?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
specifically
what
i'm
asking
is
whether
the
commissioner
has
extended
the
application
of
this
so-called
rule
beyond
counsel
engaged
for
the
litigation?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
litigation
connected.
