o.
douglas
the
settlement
of
those
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
they
cited
--
is
that
ruling
cited
in
your
brief?
i
don't
find
them
in
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas

know
but
i
thought
they
were
damage
suit,
weren't
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas

justice
william
o.
douglas

you

o.
douglas
