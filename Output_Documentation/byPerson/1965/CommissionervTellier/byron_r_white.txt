r.

well,
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
his
attorney's
fees
in
resisting
a
--
an
injunction
suit
and
attorney's
fees
for
defending
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
same
--
the
identical
transaction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
and
also
between
his
attorney's
fees
--
how
about
his

the

out?

r.
white
mr.
levin,
what
do
you
say
about
the
respondent's
argument
that
after
heininger
v.
commissioner
really
reversed
this
field
in
that
louisiana
1943?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
reading
of
the
law
until
'56
or
'62
was
just
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commissioner
asserts
that
regularly
in
'43
right
on
up
until
now
outside
the
antitrust
field
it
has
been
nondeductible.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
the
role
when
the
fit
to
foreclose
was
adopted,
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
commissioner
feel
--
the
commissioner
feel
--

that
g.c.m.
based
on
heininger
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white

on
heininger?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
felt
that
--
the
commissioner
felt
compelled
by
heininger
to
adopt
this
g.c.m.?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
antitrust
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
did
he
rely
on
heininger
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
concede,
you
mean
you
argue
that
it's
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
you
concede?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
you
--
but
now
you
--
the
solicitor
general
has
some

justice
byron
r.
white

position
now
is
that
it's
right?
