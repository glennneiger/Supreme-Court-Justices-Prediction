mr.
jack
s.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
income
tax
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
taxpayer
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense
arising
out
of
his
business
activities
may
take
a
deduction
on
his
income
tax
return
for
the
expenses
incurred
in
defending
against
the
criminal
prosecution
which
resulted
in
conviction.
respondent
was
in
the
business
of
underwriting
and
selling
securities.
he
was
indicted
in
a
federal
district
court
on
36
counts
charging
that
he
had
knowingly
and
intentionally
made
false
and
fraudulent
representations
which
induced
the
public
to
invest
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
an
insolvent
enterprise.
the
indictment
charged
violations
of
three
federal
statutes,
the
fraud
provision
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
the
federal
conspiracy
statute.
after
a
full
trial
to
a
jury,
respondent
was
convicted
on
all
36
counts.
the
judge
sentenced
him
to
four-and-a-half
years
imprisonment
on
each
count,
the
sentence
is
to
run
concurrently,
and
a
total
fine
of
$18,000.
in
connection
with
his
defense
of
this
criminal
prosecution,
petitioner
--
respondent
paid
his
attorney
approximately
$23,000.
this
case
concerns
the
question
whether
he
can
deduct
that
approximately
$23,000
from
his
other
income.
the
tax
court
following
an
administrative
and
judicial
rule
of
approximately
40-year
standing
disallowed
the
deduction.
the
second
circuit
en
banc
overruled
a
number
of
that
court's
prior
decisions
and
held
that
the
$23,000
incurred
in
connection
with
the
criminal
prosecution
was
in
fact
deductible.
the
governing
statute
in
this
case
is
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
which
is
the
general
provision
allowing
a
deduction
for
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business.
the
position
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
which
has
enjoyed
at
least
40
years
of
consistent
judicial
acceptance
both
in
the
trial
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
expenses
incurred
in
defending
against
a
criminal
prosecution
which
results
in
the
taxpayer's
conviction
are
not
deductible.
this
position
is
bottomed
upon
the
public
policy
expressed
in
the
statute
which
the
taxpayer
is
convicted
of
violating.
the
commissioner
in
the
courts
had,
at
various
times,
expressed
this
theory
in
a
couple
of
different
ways.
at
times,
they
have
said
that
the
expenses
are
not
ordinary
and
necessary
and
other
times
they
have
stated
that
the
expenses
are
nondeductible
because
they
violate
the
public
policy
expressed
by
the
state
legislature
or
by
congress
in
enacting
the
criminal
statute.
in
essence,
regardless
of
the
way
of
phrasing
it,
the
commissioner
believes
that
the
theory
of
nondeductibility
is
premised
upon
the
public
policy
ground.
that
is
that
congress
or
the
state
legislature
in
prohibiting
criminal
acts
could
not
have
been
intending
that
a
taxpayer
receive
a
deduction
for
his
expenses
of
resisting
a
suit
which
results
in
his
conviction.
in
this
case,
the
solicitor
general
in
the
brief
has
expressed
some
doubts
as
to
whether
the
public
policy
doctrine,
which
as
i
will
point
out
in
a
moment
this
court
has
accepted
in
other
contexts
in
tax
cases,
extends
to
the
disallowance
of
attorney's
fees.
however,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
declined
to
abandon
this
position
which
had
long
standing
support
in
the
cases
both
trial
and
appellate,
and
therefore,
the
solicitor
general
has
applied
for
certiorari
which
was
granted.
during
the
course
of
this
argument,
i
will
attempt
to
set
forth
the
reasoning
which
underlies
both
the
position
of
the
commissioner
and
the
solicitor
general.
however,
before
doing
that,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
two
preliminary
statutory
questions
which
i
think
will
put
the
public
policy
question
in
proper
perspective.
first,
section
262
of
the
internal
revenue
code
specifically
states
that
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
personal
expenses.
while
it
can
be
argued
that
the
expenses
of
attempting
to
avoid
a
criminal
conviction
and
possible
imprisonment
are
personal
in
nature,
the
commissioner
does
not
believe
that
this
case
can
be
disposed
of
on
that
ground.
in
a
number
of
cases
involving
the
deductibility
of
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
defending
civil
lawsuits,
this
court
has
recognized
that
whether
the
expenses
of
resisting
a
lawsuit
are
to
be
regarded
as
personal
or
business
in
nature
depends
on
the
type
of
activities
out
of
which
the
claim
arose,
rather
than
upon
the
consequences
losing
a
suit
would
have
on
the
taxpayer.
for
example,
if
the
taxpayer
engaged
in
the
business
of
delivering
packages
is
involved
in
an
accident
and
defend
the
tort
suit
arising
out
of
that
accident,
his
expenses
of
resisting
the
damage
claim
would
be
deductible,
because
the
origin
of
the
suit
would
be
his
business
activities.
whereas
if
the
same
taxpayer
was
on
the
way
to
a
cocktail
party
was
engaged
in
an
automobile
accident,
his
expenses
of
resisting
a
lawsuit
would
be
personal
in
nature.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
think
that
undoubtedly
there
is
--
there
is
room
here
as
in
most
other
tax
questions
for
argument
as
to
whether
the
activities
were
in
fact
personal
or
business
in
nature
in
closed
cases.
there
is
no
such
question
in
this
case
where
the
taxpayer's
activities
which
led
to
this
criminal
indictment
and
conviction
were
attempts
to
sell
security
which
in
fact
he
did
so
approximately
$700,000
or
$800,000
worth
and
received
commission
to
total
$540,000.
so
his
activities
which
gave
rise
to
this
lawsuit
were
clearly
business
in
nature.
the
question
--
undoubtedly,
there
are
cases
where
there
could
be
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
activities
were
sufficiently
business
in
nature
so
that
your
expense
in
resisting
lawsuit
would
be
business
rather
than
personal.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
and
we
take
that
position
not
on
the
ground
that
the
expense
is
personal
in
nature.
the
commissioner
concedes
that
in
this
case
the
expenses
of
resisting
a
lawsuit
are
business
in
nature.
the
second
ground,
the
second
statutory
question
is
the
meaning
of
the
words
'ordinary'
and
'necessary',
because
in
order
for
a
business
expenditure
to
be
deductible,
it
must
be
ordinary
and
necessary.
that's
the
statutory
language.
now,
this
court
has
interpreted
the
words
ordinary
and
necessary,
as
have
the
lower
courts
quite
liberally
in
order
to
effectuate
their
purpose
and
has
interpreted
them
to
include
in
general
any
expenditures
which
the
taxpayer
reasonably
expects
to
further
his
profit-making
purpose,
his
profit-making
business
purpose.
there
are,
however,
two
questions
which
arise
in
relation
to
this
ordinary
and
necessary
phraseology.
the
first
is
that
in
a
1940
opinion
of
this
court,
the
deputy
versus
du
pont,
which
the
commissioner
has
at
time
cited
and
which
the
lower
courts
have
also
cited.
this
court
used
language
to
the
following
effect.
and
he
said
that
in
order
for
an
expenditure
to
be
ordinary,
it
must
be
of
common
or
frequent
occurrence
in
the
type
of
business
involved.
now,
if
that
test
is
correct
and
if
that
is
the
law,
then
we
believe
that
the
expenses
here
in
question
would
have
to
be
disallowed,
because
as
i
just
stated
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
the
expenses
of
resisting
a
lawsuit
must
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
activities
which
gave
rise
to
the
lawsuit.
and
here,
the
expenses
of
the
lawsuit
were
occasioned
by
the
taxpayer's
criminal
fraud
in
his
securities
business.
and
since
criminal
fraud
is
certainly
not
common
or
frequent
in
the
securities
business
of
this
nation,
it
becomes
necessary
to
decide
whether
frequency
is
actually
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
phrase
'ordinary
and
necessary'.
as
spelled
out
in
more
detail
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is.
for
if
expenses
were
to
be
disallowed
whenever
the
activities
of
the
type
engaged
in
by
the
taxpayer
were
not
common
or
frequent
in
his
business
or
industry,
we
think
this
rationale
would
apply
in
cases
not
involving
criminal
violations
at
all
but
would
tend
to
discourage
business
initiative
and
innovation.
a
result
that
certainly
is
not
suggested
or
compelled
by
either
the
statutory
language,
the
purpose
or
the
legislative
history
of
the
relevant
code
provisions.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
record
is
rather
scanty,
your
honor,
but
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote,
the
second
circuit's
opinion
affirming
his
criminal
conviction.
and
in
that
case,
the
facts
are
set
forth
at
much
greater
length,
but
also
the
facts
in
the
record
are
also
ample
to
demonstrate.
the
taxpayer
was
regularly
engaged
in
the
securities
business.
he
employed
25
to
30
salesmen
who
were,
i
believe
from
the
record,
mainly
on
his
premises
making
telephone
calls
and
attempting
to
induce
costumers
to
purchase
securities.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
the
indictment
related
only
to
one
securities
issue,
to
one
company
for
separate
issuances
of
debentures
for
that
company.
taxpayer
dealt
mainly
in
securities
which
sold
for
under
$1
and
which
were
issued
principally
by
companies
which
had
no
earnings
record,
had
never
engaged
in
business
before,
new
enterprises.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no
sir,
it's
not
unlawful
at
all.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it's
--
it's
not
unlawful
at
all.
the
indictment
involved
for
issuances
of
debentures
by
an
alaska
telephone
corporation.
there
was
also
a
new
york
state
injunction
proceeding
which
is
reported
at
155
new
york
supp.
2d
245
involving
another
issue
of
securities
in
which
the
respondent
was
enjoined
from
selling
securities
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
five
years.
that
was
not
a
criminal
but
rather
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
the
commissioner
believes
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
commissioner
has
at
least
40
years,
consistently
taken
the
position
that
three
types
of
expenditures
are
encompassed
by
the
public
policy
doctrine.
first,
expenditures
which
are
themselves
illegal
such
as
bribes,
second,
criminal
fines
and
penalties
assessed
by
courts
in
punishment
for
criminal
acts,
and
third
the
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
resisting
a
criminal
prosecution
which
results
in
the
taxpayer's
conviction.t
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
has
doubts
as
to
whether
the
public
policy
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
that
third
category.
the
solicitor
general
has
expressed
no
doubts
and
in
fact
has
endorsed
the
application
of
the
public
policy
doctrine
to
the
first
two
types
of
expenses.
for
at
least
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
this
case
involves
solely
attorney's
fees
involved
and
incurred
in
resisting
the
criminal
conviction.
this
does
not
involve
either
one
of
the
first
two
categories
of
expenses,
this
case
does
not
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
solicitor
general
has
expressed
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
the
public
policy
doctrine
does
in
fact
extend
to
the
third.
he
set
forth
on
the
brief
at
length
his
reasoning
which
leads
him
to
conclude
that
he
acknowledges
serious
doubt
that
such
an
overriding
policy
in
favor
of
disallowance
exist
with
respect
to
attorney's
fees
in
this
sort
of
a
case.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
to
take
it
in
two
steps
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
i
don't
think
so.
let
me
just
take
it
very
briefly
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution
arising
out
of
personal
acts,
such
as
assault
and
battery
on
a
man
that
you
had
personal
distaste
for.
that
would
be
nondeductible
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
on
the
ground
that
it
was
personal
rather
than
business.
wherever
the
activities
which
gave
rise
to
the
criminal
prosecution
brought
a
profit-making
endeavor
or
out
of
the
business,
the
question
is
the
same,
then
the
question
is
whether
the
expenditures
will
be
disallowed
under
the
public
policy
doctrine
or
whether
they
will
be
deductible.
the
solicitor
general
has
expressed
serious
doubt
that
the
public
policy
doctrine
would
apply
here
and
in
the
case
that
you
hypothesized.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
the
solicitor
general
has
expressed
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
commissioner's
position
which
would
disallow
those
expenses
is
correct.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
40
years.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
when
the
case
reached
this
court.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
this
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
i
believe
to
the
extent
that
the
case
is
--
the
question
has
been
presented
to
them,
they
have.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
the
case
--
a
similar
case
was
before
this
court
once
before.
in
1943,
this
court
had
the
case
of
heininger
versus
the
commissioner.
there
the
taxpayer
had
incurred
attorney's
fees
in
resisting
an
administrative
fraud
order
issued
by
the
postal
department
banning
him
from
using
the
mails
in
his
business.
and
the
commissioner
and
the
solicitor
general
took
the
position
that
the
public
policy
expressed
by
the
postal
statute
there
in
question
prevented
a
deduction
for
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
unsuccessfully
resisting
this
fraud
order.
this
court
in
that
case
carefully
examined
the
postal
statute
in
question
and
concluded
that
the
statute
was
designed
solely
“to
protect
the
public”
and
that
it
was
not
designed
“to
impose
personal
punishment
on
violators”.
therefore,
this
court
held
that
heininger
had
not
been
judicially
determined
to
have
violated
a
criminal
or
penal
statute
and
that
his
expenses
were
deductible.
at
the
same
time,
this
court
expressed
in
a
footnote
the
following
thought.
a
taxpayer
who
has
been
hurt
and
prosecuted
under
a
federal
or
state
statute
and
convicted
of
a
crime
has
not
been
permitted
a
tax
deduction
for
his
attorney's
fees.
and
this
court
then
quote,
cited
the
decisions,
some
of
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
which
had
consistently
so
held.
thus
while
the
court
in
heininger
did
not
decide
this
issue
because
it
didn't
find
public
policy
had
been
violated,
it
observed
the
lower
court's
consistent
rule.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
said
that
the
lower
courts
had
done
it,
that
footnote
is
quoted
and
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
was
not
in
the
body,
in
the
footnote.
the
court
concluded
in
the
body
of
the
case
that
there
was
no
violation
of
public
policy,
therefore,
it
didn't
have
to
reach
the
question.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
we
filed
a
short
reply
briefly
which
i
think
adequately
covers
that.
it's
our
position
that
the
1944
g.c.m.
issued
by
the
commissioner
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue,
merely
created
the
temporary
and
erroneous
limited
exception
to
this
doctrine.
in
that
g.c.m.,
the
commissioner
said
that
a
corporation
which
incurs
attorney's
fees
and
resisting
a
criminal
antitrust
prosecution
may
deduct
those
attorney's
fees.
so
far
as
we
know,
that
g.c.m.
was
never
applied
outside
the
antitrust
area
as
quoted
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's'
correct.
we
cite
cases
in
our
reply
brief
which
so
hold
and
which
--
some
of
which
while
not
so
holding
so
state.
they
say,
“here
was
in
the
green
case
decided
the
very
next
year
in
1945.”
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
contend
--
the
commissioner
contends
that
the
--
for
40
years
consistently
since
the
20s,
he
has
disallowed
these
expenses
with
the
one
exception
that
from
1944
until
1962
when
he
revoked
that
g.c.m.,
he
was
allowing
deductions
for
criminal
antitrust
fees.
in
1962,
he
revoked
that
limited
exception.
we
think
that
the
reply
brief
adequately
sets
forth
the
cases
which
demonstrate
this.
mr.
jack

levin
based
on
what
your
honor?
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
do
not
believe
that
the
--
well
the
g.c.m.
does
cite
heininger.
it
does
cite
heininger.
mr.
jack

levin
well
i
find
it
difficult
to
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
just
what
the
commissioner
felt
in
1944,
but
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
he
cited
heininger.
it's
--
there's
a
discussion
of
heininger,
discussion
of
other
cases.
i
don't
think
the
g.c.m.
should
give
the
impression
that
heininger
was
controlling
but
now
solely
because
of
heininger,
this
has
changed
any
great
position.
we
now
concede
that
that
1944
g.c.m.
was
wrong.
it's
been
revoked,
it
just
widely
was
an
exception
created
for
attorney's
fees
and
antitrust
prosecutions
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
what
your
honor?
mr.
jack
s.
levin
we
concede
that
the
g.c.m.
was
wrong
in
creating
an
exception
for
antitrust
prosecutions.
but
it
should
not
have
been
deducted
--(voice

mr.
jack
s.
levin
when
i
said
we
there,
i
meant
the
commissioner.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i've
got
to
be
careful
with
my
use
of
the
word
'we'
it
sort
of
slips
out.
the
commissioner
believes
that
the
g.c.m.
was
erroneous.
the
solicitor
general's
position
of
course
being
far
broader
would
be
that
that
g.c.m.
was
right
and
should
have
been
much
broader
than
it
was
but
it
was
not.
the
solicitor
general
does
not
take
the
position
that
that
g.c.m.
was
broad.
he
also
takes
the
position
that
that
g.c.m.
was
quite
narrow.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
man
had
been
acquitted,
there's
no
question
but
that
the
attorney's
fees
would
be
allowed
as
a
deduction
because
they
arose
out
of
his
business.
the
commissioner
takes
the
position
that
when
the
court
determines
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
a
sharply
defined
public
policy
embodied
in
a
criminal
statute,
then
the
attorney's
fees
as
well
as
the
criminal
fine
which
is
paid
and
as
well
as
the
expenses
of
committing
the
illegal
act
are
nondeductible.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
is
based
purely
on
public
policy
whether
this
court
chooses
to
read
ordinary
and
necessary
as
in
themselves
embodying
a
public
policy
exception
or
whether
the
court
reads
public
policy
as
a
gloss
on
the
statute
which
congress
intended,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
court
has
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
because
the
man
has
not
been
determined
judicially
to
have
violated
a
sharply
defined
public
policy.
if
he
hasn't
violated
public
policy,
the
commissioner
will
not
invoke
public
policy.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
is
ordinary
and
necessary
in
the
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
is
ordinary
and
necessary
unless
some
concept
of
public
policy
which
congress
intended
to
be
embodied
in
that
statute
prevents
the
deduction.
now
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
position
would
of
course
have
to
apply
there.
this
court
has
held
that
the
expenses
early
held
--
that
the
expenses
of
an
illegal
business
are
just
as
taxable
as
the
expense
--
that
the
income
of
an
illegal
business
is
just
as
taxable
as
the
income
of
a
lawful
business.
and
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
the
--
in
the
sullivan
case,
the
expenses
incurred
by
an
illegal
business
are
just
as
deductible
as
the
expenses
of
a
legal
business.
mr.
justice
douglas
said
there
the
normal
expenses
of
an
illegal
business
are
deductible
such
as
rent
and
salaries,
but
we
contend
and
i
think
that
the
cases
certainly
bear
out
that
a
bribe
paid
by
either
a
legal
or
an
illegal
business
would
be
nondeductible.
attorney's
fees
would
be
determined
the
same
in
either
event.
if
this
court
holds
it
deductible
here,
then
i
--
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
that
they
would
most
likely
be
deductible
in
the
bank
robbery
case
where
the
man
was
in
the
business
of
doing
it.
now,
whether
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
it
has
been
inferentially
required
we
believe
by
congress
over
the
past
40
years
during
which
congress
has
frequently
reenacted
the
code.
this
court
as
well
as
the
other
courts
had
disallowed
certain
expenditures
violating
public
policy.
this
court's
decision
of
course
didn't
come
from
1958.
if
the
lower
courts
consistently
disallowed
the
three
categorical
sentences
that
are
illegal
payments
such
as
bribes,
criminal
fines
and
penalties
and
attorney's
fees
during
that
period,
the
code
was
repeatedly
reenacted.
the
general
words
ordinary
and
necessary
which
have
been
read
is
including
a
public
policy
exception
were
retained
unchanged.
in
fact
in
1958,
congress
adopted
a
new
section
--
subsection
to
162
the
expense
deductible.
it
said
that
the
expense
of
paying
bribes
to
foreign
officials
will
henceforth
be
nondeductible
and
the
committee
report
show
we
believe
that
congress
was
assuming
that
bribes
paid
to
domestic
officials
were
nondeductible
but
that
there
was
some
question
about
foreign
officials
since
they
didn't
--
such
bribes
didn't
violate
american
law.
so
congress
there
in
1958
was
quite
clearly
assuming
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
insistent
disallowance
of
such
illegal
payments
were
nondeductible.
in
the
same
year,
1958,
this
court
decided
the
tank
truck
case.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
had
repeatedly
been
convicted
of
violating
state
overweight
truck
laws.
and
the
case
did
not
involve
attorney's
fees
but
only
the
payment
of
criminal
fines
in
these
cases.
and
this
court
held
in
1958
in
tank
truck
that
criminal
fines
were
nondeductible
because
they
violated
public
policy
the
same
time
this
court
clearly
stated
that
payments
such
as
bribes
which
are
themselves
illegal
were
also
nondeductible
because
they
violated
the
sharply
defined
public
policy
embodied
in
the
criminal
statute
which
had
been
violated.
and
this
court
said
that
congress
could
not
be
presumed
to
have
intended
when
it
enacted
this
general
expense
section
to
allow
a
deduction
for
an
expenditure
which
was
intimately
related
o
a
criminal
act
in
which
--
but
only
if
the
expenditure
was
remote,
and
this
court
used
the
word
'remote'
from
the
illegal
act.
it's
the
commissioner's
position
here
that
the
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
a
criminal
proceeding
in
which
the
taxpayer
is
convicted
far
from
being
only
remotely
related
to
the
illegal
act
are
intimately
related
both
to
the
taxpayer's
illegal
conduct
and
to
the
nondeductible
fine
levied
upon
conviction.
the
expenses
here
in
question
were
after
all
incurred
in
the
very
proceeding
between
respondent
and
the
sovereign
in
which
his
guilt
was
determined
and
in
which
he
was
punished.
and
the
commissioner
takes
the
position
that
the
strong
public
policy
expressed
by
three
federal
statutes
here
in
question
requires
the
disallowance
of
his
fees
in
litigating
just
as
much
as
it
requires
the
disallowance
of
the
$18,000
fine
which
was
levied
against
him
upon
conviction.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
haven't
really
considered
that
aspect
of
it,
especially
in
criminal
cases,
but
--
while
the
commissioner
recognizes
that
if
the
policy
of
the
united
states
certainly
to
provide
counsel
for
those
who
cannot
afford
to
retain
them,
the
commissioner
does
not
believe
that
this
policy
would
be
furthered
by
upholding
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case,
because
the
deduction
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
would
certainly
bear
no
relation
to
the
taxpayer's
ability
to
pay
for
counsel
himself.
in
fact,
in
most
cases
allowing
a
deduction
would
bear
--
the
benefit
of
allowing
a
deduction
would
bear
an
inverse
relationship
to
the
tax
benefit
afforded.
the
higher
the
taxpayer's
income,
of
course,
the
higher
his
tax
bracket;
the
higher
this
tax
bracket,
the
greater
the
benefit
he'll
receive
from
a
deduction.
in
other
words,
if
a
man
incurs
$20,000
worth
of
attorney's
fees
and
he's
in
the
80%
bracket
or
the
70%
bracket,
he
gets
a
$14,000
tax
subsidy
so
to
speak.
if
he's
in
the
10%
or
20%
bracket,
his
tax
subsidy
is
only
20%
of
his
attorney's
fees.
therefore,
we
would
come
out
with
the
result
of
allowing
a
deduction
here
that
the
higher
the
taxpayer's
income,
the
higher
his
tax
bracket,
the
greater
his
benefit
from
the
deduction.
the
man
with
the
large
income
who
least
needs
a
federal
subsidy
to
guarantee
his
constitutional
right
to
counsel
would
get
the
largest
amount
of
tax
benefit,
while
the
man
who
has
little
or
no
income
and
who
most
needs
federal
help
would
get
the
smallest
tax
rate.
therefore,
the
commissioner
believes
that
the
use
of
the
income
tax
laws
is
a
vehicle
for
promoting
adequate
representation
by
counsel
is
a
singularly
inappropriate
choice
and
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
he
believes
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
grant
a
tax
subsidy
to
people
who
have
violated
the
laws
so
that
they
may
retain
counsel
absent
to
showing
of
need
in
order
to
defend
against
that
conviction.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
do
not
know
the
exact
figures
in
this
case.
it
would
be
deductible
from
the
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
it
may
be
profit
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
it
may
be
profit,
i
don't
know
whether
in
the
year
that
he
paid
the
attorney's
fee
he
was
still
earning
any
profits,
he
may
well
have
been
out
of
business
by
then.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i'm
informed
that
that
to
at
least
some
extent
he
was
still
in
the
securities
business,
although
i
should
imagine
his
business
was
probably
greatly
reduced.
if
the
man
had,
and
i
don't
know
the
facts,
accumulated
a
great
deal
of
wealth,
he
would
be
having
dividends,
interest
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no
it
did
not.
this
court
long
ago
held
that
illegal
income
is
nevertheless
taxable
just
as
clearly
as
legal
income.
let
me
just
--
if
i
may
have
just
one
more
moment
to
try
to
quickly
summarize
the
commissioner's
position
and
state
very
briefly
the
solicitor
general's.
well
i'll
rest
on
the
point
set
forth
in
the
brief
such
as
the
cammarano
case
that
clearly
shows
that
expenditures
which
are
related
to
a
constitutional
right
are
not
necessarily
deductible
merely
because
there
is
a
constitutional
right.
respondent
himself
concedes
that
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
defending
a
criminal
prosecution
arising
out
of
personal
acts
are
not
deductible
despite
the
fact
that
there's
a
constitutional
right.
let
me
set
forth
for
just
one
moment
the
solicitor
general's
position
which
i've
mentioned
but
not
given
the
--
his
reasoning.
his
reasoning
is
that
the
constitutional
right
to
retain
counsel
while
it
does
not
necessarily
require
a
deduction
may
well
be
considered
as
one
of
the
policies
mitigating
in
favor
of
a
deduction.
moreover,
the
solicitor
general
finds
it
difficult
to
believe
that
anyone
about
to
engage
in
criminal
activities
would
be
encouraged
to
engage
in
those
activities
merely
because
he
knows
that
his
expenses
of
retaining
counsel
if
he's
caught
and
convicted
will
be
deductible.
and
finally
that
allowing
a
deduction
for
attorney's
fees
arising
out
of
a
business
crime
would
give
them
no
more
or
no
better
treatment
than
other
business-related
expenditures,
and
thus
that
public
policy
ground
invoked
by
the
commissioner
while
it
has
been
consistently
accepted
for
40
years
by
the
courts
during
reenactment
does
not
apply
as
strongly
here
as
it
does
to
the
cases
that
this
court
has
already
upheld
such
as
illegal
bribes
and
criminal
fines
assessed
by
a
court.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
the
solicitor
general
has
not
urged
either
position
by
expressing
his
doubts
about
the
correctness
of
the
commissioner's
position.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
assume
that
the
solicitor
general's
position
by
expressing
doubts
is
that
he
has
serious
doubts
that
this
case
should
be
reversed.
he
has
not
said
he
thinks
it
should
be
affirmed,
in
that
sense,
he's
here
as
a
friend
of
the
court
stating
his
view.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
the
solicitor
general
who
designated
the
man
who
to
argue
this
case
hoped
that
in
this
oral
argument
i
would
be
able
to
set
forth
the
commissioner's
position
with
some
strength
if
i
have
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
perhaps
i'm
wearing
two
hats,
but
i
am
here
advocating
that
this
court
reverse
the
conviction
in
behalf
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
when
i
make
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
when
i
make
the
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
commissioner,
i
am
seriously
urging
this
court
to
reverse
the
conviction.
however,
at
the
same
time,
i
have
the
duty
of
setting
forth
the
solicitor
general's
position.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that
was
the
lilly
case.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
lilly
case.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
l-i-l-l-y.
in
the
lilly
case,
opticians
were
granting
a
33.3%
kickback,
as
i
recall,
to
a
prescribing
doctor
who
sent
a
prescription
there
to
be
filled
for
eyeglasses.
it
was
a
kickback
to
the
prescribing
doctor.
the
commissioner
and
the
solicitor
general
took
the
position
that
these
kickbacks
were
nondeductible
so
far
as
the
payer,
the
company
that
makes
the
glasses
is
concerned,
on
the
ground
that
sharply
defined
public
policy
prevented
such
a
deduction.
this
court
in
that
case
held
that
there
was
no
governmentally
enunciated
public
policy
which
was
violated
by
this
practice,
no
state
statute,
no
federal
statute,
perhaps
it
was
found
upon
by
the
ama,
but
it
was
not
a
sharply
defined
governmentally
enunciated
public
policy.
therefore,
this
court
allowed
the
deduction.
later
in
the
tank
truck
case
where
this
court
found
that
the
activities
violated
state
statutes,
they
are
overweight
truck
statutes,
this
court
invoked
the
public
policy
doctrine
and
confirmed
the
lower
courts
40
years
of
consistent
use
of
that
doctrine
at
least
to
the
extent
of
disallowing
criminal
fines.
here,
the
commissioner
takes
the
position
that
the
three
federal
statutes
here
involved
which
were
all
violated
by
the
respondent
for
which
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
of
violating,
express
a
very
strong
public
policy
which
requires
the
disallowance
of
the
deductions
here
in
question.
