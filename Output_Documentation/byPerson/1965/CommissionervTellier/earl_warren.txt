number
351,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
petitioner
versus
walter
f.
tellier,
et
ux.
mr.
levin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
first
two
types
are
established
here,
does
that
decide
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
to
have
the
third?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
believe
that
he
should
sustain
the
third?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
sort
of
a
case.
is
there
anything
peculiar
about
the
--
about
the
act,
the
securities
act
or
the
businessman
that
was
in
that
would
distinguish
it
from
an
ordinary
business
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
thinking
this,
suppose
a
man
was
in
the
automobile
business,
secondhand
automobile
business,
and
it
was
charged
that
in
connection
with
that
business,
he
had
acted
as
offense
for
stolen
automobile
and
he
was
convicted.
would
it
be
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
that
his
attorney's
fees
and
cost
would
be
deductible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
that
--
that
could
not
be
distinguished
from
this
case,
i
gather?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
think
that
in
that
case
that
i
--
that
i
gave
you
that
there's
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
--
whether
he
could
deduct
his
--
no,
as
a
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
you
could
have
to
pay
his
tax
on
that
money.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
has
been
done
you
say
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
the
commissioner
for
40
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
the
--
when
did
the
solicitor
general
first
start
to
express
such
doubts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
first
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
other
solicitor
general
acquiesced
in
--
in
the
viewpoint
of
the
commissioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
ever
--
have
they
supported
it
in
the
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
--
what
does
the
solicitor
general
urge
that
we
do
with
this
case,
affirm
it
or
reverse
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
he
comes
here
merely
as
a
friend
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
think
the
commissioner
would
be
entitled
to
some
real
representation
then
in
this
case.
we're
not
accustomed
to
have
just
friend
of
the
court
on
one
side
in
the
government's
case
and
counsel
on
the
other.
why
in
the
situation
of
this
kind
wouldn't
the
commissioner
represent
himself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
do
you
have
the
case
that
we
followed
back
then,
follow
the
argument
of
the
commissioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
seriously
or
are
you
just
stating
his
arguments
as
a
friend
of
the
court
and
then
stating
the
arguments
of
the
other
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
urge
him
a
little
stronger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
seems
an
odd
situation
but
you're
here
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kaminsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
denying
a
man
his
constitutional
right
that
he
has
to
pay
a
tax
on
money
that
he
expends
for
his
defense
in
a
criminal
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that's
a
different
argument
from
the
one
you're
making
about
the
sixth
amendment
about
he's
entitled
to
counsel
and
entitled
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
his
deduction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
take
gideon
versus
cochran,
he
was
burglar,
allegedly
a
burglar.
was
he
entitled
to
the
tax
deduction
for
defense
in
his
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
can
be
answered
as
simply
as
yes
or
no.
was
he
entitled
to
--
was
he
entitled
to
a
deduction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
if
gideon
was
a
habitual
burglar
and
made
his
entire
living
by
burglarizing
stores,
if
he
was
alleged
to
have
done
here,
he'd
be
entitled
to
a
deduction.
but
if
he
just
did
it
once,
he
wouldn't
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we're
talking
about
taxes
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
the
man
is
entitled
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
a
deduction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
take
the
case
that
i
asked
to
mr.
levin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
man
in
the
automobile
business,
a
secondhand
automobile
business
covers
up
by
his
business
the
fact
that
his
offense
for
stolen
automobiles
and
he
is
charged
with
knowingly
receiving
and
handling
stolen
goods
and
he's
convicted
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
feel
--
do
you
feel
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
a
tax
deduction
because
he
was
in
the
business
of
selling
secondhand
automobiles
and
therefore
have
the
privilege
of
also
doing
offense
for
stolen
automobiles
to
the
extent
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
deduct
his
expenses
in
maintaining
himself
his
offense?
