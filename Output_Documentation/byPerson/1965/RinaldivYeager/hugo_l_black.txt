justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
question
involved
in
this
particular
man's
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
so
far
as
he
is
concerned,
is
he
hurt
by
that
particular
provision,
that's
what
i
was
asking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
could
you
be?
i
haven't
yet
gathered
how
he
could
be
by
that
provision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
real
issue
here
--
i'm
just
asking
because
i
am
not
sure,
is
this.
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
authorized
people
to
appeal
who
are
indigents
even
though
they
can't
pay
the
court
of
the
cost.
they're
not
barred
from
taking
their
appeal
as
was
the
case
in
griffin.
what
you
have
then
is
that
the
state
has
said
that
we're
going
to
create
a
debt
against
you
for
cost
if
you
lose
just
as
we
created
debt
against
all
losing
indigents.
is
that
right
as
to
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
--
suppose
he
is
not
a
prisoner
and
being
paid
for
the
state.
does
he
have
to
pay
the
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
collect
the
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he's
not
a
pauper
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
loses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pay
costs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
--
why
is
that,
(inaudible)
that
the
state
created
debt
for
those
cost
and
how
do
they
collect
that
debt
from
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
he's
not
a
pauper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
paid
them
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
difference
here
then
is
it,
after
you
finally
get
down
to
the
ultimate
difference
is
that
the
state
pays
those
costs
for
an
indigent.
but
it
says,
we're
going
to
require
you
to
pay
them
back
like
the
other
people
would
have
to
pay
the
cost
if
you
have
--
get
abled
or
if
we
can
collect
it
by
deducting
it
from
something
that
somebody
owes
you,
is
that
the
result
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
say
they
collect
it
from
the
others
without
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
for
non-indigents,
you
say
they
collect
it
from
them
anyhow.
if
they've
got
it,
they
can
collect
it,
they
collect
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
have
a
system
whereby
you
collect
costs.
but
you
waive
that
as
i
understand
it
for
the
defendants
who
are
indigents
but
you
also
say
that
although
we
are
waiving
this,
we
claimed
that
our
state
has
the
power.
no
federal
provision
constitutional
provision
prohibits
us
from
collecting
that
back
if
we
want
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
ultimate
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know.
or
there's
something
else.
i
didn't
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
that
was
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
the
state
might
have
the
power
to
go
after
an
indigent
to
make
him
pay
the
money
back
but
it
might
if
the
reason
of
some
special
provision
which
thereby
discriminated
him
against
him
on
account
of
the
fact
that
they
were
indigent,
still
could
be
barred
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you're
--
then
the
ultimate
issue
as
you
see
it,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that's
the
ultimate
issue
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
one
he
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
to
the
issue,
completely
clear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
case
in
your
judgment
depend
on
a
holding
that
a
state
is
without
constitutional
power
to
collect
back
from
a
defendant
that
it
is
required
to
pay
costs,
that
is
without
constitutional
power
to
collect
that
money
back
if
they
can,
so
long
as
the
law
doesn't
in
some
way
discriminate
as
between
the
person
to
which
collect
it
from.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
argument
but
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
as
my
understanding
of
griffin
would
not
go
--
does
not
fit
in
--
it
is
not
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
wholly
distinguishable
in
this
respect.
there
we
held
as
to
the
non-indigent,
the
right
to
get
his
appeal
heard
because
of
his
indigency
would
deny
him
equal
protection
of
the
law.
this
man
here
had
his
appeal
heard,
so
you
have
to
go
a
little
further
than
the
griffin
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
deprivation
of
property
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
relying
on
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
relying
on
the
griffin
principle
there
unless
we
consider
the
two
as
meaning
the
same
and
they
do
--
maybe
one
of
them
does
substantial
includes
those
but
deprivation
of
property
here
is
in
effect,
they
are
in
taking
his
property
when
others
who
are
in
factually
the
same
situation
as
him
do
not
have
their
property
taken.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
question
involved
in
this
