mr.
alan
b.
handler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
certain
in
my
own
mind
exactly
what
constitutional
grounds
appellant
concentrates
on
in
his
attack
upon
the
new
jersey
statute.
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
proceedings
below
as
to
whether
or
not
an
eighth
amendment
and
the
thirteenth
amendment
ground
were
advanced.
in
the
brief
presented
to
this
court,
it
would
appear
that
appellant
has
argued
that
the
statute
violates
both
due
process
and
equal
protection.
and
then
there
was
a
separate
argument
with
respect
to
discrimination
in
the
application
of
the
statute
to
this
appellant.
whatever
they
purport
of
the
constitutional
attack
is
however,
it
is
extremely
important
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
new
jersey
statute
in
its
totality.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
this
statute
is
designed
to
provide
an
indigent
with
an
effective
and
prompt
right
of
appeal
and
in
some
measure,
to
minimize
the
cost
to
the
public
and
to
discourage
an
abusive
resort
to
the
appellate
judicial
machinery.
the
legislative
history
as
pointed
out
by
counsel
is
barren.
there
is
a
statement
next
to
the
bill
that
was
--
when
it
was
introduced
which
indicates
just
simply
that
the
statute
was
apparently
in
the
past
responsive
to
this
court's
decision
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that's
one
of
our
complaints
also
justice
brennan.
there
are
no
transcripts
or
records
of
legislative
sessions
and
the
only
thing
that
one
can
go
on
might
be
the
statements
annexed
to
the
bill
or
perhaps
any
committee
reports
that
may
have
been
filed.
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
the
advantage
of
any
meaningful
legislative
history
except
it
was
obviously
a
response
by
the
new
jersey
legislature
to
fall
within
the
mandate
of
the
griffin
case
and
the
statement
of
the
bill
so
provides.
well,
let's
--
left
to
infer
however
as
to
what
else
the
new
jersey
state
legislature
had
in
mind
when
it
included
in
its
statutory
provision
section
18.
we
have
suggested,
as
i've
just
mentioned
that
reasoning
from
the
obvious
thrust
of
the
statute,
it
must
have
been
designed
to
discourage
in
some
measure
a
promiscuous
or
wanton
resort
to
the
judicial
machinery
and
although
its
impact
is
not
great,
it
is
designed
in
a
minimal
way
to
defray
the
clause
that
are
otherwise
visited
on
the
public.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
that
anyone
can
be
certain
as
a
matter
of
any
objective
analysis
whether
an
appeal
is
frivolous
or
whether
sham
or
bogus
merely
because
an
appeal
is
lost.
i
suppose
could
--
enable
it
to
fall
into
the
category
of
non-meritorious
but
there
could
be
a
serious
appeal
taken
which
lacks
merit
in
which
may
be
anything
but
frivolous.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that's
--
has
happened
probably
too
often
and
of
course
it's
happened
not
infrequently
in
the
area
of
appeals
by
indigents.
but
counsel
has
argued
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
that
he
has
no
quarrel
with
section
17
of
the
law
which
is
the
application
provision
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
this
concession
on
his
part
is
fairly
mandated
by
the
history
of
the
case.
the
application
provision
of
the
new
jersey
law
has
been
considered
and
comparable
statutory
provisions
have
been
considered
by
this
court
in
at
least
three
of
the
other
so-called
main
decisions,
eskridge,
draper
and
lane
versus
brown.
each
involved
a
state
statutory
provision
which
entailed
an
application
of
some
kind
being
made
by
an
indigent
for
a
free
transcript
and
in
each
of
those
cases
as
applied
to
the
particular
indigent
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
provision
was
unconstitutional
that
it
was
discriminatory.
in
this
case
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no.
i'm
only
referring
to
section
17
of
the
new
jersey
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
--
statute
which
requires
an
indigent
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
is
attacking
section
18
which
is
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
--
reimbursement
statute.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
in
evaluating
the
new
jersey
statute
in
its
totality
and
as
applied
to
this
appellant,
i
think
it
important
that
the
court
appreciate
that
the
new
jersey
statute
has
a
application
provision,
that
as
applied
to
this
particular
appellant
he
was
not
deterred
or
impeded
in
his
recourse
to
the
appellate
courts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
took
two
appeals
from
two
separate
convictions
and
his
applications
were
promptly
passed
favorably
by
the
appellate
division.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
section
18
would
have
been
inoperative.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
in
other
words,
section
17
is
designed
to
enable
any
person
claiming
a
state
of
indigency
to
apply
to
the
court
for
a
free
transcript.
and
incidentally,
i
might
point
out
that
the
new
jersey
rules
of
court
go
beyond
the
statute
in
question.
because
under
the
new
jersey
rules
a
application
or
petition
may
be
made
in
forma
pauperis
to
relieve
an
indigent
of
all
costs,
not
only
transcript
costs.
these
would
be
filing
fees
and
any
other
costs
or
fees
incidental
to
the
processing
of
a
normal
appeal.
it
also
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
it
does.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
we
point
out
in
a
footnote
in
the
new
jersey
statute
that
provides
for
compensation
both
in
terms
of
cash
as
well
as
time
remission
applies
to
all
inmates
of
all
institutions
including
hospitals
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
and
other
types
of
institutions
where
work
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
yes,
that
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
and
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
a
convicted
person
who
was
mentally
insane
or
met
the
requirements
for
committing.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
chief
justice.
i
would
think
that
if
he
were
acquitted
that
the
statute
would
not
apply
at
all.
the
reimbursement
and
this
is
the
law
applies
only
in
the
event
the
appeal
was
unsuccessful.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
it
would
not
apply
to
that
category
of
indigent
defendant.
and
one
might
very
well
ask
why
should
the
state
make
a
distinction
between
a
prisoner
who
is
confined
to
an
institution
and
an
indigent
defendant
who
has
been
convicted
but
has
been
paroled
or
has
served
out
his
sentence
or
has
received
a
suspended
sentence
before
reimbursement
came
into
operation.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
there
is
a
greater
policy
to
be
subserved
in
assuring
that
persons
in
a
state
of
indigency
notwithstanding
their
convictions
who
have
demonstrated
by
their
good
behavior
in
prison
that
they
are
entitled
to
parole
or
that
they
have
demonstrated
by
virtue
of
their
reports
to
the
sentencing
judge
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
suspended
sentence,
that
the
interest
of
society
in
here
in
effect
that
we
want
people
such
as
these
to
return
to
a
useful
meaningful
place
in
society
and
that
it
does
not
--
that
is
not
conducive
to
any
overriding
state
policy
to
follow
them
for
the
cost
of
their
transcript
appeal.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
would
say
not
entirely
so
mr.
chief
justice.
before
a
person
takes
an
appeal,
i
think
he
has
to
go
to
the
same
risk
weighing
process
as
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
risk
weighing
process.
he
has
to
evaluate
what
the
outcome
of
his
appeal
would
be.
it
may
very
well
be
that
a
person
under
prison
sentence
put
out
on
bail
faces
the
prospect
that
his
appeal
is
unsuccessful
that
he
would
go
to
jail.
he
may
not
know
whether
he'll
get
paroled,
whether
there
will
be
a
remission
of
his
sentence.
and
so
as
long
as
he
faces
the
prospect
that
in
the
event
that
his
appeal
is
unsuccessful
and
that
he
may
go
to
jail,
he
goes
to
the
same
risk
evaluation
that
a
person
not
on
bail
and
confined
to
prison
would
also
have
to
undertake
with
respect
to
a
person
who
has
received
a
suspended
sentence.
it's
true
that
more
likelihood
he
doesn't
anticipate
that
even
if
his
appeal
is
unsuccessful
that
that
sentence
would
be
altered
and
he'd
be
committed
to
jail.
and
to
that
extent
he
is
not
under
the
same
kind
of
onus
but
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don't
think
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
instance
in
which
the
statute
has
been
or
has
not
been
applied
with
respect
to
a
defendant
who
was
under
a
suspended
sentence
who
lost
his
appeal
and
then
there
was
--
remitted
to
prison.
i
don't
know
that
there
has
been
any
occasion.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
would
have
to
concede
that
the
--
that
language
seems
clear
enough
on
that
point.
i
would
only
again
add
that
i'm
not
aware
of
any
occasion
in
which
a
--
the
question
would
arose
as
to
whether
it
could
be
applied
to
somebody
subsequently
going
to
jail.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
it
is
involved
only
to
the
extent
that
the
appellant
is
urging
that
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
classifications
that
it
draws
or
that
it
--
are
inherent
in
the
policy
are
invidious
against
him.
i
don't
think
that
the
appellant
has
urged
that
there
is
a
discrimination
between
a
jail
defendant
and
a
indigent
defendant
who
is
under
a
suspended
sentence
or
was
in
jail
at
the
time
of
his
application.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
think
that
was
in
response
to
a
question.
i'm
sure
counsel
on
his
rebuttal
will
clarify
to
the
court
whether
this
particular
point
is
urged.
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
it
is.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
that
he
is
hurt
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
see
how
he
could
be.
and
i
would
like
to
develop
this
further
thought
as
to
whether
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
substantially
correct
except
for
the
qualification
that
must
be
conceded
that
this
creation
of
a
debt
applies
only
to
a
prisoner
who
is
being
paid
by
the
state.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no.
not
by
any
statutory
authority
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
the
costs
are
waived.
in
other
words,
if
a
defendant
takes
an
appeal
and
he
has
satisfied
the
court
that
he
is
a
pauper
and
the
court
authorizes
him
to
proceed
with
his
appeal,
free
of
cost
and
his
appeal
is
unsuccessful,
certainly,
if
he
doesn't
go
to
jail,
there
would
be
no
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
if
he's
not
a
pauper,
he
would
pay.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
would
pay
costs.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
would
pay
costs.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
those
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
those
costs
would
be
assessed
in
the
normal
course
of
litigation.
in
other
words,
it
would
--
he
would
have
to
pose
post
cost
to
file
his
notice
of
appeal.
he
would
have
to
file
--
pay
certain
filing
and
docket
costs.
if
he
wanted
a
transcript
and
the
transcript
would
be
necessary
if
he's
urging
trial
hours,
he
would
have
to
order
it
himself
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
--
from
the
reporter
and
pay
it
for
himself.
and
if
he
didn't,
his
appeal
couldn't
proceed.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
the
state
does
that
only
with
respect
to
indigents.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
thought
your
question
applied
to
non-indigents,
mr.
justice
black.
in
other
words
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
is
the
ultimate
issue
of
what
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
justice
black's
question
however
was
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
the
case
here.
your
question
was
whether
the
state
has
the
power
to
go
after
indigents
in
general
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
oh!
i
certainly
have
to
agree
with
that.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
of
course
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
agree
with
his
statement
of
the
problem.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
getting
back
of
course
to
your
earlier
question
you
indicated
that
isn't
the
state
being
somewhat
ambivalent
or
inconsistent
in
only
searching
for
costs,
transcript
costs
against
the
indigent
prisoner
not
going
near
to
the
indigent
who
is
not
in
jail
if
the
state's
policy
is
to
discourage
frivolous
appeals.
and
i
would
suggest
by
way
of
the
answer
that
even
though
this
inferentially
is
probably
one
of
the
policies
of
the
statute
that
there
are
other
considerations
that
cut
across
other
objectives
of
state
policy
which
are
also
entitled
some
deference.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
now,
the
question
that
would
have
to
be
posed
by
the
court,
is
there
any
reasonable
basis
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
not
to
collect
the
costs
of
litigation
against
indigents
who
are
not
confined
to
prison,
notwithstanding
they
are
under
conviction
that
they
have
not
reverse
their
convictions.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
larger
policy
involved
is
that
these
people
by
virtue
of
their
backgrounds
either
that
they
have
--
been
entitled
to
parole
or
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
suspended
sentence
based
upon
a
sentencing
judge
evaluation
of
their
personalities,
that
these
people
should
be
permitted
to
function
in
society
as
best
they
can
without
the
added
burden
of
the
state
assessing
cost
of
litigation
against
them.
i
think
you
have
a
different
consideration.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
that
question
cannot
be
answered
unless
you
give
some
consideration
to
why
in
one
case
a
man
is
sentenced
and
in
another
case,
he
is
given
probation.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
this
is
not
disassociated
from
the
policy
of
the
statute.
there
are
several
strains
that
that
runs
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
there
can
be
that
practical
aspect
of
what
is
a
practical
consideration
by
entering
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
(inaudible)
mr.
alan
b.
handler
there's
no
question,
they
have
to
do
an
awful
lot
of
bookkeeping
to
it.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
(voice
overlap)
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
but
i
do
want
to
get
back
to
the
distinction
between
the
state's
treatment
of
a
person
not
confined
to
prison
and
an
indigent
who
is.
and
i
think
that
the
greater
policy
that's
being
subserved
by
the
state
not
taxing
the
cost
of
an
indigent
not
in
jail
is
that
with
this
type
of
person,
he
represents
a
good
risk
for
the
state,
for
society.
he
doesn't
deserve
a
jail
sentence
and
for
that
reason,
he
hasn't
been
confined
to
jail.
since
he's
indigent,
undoubtedly,
society
wants
to
give
him
every
opportunity
to
be
self-sustaining,
to
become
responsible
and
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
with
that
greater
policy
to
assess
him
for
the
cost
of
an
appeal
notwithstanding
that
it
was
an
unsuccessful
appeal.
now
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
i
--
i
say
yes
with
this
broader
answer.
the
monetary
wage
is
only
part
of
the
compensation
that
a
prisoner
gets
and
it
is
in
fact
the
less
important
compensation
that
he
receives.
a
prisoner
under
the
new
jersey
regulations
at
the
present
time
can
earn
as
much
as
55
cents
a
day
depending
upon
how
hard
he
is
willing
to
work
and
what
he
wants
to
do.
the
most
important
thing
as
far
as
a
prisoner
is
concerned
is
the
remission
of
time
off
his
sentence.
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
to
pay
it
off
that
much
more
quickly.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
it
is
except
by
--
again,
i
don't
know
that
the
question
has
ever
imposed
as
to
whether
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
they
have
to
take
it
all
at
the
same
time.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
i
do
want
to
put
before
the
court
the
added
thought
that
under
the
new
jersey
compensation
provision
that
the
other
element
of
compensation
is
remission
from
the
sentence
and
that
under
the
statute
as
well
as
under
the
regulations
governing
state
institutions
prisoners
that
show
by
their
conduct
that
they
can
become
minimum
security
risks
can
get
a
much
more
accelerated
credit
on
their
sentence
than
prisoners
that
have
not
(inaudible)
that.
with
respect
to
the
argument
of
the
appellant
that
there
has
been
discrimination
in
connection
with
other
types
of
criminal
defendants,
i
would
of
course
urge
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
meaningful
or
invidious
discrimination
as
far
as
prisoners
convicted
of
capital
offenses
may
be
concerned.
but
with
respect
to
successful
indigents
the
non-assessment
of
costs
i
think
is
reflected
of
the
general
state
policy
that
costs
are
normal
incident
to
litigation
with
respect
to
a
losing
litigant.
with
respect
to
the
unsuccessful,
non-indigent,
of
course
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
he's
paid
his
costs
and
not
only
his
transcript
costs
but
of
course
all
of
the
costs
of
litigation
which
include
his
attorney's
fees,
printing
costs,
costs
of
investigation
and
any
other
fees
that
may
be
involved.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
there
has
been
invidious
discrimination
in
the
application
of
the
statute,
i
think
that
the
court
must
appreciate
that
the
mechanics
for
the
reimbursement
of
the
statute
arise
upon
a
request
by
county
officials
that
reimbursement
be
had
against
a
particular
inmate.
criminal
prosecution
of
course
is
handled
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
by
their
respective
counties
and
so
there
maybe
some
unevenness
in
terms
of
the
overall
application
of
the
statute
but
certainly
there
is
no
basis
in
this
record
for
the
assertion
that
this
is
discrimination,
is
invidious
or
purposefully
selected.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
thank
you
sir.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
certain
in
my
own
mind
exactly
what
constitutional
grounds
appellant
concentrates
on
in
his
attack
upon
the
new
jersey
statute.
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
proceedings
below
as
to
whether
or
not
an
eighth
amendment
and
the
thirteenth
amendment
ground
were
advanced.
in
the
brief
presented
to
this
court,
it
would
appear
that
appellant
has
argued
that
the
statute
violates
both
due
process
and
equal
protection.
and
then
there
was
a
separate
argument
with
respect
to
discrimination
in
the
application
of
the
statute
to
this
appellant.
whatever
they
purport
of
the
constitutional
attack
is
however,
it
is
extremely
important
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
new
jersey
statute
in
its
totality.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
this
statute
is
designed
to
provide
an
indigent
with
an
effective
and
prompt
right
of
appeal
and
in
some
measure,
to
minimize
the
cost
to
the
public
and
to
discourage
an
abusive
resort
to
the
appellate
judicial
machinery.
the
legislative
history
as
pointed
out
by
counsel
is
barren.
there
is
a
statement
next
to
the
bill
that
was
--
when
it
was
introduced
which
indicates
just
simply
that
the
statute
was
apparently
in
the
past
responsive
to
this
court's
decision
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that's
one
of
our
complaints
also
justice
brennan.
there
are
no
transcripts
or
records
of
legislative
sessions
and
the
only
thing
that
one
can
go
on
might
be
the
statements
annexed
to
the
bill
or
perhaps
any
committee
reports
that
may
have
been
filed.
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
the
advantage
of
any
meaningful
legislative
history
except
it
was
obviously
a
response
by
the
new
jersey
legislature
to
fall
within
the
mandate
of
the
griffin
case
and
the
statement
of
the
bill
so
provides.
well,
let's
--
left
to
infer
however
as
to
what
else
the
new
jersey
state
legislature
had
in
mind
when
it
included
in
its
statutory
provision
section
18.
we
have
suggested,
as
i've
just
mentioned
that
reasoning
from
the
obvious
thrust
of
the
statute,
it
must
have
been
designed
to
discourage
in
some
measure
a
promiscuous
or
wanton
resort
to
the
judicial
machinery
and
although
its
impact
is
not
great,
it
is
designed
in
a
minimal
way
to
defray
the
clause
that
are
otherwise
visited
on
the
public.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
that
anyone
can
be
certain
as
a
matter
of
any
objective
analysis
whether
an
appeal
is
frivolous
or
whether
sham
or
bogus
merely
because
an
appeal
is
lost.
i
suppose
could
--
enable
it
to
fall
into
the
category
of
non-meritorious
but
there
could
be
a
serious
appeal
taken
which
lacks
merit
in
which
may
be
anything
but
frivolous.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that's
--
has
happened
probably
too
often
and
of
course
it's
happened
not
infrequently
in
the
area
of
appeals
by
indigents.
but
counsel
has
argued
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
that
he
has
no
quarrel
with
section
17
of
the
law
which
is
the
application
provision
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
this
concession
on
his
part
is
fairly
mandated
by
the
history
of
the
case.
the
application
provision
of
the
new
jersey
law
has
been
considered
and
comparable
statutory
provisions
have
been
considered
by
this
court
in
at
least
three
of
the
other
so-called
main
decisions,
eskridge,
draper
and
lane
versus
brown.
each
involved
a
state
statutory
provision
which
entailed
an
application
of
some
kind
being
made
by
an
indigent
for
a
free
transcript
and
in
each
of
those
cases
as
applied
to
the
particular
indigent
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
provision
was
unconstitutional
that
it
was
discriminatory.
in
this
case
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no.
i'm
only
referring
to
section
17
of
the
new
jersey
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
--
statute
which
requires
an
indigent
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
is
attacking
section
18
which
is
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
--
reimbursement
statute.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
in
evaluating
the
new
jersey
statute
in
its
totality
and
as
applied
to
this
appellant,
i
think
it
important
that
the
court
appreciate
that
the
new
jersey
statute
has
a
application
provision,
that
as
applied
to
this
particular
appellant
he
was
not
deterred
or
impeded
in
his
recourse
to
the
appellate
courts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
took
two
appeals
from
two
separate
convictions
and
his
applications
were
promptly
passed
favorably
by
the
appellate
division.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
section
18
would
have
been
inoperative.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
in
other
words,
section
17
is
designed
to
enable
any
person
claiming
a
state
of
indigency
to
apply
to
the
court
for
a
free
transcript.
and
incidentally,
i
might
point
out
that
the
new
jersey
rules
of
court
go
beyond
the
statute
in
question.
because
under
the
new
jersey
rules
a
application
or
petition
may
be
made
in
forma
pauperis
to
relieve
an
indigent
of
all
costs,
not
only
transcript
costs.
these
would
be
filing
fees
and
any
other
costs
or
fees
incidental
to
the
processing
of
a
normal
appeal.
it
also
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
it
does.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
we
point
out
in
a
footnote
in
the
new
jersey
statute
that
provides
for
compensation
both
in
terms
of
cash
as
well
as
time
remission
applies
to
all
inmates
of
all
institutions
including
hospitals
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
and
other
types
of
institutions
where
work
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
yes,
that
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
and
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
a
convicted
person
who
was
mentally
insane
or
met
the
requirements
for
committing.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
chief
justice.
i
would
think
that
if
he
were
acquitted
that
the
statute
would
not
apply
at
all.
the
reimbursement
and
this
is
the
law
applies
only
in
the
event
the
appeal
was
unsuccessful.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
it
would
not
apply
to
that
category
of
indigent
defendant.
and
one
might
very
well
ask
why
should
the
state
make
a
distinction
between
a
prisoner
who
is
confined
to
an
institution
and
an
indigent
defendant
who
has
been
convicted
but
has
been
paroled
or
has
served
out
his
sentence
or
has
received
a
suspended
sentence
before
reimbursement
came
into
operation.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
there
is
a
greater
policy
to
be
subserved
in
assuring
that
persons
in
a
state
of
indigency
notwithstanding
their
convictions
who
have
demonstrated
by
their
good
behavior
in
prison
that
they
are
entitled
to
parole
or
that
they
have
demonstrated
by
virtue
of
their
reports
to
the
sentencing
judge
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
suspended
sentence,
that
the
interest
of
society
in
here
in
effect
that
we
want
people
such
as
these
to
return
to
a
useful
meaningful
place
in
society
and
that
it
does
not
--
that
is
not
conducive
to
any
overriding
state
policy
to
follow
them
for
the
cost
of
their
transcript
appeal.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
would
say
not
entirely
so
mr.
chief
justice.
before
a
person
takes
an
appeal,
i
think
he
has
to
go
to
the
same
risk
weighing
process
as
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
risk
weighing
process.
he
has
to
evaluate
what
the
outcome
of
his
appeal
would
be.
it
may
very
well
be
that
a
person
under
prison
sentence
put
out
on
bail
faces
the
prospect
that
his
appeal
is
unsuccessful
that
he
would
go
to
jail.
he
may
not
know
whether
he'll
get
paroled,
whether
there
will
be
a
remission
of
his
sentence.
and
so
as
long
as
he
faces
the
prospect
that
in
the
event
that
his
appeal
is
unsuccessful
and
that
he
may
go
to
jail,
he
goes
to
the
same
risk
evaluation
that
a
person
not
on
bail
and
confined
to
prison
would
also
have
to
undertake
with
respect
to
a
person
who
has
received
a
suspended
sentence.
it's
true
that
more
likelihood
he
doesn't
anticipate
that
even
if
his
appeal
is
unsuccessful
that
that
sentence
would
be
altered
and
he'd
be
committed
to
jail.
and
to
that
extent
he
is
not
under
the
same
kind
of
onus
but
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don't
think
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
instance
in
which
the
statute
has
been
or
has
not
been
applied
with
respect
to
a
defendant
who
was
under
a
suspended
sentence
who
lost
his
appeal
and
then
there
was
--
remitted
to
prison.
i
don't
know
that
there
has
been
any
occasion.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
would
have
to
concede
that
the
--
that
language
seems
clear
enough
on
that
point.
i
would
only
again
add
that
i'm
not
aware
of
any
occasion
in
which
a
--
the
question
would
arose
as
to
whether
it
could
be
applied
to
somebody
subsequently
going
to
jail.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
it
is
involved
only
to
the
extent
that
the
appellant
is
urging
that
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
classifications
that
it
draws
or
that
it
--
are
inherent
in
the
policy
are
invidious
against
him.
i
don't
think
that
the
appellant
has
urged
that
there
is
a
discrimination
between
a
jail
defendant
and
a
indigent
defendant
who
is
under
a
suspended
sentence
or
was
in
jail
at
the
time
of
his
application.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
think
that
was
in
response
to
a
question.
i'm
sure
counsel
on
his
rebuttal
will
clarify
to
the
court
whether
this
particular
point
is
urged.
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
it
is.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
that
he
is
hurt
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
see
how
he
could
be.
and
i
would
like
to
develop
this
further
thought
as
to
whether
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
substantially
correct
except
for
the
qualification
that
must
be
conceded
that
this
creation
of
a
debt
applies
only
to
a
prisoner
who
is
being
paid
by
the
state.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no.
not
by
any
statutory
authority
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
the
costs
are
waived.
in
other
words,
if
a
defendant
takes
an
appeal
and
he
has
satisfied
the
court
that
he
is
a
pauper
and
the
court
authorizes
him
to
proceed
with
his
appeal,
free
of
cost
and
his
appeal
is
unsuccessful,
certainly,
if
he
doesn't
go
to
jail,
there
would
be
no
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
if
he's
not
a
pauper,
he
would
pay.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
would
pay
costs.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
would
pay
costs.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
those
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
those
costs
would
be
assessed
in
the
normal
course
of
litigation.
in
other
words,
it
would
--
he
would
have
to
pose
post
cost
to
file
his
notice
of
appeal.
he
would
have
to
file
--
pay
certain
filing
and
docket
costs.
if
he
wanted
a
transcript
and
the
transcript
would
be
necessary
if
he's
urging
trial
hours,
he
would
have
to
order
it
himself
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
--
from
the
reporter
and
pay
it
for
himself.
and
if
he
didn't,
his
appeal
couldn't
proceed.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
the
state
does
that
only
with
respect
to
indigents.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
thought
your
question
applied
to
non-indigents,
mr.
justice
black.
in
other
words
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
is
the
ultimate
issue
of
what
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
justice
black's
question
however
was
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
the
case
here.
your
question
was
whether
the
state
has
the
power
to
go
after
indigents
in
general
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
oh!
i
certainly
have
to
agree
with
that.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
of
course
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
agree
with
his
statement
of
the
problem.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
getting
back
of
course
to
your
earlier
question
you
indicated
that
isn't
the
state
being
somewhat
ambivalent
or
inconsistent
in
only
searching
for
costs,
transcript
costs
against
the
indigent
prisoner
not
going
near
to
the
indigent
who
is
not
in
jail
if
the
state's
policy
is
to
discourage
frivolous
appeals.
and
i
would
suggest
by
way
of
the
answer
that
even
though
this
inferentially
is
probably
one
of
the
policies
of
the
statute
that
there
are
other
considerations
that
cut
across
other
objectives
of
state
policy
which
are
also
entitled
some
deference.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
now,
the
question
that
would
have
to
be
posed
by
the
court,
is
there
any
reasonable
basis
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
not
to
collect
the
costs
of
litigation
against
indigents
who
are
not
confined
to
prison,
notwithstanding
they
are
under
conviction
that
they
have
not
reverse
their
convictions.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
larger
policy
involved
is
that
these
people
by
virtue
of
their
backgrounds
either
that
they
have
--
been
entitled
to
parole
or
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
suspended
sentence
based
upon
a
sentencing
judge
evaluation
of
their
personalities,
that
these
people
should
be
permitted
to
function
in
society
as
best
they
can
without
the
added
burden
of
the
state
assessing
cost
of
litigation
against
them.
i
think
you
have
a
different
consideration.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
that
question
cannot
be
answered
unless
you
give
some
consideration
to
why
in
one
case
a
man
is
sentenced
and
in
another
case,
he
is
given
probation.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
this
is
not
disassociated
from
the
policy
of
the
statute.
there
are
several
strains
that
that
runs
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
there
can
be
that
practical
aspect
of
what
is
a
practical
consideration
by
entering
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
(inaudible)
mr.
alan
b.
handler
there's
no
question,
they
have
to
do
an
awful
lot
of
bookkeeping
to
it.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
(voice
overlap)
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
but
i
do
want
to
get
back
to
the
distinction
between
the
state's
treatment
of
a
person
not
confined
to
prison
and
an
indigent
who
is.
and
i
think
that
the
greater
policy
that's
being
subserved
by
the
state
not
taxing
the
cost
of
an
indigent
not
in
jail
is
that
with
this
type
of
person,
he
represents
a
good
risk
for
the
state,
for
society.
he
doesn't
deserve
a
jail
sentence
and
for
that
reason,
he
hasn't
been
confined
to
jail.
since
he's
indigent,
undoubtedly,
society
wants
to
give
him
every
opportunity
to
be
self-sustaining,
to
become
responsible
and
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
with
that
greater
policy
to
assess
him
for
the
cost
of
an
appeal
notwithstanding
that
it
was
an
unsuccessful
appeal.
now
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
i
--
i
say
yes
with
this
broader
answer.
the
monetary
wage
is
only
part
of
the
compensation
that
a
prisoner
gets
and
it
is
in
fact
the
less
important
compensation
that
he
receives.
a
prisoner
under
the
new
jersey
regulations
at
the
present
time
can
earn
as
much
as
55
cents
a
day
depending
upon
how
hard
he
is
willing
to
work
and
what
he
wants
to
do.
the
most
important
thing
as
far
as
a
prisoner
is
concerned
is
the
remission
of
time
off
his
sentence.
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
to
pay
it
off
that
much
more
quickly.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
it
is
except
by
--
again,
i
don't
know
that
the
question
has
ever
imposed
as
to
whether
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
they
have
to
take
it
all
at
the
same
time.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
i
do
want
to
put
before
the
court
the
added
thought
that
under
the
new
jersey
compensation
provision
that
the
other
element
of
compensation
is
remission
from
the
sentence
and
that
under
the
statute
as
well
as
under
the
regulations
governing
state
institutions
prisoners
that
show
by
their
conduct
that
they
can
become
minimum
security
risks
can
get
a
much
more
accelerated
credit
on
their
sentence
than
prisoners
that
have
not
(inaudible)
that.
with
respect
to
the
argument
of
the
appellant
that
there
has
been
discrimination
in
connection
with
other
types
of
criminal
defendants,
i
would
of
course
urge
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
meaningful
or
invidious
discrimination
as
far
as
prisoners
convicted
of
capital
offenses
may
be
concerned.
but
with
respect
to
successful
indigents
the
non-assessment
of
costs
i
think
is
reflected
of
the
general
state
policy
that
costs
are
normal
incident
to
litigation
with
respect
to
a
losing
litigant.
with
respect
to
the
unsuccessful,
non-indigent,
of
course
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
he's
paid
his
costs
and
not
only
his
transcript
costs
but
of
course
all
of
the
costs
of
litigation
which
include
his
attorney's
fees,
printing
costs,
costs
of
investigation
and
any
other
fees
that
may
be
involved.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
there
has
been
invidious
discrimination
in
the
application
of
the
statute,
i
think
that
the
court
must
appreciate
that
the
mechanics
for
the
reimbursement
of
the
statute
arise
upon
a
request
by
county
officials
that
reimbursement
be
had
against
a
particular
inmate.
criminal
prosecution
of
course
is
handled
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
by
their
respective
counties
and
so
there
maybe
some
unevenness
in
terms
of
the
overall
application
of
the
statute
but
certainly
there
is
no
basis
in
this
record
for
the
assertion
that
this
is
discrimination,
is
invidious
or
purposefully
selected.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
thank
you
sir.
