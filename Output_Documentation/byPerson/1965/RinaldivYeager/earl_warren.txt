joseph
a.
rinaldi,
appellant,
versus
howard
yeager,
warden,
et
al.
mr.
lacey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
say
the
state
concedes
that
that
was
the
reason
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
of
the
reasons,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
state
that
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
handler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
mr.
handler.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
counsel
had
conceded
that
there
was
no
unconstitutional
application
of
this
statute
to
him?
i
thought
he
said
otherwise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
is
18
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
committed
to
a
mental
hospital,
would
he
have
to
pay
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
wouldn't
apply
to
anybody
who
had
been
placed
on
probation
or
who
had
been
fined
or
had
been
given
a
suspended
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
doesn't
square
very
well
with
your
original
pieces
as
i
understood
that
this
was
to
--
designed
to
discourage
frivolous
appeals.
now,
if
a
man
took
an
appeal
when
he
was
placed
on
probation
or
when
he
was
fined
or
when
he
was
given
a
suspended
sentence
and
he
lost,
you
couldn't
collect
anything
from
him
under
this
section
so
you're
not
basing
it
on
the
question
of
discouraging
frivolous
appeals,
you
are
discouraging
it
upon
the
basis
of
only
the
people
that
the
judges
think
should
go
to
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
in
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
mentioned
something
of
that
in
his
argument
to
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
doesn't
that
raise
some
equal
protection
problem?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
give
you
just
a
specific
case
and
see
if
there
is
any
discrimination,
this
situation.
two
men
are
charged
with
the
commission
of
the
same
offense.
they
are
both
convicted.
one
of
them
is
sent
to
prison.
the
other
one
is
given
probation.
they
both
appealed.
they
both
lose.
they're
both
indigents.
they
both
were
given
a
transcript.
the
man
who
was
convicted
and
placed
on
probation,
goes
out
and
gets
a
job
and
makes
$100
a
week.
the
one
who
goes
to
jail
gets
20
cents
a
day
or
less
than
a
dollar
a
week.
the
state
in
order
to
reimburse
itself
under
section
18
puts
a
lien
on
and
takes
the
20
cents
a
day
that
the
man
in
prison
makes
but
has
no
way
of
collecting
on
the
fellow
who
earns
a
$100
week
and
doesn't
try,
the
state
doesn't
try
to
get
that
back.
how
--
don't
you
think
that's
some
discrimination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you're
putting
it
then
not
on
the
basis
of
frivolous
appeal.
you're
putting
it
on
the
basis
of
who
the
state
thinks
are
good
people
and
who
the
state
thinks
are
bad
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
it
worth
the
candle
for
the
state
to
collect
20
cents
a
day,
the
only
money
that
a
man
can
earn
while
he's
in
prison
and
then
let
go,
free
from
any
obligation
at
all,
the
man
who
goes
out
makes
$100
to
$200
a
week
or
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
it
costs
them
more
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
collect
that
money
than
it's
worth,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
20
cents
a
day
be
given
to
a
man
for
his
work
in
prison
on
the
theory
that
it
would
have
a
tendency
to
rehabilitate
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
want
to
take
that
away
from
him
and
not
take
it
away
from
the
fellow
who's
on
the
outside
and
have
--
make
money
in
an
unlimited
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lacey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lacey,
before
you
sit
down,
i
should
like
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
having
represented
this
indigent
defendant.
i
understand
you
are
appointed
by
the
court
below
and
you've
carried
it
through
with
great
diligence.
and
we
consider
that
to
be
a
real
public
service
and
we
feel
endeavored
to
the
members
of
the
bar
when
they
do
that
and
we
appreciate
your
efforts
in
this
regard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
indeed.

the
rights
of
your
