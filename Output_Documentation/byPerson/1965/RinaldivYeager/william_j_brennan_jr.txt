justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
–
did
it
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
its
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
limited
within
its
application,
the
appeal
held
in
fact
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
or
not
an
--
the
appeal
is
lawful?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
(inaudible)
the
truth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
didn't
the
(inaudible)
supreme
court
used
to
hold
that
there
is
a
public
governmental
obligation
with
a
county
or
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought,
mr.
handler,
that's
all
we
ever
do
get
in
the
way
of
a
legislative
history
in
new
jersey,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
handler,
may
i
ask
you,
suppose
the
--
on
his
conviction,
if
that
--
the
jail
term,
he
got
a
suspended
sentence
and
had
taken
the
appeal.
under
17,
would
he
have
been
entitled
to
a
transcript
as
an
indigent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
section
18
have
been
operative
in
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
inoperative
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
incidentally,
this
applies
only
to
the
one
who
is
in
that
institution,
an
institution
covers
more
than
the
prison,
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mental
hospitals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
still
though,
the
sex
offender
law
that
the
--
on
conviction
for
sex
offense
instead
of
going
to
a
prison,
after
he'd
gone
a
mental
(inaudible)
he
go
to
some
mental
hospital,
do
you
still
have
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
i
take
it
a
--
one
convicted
under
that
statute
and
went
to
a
mental
hospital
and
earn
20
cents
a
day
or
whatever
he
did
at
the
mental
hospital
would
also
be
taken
out
of
his
earnings,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
handler,
how
--
i
can't
read
section
18
as
suggesting
for
example
that
one
who
has
a
suspended
sentence
who
takes
an
appeal
for
some
reason
or
another
the
suspension
is
revoked
and
he
then
goes
to
prison
subject
to
this
section
18,
this
seems
to
indicate
its
only
the
applicant
who
is
confined
at
the
time
he
applies
for
the
transcript
to
whom
this
sentence
--
section
18
applies.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
looking
at
the
words,
the
wording
of
the
statute
itself.
and
the
language
is
confined
so
far
a
notice
to
the
institution
in
which
the
person
upon
to
his
application,
the
transcript
to
the
record
was
prepared
is
confined
which
indicates,
doesn't
it,
that
it
applies
only
to
the
application
that
one
can
find
at
the
time
the
application
is
filed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
handler,
wait
a
minute,
i
don't
know
that
it
is.
as
i
understand
it,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
if
no
costs
whatever
are
assessed
against
the
indigent
who's
not
in
prison
and
whatever
the
cost
may
be
for
a
transcript
and
otherwise
even
if
he
loses,
the
state
thereafter
--
there's
no
provision
in
our
law
which
permits
the
state
thereafter
to
collect
it
from
the
indigent
if
later
on
he
gets
money.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
indigent
who
has
to
pay
anything
is
the
(inaudible)
in
prison
and
then
only
to
the
extent
of
the
20
cents
a
day
that
the
state
pays
him
for
whatever
work
he
does
in
prison.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
earns
55
cents,
under
this
they
take
the
55
cents,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
that's
what
they
take.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
ends
up
with
nothing.
he
decided
to
work
to
get
55
cents,
it's
pretty
well
discouraged,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
says
--
this
says
that,
shall
be
reimbursed
from
any
institutional
earnings
of
the
person.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
to
take
it
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
–
did
it
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
its
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
limited
within
its
application,
the
appeal
held
in

to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.

whether

the

is
lawful?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
(inaudible)
the
truth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
didn't
the
(inaudible)
supreme
court
used
to
hold
that
there
is
a
public
governmental
obligation
with
a
county
or
state?
justice
william

(inaudible)

i

mr.

that's

would
he

justice
william

but
would
section

have
been

inoperative

william

mental
hospitals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
still
though,
the
sex
offender
law
that
the
--
on
conviction
for
sex
offense
instead
of
going
to
a
prison,
after
he'd
gone
a
mental
(inaudible)
he
go
to
some
mental
hospital,
do
you
still
have
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
i
take
it
a
--
one
convicted
under
that
statute
and
went
to
a
mental
hospital
and
earn
20
cents
a
day
or
whatever
he

would
also
