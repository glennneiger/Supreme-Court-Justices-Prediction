mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
joseph
rinaldi,
the
appellant
in
this
proceeding
is
presently
confined
in
the
new
jersey
state
prison.
he
is
there
following
conviction
and
following
admittedly
and
frankly
an
exhaustion
of
not
only
the
trial
process
but
the
appellate
process
afforded
him
by
the
state
of
new
jersey.
to
that
extent,
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear
at
the
outset,
we
are
not
within
the
precise
holding
of
griffin
and
the
cases
which
follow.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
here
contending
that
because
of
this
financial
obligation
which
i
will
point
out
later,
he
was
asked
to
assume,
he
was
impeded
in
having
either
due
process
with
respect
to
his
freedom
at
the
trial
level
or
due
process
with
respect
to
his
freedom
at
the
appellate
level.
the
position
that
i
take
here,
however,
is
i
believe
a
logical
extension
of
what
this
court
has
held
in
griffin
and
the
other
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
such
as
eskridge,
draper,
burns,
etcetera.
specifically,
rinaldi
following
conviction
at
trial
applied
under
new
jersey
procedures
to
be
permitted
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
to
appeal
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
court.
this
procedure
was
pursued
by
him
and
he
was
permitted
to
so
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.2
(a)
152
section
17
permitted
this
procedure
and
he
availed
himself
of
it.
our
quarrel
is
not
with
17
however
but
with
the
next
section
which
is
section
18.
18
we
say,
provided
a
means
whereby
new
jersey
was
permitted
to
utilize
this
carrot
so
to
speak
of
appellate
procedure
to
coerce
rinaldi
into
making
an
assignment
of
all
of
his
institutional
wages
should
he,
following
this
gamble
of
whether
to
appeal
or
not,
take
the
appeal
and
lose
because
section
18
provides
that
if
the
applicant
for
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
should
have
his
conviction
affirmed
on
appeal,
then
the
cost
of
the
trial
transcript
must
be
taken
from
all
of
his
institutional
wages
until
it
is
paid.
we
say
that
this
constituted
unlike
griffin
which
was
of
course
a
due
process
taking
of
liberty,
but
this
constituted
without
due
process,
a
taking
of
property.
i
think
that
in
the
overall
in
terms
of
the
public
interest
and
quite
aside
from
a
narrow
question
of
joseph
rinaldi,
it
flies
in
the
face
of
what
i
believe
was
a
clearly
articulated
philosophy
of
this
court
that
we
don't
want
to
do
anything
that
will
interfere
with
the
thinking
process
as
to
whether
or
not
an
appeal
should
be
taken.
the
history
of
the
statute,
that
is
the
legislative
history,
is
devoid
of
any
assistance
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
it
was.
however,
the
statute
itself
was
a
specific
answer
to
this
court's
holding
in
the
griffin
case.
the
attorney
general
forthrightly
concedes
that
one
of
the
policy
reasons
behind
the
statute
was
to
discourage
frivolous
appeals.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
1958
sir.
griffin,
i
believe,
was
1956,
yes
sir.
and
the
attorney
general
thus
concede
that
one
of
the
policy
reasons
for
it
mr.
justice
brennan
is
to
discourage
non-meritorious
appeals
--
or
frivolous
appeals
or
non-meritorious
appeals.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
as
i
indicated
sir,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
can
state
outside
the
record
that
we
did
search
florida
legislative
history
and
found
none.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
the
state
says
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
it.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
certainly
sir,
it
could
not
be
--
i'd
hate
to
put
my
native
state
in
the
position
of
exacting
a
tribute
of
$20
--
20
cents
a
day,
a
dollar
a
week
to
repay
the
cost
of
a
$215
transcript
on
an
economic
basis.
and
so
i
think
that
in
the
large
public
policy
area
in
which
this
case
falls,
it
clearly
has
the
–
an
intended
effect
to
discourage
exercising
the
right
to
take
an
appeal
granted
by
the
new
jersey
constitution.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
now,
i
do
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
no
sir,
it
certainly
doesn't.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
what
i
am
saying
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
the
applicant
for
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
is
asked
to
make
a
gamble,
to
take
a
gamble
and
i
think
that
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
fettering
of
the
freedom
of
choice
on
whether
or
not
to
take
an
appeal.
now,
public
policy,
i
think
pervades
the
entire
issue
because
if
penalogically,
it
makes
good
sense
to
pay
whatever
the
minimum
wage
might
be
in
new
jersey
state
prison
at
the
moment
and
the
stipulation
of
facts
indicates
that
with
respect
to
rinaldi,
its
20
cents
a
day.
if
this
is
good
penalogically
speaking,
why
then
should
new
jersey
turn
around
and
permit
the
county
which
laid
out
$215
for
the
transcript
to
take
back
this
20
cents
a
day.
the
state
says,
“well,
we
don't
have
to
pay
him
anyway,
and
therefore,
we're
doing
nothing
more
than
putting
him
in
a
position
where
he
could
be
in
any
case
where
we
not
to
pay
him.”
i
say
that
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
i
may
not
have
stated
it
clearly.
the
state
says
in
its
brief
that
as
a
matter
policy,
internal
state
policy,
we
would
not
have
to
pay
him
while
he's
in
prison,
doing
work.
i
say
that
that
misses
the
mark.
the
fact
is
that
for
what
i
would
deem
good
public
policy
reasons
its
deemed
sound
penologically
to
pay
some
minimum
wage,
here
specifically
20
cents
a
day.
then
to
turn
around
and
say
that
you're
going
to
lose
this
for
four
years
until
you
pay
off
$215
to
the
county
which
afforded
you
this
transcript
so
you
could
take
the
appeal
which
constitutionally
we
give
you,
i
say
is
to
--
if
that
is
really
the
argument
not
--
whether
or
not
we
have
to
pay
him
in
the
first
instance.
now,
i
do
say
quickly
here
that
in
rinaldi's
case,
i
do
not
have
--
i
do
--
i
am
not
able
to
avail
myself
of
the
argument
that
his
choice
as
to
taking
the
appeal
was
impede
--
obviously
he
took
the
appeal.
obviously,
he
took
the
gamble
and
he
lost.
but
i
am
saying
that
now,
he
is
being
deprived
of
his
property
at
the
rate
of
a
dollar
a
week,
$52
a
year
for
four
years.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
you're
asking
sir
what
might
my
view
is
on
a
reimbursement
statute
generally
i
think.
and
i
--
my
answer
to
that
is
this,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
case
generally
but
rather
a
case
of
an
indigent
and
i
think
that
under
our
thinking
as
it
has
evolved
over
the
past
few
years,
this
puts
the
indigent
in
a
position
where
his
choice
at
the
time
of
taking
an
appeal
is
different
from
the
man
who
may
expect
to
come
in
with
some
money
later.
secondly
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
i
think
that
you
could
just
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
could
justify
a
statute
that
was
in
somewhat
of
this
pattern
if
it
conformed
to
a
state
policy
of
repayment
of
debts
by
garnishment.
for
example
in
new
jersey,
we
have
as
i
recall
a
garnishment
statute,
nothing
up
to
$18
a
week,
may
be
garnished
to
repay
a
civil
indebtedness
and
beyond
that
10%
of
compensation.
if
there
were
a
reimbursement
statute
that
was
in
that
vein,
in
that
setting,
i
would
be
prepared
to
say
sir
that
this
would
probably
be
acceptable
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
but
i
come
down
here
to
the
fact
that
we
have
the
indigent
situation
and
we
have
the
great
and
sovereign
state
of
new
jersey
saying
we
are
going
to
do
something
to
restrain
the
multitude
in
these
appeals
that
were
--
we're
being
forced
to
accept
because
this
can
be
the
only
intent
of
the
statute
and
it
is
said
to
be
one
of
intents
by
the
attorney
general.
i
think
this
that
if
we
were
to
have
a
general
garnishment
statute
which
provided
that
sometime
within
the
next
20
years,
the
man
had
a
job,
the
state
would
not
be
barred
by
any
statute
of
limitations.
it
could
pursue
the
collection.
here's
what
concerns
me
further
though
about
this
public
policy
that's
involved
here,
again
in
view
of
the
way
we're
going
today
in
affording
free
transcript
now
in
the
various
states
in
the
federal
level.
counsel
pursuant
to
fee
if
this
kind
of
statutory
pattern
is
permitted
to
exist
and
survive
then
the
policy
having
been
established
cannot
then
--
it'd
be
equally
said
that
with
respect
to
any
fee
that
the
state
must
pay
to
a
counsel,
the
indigent
must
agree
to
pay
this
out
of
this
person's
wages
because
certainly
in
terms
of
policy,
there
could
be
no
distinction
drawn
between
a
transcript
and
counsel
fee.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
the
case
came
down
just
the
end
of
the
year,
as
i
recall
and
it
provided
that
this
is
now
going
to
be
an
obligation
no
longer
born
by
the
legal
profession
alone
but
rather
is
to
be
carried
by
society
generally
within
the
state
of
new
jersey
at
a
rate
that
mr.
chief
justice
weintraub
i
think
even
talked
in
terms
of
the
lawyer's
fee
being
60%
of
what
he
might
ordinarily
get
in
a
regular
case.
so
that
i
do
recognize
that
i
don't
have
with
respect
to
the
narrow
issue
of
joseph
rinaldi,
the
precise
holding
of
griffin
and
the
other
cases
because
he
was
not
deprived
of
his
liberty
by
a
pre-existing
condition
or
a
condition
precedent.
i
say
however
that
he
was
coerced
by
holding
this
appellate
right
before
him,
constitutionally
given
he
was
coerced
into
assigning
all
of
his
prison
wages
and
that
this
is
a
deprivation
of
his
property
and
i
say
further
that
this
statute
is
brought
with
a
public
interest
and
i
think
a
public
danger.
now
additionally,
in
addition
to
the
due
process
argument
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
and
he
also
has
to
think
twice
about
whether
he
can
afford
to
pay
counsel.
that
is
true.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
but
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
i'm
sure
that's
so,
i
know
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
well
it
does,
but
in
a
--
i
had
not
thought
of
it
frankly
sir
in
that
large
sense.
i
believe
that
--
as
a
practicing
attorney,
i
have
been
in
a
position
and
all
of
the
members
of
this
court
i'm
sure
have
been
in
the
position
of
advising
clients
what
it
was
going
to
cost
them
to
take
an
appeal
and
having
clients
lose
their
order
about
taking
an
appeal.
but
how
often
this
is
in
the
civil
field
rather
than
the
criminal
field,
how
often
we
are
faced
with
this
and
have
a
decision
by
a
client
not
to
pursue
his
rights
on
appeal.
in
a
civil
case,
i
would
guess
its
10,
maybe
20
to
1.
i
do
really
think
that
there
is
a
public
policy
involved
here
that
we
should
--
if
we're
going
to
do
something
for
indigents,
we
should
not
then
turn
around
and
take
it
away
from
them.
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
i
had
dealt
with
this
but
not
in
the
sense
in
which
you
put
it
mr.
justice
harlan.
instead
in
the
discovery
period
before
we
made
our
motion
we
had
arrived
at
a
stipulation
of
facts.
and
as
is
set
forth
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
contained
at
page
37
of
the
record
and
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
we
point
out
that
apparently
there
is
a
thinking
that
pervades
the
county
officers
that
the
statute
somehow
best
them
with
a
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
they
can
deduct
from
the
man
who's
in
jail.
now,
the
state
responds
to
this
by
not
really
meeting
the
issue
factually.
they
say,
well,
in
certain
instances
cited
by
appellant's
brief
this
may
have
been
true
or
that
may
have
been
true.
they
don't
deny
that
basic
contention
we
make
that
this
statute
is
not
applied
universally
and
yet
the
statute
is
in
terms
of
shall,
it
is
mandatory,
it
allows
of
no
discretion.
so
i
am
saying
that
in
addition
to
the
basic
due
process
argument
i
urge
that
this
statute
as
applied
to
rinaldi
is
denying
him
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
at
that
point
sir
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
no
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
well
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
well,
i
would
--
i'm
not
sure
what
the
thrust
of
that
is
--
as
you
state
it
but
i
would
turn
it
this
way.
really,
if
--
i
think
it
associates
with
what
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
me
before,
what
does
it
say,
how
does
it
apply?
the
fact
that
it
is
only
applied
in
case
you
lose
i
think
reflects
again
an
attempt
to
discourage
the
frivolous
appeal
and
i
put
"frivolous"
in
quotes
because
what
"frivolous"
is
today,
it
may
not
be
five
years
now.
what
frivolous
was
five
years
ago
or
pre-escobedo,
it
is
not
now.
so
frivolous
is
a
concept
i
do
not
think
we
should
permit
a
state
statute
like
this
to
stand
upon
and
i
do
believe
that
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
statute
that
is
intended
to
penalize
that
you
are
viewing
the
statute
in
the
light
in
which
it
was
intended
to
be
put
on
the
books
and
to
be
enforced.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
first
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
put
by
mr.
justice
brennan
to
mr.
handler.
at
page
42
of
the
record
sir,
there
is
a
form
that
rinaldi
was
required
to
sign
and
this
form
i
think
sir
answers
your
question.
you
wanted
to
know
if
he
was
paid
55
cents
an
hour,
could
they
in
effect
apply
the
garnishment
rate.
instead
the
form
says
all.
whatever
he
makes
if
he
should
go
up
to
a
dollar
a
day,
this
form
implementing
the
statute
demonstrates
the
policy
that
they're
going
to
take
everything
he
makes
until
he
gets
this
indebtedness
paid.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
no
sir
because
that
would
include
the
example
put
to
me
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
in
answering
him,
i
said
that
under
certain
language,
certain
phrasing,
certain
proportion,
i
would
recognize
the
state
had
a
right
to
reimbursement.
i
say
however
that
in
this
particular
case,
this
is
tied
to
the
right
of
appeal
and
i
say
that
this
case
is
a
logical
extension
of
griffin.
it's
tied
to
a
right
to
appeal
that's
tied
to
an
indigent.
it
makes
him
take
the
gamble
and
he
logically
i
would
assume
that
he's
faced
with
the
lengthy
jail
sentence
he's
going
to
take
the
gamble.
but
when
they
thereafter
persuade
him
by
this
means
to
assign
in
full
all
of
his
prison
earnings,
i
say
that
this
is
a
deprivation
of
his
property
without
due
process.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
no
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
on
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
i
want
to
make
that
clear
at
the
outset
mr.
justice
black.
and
i
stated
it
as
forthrightly
as
i
could
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
--
that
we
were
not
arguing
a
deprivation
of
liberty
here
as
was
the
case
in
griffin
and
you're
quite
right
sir
that
we
are
arguing
a
deprivation
of
property.
and
i
am
saying
that
we
are
not
within
the
holding
of
griffin
but
rather
i
am
arguing
a
logical
extension
of
griffin.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
without
due
process,
yes
sir.
namely
the
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
oh,
i
thought
we
were
talking
at
the
moment
about
due
process
with
respect
to
what
he
was
being
--
what
he
had
taken
away
from
him
at
the
moment.
i
said
in
griffin,
i
recognized
that
he
was
being
deprived
of
this
freedom.
in
this
case,
i
said
that
we
were
arguing
that
but
rather
arguing
that
he
was
being
deprived
of
his
property
without
due
process.
now,
additionally,
i
certainly
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
--they
didn't
want
to
waive
that
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir
and
you
--
yes
sir,
and
i
do
recognize.
in
fact,
i
proclaimed
that
inseparable
is
the
equal
protection
argument
in
the
context
of
this
case.
i
think
this
is
what
you're
asking
me
and
my
answer
would
be
that
that
is
exactly
the
point.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
sir,
i'd
be
remissive.
first,
i
didn't
ask
that
you
also
recognize
and
associate
our
own
office
mr.
thomas
campion
who
is
in
the
counsel
table
with
me
who's
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
as
you
must
have
recognized
at
most
of
the
work.
additionally,
justice
--
the
third
circuit,
justice
mclaughlin
was
nice
in
an
opinion
that
he
wrote
up
until
we
came
to
the
decision
line,
i
hope
i
don't
meet
with
the
same
result
here.
thank
you.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
joseph
rinaldi,
the
appellant
in
this
proceeding
is
presently
confined
in
the
new
jersey
state
prison.
he
is
there
following
conviction
and
following
admittedly
and
frankly
an
exhaustion
of
not
only
the
trial
process
but
the
appellate
process
afforded
him
by
the
state
of
new
jersey.
to
that
extent,
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear
at
the
outset,
we
are
not
within
the
precise
holding
of
griffin
and
the
cases
which
follow.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
here
contending
that
because
of
this
financial
obligation
which
i
will
point
out
later,
he
was
asked
to
assume,
he
was
impeded
in
having
either
due
process
with
respect
to
his
freedom
at
the
trial
level
or
due
process
with
respect
to
his
freedom
at
the
appellate
level.
the
position
that
i
take
here,
however,
is
i
believe
a
logical
extension
of
what
this
court
has
held
in
griffin
and
the
other
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
such
as
eskridge,
draper,
burns,
etcetera.
specifically,
rinaldi
following
conviction
at
trial
applied
under
new
jersey
procedures
to
be
permitted
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
to
appeal
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
court.
this
procedure
was
pursued
by
him
and
he
was
permitted
to
so
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.2
(a)
152
section
17
permitted
this
procedure
and
he
availed
himself
of
it.
our
quarrel
is
not
with
17
however
but
with
the
next
section
which
is
section
18.
18
we
say,
provided
a
means
whereby
new
jersey
was
permitted
to
utilize
this
carrot
so
to
speak
of
appellate
procedure
to
coerce
rinaldi
into
making
an
assignment
of
all
of
his
institutional
wages
should
he,
following
this
gamble
of
whether
to
appeal
or
not,
take
the
appeal
and
lose
because
section
18
provides
that
if
the
applicant
for
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
should
have
his
conviction
affirmed
on
appeal,
then
the
cost
of
the
trial
transcript
must
be
taken
from
all
of
his
institutional
wages
until
it
is
paid.
we
say
that
this
constituted
unlike
griffin
which
was
of
course
a
due
process
taking
of
liberty,
but
this
constituted
without
due
process,
a
taking
of
property.
i
think
that
in
the
overall
in
terms
of
the
public
interest
and
quite
aside
from
a
narrow
question
of
joseph
rinaldi,
it
flies
in
the
face
of
what
i
believe
was
a
clearly
articulated
philosophy
of
this
court
that
we
don't
want
to
do
anything
that
will
interfere
with
the
thinking
process
as
to
whether
or
not
an
appeal
should
be
taken.
the
history
of
the
statute,
that
is
the
legislative
history,
is
devoid
of
any
assistance
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
it
was.
however,
the
statute
itself
was
a
specific
answer
to
this
court's
holding
in
the
griffin
case.
the
attorney
general
forthrightly
concedes
that
one
of
the
policy
reasons
behind
the
statute
was
to
discourage
frivolous
appeals.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
1958
sir.
griffin,
i
believe,
was
1956,
yes
sir.
and
the
attorney
general
thus
concede
that
one
of
the
policy
reasons
for
it
mr.
justice
brennan
is
to
discourage
non-meritorious
appeals
--
or
frivolous
appeals
or
non-meritorious
appeals.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
as
i
indicated
sir,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
can
state
outside
the
record
that
we
did
search
florida
legislative
history
and
found
none.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
the
state
says
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
it.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
certainly
sir,
it
could
not
be
--
i'd
hate
to
put
my
native
state
in
the
position
of
exacting
a
tribute
of
$20
--
20
cents
a
day,
a
dollar
a
week
to
repay
the
cost
of
a
$215
transcript
on
an
economic
basis.
and
so
i
think
that
in
the
large
public
policy
area
in
which
this
case
falls,
it
clearly
has
the
–
an
intended
effect
to
discourage
exercising
the
right
to
take
an
appeal
granted
by
the
new
jersey
constitution.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
now,
i
do
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
no
sir,
it
certainly
doesn't.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
what
i
am
saying
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
the
applicant
for
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
is
asked
to
make
a
gamble,
to
take
a
gamble
and
i
think
that
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
fettering
of
the
freedom
of
choice
on
whether
or
not
to
take
an
appeal.
now,
public
policy,
i
think
pervades
the
entire
issue
because
if
penalogically,
it
makes
good
sense
to
pay
whatever
the
minimum
wage
might
be
in
new
jersey
state
prison
at
the
moment
and
the
stipulation
of
facts
indicates
that
with
respect
to
rinaldi,
its
20
cents
a
day.
if
this
is
good
penalogically
speaking,
why
then
should
new
jersey
turn
around
and
permit
the
county
which
laid
out
$215
for
the
transcript
to
take
back
this
20
cents
a
day.
the
state
says,
“well,
we
don't
have
to
pay
him
anyway,
and
therefore,
we're
doing
nothing
more
than
putting
him
in
a
position
where
he
could
be
in
any
case
where
we
not
to
pay
him.”
i
say
that
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
i
may
not
have
stated
it
clearly.
the
state
says
in
its
brief
that
as
a
matter
policy,
internal
state
policy,
we
would
not
have
to
pay
him
while
he's
in
prison,
doing
work.
i
say
that
that
misses
the
mark.
the
fact
is
that
for
what
i
would
deem
good
public
policy
reasons
its
deemed
sound
penologically
to
pay
some
minimum
wage,
here
specifically
20
cents
a
day.
then
to
turn
around
and
say
that
you're
going
to
lose
this
for
four
years
until
you
pay
off
$215
to
the
county
which
afforded
you
this
transcript
so
you
could
take
the
appeal
which
constitutionally
we
give
you,
i
say
is
to
--
if
that
is
really
the
argument
not
--
whether
or
not
we
have
to
pay
him
in
the
first
instance.
now,
i
do
say
quickly
here
that
in
rinaldi's
case,
i
do
not
have
--
i
do
--
i
am
not
able
to
avail
myself
of
the
argument
that
his
choice
as
to
taking
the
appeal
was
impede
--
obviously
he
took
the
appeal.
obviously,
he
took
the
gamble
and
he
lost.
but
i
am
saying
that
now,
he
is
being
deprived
of
his
property
at
the
rate
of
a
dollar
a
week,
$52
a
year
for
four
years.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
you're
asking
sir
what
might
my
view
is
on
a
reimbursement
statute
generally
i
think.
and
i
--
my
answer
to
that
is
this,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
case
generally
but
rather
a
case
of
an
indigent
and
i
think
that
under
our
thinking
as
it
has
evolved
over
the
past
few
years,
this
puts
the
indigent
in
a
position
where
his
choice
at
the
time
of
taking
an
appeal
is
different
from
the
man
who
may
expect
to
come
in
with
some
money
later.
secondly
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
i
think
that
you
could
just
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
could
justify
a
statute
that
was
in
somewhat
of
this
pattern
if
it
conformed
to
a
state
policy
of
repayment
of
debts
by
garnishment.
for
example
in
new
jersey,
we
have
as
i
recall
a
garnishment
statute,
nothing
up
to
$18
a
week,
may
be
garnished
to
repay
a
civil
indebtedness
and
beyond
that
10%
of
compensation.
if
there
were
a
reimbursement
statute
that
was
in
that
vein,
in
that
setting,
i
would
be
prepared
to
say
sir
that
this
would
probably
be
acceptable
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
but
i
come
down
here
to
the
fact
that
we
have
the
indigent
situation
and
we
have
the
great
and
sovereign
state
of
new
jersey
saying
we
are
going
to
do
something
to
restrain
the
multitude
in
these
appeals
that
were
--
we're
being
forced
to
accept
because
this
can
be
the
only
intent
of
the
statute
and
it
is
said
to
be
one
of
intents
by
the
attorney
general.
i
think
this
that
if
we
were
to
have
a
general
garnishment
statute
which
provided
that
sometime
within
the
next
20
years,
the
man
had
a
job,
the
state
would
not
be
barred
by
any
statute
of
limitations.
it
could
pursue
the
collection.
here's
what
concerns
me
further
though
about
this
public
policy
that's
involved
here,
again
in
view
of
the
way
we're
going
today
in
affording
free
transcript
now
in
the
various
states
in
the
federal
level.
counsel
pursuant
to
fee
if
this
kind
of
statutory
pattern
is
permitted
to
exist
and
survive
then
the
policy
having
been
established
cannot
then
--
it'd
be
equally
said
that
with
respect
to
any
fee
that
the
state
must
pay
to
a
counsel,
the
indigent
must
agree
to
pay
this
out
of
this
person's
wages
because
certainly
in
terms
of
policy,
there
could
be
no
distinction
drawn
between
a
transcript
and
counsel
fee.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
the
case
came
down
just
the
end
of
the
year,
as
i
recall
and
it
provided
that
this
is
now
going
to
be
an
obligation
no
longer
born
by
the
legal
profession
alone
but
rather
is
to
be
carried
by
society
generally
within
the
state
of
new
jersey
at
a
rate
that
mr.
chief
justice
weintraub
i
think
even
talked
in
terms
of
the
lawyer's
fee
being
60%
of
what
he
might
ordinarily
get
in
a
regular
case.
so
that
i
do
recognize
that
i
don't
have
with
respect
to
the
narrow
issue
of
joseph
rinaldi,
the
precise
holding
of
griffin
and
the
other
cases
because
he
was
not
deprived
of
his
liberty
by
a
pre-existing
condition
or
a
condition
precedent.
i
say
however
that
he
was
coerced
by
holding
this
appellate
right
before
him,
constitutionally
given
he
was
coerced
into
assigning
all
of
his
prison
wages
and
that
this
is
a
deprivation
of
his
property
and
i
say
further
that
this
statute
is
brought
with
a
public
interest
and
i
think
a
public
danger.
now
additionally,
in
addition
to
the
due
process
argument
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
and
he
also
has
to
think
twice
about
whether
he
can
afford
to
pay
counsel.
that
is
true.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
but
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
i'm
sure
that's
so,
i
know
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
well
it
does,
but
in
a
--
i
had
not
thought
of
it
frankly
sir
in
that
large
sense.
i
believe
that
--
as
a
practicing
attorney,
i
have
been
in
a
position
and
all
of
the
members
of
this
court
i'm
sure
have
been
in
the
position
of
advising
clients
what
it
was
going
to
cost
them
to
take
an
appeal
and
having
clients
lose
their
order
about
taking
an
appeal.
but
how
often
this
is
in
the
civil
field
rather
than
the
criminal
field,
how
often
we
are
faced
with
this
and
have
a
decision
by
a
client
not
to
pursue
his
rights
on
appeal.
in
a
civil
case,
i
would
guess
its
10,
maybe
20
to
1.
i
do
really
think
that
there
is
a
public
policy
involved
here
that
we
should
--
if
we're
going
to
do
something
for
indigents,
we
should
not
then
turn
around
and
take
it
away
from
them.
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
i
had
dealt
with
this
but
not
in
the
sense
in
which
you
put
it
mr.
justice
harlan.
instead
in
the
discovery
period
before
we
made
our
motion
we
had
arrived
at
a
stipulation
of
facts.
and
as
is
set
forth
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
contained
at
page
37
of
the
record
and
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
we
point
out
that
apparently
there
is
a
thinking
that
pervades
the
county
officers
that
the
statute
somehow
best
them
with
a
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
they
can
deduct
from
the
man
who's
in
jail.
now,
the
state
responds
to
this
by
not
really
meeting
the
issue
factually.
they
say,
well,
in
certain
instances
cited
by
appellant's
brief
this
may
have
been
true
or
that
may
have
been
true.
they
don't
deny
that
basic
contention
we
make
that
this
statute
is
not
applied
universally
and
yet
the
statute
is
in
terms
of
shall,
it
is
mandatory,
it
allows
of
no
discretion.
so
i
am
saying
that
in
addition
to
the
basic
due
process
argument
i
urge
that
this
statute
as
applied
to
rinaldi
is
denying
him
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
at
that
point
sir
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
no
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
well
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
well,
i
would
--
i'm
not
sure
what
the
thrust
of
that
is
--
as
you
state
it
but
i
would
turn
it
this
way.
really,
if
--
i
think
it
associates
with
what
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
me
before,
what
does
it
say,
how
does
it
apply?
the
fact
that
it
is
only
applied
in
case
you
lose
i
think
reflects
again
an
attempt
to
discourage
the
frivolous
appeal
and
i
put
"frivolous"
in
quotes
because
what
"frivolous"
is
today,
it
may
not
be
five
years
now.
what
frivolous
was
five
years
ago
or
pre-escobedo,
it
is
not
now.
so
frivolous
is
a
concept
i
do
not
think
we
should
permit
a
state
statute
like
this
to
stand
upon
and
i
do
believe
that
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
statute
that
is
intended
to
penalize
that
you
are
viewing
the
statute
in
the
light
in
which
it
was
intended
to
be
put
on
the
books
and
to
be
enforced.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
first
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
put
by
mr.
justice
brennan
to
mr.
handler.
at
page
42
of
the
record
sir,
there
is
a
form
that
rinaldi
was
required
to
sign
and
this
form
i
think
sir
answers
your
question.
you
wanted
to
know
if
he
was
paid
55
cents
an
hour,
could
they
in
effect
apply
the
garnishment
rate.
instead
the
form
says
all.
whatever
he
makes
if
he
should
go
up
to
a
dollar
a
day,
this
form
implementing
the
statute
demonstrates
the
policy
that
they're
going
to
take
everything
he
makes
until
he
gets
this
indebtedness
paid.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
no
sir
because
that
would
include
the
example
put
to
me
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
in
answering
him,
i
said
that
under
certain
language,
certain
phrasing,
certain
proportion,
i
would
recognize
the
state
had
a
right
to
reimbursement.
i
say
however
that
in
this
particular
case,
this
is
tied
to
the
right
of
appeal
and
i
say
that
this
case
is
a
logical
extension
of
griffin.
it's
tied
to
a
right
to
appeal
that's
tied
to
an
indigent.
it
makes
him
take
the
gamble
and
he
logically
i
would
assume
that
he's
faced
with
the
lengthy
jail
sentence
he's
going
to
take
the
gamble.
but
when
they
thereafter
persuade
him
by
this
means
to
assign
in
full
all
of
his
prison
earnings,
i
say
that
this
is
a
deprivation
of
his
property
without
due
process.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
no
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir,
on
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
i
want
to
make
that
clear
at
the
outset
mr.
justice
black.
and
i
stated
it
as
forthrightly
as
i
could
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
--
that
we
were
not
arguing
a
deprivation
of
liberty
here
as
was
the
case
in
griffin
and
you're
quite
right
sir
that
we
are
arguing
a
deprivation
of
property.
and
i
am
saying
that
we
are
not
within
the
holding
of
griffin
but
rather
i
am
arguing
a
logical
extension
of
griffin.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
without
due
process,
yes
sir.
namely
the
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir.
oh,
i
thought
we
were
talking
at
the
moment
about
due
process
with
respect
to
what
he
was
being
--
what
he
had
taken
away
from
him
at
the
moment.
i
said
in
griffin,
i
recognized
that
he
was
being
deprived
of
this
freedom.
in
this
case,
i
said
that
we
were
arguing
that
but
rather
arguing
that
he
was
being
deprived
of
his
property
without
due
process.
now,
additionally,
i
certainly
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
--they
didn't
want
to
waive
that
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
yes
sir
and
you
--
yes
sir,
and
i
do
recognize.
in
fact,
i
proclaimed
that
inseparable
is
the
equal
protection
argument
in
the
context
of
this
case.
i
think
this
is
what
you're
asking
me
and
my
answer
would
be
that
that
is
exactly
the
point.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
sir,
i'd
be
remissive.
first,
i
didn't
ask
that
you
also
recognize
and
associate
our
own
office
mr.
thomas
campion
who
is
in
the
counsel
table
with
me
who's
--
mr.
frederick
b.
lacey
as
you
must
have
recognized
at
most
of
the
work.
additionally,
justice
--
the
third
circuit,
justice
mclaughlin
was
nice
in
an
opinion
that
he
wrote
up
until
we
came
to
the
decision
line,
i
hope
i
don't
meet
with
the
same
result
here.
thank
you.
