justice
potter
stewart
when
did
this
occur?
justice
potter
stewart
first
day
of
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sonnett,
what
was
the
reference
to
the
disqualification
of
two
prior
judges?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
do
that,
the
statement
that
you
read
a
few
moments
ago
from
a
--
by
a
spokesman
of
afa,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
--
in
this
litigation
or
when
does
that
date
from?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
what
connection
did
he
make
that
statement?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
like
a
letter
from
the
president
of
afa
to
the
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
grinnell?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
get
the
context
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
--
what
kind
of
metropolitan
area
do
you
have
to
have
in
order
to
validate
the
existence
of
a
--
economic
existence
of
a
central
station?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
it
really
doesn't
depend
upon
the
population
of
an
area.
it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
business
and
industry
there,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
were
a
lot
of
warehouses,
or
maybe
i
don't
know,
grain
elevators
or
plants
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
one
hand
or
in
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
office
buildings
or
if
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
department
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
--
in
fact,
how
many
--
how
many
cities
or
metropolitan
areas
are
there
in
which
there
are
one
or
more
accredited
central
stations?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
whole
nation?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
with
an
accredited
central
station?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
agree
with
that
too,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
the
matter
of
not
defending.
and
you
think
they're
both
wrong,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
patents,
valid
live
patents
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
involved
here?
justice
potter
stewart
those
were
based
on
patents.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
this
business
from
which,
mr.
friedman,
about
the
judge
saying
that
he
had
been
forced
to
do
this,
he'd
been
forced
by
the
defendants
to
look
at
these
things,
and
he
gives
--
from
the
test
of
forcing
him
to
do
this,
now,
that
that
just
was
contrary
to
the
fact,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
because
your
case
only
took
an
hour?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
never
did
rule
on
the
defendant's
exceptions
to
that
--
to
the
introduction
of
that
evidence,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
of
any
other
case
where
a
district
judge
in
the
trial
of
a
--
to
any
antitrust
case,
who
is
just
refraining
from
ruling
on
the
defendant's
exceptions
to
introduction
of
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes
but
that's
one
thing.
he
reserved
but
then
he
ruled
on
it.
he
never
did
rule
on
it,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
don't
know
until
now
--
what
it
--
what
he
held
was
admissible
and
what
he
held
was
not
admissible.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
--
it
is
true
isn't
it,
that
in
the
state
of
the
record
after
the
--
in
the
state
of
the
case,
in
the
posture
of
the
case,
after
the
government,
in
one
hour,
have
put
in
some
3500
pages
of
the
evidence,
much
of
which
has
been
objected
too
by
the
defendants.
and
the
court
has
said
the
--
to
take
care
of
those
objections
and
exceptions
later,
the
defendant
at
that
time,
didn't
know
what
kind
of
a
case
they
have
to
meet
because
they
didn't
know
what
evidence
was
in
the
record
against
them.
and
they
don't
know
until
this
day,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
really
it's
not
for
you
to
decide,
that
is
for
the
judge
sitting
in
a
courtroom
to
decide
whether
evidence
is
admissible
or
not,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
judge
never
did
decide
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
you
take
it
and
that
--
but
that
really
isn't
the
way
a
trial
supposed
to
be
run,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
never
did
pass
on
it
insofar
as
--
insofar
as
we
know.
but
you
take
it
that
he
probably
did,
but
you
can't
find
anywhere
in
the
record
any
ruling
by
the
judge
on
the
many
and
various
exceptions
made
by
the
defense
to
the
introduction
of
evidence,
can
you?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps,
it's
the
whole
point,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
we'll
say,
“oh,
good
old
charlie,”
he
just
like
that,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sonnett,
you're
saying
that
that
it's
evident
from
the
record
that
the
court,
at
the
time
he
said
that,
he
had
not
looked
at
the
documents,
can
you
tell
us
where
in
the
record
that
that's
evident?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
they
do
pretrial,
they
had
an
extensive
pretrial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
it
--
does
it
show
in
the
record
that
he
had
not
seen
them,
at
the
time
he
stated
what
you've
said.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sorry,
going
back
for
a
moment
to
the
subject
to
the
colloquy
between
you
and
my
brother
white.
was
mr.
fleming
--
he
was
the
president
of
what
companies?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
--
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
president
of
grinnell
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
a
chairman
of
adt,
chairman
of
the
board?
