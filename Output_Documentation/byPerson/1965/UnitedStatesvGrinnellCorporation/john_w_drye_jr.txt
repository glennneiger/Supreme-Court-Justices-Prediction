mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
as
counsel
for
holmes
electric
protective
company,
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
and
while
i
join
with
counsel
for
grinnell
and
adt
in
pointing
out
that
there
are
errors
in
both
procedure
and
law
and
the
findings
of
the
court
below
which
require
reversing
of
that
decree.
my
main
purpose
here
is
to
urge
that
position
of
holmes
and
irrespective
of
the
outcome
of
this
case,
the
relief
demanded
against
holmes
is
unjustified.
we
feel
that
holmes
has
been
sucked
down
the
drain
by
some
broad
general
findings
of
fact,
in
which
we're
only
included
by
a
very
--
rather
a
different
phrase,
defendants
or
alarm
company
defendants,
and
that
those
--
so
many
of
those
findings
are
not
only
irrelevant
as
to
holmes
but
in
the
cases
where
they
might
apply
that
the
facts
are
wrong.
so
we
believe
that
the
relief
that
is
asked
against
--
the
action
against
holmes
for
these
reasons
which
are
now
discussed
should
be
dismissed.
holmes
is
an
old
and
honorable,
and
respectable
company
in
the
burglary
protection
business.
it
was
formed
in
1858
by
edwin
holmes,
promoter
of
electric
alarm
device
and
by
his
son
who
instigated
the
first
telephone
service
--
exchange,
telephone
exchange
service.
its
business
more
or
less
patterned
along
the
line
of
a
telephone
company.it
installs
its
burglar
alarm
system
on
the
devices
on
the
client's
premises
--
the
messages
are
sent
over,
released
one
of
the
telephone
company,
and
its
central
station
responds.
it
was
in
1905,
holmes
became
a
subsidiary
of
the
new
york
telephone
company
and
it
remained
a
subsidiary
of
the
new
york
telephone
company
until
1950
when
it
was
purchased
by
grinnell
corporation.
our
testimony
is
to
the
effect
that
the
grinnell
corporation
urges
this
stock
as
a
depression-free
investment
because
it
was
engaged
in
supplying
a
highly
evolved
building
industry
and
its
earnings
were
very
badly
affected.
and
that
is
born
out
too
by
the
fact
that
we,
holmes,
sells
nothing
to
grinnell,
it
buys
nothing
from
grinnell,
and
it
has
no
relationship
to
grinnell
except
from
the
standpoint
of
investment.
now
it
has
conducted
the
business
only
in
the
same
way
since
it
was
organized
--
in
the
same
general
pattern
where
it
was
organized
more
than
100
years
ago.
it's
never
been
in
anything
but
a
burglary
alarm
and
holdup
protection
service.
mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
oh,
i
think
it
would.
if
they
have
(inaudible),
they
have
100%
business.
mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
but
i
think
some
evidence
of
that
have
--
mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
i
think
in
that
case
there
would
be
a
combination
of
where
you
had
--
where
you
had
the
--
you
had
to
through
device
usage.
but
that--
mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
well
i
suppose
--
i
--
you
know,
the
variation
in
the
case
is
as
to
what
percent
might
be
a
conclusive
presumption.
but
--
mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
--
i
suppose
90
would
be
in
the
danger
zone,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
well
it
might
be,
but
i
think
there
are
other
factors
that
i
hope
to
point
out
which
i
think
negative
to
that
sort
of
presumption.
in
the
first
place,
holmes
in
my
opinion
is
not
in
the
national
market.
and
there'd
been
no
findings
about
local
markets
or
conditions
in
local
markets.
holmes
has
a
--
only
serves
people
in
new
york
city.
there's
no
service
to
any
customer
or
any
subscriber
across
state
lines.
it
does
have
two
subsidiaries,
neither
of
which
is
the
defendant
in
this
case
which
has
--
operates
a
station
--
two
stations,
philadelphia
and
another
subsidiary,
two
stations
--
one
station
in
pittsburgh.
but
they
don't
operate
across
state
lines
and
they
have
effective
competition
in
all
of
these
three
cities,
but
there
are
no
findings
about
that
as
to
what
the
conditions
are.
and
we're
not
interested
in
this
broad
market
--
of
all
over
the
country.
we're
interested
only
in
the
burglar
alarm
business
in
a
very
small
section
of
the
country.
furthermore,
we're
only
in
a
part
of
the
market,
the
court
had
found.
we
are
not
and
for
over
100
years
have
never
been
anything
but
in
the
burglary
and
holdup
business.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
--
as
far
with
other
business
which
is
thrown
into
this
market.
mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
concern
that
you
shouldn't
but
i'm
suggesting
that
you
consider
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
john
w.
drye,
jr.
no.
i
would
--
i
could
--
it
would
be
foolish
and
naïve
of
me
to
say
that
the
company
couldn't
own
all
the
stock
of
companies
and
compel
them
to
do
what
they
want.
now,
what
is
the
evidence
of
conspiracy
here?
we
have
first
the
stock
ownership
question
which
we
have
discussed.
now
in
my
--
in
my
mind,
i
could
be
as
an
instrument
of
the
improper
use
of
power,
but
there
must
be
some
evidence
of
it
and
there
isn't
any
with
holmes
in
this
case.
there's
no
credible
evidence
that
we
conspire
with
anybody
and
the
only
effort
to
fill
that
gap
is
in
1906
agreement
between
holmes
and
adt
which
is
allegedly
illegal
and
i
think
probably
was.
and
if
you
go
back
to
1905,
a
lot
of
corporate
files,
you'll
find
some
documents
that
don't
really
fit
into
modern
day
thinking.
so
i'm
not
trying
to
defend
that
agreement.
but
that
agreement
was
terminated
in
1947,
or
in
holmes,
it
was
a
subsidiary
of
new
york
telephone
company.
and
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
grinnell
ever
even
knew
of
that
agreement.
they
say
well,
the
agreement
was
terminated
but
you
didn't
go
into
the
fire
alarm
business.
well,
grinnell
for
100
years
hadn't
been
in
the
fire
alarm
business.
it
didn't
want
to
go
into
fire
alarm
business
and
there's
no
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
because
as
you're
going
into
a
new
business,
as
everybody
knows,
involves
the
consideration
of
a
lot
of
very
vital
economic
problems.
it
involves
a
little
bit
of
your
own
knowledge
of
the
business
that
you're
going
into.
then
there
is
a
statement
i
believe
--
obtained
our
position
in
the
market
by
acquisitions.
but
the
holmes
electric
company
has
made
no
acquisitions
in
more
than
30
years.
and
it
has,
even
in
the
distant
past,
no
record
of
any
substantial
acquisitions.
it
is
said
that
some
of
the
defendants
--
the
judge
says,
some
of
the
defendants
operated
a
“loss”,
presumably,
intended
to
confer
the
idea
that
the
“loss”
is
to
keep
competition
out.
but
holmes
never
operated
a
“loss,”
that
it
has
never
operated
a
“loss”
in
any
year.
there's
no
evidence
that
it
ever
kept
out
any
competition
or
that
it
ever
prevented
any
interest
into
the
business.
there's
another
claim
that
we
had
common
pricing
practices,
but
i've
covered
that
in
the
brief
and
i'm
not
going
into
that.
i'd
like
--
do
i
have
--
i
believe
i
have
a
few
minutes.
i'd
like
to
go
to
the
penalty
provision
of
the
decree.
the
divestiture
of
holmes
was
directed
by
the
decree
although
it
was
not
requested
by
the
government.
it's
not
in
--
it's
not
asked
or
in
the
complaint,
while
i
realized
the
broad
power
of
the
court
has
in
fixing
the
decree.
i
think
that
these
facts
which
i
have
shown
indicated
that
that's
not
necessary
to
restore
competition
and
probably
should
be
just
--
divestiture
should
not
be
decreed.
now
i
won't
mention
the
two
provisions
in
the
decree
which
the
government
has
conceded
error
and
which
have
been
preferred
to
(inaudible).
there's
a
prohibition
against
any
acquisitions.
holmes
is
a
small
company.
it
was
bought
by
grinnell
for
$4,256,000
in
1947
for
100%
of
its
stock,
such
a
small
fish
in
the
big
economic
pool.
now
we've
gather
there's
a
provision
in
the
there
that
we
are
forbidden
to
make
any
acquisitions.
well,
i
don't
know
what
posture
we'll
end
up
in
when
this
case
is
over,
but
a
company
as
small
as
holmes
ought
not
to
be
a
burdened
with
any
such
restrictive
provision
as
that.
any
acquisitions
that
makes
ought
to
be
determined
in
the
light
of
the
competition
in
the
area
where
it's
operated
at
the
time
those
things
are
made.
the
second
provision
is
that
--
well,
i'll
have
to
rely
on
my
brief.
my
light
is
on.
thank
you.
