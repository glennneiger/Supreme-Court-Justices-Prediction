mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
20
minutes,
i
plan
to
deal
too
briefly
with
the
difficult
subject
of
market
definition
and
also
with
the
government's
appeal
so
far
as
it
seeks
additional
relief
against
my
client
adt.
while
abandoning
the
district
court's
presumptions
of
monopolization
here,
the
government
does
concede
that
the
sole
basis
for
inferring
monopoly
power
is
the
fact
that
the
alarm
company
defendants
in
1961
accounted
for
87%
of
the
total
revenue
of
accredited
central
stations
including
however
both
insurance
approved
and
unapproved
revenue
by
those
stations
across
the
country.
the
government
urges
that
central
station
services
were
correctly
found
below
to
constitute
a
single
national
market.
basically,
the
government's
argument
is
that
adt
operates
115
central
stations
across
the
country
and
that
it
initially
projects
target
rates
so-called
minimum
basic
rates
based
upon
its
system
wide
cost
experience.
the
defendants
answered
that
the
commercial
realities
of
the
central
station
business
are
such
that
a
local
market
definition
is
compelled
here.
first
of
all,
as
mr.
sonnett
noted,
central
stations
can
furnish
their
services
only
within
a
radius
up
to
25
miles
of
the
station.
other
than
in
a
few
contiguous
cities
across
the
country,
the
result
is
that
a
central
station
in
one
city
is
unable
to
compete
with
the
central
station
in
another
city.
further,
the
cost
of
furnishing
and
the
prices
obtained
for
central
station
services
very
erratically
from
one
city
to
another.
for
example,
adt
has
obtained
average
charges
for
its
services
which
have
varied
as
much
as
60%
from
one
city
to
another.
even
where
adt
serves
some
local
installations
of
so-called
national
accounts
which
insist
that
contracts
be
processed,
that
there
are
central
headquarters
by
legal
security
and
insurance
departments,
those
local
installations
nonetheless
have
local
price
estimates
computed
for
them.
the
prices
determined
there
are
response
to
local
competition,
local
costs.
special
national
rates
or
discounts
are
not
granted.
in
such
circumstances
where
customers
cannot
be
supplied
from
outside
their
locality
and
those
who
furnish
services
or
sell
products
to
them
must
do
so
from
plants
physically
situated
in
the
same
localities,
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
a
local
market
definition
follows.
the
issue
here
is
power
over
price.
this
is
a
section
2
monopoly
case.
the
fact
that
adt
must
respond
to
different
price
levels
almost
as
numerous
as
the
number
of
cities
it
serves
indicates
that
a
local
market
definition
is
controlling
here.
in
addition,
the
very
fact
that
adt
must
respond
to
these
myriad
different
prices
across
the
country,
is
strong
evidence
that
monopoly
power
is
lacking
here.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i'm
not
sure
i
follow.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
adt
makes
some
of
the
equipment
which
it
uses
on
its
devices
and
equipment.
it
buys
that
substantial
part
of
it
from
outside
sources.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
was
an
expressed
concession
by
the
government's
trial
counsel
at
a
pretrial
hearing,
before
this
trial
started,
that
there
was
no
claim
that
adt
or
the
alarm
company
defendants
or
grinnell
included
had
any
monopoly
in
the
equipment
and
devices.
and
uniformly,
the
testimony
of
all
of
the
alarm
company
witnesses
whose
depositions
were
taken
here
was
that
they
have
in
no
way
been
impeded
by
an
unavailability
of
the
equipment
either
to
operate
the
central
station
or
to
service
the
premises
of
the
subscribers.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes
sir,
we
have
mentioned
of
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
specifically
our
reply
brief
was
filed
saturday
sir.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
it
did
mr.
justice
white
until
approximately
1959
or
1960.
adt
then
took
over
the
manufacture
of
the
so-called
sprinkler
supervisory
and
waterflow
devices
which
mr.
sonnett
has
described
which
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no
sir.
i
turn
now
to
the
product
or
service
definition
of
the
market.
the
market
found
below
includes
totally
different
central
station
services,
to
name
them
as
to
show
they
are
different
end
users
--
watchman
reporting,
manual
fire
alarm,
premises
burglary
alarms,
sprinkler
supervisory
systems,
safe
and
vault
alarms,
smoke
detection
alarms,
waterflow
alarms,
holdup
alarms,
and
a
veritable
host
of
so-called
industrial
process
supervisory
services,
each
one
of
which
is
almost
a
tailor-made
installation
dealing
with
such
different
things
as
monitoring
the
temperature
of
the
gluepot
and
so
on
down
the
line.
these
services
differ
radically
not
only
in
end
use,
but
in
the
very
equipment
and
devices
used
placed
upon
the
subscriber's
premises.
they
served
different
types
of
customers,
the
price
and
the
insurance
treatment
obtained
in
connection
with
them
varies
radically
from
one
to
another.
now
the
government
justifies
including
all
of
these
different
central
station
services
in
a
single
market
by
urging
that
central
station
firms
generally
furnished
all
of
these
services
and
that
some
subscribers
may
use
more
than
one
service.
in
fact,
the
record
demonstrates
that
very
few
central
station
firms
offer
all
of
these
services.
but
even
apart
from
that
fact,
we
subject
that
the
government's
basic
theory
is
fallacious
where
the
issue
is
monopoly
power
over
price.
both
the
majority
and
the
descending
opinions
in
cellophane
demonstrate
that
only
where
customers
are
willing
and
able
to
substitute
one
product
or
service
for
another
is
there
even
an
initial
suggestion
that
those
products
and
services
maybe
in
the
same
market.
further
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
fortas,
i'm
using
the
power
over
price
frankly
as
a
shorthand
expression
for
power
over
price
or
competition.
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--
essentially
there
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
frankly,
i
think
there
are
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
majority
opinion
in
cellophane
made
what
i
believe
is
not
only
illogical
but
an
economically
supported
argument
that
in
essence
if
one
has
power
over
competition,
it
evidently
follows
that
he
has
power
over
price,
and
vice
versa.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
either
way,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
your
honor.
further,
cellophane
demonstrates
that
substitute
products
would
be
included
in
the
same
market
must
have
a
price
and
demand
interrelationship,
responsiveness,
and
sensitivity,
the
element
of
cross-elasticity
of
demand.
here,
the
government
has
to
conceive
the
obvious.
customers
just
will
not
substitute
a
fire
alarm
service
for
a
burglar
service
or
for
an
industrial
process
service.
they
can't.
they're
functionally
different.
there
is
no
interchangeability.
further,
these
services
aren't
able
to
compete
with
each
other.one
of
them
has
no
impact
in
terms
of
demand
and
price
upon
another.
now
in
a
monopoly
case,
we
urge
this
court
must
find
that
such
different
end
use
services
just
cannot
be
lumped
together
anymore
than
the
mere
fact
that
heinz
makes
pickles,
catsup,
and
pork
and
beans,
all
processed
in
the
same
plant,
puts
those
products
into
a
single
market
for
purposes
of
determining
power
over
price.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
if
you
can
establish
that
there
is
some
kind
of
a
continuous
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
probably
we
ultimately
get
to
the
point
where
we
are
talking
about
a
kind
of
business,
and
concededly,
the
government
says
we're
talking
about
a
kind
of
business
here
i.e.
central
station
services.
i
think
quite
clearly
if
you
get
to
the
point
where
those
products
which
constitute
the
business
of
the
allegedly
monopolized
business
are
such
that
they
are
sold
together
in
packages
and
so
forth,
and
if
--
to
use
your
hypothetical,
all
outlets
are
closed,
there
is
only
the
single
supplier
or
he
has
95%
of
those
outlets
and
so
forth,
then
yes,
i
think
that
a
strong
inference
of
power
over
price
can
be
drawn.
however
here,
we
have
such
desperate
end
use
services
not
sold
in
packages,
the
price
of
one
does
not
affect
or
vary
the
price
of
the
other.
demand
for
one
does
not
affect
demand
for
another.
there,
i
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes
sir,
i
am
because
my
understanding
of
a
monopoly
inquiry
is
that
the
ultimate
question
to
be
answered
is
what
is
the
power
over
price?
and
here
we
say
that
these
subjects
have
no
bearing
upon
each
other
so
far
as
answering
that
ultimate
inquiry
power
over
price.
for
now
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
i
think
quite
clearly
that
is
the
position
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--
of
my
client,
adt.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
am
attacking
the
finding
of
monopoly
which
is
an
essential
keystone
for
the
section
2
monopolization
findings.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
this
is
true
however,
your
honor,
even
though
they
government
here
makes
no
effort
to
defend
the
presumptions
of
the
district
court,
a
literal
reading
of
the
very
language
that
judge
wyzanski
used
in
defining
his
presumption
to
us
that
he
presumed
the
section
1
violations,
as
well
as
the
section
2
violation,
from
mere
percentage
of
the
market.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
our
argument,
mr.
justice
white
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
such
a
conspiracy.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
in
my
oral
argument
today,
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
time
to
concentrate
only
on
the
monopoly
aspects.
we
have
dealt,
however,
with
the
section
1
restraint
of
trade
contentions
in
our
brief.
they
are
dealt
with
even
more
fully
in
the
briefs
of
the
other
defendants.
now
if
the
furnishing
of
these
different
end
use
services
by
central
station
firms
justifies
including
all
of
them
in
the
same
market
as
the
government
argues,
then
we
contend
that
logically
it
must
follow
that
local
alarm
services,
direct
connected
alarm
services,
telephone
answering
and
proprietary
alarm
systems,
all
of
which
use
exactly
the
same
systems
of
electric
equipment
upon
the
subscriber's
premises
should
also
be
included
in
the
market
for,
as
judge
wyzanski
himself
found,
practically
all
accredited
central
stations
furnished
one
or
more
of
these
other
forms
of
protection
as
well
as
others
like
watchman
service.
in
point
of
fact,
the
defendants
do
not
make
that
extreme
argument.
we
do
not
urge
that
every
dollar
of
business
in
every
one
of
these
other
forms
of
protection
competes
for
every
dollar
of
accredited
central
station
business.
we
do
claim
however
that
this
record
shows
that
in
essentially
all
of
their
users,
accredited
central
station
services
do
need
effective
competition
from
one
or
more
other
forms
of
protection.
we
claim
that
even
if
the
government
did
not
have
the
burden
of
proving
monopoly,
the
record
here
shows
the
reasonable
interchangeability
or
cross-elasticity
of
demand
required
by
cellophane.
i'd
like
to
point
out
what
i
believe
is
the
principal
difference
between
the
government
and
the
defendants
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
i.e.
whether
the
market
assuming
that
the
different
end
services
can
be
lumped
together,
properly
excludes
all
other
forms
of
protection.
the
government
relies
solely
upon
alleged
differences,
product
differentiation
between
accredited
central
station
services
and
other
forms
of
protection
including
unaccredited
central
stations
which
furnished
the
same
services
but
without
insurance
accreditation.
the
briefs
of
the
parties
on
both
sides
deal
at
length
with
this
question,
although
the
government
offers
no
customer
testimony
or
evidence
in
support
of
its
views
as
to
the
extent
of
these
differences,
the
only
significant
view
must
be
that
of
customers
as
to
how
different
accredited
central
stations
services
and
other
forms
of
protection
are.
and
that
customer
judgment
will
be
reflected
in
the
degree
of
cross-elasticity
which
is
the
ultimate
calculus,
the
lowest
common
denominator
in
a
market
definition
inquiry
of
the
kind
which
confronts
us
here.
though
the
government
refuses
to
discuss
it,
evidence
of
cross-elasticity
appears
throughout
the
record
here,
not
only
do
customers
similarly
situated
consider
alternatives
and
regularly
make
different
elections
between
accredited
central
station
services
and
other
forms
of
protection,
but
a
marked
price
response
and
sensitivity
are
shown.
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i'd
like
to
deal
briefly
with
some
numbers.
at
pages
1801-12
of
the
printed
record,
for
the
city
of
indianapolis,
the
government
has
printed
a
total
of
12
adt
competition
reports.
their
purpose
is
to
show
that
adt
meets
competition
only
in
the
form
of
accredited
central
stations.
these
12
reports,
the
entire
total
for
the
city
of
indianapolis
selected
by
the
government
here,
deal
with
adts
having
to
reduce
its
prices
in
competition
with
american
alarm
company.
now
concededly,
american
alarm
company
today
has
an
accredited
central
station.
but
significantly,
11
of
the
12
reports
selected
by
the
government
deal
with
periods
of
time
when
american
alarm
was
not
an
accredited
central
station
and
yet
adt,
at
these
dates
in
1957,
1958,
1959,
before
american
became
accredited
on
may
5th,
1960,
adt
had
to
reduce
its
prices
in
competition.
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
which
permeates
this
record
in
which
the
government
has
to
date
refused
to
discuss
and
which
was
totally
ignored
by
judge
wyzanski.
these
reports
contain
such
illuminating
little
notations
contemporaneously
made
by
adt
salesmen
as
“we've
been
loosing
customers
and
old
subscribers
to
the
american
alarm
company
at
an
alarming
rate
because
of
price.”
now
these
are
the
government's
own
exhibits.
looking
at
these
competition
reports
of
adt
on
a
broader
basis,
they
showed
that
adt
had
to
“reduce
prices
in
some
14,000
transactions
and
negotiations
over
a
roughly
eight-year
period
where
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
my
point
is
that
the
competition
which
they
say
is
not
competition
is
what
was
being
met
here,
i.e.
competition
other
than
from
an
accredited
central
station.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
make
this
argument
interestingly
enough,
not
in
support
of
market
definition,
not
in
support
of
whether
or
not
there's
monopoly
power,
but
solely
in
terms
of
that
something
more,
the
conduct
which
must
be
added
to
monopoly,
to
add
up
to
monopolization.
they
say
that
this
was
exclusionary
restrictive
conduct
in
the
part
of
adt.
as
our
reply
brief
sets
forth
however,
their
theory
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
alright
sir.
i
must
turn
very
quickly
to
the
issue
of
relief.
however,
i
do
urge
that
in
our
briefs,
we
have
set
forth
what
we
think
is
most
convincing
evidence
of
a
substantial
degree
of
cross-elasticity
of
demand
here.
we
think
this
is
the
significant
inquiry
and
should
be
dispositive
on
the
issue
of
monopoly.
in
its
appeal
for
additional
relief,
the
government
seeks
to
require
adt's
relinquished
title
to
these
protection
systems
which
are
placed
upon
subscriber's
premises.
the
government
claims
that
title
retention
was
an
important
part
of
the
pattern
of
monopolization
that
they
see
here.
the
court,
however,
below
made
no
such
finding.
to
the
contrary,
the
court
found
that
title
retention
is
the
norm
in
the
central
station
business.
as
in
fact,
it
is
throughout
the
entire
electric
protection
industry.
the
briefs
by
the
defendant
show
what
we
think
are
some
reasons
why
all
alarm
companies
in
the
years
passed
have
kept
and
have
indeed
been
required
by
the
insurance
rating
agencies
to
keep
title
to
these
systems.
but
there
is
an
even
better
reason
why
the
request
of
the
government
should
not
be
granted
here.
requiring
subscribers
to
buy
adt
systems
will
not
promote
competition.
it
will
merely
preclude
adt
from
competing
because
competitors
not
similarly
bound
can
inevitably
offer
more
favorable
price
terms
to
subscribers,
spreading
the
cost
of
the
system
over
the
term
of
their
entire
relationship
with
the
subscriber.
now
there
are
many
cities
where
adt
today
has
only
one
accredited
central
station
competitor.
the
government
conceives
there
are
many
natural
monopoly
cities
where
today
only
one
central
station
can
be
sustained,
but
as
they
grow
and
become
able
to
sustain
a
second
station,
there
will
be
only
one
competitor
there
with
adt.
we
ask
this
court,
is
it
to
the
public
interest
in
such
circumstances
to
in
effect
deprive
the
public
of
adt's
competition
by
in
effect
locking
them
out
because
they
are
required
to
sell
their
systems
as
a
predicate
to
serving
a
customer.
my
time
is
up
mr.
chief
justice.
