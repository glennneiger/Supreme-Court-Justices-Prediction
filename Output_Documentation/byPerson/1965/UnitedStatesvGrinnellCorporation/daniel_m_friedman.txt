mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
just
like
to
outline
what
i
propose
to
cover
in
my
argument.
my
argument
really
is
broken
down
into
five
points.
first,
i
would
like
to
state
in
some
greater
detail,
the
facts
of
the
case.
and
then
i
propose
to
discuss
the
relevant
market
both
the
product
and
the
geography
of
it.
and
then
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
substantive
violations,
then
i
shall
discuss
the
relief,
and
finally
i
shall
consider
the
claim
that
judge
wyzanski
advised
in
prejudice
and
denied
the
defendants
a
fair
trial.
now
coming
to
the
facts
basically
with
the
facts
involved,
are
the
means
by
which
the
defendants
acquired
and
maintained
their
share
of
the
market.
and
we
started
that
it
had
been
indicated
back
early
in
the
century
with
a
series
of
restrictive
agreements
by
which
the
defendants
divided
up
the
country
in
terms
of
geographic
markets
and
in
terms
of
the
services
which
they
were
providing.
these
agreements
by
the
way,
we're
not
just
in
formal
understanding.
it's
a
formal
written
contract
embodying
these
understandings.
the
first
one
has
been
referred
to
as
an
agreement
in
1906
which
is
known
as
the
burglar
alarm
agreement.
that
was
between
adt
and
holmes.
and
the
--
under
this
agreement,
adt
transferred
its
burglar
alarm
business
in
the
middle
atlantic
states
of
the
country
to
holmes
and
agreed
that
it
would
not
engage
in
burglar
alarm
service
in
those
cities.
holmes
at
the
same
time
agreed
that
it
would
restrict
itself
to
burglar
alarm
cities
in
those
areas.
now
the
next
year,
was
a
series
of
complex
agreements
which
were
known
locally
as
the
fire
alarm
agreements.
the
parties
to
those
agreements
were
grinnell,
which
should
not
been
a
party
to
the
burglar
alarm
agreement,
adt,
another
company
whose
rights
under
this
agreement
adt
acquired
six
years
later
in
1911,
and
afa.
and
the
end
results
of
these
agreements
were
as
follows.
afa
received
the
exclusive
right
to
provide
certain
types
of
fire
alarm
services
in
three
cities
--
new
york,
philadelphia,
and
boston.
and
it
agreed
in
turn
that
it
would
not
engage
in
the
burglar
alarm
business
in
those
cities,
and
also
that
it
would
stay
out
of
the
central
station
business
generally
throughout
the
rest
of
the
united
states.
adt
in
turn
was
given
the
exclusive
right
except
for
those
services
in
those
cities
to
provide
central
station
service
throughout
the
united
states
but
of
course,
that
right
in
turn
was
qualified
by
the
limitation
under
the
1906
agreement
with
holmes,
that
adt
would
not
provide
burglar
alarm
service
in
those
three
cities
allotted
to
it.
grinnell
agreed
to
supply
certain
of
the
devices
which
was
used
in
providing
the
fire
alarm
service,
and
in
return
for
this,
grinnell
was
to
receive
25%
of
the
revenues
generated
by
the
fire
alarm
services
for
which
it
provided
the
devices.
the
fire
alarm
agreement
in
terms
executed
in
1907
was
to
run
until
1954.
the
burglar
alarm
agreement
had
no
termination
date
but
they
were
terminated
by
the
parties
in
1947.
but
the
significant
thing
to
us
is
that
after
these
agreements
ended,
the
parties
continued
to
observe
the
identical
restrictions
that
had
been
contained
in
them.
in
other
words,
17
years
after
the
burglary
alarm
agreement
was
terminated,
10
years
after
the
fire
alarm
agreement
ended
by
its
own
terms,
what
we
find
isn't
judge
wyzanski
found.
afa
was
continuing
to
limit
itself
to
fire
alarm
service
into
the
three
cities
--
in
the
three
cities
in
which
it
had.
holmes
was
limiting
itself
to
burglar
alarm
service
in
the
three
cities
which
it
had
and
adt
was
freed
of
the
competition
of
these
two
companies
throughout
the
united
states.
now
adt
--
afa
--
mr.
--
my
colleague
is
saying
that
afa
has
shown
no
connection
with
us,
afa
itself
has
recognized
the
part
these
agreements
played
in
helping
adt
to
develop
and
gain
the
share
of
the
market.
in
1954,
when
these
fire
alarm
agreements
terminated,
adt
and
afa
continued
the
arrangement
they
had
had
for
sharing
of
revenues.
and
some
years
later,
a
disagreement
arose
between
the
two
companies.
adt
was
contending
that
afa
had
not
contributed
enough
to
the
revenues
to
warrant
its
share
that
it
was
receiving.
and
in
response
--
and
they
wrote
a
letter
to
the
president
of
grinnell,
mr.
fleming,
complaining
about
this.
and
in
response
to
this,
the
president
of
afa
wrote
to
the
president
of
grinnell
explaining
that
in
fact,
this
gave
a
distorted
picture
of
it
because
afa
had
made
another
contribution,
an
important
contribution.
let
me
read
to
the
court
at
record
1484
to
1485,
what
the
president
of
afa
explains
this
contribution
was
and
this
is
what
he
said.
“the
geographic
restrictions
placed
upon
us,
plus
the
requirement
that
we
confine
our
activities
to
sprinkler
and
fire
alarm
service
exclusively
since
1907
and
presumably
into
the
future,
has
definitely
retarded
our
expansion
in
the
past
to
the
benefit
of
adt
growth.”
automatic,
that's
the
full
name
of
afa,
is
still
denied
the
right
of
future
expansion
into
existing
and
new
fields
of
protection
services
born
of
normal
business
progress.
automatic's
contribution
must
also
include
the
many
things
which
help
make
adt
big
and
continues
to
do
so.
so
that
we
think
the
afa
itself
has
recognized
that
one
of
the
most
important
sources
of
the
power
of
these
companies,
that
the
share
--
their
share
of
the
market
and
particularly
of
adt's
73%
share
of
the
market,
where
these
restrictive
agreements
which
eliminated
all
competition
to
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
mr.
justice,
let
me
explain
our
position.
we
think
that
adt
itself,
which
is
the
largest
share
of
the
market
itself
has
monopoly
power.
but
to
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
has
73%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
that
that
has
monopoly
power
itself
and
we
show
that
most
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
relating
to
the
exclusionary
and
restrictive
practices
does
involve
adt.
but
then
we
say
that
the
market
power
having
been
obtained
and
maintained
through
these
exclusive
--
exclusionary
practices,
when
grinnell
came
and
put
the
three
companies
together,
and
then
i
shall
demonstrate
in
a
moment
one
effect
of
this
was
to
restrict
competition
between
them,
that
that
combination
inherent,
if
i
may
say
so,
strengthens
the
monopoly,
perpetuated
the
monopoly,
and
gave
it
an
even
greater
control
of
the
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
we
do
treat
them
on
both
levels.
i
would
say
--
let
me
see
if
i
could
put
it
this
way
that
we're
not
saying
that
--
we're
not
--
we
say
that
grinnell
--
grinnell,
when
it
acquired
these
companies,
with
this
share
of
the
market
and
when
they
continued
to
observe
many
of
the
same
practices
by
which
they
have
shared
the
market,
grinnell
is
therefore
responsible
for
the
continuation
of
this
monopoly
power.i
think
this
is
our
theory.
and
this
also
will
come,
as
i
come
to
a
little
later,
we
think
some
of
these
elements
are
significant
in
defining
the
national
market
too.
and
i
think
it's
all
kind
of
tied
together
here.
but
we
do,
as
i
say,
we
do
--
we
do
treat
them
in
one
sense
both
individually
and
jointly.
now,
i'd
like
to
come
to
another
source
of
the
market
power
of
the
companies
which
is
the
fact
of
acquisitions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
afa,
the
president.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
1959.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
a
dispute
between
afa
and
adt
as
to
the
proper
sharing
of
revenues.
and
adt
complained
to
the
president
of
grinnell,
mr.
fleming
that
afa
was
getting
too
bigger
share
for
what
it
contributed.
and
in
response
to
this,
the
president
of
afa
said,
“no,
we're
not
because
look
what
we
have
contributed.
we
have
enabled
adt
to
grow
big
by
staying
out
of
their
territory.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
yes
it
was
a
letter
i
believe,
1495
of
the
record.
there
was
an
exchange
correspondence
between
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
now,
the
acquisitions
since
1907,
adt
has
purchased
the
stock
or
assets
of
27
companies,
in
either
the
fire
or
the
burglar
alarm
business.
and
holmes
has
purchased
the
stock
or
assets
of
three
burglar
alarm
companies
which
were
in
the
central
station
business
in
new
york.
in
case
--
of
several
of
these
acquisitions,
the
sellers
gave
long-term
covenants
not
to
compete.
there
had
been
an
instance
or
two
when
adt
dismantled
the
plants
of
these
companies
after
the
acquisition.
now,
not
all
of
these
admittedly
were
in
the
central
station
business.
their
opponents
make
a
great
point
of
this.
they
say
many
of
them
were
not
in
the
relevant
market.
but
the
record
indicates
in
this
case
that
the
way
companies
frequently
get
into
the
central
station
business
is
they
start
with
something
else.
and
they
may
start
with
so-called
local
burglar
alarms,
an
alarm
that
rings
on
the
outside
of
the
building.
then
if
they
find
the
demand
growth
and
their
financing
reaches
the
point,
they
go
into
a
central
station.
so
that
in
effect
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
fact
of
the
acquisition
you
mean?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
because
--
well
it's
true,
the
central
stations
may
--
the
people
in
the
business
may
move
up
into
a
more
advanced
type
of
service,
we
think
that
the
service
itself,
the
accredited
central
station
service
is
efficiently
distinct
from
the
others
that
it
maybe
treated
as
an
appropriate
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
varies
apparently.
we
had
suggested
in
the
trial
below
that
$125,000
in
annual
revenues
would
be
sufficient.
the
defendants
dispute
this.
and
there
are
some
central
stations
with
far
more
revenues
than
that
that
are
not
operating
properly.
it
has
to
be
apparently
a
fairly
large
metropolitan
area
because
you
have
to
have
enough
of
the
volume
of
business
to
justify
this.
if
the
courts
vary
also
because
depending
on
how
widespread
it
is,
if
you
have
six
customers
in
one
building,
it
would
be
much
more
economical
than
if
you
have
one
customer
in
each
of
six
buildings.
so
i
can't
state
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
grain
elevators.
a
large
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
large
amount
of
it
--
this
service
is
provided
to
the
mercantile
establishments,
jewelry
stores,
clothing
stores
and
so
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
department
stores,
yes.
so,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
i
can
give
you
any
general
answer
and
general
terms.
it
has
to
depend
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
around
130
your
honor,
but
now,
they're
more
than
that.
now,
there
are
150
--
about
150
at
the
present,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
throughout
the
whole
nation.
adt
has
115
of
them.
and
i
think
of
the
115
central
station
--
115
cities,
but
there
are
more
central
stations,
121
and
i
think
31,
some
number
like
that,
additional
cities.
now
another
thing
pointing
out
in
connection
with
the
acquisitions
is
that
even
after
grinnell
had
acquired
its
interest
in
these
companies,
they
continued
to
attempt
to
make
acquisitions
and
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought,
each
of
the
three
defendant
alarm
companies,
had
outstanding
offer
to
acquire
one
of
the
largest
companies.
now
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
pricing
policies
followed
by
adt,
the
largest
of
these
companies.
adt
publishes
something
it
calls
minimum
basic
rates.
these
are
set,
as
the
vice
chairman
of
the
board
of
adt
testified,
at
a
level
which
is
it's
hoped
will
produce
an
overall
return
of
6%,
after
taxes,
on
the
value
of
the
devices
that
adt
has
installed.
now
the
charge
that
adt
makes
for
its
services
consists
of
two
elements.
first,
there's
something
they
call
the
installation
charge
and
then
an
annual
service
charge.
and
the
record
shows
that
when
adt
found
itself
in
competitive
situations,
it
made
very
deep
slashes
in
these
charges.
adt
has
outstanding
instructions
to
its
district
sales
managers
that
they
may
cut
in
order
to
meet
competitive
situations
up
to
40%
of
their
standard
installation
charge
and
up
to
20%
of
their
annual
service
charge.
but
the
record
shows
that
the
cuts
went
much
deeper
than
that.
the
record
shows
instances
where
adt
made
installations
without
any
charge,
where
adt
produced
their
annual
charges
by
as
much
as
50%
to
70%.
and
indeed
there
were
some
instances
where
they
combined
a
50%
to
70%
reduction
in
annual
charges
with
free
installation.
now
the
salesman's
reports
which
adt
required
in
every
case
where
there
was
a
reduction
in
the
annual
charges,
installation
or
annual
charges,
frequently
would
refer
to
the
fact
that
these
reductions
should
be
accepted
by
the
home
office
because
of
the
effect
it
would
have
in
excluding
competition.
they
pointed
out
that
it
was
desirable
because
it
would
prevent
a
competitor
from
gaining
a
whole
access
to
a
particular
customer,
to
a
particular
area.
and
sometimes
they
stress
the
fact
that
by
signing
a
customer
up
for
five
years,
they
kept
competitors
out.
let
me
just
read
to
the
court
two
or
three
of
these
to
give
the
flavor.
one
salesman
suggests
in
taking
a
reduction,
record
1749,
in
order
to
keep
competitor
out
of
this
growing
chain,
another
one,
we
were
most
anxious
to
block
robinson's
first
move
into
camden,
and
another
one
competitor
is
very
anxious
to
get
a
foothold
in
this
building
of
wholesale
(inaudible).
and
i
think
particularly
revealing,
it's
a
document
in
the
record,
a
statement
in
1956
by
a
vice
president
of
adt,
explaining
why
they
had
decided
to
renew
a
contract
with
rko
studios
in
hollywood
for
10
years
at
a
reduction
in
the
previous
charges,
and
he
explained
it
as
follows.
this
is
2118
of
the
record.
he
said,
“if
this
was
the
best
deal
possible,
we
would
take
it
in
order
to
keep
morris
--,”
that's
another
central
service
station,
“--
in
order
to
keep
morris
out
of
the
motion
picture
studio
business.”
if
the
morris
people
got
rko
studios,
one
of
the
majors,
they
would
have
their
foot
in
the
door
so
to
speak
and
would
have
a
weapon
to
use
in
soliciting
other
studios.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
reason
i
think
mr.
justice
is
when
it's
done
by
somebody
who
has
this
share
of
the
market,
when
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
there
is,
mr.
justice.
these
people
did
have
a
very
large
share
of
the
market.
the
record
shows
consistent
price
cutting
to
meet
competition.
the
record
also
shows,
i
may
say,
that
in
these
cities
where
they
did
not
have
any
accredited
central
station
competition,
that
they
were
able
generally
to
get
a
much
higher
percentage
of
their
minimum
basic
rates
than
in
the
area
where
they
did
have
accredited
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
our
burden
isn't
that
hard.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
show
that
they
have
actually
used
dominant
power
to
exclude
competition.
i
think
it's
enough
if
we
show
they
have
the
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
our
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice,
our
theory
of
the
case
is
the
first
suggestion
that
if
the
national
power,
it's
the
power
they
have
which
enables
them
when
it
is
appropriate
in
particular
areas,
to
cut
as
deeply
as
they
think
appropriate.
that's
our
basic
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
and
this
does
of
course
get
into
the
question
which
i
will
turn
to
in
a
minute,
relevant
both
to
the
product
market
and
the
geographical
market.
now
i'd
just
briefly
like
to
refer
to
one
or
two
other
instances
of
means
which
have
enabled
adt
to
retain
its
position.
there
are
in
this
record
a
few
instances,
not
many,
of
cases
where
adt
actually
threatened
competitors
that
it
would
bring
to
bear
its
power.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
three
or
four
of
them
and
they've
suggested
that
if
a
competing
company
didn't
behave
itself,
they
could
bring
to
bear
this
enormous
and
economic
power
that
they
had.
there
are
few
other
instances
where
adt
has
opened
a
new
central
service
station
and
the
record
shows
that
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
that
was
because
they
believe
this
would
have
the
effect
of
blocking
a
competitor.
now
there's
also
reference
to
the
question
of
retaining
title
to
the
installations.
the
significance
of
that
is
tied
up
with
the
way
in
which
this
service
is
sold,
that
is
its
price
is
composed
of
a
combination
of
an
installation
charge
and
a
service
charge.
because
at
the
end
of
the
five-year
contract,
if
a
customer
is
dissatisfied
with
adt
and
would
like
to
go
to
someone
else
or
if
someone
else
offers
them
a
cheaper
arrangement,
adt
if
it
loses
the
business,
removes
all
of
the
equipment.
and
this
means
that
a
competing
seller
of
this
service
has
to
quote
the
customer
a
double
charge,
an
installation
charge
plus
a
service
charge
whereas
adt,
if
it
continues
merely
has
the
service
charge.
and
there
is
indication
of
at
least
two
people
who
testified
to
central
service
station
operators
that
they
found
it
very
difficult
and
sometimes
almost
impossible
to
try
to
solicit
existing
customers
of
adt
for
that
reason.
now
this
is
the
background,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
definition
of
the
market
which
i
think
we
agree
with
the
defendants
is
the
critical
issue
in
this
case.
and
i'd
like
to
discuss
first
the
relevant
product
market
and
secondly,
the
relevant
geographical
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
record
does
not
show
what
led
to
this
action
but
i'd
be
happy
to
advice
you
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it's
not
in
the
record,
mr.
justice.
we're
dealing
here
of
course
with
--
the
product
we're
dealing
here
is
the
service,
protecting
people
against
hazards
giving
them
warning.
and
in
numerous
respects,
the
so-called
accredited
central
station
service
we
think
is
noticeably
superior
to
other
forms
of
protection.
there
are
two
particular
aspects
of
this
i'd
like
to
stress.
the
first
thing
is
that
only
this
type
of
service
gives
a
warning
not
only
of
the
hazard
but
also
of
some
malfunctioning
of
the
equipment
itself.
in
other
words,
it's
not
enough
to
have
on
the
plant
--
on
the
premises
of
burglar
alarm
system
if
in
fact
when
a
burglar
breaks
in
it's
not
going
to
ring.
and
ordinarily,
you
don't
know,
there
maybe
something
wrong
with
the
circuit,
there
maybe
--
parts
may
have
worn
out
or
so
on.
similarly,
you
could
have
a
splendid
sprinkler
alarm
system,
but
if
there's
a
fire
and
the
sprinkler
heads
don't
go
off,
the
water
pressure
isn't
adequate,
it
doesn't
do
you
any
good.
now
this
system
is
--
these
systems
are
devised
so
that
they
give
a
signal
not
only
if
there's
a
fire,
that
is
if
the
sprinkler
goes
off
or
if
there's
an
attack
on
the
premises,
but
also
if
there's
any
malfunctioning
in
the
system.
now
you
have
protection
here,
a
double
protection,
you're
protected
against
hazard
and
you're
also
protected
against
the
possibility
that
the
system
will
not
work
at
a
critical
time.
now
there's
another
respect
to
which
this
system
is
very
important
and
very
desirable.
that
is
that
this
really
is
the
only
kind
of
a
system
that
gives
the
customer
any
guarantee
that
in
the
event
of
alarm,
something
is
going
to
be
done
about
it.
under
the
certification
procedures
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment,
in
order
to
be
accredited,
a
central
station
has
to
meet
a
lot
of
different
tests.
and
one
requirement
is,
that
there'd
be
available
on
the
premises
at
all
times,
a
sufficient
number
of
trained
personnel
to
be
able
to
respond
to
an
emergency.
and
when
an
alarm
comes
in,
you
know
these
people
will
respond
and
will
do
it
promptly.
on
the
other
hand,
some
of
these
other
systems
that
are
involved
don't
give
this
guarantee.
for
example,
a
burglar
alarm,
they
ring
in
the
middle
of
town,
in
the
middle
of
the
morning,
perhaps
someone
will
come
around
and
do
something,
perhaps
someone
won't.
there's
also
--
there's
another
type
of
service
they
have
where
they
connect
the
alarm
system
to
either
of
the
police
headquarters
or
fire
department.
but
these
indications
are
frequently,
as
these
alarms
come
in,
the
police
may
not
immediately
respond
to
this
one.
they
may
say,
“oh,
we've
had
a
lot
of
things.”
for
example,
apparently,
a
heavy
windstorm,
the
glass
may
shake
and
that
maybe
enough
to
activate
an
alarm.
well,
these
people
can
tell
what
the
cause
is.
the
police
may
say,
“oh,
we
had
too
much
stuff
like
that
recently.
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it.”
now,
the
one
group
it
would
seem
to
me
that
is
preeminently
qualified
to
evaluate
the
quality
of
these
systems
is
the
insurance
industry.
that's
their
business
--
evaluating
hazards.
and
that
industry
has
clearly
recognized
the
superior
quality
of
these
systems.
that
the
underwriters
laboratories
and
various
rating
bureaus
have
promulgated
very
detailed
standards
governing
all
aspects
of
central
station
service.
it
involves
the
kind
of
a
building
they
must
have,
the
kind
of
equipment
they
must
have,
the
number
of
personnel
available,
their
requirements
for
different
classes
of
service
that
the
guards
must
be
able
to
reach
the
spot
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
and
also,
a
very
detailed
requirement
as
to
precisely
the
kind
of
equipment
and
the
kind
of
protection
on
the
subscriber's
premises.
there
are
two
aspects
to
this.
the
first
thing
is
the
central
station
itself
must
be
approved
by
the
insurance
underwriters
to
become
a
certificated
--
a
certified
station.
and
after
that,
the
next
step
is
that
the
central
station
in
turn
can
grant
accreditation
to
a
particular
installation
of
the
subscriber.
now,
accredited
service
generally
qualifies
for
larger
discounts
on
insurance
than
non-accredited
service.
and
this
seems
to
us
is
the
clearest
example
of
the
high
regard
which
the
insurance
company
has
for
this
service.
indeed,
the
evidence
indicates
that
in
the
field
of
burglar
alarms,
roughly
one
half
of
the
subscribers,
little
more
little
less,
do
not
get
a
certificate
for
their
own
installation.
they
go
and
get
service
from
an
accredited
company
but
they
do
not
pay
the
additional
amount
which
is
necessary
to
get
the
special
types
of
protection,
a
broader
coverage
which
the
certificate
gives.
well,
this
it
seems
to
us,
and
therefore
they
are
not
eligible
--
not
be
eligible
for
the
discounts
on
this,
this
it
seems
to
us
indicates
that
these
customers
recognized
the
advantages
in
having
service
provided
by
an
accredited
company
even
though
they
don't
get
the
discounts
that
would
be
available
if
they
went
a
step
beyond.
now
the
record
also
indicates,
that
frequently,
insurance
companies
have
insisted
that
subscribers
get
accredited
service
before
they're
willing
to
give
them
any
insurance
coverage.
another
example
we
think
of
the
customer
recognition
of
the
superiority
of
this
service
is
the
district
court's
finding
that
when
customers
do
shift
from
one
type
of
service
to
the
other,
the
preponderance
shift
is
equal.
the
preponderance
shift
is
from
the
other
forms
of
service
to
this
particular
type
of
service.
in
other
words,
we
don't
have
customers
as
you
might
expect
if
the
services
were
relatively
immaterial
to
them
in
terms
of
quality
and
they
were
motivated
primarily
by
price.
we
don't
have
customers
generally
shifting
back
and
forth
here.
generally,
they
start
with
one
and
when
they
shift,
they
shift
to
what
they
obviously
consider
to
be
the
superior
service
because
they
are
paying
more
for
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
i
think
depending
on
--
we
start
with
the
fact
that
if
two
products
are
very
much
alike,
that
it's
relatively
immaterial
to
the
customer
which
one
he
take,
prices
obviously
is
going
to
be
the
determinative
factor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
their
argument.
of
course
--
i
mean
that
there
are
always
substitutes
available.
but
the
quite
issue
in
defining
the
market
under
the
antitrust
laws
is
that
what
point
you
cut
off
the
substitute.
now,
it
seems
to
me
--
i
mean
the
court
suggested
in
cellophane,
its
reasonable
interchangeability
--
use,
quality,
and
price
considered.
i
mean
it
is
a
vague
thing,
there
are
no
hard
and
fast
lines,
it's
a
matter
of
degree
obviously.
but
in
this
case,
the
district
court,
we
think,
was
justified
in
concluding
that
in
view
of
the
various
distinctions
between
these
type
of
products
that
the
accredited
central
station
service
is
an
appropriate
market
for
testing
the
existence
of
monopoly
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
that
this
is
the
process
that
consumers
always
go
through
whenever
they
make
their
mind
up.
for
example,
if
i
may
refer
to
the
international
boxing
case,
i
suppose,
if
someone
was
deciding
what
fights
he
was
going
to
go
to,
once
he
found
the
price
of
the
ticket
to
a
championship
bout
was
too
high,
he
might
be
willing
to
settle
for
a
non-championship
bout.
and
yet,
this
court
upheld
in
international
boxing
the
findings
that
the
championship
professional
boxing
was
a
separate
segment
of
the
market
because
of
the
various
factors
which
indicated
that
it
was
viewed
in
the
commercial
world
as
having
sufficiently
distinct
characteristics.
it
had
--
it
was
different
enough
to
the
customer
that
it
was
not
--
it
would
not
--
let's
put
it
this
way.
that
in
order
fairly
to
evaluate
the
market
power
which
these
people
had.
it
was
appropriate
to
just
look
to
this
product
and
know
there
wasn't
sufficient
interchangeability
that
you
had
to
include
the
other
products.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
mean
all
these
--
all
the
protective
services?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
would,
mr.
justice.
there
is
in
this
record
a
study
which
the
defendants
introduced
covering
the
broad
range
of
the
market
and
we
have
some
quarrel
with
it,
but
their
study
shows
that
they
would
have
36%
of
the
national
market
for
all
protective
services.
so
i
think
we
have
to
put
our
case
here
on
the
market
being
accredited
central
station.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
one
other
aspect
of
the
relevant
market
which
is
the
claim
that
--
we've
been
talking
about
the
argument
thus
far
that
we
have
drawn
the
market
too
narrowly.
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
our
opponents
claim,
we've
drawn
the
market
too
broadly.
they
say
we
have
no
business
including
such
disparate
services
as
burglary
alarm
and
fire
alarm
in
the
same
market.
now
the
--
we
think
here
that
the
market,
the
business
here
is
providing
warnings
and
protection
against
hazard
through
a
central
station
of
service
--
central
station
service.
most
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
accredited
central
station,
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
when
i
say
central
station
service,
if
i
inadvertently
leave
out
the
word
accredited,
i
hope
the
court
will
realize
that
i
mean
accredited
whenever
i
neglect
to
do
so.
now
generally
speaking,
generally
speaking,
most
central
stations
do
provide
or
offer
to
provide
this
wide
variety
of
services.
there
are
two
of
course
that
don't.
holmes
provides
only
burglary
alarm
service,
afa
provides
only
fire
alarm
service.
the
reason
they
limit
themselves
is
because
under
these
old
agreements,
that's
exactly
what
they
agreed
to
do.
they
agreed
to
stay
in
their
particular
type
of
market.
the
services
are
frequently
provided
together.
customers
frequently
want
a
full
scope
of
protection.
and
we
think
that
in
these
circumstances,
it
was
proper
to
include
the
whole
market.
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
which
was
of
course
a
case
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
the
court
pleaded
commercial
banking
as
the
relevant
market.
well,
just
as
the
people
could
--
they
argued
here
that
someone
who
wants
burglar
alarm
service
isn't
satisfied
with
fire
alarm
service
so
somebody
who
wishes
to
negotiate
a
commercial
loan
with
a
bank
isn't
satisfied
by
being
told
that
the
bank
will
be
glad
to
handle
his
trust
business.
now
if
you
look
at
the
whole
business,
you
see
the
way
the
business
is
conducted.
and
here,
basically,
the
business
has
conducted
except
for
these
two
companies
which
were
restricted
on
boarder
line.
now
in
the
time
remaining
this
afternoon,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
geographic
market.
that
is
whether
the
district
court
as
we
think
properly
treated
the
geographic
market
as
national
in
scope.
we
start
with
the
fact
that
holmes
has
73%
of
the
business.
it
has
most
of
the
business
in
this
area.
and
--
i'm
sorry,
adt
has
73%
of
the
business.
i
misspoke
myself.
and
adt,
we
think,
plainly
does
operate
its
business
on
a
national
basis.
it's
true
as
they
say
that
these
limitations
of
a
central
station
are
such
that
it
cannot
operate
within
a
radius
of
more
than
25
miles.
and
we
know
that
the
obvious
point
that
if
i'm
in
washington
and
i'm
not
satisfied
with
the
service,
i
can't
call
a
firm
in
new
york
and
ask
me
to
supply
them.
on
the
other
hand,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
problem
of
whether
these
people
have
the
power
--
have
the
power
over
the
market
to
control
prices
and
exclude
competition.
and
it's
adt
which
has
the
lion
share
of
the
market
that
does
operate
on
this
basis.
it
fixes
its
rates
on
a
system
wide
basis.
it
fixes
its
rate
as
i've
indicated
in
order
to
try
to
obtain
a
certain
rate
of
return
on
its
overall
operations.
and
even
in
those
areas
where
it
has
competition
from
other
accredited
central
stations,
it
does
not
attempt
to
set
a
lower
rate
for
that
particular
city
or
area.
all
that
it
does
is
it
deals
with
individual
competitive
situations.
individual
competitive
situations
will
reduce
the
price
in
order
to
meet
the
particular
problem.
and
another
illustration
of
the
way
in
which
they
operate
in
a
national
budget
is
the
one
so-called
national
accounts.these
might
be
chain
stores,
department
stores
with
whom
adt
does
business.
these
national
accounts
like
to
arrange
for
their
protection
services
through
their
home
office.
only
adt,
which
operates
throughout
the
country
in
115
different
cities,
is
able
to
provide
this
service.
only
adt
can
come
in
and
say,
“yes,
we
will
handle
your
service
throughout
the
country.”
and
there
are
a
large
number
of
firms,
in
particular,
localities
that
testified
that
they
were
unable
to
get
the
business
of
these
large
national
concerns
in
their
locality
because
they
were
told,
this
is
all
handled
through
the
home
office
and
adt
has
it.
other
respects
in
which
adt
operates
on
a
nationwide
basis
include
the
distribution
to
its
central
stations
of
equipment
which
it
either
manufactures
or
purchases,
it
conducts
research
of
the
system
as
a
whole,
and
there
is
of
course
a
constant
stream
of
communications
back
and
forth,
personnel
from
the
home
office
going
out
to
the
various
areas,
and
so
on.
the
short
of
it
is
that
adt
which
has
three-quarters
of
the
business,
operates
throughout
the
country,
and
it
runs
its
business
on
a
national
basis.
and
as
i've
previously
indicated
a
major
reason,
adt
was
able
to
operate
nationwide
and
grow
on
the
scale
was
because
it
was
freed
from
the
competition
of
the
two
other
defendants.
and
we
think
that
in
determining
whether
the
defendants
have
monopolized
this
business,
it
is
appropriate
to
make
this
inquiry
and
to
apply
the
standards
to
the
way
in
which
the
leading
company
that
has
most
of
the
business
operates,
because
this
seems
to
us
is
a
fair
test
of
the
way
in
which
they
operate.
and
as
i
shall
come
to
you
tomorrow,
we
do
have
the
--
all
of
these
things
shown
that
adt
is
able
to
bring
to
bear
its
economic
power
in
a
way
that
none
of
the
other
firms
can.
and
it
is
operating
on
a
national
basis
and
we
therefore
believe
that
that
is
the
appropriate
way
in
which
its
power
should
be
tested.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
rose
at
the
recess
yesterday,
i
had
completed
my
discussion
of
the
relevant
market.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
showing
that
the
district
court
correctly
held
defendants
have
monopolized
that
market.
the
offense
of
monopolization
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
involves
two
elements.
the
first
is
the
existence
of
the
monopoly
power
and
the
second
is
the
conscience
or
willful
acquisition
or
maintenance
of
that
power.
and
we
think
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
defendants
possessed
both
of
those
elements.
the
monopoly
power
has
been
described
as
the
power
to
fix
prices
or
to
exclude
competition.
now
when
--
in
this
case,
when
grinnell
acquired
an
87%
interest
in
these
companies
by
acquiring
--
controlling
interest
of
them
over
four-year
period,
it
put
together
a
combination,
in
one
hand,
of
the
overwhelming
share
of
the
market.
and
this
kind
of
a
share
of
the
market
under
the
control
of
one
person
is
ordinarily
enough,
we
think,
to
show
the
existence
of
monopoly
power.
i'd
like
to
refer
this
court
to
a
passage
of
the
opinion
of
judge
learned
hand
in
the
alcoa
case
which
this
court‘s
specifically
approved
in
the
subsequent
american
tobacco
decision.
there,
judge
hand
stated,
“we
may
start
therefore
with
the
premise
that
to
have
combined
90%
of
the
producers
of
ingot
would
have
been
to
“monopolize”
the
ingot
market
and
so
far
as
concerns
the
public
interest,
it
can
make
no
difference
whether
an
existing
competition
is
put
an
end
to
or
whether
prospective
competition
is
prevented.”
now
in
the
cellophane
case,
this
court
assumed
that
if
cellophane
were
the
relevant
market
that
du
pont's
control
of
75%
of
that
market
would
be
enough
to
give
du
pont
monopoly
power.
in
this
case,
the
share
of
the
market
87%
is
very
close
to
the
90%
that
alcoa
had.
and
in
addition
here
to
the
just
the
percentages
themselves,
we
have
other
--
in
the
issue
of
monopoly
power,
the
existence
of
substantial
price
discriminations,
and
the
further
fact
that
within
this
market,
after
the
three
companies
which
grinnell
acquired,
there's
no
one
else
that
has
anywhere
near
this
share.
the
two
largest
companies
after
that
have
roughly
1.5%
and
then
it
goes
down
very
rapidly.
now,
the
combination
that
grinnell
put
together
in
this
case
not
only
acquired
this
large
share
of
the
market
but
it
further
prevented
the
resumption
of
competition
among
the
defendant
alarm
companies
that
was
a
--
to
be
anticipated
when
these
old
restrictive
agreements
were
about
to
expire.
shortly
before
the
agreements
were
due
to
expire
in
the
late
1940s,
grinnell
and
adt
had
a
series
of
discussions
as
to
what
the
future
relationships
of
the
company
should
be.
under
the
old
agreement,
grinnell
was
supplying
these
devices
in
return
for
25%
share
of
the
revenues
generated
by
the
services
for
which
the
devices
were
provided.
and
grinnell
indicated
it
would
like
to
continue
this
arrangement.
but
adt's
counsel
advised
that
in
its
view,
this
arrangement
by
which
grinnell
had
supplied
the
devices
was
an
illegal
exclusive
dealing
agreement
that
violated
the
sherman
act.
and
during
the
course
of
these
discussions
between
grinnell
and
adt,
mr.
fleming,
the
president
of
grinnell
stated
as
follows,
and
this
is
at
page
1433
of
the
record.
mr.
fleming
stated
that
grinnell
--
that
he
did
not
feel
that
grinnell
would
be
prepared
to
go
completely
out
of
the
supervisory
business
in
1954
even
if
no
agreement
were
reached
for
the
adt
company.
as
we
very
definitely
had
in
mind
in
such
contingency,
and
we're
preparing
now
to
go
into
the
central
station
business
generally,
including
both
supervisory,
burglary
etcetera
service,
if
this
became
necessary,
although,
we
would
still
much
prefer
to
renew
our
arrangements
with
the
adt
on
a
fair
basis.
now
at
the
trial,
mr.
fleming
testified
that
there
were
more
than
--
there's
more
than
one
reason
why
they
acquired
holmes.
he
stated
as
holmes'
counsel
has
advised
the
court
that
it
was
acquired
as
an
investment.
he
also
stated
that
they
had
another
reason
for
acquiring
holmes
and
this
is
at
676
of
the
record
which
was
--
so
that
we
would
know
something
about
or
have
someone
in
the
organization
who
knew
something
about
the
burglar
alarm
business,
so
we
could
compete
with
adt.
and
he
also
testified
at
record
688
that
after
grinnell
had
acquired
both
afa
and
holmes,
and
before
it
acquired
adt,
the
company
considered
whether
we
would
merge
holmes
and
afa,
whether
we
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
compete
with
adt.
so
this
record
we
think
shows
that
prior
to
the
time
that
grinnell
had
acquired
adt,
it
was
seriously
considering
going
in
to
the
central
station
business.
now,
the
effect
of
its
acquiring
adt
was
to
eliminate
any
possibility
of
this
competition
because
it
had
now
combined
in
one
source
these
different
companies
which
were
potential
competitors.
and
thus
in
effect,
the
result
of
this
acquisition
and
combination
was
to
continue
the
very
restrictive
agreements
that
had
been
going
on
for
almost
half
a
century.
and
in
the
passage
from
alcoa
that
i
just
referred
to,
judge
hand
pointed
out
that
the
combination
is
bad
if
it
restricts
not
only
actual
existing
competitions,
but
also
potential
competition.
now,
the
second
element
of
illegal
monopolization,
the
conscious
or
willful
acquisition
and
maintenance
of
that
power
is
also
we
think
clearly
shown
by
this
record.
i
have
referred
at
some
length
yesterday
to
the
various
restrictive
and
exclusionary
practices
which
adt
engaged
in.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
these
practices
clearly
show
that
in
this
case,
adt
did
not
have
the
monopoly
power
thrust
upon
it,
and
that
grinnell,
certainly,
when
it
acquired
these
companies
and
combined
them,
it
didn't
have
the
power
thrust
upon
it.
it
went
out
and
acquired
these
companies
and
they
have
this
combination.
now,
it's
true
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
a
--
that
grinnell
in
any
way
actively
interfered
in
the
management
of
the
subsidiaries,
but
it
had
a
clear
control
over
these
companies.
it
had
anywhere
from
80
to
a
100%.
it
nominated
the
boards
of
directors,
it
controlled
the
boards
of
directors.
mr.
fleming,
the
president
of
grinnell
was
also
the
president
of
adt
and
we
think
that
is
clearly
enough
to
prevent
--
that
grinnell
is
responsible
for
the
continuation
of
this
monopolization.
and
to
sum
it
up,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
statement
at
page
782
of
the
record.
this
is
one
--
a
passage
from
the
opinion
--
i'm
sorry,
762
of
the
record
from
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
in
which
the
district
court
said
that
describing
the
share
of
the
market
of
these
companies,
that
this
share
of
the
market
rests
not
on
the
scale,
efficiency,
and
fairness
side
of
defendants,
not
even
on
their
neutrally
normal
business
matters,
but
on
violations
of
per
se
rules
governing
restraints
of
trade
and
on
acquisitions
indicating
that
growth
was
a
response
to
external
grasp,
not
to
internal
grip.
so
that
we
think
that
on
this
record
and
on
this
holding
by
the
district
court,
the
district
--
that
the
conclusion
is
that
grinnell
and
the
defendants
acquired
and
held
this
share
of
the
market
as
the
result
of
practices
which
make
the
possession
of
this
power
illegal.
and
we
therefore
find
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
district
court's
suggestion
and
the
statements
that
illegal
monopolization
maybe
presumed
merely
from
showing
an
overwhelming
percentage
of
the
market
without
regard
to
any
other
factors.
this
is
--
the
court
said
this
is
a
couple
of
questions,
but
we
think
this
record
and
this
indication
by
the
court
to
which
i
have
referred,
shows
that
without
reaching
that,
this
judgment
maybe
--
the
finding
of
violation,
maybe
sustained.
so
that
as
we
see
the
case
on
this
aspect
of
it,
this
we
think
comes
within
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
recognized
that
this
percentage
of
the
market
obtained
and
held
under
these
circumstances
is
enough
to
show
illegal
monopolization.
now
--
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
next
point
in
the
case
which
is
the
question
of
the
relief.
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
this
is
the
subject
of
the
government's
appeal
in
number
73.
we
contend
that
the
relief
is
inadequate
in
significant
respects,
contrary-wise
the
defendants
claimed
the
relief
is
excessive
in
some
respect.
i'd
like
to
give
a
little
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do,
we
do.
that's
right
mr.
justice,
with
respect
to
two
items
of
the
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we're
not
defending
the
ban
on
the
employment
of
mr.
fleming
and
we
agree
that
the
general
injunction
in
terms
of
the
statute
should
be
sent
back
for
modification
in
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suppose
so,
yes.
i
might
say
mr.
justice
that
neither
of
these
two
provisions
which
the
judge
included
where
requested
by
the
government
below,
the
judge
quoted
this
on
his
own.
now,
i'd
like
to
give
a
little
of
the
background
as
the
circumstances
under
which
the
relief
was
given
in
this
case
because
we
think
this
is
significant.
in
the
pretrial
proceeding
which
i
will
discuss
in
more
detail
when
i
come
to
the
discussion
of
a
fair
trial
point,
the
judge
suggested
that
each
side
should
submit
a
draft
that
what
relief
it
believed
would
be
appropriate
in
the
event
that
the
government
would
have
prevail.
and
the
government
submitted
a
proposed
brief
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
also
a
proposed
draft
of
an
opinion.
and
the
defendants
then
submitted
their
suggestions.
now,
these
suggestions
although
phrased
in
the
form
of
a
consent
judgment
which
seems
to
us
are
clearly
not
a
consent
judgment,
the
defendant's
document,
their
brief
on
relief
at
page
162
begins
as
follows:
pursuant
to
this
court's
order
of
december
18th,
1963,
this
brief
presents
grinnell's
views
on
the
relief
which
would
be
appropriate
if
plaintiff
were
to
prevail
on
the
question
of
liability.
this
--
this
isn't
these
were
not
just
discussions
between
the
parties
as
to
the
basis
on
which
the
case
should
be
settled.
these
were
formal
suggestions
filed
in
the
court
in
response
to
the
court's
requests
which
in
turn
was
in
response
to
the
suggestion
of
the
defendants.
now
in
these
statements
that
defendants
brought
in
response
to
the
government's
proposal,
they
in
substance
agreed
to
several
of
the
government's
proposals
which
are
the
subject
of
the
government's
appeal.
they
differed
as
to
the
extent
of
these
provisions
in
the
form
that
they
basically
accepted
our
theory,
and
in
addition
two
of
the
items
in
which
we're
appealing,
they
accepted
the
identical
language
used
by
the
government.
the
district
court
without
discussing
any
of
these
proposals
added
a
judgment
which
has
been
indicated
by
mr.
sonnett,
generally
enjoined
them
from
violating
act
directed
to
grinnell
to
dispose
of
its
stock
in
the
three
alarm
companies
and
prohibited
any
of
these
companies
for
making
any
further
acquisitions.
now,
we
think
this
relief
is
inadequate
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
at
least
four
significant
respects.
the
first
one
which
we
think
is
the
most
serious
is
the
failure
in
any
way
to
do
anything
to
dissipate
the
market
power
of
adt.
adt
has
73%
of
the
market.
this
share
obviously
is
the
keystone
on
which
the
entire
combinations
market
power
depends.
this
is
the
foundation
of
this
power.
and
merely
to
break
up
the
combination,
merely
to
direct
grinnell
to
dispose
of
its
holdings
in
these
three
alarm
companies
without
in
any
way
doing
anything
to
deal
with
the
power
of
adt
itself,
it's
not
enough
to
restore
competition
in
this
business,
because
adt's
share
of
the
market
is
so
large
in
itself
is
monopoly
power.
it
gives
adt
the
very
kind
of
power
which
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
is
directed
against.
and
indeed
the
defendants
themselves
in
the
district
court
recognized
this
fact
because
at
page
179
of
the
record,
in
their
brief
discussing
the
government's
proposal,
they
said
in
the
third
paragraph,
“moreover,
defendants
agree
with
the
government
that
if
it
were
to
prevail,
some
further
divestiture
of
adt
would
be
appropriate
i.e.
we
agree
that
in
certain
cities
which
can
support
two
or
more
central
stations,
but
where
adt
now
provides
the
only
central
station
service,
an
effort
should
be
made
to
establish
a
healthy
competitor.”
now
of
course
we
realized
that
these
statements
are
not
binding
on
the
court
but
we
do
point
out
that
the
defendants
themselves
have
recognized
the
basic
reason
to
most
of
our
proposals.
now,
there
was
a
short
disagreement
between
the
government
and
defendants
in
the
district
court
as
to
how
extensive
this
divestiture
should
be.
we
asked
the
divestiture
in
46
cities,
the
defendants
suggested
divestiture
in
13
cities
would
be
opposed.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
tend
to
work
out
such
details
that
is
obviously
a
matter
for
the
district
court.
but
we
do
urge
this
court
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
indicate
that
something
should
be
done
to
break
up
the
power
of
adt.
now,
the
other
provisions
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
we
are
--
we
are
suggesting
mr.
justice,
yes,
that
this
court
should
direct
the
district
court
to
order
divestiture
of
adt
on
such
terms
as
the
district
court
deems
appropriate.
in
other
words,
we
are
saying
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
require
any
divestiture
of
adt
was
an
error.
we
think
that
relief
was
inadequate
to
deal
with
the
violation
shown
by
this
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
for
one
reason,
that's
the
basic
vice
--
the
basic
vice
here,
the
initial
vise
is
the
combination
in
the
hands
of
grinnell
of
all
these
three
companies.
it
seems
appropriate
to
us
the
best
combination
should
be
broken
up.
this
is
traditionally
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
the
mere
acquisition
there.
what
we
have
here
is
a
combination
of
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
--
if
all
of
it
--
if
we
started
initially
with
grinnell
only
one
company
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
that
would
not
be
a
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
i
--
we
think
now,
this
appropriate
relief
does
require
the
breaking
up
of
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
the
very
evil
here
is
the
combination,
and
the
appropriate
thing
it
seems
to
us
is
to
break
up
the
combinations
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
the
relief
here
can
go
beyond
the
violation
that
was
--
in
order
words,
the
fact
that
this
--
that
grinnell's
retention
of
one
company
would
not
itself
be
a
violation
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
grinnell
was
a
part
--
well
grinnell
was
the
force
that
kept
the
combinations
together.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
managed
in
the
sense
that
it
was
responsible
for
it,
that
the
thing
continued
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
fleming.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
no.
no.
we
don't
claim
that
he
actively
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
did
not
actively
part
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
and
i'm
sorry
perhaps
i
miss
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i
--
when
i
say
actively
participated,
i
may
have
misspoken
myself,
and
i'm
afraid,
i
did
understate
it.
he
did
not
actively
--
there's
nothing
to
show
he
actively
participated
in
the
sense
that
going
down
and
interfering
in
a
particular
management
--
in
making
a
particular
management
decision.
but
he
participated
in
the
sense
that
he
was
a
man
who
was
in
control
all
of
these
companies.
he
was
the
president
of
the
company.
he
sat
on
the
boards
of
all
these
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
no.
no.
we
don't
--
we
do
say
--
we
do
say
that
the
responsibility
of
grinnell
here
rest
on
the
fact
that
it
had
control
of
these
companies.
we
don't
--
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
for
example
that
grinnell
overruled
the
management
of
a
particular
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
generally,
that
is
so,
mr.
justice.but
where
you
have
the
situation
in
which
the
violation
is
the
combination,
the
violation
is
the
combination,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
controlling
shareholder
who's
put
the
combination
together
is
responsible
for
the
combination
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
it's
a
combination
of
factors.
it
is
that,
that
they
have
control
of
the
companies
and
that
by
exercising
this
control,
they
kept
in
existence
the
previous
restrictive
practice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
but
this
is
it
seems
to
me
is
little
different
kind
of
case
because
here
what
you
have
is
the
controlling
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
that's
a
harder
case,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
mere
--
you're
merely
participating
--
being
the
controlling
stockholder
of
two
companies
which
are
engaged
in
restraint
of
trade,
but
if
the
consequence
--
if
the
consequence
of
the
restraint
of
trade
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
so
that
these
two
companies
together
had
monopolization
--
monopoly
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
we
rest
on
both
i
think.
i
think
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
on
1
standing
alone
in
--
well,
let
me
comeback
in
that.
insofar
as
the
question
of
the
relief
against
grinnell,
insofar
as
the
--
it
seems
to
us
that
when
we're
dealing
with
the
combination
in
the
hands
of
grinnell,
we
do
have
evidence
indicating
that
prior
to
the
time
that
grinnell
acquired
these
companies,
it
looked
as
though
there
would
be
some
competition
between
them,
and
when
grinnell
acquired
these
companies,
that
eliminated
the
competition.
now,
to
that
extent
--
to
that
extent,
the
combination
in
the
hands
of
grinnell,
it
seems
to
us
was
a
--
the
illegal
restraint
under
section
1.
now,
if
that
--
in
that
aspect
of
the
case,
it
would
seem
to
me,
the
appropriate
relief
would
be
to
break
up
the
combination,
to
tell
grinnell
to
get
rid
of
all
these
companies.
now
in
addition
--
in
addition
to
eliminating
this
potential
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
i
think
there
are
two
elements
for
this,
there
are
two
elements.
it's
grinnell's
acquisition
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no,
we
don't.
we
do
not
reject
that
finding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
we
do
--
we
do
say
that
grinnell
has
participated
to
the
extent
that
it
is
controlling
these
companies,
that
it
has
continued
--
has
continued
the
very
thing
that
these
companies
were
doing
prior
to
the
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
board
of
the
subsidiary
knew
of
these
things?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
would
think
the
parent
would
be
liable
if
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
its
officers,
its
officers
were
aware
and
actively
participated
in
this
violation
by
the
subsidiary.
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
when
they
sat
on
the
board
of
directors
of
the
subsidiary,
they're
acting
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
and
at
least
the
record
--
and
at
least
two
of
them.
they
had
four
of
the
seven
directors
of
adt
and
they
had
i
think
three
or
five
of
holmes.
so
i
think
--
i
think
that
that
is
the
basis
on
which
we
say
basically
that
grinnell
is
responsible
for
what
these
subsidiaries
did.
on
two
other
minor
aspects
of
the
relief,
i'll
just
touch
in
passing,
i've
dealt
with
them
pretty
thoroughly
in
our
brief
which
is
the
government's
request
in
visitation
rights
which
this
court
has
held
in
the
gibson
case
in
this
kind
of
situation
it
is
entitled
to.
the
government
also
asked
that
the
defendants
be
required
to
sell
their
devices
on
nondiscriminatory
terms.
these
two
provisions,
the
defendants
accepted
in
their
proposed
admission
in
the
term
--
in
the
very
language
we
had
proposed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
don't
know
mr.
justice,
the
original
agreements
back
in
1960
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
those
were
based
on
patents.
the
record,
i
don't
think
shows
what
--
well,
i'm
sorry.
there
is
a
schedule
in
the
record
giving
a
long
list
of
the
current
patents.
i
just
don't
know
whether
there
are
any
patents
presently
involved
in
this
or
not.
i
can
tell
that
there
are
no
significant
patents
left
at
this
time.
and
finally,
one
other
provision
of
relief
is
a
provision
giving
the
customers
some
rights
to
terminate
these
contracts
before
the
end
of
five
years
and
to
give
them
the
right
to
purchase
them
as
they
see
fit.
again,
the
defendants
agreed
with
us
that
some
form
of
relief
along
these
lines
is
appropriate,
they
did
not
agree
with
us
in
the
details.
and
here
again,
we
think
this
is
a
matter
to
be
left
to
the
district
court
to
work
out.
and
now
in
my
remaining
time,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
question
which
mr.
sonnett
devoted
most
of
his
time
which
is
the
charge
of
biased
and
prejudiced
and
that
the
defendants
were
denied
a
fair
trial.
here
again,
i
think
a
somewhat
fuller
statement
of
the
facts
is
necessary.
about
a
month
after
the
answers
in
this
case
were
filed,
in
the
summer
of
1951,
the
parties
entered
into
an
exhaustive
deposition
procedure.
they
took
more
than
a
hundred
different
depositions
throughout
the
country
and
these
depositions
were
completed
in
september
1963.
and
after
the
depositions
were
completed,
the
court
asked
counsel
when
they
would
be
ready
to
try
the
case.
and
both
counsels
replied
that
they
would
not
be
ready
before
january
of
1964.
following
this,
there
were
some
consent
decree
negotiations
between
the
parties.
but
parties
were
unable
to
agree
upon
a
proposed
judgment
and
a
prehearing
conference
was
then
held
at
december
18th,
1963.
and
at
this
conference,
counsel
to
defendants
suggested
that
since
discovery
had
been
completed,
the
next
appropriate
step
rather
than
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
would
be
to
hold
a
prehearing
on
relief.
and
the
court,
as
i
have
then
indicated,
suggested
that
each
could
be
very
helpful
if
each
side
would
have
filed
a
brief
setting
forth
--
first,
their
views
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
that
is
the
government
would
briefly
state
what
it
believed
the
record
showed
as
to
liability
and
then
the
appropriate
form
of
relief.
now
after
suggesting
this
procedure,
the
court
pointed
out
at
page
129,
he
thought
of
course,
in
such
a
situation,
it
is
quite
true
that
the
defendants
are
running
some
risks.
this
caused
the
court
necessarily
in
talking
about
such
matters,
will
not
know
whether
the
government's
contention
in
interpreting
the
fact
is
correct,
or
the
defendants'
interpretation
of
the
facts
is
correct,
or
some
middle
cause
is
correct.
and
presumably,
if
the
judge
makes
any
suggestion,
they'll
have
to
make
it
on
the
basis
of
a
strongest
possible
showing
of
the
government.
and
--
well,
he
then
stated
two
pages
later,
131,
he
understood
what
was
being
suggested
was
that
the
defendants
were
trying
to
ascertain
what
kind
of
relief,
“i
would
be
likely
to
allow
if
the
government's
case
stood
virtually
uncontradicted.”
the
parties
filed
these
briefs
and
government
studied
its
proposals
as
to
relief,
and
also
filed
a
40
or
50-page
brief
which
is
not
in
the
printed
record
indicating
its
version
of
the
facts
and
why
it
caused
the
defendants
to
be
liable.
at
the
next
hearing,
after
a
preliminary
matter
had
been
disposed
of,
the
court
asked
if
there
was
anything
left
other
than
setting
the
case
for
trial,
and
when
defense
counsel
said,
“well,
we've
felt
we're
going
to
have
a
prehearing
on
relief,”
and
he
said,
“if
your
honor
would
indicate
the
relief
that
might
be
appropriate
in
this
case,
that
would
be
helpful,
so
as
to
come
to
a
better
understanding.”
the
court
responded
as
follows:
“i
assure
you
that
you
would
not
be
helped
by
anything
i
would
say.
you
would
better
--
do
better
to
get
together
with
the
government
than
run
risk
of
what
i
would
say
from
what
i
have
seen.”
and
then
he
went
on
and
said
--
the
judge
said,
“i
have
read
enough
to
know
that
if
i
have
to
decide
for
the
government
--
if
i
have
to
decide
for
the
government
from
what
i
have
seen,
you
will
not
be
in
a
position
at
this
stage
to
agree
to
it.”
in
other
words,
we
think
all
that
the
court
was
telling
the
defendants
here
was,
they
had
asked
them
to
indicate
what
he
thought
would
be
appropriate
relief.
he
had
seen
the
defendants'
proposals.
he
had
seen
what
the
government
has
asked
for,
asking
for
and
as
he
indicated
to
them.
if
he
had
decided
the
case
now
on
the
basis
of
what
the
government
had
said
--
stated
the
facts
were
and
assuming
those
facts,
he,
the
defendants,
would
not
be
able
to
agree
to
the
kind
of
relief
he
would
deem
appropriate
in
those
circumstances.
and
in
view
of
this
disposition,
he
decided
that
there
was
nothing
left
in
this
case
to
do
than
to
set
the
case
for
trial
which
he
did.
now,
at
the
next
hearing
to
which
reference
has
been
made
six
days
later,
june
3rd,
when
the
defendants
had
asked
the
court
to
put
off
the
hearing
two
months
and
also
to
define
with
more
particularity
the
issues
as
to
relief,
he
once
again,
it
seems
to
us,
made
the
identical
point.
he
said
at
page
281
to
282
--
that
he
said,
he
had
looked
at
these
documents
as
they
had
requested
and,
“i
have
told
you
that,
forced
by
you
to
look,
my
views
are
more
extreme
than
those
of
the
government.”
again,
all
he
was
suggesting
was
that
if
he
had
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
which
he
had
seen
during
this
pretrial
proceeding,
his
views
as
to
relief
are
more
extreme
than
the
government.
he
would
give
the
defendants
even
greater
relief
--
give
the
government
even
greater
relief
than
the
government
had
sought.
now,
it
was
after
this
statement
that
the
defendants
filed
the
motion
to
disqualify
judge
wyzanski
for
biased
and
prejudiced,
which
chief
judge
woodbury,
we
think,
correctly
objected.
neither
of
the
file
--
of
the
two
basis
of
this
motion,
the
statement
that
judge
wyzanski
made
as
to
what
his
views
were
as
to
liability
or
relief
or
the
court's
action
of
setting
the
case
on
18
days
for
trial,
constitutes
personal
bias
and
prejudice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
never
indicated.
he
never
indicated.
i
think
the
later
passage
where
he
said,
“over
my
objections,”
but
we
don't
know.
he
apparently,
at
least
at
the
time
he
proposed
this,
found
it
suitable.
i
think
he,
perhaps,
is
under
misapprehension
as
to
what
had
happened
personally.
i'm
sorry,
as
to
what
had
happened
previously.
i
don't
think
they
forced
him
to,
but
the
point,
i
think,
he
was
making
was
that
they
were
the
ones
who
had
requested
him
to
look
at
this
material.
and
therefore,
they
should
not
now
be
complaining
that
having
looked
at
it,
he
concluded
that
there
was
no
--
he
saw
no
basis
on
which
anything
he
could
say
would
leave
the
court
--
leave
the
parties
to
settle
it.
now
under
the
statutes,
the
--
to
be
disqualified,
bias
and
prejudice
has
to
be
personal.
that
is
it
has
to
be
based
on
something
other
than
what
the
judge
learned
in
the
course
of
the
case.
now
here,
all
the
basis
of
this
claim
of
personal
bias
and
prejudice
was
the
information
that
the
judge
had
learned
by
studying
these
pretrial
briefs.
in
other
words,
it
was
information
that
came
to
the
judge
in
the
course
of
his
study
of
the
case.
and
that
is
not
enough
to
be
personal
bias
and
prejudice
under
the
statute.
in
addition,
he
didn't
indicate
we
think
very
clearly
any
prejudgment
of
the
case,
the
passage
in
which
they
saw
and
he
said,
“if
i
had
to
decide
for
the
government,”
he
made
it
very
clear
that,
if
he
were
going
to
decide
for
the
government
on
the
basis
of
the
submission
of
the
government
had
made,
he
thought
it
was
a
very
strong
case.
now,
throughout
this
case,
in
numerous
places,
the
judge
made
it
very
clear
that
he
had
not
decided
the
case,
that
he
still
maintained
an
open
mind.
immediately
after
the
--
at
the
close
of
the
testimony
at
page
697
of
the
record,
just
after
the
end
of
the
trial,
the
judge
said
as
follows,
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“i
notify
you
in
advance
and
as
firmly
and
clearly
as
possible
that
i
intend,
if
i
should
find,
and
i
underlined
the
words
“if
i
should
find”
and
underlined
it
four
times
in
favor
of
the
government,”
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
he
shall
deal
in
his
final
decision
not
only
with
the
questions
of
liability
but
also
the
questions
of
relief.
on
that
same
page
again,
he
repeated
the
thought,
“should
i
deal
with
the
problems
of
relief,
if
i
should
find
the
violation,
if
i
file
--
filed
forms
of
decree,
framed
in
the
decree.”
and
again,
at
the
post
trial
hearing
after
the
evidence
was
all
in
--
post
trial
briefs
had
been
filed,
there
was
another
hearing,
the
judge
again
made
it
very
clear
and
stated
explicitly
that
he
had
not
decided
the
case.
at
page
729
of
the
record,
after
there
had
been
some
colloquy
between
the
court
and
defense
counsel,
the
court
said,
“i
don't
want
by
any
of
my
statements
to
imply
that
i
have
decided
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
win
this
case,”
to
which
defense
counsel
respondent,
“i
appreciate
that.”
and
then
again,
two
paragraphs
down,
the
court
said,
“in
the
event
that
i
should
decide
adversely
to
the
defendants,”
and
on
the
next
page
he
repeated
this
thing,
“you
don't
need
not
worry
that
i'm
going
to
think
about
any
problem
with
relief
unless
and
until
it
becomes
necessary
to
do
so.”
now,
we
also
don't
see
any
basis
for
the
claim
of
bias
and
prejudice
in
the
fact
that
the
court
set
this
case
for
trial
on
a
rather
short
notice,
on
18
days.
in
the
circumstances,
it
was
not
unreasonable
we
think,
the
complaint
in
this
case
had
been
filed
more
than
three
years
before,
the
extensive
discovery
had
been
completed
more
than
eight
months
before,
the
government
had
served
upon
the
defendants
a
200-page
trial
brief
which
set
forth
its
theory
of
the
case.
it
also
had
filed
with
the
defendant
various
documents
identifying
particular
evidence
that
it
was
going
to
rely
on,
and
tying
in
particular
documents
to
particular
claims.
when
the
court
set
the
case
for
trial
in
may,
it
was
approximately
eight
months
after
both
sides
had
indicated
to
the
court
in
effect
that
they
would
be
ready
for
trial
sometime
after
the
preceding
january,
that's
been
the
past
september,
and
the
most
we
think
that
the
court's
action
here
in
setting
this
case
for
trial
in
18
days
indicates,
the
most
is
that
he
perhaps
was
misinformed
as
to
the
extent
of
the
defendant's
preparation,
whether
they
would
be
able
to
adequately
present
their
case.
there's
certainly
nothing
here
to
suggest
bias
and
prejudice.
now,
going
to
trial
on
this
notice,
undoubtedly
put
a
great
deal
of
pressure
on
the
defendants.
but
the
defendants
make
no
showing
or
no
claim
here
that
they
were,
in
anyway,
prejudiced
by
being
forced
to
go
to
trial
in
this
area.
they
point
in
no
evidence
that
they
were
unable
to
present
because
of
the
lack
of
preparation.
and
on
the
contrary,
they
presented
an
exhaustive
case
in
this
thing.it
occupies
almost
one-half
of
the
printed
record.
they've
called
31
witnesses
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
our
case
only
took
an
hour
mr.
justice,
but
our
case
occupies
roughly
3500
pages
of
this
record,
a
great
deal
was
presented
in
an
hour.
and
let
me
just
refer
briefly
to
this
--
putting
the
case
in
an
hour.
this
is
not
the
first
time
this
technique
has
been
utilized
in
antitrust
cases.
judge
wyzanski
himself
followed
a
similar
technique
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
minnesota
mining,
some
years
before
where
a
great
many
documents
were
introduced
in
both
at
the
beginning
of
the
government's
case.
they
have
another
case,
united
states
v.
american
smelting
&
refining
company,
these
are
two
district
court
cases.
as
this
court
knows
these
antirust
cases,
our
guess
sometimes
get
out
of
control,
the
united
shoe
machinery
case,
there's
something
like
29,000
pages
of
documents
at
the
trial,
it
took
110
days.
and
in
this
case,
judge
wyzanski
stressed
to
the
parties
the
importance
of
trying
to
reduce
this
mass
material
into
some
--
to
some
manageable
proportions
and
that
is
what
was
done
here.
in
this
case,
the
government
reduced
its
case
to
307
documents,
excerpts
from
30
to
40
depositions,
and
these
were,
with
no
doubt,
we
started
in
many
more
documents.
we've
reduced
them.
the
defendants
knew
of
all
the
documents
that
we
had,
and
when
it
came
time
to
offer
this
material
in
evidence,
the
judge
just
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
pass
upon
each
individual
document
before
it
came
in.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
did
not
explicitly,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
specifically
mr.
justice
but
it's
not
a
--
an
uncommon
practice,
i
understand,
the
district
courts
to
reserved
ruling
on
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
did
not
rule
on
them
and
then
--
and
then,
in
effect
--
in
effect,
mr.
justice,
i
think
he
did
--
well,
he
did
rule
on
them,
he
admitted
them
all
in
evidence,
he
admitted
them
all
in
evidence.
and
i
take
to
whatever
extent
he
--
these
documents
are
relevant,
he
has
deemed
to
have
overruled
the
objections
and
as
i
--
and
we've
tried
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
we
have
to
as
--
we
have
to
assume
all
of
the
material
which
the
government
introduced
is
in
the
record.
now,
we
think
that
none
of
this
material
as
we've
attempted
to
study
the
case,
we
have
not
attempted
to
rely
on
any
material
that
we
think
is
objectionable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
by
implication
he
decided
when
he
wrote
his
findings
and
opinions,
in
other
words,
he
did
not
go
down
the
words
and
say,
“now
having
decided
the
case,
i
rule
as
follows:
this
government
exhibit
is
inadmissible.
this
particular
one
is
inside.”
if
i
take
what
he
did,
what
he
said,
these
are
all
in,
and
he
then
relied
on
those
that
he
deemed
pertinent.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
i
think
mr.
justice,
when
you're
dealing
with
these
big
antitrust
cases
that
--
as
the
judge
said,
it's
really
much
more
meaningful
to
pass
upon
the
relevance
and
materiality
of
all
these
documents
in
the
light
of
all
the
facts
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
there's
nothing
specifically,
no
i
fully
agree
with
that
but
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they're
all
admissible,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
admitted
all
of
them
in
evidence,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
then
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
he
was
--
he
considered
all
admitted,
right
at
the
outset.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
what
the
defendants
did
was
they
filed
lengthy
--
lengthy
documents
giving
their
--
rather
generalized
objections
to
each
document.
they
said,
this
document
is
hearsay,
this
document
is
immaterial,
this
document
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
filed
the
objections
to
the
documents
themselves
at
the
outset
right
after
we
had
introduced
them.
and
it
was
very
shortly
after
that,
that
they
filed
the
objections
to
the
deposition.
i
believe
that's
correct.
the
depositions,
i
understand,
the
objections
to
the
depositions
were
filed
before
trial
and
both
of
those
listed
objections
are
in
the
record
in
this
case.
now,
i'd
like
to
just
say
and
refer
to
one
other
thing
in
connection
with
this.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
many
statements
by
judge
wyzanski,
some
of
which
is
decided,
has
already
referred
to,
and
some
other
of
which
he
may
refer
to
in
rebuttal.
and
then
a
rather
colorful
and
unusual
statements,
judge
wyzanski
quite
obviously
has
some
very
definite
views
on
many
matters.
he
has
very
strong
beliefs
as
to
the
antitrust
laws.
he
has
also
some
strong
views
as
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
antitrust
field.
he
also
expresses
these
views
in
rather
colorful
and
unusual
terms
of
it.
i
think
what
he
does
basically
is
he
frequently
speaks
out
and
says
things
from
the
bench
that
others
judges
might
not
say,
that
they
might
just
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
mr.
justice,
that
there
is
--
my
point
is
that
the
fact
that
he
has
said
these
things
and
spoken
them,
it
does
not
indicate
that
he
was
biased
and
prejudiced,
that
he
had
prejudged
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i
think
the
thing
is
mr.
justice
that
when
he
made
these
remarks,
he
was
just
indicating
in
his
particular
way
his
views
as
to
the
irrelevancy
of
a
lot
of
the
evidence
that
defense
were
presenting.
they've
offered
a
lot
this
evidence,
he
in
effect
had
said
to
them
--
at
one
point
he
said,
“i
don't
think
it's
relevant.”
he
says,
“but,
i'd
like
to
put
it
in
the
kitchen
sink.”
he
even
said,
“perhaps,
this
court
will
disagree
with
me.
but
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
i
don't
think
this
evidence
is
relevant
and
i
tell
you
why,”
and
he
spoke
out
very
clearly.
but
i
don't
think
these
statements
whatever
they
may
indicate
--
indicated
that
he
was
biased
and
prejudiced
against
the
defendants,
that
he
was
planning,
that
he
had
prejudged
the
case,
that
he
had
decided
how
he
was
going
to
decide
it.
he
kept
repeatedly
saying
that
he
would
--
had
not
decided
the
case.
he
also
indicated
at
one
point
that
as
far
as
what
he
called
“primary
facts,”
the
basic
operative
facts
of
what
people
do
and
what
they
said
--
he
said
he
wanted,
“put
all
of
that
evidence”
and
the
evidence
that
he
thought
was
irrelevant,
it
was
what
he
called
secondary
and
third
level
evidence
of
economic
conditions
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
--
he
made
up
his
mind
but
we
think,
perhaps,
he
didn't
go
far
enough
in
some
respect
of
the
case.
but
we
do
think
that
his
opinion
does
show
that
he
had
gone
through
the
record.
he
admittedly
made
some
errors
in
some
respects.
on
the
other
hand,
most
of
his
findings
we
think
are
sound.
they
do
reflect
in
awareness
of
the
record
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
he's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
with
the
combination,
that
it
acquired
87%,
it
is.
and
i
think
this
is
what
--
what
he
believed.
and
of
course,
he
did
refer
to
some
of
the
price
discriminations.
i
--
it's
true
he
did
not,
in
turns,
speak
of
power
over
price
or
power
to
exclude
competition.
he
did
--
he
did
not
find
contrary
to
what
the
defendant
have
said
that
they
had
no
power
over
the
price
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
around
the
edges.
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
made
a
finding
--
the
finding
he
made
mr.
justice
was
the
defendant
did
not
have
unfettered
power
over
price.
and
i
take
it
all
that
he
was
saying
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
had
sufficient
power
over
price
to
give
them
monopoly
power.
there's
always
substitute
but
there's
always,
in
this
area,
rarely
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
had
found
that
they
had
this
share
of
the
market,
which
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
found
that
they
have
monopolized.
we
found
that
they
had
monopolized.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
but
i
think
what
he
found
was
that,
in
effect,
by
virtue
of
this
share
of
the
market,
they
have
monopolized
in
this
share
of
the
market
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is.
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
at
page
762
of
his
opinion
he
says,
“to
succeed
in
a
section
2
case,
plaintiff
must
prove
that
the
punitive
monopolist
or
monopolists
sought
to
--
sought
to
achieve
or
achieved
the
economic
power
even
though
unexercised,
to
control
prices
or
production
in
a
relevant
market,
or
to
exclude
competition
therefrom.
proof
may
be
direct
or
indirect.”
and
then
he
goes
on
says,
“one
indirect
method
is
to
prove
the
requisite
powers
to
show
defendants
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no,
this
is
in
his
opinion
on
liability.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
after
he
has
made
his
finding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
labeled
finding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
assume
--
i
assume
the
purpose
is
to
indicate
the
basis
on
which
he
decided
the
case.
and
i
assume
that
he's
saying
in
this
case
is,
that
in
these
circumstances,
this
overwhelming
share
of
the
market
does
give
them
the
power
to
control
prices
or
to
exclude
competition.
i
assumed
this
is
the
purpose.
in
other
words,
this
indicates
to
me
that
the
court
did
approach
this
problem,
did
apply
the
right
standard
for
determining
monopoly
power.
