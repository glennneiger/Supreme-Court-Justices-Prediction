does
grinnell
manufacture
some
of
the
equipment
that
goes
into
these
installations?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
grinnell
no
longer
--
no
longer
manufactured
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you're
really
arguing
that
--
that
someone
who
has
the
100%
of
the
grocery
business
in
chicago
say
it
couldn't
be
charge
with
monopolizing
the
retail
sale
of
food
because
it's
--
because
you
can't
substitute
beans
for
lettuce
and,
that
no
customer
will
buy
roast
beef
for
asparagus?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
sort
of
the
thrust
of
your
argument
though,
since
no
customer
will
buy
beans
for
asparagus,
you
can't
be
charged
with
monopolizing
either
beans
or
asparagus?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
making
--
if
you're
making
the
argument
over
the
definition
of
market
that
because
these
--
these
products
are
non-interchangeable,
you
cannot
include
them
on
the
market.

mr.
drye,
let's
suppose
that
a
holding
company
owns
10
companies,
100%
of
each
of
10
companies,
each
of
which
has
10%
of
the
market
as
a
recognized
commodity,
and
they
just
have
100%
of
the
market.
is
that
--
is
that
enough
to
any
kind
of
a
monopoly
under
section
2?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
--
would
you
suppose
it
would
be
a
combination
under
section
1
and
2?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
--but
it
might
--
it
might
be
the
same
if
it
was
90%
--
the
10
companies
have
90%
instead
of
100%
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
isn't
--
why
isn't
that
--
what
here
then
--
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
central
protective
service
is
a
relevant
market,
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment.
i
know
that
there's
an
argument
about
that
which
is
a
serious
one
but
let's
just
assume
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
market
--
a
relevant
market,
and
that
these
companies
in
which
grinnell
owns
a
controlling
interest,
have
90%
of
the
market.
would
that
be
--
is
that
in
the
danger
zone
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

(inaudible)

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
grinnell
be
permitted
to
retain
one
of
the
--
at
least
one
of
these
companies,
even
adt
if
it
--
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
paired
down
like
you
think
it
ought
to
be
paired
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
original
matter
--
as
the
original
matter,
you
wouldn't
say
that,
that
if
grinnell
owned
the
company
that
had
30%
of
the
market
or
40%
of
the
market,
that
it
was
violating
section
1
or
2
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
yeah,
but
i'm
just
asking
that.
what
if
all
that
was
left
was
grinnell
owning
one
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
did,
but
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
evil
was
--
if
the
evil
was
a
combination
which
was
violating,
that
you
claim,
section
1
and
2,
and
no
one
would
suggest
that
grinnell
owning
--
a
company
that
owns
--
that
had
30%
of
the
market
that
was
a
combination
of
this
kind
of
trade,
wouldn't
it?
it
wouldn't
as
an
original
matter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
would
you
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
grinnell
is
the
--
is
a
major
source
of
the
growth
of
the
combination,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
contend
that
grinnell
managed
this
combination
since
it
acquired
these
companies?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
claimed
that
the
--
what's
his
name,
mr.
fleming?mr.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
claimed
that
mr.
fleming
actively
participated
in
the
operations
of
the
subsidiary?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
claim
he
actively
participated
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
a
member
of
the
board,
wasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
reject
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
this
regard
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
claim
he
wasn't
aware
of
what
was
going
on,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
nobody
suggested
then
the
shareholder
company
--
the
controlling
shareholder
in
a
corporation
is
liable
for
the
antitrust
violations
of
the
corporation
in
which
he
owns
the
controlling
interest,
just
by
reason
of
the
fact
he's
the
controlling
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
must
have
bootstrapping
yourself
along
by
calling
the
same
thing
a
combination.
now
that
you
--
under
section
1,
you
might
get
a
different
answer
under
section
2
in
that
regard.
i
think,
i
suppose
you're
claiming
monopoly
in
his
power,
that
the
controlling
stockholder
has
the
power
to
control
the
monopolizing
empire.
is
that
the
basis
you
go
on
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
if
the
--
let's
assume
that
i
own
the
controlling
interest
in
a
corporation,
i'm
not
on
the
board
of
directors,
i'm
not
an
officer
of
the
company
but
i
had
control
interest
in
the
stockholding?
that
company
goes
--
enters
into
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
with
another
company
in
which
i
have
no
interest
whatsoever.
now,
do
you
think
i
could
be
--
i
could
be
--
i
have
the
power
to
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
certainly
not
liable
for
the
price
fixing,
am
i?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
what
if
i
own
the
controlling
interest
in
both
companies
and
they
have
entered
into
a
price
fixing
arrangement?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
part
of
the
combination
you're
just
trying
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
it
is.
that's
the
case
you've
got.
that's
the
trouble.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
rest
on
section
2,
not
on
1?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
only
1,
you
just
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
primarily
you're
saying
--
part
of
this
violation
is
grinnell's
acquisition,
in
and
of
itself,
rather
than
what
it
did
after
the
acquisition?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
don't
--
you
don't
reject
the
district
court's
finding
just
to
the
extent
to
which
grinnell
through
its
president
or
whatever
the
chief
executive
officer
is
called,
in
its
membership
on
the
board,
you
don't
reject
the
findings
that
grinnell
enacted
by
virtue
of
the
actions
that
mr.
fleming
continued
to
actively
participate
in
whatever
evil
things
you
accuse,
this
combination
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
adopt
it
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
would
you
say
if
i
--
if
a
corporation
had
a
owned
--
had
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
and
the
three
of
the
parent's
officers
where
a
controlling
--
had
a
controlling
membership
on
the
board
of
the
sub,
and
the
subsidiary
engaged
in
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
with
some
other
companies.
would
the
parent
be
liable
because
its
officers
on
the
board
of
the
sub
were
participating
in
the
enterprise?
let's
assume
the
board
of
the
sub
back
--
knew
and
approved
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes,
and
approved
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
the
case
here?
i
mean,
isn't
grinnell
have
a
controlling
--
or
its
officers,
at
least
in
one
of
the
companies,
weren't
they
--
didn't
they
form
a
majority
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
--
do
you
say
that
he
must
assume
that
he
ruled
that
they
all
were
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
reserved.
he
reserved
his
ruling
on
objections,
but
he
admitted
them
with
--
with
this
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
he
made
up
his
mind
or
not,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
--
why
do
you
suppose
there
weren't
any
subsidiary
finding
on
the
power
over
price
and
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
enough
just
to
have
the
market
share?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
did
find
all
these
sort
of
framed
competitions
as
he
followed
it
around
the
edges
and
he
did
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
section
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
why
wouldn't
that
--
why
wouldn't
that
call
for
somewhat
pointed
findings
on
the
power
over
--
over
the
whole
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
did
he
find,
that
they
had
fettered
power
over
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
never
found
that
they
had
monopoly
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
said
--
i
don't
try
--
that
he
had
any
power
over
price.
where's
that
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
is
that
finding
over
--
yes,
but
you
don't
--
you're
suppose
to
have
--
you're
suppose
to
find
the
power
over
price,
then
say,
“therefore,
you've
monopolized,”
not
that
“you
monopolized,
therefore
you
have
power
over
price.”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that.
you've
said
that
before,
but
how
about
the
finding
of
the
price?
where
is
the
finding
on
monopoly
power?
i
mean,
i
thought
the
issue
of
the
monopoly
was
power
over
price
or
over
--
or
to
exclude
competitors?
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
saying
that,
“i'd
just
say
there's
a
monopoly
and
therefore
somebody
must
have
this
power.”
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
his
introductory
remark
--
remarks
explaining
his
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
i
just
--
there
isn't
any
finding
on
power
over
price,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps,
you
won't
contend
that
he
didn't
went
through
this
procedure
that
both
parties
wanted
in
into
go
through
in
terms
of
giving
some
idea
about
what
relief
--
relied
he
might
give
if
the
government's
case
were
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
he
had
some
--
he
--
if
he
was
to
do
--
if
he
were
to
do
what
you
wanted
him
to
do,
he
would
become
familiar
with
the
government's
case
or
he
would
give
you
some
idea
about
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
only
--
all
he
would
have
done
was
to
assume
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
were
true
and
then
you
give
or
whether
you
--
or
whether
you've
read
the
--
didn't
the
briefs
go
into
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
they
bore
on
relief?

the
