mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
five
appeals
by
the
government
and
four
corporate
defendants
from
a
decree
below
in
a
civil
antitrust
action
charging
violation
of
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
in
accordance
with
this
court's
order
for
consolidation
of
the
appeals
and
allowing
additional
time
for
argument,
we
have
reached
an
agreement
of
counsel
which
we
first
meet
with
your
approval
as
to
the
order
of
presentation
and
allocating
points
for
argument.
in
74
for
grinnell
corporation,
i
propose
mr.
chief
justice
to
take
30
minutes
and
save
15
for
rebuttal.
i
will
be
followed
by
mr.
flinn
for
american
district
telegraph
who
proposes
to
take
20
minutes,
by
mr.
drye
for
holmes
electric
who
will
take
12.5
minutes
by
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
for
automatic
fire
alarm
who
will
take
12.5
minutes,
and
following
mr.
friedman's
argument
for
the
government,
i
trust
that
our
schedule
works
out
well
enough
so
that
i
will
have
indeed
some
brief
rebuttal
time.
the
questions
presented
to
your
honors
are
first,
did
the
defendants
have
a
fair
trial?
secondly,
whether
the
resulting
decree
was
improper,
and
then
there
are
a
variety
of
other
questions
relating
to
substantive
aspects
of
the
case
such
as
the
proper
definition
of
a
relevant
market
and
the
specific
relief
problems,
these
being
dealt
with
fully
in
the
briefs
and
will
be
argued
by
other
counsel.
i
would
like
briefly
to
describe
the
parties
and
the
business
involved
in
the
case.
grinnell,
whom
i
represent,
is
a
widely
held
company
with
some
5,000
stockholders.
for
many
years,
it's
been
engaged
primarily
in
making
and
selling
products
used
in
the
building
construction
industry
such
as
pipe
fittings,
plumbing
and
heating
equipment
and
sprinklers.
for
some
years
before
1961,
grinnell
also
manufactured
some
types
of
so-called
actuating
devices
installed
in
some
sprinkler
systems,
these
being
know
--
known
as
waterflow
alarms
and
sprinkler
supervisory
devices.
they
said
the
purpose
of
detecting
the
movement
of
water
through
a
sprinkler
system
or
the
fact
that
the
system
is
inoperable.
there
will
be
references
in
our
argument
as
well
to
central
stations.central
stations
are
premises
located
within
25
miles
of
the
protective
premises.
the
hazards
involved
being
fire
or
burglary
and
the
central
station
receives
of
at
least
telephones
wires,
a
signal
from
a
transmitter
connected
in
the
case
of
water
protection
to
an
actuating
device,
and
in
the
case
of
burglary
protection
to
some
kind
of
burglar
alarm.
following
the
receipt
of
the
signal
at
the
central
station,
appropriate
action
is
then
taken
by
personnel
of
the
station
who
man
the
station
on
a
24-hour
a
day
basis.
these
central
stations
also
used
to
receive
a
variety
of
automatic
signals
from
devices
of
other
kinds
with
which
grinnell
never
has
had
any
connection
such
as
heat,
smoke
detection,
and
burglary
detection
devices,
none
of
which
obviously
require
a
sprinkler
system.
grinnell
itself
has
never
been
in
the
central
station
business.
it
is
not
a
service
organization
at
all.
it
sells
plumbing
and
heating
products
and
its
only
connection
with
the
central
station
business
involved
in
this
case
has
been
its
former
manufacturing
sale
of
actuating
devices
and
its
stock
interest
in
the
three
alarm
company
defendants
before
this
court.
the
alarm
company
defendants
are
automatic
fire
alarm
company
referred
to
throughout
as
afa,
which
is
in
the
central
station
fire
protection
business
in
three
cities
--
new
york,
philadelphia,
and
boston.
grinnell
acquired
a
majority
of
stock
interest
in
that
company
in
1949
and
now
owns
90%
of
its
stock.
the
second
company
involved
of
the
alarm
companies
is
holmes
electric
protective
company,
which
furnishes
central
station
burglary
and
holdup
protection
in
new
york,
philadelphia
and
pittsburgh.
grinnell
acquired
100%
of
ownership
of
holmes
from
the
new
york
telephone
company
in
1950.
the
third
alarm
company
defendant
is
american
district
telegraph,
referred
to
here
as
adt,
and
that
company
furnishes
central
station
protection
against
fire,
burglary,
and
other
hazards
in
115
cities
throughout
the
nation.
grinnell
acquired
a
majority
stock
interest
in
adt
from
western
union
in
1953
and
now
owns
80%
of
its
stock.
these
three
alarm
company
defendants
are
engaged
in
rendering
protection
services
in
a
variety
of
ways,
all
of
which
will
be
described
to
the
court
later.
for
purposes
of
my
argument,
they
are
presently
irrelevant.
i
come
to
the
brief
description
of
the
decree
below.
the
decree
below
adjudicated
all
four
defendants
to
have
violated
sections
1
and
2
with
respect
to
a
market
described
by
the
court
below
as
the
national
market
of
insurance
accredited
central
station
protection
service.
the
first
of
the
so-called
three-pronged
decree
relating
to
relief
enjoins
the
defendants
generally
from
monopolizing
or
restraining
trade.
the
government's
brief
at
pages
38
and
39
as
conceded
that
that
injunctive
provision
was
defective
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
because
it's
too
broad,
so
that
aspect
of
the
relief
has
been
conceded.
another
prong
of
the
three-pronged
decree
was
an
injunction
against
the
employment
really
providing
for
the
banishment
from
employment
of
james
douglas
fleming,
who
was
the
president
of
grinnell
and
a
director
of
the
alarm
companies.
that
provision,
forbade
his
employment
ever
again
by
any
of
the
four
companies.
the
government
here
again
has
conceded
that
the
relief
was
improper
and
should
be
deleted
from
the
decree.
the
third
prong,
which
i
would
address
myself
to
primarily
was
that
grinnell
should
be
required
to
dispose
of
all
of
its
stock
in
all
of
the
alarm
company
defendants
and
never
acquire
a
stock
in
any
such
alarm
company
again.
on
the
first
of
the
two
questions
whether
the
defendants
had
a
fair
trial,
i
should
preface
by
--
what
i
have
to
say
your
honors
by
saying
it's
a
rather
difficult
argument
to
make
but
nevertheless
it
must
be
made.
the
case
was
assigned
especially
to
the
honorable
charles
e.
wyzanski
jr.
after
judge
day
of
rhode
island
and
judge
sweeney
of
massachusetts
had
each
disqualified
themselves
successfully
--
successively
on
their
own
motion.
after
the
case
was
assigned
to
judge
wyzanski,
there
were
extensive
discovery
proceedings
and
a
number
of
conferences
with
the
court
relating
to
the
administration
of
the
case,
discovery
matters,
so
on,
during
which
the
court
consistently
urged
the
parties
to
settle
the
case.
the
parties
engaged
in
extensive
--
rather
extensive
consent
decree
negotiations.
and
one
of
the
principle
problems
were
that
although
the
complaint
demanded
divestiture
of
grinnell's
stock
interest
in
adt
only,
the
government
raised
the
stakes
and
insisted
that
grinnell
should
be
divested
of
its
interest
in
all
three
companies.
there
were
other
stumbling
blocks
to
a
consent
decree
disposition
but
that
was
the
principle
one
from
our
point
of
view.
so,
there
are
no
agreement
was
ever
reached
on
a
consent
decree.
in
the
course
of
the
pretrial
proceedings,
there
were
three
pretrial
hearings
with
judge
wyzanski,
each
of
which
is
of
critical
importance
to
the
fair
trial
question
which
your
honors
have
before
you.
the
first
was
december
18,
1963,
the
second
was
may
28,
1964,
and
the
third
was
june
3,
1964
just
on
the
eve
of
the
trial
of
this
case.
the
--
our
brief
in
appendix
a
has
a
full
transcript
of
all
of
these
pretrial
conferences.
and
i
think
that
your
honors
may
well
conclude
that
appendix
a
should
be
read
in
full.
they
say
they
deserve
reading
in
full
so
that
you
may
have
a
true
flavor
of
what
occurred
at
these
pretrial
conferences.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
pretrial
conference
of
the
december
18,
1963.
your
honor
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
is
the
first
of
the
three,
your
honor,
relevant
for
this
purpose.
your
honors
will
find
the
transcript
of
that
at
appendix
a13
--
a1-13,
i'm
sorry,
of
our
brief.
it's
in
the
record
commencing
at
page
118.
the
purpose
of
that
pretrial
conference
was
to
report
to
the
court
on
the
status
of
the
consent
decree
negotiations
and
to
arrange
a
schedule
for
the
disposition
pretrial
of
objections
which
the
defense
had
to
some
100
depositions
and
hundreds
of
proposed
exhibits,
all
discovery
having
been
completed
at
that
time.
but
at
that
meeting
of
december
18,
counsel
for
the
defendants
suggested
that
there
ought
to
be
a
further
pretrial
invoking
the
procedures
recommended
in
the
handbook
of
recommended
procedures
for
the
trial
of
protracted
cases.
the
counsel
pointed
out
that
the
procedure
as
outlined
in
the
handbook
would
have
two
objectives.
the
first,
to
define
the
issues
in
the
case,
and
the
second
to
offer
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
assist
in
arriving
at
a
settlement,
if
possible,
after
of
frank
discussion
as
the
handbook
recommends,
all
the
government's
objectives.
the
court
at
that
time
welcomed
and
i
used
the
court's
words,
welcomed
the
suggestion
as
an
invitation
to
the
court
to
participate
in
a
discussion
of
relief
without
addressing
itself
to
the
merits,
and
as
being
in
accordance
with
what
is
quite
customary
practice
and
very
helpful
in
this
situation.
thereupon,
an
order
was
made
by
judge
wyzanski
of
december
18,
1963.
it
is
in
appendix
a13
to
our
brief
at
133
of
the
record.
and
that
order
provided
expressly
among
other
things
that
there
would
be
a
further
pretrial
conference
and
i
quote,
“for
the
primary
purpose
of
discussing
the
relief
which
would
be
appropriate
if
in
the
event
plaintiff
prevails.”
from
december
through
the
following
months
until
april
of
1964,
the
parties
were
engaged
in
consent
decree
negotiations
and
working
on
consent
decree
and
relief
problems.
and
the
parties
submitted
in
accordance
with
the
court's
suggestion,
proposed
forms
of
consent
decrees
and
briefs
on
relief.
they
came
before
the
court
again
on
may
28
for
a
pretrial
conference
which
the
parties
thought
was
going
to
consent
itself
with
the
matter
of
discussion
of
settlement
in
accordance
with
the
handbook
procedures,
and
the
transcript
of
that
pretrial
conference
is
at
a15
of
our
appendix,
record
252.
despite
the
fact
that
the
prior
order
had
directed
that
the
primary
question
to
be
discussed
was
a
matter
of
relief.
after
may
28
meeting,
the
court
brushed,
decide
entirely
any
discussion
of
the
matter
of
relief.
and
the
court
said,
and
again,
i
use
the
court's
words,
“you
would
do
better
to
get
together
with
the
government
than
go
to
trial.”
judge
wyzanski
emphasized
that
he
knew
that
the
trial
was
not
going
to
take
very
long.
and
he
thereupon
peremptorily
set
the
trial
date
to
june
15,
some
18
days
after
the
date
of
this
pretrial
conference.
and
he
stated,
and
i
quote
from
record
257,
“there
would
be
no
delays,
postponements,
or
further
method
of
avoiding
the
impact
of
this
court.”
the
parties
were
there
abruptly
confronted
with
the
task
of
getting
ready
for
trial
in
several
weeks,
not
knowing
which
of
the
voluminous
depositions
and
documents,
which
the
government
relied
on,
would
be
used
as
admissible
evidence
in
the
case.
and
a
motion
therefore
was
presented
to
judge
wyzanski
for
a
reasonable
adjournment
of
two
months
in
the
trial
date,
and
for
a
definition
of
the
relief
issues.
that
is
to
say
whether
the
relief
we
were
confronted
with
was
the
relief
as
prayed
for
in
the
complaint
for
the
wholesale
divestiture
and
other
relief
which
the
government
sought
in
the
proposed
form
of
decree,
its
proposed
form
of
a
decree.
and
the
court
denied
that
motion
in
all
respects
and
rather
than
characterized
the
court's
frame
of
mind,
i
think
i
can
do
justice
to
the
problem
only
by
reading
his
words.
the
court
said
and
i'm
reading
from
the
record
at
281,
a31
of
our
appendix,
“the
court
-
i
can't
understand
frankly
why
you
don't
realize
that
you
have
forced
me
to
look
at
the
documents
in
this
case,
which
i
dislike
doing
in
advance
of
trial.
you
have
invited
me,
therefore,
into
what
i
regard
as,
from
your
point
of
view,
a
rather
undesirable
situation.
i
think
i
made
that
clear
at
the
beginning.
i
have
told
you
that,
forced
by
you
to
look,
my
views
are
more
extreme
than
those
of
the
government;
and
i
have
also
made
you
realize
that
if
i
am
required
to
make
findings
and
reach
conclusions
i
am
opening
up
third-party
suits
that
will
make,
in
view
of
the
size
of
the
industry,
the
percentage
of
people
involved
higher
than
in
the
electrical
cases,
is
that
clear?”
with
that
state
of
mind
indicated
by
the
court,
the
defendants
concluded
and
i
think
reasonably
that
there
were
grounds
upon
which
to
petition
to
disqualify
the
court
and
petitions
were
filed
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
144,
the
text
of
which
your
honors
will
find
at
page
56
on
our
brief.
on
the
ground
that
the
trial
court
had
a
personal
bias
or
prejudice
with
respect
to
the
case
and
in
effect
had
prejudged
it.
judge
wyzanski
referred
the
petitions
to
judge
woodbury
who
had
especially
assigned
him
to
the
case.
and
at
that
point,
i
entered
the
trial
aspects
of
the
case
myself
and
presented
the
petition
to
judge
woodbury.
judge
woodbury
decided
after
hearing
counsel
that
the
petitions
to
disqualify
were
not
sufficient
under
the
statute
to
warrant
his
disqualification
at
that
time,
whereupon
shortly
thereafter,
the
trial
commenced.
now,
at
the
trial
which
i
had
the
pleasure
of
observing
at
least
the
first
day
of
it,
the
government's
case
which
consisted
of
some
2,500
pages
of
depositions
and
another
2,500
pages
of
documents
was
received
in
bulk
at
the
court's
suggestion
without
ruling
on
any
of
the
objections
to
any
of
the
evidence.
and
the
government's
entire
case,
in
this
situation
was
concluded
in
less
than
one
hour.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
justice
fortas,
objections
had
been
submitted
in
writing
and
both
the
government
and
the
defense
anticipated
that
they'd
be
ruled
on
in
accordance
with
the
big
case,
the
procedures
prior
to
the
trial.
the
court
declined
to
do
that.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no.
what
the
court
did
was,
as
the
court
assured
everybody
that
the
court
would
take
into
consideration
whatever
evidence
the
court
later
concluded
was
admissible
evidence,
and
would
note
in
his
findings
and
conclusions
whatever
he
thought
is
necessary,
what
evidence
he
was
relying
on.
but
the
defendants
tried
the
case
in
the
dark
without
knowing
what
the
evidence
was
that
was
submitted.
and
the
decree,
findings,
and
opinion
of
the
court
below
referred
to
some
evidence,
we
still
don't
know
what
the
admissible
evidence
was.
the
government
says
in
their
brief
to
your
honors
that
they've
relied
only
on
admissible
evidence,
and
at
--
in
any
event
there's
a
problem
about
it,
this
court
can
review
the
record
and
decide
what's
admissible.
a
burden
i
doubt
this
court
is
willing
to
assume
nor
should
it'd
be
asked
to
assume.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes
your
honor.
the
entire
trial
transcript,
the
defendants
took
about
five
days
trying
this
case
in
the
dark.
and
the
entire
transcript,
i
think
of
that
trial,
which
is
contained
in
our
appendix,
is
something
your
honors
will
wish
to
read
lest
anyone
think
that
any
of
the
remarks
of
judge
wyzanski
were
taken
out
of
context
or
distorted.
but
i
come
now
to
this
single
most
disturbing
incident,
i
believe,
in
the
entire
trial
aside
from
the
punitive
decree.
and
again,
rather
than
trying
to
characterize
or
evaluate
in
any
sense,
i
would
much
rather
read
judge
wyzanski's
words
to
you.
there's
one
page
of
critical
importance.
i
read
from
c14
of
our
appendix,
this
is
at
the
record
335.
it
is
only
one
full
page
of
the
transcript.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
appendix
c14,
mr.
justice
clark,
of
our
brief,
commencing
down
about
seven
lines.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
this
occurred
at
the
first
day
of
trial
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
while
the
government's
case
was
being
put
in.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
trial
commenced
very
promptly
after
judge
woodbury
found
the
petition
not
sufficient
under
disqualification
statute
at
that
time.
the
court
-
“i
do
regard
your
statements
as
both
an
offense
and
a
reflection
at
an
earlier
stage
because
they
are
based
upon
the
assumption
that
i
gained
information
from
some
other
source
or
other
circumstances
than
by
your
demand
that
i
shall
read
these
documents.”
mr.
fritz
-
“may
i
--.”
the
court
-
“you,
yourselves
put
on
me
the
burden
of
forming
an
opinion
and
i
did
form
one.”
mr.
fritz
-
“may
i
respectfully
say
i
had
no
such
intention
in
any
comment
i
made
to
this
court.”
the
court
-
“you
have
sometimes
given
the
court
the
impression
but
i
acquired
some
idea
of
this
case
except
from
you,
an
opposing
counsel.
i
have
no
other
idea.”
mr.
fritz
-
“i
have
purposely
never
intended
to
convey
the
slightest
information
of
that
your
honor,
nor
has
it
been
in
my
mind
at
anytime,
and
if
i
did
so,
it
was
certainly
inadvertence
which
i
regret
very
much.”
the
court
-
“you
have
made
it
quite
claim
to
the
country
at
large
or
at
least
to
this
community,
that
you
regarded
me
as
having
formed
an
opinion
from
someway
other
than
a
judge
ought
to
form
an
opinion.”
and
there
was
a
comment
by
mr.
fritz.
and
then
the
court
said,
the
court
-
“they
did
not
tell
the
whole
story
referring
to
the
pretrial
hearings
which
i
have
described.
they
did
not
tell
the
whole
story
because
over
my
strong
reluctance,
you
insisted
that
i
should
hold
the
case
in
suspense
so
that
you
could
confer
about
a
possible
settlement
and
that
i
could
look
at
the
papers
with
respect
to
the
matter.
you
and
i
created
the
difficulty.
any
judge
would
properly
resent
being
drawn
into
a
situation
as
a
trap
and
then
have
the
door
let
loose.”
now
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
government's
brief
at
pages
107
and
108
and
at
113,
you
will
find
that
the
government
conceives
that
judge
wyzanski
was
factually
wrong
in
material
portions
of
those
statements.
he
wasn't
--
he
had
not
been
reluctant
at
the
time
when
the
pretrial
procedures
suggested
by
the
handbook,
had
been
recommended
in
december,
and
he
adopted
that
he
had
wasn't
reluctant
at
all.
he
welcomed
it
and
said
so.
but
now
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
after
the
unsuccessful
effort
to
disqualify
him,
he
said
that
he
had
been
reluctant
and
we
forced
him
to
look
at
the
doctrines,
and
we
forced
him
to
make
an
opinion,
an
opinion
i
might
have
on
the
merits,
thus
becomes
clear.
there's
some
further
colloquy
by
--
statement
by
mr.
fritz
and
then
the
court
said,
“you
proceeded
to
disqualify
two
judges
and
sought
to
disqualify
the
third
on
the
eve
of
the
trial
that
had
been
postponed
for
nine
months.
your
honors
we'll
find
in
the
government
brief,
page
113,
a
concession
that
that
statement
was
not
correct.
the
fact
is,
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
disqualification
of
the
two
prior
judges.
and
the
fact
is
that
contrary
to
what
judge
wyzanski
said
there,
this
trial
had
not
been
postponed
for
nine
months.
for
some
reason,
judge
wyzanski
apparently
concluded
that
there
was
some
kind
of
‘a
plot
afoot'
to
disqualify
him
by
some
kind
of
abuse,
i
suppose,
of
the
procedures
which
we
invoke
in
good
faith
in
following
the
handbook
dealing
with
big
cases.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well
judge
day
had
disqualified
himself
of
rhode
island
sua
sponte,
the
day
i
think
the
case
was
assigned
to
him.
this
was
a
rhode
island
case.
the
case
went
to
judge
sweeney.
judge
sweeney
hand
the
case
for
less
than
a
year.
and
at
that
point,
he
disqualified
himself
because
a
relative
of
his
was
working
for
a
company
that
was
doing
an
economic
survey
for
the
defendants
and
when
this
became
--
and
he
disqualified
himself.
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it..
now
if
i
may,
i
don't
think
i
can
“gild
the
lily”
i
think
judge
wyzanski's
words
speak
for
themselves.
i
think
they
speak
very
plainly
of
prejudgment
both
in
liability
and
relief.
i
come
to
the
second
point,
the
resulting
decree
was
improper.
the
banishment
of
mr.
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
we
conceded
below,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
he
--
we
probably,
with
the
occasion,
for
his
forming
a
conviction
by
reason
of
the
procedures
followed
in
connection
with
the
handbook
approach.
but
we
had
carefully,
at
that
time,
spelled
out
and
he
had
carefully
spelled
out
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
hypothetical
consideration
of
liability
and
some
tentative
indication
of
what
kind
of
relief
might
be
in
order
if
the
government
proved
all
of
its
contentions.
that's
what
we
thought
we
were
doing.
what
happened
was
he
formed
a
conviction
on
the
merits
and
on
a
relief
which
was
unalterable
and
said
that
he'd
go
far,
far
beyond
anything
the
government
had
asked
for
on
relief.
and
there's
nothing
can
be
drawn
from
his
words
except
to
indicate
that
prior
to
the
commencement
of
this
trial,
after
the
attempted
disqualification
had
failed,
by
that
time,
he
had
a
conviction
of
substantive
liability
and
a
punitive
frame
of
mind
which
denied
to
us
a
fair
trial
thereafter.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
both
mr.
justice
fortas,
both.
we
think
that
technically
he
was
disqualified
under
the
disqualification
statute
at
the
time
we
filed
that
petition
and
we
filed
it
in
good
faith.
but
if
the
consequence
of
invoking
the
statute
in
good
faith
is
to
have
the
judge
become
so
convicted,
so
determined
on
the
merits
that
he
has
opposed
mind,
and
so
punitive
as
the
decree
shows,
i
submit
that
all
in
all,
the
entire
transcript
compels
the
conclusion
that
we
did
not
have
a
fair
trial.
i
come
to
the
decree
itself,
the
government
concedes
that
the
banishment
of
mr.
fleming
was
improper.
that
banishment
by
the
way
was
particularly
shocking
because
judge
wyzanski
at
the
trial
have
directed
a
very
high
praise
to
mr.
fleming.
he'd
spend
a
lifetime
in
this
business.
he
described
him
as
a
man
of
great
strength
and
force
of
character,
and
great
intellectual
ability,
and
having
that
kind
of
quality
that's
so
really
admirable
and
then
he
turned
around
and
said
in
this
decree,
mr.
fleming
shall
be
banished
and
shall
never
work
for
any
of
these
companies
again
in
his
life.
although
he
was
not
a
defendant,
he
was
merely
a
witness,
at
least
that's
what
we
thought.
anyway,
the
government
concedes
that
that
was
erroneous.
the
same
punitive
approach
is
reflected
in
the
divestiture
provisions
of
the
decree
because
it's
quite
clear
that
we
were
in
this
case,
grinnell,
only
because
we
acquired
adt
in
1953.
i
will
not
take
the
time
of
your
honors
to
describe
the
circumstances
under
which
we
acquired
grinnell
except
to
say
this.
it
came
to
our
attention
because
a
broker
said
that
western
union's
stock
was
available.
we
didn't
precipitate
the
matter.
we
bought
the
stock
in
good
faith.
we
made
up
our
minds
after
a
justice
inquiry,
that
if
justice
objected
to
this,
we
wouldn't
close.
we
forfeit
$600,000
we've
paid
as
a
deposit.
it
was
the
department
of
justice
inquiry.
justice
said
thank
you
very
much.
grinnell's
counsel
advised
grinnell
that
it
was
a
clearance
and
they
want
to
have
it
closed
in
good
faith.
now,
thereafter,
1953
on,
the
only
thing
that
occurred,
justice
department
(inaudible)
its
material
is
--
adt
made
an
acquisition
of
a
company
in
boston
called
general
alarm.
it
was
submitted
for
a
clearance
and
a
clearance
was
given.
and
a
clearance
was
given
by
justice
in
1955
even
though
justice
knew
what
at
the
time
and
recognized
that
hat
would
eliminate
the
only
central
station
competition
in
boston.
so
if
there
was
something
wrong,
it
was
adt
or
grinnell,
the
department
sure
had
a
chance
to
say
so
in
1955
or
1953,
and
they
never
said
that
at
either
time.
i
see
that
under
our
allocation
of
time,
your
honor,
as
my
time
has
expired,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
15
minutes.
thank
you.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
17
minutes
i
have
remaining.
i
will
try
to
address
myself
to
what
i
conceived
to
be
the
heart
of
matter
certainly
as
reflected
by
the
questions
from
the
bench.
i
don't
mean
to
approach
this
in
any
spirit
of
levity
but
if
we've
known
that
the
kitchen
sink
was
an
issue
on
the
case
grinnell,
being
in
the
plumbing
business,
might
have
found
one,
but
that
was
part
of
our
difficulty
with
the
trial.
we
would
be
trying
case
in
the
dark.
in
respect
to
what
the
judge
actually
did
on
the
admission
of
evidence,
your
honors
will
find
at
page
327
of
the
record.
the
court
stated,
“i
am
satisfied
from
my
examination
of
the
documents
which
were
offered
in
bulk
at
his
suggestion.”
but
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
in
the
admissibility
on
the
conspiracy
theory.
the
court
had
to
look
at
the
documents.
that's
evident
from
the
record.
so
therefore
i
think,
that
what
we're
confronted
with
this
is
that
the
court
admitted
them
on
the
conspiracy
theory,
having
found
from
a
prima
facie
--
from
an
examination
of
the
documents
which
was
never
made.
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
with
admissibility
on
that
theory,
and
thereafter
the
court
never
ruled
on
any
of
the
specific
objections
to
any
specific
document.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
if
read,
that
this
occurred,
i
might
say,
within
a
few
minutes
after
the
trial
begun
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
these
documents
were
never
so
far
as
we
know
examined
by
the
court
in
pretrial.
what
the
court
did
examined
in
the
pretrial
were
briefs
in
connection
with
the
pretrial
procedures.
but
so
far
as
i
know
and
insofar
as
the
record
reflects,
the
court
member
saw
the
documents
before.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
think
the
record
fails
to
indicate
that
the
court
examined
the
documents
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
government
will
contend
that
the
transcript
is
an
error
by
indicating
that
the
court
did
and
the
perhaps
it
doesn't
reflect,
and
i
think
it's
conceded.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
think
he
did
that
but
he
did
more
than
we
asked
him
too
and
he
did
something
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
he
would
not
have
examined
the
government's
evidence
relating
to
substantive
liability
mr.
justice
white.
and
he
had
no
occasion
to
look
at
the
documentary
evidence
so
far
as
we
know
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
trial.
he
had
briefs
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
briefs
discussed
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court's
indication,
that
upon
examination
of
the
documentary
evidence,
it
was
prima
facie
admissible,
it's
not
borne
out
by
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
it
says
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
it's
327.
“i
am
satisfied
from
my
examination
of
the
documents
that
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
for
the
admissibility
on
the
conspiracy
theory.”
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
they
have
been
offered
by
the
government
in
bulk
pursuant
to
his
suggestion
within
the
first
five
minutes
of
the
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
not
so
far
as
we
know.
not
so
far
as
the
record
reflects.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
he
had
briefs
discussing
evidence
and
particularly
or
--
and
he
had
a
--
i
believe,
but
i
can't
assert
this
is
a
fact,
i
believe
that
he
had
a
government
brief,
a
trial
brief
in
addition
to
its
brief
on
relief
in
which
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
with
discussion
of
the
evidence
which
the
government
would
offer.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
it
had
references,
two
exhibits.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes.
but
there's
no
indication
that
the
court
examined
the
evidence
itself
either
by
way
of
deposition
or
documentary
evidence
prior
to
the
trial.
the
handbook
procedure
which
we
invoked
contemplated,
we
thought
and
we
still
think,
that
the
court
would
indicate
its
tentative
judgment
on
relief
if
the
government
proved
its
case
in
full.
we
don't
think
that
procedure
required
the
court
or
authorized
the
court
to
reach
a
judgment
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
and
we
think
the
record
here
and
i
think
counsel
may
have
inadvertently
misspoken
some,
there
are
two
things
in
this
record
prior
to
the
disqualification
petition,
two
portions,
which
i
won't
be
taking
time
to
read.
but
they
can
be
read
in
no
other
way
except
as
a
flat
indication
of
a
conclusion
on
the
merits
of
this
case
which
was
irreversible
no
matter
what
defendants
did.
i
suggest
that,
your
honors,
yesterday
that
the
entire
transcript
of
those
pretrial
proceedings
should
be
read.
i
don't
think
it
serves
any
purpose
for
government
counsel
to
read
a
portion
and
for
me
to
read
another
portion.
but
i
say
to
your
honors
that
upon
reading
the
transcript
of
may
28th
and
june
3rd,
you
will
find
i
believe
that
the
contemporaneous
spontaneous
statements
of
the
court
below
indicated
that
the
court's
mind
had
hardened
on
the
conviction
with
respect
to
the
liability
of
the
defendants.
and
that
from
that
point
on,
that
conviction
was
shakable
no
matter
what
we
did.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
but
counsel
read
to
you
only
a
portion
and
being
an
experienced
trial
judge,
at
times,
i
think
the
court
below
used
what
is
customary
for
the
judge
to
say
“if
i
should
decide.”
but
what
we
rest
on
are
portions
of
this
transcript
which
was
spontaneous,
clear,
we
think,
and
compelled
of
necessary
inference
that
he
had
reached
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
there
are
statements
mr.
justice
black
which
i
think
can
be
read
in
no
other
way
and
in
which
require
that
conclusion.
i
refer
your
honor
to
page
819
of
our
appendix.
let
me
just
read
it.
it's
a
paragraph.
“i
assure
you
that
you
would
not
be
helped
by
anything
i
would
say.
you
would
do
better
to
get
together
with
the
government
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
what
i
would
say
from
what
i
have
seen.
let
me
just
assure
you
of
that,
and
i
mean
every
word
and
you
can
underline
that
four
times.”
at
the
conference
of
june
3rd
during
the
hearing
of
our
motion
for
a
reasonable
two
months
adjournment
which
was
denied,
the
court
said
at
page
a31
of
our
appendix
and
again,
i
think
one
paragraph
or
portion
of
a
paragraph
is
all
too
eloquent
of
what
the
court's
actual
state
of
mind
was.
i'm
reading
from
a31,
it's
the
record
282,
“i
have
told
you
that,
forced
by
you
to
look,
my
views
are
more
extreme
than
those
of
the
government.
i
have
also
made
you
realize
that
if
i
am
required
to
make
findings
and
reach
conclusions,
i
am
opening
up
third-party
suits
that
will
make,
in
view
of
the
size
of
the
industry,
the
percentage
of
people
involved
higher
than
in
the
electrical
cases,
is
that
clear?”
now,
if
mr.
justice
black,
it
were
arguable,
then
certainly
we
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
our
invoking
this
old
disqualification
statute.
and
then,
we
filed
a
petition
which
reasonably
raised
the
questions
under
that
statute.
that
petition,
as
your
honor
knows,
was
denied.
but,
as
a
consequence
of
our
invoking
the
very
pretrial
procedures
recommended
in
the
handbook,
the
court
below
having
formed
and
unalterable
conviction
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
that,
the
court
statements
at
the
first
day
of
the
trial
eliminate
any
conceivable
doubt
because,
your
honors,
i
believe,
he
cannot
read
the
transcript
of
the
first
day
of
this
trial
without
reaching
the
conclusion.
i
regret
to
say,
that
the
court's
mind
was
absolutely
flows
on
the
merits
on
the
substantive
questions,
which
were
involved
in
the
case.
i
think
the
words
of
the
court
which
i
read
yesterday
appearing
particularly
at
pages
c14
to
c15
of
the
transcript
in
our
appendix,
record
336
speak
all
too
plainly
of
the
judges
view.
the
judge
basically
took
the
position
that
he
was
forced
to
form
an
opinion,
and
in
this
context
it
clearly
means
an
opinion
of
the
merits,
we
put
the
burden
on
them
and
it
was
just
too
bad
for
us.
from
that
point
on,
i
think
it's
evident
that
the
court's
mind
was
closed
on
the
merits.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
your
honors
that
this
case
can
and
perhaps
should
be
disposed
of
by
a
consideration
of
the
disqualifications
statute
in
terms
of
today's
rules
of
practice
and
practices
in
these
cases.
and
that
the
court
need
not
necessarily
reach
the
fair
trial
issue.
however,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
by
that
the
slightest,
but
we
think
we
--
our
position
as
to
the
fair
trial
is
not
well-founded.
but
this
court
have
in
the
last
60
years
of
this
statute's
existence
has
squarely
written
on
this
disqualification
statute
only
once
in
the
berger
case.
i
think
that
the
holding
of
that
case
is
applicable
here.
i
think
that
the
reasoning
of
that
case
in
the
light
of
this
old
statute
perhaps
needs
clarification
in
terms
of
the
procedural
problems
appearing
in
these
cases,
these
days
of
the
modern
rules.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
findings,
there
were
findings
here
by
the
court
which
affirmatively
support
grinnell's
position
and
i
speak
in
this
context
now
only
if
grinnell
--
it
doesn't
appear
as
i
think,
that
the
basic
questions
before
the
court
is
whether
grinnell
was
guilty
of
a
combination
to
monopolize.
your
honors
will
find
on
examining
findings
45
and
46
which
are
at
756
of
the
record
that
the
court
made
findings
with
respect
to
exclusion
of
competitors
in
price,
control
over
prices
which
insofar
as
they
go,
tend
to
support
or
grinnell's
position
that
there
where
certainly
no
monopolization
in
fact,
that
the
power
to
control
prices
or
exclude
competitors
did
not
exist,
in
fact,
and
that
from
the
market
percent
--
market
percentage
alone,
assuming
a
proper
market,
you
can
infer
it
because
there
are
findings
so
far
as
they
go
which
negate
what
inference
might
otherwise
be
drawn.
there
were
three
main
parts
of
the
court's
decree.
each
main
part
of
the
decree
was
wrong.
there
were
findings
in
715,
17,
18,
19,
and
20,
record
750
with
respect
to
vertical
integration.
vertical
integration
obviously
entered
heavily
into
the
court's
approach
to
this
matter.
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
concededly
wrong.
this
is
not
a
vertical
integration
case.
the
government
has
conceded
that
grinnell
supplied
nothing
to
the
alarm
company
defendants
for
some
years
prior
to
this
decree.
there
was
a
finding
with
respect
--
a
prop
i
should
say,
the
second
prop,
was
that
there
was
domination
of
the
management
of
the
alarm
companies.
the
government
said
to
you
today
that
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
grinnell
actively
interfered
with
the
management.
there's
more
than
that.
it's
affirmative
evidence
which
stands
uncontradicted.
that
the
president
of
grinnell
and
grinnell
did
not
overrule
the
management
of
the
alarm
companies
with
respect
to
any
matter
except
one
and
that
was
whether
they
were
going
to
have
a
central
station
in
paris.
judge
wyzanski
for
whatever
reason
turned
that
evidence
inside
out
and
concluded
just
the
opposite.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no.
i
mean
--
yeah,
that's
correct
sir.
yes.
that
the
board
of
adt
which
had
a
majority
of
the
grinnell
directors,
as
your
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no.
management,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
delaware,
i
think.
but
in
any
event,
the
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no,
sir.
the
officers
have
the
responsibility
to
manage
the
corporation,
the
directors
elect
the
officers,
and
the
stockholders
elect
the
directors.
our
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
responsibility
of
the
board
is
to
elect
the
officers
of
the
corporation.
it
has
no
managerial
responsibility.
our
position
here
is
that
this
was
an
investment
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
this
relationship
consisted
only
of
the
election
of
the
directors
and
participating
in
board
meetings.
and
that
in
terms
of
the
operations
of
the
alarm
companies,
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
to
show
at
anytime
that
grinnell
used
its
latent
power
in
any
way
to
force
the
management
of
the
alarm
companies
to
do
anything
or
not
to
do
it
or
to
change
any
decision
may
ever
made
except
the
one
narrow
case.
that
i
think
is
the
uncontradicted
state
of
the
record
mr.
justice
white.
the
third
main
prompt
of
the
decree
were
a
series
of
findings
relating
acquisitions.
in
colorful
language,
judge
wyzanski
talked
about
the
lust
for
power
and
a
series
of
acquisitions
are
indicating
a
purpose
to
monopolize.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
after
grinnell's
acquisition
in
1953
of
the
majority
stock
of
adt,
there
were
on
--
there
was
only
one
acquisition
of
a
central
station
company
which
by
definition
is
the
relevant
market
according
to
the
government.
one
acquisition
after
1953
and
that
acquisition
was
specifically
cleared
by
a
clearance
letter
from
the
department
of
justice.
so,
i
say
to
your
honor
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
he
was
president
of
grinnell.
he
was
chairman
of
the
board
of
these
other
companies
but
not
an
executive
officer.
the
alarm
companies
each
have
there
own
presidents
who
actually
run
the
company.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
his
duty
was
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
and
a
director
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
chairman
and
his
only
duty
according
to
the
evidence
in
this
record
which
stands
uncontradicted,
his
only
duty
was
to
preside
at
the
meetings
of
the
board
and
that
incidentally
was
for
our
historical
reason,
that
going
back
to
the
earlier
days
of
ownership
by
western
union,
but
the
state
in
record
is
perfectly
clear.
thank
you,
your
honor.
