mr.
j.
francis
hayden
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
third
of
the
so-called
alarm
company
defendants
automatic
fire
alarm
company
of
delaware.
that's
a
company
which
is
not
organized
until
1920,
and
thereafter,
acquired
all
the
stock
of
automatic
fire
alarm
company,
a
new
york
corporation
which
had
been
in
business
since
1873.
its
business
was
central
station
fire
alarm,
automatic
fire
alarm.
it
operates
only
in
three
locations
--
boston,
new
york,
philadelphia,
and
it
has
no
out
of
state
customers.
it
has
no
lines
going
across
state
lines.
now,
automatic
of
new
york
came
into
the
sprinkler
business,
that
is
the
sprinkler
alarm
and
bell
alarm
business
with
these
1907
agreements,
the
so-called
fire
alarm
agreements
that
your
honors
will
be
looking
at.
i
don't
want
to
attempt
in
this
short
argument
to
discuss
much
except
to
mention
to
you
that
you'll
notice
that
the
old
automatic
fire
alarm
company
was
involved
in
those
agreements
because
there
was
some
patent
problems
with
another
outlet
called
automatic
fire
protection
company
and
these
names
may
get
confusing.
and
that
there
were
some
cross-licensing
in
those
agreements
whereby
my
client
received
a
license
to
use
this
providence
firm's
patents
in
these
three
cities
and
we
gave
them
a
right,
a
cross-license,
to
use
our
patents
anywhere
else,
and
that's
how
we
got
involved
apparently
in
the
start
of
what's
been
called
a
territorial
allocation
which
goes
back
before
i
was
born,
and
there's
hardly
anyone
around
could
tell
us
anything
about
what
was
really
going
on
then.
in
any
event,
in
1949,
grinnell
acquired
a
controlling
interest
in
automatic
of
delaware
that
apart
from
naming
a
majority
of
our
board
of
directors,
they
did
nothing
to
change
our
management.
now
judge
wyzanski
found
that
apparently
they
were
running
our
company
and
that
ever
proposal
that
came
from
grinnell
was
accepted
by
our
board,
but
even
the
government
had
to
admit
in
a
big
footnote
on
their
brief,
page
82,
that
he
was
wrong
about
that.
it
was
just
the
opposite.
they
never
overruled
any
of
our
management
proposals
or
plans.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
it's
now
90%.
but
that's
a
matter
i
want
to
press
on
the
court.
wouldn't
you
say
it's
only
90%
because
we
still
have
10%
represented
by
some
63
individual
minority
stockholders
and
that
takes
me
to
another
point
i
want
to
bring
home
and
that
is
that
when
they
came
to
acquire
the
adt
stock
which
was
a
couple
of
years
later,
they
then
had
a
minority
stockholders
there.
and
you'll
find
that
in
this
record,
it's
pretty
clear
that
grinnell
has
always
very
careful,
not
to
be
in
a
position
of
favoring
one
of
the
subsidiaries
as
against
the
other
because
there
were
two
sets
of
minority
stockholders
whose
interest
--
they
religiously
respect
it.
now
despite
that,
despite
the
unchallenged
testimony
here
that
grinnell
really
never
tried
to
run
this
business
and
tell
them
how
to
do
it,
they
weren't
in
the
business
at
all.
they
were
mainly
investors.
judge
wyzanski
seemed
to
find
that
grinnell
was
dominating
this
and
that
we
are
really
a
tool
or
a
participant
in
a
big
national
--
nationwide
combination.
well,
i'm
going
to
ask
this
court
to
take
a
good
look
at
this
evidence.
it's
going
to
take
a
long
time
for
me
to
ever
try
to
mention
some
of
the
things.
we've
enumerated
in
our
brief
many
cases
where
there
are
gaps.
the
government
has
ignored
us
in
their
brief.
they
mentioned
us
in
118
pages
about
eight
times
just
in
passing.
judge
wyzanski
--
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
no,
there
were
three
grinnell
directors
and
two
of
our
management
directors
but
they
put
no
officers
in
--
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
i
would
say
president,
general
counsel,
and
treasurer
or
people
like
that.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
if
i'm
sure
there
were
under
the
notes
but
--
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
no.
there's
no
question
that
they
had
a
majority
but
they
didn't
use
that
majority
to
hurt
anybody
in
the
corporation.
it
seems
to
me
they
were
particularly
careful
and
concerned
about
the
interest
of
the
other
stockholders.
and
then
when
they
got
into
a
conflict
between
two
subsidiaries
with
different
sets,
they
--
or
even
more
so.
now,
when
we
set
out
the
questions
that
we
think
are
involved
here,
we
put
the
first
emphasis
on
this
new
rule
of
law,
this
presumption
of
guilt
in
this
case,
because
we
felt
that
while
we
subscribed
to
the
arguments
of
our
relevant
market
in
the
arguments
made
here
about
no
fair
trial,
we
think
that
we
weren't
held
in
this
case
in
any
way
except
by
the
invocation
of
this
new
doctrine.
and
by
throwing
us
in
a
bundle
with
these
other
corporations
without
analyzing
what
we
were
actually
doing,
just
to
give
you
an
example,
you'll
find
that
judge
wyzanski
was
holding
that
the
alarm
company
defendants
uses
that
expression,
and
so
does
the
government,
served
more
than
900
subscribers
across
state
lines
and
spent
almost
$700,000
in
one
year
in
interstate
telephone
line
charges.
but
we
didn't
have
a
single
customer
outside
--
across
the
state
line.
and
yet
he's
using
this
blanket
expression
that
pulled
us
in.
now
similarly,
and
for
example,
appendix
39-41,
you'll
find
a
long
list
of
items
which
he
thought
showed
that
we
were
engaged
in
a
national
pattern
of
business.
within
that
long
list,
there
wasn't
any
single
thing
that
related
to
us,
except
one
little
thing
and
that
is
that
we
were
accredited
by
national
insurance
companies.
well
now,
if
we're
going
to
get
an
interstate
character,
a
nationwide
character
just
because
we
happen
to
deal
with
an
insurance
company
that
is
a
nationwide
insurance
company,
i
think
we'd
be
pretty
foregone.
i
don't
see
how
we
could
acquire
an
interstate
commerce
character
in
this
fashion.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
now
--
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
your
honor,
we
have
taken
the
position
within
this
case,
we
were
in
a
purely
local
business,
and
that
we
might
just
as
well
have
had
a
shoe
store
in
boston
and
a
barbershop
in
new
york,
and
some
other
fruit
stand,
let's
say
in
philadelphia.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
well,
i'm
--
i
was
directing
--
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
--
i'm
directing
it
to
both.
i've
emphasized
this
interstate
commerce
point
because
that's
a
defense
that
we
could
plea
below.
you
don't
find
all
the
defendants
raising
that
question.
i
believe
holmes
raises
that
question.
but
about
the
market
question,
i
don't
want
to
invade
on
the
problems
of
other
counsels
who
went
into
that
and
gave
you
a
very
long
brief
on
it.
i
do
want
to
point
this
out,
that
with
all
this
business
about
a
nationwide
market,
a
big
percentage
of
the
combination
that
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
about,
what
did
we
come
up
within
all
the
statistics
in
this
case?
that
there
are
2%
and
yet
judge
wyzanski
found
that
we
were
one
of
the
dominant
companies
on
the
national
scene
and
we're
being
presumed
to
be
engaged
in
conscious
monopolization.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
i
don't
agree
with
that,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
no.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
i'd
say
they
cannot.
we're
in
the
fire
alarm
business.
holmes
is
in
a
burglar
alarm
business.
the
only
odd
thing
in
this
case,
if
you've
seen
the
footnote
--
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
--
that
we
happen
to
have
one
burglar
alarm
on
what
you
might
call
burglar
alarm,
and
so
far
back,
nobody
knows
where
it
came
from.
(inaudible)
in
new
york's
stock
exchange
is
tied
up
to
(inaudible).
but
apart
from
that,
we're
not
in
the
burglar
alarm
business
--
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
--
and
why
should
we
be
tied
in?
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
j.
francis
hayden
adt
is
in
both
businesses,
and
adt
is
in
a
lot
of
places
where
we're
not.
they're
in
120
cities
or
wherever
it
is,
we're
only
in
three.
now
i'd
like
--
i
hope
i
have
a
half
a
minute.
i'd
like
to
note
one
final
thing.
judge
wyzanski
found
that
even
while
we're
in
this
bundle
as
he
took
it.
we
didn't
have
the
power
to
control
prices
when
we
have
fringed
competition.
i
think
they
began
to
get
worried
a
little
bit
about
this
flat
presumption
when
they
get
around
finding
47.
you
see
that
they
began
to
have
little
doubts
because
he's
mentioned
“cross-elasticity
of
demand
is
coming
up
because
of
some
fringe
competition.”
and
all
of
a
sudden,
he
turns
around
and
he
decides
the
whole
matter,
i
think,
and
he
puts
it
in
the
italics,
he
wanted
everybody
to
see
it.
he
turns
the
whole
case,
i
think,
in
the
middle
from
his
words
in
italics,
as
something
he
took
out
an
admission
in
the
brief
in
counsel's
argument
that
adt
had
20
deficit
officers.
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
adt's
22
deficit
officers.
in
fact,
we
were
just
sort
of
stepbrothers
because
of
the
subsequent
affiliation
through
stock
purchase.
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
officers
or
why
and
yet
that's
the
thing
he
seems
to
turning
on
and
he
uses
italics
to
point
out
that
nothing
is
more
persuasive
than
the
capacity
of
a
combination
to
sustain
offerings
of
the
laws
in
a
particular
area
and
thus
to
extend
their
monopolistic
control.
he
then
says,
“it's
not
necessary
to
go
and
to
discuss
other
things,
acquisitions,
if
any.”
i
don't
know
what
“if
any”
means.
does
it
mean
me
or
it
doesn't?
all
i
know
is
that
we
didn't
have
any
acquisitions
and
we
weren't
in
those
other
cities.
i
ask
the
court
to
look
carefully
of
what
i
claim
as
a
total
lack
of
evidence
in
this
case
and
to
find
that
the
case
should
have
been
dismissed
as
to
my
particular
client.
it
wasn't
made
out.
it
should
have
been
dismissed
and
there's
no
occasion
to
go
back
to
retry.
the
government
doesn't
ask
to
retry
it.
it
should
be
decided
on
this
record
just
as
lacking
as
it
is.
