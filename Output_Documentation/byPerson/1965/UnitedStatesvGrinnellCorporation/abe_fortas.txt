justice
abe
fortas
was
there
an
opportunity
afforded
to
defendants
to
submit
their
objections
in
subsequent
date?
justice
abe
fortas
they
could
rule
on
them
at
any
time?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
judge
woodbury
had
ruled
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
your
point
that
judge
wyzanski
improperly
had
a
prior
conviction
about
the
merits
of
this
case,
is
that
a
point
you
make
at
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
because
what
i'm
really
asking
about
--
are
you
submitting
to
us
that
the
denial
of
a
fair
trial
up
to
this
point
in
your
argument
was
due
to
the
formation
of
a
prior
conviction
on
the
part
of
a
judge
or
are
you
saying
you
were
denied
of
fair
trial
because
of
what
you
argue,
to
be
punitive
attitude
of
the
judge?
justice
abe
fortas
how
much
elasticity
is
there
with
respect
to
access
to
the
equipment
that's
necessary
for
these
services?
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
well
this
service
requires
the
installation
of
certain
equipment,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
companies
in
this
group
make
that
equipment,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
now
is
that
equipment,
is
it
a
complete
set,
an
adequate
set
of
equipment,
freely
available
to
competitors
from
other
sources?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
pretrial
conference
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
how
can
you
say
that
the
issue
here
is
just
price?
justice
abe
fortas
well
actually,
there's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
possibilities,
aren't
there,
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well
vice
versa
is
not
a
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
arguing
this
just
on
the
monopoly
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
why
are
you
arguing
this
just
on
the
monopoly
basis?
because
you
think
the
relief
here
cannot
be
justified
under
section
1?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
court
found
a
violation
of
section
1,
as
well
as
2.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
the
government
run
that
the
other
way
on
you,
so
that
you
cut
prices
or
then
they
could
cut
it
and
they're
to
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that,
i
thought
that
your
point
was
that
--
going
on
your
nationwide
resources
and
the
aggregation
of
the
--
all
of
these
companies
that,
this
demonstrated
your
power
to
exclude
competition.
it
also
demonstrated
that
you
used
it.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
--
maybe
i
misread
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
drye,
following
justice
white's
questions,
are
you
submitting
to
us
that
we
must
not
consider
grinnell
and
its
subsidiaries
in
the
aggregate
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
because
it's
always
a
good
idea.
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
argument
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
you're
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
you
--
you're
directing
your
argument
for
the
proper
definition
of
the
market
or
to
jurisdictional
point
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
you
would
fall
within
the
intrastate
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
don't
agree
then?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
your
position
is
to
whether
these
companies
can
be
aggregated
for
the
purposes
of
defining
a
market.
justice
abe
fortas
adt
is
involved,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
adt
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
both
businesses?
justice
abe
fortas
adt
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
what
you're
doing
or
about
to
do,
or
have
done
is
to
treat
these
companies
as
an
aggregate
for
certain
purposes
and
separate
for
other
purposes.
justice
abe
fortas
--
you're
running
it
both
ways,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
adt
has
what
--
what's
the
percentage?
justice
abe
fortas
and
its
80%
owned
by
grinnell.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
taxing
them
with
their
conduct
because,
in
the
fact,
of
aggregation.
and
you're
also
taxing
them
with
their
conduct
because
the
individual
constituent
companies
did
not
compete
among
themselves.
i'm
not
quarreling
with
you
at
the
moment.
i
was
just
trying
to
express
an
attitude
but
i
would
like
to
be
clear
as
to
what
you're
doing
or
the
extent
from
which
you're
using
the
aggregate
theory,
the
extent
to
which
you're
using
the
theory,
that
you're
going
to
treat
them
as
separate
individuals
or
it's
an
extent
to
which
you're
bringing
them
on
both
levels,
at
the
same
time
for
various
purposes.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
creates
a
problem
for
you
in
market
definition,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
what
you
just
said
about
the
development
of
non-central
station
operations
into
central
station
operations.
then
that
create
a
problem
for
you
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
the
relevant
market?
justice
abe
fortas
i'll
note
your
words.
justice
abe
fortas
why
isn't
that
just
competition
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
to
the
(4)
(a)
question?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
when
you
--
but
there
again,
you're
getting
on
this
problem
of
the
definition
of
the
market.
and
is
there
a
demonstration
in
the
record?
i've
gone
through
all
of
this
record
and
yet
by
any
means
--
yes,
but
is
there
a
demonstration
in
the
record
that
in
these
particular
situations,
these
companies,
and
the
aggregate,
or
individual
have
a
--
the
kind
of
dominance
that
might
make
what
otherwise
would
be
â€˜routine
competition'
unlawful?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
have
to
show,
wouldn't
you,
would
be
--
with
some
specificity,
the
use
of
dominant
market
power
to
exclude
competition
--
and
the
mere
fact
that
competition
has
improve
a
point,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
agree
but
i
would
--
but
you
have
to
show
that
they
have
the
power
in
that
particular
market
or
let's
don't
use
the
word
market.
you
have
to
show
that
they
have
that
dominant
power
as
related
to
that
particular
situation.
and
i
suppose
you
could
do
that
in
one
of
two
ways,
either
by
showing
that
they
have
nationwide
power
and
that
nationwide
power
has
brought
to
bear
on
this
particular
situation
or
the
situation
on
the
locality
where
rko
has
its
studios,
to
use
that
as
an
example,
or
you
would
have
to
show
that
in
that
specific
locality,
they
had
dominant
power?
justice
abe
fortas
but
merely,
you
are
telling
us
about
price
cutting
alone
to
meet
competition
or
to
undercut
competition
without
relevant
dominant
power,
i
suppose,
you
and
i
would
agree,
it
signifies
very
low.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
couldn't
get
into
a
monopoly
case.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
excuse
me,
if
i
interrupt
you
again.
does
the
record
show
that
there
was
any
specific
event
that
precipitated
the
commencement
of
this
action?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
think
not
unless
it's
in
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
--
you
really
think
this
is
relevant
to
the
question
of
market,
that
one
is
better
than
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
me
about
that?
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
addressing
myself
to
your
last
argument
because
that's
highly
arguable,
when
you
mean
to
say
to
the
superior
quality
of
this
service.
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
argument
that
the
qualitative
difference
is
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
market
--
in
defining
market?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
maybe
very
immaterial
to
a
customer
whether
he
gets
a
superior
quality
product
or
mediocre
or
an
inferior
and
cheaper
quality
of
product.
but,
i
should
not
think
that
it
rather
have
a
very
direct
relationship
to
the
definition
of
market
for
antitrust
purposes.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
suppose
when
somebody
considers
purchasing
fire
alarm
or
burglar
alarm
protection,
fire
and
burglar
protection
let
me
say,
and
you
would
then
consider
what
he
can
--
what
he
will
get
and
how
much
it
would
cost
him
if
he
hires
joe
to
sleep
on
the
premises
the
whole
night
and
then
gradation
of
services
all
the
way
to
the
summit
which
you
say
is
provided
by
these
services.
and
i
suppose
your
argument
of
--
your
adversaries
here
is
that
all
of
the
types
of
those
--
all
those
types
of
services
have
been
put
within
the
definition
of
the
market
for
antitrust
purposes.
justice
abe
fortas
if
one
is
interested
in
obtaining
and
utilizing
this
type
of
protection
for
purposes
of
getting
an
insurance
discount,
you
might
turn
to
this,
depending
on
balancing
the
cost.
and
on
the
other
hand,
he
might
feel
that
the
cost
of
this
service
has
been
made
worthwhile
and
more
than
over
balances
--
counterbalances
the
discounts
that
they'll
get,
and
you
might
then
take
another
type
of
service.
justice
abe
fortas
but
to
your
mind,
that
justifies
a
distinction
as
to
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
what
you
are
trying
to
get
to
this
but
on
the
basis
--
on
the
analysis
of
this
record,
would
it
make
a
determinative
difference
in
this
case
that
you
included
the
other
types
of
services
as
part
of
the
market?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
