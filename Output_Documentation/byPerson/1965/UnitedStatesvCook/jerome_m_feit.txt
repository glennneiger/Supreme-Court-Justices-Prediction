mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
request
the
court's
permission
for
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles
of
the
tennessee
bar
to
argue
this
case
for
appellee's
pro
hac
vice.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
dismissing
an
indictment
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
charge
an
offense
under
the
statute
upon
which
it
was
based,
18
u.s.c.
660.
the
indictment
which
is
set
out
at
page
1
of
the
record
charged
that
while
riding
on
his
employer's
truck
moving
in
interstate
commerce,
appellee
embezzled
funds
belonging
to
his
employer
who
was
an
individual
engaged
in
commerce
as
a
common
carrier.
18
u.s.c.
660
proscribed
such
embezzlement
when
committed
by
an
employee
of
any
firm,
association,
or
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
as
a
common
carrier.
the
district
court
read
the
statutory
language
firm,
association,
corporation
as
excluding
from
the
statute's
coverage
individually
owned
carriers
and
accordingly
dismissed
the
indictment.
in
so
doing,
it
followed
the
lead
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
in
1950,
in
a
per
curiam
decision
earlier
reached
the
same
result.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
district
court
has
given
the
statute
an
unnecessarily
circumscribed
reading
contrary
to
the
underlying
legislative
purpose
and
not
commanded
by
the
statutory
language.
as
we
will
show
the
statute
in
general
and
the
employee
provision
in
particular,
protects
all
common
carriers
engaged
in
the
business
of
interstate
carrier,
irrespective
of
their
size,
and
no
matter
the
internal
business
structure
in
which
the
carrier
chooses
to
operate.
i
would
first
like
to
turn
to
an
examination
of
this
legislative
purpose
and
then
to
the
question
of
whether
the
actual
language
employed
in
the
statute
can
reasonably
be
read
and
fairly
understood
as
convened
to
this
purpose.
18
u.s.c.
660
is
an
amalgam
of
two
distinct
provisions
of
a
criminal
code
brought
together
by
the
1948
revision.
one,
dealing
with
embezzlement
by
executives
of
carriers
which
had
been
previously
section
412
of
the
1946
code,
and
the
other
with
certain
kinds
of
employee
embezzlement
which
had
been
section
409
of
the
1946
code.
the
employee
part
under
which
appellee
was
here
indicted
was
first
adopted
in
1946,
only
two
years
before
the
1948
revision
as
one
of
the
series
of
broadening
amendments
of
the
carlin
act
of
1913
which
had
its
aim,
the
protection
of
--
from
theft
of
property
entrusted
to
carriers
for
interstate
transportation.
the
1946
amendment
to
section
409,
streamlined
statutes
by
setting
it
up
in
separate
provisions,
broadened
it
to
cover
air
as
well
as
surface
transportation
and
embezzlement
as
well
as
larceny
and
in
addition,
added
section
409
(a)
(5)
which
is
set
out
at
page
9
of
our
brief.
in
essence,
this
section
provided
that
an
employee
of
any
carrier
who
embezzles
his
employer's
funds
while
riding
either
upon
any
vehicle
belonging
to
his
employer
shall
be
guilty
of
a
penalty
--
of
a
felony.
the
language
in
the
statute,
any
carrier
clearly
covered
all
forms
of
carrier
business
regardless
of
size
or
their
internal
business
structure.
indeed,
there
is
no
question
that
appellee
agrees
that
if
409
(a)
(5)
was
the
law
today
and
the
indictment
was
specifically
drawn
under
that
section,
the
indictment
was
quite
proper
and
authorized.
the
argument
is
made,
however,
that
the
congressional
purpose
was
changed
and
that
the
scope
of
409
(a)
(5)
was
narrow
by
virtue
of
its
combination
with
what
had
been
this
executive
provision,
section
412
of
the
1946
code
which
had
proscribed
embezzlements
by
any
president,
director,
officer,
or
manager
of
any
firm,
association
or
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
as
a
common
carrier.
the
result
of
the
1948
revision,
the
creation
of
section
660,
was
that
the
language
employee
of
any
carrier
was
substituted
and
the
language
of
the
statute
became
an
employee
of
any
firm,
association
or
corporation.
all
the
trustworthy
evidence
we
submit
points
to
the
fact
that
this
was
--
this
change
of
the
revises
did
not
narrow
the
statute
but
was
basically
a
stylistic
change
not
certainly
a
change
of
substance.
first
of
all,
section
412
as
it
had
existed
in
the
criminal
code
prior
to
the
1948
revision
does
not
require
such
a
reading.
it
derives
intact
from
section
9
of
the
clayton
act.
undeniably,
this
provision
adopted
almost
35
years
before
the
1948
revision
was
principally
concerned
and
meant
to
prevent
financial
depletion
of
railroad
businesses
through
executive
embezzlement.
it
is,
however,
also
a
fair
inference
we
think
to
draw
from
both
the
language
of
the
section
9
and
from
some
of
the
senate
debate
that
the
intent
was
more
broad
--
was
broader,
that
in
addition
to
protecting
against
embezzlement
by
executives
of
railroads,
congress
aimed
at
serving
the
public
interest
in
protecting
all
interstate
carriers
from
impairment
of
effective
operation
through
embezzlement
by
executives.
as
one
of
the
managers
of
the
senate
bill
said
of
section
9,
we
are
dealing
with
all
carriers
alike.
this
view
is
supported
by
the
language,
the
comprehensive
language
used.
if
congress
have
merely
decided
to
reach
multiple
ownership
carriers,
the
words
“corporation
and
association”
would
have
been
sufficient
since
associations
would
include
partnerships.
by
also
using
the
word
firm,
congress,
we
submit
indicated
its
intent
to
cover
all
carriers
in
the
business
of
common
carriage
without
regard
to
form
of
ownership,
the
form
of
ownership.
in
addition,
it
is
significant
i
think
that
section
9
jurisdiction
was
not
based
upon
size
of
the
carrier
but
on
the
connection
of
the
embezzled
funds
to
commoners.
this
provision,
section
9,
was
thereafter
carried
over
into
the
criminal
code
in
1926,
and
every
six
to
eight
years
thereafter,
whenever
a
new
addition
of
the
code
was
published,
and
in
1948
was
combined
with
section
409
(a)
(5).
there
is
no
cogent
reason
apart
from
the
language
of
412
submitted
by
appellee
or
the
court
below
why
congress
would've
limited
the
scope
of
409
(a)
(5)
in
the
1948
revision.
appellee
urges
an
explanation
of
this
cutting
down
that
the
employees
of
individual
carriers
on
--
on
the
truck
employees
of
individual
carriers
and
their
acts
of
embezzlement
would
involve
small
amounts
and
not
be
within
the
congressional
concern.
the
sure
answer
to
that
is
that
the
employee
provision
only
applies
to
employees
who
worked
on
the
trucks
of
carriers
and
whether
the
carrier
is
a
multiple
ownership
carrier
or
individually
owned
carrier.
it
would
have
been
very
strange
indeed,
we
submit,
if
congress,
having
undertaken
to
protect
the
small
as
well
as
the
large
carriers
would
have
through
the
--
by
the
way
of
a
revision,
change
that
purpose
to
exclude
the
individually
owned
small
carrier.
we
have
made
a
random
survey
of
about
ten
percent
of
the
--
some
11,700
odd
common
carriers
with
an
annual
revenue
of
$200,000
or
less.
and
we
find
that
almost
40%
of
those
carriers
were
individually
owned,
many
operating
under
a
company
name
and
having
over
2000
employees
and
during
the
same
period
of
time,
during
1964,
only
one
percent
of
the
carriers
registered
operated
as
partnerships.
quite
appropriate
here
is
what
the
court
said
in
united
states
against
a
&
p
trucking
company
at
358
u.s.
which
held
that
a
partnership
was
an
entity
for
purposes
of
criminal
prosecution
under
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935.
the
court
said,
the
conclusion
is
not
likely
to
be
reached
that
congress
intended
that
some
carriers
should
not
be
subject
to
the
full
gamut
of
sanctions
provided
for
infractions
of
icc
regulations
merely
because
of
the
form
under
which
they
were
organized
to
do
business.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i'm
quoting
from
united
states
against
a
&
p
trucking
company,
your
honor
at
358
u.s.
this
approach
which
seems
to
us
is
even
more
applicable
here.
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
could
have
intended
that
small
carrier,
the
carrier
perhaps
more
in
need
of
protection
than
any
other
carrier.
and
would
not
be
under
the
act
and
that
the
jurisdiction
would
depend
upon
whether
an
individual
chose
to
do
business
as
a
sole
proprietorship
even
though
he
had
the
name
company
after
the
sole
proprietorship
or
as
a
one-man
corporation.
finally,
we
submit
in
this
connection
that
congress
would
hardly
have
sought
this
change
if
it
so
intended
through
the
means
of
a
revision.
the
reviser's
note
accompanying
section
660
make
plain
that
the
original
intent
of
congress
is
preserved
and
that
a
uniform
style
of
statutory
expression
is
adopted.
also,
in
the
practice
to
title
18
u.s.c.
the
reviser
state
in
general,
with
few
exceptions,
the
code
does
not
attempt
to
change
existing
law.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
employee
would
have
to
be
an
employee
of
any
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
our
basic
position
is
that
the
word
firm
connotes
a
business
entity
rather
than
a
multiple
ownership.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
409
(a)
(5)
was
an
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
right.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
firm,
association
or
corporation
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
read
firm
and
the
words
in
combination
as
in
indicating
a
congressional
intent
to
reach
the
business
of
interstate
carriage,
be
--
an
ongoing
carrier
business
rather
than
congress
having
any
concern
with
the
internal
structure
of
the
business
or
the
way
a
carrier
decides
to
operate
his
business.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
as
far
as
i
know,
i
do
not
know
of
any
such
requirement,
there
may
be
one.
i
might
add
mr.
justice
brennan
that
in
the
course
of
examining
these
registration
certificates,
they
have
a
portion
which
says,
“the
nature
of
ownership,”
and
they
would
say
sole
proprietor,
named,
doing
business
as
of
jones
transfer
company,
and
these
are
individually
owned
carriers,
but
doing
businesses
as
companies.
and
this
brings
me
precisely
to
the
major
argument
that
appellee
makes,
and
that
is
that
the
word
firm
has
some
fixed
indefinite
common
law
meaning
or
other
meaning
which
necessarily
excludes
carriers
from
coverage.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
yes
and
he
was
an
employee
of
an
individual
tolbert
hawkins
engaged
in
commerce
as
a
common
carrier.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
hakwins
has
a
--
a
registration
certificate
had
been
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
in
the
name
of
tolbert
hawkins.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
did
not
know
whether
any
specific
documents
had
to
be
filed
with
respect
to
whether
he
was
doing
business
as
a
firm.
in
the
--
this
case,
he
is
not
doing
business
under
a
company
name.
i
was
responding
--
noting
that
in
examining
some
of
the
registration
certificates,
which
are
in
file
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
that
they
have
a
location
which
says
the
nature
of
the
carrier,
the
ownership
of
the
carrier,
it
will
say
sole
proprietorship.
and
then
it
will
say,
“doing
business
as”.
now
in
this
case,
tolbert
hawkins
--
yes,
he
is
doing
business
as
tolbert
hawkins,
with
no
additional.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
and
i
might
--
no,
this
isn't
--
this
is
not
set
out
in
the
indictment.
perhaps
i
should
--
i
--
because
you
know,
he
has
14
trucks
and
some
17
employees
apparently.
as
i
say,
the
word
firm,
it
seems
to
us,
does
not
necessarily
connote
a
group
or
multiple
ownership.
we
think
what
it
really
means
in
this
context
is
the
business
of
--
carrying
on
the
business
of
interstate
commerce.
i
might
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
this
statute
didn't
come
out
full
blown
and
born
in
1948,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
was
a
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
this
derived
from
the
clayton
act
provision
which
is
i
pointed
out
is
essentially
concerned
with
rail
--
embezzlement
of
railroads,
there's
no
question
about
that.
what
i
do
suggest
is
that
in
light
of
the
clear
purpose
of
congress
in
having
adopted
the
employee
provision,
that
it
would
be
strange
indeed
in
this
combination,
in
660,
there
was
an
intent
to
narrow
that
provision
to
exclude
employees
of
individually
owned
carriers
which
it
seems
to
me
are
the
most
in
need
of
this
protection
perhaps.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
and
down
further
in
the
statute,
they
refer
to
such
firm,
association
or
corporation
again.
it
--
i
might
--
the
suggestion
because
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
--
motivated
the
revisers.
but
i
think
from
the
face
of
it,
a
reasonable
explanation
is
that
they
started
with
412
and
then
added
409
(a).
and
then
in
starting
the
412,
they
used
the
phraseology
of
412
throughout
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
think
generally
speaking,
i
think
its
fair
and
appellee
agrees,
i
--
a
firm
has
generally
been
defined
as
the
equivalent
of
a
partnership.
now,
it
is
also
been
defined
--
it
is
also
been
defined
synonymous
with
company.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
as
synonymous
with
company,
and
the
word
“company”
there
are
numerous
decision
under
specific
statutes
with
the
word
company
has
been
defined
to
include
an
individual.
it's
interesting
in
this
connection
in
terms
of
the
word
firm
that
appellee
cites
a
case,
an
early
ohio
case
in
which
under
that
particular
statute,
the
court
said
that
firm
covers
only
partnerships
and
neither
private
corporations
nor
individuals.
23
years
later
under
an
entirely
different
statute,
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
the
word
“firm”
in
common
usage
was
sufficiently
broad
to
cover
corporations.
and
as
a
recent
wisconsin
decision
which
suggest
that
the
word
“firm”
means
a
business
association,
something
perhaps
less
than
a
partnership.
our
position
is
that
the
word
“firm”
should
be
determined
in
light
of
the
particular
statutory
purpose.
it
has
no
fixed
and
definite
meaning
that
the
common
understanding
it
seems
to
us
is
when
the
word
“firm”
is
used,
it
suggests
a
business.
it
doesn't
necessarily
or
absolutely
suggest
the
type
of
business
but
an
ongoing
business.
and
we
think
that
no
rule
of
strict
construction
of
penal
statutes
requires,
in
light
of
this
purpose,
any
other
narrower
reading
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
it
is
sufficient
if
the
words
are
given
their
fair
meaning
in
accord
with
the
evident
intent
of
congress.
and
we
think,
as
i
have
said,
that
congress
clearly
meant
to
protect
the
business
of
all
common
carriers
from
specific
kinds
of
employee
and
executive
embezzlement
that
the
word
“firm”
can
fairly
be
read
to
achieve
that
result.
and
that,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
indictment
should
be
reinstated.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
request
the
court's
permission
for
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles
of
the
tennessee
bar
to
argue
this
case
for
appellee's
pro
hac
vice.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
dismissing
an
indictment
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
charge
an
offense
under
the
statute
upon
which
it
was
based,
18
u.s.c.
660.
the
indictment
which
is
set
out
at
page
1
of
the
record
charged
that
while
riding
on
his
employer's
truck
moving
in
interstate
commerce,
appellee
embezzled
funds
belonging
to
his
employer
who
was
an
individual
engaged
in
commerce
as
a
common
carrier.
18
u.s.c.
660
proscribed
such
embezzlement
when
committed
by
an
employee
of
any
firm,
association,
or
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
as
a
common
carrier.
the
district
court
read
the
statutory
language
firm,
association,
corporation
as
excluding
from
the
statute's
coverage
individually
owned
carriers
and
accordingly
dismissed
the
indictment.
in
so
doing,
it
followed
the
lead
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
in
1950,
in
a
per
curiam
decision
earlier
reached
the
same
result.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
district
court
has
given
the
statute
an
unnecessarily
circumscribed
reading
contrary
to
the
underlying
legislative
purpose
and
not
commanded
by
the
statutory
language.
as
we
will
show
the
statute
in
general
and
the
employee
provision
in
particular,
protects
all
common
carriers
engaged
in
the
business
of
interstate
carrier,
irrespective
of
their
size,
and
no
matter
the
internal
business
structure
in
which
the
carrier
chooses
to
operate.
i
would
first
like
to
turn
to
an
examination
of
this
legislative
purpose
and
then
to
the
question
of
whether
the
actual
language
employed
in
the
statute
can
reasonably
be
read
and
fairly
understood
as
convened
to
this
purpose.
18
u.s.c.
660
is
an
amalgam
of
two
distinct
provisions
of
a
criminal
code
brought
together
by
the
1948
revision.
one,
dealing
with
embezzlement
by
executives
of
carriers
which
had
been
previously
section
412
of
the
1946
code,
and
the
other
with
certain
kinds
of
employee
embezzlement
which
had
been
section
409
of
the
1946
code.
the
employee
part
under
which
appellee
was
here
indicted
was
first
adopted
in
1946,
only
two
years
before
the
1948
revision
as
one
of
the
series
of
broadening
amendments
of
the
carlin
act
of
1913
which
had
its
aim,
the
protection
of
--
from
theft
of
property
entrusted
to
carriers
for
interstate
transportation.
the
1946
amendment
to
section
409,
streamlined
statutes
by
setting
it
up
in
separate
provisions,
broadened
it
to
cover
air
as
well
as
surface
transportation
and
embezzlement
as
well
as
larceny
and
in
addition,
added
section
409
(a)
(5)
which
is
set
out
at
page
9
of
our
brief.
in
essence,
this
section
provided
that
an
employee
of
any
carrier
who
embezzles
his
employer's
funds
while
riding
either
upon
any
vehicle
belonging
to
his
employer
shall
be
guilty
of
a
penalty
--
of
a
felony.
the
language
in
the
statute,
any
carrier
clearly
covered
all
forms
of
carrier
business
regardless
of
size
or
their
internal
business
structure.
indeed,
there
is
no
question
that
appellee
agrees
that
if
409
(a)
(5)
was
the
law
today
and
the
indictment
was
specifically
drawn
under
that
section,
the
indictment
was
quite
proper
and
authorized.
the
argument
is
made,
however,
that
the
congressional
purpose
was
changed
and
that
the
scope
of
409
(a)
(5)
was
narrow
by
virtue
of
its
combination
with
what
had
been
this
executive
provision,
section
412
of
the
1946
code
which
had
proscribed
embezzlements
by
any
president,
director,
officer,
or
manager
of
any
firm,
association
or
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
as
a
common
carrier.
the
result
of
the
1948
revision,
the
creation
of
section
660,
was
that
the
language
employee
of
any
carrier
was
substituted
and
the
language
of
the
statute
became
an
employee
of
any
firm,
association
or
corporation.
all
the
trustworthy
evidence
we
submit
points
to
the
fact
that
this
was
--
this
change
of
the
revises
did
not
narrow
the
statute
but
was
basically
a
stylistic
change
not
certainly
a
change
of
substance.
first
of
all,
section
412
as
it
had
existed
in
the
criminal
code
prior
to
the
1948
revision
does
not
require
such
a
reading.
it
derives
intact
from
section
9
of
the
clayton
act.
undeniably,
this
provision
adopted
almost
35
years
before
the
1948
revision
was
principally
concerned
and
meant
to
prevent
financial
depletion
of
railroad
businesses
through
executive
embezzlement.
it
is,
however,
also
a
fair
inference
we
think
to
draw
from
both
the
language
of
the
section
9
and
from
some
of
the
senate
debate
that
the
intent
was
more
broad
--
was
broader,
that
in
addition
to
protecting
against
embezzlement
by
executives
of
railroads,
congress
aimed
at
serving
the
public
interest
in
protecting
all
interstate
carriers
from
impairment
of
effective
operation
through
embezzlement
by
executives.
as
one
of
the
managers
of
the
senate
bill
said
of
section
9,
we
are
dealing
with
all
carriers
alike.
this
view
is
supported
by
the
language,
the
comprehensive
language
used.
if
congress
have
merely
decided
to
reach
multiple
ownership
carriers,
the
words
“corporation
and
association”
would
have
been
sufficient
since
associations
would
include
partnerships.
by
also
using
the
word
firm,
congress,
we
submit
indicated
its
intent
to
cover
all
carriers
in
the
business
of
common
carriage
without
regard
to
form
of
ownership,
the
form
of
ownership.
in
addition,
it
is
significant
i
think
that
section
9
jurisdiction
was
not
based
upon
size
of
the
carrier
but
on
the
connection
of
the
embezzled
funds
to
commoners.
this
provision,
section
9,
was
thereafter
carried
over
into
the
criminal
code
in
1926,
and
every
six
to
eight
years
thereafter,
whenever
a
new
addition
of
the
code
was
published,
and
in
1948
was
combined
with
section
409
(a)
(5).
there
is
no
cogent
reason
apart
from
the
language
of
412
submitted
by
appellee
or
the
court
below
why
congress
would've
limited
the
scope
of
409
(a)
(5)
in
the
1948
revision.
appellee
urges
an
explanation
of
this
cutting
down
that
the
employees
of
individual
carriers
on
--
on
the
truck
employees
of
individual
carriers
and
their
acts
of
embezzlement
would
involve
small
amounts
and
not
be
within
the
congressional
concern.
the
sure
answer
to
that
is
that
the
employee
provision
only
applies
to
employees
who
worked
on
the
trucks
of
carriers
and
whether
the
carrier
is
a
multiple
ownership
carrier
or
individually
owned
carrier.
it
would
have
been
very
strange
indeed,
we
submit,
if
congress,
having
undertaken
to
protect
the
small
as
well
as
the
large
carriers
would
have
through
the
--
by
the
way
of
a
revision,
change
that
purpose
to
exclude
the
individually
owned
small
carrier.
we
have
made
a
random
survey
of
about
ten
percent
of
the
--
some
11,700
odd
common
carriers
with
an
annual
revenue
of
$200,000
or
less.
and
we
find
that
almost
40%
of
those
carriers
were
individually
owned,
many
operating
under
a
company
name
and
having
over
2000
employees
and
during
the
same
period
of
time,
during
1964,
only
one
percent
of
the
carriers
registered
operated
as
partnerships.
quite
appropriate
here
is
what
the
court
said
in
united
states
against
a
&
p
trucking
company
at
358
u.s.
which
held
that
a
partnership
was
an
entity
for
purposes
of
criminal
prosecution
under
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935.
the
court
said,
the
conclusion
is
not
likely
to
be
reached
that
congress
intended
that
some
carriers
should
not
be
subject
to
the
full
gamut
of
sanctions
provided
for
infractions
of
icc
regulations
merely
because
of
the
form
under
which
they
were
organized
to
do
business.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i'm
quoting
from
united
states
against
a
&
p
trucking
company,
your
honor
at
358
u.s.
this
approach
which
seems
to
us
is
even
more
applicable
here.
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
could
have
intended
that
small
carrier,
the
carrier
perhaps
more
in
need
of
protection
than
any
other
carrier.
and
would
not
be
under
the
act
and
that
the
jurisdiction
would
depend
upon
whether
an
individual
chose
to
do
business
as
a
sole
proprietorship
even
though
he
had
the
name
company
after
the
sole
proprietorship
or
as
a
one-man
corporation.
finally,
we
submit
in
this
connection
that
congress
would
hardly
have
sought
this
change
if
it
so
intended
through
the
means
of
a
revision.
the
reviser's
note
accompanying
section
660
make
plain
that
the
original
intent
of
congress
is
preserved
and
that
a
uniform
style
of
statutory
expression
is
adopted.
also,
in
the
practice
to
title
18
u.s.c.
the
reviser
state
in
general,
with
few
exceptions,
the
code
does
not
attempt
to
change
existing
law.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
employee
would
have
to
be
an
employee
of
any
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
our
basic
position
is
that
the
word
firm
connotes
a
business
entity
rather
than
a
multiple
ownership.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
409
(a)
(5)
was
an
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
right.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
firm,
association
or
corporation
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
read
firm
and
the
words
in
combination
as
in
indicating
a
congressional
intent
to
reach
the
business
of
interstate
carriage,
be
--
an
ongoing
carrier
business
rather
than
congress
having
any
concern
with
the
internal
structure
of
the
business
or
the
way
a
carrier
decides
to
operate
his
business.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
as
far
as
i
know,
i
do
not
know
of
any
such
requirement,
there
may
be
one.
i
might
add
mr.
justice
brennan
that
in
the
course
of
examining
these
registration
certificates,
they
have
a
portion
which
says,
“the
nature
of
ownership,”
and
they
would
say
sole
proprietor,
named,
doing
business
as
of
jones
transfer
company,
and
these
are
individually
owned
carriers,
but
doing
businesses
as
companies.
and
this
brings
me
precisely
to
the
major
argument
that
appellee
makes,
and
that
is
that
the
word
firm
has
some
fixed
indefinite
common
law
meaning
or
other
meaning
which
necessarily
excludes
carriers
from
coverage.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
yes
and
he
was
an
employee
of
an
individual
tolbert
hawkins
engaged
in
commerce
as
a
common
carrier.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
hakwins
has
a
--
a
registration
certificate
had
been
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
in
the
name
of
tolbert
hawkins.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
did
not
know
whether
any
specific
documents
had
to
be
filed
with
respect
to
whether
he
was
doing
business
as
a
firm.
in
the
--
this
case,
he
is
not
doing
business
under
a
company
name.
i
was
responding
--
noting
that
in
examining
some
of
the
registration
certificates,
which
are
in
file
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
that
they
have
a
location
which
says
the
nature
of
the
carrier,
the
ownership
of
the
carrier,
it
will
say
sole
proprietorship.
and
then
it
will
say,
“doing
business
as”.
now
in
this
case,
tolbert
hawkins
--
yes,
he
is
doing
business
as
tolbert
hawkins,
with
no
additional.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
and
i
might
--
no,
this
isn't
--
this
is
not
set
out
in
the
indictment.
perhaps
i
should
--
i
--
because
you
know,
he
has
14
trucks
and
some
17
employees
apparently.
as
i
say,
the
word
firm,
it
seems
to
us,
does
not
necessarily
connote
a
group
or
multiple
ownership.
we
think
what
it
really
means
in
this
context
is
the
business
of
--
carrying
on
the
business
of
interstate
commerce.
i
might
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
this
statute
didn't
come
out
full
blown
and
born
in
1948,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
was
a
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
this
derived
from
the
clayton
act
provision
which
is
i
pointed
out
is
essentially
concerned
with
rail
--
embezzlement
of
railroads,
there's
no
question
about
that.
what
i
do
suggest
is
that
in
light
of
the
clear
purpose
of
congress
in
having
adopted
the
employee
provision,
that
it
would
be
strange
indeed
in
this
combination,
in
660,
there
was
an
intent
to
narrow
that
provision
to
exclude
employees
of
individually
owned
carriers
which
it
seems
to
me
are
the
most
in
need
of
this
protection
perhaps.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
and
down
further
in
the
statute,
they
refer
to
such
firm,
association
or
corporation
again.
it
--
i
might
--
the
suggestion
because
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
--
motivated
the
revisers.
but
i
think
from
the
face
of
it,
a
reasonable
explanation
is
that
they
started
with
412
and
then
added
409
(a).
and
then
in
starting
the
412,
they
used
the
phraseology
of
412
throughout
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
think
generally
speaking,
i
think
its
fair
and
appellee
agrees,
i
--
a
firm
has
generally
been
defined
as
the
equivalent
of
a
partnership.
now,
it
is
also
been
defined
--
it
is
also
been
defined
synonymous
with
company.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
as
synonymous
with
company,
and
the
word
“company”
there
are
numerous
decision
under
specific
statutes
with
the
word
company
has
been
defined
to
include
an
individual.
it's
interesting
in
this
connection
in
terms
of
the
word
firm
that
appellee
cites
a
case,
an
early
ohio
case
in
which
under
that
particular
statute,
the
court
said
that
firm
covers
only
partnerships
and
neither
private
corporations
nor
individuals.
23
years
later
under
an
entirely
different
statute,
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
the
word
“firm”
in
common
usage
was
sufficiently
broad
to
cover
corporations.
and
as
a
recent
wisconsin
decision
which
suggest
that
the
word
“firm”
means
a
business
association,
something
perhaps
less
than
a
partnership.
our
position
is
that
the
word
“firm”
should
be
determined
in
light
of
the
particular
statutory
purpose.
it
has
no
fixed
and
definite
meaning
that
the
common
understanding
it
seems
to
us
is
when
the
word
“firm”
is
used,
it
suggests
a
business.
it
doesn't
necessarily
or
absolutely
suggest
the
type
of
business
but
an
ongoing
business.
and
we
think
that
no
rule
of
strict
construction
of
penal
statutes
requires,
in
light
of
this
purpose,
any
other
narrower
reading
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
it
is
sufficient
if
the
words
are
given
their
fair
meaning
in
accord
with
the
evident
intent
of
congress.
and
we
think,
as
i
have
said,
that
congress
clearly
meant
to
protect
the
business
of
all
common
carriers
from
specific
kinds
of
employee
and
executive
embezzlement
that
the
word
“firm”
can
fairly
be
read
to
achieve
that
result.
and
that,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
indictment
should
be
reinstated.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
oh,
i'm
sorry

mr.
