justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me,
mr.
feit,
i
gather
this
all
comes
down
to
an
argument
that
the
word
modifying
common
carriers
should
be
in
effect
read
out
of
the
statute,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
409
(a)
(5)
was
employee
of
any
carrier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
660
now
is
an
employee
of
such
a
common
carrier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
going
back
to
firm,
association,
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
argument
is
not
that
we
should
ignore
the
word
such,
but
rather
should
read
the
firm,
the
word
“firm”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
appreciate
it
--
wouldn't
appear
on
the
face
if
this
is
only
under
your
indictment,
isn't
it?
dismissal
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering.
is
there
any
federal
requirement,
an
icc
requirement
of
filing
of
something
we
used
to
call
in
my
home
state
a
dba,
doing
business
under
the
name
of
something
else?
is
there
anything
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
so,
they
didn't
need
the
word
association
or
corporation,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
is
the
one
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
derived
from
the
executive
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
we
get
nothing
from
the
legislative
history
when
they
took
over
409
(a)
(5),
they
used
the
identical
language
except
that
they
inserted
the
word
such
to
modify
common
carrier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
peebles,
may
i
interrupt
this
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
the
indictment
indicated
where
--
in
what
state
does
that
collection
referred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
said
--
do
i
take
it
that
therefore,
it
would
be
i
suppose,
subject
to
constitution
under
tennessee
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
been
any
prosecution?
i
know
this
is
outside
of
the
record
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
i
take
it,
even
if
accidental,
not
intended
by
the
revisers,
all
because
of
the
principle
of
strict
construction
of
criminal
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
from
what
--
from
what
in
the
legislative
history,
since
this
was
a
revision
and
a
merger
of
the
two
sections,
can
there
be
drawn
any
inference
that
congress
intended
to
limit
the
employee
statute
--
was
that
409
(a)
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it,
they
did
that
only
because
they
approved
the
revision.
i
meant,
in
other
words,
congress
never
addressed
itself
to
that
problem
directly,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
accepted
the
proposal
of
the
revisers
that
these
two
statutes
would
be
merged
into
this
one
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
see
this
revision
mr.
peebles
was
made
--
how
many
years
before
schmokey
was
decided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
argument
is
that
congress
didn't
agree,
they
should
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
put
the
word
person
back
or
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

taken
out
the

“such”?
