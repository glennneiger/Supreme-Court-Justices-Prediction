mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
gather
from
the
argument
of
counsel
and
from
the
briefs
that
there
really
is
no
disagreement
as
to
the
origin
or
the
legislative
history
of
section
660.
the
divergence
of
opinion
arises
in
the
inferences
which
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history
and
as
to
the
fair
meaning
of
the
word
“firm”.
without
questions,
660
was
derived
from
a
merger
of
section
412
and
section
409
(a)
(5)
of
the
criminal
code
on
1946.
section
412,
the
executive
embezzlement
provision
used
the
phrases
firm,
association,
or
corporation
to
designate
the
entities
protecting
it.
section
409
(a)
(5)
on
the
other
hand
uses
a
terminology
--
that
is
the
employee
embezzlement
provision,
used
the
distinct
terminology
in
a
carrier.
i
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
believe
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
your
honor,
i
don't
know
because
i've
never
seen
the
defendant
since
he
was
dismissed.
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
him.
so
we
have
two
distinct
sections
which
are
predecessors
to
section
660
and
they
utilized
different
terminology.
now
i
think
there's
a
reason
for
that.
the
executive
embezzlement
provision
which
punished
named
executives
of
a
firm,
association,
or
corporation,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
logical
or
appropriate
to
use
in
that
phrase
or
in
that
section
of
the
code
any
person
or
any
individual
firm,
association,
or
corporation
because
the
executive
of
an
individually
owned
carrier
would
normally
be
the
owner.
on
the
other
hand,
409
(a)
(5)
uses
much
broader
language,
the
language
“any
carrier”
which
is
a
specific
language
which
congress
deleted
when
it
merged
the
two
sections
to
form
section
660
and
inserted,
in
lieu
of
that
provision,
any
such
carrier
referring
to
--
any
such
carrier
of
a
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct.
so,
the
government
contends
and
we
agree.
we
think
they're
correct
about
it,
that
the
predecessor
to
section
660,
the
employee
embezzlement
provision
409
(a)
(5)
clearly
would
have
included
the
offense
which
is
now
before
the
court,
without
question.
any
carrier
is
broad
enough
to
include
an
individually
owned
carrier.
but
we
have
quite
a
different
situation
now
because
of
the
revision.
in
other
words,
what
was
once
perfectly
clear
is
not
clear
at
all.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
of
course
in
this
case
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
schmokey
case
have
held
that
the
statute
660
no
longer
covers
individuals
operating
as
common
carriers.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
don't
think
necessarily
so,
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
there
is
more
to
it.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
it's
enough
to
simply
use
the
magic
phrase
“strict
construction.”
i
think
that
the
courts
have
arrived
at
this
conclusion,
the
schmokey
case,
and
i
feel
reasonably
certain
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
arrived
at
this
conclusion
because
conflicting
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history
and
because
you
do
have
two
readings
of
the
word
“firm.”
it's
possible
to
read
firm,
as
the
government
contend.
it's
also
possible
to
read
firm
in
its
ordinary
sense
which
i
submit
is
partnership.
so
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
this,
number
one,
from
the
very
action
which
congress
took
in
substituting
the
language.
in
other
words,
congress
retained
the
language
of
412,
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
but
congress
specifically
eliminated
the
language
“any
carrier”
which
had
been
contained
in
section
409.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
probably
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
think
that's
probably
true.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
would
not
disagree
at
all
that
firm
could
fairly
be
read
to
include
a
corporation.
and
i
would
not
disagree
at
all
that
firm
could
fairly
be
read
to
include
an
association.
i
don't
think
their
generally
thought
of
is
that,
but
i
think
they
can
fairly
be
read
to
include
those
entities.
but
i
don't
think
that
--
as
i
have
stated
in
my
brief,
i
have
never
found
a
case
which
has
ever
held
the
term
“firm”
to
be
synonymous
with
an
individual.
that
doesn't
mean,
as
counsel
has
suggested,
that
perhaps
i
have
suggested
that
“firm”
has
a
definite
and
fixed
meaning.
i
recognized
that
different
words
or
the
same
word
has
different
meanings
for
different
purposes.
but
in
this
particular
case,
going
back
to
the
court's
question,
we
have
--
first,
specific
changes
by
congress,
that
in
itself
must
designate
something.
it
must
have
some
meaning.
i
think
from
that
alone,
an
inference
can
be
drawn
that
congress
did
intend
to
eliminate
individual
carriers
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now,
why
they
intended
to
do
it,
i
cannot
answer
it.
i
don't
know.
but,
looking
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
section
again,
the
predecessor
or
the
larceny
provision
which
preceded
section
409
and
section
412,
enumerated
any
person,
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
thus
clearly
congress
recognized
a
distinction
between
person
doing
business,
theft
or
embezzlement
from
a
person
or
individual,
and
theft
from
a
firm.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
bill
which
it
was
--
that's
s.
739
i
believe
which
is
cited
by
the
government,
senator
mccarran's
bill
which
certainly
made
--
recognized
the
distinction
between
a
person
and
a
firm.
s.
739
enumerated
specifically
any
person,
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
congress
has
consistently
considered
a
person
and
firm
as
distinct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
agree,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
is
possible
to
do.
but,
i
think,
as
i
read
the
statute,
such
common
carriers
does
refer
--
“such”
does
refer
to
the
entities
which
have
previously
been
enumerated
in
the
statute,
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
i
think
the
government
has
interpreted
in
that
manner
and
certainly
both
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
schmokey
case
have
interpreted
the
statute
in
that
manner.
i
do
not
think
it's
impossible
to
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
well
again,
i
don't
know
if
i've
answered
the
court's
question
but
i
--
it
just
seems
to
me
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
would
require
that
such
carrier,
such
common
carrier
makes
reference
back
to
firm,
association,
or
corporation
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
--
and
not
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
can
find
nothing
on
that,
if
your
honor
please.
the
only
point
that
i
was
making
on
that
is
that
congress
has
consistently
prior
to
this
enactment
of
section
660,
has
consistently
considered
person
and
firm
as
distinct.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
why
--
as
the
government
contends,
if
this
statute
is
designed
to
protect
all
common
carriers
regardless
of
their
form
of
ownership
--
in
other
words,
are
broad,
comprehensive
statute
such
as
that,
it's
different
to
me
why
congress
--
for
me
to
see
why
congress
didn't
just
used
the
firm
--
the
term
“any
carrier”.
certainly,
that's
the
broader
and
more
comprehensive
language
but
congress,
for
some
reason
which
we
don't
know
because
the
legislative
history
doesn't
specifically
tell
us,
did
not
do
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
my
guess
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
this
is
an
omission.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
the
best
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
think
that's
the
most
logical
explanation
frankly.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
correct
the
errors
of
congress.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
congress
could
--
it's
been
15
years
since
the
schmokey
case
made
--
decided
this
case
or
decided
this
same
issue.
and
congress
could
have
acted
had
it
so
desired.
this
would
be
very
simple
to
amend.
all
you
have
to
do
--
all
that
congress
would
have
to
so
do
is
to
eliminate
the
word
“such”
it
appears
to
me.
but
congress
hasn't
done
that.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
an
error
which
the
congress
and
not
this
court
should
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i'm
certain
he
knew
it
was
wrong,
if
your
honor
please.
it
would
have
been
punishable
under
state
law.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
don't
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
well,
i
agree
that
this
statute
is
vague.
and
what
is
more
important
is
that
at
one
time,
the
statute
was
perfectly
clear.
409
(a)
(5)
would
have
covered
this
without
any
question,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
but
for
the
acts
of
congress
in
changing
the
statutory
wording.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
the
only
logical
purpose
and
it
does
not
hold
true
in
all
cases
if
your
honor
please,
that
i
could
think
of
is
this.
the
justice
department
apparently
opposed
this
statutory
provision
or
the
embezzlement
provisions
from
the
outset
because
the
justice
department
felt
that
it
would
bring
into
court
a
number
--
or
into
the
federal
courts,
a
number
of
small
cases
involving
small
amounts
embezzlements.
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
theft
of
--
or
the
alleged
embezzlement
of
$200
accruing
from
an
interstate
shipment
of
bananas.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
may
have
intended
to
eliminate
just
that
type
of
case.
it
would
not
hold
through
though
--
that
argument
does
not
hold
through
in
all
situations
because
you
could
have
a
small
partnership
and
the
same
thing
would
apply,
you
could
have
a
small
embezzlement
which
would
still
go
into
the
federal
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
think
that
is
true,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
well
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
may
it
please
the
court,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
necessarily
true.
what
puzzles
me
is
this
--
apparently,
there
had
been
only
two
cases
which
have
arisen
under
this
--
under
section
660.
something
is
--
i
don't
think
that
all
employees
have
stopped
embezzling
the
funds
of
interstate
carriers.
something
is
--
some
disposal
of
these
facts
of
cases
is
being
made
and
it
appears
to
me
that
perhaps
state
laws
have
been
adequate
to
cope
with
the
situation.
if
that
were
not
true,
it
appears
to
me
that
trucking
associations
would
have
--
put
some
pressure
upon
congress
to
change
the
decision
in
the
schmokey
case.
in
other
words,
to
revise
section
660,
but
nothing
has
been
done
along
those
lines
as
far
as
i
can
determine.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
well,
there
was
--
there's
no
question
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
true.
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
prove
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
believe,
two
years.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
believe
the
revision
is
from
1948.
i
believe
schmokey
was
decided
in
1950.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
they
could
have
substituted
--
or
inserted
the
word
“person”
or
they
could
have
just
--
they
could
strike
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
strike
the
word
“such”.
but
i
don't
necessarily
mean
to
imply
that
congress
play
--
failure
to
act
in
this
respect
is
conclusive
of
legislative
approval
of
the
schmokey
case's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
it
does
point
in
that
direction
and
it
does
tend
--
to
me,
it
tends
to
deflate
the
government's
arguments
that
we've
got
such
an
enormous
problem
of
employee
embezzlements
from
individual
carriers.
somehow,
these
situations
are
being
dealt
with
perhaps
by
the
state
courts.
i
don't
know.
in
conclusion,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
point
out
that
--
just
in
summary
that
i
think
conflicting
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history,
number
one,
from
the
very
acts
which
congress
has
done
in
changing
the
statutory
language.
number
two,
from
the
legislative
history
and
that
congress
has
always
considered
a
person
or
individual
as
distinct
from
firm.
and
finally,
firm
as
i
have
stated,
in
its
ordinary
usage
by
every
case
which
i
have
ever
found
has
determined
that
language
to
mean
or
to
be
synonymous
with
partnership
and
never
individual.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
gather
from
the
argument
of
counsel
and
from
the
briefs
that
there
really
is
no
disagreement
as
to
the
origin
or
the
legislative
history
of
section
660.
the
divergence
of
opinion
arises
in
the
inferences
which
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history
and
as
to
the
fair
meaning
of
the
word
“firm”.
without
questions,
660
was
derived
from
a
merger
of
section
412
and
section
409
(a)
(5)
of
the
criminal
code
on
1946.
section
412,
the
executive
embezzlement
provision
used
the
phrases
firm,
association,
or
corporation
to
designate
the
entities
protecting
it.
section
409
(a)
(5)
on
the
other
hand
uses
a
terminology
--
that
is
the
employee
embezzlement
provision,
used
the
distinct
terminology
in
a
carrier.
i
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
believe
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
your
honor,
i
don't
know
because
i've
never
seen
the
defendant
since
he
was
dismissed.
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
him.
so
we
have
two
distinct
sections
which
are
predecessors
to
section
660
and
they
utilized
different
terminology.
now
i
think
there's
a
reason
for
that.
the
executive
embezzlement
provision
which
punished
named
executives
of
a
firm,
association,
or
corporation,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
logical
or
appropriate
to
use
in
that
phrase
or
in
that
section
of
the
code
any
person
or
any
individual
firm,
association,
or
corporation
because
the
executive
of
an
individually
owned
carrier
would
normally
be
the
owner.
on
the
other
hand,
409
(a)
(5)
uses
much
broader
language,
the
language
“any
carrier”
which
is
a
specific
language
which
congress
deleted
when
it
merged
the
two
sections
to
form
section
660
and
inserted,
in
lieu
of
that
provision,
any
such
carrier
referring
to
--
any
such
carrier
of
a
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct.
so,
the
government
contends
and
we
agree.
we
think
they're
correct
about
it,
that
the
predecessor
to
section
660,
the
employee
embezzlement
provision
409
(a)
(5)
clearly
would
have
included
the
offense
which
is
now
before
the
court,
without
question.
any
carrier
is
broad
enough
to
include
an
individually
owned
carrier.
but
we
have
quite
a
different
situation
now
because
of
the
revision.
in
other
words,
what
was
once
perfectly
clear
is
not
clear
at
all.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
of
course
in
this
case
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
schmokey
case
have
held
that
the
statute
660
no
longer
covers
individuals
operating
as
common
carriers.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
don't
think
necessarily
so,
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
there
is
more
to
it.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
it's
enough
to
simply
use
the
magic
phrase
“strict
construction.”
i
think
that
the
courts
have
arrived
at
this
conclusion,
the
schmokey
case,
and
i
feel
reasonably
certain
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
arrived
at
this
conclusion
because
conflicting
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history
and
because
you
do
have
two
readings
of
the
word
“firm.”
it's
possible
to
read
firm,
as
the
government
contend.
it's
also
possible
to
read
firm
in
its
ordinary
sense
which
i
submit
is
partnership.
so
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
this,
number
one,
from
the
very
action
which
congress
took
in
substituting
the
language.
in
other
words,
congress
retained
the
language
of
412,
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
but
congress
specifically
eliminated
the
language
“any
carrier”
which
had
been
contained
in
section
409.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
probably
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
think
that's
probably
true.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
would
not
disagree
at
all
that
firm
could
fairly
be
read
to
include
a
corporation.
and
i
would
not
disagree
at
all
that
firm
could
fairly
be
read
to
include
an
association.
i
don't
think
their
generally
thought
of
is
that,
but
i
think
they
can
fairly
be
read
to
include
those
entities.
but
i
don't
think
that
--
as
i
have
stated
in
my
brief,
i
have
never
found
a
case
which
has
ever
held
the
term
“firm”
to
be
synonymous
with
an
individual.
that
doesn't
mean,
as
counsel
has
suggested,
that
perhaps
i
have
suggested
that
“firm”
has
a
definite
and
fixed
meaning.
i
recognized
that
different
words
or
the
same
word
has
different
meanings
for
different
purposes.
but
in
this
particular
case,
going
back
to
the
court's
question,
we
have
--
first,
specific
changes
by
congress,
that
in
itself
must
designate
something.
it
must
have
some
meaning.
i
think
from
that
alone,
an
inference
can
be
drawn
that
congress
did
intend
to
eliminate
individual
carriers
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now,
why
they
intended
to
do
it,
i
cannot
answer
it.
i
don't
know.
but,
looking
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
section
again,
the
predecessor
or
the
larceny
provision
which
preceded
section
409
and
section
412,
enumerated
any
person,
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
thus
clearly
congress
recognized
a
distinction
between
person
doing
business,
theft
or
embezzlement
from
a
person
or
individual,
and
theft
from
a
firm.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
bill
which
it
was
--
that's
s.
739
i
believe
which
is
cited
by
the
government,
senator
mccarran's
bill
which
certainly
made
--
recognized
the
distinction
between
a
person
and
a
firm.
s.
739
enumerated
specifically
any
person,
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
congress
has
consistently
considered
a
person
and
firm
as
distinct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
agree,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
is
possible
to
do.
but,
i
think,
as
i
read
the
statute,
such
common
carriers
does
refer
--
“such”
does
refer
to
the
entities
which
have
previously
been
enumerated
in
the
statute,
firm,
association,
or
corporation.
i
think
the
government
has
interpreted
in
that
manner
and
certainly
both
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
schmokey
case
have
interpreted
the
statute
in
that
manner.
i
do
not
think
it's
impossible
to
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
well
again,
i
don't
know
if
i've
answered
the
court's
question
but
i
--
it
just
seems
to
me
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
would
require
that
such
carrier,
such
common
carrier
makes
reference
back
to
firm,
association,
or
corporation
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
--
and
not
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
can
find
nothing
on
that,
if
your
honor
please.
the
only
point
that
i
was
making
on
that
is
that
congress
has
consistently
prior
to
this
enactment
of
section
660,
has
consistently
considered
person
and
firm
as
distinct.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
why
--
as
the
government
contends,
if
this
statute
is
designed
to
protect
all
common
carriers
regardless
of
their
form
of
ownership
--
in
other
words,
are
broad,
comprehensive
statute
such
as
that,
it's
different
to
me
why
congress
--
for
me
to
see
why
congress
didn't
just
used
the
firm
--
the
term
“any
carrier”.
certainly,
that's
the
broader
and
more
comprehensive
language
but
congress,
for
some
reason
which
we
don't
know
because
the
legislative
history
doesn't
specifically
tell
us,
did
not
do
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
my
guess
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
this
is
an
omission.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
the
best
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
think
that's
the
most
logical
explanation
frankly.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
correct
the
errors
of
congress.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
congress
could
--
it's
been
15
years
since
the
schmokey
case
made
--
decided
this
case
or
decided
this
same
issue.
and
congress
could
have
acted
had
it
so
desired.
this
would
be
very
simple
to
amend.
all
you
have
to
do
--
all
that
congress
would
have
to
so
do
is
to
eliminate
the
word
“such”
it
appears
to
me.
but
congress
hasn't
done
that.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
an
error
which
the
congress
and
not
this
court
should
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i'm
certain
he
knew
it
was
wrong,
if
your
honor
please.
it
would
have
been
punishable
under
state
law.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
don't
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
well,
i
agree
that
this
statute
is
vague.
and
what
is
more
important
is
that
at
one
time,
the
statute
was
perfectly
clear.
409
(a)
(5)
would
have
covered
this
without
any
question,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
but
for
the
acts
of
congress
in
changing
the
statutory
wording.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
the
only
logical
purpose
and
it
does
not
hold
true
in
all
cases
if
your
honor
please,
that
i
could
think
of
is
this.
the
justice
department
apparently
opposed
this
statutory
provision
or
the
embezzlement
provisions
from
the
outset
because
the
justice
department
felt
that
it
would
bring
into
court
a
number
--
or
into
the
federal
courts,
a
number
of
small
cases
involving
small
amounts
embezzlements.
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
theft
of
--
or
the
alleged
embezzlement
of
$200
accruing
from
an
interstate
shipment
of
bananas.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
may
have
intended
to
eliminate
just
that
type
of
case.
it
would
not
hold
through
though
--
that
argument
does
not
hold
through
in
all
situations
because
you
could
have
a
small
partnership
and
the
same
thing
would
apply,
you
could
have
a
small
embezzlement
which
would
still
go
into
the
federal
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
think
that
is
true,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
well
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
may
it
please
the
court,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
necessarily
true.
what
puzzles
me
is
this
--
apparently,
there
had
been
only
two
cases
which
have
arisen
under
this
--
under
section
660.
something
is
--
i
don't
think
that
all
employees
have
stopped
embezzling
the
funds
of
interstate
carriers.
something
is
--
some
disposal
of
these
facts
of
cases
is
being
made
and
it
appears
to
me
that
perhaps
state
laws
have
been
adequate
to
cope
with
the
situation.
if
that
were
not
true,
it
appears
to
me
that
trucking
associations
would
have
--
put
some
pressure
upon
congress
to
change
the
decision
in
the
schmokey
case.
in
other
words,
to
revise
section
660,
but
nothing
has
been
done
along
those
lines
as
far
as
i
can
determine.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
well,
there
was
--
there's
no
question
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
true.
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
prove
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
believe,
two
years.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
i
believe
the
revision
is
from
1948.
i
believe
schmokey
was
decided
in
1950.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
they
could
have
substituted
--
or
inserted
the
word
“person”
or
they
could
have
just
--
they
could
strike
--
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
strike
the
word
“such”.
but
i
don't
necessarily
mean
to
imply
that
congress
play
--
failure
to
act
in
this
respect
is
conclusive
of
legislative
approval
of
the
schmokey
case's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
it
does
point
in
that
direction
and
it
does
tend
--
to
me,
it
tends
to
deflate
the
government's
arguments
that
we've
got
such
an
enormous
problem
of
employee
embezzlements
from
individual
carriers.
somehow,
these
situations
are
being
dealt
with
perhaps
by
the
state
courts.
i
don't
know.
in
conclusion,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
point
out
that
--
just
in
summary
that
i
think
conflicting
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history,
number
one,
from
the
very
acts
which
congress
has
done
in
changing
the
statutory
language.
number
two,
from
the
legislative
history
and
that
congress
has
always
considered
a
person
or
individual
as
distinct
from
firm.
and
finally,
firm
as
i
have
stated,
in
its
ordinary
usage
by
every
case
which
i
have
ever
found
has
determined
that
language
to
mean
or
to
be
synonymous
with
partnership
and
never
individual.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
h.
peebles,
iii
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
