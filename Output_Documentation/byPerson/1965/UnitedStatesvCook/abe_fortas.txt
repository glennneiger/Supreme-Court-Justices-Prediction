possibility,

it
is
a
possibility,
that
is
to
say
that
the
case
may
not
turn
on
the
construction
of
the
word
“firm.”
if
you
read
the
following
phrase
referring
to
such
common
carrier
as
relating
only
to
the
common
carrier
engaged
in
commerce,
have
i
made
the
point
clear?
justice

that
is
--
that
is
perhaps
it
could
be
said
that
--
in
that
the
second
phrase
or
whoever
being
an
employee
of
such
common
carrier
really
means
whoever
being
an
employee
of
a
common
carrier
engaged
in
commerce,
and
that
such
does
not
relate
back
to
firm,
association,
or
corporation
but
relates
back
to
engaged
in
commerce.
i
know
that
that
is
not
crystal
clear
but
i
don't
think
anything
in
this
statute
is
crystal
clear.
but
i
thought
--
i
had
thought
i'd
--
it
would
be
clear,
and
i'd
like
to
get
your
comment
on
that
reading.
justice
abe
fortas
i
noticed
in
the
balance
of
the
statute,
say
--
an
employee
of
such
common
carrier,
an
employee
riding
in
or
upon
in
a
railroad
car,
and
then
skip,
moving
interstate
commerce,
embezzles,
etcetera,
then
you
follow
it
down
and
then
again,
they
use
a
formula,
embezzles,
etcetera,
assets
of
such
firm,
association,
or
corporation
arising
from
--
arising
or
accruing
from,
or
used
in
such
commerce,
which
seems
to
be
a
reference
to
--
back
to
the
phrase
interstate
commerce.
i'm
--
i
am
by
no
means
sure
of
this
but
i
did
want
to
submit
it
to
you,
through
your
comment.
justice

yes.

there's
nothing
whatever
in
the
substance

legislative
history,
i
take
it,
that
it

a
specific
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
narrow
the
old
thrust
of
409
(a)
(5).
