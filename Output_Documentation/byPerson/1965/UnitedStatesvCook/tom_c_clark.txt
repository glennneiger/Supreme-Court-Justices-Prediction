in
that,
an
employee
--
if
he
is
an
employee
of
an
individual
tolbert
hawkins,
for

isn't
he?
justice
tom

so
hawkins
apparently
has
a
license
from
icc
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
the
name
of
tolbert
hawkins?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
he
is
doing
business
as,
wouldn't
be
a

at

it?
he
doesn't
have
to

he's
doing
business
as
a
firm
because
he's
not
doing
business
as
a

he's
been
doing
business

doing
something
that's
proscribed

it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
fellow
evidently
used

taking
his
money
was
proscribed

justice
tom
c.
clark
--
he
isn't
wrong,
is
he?
justice
tom
c.

yes.
