justice
abe
fortas
miss
rosenberg
can
you
read
281
as
applying
to
proceedings
in
the
congress
or
before
a
committee
of
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
statute
am
i
supposed
to
be
looking
at?
justice
abe
fortas
miss
rosenberg,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
help
me
out.
as
i
understand
and
what
you
have
is
charge
of
a
conspiracy.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
have
just
dissent
that
in
order
to
make
it
true,
you
have
to
use
the
fact
that
the
congressman
made
a
speech.
that
is
what
your
stand
upon
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
permit
me
to
ask
you
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
don't
mind.
now,
would
you
agree
that
if
the
government
has
filed
it's
proof
of
conspiracy
and
used
the
text
of
the
speech
and
had
gone
into
the
substance
of
the
speech,
would
you
or
would
you
not
feel
that
that's
--
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
now,
he
has
us
told
us
earlier,
if
i
correctly
remember,
that
the
government
did
use
a
substance
of
the
speech
in
the
cross
examination
of
congressman
johnson?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that,
is
this
--
does
this
case
present
essentially
on
your
view
of
it
a
question
of
degree,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
government
used
the
speech
or
went
in
to
the
speech
in
such
a
degree
to
such
amount
or
for
such
a
purposes
or
how
do
you
want
to
phrase
it,
as
to
violate
the
constitutional
immunity?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
sometimes
--
sometimes,
this
court
as
i
understand
[inaudible]
things
the
other
way
around.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
doub,
the
other
aspect
of
this
case
as
i
understand
it
is
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
accepting
money
and
thereafter
on
account
of
the
acceptance
of
the
money,
making
representations
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
department
of
justice.
but
now,
i
take
it,
you
do
not
challenge
the
validity
of
that
of
that
count.
justice
abe
fortas
however,
that
maybe
i
take
it,
you
don't
contend
that
he
made
a
disclosure
that
he
had
accepted
the
money.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
take
it,
you're
pursuing
that
and
i
want
to
get
your
view
as
to
what
might
conceivably
be
the
important
issue
here,
i
take
it
but
your
position
is
that
corresponds
with
that
with
the
court
of
appeals,
the
fourth
circuit
that
is
to
say
that
the
count
and
evidence
relating
to
the
speech
and
so
infects
the
conviction,
that
it
cannot
stand
even
though
you
don't
challenge
the
indictment
on
the
basis
of
taking
money
for
purposes
of
inducing
the
congressman
to
make
a
representation
to
the
department
justice.
is
that
your
position?
