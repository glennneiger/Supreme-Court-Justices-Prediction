justice
john
m.
harlan
well
was
there
a
new
trial
on
the
other
phase
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
can
you
impugn
a
speech
more
by
saying
that
it
was
the
product
of
the
bribe?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
judges
aren't
surrounded
with
the
constitutional
protections?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
got
to
do
the
--
could
you
make
your
case
without
introducing
the
speech?
justice
john
m.
harlan
over
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
over
that
i
was
i
referring
to
the
fact
that
he
had
made
the
speech?
justice
john
m.
harlan
impugn
in
the
contents?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'll
come
back
to
my
other
question
it's
interesting
that
you
[voice
overlap]
speech
was
called
was
in
your
[inaudible]
impugn
the
veracity
of
it
that
they
have.
when
you
make
your
prior
good
[inaudible]
aren't
necessarily
drawing
in
question
the
good
faith
of
the
speech
in
the
public
–
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
to
that
to
the
show
that
money
was
handed
to
some
judge
to
make
the
decision
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
all
of
the
question
and
then
the
other
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
drawing
the
distinction
that
if
you
use
a
copy
of
the
speech
with
reference
to
the
clerk,
will
bring
it
to
the
congressional
record
that
that
might
have
defended
the
constitution
of
protection,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
find
if
anything
in
the
early
in
this
case
on
this
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
in
these
cases
that
view
bribery
of
members
of
the
parliament?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
judiciaries.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and,
a
voting
bribery
case,
should
it
make
any
difference
if
a
man
would
have
voted
the
way
he
did,
if
he
hadn't
accepted
the
bribe?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
wouldn't
the
same
--
so
far
as
that
principle
is
involved,
would
it
be
the
same
thing
so
far
as
the
speech
is
concerned.
no,
because
speech
has
a
more
fundamental
purpose
in
the
life
of
that
country.
speech
would
be
restrained,
it
will
be
curtailed,
and
it
would
be
inhibited
for
this
reason,
mr.
chief
justice,
no
one
would
dare
make
a
speech
that
could
be
interpreted
as
favoring
the
interest
of
a
contributor.
you
could
speak
against
his
interest
safely
and
freely,
but
how
could
you
dare
say,
“defend
the
position
of
your
contributors,
”
that's
where
you
retrain
and
curtail
freedom
of
speech.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
making
contributions
isn't
the
crime
here,
this
charge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
crime
here
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's'
something
else
but
i
mean
in
written
--
we're
talking
here
about
is
presumably
about
a
case
where
the
money
goes
into
the
congressman
and
the
senator's
pocket,
aren't
we?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
makes
a
crime
and
then
they
charge
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
jury
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
suggesting
that
if
you
did
not
have
a
free
speech,
would
they
–
justice
john
m.
harlan
congress
–-
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
will
mr.
doub,
and
you
may
have
an
extra
five
minutes
if
you
wish,
professor,
i
would
give
extra
five
minutes
to
mr.
rosenberg,
you
may
