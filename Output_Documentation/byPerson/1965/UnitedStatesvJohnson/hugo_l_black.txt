justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
under
what
statute
congress
has
made
it
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
if
the
court's
charge
to
the
jury
indicated
that
it's
finding
of
guilt
should
depend
in
any
of
those
ways
on
whether
the
congressman
believed
what
he
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
as
i
understood
it,
if
we're
to
say
that
the
government
you
say
ends
up
any
congressman
takes
the
money,
and
action
was
the
speech
he
made,
is
guilty
of
the
crime,
even
though
he
believed
it
wholeheartedly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
he
takes
money
to
make
the
speech,
maybe
he's
not
--
maybe
he
hadn't
intended
to
make
it
but
he
had
used
to
make
it,
says
i
believe
in
it
thoroughly
and
i
will
make
a
speech.
he
gives
him
the
money,
would
that
be
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
made
it
a
crime
to
accept
money
for
a
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
printed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
general
statute
so
we
can
go
into
that
influence
or
did
it
specifically
say
that
he
accepted
the
money
for
making
the
speech,
he'd
be
guilty
about
it--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
means
that
if
he
agrees
for
money,
knowingly
to
accept
that
money
for
the
purpose
of
doing
what
he's
going
to
do
in
bad
faith,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
bribed
in
to
vote
for
a
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
any
charge
here
that
he
did
not
honestly
believe
what
he
said,
that's
what
i'm
getting
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
you
are
saying
in
final
analysis
it
gets
to
that,
doesn't
it,
the
fact
assuming
that
he
made
it
in
the
probability
to
say
it.
but,
then
he
violated
the
law
was
making
the
speech,
for
which
he
took
money
but
you
have
to
have
the
speech
in
it
and
assume
that
best
thing
to
make
a
speech
in
favor
of
various
thoughts,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
then
you're
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
he
may
go
ahead
and
doing
what
would
be
their
duty
otherwise
to
make
the
speech
in
favor
of
something
they're
far.
you
say
if
they
get
some
money
for
it,
that's
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
you
have
to
draw
that
from
very
language.
i
should
think
that
that's
to
be
made
a
crime,
honestly,
to
make
the
speech
in
order
to
be
in
pretty
clear
language.
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes,
they
are
so
comprehensive
if
they
don't
have
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
i
would
have
to
vote,
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
constitutional
provision
that
permitted
judge
madden
to
say
what
he
say
--
said
to
that
at
that
time.
there
is
a
constitutional
provision
which
permits
the
congressman
to
make
the
speech
or
senator
and
it
can't
be
--
and
nothing
could
be
done
to
him
for
it?
you
can't
base
it
on
what
he
said
in
making
the
speech,
can
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet
it
was
the
same
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
essential
to
the
conviction
is
that
he
made
a
speech
in
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
frequently
people
is
not
essential?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
called
it
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
convicted
for
conclusion
of
the
fraud
generally
or
just
the
conspiracy
case,
defraud
the
government,
this
man.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
was
the
charge
against
the
other
--
others,
i
should
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
charge
against
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
tried
for
the
other
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
the
other
counts
have
noting
to
do
with
the
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
they
would
apparently
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
--
another
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hadn't
been
any,
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
think
about
[inaudible],
provided
that
it
should
be
a
crime
people
to
get
together
and
agree
among
themselves
to
urge
a
campaign,
to
do
everything
possible,
they
get
congressman
to
make
speeches
on
the
bill.
could
that's
be
permissible
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
would
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
they
have
said
that
they're
going
to
try
to
get
it
done
if
necessary.
they
had
paid
for
the
speech
as
[inaudible]
that
they're
going
to
do
extra
work,
what
about
the
right
to
petition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
but
bribe
means
many
different
things
you
can
give
a
word
of
that
conduct
of
bad
name.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
a
case
that
long
ago
of
noah
against
somebody
and
which
is
--
a
railroad,
they
tried
everywhere
in
the
world
to
get
enough
money
and
so
forth
to
keep
laws
from
being
passed
one
way
or
another
and
[inaudible]
promulgating
and
we
know
that
they
can
bring
their
turn
for
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
registering
is
quite
different
from
outlawing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
hire
people,
hire
people
to
go
and
lobby
with
the
congressman
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that's
been
get
up
for
fund,
i
think
i
have
heard
of
that
being
done,
they
get
into
the
corner,
they
help
the
congressman
or
a
senator
in
connection
with
his
campaigns
and
things
and
they
want
legislation
passed
and
they
go
to
them
and
asking
to
get
it
passed,
would
that
--
that
be
made
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
as
i
understand,
suppose
this
man
had
been
fighting
for
this
bill
a
long
time,
he's
[inaudible]
it's
been
his
bill
he
knows
and
to
people
who
also
thought
that
the
--
you
make
some
speeches
on
it.
he
says
“well
i
--
i
can't
spend
no
--”
and
they
say
“we'll
give
you
some
money
to
make
a
speech.”
you'd
say
that
that
could
be
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
know
his
problem
and
[inaudible]
i
am
going
to
do
everything
i
can
for
him,
they
want
to
stimulate
him
with
what
they
called
something
a
bonus
let's
say,
so
if
he
could
--
he
use
different
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
would
be
quite
a
different
statute
wouldn't
it,
if
it
said
that
no
congressman
to
accept
employment
the
minute
of
the
service
while
using
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
now
there's
a
difference
between
voting
and
making
speeches,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
constitution
says
something
about
making
speeches.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
the
congress
said
it
would
reference
to
a
man's
speech,
it
was
raised
by
the
different
question
with
me,
the
founders
have
said
that
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
they
have
to
a
particular
that
as
i
recall
it
they
went
up
to
a
lot
of
people
who
[inaudible]
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
that
can
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
think
action,
the
word
action
include?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
your
agreement
go
so
far
as
to
urge
that
congress
has
no
right
to
pass
a
law
forbidding
the
taking
of
money
for
making
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
quite
got
into
the
question
i
asked
you
some
time
ago.
do
you
contend
that
if
the
he
just
took
money
for
making
a
speech
that
the
congress
could
not
prohibit
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
couldn't
make
a
crime
for
--
