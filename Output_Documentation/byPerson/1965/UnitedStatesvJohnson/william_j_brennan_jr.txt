[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
was
it
introduced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
was
anything
that
was
said
in
the
speech
relied
on
by
the
government
to
support
the
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
at
any
time
in
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
--
to
what
issue
was
that
offer
of
proof
relevant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it
--
you've
emphasized
twice
that
they
made
a
difference
in
caption.
what
was
the
significance
of
that
on
--
has
bearing
on
the
issue
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
so
that
extends
at
least
the
government's
case
rested
on
the
speech,
at
least
the
caption
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
ms.
rosenberg,
on
the
government's
direct
case
i
take
that
the
defense
objected
though
the
evidence
about
the
speech,
on
the
government's
direct
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
objections
to
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
motion
for
acquittal
at
the
government's
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
that
rest
on
the
speech
and
debate
clause
in
the
part?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
government
makes
no
point
of
any
failure
to
object
to
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
rosenberg
suppose
that
a
congressman
get
up
and
[inaudible]
with
the
congress
says,
“i
want
all
of
you
to
know
that
i
am
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
i
believe
an
overthrow
of
this
government
by
force
and
violence.”
could
he
be
prosecuted
under
the
membership
clause
that
was
provided?
suppose
he
got
a
$1,000
for
making
that
statement?
