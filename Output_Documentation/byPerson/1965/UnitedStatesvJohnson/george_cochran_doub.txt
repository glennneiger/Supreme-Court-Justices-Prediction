mr.
george
cochran
doub
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
may
the
court
please.
before
discussing
how
the
executive
power
unluckily
violated
in
trespass
upon
the
legislative
liberty.
in
this
case,
i'm
here
to
explain
an
important
initial
issue
that
really
could
be
determinate
here.
the
government
did
not
charge
mr.
johnson
with
conspiring
to
violate
any
bribery
statute.
the
government
did
not
charge
him
with
conspiring
to
violate
any
conflict
of
interest
of
the
law.
it
didn't
charge
him
in
this
first
count
that's
conspiracy
charge
with
conspiring
to
violate
any
substantive
law
of
the
united
states.
thus,
section
205,
the
bribery
statute
which
the
government
talked
about
a
great
deal
was
never
involved
in
the
trial
of
this
case
and
was
never,
never
before
the
jury.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
wasn't
even
printed
in
a
brief
or
either
the
government
or
for
the
defendant.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
sir?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i'm
just
coming
to
that
later
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
bribery
statute
applies
by
its
terms
to
the
both---
mr.
george
cochran
doub
both
action
or
decision
i
supposed.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
would
say
no,
your
honor.
we
would
say
that
speech
and
debate
was
left
out
of
that
statute
and
could
only
be
interpreted
as
-–
in
it
was
specifically
mentioned
in
it.
and
also,
that
statute
only
applied
to
matters
both
decision
or
action
with
respect
to
matters
pending
in
the
congress.
in
this
case,
mr.
johnson's
speech
was
unrelated
to
any
matter
pending
in
the
congress.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
sir?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
it
could
include
actions
by
committees
of
the
congress,
appointments
to
committees,
rulings
by
the
presiding
officer.
all
those
things
could
be
action.
but
could
i
come
back
to
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
there
were
bills
pending.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
there's
never
been
an
reference
to
what
by
the
government
and
there's
never
–
i've
never
heard
of
any,
there
was
never
any
reference
in
the
trial
of
this
case
if
there's
---
there
was
never
any
claim
by
the
government,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
johnson
was
charged,
was
violating
an
1867
conspiracy
statute,
making
it
an
offense
to
conspire,
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
any
matter
that
was
section
371.
so,
the
initial
inquiry
here
is
whether
congress
in
adopting
that
conspiracy
statute
intended
that
it
should
cover
a
conspiracy
with
respect
to
a
speech
in
the
house
of
representative;
preparation,
source
material,
motivation,
its
causation
and
its
publication.
now,
this
conspiracy
statute
was
invalid
in
a
tax
bill
in
1867
is
considerable
evidence
that
it
was
designed
to
meet
much
publicized
tax
fraud
which
preceded
the
introduction
of
this
bill.
but
by
reason
of
its
general
language,
the
judiciary
quite
properly
held
that
it
should
apply
to
all
frauds
against
the
coin
of
contracts
of
the
property
of
the
united
states
because
it
said,
conspiring
to
the
fraud
the
united
states
in
any
manner.
and
that
valid
interpretation
is
reasonable
and
logical
and
it's
been
a
great
utility
to
the
government.
then
in
1910,
in
the
harris
case,
this
court
said,
well,
it
meant
more
than
that,
it
manifest
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
by
obstructing
the
efficiency
of
government
operations
and
then
in
1923,
in
the
opinion
by
chief
justice
taft
he
said,
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
means
primarily
cheating
the
government
out
of
its
property
or
money
but
secondarily,
as
obstructing
lawful,
governmental
functions
deceit,
dishonest
means
or
overreaching.
that
stretched
the
statute
for
our
behalf
beyond
anything
known
in
the
world
of
fraud
extract
it
into
the
area
of
ethics,
into
the
area
of
conflicts
of
interest.
because
now
the
-–
that
was
an
unparalleled
expansion
of
a
penal
statute.
the
obstruction
of
lawful,
governmental
functions
of
course
has
no
real
meaning;
no
meaning
at
all
is
a
conspiracy
to
obstruct
governmental
functions
by
spending
on
the
sidewalk
in
the
district
of
columbia.
is
it
conspiracy
to
obstruct
governmental
functions
to
agree
with
others
to
follow
the
war
in
vietnam.
this
thing
uses
the
word
dishonest
means
an
overreaching.
dishonest
means
an
overreaching
have
anymore
meaning
in
the
law
that's
simple
or
wicked
or
unethical.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
sir?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
i'm
leading
up
to
the
fact
that
assuming
that
you
accept
this
remarkable
interpretation
that
hasn't
been
defended
by
single
legal
scholar
in
the
country.
well,
assuming
if
this
court
does
say
that's
what
the
defrauding
means,
then
we
say
that
surely,
you
can
stretch
the
accordion
further
and
say
that
congress
intended
to
apply
it
to
an
alleged
venal
speech
in
the
congress.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
you
see
the
district
judge
instructed
this
jury
that
this
charge
meant
or
chief
justice
taft
said
it
in
hammerschmidt.
he
said
that
the
charge
of
violating
the
defrauding
portion
of
this
statute
meant
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
government
by
obstructing
governmental
functions
by
means
which
were
dishonest
or
overreaching
or
chicanery
and
other
appropriate
words.
so,
to
sustain
count
one,
the
initial
issue
is,
did
congress
in
enacting
that
conspiracy
statute
intended,
it
should
apply
to
a
conspiracy
with
respect
to
speech?
if
congress
vital
freedom
of
speech
and
debate
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
vague
and
imprecise,
all
inclusive
charge
under
a
general
1867
statute
originally
directed
at
frauds
against
the
government's
coin
and
property
and
even
probably
just
taxes.
now,
in
turn
you've
thought
us
otherwise,
there,
members
of
a
california
legislature
which
were
alleged
to
have
violated
a
civil
conspiracy
of
law
of
1871,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
law
is
more
explicit
far
more
than
this
vague
indefinite
catch
all
crime
that
mr.
johnson
was
charged
with
under
–-
and
you
held
the
basic
issue
was
whether
congress
in
enacting
that
statute
intended
to
include
within
its
coverage
official
acts
of
members
of
a
legislature
and
you
determine
that
congress
didn't
have
that
intention.
the
court
said
this,
did
congress
by
the
general
language
of
its
1871
statute
mean
to
overturn
the
tradition
of
legislative
freedom
achieved
in
england
by
civil
war
and
carefully
preserved
in
the
formation
of
state
and
national
governments
here?
did
it
mean
to
subject
legislatures
to
civil
liability
for
acts
done
within
the
sphere
of
legislative
activity?
we
can
not
believe
that
congress
is
still
(inaudible)
advocate
of
legislative
freedom
would
impinge
on
a
traditions
by
covered
inclusion
in
the
general
language
before
us.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
that
decision
was
based
on
the
fact
---
that's
right
on
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
and
in
other
words
along
article
i
section
6
prefers
to
relate
only
the
speech
and
debate
in
the
congress
the
court
deemed
this
tradition
of
legislative
freedom
of
such
paramount
importance
it
extended
of
all
the
official
acts
of
members
not
only
of
congress
but
in
this
case
of
a
state
legislature.
this
case
doesn't
relate
to
acts
of
the
state
legislature
and
our
case
doesn't
even
relate
to
official
acts
of
a
member
of
congress
unrelated
to
speech
and
debate.
this
case
relates
to
the
hardcore,
that
guts
of
the
speech
and
debate
provision,
utterances
on
the
floor
of
the
chamber
of
the
congress
and
then
motivation.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
think
it
would
be
a
disaster.
i
think
it
would
be
–
i
am
coming
to
that
but
may
i
just
finish
---
i'd
like
to
answer
that
in
a
moment.
in
eastern
railroad
conference
case
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
we
think
he
was
but
may
i
come
to
that
in
a
moment
just
let
me
finish
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
that's
in
the
conspiracy
charge.
he
collaborated
with
others
in
preparing
a
speech
and
then
he
was
compensated
for
making
the
speech,
through
the
hired
speech
and
that
he
cooperated
in
the
distribution
and
reprinting
of
that
speech.
all
the
things
we
say
are
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
but
may
i
just
point
out
that
in
the
eastern
railroad
conference
case
where
it
was
contended
the
antitrust
laws
applied
to
a
conspiracy
involving
dishonest
act,
unethical
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
to
elicit
anti-trucking
legislation.
and
there
you
said
you
would
not
assume
that
congress
intended
to
intrude
upon
this
political
area
unless
the
act
clearly
so
provides
and
this
act
doesn't
clearly
so
provide.
it
says
nothing
about
speech
and
debate.
i
say,
you
take
this
accordion
upon
which
the
government
can
play
almost
any
tune
on
it
under
chief
justice
taft's
interpretation.
but
you've
got
to
expound
it
and
stretch
it
the
way
beyond
that.
let's
say
that
the
congress
intended
to
bring
the
ethics
of
congressman
within
its
goals.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i'm
coming
to
that
in
a
moment
your
honor
but
may
i
just
conclude
with
this
then
i
will
deal
with
that.
i
say
that
congress
had
no
more
intention
to
apply
the
statute
to
hire
speech
in
the
congress
and
he
did
to
authorize
an
imposition
in
hearsay,
that's
my
first
point.
and
if
that's
right
then
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
is
unanimous
should
be
affirmed
that
this
was
an
invalid
count.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
my
first
point
is
then
that
this
conspiracy
statute,
section
371
mr.
johnson
was
charged
of
violating
---
was
charged
of
violating
any
bribery
statute
or
any
other
statute
conspiring
for
the
united
states
by
obstruction
its
government
functions
making
a
venal
speech
from
the
floor
of
the
house.
we
say
that
that
congress
never
intended
that
that
1867
statute
should
ever
be
applied
to
this
matter,
to
this
subject
matter.
that
should
entrench
upon
the
right
of
freedom
of
legislative
speech
are
effective.
now,
may
i
point
out
what
the
government
actually
questioned
in
this
case?
what
this
evidence
was?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
i'm
sorry
but
that's
very
definitely
my
position.
and
that
there
is
a
major
distinction
between
speech
and
utterance
in
the
congress
and
other
official
acts.
now,
whether
congress
can
pass
a
valid
bribery
statute
as
applied
to
a
vote
i
think
is
a
very
different
subject
--
it's
not
involved
in
this
case
but
i
think
somewhat
closer
subject.
and
the
reason
that
we
have
state
the
life
of
our
country
on
freedom
on
speech
that
there
can
be
no
inquiry
and
to
why
speech
is
made.
there
can
be
no
inquiry
as
to
what
purpose
it
serves.
the
reason
is
that
even
a
venal
speech,
even
a
speech
influenced
by
improper
motives
maybe
the
truth,
maybe
sound,
maybe
right
that's
why
we
can't
---
would
not
stop
coming
those
propaganda
in
this
country
just
because
its
motivation
maybe
evil.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
mr.
chief
justice,
there
have
been
no
widespread
scandals
of
venal
speeches
in
the
congress,
no
scholars
ever
advocated
the
great
speech
and
debate
clause
should
be
limited
and
restricted,
actually
more
crimes
had
been
committed
in
the
name
of
grudge.
two
dangerous
words
in
this
case,
and
i
think
they're
the
most
dangerous
in
our
legal
vocabulary.
one
is
conspiracy
and
the
other
is
bribe.
let
me
point
out
to
you
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i'm
just
coming
to
it.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
am
here
now
--.
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
at
a
scene
agreement
that
was
charged
in
this
indictment
was
an
alleged
agreement
by
johnson
to
make
a
speech
in
the
house,
now,
it
didn't
stop
there.
it
was
to
make
a
speech
in
the
house
defending
maryland
state
savings
and
loans
associations.
now,
we
say
this
charge
required
an
inquiry
into
the
content
of
the
speech.
under
that
charge
it
was
absolutely
essential
for
the
government
to
show
that
mr.
johnson
speech,
what
the
speech
on
foreign
policy,
it
wasn't
a
speech
attacking
the
savings
and
loans
associations.
it
was
a
speech
supporting.
because
if
the
substance
of
the
speech
had
been
of
a
different
character
its
content
would
have
denied
the
charge.
in
other
words,
the
government
in
this
case
had
to
show
content
of
the
speech
to
establish
the
offense
and
so
it
put
the
speech
in
evidence
and
it
didn't
put
it
in
to
any
restricted
purpose
or
a
limited
purpose,
it
just
put
it
in.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
is
by
what
tribunal
should
it
be
punished
by?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
mean,
of
course,
he
should
be
punished
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
three
law
review
articles
have
been
published
–-
three
law
review
articles
have
been
published
approving
the
fourth
circuit
decision.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
you've
got
–-
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
mr.
chief
justice
but
you
have
to
look
to
the
great
constitutional
history
involved
here
it's
never
been
a
question
of
whether
a
congressman
should
be
punished
for
any
penal
act,
of
course
he
should.
in
the
case
of
speech
and
debate
though
our
constitution
reserves
that
area
with
discipline
to
each
chamber
of
the
congress
and
each
chamber
can
discipline
and
should.
as
a
matter
of
fact
you'll
find
the
house
of
the
congress
considered
as
an
insult
to
the
house
for
anyone
to,
for
any
member
to
accept
a
bribe
for
any
official
act
he
did.
and
even
back
in
the
17th
and
18th
centuries
there
are
numerable
such
cases
where
they
acted
on
such
charges
against
members.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
those
charges
were
--
the
charge
was
the
violation
of
a
conflict
of
interest
statute
which
forbid
a
member
of
congress
from
accepting
compensation
for
rendering
services
before
an
executive
agency
of
the
government.
we
never
questioned
that,
the
charge
was
right
within
the
statute.
the
whole
factual
issue
there
was
this,
when
mr.
johnson
after
being
told
that
this
charge
against
mr.
edlin
and
first
colony
was
outrageous
have
been
inspired
by
competitors
was
unjust
and
it
was
undisputed,
he'd
been
told
that.
it
was
undisputed
that
he
went
to
the
–
and
saw
the
attorney
general
and
told
him
that.
it
was
undisputed
also
that
he
told
him
he
didn't
wish
to
interfere
at
all
and
all
he
was
asking
was
to
reveal
the
case
on
the
merits.
and
he
then
had
other
meetings
with
the
head
of
the
criminal
division
on
the
same
subject
and
mr.
miller
said
yes,
mr.
johnson
told
him
that.
now,
the
issue
is
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
suggest
mr.
fortas,
the
whole
issue
was,
was
he
paid
for
those
services.
it
was
our
contention,
he
wasn't
paid
a
cent,
it
was
our
contention
that
his
legal
fee
-–
the
sums
of
money
which
he
received
in
1961
from
march
on
were
all
legal
fees
from
several
land
companies
and
from
several
savings
and
loan
associations
that
he
represented
for
legal
work
done.
we
didn't
rest
on
merely
his
own
testimony
as
to
his
legal
services
for
them
and
mr.
robinson
but
we
brought
in
six
lawyers,
one
from
new
york,
one
from
washington,
one
from
baltimore,
one
from
southern
maryland
but
generally
all
of
them
to
testify
the
certain
aspects
of
his
legal
work.
so
the
real
issue
under
the
substantive
counts
was,
did
those
payment
or
those
fees
include
payment
for
going
to
–-
making
those
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
our
position
here
is
that
this
unlawful
first
count
and
the
evidence
submitted
under
it
violated
and
did
infect
the
jury's
verdict
under
the
substantive
counts,
it
was
hardly
contested
whether
he
was
paid
for
his
trips
to
the
department
and
we
say
that
no
one
could
say
with
assurance
that
the
jury
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
unlawful
charges
as
to
the
speech
in
the
conspiracy
count.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
the
government
reserved
that
issue,
they
never
contested
it
in
their
brief
here.
may
i
say
this
about
this
or
about
the
evidence?
the
alleged
bribe
of
$500.00
to
make
a
speech
after
johnson
had
been
defeated
for
reelection
three
weeks
after
the
indictment
by
the
republican
opponent.
but
when
he
got
to
trial,
the
$500.00
bribe
became
a
political
campaign
gift.
it
wasn't
paid
under
the
table.
it
wasn't
paid
in
cash.
it
was
paid
by
check
with
a
covering
letter
and
it
was
endorsed
by
johnson
over
to
his
treasurer
and
he
deposited
it
in
his
bank
account
with
other
contributions
and
he
reported
it
to
the
circuit
court
along
with
all
other
contributions,
so
it
was
received,
recorded,
used
and
reported
as
in
the
case
of
other
contributions
and
it
was
used
to
help
elect
john
f.
kennedy
and
lyndon
johnson
and
congressman
johnson,
like
all
the
others.
i'm
not
going
to
go
to
into
the
evidence
about
this
speech,
except
to
say
there
wasn't
any
evidence
that
johnson
ever
agreed
to
make
a
speech
for
that
small
campaign
contribution.
there
wasn't
any
-–
and
i
don't
believe
when
you
look
at
this
record
you
can
say
that
he
did.
but
we
contend
-–
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
was
the
only
money
he
received
anywhere
around
this
time
of
this
speech.
now
the
–-
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
your
honor,
the
government
never
even
contended
he
received
any
money
except
this
$500.00
for
the
speech.
there
were
two
checks
paid
to
his
office
that
he
endorsed
over
to
the
public
printer
for
the
ordering
reprints
of
the
speech
within
the
next
30
days.
then
there
was
a
retainer
paid
to
him
in
the
fall,
i
think
it
was
about
september
1st,
of
$1,000.00
when
he
was
engaged
to
represent,
act
as
local
council
for
robinson,
who
is
general
council
of
a
mortgage
company
in
florida
and
to
savings
and
loan
associations.
that
was
all
for
1960.
the
speech
is
made
in
june
16.
now
in
‘61,
he
received
-–
he
did
a
lot
of
legal,
he
received
a
lot
of
checks
-–
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
say
they
totaled,
i
think
about
$19,000.00.
out
of
those
checks
he
paid
local
council
in
virginia
and
in
southern
maryland
about
$6,000.00,
a
local
council
in
baltimore
$1,000.
he
had
the
responsibility
of
foreclosing
a
15
million-dollar
mortgage.
but
the
speech
itself
was
related
to
a
subject
of
major
interest
to
the
state
of
maryland.
it
didn't
relate
to
an
idaho
power
dam
that
mr.
johnson
couldn't
have
any
possible
interest
in.
you
will
find
it's
an
able
speech,
an
intelligent
speech
and
it's
a
good
speech
and
it
was
one
that
any
maryland
congressman
would
logically
make
after
the
–-
in
his
paper
article
calling
all
maryland
savings
and
loan
associations
(inaudible).
i
think,
the
essential
issue
here,
the
court
please
is
whether
the
speech
and
debate
clause
prohibits
an
inquiry
only
into
what
it
said
in
the
congress
as
the
government
contends.
but
whether
it
prohibits
an
inquiry
into
why
it
was
said.
as
we
contend
and
the
fourth
circuit
held
and
we
say
that
the
making
of
any
speech
involves
a
speech
process
and
that
certainly
includes
its
purpose
of
thinking
behind
it,
its
preparation,
its
motivation,
source
material,
and
its
use.
all
should
be
within
the
clause
and
this
nearly
raised
the
antecedent
agreement
to
make
a
speech.
we
say
that's
an
integral
part
of
the
speech
process
and
we
say
to
deny
this
is
just
to
emasculate
and
destroy
the
constitution.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
the
congress
could
act
on
it
itself
in
discipline
and
then
–-
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
this
is
consistent
with
the
great
dramatic
legislative
history
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
prohibiting
anyone
from
questioning
speech
and
debate
and
then
its
-–
your
honor,
you've
already
said
and
told
us
that
claim
of
unworthy
purpose
would
not
destroy
the
privilege.
you've
even
said
dishonest
official
act.
so
that's
what
you
said
intending
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
say
no,
i
say
no.
i
say
that
would
be
in
the
same
category
as
if
a
congressman
was
charged
with
not
speaking,
being
paid
not
to
speak
against
a
bill
or
for
a
bill
and
being
silent,
silence
was
just
as
eloquent
with
the
speech.
so
i
say
both
categories,
you'd
be
questioning
a
motivation
of
speech
–
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
i
wouldn't.
that
would
be
the
receipt
of
income
–-
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
would
be
the
receipt
of
income
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
there's
a
difference
there.
i
think
–-
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
of
course
it's
a
hypothetical
question
case.
what
you
present
and
the
chief
justice
presents
are
very
different
from
the
case,
we
have
here.
i'm
just
speculating
about
it.
i
would
say
that
in
the
case
of
–-
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
if
that
occurred
then
it
would
still
be
in
my
position.
it
couldn't
be
done.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
actually,
in
the
case,
chief
justice-
–
it's
hard
to
conceive
and
visualize
the
case
you
mentioned.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
300
years
there's
never
been
such
a
charge
as
this.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
history
and
it's
the
most
dramatic
history
of
any
constitutional
provision
we
have
and
the
best
documented
and
the
most
colorful.
it
shows
there
was
no
distinction
between
content
and
motivation.
it
shows
that
this
new
found
effort
of
the
government
to
say
that
there's
a
–-
that
the
constitutional
provision
was
only
designed
to
protect
the
substance,
the
content
of
speech.
we
say
that
that's
denied
by
the
history
because
the
most
famous
case
in
england
didn't
even
relate
to
content.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
never
by
the
judiciary.
there
are
plenty
of
cases
and
–-
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
your
honor.
the
crowd
has
never
brought
such
a
charge.
and
we
have
pulled
together
more
comprehensively
and
we
think
for
the
first
time
in
whole
history
of
this
and
we
believe
you'll
find
that
everything
that
peter
wentworth
said
and
elliot
said
and
other
great
parliamentarians
and
everything
we
say
that
the
house
of
commons
said
in
its
(inaudible)
deny
this
distinction
between
content
and
purpose.
the
most
significant
case
is
a
case
form
the
16th
century,
where
the
crown
charged
a
member
of
commons,
with
introducing
a
bill
to
regulate
the
tin
industry
and
he
was
charged
with
having
a
financial
interest
in
the
bill.
the
content
wasn't
involved.
he
was
convicted.
the
house
of
commons
attempted
to
annul
that
conviction
indeed
and
they
also
at
the
same
time
said
that
they
were
-–
these
charges
were
invalid.
the
judges
--
and
from
that
time
on,
the
parliamentarians
contended
that
this
(inaudible)
act
was
a
general
act
applicable
to
all
members
of
congress,
all
members
of
the
house
of
commons
and
applicable
to
--
and
denying
the
crown
any
authority
to
make
any
charge
of
any
kind
whether
inquiring
into
their
acts
in
their
chamber.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
outside
of
the
field
of
speech
and
debate,
and
i'm
clear
as
to
that
that
they
can't
do
that.
but
outside
of
that,
when
you
deal
with
official
acts
other
than
that,
i
think
when
that
case
is
presented
to
you,
which
it
isn't
here
today,
the
issue
will
be,
could
congress
delegate
or
consent
or
wave
the
privilege?
and
did
it
do
so
by
the
enactment
of
such
a
statute?
that
would
be
the
real
issue.
now,
ordinarily
when
the
constitution
has
conferred
the
power
upon
the
congress,
congress
may
delegate
that
power
to
the
executive
or
even
to
the
state,
as
in
the
case
of
the
commerce
power.
but
you
have
a
more
difficult
problem
here
because
the
speech
and
debate
clause
is
not
cast
in
terms
of
granting
a
power
to
congress.
it
says
speech
and
debate
shall
not
be
questioned
elsewhere.
so
it's
a
denial,
prohibition
of
power
in
the
executives
and
the
judiciary.
so
when
you
–
if
and
when
you
reach
that
question,
that
will
be
a
great
question.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
this
charge
is
absolutely
violating
from
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
this
conspiracy
charge.
it
resulted
as
elaborate
into
mr.
johnson's
mental
processes,
was
he
influenced
by
the
campaign
contribution
or
not.
why
in
the
fourth
circuit
the
government's
brief
said,
surely
the
government
did
not
have
to
prove
that
johnson's
soul
motive
–-
that
johnson's
soul
motive
was
the
campaign
contribution
or
to
aid
edler
(ph)
and
robinson.
i
thought
in
the
outset
that
this
violated
the
clause
and
i
think
so
still.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
publication,
the
allegations
that
he
ordered
reprints
of
his
speech
and
was
interested
in
their
distribution.
that
was
a
violation
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
you
remember
it
wrongly,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
black.
the
other
judges
didn't
reach
the
point
to
held
that
there
could
be
no
inquiry
in
the
distribution
of
books.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i'm
not
sure,
i
followed
you
but
i
think
i
would
your
honor
–
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
it
certainly
-–
i
don't
think
the
court
and
the
executive
could
go
into
that
speech.
assuming
that
you
hereafter
hold
in
a
case
when
the
question
comes
before
you,
that
the
congress
can
enact
an
anti-bribery
statute
applicable
to
official
acts,
other
than
speech
and
debate
and
assuming
there's
a
prosecution
under
that,
i
would
still
say
the
government
could
put
an
evidence
of
speech
he
made,
even
though
it
was
related
to
it.
may
i
point
this
out?
members
of
congress,
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people,
they
necessarily
accept
and
rely
on
in
their
political
campaigns,
upon
campaign
contributions.
in
the
case
of
a
member
of
congress,
he
represents
the
farm
interests,
his
contributions
will
come
from
the
farm
organizations.
if
he
is
a
chap
in
civil
rights,
his
contributions
will
probably
come
from
associations
interested
in
civil
rights.
if
he
is
a
champion
of
labor,
they
will
come
from
the
labor
unions.
now,
the
power
of
the
executive
was
such
that
a
member
of
congress
in
his
legislative
utterances,
favoring
or
deemed
the
favor
of
special
interest
groups
to
contribute
to
his
political
campaigns.
but
he
was
influenced
by
those
campaign
contributions
or
he
may
not
have
seen
an
agreement
with
his
contributors
to
make
a
speech
in
the
congress.
i
say
that
would
be
highly
dangerous.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
question
about
that
–-
mr.
george
cochran
doub
with
all
the
covering
letters
said
it
was
--
it
wasn't
-–
it
didn't
come
under
the
table,
it
wasn't
in
cash,
it
was
openly
made.
johnson
didn't
get
cent
of
it.
personally,
he
endorsed
it
over
to
his
treasurer
and
it
was
deposited
–
treated
just
as
all
the
other
contributions
were
to
his
campaign
–-
but
coming
back
to
this,
i
say
this
charge
alone
that
someone
spoke
in
favor
of
the
interest
of
someone
who
had
contributed
to
--
who
had
been
a
contributor
in
his
campaign.
a
charge
could
be
politically
destructive
as
it
was
with
johnson.
in
spite
of
his
presumption
of
innocence,
he
was
defeated.
at
the
trial,
a
speech
is
conceded;
a
political
campaign
is
conceded,
so
then,
it's
necessary
for
the
member
of
congress
in
his
defense
to
explain
his
mental
processes,
his
bona
fide
purposes,
his
inner
most
thoughts,
and
to
demonstrate
that
he
would
have
said
the
same
thing
regardless
of
the
campaign
contribution.
and,
i
say
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
but
that's
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
what
the
evidence
showed
it
was
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
that
was
--
yes,
so
we
have
motions
for
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i'd
say
again
that
there
is
this
distinction
between
voting
and
other
official
acts
and
speech.
i'd
say,
we
have
staked
the
life
of
this
nation
on
the
capacity
of
free
speech
to
develop
truth
and
to
enable
truth
to
gain
acceptance
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
and
if
that's
true
for
the
ordinary
citizen,
surely
it
might
--
cannot
possibly
be
less
true
for
members
of
congress,
and
whatever
your
ruling
maybe
in
some
future
case
on
a
venal
vote
in
the
congress
that
issue
is
presented
which
it
is
not
here,
we
submit
that
the
basic
uninhibited,
free
speech
principles
mean
that
it
cannot
be
curtailed
because
of
a
charge
that
it
was
hired
or
influenced
by
a
political
campaign
contribution
or
any
other
unethical
consideration.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
have
serious
doubt,
whether
onto
the
first
amendment,
a
criminal
charge
could
ever
be
made
against
the
editor
of
a
newspaper
or
any
other
publisher
that
involved
in
inquiry
into
his
motives
and
whether
they
were
honest
or
not
in
anything
but
that
that
publisher
said.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
there.
i
think
it
could
be
--
i
think
it
could
be,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
where
you
have
on
the
one
hand
a
general
first
amendment
right
and
on
the
other
you
have
a
specific,
unqualified
category
clause
in
the
constitution
dealing
with
speech
and
debate
in
the
congress,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
would
naturally
look
to
the
--
and
interpret
the
specific
provision
rather
than
the
general
one.
but
even
a
hired
speech,
even
a
speech
influenced
by
a
campaign
contribution
or
desire
to
aid
private
interest,
the
speech
maybe
right,
it
maybe
convincing,
and
it
maybe
conducive
to
truth
on
its
merits.
it
maybe
true
and
that's
why
you
can't
permit
any
inquiry
into
it.
if
i
have
any
time
left,
would
mr.
chief
justice,
you
permit
my
--
professor
louisell
to
use
us
that
time?
i'd
be
very
grateful.
