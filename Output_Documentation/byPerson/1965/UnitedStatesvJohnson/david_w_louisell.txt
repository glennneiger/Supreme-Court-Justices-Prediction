mr.
david
w.
louisell
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
things
that
has
mystified
me
since
the
argument
here
on
wednesday
is
how,
by
the
use
of
words,
the
impression
can
be
conveyed
to
whatever
the
verbal
formula
that
this
prosecution
didn't
involve
a
penetrating
inquiry
into
everything
we
need,
when
we
talk
about
speech.
the
psychological,
the
moral,
the
human
characteristics
that
go
into
making
a
speech,
the
involving
as
it
does,
the
research,
the
preparation,
the
thinking,
the
balancing
of
interest,
will
i
talk
or
won't
i
talk
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
culminating
finally
in
the
speech.
this
court,
which
has
never
been
fooled
at
least
in
recent
years
by
a
mere
terminology
or
evidence,
as
you
pointed
out
in
the
new
york
times
case,
we
penetrate
to
the
realities
and
we're
not
satisfied
by
state
characterization
as
a
libel
or
treason
or
sudden
some
such
thing.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
when
it
comes
to
voting,
your
honor,
note
how
specifically,
first
of
all,
the
words
of
the
constitution
are
–-
mr.
david
w.
louisell
for
any
speech
or
debate
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
to
a
degree,
your
honor,
exactly
states
the
situation.
many
of
the
same
type
of
considerations
are
pertinent.
but
notice
the
difference.
notice
that
the
function
of
speech,
your
honor,
is
to
influence,
to
urge,
to
advocate,
and
notice
that
a
speech
may
do
that
and
they
do
so
properly.
and,
i
think
the
reading
of
the
text
of
this
speech
in
the
appendix
will
show
you
what
an
appeal,
it
was
to
common
sense
and
judgment.
a
speech
is
aimed
at
convincing
and
that
is
why
the
constitution
draws
such
a
sharp
dichotomy.
that
is
why
the
constitution
is
willing
to
create
an
absolute
barrier
for
any
speech
or
debate,
he
shall
not
be
held
responsible
in
any
other
place
and
notice
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
but
most
people
may
prefer,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
seem
to
go
the
heart
of
the
matter
because
it
gives
to
speech
and
debate,
that
the
english
tradition
of
400,
500
years
has
been
devoted.
it
is
to
the
absolute
guarantee
of
speech
and
debate
that
our
constitution
is
so
absolutely
committed.
now,
your
honor,
i
asked
the
question,
would
the
bribery
statute
necessarily
call
by
a
condemnation
of
what
the
government
attempted
to
do
here?
then
although
it's
already
been
aptly
pointed
out
that
the
bribery
statute
isn't
involved
here,
it
is
the
penetrating
question
that
forces
an
analysis
and
that
is
why,
i
maintain,
it
so
important
to
study
the
history
of
the
speech
and
debate,
to
the
english
years
and
to
the
civil
war
period
and
into
our
constitution.
and
i
maintain,
it's
very
important
to
realize,
particularly
on
congressional
intent,
congress
has
never
tried
to
reach
a
prohibition
for
judicial
purposes
that
is
for
prosecution
purposes.
on
speech
or
debate,
it's
never
made
the
attempt.
it
has
made
the
attempt
to
prohibit
the
bribery
of
a
vote.
it
has
made
that
attempt
and
incidentally,
i
can
find
no
instance
in
american
history
where
there
has
even
been
a
prosecution
for
the
vote.
that
alone
for
speech
and
debate,
i
had
wanted
to
mention
to
the
court
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
pardon.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
no,
it
doesn't
mean
there
shouldn't
have
been,
your
honor,
but
what
it
means
to
me
is
this,
that
through
most
of
--
to
all
of
american
history
up
to
this
prosecution,
the
executive
and
the
judiciary
have
been
willing
to
abide
the
constitutional
judgment,
that
the
inappropriate
place
to
penalize
this
sort
of
conduct
that
is
alleged
in
this
case
is
in
the
chamber,
and
we
all
know
how
effective
a
disciplinary
action
by
a
chamber
of
congress
can
be
in
curtailing
improprieties.
that's
the
judgment
of
the
constitution
and
if
it's
read
against
the
background
of
the
english
history,
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
other
judgment
than
that
of
the
fourth
circuit
reached.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
that
conclusion,
to
uphold
the
fourth
circuit.
by
no
means,
it
is
perfectly
possible.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
you
follow
the
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion,
and
it
maybe
an
excellent
illustration
that
a
page
of
history
is
worth
a
volume
of
logic.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
even
if
you
follow
to
its
logical
conclusion,
your
honor,
and
a
perfectly
driving
type
of
penetrating
inquiry
to
make,
i'd
still
say
no.
i'd
still
say
it's
possible
for
congress
to
condemn
the
bribery
of
a
vote,
but
absolutely
--
by
means
of
a
judicial
prosecution,
but
it's
absolutely
impossible
to
make
an
inquiry
into
the
motive
of
speech
that
is
tuned
over
to
the
executive
and
the
judiciary.
if,
your
honor,
is
that
maybe,
perhaps,
the
defect
of
the
brief
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
this
is
just
burying
the
question
of
motive
and
basis
for
the
speech,
mr.
justice
douglas,
under
the
mere
phraseology,
if
the
government
comes
up
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
with
have
seen
incumbent.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
no,
i
don't
think
it's
burying
to
inquire,
what
are
the
psychological
realities
of
the
speech-making
process?
and
to
me,
it
came
that
you
can
have
a
prosecution
of
this
kind
in
respect
of
everything
other
than
the
mere
delivery
of
the
speech
is
highly
artificial
to
me.
not
always
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
the
proof
of
the
effect
of
anything
prior
to
the
speech,
the
$5,
000
or
the
$10,000.00
when
it's
an
integral
part,
how
do
you
prove
that
the
speech
was
the
consequence
of
it?
mr.
david
w.
louisell
your
honor,
that
has
to
be
very
precisely
analyzed
to
course
of
a
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
a
congressman
gets
$10,000.00,
he's
obliged
to
report
that
as
income
--
if
it's
income.
of
course,
he's
obliged
to
report
it.
could
he
be
prosecuted
for
receiving?
can
he
escape
the
fact
that
it's
income?
there's
no
problem
there.
he's
got
to
report
the
income.
if
he's
prosecuted
for
evading
it
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
he's
prosecuted
for
evading
it,
your
honor,
there's
no
inhibition
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
except
that
the
use
of
the
contents
of
a
speech,
the
use
of
the
speech
itself
could
not
be
an
item
of
evidence
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
if
your
honors
will
carefully
note
how
many
instances
the
government
depended
on
the
contents
of
the
speech,
and
i
sat
here
in
amazement,
when
i
heard
innuendo
to
the
contrary
during
the
prosecution
of
this
case,
as
we
point
out
first
of
all
on
page
28
of
the
brief,
note
the
words
of
the
fourth
circuit.
after
their
careful
analysis,
the
speech
was
more
than
an
incidental
feature
of
the
conspiracy
charge.
only
one
half
of
the
testimony
introduced
at
the
trial
related
to
the
speech.
notice
what
we
point
out
about
the
nature
of
the
indictment.
by
quoting
from
the
indictment,
on
pages
29
and
30,
how
many
of
the
overt
acts
were
directly
tied
up
with
the
speech
making
process,
the
delivery
of
the
speech.
notice
that
the
fourth
overt
act
in
this
indictment
that
we
set
forth
on
page
47
and
48.
the
very
thing
the
government
relied
upon,
your
honor,
the
fourth
overt
act
that
on
or
about
june
30th,
1960
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
defendant
johnson
delivered
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives.
notice
what
the
trial
judge
charged
as
we
set
forth
on
page
68
of
the
brief
that,
“two
separate
conspiracies”.
the
first,
beginning
on
april
1,
1960,
to
defraud
the
united
states
of
its
governmental
functions
largely
by
the
making
of
the
speech
by
defendant
johnson
and
distributions
of
reprints
thereof.
how
much
more
connection
can
you
have
between
the
facts
which
a
normal
human
psychology
precede
the
making
of
the
speech
and
the
contents
of
the
speech
itself.
i
think
it's
almost
demonstrable
to
an
almost
a
certainty
that
the
very
contents
of
the
speech,
where
the
heart
of
this
prosecution,
and
notice
in
the
most
famous
case
in
this
connection
that
your
honors
can
read,
the
strode
case,
it
didn't
involve
the
contents
of
the
speech
at
all.
it
involved
the
alleged
corrupt
interest
of
a
member
of
parliament
in
having
a
private
interest
in
the
bill
that
he
introduced
in
parliament.
then
after
generations
of
struggle
in
england,
the
act
that
condemned
the
interference
of
the
judiciary
with
parliamentary
freedom
there
was
made
a
permanent
part
of
english
constitutional
history.
let's
not
--
this
court
has
with
penetrating
realization
of
a
necessity
of
protecting
constitutional
grants.
this
court
has
gone
to
the
realities
over
and
over
again
in
the
free
speech
area
against
the
most
emotional
charges,
against
the
claims
of
libel
and
slander
and
even
of
treason.
we
penetrate
to
the
realities.
let's
not
feel
that's
the
word
bribery,
even
though
it
can
be
uttered
with
the
most
base
innuendoes.
let
us
not
permit
that
to
hide
the
realities
from
us
in
this
case.
let's
remember
we
have
a
constitutional
provision
here
that
is
as
specific,
as
definite,
as
well
founded
in
english
tradition
as
any
words
that
you
can
pick
out
of
the
constitution.
and,
lastly,
let
us
never
forget
that
there
is
something
terribly
sacred,
significant,
and
basic
in
all
provisions
about
speech,
that
it
can
be
distinguished,
that
congress
has
distinguished
it
by
its
own
willingness
to
limit
its
condemnation
to
the
three
words
of
action,
vote
or
decision
but
never
has
indicated
any
waiver,
any
desire
or
willingness
to
waive
what
the
constitution
makes
sacred,
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
i
thank
you.
