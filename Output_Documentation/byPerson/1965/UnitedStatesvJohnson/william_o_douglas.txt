the
statute
shows
action
or
voting?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
it
would
-–
that
would
have
been
broad
enough
to
include
these
acts?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
that
have
been
broad
enough
to
include
these
acts?
i'm
not
asking
you
to
pressure
yourself
on
that
point
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
action
too
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
said
conversing
and
speaking
is
a
form
of
action.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
maybe
an
interview.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
mr.
doub,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
no
action
of
any
kind
of
pending
–-
was
there
no
investigation
of
savings
and
loan
associations
before
the
congress
at
that
time?
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
i
didn't
asked
if
there
were
any
bills
pending
i
asked
if
there's
any
investigation
or
any
companies
interested
in
those
sense?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
am
just
asking,
i
have
no
information
on
the
side.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
conclusion,
you
maybe
right
but
would
you
mind
illuminating
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
before
you
get
to
that,
i
would
like
to
know,
i
would
like
to
know
what
is
your
position
that
congress
has
no
right
to
pass
any
law
prohibiting
a
congressman
from
taking
money
for
making
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
advocating
anything--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
all
i
want
to
know
from
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we've
also
just
take
their
lives
on
honesty
of
public
officials
in
the
office,
have
we
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
haven't
yet
been
able
to
see
how
if
we
sustain
a
part
from
the
other
points.
if
we
sustain
this
conviction
how
this
would
run
against
the
spirit
of
the
immunity
from
free
debate?
it's
up
on
my
head
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
are
always
just
coming
to
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
doub,
you
mentioned
that
there's
no
--
no
scholars
have
ever
advanced
this
idea,
has
it
ever
been
seriously
discussed
in
stoller
v.
(inaudible)
prior
to
despair,
rather
the
congressman
has
the
right
to
accept
money
to
make
the
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
congress.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn't
you
ask
you
that,
i
asked
you
if
the
precise
question
that
you
present
here
has
been
seriously
discussed
in
stoller
v.
(inaudible),
because
you
haven't
brought
in
your
statement
--
and
ever
advocated
such
a
thing
and
i
just
wondered
if
that
subject
had
been
seriously
discussed
or
---
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
i
was
thinking
about
before
this
thing
–-
this
matter—
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
that
the
only
money
he
received,
$500.00?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
much
or
told
did
they
prove
he
took?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
suppose
we
had
a
very
simple
statement
of
facts
here
and
if
we're
not
to
contest
it
and
all
the
facts
that
we
had
were
that
congressman
a
had
agreed
with
certain
interest
that
when
he
would
make
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
congress,
for
thousands
of
dollars
and
he
was
paid
that
money
for
that
purpose
and
he
was
arrested
thereafter
--
before
let's
say
his
speech
was
made.
would
the
congress
have
the
authority
to
proscribe
such
conduct?
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
that
this
was
a
tax
case
and
he
was
being
sued
because
he
didn't
report
this.
suppose
he
was
charged
of
having
received
$10,000.00
or
whatever
it
was
in
that
speech
in
the
congress
and
the
internal
revenue
sues
him,
that
would
be
inquiring
about
your
theory
into
the
speech
i
suppose
–-
justice
william
o.
douglas
beg
your
pardon.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
what
this
case
is
about,
receipt
of
income.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
there
is
a
difference,
i
just
wonder
whether
it
is
a
material
difference.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
considered
that
they
have
to
introduce
the
speech,
they
have
to
show
that
the
speech
that
was
made
and
the
funds
that
were
paid
and
the
speech
therefore
would
be
in
the
record
just
like
in
your
case
and
therefore
the
speech
would
be
an
under-challenge
and
inquiry
by
your
standard?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
whatever
the
tax
immunity
case
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
your
argument
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
has
no
right
to
make
bribery
of
a
congressman,
a
crime?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
would
your
argument
leave
us
to
conclude,
do
you
think?
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
we
wanted
to
include
that
the
time
in
this
case
we
spoke
out
that
the
congress
could
pass
an
act
making
bribery
a
crime
and
suppose
the
congressman
was
arrested
for
accepting
a
bribe
and
it
developed
in
addition
from
voting,
and
developed
that
in
addition
to
voting
he
had
made
a
speech
urging
other
congressmen
to
vote
as
he
did.
would
that
immunize
him?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
a
very
simple
thing.
if
congressman
a
takes
that
bribe
form
mr.
b
to
vote
for
and
urge,
passage
of
a
bill.
he
accepts
the
money
for
it.
then
in
pursuance
of
that,
he
not
only
votes
for
the
bill,
but
he
makes
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
urging
other
congressmen
to
vote
for
it
as
a
part
of
the
bribe.
would
that
–
the
fact
that
he
made
the
speech
immunize
against
the
charge
of
bribery?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
must
we
assume
that
this
money
came
to
congressman
johnson
as
a
campaign
contribution?
i
assume
that
you
–-
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
sure
the
jury
didn't
believe
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
would
be
true
if
--
our
question
is
what
is
the
motive?
but,
the
question
here
is
did
he
get
a
$1,000.00?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
bury
it
by
saying
this
isn't
the
realm
of
motive?
justice
william
o.
douglas
nobody's
saying
that.
all
they're
saying
is
can
you
--
can
you
prove
the
he
got
a
thousand
or
ten
thousand
or
what
not
for
making
a
speech?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you
would
agree
with
mr.
doub
then,
that
this
was
an
income
tax
case.
you
couldn't
–-
to
get
a
deficiency
assessment
because
you
get
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
has
to
be
precisely
analyzed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
sure
would
slow
down
in
making
speeches
for
money.
