ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
in
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
to
reveal
its
judgment,
reversing
on
the
conviction
respondent
for
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states.
the
charges
against
respondent
which
the
jury
and
for
that
matter
the
court
of
appeals
found
established
by
the
evidence,
were
that
he
used,
that
he
took
money
to
use
his
position
as
a
congressman
in
the
interest
to
co-defendants
represented
so
called
independent
maryland
savings
and
loan
association,
first
to
make
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
congress
and
then
to
use
his
congressional
influence
to
bear
on
the
department
of
justice
to
get
it,
to
dismiss
an
indictment
against
his
co-defendant
and
one
of
its
companies,
first
calling.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
solely
because
it
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
provide
where
the
prosecution
of
a
congressman
for
taking
money
to
make
its
speech
on
the
floor
of
congress.
it
reversed
the
conviction
on
substantive
counts,
which
did
not
involve
the
speech
at
all
but
only
the
representations
to
the
department
of
justice,
only
because
it
felt
that
the
evidence
we
laid
into
the
speech
part
of
the
conspiracy
might
have
influenced
the
verdict
of
the
jury
on
the
other
counts.
and
so
the
question
that
we
brought
to
the
court
and
the
only
question
that
we
think
it's
properly
involved
in
this
case
now
revolves
around
the
taking
of
money
to
give
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
congress.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
ordered
a
new
trial
on
the
other
phase
and
we
have
not
brought
that
issue
here.
we
referred
in
our
petition
but
we
did
not
argue
it,
i
might
say
largely
because
it
cannot
be
determined
without
reaching
--
reading
the
whole
record.
the
question
in
this
case
which
we
did
bring
here
and
which
we
think
it's
a
question
involved
is
this.
article
1,
section
6
of
the
constitution
provides
that
for
any
speech
or
debate
in
either
house,
no
member
of
congress
shall
be
questioned
in
any
other
place.
and
as
we
view
it,
the
question
is,
does
that
speech
or
debate
clause
means
that
congress
is
without
power
under
the
constitution
to
make
it
a
crime
triable
in
a
court
for
a
congressman
to
take
money
to
make
a
speech.
and
the
opinion
of
court
of
appeals
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
congress
had,
specifically
made
it
a
crime
at
what
was
formally
18
u.s.c.
205.
i
think
my
opponent
will
dispute
this,
because
he
says
if
a
speech
wasn't
have
to
a
matter
then
pending
it
wasn't.
this
indictment
was
brought
under
as
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
of
the
good
offices
of
a
congressman
in
two
parts;
one
to
make
the
speech
and
the
other
to
bring
his
influence
to
bear
on
the
department
of
justice
and
so
what
was
charged
is
the
conspiracy
under
371,
but
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
question,
it
is
no
doubt
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
its
opinion
which
is
in
volume
3
that
it
was
deciding
it
very
broadly,
said
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
make
it
a
crime
to
take
money
for
anything
that
came
within
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
which
under
this
court
kilbourn
decision
means
more
than
speech.
it
means
speech
or
vote
or
committee
report
or
anything
in
a
sense
which
is
official
action
and
so
that's
the
way
that
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
by
its
terms
made
it
constitutionally
impossible
for
congress
to
make
the
taking
of
money
or
bribery
a
crime
for
anything
done
within
the
protection
of
that
clause.
and
this
would
cover
205
as
well
as
the
aspect
of
371
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
and
now
i
think
it
is
helpful
both
for
the
general
problem
on
which
case
was
decided
and
for
this
particular
case,
if
we
consider
first
that
general
preposition
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
and
then
turn
to
that
particular
fact
that
this
case
to
see
whether
there's
special
problems
arising
out
of
the
fact
that
it
was
charged
under
371
or
in
the
particular
prosecution
here.
the
government's
basic
position
is
that
a
prosecution
for
taking
money
to
make
a
speech
does
not
question
that
speech
within
the
meaning
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
because
what
is
being
questioned
is
not
the
speech,
but
the
taking
of
the
money
and
the
taking
of
the
money
of
course
is
not
official
action
and
does
not
occur
on
the
floor
commonly.
i
don't
think
analytically
there
can
be
any
problem
with
that.
it's
obvious
that
the
taking
of
money
is
not
something
that's
official
action
on
the
floor
of
congress
and
i
think
that
it
becomes
clear
if
one
hypothesizes
a
situation
where
a
congressman,
where
the
evidence
is
discovered
immediately,
let's
say
by
a
tape
recorder
and
a
congressman
is
arrested
immediately
before
he
had
given
the
speech
for
which
he
took
money.
in
that
case
he
would
come
within
a
bribery
statute.
he
would
be
prosecuted
for
taking
money
to
make
a
speech,
but
the
speech
would
never
had
been
given
then
the
speech
and
debate
clause
would
never
come
into
play.
now
of
course
we
realize
that
the
question
isn't
normally
that
simple.
normally
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
am
coming
--
the
content
of
the
speech
was
not
relied
on
by
the
government.
the
only
copy
of
the
speech
which
the
government
introduced
was
a
reprint,
ordered
by
his
co-conspirator.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
would
introduce
to
show
it
was
one
apart
of
the
evidence,
showing
that
money
was
taken
for
the
speech,
but
let
me
point
out
that
the
reprint
that
was
introduced
was
in
at
least
one
significant
respect
different
from
the
speech
that
was
given,
because
the
caption
was
changed
on
the
reprint.
the
caption
on
the
original
speech
which
the
government
did
not
introduce,
dependent
introduced
the
original
speech,
caption
on
the
original
speech
was
something
like
the
maryland
savings
and
loan
industry.
the
caption
on
the
reprint
that
was
introduced
was
federal
savings
and
loan
leaves
seek
discretion
of
competitive
independence
and
commercial
mortgage
insurance.
now
of
course
the
government
gave
evidence
about
the
speech,
it
gave
reasons
about
how
it
was
prepared
and
what
use
was
made
of
it
by
the
co-conspirators.
of
course
it
was
the
government's
theory
that
money
was
given
to
make
a
speech,
but
it
was
not,
the
content
of
the
speech
was
not
part
of
the
governments
plan.
and
they
also
say
it
came
in
a
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
after
doing
--
not
as
part
of
government
affirmative
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
after
the
defendant
took
the
stand,
he
was
cross
examined
about
some
statements
in
the
speech
and
they
were
commented
upon
in
oral
argument,
but
if
the
government
in
its
affirmative
case
did
not
rely
on
the
content
of
the
speech
or
the
government
relied
on
was
on
other
evidence,
but
as
i
say
leaning
that
out
as
the
moment
the
specific
problems
here,
the
question
was
court
of
appeals
deciding
is
not
that.
it
did
not
decide
simply
that
it
was
too
much
reference
to
the
speech
in
this
case.
it's
said
much
more
broadly
that
it
is
beyond
the
competence
of
congress
to
provide
for
to
make
it
a
crime,
to
take
money
to
make
a
speech
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
understand
it
is
this.
no
matter
how
strong
the
evidence,
even
if
the
government
never
even
introduces
the
speech,
assuming
the
speech
has
once
been
given,
as
it
would
be
in
the
normal
case,
no
matter
how
strong
the
evidence
the
government
introduces,
any
congressman
who
can't
deny
that
he
took
money.
its
of
course
would
be
the
best,
but
assuming
he
can't
deny
that
he
took
money,
he
will
be
called
upon
to
explain,
he
will
feel
compelled
to
explain
that
he
gave
the
money
–
that
he
gave
a
speech
not
for
money
but
for
some
other
reason.
and
therefore
taking
the
language
out
of
cases
like
this
court's
decision
in
tenney
against
brandhove,
which
says
that
the
motives
of
official
action
cannot
be
questioned.
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
bring
motive
into
the
case,
because
the
congressman
will
feel
compelled
to
explain
his
motives
and
that's
not
the
speech
in
debate
clause,
but
as
we
see
it,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
this
situation
and
tenney
and
others
like
it
[inaudible]
is
that
when
you
bring
an
action
in
libel
which
what
tenney
was
or
where
the
speech
and
debate
clause
got
started,
where
the
king
brought
an
action
for
sedition
or
treason
or
criminal
libel
so
that
either
civilly
or
criminally
whenever
this
is
done,
the
affirmative
part
of
the
plaintiffs
case
is
that
you
prove
the
speech,
the
content
of
the
speech.
you
prove
that
the
contents
were
injurious,
that
it
results
in
the
injury,
either
to
the
individual
bringing
the
action
or
to
the
state
because
the
contents
were
treasonable
or
seditious
in
the
old
days
and
that
this
injury
was
caused
by
a
bad
motive
and
the
court
said
no.
that's
too
dangerous
to
free
speech.
they
said
and
the
reason
of
it
i
think
it's
barely
evident.
the
most
noble
test
at
most
accurate
speech
that
it
can
be
made
can
result
an
injury
to
someone.
i
mean,
it's
justifiable
injury,
but
it
is
injury,
therefore
when
you
have
to
start
and
say
this
injury
is
a
good
motive
or
bad
motive,
that
becomes
court
say
too
difficult.
because
too
many
actions
--
they
didn't
come
a
prosecutor
brings
for
example,
brings
its
lawsuit
against
this
defendant
to
be
injured,
the
defendant
will
be
get
in
to
jail,
it's
too
hard
to
distinguish
if
he's
doing
it
for
a
good
motive
or
a
bad.
its
hard
to
say,
is
the
speech
reasonable?
situation
is
very
different
from
bribery,
because
you're
not
resting
on
the
content
of
speech
to
show
injury
which
comes
from
a
bad
motive.
what
you're
resting
on
is
what
i
said
in
the
beginning,
you're
resting
on
the
taking
of
the
money
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
speech
is
about.
the
speech
could
be
the
best
speech
in
the
world,
it
could
absolutely
accurate
in
every
degree,
but
the
injury
doesn't
come
from
the
speech.
the
injury
to
the
government
comes
from
the
taking
of
the
money,
that's
the
injury
and
you
don't
relay
on
the
contents
of
the
speech
even
to
show
injury
or
you
don't
rely
on
the
content
of
a
speech
as
the
foundation
of
your
action.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but
you
don't
rest
on
the
speech,
what
you
rests
on
is
at
the
act.
the
orders
of
the
case
of
justice
harlan,
you
rest
on
the
speech
to
show
the
injury
and
then
you
say
i
have
been
injured
by
the
speech
and
it
was
not
done
for
good
motives,
it
was
done
for
a
bad
motive,
but
the
injury
comes
from
the
speech,
in
bribery
the
injury
doesn't
come
from
the
speech.
the
injury
comes
from
the
taking
of
the
money
and
it
points
in
this
case.
he
made
it
a
speech
in
favor
of
[inaudible],
which
they
use
but
suppose
they
had
a
different
scheme.
suppose
they
have
a
scheme
where
one
congressman
who's
supposed
to
make
a
speech
for
them
and
a
speech
against
them,
each
took
money
because
they
wanted
to
make
it
appear,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
where
the
one
was
for
them
or
one
was
against
them,
both
would
be
guilty
of
taking
bribes.
the
content
of
the
speech
don't
make
any
difference.
the
injury
doesn't
come
from
the
content
of
the
speech.
the
injury
comes
from
the
taking
of
the
money
and
that's
the
essential
difference
between
this
situation
and
tenney
and
i
point
out
this
is
not
really
unique.
we
have
a
principle
about
judicial
decisions,
so
for
as
an
action
for
libel
or
action
for
treason
are
concerned
the
content
of
the
judicial
privilege
is
set.
this
court
held
back
in
231
united
states
that
the
principle
that
a
judge
couldn't
be
sued
for
libel
was
so
much
of
a
part
of
our
system
of
doing
things
that
it
extended
to
philippines
immediately
without
any
--
as
by
virtue
of
the
constitution
without
any
special
act
of
congress
and
yet
we've
always
had
a
statute
from
1790
on,
we've
had
a
statute
making
bribery
of
the
judge
of
crime,
there
had
been
prosecution
to
judges
for
taking
bribe.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
as
i
point
out
mr.
justice,
this
court
said
that
the
principle
that
judges
cannot
be
sued
or
that
the
content
of
–
decisions
cannot
be
sued
for
malice
was
at
least
so
much
part
of
our
system
of
government,
i
think
they
consider
part
of
separation
of
power,
that
they
extend
it
to
the
philippines
as
a
constitutional
right,
the
minute
we
applied
it
didn't
get
the
special
statute
of
congress.
so
it
comes
in,
in
a
different
historical
way.
there's
no
question
about
that.
it
came
in
because
judges
in
the
sense
were
acting
the
way
of
not
responsible
to
anybody
about
themselves
and
therefore
they
didn't
--
they
weren't
the
problems.
the
difficulty
--
one
of
the
problems
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
i
think
is
that
side
by
side
in
the
beginning
with
the
development
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
was
the
attempt
by
parliament
to
get
himself
completely
out
of
the
crown
what
was
known
as
the
lex
parliament.
and
it
is
sometimes,
there's
been
a
tendency
to
read
some
of
the
lex
parliament
into
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
this
court
decided
in
watkins
and
had
decided
before
that
that
that
aspect,
the
power
of
the
parliament
just
couldn't
be
reached
by
the
crown
at
all.
it's
not
a
part
of
an
american
law.
watkins
discusses
this
at
length
but
and
for
that
reason
the
the
speech
and
debate
clause
as
i
say
had
the
different
historical
background,
but
if
you
look
at
the
contents
of
it
it's
not
essentially
different
from
the
contents
of
the
judicial
privilege,
which
was
recognized
back
in
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief,
but
the
one
that
i
think
is
most
significant
is
this
alzua
against
johnson
in
231
united
states
where
the
court
said
that
a
judicial
privilege
of
a
judge
against
sue
--
with
the
claim
of
maryland.
extended
to
the
philippines
without
just
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
acquired
the
philippines,
it
is
one
of
those
fundamental
rights
it
didn't.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
that
didn't
come
in.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
he
takes
the
money
to
make
the
speech.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
sir,
congress
so
intended
i
think
--
if
we
did
that
201
has
now
been
redrafted,
the
competence
of
interest
statute
had
now
been
redrafted
and
what
was
205,
which
made
it
a
crime.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
yes,
to
accept
money
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it's
18
u.s.c
205.
it's
not
in
our
brief.
we
have
281
but
we
don't
have
205.
but,
in
our
reply
brief,
oh,
in
our
required
brief,
your
honor
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
doesn't
say
speech,
what
it
says
is
it's
in
our
reply
brief
on
the
footnote
four
on
page
seven
it
says,
--
it
provided
for
the
punishment
of
any
congressman
who
agrees
to
receive
money
and
now
i'm
quoting,
“with
the
intent
to
have
his
action
and
so
or
the
decision
influence
in
any
question,
matter,
cause
or
proceeding,
which
may,
at
anytime
depending
in
either
house
of
congress
or
before
any
committee;
thereof
or
which
by
law
maybe
brought
before
him
in
his
capacity
as
such
member.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
means
is
he
does
it
for
money.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it's
the
same
as
if
he
voted
for
a
bill.
i
think
the
situation
is
no
different
that
if
he
took
$500.00
to
vote
yes
on
a
bill.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
and,
in
the
manson
case,
which
was
a
present
judicial
case,
an
argument
was
made,
well,
nobody
shown
that
the
judges'
decision
was
wrong
and,
the
second
circuit
says,
“no,
nobody
has.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
proof
indicates
that
he
made
a
decision
that
he
thought
was
probably
right,
but
the
fact
that
he
did
it
for
money,
and
not
honestly,
and
to
take
the
real
purpose
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
was
not
part
of
the
government's
case.
i
think
there
was
--
there
was
on
course
examination.
they
brought
out
facts
which
one
could
read
this
--
that
someone
could
reach
this
conclusion,
but
it
was
not.
the
government
did
not
rest
on
that
as
part
of
its
case,
no.
the
theory
of
robbery
statutes
quite
generally,
as
i
understand
it
is,
that
if
you
take
money
to
influence
official
action,
this
is
true
any
parties,
judges,
prosecutors,
executives,
you
take
money
to
influence
official
action,
that's
a
crime.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
there's
a
mistake
your
honor.
i
--
205
was
not
factored
in
our
brief.
281
referred
--
this
thing
you
have
to
remember
that
this
case
dealt
with
two
aspects,
the
conspiracy
charge
with
two
aspects,
and
all
the
substantive
counts
on
the
281
where
in
the
281
made
up
with
the
representations
before
the
department
of
justice.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and,
somehow,
205
just
didn't
get
cited
in
our
brief
its
former
205.
the
201,
281
and
205
are
both
now
incorporated
in
201,
which
is
the
conflict
of
interest
statute.
it
was
reenacted
in
1962,
which
the
day
after
the
crime
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
205
18
u.s.c.
205
in
the
1960
edition
and
the
only
precedent
is
quoted.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
old
205,
and
it's
on
page
seven
of
our
reply
brief
footnote
four,
the
significant
aspect.
note
as
i
say
this
wasn't
charged
directly
under
205
let
me
make
this
clear.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
this
was
charged
as
the
conspiracy
to
defraud
to
the
united
states
because
it
was
in
two
aspects.
it
was
to
[inaudible]
the
united
states
to
the
good
services
of
the
congressman
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
opponent
makes
a
big
issue
of
that.
but,
this
is
the
way
it
was
done
in
manson,
it
was
done
in
black,
it
was
done
may.
it
is
normally
done
that
way
where
you
have
a
continuing
conspiracy
with
several
aspects
because
this
was,
the
basic
charge
here
was
that
he
was
bought
to
use
the
vernacular,
to
use
his
congressional
influence
for
his
two
co-conspirators
and
his
congressional
influence
was
used
in
several
ways
one
of
which
was,
to
make
the
speech
and
the
other
was,
to
bring
his
influence
to
bear
on
the
department
of
justice.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
your
honor,
i
think,
you
have
different
[inaudible]
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
view
with
differently
--
we
view
with
what
was
bad
was
taking
the
money
and
it
was
taking
the
money
to
influence
his
official
action
it
was
doing
something
for
money,
whether
he
would
have
done
it
otherwise
or
not
is
immaterial.
and,
this
can't
fine
true
or
not
that
the
whole
temptation
of
bribery
law
is
for
the
whole
purposes
of
free
speech
and
debate
clause
and
the
purposes
of
that
the
privilege
is
then
recognizing
so
as
to
say
we
want
people
to
exercise
their
best
judgment.
and,
particularly,
in
the
speech
and
debate
cause,
the
reason
the
congressman
are
protected
is
that
we
want
them
to
be
able
to
speak
for
the
whole
people,
for
their
constituents
without
fear
and
so
on,
but
when
somebody
dissenting
for
money
is
exact
opposite
of
the
purpose
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
can't
--
they
think
i
--
then,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
back
in
1862,
the
congressman
thought
they
said
it
was
as
comprehensive
as
a
man
could
make
it
or
something
of
that
sort.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but,
i'd
--
i
see
–
i
don't
see
for
at
that
any
different
from
any
of
the
situation,
you
are
private
juror,
it
perfectly
possible
the
juror
might
vote
into
[inaudible]
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
it
perfectly
possibly
might
have
acquitted
anyway
as
i
say
we
have
a
situation
of
judge
madden
who
probably
would
have
rendered
the
same
decisions
anyway
one
might
have.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
you
can't,
base
it
on
what
he
said
in
the
speech
but
then--
when
couldn't--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
when
he
have
done
anything
to
judgment
and
for
what
he
said
as
an
opinion.
it
might
have
been
much
worse
and
what
he
said
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it
isn't.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
suppose
if
--
this
--
as
i
say
it,
i
said
at
the
beginning,
if
we
have
a
situation
where
he
took
money
to
make
a
speech
and
never
made
the
speech,
if
he
was
to
prove
it
and
at
sometimes
one
can,
there
have
been
such
situation,
not
with
the
congressman
but
with
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
you
mean
without
introducing
the
reprints?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
would
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
we
have
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
he
made
a
speech
but
we
do
not
have
--
we
did
not
have
to
do
this.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
did
not
have
to
prove
the
content
and
as
i
say
the
contents
that
we
did
prove,
there's
no
question,
we
did
introduce
the
reprint,
but
the
contents
that
we
did
introduce
were
the
reprints
and
the
reprints
were
at
least
so
far
as
the
type
of
what's
concerned
and
the
significant
part,
significantly
different,
the
type
of
it
was
different,
the
rest
of
the
speech
was
[inaudible]
except
that
when
the
[inaudible]
is
sent
it
out,
they
undermined
it
in
red.
but,
i
think
it's
very
different
situation
because
i
think
the
whole
point
is
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
is
out
to
protect
the
contents
of
the
speech.
and,
if
you
look
at
every
case
in
which
the
speech
and
debate
clause
has
been
discussed.
as
i
said
before,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
content
of
the
speech
are
the
foundation
of
the
action,
because
it
is
the
content
which
give
you
the
injury.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
think
you're
doing
the
good
faith
in
the
speech
into
question
anymore
than
you
are
the
good
faith
of
the
decision.
if
you
say
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
when
you
impugn
a
speech
but
that
isn't
what
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
i
don't
think
--
but
the
speech
and
debate
clause
without
to
protect
was
the
right
of
a
congressman.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
it
is
questioned
on
what
he
said,
that
you
should
not
question
what
he
said.
i
think
that's
what
the
speech
or
debate
clause
means.
that
you
shall
not
question
what
was
done,
i
think,
because
it
is
possible
this
time
--
this
court
said
in
the
time
case
[inaudible]
could
have
been
into
the
heat
of
the
debate
but
you
can't
say
he
made
a
mistake
and
he
injured
me
and
therefore,
he
has
to
be
liable.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
we
did,
i
mean
whether
it's
hard
to
say.
there
was
a
question
preliminary
evidence
but
i
suppose
--
i
--
we
certainly
did
prove
that
he
made
the
speech.
we
proved
to
the
public
relations
made.
maybe
at
this
point,
i
should
just
summarize
what
our
proof
was.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i'm
sorry.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
i
think
--
i
think
the
government
could
not
base
its
affirmative
case
of
the
cons
--
on
the
content
of
the
speech.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
let
me
say
that
i
think
as
the
court
here
that
is
as
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
no
because
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it
very
broadly.
they
decided
that
any
prosecution
for
bribery
was
barred
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
and
now,
obviously,
if
that
is
decided
again
differently
from
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it
and
it
is
possible
and
the
court
holds
that
there
can
be
prosecutions
for
bribery,
then
it
begs
to
the
question
of,
“is
this
prosecution?”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
except
that
the
court
of
appeals
never
did
decide
mostly
that
if
it
can't
involve
too
much
use
of
the
speech.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
no
speech.
the
minute
you
have
a
prosecution
for
bribery
to
make
a
speech
that
outlawed.
now,
the
question
of
whether
i
think
that
decision
would
be
made
on
the
book
firmly
can't
be
affirmed
obviously
on
different
grounds,
but
i
think
that
the
decision
has
rendered
us
prevent
the
broader
question.
now,
there
is
involved
in
that
a
narrower
question
of
whether
too
much
use
was
made
of
the
speech
here
and
that
just
brings
me
to
the
question
of
what
we
proved
in
this
case.
what
we
showed
was,
that
edlin
and
one
of
his
companies
was
under
indictment
and
interested
in
getting
what
one
might
call
a
federal
public
image
so
they
hired
a
public
relations
man
named
edlin
and,
they
talked
about
having
a
speech
made
in
april
in
may
of
1960.
the
speech
that
they
prepared
--
this
is
what
the
government's
affirmative
case
showed
obviously
contemplated
the
speech
in
the
house
of
representatives.
the
draft
--
they
were
preparing
draft
to
the
speech
because
references
were
put
in
to
a
mister
speaker.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
mr.
speaker,
indicating
that
they
expected
it
to
be
given
in
the
house
of
representatives.
this
was
the
draft.
in
may,
at
a
luncheon
with
respondent,
edlin
and
the
public
relations
man
discussed
in
general,
the
plight
of
the
of
the
so
called
independent
maryland
savings
and
loan
institution,
as
i
say
one
of
which
whom
was
under
indictment.
sometime
in
may,
it
doesn't
appear
exactly
when
in
relation
to
this
luncheon
with
respondent,
heflin
told
edlin
that
there
was
no
time
limit
in
the
speech,
no
reason
to
make
it.
however,
on
may
27,
1963,
there
was
this
jury
in
the
financial
pages
of
the
washington's
jar
which
called
the
maryland
savings
and
loan
associations
phoney.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
phoney.
after
that
heflin
and
edlin's
attorney,
who
was
the
defendant
robinson
went
to
the
respondent's
office
and
they
discussed
the
star
article
with
him
and
showed
him
these
drafts
--
the
draft
that
they
had
prepared.
robinson
said
his
administrative
assistant
would
go
over
the
material
i
mean
respond
that
his
administrative
assistant
would
go
over
the
material.
subsequently,
heflin
as
a
public
relations
man,
supplied
facts
and
figures
and
the
administrative
assistant
sent
him
a
draft.
heflin
learned
about
the
speech
about
two
days
after
it
was
given
and
issued
a
press
release
based
on
the
speech.
edlin
issued
fifty
thousand
reprints
for
his
company
and
the
marked
parts
have
them
in
red
and
sent
them
out
in
answers
to
people
wrote
in
about
the
maryland
savings
and
loan
association.
it's
about
this
time
they
started
–
they
reactivated
the
second
of
this
company
which
should
have
been
dormant
until
then
called
red
continental
and
they
sent
out
in
the
answers
to
inquiries
about
the
institution,
copies
of
the
speech
with
underlining
in
red.
as
i
said
before,
the
only
copies
of
the
speech
which
the
government
introduced
in
this
direct
case
was
one
of
these
reprints
which
had
a
very
different
kind
of
a
heading
--
a
much
more
dramatic
heading
about
the
federal
savings
and
loans
seeking
destruction
of
the
independent.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
all
this
was
relevant
as
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
congressman
taking
money
to
work
in
the
interest
--
in
the
edlin
interest
first,
to
make
a
speech
and
then,
to
bring
pressure
on
the
department
of
justice.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh!
it
shows
that
it
was
done,
i
think
hence,
to
prove
that
it
was
done
for,
besides
[inaudible]
any
other
money
[inaudible]
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but,
the
caption
was
not
the
caption
of
the
speech.
the
caption
put
on
the
speech
was
not
the
caption
of
the
speech
as
is
reported
in
the
congressional
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
it
tends
to
prove
to
that,
i
think
it
is
a
fact
that
we
did
not
rely
on
the
speech
as
given
its
part
of
the
affirmative
play.
it
shows
that
it
was
one
of
the
circumstances
that
indicate
that
this
was
part
of
the
conspiracy
that
this
was
prepared
that
the
speech
was
given
for
money,
for
the
interest
of
the
defendant,
of
the
co-defendant,
the
co-conspirators
who
gave
the
money
and
on
the
money
question
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
the
charge
with
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
of
the
good
offices
of
the
congressman
and
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
they
all
conspired
to
defraud
the
united
states
of
the
honest
services
of
the
congressman,
of
the
honest
services
of
the
department
of
justice
and
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
it
was
on
the
conspiracy
charge.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
the
other
separate
counter
charge
here
the
others
would
charge
if
they're
to
admit
that
to
be
put
as
a
violation
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
was
convicted.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
was
convicted
of
the
substantive
count
and
the
only
reason
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
was
that
they
thought
maybe
the
evidence
as
to
the
speech
had
a
bearing
on
the
conviction
of
the
other
count.
i
think
when
we
in
the
record
might
be
in
the
other
way
when
we
could
have
read
it,
had
come
to
another
conclusion
but
we
have
not
brought
that
issue
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
this
count
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
but
they
were
reversed
because
of
the
speech
issue.
now
on
the
question
of
the
money
what
was
shown
was
that
ten
days
before
the
speech
was
given,
respondent
received
$500.
this
wasn't
given
directly.
it
was
a
check
sent
by
robinson
who
was
the
attorney
and
who
lived
in
florida,
and
it
was
sent
to
respondent.
now
he
endorsed
it
over
to
his
campaign
treasurer
that
came
in
the
government's
case.
subsequently,
in
august
respondent
received
a
$1,000
check
from
robinson
for
which
robinson
was
reimbursed
by
ones
of
savings
and
loan
institutions
that
was
marked
of
legal
services.
in
november
there
was
a
$300
check
to
a
campaign
treasurer
again
from
robinson
in
florida
for
which
robinson
was
again
reimbursed
this
time
[inaudible]
by
continental
and
then
starting
in
january
1961
there
were
four
checks
for
$800
and
then
from
march
to
october
and
it
was
march
to
october
when
the
representation
to
the
department
of
justice
were
made,
it
was
about
$20,000
all
paid
through
robinson
and
to
the
defendant
like
the
government
also
show
as
part
of
it's
affirmative
case
was
that
there
were
no
legal
services
rendered
for
this
money.
the
proof
of
that
became
even
stronger
as
the
respondent
had
testified
and
so
if
you
read
the
opinion
a
good
deal
of
that
proof
does
referred
to
the
testimony
of
the
respondent
but
the
government
did
show
affirmative
proof
in
that
direction.
now
it's
therefore
evident
that
the
government
did
not
rely
on
the
content
of
the
speech
at
all
to
prove
this
case.
it
did
prove
that
speech
was
given.
it
did
prove
that
the
speech
was
useful
and
was
used
by
it's
--
the
co-conspirators.
it
did
prove
that
money
went
from
the
co-conspirators
to
respondent
and
did
prove
that
he
did
not
render
services
which
would
justify
that
money
and
that
was
the
government
has.
now
when
respondents
got
up
he
did
that
or
i
think
i
should
say
one
other
thing
it
doesn't
show
up
in
the
appendix
but
there
isn't
a
[inaudible]
evidence
that
reporter
from
the
washington
post
talked
to
respondents
in
december
1961
which
is
before
the
they
were
given
any
action
both
about
representations
before
the
department
of
justice
and
the
representation
and
the
speech.
and
the
government
affirmatively
did
put
on
that
reporter
who
said
that
respondent
told
him
in
1961
that
he
made
the
speech
because
the
constituents
asked.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
because
the
constituent
asked
it.
as
i
said
that
wasn't
reprinted
in
the
appendix
but
it
is
in
the
record.
now
when
respondent
took
the
stand
he
did
say
that
he
gave
a
speech
because
he
thought
it
would
make
a
good
campaign
issue
and
the
government
of
course
examined
him
about
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
they
had
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
before
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
indictment
of
the
court
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
--
and
it
had
been
overruled
by
the
district
judge
who
said
that
it
didn't
do
it.
i
don't
recall
that
every
time
any
piece
of
evidence
came
in
specifically
on
that
that
they
made
that
objection
in
those
terms.
there
were
various
objections
in
the
court
held
that
other
things
questions
about
why
they
went
further
into
the
conspiracy
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
there
was
in
motion
for
acquittal
at
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
he
renewed
the
motion
before
trial
and
i
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
they
were
focused
narrowly
on
the
fact
that
too
much
use
was
made
of
the
speech
as
such.
it
was
generally,
there
is
no
question
that
consistently
the
defendant
has
argued
by
motion
to
dismiss
the
motion
for
acquittal
and
so
on
that
the
whole
constitution
was
[inaudible]
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
he's
raised
that
point
consistently
but
as
i
say
one
of
the
problems
is
that
to
where
this
has
been
approached
broadly,
it's
been
approached
as
if
there
is
prosecution
is
possible
or
is
it
not
and
i
don't
think
at
any
stage
really
there
has
been
any
sharp
vote
that
it's
been
mentioned
that
the
defendant
uses
it
in
support
of
his
argument
and
we
did
talk
about
in
our
main
brief
but
there
has
not
been
any
sharp
purpose
on
the
narrow
question
of
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
sharp
protest
on
the
narrow
question
of
whether
in
this
particular
trial
there
was
reliance
or
too
much
reliance
on
the
contents
of
the
speech.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
that
would
be
a
permissible
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
just
urging
it.
that's
very
different
it
seems
to
me
from
buying
somebody.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
they
have
a
right
to
petition
but
they
don't
have
the
right
to
bribe.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
it's
bad.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
we
do
have
your
honor
has
it
and
the
court
has
upheld
that,
the
people
who
lobby
have
to
register
so
that
there
is
and
i
think
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
that
there's
a
big
difference
also
from
saying
that
one
may
raise
money
and
petition
and
request
a
congressman
or
any
interested
economic
group
has
the
right
to
bring
[inaudible]
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right,
but
i
think
it
is
very
different
situation
where
and
in
the
sense
empathetical
to
the
whole
idea
that
of
the
right
to
petition
where
you
have
somebody
passing
money
surreptitiously
under
the
table.
i
think
its
exactly
then
and
the
feeling
that
congressman
do
something
not
because
of
whatever
legitimate
political
pressures
do
but
for
money
this
is
a
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
because
that's
their
right
to
petition.
but
this
is
bringing
not
a
normal
political
pressure
but
the
pressures
of
money
to
bear
in
a
sense
to
divert
the
normal
political
pressures.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
said
that
the
congress
could
make
this
for
him.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
the
congress
has
to
right
that
we
don't
want
bonuses
and
i
think
the
congress
had
done
so.
the
congress
has
done
it
since
1853.
it
has
the
bribery
statute
on
the
congress
if
then
so
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
the
constitution
said
that,
but
--
well,
as
in
the
executive
department
and
then
they
do
say
the
congressman
can't
do
certain
type
of
things
in
their
private
employment
but
the
congress
has
also
said
and
they
said
it
since
1853.
every
legislature
i
think
of
every
state
the
union
had
said
it,
we
don't
want
congressman
voting
or
making
speeches
for
money.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
this
court
said
since
the
time
kilbourn
against
thompson
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
includes
voting.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
encompasses
voting
as
well
as
future
debate.
that's
been
decided
in
kilbourn
against
thompson
and
i
think
and
since
the
old
massachusetts
case
that
this
court
had
cited
in
tenney,
coffin
against
coffin
before
massachusetts.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
statute
says
the
action
on
any
matter
pending
but
i
don't
think
the
fact
--
now
in
the
massachusetts
bribery
statute
for
instance
specifically
mentioned
speech
but
to
say
that
a
matter
is
within
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
then
its
not
within
this
comprehensive
bribery
statute
it
seems
to
me
very
inconsistent.
i
think
the
fact
is
that
i
have
--
it
vote,
it's
within
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
it
--
had
so
been
interpreted
by
this
court
from
the
beginning
then
there
is
no
constitutional
difference
between
speech
or
vote
and
something
--
there
are
all
kinds
of
actions
that
it
done
we
have
it
right
down
the
line.
all
kinds
of
action
which
cannot
be
questioned
in
the
sense
that
you
can't
show
that
its
bad
judgment
or
that
it
was
done
from
[inaudible].
you
have
it
as
to
prosecutors,
the
courts
stated
they
have
--
you
can't
sue
them
making
their
judgment
and
from
now
it's
--
you
have
it
as
the
judge,
you
have
it
as
the
congressman.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
different
because
then
he's
being
prosecuted
for
taking
a
$1,000
to
make
it.
i
don't
think
that's
there's
any
difference
in
saying
that
a
juror
votes
to
acquit
because
he
likes
people
with
red
hair
and
that's
--
that
there's
nothing
anybody
can
do
about
it.
they
vote.
but
if
a
juror
vote
to
acquit
because
somebody
gave
him
a
$1,000
can
prosecuted,
and
exactly
this
comes
within
the
speech
and
debate
clause
but
that
principle
doesn't
seem
to
me
any
different.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
any
different
if
you
say
this
is
a
perfectly
sound
accusation
which
would
stand
up
in
any
appellant
court
and
which
this
court
would
affirm
but
you
can't
give
it
for
--
you
can't
take
a
$1,000
to
give
it.
i
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
what
constitutes
questioning
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
the
judicial
privilege
and
the
--
there's
never
been
question
that
you
can't
have
people
going
around
bribing
jurors,
bribing
judges.
and
i
don't
think
why
it
should
be
different
for
congressman
and
the
point
is
not
what
i
think,
the
point
is
that
the
congress
had
not
thought
should
be
a
different
proponent.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
then
your
question
is
a
very
narrow
one
which
is
when
former
205
which
was
passed
in
1862,
the
congressman
on
the
board
said
“this
is
a
comprehensive
legislation
that
we
know
how
to
do
it.”
that's
what
they
said
about
it
at
that
time.
it
does
not
in
so
many
words
use
speech
but
it
uses
what
they
thought
--
well
i
think
comprehensively
with
what
the
congress
thought
was
comprehensive
language.
and
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
was
part
of
it
that
they
certainly
use
--
they
specifically
used
word
action,
action,
to
have
it
action
vote
or
division
influence.
now
this
is
not
to
anyone,
this
is
not
the
conflict
of
interstate,
this
is
not
dealing
with
what
the
congress
did
as
such.
this
is
action
brought
or
decision
influenced
on
any
question
matter
for
or
proceeding
which
may
at
anytime
be
pending
in
either
house
of
congress
or
before
any
committee
thereof
or
which
by
law
maybe
brought
before
him
in
his
capacity
as
such
member,
that's
pretty
broad
language
and
it
covers
the
right
deal
and
all
the
state
has
similar
statutes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
i
please
the
court.
i
am
rather
surprised
to
find
that
the
professor
is
making
a
distinction
between
speech
and
vote
for
the
purposes
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
because
the
case
of
coffin
against
coffin
which
this
court
decided
in
(inaudible)
as
the
authoritative
decision
on
the
speech
and
debate
clause
makes
it
very
clear
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
kilbourn
against
thompson,
decision
in
(inaudible)
made
clear
that
the
state's
speech
and
debate
clause
covers
all
official
action
taken
in
the
capacity
as
represented
to
speech,
vote,
committee
report,
anything
of
that
character.
now,
to
the
english
history,
what's
strode's
was
a
case
of
someone
who
in
colonies
introduced
the
bill
regulating
tanneries.
i
think
it
turns
now
that
one
of
the
books
that
he
was
a
tenant
but
nothing
has
ever
turned
on
that.
what
happened
is
that
when
he
got
back
to
his
local
district,
where
the
act
that
he
was
in
favor
of
would
have
affected
the
local
industry.
the
local
government,
which
was
called
the
(inaudible)
tried
to
prosecute
him
for
introducing
these
bills
in
congress.
and
the
problem,
i'm
sorry
--
and
at
that
point,
parliament
passed
this
resolution
saying
that
no
--
for
what
he
did
in
parliament,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted,
in
this
case
by
a
local,
equivalent
to
our
county
government.
now,
that
became
--
strode
case
did
become
a
kind
of
slogan
case
thereafter
in
the
long
fight
between
parliament
and
the
crown,
which
i
wouldn't
have
to
--
have
time
to
go
and
to
now,
but
i've
point
out
two
things
about
the
english
history.
one
is
that
the
speech
and
debate,
the
right
of
parliament
to
talk
about
anything
--
which
was
divided
during
elizabeth's
time.
they
question
whether
the
parliament
could
talk
about
the
succession
for
the
religious
questions
which
are
coming
up.
that
question
was
settled
by
1689
in
the
english
bill
of
right.
the
period
of
the
18th
century
in
england
was
a
period
when
parliament
was
trying
to
get
for
itself,
not
simply
the
right
to
talk
about
anything,
but
the
right
completely
to
regulate
its
own
members
and
anybody
that
dealt
with
its
own
members.
and
that
period
was
a
period,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
crown
was
trying
to
bribe
congressmen
so
they
are
not
english
prosecutions
for
bribery,
but
that
alleged
parliament,
the
right
of
parliament
to
govern
itself
and
even
govern
people
that
dealt
with
it.
exclusively,
this
court
has
held
was
not
taken
over
into
american
law
and
if
it's
--as
the
court
pointed
it
out
in
the
watkins
case,
they
founders
of
our
constitution
were
very
worried
about
legislative
excess.
they
were
--
that
was
one
of
the
things
they
tried
to
guard
against
and
so,
the
lex
parliamentary
has
never
been
part
of
the
american
law.
the
absence
of
english
cases
therefore
is
not
controlling,
but
it
is
interesting
that
the
only
time
the
questions
of
bribery
statutes
have
come
up
for
decisions.
there
have
been
state
bribery
prosecutions
but
nobody
raised
any
problems
in
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
the
only
time
that
the
question
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
in
relation
to
prosecutions
for
bribery
of
congressman
has
been
brought
up
are
in
three
colonial
cases
which
are
on
page
34
of
our
main
brief
and
in
those,
there
was
only
one
dissenting
vote
and
the
dissent
was
on
the
ground
of
lex
parliamentaria.
the
other
three
cases
all
have
that
--
it
was
possible
--
they
--
some
of
them
said
that
it
was
a
crime
at
common
law
to
take
a
bribe
and
all
of
them
incidentally,
in
the
english
has
been
showing
its
relations
to
the
lex
parliamentary
considered
that
if
you
couldn't
prosecute
a
congressman
for
taking
a
bribe,
you
couldn't
prosecute
the
person
that
gave
him
the
bribe.
that
is
their
version,
in
other
words,
they
approached
the
question
pretty
much.
did
come
within
the
lex
parliamentary
or
it
didn't.
and,
as
i
say,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
from
the
time
of
the
anderson
against
dunn,
to
the
time
of
watkins
that
lex
parliamentaria
is
not
a
part
of
american
law,
which
we
took
over
from
great
britain.
so
that
from
the
purposes
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
possibility
of
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
speech
and
above.
and,
as
far
as
the
actual
coverage
of
0205
is
concerned,
in
1862,
when
it
was
passed
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
the
expressions
were
said
that
it
was
comprehensive
as
man
could
make
it.
as
for
the
argument
that
has
been
made
here
that
--
well,
it
wouldn't
have
come
within
1205
because
at
that
moment,
there
was
no
legislation
pending.
that
old
massachusetts
coffin
case
that
the
--
even
though
it
was
physically
said
in
the
floor
of
the
house,
if
it
wasn't
in
relation
to
legislative
matters,
it
wasn't
with
the
speech
within
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
we
have
never
contended
that.
we
admit
that
this
is
when
the
--
that
is
the
speech
itself
is
within
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
it
is
our
position
that
when
you
have
a
prosecution
for
taking
money
to
give
a
speech,
the
act
which
is
being
questioned
is
the
taking
of
the
money.
now,
in
that
kind
of
a
prosecution,
we
admit
it
will
--
it
was
brought
out
here
and
it
was
shown
that
the
speech
was
given.
this
was
also
alleged
in
the
indictment
but
the
prosecution
rested
on
the
proof
that
the
speech
was
prepared
with
a
purpose
in
line,
that
it
was
used
for
that
purpose,
that
money
did
go
to
the
congressman.
and,
let
me
say
one
thing
about
that,
the
theory
--
the
reason
this
prosecution
was
brought
under
371
and
not
to
violate
specific
statute,
was
that
it
was
the
theory
and
we
think
it's
established
by
the
evidence
that
this
congressman
was,
--
i
just
want
to
say,
put
on
pay
roll
to
do
the
thing
that
were
to
be
done.
the
speech
was
part
of
that.
it
was
not
all
of
it.
the
rest
of
it
and
the
most
important
part
goes
up
later
with
the
representations
for
the
department
of
justice.
but,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
government
takes
the
position
that
$500.00
was
all
that
was
given
for
the
speech.
