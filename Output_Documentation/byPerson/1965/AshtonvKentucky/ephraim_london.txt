mr.
ephraim
london
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
steve
ashton
was
convicted
of
criminal
libel
in
kentucky
in
1963,
november
1963.
it
was
a
common
law
crime.
the
appeal,
the
original
conviction
which
was
in
the
circuit
court
hazard,
he
appealed
it
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
affirmed
the
conviction
with
three
of
the
southern
judges
dissenting.
the
sentence
which
was
imposed
by
the
jury
was
six
months
in
jail
and
a
fine
of
$3000.
at
the
time
ashton
was
convicted,
he
was
a
college
student
at
(inaudible).
he
had
come
to
hazard,
kentucky
as
a
result
of
hearing
some
television
scenes
and
television
programs
in
which
the
plight
of
some
striking
miners
were
shown.
hazard,
kentucky
and
perry
county
was
the
center
of
a
mining
area
where
there
had
been
a
prolonged
labor
dispute.
some
of
the
miners
in
that
area
were
on
strike
and
some
were
not.
now,
ashton
who'd
come
down
as
the
representative
of
a
student
committee,
he
was
bringing
food
and
clothing
down
for
the
strikingminers.
and
while
there,
he
wrote
a
report
on
what
was
happening,
and
it
was
to
be
sent
i
believe
mostly
to
his
friends
and
colleagues
and
perhaps
to
some
others
who
would
be
willing
to
help
the
miners.
this
report
which
was
called
“notes
on
a
mountain
strike”
--
mr.
ephraim
london
back
home
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
was
mimeographed
and
i
believe
it
was
to
be
sent
primarily
back
home.
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
was
to
secure
funds.
i
think
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
although
it
is
not
clear
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
it.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
it's
our
position
that
it
was
not
distributed
at
all.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
some
policemen
did
get
hold
of
it.
what
they
did
with
it,
we
don’t
know
but
we
don't
believe
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ephraim
london
it
never
got
to
that
point.
it
would
have
been
available
i
suppose
but
ashton
never
got
to
the
point
of
distributing
these
pamphlets.
mr.
ephraim
london
while
in
the
person
--
mr.
ephraim
london
to
two
or
three
policemen,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
that's
correct.
we
shall
raise
the
question
of
whether
that
was
in
fact
a
publication.
i
like
to
come
to
that
a
little
bit
later
if
i
may.
but
there
were
three
people
supposedly
libeled
in
this
report.
one
was
sam
luttrell,
police
chief
of
hazard,
another
was
charles
combs,
the
high
sheriff
of
perry
county,
and
the
third
was
mrs.
nolan,
the
co-publisher
of
the
local
newspaper,
the
hazard
herald.
now,
the
things
that
were
written
about
the
high
sheriff
and
the
police
chief
were
certainly
unflattering.
but
for
the
most
part,
they
were
completely
true.
now,
for
example
ashton
wrote
that
the
sheriff
had
been
indicted
for
manslaughter
while
he
was
still
acting
as
sheriff
and
that
was
perfectly
true.
and
he
said
that
the
sheriff
although
he
was
supposed
to
be
impartial
in
this
dispute
between
the
striking
and
non-striking
miners,
was
actually
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
mine
and
that
was
perfectly
true.
and
he
wrote
that
the
sheriff
had
beaten
up
a
boy
in
the
sheriff's
jail
so
badly
that
the
boy
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
and
that
the
boy
was
tear-gassed
while
in
jail,
that
the
sheriff
had
to
pay
a
judgment
to
the
boy
of
$5000.
now,
it
was
true
that
the
boy
was
beaten
up.
it
was
true
that
he
had
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
and
it
was
true
he
recovered
a
judgment
against
the
sheriff
of
$5000.
but
it
appears
the
sheriff
wasn't
there
at
the
time.
and
that
the
beating
was
probably
administered
by
some
subordinates
of
the
sheriff.
ashton
said
that
the
sheriff
probably
bought
off
the
jury
that
rendered
the
verdict.
that
was
not
true.
and
at
least
it
wasn't
true
that
he
bought
off
the
jury.
the
word
probably
was
put
in
but
certainly
the
inference
of
that
statement
was
false.
now,
the
statements
he
made
about
the
police
chief
were
also
unpleasant
and
also
for
the
most
part
true.
he
said
that
the
police
chief
had
a
policeman
in
his
staff
who
sympathized
with
the
striking
miners
and
that
man
had
had
his
life
threatened.
well,
not
only
was
that
true
but
the
one
who
passed
on
the
threat
was
the
police
chief
himself.
he
said
that
--
ashton
said
that
the
police
chief
was
holding
down
a
private
job
as
a
guard
and
that
that
was
against
the
law.
but
that
was
untrue.
the
police
chief
wasn't
holding
down
an
outside
job.
he
certainly
wasn't
violating
the
law
in
that
respect.
now,
the
statements
made
about
mrs.
nolan
didn't
impute
my
thinking
any
serious
wrong
and
in
any
event
i
believe
they
were
true
but
i'd
like
to
speak
of
them
later
if
there
is
sufficient
time.
ashton
was
tried
twice,
first
jury
disagreed
and
the
second
jury
by
a
12
--
by
a
10
to
2
verdict,
found
him
guilty.
and
as
i
said
before
it
was
the
jury
that
imposed
the
sentence.
mr.
ephraim
london
there
was
one
trial.
the
indictment
doesn't
specify
separate
counts.
it
merely
says
that
he
was
guilty
of
having
libeled
the
three
named
persons.
mr.
ephraim
london
no
special
verdict.
it
was
a
general
verdict
to
guilty
by
the
jury.
and
there
was
no
indication
of
whether
they
find
him
guilty
of
libeling
the
sheriff
or
the
police
chief
or
mrs.
nolan.
that
wasn't
separately
stated
or
made
clear.
and
point
of
fact
there
had
been
in
the
--
named
in
the
indictment
a
mr.
nolan
who
was
the
other
owner
of
the
hazard
herald
and
the
indictment
as
against
him
was
dismissed
for
lack
of
proof.
now,
the
criminal
law
--
criminal
libel
law
of
kentucky
as
it's
construed
in
this
case
by
kentucky's
highest
court,
we
submit
is
unconstitutional.
now,
the
entire
law
we
state,
not
as
it's
applied
in
this
case
but
the
law
itself
is
we
think
clearly
unconstitutional
because
it
makes
writing
a
crime
when
that
writing
concededly
doesn't
create
any
serious
danger
to
the
community
and
indeed
even
to
the
individuals
who
maybe
libeled.
it
punishes
as
a
crime,
speech
that
doesn't
in
anyway
affect
the
public
or
the
community
or
the
state.
now,
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
any
private
per
se
libeled
which
is
made
with
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
statements
are
untrue
is
a
crime.
in
kentucky
any
per
se
libel.
and
it
is
conceded
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
criminal
law
is
designed
primarily
to
redress
purely
private
injury.
if
i
can
read
from
the
attorney
general's
brief,
just
a
moment
at
page
16,
he
states
that
it's
admitted
that
some
defamatory
publications
at
it's
lowest
which
could
be
punished
as
a
crime
would
not
be
serious
in
impact
as
others.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
“it
is
admitted
that
the
kentucky
common
law
offense
is
designed
to
protect
individual
reputation.
and
a
similar
statement
is
made
on
page
3
of
his
brief.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
a
--
that
is
part
of
it.
it
begins
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
it
begins
at
page
121
i
believe.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
is
the
whole
of
the
definition.
the
court
says
that
that
was
cured
by
some
statements
at
other
points
of
the
charge
in
which
he
says
that
this
stuff
has
to
be,
these
statements
have
to
be
false
and
that
the
petitioner
ashton
would
have
to
know
that
they
were
false.
i
should
like
to
get
into
that
question
later
but
what
i'm
talking
about
now
is
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals'
latest
description
of
this
crime.
in
its
opinion
in
this
case,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
said,
"we
must
disregard
this
kind
of
statement
that
was
made
by
the
trial
judge
that
this
really
isn't
the
law
anymore,
it
isn't
even
constitutional.
but
there
were
other
elements
in
this
charge
which
were
perfectly
correct
and
we
say
that
the
law
now
is
that
the
private
defamation
can
be
punished."
now,
the
law
of
civil
libel
or
libels
per
se
in
kentucky
are
very,
very
broad
indeed
if
for
example
i
--
i
know
mr.
matthews,
the
attorney
general
of
kentucky
is
a
--
or
assistant
attorney
general
is
an
open
and
honest
and
a
candid
man.
but
if
i
were
to
say
he
is
a
hypocrite
knowing
that
to
be
untrue,
that
is
a
criminal
libel
in
kentucky
also
a
civil
libel.
if
i
were
to
say
assuming
about
his
ancestors,
it
was
unpleasant,
even
if
they
were
dead,
two
or
three
or
four
generations,
i'm
guilty
of
a
criminal
libel
in
kentucky.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
it
has
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
law
is
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
doctrine
still
has
any
validity
that
one
cannot
make
any
writing
or
speech
or
communication
criminal
unless
it
presents
some
serious
danger
to
the
community.
and
as
i
understand
the
garrison
case,
i
understand
it
to
mean
that
a
libel
must
somehow
seriously
disturb
the
security
of
the
community
before
it
maybe
punished
as
a
crime.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
conviction
was
some
200
years
after
george
washington's
death.
mr.
ephraim
london
in
kentucky?
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
a
statute
relating
to
slander
but
this
is
a
common
law
offense.
mr.
ephraim
london
in
kentucky,
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
first
case
came
about
1888
in
which
they
suddenly
punished
someone.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
the
legislative
body
never
did
although
i
suppose
it
recognized
the
existence
of
this
as
a
common
law
crime
and
providing
for
general
punishment
under
a
statute
limiting
the
punishment
to
a
year
and
$5000
fine.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor
there
are.
mr.
ephraim
london
to
my
little
knowledge
of
kentucky
law,
i
think
the
majority
of
crimes.
mr.
ephraim
london
--
there
are
common
law
crimes.
mr.
ephraim
london
now,
the
attorney
general
of
kentucky
concedes
that
very
trifling
personal
abuse
can
be
punished
as
a
crime
in
kentucky.
but
he
says
that's
not
an
objection
to
the
law
because
the
jury
although
it
can
imprison
the
man
for
a
year
for
this
trifling
insult
and
can
fine
him
for
$5000
may
also
impose
a
very
small
punishment
even
if
a
dollar
fine
then
make
the
punishment
of
that
crime.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
provision
in
the
constitution
which
says
the
truth
maybe
proved
in
a
libel
case
because
under
the
common
law
in
england
as
your
honor
knows,
truth
was
not
a
defense.
the
constitution
doesn't
indicate
that
it's
a
clear
and
complete
defense
whether
it
says
it
can
be
proved.
and
i
believe
that
the
court
in
it's
clause
on
this
constitutional
provision
has
indicated
that
it
is
a
complete
defense.
i
think
that
certainly
in
this
case
there's
no
question
but
that
the
statement
has
to
be
false
in
order
to
be
punishable
as
a
crime.
and
the
truth
is
a
complete
defense.
mr.
ephraim
london
false
in
the
sense
that
it
is
untrue,
that
it's
contrary
to
fact.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
misstatement
of
the
facts.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
goes
even
further
by
the
way
in
including
opinion
although
that's
not
involved
here
because
i
think
to
say
that
one
is
a
hypocrite
is
an
opinion
rather
than
a
statement
of
fact
although
it
may
also
be
a
fact.
but
if
i
may
continue,
the
question
i
think
suggest
itself
if
every
libel
per
se
is
known
to
be
false
is
punishable
as
a
crime,
when
does
the
government
decide
what
cases
are
going
to
be
punished
as
a
crime
and
in
what
cases
does
the
kentucky
government
leave
the
individual
to
his
--
who
has
been
--
who
has
been
liable
to
his
civil
remedy
of
action
for
damages.
and
the
attorney
general
suggests
an
answer
in
his
brief.
he
indicates
that
criminal
libel
prosecution
is
appropriate
with
a
person
who
utters
a
libel
has
no
funds.
in
short,
it
maybe
a
crime
when
a
man
is
penniless
that
is
the
libel
of
it.
but
when
he
has
fines
with
which
to
respond
in
damages
then
the
inclination
of
the
government
would
be
to
leave
him
or
leave
the
man
liable
to
a
civil
remedy
in
damages.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
this
is
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
ephraim
london
may
i
read
at
page
20
of
his
brief.
and
they
say
this
is
a
suggestion.
mr.
ephraim
london
he
says,
“the
view
that
private
libel
and
personal
calumny
is
no
longer
appropriate
for
penal
control
as
unsound.
the
civil
suit
for
damages
may
be
an
adequate
threat
to
deter
deliberate
or
reckless
character
assassination
on
the
part
of
responsible
publisher
of
means
but
it
cannot
serve
the
guarantee
relief
from
this
positive
evil
in
the
case
of
those
who
were
immune
to
judgment
by
virtue
of
being
of
insufficient
worth.”
then
he
goes
on,
“the
threat
of
remedy
immediately
and
inexpensively
available
by
a
criminal
prosecution
is
an
effective
determine
--
deterrent
to
the
commission
of
such
a
real
harm."
in
other
words,
you
know,
we
can't
deter
a
fellow
who
has
money
because
--
but
we
have
to
worry
about
the
fellow
who
doesn't
have
money
and
who
goes
around
libeling
people.
and
the
only
way
we
can
deter
him
is
by
this
threat
of
criminal
prosecution.
now,
i
think
making
it
a
crime
where
a
man
is
penniless
and
a
civil
wrong
where
the
man
has
funds
doesn't
exactly
square
with
our
notions
of
equal
justice
to
the
indigent.
by
the
way,
a
similar
statement
to
the
one
that
i
just
referred
is
made
again
at
the
brief
in
the
introduction
where
the
attorney
general
writes
--
although
the
prevention
of
peace
--
of
the
--
or
breach
of
the
peace
is
no
longer
a
basis
for
criminality.
private
libel
should
be
subject
to
penal
sanctions
under
the
kentucky
common
law
in
order
to
deter
the
commission
of
harm
disturbing
the
community
sense
of
security
such
as
malicious
character
assassination
by
publication
of
calculated
falsehoods
by
impecunious
persons.
that's
at
page
3
of
the
brief.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
but
the
law
is
designed
and
the
attorney
general
has
indicated
in
order
to
protect
the
community
against
this
penniless
fellow
who
goes
around
insulting
people.
after
all,
the
judgment
against
him
isn't
much
good.
and
that's
why
it
covers
purely
private
personal
abuse
and
speaking
of
the
rationale
of
the
law
and
as
the
attorney
general's
concept,
its
application.
i
think
there's
another
answer
to
the
question
of
when
this
criminal
penalty
will
be
invoked
and
when
they
will
leave
the
individual
who
was
libeled
to
his
private
remedy
of
action
for
damages.
i
think
the
answer
is
suggested
by
this
case
because
criminal
libel
is
a
rare
prosecution
in
kentucky
as
elsewhere
in
the
united
states.
but
i
think
that
where
the
person
attacked
is
a
government
officer
with
the
power
to
initiate
the
criminal
prosecution,
you
are
very
likely
to
have
the
law
used
to
punish
the
personal
upfront
to
him.
i
think
most
of
the
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
have
been
cases
where
an
officer
of
the
law
who
had
the
power
to
initiate
criminal
prosecution,
the
one
who
did
it.
i
don't
think
we've
had
cases
in
this
court
in
which
a
purely
personal
upfront
to
a
private
individual
has
been
prosecuted
as
a
criminal
libel
and
then
brought
up.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
case
was
tried
before
new
york
times
against
garrison
but
the
appeal
was
heard
after
new
york
times
against
garrison
and
one
sees
the
references
to
that
case
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
this
court's
opinion
in
times
against
ga
--
sullivan
and
in
garrison
against
cox
was
the
reason
for
the
--
for
a
change
in
the
law
of
kentucky
that
was
made
by
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
but
i
shall
get
to
that
later
i
hope.
now,
we
do
have
another
related
question
relating
to
publication
and
to
the
question
that
was
asked
before
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
whether
or
not
this
pamphlet
was
ever
distributed
in
the
community.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
they
--
i
don't
remember
anything
that
the
court
says
nece
--
with
respect
to
the
showing
of
public
damage.
i
think
that
there's
a
reference
to
a
browning
case
in
which
they
had
--
i
think
it
was
browning
where
there
had
been
the
libeling
of
a
public
official
that
or
least
one
of
the
early
cases,
there
was
a
libeling
of
a
public
official.
and
the
court
as
i
said
in
its
opinion
has
indicated
that
the
rule
of
the
sullivan
case
now
applies
in
kentucky
namely
that
malice
has
to
be
shown,
that's
another
question
that
i'd
like
to
get
to
in
just
a
moment.
but
returning
to
the
question
of
publication,
what
happened
here
is
that
while
ashton
was
still
gathering
the
material
together
and
stapling
it
in
a
private
room
next
to
a
tavern,
the
policeman
who
was
making
a
routine
check
of
the
tavern
came
in
and
he
saw
some
--
these
pamphlets
on
the
table
and
asked
whether
he
could
see
one
and
ashton
said,
“certainly.”
and
as
the
policeman
reached
for
one
ashton
put
his
hand
under
the
table
and
handed
him
a
different
topic.
the
policeman
brought
this
back
to
the
police
station
and
showed
it
to
the
police
chief
and
another
policeman
was
dispatched
to
pick
up
a
copy
of
the
pamphlet
the
following
morning.
the
following
morning,
the
second
policeman
came
and
he
asked
for
a
copy
and
received
one
in
exactly
the
same
manner.
i
believe
that
the
first
policeman
was
accompanied
by
another
so
that
possibly
three
policemen
have
received
copies
of
the
pamphlet.
now,
this
is
the
only
distribution,
the
only
proof
of
distribution
of
this
pamphlet
that
we
have
in
the
record.
the
attorney
general
says
that
it
--
and
it
indicates
the
copies
would
have
been
delivered
to
anybody
who
asked
for
them.
and
that
maybe
true,
that
maybe
a
permissible
inference
to
draw
or
it
seems
to
me
that
when
a
policeman
asks
for
something
he's
not
to
be
denied
as
the
public
ordinary
citizen
is.
but
in
any
event,
this
is
the
total
distribution.
now,
i
believe
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
the
--
the
implicit
doctrine
of
the
garrison
against
louisiana
case
in
which
it
said
that
there
must
be
some
harm
to
the
community,
some
threat
upon
to
the
community
or
to
it's
feeling
of
security
that
where
you
have
so
special,
so
private,
so
limited
a
distribution,
the
community
is
not
affected,
certainly
not
by
the
distribution
by
the
accused
himself,
by
ashton.
i
think
we
must
carry
that
constitutional
doctrine
to
saying
not
only
must
the
making
of
the
statement,
that
is
the
writing
of
the
statement
be
with
knowledge
of
falsity
or
being
malicious
but
that
the
publication
must
be
also
and
that
the
publication
must
be
in
such
ways
to
affect
the
community.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
delivery
under
these
circumstances,
under
compulsion,
ritual
compulsion
although
there
had
been
no
order
to
deliver
but
merely
request
--
mr.
ephraim
london
mimeographing
was
done
somewhere
in
hazard,
kentucky
possibly
in
that
same
room
where
the
pamphlets
were
being
gathered
together
and
stapled
at
the
time.
the
policeman
came
in
and
found.
i
should
add
that
the
day
after
the
second
policeman
came
in
and
received
a
copy,
a
warrant
was
sworn
out
by
the
sheriff
and
by
the
police
chief
and
mrs.
nolan,
and
they
went
up
and
confiscated
all
the
copies
of
the
pamphlet.
so
that
if
there
was
any
distribution
after
that
time,
it
was
done
by
the
police
itself
certainly
not
the
voluntary
act
of
ashton
that
there
was
any
distribution
prior
to
that
time,
we
don't
know
of
it
and
certainly
there
was
no
proof
in
the
record.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
doesn't
but
there
are
two
statements.
one,
to
the
effect
that
there
were
about
60
pamphlets
picked
up
and
another
completely
unrelated
statements
saying
that
there
were
some
300
copies.
i
would
gather
it
was
somewhere
between
60
and
300
copies
that
were
picked
up.
now,
this
case
also
presents
constitutional
issue
relating
to
the
proof
of
matters
that's
required.
the
nature
of
the
proof
required
where
a
person's
libel
to
public
officials,
certainly
we
haven't
any
question
that
two
of
these
officials,
two
of
the
persons
libeled,
the
high
sheriff
and
a
police
chief
were
public
officials.
and
although
it
may
not
be
necessary,
the
libels
related
to
the
performance
of
their
duties
unto
their
work
as
officials.
there
was
no
extrinsic
evidence
at
all
that
ashton
knew
that
the
material
was
false.
no
extrinsic
evidence
that
he
didn't
care
whether
or
not
it
was
false.
no
extrinsic
evidence
on
the
question
of
malice
at
all
except
that
all
three
of
the
person's
libeled
said,
“ashton
never
came
and
asked
me
whether
the
statements
were
true
because
if
he
had
i'd
have
told
him
that
they
weren't
true.”
i
think
this
is
an
indication
utmost
of
negligence,
of
a
failure
to
check
one
source
as
the
attorney
general
attacks
ashton
for
believing
the
strikers.
he
says
“he's
an
intelligent
fellow
and
educated.
he
should
have
checked.”
maybe
he
should
have.
maybe
a
good
newspaperman
or
a
good
reporter
would've
checked
the
primary
sources.
but
he
didn't.
this
is
not
an
indication
that
he
knew
or
that
he
didn't
care
whether
the
statements
were
false.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
jury
was
merely
told
that
they
had
to
find
malice.
i
think
that
charge
is
on
page
126
and
the
court
said,
“malice
is
an
essential
element
of
this
defense
--
of
this
offense.
it
was
the
duty
of
the
commonwealth
to
prove
that
the
defendant
maliciously,”
i
think
there
he
meant
with
ill
will,
maliciously
published
the
notes
in
the
mountain
strike
and
unless
they
so
believed
they
are
bound
to
define
the
defendant
not
guilty
elsewhere
in
the
charge.
he
does
say
that
this
material
should
be
false
and
known
to
be
false
although
he
doesn't
cons
--
he
doesn't
say
that
that
is
libel
--
that
is
malice
but
he
describes
it
as
being
part
of
the
libel
itself.
this
court
has
not
yet
passed
on
the
quantum
of
proof
or
the
nature
of
the
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ephraim
london
on
the
quantum
of
proof
or
the
nature
of
proof
that's
required
by
the
constitution
in
a
criminal
prosecution
for
libel.
but
i
believe
it's
implicit
in
the
decisions
of
the
court
that
there
must
be
affirmative
extrinsic
evidence.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
is
precisely
true
and
if
--
mr.
ephraim
london
exactly,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion
on
that
question,
it's
fairly
clear.
and
if
i
may
add
just
one
more
sentence,
the
attorney
general
says
“this
is
an
impossible
thing
to
prove.”
i
would
answer
negatively,
knowledge
of
falsity
i
would
say
that
that's
proved
in
every
perjury
prosecution
i've
ever
heard
off.
it
is
an
essential
element.
mr.
ephraim
london
may
i
just
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
say
one
thing
with
respect
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ephraim
london
(inaudible)
mr.
ephraim
london
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
steve
ashton
was
convicted
of
criminal
libel
in
kentucky
in
1963,
november
1963.
it
was
a
common
law
crime.
the
appeal,
the
original
conviction
which
was
in
the
circuit
court
hazard,
he
appealed
it
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
affirmed
the
conviction
with
three
of
the
southern
judges
dissenting.
the
sentence
which
was
imposed
by
the
jury
was
six
months
in
jail
and
a
fine
of
$3000.
at
the
time
ashton
was
convicted,
he
was
a
college
student
at
(inaudible).
he
had
come
to
hazard,
kentucky
as
a
result
of
hearing
some
television
scenes
and
television
programs
in
which
the
plight
of
some
striking
miners
were
shown.
hazard,
kentucky
and
perry
county
was
the
center
of
a
mining
area
where
there
had
been
a
prolonged
labor
dispute.
some
of
the
miners
in
that
area
were
on
strike
and
some
were
not.
now,
ashton
who'd
come
down
as
the
representative
of
a
student
committee,
he
was
bringing
food
and
clothing
down
for
the
strikingminers.
and
while
there,
he
wrote
a
report
on
what
was
happening,
and
it
was
to
be
sent
i
believe
mostly
to
his
friends
and
colleagues
and
perhaps
to
some
others
who
would
be
willing
to
help
the
miners.
this
report
which
was
called
“notes
on
a
mountain
strike”
--
mr.
ephraim
london
back
home
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
was
mimeographed
and
i
believe
it
was
to
be
sent
primarily
back
home.
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
was
to
secure
funds.
i
think
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
although
it
is
not
clear
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
it.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
it's
our
position
that
it
was
not
distributed
at
all.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
some
policemen
did
get
hold
of
it.
what
they
did
with
it,
we
don’t
know
but
we
don't
believe
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ephraim
london
it
never
got
to
that
point.
it
would
have
been
available
i
suppose
but
ashton
never
got
to
the
point
of
distributing
these
pamphlets.
mr.
ephraim
london
while
in
the
person
--
mr.
ephraim
london
to
two
or
three
policemen,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
that's
correct.
we
shall
raise
the
question
of
whether
that
was
in
fact
a
publication.
i
like
to
come
to
that
a
little
bit
later
if
i
may.
but
there
were
three
people
supposedly
libeled
in
this
report.
one
was
sam
luttrell,
police
chief
of
hazard,
another
was
charles
combs,
the
high
sheriff
of
perry
county,
and
the
third
was
mrs.
nolan,
the
co-publisher
of
the
local
newspaper,
the
hazard
herald.
now,
the
things
that
were
written
about
the
high
sheriff
and
the
police
chief
were
certainly
unflattering.
but
for
the
most
part,
they
were
completely
true.
now,
for
example
ashton
wrote
that
the
sheriff
had
been
indicted
for
manslaughter
while
he
was
still
acting
as
sheriff
and
that
was
perfectly
true.
and
he
said
that
the
sheriff
although
he
was
supposed
to
be
impartial
in
this
dispute
between
the
striking
and
non-striking
miners,
was
actually
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
mine
and
that
was
perfectly
true.
and
he
wrote
that
the
sheriff
had
beaten
up
a
boy
in
the
sheriff's
jail
so
badly
that
the
boy
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
and
that
the
boy
was
tear-gassed
while
in
jail,
that
the
sheriff
had
to
pay
a
judgment
to
the
boy
of
$5000.
now,
it
was
true
that
the
boy
was
beaten
up.
it
was
true
that
he
had
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
and
it
was
true
he
recovered
a
judgment
against
the
sheriff
of
$5000.
but
it
appears
the
sheriff
wasn't
there
at
the
time.
and
that
the
beating
was
probably
administered
by
some
subordinates
of
the
sheriff.
ashton
said
that
the
sheriff
probably
bought
off
the
jury
that
rendered
the
verdict.
that
was
not
true.
and
at
least
it
wasn't
true
that
he
bought
off
the
jury.
the
word
probably
was
put
in
but
certainly
the
inference
of
that
statement
was
false.
now,
the
statements
he
made
about
the
police
chief
were
also
unpleasant
and
also
for
the
most
part
true.
he
said
that
the
police
chief
had
a
policeman
in
his
staff
who
sympathized
with
the
striking
miners
and
that
man
had
had
his
life
threatened.
well,
not
only
was
that
true
but
the
one
who
passed
on
the
threat
was
the
police
chief
himself.
he
said
that
--
ashton
said
that
the
police
chief
was
holding
down
a
private
job
as
a
guard
and
that
that
was
against
the
law.
but
that
was
untrue.
the
police
chief
wasn't
holding
down
an
outside
job.
he
certainly
wasn't
violating
the
law
in
that
respect.
now,
the
statements
made
about
mrs.
nolan
didn't
impute
my
thinking
any
serious
wrong
and
in
any
event
i
believe
they
were
true
but
i'd
like
to
speak
of
them
later
if
there
is
sufficient
time.
ashton
was
tried
twice,
first
jury
disagreed
and
the
second
jury
by
a
12
--
by
a
10
to
2
verdict,
found
him
guilty.
and
as
i
said
before
it
was
the
jury
that
imposed
the
sentence.
mr.
ephraim
london
there
was
one
trial.
the
indictment
doesn't
specify
separate
counts.
it
merely
says
that
he
was
guilty
of
having
libeled
the
three
named
persons.
mr.
ephraim
london
no
special
verdict.
it
was
a
general
verdict
to
guilty
by
the
jury.
and
there
was
no
indication
of
whether
they
find
him
guilty
of
libeling
the
sheriff
or
the
police
chief
or
mrs.
nolan.
that
wasn't
separately
stated
or
made
clear.
and
point
of
fact
there
had
been
in
the
--
named
in
the
indictment
a
mr.
nolan
who
was
the
other
owner
of
the
hazard
herald
and
the
indictment
as
against
him
was
dismissed
for
lack
of
proof.
now,
the
criminal
law
--
criminal
libel
law
of
kentucky
as
it's
construed
in
this
case
by
kentucky's
highest
court,
we
submit
is
unconstitutional.
now,
the
entire
law
we
state,
not
as
it's
applied
in
this
case
but
the
law
itself
is
we
think
clearly
unconstitutional
because
it
makes
writing
a
crime
when
that
writing
concededly
doesn't
create
any
serious
danger
to
the
community
and
indeed
even
to
the
individuals
who
maybe
libeled.
it
punishes
as
a
crime,
speech
that
doesn't
in
anyway
affect
the
public
or
the
community
or
the
state.
now,
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
any
private
per
se
libeled
which
is
made
with
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
statements
are
untrue
is
a
crime.
in
kentucky
any
per
se
libel.
and
it
is
conceded
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
criminal
law
is
designed
primarily
to
redress
purely
private
injury.
if
i
can
read
from
the
attorney
general's
brief,
just
a
moment
at
page
16,
he
states
that
it's
admitted
that
some
defamatory
publications
at
it's
lowest
which
could
be
punished
as
a
crime
would
not
be
serious
in
impact
as
others.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
“it
is
admitted
that
the
kentucky
common
law
offense
is
designed
to
protect
individual
reputation.
and
a
similar
statement
is
made
on
page
3
of
his
brief.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
a
--
that
is
part
of
it.
it
begins
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
it
begins
at
page
121
i
believe.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
is
the
whole
of
the
definition.
the
court
says
that
that
was
cured
by
some
statements
at
other
points
of
the
charge
in
which
he
says
that
this
stuff
has
to
be,
these
statements
have
to
be
false
and
that
the
petitioner
ashton
would
have
to
know
that
they
were
false.
i
should
like
to
get
into
that
question
later
but
what
i'm
talking
about
now
is
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals'
latest
description
of
this
crime.
in
its
opinion
in
this
case,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
said,
"we
must
disregard
this
kind
of
statement
that
was
made
by
the
trial
judge
that
this
really
isn't
the
law
anymore,
it
isn't
even
constitutional.
but
there
were
other
elements
in
this
charge
which
were
perfectly
correct
and
we
say
that
the
law
now
is
that
the
private
defamation
can
be
punished."
now,
the
law
of
civil
libel
or
libels
per
se
in
kentucky
are
very,
very
broad
indeed
if
for
example
i
--
i
know
mr.
matthews,
the
attorney
general
of
kentucky
is
a
--
or
assistant
attorney
general
is
an
open
and
honest
and
a
candid
man.
but
if
i
were
to
say
he
is
a
hypocrite
knowing
that
to
be
untrue,
that
is
a
criminal
libel
in
kentucky
also
a
civil
libel.
if
i
were
to
say
assuming
about
his
ancestors,
it
was
unpleasant,
even
if
they
were
dead,
two
or
three
or
four
generations,
i'm
guilty
of
a
criminal
libel
in
kentucky.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
it
has
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
law
is
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
doctrine
still
has
any
validity
that
one
cannot
make
any
writing
or
speech
or
communication
criminal
unless
it
presents
some
serious
danger
to
the
community.
and
as
i
understand
the
garrison
case,
i
understand
it
to
mean
that
a
libel
must
somehow
seriously
disturb
the
security
of
the
community
before
it
maybe
punished
as
a
crime.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
conviction
was
some
200
years
after
george
washington's
death.
mr.
ephraim
london
in
kentucky?
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
a
statute
relating
to
slander
but
this
is
a
common
law
offense.
mr.
ephraim
london
in
kentucky,
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
first
case
came
about
1888
in
which
they
suddenly
punished
someone.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
the
legislative
body
never
did
although
i
suppose
it
recognized
the
existence
of
this
as
a
common
law
crime
and
providing
for
general
punishment
under
a
statute
limiting
the
punishment
to
a
year
and
$5000
fine.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor
there
are.
mr.
ephraim
london
to
my
little
knowledge
of
kentucky
law,
i
think
the
majority
of
crimes.
mr.
ephraim
london
--
there
are
common
law
crimes.
mr.
ephraim
london
now,
the
attorney
general
of
kentucky
concedes
that
very
trifling
personal
abuse
can
be
punished
as
a
crime
in
kentucky.
but
he
says
that's
not
an
objection
to
the
law
because
the
jury
although
it
can
imprison
the
man
for
a
year
for
this
trifling
insult
and
can
fine
him
for
$5000
may
also
impose
a
very
small
punishment
even
if
a
dollar
fine
then
make
the
punishment
of
that
crime.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
provision
in
the
constitution
which
says
the
truth
maybe
proved
in
a
libel
case
because
under
the
common
law
in
england
as
your
honor
knows,
truth
was
not
a
defense.
the
constitution
doesn't
indicate
that
it's
a
clear
and
complete
defense
whether
it
says
it
can
be
proved.
and
i
believe
that
the
court
in
it's
clause
on
this
constitutional
provision
has
indicated
that
it
is
a
complete
defense.
i
think
that
certainly
in
this
case
there's
no
question
but
that
the
statement
has
to
be
false
in
order
to
be
punishable
as
a
crime.
and
the
truth
is
a
complete
defense.
mr.
ephraim
london
false
in
the
sense
that
it
is
untrue,
that
it's
contrary
to
fact.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
misstatement
of
the
facts.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
goes
even
further
by
the
way
in
including
opinion
although
that's
not
involved
here
because
i
think
to
say
that
one
is
a
hypocrite
is
an
opinion
rather
than
a
statement
of
fact
although
it
may
also
be
a
fact.
but
if
i
may
continue,
the
question
i
think
suggest
itself
if
every
libel
per
se
is
known
to
be
false
is
punishable
as
a
crime,
when
does
the
government
decide
what
cases
are
going
to
be
punished
as
a
crime
and
in
what
cases
does
the
kentucky
government
leave
the
individual
to
his
--
who
has
been
--
who
has
been
liable
to
his
civil
remedy
of
action
for
damages.
and
the
attorney
general
suggests
an
answer
in
his
brief.
he
indicates
that
criminal
libel
prosecution
is
appropriate
with
a
person
who
utters
a
libel
has
no
funds.
in
short,
it
maybe
a
crime
when
a
man
is
penniless
that
is
the
libel
of
it.
but
when
he
has
fines
with
which
to
respond
in
damages
then
the
inclination
of
the
government
would
be
to
leave
him
or
leave
the
man
liable
to
a
civil
remedy
in
damages.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
this
is
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
ephraim
london
may
i
read
at
page
20
of
his
brief.
and
they
say
this
is
a
suggestion.
mr.
ephraim
london
he
says,
“the
view
that
private
libel
and
personal
calumny
is
no
longer
appropriate
for
penal
control
as
unsound.
the
civil
suit
for
damages
may
be
an
adequate
threat
to
deter
deliberate
or
reckless
character
assassination
on
the
part
of
responsible
publisher
of
means
but
it
cannot
serve
the
guarantee
relief
from
this
positive
evil
in
the
case
of
those
who
were
immune
to
judgment
by
virtue
of
being
of
insufficient
worth.”
then
he
goes
on,
“the
threat
of
remedy
immediately
and
inexpensively
available
by
a
criminal
prosecution
is
an
effective
determine
--
deterrent
to
the
commission
of
such
a
real
harm."
in
other
words,
you
know,
we
can't
deter
a
fellow
who
has
money
because
--
but
we
have
to
worry
about
the
fellow
who
doesn't
have
money
and
who
goes
around
libeling
people.
and
the
only
way
we
can
deter
him
is
by
this
threat
of
criminal
prosecution.
now,
i
think
making
it
a
crime
where
a
man
is
penniless
and
a
civil
wrong
where
the
man
has
funds
doesn't
exactly
square
with
our
notions
of
equal
justice
to
the
indigent.
by
the
way,
a
similar
statement
to
the
one
that
i
just
referred
is
made
again
at
the
brief
in
the
introduction
where
the
attorney
general
writes
--
although
the
prevention
of
peace
--
of
the
--
or
breach
of
the
peace
is
no
longer
a
basis
for
criminality.
private
libel
should
be
subject
to
penal
sanctions
under
the
kentucky
common
law
in
order
to
deter
the
commission
of
harm
disturbing
the
community
sense
of
security
such
as
malicious
character
assassination
by
publication
of
calculated
falsehoods
by
impecunious
persons.
that's
at
page
3
of
the
brief.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
but
the
law
is
designed
and
the
attorney
general
has
indicated
in
order
to
protect
the
community
against
this
penniless
fellow
who
goes
around
insulting
people.
after
all,
the
judgment
against
him
isn't
much
good.
and
that's
why
it
covers
purely
private
personal
abuse
and
speaking
of
the
rationale
of
the
law
and
as
the
attorney
general's
concept,
its
application.
i
think
there's
another
answer
to
the
question
of
when
this
criminal
penalty
will
be
invoked
and
when
they
will
leave
the
individual
who
was
libeled
to
his
private
remedy
of
action
for
damages.
i
think
the
answer
is
suggested
by
this
case
because
criminal
libel
is
a
rare
prosecution
in
kentucky
as
elsewhere
in
the
united
states.
but
i
think
that
where
the
person
attacked
is
a
government
officer
with
the
power
to
initiate
the
criminal
prosecution,
you
are
very
likely
to
have
the
law
used
to
punish
the
personal
upfront
to
him.
i
think
most
of
the
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
have
been
cases
where
an
officer
of
the
law
who
had
the
power
to
initiate
criminal
prosecution,
the
one
who
did
it.
i
don't
think
we've
had
cases
in
this
court
in
which
a
purely
personal
upfront
to
a
private
individual
has
been
prosecuted
as
a
criminal
libel
and
then
brought
up.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
case
was
tried
before
new
york
times
against
garrison
but
the
appeal
was
heard
after
new
york
times
against
garrison
and
one
sees
the
references
to
that
case
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
this
court's
opinion
in
times
against
ga
--
sullivan
and
in
garrison
against
cox
was
the
reason
for
the
--
for
a
change
in
the
law
of
kentucky
that
was
made
by
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
but
i
shall
get
to
that
later
i
hope.
now,
we
do
have
another
related
question
relating
to
publication
and
to
the
question
that
was
asked
before
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
whether
or
not
this
pamphlet
was
ever
distributed
in
the
community.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
they
--
i
don't
remember
anything
that
the
court
says
nece
--
with
respect
to
the
showing
of
public
damage.
i
think
that
there's
a
reference
to
a
browning
case
in
which
they
had
--
i
think
it
was
browning
where
there
had
been
the
libeling
of
a
public
official
that
or
least
one
of
the
early
cases,
there
was
a
libeling
of
a
public
official.
and
the
court
as
i
said
in
its
opinion
has
indicated
that
the
rule
of
the
sullivan
case
now
applies
in
kentucky
namely
that
malice
has
to
be
shown,
that's
another
question
that
i'd
like
to
get
to
in
just
a
moment.
but
returning
to
the
question
of
publication,
what
happened
here
is
that
while
ashton
was
still
gathering
the
material
together
and
stapling
it
in
a
private
room
next
to
a
tavern,
the
policeman
who
was
making
a
routine
check
of
the
tavern
came
in
and
he
saw
some
--
these
pamphlets
on
the
table
and
asked
whether
he
could
see
one
and
ashton
said,
“certainly.”
and
as
the
policeman
reached
for
one
ashton
put
his
hand
under
the
table
and
handed
him
a
different
topic.
the
policeman
brought
this
back
to
the
police
station
and
showed
it
to
the
police
chief
and
another
policeman
was
dispatched
to
pick
up
a
copy
of
the
pamphlet
the
following
morning.
the
following
morning,
the
second
policeman
came
and
he
asked
for
a
copy
and
received
one
in
exactly
the
same
manner.
i
believe
that
the
first
policeman
was
accompanied
by
another
so
that
possibly
three
policemen
have
received
copies
of
the
pamphlet.
now,
this
is
the
only
distribution,
the
only
proof
of
distribution
of
this
pamphlet
that
we
have
in
the
record.
the
attorney
general
says
that
it
--
and
it
indicates
the
copies
would
have
been
delivered
to
anybody
who
asked
for
them.
and
that
maybe
true,
that
maybe
a
permissible
inference
to
draw
or
it
seems
to
me
that
when
a
policeman
asks
for
something
he's
not
to
be
denied
as
the
public
ordinary
citizen
is.
but
in
any
event,
this
is
the
total
distribution.
now,
i
believe
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
the
--
the
implicit
doctrine
of
the
garrison
against
louisiana
case
in
which
it
said
that
there
must
be
some
harm
to
the
community,
some
threat
upon
to
the
community
or
to
it's
feeling
of
security
that
where
you
have
so
special,
so
private,
so
limited
a
distribution,
the
community
is
not
affected,
certainly
not
by
the
distribution
by
the
accused
himself,
by
ashton.
i
think
we
must
carry
that
constitutional
doctrine
to
saying
not
only
must
the
making
of
the
statement,
that
is
the
writing
of
the
statement
be
with
knowledge
of
falsity
or
being
malicious
but
that
the
publication
must
be
also
and
that
the
publication
must
be
in
such
ways
to
affect
the
community.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
delivery
under
these
circumstances,
under
compulsion,
ritual
compulsion
although
there
had
been
no
order
to
deliver
but
merely
request
--
mr.
ephraim
london
mimeographing
was
done
somewhere
in
hazard,
kentucky
possibly
in
that
same
room
where
the
pamphlets
were
being
gathered
together
and
stapled
at
the
time.
the
policeman
came
in
and
found.
i
should
add
that
the
day
after
the
second
policeman
came
in
and
received
a
copy,
a
warrant
was
sworn
out
by
the
sheriff
and
by
the
police
chief
and
mrs.
nolan,
and
they
went
up
and
confiscated
all
the
copies
of
the
pamphlet.
so
that
if
there
was
any
distribution
after
that
time,
it
was
done
by
the
police
itself
certainly
not
the
voluntary
act
of
ashton
that
there
was
any
distribution
prior
to
that
time,
we
don't
know
of
it
and
certainly
there
was
no
proof
in
the
record.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
doesn't
but
there
are
two
statements.
one,
to
the
effect
that
there
were
about
60
pamphlets
picked
up
and
another
completely
unrelated
statements
saying
that
there
were
some
300
copies.
i
would
gather
it
was
somewhere
between
60
and
300
copies
that
were
picked
up.
now,
this
case
also
presents
constitutional
issue
relating
to
the
proof
of
matters
that's
required.
the
nature
of
the
proof
required
where
a
person's
libel
to
public
officials,
certainly
we
haven't
any
question
that
two
of
these
officials,
two
of
the
persons
libeled,
the
high
sheriff
and
a
police
chief
were
public
officials.
and
although
it
may
not
be
necessary,
the
libels
related
to
the
performance
of
their
duties
unto
their
work
as
officials.
there
was
no
extrinsic
evidence
at
all
that
ashton
knew
that
the
material
was
false.
no
extrinsic
evidence
that
he
didn't
care
whether
or
not
it
was
false.
no
extrinsic
evidence
on
the
question
of
malice
at
all
except
that
all
three
of
the
person's
libeled
said,
“ashton
never
came
and
asked
me
whether
the
statements
were
true
because
if
he
had
i'd
have
told
him
that
they
weren't
true.”
i
think
this
is
an
indication
utmost
of
negligence,
of
a
failure
to
check
one
source
as
the
attorney
general
attacks
ashton
for
believing
the
strikers.
he
says
“he's
an
intelligent
fellow
and
educated.
he
should
have
checked.”
maybe
he
should
have.
maybe
a
good
newspaperman
or
a
good
reporter
would've
checked
the
primary
sources.
but
he
didn't.
this
is
not
an
indication
that
he
knew
or
that
he
didn't
care
whether
the
statements
were
false.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
jury
was
merely
told
that
they
had
to
find
malice.
i
think
that
charge
is
on
page
126
and
the
court
said,
“malice
is
an
essential
element
of
this
defense
--
of
this
offense.
it
was
the
duty
of
the
commonwealth
to
prove
that
the
defendant
maliciously,”
i
think
there
he
meant
with
ill
will,
maliciously
published
the
notes
in
the
mountain
strike
and
unless
they
so
believed
they
are
bound
to
define
the
defendant
not
guilty
elsewhere
in
the
charge.
he
does
say
that
this
material
should
be
false
and
known
to
be
false
although
he
doesn't
cons
--
he
doesn't
say
that
that
is
libel
--
that
is
malice
but
he
describes
it
as
being
part
of
the
libel
itself.
this
court
has
not
yet
passed
on
the
quantum
of
proof
or
the
nature
of
the
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ephraim
london
on
the
quantum
of
proof
or
the
nature
of
proof
that's
required
by
the
constitution
in
a
criminal
prosecution
for
libel.
but
i
believe
it's
implicit
in
the
decisions
of
the
court
that
there
must
be
affirmative
extrinsic
evidence.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
is
precisely
true
and
if
--
mr.
ephraim
london
exactly,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion
on
that
question,
it's
fairly
clear.
and
if
i
may
add
just
one
more
sentence,
the
attorney
general
says
“this
is
an
impossible
thing
to
prove.”
i
would
answer
negatively,
knowledge
of
falsity
i
would
say
that
that's
proved
in
every
perjury
prosecution
i've
ever
heard
off.
it
is
an
essential
element.
mr.
ephraim
london
may
i
just
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
say
one
thing
with
respect
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ephraim
london
