mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
steve
ashton,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
came
to
perry
county,
kentucky
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
serious
labor
versus
capital
dispute
with
considerable
violence
involved,
shootings
and
dynamiting
and
bitter
feelings
in
the
community.
he
came
of
course
for
a
most
commendable
purpose
to
bring
food
and
clothing
to
those
who
were
in
need.
and
in
this,
he
could
not
be
found
at
fault.
but
while
he
was
there,
he
determined
to
cast
his
luck
entirely
with
the
striking
miners
who
were
not
authorized
in
their
strike
by
the
united
mine
workers
and
they
were
operating
a
wildcat
strike.
and
he
cast
his
luck
with
them
and
decided
to
write
a
pamphlet
which
favored
their
side
of
the
controversy
and
maligned
and
defamed
the
officials
who
were
in
charge
of
enforcing
the
law
in
that
community.
had
he
merely
presented
the
truth
in
his
pamphlet,
it
would
have
been
of
value
from
a
social
standpoint
and
would've
been
fully
--
certainly
within
the
protection
of
the
guarantee
in
the
first
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
however,
he
decided
that
in
order
to
accomplish
the
end
which
he
thought
was
beneficial,
he
would
resort
to
defamatory
and
false
and
reckless
--
recklessly
false
statements
regarding
these
officials
that
they
were
liable
as
per
se
there
can
be
no
doubt.
he
charged
the
chief
of
police
of
this
city
that
he
himself
had
violated
the
law
by
taking
a
private
job
on
the
side.
this
was
admittedly
false
and
was
shown
to
be
so.
he
imputed
in
his
pamphlet
to
this
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
city
that
he
was
involved
himself
in
a
plot
to
assassinate
the
only
pro-strike
policeman
on
this
force.
it
was
shown
that
in
fact
the
chief
of
police
was
not
involved
in
such
a
plot
personally,
if
there
was
such
a
plot.
he
said
of
the
sheriff
that
the
sheriff
had
been
fined
for
intentionally
beating
and
blinding
a
boy
who
was
helplessly
handcuffed
in
his
jail.
the
facts
of
the
matter
were
the
sheriff
was
not
even
present.
he
was
not
fined.
he
did
not
intentionally
beat
this
boy.
now,
it
is
said
that
there
was
substantial
proof
to
this
because
in
fact
the
sheriff
had
subsequently
been
held
liable
in
damages
in
a
civil
action
for
an
instant
regarding
this
boy
that
took
place
in
his
jail.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
the
statement
that
the
sheriff
personally
intentionally
beat
this
helpless
boy.
one
maybe
held
liable
under
bonds
for
the
acts
of
his
deputies.
but
to
say
that
it's
a
different
proposition
and
to
say
that
the
principle
himself
personally
and
intentionally
committed
this.
he
said
to
the
sheriff
that
he
had
bought
off
the
jury.
this
was
not
true.
he
said
that
the
sheriff
--
that
he
was
fighting
the
pickets
and
the
sheriff
denied
this.
these
statements
concerning
the
two
public
officials
charged
them
as
being
felons
and
violators
of
the
law
and
unworthy
and
degraded
persons.
the
statements
about
the
newspaper,
co-owner
and
publisher
of
the
hazard
herald
imputed
to
her
breach
of
a
public
trust
and
that
she
was
suppose
to
have
received
from
the
public
as
a
result
of
a
television
show,
contributions
to
be
devoted
solely
to
the
benefit
of
these
pickets
involved
in
the
wildcat
strike
in
the
coal
field.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
two
television
programs,
and
the
first
one
on
which
this
fund
was
developed
and
on
which
it
began
was
concerned
with
a
miller
family
who
were
farmers
and
the
general
theory
of
the
program
was
“help
the
needy
people.”
the
contributions
coming
in
were
not
earmarked
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
the
pickets
but
were
to
be
used
for
the
needy
persons
and
they
were
so
used
under
the
directions
of
the
government
--
of
the
governor
of
the
state
of
kentucky.
all
of
these
funds
and
clothing
which
he
received
were
distributed
to
needy
persons
throughout
the
community.
it
was
said
of
mrs.
nolan
that
she
was
vehemently
against
labor
in
this
controversy.
she
not
only
denied
this
but
stated
that
her
own
father
had
been
an
underground
miner
in
the
coal
fields
that
her
uncle
had
been
killed
working
in
the
coal
field
that
she
was
sympathetic
with
labor
that
her
own
husband
was
a
member
of
the
typographical
typesetters
union.
she
stated
that
her
newspaper
had
tried
to
promote
peace
and
harmony
in
this
community
in
this
bitter
struggle.
she
stated
that
she
had
tried
to
play
down
violence
and
tried
to
remove
the
threat
of
violence
in
the
community.
these
statements
about
mrs.
nolan
were
so
--
shown
to
be
substantially
false.
it
was
stated
that
none
of
the
food
and
clothing
went
to
the
pickets
when
mrs.
nolan
stated
that
out
of
14
truckloads
of
food
and
clothing,
two
truckloads
at
the
outset
went
to
the
pickets.
now,
these
matters
concerned
the
reputation
of
these
persons
and
if
we
take
the
position
that
reputation
of
individuals
is
no
longer
of
any
importance
then
certainly
this
conviction
cannot
stand
but
i
submit
that
it
is
a
vital
thing
to
all
of
us.
the
crimes
of
extortion
and
blackmail
frequently
depend
on
a
person's
concern
for
his
own
reputation.
and
he
would
go
to
great
lengths
to
protect
that.
mr.
john
b.
browning
of
the
perry
county
as
a
whole?
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
it's
about
39,000
something
in
that
vicinity.
mr.
john
b.
browning
hazard,
i
believe,
it
was
between
6000
to
9000.
mr.
john
b.
browning
between
that
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
browning
he
live
in
hazard,
i
think.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
believe
that
his
wife
run
for
office.
since
that
time
i
don't
think
that
the
sheriff
has
these,
or
he
can't
succeed
himself
of
course.
mr.
john
b.
browning
he
cannot
succeed
himself,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
do
not
know.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
sheriff
did
testify
that
he
thought
that
he
still
had
the
support
of
the
rich
and
poor
in
the
county.
but
he
did
feel
that
this
matter
had
hurt
him
because
people
only
know
what
they
read
and
they
wonder
about
it
and
they
have
been
asking
him
questions.
and
furthermore
outside
of
the
county
where
he
was
not
known
where
this
material
was
to
be
sent,
he
felt
that
it
damaged
him
a
great
deal.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we're
concerned
with
libel
per
se,
the
question
is
whether
the
words
by
themselves
would
damage
a
person's
reputation
and
we
cannot
in
every
case
get
into
the
question
of
what
harm
has
actually
resulted.
this
libel
is
similar
to
obscene
literature
in
that
we
have
here
a
certain
well-defined
and
limited
classes
of
speech,
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
which
have
never
been
thought
to
raise
any
constitutional
problems.
now,
if
i
might
at
this
point
discuss
the
history
of
the
common
law
offense,
kentucky
takes
it's
common
law
from
virginia
by
a
constitutional
provision
to
the
effect
that
all
laws
enforced
in
virginia
on
june
the
1st,
9th
--
1792
when
kentucky
became
a
state
or
enforcing
kentucky
unless
repugnant
to
the
constitution
or
otherwise
changed
by
statute.
when
kentucky
became
a
state
in
1792,
our
constitution
changed
the
old
english
law
of
criminal
libel
by
incorporating
one
provision
of
facts
of
libel
act
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
shall
decide
both
the
law
and
the
facts
and
that
means
that
they
shall
decide
whether
the
matter
is
libelous.
also
our
constitution
provided
in
1792
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
maybe
given
in
evidence
where
it
concerns
public
officials
and
matters
of
public
importance.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
chief
justice,
obviously,
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
could
only
speculate
at
most
as
to
what
was
in
the
minds
of
these
jurors
who
returned
the
verdict.
certainly,
the
record
doesn't
revealing
it
--
reveal
it
and
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
it.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
court
of
appeals
had
that
question
presented
to
it
and
decided
that
a
verdict
agreed
upon
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
be
made
on
a
majority
vote
could
be
sustained.
i
did
not
think
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
it
is
true
mr.
chief
justice
that
they
could
not
have
split
up
in
that
fashion
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
did
that.
i
think
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
they
were
required
by
the
instructions
to
find
these
matters
were
libelous
and
false
and
known
to
be
false
as
to
all
three
of
these
parties.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
i
think
the
instructions
in
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
were
asked
to
all
three
of
them.
mr.
john
b.
browning
if
the
jury
believed
in
the
evidence,
this
is
on
page
122.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it's
the
principle
instruction
in
the
case.
if
the
jury
believed
in
the
evidence
to
the
exclusion
of
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
ex
--
accused,
steve
ashton
in
unlawfully
published
in
a
pamphlet
certain
libelous
and
defamatory
matter,
the
following
libelous
and
defamatory
matter
concerning
luttrell
and
also
concerning
charles
combs
and
concerning
nolan
wherein
they
were
presented
to
the
public
as
a
felon,
a
violator
of
the
law
and
is
being
degraded
non-worthy
individuals,
were
held
of
to
ridicule
and
contempt.
and
that
these
words
in
said
articles
were
false
and
libelous
and
were
so
known
to
be
false
and
libelous
when
published
by
the
defendant
and
were
written
by
him
for
the
purpose
of
injuring
all
three
of
these
parties.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
three
of
them
are
covered
in
the
instruction.
mr.
john
b.
browning
trans
for
the
instruction
begins,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
page
122
of
the
record.
mr.
john
b.
browning
and
extends
to
page
125.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it's
not
in
the
alternative.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
the
requirement
is
the
jury
must
find
that
all
three
of
them
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
all
three
of
them
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
what
they
were
required
to
believe.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes.
mr.
john
b.
browning
they
have
not.
this
is
a
--
in
a
criminal
case
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
oh,
mr.
justice,
in
a
criminal
case
the
fine
goes
to
the
treasury
of
the
commonwealth.
they
--
for
and
--
no
portion
of
the
fine
recovered
goes
to
the
benefit
of
the
parties
injured.
that
distinguishes
the
criminal
prosecution
from
civil.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
decisions
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
beginning
in
the
year
1888,
evidence
that
the
offense
at
common
law
and
that
state
consisted
of
four
elements,
publication
of
course,
falsity
of
course
and
malice
and
the
words
must
be
defamatory
per
se,
that
is
in
themselves.
they
must
have
a
tendency
to
bring
somebody
into
contempt
and
ridicule
and
injure
their
reputation
by
imputing
to
them
as
for
example
the
commission
of
a
crime.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
is
the
first
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
is
the
first
appellate
opinion
that
i've
been
able
to
find
mr.
justice.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
first
time
it
has
come
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
b.
browning
tracy
versus
commonwealth.
mr.
john
b.
browning
tracy
versus
commonwealth.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
is
cited
in
my
brief
at
page
7.
mr.
john
b.
browning
in
that
initial
case
in
1888
there
was
a
question
raised
by
the
defendant
concerning
the
definition
of
the
offense
and
after
setting
out
the
elements
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
held
that
this
constitute
a
complete
offense
and
apprise
the
defendant
of
every
fact
necessary
to
constitute
crime.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
was
a
libel
of
public
officials.
the
defendant
caused
that
an
article
to
be
published
in
a
newspaper
in
lexington
in
which
he
made
statements
about
the
sheriff
which
if
true
would
make
him
a
corrupt
official.
he
also
made
statements
about
the
jury
but
the
appellate
opinion
does
not
reveal
what
they
might
have
been
and
the
appellate
opinion
states
that
the
statements
about
the
judge
was
that
he
took
the
matter
from
the
jury
in
a
condemnation
suit.
mr.
john
b.
browning
of
a
sheriff
and
a
judge.
and
in
the
next
kentucky
case
decided
in
1895,
seven
years
later,
smith
versus
commonwealth
which
is
on
page
9
of
my
brief
where
you
find
that
there
is
no
longer
any
reference
to
breach
of
the
peace
as
a
justification
for
this
offense
or
as
a
part
of
the
definition
of
the
offense
or
an
element
of
it.
and
in
the
smith
case,
malice
was
equated
with
knowledge
--
knowledge
of
falsity
of
the
defamatory
statements.
and
this
seems
to
be
in
accord
with
the
--
or
the
ruling,
the
majority
of
this
court
in
garrison
versus
louisiana.
the
smith
case
was
used
in
instructing
the
jury
in
this
case
and
you
will
note
that
the
instructions
particularly
in
the
principal
instruction
were
patterned
after
the
appellate
report
in
smith
versus
commonwealth.
browning
versus
commonwealth
which
was
the
third
case,
came
--
that
came
before
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
in
1903
involved
apparently
a
purely
private
libel
which
was
unrelated
to
public
affairs.
and
this
necessarily
means
that
the
common
law
offense
in
kentucky
is
broad
enough
of
course
to
apply
to
private
parties
as
well
as
those
who
are
in
public
office
and
to
private
matters
as
well
as
those
concerning
public
affairs.
now,
the
most
modern
case
that
we
have
in
kentucky
was
decided
in
1927,
it
is
coal
versus
commonwealth.
there
the
newspaper
published
statements
about
a
circuit
judge
which
alleged
as
a
fact
that
he
had
cooperated
with
the
prosecution
and
visit
himself
with
getting
evidence
to
convict
three
defendants
who
were
charged
in
his
court
for
the
crime
of
rape.
the
newspaper
reporters
according
to
the
appellate
opinion
admitted
falsity
of
their
statements.
they
were
fined
$250
fees.
the
court
in
the
coal
case
pointed
out
that
certainly
it
was
permissible
under
the
privilege
of
fair
comment
for
the
press
and
members
of
the
public
to
criticize
and
comment
upon
the
acts
of
public
official
in
a
caustic
and
severe
manner
but
that
this
did
not
extend
to
statements
of
fact
which
were
defamatory
and
false.
the
coal
case,
our
most
modern
case
1927,
again
did
not
bring
in
breach
of
the
peace,
did
not
mentioned
it.
it
was
not
an
element
of
the
offense
obviously.
the
definition
never
included
it.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
don't
think
the
common
law
of
kentucky
makes
any
distinction
mr.
justice.
i
believe
that
i
will
have
to
agree
with
the
learned
counsel
on
the
other
side.
the
law
in
kentucky
is
broad
enough
to
include
private
as
well
as
public
matters.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
on
the
basis
of
individual
reputation.
obviously,
this
common
law
offense
does
not
result
in
any
breach
of
the
peace.
that
does
not
have
to
be
shown,
that's
clear
and
the
whole
thing
protected
here
is
individual
reputation.
now,
certainly
we
are
not
going
to
say
that
libel
as
utterances
as
a
general
classification
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment.
the
federal
constitution
as
made
applicable
to
the
states
for
the
fourteenth,
we
can't
make
that
argument
but
i
am
here
to
make
the
argument
that
this
kentucky
common
law
crime
satisfies
the
relevant
constitutional
standards
which
mr.
justice
brennan
set
out
in
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court
in
garrison
versus
louisiana.
mr.
john
b.
browning
instruction
3
alone
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
would
not
have
satisfied.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice,
instruction
3
should
not
have
been
given
in
this
case.
i'll
answer
your
question
by
saying
it
is
not
an
ultimate
ground.
our
case
is
that
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
and
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
is
entirely
superfluous.
it
is
obsolete.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice,
if
i
might
answer
your
question
in
this
fashion.
i
believe
that
the
court
first
instructed
as
to
the
four
essential
elements
of
the
offense.
publication
of
a
false
statement
with
malice
which
is
defamatory
per
se
then
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
then
proceeded
to
instruct
further.
and
our
argument
is
that
this
simply
required
the
jury
to
believe
an
additional
fact
which
was
not
required
to
be
shown
for
a
conviction
which
was
not
incumbent
on
the
prosecution
to
prove.
in
other
words,
the
jury
had
to
find
the
regular
elements
of
this
offense
as
they
had
been
defined
as
far
back
as
1895
in
our
decisions
and
then
they
were
required
by
this
third
separate
instruction
to
find
that
in
this
particular
case
the
impact
of
the
defamatory
words
were
such
as
to
create
a
breach
of
peace.
and
in
this
we
think
was
favorable
to
the
defendant
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
jury
had
to
find
this
additional
matter.
it
was
not
required
to
be
proved.
therefore,
no
harm
resulted,
mr.
justice,
to
the
petitioner
under
our
argument
because
this
maybe
considered
perhaps
a
fifth
element
to
be
proved
in
this
case
which
was
not
at
all
required
to
be
done.
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
would
hope
that
you
would
agree
sir.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice,
that
is
our
contention
that
he
received
by
the
instructions
more
than
he
was
entitled
to
and
the
prosecution
was
required
to
prove
more
than
they
had
to
do.
i
will
say
that
i
believe
that
in
this
case
the
evidence
did
fit
the
instruction
number
3.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
situation
of
this
labor
capital
struggle,
this
bitterness,
this
violence
were
such
that
these
statements
when
published
might
well
have
been
calculated
to
incite
a
breach
of
the
peace.
i
might
mention
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
coal
versus
commonwealth,
our
most
recent
case
decided
1927
there
is
a
situation
where
certainly
a
breach
of
the
peace
might
have
been
provoked
by
the
published
matter.
if
you
read
the
opinion
in
that
case,
there
was
a
question
of
legal
lynching,
farcical
trial
resulting
in
quick
trip
to
the
gallows
and
this
was
headline
news,
and
it
could've
been
a
breach
of
the
peace
but
the
court,
the
appellate
court
in
deciding
that
case
did
not
even
mention
breach
of
the
peace
as
an
element
of
the
offense
or
even
in
the
definition
of
it.
it
was
completely
superfluous.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
do
not
agree
with
that
statement.
i
believe
there
is
testimony
by
a
person
who
served
on
the
miners
relief
fund
and
he
was
asked
if
down
at
the
beer
tavern
where
this
boy
was
distributing
these
pamphlets,
if
it
were
not
true
that
some
of
these
people
had
read
the
pamphlet
and
i
--
in
my
recollection
and
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
he
said,
“yes,
they
had
read
it.”
and
of
course
it
would
be
logical
that
they
would.
they
were
all
sitting
around
there.
that
material
was
packed
by
the
hundreds
on
the
top
of
this
table
in
this
beer
tavern
and
i
might
say
about
the
two
officers
now
that
it
--
it
is
a
wrong
impression
to
say
that
they
went
in
there
and
forced
this
boy
to
give
them
these
pamphlets.
they
went
into
the
tavern
on
a
purely
routine
inspection.
they
did
this
every
night
at
a
whirl
as
a
regular
patrol
to
check
for
disturbances.
when
they
went
in
on
this
evening
four
days
after
the
publication
was
written,
they
saw
hundreds
of
pamphlets
on
the
table
and
then
in
a
curious
fashion,
the
record
shows
that
they
asked,
“what
is
that?"
the
reply
was
“reading
matter.”
their
testimony
certainly
is
that
the
boy
said,
“would
you
like
one?”
and
he
urged
them
to
take
it
and
read
it,
take
it
home
with
them
and
read
it.
and
certainly,
the
record
tends
to
show
that
that
was
not
involuntary
and
the
publication
was
to
them.
now,
they
went
back
and
showed
it
to
the
chief
of
police
when
he
came
on
duty
the
next
morning
and
then
he
sent
a
policeman
down
there
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
getting
a
copy
of
it.
but
prior
to
that,
the
officers
received
voluntary
--
voluntarily
from
this
boy
and
urged
upon
them
this
pamphlet.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice,
the
board
had
not
testified.
therefore,
he
could
not
be
asked
if
he
knew
the
statements
were
false.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
only
evidence
to
show
acts
of
malice
was
that
there
was
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth
and
that
evidence
was
that
he
was
a
stranger
in
this
community
and
that
he
cited
and
stayed
with
only
one
faction
and
that
he
did
not
even
come
around
and
say
anything
to
the
newspaper
publisher
to
the
sheriff,
to
the
chief
of
police.
and
they
testified
that
had
he
made
even
the
faintest
attempt
to
talk
to
them,
they
would
have
been
most
happy
of
course.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
that
being
a
lesser
degree
mr.
justice
would
surely
be
contained
in
that
charge.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
agree
with
our
appellate
court
that
the
instructions
again
in
that
respect
were
most
favorable
to
petitioner
because
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
knew
that
these
statements
were
false.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
he
knew
they
were
false.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
would
have
to
be
that
it
was
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
proof
and
that
he
had
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
the
probable
falsity
of
these
statements.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
must
be
in
the
--
the
published
matter
itself
that
he
made
a
series
of
wild
and
reckless
allegations.
he
against
everyone,
he
attacked
every
law
enforcement
official.
he
started
with
the
chief
of
police
and
said
that
he
was
corrupt
and
a
law
violator.
he
went
on
to
the
sheriff
of
the
county,
he
went
on
to
the
state
police
and
said
that
they
were
in
cahoots
with
the
illegal
activities
of
the
murderous
and
crooked
mine
operators.
everyone
was
maligned
connected
with
the
law
and
they
all
knew
of
the
illegal
activities
of
the
operators
and
they
condoned
this
and
supported
it.
now,
these
statements
were
obviously
reckless.
what
about
this
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
what
about
the
statement
that
even
the
fbi
several
times
came
the
picket
lines
and
ignored
completely
the
illegal
activities
of
the
operators
of
which
they
were
well
aware
and
instead
harassed
and
intimidated
the
pickets.
this
could
not
be
so.
and
surely,
someone
writing
that
must
have
had
the
thought,
i
think
some
of
these
are
probably
false.
this
is
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
there
must
come
a
time
also
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
not
solely
your
honor
that
he
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
check
with
these
people
or
anyone
else
concerning
the
truth
of
these
statements.
mr.
john
b.
browning
absolutely.
they
said
that
they
have
not
even
heard
of
this
boy.
i
think
at
least
one
of
them
did.
all
three
of
them
said
that
he
never
at
anytime
came
around
and
(voice

--
mr.
john
b.
browning
reckless
nature
of
the
statements
of
the
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
plus
the
fact
that
he
was
a
complete
stranger
in
this
community.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
he
was
a
complete
stranger,
yes.
mr.
john
b.
browning
there
is
no
indication
as
to
precisely
where
he
got
it
but
he
stayed
at
the
home
of
one
of
the
strike
sympathizers,
herbert
stacey
whose
home
(voice

--
mr.
john
b.
browning
there
is
no
testimony
as
to
where
he
got
his
information,
exactly.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
there
is
a
definition
contained
in
the
principle
instruction
that's
found
on
page
123
of
the
record.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
he
made
false
and
defamatory
statements
presenting
these
persons
to
the
public
as
a
felon,
a
violator
of
the
law,
and
is
being
degraded
and
unworthy
persons
and
officials
and
that
they
were
held
up
to
ridicule
and
contempt.
and
this
is
a
standard
definition
which
has
been
employed
as
to
libel,
criminal
libel
in
all
of
the
appellate
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
b.
browning
no,
your
honor.
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
that
it's
covered
in
instruction
number
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
believe
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
does
not
precisely
say
this
is
the
definition
but
i
believe
that
it
uses
the
words
which
our
appellate
courts
has
always
said
was
the
definitions
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
browning
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
steve
ashton,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
came
to
perry
county,
kentucky
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
serious
labor
versus
capital
dispute
with
considerable
violence
involved,
shootings
and
dynamiting
and
bitter
feelings
in
the
community.
he
came
of
course
for
a
most
commendable
purpose
to
bring
food
and
clothing
to
those
who
were
in
need.
and
in
this,
he
could
not
be
found
at
fault.
but
while
he
was
there,
he
determined
to
cast
his
luck
entirely
with
the
striking
miners
who
were
not
authorized
in
their
strike
by
the
united
mine
workers
and
they
were
operating
a
wildcat
strike.
and
he
cast
his
luck
with
them
and
decided
to
write
a
pamphlet
which
favored
their
side
of
the
controversy
and
maligned
and
defamed
the
officials
who
were
in
charge
of
enforcing
the
law
in
that
community.
had
he
merely
presented
the
truth
in
his
pamphlet,
it
would
have
been
of
value
from
a
social
standpoint
and
would've
been
fully
--
certainly
within
the
protection
of
the
guarantee
in
the
first
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
however,
he
decided
that
in
order
to
accomplish
the
end
which
he
thought
was
beneficial,
he
would
resort
to
defamatory
and
false
and
reckless
--
recklessly
false
statements
regarding
these
officials
that
they
were
liable
as
per
se
there
can
be
no
doubt.
he
charged
the
chief
of
police
of
this
city
that
he
himself
had
violated
the
law
by
taking
a
private
job
on
the
side.
this
was
admittedly
false
and
was
shown
to
be
so.
he
imputed
in
his
pamphlet
to
this
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
city
that
he
was
involved
himself
in
a
plot
to
assassinate
the
only
pro-strike
policeman
on
this
force.
it
was
shown
that
in
fact
the
chief
of
police
was
not
involved
in
such
a
plot
personally,
if
there
was
such
a
plot.
he
said
of
the
sheriff
that
the
sheriff
had
been
fined
for
intentionally
beating
and
blinding
a
boy
who
was
helplessly
handcuffed
in
his
jail.
the
facts
of
the
matter
were
the
sheriff
was
not
even
present.
he
was
not
fined.
he
did
not
intentionally
beat
this
boy.
now,
it
is
said
that
there
was
substantial
proof
to
this
because
in
fact
the
sheriff
had
subsequently
been
held
liable
in
damages
in
a
civil
action
for
an
instant
regarding
this
boy
that
took
place
in
his
jail.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
the
statement
that
the
sheriff
personally
intentionally
beat
this
helpless
boy.
one
maybe
held
liable
under
bonds
for
the
acts
of
his
deputies.
but
to
say
that
it's
a
different
proposition
and
to
say
that
the
principle
himself
personally
and
intentionally
committed
this.
he
said
to
the
sheriff
that
he
had
bought
off
the
jury.
this
was
not
true.
he
said
that
the
sheriff
--
that
he
was
fighting
the
pickets
and
the
sheriff
denied
this.
these
statements
concerning
the
two
public
officials
charged
them
as
being
felons
and
violators
of
the
law
and
unworthy
and
degraded
persons.
the
statements
about
the
newspaper,
co-owner
and
publisher
of
the
hazard
herald
imputed
to
her
breach
of
a
public
trust
and
that
she
was
suppose
to
have
received
from
the
public
as
a
result
of
a
television
show,
contributions
to
be
devoted
solely
to
the
benefit
of
these
pickets
involved
in
the
wildcat
strike
in
the
coal
field.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
two
television
programs,
and
the
first
one
on
which
this
fund
was
developed
and
on
which
it
began
was
concerned
with
a
miller
family
who
were
farmers
and
the
general
theory
of
the
program
was
“help
the
needy
people.”
the
contributions
coming
in
were
not
earmarked
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
the
pickets
but
were
to
be
used
for
the
needy
persons
and
they
were
so
used
under
the
directions
of
the
government
--
of
the
governor
of
the
state
of
kentucky.
all
of
these
funds
and
clothing
which
he
received
were
distributed
to
needy
persons
throughout
the
community.
it
was
said
of
mrs.
nolan
that
she
was
vehemently
against
labor
in
this
controversy.
she
not
only
denied
this
but
stated
that
her
own
father
had
been
an
underground
miner
in
the
coal
fields
that
her
uncle
had
been
killed
working
in
the
coal
field
that
she
was
sympathetic
with
labor
that
her
own
husband
was
a
member
of
the
typographical
typesetters
union.
she
stated
that
her
newspaper
had
tried
to
promote
peace
and
harmony
in
this
community
in
this
bitter
struggle.
she
stated
that
she
had
tried
to
play
down
violence
and
tried
to
remove
the
threat
of
violence
in
the
community.
these
statements
about
mrs.
nolan
were
so
--
shown
to
be
substantially
false.
it
was
stated
that
none
of
the
food
and
clothing
went
to
the
pickets
when
mrs.
nolan
stated
that
out
of
14
truckloads
of
food
and
clothing,
two
truckloads
at
the
outset
went
to
the
pickets.
now,
these
matters
concerned
the
reputation
of
these
persons
and
if
we
take
the
position
that
reputation
of
individuals
is
no
longer
of
any
importance
then
certainly
this
conviction
cannot
stand
but
i
submit
that
it
is
a
vital
thing
to
all
of
us.
the
crimes
of
extortion
and
blackmail
frequently
depend
on
a
person's
concern
for
his
own
reputation.
and
he
would
go
to
great
lengths
to
protect
that.
mr.
john
b.
browning
of
the
perry
county
as
a
whole?
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
it's
about
39,000
something
in
that

hazard,
i
believe,
it
was
between
6000
to
9000.
mr.
john
b.
browning
between
that
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
browning
he
live
in
hazard,
i
think.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
believe
that
his
wife
run
for
office.
since
that
time
i
don't
think
that
the
sheriff
has
these,
or
he
can't
succeed
himself
of
course.
mr.
john
b.
browning
he
cannot
succeed
himself,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
do
not
know.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
sheriff
did
testify
that
he
thought
that
he
still
had
the
support
of
the
rich
and
poor
in
the
county.
but
he
did
feel
that
this
matter
had
hurt
him
because
people
only
know
what
they
read
and
they
wonder
about
it
and
they
have
been
asking
him
questions.
and
furthermore
outside
of
the
county
where
he
was
not
known
where
this
material
was
to
be
sent,
he
felt
that
it
damaged
him
a
great
deal.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we're
concerned
with
libel
per
se,
the
question
is
whether
the
words
by
themselves
would
damage
a
person's
reputation
and
we
cannot
in
every
case
get
into
the
question
of
what
harm
has
actually
resulted.
this
libel
is
similar
to
obscene
literature
in
that
we
have
here
a
certain
well-defined
and
limited
classes
of
speech,
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
which
have
never
been
thought
to
raise
any
constitutional
problems.
now,
if
i
might
at
this
point
discuss
the
history
of
the
common
law
offense,
kentucky
takes
it's
common
law
from
virginia
by
a
constitutional
provision
to
the
effect
that
all
laws
enforced
in
virginia
on
june
the
1st,
9th
--
1792
when
kentucky
became
a
state
or
enforcing
kentucky
unless
repugnant
to
the
constitution
or
otherwise
changed
by
statute.
when
kentucky
became
a
state
in
1792,
our
constitution
changed
the
old
english
law
of
criminal
libel
by
incorporating
one
provision
of
facts
of
libel
act
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
shall
decide
both
the
law
and
the
facts
and
that
means
that
they
shall
decide
whether
the
matter
is
libelous.
also
our
constitution
provided
in
1792
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
maybe
given
in
evidence
where
it
concerns
public
officials
and
matters
of
public
importance.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
chief
justice,
obviously,
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
could
only
speculate
at
most
as
to
what
was
in
the
minds
of
these
jurors
who
returned
the
verdict.
certainly,
the
record
doesn't
revealing
it
--
reveal
it
and
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
it.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
court
of
appeals
had
that
question
presented
to
it
and
decided
that
a
verdict
agreed
upon
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
be
made
on
a
majority
vote
could
be
sustained.
i
did
not
think
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
it
is
true
mr.
chief
justice
that
they
could
not
have
split
up
in
that
fashion
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
did
that.
i
think
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
they
were
required
by
the
instructions
to
find
these
matters
were
libelous
and
false
and
known
to
be
false
as
to
all
three
of
these
parties.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
i
think
the
instructions
in
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
were
asked
to
all
three
of
them.
mr.
john
b.
browning
if
the
jury
believed
in
the
evidence,
this
is
on
page
122.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it's
the
principle
instruction
in
the
case.
if
the
jury
believed
in
the
evidence
to
the
exclusion
of
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
ex
--
accused,
steve
ashton
in
unlawfully
published
in
a
pamphlet
certain
libelous
and
defamatory
matter,
the
following
libelous
and
defamatory
matter
concerning
luttrell
and
also
concerning
charles
combs
and
concerning
nolan
wherein
they
were
presented
to
the
public
as
a
felon,
a
violator
of
the
law
and
is
being
degraded
non-worthy
individuals,
were
held
of
to
ridicule
and
contempt.
and
that
these
words
in
said
articles
were
false
and
libelous
and
were
so
known
to
be
false
and
libelous
when
published
by
the
defendant
and
were
written
by
him
for
the
purpose
of
injuring
all
three
of
these
parties.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
three
of
them
are
covered
in
the
instruction.
mr.
john
b.
browning
trans
for
the
instruction
begins,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
page
122
of
the
record.
mr.
john
b.
browning
and
extends
to
page
125.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it's
not
in
the
alternative.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
the
requirement
is
the
jury
must
find
that
all
three
of
them
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
all
three
of
them
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
what
they
were
required
to
believe.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes.
mr.
john
b.
browning
they
have
not.
this
is
a
--
in
a
criminal
case
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
oh,
mr.
justice,
in
a
criminal
case
the
fine
goes
to
the
treasury
of
the
commonwealth.
they
--
for
and
--
no
portion
of
the
fine
recovered
goes
to
the
benefit
of
the
parties
injured.
that
distinguishes
the
criminal
prosecution
from
civil.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
decisions
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
beginning
in
the
year
1888,
evidence
that
the
offense
at
common
law
and
that
state
consisted
of
four
elements,
publication
of
course,
falsity
of
course
and
malice
and
the
words
must
be
defamatory
per
se,
that
is
in
themselves.
they
must
have
a
tendency
to
bring
somebody
into
contempt
and
ridicule
and
injure
their
reputation
by
imputing
to
them
as
for
example
the
commission
of
a
crime.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
is
the
first
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
is
the
first
appellate
opinion
that
i've
been
able
to
find
mr.
justice.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
first
time
it
has
come
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
b.
browning
tracy
versus
commonwealth.
mr.
john
b.
browning
tracy
versus
commonwealth.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
is
cited
in
my
brief
at
page
7.
mr.
john
b.
browning
in
that
initial
case
in
1888
there
was
a
question
raised
by
the
defendant
concerning
the
definition
of
the
offense
and
after
setting
out
the
elements
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
held
that
this
constitute
a
complete
offense
and
apprise
the
defendant
of
every
fact
necessary
to
constitute
crime.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
was
a
libel
of
public
officials.
the
defendant
caused
that
an
article
to
be
published
in
a
newspaper
in
lexington
in
which
he
made
statements
about
the
sheriff
which
if
true
would
make
him
a
corrupt
official.
he
also
made
statements
about
the
jury
but
the
appellate
opinion
does
not
reveal
what
they
might
have
been
and
the
appellate
opinion
states
that
the
statements
about
the
judge
was
that
he
took
the
matter
from
the
jury
in
a
condemnation
suit.
mr.
john
b.
browning
of
a
sheriff
and
a
judge.
and
in
the
next
kentucky
case
decided
in
1895,
seven
years
later,
smith
versus
commonwealth
which
is
on
page
9
of
my
brief
where
you
find
that
there
is
no
longer
any
reference
to
breach
of
the
peace
as
a
justification
for
this
offense
or
as
a
part
of
the
definition
of
the
offense
or
an
element
of
it.
and
in
the
smith
case,
malice
was
equated
with
knowledge
--
knowledge
of
falsity
of
the
defamatory
statements.
and
this
seems
to
be
in
accord
with
the
--
or
the
ruling,
the
majority
of
this
court
in
garrison
versus
louisiana.
the
smith
case
was
used
in
instructing
the
jury
in
this
case
and
you
will
note
that
the
instructions
particularly
in
the
principal
instruction
were
patterned
after
the
appellate
report
in
smith
versus
commonwealth.
browning
versus
commonwealth
which
was
the
third
case,
came
--
that
came
before
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
in
1903
involved
apparently
a
purely
private
libel
which
was
unrelated
to
public
affairs.
and
this
necessarily
means
that
the
common
law
offense
in
kentucky
is
broad
enough
of
course
to
apply
to
private
parties
as
well
as
those
who
are
in
public
office
and
to
private
matters
as
well
as
those
concerning
public
affairs.
now,
the
most
modern
case
that
we
have
in
kentucky
was
decided
in
1927,
it
is
coal
versus
commonwealth.
there
the
newspaper
published
statements
about
a
circuit
judge
which
alleged
as
a
fact
that
he
had
cooperated
with
the
prosecution
and
visit
himself
with
getting
evidence
to
convict
three
defendants
who
were
charged
in
his
court
for
the
crime
of
rape.
the
newspaper
reporters
according
to
the
appellate
opinion
admitted
falsity
of
their
statements.
they
were
fined
$250
fees.
the
court
in
the
coal
case
pointed
out
that
certainly
it
was
permissible
under
the
privilege
of
fair
comment
for
the
press
and
members
of
the
public
to
criticize
and
comment
upon
the
acts
of
public
official
in
a
caustic
and
severe
manner
but
that
this
did
not
extend
to
statements
of
fact
which
were
defamatory
and
false.
the
coal
case,
our
most
modern
case
1927,
again
did
not
bring
in
breach
of
the
peace,
did
not
mentioned
it.
it
was
not
an
element
of
the
offense
obviously.
the
definition
never
included
it.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
don't
think
the
common
law
of
kentucky
makes
any
distinction
mr.
justice.
i
believe
that
i
will
have
to
agree
with
the
learned
counsel
on
the
other
side.
the
law
in
kentucky
is
broad
enough
to
include
private
as
well
as
public
matters.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
on
the
basis
of
individual
reputation.
obviously,
this
common
law
offense
does
not
result
in
any
breach
of
the
peace.
that
does
not
have
to
be
shown,
that's
clear
and
the
whole
thing
protected
here
is
individual
reputation.
now,
certainly
we
are
not
going
to
say
that
libel
as
utterances
as
a
general
classification
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment.
the
federal
constitution
as
made
applicable
to
the
states
for
the
fourteenth,
we
can't
make
that
argument
but
i
am
here
to
make
the
argument
that
this
kentucky
common
law
crime
satisfies
the
relevant
constitutional
standards
which
mr.
justice
brennan
set
out
in
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court
in
garrison
versus
louisiana.
mr.
john
b.
browning
instruction
3
alone
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
would
not
have
satisfied.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice,
instruction
3
should
not
have
been
given
in
this
case.
i'll
answer
your
question
by
saying
it
is
not
an
ultimate
ground.
our
case
is
that
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
and
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
is
entirely
superfluous.
it
is
obsolete.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice,
if
i
might
answer
your
question
in
this
fashion.
i
believe
that
the
court
first
instructed
as
to
the
four
essential
elements
of
the
offense.
publication
of
a
false
statement
with
malice
which
is
defamatory
per
se
then
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
then
proceeded
to
instruct
further.
and
our
argument
is
that
this
simply
required
the
jury
to
believe
an
additional
fact
which
was
not
required
to
be
shown
for
a
conviction
which
was
not
incumbent
on
the
prosecution
to
prove.
in
other
words,
the
jury
had
to
find
the
regular
elements
of
this
offense
as
they
had
been
defined
as
far
back
as
1895
in
our
decisions
and
then
they
were
required
by
this
third
separate
instruction
to
find
that
in
this
particular
case
the
impact
of
the
defamatory
words
were
such
as
to
create
a
breach
of
peace.
and
in
this
we
think
was
favorable
to
the
defendant
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
jury
had
to
find
this
additional
matter.
it
was
not
required
to
be
proved.
therefore,
no
harm
resulted,
mr.
justice,
to
the
petitioner
under
our
argument
because
this
maybe
considered
perhaps
a
fifth
element
to
be
proved
in
this
case
which
was
not
at
all
required
to
be
done.
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
would
hope
that
you
would
agree
sir.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice,
that
is
our
contention
that
he
received
by
the
instructions
more
than
he
was
entitled
to
and
the
prosecution
was
required
to
prove
more
than
they
had
to
do.
i
will
say
that
i
believe
that
in
this
case
the
evidence
did
fit
the
instruction
number
3.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
situation
of
this
labor
capital
struggle,
this
bitterness,
this
violence
were
such
that
these
statements
when
published
might
well
have
been
calculated
to
incite
a
breach
of
the
peace.
i
might
mention
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
coal
versus
commonwealth,
our
most
recent
case
decided
1927
there
is
a
situation
where
certainly
a
breach
of
the
peace
might
have
been
provoked
by
the
published
matter.
if
you
read
the
opinion
in
that
case,
there
was
a
question
of
legal
lynching,
farcical
trial
resulting
in
quick
trip
to
the
gallows
and
this
was
headline
news,
and
it
could've
been
a
breach
of
the
peace
but
the
court,
the
appellate
court
in
deciding
that
case
did
not
even
mention
breach
of
the
peace
as
an
element
of
the
offense
or
even
in
the
definition
of
it.
it
was
completely
superfluous.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
do
not
agree
with
that
statement.
i
believe
there
is
testimony
by
a
person
who
served
on
the
miners
relief
fund
and
he
was
asked
if
down
at
the
beer
tavern
where
this
boy
was
distributing
these
pamphlets,
if
it
were
not
true
that
some
of
these
people
had
read
the
pamphlet
and
i
--
in
my
recollection
and
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
he
said,
“yes,
they
had
read
it.”
and
of
course
it
would
be
logical
that
they
would.
they
were
all
sitting
around
there.
that
material
was
packed
by
the
hundreds
on
the
top
of
this
table
in
this
beer
tavern
and
i
might
say
about
the
two
officers
now
that
it
--
it
is
a
wrong
impression
to
say
that
they
went
in
there
and
forced
this
boy
to
give
them
these
pamphlets.
they
went
into
the
tavern
on
a
purely
routine
inspection.
they
did
this
every
night
at
a
whirl
as
a
regular
patrol
to
check
for
disturbances.
when
they
went
in
on
this
evening
four
days
after
the
publication
was
written,
they
saw
hundreds
of
pamphlets
on
the
table
and
then
in
a
curious
fashion,
the
record
shows
that
they
asked,
“what
is
that?"
the
reply
was
“reading
matter.”
their
testimony
certainly
is
that
the
boy
said,
“would
you
like
one?”
and
he
urged
them
to
take
it
and
read
it,
take
it
home
with
them
and
read
it.
and
certainly,
the
record
tends
to
show
that
that
was
not
involuntary
and
the
publication
was
to
them.
now,
they
went
back
and
showed
it
to
the
chief
of
police
when
he
came
on
duty
the
next
morning
and
then
he
sent
a
policeman
down
there
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
getting
a
copy
of
it.
but
prior
to
that,
the
officers
received
voluntary
--
voluntarily
from
this
boy
and
urged
upon
them
this
pamphlet.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
sir.
mr.

mr.
justice,
the
board
had
not
testified.
therefore,
he
could
not
be
asked
if
he
knew
the
statements
were
false.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
only
evidence
to
show
acts
of
malice
was
that
there
was
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth
and
that
evidence
was
that
he
was
a
stranger
in
this
community
and
that
he
cited
and
stayed
with
only
one
faction
and
that
he
did
not
even
come
around
and
say
anything
to
the
newspaper
publisher
to
the
sheriff,
to
the
chief
of
police.
and
they
testified
that
had
he
made
even
the
faintest
attempt
to
talk
to
them,
they
would
have
been
most
happy
of
course.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
that
being
a
lesser
degree
mr.
justice
would
surely
be
contained
in
that
charge.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
agree
with
our
appellate
court
that
the
instructions
again
in
that
respect
were
most
favorable
to
petitioner
because
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
knew
that
these
statements
were
false.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
he
knew
they
were
false.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
would
have
to
be
that
it
was
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
proof
and
that
he
had
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
the
probable
falsity
of
these
statements.
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
must
be
in
the
--
the
published
matter
itself
that
he
made
a
series
of
wild
and
reckless
allegations.
he
against
everyone,
he
attacked
every
law
enforcement
official.
he
started
with
the
chief
of
police
and
said
that
he
was
corrupt
and
a
law
violator.
he
went
on
to
the
sheriff
of
the
county,
he
went
on
to
the
state
police
and
said
that
they
were
in
cahoots
with
the
illegal
activities
of
the
murderous
and
crooked
mine
operators.
everyone
was
maligned
connected
with
the
law
and
they
all
knew
of
the
illegal
activities
of
the
operators
and
they
condoned
this
and
supported
it.
now,
these
statements
were
obviously
reckless.
what
about
this
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
what
about
the
statement
that
even
the
fbi
several
times
came
the
picket
lines
and
ignored
completely
the
illegal
activities
of
the
operators
of
which
they
were
well
aware
and
instead
harassed
and
intimidated
the
pickets.
this
could
not
be
so.
and
surely,
someone
writing
that
must
have
had
the
thought,
i
think
some
of
these
are
probably
false.
this
is
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
there
must
come
a
time
also
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
not
solely
your
honor
that
he
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
check
with
these
people
or
anyone
else
concerning
the
truth
of
these
statements.
mr.
john
b.
browning
absolutely.
they
said
that
they
have
not
even
heard
of
this
boy.
i
think
at
least
one
of
them
did.
all
three
of
them
said
that
he
never
at
anytime
came
around
and
(voice

--
mr.
john
b.
browning
reckless
nature
of
the
statements
of
the
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
plus
the
fact
that
he
was
a
complete
stranger
in
this
community.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
he
was
a
complete
stranger,
yes.
mr.
john
b.
browning
there
is
no
indication
as
to
precisely
where
he
got
it
but
he
stayed
at
the
home
of
one
of
the
strike
sympathizers,
herbert
stacey
whose
home
(voice

--
mr.
john
b.
browning
there
is
no
testimony
as
to
where
he
got
his
information,
exactly.
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
there
is
a
definition
contained
in
the
principle
instruction
that's
found
on
page
123
of
the
record.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that
he
made
false
and
defamatory
statements
presenting
these
persons
to
the
public
as
a
felon,
a
violator
of
the
law,
and
is
being
degraded
and
unworthy
persons
and
officials
and
that
they
were
held
up
to
ridicule
and
contempt.
and
this
is
a
standard
definition
which
has
been
employed
as
to
libel,
criminal
libel
in
all
of
the
appellate
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
b.
browning
no,
your
honor.
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
that
it's
covered
in
instruction
number
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
believe
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
does
not
precisely
say
this
is
the
definition
but
i
believe
that
it
uses
the
words
which
our
appellate
courts
has
always
said
was
the
definitions
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
browning
thank
you
your
honor.
