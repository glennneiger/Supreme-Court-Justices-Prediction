chief
justice
earl

i
don't
know
if
it's
material
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
noticed
that
the
indictment
is
very
general.
it
merely
says
on
or
about
the
22nd
day
of
march
1963
in
perry
county,
kentucky,
the
above
named
defendant
committed
the
offense
of
criminal
libel
by
punishing
--
publishing
a
false
and
malicious
publication
which
tends
to
degrade
or
injure
sam
l.
luttrell,
charles
e.
combs,
mr.
and
mrs.
w.p.
nolan
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
i
understand
that
the
jury
found
10
to
2
against
him.
how
do
we
know
that
three
of
the
jurors
didn't
believe
that
mr.
luttrell
was
libeled
but
they
libeled
--
but
they
did
believe
that
mrs.
nolan
was
libeled
and
how
do
we
know
that
three
more
of
them
didn't
believe
that
she
wasn't
libeled
that
--
but
that
mr.
luttrell
was
and
how
do
we
know
that
the
rest
of
them
either
decided
the
case
on
whether
or
not
mr.
combs
was
libeled
but
not
the
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
we
have
a
verdict
if
that's
a
--
this
is
inconclusive
as
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
know
but
they
all
have,
do
they
not
in
your
state
all
have
to
agree
upon
the
same
thing
in
others?
in
other
words,
wouldn't
they
all
have
to
agree
that
either
mrs.
nolan
was
libeled
or
mr.
combs
was
libeled
or
mr.
luttrell
was
libeled?
they
couldn't
stood
up
and
say,
“well,
three
of
the
--
said
one
of
them
was
libeled,
three
are
the
same,
the
other
one
wasn't.
three
others
think
--
the
other
--
the
third
one
was
libeled
but
not
have
a
meeting
of
minds
of
the
jury
in
order
to
put
him
in
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how'd
they
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
told
that
they
--
if
they
would
have
to
agree,
all
of
them
on
--
that
each
of
them
were
libeled.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
had
--
chief
justice

justice
earl

chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,

answered
my
question.

you.
chief

the
question
mister
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
browning,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
is
there
any
other
definition
of
the
crime
of
which
this
man
was
charged
in
the
instructions
other
than
instruction
3
which
says,
“the

further
instructs

of
