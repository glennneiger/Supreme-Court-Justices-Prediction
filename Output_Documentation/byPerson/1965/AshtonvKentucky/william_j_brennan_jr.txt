william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
ask
if
the
crime
(inaudible),
i'm
looking
at
page
125
of
the
record,
would
this
(inaudible)
tried
by
the
trial
court
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
part
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
looking
--
this
is
the
court's
(inaudible)
of
the
jury
that
criminal
libel
is
defined
(inaudible)
as
any
writing
(inaudible)
public
model
of
which
any
act
which
went
on
in
this
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
whole
definition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
--
in
other
words,
(inaudible)
maybe
inferred
during
--
in
the
contents
of
the
publication
itself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
did
--
actually
nothing
other
than
the
publication
itself
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
rests
its
conclusion
that
there
was
a
sufficient
(inaudible)
upon
which
knowledge
or
recklessness
is
derived?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
browning,
i
think
your
court
of
appeals
analyzed
the
instruction
as
satisfying
the
standards
that
sullivan
and
garrison
laid
down
but
i'm
looking
at
page
125,
you
pointed
to
the
instruction
beginning
at
122
which
as
you
say,
charged
not
only
as
to
the
public
officials
but
also
as
to
the
--
as
mrs.
nolan,
not
that
--
it
had
to
be
--
the
proof
had
to
be
that
it
is
false
and
libelous,
was
so
known
to
be
false
and
libelous
from
--
published
by
the
defendant.
but
look
at
the
bottom
--
the
instruction
number
3,
particularly
the
word
further,
“the
court
further
instructs
that
criminal
libel
is
defined
as
any
writing
calculated
to
create
disturbances
of
the
peace
throughout
the
public
models
or
leave
any
acts
which
when
done
is
indictable.”
and
my
question
to
you
is
under
sullivan
and
garrison,
are
we
ful
--
freeing
and
notwithstanding
the
contrary
conclusion
of
the
--
of
your
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
that
strikes
us
as
an
ultimate
ground
which
certainly
if
that
had
been
the
only
instruction,
number
3,
i
think
you
would
agree,
would
not
have
satisfied
garrison
or
something
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
are
we
free
to
stay
whether
that
strikes
us
as
submitting
an
ultimate
ground
which
would
not
satisfy
garrison
and
sullivan
and
therefore
that
the
--
or
at
least
there
has
to
be
a
new
trial
of
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
your
court
held.
i
--
my
question
is
whether
we're
free
to
say
that
if
--
reads
to
us,
that
this
is
a
--
if
it
is
an
ultimate
ground.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
as
i
read
your
court
of
appeals
the
position
you've
taken
is
what
it
took,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
was
not
an
ultimate
ground
if
--
just
something
additional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
in
the
context
of
a
known
to
be
false
and
so
forth
which
just
preceded
it
that
it
could
not
have
misled
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
can
we
really
know
that
that
may
be
obsolete
but
when
the
jury
received
the
instruction,
how
are
we
to
say
that
they
could
not
rest
their
judgment
on
the
conclusion
that
this
writing
was
calculated
to
create
disturbances
of
peace.
and
that
that
alone
was
sufficient
to
support
a
conviction
without
regard
to
whether
these
--
this
defendant
knew
that
the
statements
in
the
writing
were
false.
can
we
say
that
the
jury
didn't
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
you
have
indeed.
i
don't
mean
i
agree
with
you
but
you
said
to
give
me
an
answer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
london
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
last
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
london
argued
that
outside
of
the
writing
itself
there's
no
evidence,
extrinsic
evidence
i
think
is
the
word
he
used,
upon
which
they
based
a
finding
of
knowledge
of
the
falsity
of
the
contents
of
the
writing.
what
do
you
have
to
say
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
--
how
--
upon
what
evidence
did
the
state
rely
to
support
the
charge
that
the
jury
must
find
both
that
they
were
false
and
libelous
and
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
publication
was
false
and
libelous?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
there
was
no
charge
here
that
the
--
that
malice
could
be
rested
on
a
finding
of
reckless
disregard
of
truth,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
instructions
may
have
been
but
i'm
still
interested
in
the
evidence
upon
which
a
finding
under
that
instruction
might
be
resting.
now,
you
say
it
has
to
be
that
the
evidence
that
he
was
a
stranger
in
town
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
there
is
none?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
on
what
then
does
the
finding
within
the
instruction
rest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
evidence
to
support
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(inaudible)
mr.
browning,
its
my
position
that
the
extravagance
of
the
statements
and
the
writing
itself
support
a
finding
of
reckless
disregard
of
the
treatment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
do
--
what
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
was
--
was
there
affirmative
evidence
of
these
people
that
he
had
never
approached
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
this
is
his
omission
to
check
with
them
coupled
with
the
extravagance
of
the
statements
in
the
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
well,
whichever
way
you
want
to
put
it
but
that's
all
there
is
you
say
in
the
way
of
evidence,
the
support
of
finding
of
reckless
disregard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
appear
in
the
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
ask
if
the

of
the
record,
would
this
(inaudible)
tried

that's

therefore
that

as

the

you've

not?
justice

if
