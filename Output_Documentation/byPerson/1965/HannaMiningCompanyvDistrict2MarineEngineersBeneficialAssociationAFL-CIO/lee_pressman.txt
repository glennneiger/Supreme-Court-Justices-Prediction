mr.
lee
pressman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
crucial
issue
that
presented
in
this
case
as
the
respondent
see
it
is
simply
this.
may
a
state
issue
an
injunction
to
enjoin
peaceful
picketing
and
at
this
point
i
raise
a
very
crucial
issue,
peaceful
picketing
at
a
common
situs
which
this
case
involves
where
arguably
the
activity
involved
is
subject
to
the
provisions
of
8
(b)
(4)
of
the
act.
mr.
lee
pressman
up
to
the
contrary
when
this
union
is
a
labor
organization.
mr.
lee
pressman
i
mean
this
union
hadn't
held
to
be
a
labor
organization.
mr.
lee
pressman
that
was
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
lee
pressman
well,
not
quite
in
this
case
but
may
i
add,
i
was
about
to
add
--
mr.
lee
pressman
all
the
general
counsel
has
held
in
this
case
is
that
the
employee
individuals
involved
in
the
primary
dispute
are
supervisors.
mr.
lee
pressman
there's
no
issue
in
dispute
that
we
are
labor
organization.
mr.
lee
pressman
i'm
sorry
sir.
in
the
--
the
labor
board
has
held
that
if
we
have
two
or
more
workers
as
members
who
are
employees
--
mr.
lee
pressman
when
--
and
we
have
--
in
this
case
there
was
no
such
issue
by
the
general
counsel.
the
general
counsel
had
only
two
matters
before
him.
one
was
a
charge
of
8
(b)
--
violating
8
(b)
(4).
he
held
in
the
particular
situation
presented
to
him
that
in
his
judgment
there
was
no
such
violation.
the
other
charge
that
was
filed
with
him
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(7)
and
he
held
there
that
since
supervisors
were
involved
there
could
be
no
violation
of
8
(b)
(7).
there
was
no
issue
of
the
labor
organization
sir,
none
in
this
case.
but
i
was
about
to
add
when
the
i
say
the
crucial
issue
to
us
is
whether
peaceful
picketing
at
a
common
situs
which
is
arguably
subject
to
the
provisions
of
8
(b)
(7)
maybe
enjoined
by
the
state
court
because
the
dispute
involves
supervisors.
the
government
concedes
in
the
memorandum
presented
--
mr.
lee
pressman
8
(b)
(4).
mr.
lee
pressman
argued
the
8
(b)
(4).
mr.
lee
pressman
(inaudible)
8
(b)
(4).
mr.
lee
pressman
the
government
concedes
in
the
memorandum
that
there
were
aspects
of
this
activity
to
common
situs
which
were
arguably
subject
to
the
provisions
of
8
(b)
(4).
that
stems
obviously
from
the
complaint,
in
the
amended
complaint
in
the
affidavits
filed
which
indicates
that
the
specific
picketing
on
which
this
suit
was
predicated
was
picketing
at
a
common
situs.
that
was
the
only
picketing
covered
in
the
specific
complaint
for
which
the
injunction
was
sought.
the
injunction
sought
down
below
was
to
enjoin
picketing
at
a
common
situs.
now,
further
the
government
concedes
that
the
picketing
at
the
common
situs
on
which
this
suit
was
based
occurred
in
april
of
1963
that
no
charges
have
ever
been
filed
by
the
petitioner
nor
has
the
general
counsel
or
any
agency
of
the
board
ever
reached
or
evaluated
the
picketing
of
1963.
so
that
the
government
states
on
the
basis
of
that
record
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
hasn't
reached
that
activity
and
that
arguably
that
activity,
that
picketing
of
1963
is
within
the
purview
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
of
the
act.
now,
the
government
states
that
the
policies
--
and
i
now
quote
from
the
memorandum,
“the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
are
further
by
excluding
all
state
regulation
at
least
until
the
board
has
evaluated
the
activity,
that
is
the
activity
of
usual
case
of
picketing
at
a
common
situs.”
mr.
lee
pressman
only
on
the
issue
that
--
mr.
lee
pressman
no.
your
honor,
the
general
counsel
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
8
(b)
(4)
provision
with
respect
to
1962
picketing.
he
also
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
8
(b)
(7)
because
supervisors
were
involved
and
8
(b)
(7)
only
covers
employees.
the
general
counsel
according
to
the
government
never
reached
the
1963
picketing
of
the
common
situs.
mr.
lee
pressman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lee
pressman
at
duluth.
mr.
lee
pressman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lee
pressman
absolutely
no
proceeding
and
the
government
states
on
page
14
of
their
memorandum
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
had
no
opportunity
to
evaluate
the
1963
picketing
at
superior
which
forms
the
basis
for
the
present
suit
because
hanna
did
not
file
an
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
charge
with
regard
to
that
picketing.
the
government
goes
on
to
add
at
that
repugnance
memorandum
on
page
14
accordingly,
the
1963
picketing
arguably
contains
some
secondary
elements
which
the
board
could
reach
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
mr.
lee
pressman
under
8
(b)
(4)
--
mr.
lee
pressman
i
agree
--
i
understand
the
government's
position
to
be
exactly
that
and
which
we
would
submit
would
be
a
frustration
of
the
principles
enunciated
in
garmon
and
all
the
cases
which
came
subsequent
to
which
i'd
like
to
refer
to
in
a
moment.
mr.
lee
pressman
(inaudible)
there'd
have
to
be
a
declaration
of
a
finding
--
mr.
lee
pressman
--
that
the
employees
involved
were
supervisors.
mr.
lee
pressman
and
i
assume
also
that
it
was
--
well,
a
labor
organization
wouldn't
be
involved
just
they
were
supervisors
that
all
be
required.
now,
i
submit
as
i
said
the
essence
of
the
entire
question
is
when
we
have
picketing
of
the
common
situs,
can
there
be
this
division
of
what
we
call
the
indivisible
activity
of
picketing
at
a
common
situs
any
more
than
solomon
could've
divided
a
single
child.
all
the
cases
that
we
have,
i
start
with
interlake
and
there's
a
case
which
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
were
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
came
to
our
attention
after
the
brief
was
filed
namely,
hattiesburg
building
trades
versus
broome
at
377
u.s.
we
point
to
those
two
cases
because
in
both
you
have
a
situation
where
there
is
picketing
at
a
common
situs
and
arguably
a
violation
under
section
8
(b)
(4).
in
both
cases,
in
interlake
as
well
as
in
hattiesburg,
extensively,
there
were
so-called
activity
which
a
state
could
attach
and
enjoin.
in
interlake,
we
had
precisely
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
had
the
state
law
which
forbids
so-called
“minority
picketing
or
minority
organizational
activity
as
well
as
an
arguable
secondary
boycott."
the
state
court
and
interlake
issued
the
injunction
on
the
ground
that
it
believed
that
no
labor
organization
was
involved.
now
before
this
court,
you
held
that
the
issue
of
labor
organization
had
to
go
to
the
board
first.
however,
the
basic
issue
would've
been
as
mr.
justice
brennan
just
indicated,
the
board's
position
would
be
that
regardless
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
so-called
primary
aspects
the
state
could
attach
to
those
primary
aspects.
mr.
lee
pressman
no,
to
the
contrary
that
the
aspects
--
mr.
lee
pressman
no,
your
honor.
i
said
this,
that
i'm
picketing
at
a
common
situs
where
there's
arguably
a
violation
--
mr.
lee
pressman
--
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
--
mr.
lee
pressman
regardless
--
mr.
lee
pressman
regardless
whether
there
are
supervisors
--
mr.
lee
pressman
that
the
board
has
primary
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
issue
of
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4).
mr.
lee
pressman
well,
of
course,
in
this
case
it
had
not.
mr.
lee
pressman
now,
if
it
had
we
submit
the
following.
under
the
morton
doctrine
where
there
are
secondary
aspects
as
in
this
case
but
the
board
want
to
find
that
it
was
kind
of
secondary
aspects
that
did
not
violate
specifically
section
8
(b)
(4).
as
we
read
morton
that
activity
would
be
permissible
though
not
prohibited
and
if
it
be
permissible
we
don't
think
that
any
face
of
that
activity
could
be
enjoined
by
the
state
and
respectfully
submit
that
is
the
doctrine
of
morton.
mr.
lee
pressman
well,
i
--
this
is
immaterial
i
would
say
either
they
would
adjudicate
as
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
in
which
event
the
board
would
issue
the
injunction
or
if
they
would
hold
that
though
there
are
secondary
aspects
nevertheless
8
(b)
(4)
would
not
violate
it
--
mr.
lee
pressman
--
that
under
morton
it
would
be
permissible
to
--
activity.
mr.
lee
pressman
i
do
think
that
i
differ
from
beside
the
point.
i
think
there's
a
significance
depending
with
the
board
hold
the
violation
or
no
violation.
now
the
board
seems
--
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor,
there
is
no
two
picket
lines
at
a
common
situs.
mr.
lee
pressman
to
be
--
for
this
reason
your
honor,
if
the
state
were
to
be
permitted
to
enjoin
picketing
at
a
common
situs,
all
picketing
--
mr.
lee
pressman
by
supervisory
employees.
all
picketing
ceases
which
means
the
board
then
is
never
--
can
reach
nor
does
it
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
issue
whether
or
not
the
facts
though
arguably
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
did
(inaudible)
--
they
did
not
constitute
a
violation.
now,
may
i
point
out
why
that
is
of
importance?
we
submit
that
there
is
a
definite
national
labor
policy
that
matters
pertaining
to
secondary
boycotts
which
fall
within
the
section
8
(b)
--
8
(b)
(4)
that
those
matters
rest
in
the
primary
competence
in
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
lee
pressman
well,
i
submit
supervisors
do
not
have
the
protection
of
section
7
or
section
8
(a)
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
issue
before
us.
mr.
lee
pressman
precisely.
mr.
lee
pressman
i
don't
see
how
you
can
separate
picketing
at
a
common
situs
between
so-called
primary
aspects
and
secondary
aspects.
it's
one
act
of
picketing.
here,
in
--
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor
i
would
say
this,
violence
cases
are
different
with
the
following
reason,
this
particularly
the
government
--
mr.
lee
pressman
it's
different
because
you
can
extract
the
difference
between
violence
conduct
and
peaceful
conduct
even
more
important.
i
think
as
i
read
the
cases
beginning
with
the
russell
case,
the
laburnum
case
and
the
youngdahl
case,
what
this
court
has
done
in
the
violence
cases
to
say,
where
there
is
activity
and
if
the
prohibition
are
the
same
is
so
deeply
rooted
in
local
tradition
you
have
permitted
the
states
to
attach
jurisdiction
to
that
activity
even
though
the
very
same
activity
maybe
subject
to
certain
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that's
the
violence
case.
i
think
it's
aptly
different
from
this
case.
mr.
lee
pressman
there
would
still
be
secondary
--
there
might
be
in
the
case,
secondary
aspect.
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor
--
mr.
lee
pressman
that's
not
correct
your
honor.
may
i
point
this
out
in
the
--
mr.
lee
pressman
yes,
in
morton.
in
the
morton
case
you
had
this
situation,
there
was
secondary
or
rather
picketing
at
a
common
situs.
employees
of
a
secondary
employer
were
induced
to
stop
work
but
in
addition
the
union
also
appealed
to
an
employer,
a
secondary
employer.
a
suit
was
begun
the
federal
district
court
under
diversity
i
believe
and
damage
is
sought
on
the
basis
of
violation
of
the
state
statute
with
respect
to
--
one
item
of
the
damages
was
the
activity
addressed
to
the
secondary
employer.
this
court
held
that
appeals
to
a
secondary
employer
is
not
a
violation
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
but
nevertheless
the
state
could
not
justify
or
attach
jurisdiction
over
that
activity
because
in
the
language
of
the
court
congress
had
focused
on
the
entire
field
of
secondary
boycotts
and
even
where
congress
has
not
prohibited
a
certain
phase
nevertheless,
the
states
were
restrained
from
entering
that
field
and
therefore
that
conduct
couldn't
be
restrained
or
damages
obtained
in
a
state
court
nor
was
it
a
specific
prohibition
under
section
8
(b)
(4).
it
had
become
permissible
conduct
under
morton.
mr.
lee
pressman
pardon?
that
was
a
303
suit
--
mr.
lee
pressman
but
i'd
call
to
your
attention
your
honor
that
the
principles
of
303
are
precise
and
the
same
as
the
principles
under
section
8
(b)
(4).
as
a
matter
of
fact
now,
section
303
simply
refers
to
8
(b)
(4).
now,
interesting
enough,
the
hattiesburg
case
which
is
not
a
situation
where
we
have
here
of
organization
picketing.
there
was
a
clear
cut
situation.
mr.
lee
pressman
pardon
me?
mr.
lee
pressman
it
was
per
curiam
and
that's
what
interest
me
and
that
its
the
last
case
on
the
subject,
it
follows
incres
and
it
follows
interlake.
there
is
a
situation
where
the
primary
employer
was
established
to
be
in
intrastate
commerce,
therefore,
obviously
not
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
picketing
was
conducted
at
a
common
situs
and
extensively
secondary
employees
had
been
induced
not
to
work.
the
court
have
and
under
a
state
law,
state
right
to
work
statute,
the
picketing
conducted
in
that
against
in
that
common
situs
was
in
violation
of
the
state
law.
the
state
court
issued
an
injunction
enjoined
the
picketing
at
the
common
situs.
this
court
by
per
curiam
decision
granting
certiorari
and
dismissing
the
injunction
held
the
phone
said
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
interstate
commerce
on
the
part
of
a
secondary
employer
established
in
effect
jurisdiction
of
the
board
for
the
secondary
boycott.
you
prevented
the
state
from
acting
against
that
intrastate
employer.
in
even
insofar
as
so-called
primary
aspects
of
the
picketing
were
concerned
because,
basically,
i
think
in
interlake
and
the
hattiesburg
case
this
court
has
maintained
where
there
is
picketing
at
a
common
situs
and
where
such
picketing
contains
elements
which
arguably
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4),
the
state
cannot
attach
to
any
face
of
that
activity
even
though
supervisors
are
involved
until
the
board
has
a
chance
to
rule
on
that
issue.
the
significance
of
the
ruling
would
depend
on
whether
it
held
to
be
a
violation
in
which
event
there's
no
problem,
in
its
final
adjudication
or
if
the
labor
board
would
hold
that
there
is
secondary
aspects
but
no
prohibition.
i
submit
the
doctrine
--
the
morton
which
might
still
restrain
the
states.
but
certainly
no
state
has
been
permitted
in
that
situation
to
issue
an
injunction
enjoining
picketing
so-called
primary
aspects
when
the
effect
of
the
injunction
is
to
completely
prevent
and
negate
the
board
from
ever
exercising
jurisdiction
over
this
field
clearly
given
to
it
by
congress
under
section
8
(b).
mr.
lee
pressman
the
incres
case,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
lee
pressman
i
would
say
this.
i
think
that
government
offers
that
as
a
case
in
point
i
think
it's
clearly
inapposite
for
this
reason.
as
i
read
incres
in
light
of
benz,
this
court
has
stated
the
following,
in
primary
disputes
between
or
rather
disputes
between
the
primary
parties,
the
primary
employer
and
the
primary
union
where
the
dispute
involves
the
labor
management
relations
of
a
foreign
vessel
and
a
crew
by
a
foreign
crew
neither
the
primary
aspects
nor
the
secondary
aspects
insofar
as
these
basic
parties
are
concern
are
within
the
purview
of
the
act
in
that
those
local
labor
management
relations
are
not
involving
affecting

in
benz
your
honor,
you
may
remember
you
issued
your
dissent
and
you
pointed
to
the
majority
opinion
which
did
the
following.
in
benz,
where
we
had
this
very
situation,
a
state
court
was
permitted
in
benz,
in
a
suit
by
the
primary
employer
against
the
primary
union
to
get
damages
on
the
basis
of
a
state
law
for
inducing
secondary
employees.
if
the
act
had
covered
that
situation,
that
could
not
have
obtained
because
the
suit
should
have
been
on
the
section
303.
to
the
contrary,
this
court
sustained
of
state
suit
in
benz
where
damages
were
awarded
for
inducing
secondary
employees.
and
finally,
in
incres
i
point
to
the
court,
that
you
cited
interlake
with
approval
certainly
thereby
not
counting
the
suggestion
of
the
government
that
incres
in
some
fashion
modify
interlake.

mr.
lee
pressman
oh,
your
honor
that
considerable
picketing
where
there
might
be
a
primary
picketing
and
no
secondary
aspects.
secondary
aspects,
i
don't
say
a
violation,
i
say
secondary
aspects
arise
only
in
the
event
secondary
employees
are
induced.
but
you
might
have
picketing
and
even
in
maritime
circles,
you
have
picketing
where
there
are
no
secondary
aspects
at
all.
for
example,
just
the
other
day,
the
same
union
was
picketing.
mr.
lee
pressman
no,
i
say
there
are
maritime
fleets
that
have
their
own
docks
and
there
are
no
secondary
employees
and
those
--
the
longshoreman
there
but
the
longshoreman
may
not
be
there.
there'd
only
be
primary
employees
involved.
or
on
the
other
hand,
when
--
we
submit
where
there
are
secondary
employees,
where
there
are
secondary
aspects
--
mr.
lee
pressman
well,
except
this
your
honor,
there
might
be
a
distinction
between
a
common
situs
which
is
this
case
and
the
picketing
at
a
primary
situs
with
other
employees
maybe
servicing
that
first.
mr.
lee
pressman
that
might
be
--
that
maybe
a
difference
there.
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
a
difference
result
should
eventuate,
all
i'm
pointing
out
that
in
this
case
we
specifically
had
picketing
at
a
common
situs
because
the
picketing
--
the
only
picketing
that's
involved
in
this
case
occurred
at
the
docks
of
a
secondary
employer.
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor,
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
where
the
board
might
hold
that
there
are
simply
were
no
secondary
aspects.
mr.
lee
pressman
no,
your
honor.
they
held
here
they
were
secondary
--
you're
talking
about
the
1962
picketing
now
because
there
was
no
action
in
the
1963
picketing.
mr.
lee
pressman
i
conceive
of
a
situation
where
the
board
might
find
that
there
were
absolutely
no
secondary
aspects
as
distinguished
made
violation
of
a
secondary
boycott.
when
i
say
no
secondary
aspects
i
mean
this.
they
may
well
affirm
that
not
secondary
employees,
that
no
secondary
employer
had
in
anyway
been
induced
or
in
anyway
involved
in
the
controversy
thereby
translating
the
situation
into
one
exclusively
that
of
a
dispute
and
the
only
activity
being
confined
to
the
primary
union
and
the
primary
employer.
mr.
lee
pressman
your
honor
--
mr.
lee
pressman
may
i
put
it
this
way
--
may
i
put
it
this
way,
your
honor.
whether
or
not
if
you
have
activity
or
picketing
at
a
second
--
at
a
common
situs,
whether
or
not
you're
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
depends
exclusively
or
primarily
on
whether
there
is
an
object
to
induce
the
secondary
employees,
so
that
the
same
physical
act
of
picketing
at
a
common
situs
and
it's
a
question
whether
there
is
an
object
which
is
purely
mental
on
the
part
of
the
(inaudible),
whether
that
ob
--
an
object
is
to
induce
to
secondary
employees.
mr.
lee
pressman
in
the
1962
picketing,
the
general
counsel
said,
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
an
object
addressed
toward
the
secondary
employer
or
the
secondary
employees.
there's
no
finding
on
the
1963
picketing.
mr.
lee
pressman
that's
correct
and
(inaudible)
--
isn't
it
question
whether
it's
a
year
or
not,
i
say
that
there
were
certain
picketing
at
a
common
situs
in
1963.
mr.
lee
pressman
no,
your
honor.
for
two
reasons,
first,
this
court
has
held
very
clearly
in
garmon
that
the
general
counsel's
decision
on
such
a
matter
is
not
a
final
decision
by
the
board
and
that
the
board
has
failed
to
give
the
so-called
“final
legal
significance
to
a
set
of
facts.”
the
general
counsel
specifically
is
--
does
not
suffice.
secondly,
even
assuming
a
complaint
had
been
issued
and
after
a
hearing
the
board
had
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
object
addressed
to
the
secondary
employees.
i
give
you
my
answer,
i
gave
previously
to
mr.
justice
brennan
but
under
the
morton
doctrine
that
may
well
be
construed
as
permissible
activity
which
again
the
board
could
not
attack
--
the
state
could
not
attack
jurisdiction.
now,
lastly
may
i
comment
briefly
if
i
may,
on
the
issue
which
up
until
now
we've
been
assuming
arguendo
that
--
mr.
lee
pressman
i
think
it's
in
my
brief
your
honor.
mr.
lee
pressman
i
say
--
i
pause
briefly
to
comment
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
has
actually
left
the
regulation
of
organization
or
recognition
activity
of
supervisors
to
the
states.
we
submit
that
a
fair
reading
and
interpretation
of
the
act
whereby
supervisors
have
been
excluded
from
the
term
employees.
but
in
light
of
section
14
(a),
congress
designedly
established
a
national
policy
pursuant
to
which
policy
supervisors
were
not
to
be
left
open
for
regulation
by
the
states.
now,
what
the
government
suggests
is
the
mere
exclusion
of
supervisors
from
the
definition
employees
certainly
signifies
congress'
intent
that
supervisors
be
left
to
the
states.
but
the
government
fails
to
give
heed
to
section
14
(a)
under
which
supervisors
are
given
the
right
to
join
and
become
members
of
unions.
the
only
limitation
on
section
14
(a)
is
that
there
maybe
no
state
or
federal
law
which
would
compel
an
employer
to
recognize
a
union
representing
supervisors.
it
is
our
unders
--
interpretation
as
we
read
the
act
in
light
of
the
amendment
to
section
7
or
the
amendment
on
the
definition
and
section
14
(a)
that
what
congress
did
is
to
decide
that
a
nice
balance
between
employers
and
supervisors
in
terms
of
their
relative
economic
forces
was
to
leave
the
regulation
of
their
activities
to
the
free
play
of
economic
forces.
i
honestly
and
voluntary
believe
that
if
the
question
have
been
asked
on
the
floor
of
congress,
what
is
the
intent
of
section
14
(a)
at
the
time
it
was
passed,
at
the
time
that
supervisors
were
omitted
from
the
definition
of
the
term
employees
the
idea
of
congress
was
that
employers
and
supervisors
could
take
care
of
their
own
problems
and
that
let
it
to
be
free
--
to
the
free
play
of
economic
forces.
certainly,
if
you
read
the
reports
of
the
house
and
the
senate
on
the
issue
of
14
(a),
it's
made
clear
that
congress
intended
to
establish
a
national
labor
policy
for
supervisors.
not
a
policy
such
as
we
have
for
employees
of
what
is
prohibited
and
what
is
permitted
but
nevertheless
a
national
labor
policy
which
is
in
effect
that
is
left
free
as
distinguished
from
any
state
being
able
to
attach
jurisdiction
over
the
same.
may
i
point
out
your
honor
lastly
that
when
congress
intended
to
see
jurisdiction
over
any
group
of
employees
or
any
area
of
conduct
or
activity,
congress
had
no
difficulty.
and
so
legislative
namely,
when
they
enacted
14
(b)
and
they
enacted
14
(c)
congress
knew
exactly
how
to
incorporate
a
specific
provision
that
would
permit
the
states
to
have
jurisdiction
over
a
specific
area
of
conduct
that
congress
wished
to
give
to
the
states.
thank
you,
your
honor.
