the
primary
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
courts
of
wisconsin
can
apply
state
law
to
regulate
primary
recognition
picketing
of
marine
engineers
on
petitioner's
vessels
after
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
initially
determined
that
such
engineers
are
supervisors
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
national
labor
relations
act.
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
has
determined
that
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
act
cannot
be
applied
due
to
the
supervisory
status
of
the
engineers
and
state
law
also
prohibits
this
type
of
picketing.
petitioner
operates
vessels
on
the
great
lakes,
actually
there
are
four
companies
who
operate
these
vessels
as
an
integrated
fleet,
with
one
of
the
petitioners,
the
hanna
mining
company
designated
as
the
operating
agent.
these
ships
transport
cargos
between
various
great
lake's
ports
including
american
and
canadian
ports
and
they
are
engaged
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
on
these
vessels,
the
petitioners
employed
marine
engineers
licensed
by
the
coast
guard
who
operate
the
engines
and
keep
them
in
repair
and
also
supervise
the
work
of
unlicensed
seamen
in
their
department.
the
unlicensed
seamen
are
represented
in
a
bargaining
unit
which
extends
over
all
of
these
vessels
by
the
united
steel
workers
of
america.
the
petitioners
had
a
labor
agreement
with
the
respondent
meba
covering
the
wages
and
working
conditions
of
the
engineers
which
expired
on
july
15th
of
1962.
negotiations
were
in
progress
for
a
new
labor
agreement
in
august
of
that
year
when
virtually
all
of
the
marine
engineers
notified
the
petitioners
in
writing
that
they
no
longer
desire
to
be
represented
by
the
meba
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
when
this
occurred,
the
petitioners
immediately
informed
the
meba
and
took
the
position
that
further
collective
bargaining
should
be
suspended
until
the
meba
could
by
means
of
a
secret
ballot
election
conducted
by
an
impartial
third
party
demonstrated
that
they
actually
represented
a
majority
of
the
engineers.
the
meba
declined
and
refused
to
agree
to
any
election
and
had
demanded
that
the
petitioners
resume
collective
bargaining
and
negotiate
a
labor
contract
which
the
petitioners
refused
to
do.
on
september
12
of
that
year,
1962
the
meba
commenced
picketing
petitioner's
vessels.
the
picketing
commenced
at
the
port
of
duluth
in
minnesota
where
one
of
petitioner's
vessels
was
unloading
a
cargo
of
coal.
the
meba
pickets
appeared
on
the
scene
with
signs
stating
that
the

company,
the
operating
agent
for
these
vessels,
was

appended
to

and
the
special
receptacle
for
that
purpose
was
a

with
the
name
of
the
petitioner's
vessels,
the
joseph
h.
thompson.
as
a
result
of
the
picketing,
the
coal
dock
workers
refused
to
unload
the
cargo
from
the
steamer
thompson.
the
picketing
was
commenced
on
that
same
day
at
the
oil
loading
docks
of
the
great
northern
railway
company
at
superior,
wisconsin
about
six
miles
away
from
the
coal
dock
where
the
petitioner's
vessels
regularly
load
cargos
who
buy
an
ore.
the
picketing
also
commenced
in
various
other
great
lake's
ports
including
detroit,
cleveland,
ashtabula,
and
buffalo
with
the
same
type
of
signs.
none
of
the
engineers
responded
to
the
picketing,
they
all
continued
working.
the
unlicensed
seamen
aboard
petitioner's
vessels
also
ignored
this
picketing
and
continued
working
steadily
as
did
the
other
offices
on
this
vessel.
nevertheless,
tug
crews
refused
to
render
towing
services
to
petitioner's
vessels
because
of
the
picketing
activity.
the
coal
dock
workers
persisted
in
a
refusal
to
unload
the
cargo
from
petitioner's
vessels
at
the
coal
dock
in
duluth.
there
were
some
short
and
minor
work
stoppages
among
the
oil
loading
crews
of
the
great
northern
railway
company
in
superior.
on
september
12th,
the
date
of
the
picketing
started
in
1962,
petitioners
filed
an
election
petition
with
the
regional
director
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
cleveland
requesting
the
board
to
conduct
a
representation
election
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
meba
in
fact
represented
a
majority
of
the
engineers.
the
regional
director
dismissed
the
petition
upon
a
finding
that
the
engineers
were
supervisors
and
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
ruling
was
appealed
to
the
nlrb
itself
and
was
affirmed
upon
the
same
ground.

the

was
dismissed
administratively
after

by
the
regional
director.
he
did
not
hold
the
hearing
and
neither
did
the
board
itself
although,
in
connection
with
the
election
petition,
the
petitioners
did
request
the
board
to
hold
a
hearing.
however,
the
board's
dismissal
stated
that
there
was
no
unit
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining
because
the
engineers
were
supervisors.
and
petitioners
about
three
days
after
the
picketing
commenced
at
duluth
filed
a
--

labor
practice
charge
with
the
regional
director
of

board
at
minneapolis
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
ports
of
superior
and
duluth.
the
charge
claimed

violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
of
the
act
which
prohibits
secondary
boycott
activity.
regional
director
and
the
staff
at

commenced
an
investigation
of
the
picketing
activities
and
other
activities
of
the
meba
and
attorney
signed
--

case

witness
statements
at

and
also
at

the
petitioners
applied
information
regarding
the
activities
of
the
meba
at
duluth,
superior,
and
cleveland
to
the
regional
director
for
the
board
at
minneapolis
and
supplemented
that
information
with
witness
affidavits
in
connection
with
the
activities
of
the
meba.
after
the
investigation
was
concluded
by
the
regional
director
at
minneapolis,
he
dismissed
the
charge
stating
that
there
was
no
indication
of
any
secondary
boycott
activity
which
would
violate
the
act.
this
ruling
was
also
appealed
--
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
it
was
on
the
basis
that
the
picketing
was
primary
and
not
secondary
that
it
conformed
to
the
board's
standards
in
a
moore
dry
dock
case
for
common
situs
picketing
and
therefore
could
be
regarded
as
no
more
than
primary.
this
ruling
by
the
minneapolis
region
was
also
appealed
to
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
after
consideration
the
national
labor
relations
board's
general
counsel
administratively
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
charge
on
the
ground
that
the
investigation
is
closed
that
the
picketing
was
merely
primary.
it
didn't
violate
the
board's
common
situs
rules
and
requirements
and
that
the
meba
activity
at
other
locations
or
other
sites
did
not
evidence
any
unlawful
objective
within
the
meaning
of
the
section
of
the
act
nor
it
did
the
totality
of
the
meba's
conduct
indicate
an
unlawful
objective
within
the
meaning
of
that
section
of
the
act.
petitioners
also
filed
a
charge
with
the
board's
regional
director
at
cleveland
claiming
that
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
federal
act
had
been
violated
which
regulates
recognition
and
organizational
picketing.
this
charge
after
investigation
by
the
regional
director
of
cleveland
was
also
dismissed.
in
his
dismissal,
the
--
it
was
dismissed
by
a
letter
and
a
letter
--
the
gist
of
it
was
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
picketing
or
they
tried
to
picket
which
violated
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
act.
this
ruling
was
appealed
to
the
nlrb's
general
counsel
in
washington
and
the
dismissal
was
affirmed.
the
general
counsel
stated
in
the
initial
letter
of
dismissal
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
picketing
which
violated
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
act.
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
board
in
a
concurrent
holding
had
held
that
the
engineers
were
supervisors
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
in
response
to
petitioner's
request
for
clarifications,
the
general
counsel
issued
another
letter
on
december
21st
of
1962
in
which
he
stated
that
his
conclusion
was
predicated
solely
upon
the
supervisory
status
of
the
marine
engineers
which
precluded
any
application
of
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
act
and
that
what
the
posture
of
the
case
would've
been
had
the
engineers
and
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
had
not
been
considered
and
that
this
procedure
was
in
accordance
with
the
established
practice
of
his
office.
great
lakes
navigation
is
seasonal
and
usually
extends
from
the
middle
of
april
until
the
end
of
november.
at
the
end
of
november
of
1962
before
the
final
rulings
were
obtained
from
the
general
counsel,
petitioner's
ships
were
withdrawn
from
operation,
laid
up,
the
crews
went
home
and
the
meba
stopped
picketing.
in
april
of
the
following
year
of
1963,
petitioners
again
placed
their
vessels
in
to
operation
and
the
meba
resumed
its
picketing
at
superior,
wisconsin
using
the
same
signs,
the
same
pickets
appeared,
and
they
stood
at
the
same
place
at
the
gates
to
the
oil
loading
docks
of
the
great
northern
railway
company.
there
was
no
change
whatsoever
in
the
picketing
at
that
time.
in
as
much
as
the
law
of
wisconsin
forbids
recognition
and
organizational
picketing
of
this
kind,
petitioners
filed
a
complaint
with
the
circuit
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
at
superior,
wisconsin,
seeking
injunctive
relief
against
the
continued
--
continuation
of
the
picketing
alleging
that
it
was
a
resumption
of
the
same
picketing
upon
which
the
nlrb
had
passed
and
its
general
counsel
had
ruled
setting
forth
the
initial
determinations
obtained
from
the
board
and
the
general
counsel
with
respect
to
the
supervisory
status
of
the
engineers
and
the
inapplicability
of
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
act
together
with
the
ruling
that
there
had
been
no
evidence
of
secondary
boycott
activity.
injunctive
relief
against
the
picketing
was
granted
in
the
form
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
by
the
circuit
court.
the
meba
appeared
specially
and
moved
to
dismiss
upon
a
ground
that
the
state
court
lack
jurisdiction.
ultimately,
the
state
court
did
dismiss
the
action
and
vacated
the
restraining
order
upon
the
ground
that
the
petitioner's
complaint
even
though
amended
to
clarify
the
pleadings
continued
to
arguably
allege
secondary
boycott
activity
that
the
action
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
since
this
court
decided
the
case
of
meba
versus
interlake
steamship
company
had
not
been
so
definite
and
certain
as
to
give
state
court's
jurisdiction
in
this
type
of
case.
petitioners
affirmed
--
appealed
in
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
and
that
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
affirmed
it
circuit
court.
noting
that
the
picketing
as
alleged
was
illegal
under
wisconsin
law
and
probably
not
protected
by
the
federal
law
in
as
much
as
the
engineers
were
supervisors
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
took
the
position
that
general
counsel's
rulings
cannot
be
given
the
final
legal
significance
that
board
rulings
are
given
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
san
diego
unions
versus
garmon.
and
since
the
picketing
approach
being
unlawful
under
federal
law
as
a
secondary
boycott,
the
state
courts
must
refuse
to
enjoin
them.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
indicated
that
it
realized
that
this
result
was
somewhat
of
the
paradox.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
also
said
that
the
arguability
of
certain
issues
as
being
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
continued
despite
the
determinations
that
were
obtained
by
the
petitioners
from
the
general
counsel
and
the
labor
board.
we
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
was
in
error.
the
general
counsel
specifically
empowered
by
the
federal
act
to
have
final
authority,
on
behalf
of
the
board
in
respect
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges,
the
investigation
of
them,
and
the
issuance
of
complaints.
until
the
general
counsel
for
the
board
issues
a
complaint,
the
case
never
reaches
the
board
itself.
in
the
ordinary
case,
a
refusal
by
the
general
counsel
to
issue
a
complaint
does
not
as
was
noted
in
the
garmon
case
leave
the
issue
with
unclouded
legal
significance
for
the
applicability
of
the
act
to
the
personnel
now
involved
and
to
the
activity
maybe
clear.
the
charge
is
merely
dismissed
because
of
a
lack
of
evidence.
however
in
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
general
counsel's
rulings
coupled
with
that
of
the
board
itself
that
the
engineers
were
supervisors
does
have
final
legal
significance
because
the
general
counsel's
ruling
meant
explicitly
that
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
act
which
regulates
primary
recognition
picketing
where
employees
are
involved
cannot
be
applied
because
in
essential
element
for
that
section
of
the
act
to
apply
is
the
presence
of
employees
and
the
engineers
were
supervisors.
consequently,
this
ruling
by
the
general
counsel
did
have
final
legal
significance
in
that.
it
said
that
the
board
could
never
reach
the
primary
recognition
picketing
of
supervisors
under
the
act
because
the
act
did
not
apply
to
such
activity.
a
possibility
of
secondary
boycott
activity
should
not
deprive
the
state
court
of
jurisdiction
over
the
primary
activity
in
the
case
of
this
type.
secondary
activity
which
is
left
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
something
more
than
primary
picketing.
it
amounts
to
activity
which
is
calculated
to
urge
neutral
employees
of
secondary
employers
to
cease
working
for
their
employer
in
an
effort
to
put
pressure
on
the
primary
employer
and
this
of
course
is
something
more
than
primary
picketing.
the
two
activities
can
exist
simultaneously
but
they're
separable.
consequently,
the
primary
picketing
could
be
left
in
the
case
of
recognition
picketing
of
supervisors
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
and
the
secondary
activity
could
remain
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
to
be
regulated
if
there
is
any
such
activity.
it
would
not
advance
the
policies
of
the
act
to
deny
the
state
court's
jurisdiction
of
the
primary
recognition
picketing
for
the
act
does
not
extend
to
such
activity.
the
national
labor
relations
board
perceives
no
encroachment
upon
its
jurisdiction
if
this
course
were
followed.
a
parallel
situation
arises
in
the
primary
picketing
of
foreign
vessels
usually
ship
picketing
occurs
at
a
common
situs
when
the
ship
is
tied
up
to
a
dock.
the
common
situs
includes
many
employers
other
than
the
shipowner.
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
incres
case,
it
was
held
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
not
applicable
to
foreign
ships
and
their
crews.
consequently,
state
courts
have
commenced
regulating
the
primary
picketing
of
such
foreign
vessels
and
the
courts
of
wisconsin
have
also
done
so.
in
the
meanwhile,
it
is
arguable
that
there
might
be
secondary
boycott
activity
connected
with
the
picketing
of
such
foreign
vessels
and
if
such
activity
exist
then
arguably,
at
least,
it
would
be
but
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
even
though
the
shipowner
may
not
be
subject
to
the
act
there
maybe
many
other
employers
within
that
common
situs
who
are
subject
to
the
act
and
who
maybe
affected
and
anyone
affected
by
the
secondary
boycott
activity
would
give
the
board
and
its
general
counsel
the
right
to
take
action.
since
state
jurisdiction
in
the
foreign
ship
picketing
cases
does
exist
side
by
side
with
arguable
nlrb
jurisdiction,
the
causes
of
action
have
as
a
practical
matter
have
been
shown
to
be
separable
and
can
be
acted
upon
by
the
state
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
the
case
maybe
without
infringing
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
each
other.
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
or
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
the
states
from
regulating
recognition
picketing
involving
supervisors.
in
the
1947
amendments
to
the
federal
act,
the
supervisors
were
removed
from
its
coverage.
the
reason
for
excluding
supervisors
was
that
congress
considered
it
anomalous
to
require
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
front
line
of
his
own
management
that
there
could
be
dual
loyalty,
a
conflict
of
interest.
and
for
that
reason,
congress
removed
supervisors
from
the
act
and
to
make
it
plain
that
no
employer
should
be
required
to
bargain
with
the
union
representing
such
supervisors
and
in
section
14
(a)
to
the
act
which
provided
that
such
bargaining
shall
not
be
compelled
by
any
national
or
local
law.
efforts
to
organize
supervisors
are
not
protected
by
means
of
the
federal
act
because
section
7
of
the
act
which
confers
such
protection
applies
only
to
employees
and
thereby
supervisors
are
excluded
by
definition.
similarly,
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
federal
act
which
regulates
recognition
and
organizational
picketing
applies
only
to
employees
due
to
the
general
exclusion
of
employers
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
in
wisconsin
and
other
states,
there
would
now
be
parallel
remedies
under
federal
state
and
--
under
federal
and
state
law
for
the
regulation
of
recognition
picketing.
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
federal
act
regulate
such
picketing.
the
wisconsin
law
under
the
vogt
case
also
regulates
such
picketing.
consequently,
there
is
no
repugnancy
between
the
state
and
the
federal
law
in
this
area
and
there
would
be
no
reason
for
prohibiting
the
states
from
regulating
recognition
picketing
as
a
matter
of
policy,
federal
policy
where
the
states
have
jurisdiction
of
course.
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
federal
act,
it
appears
that
congress
considered
the
technique
of
recognition
picketing
as
alien
to
the
policies
of
the
act
which
sought
to
provide
a
free
determination
of
their
bargaining
agent
to
employees
within
the
act,
consequently,
section
8
(b)
(7)
was
enacted
to
forbid
or
regulate
such
picketing.
state
law
has
also
based
upon
the
same
considerations
in
wisconsin.
the
wisconsin
law
is
founded
upon
the
public
policy
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
permit
recognition
picketing
which
would
compel
an
employer
to
coerce
his
employees
in
a
choice
of
a
bargaining
agent
or
otherwise
pays
economic
lost
or
economic
run
perhaps
in
a
particular
case.
this
type
of
picketing
has
not
been
left
to
the
free
interplay
of
economic
forces
because
it
is
against
public
policy
as
coercive
and
unfair.
furthermore,
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
section
14
(a)
of
the
act
which
relieves
the
employer
of
compulsion
to
bargain
with
supervisors
provides
any
protection
for
this
type
of
conduct.
the
stated
purpose
of
section
14
(a)
was
to
relieve
the
employer
of
the
duty
to
bargain
with
supervisors.
it
does
not
in
anyway
preclude
a
state
from
protecting
an
employer
against
organizational
recognition
picketing
where
supervisors
are
involved.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
yes.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
yes.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
on
the
8
(b)
(4)
charge?
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
yes,
that
is
my
understanding
of
it
because
they
are
separate
cause
of
action,
the
recognition
picketing
being
one
cause
of
action,
the
secondary
boycott
activity
being
another
cause
of
action.
unfortunately,
this
case
became
trammeled
up
with
the
8
(b)
(4)
rulings
of
the
general
counsel
because
that
possibility
was
presented
to
the
board
for
determination.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
yes.
that
is
petitioner's
view
because
of
the
separability
of
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
that
was
a
determination
of
the
board.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
yes,
you
have
to
have
that.
and
the
only
way
that
it
could
be
obtained
from
our
understanding
of
board
procedure
is
to
file
an
election
petition.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
and
have
the
board
make
an
investigation
and
rule
upon
that
question.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
because
there's
no
provision
in
the
act
that
we
know
of
that
would
provide
for
advisory
opinions
as
initial
determinations
in
this
area.
it's
necessary
to
file
petitions
and
file
charges
using
the
ordinary
procedure
of
the
board
and
then
the
board
will
determine
the
issue.
it's
only
in
the
limited
area
where
the
amount
of
commerce
in
which
the
employer
is
engaged
in
might
be
the
subject
of
an
advisory
opinion
but
not
these
questions
that
are
presented
here.
and
in
this
area,
there
seem
to
be
some
question
in
the
mind
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
regarding
the
procedure
for
obtaining
initial
determination
such
as
required
in
these
federal
labor
preemption
cases
to
resolve
arguable
issues
where
arguably
the
nlrb
may
have
jurisdiction
for
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
stated
that
employer
--
the
petitioners
conceded
the
arguability
of
the
engineer's
status
as
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
by
filing
a
section
8
(b)
(7)
charge
and
asking
the
general
counsel
to
prohibit
such
activity.
well,
the
only
way
that
there
could
be
a
determination
by
filing
a
charge
and
this
did
not
indicate
that
that
petitioners'
felt
that
engineers
were
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
furthermore,
the
time
element
that's
involved,
the
charges
having
been
filed
in
september
and
the
final
rulings
on
the
charges
not
being
issued
until
december
and
that
the
cessation
of
the
shipping
season
for
the
winter
months
on
a
great
lakes
have
caused
some
difficulty
to
the
courts
below
now
that
the
facts
may
not
have
been
the
same.
well,
petitioners
believe
that
the
point
where
facts
are
being
determined
was
never
reached.
there
was
never
any
hearing
held
by
any
tribunal.
the
rulings
were
made
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
amended
complaint.
when
a
sup
--
when
the
sufficiency
of
a
complaint
is
challenged,
the
pleader
is
entitled
to
the
favorable
inferences
which
can
be
drawn
from
the
facts,
they
are
considered
in
the
most
favorable
light
as
far
as
the
pleader
is
concern
so
that
there
was
no
justification
for
speculation
regarding
the
facts.
the
proceedings
never
reached
the
point
where
evidence
was
adduced.
petitioners
believe
that
the
meba
versus
interlake
steamship
company
decided
by
this
court
is
distinguishable
from
the
present
case
because
in
interlake,
no
initial
determinations
were
sought
or
received
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
instant
case
attempting
to
follow
the
requirements
laid
down
in
the
interlake
case.
petitioners
sought
these
initial
determinations
and
then
presented
them
to
the
state
courts
of
wisconsin
for
application
to
the
factual
situation
which
was
involved.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
no,
i
would
not
say
that
because
under
the
wisconsin
view,
it
remains
as
recognition
picketing
only
when
a
minority
of
the
supervisors
or
employees
are
involved.
if
majority
are
involved
in
the
picketing
activity
then
it's
regarded
as
a
labor
dispute
and
not
enjoinable
by
the
state.
mr.
john
h.
hanninen
no,
i
think
the
constitutional
guarantees
in
a
situation
where
a
majority
of
the
supervisors
took
action
in
a
concerted
fashion
would
protect
them.
it's
only
in
the
limited
area
where
a
minority
is
attempting
to
impose
their
will
on
the
majority
that
this
court
have
stated
that
wisconsin
in
the
vogt
case
could
validly
enjoin
such
picketing
which
was
coercive
and
not
violate
constitutional
guarantees.
