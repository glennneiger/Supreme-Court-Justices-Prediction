unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
(inaudible)
that's
your
position?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
state
could
issue
an
injunction
where
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
held
that
this
union
is
not
a
labor
organization.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
--
unknown
speaker
not
--
you're
putting
on
your
different
suit
now
because
this
general
counsel
held
that
it
was
composed
only
of
supervisory
employees.
unknown
speaker
and
not
in
this
--
not
in
this
case
technically
because
he
wasn't
a
party
to
this
case
but
i
mean
--
unknown
speaker
but
do
we
have
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
your
supervisory
employees
(inaudible)
--
ipso
facto
not
a
labor
organization.
unknown
speaker
but
he
held
that
you
didn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
general
counsel
found
against
you
on
these
issues,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
of
primary
and
secondary?
unknown
speaker
i
note
--
i
know
two
picket
lines,
one
primary
and
the
other
secondary
picket.
unknown
speaker
there's
one
--
if
one
picket
line
and
if
the
state
has
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
picketing
for
one
of
those
reasons
why
isn't
it
on
solid
ground?
unknown
speaker
by
supervisory
employees?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
management
of
us
steel
corporation
could
picket
constitutionally
but
they
wouldn't
have
the
protection
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
unknown
speaker
the
cases
are
balanced
you
cite
are
little
different
because
there
you
can
enjoin
picketing
validly
or
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
one
reason
why
they're
different.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
to
the
incres
--
unknown
speaker
--
international
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
--
i
mentioned
incres
because
it's
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
any
picketing
that
doesn't
have
primary
and
secondary
aspects.
unknown
speaker
it
maybe,
yes,
but
i
say
it's
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
many
cases
of
that
kind.
unknown
speaker
how
--
those
people
driving
trucks
with
provisions
and
bringing
oil
and
gas
and
things
of
that
kind
of?
unknown
speaker
i
was
thinking
just
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
the
primary
(inaudible)
--
that
there
are
no
secondary
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
that
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
