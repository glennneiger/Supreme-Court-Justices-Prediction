justice
william
j.
brennan,

how
much
of
the
hearing
preceded
the
regional
director's
actions
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
that
mean
is,
this
was
primary
picketing
in
that
or
that
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
what
--
if
i
understand
the
board
to
be
correct
then,
it
was
immaterial
that
you
went
as
to
the
8
(b)
(4)
aspect
of
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
went
to
the
board
or
the
regional
office
or
general
counsel
or
anybody
else,
the
state
court
accorded
to
the
board
to
the
extent
this
was
primary
picketing
had
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
it
whether
you
ever
want
to
be
--
afford
or
not,
that's
the
way
you
read
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
interested
whether
you
had
the
board's
brief
as
i
did
that
that's
immaterial
which
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
--
was
the
8
(b)
(7)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
argued
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
argued
the
8
(b)
(4).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
--
1963,
was
that
superior
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
1962
was
at
duluth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
all
the
proceedings
that
involved
the
regional
director
and
the
general
counsel
concerned
the
duluth
picketing,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there's
never
been
any
proceeding
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
understand
the
board's
position
mr.
pressman
if
i
asked
your
adversary,
he
did
as
meaning
that
independently
of
any
proceeding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
situation
like
this,
a
state
court
may
determine
in
the
first
instance
whether
there
are
primary
aspects
to
the
picketing
and
enjoin
if
it
finds
that
there
are
even
though
you've
never
--
even
though
no
one's
ever
been
to
the
board
on
an
8
(b)
(4)
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
so
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
earlier
(voice
overlap)
to
this
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
determination
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
independent
of
the
facts
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(inaudible)supervisors
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
one
thing
i
don't
quite
follow
here
mr.
pressman.
if
i
had
correctly
understood
your
argument,
it
was
that
the
board
might
find
that
does
not
involved
any
prohibited
secondary
activity
and
did
you
then
suggests
that
from
that
finding
is
an
inference
that
there
might
still
be
secondary
activity
whether
it's
permissive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
secondary
activity
was
either
prohibited
or
it
didn't
exist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
have
we
any
--
have
we
ever
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
303
suit
after
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
a
per
curiam?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
per
curiam?
