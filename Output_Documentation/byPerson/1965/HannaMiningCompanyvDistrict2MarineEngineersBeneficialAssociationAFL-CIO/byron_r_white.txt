justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
state
could
enjoin
the
strikes
by
the
supervisors?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
about
wisconsin
and
that's
maybe
about
state
law
but
what
if
the
state
law
purported
to
permit
the
enjoining
strikes
and
the
only
reason
that
state
couldn't
--
wouldn't
or
didn't
enjoin
the
strike
was
because
its
preempted
in
doing
so.
do
you
think
the
labor
law
would
permit
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
the
very
same
token
mr.
pressman
your
position
is
that
irrespective
of
whether
there's
been
a
board
finding
about
the
secondary
features
of
this
picketing
that
the
state
may
not
enjoin
the
primaries.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they've
said
--
i
thought
you
were
--
the
burden
of
your
argument
was
that
the
federal
law
meant
to
that
there
was
to
be
a
hands
off
--
hands
off
of
activities
of
supervisors
in
the
picket
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
now,
what
if
the
board
has
already
--
has
gone
ahead
and
decided
there
are
no
secondary
aspects?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
what
about
it
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
you
whether
the
board
had
adjudicated
this
a
secondary
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
board
--
both
the
board
and
you
think
that
it's
beside
the
point
perhaps
if
they've
adjudicated
