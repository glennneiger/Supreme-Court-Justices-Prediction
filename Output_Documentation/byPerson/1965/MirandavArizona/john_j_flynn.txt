mr.
john
j.
flynn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerned
itself
with
the
conviction
of
a
defendant
of
two
crimes
of
rape
and
kidnapping,
the
sentences
on
each
count
of
20
to
30
years
to
run
concurrently.
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
in
an
effort
to
avoid
possible
confusion,
that
the
defendant
was
convicted
in
a
companion
case
of
the
crime
of
robbery
in
a
completely
separate
and
independent
act.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
treated
that
conviction
as
a
companion
case
in
a
companion
decision,
and
portions
of
that
record
have
been
appended
to
the
record
in
this
case
as
it
bears
on
the
issue
before
the
court.
now
the
issue
before
the
court
is
the
admission
in
evidence
of
the
defendant's
confession
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case
over
the
specific
objections
of
his
trial
counsel
that
it
had
been
given
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
the
trial
court
in
june
of
1963,
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
escobedo,
allowed
the
confession
into
evidence.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
april
of
1965,
after
this
court's
decision
in
escobedo,
affirmed
the
conviction
and
the
admission
of
the
confession
in
evidence.
this
court
has
granted
us
review.
the
facts
in
the
case
indicate
that
the
defendant
was
a
23-year-old,
spanish-american
extraction,
that
on
the
morning
of
march
13,
1963,
he
was
arrested
at
his
home,
taken
down
to
the
police
station
by
two
officers
named
young
and
cooley.
that
at
the
police
station,
he
was
immediately
placed
in
a
line-up,
he
was
there
identified
by
the
prosecutrix
in
this
case
and
later
identified
by
the
prosecutrix
in
the
robbery
case.
immediately
after
the
interrogations,
he
was
taken
into
the
police
confessional
at
approximately
11:30
a.m.
and
by
1:30
they
had
obtained
from
him
an
oral
confession.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
the
interrogation
room,
described
in
the
transcript
as
interrogation
room
no.
2,
if
your
honor
please.
he
had
denied
his
guilt,
according
to
the
officers,
at
the
commencement
of
the
interrogation,
by
1:30
he
had
confessed.
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates
that
in
no
time
during
the
interrogation,
and
prior
to
his
confession,
his
oral
confession,
was
he
advised
either
of
his
rights
to
remain
silent,
or
his
right
to
counsel,
or
of
his
right
to
consult
with
counsel,
nor
indeed,
was
such
the
practice
in
arizona
at
that
time
as
admitted
by
the
officers
in
their
testimony.
the
defendant
was
then
asked
to
sign
a
confession
to
which
he
agreed.
the
form
handed
to
him
to
write
on
contained
a
typed
statement
as
follows
which
precedes
his
handwritten
confession
-
“i,
ernesto
a.
miranda,
do
hereby
swear
that
i
make
this
statement
voluntarily
and
of
my
own
free
will,
with
no
threats,
coercion,
or
promises
of
immunity,
and
with
full
knowledge
of
my
legal
rights,
understanding
any
statement
i
make
may
be
used
against
me.”
this
statement
was
read
to
him
by
the
officers,
and
he
confessed
in
his
own
handwriting.
throughout
the
interrogation,
the
defendant
did
not
request
counsel
at
any
time.
in
due
course,
the
trial
court
appointed
counsel
to
defend
him
in
both
cases
and
the
defense
counsel
requested
a
psychiatric
examination,
which
has
been
made
a
court
the
--
and
the
medical
report
has
been
made
a
portion
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
in
this
case
as
it
enlightens
us
to
a
portion
or
some
of
the
factual
information
surrounding
the
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
that
is
correct
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
yes,
there
is,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
it
arises
as
a
result
of
the
appendix
in
the
robbery
conviction.
in
this
respect,
i
would
answer
your
honor's
question
by
referring
to
page
51
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
to
the
appendix
--
or
excuse
me,
page
52.
at
the
top
in
which
the
question
was
asked
by
mr.
moore,
the
trial
counsel
-
“did
you
state
to
the
defendant
at
any
time
before
he
made
the
statement
you
are
about
to
answer
to,
that
anything
he
said
would
be
held
against
him?”
answer,‘‘no,
sir.”
question,
“you
didn't
warn
him
of
that?”
answer,
“no,
sir.”
question,
“did
you
warn
him
of
his
rights
to
an
attorney?”
mr.
moore,
“we
object,
not
voluntarily
given.”
mr.
turoff,
“i
don't
believe
that
is
necessary.”
the
court,
“overruled.”
on
page
53,
the
succeeding
page,
a
portion
of
the
same
record
indicates
further
cross-exam
--
further
examination
concerning
this
conversation,
“had
you
offered”
--
i
am
starting
approximately
one-third
down
the
page,
“had
you
offered
the
defendant
any
immunity?”
“in
your
presence,
had
officer
cooley
done
any
of
these
acts?”
answer,“no,
sir.”
question,
“about
what
time
did
this
conversation
take
place,
officer?”
answer,“approximately
1:30.”
“shortly
after
mrs.
mcdaniels
made
her
first
statement,
is
that
correct?”
answer,
“yes,
sir.”
“can
you
tell
us
now,
officer,
regarding
the
charge
of
robbery,
what
was
said
to
the
defendant
and
what
the
defendant
answered
in
your
presence?”
answer,
“i
asked
mr.
miranda
if
he
recognized
--”
and
there
the
question
terminates.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i
submit
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i
was
about
to
continue,
if
your
honor
please,
to
page
54,
at
which
we
find
the
question,
“you
never
warned
him
he
was
entitled
to
an
attorney
or
anything
he
said
would
be
held
against
him,
did
you?
answer,
“we
told
him
anything
he
said
would
be
used
against
him,
he
wasn't
required
by
law
to
tell
us
anything.”
and
consequently,
this
would
answer
your
honor's
question,
except
bearing
in
mind
that
the
record
clearly
reveals
that
from
the
lineup
and
the
identification
to
the
interrogation
room,
the
officers
established
the
time
as
11:30,
and
that
the
confession
was
completed
and
signed
at
1:30.
reading
the
testimony
of
the
robbery
conviction,
it
is
apparent
to
me
that
the
officers,
when
they
recite
or
answered
on
page
54
of
the
transcript
that
he
had
been
advised
of
his
rights,
were
again
relating
to
this
formal
typed
heading,
which
would
be
at
1:30,
at
the
time
he
signed
a
confession,
that
hence,
there
really
is
no
conflict
in
the
record
as
to
when
he
was
advised
of
his
rights.
the
further
history
relating
to
this
defendant
found
in
the
psychiatric
examination
would
indicate
that
he
had
an
eighth
grade
education.
and
its
found
by
the
supreme
court
that
he
had
a
prior
criminal
record
and
that
he
was
mentally
abnormal.
he
was
found,
however,
to
be
competent
to
stand
trial
and
legally
sane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
acts.
now,
the
critical
aspect
of
the
defendant's
case
--
confession,
i
think,
is
eminently
demonstrated
when
during
the
trial
the
prosecutrix
was
asked
the
question
concerning
penetration,
in
which
she
first
responded
that
she
was
--
that
she
thought
it
was
by
finger,
under
questioning
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
immediately
thereafter,
she
expressed
uncertainty
as
to
the
manner
or
method
of
penetration
and
after
some
prompting,
responded
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
that
it
had
been
in
fact,
by
the
male
organ.
on
cross-examination,
she
again
expressed
the
uncertainty
in
relation
to
this
penetration
which
of
course
is
the
essential
element
of
the
crime
of
first-degree
rape
in
the
state
of
arizona,
when
she
did
--
responded
to
his
question
that
she
simply
was
unsure
whether
it
had
been
by
finger
or
by
penis.
now
of
course,
the
defendant's
confession
neatly
corrects
this
“reasonable
doubt”
that
otherwise
would
have
been
engendered,
when
in
precise
terminology
he
wrote,
“asked
her
to
lie
down,
and
she
did.
could
not
get
penis
into
vagina,
got
about
one-half
(half-written)
inch
in.”
the
only
thing
missing
or
the
only
thing
that
the
officers
failed
to
supply
in
words
to
this
defendant
at
the
time
he
wrote
this
confession
was
in
violation
of
section
13-611,
arizona
revised
statutes.
then
of
course,
they
would
have
had
the
classic
confession
of
conviction
because
they
could
have
argued
that
the
man
even
knew
the
statutory
provisions
relating
to
rape.
the
state
as
i
read
their
response,
takes
no
issue
with
the
statement
of
facts
as
i've
outlined
them
to
this
court,
except
to
say
that
we
overstate
his
mental
condition
and
minimize
his
educational
background.
and
also
the
concern
that
is
expressed
by
mr.
justice
fortas
concerning
at
what
stage
of
the
proceeding
he
may
have
been
advised
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
now,
the
petitioner's
position
on
the
issue
is
simply
this,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
we
feel,
has
imprisoned
this
court's
decision
in
escobedo
on
its
facts.
and
by
its
decision
is
refusing
to
apply
the
principles
of
that
case
and
for
all
practical
purposes
has
emasculated.
certainly
every
court
desiring
to
admit
a
confession
can
find
distinguishing
factors
in
escobedo
from
the
fact
situation
before
it.
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
quote
from
the
transcript
of
the
record
which
contains
the
arizona
decision
at
page
87.
"it
will
be
noted
that
the
court
in
the
escobedo
case
set
forth
the
circumstances
under
which
a
statement
would
be
held
admissible,
namely,
one,
the
general
inquiry
into
an
unsolved
crime
must
have
begun
to
focus
on
a
particular
suspect.
two,
the
suspect
must
have
been
taken
into
police
custody.
three,
the
police
in
its
interrogation
must
have
elicited
an
incriminating
statement.
four,
the
suspect
must
have
requested
and
been
denied
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
his
lawyer.
five,
the
police
must
not
have
effectively
warned
the
suspect
of
his
constitutional
rights
to
remain
silent.
when
all
of
these
five
factors
occur,
then
the
escobedo
case
is
a
controlling
precedent.”
now,
the
arizona
supreme
court
having
built
or
having
indicated
its
clear
intention
to
imprison
the
escobedo
decision
set
about
to
do
precisely
that.
first,
as
to
the
focusing
question,
it
indicated
that
this
crime
had
occurred
at
night.
and
consequently,
despite
the
positive
identification
of
the
defendant
by
two
witnesses,
which
the
state
urged
were
entirely
fair
lineups,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
indicated
that
even
then
perhaps
under
these
facts,
attention
had
not
focused
upon
this
defendant.
i
think
this
is
sheer
sophistry
and
would
indicate
the
obvious
intent
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
to
confine
escobedo
and
to
distinguish
it
whenever
possible.
next,
the
court
found
that
the
defendant
was
advised
of
his
rights
in
the
reading
of
the
typed
portion
immediately
preceding
its
transcript.
they
permitted
that
document
to
lift
itself
by
its
own
bootstraps
so
to
speak,
and
to
indicate
that
here
was
a
man
who
was
knowledgeable
concerning
his
legal
rights,
despite
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
his
background
and
his
education.
and
they
further
found
that
he
was
knowledgeable
because
he
had
a
prior
criminal
record,
though
in
the
decision
he
indicated
this
would
be
knowledge
of
his
rights
in
court
and
certainly
not
his
rights
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation.
i
think
the
numerous
briefs
filed
in
this
case
indicating
the
substantial
split
in
the
decisions
throughout
the
various
states,
the
circuits
and
the
federal
district
courts,
indicate
the
interpretation
that
has
been
placed
upon
escobedo.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
california
decision
in
dorado.
we
have
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
russo,
which
would
indicate
that
principle
and
logic
are
being
applied
to
the
decision.
and
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
when
the
process
shifts
from
the
investigation
to
one
of
accusation,
and
when
the
purpose
is
to
elicit
a
confession
from
the
defendant,
then
the
adversary
process
comes
into
being.
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
cases
that
would
distinguish
this
have
found
and
give
rise
to
what
i
submit
is
not
really
confusion
by
merely
straining
against
the
principles
and
logic
in
that
decision.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i
think
that
the
man
at
that
time
has
the
right
to
exercise,
if
he
knows,
and
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
in
arizona,
if
he
is
rich
enough,
and
if
he's
educated
enough
to
assert
his
fifth
amendment
right
and
if
he
recognizes
that
he
has
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
request
counsel.
i
simply
say
that
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding,
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
miranda
of
a
man
of
limited
education,
of
a
man
who
certainly
is
mentally
abnormal,
who
is
certainly
an
indigent,
that
when
that
adversary
process
came
into
being
that
the
police,
at
the
very
least,
had
an
obligation
to
extend
to
this
man
not
only
the
--
his
clear
fifth
amendment
right,
but
to
accord
to
him
the
right
of
counsel.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
bring
a
jury
in.
i
simply
would
extend
to
the
man
those
constitutional
rights
which
the
police
would
at
that
time
taken
away
from
him,
simply
his
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i
think
that
the
first
right
is
the
fifth
amendment
right,
not
to
incriminate
oneself,
the
right
to
know
that
you
have
that
right
and
that
of
the
right
to
consult
with
counsel,
at
the
very
least,
in
order
that
you
can
exercise
the
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i
think
what
i
say
with
--
what
i
am
interpreting
“adversary
proceeding”
to
mean
that
at
that
time,
a
person
who
is
poorly
educated,
who
in
essence
is
mentally
abnormal,
who
is
an
indigent
to
--
if
he
is
in
adversary
proceeding,
at
the
very
least,
he
is
entitled,
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding,
to
be
represented
by
counsel
and
to
be
advised
by
counsel
of
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
or
he
has
no
such
right.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
precisely
my
--
my
point.
and
the
only
person
that
can
adequately
advise
a
person
like
ernest
miranda
is
a
lawyer.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
that's
--
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
that
he
had
a
right
not
to
incriminate
himself,
that
he
had
the
right
not
to
make
any
statement,
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
free
from
further
questioning
by
the
police
department,
that
he
had
the
right,
at
the
ultimate
time,
to
be
represented
adequately
by
counsel
in
court,
that
if
he
was
too
indigent
and
poor
to
employ
counsel,
that
the
state
would
furnish
him
counsel.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
the
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
no.
the
attempt
to
erode,
or
to
take
away
from
him,
the
fifth
amendment
right
which
already
existed
and
that
was
the
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
to
be
convicted
out
of
his
own
mouth.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
if
he
knew
about
it.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
yes,
your
honor,
if
he
knew
about
it
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
he
was
aware
of
it,
if
he
was
knowledgeable.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
if
he
could
afford
it,
yes.
he
was
intelligent
enough
and
strong
enough
to
stand
up
against
police
interrogation
and
request
it,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
well,
i
simply
mean
that
when
it
becomes
an
adversary
proceeding,
at
the
very
least,
a
person
in
ernest
miranda's
position
needs
the
benefit
of
counsel,
and
unless
he
is
afforded
that
right
to
counsel
he
simply
has,
in
essence,
no
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
right,
and
there
is
no
due
process
of
law
being
afforded
to
a
man
in
ernest
miranda's
position.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
only
comment
that
i
could
make
is
that,
without
getting
ourselves
into
the
area
of
precisely
when
“focusing”
begins,
that
i
must
in
this
instance
limit
it
to
the
fact
situation
and
the
circumstances
of
ernesto
miranda,
because
for
every
practical
purpose,
after
the
two-hour
interrogation,
the
mere
formality
of
supplying
counsel
to
ernest
miranda
at
the
time
of
trial,
in
what
i
would
submit
would
really
be
nothing
more
than
a
mockery
of
the
assertion
of
his
sixth
amendment
rights
to
be
represented
in
court,
to
go
through
the
formality
of
a
trial
and
conviction
takes
place.
well,
this
simply
is
not
a
matter
of
the
record.
it
is
in
the
robbery
trial,
and
i
think
it
so
illustrates
the
position
of
what
occurs
in
the
case
of
persons
who
have
confessed
as
ernest
miranda.
the
question
was
asked
in
the
robbery
trial
which
preceded
the
rape
trial
by
one
day
of
mr.
moore.
the
court,
are
you
ready
to
go
to
trial?”
mr.
moore,
“i
have
been
ready.
i
haven't
anything
to
do
but
for
my
men
and
sit
down
and
listen.”
mr.
john
j.
flynn
well,
i'd
say
that
it
certainly
and
most
assuredly,
does
protect
them.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
that
in
the
state
of
the
law
today
as
pronounced
by
the
arizona
supreme
court,
under
those
guiding
principles,
it
certainly
does
protect
the
rich,
the
educated,
and
the
strong,
those
rich
enough
to
hire
counsel,
those
who
are
educated
enough
to
know
what
their
rights
are
and
those
who
are
strong
enough
to
withstand
police
interrogation
and
assert
those
rights.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
it
does
not
afford
protection.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
it
protects
all
persons
from
incriminating
or
convicting
themselves
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
at
the
interrogation
stage,
if
he
is
simply
is
too
ignorant
to
know
that
he
has
the
fifth
amendment
right,
then,
certainly
literacy
has
something
to
do
with
it,
your
honor.
if
the
man
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation
has
never
heard
of
the
fifth
amendment,
knows
nothing
about
its
concept
or
its
scope,
knows
nothing
of
his
right,
then
certainly
his
literacy
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
well
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
perhaps
i
have
simply
not
expressed
myself
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
covers
everybody,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
clearly
in
practical
application,
in
view
of
the
interrogation
and
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
miranda,
it
simply
had
no
application
because
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
that
particular
case
and
that's
what
i'm
attempting
to
express
to
the
court.
now
the
arizona
supreme
court
went
on
to
--
in
essence
we
submit,
turn
its
decision
primarily
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
in
this
case
to
request
counsel,
which
is
the
only
really
distinguishing
factor
that
they
could
find.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
none
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
so
the
question
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
we
have
--
not
raised
no
question
that
he
was
compelled
to
give
this
statement
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
in
the
sense
that
anyone
forced
him
to
do
it
by
coercion,
by
threats,
by
promises,
or
compulsion
of
that
kind.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
well,
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
the
man
at
a
time
without
knowledge
of
his
rights
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i
would
say
that
his
fifth
amendment
right
was
violated
to
the
extent
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
because
he
was
compelled
to
do
it?
mr.
john
j.
flynn
yes,
to
the
extent
that
he
was,
number
one,
too
poor
to
exercise
it.
number
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
two,
mentally
abnormal.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i
say
it
was
taken
from
him
at
a
point
in
time
when
he
absolutely
should
have
been
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
afforded
the
sixth
amendment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
in
the
sense
that
your
honor
is
presenting
to
me
the
word
“compelled,”
you're
correct.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
not
by
gunpoint
as
mr.
justice
black
has
indicated.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
he
was
called
upon
to
surrender
a
right
that
he
didn't
fully
realized
and
appreciate
that
he
had.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
it
was
taken
from
him.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i
would
say
that
as
a
result
of
lack
of
knowledge
of
--
or
for
lack
of
a
better
term
failure
to
advise,
the
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel,
staged
in
a
proceeding
when
he
most
certainly
need
it
--
needed
it
that
this
could
in
and
of
itself
and
certainly
in
most
police
interrogations
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
constitute
compulsion.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
the
whole
process
of
a
person
having
been
raised,
i
would
assume,
to
tell
the
truth
and
to
respect
authority.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
no,
your
honor.
he
was
in
confinement
and
under
arrest.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
it
is
an
abdication
of
the
fifth
amendment
rights
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
simply
because
of
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
the
total
circumstances
existing
at
the
time,
the
arrest,
the
custody,
the
lack
of
knowledge,
the
status
of
the
individual.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
that
of
course
is
an
implied
promise
of
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
some
help
or
immunity
of
some
kind.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
that
certainly
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
--
is
not
compulsion.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
in
the
sense,
the
word
as
mr.
justice
white
has
implied
it.
mr.
john
j.
flynn
i'm
sure
mr.
justice
black
(inaudible)
far
better
than
--
mr.
john
j.
flynn
yes,
i
think
perhaps
that
was
a
bad
choice
of
words
in
context,
if
your
honor
please,
at
the
time
i
state
them.
i
would
like
to
state
that
in
conclusion,
that
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
arizona,
for
example
has,
since
statehood,
provided
to
the
citizens
of
our
state
language
precisely
the
same
as
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
as
it
pertains
to
searches
and
seizures.
and
yet
from
1914
until
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
versus
ohio,
we
simply
did
not
enjoy
the
fourth
amendment
rights
or
the
scope
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
that
were
enjoyed
by
most
of
the
other
citizens
of
the
other
states
of
this
union,
and
those
persons
who
were
under
federal
control.
in
response
to
the
amicus
from
new
york
and
for
the
amicus
for
the
national
association
of
defense
attorneys
that
would
ask
this
court
to
go
slowly
and
to
give
the
opportunity
to
the
states,
to
the
legislature,
to
the
courts,
and
to
the
bar
association
to
undertake
to
solve
this
problem,
i
simply
say
that
whatever
the
solutions
may
be,
it
would
be
another
46
years
before
the
sixth
amendment
right
in
the
scope
that
it
was
intended,
i
submit,
by
this
court
in
escobedo,
will
reach
the
state
of
arizona.
we're
one
of
the
most
modern
states
in
relation
to
the
adoption
of
the
american
law
institute
rules.
we
have
a
comparable
rule
to
rule
5.
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
never
been
a
criminal
prosecution
for
failure
to
arraign
a
man.
there
is
no
decision
in
arizona
that
would
even
come
close
to
the
mcnabb
or
mallory
rule
in
arizona.
in
fact,
the
same
term
that
miranda
was
decided,
the
arizona
supreme
court
indicated
that
despite
the
necessity
and
requirement
of
an
immediate
arraignment
before
the
nearest
and
most
successful
magistrate
that
mallory
versus
mcnabb
did
not
apply.
