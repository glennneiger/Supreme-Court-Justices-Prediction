mr.
thurgood
marshall
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
have
to
check
on
when
the
page
proofs
were
mailed
to
mr.
fawcett
and
i
will
be
able
to
report
that
after
lunch,
i
will
have
that
checked.
i
think
in
the
first
place,
we
have
to
get
a
few
things
cleared
up
on
the
factual
basis
of
this
case.
there
is
not
one
word
in
this
record
at
any
place
that
there
was
any
cooperation
at
all
between
the
state
and
the
fbi
other
than
one
that
they
did
notify
and
they
wanted
to
talk
to
westover
and
on
11:45
the
following
morning,
they
told
him
they
like
to
talk
to
him
and
they
didn't
until
12:00.
these
17
hours
is
also
very
interesting.
he
was
arrested
at
9:45,
tried
to
the
kansas
city
police
headquarters
after
questioning
on
the
street
and
searched.
and
that
sometime
thereafter,
he
was
put
in
a
lineup
and
identified.
and
at
11:45,
he
was
booked.
and
petitioner
himself
said
booked
him
to
the
jail.
we
are
unable
to
find
in
the
record
whether
he
was
booked
at
the
police
headquarters
or
the
jail.
it's
kind
of
confused.
but
i
have
checked
and
while
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
the
jail
is
directly
across
the
street
from
the
police
headquarters.
but
this
interrogation
for
17
hours
is
not
in
the
record.
the
record
shows
he
was
questioned
for
a
portion
of
the
time
between
9:45
and
11:45
at
night.
he
was
questioned
sometime
the
next
morning
but
the
only
pinpoint
on
that
is
that
11:45,
he
was
seen
talking
to
a
police
sergeant
into
open
area
of
the
police
headquarters.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
11:45
the
next
day,
he
was
seen
talking
to
a
detective
sergeant,
i
think
klein
or
something
like
that.
it
appears
he
was
in
the
open
area.
the
other
thing
is
that
what
is
in
the
record
is
that
at
no
time
was
any
federal
officer
present
while
the
state
was
questioning,
that's
positive
testimony.
it's
also
a
positive
testimony
that
there
were
no
state
officer
present
when
they
questioned
him.
and
when
you
bear
in
mind
that
between
12:00
and
either
2:00
or
2:30,
they
had
gotten
two
false
statements
from
him.
and
the
time
it
took
to
question
him
and
to
write
it
out
in
longhand,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
he
must
started
talking
very
soon
after
12:00.
that's
just
stands
to
me
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
12
o'clock
the
next
day,
he
was
arrested
the
night
before
the
fbi
asked
for
him
at
11:45.
at
12,
they
gave
them
a
private
room
and
the
federal
questioning
started
at
12
noon
on
the
day
after
his
night
arrest
at
9:45.
the
--
there
is
also
evidence
and
this
evidence
is
from
the
defense
counsel
in
calling
fbi
agents
as
his
witnesses
despite
the
judge,
it
seemed
--
it
looks
as
though
he
got
somebody
with
uniform
with
the
other
team
on
but
he
still
called
them.
and
they
testified
positively
that
this
man
was
in
perfect
condition.
he
seemed
to
have
complete
control
of
his
faculties,
and
number
one,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
he
ever
asked
to
call
anybody
at
anytime
under
any
circumstances.
the
record
also
shows
that
he
was
obviously
from
california
with
california
licensed
plates,
living
in
a
hotel
in
kansas
city
and
so
far
the
record
shows,
he
didn't
have
any
friends,
relatives,
or
anybody
else.
he
did
not
take
to
stand
himself.
he
sought
to
build
this
case
on
government
witnesses
particularly
fbi
agents,
and
he
didn't
make
the
grade.
it's
also
apparent
that
he
made
a
choice
and
that
is
in
the
record
where
the
court
said
in
sentencing
him,
i
think
it
was
on
70
--
but
anyhow,
i
get
the
page.
in
sentencing,
the
court
says,
“you
know
and
realize
that
had
you
been
tried
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california
for
the
same
robbery
you
could've
gotten
life",
and
he
said,
“yes
sir.”
and
i
think
that
he
made
a
choice.
he
constantly
denied
the
crime
to
the
states
and
when
the
fbi
talked
to
him,
he
made
these
two
statements.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
checked
during
the
lunch
and
recess,
page
proofs
were
mailed
by
airmail
on
wednesday.
and
if
they
didn't
reach,
it's
not
the
fault
of
the
department
of
justice.
it
would
be
the
fault
of
the
post
office
department.
i'm
sorry
if
you
didn't
get
them.
i
--
what
i
concluded
before
lunch,
i'm
at
the
point
where
i
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
while
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
what
happened
the
night
before,
there's
also
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
westover
was
at
anytime
won
by
the
state.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other.
the
statutes
and
the
rules
of
missouri
do
apply
that
a
man
must
be
brought
to
the
stage
of
arraignment
within
20
hours
after
arrest.
that
brings
me
to
the
point
that
i
think
is
a
crux
of
this
case,
is
that
the
mallory
rule
and
the
anderson
case,
and
a
couple
of
cases
so
relied
upon
by
petitioner
just
do
not
bear
any
factual
basis
in
this
record.
i
don't
believe
there
is
this
stage
of
anything
wrong
with
the
state
and
the
federal
government
in
the
prosecutorial
stage
having
a
statement
where
one
as
the
other,
“if
you
find
counsel,
i
want
to
talk
to
him.”
there's
no
question
that
when
he
was
picked
up
the
night
before,
it
was,
as
the
petitioner
admits
primarily
for
the
two
robberies
in
kansas
city
specifically
a
finance
company
and
a
bakery.
much
is
made
of
the
fact
that
the
money
that
was
seized
on
westover,
$607
was
seized
by
the
state
police.
it
was
examined
jointly
by
the
state
police
and
the
fbi.
it
is
true
that
the
state
and
the
fbi
jointly
took
down
the
serial
numbers.
one
read
it
off
and
the
other
marked
it
down
for
the
use
of
both
to
see
which
place
the
money
--
the
sale
money
would
fit
into.
and
the
record
shows
that
least
as
to
the
federal
charges
in
the
banks
that
were
robbed,
they
had
these
packs
of
money
with
marked
bills
in
which
they
stick
into
the
tellers'
cages
for
this
expressed
purpose
in
case
they
are
robbed.
but
this
--
there's
nothing
illegal
about
the
cooperation
in
that
stage.
secondly,
as
i
mentioned,
there
were
no
federal
officers
present
during
state
interrogation.
that
is
in
the
record,
positively.
secondly,
that
the
state
police
denied
that
they
made
any
inducement
to
westover.
that
if
you
talk
to
the
federal
or
anything,
they
never
mentioned
it
to
him.
then
it's
repeatedly
said
by
each
of
the
witnesses
that
there
was
no
deal
of
any
kind
between
the
police
and
the
fbi.
and
this
evidence
is
brought
out
by
the
defendant.
it's
clear
that
at
the
time
the
fbi
examined
westover,
he
was
a
state
prisoner
and
not
a
federal
prisoner.
on
page
79
of
the
record,
there
is
a
testimony
that
westover,
when
the
fbi
began
to
question
him,
he
was
mentally
alert
and
appeared
to
know
exactly
what
he
was
doing,
no
evidence
that
he
had
been
held
up
late
at
night
or
kept
awake
or
anything.
there
was
no
federal
warrant
outstanding
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
--
i
mean
at
the
time
that
he's
questioned
by
the
fbi.
and
the
fbi
agent
says
positively
at
the
time
they
questioned
him,
they
had
none
of
the
details
concerning
the
sacramento
robbery.
not
only
was
he
advised
of
his
rights
by
witness
of
the
evidence
of
the
two
statements
he
made
but
the
fbi
agents
testified
from
the
witness
stand
that
he
was
fully
advised
of
his
rights.
and
that
statement
is
that
i
advised
him
that
he
didn't
have
to
make
a
statement,
that
any
statement
he
made
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
court
of
law
and
that
he
had
the
right
to
see
an
attorney
before
he
made
the
statements.
and
the
final
point
is
everything
i
have
said
is
uncontradicted.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
during
the
questioning
between
12:00
and
2:00
or
2:30.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
were
three
agents
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
and
the
statement
says
that
he
was
told
in
front
before
he
has
made
the
statement.
but
the
test
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
--
that's
what
the
statement
says.
but
this
says
--
where
it
doesn't
say
exactly
when.
it
says
where
the
statement
is
made
free
--
was
he
advised
of
his
rights,
and
after
he
was
told,
then
he
went
ahead
and
made
the
statement.
so
it
appears
from
page
82
that
it
was
before
the
statements
were
made.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
never
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
showed
that
he
ever
asked
for
counsel.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
this
is
practically
it
and
it's
always
given.
and
at
least
so
far
as
the
department
of
justice
is
concerned,
has
witnessed
this
or
an
(voice
overlap)
practice
of
the
fbi,
we
can
deduce
this
is
the
practical
way
to
do
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
statement
says
that
if
he
wants
to
see
an
attorney,
he
can
do
it
before
he
talks.
that's
what
this
warning
says.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
he
says,
“i
still
want
to
talk
one”,
then
it
would
be
my
position
that
the
most
--
the
agent
would
have
to
say
is,
“we
do
not
have
a
lawyer.
we
had
no
means
of
furnishing
you
a
lawyer.”
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
the
agent
would
then
say
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
can't
give
you
a
lawyer,
we
can't
pay
for
a
lawyer
for
you,
do
you
want
to
talk?”
and
he
is
then
--
well,
i
think,
in
a
position
to
say,
“if
i
don't
get
a
lawyer,
i
don't
talk
and
that's
the
end.”
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
it's
necessary,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
don't
want
to
be
accused
of
dealing
semantics.
but
at
this
stage,
i'm
not
too
sure
he
has
a
right
which
he
needs
to
waive.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
the
waiver
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
it
would
be
a
waiver
of
his
right
to
remain
silent,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
will
not
take
a
statement?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
it's
up
to
the
agent
at
that
stage.
that's
a
possibility
but
i
think
the
more
and
likely
possibility
would
be
the
agent
will
say,
“since
i
can't
give
you
a
lawyer
and
i
don't
think
you
have
a
right
for
us
to
furnish
you
a
lawyer.
i
ask
you
again
after
repeating
this,
do
you
want
to
talk?”
and
then
he
has
the
choice
to
make.
he
said
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
would
think.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
once
the
man
makes
it
clear,
that
he
does
not
want
to
talk
or
he
will
only
talk
on
certain
terms,
and
those
terms
are
not
met,
i
think
that
the
authority
at
that
stage
should
stop
questioning.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
imagine
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
(inaudible)
with
the
fbi,
or
would
be
reasonably
certain,
they'd
stop.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he's
an
indigent
i
don't
--
i
just
don't
know
of
any
facilities
in
existence
to
get
a
lawyer.
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
prior
to
arraignment,
i
--
i
am
sure
that
speaking
for
the
federal
government,
there's
no
provision
i
know
of
to
hire
a
lawyer.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
if
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
understands
it,
mr.
justice
white.
if
he
understands
this
which
i
submit
an
average
person
can
understand,
then
i
say
the
only
purpose
of
a
lawyer
at
this
stage
would
be
devising
what
this
statement
means.
well,
if
he
knows,
he
doesn't
need
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
i
think
he's
talking
voluntarily.
and
he's
not
being
in
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
either
being
forced
or
threat.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
think
that
it's
--
well
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
depends
on
the
individual.
if
you
--well,
just
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
you
remember
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
the
lawyer
being
present
is
relative
to
this
point.
and
i
may
go
right
straight
to
the
escobedo
case
on
that,
where
the
man
wants
to
see
his
wife,
haynes
against
washington,
or
wants
to
see
his
lawyer,
escobedo,
and
the
investigating
authority
say,
“the
only
way
you
will
see
that
person
is
for
me
to
allow
you
to
see
him,
i've
got
the
key
in
my
hand
to
open
the
door,
and
i'm
not
going
to
open
it
unless
you
talk.”
then
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
the
man
--
number
one,
if
the
man
says,
the
--
in
one
way
he
has
a
lawyer,
“i
want
to
call
my
lawyer
etcetera,
etcetera”,
then
i
say
the
normal
procedure
would
be
you'd
have
to
wait
until
he
calls
his
lawyer
and
his
lawyer
talks
to
him.
when
he
says,
“i
don't
have
a
lawyer,
i'm
broke,
but
i
would
appreciate
if
you'd
get
me
a
lawyer."
you
say,
“well,
we
don't
have
a
lawyer.
we
have
no
means
of
getting
a
lawyer
for
you.”
mr.
thurgood
marshall
which
is
true
and
so
far
as
i
know,
i
know
of
no
place
unless
it's
some
legal
aid
society
voluntarily
puts
lawyers
in
there.
and
that's
not
true
in
any
place
i
know
of
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
would
have
to
just
about
say
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there's
nothing
wrong
with
him
saying,
“no”.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
this
case
is
--
there's
nothing
that
he
has
ever
--
so
far
as
we
know,
as
soon
as
the
door
is
shut,
he
started
talking.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
he's
not
being
denied
anything.
he's
not
being
denied
anything.
the
state
is
not
affirmatively
denying
him
anything.
the
state
just
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
is
not
furnishing
him
something.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
all
of
those
cases,
mr.
justice
black
is
where
you
have
a
right
and
i
don't
think
you
have
a
right
to
a
counsel.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
would
have
a
right
to
consult
his
lawyer.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
would
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
griffin
was
a
different
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
can't
equalize
the
whole
thing.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don't
believe
we
can
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
because
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i've
been
unable
to
find
one
that
grants
it
as
such.
it's
inherent
in
the
investigatory
process,
proceeding
the
prosecutorial
process.
and
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
questioned.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
know
it
is
sir
and
--
i
am
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
our
best.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
the
question
of
holding
him
--
i
am
not
--
i'm
unaware
of
the
other
questions
were
asked.
i
think
he
can
be
held
for
a
time
to
at
least
check
out
what
he
was
arrested
for.
that
time
would
be
a
very
short
time.
i
am
thoroughly
in
complete
agreement
with
arraigning
the
man
or
give
him
the
judicial
process
as
soon
as
it's
possible.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
providing
the
interrogation
is
on
the
checking
out
point,
because
for
example
a
man
has
an
alibi
and
alibi
is
out
of
town
or
something
like
that.
if
the
--
if
an
alibi
was
right,
say,
you
could
check
it
out
in
15
minutes.
if
he's
out
of
town,
it
would
take
two
hours
or
so.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
there's
any
short
line
we
can
put
down.
my
point
is
that
when
the
questions
are
made
and
the
answers
are
made,
i
think
the
mistake
is
in
reading
the
mind
of
the
questionnaire,
i
think
you
should
read
the
mind
of
the
person
who
is
making
the
statement.
and
if
he
is
making
the
statement
on
the
theory
that
he
is
obliged
to
make
it,
and
not
even
as
far
as
has
to
make
it,
then
i
think
that's
overreaching.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
--
i
think
that
comes
to
the
point
that
we
have
to
decide
on
what
kind
of
a
crime
that
its
--
we
are
investigating,
what
are
the
problems,
and
i'm
not
balancing,
mr.
justice
black.
but
just
--
this
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
i
would
question
the
court,
but
if
i
may
just
to
give
you
two
cases
we
mentioned
in
our
briefs,
the
question
of
the
well-trained
criminal
lawyer
if
by
any
chance
anyone
who
might
commit
a
crime
and
he's
investigated,
he
would
need
any
lawyer
and
that
could
be
considered
as
going
to
the
end.
but
there's
a
case
pending
here
right
now
on
certiorari
from
the
second
circuit,
u.s.
against
cone,
where
a
man
is
caught
with
a
huge
case
of
marijuana
on
the
chair
beside
where
he's
sitting
and
a
few
marijuana
cigarettes
in
his
pocket.
and
the
agents
take
him
outside,
the
narcotics
agents,
in
broad
daylight
in
the
middle
of
manhattan
and
then
walked
into
one
block
down
from
the
studio
where
they
picked
him
up
to
the
car.
they
don't
want
him,
they
questioned
him,
and
he
tells
the
whole
story,
but
it
was
all
a
part
of
the
arrest.
i
don't
see
any
overreaching
there
to
hold
such
a
confession
out.
then
you
have
a
confession
where
the
man's
been
there
and
i
think
the
important
point
that
mr.
--
the
chief
justice
has
thought,
when
you
are
holding
him
for
this
questioning
and
then
you
certainly
can
hold
him
incommunicado.
that
is
absolutely
forbidden.
if
he
wants
to
talk
to
his
family,
he
shall
be
permitted
to
do
it.
if
he
wants
to
talk
to
his
lawyer,
he
should
be
permitted
to
do
it.
but
the
lawyer
--
the
only
advice
the
lawyer
can
give
him
is
what
the
statement
means,
the
lawyer
can't
prevent
him
from
being
fingerprinted.
the
lawyer
can't
prevent
him
from
being
mugged.
the
lawyer
can't
prevent
him
from
being
put
in
a
lineup.
the
only
thing
the
lawyer
can
do
would
be
to
tell
him
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
me.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
hope
that
as
long
as
this
court
sits,
end
of
quote
--
i
would
hold.
but
i
think
the
real
point
is
that
it
made
the
difference
we
had
is
the
denial
of
the
right
to
see
your
own
lawyer.
and
i
respectfully
cannot
get
too
close
to
this
ability
to
hire
a
lawyer.
you
couldn't
staff
every
precinct
with
a
legal
staff
of
lawyers.
it
can't
be
done.
and
once
the
rule
is
made,
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
once
he
reaches
the
precinct,
you
must,
by
force
or
power
in
alabama,
insist
that
it'd
be
an
effective
counsel.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
say
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
see
his
counsel.
i
said
to
deny
him
the
right
to
see
his
counsel
or
his
wife
makes
the
statements
that
he
makes
conditional
upon
him
seeing
them.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say,
"yes
sir",
with
one
exception.
if
it
can
be
construed
that
the
person
confessing
gets
the
feeling
that
unless
i
talk,
i
won't
see
my
lawyer.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that's
inherent.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
alright.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
the
fifth
amendment
which
as
in
those
circumstances
puts
upon
the
man
making
the
statement
and
unreasonable
restraint
in
urging
him
to
talk
in
order
to
gain
something.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
remain
silent.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir
because
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
--
the
difference
as
i
see
it
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
in
the
second
case,
there
is
no
possible
urging
that
the
man
can
get,
that
if
i
make
the
statement,
you
will
then
let
me
talk
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
is
that
there's
a
lawyer
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
what
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
--
if
i
go
back
to
the
--
i
see
not
too
much
difference
with
my
position
on
escobedo
and
haynes.
the
reason
--
well
haynes
had
a
wife.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he
hadn't
had
a
wife
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
--
i
didn't
want
to
go
that
far
but
i
think
it
is
that
there
is
something
available
to
you.
and
if
you
don't
incriminate
yourself,
you
won't
get
that
something
that
you
would
normally
do.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
before
the
crime
sometimes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
but
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
not
--
i
don't
say
automatically
that
that
confession
is
out
of
the
second
one
because
if
he's
had
enough,
if
the
record
shows
that
he's
had
his
lawyer
represent
him
in
the
last
six
quarter
periods,
as
i
think
if
i
was
the
judge,
i
could
say
he
knew
his
rights.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i've
always
been
opposed
to
dragnet
arrest
of
any
kind
but
the
--
if
i
may
say
so,
the
--
to
really
put
that
in
proper
focus,
anybody
that
had
a
lawyer
would
have
got
the
writ
--
got
his
man
out.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
get
a
lawyer
to
get
a
writ
to
get
the
other
ones
out,
that's
the
way
the
lawyers
has
to
do
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
as
the
law
now
stands,
i
would
say
that
the
only
redress
they
have
would
be
that
they
were
the
subject
of
this
dragnet
arrest
and
their
rights
had
been
denied
by
the
dragnet
arrest
and
that
anything
came
as
a
result
of
it
would
go
out.
now,
that's
what
i
think
the
court
should
do
in
such
a
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
would
go
out
when
they
--
i
mean
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
use
those
statements
in
court
in
my
position.
i
don't
think
so
because
they
--
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
the
arrest
itself
was
invalid
and
any
incarceration
then
was
bad.
but
on
the
cases
we
are
working
on,
we're
working
on
the
theory
that
the
arrest
was
a
valid
arrest.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
i
think
that
escobedo
can
very
well
fit
into
the
--
this
case
under
the
fifth
amendment
point,
but
i
don't
want
to,
in
any
way,
give
support
to
any
theory
that
we
believe
that
escobedo
requires
that
a
lawyer
be
appointed
to
an
indigent
in
the
police
precinct
or
at
the
arrest.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
supposedly,
if
you
use
accusatory
stage
as
the
point,
and
a
policeman
is
coming
down
the
street,
and
crash,
goes
in
the
window,
and
he
rushes
up
to
where
the
crash
is,
and
there's
a
rock
inside
the
window
and
the
man
with
his
hand
on
some
jewelry,
well,
he's
in
a
rather
accusatory
position.
well,
you
wouldn't
need
a
lawyer
for
him
in
that
stage.
i
mean,
this
accusatory
thing
as
i
think
would
get
us
in
trouble.
it's
where
the
man's
mind
is
changed,
not
to
police's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
then
i
think
he
could
very
well
say,
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
talk.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
if
the
--
if
it
appears
to
the
trial
judge
that
he
really
meant
he
wasn't
going
to
talk,
and
then
after
that,
he
was
conjured
over
as
in
escobedo,
he
was
handcuffed
or
something,
then
i
think
the
statement
would
be
in
trouble.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
--
for
the
purpose
where
the
--
to
my
mind,
once
he
says
“any
terms”
--
“i'll
talk
if…”
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
i
went
to
other
steps.
i
said
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
said
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
he
makes
that
clear,
that's
it,
if
he
makes
that
clear.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
he
makes
it
clear.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
he
says
--
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
get
off
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
that
i
--
i'm
giving
him
--
i'm
the
agent.
i'm
giving
him
another
factor
which
is
that
you
assume
i
can
get
a
lawyer
for
you
and
the
truth
is
i
don't
have
a
lawyer.
i
don't
have
them
and
i
can't
get
a
lawyer
for
you.
now,
with
that
understanding
--
let
me
read
the
balance
of
this
statement
to
you
again.
do
you
still
want
to
talk?
and
the
guy
says,
“no.”
then
i
say,
the
agent's
through,
the
agent's
through.
that's
--
but
i
had
to
--
i
think
i
--
in
my
own
mind,
i
have
to
tell
it
in
order
to
make
sure
about
it.
the
real
problem
is
that
what
--
when
he
talks
later.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
he
has
to
sign
a
waiver
at
all.
i
think
that
--
i
don't
know
if
you
noticed
the
real
careful
trial
judges,
they
always
in
each
stage
after
recess,
they
put
these
facts
in
the
record.
well,
i
don't
think
that's
necessary
if
he
recess
the
question
for
15
minutes
and
come
back
to
you
after
reading
the
statement
over
and
over
again.
i
think
the
whole
thing
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
have
the
manual
but
i
don't
have
it
with
me,
it's
not
supposed
to
be
out.
i
will
check
it
fair
enough
if
i
may
send
the
letter.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
is.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
it
is
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
have
an
official
manual.
i
have
it
as
i
know
it
could
be
released
to
the
court.
but
the
question
is
i
feel
obliged
to
give
it
to
petitioner's
counsel
and
i
would
much
rather
check
with
mr.
hoover
before
i
do
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
a
whole
(voice
overlap)
--
it's
a
full
manual.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
alright
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we'll
get
that,
we'll
get
the
fact
and
i
hasten
to
point
out
though
that
the
--
i
think
the
fbi
is
the
only
one
that
that
does
it
uniformly,
the
narcotics
bureau
and
customs,
i
don't
think
it's
just
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
how
exactly
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
in
the
least,
not
in
the
least.
we
also
say
that
for
practical
matter,
the
warning
is
better
to
be
given
but
it's
not
required.
i
have
not
receded
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
