justice
william
o.
douglas
well
counsel,
we
know
--
everybody
knows
that
if
he's
--
when
a
lawyer
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
that
the
lawyer
can't
possibly
represent
him,
he
needs
time
to
prepare
for
a
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
the
appointment
must
be
at
some
point
anterior
to
the
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
our
question
here
is
that
what
point?
how
far
anterior?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
we
--
and
under
the
procedures
in
some
states
as
you
well
know
very
important
rights
can
be
lost
prior
with
the
--
many
days,
many
weeks
prior
to
the
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
don't
we
--
we
come
down
to
the
question
as
to
dealing
with
the
constitution
that
concededly,
i
would
think
we'd
say
concededly,
everyone
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
at
the
trial
and
also
at
some
point
anterior
to
the
trial.
