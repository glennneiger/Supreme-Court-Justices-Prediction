now
you're
getting
pretty
close
to
the
--
to
the
rule
that
prevails
by
statute
in
india
where
no
statement
of
any
kind
by
a
person
in
custody
to
the
police
is
admissible
and
inevitable?
justice
tom
c.
clark
before
he
made
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
before
he
made
any
statement
at
all?
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
didn't
ask
for
a
counsel?
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
other
words
you'd
say
you'd
read
a
waiver
into
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
if
the
fbi
said,
“no,
we
can't
give
you
a
lawyer.
we
can't
find
you
a
lawyer.
we
don't
know
anybody
at
all.”
and
then
we
asked
him
to
go
ahead
and
make
a
statement
or
in
part
on
the
--
under
those
circumstances,
if
you
wish
to
go
ahead
you
may,
well,
that
would
be
--
would
you
say
that
would
be
a
waiver?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
then
he
just
said,
"well,
under
those
circumstances,
you
won't
take
any
statement."
justice
tom
c.
clark
“we
won't
interrogate
you”.
