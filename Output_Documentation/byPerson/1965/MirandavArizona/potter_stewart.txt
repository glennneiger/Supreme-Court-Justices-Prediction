justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
think
is
the
result
of
the
adversary
process
coming
into
being
when
this
focusing
takes
place?
what
follows
from
that?
is
there
then
a
--
what
--
a
right
to
what,
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
suppose,
if
you
really
mean
what
you
say
or
what
you
gather
from
what
the
escobe
--
from
what
the
escobedo
opinion
says,
the
adversary
process
starts
at
that
point
and
every
single
protection
of
the
constitution
then
comes
into
being,
does
it
not?
the
right
to
--
you
have
to
bring
a
jury
in
there,
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
without
taking
the
question.
my
question
is,
what
are
those
rights
when
this
focusing
begins?
are
these
all
the
panoply
of
rights
guaranteed
to
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
fully
understand
your
answer,
but
--
because
if
the
adversary
process
then
begins,
then
what
you
have
is
the
equivalent
of
a
trial,
do
you
not?
and
then
i
suppose
you
have
a
right
to
a
judge
and
a
jury
and
everything
else
that
goes
with
a
trial
right
then
and
there.
and
if
you
have
something
less
than
that,
then
you'd
--
then
this
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding,
then
you
don't
mean
what
you're
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
again
i
don't
mean
to
quibble,
and
i
apologize,
but
i
think
it's
first
important
to
define
what
those
rights
are,
what
his
rights
under
the
constitution
are
at
that
point.
he
can't
be
advised
of
his
rights
unless
somebody
knows
what
those
rights
are.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
a
lawyer
advise
him
that
his
rights
stand
where?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
it
that
confers
the
right
to
a
lawyer's
advice
at
that
point
and
not
--
and
not
on
an
earlier
point?
justice
potter
stewart
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
didn't
he
have
that
right
earlier?
justice
potter
stewart
before
this
became
a
so-called
“adversary
proceeding”
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
does
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
didn't
he
have
the
right
to
a
lawyer's
advice
earlier
then?
justice
potter
stewart
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
i
don't
understand
the
magic
in
this
phrase
of
“focusing”
that
all
of
a
sudden
it
becomes
an
adversary
proceeding.
and
then
i
suppose
if
you
literally
mean
that
it
becomes
an
adversary
proceeding
then
you're
entitled
to
all
the
rights
that
the
defendant
is
given
under
our
constitution
at
a
criminal
trial.
and
if
you
mean
less
than
that,
then
it
--
then
you
don't
really
mean,
its
now
become
the
equivalent
of
a
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
claim
in
this
case
that
this
confession
was
compelled,
was
involuntary?
justice
potter
stewart
none
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
talk
to
--
when
you
say
that
he
was
never
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel,
aren't
you,
(a)
begging
the
question,
and
(b)
giving
up
a
good
deal
of
your
position,
because
one
of
the
questions
here
is
does
he
have
a
right
to
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
and
the
gideon
against
wainwright
sense
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
well,
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
i
think
you're
--
you
lose
your
case,
period.
because
he
--
then,
it
was
the
duty
of
the
state
to
provide
him
one.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
he
asked
for
one.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
gideon
holds.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
to
affirmatively
waive
--
waived
it
then.
justice
potter
stewart
i
miss
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
misspoke
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
beginning
--
if
you're
right,
in
the
beginning
is
just
to
provide
him
a
lawyer
without
warning
him
or
telling
him
anything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
only
way
to
--
it's
the
only
way
to
satisfy
the
gideon
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
holding
and
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
--
what
should
this
warning
contain
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
talking
about
the
warning,
what
should
this
warning
be?
justice
potter
stewart
much
more
than
a
little
bit
of
a
quibble
on
the
basis
of
what
you
told
us
so
far?
justice
potter
stewart
much
more
than
a
little
bit
of
a
quibble,
i
should
think,
on
the
basis
of
what
you
argued
so
far,
that
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
a
lawyer
to
be
appointed
for
him
at
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
right
at
that
point.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
unless
he
waives
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
wouldn't
--
don't
quite
yet
understand
the
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
you.
what
should
the
warning
contain,
not
what
you
read
as
--
obviously.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
far
as
it
goes,
but
that's
not
enough,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
he's
not
entitled
to
a
lawyer
until
the
trial
begins.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
you
read
it
again
what
the
warning
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
you
now
say
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
would
you
not
say
it's
sufficient,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
other
words,
you
stop
right
there
and
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
was
sufficient.
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
there
be
a
waiver
if
these
are
--
these
are
absolute
constitutional
rights
of
the
importance
that
you
emphasize.
how
can
anybody
waive
them
without
the
consent
of
counsel,
without
the
advice
of
counsel?
didn't
he
have
a
lawyer
--
doesn't
he
need
a
lawyer
before
he
waive
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
waive
their
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
so
if
you're
right
it
would
seem
to
follow,
i
should
think,
that
he
needs
a
lawyer
before
he
can
waive
his
right
to
a
lawyer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
the
advice
of
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
you
would
follow
naturally
from
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
charge
so
far
as
an
--
charged
by
the
government
goes,
it's
a
--
usually
a
rather
formal
thing.
it's
an
indictment
or
it's
a
--
an
arraignment
on
a
charge
that
the
various
procedures
in
the
states
vary
but
that's
a
--
that's
an
identifiable
event
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
a
formal
event.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
what?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
what
they
do
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
five
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
that
book?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
it
felt
bound
to
reach
the
result
we
did
in
this
case
by
the
united
states
constitution
as
it
understood
that
constitution
had
been
interpreted
in
the
escobedo
decision,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
feel
itself
free
to
reach
any
other
conclusion
in
this
case
because
of
the
compulsion
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
the
house
was
full
of
stolen
goods,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
police
took
to
the
police
station
the
five
occupants
of
the
house.
justice
potter
stewart
in
his
case.
justice
potter
stewart
now
can't
the
escobedo
case
on
analysis
be
explained
in
precisely
the
terms
that
mr.
justice
black
is
suggesting.
after
all
escobedo
had
a
lawyer,
danny
escobedo
had
a
lawyer.
he
had
a
lawyer's
advice
and
the
lawyer
had
advised
him
not
to
talk
and
the
very
fact
that
escobedo
then
did
talk
after
he
was
confined
within
the
police
station,
it
was
a
very
clear
evidence
that
he'd
been
compelled
to
talk,
isn't
that
right
because
he
had
been
advised
by
a
lawyer
not
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
would
be
true
if
there
were
any
evidence
of
the
waiver
but
the
evidence
was
all
the
other
way.
he
kept
asking
to
see
this
lawyer
who
had
already
given
him
this
advice
which
was
evidence
that
he
did
not
waive
it,
did
not
intend
to
waive
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wasn't
trying
to
put
in
your
amount
any
totality
of
circumstances
really
because
i
know
that
you
don't
espouse
any
such
theory.
i
was
merely
trying
to
suggest
that
the
escobedo
decision
can
be
explained
in
terms
of
the
compulsion
of
a
compelled
confession
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
--
and
because
of
the
fact
that
he
did
have
a
lawyer
who
had
advised
him
not
to
talk.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
should
adopt
your
rule
--
your
proposal
as
i
understand
your
proposal
then
the
controversy
which
shifts
to
the
issue
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
investigatory
process
has
ceased
and
the
accusatory
process
had
began
whether
the
--
whether
they're
going
to
focus
and
certainly
that's
a
very
evanescent
kind
of
a
concept
to
try
to
pursue,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
not
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
it
isn't
the
rule.
a
rule
is
that
coerced
confessions
are
inadmissible
and
you
look
at
the
evidence
to
see
whether
the
confession
was
coerced
and
that's
i
suggest
that
at
least
as
workable
if
not
much
more
constitutionally
supportable
then
trying
to
chase
this
will
of
the
west
of
finding
out
when
there
had
been
a
focus.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
and
that
would
be
the
issue
in
the
--
if
your
proposal
should
be
accepted,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
beside
--
beside
excuse
me.
i
beg
your
pardon
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
are
you
answering
mr.
justice
fortas'
question?
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.

potter
