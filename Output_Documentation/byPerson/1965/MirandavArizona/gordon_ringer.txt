mr.
gordon
ringer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
this
case
presents
with
perhaps
more
poignancy
than
any
of
the
others
that
had
previously
been
argued
this
week.
it's
a
problem
of
determining
the
scope
of
the
investigative
powers
of
the
police
in
the
exercise
of
their
function
as
guardians
of
society
and
determining
the
scope
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
accused.
beginning
in
december
1962,
and
continuing
through
january
1963,
there
occurred
in
a
limited
area
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
a
series
of
extremely
brutal
crimes.
a
lady
named
mrs.
wells
on
her
way
home
from
work
on
december
21,
1962
was
waylaid,
robbed,
brutally
beaten
by
an
unknown
assailant
who
made
of
with
her
purse
and
its
contents.
later
on
with
mrs.
dixon
and
the
same
thing
occurred
to
her.
mrs.
mitchell
was
waylaid
near
her
home
and
struck
down
and
killed
and
her
possessions
were
taken.
mrs.
miyauchi
on
her
way
to
work
in
the
early
morning
was
similarly
accosted
and
her
possession
is
taken.
and
finally,
a
miss
ramirez
on
the
day
before
the
arrest
of
the
respondent
here,
suffered
to
similar
occurrence.
in
the
case
of
mrs.
mitchell,
the
victim
died.
and
the
case
of
the
other
victims,
they
suffered
long
hospitalization
periods.
they
were
fractured
skulls,
fractured
jaws,
losses
of
equilibrium,
and
certainly
an
inability
to
identify
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime.
whoever
this
person
was,
he
made
one
mistake.
with
the
assistance
of
a
lady
named
lena
franklin,
he
negotiated
some
checks
which
had
been
stolen
from
mrs.
wells
at
a
market.
this
occurred
on
the
22nd
of
january
1963,
the
negotiation
of
the
checks.
on
the
30th,
the
officers
learned
that
he
had
done
so.
on
the
31st,
they
located
lena
franklin.
upon
locating
her
they
went
with
her
to
find
the
person
who
has
been
introduced
to
her
as
roy
wells,
the
person
who
cashed
the
checks.
she
did
not
know
the
address.
she
did
know
what
the
house
had
looked
like
because
she'd
been
there.
they
went
there.
they
saw
the
respondent
on
the
front
porch.
they
called
out
his
name,
roy
wells,
the
name
he'd
signed
to
the
checks.
he
went
inside
the
house.
they
followed
him,
they
entered,
they
arrested
him
for
a
series
of
purse
snatch
robberies,
and
they
came
upon
[inaudible].
mr.
gordon
ringer
they
came
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
ringer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor
if
i
--
i
have
a
habit
of
not
knowing
whether
i'm
talking
loud
enough.
upon
entering
the
house
and
searching
it,
incident
to
the
arrest
which
was
a
lawfully
arrest
and
it
has
never
been
challenge,
the
officers
found
a
great
deal
of
stolen
property.
they
found
particular
items
of
property
which
have
been
taken
from
each
of
the
individual
victims
with
the
robbery
or
murder
at
home,
that
the
respondent
here
was
subsequently
charged.
in
addition,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
arresting
officers,
they
found
a
number
of
other
purses
and
a
number
of
other
wallets
whose
providence
is
not
identified
in
this
record.
in
the
house
were
five
persons.
the
respondent
stewart,
his
mistress
or
wife
as
the
case
maybe,
his
niece,
a
lady
named
jacky
jackson,
and
two
other
gentlemen.
at
the
time
of
this
arrest,
search
and
seizure,
the
officers
had
no
means
of
knowing
other
than
perhaps
a
bland
suspicion
perhaps,
that
the
same
person
had
committed
all
these
offenses.
they
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
this
was
not
a
ring
of
the
five
people
who
were
all
in
this
house
at
the
same
time.
and
this
is
certainly
different
than
the
type
of
situation
envisioned
by
the
chief
justice
yesterday
where
the
police
get
a
vague
description
of
somebody
and
pick
up
90
people
who
looked
like
them
and
take
them
down
to
the
police
station.
so
these
persons
were
taken,
arrested,
taken
to
the
police
station.
mr.
gordon
ringer
all
five
of
them,
yes.
that's
in
the
record.
the
defendant
stewart,
lillian
lara,
a
man
named
burnam,
a
man
named
evans,
jacky
jackson,
the
niece
of
the
defendant
stewart.
during
the
ensuing
five
days,
before
the
production
of
stewart
before
a
magistrate,
he
was
questioned
as
the
record
shows.
the
record
shows
also
the
amount
and
the
length
of
the
questioning,
approximately
a
total
of
two
hours
and
45
minutes
or
two
hours
and
46
minutes
as
the
case
maybe.
this
was
the
total
amount
of
the
questioning.
there's
no
claim
here
he
was
questioned
at
late
hours
continually
by
relays
of
police.
there's
no
claim
here
that
he
was
denied
access
to
anybody
he
wanted
to
see
whether
a
wife,
or
a
friend,
or
a
relative,
or
counsel,
or
bondsman
or
whatever.
there
was
indeed
a
claim
of
coercion
at
the
trial,
a
claim
which
was
i
would
suggest
devoid
of
substance.
mr.
gordon
ringer
it
is
devoid
of
substance,
a
claim
solely
that
the
common
law
–
that
the
confession
by
the
defendant
was
given
in
return
for
a
promise
to
release
lillian
lara,
this
was
rebutted
by
the
officers.
the
questions
here
are
whether
antecedently
to
the
giving
of
his
confession,
the
police
were
constitutionally
obliged
to
give
stewart
a
warning
of
a
right
to
remain
silent
and
a
right
to
consult
counsel.
there
is
a
second
issue
which
was
raised
by
mr.
norris
in
his
brief;
a
claim
that
there
was
an
unlawful
delay
in
the
arraignment
and
because
there
was
an
unlawful
delay
in
the
arraignment,
the
confession
being
according
to
mr.
norris,
the
product
of
that
unlawful
delay,
the
confession
should
also
have
been
excluded.
i
will
address
myself
first
to
the
first
point.
as
suggested
in
the
briefs
and
this
is
a
good
phrase.
i
like
it
so
i
keep
saying
it.
this
case
is
a
grandchild
of
escobedo
and
a
child
of
dorado.
what
we
are
contesting
here
is
the
interpretation
which
the
california
supreme
court
placed
on
the
escobedo
case,
an
interpretation
of
which
the
california
supreme
court
in
dorado
and
by
extension
here
claimed
to
be
and
here,
i'm
thinking
perhaps
of
justice
black's
use
of
the
word
compelled
under
the
fifth
amendment.
that
they
said
that
we
are
compelled
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
to
hold
on
the
basis
of
the
escobedo
case
that
these
warnings
must
be
given,
these
rights
must
be
waived
otherwise
a
statement
no
matter
how
free
and
voluntary
it
may
otherwise
be,
may
not
be
received
in
evidence.
in
other
words,
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
that
there
is
a
generalized
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
which
emanates
from
circumstances
occurring
either
at
or
after
the
arrest
of
the
accused.
we
believe
that
the
true
interpretation
of
escobedo
is
the
interpretation
which
was
suggested
by
questioning
in
oral
argument
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
harlan
that
it
is
a
totality
of
circumstances
case
continually
throughout
that
decision
in
it's
limited
holding.
escobedo
speaks
of
under
the
circumstances
here
where
as
here
under
the
facts
as
here
and
certainly
in
that
case
which
was
the
de
--
involved
the
denial
of
a
request
to
consult,
retain,
counsel
by
a
person
whose
attorney
was
on
the
outside
trying
to
get
in
at
the
same
time.
this
was
an
affirmative
act
of
denial
by
the
state
under
the
circumstances
as
found
by
this
court.
we
do
not
therefore
read
escobedo
as
our
supreme
court
has
done,
as
creating
in
any
individual,
a
kind
of
in
coed
executory
interest
which
vests
at
the
time
of
arrest.
it's
been
suggested
and
in
here,
i'm
thinking
of
an
article
which
mr.
justice
fortas
wrote
several
years
ago,
that
the
right
to
counsel
begins
at
the
time
of
arrest
because
at
that
time
the
adversary
system
commences.
now
does
it?
we
believe,
as
does
the
solicitor
general,
that
a
certain
amount
of
questioning
is
a
social
necessity.
that
is
not
only
because
some
prosecutors
may
say,
“we
must
have
confession
but
also
because
questioning
serves
both
an
inculpatory
and
exculpatory
purpose
and
let
me
if
i
can
find
in
my
notes,
bring
out
a
few
statistics
which
i
think
will
make
this
point.
these
facts
are
contained
in
“crime
in
california”,
a
very
compendious
book
which
is
issued
by
the
california
bureau
of
criminal
justice
--
criminal
statistics
department
of
justice.
in
1964,
there
were
approximately
100,000,
a
little
over
arrest
for
felony
in
california.
of
these,
27.5%
were
arrested
by
department
were
released
without
the
charge.
these
are
men
who
were
either
determined
to
be
innocent
by
the
police
or
determined
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
even
seek
a
complaint
from
the
district
attorney.
mr.
gordon
ringer
27.5%
were
released.
of
those
arrested
for
robbery,
43.1%
were
released.
of
those
arrested
for
burglary,
31%
were
released.
mr.
gordon
ringer
released.
those
arrested
for
aggravated
assault,
28.2%
were
released.
homicide
and
that
is
the
most
serious
conceivable
charge,
20.8%.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
overall,
27.5%
and
it
would
be
of
assistance
to
the
court,
i
have
a
copy
of
the
book.
i
don't
know
if
it's
available
in
your
library
but
may
i
lodge
it.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
don't
have
an
extra
copy
for
mr.
norris
here
but
if
they're
not
available
in
his
library,
then
we
could
furnish
him
with
the
copy.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
lowest
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
it's
called
“crime
in
california”.
it's
compiled
by
the
bureau
of
criminal
statistics,
division
of
law
enforcement
california
department
of
justice.
the
particular
table
i'm
concerned
with
is
on
page
49.
it's
table,
iii/7.
the
lowest
percentage
of
releases
and
i
think
this
is
significant
forgery
and
check
offenses
which
i
think
all
will
agree
are
the
type
of
offenses
where
an
investigation
after
an
arrest
is
the
least
necessary.
i
write
a
check
on
a
bank
in
which
i
have
no
account.
the
check
is
dishonored.
you
check
with
the
bank
and
you
find
out
i
have
no
account.
there
is
the
offense
and
the
need
to
investigate
after
an
arrest
on
probable
cause
is
a
minimal
importance.
in
all
of
these
other
matters
that
i've
laid
out,
something
that
occurred
after
the
arrest,
based
on
probable
cause,
resulted
in
the
release
of
the
man.
we
do
not
know
whether
these
gentlemen
had
counsel
in
the
police
station
or
not.
there's
no
way
of
knowing
or
cross
checking,
but
certainly
questioning
by
the
police
must
be
regarded
as
having
played
a
significant
factor
in
the
decision
not
to
charge.
i
do
not
know
how
significant
the
factor
because
we
cannot
empirically
go
to
that
much
more
deeply.
but
i
think
this
makes
my
point,
that
questioning
serves
a
dual
purpose
not
merely
to
get
confession
because
we've
got
to
have
confessions
in
all
cases,
but
it
does
serve
the
police
function
of
bringing
the
charge
in
trial
of
those
against
whom
there
is
evidence
sufficient
to
justify
such
establishment
and
not
bringing
the
charge
of
those
who
are
not
guilty
and
should
be
released.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
ringer
again
your
honor,
i've
no
means
of
knowing
but
let
me
make
that
--
let
me
accept
that
for
the
purpose
of
argument
because
i
believe
you
are
--
you
are
intending
to
raise
a
question
which
you
raised
earlier
in
the
--
in
the
other
arguments.
let
us
assume
so.
i
think
the
tenor
of
your
honor's
question
yesterday
based
on
the
fifth
amendment
were
simply
that
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
your
honor
interprets
it,
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
under
malloy
and
hogan,
a
statement
made
by
a
person
who
is
under
arrest
and
in
the
police
station
is
a
statement
which
is
compelled
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that
was
the
drift
of
the
questioning
and
the
point
which
you
were
putting
to
counsel.
secondly,
i
think
your
honor
was
also
concerned
with
the
number
of
escobedo
cases,
it
would
have
to
be
determined
by
somebody
unless
there
were
a
simple
and
easy
to
follow
tests
for
determining
the
admissibility
of
confessions.
i
talked
to
the
solicitor
general
on
sunday
and
was
informed
that
there
are/or
have
been
this
term
170
escobedo
cases
which
either
are
now
pending
or
have
been
pending.
mr.
gordon
ringer
here
and
there
are
probably
thousands
more
elsewhere.
mr.
gordon
ringer
but
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
inference
i
would
draw
is
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
are
contending,
they're
improperly
convicted.
i
draw
no
other
inference
from
that
because
i
have
not
examined
the
facts
of
any
of
the
cases.
but
to
get
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
would
say
so.
i
would
say
so
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that
had
not
occurred
to
me.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that
depends
upon
the
--
that
depends
upon
the
facts
of
those
cases
and
that's
exactly
the
point
i'd
like
to
make,
justice
black
and
i
think
i'm
sort
of
bouncing
off
the
question
by
justice
harlan
or
a
comment
by
justice
harlan
that
was
made
yesterday
in
our
argument.
that
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
any
statement
in
any
case,
that
is
all
statements
in
all
cases
made
by
the
accused
who
has
been
arrested
on
probable
cause
and
taken
down
at
the
station
is
necessarily
by
virtue
of
the
fact
of
arrest
and
detention
alone
a
compelled
statement.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
think
it's
a
question
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
do
not
deny
that,
no.
but
this
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
let
me
--
let
me
suggest
this.
i
think
that
it's
a
question
of
fact
depending
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
each
individual
case
just
as
under
the
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes
but
if
the
--
if
the
provision
--
the
provision
of
the
constitution
simply
says
no
person
maybe
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
and
it
doesn't
suggest
any
particular
circumstances
in
which
he
is
or
is
not
its
compendious
terminology
which
must
be
understood
in
the
context
to
particular
facts.
now
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
what
about
--
yes,
under
legal
process,
yes.
that
is
if
the
gun
is
pointed
at
me,
i
don't
have
much
choice.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
would
accept
that.
i
would
accept
that,
but
your
honor,
i
would
still
--
i
would
still
suggest
that
it
would
be
a
factual
question
in
each
particular
case
just
as
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
is
a
specific
constitutional
guarantee,
the
question
whether
a
particular
search
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
i
don't
have
the
exact
wording
in
mind.
mr.
gordon
ringer
it
says
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
gordon
ringer
alright,
there's
a
difference
between
reasonable
and
unreasonable.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
they
deal
with
different
things
but
the
thing
i
want
to
make
your
honor
is
this.
that
here
you
have
a
specific
term
of
art
in
the
fourth
amendment
which
is
applied
to
the
states.
you
can't
have
an
unreasonable
search
and
you
have
an
exclusionary
role.
and
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is,
that
even
there
is
this
specific
constitutional
guarantee,
it's
a
question
of
fact
in
each
individual
case.
probable
cause
is
base
on
the
facts.
mr.
gordon
ringer
probable
cause
is
based
on
the
facts
of
each
individual
case
and
i
would
suggest
and
this
ties
in
also
with
the
--
with
the
sixth
amendment
interpretation
of
escobedo
because
the
farthest
reach
which
has
been
given
to
escobedo
that
we
know
of
is
that
of
a
california
supreme
court
which
by
the
inherent
force
of
the
logic
of
its
own
decisions
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
vests
at
the
time
of
arrest.
and
under
the
decisions
as
set
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
a
certain
pattern
that
once
you
start
with
that
presumption,
i
--
i
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
necessarily
you
do
bring
the
members
of
the
grand
jury
into
the
--
that
you
bring
the
members
of
the
grand
jury
physically
into
the
police
station,
but
the
only
statements
which
can
be
admitted
under
the
california
rule
are
those
which
are
either
completely
volunteered
by
the
defendant.
in
other
words,
when
the
officer
comes
up
to
me,
i
pull
out
the
gun
that
i
used
and
said,
“this
is
the
gun
i
used,
i
am
the
man
you
want”,
or
those
statements
which
under
the
california
courts'
construction
of
escobedo
are
made
where
there's
a
possibility
of
victim
they'd
still
be
alive
and
there
is
a
compelling
necessity
to
find
the
victim.
and
so
you
find
the
powers
of
the
police
to
investigate
either
for
inculpatory
purposes
or
exculpatory
purposes
reduced
to
this
point
that
unless
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
victim
might
still
be
alive,
you
can't
question.
and
the
other
exception
is
a
statement
can
be
received
in
evidence
if
the
defendants
remorse
strikes
him
so
quickly,
so
quickly,
that
he
begins
to
blurt
things
out.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gordon
ringer
as
a
general
principle,
i
would
suggest
no
however
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
i
don't
know
your
honor
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
that
question
is
antecedent
to
something
that
has
to
do
with
this
case.
i
will
agree
to
police
should
not.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
agree
without
qualification,
that
is
true.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
because
arrest
must
be
made
on
probable
cause.
mr.
gordon
ringer
one
would
assume
so,
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
we've
understood
and
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
at
critical
stages
of
the
state
proceedings
which
followed
the
formal,
the
filing
of
formal
charges.
escobedo
said
bringing
the
time
back
prior
to
the
filing
of
formal
charges,
that
if
a
man
has
an
attorney
who
he
wants
to
see
and
he
wants
to
see
that
attorney,
the
police
have
no
right
to
keep
them
apart
and
that's
a
principle
with
which
we
agree
wholeheartedly.
mr.
gordon
ringer
if
it
please
the
court,
we
don't
believe
and
we've
perhaps
--
we've
argued
this
i
think
perhaps
with
some
vigor
in
our
brief
that
the
equal
protection
principles
apply
this
far
back.
and
i
think
this
was
suggested
by
justice
black
yesterday
in
a
question,
“do
the
principles
of
griffin
versus
illinois
apply
to
the
state?”
we
would
suggest
they
do
not.
society
is
full
of
inequities
and
inequalities
of
all
sizes,
sorts,
and
shapes
and
we
suggest
that
these
principles
do
not
apply
at
this
particular
stage.
mr.
gordon
ringer
because
we've
--
i've
always
understood
and
if
i'm
wrong
please
i'm
subject
to
correction,
that
in
the
judicial
process,
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
on
the
appellate
stage
certainly,
that's
the
right
of
a
poor
man
to
have
a
transcript,
the
right
of
a
poor
man
to
get
a
brief
on
appeal.
everybody
is
entitled
to
counsel
at
trial
and
there
are
only
a
few
states
who
did
not
conceive
that
prior
to
getty.
we
agree
that
the
critical
stages
of
the
state
proceedings
which
followed
the
filing
of
formal
charges
that
he's
entitled
to
counsel
as
a
matter
of
right,
but
the
question
is
not
so
much
whether
he
should
have
a
lawyer
in
the
station
house
with
him,
sitting
beside
him
during
interrogation
or
whether
he
could
telephone,
but
whether
the
state
is
constitutionally
oblige
to
advice
him
that
he
has
a
right
to
consult
an
attorney
before
being
questioned
by
the
police.
and
that's
the
fundamental
question
in
the
case
to
which
we
suggest
the
answer
should
be
in
the
negative.
i
don't
know
whether
that
answered
your
question
your
honor
but
i
have
attempted
to.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well,
may
i
ask
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
well,
that's
a
flash.
i
think
what
stewart
needed
in
this
case
more
than
a
lawyer
or
anything
else
is
something
no
longer
he
could
give
in
and
that's
a
convincing
explanation
that
would
exculpate
him
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
a
convincing
explanation
that
would
exculpate
him
of
how
that
property
came
to
be
in
his
house.
i
would
suggest
that.
mr.
gordon
ringer
we
think
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
that's
part
of
it.
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
don't
say
he
has
a
constitutional
obligation
that
exculpate
himself.
i
suggest
that
was
his
greatest
need
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
again,
there
are
perhaps
times
where
he
might,
but
the
question
here,
the
question
again
and
i
do
not
--
i
wish
to
--
perhaps
i
wish
to
focus
to
use
a
phrase
on
the
way
we
deal
with
the
problem
and
i
keep
returning
that
if
the
person
doesn't
know
he
can
consult
with
a
lawyer.
mr.
gordon
ringer
if
a
person
doesn't
know
he
consult
--
can
consult
with
the
lawyer.
mr.
gordon
ringer
if
he
doesn't
know
that
he
doesn't
have
to
talk;
these
are
factors
which
go
to
whether
his
statements
are
voluntary.
these
are
factors
which
can't
be
considered
at
the
trial,
be
considered
on
appellate
review
as
part
of
a
totality
of
circumstances
in
determining
whether
a
man
has
been
denied
due
process
of
law
at
his
trial.
and
we
suggest
the
test
is
a
compendious
one
which
requires
i'm
sure
a
considerable
degree
of
analysis
with
the
facts
of
particular
cases,
but
that
it
is
a
test
which
this
court
should
adopt
as
the
test
for
determining
admissibility.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
there
again,
this
raises
a
problem,
mr.
justice
warren,
a
problem
which
i
--
how's
my
time?
this
raises
a
problem
which
was
suggested
in
our
brief
that
if
he
has
a
right
to
a
warning,
then
he
has
the
right
which
must
be
waived,
is
that
not
true?
that's
quite
clear,
that
follows.
if
there's
a
warning,
there
must
be
a
waiver.
now
let
us
suppose
that
so
and
so
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
he
is
read
his
rights
as
under
the
dorado
decision.
he
said
you
have
a
right
not
to
say
anything,
anything
you
say
maybe
use
against
you.
you
have
a
right
to
consult
an
attorney
before
you
speak
to
us
or
--
or
at
any
particular
time
in
addition.
then
the
defendant
either
remains
silent,
nods
his
head,
exercises
one
or
the
other
of
these
rights.
or,
he
says
words,
“thanks,
i
know
that”,
or
something.
in
any
rate,
he
makes
some
reply.
if
a
waiver
is
required,
the
test
of
waiver
is
the
johnson
and
zerbst
test,
a
knowing
an
intelligent
waiver
of
these
rights
and
the
very
factors
which
are
involved
in
a
determination
whether
a
right
has
been
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
are
those
which
go
to
voluntaries.
if
the
man
is
a
mental
defective,
the
policemen
may
not
know
this
and
even
the
man,
he
may
read
his
rights
to
someone
and
someone
may
say,
“alright,
i'll
go
ahead
and
talk.”
at
the
trial,
perhaps
years
later
on
collateral
attack,
it
will
come
out
that
this
person
was
one
who
is
incapable
of
waiving
his
rights
and
so
you
are
imparting
complicated
principles
of
waiver
that
are
difficult
enough
to
determine
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
trial,
and
i'm
thinking
here
of
henry
and
mississippi
where
you
couldn't
tell
from
the
record
of
a
trial
whether
there
was
a
knowing
waiver
of
a
particular
right
to
object
to
particular
evidence.
you
were
imparting
these
concepts
into
the
police
station,
mr.
justice
warren
and
you're
putting
them
on
the
shoulders
of
police
who
are
not
sophisticated
experts
in
the
criminal
law
and
particularly
not
sophisticated
experts
in
problems
of
waiver
in
constitutional
law.
mr.
gordon
ringer
they
certainly
should
have
afforded
him
an
opportunity
to
get
a
lawyer
if
he
wants
some.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
a
request
for
help,
isn't
it
mr.
justice
warren?
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
think
they
should
afford
him
that
opportunity
before
going
any
farther.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
think
he
should
do
that.
he
has
the
right
under
--
under
the
haynes
case
to
call
his
wife.
if
you
remember
the
haynes
case
and
that
was
suggested
in
our
argument
by
the
solicitor
yesterday
that
escobedo
is
the
lawyer
equivalent
to
the
wife
in
the
haynes.
i
think
he
should
be
afforded
that
opportunity
and
the
statutes
of
california
provided
even
before
the
escobedo
case.
i'm
referring
specifically
to
section
851
of
the
penal
code
of
the
state
of
california
provided
that
upon
arrest,
upon
arrest
and
booking
and
no
later
than
three
hours
after
arrest
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
make
several
phone
calls
to
a
person
who
maybe
his
relative,
his
friend,
his
attorney,
his
bondsman
or
whatever
and
these
were
liberally
construed
in
practice.
if
he
didn't
have
the
money
to
make
the
call,
he
would
be
given
a
dime
or
whatever
it
took
of
public
expense.
i
would
like
--
since
i
don't
wish
to
discuss
another
problem
in
the
rebuttal
that
i've
not
mentioned
before,
i
would
simply
--
because
i
wish
to
reserve
time,
mention
the
contention
under
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states.
there
is
a
claim
made
by
mr.
norris
that
there
was
an
illegal
detention
here
which
would
render
inadmissible
the
statement
which
was
made
by
stewart
on
the
last
day
of
his
detention.
we
submit
that
the
detention
was
lawful
within
the
statute
of
california
section
825
whose
constitutionality
has
not
been
challenged
by
mr.
norris.
on
that
basis,
i
would
wish
to
submit
my
opening
--
submit
my
opening
argument
and
then
wait
for
mr.
norris
to
reply.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes
sir,
there's
no
question
about
that.
there
can
be
no
question.
now
this
stewart
case
is
the
third
--
the
third
case
on
this
point
in
the
california
supreme
court.
first
was
dorado
in
which
they
stated
they
were
compelled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
so
hold.
the
second
was
in
the
case
of
modesto,
the
third
is
stewart
and
stewart
cites
dorado
and
it's
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
think
i
understand
the
distinction.
it
is
one
which
i
do
not
think
can
be
made
because
all
of
the
ramifications
of
the
dorado
rule
which
stem
from
escobedo
are
stated
by
the
california
supreme
court
to
be
emanations
in
the
--
from
the
dorado
--
from
the
escobedo
case
as
they
conceive
it.
and
these
are
applications,
they're
not
state
rules
of
evidence,
and
they
aren't
regarded
by
the
california
supreme
court
state
rules
of
evidence.
they're
regarded
as
constitutional
compulsions
as
well.
i
think
that
answers
your
question.
i
hope
it
does
--
i
hope
that
satisfies
of
what
we
--
your
view
of
what
we
believe
that
the
california
supreme
court
is
done
here.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
that
is
our
position
which
is
all
i
was
attempting
to
say.
mr.
gordon
ringer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
making
one
preliminary
point
which
has
no
relevance
whatever
to
the
case,
i
think,
but
it
was
not
injected
by
mr.
norris,
the
crimes
nor
the
arrest
of
mr.
stewart
occurred
in
the
watts
area,
so
i
don't
think
we
find
in
this
case
the
emotional
aura
that
is
associated
with
that
subject.
this
was
some
six
miles
north
of
watts.
secondly,
i
think
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
when
the
officers
arrived
at
mr.
stewart's
house,
they
found
a
house
full
of
stolen
goods
which
were
not
limited
to
the
exhibits
which
were
introduced
in
evidence
at
this
trial.
it's
been
conceded
by
mr.
norris
that
stewart
was
arrested
on
probable
cause
and
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
lillian
lara
were
arrested
on
probable
cause
at
the
very
moment.
now
it's
true
that
the
record
as
to
the
other
three
men
is
totally
indeterminate
as
to
--
from
the
existence
of
probable
cause
although
they
were
in
a
house
which
is
full
of
stolen
goods
but
this
would
seem
to
follow
the
record
being
indeterminate
precisely
because
it
was
stewart
who
was
on
trial
and
not
these
other
people.
and
so
there
was
no
occasion
to
go
into
the
–
no
occasion,
to
go
into
the
other
circumstances
involving
them.
out
of
this
116
hours
delay
before
the
taking
of
mr.
stewart,
before
the
magistrate,
we've
already
pointed
out
the
total
time
of
interrogation,
consumed
was
less
than
three
hours,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
investigating
officers,
all
of
the
other
persons
involved
were
questioned
about
these
exhibits
as
well
as
the
other
exhibits
that
were
found
in
the
house.
the
ultimate
question
in
this
and
i
think
in
any
case
involving
the
introduction
and
evidence
of
a
confession
or
incriminating
statement
of
the
accused
is
whether
it
was
coerced.
i
mentioned
at
the
opening
argument
there
was
an
issue
at
trial
with
coercion
which
was
strictly
limited
to
a
claim
that
the
officers
have
promised
to
release
lillian
and
return
for
his
confession
after
he
confessed
and
that
she
was
released
and
that
this
was
rebutted.
the
other
claims
that
have
been
made
by
mr.
norris,
i
think,
are
as
follows.
that
fundamentally,
that
this
man
was
--
this
man
made
a
confession
which
should
not
have
been
received
in
evidence
against
him
because
the
right
to
counsel
attached
even
upon
arrest.
we
have
already
stated
our
views
as
to
the
escobedo
decision.
we
understand
of
course
that
there
is
a
conflict
in
opinion
among
the
various
jurisdictions
as
to
the
meaning
and
scope
of
escobedo.
we
suggest,
however,
that
our
interpretation
of
it,
that
it's
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
case
is
the
proper
and
the
correct
one.
the
next
point
i'd
like
to
bring
out
is
this.
that
the
--
this
case
differs
from
the
other
four
that
were
before
this
court,
in
that
in
each
of
the
other
cases,
when
the
police
a
man
they
arrested
him
because
of
a
certain
specific
crime
and
any
statement
that
was
taken
was
about
a
certain
specific
crime
that
they've
arrested
him
for.
the
officers
went
here
having
prob
--
went
to
his
house
have
probable
cause,
they
believe
that
he
committed
at
least
before
jury
of
the
whales
check.
they
discovered
all
of
these
other
property
which
led
an
envisioned
the
thought
of
his
possible
implication
in
the
series
of
other
brutal
crimes,
including
murder.
had
they
not
questioned
him,
there
would
have
been
no
way
to
bring
home
to
him
or
to
anyone
else
in
the
world
these
crimes
and
the
police
would
have
been
required
simply
to
do
this
to
take
the
exhibits
which
were
found,
return
them
to
the
victims
and
to
say,
we
think
or
we
have
a
suspicion
that
your
act
was
murdered
by
this
gentleman,
that
you
were
beaten
by
this
gentleman,
and
that
would
an
end
of
the
case.
there
would
be
a
certain
social
cause,
a
considerable
social
cause.
you're
dealing
in
this
type
of
case
was
an
unwitnessed
homicide
where
there
are
no
fingerprints,
no
technical
leads,
no
magnetic
evidence,
no
electronic
evidence,
no
scientific
evidence
of
any
kind
and
there
are
certain
kinds
of
crimes
which
can
only
be
solved
by
asking
questions.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
whatever
rule
that
your
honors
will
adopt
will
be
one
for
unwitnessed
crimes
and
another
for
witnessed
crimes,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
in
determining
further
stewart's
conviction
was
properly
obtained
and
whether
stewart's
confession
was
properly
received
in
evidence
that
these
factors
should
be
taken
into
account.
as
for
the
emphasis
of
mr.
norris
upon
the
secrecy
of
the
interrogation,
i
think
we
can
take
the
word
secrecy
too
far.
this
man
was
in
jail.
there's
no
question
about
it
and
he
wasn't
invited
by
seven
armed
officers.
he
was
arrested
and
taken
into
jail.
but
there's
no
--
nothing
in
the
record
and
no
claim
made
here
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
see
anybody
he
wanted
to
see.
in
fact,
he
wanted
to
see
lillian
lara,
his
girlfriend
or
his
wife,
whatever
you
want
to
call
her.
he
wanted
to,
he
asked
to
and
he
did.
and
he
even
claimed
that
she
came
to
see
him
a
second
time
which
the
officers
denied
having
incurred.
there
was
we
submit
on
the
facts
of
this
case
no
compulsion
in
the
constitutional
sense
whether
we
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
coercion
or
from
the
point
of
view
of
--
of
the
point
of
view
of
the
--
of
the
point
of
view
of
fifth
amendment.
with
respect
to
the
state
statute,
we
submit
the
statute
was
complied
within
this
case,
was
complied
within
this
case
and
to
hold
it
was
not
where
you
would
take
a
rather
giant
leap.
the
argument
is
based
on
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states
and
this
is
--
i
would
suppose
a
--
a
rather
muted,
a
rather
muted
argument
under
mcnabb
and
mallory.
the
mallory
rule
is,
i
think,
is
generally
recognized,
it's
a
rule
arising
under
the
super
missouri
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
it's
never
been
suggested
in
any
opinion
in
this
court
that
it's
a
rule
of
constitutional
dimension.
so
you
--
in
order
to
apply
it
to
the
state,
you
would
have
to
take
pretty
giant
step
and
then
of
course,
it's
a
decision
for
you
as
to
make.
it's
for
mine
perhaps
to
contravene
and
say
it
should
not
be
done
for
mr.
norris
to
urge,
that's
your
decision.
it's
a
pretty
giant
step
to
take.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
in
this
case?
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
my
view
is
that
there
is
no
generalized
sixth
amendment's
right
to
counsel.
there
was
a
denial
of
assistance
who
counsel
in
escobedo
because
the
state
did
affirmatively
deny
him
counsel.
mr.
gordon
ringer
what
i'm
--
what
i
wish
to
say
in
reply
to
your
question,
i
hope
you
will
not
construe
as
a
sort
of
getting
away
from
it.
what
i
say
is
in
determining
the
inadmissibility
of
this
confession
whether
or
not
a
warning
was
given
as
a
factor
among
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
this
is
a
test
proposed
by
the
--
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief.
but
i
do
not
mean
to
concede
or
to
suggest
that
that
would
be
the
dispositive
factor.
it
would
simply
be
a
factor
in
determining
voluntariness
because
the
ultimate
test
is
one
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
ringer
of
the
statements
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
voluntariness
of
a
statement
made
by
the
--
of
a
statement
made
by
a
person
to
the
arresting
or
investigating
officer.
mr.
gordon
ringer
correct.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that
is
true.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
there
are
--
may
i
meditate
on
that
for
a
moment.
the
typical
indeed
the
only
cases
of
the
coerced
confession
that
we're
familiar
with
in
the
records
of
this
court
or
in
the
records
of
our
own
courts
are
cases
in
which
the
police
did
something
whether
physically
or
psychologically
which
under
the
traditional
concept
of
due
process
broke
this
man's
will
or
whatever
other
formulation
maybe
chosen
to
use
in
a
particular
case
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
certainly
the
absence
of
a
warning
or
the
absence
of
counsel
would
not
standing
alone
render
a
confession
involuntary
in
the
classic
sense,
but
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
particular
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
totality
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
totality
of
circumstances
is
a
catch
phrase
which
means
that
the
court
looks
at
all
of
the
facts.
and
i
suppose
you
can
attach
too
much
significance
to
the
particular
use
a
catch
phrase.
but
what
i
wish
to
say
is
simply
that
the
usual
test
of
the
coerced
confession,
the
usual
test
of
admissibility
is
one
of
coercion
and
that
unless
you
can
say
before
some
specific
statement
is
made
as
in
this
case
or
in
some
other
case,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
specifically
attached
then
the
test
does
remain
one
of
voluntariness
in
the
traditional
sense.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
it's
not
this
of
the
rule
which
is
propounded
in
the
solicitor's
brief
in
which
i
am
suggesting
you.
it's
not
necessarily
in
advance
and
whether
--
whether
there
should
be
an
advance
or
a
stand
--
certainly
no
one
claims
there
should
be
retreat,
but
the
question
is
whether
there
should
be
an
advance
or
whether
the
rule
is
compendiously
formulated
there
is
the
proper
one.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
if
it
please
the
court,
i
can't
deny
that
there
are
men
of
great
honor
and
integrity,
men
in
my
court
to
believe
it
does
have
implications
and
there
is
of
course,
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
implications
it
has.
but
we
do
regard
the
escobedo
case
as
having
said
what
it
meant
and
meant
what
it
said.
whether
we
do
regard
the
rule
contended
for
by
mr.
norris
as
an
extension
and
if
you
believe
it
should
be
extended,
you
sit
here
as
a
court
to
extend
it
if
the
question
is
whether
it
should
be.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
they
did.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
if
your
honor
please,
as
i
deter
to
point
out,
stewart
and
lillian
were
arrested
on
probable
cause
and
as
to
the
others
we
have
an
indeterminate
record.
mr.
gordon
ringer
we
have
an
indeterminate
record
as
to
the
other
three
people.
i
can't
make
any
assertion
one
way
or
another.
what
grounds
of
suspicion
of
these
three
people
the
officers
had
when
they
went
there
or
got
when
they
talked
to
these
people
or
did
whatever
they
did
at
the
premises.
you
see,
i
don't
know
the
answers
to
those
questions.
mr.
gordon
ringer
as
that
may
well
be
true
your
honor,
i'm
simply
in
no
position
to
affirm
or
deny
because
i
don't
know
and
the
record
doesn't
tell
us.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
would
assume
that
case
--
california
had
an
exclusionary
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
if
your
honor
please,
i
believe
as
you
believe,
as
we
all
believe
that
an
arrest
must
be
based
on
probable
cause.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
last
time
i
was
here
three
years
ago
in
kerr
california
that
was
the
precise
question
before
the
court,
the
principle
of
which
everyone
agreed
upon.
all
i
say
is
that
california
has
the
exclusionary
rule
or
at
least
diversion
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
quite
similar
to
that
rule
many
years
before
kerr
and
before
mapp
and
before
kerr.
the
record
does
not
show
anything
other
than
that
they
were
there
and
that
this
house
was
full
of
property.
and
i
can
draw
no
presumption
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
that
because
the
issue
was
not
explored
at
trial.
this
was
the
trial
of
stewart
and
the
trial
whatever
the
investigation
did
the
trial
focus
on
him
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
except
as
counsel
for
either
side
might
have
chosen
to
bring
out
those
of
the
facts
which
they
wished
to.
and
so
i
can't
--
i
can
accept
the
principle
but
i
have
no
way
of
prejudging
or
post
judging
the
facts.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
believe
that
my
time
is
expired
but
i
wish
to
say
one
word.
mr.
gordon
ringer
this
case
is
unprecedented.
it
is
unprecedented
because
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
consented
at
the
request
of
the
state
to
review
a
judgment
of
reversal
in
a
state
criminal
case
involving
questions
other
than
statutory
of
constitutional
construction.
it's
not
normally
the
practice
of
counsel
who
thank
the
court
for
taking
over
the
case.
but
this
is
the
first
time
that's
been
done
to
my
knowledge
in
200
years
and
i
should
--
i
should
thank
the
court
for
hearing
our
side
and
contemplating
the
position
which
we
advanced.
