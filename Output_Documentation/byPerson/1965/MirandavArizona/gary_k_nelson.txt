mr.
gary
k.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
somewhat
caught
up
in
where
to
begin.
i
think
perhaps
the
first
and
most
important
--
to
one
of
the
most
important
things
to
say
right
now
is
concerning
mr.
flynn's
last
remarks.
i,
as
a
prosecutor,
even
of
only
short
duration,
take
serious
issue,
strenuous
--
strenuous
issues
i
can
take
before
this
court,
in
the
statement
that
it
will
take
another
46
years
in
the
state
of
arizona
for
the
right
to
counsel
to
become
full
blown.
i
just
simply
think
there
is
no
reason
for
that
statement
to
be
made.
if
there
is
any
reason
for
it
to
be
made
or
any
possible
justification
for
it
to
be
made
then
there
is
no
point
in
going
any
further.
one
issue
that
might
be
a
good
starting
point
is
concerning
the
description
of
the
arizona
court's
supposed
“off-the-cuff”
referral
to
or
ignoring
of
the
escobedo
decision,
or
the
attempt
to
avoid
it
clearly.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
opinion,
and
the
reading
of
it
shows
that
they
agreed
that
they
must
follow
this
court,
not
begrudgingly.
they
simply
stated
that
it's
a
fact.
and
then
in
exploring
the
case
of
escobedo,
the
case
of
miranda,
they
tried
to
find
out
what
happened
in
miranda,
what
the
case
of
escobedo
says,
and
apply
those
principles.
there's
no
attempt
to
avoid,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
read
it
implicitly
or
otherwise
in
the
arizona
court's
opinion.
clearly
they
did
not
base
it
on
a
request.
they
did
not
say
we
have
a,
b,
c,
d,
e
and
d
wasn't
present,
therefore
it's
not
controlling.
that
is
not
what
they
said.
they
said
many
courts
in
other
jurisdictions
had
gone
off
on
that
particular
area.
they
mentioned
that
as
a
factor,
but
they
discussed
hundreds
of
--
not
hundreds,
many
other
factors
in
miranda,
which
differentiated
it
from
escobedo.
to
get
to
the
facts
in
miranda,
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
record
that
mr.
miranda,
as
an
individual
defendant,
does
not
particularly
require
any
special
rule.
i
certainly
agree
with
justice
black
100%,
that
the
fifth
amendment,
the
sixth
amendment,
every
other
part
of
our
constitution
applies
to
everyone
--
poor,
rich,
ignorant,
intellectual,
what
have
you.
there
is
no
possible
basis
for
differentiation.
i
don't
argue
that.
i
don't
think
any
prosecutor
i've
note
argues
it.
but
miranda,
i
think,
characteristically
by
the
petitioner,
is
portrayed
in
this
light
in
an
attempt
to
make
something
that
isn't
there.
sure,
he
only
went
through
the
eighth
grade,
and
one
of
the
psychiatrist
said
that
he
had
an
emotional
illness.
i
might
say,
there
is
another
psychiatric
report.
it's
not
in
the
printed
record,
and
i
just
discovered
it
in
my
file,
but
it
is
in
the
record
before
this
court,
the
record
that
was
on
appeal,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
advert
to
that
psychiatric
report
also.
and
as
to
the
fact
that
mr.
miranda
could
not
have
made
the
statement
that
he
made,
i
just
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
for
alleging
that.
the
fact
that
he
uses
the
words,
the
medical
words
to
describe
the
male
and
female
sex
organ
rather
than
some
four-letter
vernacular
words
that
he
might
have
used,
this
doesn't
condemn
him
of
--
just
because
he
knew
those
words
and
maybe
felt
in
this
context
in
writing
the
statement
that
he
could
use
them.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
the
police
put
these
words
in
his
mouth.
the
fact
that
this
particular
one-half
inch
penetration
is
something
that
the
police
conjured
up
in
his
mind
is
just
simply
not
supportable
by
the
record.
you
read
the
psychiatric
report
and
that
is
in
the
record
and
he
said
he
was
upset
when
he
found
out
that
she
had
not
had
sexual
relations
before.
well,
she
told
him
that.
the
only
way
he
found
out
was
because,
obviously
from
the
record,
as
he
said,
he
was
only
able
to
make
penetration,
only
a
slight
way,
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
the
woman's
hymen
had
not
been
ruptured.
this
is
a
clear,
factual
as
to
--
that
he
knew
why
he
made
that
statement
and
why
it
was
accurate,
not
a
fabrication
of
the
police
officers.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
have
any
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
no,
i
don't
believe
i
would've
put
in
a
strong
statement
concerning
his
right
to
remain
silent
had
not
we
agreed
to
stipulate
to
this
other
portion
of
the
other
record.
but
i
believe
that
as
long
as
that's
in
the
record,
i
can
make
this
statement
because
it's
supported
in
the
finding
of
the
court
based
on
the
interrogation
of
the
officers,
the
testimony
of
the
officers
in
the
trial
that
is
actually
before
this
court
concerning
their
advise
to
him,
and
the
findings
of
the
court
based
on
his
understanding,
the
reading
of
the
statement,
the
testimony
coupled
with
this.
i
believe,
then,
that
the
court
below,
which
clearly
found
that
to
be
true,
that
he
had
been
fully
advised,
had
a
proper
basis
for
finding
all
of
these
to
exist
except
that
there
is
no
quarrel
that
he
was
not
specifically
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
believe
the
police
officers
testified
to
the
fact
that
they
told
him
of
his
rights
and
that
they
also,
besides
telling
him
that
perhaps
--
the
record
is
a
little
unclear,
in
both
cases,
as
to
exactly
when
it
took
place
but
i
believe
the
record
supports
a
statement
that
he
was
advised
specifically
by
them
of
his
rights
and
then
he
was
adverted
to
the
paragraph
and
perhaps
even
again
the
paragraph
was
read
to
him.
but
it
--
the
record
is
not
really
all
four-square.
it
is
not
that
clear.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
well
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
assuming
for
a
moment
that
some
warning
is
going
to
be
required
or
should
have
been
given
or
isn't,
then
i
would
think,
to
be
of
any
effect
it
must
be
given
before
he'd
made
any
statement.
perhaps
he
might've
refused
to
sign
a
written
confession.
certainly
still,
the
oral
statements
could
have
been
introduced
against
him
there.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
at
some
meaningful
time,
right.
i
would
think
it
have
to
be
at
some
time
prior
to
the
fact
that
after
--
if
they
used
it
before,
of
course
the
warning
would
mean
nothing.
if
they
could
introduce
what
they
had
obtained
probably
before
they
gave
the
warning
and
what
afterwards
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
no.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
no.
my
position
basically
is
--
concerning
the
warning,
is
that
each
case
presents
a
factual
situation
in
which
the
court
would
have
to
determine
or
a
court
or
a
judge
or
prosecutor
at
some
level
would
have
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
a
defendant
because
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
his
confession
was
denied
a
specific
right,
whether
it
be
right
to
counsel,
the
right
to
not
be
compelled
to
testify
against
himself.
and
that
the
warning,
or
an
age
or
literacy,
the
circumstances,
length
of
the
questioning,
all
these
factors
would
be
important.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
pin
it
to
one
simple
thing
as
a
warning
because
of
--
there
are
perhaps
many
situations
we
could
think
of
where
a
warning
would
be
completely
inadequate.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
his
age,
his
experience,
his
background,
the
type
of
questioning,
the
atmosphere
of
questioning,
the
length
of
questioning,
time
of
--
the
time
of
day,
perhaps,
all
of
these
factors.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
well,
i
think
that's
what
the
escobedo
case
indicates.
in
other
words,
i'm
--
of
course
my
opinion
is
biased
in
a
--
i
am
--
if
it
is
not
something
like
that,
then
it's
an
absolute
right
to
counsel.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
in-between
unless
some
other
theory.
under
the
way
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
its
--
if
it
is
an
absolute
right
to
counsel,
the
same
sort
of
right
to
counsel
that
attaches
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
would
think
so,
certainly.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
would
say,
not
absolutely.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
i'm
not
a
psychiatrist,
so
i
can't
say.
i
don't
--
i
think
both
reports
say
in
the
effect
that
the
man
has
an
emotional
illness
that
should
be
treated,
that
he
knew
what
was
going
on,
both
the
reports
say
his
mental
faculties,
whatever
they
were,
were
sharp,
acute,
he
had
no
psychotic
disorders.
i
think,
they're
both
--
they
both
say
basically
the
same
thing.
i
think
the
diagnosis
in
the
other
report
was
a
“sociopathic
personality.”
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
oh,
it's
arguable.
i
have
extensively
argued
the
facts
that
he
wasn't
of
such
a
nature,
as
an
individual
because
of
his
mental
condition
or
his
educational
background,
as
to
require
any
more
than
he
got.
he
got
every
--
in
other
words,
i'm
saying
that
he
got
every
warning
except
the
right
--
the
warning,
the
specific
warning
of
the
right
to
counsel.
he
didn't
have
counsel.
counsel
wasn't
specifically
denied
to
him,
on
the
basis
of
a
request
to
retain
counsel.
the
only
possible
thing
that
happened
to
mr.
miranda
that
--
in
my
light,
assuming
that
he
had
the
capability
of
understanding
at
all,
is
the
fact
that
he
did
not
get
the
specific
warning
of
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes.
i
think
the
police
officers
--
they
were
never
pinned
down
as
to
when
--
in
other
words,
whether
at
11:30
when
they
went
into
interrogation
room
2,
they
immediately
warned
him.
this
was
never
pinned
down
by
either
side.
but
they
did
say
that
he
was
warned.
and
then
they
went
to
elaborate
that
he
was
warned
specifically,
as
i
believe,
as
my
recollection
serves
me
correctly,
in
(inaudible)
--
in
response
to
a
specific
question
concerning
the
statement,
they
said
he
was
--
the
part
of
the
statement
was
read
to
him
again.
now,
i
believe
that
the
court
could
find
from
the
record
that
he
was
warned
at
11:30.
if
the
warning
is
required
in
this
particular
case
to
protect
his
rights
and
its
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
which
the
court
below
did
not
find,
that
it
was
not
given
until
the
written
statement,
and
i
would
suppose
that
it
wasn't
given
at
the
proper
time.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
not
completely.
i
don't
think
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
worded
its
holdings,
and
i
cite
the
course
--
court,
the
case
that
followed
miranda
and
referred
back
to
it
concerning
the
point
to
waiver
and
they
go
on
to
expand
on
their
thinking.
i
don't
believe
the
arizona
court
has
specifically
said
that
warnings
as
such
are
of
a
constitutional
dimension.
the
court
has
said
that
in
some
cases
warnings
may
be
required
in
a
given
case.
and
in
fact,
in
the
goff
case,
which
i
cite
as
the
next
case
in
the
arizona
court's
determination,
they
say
it's
important
that
the
--
that
all
steps
be
taken
at
the
earliest
possible
time
when
they
are
indicated
by
the
fact
situation
to
ensure
that
the
state
doesn't
overreach
and
that
the
man
is
given
every
benefit
of
his
rights
under
the
constitution.
but
i
don't
believe
they
have
yet
said
as
a
constitutional
dimension
any
specific
warning
at
any
specific
situation
needs
be
given.
its
my
argument
concerning
the
factors
surrounding
escobedo
that
if
escobedo
is
a
completely
distinct
and
separate
determination
of
a
sixth
amendment
right,
as
divorced
from
the
fifth
amendment
right,
which
i
think
is
pretty
hard
to
do,
then
in
order
for
it
to
be
meaningful
and
effective,
not
just
to
the
defendants
but
to
the
people
of
the
state,
of
the
country,
it's
got
to
announce
a
rule
which
forbids
affirmative
conduct
on
the
basis
of
police
officers
or
prosecutors
calculated
in
a
given
situation
to
deny
the
man
the
implementation
of
his
right,
whether
it
be
the
right
to
counsel
or
the
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
right
not
to
incriminate
himself,
the
right
is
for
him
not
to
be
compelled,
whether
it's
subtle
compulsion
or
direct,
but
it
is
still
a
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself.
at
least
this
is
my
understanding
and
he
doesn't
have
a
right
not
to
self
--
not
to
incriminate
himself.
he
has
a
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
by
some
means,
either
direct
or
devious.
now,
i
think
if
the
extreme
position
is
adopted
that
says
he
has
to
either
have
counsel
at
this
stage,
or
intelligently
waive
counsel,
that
a
serious
problem
in
the
enforcement
of
our
criminal
law
will
occur.
first
of
all,
let
us
make
one
thing
certain.
we
need
no
empirical
data
as
to
one
factor,
what
counsel
will
do
if
he
is
actually
introduced.
i
am
talking
now
about
counsel
for
defendant.
there
--
at
least
among
lawyers,
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
what
counsel
for
the
defendant
is
to
do.
he
is
to
represent
him
100%,
win,
lose,
or
draw,
guilty
or
innocent.
that's
our
system.
now,
when
counsel
is
introduced
at
interrogation,
interrogation
ceases
immediately.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
well,
for
one
reason
--
first
of
all,
let's
assume
and
on
--
and
there
are
several
different
situations,
but
assuming
counsel
is
immediately
introduced
and
he
knows
nothing
about
the
case.
he
has
not
talked
to
his
defendant
that
he's
appointed,
let's
say.
he
was
appointed
to
an
indigent,
an
indigent
defendant
who
says,
“i
want
a
lawyer.
i
need
a
lawyer
right
now.
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you
without
a
lawyer.”
he's
given
a
lawyer.
he
talks
to
the
defendant.
now,
first
of
all
he
stops
the
interrogation
telling
--
talk
to
them.
i
would
think
he
--
if
he
is
going
to
represent
him,
he
cannot
allow
him
to
say
anything
until
he
finds
out
what
his
story
is,
what
he
is
going
to
stay
--
is
going
to
--
how
it
is
going
to
affect
him.
so
the
interrogation
immediately
would
stop
for
that
purpose.
and
after
he
has
had
an
opportunity
to
confer
with
his
client,
let's
assume
another
thing.
let's
just
assume
his
client
said,
“yes,
i
did
it.
i
am
guilty.”
had
all
the
requisite
intents,
he
makes
a
statement
to
his
lawyer
in
confidence
that
he
did
it,
and
asks
his
lawyer
what
(inaudible)
--
what
he
should
do.
well,
the
lawyer
maybe
doesn't
know
his
past
history.
maybe
the
lawyer
would
want
to
find
out
what
the
police
have,
if
he
can.
and
so
maybe
more
time
would
--
in
order
to
properly
represent
him,
would
be
taken
up
here,
time
which
there
would
be
no
interrogation.
but
let's
further
assume
that
he
advised
his
client,
“well,
i
think
you
ought
to
confess.
i
think
there's
a
possibility
for
a
light
sentence.
you
did
it.
they
have
other
evidence
or
maybe
they
don't
have
any
other
evidence.
let's
say
they
don't
have
any
other
evidence
and
you
can
confess.”
and
the
fellow
says,
“well,
i
don't
want
to
confess.
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
gas
chamber
if
i
don't
have
to.
is
it
--
is
there
anything
else
that
you,
as
my
lawyer,
can
do
for
me?”
well,
what
has
he
got
to
tell
him?
that
i
--
under
our
system,
he's
got
to
tell
him,
“yes,
you
don't
have
to
say
anything.
there's
been
--
and
the
fact
that
you
don't
say
anything
can't
in
any
way
hurt
you,
be
inferred
otherwise,
and
we
can
put
the
state
to
its
burden
of
proof.”
and
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
well,
as
i
understand
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes,
i'm
sure,
i
--
it's
my
understanding
that
he
is.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
because
we
believe
that
it's
right
and
proper
that
the
criminal
defendant
not
be
deprived
of
his
life,
liberty,
or
property,
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
right.
this
is
--
but
i
mean
in
--
this
is
just
one
issue
wherein
the
lawyer
has
to
guard
all
these
rights.
but
i'm
saying
the
practical
effect
of
introducing
counsel
at
the
interrogation
stage
is
going
to
stop
the
interrogation
for
any
and
all
purposes,
except
what
counsel
decides
will
be
in
the
best
interest
of
his
defendant.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
otherwise,
counsel
will
not
be
doing
his
job.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
well,
certainly
that's
the
object
of
what
his
lawyer
is
telling
him.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
it
--
well,
that
is
the
question,
whether
it's
--
of
course
his
--
the
fifth
amendment,
he
has
the
right
never
to
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
at
whatever
stage.
and
this
is
of
course,
involving
a
knowledgeable
implementation
of
that
right
at
this
time,
if
he
wants
to.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
state
does
not
have
to
at
this
stage,
insist
on
that
right
being
enforced
or
waived
because
even
--
it'd
be
--
pre-trial
police
interrogation
does
more
than
just
develop
confessions
or
incriminate
--
it
in
--
it
develops
incriminating
statements.
it
develops
exculpatory
statements
which
pin
a
story
down
to
a
defendant
very
closely
after
the
crime
has
been
committed
or
very
closely
as
after
he's
been
taken
in
police
custody
which
prevent
--
or
effectively
make
it
unprofitable
for
him
to
perjure
himself
or
change
his
testimony
at
the
trial
should
he
take
the
stand.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
of
course
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
to
me,
i
think
there
is.
i
think
there
is
a
valid
interest
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
right.
but
i
think
that
--
well,
and
this
is
another
argument
that
i
think
must
be
made.
our
adversary
system
as
such
is
not
completely
adversary
even
at
the
trial
stage
in
a
criminal
prosecution
because
canon
five
of
the
canons
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association
which
are
law
in
arizona
by
rule
of
court
says
that
the
duty
of
the
prosecution
is
not
simply
to
go
out
and
convict
but
is
to
see
that
justice
is
done.
i
know,
i've
talked
to
many
prosecutors
myself
in
my
short
time,
i've
gotten
as
much
satisfaction
out
of
the
cases
when
i
--
which
i
was
compelled
to
confess
error
in
a
case
where
a
man
has
been
deprived
of
his
rights
by
due
process
that
i've
gotten
satisfaction
in
being
upheld
in
a
tight
case
in
a
court.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
mr.
flynn
would
tell
you
more
about
that
at
the
trial
level.
i
don't
believe
that
the
rule
has
been
interpreted
very
broadly.
i
think
it
has
been
interpreted
narrowly.
i
think
he
can
get
his
own
statements
and
perhaps
he
can
get
the
police
officers'
reports.
there
is
a
rule
providing
for
motions,
but
the
judges,
as
i
understand
it,
have
construed
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
--
fairly
narrowly.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes.
of
course
i
--
i'm
sure
the
prosecutors
would
go
a
100%
go
along
with
the
full
discovery
for
both
sides
but
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
with
full
--
with
full
discovery
for
both
sides
but
this
is
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
but,
this
would
do
(inaudible)
--
the
defendant
of
course
is
compelled
to
no
discovery,
no
ordinary
discovery
procedures
in
the
scope
we
think
of
them
in
a
civil
case.
so,
i
just
say
this,
that
they
are
--
i'm
not
sure
the
analogy
is
completely
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
yes.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
surely,
it
does.
but
there
is
no
compulsion.
in
fact,
the
compulsion
is
to
the
contrary
on
the
defense
side
to
cooperate,
whereas
the
--
there
is
complete
compulsion
at
least
by
my
interpretation
of
the
law
for
the
prosecutor
to
do
as
much,
if
it's
available
to
him,
to
show
that
the
defendant's
innocent
or
prove
he's
guilty.
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
it
doesn't
always
work
that
--
mr.
gary
k.
nelson
it
doesn't
always
work
that
way.
i'm
sure
that's
the
case.
but
this
--
here
again
is
another
point
that
i
emphasize,
this
is
no
reason,
i
don't
think
for
a
constitutional
rule
which
would
in
effect
take
care
of
what
i
consider
to
be
the
exceptions
to
the
rule
rather
than
the
general
practice.
i
might
just
say,
since
i
notice
that
my
time
is
about
up,
counsel
made
a
statement
to
the
effect,
in
answer
to
a
question
of
one
of
the
justice
--
i
forget
which
one,
something
about
that
--
why
miranda
talked
that,
“maybe
he
was
raised
to
tell
the
truth
through
our
society,
you
are
raised
to
tell
the
truth
and
respect
authority.”
this
brings
another
thing
into
play,
i
believe,
which
is
vitally
important,
and
the
prosecutors
in
my
state
consider
it
so.
that
if
in
fact,
you
either
have
counsel
or
you
don't,
and
it
thereby
seriously
circumscribes
interrogation
and
confession,
you
eliminate
an
early
part
of
one
of
the
most
important
principles,
hopefully,
in
our
criminal
law.
and
that
is
not
just
to
convict,
not
just
to
deter,
not
just
to
put
somebody
away,
but
to
rehabilitate
and
at
the
earliest
possible
moment.
and
i
don't
have
that
many
personal
experiences,
so
(inaudible)
--
we
had
a
meeting
with
the
prosecutors
in
our
state
and
many
of
the
cases
involving
confessions
in
pre-trial
interrogation
where
the
cases
were
--
whether
a
man
has
at
least
admitted
he
has
done
something
wrong
or
cases
where
the
defendants
were
much
more
susceptible
to
rehabilitation
at
this
stage.
if
you
foreclose
this,
then
you
develop
an
attitude
in
the
police
officers,
you
take
the
personal
attitude
away.
many
a
hardened
police
officer,
who
needs
--
developed
a
case
of
tremendous
circumstantial
evidence
against
a
man,
and
yet
the
man
sits
there
and
keeps
telling
him
“i
didn't
do
it,”
he
is
going
to
wonder.
there's
a
personal
factor
there.
he
is
going
to
wonder,
“why
doesn't
this
man
confess?
why
doesn't
he
say
something
about
doing
it?”
even
assuming
now
arguendo
that
it's
not
coercion
that
we've
--
i
have
no
argument
that
whatever
is
considered
coercion,
whether
it's
subtle
or
otherwise,
should
not
be
used.
but
assuming
the
interrogation
is
good,
except
for
that,
he
is
going
to
wonder,
and
maybe
he
is
going
to
go
out
and
examine
that
eyewitness
who
saw
him
at
2
o'clock
in
the
morning
under
a
dark
street
light
and
examine
this
other
evidence
because
he
wonders
that
personal
element,
he
ought
to
confess.
here
is
all
the
evidence.
it's
a
prima
facie
case.
this
is
wiped
out
completely
if
you
terribly
circumscribed
this
particular
pre-trial
invest
--
this
(inaudible)
--
personal
element
is
out,
and
he
can
say,
“well,
i
got
the
evidence.
maybe
he's
guilty,
maybe
he's
not.
i
didn't
talk
to
him.
i
don't
know
how
he
acts
or
to
be
--
how
he
turns
up.”
and
i
think
its
defendants
could
be
heard
as
much
as
the
--
as
the
prosecution.
