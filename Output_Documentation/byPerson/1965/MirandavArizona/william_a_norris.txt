mr.
william
a.
norris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
may
--
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
follow
up
on
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
because
as
an
advocate
of
course,
i
was
looking
for
some
independent
state
ground
upon
which
to
base
a
claim
that
it's'
written
as
granted
improvidently.
there
was
another
ground
as
you
know
which
i
did
find
and
argued
but
that
is
now
behind
us.
i
was
satisfied
mr.
justice
fortas
that
there
was
no
independent
state
ground.
that
the
california
supreme
court
did
feel
compelled
to
reach
the
results
it
reached
in
this
case
because
of
escobedo.
whether
or
not
the
california
supreme
court
would
have
reached
the
result
anyway
in
the
absence
of
escobedo
is
of
course
another
question.
i
think
and
i
will
argue
this,
i
hope
i
would
find
time
to
argue
this,
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
taken
the
correct
approach
in
interpreting
and
applying
escobedo.
the
california
supreme
court
in
effect
said
there
are
three
questions.
one
is
the
“accusatory
stage”
reached
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation.
two,
is
the
right
to
counsel
which
attaches
at
that
point
dependent
upon
a
request?
the
answer,
no
of
citing
carmony
and
crawford
(ph).
thirdly,
was
there
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel?
and
the
california
supreme
court
again
correctly
i
believe,
looked
to
such
questions
as
warning
as
the
age
and
experience
of
the
accused
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
waiver.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
california
supreme
court
was
relying
squarely
on
escobedo.
mr.
william
a.
norris
that
as
i
read
the
california
supreme
court's
opinion,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
a.
norris
that's
my
reading
case,
yes
sir.
and
it
is
my
position
here
that
on
the
facts,
the
stewart
case
raises
a
very
narrow
question
and
that
is
whether
the
requested
itself
was
an
essential
ingredient
in
the
escobedo
case.
i
believe
of
course
that
constitutional
rights
cannot
possibly
turn
on
such
a
tenuous
ground.
i
was
interested
that
the
deputy
attorney
general
conceded
that
if
stewart
had
requested
counsel,
presumably
the
state
would
have
had
to
furnish
him
counsel
whether
he
knew
a
lawyer
or
not,
whether
he
could
afford
a
lawyer.
now
once
you
reach
that
point,
i
think
we
can't
penalized
of
course
the
accused
who
may
not
even
know
enough
to
ask
for
a
lawyer.
this
case
is
indistinguishable
as
i
say
on
all
of
its
facts
except
for
the
absence
of
a
request.
so
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
it
seems
to
me,
this
court
must
either
overrule
escobedo
or
distinguish
escobedo
on
such
a
tenuous
ground
that
for
all
practical
purposes
i
believe
it
would
be
overruled.
the
state
makes
an
argument
that
in
denying
a
request,
the
state
took
an
affirmative
act
and
placed
itself
between
the
accused
and
his
lawyer.
well
if
it's
an
affirmative
act
that
we're
looking
for
and
i
don't
really
think
when
it's
necessary,
we
have
it
when
the
police
prolonged
the
detention
for
five
days
before
taking
stewart
before
a
magistrate.
that
is
an
affirmative
act
keeping
stewart
from
his
lawyer
because
once
he
gets
into
the
formal
judicial
process
he's
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
i
would
like
to
review
the
facts
of
the
detention
just
briefly.
he
was
arrested
along
with
his
wife
and
three
other
persons
who
just
happened
to
be
at
his
house
on
the
evening
of
january
31st.
mr.
william
a.
norris
the
house
was
full
of
stolen
goods,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
a.
norris
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
whether
or
not
the
arrest
of
all
five
of
them
was
based
on
probable
cause,
i
don't
know.
i
can
see
that
the
arrest
of
stewart
was
based
on
probable
cause.
mr.
william
a.
norris
in
his
case
and
the
record
is
silent
on
the
reasons
to
why
they
arrested
the
other
four.
maybe
it
was
because
of
the
stolen
goods.
mr.
william
a.
norris
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
william
a.
norris
if
i
understand
the
question
your
honor,
if
it
is
whether
we
adopted
the
prima
facie
test,
we
would
have
reached
the
accusatory
stage
in
this
case
as
well
as
in
escobedo.
i
would
say
clearly
yes
without
regard
to
the
request
because
here,
i
believe
the
police
had
much
more
evidence
against
him
than
a
--
at
the
time
--
by
the
time
of
the
confession
service
and
even
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
than
against
escobedo.
they
had
a
personal
identification
of
him
as
the
one
who
negotiated
the
checks.
they
found
the
stolen
property.
after
they
took
him
into
custody
and
questioned
him,
they
got
the
opinion
of
a
handwriting
expert
that
he
did
indeed
signed
those
checks.
they
finally
got
some
admissions
from
him
that
he
had
possession
of
some
of
these
articles
although
he
always
denied
his
involvement
in
any
of
the
crimes.
and
finally
upon
the
morning
of
tuesday
the
fifth,
the
fifth
day
of
detention,
the
sergeant
testified
that
he
opened
up
the
interrogation
by
saying,
“roy,
you
killed
that
old
woman
and
you
aren't
even
sorry.”
now
if
that
isn't
enough
for
focus
in
the
accusatory
stage,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
mr.
william
a.
norris
without
question.
mr.
william
a.
norris
yes
and
i
do
think,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
--
i
think
the
court
in
escobedo
made
them
what
--
made
what
i
considered
to
be
a
good
effort
to
try
to
answer
what
i
consider
to
be
the
hard
question
in
these
cases.
it's
the
question
that
i
--
that
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
the
other
day
saying
at
what
point
in
period
to
trial
do
sixth
amendment
rights
accrue
and
i
think
this
court
in
escobedo
did
a
good
job
in
trying
to
come
up
with
some
guidelines
as
to
when
that
point
is
reached.
i
think
the
california
supreme
court
is
doing
an
excellent
job
in
interpreting
and
applying
escobedo,
giving
some
more
flesh
to
the
guidelines
that
brought
here.
mr.
william
a.
norris
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
i
would
not
argue
that
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
that
is
not
required
by
escobedo.
mr.
william
a.
norris
and
i
think
that's
a
false
argument.
mr.
william
a.
norris
mr.
justice
black,
i
agree
with
you
but
i
also
must
part
company
because
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
analyze
these
cases
in
terms
of
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
william
a.
norris
because
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
for
a
number
of
purposes,
mr.
justice
black,
i
can't
conceive
of
a
situation
for
example
in
which
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
finding
that
the
compulsion
itself
caused
the
man
to
answer
the
police
officer's
question.
i
can
imagine
a
case
for
example
where
you
have
a
reasonably
intelligent
layman
who
maybe
advised
a
gideon
if
you
will
who
may
be
advised
by
the
police
that
your
--
we're
going
to
have
to
hold
you
until
tomorrow
morning
when
we'll
take
you
before
judicial
officer.
you
don't
have
any
obligation
to
talk
to
them.
so
you're
not
going
to
be
held
here
very
long
just
until
we
get
you
before
a
magistrate.
now
we'd
like
to
talk
to
you.
you
don't
have
to
understand,
but
we
have
a
few
questions
and
feel
free
to
answer
them.
now
what
--
the
only
thing
he
doesn't
know
is
that
he
--
is
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
william
a.
norris
he
does
know
that,
that's
right.
the
compulsion
is
that
he
can't
get
away
but
i
think
that
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
find
compulsion
that
he
--
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
william
a.
norris
yeah.
well
i
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
mr.
justice
black
i
think
we
end
up
with
the
same
point
because
i
think
my
position
is
that
the
only
effective
way
to
protect
the
right
to
remain
silent,
the
right
not
to
testify
against
yourself
is
to
make
sure
that
he
has
a
lawyer.
it
is
counsel
that
is
the
vehicle
for
protection
of
all
of
the
other
rights.
i
was
interested
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
argued
this
primarily
as
a
fifth
amendment
case
on
the
ground
that
there
maybe
some
other
ways
of
protecting
their
right
to
remain
silent,
but
when
it
was
all
said
and
done,
they
agreed
that
the
only
one
they
could
really
think
of
was
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
william
a.
norris
but
mr.
justice
stewart
i
could
argue
that
i
think
the
other
way.
that
those
facts
shown
that
danny
escobedo
waived
his
right
to
counsel
and
waived
his
right
to
silence,
that
his
knowledge
would
under
johnson
against
zerbst
could
be
argued
that
way.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well,
that
maybe
and
it
maybe
a
totality
of
circumstances
case,
but
i
question
whether
this
court
would
reach
a
different
result
just
because
danny
escobedo
either
didn't
have
a
lawyer
or
didn't
know
of
his
right
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
william
a.
norris
i
suppose
mr.
justice
stewart
it
could
be
read
that
way
but
i
prefer
to
read
it
the
way
the
california
supreme
court
had.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
i
would
urge
this
court
not
to
adopt
the
totality
of
circumstances
rule.
mr.
william
a.
norris
if
i
may
answer
that
first
by
saying
that
even
though
as
an
advocate
i
could
go
down
each
of
the
circumstances
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
and
argue
that
on
each
one
of
them.
in
my
case
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
–
it
argues
for
over
reaching
as
a
conclusion
clearly.
the
view
that
i
would
--
that
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
is
that
the
hard
question
again
and
the
question
i
think
we
should
grapple
with
is
when
a
criminal
prosecution
begins
under
the
sixth
amendment
because
it's
simply
advent
of
that
process
that
the
right
to
counsel
comes
into
play.
now
that's
a
hard
question.
i
don't
think
it's
a
totality
of
circumstances
question.
mr.
william
a.
norris
that
maybe
mr.
justice
black
but
the
fifth
amendment
also
talks
in
terms
of
criminal
cases.
so
maybe
you
have
the
same
problem
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
determining
for
all
practical
purposes
when
does
a
person
stand
accused
of
a
crime
by
the
forces
of
the
state.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
does
talk
in
terms
of
in
a
criminal
case.
now
maybe
it
is
arguable
of
that
unless
you
have
reached
this
point
in
the
proceedings
if
you
don't
have
a
criminal
case
and
the
fifth
amendment
cannot
apply.
mr.
william
a.
norris
that's
right.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
i
don't
think
this
court
can
escape
that
problem,
mr.
justice
fortas.
at
some
point,
this
court
must
decide
what
marks
the
beginning
of
a
criminal
prosecution
in
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
because
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
and
i
would
prefer
mr.
justice
black
to
avoid
the
question
as
to
whether
during
secret
police
interrogation,
it
happened
to
be
voluntary
or
not
voluntary
because
i
can
conceive
of
some
circumstances
in
which
it
might
be
involuntary
or
voluntary.
and
if
it
is,
then
i
see
no
more
reason
to
exclude
--
to
admit
the
confession
than
--
than
in
the
case
of
arraignment
where
he's
asked
to
plead.
the
difficulty
i
have
is
distinguishing
white
against
maryland
and
escobedo.
those
who
argue
against
escobedo
without
regard
to
the
question
of
compulsion,
let's
assume
it's
totally
voluntary
which
i
think
is
not
the
case
here,
but
let's
assume
that
it
is.
you
mean
to
tell
me
we're
going
to
let
the
police
effectively
charge
the
man
with
crime
one
night
and
then
interrogate
him
in
the
absence
of
a
lawyer,
and
let
him
confess
his
guilt,
and
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
he
should
talk,
make
a
judgment
for
example
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
not
committing
himself
to
taking
the
stand
at
trial
as
in
the
carnley
with
the
consequence
results
or
--
but
in
the
next
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
that's
a
hard
question.
mr.
william
a.
norris
yes,
it's
a
hard
question
for
all
aside
from
any
waiver
but
what
right
does
he
have
to
waive?
can
he
right
his
--
waive
his
right
to
remain
silent
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
mr.
william
a.
norris
that's
right,
but
i
don't
--
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
a.
norris
what
mr.
justice
black
he
may
waive
that
intelligently.
mr.
william
a.
norris
that's
what
i'm
concerned
about,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
a.
norris
provided
he
had
the
advice.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well,
i'd
like
to
say
my
view
is
that
--
that's
the
case
of
indistinguishable
from
white.
if
we
won't
let
him
answer
the
judge's
question
as
to
whether
he's
guilty
or
not
guilty
without
legal
counsel
we
shouldn't
let
him
confess
the
night
before
to
police
officers
who
have
him
in
detention.
that's
even
more.
he
had
a
greater
need
i
should
think
for
a
counsel
at
that
point,
perhaps
even
of
that
arraignment.
mr.
william
a.
norris
mr.
justice
clark,
i
really
don't
think
that
follows
from
my
position.
i'd
like
to
discuss
for
a
moment
the
consequences
of
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
but
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
choice
for
the
police
to
make.
in
my
view,
escobedo
does
not
require
the
state
to
provide
lawyers
in
the
police
station.
what
happens
after
he's
arrested
and
after
this
process
of
interrogation
began
is
determined
by
the
state.
if
the
state
wants
to
engage
in
that
process,
then
he's
accused
of
a
crime,
he's
all
practical
purposes
these
of
the
defendant
and
he
must
be
furnished
with
counsel
but
if
it
--
what
the
state
must
forgo
and
the
practice
that
the
escobedo
rule
will
end
is
the
very
practice
that
i
think
this
court
should
end
and
that
is
secret
interrogation
of
a
person
accused
of
a
crime
by
the
police
and
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
mr.
william
a.
norris
not
as
that
evanescent,
mr.
justice
stewart
as
totality
of
the
circumstances
where
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
education
of
the
accused,
the
qualities
of
the
accused,
his
knowledge,
his
experience,
and
all
the
rest.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
that
is
--
that
is
true
but
i
think
of
that
is
a
more
meaningful
guideline
than
the
test
to
voluntariness
or
involuntariness
and
i
think
that
that
it
will
be
a
more
meaningful
guideline
to
the
police.
the
practical
effect
of
such
view
as
i
say
will
be
to
discourage
secret
police
interrogation.
and
i
believe
the
core
of
the
problem
is
the
incompatibility
of
the
process
of
detaining
an
accused
purpose
--
person
for
the
purpose
of
secret
interrogations.
i
think
that
process
is
totally
incompatible
with
the
safeguard
of
our
accusatorial
adversary
system.
and
if
you
permit
the
police
to
engage
in
this
process,
it's
so
easy
to
circumvent
all
of
those
safeguards.
it
becomes
a
mockery
why
the
police
--
the
representatives
of
the
states
here
have
argued
in
effect,
we
must
have
the
right
to
interrogate
while
if
we
don't
interrogate
them
there,
we
certainly
can't
interrogate
them
in
the
court
room
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
well
i
should
say
not
and
they
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
so
easily
circumvent
the
safeguards.
mr.
william
a.
norris
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
maybe
the
simplest
rule
but
i
do
believe
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
i
believe
that
the
california
supreme
court
is
trying
to
go
down
a
sensible
path
somewhere
between
those
two
positions,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
perhaps
that's
the
route
we
should
take
for
the
moment
because
the
california
supreme
court
is
making
a
case
by
case
determination.
and
in
some
circumstances
where
there
is
a
spontaneous
confession
to
the
police
where
there's
a
--
an
effort
to
--
to
explain
some
circumstances,
california
supreme
court
is
just
saying
fine
that
those
confessions
or
admissions
are
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
that's
correct.
i
think
that
is
not
a
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
a.
norris
that
is
my
position.
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
william
a.
norris
i
wouldn't
qualify
my
response
along
that
line.
i
think
the
police
must
engage
in
this
process
of
interrogation.
i
think
the
police
must
engage
that
they
did
in
this
case
in
a
little
adversary
proceeding
where
they're
trying
to
extract
from
him
a
confession.
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
to
protect
an
accused
against
compulsion
from
him
--
within
himself.
if
he
is
walking
back
to
his
cell
with
the
guard,
he
might
say
something
that
would
just
volunteer
something.
so
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
yes.
i
would
want
to
know
more
facts
in
--
in
the
cutter
case
i
believe
it
was
decided
by
the
california
supreme
court.
the
fellow
called
up
and
said,
“gee,
i
just
tried
to
kill
someone
and
i'm
going
to
be
on
a
given
corner,
come
and
get
me.”
and
they
arrived
and
said,
“here's
the
knife
i've
used.”
mr.
william
a.
norris
i'm
going
to
get
into
the
police
car.
he
was
in
the
police
car
and
they
said,
“what
really
happened
back
there?”
and
he
said
--
he
told
them
that
he
made
a
detailed
statement
and
then
they
interrogated
him
again
at
the
police
station
more
formal
interrogation,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
a
confession
in
the
police
car
was
admissible
because
the
police
hadn't
yet
engaged
in
the
adversary
process.
i
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
i
think
i
--
i
think
that's
a
--
that's
a
meaningful
line,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
norris
just
volunteered
the
statements,
i
think
they're
admissible
just
as
they
would
be
admissible
if
he
volunteered
him
to
the
guard
after
he
left
the
courtroom
indeed
and
didn't
have
his
lawyer
with
him.
mr.
william
a.
norris
it's
a
hardline
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
william
a.
norris
we
were
focusing
on
what
i
call
the
hard
question
and
that
i
think
is
the
hard
case.
mr.
william
a.
norris
and
you
have
the
hard
question
or
it'd
be
very
easy
to
draw
the
line
at
trial
but
powell
said
no.
sometime
in
advance
of
trial
and
indeed
white
and
hamilton
said
that
it
would
be
as
early
as
arraignment
and
messiah
held
that
it
didn't
even
have
to
be
part
of
the
formal
judicial
proceeding,
that
the
adversary
system
was
operating
and
i
think
that
you
can't
draw
the
line
so
formally
and
that's
hard.
mr.
william
a.
norris
yes
sir,
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
norris
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
it
would
be
easier
to
–
simpler
to
draw
the
line
at
one
of
these
cut-off
points
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
meaningfully
because
you
would
so
easily
permit
the
police
to
circumvent
all
of
the
safeguards
of
our
society.
mr.
william
a.
norris
in
the
sense
that
the
line
will
be
hard
to
drop
but
it
doesn't
get
into
all
of
the
factors
and
the
tough
factors
that
turn
on
the
particular
individual.
that's
what
the
police
are
doing
and
what
--
what
the
process
that
they're
engaged
in
which
becomes
the
important
process.
yes.
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
a.
norris
i'm
sorry.
well
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
i
think
the
only
practical
effect
of
the
rule
that
i
think
is
the
escobedo
rule
would
be
to
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
yes.
the
only
practical
consequence
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
clark,
would
be
to
put
an
end
to
the
practice
of
interrogating
persons
accused
of
crime
in
a
police
station
in
secret
without
the
advice
of
counsel
and
i
think
that
practice
should
be
discouraged.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well,
i
think
the
avenue
open
to
the
police
is
not
to
interrogate
him
but
to
take
him
before
a
magistrate
at
the
earliest
possible
time.
i
believe
it
is
incompatible
with
our
system
to
give
the
police
the
power
to
take
a
man
and
hold
him
in
secret
and
interrogate
him.
mr.
william
a.
norris
that
would
come
to
a
question
of
waiver
mr.
justice
clark.
i
think
for
a
one
man,
a
warning
might
be
effective.
for
another
man,
an
experience
criminal
lawyer,
a
warning
might
be
unnecessary.
still
for
another
man
who
really
isn't
incapable
of
making
a
judgment
even
with
the
warning,
a
warning
may
not
be
enough.
i
think
that's
a
factor
to
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
he
has
made
the
knowledgeable
and
intelligent
waiver
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
in
my
view,
that
would
not
be
enough.
that
would
not
be
enough.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
because
i
--
my
experience
with
this
is
in
the
district
court
and
i
have
watched
judge
hall
for
example
interrogate
indigents
about
their
rights
and
it's
very
tough
to
waive
your
right
to
counsel
before
judge
hall
and
i
think
it
should
be.
i
think
that
you
have
to
have
evidence
of
a
--
that
that
man
knew
what
he
was
doing.
you
can't
force
upon
him
a
right
to
counsel.
you
can't
force
upon
him
any
of
his
constitutional
rights,
but
that's
a
--
that's
a
--
that
is
a
hard
question
and
that
is
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
question
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
william
a.
norris
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
then
i
think,
you
may
have
--
you
have
essentially
the
same
question.
it's
a
question
of
waiver
and
it
may
not
be
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
that's
why
i
would
prefer
to
keep
away
from
the
fifth
amendment
because
i
think
it
ought
to
be
as
under
white
against
maryland.
it
just
ought
to
be
whether
he
had
the
protection
of
counsel
in
making
the
judgment
about
whether
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
no,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
would
simply
require
the
police
to
take
him
before
--
take
him
before
a
magistrate
forthwith.
mr.
william
a.
norris
without
question,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
that's
--
that's
a
judgment
for
the
--
for
the
individual
to
make
if
he
feels
that
he
can
give
a
good
explanation
why
he's
not
guilty.
i
should
think
he
could
do
that
pretty
easy.
mr.
william
a.
norris
i
think
that's
right
and
as
i
say,
there's
no
way
to
keep
a
man
from
volunteering
a
statement.
mr.
william
a.
norris
alright,
and
that
--
that
maybe
a
fair
position
but
i
think
it
should
turn
on
whether
he's
made
the
kind
of
waiver
of
constitutional
rights
that
this
court
requires
in
order
to
be
effective
and
that
very
well
maybe
the
practical
result.
mr.
william
a.
norris
i
would
agree
with
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
that's
why
i
believe
that
you
can't
automatically
from
the
words
of
the
warning.
i
think
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
qualities
and
the
capacity
and
the
education
of
the
accused
person
himself.
mr.
william
a.
norris
well
on
the
--
i'm
not
quite
sure.
i'm
never
quite
sure
what
that
means,
mr.
justice
clark.
i
must
admit
but
it
--
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
norris
on
waiver,
what
i
--
it
does
mean
certainly
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
age,
the
experience
etcetera
of
the
accused,
and
if
that
is
what
is
meant
by
totality
of
circumstances,
yes
that
must
be
taken
into
account.
on
the
question
of
waiver,
not
however
on
the
question
as
to
whether
we
have
effectively
reached
the
accusatorial
stage
which
is
just
another
way
of
saving
--
saying
that
we
have
reached
the
point
where
the
person
stands
accused
of
a
crime
by
the
forces
of
the
state
and
that's
i
believe
--
the
time
i
believe
when
he's
entitled
to
all
of
his
constitutional
rights
including
his
right
to
counsel
at
anytime
that
the
state
proceeds
against
him
in
an
adversary
way.
i
have
argued
as
an
alternative
ground
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
because
the
confession
was
elicited
during
a
period
of
illegal
detention
and
i
will
just
state
that
point
because
i
really
think
these
two
arguments
tend
to
run
together
in
terms
of
their
practical
effect.
the
fact
is
that
roy
stewart
was
held
for
116
hours
before
being
taken
before
a
magistrate
as
were
four
others
and
we
don't
know
the
realms
upon
which
they
were
arrested.
we
do
have
a
rather
remarkable
line
in
the
record.
the
sergeant
testified
that
the
other
four
were
released,
including
stewart's
wife
following
his
confession
on
the
fifth
day
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
connect
them
with
any
crime.
our
view
is
that
under
the
california
law,
they
must
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
without
unnecessary
delay.
the
state
argues
a
48-hour
maximum
in
terms
to
permit
a
116
hours.
i
think
that
is
--
that
you
can't
possibly
reach
that
conclusion
under
california
law.
without
unnecessary
delay
means
without
unnecessary
delay
and
they
must
explain
why
he
was
held
all
day
friday
when
the
courts
were
opened
then
all
day
saturday,
all
day
sunday,
all
day
monday
when
the
courts
were
open
and
they
finally
got
their
confession
out
of
them
on
tuesday
morning
and
took
him
before
a
magistrate
that
afternoon.
our
position
is
that
the
state
must
establish
reasonable
ground
rules
to
authorize
police
to
arrest
persons
and
to
hold
them
for
a
reasonable
period
until
they
can
get
them
before
a
magistrate.
a
valid
purpose
of
such
a
statute
may
not
in
our
view
be
to
hold
him
for
the
purpose
of
interrogation.
now
if
the
state
--
if
the
police
do
not
operate
pursuant
to
these
ground
rules,
then
the
police
are
operating
beyond
the
law
and
that
we
submit
is
clearly
a
deprivation
of
liberty
without
any
process
of
law
much
less
due
process
of
law
and
we
think
therefore
that
applying
wong
sun
the
exclusionary
rule
of
mcnabb
that
this
confession
obtained
during
a
period
of
illegal
detention
must
be
excluded.
mr.
william
a.
norris
in
downtown
los
angeles
--
mr.
william
a.
norris
in
the
watts
area,
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
area
of
the
watts.
mr.
william
a.
norris
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
include
by
pointing
out
that
there
are
issues
remaining
and
since
one
of
the
--
this
is
--
we
do
not
conceive
the
voluntariness
of
this
confession.
the
voluntariness
was
challenged
at
trial,
instructions
were
given.
it
appears
that
the
requirements
of
jackson
against
denno
were
not
satisfied.
the
california
supreme
court
expressly
reserved
that
question
for
a
retrial.
i
wanted
to
point
that
out.
there
is
also
a
question
under
griffin
against
california
since
the
prosecutor
commented
on
his
failure
to
testify
on
some
of
the
counts.
and
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
must
make
a
choice
it
seems
to
me
between
the
adversary
accusatorial
system
or
the
inquisitorial
system
and
i
think
those
who
argue
against
escobedo
are
caught
between
them.
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
this
practice
of
secret
police
interrogation
why
they
conducted
a
little
pretrial
procedure
here
against
roy
stewart
complete
with
tape
recorders
which
they
turned
on
at
their
convenience,
complete
with
an
accusing
witness,
complete
with
a
statement
that
the
handwriting
expert
testified
that
--
or
had
stated
that
he
had
signed
the
checks.
they
tried
him
in
the
back
room
of
the
police
station
and
held
him
as
long
as
they
needed
to,
to
get
finally
get
the
confession.
and
when
he
did
confess,
he
confessed
to
a
simple
act
of
purse
snatching.
he
was
very
careful
to
avoid
in
his
confession
saying
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
any
of
the
other
crimes.
he
confessed
that
he
run
up
and
he
took
a
purse
and
he
said,
he
was
asked
whether
he
kick
her
and
he
said,
“i'm
not
sure,
she
fell
i
think
and
well
apparently
she
hit
her
head
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
this
was
an
intentional
beating.
he
didn't
know
the
consequences
of
the
felony
murder
doctrine.
he
certainly
didn't
need
a
lawyer
at
that
time.
what
he
confessed
to
was
a
single
act
but
he
didn't
understand
what
a
legal
consequence
is.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
