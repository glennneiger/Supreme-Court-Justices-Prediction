we'll
wait
just
a
few
moments
until
they
get
seated.
mr.
flynn,
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
mr.
flynn,
you
would
say
that
if
the
police
had
said
to
this
young
man,
“now,
you're
a
nice
young
man
and
we
don't
want
to
hurt
you
and
so
forth.
we're
your
friends
and
if
you'll
just
tell
us
how
you
committed
this
crime,
we'll
let
you
go
home
and
we
won't
prosecute
you,”
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
technically
speaking
would
not
be
“compelling”
him
to
do
it.
it
would
be
an
inducement,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
--
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
that
is
still
within
the
fifth
amendment,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
fact,
we
have
held
that
cases
of
that
kind
that
confessions
are
bad,
haven't
we?
where
they
said,
“it
would
be
better
for
you
if
you
do,
we'll
let
you
go”
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
isn't
strictly
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
compulsion
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
we've
been
talking
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nelson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
doesn't
--
isn't
it
a
fact
that
most
of
the
states
have
a
regulation
that
the
prisoner
shall
be
taken
forthwith
to
a
--
before
a
magistrate
and
there
advised
of
his
rights
and
so
forth?
and
doesn't
practically
every
state
in
the
union
have
clause
preventing
people
from
being
compelled
to
testify
against
themselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
thus
--
so
in
that
respect
we're
not
much
different
to
the
gideon,
are
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
weren't
--
there're
just
an
awful
lot
of
states
that
weren't
giving
counsel
up
to
the
time
of
gideon.
they
had
a
rule
on
it,
maybe,
but
they
weren't
according
counsel
to
them?
chief
justice

warren
(voice

constitutional
doctrine.
that's
something
that
indicates
wisdom.
but
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
that
is
--
that
that's
not
addressed
to
the
question
on
the
historical
interpretation
in
the
constitution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
you
have
--
you
haven't
gotten
to
your
second
point,
and
there
are
only
two
or
three
minutes
until
closing
time.
would
you
mind
addressing
yourself
to
that
on
the
question
of
retroactivity?
chief

very
well.
we'll

mr.
nedrud.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this,
please,
mr.
nedrud.
if
you
agree
on
the
facts
that
escobedo
should
have
been
reversed,
what
would
you
say
as
to
the
man
who
did
not
have
a
lawyer
but
who
said
he
wanted
a
lawyer
before
he
talked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
do
you
say
we
should
not
encourage
him
to
have
a
lawyer?
are
lawyers
a
menace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
it's
his
professional
duty
to
raise
any
defenses
the
man
has.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
in
doing
that,
he
is
a
menace
to
our
administration
of
justice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
does
he
cease
being
a
menace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
said
he
did
--
he
did
if
he
inject
himself
into
it
before
the
trial
level.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
a
lawyer
as
you
say
--
he's
entitled
to
a
lawyer
under
the
facts
of
escobedo
and
the
lawyer
is
entitled
to
tell
him
that
he
doesn't
want
him
to
talk
to
the
police,
why
would
it
be
a
menace
for
another
lawyer
whom
the
defendant
didn't
wanted
to
do
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
we
put
it
on
the
basis
of
not
equalizing
anything
or
balancing
anything
but
on
protecting
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant
not
to
be
compelled
to
convict
himself
on
his
own
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
interpret
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
does
that
--
until
the
trial
starts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
where
do
you
get
that
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
that
been
the
way
this
court
has
read
the
constitution
as
days
gone
by?
chief
justice
earl
warren
answer,
you
may.

chief

but
do
we

do
we
have
the

investigatory
stage
in

i
had
known
that
we
could
arrest
people
for
investigation?
chief

yes,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
the
question
of
the
accusatory
stage,
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
accusatory
stage
had
commenced
when
a
man
found
himself
locked
up
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
somebody
has
accused
him
or
they
wouldn't
have
put
him
in

chief

have
they
a
right
--
have
they
--
chief

have
they
the
right
to
sus
--
put
him
in

because
they
suspect
him?
chief

this

ever
said
you
could
put

put
men
in

and
hold
them
there
during

of

unless
the

arrest
him
for

mr.

chief

we'll
recess
now.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
do
you
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
do
you
say
they
can
hold
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
its
one
thing
to
hold
him
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
checking
out.
what
they
know
about
him,
it's
another
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
--
it's
another
thing
to
interrogate
him
during
all
that
time
they're
holding
him
to
check
out,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
may
i
give
you
--
ask
you
what
you
would
do
with
this
case
and
that
it
happened
in
the
district
here
just
a
few
years
ago
when
--
say
four
years
ago,
when
they
were
arguing
the
mallory
decision
over
the
capital.
there
was
a
robbery
one
night
in
a
restaurant
and
the
robber
not
only
took
the
money
away
from
the
woman
cashier
but
he
beat
her
up
in
a
brutal
fashion.
and
that
she
gave
a
description
to
the
police.
and
the
police
went
out
into
a
certain
area
of
the
city
and
gathered
up
90,
not
nine,
but
90
people
who
might
answer
that
description,
got
them
out
of
bed,
threw
them
into
jail
at
night,
and
didn't
process
them
by
morning.
some
of
them
--
a
lot
of
them
couldn't
go
to
work
because
they
were
in
jail
for
suspicion
of
robbery.
now,
would
you
say
that
those
who
had
lawyers
there
could
get
out
and
not
be
interrogated
and
those
of
the
90
that
were
too
poor
would
be
entitled
--
they
could
be
interrogated
by
the
police
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
until
they
got
a
confession
that
they
happened
to
have
done
it.
it
happened
that
not
one
of
these
90
was
a
guilty
party.
they
found
him
later,
but
that
was
the
way
they
did
it,
90
people
they
threw
in
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
you
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
you.
they
were
arrested
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
if
they
could
get
on
the
phone
as
you
say
and
get
their
lawyers
and
their
lawyers
said,
“well,
don't
talk
to
them.
i
don't
want
you
to
talk
to
them."
and
they
would
follow
that
advice
then
the
police
could
do
nothing
with
them.
but
the
rest
of
them
who
have
no
lawyer
and
perhaps
were
poor
and
couldn't
at
least
at
that
time
get
a
lawyer,
do
you
think
that
the
police
would
have
the
right
to
retain
them
to
question
them
ad
lib.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
all
of
them,
whether
they
had
lawyers
or
not,
those
circumstances
would
go
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
don't
suggest
that
we
overrule
escobedo,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
general,
you
wouldn't
ask
us
to
weaken
escobedo
to
the
point
of
saying
that
a
man
could
be
interrogated
if
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
but
he
said
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer
and
he
could
not
raise
one
at
the
particular
time
either
because
of
lack
of
money
or
couldn't
get
him
on
the
telephone.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fawcett.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
lead
us
to
deciding
all
these
cases
on

of

mr.

chief

you
would
suggest
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ringer,
do
you
believe
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
believe
on
your
constitution,
the
police
without
having
probable
cause
to
the
person
who
has
committed
the
crime
can
arrest
him,
put
him
in
jail,
and
hold
him
there
for
the
purpose
of
interrogation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
general
principle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
principle
is
a
principle,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
don't
try
to
read
our
minds
of
what
we
might
feed
you
later
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let's
just
(voice
overlap)
when
we
ask
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
well
and
if
it's
made
on
probable
cause,
the
man
is
taken
to
the
--
to
the
jail,
he's
taken
there
preliminary
to
put
him
on
trial,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
when
does
his
right
to
counsel
attach?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
think
that
--
that
because
a
man
hasn't
hired
a
lawyer,
an
anticipation
of
being
arrested
that
he
should
be
treated
less
generously
by
the
law
than
the
man
who
perhaps
does
have
reason
to
believe
he'd
be
arrested
and
is
arrested
when
he
has
lawyers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
don't
they
apply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
--
you
say
that
if
he
had
not
been
guilty,
he
could
have
convinced
the
authorities
that
he
was
not
guilty
by
explaining
how
he
got
that,
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
say
that's
his
obligation
when
the
police
have
him
in
the
--
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
don't
you
think
that
at
times
a
man
might
need
a
lawyer
to
have
to
exculpate
himself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
that
test
be
that
he
was
informed
of
his
rights
by
the
authorities
before
they
took
a
statement
from
him
and
then
there
wouldn't
be
much
question
about
whether
he
knew?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
agree
that
--
agree
that
if
a
man
says,
“i
have
a
lawyer
but
i'd
like
to
talk
to
my
lawyer
before
i
talk
to
you.”
do
you
agree
that
in
that
case
the
police
should
interrogate
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
says,
“well
i
just
can't
go
to
a
phone,
i
just
can't
go
to
a
phone
and
call
because
i
don't
know
a
lawyer
but
maybe
my
friends
and
relatives
can
get
a
lawyer
for
me
sometime
during
these
proceedings
and
i'd
like
to
have
one,
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
a
request.
now
is
that
sufficient
in
your
opinion
to
prevent
the
police
from
further
interrogating?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
has
a
right
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
norris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
waiver
depend
to
some
extent
at
least
upon
on
the
kind
of
warning
that
he
was
given.
let's
take
two
extremes.
let's
take
one
where
a
district
attorney
has
been
arrested
for
crime
and
the
police
said
to
him
now,
“mr.
so
and
so,
you
--
you
know
what
your
constitutional
rights
are.
you
know
you
don't
have
to
testify
and
so
forth,
that
would
be
one
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
take
a
poor
illiterate
fellow
who
couldn't
read
nor
write
and
who
had
no
friends
available
or
family
available
and
they
just
went
to
him
and
said,
“you
know
what
your
constitutional
rights
are.
you
don't
have
to
testify
and
if
you
do,
we
can
use
against
you
and
so
forth.”
that
in
the
exact
quarters
that
they
--
that
they
spoke
to
the
district
attorney.
there
might
be
a
great
difference
there,
might
there
not,
as
to
whether
there
was
a
waiver
if
the
man
after
that
said
answered
the
questions
when
they
started
speaking
to
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
community
was
this
arrest
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
downtown
los
angeles.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
only
the
--
adjourning
of
two
three
minutes
you
have
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ringer,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
ringer,
isn't
there
in
this
rather
classical
case
as
to
what
can
happen
to
people
when
they're
just
brought
in
for
investigation
and
interrogated?
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it,
the
police
went
to
the
home
of
this
man
and
there
happened
to
be
some
neighbors
or
visitors
there
in
the
home
at
the
time.
they
found
some
stolen
goods
in
his
house
and
they
put
everybody
in
the
house
in
jail
and
they
held
him
there
for
five
days.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
moment,
let
me
finish
please,
held
him
there
for
five
days
until
one
of
them
confessed
and
that
being
stewart.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
when
he
confessed
and
only
when
he
confessed
did
they
release
the
other
five
who
spent
five
long
days
and
nights
in
jail
because
of
your
interpretation,
that
under
our
constitution,
the
police
have
the
right
to
arrest
people
and
hold
them
on
suspicion
perhaps
and
hold
them
until
they
get
ready
to
let
them
go.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
that
we
tried
the
theory,
they
didn't
seem
they
have
no
knowledge
of
these
other
people,
didn't
even
know
they
were
to
be
there
or
anything
else.
they
just
knew
that
this
fellow
had
passed
a
check
belong
to
a
woman
who
is
killed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
you
think
that
the
police
have
any
right
to
do
that
if
the
facts
were
as
i
stated,
that
they
went
there
to
be
--
to
get
this
man
because
he
had
passed
that
check
and
then
they
arrested
everybody
in
the
house
and
kept
them
in
jail
for
five
days
for
investigation.

well
before

case,
i
would
like
to
thank
counsel
for
--
on
both
sides
for
having
presented
very
strongly
arguments
in
all
of
these
cases
and
i
would
like
particularly
to
express
our
appreciation
to
those
who
took
these
cases
as
charity
cases
or
were
assigned
to
them
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
norris,
i
know
you
were
appointed
by
this
court
because
of
indigency
of
this
man
and
we
are
very
grateful
to
you
for
assuming
that
obligation,
it's
a
public
service
in
our
opinion.
mr.
fawcett,
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
fawcett
is
still
here
or
not
but
he
was
appointed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
number
761
and
we
thank
him
also
and
mr.
earle
was
appointed
through
the
legal
aid
society
which
we
asked
to
argue
the
case
and
our
thanks
go
to
him.
i'm
sure
that
mr.
frank
and
mr.
flynn
in
759
also
were
doing
this
as
a
work
of
charity
and
i'd
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
all
of
them
and
of
course,
our
appreciation
to
those
who
represent
the
interests
of
the
states.
it's
been
a
good
job
and
of
course
have
been
of
very
much
help.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
