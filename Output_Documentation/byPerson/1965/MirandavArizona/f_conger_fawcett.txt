mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
my
argument,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
disparity
in
the
record
of
this
case
as
disclosed
by
their
respective
briefs.
in
as
much
as
i
have
no
opportunity
to
discover
this
disparity
until
i
received
the
solicitor
general's
brief
this
weekend
after
i
arrived
in
washington.
this
is
the
first
opportunity
i've
had
to
do
so.
and
i
do,
do
so
unless
the
court
think
that
simply
because
i
took
this
case
on
court
appointment,
i
have
somehow
been
negligent
either
in
carrying
out
my
obligation
to
my
appointed
client
or
in
presenting
to
this
court,
to
the
best
of
my
abilities,
the
true
and
full
facts
as
i
knew
them.
the
discrepancy
occurs
in
that
while
my
knowledge
of
the
case
here
and
below
has
been
predicated
upon
the
official
record.
certified
first
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
here,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
makes
suitable
use
of
additional
materials
not
a
part
of
the
official
record
on
appeal,
never
made
available
to
me
until
this
past
saturday
from
the
kindness
of
your
clerk.
this
is
the
material
which
the
solicitor
general's
brief
refers
to
as
“supplementary
papers”
in
note
one,
page
one
of
his
brief.
consisting
of
certain
pretrial
administrative
papers
and
the
exhibits
in
the
trial
court,
suppose
those
exhibits
which
were
and
in
one
particular
significant
--
significant
particular
one
which
was
not
received
into
evidence
of
these
materials
as
i
learned
on
saturday
reported
to
this
court
in
late
january
of
this
year.
and
i
was
much
surprised
by
some
of
the
information
in
them
as
i
am
by
their
sudden
appearance
at
this
time.
i
agree
and
i'm
knowledgeable
as
to
the
way
of
the
court
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
should
be
considering
it.
i
do
know
however
that
in
view
of
their
11th
hour,
59th
minute
appearance,
i
am
inevitably
caught
somewhat
by
surprise.
i
will
try
to
the
best
of
my
ability
to
integrate
the
new
material
into
my
argument
here.
necessarily
that's
not
been
integrated
into
my
brief.
i
would
simply
ask
the
court
to
keep
that
in
mind.
excuse
me,
because
of
the
shortness
of
time
allotted
for
argument
as
well
as
presumably
the
court's
most
particular
interest,
i
will
limit
my
oral
argument
to
the
confession
issues
involved
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
there
are
two,
one,
whether
for
lack
of
counsel's
actual
presence
during
the
police
in
--
custody
interrogation,
petitioner's
two
confessions
were
properly
admitted
into
evidence
under
escobedo
versus
illinois.
two,
because
this
is
a
federal
case,
whether
without
regard
for
escobedo,
petitioner's
confessions
were
improperly
admitted
as
a
matter
of
federal
criminal
law
under
the
standards
of
mcnabb
versus
united
states
and
more
specifically
anderson
versus
united
states.
the
factual
circumstances
surrounding
the
confessions
maybe
briefly
stated.
on
the
evening
of
march
20,
1963
at
approximately
9:45,
petitioner
carl
calvin
westover
was
arrested
as
he
entered
his
parked
car
on
a
side
street
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
the
arrest
was
made
by
two
officers
of
the
kansas
city
police.
the
chief
purpose
for
the
arrest
was
the
suspicion
that
the
petitioner
was
involved
in
two
local
kansas
city
store
holdups.
both
petitioner
and
his
car
were
searched,
a
certain
packet
of
money
was
recovered,
and
his
car
was
impounded.
he
was
taken
to
the
kansas
city
police
station,
he
was
at
that
point
placed
in
a
lineup,
identified
as
to
one
of
the
local
charges.
thereafter,
the
police
booked
him
“for
investigation”.
at
that
point,
he
had
denied
all
criminal
activity.
the
following
morning
however,
the
kansas
city
police
apparently
according
to
hearsay
testimony
at
his
trial
did
obtained
a
confession
on
one
of
the
local
robbers
shortly
before
noon.
at
approximately
11:45
in
the
morning,
the
kansas
city
police
declared
themselves
through
with
the
petitioner
and
the
kansas
--
and
the
fbi
office
in
kansas
city
was
at
that
point
permitted
to
interrogate
him.
in
something
less
than
three
hours,
they
returned
from
the
interrogation
room
with
two
narrow
conformed
statements
or
confessions
to
the
two
federal
robberies
here
concerned.
the
confession
although
in
the
handwriting
of
one
of
the
interrogators
was
signed
by
the
petitioner.
each
of
the
confessions
were
cited
that
westover
had
been
advised,
that
he
need
not
make
a
statement,
that
any
statement
he
made
might
be
used
against
him,
and
that
he
had
the
right
--
had
the
right
to
consult
an
“attorney”.
each
also
recited
that
“no
threats
or
promises”
had
been
made
to
induce
his
statement.
each
also
recited
that
the
statements
were
“voluntary”.
by
the
time
these
confessions
were
secured,
westover
had
been
in
custody
for
approximately
17
hours.
he
had
not
been
taken
for
arraignment
or
loosely
arraignment
more
properly
preliminary
hearing
before
either
a
kansas
city
magistrate
or
a
u.s.
commissioner.
the
following
day
petitioner
made
certain
changes
in
his
statements,
still
in
custody.
the
federal
involvement
of
westover's
detention
had
included,
besides
the
confessions
themselves,
the
following,
one,
a
specific
telephone
request
prior
to
the
booking
“for
investigative
check”
from
the
fbi
that
“the
subject
to
be
held
for
them
also
for
questioning”.
at
this
point,
it
would
seem
appropriate
for
me
to
clear
out
the
principle
discrepancy
between
my
prior
understanding
of
the
case
and
with
what
the
solicitor
general's
supplementary
papers
now
do
disclose.
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
felony
warrant
from
sacramento,
california
to
which
the
arresting
officer
referred
and
to
which
his
arrest
report
preferred
was
a
warrant
on
these
two
federal
robberies.
the
government
however
states
and
in
one
of
their
supplemental
papers
indeed
seems
to
show
that
the
felony
warrant
sacramento,
california
was
a
state,
not
a
federal
warrant.
my
brief
is
of
course
in
error,
therefore
in
arguing
that
the
clear
federal
interest
was
shown
at
the
time
of
arrest.
however,
those
same
papers
which
the
solicitor
general
has
found,
mdo
clearly
show
that
at
least
by
the
time
of
the
booking,
if
not
the
arrest,
the
fbi
was
itself
very
interested
in
the
petitioner
for
its
own
purposes.
they
showed
that
the
booking
was,
in
fact,
at
least
as
much
for
the
fbi
as
for
the
local
matters
or
the
california
felony
warrant.
as
the
arrest
report
which
is
prosecutions
exhibit
12
for
identification
shows,
westover
was
not
booked
on
any
specific
charge.
as
in
haynes
versus
washington,
it
was
a
“small
book”
with
a
--
hold
for
investigation.
it
then
reads
--
well,
specifically
it
said
investigation
check-robbery.
but
then,
what
goes
on
to
list
--
the
two
matters
which
were
to
be
checked,
then
recites
as
follows,
prior
to
the
booking
--
prior
to
booking
the
subject,
information
was
received
from
fbi
agent,
leon
dub
that
westover
was
wanted
by
the
fbi
for
questioning
and
also
that
sacramento,
california
holds
a
felony
warrant
for
the
subject
which
will
be
forwarded
to
this
department.
and
concluding,
it
recites
carl
calvin
westover
was
booked
for
investigation
to
be
held
for
the
number
one
and
number
two
station
detective
units,
this
department
and
for
the
fbi.
curiously
it
appears
to
me
in
reading
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
there
is
quite
a
conscious
attempt
to
convey
that
only
--
the
only
outside
interest
--
the
only
fbi
interest
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
or
booking
was
the
felony
warrant
in
california.
this
may
not
be
conscious.
i
think
it's
certainly
reads
that
way.
the
facts
however
show
quite
the
contrary
that
there
was
an
independent
federal
request
for
detention
for
its
own
questioning.
the
supplemental
papers
also
showed
that
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
booking,
the
federal
authorities
one,
had
a
pretty
fair
ideas
that
petitioner
was
connected
with
the
two
sacramento
federal
robberies
enough
to
want
to
question
him,
and
two,
that
they
had
by
their
request
actively
contributed
if
not
to
the
arrest,
to
the
booking
and
to
westover's
subsequent
detention
for
investigation.
the
other
matters
of
federal
involvement
are
well-enough
documented
in
my
brief
to
warrant
the
passing
reference
here.
the
joint
federal
state
examination
of
the
recovered
currency,
the
joint
federal
state
seizure
of
the
top
coat,
the
joint
--
well,
excuse
me,
the
use
of
the
state
seized
gun
in
procuring
the
federal
confessions,
and
finally
the
transmittal
of
the
state
photographs
or
mugshots
to
sacramento,
california
for
use
in
the
case.
but
the
basis
of
these
facts
we
submit
that
under
both
escobedo
and/or
anderson
versus
united
states,
the
confession
is
very
legally
admitted.
notwithstanding
these
two
different
questions
in
this
case,
i
cannot
urge
too
strongly
that
both
questions
uncounseled
interrogation
have
protracted
detention
or
in
my
mind
both,
fundamentally
vital
to
determination
of
the
first
issue,
the
escobedo
question.
thus
it
would
seem
to
me
a
big
mistake
for
this
court
to
follow
the
lead
afforded
and
offered
by
the
attorney
--
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
the
two
governmental
amicus
briefs
filed
here
which
would
seek
to
segregate
these
two
items
into
two
separate
cellophane
packages,
one,
police
interrogation
and
as
the
second
element
quite
apart,
the
period
of
lengthy
detention.
as
four
of
the
five
cases
right
now
before
this
court
indicate
protracted
detention
for
interrogation
appears
a
routine
for
this
behavior.
it
is
precisely
because
of
this
detention
that
it
seems
to
me
the
need
for
a
safeguard
such
as
presence
to
coun
--
presence
of
counsel
has
had
to
be
evolved
by
this
court.
as
in
escobedo,
it
was
to
protect
the
incarcerated
suspect
from
unwittingly
or
inadvisably
relinquishing
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
evil
thought
to
be
corrected
by
an
escobedo
type
philosophy
is
not
the
street
corner
confession,
not
the
sole
bearing
spontaneous
confession
of
guilt,
not
the
“picture
straight
from
confusion
at
arm”
as
the
government
suggest
on
page
23
of
its
brief,
nor
indeed
does
it
have
to
be
and
this
perhaps
is
not
here
that
has
to
be
decided,
it
does
not
seemed
to
be
the
brief
question
and
answer
period
during
what
the
government
calls
the
completion
of
administrative
formalities.
what
escobedo
does
do,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
strike
at
precisely
the
very
same
evil
which
for
federal
law,
the
mcnabb-anderson
exclusionary
rule
sought
to
strike
out
over
20
years
ago,
the
secret
detention
for
purposes
of
eliciting
a
confession.
the
second
difficulty
i
find
with
the
solicitor
general's
approach
is
more
serious,
more
crippling.
the
department
of
justice
would
have
this
court
turn
back
the
clock
as
though
escobedo
and
its
precursors
such
as
spano,
white
and
massiah
did
not
exist.
thus
the
government
states
as
mr.
earl
has
earlier
alluded
to,
escobedo
was
in
fact
nothing
more
than
one
more
case
of
a
coerced
confession
determined
under
a
strictly
traditional
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
given.in
this
light,
the
government
expresses
some
amazement
that
the
present
case
was
before
your
court,
says
the
government
repeatedly
and
at
great
length,
there
is
“no
showing”
on
this
record
that
petitioners'
confessions
were
the
product
of
“coercion”
or
“overbearing”
on
the
part
of
the
interrogators
viewed
as
a
matter
of
the
“totality
of
the
circumstances”.
of
course
we
never
argued
that
there
was,
but
we
did
argue
in
our
brief
do
argue
now,
is
that
the
protracted
detention
combined
with
the
police
interrogation
is
itself
inherently
and
unavoidably
coercive.
in
that
sense
then,
mr.
justice
black,
as
opposed
to
the
two
petitioners
who
have
already
appeared
before
you
we
do,
yes,
claimed
the
confession
was
coerced.
we
believe
that
escobedo
went
farther
than
coerced
confessions.
we
believe
also
it
was
not
simply
a
question
of
the
wrong
to
be
righted
but
a
step
in
providing
a
remedy
for
that
wrong.
the
fundamental
philosophy
of
escobedo
seems
to
be
the
right
against
self-incrimination.
the
fundamental
force
of
escobedo
seems
to
be
the
understanding,
the
realization
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
necessary
to
remedy
that
situation.
under
traditional
views,
we
concede
this
particular
case
would
presumably
not
have
merited
nor
received,
reviewed
by
this
court.
we
submit
however
that
under
escobedo,
the
court
is
trying
to
establish
something
less
ephemeral,
less
open
to
case
by
case
statutes,
than
the
special
circumstances
type
role
of
a
betts
versus
brady.
finally
on
this
point,
i
would
suggest
that
the
solicitor
general's
entire
approach
to
the
problem
in
terms
of
police
necessity
versus
individual
rights
is
topsy-turvy
backwards,
has
already
discussed
some
of
his
alleged
police
needs
“are
entirely
wide
at
the
mark”.
they
themselves
draw
men
or
possibly
read
harris,
escobedo
would
it
not
--
would
not
in
any
case
interfere.
others
are
particularly
irrelevant
to
the
terms
of
this
particular
and
not
a
typical
case.
thus
his
reference
to
one,
the
unwitnessed
crime
or
the
police
officer
forced
to
act
"in
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
without
opportunity
for
detached
reflection".
quite
obviously,
these
are
most
thoroughly
inapplicable
here.
i
submit
there
are
(inaudible)
injured
--
conjured
up
in
order
to
frighten
this
court
back
from
what
it
has
already
held,
has
already
held,
and
it
is
not
completely
interested
in
coerced
confessions
under
traditional
views.
in
any
event,
however
the
approach
is
backwards,
the
court
has
affirmed,
in
loud
tones,
that
in
weighing
police
aide
and
individual
right,
the
balance
has
been
struck
in
favor
of
the
latter.
thus,
if
the
solicitor
general's
approach
of
a
case
by
case
evaluation
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
is
correct
and
should
be
adopted
with
exceptions
thereafter
to
be
carved
out,
we
submit
the
rule,
the
starting
place,
it
should
be
the
individual's
constitutional
rights
versus
self-incrimination
as
protected
by
the
right
to
counsel.
with
the
police
interference
with
those
rights,
the
exceptions,
being
the
matters
which
should
be
allowed
in
exceptional
cases
where
on
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
a
need
in
fact
is
shown
to
exist.
certainly
there
was
no
such
need
here
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
himself
stated
the
confessions
were
simply
the
‘frosting
on
the
cake'.
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
admits
the
other
evidence
was
overwhelming.
there
simply
was
no
police
need
at
all.
and
i
submit
that
mr.
seagull's
credential
is
notwithstanding,
we
would
find
that
in
many
cases
where
confessions
were
used,
there
would
be
no
need
at
all.
on
the
point
of
anderson
versus
united
states
--
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
i
think
i
would
have
to.
it's
a
difficult
point
and
i
think
it
certainly
should
be
briefed
and
argued
before
it
was
decided
by
the
court.
it's
not
presented
here.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
that's
right.
i
understand
that.
yes,
it
may.
it
may.
there
are
no
figures
on
any
of
it.
there
are
no
figures
as
to
how
much
--
how
much
need
there
is
for
a
confession
to
secure
its
fruits
when
perhaps
independent
police
work
would've
found
the
same
evidence
about
it
quickly.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
sir?
may
it
--
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
white.
on
the
anderson
point,
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
very
brief
comment.
even
conceding
that
as
i
now
discover
the
federal
authorities
had
no
part
in
the
original
arrest,
they
clearly
had
a
large
and
a
thoroughly
well-documented
part
in
the
subsequent
detention
for
investigation.
we
submit
the
many
pertinent
facts
and
factors
surrounding
petitioner's
arrest,
detention,
overwhelmingly
bring
the
case
within
anderson.
they
also
put
the
case
squarely
outside
united
states
versus
coppola,
365
u.s.
762.
there
it
was
found
the
federal
authorities
had
“in
no
way
caused
or
contributed
to
coppola's
detention”,
exhibit
12
for
identification
precludes
such
a
finding
here.
it
was
also
found
in
coppola
that
the
interrogation
by
the
fbi
“did
not
contribute
to
any
delay
in
arraignment”
since
he
was
initially
interrogated
by
the
federal
authorities
in
the
midnight
hours.
here,
when
the
interrogation
began
at
11:45
in
the
morning,
certainly
no
such
finding
can
be
made.
i
submit
that
if
the
court's
sanctions
were
occurred
in
this
case
simply
because
the
detention
was
nominally
that
of
the
state
although
not
for
any
specific
state
charge,
it
will
effectively
have
taken
all
(inaudible)
from
the
mcnabb
exclusionary
rule.
it
will
encourage
states
to
adopt
broader
and
broader
small
book
statutes.
it
will
openly
invite
federal
authorities
to
find
themselves
sanctuary
forbidden
to
them
directly
in
requesting
to
state
authorities
that
the
subject
be
held
for
them
also
for
questioning.
in
our
case,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
if
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
confession
should
have
been
excluded,
the
commission
should
be
overturned.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
words.
the
--
i
left
san
francisco
on
friday,
therefore
the
page
proofs
mailed
to
me
wednesday,
did
not
arrive
in
time.
it
certainly
is
not
solicitor
general's
fault.
the
printed
brief
mailed
thursday
did
not
arrive
at
that
time
either.
however,
i
do
think
it
is
a
little
odd
that
an
ex
parte
request
was
made
for
this
additional
material
on
january
14th
of
this
year
without
notifying
me.
i
think
it
is
also
odd,
curious
that
i
ask
to
the
exhibits
when
i
was
first
assigned
this
case
from
december
of
1963
and
could
not
get
them
and
now
suddenly
they're
here.
i
would
also
now
on
the
merits
make
a
few
comments
on
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said.
first
thing
that
the
record
has
absolutely
nothing
in
it,
then
he
turns
around
and
he
can
coax
this
wild
story
that
the
petitioner
decided
to
trade
a
federal
conviction
or
state
conviction
for
a
federal
one.
he
coursed
to
the
fact
the
trial
judge
in
california
so
commented
sometime
thereafter,
a
number
of
interesting
points,
first,
of
course,
the
state
charges
would
have
been
missouri,
not
california.
secondly,
he
is
presently
serving
a
sentence
of
30
years
with
under
federal
law
minimum
parole
of
20
years.
under
the
maximum
of
the
statutes,
he
was
convicted
on
there.
it
would
have
been
a
15-year
sentence
with
earliest
parole
permissible
in
slightly
less
than
34
years.
as
this
court
i
think
knows,
california
at
least
customarily
pardons
life
sentences
at
about
seven
to
nine
years.
the
sentence
under
california
law
would
have
been
five
years
to
life,
not
just
life
as
the
solicitor
general's
brief
points
out.
if
indeed,
westover
made
this
choice
to
trade
one
for
the
other
at
the
time
he
was
in
custody,
i
submit
that
shows
pretty
adequately
he
certainly
needed
counsel.
he
made
a
lousy
choice.
secondly,
on
the
couple
of
point
on
the
detention,
we
of
course,
are
not
arguing
here
nor
did
we
below
but
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
same
view
that
there's
nothing
illegal
about
state
federal
cooperation,
of
course
not.
there
is
however
something
illegal
and
i
would
submit
perhaps
unconstitutional
about
an
arraigned,
unadvised
detention.
it
then
becomes
a
question
of
looking
to
see
how
the
federal
authorities
contributed
to
that.
whether
or
not
missouri
has
a
small
book,
20-hour
statute
permitting
state
authorities
to
hold
without
a
specific
charge,
i
don't
think
we
want
to
encourage
that
in
federal
law.
this
court
need
not
reach
constitutional
proportions
to
strike
it
down.
i'd
like
to
quote
just
because
i
think
it
sound
from
what
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
coppola
decision.
it
said
if
this
cooperation
between
federal
state
authorities
reached
the
point
of
arresting
detention
by
local
police
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
federal
officers
now
not
the
only
purpose
perhaps
with
the
purpose
to
question
the
defendants
concerning
the
bank
robberies
for
a
period
of
time
forbidden
on
federal
officers
by
rule
5
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
admissions
thus
obtained
would
properly
be
excluded.
such
a
rule
prevents
federal
officers
from
evading
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
rule
5
(a).
i'd
add
just
a
few
words
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
colloquy
with
the
solicitor
general
on
the
right
to
counsel.
i
find
it
very
odd
that
the
standard
warning
that
the
federal
be
--
federal
bureau
of
investigation
gives
to
counsel
--
gives
to
accused
is
that
they
have
a
right
to
counsel
yet
the
solicitor
general
stands
up
here
and
says,
“oh,
but
they
don't
have
the
right."
i
can't
understand
whether
the
federal
government
is
talking
out
of
both
sides
of
its
mouth
at
the
same
time.
are
they
simply
empty
words
which
in
fact
mean
nothing.
finally,
i
would
like
to
comment
on
the
discussion
that
has
concerned
whether
or
not
a
person
without
means
to
provide
a
lawyer
can
say
or
will
say
i
won't
talk
or
i
want
a
lawyer
before
i
talk.
i
submit
first
it's
pretty
hard
for
a
person
in
detention
to
stand
up
to
the
police,
certainly
hard
for
anybody
except
some
experienced
criminal.
that
aside
however,
if
that
is
to
be
meaningful,
the
common
federal
practice
which
this
case
has
won't
assure
it,
that
is
to
say
unless
you
have
something
like
a
tape
recording
of
what
went
on,
a
verbatim
statement
of
the
questions
and
answers,
it
is
a
hollow
thing
to
say
and
ever
thereafter
to
know
of
whether
or
not
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
to
remain
silent
was
ever
intelligently
waived.
certainly
a
narrative
statement
such
as
this
where
the
federal
officer
in
just
what
was
said
and
puts
it
down
in
the
words,
"oh,
by
the
way,
i
wanted
to
--
i
would
also
like
to
say
that",
that
certainly
simply
shows
no
signs
of
a
waiver
or
much
of
anything
else.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
a
couple
of
points.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
i'd
comment
twice
or
there
are
two
ways.
first,
i
point
out
the
prompt
arraignment
statutes
on
the
books
of
well
over
half
of
the
states,
of
the
union,
and
point
out
that
as
this
court
knows,
they
are
commonly
ignored.
i
think
the
states
have
had
their
time
to
start
to
clean
this
up
and
they
haven't
taken
it.
i
would
comment
secondly
that
i
think
the
approach
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
is
very
sad.
they
say
--
you
needn't
say
a
right
to
counsel
is
ipso
facto
and
(inaudible),
the
only
way
we
can
protect
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
what
they
do
say
is
what
--
with
what
we
have
now,
that's
the
only
way
we
can
protect
that
privilege.
that
leaves
you
open
later
if
this
state
comes
up
with
something
else,
something
better.
perhaps
the
tape
recording
would
do
it,
then
at
that
point
you
would
say
that
is
an
acceptable
alternative.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
well,
as
i
interpret
escobedo
and
as
i
think
it
make
sense.
i
don't
really
find
myself
in
thorough
agreement
with
anybody
else.
the
american
civil
liberties
union
for
example
puts
the
right
very
heavily
on
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
but
as
i
said
in
my
argument
in
chief,
i
think
what
escobedo
did
was
to
device
a
means
to
protect
that.
i
think
as
it's
already
been
said,
they
are
both
and
they're
part
and
parcel
but
i
think
escobedo
went
more
than
malloy
versus
hogan.
it
went
to
the
position
of
saying,
“here's
a
cure,”
not
“here's
a
wrong,
it
must
be
righted,”
but
here's
a
wrong
that
must
be
righted,
that
maybe
righted
by
these
means.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
i
wouldn't
be
troubled
by
that.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
no.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
by
putting
the
footing
on
due
process.
i
think
probably
all
of
these
other
rights
ultimately
come
down
to
due
process
in
any
case.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
no.
as
i
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
reject
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
i
think
escobedo
rejected
them.
i
think
it
said
--
well,
i
think
it
said
we
might
--
you
must
have
counsel
at
this
focused
interrogation
point.
whether
you
say
the
reason
we
must
have
counsel
is
due
process
or
that
specific
provision
in
the
sixth
amendment
i
think
is
not
by
the
court.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
yes
sir.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
i
think
there's
a
different
history
which
starting
with
the
concurrence
in
spano
has,
as
i
say,
moved
away
from
a
necessity
of
viewing
every
case
on
the
totality
of
its
circumstances.
a
recognition
that
when
there's
behind
doors
interrogation,
you
can't
always
know
what
the
circumstances
are
that
escobedo
flowing
on
spano,
white,
massiah
has
gone
a
step
towards
rejecting
or
at
least
adding
a
new
qualification
to
the
conventional
totality
of
circumstances.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
no,
spano
did
not,
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
concurrence.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
yes
sir.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
that's
correct.
that
i
think
was
the
start,
it
was
not
of
course
the
majority
given.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
i'd
certainly
look.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
yes
sir.
mr.
f.
conger
fawcett
i
think
there
were,
that
there
were
many
cases.
thank
you.
