justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
flynn,
about
the
fifth
amendment?
let's
forget
it
that
if
an
amendment
could
provide
that
there's
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
disassociated
entirely
from
the
right
to
counsel.
you've
said
several
times,
seemed
to
indicate
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
witness
--
witness
or
a
person
could
be
compelled
to
commit
himself.
it
might
depend
to
some
extent
on
his
literacy
or
illiteracy,
his
wealth
or
his
lack
of
wealth,
his
standing
or
his
lack
of
standing.
why
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
why
does
the
amendment
not
compelled
--
not
protect
the
rich
as
well
as
the
poor,
the
literate
as
well
as
the
illiterate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
only
about
the
fifth
amendment's
provision,
"no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself."
does
that
protect
every
person
or
just
some
persons?
i'm
not
talking
about
impractical
effect.
i'm
talking
about
what
the
amendment
is
supposed
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
literacy
or
illiteracy
have
anything
to
do
with
it
if
they
compelled
him
to
testify,
whatever
that
--
whatever
comes
within
the
scope
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he'd
have
more
rights,
because
of
that?
i
don't
understand.
the
fifth
amendment
right
alone,
not
to
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
who
does
that
cover?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
cover
everybody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i
was
asking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
doesn't
have
to
have
a
gun
pointed
at
his
head,
does
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
you
add
to
that
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
state
had
him
in
its
control
and
custody?
why
would
that
not
tend
to
show
some
kind
of
coercion
or
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
allowed
to
get
away
from
there
at
will?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
had
moved
against
him
by
taking
him
and
to
question
him,
did
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall,
in
those
cases
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice,
as
i
recall,
in
those
cases
that
was
put
on
the
fifth
--
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
words
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
referred
to
in
the
early
case
by
chief
justice
white,
i
believe
it
was,
the
fact
that
inducement
is
a
compulsion
and
was
brought
in
that
category,
therefore
it
violated
the
amendment
against
being
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
yourself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it's
a
question
of
what
“compel”
--
what
“compel”
means.
but
does
not
depend,
i
suppose,
i
haven't
seen
it
in
any
of
the
cases,
on
the
wealth,
on
the
standing,
or
the
status
of
the
person,
so
far
as
the
right
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
our
system
compel
his
lawyer
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
he
was
compelled
by
our
system
to
do
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
does
he
do
it?
who's
--
for
what
purpose?
what's
the
object
to
that
going
to
the
part
of
the
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
something
about
giving
testimony
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
about
the
same
thing
as
a
practical
effect
and
object
of
the
amendment
which
says
he
shall
not
be
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself?
is
there
any
difference
between
the
objects
there
and
purposes
of
the
two?
what
the
lawyer
tells
him
and
what
the
fifth
amendment
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
that
the
object
of
the
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
fantastic
in
the
idea
that
the
fifth
amend
--
that
the
protection
against
being
compelled
to
testify
against
oneself
might
be
read
reasonably
as
meaning
there
should
be
no
pre-trial
proceedings
when
he
was
there
in
the
possession
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
a
valid
interest,
of
course,
if
they
can
convict
him
and
more
--
let's
say,
de
didn't
try
to
(inaudible)
try
to
convict
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
“one
thing
common.”
is
there
another
thing
common
as
to
where
they
were
when
the
confessions
were
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
there's
no
doubt
is
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
there's
no
doubt
is
it
that
the
provision
which
provides
for
the
protection
against
giving
compelled
testimony
as
a
consequence,
fewer
convictions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
stage
according
to
our
opinion,
he
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
at
some
stage
and
we've
said
as
i
recall
it,
haven't
we,
that
that's
at
the
stage
when
he
needs
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
least
the
appellee
has
been
detained.
what
about
the
point
to
where
a
man
is
seized
by
government
agents
and
they
are,
as
you
say,
they
are
our
agents.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
our
officers
and
there's
no
antagonism
between
this.
but
what
about
the
fact
that
when
they
are
seized
by
someone
who
has
power
to
detain
them,
keep
them
away
from
his
friend
and
their
relatives
and
in
seclusion
of
his
desire,
can
you
think
of
any
time
when
he
had
need
a
lawyer
more
than
that
at
the
point
of
detention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
a
prosecutor,
i
found
out
over
many
years
the
very
critical
stage
when
a
person
taken
to
a
police
headquarters,
nothing
wrong
with
that,
that's
part
of
our
government.
taken
to
a
police
headquarters
under
arrest
or
under
detention,
he
can't
leave
unless
he
wants
to
--
unless
they
will
let
him.
would
you
call
that
voluntary
for
him
then
to
--
for
them
to
have
him
there
in
that
situation
and
probe
him
about
his
public
conviction
of
a
crime?
would
you
think
of
that
as
voluntary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
he
have
to
have
a
counsel
if
the
police
when
they
arrested
him
and
detained
him
took
him
in
charge
just
left
him
alone
and
ask
him
no
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
let
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
answer
--
if
he
said
anything
voluntarily,
that
might
be
one
thing.
but
if
they
interrogate
him
then
he
--
unless
they
interrogate
him,
he
wouldn't
be
--
he
would
need
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wouldn't
need
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wouldn't
need
one,
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
interested
in
your
statement
on
justice
harlan
that
there's
absolute
--
did
you
say
absolutely
no
coercion
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it's
--
what
do
you
mean
by
coercion
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
completely
free
from
all
compulsion?
compelled
means
compulsion,
do
you
mean
completely
free
from
any
governmental
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wasn't
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
then
by
--
'was
not
coerced'
is
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
are
not
talking
about
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
well
as
the
confession
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
compulsion
here?
can
you
say
or
do
you
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
amendment
protection
means,
the
man
must
not
be
under
compulsion
to
give
a
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
that
mean
free
from
all
compulsions
or
we
just
construe
the
constitution
like
you
said
in
boyd
against
the
united
states,
giving
all
liberalities
to
what
its
means
and
what
was
intended
to
protect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that
is
true,
can
it
be
said
that
this
man
gave
the
confession
free
from
all
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
sense
we're
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
making
it
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it's
--
that's
right
and
it
didn't
refer
to
compulsion.
that
was
the
idea
of
looking
at
all
the
circumstances
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
see
if
it
is
too
offensive
to
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
constitutional
provision
is
that
they
shall
not
be
compelled
to
give
what
evidence
against
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
rather
too
merged
to
a
certain
extent,
has
been
almost
complete
emphasis
on
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
rather
than
emphasis
on
the
facts
that
the
man
is
not
to
be
--
the
government
is
not
to
take
confessions
from
him
by
compulsion
whatever
that
compulsion
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
he's
only
been
there
15
minutes
and
they
say,
“you
are
under
arrest,
we
think
you
committed
a
murder
and
we
are
taking
you
down.
we
are
going
to
interrogate
you.”
do
you
think
he's
on
any
compulsion
when
they
ask
him
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
logic?
i'm
talking
about
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
are
reviewing
a
whole
series
of
cases
with
reference
to
the
extent
covering
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
amendment
which
provides
the
right
to
counsel.
and
whatever
we've
said
in
the
past
that
there's
no
reason
why
we
shouldn't
discuss
and
counsel
shouldn't
discuss,
as
i
feel,
how
far
they
believe
the
fifth
amendment
protection
actually
goes
and
not
without
regard
to
what
we've
said
in
the
past.
justice
hugo
l.
black
once
--
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
want
to
get
back
to
betts
versus
brady?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
depend
--
if
you're
going
to
determine
it
in
each
time
on
the
circumstances,
as
demanded
by
the
records,
it
means
that
someone
has
just
--
has
said
to
you,
this
court
would
take
them
up
one
by
one
and
no
court
in
the
land
can
ever
know
what
violates
that
right,
not
to
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
under
--
it
comes
to
us
and
we're
finding
such
justice
hugo

black
there's
more
than
we
are
capable
of
doing
(voice

--
justice
hugo

--
at
the
present,
the
capacity
to
work
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference,
a
man
meeting
a
man
or
ask
him
if
he
wants
to
talk
with
them
in
some
way
or
other
and
taking
him
to
the
police
station
or
taking
him
in
charge
and
detaining
him
of
his
liberty,
quite
a
difference
between
voluntary
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
do
--
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
like
labels
and
therefore
i
don't
like
accusatory
stages.
i
like
to
consider
what
happens.
but
what
you're
talking
about
is,
as
i
understand
it
when
you
say
the
accusatory
stage,
that
the
government,
state,
or
federal
has
moved
against
the
man,
something
like
they
said
in
the
magna
carta,
has
moved
against
him,
and
from
that
moment
on,
they're
entitled
to
due
process
of
law
whatever
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
principle
--
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
the
bill
of
rights
had
something
to
do
with
making
that
balance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
any
doubt
is
it,
that
they
said
that
no
person
should
be
convicted
whenever
he
had
been
compelled
to
give,
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
question
of
a
society.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
uses
of
the
ideal
civilization,
when
that's
the
issue
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
that
protects
against?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
here
the
main
argument
we
have
is
whether
without
summoning
him
to
come
into
court
and
talk
with
that
process
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
can
be
seized
and
detained
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
interrogated
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
while
he
is
in
detention.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
that
is
--
whether
there's
any
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
what
that
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
what
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
any
more
than
the
fact
that
a
citizen
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
has
been
seized
by
authorities
and
kept
with
them
against
his
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
model
code?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
an
idea
that
the
model
code
so
far
as
protecting
people's
rights
against
the
government
are
concerned,
basically
speaking
had
to
be
found
in
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
we
long
ago
got
over
the
idea
that
this
country
tried
to
adopt
every
old
principle
of
the
common
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
nobody
could
agree
with
you
on
that
more
than
i
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
wrong
to
sub
--
would
it
be
wrong
to
substitute
for
that?
the
idea
that
the
individual
rights
should
not
be
taken
away
from
him
any
further
than
the
constitution
properly
defined
requires
instead
of
balancing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
shall
not
be
compelled
--
justice
hugo

--
not
to
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(inaudible)
the
definition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
agree
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wasn't
talking
about
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said
due
process,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
situation
that
justice
white
is
asking
about
invokes
any
principles
in
the
griffin
and
illinois
and
those
that
succeeded
it?
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
that
of
course
a
person
who
had
a
lawyer
--
who
had
the
money
to
get
a
lawyer
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
get
one
immediately.
but
this
man
has
no
lawyer
and
has
no
money
to
get
one.
and
the
only
reason
he
doesn't
have
a
lawyer
there
is
for
that
reason.
does
that
raise
an
inference
of
what
an
indigent
is
entitled
to?
he
said
you're
not
getting
treated
like
the
man
ordinarily
who
has
money
to
get
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
they
deny
--
justice

that

that
was
the
trouble
in
some
of
these
other
cases

fact,
the
state
can
have
a
new
provision
to
supply
him
a
lawyer
but
we
said
that
if
other
people
have
lawyers,
we
can
have
him
entitled
to
have
them,
entitled
to
have
lawyers
represent
him
at
that
point.
if
the
man
is
too
poor
to
get
one,
that
the
state
should
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
you
to
say
if
he
had
--
had
money,
he
would
have
a
right
to
have
his
lawyer
there,
at
that
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
have
a
right
to
--
but
the
man
who's
too
poor
to
get
one
has
no
right
to
do
it,
he
--
that
he
had
no
chance
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
situation
we
had
in
griffin
and
the
case
that
succeeded
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
it
was
a
different
point,
but
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
of
the
fact
that
in
the
trial
procedure
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
how
in
your
judgment,
from
what
provision
of
the
constitution
does
the
--
government's
power,
to
detain
him
there,
and
question
him,
to
detain
him
and
question
him,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
grants
that
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
well,
it
is
with
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
trouble
with
that
is
this,
that
i
have
no
doubt
to
what
--
the
government
has
the
right
to
make
inquiries
of
that
kind.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
is,
do
they
have
the
right
to
detain
people
as
though
they
are
under
arrest
for
the
purpose
of
questioning
him,
and
questioning
when
they
are
there
alone
and
detained
--
imprisoned
during
that
period
of
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
forbidden
by
this,
not
of
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
be
troubled
by
what?
would
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
if
you
look
in
the
note,
chambers
against
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
will
find
where
it
was
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
two
lines,
one
which
used
due
process
in
its
abstract
sense
and
one
which
applied
it
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
it's
a
precise
language
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
think
there
were
plenty
of
cases
cited
along
that
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
percent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
overall?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
28
--
27.5%
meant
that
that
many
people
had
been
detained
or
arrested
and
interrogated
while
they
were
under
detention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
what
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
inference
would
you
draw
from
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
all
be
possible,
you
were
trying
to
take
advantage
of
escobedo
and
what
it
held
by
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
it
not
be
a
little
confusing
to
talk
about
the
right
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
that
time?
of
course,
it's
never
been
done.
they're
not
ready
on
the
trial.
but
to
talk
about
it
to
say
that
means
to
compete
rights
to
appointment
of
counsel
to
continue
to
represent
a
man?
is
it
not
more
in
line
with
the
facts?
there's
a
man
under
detention
and
held
under
compulsion.
he
has
asked
the
questions
that
would
intend
to
incriminate
beyond
the
doubt.
and
the
court
simply
said
that
he
shall
not
be
compelled
or
he
shall
not
be
held
to
have
waived
his
constitutional
rights,
one
of
the
reasons
being
that
he
doesn't
have
a
lawyer
who
could
advice
him.
i
think
maybe
the
difficulty
of
getting
it
because
of
all
that
these
includes
to
be
--
talk
so
much
about
the
right
to
appoint
counsel
and
basically
the
question
here
whether
you're
going
to
admit
a
confession
given
by
a
person
who
is
held
under
compulsion
without
letting
a
lawyer
advice
you
so
that
he
could
determine
whether
he
could
waive
his
rights
to
--
not
to
be
compelled
in
discriminating
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
arguing
i'm
sure
that
we're
going
to
establish
a
new
rule
that
every
time
a
man
gets
arrested,
he's
got
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed
at
that
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
section
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
circumstances
that
come
up
which
showed
he's
held
in
custody
when
the
purpose
of
holding
usually
are
simply
to
keep
him
at
the
trial.
he's
interrogated
and
the
court
had
begged
what
it
held
that
you
couldn't
hold
with
that
man
and
waive
and
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
incriminating
himself
when
he
had
no
lawyer
telling
him
what
it
means.
justice
hugo
l.
black
undoubtedly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
that
connection
but
for
what
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
knows
it
by
the
six
policemen
around
that
and
he's
in
custody
and
can't
get
away.
justice
hugo
l.
black
say
about
what
you
think
about
compulsion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
think
about
it
as
the
old
drawing
had
gone
that
much
but
you
have
is
here
a
man
who
is
in
custody
of
the
law
can't
get
away
with
the
group
of
policemen,
probably
in
a
little
room
and
they're
asking
questions
but
then
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
maybe
we
shouldn't
go
too
far
in
saying
that
in
all
of
the
circumstances
and
condition,
the
man
who
was
arrested
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer.
it
can
be
said
we
are
simply
holding,
we're
not
going
to
let
any
confessions
in
that
were
taken
at
a
time
when
a
man
was
in
the
custody
of
the
law
and
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
to
advice
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
the
right
which
came
in,
in
advance
of
that,
that
the
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court's
held
a
long
time
ago
that
what
that
means
is
that
the
government
shall
not
compel
a
man
to
give
evidence
against
himself
anywhere
on
any
circumstances.
so
why
do
we
have
to
determine
when
the
prosecution
actually
began?
the
words
of
the
amendment
are
that
simple.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
been
construed
as
meaning
what
that
means
the
government
mustn't
compel
a
man
to
give
evidence
against
himself
of
anywhere
and
anytime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
you
--
as
far
as
you
were
taken
by
the
beliefs
those
who
come
down
they're
going
to
interrogate
you
about
a
murder
and
they
thought
you've
filed
the
committee.
they've
number
of
policeman
down
--
took
you
down
and
interrogated
you.
do
you
think
you
need
anymore
compulsion
then
that
show
that
it's
compelled
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
aside
from
anyway
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
held
many
times
that
a
man
can
knowingly
and
voluntarily
waive
a
constitutional
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
going
on
the
assumption
is
you've
got
to
say
we
compel
beyond
all
doubt
to
say
that
i
believe
you've
got
to
plead
of
the
counsel
in
that.
those
we
compel
beyond
any
adventure
to
say
that,
it
is
not
compulsory
or
the
government
dissented
the
police
agents,
take
the
man
in
with
a
large
number
of
--
get
him
down
into
a
little
room
by
himself
and
then
interrogate
him
about
whether
he's
guilty
or
not.
does
not
feel
compulsion
to
you
and
compelling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
--
that's
quite
difficult,
that
don't
have
the
waiver.
that's
why
i
said
maybe
in
the
escobedo
case,
if
that
was
brought
in
because
if
the
counsel
was
there
and
told
him
that
--
that
he
could
intelligently
waive
it
but
nevertheless
it
wouldn't
keep
it
from
being
compulsive
unless
he
made
up
his
own
mind
that
despite
the
fact
that
he's
held
there
secret
with
these
officers,
i'm
willing
to
go
the
limit
and
give
the
information.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
my
advice
of
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
that
would
--
that
would
be
enough
to
show
it
as
a
waiver.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
on
waiver.
