mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
state
of
new
york
is
appearing
not
only
in
the
present
case,
miranda
case,
but
in
the
ensuing
four
cases
that
have
been
scheduled
for
consecutive
arguments
in
which
these
problems
of
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
are
raised.
i
think
the
state
has
appeared
here
as
amicus
on
numerous
previous
occasions
when
there
has
been
a
constitutional
question
in
the
general
field
of
criminal
procedure.
the
nature
of
our
interest
is
stated
in
the
opening
pages
of
the
brief
and
i
do
not
believe
that
i
need
to
elaborate
that
orally.
excuse
me
--
i
should
add,
the
brief
that
has
been
circulated
to
the
other
states
and
has
been
joined
by
something
over
half
--
i
think
about
27
other
states,
as
well
as
puerto
rico
and
virgin
islands.
now,
i
will
try
to
say
what
i
have
to
say
in
less
than
the
allotted
time.
and
my
task,
its
brevity
is
the
easier
because
of
some
things
i
might
otherwise
say,
i
think
will
be
said
much
better
by
others.
and
i
also
try
to
say
a
few
things
that,
as
i
read
the
briefs,
no
one
else
is
going
to
say
or
at
least
say
in
the
same
manner.
the
factor
common
to
all
five
of
these
cases
is
that
a
confession
as
received
in
evidence
which
was
taken
when
counsel
were
not
present
and
when
there
had
been
no
waiver
of
counsel.
and
therefore
a
contention
that
runs
commonly
through
all
five
of
them,
that
is
the
one
that
emerged
i
think
most
clearly
and
that's
mr.
justice
black's
question
as
to
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
dimension
under
the
fifth
amendment,
or
for
that
matter
the
sixth,
or
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
telford
taylor
and
they
firmly
state
--
mr.
telford
taylor
pardon?
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
case
is
--
well,
they're
all
in
detention,
that's
also
--
mr.
telford
taylor
all
in
the
--
in
a
state
of
detention,
yes
sir.
otherwise
than
that,
there
is
quite
a
spectrum
of
circumstances
that
these
cases
reveal.
the
--
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
are
not
uniform.
now,
may
i
just
state
what
the
thrust
of
our
position
is
very
briefly
before
indicating
likewise
its
limits
and
why
we
are
taking
this
position?
our
contention
is
that
insofar
as
these
cases
present
a
constitutional
claim
that
a
valid
confession
cannot
be
taken
unless
counsel
is
present
or
has
been
waived,
that
that
claim
in
constitutional
terms
in
the
constitutional
dimension
is
not
sound.
in
other
words,
justice
black's
question
we
would
answer
in
the
negative.
the
fifth
amendment
cannot
be,
should
not
be
read
as
requiring
counsel
to
be
present
at
the
time
the
confession
is
taken.
i
will
come
to
my
reasons
for
that
very
presently.
our
secondary
position
is
that
if
the
court
should
decide
to
enunciate
a
rule
of
that
sort
in
constitutional
terms
or
other
new
rules
pertaining
to
the
validity
of
pre-arraignment
confessions,
those
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
but
should
be
prospective
only.
now,
before
speaking
in
support
of
those
two
positions
and
i
intend
to
spend
most
of
my
time
on
the
first
one,
may
i
make
clear
the
limits
of
our
position
here
and
what
we
are
not
saying,
because
i
think
this
is
of
almost
equal
importance.
we
are
not
taking
any
position
for
either
affirmance
or
reversal
of
any
of
these
five
cases.
that
is
because
all
five
of
them,
as
we
see
it,
involve
problems
or
possible
problems
that
go
beyond
the
limits
of
our
contention
here.
in
the
miranda
case,
its
just
been
argued,
there
is
obvious
to
this
--
division
of
opinion
about
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant,
about
whether
the
warning
that
mr.
justice
fortas'
questions
were
directed
to,
was
given
at
a
meaningful
stage,
what
the
significance
of
that
warning
is
in
legal
terms.
the
other
five
cases
involve
questions
of
trial
procedure
in
which
we
are
not
presently
interested.
they
also,
two
of
them
involved
a
long
period
of
detention
from
which
counsel
are
making
arguments
derived
from
the
mcnabb-mallory
principles.
we
are
not
taking
a
position
on
those
matters
and
therefore
we
could
not
say
that
in
any
one
of
these
five
cases
we
are
supporting
an
affirmance
or
reversal.
secondly,
may
i
make
quite
clear
that
we
are
not
saying
that
new
rules
about
requiring
counsel
to
be
present
when
an
inter
--
whether
an
investigation
is
taken,
interrogation
is
made
or
a
confession
taken,
we
are
not
saying
that
such
rules
are
necessarily
unwise,
without
merit.we
say
that
these
are
not
matters
of
constitutional
dimension.
but
we
do
not
say
that
they
might
not
be
very
wise
rules
to
adopt.
in
fact,
we
are
saying
that
this
whole
problem
of
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
pre-arraignment
stage
can
we
think
be
more
appropriately
and
perhaps
better
dealt
with
in
the
legislative
dimension
and
in
the
area
of
judicial
policy
rather
than
on
purely
constitutional
terms.
now,
of
course,
insofar
as
we
say
there's
no
constitutional
basis
here,
our
position
cuts
against
the
defendants.
but
as
i
repeat,
we
are
not
taking
a
position
against
such
rules
found
in
other
ways,
through
legislative
means,
through
judicial
policy,
or
otherwise.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
inclusion
of
these
five
cases,
one
federal
case,
the
westover
case,
number
761,
i
think
underlines
this
distinction
that
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
state,
and
it
also
discloses
the
one
respect
in
which
i
think
our
position
departs
from
that
which
taken
by
the
solicitor
general.
as
a
federal
case,
this
being
a
confession
taken
by
federal
agents
introduced
in
evidence
in
a
federal
prosecution,
i
would
suppose
that
the
westover
case
is
susceptible
of
disposition
in
non-constitutional
terms
under
this
court's
federal
supervisory
jurisdiction,
as
enunciated
in
the
mcnabb-mallory
cases
and
that
general
line
of
authority.
as
i
read
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
however,
he
is
saying
not
only
that
the
constitution
does
not
raise
a
requirement
of
the
presence
of
counsel,
but
is
also
saying
that
such
a
rule
should
not
be
laid
down
by
this
court
as
a
matter
of
judicial
policy
in
the
way
it
was
done
in
mcnabb
and
mallory.
our
position
does
not
extend
to
that
second
step.
we
do
not
take
any
position
one
way
or
the
other
on
it.
i
think
it
entirely
appropriate
to
say
though
that
that
would
be
a
dimension
in
which
we
would
consider
this
court
might
very
appropriately
deal
with
the
matter.
one
further
thing
on
--
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
i
--
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
was
pointing
out
that
the
westover
case
brings
that
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it's
only
in
the
westover
case
that
you
can
do
that.
mr.
telford
taylor
quite
right.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
that's
correct.
the
states
are,
of
course,
affected
only
by
the
constitutional
dimension.
the
federal
courts
are
subject
to
a
broader
range
of
review.
i
might
add
that
in
new
york
our
own
court
of
appeals
has
noted
and
acted
upon
this
very
distinction
between
decisions
in
the
constitutional
dimensions
and
considered
--
and
decisions
in
the
domain
of
judicial
policy.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
if
your
honor
is
asking
whether
--
what
the
reasons
for
drawing
the
distinction
between
the
trial
stage
and
the
pre-trial
stage
may
be
--
mr.
telford
taylor
wrongly
decided?
no.
and
indeed,
in
new
york
state,
this
would
be
treated
now
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
requirement.
there's
no
question
about
that
in
my
mind.
but
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
telford
taylor
in
the
dimension
we're
talking
about,
that
is
the
pre-arraignment
right
to
counsel.
new
york
state
held,
prior
to
escobedo,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
whereas
in
escobedo,
there
was
an
inference
by
the
police
authorities
with
the
access
of
counsel
to
his
client.
that
this
was
in
the
constitutional
dimension,
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
rights.
this
case
is
cited
with
approval
in
the
escobedo
decision.
just
last
year,
it
went
further
than
that,
the
court
of
appeals
and
held
that
if
there
is
a
telephone
call
from
counsel
to
the
police
authorities
asking
that
there'd
be
no
more
questioning
of
the
client,
that
any
questioning
that
takes
place
after
that
cannot
result
in
admissible
admissions
or
confessions.
but
when
the
further
question
was
raised
in
a
case
where
counsel
arrived
at
the
station
while
a
confession
was
being
taken,
the
state
made
the
contention
that
that
part
of
the
confession
that
took
place
before
counsel
arrived
could
be
admitted
and
not
the
latter
part.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
court
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
that
brings
me
back
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
and
its
relation
to
the
ones
you
have
been
putting,
mr.
justice
fortas.
and
that
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
constitution,
either
in
the
sixth
amendment
assistance
of
counsel
clause,
or
in
the
due
process
clause,
or
in
the
protection
against
self-incrimination,
whether
any
of
those
clauses
together
or
conjointly
should
be
read
as
requiring
counsel
in
the
pre-arraignment
stage.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
is
going
to
approach
that
question,
one
must
enunciate
a
constitutional
theory.
are
we
looking
to
history
and
original
meaning
of
the
constitution
or
are
we
looking
to
contemporary
standards?
is
the
constitution
to
be
treated
as
fluid
with
different
and
perhaps
more
rigorous
meanings
obtained
by
common
consent
at
a
later
time,
or
are
we
to
look
to
the
original
understandings,
it
has
been
called?
now,
i
suggest,
with
all
respect,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
in
those
terms
it's
very
difficult
to
support
the
contentions
being
made
here
and
the
situation
is
quite
different
from
gideon,
quite
different.
i
forget
the
exact
number
of
states
that
already
were
furnishing
counsel
in
all
criminal
trials
at
the
time
of
gideon,
but
my
recollection
is
that
there
wasn't
more
than
a
handful
that
weren't
already
doing
this
as
a
matter
of
state
practice.
therefore,
one
had
a
very
broad
practice
and
consensus
in
the
states
on
this
very
point.
the
same
thing,
if
i
may
say
so,
was
true
in
the
mapp
case,
to
a
lesser
extent.
in
mapp,
you
had
about
half
the
states
that
were
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
trend
was
solidly
in
that
direction.
california
had
changed
its
view
between
wolf
and
mapp
so
that
in
both
of
these
situations
you
had
a
solid
basis
in
practical
experience
in
the
states
and
really,
your
decision
was
not
revolutionary
in
those
terms.
but,
in
the
dimension
that
we're
now
talking
about,
i
don't
know
of
a
single
state
that
presently
excludes
confessions
that
are
taken
pre-arraignment
in
the
absence
of
counsel.i
don't
think
there
is
such
a
jurisdiction.
mr.
telford
taylor
indeed
that
is
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
well
--
mr.
telford
taylor
my
understanding
is
that
at
the
time
of
gideon,
all
but
a
very
few
states
were
indeed
according
full
right
of
counsel
at
the
trial
stage
which
is
what
gideon
relate
it
to.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
we
have
no
such
basis
in
precedent
and
established
practice
when
we
are
coming
to
the
pre-arraignment
stage
nor
do
we
have
--
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
indeed.
on
the
basis
of
historical
interpretation,
i
think
one
would
be
hard-put
to
it
to
find
any
basis
for
finding
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
pre-arraignment
stage
much
less
the
right
to
be
furnished
counsel
if
you
are
indigent.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
the
stronger
arguments
for
the
claim
advanced
here
is
not
the
historical
basis,
but
the
common
consensus
basis.
and
it
is
on
that
basis
that
i
was
suggesting,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
we
--
we
don't
have
the
gideon
situation
here
at
all.
this
court
is
being
asked
to
enunciate
a
rule
for
which
there
is
no
basis
in
the
prevalent
practice.
mr.
telford
taylor
and
for
that
reinterpretation,
there
was
abundant
support
in
what
one
could
see
around
one.
mr.
telford
taylor
and
a
commonly
accepted
view
that
this
was
a
very
desirable
thing.
we
don't
have
that
here.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
telford
taylor
on
retroactivity?
well
actually,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
point
flows,
i
would
think
as
a
matter
of
logic,
from
our
first
proposition
if
that
be
accepted.
if
as
we
see
it,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
claim
based
on
an
original
understanding,
if
this
is
a
matter
that
will
be
evolved
from
contemporary
practice
and
changing
standards,
why
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
apply
such
a
rule
retroactively
presents
considerable
conceptual
difficulties.
and
i
find
no
conceptual
difficulty
in
a
prospective
application.
the
court
has
confronted
this
now
twice
in
linkletter
and
tehan.
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
the
reasons
why
it
seems
to
us
the
considerations
the
court
went
on
there
are
applicable
here.
i
might
say
also,
that
if
we
are
to
hope
for
legislative
progress
and
for
action
within
the
states
by
their
own
courts,
why
a
principle
of
retroactivity
may
be
a
damper
on
change
and
improvement
rather
than
a
stimulus
to
it.
this
would
tend
to
freeze
things
and
make
people
reluctant
to
develop
new
practices
if
everything
else
has
to
be
unwound
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning
to
make
the
new
practice
prevail.
