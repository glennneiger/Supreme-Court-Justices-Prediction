mr.
william
i.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court
will
--
for
giving
personal
reference,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
myself.
i've
been
a
prosecutor
now
for
26
years,
ten
of
those
years
very
busily
engaged
in
the
trial
of
cases
and
my
quick
computation
16
years
as
the
head
of
the
appeals
bureau
in
the
kings
county
district
attorney's
office.
but
i
was
a
citizen
became
--
before
i
became
a
prosecutor
and
i
trust
that
i
am
still
a
citizen
despite
this
long
record
of
public
service.
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
think
some
of
my
colleagues
professionally
and
officially
have
said
things
and
seemed
to
me
to
have
made
concessions
with
which
i
do
not
agree.
and
i
think
that
there
has
been
much
--
too
much
talk
of
the
police
on
the
one
side
and
the
defendant
on
the
other
side
and
not
enough
reference
to
the
rights
of
the
community.
and
the
--
if
i
may
this
is
the
point
of
view
that
i
want
to
espouse
here
this
morning.
may
i
say
in
passing,
that
i
have
briefed
the
question
of
retroactivity,
i'm
either
a
prophet
nor
a
prophet's
son,
but
like
one
of
my
ancient
ancestors,
i'm
willing
to
prophesy
that
there
is
at
least
a
possibility
of
some
decision
coming
out
of
this
argument
on
these
cases
with
which
i
would
perhaps
be
unhappy.
in
any
event,
which
might
raise
the
question
of
retroactivity,
i
do
not
argue
with
because
this
case
is
not
--
has
not
become
finalized
within
the
definition
in
linkletter,
but
i
brief
it
because
new
york
obviously
has
a
great
interest
in
the
question
of
retroactivity.
we
have
thousands
of
cases
i
suppose
where
convictions
were
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
confessions.
my
very
able
young
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we
tried
to
do
that
when
these
cases
were
allowed
up
by
the
court
and
i
think
it's
obvious
that
we
didn't
have
very
much
time
in
which
to
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
we
don't
have
in
my
judgment
that
type
of
empirical
data
that
mr.
justice
stewart
spoke
about
on
which
the
court
could
put
very
much
reliance.
for
myself,
i
put
--
i
base
my
argument
on
the
importance
of
confessions
on
human
nature,
and
human
experience,
and
human
evaluation.
it's
a
principle
of
conduct
that
people
don't
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
of
conduct,
of
human
life,
that
people
don't,
as
a
rule,
confess
crimes
which
they
haven't
committed.
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
courts
have
always
said
that
a
true,
honest,
unforced,
and
uncoerced
confession
is
the
highest
type
of
evidence.
and
what
our
point
here
really
is,
is
that
we
don't
want
to
be
deprived,
we
don't
want
to
lose
the
opportunity
to
get
that
type
of
evidence
not
for
ourselves,
not
for
any
prosecutorial
records,
not
for
the
satisfaction
of
winning
a
case
because
i
hope
we
are
given
the
benefit
of
the
presumption
that
we
are
above
that
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
community.
and
so
i
would
answer
you
sir
that,
if
i
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
in
the
seat
of
decision,
i
wouldn't
lay
too
much
stress
on
presently
at
least
unavailable
data
of
that
type.
mr.
nedrud
has
tried
to
get
some
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
district
attorneys
and
in
his
brief
he
has
some
statistics.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
doesn't
go
very
far.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
think
it
really
can
because
after
all
when
we
try
a
case
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
we
don't
write
up
and
say,
we
got
this
conviction
because
of
a
confession
and
wouldn't
have
--
it
wouldn't
have
happened
if
it
hadn't
been
for
a
confession.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
yes.
where
the
con
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
where
the
confession
is
the
only
evidence.
of
course
sometimes
it
happens
that
the
confession
is
later
found
to
be
false.
if
one
reason
or
another
happens
either
in
this
court
as
witness
(inaudible)
on
what
happens
in
the
lower
court.
but
there
are
cases
where
only
the
confession
is
available
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
but
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
there
had
been.
the
records
of
this
court
contained
two
to
--
within
my
own
experience.
and
there
are
others
where
this
is
so
but
if
--
i
hope
there
won't
be
too
much
importance
laid
upon
this
fact
because
the
impropriety
to
the
confession
in
these
specific
cases
is
only
a
proof
of
what
we
all
know
that
no
human
institution
is
perfect.
and
that
we
can't
expect
or
require
from
a
prosecutorial
system
that
perfection
which
is
wanting
in
every
other
department
of
human
affairs.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
know
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
undoubtedly
sir.
i
had
said
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
your
honor
if
i
may
refer
to
your
second
desideratum
first.
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
the
hallmark
of
western
civilization
to
use
the
command
of
this
court.
it
is
the
command
of
the
constitution.
it
is
the
desire
of
all
proper
thinking
people
that
justice
shall
prevail
according
to
civilized
standards.
my
point
is
that
the
standard
--
well,
let
me
first
dis
--
second
disposed
of
your
first
desideratum.
what
you
posed
it
seems
to
me
is
an
ideal
that
no
man
shall
ever
under
any
circumstances
be
convicted
under
an
improperly
procured
confession.
now,
this
is
an
ideal
and
an
ideal
by
their
terms
of
definition
is
unattainable.
the
only
point
i
make
is
that
because
under
a
standard,
which
i
prefer
to
any
set
rules
which
is
what
my
brilliant
young
opponent
is
arguing
for,
the
standard
works
well
and
enables
courts
to
perform
their
true
function.
and
the
true
function
of
the
court
is
to
find
out
where
the
truth
lies.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
your
honor
i
hope
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
you
won't
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
hope
you
won't
believe
that
i
disagree
with
your
logical
objectives.
the
largest
social
objectives
that
you
posed
when
i
say
that
there
is
an
immediate
objective
also
and
the
immediate
objective
is
to
protect
society
because
if
society
isn't
protected,
if
in
one
degree
or
another
elapses
into
anarchy
because
of
criminality,
then
the
opportunity
to
reach
this
beautiful
ideal
is
gone
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
and
it
is
the
function
of
the
policeman
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
the
conviction
is
only
a
means,
let
me
say,
to
a
larger
end.
and
a
larger
end
is
the
preservation
of
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
commonwealth
for
the
good
of
everybody
who
resides
in
that
commonwealth.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
this
is
inherent
in
the
--
in
our
social
structure.
and
i
suppose
the
problem
that
these
cases
pose
is
--
well,
i'll
start
again.
there's
no
aphorism.
it's
a
principle
of
law
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
is
better
that
100
men
--
guilty
men
go
free
then
that
one
--
one
innocent
man
to
be
convicted.
and
this
aphorism
expresses
a
point
of
view
with
which
everybody
is
in
agreement
but
it
isn't
a
mathematical
equation.
there
isn't
an
exact
100
to
1
ratio.
it's
an
expression
of
a
philosophy
and
the
problem
that's
before
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
is
just
how
to
keep
the
balance
between
the
ultimate
necessities
of
a
civilized
peaceful
society
and
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
specific
defendant.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
because
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
because
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
because
the
bill
of
rights
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
the
bill
of
rights
only
says
that
he
shall
not
be
compelled.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
but
the
word
compelled
is
not
self-defining.
what
compelled
means
comes
from
this
bench.
now,
we
--
for
many,
many
years
we're
told
by
your
honor's
predecessors
and
i
would
say
by
a
great
majority
of
your
honor's
predecessors
that
compelled
meant
that
you
couldn't
make
a
man
talk
by
the
exercise
of
process.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
the
exercise
of
process.
you
couldn't
subpoena
him
into
a
court
and
subpoena
on
the
pain
of
punishment
make
him
talk.
nobody
disagrees
with
that.
and
i
take
it
that
we
are
beginning
to
lift
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
fine.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
now,
escobedo
says
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
escobedo
says,
as
i
understand
it,
escobedo
says
that,
when
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
or
a
lawyer
asks
for
him
to
make
him
to
--
a
lapsus
linguae
--
to
take
from
him
a
statement
after
the
rejection
of
these
request
is
compulsion.
if
i
get
your
honor's
point
of
view,
it
is
that
you
don't
have
to
wait
until
he
is
in
the
accusatorial
stage
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
that
when
he's
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
may
i
venture
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
may
i
venture
a
definition?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
the
accusatorial
stage
is
when
the
police
have
a
prima
facie
case
and
it
has
become
their
duty,
a
magistrate
or
a
commissioner
being
available,
to
being
him
to
that
functionary
for
arraignment.
this
is
a
true
accusatorial
stage.
but
i
have
a
question,
if
he
is
entitled
and
escobedo
says,
he's
entitled
not
to
be
questioned
at
that
point,
why
isn't
he
entitled
to
be
--
not
to
be
questioned
at
the
very
point
when
he's
under
police
restraint
so
as
to
stop
the
probability
or
even
the
possibility
that
by
questioning
the
police
will
put
him
in
the
accusatorial
stage?
to
me,
there's
a
lack
of
logic
in
making
this
distinction
between
the
investigative
or
investigatory
process
on
the
one
hand
and
the
accusatory
stage
on
the
other
hand,
because
you
don't
reach
so
far
as
the
participation
of
the
arrestee
is
concerned,
you
don't
reach
the
accusatory
stage
until
you
first
had
the
investigatory
stage.
and
it
is
wrong
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
i
am
using
--
i
am
using
the
terminology
of
escobedo
which
makes
the
distinction.
you
can
ask
people
to
come
in
and
talk,
no
question
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
about
that
and
you
don't
have
to
invite
them
in
with
a
lawyer.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
somebody
may
suspect
him,
but
they
haven't
accused
him
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
accusation
is
they
took
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
it's
an
old
common
law
right
as
i
understand
it,
to
stop
a
person
and
detain
him
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time
for
--
for
discussion
and
investigation.
i
don't
think
this
has
ever
been
disputed.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
it's
like
many
other
things
your
honor,
its
relative.
i
think
it's
been
recognized
as
a
whole
model
code
on
the
right
to
detain,
it's
in
preparation.
new
york
has
passed
the
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
sir?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
how
sir?
no,
sir
but
your
honor
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
agree
with
you
your
honor,
but
may
i
say
this
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
agree
with
that,
but
may
i
also
say
that
what
we
are
talking
about
in
everyone
of
these
cases
is
a
question
of
definition
and
what
the
constitution
means?
now,
i
know
that
the
constitution
has
been
differently
defined
in
different
eras
and
i
know
also
that
we
are
in
a
period
of
the
history
of
this
court
where
the
changes
in
definition
are
rather
accelerated,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
but
case
by
case,
the
question
always
is
--
is
man
--
does
man
live
alone
or
is
he
a
member
of
this
community?
and
doesn't
the
community
have
some
rights
under
the
constitution?
now
it
maybe
that
what
the
community
had
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
alright.
now
then,
--
then
we
always
reach
a
question
of
the
accommodation
of
these
rights.
the
community
must
not
for
it's
own
benefit
take
away
any
of
the
rights
of
the
individual,
but
the
individual's
rights
must
not
be
defined
beyond
the
point
where
they
are
necessary
to
protect
him
from
oppression
by
the
community.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
and
if,
from
any
point
of
view
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
mr.
justice
black,
it
is
with
the
greatest
respect
to
you
that
i
say
this
is
a
matter
of
semantics
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
semantics,
because
the
constitution
does
not
define,
the
bill
of
rights
does
not
define
what
a
man's
rights
in
any
given
circumstances
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we
have
to
come
here.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we've
always
had
to
come
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we've
always
had
to
come
here
to
find
out
what
compulsion
meant.
we
didn't
know
--
well,
let
me
--
i
find
mr.
--
i've
always
find
--
found
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
be
not
only
a
great
stylist
but
a
great
student
of
the
constitution
and
it
is
for
this
reason
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i
have
no
doubt.
i
have
no
doubt
that
despite
your
classic
divergences
of
opinion
in
adamson
against
california
and
others,
cases
you
and
mr.
justice
frank
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
the
highest
regard
for
each
other.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
you
should
have
a
--
as
a
practical
matter,
an
equivalent
of
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
for
the
states,
and
not
just
exactly
when
the
right
to
counsel
applies
although
i
think
i'll
give
you
an
illustration
which
might
almost
drive
us
all
to
the
point
where
he
needs
counsel.
the
minute
he
stopped
and
said,
“will
you
please
come
down
to
the
station?
we
want
to
question
you?”
it
is
--
the
question
is
and
ought
to
remain
what
it
has
always
been
and
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
about
it
in
columbia.
“the
ultimate
test
remains
that
which
has
been
the
only
clearly
established
test
in
anglo-american
courts
for
two
hundred
years,
the
test
of
voluntariness.
is
the
confession
of
the
product
of
an
essentially
free
and
unconstrained
choice
by
its
maker?
if
it
is,
if
he
has
willed
to
confess,
it
may
be
used
against
him.
if
it
is
not,
if
his
will
has
been
overborne
and
his
capacity
for
self-determination
critically
impaired,
the
use
of
his
confession
offends
due
process.”
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wasn't
talking
about
a
mythical
man.
he
wasn't
talking
about
a

mr.

no,
i
think
he
was

(voice

--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
it
wasn't
involved
there.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
--
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
cons
--
and
the
sixth
amendment
are
going
to
be
brought
in
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
even
independently
there
still
remains
a
question.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
(inaudible),
we
have
this
right,
we've
had
this
right
to
counsel
long
before
it
became
a
pressing
question
in
betts
against
brady
or
powell
against
alabama
or
gideon
or
any
of
it.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
yes.
we
couldn't
dispose
off
the
volume
of
our
business
if
we
didn't
have
85
or
90%
pleas
of
guilty.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
but
of
course,
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
is
after
the
lawyer
has
learned
of
the
strength
of
the
people's
case
and
i
don't
think
this
has
any
relationship
whatever
to
the
problem
of
the
lawyer
talking
to
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
arrest
or
accusatorial
stage.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
because
in
my
experience
and
i
have
dealt
with
hundreds
of
lawyers
who
specialize
in
the
criminal
practice,
it
is
a
rather
obvious
indeed
to
whatever
if
he
comes
into
the
police
station,
say
to
his
client,
“now
you
go
and
cooperate
with
the
district
attorney."
every
one
of
them
and
of
course
there
are
exceptions
but
they
only
prove
and
test
the
rules.
every
one
of
them
will
say
to
his
client,
and
how
he
will
say
it,
it
depends
only
on
whether
he's
a
purist
or
he
is
(inaudible)
or
not.
but
in
--
actually,
he
will
say
to
them
either
to
button
your
lip,
don't
talk
or
shut
up
or
anything
like
that
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
he
will
dry
up
this
fountain
of
possible
evidence.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
which
stage
your
honor?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
and
may
i
ask
what
your
honor's
experience
had
been?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
understood
you
say
your
experience.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
relatively
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
that's
relatively
right,
very
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
know
your
honor.
they
may
plead
guilty
because
their
conscience
bothers
them.
they
may
plead
guilty
because
they
have
decided
that
for
one
reason
or
another
including
perhaps
the
model
of
reasoning,
there's
better
off.
they
may
plead
guilty
because
the
district
attorney
offers
them
a
quid
pro
quo.
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
man
pleads
guilty.
but
certainly,
it
is
not
a
fact
that
they
have
been
put
in
the
possession
--
in
the
position
of
pleading
guilty
only
because
when
they
were
brought
in
the
police
station
they
had
no
counsel
and
just
give
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
they
must
give
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
then
i
misunderstood
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
believe.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
think
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
think
there's
any
contradiction
at
all
because
a
lawyer
advises
his
client
to
plea
guilty
after
he's
talked
to
the
district
attorney.
and
a
fair
district
attorney
will
say
to
him,
“now
look,
this
is
what
i
have.
i
have
this
witness
who'd
testify
to
so
and
so.
i
have
a
testament
from
your
client,
do
you
want
to
see
it?”
i
get
people
see
statements.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
now
have
in
new
york
a
statutory
provision,
section
813
(f)
of
our
code
that
if
the
district
attorney
intends
to
offer
a
confession
and
evident
on
the
trial,
he
must
give
reasonable
notice
to
the
defendant
before
the
trial
and
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
a
pretrial
hearing
as
to
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
based
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
based
on
your
experience,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
while
of
course,
there
will
always
be
exceptions,
it
is
my
honest
belief
that
a
warning
to
a
prospective
defendant
in
the
police
station
of
bringing
a
lawyer
in
the
manifold
difficulties,
practical
difficulties,
and
those
(inaudible)
and
obvious
that
this
will
dry
up
the
--
practically
the
whole
stream
of
confession.
and
i
--
it's
been
put
this
way,
if
you
want
to
equalize
the
defendant
and
the
police,
maybe
you
ought
to
do
it.
but
if
you
want
to
preserve
the
rights
of
an
individual
i
think
this
court
should
be
careful
as
to
how
it
defines
its
right
--
his
rights
so
as
not
to
prejudice
the
total
lives
of
the
total
community.
