justice
abe
fortas
mr.
flynn,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
but
you
said
that
he
was
not
--
that
miranda
was
not
told
that
he
might
remain
silent.
did
you
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
dispute
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
was
referring
to
page
4
of
your
brief
upon
which
you
said
that
officer
young
believes
that
miranda
was
told
that
he
need
not
answer
those
questions.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
possible
that
prior
to
this
so-called
“focusing”
or
let's
say
prior
to
arrest
knowing
that
those
don't
mean
the
same
thing,
that
a
citizen
has
an
obligation
to
cooperate
with
the
state,
give
the
state
information
that
he
may
have
relevant
to
the
crime,
that
upon
arrest
or
upon
this
“focusing”
that
the
state
and
the
individual
then
assume
the
position
of
adversaries
and
there
is
at
the
very
least,
a
change
in
that
relationship
between
the
individual
and
the
state
and
therefore
in
their
mutual
rights
and
responsibilities?
i
don't
know
whether
that's
what
my
brother
stewart
is
getting
at
and
perhaps
it
is
unfair
to
discuss
this
through
you.
but
if
you
have
a
comment
on
it,
i'd
like
to
hear
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nelson,
on
page
19
of
your
brief
you
assert
that
petitioner
was
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights,
specifically
including
his
right
to
remain
silent,
the
fact
that
his
statement
had
to
be
voluntary,
and
that
anything
he
did
say
could
be
used
against
him.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
the
only
basis
for
that
the
printed
legend
in
the
confession
that
he
signed?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
the
record
shows
that
he
was
advised
of
these
rights
somehow,
some
way,
in
addition
to
the
legend
on
his
confession?
that's
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
and
how?
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
let
us
assume
that
he
was
so
advised
and
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
record
is
not
clear
on
the
point.
let
us
assume
that
he
was
advised
of
his
rights.
in
your
opinion,
does
it
make
any
difference
when
he
was
advised?
that
is,
whether
he
was
advised
at
the
commencement
of
the
interrogation
or
in
the
early
stage
of
the
interrogation
or
whether
he
was
advised
only
when
he
was
ready
to
sign
the
confession,
the
written
confession?
does
that
make
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
any
difference
in
terms
of
the
issues
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
--
you
think
that
the
warning,
if
necessary,
has
to
be
given
prior
to
the
interrogation?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
do
you
believe
that
--
is
it
your
submission
to
us
that
a
warning
is
necessary
before
a
confession
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
can
be
taken
and
subsequently
introduced
in
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
tell
me
some
of
the
factors
that
would
be
relevant
in
the
absence
of
a
warning.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
--
well,
what
we
ought
to
do
is
to
devise
something
like
the
betts
and
brady
rule,
special
circumstances?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we're
not
talking
about
right
to
counsel
now.
we're
talking
about
the
warning.
when
is
the
warning
necessary?
and
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
that
if
the
warning
is
necessary,
that
should
be
held
to
be
constitutionally
necessary
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
then
the
warning
has
to
be
given
at
a
meaningful
time.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
i
proceeded
to
ask
you
to
give
us
some
benefit
of
your
views
as
to
whether
a
warning
was
necessary
and
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
each
case?
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
i'm
asking
you
--
and
then
i
asked
you
what
are
the
circumstances
of
each
case?
what
are
the
relevant
circumstances
to
look
for
in
a
particular
case?
and
how
about
this
particular
case,
is
the
psychiatric
report
to
which
you
referred,
psychiatric
report
no.
2,
a
material
variance
with
the
one
that
--
to
which
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
adversary
referred
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
if
the
betts
against
brady
test
were
applied
in
the
way
that
this
court
did
apply
it
to
--
prior
to
gideon,
i
suppose
it's
quite
arguable
that
miranda,
the
petitioner
here,
was
entitled
to
a
warning.
would
you
agree
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
even
if
we
assume
that
he
got
all
the
other
warnings,
and
putting
aside
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel,
assuming
that
the
record
does
show
that
he
got
these
warnings,
its
still
--
is
there
any
evidence?
i
have
to
ask
you
again,
does
the
record
show
that
he
got
it
at
what
you
would
call
a
meaningful
time?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nelson,
i
certainly
want
your
views
and
only
your
views,
and
i
don't
want
to
state
anything
unfairly,
but
i
want
to
--
am
i
correct
in
inferring
from
what
you
have
just
said
in
answer
to
my
questions,
that
the
state
of
arizona
does
agree
that
there
are
occasions
when
the
united
states
constitution
requires
that
a
warning
as
to
the
right
to
remain
silent
must
be
given
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
a
defend
--
to
a
person
who
is
in
custody
and
it
must
be
given
at
a
meaningful
time?
do
i
correctly
state
the
position
that
you're
presenting
to
us
here?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
you
give
a
--
you
give
defendants
access
to
the
state's
evidence
against
him
in
your
state?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
it
is
possible
to
speculate,
isn't
it,
that
the
state
has
limitations,
places
limitations
upon
its
obligation
to
cooperate
with
the
defendant,
as
witness,
the
denial
of
discovery
to
the
defendant,
discovery
of
the
evidence
that
the
state
has
against
him?
justice
abe
fortas
what?
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
the
prosecutors
that
you
know.
justice
abe
fortas
i
only
acknowledged,
the
point
i
was
calling
your
attention
is
it
--
there
are
in
our
system,
there
are
limitations
upon
the
degree
of
cooperativeness
on
both
sides.
it's
not
just
that
the
arrested
person
has
under
the
constitution,
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it
is
also
that
the
state,
when
it
assumes
an
adversary
position
even
before
that
time,
takes
advantage
of
certain
reticences,
shall
i
say
with
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
respect
to
disclosure
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
the
accused
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
we
have
established
in
this
colloquy
that
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
say
complete
is
a
little
bit
of
an
overstatement.
justice
abe
fortas
can
we
do
this
with
respect
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
can
we
do
that
with
respect
to
the
states?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
might
lay
down
such
a
rule,
some
way,
somehow,
short
of
a
constitutional
basis
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
the
federal
courts
and
leave
the
states
alone.
it's
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
difference
between
this
problem,
in
those
terms
and
the
problem
that
this
court
handled
in
gideon,
problem
of
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
in
--
yes,
in
the
terms
of
what
you
are
discussing.
in
other
words,
would
new
york
state
have
taken
the
position
that
gideon
was
wrongly
decided?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
general,
i
don't
want
to
take
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
any
more
of
your
time.
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
think
the
problem
is
whether
it's
not
too
late
in
the
day
to
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
i'm
asking
the
question,
that
is
to
say
that
once
this
court
has
made
the
rulings
that
it
has
made
in
gideon
and
escobedo,
i
wonder
if
it's
still
much
availed
to
argue
that
we
ought
to
draw
the
kind
of
line
that
you're
suggesting
here?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
gideon
there
was
no
claim
made
that
there
was
--
the
result
it
achieved
--
arrived
at
in
gideon
was
based
on
an
historical
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
it
was
based
upon
a
reinterpretation
of
the
general
constitutional
guarantees.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
we
ought
to
overrule
escobedo?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
we
should
overrule
escobedo?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
urging
that
we
overrule
escobedo.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
earle,
may
i
ask
your
help
on
precisely
that
point.
let's
suppose
that
this
conversation
which
i
--
as
i
remembered
it
took
place
in
a
police
car
going
from
point
a
to
point
b
in
which
vignera
said
something
rather
about
the
weapon.
let's
suppose
if
that
had
been
the
first
act
here
before
any
other,
the
first
statement
that
vignera
made.
in
short,
assume
with
me
that
the
police
picked
up
vignera
then
in
the
police
car
going
to
the
station.
vignera
said
that
he
did
it.
that
he
did
the
holdup
and
he
used
a
knife.
now,
would
that
be
inadmissible
because
of
the
absence
of
a
warning
or
the
absence
of
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
do
you
apply
that
to
my
example,
i'm
really
soliciting
your
help
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
because
i
think
--
i
think
this
is
the
problem
as
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas'
questions
indicated
that
this
is
a
real
problem,
problem
of
defining
of
such
a
procedure
which
is
plausible
and
advisable,
they
point
at
which
the
warning
has
to
be
given
or
counsel
provided
or
both.
so
that
the
right
--
here
you
have
a
man
who
is
taken
into
custody
by
the
police,
it's
an
arrest
in
the
sense
that
he
cannot
thereafter
leave.
the
police
have
him.
and
then
on
his
way
to
the
police
station
in
the
police,
car
he
makes
a
statement
that
is
in
effect
an
admission.
the
question
is
would
that
be
admissible
in
your
opinion
if
it
were
made
prior
to
the
warning
have
been
given
and
prior
to
the
offer
or
appointment
of
counsel
or
the
waiver
thereof.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
forgive
me,
i
don't
want
to
take
excess
amount
of
your
time
but
is
this
what
you're
saying
that
when
the
point
of
time
comes,
where
it
appears
that
the
police
have
enough
information
to
satisfy
themselves
if
a
fellow
really
did
the
act.
but
then,
the
right
to
counsel
or
the
warning
attaches
and
not
before,
is
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
that
there
are
cases
in
which
confession
is
later
found
to
be
unmerited?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
siegel,
i
suppose
it's
at
least
arguable
that
prior
to
magna
carta
and
prior
to
the
adoption
of
our
own
bill
of
rights.
most
people
who
were
convicted
were
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
nevertheless,
it
has
been
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
that
some
safeguards
are
necessary,
isn't
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
supposed
that
one
tries
to
look
at
this
philosophically
and
morally
in
terms
of
great
human
adventures
towards
some
kind
of
truly
civilized
order
that
these
great
provisions
in
the
magna
carta
and
our
own
bill
of
rights
were
designed
to
do
two
things;
one,
to
eliminate
even
the
unusual
case
of
an
unjust
prior
conviction,
and
two,
to
layout
a
standard
for
the
relationship
between
the
state
vis-à-vis
the
individual.
would
you
--
do
you
think
that
that
observation
is
justified?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
the
basic
to
this
whole
problem
that
we're
considering
however
one
may
came
out
in
a
--
in
the
terribly
difficult,
vexatious,
and
tormenting
decision
is
to
where
the
line
should
be
drawn.
however
one
may
come
out
on
that,
i
think
that
perhaps
one
has
to
consider
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
just
the
criminal
and
society.
but
it's
the
problem
of
a
--
the
relate
--
the
relationship
of
the
state
and
the
individual
in
the
large
and
the
total
philosophical
sense
viewed
in
light
of
the
history
of
mankind
whether
that
history
being
magna
carta
and
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
siegel,
i
suppose
that
even
in
a
extreme
communist
state
that
most
people
were
convicted
of
a
crime
were
really
guilty.
but
i
equally
suppose
that
you
would
join
me
in
finding
it
abhorrent
if
those
people
were
convicted
without
having
counsel
and
what
we
consider
to
be
a
fair
trial,
isn't
that
right?
so,
the
point
that
i'm
--
to
which
i
am
--
upon
which
i'm
asking
you're
comment
is
that,
perhaps
it
is
an
over
simplification
and
take
a
look
at
this
problem
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
facilitating
the
task
of
putting
people
in
jail
if
they
commit
a
crime,
isn't
that
right?
and
in
other
words,
“does
this
problem
really
affect
the
basic
relationship
of
the
individual
and
the
state,
and
it's
really
goes
beyond
the
administration
of
justice?
and
if
that's
been
the
history
of
mankind,
if
one
wanted
to
be,
say
that,
90%
--
if
police
get
a
90%
justifiable
result
where
that
ought
to
satisfy
and
going
to
be
pragmatic
and
practical
about
this
and
say
--
where
a
police
convict,
secure
the
conviction
of
--
and
in
90%
of
the
cases
it's
alright.
that's
a
very
sensible
attitude
in
one
point
of
view.
but
perhaps
it's
the
point
of
view
that's
been
rejected
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
our
history.
justice
abe
fortas
well
don't
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
that
i
what
i
referred
to
something
that
--
is
as
fundamental
as
place
‘beautiful
ideal'
but
i
completely
agree
with
you
and
that's
the
reason
that
we're
sitting
here.
the
problem
is
to
reconcile
a
good
many
objectives
and
values
that
are
not
totally
constant.
but
i
am
a
little
troubled,
i
must
say.
when
i
sit
here
and
hear
so
much
reference
to
this
problem,
as
if
it
were
merely
a
pragmatic
problem
of
convicting
people
who
did
it,
who
did
a
crime
because
there's
much
more
--
there
are
many
more
dimensions
i
suggest
to
the
problem
in
just
that
simple
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
and
certain
religious
and
moral
values.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
siegel
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
question
in
view
of
your
long
experience.
there
have
been
references
many
times
and
some
made
by
(voice
overlap)
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
--
that
lawyers
were
brought
in
at
the
--
at
an
early
stage,
pretrial
stage,
they
would
always
advise
the
person
under
--
in
custody
not
to
say
anything.
now,
there
are
instances
however,
where
lawyers
are
--
who
represent
persons
under
arrest
or
in
custody,
tell
their
clients
that
they
ought
to
plead
guilty.
is
that
--
in
your
experience,
does
that
--
does
that
occur
quite
frequently
or
do
most
of
the
people
who
plead
guilty,
that
most
of
the
people
that
plead
guilty
not
represented
by
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
guilty
pleas
are
entered
after
consultation
with
counsel.
justice
abe
fortas
and
are
guilty
pleas
rather
frequent
in
your
experience?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
let's
say
85
to
90
--
85
or
90%
of
the
instances
there
are
defendants
or
persons
under
arrest
and
their
lawyers
do
tell
them
to
plead
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
presently
in
our
experience
up
to
this
point
i
suppose
is
based
on
those
people
who
do
have
lawyers
at
that
stage.
justice
abe
fortas
at
the
investigatory
or
accusatorial
stage.
justice
abe
fortas
well
no,
i'm
--
justice
abe
fortas
no.
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
that
our
experience,
experience
of
our
legal
process
has
been
with
limited
groups
of
person
or
limited
numbers
of
persons
who
have
counsel
at
that
early
stage,
isn't
that
right?
that
is
to
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
most
people
don't
have
counsel
at
that
stage.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
so
that
--
and
that
--
and
i
suppose
it's
not
a
coincidence
between
the
number
of
people
who
plead
guilty
in
the
number
--
and
the
number
of
people
who
have
counsel
at
the
investigatorial
or
accusatorial
stage.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
understand
that.
i
wasn't
making
that
point.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wasn't
making
that
point
at
all.
i
would
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
doing
really
was
trying
to
ask
about
--
i
was
trying
to
ask
the
benefit
of
your
experience
with
respect
to
this
statement
that
most
of
the
--
so
many
people
are
now
accepting
without
any
thought
and
that
is
to
say
that
lawyers
would
practically
always
advice
their
client
not
to
say
anything.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
and
maybe
that
that
has
to
be
broken
down
in
two
parts.
one
is,
what
the
lawyer's
advice
to
the
client
is
before
the
lawyers
look
into
the
case?
the
other
is
what
is
the
lawyer's
advice
to
the
client
after
the
lawyers
looked
into
the
case?
and
to
my
mind
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
if
a
lawyer
as
he
frequently
does
on
the
basis
of
what
you
said
tells
a
client
to
plead
guilty,
what's
--
must
we
assume
therefore
--
must
we
--
how
do
we
reconcile
that
fact
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
statement
that
the
lawyer
would
always
tell
the
client
to
button
his
lip
as
you
put
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
would
it
cripple
the
law?
would
it
--
would
it
handicap
law,
materially
handicap
law
enforcement
if
the
person
who
was
under
arrest
started
talking
to
the
police
only
after
his
counsel
had
talked
to
the
state's
attorney.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
of
(voice
overlap)
your
observation?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
that
noon
of
the
day
of
the
arrest?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
say
“12
o'clock”,
what
do
you
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
in
what
state
was
that
statement
made,
general?
justice
abe
fortas
during
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
during
the
question
--
questioning
by
the
fbi?
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
the
--
what's
been
referred
to
as
the
standard
fbi
warning?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
apart
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
looking
to
the
constitution
and
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
your
theory,
what
is
the
basis
for
your
statement
that
if
a
man's
--
has
counsel
and
wants
to
consult
counsel,
he
should
be
allowed
to
do
so?
what's
the
constitutional
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
perhaps,
i
--
i'm
not
following
you
but
you
do
--
are
you
saying
that
there
is
or
is
not
a
constitutional
inhibition
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
are
you
saying
that
there
is
or
is
not
a
constitutional
inhibition
against
using
a
confession
which
is
given
after
denial
of
an
arrested
person's
request
to
see
his
lawyer?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
pass
that.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
basis
of
that
--
what
is
the
basis
of
that
constitutional
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
it
defeats
his
constitutional
privilege
to
himself
--
justice
abe
fortas
his
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
a
situation
in
which
a
man
says,
“i
want
to
see
a
lawyer,
i
haven't
got
one
but
i
want
a
lawyer.”
then
he
--
that's
denied
to
him
let's
say
in
--
let's
say,
they
interrogate
and
say
“sorry.
if
you
haven't'
got
a
lawyer,
we're
not
going
to
produce
one
for
you”.
and
then
the
arrested
person
confesses
and
the
confession
is
offered
at
his
trial
in
evidence.
now
in
that
case,
does
the
constitution
prohibit
or
seek
an
evidence
of
the
confession
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
now
why
not?
it's
a
difference
in
the
constitutional
terms.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
not?
because
in
one
case
--
the
only
difference
between
the
two
cases
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
on
the
first
case,
the
fellow
says,
“i
know
a
lawyer.”
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
second
--
second
case,
he
says,
“i
don't
know
a
lawyer
but
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him.
but
i
wanted
to
talk
to
a
lawyer.”
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
and
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
haven't
--
i
have
yet
heard
any
--
anybody
heard
that
state's
got
to
go
out
and
find
him
a
wife.
justice
abe
fortas
but
general,
in
the
case
where
a
man
has
a
lawyer
--
justice
abe
fortas
he's
a
gangster,
let's
say,
somebody,
an
organized
crime,
there
the
police
said
--
generally
as
i
understand,
they
have
lawyers,
not
the
little
fellows
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
a
case
when
organized
crime
follows
--
justice
abe
fortas
he's
got
a
lawyer.
your
position
is
that
if
he's
not
allowed
to
consult
the
said
lawyer
before
he
makes
his
incriminating
statement,
that
then
the
incriminating
statement
should
not
be
received
in
evidence
because
in
that
case
you
say
there's
psychological
pressure
on
him
and
the
statement
is
not
voluntary
and
he's
being
compelled
to
--
in
effect
to
make
statements
against
himself.
justice
abe
fortas
the
only
difference
between
that
case
and
the
case
where
--
that
i
put
to
you
is
in
the
second
case
he's
a
--
he
doesn't
have
a
lawyer
whom
he's
retained.
justice
abe
fortas
general,
is
the
warning
that
was
given
by
the
fbi
agents
in
this
case,
the
standard
fbi
warning?
justice
abe
fortas
i
should
--
i
should
very
much
appreciate
it.
justice
abe
fortas
knowing
that
and
i
should
also
very
much
appreciate
knowing
whether
there
is
any
source
available
to
us
as
to
fbi
practices.
justice
abe
fortas
this
has
been
my
understanding
that
the
fbi
does
have
a
standard
practice
as
to
warning
and
what
happens
in
warning
them
or
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
suggesting
any
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
well,
i'm
not
even
saying
whether
it's
possible
but
if,
for
example,
i
could
know
authoritatively
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
just
what
the
fbi
warning
is,
number
one.
number
two,
when
the
fbi
warning
is
given
and
what
stage.
number
three,
what
happens
in
the
event
that
counsel
is
requested
or
counsel
appears
representing
the
arrested
person.
number
four,
what
happens
in
the
event
that
counsel
is
requested
but
that
the
person
in
custody
does
not
have
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
be
very
grateful
if
there's
someway
in
which
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that,
that's
very
evident
from
the
records
that
we
have
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
fbi
does
seem
to
have
some
regularized
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
fawcett,
do
you
agree
that
--
that
would
mean
pulling
the
statement
that
somebody
else
here
has
made
that
the
issue
here
should
be
considered
to
be
fifth
amendment,
and
not
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
sit
down
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
may
i
ask
you.
do
you
--
as
you
read
the
majority
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court,
do
you
think
that
the
court
felt
that
--
do
you
think
that
the
court
felt
that
the
result
which
they
have
reached
in
this
case
whereas
compelled
by
this
court's
decision
in
escobedo
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
understand
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
i'm
still
asking
you
whether
you
feel
that
as
you
read
the
case,
whether
you
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
felt
that
the
result
in
the
present
case
was
compelled
by
this
court's
decision
in
escobedo
or
alternatively
whether
the
california
supreme
court
may
have
felt
that
this
was
an
appropriate,
desirable
application
of
escobedo
in
its
judgment.
that
will
make
the
distinction
clear
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
wouldn't
go
quite
that
far
with
you
but
i
understand
you.
justice
abe
fortas
i
hope
you'll
forgive
me
for
interrupting
the
order
of
your
argument,
but
i'd
like
to
give
fact
to
what
you
were
talking
about
a
few
moments
ago
and
let
me
try
to
state
to
you
what's
going
through
my
mind
now
on
the
basis
of
what
deputy
attorney
general
said
and
i'm
going
to
use
different
language.
it
seemed
to
me
that
perhaps
voir
dire
was
assigned
and
as
translated
in
the
escobedo
terms
is
that
the
investigation,
the
interrogation
should
not
be
considered
to
focus
on
the
suspect
until
a
point
well
beyond
the
arrest,
did
i
make
myself
clear
to
this
point?
justice
abe
fortas
now
yesterday
or
the
day
before,
the
counsel
read
from
the
prosecutor's
office
in
kings
county,
new
york.
as
i
remember,
i
suggested
that
the
accusatorial
stage
begins
not
upon
arrest
but
when
the
police
have
a
prima
facie
case.
i
made
a
note
of
it
and
i
think
that
is
what
he
said
and
there's
another
suggestion
that
the
--
perhaps
the
right
to
counsel
in
escobedo
terms,
that
is
to
say
one
of
this
focus
--
focuses
arises
at
some
point
after
the
arrest,
but
let
us
say
before
the
formal
accusation
of
the
indictment
or
what
not.
and
in
view
of
that,
what
would
you
say?
does
the
distinction
between
this
case
in
escobedo
turned
solely
on
the
request
that
was
made
in
escobedo
and
the
lack
of
a
request
here.
in
other
words,
is
there
any
difference
in
time
as
to
the
request
when
the
request
has
to
be
made
in
one
case
rather
than
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
if
the
test
should
be
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
at
a
time
when
demonstrably
the
police
are
out
--
the
police
are
out
to
establish
a
case
against
the
individual
and
something
beyond
just
probable
cause.
that
even
if
that
--
if
that
should
be
a
test,
it's
your
submission
that
the
facts
in
this
case
would
fall
within
the
limits
of
that
test
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
norris,
excuse
me
again
but
as
justice
stewart
said
you
did
not
espouse
a
totality
of
circumstances
rule.
i'm
not
quite
clear
yet
as
to
what
the
--
what
you
consider
to
be
the
right
rule?
whether
you
do
or
do
not
regard
a
totality
of
circumstances
rule
is
appropriate.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
--
what
rule
would
you
urge
on
us?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
don't
have
that
problem
in
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
none
of
the
self
incrimination
provisions
then
successfully
invoked
and
i
think
sustain
my
decisions
of
this
court
in
administrative
proceedings?
justice
abe
fortas
congressional
hearings
and
all
kinds
of
things
like
criminal
prosecutions
so
you
don't
have
that
problem
if
you
approach
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
norris,
that's
exactly
where
i'm
having
little
difficulty
in
understanding
your
position
and
it
maybe
that
i
am
responsible
for
interrupting
you
so
often.
but
as
i
stand
as
to
this
point
what
you
have
said,
you
do
not
believe
that
the
state's
obliged
to
furnish
counsel
immediately
upon
the
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
believe
that
if
after
an
arrest,
the
police
begin
an
interrogation.
but
then
at
that
stage,
in
order
for
the
statements
of
the
person
in
custody
to
be
admissible,
he
asked
to
be
furnished
with
the
counsel.
justice
abe
fortas
in
every
case
--
but
now
you
told
us
just
a
second
ago
that
if
the
--
is
valid,
if
the
person
in
custody
volunteers
and
then
that's
admissible
even
if
he
doesn't
have
counsel.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
you're
going
to
have
to
help
me
a
little
more.
suppose
the
man
is
arrested.
he's
not
furnished
with
counsel.
then
the
police
said
something
to
him
along
these
lines,
they
say,
“well,
did
you
do
it?”
and
he
says,
“yes,
i
did.”
nothing
more
happens
than
that
except
that
he
is
in
custody.
now
by
giving
you
that
sort
of
simple
illustration,
i'd
like
to
see
if
i
can
clarify
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
was
before
arrest,
but
take
the
same
thing
after
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
--
suppose
he
had
not
telephoned
then
and
then
not
in
fact
confessed
at
that
time.
suppose
they'd
picked
him
up
on
the
in
front
of
the
house
or
the
place
where
the
crime
was
committed,
put
him
in
the
police
car
and
then
he
had
just
volunteered
these
statements?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
police
picked
him
up,
put
him
in
the
police
car
and
then
said,
“did
you
do
it,
joe?”
and
then
he
said,
yes.
how
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
trying
to
get
you
to
answer
the
questions
for
that
purpose.
i
am
trying
to
get
as
specifically
as
i
can
for
my
own
benefit
that
what
your
position
is.
justice
abe
fortas
unhappily
we
have
the
hard
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
you
are
sort
of
a
totality
of
circumstances
man
or
sort
of
a
sub-totality
of
sub-circumstances.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ringer
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
point
prior
to
the
signature
of
the
written
confession
at
which
you
think
the
right
to
counsel
would
attest.
justice
abe
fortas
well
in
this
case
generally.
justice
abe
fortas
you
got
to
say
in
this
case
but
it
didn't
--
what
are
your
general
observations?
justice
abe
fortas
well
is
there
a
point
prior
to
the
signature
of
the
written
confession
in
which
your
warning
should
be
given?
i'm
talking
about
all
of
this
of
course
as
bearing
upon
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
justice
abe
fortas
voluntariness
of
what?
justice
abe
fortas
in
short,
what
i'd
like
to
do
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
your
help.
i'm
trying
to
refine
these
concepts
a
bit.
the
statements
are
voluntary
let
us
assume
or
not
involuntary
let
us
assume
in
the
sense
that
the
arrested
person
was
not
beaten
and
he
was
not
mistreated
or
subject
to
any
psychological
torture
--
justice
abe
fortas
-–
at
all,
but
he
was
there
and
he
was
being
interrogated
and
he
did
not
have
counsel
--
justice
abe
fortas
now
is
it
your
position
that
only
if
involuntariness
of
the
confession
in
the
sense
that
there
be
there
psychological
or
physical
maltreatment
that
that's
the
only
kind
of
--
that
those
are
the
only
circumstances
that
would
make
a
confession
involuntary
for
the
relevant
purposes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this.
in
your
view
is
the
totality
of
circumstances
merely
a
new
way
or
a
special
way
of
saying
the
--
of
asserting
the
coerced
confession
rule?
in
other
words
when
you
say
that
the
rule
ought
to
be
totality
of
circumstances,
are
you
saying
anything
more
than
that
a
confession
ought
to
be
admitted
unless
it
is
a
coerced
confession
in
the
traditional
sense.
do
we
get
anywhere
by
saying
totality
of
circumstances
--
justice
abe
fortas
since
we've
already
submitted
to
the
old
coerced
confession
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
i'm
a
bit
afraid
that
what
we're
--
the
issue
as
personally
drawn
it
seems
to
me
maybe
one
between
the
exclusion
of
admissions
on
the
ground
of
physical
or
psychological
pressure
punishment
in
the
traditional
sense.
or
the
asserted
presence
of
pressure
or
force,
you
know,
whatever
one
might
want
to
call
it
which
flows
from
the
very
fact
of
the
arrest,
in
the
absence
of
counsel
and
i'm
afraid
that
perhaps
that
--
perhaps
when
you
say
the
rule
ought
to
be
a
totality
of
circumstances
rule
than
advances
much
beyond
a
fact
that
it
is
a
reassertion
of
the
traditional
coerced
question
rule.
justice
abe
fortas
now
well
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
clarify
my
own
mind
with
your
help
whether
the
issue
really
may
not
be
one
of
the
--
except
the
pre
escobedo
rule
in
the
cases
where
there's
no
specific
request
for
counsel
or
whether
escobedo
has
some
implications
that
carry
the
problem
beyond
the
pre-escobedo
rule
of
coerced
confessions.
