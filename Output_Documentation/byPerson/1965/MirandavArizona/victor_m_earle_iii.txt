mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
another
confession
case
arising
out
of
a
conviction
of
first
degree
robbery
after
a
trial
to
a
judgment
of
the
jury
in
brooklyn,
new
york.
the
petitioner,
michael
vignera,
was
sentenced
30
to
60
years.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
without
opinion
in
the
appellate
courts
of
new
york.
briefly
the
facts
are
these,
sometime
during
the
morning
of
october
14th,
1960,
vignera
was
arrested
in
manhattan
after
having
been
singled
out
by
a
confederate.
the
confederate
had
been
arrested
earlier
that
same
morning
for
attempting
to
use
a
stolen
credit
card
registered
in
the
name
of
one
harry
adelman.
vignera
was
first
taken
to
manhattan
police
station
and
then
transferred
to
another
manhattan
police
station
for
questioning.
at
the
second
police
station
later
that
same
morning,
he
was
identified
as
the
man
who
had
robbed
a
brooklyn
dress
shop
a
few
days
before.
identification
was
made
by
the
victim,
harry,
the
same
harry
adelman,
and
an
eyewitness.
then
under
police
questioning,
vignera
admitted
having
committed
the
holdup
by
means
of
a
toy
gun
having
obtained
$93.00.
sometime
thereafter
at
about
3
p.m.,
he
was
formally
arrested.
later
that
day
he
was
taken
to
a
brooklyn
police
station
for
detention.
at
the
brooklyn
police
station
at
about
11
p.m.,
vignera's
deposition
was
taken
by
an
assistant
district
attorney
and
a
hearing
reporter
and
that
recorded
confession
was
introduced
to
the
subsequent
trial.
it
amplified
the
earlier
admission
given
to
the
police
officer,
included
such
additional
details
as
the
time
of
the
day
of
the
robbery,
the
fact
that
vignera
was
operating
alone,
the
weapon
was
concealed,
number
of
persons
in
the
dress
shop,
lack
of
preplanning,
and
the
like.
the
next
day
on
the
way
to
court,
vignera
was
again
questioned
about
the
weapon.
apparently
his
story
didn't
jive
with
that
of
the
victim
and
he
finally
admitted
in
a
--
in
fact
a
knife
rather
than
a
toy
gun
had
been
used.
and
it
is
conceded,
although
the
record
admittedly
is
silent,
it
is
conceded
that
at
no
time
was
vignera
ever
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
or
to
silence.
for
example,
the
confession
which
are
--
purports
to
be
a
verbatim
transcript
has
no
recital
of
any
kind
as
to
a
warning.
it
was
not
the
practice
in
new
york
to
give
such
a
warning
at
the
time.
i
think
it's
entirely
fair
to
assume
that
no
such
warning
was
given.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
i
--
you
asked
that
yesterday
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
my
position
is
crystal
clear.
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
the
moment
the
state
proceeded
against
him
and
the
moment
that
--
when
that
moment
arose
it
was
at
no
earlier
or
no
later
rather
than
3
p.m.
on
the
day
the
police
formerly
arrested
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
court
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
gideon
decided
that
question.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
not
necessarily.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
don't
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
the
--
gideon
holds
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
he
has
to
affirmatively
waive
it.
that's
--
it's
absolutely
correct.
and
he
has
to
begin
to
waive
it
by
the
police
making
a
showing
of
waiver.
the
burden
is
on
them
to
show
a
waiver.
but
in
escobedo,
the
court
said
in
its
footnote
that
the
right
to
silence
and
the
right
to
counsel
can
be
waived.
and
i
accept
that
as
the
majority
of
the
court.
now,
the
beginning
i
would
think
that
the
constitution
doesn't
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
require
a
warning.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
the
police
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
would
suggest
this
is
a
remedy
to
the
police.
if
they
have
some
other
remedy,
fine.
but
i
would
think
the
beginning
would
be
to
warn
him
of
his
right
in
a
very
meaningful
way,
perhaps
to
record
the
warning
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
that
would
certainly
be
an
easy
way
of
handling
it
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
your
honor,
again
because
of
the
point
--
the
waiver
point.
they
obviously
don't
want
to
assign
counsel.
the
police
aren't
very
well
equipped
to
do
it
and
they
have
to
give
him
a
--
they
have
to
--
they
will
want
--
undoubtedly
to
try
him
to
waive.
now,
if
they
can
do
that,
i
say
the
constitution
at
least
to
this
point,
history
doesn't
require
anymore.
although,
i
should
add
that
even
if
they
get
a
waiver,
we
have
to
look
rather
suspiciously
of
that
kind
of
a
waiver
and
it
wouldn't
entitle
the
police
to
hold
him
in
custody
indefinitely
even
after
such
a
waiver.
it'd
be
a
very
limited
waiver
concept
in
a
sense
of
a
principle
comparable
to
mcnabb
and
mallory.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
don't
think
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
i
--
i'm
not
so
sure
about
even
spontaneous
statements,
once
the
accusatory
stage
has
been
reached,
mr.
justice
black.
but
i
do
think
that
if
they
locked
him
up
and
didn't
get
near
him,
didn't
use
him
in
a
discovery
sense,
as
the
device
to
participate
in
his
own
subsequent
conviction,
that
he
would
not
have
to
--
a
lawyer
would
not
have
to
come
to
the
police
station
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
because
he
has
to
be
prejudiced.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
he
might
--
it
would
probably
be
very
helpful
for
him
to
--
should
lawyer
could
investigate
the
case
along
with
the
police.
but
in
terms
of
criticalness,
you
were
talking
about
a
moment
ago,
he
has
to
be
prejudiced
at
the
trial.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
critical
if
nothing
has
happened.
once
they
start
a
process
that
tends
to
undermine
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
it
is
certainly
very
critical.
and
i
might
say
that
it's
imperfectly
clear
from
what
general
taylor
said
yesterday
in
some
of
the
other
arguments
that
many
of
the
briefs
want
you
to
overrule
escobedo
or
--
and
they
are
taxed,
i
think
it
had
been
very
thinly-veiled.
i'm
going
to
assume
that
escobedo
represents
the
law
in
this
court
and
in
this
country.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
which
part
they
want
to
have
overruled?
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
the
majority
opinions
entirely,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
if
you
mean
by
rhetoric
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
several
references
to
the
sixth
amendment,
i
think
they're
part
of
the
holding
and
when
the
solicitor
general's
brief
talks
only
about
the
fifth
amendment,
i'm
only
perplexed.
i
read
what
i
read
and
that
reference
is
--
is
in
there
several
times
that
there's
a
right
to
counsel
and
a
critical
stage
can
occur
prior
to
arraignment
and
prior
to
trial.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
mr.
justice
fortas,
you
asked
a
question
like
that
yesterday.
i
think
the
question
of
--
this
focus
and
arrest
come
at
the
same
time.
i
think
that
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
the
statement
might
well
be
admissible.
certainly,
a
laying
on
of
hand
is
an
arrest
but
the
probable
cause
requirements
and
there
was
i
think
probable
cause
satisfied
here
because
he'd
been
singled
out
by
a
confederate.
the
probable
cause
requirements
are
probably
not
the
same.
if
the
determination
of
the
state
has
charged
him
and
has
began
its
proceeding
against
him.
i
can
see
--
of
examples,
for
example,
and
the
police
have
to
make
on-the-spot
judgments
taking
four
or
five
people
who
may
have
been
involved
in
a
crime,
before
they
exculpate
themselves
and
they're
sent
home
and
the
fifth
was
proceeded
against,
maybe
he's
picked
out
of
the
lineup
by
the
eyewitness.
at
that
point,
it
becomes
clear
that
the
accusatory
proceeding
has
begun
and
then
he'll
have
to
be
--
well
then
the
police
are
going
to
have
to
show
a
waiver.
any
statement
after
that
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver
or
in
the
absence
of
counsel
will
be
inadmissible.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
your
example
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
in
the
absence
of
any
form
of
coercion
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
it
would
be
admissible.
i'd
like
to
give
you
a
different
hypothetical
or
to
show
you
--
i
think
in
my
judgment
this
thing
would
vary.
for
example,
even
before
arrest,
the
accusatory
stage
might
come
into
being
if
--
in
a
situation
government
agents
had
a
man
on
surveillance,
and
saw
him
commit
some
very
speck
acts
and
then
laid
their
hands
on
him.
i
think
there,
it
would
perfectly
clear
they
were
proceeding
against
him
and
you'd
moved
to
stay
even
further
back.
but
in
a
more
typical
situation
as
in
vignera's,
i
think
the
accusatory
stage
doesn't
begin
until
sometime
after
hands
had
been
laid
on
and
he
come
to
the
police
station.
here
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
it
may
have
been
after
he
was
identified.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
although,
we
don't
have
to
look
into
the
minds
of
the
police
necessarily,
but
you'll
be
able
to
determine
that.
you
should
be
able
to
determine
that.
and
if
you're
in
doubt,
i
think
some
people
will
say,
“well,
how
did
the
policeman
know
this?”
if
they're
in
doubt
give
the
warning,
push
it
up,
err
on
the
side
of
the
warning,
but
that's
why
i
don't
see
why
it
should
post
so
much
of
a
problem.
i
think
the
fbi
agents
who've
been
giving
this
warning
for
so
many
years,
probably
err
on
that
side.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
there
--
the
chief
of
police
in
the
district
of
columbia
last
august
promulgated
a
warning
which
i
understand
is
now
being
given
by
all
police
agents
in
the
--
police
official
in
the
district.
it
goes
something
like
this,
“you
have
been
placed
under
arrest.
you
are
not
required
to
say
anything
to
us
at
any
time
or
to
answer
any
questions.
anything
you
say
may
be
used
as
evidence
in
court.
you
may
call
a
lawyer
or
a
relative
or
a
friend.
your
lawyer
may
be
present
here
and
you
may
talk
with
him,
if
you
cannot
obtain
a
lawyer
one
maybe
appointed
before
you
when
you
first
go
to
court.”
i
may
have
a
little
bit
of
quibble
about
that
third
point
because
it
suggests
a
little
bit
that
you
might
not
be
able
to
get
a
lawyer
now
if
you
want
one.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
no.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
--
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
he
does
not
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
unless
he
waives
it.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
and
then
the
question
might
come
up
of
how
the
police
--
what
did
the
police
do
when
the
fellow
says,
“well,
thanks,
i'd
like
a
lawyer
as
a
matter
of
fact
now
that
you
mentioned
it.”
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
“but
i
don't
have
any
money.”
they
have
a
very
simple
choice.
they
can
give
him
10
cents
and
a
phone
number
of
a
legal
aid
society
or
public
defender.
and
if
that
bothers
him,
if
they're
unwilling
or
unable
to
do
that,
they
have
another
alternative
just
stop
interrogating
him.
that
alternative
was
never
mentioned
by
anybody.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
when
i've
read
--
with
what
i've
read,
i'm
satisfied
with
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
it's
enough
that
it's
made
to
an
adult
who
is
not
a
moron
or
who
has
a
(inaudible),
i
think
that's
probably
enough.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
no,
it's
not
correct.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
let
me
do
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
didn't
write
this
warning
here
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
would
be
happy
with
the
first
two
sections
of
them.
one
is,
“you've
placed
under
arrest,
you
are
not
required
to
say
anything
to
us
at
any
time
or
to
answer
any
questions.
anything
you
say
may
be
used
as
evidence
in
court.”
two,
“you
may
call
a
lawyer
or
a
relative
or
a
friend.
your
lawyer
may
be
present
here
and
you
may
talk
with
him.”
and
they've
got
a
three
and
i
just
wouldn't
add.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i'd
stop
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
absolutely
nothing?
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
it
takes
a
conscious
reli
--
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
for
him
to
waive
his
rights.
those
two
basic
rights
i've
been
talking
about,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
we
can
believe
that
he
nodded
his
head,
it's
possible
that
he
waived.
i'd
be
very
reluctant
to
come
to
that
conclusion
on
that
hypothetical
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
if
the
warning
is
recorded
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
if
he
write
--
if
he
writes
down
his
own
handwriting
that,
“i've
been
warned,
i
understand
that
i
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer
now,
to
talk
to
him
right
at
this
minute
if
i
want
to
or
i
have
the
right
to
say
nothing
if
i
want
to,
i
understand
that.
but
i
--
i
would
like
to
go
ahead
and
cooperate
with
the
police”
signed
michael
vignera,
that
would
be
another
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
that's
what
the
police
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
have
to
say.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
oh,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
it
should
definitely
be
recorded
in
some
way.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
absolutely.
and
it
shouldn't
be
something
that
he's
conned
in
to
give
him.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
beginning.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
not
--
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me
--
for
me
to
read
the
kind
of
warning
that
would
satisfy
me.
those
are
the
words
that
i
think
make
some
sense.
but
it's
got
to
be
made
meaningful
to
him
and
he's
got
to
acquiesce
them.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
without
his
lawyer
being
present,
for
example?
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
i
take
it,
that
that
would
be
a
decision
made
by
his
lawyer
and
lawyers
can
waive
rights
for
their
clients.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
it's
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
it's
a
waiver
--
it's
a
waiver
of
a
right
to
have
law
--
a
lawyer
in
all
the
sense.
that
is
always
meant.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
and
the
lawyer
can
make
a
determination
whether
he
wants
to
be
present
or
not.
lawyers
have
waived
many
rights
including
cases
that
come
to
this
court.
not
filing
on
the
30th
day
and
notice
of
appeal
and
the
like,
and
if
he
makes
a
decision
to
let
the
--
to
throw
him
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
that
is
right
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
just
for
example
within
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
is
in
the
--
alright,
but
i
want
to
elaborate
on
that
if
i
might.
in
a
deposition
in
a
civil
case
for
example,
customarily
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
would
have
counsel
present
but
i
could
certainly
conceive
of
one
lawyer
deciding
not
to
be
present.
and
through
--
by
his
client
through
him
would
thereby
waive
that
right.
but
it
seems
the
only
way
you
could
distinguish
this
case
from
escobedo
is
the
fact
that
vignera
did
not
make
a
request
and
--
we've
even
talking
about
with
respect
to
waiver,
i
think,
governs
that.
obviously,
it
wasn't
a
request
that
makes
the
right
attached.
the
right
attaches
when
the
state
proceeds
criminally
against
the
individual.
the
significance
of
the
request,
i
think
in
escobedo
was
that,
was
an
objective
piece
of
evidence
to
show
that
that
stage
have
been
reached
there.
actually,
it's
even
clearer
in
vignera,
that
in
this
case
that
at
least
by
3
p.m.,
the
stage
was
clearly
reached.
as
an
independent
ground
to
support
reversal
on
this
case,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
vignera
was
detained
for
an
unnecessary
period
of
time.
i
think
that's
true
both
under
the
state
law
and
as
a
matter
of
common
reasoning.
he
was
--
even
after
the
accusatory
stage
is
clearly
reached
to
the
police
who
had
formerly
charged
him,
he
was
not
--
been
arraigned.
he
was
not
arraigned
for
nearly
another
18
hours.
and
i
think
the
point
you
raised
yesterday
mr.
justice
black
doesn't
--
that
detention,
and
i
would
add
especially
prolonged
detention,
does
not
cut
down
on
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
doesn't
whittle
it
away,
doesn't
undermine
it
necessarily.
and
i
would
say
that
it
certainly
does.
as
i
said
earlier
i
think
that
--
i
hope
that
principle
of
the
court
adapts
this
one
which
combines
warning
with
a
rule
at
least
analogous
to
the
guidelines
set
down
by
mcnabb
and
mallory.
but
even
if
there
is
a
waiver,
a
man
can't
be
detained
indefinitely.
of
course,
in
my
case
there
wasn't
even
a
waiver.
and
there
was
this
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
they're
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
they're
entitled
to
waive
in
other
situations.
i
--
it's
true
in
court
when
they
want
to
plead
guilty
for
example
if
the
judge
will
--
will
decline
assignment
of
counsel,
the
judge
will
typically
interrogate
him
at
some
length
as
you
realized
there's
a
significance
of
his
act.
and
that
is
a
lot
more
visible
situation
and
more
conducive
to
--
or
being
receptive
to
the
idea
of
a
waiver
--
a
waiver
in
the
police
station.
i
agree
that
--
that's
probably
the
worst
place
you
can
--
the
party
alleging
waiver
has
control
over
the
party
alleged
to
have
waived.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
wouldn't
be
terribly
unhappy
with
having
lawyers
in
the
police
station
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'd
be
grateful
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
it
doesn't
follow
naturally
because
the
majority
of
the
court
in
escobedo
said
these
rights
can
be
waived.
now,
i
think
we
have
--
we
do
have
to
recognize
some
of
the
realities
of
law
enforcement.
they
do
have
to
investigate,
they
do
have
the
hurly-burly
of
crimes
that
are
being
committed
by
the
minute,
and
they
do
have
to
operate
out
of
the
police
station.
i
think
we're
dealing
with
adults,
if
we
use
tape
recordings,
if
we
--
the
police
go
to
great
lengths
and
indeed
do
it
with
a
professional
spirit.
well,
the
spirit
not
of
antagonism
but
the
spirit
of
recognizing
that
they
are
inevitably
in
an
adversary
situation
and
the
man
they're
dealing
with
has
rights
and
they
want
to
protect
their
conviction.
they
want
to
make
sure
they
can
go
to
conviction.
they
don't
throw
it
out
by
some
careless
error.
and
i
might
say
this,
this
is
a
good
example,
this
case
of
where
the
constable
certainly
didn't
blunder.
here
at
midnight
after
all
these
hours
of
detention,
a
member
of
the
bar
marches
in
with
his
stenographer.
i
mean,
it
certainly
was
deliberate.
there's
much
talk
in
the
briefs,
in
the
sg's
brief
about
the
exigencies
of
the
moment,
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
weren't
bothering
the
assistant
district
attorney.
he
was
just
oprating
at
his
convenience
at
11
p.m.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
in
no
sense
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
don't
think
it
was
coerced
at
all.
but
i'd
like
to
say
--
mr.
justice
white
asked
yesterday,
a
question
about
compelling
someone
to
give
up
his
fifth
amendment
rights,
his
privilege,
and
i
think
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
that
and
coercing
a
confession.
it
wasn't
until
1964
that
the
--
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
applied
to
the
states.
and
so
the
court
inevitably
all
through
the
--
until
the
‘60s
really,
state
convictions
are
overturned
only
by
looking
to
the
generality
of
--
the
totality
of
circumstances
under
the
due
process
clause.
now,
we
have
specific
constitutional
guarantee
that
are
applied
in
root
and
branch
to
the
states,
both
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
amendment
rights.
and
the
--
it's
true
that
the
word
compel
is
used
in
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
the
privilege.
it's
quite
different
to
say
that
the
privilege
is
cut
down
or
impaired
by
detention
and
that
a
man's
will
has
been
so
overborne
that
a
confession
is
enforced
from
him.
and
i
must
say,
i
was
a
little
perplexed
to
read
the
solicitor
general's
brief
when
they
talked
about
--
the
principle,
they
would
have
the
court
adapt
is
basically
a
brahm
principle
relating
to
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
they
support
that
with
citations,
the
coerced
confession
cases
talking
about
having
one's
will
overborne
and
going
back
to
the
totality
of
circumstances.
the
trouble
with
totality
of
circumstances
in
this
field
and
that
would
get
us
back
to
betts
and
brady
mr.
justice
fortas
that
you
mentioned
yesterday.
betts
against
brady
was
--
was
not
a
right
to
counsel
decision,
it
was
a
due
process
decision.
i
hate
to
sound
too
cynical
but
if
we
go
back
to
the
totality
of
circumstances,
that
means
that
this
court
will
sit
all
by
itself
as
it
has
so
many
years
to
overturn
a
few
confession
cases
that
it
can
take
necessarily
by
the
bulk
of
its
work.
and
the
lower
courts
won't
do
their
job.
we
need
some
specific
guidelines
just
as
escobedo
to
help
them
along
the
way.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
you
can't
decide
every
case
in
advance
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
think
it's
that
hard
to
tell
for
lawyers
certainly
or
for
their
trained
agents
to
know
when
they
made
up
their
minds
to
charge
someone.
the
english,
it
seems,
they
have
no
trouble
with
it.
in
fact
the
new
york
police
for
years
have
had
fiction
of
saying,
"i
arrested
him
in
such
and
such
a
time,
that
time
being
long
after
he
was
taken
into
custody."
what
they
meant
was,
i
made
up
my
mind
at
that
point
to
charge
him.
so,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
they
make
up
their
minds
and
give
him
a
warning.
i
can't
understand
all
the
‘fuss
and
feathers'
is
about.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
it's
true.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
true.
as
judge
friendly
said,
"we're
talking
about
something
here
that
is
short
of
any
defined
legal
stages”
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
and
i
agree
if
that
is
so.
but,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
there's
no
claim
of
coercion
your
honor.
i
certainly
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
i
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
no,
it
was
not
free
of
that
sir.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
because
he
was
on
official
custody
and
questions
are
being
asked
of
him
by
official
notice.
the
question
suggests
the
right
to
receive
answers.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
mean
that
it
was
not
coerced
in
the
context
of
the
coercing
--
confession
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
until
now.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
it
does
mean
that,
that's
right.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
we
should.
i
think
you
should.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
he
certainly
did
in
a
fifth
amendment
sense.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
right
your
honor.
all
i'm
--
all
--
i
was
merely
making
a
distinction
between
that
and
the
coercion
cases.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
yes,
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
right.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
and
look
--
it
looked
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
correct.
but
those
cases
also
looked
to
the
subjective
mind
and
volition
of
the
accused
and
i
say
that's
irrelevant
in
a
fifth
amendment
sense.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
right.
i
think
a
voluntary
statement
is
out
if
it
comes
after
the
accusatory
stage.
no,
question
about
it.
on
the
other
hand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver,
we
would
be
very
close
to
that
except
that
prior
to
the
accusatory
stage,
the
police
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
screen,
put
people
on
lineups
presumably,
and
even
ask
questions
on
the
way
down
to
the
police
station.
they
do
have
a
duty
to
investigate
crime
and
that's
certainly
a
duty
we
have
to
recognize.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
i
don't
mean
to
employ
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
detention
particularly
prolonged
in
a
police
station
is
inherently
compulsive.
and
there's
no
question,
but
the
corollary
that
that
right
lawyer
should
be
able
to
protect,
if
he
gets
the
chance,
is
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
that
was
the
chance
that
never
arose
here.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
think
as
a
matter
of
logic,
he
is.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well
i'm
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
as
an
advocate,
i'm
constrained
to
be
bound
by
this
--
opinions
of
this
court
mr.
justice
black
and
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
with
no
coerced
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
no
decision
has
gone
that
far.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
i'll
answer
your
question
specifically,
i
think
that
the
privilege
only
comes
into
play
once
the
accusatory
stage
has
been
reached.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
the
accusatory
stage
has
been
reached.
so
15
minutes
might
not
be
enough
in
a
given
case
or
it
might
depending
in
the
facts.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
no,
i
don't.
i
get
back
to
escobedo
v.
illinois.
i'm
perfectly
happy
with
that
decision.
the
reason
for
that
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
that's
the
last
thing
that
i
want
as
i
try
to
say
earlier.
i
think
that
the
stage
is
going
to
come
earlier
than
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
it
certainly
is.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
it
certainly
is.
but
you
see
my
problem
is
this,
the
police
have
to
investigate
crime
and
they
have
to
talk
to
suspects.
and
i
think
when
they
talk
to
a
suspect
his
right
to
silence
is
--
may
very
well
be
impaired.
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
critical
or
that
they
are
--
should
be
debarred
from
doing
that
until
--
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
--
they
proceeded
against
us.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
well,
i
--
there
certainly
is
and
if
the
court
--
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
in
every
case,
the
accusatory
stage
once
arises,
once
the
man
is
taken
by
--
into
custody,
i
would
say,
hurray.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
i
would
be
perfectly
happy
with
that.
mr.
victor
m.
earle,
iii
that's
right.
he's
the
defendant
and
i'm
--
and
i
--
if
that's
the
time
it
should
be,
if
that's
--
it's
certainly
fine
with
me.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
--
that
really
is
my
point,
it's
the
premise
we
begin
with.
the
--
many
brace
begin
with
the
premise
--
there's
a
need
for
police
questioning.
there
certainly
is
that
need
but
the
premise
we
begin
with
is
that
the
constitution
recognizes
when
the
man
has
proceeded
against
and
at
that
time,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
police.
