justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
if
the
--
that
there's
no
question
that
he
was
not
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
“of
that
kind”?
was
he
--
was
it
voluntary
or
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
claim
this
fifth
amendment
rights
were
violated?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
was
compelled
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
the
amendment
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
the
fifth
--
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
the
fifth
said,
you
say
he
was
compelled
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
i'm
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
talking
about
violating
the
amendment,
namely
the
term,
this
provision
that
he
was
--
to
violate
the
amendment
is
--
the
fifth
amendment
right,
he
has
to
be
compelled
to
do
it,
doesn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
was
talking
what
the
constitution
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
he
does.
so
he
was
compelled
to
do
it,
wasn't
he,
according
to
your
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
all
the
circumstances
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
if
he
claimed
his
fifth
amendment
rights
were
being
violated.
and
if
they
were,
he
must
be
compelled
--
you
say,
compelled
to
do
it
under
all
the
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
happens,
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
fellow
says
nothing
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
--
they
give
him
the
warning
and
he
nods
his
head,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hear
you.
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it?
well,
i
understand
--
i
thought
that's
what
you
would
say.
now,
what
happens
then?
the
fellow
says
--
he
just
nods
his
head,
what
if
he
just
looks
at
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
it
--
what
is
the
--
what
besides
giving
the
warning
and
the
failure
to
request
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
--
would
it
require
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
--
why
would
that
warning,
that's
just
fair
at
the
first
stage
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
you,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
true.
the
police
have
to
say
that
but
if
they
wanted
--
if
they
want
to
rely
on
a
waiver
at
anytime,
they
want
to
rely
on
a
waiver
at
anytime
which
is
the
only
ground
that
you
would
accept
for
a
lawyer
not
being
present
is
a
written
waiver,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
they
could
have
--
there
should
be
a
written
waiver
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
the
end
it
just
the
giving
of
--
the
giving
of
the
warning
is
only
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
minor
first
step.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
--
now,
what
if
he
doesn't
waive
and
he
says,
“i
do
want
counsel"?
and
the
states
says,
“fine.
here's
a
dime
and
here's
a
legal
aid
number."
and
the
fellow
calls
them
and
he
talks
--
he
talks
to
the
lawyer
and
he
comes
back
and
sits
down
and
you
ask
him
some
questions
and
he
answers
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
a
waiver
in
your
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
is
it
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
consult
counsel
or
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
have
counsel
present?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
isn't
it
--
my
question
is
really
going
to,
what
do
you
think
the
scope
of
the
right
is?
you
think
the
scope
of
the
right
is
to
have
counsel
present
and
that
you
must
find
not
only
the
waiver,
the
right
to
consult
counsel,
but
the
right
to
have
counsel
present?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
arguing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
like
a
specific
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence
your
concern
is
with
the
so-called
voluntary
statement
after
the
accusatory
stage?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
a
--
in
your
own
experience
any
judgment
as
to
what
proportion
of
the
cases
that
not
that
confessions
are
used
in
or
that
not
that
confessions
are
important
evidence
in,
but
those
cases
where
without
the
confession
you
wouldn't
have
a
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short
of
it
is
that
you
have
no
--
do
you
know
of
any
reliable
statistics
on
this
now
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say,
this
is
a
sort
of
--
of
which
he
was
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
relevant
to
cover
it
or
not
the
--
the
confession
is
necessary
to
the
case,
it
may
not
be
because
the
confession
produced
are
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
11:45
the
next
day,
the
next
morning?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
if
upon
giving
such
a
warning,
the
person
being
interrogated
says,
“i
will
--
i
want
to
call
counsel”.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
if
he
says,
“i
don't
know
anyone.
i
don't
know
a
lawyer.
and
i
can't
afford
one
anyway”,
what
happens
then?
but
i
still
want
to
talk
to
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
can
the
agent
go
--
will
the
agent
then
go
on
and
interrogate?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
what
if
he
says
no.
just
says,
“no,
i
don't
want
to
talk
without
a
lawyer.”
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
interrogation
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
or
--
and
you
know
what
the
practice
is?
did
they
say,
“oh
come
on
now
and
go
on
and
asking
him
questions
and
presenting
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
they
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
if
the
--
if
the
counsel's
point
doesn't
need
to
get
into
it
at
all,
if
the
fellow
knows
enough
to
say,
“why
do
you
still
want
to
talk
without
a
lawyer
here,”
he
knows
it's
enough
to
say,
“i
just
don't
want
to
talk”.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
asked
him
the
question,
they
say,
--
they
give
him
the
warning
and
he
says,
"i
don't
know
a
lawyer.
i
can't
afford
one",
and
the
agent
says,
“well,
we
have
no
lawyers
to
furnish
you
and
do
you
want
to
talk
or
not?"
and
he
says,
"well,
i
don't."
and
the
agent
says,
"well,
you
don't
have
to
but
if
you
want
to,
we
want
to
hear
what
you
got
to
say."
and
he
then
doesn't
say,
“no,
i
don't
want
to
talk,”
he
says,
“well,
what
do
you
want
to
know?”
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he's
is
being
--
he's
talking
without
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
he
know
when
that
--
how
does
he
know
when
that
--
to
make
that
decision
on
whether
to
talk
or
not
until
a
lawyer
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
whether
a
lawyer
is
present
there
or
not,
isn't
--
is
relevant
to
what,
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
different,
that's
a
different
case.
then
it'd
be
--
they
just
say,
“well,
we
don't
have
a
lawyer
and
now
you
--
and
the
--”
justice
byron
r.
white
“but
you
don't
need
to
talk,
but
do
you
or
do
you
--
don't
you
want
to
talk
without
a
lawyer?”
then
he
says,
“well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
do
you
want
to
know?”
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
soon
as
he
says,
“i
want
a
lawyer”,
why
hasn't
he
automatically
said,
“i
don't
want
to
talk
without
one
and
therefore
the
interrogation
should
cease."
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
yet
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
solicitor
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
that
(inaudible)
he
didn't
want
a
lawyer
and
he
was
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
in
all,
practically
--
perhaps,
the
interrogation
is
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
he
just
--
you
--
you've
--
he
says
within
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
statement
there,
and
he
says,
“well,
i
want
a
lawyer”.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
presumed
to
go
ahead,
“get
him!”
“well,
i
don't
have
one.”
and
they
just
said,
“sorry,
we
can't
furnish
you
one”,
and
they
ought
to
pull
up
his
paper
--
as
i
understand
you,
the
agent
ought
to
pull
up
his
papers
and
leave.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
fellow
has
already
said
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
he
doesn't
want
to
talk
unless
he
has
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
says
i
want
to
--
all
he
says
in
answer
to
that
warning
is,
"i
want
a
lawyer."
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
then
--
if
he
doesn't
get
one,
why
shouldn't
--
why
isn't
the
conversation
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
says
--
if
he
says,
if
you're
reading
that
part
again
and
he
says
“well,
what
do
you
want
to
know?”
“i'll
ask
you
some
questions.
try
to
straighten
some
things
out.”
you
wouldn't
at
that
point
to
say
that
if
there's
anything
wrong
with
further
questioning.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
know
--
you
wouldn't
have
him
--
you
wouldn't
insist
that
they
sign
a
waiver
of
some
kind.
do
you
think
there's
anything
to
waive
anyway?
