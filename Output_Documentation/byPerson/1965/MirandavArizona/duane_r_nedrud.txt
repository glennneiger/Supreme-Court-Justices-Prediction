mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
duane
nedrud,
i'm
counsel
for
the
amicus,
national
district
attorneys
association.
my
co-counsel
is
ms.
oberto.
i
thought
that
her
presence
might
show
that
prosecuting
attorneys
are
not
all
bad
or
she
wouldn't
be
working
for
us
in
the
full
time
basis.
i
may
use
some
words
of
one
of
the
justices
of
this
supreme
court.
the
escobedo
decision
and
the
dorado
interpretation
makes
it
more
necessary
than
ever
that
we
stop
and
look
where
we
are
going.
if
we
are
talking
about
equality
between
the
rich
and
the
poor,
we
are
thriving
for
a
worthy
objective.
if
we
are
talking
about
equality
between
the
policeman
and
the
criminal,
we
are
on
dangerous
ground.
i
would
remind
this
court
that
we
are
not
talking
about
the
police
versus
the
defendant.
we
are
talking
about
the
people
versus
the
defendant
in
any
--
in
the
same
way
that
we
would
not
talk
about
the
army
or
the
marine
corps
versus
the
vietcong
but
we
would
talk
about
the
united
states
versus
the
vietcong.
i
have
not
mentioned
in
my
brief
anything
about
the
fifth
or
the
sixth
amendment.
i
concede
that
this
court
can
interpret
those
amendments
in
the
way
that
it
sees
fit.
i
am
willing
to
agree
with
the
aclu
in
their
brief
in
one
point
where
they
quote
me
although
they
do
misquote
me
when
they
refer
to
malloy
and
haynes
in
substitution
for
--
on
page
26
of
their
brief
instead
of
hailey
and
payne
whom
i
consider
entirely
different
that
in
the
admonishment
in
the
dorado
interpretation
will
not
affect
materially
confessions.
if
this
is
to
be
our
objective
to
limit
the
use
of
the
confession
in
criminal
cases
then
you
are
taking
from
the
police
the
most
important
piece
of
evidence
in
every
case
that
they
bring
before
our
court
of
justice.
police
officers
are
public
servants.
they
are
not
attempting
to
put
innocent
people
to
jail.
they
want
to
follow
the
dictates
of
this
court
and
they
will
follow
them
to
the
best
of
their
ability
but
they
too
are
human
beings.
they
do
have,
however,
an
experience
and
knowledge
which
many
of
us
lack
because
this
is
their
job
in
investigation
of
crime.
and
we
have
not,
as
lawyers,
paid
attention
to
their
problems.
we
have
seldom
bend
on
to
the
police
station
and
asked
what
can
we
do
to
assist
you
in
your
problems.
we
are
more
inclined.
and
i
talk
about
the
prosecuting
attorneys
and
i
am
not
referring
to
this
court
anymore
than
--
any
other
lawyer
in
the
united
states.
in
the
case,
if
i
may
use
the
present
case
of
miranda
as
an
example,
the
defense
admits
that
there
is
a
voluntary
confession.
he
says
that
we
should
not
allow
this
confession
because
he
did
not
have
counsel
present
because
we
would
not
have
been
able
to
convict
him
because
there
was
no
other
evidence
except
his
own
voluntary
statement
that
his
male
organ
had
penetrated
a
half
an
inch,
otherwise
he
would
have
been
acquitted.
is
this
what
we
are
looking
for
to
acquit
miranda
because
he
did
not
have
counsel?
the
amicus
here
as
presented
data
covering
thousands
of
man-hours
on
the
part
of
the
members
attempting
to
show
the
widespread
use
of
confessions.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
widespread
use
of
confessions
justifies
their
use.
i
am
just
attempting
to
present
to
you
through
our
members
the
importance
of
the
confession
in
our
criminal
administration
of
justice.
i
believe
that
there
is
something
beyond
that
which
we
are
discussing
here.
i
think
that
there
is
a
need
and
i
have
mentioned
this
and
i
pray
for
it
that
all
public
servants,
law
enforcement
officers
and
prosecuting
attorneys,
trial
courts
and
members
of
this
court
work
together.
we
are
not
adversaries.
there
is
a
need
i
think
on
the
part
of
the
people
to
be
able
to
refer
to
my
policemen,
my
--
our
police,
my
court
and
not
those
cops
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
sir?
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
if
i
knew
what
escobedo
meant,
i
may
say
so
but
i
do
--
i
have
said
in
my
brief
mr.
justice
fortas
that
i
think
that
escobedo
should
never
have
been
appealed
in
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
think
that
this
court
rightly
reversed
the
case
on
the
facts.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
no
sir.
it's
the
system
--
our
system
of
justice
in
effect
which
we
need
as
a
matter
of
change.
i
do
not
attempt
to
say
that
defense
counsel
is
wrong
when
they
attempt
to
do
the
best
they
can
for
counsel.
this
is
our
system
of
justice.
but
i
could
tell
you
for
example
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
when
a
defense
counsel
is
picked
by
those
who
are
in
the
profession
of
criminal
--
of
crime,
if
i
can
use
this,
that
they
wonder
who
is
hot
for
example
in
winning
cases
now
and
they
are
picked
almost
like
whether
--
as
if
they
were
race
horses
because
now
they
are
winning.
there
is
nothing
so
fickle
as
a
criminal
defendant.
he
wants
only
one
thing,
he
wants
to
win.
now,
if
a
prosecuting
attorney
only
wants
to
win
then
we
should
not
have
that
prosecuting
attorney
in
office.
we
should
make
a
change.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
if
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
he
does
not
waive
his
right
to
counsel,
i
think
that
he
should
have
a
lawyer,
i
think
that
even
the
state
should
have
--
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
i
think
the
state
should
appoint
him
a
lawyer
if
he
asked
for
a
lawyer.
i
do
not
think
however
that
we
should
in
effect
encourage
him
to
have
a
lawyer.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
chief
justice,
a
lawyer
must
in
our
system
of
justice,
must
attempt
to
free
the
defendant.
this
is
his
job.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
yes
sir.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
i
think
that
he
is
not
a
menace
at
the
trial
level.
he
is
not
a
menace
per
se
but
he
is
in
doing
his
duty
is
going
to
prevent
a
confession
from
being
obtained.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
chief
justice,
i
did
not
say
he
was
a
menace.
i
--
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
i
merely
said
that
he
in
effect
will
prevent
a
confession
from
being
obtained
and
if
this
is
what
we
are
looking
for
then
we
should
appoint
a
counsel
even
before
the
arrest
stage.
because
the
moment
that
a
murder
takes
place,
the
government
is
out
looking
for
the
criminal.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you
once
--
one
iota,
i
am
just
saying
that
if
in
effect
that
this
is
what
should
be
done,
if
you
want
to
equalize
for
example
the
defendant's
right
against
the
policeman,
naturally
he
should
have
counsel
if
this
is
what
we
are
striving
for.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
chief
justice,
i
of
course
do
not
interpret
the
court
to
the
constitution.
this
is
of
course
your
prerogative
sir.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
i
do
not
interpret
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
until
the
trial
starts.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
yes
sir.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
as
i
read
the
constitution,
you
asked
me
my
opinion,
i
said
i
have
no
authority
to
interpret
the
constitution.
i
am
saying
that
this
is
the
way
i
read
the
constitution.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
i
believe
so.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
yes
sir.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
chief
douglas
--
chief
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
concerned
when
the
lawyers
enter
the
stage
and
maybe
part
of
their
problem
is
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
enters
before
he
should.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
the
question
comes
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
whether
or
not
we
are
gong
to
allow
the
trial
court
to
determine
the
guilt
or
innocence
or
the
defense
counsel.
if
the
defense
counsel
comes
in
at
the
arrest
stage,
he
will
as
he
should
prevent
the
pros
--
or
prevent
the
defendant
from
confessing
to
his
crime
and
you
will
have
your
convictions.
if
this
is
what
is
wanted,
this
is
what
will
occur.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
true.
however,
again,
i
do
not
--
i
am
--
we're
talking
about
the
voluntary-involuntary
rule
and
i
have
not
questioned
this
whatsoever.
this
is
a
--
i
believe
a
good
rule.
i
have
said
that
mapp
versus
ohio
is
a
good
rule.
i
believe
however
that
there
is
a
point
of
diminishing
returns
and
at
ones
--
at
some
stage
the
police
must
be
in
a
position
to
protect
us.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
well,
again
--
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
yes
sir.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
mr.
justice
black,
again,
the
question
is,
are
we
interested
in
convicting
the
defendant
or
are
we
interested
in
protecting
or
acquitting
him?
this
is
the
point
that
--
the
only
point
that
i
can
in
effect
make.
if
you
say
that
this
defendant
needs
counsel
at
this
time,
for
example,
let
me
if
i
may
use
this
illustration.
i
worked
when
i
was
a
professor
of
law
which
i
was
prior
to
taking
this
position.
i
worked
on
the
defense
project
for
the
american
bar
association
and
in
the
questionnaire,
there
was
a
statement,
when
is
the
ideal
time
for
a
counsel
to
be
appointed
for
the
defendant?
the
question
is,
when
is
the
ideal
time
for
whom
the
people
or
the
defendant.
now,
if
it
is
for
the
defendant
then
it
is
the
earliest
possible
opportunity.
if
it
is
for
the
people,
it
should
not
be
until
a
critical
stage
if
it
is
white
versus
maryland,
i
agree
it
should
be
at
the
preliminary
hearing
stage.
if
it
is
in
the
question
of
arraignment
as
in
alabama,
i
agree.
if
it
is
a
--
at
the
trial
stage
and
he
has
lost
none
of
his
rights
as
--
which
can
be
interpreted
in
one
way
or
another
then
i
say
that
it
should
be
at
the
trial
stage.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
being
voluntary
in
the
police
station?
no.
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
well,
i
would
--
mr.
duane
r.
nedrud
i
would
hope
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
court
has
protected
as
i
referred
to
in
my
directs
and
the
page
by
an
involuntary
rule
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
i
hope
that
this
court
will
also
continue
to
invoke
this
rule
but
not
go
so
far
as
to
prevent
the
police
from
protecting
us.
