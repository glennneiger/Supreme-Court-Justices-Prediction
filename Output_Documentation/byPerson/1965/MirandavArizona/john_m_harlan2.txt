justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
you'd
to
say,
wouldn't
you?
it's
a
question
of
fact
for
somebody
to
decide
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
context
of
the
different
circumstances
that
have
risen.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
part
of
escobedo
do
you
think
represents
your
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
claim
in
this
case
that
the
admission
was
coerced?
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
it's
about
the
constitution
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
on
this
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
a
little
broader
basis?
as
i
read
your
brief,
the
government's
position
is
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right
neither
a
warning
of
counsel
nor
a
warning
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
is
a
requirement
but
that
absent
either
one
of
those
warnings,
those
are
factors
that
could
be
taken
into
account
on
judging
voluntariness
and
that
the
ultimate
constitutional
issue
in
these
cases
is
whether
or
not
the
admission
or
statement
or
confession
was
voluntary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
you're
not
receding
from
that
or
on
anything
you've
said?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
understood
you
had.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
--
suppose
you
were
in
the
court
during
this
period
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
would
you
say
that
its
proposition
before
this
court
would
go
slow
on
the
constitutional
--
these
very
wide-sweeping
investigations
of
the
(inaudible)
as
to
what
form
it
will
be
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
comment
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
third
approach?
now,
there's
(inaudible)
or
the
fifth
amendment
to
self-incrimination
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
wouldn't
be
troubled.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
know
that
you
stated
very
frankly
to
indicate,
particularly
in
escobedo,
the
uniform
course
--
the
decision
of
this
court
had
been
on
the
totality
of
things.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
anything
short
of
escobedo
would
suggest
a
different
history
in
this
court,
as
a
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
spano
itself
was
used
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
i
understood,
has
gone
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
upon
the
concurrence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
wouldn't
deny
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
wouldn't
deny
that
he
was
held
obviously
in
function,
would
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
in
this
question
is
it
not
as
it
always
well
of
the
approach
you
made
how
liberally
you
would
construe
the
bill
of
rights
amendment
just
when
in
duty.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
the
provision
doesn't
say
that.
it
doesn't
say
it
depends
on
the
totality,
but
that's
the
matter
to
be
compelled
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
its
natural
inference,
isn't
it,
that
if
a
man
who's
taken
under
arrest.
he's
taken
under
compulsion.
he's
expelled
to
go
away
and
tell
him
to
go
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
the
general
idea
is
that
a
man
is
arrested
only
if
you
detain
him
in
order
to
await
a
proper
trial
in
the
court,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
the
fourth
amendment
say?
justice
john
m.
harlan
reasonable,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
a
difference
in
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
there's
also
a
difference
between
saying
no
unreasonable
search
should
be
made
and
no
witness
shall
be
compelled,
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
agree
with
you
--
i
agree
with
you
when
you
say
unreasonable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
guess
we'd
all
agree
that
you
need
--
that
he
should
have
a
lawyer
when
he
actually
becomes
desperately
in
need
of
a
lawyer,
wouldn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
the
government
has
taken
him
in
and
charged.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wonder
the
simplest
rule
on
that
basis
to
be
to
adopt
the
english
rule
that
no
statement
by
the
police
can
be
used
in
evidence
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
english
--
those
are
the
two
broad
differences
between
i
think
it
would
have
been
much
argued
here
for
two
days
and
what
has
exemplified
because
the
difference
in
english
practice
and
our
practice.
there
in
no
ways
will
permit
now
and
we're
being
asked
to
the
rule
that
they're
very
away
from
it.
