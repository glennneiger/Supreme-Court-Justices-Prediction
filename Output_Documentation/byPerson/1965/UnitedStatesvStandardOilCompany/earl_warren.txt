mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
asking
this
for
a
per
se
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
why
you
stipulated
that
this
was
accidental,
you
didn't
attempt
to
show
any
negligence
or
anything,
but
you
stipulated
that
it
was
accidental.
was
that
in
order
to
have
us
--
give
you
a
per
se
(inaudible)
on
this
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
this
goes
back
for
trial,
are
you
precluded
from
showing
this
is
negligence
have
caused
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
pipe
just
corroded
and
the
gasoline
escaped,
would
you
contend
that
they
suffered
this
to
be
done
and
that
the
statute
applied
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
if
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
add
when
i
asked
if
you're
on
the
per
se
rule
because
it's
one
thing
if
they
left
that
valve
opened
negligently
and
that
the
gasoline
be
discharged,
it
might
be
entirely
another
thing
if
the
pipe
corrodes
for
instance
and
broke
and
then
the
gasoline
poured
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
not
asking
this
to
go
that
far.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
was
the
broader
of
the
two
laws,
the
earlier
or
the
later?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
later
was
the
broader?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hadlow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hadlow,
i
purport
your
statement
that
this
is
an
obstruction
statute
only,
seems
to
me
i've
read
the
number
of
instances
where
they
have
prosecuted
ships
for
discharging
oil
in
a
navigable
stream
or
a
bay.
what
statute
have
they
prosecuted
those
(voice
overlap)
violations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
not
under
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
whether
if
it
was
accidental
or
willful,
if
it
did
not
follow
your
definition
of
refuse?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
mean
this,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
accidental
or
willful
if
the
ship
discharged
into
the
waterway
something
that
was
not
refuse
under
your
decision,
under
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
give
you
another
case,
suppose
your
ship
was
loaded
and
at
the
time
it
was
about
to
depart
to
determined
that
weather
conditions
being
taken
into
consideration
that
was
--
it
was
overloaded
and
they
had
--
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the
cargo
and
they
discharged
it
into
the
stream.
would
that
be
refuse?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
refuse
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
under
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
question
there.
what
was
the
basic
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
any
of
this
legislation?
was
it
to
regulate
the
disposal
of
refuse
or
was
it
to
prevent
pollution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
doesn't
have
to
be
obstruction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
this
has
to
do
with
pollution.
now
when
it
enacted
these
laws
it
referred
to
pollution,
what
was
the
basic
purpose
of
it?
was
it
to
regulate
the
manner
in
which
the
ships
dispose
the
refuse
or
was
it
to
prevent
the
pollution
of
our
waterways?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
under
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
this
gasoline
was
tainted
in
some
ways
so
that
it's
no
longer
merchantable
and
they
poured
it
into
the
stream
that
it
would
be
refuse
and
therefore
would
come
within
the
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
that
one
wouldn't
obstruct
--

justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewin.
