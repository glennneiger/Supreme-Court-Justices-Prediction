justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
we
suppose
to
say
if
--
that
the
district
court
was
wrong,
and
now
reverse?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
--
supposed
to
say
what's
the
right
rule
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
when
he
decide
not
to
reclaim
it,
if
it's
salvageable
that
these
--
that
the
moment
he
decides
not
to
reclaim
it,
it
becomes
a
refuse?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
if
i
--
if
i'm
sailing
down
the
river
or
if
on
a
canoe
going
the
river
and
i
just
get
to
the
bank
and
i
don't
want
that
canoe
anymore,
i
just
push
it
back
out
into
the
streams,
is
that
refuse
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
when
went
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
--
never
got
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
the
chlorine,
mode
of
chlorine,
negligent
based
--
negligently
sunk
and
then
decision
to
abandon.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
not
be
refuse?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
congress
just
would
normally
rely
what
this
normal
--
normally
we're
just
relying
on
the
normal
--
this
in
connection
to
throw
away
valuable
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
is
criminal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
criminal
sanctions,
there's
criminal
negligence,
criminal
negligence
is
covered
in
the
oil
pollution
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
said
it
can
abate
any
sort
of
water
pollution
which
is
contrary
to
the
health,
morals
and
general
welfare
of
this
country.
so
i'm
saying
it's
very
broad
language.
it
can
be
abated
by
any
sort
of
procedures
available
to
the
government.
i
would
say
that
it
could
very
easily
--
if
somebody
persistently
abuse
--
