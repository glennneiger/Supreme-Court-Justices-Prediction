did
you
say
that
that
part
of
the
statute
expressly
excludes
accidental
discharge
of
oil?
justice
abe
fortas
which
you
say
is
now
incorporated
as
part
of
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
of
the
same
title?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
that
--
suppose
you
had
a
refinery
located
near
a
river
and
for
some
economic
reason
whatever
it
might
be,
the
company
operating
their
refinery
decided
that
it
did
not
want
to
salvage
one
of
the
constituent
products
from
their
refining
process?
but
let
us
assume
that
that
constituent
product
had
a
--
has
a
value,
commercial
value,
market
value,
and
so
they
turned
it
into
the
stream.
in
your
construction,
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
because
it
would
not
be
inherently
a
refuse.
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
be
a
product
of
value.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
doing
as
i
understand
it
is
relating
the
standard,
the
word
refuse
to
the
matter
of
willfulness
and
you're
saying
that
unless
it
is
willful,
a
willful
and
deliberate
rejection
it
cannot
be
refuse.
now
we're
not
--
as
i
understand
it,
we
don't
here
have
to
struggle
with
the
question
of
whether
willfulness
is
necessary
under
this
statute.
but
your
--
what
you're
doing
as
i
understand
it
is
to
say
that
is
substance
is
not
refuse
unless
it
is
rejected
by
the
respon
--
person
responsible
for
its
deposit,
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
she
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
or
wasn't
the
gasoline
here
a
refuse
after
it
was
deposited
in
the
stream
in
the
same
way
as
conceded
by
your
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
after
it
was
deposited
in
the
stream,
it
was
not
valuable,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
that
barge
were
deliberately
sunk,
it
would
be
refuse
but
if
they
were
not
deliberately
sunk,
it
would
not
be
refuse.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
theory
anyway
under
the
second
part
of
the
statute
here,
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
new
federal
water
pollution
act
cover
this
situation?
i
know
that
--
i
believe
it
has
no
criminal
proceedings
but
do
the
abatement
provisions
in
the
new
water
pollution
act
applied
to
this
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
persistently,
then
it
--
do
you
have
to
have
the
omen
of
persistent
abuse
for
purposes
of
abatement
under
the
water
pollution
act,
do
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
gather
you're
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you're
not
confident,
well,
that's
a
different
matter.
i
don't
want
to
get
an
--
misapprehens
in
what
you're
saying.
you're
not
representing
to
us
your
view
that
the
federal
water
pollution
act
would
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
situation,
that
is
to
say
the
one
time
discharge
of
gasoline
into
a
navigable
stream?
