mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lewin
has
set
forth
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
precisely.
i
add
to
that
only
the
fact
that
standard
oil
company
when
this
--
the
land
was
being
aired
during
the
cleaning
process
as
a
safety
precaution
and
when
they
reopened
the
land
from
the
shore
tank
to
the
dock
side,
the
employee
in-charge
of
it
had
left
open
the
valve
that
the
other
--
and
he
immediately
saw
it
run
over
and
closed
the
valve
but
a
few
hundred
gallons
had
spilled
out.
standard
oil
then
called
both
the
fire
department
and
the
coastguard
as
a
safety
precaution.one
which
we
submit
would
be
inhibited
by
any
such
interpretation
of
this
law
as
the
government
would
impose
on
people
of
absolute
liability
irrespective
of
cause.
they
called
the
coastguard
and
once
that
call
was
made,
even
though
the
thing
with
them
--
a
very
minor
insignificance,
it
was
said
into
effect
this
full
weight
of
the
governments
--
an
investigative
and
enforcement
procedure
ending
up
this
day
before
this
court.
the
statute
that's
involved
in
this
case,
section
407
of
title
33,
prohibits
in
very
plain
language
the
throwing,
discharging
or
depositing
of
any
refuse
matter
of
any
kind
or
description
other
than
sewage,
a
tremendous
pollution
exception,
other
than
all
sewage
in
the
navigable
waters.
it
was
plainly
an
anti-obstruction
statute
as
any
sort
of
reading
of
all
of
the
first
section
of
33
u.s.code
will
evidence
you.
it's
an
anti-obstruction
statute.
the
first
half
made
it
unlawful
to
throw,
discharge
or
to
deposit
any
refuse
matter
of
any
kind
in
the
navigable
waters.
now
the
government
in
this
case
was
faced
with
the
fact
that
the
material
that
was
deposited
was
valuable
aviation
gasoline.
that
can't
be
changed
so
the
only
way
they
could
proceed
under
this
statute
is
to
eliminate
the
word,
the
descriptive
adjective
written
from
that
statute.
and
they
have
eliminated
it
by
--
it
by
analogizing
and
saying
that
refuse
matter
is
synonymous
with
any
matter
of
any
sort
or
any
foreign
matter.
and
that
is
--
that's
any
matter
of
any
sort
of
pure
water,
mr.
lewin
was
perfectly
frank
about
that.
he
thinks
that
this
statute
saying
any
refuse
matter
covers
any
matter
of
any
sort
other
than
pure
water.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
that's
my
position.
the
statute
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
all
i
say
is
--
excuse
me
sir.
all
i
say
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
would
inhibit
prosecution,
even
under
those
circumstances.
a
better
example
i
believe
is
the
one
that
mr.
chief
justice
suggested
a
minute
ago,
if
the
valve
broke
without
any
faults
or
responsibility.
then,
standard
oil's
gasoline
would
have
--
been
placed
into
or
discharged
into
the
river
and
i
think
we
would
be
--
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
absolutely
without
fault.criminal
liability
without
fault.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
criminal
liability
without
fault
and
that's
one
of
the
issues
that
we
will
subsequently
urge
is
all
the
more
reason
that
the
language
must
be
precisely
read
because
the
only
protective
provision
of
this
statute
is
the
limiting
adjective,
refuse.
there
are
several
ways
that
congress
could
have
given
the
public
some
protection.they
could
have
limited
the
amount
of
the
spill.
as
we've
done
in
the
second
half
of
this
act,
when
they
said
that
it
had
to
be
sufficient
to
impede
navigation
to
make
a
stacking
on
the
bank
illegal,
they
could
have
said
as
they
did
in
the
oil
pollution
act
of
accidental
spills
without
fault
are
excluded
in
the
oil
pollution
act
of
1924.
or
they
could
have
done
it
as
they
did
here.
they
could
have
said,
only
refuse
is
covered
because
that
is
a
limiting
word.
i've
--
i
mention
to
say
if
you
ask
a
thousand
town
people,
if
refuse
meant
any
matter
of
any
sort,
you
wouldn't
get
a
single
person
to
say
that's
what
it
meant
or
that
is
what
you
could
reasonably
construe
or
believe
it
to
mean.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
--
those
prosecuted
mr.
chief
justice,
under
the
oil
pollution
act
of
1924.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
there's
a
later
section
of
this
same
act.
this
--
it's
the
later
section
of
title
33
was
passed
in
1924
and
it
does
--
does
not
have
a
word
refuse
in
it.
it
profit
--
it
makes
a
criminal
offense,
the
dispensing
of
oil
into
the
navigable
waters
of
any
sort
of
oil.
it
specifically
says
oil,
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
goes
into
some
detail
about
problems
they
were
having
with
1899
act
about
whether
or
not
oil
had
to
be
refuse
or
waste
oil
or
not.
so
they
clarified
it
as
--
with
respect
to
oil
from
ships
in
1924.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
yes
sir
and
under
the
oil
pollution
act
of
1924.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
but
not
the
one
we're
proceeding
under,
that's
another
separate
section
of
this
title.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
of
the
same
title,
yes
sir.
and
it
specifically
excludes
accidental
or
"acts
of
god",
or
discharges
the
--
unconnected
with
fault
which
definitely
is
not
here.
well,
to
summarize
briefly
if
i
may,
the
argument
that
standard
oil
uses
against
the
government
position,
it
seems
clean
to
standard
oil
that
the
statute
doesn't
say
what
the
government
says
it
does.
it
simply
doesn't
--
it
says
refuse,
it
doesn't
say
any
matter.
it
could
have
been
any
matter
in
several
other
federal
statutes
have
said
that.
the
new
york
harbor
act
says,
the
1894
act
that
he
said,
mentioned
and
said
it,
but
this
one
doesn't.
this
one
says
refuse,
a
limiting
word.
the
second
point
is
would
this
highly
sophisticated
interpretation
which
the
government
would
impose
upon
this
normal
word,
would
it
give
the
public
fair
notice?
mr.
lewin
was
frank
to
admit,
in
respect
to
that
that
there's
not
much
a
reliance
on
that
but
we
don't
get
the
notice,
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
public
doesn't
get
fair
notice.
is
there
any
specific
logical
congressional
history
to
justify
this
strained
construction
that
he
imposes
on
us.
and
i'd
say
there's
not
a
word.
the
only
thing
that
his
research
in
mind
could
find
in
the
congressional
history
in
1899,
was
a
very
brief
five
senatorial
remarks
were
urging
the
senate
to
pass
it
without
discussions
saying,
we're
not
trying
to
make
any
material
change,
we're
simply
trying
to
wind
up
one
of
--
which
the
--
is
codifying
existing
law
and
to
eliminate
one
or
two
ambiguity.
that
seems
to
me
the
most
obvious
ambiguity
of
all
is
the
one
between
barring
all
waste
that
it
was
in
1894
act.
all
matter
of
any
sort
in
1894
act
which
applies
by
the
ways
only
to
rivers
and
harbors
on
which
congress
had
previously
appropriated
money
in
answer
to
a
question
that
you
asked
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lewin
said
that
the
later
act
was
broader
but
that
--
it
was
not
broader
in
scope,
it
applies
to
a
limited
theory.
the
1890
act
was
broad
over
all
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
that
day,
it
applies
to
all
rivers.
the
1894
act
was
imposed
on
top
of
it
later.
without
repelling
the
1890
act,
instead
as
to
these
few
rivers
which
we've
already
appropriated
money
in
respect
to
--
as
to
those
rivers,
it
shall
be
wrongful
to
deposit
any
matter
of
any
sort.
then
in
1899,
they
have
two
of
this,
congress
was
going
to
codify
existing
law,
with
almost
no
congressional
approval,
they
took
the
two
existing
laws,
they
put
the
1890
act
in
my
view
and
passed
it
almost
verbatim
again.
they've
--
so
that
act
said
that
would
be
illegal
to
deposit
any
waste
or
refuse
matter
of
any
sort
in
the
river.
they
were
faced
with
a
choice
when
they
selected
the
narrow
and
not
the
broad
approach.
it
seems
inconceivable
to
me
that
they
were
faced
with
a
choice.
the
two
statutes
were
right,
the
form,
one
of
them
saying
any
matter,
one
of
them
saying
any
waste
or
refuse.
they'd
selected
the
narrow
and
the
government
says
they
meant
to
select
the
broad
and
that
the
narrow
must
submit
the
broad.
well,
i
can't
just
follow
that
at
all.
that
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
well,
the
only
way
you
can
say
that
they've
collected
both
your
honor
is
if
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
is
that
a
codification
designed
not
to
make
any
material
change
in
the
law
but
simply
to
eliminate
one
or
two
ambiguities
and
this
is
the
only
ambiguity
we've
been
able
to
find,
the
one
between
any
matter
on
the
one
hand
and
any
refuse
on
the
other.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
and
finally
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
my
final
point
in
here
is
there
any
need
for
the
government's
awkward
construction
of
the
statute
and
i
say
there
has
been
none
shown,
none
in
the
congressional
history.
no
practical
needs
proven
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any.
briefly,
that
really
concluded
my
summary
of
what
i
--
what
i'm
going
to
argue
and
i
got
really
just
carried
away
when
my
summary
that
i
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
in
my
brief,
i
pointed
out
two
very
good
reasons
i
believe
your
honor,
for
that
difference.
in
the
first
place,
the
second
section
which
is
broader
saying,
any
material
which
is
stacked
alongside
the
bank
is
a
violation.
that
is
likely
to
be
washed
into
the
river
and
impede
navigation,
has
a
protective
kicker
on
the
ends
of
it
and
that
is,
it
must
be
such
a
large
deposit
that
it
will
impede
navigation.
the
public
is
given
some
protection
against
willy-nilly
enforcement
of
liability
without
fault
there.
it
must
be
a
large
deposit.
and
second,
it
is
likely
that
a
person
will
deposit
valuable,
useable
material
alongside
of
a
bank
purposely
or
in
a
negligent
manner
where
it
will
be
washed
into
the
river.
but
it
is
--
and
it's
therefore
you
need
a
statute
protecting
against
that
course
of
conduct.
but
it
is
totally
unlikely
that
you
will
purposefully
deposit
valuable
material
into
the
river.
and
therefore,
you
don't
need
the
same
amount
of
protection
against
that.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
no
sir.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
no
sir,
i
--
it
is
the
government
that
ties
refuse
to
value.
it
is
not
our
--
i
say
that
it
is
material
which
is
thrown
away,
rejected,
refuse
and
the
material
that
you
describe
in
your
analogy
is
both.
the
value
is
absolutely
immaterial.
if
the
(inaudible)
--
if
the
effluent
or
refuse
may
be
valuable
and
have
some
value
and
they
poured
it
into
the
river
and
they're
nevertheless
determining
willfully
to
reject
it,
to
refuse
it
then
it's
covered
under
the
act.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
refuse
is
in
the
eye
of
the
person
holding
the
material.
it
does
not
have
to
be
willfully
poured
into
the
river
because
a
garbage
truck
could
be
bouncing
along
with
a
load
of
refuse
and
negligently
dumped
it
in
there
and
there
would
be
the
element
of
negligence.
or
you
could
have
material
which
you
have
determined
to
be
refuse
or
any
reason
and
it
could
negligently
get
in
the
river.
but
what
i
say
is
not
covered
is
the
accidental
spillage
into
the
river
of
valuable
material,
when
it
did
not
go
in
willfully
and
therefore
would
not
refuse
nor
was
it
otherwise
refuse.
it
seems
to
me
there's
more
than
one
way
for
it
to
be
refuse.
but
there's
one
way
that
cannot
be
reached
is
to
say
that
valuable
material
accidentally
spilled
is
refuse.
i
just
can't
think
of
any
possible
description
of
the
word
that
doesn't
read
it
right
out
of
existence,
it
obliterates
it
from
the
statute.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
my
definition
of
refuse
is
brought
in
a
--
and
it
seems
to
me
to
cover
almost
any
material.
and
i'm
not
certain
i
understood
your
question
sir.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
under
my
definition
of
refuse,
if
it's
waste
oil
for
example,
whether
when
in
accidentally
or
on
purpose,
it
would
be
refuse.
if
it
was
valuable
oil
and
it
went
in
on
purpose,
they
must
have
thrown
it
in
as
refuse,
so
it
would
be
covered.
if
it
was
valuable
oil,
accidentally
discharged,
then
it
would
not
violate
the
statute.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
in
my
view,
that's
plainly
refuse.
they
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
it
is
plainly
refuse
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
yes
sir
that's
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
they
have
determined
to
dispose
of
it
and
they
did.
now
whether
it
has
some
value
a
moment
before
is
immaterial
but
they've
--
they
made
it
refuse
when
they
elected
to
throw
it
away,
and
that
would
be
covered.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
no
sir.
my
response
to
the
chief
justice
was
that
when
the
people
determined
to
lighten
their
load
and
reject
and
all
these
--
throw
away
the
oil,
that
was
refuse.
they
determined
to
do
so.
in
an
accidental
spill,
it
was
not
refuse,
it
was
valuable
material
accidentally
falling
out
into
the
river.
the
time
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
the
time,
the
critical
time
as
to
whether
it's
refuse
or
not
is
when
it
goes
in,
not
what
it
becomes
afterwards
because
in
the
navigable
streams
of
this
country
almost
anything
that
falls
into
the
river
becomes
refuse
once
it
gets
in
there.
and
that
--
and
if
that
were
the
determining
factor,
those
--
the
car
load
of
diamonds
becomes
refuse.
and
the
government's
own
brief
uses
a
tremendous
example
it
seems
to
me
of
how
far
they
will
go
with
--
once
they
are
(inaudible)
--
once
they
are
freed
from
the
des
--
limiting
descriptive
word
refuse.
there's
no
length
of
it
--
were
a
logical
thinking,
they
used
the
example
of
a
barge
full
of
chlorine,
a
valuable
barge
full
of
chlorine.
it
sunk
in
the
mississippi
river
and
stayed
there
a
year
or
two
and
the
owner
abandoned
it
finally.
and
after
abandoning,
the
government
went
in
and
dug
it
up.
the
value
of
the
cargo
and
the
barge
when
they
got
it
up
after
being
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
for
two
years
was
$80,000.
but
the
government
in
its
brief
claims
that
could
be
refuse
because
the
cost
of
getting
it
up
was
a
million
dollars
and
that
the
--
now
it
seems
to
me
that
shows
you
the
literature
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
yes
sir.
to
me
that's
entirely
plain
that
if
you
abandon
the
barge
and
throw
it
away
and
throw
it
in
there
as
refuse,
no
matter
how
it's
built
or
what
it
is.
but
if
it's
accidentally
sunk,
the
thought
of
a
barge
full
of
a
valuable
cargo
being
a
refuse
when
it's
accidentally
sunk
and
being
subjective
of
this
mandatory
penalty
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
well,
that
--
not
under
my
view.
my
view
is
once
that
--
it
depends
on
how
it
gets
into
the
navigable
waters.
if
it
is
thrown
in
there
or
disposed
of,
and
that's
what
the
act
says
that
you
throw
it
or
dispose
of
it
or
dispatch
it
into
the
river.
it
doesn't
say
what
happens
to
it
after
it
gets
in.
and
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
that's
--
in
my
view,
that's
refuse.
you
refuse
it,
you
threw
it
away.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
well,
you
put
it
back
in
when
you
abandon
it.
when
you
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
well,
that's
the
refinement
that
i
wasn't
prepared
to
go
to
but
for
all
practical
purposes,
you
made
a
new
decision
on
that
canoe
when
you
got
out
on
the
bank.
you
then
threw
it
into
the
water
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
no
sir.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
the
sinking
of
a
valuable
barge
is
simply
not
refuse.
that
was
not
refuse
or
rejected
or
anything.
it
went
down.
now,
there's
another
separate
statute
on
the
books,
section
403
of
the
same
title.
that
is
directly
aimed
at
sunken
barges
that
impede
navigation.
and
in
the
very
case
that's
cited
by
mr.
lewin
in
his
brief,
they
did
not
even
mentioned
the
refuse
statute.
the
chlorine
barge,
they
preceded
under
section
403.
and
that
--
it's
only
applicability
here
is
to
show
you
that
if
you
eliminate
the
restricted
word
refuse
from
the
refuse
statute,
you
can
--
there's
no
end
to
where
you
can
go.
if
two
automobiles
run
off
of
a
pier,
as
one
did
in
jacksonville
just
a
week
ago,
the
value
of
the
automobile
before
it
went
in
is
going
to
determine
under
mr.
lewin's
theory
whether
it's
refuse
or
not.
well,
if
it's
a
valuable
car
and
you
have
some
salvage
value,
then
it's
alright.
if
the
car
was
an
old
cheap
car
and
the
cost
of
salvaging
it
exceeded
the
value
of
the
car
then
it
would
be
refuse
and
you'd
be
--
you
violated
a
criminal
statute.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
the
second
part
of
the
statute
is
the
stacking
part
which
says
that
if
you
stack
or
deposit
it
alongside
of
a
bank
where
it
is
likely
to
be
washed
into
a
stream
and
impede
navigation,
then
you
have
violated
the
second
half.
the
--
i
see,
i
only
have
few
more
minutes.
the
legislative
history
on
which
the
government
based
this
substantially,
its
own
case,
simply
takes
two
acts
which
involve
a
choice.
it
seems
to
me,
one
of
them
broad
and
one
of
them
narrow,
the
government
selected
the
narrow
one.
and
the
government
then
would
impose
on
this
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
they
should
have
or
they
meant
to
somehow
pick
the
broad
one.
as
a
matter
of
interest,
11
years
later,
they
passed
another
act
almost
identical
to
this
one,
applying
to
lake
michigan
and
it's
found
in
33
u.s.c.
421.
and
11
years
later,
they
used
the
same
language
of
refuse,
the
narrow
language
instead
of
the
broad.
the
new
york
harbor
act
was
changed
from
the
narrow
to
the
broad
but
not
by
judicial
construction,
they
simply
amended
the
statute
in
1888
from
the
1886
statute
and
they
went
from
refuse
and
waste
matter
to
any
matter.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
impossible
to
believe
that
congress
did
not
understand
the
difference
between
the
narrow
word
and
the
broad
when
they
have
used
the
two
in
separate
statutes.
and
in
the
same
statute
and
in
the
two-halves
of
this
very
same
statute,
they
used
the
narrow
in
the
beginning
and
the
broad
in
the
second
half.
they
say,
“refuse
that
is
forwarded
into
the
stream
and
any
matter
or
material
if
it's
stacked
along
the
bank
where
it's
likely
to
be
washed
in.”
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
in
my
view,
there's
--
that
would
--
under
my
section
of
brief
where
i
talk
about
the
need
for
it,
i'd
say
--
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
--
it
is
so
unlikely
that
a
person
will
normally
repetitiously
throw
away
valuable
materials
that
there
is
simply
no
need
for
criminal
sanctions
against
it.
and
in
1948,
at
the
very
end
of
this
title,
the
government
had
passed
a
long
comprehensive
water
pollution
act
under
which
without
criminal
sanctions,
the
government
can
prohibit
and
update
nuisances
to
water
pollute
(voice

--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
--
new
(voice
overlap)
water
pollution.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
in
the
oil
pollution
act
of
1924
but
there's
a
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
--
comprehensive
water
pollution
act
which
had
just
been
passed.
it
was
just
amended
for
1965.
but
if
it's
been
on
the
books
since
1948
and
there's
a
water
pollution
control
commission
and
they
have
the
right
to
abate
any
sort
of
pollution
to
the
navigable
water
of
this
country
now.
and
that's
the
act
the
government
ought
to
proceed
under
and
they're
not
limited
in
anyway
by
this
readable
construction
of
this
act.
the
only
construction
it
seems
to
me
which
give
the
public
fair
notice
of
the
crime
of
which
it
might
be
guilty.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
i
assume
that
under
the
enforcement,
that
they
were
the
--
there's
a
persistent
course
of
conduct
that
they
would
be
after.
and
it
seems
to
me
after
all
that
needn't
--
need
be
protected
against.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
and
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
i
don't
think
they
will
--
that
it's
designed
for
that
purpose.
and
i
don't
think
that's
likely
they'll
use
it
for
that
purpose
and
neither
do
i
think
this
was
designed
for
that
purpose.
just
to
conclude
if
i
may,
the
government
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
it
was
to
prevent
obstruction
of
the
water
by
regulating
the
disposal
of
all
sorts
of
enumerated
waste.
the
18
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
this
does
not
have
to
be
obstruction.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
it
was
to
--
i
hate
to
argue
with
the
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
--
with
you
sir,
but
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
i
think
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
--
it
was
designed
to
prevent
the
filing
of
the
waterways.
it
leaves
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
it
was
mostly
for
obstruction
that
--
and
twice
in
that
same
statute
it
refers
to
obstruction
of
navigation.
there
was
an
exception
at
the
bottom
that
neither
side
has
mentioned
in
this
case
because
i
hadn't
been
material
where
the
department
of
the
--
army
engineers
can
permit
refuse
to
be
put
in
the
water
if
it
doesn't
feel
that
it
would
restrict
unduly
navigation
and
impede
navigation.
that's
right
in
this
same
section,
407.
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
no
sir.--
wouldn't
obstruct
the
navigation?
mr.
earl
b.
hadlow
you
do
as
the
requirement
of
an
obstruction
of
navigation
does
not
apply
to
the
first
half
of
the
act,
but
i'd
say
that
this
act
in
all
of
the
sections
surrounding
in
at
the
time
of
passage
was
designed
and
aimed
at
prohibiting
the
fouling
of
those
waters.
if
the
1890
act
lists
18
different
kinds
of
material
and
every
one
of
them
was
a
waste
product,
a
refuse,
a
residue,
saw
dust,
ashes,
cinders,
it's
everything
and
then
finally
concluded
with
refuse
or
waste
matter
of
any
sort.
that's
what
they
were
aimed
at.
now
if
--
my
concluding
remark
is
this,
the
government
in
its
brief
is
frank
to
admit
that
you
could
be
prosecuted
for
the
most
trivial
spillage
under
this
act.
and
it
says,
in
one
of
the
most
unusual
statements
and
one
of
the
most
frank
statements
i've
ever
heard,
that
the
protection
that
the
public
need
in
a
case
like
this,
comes
from
the
good
conscience
and
circumspection
of
prosecutors.
and
i
submit
our
own
case
is
the
best
and
most
conclusive
evidence
that
you'd
done
that
that
certain
inspection
is
off
and
absent.
we
have
con
--
we've
cooperated
with
every
arm
of
the
united
states
government
in
this
case.
the
united
states
engineers,
the
coastguard,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
i
worked
--
i've
worked
with
them
from
the
very
beginning
on
this
case,
nobody
could
stop
it,
it
just
got
--
there
was
snowball
in
the
long
and
not
a
soul
would
stop
this
little
case.
another
case
that's
cited
in
the
government's
brief
is
united
states
versus
standard
oil
of
california
and
california
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
and
fined
of
a
crime
because
of
two
barrels
of
bunker
c
fuel
oil
in
hawaii
harbor.once
the
case
gets
started
there's
no
stopping
it.and
it
is
not
right
under
american
jurisprudence
to
subject
a
major
corporation
to
a
criminal
conviction
because
it
lost
two
barrels
of
bunker
c
fuel
oil.
thank
you.
