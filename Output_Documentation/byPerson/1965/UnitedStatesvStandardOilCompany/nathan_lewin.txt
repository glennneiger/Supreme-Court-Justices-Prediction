mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
direct
appeal
from
the
dismissal
by
a
district
court
in
the
middle
district
of
florida
of
a
one-count
information
charging
the
standard
oil
company
of
kentucky
with
having
caused,
suffered
and
procured
the
discharge
of
gasoline
into
navigable
waters
in
violation
of
section
13
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
the
facts
relevant
to
a
disposition
of
the
case
appear
in
a
stipulation
which
is
at
pages
5
to
7
of
the
trial
--
of
the
transcript
of
record
and
that
stipulation
was
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
made
by
standard
oil.
it
discloses
that
in
november
1963,
after
having
completed
the
process
of
repairing
and
cleaning
a
line
connecting
the
company's
bulk
storage
tank,
we
have
certain
dock
facilities
on
the
same
challenged
river,
the
company,
the
employees,
ran
aviation
gasoline
from
the
tank
into
the
line.
they
then
accidentally
left
open
the
main
shut
off
valve,
and
300
gallons
of
the
gasoline
spilled
from
the
line
on
to
the
docks
and
into
the
river.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
there's
a
minimum
fine.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
issue
of
course
isn't
here
right
now
but
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
means
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
--
i
think
they
are
--
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
in
terms
of
a
fine,
yes.
i
don't
think
that
that
the
--
well,
the
infringement
certainly
is
the
--
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
is
mandatory
provides
either
for
minimum
infringe
--
that
either
for
a
minimum
fine
or
imprisonment,
therefore,
if
it's
a
natural
person
who
commits
the
offense,
of
course
he
can
be
fined
and
not
imprisoned.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
he
must
be
fined.
i
think
that's
true,
but
that's
not
involved
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
the
amount
of
the
spill
just
to
return
the
facts
very
briefly
was
not
sufficient
to
impede
navigation
or
to
cause
any
fire
or
explosion.
but
the
matter
was
reported
to
the
jacksonville
fire
department
and
to
the
coastguard
which
arrived
and
dissipated
the
gasoline
into
the
river.
the
st.johns
river
is
concededly
a
navigable
water
and
the
gasoline,
it
was
concededly
valuable
and
useable
before
it
was
unintentionally
spilled
into
the
river.
the
relevant
portion
of
the
governing
statute
which
appears
at
page
2
of
our
brief
is
--
and
here,
i'm
just
quoting
the
relevant
portions,
makes
it
an
offense
to
throw,
discharge
or
deposit,
or
cause,
suffer
or
procured
to
be
thrown,
discharged
or
deposited
from
the
shore,
any
refuse
matter
of
any
kind
or
description
whatever,
into
any
navigable
water
of
the
united
states.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
information
on
the
ground
that
valuable
and
useable
materials
such
as
the
gasoline
in
this
case
was
not
refuse
matter
within
the
meaning
of
section
13.
our
contention
here
is
that
that
was
error
because
refuse
matter
as
used
in
that
statute
does
not
make
this
--
the
applicability
of
the
statute
turn
on
how
valuable
or
useless
the
matter
that
spills
under
the
river
is
to
its
owner
but
on
the
effect
it
has
on
the
water
into
which
it
is
spilled.
since
gasoline
is
clearly
a
polluting
material,
we
believe
that
the
stipulated
fact
stated
in
offense
and
that
the
district
court's
order
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
sent
back
for
trial.
now
our
construction
of
section
13,
is
supported
we
believe
by
the
three
standard
touchstones
for
legislative
interpretation.
it's
most
consistent
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
statute
was
enacted.
it's
--
our
construction
we
believe
is
entirely
clear
as
a
matter
of
legislative
history
that
it
was
congress'
intent
to
cover
the
kind
of
conduct
that
was
involved
here.
and
finally,
we
believe
that
even
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself
construing
the
provision
in
its
entirety,
section
13
as
a
whole,
it
would
be
clear
to
any
reader
of
the
statute
that
it
must
apply
to
use
a
valuable
matter
which
spills
negligently
or
unintentionally
into
a
river
as
well
as
to
useless
matter.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
--
it's
entirely
clear,
we
think
from
the
very
broad
language
that
the
statute
uses
and
from
the
history
--
the
legislative
course
before
its
enactment
in
1899,
that
congress
was
concerned
with
two
evils,
one
being
obstruction
to
navigation
and
the
second
being
the
discharge
of
damaging
materials
or
injurious
deposits,
as
it
was
called
in
our
predecessor
statute
into
navigable
waters,
in
other
words,
pollution.
congress
also
meant
to
cover
the
entire
range
of
conduct
which
could
lead
to
these
evils.
the
statutory
terms
which
cover
not
only
the
throwing,
discharge
or
deposit,
but
also
anybody
who
causes,
suffers,
or
procures,
the
word
suffer
is
we
think
is
particularly
broad,
discloses
that
congress
was
reaching
not
only
willful
and
intentional
dumping
but
any
form
of
negligence
or
other
kind
of
fault
which
could
cause
the
discharge
of
these
kind
of
materials
into
the
water.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
this
--
we
think
that
the
statute
in
effect
requires
that,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.we
think
that
the
statute
said
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
wasn't
done
with
any
such
intention
at
the
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
intend
to
prove
at
the
--
at
trial
that
it
was
actually
negligence
or
a
form
of
fault
that
caused
the
spill
into
the
river.
and
we
read
the
word
accidental
is
not
precluding
that
kind
of
evidence.
of
course,
that
wasn't
the
issue
in
which
the
district
court
dismissed
the
information
and
we
think
that
under
this
court's
decisions
really,
the
only
question
presently
before
the
court
wouldn't
touch
on
whether
there's
a
per
se
rule
or
not.
the
only
question
presently
before
the
court
is,
whether
the
district
court's
reading
of
the
statute
was
correct,
in
other
words,
whether
the
word
refuse
matter
applies
only
to
valueless
rather
than
valuable
materials.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
district
court
was
wrong
and
the
case
is
reversed
for
trial,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
right
rule
is
that
--
yes,
the
right
rule
is
that
refuse
matter
includes
valuable
as
well
as
valueless
material.
that's
what
the
district
court
held,
that
was
its
construction
and
we
submit
a
misconstruction
of
the
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
now
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
we
say
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
exactly
our
position.
we
say,
refuse
is
not
what
the
owner
doesn't
want
but
what
the
river
as
it
were
doesn't
want.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
solely
for
the
purpose
in
a
motion
to
dismiss.
therefore,
even
if
the
district
court
would
hold
that
the
stipulation
read
very,
very
strictly
means
only
acts
--
means
that
the
spill
was
entirely
accidental
as
it
were
by
an
"act
of
god"
we
wouldn't
be
precluded
from
preceding
a
trial
to
prove
negligence
because
that
situation
was
limited
only
for
the
purpose
of
motion
to
dismiss.
and
the
--
it
was
i
dare
say,
a
missed
choice
of
terms,
i
think
the
facts
on
their
face
is
stated
in
the
stipulation
to
indicate
that
there
was
somebody
who
was
careless
and
let
the
valve
open.
and
that's
what
we
would
intend
to
prove
at
a
retrial
--
at
a
trial.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
we
can
prove
it
here.
i
really
don't
know.
i
think
it
would
be
very
hard
to
apply
--
to
apply
the
statute
when
they
were
--
we're
entirely
inadvertent
and
it
were
an
"act
of
god"
that
caused
the
spill.
mr.
nathan
lewin
although
that
question
isn't
here
now.
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute.
now,
we
really
--
it
would
really
be
quite
an
extension
to
read
suffer
as
meaning
totally
in
harmless
or
as
imposing
liability
without
cause.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
if
we
couldn't
find
any
fault
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
if
they
--
i
think
there
might
be
an
obligation
to
check
these
pipes
from
time
to
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
if
the
pipes
had
been
checked
and
they
were
in
good
order
and
they
just
broke
on
their
own,
i
think
it'd
be
quite
hard
to
read
the
word
suffers
encompassing
that
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
we
agree,
we'd
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
and
i
don't
think
that
question
really
has
to
be
reached
on
--
at
this
posture
of
the
case.
the
only
question
i
think
that
has
to
be
reached
before
we
introduce
any
proof
at
all
really
is
whether
the
statute
reaches
the
kind
of
conduct
and
not
which
the
district
judge
held
it
did
not,
which
is
the
deposit
of
valuable
material
or
the
discharge
of
valuable
material
into
the
river.
now,
in
terms
of
the
statute's
purpose,
it
hardly
makes
any
sense
to
say
that
congress
intended
to
make
it
a
crime
negligently
to
deposit
discarded
material
into
a
river,
but
not
to
make
it
a
crime
negligently
to
deposit
valuable
material
into
the
river.
if
the
statute
were
in
terms
of
willfulness,
if
the
statute
had
a
willful
element
then
the
fact
that
the
material
were
not
discarded
or
valueless,
would
be
an
indication,
it
would
be
some
proof
of
willfulness
because
people
can
--
that
can
be
presumed,
would
not
be
willfully
depositing
their
valuable
material,
whatever
it
may
be
into
the
river.
but
when
--
if
congress
was
concerned,
as
we
think
the
statute
clearly
indicates
with
negligent
conduct
as
well
as
with
willful
conduct,
then
it
makes
far
more
sense
to
look
at
the
results
because
people
after
all
are
negligent
with
property
that
they
considered
valuable
to
them
just
as
they
may
be
with
property
that
they
consider
valueless,
highway
accidents,
countless
number
of
highway
accidents
prove
that,
people
are
negligent
with
property
which
you
say
consider
valuable.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
the
same
section
that
this
court
discussed
in
the
republic
steel
case,
yes.
so,
we
submit
that
so
far
as
the
purity
of
the
river
is
concerned,
and
that
was
what
congress
is
aiming
at,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
oil
or
gasoline
is
desired
by
its
owner
or
is
not
desired
by
its
owner.
the
history
of
section
13
which
is
the
--
we
think
the
second
touchstone
which
establishes
our
construction
of
statute
establishes,
we
think
not
only
that
nobody
in
congress
conceives
of
a
distinction
or
abrogate
any
thought
of
--
possible
thought
to
the
distinction
that
the
district
court
here
relied
upon
but
indeed,
that
in
light
of
all
the
prior
statutes
congress'
intention
was
clearly
to
cover
the
conduct
involved
here.
in
1896,
after
--
there
had
been
a
series
of
river
and
harbor
statutes
mainly
appropriations
bill
into
each
one
of
which
there
was
(inaudible)
one
or
more
provisions
pertaining
to
pollution
or
destruction
of
the
rivers,
congress
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
war
the
task
of
codifying
these
areas
provisions.
and
in
1899,
that
codification
was
submitted
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
the
senate
and
the
relevance
to
--
the
section,
they
were
in
effect
10
sections
that
were
aided
for
the
1899
river
and
harbor
appropriations
bill.
and
one
of
those
sections
is
the
present
--
is
the
one
here
involved.
now,
it's
entirely
clear
from
the
discussion
on
the
floor
of
congress
when
the
bill
was
introduced
and
we've
reproduced
that
as
appendix
b
of
our
brief,
that
the
senator
who
presented
it
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
as
well
as
those
who
spoke
in
support
of
it
and
that's
in
effect
the
entire
legislative
history
for
all
intents
and
purposes
of
section
13,
thought
that
they
were
doing
nothing
more
than
codifying
existing
law.
now
what
was
existing
law?
it
included
the
river
and
harbors
act
of
1894,
which
appears
at
page
24
of
our
brief.
and
the
river
and
harbors
act
of
1894
made
it
an
offense,
stated
that
it
will
--
it
shall
not
be
lawful
to
deposit
a
whole
enumeration
of
materials
and
ended
with
the
statement
or
any
other
matter
of
any
kind
into
certain
navigable
waters
for
which
congress
had
appropriated
by
it.
now
that
enumeration
included
for
example,
assets
which
certainly
could
be
of
a
valuable
material.
and
clearly
we
think,
and
i
don't
--
we
think
our
appellee
doesn't
dispute
this,
that
that
statute
covered
valuable
deposits
as
well
as
valueless
one.
now,
congress
was
not
intending
to
change
existing
law
when
it
enacted
section
13
of
the
river
and
harbors
act
of
1899,
then
it
must
have
meant
to
include
precisely
the
provisions
which
was
included
in
the
river
and
harbors
act
of
1894.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
river
and
harbors
act
of
18
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
river
and
harbors
act
of
1890
mr.
justice
stewart
was
also
existing
law
and
that
was
more
limited.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
agree
that
it
was.
it
covered
only
other
waste
of
any
kind.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
we
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
submit
mr.
justice
stewart
that
those
two
were
not
inconsistent,
they
were
prohibitions,
one
of
which
was
broader
than
the
other.
now,
we
submit
that
when
a
codi
--
a
codifier
takes
a
prohibition
against
depositing
waste
into
the
river
and
has
the
form
of
prohibition
against
depositing
any
matter
of
any
kind,
whether
it'd
be
waste
or
valuable
matter,
then
the
two
aren't
inconsistent,
we
codified
them
by
including
the
broader
provision
in
this
codification,
he's
not
really
forced
to
any
choice
at
all.
however,
we
contend
that
that
congress
was
forced
to
make
a
choice
between
inconsistent
provisions,
we
submit
it
was
an
offense
in
1899
to
deposit
valuable
matter
into
the
water
and
that
--
and
congress
when
it
shows
not
to
change
that
law,
continued
making
it
an
offense
to
deposit
valuable
matter
into
the
water.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
later
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
1894
statute
is
the
broader
of
the
two.
now,
that
--
we
contend
that
the
word
refuse
must
have
been
intended
to
narrow
the
application
of
the
statute
only
to
valueless
material.
but
we
submit
that
its
entirely
consistent
and
it
makes
very
good
sense
to
read
the
word
refuse
not
as
limiting
the
statute
in
that
way
but
as
limiting
it
to
the
kinds
of
deposits
which
are
enumerating
those
two
statutes,
both
the
1890
and
the
1894
act.
both
of
them
had
a
long
enumeration
of
materials
which
could
not
be
deposited
in
the
water
and
then
concluded
with
general
catch-all
statements
such
as
other
waste
of
any
kind
or
any
other
matter
of
any
kind.
what
the
codifier
did
in
1899
is
he
eliminated
the
enumeration.
but
of
course,
it
was
nonetheless
necessary
to
keep
the
scope
of
the
statute
as
no
broader
than
those
catch-all
phrases
would
have
been
if
construed
as
just
and
generous.
now,
in
other
words,
if
somebody
has
distilled
water
which
he's
throwing
into
the
river,
that
ought
not
to
be
covered
by
the
statute.
and
we
think
that's
why
the
codifier
in
1899
put
the
word
refuse
in
there,
because
he
meant
to
exclude
the
kind
of
things
which
would
not
have
been
covered
had
those
catch-all
phrases
been
read
a
just
and
generous.
and
we
submit
that
the
present
application
in
section
13
to
the
kind
of
gasoline
involved
here
is
entirely
consistent
with
reading
those
statutes
and
their
concluding
phrase
as
prohibiting
the
discharge
of
any
materials
which
would
be
harmful
to
the
water,
things
such
as
refuse,
dirt,
ashes,
acid
and
such
materials
and
not
making
it
a
crime
to
deposit
matters
which
are
not
foreign
to
the
waters
such
as
water
or
if
somebody
would
put
live
fish
into
a
stream
and
these
are
the
sort
of
things
that
congress
was
not
intending
to
make
a
crime
and
that
they
--
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
from
the
scope
of
the
statute
by
putting
the
word
refuse
then.
mr.
nathan
lewin
what
we
think
in
common
usage
mr.
justice
stewart,
refuse
means
garbage,
it
means
that
--
it's
true
that
webster's
dictionary
definition
focuses
on
a
discarded
material.
but
we
think
in
common
use,
it
means
not
only
waste
material
but
garbage.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
a
couple
of
but
right.
but
garbage
in
the
sense
--
well,
i
think
garbage
is
probably
a
relative
term.
it
depends
where
it
is.
a
freight
cart
full
of
diamonds
in
a
river
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
unless
somebody
salvages
them,
this
is
garbage.
mr.
nathan
lewin
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
river,
it's
garbage
and
it's
useless.
and
we
think
that
that
support
is
indeed
by
the
earlier
legislation,
the
1890.
and
the
1894
statutes
indeed
used
the
word
refuse
or
other
waste
of
any
kind
or
used
the
word
--
or
other
refuse
or
mill
waste
apparently
distinguishing
between
refuse
and
waste,
not
the
--
not
intending
to
have
refuse
and
waste
mean
precisely
the
same
thing.
finally,
we
submit
that
the
statute
on
its
face
means
and
means
to
a
careful
reader
of
it
exactly
what
we
say.
there
are
two
portions
to
the
statute.
the
first
provision,
the
first
clause
makes
it
an
offense
to
deposit
or
suffer
the
deposit
of
refuse
matter
of
any
kind
directly
into
the
river.
the
second
is
a
narrower
cause
which
makes
it
an
offense
to
deposit
material
of
any
kind
on
the
bank
of
the
river
if
it's
liable
to
be
washed
into
the
water
and
impede
or
obstruct
navigation.
now
we
submit
that
if
the
district
court
were
right
and
if
the
first
half
of
this
statute
meant
to
apply
only
to
valueless
material,
that's
clearly
not
true
of
the
second
half.
the
second
half
doesn't
have
the
word
refuse.
but
if
the
district
court
were
right,
there
would
be
a
--
an
inexplicable
gap
in
this
law
because
what
section
13
would
be
providing
with
the
--
that
it
would
be
an
offense
to
negligently
deposit
valuable
material
on
the
banks
of
a
river,
from
which
it
could
be
washed
in
to
the
stream,
but
it
would
not
be
an
offense
negligently
to
deposit
the
same
obstructive
material
directly
into
the
stream
if
they're
valuable.
now,
any
as
i
--
as
i
say,
any
careful
reader
of
the
statute
is
bound
to
conclude
that
if
the
second
half
of
the
statute
makes
it
a
crime
negligently,
for
example,
if
you're
driving
pass
the
banks
of
the
river
with
a
--
with
an
open
truck
full
of
logs
which
you're
taking
to
build
the
log
cabin
some
place
and
you
negligently
allowed
the
logs
to
fall
off
the
truck
on
to
the
bank.
and
these
logs
are
likely
to
be
washed
into
the
water
and
obstruct
navigation.
well,
that's
an
offense
under
the
second
half
of
the
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
it
did
drift
along
at
the
docks
and
then
into
the
water.
but
we
think
the
reason
the
second
half
wouldn't
apply
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
the
second
half
is
limited
to
obstructive
matter.
if
the
concluding
clause
is
that
it
applies
to
material
which
whereby
navigation
shall
or
may
be
impeded
or
obstructed
and
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely,
but
we
stipulated
ourselves
out
of
that.
we
agreed
to
the
end
--
the
stipulation
specifically
said
that
this
did
not
construct
any
--
that
this
did
not
constitute
any
impediment
to
navigation
of
any
sort.
but
it
--
at
any
event
this
would
leave
this
big
void
in
the
statute
whereby
returning
to
my
illustration,
if
i
were
driving
fast
with
this
open
truck
of
logs
and
the
logs
fell
directly
onto
the
bank
because
of
my
negligence,
i
would
have
committed
an
offense.
and
yet
if
the
logs
fell
directly
into
the
river
because
of
my
negligence
and
not
on
to
the
docks,
then
i
would
not
have
committed
an
offense.
that
we
think
is
the
kind
of
construction
which
is
--
which
obviously
should
inform
a
careful
reader
of
the
statute
that
valueless
as
well
as
valuable
material
--
valuable
as
well
as
valueless
materials
are
covered
by
the
first
part.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
this
area
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
opposed
to
some
of
the
cases
which
the
appellee
has
cited
there's
really
not
very
much
reliance.
appellee
cited
for
example
cases
in
which
--
particular
illustration
being
that
the
harris
case
in
177
u.s.
in
which
the
statute
was
unclear
as
to
whether
it
imposed
a
certain
duty
on
the
defendants
in
that
case
and
duty
to
have
the
cattle
removed
from
the
train
that
was
carrying
them
from
one
place
to
another
in
water.
but
now,
there
i
think
the
defendants
been
effect
plan
their
conduct
in
accordance
with
their
construction
of
the
statute.
when
--
what
we're
dealing
with
this
negligence
or
on
a
strict
liability,
this
is
far
less
of
this
kind
of
reliance,
in
other
words,
standard
oil
knew
it
was
liable,
knew
it
is
probably
doing
something
responsible
to
itself
by
--
and
possibly
violating
the
statute
when
--
if
any
oil
negligently
or
any
gasoline
negligently
escaped
into
the
water.
and
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
a
reading
the
statute
on
its
face
of
course
are
construction.
and
in
prior
cases,
where
the
very
same
client
was
made
for
example
on
the
wiesenfeld
warehouse
case
in
376
u.s.
this
court
looked
to
the
legislative
history
and
said,
"well,
from
the
legislative
history
would
have
been
clear."
and
here,
we
think
the
legislative
history
could
just
not
have
been
clearer,
that
congress
was
intending
to
encompass
this
kind
of
conduct
as
well
as
the
discharge
of
valueless
and
useful
material.
mr.
nathan
lewin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
like
to
cover
two
--
three
points
that
were
raised
in
the
appellee's
argument.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
the
important
point
with
regard
to
this
statute
that
must
be
recalled
is
that
congress
was
legislating
with
regard
to
what
harmed
river
is.
and
it's
equally
of
harmful
to
rivers
when
injurious
deposits
are
put
in
there
whether
the
owner
personally
wants
them
or
not.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
river
what
the
owner
is
subjective
and
can't
is,
whether
he
wanted
to
throw
it
in
or
whether
it
ended
in
there
negligently.
so
far
as
the
oil
pollution
act
is
concerned,
and
that
was
right,
the
oil
pollution
act
of
1924
applies
only
to
deposits
of
oil
from
ships
into
coastal
waters,
it
wouldn't
cover
this
kind
of
a
deposit.
and
the
problem
at
the
time,
the
reason
that
the
oil
pollution
act
was
passed
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
statute
applied
to
refuse
or
not
but
it
was
because
of
a
limiting
construction
which
we
submit
was
a
misconstruction
of
the
statute.
the
reading
this
refuse
act
is
defined
only
to
obstruct
the
materials
that
the
oil
pollution
act
was
passed
and
that
that
made
entirely
clear
that
ships
in
coastal
waters
were
committing
offenses.
and
of
course,
let
the
refuse
act
and
specifically
did
left
any
other
act
enforced
that
would
apply
to
cover
violations
of
this
sort.
and
mr.
hadlow's
there
repeated
references
to
our
illustrations
regarding
the
sunken
barge,
we
don't
contend
and
didn't
contend
that
that
was
a
violation
of
section
13
because
it
was
entirely
--
insofar
as
we
can
tell
inadvertent
or
an
accident
in
line
with
your
line
of
questions
mr.
chief
justice.
that
illustration
was
put
into
a
footnote
in
our
brief
only
with
reference
to
an
alternative
argument
which
we
made
for
the
construction
of
the
word
refuse.
and
that
construction
was
supported
by
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
by
the
late
judge
learned
hand
and
we
put
the
--
a
reference
in
the
footnote
in
there
to
explain
what
it
would
cover
and
what
it
would
not.
and
finally,
although
--
i
must
say
that
mr.
hadlow
say
that
this
is
a
--
just
a
very
minor
case,
of
course
the
readings
from
prosecution
don't
appear
from
the
record
but
we
contend
that
this
has
to
be
left
to
the
good
sense
of
prosecutors
and
that
there
was
good
cause
in
this
instance
to
proceed
criminally
against
this
discharge
of
valuable
matter
into
navigable
waters.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
but
there
was
good
cause.
