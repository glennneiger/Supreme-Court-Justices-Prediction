mr.
hubert
b.
pair
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
mootness
question.
the
court
of
general
sessions
is
a
court
of
record.
court
shorthand
reporters
are
available
upon
the
request
of
defendants
in
the
criminal
division.
the
court
is
required
under
mandate
of
the
--
our
appellate
courts
to
appoint
counsel
for
criminal
defendants.
the
petitioner
here,
having
been
convicted
of
the
offense
of
vagrancy
could
have
as
we
have
indicated
in
the
memorandum
been
punished
by
a
fine
of
$300
or
imprisoned
for
a
term
of
90
days
or
both.
and
upon
default
in
the
payment
of
the
fine,
he
could
have
under
our
law
imprisoned
for
an
additional
period
of
one
year.
in
our
code,
d.c.
code,
the
1961
edition,
supplement
iv,
and
this
is
not
--
does
not
appear
in
the
record
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
read
it,
it
isn't
too
long
because
it
does
bear
very
substantially
upon
this
mootness
question.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
this
is
not
in
the
brief.
this
goes
to
the
mootness
question.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
we
cited
but
we
did
not
–
of
course
we
were
anxious
to
get
it
in,
we
did
not
quote
it,
but
we
did
cite
the
code
section.
the
section
reads,
“in
criminal
cases
in
the
district
of
colombia
court
of
general
sessions,
the
court
may
upon
convictions
suspend
the
imposition
of
sentence
or
impose
sentence
and
suspend
the
execution
thereof,
for
such
time
and
upon
such
terms
as
it
deems
best
if
it
appears
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
the
ends
of
justice
and
the
best
interest
of
the
public
and
of
the
defendant
would
be
served
thereby.
in
each
case
of
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
the
suspension
of
execution
thereof,
the
court
may
place
the
defendant
on
probation
and
under
the
control
and
supervision
of
a
probation
officer.
the
probationer
shall
be
provided
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
with
a
written
statement
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
this
probation.
at
the
time
when
he
is
placed
thereon,
he
shall
observe
the
rules
prescribed
to
his
conduct
by
the
court
and
report
to
the
probation
officer
has
directed.”
and
then
it
reads,
“a
person
may
not
be
put
on
probation
without
his
consent.”
now,
it
is
undisputed
in
the
record
as
noted
by
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
--
the
sentence
was
--
imposition
of
sentence
was
suspended.
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
any
conditions
were
imposed.
and
since
it
is
our
understanding
with
this
type
of
motion
that
we
often
that
it
can
go
out
of
the
record.
we
represent
to
the
court
that
in
no
instance
have
we've
been
able
to
find
that
following
the
suspension
of
the
imposition
of
sentence,
absent
conditions
imposed
and
the
violation
of
those
conditions,
in
no
instance
have
we've
been
able
to
find
a
case
in
which
a
man
has
been
brought
back
into
the
court
following
the
suspension
of
imposition
of
sentence.
in
fact
the
practice
is
to
in
effect,
tap
the
man
on
the
risk
and
tell
him
to
go
away
and
behave
himself
and
that
is
borne
out
by
the
record
which
indicates
only
the
notation
imposition
of
sentence
suspended.
now,
assuming
before
the
argument
that
they
are
remand
in
the
district
court,
that
we
assume
that
only
for
the
argument,
some
latent
power
to
bring
this
man
back
into
court
in
connection
with
his
judgment
of
conviction.
certainly,
upon
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
period,
about
which
he
could
under
any
circumstance
be
confined
that
there
remains
nothing
upon
which
this
judgment
could
operate.
so
we
submit
to
the
court
on
the
mootness
question
that
this
case
has
in
effect
the
question
which
is
urged
here
as
an
effect
become
purely
academic.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes
mr.
fortas.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no.
i
said
assuming
that
there
remand
in
the
court
and
we
don't
agree
that
any
such
power
remain,
but
just
assuming
that
it
did,
if
there
remain
some
latent
power
in
the
trial
court
to
bring
this
man
back
before
the
court
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
it,
we
say
that
on
--
that's
certainly
on
reason
the
--
there
would
be
no
basis
for
doing
that
after
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
term
for
which
he
could
have
been
sentenced
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
nothing,
justice
fortas
except
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
the
statute
which
had
it's
urged
in
the
1953.
it
did
a
practice,
it
has
grown
up
in
the
criminal
division
to
suspend
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
yet
there
was
no
authority
for
it.
so
in
1953,
at
the
instance
of
the
commissioners,
the
congress
approved
legislation
which
permitted
the
suspension
of
the
imposition
of
sentence.
now,
this
statute
--
and
this
is
on
the
same
point,
defers
substantially
from
the
federal
probation
act.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no
justice
fortas,
i
think
that
they're
consistent.
the
general
statute
that
covers
all
cases,
the
vagrancy
statue
of
course
would
apply
there.
but
the
vagrancy
statue
is
much
more
restrictive
than
the
general
statute
because
--
unless
conditions
are
imposed,
then
of
course
it'd
be
no
condition
to
be
violated
and
then
there
no
circumstances
could
he
brought
back
into
a
court
because
the
vagrancy
statute
certainly
contemplates
that
the
imposition
of
sentence
is
suspended
that
conditions
will
be
imposed
and
upon
violation
of
those
conditions,
a
man
would
be
brought
back
before
the
court.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
don't
think
so
justice
brennan.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no,
not
from
the
language
of
the
statute
but
immediately
preceding
sentence
is
certainly
contemplates
of
the
court
would
impose
conditions
before
it
get
suspended
the
imposition
of
sentence.
and
then
under
the
general
law
which
says
that
no
person
can
be
put
on
probation
without
his
consent.
so
congress
evidently
envisioned
the
situation
such
as
this
where
a
person
did
not
want
to
be
subjected
to
conditions,
that
he
had
preferred
to
take
his
chance
in
the
court
and
perhaps
in
the
appellate
courts
rather
than
submit
to
conditions
which
he
might
feel
would
be
burdensome.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
would
think
that
to
be
implicit,
that
unless
conditions
were
imposed
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
there's
has
been
no
sentence.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes
justice
warren.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no,
justice
--
chief
justice
warren.
i
think
the
court
was
acting
pursuant
and
merely
--
in
suspending
the
imposition
of
sentence,
was
acting
pursuant
to
the
humanitarian
aspects
of
the
general
statute.
the
purpose
of
that
statute
being
to
enable
the
court
to
dispose
of
cases
with
a
warning
relevant
to
impose
the
sentence.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
think
so,
very
definitely
chief
justice
warren.
whenever
there
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
because
i
think
the
empathy
--
because
of
the
expiration
of
the
period
for
which
he
could
have
been
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
because
the
suspension
–
imposition
of
sentence
was
suspended.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no
sentence
was
imposed
but
the
judgment
of
the
court
was
and
that
judgment
remains
undisturbed.
the
judgment
was
that
the
imposition
of
sentence
would
be
suspended.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well,
there's
no
mention
of
any
particular
period.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well,
i
think
he
would
go
by
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well,
certainly
not
longer
than
that
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
there
was
a
man
--
but
not
called
--
this
man
what
bears
on
it
i
think
chief
justice.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
what
i
think
the
answer
to
it
is,
is
in
the
statute
which
the
first
sentence
of
section
16710,
this
is
the
act
of
congress.
the
first
sentence
which
has
to
do
with
the
suspension
of
imposition
of
sentence
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
says
nothing
about
the
execution
and
says
nothing
about
conditions,
the
first
sentence.
but
in
the
second
sentence,
it
does
speak
about
conditions.
now
the
first
sentence
merely
reads
that
if
it
appears
in
the
fact
of
its
--
that
the
ends
of
justice
and
the
best
interest
of
the
public
would
be
served
thereby,
the
court
may
suspend
imposition
of
sentence.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
it
doesn't
say
it.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
would
say
that
it
is
the
imposition
of
sentence
is
suspended
forever.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
conditions
under
which
you
could
bring
him
back
because
absent
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no.
i
think
in
the
first
sentence
to
do
--
to
be
moved
by
humanitarian
considerations
when
the
court
felt
that
the
best
interest
to
the
public
and
of
the
defendant
would
be
served
thereby.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yeah.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
without
condition.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes
justice
brennan,
that
is
our
position.
now
with
respect
to
the
second
sentence,
it
is
otherwise.
i
think
congress
contemplated
there,
that
if
execution
of
a
sentence
was
suspend
or
if
imposition
of
the
sentence
was
suspended
with
conditions,
then
it
would
be
otherwise
set
upon
violation
of
those
conditions,
the
criminal
defendant
could
be
brought
back
before
the
court
and
dealt
with
according
to
law.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
sir
where
does
it
say
that?
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
in
case
of
the
imposition
of
sentence
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
was
reading
the
--
read
on
the
statute?
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
in
the
case
of
the
imposition
of
sentence.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
of
sentence.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
and
the
suspension
of
execution
thereof.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
the
court
may
place
the
defendant
on
probation
under
the
control
and
supervision
of
the
probation
officer.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
the
probationer
shall
be
provided
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
with
a
written
statement
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
his
probation
at
the
time
when
he's
placed
thereof.
he
shall
observe
the
rules,
and
then
a
person
may
not
be
put
on
probation
without
his
consent.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no,
i
think
the
two
statutes
are
entirely
consistent.
i
think
the
general
statute
is
broad
enough
to
cover
all
cases
and
i
think
it's
broad
enough
to
cover
the
case
of
a
present
convicted
under
the
vagrancy
act,
in
effect
congress,
what
it
did
with
respect
to
this
first
sentence,
was
to
enable
the
trial
--
to
empower
the
trial
judge
in
the
criminal
case
to
say
to
a
criminal
defendant
and
the
less
serious
criminal
offenses
to
go
and
send
no
more.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
and
what
have
been
the
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
perhaps
the
language
could
have
been
the
clearer,
but
this
is
a
language
and
it
does
seem
to
be
consistent
that
congress
was
talking
about
two
things.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
that's
correct
justice
brennan.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
and
the
clerk
--
the
clerk
under
the
direction
of
the
trial
judge
affixes
thing
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
this
is
a
practice.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes
sir.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
we
do
not
think
so
justice
fortas
for
this
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
think
it
would
have
been.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
that
is
the
position
and,
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
state
why
it
is
our
position.
in
the
usual
case
when
the
judge
decides
to
suspend
imposition
of
sentence,
this
is
a
ritual.
the
court
will
save
the
--
the
court
suspends
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
will
take
your
personal
bond
not
to
repeat
the
offense.
then
the
defendant
holds
up
his
hand
and
he
is
dismissed,
but
in
that
particularly
instance,
he
has
given
his
bond
not
to
repeat
the
offense
and
if
he
does
repeat
the
offense,
of
course
he
can
be
brought
back
and
be
subjected
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
court.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
great
many
years
ago
and
that
in
substance
as
the
district's
position
on
the
vagrancy
--
i
mean,
on
the
mootness
question.
we
felt
it
–
out
duty
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
we
think
the
question
is
substantial
and
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
think
it
would
be
wiped
out
to
the
--
down
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes,
the
district
suggest
justice
brennan
that
this
question
of
mootness
became
ripe
only
upon
the
exploration,
giving
look
and
that
the
case
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner.
it
became
ripe
only
upon
the
expiration
of
the
--
of
that
--
of
one
year
and
90
day
period.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
about
december
of
1965
--
no,
about
--
that
would--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes.
the
judgment,
if
measured
from
that
date,
it
would
long
–
now
we
were
--
if
given
them
--
given
the
petitioner
of
the
benefit
of
every
possible
doubt
by
dating
the
period
from
the
denial
of
rehearing
en
banc
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
i
think
more
properly,
i
have
--
the
period
should
run
from
the
date
of
the
judgment
--
of
conviction.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no.
i
mean,
90
days
on
that
period.
i
mean
one
year
and
90
days
running
commencing
to
run
on
the
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
1964.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
chief
justice
warren,
i
think
it
would
be,
but
assuming
that
there
remained
some
latent
power
in
the
court
and
i
don't
think
there
remained
in
the
latent
power
under
the
second
stanzas
of
this
particular
case.
had
the
court
taken
this
man's
personal
bond
then
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
mootness
appear
would
commence
to
run
at
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
period
for
which
he
could
have
been
confined.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well,
under
the
procedure
we
have
in
the
--
he
has
--
and
there
has
been
a
case
on
this.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
as
--
we
do
have
a
case
in
the
--
in
our
jurisdiction
in
which
the
right
of
a
criminal
defendant
who
is
sentenced
--
the
imposition
of
sentence
was
suspended.
his
right
to
appeal
was
challenged
on
the
ground
and
there
was
nothing
upon
which
the
judgment
could
operate.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
had
a
right
to
challenge
the
judgment
of
conviction
even
though
the
imposition
of
sentence
had
been
suspended.
now
there
were
peculiar
facts
there
because
they
was
so
serious
moral
charge
involved
and
that
may
have
influenced
the
court
to
its
judgment.
but
what
we
say
is,
that
there
would
be
a
right
to
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
even
though
imposition
of
sentence
had
been
suspended.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes
justice
stewart.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well,
i
said
under
the
peculiar
facts
that
i
perhaps
conceded
too
much,
i
can
see
--
that
say,
i
think
it
is
moot
but
not
subject
to
--
but
not
moot
to
the
point
of
defeating
the
man's
right
to
an
appeal
because
he
did
appeal
and
our
courts
have
said
there
is.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
pardon
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well
certainly,
moot
for
the
purpose
of
--
for
the
purpose
of
the
proceedings
before
this
court.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
it
would
make
sense.
i
think,
i
withdraw
what
i
said
about
the
mootness
from
the
day
to
(voice
overlap).
i
said
i
withdraw
what
i
said
about
the
mootness
dating
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
to
go
back
to
my
other
point
that
we
consider
that
the
--
that
it
would
be
moot
from
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
period
for
which
he
could
have
been
confined.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
but
chief
justice
warren,
i
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
think
it's
an
idle
act.
i
think
the
court
is
doing
exactly
what
the
congress
authorized
to
do
and
what
the
congress
wanted
it
to
do
in
this
peculiar
type
of
case,
that
rather
than
subject
a
person.
and
the
court
would
be
--
perhaps
would
be
required
to
find
him
guilty
or
else
the
court
would
be
guilty
of
administering
an
uneven
justice,
but
the
court
would
not
be
required
to
imprison,
to
punish
him.
if
in
the
interest
to
the
public
and
the
interest
of
the
defendant,
the
court
felt
that
the
best
interest
would
be
served
by
suspending
the
imposition
of
the
sentence.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no
chief
justice
warren.
if
the
court
was
interested
in
keeping
control
of
him
for
30
days,
the
court
would
have
been
impose
sentence
and
suspend
that
the
execution
of
the
sentence
and
then
upon
conditions
and
if
you
violated
the
condition
to
bring
him
back
and
require
him
to
serve
in
30
days.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
don't
know
if
any
authority.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
that
the
trial
court
would
have
to
do
that.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
the
statute
itself
--
the
statute.
the
act
of
congress
itself
authorizes
him
to
do
it
and
the
language
that
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice
is
language
that
which
is
entirely
unambiguous.
it
says
in
clear
language
if
--
if
that
the
--
if
the
ends
of
justice
and
best
interest
of
the
public
and
of
the
defendant
will
be
served
thereby.
now
the
trial
court
evidently
in
his
wisdom
felt
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served
by
telling
this
defendant
to
go
and
say
no
more.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no.
i
think
remand
does
it
prop
--
i
think
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
mean,
recall
it
i
suppose
and
suspend
this
--
not
to
suspend
it
but
to
wipe
it
out
or
to
cause
it
to
be
executed.
to
either,
would
not
to
remand
it
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
this
is
in
the
partition
of
the
brief
and
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
conditions.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well
justice
black,
we
have
two
acts
of
congress,
and
they
are
not
inconsistent.
i
think
the
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
but
we
can
construe
the
--
couldn't
apply
the
other
act
if
there
is
any
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
but
i
think
this
--
i
think
you
could
do
it
this
way
justice
black.
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
the
court
did
what
the
act
authorized
it
to
do,
and
that
is
to
impose
condition.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
am
speaking
of
the
act.
the
act
says,
“the
court
may
impose
conditions
upon
any
person
convicted.”
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
court
impose
any
conditions.
so
therefore,
there
would
be
no
circumstance
under
which
he
could
violate
any
conditions
and
if
he
couldn't
violate
any
condition,
he
couldn't
be
brought
back
before
the
court.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well,
i
think
it'll
be
a
violation
of
due
process
to
bring
him
back
now
and
impose
conditions
upon
him.
while
the
--
at
the
instance
of
a
defendant,
the
sentence
may
be
correct.
i
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well,
this
--
i
think
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
but
that
justice
black,
whatever
was
in
the
mind
of
the
congress
and
subsequently
passing
the
general
statutes,
whatever
doubt
there
may
have
existed
was
removed
by
the
language
and
the
general
statute.
congress
said
specifically
what
the
--
in
criminal
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
of
general
sessions,
what
the
judge
can
do.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
and
even
if
there
was
ambiguity
in
the
vagrancy
act,
and
it
doesn't
appear
to
me,
it
seems
to
be
entirely
consistent
on
any
view
of
this
record
because
no
conditions,
whatever
were
imposed
upon
this
criminal
defendant.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
in
the
less
serious
criminal
offenses,
yes
chief
justice
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well
just
--
i
think
drunk
and
disorderly
cases,
vagrancy
cases,
traffic
cases,
disorderly
conduct
cases,
loitering
cases,
of
that
kind.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes
justice
fortas.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes
justice
fortas.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no.
they
were
conditions
imposed.
the
trial
judges
required
tends
it
all
to
a
probation
officer,
big
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
no,
that
would
be
unofficial
record
made
of
it.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
it
would
be
in
the
criminal
file,
the
terms
of
the
conditions.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i'm
confident
of
that.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
but
not
--
now
what
would
be
and
i
say
would
be
the
notation
take
--
the
court
takes
his
personal
bond,
that
would
be
stamped
on
the
information.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
only
if
conditions
were
imposed.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
but
the
conditions
themselves
would
not
appear
on
the
record.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes,
that
would
--
yes.
and
the
reference
then
would
be
to
the
criminal
file.
now
if
the
court
had
taken
this
personal
bond,
that
would
appear
upon
the
information.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
mootness
matter,
if
i
may
proceed
to
the
--
great
may
years
ago,
this
court
in
the
case
of
forsyth
versus
hammond,
a
case
in
which
a
writ
of
certiorari
had
been
issued,
the
court
was
requested
to
reexamine
the
question
as
a
threshold
matter
and
this
court
said
what
has
influenced
us
in
our
preparation,
the
court
said
there
are
really
two
questions
are
involved;
one
of
propriety
and
one
of
power,
that
with
respect
to
the
question
of
propriety
the
court
said
that
that
should
be
considered
as
foreclosed
because
the
court
has
granted
the
writ.
but
that
with
respect
to
the
question
of
power,
that
question
is
always
open
and
when
raised
there
must
be
considered
and
disposed
off
by
the
court.
so
using
that
case
as
a
guideline
and
other
cases
to
it,
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
of
that
under
no
theory
is
that
jurisdiction
to
review
on
certiorari
this
particular
case
for
several
reasons.
one,
as
has
been
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
and
that
is,
if
this
case
was
not
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
purposes
of
review
on
writ
of
certiorari
and
authority
to
that
of
course
is
the
ferguson
case
and
two,
we
rely
upon
the
house
versus
mayo,
but
not
for
the
reasons
suggested
by
petitioner.
in
the
ferguson
case
of
course
in
which
it
was
sought
to
get
into
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
by
writ
of
error,
the
court
said
that
the
case
was
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
therefore
cannot
be
reviewed.
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
serious
question
in
the
minds
of
petitioner
that
he
is
not
properly
in
the
court
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
12541.
but
we
go
a
step
farther
and
say
that
there
is
no
right
to
review
because
a
petition
was
not
filed
within
the
time
prescribed
by
the
court's
rules.
now
petitioner
first
said
that
if
--
that
his
petition
was
timely
because
it
was
filed
within
30
days
after
the
court
of
appeals
entered
order
vacating
and
reentering
the
order
denying
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
banc.
petitioner
has
apparently
abandoned
that
point
now
because
he
has
said
nothing
further
about
it.
but
insists
that
he
is
--
here,
because
he
is
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
under
the
28th
u.s.c.
1651,
which
confers
upon
the
court's
authority
to
issue
all
writs
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.
we
submit
that
here
being
--
was
no
jurisdiction
to
be
aided,
and
that
even
if
the
petitioner
it
had
preceded
in
the
manner,
proceeded
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
rules
of
the
court
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
review
under
the
extraordinary
writ
section.
and
what
the
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
think
he
is
retreated
to
that
point,
that
was
i
understand
them,
but
i
will
address
myself
to
both
upon
he's
not
properly
here
on
the
ended
theory.
not
here
on
the
12
--
under
28
u.s.c.
125401
because
his
petition
--
i
mean
because
he
is
not
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he's
not
here
under
the
28
u.s.c.
1651,
because
that
writ
may
not
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
established
appeal
procedures
and
that
in
any
event,
the
petition
is
not
filed
within
the
time
prescribed
by
this
rule,
by
the
rules
of
this
court,
the
rules
being
a
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
now
you
honors,
we'll
recall
that
petitioner
first
went
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
saying
in
effect
that
i
have
not
filed
a
petition
within
the
time
you
required
by
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
and
ask
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
would
be
good
enough
to
vacate
and
reenter
its
order,
so
that
the
procedural
defects
could
be
cured
and
so
that
he
could
come
up
to
the
supreme
court.
now
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
require
and
the
language
so
clear
is
to
not
require
a
construction
of
that
the
petition
must
be
filed
within
30
days
and
the
rules
authorize
a
justice
of
the
court
to
extend
the
period
to
an
additional
30-day
period,
but
then
only
if
the
application
for
an
extension
is
made
before
the
expiration
of
the
30-day
period.
it
was
more
than
75
days
after
the
court
of
appeals
denied
rehiring
in
banc,
before
he
went
back
before
the
court
of
appeals.
alright,
so
in
that
court
to
do
indirectly
what
it
had
no
authority
to
do
directly,
saying
in
effect
and
that
is
to
enlarge
the
time
for
filing
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
we
submit
that
that
could
not
be
done.
that
this
court
even
if
it
wanted
to
confer
or
to
relinquish
its
jurisdiction,
insofar
i
mean
to
--
yes,
to
relinquish
its
jurisdiction
or
surrender
its
jurisdiction
so
that
the
rules
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
control
that
it
could
not
do
so.
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
as
we
understand
it
have
the
force
and
effect
to
the
law.
they
were
made
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
in
turn
have
the
force
in
effect
of
law,
and
those
rules
of
criminal
procedures
specifically
provide
that
the
time
within
which
a
petition
--
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
a
criminal
case
maybe
filed
in
the
supreme
court
shall
be
within
such
time
as
prescribed
by
the
rules
of
that
court.
now
unquestionably
the
court
has
authority
to
amend
its
rules,
but
it
has
not
done
so
and
in
the
comparatively
recent
case
of
robinson
--
united
states
versus
robinson,
the
court
said
that
however
desirable
great
of
flexibility,
however
desirably
would
be
to
have
great
of
flexibility
in
this
matter
of
appeals
that
--
that's
for
the
rule
making
process
and
not
the
judicial
decision.
so
we
say
to
the
court
that
--
laid
down
this
--
under
1251
--
28,
1651,
is
that
jurisdiction
to
review
this
case.
now
petitioner
says
one
other
thing
with
respect
to
28,
1651,
and
he
relies
very
strongly
upon
the
case
of
house
versus
mayo
and
i
like
to
say
just
the
word
about
that
case.
in
that
case,
a
motion
was
made
to
the
court
pursuant
to
its
rules
for
leave
to
file
a
petition
of
common
law
writ
of
certiorari.
there
the
petitioner
found
himself
in
this
position.
the
case
originated
in
the
state
court
and
it
came
to
the
district
court
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
denied
the
petition
and
then
dismissed
--
refused
the
issue
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
as
provided
by
law,
the
petitioner
then
sought
from
the
district
court
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
so
that
he
could
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
refused
to
issue
the
certificate.
the
statute
provides
also
that
the
court
of
appeals
or
a
justice
thereof,
may
issue
the
certificate
and
permit
the
appeal.
and
so,
the
petition
that
came
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
saying
in
effect,
“i
tried
to
get
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
in
the
district
court,
they
wouldn't
give
it
to
me.
i
have
a
meritorious
case,
please
allow
me
to
appeal.”
the
circuit
court
would
not
even
consider
the
application
for
a
certificate,
saying
to
the
petitioner
that,
“you
have
no
right
here,
unless
you
are
possessed
of
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
issued
by
the
district
court.”
now
obviously
in
that
type
of
situation,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
refused
to
exercise
jurisdiction
which
the
law
had
conferred
upon
it.
and
traditionally,
the
writ
of
cer
--
the
traditionally
a
writ
of
--
the
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
is
issued
to
compel
a
court,
to
exercise
its
jurisdictions,
just
as
it
has
issued
to
restrain
a
court
from
exceeding
its
jurisdiction.
so
house
versus
mayo
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
situation
but
it's
distinguishable
for
another
reason.
the
case
came
into
the
supreme
court
in
house
versus
mayo
through
courts
of
the
federal
system.
certainly,
a
case
originated
in
the
district
court
and
i
say
originating
there,
although
the
petitioner
must
first
filed
in
the
state
court,
but
for
the
purpose
of
being
--
of
a
procedure
and
the
purpose
of
a
case
in
a
supreme
court,
it
came
by
stages
from
the
district
court
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
then
to
the
supreme
court.
this
case
was
never
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
now
in
a
district
court.
the
case
was
in
the
district
of
colombia
court
of
appeals.
now
it
may
well
be
that
in
time
congress
may
see
fit
to
give
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
a
status
of
the
highest
court
of
state,
but
it
has
not
done
so.
so
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
although
occupying
a
position
comparable
to
the
--
to
that
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
is
not
the
highest
court
of
state.
it
is
not
in
a
court
in
the
federal
system.
it
is
a
court
in
the
municipal
system.
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
congress
has
not
provided
for
a
review
of
its
decisions.
it
is
only
to
say
that
the
congress
had
not
seem
fit
to
provide
for
appeals
of
right
from
decisions
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
is
provided
for
discretionary
review
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
and
it
is
very,
very
interesting
and
this
is
what
happened
in
this
vagrancy
case,
which
has
been
transported
to
this
court
in
a
very
defective
vehicle
because
certainly
this
case
is
not
the
proper
vehicle
to
bring
a
constitutional
question
to
this
court.
the
case
as
been
all
originated
in
the
court
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
general
sessions.
there
was
an
appeal
of
right
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
and
it
affirmed
the
decision
on
the
authority
of
prior
decisions
of
that
court,
which
had
construed
the
very
section
of
the
vagrancy
act
which
is
here
involved.
mainly,
this
case
as
i
mention
on
the
brief
rogers
case
and
the
davenport
case
and
both
cases
of
the
act
withstood
assaults
against
it
on
constitutional
grounds.
so
in
this
case,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
on
the
authority
of
prior
decisions
affirmed
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
this
is
most
interesting.
the
court
of
appeals,
circuit
court
of
appeals
the
highest
court
in
this
jurisdiction,
the
court
which
this
court
looks
to,
have
found
decisions
on
questions
of
local
law
review
of
the
record,
such
record
as
the
petition
sought
it
to
bring
that.
and
first
stated,
the
issue
of
that
court
and
then
the
entire
court
after
the
most
careful
and
deliberate
consideration,
did
not
find
sufficient
merit
on
the
constitutional
claims
to
warrant
it
and
allowing
an
appeal.
so
what
do
we
have
standing?
we
have
standing
a
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
remains
undisturbed.
it
is
suggested
by
petitioner
here
that
this
court
might
bypass
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
notwithstanding
the
statutory
scheme
reach
down
and
bring
up
to
it,
the
record
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
but
petitioner
did
not
even
ask
to
their
writ
even
assuming
and
we
don't
think
the
writ
would
issue
to
that
court,
but
there
has
been
no
effort
to
have
the
reach
--
writ
extend
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
so
we
say
that
if
there
is
anything
to
be
reviewed
by
this
court,
it
is
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
denying
discretionary
review.
the
point
has
not
been
briefed,
all
that
has
been
said
or
said,
is
that
the
court
abused
its
discretion
because
it
did
not
allow
an
appeal.
but
petitioner
overlooks
that
fact,
that
in
denying
an
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
exercised
the
very
jurisdiction
that
congress
had
imposed
upon
it.
it
did
the
very
thing
that
congress
authorized
it
to
do,
because
congress
said
that
in
addition
to
other
jurisdiction
which
this
court
has,
it
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
review
cases,
judgments
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
and
then
the
congress
says,
provided
machine
report
by
a
petition
for
allowance
of
an
appeal.
and
if
the
petition
is
granted
congress
said,
“then
the
court
shall
review
the
record
and
shall
affirm,
reverse
or
make
whatever
disposition
which
is
just
and
proper.”
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
it
is
a
court
of
record.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
they
could
have
been
furnished
and
this
is
a
practice.
in
cases
--
stenographic
report
is
not
made
of
all
cases.
absent
a
stenographic
report,
the
statute
provides
where
statement
of
proceedings
and
evidence,
the
appellant,
that
is
a
person
complaining
of
a
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
general
sessions
has
an
appeal
of
right.
he
files
a
statement
of
errors,
a
designation
of
record
and
a
proposed
statement
of
proceedings
and
evidence
that
is
served
upon
the
opposite
party.
if
there
are
objections
to
the
statement
of
proceedings
and
evidence,
the
objection
is
stated.
then
the
act
provides
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
there
was
a
statement,
an
agreed
statement.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
agreed
statement.
the
statute
provides
to
you
for
statement
of
proceedings
and
evidence
approved
by
the
trial
judge
or
an
agreed
statement.
a
reasons
of
his
own
petitioner
elected
to
proceed
by
an
agreed
statement
and
that
is
all
that
we
have
here,
so
that
there
was
ample
room
and
ample
authority
to
provide
the
most
minute
records
of
all
that
transpired
in
the
court
of
general
sessions.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
yes.
i
want
--
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question,
we
think
that
we
can
sum
it
up
this
way.
the
highest
court
in
this
jurisdiction,
that
is
passing
upon
the
question,
has
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
there
is
no
in
the
record
and
there
has
been
no
judgment
by
the
highest
court
in
this
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
no
judgment
respect
from
the
constitutionality
of
the
district
of
columbia
vagrancy
act.
so
all
that
we
have
here
is
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
on
the
authority
of
prior
decisions
of
that
court.
the
district
relies
upon
the
decisions
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
and
we
have
made
no
extended
--
the
argument
on
the
point,
for
the
reason
which
had
been
indicated
and
for
the
further
reasons
that
we
know
of
nothing
further
that
we
can
add
except
to
say
that
the
act
is
sufficiently
--
a
definite
and
precise
to
withstand
any
constitutional
assault,
to
persons
of
reasonable
intelligence,
know
when
that
conduct
is
immoral,
there
are
words
that
can
be
understood
by
all
who
can
read,
a
person
knows
when
he
is
guilty
of
--
when
he
is
living
a
profligate
life.
it
is
an
even
the
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well
(voice
overlap)
it
would
--
difference
or
whether
the
conduct
is
obscene
and
this
court
has
passed
upon
that
question
that
it's
susceptible
to
understanding
by
reasonable
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
beg
your
--
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
i
would
define
immoral
as
a
--
the
district
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
davenport
case
which
counsel
has
spelled
out
in
the
record.
i
couldn't
add
to
it,
justice
black.
mr.
hubert
b.
pair
well
that's
very
true,
that
was
a
specification
of
the
charge.
and
i
would
have
to
go
out
of
the
record
to
actually
describe
to
the
court
exactly
what
was
happened
here.
that
i
think
it's
sufficient
giving
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
general
session
and
court
of
appeals
--
i
mean
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
the
presumption
of
validity
that
it
was
based
upon
evidence
sufficient
to
sustain
it
and
that
the
prosecution
was
under
an
act
sufficiently
definite
and
precise,
so
that
to
serve
as
a
guide
to
future
conduct.
we
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
beg
the
court,
that
on
this
record
the
one
that
there
is
no
jur
--
the
case
is
moot
and
if
it
is
not
moot,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
review
it
on
writ
of
certiorari,
i
don't
think
it
was
improvidently
granted
and
that
in
any
of
that,
if
the
court
finds
that
notwithstanding
these
what
we
consider
procedural,
serious
procedural
defects
here,
that
a
judgment
here
to
be
--
if
then
it
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
