justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wolfram.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
call
your
attention
to
the
transcript
at
record
page
6,
page
5
and
6.
at
page
6
under
the
heading
of
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment,
there
is
set
forth
certain
facts
which
i
read
as
a
rule
purporting
to
relate
to
this
case.
this
is
a
motion
to
set
aside
the
finding
of
guilty
and
dismiss
for
new
trial
on
motion
for
the
arrest
of
judgment
which
you
as
counsel
for
mr.
hicks
filed.
and
on
page
6
as
i
stated,
there
is
set
forth
certain
statements
which
i
would
construe
as
a
description
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
did
you
so
intend
them?
justice
abe
fortas
you
still
believe
them
to
be
true.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
not
--
this
was
not
a
verified
plead,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no
verification
shows
on
the
record
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
second
thing
if
you
don't
mind,
second
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
about
--
it
appears
in
the
statute
involved
here
on
page
60
of
your
brief,
brief
for
petitioner,
the
white
document.
and
if
you
will
look
at
22-3304
and
it
is
set
forth
there,
you
will
see
that
it
states
some
fact
that
the
court
may
suspend
the
imposition
or
execution
of
the
sentence
for
such
period
as
the
court
may
direct
and
the
court
may
and
or
before
the
expiration
of
such
period
remand
such
sentence
or
cause
it
to
be
executed.
now
i
take
it
that
it
is
your
position
and
please
correct
me
if
this
is
wrong,
your
position
that
at
least
in
this
case,
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
impose
a
sentence,
couldn't
be
exercised
at
anytime
hereafter.
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
addressing
myself
to
mootness
point.
justice
abe
fortas
now
as
i
look
at
the
actual
order
entered
by
the
court
as
set
forth
in
the
transcript
of
record
it
does
not
appear
that
the
trial
judge
fixed
any
period
whatever
within
which
period
might
be
suspended
--
justice
abe
fortas
-–
in
which
the
imposition
of
sentence
might
be
suspended.
in
other
words,
say,
trial
judge
ordered
here
that
the
imposition
of
sentence
shall
be
suspended
and
did
not
express
by
the
time,
is
it
your
understanding?
justice
abe
fortas
but
nevertheless
it
--
and
despite
the
language
of
the
statute
is
it
your
contention
here
as
related
to
the
mootness
point
that
the
power
of
the
judge
here
to
impose
sentence
continues
indefinitely
time
without
in.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
doesn't
quite
do
it,
does
it
because
it
going
to
take
us
few
days
to
decide
this
case
anyway.[laughter]
justice
abe
fortas
you
haven't
raised
the
constitutional
question
with
respect
to
that
probation
of
the
statute
if
it
has
the
effect
that
you
think
it
has.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
pair.
justice
abe
fortas
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
so
nothing
is
the
statute
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
[inaudible]
one
of
those
statute
is
the
vagrancy
statue
with
which
we're
here
concerned
and
i
think
there's
a
similar
provision
in
the
statue
on
prostitution
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
and
i
think
those
have
been
on
the
statue
books
for
a
while.
now
the
general
statute
to
which
you
refer
was
enacted
in
--
first
enacted
in
1953,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
view
that
the
general
statute
supersedes
the
special
provisions
in
the
vagrancy
statute
and
the
prostitution
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
statute
doesn't
govern
here
about
the
vagrancy
statute
which
covers
the
same
ground
covered
here,
is
that
what
you
told
me
earlier,
did
i
misunderstand
you.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
pair?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
it's
so
important
for
us
to
understand
this
situation.
let
us
suppose
an
another
case
that
a
man
and
let's
called
mr.
hicks,
is
precisely
the
same
situation
there,
and
gone
right
back
to
dupont
circle
and
had
played
his
guitar
and
been
unshaven,
and
unbewelled
and
whatever
else
mr.
hicks
did,
and
it
he'd
been
arrested
and
brought
into
court.
now
as
you
construe
this
statute,
the
vagrancy
statute,
and
the
sentence
in
this
case,
record
in
this
case,
would
it
then
have
been
possible
for
the
judge
to
impose
a
sentence
on
him
not
only
for
the
second
crime
of
vagrancy
but
also
for
the
first
crime
of
vagrancy
pursuant
to
this
power
that
the
judge
reserved.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
would
have
been
unlawful?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
the
position
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
pair.
justice
abe
fortas
when
the
--
there
are
instances
that
which
shown
to
the
vagrancy
statute,
the
judge
does
impose
conditions,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
those
appear
on
the
record
inquiry
as
a
matter
of
the
way
that
court
is
run
or
do
they
just
take
the
form
of
a
lecture
which
to
the
person
who
is
convicted?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
not
--
let's
talk
about
vagrancy
now.
if
we'd
look
--
so
let's
suppose
the
judge
in
this
case
had
said
to
mr.
hicks,
“i'm
not
going
to
impose
sentence
which
you
to
use
“you
going
to
send
no
more
or
don't
loiter
around
dupont
circle.”
would
you
expect
to
find
that
on
the
official
record
or
wouldn't
that
just
be
this
rubber
stand?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
from
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
feel
confident
about
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
unless
--
