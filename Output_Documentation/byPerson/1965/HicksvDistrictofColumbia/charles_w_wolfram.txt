mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
may
it
please
the
court.
on
june
12,
1963,
petitioner
eddie
j.
hicks
was
convicted
in
the
court
of
general
sessions,
criminal
division
of
the
district
of
columbia
of
the
crime
of
vagrancy.
the
particular
subsection
of
the
district
of
columbia
vagrancy
statute
on
which
he
was
convicted
provides
that
a
vagrant
is
one
who
is
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.
at
his
trial
and
at
every
step
in
the
appellant
procedure,
petitioners
contented
that
the
words
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life
are
unconstitutionally
vague.
he
made
this
argument
first
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
the
local
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
in
a
decision
affirmed
the
judgment
and
rejected
the
constitutional
argument.
as
required
by
the
district
of
columbia
code
petitioner
next
applied
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
seeking
a
petition
for
allowance
of
an
appeal
to
that
court.
the
three-judge
division
of
that
court
appointed
to
sit
on
the
petition,
denied
the
petition
by
a
vote
of
two-to-one.
petitioner
next
petitioned
the
court
en
banc
for
petition
for
allowance
of
an
appeal.
the
entire
court,
voting
three-to-six,
denied
the
petition
for
reconsideration
on
en
banc.
subsequently,
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
and
it
was
granted
in
february
of
this
year.
there's
only
one
substantial
question
presented
in
this
proceeding
as
there's
been
only
one
substantial
question
presented
anywhere
in
it,
whether
subsection
3
of
the
vagrancy
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
indifferent
--
indefinite.
on
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes
i
am,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
don't
think
that
the
government's
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
requires
any
argument.
personally,
if
there's
argument
request,
of
course
i'll
address
myself
to
it.
on
this
petition
for
certiorari,
three
questions
have
been
raised
which
go
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
or
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
hear
the
case.
the
first
one
involves
the
timeliness
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
district
of
columbia
has
attempted
to
show
that
since
the
petition
was
not
filed
within
the
30
days
called
for
by
rule
22,
paragraph
2
of
the
rule
of
this
court,
this
court
does
not
possess
the
power
to
hear
the
case.
this
is
clearly
wrong.
haplin
versus
the
united
states
cited
in
our
reply
brief
quite
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
rules
of
this
court
can
be
waived
by
the
court
in
an
appropriate
case.
there
is
no
jurisdictional
statute
involved.
no
acts
of
congress
provides
the
time
within
which
a
criminal
case
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
is
to
be
brought
to
the
supreme
court.
rule
22,
paragraph
2
is
the
only
provision
setting
out
the
time
limitation.
i
took,
by
the
grant
of
certiorari,
that
this
question
had
been
considered
by
the
court
and
that
the
court
have
decided
in
its
discretion
to
waive
the
requirements
of
rule
22
because
of
the
unusual
circumstances
presented
in
the
petition
and
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes
it
was,
(voice
overlap)
--
the
opposition
for
--
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
did
bring
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no,
there
wasn't.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
it
was
put
an
issue
to
the
extent
that
the
respondent
argued
the
case
and
briefed
it
fully
in
their
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes,
there
was
an
opposition.
there
was
a
reply
to
the
opposition.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes
sir.
the
second
point
presented
by
respondent
involves
the
statutory
foundation
for
the
exercise
of
this
court's
power
to
issue
a
writ
of
certiorari.
if
one
reads
section
1254,
paragraph
1
of
the
judicial
code,
one
would
quite
clearly
think
that
this
case
is
properly
here.
it
provides
that
the
supreme
court
may
review
by
writ
of
certiorari,
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
i
would
have
thought
so
myself.
however,
in
1927,
this
court
in
the
memorandum
decision
in
ferguson
versus
the
district
of
columbia
decided
that
the
words
in
the
court
of
appeals
means
that
the
court
below
have
accepted
the
appeal
where
it
is
presented
to
it
in
a
discretionary
nature.
in
ferguson,
which
was
much
like
this
case,
the
petitioner
reply
to
the
united
states
would
be
equivalent
then
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
was
denied
discretionary
review.
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
founded
under
the
predecessor
section,
the
section
1254
and
the
court,
although
not
presented
with
any
opposition
by
the
district
of
columbia
and
although
the
point
wasn't
argued
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
decided
that
section
1254
(1)
did
not
apply
to
this
case.
a
subsequent
case
house
v.
mayo
has
explained
that
the
court
in
ferguson
was
of
the
belief
that
the
words
in
the
court
of
appeals
mean
that
that
court
have
considered
the
case
on
the
merits.
i
think
the
case
is
wrong,
but
i
don't'
think
it
need
be
overruled
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
in
any
event.
sections
1651
(a),
the
all
writ
section,
as
the
court
well-knows
gives
this
court
the
power
to
issue
all
writs
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
properly
granted
the
petition
for
allowance
of
appeal
when
it
had
the
opportunity,
then
section
1254
would
apply.
it
did
not
grant
the
petition
for
allowance
from
the
appeal,
that
refusal
to
grant
the
petition
was
erroneous.
the
question
is,
whether
that
erroneous
denial
of
the
petition
for
allowance
of
appeal
effectively
precludes
this
court
from
hearing
the
case
on
the
merits,
clearly
not.
there
are
several
cases
in
the
official
reports
involving
just
such
a
situation.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
the
refusal
was
erroneous
for
several
reasons.
the
largest
reason
in
my
mind
is
because
an
obvious,
an
important
and
substantial
question
of
constitutional
law
was
presented
to
the
court.
i
think
in
that
sort
of
a
situation,
the
court
should
exercise
its
discretion
only
under
the
most
extreme
circumstances
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
they
are
obliged
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
case.
we
concede
that
there
is
a
measure
of
jurisdiction
in
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
excuse
me,
discretion
--
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
decide
what
cases
they
will
review
when
they
are
presented
on
the
petition
for
allowance
of
appeal.
we
contend
however
that
there
are
certain
cases
which
are
so
important
where
the
issue
is
so
clear
and
where
the
outcome
is
so
obvious
that
the
refusal
of
the
petition
for
allowance
of
appeal
is
erroneous
and
can
be
reviewed
by
this
court
under
the
all
writ
section.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
must
have
been
spoke
in
my
description
of
the
ferguson
case.
ferguson
was
under
section
1254
(1),
the
predecessor
1254
(1).
we
are
here
under
1651
(a),
the
all
writ
section.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
the
very
purpose
of
section
1651
(a)
as
explicated
in
many
cases
is
to
correct
an
erroneous
refusal
of
a
lower
court
to
hear
a
case
on
the
merits.
such
a
case
was
house
v.
mayo.
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
the
district
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
quite
right.
under
125
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
now
ferguson
can
be
right
and
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
under
section
1254
(1)
if
the
court
of
appeals
have
done
what
it
should
have
done,
issued
the
petition
for
allowance
from
an
appeal,
but
for
the
erroneous
refusal
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
hear
the
case,
the
court
could
properly
hear
it
under
1254.
it's
our
position
that
the
erroneous
refusal
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
hear
the
case
shouldn't
preclude
this
court
from
exercising
jurisdiction
which
should
otherwise
would
have.
again,
such
a
case
was
house
v.
mayo
where
the
petitioner
had
in
the
district
court
applied
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
writ
was
denied.
he
applied
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
under
2253
of
the
judicial
code.
this
was
denied
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
since
the
case
was
never
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
court
in
house
v.
mayo
stated
section
1254
did
not
apply.
however,
they
did
bring
the
case
here
under
a
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
under
1651
(a)
noting
specifically
that
the
purpose
of
1651
(a)
was
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
just
such
a
case.
i
think
house
v.
mayo
is
indistinguishable
and
principle
on
these
facts
from
this
case.
i
think
it
sets
out
a
clear
foundation
for
the
exercise
of
this
court's
discretionary
power
under
1651
(a).
the
third
point
raised
by
respondent
in
order
to
preclude
this
court
in
considering
the
case
on
the
merits
involves
the
obvious
fact
that
there
are
no
evidentiary
facts
of
the
record
--
in
the
record
in
this
case.
respondent
then
in
his
brief
cites
cases
which
quite
properly
hold
that
the
absence
of
facts
from
a
record
will
in
many
circumstances
cause
the
court
to
refuse
to
consider
a
constitutional
question.
we
recognize
this
point
of
law
is
quite
proper
in
those
cases.
however,
those
cases
are
not
like
this
one.
this
case
involves
an
attack
upon
a
statute
on
its
face
not
as
applied.
an
attack
on
its
face
is
almost
necessarily
required
where
the
argument
is,
that
the
statute
is
void
for
vagueness
because
the
very
force
of
the
argument
is
that
no
one
can
know
whether
or
not
the
statute
applies
to
him
and
if
this
violates
due
process.
now,
the
facts
of
the
record
--
of
record
are
obviously
irrelevant
to
an
argument
of
this
nature.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
evidence
showed
below,
the
argument
is
that
the
statute
didn't
give
the
man
the
information
he
needed
beforehand
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
crime
was
about
to
be
committed.
this
distinctness
is
quite
clearly
recognized
in
the
case
of
--
the
cases
i've
cited,
united
states
versus
petrillo
and
quoted
from
it.
i
think
the
quotation
from
the
court
--
from
that
opinion
in
our
reply
brief
to
show
the
court
quite
clearly
why
the
absence
of
facts
from
the
record
is
no
impediment
at
all
to
its
consideration
of
the
case
on
the
merit.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
don't
believe
there
is.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes,
i
think
it's
fichus.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
the
argument
as
i
can
reconstruct
it
from
the
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
is
that
since
the
maximum
penalty
which
can
be
imposed
for
violation
of
the
vagrancy
statute
is
a
sentence
of
90
days
and
$300
and
since
the
most
that
a
person
can
be
in
prison
for,
for
failure
to
pay
a
fine
is
one
year
and
since
the
sum
of
90
and
one
year
is
15
months,
that
the
case
becomes
moot
after
15
months.
i
don't
understand
it.
if
i
do
understand
that
that
way
is
suspicious
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
the
sentence
was
imposition
of
sentence
suspended.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
which
is
in
effect
a
conviction
to
sentencing
a
man
through
indefinite
probation.
the
effect
of
this
--
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
as
i
understand
the
imposition
of
sentence
suspended
type
of
sentence,
this
means
that
if
at
any
time
in
the
future,
15
months
or
15
years
in
the
future,
the
man
is
again
brought
before
the
court,
the
court
can
at
that
time
impose
sentence.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
think
that's
kind
--
quite
clearly
can
be
done
under
the
district
of
columbia
code
provisions.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
he
has
stated
an
opposite
rule
of
law
(voice
overlap)
he
has
not
attempted
to
substantiate
it.
i
don't
think
he
can.
i
know
he
can't.
i
know
it's
not
true.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no,
i
don't.
i
didn't
see
the
memorandum
until
late
last
night.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
he
cites
massachusetts
v.
mullen
and
other
case
--
mellon
and
other
cases
for
the
proportion
that
the
court
will
not
hear
moot
cases.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
have
not
read
them.
i
don't
know
what
they
hold.
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
they
hold
anything
to
the
contrary
of
our
position
on
mootness
one.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
believe
is
new
york
city
at
the
present
time.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes,
he
has.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
believe
he's
moved
to
new
york.
he
comes
to
the
district
of
columbia
periodically.
he
was
here
most
recently
three
or
four
months
ago.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
think
not.
i
don't
think
that
he
should
be
required
to
stay
out
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
order
to
avoid
raising
the
legal
issue
whether
or
not
he
can
be
sentenced
under
this
--
the
sentence
is
now
two
years
old.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no,
he
couldn't.
i
don't
think.
no,
of
course
i
did
have
to
be
before
the
court
for
sentencing.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
that's
right.
the
merits
of
the
case
which
this
court
can
and
should
consider
involved
as
i've
mentioned
the
constitutionality
of
subsection
3
of
the
district
of
columbia
vagrancy
statute.
the
vagrancy
subsection
in
question
provides
that
the
following
classes
of
persons
shall
be
deemed
vagrants
in
the
district
of
columbia.
“any
person
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life
who
has
no
lawful
employment
and
who
has
no
lawful
means
of
support
realized
from
the
lawful
occupation
or
sorts.”
our
argument
revolves
around
the
words
“leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.
”
we
are
not
picking
the
statute
apart.
section
22-3304
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
provides
that
in
a
prosecution
for
vagrancy
under
subsection
3,
the
burden
shall
be
upon
the
defendant
to
prove
that
he
has
lawful
employment
or
has
a
lawful
source
of
income,
so
that
all
the
district
of
columbia
need
prove
in
order
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
vagrancy
under
subsection
3
is
that
the
defendant
was
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.
in
our
brief
we
have
cited
cases
we
still
hold.
so
in
other
words,
our
attack
is
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
prima
facie
crime
as
statutorily
defined
of
vagrancy.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes,
there
is
a
record
--
the
record
was
final.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
the
record
does
not
contain
a
transcription
of
the
evidence
upon
which
petitioner
was
convicted
in
the
court
below.
there
was
no
transcript
made.
there
never
is
and
please
courts
or
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
general
session.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no,
it's
not.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
wasn't
at
the
trial,
i
don't
know.
i've
heard
second
hand,
third
hand.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes,
there
has.
davenport,
the
district
of
columbia
cited
in
our
brief
and
discussed
at
some
length
is
probably
the
most
important
case.
i'll
get
to
that.
so
in
other
words,
by
force
of
section
22-3304,
the
only
question
is
whether
the
defendant
was
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.
the
other
elements
of
the
offense
must
be
established
or
disestablished
by
defendant
in
order
to
disapprove
the
crime
of
vagrancy.
as
you
might
imagine,
in
the
police
court,
the
defendant's
not
come
unprepared
with
witnesses
and
proof
to
prove
that
they
have
lawful
employment
or
lawful
source
of
income
in
most
cases.
so,
the
proof
of
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life
will
suffice
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
for
a
conviction.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
we
have
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
our
main
brief
--
list
of
the
vagrancy
statute
of
all
the
states
and
those
i
believe,
there
are
eight
states
specifically
which
have
statutory
provision
somewhat
like
this.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no,
we
haven't
been
able
to
research
the
vagrancy
ordinances
[inaudible]
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
really
have
no
idea,
i
rather
doubt
it.
because
most
of
the
states
have
state
enactments
and
most
of
the
convictions
are
brought
in
under
the
state
statute
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
unless
the
courts
of
the
states
which
have
these
enactments
have
done
a
better
job
of
limiting
them
so
as
to
make
them
intelligible,
i
would
think
that
the
ruling
in
this
case
would
apply
to
those
court
--
those
statutes,
yes
sir.
i
take
no
discomfort
from
the
fact
that
there
are
states
with
other
--
with
statues
much
like
this.
they've
never
been
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds.
they've
never
been
determined
--
their
constitutionality
has
ever
been
determined
by
this
court
or
by
any
other
court.
the
doctrine
that
we
are
invoking
to
show
the
unconstitutionality
of
subsection
3
is
one
very
familiar
to
this
court.
the
doctrine
of
void
for
vagueness
which
has
been
so
well
explained
by
a
professor
in
amsterdam
in
his
article
in
the
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review.
the
foundation
of
the
doctrine
is
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause.
due
process
as
this
court
sees
it
requires
that
citizens,
the
police
and
the
courts
be
given
sufficient
guidance
by
penal
statutes
so
that
conduct
which
is
prohibited
and
conduct
which
is
permitted
is
with
some
degree
of
precision
separated
and
distinguished.
this
is
obviously
a
task
of
weighing
the
merits
of
individual
language
in
each
individual
case
and
for
that
reason,
cases
involving
other
attacks
on
other
statutory
language
are
not
directly
applicable.
one
of
the
considerations
in
determining
whether
a
statute
is
void
for
vagueness
is
whether
it
has
a
long
history.
a
history
in
which
might
lend
it
precision
which
isn't
apparent
in
the
face
of
the
statute
as
it
usually
a
determination
made
an
economic
criminality.
but
assuming
it
can
be
made
in
personal
criminality,
i
think
that
the
history
of
vagrancy
statues
generally
and
the
specific
history
of
the
district
of
columbia
vagrancy
statute
demonstrate
only
one
thing
that
vagrancy
statues
are
purposely
drawn
as
broadly
as
possible
so
that
the
police
can
sweep
within
the
net
of
the
vagrancy
statute
all
those
who
are
vaguely
undesirable
and
who
the
police
wish
to
place
under
detention
or
who
wish
they
--
whom
they
wish
to
punish
for
some
reason.
they
find
their
origins,
vagrancy
statues
find
their
origins
in
the
fore
laws
of
medieval
england.
those
were
economic
regulations
and
that
suppressing
the
poor,
keeping
them
within
the
enclosed
to
states,
preventing
them
from
moving
abut
england
to
seek
higher
wages
and
better
employment.
they
found
their
way
into
this
country
as
part
of
the
common
law.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
earlier
statutes
specifically
applicable
to
the
district
as
a
whole
that
we've
been
able
to
find
was
the
act
of
1892.
that
act
did
not
in
so
many
words
mention
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.
it
did
mention
in
its
reenactment
in
1898,
a
category
of
a
person
as
described
as
all
suspicious
persons.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
1900
in
the
case
of
stoutenburg
v.
frasier,
struck
down
this
part
of
the
statute
as
unconstitutional
on
the
grounds
among
others
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
however,
the
statute
remained
on
the
books
as
reenacted
in
1909
until
the
modifications
of
the
vagrancy
statutes
in
1941.
the
enactment
of
1909
by
the
way
was
the
first
time
that
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life
appeared
in
the
district
of
columbia
vagrancy
statute.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
1909.
there
were
five
attempted
prosecutions
which
are
preserved
in
appellant
records
under
the
acts
of
1892,
1898,
and
1909,
the
most
recent
of
which
occurred
in
the
1920s.
all
five
cases
resulted
in
reversals,
only
the
stoutenburg
case
it
is
true
went
off
unconstitutional
grounds,
the
other
four
went
off
on
the
grounds
of
the
facts
shown
the
record
do
not
demonstrate
to
the
crime
of
vagrancy
had
been
committed.
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia,
the
appellate
courts
were
quite
zealous
in
making
sure
that
such
a
broad
statute
wasn't
used
to
impinge
upon
the
rights
of
citizens.
the
statute
mainly
went
unused
until
1941,
when
congress
disturbed
by
the
growing
number
of
what
they
considered
undesirable
people
in
the
district
of
columbia
sought
to
have
the
statute
recodified
and
cast
a
new
language.
unfortunately,
in
subsection
3,
they
preserved
the
language
which
has
been
introduced
in
1909
of
defining
a
vagrant
is
a
person
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.
other
subsections
defined
other
types
of
vagrancy.
one
of
these
types
was
also
carried
over
from
the
language
of
the
1909
and
earlier
acts
and
described
the
vagrant
as
an
idle
person,
just
as
an
idle
person.
on
the
bill
after
passage
by
those
houses,
went
to
the
white
house.
president
roosevelt
vetoed
the
vagrancy
bill
on
the
grounds
that
the
words
“all
idle
persons”
were
not
within
what
he
considered
to
be
permissible
limitations
of
statutory
language.
he
did
not
address
himself
to
subsection
3.
after
veto,
the
bill
went
back.
it
was
modified
because
the
lead
references
to
all
idle
persons,
unfortunately
not
to
persons
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
lives
and
in
that
posture
it
was
passed.
significantly,
the
last
section
of
the
bill
as
finally
enacted
is
found
today
in
section
22-3306
and
it
provides
that
nothing
in
the
vagrancy
statutes
shall
be
taken
to
make
criminal,
picketing
or
other
labor
organization
activities.
i
think
the
inclusion
of
this
exclusion
is
highly
significant.
the
memories
of
a
highly
vocal
lobby
in
congress
obviously
saw
that
language
as
loose
as
persons
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life
might
very
well
be
used
by
unsympathetic
prosecutors
and
judges
to
disrupt
the
labor
movement.
they
were
tenet
to
this
and
had
to
put
into
the
statute
a
specific
disclaimer
of
coverage
over
labor
activities.
unfortunately,
the
poor
without
lobby
went
there
and
have
their
exclusions
put
in.
and
mr.
hicks
and
others
like
him
have
been
convicted
since
1941
on
numerous
cases
of
leading
immoral
or
profligate
lives.
under
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine,
another
important
consideration
is
whether
the
courts
of
a
jurisdiction
responsible
for
the
statute
have
in
their
appellant
process
to
find
it
with
any
greater
precision
in
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
possesses.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
there
have
been
a
number
of
appellate
decisions
on
the
wording
“leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.”
the
most
important
of
these
is
davenport
versus
the
district
of
columbia.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
local
court
of
appeals,
held
that
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life
was
to
be
defined
by
reference
to
webster's
second
international
dictionary.
not
surprisingly,
the
definitions
of
moral
and
profligate,
as
viewed
in
webster's
second
international
dictionary
and
another
dictionaries,
the
citations
to
which
and
the
quotations
from
which
appear
in
appendix
to
our
brief,
are
just
about
as
broad
and
amorphous
as
you
might
wish.
to
get
the
full
force
of
exactly
how
amorphous,
i
would
like
to
read
briefly
from
the
definition
given
by
the
court
in
davenport
versus
the
district
of
columbia.
the
court
said,
“webster's
dictionary
defines
profligate
as
completely
given
up
to
dissipation
and
licensciousness,
broken
down
in
morals
and
decency.”
the
court
says,
“it
has
been
said
that
immorality
is
not
necessarily
confined
to
matters
sexual
in
their
nature.
it
may
be
that
which
is
contra
bonos
mores
or
not
moral,
inconsistent
with
rectitude,
purity,
or
good
morals
contrary
to
conscience
or
moral
law,
wicked,
vicious,
licenseless
as
an
immoral
man
[inaudible].”
its
synonyms
are
corrupt,
indecent,
depraved,
dissolute
and
its
antonyms
are
decent,
upright,
good
and
right.
it's
submitted
that
any
penal
offense
defined
in
terms
of
be
good
and
be
right
is
no
penal
statute
at
all.
i
don't
think
anyone
at
all
can
be
expected
to
know
what
a
man
has
to
do,
what
he
can't
do
in
order
to
make
sure
that
he
doesn't
come
within
this
sweep
of
such
a
penal
statute.
davenport
stands
alone
i
think,
in
all
the
cases
decided
under
the
--
decided
in
an
attempt
to
give
more
precision
to
statutes,
penal
statutes,
which
have
gone
so
far
to
broaden
language,
which
is
already
impossibly
broad.
i
think
the
problem
is
especially
acute
because
convictions
are
not
taking
place
in
courts
of
record,
in
courts
where
the
defendants
ordinarily
have
counsel
of
their
own
or
appointed
counsel
that
are
taking
place
in
police
courts.
these
are
courts
where
defendants
are
brought
in
groups,
where
testimony
is
by
one
policeman
where
the
judge
is
highly
unsympathetic
to
the
views
and
arguments
of
defendants.
to
let
a
policeman
loose
on
the
streets
with
the
word
“good”
as
his
law
and
all
that
he
need
shown
in
order
to
justify
an
arrest
and
attention
of
a
citizen,
i
think
is
patently
unconstitutional.
i
think
it
violates
every
tenant
of
due
process.
to
let
a
judge
sit
in
judgment
upon
penal
offenders
with
his
only
standard
that
of
right
or
wrong,
is
under
any
definition
a
void
for
vagueness,
a
void
statute.
several
questions
are
presented
by
the
davenport
definition
of
“leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.”
for
example,
what
specific
evil
or
what
group
of
evils
that
congress
wished
to
circumscribe
within
the
words
“leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life”?
are
they
petty
acts
alone?
i
don't
know.
i
think
not.
i
think
that
major
acts
would
also
be
not
good
and
not
right.
there's'
nothing
in
the
statute
to
distinguish
between
them.
perhaps,
one
might
have
thought
immoral
or
profligate
life
refers
to
sexual
aberrations.
however,
davenport
tells
us
that
matters
immoral
are
not
confined
to
matters
sexual
in
nature.
they
concern
a
lot
of
other
things
including
things
that
aren't
right
and
aren't
good.
so,
in
other
words,
there's
no
limitation
in
the
framework
of
sexuality
and
extends
to
other
acts
as
well.
it
was
a
statute
attempted
--
was
the
attempt
of
a
statute
to
expands
acts
or
other
recognized
categories
of
crimes?
i
think
not
because
if
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
it
would
be
a
mere
redundancy.
they
are
already
on
the
books
of
the
district
of
columbia,
ample
provisions
dealing
with
theft,
with
murder,
with
rape,
with
petty
larceny,
with
things
of
that
nature.
i
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
suspect
that
subsection
3
was
meant
to
cover
only
those
acts.
does
immoral
and
profligate
life
mean
acts
committed
in
public
or
is
it
confined
to
acts
committed
in
private?
i
think
very
well,
it
might
be
applied
to
acts
committed
in
private.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
tell
us
one
way
or
another.
does
“leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life”
refer
to
interference
with
other
people,
interference
with
other
people's
property
or
simply
the
interference
with
other
people's
sensibilities?
i
suggest
that
it
covers
all
three.
i
suggest
that
the
davenport
definition
tells
us
that
it
covers
all
three.
are
words
alone
enough
to
constitute
the
offense
of
“leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life?”
i
don't
know,
but
i
think
they
might
be,
and
this
brings
us
to
perhaps
the
most
important
reason
why
leading
an
immoral
or
propagate
life
should
not
be
allowed
to
remain
on
the
statute
for
us.
this
court,
in
areas
of
free
speech
and
free
press,
the
freedoms
of
expression
has
been
very
zealous
to
strike
down
statutes,
which
possibly
might
be
used
to
impinge
upon
the
freedoms
of
expression.
i
think
if
ever
there
was
a
statute
which
might
be
used
to
impinge
upon
the
freedoms
of
expression,
it's
subsection
3.
leading
an
immoral
or
propagate
life
is
giving
a
speech
under
a
license
from
the
department
of
interior
on
fergus
square
about
the
tenants
of
nazism
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life.
when
i
make
my
private
moral
judgments,
i
think
so.
if
i
was
a
judge,
if
i
was
a
policemen
in
the
district
of
colombia,
i
might
feel
compelled
to
think
so
under
subsection
3.
one
can
think
of
other
numerous
examples
of
possible
abuses
of
the
freedoms
of
expression
by
virtue
of
subsection
3.
it
is
true
that
in
this
case,
it
has
not
been
shown
because
of
the
absence
of
a
trial
record
whether
in
fact,
mr.
hicks
was
engaging
in
constitutionally
protective
activity
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
but
this
isn't
the
important
thing
where
the
constitutional
rights
of
freedom
of
expression
are
concerned,
this
court
will
allow
a
person
to
invoke
the
constitutional
rights
in
effect
of
a
third
party
so
long
as
the
statute
under
which
he
is
convicted,
can
under
its
construction
by
the
courts
of
that
jurisdiction
the
use
to
impinge
upon
freedoms
of
expressions
and
such
a
case
was
naacpb
v.
button.
there
was
no
showing
that
to
register
as
required
by
the
virginia
act
in
the
button
case,
would
impinge
upon
any
constitutional
right
of
the
naacp
or
its
members.
the
court
however,
struck
down
that
particular
part
of
the
statute
that's
unconstitutional
because
it
could
very
well
have
been
used
to
impinge
upon
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
members
of
the
naacp.
subsection
3,
i
suggest
again,
fits
the
category
very
well.
it
could
very
well
be
used
to
impinge
upon
freedoms
of
expression.
our
personal
confidence
in
the
ability
of
the
judges
of
the
district
of
columbia,
court
of
general
sessions
to
zealously
uphold
their
oath
of
office
and
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
defendants
as
much
i
subjectively
believe
in
it,
cannot
be
a
reason
for
allowing
subsection
3
to
continue
in
existence
as
a
valid
statute.
the
very
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
freedom
is
to
take
out
of
the
hands,
the
subjective
hands
of
judges
and
policemen,
the
permission
to
exercise
those
rights.
it
may
will
be
that
never
a
subsection
3
had
been
used
to
violate
anyone's
constitutional
rights.
this
would
be
a
remarkable
i
suspect.
it's
also
no
reason
for
its
validity
because
it
can
very
well
be
used
to
impinge
upon
rights.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
they
were
intended
as
the
description
of
the
evidence
presented
at
the
trial.
then
as
now,
i
hadn't
been
at
the
trial.
i
was
relying
upon
second,
third
and
fourth
and
the
counsel
of
what
the
evidence
had
been.
i
believe
them
to
be
true.
i'm
not
sure
of
though.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
as
far
as
i
know,
they
are
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
don't
believe
it
was,
no.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no.
but
i
couldn't
very
well
have
verified
my
then
belief
that
that
is
what
the
evidence
had
shown.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
that's
what
i'm
telling,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
the
mootness
point.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
that's
right.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
don't
want
to
overstate.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
time
without
in.
i
think
it's
--
at
least
until
now,
i
think
that's
the
only
question
really.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
think
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
time
limitation
in
the
judgment
of
the
court,
one
must
read
into
the
judgment
imposition
of
sentencing
and
suspended
indefinitely.
i
think
the
burden
is
upon
those
suggesting
mootness
to
show
that
that
indefinite
period
is
now
ended.
i
don't
think
they
can.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
think
it
will
be
time
enough
if
he's
again
brought
before
the
court
and
sentence
is
imposed
upon
him
to
raise
that
particular
constitutional
point.
i
think
it's
clear
there
is
a
great
constitutional
question
presented
if
this
were
attempted.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
hasn't
been
done
in
the
fast
however.
i
don't
know.
the
records
on
the
court
of
general
sessions
are
quite
inadequate.
other
attempted
limitations
upon
the
district
of
colombia
vagrancy
statute
are
set
out
in
our
brief
and
explained
there.
they
add
up
to
one
thing
that
the
judicial
explication
of
subsection
3
hasn't
added
anything
to
what
we
can
learn
from
the
words
themselves.
there
are
several
cases
in
this
court,
none
of
them
majority
holdings
which
are
instructive
however
on
the
judicial
attitude
toward
the
words
immoral,
as
a
word
immoral
specifically.
those
are
also
discussed
in
our
brief
and
i'd
like
to
discuss
particularly
the
case
in
musser
v.
utah.
musser,
m-u-s-s-e-r
v.
utah
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes
sir.
in
that
case,
the
constitutionality
of
the
utah
conspiracy
statute
was
in
question
and
that
attempted
the
punish
for
conspiracy
among
other
things,
“any
person
who
conspired
to
do
any
act
injurious
to
public
morals.”
the
case
came
to
this
court
for
some
reason
which
isn't
clear
to
me
the
constitutionality
of
the
words
any
act
injurious
to
public
morals
haven't
been
challenged
in
the
lower
courts.
this
court
on
it's
hearing
of
the
argument,
the
first
argument
of
the
case
suggested
the
counsel
that
there
was
a
great
constitutional
question
and
called
for
reargument.
the
reargument
was
had
and
at
that
time,
it
appeared
that
the
utah
supreme
court
haven't
passed
on
the
question
so
the
majority
of
this
court
sent
the
case
back
there
in
an
opinion
which
is
highly
instructive
on
the
court's
feeling
about
the
use
of
the
word
moral
in
the
penal
statute.
not
surprisingly,
this
court
was
very
dubious
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
particular
word
in
the
penal
statute
and
it
sent
the
case
back
to
utah
with
that
dubiety.
not
surprisingly,
the
utah
supreme
court
thereafter
held
that
the
criminal
conspiracy
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague
and
indefinite,
and
struck
it
down
and
reversed
the
convictions.
i
think
that's
the
nearest
thing
i
can
point
to
as
a
holding
in
this
court,
but
i
think
the
sense
of
other
opinions
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
quite
clearly
indicate
that
the
words
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life
are
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
had
any
idea
before
last
night,
that
mootness
would
be
a
major
issue
in
this
case
and
i
think
it
is
not,
i
would
have
come
prepared
to
discuss
it.
i
would
like
to
suggest
at
this
time
that
petitioner
be
given
an
opportunity
to
file
a
memorandum
of
some
sort
in
opposition
showing
our
views
on
mootness
point,
if
that's
thought
necessary.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
on
the
mootness
point
itself,
i
should
point
out
that
whether
or
not
a
man
can
still
be
imprisoned,
it's
not
the
only
question
when
considering
mootness.
under
dc
code
section
22104,
is
just
been
pointed
out
to
me,
one
and
one
half
times
the
penalty
for
a
criminal
offense
can
be
imposed
if
a
man
has
been
convicted
of
that
offense
at
any
time
in
the
past.
so
in
another
words,
as
long
as
mr.
hicks'
vagrancy
conviction
whether
moot
at
the
moment
it
was
imposed
or
not,
as
long
as
it
stands
he
can
the
next
time,
if
there
is
a
next
time
that
he
is
brought
in
on
a
charge
of
vagrancy,
be
imprisoned
for
up
to
90
days
plus
half
of
90
and
fined
$300
plus
half
of
$300.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
don't
think
mr.
hicks
would
like
to
come
to
the
supreme
court
every
time
he's
charged
with
vagrancy.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
shortly,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
few
misapprehensions,
few
of
the
many
that
had
been
raised.
the
court
of
general
sessions
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
a
court
of
record
as
i
understand
what
that
term
means.
court
reporters
are
not
ordinarily
available
if
a
defendant
wishes,
a
transcript
made,
he
must
make
his
own
arrangements
to
have
a
court
reporter
present.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
he
must
pay
for
it.
there
is
no
provision
for
an
in
forma
pauperis
proceeding
although
the
court
will
in
occasion
appoint
counsel.
there
is
no
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes
it
was.
yes,
appointed
counsel
was
present
at
this
trial,
the
record
reflects
so.
but
to
call
--
the
court
of
general
sessions,
a
court
of
record
because
a
person
can
have
a
paid
reporters
there
and
to
prepare
a
transcript
just
to
call
any
court,
the
court
of
record.
it's
not
customarily
done.
there
aren't
many
people
charged
with
vagrancy
who
can
pay
it
for
a
court
reporter.
i
don't
know
of
a
case
where
it's
ever
been
done.
as
far
as
the
agreed
statement
an
appeal
goes,
this
is
just
the
result
of
the
memory
of
counsel
on
the
appeal.
in
my
case
and
in
the
case
of
the
district
of
columbia,
the
particular
counsel
involved
had
not
been
at
the
trial.
i
can't
speak
for
the
district,
i
am
not
sure
of
that,
i
know
i
wasn't.
i
know
that
any
statement
i
would
have
to
agree
to
and
have
to
involve,
as
i
said
hearsay
statements
from
others.
they
conflicted,
of
course
they
would,
person's
memory
on
what
goes
on
in
a
day
in
the
court
of
general
session
will
necessarily
conflict
with
another
person.
there
are
hundreds
of
cases
tried,
not
one
just
as
insignificant
as
the
other.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
for
all
i
know
what
is
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
am
not
aware
but
--
a
statute
of
the
district
of
columbia
which
makes
lodging
in
a
public
comfort
station
a
crime,
i
know
that
specification
in
the
information,
what
we
are
attacking
those
statute.
i
don't
think
that
this
particular
specification
helps
statute
at
all.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
words
immoral
or
profligate
life
which
would
suggest
that
lodging
in
a
public
comfort
station
is
immoral
or
profligate
or
perhaps
it
would.
if
it
would,
i
think
that's
just
proves,
how
vague
it
is.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no,
i
don't
believe
it
too.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
am
quite
sure
he
was
convict
under
subsection
3.
this
i
believe
as
i
understand
it
is
the
specification.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
my
understanding
of
the
facts
as
if
he
was,
i
don't
know
what
else
he
was
doing.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no
it
doesn't.
none
of
the
evidence
in
--
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
i
don't
believe
of
the
agreed
statement,
i
believe
on
the
information
on
the
printed
form
on
page
2
i
think
of
record.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
yes.
the
very
--
well,
it
might
have
been,
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no.
there
was
no
argument
as
i
recall.
again,
there
is
no
record
as
i
recall
on
the
argument
none
of
the
facts
were
gone
over.
the
judge
to
my
mine
was
quite
convinced
that
the
conviction
of
that
in
offense
had
been
committed.
i
didn't
press
the
point
at
length,
the
point
in
response
from
the
district
of
columbia,
their
argument
i
didn't
contend
the
facts
at
all.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
that's
right,
yes.
another
misapprehension
has
to
do
with
the
previous
attacks
made
on
subsection
3
in
cases
decided
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
that's
the
three-judge
local
court
of
appeals.
the
respondent
cites
the
rogers
and
davenport
cases.
it
is
true
if
you
read
those
cases,
you
will
see
references
to
constitutional
arguments.
in
the
rogers
case,
if
my
recollection
serves
me,
the
attack
was
not
upon
subsection
3
itself,
i
am
sure
that
the
attack
was
not
to
avoid
for
vagueness.
in
davenport,
you
may
read
the
opinion
and
not
know
what
the
attack
was.
i
believe
the
opinion
just
states
the
various
constitutional
grounds
have
been
urged
for
the
reversal
we
find
no
merit
in
any
of
them.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
particular
point
before
the
court
on
this
appeal.
i
am
sorry
because
of
the
mootness
point
that
the
respondent
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
present
further
argument
on
the
only
reason
why
the
case
is
before
this
court.
the
constitutionality
of
the
words
immoral
or
profligate
life,
i
suspect
that
the
argument
wasn't
favoring
by
respondent.
i
don't
think
that
the
serious
argument
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
words
can
be
made.
in
closing,
i
can
only
adopt
the
statement
of
mr.
pair.
the
meaning
of
the
words
leading
an
immoral
or
profligate
life,
as
that
meaning
was
defined
in
davenport
can't
be
added
to.
that's
precisely
my
point,
it
covers
the
whole
spectrum
of
the
human
behavior.
under
davenport,
a
man
must
lead
a
good
life,
he
must
do
what
is
right,
he
must
avoid
what
is
wrong.
if
this
is
permissible
statutory
language
for
penal
statutes,
there
is
no
void
for
vagueness
doctrine.
there
is
such
a
doctrine
of
course,
i
think
the
words
are
unconstitutional
under.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
no
we
didn't,
no.
i
believe
the
argument
and
we'll
be
made.
mr.
charles
w.
wolfram
we
have
another
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
having
to
do
with
invidious
discrimination
because
of
the
latter
to
specifications
of
what
vagrancy
is
under
subsection
3.
in
others
words,
not
having
employment
and
not
having
a
local
source
of
incom.
we
have
dropped
that
contention
on
this
appeal
not
because
i
don't
want
the
court
to
consider
it
but
because
i
think
and
i
think
it's
painfully
obvious
that
the
words
are
just
unconstitutionally
vague
and
it's
an
easy
case.
i
don't
think
that
more
difficult
questions
have
to
be
considered.
thank
you.
