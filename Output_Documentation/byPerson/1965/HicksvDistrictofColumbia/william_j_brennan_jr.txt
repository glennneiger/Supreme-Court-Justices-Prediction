justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
obliged
to?
what
obliged
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
discretion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
just
–
off
earlier
by
saying
nothing
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
view
of
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
have
a
view
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
this
--
the
district
statute
is
affirmed
on
the
ground
you
suggest,
would
the
same
apply
then
to
all
those
statutes
and
ordinances
that
you
have
listed
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
any
of
the
statute,
this
one
at
page
60
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
it
says
that
the
court
shall
have
power,
does
it
not,
to
suspend
imposition
“for
such
period
as
the
court
may
direct.”
now,
my
question
is
this.
does
that
means
for
example
if
the
sentencing
judge
said,
“i'm
going
to
suspend
the
imposition
of
sentence
for
three
years,”
could
you
do
that
on
to
that
language?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
--
is
there
anything
in
that
--
as
these
wordings
might
suggest
that
he
could
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
that's
right,
is
the
imposition
of
conditions
a
--
it
sounds
like
condition
to
the
imposition
--
of
the
suspension
of
the
imposition
of
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
there
has
been
no
sentence
here
at
all
if
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
to
say
that
this
was
a
power
in
the
trial
court
of
understanding
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
this
device
of
imposition
of
sentence
suspended
without
conditions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
conditions
and
that
that
in
effect
was
to
say,
this
is
a
case
and
that
congress
empowered
the
judge
to
do
this
were
all
that
ever
impose
the
sentence
and
none
shall
ever
be
impose
not
withstanding
the
finding
of
guilt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
why
congress
send
to
the
--
better
this
imposition
of
sentence
suspended,
i
was
in
a
couch
in
the
physiology
of
the
judge
shall
have
the
power
in
proper
cases
not
to
impose
anything.
that's
what
you're
telling
us
in
effect
to
what
was
done
here
and
that
this
is
what
the
statute
empower
these
judges
to
be.
that's
funny
language,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suspend
imposition
of
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
in
the
official
record
apparently
the
judge
uses
stamp
for
this,
doesn't
he?
isn't
it
that
he
said
that
this
--
the
trial
of
record
on
page
3
and
4
is
--
at
page
4
up
at
the
top,
i'm
looking
at
the
right
thing,
i'm
at
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
stamp
he
uses
it,
isn't
it?(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
suggest
that
this
is
a
sort
of
thing
that's
done
quite
often?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
okay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
this
vagueness
argument
it
ought
to
be
addressed
to
this
sentencing
provision.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
pair?
i
think
our
practice
ordinarily
is
when
something
is
moot
is
recognizing
this
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
on
federal
side
all
the
way
down
to
the
initial
judgment.
is
this
a
case
where
we
can
do
that
if
you're
right
on
mootness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seem
we
don't
do
it
that
way
as
--
if
i'm
correct
in
my
recollection,
i
think
the
ordinarily
where
--
where
we
find
something
as
mootness
we
move
--
we
set
aside
the
judgment
and
direct
wiping
of
the
slate
all
the
way
down
to
the
initial
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
would
have
been
about
september
of
1964?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
judgment
was
june
13,
1963,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
would
be
september
1964.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it
would
be
the
same
business
wouldn't
it
mr
pair
because
a
judge
had
power
and
not
to
sentence,
he
didn't
sentence,
it's
moot
and
therefore
a
conviction
stands
and
the
man
can
do
nothing
about
it.
it
wouldn't
make
sense,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
conviction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
--
there
would
--
would
there
be
stamp
on
that
condition's
imposed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it
would
have
appear
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
the
--
something
like
conditions
imposed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
