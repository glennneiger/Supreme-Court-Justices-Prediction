justice
potter
stewart
the
matter
to
which,
the
matter
put
an
issue
on
the
petition
approved?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
response
to
the
petition?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
wasn't
put
an
issue,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you'd
said
there
wasn't
an
opposition.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
that's
the
matter
of
the
district
of
columbia
law
but
that's
--
your
brother
in
opposition
has
exactly
the
opposite
view
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
he
does
cite
some
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
st.
pierre
against
united
states,
fishwick
against
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
in
your
brief
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
not
in
your
memorandum
on
mootness
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that
right
was
certainly
accorded
in
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
this
man
was
arrested
for
pleading
a
--
perhaps
to
get
an
immoral
life
and
--
and
also
one
other
things
that
it
is
and
it's
or,
for
lodging
in
the
public
comfort
station
and
i
supposed
that's
a
specific
and
i
suppose
it's
nothing
unconstitutional
if
a
government
wants
to
say
it's
--
an
advance
to
setup
housekeeping
in
a
public
comfort
station.
justice
potter
stewart
so
as
far
as
you
know
mr.
wolfram,
it's
surprise
you
could
tell
us
except
to
define
hearsay
what
the
evidence
was
that
--
in
this
case
was
that
this
petitioner
was
lodging
in
a
comfort
station,
that's
one
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
do
you
think
that's
vague
or
unconstitutional
of
act
in
part
of
government
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
separate
statute
or
ordinance
as
far
as
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
statement
is
made
that
in
this
appeal
no
contention
is
made
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
bring
appellant
within
the
classification.
and
the
record
contains
no
recital
of
the
factual
situation
upon
which
the
arrest
of
convictions
were
based.
appellant
asserts
only
the
claim
that
this
classification
of
vagrancy
is
unconstitutional,
that's
a
fair
statement
of
your
position
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
here,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
make
any
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
do
you
make
any
here
as
to
the
--
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
make
a
status
as
such,
a
criminal
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
you
has
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
--
