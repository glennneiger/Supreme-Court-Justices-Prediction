justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
there
be
a
sentence
imposed
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
wasn't
sentenced
at
all,
you
say
it's
void
sentence
and
if
that's
the
case,
you
have
a
man
who's
convicted
and
never
been
sentenced.
why
couldn't
he
sentenced
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
imposition
of
sentence
is
suspended
but
you
say
that
there's
no
sentence
at
all
had
been
imposed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
[inaudible]
execution
of
sentence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
ask
you
to
answer
that
you
--
if
we
consider
the
case
moot
when
the
time
of
judgment
was
entered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
bit
moot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
little
bit
moot.[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
there
is
a
misprint
on
the
page
60
on
this
fact
that
it
says
--
it
said,
the
imposition
or
execution
of
sentence
maybe
suspended
for
such
period
that
the
court
may
direct,
and
the
court
may
and
or
before
the
expiration
of
such
period
remand
such
sentence.
is
that
remand
in
the
act
or
does
it
say
may
impose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
meant
by
that,
remand
it
to
whom
and
where
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
the
correct
word?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
thing
it
bothers
me,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
hold
what
you
say
without
completely
rewriting
this
part
of
the
sentence.
it's
plainly
is
intended
or
agree
with
it
to
give
the
trial
judge
power
to
suspend
the
sentence
such
period
as
he
may
direct.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
condition
has
--
it
doesn't
leave
any
impression
there
that
he
could
suspend
it
only
for
a
period
for
which
a
sentence
could
be
imposed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
talking
about
this
act.
how
could
we
construe
that
--
that
way
without
just
putting
words
in
it
that
not
there
and
taking
some
out
with
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
a
different
thing.
so
far
as
this
one
is
concerned,
it
would
apply
--
how
can
we
do
what
you
ask
without
adding
sentence
and
take
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
--
i
am
talking
about
the
act,
not
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
just
an
uncompleted
action
on
the
part
of
the
judge,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
all
--
isn't
that
in
line
with
the
original
idea
that
court
should
involve
where
the
statute
--
while
the
law
did
not
give
them
the
right
to
grant
probation,
and
they
wanted
to
do
so.
as
i
recall,
as
i
haven't
for
for
years,
but
as
i
recall
it,
courts
evolve
this
plan
to
say,
“well,
we
would
just
want
to
impose
any
sentence
at
all.”
we
just
wait
about
imposing
sentence
and
then
if
we
want
to
later,
we'll
impose
the
sentence.
that's
seems
to
be
the
concept
upon
which
this
statute
is
vague.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
execution,
finding
the
execution.
i
am
talking
about
suspending
--
putting
any
sentence
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise,
again
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
there
be
a
great
difference
of
views
among
the
people
as
to
whether
that
--
found
that
is
immoral
or
was
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
define
immoral?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
define
immoral?
justice
hugo
l.

have
you
