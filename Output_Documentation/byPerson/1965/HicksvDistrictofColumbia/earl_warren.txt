--
j.
hicks,
petitioner
versus
district
of
columbia.
mr.
speiser.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wolfram
maybe
admitted
for
that
purpose.
mr.
wolfram,
you
may
proceed
with
the
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
any
judicial
gloss
been
put
on
that
phrase
in
the
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pair.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pair
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
an
idle
act
from
the
part
of
the
court
to
say,
judgment
is
suspended?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
it's
tantamount
to
saying
there
shall
be
no
punishment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
pair,
i
know
that
you
must
have
some
theory
on
that
--
is
if
he
has
–
if
it
is
suspended
for
any
period,
certainly
a
man
would
be
entitled
to
know
--
if
you
don't
know
how
would
he
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
he
is
suspended
for
one
year
plus
90
days?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
not
that
long,
how
much
less?
what
is
the
limitation
on
the
suspension
of
the
--
of
a
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
how
long?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
congress
intended
that
--
to
have
the
court
to
perform
an
idle
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
it
say
if
it's
--
if
sentence
is
suspended
with
conditions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
imposition
of
the
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
very
long.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
are
to
find
to
be
just
as
moot
when
the
judgment
was
ripe
–-
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
under
your
main
argument
that
it
becomes
moot
as
of
the
time
the
judgment
was
rendered,
how
could
a
man
ever
get
his
rights
vindicated
up
here?
how
could
he
ever
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
does
that
square
with
your
statement
that
it's
practically
an
idle
act
for
the
judge
to
say
that
the
judgment
is
suspended
as
he
did
in
this
case
and
that
as
--
he
has
no
power
to
do
anything
further.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
wondering
this,
suppose
the
judge
said,
“i'll
give
you
a
suspended
judgment
of
30
days.”
it's
your
contention
as
i
understand
it
that
at
the
end
of
30
days,
that
case
becomes
moot
so
far
as
ever
coming
to
this
court
is
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
didn't
put
any
conditions,
i
suspend
your
sentence
for
30
days.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
give
you
30
days
to
suspend
the
judgment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
this
--
do
you
know
of
any
direct
authority
that
says
he
can
do
what
he
did
here
and
make
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
just
an
isolated
case,
an
isolated
judgment
or
is
this
more
or
less
common
practice
in
the
district
--
does
--
do
the
judges
normally
or
often
say
just
what
this
judge
said
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
says
less
serious,
now
would
you
name
the
most
that
consider
less
serious?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
--
i
notice
you
only
have
a
very
two
minutes
more,
i
wonder
if
you
referring
to
get
to
the
constitutional
question
for
which
we
took
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
within
ten
days,
yes
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
recess
now.
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
pay
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
your
motion
to
set
aside
the
finding
of
guilty,
you
recited
the
facts
as
you
understood
on
page
6
of
the
record.
were
those
facts
contested
on
that
motion?
