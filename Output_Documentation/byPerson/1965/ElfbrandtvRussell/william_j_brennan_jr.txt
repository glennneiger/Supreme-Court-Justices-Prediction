mr.
haggerty,
i
wonder
--
is
the
reference
you're
making
to
what
appears
at
47
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it's
--
i
understood
this
was
the
first
case,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
is
this
what
you
say
adopts
the
scales
test
of
membership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
this,
may
i
ask?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
on
page
47,
which
i
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
know
but
look
(inaudible),
therefore
used
the
word
“advocacy.”
they
were
talking
there
about
advocacy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
this
mean
at
page
47?
speaking
of
subdivision
(e),
i'm
quoting
from
the
middle
paragraph
at
47.
“it
prohibits
any
membership
in
any
organization
having
for
one
of
its
purposes
the
overthrow
by
force
and
violence
the
government
of
the
state
of
arizona
or
any
of
its
political
subdivisions,
including
passive
and
nominal
membership.”
cf.
scales
v.
united
states.
it
seems
to
me,
the
supreme
court
had
ruled
a
contract
that
said
that
membership
here
is
much
broader
than
it
was
in
scales
versus
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
(inaudible)
you've
been
telling
us
your
supreme
court
has
adopted
the
scales
test
and
it
seems
to
me
what
i've
just
read
to
you
indicates
that
they
rejected
the
scales
test
for
a
broader
one
including
passive
and
nominal
membership.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
--
well,
that
maybe
so.
i
think
you
referred
it
to
be
the
first
decision.
i
don't
recall
it,
the
second.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
this
cited?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
is
the
second,
beginning
at
page
72,
i
don't
even
see
a
reference
to
membership
and
certainly
no
citation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
scales.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
say
the
--
do
you
say
the
attorney
general
took
this
position
before
the
court,
before
his
own
court
that
it
(voice
