chief
justice
earl

we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
haggerty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
a
man
belonged
to
some
organization
that
had
been
cited
by
the
un-american
affairs
committee
of
the
congress
and
he
was
--
he
had
no
knowledge
himself
as
to
this
being
a
communist
organization,
but
it
was
cited
by
that
committee
as
being
a
communist
front
organization
or
some
other
communist
organization
and
he
was
working
for
the
state
and
he
was
afraid
he
might
go
to
jail
for
perjury
if
he
signed
the
thing.
how
would
he
know
whether
he
could
safely
sign
that
affidavit
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
it's
never
been
definitely
proved
in
any
court
that
this
organization
is
cited
by
the
un-american
affairs
committee
is
a
communist
organization,
is
communist-controlled,
or
anything
else.
it
just
says
that
it
is.
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
was
so
when
it
had
been
put
on
the
list
by
the
attorney
general
and
he
claims
that
it
isn't
and
he
want
--
as
far
as
he
knows,
and
he
wants
to
know
whether
he
can
continue
his
employment
without
taking
that
oath
because
there's
no
one
to
tell
him
whether
that
--
whether
he'd
be
in
danger
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
attorney
general
of
the
country
has
put
it
on
the
list
as
a
communist-controlled
organization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
are
you
confident
that
your
reports
would
hold
to
that
view?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
do
with
the
statement
that
mr.
morgan
just
read
from
your
chief
justice
out
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
of
any
act
making
conduct
perjurious
which
is
done
in
the
future
even
though
there
was
no
intent
to
do
it
at
the
time
the
oath
was
taken?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
i
make
--
i
make
one
of
these
affidavits.
i
have
no
communist
associations
of
any
kind
and
two
or
three
years
later,
i
do
join
some
organization.
is
there
any
comparable
law
that
makes
that
conduct
of
that
kind
perjurious,
so
far
as
the
original
affidavit
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
this
do
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
would
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
would
do
that,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
do
you
think
that's
alright?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
to
say
that
anyone
who
does
anything
in
the
future
which
is
inconsistent
with
an
oath
that
he
has
taken
in
the
past
is
perjury
or
will
be
punished
as
perjury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that's
alright?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
only
reason
i
asked
that
is
this,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
a
crime
for
anyone
to
do
the
things
that
are
proscribed
by
this
act,
whether
he's
a
public
servant
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
right?
well,
then
why,
unless
they
intend
to
make
it
in
the
nature
of
perjury,
do
they
--
they
put
--
add
this
condition
to
the
oath
of
a
public
servant?
why
wouldn't
he
just
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
he
just
be
bound
by
the
other
laws
of
the
state
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
name
those
crimes
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
first
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
is
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
for
any
person
to
belong
to
any
of
the
organizations
that
are
proscribed
by
this
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
act
say,
“if
they
know”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
knowingly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
to
have
knowledge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
wondering
what
the
--
but
real
purpose
of
this
is,
if
all
of
these
things
equally
applied
to
other
people,
why
do
you
--
why
do
they
have
this
subdivision
(e)
which
makes
it
perjury
for
a
person
to
do
something
years
after
he
takes
the
oath
or
perhaps
he
had
no
intention
of
doing
that
before
--
at
the
time
he
took
the
oath,
why
wouldn't
they
prosecute
a
public
officer
or
a
public
employee
for
doing
these
things
exactly
in
the
manner
that
it
prosecutes
other
people?
why
do
they
have
to
attach
this
also
to
the
oath,
which
is
the
oath
that's
commonly
taken
in
all
states
of
the
union?
what
purpose
does
it
serve
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
morgan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
adjourn
now.
