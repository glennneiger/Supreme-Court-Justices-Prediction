justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
suggested
that's
the
very
vice
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather,
after
you
sign
this
oath,
you
sign
it
and
after
you
--
you
not
only
promise
what
is
stated
in
the
oath
and
you
not
only
disclaim
what
is
stated
in
the
oath,
but
you
disclaim
also
that
you're
not
a
member,
for
example,
of
any
of
these
organizations
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
refer
to
the
future,
except
in
terms
of
a
promise.
but
if
you
--
if
you
happen
to
be
a
member
of
one
of
these
organizations
at
the
time
you
signed
the
oath,
you're
subject
to
perjury
and
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
just
what
if
you
didn't
know
what
this
was
all
--
what
these
organizations
really
were
and
you
refused
to
sign
the
oath
because
you
didn't
know
and
the
statute
didn't
give
you
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
somebody
must
know
or
you
wouldn't
lose
your
job
over
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
also
had
at
least
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
employee
might
be
put
to
a
little
clearer
choice
though
by
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
signs
the
oath?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he
doesn't
sign
the
oath,
he
can
certainly
be
fired.
even
if
the
reason
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
reason
he
didn't
sign
it
is
that
he
didn't
understand
what
his
choices
were,
namely
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
draw
the
difference,
if
you
want
to
between
those
two
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
could
there
be
pleadings
about
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
in
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
didn't
say
that
in
this
case,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
the
law
of
arizona
is
that
membership
as
used
in
the
laws
involved
in
this
case,
membership
means
what
it
means
or
what
it
--
what
the
smith
act,
the
meaning
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
what's
the
citation
of
the
supreme
court
has
actually
said
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
is
that
all
it
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
can't
cite
--
there
is
any
court
holding
to
that
effect,
do
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
which
--
do
you
think
we
should
accept
that
as
a
clause
on
the
statute?
i
mean,
is
it
--
as
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
we
should
accept
what
the
supreme
court
said
about
other
phrases
of
this
case,
about
what
“aid”
means
or
“advocacy”
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway
we
are
bound
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
bound
by
your
court's
interpretation
of
that
--
the
meaning
of
that
--
of
those
words,
i
suppose,
and
you
think
we're
also
--
should
accept
that
--
the
membership.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
law
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly
what
they
say
about
advocacy
doesn't
mean
a
whole
lot
about
membership.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
adaptations?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
adaptations?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
no
other
constructions
that
(inaudible)?
