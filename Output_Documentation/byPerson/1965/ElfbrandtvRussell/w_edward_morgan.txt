mr.
w.
edward
morgan
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
justices
of
the
court.
in
1961,
the
25th
legislature
of
the
state
of
arizona
passed
arizona
revised
statute
38-231,
demanding
that
every
employee
of
every
board,
commission,
agency,
and
independent
office
of
the
state
in
any
of
its
cities,
towns,
school
districts,
public
institutions,
from
that
point
on,
not
pay
any
more
salary
to
any
employee
who
failed
or
refused
to
sign
a
disclaimer
oath,
the
general
hortatory
words
known
very
well
to
every
political
office
holder,
but,
adding
thereto,
a
particular
and
peculiar
meaning
by
subsection
(e)
of
that
particular
statute.
any
officer
or
employee
as
defined
in
this
section
having
taken
the
form
of
oath
or
affirmation
proscribed
by
this
section
and
knowingly
or
willfully

the
time
of
subscribing
the

or
affirmation
or
at
any
time
thereafter
during
his
term
of
office
or
employment
does
commit
or
aid
in
a
commission
of
any
act
to
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
the
government
of
this
state
or
of
any
of
its
political
subdivisions
or
advocates.
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
the
government
of
this
state
or
any
of
its
political
subdivisions
or
during
such
term
of
office
or
employment
knowingly
and
willfully
becomes
or
remains
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
or
its
successors
or
any
of
its
board
and
organizations
or
any
other
organization
having
for
one
of
its
purposes
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
the
government
of
the
state
of
arizona
or
any
of
its
political
subdivisions.
and
said
officer
or
employee
as
defined
by
this
section
prior
to
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
such
organization
or
organizations,
the
knowledge
of
said
unlawful
purpose
of
said
organization
or
organizations
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony
and
upon
conviction
thereof
shall
be
subject
to
all
the
penalties
for
perjury.
in
addition
upon
conviction
under
this
section,
the
officer
or
employee
shall
be
deemed
discharged
from
said
office
or
employment
and
shall
not
be
entitled
to
any
additional
compensation
or
any
other
emoluments
or
benefits
which
may
have
been
incident
or
pertinent
to
said
officer
appointment.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it's
a
traditional
oath
of
our
society
as
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
i
think
helen
silving
in
the
article
in
yale,
on
a
history
of
olds
traces
this
history.
it's
a
--
even
antedates
our
country
in
terms
of
its
force.
it's
a
auditorial
containing
no
penalty.
may
not
even
be
essential
to
employment
even
if
a
legislature
provides
that
it
is
such.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it
is.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
one
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it's
the
only
oath.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
when
the
legislature
added
to
it
a
specific
meaning,
which
is
section
(e).
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
exactly
so.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
exactly.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
exactly.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
at
the
same
time,
the
state
legislature
also
passed
a
anti-subversive
--
a
subversive
law
which
is
practically
per
verbiage
of
section
(e)
of
the
provisions
which
i've
read
to
you.
at
that
time,
based
with
this
legislation,
the
named
petitioner
herein,
barbara
elfbrandt,
a
teacher
and
a
quaker,
joined
together
with
two
other
teachers
and
refused
to
sign
the
oath
and
brought
an
action
in
the
superior
court
of
pima
county,
arizona,
attacking
the
law
in
a
--
on
substantially
all
of
the
grounds,
constitutional
grounds
which
had
been
advanced
in
our
two
applications
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
the
statement
of
facts
was
agreed
to
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
arizona
and
made
part
of
the
lower
court's
decision,
the
trial
court's
decision,
denoting
it
a
class
action
not
only
for
teachers
but
for
every
employee
of
both
the
state
and
the
county.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
(inaudible).
mrs.
elfbrandt
and
two
other
teachers
did
not,
within
the
90-day
period
filed
their
renewed
oath
containing
section
(e),
which
was
made
mandatory
to
be
printed
as
part
of
the
same
sheet
on
which
the
oath
was
contained
and
her
pay
was
stopped
forthwith
and
she
and
her
husband
have
--
since
that
time
to
the
present,
continued
to
be
school
teachers
without
remuneration
in
the
state
of
arizona.
one
other
man,
mr.
delgoff,
after
the
first
arizona
state
supreme
court
decision,
did
signed
the
oath
and
received
back
wages
for
a
period
of
12
months
or
13
months,
whatever
time
it
was.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
she
is
a
quaker.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
exactly.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
and,
had
previously
signed
an
oath,
an
affirmation,
oath
in
terms
of
the
paycheck
because
the
vouchers
contained
--
printed
on
them
an
affirmation
clause.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no,
not
--
and
particularly
because
it's
a
class
action
in
terms
of
what
would
then
be
available
to
all
the
employees
of
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
exactly
so,
yes.
on
the
other
hand,
one
might
suggest
that
in
as
much
as
it
is
a
class
action
and
as
much
as
we
have
argued
this
matter
to
our
state
supreme
court,
it
has
been
a
matter
of
judicial
review
on
both
occasions.
there
has
been
a
discussion
of
the
first
amendment
freedom
of
religion
as
applied
to
all
the
employees
of
the
state
of
arizona
and
their
right
to
refuse
to
take
an
oath
or
affirmation
on
the
matter.
this
has
been
argued
in
our
court.
so,
though
it's
not
particular
to
this
particular
appellant
here,
as
much
as
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
every
type
and
style
of
employee,
not
just
limited
to
school
teachers
and
to
--
and
stipulated
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
a
matter
of
condition
of
the
appeal
itself.
and
as
a
result,
the
cause
of
not
receiving
any
salary,
we
approach
this
court
in
forma
pauperis.
the
first
issue
that
must
be
met
is
whether
or
not
under
the
theories
of
this
court
in
the
balancing
of
interests
which
was
somewhat
discussed
in
the
previous
case
in
oral
argument
here
this
morning,
a
position
which
we
do
not
share
in
the
court's
view
of
the
balancing
of
the
right
of
the
state
purportedly
to
maintain
itself
as
against
the
operation
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
bill
of
rights.
however,
even
within
the
theory
of
--
philosophical
theory
of
doctrine
of
relativism
of
rights
adopted
by
this
court
over
a
series
of
cases,
like
dennis
and
etcetera,
it's
our
position
that
the
state
of
arizona,
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
this
statute
had
no
good
substance
to
even
pass
a
statute.
that
the
statute
--
one,
that
there
was
no
good
reason
for
it,
that
there
was
no
operation
of
communist
in
any
broad
scale
within
the
state
of
arizona,
no
evidence
of
that.
there'd
been
no
public
hearings.
there
were
some
adoptions
of
some
other
hearings
by
the
federal
government,
but
none
of
those
hearings
or
reports
indicate
that
there
was
any
widespread
subversion
of
public
employees
of
the
state
of
arizona.
and
understand
the
statute
does
not
only
apply
to
employees
of
the
state,
but
applies
in
counties,
cities,
of
any
affiliate
administrative
body
associated
with
the
state,
such
as
volunteer,
administrative
committees
of
cities
where
there's
no
pay
involved.
there
were
no
hearings
on
this
matter
or
public
lines.
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
subversion.
there
was
no
predicate
for
an
insult
to
the
public
employees
of
the
state
of
arizona
that
they
were
subversive
in
a
fretful
period
of
extreme
reaction
that
the
state
legislature
wanted
this
--
was
passed.
and,
as
usual,
when
things
are
pretty
feisty
and
people
are
in
the
air,
i
think
with
one
objection.
the
second
aspect
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
i
think
when
--
yes,
i
think
it
is,
under
--
even
under
your
decisions,
on
the
basis
that
when
the
court
sets
back
and
allows
the
state
to
operate
in
a
way
to
place
a
limitation
on
freedom
of
assembly
and
freedom
of
speech,
then
the
burden
is
upon
that
state
to
show
its
--
the
need
to
do
this.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
and
where
is
the
need
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
in
that
light
i
would
agree
and
concur
with
you
in
your
interpretation
of
the
matter.
in
light
of
when
--
let
us
--
to
say
that
we
establish
and
concede
that
each
individual
within
the
state
is
a
member
by
reason
of
his
national
citizenship
has
a
right
to
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
assembly.
i
think
this
statute
on
its
face
by
proscribing
association
in
particular
organizations
was
purportedly
--
are
engaged
in
antisocial
behavior
puts
obviously
on
the
face
of
it,
a
restriction
on
assembly
which
is
a
restriction
of
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
whether
it's
a
junk
case.
that
being
so,
then
we
must
measure
or
not
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
overall
need
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
arizona
to
enter
into
this
relatively
tender
area
of
limitation
of
activity.
and
in
that
case
--
in
this
case,
there's
no
showing
of
the
state
of
arizona
that
there
was
any
such
need.
secondly,
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
has
been
careful
in
the
past
is
to
see
that
--
assuming
that
a
state
does
have
a
need
and
wishes
to
fulfill
that
need,
whether
or
not
they
have
used
a
tool,
chosen
the
proper
tool
to
ex
--
to
fulfill
their
need.
the
question
is
whether
assuming
that
they
thought
that
they
had
a
problem
dealing
with
subversion,
whether
or
not
the
tool
that
they've
chosen
is
the
one
least
disruptive
of
the
rights
of
freedom
of
association
and
freedom
of
speech.
and
in
that
regard,
the
history
of
--
an
examination
of
the
authorities
in
dealing
with
the
adoption
of
loyalty
oaths,
say
in
california,
as
set
forth
in
the
citations
and
authorities
of
review
that
we've
given
in
our
brief
on
both
occasions
that
we've
been
to
this
court
would
indicate
that
the
adoption
of
the
technique
of
disclaimer
by
so-called
loyalty
oath
with
provision
similar
to
section
(e)
have
been
a
failure.
in
the
state
of
arizona,
there
hasn't
been
one
prosecution.
there
hasn't
--
one
person
turned
up
as
a
subversive.
the
evil
of
it
must
be
also
considered
in
terms
of
its
adverse
effect
upon
the
society.
and
certainly,
i
think
we've
cited
within
our
brief
the
situation,
a
study
done
under
the
auspices
of
the
twentieth
century
fund
on
the
effect
of
these
disclaimer
oaths,
on
these
loyalty
oaths,
such
as
section
(e)
of
arizona
law
and
the
academic
community,
in
which
they
were
rather
disastrous
in
terms
of
their
attitude
and
feeling
of
freedom
and
their
ability
to
speak
out
and
undertake
lines
of
development.
so,
the
evidence
that's
before
this
court
in
terms
of
this
type
of
legislation
is
one
that
in
the
state
of
arizona
show
no
fundamental
need
for
it.
and,
secondly,
it's
adopted
a
piece
of
legislation
which
has
demonstrated
in
its
effect
over
the
country,
danger
and
an
injury
to
the
academic
community.
but
assuming
for
a
minute
that
the
legislation
on
those
basis
is
perfectly
constitutional,
i
think
there
are
certain
other
aspects
that
one
might
consider
with
this
legislation
to
--
that
indicates
it's
uncons
--
that's
not
constitutional.
what
it
--
assuming
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
a
problem
with
subversion
and
a
finding
out
in
attempting
to
get
rid
of
employees
of
the
cities,
counties,
dogcatchers,
garbage
collectors,
etcetera
for
being
subversive,
may
that
society
--
may
that
legislature
throw
the
burden
of
dealing
with
a
problem
from
its
own
shoulders
onto
the
individual.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
state
of
arizona
has
attempted
to
do
in
two
fundamental
ways,
one,
by
denying
of
hearing
and
the
question
of
procedural
due
process.
the
second
aspect
is
by
framing
a
piece
of
legislation
that
is
so
vague
that
the
man
of
ordinary
understanding
cannot
be
properly
advised
of
what
conduct
will
allow
him
to
act
in
safety.
what
the
state
of
arizona
does
by
presenting
section
(e)
to
any
employee
is
to
shift
the
burden,
instead
of
going
through
an
administrative
proceedings,
with
hearings,
with
accusations,
with
accusers,
with
transcripts,
the
individual
must
meet
the
issue
all
by
himself.
now,
the
question
comes,
and
i
don't
think
we
need
too
much
discussion
on
the
fact
that
though
an
employee
doesn't
have
a
right
to
a
government
job,
that
the
government
in
dealing
with
the
employee
must
afford
him
basic
due
process
in
terms
of
--
with
firing
and
hiring
procedures.
i
think
we've
set
that
forth
in
a
number
of
different
cases
before
this
court
in
our
brief.
but
taking
the
situation
of
a
right
of
hearing,
what
is
the
individual
faced
with?
in
this
case,
if
he
wants
to
continue
to
work
for
income,
he
wants
to
continue
to
receive
his
salary,
he
must
sign
the
oath.
if
he
doesn't,
he
doesn't
get
a
salary.
on
the
other
case,
if
he
wants
employment,
he
must
sign
the
oath
or
he
may
not
be
employed.
this
is
a
--
fundamentally
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
quality
of
placing
a
burden
upon
the
individual
to
decide
all
of
the
terms
of
this
legislation,
when
we
come
to
the
vagueness
question
itself,
but
notice
the
burden
that
it
puts
upon
the
individual.
one,
at
his
penalty,
he
must
determine
all
of
the
terms
of
this
particular
subsection.
he
must
determine
what
knowing
is
and
what
advocacy
is,
and
aid
is,
and
what
an
association
that
has
as
one
of
its
purposes
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
all
of
this
burden
is
put
on
the
individual.
he
stands
there
by
himself,
in
secret,
without
any
aid,
without
any
really
effective
aid
of
counsel,
unless
he
hires
himself,
all
the
burden
of
judging
his
own
conduct
and
of
interpreting
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
thrown
upon
his
shoulders,
what
to
find
out.
so
the
state
of
arizona
might
find
out
if
he
is
a
subversive,
might.
is
there
enough
validity
to
the
--of
placing
the
individual
with
this
type
of
burden
to
gain
benefit
to
the
state
of
arizona
in
terms
of
attempting
to
find
out
or
discriminate
or
get
rid
of
a
subversive,
highly
doubtful
on
the
basis
of
the
history
of
this
particular
legislation.
the
--
this
court,
in
the
second
nostrand
versus
little
case,
noted
that
the
--
in
the
second
state
decision,
after
the
remand
by
this
court,
noted
that
their
oath
was
prospective
only
and
it
held
that
where
tenure
was
involved
on
the
university
professors
of
that
state,
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing.
the
court
there,
i
think,
erroneously
determined
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
that
there
was
no
right
to
public
employment
and
therefore
no
right
of
hearing
on
any
other
employee
other
than
those
that
have
been
specifically
granted
tenure
by
their
reason
of
being
a
university
professor.
but
the
--
but
this
court
in
nostrand
versus
little,
and
the
state
court
recognized
in
nostrand
versus
little
the
essential
necessity
of
a
hearing
to
grant
a
person
the
right
to
explain
why
or
why
not
they're
not
accepting
or
taking
the
oath.
the
distinction
between
a
criminal
prosecution
and
the
placing
of
the
burden
directly
upon
the
individual
by
confronting
him
with
his
decision
is
that
in
terms
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
one,
all
of
the
procedure
of
the
state
would
be
that
a
trained
county
attorney,
or
district
attorney,
prosecuting
officer
would
have
to
evaluate
with
his
legal
training
and
experience
and
knowledge
the
exact
meaning
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
an
individual
case.
they
have
to
have
a
proper
and
preliminary
investigation
of
the
purported
facts
of
the
individual.
there'd
have
to
be
a
conclusion
by
the
prosecution
with
understanding
of
the
probabilities
of
success.
there
would
have
to
be
a
preliminary
judicial
scrutiny
of
the
case
in
terms
of
an
issuance
of
a
warrant
for
arrest.
there
would
then
be
in
nearly
every
state
procedure
and
certainly
in
the
state
of
arizona
a
preliminary
hearing
or
a
grand
jury
scrutiny.
all
of
this
scrutiny
before
society
would
effectively
act
upon
the
individual.
by
presenting
him
with
an
oath
and
forcing
him
to
sign
it
at
the
danger
of
losing
his
job
or
danger
of
losing
his
salary,
the
state
short
circuits
all
of
the
social
security
of
the
individual
that
we
have
worked
out
in
criminal
prosecution
and
place
the
whole
burden
on
him.
the
issue
of
giving
a
man
an
opportunity
to
explain
his
position
is
fundamental
in
our
society.
it's
a
fundamental
aspect
of
due
process
itself.
the
opportunity
to
say
where
you
stand
and
why
you
stand
before
one
loses
valuable
rights
is
the
basic
concept
of
due
process,
as
established
by
this
court,
certainly
in
lerner
versus
casey
and
a
number
of
other
cases.

in
the
--
we
cite
the
case
of
heckler
versus
shepherd,
which
is
the
state
of
ari
--
in
idaho,
three-man
federal
court
deciding
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
same
provisions
as
in
the
state
of
arizona.
the
heckler
case
has
not
been
appealed.
it's
more
than
a
year.
it
was
a
divisible
statute.
it
provided
a
prohibition,
a
future
prohibition
against
advocacy
of
the
--
a
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government
and
in
substance
is
the
same.
the
court
in
heckler
versus
--
in
the
heckler
versus
shepherd,
there
set
forth
that
it
was
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
in
connection
with
vagueness
that
gave
rise
to
the
unconstitutionality
or
lack
of
constitutionality
of
such
a
proscriptive
oath.
and
the
--
both
oaths
are
the
same.
the
lower
court
felt
that
on
the
same
basis,
that
a
man
must
have
the
right
to
publicly
say
why
he
is
not
signing
such
an
oath
and
the
reasons
why
he
is
not
signing
it
so
that
the
public
may
know,
so
that
he
may
not
go
about
branded
in
our
society
without
a
forum,
without
a
record
of
his
opinions.
and
i
think
that
in
substance,
that
when
one
considers
the
grave
consequences
to
an
individual
as
to
whether
or
not
he
signed
this
oath
containing
subsection
(e)
and
his
inability
to
create
a
public
forum
for
his
position,
except
by
appeal
to
this
court,
as
suggested
in
the
reply
brief
or
answering
brief
of
the
state
is
to
place
an
undue
burden
upon
him.
there
are
certain
questions,
questions
of
whether
or
not
--
if
in
subsequent
prosecution
under
the
anti-subversive
law,
whether
or
not
the
failure
of
the
individual
who
signed
this
oath
may
not
be
used
against
him
in
a
future
criminal
prosecution
or
at
least
in
cross-examination
to
show
that,
at
that
time
he
had
a
bad
knowledge
of
his
association.
there's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
in
fact,
this
is
not
in
effect
self-incrimination
because
his
very
failure
to
take
the
oath
labels
him
in
the
community
as
either
of
two
things,
one,
a
dangerous
person
by
subversive
association
or,
two,
that
maybe
just
as
dangerous
in
our
society
as
an
unstable
person,
as
a
person
who
may
be
reckless
in
their
affiliations
or
reckless
in
their
thoughts.
in
either
one,
the
black
morale
of
our
(inaudible)
--
of
esteem
that
was
upon
the
individual,
he
carries
it
wherever
he
goes
into
every
other
form
of
employment,
particularly
this
school
teacher.
and
he
leaves
the
school
district
because
he
hasn't
signed
the
oath
and
attempts
to
get
a
job
any
other
place.
the
first
thing
that
he's
going
to
be
faced
with
is
the
fact
that
he
didn't
sign
the
oath
and
he
lost
his
public
employment.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
and
further
stay
the
law.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
i
think
that's
inaccurate.
i
think
that
it
goes
back
to
a
position
--
well
one,
i
don't
think
it
faces
the
facts,
the
reality
of
it,
particularly
in
the
school
teaching
industry.
about
80%
of
employment
is
public
employment.
it
would
be
like
the
same
old
story
before
the
norris-la
guardia
act,
if
you
don't
like
working
for
me
at
my
10
cent-an-hour
wages,
you
go
to
work
for
anyone
else
that
you
want.
to
say
to
an
individual,
if
you
don't
like
public
employment
and
the
conditions
of
it,
you
can
go
and
just
work
some
other
place,
is
not
really
a
full
answer
of
the
question.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
but,
let's
as
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
fine.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
but
let's
assume
that
with
that
condition
there's
due
process.
let's
assume
that
a
hearing
is
afforded
where
the
person
can
test
out
whether
or
not,
one,
their
understanding
of
the
law
is
correct.
one,
it
assumes
that
when
a
person
doesn't
sign
the
oath
that
they
have
a
competent
understanding
of
the
oath.
that's
where
we'll
come
to
the
vagueness
issue
in
a
second.
but
let's
take
it
on
a
--
how
having
a
hearing
would
avoid
some
of
the
vagueness
problems
of
this
particular
legislation
because,
there
the
individual
could
work
out
what
the
law
actually
meant,
vis-à-vis
his
conduct.
does
aid
mean
aid?
does
advocacy
mean
advocacy?
and,
it
would
be
explained
to
him.
in
this
position,
the
individual
has
no
explanation
of
what
this
oath
means,
nor
can
they
be
in
a
position
without
jeopardy
of
saying,
“well,
if
i
belong
to
the
international
association
of
astronomical
scientists,
though
its
communist
dominated,”
and
we
will
presume
that
every
communist
organization
has
one
of
its
purposes
the
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government,
“does
this
bring
me
into
jeopardy
of
the
law?
if
doesn't
bring
me
under
jeopardy
of
the
law,
then
i'm
willing
to
sign
the
oath
and
continue
my
employment.”
but,
there
is
no
forum
for
that.
there
is
no
way
that
the
person
can
reach
a
decision,
a
fact
decision,
on
his
loyalty
under
the
present
law
of
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
this
court,
i
think,
has
dealt
in
baggett
versus
bullitt,
which
we've
cited
in
our
briefs
with
unknowing
guilty
--
with
knowing
guiltless
behavior
in
the
baggett
decision
and
in
which
you've
dealt
with
this
very,
very
problem,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
knowing.
we
have
many
definitions
of
the
word
“knowing”.
this
is
not
just
as
clear
a
word
as
one
would
have
it
sometimes
meant.
the
--
in
the
--
in
united
states
versus
bianco,
cited
in
our
brief,
the
term
“knowingly”
contains
no
element
of
evil
purpose
but
purports
--
imports
a
perception
of
facts
requisite
to
make
up
a
crime.
in
u.s.
versus
martinez,
cited
in
our
brief,
where
there's
a
clue
on
it
that
the
defendant
knew
what
he
was
about
to
do
and
with
such
knowledge
proceed
to
do
the
act.
it
means
that
in
rubenstein,
u.s.
versus
rubenstein,
“knowingly
false”
means
that
the
party
honestly
did
not
believe
it
to
be
true.
you
have
even
in
your
iberville
land
co.
versus
amerada
petroleum,
knowledge
of
notice
sufficient
to
excite
action
and
put
a
person
on
his
god
and
call
for
inquiry
could
be
sufficient
knowledge.
so,
it's
not
the
simple
nice
knowledge
in
toto.
it's
a
knowledge
that
may
be
imputed
by
his
conduct
and
to
--
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
a
jury
to
decide
what
his
basic
knowledge
was
and
his
basic
intent.
it's
not
sufficient
to
give
the
individual
security
from
how
his
conduct
will
be
in
the
future
interpreted.
and
this
is
the
problem
of
the
knowing.
secondly,
when
we
get
into
the
area
of
vagueness
of
the
arizona
statute,
it's
very
interesting
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
to
redefine
--
in
its
first
decision
had
to
redefine
the
meaning
of
advocacy.
then
we
go
back,
after
the
baggett
versus
bullitt,
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
to
redefine
the
word
“aid”
in
light
of
baggett
versus
bullitt.
on
its
question
of
vagueness,
judge
bernstein,
in
the
second
opinion,
he
was
told
that
there
were
open
questions
of
vagueness,
the
question
of
what
the
statute
means
as
to
membership
in
an
organization
which
has
as
one
of
its
purposes
the
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government
and
how
much
knowledge
is
necessary.
there's
no
definition
within
the
statute
or
in
the
determinations
of
it
of
how
much
knowledge
an
individual
has
to
have
of
the
unlawful
purposes.
and,
in
your
baggett
versus
bullitt,
and
cramp
versus
florida,
the
standard
which
you
placed
in
connection
with
statutes
of
this
type
is
that
the
terms
of
the
statute
must
be
susceptible
of
objective
measurement,
and
there
is
no
objective
measurements
of
the
term
“had
knowledge
of”,
how
much
knowledge?
we
don't
know.
the
individual
is
put
on
a
burden
of
defining
a
lot
of
terms
which
apparently
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
has
had
difficulty
with
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
if
the
statute
was
so
clear,
it
seems
rather
strange
that
our
supreme
court
had
to
redefine
its
terms
twice
and
yet,
this
is
the
burden
that's
put
upon
the
individual
and
still
hasn't
decided
what
some
of
the
terms
mean.
and,
secondly,
and
i
think
as
pointed
out
by
justice
black
in
his
dissent
in
the
scales
case,
one
of
the
dangerous
things
of
such
legislation
is
this,
is
the
great
amount
of
judicial
operation
on
the
statute
of
adding
new
meanings
so
that
in
the
state
of
arizona
now
aid
those
no
longer
mean
aid
and
advocacy
does
no
longer
mean
advocacy.
it
means
something
different
from
what
it
said
originally
in
the
statute.
the
danger
of
rewriting
this
legislation
by
judicial
interpretation
to
--
in
an
attempt
to
make
--
come
up
to
constitutional
standards
is
that,
one,
the
individual
has
no
right
to
rely
on
it.
if
the
court
changes
its
mind
five
years
from
now
or
two
years
from
now,
the
defendant
has
no
constitutional
right
that's
involved.
ex
post
facto
provisions
of
the
constitution
don't
apply.
stare
decisis
is
not
a
binding
upon
the
courts.
all
these
interpretations
may
be
allowed
to
be
changed
and
the
defendant
would
have
no
relief
on
a
charge
of
perjury
in
the
state
of
arizona.
the
state
of
arizona
is
as
confused
as
it
apparently
is
in
terms
of
the
meaning
of
its
own
statute,
notwithstanding
that
the
--
that
this
court
had
already
determined
some
of
the
terms
of
advocacy.
it
seems
to
be
an
undue
burden
to
put
upon
the
laymen.
and
if
you
wish
to
understand
the
attitude
of
the
state
supreme
court
and
what
the
individual
is
against
in
the
state
of
arizona
in
terms
of
its
own
court
and
its
interpretation,
i
wish
to
read
to
you
part
of
the
first
decision
of
our
court
written
by
the
same
chief
justice
who
is
now
presently
chief
justice.
he
said
in
the
first
decision
on
this
case.
the
breadth
and
intolerance
that
--
intolerance
of
the
arizona
su
--
well,
let
me
state
it.
the
state's
interest
demands
that
public
employees
refrain
from
associations
out
of
which
even
unconscious
corruption
may
comfort
those
who
seek
world
domination.”
it
goes
on
to
second.
“the
risk
that
the
insidious
poison
may
be
spread
is
not
one
the
people
of
the
state
are
willing
to
accept.”
when
one's
own
supreme
court
talks
about
associations
out
of
which
even
unconscious
corruption
may
arise
and
then,
we
are
asked
to
sign
an
oath
with
provisions
as
vague
as
past
membership
in
terms
of
subsidiary
organizations,
in
terms
of
organizations
that
have
as
one
of
their
purposes
the
forcible
overthrow,
this
statute,
i
think,
fails
on
vagueness.
one
other
aspect
of
the
case,
i
think,
very
much
linked
to
the
same
problem
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
type
of
legislation
is
in
effect
a
bill
of
attainder.
i
know
that
the
history
of
bills
of
attainder
concept
with
this
court,
as
with
the
doctrine
of
mens
rea
have
not
receive
a
great
deal
of
consideration
in
recent
times
but
there
at
appears
to
be
at
least
a
growing
interest
on
the
part
of
this
court
with
the
attendant
concepts
of
self-incrimination
and
bills
of
attainder.
it
seems
rather
obvious
in
this
matter
that
when
an
individual
is
put
to
the
position
without
a
hearing
of
having
to
sign
an
oath
or
not
sign
this
type
of
affirmation,
that
if
for
any
reason,
he
feels
duty
bound
not
to
sign
it,
on
the
basis
he's
guilty,
because
that
would
make
an
assumption,
wouldn't
it?
we
--
we'd
be
doing
the
same
thing
which
happens
when
people
take
the
fifth
amendment.
we'd
be
making
the
assumption
that
they
were
guilty
and
that
assumption
we
may
not
legally
take,
but
it's
the
assumption
that's
taken
in
our
society
because
our
very
reaction
bespeaks
of
the
reaction
in
our
society.
the
minute
he
doesn't
take
it,
he's
proscribed,
he's
immediately
denoted
in
our
society,
and
this
is
by
legislative
quiet.
there's
no
adjudicatory
process
and
one
of
the
failures
of
the
bill
of
attainder
--
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
bills
of
attainder
is
the
prohibition
against
this
lack
of
adjudicatory
process.
in
essence,
it's
very
similar
to
the
concept
of
procedural
due
process
or
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process.
the
bills
of
attainder
might
be
forward
on
that
concept
and
the
same
sort
of
concept
is
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
because
of
the
historical
relationship
of
denying
an
adjudicatory
process
to
it.
and,
in
this
sense,
mrs.
elfbrandt
and
all
the
other
employees
of
the
state
of
arizona
put
into
an
ambivalent
position
where
either
you
sign
or
you
don't
sign,
and
if
you
don't
sign,
you
are
considered
by
our
society
to
be
guilty.
on
this
basis
--
on
the
basis
of
the
previous
decisions
in
this
state,
in
this
court,
construction
of
the
constitution,
we
therefore
feel
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
being
unconstitutionally
vague
and
for
denial
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
to
one
as
--
speculations
why
the
statute
was
created,
one
may
speculate
also
that
it
was
a
time
of
high
tension
and
feelings
within
our
state
with
some
attempt
to
discipline
its
public
employees
possibly
without
any
real
understanding
of
the
problem
itself.
in
connection
with
the
university
of
arizona
and
tenure
of
university
professors,
i
think
the
justice
answered
--
maybe
who
asked
that
question.
the
university
of
arizona
has
been
centered
for
lack
of
procedural
due
process
to
its
university
professors
by
the
aaup.
i
forget
which
justice
asked
that
question.
in
the
--
i
noticed
that
in
the
state
of
arizona,
in
terms
of
any
commitments
made
by
the
attorney
general
here
today,
several
things.
one,
its
elective
office
of
four
years
term,
our
office
of
the
supreme
court
is
for
six
years,
changing
every
two
years
on
a
term
but
the
chief
justice,
being
chief
justice
by
the
fact
that
he
has
the
minimum
term
still
to
--
of
elective
office
to
run.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it
gives
him
a
better
break
at
the
polls
if
he's
the
chief
justice.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
(inaudible)
for
reelection.
it's
very
nice,
practical,
political
answer
though.
the
--
i
think
you
get
to
a
problem
with
this
--
with
the
double
legislation
in
this
field
and
i
think
this
court
dealt
in
part
with
it
in
cole
versus
young
in
terms
of
federal
statutes
in
question
of
whether
or
not
it
would
allow
the
federal
government
to
go
beyond
in
a
particular
case
and
apply
a
rather
ruthless
application
of
a
man
being
fired
rather
than
using
a
longer
and
more
cumbersome
and
more
protective
system
for
firing.
in
cole
versus
young,
which
i
think
this
court
started
to
recognize
that
if
there
are
two
ways
for
the
government
to
accomplish
an
end,
that
it
should
accept
the
one
which
does
the
least
violence.
and,
in
the
state
of
arizona,
here,
an
undue
burden
is
put
upon
the
individual
to
sign
a
loyalty
oath
or
sign
this
oath
without
--
when
there's
no
real
effective
need
for
it
because
it
would
be
a
crime
in
any
event.
but,
it
places
him
in
a
position
where
he
doesn't
know
what
his
conduct
may
be.
one
further
matter,
don't
mistake
our
position
in
terms
of
our
claim
to
the
first
amendment
in
terms
of
the
particular
individual
appellant,
mrs.
elfbrandt's
position,
vis-à-vis
section
(e).
on
hers,
it
is
a
religious
dissuasion
of
--
as
set
forth
by
justice
fortas,
i
believe,
your
--
an
explanation
and
i
wish
the
record
would
be
very
clear
that
we
don't
withdraw
that
claim.
we
bring
that
claim
before
you
that
there's
a
violation
by
a
lack
of
procedural
due
process
of
her
ability
to
explain
her
position.
one
other
thing
on
that
matter
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no,
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
that's
right.
the
hortatory
oath.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no
objection.
the
oath
--
as
containing
section
(e)
where
she
could
not
explain
why,
vis-à-vis
the
provisions
of
(e),
what
her
position
is,
she
objects
to
it
because
there
she
claims
her
religious
affiliations
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
--
may
be
involved.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no.
and
there's
no
record
in
this
regard
and
therefore
i
may
not
speak
on
it.
no
record
was
made
on
this,
not
within
the
statement
of
facts
of
this
case
as
set
forth.
notice,
vis-à-vis
the
question
of
the
interpretation
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona,
notice
that
in
the
duran
case,
what
you
accomplish
was
that
the
attorney
general
came
back
with
a
representation
that
the
oath
--
the
wording
of
the
oath
submitted
to
the
individuals
was
changed.
and,
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
state
of
arizona.
what
we
have
is,
so
far,
two
changes
in
the
wording
by
two
decisions
before
the
supreme
court,
one
on
advocacy
and
the
other
on
aid.
and
our
statute
is
very
loose
in
the
word
of
“aid”
bringing
you
within
the
prescription
and
all
the
remainder
of
the
words
are
still
left
with
vagueness.
what
type
of
organization?
what
type
of
membership?
what
type
of
organization
having
one
of
its
purposes
the
forcible
overthrowwhat
in
substance
is
our
position
unless
the
court
has
some
questions?
