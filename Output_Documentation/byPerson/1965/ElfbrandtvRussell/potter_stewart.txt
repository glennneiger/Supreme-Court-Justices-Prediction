stewart
mr.
morgan,
the
oath
is
simply
the
oath
that
appears
on
page
9
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
an
oath
that
is
very
similar
to,
if
not
identical
with
the
oath
that
all
federal
officeholders
taken.
justice
potter
stewart
traditional
oath
for
government
employees?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
the
statutorial
form
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
only
oath
involved
here.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
your
case
would
be
the
same
whether
or
not
there
was
an
oath,
if
they
--
if
section
(e)
just
said
“if
any”
--
or
just
--
if
it
just
took
out
“having
taking
a
form
of
oath
or
affirmation
proscribed
by
this.”
justice
potter
stewart
with
your
case
would
be
exactly
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
attacking
(e).
you're
not
attacking
the
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
she's
a
quaker?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
gather
it
wasn't
to
the
taking
the
oath
which
she
objected
because
she
had
the
choice
of
affirming,
didn't
she?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
wasn't
she
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
she
has
--
she's
making
no
attack
here
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment,
the
protection
of
free
exercise
of
religion,
is
she?
justice
potter
stewart
and
anybody
has
the
choice
of
affirming
rather
than
taking
an
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
but
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
the
state
of
arizona
had
good
reason
or
no
reason
to
pass
this
law
as
--
that
question
as
such
isn't
really
the
business
of
this
court,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
operation
of
this
law
results
in
the
violation
of
some
of
these
constitutional
rights
then
it
does
and
under
that
extent,
pro
tanto
it's
invalid.
but
whether
or
not
a
state
has
a
good
reason
or
a
bad
reason
or
no
reason
to
pass
a
law
is
as
such
no
business
of
this
court
because
it's
no
business
of
the
united
states
constitution,
isn't
that
right?
let's
say
a
state
passed
a
law,
licensing,
snake
charmers
and
you
show
there
are
no
snakes
in
the
whole
state
but
that's
of
no
--
that's
no
business
of
ours,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
we
clear
that
no
hearing
is
available
here?
justice
potter
stewart
your
--
the
person
who
brought
this
suit
is
a
tenured
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
school
teacher
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
behalf
of
herself
and
other
similarly
situated,
isn't
it?
on
behalf
of
herself
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
all
other
govern
--
arizona
employees.
justice
potter
stewart
she
is
now.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
suppose
a
state
can,
if
it
wants
to,
decide
that
it
doesn't
want
to
have
its
own
employees,
people
who
are
either
dangerous
or
unstable,
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
if
somebody
doesn't
want
to
--
if
somebody
is,
falls
into
one
of
those
categories
and
for
that
reason
can't
take
this
oath
without
committing
perjury,
he
doesn't
need
to
refuse
to
take
the
oath.
he
could
just
resign
and
find
private
employment.
he
could
find
employment
in
the
state
which
doesn't
require
those
conditions
of
its
employees,
can't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
person
obviously
doesn't
like
public
employment
under
condition
of
it
in
arizona.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
many
other
states
which
don't
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
have
these
conditions.
justice
potter
stewart
university
professors
do
not
have
tenure
in
the
state
of
arizona,
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
much
trouble
in
getting
faculty
down
there?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
of
--
what
government?
that's
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
either?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
way
chief
justiceship
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
the
man
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
man
whose
election
comes
up
next.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it?
i
asked
you
right
at
the
outset
whether
--
because
of
her
religion,
she
object
as
to
taking
an
oath
as
such
and
you
said,
“well
no,
she
didn't.”
justice
potter
stewart
she
confirmed
it.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
what
particular
part
of
her
religious
beliefs
would
--
