mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
a
good
idea
to
consider
as
our
constitution
directs
us
to
return
to
basic
principles
and
in
this
case,
to
return
to
the
law
itself.
there
are
three
things
which
are
prohibited
which
are
made
crimes.
one
is
the
act
of
overthrowing
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
aiding
in
the
commission
of
an
act
to
overthrow
state
government
by
force
or
violence.
i
think
it
is
admitted
but
certainly
not
attacked
that
this
is
a
valid
piece
of
legislation.
the
second
prohibition
is
against
advocating
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
statute
is
limited
to
the
word
“advocate.”
the
third
prohibition
is
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
other
organization,
knowing
that
it
has
for
one
of
its
purposes,
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
these
prohibitions
apply
to
all
citizens
of
the
state
of
arizona
generally
and
specifically
to
all
public
employees
by
reason
of
two
different
statutes.
the
statute
relative
to
public
employees
has
been
attacked,
first
of
all,
on
the
basis
that
provides
for
no
administrative
due
process
that
a
person
may
lose
his
possession
without
having
a
chance
to
explain
at
the
administrative
and
procedural
level
his
reasons
why
he
does
not
wish
to
take
an
oath.
i
think
it
is
simply
and
best
put
in
the
dissent
in
nostrand
versus
little
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
administrative
process
can
serve
no
purpose.
no
tucson
school
board,
no
gila
bend
city
council,
no
city
of
phoenix
council
could
excuse
a
person
and
say,
“alright,
you
can
work
and
get
paid
if
you
don't
take
the
oath.”
they
simply
do
not
have
that
authority.
this
is
not
a
forum
in
which
explanations
or
defense
would
do
any
possible
good
to
either
the
administrative
agency
or
the
person.
there
is
no
function
to
be
served
by
allowing
or
requiring
that
somebody
explain
or
defend
to
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
nothing
can
be
accomplished
by
the
statute,
if
no
right
which
previously
existed
was
taken
away
and
no
new
right
is
created,
thus
the
status
of
the
person
has
not
changed.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
he
can
be
fired
from
public
employment
for
being
a
democrat
or
a
republican.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
at
the
time
that
it
is
taken.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
you
have
a
concomitant
fact
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
what
purpose
could
a
hearing
do?
for
that
matter,
what
could
a
purpose
in
a
--
could
a
hearing
at
a
court
do?
is
this
court
to
require
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
go
to
a
superior
court
and
get
a
declaratory
judgment
on
a
organization,
the
makeup
of
which
or
the
membership
of
which
or
the
purposes
of
which
nobody
knows?
what
can
anybody
do?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
you
can't
lose
your
job
until
you
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
have
been
convicted
in
a
court
of
law
as
a
part
of
the
criminal
process.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
he
can
only
be
fired
if
he
were
convicted
of
committing
perjury.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
he
can't
be
fired
by
the
agency.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
he
signs
the
oath,
he
can't
be
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
touched
by
the
agency.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
cannot
be
paid.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
he
cannot
be
fired.
he
can
only
be
suspended
from
receiving
remuneration,
but
he
cannot
be
fired
for
refusal
to
sign
the
oath.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
it
have
been
precisely
drawn
in
this
case.
the
tucson
school
board
was
advised
that
they
had
no
right
to
discharge
mrs.
elfbrandt.
the
most
that
they
could
do
was
suspend
her
from
payment
and
she
is
still
teaching
where
she
has
been.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
frankly
do
not
know.
i
think
we
may
have
some
old
wobblies
back
and
among
us.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
but
there
is
no
organized
party
in
arizona.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
as
part
of
the
same
statute,
it
cannot
qualify
as
a
legitimate
political
party.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
communist
party
of
united
states.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there's
some
question
as
to
that,
i
suppose,
as
a
factual
matter.
i
don't
know.
but
there
--
last
time,
there
was
a
communist
party
appearing
on
the
ballot
in
arizona,
i
think
it
was
in
1944
or
1948.
i'm
not
sure.
none
has
appeared
since
then
even
though,
in
the
intervening
period,
it
probably
illegal
to
could
have
qualified.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
he
will
be
in
the
same
position
as
you
placed
the
union
official
in
the
douds
case.
he
can
resign
from
the
organization
and
then
sign
the
oath.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
he
cannot
be
convicted
unless
he
knows
that
it
is
--
well,
the
fact
as
it
has
been
cited
by
a
committee
is
of
no
bearing.
we
do
not
have
the
louisiana
situation
of
any
presumption
or
--
of
either
the
attorney
general
opinions
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
hearing.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
are
times,
i
suppose,
in
any
criminal
act
where
your
chance
of
being
proved
guilty
or
innocent
depends
upon
your
knowledge
and
your
convincing
the
jury
of
your
particular
knowledge.
if
he
knows
that
it's
not
an
organization
or,
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
it
is
not
an
organization
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence,
he
is
not
guilty
of
a
crime.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that's
the
attorney
general's
opinion
nor
to
be
hearsay
wouldn't
even
be
admissible
in
evidence
against
the
man.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
believe
they
would,
yes.
the
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
attorney
general
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
believe
it
is
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
a
different
aspect
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
had
a
right
to
prohibit
its
members
from
becoming
or
being
associated
with
organizations.
the
advisability
of
the
possible
dangers
does
not
go
to
the
criminal
conviction
necessarily
as
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reason
for
the
law
at
all.
that
was
the
argument
that
was
being
answered
in
that
particular
phraseology,
in
that
particular
section.
and
i
think
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
the
decision
is
likely
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
always
have
to
be
read
by
their
entire
act.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
oath
which
is
required
of
all
public
employees
of
the
united
states
is
subject
to
a
specific
section
of
the
united
state
code,
title
18
section
1621,
which
report
--
which
makes
it
a
crime
punishable
by
five
years
imprisonment,
to
make
a
false
statement
is
not
perjury,
to
make
a
false
statement
when
required
to
make
a
statement
by
law
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
followed
by
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
would
include
future
conduct.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
can
think
of
none.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
statute
says
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
shall
be
punished
as
for
perjury,
and
that
just
really
means
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
for
14
years.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it's
simply
a
definition
of
what
the
perjury
statute
means
and
our
legislature
can
call
any
crime
by
any
name.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
designating
something
as
perjury
means
it
has
to
be
an
oath
sworn
to
an
open
court.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
law
says,
“shall
be
punished
as”
for
perjury.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
can
say
there's
no
difficulty
in
that.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
think
every
united
states
employee
is
under
the
same
burden,
but
they
take
this
oath
and
they
then
become
a
member.
they
can
be
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
code,
which
in
effect
is
a
punishment
for
perjury.
by
calling
it
perjury,
i
think,
does
not
raise
a
constitutional
issue.
if
the
state
has
a
right
to
prevent
its
employees
from
either
advocating
or
committing
acts
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
becoming
members,
if
it
can
make
that
a
crime,
then
what
they
call
it
or
the
length
of
term
is
hardly
a
constitutional
issue.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it's
merely
a
name.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
these
i
do
not
know.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
are
and
the
other
law
has
--
contains
a
higher
penalty.
it's
up
to
20
years
and
the
punishment
for
perjury
is
only
14.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
only
particular
reason
i
think,
is
found
in
subsection
(a)
so
that
all
employees
will
have
a
chance
to
read
this,
to
present
it
as
a
unified
thing.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
legislative
draftsmanship
and
technique.
everybody
is
under
the
same
burden.
a
choice
can
try
--
the
state
could
prosecute
a
public
employee
under
either
one,
but
not
under
both
like
other
statutes
in
the
state
of
arizona
which
we've
pointed
out.
i
think
this
is
just
a
question
of
legislative
draftsmanship
and
technique
to
--
they
belong
in
different
sections
of
the
code.
one
is
a
criminal
law,
title
13,
the
other
is
title
38
which
applies
to
public
employees.
i
think
it's
merely
a
question
of
draftsmanship.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
i
think
i
doubt
it.
i
doubt
if
there
even
are
any
now.
i
don't
know,
but
there
is
only
a
one
time
we
had
some
trouble
in
arizona.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
but
there's
no
relationship
to
that
whatsoever.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
past
activity
would
be
of
no
bearing
anyway,
no,
they're
certainly
nothing.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
as
our
supreme
court
said,
membership
in
the
arizona
law,
is
according
to
what
you
have
said
membership
means
under
the
smith
act.
it
has
to
be
active
membership
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
and
i
don't
think
they've
had
any
chapter
meetings
for
some
time.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
believe
you've
so
said
in
scales
and
yates.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
we
have,
in
our
decision,
in
effect,
tried
to
incorporate
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
your
decision.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
the
first
decision,
it
specifically
mentioned
those
cases.
it
stated
that
the
legislature
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
knew
of
them
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
that
is
the
position
the
state
took
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
that
that
is
what
the
meaning
should
be
and
that
is
what
we
take
here.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
has
referred
to
the
case
and
said
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
its
language,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
that
the
legislature
was
aware
of
the
language
of
these
cases.
although
the
legislature
did
not
specifically
mention
them,
it
did
say
that
it
had
considered
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
but
they
would
be
so
advised
by
the
attorney
general's
office,
and
they
were
advised
in
the
state
argument
that
this
is
the
meaning
we
want,
what
you
have
said,
and
that
is
what
we
would
say
to
this
court
today,
that
we
would
go
by
your
decisions
in
these
matters.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
as
a
superimposition
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
the
same
way
as
this
court
did
for
maryland
in
the
duran
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
aid
is
--
aid
in
the
commission
of
an
act.
it's
not
aid
as
it
appears
in
baggett
versus
bullitt.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
and
advocacy
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
advocacy
wasn't
really
raised
in
the
first
case,
i
don't
believe.
it
was
only
discussed
in
the
remand.
in
other
words,
the
vagueness
issue
was
not
either
strongly
argued,
it
was
raised
but
wasn't
considered
so
much
in
the
first
decision
as
it
was
in
the
second
in
light
of
the
remand
of
this
court
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
specifically
referring
to
it.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i'll
have
to
find
out
which
case
that
is.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
this
is
the
first
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
because
if
they,
there
was
another
decision,
there
was
another
(inaudible)
of
the
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
i
think
no,
it's
found
on
page
44.
we
assume
that
the
legislature
was
not
unaware
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
--
decisions,
pardon
me.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
membership
was
not
considered
in
that
case
and
perhaps
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
was
never
been
fully
considered.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
do
not
believe
it
has
that
right
to
do
so.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
believe
it
went
on
in
its
later
decisions,
the
second
one.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
advocacy
was
in
the
first
decision.
membership
was
more,
i
believe,
in
the
second.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there,
they
go
into
this
guiltless
knowing
behavior
and
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i'm
sorry.
seven
--
the
second
one
is
mostly
concerned
with
vagueness.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
cannot
recall
any
specific
question.
this
is
always
our
approach.
that's
the
decisions
of
this
court,
first
of
all,
as
to
advocacy
and
then
it's
to
act
to
the
membership
should
be
the
guidelines.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
don't
know
how
much
of
an
issue
was
actually
made
in
membership,
frankly,
i
don't,
can't
recall.
i
have
the
briefs
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
arizona?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
arising
out
of
this
law,
no
one
has
been
prosecuted
and
there
are
no
other
pending
cases.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
nobody
else
has
raised
the
issue,
they
say,
they
haven't.
i
have
no
idea
how
many
--
how
many
persons
in
the
state
of
arizona
might
have
left
employment
because
of
this
or
not.
nobody
would
have
any
idea.
i
think
in
the
questions,
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
people
might
have
left
and
nobody
knew
why.
and
this
might
very
well
happened
if
people
did
object
to
it.
our
appendix
does
show
that
there
was
a
pretty
heavy
turnover
in
state
government.
it
suggests
some
of
the
reasons
there
for.
i
think
mr.
morgan
in
his
opening
argument,
almost
asked
this
court
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
every
public
servant
in
every
state
have
civil
service
tenure.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
such
right.
public
employees
in
the
state
of
arizona
by
enlarge
do
not.
university
professors
do
not
and
they'd
be
fired
by
the
board
of
regents
for
--
or
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
of
regents
seems
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
universities.
suppose
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
university
professors,
not
by
statute.
i
am
not
completely
familiar
with
the
regulations
of
the
board
of
regents,
but
not
by
statute.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
they
may
be
discharged
by
the
board
of
regents
when
it
appears
to
be
the
board
--
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
of
regents,
in
the
best
interest
of
the
university.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
apparently
not
and
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
it.
but
the
schools
have
increased
considerably
in
size
and
i
assume
that
the
staffs
had
increased
in
proportion.
we
have
had
bills
introduced
in
the
legislature
to
limit
the
number
of
students.
i
don't
know
if
that
has
any
relation
to
the
number
of
faculty
members
available
or
just
the
physical
plans
involved.
as
i've
pointed
out,
most
state
employees
have
no
tenure
rights.some
are
required
to
by
virtue
of
agreements
of
the
federal
government.
one
agency
has
it
pretty
much
on
its
own,
for
no
particular
reason
except
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
politics.
and
in
concurrence
with
this,
they
passed
a
hatch
act
of
it's
--
of
their
own.
i
think
this
is
of
some
importance
in
our
consideration.
the
federal
government
has
severely
limited
the
area
of
expression
and
association
and
activity
of
federal
government
employees
and
millions
of
state
government
employees
by
their
hatch
act
which
prohibits
them
from
talking
in
an
area
which
is
certainly
of
governmental
interest
no
matter
how
you
look
at
this
clear
and
present
danger
argument.
a
person
is
forbidden
to
take
an
active
part
of
the
political
management
or
in
political
campaigns.
a
government
--
federal
government
employee
is
forbidden
to
participate
in
any
strike
or
to
assert
the
right
to
strike
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
agency,
both
under
the
hatch
act
--
both
in
title
v,
united
states
code,
section
118,
one
is
(i)
and
the
other
is
(p).
the
congress
has
saw
--
seen
fit
to
regulate
the
association
of
many
of
its
employees
and
their
activities
in
a
certainly
regulated
free
speech
of
governmental
employees.
they
have
allowed
exceptions
in
the
area
around
washington
for
local
political
activity
that
by
enlarged,
government
employees
cannot
take
an
active
part
in
politics.
and
any
state
employee
of
any
agency
receiving
federal
funds
is
under
the
same
prohibition.
we
had
state,
damon,
fiche,
welfare
and
employment
security,
many
other
state
agencies.
i
think
that
that
is
a
clear
example
of
the
court's
attitude
that
every
now
and
then,
the
best
interest
of
the
people
have
to
be
placed
above
the
particular
interest
of
a
few
of
the
people
in
either
freedom
of
speech
or
in
freedom
of
association.
i
don't
think
any
of
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
handled
in
this
particular
area
would
be
any
indication
that
our
law
is
invalid.
the
cases
which
have
been
rejected
recently
dombrowski
versus
pfister
from
louisiana.
the
language
used
there
was
advocate,
abet,
advice,
or
teach
the
overthrow,
anyone
to
overthrow
or
destroy
by
revolution,
force
and
violence,
or
other
unlawful
meanings.
and
later
on
refers
to
unconstitutional
or
illegal
means.
here
in
arizona,
the
acts
prohibited
are
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
and
that's
it,
beside
from
actual
acts
or
aiding
in
the
commission
of
an
actual
act.
in
the
washington
case,
baggett
versus
bullitt,
which
this
court
apparently
was
interested
in
its
remand
order.
the
particular
law
involved
was
interpreted
and
i
think
reasonably
accurately
that
persons
require
--
are
required
to
swear
that
they
understand
this
oath
and
they
might
reasonably
conclude
that
any
person
who
aids
the
communist
party
or
who
teaches
or
advices
known
members
of
the
party
is
a
subversive
person
because
such
teaching
or
advice
may
now
or
at
some
future
date
aid
the
activities
of
the
parties.
the
arizona
law
simply
does
not
have
the
same
language.
it
cannot
be
compared
to
baggett
versus
bullitt
because
it
is
simply
not
the
same
law.
it
doesn't
say
the
same
thing
and
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
comparison
between
a
law
and
--
one
law
and
another
and
the
comparison
fails,
the
laws
must
stand.
there
are
some
mentioned
of
the
bill
of
attainder,
both
in
the
brief
and
in
the
arguments.
i
think
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
brown
completely
answers
the
problem.
the
federal
statute
issued
then
anybody
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
five
years
prior
to
becoming
a
union
official
was
guilty
of
a
crime.
the
only
choice
he
had
was
to
quit
the
union
or
incur
a
criminal
liability.
this
court
compared
it
to
the
older
act
sustained
in
the
american
communications
association
versus
douds
where
there
was
no
fiver
year
prior
period
mentioned
and
stated
that
the
intention
was
to
forestall
future
dangerous
conduct
and
that
there
was
no
one
who
by
a
voluntary
alteration
of
the
loyalties
which
impel
him
to
action
can
become
eligible
to
sign
the
affidavit.
we
cannot
conclude
that
this
action
is
a
bill
of
attainder.
we
have
the
same
thing
in
arizona.no
past
conduct
is
commented
on
in
any
way.
it
cannot
be
the
basis
for
any
separation
from
public
employment.
so,
we
simply
do
not
have
a
bill
of
attainder
issue.
as
i
said
before,
i
think
there
is
certainly
no
court
or
public
opinion.
a
person
may
not
re
--
sign
the
oath,
may
refuse
for
any
number
of
reasons,
and
nobody
need
ever
know
about
it.
the
only
reason
why
it
is
known
is,
if
they
choose
to
make
the
issue
themselves.
and
i
think
having
chosen
to
become
a
(inaudible),
they
cannot
complain
about
it.
i
simply
think
that
there
are
no
prior
decisions
of
this
court
which
would
indicate
that
the
very
simple
and
clear
language
of
the
arizona
law
is
unconstitutional.
we
have
gotten
rid
of,
by
anticipation,
the
words
which
were
found
to
be
vague
in
cramp
versus
the
board
of
public
instruction,
"aid,
abet,
advice,
or
lend
counsel
or
assistance
to”
is
not
in
our
law.
we
don't
have
the
words
that
were
found
defective
in
the
washington
statute
in
baggett
versus
bullitt.
we
don't
have
the
complicated
machinery
of
presumption
of
guilt
by
membership
in
an
organization
that
might
have
been
cited
by
non-activity
americans
--
not
(inaudible)
--
pardon
me,
the
committee
for
un-american
activities
that
was
part
of
louisiana
law
condemned
in
the
dombrowski
case.
we
have
no
machinery
whereby
the
attorney
general
or
anybody
else
goes
out
and
investigates
or
questions
people
about
activities.
the
arizona
legislature
was
quite
clear
in
its
--
the
statement
of
a
judiciary
committee,
that's
part
of
our
appendix,
saying
that
these
things
are
really
the
job
of
the
federal
government
and
they
ought
to
do
it
and
let
them
do
it.
the
only
thing
that
the
arizona
legislature
created
were
three
simple
crimes,
the
first
one,
there
can
be
no
question
about
it.
the
second
one
i
think
is
also
not
subject
to
any
serious
doubt
whatsoever.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
either
acting
to
overthrow
or
aiding
in
the
commission
of
an
act
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that's
the
first
one.
the
other
one
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
state
of
arizona
or
the
united
states.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
either
or.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
no.
in
our
law,
it's
only
state
of
arizona.
i'm
sorry.
the
government
of
this
state
or
any
of
its
political
subdivisions,
yes,
advocating
the
overthrow.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
pardon
me,
a
person
who
(inaudible)
--
knowingly
or
willfully
advocates
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
of
the
government
of
this
state
or
any
of
its
political
subdivisions.
and,
the
third
one
is
a
person
who
knowingly
or
willfully
becomes
or
remains
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
the
same
somewhat
lengthy
section
that
mr.
morgan
earlier
read,
or
it's
successors
or
of
any
other
--
any
of
its
subordinate
organizations
or
of
any
other
organization
having
for
one
of
its
purposes
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
arizona
and
said
person
had
knowledge
of
said
unlawful
purpose
of
said
communist
party
of
the
united
states
or
of
said
subordinate
organ
--
or
other
organization.
so,
it's
actual
acts
or
aiding
in
the
commission
of
an
act.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
the
first
decision,
yes,
but
they
were
special
concurrences
and
they're
somewhat
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
by
--
it
may
not
in
a
loyalty
oath
requirement
such
as
this
one,
make
refusal
to
take
the
oath
a
conclusive
basis
for
exclusion
from
public
service.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
by
our
own
civil
rights
act,
they
may
not
do
it
on
the
basis
of
either
sex
or
color
or
religion.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
unless
there
is
some
intervening
special
statute,
some
agencies
are
protected
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
would
doubt
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
or
discriminatory
basis.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
they
would
--
that
you
--
i
believe
most
agencies
and
public
bodies
can
fire
the
people
and
may
need
--
give
no
reason.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
they
could
show
a
pattern
of
discrimination
there
might
be
an
issue.
in
other
words,
if
people
were
discriminated
against
on
a
continual
basis
in
such
a
way,
there
could
be
a
pattern,
there
might
be
an
equitable
remedy.
there's
no
statutory
remedy
and
the
matter
has
never
been
decided
by
our
supreme
court.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
i
believe
our
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
misinterpreted
the
state
in
the
record
in
the
pleadings.
as
mr.
morgan
has
said,
it's
not
here
so
much
because
she
has
any
direct
personal
objection.
i
think
he
went
a
little
bit
off
on
that.
this
was
brought
as
a
class
action
but
i
believe
he
said
here
today
that
it
wasn't
a
personal
objection
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
attack
was
brought
on
the
total
statute
as
part
of
the
religious
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
even
though
there
was
no
personal
direct
religious
feelings
as
far
as
they
--
the
specific
oath
was
concerned,
if
it
had
been
divorced
from
the
rest
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
way
mr.
justice
bernstein
felt
was
that
--
i
think
he
believed
that
her
belief
was
confined
solely
to
her
religious
objection
to
an
oath,
as
a
religious
objection,
in
other
words,
personal
to
her
only.
but,
i
disagree
with
his
conclusions
entirely
that
a
person
--
i
believe
it
could
happen
where
a
person
could
be
disqualified
for
an
employment
solely
because
of
religion
and
that
there
is
nothing
particularly
unconstitutional
in
that.
for
instance,
the
only
crime
in
our
constitution
is
one
which
arose
out
of
a
religious
belief
and
is
still
imposed
by
people
solely
on
religious
ground.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
only
arizona
crime
in
the
constitution
is
polygamy.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
but
i
believe
there
are
some
--
there
could
be
religions
of
such
a
type
of
belief
that
they
could
not
legitimately
be
allowed
to
hold
office.
there
are
still
perhaps,
in
india
today,
people
who
by
their
religion
believe
in
ritual
assassination.
this
is
a
religious
belief.
i
don't
think
just
putting
the
name
religion
on
it
immediately
removes
it
from
state
activity.
there
are
people
whom
by
religion
might
say
that
they
can
only
work
one
or
two
days
of
the
week
that
there
should
five
sabbaths.
well,
obviously,
if
everybody
else
in
the
state
is
working
five
or
six
days
a
week,
i
think
this
would
be
sufficient
grounds
that'll
exclude
them
from
employment,
that
they're
inefficient
and
unworkable
having
them
work
only
two
days
a
week.
they
may
say
that's
because
of
their
religion.
the
state
can
say,
“you
may
have
your
religion
but
if
it
interferes
with
the
government
so
much,
you've
got
to
take
your
choice.”
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
most
don't
work
on
saturday.
that's
getting
a
little
close.
it
might
be
considered
unreasonable
because
the
interference
with
the
governmental
activity
would
be
minimal.
i
think
it's
just
simply
a
question
of
balancing
the
judgment
at
all
times.
i
know,
in
the
army,
the
seventh
day
adventists
were
excused
from
military
duty
on
saturdays.
they
never
showed
up
in
formations
or
drill
or
parades,
and
the
army
got
along
with
them.
so,
i
presume
the
state
could
also.
incident
--
i
think
it's
simply
a
question
degree
and
not
of
being
absolute
in
one
way
or
the
other.
after
all,
we're
not
abridging
their
free
exercise
of
religion,
but
it
goes
back
to
the
old
statement
of
justice
holmes
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
be
--
talk
politics
but
not
a
right
to
be
a
policeman.
there
has
always
been
some
limitation
on
public
employment
activities
and
many
of
them
approach
the
area
of
the
otherwise
untouchable
constitutionally
protected
principles,
but
the
government
has
a
right
to
bargain
a
little
bit
in
the
interest
of
all
the
people
which
it
is
suppose
to
represent.
and,
i
don't
think
the
bargaining
it
has
done
in
this
case
is
in
any
way
unreasonable.
i
don't
think
it
even
begins
to
create
a
problem,
much
less
one
that
would
be
serious
enough
striking
down
a
law
such
as
the
one
which
the
arizona
legislature
passed.
i
believe
i
have
some
time
and
i
have
nothing
further
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
to
belong
to
any
organization
if
they
know
that
one
its
purposes
is
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
“knowingly”
it
says.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
specifically,
this
is
the
sedition
section
in
there,
as
13-707,
and,
"said
person
had
knowledge
of
said
unlawful
purpose
of
said
communist
party
or
of
said
subordinate
or
other
organization.”
the
unlawful
purpose,
of
course,
can
only
refer
to
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
which
is
the
clause
immediately
preceding.
so,
he'd
have
to
have
knowledge.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
and
it
applies
to
everyone.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
serves
practically
very
little
purpose.
i
think
it
serves
primarily
the
purpose
of
following
prior
legislative
acts,
such
as,
you
can
be
prosecuted
under
the
smith
act
but
a
federal
employee
can
also
be
prosecuted
by
virtue
of
violation
of
the
oath
of
office
which
he
takes.
they're
just
following
a
legislative
habit,
a
demand
on
the
part
of
professional
legislative
council
to
have
everything
in
league
and
in
order
and
to
get
the
information
to
the
public
employees
fairly
quick.
but
it
serves
no
real
practical
purpose.
i
don't
think
that
is
something
which
the
notice
would
create
a
constitutional
issue.
there
are
two
crimes
but
you
can
only
be
prosecuted
for
one
if
you're
a
public
employee.
and
of
course,
if
you're
a
citizen,
you
can
only
be
prosecuted
under
the
one.
but
the
burden
is
no
higher.
it
does
not
state
so
here,
but
the
penalty
for
perjury
in
arizona,
the
maximum
is
14
years.
the
maximum
for
sedition
under
the
other
act
is
20
years.
so,
there
is
no
higher
burden.
thank
you.
