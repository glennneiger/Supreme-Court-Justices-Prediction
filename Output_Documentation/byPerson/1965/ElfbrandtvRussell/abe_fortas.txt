justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
is
there
anything
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
record
that
shows
whether
at
the
time
a
prospective
state
employee
takes
this
oath,
there
is
any
reference
to
or
notice
of
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
when
--
how
does
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
take
your
time.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
the
phrase
in
the
law
that
says
--
requires
as
a
condition
to
its
punitive
application
or
disqualification
that
the
person
must
have
had
knowledge
of
said
unlawful
purpose
of
the
organization.
it
appears
on
page
10a
of
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
indication
as
to
what
the
state
view
is,
for
purposes
of
this
statute,
of
these
wobblies
that
you
referred
to
as
being
back
in
the
hills
by
which
i
understand
you
to
mean
the
numbers
of
iww?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
know
you
did.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
is
now.
what
--
is
there
anything
indicating
whether
the
state
would
regard
that
as
one
of
the
organizations
here,
membership
in
the
iww
in
the
years
past?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
when
does
membership
cease
some
of
those
fellows
that
used
to
be
back
in
the
hills
if
they're
not
still
there?
wouldn't
it
--
when
do
they
cease
being
members
of
the
iww?
justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
two
of
the
five
justices
--
there
are
five,
aren't
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
arizona?
that
two
of
the
five
justices
were
of
the
opinion
that
a
hearing
would
be
necessary,
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
would
be
necessary
prior
to
requiring
that
the
affidavit
be
signed
as
a
condition
of
public
employment.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
that
was
there.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
concurrences
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
however.
and
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
chief
justice
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
his
concurrence
said
that
the
statute
relevant
part
was
saved
here
because
of
--
there
was
an
opportunity
to
petitioner
to
obtain
a
hearing
under
some
other
law
because
she
was
a
school
--
temporary
school
teacher,
something
like
that,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
basic
premise
on
which
the
chief
justice's
concurrence
relied
was
that
it
cannot
constitutionally
deprive
people
of
an
opportunity
for
public
employment
if
the
basis
is
discriminatory
and
reasonable,
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
you
disagree
with
that
premise?
justice
abe
fortas
you
do?
is
it
your
proposition
--
is
it
your
submission
that
the
state
may
exclude
people
from
public
employment
on
any
basis
however
discriminatory?
justice
abe
fortas
otherwise,
they
may
do
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
i
take
it
that
you
do
take
the
issue
with
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
on
that
point,
that
is
to
say,
whether
a
person
may
be
deprived
of
an
opportunity
for
public
service
on
unreasonable
or
discriminatory
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
about
the
general
proposition.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
if
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
chief
justice
of
your
court
in
his
concurring
opinion
here
said
that
petitioner
represents
that
she
refuses
to
take
this
oath
because
of
the
moral
teachings
of
her
religion.
and
that
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
subversion
and
unless
an
opportunity
is
afforded
to
her
for
a
hearing
in
which
she
can
be
relieved
of
this
disqualification
upon
the
showing
that
her
refusal
to
sign
has
nothing
to
do
with
subversion.
unless
such
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
is
provided
then
the
statute
would
not
be
valid
at
least
as
applied
to
her.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court,
that
is
to
say,
an
issue
presented
by
a
person
who
says
that
she
is
being
deprived
of
her
right,
if
there
is
one,
to
have
a
crack
in
government
employment
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis
because
she's
not
being
given
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
in
which
he
can
show
that
her
refusal
to
sign
the
statute
has
no
connection
whatever
with
subversion
but
is
instead
based
on
religious
principles?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
question
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
the
state
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
the
state
could
constitutionally
provide
that
no
protestant
or
no
catholics
could
hold
public
office?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
excluding
--
state
law
excluding
people
who
won't
work
on
saturday?
