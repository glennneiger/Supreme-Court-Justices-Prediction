mr.
alfred
swedlaw
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
alfred
swedlaw.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
thank
you,
sir,
we
are
both
of
birmingham.
mr.
perrine,
my
colleague
and
i,
are
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
appellant,
mr.
james
e.mills.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
this
case
concerns
section
285
of
the
alabama
corrupt
practices
act,
regulating
election
practices.
and
specifically,
that
portion
of
the
act
which
provides
as
follows.
it
is
a
corrupt
practice
for
any
person
on
election
day
to
do
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes
for
or
against
the
election
or
nomination
of
any
candidate,
or
in
support
of
or
in
opposition
to
any
proposition
that
is
being
voted
on,
on
the
day
on
which
the
election
affecting
such
candidates
or
propositions
is
being
held.
mr.
mills
is
editor
of
the
birmingham
post-herald,
a
morning
newspaper
published
daily
in
birmingham,
alabama,
and
distributed
throughout
the
state
of
alabama.
the
circulation
of
this
paper
is
approximately
85,000
as
being
the
second
largest
newspaper
in
the
state.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes,
sir.
there's
an
afternoon
paper,
the
sister
paper
of
the
birmingham
post,
it's
the
birmingham
news
and
it
has
a
circulation
of
approximately
130,000,
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
this
is
the
only
morning
newspaper.
on
november
6
of
1962,
a
municipal
election
was
held
in
birmingham
to
determine
whether
the
existing
commission
form
of
city
government
would
be
retained
or
would
be
replaced
by
the
so-called
mayor-council
form.
mr.
mills
authored
an
editorial
which
was
published
on
election
day
in
his
newspaper.
the
editorial
appears
in
full
on
page
25
of
the
record
and
as
appendix
k
on
page
35
of
the
appellant's
brief.
in
this
editorial,
mr.
mills
criticized
the
then
mayor
of
birmingham
for
promising
pay
raises
to
city
employees
and
for
saying
that
he
would
instruct
city
employees
to
neither
give
out
news
to
nor
discuss
with
reporters
of
the
birmingham
post-herald,
or
its
sister
paper,
the
birmingham
news,
any
public
business.
the
mills
editorial
stated
that
the
proposed
pay
raises
were
--
was
another
good
reason
why
the
voter
should
vote
overwhelmingly
today
in
favor
of
mayor-council
government.
as
to
the
news
blackout
threatened
by
the
mayor,
the
editorial
comment
was,
if
mayor
hanes
displays
such
arrogant
disregard
of
the
public
right
to
know
on
the
eve
of
election,
what
can
we
expect
in
the
future
if
the
city
commission
should
be
retained.
birmingham
and
the
people
of
birmingham
deserve
a
better
break.
a
vote
for
mayor-council
government
will
give
it
to
them.
the
publication
of
this
editorial
marked
the
beginning
of
the
chain
of
events
ultimately
leading
to
our
appearance
here
this
morning.
a
criminal
complaint
was
filed
against
mr.
mills
on
november
the
13th,
1962
issued
from
the
jefferson
county
criminal
court
charging
mills,
head
by
the
editorial
in
question.
electioneered
or
solicited
votes
on
election
day
in
contravention
of
section
285
of
the
alabama
corrupt
practices
act.
if
guilty
of
this
misdemeanor
as
charged,
mr.
mills
is
subject
to
a
fine
of
not
more
than
$500
and
he
may
also
be
imprisoned
in
the
county
jail
or
sentenced
at
hard
labor
for
six
months,
but
not
more
than
six
months
on
behalf
of
the
county.
demurrers
to
the
complaint
were
filed
on
mills'
behalf,
testing
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
the
editorial
on
both
the
alabama
and
the
federal
constitutions.
the
lower
court
--
the
criminal
court
sustained
these
demurrers
thereby,
in
effect,
declaring
the
statute
as
applied
unconstitutional.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir,
that's
all.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
on
election
day,
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
statute
having
been
declared
unconstitutional,
as
provided
by
alabama
procedure,
the
state
appealed
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
that
section
285
clearly
applied
to
the
mills
editorial
and
that
the
statute
as
applied
was
constitutional
under
the
police
powers
for
the
state
of
alabama.
the
order
of
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
trial
court.
we
filed
a
timely
application
on
behalf
of
mr.
mills
and
this
was
overruled
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mills
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
this
court
by
its
order
of
december
the
6th,
1965,
postponed
jurisdiction
for
further
consideration
to
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
its
merits.
under
those
circumstances,
we
will
address
ourselves
first
to
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case
arises
because
on
its
phase,
the
judgment
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
does
not
necessarily
conclude
the
litigation
between
the
state
of
alabama
and
mr.
mills.
alabama
procedure
would
permit
mills
on
an
actual
trial
of
the
case
below
to
interpose
defenses
other
than
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
in
question.
in
reality,
however,
mills
has
no
other
defense
either
in
fact
or
in
law
to
the
charge
against
him.
he
freely
concedes
that
he
wrote
the
editorial
complained
of
and
caused
it
to
be
published
on
election
day.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
this
constituted
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
statute
as
thus
applied
is
constitutional.
therefore,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
federal
question,
that
is
the
constitutionality
or
not
of
the
alabama
statute
is
the
only
question
remaining
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
decided.
under
these
circumstances,
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
constituted
a
final
judgment
for
the
purposes
of
title
28
u.s.c.
section
1257.
in
the
case
of
pope
versus
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
company
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1953,
a
railroad
employee
invoking
the
federal
employers
liability
act
sued
his
employee
--
employer
for
injury
sustained
in
the
course
of
employment.
the
injuries
occurred
in
georgia
but
the
employee
sued
in
the
alabama
courts
and
the
railroad
filed
a
proceeding
to
restrain
the
alabama
action.
the
trial
court
sustained
the
general
demurrer
which
raised
the
provisions
of
the
federal
statute
as
a
bar
for
the
power
of
the
georgia
court
to
issue
the
injunction.
the
georgia
supreme
court
reversed
the
trial
court's
order
and
the
employee
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
as
an
out
case,
the
jurisdictional
question
in
pope
was
whether
or
not
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
was
final.
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
a
final
judgment
because
the
issue
was
right
for
adjudication.
there
is
hill.
the
petitioner
conceded
that
he
had
no
other
defense
in
opposed
and
that
his
case
rested
upon
his
claim
under
the
federal
statute
and
nothing
else.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
alabama
supreme
court,
judge
fortas,
has
so
construed
it
and
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
your
honor,
we
disputed
it
initially
in
the
court
below
but
the
application
of
the
statute
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
a
binding
construction
of
it
and
binding
on
this
court,
may
i
suggest,
to
the
same
effect
as
though
it
were
written
into
the
statute.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
this
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
didn't
quite
understand
you,
justice
harlan.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
oh
yes
sir,
we
can
then
oppose
that,
but
this
is
not
the
fact
where
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
defendant
authored
the
editorial.
mr.
mills,
the
defendant,
the
appellant
in
this
case
authored
the
editorial
and
caused
it
to
be
published.
so
in
truth,
we
have
no
further
defense.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
justice
white
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
we
have
not
been
convicted.
there
has
been
no
trial.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
oh
yes
sir,
we
would
plea
--
we
would
have
no
alternative,
there's
no
defense.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
well,
we
wouldn't
have
a
jury
trial
and
the
initial
procedure
would
be
without
a
jury
in
the
jefferson
county
criminal
court
if
we
lost
there
in
order
to
work
our
way
back
up
to
where
we
are
today,
we
would
go
to
the
--
to
the
circuit
court
and
there
we
could
demand
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir,
there
would
be
a
de
novo
procedure
and
losing
there,
we
would
then
be
permitted
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
losing
there
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
and
losing
there
to
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
suppose
that
they
--
that
they
could
your
honor.
it
would
be
set
aside
in
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
they
judge
the
facts
only
and
jury
tries
the
facts.
there
is
no
way
from
a
practical
standpoint,
justice
white.
there's
nothing
that
we
can
do
that
we
are
not
now
doing.
and
this
is
--
this
is
our
plea
as
to
the
finality
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama's
judgment.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir,
i
suppose
that
the
jury
could
acquit.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no
sir,
the
pope
case,
justice
white,
went
on
the
--
went
on
the
theory
that
the
judgment
was
final
even
though
it
was
a
demurrer
and
that
the
case
was
right
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
for
adjudication.
now
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
think
not,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
case
it
followed
in
1963,
the
curry
case
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
went
off
on
the
question,
initially,
the
main
rationale
of
the
decision
was
the
power
of
the
georgia
court
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
to
act.
but
it's
an
alternative
--
it's
an
alternate
basis
of
decision
in
the
curry
case,
the
court
cited
pope
and
relied
on
pope
which
was
apart
completely
from
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
to
act,
power
as
i
understand
it.
the
pope
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
oh,
yes
sir
and
the
alternate
basis
of
opinion
in
curry.
and
i
think
in
richfield
which
preceded
the
pope
case.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
we
think
--
we
think
this
is
very
true
and
a
very
cogent
reason.
the
dombrowski
case
of
course
involved
the
question
of
--
the
doctrine
of
abstention.
but
the
analogy
is
certainly
clear.
we
feel
that
mr.
mills
should
not
be
subjected
to
a
criminal
prosecution
and
conviction
in
order
to
obtain
a
declaration
of
his
constitutional
rights.
this
matter
has
--
it
began
in
1962
of
november,
some
two
and
a
half
years
have
already
elapsed
since
that
time
and
we
are
now
after
that
long
delay
here
in
the
supreme
court.
if
we
are
compelled
to
go
back
to
the
alabama
courts
and
went
our
way
through
the
torturous
appellate
procedure
to
get
back
here,
it
would
be
anticipated
that
another
two
or
two
and
a
half
years
would
expire.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
we
have
a
firm
determination
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
this
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
alabama's
police
power.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
exactly,
justice
black.
we
feel
that
not
only
--
not
only
would
this
be
an
intolerable
situation
insofar
as
the
appellant
is
concerned
but
there
are
other
rights
besides
those
of
mr.
mills
here
involved
as
in
the
dombrowski
case.
the
question
of
the
effect
that
the
supreme
court's
decision
has
had
on
first
amendment
rights
in
alabama
must
be
considered.
the
broad
sweep
of
the
alabama
corrupt
practices
act
to
encompass
an
editorial
has
necessarily
in
the
words
of
dombrowski
had
a
“chilling
effect”,
if
you
please,
on
the
alabama
press
generally.
the
blanket
of
silence
which
has
descended
upon
the
press
of
alabama
each
election
day
since
the
arrest
of
mr.
mills
continues
to
insulate
the
people
of
alabama
from
editorial
comment
and
press
information
to
which
we
feel
they
are
entitled
and
that
they're
entitled
to
this
without
restraint.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no
sir
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no,
justice
fortas.
we
think
that
the
first
amendment
applies
equally
to
any
form
of
expression
be
a
newspaper
or
a
chamber
of
commerce
publication,
or
the
handing
out
of
pamphlets.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
or
a
speech
why
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes,
and
we
see
no
distinction
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
and
with
reference
to
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
whatever
form
the
electioneering
may
take.
we
see
no
legitimate
legislative
purpose
in
this
sought
of
restraint.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
man
being
prosecuted
for
standing
within
20
or
30
feet
of
an
election
booth
and
blocking
or
harassing
people
coming
to
vote.
this
is
not
a
regulation
of
conduct.
this
is
a
regulation
of
speech.
and
we
see
no
legitimate
interest
for
the
state
of
alabama
in
such
restraint.
in
fact,
we
--
it's
our
contention
that
the
public
interest
lies
completely
in
the
other
direction.
not
in
the
direction
of
curtailing
expression
but
in
the
direction
of
giving
full
vent
to
public
expression
concerning
matters
of
general
interest
and
public
interest
elections
particularly.
now,
as
far
as
the
construction
of
the
statute
being
binding
on
this
court
irrespective
of
the
--
when
it's
emanated
--
the
expression
emanated,
it
is
binding
on
this
court,
the
alabama
supreme
court's
application
of
it.
this
was
decided
in
herndon
versus
lowry,
in
the
terminiello
case
just
to
the
same
effect
as
though
--
the
statute
had
said
that
no
editorial
shall
be
written
or
published
on
election
day.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
may
i
--
we're
getting
into
the
merits
of
our
case
which
is
perfectly
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
satisfactory,
and
i
should
--
i
would
be
happy
to
pursue
this
argument
further.
no
sir,
the
two
rather
blur
together
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
the
merits
of
our
case
are
rather
intermingle,
but
you're
absolutely
correct.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
well
the
only
justification,
justice
black
was
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
gave
for
this
statute
is
a
--
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
directly,
a
salutary
enactment
designed
to
prevent
last
minute
charges
and
countercharges.
now
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
futility
of
this
reasoning
is
apparent,
may
it
please
the
court.
you
don't
prevent
last
minute
charges
and
countercharges,
be
the
deadline
election
day
or
30
days,
or
60
days
or
90
days
before
election
day.
someone
always
has
the
last
word
before
time
runs
out.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no
sir,
we
concede
readily
that
the
alabama
corrupt
practices
act
does
have
a
valid
sphere
of
operation.
we
certainly
think
that
the
restriction
as
to
place
would
be
appropriate,
prevent
the
actual
harassment
of
a
voter.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
possibly
because,
your
honor,
that
there
are
certain
interest
that
the
state
has
in
--
and
oddly
that
is
a
--
an
election
is
not
disturbed
by
breach
of
peace
by
the
state.
by
a
criminal
offense,
we
don't
argue
that
the
--
that
the
right
of
free
speech
or
free
press
is
an
(voice

absolutely
right.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
possibly,
this
would
be
the
equivalent.
this
would
be
the
equivalent,
be
convicted
--
conviction
on
misdemeanor.
we
argue
for
a
complete
and
absolute
right
to
question.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
we
think
that
that
would
--
that
would
lend
the
validity.
we
tend
to
make
this
that
extensive.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
oh,
possibly
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
see.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
because
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
because
when
you're
--
may
it
please,
your
honor,
it
involves
something
physical.
it
involves
conduct.
it's
not
a
limitation
on
the
expression.
an
analogy
for
example
was
in
the
schneider
case,
i
think
it
was,
various
statutes
prohibiting
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
but
not
restraining,
not
a
physical
--
not
a
physical
blocking
of
a
polling
place.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
would
argue
most
vehemently
with
you
but
this
should
not
be
tolerated,
that
this
would
be
an
unwarranted
restriction.
i
would
--
this
would
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
with
100
feet,
i
don't
think
there's
any
magic
of
100
feet.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i'm
incomplete
in
terms,
your
honor.(voice

mr.
alfred
swedlaw
but
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far
here.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
would
take
that
position.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
go
nearly
that
far
in
this
case,
however,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
unless
there
is
a
breach
of
the
peace
--
unless
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
use
the
classic
test,
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
--
to
the
public
interest,
i
feel
that
there
should
be
no
limitation
or
restriction
on
freedom
of
expression
be
at
newspaper
or
otherwise.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
if
the
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
if
they're
not
blocking
traffic,
creating
hazards
to
the
public
peace,
creating
traffic
conditions
that
might
result
in
danger
to
the
public
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no
sir,
you
do
not.
there
is
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
there
is
no
such
a
question
involved
in
our
case,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
there
are
numerous
statutes
--
corrupt
practices
act
are
numerous.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
it
says
you
shall
not
publish
a
newspaper
editorial?
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
do
not
know
how
general
that
specific
provision
is,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
there
are
acts
of
this
nature
but
their
exact
content
--
there
has
been
no
construction.
we
know
this
but
we
have
found
no
cases
bearing
on
that
point.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
that
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir,
this
is
true.
we
feel
that
--
as
i've
said
in
the
schneider
case
trying
to
regulate
the
distribution
of
pamphlets
on
public
streets
under
the
guise
of
this
being
a
regulation
that
would
keep
the
street
from
being
littered.
and
this
statute
was
struck
down
under
the
guise
of
regulating
conduct,
those
statutes
regulated
free
expression.
now,
that's
exactly
what
is
happening
in
the
alabama
statute.
it
would
be
only
of
small
step
from
the
alabama
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
mills
case
to
say
--
well,
for
a
benevolent
legislature
to
say
well
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
we
think,
in
this
--
in
times
of
trouble
and
stress
such
as
we
are
now
enduring,
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
that
there'd
be
some
surcease,
some
respite
from
all
of
these
tension,
all
of
the
bad
news.
and
therefore,
let's
say
that
only
on
monday,
wednesday,
and
friday,
we'll
have
no
editorial
appear
in
newspapers,
we'll
have
no
television,
news
broadcast
of
any
sort
because
the
people
are
entitled
to
this
sort
of
euphoric
atmosphere
in
which
their
tranquility
is
undisturbed.
this
is
the
danger
of
the
mills
case
that's
decided
by
supreme
court
of
alabama.
this
is
speech
control.
if
you
will,
this
is
thought
control.
if
i
may
just
take
a
moment
and
quote
from
the
mills'
opinion
to
give
the
court
an
idea
of
what
was
here
involved.
this
court,
this
is
the
alabama
supreme
court.
this
court
holds
in
accordance
with
the
great
weight
of
authority
that
a
law
cannot
be
held
to
be
invalid
because
unreasonable
unless
and
until
it
appears
beyond
reasonable
controversy
that
it
necessarily
impairs
to
the
point
of
practical
destruction,
a
right
safeguarded
by
the
constitution.
as
it
already
has
been
pointed
out,
the
law
under
consideration
lies
within
the
police
power
field
and
impairs,
and
please
listen
--
and
impairs
only
the
right
of
free
expression.
now,
by
whatever
theory
or
by
whatever
rationale
this
decision
is
tested,
we
think
that
the
alabama
statute
as
applied
to
mr.
mills
was
faux.
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
this
is
fundamentally
objectionable,
is
that
--
is
the
assumption
by
the
court
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
provide
the
voters
of
alabama
an
intellectually,
antiseptic
atmosphere
on
election
day.
this
is
not
true.
this
is
a
monstrous
assumption,
if
you
will,
in
a
free
society.
this
is
the
danger
of
the
mills
case.
the
gradual,
by
slow
degrees,
encroachment
on
first
amendment
rights
by
the
states
or
by
the
congress,
it
should
not
be
tolerated
except
in
very
clear
cases.
and
then
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
roth
case,
the
door
should
be
left
ajar
only
for
the
purpose
of
restricting
what
have
to
be
restricted
in
the
public
interest,
and
then
the
door
should
be
tightly
closed
because
the
matter
of
free
expression
is
not
just
free
expression,
it
is
the
essence
as
this
court
has
recognized,
it
is
the
essence
of
self-government.
and
we
ask
that
the
court
take
jurisdiction
and
then
it
reversed
the
alabama
supreme
court,
my
colleague,
mr.
perrine
will
argue
the
vagueness
objection
to
the
statute.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
rebuttal,
mr.
hawkins
has
stated
that
in
his
judgment,
various
acts
which
the
statute
by
its
terms
proscribed
would
not
be
so
construed
and
would
not
be
--
this
is
not
the
intendment
of
the
statute.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear
in
these
various
respects
and
this,
this
is
one
of
the
faults,
the
vagueness
fault
in
the
statute
that
it
brings
within
its
ambit
and
within
its
purview
otherwise
harmless
conduct
and
proscribes
it
and
makes
it
a
criminal
offense.
the
statute
does
not
require
that
it'd
be
done
with
a
criminal
intent.
the
statute
says
thus
and
so
shall
be
forbidden
on
election
day.
now,
one
of
the
concerns
of
the
state
apparently
and
mr.
hawkins
has
expressed
here
and
i
think
that
this
paternalistic
attitude
is
permeated
in
the
state's
position
throughout
these
proceedings.
questionably,
the
right
of
the
public
to
be
protected,
mr.
hawkins
said
that
he
thought
that
one
of
the
purposes
would
be
to
prevent
a
voter
from
forming
a
role
and
opinion.
now,
this
is
precisely
--
this
is
precisely
the
thought
--
that
sort
of
thing
that
we
are
urging
on
the
court
here
to
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
legislative
interest
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
protect,
thornhill
decided
that.
thornhill
decided
that
--
the
fact
that
people
might
be
persuaded
to
take
the
position
contrary
to
their
best
interest
or
to
adopt
an
indirect
opinion
are
not
dangers
which
government
has
any
right
to
prevent.
the
antiseptic
atmosphere
of
an
election
is
not
something
that
is
a
matter
of
legislative
interest
--
legitimate
legislative
interest.
there's
nothing
it
says
we
need
to
have
peaceful,
and
calm,
and
tranquil
atmospheres
on
election
day.
we
must
defend
out
--
like
to
speak
out
robustly
as
the
state
has
said,
even
to
the
point
--
as
this
court
has
said,
even
to
the
point
of
criminal
libel
unless
done
with
malice
as
this
court
held
in
the
garrison
case
with
regard
to
public
officials.
if
the
court
will
permit
with
the
remaining
time
we
have
at
hand,
we
should
like
to
revert
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
notwithstanding
that
the
state
is
in
effect
graciously
conceded
that
it
makes
no
issue
of
the
jurisdictional
question.
but
since
a
state
in
its
brief
has
made
certain
comments
and
distinctions,
for
example
the
state
has
made
much
of
the
--
of
an
alleged
distinction
on
the
finality
question
between
the
pope
case,
for
example,
in
our
case
and
that
this
case
is
a
criminal
procedure
whereas
in
pope,
criminality
was
not
involved.
we
submit
that
if
there
is
any
such
distinction,
it
lies
in
favor
of
the
appellant
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
it's
of
much
more
pertinence,
much
more
concerned
that
this
man,
that
mr.
mills
not
be
subjected
to
a
criminal
trial
and
risk
having
a
conviction
against
his
record
in
order
to
test
his
constitutional
rights.
the
distinction
is
not
made
in
the
statute.
section
1257
requires
no
distinction
such
as
the
state
would
urge
between
criminal
and
civil
proceedings.
now,
the
state
also
relies
on
the
polakow
case
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari,
not
decided,
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
denied.
and
in
polakow,
there
was
involved
the
procedure
of
indictment
against
certain
persons
in
alabama
for
selling
real
estate
without
a
license
as
prescribed
by
the
statute.
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
was
likewise
tested
by
demurrer
and
the
matter
went
to
the
supreme
court
on
certiorari
but
the
supreme
court
denied
the
writ.
now,
the
distinction
between
the
polakow
case
and
the
case
involved
is
a
fraud
that
appears
in
polakow.
the
defendant
there
had
other
defenses
to
interpose
in
a
trial
of
the
case.
that
is
not
true
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
case
involved.
moreover,
the
court
has
moved
away
from
polakow
to
the
point
that
it
maybe
said
that
polakow
has
by
being
ignored
been
overruled.
the
pope
case,
the
richfield
case,
the
curry
case
have
all
departed
at
least
implicitly
from
the
polakow
holding.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
threat
of
sanctions,
the
threat
of
first
amendment
restrictions,
can
even
more
or
can
almost
as
much
as
the
imposition
of
the
sanctions
themselves
infringe
upon
constitutional
rights.
as
late
as
last
month
in
the
fanny
hill
case,
for
example,
this
court
in
passing
on
the
--
on
its
jurisdiction
in
the
--
on
the
massachusetts
proceedings,
in
which
there
had
been
an
in
rem
declaration
of
obscenity
against
the
fanny
hill
book
but
there
had
been
no
prosecution,
there'd
been
no
criminal
trial,
been
no
criminal
conviction
albeit.
but
this
court
noted
that
the
declaration
of
obscenity
is
likely
to
have
a
serious
inhibitory
effect
on
the
distribution
of
the
book.
and
that
this
probable
effect
is
in
no
small
measure
derived
from
the
possible
collateral
uses
of
the
declaration
in
subsequent
prosecution
under
the
massachusetts
statute.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
polakow,
p-o-l-a-k-o-w
is
the
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
case,
yes
sir,
it's
cited
in
the
state's
brief
and
we
had
--
we
have
the
citation,
i
think
it's
319
u.s.--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
it's
319
u.s.
1155.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
319
u.s.
1155,
i
think.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
750
to
755.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
parallel
between
the
fanny
hill
case
and
the
mills
case
we
think
is
evident.
mr.
mills'
editorial
like
fanny
hill
stands
condemned
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
as
being
in
violation
of
state
law
and
thus
irrespective
of
what
may
or
may
not
happen
in
future
proceedings
below.
the
freedom
of
expression
is
now
seriously
impaired
just
as
this
court
felt
that
it
would
be
in
massachusetts
although
no
criminal
prosecutions
had
actually
occurred.
and
it
might
be
said
in
conclusion.
it
might
be
said
within
the
pope
case
for
example
for
all
that
appears
of
the
railroad
company
might
have
waived
its
injunction
proceedings
which
was
sanctioned.
and
these
are
possibilities,
but
the
practical
effect
of
this
situation,
as
we
have
said,
is
that
mr.
mills
has
been
tried
on
the
merits
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
and
we
feel
that
under
the
circumstances,
the
matter
is
right
for
adjudication
and
nothing
is
left
to
be
decided,
and
we
urge
the
court
to
take
jurisdiction
and
reverse.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
alfred
swedlaw.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
thank
you,
sir,
we
are
both
of
birmingham.
mr.
perrine,
my
colleague
and
i,
are
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
appellant,
mr.
james
e.mills.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
this
case
concerns
section
285
of
the
alabama
corrupt
practices
act,
regulating
election
practices.
and
specifically,
that
portion
of
the
act
which
provides
as
follows.
it
is
a
corrupt
practice
for
any
person
on
election
day
to
do
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes
for
or
against
the
election
or
nomination
of
any
candidate,
or
in
support
of
or
in
opposition
to
any
proposition
that
is
being
voted
on,
on
the
day
on
which
the
election
affecting
such
candidates
or
propositions
is
being
held.
mr.
mills
is
editor
of
the
birmingham
post-herald,
a
morning
newspaper
published
daily
in
birmingham,
alabama,
and
distributed
throughout
the
state
of
alabama.
the
circulation
of
this
paper
is
approximately
85,000
as
being
the
second
largest
newspaper
in
the
state.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes,
sir.
there's
an
afternoon
paper,
the
sister
paper
of
the
birmingham
post,
it's
the
birmingham
news
and
it
has
a
circulation
of
approximately
130,000,
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
this
is
the
only
morning
newspaper.
on
november
6
of
1962,
a
municipal
election
was
held
in
birmingham
to
determine
whether
the
existing
commission
form
of
city
government
would
be
retained
or
would
be
replaced
by
the
so-called
mayor-council
form.
mr.
mills
authored
an
editorial
which
was
published
on
election
day
in
his
newspaper.
the
editorial
appears
in
full
on
page
25
of
the
record
and
as
appendix
k
on
page
35
of
the
appellant's
brief.
in
this
editorial,
mr.
mills
criticized
the
then
mayor
of
birmingham
for
promising
pay
raises
to
city
employees
and
for
saying
that
he
would
instruct
city
employees
to
neither
give
out
news
to
nor
discuss
with
reporters
of
the
birmingham
post-herald,
or
its
sister
paper,
the
birmingham
news,
any
public
business.
the
mills
editorial
stated
that
the
proposed
pay
raises
were
--
was
another
good
reason
why
the
voter
should
vote
overwhelmingly
today
in
favor
of
mayor-council
government.
as
to
the
news
blackout
threatened
by
the
mayor,
the
editorial
comment
was,
if
mayor
hanes
displays
such
arrogant
disregard
of
the
public
right
to
know
on
the
eve
of
election,
what
can
we
expect
in
the
future
if
the
city
commission
should
be
retained.
birmingham
and
the
people
of
birmingham
deserve
a
better
break.
a
vote
for
mayor-council
government
will
give
it
to
them.
the
publication
of
this
editorial
marked
the
beginning
of
the
chain
of
events
ultimately
leading
to
our
appearance
here
this
morning.
a
criminal
complaint
was
filed
against
mr.
mills
on
november
the
13th,
1962
issued
from
the
jefferson
county
criminal
court
charging
mills,
head
by
the
editorial
in
question.
electioneered
or
solicited
votes
on
election
day
in
contravention
of
section
285
of
the
alabama
corrupt
practices
act.
if
guilty
of
this
misdemeanor
as
charged,
mr.
mills
is
subject
to
a
fine
of
not
more
than
$500
and
he
may
also
be
imprisoned
in
the
county
jail
or
sentenced
at
hard
labor
for
six
months,
but
not
more
than
six
months
on
behalf
of
the
county.
demurrers
to
the
complaint
were
filed
on
mills'
behalf,
testing
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
the
editorial
on
both
the
alabama
and
the
federal
constitutions.
the
lower
court
--
the
criminal
court
sustained
these
demurrers
thereby,
in
effect,
declaring
the
statute
as
applied
unconstitutional.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir,
that's
all.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
on
election
day,
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
statute
having
been
declared
unconstitutional,
as
provided
by
alabama
procedure,
the
state
appealed
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
that
section
285
clearly
applied
to
the
mills
editorial
and
that
the
statute
as
applied
was
constitutional
under
the
police
powers
for
the
state
of
alabama.
the
order
of
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
trial
court.
we
filed
a
timely
application
on
behalf
of
mr.
mills
and
this
was
overruled
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mills
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
this
court
by
its
order
of
december
the
6th,
1965,
postponed
jurisdiction
for
further
consideration
to
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
its
merits.
under
those
circumstances,
we
will
address
ourselves
first
to
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case
arises
because
on
its
phase,
the
judgment
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
does
not
necessarily
conclude
the
litigation
between
the
state
of
alabama
and
mr.
mills.
alabama
procedure
would
permit
mills
on
an
actual
trial
of
the
case
below
to
interpose
defenses
other
than
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
in
question.
in
reality,
however,
mills
has
no
other
defense
either
in
fact
or
in
law
to
the
charge
against
him.
he
freely
concedes
that
he
wrote
the
editorial
complained
of
and
caused
it
to
be
published
on
election
day.
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
this
constituted
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
statute
as
thus
applied
is
constitutional.
therefore,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
federal
question,
that
is
the
constitutionality
or
not
of
the
alabama
statute
is
the
only
question
remaining
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
decided.
under
these
circumstances,
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
constituted
a
final
judgment
for
the
purposes
of
title
28
u.s.c.
section
1257.
in
the
case
of
pope
versus
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
company
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1953,
a
railroad
employee
invoking
the
federal
employers
liability
act
sued
his
employee
--
employer
for
injury
sustained
in
the
course
of
employment.
the
injuries
occurred
in
georgia
but
the
employee
sued
in
the
alabama
courts
and
the
railroad
filed
a
proceeding
to
restrain
the
alabama
action.
the
trial
court
sustained
the
general
demurrer
which
raised
the
provisions
of
the
federal
statute
as
a
bar
for
the
power
of
the
georgia
court
to
issue
the
injunction.
the
georgia
supreme
court
reversed
the
trial
court's
order
and
the
employee
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
as
an
out
case,
the
jurisdictional
question
in
pope
was
whether
or
not
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
was
final.
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
a
final
judgment
because
the
issue
was
right
for
adjudication.
there
is
hill.
the
petitioner
conceded
that
he
had
no
other
defense
in
opposed
and
that
his
case
rested
upon
his
claim
under
the
federal
statute
and
nothing
else.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
alabama
supreme
court,
judge
fortas,
has
so
construed
it
and
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
your
honor,
we
disputed
it
initially
in
the
court
below
but
the
application
of
the
statute
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
a
binding
construction
of
it
and
binding
on
this
court,
may
i
suggest,
to
the
same
effect
as
though
it
were
written
into
the
statute.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
this
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
didn't
quite
understand
you,
justice
harlan.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
oh
yes
sir,
we
can
then
oppose
that,
but
this
is
not
the
fact
where
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
defendant
authored
the
editorial.
mr.
mills,
the
defendant,
the
appellant
in
this
case
authored
the
editorial
and
caused
it
to
be
published.
so
in
truth,
we
have
no
further
defense.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
justice
white
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
we
have
not
been
convicted.
there
has
been
no
trial.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
oh
yes
sir,
we
would
plea
--
we
would
have
no
alternative,
there's
no
defense.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
well,
we
wouldn't
have
a
jury
trial
and
the
initial
procedure
would
be
without
a
jury
in
the
jefferson
county
criminal
court
if
we
lost
there
in
order
to
work
our
way
back
up
to
where
we
are
today,
we
would
go
to
the
--
to
the
circuit
court
and
there
we
could
demand
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir,
there
would
be
a
de
novo
procedure
and
losing
there,
we
would
then
be
permitted
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
losing
there
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
and
losing
there
to
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
suppose
that
they
--
that
they
could
your
honor.
it
would
be
set
aside
in
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
they
judge
the
facts
only
and
jury
tries
the
facts.
there
is
no
way
from
a
practical
standpoint,
justice
white.
there's
nothing
that
we
can
do
that
we
are
not
now
doing.
and
this
is
--
this
is
our
plea
as
to
the
finality
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama's
judgment.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir,
i
suppose
that
the
jury
could
acquit.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no
sir,
the
pope
case,
justice
white,
went
on
the
--
went
on
the
theory
that
the
judgment
was
final
even
though
it
was
a
demurrer
and
that
the
case
was
right
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
for
adjudication.
now
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
think
not,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
case
it
followed
in
1963,
the
curry
case
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
went
off
on
the
question,
initially,
the
main
rationale
of
the
decision
was
the
power
of
the
georgia
court
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
to
act.
but
it's
an
alternative
--
it's
an
alternate
basis
of
decision
in
the
curry
case,
the
court
cited
pope
and
relied
on
pope
which
was
apart
completely
from
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
to
act,
power
as
i
understand
it.
the
pope
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
oh,
yes
sir
and
the
alternate
basis
of
opinion
in
curry.
and
i
think
in
richfield
which
preceded
the
pope
case.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
we
think
--
we
think
this
is
very
true
and
a
very
cogent
reason.
the
dombrowski
case
of
course
involved
the
question
of
--
the
doctrine
of
abstention.
but
the
analogy
is
certainly
clear.
we
feel
that
mr.
mills
should
not
be
subjected
to
a
criminal
prosecution
and
conviction
in
order
to
obtain
a
declaration
of
his
constitutional
rights.
this
matter
has
--
it
began
in
1962
of
november,
some
two
and
a
half
years
have
already
elapsed
since
that
time
and
we
are
now
after
that
long
delay
here
in
the
supreme
court.
if
we
are
compelled
to
go
back
to
the
alabama
courts
and
went
our
way
through
the
torturous
appellate
procedure
to
get
back
here,
it
would
be
anticipated
that
another
two
or
two
and
a
half
years
would
expire.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
we
have
a
firm
determination
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
this
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
alabama's
police
power.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
exactly,
justice
black.
we
feel
that
not
only
--
not
only
would
this
be
an
intolerable
situation
insofar
as
the
appellant
is
concerned
but
there
are
other
rights
besides
those
of
mr.
mills
here
involved
as
in
the
dombrowski
case.
the
question
of
the
effect
that
the
supreme
court's
decision
has
had
on
first
amendment
rights
in
alabama
must
be
considered.
the
broad
sweep
of
the
alabama
corrupt
practices
act
to
encompass
an
editorial
has
necessarily
in
the
words
of
dombrowski
had
a
“chilling
effect”,
if
you
please,
on
the
alabama
press
generally.
the
blanket
of
silence
which
has
descended
upon
the
press
of
alabama
each
election
day
since
the
arrest
of
mr.
mills
continues
to
insulate
the
people
of
alabama
from
editorial
comment
and
press
information
to
which
we
feel
they
are
entitled
and
that
they're
entitled
to
this
without
restraint.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no
sir
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no,
justice
fortas.
we
think
that
the
first
amendment
applies
equally
to
any
form
of
expression
be
a
newspaper
or
a
chamber
of
commerce
publication,
or
the
handing
out
of
pamphlets.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
or
a
speech
why
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes,
and
we
see
no
distinction
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
and
with
reference
to
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
whatever
form
the
electioneering
may
take.
we
see
no
legitimate
legislative
purpose
in
this
sought
of
restraint.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
man
being
prosecuted
for
standing
within
20
or
30
feet
of
an
election
booth
and
blocking
or
harassing
people
coming
to
vote.
this
is
not
a
regulation
of
conduct.
this
is
a
regulation
of
speech.
and
we
see
no
legitimate
interest
for
the
state
of
alabama
in
such
restraint.
in
fact,
we
--
it's
our
contention
that
the
public
interest
lies
completely
in
the
other
direction.
not
in
the
direction
of
curtailing
expression
but
in
the
direction
of
giving
full
vent
to
public
expression
concerning
matters
of
general
interest
and
public
interest
elections
particularly.
now,
as
far
as
the
construction
of
the
statute
being
binding
on
this
court
irrespective
of
the
--
when
it's
emanated
--
the
expression
emanated,
it
is
binding
on
this
court,
the
alabama
supreme
court's
application
of
it.
this
was
decided
in
herndon
versus
lowry,
in
the
terminiello
case
just
to
the
same
effect
as
though
--
the
statute
had
said
that
no
editorial
shall
be
written
or
published
on
election
day.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
may
i
--
we're
getting
into
the
merits
of
our
case
which
is
perfectly
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
satisfactory,
and
i
should
--
i
would
be
happy
to
pursue
this
argument
further.
no
sir,
the
two
rather
blur
together
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
the
merits
of
our
case
are
rather
intermingle,
but
you're
absolutely
correct.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
well
the
only
justification,
justice
black
was
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
gave
for
this
statute
is
a
--
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
directly,
a
salutary
enactment
designed
to
prevent
last
minute
charges
and
countercharges.
now
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
futility
of
this
reasoning
is
apparent,
may
it
please
the
court.
you
don't
prevent
last
minute
charges
and
countercharges,
be
the
deadline
election
day
or
30
days,
or
60
days
or
90
days
before
election
day.
someone
always
has
the
last
word
before
time
runs
out.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no
sir,
we
concede
readily
that
the
alabama
corrupt
practices
act
does
have
a
valid
sphere
of
operation.
we
certainly
think
that
the
restriction
as
to
place
would
be
appropriate,
prevent
the
actual
harassment
of
a
voter.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
possibly
because,
your
honor,
that
there
are
certain
interest
that
the
state
has
in
--
and
oddly
that
is
a
--
an
election
is
not
disturbed
by
breach
of
peace
by
the
state.
by
a
criminal
offense,
we
don't
argue
that
the
--
that
the
right
of
free
speech
or
free
press
is
an
(voice
overlap)
absolutely
right.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
possibly,
this
would
be
the
equivalent.
this
would
be
the
equivalent,
be
convicted
--
conviction
on
misdemeanor.
we
argue
for
a
complete
and
absolute
right
to
question.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
we
think
that
that
would
--
that
would
lend
the
validity.
we
tend
to
make
this
that
extensive.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
oh,
possibly
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
see.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
because
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
because
when
you're
--
may
it
please,
your
honor,
it
involves
something
physical.
it
involves
conduct.
it's
not
a
limitation
on
the
expression.
an
analogy
for
example
was
in
the
schneider
case,
i
think
it
was,
various
statutes
prohibiting
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
but
not
restraining,
not
a
physical
--
not
a
physical
blocking
of
a
polling
place.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
would
argue
most
vehemently
with
you
but
this
should
not
be
tolerated,
that
this
would
be
an
unwarranted
restriction.
i
would
--
this
would
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
with
100
feet,
i
don't
think
there's
any
magic
of
100
feet.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i'm
incomplete
in
terms,
your
honor.(voice
overlap)
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
but
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far
here.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
would
take
that
position.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
go
nearly
that
far
in
this
case,
however,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
unless
there
is
a
breach
of
the
peace
--
unless
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
use
the
classic
test,
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
--
to
the
public
interest,
i
feel
that
there
should
be
no
limitation
or
restriction
on
freedom
of
expression
be
at
newspaper
or
otherwise.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
if
the
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
if
they're
not
blocking
traffic,
creating
hazards
to
the
public
peace,
creating
traffic
conditions
that
might
result
in
danger
to
the
public
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
no
sir,
you
do
not.
there
is
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
there
is
no
such
a
question
involved
in
our
case,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
there
are
numerous
statutes
--
corrupt
practices
act
are
numerous.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
it
says
you
shall
not
publish
a
newspaper
editorial?
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
i
do
not
know
how
general
that
specific
provision
is,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
there
are
acts
of
this
nature
but
their
exact
content
--
there
has
been
no
construction.
we
know
this
but
we
have
found
no
cases
bearing
on
that
point.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
that
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir,
this
is
true.
we
feel
that
--
as
i've
said
in
the
schneider
case
trying
to
regulate
the
distribution
of
pamphlets
on
public
streets
under
the
guise
of
this
being
a
regulation
that
would
keep
the
street
from
being
littered.
and
this
statute
was
struck
down
under
the
guise
of
regulating
conduct,
those
statutes
regulated
free
expression.
now,
that's
exactly
what
is
happening
in
the
alabama
statute.
it
would
be
only
of
small
step
from
the
alabama
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
mills
case
to
say
--
well,
for
a
benevolent
legislature
to
say
well
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
we
think,
in
this
--
in
times
of
trouble
and
stress
such
as
we
are
now
enduring,
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
that
there'd
be
some
surcease,
some
respite
from
all
of
these
tension,
all
of
the
bad
news.
and
therefore,
let's
say
that
only
on
monday,
wednesday,
and
friday,
we'll
have
no
editorial
appear
in
newspapers,
we'll
have
no
television,
news
broadcast
of
any
sort
because
the
people
are
entitled
to
this
sort
of
euphoric
atmosphere
in
which
their
tranquility
is
undisturbed.
this
is
the
danger
of
the
mills
case
that's
decided
by
supreme
court
of
alabama.
this
is
speech
control.
if
you
will,
this
is
thought
control.
if
i
may
just
take
a
moment
and
quote
from
the
mills'
opinion
to
give
the
court
an
idea
of
what
was
here
involved.
this
court,
this
is
the
alabama
supreme
court.
this
court
holds
in
accordance
with
the
great
weight
of
authority
that
a
law
cannot
be
held
to
be
invalid
because
unreasonable
unless
and
until
it
appears
beyond
reasonable
controversy
that
it
necessarily
impairs
to
the
point
of
practical
destruction,
a
right
safeguarded
by
the
constitution.
as
it
already
has
been
pointed
out,
the
law
under
consideration
lies
within
the
police
power
field
and
impairs,
and
please
listen
--
and
impairs
only
the
right
of
free
expression.
now,
by
whatever
theory
or
by
whatever
rationale
this
decision
is
tested,
we
think
that
the
alabama
statute
as
applied
to
mr.
mills
was
faux.
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
this
is
fundamentally
objectionable,
is
that
--
is
the
assumption
by
the
court
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
provide
the
voters
of
alabama
an
intellectually,
antiseptic
atmosphere
on
election
day.
this
is
not
true.
this
is
a
monstrous
assumption,
if
you
will,
in
a
free
society.
this
is
the
danger
of
the
mills
case.
the
gradual,
by
slow
degrees,
encroachment
on
first
amendment
rights
by
the
states
or
by
the
congress,
it
should
not
be
tolerated
except
in
very
clear
cases.
and
then
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
roth
case,
the
door
should
be
left
ajar
only
for
the
purpose
of
restricting
what
have
to
be
restricted
in
the
public
interest,
and
then
the
door
should
be
tightly
closed
because
the
matter
of
free
expression
is
not
just
free
expression,
it
is
the
essence
as
this
court
has
recognized,
it
is
the
essence
of
self-government.
and
we
ask
that
the
court
take
jurisdiction
and
then
it
reversed
the
alabama
supreme
court,
my
colleague,
mr.
perrine
will
argue
the
vagueness
objection
to
the
statute.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
rebuttal,
mr.
hawkins
has
stated
that
in
his
judgment,
various
acts
which
the
statute
by
its
terms
proscribed
would
not
be
so
construed
and
would
not
be
--
this
is
not
the
intendment
of
the
statute.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear
in
these
various
respects
and
this,
this
is
one
of
the
faults,
the
vagueness
fault
in
the
statute
that
it
brings
within
its
ambit
and
within
its
purview
otherwise
harmless
conduct
and
proscribes
it
and
makes
it
a
criminal
offense.
the
statute
does
not
require
that
it'd
be
done
with
a
criminal
intent.
the
statute
says
thus
and
so
shall
be
forbidden
on
election
day.
now,
one
of
the
concerns
of
the
state
apparently
and
mr.
hawkins
has
expressed
here
and
i
think
that
this
paternalistic
attitude
is
permeated
in
the
state's
position
throughout
these
proceedings.
questionably,
the
right
of
the
public
to
be
protected,
mr.
hawkins
said
that
he
thought
that
one
of
the
purposes
would
be
to
prevent
a
voter
from
forming
a
role
and
opinion.
now,
this
is
precisely
--
this
is
precisely
the
thought
--
that
sort
of
thing
that
we
are
urging
on
the
court
here
to
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
legislative
interest
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
protect,
thornhill
decided
that.
thornhill
decided
that
--
the
fact
that
people
might
be
persuaded
to
take
the
position
contrary
to
their
best
interest
or
to
adopt
an
indirect
opinion
are
not
dangers
which
government
has
any
right
to
prevent.
the
antiseptic
atmosphere
of
an
election
is
not
something
that
is
a
matter
of
legislative
interest
--
legitimate
legislative
interest.
there's
nothing
it
says
we
need
to
have
peaceful,
and
calm,
and
tranquil
atmospheres
on
election
day.
we
must
defend
out
--
like
to
speak
out
robustly
as
the
state
has
said,
even
to
the
point
--
as
this
court
has
said,
even
to
the
point
of
criminal
libel
unless
done
with
malice
as
this
court
held
in
the
garrison
case
with
regard
to
public
officials.
if
the
court
will
permit
with
the
remaining
time
we
have
at
hand,
we
should
like
to
revert
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
notwithstanding
that
the
state
is
in
effect
graciously
conceded
that
it
makes
no
issue
of
the
jurisdictional
question.
but
since
a
state
in
its
brief
has
made
certain
comments
and
distinctions,
for
example
the
state
has
made
much
of
the
--
of
an
alleged
distinction
on
the
finality
question
between
the
pope
case,
for
example,
in
our
case
and
that
this
case
is
a
criminal
procedure
whereas
in
pope,
criminality
was
not
involved.
we
submit
that
if
there
is
any
such
distinction,
it
lies
in
favor
of
the
appellant
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
it's
of
much
more
pertinence,
much
more
concerned
that
this
man,
that
mr.
mills
not
be
subjected
to
a
criminal
trial
and
risk
having
a
conviction
against
his
record
in
order
to
test
his
constitutional
rights.
the
distinction
is
not
made
in
the
statute.
section
1257
requires
no
distinction
such
as
the
state
would
urge
between
criminal
and
civil
proceedings.
now,
the
state
also
relies
on
the
polakow
case
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari,
not
decided,
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
denied.
and
in
polakow,
there
was
involved
the
procedure
of
indictment
against
certain
persons
in
alabama
for
selling
real
estate
without
a
license
as
prescribed
by
the
statute.
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
was
likewise
tested
by
demurrer
and
the
matter
went
to
the
supreme
court
on
certiorari
but
the
supreme
court
denied
the
writ.
now,
the
distinction
between
the
polakow
case
and
the
case
involved
is
a
fraud
that
appears
in
polakow.
the
defendant
there
had
other
defenses
to
interpose
in
a
trial
of
the
case.
that
is
not
true
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
case
involved.
moreover,
the
court
has
moved
away
from
polakow
to
the
point
that
it
maybe
said
that
polakow
has
by
being
ignored
been
overruled.
the
pope
case,
the
richfield
case,
the
curry
case
have
all
departed
at
least
implicitly
from
the
polakow
holding.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
threat
of
sanctions,
the
threat
of
first
amendment
restrictions,
can
even
more
or
can
almost
as
much
as
the
imposition
of
the
sanctions
themselves
infringe
upon
constitutional
rights.
as
late
as
last
month
in
the
fanny
hill
case,
for
example,
this
court
in
passing
on
the
--
on
its
jurisdiction
in
the
--
on
the
massachusetts
proceedings,
in
which
there
had
been
an
in
rem
declaration
of
obscenity
against
the
fanny
hill
book
but
there
had
been
no
prosecution,
there'd
been
no
criminal
trial,
been
no
criminal
conviction
albeit.
but
this
court
noted
that
the
declaration
of
obscenity
is
likely
to
have
a
serious
inhibitory
effect
on
the
distribution
of
the
book.
and
that
this
probable
effect
is
in
no
small
measure
derived
from
the
possible
collateral
uses
of
the
declaration
in
subsequent
prosecution
under
the
massachusetts
statute.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
polakow,
p-o-l-a-k-o-w
is
the
--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
--
case,
yes
sir,
it's
cited
in
the
state's
brief
and
we
had
--
we
have
the
citation,
i
think
it's
319
u.s.--
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
it's
319
u.s.
1155.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
319
u.s.
1155,
i
think.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
750
to
755.
mr.
alfred
swedlaw
the
parallel
between
the
fanny
hill
case
and
the
mills
case
we
think
is
evident.
mr.
mills'
editorial
like
fanny
hill
stands
condemned
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
as
being
in
violation
of
state
law
and
thus
irrespective
of
what
may
or
may
not
happen
in
future
proceedings
below.
the
freedom
of
expression
is
now
seriously
impaired
just
as
this
court
felt
that
it
would
be
in
massachusetts
although
no
criminal
prosecutions
had
actually
occurred.
and
it
might
be
said
in
conclusion.
it
might
be
said
within
the
pope
case
for
example
for
all
that
appears
of
the
railroad
company
might
have
waived
its
injunction
proceedings
which
was
sanctioned.
and
these
are
possibilities,
but
the
practical
effect
of
this
situation,
as
we
have
said,
is
that
mr.
mills
has
been
tried
on
the
merits
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
and
we
feel
that
under
the
circumstances,
the
matter
is
right
for
adjudication
and
nothing
is
left
to
be
decided,
and
we
urge
the
court
to
take
jurisdiction
and
reverse.
thank
you.
