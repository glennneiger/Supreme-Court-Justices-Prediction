mr.
burgin
hawkins
--
prior
to
that
time,
many
acts
of
corrupt
practice
at
the
polls,
intimidation
of
voters
getting
them
drunk,
buying
votes,
there
are
many
types
of
corruption.
of
course,
those
--
all
those
laws
were
passed
to
give
the
elector
a
right
to
go
to
the
polls
unmolested,
undisturbed,
and
vote
his
choice.
now,
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
this
statute
prohibiting
all
electioneering
and
solicitation
on
an
election
day
transcends
the
right
of
a
legislature
to
put
certain
reasonable
restraints
on
the

the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united

so
we
get
right
down
to
the
mead
of
it,
to
ask
ourselves,
is
it
a
reasonable
regulation?
and
i
think
the
second
question
then
is,
what
do
you
mean
by
electioneering?
what
do
you
mean
by
solicitation?
how
broad?
does
it
give
or
does
it
take
the
breath
away
from
a
first
amendment
or
can
the
first
amendment
still
breathe
easy
with
that
statute
on
the
books?
i
think
every
statute
has
to
be
governed
by
what
the
intent
and
what
evil
was
sought
to
be
cured.
the
evil
sought
to
be
cured
here
was
to
prevent
corruption
at
an
election.
congress
has
just
recently
given
to
literate
thousands
in
our
state
a
franchise
to
exercise
their
right
to
vote.
and
many
of
them,
illiterates,
will
have
many
difficulties
confronting
them
when
they
reach
the
polls.
and
i
think
that
this
court
should
give
serious
consideration
to
any
acts
of
a
legislature
that
will
carry
out
the
purposes
and
intent
and
a
motive
behind
that
act.
now,
theirs
is
no
reason
--
or
no
place
here
for
idle
talk
about
a
man
at
a
breakfast
table
asking
his
wife
won't
she
vote
for
a
certain
candidate?
to
me
that's
in
a
--
on
a
golf
course,
in
a
tennis
match,
that's
idle
conversation.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
something
that
is
done,
enacted
as
done
with
the
intent
to
swear
on
election
or
to
decide
on
election.
i
even
put
up
your
billboards,
talk
about
your
billboards,
they're
ought
to
be
taken
down,
maybe
in
some
sense
that
is
electioneering.
maybe
in
some
sense
that
billboard
does
solicit
your
vote.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
but
i
am
sure
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
urging
people
to
vote?
i
think
if
you
urge
the
person
to
vote,
it
would
be
absolutely
alright.
it's
urging
them
to
vote
for
particular
candidate
or
issue.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
don't
think
it
was
that
--
i
don't
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
justice
white,
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
original
intent
of
this
legislature
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
--
but
to
prohibit
people
from
getting
numbers
of
people
out
to
the
polls.
in
our
county
and
in
our
state,
the
city
organizations
put
plaques
across
the
streets,
“go
to
the
poll,
this
is
election
day.
exercise
your
constitutional
right”.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
electioneering
as
it
was
meant
when
it
was
adopted
in
1915
in
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
statute
intended
to
prohibit.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
taking
those
very
people
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
if
that
was
a
case
before
your
honor,
i
would
confess,
i
wouldn't
argue
such
a
ridiculous
thing
that
a
man
cannot
get
him
a
taxicab
and
go
to
the
polls
to
vote
although
i
think
it's
just
ridiculous
to
argue
that.
and
to
that,
i
don't
think
that
that's
--
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
statute
means.
now,
i
think
that
if
you
furnish
for
the
purpose
and
motive
of
getting
those
people
that
you
picked
up
and
carry
to
the
polls
to
vote
your
particular
sentiments
or
to
vote
your
particular
issue
or
to
vote
for
your
particular
candidate
i
think
is
electioneering.
not
just
to
furnish
somebody
or
transportation
to
the
polls,
you
might
be
on
your
way
to
the
polls
and
pick
up
a
passerby
and
carry
him
to
the
polls.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
it's
a
question
you
get
down
to
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
solicitation
and
electioneering.
how
broad
in
scope
is
it?
is
it
--
does
it
have
such
a
meaning
that
a
man
of
common
intellect
and
common
knowledge
understands
this
meaning
or
is
it
a
meaning
that
that
is
not
understood.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
it
certainly
could
be.
it
could
be
broader
than
the
word
or
confine
the
word
solicitation
(voice
overlap)
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
it
says
to
for
any
candidate
or
any
issue
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
it
could
be
so.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
it
could
be
so
interpreted
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
what?
mr.
burgin
hawkins
no
sir.
now,
if
the
statute
has
a
field
of
operation
and
it's
not
too
broad,
i
think
it
plays
the
most
important
part
in
having
an
orderly
election.
you
say
that
the
statutes,
i
think
the
courts
have
so
held
that
the
prohibiting
of
a
solicitation
of
a
vote
within
a
certain
distance
from
the
poll
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
that
more
damage
could
be
done
in
a
printed
word
through
a
mass
media,
and
then
would
be
by
having
a
statute
that's
limited
to
the
prohibiting
and
solicitation
of
votes
within
100
feet
of
the
poll.
i
think
that
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
statutes
has
to
be
looked
at
with
common
sense.
all
lies
go
hand
in
hand
with
common
sense.
and
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
intended
that
a
person
would
be
prosecuted
if
that
abridged
party,
one
lady
said
to
another
one,
“i
wish
you'd
vote
for
a
certain
candidate
or
vote
on
a
certain
issue.”
its
sole
purpose
is
to
have
orderliness,
peace
and
quiet.
let
the
editor
of
that
paper
for
364
days
out
of
the
year,
expound
any
cause
he
desires.
we're
not
arguing
that
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
advocate
any
issue
or
to
support
any
candidate.
but
we
do
think
that
the
statute
is
not
asking
too
much
to
say
that
on
one
day,
out
of
the
year,
don't
publish
an
editorial
soliciting
votes
for
a
particular
candidate
or
on
a
particular
issue.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
defend
that
man's
right
on
election
day
to
defend
his
character
and
his
good
name
and
i
think
the
first
amendment
gives
him
that
right
even
in
the
face
of
what
the
statute
may
say.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
think
that
it
would
but
i
have
given
a
lot
of
thought
to
that.
i'll
say
this
that
i
certainly
think
that
a
newspaper
can
write
a
news
item
and
state
the
facts,
if
it
is
a
fact.
now
i'm
--
we're
not
arguing
(voice
overlap)
the
fact
of
newspaper
or
publishing
news
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burgin
hawkins
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
so
many
things
brought
there.
how
do
you
know
the
man
made
an
admission
on
the
certain
conditions?
how
do
you
know
that
the
report
is
--
that
the
opposition
got
a
correct
reporter.
but
if
it
were
a
fact
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
don't
know.
i
confess
to
you
that
i
don't
know
on
that
question
what
my
opinion
would
be.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
it's
such
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
yes,
it
brings
up
a
serious
question.
i
think
that
people
have
the
right
to
know
of
course
whether
the
candidate
is
corrupt,
whether
he's
violated
the
laws
that
would
necessarily
disqualify
him
for
office,
yet
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
know
rather
it
should
be
done
on
a
particular
election
day
or
not,
because
if
you
say
well,
that
can
be
done
then
why
can't
this
be
done
and
if
this
can
be
done,
why
can't
that
be
done.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
end
of
that
would
be.
if
you
take
all
of
the
decisions
of
the
first
amendment
and
state
all
of
them,
i
think
you
get
back
about
where
you
started
for
in
the
first
place.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
justice
douglas
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
comment
when
in
fact
that
one
person
is
going
to
vote
against
somebody,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
(voice
overlap)
all
others
while
they're
there.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
think
that
probably
that
would
be
a
fair
comment
that
he's
going
to
vote
against
him.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
justice
white,
i
think
if
you
recall
in
the
days
of
the
old
west
in
other
sections
of
our
country
where
elections
were
bought.
people
go
into
the
polls
were
intimidated.
they
were
frightened.
they
were
fearful
to
even
go
there
to
exercise
their
right
to
vote.
and
i
think
it
was
to
give
a
feeling
of
security
and
to
prevent
some
undue
influence
on
election
day.
if
i
would
tend
that
voter,
he
maybe
even
vote
contrary
to
his
own
best
interest,
i
don't
see
why
if
a
newspaper
or
any
other
person
or
association
or
anybody
else
has
every
day
in
a
year
to
express
their
opinion,
why
is
such
imposition
on
any
individual
to
say,
well
now
this
day
is
going
to
be
set
aside
for
an
election
day,
let's
all
keep
quiet
and
let
the
newspaper
keep
its
mouth
shut
and
let
everybody
else
keep
quiet
on
that
day.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well
i
think
that
--
i
think
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well
i
think
it
causes
--
like
that
it
cause
disorder,
riots,
violence,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burgin
hawkins
sir?
mr.
burgin
hawkins
the
editorial?
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
an
editorial
written
work
can
start
a
war
just
as
well
as
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
--
two
people
in
a
fight.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
that
is
to
prevent
disorder
at
the
polls.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
yes
sir.
and
i
think
that
you
can
create
a
disorder
at
the
polls
by
allowing
a
newspaper
to
create
certain
editorial
on
certain
subjects,
just
the
same
as
if
they
went
to
polls,
holding
someone
and
trying
to
convince
them
in.
so
i
think
that's
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
sir?
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
of
course
sir.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
oh
yes,
he'd
be
back
up
then.
now,
there
are
some
questions
here
about
--
on
jurisdiction.
i
think
your
honor
that
this
court
should
render
an
authoritative
decision
on
this
question.
it's
of
vital
importance
to
the
people
of
alabama.
and
if
we
went
back
through
the
courts,
i
can
tell
you
what
i
think
would
happen
in
the
face
of
the
supreme
court's
decision
although
there
is
a
trial
de
novo,
i
think
if
an
evidence
was,
as
presented
to
you
here,
the
court
would
give
a
request
in
favor
of
the
state
under
a
general
charge,
that
if
they
believe
that
they
would
have
to
convict
mr.
mills.
so
now
in
this
type
of
a
statute,
in
any
complaint
or
sworn
affidavit
or
indictment,
the
facts
alleging
a
solicitation
or
the
electioneering
would
necessarily
have
to
be
in
that
complaint
or
sworn
affidavit.
and
i
think
if
any
person,
prosecuting
attorney
or
anyone
else
attempted
to
use
the
statute
in
a
--
and
under
the
facts
that
wouldn't
constitute
solicitation
or
demurrer
filed
to
the
indictment,
a
demurrer
filed
to
the
complaint
raising
a
question
that
it
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
law
under
the
state
of
alabama,
the
courts
would
have
a
review
of
the
conduct
of
the
individual
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
court
in
its
opinion
thought
that
this
alleged,
where
it
might
be
who
was
accused
of
violating
it,
did
electioneer
or
solicit
votes
for
an
individual
or
candidate
on
election
day.
i
thank
you.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
in
criminal
libel,
justice
black,
i've
never
had
a
criminal
libel
case
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
just
don't
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
do
think
of
one
thing
that
these
statutes
being
penal
in
nature
are
certainly
be
strictly
construed.
and
with
that,
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
for
speaking
to
you.
thank
you.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
--
prior

i
think

taking
those
very
people
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
if
that
was
a
case
before
your
honor,
i
would
confess,
i
wouldn't
argue
such
a
ridiculous
thing
that
a
man
cannot
get
him
a
taxicab
and
go
to
the
polls
to
vote
although
i
think
it's
just
ridiculous
to
argue
that.
and
to
that,
i
don't
think
that
that's
--
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
statute
means.
now,
i
think
that
if
you
furnish
for
the
purpose
and
motive
of
getting
those
people
that
you
picked
up
and
carry
to
the
polls
to
vote
your
particular
sentiments
or
to
vote
your
particular
issue
or
to
vote
for
your
particular
candidate
i
think
is
electioneering.
not
just
to
furnish
somebody
or
transportation
to
the
polls,
you
might
be
on
your
way
to
the
polls
and
pick
up
a
passerby
and
carry
him
to
the
polls.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
it's
a
question
you
get
down
to
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
solicitation
and
electioneering.
how
broad
in
scope
is
it?
is
it
--
does
it
have
such
a
meaning
that
a
man
of
common
intellect
and
common
knowledge
understands
this
meaning
or
is
it
a
meaning
that
that
is
not
understood.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
it
certainly
could
be.
it
could
be
broader
than
the
word
or
confine
the
word
solicitation
(voice
overlap)
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
it
says
to
for
any
candidate
or
any
issue
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
it
could
be
so.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
it
could
be
so
interpreted
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
what?
mr.
burgin
hawkins
no
sir.
now,
if
the
statute
has
a
field
of
operation
and
it's
not
too
broad,
i
think
it
plays
the
most
important
part
in
having
an
orderly
election.
you
say
that
the
statutes,
i
think
the
courts
have
so
held
that
the
prohibiting
of
a
solicitation
of
a
vote
within
a
certain
distance
from
the
poll
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
that
more
damage
could
be
done
in
a
printed
word
through
a
mass
media,
and
then
would
be
by
having
a
statute
that's
limited
to
the
prohibiting
and
solicitation
of
votes
within
100
feet
of
the
poll.
i
think
that
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
statutes
has
to
be
looked
at
with
common
sense.
all
lies
go
hand
in
hand
with
common
sense.
and
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
intended
that
a
person
would
be
prosecuted
if
that
abridged
party,
one
lady
said
to
another
one,
“i
wish
you'd
vote
for
a
certain
candidate
or
vote
on
a
certain
issue.”
its
sole
purpose
is
to
have
orderliness,
peace
and
quiet.
let
the
editor
of
that
paper
for
364
days
out
of
the
year,
expound
any
cause
he
desires.
we're
not
arguing
that
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
advocate
any
issue
or
to
support
any
candidate.
but
we
do
think
that
the
statute
is
not
asking
too
much
to
say
that
on
one
day,
out
of
the
year,
don't
publish
an
editorial
soliciting
votes
for
a
particular
candidate
or
on
a
particular
issue.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
defend
that
man's
right
on
election
day
to
defend
his
character
and
his
good
name
and
i
think
the
first
amendment
gives
him
that
right
even
in
the
face
of
what
the
statute
may
say.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
think
that
it
would
but
i
have
given
a
lot
of
thought
to
that.
i'll
say
this
that
i
certainly
think
that
a
newspaper
can
write
a
news
item
and
state
the
facts,
if
it
is
a
fact.
now
i'm
--
we're
not
arguing
(voice
overlap)
the
fact
of
newspaper
or
publishing
news
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burgin
hawkins
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
so
many
things
brought
there.
how
do
you
know
the
man
made
an
admission
on
the
certain
conditions?
how
do
you
know
that
the
report
is
--
that
the
opposition
got
a
correct
reporter.
but
if
it
were
a
fact
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
don't
know.
i
confess
to
you
that
i
don't
know
on
that
question
what
my
opinion
would
be.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
it's
such
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
yes,
it
brings
up
a
serious
question.
i
think
that
people
have
the
right
to
know
of
course
whether
the
candidate
is
corrupt,
whether
he's
violated
the
laws
that
would
necessarily
disqualify
him
for
office,
yet
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
know
rather
it
should
be
done
on
a
particular
election
day
or
not,
because
if
you
say
well,
that
can
be
done
then
why
can't
this
be
done
and
if
this
can
be
done,
why
can't
that
be
done.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
end
of
that
would
be.
if
you
take
all
of
the
decisions
of
the
first
amendment
and
state
all
of
them,
i
think
you
get
back
about
where
you
started
for
in
the
first
place.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
justice
douglas
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
comment
when
in
fact
that
one
person
is
going
to
vote
against
somebody,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
(voice
overlap)
all
others
while
they're
there.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
think
that
probably
that
would
be
a
fair
comment
that
he's
going
to
vote
against
him.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
justice
white,
i
think
if
you
recall
in
the
days
of
the
old
west
in
other
sections
of
our
country
where
elections
were
bought.
people
go
into
the
polls
were
intimidated.
they
were
frightened.
they
were
fearful
to
even
go
there
to
exercise
their
right
to
vote.
and
i
think
it
was
to
give
a
feeling
of
security
and
to
prevent
some
undue
influence
on
election
day.
if
i
would
tend
that
voter,
he
maybe
even
vote
contrary
to
his
own
best
interest,
i
don't
see
why
if
a
newspaper
or
any
other
person
or
association
or
anybody
else
has
every
day
in
a
year
to
express
their
opinion,
why
is
such
imposition
on
any
individual
to
say,
well
now
this
day
is
going
to
be
set
aside
for
an
election
day,
let's
all
keep
quiet
and
let
the
newspaper
keep
its
mouth
shut
and
let
everybody
else
keep
quiet
on
that
day.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well
i
think
that
--
i
think
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well
i
think
it
causes
--
like
that
it
cause
disorder,
riots,
violence,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burgin
hawkins
sir?
mr.
burgin
hawkins
the
editorial?
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
an
editorial
written
work
can
start
a
war
just
as
well
as
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
--
two
people
in
a
fight.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
that
is
to
prevent
disorder
at
the
polls.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
yes
sir.
and
i
think
that
you
can
create
a
disorder
at
the
polls
by
allowing
a
newspaper
to
create
certain
editorial
on
certain
subjects,
just
the
same
as
if
they
went
to
polls,
holding
someone
and
trying
to
convince
them
in.
so
i
think
that's
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
sir?
mr.
burgin
hawkins
well,
of
course
sir.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
oh
yes,
he'd
be
back
up
then.
now,
there
are
some
questions
here
about
--
on
jurisdiction.
i
think
your
honor
that
this
court
should
render
an
authoritative
decision
on
this
question.
it's
of
vital
importance
to
the
people
of
alabama.
and
if
we
went
back
through
the
courts,
i
can
tell
you
what
i
think
would
happen
in
the
face
of
the
supreme
court's
decision
although
there
is
a
trial
de
novo,
i
think
if
an
evidence
was,
as
presented
to
you
here,
the
court
would
give
a
request
in
favor
of
the
state
under
a
general
charge,
that
if
they
believe
that
they
would
have
to
convict
mr.
mills.
so
now
in
this
type
of
a
statute,
in
any
complaint
or
sworn
affidavit
or
indictment,
the
facts
alleging
a
solicitation
or
the
electioneering
would
necessarily
have
to
be
in
that
complaint
or
sworn
affidavit.
and
i
think
if
any
person,
prosecuting
attorney
or
anyone
else
attempted
to
use
the
statute
in
a
--
and
under
the
facts
that
wouldn't
constitute
solicitation
or
demurrer
filed
to
the
indictment,
a
demurrer
filed
to
the
complaint
raising
a
question
that
it
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
law
under
the
state
of
alabama,
the
courts
would
have
a
review
of
the
conduct
of
the
individual
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
court
in
its
opinion
thought
that
this
alleged,
where
it
might
be
who
was
accused
of
violating
it,
did
electioneer
or
solicit
votes
for
an
individual
or
candidate
on
election
day.
i
thank
you.
mr.
burgin
hawkins
in
criminal
libel,
justice
black,
i've
never
had
a
criminal
libel
case
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
just
don't
--
mr.
burgin
hawkins
i
do
think
of
one
thing
that
these
statutes
being
penal
in
nature
are
certainly
be
strictly
construed.
and
with
that,
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
for
speaking
to
you.
thank
you.
