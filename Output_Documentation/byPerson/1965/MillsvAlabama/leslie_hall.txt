mr.
leslie
hall
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
want
to
address
myself
first
a
little
bit
to
this
matter
of
jurisdiction.
it
seems
to
me
in
my
impression
from
the
argument
given
by
mr.
swedlaw,
was
that
he
was
asking
this
court
to
give
an
advisory
opinion.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
things
like
that
and
i
hope
it
doesn't
start
doing
it
now.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
court
has
reserved
decision
on
the
jurisdictional
question
in
this
particular
case.
now,
i
want
to
go
into
something
with
regard
to
the
merits.
mr.
perrine
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
i'm
not
going
to
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
go
too
much
into
that
because
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
actually
mr.
hawkins
and
i
are
quite
interested
in
getting
the
decision
as
far
as
the
constitutionality.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
wouldn't
waste
the
court's
time
too
much
on
that.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
now,
as
far
as
this
particular
editorial
is
concerned,
it
didn't
fall
in
the
category
of
news.
there's
a
distinction
between
news
and
a
distinction
between
editorializing
and
solicitation
of
votes
on
election
day.
something
was
read
here
with
regard
to
the
last
paragraph
in
that
particular
editorial
in
which
it
said,
birmingham
and
the
people
of
birmingham
deserve
a
better
break,
a
vote
for
mayor-council
government
will
give
it
to
them.
but
we
should
backup
a
little
bit
and
go
back
to
the
preceding
paragraph.
and
the
preceding
paragraph
has
only
one
sentence.
let's
take
no
chances.
that
was
the
thing
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
was
referring
to
a
little
while
ago
as
to
what
actually
that
editorial
meant.
it
meant
to
the
people
to
come
out
on
that
particular
day
and
vote
for
that
particular
proposition.
and
i
admit
that
and
not
against.
mr.
leslie
hall
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
would
have,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
leslie
hall
they
--
the
part
of
the
objection
to
is
the
effect
that
they
solicited
votes
for
a
particular
proposition.
and
that's
what
the
statute
forbids.
mr.
leslie
hall
that
would
be
--
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
he
can
express
--
he
can
write
views
on
that
day.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
believe
it
would.
i
believe
it
would,
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
believe
it
would,
sir.
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
actually,
mr.
hawkins
can
give
you
a
little
bit
of
background
on
this
particular
thing
because
he
lives
there
in
birmingham
but
--
mr.
leslie
hall
when
he
get
a
little
bit
of
that
with
mr.
hanes
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
well,
i
don't
know.
if
you
write
a
general
proposition,
probably
it
would
be
alright
but
if
you
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well
now,
billboard
is
a
different
proposition
there.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
billboards
have
been
up
there
all
the
time
and
they
went
up
on
election
day.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
believe
so.
what
do
you
mean?
we
are
supposed
to
have
everybody
take
them
down
on
election
day?
mr.
leslie
hall
i
agree
with
you.
i
lived
over
here
in
virginia
for
19
years
and
these
just
stand
out
there
on
the
sidewalks
and
handout
the
cards.
i
guess
they
still
do
it.
mr.
leslie
hall
no.
the
main
thing
that
we've
rather
add
here
is
that
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
think
if
there's
any
question
about
the
definiteness
of
the
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
no.
the
only
one
who
is
responsible
is
the
one
who
composed
the
editorial.
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
it
couldn't
be
one.
however
--
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
that
may
be
true.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
think
no
sir.
i
don't
know
of
any,
mr.
justice
fortas.
this
is
the
only
case
we
know
about
in
my
experience.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
only
newspaper
case
that
i
only
think
of.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
not
in
recent
years.
we
have
never
had
one
go
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
until
this
case
came
up.
mr.
hawkins
will
resume
after
lunch.
mr.
leslie
hall
to
carryout
a
bit.
