justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
--
if
you
lose
here,
what
will
you
do?plead
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
already
been
convicted.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
now,
would
you
plead
guilty
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
the
jury
--
is
the
jury
--
you
have
a
jury
trial
if
you
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
de
novo?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
jury
find
you
not
guilty
if
you
--
if
you
just
went
to
trial
and
offered
no
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
they
do,
just
judge
the
facts
in
alabama
or
do
they
judge
the
law
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
pope,
in
carrying
those
cases,
really
went
on
the
ground
that
--
that
the
state
court
that
--
the
court
that
tried
the
case
had
no
jurisdiction
to
try
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
it
was
right
with
adjudication
because
the
court
purported
to
give
the
adjudication
really
shouldn't
have
given
them
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
georgia
court
has
no
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
most
completely
on
the
pope
approach.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
also
--
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
also
rely
on
not
because
on
its
facts
the
same
on
dombrowski
notion
that
this
is
a
first
amendment
problem
and
in
that
sense
that
even
if
these
were
not
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
our
review,
it
may
be
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
could
just
do
your
breach
of
peace
statute
to
prevent
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
it
be
permissible
for
the
state
to
say
like,
“you
can't
stand
within
100
feet
from
the
poll
place”,
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
individually
ask
people
to
vote
for
me
if
i'm
running
and
--
or
to
vote
for
my
friend
who
is
running
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
order
to
--
and
yet
the
newspaper
should
be
able
to
write
an
editorial
and
sell
it
off
the
newsstand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
off
the
newsstand
101
feet
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
blocking
here
used
at
all.
you
just
talk
to
your
friend
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
within
100
feet?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
or
any
other
places
as
long
as
there
wasn't
a
breach
of
the
peace
(voice
overlap)
brought
in
this
title.
justice
byron

white
or
vice

justice

obstruct
or

obstruct
or

or
prevent
or

to
prevent
the
forming
of
the
line
of
the
voters
who
are
waiting
for
their
opportunity
or
time
to
enter
the
election
booth,
that's
fairly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he's
violated
the
law
that
even
if
he
didn't
say
“please
vote
for
john”
it
would
also
violated
that
his
last
paragraph
says
john
into
that
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
this
idea
--
the
city
--
he
just
wrote
this
editorial
that
said
generally,
the
city-council
type
of
government
is
a
poor
form
of
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
issue
--
if
the
issue
was
not
the
city-council
type
of
government
and
you're
writing
editorial
that
says,
“city-council
type
of
government
has
failed
all
over
the
united
states”,
then
you
have
electioneering
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
what
the
law
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
isn't,
why
people
are
spending
a
lot
of
money
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
could
be
more
than
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
newspaper
case
or
just
any
case
under
the
statute?
justice
byron

there
have
been
others
on
--
justice
byron

white
what
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you?
what
about
just
urging
people
to
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
electioneering
in
one
of
its
most
traditional
sense.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
urging
--
getting
out
to
vote
--
just
urging
people
to
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
tell
it
from
the
word.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
almost
anybody
would
think
that
was
electioneering.
it
may
be
not
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
competing
state
of
interest
really
is
involved
here,
mr.
hawkins?
what
does
the
statute
attempting
to
attain
or
to
protect
somebody
against?
what
is
the
evil
of
saying
that
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
why
should
they
keep
quiet?
and
then
you've
got
to
be,
if
you
certainly,
at
the
very
minimum,
you
have
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
--
justice
byron

--
that
the
state
is
being
served
