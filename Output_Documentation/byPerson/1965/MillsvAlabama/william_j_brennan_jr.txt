justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
swedlaw,
is
this
directly
involved
to
do
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
all?
i
mean
just
that
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
conceivable,
i
suppose,
juries
in
face
of
no
defense
with
acquitted
people
in
other
situations,
i
suppose
the
jury
in
circuit
court
could
acquit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
--
was
the
first
amendment
argument
addressed
in
the
--
addressed
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
instead?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
rejected
without
merit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
at
least
we
have
a
determination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
suppose
this
statute,
instead
of
reading
as
it
does,
there's
no
limitation,
it
just
says,
it's
a
crime
to
do
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes.
suppose
it
said
it's
a
crime
to
do
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes
on
election
day
within
an
area
of
100
feet
of
any
poll
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
quite
a
bit
of
conduct
involved
in
public
newspapers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
mr.
swedlaw
under
this
statute
as
it's
written,
if
this
editorial
had
appeared
--
that
this
very
editorial
had
appeared
in
montgomery
newspaper
on
birmingham's
election
day,
now,
the
author
of
the
montgomery
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
editorial
would
have
been
subject
to
prosecution
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
even
though
it
deals
with
the
birmingham
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
these
two
rely
to
this
argument,
doesn't
it,
pretty
much
under
first
amendment
aspect
of
electioneering
and
soliciting
and
if
you
have
some
business
coverage
in
which
you
said
were
dealing
with
first
amendment
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
doctrine
of
vagueness
particularly
requires
passage
of
the
publicity.
is
that
what
this
argument
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
electioneering
and
solicitation
doesn't
provide
that
kind
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
perrine
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perrine.
thank
you,
mr.
perrine.
we've
also
--
assuming
that
this
is
a
solicitation,
accepting
that(inaudible)
in
the
first
amendment
area
that
nevertheless
had
a
standing
(inaudible)
if
in
other
respects,
it's
the
other
people
have
said
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
have
to
rely
only
on
that
assuming
it's
a
solicitation
in
and
of
itself
as
first
amendment
proscribed
the
statement
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
irrespective
of
that
--
under
the
vagueness
argument,
you
are
standing
to
argue
that
is
it's
too
vague
as
applied
to
other
people.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
billboards
and
all
of
those.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
specific
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
though
--
your
vagueness
argument,
as
i
understood,
goes
on
to
(inaudible)
any
electioneering
or
the
soliciting
of
votes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
the
suggestion
that
he
was
trying
to
make,
a
mobile
type
of
a
billboard,
or
billboard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
can
expose
all
the
billboard
that
says,
vote
to
change
to
change
to
whatever
it
is,
you
need
the
exact
--
the
last
sentence
of
this
editorial,
is
that
somewhere
within
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
still
there
on
election
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
come
within
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
--
it
certainly
said,
to
do
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes
and
my
hypothesis
is
a
billboard
which
says
vote
for
or
vote
against
whatever
its
proposition
was,
that's
all
it
says.
wouldn't
that
mean
solicitation
or
electioneering
on
election
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
this
newspaper
on
election
day
had
an
editorial
and
a
paper
version,
a
whole
paper
--
a
paper
version
of
--
just
like
the
voting
which
says,
“vote
against
and
vote
for
this
form
of
government,”
would
that
have
been
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
this
goes
certainly
as
mr.
perrine's
argument
of
vagueness,
does
it
not?
would
it
be
reached
by
the
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
actually
gets
would
have
reached
the
verdict
and
i
take
that
the
business
manager
of
the
newspaper
and
the
sponsors
of
the
advertisements
should
all
be
prosecuted
and
criminally
convicted
under
your
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hawkins,
apparently,
those
two
words
are
used
in
different
sentence
though
is
it
not,
if
you
do
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes.
now,
what
you've
been
talking
about
and
what
your
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
it
seems
to
me
before
went
in
to
solicit
the
electioneering
obviously,
will
tend
to
be
voter
management.
at
least
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
might
it
not
--
might
it
not
be
broad
enough
to
reach
what
mr.
justice
white
suggests,
just
a
plea,
get
out
and
vote
without
saying
vote
for
whom.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
that's
my
point
it
seems
--
the
way
that
it's
exactly
driven.
it
seems
to
distinguish
between
electioneering,
on
the
one
hand,
and
soliciting
votes
or
promising
to
cast
any
vote
or
against
the
election
or
nomination
of
any
candidate
or
in
support
of
or
in
opposition
of
any
proposition.
electioneering
seems
to
be
something
distinct
from
any
of
those
other
things.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
least
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
supreme
court
has
not
told
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
supreme
court
has
not
suggested
that
it
means
anything
such
that
you're
asking
us
to
--
reading
from
it,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
swedlaw,
is
this
directly
involved
to
do
any
electioneering
or
to

justice
william
j.

is
that

i

just
that
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
conceivable,
i
suppose,
juries
in

of
no
defense
with
acquitted
people
in
other

i
suppose
the
jury
in

could
acquit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

would
you
--
was
the
first
amendment
argument
addressed
in
the
--
addressed
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
instead?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
rejected
without
merit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
at
least
we
have
a
determination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
suppose
this
statute,
instead
of
reading
as
it
does,
there's
no
limitation,
it
just
says,
it's
a

to

suppose
it
said
it's
a
crime
to
do
any
electioneering
or
to
solicit
any
votes
on
election
day
within
an
area
of
100
feet
of
any
poll
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
quite
a

of

justice
william

this

that

the

editorial
would
have
been
subject
to
prosecution
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
even
though
it
deals
with
the
birmingham
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
these
two
rely
to
this
argument,
doesn't
it,
pretty
much
under
first

aspect
of
electioneering
and
soliciting
and

have
some
business

and

is
that
what
this
argument
is?
justice
william

brennan,

--
electioneering

doesn't
provide
that
kind
of

justice
william

ask

mr.

perrine.
thank
you,
mr.

we've
also

assuming
that
this
is
a
solicitation,
accepting
that(inaudible)
in
the

area
that
nevertheless
had
a

(inaudible)
if
in

respects,
it's
the
other

it.
justice

you

to

on

of

the
statement
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

irrespective
of
that
--
under
the
vagueness
argument,
you
are
standing
to
argue
that
is
it's
too
vague
as
applied
to
other
people.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
billboards
and
all
of
those.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that's
a
specific
argument.

william

though

your

goes
