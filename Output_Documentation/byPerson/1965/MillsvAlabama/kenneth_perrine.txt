mr.
kenneth
perrine
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
take
that
up
in
rebuttal
and
use
it
all
at
one
time,
if
you
please.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
alright,
yes
sir,
i
would
be
glad
to.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
i
would
like
to
save
some
for
rebuttal
because
mine
is
all
mixed
up
in
that
situation.
this
statute,
section
285
provides
that
for
anyone,
anywhere
in
the
state
of
alabama
to
communicate
with
anyone
on
any
election
day,
and
it
could
be
interpreted
as
being
solicitation
for
electioneering.
now,
we
have
no
quarrel
whatsoever
with
a
--
the
corrupt
practices
act
as
such
which
is
directed
to
particular
and
specific
conduct,
but
where
it
goes
out
into
the
field
as
so
vague
as
to
what
might
be
any
solicitation
or
any
electioneering
on
election
day,
then
we
go
into
a
field
whereby
an
intelligent
person
might
well
ask
but
what
do
they
mean.
what
conduct
is
subscribed
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
what
is
it
that
i
might
do
or
i
might
not
do
that
would
be
consistent
with
electioneering
and
solicitation?
now,
while
we
recognize
mostly
that
solicitation
and
electioneering
is
understood
by
the
average
layman,
yet
we
find
that
there
are
many
faces
of
endeavor
in
which
we
could
wonder
whether
or
not
we
are
absolutely
in
that
particular
category.
if
you
wish
to
take
literally
this
field
of
solicitation
as
it
is
here,
it
would
mean
simply
this.
that
upon
election
day,
that
a
person
could
not
even
speak
to
his
wife
and
ask
her
to
go
down
to
the
polls
and
vote
for
his
friend
because
that
would
be
solicitation
or
electioneering.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
or
vice
versa.
usually,
it's
vice
versa.
a
chamber
of
commerce,
i
believe,
has
been
mentioned.
a
chamber
of
commerce
who
has
been
sponsoring
a
bond
movement
to
be
voted
on,
on
a
particular
day,
and
also,
as
any
chamber
of
commerce
has
done
has
gone
into
an
active
campaign
for
getting
out
the
vote.
and
yet
if
on
election
day,
they
proceeded
with
this
campaign
of
getting
out
the
vote,
it
could
be
interpreted
as
it
was
in
this
statute
--
in
this
case
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
it
could
be
interpreted
that
the
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
were
guilty
of
electioneering.
because
it
could
be
said
and
truthfully
so,
that
their
interest,
one
of
their
interest
not
only
in
getting
out
to
vote
as
the
civic
proposition
but
their
interest
in
getting
out
the
vote
was
to
pass
the
bond
issue
in
which
they
were
interested
in.
then
we
have
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
that
sir,
yes
sir.
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
there
is
no
definitive
wording
here
that
we
might
know
what
solicitation
would
be.
for
example,
it
is
common
practice
in
all
campaigns
to
use
billboards
for
the
candidate
to
express
his
platform
and
what
have
you,
alright.
they
say
no
election
--
there
shall
be
any
electioneering
on
election
day
but
what
is
the
situation
with
the
--
this
billboard
still
being
up
on
election
day
where
you
can
read
it
going
to
the
poll,
is
that
not
electioneering?
and
under
this
statute
which
says
there
can
be
any
no
electioneering,
no
solicitation
on
election
day,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
this
act
and
subject
the
candidate
or
whoever
put
up
that
billboard
to
a
criminal
penalty.
in
the
same
terminology
in
all
kinds
of
campaigns,
there
have
been
certain
types
of
literature
that
has
been
put
out
by
the
candidates.
and
if
this
is
in
evidence
on
election
day,
under
this
statute,
then
too
it
could
be
determined
to
be
electioneering
or
solicitation.
there
is
no
limitation
here
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
sir?
mr.
kenneth
perrine
well,
yes
and
no.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
your
honor,
i
agree
with
it
to
this
extent,
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
article
constituted
solicitation.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
that's
exactly
true.
it
does
seem
sort
of
like
it.
but
then
there
isn't
any
definite
conduct
prescribed
in
the
statute
which
says
that
that
is
a
solicitation.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes,
he
said
vote
--
he
said
vote
for
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
and
what
did
he
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
what
did
he
do
in
this
particular
case,
if
your
honor
please,
was
that
he
first
stated
the
facts
which
were
news
items
and
appeared
in
the
news
items
in
other
parts
of
the
paper.
and
then
he
gave
his
comment
upon
that
particular
news
item.
there
was
no
question
that
the
mayor
had
attempted
to
bribe
the
people
on
votes.
there's
no
question
that
the
mayor
had
attempted
to
put
a
blackout
on
the
city
hall
of
news.
and
he
merely
said
his
comment
in
an
editorial
that
that
is
another
good
reason
to
vote
for
the
city
--
change
in
the
city
form
of
government.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
i
think
it
was
a
solicitation
of
votes,
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
it.
but
i
might
call
the
attention
here.
i
believe
it
has
been
mentioned
before
in
this
particular
statement
in
this
regard
that
--
pamphlets
that
could
be
issued
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
obtaining
the
same
comment.
but
here
is
the
solicitation
by
a
newspaper
which
is
only
published
and
obtained
by
paid
subscribers.
it's
not
some
pamphlet
that's
handed
down
up
on
the
street
corners
as
you
pass
by
or
as
you
approach
the
polls
and
does
not
come
in
that
category.so
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
vague
in
that
regard.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
perrine.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
as
i've
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
in
and
of
itself
which
says
that
we
must
have
freedom
of
speech.
the
very
foundation
of
our
government
is
the
freedom
of
speech
and
particularly
in
the
political.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir,
not
only
--
not
only
to
the
billboards,
it
applies
as
vague
as
to
individuals,
as
to
the
press,
as
to
the
radio,
as
to
the
tv,
or
in
fact
any
type
of
communications
under
this
section.
and
i
believe
that
that
was
adequately
expressed
by
this
court
originally
in
the
thornhill
against
the
state
of
alabama
case
in
which
this
general
principle
was
involved,
that
you
could
not
subscribe
to
and
curtail
the
freedom
of
speech
unless
it
is
specific
or
directed
to
certain
conduct.
and
this
is
no
conduct
directed
here.
there's
no
particular
act
involved.
yes,
he
wrote
an
editorial
which
could
be
read
by
the
people
if
they
so
desire.
it
was
no
button
holding.
there
was
no
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
they
objected
the
fact
that
he
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
what
he
said,
his
speech.
this
broad
no
solicitation
rule,
i
believe,
was
asked
as
far
as
not
in
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act.
it's
not
in
46
states.
i
believe
there
are
only
four
states
that
have
a
similar
broad
rule
as
we
have
here,
alabama
being
one
of
them.
and
none
of
those
states
has
yet
passed
upon
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
act
as
it
had
been
brought
before
us.
we
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
presumed
that
the
people
will
know
in
their
own
minds
what
is
solicitation
and
electioneering.
now,
if
you
have
specific
conduct
directed
as
it
has
been
many
times
in
many
statutes
within
100
feet
of
the
poll,
that
you
will
not
have
the
passing
out
of
pamphlets,
you
will
not
have
the
button
holding
of
people
who
would
be
obstructed
in
their
line
of
march
to
the
polling
place,
that
you
will
not
have
loud
sound
trucks,
all
of
those
things
are
specific
conduct
which
can
be
defined.
yes,
they
are
all
electioneering
and
they're
all
solicitation
but
where
you
put
any
solicitation
or
any
electioneering
without
any
specific
conduct
being
prescribed
in
that
particular
area,
then
you
will
think
that
there
can
be
no
communication.
now,
if
you
read
this
statute
in
its
entirety
as
to
what
it
says,
this
section
285.
now,
we're
not
attacking
the
corrupt
practices
act
of
the
state
of
alabama
as
a
whole,
but
only
this
one
particular
section.
and
what
this
one
particular
section
says,
that
on
any
election
day,
anywhere
in
the
state
of
alabama,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
a
municipal
election,
a
county
election,
a
state
election
or
a
federal
election,
just
so
an
election
is
being
held,
that
anyone
in
the
state
of
alabama
whether
it's
an
individual,
whether
it's
an
editor
of
a
newspaper,
whether
it's
a
radio
or
television
who
solicits
any
vote
or
does
any
electioneering
on
that
date,
and
as
expressed
that
the
state
--
if
the
election
as
being
held
in
birmingham
but
the
statement
is
made
in
mobil,
it's
still
a
violation
of
this
act
because
there's
no
conduct
prescribed,
and
there's
no
time
element
involved.
there's
no
place
involved
in
this
particular
thing.
it
was
not
delimited
in
any
direction.
and
we
state
that
from
the
standpoint
of
being
vague
and
indefinite,
that
this
statute
does
not
meet
the
requirements
that
have
been
handed
down
by
this
court
particularly
when
those
requirements
are
infringing
upon
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
no
sir,
there
has
been
no
construction
of
this
section.
there
have
been
many
constructions
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
--
but
nowhere
in
the
--
nowhere
have
we
found
any
construction
of
a
broad,
no
solicitation,
no
electioneering
rule
on
election
day.
and
as
i've
stated,
there
are
only
four
states
that
have
such
election.
all
the
other
states
confined
it
to
within
so
many
feet
of
the
polling
place
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
--
and
to
specific
acts?
mr.
kenneth
perrine
no
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
nowhere.
well,
maybe
in
some
places.
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
not
familiar
of
any
ordinance
which
had
been
upheld
by
any
court
which
would
put
a
blanket
expression
upon
the
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
if
you
start
--
if
you
start
off,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
i
think
that
part
of
it
is
there
and
if
they
stop
there,
it
would
be
fine
but
if
you
go
on,
i'll
show
the
--
how
inaccurate
this
section
are
loosely
drawn
and
then
it
goes
on
to
prescribe
that
any
person
who
hires
a
vehicle
to
take
into
the
polls,
or
any
person
who
hires
out
a
vehicle
is
guilty
of
a
violation
on
this
act.
and
which
should
mean
that
if
a
voter
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
go
to
the
polls,
he
couldn't
hire
a
taxicab
because
if
he
did,
that's
hiring
a
vehicle
to
go
to
the
polls,
and
he
would
be
guilty
of
a
violation
of
this
act.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
that's
the
specific
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir,
but
i
was
illustrating
how
this
particular
section
was
so
loosely
drawn
as
to
be
unconstitutionally
vague
in
that
regard
because
i'm
sure
that
they
didn't
intend
to
say
that
a
taxicab
should
be
guilty
of
a
crime
by
merely
hired
it,
taking
a
passenger
to
the
polls.
and
yet,
that's
what
this
statute
says.
and
therefore,
in
that
standpoint,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
restrictions
of
rights
there.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir,
i
do
because
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
invasion
of
their
freedom
of
speech
and
their
right
of
expression.
and
in
that
connection,
i
might
call
your
attention
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
holding
of
their
elections.
and
they
have
held
their
elections
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
clinical
laboratory.
and
yet
in
the
national
labor
relations
board,
they
say
that
you
can
talk
to
your
people
as
long
as
it's
not
within
100
feet
of
the
polling
place.
they
also
confined
it
to
the
times
when
the
polls
are
open.
here,
you
got
a
24-hour
period
involved.
the
polls
open
from
7:00
to
7:00
and
yet
a
blanket
of
silence
is
placed
upon
all
of
the
electorate
of
the
state
of
alabama
for
the
entire
day,
not
for
just
the
time
the
polls
were
opened.
the
national
labor
relations
board
elections
is
only
the
time
that
the
polls
to
vote
--
or
open,
that
the
requirement
is
that
you
cannot
electioneer
or
you
cannot
solicit
the
employee
within
100
feet
of
the
polls.
now
certainly,
with
all
of
the
care
that
they
have
used
in
the
nlrb
in
holding
their
elections,
to
say
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
cannot
use
their
own
intelligence
and
talk
to
people
any
time,
any
place
in
the
state
of
alabama
for
the
day
is
such
a
vague
proposition
that
it
would
run
right
into
the
teeth
of
the
constitutionality
and
this
act
should
be
declared
unconstitutional.
does
that
answer
that
portion
of
the
question
regard
to
the
--
as
i
have
previously
stated,
there's
nothing
here
in
regard
to
the
geographical
area.
everywhere
in
the
state
of
alabama
is
restricted.
that
is
the
vagueness
of
this
particular
statute.
and
it's
difficult
to
talk
about
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
without
going
into
the
first
amendment
rights
because
they're
all
mixed
up
together
and
the
same
as
it
is
with
the
jurisdictional
rights.
they're
all
intertwined
and
i've
attempted
to
bring
out
at
this
time
the
vagueness
with
saving
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
may
it
please
the
court,
i
will
take
that
up
in
rebuttal
and
use
it
all
at
one
time,
if
you
please.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
alright,
yes
sir,
i
would
be
glad
to.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
i
would
like
to
save
some
for
rebuttal
because
mine
is
all
mixed
up
in
that
situation.
this
statute,
section
285
provides
that
for
anyone,
anywhere
in
the
state
of
alabama
to
communicate
with
anyone
on
any
election
day,
and
it
could
be
interpreted
as
being
solicitation
for
electioneering.
now,
we
have
no
quarrel
whatsoever
with
a
--
the
corrupt
practices
act
as
such
which
is
directed
to
particular
and
specific
conduct,
but
where
it
goes
out
into
the
field
as
so
vague
as
to
what
might
be
any
solicitation
or
any
electioneering
on
election
day,
then
we
go
into
a
field
whereby
an
intelligent
person
might
well
ask
but
what
do
they
mean.
what
conduct
is
subscribed
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
what
is
it
that
i
might
do
or
i
might
not
do
that
would
be
consistent
with
electioneering
and
solicitation?
now,
while
we
recognize
mostly
that
solicitation
and
electioneering
is
understood
by
the
average
layman,
yet
we
find
that
there
are
many
faces
of
endeavor
in
which
we
could
wonder
whether
or
not
we
are
absolutely
in
that
particular
category.
if
you
wish
to
take
literally
this
field
of
solicitation
as
it
is
here,
it
would
mean
simply
this.
that
upon
election
day,
that
a
person
could
not
even
speak
to
his
wife
and
ask
her
to
go
down
to
the
polls
and
vote
for
his
friend
because
that
would
be
solicitation
or
electioneering.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
or
vice
versa.
usually,
it's
vice
versa.
a
chamber
of
commerce,
i
believe,
has
been
mentioned.
a
chamber
of
commerce
who
has
been
sponsoring
a
bond
movement
to
be
voted
on,
on
a
particular
day,
and
also,
as
any
chamber
of
commerce
has
done
has
gone
into
an
active
campaign
for
getting
out
the
vote.
and
yet
if
on
election
day,
they
proceeded
with
this
campaign
of
getting
out
the
vote,
it
could
be
interpreted
as
it
was
in
this
statute
--
in
this
case
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
it
could
be
interpreted
that
the
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
were
guilty
of
electioneering.
because
it
could
be
said
and
truthfully
so,
that
their
interest,
one
of
their
interest
not
only
in
getting
out
to
vote
as
the
civic
proposition
but
their
interest
in
getting
out
the
vote
was
to
pass
the
bond
issue
in
which
they
were
interested
in.
then
we
have
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
that
sir,
yes
sir.
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
there
is
no
definitive
wording
here
that
we
might
know
what
solicitation
would
be.
for
example,
it
is
common
practice
in
all
campaigns
to
use
billboards
for
the
candidate
to
express
his
platform
and
what
have
you,
alright.
they
say
no
election
--
there
shall
be
any
electioneering
on
election
day
but
what
is
the
situation
with
the
--
this
billboard
still
being
up
on
election
day
where
you
can
read
it
going
to
the
poll,
is
that
not
electioneering?
and
under
this
statute
which
says
there
can
be
any
no
electioneering,
no
solicitation
on
election
day,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
this
act
and
subject
the
candidate
or
whoever
put
up
that
billboard
to
a
criminal
penalty.
in
the
same
terminology
in
all
kinds
of
campaigns,
there
have
been
certain
types
of
literature
that
has
been
put
out
by
the
candidates.
and
if
this
is
in
evidence
on
election
day,
under
this
statute,
then
too
it
could
be
determined
to
be
electioneering
or
solicitation.
there
is
no
limitation
here
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
sir?
mr.
kenneth
perrine
well,
yes
and
no.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
your
honor,
i
agree
with
it
to
this
extent,
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
article
constituted
solicitation.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
that's
exactly
true.
it
does
seem
sort
of
like
it.
but
then
there
isn't
any
definite
conduct
prescribed
in
the
statute
which
says
that
that
is
a
solicitation.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes,
he
said
vote
--
he
said
vote
for
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
and
what
did
he
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
what
did
he
do
in
this
particular
case,
if
your
honor
please,
was
that
he
first
stated
the
facts
which
were
news
items
and
appeared
in
the
news
items
in
other
parts
of
the
paper.
and
then
he
gave
his
comment
upon
that
particular
news
item.
there
was
no
question
that
the
mayor
had
attempted
to
bribe
the
people
on
votes.
there's
no
question
that
the
mayor
had
attempted
to
put
a
blackout
on
the
city
hall
of
news.
and
he
merely
said
his
comment
in
an
editorial
that
that
is
another
good
reason
to
vote
for
the
city
--
change
in
the
city
form
of
government.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
i
think
it
was
a
solicitation
of
votes,
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
it.
but
i
might
call
the
attention
here.
i
believe
it
has
been
mentioned
before
in
this
particular
statement
in
this
regard
that
--
pamphlets
that
could
be
issued
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
obtaining
the
same
comment.
but
here
is
the
solicitation
by
a
newspaper
which
is
only
published
and
obtained
by
paid
subscribers.
it's
not
some
pamphlet
that's
handed
down
up
on
the
street
corners
as
you
pass
by
or
as
you
approach
the
polls
and
does
not
come
in
that
category.so
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
vague
in
that
regard.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
perrine.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
as
i've
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
in
and
of
itself
which
says
that
we
must
have
freedom
of
speech.
the
very
foundation
of
our
government
is
the
freedom
of
speech
and
particularly
in
the
political.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir,
not
only
--
not
only
to
the
billboards,
it
applies
as
vague
as
to
individuals,
as
to
the
press,
as
to
the
radio,
as
to
the
tv,
or
in
fact
any
type
of
communications
under
this
section.
and
i
believe
that
that
was
adequately
expressed
by
this
court
originally
in
the
thornhill
against
the
state
of
alabama
case
in
which
this
general
principle
was
involved,
that
you
could
not
subscribe
to
and
curtail
the
freedom
of
speech
unless
it
is
specific
or
directed
to
certain
conduct.
and
this
is
no
conduct
directed
here.
there's
no
particular
act
involved.
yes,
he
wrote
an
editorial
which
could
be
read
by
the
people
if
they
so
desire.
it
was
no
button
holding.
there
was
no
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
they
objected
the
fact
that
he
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
what
he
said,
his
speech.
this
broad
no
solicitation
rule,
i
believe,
was
asked
as
far
as
not
in
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act.
it's
not
in
46
states.
i
believe
there
are
only
four
states
that
have
a
similar
broad
rule
as
we
have
here,
alabama
being
one
of
them.
and
none
of
those
states
has
yet
passed
upon
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
act
as
it
had
been
brought
before
us.
we
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
presumed
that
the
people
will
know
in
their
own
minds
what
is
solicitation
and
electioneering.
now,
if
you
have
specific
conduct
directed
as
it
has
been
many
times
in
many
statutes
within
100
feet
of
the
poll,
that
you
will
not
have
the
passing
out
of
pamphlets,
you
will
not
have
the
button
holding
of
people
who
would
be
obstructed
in
their
line
of
march
to
the
polling
place,
that
you
will
not
have
loud
sound
trucks,
all
of
those
things
are
specific
conduct
which
can
be
defined.
yes,
they
are
all
electioneering
and
they're
all
solicitation
but
where
you
put
any
solicitation
or
any
electioneering
without
any
specific
conduct
being
prescribed
in
that
particular
area,
then
you
will
think
that
there
can
be
no
communication.
now,
if
you
read
this
statute
in
its
entirety
as
to
what
it
says,
this
section
285.
now,
we're
not
attacking
the
corrupt
practices
act
of
the
state
of
alabama
as
a
whole,
but
only
this
one
particular
section.
and
what
this
one
particular
section
says,
that
on
any
election
day,
anywhere
in
the
state
of
alabama,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
a
municipal
election,
a
county
election,
a
state
election
or
a
federal
election,
just
so
an
election
is
being
held,
that
anyone
in
the
state
of
alabama
whether
it's
an
individual,
whether
it's
an
editor
of
a
newspaper,
whether
it's
a
radio
or
television
who
solicits
any
vote
or
does
any
electioneering
on
that
date,
and
as
expressed
that
the
state
--
if
the
election
as
being
held
in
birmingham
but
the
statement
is
made
in
mobil,
it's
still
a
violation
of
this
act
because
there's
no
conduct
prescribed,
and
there's
no
time
element
involved.
there's
no
place
involved
in
this
particular
thing.
it
was
not
delimited
in
any
direction.
and
we
state
that
from
the
standpoint
of
being
vague
and
indefinite,
that
this
statute
does
not
meet
the
requirements
that
have
been
handed
down
by
this
court
particularly
when
those
requirements
are
infringing
upon
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
no
sir,
there
has
been
no
construction
of
this
section.
there
have
been
many
constructions
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
--
but
nowhere
in
the
--
nowhere
have
we
found
any
construction
of
a
broad,
no
solicitation,
no
electioneering
rule
on
election
day.
and
as
i've
stated,
there
are
only
four
states
that
have
such
election.
all
the
other
states
confined
it
to
within
so
many
feet
of
the
polling
place
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
--
and
to
specific
acts?
mr.
kenneth
perrine
no
sir.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
nowhere.
well,
maybe
in
some
places.
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
not
familiar
of
any
ordinance
which
had
been
upheld
by
any
court
which
would
put
a
blanket
expression
upon
the
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
if
you
start
--
if
you
start
off,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
i
think
that
part
of
it
is
there
and
if
they
stop
there,
it
would
be
fine
but
if
you
go
on,
i'll
show
the
--
how
inaccurate
this
section
are
loosely
drawn
and
then
it
goes
on
to
prescribe
that
any
person
who
hires
a
vehicle
to
take
into
the
polls,
or
any
person
who
hires
out
a
vehicle
is
guilty
of
a
violation
on
this
act.
and
which
should
mean
that
if
a
voter
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
go
to
the
polls,
he
couldn't
hire
a
taxicab
because
if
he
did,
that's
hiring
a
vehicle
to
go
to
the
polls,
and
he
would
be
guilty
of
a
violation
of
this
act.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
that's
the
specific
--
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir,
but
i
was
illustrating
how
this
particular
section
was
so
loosely
drawn
as
to
be
unconstitutionally
vague
in
that
regard
because
i'm
sure
that
they
didn't
intend
to
say
that
a
taxicab
should
be
guilty
of
a
crime
by
merely
hired
it,
taking
a
passenger
to
the
polls.
and
yet,
that's
what
this
statute
says.
and
therefore,
in
that
standpoint,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
restrictions
of
rights
there.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
yes
sir,
i
do
because
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
invasion
of
their
freedom
of
speech
and
their
right
of
expression.
and
in
that
connection,
i
might
call
your
attention
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
holding
of
their
elections.
and
they
have
held
their
elections
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
clinical
laboratory.
and
yet
in
the
national
labor
relations
board,
they
say
that
you
can
talk
to
your
people
as
long
as
it's
not
within
100
feet
of
the
polling
place.
they
also
confined
it
to
the
times
when
the
polls
are
open.
here,
you
got
a
24-hour
period
involved.
the
polls
open
from
7:00
to
7:00
and
yet
a
blanket
of
silence
is
placed
upon
all
of
the
electorate
of
the
state
of
alabama
for
the
entire
day,
not
for
just
the
time
the
polls
were
opened.
the
national
labor
relations
board
elections
is
only
the
time
that
the
polls
to
vote
--
or
open,
that
the
requirement
is
that
you
cannot
electioneer
or
you
cannot
solicit
the
employee
within
100
feet
of
the
polls.
now
certainly,
with
all
of
the
care
that
they
have
used
in
the
nlrb
in
holding
their
elections,
to
say
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
cannot
use
their
own
intelligence
and
talk
to
people
any
time,
any
place
in
the
state
of
alabama
for
the
day
is
such
a
vague
proposition
that
it
would
run
right
into
the
teeth
of
the
constitutionality
and
this
act
should
be
declared
unconstitutional.
does
that
answer
that
portion
of
the
question
regard
to
the
--
as
i
have
previously
stated,
there's
nothing
here
in
regard
to
the
geographical
area.
everywhere
in
the
state
of
alabama
is
restricted.
that
is
the
vagueness
of
this
particular
statute.
and
it's
difficult
to
talk
about
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
without
going
into
the
first
amendment
rights
because
they're
all
mixed
up
together
and
the
same
as
it
is
with
the
jurisdictional
rights.
they're
all
intertwined
and
i've
attempted
to
bring
out
at
this
time
the
vagueness
with
saving
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
perrine
thank
you.
