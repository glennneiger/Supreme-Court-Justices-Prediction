sense
either
even
to

mr.

may
i
ask

mr.
hawkins,
may
i
ask
you
this.
suppose
one
side
in
an
election
launches
a
scurrilous
attack
upon
the
other
side
about
an
hour
before
midnight,
the
night
before
election,
is
it
reasonable,
is
it
fair
to
prevent
free
speech
in
order
to
oppose
that
next
day?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
let's
take
another
one.
now,
suppose
the
man,
one
man
who's
running
for
office
admits
in
some
other
context
an
hour
before
the
election
that
he's
been
guilty
of
bribery.
do
you
think
that
the
opposition
would
have
no
right
to
expose
that
to
the
public
the
next
day?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
not
have
the
right
to
say
in
addition
to
that
that
it
is
a
view
of
this
newspaper
that
a
man
who
has
just
admitted
his
guilt
of
bribery
should
not
be
reelected
to
this
office?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
say
if
it
were
a
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does
bring
--
chief
justice
earl
warren

a
hard
