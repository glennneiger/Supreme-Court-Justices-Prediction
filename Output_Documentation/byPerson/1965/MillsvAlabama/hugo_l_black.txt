justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
presented
that
--
in
relation
on
that
is
whether
not
having
them
to
finally
determine
that
he
would
be
guilty
as
he's
tried
and
had
to
be
found
guilty
but
you
don't
want
to
be
sent
back
down
there
just
to
proceed
up
and
when
you
went
through
the
various
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
they
can
make
it
illegal
for
a
candidate
to
hire
a
host
and
make
a
speech
on
election
day,
there's
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
make
it
as
a
crime
for
him
to
make
a
speech
five
days
before
election
day,
it's
the
only
ground
that
they
didn't
want
to
make
that
late.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
say
they
hope
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
be
attacking
the
statute
if
it
had
been
construed
this
meaning
if
he
couldn't
go
down
to
poll
and
stand
there
and
beg
voters
and
have
40
people
standing
and
beg
voters
to
move
one
way
or
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
a
man
should
have
the
right
to
say
anything
he
wants
to,
anytime
he
wants
to
at
anyplace
he
wants
to
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
the
state
might
want
the
street
be
used
for
some
other
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
they
have
the
right
to
go
anywhere
they
want
and
say
anything
they
please
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
even
if
the
city
tries
to
keep
certain
streets,
they're
not
going
to
have
you
on
why
it
shouldn't
have
been
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
have
to
go
that
far
to
decide
it
with
you
the
other
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
object
to
the
conduct,
did
they?
they
objected
to
what
he
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you're
trying
to
defend
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
they're
violating
the
law
to
have
just
said
the
people
to
come
out
and
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
only
part
they
objected
to
is
decide
its
own
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
an
editor
can
write
that
on
election
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
an
editor
cannot
say
on
election
day
in
an
editorial
in
the
papers
in
the
public
(inaudible)
perhaps
illegally
published,
and
expresses
views
on
how
people
should
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
can
write
--
suppose
he
writes
--
expresses
his
views,
but
i
hope
that
you're
going
to
vote
certain
ways
today,
that
would
violate
the
law
there,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
violate
that
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
have
a
ghost
writer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
have
a
ghost
writer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
--
it
could
be
more
than
one.
he
have
the
newspaper
and
also
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
the
editorial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
the
editorial,
we're
talking
now
about
the
editorial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
about
the
riot
and
disordered
polls.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
disordered
polls,
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
it
sounds
to
me
like
what
your
statute
really
want
after.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
polls?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
wouldn't
do
that
at
the
polls.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
wouldn't
be
there
at
the
polls.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he'd
be
back
at
the
editorial
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
mr.
hawkins?
as
i
recall
alabama,
it
does
not
have
a
provision
in
the
constitution
which
makes
the
jury
the
judge
who
brought
the
law
in
facts
and
criminal
libel
cases,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
this
has
many
arguments.
this
has
not
named
that
but
it's
a
kind
of
thing,
it
was
a
criminal
libel
in
the
old
days.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
wondering.
i
didn't
think
that
that
provision
is
in
the
constitution
at
this
time
of
alabama.
