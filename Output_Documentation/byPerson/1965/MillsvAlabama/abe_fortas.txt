justice
abe
fortas
does
that
mean
that
you
do
conceive
that
the
publication
of
this
editorial
constituted
electioneering
or
the
solicitation
of
votes
on
election
day?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
--
you
don't
dispute
that
and
you
represent
to
us
that
if
you
went
back
to
trial,
you
would
not
dispute
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
to
the
same
effect
as
if
that
conclusion
we
arrived
at,
at
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
didn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
making
any
distinction
between
something
that's
published
in
a
newspaper
and
something
that
is
published
in
a
pamphlet
and
distributed
--
justice
abe
fortas
let's
suppose
at
some
--
the
chamber
--
the
local
chamber
of
commerce
turned
up
exactly
the
same
editorial,
it
is
to
every
word
exactly
the
same.
but
instead
of
putting
it
in
a
newspaper,
the
chamber
of
commerce
had
distributed
it
on
election
day.
now,
you
say
we're
bound
to
regard
the
editorial
as
electioneering
or
solicitation
of
votes.
and
the
pamphlet
in
the
example
i'm
putting
to
you
would
the
electioneering
or
soliciting
of
votes
that
both
occur
on
election
day.
are
you
asking
us
to
draw
a
distinction
between
two
things
on
the
grounds
that
one
was
a
newspaper
and
the
other
was
just
a
handout?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
a
speech
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
election
day?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
the
rule
which
i
guess
is
quite
prevalent
in
the
united
states
dropping
the
curtain
on
election
activities
on
election
day.
do
you
think
that
that
--
that
that
rule
prohibiting
electioneering
on
election
day
is
unconstitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
whatever
form
of
electioneering
may
take?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
the
usual
defense,
i
suppose,
of
these
statutes
prohibiting
electioneering
on
election
day
is
that
they
avoid
disorder
on
election
day
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
number
one,
and
number
two,
they
reduce
the
possibility
that
somebody
will
make
a
last
minute
sensational
announcement
that
would
panic
people
and
which
may
not
be
true.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
in
your
part?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
you
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
for
a
state
or
municipality
to
provide
that
you
can't
get
any
electioneering
within
100
feet
of
the
voting
place.
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
in
the
place
where
the
voting
takes
place?
justice
abe
fortas
the
alternative
though
would
be
to
say
to
withdraw
a
line
of
what
is
an
unreasonable
restraint,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
you're
going
to
say
that
--
and
your
argument
would
be
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
that
preventing
electioneering
on
the
day
before
--
or
election
day
is
unreasonable,
do
you
have
in
your
brief
--
i've
forgotten,
any
indication
of
how
widespread
such
statutes
and
ordinances
are?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
mean
corrupt
practices
act.
i
mean
this
specific
type
of
provision.
justice
abe
fortas
where
it
says
you
can't
electioneer
on
election
day.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
there
is
no
doubt
about
this
particular
incident,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
i
say
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
particular
editorial
was
a
solicitation
of
votes,
you
probably
just
said
that.
and
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you've
used
that
by
saying
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
last
paragraph
of
the
editorial
says,
“birmingham
and
the
people
of
birmingham
deserve
a
better
break.
a
vote
for
mayor-council
government
will
give
it
to
them.”
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
it
says.
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
you
--
that
does
seem
sort
of
like
a
solicitation
of
votes,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
said
vote
for
the
mayor-council
government
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
phrase
it.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
tell
us
how
you
phrase
it.
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
municipal
ordinance
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
this
effect?
are
there
municipal
ordinance
as
to
the
same
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
nowhere.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
labor
union
had
a
meeting
on
election
day,
got
its
members
together
and
the
labor
union
officials
who
rang
them
and
pull
them
out
to
vote.
and
they
were
then
--
go
into
the
polls,
would
you
consider
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
that
sort
of
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
know
whether
anybody
else
of
this
record
or
anybody
else
having
been
prosecuted
under
this
particular
(voice
