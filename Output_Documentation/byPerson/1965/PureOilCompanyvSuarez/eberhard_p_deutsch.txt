mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
was
an
action
instituted
by
a
seaman
who
was
a
resident
of
the
northern
district
of
florida
against
the
petitioner
here,
the
respondent
below,
pure
oil
company
instituted
under
the
jones
act
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
in
which
the
petitioner,
pure
oil
company
does
business.
it
is
however
an
ohio
corporation
with
its
principal
office
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
at
this
point
i
should
like
briefly
to
trace
a
phase
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
jones
act
which
strangely
has
never
been
discussed
in
any
of
the
decisions
in
this
or
any
other
cases
involving
anything
in
the
nature
of
the
issue
here
presented.
it
has
been
stated
frequently
that
the
purpose
of
the
jones
act
was
to
expand
the
rights
of
seamen
and
i
think
that
is
true
except
in
the
point
here
at
issue
on
which
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
it
was
expressly
and
clearly
intended
to
restrict
the
venue
of
seaman’s
actions
under
the
jones
act.
that
the
statute
in
the
course
of
its
enactment
was
part
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1920
and
the
jones
act
itself
was
the
creature
of
senator
wesley
jones
of
the
state
of
washington
who
proposed
it
to
give
seamen
the
right
of
action
for
negligent,
the
sort
of
common
law
right
of
action
in
federal
and
state
courts
to
be
governed,
as
it
came
out
originally,
by
the
provisions
of
a
federal
employers
liability
act.
the
house
objected
to
that
latter
provision
insofar
as
venue
was
concerned
because
the
federal
employers
liability
act
provides
for
venue
in
any
jurisdiction
in
which
the
respondent
is
doing
business.
after
three
or
in
the
course
of
three-senate
house
conferences
the
position
of
the
house
of
representatives
was
to
accepted
for
the
senate
conferees
and
the
statute
was
enacted
to
provide
that
only
the
court
of
the
residence
or
of
the
principal
office
of
the
respondent
should
have
jurisdiction
as
it
is
called
and
now
that
has
been
held
to
mean
venue.
i
repeat
that
that
restrictive
provision
in
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
regarding
that,
has
never
been
mentioned
by
any
court
so
far
as
i
know
in
this
or
in
any
of
the
other
cases
and
there
have
been
several,
three
at
least,
involving
the
precise
point
at
issue
here.
it
was
discussed.
it
was
put
in
the
briefs.
it
was
put
in
application
for
rehearing
in
the
court
below
in
this
case.
it
was
argued.
it
was
presented
and
the
matter
was
not
mentioned.
now
until
1948
with
the
revision,
general
revision
of
the
judicial
code,
the
word
residence
was
taken
to
mean
with
regard
to
corporate
entities
the
state
of
incorporation.
in
the
overall
revision
of
the
judicial
code
in
that
year
which
expounded
the
term
it
was
given
in
effect
meaning
to
apply
to
any
jurisdiction
to
any
district
in
which
the
respondent
did
business.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
correct.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
correct.
that's
why
i
mentioned
–
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
1948
statute
is
the
general
judicial
code
1391
(c)
which
does
provide
without
question
and
unequivocally
that
the
term
residence
for
venue
purposes
shall
be
taken
to
include
any
district
in
which
the
respondent
corporation
is
licensed
to
do
or
is
doing
business.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
right.
that
is
my
proposition.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
now,
this
court
has
had
a
case
to
consider
that
question
with
regard
to
a
somewhat
similar
and
somewhat
different
provision
of
the
judicial
code
itself
dealing
with
patent
litigation
which
also
provides
a
specific
venue
within
which
patent
litigation
may
be
instituted.
as
it
stood
prior
to
1948,
it
provided
for
immediate
purposes
in
any
district
of
which
the
defendant
is
an
inhabitant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
1400
(b)
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
fourco,
fourco
glass.
now
in
the
overall
revision
of
the
judicial
code
they
were
inhabitant
in
the
patent
section
which
changed
to
residence
that
is
the
same
statute
which
provided
in
1391
(c)
that
the
term
residence
for
venue
purposes
should
be
taken
as
meaning
let
us
say
in
an
over
simplification
any
district
in
which
the
corporation
does
business.
so
that
by
the
same
statute
the
word
inhabitant
in
the
patent
section
was
changed
to
residence
and
the
term
residence
and
another
part
of
that
same
statute
was
said
to
mean
such
and
such
for
venue
purposes.
now
this
court
nevertheless
held
in
that
fourco
case
that
the
general
statute
did
not
change
the
special
venue
provision
with
regard
to
patent
cases.
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
court
below,
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
is
expressed
in
its
postulate
and
i
quote,
that
there
is
a
shocking
inconsistency
in
a
rule
of
law
which
permits
a
corporation
to
maintain
the
regular
establishment
–
a
regular
established
place
of
business
in
the
district,
but
allows
the
corporation
to
insist
on
a
trial
of
the
factual
issues
in
the
district
in
which
it
is
incorporated
or
in
which
its
principal
office
is
located.
the
fourth
circuit
has
reached
the
same
conclusion
as
the
fifth
in
a
recent
case
decided
just
two
or
three
months
ago.
in
united
fruit
case
they
reversed
the
district
court
and
they
held
much
to
the
same
of
fact
that
there
would
be
that
that
principle
for
which
i
stand
here
at
the
time
at
this
moment
would
be
obviously
unfair.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
a
matter
for
congress
to
determine
and
not
for
this
court
in
light
of
the
other
factors
involved.
but
i
do
say
that
(a)
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
of
the
jones
act
has
never
been
mentioned,
that
it
has
a
specific
restrictive
effect,
that
in
calling
this
shockingly
unfair
these
courts
forget
that
for
30
years
that
was
an
unchallenged
rule
laid
down
by
the
congress
as
a
result
of
this
legislative
history,
it
couldn't
have
been
so
shockingly
unfair
and
that
in
the
fourco
case
this
court
held
that
no
changes
in
the
policy
were
to
be
presumed,
then
they
quoted
professor
morris
stating
that
the
–
as
i
read
him
and
this
court
apparently
read
it
the
same
way
that
the
venue
provisions
were
not
intended
special
venue
provisions
as
i
read
it
were
not
intended
to
be
changed
by
the
overall
general
provision
of
the
judicial
code.
in
the
third
circuit,
the
court
has
specifically
followed
the
position
which
we
have
presented
that
is
that
the
fourco
case
compels
a
holding
that
the
general
venue
provision
of
the
1948
code
does
not
supersede
the
special
venue
provision
of
the
jones
act.
and
we
simply
submit,
and
may
it
please
the
court
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
congress
to
determine
with
regards
to
the
questions
of
say
forum
shopping
or
others
because
in
modern
times
briefly
this
does
not
apply
simply
to
two
or
three
court
jurisdictions
in
which
matters
of
this
sort
can
come
up.
the
pure
oil
company,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
so
far
as
i
know
certainly
for
practical
purposes
could
be
sued
in
any
state
of
the
union
and
if
the
plaintiff
in
the
jones
act
case
saw
fit
under
this
broad
construction
he
could
go
and
cue
them
in
nebraska
if
he
thought
he
could
do
better
there
than
in
florida,
new
york
or
elsewhere.
this
is
not
–
and
that
is
true
i
would
say
if
all
of
–
let's
say
of
all
of
the
oil
companies
of
the
tanker
companies
and
so
on.
and
as
mr.
justice
fortas
wrote
in
the
brumley
and
united
steel
workers
case,
the
proper
forum
to
which
in
our
submission
to
submit
a
matter
of
this
sort
is
the
congress
and
not
this
court.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
if
the
court
remains
in
session
a
few
minutes
longer
i
would
be
particularly
brief.
i
daren't
remain
in
my
seat
and
hear
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
important
in
the
shipping
business.
the
port
of
new
orleans
is
in
effect
the
greatest
port
in
the
united
states,
the
largest
steamship
company
in
the
world
has
its
domicile
as
do
a
number
of
great
many
others
and
i
don't
want
to
be
chastised
by
my
chamber
of
commerce
when
i
return
home
for
not
having
met
that
particular
challenge.
i
do
want
to
say
mr.
justice
black
so
that
there
will
be
no
misunderstanding.
we
did
not
move
to
dismiss
this
case.
we
merely
moved
to
transfer
not
to
take
any
the
statute
permits
a
dismissal.
we
did
not
even
moved
for
dismiss,
we
merely
suggested
transfer.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
to
the
principal
place
of
business
of
the
corporation.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it's
palatine,
illinois
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
strictly
under
the
statute.
this
would
merely
transfer
under
1404
this
is
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
under
the
statute.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
not
at
all
that
question
didn't
arise.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
as
long
as
the
congress
sits,
not
as
this
court
said,
as
long
congress
sits
there
will
be
questions
which
will
bother
this
court
and
us,
i'm
sure
at
least
that
it
has
been
my
experience
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
forum
non
conveniens
statute.
the
1404
statute
is
itself
restricted
to
permit
transfers
to
jurisdictions
in
which
the
action
might
have
been
brought
for
instance.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
wouldn't
help
him
in
this
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
as
plaintiff
he
could
seek
to
move
to
any
jurisdiction
he
saw
fit,
that
is
within
the
scope
of
that
statute.
i
don't
know
but
if
you
all
remember
i
do
–
i
presented
right
here
before
you
the
series
of
three
or
four
cases
under
the
forum
non
conveniens
statute
one
of
them
was
one
in
which
the
plaintiff
has
sought
transfer
under
the
statute
and
had
been
successful.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
sorry.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
could
not
transfer
them
to
1404.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
want
to
mention
very
briefly
as
long
as
barron
&
holtzoff
have
been
brought
up
as
not,
if
i
understand
it,
as
making
the
distinction
that
only
the
patent
cases
should
be
involved.
this
is
a
photocopy
of
the
page
from
barron
&
holtzoff
i
read
it
in
a
slight
amount
of
difference.
the
supreme
court
after
some
vacillation
has
now
rejected
any
such
reading
for
the
patent
infringement
cases
at
least
and
has
held
at
the
special
granting
statute
is
not
modified
about
the
general
provisions
of
1391
(c).
this
result
appears
desirable
for
all
such
special
venue
statutes.
we
fairly
confine
that
to
the
patent
statutes
at
all,
and
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
substantially
not
quite
the
same
thing.
he
says
that
it's
apparently
the
rule.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
sorry
i
don't
--
i
did
have
it
here
on
separate
page.
what
he
says
was
this
rule
will
undoubtedly
be
applied
to
all
special
venue
statute.
i'm
not
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well
you
will
find
it
quoted
in
fourco.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it
says
that
we
did
not
intend
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
change
at
these
special
venue
provisions
by
this
general
provision
in
1391
(c)
and
this
court
quoted
into
that
effect
as
the
consultant
who
certainly
should
be
in
authority
on
this
point.
now
i
think
you
start
reading
all
the
different
editions,
lose
leafs
of
moore,
you
can
get
almost
any
idea
you
want
depending
on
what
the
phase
of
the
matter
he
is
attacking
and
i
don't
pretend
to
quote
him
as
completely
authorized
and
all
among
because
i
at
least
want
to
be
consistent.
but
he
does
do
that
and
i
want
to
mention
this
one
further
fact
very
briefly
and
that
is
we
have
many
of
the
special
venue
statutes.
they're
under
the
antitrust
law.
they're
not
in
the
judicial
code.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
suits
against
the
united
states
involving
certain
matters
and
so
on
and
so
on.
in
each
one
of
those
cases
now
fourco
has
been
followed
to
the
effect
that
the
general
statute
1391
(c)
does
not
affect
the
special
venue
statute
and
each
of
those
cases
and
all
the
lower
court
cases
some
certain
point.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
that
is
the
effect
of
it
sir.
i'm
--
i
don't
like
to
indulge
in
dicta.
i'd
like
to
stick
to
my
own
case
if
i
may.
but
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
trying
to
avoid
it
frankly
sir.
but
insofar
as
it
is
necessary
and
i
will
be
completely
frank,
i
think
that
each
of
those
special
venue
statute
should
be
treated
as
on
its
own
bottom
without
reference
to
the
general
statute
which
applies
principally
in
diversity
action.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
was
an
action
instituted
by
a
seaman
who
was
a
resident
of
the
northern
district
of
florida
against
the
petitioner
here,
the
respondent
below,
pure
oil
company
instituted
under
the
jones
act
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
in
which
the
petitioner,
pure
oil
company
does
business.
it
is
however
an
ohio
corporation
with
its
principal
office
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
at
this
point
i
should
like
briefly
to
trace
a
phase
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
jones
act
which
strangely
has
never
been
discussed
in
any
of
the
decisions
in
this
or
any
other
cases
involving
anything
in
the
nature
of
the
issue
here
presented.
it
has
been
stated
frequently
that
the
purpose
of
the
jones
act
was
to
expand
the
rights
of
seamen
and
i
think
that
is
true
except
in
the
point
here
at
issue
on
which
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
it
was
expressly
and
clearly
intended
to
restrict
the
venue
of
seaman’s
actions
under
the
jones
act.
that
the
statute
in
the
course
of
its
enactment
was
part
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1920
and
the
jones
act
itself
was
the
creature
of
senator
wesley
jones
of
the
state
of
washington
who
proposed
it
to
give
seamen
the
right
of
action
for
negligent,
the
sort
of
common
law
right
of
action
in
federal
and
state
courts
to
be
governed,
as
it
came
out
originally,
by
the
provisions
of
a
federal
employers
liability
act.
the
house
objected
to
that
latter
provision
insofar
as
venue
was
concerned
because
the
federal
employers
liability
act
provides
for
venue
in
any
jurisdiction
in
which
the
respondent
is
doing
business.
after
three
or
in
the
course
of
three-senate
house
conferences
the
position
of
the
house
of
representatives
was
to
accepted
for
the
senate
conferees
and
the
statute
was
enacted
to
provide
that
only
the
court
of
the
residence
or
of
the
principal
office
of
the
respondent
should
have
jurisdiction
as
it
is
called
and
now
that
has
been
held
to
mean
venue.
i
repeat
that
that
restrictive
provision
in
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
regarding
that,
has
never
been
mentioned
by
any
court
so
far
as
i
know
in
this
or
in
any
of
the
other
cases
and
there
have
been
several,
three
at
least,
involving
the
precise
point
at
issue
here.
it
was
discussed.
it
was
put
in
the
briefs.
it
was
put
in
application
for
rehearing
in
the
court
below
in
this
case.
it
was
argued.
it
was
presented
and
the
matter
was
not
mentioned.
now
until
1948
with
the
revision,
general
revision
of
the
judicial
code,
the
word
residence
was
taken
to
mean
with
regard
to
corporate
entities
the
state
of
incorporation.
in
the
overall
revision
of
the
judicial
code
in
that
year
which
expounded
the
term
it
was
given
in
effect
meaning
to
apply
to
any
jurisdiction
to
any
district
in
which
the
respondent
did
business.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
correct.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
correct.
that's
why
i
mentioned
–
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
1948
statute
is
the
general
judicial
code
1391
(c)
which
does
provide
without
question
and
unequivocally
that
the
term
residence
for
venue
purposes
shall
be
taken
to
include
any
district
in
which
the
respondent
corporation
is
licensed
to
do
or
is
doing
business.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
right.
that
is
my
proposition.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
now,
this
court
has
had
a
case
to
consider
that
question
with
regard
to
a
somewhat
similar
and
somewhat
different
provision
of
the
judicial
code
itself
dealing
with
patent
litigation
which
also
provides
a
specific
venue
within
which
patent
litigation
may
be
instituted.
as
it
stood
prior
to
1948,
it
provided
for
immediate
purposes
in
any
district
of
which
the
defendant
is
an
inhabitant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
1400
(b)
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
fourco,
fourco
glass.
now
in
the
overall
revision
of
the
judicial
code
they
were
inhabitant
in
the
patent
section
which
changed
to
residence
that
is
the
same
statute
which
provided
in
1391
(c)
that
the
term
residence
for
venue
purposes
should
be
taken
as
meaning
let
us
say
in
an
over
simplification
any
district
in
which
the
corporation
does
business.
so
that
by
the
same
statute
the
word
inhabitant
in
the
patent
section
was
changed
to
residence
and
the
term
residence
and
another
part
of
that
same
statute
was
said
to
mean
such
and
such
for
venue
purposes.
now
this
court
nevertheless
held
in
that
fourco
case
that
the
general
statute
did
not
change
the
special
venue
provision
with
regard
to
patent
cases.
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
court
below,
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
is
expressed
in
its
postulate
and
i
quote,
that
there
is
a
shocking
inconsistency
in
a
rule
of
law
which
permits
a
corporation
to
maintain
the
regular
establishment
–
a
regular
established
place
of
business
in
the
district,
but
allows
the
corporation
to
insist
on
a
trial
of
the
factual
issues
in
the
district
in
which
it
is
incorporated
or
in
which
its
principal
office
is
located.
the
fourth
circuit
has
reached
the
same
conclusion
as
the
fifth
in
a
recent
case
decided
just
two
or
three
months
ago.
in
united
fruit
case
they
reversed
the
district
court
and
they
held
much
to
the
same
of
fact
that
there
would
be
that
that
principle
for
which
i
stand
here
at
the
time
at
this
moment
would
be
obviously
unfair.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
a
matter
for
congress
to
determine
and
not
for
this
court
in
light
of
the
other
factors
involved.
but
i
do
say
that
(a)
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
of
the
jones
act
has
never
been
mentioned,
that
it
has
a
specific
restrictive
effect,
that
in
calling
this
shockingly
unfair
these
courts
forget
that
for
30
years
that
was
an
unchallenged
rule
laid
down
by
the
congress
as
a
result
of
this
legislative
history,
it
couldn't
have
been
so
shockingly
unfair
and
that
in
the
fourco
case
this
court
held
that
no
changes
in
the
policy
were
to
be
presumed,
then
they
quoted
professor
morris
stating
that
the
–
as
i
read
him
and
this
court
apparently
read
it
the
same
way
that
the
venue
provisions
were
not
intended
special
venue
provisions
as
i
read
it
were
not
intended
to
be
changed
by
the
overall
general
provision
of
the
judicial
code.
in
the
third
circuit,
the
court
has
specifically
followed
the
position
which
we
have
presented
that
is
that
the
fourco
case
compels
a
holding
that
the
general
venue
provision
of
the
1948
code
does
not
supersede
the
special
venue
provision
of
the
jones
act.
and
we
simply
submit,
and
may
it
please
the
court
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
congress
to
determine
with
regards
to
the
questions
of
say
forum
shopping
or
others
because
in
modern
times
briefly
this
does
not
apply
simply
to
two
or
three
court
jurisdictions
in
which
matters
of
this
sort
can
come
up.
the
pure
oil
company,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
so
far
as
i
know
certainly
for
practical
purposes
could
be
sued
in
any
state
of
the
union
and
if
the
plaintiff
in
the
jones
act
case
saw
fit
under
this
broad
construction
he
could
go
and
cue
them
in
nebraska
if
he
thought
he
could
do
better
there
than
in
florida,
new
york
or
elsewhere.
this
is
not
–
and
that
is
true
i
would
say
if
all
of
–
let's
say
of
all
of
the
oil
companies
of
the
tanker
companies
and
so
on.
and
as
mr.
justice
fortas
wrote
in
the
brumley
and
united
steel
workers
case,
the
proper
forum
to
which
in
our
submission
to
submit
a
matter
of
this
sort
is
the
congress
and
not
this
court.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
if
the
court
remains
in
session
a
few
minutes
longer
i
would
be
particularly
brief.
i
daren't
remain
in
my
seat
and
hear
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
important
in
the
shipping
business.
the
port
of
new
orleans
is
in
effect
the
greatest
port
in
the
united
states,
the
largest
steamship
company
in
the
world
has
its
domicile
as
do
a
number
of
great
many
others
and
i
don't
want
to
be
chastised
by
my
chamber
of
commerce
when
i
return
home
for
not
having
met
that
particular
challenge.
i
do
want
to
say
mr.
justice
black
so
that
there
will
be
no
misunderstanding.
we
did
not
move
to
dismiss
this
case.
we
merely
moved
to
transfer
not
to
take
any
the
statute
permits
a
dismissal.
we
did
not
even
moved
for
dismiss,
we
merely
suggested
transfer.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
to
the
principal
place
of
business
of
the
corporation.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it's
palatine,
illinois
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
strictly
under
the
statute.
this
would
merely
transfer
under
1404
this
is
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
under
the
statute.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
not
at
all
that
question
didn't
arise.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
as
long
as
the
congress
sits,
not
as
this
court
said,
as
long
congress
sits
there
will
be
questions
which
will
bother
this
court
and
us,
i'm
sure
at
least
that
it
has
been
my
experience
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
forum
non
conveniens
statute.
the
1404
statute
is
itself
restricted
to
permit
transfers
to
jurisdictions
in
which
the
action
might
have
been
brought
for
instance.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
wouldn't
help
him
in
this
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
as
plaintiff
he
could
seek
to
move
to
any
jurisdiction
he
saw
fit,
that
is
within
the
scope
of
that
statute.
i
don't
know
but
if
you
all
remember
i
do
–
i
presented
right
here
before
you
the
series
of
three
or
four
cases
under
the
forum
non
conveniens
statute
one
of
them
was
one
in
which
the
plaintiff
has
sought
transfer
under
the
statute
and
had
been
successful.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
sorry.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
could
not
transfer
them
to
1404.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
want
to
mention
very
briefly
as
long
as
barron
&
holtzoff
have
been
brought
up
as
not,
if
i
understand
it,
as
making
the
distinction
that
only
the
patent
cases
should
be
involved.
this
is
a
photocopy
of
the
page
from
barron
&
holtzoff
i
read
it
in
a
slight
amount
of
difference.
the
supreme
court
after
some
vacillation
has
now
rejected
any
such
reading
for
the
patent
infringement
cases
at
least
and
has
held
at
the
special
granting
statute
is
not
modified
about
the
general
provisions
of
1391
(c).
this
result
appears
desirable
for
all
such
special
venue
statutes.
we
fairly
confine
that
to
the
patent
statutes
at
all,
and
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
substantially
not
quite
the
same
thing.
he
says
that
it's
apparently
the
rule.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
sorry
i
don't
--
i
did
have
it
here
on
separate
page.
what
he
says
was
this
rule
will
undoubtedly
be
applied
to
all
special
venue
statute.
i'm
not
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well
you
will
find
it
quoted
in
fourco.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it
says
that
we
did
not
intend
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
change
at
these
special
venue
provisions
by
this
general
provision
in
1391
(c)
and
this
court
quoted
into
that
effect
as
the
consultant
who
certainly
should
be
in
authority
on
this
point.
now
i
think
you
start
reading
all
the
different
editions,
lose
leafs
of
moore,
you
can
get
almost
any
idea
you
want
depending
on
what
the
phase
of
the
matter
he
is
attacking
and
i
don't
pretend
to
quote
him
as
completely
authorized
and
all
among
because
i
at
least
want
to
be
consistent.
but
he
does
do
that
and
i
want
to
mention
this
one
further
fact
very
briefly
and
that
is
we
have
many
of
the
special
venue
statutes.
they're
under
the
antitrust
law.
they're
not
in
the
judicial
code.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
suits
against
the
united
states
involving
certain
matters
and
so
on
and
so
on.
in
each
one
of
those
cases
now
fourco
has
been
followed
to
the
effect
that
the
general
statute
1391
(c)
does
not
affect
the
special
venue
statute
and
each
of
those
cases
and
all
the
lower
court
cases
some
certain
point.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
that
is
the
effect
of
it
sir.
i'm
--
i
don't
like
to
indulge
in
dicta.
i'd
like
to
stick
to
my
own
case
if
i
may.
but
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i'm
trying
to
avoid
it
frankly
sir.
but
insofar
as
it
is
necessary
and
i
will
be
completely
frank,
i
think
that
each
of
those
special
venue
statute
should
be
treated
as
on
its
own
bottom
without
reference
to
the
general
statute
which
applies
principally
in
diversity
action.
thank
you
your
honor.
