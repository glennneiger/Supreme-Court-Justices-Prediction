mr.
arthur
roth
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
is
basically
a
situation
where
the
defendant
does
not
want
to
be
sued
in
the
most
convenient
form
and
is
now
coming
into
this
court
to
take
a
seamen
away
from
his
residence
which
is
in
florida
place
where
he
was
born,
place
where
he
was
employed,
the
place
where
he
basically
did
his
work
as
this
–
he
worked
on
this
vessel
for
four
years.
the
vessel
traveled
–
he
would
get
on
the
vessel
at
either
tampa
or
port
everglade
which
is
slightly
north
of
miami.
whenever
he
would
come
back
from
vacations
or
leave
of
things
of
that
type,
and
the
vessel
would
fly
between
houston
and
supply
pure
oil
gasoline
in
tampa
or
in
miami
or
jacksonville
and
sometimes
up
to
savannah
and
then
circuit
back
and
this
is
–
mr.
arthur
roth
well
he
could
have
in
state
courts
but
–
mr.
arthur
roth
for
a
civil
and
jury
trial
in
the
federal
courts
i
don't
think
--
mr.
arthur
roth
that's
right,
that's
what
he
would
have
gone
before
1940
--
mr.
arthur
roth
yes,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
congress
had
intended
to
make
a
–
to
facilitate
the
bringing
of
suits
by
plaintiffs
against
large
corporations.
mr.
arthur
roth
sir?
mr.
arthur
roth
in
chicago.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
roth
there's
no
question
about
that
but
the
problem
in
the
state
court
is
basically
one
of
the
discovery
where
we
don't
have
the
privilege
of
taking
a
subpoena
and
sending
it
out
to
a
marshal
in
texas
or
a
marshal
in
savannah
where
the
man
was
treated
for
his
injuries
and
having
a
subpoena
issued
and
this
is
really
the
basic
issue
and
the
second
basic
issue
is
that
the
state
judges
have
–
do
not
have
the
same
understanding
concept
of
the
jones
act
that
seamen
problems
says
to
the
federal
judges
--
mr.
arthur
roth
we
were
asked
that
below
and
i
would
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
black
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
statute
would
be,
i
think
basically,
available
to
a
defendant
rather
than
to
a
plaintiff
because
if
we
were
to
file
a
suit
to
say
in
chicago
and
then
come
in
and
say
to
the
judge
in
chicago
we
want
to
go
down
to
tampa
or
miami
which
is
the
real
forum
where
this
case
should
be
trialed
we
would
somewhat
be
i
mean
how
can
we
ask
the
judge
when
he
says
you
came
here
to
stop
well
this
was
your
election.
and
so
--
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
because
this
was
the
very
purpose
of
1404
where
they
point
that
at
the
fela
was
the
real
reason
that
1404
and
that
is
federal
employees
liability
act
which
is
incorporated
in
the
jones
act
that
1404
revise's
purpose
clause
that
it
was
the
fela
that
made
1404
the
forum
non
conveniens
statute
a
necessity
because
the
railroad
workers
were
bringing
their
cases
in
the
most
profitable
forum
and
the
railroads
couldn't
change
the
forum
and
the
1948
revision
amended
the
venue
of
--
and
in
fact
amended
the
venue,
the
general
venue
provisions
and
permitted
the
transfer
to
a
more
convenient
forum
where
the
witness
would
be
–
mr.
arthur
roth
1948.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
it
is
–
mr.
arthur
roth
1391
and
1948
they
are
both
–
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
of
the
same
revision
of
the
judicial
code.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
sir.
they
were
both
passed
on
june
25th,
1948
i
believe
was
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
or
the
revision
as
i
understood
the
attorney
general's
report
to
the
congress
at
that
time
was
that
it
was
to
reconcile
the
old
laws.
now
in
the
jones
act
it
merely
says
residence
and
we
can
understand
that
in
1920
in
the
give
and
take
when
the
ship
owners
didn't
want
more
liberal
provision
for
seamen
when
they
didn't
want
seamen
to
have
a
better
access
to
the
courts
that
there
had
to
be
some
give
and
take
and
i
can
understand
this
three
conferences
between
the
senate
and
the
house.
but
1948
when
this
court
and
the
other
courts
have
implemented
and
said
that
this
is
remedial
legislation
that
should
be
liberally
construed
so
as
to
afford
a
remedy
to
the
seamen
that
at
that
time
when
the
judicial
code
was
enacted
this
was
a
remedial
legislation
to
liberalize
the
access
of
the
courts
to
plaintiffs.
now
–
mr.
arthur
roth
i
couldn't
find
a
single
case
on
point.
now
in
the
liberalization
of
the
courts
making
it
more
accessible,
readily
available
i
believe
is
the
term
that
the
congress
or
the
revises
of
the
judicial
code
used,
that
at
that
time
i
believe
that
i
don't
read
that
the
congress
at
that
time
meant
to
exclude
seamen
where
as
they
might
give
the
remedy
to
a
–
i'll
put
it
this
way.
they
certainly
meant
to
give
the
remedy
to
the
victim
of
an
automobile
accident
if
a
pure
oil
truck
as
we
say
in
our
brief
were
to
have
an
accident
with
an
automobile
in
miami
there's
no
question
pure
oil
could
be
sued
in
miami
under
the
statute.
now
i
don't
think
that
the
congress
and
the
fifth
circuit
below
and
the
fourth
circuit
both
agreed
on
this
point
that
congress
intended
that
the
seamen
should
have
1924
less
rights
than
those
victims.
now
as
i
understand
that
gist
of
the
–
thrust
of
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
since
the
congress
didn't
mention
the
jones
act
as
intended
to
be
revised
and
consequently
there
should
be
no
revision
of
the
jones
act
venue
intended
by
congress
or
given
by
congress.
well
congress
didn't
mention
any
type
of
lawsuit
in
the
revision
of
1391,
section
1391.
so
to
what
does
the
revision
apply?
certainly
the
statute
was
changed.
congress
certainly
changed
the
common
law
when
it
said,
“from
now
on
the
venue
shall
be
wherever
that
corporation
was
doing
business,”
which
every
district
is
doing
business
in.
certainly
congress
didn't
say
that
well
we
don't
want
to
restrict
it
to
the
jones
act
we
got
to
state
the
jones
act
well
which
that
–
which
actions
did
congress
made,
or
was
the
whole
revision
just
meaningless?
i
don't
think
the
revision
was
meaningless.
mr.
arthur
roth
no
sir,
i
look
through
the
revision
and
i
couldn't
find
in
the
notes
or
the
revises
and
there
is
no
reference
to
anything
specific.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes,
this
is
what
i'm
going
to
come
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
fact
is
that
in
their
petition
the
petitioner
states
that
of
some
3200
jones
act
cases
which
ought
to
be
filed
or
were
filed
in
1965
over
1,000
of
them
or
1/3
of
them
were
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit.
now
the
corporations
don't
do
business
in
the
fifth
circuit.
they
do
their
business
--
i
mean
they
have
their
principal
offices
and
their
incorporating
offices
in
delaware
and
new
york
and
chicago.
they
don't
–
a
very
few
of
the
corporations,
the
big
ship
owners
have
their
principal
place
of
business
in
the
fifth
circuit.
now
certainly
is
it
their
intention
to
deprive
the
seamen
of
their
forum.
now
if
we
were
to
file
a
case
in
a
forum
as
the
petitioner
suggests
let's
say
in
nebraska
certainly
the
1404
(a)
statute
is
available
to
transfer
because
the
very
purposes
i
stated
before
was
the
fela
--
to
get
at
the
fela
cases.
it
revises
notes
indicate
as
to
get
at
the
fela
cases.
mr.
arthur
roth
sir
they
wouldn't
be
filed
in
inconvenient
forms.
and
have
them
transfer
--
so
that
it
can
be
transferred
to
the
more
convenient
forms
where
the
witnesses
are
located.
mr.
arthur
roth
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
roth
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
roth
when
section
1404
was
enacted
in
1948
at
the
same
time
of
the
revision,
the
intent
of
the
congress
was
to
get
at
this
provision
of
the
fela
where
they
could
bring
it
in
any
district
they
wanted
so
that
these
railroads
could
transfer
to
the
more
convenient
forum.
so
that
the
argument
that
is
made
by
the
petitioner
here
that
we
could
bring
our
case
in
los
angeles
or
nebraska
doesn't
bear
weight
because
the
jones
act
and
fela
being
in
effect
one,
indicated,
i
mean
the
congress
indicated
at
that
time
that
they
were
going
to
get
at
the
fela
cases
from
–
so
that
the
plaintiffs
the
injured
railway
worker
wouldn't
be
able
to
bring
it
at
any
forum
he
want,
that
he'd
have
to
come
into
the
more
convenient
forum
at
the
it
is
at
the
petition
of
the
railroad.
when
they
enacted
the
statute
in
1404
at
the
very
--
mr.
arthur
roth
yes.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes.
now
what
section
1404
(a)
the
transfer,
the
venue
transfer
section
was
enacted
the
revises
specifically
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
revision
to
allow
a
transfer
from
the
forum
as
soon
as
it
began
to
a
more
convenient
forum
–
mr.
arthur
roth
no,
they
would
have
to
come
and
make
a
showing
under
the
section
to
say
so
we
have
all
the
witnesses
here
the
man
was
injured
in
this
district,
he
was
treated
in
this
district,
most
of
our
witnesses
live
in
this
district
that
means
when
the
railroad
made
a
proper
showing
--
mr.
arthur
roth
that's
right
and
the
same
thing
of
course
--
mr.
arthur
roth
well
it
was
to
answer
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
that
we
could
bring
a
case
against
pure
oil
company
in
any
district
of
the
country
practically
because
they
are
doing
business
in
any
district
of
the
country
and
–
mr.
arthur
roth
yes,
this
is
--
now
i
would
say
this
that
if
they
can
do
that
with
the
jones
act
case,
this
is
a
change
of
venue
in
a
jones
act
case.
this
is
in
effect
modifying
the
venue
provisions
on
the
jones
act
that
is
and
it
modifies
the
venue
provisions
of
every
statute,
every
venue
statute
because
there
was
no
transfer
of
forum
for
convenience
at
common
law
and
by
the
enactment
and
application
of
the
transfer
statute
this
is
in
effect
a
modification
of
the
common
law
venue.
we
state
at
the
–
mr.
arthur
roth
exactly.
i
think
that
was
the
intention
of
1404.
mr.
arthur
roth
i
think
the
fourco
case
as
all
of
the
tax
writers
have
stated
and
as
the
two
decisions
below
that
is
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
fanning
case
that
came
out
just
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
below,
that
the
fourco
case
applies
solely
to
the
patent
statute
because
of
the
very
peculiar
issues
involved
in
patent
violations
and
patent
trials.
so
i
think
professor
moore
pointed
it
out,
i
believe
barron
&
holtzoff
pointed
out
that
that's
what
it
implies
to
and
the
michigan
law
review
article
which
is
cited
by
both
the
courts
below
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
circuits
point
out
that
even
in
that
and
at
the
fourco
case
is
severely
criticized
because
it
doesn't
take
into
account
the
remedial
purpose
of
the
1948
revision
of
the
judicial
code.
although
i
believe
that
this
court
in
the
fourco
case
pointed
out
that
the
venue
of
provisions
must
be
met
only
by
residence
coupled
with
the
violation
of
the
patent.
i
believe
that
the
reasons
given
by
judge
sobeloff
below
are
most
compelling.
the
opinion
is
quoted
extensively
in
our
brief
and
one
more
point
i
would
like
to
make
i
believe
and
we
urge
that
the
residence,
now
if
the
1948
revision
of
the
code
had
any
purpose,
it
would
be
as
the
court
below
stated
of
course
to
define
what
is
residence?
now
residence
has
a
common
law
definition.
it
means
as
to
corporations.
it
means
as
to
corporation
the
state
where
the
corporation
is
–
where
the
corporation
exists
where
it
has
been
incorporated,
but
the
congress
we
state
came
along
for
venue
of
purposes
congress
has
now
defined
the
term
residence
in
all
venue
statutes.
the
courts
below
have
both
stated
the
same
thing
that
there
is
now
a
definition
of
residence
for
the
purpose
of
venue
that
all
common
law
definitions
must
give
way
to
the
congressional
definition,
statutory
definition
and
we
urge
that
this
court
adapt
that
and
a
firm
on
that
basis
that
there
is
now
a
definition
of
residence
for
venue
purposes
that
the
common
law
cannot
supersede
the
statute,
and
if
congress
once
intended,
if
they
had
once
intended,
something
else
that
that
intention
has
been
overridden
by
the
statute.
i
would
further
say
that
the
argument
that
we
must
petition
congress
for
every
little
wrong,
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
intention
of
the
judicial
code.
the
judicial
code
revision
was
to
take
away
from
congress
all
of
these
petty
little
matters
and
to
leave
it
to
the
courts
to
apply
speedy
and
accessible
remedies
to
plaintiffs.
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
roth
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
is
basically
a
situation
where
the
defendant
does
not
want
to
be
sued
in
the
most
convenient
form
and
is
now
coming
into
this
court
to
take
a
seamen
away
from
his
residence
which
is
in
florida
place
where
he
was
born,
place
where
he
was
employed,
the
place
where
he
basically
did
his
work
as
this
–
he
worked
on
this
vessel
for
four
years.
the
vessel
traveled
–
he
would
get
on
the
vessel
at
either
tampa
or
port
everglade
which
is
slightly
north
of
miami.
whenever
he
would
come
back
from
vacations
or
leave
of
things
of
that
type,
and
the
vessel
would
fly
between
houston
and
supply
pure
oil
gasoline
in
tampa
or
in
miami
or
jacksonville
and
sometimes
up
to
savannah
and
then
circuit
back
and
this
is
–
mr.
arthur
roth
well
he
could
have
in
state
courts
but
–
mr.
arthur
roth
for
a
civil
and
jury
trial
in
the
federal
courts
i
don't
think
--
mr.
arthur
roth
that's
right,
that's
what
he
would
have
gone
before
1940
--
mr.
arthur
roth
yes,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
congress
had
intended
to
make
a
–
to
facilitate
the
bringing
of
suits
by
plaintiffs
against
large
corporations.
mr.
arthur
roth
sir?
mr.
arthur
roth
in
chicago.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
roth
there's
no
question
about
that
but
the
problem
in
the
state
court
is
basically
one
of
the
discovery
where
we
don't
have
the
privilege
of
taking
a
subpoena
and
sending
it
out
to
a
marshal
in
texas
or
a
marshal
in
savannah
where
the
man
was
treated
for
his
injuries
and
having
a
subpoena
issued
and
this
is
really
the
basic
issue
and
the
second
basic
issue
is
that
the
state
judges
have
–
do
not
have
the
same
understanding
concept
of
the
jones
act
that
seamen
problems
says
to
the
federal
judges
--
mr.
arthur
roth
we
were
asked
that
below
and
i
would
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
black
that
the
forum
non
conveniens
statute
would
be,
i
think
basically,
available
to
a
defendant
rather
than
to
a
plaintiff
because
if
we
were
to
file
a
suit
to
say
in
chicago
and
then
come
in
and
say
to
the
judge
in
chicago
we
want
to
go
down
to
tampa
or
miami
which
is
the
real
forum
where
this
case
should
be
trialed
we
would
somewhat
be
i
mean
how
can
we
ask
the
judge
when
he
says
you
came
here
to
stop
well
this
was
your
election.
and
so
--
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
because
this
was
the
very
purpose
of
1404
where
they
point
that
at
the
fela
was
the
real
reason
that
1404
and
that
is
federal
employees
liability
act
which
is
incorporated
in
the
jones
act
that
1404
revise's
purpose
clause
that
it
was
the
fela
that
made
1404
the
forum
non
conveniens
statute
a
necessity
because
the
railroad
workers
were
bringing
their
cases
in
the
most
profitable
forum
and
the
railroads
couldn't
change
the
forum
and
the
1948
revision
amended
the
venue
of
--
and
in
fact
amended
the
venue,
the
general
venue
provisions
and
permitted
the
transfer
to
a
more
convenient
forum
where
the
witness
would
be
–
mr.
arthur
roth
1948.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
it
is
–
mr.
arthur
roth
1391
and
1948
they
are
both
–
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
of
the
same
revision
of
the
judicial
code.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
sir.
they
were
both
passed
on
june
25th,
1948
i
believe
was
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
or
the
revision
as
i
understood
the
attorney
general's
report
to
the
congress
at
that
time
was
that
it
was
to
reconcile
the
old
laws.
now
in
the
jones
act
it
merely
says
residence
and
we
can
understand
that
in
1920
in
the
give
and
take
when
the
ship
owners
didn't
want
more
liberal
provision
for
seamen
when
they
didn't
want
seamen
to
have
a
better
access
to
the
courts
that
there
had
to
be
some
give
and
take
and
i
can
understand
this
three
conferences
between
the
senate
and
the
house.
but
1948
when
this
court
and
the
other
courts
have
implemented
and
said
that
this
is
remedial
legislation
that
should
be
liberally
construed
so
as
to
afford
a
remedy
to
the
seamen
that
at
that
time
when
the
judicial
code
was
enacted
this
was
a
remedial
legislation
to
liberalize
the
access
of
the
courts
to
plaintiffs.
now
–
mr.
arthur
roth
i
couldn't
find
a
single
case
on
point.
now
in
the
liberalization
of
the
courts
making
it
more
accessible,
readily
available
i
believe
is
the
term
that
the
congress
or
the
revises
of
the
judicial
code
used,
that
at
that
time
i
believe
that
i
don't
read
that
the
congress
at
that
time
meant
to
exclude
seamen
where
as
they
might
give
the
remedy
to
a
–
i'll
put
it
this
way.
they
certainly
meant
to
give
the
remedy
to
the
victim
of
an
automobile
accident
if
a
pure
oil
truck
as
we
say
in
our
brief
were
to
have
an
accident
with
an
automobile
in
miami
there's
no
question
pure
oil
could
be
sued
in
miami
under
the
statute.
now
i
don't
think
that
the
congress
and
the
fifth
circuit
below
and
the
fourth
circuit
both
agreed
on
this
point
that
congress
intended
that
the
seamen
should
have
1924
less
rights
than
those
victims.
now
as
i
understand
that
gist
of
the
–
thrust
of
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
since
the
congress
didn't
mention
the
jones
act
as
intended
to
be
revised
and
consequently
there
should
be
no
revision
of
the
jones
act
venue
intended
by
congress
or
given
by
congress.
well
congress
didn't
mention
any
type
of
lawsuit
in
the
revision
of
1391,
section
1391.
so
to
what
does
the
revision
apply?
certainly
the
statute
was
changed.
congress
certainly
changed
the
common
law
when
it
said,
“from
now
on
the
venue
shall
be
wherever
that
corporation
was
doing
business,”
which
every
district
is
doing
business
in.
certainly
congress
didn't
say
that
well
we
don't
want
to
restrict
it
to
the
jones
act
we
got
to
state
the
jones
act
well
which
that
–
which
actions
did
congress
made,
or
was
the
whole
revision
just
meaningless?
i
don't
think
the
revision
was
meaningless.
mr.
arthur
roth
no
sir,
i
look
through
the
revision
and
i
couldn't
find
in
the
notes
or
the
revises
and
there
is
no
reference
to
anything
specific.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes,
this
is
what
i'm
going
to
come
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
fact
is
that
in
their
petition
the
petitioner
states
that
of
some
3200
jones
act
cases
which
ought
to
be
filed
or
were
filed
in
1965
over
1,000
of
them
or
1/3
of
them
were
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit.
now
the
corporations
don't
do
business
in
the
fifth
circuit.
they
do
their
business
--
i
mean
they
have
their
principal
offices
and
their
incorporating
offices
in
delaware
and
new
york
and
chicago.
they
don't
–
a
very
few
of
the
corporations,
the
big
ship
owners
have
their
principal
place
of
business
in
the
fifth
circuit.
now
certainly
is
it
their
intention
to
deprive
the
seamen
of
their
forum.
now
if
we
were
to
file
a
case
in
a
forum
as
the
petitioner
suggests
let's
say
in
nebraska
certainly
the
1404
(a)
statute
is
available
to
transfer
because
the
very
purposes
i
stated
before
was
the
fela
--
to
get
at
the
fela
cases.
it
revises
notes
indicate
as
to
get
at
the
fela
cases.
mr.
arthur
roth
sir
they
wouldn't
be
filed
in
inconvenient
forms.
and
have
them
transfer
--
so
that
it
can
be
transferred
to
the
more
convenient
forms
where
the
witnesses
are
located.
mr.
arthur
roth
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
roth
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
roth
when
section
1404
was
enacted
in
1948
at
the
same
time
of
the
revision,
the
intent
of
the
congress
was
to
get
at
this
provision
of
the
fela
where
they
could
bring
it
in
any
district
they
wanted
so
that
these
railroads
could
transfer
to
the
more
convenient
forum.
so
that
the
argument
that
is
made
by
the
petitioner
here
that
we
could
bring
our
case
in
los
angeles
or
nebraska
doesn't
bear
weight
because
the
jones
act
and
fela
being
in
effect
one,
indicated,
i
mean
the
congress
indicated
at
that
time
that
they
were
going
to
get
at
the
fela
cases
from
–
so
that
the
plaintiffs
the
injured
railway
worker
wouldn't
be
able
to
bring
it
at
any
forum
he
want,
that
he'd
have
to
come
into
the
more
convenient
forum
at
the
it
is
at
the
petition
of
the
railroad.
when
they
enacted
the
statute
in
1404
at
the
very
--
mr.
arthur
roth
yes.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
roth
yes.
now
what
section
1404
(a)
the
transfer,
the
venue
transfer
section
was
enacted
the
revises
specifically
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
revision
to
allow
a
transfer
from
the
forum
as
soon
as
it
began
to
a
more
convenient
forum
–
mr.
arthur
roth
no,
they
would
have
to
come
and
make
a
showing
under
the
section
to
say
so
we
have
all
the
witnesses
here
the
man
was
injured
in
this
district,
he
was
treated
in
this
district,
most
of
our
witnesses
live
in
this
district
that
means
when
the
railroad
made
a
proper
showing
--
mr.
arthur
roth
that's
right
and
the
same
thing
of
course
--
mr.
arthur
roth
well
it
was
to
answer
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
that
we
could
bring
a
case
against
pure
oil
company
in
any
district
of
the
country
practically
because
they
are
doing
business
in
any
district
of
the
country
and
–
mr.
arthur
roth
yes,
this
is
--
now
i
would
say
this
that
if
they
can
do
that
with
the
jones
act
case,
this
is
a
change
of
venue
in
a
jones
act
case.
this
is
in
effect
modifying
the
venue
provisions
on
the
jones
act
that
is
and
it
modifies
the
venue
provisions
of
every
statute,
every
venue
statute
because
there
was
no
transfer
of
forum
for
convenience
at
common
law
and
by
the
enactment
and
application
of
the
transfer
statute
this
is
in
effect
a
modification
of
the
common
law
venue.
we
state
at
the
–
mr.
arthur
roth
exactly.
i
think
that
was
the
intention
of
1404.
mr.
arthur
roth
i
think
the
fourco
case
as
all
of
the
tax
writers
have
stated
and
as
the
two
decisions
below
that
is
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
fanning
case
that
came
out
just
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
below,
that
the
fourco
case
applies
solely
to
the
patent
statute
because
of
the
very
peculiar
issues
involved
in
patent
violations
and
patent
trials.
so
i
think
professor
moore
pointed
it
out,
i
believe
barron
&
holtzoff
pointed
out
that
that's
what
it
implies
to
and
the
michigan
law
review
article
which
is
cited
by
both
the
courts
below
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
circuits
point
out
that
even
in
that
and
at
the
fourco
case
is
severely
criticized
because
it
doesn't
take
into
account
the
remedial
purpose
of
the
1948
revision
of
the
judicial
code.
although
i
believe
that
this
court
in
the
fourco
case
pointed
out
that
the
venue
of
provisions
must
be
met
only
by
residence
coupled
with
the
violation
of
the
patent.
i
believe
that
the
reasons
given
by
judge
sobeloff
below
are
most
compelling.
the
opinion
is
quoted
extensively
in
our
brief
and
one
more
point
i
would
like
to
make
i
believe
and
we
urge
that
the
residence,
now
if
the
1948
revision
of
the
code
had
any
purpose,
it
would
be
as
the
court
below
stated
of
course
to
define
what
is
residence?
now
residence
has
a
common
law
definition.
it
means
as
to
corporations.
it
means
as
to
corporation
the
state
where
the
corporation
is
–
where
the
corporation
exists
where
it
has
been
incorporated,
but
the
congress
we
state
came
along
for
venue
of
purposes
congress
has
now
defined
the
term
residence
in
all
venue
statutes.
the
courts
below
have
both
stated
the
same
thing
that
there
is
now
a
definition
of
residence
for
the
purpose
of
venue
that
all
common
law
definitions
must
give
way
to
the
congressional
definition,
statutory
definition
and
we
urge
that
this
court
adapt
that
and
a
firm
on
that
basis
that
there
is
now
a
definition
of
residence
for
venue
purposes
that
the
common
law
cannot
supersede
the
statute,
and
if
congress
once
intended,
if
they
had
once
intended,
something
else
that
that
intention
has
been
overridden
by
the
statute.
i
would
further
say
that
the
argument
that
we
must
petition
congress
for
every
little
wrong,
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
intention
of
the
judicial
code.
the
judicial
code
revision
was
to
take
away
from
congress
all
of
these
petty
little
matters
and
to
leave
it
to
the
courts
to
apply
speedy
and
accessible
remedies
to
plaintiffs.
thank
you.
