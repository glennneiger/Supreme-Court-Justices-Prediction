justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
you
referred,
it
applied
to
[inaudible]
that
would
put
it
on
the
same
basis
as
fela's,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
you
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
1948
statute
is
more
a
general
application,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
proposition
is
going
to
be
not
so
as
the
jones
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
code
you're
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
code
you're
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean
the
fourco
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
fact
is
mr.
roth
that
this
at
all
happened
before
1948
he
could
not
have
sued
it
in
florida,
could
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i
mean
he'd
decide
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
would
have
to
go
either
where
pure
oil
was
incorporated
or
where
it
has
principal
offices.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
the
issue
really
is
not
based
on
how
hard
it
may
be
if
upon
him
to
do
it
but
whether
indeed
the
1948
statute
did
allow
him
to
bring
an
action
further
doesn't
it?
is
that
the
relation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
it
might
have
had
some
special
reference
to
diversity
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it
would
be
very
significant
though
wouldn't
it
if
diversity
cases,
suits
against
the
corporations
that
they
might
be
sued
with
any
–
might
spread
the
work
around
instead
of
concentrating
in
some
district?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
get
at
them
in
what
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
that.
fela
actions
always
as
i
understand
it
could
be
brought
wherever
the
corporation
did
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
jones
act
cases
that
were
limited
to
principal
office
or
state
of
incorporation,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
you
say
what
revise
would
say
about
the
fela
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
follow
this
mr.
roth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
fela
actions
before
1948
to
be
brought
at
any
district
or
the
corporation
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
the
railroad
business,
anyone.
and
at
the
1948
the
revision
contemplated,
what,
that
these
cases
should
be
funneled
into
a
more
convenient
forum?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
a
railroad
could
come
in
the
district
court
the
suit
was
brought
to
say
no,
this
is
not
the
phase
that
should
be
tried,
transfer
it
somewhere
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
you
say
had
to
make
a
showing,
you
say
the
reason
for
1404
is
that
the
number
in
the
1948
act
was
in
the
railroad
to
have
it
transferred
out
of
the
district
court
where
it
was
brought
to
some
other
more
convenient
forum
if
there
was
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
bearing
does
that
have
an
issue
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
if
you
prevail
here
what
will
happen
is
that
the
pure
oil
company
could
do
at
any
railroad
can
do
as
the
fela
suit
namely
transfer
it
to
a
more
convenient
forum,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
i
understand
this
mr.
roth
that
are
you
suggesting
here
that
we
should
agree
that
congress
by
the
1948
provision
permitted
jones
act
cases
to
be
brought
wherever
the
corporate
defendant
did
business
because
the
corporate
defendant's
interest
could
be
protected
by
the
transfer
provisions
under
1404,
is
that
