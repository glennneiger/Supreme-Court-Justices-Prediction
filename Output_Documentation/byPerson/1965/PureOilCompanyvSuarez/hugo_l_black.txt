does

i
assume
he

in

that
the

if

1948?
justice

when
did
this
take

this
statute?
justice

both
in
1948?
justice

were
they
a

justice

same
revision?
justice
hugo

have
there
been
any
cases
that
plaintiffs
have
filed
in
the
jurisdiction
408
from
the
place
where
it
happened
and
then
plaintiff
asked
to
have
it
moved
to
a
place
where
it's
more
convenient?
justice

transfer
it
to

justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
chicago?
justice

illinois?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
move
to
dismiss
it
on
the
ground
that
the
witnesses
are
there
and
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
trial
on
the
grounds
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
ask
to
move
it
on
the
ground
of
forum
non
conveniens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
that
question
because
it
was
rather
my
impression
that
the
congress
took
a
new
look
at
all
of
these
thing
on
forum
non
conveniens
and
most
of
these
other
troublesome
questions
were
ended
by
it,
i'd
hoped?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
would
–
it
bothered
me
in
the
respect
that
i
had
an
idea
that
gave
a
new
deal
and
all
that
legislation
1948
and
they
did
not
intend
to
have
a
forum
non
conveniens
statute
affect
this
ploy
by
keeping
old
interpretations
that
no
longer
fitted
the
term.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
he
couldn't
move
it.
he
couldn't
bring
it
up
and
lose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
couldn't
move
it
back
to
miami
under
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
that
they
must
all
be
together?
that
there's
just
one
general
blanket
holding
that
was
intended
to
say
that
without
regard
to
what
purpose
the
statute
was
passed
and
i
have
interpreted
it
all,
you
look
at
this
and
you
say
whether
you
decide
that
fourco
under
this
special
statute
therefore
you're
going
to
decide
it
all
maybe
that's
true,
but
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
thought
you
were
going
outside

was
the
reason
i
asked
--
justice

where
would
the
suit
have
to
be

justice

if
the
