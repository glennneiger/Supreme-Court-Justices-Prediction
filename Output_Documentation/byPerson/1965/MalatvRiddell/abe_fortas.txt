justice
abe
fortas
i
note
that
there
was
a
merely
uncontested
return
with
respect
to
the
--
some
of
these
lots
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
at
the
same
account?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
whatever
--
justice
abe
fortas
whatever
the
purpose
was,
what
is
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice

fortas
and
i
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
--
what
difference
is
there
in
term
--
in
legal
terms?
what
differences
there
in
legal
terms
between
the
status
of
the
profit
on
the
first
transactions
with
respect
to
small
lots
and
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
is
the
difference
in
theory?
we
have
--
this
court
does
not
so
held,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
--
what
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
difference
in
legal
theory,
a
statutory
construction
between
the
first
group
of
transactions
and
the
one
that
you're
presenting
to
us
today?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
saying
that
it
is
just
a
matter
of
size
and
from
that
you
deduce.
justice
abe
fortas
--
intent
or
--
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
so
what
is
the
difference
in
theory
between
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
you're
submitting
to
us?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
all
of
these
tracts,
the
tracts
that
were
involve
in
the
first
group
of
transaction
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
was
in
the
tract
that
is
before
us
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
were
part
of
the
same
deal,
weren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
as
i
understand
it,
you're
--
we
are
here
confronted
with
the
situation
in
which
some
of
the
lots
were
sold
off
and
there
is
no
contest,
i
take
it,
that
the
profit
to
subject
ordinary
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
perhaps
i
can
simplify
it
by
saying
that,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
you
are
not
submitting
to
us
any
circumstances
with
respect
to
ownership
or
intent
of
the
tidiness
that
affected
the
first
group
of
transactions
and
did
not
affect
to
transaction
that
is
before
us
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
take
it
you
way.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
levin,
do
you
take
the
--
on
the
attempt
of
the
taxpayer
as
of
the
time
of
the
sale
or
do
you
take
the
original
intent
even
though
in
last
sentence,
he
used
the
word
â€˜your
burden
the
intent
at
the
time
of
acquisition
is
settled
to
me'.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
total
consideration
that
all
the
transaction
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
including
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
including
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
ones
that
are
clearly
of
a
capital
gains
nature.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
ones
that
are
--
they
rent
only?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
in
the
response
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
no.
no,
i'm
talking
about
this
particular
are
you
describing
business
of
lesser
company
in
generally.
and
i
thought
you
responded
in
my
--
response
to
the
question
by
my
brother
stewart
that
you
take
it
and
you
would
pay
some
attention.
they
could
separate
the
tax
consequences
on
the
basis
of
an
individual
bought
the
property?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
what
i'm
really
asking
is
whether
--
is
there
any
dispute
in
your
mind
as
to
the
major
or
majority
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
trust
of
the
lesser
business.
justice
abe
fortas
in
what
--
in
what
category
does
that
fall?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that
but
do
you
know
how
it
was
treated
by
the
taxpayer?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
there
were
incontestable
finding
that
these
people
are
required
at
all
of
these
property
or
purposes
of
a
development
on
the
rental
basis
and
that
there
came
a
point
of
time
where
for
whatever
reason,
they
subdivided
some
of
it
and
sold
it
all
and
paid
capital
gains,
have
paid
the
tax
on
that
at
ordinary
income
rates.
but
as
to
a
portion
of
the
land,
the
original
intent
carried
through
and
they
held
that,
and
sold
couple
of
large
tracts
of
a
raw
land.
where
would
we
come
out
on
the
tax
analysis
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no.
but
that
you
say
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
i
--
you
don't
want
to
say
--
press
that
to
you
because
that
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
people
who
are
engaged
in
the
general
real
estate
business
as
you
described,
for
example,
the
lesser
properties
here
could
never
get
capital
gain,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
so,
how
do
you
arrive
at
your
result
in
the
present
case?
how
do
you
distinguish
the
present
case
from
the
last
example
that
you
put?
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
the
crucial
factors?
