stewart
the
taxpayer
could
never
win
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
of
course
the
statute
doesn't
quite
describe
the
definition
that
you
as
said.
it's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
properties
held
primarily
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
the
sale
to
customers.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
narrowed
down
really,
doesn't
it
or
am
i
mistaken
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
‘primarily'
in
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
and
you
must
under
the
statute,
mustn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
levin,
we
are
not
here
really
to
weigh
the
evidence
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whether
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
applied
the
correct
test
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
statute
and
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
‘primary'
meant
--
‘primarily'
meant
to
a
‘substantially'
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
is
said
that
primary
--
‘primarily'
means
‘predominantly'
and
so
and
then
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
of
taking
kind
of
a
middle
course.
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
eighth
circuit
has
said
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
primarily?
