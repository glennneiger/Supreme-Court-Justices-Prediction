mr.
jack
s.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
put
the
factual
question
which
petitioner
has
argued
in
its
proper
legal
context.
the
statute
which
we
are
here
concerned
with
is
section
1221
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
which
is
printed
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
now,
the
statute
in
general
strokes
sets
up
assistant
whereby
a
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
report
as
capital
gain,
sales
of
property
where
that
property
fits
within
certain
categories
and
one
of
the
excluded
categories
from
capital
gain,
is
property
held
by
the
taxpayer
primarily
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
previous
decisions
including
the
corn
products
case,
the
general
intent
of
congress
was
to
tax
as
ordinary
income
the
everyday
profits
of
a
business,
but
to
give
capital
gain
on
passive
long
term
accretions
in
value
and
it
has
a
--
of
course
no
little
problem
in
distinguishing
between
the
two
types
of
profits.
those
from
a
business
on
the
one
hand
and
those
from
passive
or
long
term
accretions
in
value
on
the
other,
many
cases
for
somewhere
in
the
middle.
the
traditional
touchstone
is
been
one
of
asking
whether
the
taxpayer
was
in
business,
whether
the
taxpayer
was
in
business
has
frequently
been
--
almost
always
been
left
to
the
trier
of
fact
as
a
factual
question
with
proper
instructions
from
the
judge.
the
courts
have
enunciated
a
number
of
factors
bearing
upon
whether
a
person
is
in
business.
these
factors
have
been
included
the
number
of
transactions
into
which
he
enters,
the
continuity
of
the
transactions,
the
size
and
extent
of
the
transactions.
the
--
activities
in
which
he
engage.
where
a
taxpayer
was
engaged
in
enough
activity
then
he
was
in
business
and
if
he
brought
a
piece
of
real
estate
and
he
was
an
attorney
who
were
never
engaged
in
real
estate
transactions
before
and
held
this
one
piece
real
estate
and
sold
it
20
years
later,
he
got
capital
gain
on
that
sale.
if,
however,
his
activities
in
the
real
estate
business
were
sufficiently
substantial,
so
that
the
trier
of
fact
could,
under
proper
legal
standards,
find
that
he
was
in
the
trade
of
business
then
he
got
ordinary
income.
and
the
question
of
whether
you
are
in
a
business
and
whether
the
particular
property
on
which
the
gain
was
realized
was
held
for
sale
in
the
course
of
that
business
are
typically
factual
type
questions.
now,
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
that
there
is
--
there
are
here
two
questions.
one
is
the
factual
question.
that
is,
“were
there
people
in
a
business,
did
they
hold
this
property
for
sale
in
the
business?
and
what
were
their
intentions?”
those
are
things
in
which
we
have
the
findings
of
two
lower
courts
and
we
have
a
great
amount
testimony.
i
will
be
happy
to
detail
that
testimony.
i
think
it
supports
our
position.
the
second
question
and
the
one
i
--
i
assume
this
court
granted
certiorari
to,
to
resolve
if
possible,
is
the
legal
question
as
to
what
the
phrase
‘property
held
by
the
taxpayer
primarily
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
this
trade
of
business'
means.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
--
that's
right.
this
--
this
court
has
frequently
recognized
that
the
capital
gain
statute
is
perhaps
not
the
most
articulately
worded
statute
and
it
has
--
it
has
recognized
that
in
many
instances
its
got
to
interpret
it
with
the
intension
of
congress
in
mind.
now,
here
the
dispute
in
a
number
of
case
coming
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
we
have
approximately
six
courts
of
appeals,
five
courts
of
appeals
i
think
in
court
of
claims
ruling
on
this
question.
that
the
legal
question
which
we
put
forth
in
our
brief,
is
whether
a
taxpayer,
who
is
in
the
regular
business
of
both
selling
and
renting
the
same
type
of
assets,
whether
that
that
be
real
estate
that
he
said
--
he
buys
it
and
then
either
sells
or
rent
it,
whether
it
be
computers
that
they
manufacture
or
buy
and
then
and
sell
or
rent
or
water
coolers
or
recording
equipment.
the
cases
are
concern
items
of
this
nature.
when
the
taxpayer
acquires
an
asset
which
he
intends
either
to
rent
or
to
sell
and
one
can
say
that
majority
of
his
income
is
derived
from
rental.
and
only
the
minority
from
the
sale,
say,
he
sells
70%,
he
rents
70%
of
the
--
of
the
computers
or
real
estate
and
he
only
sales
30%
of
it
in
the
normal
course
of
his
business.
the
court
has
found
this
to
be
--
assuming
the
court
has
found
this
to
be
a
business
that
he's
on
a
business
both
selling
and
renting,
can
you
say
that
taxpayer
has
held
the
property
primarily
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
this
business?
the
taxpayers
have
contended
that
‘primarily'
means
‘chief'
or
‘first'
or
‘primary'
and
that
you've
got
to
look
the
chief
motive
which
they
had
and
if
they
acquired
it
with
a
--
with
the
motive
in
mind
to
rent
if
possible
or
with
the
thought
in
mind
that
they
acquire
70%
of
their
income
from
the
rental,
then
they
say
their
chief
motive
was
rental.
and
their
motive
of
selling
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
was
a
subsidiary
or
secondary
motive.
it
is
our
position
that
the
word
‘primary'
here
is
broader
than
that.
it
doesn't
mean
solely
the
chief
motive.
this
court
had
a
case
before
it
board
of
governors
versus
agnew
a
few
years
back
in
which
the
exact
same
word
was
involved,
the
word
‘primarily'.
there
the
question
is
whether
someone
was
primarily
engaged
in
the
underwriting
business
when
that
was
only
30%
of
their
income
and
they
get
70%
of
their
income
from
acting
as
broker
and
dealer,
etcetera.
and
there
the
court
said
that
where
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
the
context
in
which
congress
used
the
word
‘primarily',
they're
primarily
engaged
in
underwriting
was
such
that
it
would
be
more
logical
in
order
to
accomplish
the
end
sought,
the
evils
to
be
remedied,
etcetera.
the
word
‘primarily'
could
be
interpreted
as
meaning
‘essential'
or
‘substantial'.
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
legislative
of
history
and
the
clear
intent
of
the
capital
gains
statute
were
to
catch
up
as
ordinary
income
whether
it
be
with
this
phrase
or
some
order
phrase,
we
think
this
is
been
being
the
most
apt
phrase
in
the
exceptions
to
capital
gain.
all
the
everyday
profits
of
the
business
enterprise,
so
that
if
you're
in
the
business
of
acquiring
land,
computers,
water
coolers
or
what
have
you
for
either
rental
or
sale,
that
your
sales
in
the
normal
course
of
business
must
produce
ordinary
income
and
if
necessary
this
court
will
interpret
the
word
‘primarily'
as
having
the
broader
scope
that
it
had
in
the
agnew
case.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
absolutely.
no
question
about
it.
if
the
man
acquired
this
particular
piece
of
property
and
he
said,
“all
i'm
going
to
do
is
rent
this
out.
i
have
no
intention
to
sell
it,”
and
the
court
find
that
that
in
truth
was
his
intent,
well
then,
his
entitle
to
capital
gain.
and
the
same
thing
is
through
here,
these
taxpayers
did
not
vigorously
contend,
not
too
vigorous
contend
that
they
weren't
really
in
the
business
of
selling,
their
major
contention
was
this
piece
of
property
was
not
acquired
for
the
purpose
of
selling
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
it
is
our
position
which
i
--
i
will
now
attempt
to
demonstrate
from
the
record
that
the
lower
court
found
and
the
records
supports
the
findings
that
this
taxpayer,
these
taxpayers,
the
joint
ventured
by
taxpayers
acquired
this
45-acre
piece
of
property
with
the
intention
either
to
build
on
it
and
then
rent
it
out
or
to
sell
it
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
either
by
individual
lots
or
in
larger
chunks
or
in
some
combination
of
it
whichever
was
more
profitable.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
your
honor
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
this
is
--
this
is
not
an
easy
question.
the
statute
says,
“the
purpose
for
which
it
was
held
by
the
taxpayer.”
mr.
jack
s.
levin
we
do
not
think
that
the
purpose
for
which
was
acquired
is
determinative
nor
do
we
think
that
the
purpose
for
which
was
sold
is
solely
determinative.
we
do
not
go
so
far,
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals
go
so
far
as
petitioner
pointed
out.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
person
sold
the
piece
property
indicates
that
he
held
that
for
the
purpose
of
sale
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
to
customers.
no.
we
don't
go
nearly
that
far.
if
--
if
a
taxpayer
acquires
a
piece
of
property
with
the
intention
solely
to
rent
it
out
and
then
at
some
point
his
intent
changes
and
he
has
a
great
deal
of
activity.
let
say,
he
acquires
a
hundred-acre
piece
of
property
with
the
intent
just
to
rent
it
out.
but
then
he
realizes
that
it
would
be
much
better
to
break
it
up
into
500
lots
and
he
puts
in
streets
and
sewers
and
so
forth
he
goes
--
he
goes
to
a
lot
of
activity.
he
hires
a
hundred
salesmen,
sends
them
out,
and
goes
full
scale
in
a
business.
his
intent
has
changed.
his
purpose
for
holding
the
property
has
changed.
he
gets
ordinary
income.
you
can
change
your
purpose.
however,
the
purpose
for
which
you
acquire
piece
of
property
is
relevant
whether
there
is
no
evidence
of
change.
here,
we
contend
that
the
taxpayer's
original
purpose
of
acquisition
and
his
purpose
during
the
entire
nine-month
period
that
he
held
the
property
was
to
explore
all
the
ways
in
which
he
could
profit
from
it.
including
building
shopping
centers,
building
apartment
buildings,
subdividing
a
part
of
it,
selling
part
of
it
in
10-acre
lots.
doing
whatever
he
could
to
profit
from
it.
we
think
that
the
first
instance
which
tends
to
show
that
and
which
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
order
to
put
this
in
its
context
is
that
of
the
five
venturers
who
formed
this
joint
venture
and
acquired
the
45-acre
parcel,
three
were
engaged
in
the
real
estate
business
full
time.
petitioner,
who
was
a
member
of
the
joint
venture
only
and
that
he
represented
louis
lesser
enterprises
a
partnership.
louis
lesser
enterprises,
it
was
one-fifth
owner
of
this
venture
and
petitioner
was
a
general
partner
in
louis
lesser
enterprises.
louis
lesser
enterprises
which
had
been
formed
five
years
before
had
during
its
five-year
existence,
engaged
in
the
construction
and
rental
of
approximately
300
duplex
apartment
buildings
and
homes.
it
had
engaged
in
building
and
managing
of
two
shopping
center
projects
and
the
rental
of
an
office
building.
it
had
engaged
in
seven
venturers,
at
least
seven
venturers
the
record
shows,
where
land
was
acquired
and
subdivided
for
sale
and
all
of
those
profits
reported
as
ordinary
income
apparently
that
they
were
in
a
business.
and
it
is
engaged
in
at
least
five
or
perhaps
eight
sales
of
raw
land
in
bulk
and
bigger
than
individual
lot
sizes,
for
a
total
consideration
of
at
least
a
$1,300,000.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
if
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
we
--
we
do
not
concede
that
any
of
the
transactions
were
clearly
of
a
capital
gains
nature.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
any
of
these
particular
transactions
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
you
could.
it
depend
on
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
oh,
yes.
you
must.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
we
agree,
you
must.
i
--
but
--
i
thought
your
question
was
more
directed
to
whether
some
of
these
sales
were
entitled
to
capital
gain
treatment.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well
--
what
i'm
tempting
to
demonstrate
here
is
that
as
regular
part
of
their
business
they
engaged
in
all
facets
of
the
real
estate
transactions.
including
purchasing
land
to
build
on,
shopping
centers,
duplex-apartment
buildings,
shopping
centers
to
subdivide,
to
sell
by
lots
or
to
sell
in
large
blocks,
and
i'm
pointing
out
to
all
the
transactions
which
they
engage
in
which
form
the
context
in
which
the
district
court
reached
its
conclusion.
there
was
testimony
on
at
least
two
of
these
eight
sales
of
real
estate,
that
the
taxpayers
said,
“oh,
well
this
one
was
a
sale
for
$621,000”.
the
taxpayer
said,
“oh
well
this
was
the
hundred
acres
left
over
after
we
finish
setting
up
the
subdivision.”
and
i
think
it
--
it's
not
worthy
to
that
piece
of
property
held
eight
months,
so
in
eight
months
the
acquired
piece
of
property
apparently
they
could
subdivide
a
part.
and
eight
months
later
sold
the
hundred
acres
for
$621,000
yielding
a
profit
a
$25,000.
what
i'm
pointing
out
is
course
of
conduct.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
since
this
case
did
not
concern
that
piece
of
property
with
an
earlier
year,
apparently
the
statute
of
limitations
run.
that's
not
here
in
question.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
the
taxpayer
reported
capital
gain
on
a
number
these
transactions
including
this
one.
a
deficiency
notice
was
served
upon
the
taxpayer
and
setting
forth
the
proposition
that
all
of
these
sales
of
the
real
estate
including
the
one
we
are
now
talking
about
which
is
called
the
buena
park
real
estate
that
the
proper
--
that
$125,000
profit
and
all
the
other
profits
were
ordinary
income
on
the
ground
that
they
were
engaged
in
the
real
estate
business.
taxpayer
then
paid
the
entire
deficiency
which
included
the
deficiency
now
in
question
that
is
on
the
century
crenshaw
land
and
all
the
other
pieces
of
real
estate.
he's
filed
for
a
refund
only
on
this
one
piece
of
property,
thus,
he
has
paid
in
the
ordinary
income
tax
on
the
other
pieces.
i
don't
know
if
by
that
--
i
don't
by
that
contend
that
he
has
conceded
anything
in
discussions
of
that
counsel.
he
assumes,
he
doesn't
concede
that
that
was
right
but
they
did
pay
that
deficiency,
did
not
sue
for
refund
of
that
portion.
so
while
they
originally
paid
capital
gains
tax
on
it,
they
later
made
up
the
rest
of
the
tax
and
have
paid
ordinary
income
tax
and
not
sued
for
refund
the
statute
now
having
run.
in
addition
to
lesser
enterprises
which
i
believe
this
is
clearly
in
all
faces
of
the
real
estate
business.
two
of
the
other
venturers
were
man
named
hicks.
mr.
hicks
was
the
record
shows
a
real
estate
broker
and
mr.
fenmore.
the
record
shows
that
mr.
fenmore
was
engaged
principally
in
the
real
estate
business
and
that
had
--
he
had
been
engaged
in
the
real
estate
business
for
20
years
according
to
his
own
testimony.
the
other
two
joint
venturers
were
not
full
time
in
the
real
estate
business
so
far
as
the
record
discloses,
although,
one
was
looking
full
time
for
a
real
estate
deals
whatever
that
means.
now,
i
point
this
out
as
the
context
in
which
the
district
court
got
this
case.
here
what
three
people,
that
is
petitioner
in
behalf
of
lesser
enterprises,
hicks
and
fenmore.
three
of
the
five
joint
venturers,
who
were
in
the
real
estate
business,
who
were
in
the
habit
of
handling
property,
acquiring
it
in
logic,
in
common
sense
shows
that
they
acquired
property
for
whatever
purpose
they
could
make
a
profit
on
it.
if
they
could
build
on
it,
they
did
so.
if
they
couldn't
get
financing
they
subdivided
it,
if
it
look
more
probably
sold
in
bulk.
now
turning
to
this
piece
of
property,
what
were
their
intentions
with
regard
to
this
piece
of
property?
the
petitioner
testified
that
it
was
located
in
a
fast
growing
area.
and
that
the
--
they
had
made
a
good
buy
as
far
as
price
was
concerned.
he
also
testified
that
they
hope
to
build
an
apartment
development
on
the
entire
45-acres
but
when
they
purchased
the
property,
before
they
purchased
the
property,
they
knew
that
the
mortgage
market
was
rough
because
they
were
trying
to
get
financing
for
other
similar
deals.
as
it
turned
out
they
were
unnable
to
get
financing.
the
mortgage
market
remained
rough.
they
also
had
hopes
of
getting
commercial
zoning
on
the
two
frontage
parcels,
the
two
10-acred
parcels
which
are
here
in
question.they
never
did
get
commercial
zoning
on
it.
in
fact,
what
happened
is
they
acquired
the
property,
within
two
months
being
unable
to
get
financing.
they
began
subdividing
the
interior
25-acres.
they
subdivided
it
into
105
parcels
and
within
nine
months
after
acquisition
it
sold
the
entire
105
parcels
reporting
the
income
as
the
capital
gain.
that
is
ordinary
income.
excuse
me,
that
is
ordinary
income.
during
this
period,
they
had
received
the
number
of
fillers,
the
word
‘fillers'
is
used
in
the
record,
with
regard
to
the
two,
10-acre
frontages.
that
is
the
frontage
on
the
century
boulevard
and
the
frontage
on
crenshaw
boulevard
that
they
had
not
subdivided.
within
nine
months
after
the
acquisition
of
property,
they
in
fact
sold
those
two
frontages
making
a
profit
on
a
two
frontages
of
$127,000
which
is
the
profit
here
in
question.
now,
the
testimony
on
their
intention
for
holding
the
property
other
than
it
was
fast
are
and
that
they
made
--
in
a
fast
growing
area
and
they've
made
a
good
buy
as
far
as
price
was
concerned
was
the
following.
counsel
of
the
government
asked,
“did
you
con
--”
asked
the
petitioner
--
“did
you
contemplate
in
acquiring
the
property,
the
possibility
that
rezoning
or
refinancing
or
whatever
might
not
be
possible?”
he
replied,
“this
is
always
a
possibility.
we
felt
that
we
have
made
a
good
buy
in
the
property
as
far
as
price
is
concerned,
so
that
if
we
couldn't
do
anything
in
the
way
zoning,
we
would
sell
the
whole
thing
off
in
bulk.”
he
then
testified
two
pages
later
that,
“the
type
of
mortgage
financing
that
we
would
like
for
apartment
developing
was
not
available.
that
is
financing
that
would
permit
us
to
build
apartments
for
rent
and
get
what
we
felt
was
a
reasonable
return
on
our
equity
investment.”
when
they
found
that
they
could
not
get
a
reasonable
return
on
their
equity
investment
by
building.
they
then
subdivided
the
interior
25
acres,
sold
the
two
10-acre
parcels.
mr.
fenmore,
one
of
the
other
joint
venturers
testified,
“my
own
understanding
of
why
we
sold
it,
why
in
our
case
we
bought
it
was
there
was
a
chance
to
make
a
very
substantial
profit
on
the
sale
or
sales.
and
we
proceeded
to
do
it.”
on
the
basis
of
this
testimony,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
subject
real
property
was
held
for
development
or
sale
depending
upon
which
course
appeared
to
be
most
profitable.
and
the
plaintiffs
have
failed
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
subject
real
property
was
not
held
by
plaza,
primarily
for
sale
the
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
its
trade
or
business.
he'd
already
said
that
primarily
meant
something
broader
than
cheaper
principle.
now,
one
other
factual
point
before
i
--
before
i
finish
with
the
facts,
petitioner
has
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
rift
among
the
partners.
that
they
wouldn't
give
sold
this
property,
these
two
frontage
parcels
which
they
were
holding
for
long
term
investment.
they
would
have
sold
those
within
nine
months
after
acquisition
but
for
the
fact
that
a
rift
developed.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
district
court
heard
conflicting
testimony
on
whether
the
rift
caused
the
sale
or
not
and
determined
the
facts.
i
reach
very
briefly
the
relevant
testimony.
petitioner
testified
that
the
lack
of
report
among
the
partners
was
one
of
the
elements
that
entered
into
the
decision
it
sell.
mr.
fenmore
in
the
other
hand,
one
of
the
joint
venturers
testified,
that
there
was
no
serious
rift
among
the
partners
until
after
the
sale
of
the
two
parcels
here
in
question.
one
more
piece
of
testimony,
the
petitioner
testified
that
the
rift
was
between
misters
rogen
and
millman
on
the
one
hand.
the
two
men
were
not
at
real
estate
business
full
time
and
mr.
fenmore
and
the
other.
mr.
fenmore
then
testified
that
he
remain
partners
with
both
misters
rogen
and
millman
in
another
real
estate
deal
for
at
least
six
years
after
the
instant
sale.
now,
on
the
basis
of
this
testimony
which
--
which
we
believe
is
certainly
a
testimony,
each
way
is
to
just
how
instrumental
some
disagreement
was
because
mr.
fenmore
himself
testified
that
there
was
nothing
of
any
serious
nature
other
than
the
usual
partnership
disagreements,
we
--
which
contend
that
this
testimony
shows
some
conflict
as
to
just
what
role
a
possible
disagreement
may
have
had
in
causing
the
sale.
on
that
basis,
the
district
court
found
that
any
rift
among
the
partners
may
have
expedited
the
sale
but
that
it
didn't
change
the
essential
nature
of
the
--
of
the
parties'
intent.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
--
i
turn
it
only
because
petitioner
he
has
argued
it
rather
extensively.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
--
no
i
don't
think
they're
taking
the
middle
course.
i
think
that
the
second
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
court
of
claims
have
all
gone
along
with
the
position
we
are
here
advocating.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
eighth
circuit
which
by
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
eighth
circuit
has
said
in
the
case
somewhat
similar
to
this.
you
look
at
--
for
the
chief
purpose
for
which
it
was
acquired
and
if
the
chief
purpose
or
the
parties'
major
intent
was
to
build
on
it
and
rent,
the
fact
that
they
also
had
the
intention
to
sell
and
eventually,
did
sell
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
has
given
capital
gain.
it
is
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
factual
context
in
which
this
case
arises,
well
not
the
--
possibly
not
the
clearest
case
of
the
rent
or
sale
dual
business
is
one
aspect
of
the
rent
or
sell
business.
these
people,
we
think,
acquired
the
property
for
the
purpose
of
either
renting
or
selling
whichever
was
more
profitable.
we
think
it
just
exactly
like
the
court
of
claims
case
recordak,
in
the
recordak
case
or
the
--
there
was
recording
machinery
of
some
type,
that
the
taxpayer
manufactured
and
then
either
rent
it
or
sold.
and
they
said,
“well,
we
get
the
best
majority
of
our
income
from
the
rentals
of
the
recording
machines
rather
that
from
sales.
therefore,
our
primary
purpose
in
holding
any
given
machine
is
for
rental
rather
that
for
sale.”
the
court
said
that
whatever
the
price
--
precise
scope
of
the
troublesome
term
‘primarily'
in
other
context,
it
does
not
exclude
from
ordinary
income
the
proceeds
of
sales
by
one
who
conducts
a
dual
enterprise
involving
both
rentals
and
sales.
in
that
setting,
primarily
invokes
the
contrast
not
between
selling
and
renting
but
between
selling
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
and
selling
outside
of
that
normal
course
of
business.
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
court
reviewed
the
cases
which
this
court
is
decided
such
as
corn
products
and
the
gillette
motor
case
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
in
order
to
effectuate
congress'
intention
to
tax
his
ordinary
income,
the
everyday
business
profits
of
an
enterprise,
it
would
read
broadly
the
exceptions
from
capital
gain
and
where
necessary,
it
would
construe
“other
than
their
ordinary
sense.”
and
that's
quotation,
“other
than
their
ordinary
sense”,
the
language
of
the
capital
gain
statute.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
--
i
think
you
could
very
welcome
out
much
differently.
many
of
the
questions
would
be
primarily
questions
of
fact.
in
other
words,
if
the
case
was
a
practicing
lawyer,
who
had
acquired
a
200-acre
piece
real
estate
and
held
that
for
20
years,
never
engaged
in
the
real
estate
business
before.
held
it
for
20
years
and
then
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
it
to
put
his
children
through
college.so
he
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
subdivided
in
50-acre.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
we
don't
take
position.
no.
even
if
he
was
engaged
in
the
real
estate
business,
i
--
i'll
take
another
example,
an
individual's
engaged
in
the
real
estate
business.
his
real
estate
business
is
that
he
generally
buys
and
sells
pieces
of
property
both
in
bulk
and
by
through
subdividing
and
he
generally
turns
them
over
within
two
years
each.
that's
reasonable,
it's
a
reasonable
elapsed
time
for
turning
properties
over,
improving
them,
putting
in
streets
sewers,
etcetera,
doing
whatever
is
necessary
to
make
them
more
salable.
he
engages
in
these
activities,
he
has
salesman,
he
has
an
office.
engages
in
a
regular
course
of
activates,
he
generally
turns
it
over
for
two
years.
he
acquires
another
piece
of
property.generally,
he
deals
let's
say
in
farmland
which
he's
turning
into
subdivision
or
for
development.
here
he
acquires
a
lot
in
the
city
or
even
another
large
tract
somewhere
else
which
he
doesn't
apply
his
normal
business
acumen
to.
he
doesn't
subdivide
it.
he
doesn't
turn
it
over.
he
doesn't
bring
to
bear
his
salesman
and
all
of
his
activities.
but
he
puts
it
aside
and
lets
it
sit
20
years.
then
when
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
it,
he
takes
one
portion
of
it
and
he
subdivides
it.
we
do
not
contend
that
that
necessarily
would
bring
the
other
portion
within
the
scope
of
his
business.
it's
a
factual
question
in
most
difficult
cases
to
be
determined
on
proper
standards
of
law.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
we
--
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
the
crucial
factors,
alright.
one
fact
is
that
we
think
the
record
shows
that
the
regular
course
of
these
people's
dealings
where
to
acquire
pieces
of
property
of
this
type
45
acres,
a
hundred
acres
to
hold
it
for
a
years,
a
year
and
half
whatever
period
that
that
the
record
shows
a
number
of
such
transactions
to
a
--
meanwhile
explore
whether
they
could
build
the
apartment
buildings
on
it,
what
the
mortgage
market
was
like,
what
the
zoning
situations
was
like.
within
a
few
months
they
decide
whether
they
would
abandon
their
original
--
one
of
the
original
dual
intentions,
that
is
to
build
on
it
and
rent
it
out.
if
they
abandon,
they
would
then
subdivide
parts
of
its,
self
parts
of
it
in
bulk.
there
are
at
least
two
and
possibly
more
transactions
where
they
did
exactly
that.
in
the
buena
park
transaction,
they
held
it
eight
months
subdividing
part
selling
a
hundred
acres
in
bulk.
in
the
garden
canyon
transaction,
they
did
the
same
thing,
although,
holding
period
is
not
shown.
developed
part
of
it
and
sold
the
rest
in
bulk.
it
is
our
position
that
the
regular
course
of
business
for
these
people
that
the
way
and
which
they
earn
their
living
was
through
rentals,
through
sales
of
subdivision
individual
lots,
through
sales
of
larger
pieces
in
bulk
but
this
is
what
they
employed
their
full
time
business
activities
on.
it
is
our
position
that
the
facts
bear
out
the
findings
of
the
two
lower
courts
and
it
is
our
position
that
when
you
have
that's
sort
of
a
factual
dual
purpose
business
that
they
cannot
avoid
ordinary
income
under
everyday
business
profits
through
the
argument
that
they
were
not
holding
the
piece
of
property
--
property
primarily
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
but
that
was
merely
their
secondary
intention.
thank
you.
