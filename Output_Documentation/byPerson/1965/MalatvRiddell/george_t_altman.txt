mr.
george
t.
altman
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
involving
a
sale
of
two
pieces
of
unimproved
real
estate
with
the
very
familiar
question
of
capital
gain
versus
ordinary
income.
it
involves
a
--
an
acquisition
by
a
group
of
persons
as
a
joint
venture
and
acquisition
of
some
45
acres
in
the
los
angeles
area
with
the
purpose
of
developing
it
and
holding
it
for
rental.
there
was
testimony
indicating
that
financing
--
that
there
were
financing
and
zoning
problems
and
that
incase
--
incase
these
problems
were
not
solve
--
couldn't
be
solved
that
they
would
sell
the
property
off
in
bulk
so
they
wouldn't
get
hurt.
the
district
court
made
that
distinct
finding
that
they
would
sell
it
off
in
bulk
so
they
wouldn't
get
hurt.
the
--
they
also
made
a
finding
and
in
the
same
very
--
very
same
paragraph
that
they
were
holding
it
for
sale
or
development
for
rental
whichever
was
more
profitable.
during
the
course
of
the
escrow
--
there
was
a
six
months
escrow
and
during
the
force
of
that
escrow,
there
was
considerable
investigation
of
financing
many
efforts
to
get
first
on
a
total
project,
a
thousand
apartments
for
the
whole
thing.
then
when
they
couldn't
that,
they
broke
it
down
into
getting
smaller
units
financed.
for
that
purpose,
it
was
necessary
to
subdivide
the
property
in
order
to
cut
it
down
to
small
units.
but
even
there
and
i'm
reciting
the
history
chiefly
as
the
court
appeals
relates
it.
and
the
court
of
appeals
obtain,
i
believe,
it
has
a
very
good
opening
statement
of
the
factual
history
of
the
case.
they
had
to
break
it
down
into
a
number
of
units
in
order
to
be
able
to
finance
it
on
a
unit
basis
instead
on
a
single
basis
that
even
at
that
point
they
were
still
hoping
to
withhold
what
they
the
frontages,
two
strips,
one
on
one
street,
one
on
the
other
for
commercial
development
and
rental.
but
they
weren't
able
to
finance
the
--
even
this
and
this
was
--
all
took
place
during
the
six
months
period
of
escrow.
and
so
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out,
they
were
then
faced
with
interest,
charges,
and
payments,
and
taxes,
and
so
they
sold
the
subdivided
portion.
they
sold
it
out.
they
reported
the
ordinary
income
on
that.
apparently
on
the
theory
that
since
it
was
subdivided,
they
have
to
report
it
as
ordinary.
i
don't
think
that
question
is
before
this
court
ago
as
to
whether
that
was
right
or
whether
it
was
wrong
or
whether
it
had
any
bearing
on
their
estimate.
anyway
on
the
question
of
the
purpose,
i
think
the
record
is
very
clear
that
at
no
time
and
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
the
record
that
there
was
ever
a
purpose
of
selling
in
order
to
make
a
profit.
respondent's
briefs
attempts
page
after
page,
after
page
to
develop
some
words,
somewhere
in
the
record
that
shows
that
but
it's
a
total
failure
and
i
covered
that
in
our
replied
brief.
no
record
and
the
record
is
there
anything
to
support
the
idea
that
there
was
ever
a
plan
to
sell
the
property
in
order
to
make
a
profit.
and
the
finding
of
the
district
court
itself
says,
“that
if
their
plans
for
development
for
income
purposes
would
not
carry
out,
were
not
successful,
they
would
sell
it
off
in
bulk
so
they
wouldn't
get
hurt.”
and
insofar
--
as
far
as
i
can
see,
that
in
itself
indicates
no
idea
of
making
profit
on
the
thing
like
that.
in
fact,
it's
the
very
reverse,
it's
what
any
normal
businessman
would
do,
if
went
into
an
investment
program.
at
some
point,
he
would
try
to
protect
himself
so
he
wouldn't
get
hurt.
that
was
all
it
was
there.
now,
there
is
a
similar
conflict
you
might
say
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
will
come
to.
but,
on
that
question,
on
the
question
of
purpose
and
i
might
say
hereto
that
after
our
open
brief
was
filed,
the
government
brought
up
as
part
of
the
record
as
an
addition
to
the
record,
the
exhibits
in
the
case.
and
there
was
one
exhibit
there,
the
opening
agreement
of
the
partnership
which
shows
its
purpose,
a
very
detailed
agreement
and
nowhere,
not
in
that
document
not
anywhere
else
is
there
the
least
suggestion.
and
the
efforts
of
respondent
to
find
a
suggestion
of
a
profit
purpose
has
let
it
in
it's
brief
--
in
his
brief
into
the
some
of
the
strangest
conceptions
of
logic
that
i
have
ever
seen.
but
we
have
covered
that
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
repeat
that
now.
on
the
second
question
which
perhaps
is
the
question
why
this
court
granted
certiorari,
the
question
as
to
whether
assuming
that
situation
that
there
could
be
such
a
thing
under
the
tax
law,
under
the
word
primarily
held
for
sale
to
customer
such
a
thing
as
a
dual
purpose
in
a
situation
of
this
kind.
i
mean
note
in
passing
in
that
a
respondent
now
concedes
in
his
brief
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
ninth
and
eighth
circuits
on
that
point.
but
here
we
have
the
question
of
the
meaning
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
word
‘primarily'.
in
the
statute
primarily
help
to
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
trade
or
business.
and
it's
my
contention
that
the
words
‘primarily'
means,
what
the
dictionary
says
it
means.
there
is
not
a
single
dictionary,
and
i
went
through
15
of
them,
they're
all
set
forth
in
the
opening
brief.
not
one
which
defines
it
as
meaning
substantial.
now,
under
that
circumstance,
there
would
have
to
be
something
in
the
statute
that
there
was
in
the
agnew
case
which
is
referred
to
in
both
briefs.
something
in
the
statute
were
one
provision
said
principally
and
the
other
one
said
primarily
to
indicate
that
congress
possibly
had
in
mind,
some
kind
of
a
difference.
but
in
this
statute
there
is
nothing
that
time.
there
is
simply
the
word
‘primarily'
and
i
think
it
is
the
law
that
has
been
recognized
for
all
these
for
--
for
all
the
way
back.
that
when
a
congress
uses
a
term
unless
there
is
something
in
the
statute
or
otherwise
to
require
a
special
meaning
that
it
means
what
it
means
in
everyday
usage
so
that
the
average
person,
the
average
taxpayer,
i
might
say
in
this
case,
can
know
what
it
is
that
the
law
says.
and
i
think
and
i
submit
that
the
people
are
entitled
to
know
what
the
law
says.
now,
i
don't
doubt
and
the
respondent
has
mentioned
numerous
cases.
there
are
many
situations
where
there
is
a
rent
or
sale
situation
like
in
rollingwood.
the
rollingwood
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think
is
a
one
of
the
good
cases
on
that
where
property
was
rented
with
an
option
to
the
buyer
to
--
to
purchase
the
property,
any
number
of
cases
involving
equipment
sales,
where
it's
a
lease
or
option
with
an
option
to
buy.
it's
one
of
this
lease
or
purchase
agreements.
there
are
many
of
those.
now,
in
a
situation
like
that,
it's
entirely
deferent
and
there
i
believe
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
view
the
sale
as
being
made
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
in
fact,
the
rental
itself
is
a
sort
of
a
variant
of
a
sale.
it's
--
a
very
much
like
the
installment
character,
its
part
and
parcel
with
the
whole
--
of
the
whole
transaction.
and
the
sale
there
is
indissolubly
a
part
of
the
transaction.
so
in
that
case,
i
think
it
quite
proper
to
hold.
in
fact
that
i
believe
that
follows
the
corn
future
case,
the
corn
products
case
rather
where
the
sales
--
there's
a
course
of
sale
which
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
everyday
operation.
now,
that's
an
entirely
different
thing
because
there
--
the
sales
--
the
property
is
held
primarily
for
sale.
the
sale
is
embedded
in
all
the
transactions
and
is
the
outcome
of
the
transactions
and
the
rental
there
is
only
a
preliminary
factor
in
those
cases.
that's
an
entirely
different
story.
but
here
in
this
situation,
where
there
was
only
a
prospect,
the
possibility
that
eventually
they
might
have
to
sell
it
to
save
themselves.
that's
not
a
holding
primarily
for
sale.
that's
exact
--
that
district
court
itself
said.
that
was
held
that
they
would
sell
it
off
in
bulks
so
they
wouldn't
get
hurt.
in
fact,
i
would
say
that
here
since
the
whole
plan
was
one
for
development
as
an
income
property
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
partnership
agreement
was
a
30-year
agreement.
that
in
that
case,
the
sale
eventually
was
actually
in
derogation
of
the
primary
purpose
and
not
in
preference
of
it.
now,
so
that
in
this
case
on
the
question
whether
or
not
the
property
was
primarily
held
the
sale
to
the
(voice
overlap)
this
rent
or
sale
cases
have
no
bearing
at
all.
now
as
a
final
position,
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
when
they've
got
to
point
where
the
partners
had
a
dispute
and
they
decided
to
sell
the
property,
in
effect
really,
it
was
sale
to
two
of
the
partners.
when
they
got
to
that
point,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
that
the
resolve
to
make
that
sale
was
the
evidence
of
a
purpose
to
hold
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
trade
or
business.
now,
on
the
first
place,
that
was
obviously
not
the
ordinary
course
of
trade
or
business.
it
was
situation
in
which
all
but
two
partners
liquidated
themselves
out.
and
in
the
second
place,
it
was
--
well,
if
there's
the
same
it's
a
different
view
of
the
same
thing
that
was
really
a
sale
to
other
partners.
that
could
hardly
be
said
to
in
the
ordinary
course
of
trade
or
business
or
the
customers.
mr.
george
t.
altman
well,
there
indications
that
the
dispute
develop
over
period
of
three
or
four
months.
there
was
a
ranking
among
the
partners
because
of
the
difficulty
in
developing
their
original
plan.
now,
i
will
come
to
what
happen
during
that
period
which
could
be
significant.
now,
let
me
--
i
said
that
i
was
going
to
refer
to
a
similar
conflict
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
let
me
show
that.
i
fail
to
pick
this
up
in
either
of
my
briefs.
in
the
record,
on
page
33,
where
the
court
of
appeals
comes
to
the
question
of
the
eventual
sale
and
they
said
that
to
put
the
question
another
way,
was
it
the
exercise
of
a
purpose
not
to
hold
rather
than
of
a
purpose
to
hold
for
sale.
in
other
words,
they
were
saying
that
if
it
was
for
the
exercise
of
a
purpose
not
to
hold
and
that
would
simply
be
--
that
would
conflict
with
a
capital
gain
position.
whereas
if
it
was
for
the
exercise
of
a
purpose
to
hold
for
sale,
then
it
would
to
that
court
indicate
a
holding
for
sale
of
the
customers.
now,
on
the
first
place
i
don't
believe
that
second
position
is
sound
either
because,
if
you
say
that
on
the
basis
of
this
actual
sale
using
that
solely
as
evidence
of
a
holding,
you're
begging
question
because
there'd
be
no
taxes
if
there
were
no
sale.
there'd
be
no
problem
at
all
if
there
were
no
sales.
we
would
not
be
here
before
this
court.
they
would
be
no
gain.
there
had
to
a
sale
in
order
to
bring
the
issue
up.
now,
if
you
going
to
rely
on
that
very
sale
for
proof
a
holding.
you're
definitely
begging
the
question.
mr.
george
t.
altman
he
could
never
win,
never
win.
mr.
george
t.
altman
but
i
want
to
go
further
now
and
show
the
conflict
in
the
court
of
appeals
have
been
when
they
say
was
it
a
holding
--
was
it
a
--
the
exercise
of
a
purpose
and
not
to
hold
rather
that
of
a
purpose
to
hold
for
sale.
let's
go
back
to
page
30
where
the
court
of
appeals
in
summarizing
the
fact
says,
“so
we
took
the
next
route”,
quoting
now
from
testimony
and
proceeded
to
sell
the
lots,
that
was
after
they
were
faced
with
the
interest
charges
and
other
costs,
and
the
--
and
then
court
goes
on
to
say,
the
frontage
parcels
were
retained
still
in
a
hope
that
commercial
zoning
could
be
secured
as
to
them.
the
prospect
of
rezoning
remained
discouraging
and
the
rift
developed
among
the
venturers.
that's
where
they
show
--
when
that
prospect
of
rezoning
became
very
dim.
that's
when
the
rift
developed
among
the
--
of
the
venturers.
then
it
says
lesser
and
two
individuals
wanted
to
get
out
and
be
done
with
it.
the
other
two
wished
to
hold
on.
eventually,
those
who
wished
to
get
out
including
the
lesser
sold
out
their
interest
which
is
in
effect
what
they
did
because
one
of
the
sales
was
to
the
other,
two
partners
had
stayed
in,
and
the
other
sale
was
to
a
business
associate,
one
of
them.
so,
i'm
comparing
now
these
two
positions.
here,
they
say,
“lesser
and
two
individuals
wanted
to
get
and
be
done
with
it.”
and
over
here
the
court
says,
“what
is
the
purpose
not
to
hold.”
now,
that
was
a
purpose
then
not
to
hold.
there
wasn't
a
purpose
to
hold
for
sale.
that
was
a
purpose
simply
not
to
hold
and
the
court
itself
in
its
own
statement
on
the
facts
brings
out
that
purpose.
so
that
when
it
comes
over
to
the
final
statement
here,
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
conflict
with
its
own
history
of
the
case
when
they
said
that
they
try
to
see
in
there
a
purpose
to
hold
for
sale.
of
course,
entirely
out
of
this
one
transaction,
they
derive
that
purpose.
but
the
purpose
to
hold
for
sale
rather
than
a
purpose
not
to
hold
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
in
their
own
history
of
the
case
shows
it
was
a
purpose
strictly
not
to
hold.
mr.
george
t.
altman
yes.
the
inner
portion
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
when
they
found
that
they
were
faced
with
interest
charges
and
this
is
as
the
court
of
appeals
summarized
it
in
taxes
and
other
costs.
these
inner
parcels,
this
had
been
subdivided
not
for
the
purpose
of
sale
but
subdivided
for
the
purpose
of
smaller
units
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
--
of
development.
mr.
george
t.
altman
they
reported
that
as
ordinary
income.
mr.
george
t.
altman
yes,
sir.
they
did.
mr.
george
t.
altman
and
that
has
never
been
challenge
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
well,
i
think
the
proceeded
on
the
theory
--
your
honor,
they
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
the
property
had
been
subdivided.
in
other
words,
i
--
i
think
you
will
find
quite
a
few
cases
on
that
that
where
the
property
is
subdivided.
although,
there
are
cases
to
the
contrary
that
even
subdivisions,
if
there
was
a
purpose
to
sell
as
they
sold
these
inner
lots
because
there
were
faced
with
charges
and
they
had
no
money
that
that
would
not
derogate
against
a
position
that
it
was
capital
gain.
there
are
cases
that
indicate
that
but
there
are
cases
that
simply
say
that
if
there
was
--
if
there
was
subdivided
that's
that
in
its
ordinary
income.
mr.
george
t.
altman
it
was
strictly
on
that
basis
and
none
other.
mr.
george
t.
altman
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
this
court
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
--
has
so
held.
mr.
george
t.
altman
well,
the
factual
difference
your
honor,
if
may
speak
of
the
factual
difference
first
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
--
is
very
great.
the
first
group
had
been
subdivided,
broken
up.
the
second
were
two
pieces
of
the
property
that
it
had
not
been
touch.
there
was
no
improvement
of
any
kind
on
it.
mr.
george
t.
altman
no.
mr.
george
t.
altman
no.
the
only
difference
that
i
can
see
and
as
i
say,
the
fact
is,
i
might
point
out
a
very
recent
case.
i
don't
want
to
drag
this
in
before
the
court
but
the
fifth
circuit
just
decided
in
a
case
involving
subdivision.
that
it
was
capital
gain
not
ordinary
income
and
it's
a
split
case,
who
just
came
through
in
the
reports,
the
temple
case.
and
so,
this
court
may
eventually
be
faced
with
that
problem.
but
i
think
the
only
reason
why
they
reported
it
as
ordinary
income
was
the
fact
that
it
had
been
subdivided
and
nothing
else.
mr.
george
t.
altman
well
the
theory,
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
yes.
there
is
substantial
difference
in
theory,
i
might
say.
i
think
there
is
a
sound
basis
for
treating
a
sale
of
subdivided
lots
as
ordinary
income.
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
gain
and
value
simply
from
the
--
from
the
act
of
subdivision.
mr.
george
t.
altman
yes.
mr.
george
t.
altman
yes.
mr.
george
t.
altman
they
were
part
of
the
original
purchase.
mr.
george
t.
altman
and
these
two
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
there
is
no
contest.
we
have
not
raised
that.
i
might
say
that
i
myself
i
have
some
slight
doubt
about
it,
based
upon
other
cases
as
to
whether
they
should
have
reported
the
subdivided
lots
as
ordinary
income.
i
have
some
reservations
on
that
but
this
issue
is
not
brought
up
and
they
reported
it
as
ordinary
income.
mr.
george
t.
altman
you
mean
as
to
originally
intent?
mr.
george
t.
altman
i
think
you're
correct.
i
think
so.
now,
for
that
reason
i'd
like
to
bring
now
then
now.
what
happened
between
the
close
of
escrow
and
the
sale
of
these
two
unimproved
parcels?
the
recitation
of
the
history
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
shows,
that
the
inner
group
of
lots
were
sold
because
they
needed
money
for
the
taxes
interest
charges
and
a
so
forth.
now,
the
evidence
is
very
clear
that
after
that
took
place,
they
didn't
need
any
money.
they
could
hold
and
were
planning
to
hold
the
two
frontages,
they
were
just
holding
them
and
that's
when
the
rift
started
and
the
sale
was
entirely
because
of
the
rift.
i
think
this
is
brought
up
in
my
opening
brief
and
in
fact,
i
have
something
in
my
reply
brief
too
on
the
same
--
on
the
same
points
showing
that
--
oh,
yes!
on
pages
7
and
8
of
my
opening
brief
and
this
was
testimony
brought
out
by
the
respondent.
evidence
brought
out
by
the
respondent
which
says
and
then
the
court
said,
there
what
i
--
he
said,
“i
think,
he
said
that
was
a
reason
that
they
sold
that,
isn't
that
right?”
and
then
the
court
says,
“that
was
the
only
reason,
they
had
a
dispute.”
the
witness,
“we
could
well
still
be
sitting
with
that
property
waiting
to
develop
it
if
they
have
been
a
rapport
among
the
partners.
we
weren't
press
for
cash.
at
that
point,
they
were
not
press
for
cash,
it
was
the
difference.
when
they
sold
inner
group,
they
were
pressed
for
money.
they
had
to
meet
as
the
court
of
appeals
brings
out
all
of
these
charges.
but
after
was
done,
they
no
longer
were
pressed
for
cash.
they
were
able
to
hold
and
they
were
planning
to
hold.
and
then
the
court
--
the
district
court
said,
“i
try
to
question
mr.
malat
there.
the
court
interrupted
me.”
and
he
said,
“he
says,
mr.
altman
and
it's
very
clear,
he
said
more
than
once.
the
reason
they
sold
it
was
because
of
the
accruement
and
the
dispute
and
the
ill
feeling
between
the
partners."
and
then
i
said
yet
--
“yes.”
and
then
the
court
said,
“that
is
a
reason
they
sold
it.”
they
have
this
plan
and
they
would
have
held
it
and
made
all
three
if
they
couldn't
get
the
commercial
zoning.
it's
very
clear,
in
fact
in
my
reply
brief,
i'm
watching
clock
because
i'd
like
to
have
a
couple
minutes
left
if
i
can
for
a
rebuttal
if
necessary.
but
in
my
reply
brief,
i
bring
out
some
other
testimony
and
this
was
a
deposition
right
into
the
record
by
respondent,
not
by
the
taxpayer.
in
which
speaking
of
time
of
the
sale,
the
--
the
witness
stated,
oh,
simply
that
they
were
not
offering
it.
they
were
not
holding
it
for
sale.
they
were
not
offering
at
the
time
that
the
sale
took
place.
they
were
not
making
offers
of
that
property
for
sale.
it's
a
--
somewhere
in
this
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
--
page
11.
thank
you.
oh,
yes.
incidentally
even
at
that
time
and
this
is
right
into
the
record
by
the
respondent.
we
were
not
offering
those
properties.
that
is
the
two
frontage
pieces
for
sale,
the
crenshaw
and
century
properties.
they
were
not
listed
with
brokers.
they
were
not
advertised
for
sale.
they
were
not
being
offered
for
sale.
and
then
i
think
are
also
have
quote
from
one
of
the
respondent's
witnesses
where
--
oh,
yes!
on
page
6
were
he
says,
“well,
i
think
it
goes
much
further
than
that.
we
were
not
happy
with
the
other
people
specially
lessor.
and
we
made
the
partnership
an
author
of
those
substantial
prices
for
the
land
and
said,
either
the
land
should
be
sold
to
somebody
else
or
sold
to
us.”
that's
what
happened,
and
so
the
land
was
sold
to
them
and
the
respondent
in
his
brief
attempts
to
bring
out
that
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
buying
partners,
the
statements
of
the
buying
partners
that
--
that
the
reason
why
they
bought
it
was
to
make
a
profit
on
the
sales.
now,
naturally
that
would
mean
only
a
resale
by
them,
they
could
not
say
that
they
bought
the
property
in
order
to
make
a
profit
for
the
sellers.
that
--
i
couldn't
understand
that
at
all
and
the
testimony
bears
out
simply
the
fact
it
was
--
that
was
a
reason
why
they
bought
it,
that's
all.
and
there
is
nothing,
nothing
whatever
and
i've
gone
through
it
page
by
page
and
line
by
line,
not
just
the
record
but
the
respondent's
brief.
and
there
is
nothing
to
support
the
idea
that
there
was
a
purpose
of
profit
on
the
sale
anywhere
in
this
record.
and
the
record
is
clear,
that
between
the
time
that
the
inner
portion
was
sold,
that
after
the
inner
portion
was
sold
they
no
longer
had
any
need
from
money.
they
were
there
in
the
position
to
hold
and
intended
to
hold
for
development,
for
income
purposes.
so
that
when
this
time
came
for
the
sale,
there
was
nothing
but
that
sale.
there
is
nothing
else
upon
which
the
respondent
can
rely
to
show
that
there
was
any
purpose
of
holding
for
sale
at
that
point.
and
i
think
to
that's
fundamental
because
under
the
law
the
question
of
holding
for
sale
to
customers
must
be
attributed
to
the
period
in
which
the
sale
took
place
or
the
immediately
prior
period.
it
couldn't
go
way
back
to
the
beginning
either.
and
there
--
the
court
of
appeals
itself
says
that
many
changes
took
place
during
that
period
and
i
want
to
point
this
out
and
--
i
don't
know
if
the
court
is
familiar
with
los
angeles
statistics.
but
land
goes
up
and
value
there
from
one
day
to
the
next.
it
doesn't
get
this
matter
of
15
months
from
the
beginning
of
escrow
to
the
sale.
it's
a
long
time
in
los
angeles.
sales
of
many
pieces
of
land
have
doubled
and
tripled
and
quadrupled
in
value
in
less
time
than
that.
i
will
leave
it
at
this
your
honor
and
i
hope
that
if
have
to
have
couple
minutes
left
if
i
need
a
--
mr.
george
t.
altman
thank
you.
mr.
george
t.
altman
yes.
everything
i
think
that
counsel
has
said
is
quite
thoroughly
covered
in
my
briefs,
the
opening
and
the
closing
briefs
so
i'll
leave
most
of
it
to
that.
there
are
just
a
couple
of
points,
one
is
this.
counsel
said
that
the
statute
was
not
very
clearly
drawn.
just
what
he
meant
by
that
i'm
not
sure
but
i
believe
it
--
this
question
has
never
come
up
in
this
case
before
this
point.
i
believe
it's
again
well
understood
and
held
by
this
court
over
a
long
period
that
if
there
was
a
doubt
in
the
statute
it
couldn't
be
held
against
the
taxpayer.
so,
that's
--
on
that
point,
there
is
just
one
other
point
and
this
is,
i
frankly
say,
a
repetition
by
me.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
set
out
and
i'm
reading
again
what
i
read
a
half
an
hour
ago.
the
prospects
of
resorting
remained
discouraging
in
a
rift
about
among
the
venturers
lesser
and
two
individuals
wanted
to
get
and
get
done
with
it,
the
other
two
wish
to
hold
on,
eventually,
those
who
wished
to
get
out
including
lesser
sold
their
interest.
i
don't
believe
that
on
the
basis
of
that
statement,
it
is
possible
to
derive
the
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
derived.
because
by
their
own
statement
they
say
at
the
end
of
the
question
is
whether
their
--
the
purpose
was
not
to
hold
or
to
hold
for
sale.
but
that
statement
of
the
facts
by
the
court
of
appeals
itself
shows
that
the
purpose
of
the
sale
was
not
to
hold
as
far
as
the
sellers
were
concern.
thank
you.
