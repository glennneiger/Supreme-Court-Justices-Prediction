mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
may
it
please
the
court.
before
proceeding
into
the
statement
of
the
case
and
my
arguments,
i
think
it'll
be
helpful
that
i
present
a
brief
background
discussion
as
to
the
geography
of
the
state
of
hawaii
and
as
to
the
constitutional
provisions
with
respect
to
the
apportionment
of
the
state
legislature.
i
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
what
we
have
here,
the
state
of
hawaii
consists
of
essentially
of
four
major
islands;
the
island
of
hawaii,
the
island
of
maui,
the
island
of
oahu,
and
the
island
of
kauai.
these
four
major
islands
also
constitute
the
basis
of
our
four
county
governments.
thus,
the
island
of
hawaii
constitutes
the
county
of
hawaii,
the
island
of
maui
with
its
centralized
islands
of
molokai
and
lanai
constitutes
maui
county,
the
island
of
hawaii
and
its
neighboring
island
of
niâ€™ihau
constitutes
the
counties
of
kauai.
the
island
of
oahu
which
is
officially
designated
as
the
city
and
county
of
honolulu,
after
the
capital
city
in
the
nearby
islands.
we
will
be
variously
referring
to
the
island
of
oahu
as
the
city
and
county
of
honolulu
or
the
island
of
oahu.
i
might
also
mention
that
the
island
--
counties
of
hawaii,
maui,
and
kauai
will
variously
be
referred
to
collectively
as
the
outside
islands
or
this
neighbor
islands.
the
1960
population
of
the
state
was
in
round
figures
600,000.
the
registered
voter
population
was
about
a
third
of
that.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
your
honor,
approximately
200,000.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
the
city
and
county
of
honolulu
contained
roughly
500,000
of
the
people
thus
constituting
--
thus
having
roughly
80%
of
the
population
of
living
on
that
island.
proceeding
now
to
the
apportionment
provision
of
the
constitution,
the
state
constitution
prescribes
a
setup
of
--
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
your
honor.
the
county
of
hawaii
has
a
population
of
60,000,
the
county
of
maui,
42,000,
and
the
county
of
kauai,
28,000.
the
constitution
prescribed
the
senate
of
25
members
apportioned
among
six
districts.
it
is
apportioned
on
a
basis
of
geography
rather
than
population
and
suffice
it
to
say
that
all
parties
agree
that
the
senate
is
indisputably
malapportioned
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
the
six
districts
are
--
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
oh,
the
distances.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
roughly
around
200
miles
of
there
about,
your
honor.
under
the
senate,
these
outside
islands
with
20%
of
the
population
elect
60%
of
the
senators.
our
house,
the
constitution
prescribed
51
representatives
to
be
apportioned
among
18
districts.
the
constitution
itself
sets
out
the
boundaries
of
these
18
representative
districts
and
apportions
the
representatives
thereto.
it
provides
that
in
1959
and
every
10
years
thereafter,
the
governor
shall
reapportion
the
legislature,
but
this
is
a
very
limited
sought
of
reapportionment.
the
--
he
cannot
touch
the
existing
boundaries
as
set
forth
in
the
constitution.
he
--
what
he
does
is
redistribute
the
representatives
in
accordance
with
the
relative
numbers
of
registered
voters
in
each
district
and
only
as
a
matter
of
last
resort
and
it
--
in
the
unlikely
situation
that
the
number
of
registered
voters
falls
below
a
figure
which
is
one-half
of
the
average
number
of
registered
voters
represented
by
a
representative.
only
in
that
limited
instance
may
he
shift
a
boundary
line
presumably
to
include
more
representatives,
more
registered
voters
who
have
been
a
neighboring
district.
now
such
a
reapportionment
took
place
in
1959
and
it
is
the
one
that
is
in
effect
today.
thereunder,
we
have
five
districts
which
are
single
member
districts.
we
have
two
districts
that
are
two-member
district.
we
have
four
districts
that
are
three-member
districts.
we
have
six
districts
that
are
four-member
districts
and
then
we
have
one
district
that
is
a
six-member
district.
proceeding
now
to
the
--
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
that's
the
house
of
representative,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
sir.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
they
vary
of
course
from
--
depending
on
the
size
of
the
district.
the
six-member
district,
for
example,
which
is
the
fifteenth
district
of
oahu,
has
a
population
of
60,000
and
the
smallest
in
terms
of
population
is
the
first
district
on
the
island
of
hawaii
with
a
population
of
approximately
5,000.
however,
we
would
concede
that
generally
speaking,
the
apportionment
is
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
registered
voters
in
their
respective
districts.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
i
beg
your
--
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
but
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
apportionment
is
on
the
basis
of
registered
voters
rather
than
population.
on
a
registered
voter
basis,
the
fifteenth
representative
district
has
roughly
28,000
registered
voters.
the
first
district
on
hawaii
has
some
from
2,300
registered
voters.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes.
what
would
be
the
method
of
equal
proportions
which
is
a
--
is
a
rather
involved
mathematical
formula
is
used
in
this
case
and
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
leeway
under
that
formula
which
produces
this
divergence
in
the
proportion
of
registered
voters
to
the
number
of
representatives.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
we
attack
it
primarily
undergoing
that
is
inseparable
from
the
apportionment
of
the
senate,
but
we
do
proceed
further
and
say,
that
registered
voters
which
is
the
measure
used
here
in
and
of
itself
is
not
a
permissible
measure.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
we
are
not
pushing
that
contention,
your
honor,
because
of
the
--
we
believe
that
the
--
assuming
that
the
method
of
equal
proportions
is
a
valid
method
that
by
the
way
is
method
used
in
the
house
--
house
of
representatives
of
the
congress
unless
one
of
the
provisions
in
the
constitution
as
if
--
is
that
(a)
the
number
of
registered
voters
in
a
district
can
go
below
a
figure
which
is
less
than
one-half
the
average
number
of
registered
voters
per
representative.
by
that
i
mean,
we
take
the
total
number
of
registered
voters
in
the
state,
divide
that
by
51,
you
get
the
average
number
of
representatives
--
represented
--
average
number
of
registered
voters
represented
by
one
representative.
now,
the
constitution
provides
that
if
the
registered
voter
of
population
in
any
district
is
less
than
one-half
of
that
average.
then,
there
is
to
be
redistricting.
now,
the
fault
in
the
constitution
--
in
the
formula
of
constitution
maybe
that
this
one-half
is
actually
too
large
and
it
may
well
be
that
because
of
the
disparities
produced
thereby,
that
system
cannot
be
--
may
not
stand
constitutional
muster,
but
as
far
as
our
briefs
and
orals
are
concerned,
we
are
not
pressing
that
point
this
morning.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
qualifications
for
registering
to
vote?
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
no
there
are
no
property
qualifications
but
we
do
have
a
problem
with
as
far
as
the
military
are
concerned
as
to
their
eligibility
to
register.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
no.
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
test,
your
honor.
proceeding
now
to
the
complainant
in
this
case,
shortly
after
the
historic
decisions
of
this
court
of
june
15,
1964,
several
taxpayers,
voters
and
private
citizens
brought
action
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
hawaii,
this
was
in
april
of
1964.
they
alleged
that
the
apportionment
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
hawaii
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
they
sought
to
enjoin
the
lieutenant
governor,
who
is
the
election
officer
in
the
state,
similar
to
the
secretary
of
state
in
most
other
states
from
proceeding
with
the
conduct
of
the
elections
until
a
validly
reapportioned
legislature
was
setup.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
the
court
allowed
the
intervention
by
the
governor
and
by
--
intervention
by
the
governor
on
the
plaintiff's
side
and
intervention
by
certain
senators
and
representatives
on
the
defendant's
side.
one
of
the
requests
of
the
plaintiffs
was
that
the
1964
elections
be
enjoined
until
and
unless
a
valid
apportionment
scheme
was
developed.
the
court
declined
--
declined
to
grant
the
injunction
because
of
the
eminence
of
the
1964
elections.
thereafter
in
january,
1965,
the
hearings
were
held
and
on
february
17,
1965,
the
day
that
the
1965
session
of
the
state
legislature
convened,
the
court
issued
its
first
decision
and
order.
i
might
also
mention
that
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
during
part
of
the
earlier
proceedings,
the
governor
had
called
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
to
consider
reapportionment
legislation
in
light
of
and
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
february
order
of
the
court
invalidated
those
provisions
fixing
the
number
of
senators
for
senatorial
districts.
however,
it
validated
and
held
constitutional
all
of
the
remaining
provisions
respecting
the
apportionment
of
the
legislature.
it
held,
for
example,
that
the
number
of
senators,
25,
was
severable
and
constitutional.
it
held
that
the
apportionment
of
the
house
of
representatives
was
severable
from
that
of
the
senate.
it
held
that
the
house
was
properly
apportioned
including
the
--
validating
the
use
of
registered
voters
as
a
measure
and
also
validating
the
districting
system
employed
in
the
house.
it
went
further
--
further
to
hold
that
the
legislature
had
no
part
to
enact
provisional
plan
pending
the
adoption
of
a
permanent
constitutional
amendment.
it
ordered
that
a
convention
be
called
to
amend
the
constitution
in
time
for
1966
elections.
shortly
thereafter
in
early
march,
1965,
the
legislators
petitioned
to
the
court
to
modify
its
february
order
to
allow
the
legislature
to
prepare
and
submit
to
the
court
for
its
approval
a
provisional
plan
for
the
apportionment
of
the
senate,
also,
a
constitutional
amendment
embodying
those
provisions
of
the
provisional
plan,
and
thirdly,
a
bill
for
the
submission
to
the
electorate
of
the
question,
shall
there
be
a
constitutional
convention?
these
were
all
to
be
submitted
to
the
court
for
its
review
and
approval.
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
according
--
accordingly
modified
the
february
order.
in
mid
march,
the
court
was
informed
that
the
legislature
was
considering
a
plan
to
reapportion
the
senate,
retaining
the
six
existing
senate
districts
that
is
the
two
on
the
island
of
hawaii,
two
on
the
island
of
oahu,
and
the
remaining
two
on
the
island
of
counties
of
hawaii
and
maui.
this
would
have
given
oahu
a
nine-member
district
and
a
ten-member
district
and
given
the
other
islands,
one
member
and
two-member
districts.
the
court
informally
advised
the
legislature
that
such
a
--
an
imbalanced
districting
plan
would
not
be
acceptable.
it
also
advice
the
legislature
that
in
view
of
the
multi-member
districting
in
the
house,
any
districting
in
the
senate
other
than
single
member
districting
would
have
to
be
explained
and
justified
to
the
court.
thereafter,
in
mid
april
of
1965,
the
legislature
did
pass
a
senate
provisional
plan
and
submitted
it
to
the
court
for
its
review.
under
this
plan,
25
senators
were
to
be
apportioned
among
eight
senatorial
districts.
the
first
senatorial
district
was
the
island
of
hawaii,
apportioned
three
senators.
the
second
senatorial
district
was
the
county
of
maui,
apportioned
two
senators.
oahu
was
divided
into
five
senatorial
districts.
essentially,
they
encompass
the
house
districts
already
existing.
the
first
senatorial
district
was
covered
the
same
area
covered
by
the
eight
representative
districts.
the
fourth
senatorial
district
covered
the
area
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
representative
districts
as
well
as
a
portion
of
the
eleventh.
the
sixth
senatorial
district
or
rather
the
fifth
senatorial
district
covered
the
remaining
portion
of
the
eleventh,
all
of
the
twelfth,
all
of
the
thirteenth,
and
the
apportions
of
the
fourteenth
representative
district.
the
sixth
senatorial
district
covered
the
same
area
as
the
fifteenth
representative
district
sought
a
portion
of
the
fourteenth
district.
the
seventh
senatorial
district
covered
all
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
representative
districts.
the
eighth
senatorial
district
was
the
county
of
hawaii
with
one
senator.
a
hearing
was
held
upon
the
provisional
senate
plan
and
on
april
28,
1965,
the
court
issued
its
second
decision
and
order
disapproving
the
plan
and
reinstating
the
provisions
of
the
february
order
which
required
the
convening
of
the
convention.
in
disapproving
the
plan,
the
court
noted
that
the
apportionment
did
conform
to
the
equal
population
principle
assuming
registered
voters
to
be
a
valid
measure
of
population,
but
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
plan
nonetheless
did
not
provide
equality
of
representation.
the
court
noted
the
--
that
the
eighth
representative
district
was
quite
expensive
with
the
third
senatorial
district
that
the
fifteenth
representative
district
was
virtually
quite
expensive
with
the
sixth
senatorial
district.
now
under
the
house
plan,
there
are
six
representatives
elected
from
the
fifteenth
senatorial
district.
under
the
senate
plan,
the
sixth
senatorial
district
which
would
constitute
the
--
which
would
include
within
its
borders
the
fifteenth
representative
districts
with
the
elect
four
senators
making
a
total
of
10
senators
and
representatives,
who
would
be
elected
from
this
one
area.
the
court
noted
that
this
sort
of
concentration
of
political
power
in
these
two
districts,
created
what
it
turned
political
monoliths
giving
undue
power
to
these
two
areas.
it
held
that
the
majority
within
these
large
areas
had
disproportionate
power
and
there
was
submergence
of
the
minorities
entrapped
as
it
--
as
it
termed
it
within
the
--
these
large
areas.
the
court
noted
that
the
legislature
had
considered
such
factors
as
compactness,
contiguity,
and
proportionate,
that
apportionment
of
--
on
the
basis
of
registered
voters,
but
that
the
legislature
had
utterly
failed
to
consider
this
other
--
other
matters
such
as
the
diversity
of
the
population
in
the
various
districts.
it
had
also
failed
to
consider
the
interrelationship
of
one
district
to
another
and
the
interrelationship
of
the
apportionment
of
one
house
to
the
apportionment
of
the
other
house.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
the
apportionment
of
the
senate
was
based
on
the
1964
registered
voters.
the
court
noted
in
passing
that
the
fifteenth
--
speaking
of
the
diversity
of
population
business,
fifteen
representative
districts
elects
six
representatives
was
composed
of
an
extremely
conglomerate
population.
for
example,
the
southern
portion
is
the
--
essentially,
the
waikiki
tourist
area
where
you
have
a
middle,
middle
income,
upper
middle,
and
upper
income
groups
with
a
predominantly
from
aging
population
groups.
in
the
central
area,
we
have
a
long
established
residential
consisting
primarily
on
skilled,
semi-skilled
clerical
workers
in
the
lower
middle,
and
middle
in
come
group,
predominantly
of
japanese
extractions.
of
course,
we
have
the
campus
of
the
university
of
hawaii
and
the
surrounding
areas
which
might
be
characterized
as
the
university
community.
and
further
north
top
into
the
valleys
and
the
hillsides,
you
find
the
upper
middle
income
and
upper
income
professional
managerial
like
population.
the
court
noted
that
a
system
in
which
such
large
--
having
such
large
multi-member
representation,
would
tend
to
submerge
and
not
get
chance
for
a
voicing
of
the
divergent
points
of
view
of
the
people
within
the
area.
the
court
went
on
to
note
that
in
its
view,
the
senate
provisional
plan
was
a
result
of
gerrymandering
to
protect
the
interests
of
incumbent
senators,
for
all
of
these
reasons
have
disapproved
plan.
in
may
--
early
may,
the
governor
filed
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
appealing
essentially
from
the
provisions
of
the
february
order
upholding
the
validity
of
the
house
of
representatives.
certain
senators
and
representatives
also
filed
notices
of
appeal
dealing
essentially
from
the
april
order
which
had
disapproved
the
plan.
on
october
11,
1965,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
consolidated
the
three
appeals.
before
proceeding
to
the
argument,
i
like
to
mention
that
mr.
dennis
lyons
will
--
and
i
will
share
the
arguments,
i
will
speak
to
the
question
of
the
invalidity
of
the
districting
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
invalidity
of
the
districting
of
the
senate.
mr.
lyons
will
speak
to
the
matter
of
the
invalidity
of
registered
voters
as
a
measure
and
the
non-separability
of
the
constitutional
provisions
affecting
the
house
from
those
provisions
affecting
the
senate
from
the
state
of
hawaii.
turning
now
to
the
districting
of
the
house,
we
submit
that
the
districting
plan
of
the
house
is
arbitrary,
has
no
rationality
that
it
over
represents
the
larger
district
and
tends
to
submerge
minorities
within
those
large
districts
and
therefore
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
as
this
court
has
stated
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
the
concept
of
equal
protection
has
been
traditionally
viewed
as
requiring
the
uniform
treatment
of
persons
standing
in
the
same
relation
to
the
governmental
action
question
or
challenged.
with
respect
to
the
allocation
of
legislative
representation,
all
those
as
citizens
of
a
state,
stand
in
the
same
relation
regardless
of
where
they
live.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
differentiation
in
treatment
of
citizens
and
unless
such
differentiation
and
treatment
can
be
justified
on
a
rational
basis
that
is
relevant
to
the
purpose
of
providing
equality
and
legis
--
and
representation,
such
differentiation
cannot
stand.
in
this
case,
we
--
we
note
that
of
the
18
representative
districts,
five
are
single
member
districts.
two
are
two-member,
four
are
three-member,
six
are
four-member,
and
one
is
a
six-member
district.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
this
random
distribution
of
districts
and
as
we
will
point
out
later,
there
are
different
consequences
flowing
from
whether
a
constituent
is
in
a
single
member
district
or
in
a
multi-member
district.
we
have
different
--
differing
representation
for
different
people
defending
solely
on
where
they
happen
to
live.
there
is
no
pattern
or
consistent
policy
which
explains
the
random
distribution
of
single
member
districts,
small
multi-member
districts,
and
large
multi-member
districts.
the
proponents
of
the
house
plan
have
advanced
various
and
sundry
rationalizations
for
the
plan.
we
submit
that
the
very
number
and
variety
of
these
rationalizations
suggest
that
there
is
in
fact
no
solid
rational
basis
for
this
kind
of
distribution
and
that
these
are
in
fact,
mere
after
thoughts
to
justify
a
preexisting
plan.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
i
would
say,
no,
your
honor.
some
of
these
rationalizations
have
been
that
this
type
of
districting
promotes
broad
outlook
as
distinguished
from
localized
outlook
on
the
part
of
the
legislators.
that
--
it
would
promote
a
strong
two-party
system
as
supposedly
weak
system
that
there
are
advantages
in
edward
juniors
constitution
--
constituencies
which
could
be
more
readily
obtained
in
large
multi-member
districts.
it
is
also
claimed
that
large
districts
would
insulate
legislators
from
pressure
groups.
now,
if
--
if
these
advantages
would
exist
in
multi-member
districting,
they
may
--
they
may
support
a
districting
in
which
you
would
have
the
same
or
substantially
the
same
number
of
representatives
in
each
district
throughout
the
state,
but
it
cannot
in
any
way
explain
or
justify
the
random
distribution
of
single-member
districts
and
small
multi-member
districts
as
well
as
large
multi-member
districts
that
we
have
before
you.
other
justifications
have
been
advanced
namely
that
fixing
of
boundaries
of
legislative
districts
and
apportioning
representatives
thereto
discourages
gerrymandering.
whether
or
not
this
is
so
it
still
does
not
explain
the
random
type
of
distribution
that
we
have.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
consequences
arising
from
the
having
a
multi-member
as
against
single-member
districting.
i
dare
to
say
that
a
unified
purposive
six-man
delegation
from
a
six-member
district
has
considerably
more
weight
than
a
solitary
representative
from
a
single-member
district.
this
is
particularly
true
in
a
state
such
as
hawaii
where
we
have
a
highly
centralized
form
of
government.
education
for
example,
in
most
of
the
jurisdictions
is
on
a
local
basis.
in
hawaii
on
the
other
hand,
the
entire
educational
system
is
at
the
stage
level
and
the
legislature
provides
a
raising
of
--
provides
for
the
raising
of
revenues
and
makes
appropriations
for
the
entire
school
system
and
it
certainly
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference,
we
submit,
as
to
the
quality
and
amount
of
facilities
--
educational
facilities
that
a
constituent
gets
depending
on
whether
he
is
on
a
large
multi-member
district
or
from
a
small
multi-member
district.
turning
now
to
the
senate
apportionment
plan;
as
i
have
mention,
there
are
a
number
of
problems
inherent
in
the
random
multi-member
districting
in
the
house.
in
facing
the
senate
plan
on
the
house
districts,
the
senate
plan
compounds
and
intensified
these
problems
and
we
submit
that
the
court
below
was
entirely
correct
in
rejecting
the
senate
provisional
plan.
as
the
court
pointed
out
notwithstanding
the
great
diversity
in
the
populations
of
these
various
districts,
the
legislature
had
considered
other
factors,
but
had
failed
to
consider
these
factors
relevant
to
a
composition
of
the
â€“
relevant
to
giving
voice
to
the
divergent
views
of
the
disparate
population.
with
respect
to
burden
of
proof
and
the
discretionary
power
of
the
court
below
in
approving
or
disapproving
the
plan,
we
note
that
in
the
sense
--
since
the
legislature
itself
had
requested
permission
to
draw
of
the
plan
subject
to
the
court's
approval.
before
the
court
had
--
before
the
legislature
had
submitted
that
its
plan
the
court
had
admonished
the
legislature
that
it
would
have
to
justify
its
plan.
under
the
circumstances,
the
court
was
entirely
right
in
placing
on
this
--
on
the
legislature
the
burden
of
justifying
its
plan
and
further
more,
under
its
broad
discretion
--
discretionary
powers,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
plans
were
not
unconstitutional,
we
submit
to
the
court
couldn't
in
its
discretion
decline
to
approval
plan
which
had
genuinely
felt
to
be
a
lead
by
and
would
not
provide
effective
representation.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
the
evidence
amply
supports
the
court's
decision
that
the
plan
in
fact
was
contrary
to
the
equal
protection
clause
and
on
that
basis,
the
april
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
no,
we
--
we
do
not
contend
that
there
was
a
drawing
of
district
lines
to
exclude
any
particular
racial
group
nor
do
we
contend
that
the
district
lines
should
be
drawn
to
one
say
enclaves
for
various
racial
groups.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
legislature
should
have
considered
the
population
as
a
whole
and
provided
a
system
which
would
have
maximized
the
opportunity
for
divergent
use
to
be
express
and
in
this
context,
we
submit
that
the
single
member
district
would
have
effectively
provided
a
vehicle
for
the
divergence
of
views
to
find
representation
in
the
legislative
chambers
of
the
state.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
that
direction
your
honor
that
they
made
the
thoroughfare
known
as
king
street,
it
cuts
across
the
fifteenth
representative
district.
in
the
1964
elections,
over
45%
of
the
registered
voters
in
this
district
resided
below
king
street.
yet,
it
is
no
secret
that
there
has
never
been
a
person
from
below
king
street
who
has
been
elected
to
fifteenth
district
in
the
house
of
representatives.
we
submit
that
in
that
kind
of
situation,
your
honor,
single-member
districting
would
have
provided
a
vehicle
for
representations
of
the
views
of
the
people
living
in
these
areas.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
well,
your
honor,
this
district
is
large
enough
to
warrant
six
representatives.
we
submit
that
if
this
district
were
broken
up
into
six
single-member
districts,
for
example,
there
would
have
been
a
better
opportunity
for
a
person
of
these
views
or
views
of
these
people
in
the
state
legislature.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
what
i
said
was
that
no
one
resident
from
that
area
has
been
elected
to
the
fifteenth
representative.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
it
maybe
that
the
weight
of
the
majority
here
maybe
sufficient
to
--
to
defeat
a
representative
from
the
low
apportion
of
the
district.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
there
have
been
a
number
of
candidates
from
below
the
area
but
this
is
of
so
the
chicken
and
egg
situation,
i
submit
that
if
we
had
single
member
districts
that
their
life
there
would
have
been
great
more
candidates
running
from
that
area.
it
is
rather
--
it
is
a
rather
large
district
so
people
here
may
not
be
focus
on
the
problems
of
this
area
but
may
not
extend
sufficiently
to
these
areas
so
that
we
would
have
enough
people
to
feel
it
--
with
the
worth
their
time
or
effort
for
that
prospects
of
election
are
not
such
that
as
to
encourage
more
people
to
run
from
the
area.
whereas,
if
this
were
a
single-member
district,
there
would
be
much
more
of
an
incentive
because
of
the
community
of
peculiar
problems
within
this
white
[inaudible]
there
would
be
a
greater
likelihood
of
people
running
from
and
being
elected
to
a
district
of
that
type.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
there
have
been
no
affording
restrictions
of
such,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
as
far
as
registered
voters
are
concerned,
there
are
about
9000
registered
voters
below
the
--
below
king
street.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
be
about
10,000,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
but
there
are
more
people
living
north
of
king
street
than
there
are
in
south
king
street.
as
i
mentioned
about
45%
of
the
registered
voters
live
below
king
street,
about
55%
live
north.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
roughly
from
approximately
about
five
miles,
your
honor.
mr.
bertram
t.
kanbara
about
two
miles.
it
is
a
rather
compact
area
in
which
there's
quite
a
few
people
live.
i
have
no
further
--
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
turn
rest
over
to
mr.
lyons.
