mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
contend
that
the
provision
as
expressly
engraved
in
the
hawaii
constitution
to
the
effect
that
the
measure
of
apportionment
in
the
house
of
representatives
shall
be
on
the
basis
of
registered
voters.
we
contend
that
that
provision
cannot
be
squared
with
this
court's
decisions
of
june
1964
and
with
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
also
say
that
the
use
of
that
measure,
the
registered
voters'
measure
in
the
provisional
senate
plan
that
was
put
forward
and
rejected
by
the
district
court
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
district
court's
judgment
with
respect
to
the
senate.
our
position
is
that
a
registered
voter
is
not
in
and
of
itself
a
permissible
measure
of
legislative
apportionment
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
contend
that
the
only
measures
that
the
equal
protection
clause
permits
are
measures
which
are
based
on
population
or
some
reasonable
adjustment
thereof.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
do
not
have
permanent
personal
registration
as
i
understand
this.
there
--
there
is
permanent
personal
registration,
yes.
the
requirements
are
that
the
registrant,
be
20
years
of
age
that
he'd
be
literate
either
in
english
or
hawaiian
tongues,
that
he
have
lived
in
the
state
for
one
year,
that
he
not
be
resident
in
a
military
area
but
your
area
is
under
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
state
and
the
federal
government,
that
he
--
that
if
he
is
a
military
member
who
is
not
resident
on
a
military
area
or
dependent
thereof,
that
he
go
through
certain
other
tests.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
population
--
that
varies.
the
statewide
average
is
in
the
mid
80s.
there
are
areas
where
it
is
as
low
as
80%.
there
are
other
areas
where
it
is
about
90%.
the
basis
of
our
contention
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
it
is
in
terms
--
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the
states
generally.
that's
in
terms
however
of
the
--
of
these
eligibility
figures
that
i
give
you.
the
denominator
of
that
fraction
excludes
the
military
entirely.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
it
excludes
people
under
20
and
people
who
are
towards
on
confidence
part
of
the
population
in
any
event.
it
also
includes
the
--
excludes
the
institutional
population
and
there
is
some
figures
to
exclude
the
people
who
have
not
been
stayed
for
a
year.
the
basis
of
our
contention
is
the
language
that
this
court
used
in
reynolds
v.
sims.
population
is
of
necessity,
the
starting
point
for
consideration
and
of
controlling
the
criterion
for
judgment
in
all
legislative
apportionment
and
controversies
and
the
court's
basic
holding
at
pages
5
--
page
577,
“we
hold
that
as
a
basic
constitutional
standard.
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
the
seats
in
both
houses
of
a
bicameral
state
legislature
must
be
apportioned
on
a
population
basis.”
we
contend
that
population
is
the
starting
point
that
what
is
involved
here
is
basically
the
question
of
equality
of
representation
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
that
the
question
is
whether
all
the
people
in
the
state
are
equally
represented
within
the
terms
of
that
clause.
we
submit
that
this
is
what
the
court
meant
in
the
reynolds
case
when
it
stated
that
the
equal
protection
clause
demands
no
less
than
substantially
equal
state
legislative
representation
for
all
citizens.
and
of
course
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
because
i
think
the
entire
theory
under
which
people
may
vote
and
the
theory
under
which
they're
entitled
to
representation
are
two
different
things.
you
have
a
certain
amount
of
human
need
that's
reflected
by
all
the
people
in
the
state.
well,
that's
part
of
the
human
need
that
the
state
is
designed
to
serve
and
that
is
the
basis
for
representation
we
contend.
now
of
course
on
the
voting,
it's
time
honored
that
the
vote
is
to
be
restricted
to
people
who
are
mature
enough
to
exercise
it,
but
you
might
well
and
i
think
the
situation
of
hawaii
makes
this
vivid
where
you
have
no
school
boards
and
where
all
of
the
educations
administered
by
the
state,
you
might
well
have
various
where
there
are
retired
people
or
people
who
are
in
the
older
age
groups
where
the
children
have
moved
away.
you
have
other
areas
where
you
have
the
younger
people,
people
starting
out,
and
people
who
have
raised
many
children.
and
the
question
essentially
is
in
viewing
the
human
needs
of
the
various
areas
of
the
state.
however,
the
people
who
have
the
greatest
--
how
is
the
area
which
has
the
greatest
number
of
people
and
which
presumably
represents
the
greatest
aggregate
of
human
need
which
is
what
the
state
is
supposed
to
serve.
only
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
the
--
that
is
not
necessary
that
the
state
could
say,
though,
it
has
not
here,
the
state
has
never
made
any
judgment
base
on
military
versus
civilian.
the
origins
of
this
registered
voters
test
in
the
1950
constitutional
convention
are
not
related
to
that
issue.
but
a
state
could
say
that,
that
a
state
could
say
that,
we
believe
there
are
certain
classes
of
transients
who
are
not
part
of
the
permanent
population
of
the
state
who
do
not
represent
part
of
the
human
needs
that
our
state
has
set
up
to
serve,
we
will
exclude
them
but
i
say
that
the
state
has
to
tailor
the
measure
that
it
uses
to
produce
that
result.
it
tends
to
start
with
a
measure
which
is
not
in
its
essence
addressed
to
that
and
the
registered
voter's
measure
is
not
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
even
an
adequate
measure
of
the
civilian
population
of
hawaii.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
plays
this
part,
your
honor,
that
the
appellees
and
the
district
court
sought
to
uphold
the
registered
voter's
test
on
the
theory
that
it
excluded
the
military
population
in
substantial
part.
we
contend
that
it
was
not
the
justification
put
forward
by
the
reg
--
for
the
registered
voters
test
in
the
1950
constitutional
convention.
we
contend
that
that
justification
is
an
after
thought,
that
grossly
made
as
it
is
that
it
goes
too
far
that
there
are
elements
of
the
military,
who
might
well
be
constitutionally
required
to
be
included
in
the
population
measure.
that
in
effect
there
is
a
distinction
made
under
this
justification
between
civilian
transients
and
military
transients,
and
by
transients
i
mean,
it's
like
people
who
were
assigned
to
the
state
for
three
years.
there's
no
reason
why
a
person
who
comes
into
the
state
to
say
working
for
a
commercial
concern
assigned
to
the
sales
manager
for
three
years
and
then
go
back
to
the
mainland,
that
person
--
there's
no
basis
and
theory
to
say
that
that
person
is
--
should
be
represented
and
another
person
who
was
told
by
his
commanding
officer
to
come
into
the
state
for
three
years
and
bring
his
dependents,
why
that
person
is
to
be
excluded.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
should
have
said
that
that
person
who
is
a
native
of
hawaii
does
not
loose
his
right
to
register
by
moving
on
to
the
base.
what
should
i
have
said
is
that
no
person
living
on
a
base
who
was
not
born
in
hawaii
or
not
previously
established
hawaii
resident
can
be
considered
under
hawaii's
law
to
form
a
domiciliary
intent
as
long
as
he's
living
on
a
military
base
and
accordingly
he
will
not
be
permitted
to
register.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
if
he's
a
civilian
attached
to
the
military
service.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
he
comes
in,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
entirely
sure
but
that
is
my
impression.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
only
excludes
them
if
they
had
not
previously
qualified
as
citizens
of
hawaii,
but
there
is
a
distinction
in
treatment
as
far
as
qualifying
to
vote
as
to
when
a
military
person
comes
in,
as
to
whether
he
lives
on
the
base
or
off
the
base.
one
can
qualify
much
easier
than
they
–
not
qualify
at
all.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
or
to
--
there
might
be
other
classes
who
could
be
excluded.
the
state
might
exclude
resident
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
resident
voters.
what
i
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
what
we
--
yes,
and
we
say
that
there
are
however
two
separate
tests
involved
here
that
have
to
be
look
at
separately.
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
state
might
do
constitutionally
in
permitting
people
to
have
the
franchise
and
we
have
to
say
look
at
what
the
state
can
do
in
saying
whether
or
not
people
shall
be
entitled
to
be
counted
for
the
purposes
of
representation.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
observe
that
the
hawaii
system
is
definitely
out
of
line
with
the
predominant
trends
in
this
country
as
we
know
the
house
of
representatives
uses
a
population
based
measure,
not
a
registered
voters
within
that's,
of
course,
invalid
in
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
are
eight
other
states
that
used
registered
voters
are
qualified
for
this.
there
are
only
eight
out
of
the
fifty
that
we're
able
to
find
that
either
uses
a
qualified
voter's
test
or
a
registered
voter's
test
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
unique
in
that
respect;
of
course,
it's
not
unique
in
terms
of
the
concentration
of
military
basis.
there
are
states
like
virginia
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
--
it
is
unique
in
that
respect.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no.
i'm
not
arguing
that,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
i
did
--
i
address
myself
to
the
practical
aspects
here
of
what
a
decision
on
this
issue
by
the
court
might
mean.
in
practice,
its
effect
is
not
going
to
be
nationwide.
indeed,
if
the
person
who
comes
in
and
as
a
military
person
and
is
living
on
base
in
1960
at
the
time
of
the
census,
he
is
counted
in
determining
hawaii's
representations
in
congress.
the
odds
are
42
out
of
50
that
he
is
no
longer
counted
for
representational
basis
--
purposes
back
in
his
home
state.
now
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
42
out
of
50.
there
are
only
eight
states
that
used
registered
voters
or
qualified
voters'
measure
for
those
representations.
so,
i
was
talking
about
16%
of
the
states.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
practical
effect
would
be
quite
large.
the
original
justification
that
the
registered
voters
jived
with
population,
that
was
the
original
basis
of
setting
this
up,
that
is
quite
wrong
nowadays
in
terms
of
the
statistics.
thirty-seven
and
a
half
percent
of
the
population
of
hawaii
could
elect
a
majority
of
the
hawaii
house
of
representatives.
there
are
substantial
differences
in
the
number
of
representatives
who
would
be
apportioned
to
each
county
if
we
went
from
the
registered
voters
to
a
population
based
measure.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
are
attacking
it
to
the
extent
that
it's
based
on
registered
--
on
registered
voters
rather
than
population.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
but
we're
not
--
we're
not
saying
that
once
you
take
registered
voters
that
they
have
misallocated
them
to
the
districts
though
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
which
as
mr.
kanbara
pointed
out,
we
don't
know
quite
where
they
got
the
districts
and
that
is
the
separate
basis
for
our
contentions
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
hawaii
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
that
about
10%
of
the
population
of
hawaii
is
military.
there
are
about
60,000
military
personnel
in
hawaii
and
your
total
gross
population
is
600,000.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
is
concentration
of
military
personnel
on
the
island
of
oahu,
the
most
populous
island.
so
that
if
you
reapportioned,
now
this
is
the
difference
between
population
and
registered
voters
and
there
are
a
lot
of
other
factors
besides
the
military
in
there,
hawaii
county
which
is
the
big
island
which
now
has
seven
would
have
five,
oahu
which
is
the
honolulu
island
would
have
40
rather
than
36
representatives
and
there
were
would
be
decreases
in
the
two
other
--
other
islands
as
well.
ten
of
the
eighteen
representative
districts
would
have
a
different
representation
under
a
registered
--
under
a
population
measure
than
under
a
registered
voter
measure.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
base
to
our
population
oriented
measure
of
apportionment
in
hawaii.
the
first
one
was
the
one
that
evidently
was
behind
the
system,
that
was
the
one
that
appears
from
the
proceedings
of
the
1950
constitutional
convention
that
framed
the
article
in
question,
and
that
was
that
the
registered
voter
was
substantially
equivalent
to
population.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is
not.
the
thirty-seven
and
a
half
percent
of
the
population
have
elect
a
majority
of
the
legislature
that
there
are
substantial
disparities
in
the
representation
of
the
various
islands
and
the
various
districts.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
in
the
case
is
something
that's
applied
across
the
board
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i've
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
they
could
because
we
don't
have
an
exhaustive
code
of
constitutional
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no.
because
we
don't
know
exactly
until
they
self-align
and
tried
to
draw
it
in
terms
of
registration
and
how
far
they
could
go.
what
the
population
does
--
what
the
record
does
give
you
in
generally
on
the
island
by
island
basis
are
the
total
number
of
military
and
a
total
number
of
dependents.
the
total
number
of
people
living
on
military
areas,
the
people
under
20
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
state
has
never
indicated
any
intention
to
exclude
military
people
from
the
reapportionment
from
the
apportionment
base.
the
only
legislative
history
that
we
see
to
have
on
this
is
the
same
as
of
1950
convention
that
the
registered
voters
was
chosen
one
because
it
was
thought
to
be
substantially
equivalent
to
population
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
the
--
there
are
--
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
first,
that
even
if
you
took
civilian
population,
the
--
you
still
have
disparities
under
the
registered
voters
system.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
we
have
footnote
in
our
brief,
footnote
25
on
page
63
goes
into
--
to
that.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
it
is
your
honor
that,
first,
you
start
with
a
--
a
case
where
all
the
purported
justifications
for
this
measure
do
not
appear
in
the
--
in
the
record
of
what
motivated
the
states
to
do
this.
you
have
the
second
factor
as
a
matter
of
theory
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
use
of
the
registered
voter's
test
does
not
cut
the
same
--
quite
the
same
way
as
eliminating
the
military
population.
they
got
the
further
point
which
i
think
was
inherent
in
my
answer
to
your
honor's
first
question
which
was
that
you
don't
know
quite
how
far
the
state
could
constitutionally
go
in
either
excluding
military
from
voting
or
excluding
them
from
registering
until
the
state
comes
forward
and
gives
to
you
some
sort
of
attempt
to
draw
the
line.
and
that
would,
we
submit,
if
the
court
and
an
opportunity
to
make
constitutional
judgment
as
to
the
voting
line
and
as
to
the
representation
line,
but
all
the
state
has
done
here
has
said
that
registered
voters
shall
be
the
measure
and
for
all
it
appears
but
they
didn't
have
the
military
minds.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
if
the
state
also
said,
that
it
also
excludes
the
same
civilians
that
we
may
exclude
and
i
think
the
teaching
of
davis
v.
mann
is
that
you
cannot
discriminate
against
the
military
as
such
and
in
the
representation
here
there
are,
some
evidences
of
the
discrimination
against
the
military
as
such
in
that
the
military
will
move
on
to
these
military
areas,
perhaps,
concerned
ever
as
having
informed
the
requisite
domiciliary
area
intent.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
alien
population
i
believe
is
less
than
10%,
i
think
it's
in
the
order
of
about
40,000
which
would
be
about
7,
8%.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
they
do.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
military
--
the
--
there
are
some
discrepancies
between
the
census
and
the
department
of
defense,
but
the
military
appears
from
the
record
to
be
around
60,000
or
10%.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
there
are
different
categories
in
the
statistic
tables
that
appear
at
the
end
of
the
record
and
from
them
you
can
get
by
islands,
not
by
districts
the
number
of
military
on
each
island,
the
number
of
dependents,
military
dependents
on
each
one
of
those
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
and
you
could
also
get
the
total
number
of
people
in
military
areas,
but
there's
no
way
of
superimposing
each
of
those
three
categories
on
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
they
are
concurrent
jurisdiction
area.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
they
do
not.
it's
the
simple
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
crimes
as
i
understand
it.
but
you
don't
have
a
--
a
situation
where
the
only
law
in
the
area
is
--
is
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well
i
consider
them
both
but
they
are
part
of
the
state
of
hawaii
and
then
we
don't
have
a
situation
here
like
the
district
of
columbia
or
this
is
not
an
exclusive
legislature
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
--
they
don't
accept
that
declaration
unless
he
was
previously
a
resident
of
hawaii.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor
i
would
say
this.
first,
i
would
say
that
a
state
cannot
exclude
military
personnel
as
such
from
the
representation
things.
they
can
only
do
so
on
the
basis
that
was
equally
applied
with
the
civilians.
as
to
the
aliens,
i
think
that
we
have
not
far
over
with
proposition
that
a
state
could
modify
the
total
population
standard
so
as
to
simply
pick
up
civilian
not
part
from
a
citizen
population
that
the
ties
between
a
person
who
is
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
a
person
who
is
not
different
and
then
a
state
could
make
a
distinction
based
on
that.
but
once
again
that's
an
adjustment
of
a
population
based
measure
not
a
measure
that
starts
from
the
other
direction
and
it
says
we
will
start
with
the
number
of
people
who
are
actually
registered
in
both.
and
there
is
no
showing
as
to
whether
you
would
accidentally
get
the
apportionment
in
hawaii
that
exists
if
you
eliminate
the
aliens.
in
fact,
the
aliens
are
pretty
well
distributed
throughout
the
island
so
that
the
chances
are
that
you
would
not
by
accident
recreate
the
present
system
of
representation.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
[inaudible]
i
think
seven
or
eight,
seven
or
eight.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
you
have
this
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
sir.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
in
--
i
think
the
court
need
no
--
go
no
further
in
this
case
than
to
say
that
there
must
be
a
population
oriented
basis
of
--
of
apportionment.
what
is
used
here
is
not
a
population
less
something.
it's
a
registered
voter's
test
which
is
diametrically
we
submit
a
post.
now
as
to
what
modifications
in
a
population
based
test
could
be
justified
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
really,
we
submit,
that's
a
question
for
another
day.
that
what
the
state
has
done
here
is
simply
to
use
a
measure
that's
quite
different
that
produces
quite
a
different
result
from
a
total
population
measure.
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
in
terms
of
--
well,
we
--
we
make
no
--
in
the
first
place,
we
are
not
here
attacking
the
system
of
voting.
we're
not
saying
that
there
are
unconstitutionally
depriving
anyone
of
the
right
to
vote.
but
what
we
contend
for
is
that
the
right
that
the
court
recognized
in
reynolds
v.
sims
and
the
companion
cases
is
a
right
to
cast
one's
vote
in
districts
that
are
properly
apportioned
on
an
equal
population
standard
or
that's
a
question
for
it
need
not
reach
today,
on
some
permissible
adjustment
of
the
equal
population
standard
and
the
hawaii
test
is
simply
not
that.
there
is
a
further
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
very
briefly
and
i
think
it's
a
very
important
practical
point,
it
relates
to
one
of
the
extraordinary
actions
that
the
district
court
took
here.
in
the
february
1965,
order
of
the
district
court
after
the
district
court
had
held
that
the
number
of
senators
for
senatorial
district
that
was
contained
in
the
hawaii
constitution
was
unconstitutional
that
i
didn't
square
off
with
this
court's
decisions
and
with
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
court
went
on
to
make
what
we
contend
to
be
an
extraordinary
affirmative
declaration,
it's
--
and
this
is
part
of
its
order.
the
remainder
of
article
3
of
said
constitution,
this
is
the
provision
dealing
with
the
legislature,
is
declared
constitutional
and
valid.
the
district
court
there
went
beyond
simply
stating
its
views
as
to
certain
of
the
issues
that
were
involved
in
the
case.
what
it
did
was
to
make
an
affirmative
declaration
first
that
the
entire
house
apportionment
system
was
valid
even
though
at
this
point
no
longer
had
any
senate
before
it,
just
look
into
the
house
by
itself.
that
the
districting
system
in
the
house
was
constitutional
and
that
every
other
assumption
that
went
to
make
up
the
house
was
constitutional.
the
district
court
also
and
went
quite
far
of
its
way
to
do
this,
affirmatively
upheld
as
constitutional
the
number
of
senators
provided
in
the
state
constitution
to
comprise
the
senate.
we
submit
that
this
is,
in
the
first
place
a
clear
violation
of
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
the
tawes
case
where
the
court
said,
“in
reviewing
a
state
legislative
apportionment
case,
this
court
of
necessity
must
consider
the
challenged
scheme
as
a
whole
in
determining
whether
the
particular
state's
apportionment
plan
in
its
entirety
meets
federal
constitutional
requisites.
it
is
simply
impossible
to
decide
upon
the
validity
of
the
apportionment
of
one
house
of
a
bicameral
legislature
in
the
abstract
without
also
evaluating
the
actual
scheme
of
representation
employed
with
respect
to
the
other
house.
now,
it
was
this
teaching
that
the
district
court
disregarded
in
affirmatively
declaring
these
provisions
of
the
house
and
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
senate
constitutional.
this
is
more
than
an
academic
point.
what
then
happened
was
that,
all
these
points
the
house
apportionment,
the
number
of
senators
and
the
other
details
in
the
house,
the
registered
voters
measure
were
taken
as
given,
they
are
taken
as
part
of
the
essential
given
data
that
the
legislature
had
to
work
with
in
trying
to
work
out
a
system
of
overall
apportionment
for
the
state
legislature
because
the
registered
voters
had
been
affirmatively
upheld
in
the
house”
it
was
in
fact
under
the
form
of
order
that
the
district
court
used
in
march
beyond
the
competence
of
the
legislature
to
inquire
into
that.
it
was
beyond
their
competence
to
make
adjustments
in
the
house.
all
that
they
were
left
to
do
by
the
district
court
was
starting
with
a
25-man
senate,
starting
with
an
arrangement
under
which
the
house
couldn't
be
touched.
they
had
to
work
out
a
plan
for
the
apportionment
of
the
senate.
we
contend
that
the
plan
that
they
came
up
with
under
which
the
district
court
in
effect
and
in
terms
maybe
used
of
registered
voters
in
the
senate
mandatory
and
in
which
in
practical
effect,
they
were
bound
to
be
these
large
multi-member
districts
in
the
senates
because
of
the
apportionment
in
the
house
and
the
understandable
desire
to
have
senate
districts
that
were
bigger
than
house
districts.
that
by
so
doing,
the
district
court
unnecessarily
and
we
contend
erroneously
injected
it
self
into
the
--
what
should
have
been
in
the
first
instance
a
question
for
the
legislature?
it
deprived
the
legislature
of
freedom
of
action
in
the
number
of
alternatives
that
the
legislature
could
adjust
in
coming
to
an
overall
apportionment.
even
if,
despite
our
contention,
the
use
of
registered
voters
is
not
unconstitutional
and
the
districting
system
in
the
house,
the
multi-member
in
varying
single-member
system
is
not
unconstitutional,
we
contend
that
it
was
error
for
the
district
court
to
freeze
those
possibilities
and
that
what
the
district
court
then
did
affected
the
plan
that
the
senate
came
up
with
in
response
to
the
district
court's
order.
now,
some
of
the
appellees
suggest
that
at
most
this
was
harmless
error
or
that
it
was
cured
by
what
the
legislature
then
did.
well,
we
would
say
that
the
answer
is
not
simply
even
if
it
were
the
case
that
plan
that
the
legislature
came
up
with
this
constitutional.
the
basic
error
is
that
the
district
court
improperly
froze
the
alternatives
that
the
legislature
had
and
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
of
course
not
cured
by
a
plan
which
reflects
the
inflexibilities
that
were
imposed
upon
the
legislature.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
was
your
honor,
just
as
it
was
here.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
oh,
we
do
your
honor.
we
attack
the
districting
system.
we
attack
the
use
of
registered
voters
and
those
are
the
two
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
points.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
your
honor
that
--
that
is
the
case
that
we
have
no
questions
other
than
the
multi-member
districting
and
the
registered
voters.
however,
the
multiple-member
districting,
we
don't
attack
on
a
per
se
basis.
we
contend
in
effect
that
the
multiple-member
districting
system
here
in
the
house
was
compounded
by
the
system
that
the
senate
provisional
plan
adopted
and
this
isn't
an
overall
issue
the
way
that
registered
voters
is.
so,
the
fullness
of
the
inadequacies
of
the
multi-member
system
in
the
house
can't
be
judged
apart
from
the
system
prevailing
the
senate.
thank
you.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
restate
the
nature
of
our
objection
to
the
multi-member
districting
both
in
the
house
and
in
the
proposed
senate
plan
and
that
is
essentially
to
its
random
and
arbitrary
character.
there
has
been
no
showing
and
i
believe
we
heard
no
showing
here
this
afternoon
as
to
how
these
districts
really
happen
to
get
the
way
that
they
are.
why
some
of
them
are
one
member
and
why
some
have
as
many
as
six?
even
in
downtown
honolulu,
there
is
a
district
right
here
the
thirteenth
with
two
members.
there's
a
district
here,
the
fifteenth
with
six
members.
the
only
specific
justification
that
we
heard
as
to
the
construction
of
the
districts
was
that
it
was
stated
that
some
of
them
coincided
with
these
long
standing
administrative
districts
which
are
now
used
basically
by
the
way
to
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
justice
and
peace
courts.
that
could
only
be
taken
as
a
counting
for
three
out
of
the
eighteen.
there
are
these
administrative
districts
throughout
the
whole
state.
the
only
ones
that
are
sought
to
be
justified
on
this
basis
are
three
of
the
eighteen
districts
and
there
are
even
some
of
these
very
several
administrative
districts
together
and
created
a
multi-member
districts.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
we've
shown
first
that
there
is
this
great
disparity
and
we've
said
that
there
is
no
consistent
pattern.
we've
shown
there
is
no
consistent
pattern.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
if
there
were
some
single
standard
that
was
applied
to
construct
them
all
that
would
be
a
consistent
pattern.
if
you
have
the
county,
you
insist
him
in
fortson
versus
dorsey,
but
you've
got
a
variety
of
systems
there.
you
have
many
systems
as
you
have
posted
many
systems
as
you
have.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
it's
completely
an
arbitrary
determination
of
whether
or
not
represented
by
six
people
or
represented
by
one
person
who
makes
that
depends
strictly
on
geographic
considerations
which
we
believe
this
court
has
taught
us
impermissible.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
not
that
it's
inherently
arbitrary.
there
are
obvious
differences
in
the
amount
of
representation
that
you
have.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
unless
there
is
some
rational
basis
on
which
that
could
be
done
i
would
contend
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
that.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
and
if
there's
no
consistent
pattern
as
to
determine
how
many
have
hwat.
on
the
other
point,
the
registered
voters
versus
population,
i
think
the
main
point
that
we
have
to
make
here
is
one
would
be
the
right
here
is
the
right
of
representation.
the
court
said
that,
the
equal
protection
clause
demands
no
less
than
substantially
equal
representation
for
all
citizens.
the
measure
that
is
aimed
at
that
is
population,
a
registered
voter
is
a
measure
that
is
aimed
at
something
entirely
different.
