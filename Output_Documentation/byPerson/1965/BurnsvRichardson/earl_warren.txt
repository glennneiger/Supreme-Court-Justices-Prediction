chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
third
of
that
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
--
i
wonder
if
before
that
you
could
tell
us
about
what
populations
are
on
the
other
islands,
the
other
counties,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
that
--
that
the
senate
that
you’re
speaking
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that’s
the
house
of
representative.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
all
those
districts
come
out
to
population
wise?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
there
is
12
--
there
is
12
to
1
ratio
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
--
i
understood
him
to
say
60,000
in
one
and
five
in
the
other.
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
28,000
did
you
say
in
one
and
2,300
in
another?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
six;
one
is
a
one
representative
district
and
the
other
is
a
six
representative
district,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
--
do
you
attack
the
apportionment
of
the
house
as
being
not
according
to
population
or
do
you
do
it
merely
because
it's
inseparable
from
the
--
the
apportionment
of
the
senate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
--
but
if
we
--
if
we
should
determine
that
it
could
be
on
a
--
on
a
voters
--
registered
voters
basis,
would
there
be
a
malapportionment
in
the
house
of
representatives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
alleged
gerrymandering
as
between
the
islands?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kanbara,
may
i
ask
you
if
--
if
there
is
any
claim
that
gerrymandering
so
far
as
the
district
lines
are
concerned
in
the
senate
in
order
to
exclude
minority
groups
or
anyone
else
from
--
from
proper
representation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
do
--
do
you
make
--
do
you
make
any
contention
that
any
particular
group
in
your
state
has
been
prejudiced
by
reason
of
this
districting
and
then
so
what
--
what
groups
have
been
prejudiced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
they
should
have
broken
up
the
--
the
districts
below
the
highway
so
that
they
would
be
attached
to
other
districts
where
people
were
elected
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
see
your
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
there
been
any
voting
restrictions
or
--
or
any
kind
of
prejudice
exercised
to
prevent
the
people
in
that
area
from
being
elected
to
public
office?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
there
been
any
voting
restrictions
applied
to
the
class
of
people
of
live
below
that
highway
that
you
pointed
out
to
us
that
contributed
to
their
failure
to
have
any
representation
or
have
the
voting
--
voting
laws
been
fairly
administered
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
been
fairly
administered
laws.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question,
how
many
people
live
below
that
line
that
you
mentioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
lyons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
rather
high
registration,
is
it
not
compared
with
other
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
take
the
position
with
all
military
people
must
be
included?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
what
--
what
aspect
of
the
military
the
personnel
comes
into
this
case?
it's
been
mentioned
several
times
by
you
and
by
--
and
by
your
associate,
i
just
wonder
what
part
it
plays
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
percentage
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
--
i
understood
you
were
not
attacking
the
--
the
proportionate
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that
is
--
that
is
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
know
what
percentage
of
the
population
of
hawaii
is
military
and
what
is
civilian?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
--
would
that
hold
true
in
throughout
the
islands
or
would
there
might
there
be
some
islands
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this?
does
the
fact
that
relying
on
voting
registration
eliminates
aliens
as
well
as
these
members
of
the
armed
forces
leads
you
to
the
same
conclusion
so
far
as
aliens
are
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
about
10%
of
the
population
who
is
military
and
about
10%
was
alien.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
wouldn't
that
overall
effect
dilute
somebody's
vote
or
if
it
happens
in
the
case
of
military,
wouldn't
it
also
happen
in
the
case
of
the
aliens?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
use
--
you
use
the
word
population.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
take
it
from
reynolds
v.
sims
and
you
rely
on
that
word
in
question.
now,
if
that
--
if
you
do,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
much
of
a
distinction
between
aliens
and
military?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
not
--
why
did
not
do
the
same
thing
with
the
--
with
the
military
depending
upon
how
the
state
of
hawaii
interpreted
its
own
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lyons
in
the
--
in
the
tawes
case
which
one
is
maryland,
the
apportionment
in
both
houses
was
attacked,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
but
here
when
you
come
to
us,
you
don't
attack
the
--
you
don't
attack
the
apportionment
in
the
house
standing
alone,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
but
that
is
something
common
to
both
houses
and
something
be
common
to
all
legislatures
if
you
--
if
voters
registration
is
not
an
adequate
basis
then
--
then
it's
all
out
that's
true.
but
so
far
as
the
apportionment
is
concerned,
in
this
case,
i
understood
your
colleague
to
say
that
if
we
didn't
--
if
we
didn't
consider
the
multiple
district
to
issue
and
the
voter
registration
issue
have
vital
importance
to
the
state,
then
you
had
no
objection
to
the
apportionment
of
the
lower
house
because
it
was
done
on
a
--
an
equal
basis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
naito.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
enough
people
in
anyone
of
these
smaller
islands
that
the
counsel
referred
to
as
satellite
islands
large
enough
for
a
single
district,
either
in
the
senate
or
the
house?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
island
would
that
be,
that
would
be
lanai?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
molokai.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
there
is
no
single
island
that
--
there's
no
single
island
that
wouldn't
be
large
enough
for
a
single
representative?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
none.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
go
on,
may
i
ask
you,
what
administrative
units
you
referred
to?
what
is
the
character
of
those
administrative
units?
chief
justice
earl
warren
use
as
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
judicial
district.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
stating
that
again
please,
his
statement
in
his
reply
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
--
even
though,
some
of
the
districts
were
one
representative
districts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
some
were
--
if
some
were
single
districts
and
some
multi
districts
but
the
--
all
the
multi
districts
were
two,
let's
say,
do
i
understand
that
your
statement
is
that
--
then
there
would
be
no
objection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
funaki.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
district,
could
you
tell
us
from
numbers
what
that
fluctuation
has
been
in
recent
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
388.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
this
include
the
civil
service
employees
of
the
armed
forces
or
just
a
men
in
uniform?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
not
the
transient
workers
in
the
civil
service
of
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
any
statistic
on
that
that
you
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
civil
service.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
funaki,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
state
of
hawaii
has
in
anyway
discriminated
against
military
men
in
voting
as
distinguished
from
the
citizens?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dodge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
suppose
that
you'd
have
somewhat
the
same
situation
that
you
based
--
based
your
representation
on
population
because
there
would
be
a
lot
of
people
who
die,
people
go
away,
and
so
forth
so
that
would
affect
it
as
much
as
--
as
those
who
don't
vote.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
frequently,
is
that
understood
in
the
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marumoto.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
lyons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll
adjourn.
