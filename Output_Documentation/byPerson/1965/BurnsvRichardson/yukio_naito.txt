mr.
yukio
naito
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
members
of
the
senate
of
the
hawaii
legislature.
i
wish
to
indicate
at
the
start
that
the
members
of
the
senate
and
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
hawaii
legislature
are
in
substantial
agreement
on
all
of
the
issues
which
are
raised
in
all
of
the
cases
before
this
court.
in
interest
of
time
and
because
the
house
is
represented
by
counsel
also,
i
will
be
focusing
my
attention
on
a
question
of
the
multi-member
districting
system
utilized
in
both
houses
of
the
hawaii
legislature.
mr.
funaki,
who
represents
the
members
of
the
house,
will
be
focusing
his
attention
upon
the
question
of
the
registered
voters.
now
with
respect
to
the
multi-member
districting
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
i
think
the
focus
of
attention
should
be
on
the
question
whether
or
not
it
has
been
shown
by
evidence
in
court
below
the
multi-member
districting
system
of
the
house
and
the
multi-member
districting
system
for
the
proposed
senate,
operate
to
minimize
or
cancel
out
the
voting
strength
of
any
voter
in
any
district
and
we
submit
that
the
answer
is
that
it
has
not
been
so
demonstrated
by
any
evidence.
i
believe
this
court
in
reynolds
v.
sims
and
again
in
fortson
v.
dorsey
had
indicated
that
the
overriding
consideration
in
apportionment
of
the
legislature
is
that
the
districts
be
substantially
equal
in
population
so
that
the
weight
of
the
vote
of
a
voter
in
one
district
is
no
different
by
the
weight
of
a
vote
of
the
vote
--
of
a
voter
in
another
district.
in
this
connection,
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
scope
and
the
tenure
of
the
district
court's
decisions
which
are
rendered
below.
in
its
first
decision,
there
is
only
one
reference
with
respect
to
multi-member
districts.
the
district
court
in
enjoining
the
legislature
from
enacting
any
legislation
until
they
passed
a
bill
which
have
placed
a
question
to
the
electorate
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
convention
to
be
convened
discussed
some
of
the
things
which
a
constitutional
convention
may
desire
to
consider.
and
in
this
connection
the
district
court
indicated
that
a
constitutional
convention
may
wish
to
consider
the
question
whether
or
not
the
--
whether
or
not
the
legislature
or
whether
or
not
the
legislature
should
be
apportioned
and
neither
one
for
both
houses
among
multi-member
districts,
and
in
that
event
to
justify
the
creation
of
such
multi-member
districts.
and
to
these
we're
justifying
the
district
court
had
attended
in
a
footnote
and
it
cited
in
that
footnote
the
case
which
arose
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
1964
by
the
name
of
butcher
versus
bloom,
this
is
found
in
volume
203
of
the
fed
2d.
then
between
the
first
decision
and
the
second
decision,
a
memorandum
was
issued
by
one
of
the
three
judges.
judge
beeks
issued
a
memorandum
to
judge
pence
and
this
memorandum
was
circulated
among
counsel
involved
in
this
case.
and
in
this
memorandum,
judge
beeks
indicated
that,
while
there
maybe
some
valid
reasons
for
one
or
two-member
districts
on
the
neighbor
islands
that
the
court
could
conceive
of
no
justification
whatsoever
that
a
creation
of
other
than
single-member
districts
on
the
island
of
oahu.
there
was
no
explanation
given
for
this
particular
statement.
then
in
april
decision,
the
district
court
rejected
the
proposed
senate
plan
primarily
because
it
was
districted
among
multi-member
districts.
and
in
this
connection,
the
district
court
again
cited
and
relied
upon
the
case
of
butcher
versus
bloom,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
case,
in
none
of
the
decisions
did
the
district
court
ever
discuss
the
impact
and
importance
of
fortson
v.
dorsey.
this
leads
us
to
believe
that
perhaps
the
district
court
was
either
ignoring
the
contents
of
the
case
of
fortson
v.
dorsey
or
that
the
court
was
not
conscious
of
the
impact
of
that
decision
rendered
by
this
court.
if
i
understand
the
case
of
fortson
v.
dorsey
correctly,
it
seems
to
say
that
there
was
nothing
invidious
per
se
about
multi-member
districts
in
any
house
of
the
legislature,
but
that
if
it
is
ever
demonstrated
that
a
multi-member
districting
system
minimizes
or
cancels
out
the
voting
strength
of
any
voting
or
any
voter
then
at
that
time
this
court
would
focus
attention
upon
that
question.
the
governor
of
the
state
of
hawaii
agrees
with
the
other
parties
in
this
case
that
multi-member
districting
system
per
se
is
not
unconstitutional.
however,
they
indicate
that
in
the
particular
case
of
hawaii,
a
multi-member
districting
system
makes
the
hawaii
legislature
unconstitutional
and
they
rely
upon
various
arguments
including
the
argument
which
has
been
made
before
this
court
that
the
districts
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
are
created
arbitrarily,
second,
that
the
large
multi-member
districts
are
over
represented
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
single-member
districts,
and
third,
that
there
is
a
submergence
of
minority
in
large
multi-member
districts.
i
wish
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
arbitrariness
of
the
multi-member
districts.
it
is
contended
by
the
governor
of
hawaii
that
the
multi-member
districts
are
arbitrarily
created
because
first,
the
multi-member
districts
are
not
uniform
in
that
there
are
different
numbers
of
senators
and
different
numbers
of
representatives
being
elected
from
the
various
legislative
districts.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
which
has
been
decided
by
this
court
or
by
any
court
which
requires
that
in
the
case
of
a
multi-member
district
that
all
multi-member
districts
must
have
the
same
number
of
representatives
and
the
same
number
of
senators.
mr.
yukio
naito
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
basically
the
state
has
been
concerned
with
what
they
call
the
basic
areas
which
the
basic
areas
are
the
counties.
the
counties
have
been
designated
as
basic
areas
and
based
upon
the
number
of
voters
registered
in
the
respective
counties,
the
number
of
senators
and
representatives
were
assigned
to
various
counties.
for
example,
if
you
will
note
in
the
senate
reapportionment
plan,
three
senators
were
assigned
to
the
big
island,
that's
the
island
of
hawaii
and
that
was
in
proportion
to
the
voter
registration.
that
county
or
the
three
senators
from
the
island
of
hawaii
are
elected
at
large.
two
senators
were
assigned
to
what
is
known
as
the
county
of
maui
which
is
composed
of
three
islands.
two
islands
have
community
of
interest
in
that
they
are
small
--
they
have
small
population
and
primarily
pineapple
plantation.
and
these
two
islands
were
combined
for
the
purpose
of
electing
--
i'm
sorry,
i'm
getting
mixed
up
with
the
house.
but
for
the
county
of
maui,
the
two
senators
were
to
be
elected
at
large,
so
also
in
the
county
of
kauai.
on
the
--
in
the
sitting
county
of
honolulu
which
is
the
island
of
oahu,
the
population
concentration
is
too
great
to
have
the
--
or
the
legislator
felt
--
the
legislature
felt
that
the
population
is
too
great
to
have
all
of
the
19
senators
elected
at
large.
so,
what
the
legislature
did
in
this
case
was
to
take
historical
administrative
units
and
assigned
senators
in
proportion
to
the
population
or
the
voter
registration
in
each
of
these
administrative
units
except
--
mr.
yukio
naito
there's
a
unit
known
as
the
cool
out
before
the
eighth
district
representative
district,
that's
the
district
called
waialua
and
there's
the
district
of
ewa.
then
the
rest
are
all
in
the
city
of
honolulu
proper
--
mr.
yukio
naito
yes.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
history
behind
the
division
of
the
island
of
oahu
into
various
administrative
districts.
that
has
been
used
since
before
hawaii
was
a
next
mighty
place.
mr.
yukio
naito
yes,
they
are.
mr.
yukio
naito
yes.
except
for
the
city
of
honolulu
where
again
on
oahu,
this
is
the
heaviest
population
concentrated
area.
and
here
what
the
legislature
did
for
the
senate
and
what
the
constitution
of
convention
did
for
the
house
of
representatives
was
to
take
geographic
lines
which
run
from
the
mountain
to
the
sea
in
creating
the
various
senatorial
and
representative
districts
and
an
effort
was
made
to
equalize
the
population
in
each
of
these
districts.
this
is
why
we
say
that
there
has
been
no
arbitrariness
in
a
creation
of
the
senatorial
and
represented
districts.
mr.
yukio
naito
for
the
senate,
there
is
no
single-member
district
on
the
island
of
oahu.
the
number
runs
there
are
four
four-member
districts
and
three
--
one
three-member
district.
for
the
house
of
representatives,
it
runs
from
two-member
district
to
six-member
district.
mr.
yukio
naito
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
yukio
naito
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
yukio
naito
the
single-member
district,
we
do
have
on
the
island
of
hawaii.
this
is
the
county
of
hawaii.
mr.
yukio
naito
yes.
mr.
yukio
naito
that's
correct.
mr.
yukio
naito
yes.
this
is
for
the
house
of
representatives.
these
two
tiny
islands
are
primarily
plantation
communities
and
they
have
to
combine
the
point
--
mr.
yukio
naito
one
representative
district.
mr.
yukio
naito
the
senators
are
elected
at
large.
the
--
for
the
county
of
hawaii,
all
of
the
representatives
and
all
of
the
senators
they
elect
is
at
large.
mr.
yukio
naito
i
believe
your
honor
that
if
the
constitution
of
convention
of
the
legislature
desires
to
create
single-member
districts.
we
must
agree
with
the
counsel
for
the
governor
that
it
is
possible
to
create
single
member
districts.
mr.
yukio
naito
i'm
afraid
the
population
is
too
small
for
lanai.
mr.
yukio
naito
and
so
of
the
molokai.
mr.
yukio
naito
combined
together
they
would
form
one
representative
district.
mr.
yukio
naito
no,
your
honor.
there
is
none.
mr.
yukio
naito
this
is
kahakuloa.
see
that
--
mr.
yukio
naito
it
is
hawaii
in
kauai
your
answer,
your
honor.
well,
this
is
not
a
populated
island.
no
one
lives
there.
mr.
yukio
naito
it
is
located
on
the
island
of
molokai.
mr.
yukio
naito
yes.
there
is
by
statute
a
county
for
this
colony.
however,
for
the
purpose
of
administration
is
included
in
the
county
of
maui.
mr.
yukio
naito
i
don't
know
if
i
have
the
figures
written
by
hand,
your
honor
but
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
yukio
naito
the
administrative
units
generally
confers
in
a
large
area
except
on
the
island
of
oahu.
historically,
for
example,
there
is
a
mountain
range
across
the
island
here
and
historically,
they
have
this
area
hasn't
been
considered
as
an
administrative
district.
mr.
yukio
naito
for
example,
at
the
present
time,
it
has
been
used
as
a
judicial
district.
mr.
yukio
naito
a
judicial
district.
mr.
yukio
naito
because
i
believe
your
honor
that
even
if
it
is
shown
that
the
construction
of
the
various
senatorial
and
representative
districts
maybe
arbitrary,
we
must
still
come
back
to
this
basic
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
has
in
fact
operated
to
cancel
out
or
dilute
the
vote
of
any
voter
and
we
submit
that
there
has
been
no
showing
in
this
respect.
the
other
argument
which
is
made
by
the
governor
is
that
there
is
an
over
representation
of
large
multi-member
districts
to
this
advant
--
to
this
advantage
of
the
single-member
districts.
it
is
said
that
in
a
larger
multi-member
districts,
there's
an
opportunity
for
a
voter
to
have
a
greater
decision
making
influence
because
he
has
that
many
more
legislators
to
look
to.
i
believe,
however,
that
this
court
has
already
answered
that
question
or
that
argument
in
its
case
of
fortson
v.
dorsey
where
it
stated
the
reasons
why
one
district
may
elect
seven
senators,
for
example,
because
in
that
district
has
seven
times
as
many
people
living
in
it
as
in
the
single-member
districts.
and
without
a
showing
that
this
in
effect
operates
to
dilute
the
vote
of
any
voter
that
that
multi-member
districting
system
is
not
unconstitutional.
the
other
argument
which
is
made
by
the
governor
of
hawaii
is
that
there
is
a
submergence
of
minority
in
large
multi-member
districts.
again,
we
submit
your
honor
that
there
has
been
no
evidence
shown
in
the
court
below
of
this
submergence
of
minority.
the
governor
admits
this
in
its
opening
brief.
the
governor
again
admits
it
and
it's
required
too.
however,
the
governor
states
above
all
that
it
is
not
required
that
he
is
not
required
to
show
any
evidence
or
submergence
of
minority.
for
this,
we
dissent
because
we
do
not
believe
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
claimers
of
apportionment
plan
to
prove
that
it
does
not
submerge
minority.
i
believe
that
the
voter
who
is
attacking
the
plan
has
a
burden
to
prove
that
it
dilutes
this
movement
--
his
vote.
the
difficulty
in
following
the
argument
on
submergence
of
minority,
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
determine
who
is
a
minority
or
what
is
a
minority
and
which
minority
is
being
disadvantages
in
a
multi-member
district.
and
we
submit
the
problem
of
a
submergence
of
minority
exists
both
in
--
by
single-member
districts
as
well
as
a
multi-member
districts.
it
is
also
interesting
to
know
in
those
connections
on
submergence
of
minority
that
the
governor
in
its
reply
brief
takes
the
position
that
if
all
of
the
districts
are
equal
in
a
number
of
senators
and
representatives
by
the
districts
elect
then
they
would
not
object
for
the
submergence
of
minority.
we
submit
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
statement
in
their
opening
brief.
mr.
yukio
naito
in
the
reply
brief,
the
governor
makes
the
statement
that
if
all
of
the
districts,
all
of
the
multi-member
districts
elect
an
equal
number
of
representatives
and
senators
that
there
would
be
an
equal
submergence
of
minority
in
all
the
districts
and
therefore,
it
would
not
be
objectionable.
mr.
yukio
naito
i
believe
the
governor
was
addressing
himself
to
multi-member
districts.
mr.
yukio
naito
in
other
words
--
mr.
yukio
naito
that
is
my
dissenting
in
reading
your
supply
brief,
your
honor.
it
appears
your
honor
that
in
the
end,
the
question
of
whether
a
legislature
or
a
constitutional
convention
should
create
multi-member
districts
or
single-member
districts,
this
in
the
judgment
of
that
political
body
so
long
as
the
creation
of
those
districts
would
not
dilute
the
weight
of
the
vote
of
any
voter
in
any
district.
thank
you.
