justice

do
you
think
this
--
do
you
think
that
language
would
make
it
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
apportion
his
legislature
based
on
the
population
over
20
years

i
understand
it
mr.
lyons,
you
--
it's
your
position
that
the
equal
protection
clause
as
construed
in
reynolds
against
sims
in
these
companion
cases
requires
apportionment
to
be
--
a
legislative
apportionment
to
be
upon
the
basis
of
the
resident
population.
but
i
rather
understand
that
you
would
allow
the
state
that
leeway
again
under
if
the
equal
protection
clause
to
define
residence,
is
that
about
it?
justice

or
to
define
generally
the
qualifications
of

it
has
to

hawaii
is
quite
different
in
many
other
ways,
isn't
it?
for
one
thing
it's
several
hundred
thousand
miles
away
from
the

it's
unique
in
that
respect?

another

i
suppose
there's
no

i
â€“
in
other
words,
i'm
simply
suggesting
those
questions
to
ask
whether
it's
the
burden
of
your
present
argument
that
that
since
hawaii,
there
are
only
several
states
that
you
used
registered
voters
is
it
your
thought
that
the
conformity
or
consensus
is
required
per
se
and
just
for
that
reason
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
correctly
that
some
of
these
people,
military
personnel
and
their
dependents
are
registered
voters,
aren't'
they?
justice
potter
stewart
any
other
--
are
there
any
figures
in
your
brief
sort
of
kind
of

what
percentage
of
the
military
establishment
there
and
their
dependents
are

are
registered

of
