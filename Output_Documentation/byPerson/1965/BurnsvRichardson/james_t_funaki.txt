mr.
james
t.
funaki
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
hawaii
has
become
the
united
states
military
bastion
for
the
entire
pacific
and
the
military
population
in
the
state
fluctuates
violently
as
the
asiatic
spots
of
trouble
arise
and
disappear.
now,
this
is
the
manner
in
which
the
district
court
below
characterized
the
fluctuating
and
transient
nature
of
the
military
population
in
hawaii.
and
this
observation
by
the
district
court
underlies
our
position
that
in
hawaii
a
total
population
which
is
given
to
severe
distortion
by
the
fluctuating
military
would
provide
at
best
a
very
distorted
kind
of
an
apportionment
base
for
hawaii,
a
total
population
apportionment
base
with
the
temporary
and
a
very
fleeting
statistic.
i
submit
that
it
would
tend
to
create
rotten
walls
as
it's
happening
currently
with
sudden
troop
movements
from
scorpio
barracks
and
canyon
marine
base
being
shifted
to
vietnam.
because
of
their
transient
status,
many
of
the
military
who
simply
do
not
meet
the
residential
requirement
to
vote
and
because
of
this
large
number
of
nonvoting
military,
coupled
with
the
violent
fluctuations
of
the
military
population
in
hawaii.
the
hawaii
legislature
has
a
very
difficult
time
in
fashioning
an
apportionment
plan
that
would
provide
effective
representation
for
each
citizen
in
the
state.
we
submit
that
the
registered
voter
basis
is
not
only
a
constitutional
permis
--
constitutionally
permissible
basis
but
also
for
hawaii
a
far
more
equitable
basis
in
the
total
population
basis.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
yes,
your
honor.
in
table
9,
pages
exhibit
15
on
the
record
page
388,
--
mr.
james
t.
funaki
--
there
is
a
tabulation
of
the
military
population
in
hawaii
since
1940
i
believe.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
in
any
event,
i
would
like
to
just
pick
out
a
few
of
the
population
figures
to
show
that
fluctuation.
the
military
population
was
407,000
in
1944
and
a
mere
21,000
in
1950.
then
considerable
increase
two
years
later
to
55,000,
then
another
decrease
to
38,000
in
1954,
then
up
again
to
56,000
in
1955,
59,000
in
1960,
and
79,000
in
1962.
now,
this
is
only
considering
the
military
personnel
and
i
believe,
we
have
about
as
much
personnel
on
mili
--
as
much
dependence
as
there
are
military
personnel
so
that
the
fluctuation
elected
here
would
double.
and
so,
we
submit
that
with
such
violent
fluctuations,
a
total
of
military
population
taken
in
an
apportionment
year
would
not
adequately
reflect
the
total
military
population
for
the
whole
apportionment
period.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
this
is
just
a
men
in
uniform.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
no,
not
on
this
--
this
is
just
the
--
any
new
point.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
as
to
the
--
mr.
james
t.
funaki
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
yes,
your
honor
and
i
believe
that
this
is
--
mr.
james
t.
funaki
to
my
knowledge,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
no,
your
honor.
on
the
manner
of
the
registered
voter
basis,
the
district
court
had
found
that
that
registered
voter
basis
was
constitutionally
permissible
in
hawaii
as
it
did
not
operate
to
minimize
or
cancel
out
the
voting
strength
of
any
of
the
voting
population.
the
governor
has
contended
that
the
equal
population
principle
requires
that
sits
in
both
houses
of
a
state
bicameral
legislature
must
be
apportioned
on
a
total
or
gross
population
basis
and
that
the
registered
voter
basis
would
be
permissible
if
and
only
if
it
adequately
reflects
the
total
population.
and
mr.
lyons
in
referring
to
his
points
of
25
on
--
in
his
brief
seems
to
urge
that
this
reflection
be
a
sort
of
a
mathematical
reflection
and
we
would
disagree
with
them
that
there
should
be
any
kind
of
a
mathematical
formula
to
show
that
reflection.
the
brief
of
the
lieutenant
governor
maintains
that
just
the
opposite
is
true
that
the
total
population
must
have
a
stable
and
substantial
relationship
to
the
registered
voter
population
so
that
in
any
event,
the
registered
voter
basis
would
be
permissible
in
hawaii.
now,
the
position
of
the
house
is
that
equal
protection
clause
upon
which
the
equal
population
principle
is
founded
entitles
all
the
people
in
the
state
of
hawaii
to
equal
protection
under
that
clause,
including
that
protection
from
exclusion
from
the
apportionment
base.
but
the
equal
protection
clause
goes
no
further
than
the
invidious
discrimination
so
that
a
state
may
rationally
select
a
particular
apportionment
base
that
would
exclude
and
classify
certain
persons
from
the
apportionment
base.
and
this
court
clearly
acknowledged
the
exclusion
of
aliens
and
wmca
versus
lomenzo
and
also
hinted
that
the
military
might
have
been
excluded
if
more
had
been
shown
than
was
shown
in
davis
versus
mann.
now,
the
federal
census
population
which
the
governor
urges
as
the
proper
basis
for
hawaii
is
also
a
refinement
of
total
population
as
it
excludes
transient
tourists
in
hawaii
and
the
transient
tourists
were
a
substantial
number,
i
believe
they
numbered
about
510,000
in
1964
in
hawaii.
as
used
in
hawaii,
the
registered
voter
basis
would
logically
accomplish
a
refinement
of
the
total
population
so
that
a
fairer
estimate
of
the
total
non-transient
military
and
civilian
population
would
be
obtained.
and
we
feel
that
because
of
the
one
year
residential
requirement,
the
registered
voter
basis
provides
a
rational
means
to
measure
the
transients
from
the
non-transients.
the
military
personnel
and
their
dependents
make
a
significant
impact
on
the
apportionment
of
seats
in
hawaii,
particularly
because
of
their
size,
the
fluctuation,
and
the
temporary
nature
of
their
stay.
as
to
size,
they
constitute
the
military
and
their
defendants
constitute
about
18%
of
the
total
population.
of
the
632,000
total
popu
--
federal
census
population
in
hawaii
in
1960
about
113,000
were
military
depen
--
military
personnel
and
their
dependents.
almost
all
of
them
are
located
on
the
island
of
oahu
and
they
are
--
mr.
james
t.
funaki
yes.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
i
don't
believe
we
have
the
record
for
the
military
dependents,
but
i
believe
the
military
--
the
registration
for
the
military
was
somewhere
in
the
neighbor
of
--
neighborhood
of
about
43%.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
just
a
minute,
let
me
check
that.
on
page
368
of
the
record,
there
is
a
classification
for
military
personnel.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
he
must
have
resided
in
the
islands
for
one
year.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
yes.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
well
there's
a
--
mr.
lyons
was
speaking
earlier
about
the
military
who
lives
on
post
who
has
never
been
a
resident
of
the
--
of
hawaii
before
he
went
on
to
the
post
and
he's
forced
to
live
on
the
post
is
not
eligible
to
become
a
registered
voter.
and
this
is
the
--
mr.
james
t.
funaki
that's
right.
and
this
is
due
to
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
where
--
the
constitution
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
deemed
to
have
gain
or
lost
residence
simply
because
of
his
presence
or
absence
while
employed
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
or
while
engaged
in
navigation
or
whether
a
student
at
any
institution
of
learning
and
the
--
mr.
james
t.
funaki
gained
or
lost,
simply
because
of
his
presence.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
yes
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
--
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
hawaii
has
held
that
in
military
personnel
who
is
force
to
live
on
the
post,
does
not
establish
residence
--
cannot
establish
residence.
mr.
james
t.
funaki
no,
there's
nothing
in
–
there
is
–
there
is
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
there
is
quite
a
bit
in
the
record.
there
is
testimony
by
a
mrs.
lauta,
the
clerk
was
where
the
city
and
county
of
honolulu,
where
she
testified
quite
in
detail
as
to
the
registration
procedures
and
she
has
testified
that
there
has
been
no
discrimination
whatsoever
against
the
military
in
the
registration
procedures.
and
the
district
court
had
found
that
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
hawaii
and
the
statutes
in
no
way
work
to
disfranchise
the
military
personnel
or
their
dependents.
now
returning
to
the
impact
of
the
military
personnel
under
dependence
on
the
apportionment
of
seats
in
hawaii,
i
believe
i
was
explaining
the
concentration
of
the
military
on
the
one
island
of
oahu.
almost
all
of
them
are
concentrated
on
that
island
and
within
a
few
legislative
districts,
they're
all
concentrated.
all
of
the
major
military
installations
are
located
on
the
eighth,
ninth,
tenth,
and
eleventh
representative
districts
which
are
only
four
of
the
eighteen
representative
districts.
so
that
in
any
such
legislative
district,
the
influence
or
the
military
is
quite
profound.
now
size
in
and
of
itself
would
not
be
so
disturbing
as
the
fluctuation
of
the
size
of
military
which
severely
distorts
any
given
total
population
in
hawaii
and
as
we
have
reviewed
earlier,
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
fluctuation
in
the
state
of
hawaii
which
has
disturbed
our
population
picture
in
the
last
25
years.
and
within
recent
months,
as
i
had
earlier
said
that
there
was
about
15,000
men
from
scorpio
barracks
that
were
shipped
over
to
vietnam.
besides
the
mass
movement
of
troops
in
hawaii,
hawaii
serves
as
a
natural
military
transport
station
between
the
continent
of
the
united
states
and
the
countries
in
the
far
east
so
that
it
would
continually
process
incoming
and
outgoing
military
transients
in
large
numbers.
many
of
the
military
who
stay
in
hawaii
are
short
term
personnel,
short
to
as
of
duty
and
a
good
deal
of
them
would
be
merely
serving
out
the
military
draft
obligations
of
two
years
or
less
and
because
of
this
temporary
nature,
they
simply
don't
qualify
to
vote.
and
even
if
they
were
qualified,
many
of
them
would
maintain
their
voting
and
legal
residence
in
their
home
states
and
some
of
them
would
be
indifferent
to
register
if
they
have
any
knowledge
of
their
permanent
transfer
to
another
station
before
the
next
election
in
hawaii.
undoubtedly,
these
are
some
of
the
reasons
which
account
for
the
low
registration
among
the
military.
apportionment
on
the
total
population
basis
would
therefore
strengthen
the
votes
of
those
voters
who
happen
to
reside
in
those
areas
which
are
favored
by
the
presence
of
a
nonvoting
military.
now,
this
can
be
readily
seen
by
comparison
of
the
ninth
and
fourteenth
representative
districts.
each
of
the
ninth
and
fourteenth
representative
districts
in
1960
had
a
federal
census
population
of
42,000.
the
ninth
had
7,000
registered
voters
and
the
fourteenth
had
16,000
registered
voters.
under
the
total
population
basis,
each
district
would
be
entitled
to
three
representative
seats,
but
here
7,000
registered
voters
would
vote
for
three
seats
in
the
ninth
and
16,000
registered
voters
would
vote
for
three
seats
in
the
fourteenth.
now
not
only
would
be
voters
in
the
ninth
district
have
an
advantage
in
this
situation
but
we
submit
that
the
advantage
given
to
the
voters
in
the
ninth
district
would
--
would
frustrate
the
purpose
for
which
an
additional
seat
might
be
given
in
that
district
by
the
inclusion
of
the
nonvoting
military.
because
political
realism
would
have
that
the
voters
in
the
ninth
district
would
vote
for
those
legislators
that
are
responsive
to
their
needs
and
not
to
the
needs
of
the
military
necessarily
and
vice
versa
the
legislators
would
be
responsive
to
those
voters
upon
whom
his
tenure
depends.
as
i
mentioned
earlier
that
there
is
no
discrimination
against
the
military
in
the
way
of
registration
in
hawaii
is
continuing
to
register
the
mili
--
those
of
the
military
who
are
qualified
to
register
to
vote.
the
use
of
the
registered
voter
basis
is
not
to
exclude
the
military
transients
or
civilian
transients
as
an
objective
in
itself.
we
feel
that
it
is
a
necessary
step
to
obtain
a
stable
and
reliable
apportionment
base
for
a
more
effective
representation
system.
the
use
of
the
registered
voter
basis
need
not
be
in
every
respect
logically
consistent
with
its
aims
to
be
constitutional
and
we
submit
that
it
would
be
enough
if
hawaii
recognizes
that
there
is
a
problem
with
the
fluctuating
military
and
the
civilian
transients
and
that
the
use
of
the
registered
voter
basis
might
be
thought
as
one
rational
way
to
solve
hawaii's
problem.
