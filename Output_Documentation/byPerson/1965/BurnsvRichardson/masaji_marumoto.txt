mr.
masaji
marumoto
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
full
residents
of
the
ten
districts
[inaudible]
and
one
residence
of
the
fifteenth
district.
our
main
purpose
in
starting
the
suit
was
to
bring
about
the
break
up
of
the
stranglehold
of
the
outer
islands
in
the
senate.
this
will
be
accomplished
by
the
affirmance
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
however,
it
will
be
an
expensive
affair.
now,
the
plaintiffs
have
not
appealed
so
to
speak
against
it,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
maybe
unanimous,
but
i
may
state
the
reason
that
why
--
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
appeal
is
that
until
the
--
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
we
did
not
have
funds
to
print
the
record
or
to
pay
for
the
printing
of
the
briefs.
now
on
this
appeal,
the
position
that
the
plaintiffs
state
that
we
agree
with
the
district
court
in
stating
that
registered
voter
basis
is
a
proper
base.
and
also,
multi-member
districts
in
both
houses
are
permissible
and
i
agree
with
mr.
dodge
that
the
permanent
apportionment
should
go
into
effect
in
1968.
however,
there
should
be
a
temporary
apportionment
for
the
1966
apportionment
so
that
at
least
in
--
in
1966
there
is
--
there
will
be
--
there
may
not
be
a
perfect
apportionment
but
still
in
apportionment
that
is
better
than
which
is
existing
at
the
present
time.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
i
agree
with
that
and
then
i
may
--
i
may
enter
certain
questions.
assuming
that
the
registered
voter
basis
is
a
correct
basis
or
an
acceptable
basis,
assuming
that
the
multi-member
districting
of
the
house
of
representatives
is
constitutional
then
i
think
it
is.
and
assuming
that
the
multi-member
district
can
be
done
by
this
last
legislature
is
also
constitutional,
i
think
it
is.
what
can
be
done
is
this?
under
the
hawaii
constitution,
legislature
may
propose
constitutional
amendment.
now
the
senatorial
plan,
in
order
to
propose
a
constitutional
amendments
by
the
legislature,
it
maybe
passed
by
two-thirds
vote
in
one
session
or
a
majority
of
vote
in
two
sessions.
now
the
pertinent
senate
apportionment
plan
has
been
adopted
at
the
last
session.
legislatures
in
session
know
if
it
passes
the
bill
at
this
session,
it
would
have
been
passed
by
the
legislature
in
two
consecutive
sessions.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
it
can
as
an
urgent
measure
and
no
question
it
is
an
urgent
measure.
in
order
to
get
into
the
calendar
as
an
urgent
measure,
they
must
be
approved
by
two-thirds
of
the
legislature
and
i
think
the
legislature
will.
then
the
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
that
is
right.
then
it
can
go
to
the
november
election.
also
in
the
last
session,
the
legislature
passed
a
bill
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
a
question
as
to
whether
there
shall
be
a
constitutional
session
convention
has
already
been
passed.
it
will
be
on
the
1966
election
ballot,
that
question
will
be
on.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
there
will
be
two,
two
questions.
one,
shall
there
be
a
convention,
that
will
be
a
definitely
on
regardless
of
what
the
legislature
have
done
at
this
session
because
that
question
had
been
adopted
in
the
last
session.
then,
if
this
session
passes,
a
legislative
recommendation
or
plan
for
apportionment,
that
will
go
on
the
november
--
the
election
january
election
for
adoption
by
the
electorate.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
yes.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
that
is
right
and
if
the
voters
reject
that
question,
the
plan
proposed
by
the
legislature
and
if
it
passes
the
other
question,
shall
there
be
a
convention?
there
will
be
a
convention
anyway,
but
again,
the
electorate
may
have
vote
for
both
questions,
then
there
will
be
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
there
will
be
constitutional
convention
anyway
and
then
one
--
one
problem
about
limiting
the
constitutional
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
that
is
right
and
one
difficulty
with
having
a
constitutional
convention
is
under
our
constitution,
the
agenda
of
the
constitutional
convention
cannot
be
limited
so
that
the
convention
may
go
all
over
the
creation.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
that
is
right.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
the
statute
which
creates
the
constitutional
convention,
under
our
constitutional
--
under
the
provision
states
that
it
maybe
the
same
number
as
in
the
1952
convention
or
the
legislature
which
creates
--
which
calls
for
this
convention
may
adopt
a
different
apportionment.
and
that
is
why
i
do
think
that
there
should
be
a
temporary
apportionment
for
the
november
election
so
that
the
stranglehold
of
the
outer
islands
in
the
creation
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
yes.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
yes.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
the
legislature
act.
the
legislature
act
and
there
should
--
there
has
to
be
election
of
the
delegates.
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
that
will
be
under
article
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
it
has
not
yet
been
decided.
now,
the
constitution
says,
“unless
the
legislature
shall
otherwise
provide
there
shall
be
the
same
number
of
delegates
to
such
convention
who
shall
be
elected
from
the
same
areas
and
the
convention
shall
be
convening
the
same
manner
as
merely
as
practical
vote
as
required
in
the
hawaii
state
constitutional
convention
of
1950”
and
then
there's
another
provision
which
says
the
legislature
may
provide
some
other
apportionment.
now,
the
legislature
will
be
meeting
next
annually
anyway,
the
legislature
in
1967
will
be
a
general
session
for
all
purposes.
that
can
provide
the
all
of
the
statutory
requirement
apportionment
in
the
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
no.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
no.
that
is
--
if
the
legislature
does
not
provide
for
the
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
no.
it
has
to
consider
any
problem
that
may
come
up.
and
however,
if
the
convention
is
held
next
year,
i
believe
there
will
be
sufficient
time
for
the
legis
--
the
convention
to
consider
all
the
other
problems
it
may
want
to
consider
and
it
is
about
time
a
convention
would
--
should
be
held
because
this
first
reconvention
was
held
in
1952,
in
the
meantime,
hawaii
has
become
a
state,
we
have
not
had
a
convention
since
then.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
i
think
so.
now
on
this
question
of
registered
voters,
this
court
has
already
decided
in
wmca
versus
lomenzo,
384
that
citizen
basis
can
be
a
deviation
from
the
population
basis.
now
in
the
six
reapportionment
cases
of
1964
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
that
for
capital
equality
of
representation
maybe
measured
either
by
voters
or
total
population
and
i
wish
--
i
agree
with
that
contention
that
it
maybe
by
voters
or
total
population
and
in
the
situation
in
hawaii
that
registered
voters
maybe
a
substitute
for
voter
population
and
for
this
reason,
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
the
military
population.
i
have
stated
on
page
15
of
my
brief
set
forth
certain
figures.
however,
it
is
not
complete
and
if
this
is
to
be
complete,
i
think
we
should
--
mr.
masaji
marumoto
on
page
15
of
my
brief.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
i
have
adverted
to
the
tenth
district
and
the
eleventh
district
only
and
main
district
have
about
all
the
military
installation
which
kept
the
[inaudible]
in
these
districts
and
then
it
went
on.
however,
[inaudible]
as
they
have
found
out
is
in
the
length
show
that
statement
isn't
accurate.
however,
if
we
include
this
eight,
nine,
ten,
and
eleven,
it
will
practically
include
100%
of
the
military
population.
now
on
page
--
i
think
at
394,
the
--
it's
in
exhibit
15,
one
of
the
exhibits
there,
showed
that
the
military
population
of
the
other
islands
in
1960
was
only
339
out
of
50,000
and
practically
all
of
the
military
population,
is
within
11,
all
these
blue
areas
are
military
in
the
end
where
he
[inaudible]
and
pearl
harbor
is
in
the
ninth
[inaudible]
and
in
the
eighth
where
kauai
has
naval
stations.
now
if
we
add
the
total
population
including
the
military
of
those
four
districts,
it
comes
out
to
263,958.
on
the
basis
of
total
population,
the
number
of
legislatures,
they
would
be
entitled
to
these
four
districts
would
be
22
and
under
the
registered
voter
basis,
it
would
be
fourteen.
now,
according
to
1960
census,
the
total
population
was
632,000.
mr.
masaji
marumoto
all
over
the
island.
so
if
you
divide
that
by
51
and
average
population
who
represented
it,
it
is
12,407.
if
you
multiply
by
14,
that
is
the
number
of
legislators
assigned
to
those
four
areas
under
the
registered
voter
basis,
these
14
representatives
would
be
representing
173,698
people
--
persons,
so
that
the
unrepresented
population
will
be
90,206.
now
in
1960,
there
was
a
military
population
of
50,000
and
this
is
all
in
the
record
and
military
dependent
population
of
62,000,
making
112,000.
so
that
if
there
are
90,000
unrepresented
population,
then
90,000
may
account
--
maybe
accounted
for
by
the
military.
there
will
be
another
20
--
3000,
20,000
or
so.
now
many
of
the
60,000
military
dependents,
being
whites
and
so
forth
will
not
register.
so
that
if
these
things
have
taken
into
consideration,
registered
voter
basis
will
put
in
nearly
equal
or
be
equivalent
to
the
total
population.
now
under
the
hawaii
organic
act,
before
hawaii
became
a
state
or
before
the
constitutional
convention,
reapportionment
was
--
to
be
based
on
citizen
population.
we
cannot
get
citizen
population
because
the
federal
census
does
not
provide
for
that.
as
i
understand
it,
in
new
york,
some
--
some
special
compensation
is
paid
to
the
census
bureau
to
get
citizen
population.
the
only
way
right
now
to
get
citizen
population
in
hawaii
is
to
deduct
from
the
total
population,
the
population
of
aliens
as
reported
to
the
immigration
service.
but
we
cannot
have
citizen
population
figures
by
the
election
districts.
that
is
the
difficulty
we
have
in
citizen
population
basis.
now
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
i
understand
it,
classification
can
be
done
and
in
this
particular
case,
if
it's
--
it
is
done
on
a
rational
basis
with
regard
to
the
objective
of
objective
which
the
apportionment
is
supposed
to
serve,
then
it
would
be
a
constitutional
classification
and
i
think
a
registered
voter
basis
in
the
case
of
hawaii
is
a
constitutional
classification.
one
decision,
butcher
versus
carr
has
definitely
decided
that
the
registered
voter
basis
in
vermont
is
constitutional
because
not
come
up
to
this
court
because
it
has
not
been
appealed
but
judge
waterman
decided
there
that
although
he
decided
that
voter
basis
in
new
york
was
unconstitutional,
he
decided
that
the
elected
--
the
registered
voter
basis
in
vermont
was
constitutional
because
in
new
york
the
voter
basis
situation
was
used
as
a
ghost
or
a
continuation
of
prior
malapportionment.
but
in
--
in
vermont,
he
found
that
there
was
nothing
invidious
about
the
use
of
registered
voter
basis.
now,
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
multi-member
districting,
this
court
has
stated
that
the
constitutional
standard
should
be
developed
on
case
by
case
basis.
and
as
mr.
justice
brennan
read
this
one
decision,
first
decision
today,
other
points,
certain
standards
have
to
be
decided
on
case
by
case
basis,
on
case
by
case
basis,
we
have
already
this
situation.
in
colorado,
the
city
and
county
of
denver,
as
18
out
of
65
representatives
and
nine
out
of
35
representatives.
in
toombs
versus
fortson,
fulton
county
has
24
representatives
out
of
205
and
it
has
a
multi
--
seven-district
county
where
seven
senators
are
elected
from
one
county.
davis
versus
cameron
in
iowa
turned
down
the
objection
that
it
was
malapportioned
because
11
representatives
were
elected
from
fulton
county.
in
buckley
versus
hoff,
15
representatives
out
of
50,
just
from
one
district,
16
senators
out
of
30
is
from
one
district,
mann
versus
davis.
henrico
county
and
richmond
where
a
lot
of
eight
representatives
in
the
senate,
richmond
has
two,
henrico
has
one.
i
particularly
wish
to
refer
to
mann
versus
davis
because
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
district
court
held
the
districting
of
the
county
of
hawaii
into
one
senatorial
district
with
three
senators
instead
of
two
districts,
with
one
senator
and
two
senators
was
gerrymandering
in
order
to
preserve
the
position
of
the
senators
who
were
elected
from
the
other
district.
now
the
explanation
in
the
record
and
we
got
to
take
that
explanation
because
there
is
no
rebuttal
of
that
explanation
is
this.
in
the
first
district,
the
registered
voter
population
was
7000.
the
ideal
population
is
9,500.
the
total
registered
population
is
28,000.
you
will
deduct
28,000,
7000
from
28,000
and
that
would
make
it
21,000.
so
two
senators
from
the
hilo
area
will
be
representing
10,500
registered
voters,
while
senator
from
this
district
here,
the
[inaudible]
would
be
representing
7,000.
the
explanation
by
the
senator
who
testified
was
they
wanted
to
be
equalize.
so
that
instead
of
the
dividing,
they
made
through
one
district
of
the
three
senators
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
mann
versus
davis.
the
city
of
richmond
had
the
enough
population
for
five
representatives
but
not
enough
for
six,
henrico
had
enough
for
two,
but
not
enough
for
three.
so
they
combined
the
two
and
made
it
into
a
multi-member
district
of
eight.
with
regard
to
excluding
minority
representation,
again,
i
refer
to
mann
versus
davis
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
burnette
versus
davis
in
382
page
42.
and
there
a
resident,
a
colored
resident
of
richmond
stated
that,
it
was
unconstitutional
because
if
richmond
were
divided
into
five
districts
in
certain
areas,
covered
representative
could
be
chosen
but
if
it
were
combined
together,
with
richmond
and
henrico
with
it,
the
covered
population
would
be
reduced,
percentage
would
be
reduced
from
42%
to
29%
and
the
chances
of
covered
representative
being
elected
would
be
much
less.
probably
in
a
situation
that
the
governor's
representative
stated
about
the
waikiki
district.
however,
i
think
it
has
--
the
trend
has
already
been
started
on
case
by
case
method,
the
delineation
of
standard
that
multi-member
districts
are
constitutional.
if
multi-member
district
is
constitutional
for
the
house,
and
then
for
the
senate
also,
then,
the
person
who
comes
apportionment
maybe
approved
the
senate
apportionment
that
was
adopted
maybe
approved
the
legislature
made
by
a
majority
of
vote
if
they
cannot
get
the
two-thirds
vote
approve
the
senate
measures
the
fast
draft
session,
put
it
on
the
calendar
on
the
november
election.
and
then
for
the
november
election,
however,
i
believe
there
should
be
a
temporary
apportionment
on
the
same
basis
that
the
legislature
passed
last
year
which
would
give
oahu
its
number
of
senators
which
is
19
to
which
it
is
entitled.
and
then
the
reapportion
legislature
can
enact
a
bill
for
the
calling
of
the
constitutional
convention
with
proper
apportionment
for
members
of
the
convention.
