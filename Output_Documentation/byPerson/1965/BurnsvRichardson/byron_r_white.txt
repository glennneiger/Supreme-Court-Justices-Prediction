justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lyons,
let
--
i
gather
that
you
thought
that
the
eight
states
could
exclude
from
registering
a
military
people
on
suitable
grounds
such
as
residence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright,
let's
assume
they
can
--
assume
they
can,
could
you
--
does
this
record
have
the
information
in
it
to
show
what
difference
it
would
make
as
to
whether
you
had
population
or
registered
--
registered
voters
as
a
basis,
if
hawaii
did
exclude
those
military
people
from
registering
that
they
--
that
legally
excludes?
i
mean,
you
just
--
you
say
that
--
that
only
thirty-seven
and
a
half
percent
of
the
population
can
elect
the
house
of
the
senate
whatever
it
is
you're
talking
about
but
that
thirty-seven
and
a
half
percent
--
is
thirty-seven
and
a
half
percent
of
the
population
including
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
honolulu
and
if
hawaii
could
exclude
and
did
exclude
those
military
people
if
they
--
if
they
could,
does
this
record
indicates
what
the
situation
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
record
--
so
the
record
doesn't
show
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
gather
--
i
gather
you
would
say
then
that
that
it
is
not
your
burden
but
the
state's
burden.
say
that
if
you're
going
to
use
registered
voters
or
if
they're
going
to
exclude
military
that
it's
their
burden
to
indicate
on
what
grounds
they're
excluding
military
and
they
haven't
done
anything
yet?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can
see
that
it's
conceivable
and
in
equal
protection
case,
it's
not
--
it's
not
unusual
to
talk
about
some
conceivable
ground
for
the
state
action
and
the
state
could
say
that
we're
taking
care
of
the
military
people
through
the
registration
device
and
we
do
exclude
a
lot
of
military
from
registering
and
that's
our
way
of
doing
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
record
does
demonstrate
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
added
--
and
your
position
would
be
that
that
part
of
this
record
in
itself
is
sufficient
to
upset
the
registered
voter
basis
from
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
what
if
the
state
did
say
that
look
this
registered
voter's
basis
has
consequence
of
adequately
excluding
from
the
vote
those
military
people
that
we're
entitled
to
exclude
and
the
military
people
aside
the
registered
voter's
basis
would
give
the
same
apportionment
as
a
--
as
their
population
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
alien
population?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
census
figures
--
the
census
figures
reflect
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
--
those
also
are
the
people
who
are
in
the
military
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
--
the
census
figures
wouldn't
reflect
--
the
census
figures
include
all
the
people
who
live
on
military
bases
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
tell
whether
they
live
on
a
military
base
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
military
areas
there
are
military
enclaves
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
to
what
extent
--
what
is
it
this
contrary
jurisdiction
over
time
or
on
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
legislature
doesn't
have
the
civil
legislative
authority
of
the
districts
that
they
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
this
considered
to
be
--
are
the
military
reservations
considered
to
be
part
of
the
state
of
hawaii
or
part
of
the
united
states
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
hawaii
it
says
here
anyone
who
is
a
resident
who
is
actually
living
on
a
military
base
cannot
register
even
though
he
says
on
that
i
am
--
i
reside
to
be
here.
this
is
my
permanent
--
i
live
in
hawaii
there
all
the
rest
of
my
life,
this
is
exactly
where
i
am
going
to
live.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
both
the
house
--
are
both
the
house
and
the
senate
districts
related
into
those
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
different
ways
but
they
are
related.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
what
--
for
what
purposes
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dodge,
what
--
how
are
your
--
how
is
the
registered
voter
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
how
many
registered
voters
there
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
permanent
register
--
you
have
permanent
register.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
often
do
you
purge?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
often
do
you
purge
your
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
for
purposes
that
what
if
you
don't
vote?
but
what
if
the
person
dies
and
hence
doesn't
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
--
how
do
you
tell
then
how
many
registered
voters
were
are
actually
alive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
quite
a
few
people
die
every
year?
then
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
--
how
does
it
go
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
have
a
purge
every
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
really
--
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
registered
voters
is
not
your
major
at
all.
it's
the
actual
voters.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
no,
it's
a
number
and
because
if
you
haven't
voted,
you're
off
the
list.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
you're
--
so
what
you're
saying
is
if
actual
voter
is
a
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
say
there's
no
difference
between
registered
voters
and
actual
voters
because
if
you
don't
register
--
if
you
don't
vote,
you're
off
to
registration
list
which
just
leaves
the
registered
voters
who
voted.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
difference
between
the
two
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if
you're
talking
about
--
you're
talking
about
the
percentage
of
voters
who
are
registered
voters
who
are
alive
to
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
often
is
the
--
is
the
apportionment
basis
be
determined?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
10
years?
so
you're
really
talking
about
the
--
the
registered
voters
on
the
first
day
of
the
year,
is
that
it?
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
talking
about
the
ones
who
are
eligible
to
vote
of
that
general
election
where
the
people
actually
voted
the
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
ones
you
would
carry
though
are
the
ones
who
voted
in
the
last,
preceding
elections.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
district
court
below
is
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
district
court
was
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
has
an
act
of
plan
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
any
reference
to
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
mean
that
as
of
now,
one
it
stayed
effect
until
the
early
of
1958.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
the
legislative
election
this
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
--
let's
assume
that
the
court
accepted
the
registered
voter
basis,
accepted
the
multi-member
district.
well
let's
assume
the
court
here
agreed
in
all
respects
from
the
district
court.what
should
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
court
thought
that
registered
voters
was
a
matter
of
the
basis
for
apportionment
that
the
multi-member
districts
were
all
right
and
that
the
plan
to
vote
by
the
legislature
was
alright
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
order
that
--
in
order
that
the
legislature
that
would
be
dealing
with
--
that
would
be
proposing
a
constitutional
amendment
or
a
legislature
that
would
be
convening
in
constitutional
convention
would
be
the
legislature
elected
in
the
district
interim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
it
--
could
it
pass
it
at
a
budget
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
sorry.
i'm
a
little
confused.
if
--
if
this
legislature,
the
majority
votes
as
to
getting
in
the
calendar
by
two-thirds,
does
what
the
last
legislature
did
in
the
[inaudible]
apportionment
plan.
what
goes
on
the
valid
in
november?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
--
what
about
the
composition
of
the
convention
is
that
of
the
same
basis
on
just
how
to
present
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
--
this
particular
--
this
matter
of
the
constitutional
convention
--
when
is
the
--
let's
assume
that
this
is
--
this
constitutional
convention
matter
is
passed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
is
adopted
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
is
followed.
then
will
--
it'll
have
to
be
implemented
by
--
by
a
legislative
act
or
had
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
hasn't
already
been
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
sure
legislate
your
hawaii
legislature
has
not
yet
provided
for
the
composition
of
the
convention
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
maybe
approved.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
--
and
if
it
does,
do
something
in
the
january
1967
session,
as
i
understood
you,
what
it
does
cannot
include
a
limitation
to
consideration
by
the
convention
only
of
apportionment.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
all
over
the
island.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lyons,
if
--
if
--
what
if
we
disagreed
with
you,
you
have
to
show
what
--
what
if
we
suggest
that
you
have
the
burden
showing
what
was
wrong
with
the
--
having
a
display.
what
would
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what's
wrong
within
--
in
a
consistent
pattern
as
such
--
just
because
when
district
start
creating
another
two
and
another
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
wrong
--
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
court
has
said
that
it's
inherently
arbitrary
for
one
person
to
be
represented
by
one
congressman
and
--
or
one
representative
and
another
person
to
be
represented
by
six?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
have
said
is
that
there
are
various
districts
and
various
members
of
representatives
(voice
overlap)
arbitrary?
