mr.
robert
g.
dodge
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
lieutenant
governor,
who
is
the
defendant
in
these
three
appeals,
supports
the
district
court's
decision
not
only
gets
point.
we
feel
that
registered
voters
particularly
in
hawaii
but
i'll
make
it
broad
on
that.
we
think
that
registered
voters
must
be
the
starting
point.
we
think
that
the
court
was
correct
in
approving
the
multi-member
districts
that
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
honolulu.
we
think
that
the
court
was
absolutely
correct
in
holding
that
the
various
district
boundaries
for
the
house
of
representatives
had
historical,
and
political,
and
traditional
basis
and
we're
not
arbitrary
or
capricious.
we
are
convinced
that
the
court
was
correct
in
denying
the
legislature
of
hawaii
any
some
kind
of
plenary
or
inherent
power
to
amend
the
constitution
by
setting
up
even
a
temporary
plan
for
reapportionment
pending
the
amendment
of
our
state
constitution.
we
think
that
the
court
was
probably
right
in
1965
in
adhering
to
what
apparently
was
the
1966
general
election
deadline
set
by
this
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
certain
other
cases,
although,
i
must
admit
i
have
some
doubts
as
to
whether
that
is
a
practical
deadline
of
hawaii
today
because
of
the
time
taken
to
bring
it
before
this
court.
we
think
that
the
circuit
–
that
the
district
court
had
to
have
the
authority
to
enter
an
order
enjoining
the
legislature
from
doing
any
other
acts
until
it
cured
the
reapportionment
system.
we
don't
know
how
a
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutional
role
in
carrying
out
the
federal
constitutions
can
avoid
sometimes
making
orders
to
legislature
to
do
the
job
that
federal
constitution
requires.
and
we
think
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
rejecting
as
its
own
plan,
the
plan
proposed
to
it
by
the
legislature
of
hawaii
i‘m
not
going
to
touch
on
all
of
these
points
but
i
--
there
are
a
couple
of
i
think
very
important
ones,
i
think
probably
the
most
important
point
involved
in
these
cases
is
whether
or
not
what
this
court
meant
when
it
used
the
term
population
in
the
reapportionment
decisions
in
1964.
and
i
need
to
find
out
what
the
court
probably
had
in
mind
or
rather
what
it
meant,
was
to
find
out
what
kind
of
a
constitutional
problem
we
do
have
here.
we
are
being
--
the
court
is
being
asked
by
the
governor
to
embark
on
an
entirely
new
course
of
action,
new
course
of
constitutional
law
it
seems
to
me,
asking
the
court
to
say
that
there's
some
constitutional
right
to
be
represented
in
a
legislative
body.
this
court
hasn't
yet
said
that.
all
this
court
has
said
in
all
of
the
cases
involving
voting,
well
it
said
more
than
just
a
little,
it
said
quite
a
bit.
it
said
there
in
one
several
cases,
it
is
recognized
that
there's
no
federal
right
to
a
voter
to
be
a
voter
that
this
is
solely
within
the
realm
of
the
states.
it
has
said
that
a
state
may
set
up
any
qualifications
for
voters
as
long
as
they
don't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
previous
condition
of
servitude,
sex,
and
whatever
else
is
involved
in
these
things.
but
as
long
as
the
state's
registration
laws
and
machinery
as
such
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
two
amendments
of
the
cons
--
of
the
constitution.
they
may
set
any
reasonable
voting
requirement
that
there
is
and
i
suppose
that
a
state
could
say
that
voters
could
only
register
to
vote
after
they
attain
the
age
of
35
or
40.
we
already
have
in
our
states
the
difference
in
the
voting
age
requirement
for
it
happens
to
be
20.
i
think
georgia
is
18
and
i
think
washington
is
21.
so
there's
no
magic
in
this
and
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
the
state
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
determine
the
qualifications
for
their
own
voters.
so
what
are
we
protecting
in
these
cases?
we're
not
protecting
any
individual
who
can't
vote.
we're
saying
and
i
think
this
court
is
saying
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
the
other
one,
all
of
them,
that
when
a
person
has
qualified
as
a
voter,
when
he
has
a
vote
by
the
state's
machinery,
this
court
is
going
to
be
certain
under
the
equal
protection
clause
that
that
vote
of
his
is
going
to
be
worth
as
much
as
any
other
person's
vote.
now
i
think
we're
going
beyond
that.
i
don't
think
we've
recognize,
i
don't
think
this
court
should
recognize
because
i
don't
think
it
exists
any
right
to
be
represented
because
i
am
a
person
living
in
the
state.
i
suggest
perhaps
the
way
to
resolve
this
thing
is
to
look
at
the
question
of
standing
and
i
--
i
suggest
a
couple
of
questions.
what
would
a
federal
court
--
federal
district
court
do
if
an
inmate
of
hawaii
prison
or
new
york
state
prison
convicted
of
a
felony
came
in
and
objected
because
his
civil
rights
were
being
abused
or
his
equal
protection
--
protection
was
being
abused
because
he
was
not
getting
proper
representation
in
the
hawaii
or
new
york
legislature.
what
if
a
child
came
in,
even
with
a
guardian
ad
litem
or
a
transient
tourist
who
was
in
hawaii
for
the
term
of
a
legislative
session,
a
transient
military
person
or
even
i
submit
a
person
20
years
old,
a
legal
resident
of
hawaii
who
hadn't
taken
the
pains
to
register
to
vote,
would
he
have
standing
to
raise
the
constitutional
question?
and
i
submit
that
he
would
not
because
the
--
the
court
i
think
in
baker
versus
carr
identified
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
there
as
having
a
substantial
interest
to
protect
and
that
interest,
this
court
found
was
his
interest
as
a
voter
and
i
think
we're
treading
dangerous
ground
if
we
go
beyond
that
constitutional
protection
and
that
is
why
i
suggest
that
the
district
court
was
absolutely
right
in
holding
that
registered
voters
in
hawaii
was
proper
because
every
registered
voter
in
hawaii
has
almost
precisely
the
same
interest
in
every
representative
in
the
house
of
representatives.
the
method
of
equal
proportions
is
the
fairest
mechanical
and
mathematical
system
to
apportioned
members
who
have
given
a
certain
base.
so
there
is
a
table
in
the
--
in
the
brief
some
--
in
the
lieutenant
governor's
brief
on
table
--
page
14
which
shows
that
the
range
between
votes
and
representatives
of
the
18
representative
districts
is
something
like
one
to
2,209
to
one
to
3,500
and
3,797.
now,
you
just
simply
can't
get
closer
than
that
in
doing
arithmetic.
it
can't
be
done.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
in
terms
of
how
can
a
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
because
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
central
--
each
county
registers
to
voters.
there
are
four
counties
as
you
have
heard.
each
county
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
yes
we
do.
well
i
put
it
--
i
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
pardon?
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
actually,
we
have
permanent
registration
if
you
vote
in
each
general
election.
if
you
fail
to
vote
in
a
general
election,
you
must
then
re-register.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
if
the
person
dies
between
general
election
he
is
still
on
--
on
the
role
after
his
death
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
you
--
i
don't
suppose
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
that's
--
that's
true.
that's
true.
but
as
i
say
if
you
have
not
voted
in
a
general
election,
your
name
goes
off.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
it's
--
it's
taken
off
because
there
is
a
--
there's
a
cross
checking
system,
a
card
file
so
that
you
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
yes.
every
general
election,
those
who
have
not
voted
in
that
general.
they
don't
have
to
vote
in
the
primary
but
if
they
have
not
voted
in
the
general
action,
they're
taken
off
to
the
roll.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
we
call
it
registered
voters
and
it's
--
it's
making
a
number
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
that's
--
that's
--
that's
true,
when
you're
not
counted
as
a
registered
voter.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
the
constitution
doesn't
really
say
that
the
--
there
was
the
debate
in
the
constitutional
convention
as
to
whether
to
take
total
population
or
to
take
registered
voters
or
to
take
votes
cast
for
the
governor
in
the
last
general
election
and
it
was
decided
that
the
most
current
figure
that
you
could
get
would
be
registered
voter.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
i
suppose
that
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
that
actual
voters
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
certainly,
the
comparison
between
registered
voters
and
actual
voters
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
89%
and
92%
of
our
voters
actually
vote,
and
our
registered
voters
actually
vote
in
hawaii.
it's
an
extremely
high
percentage.
we
not
only
have
a
high
percentage
of
eligible
voters
who
register
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
i'm
sorry
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
how
many
there
might
be
who
had
died
between
general
elections
and
would
still
be
a
registered
voter
until
the
end
of
the
elections.
as
soon
as
that
section
election,
that
--
that
next
election
comes
along,
they're
off
the
roll.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
every
10
years.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
we're
talking
about
the
number
of
registered
voters
of
the
general
election
preceding
the
time
that
the
governor
--
in
hawaii
the
apportionment
is
a
ministerial
act
by
the
governor
every
10
years
and
we're
talking
then
about
the
previous
general
election
registration
of
statistics.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
we're
talking
about
the
total
number
that
was
carried
under
personal
roles
as
being
registered
to
vote
for
that
general
election.
we're
not
talking
about
the
number
to
that
to
be
voted.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
yes,
that's
right.
i
might
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
you
could
register
the
day
after
the
election.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
we
have
a
table
in
--
in
--
it
appears
with
the
last
--
the
next
to
the
last
page,
it's
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
no,
it's
intervener's
plaintiffs
exhibit
go4,
appearing
on
page
409
of
the
printed
record.
on
page
410,
there
were
230
in
--
and
i
was
speaking
of
the
--
of
the
tuesday,
november
3,
1964
general
election.
there
were
239,361
voters
registered;
214,694
of
them
actually
voted.
the
percentage
in
the
excess
of
--
i
got
it
in
my
brief
i
think
almost
89%
and
i
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
no,
to
reapportion
--
to
reapportion.
let's
say
we
were
to
reapportion.
let's
say
we
were
to
reapportion
in
1966,
we
would
use
239,361
as
the
starting
point
and
then
of
course
the
figures
within
that
line
give
you
those
from
each
of
the
other
--
each
of
the
registration
history.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice
is
not
that
you
might
get
the
same
situation.
i
can
find
nothing
constitutionally
protected
in
the
total
population
concept
where
i
--
where
i
do
find
it
protected
in
the
registered
voter
concept
and
particularly
in
hawaii
where
we
do
have
this
transient
military
population
that
mr.
funaki
spoke
of
and
where
the
lower
court
found
this
to
be
a
substantial
reason
to
avoid
the
total
population
even
--
i
say
in
--
i
say
in
our
brief
or
we
do
that
total
population
is
valid
only
if
by
its
use
you
would
reach
an
apportionment
substantially
equivalent
to
what
you
would
reach
on
a
registered
voter
basis.
i'm
180
degrees
off
from
--
from
the
governor's
position
because
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
there's
yet
any
constitutional
right
to
be
represented
as
such,
as
people
with
inmates
and
children
and
transients,
and
things
like
this.
we're
talking
about
our
own
state.
we're
talking
about
our
own
state
policies
and
if
we
take
total
population
which
would
include
military
population,
we
then
make
the
internal
affairs
of
the
state
of
hawaii
completely
--
well
substantially
at
the
mercy
of
international
conflict
over
which
we
and
hawaii
have
no
control.
as
for
--
pardon.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
i
don't
think
it
does
have
to
include
it.
but
i
--
in
--
i
can't
see
that
the
man
who
was
an
eligible
voter
who
has
not
taken
the
pains
to
register
or
to
vote,
i
cannot
see
how
he
had
standing
to
raise
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well
this
isn't
my
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well
certainly
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
they
have
--
they
have
--
they
have
an
interest.
they
have
a
right
to
petition
their
government
for
their
grievances,
but
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
be
represented,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out.
at
least
so
far
this
court
had
not
said
so.
and
so
i
think
the
district
court
was
absolutely
correct
in
saying
that
in
hawaii
registered
voters
is
constitutionally
permissible.
the
record
is
clear
also
that
you
found
that
they,
they
three
judges,
found
the
--
the
districts
to
be
historically
situated
old
land
divisions,
old
administrative
judicial
areas,
old
school
district
lines.
and
this
court
certainly
has
not
seen
anything
invidious
about
multiple
election
districts.
one
other
point
i
want
to
mention
briefly
is
that
both
the
state
supreme
court
in
an
earlier
case,
involving
reapportionment
decided
in
august
of
1964
and
the
federal
district
court
held
that
the
only
way
that
the
apportionment
of
the
senate
could
be
changed
in
hawaii
was
by
constitutional
amendment.
now,
the
governor
is
asking
you
here,
the
house
of
the
senate
is
asking
you
to
somehow
vest
the
hawaii
legislature
an
authority
to
at
least
temporarily
amend
our
constitution
and
i
not
only
ask
you
not
to
do
it,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
any
jurisdiction
to
do
it.
i
think
you
were
bound
to
accept
the
interpretation
of
hawaii's
constitution
given
to
it
by
the
state
of
hawaii
supreme
court.
they
have
said
that
they
have
denied
any
legislative
inherent,
implicit
plenary
or
any
other
kind
of
power
to
our
legislature
in
hawaii
because
the
constitution
clearly
takes
--
removes
the
legislature
completely
from
the
picture
and
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
this
court
must
accept
that
as
i
think
you
accepted
the
decision
of
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
--
in
the
case
that
came
up
from
maryland
where
you
said
presumably
the
maryland
legislature
has
this
authority
because
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
says
that
it
had.
we
have
never
--
we
had
under
the
old
territorial
organic
act,
legislative
apportionment
as
the
function
of
the
legislature,
but
they
failed
for
60
years
to
50
years
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
so
the
delegates
to
the
convention,
the
legislature,
and
the
people
of
hawaii
in
approving
it
and
congress
would
approve
it,
completely
took
our
legislature
out
of
the
apportionment
function
at
all.
and
i
don't
think
this
court
--
i
don't
think
that
the
district
court
and
certainly
i'm
sure
that
the
state
of
hawaii
supreme
court
could
not
grant
our
legislature
the
power
that
the
people
have
not
granted
to
them.
this
is
not
a
question
of
legislative
power.
it's
a
question
of
sovereign
power
and
the
people
have
reserved
it
in
the
document
of
a
state
constitution.
now
as
to
the
matter
of
relief,
i
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
pardon.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
oh,
yes!
in
denying
a
legislature
of
that
power
what
they
did
was
they
enacted
the
legislation
to
set
up
a
constitutional
convention
because
this
is
the
only
way
we're
going
to
get
this
cured
on
a
permanent
basis
prior
to
the
1966
deadline.
then
the
legislature
said,
“that's
an
expensive
process.
why
don't
we
submit
to
you
what
we
would
like
as
an
interim
plan
and
if
you
approve
it,
put
it
in
as
the
court's
order.”
simply
stated,
the
court
didn't
like
the
plan
and
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
put
it
into
effect
for
the
--
for
the
next
election
which
would
be
this
1966
election.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
as
its
--
as
the
district
court's
order
and
i
think
that
was
understood
by
all
parties
to
the
suit.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
that's
right.
now,
we
have
this
situation
that
we
are
now
in
legislative
session
in
hawaii
from
being
last
wednesday
for
the
30-day
budget
session.
if
this
court
adheres
to
what
apparently
where
you
set
as
a
1966
general
election
deadline,
the
only
way
in
my
judgment
that
we
can
have
a
reapportioned
legislature
elected
in
1966
is
by
a
district
court
order
and
i
know
that
--
that
the
district
courts
and
this
court
hesitates
to
get
in
until
states
have
had
a
chance
to
work
this
out
for
themselves.
i'm
suggesting
that
you
might
give
consideration
to
a
general
election
of
1968
deadline
for
hawaii
because
we're
fairly
new
to
this
reapportionment
fight.
this
all
started
in
1964
after
reynolds
versus
sims
and
although,
the
legislature
has
made
a
couple
of
efforts
to
meet
this
problem.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
our
--
it's
a
little
complicated.
it
requires
the
legislature
to
enact
if
they're
all
setting
it
up
in
creating
one
providing
for
the
election
of
delegates
which
you
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
the
election
of
the
--
the
constitution
says
that
unless
the
legislature
otherwise
provides,
the
delegates
will
be
elected
in
the
same
manner
as
they
were
in
1950
which
is
not
completely
on
a
population
and
registered
voter
basis,
but
it
gives
the
island
of
oahu
adjourning
to
delegates.
and
then
there
would
be
two
elections
that
would
be
required,
and
then
the
submission
of
the
constitutional
convention
proposal
to
the
people
at
a
special
election.
this
could
all
be
accomplished
well
in
last,
last
year
when
the
district
court
was
faced
with
this
problem.
it
could
have
been
accomplished
prior
to
the
general
election
this
year.
i
doubt
if
we
could
start
from
scratch
today
and
get
it
done
by
the
general
election
of
1966'.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
yes.
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
oh,
no.
i
think
it
would
be
a
liberal
allowance,
your
honor.
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
that's
right.
if
--
if
--
unless
we
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
we
have
legislative
elections
this
year,
a
third
of
the
senate
and
all
of
the
house.
we
had
the
same
thing
in
1968.
with
this
expanded
time
table,
we
could
get
everything
done
by
1968.
i
don't
think
it
--
i
don't
think
as
a
practical
means
there's
enough
time
to
do
it
now.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
pardon?
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
yes,
we
do.
thirty
days
before
the
general.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
october.
our
general
was
the
same
as
the
first
two
or
three
of
november.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
yes,
that's
correct
and
i
don't
really
think
there's
time
to
do
it.
you
see
we've
got
a
--
we've
got
two
ways
to
amend
the
hawaii
constitution.
one
is
that
an
amendment
proposed
by
the
legislature.
our
constitution
says
this
may
only
be
voted
on
adding
general
election
so
that
route
is
out
if
we
do
1966
and
if
we
stick
to
that
deadline.
the
other
way
is
by
initiative
or
a
proposal
coming
out
of
the
constitutional
convention
which
can
be
done
at
a
special
occasion,
not
simply
the
general,
but
there
isn't
time
that
--
the
timetable
isn't
big
enough
in
1966
to
meet
that.
so
i'm
suggesting
is
have
some
--
what
was
the
case
decided
the
other
day,
i
think
it
was
fortson
case
again,
one
of
the
other
routes,
dorsey
versus
fortson
at
the
district
court
level,
as
i
read
that
case
and
it's
cited
in
mr.
marumoto's
supplemental
brief
on
the
plaintiffs,
they
had
got
a
way
from
this
1966
general
election
deadline.
the
people
of
hawaii
can
do
this.
there's
no
question
about
it
and
we'd
much
rather
do
it
than
have
a
court
obviously,
than
have
a
court
do
it.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
i
would
think
it
would
go
back
down
to
the
district
court.
the
stay
order
would
--
would
be
reinstated
in
a
legis
--
to
the
current
legislature,
presumably,
after
a
motion
is
filed
would
be
under
a
restraint
to
set
up
the
constitutional
convention
machinery
or
constitutional
amendment
machinery.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
--
right
away.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
well,
then
i
would
suppose
that
you'd
suggest
to
the
district
court
that
it
entered
that
as
a
part
of
each
order
for
1966
election.
mr.
robert
g.
dodge
newly
apportionment.
it
could
certainly
at
that
time,
certainly.
