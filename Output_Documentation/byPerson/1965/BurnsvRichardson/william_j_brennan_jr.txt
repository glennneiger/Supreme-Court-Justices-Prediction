--
two
small
islands
had
taken
the
house
in
maui,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
for
the
house
--
this
is
for
the
house.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
are
multi-member
for
the
senate
here
--
justice

yes.
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
notice
that
389,
civilian
employees
in
the
armed
forces,
would
that
be
right?
18,000,
this
is
january
1,
1964,
18,798?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
--
but
that's
the
only
data
of
which
we
have
that
figure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
this
other
one,
other
employed
civilians
217,000,
who
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
know
whether
that
figure
of
civilian
employees
of
the
armed
forces
has
a
fluctuation
which
matches
out
of
the
military
personnel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
does
it
take
to
convene
the
constitution
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
election,
according
to
the
legislature
of
reapportionment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
a
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
liberal
allowance
or
is
that
minimum?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
that
this
ought
to
be
a
permanent
one
on
the
act
where
a
constitution
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
calendar
with
two-thirds
but
it
maybe
passed
by
a
majority
since
it
is
passed
by
a
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
[inaudible]
if
that
happens
what
goes
to
the
general
election.
there's
a
question
whether
there
shall
be
a
constitutional
convention
or
if
it
then
adopted
as
a
constitutional
convention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
adoption
is
what,
the
constitutional
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
it
is
ratified
at
the
november
election,
that
will
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
and
there
at
this
general
election,
amend
your
constitution,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually
then
--
then
you
have
a
constitutional
amendment
and
then
you'll
have
a
constitutional
convention
which
may
adopt
still
a
different
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
get
a
complete
new
composition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
--
but
the
composition,
has
that
--
is
that
part
of
the
submission
in
november
or
is
that
has
to
be
decided
after
the
people
approve
the
constitutional
convention.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
just
assume
to
see
that
wide
open,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
what
page
did
you
say,
mr.
marumoto
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
