mr.
stanford
shmukler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
which
denied
a
petition
for
post-conviction
relief.
the
--
there
was
a
murder,
a
homicide
at
6:10
p.m.
on
a
friday
evening,
january
24th,
1958.
at
1:30
p.m.
the
following
tuesday,
a
defendant
by
the
name
of
godfrey
was
arrested
in
the
company
of
someone
else.
the
petitioner
cassidy
was
not
arrested
until
4
a.m.
in
the
morning,
wednesday
morning,
after
the
homicide
january
29th
and
petitioner
johnson
was
not
arrested
until
5
p.m.that
evening,
wednesday
evening,
the
29th
of
january.
after
the
arrests
of
these
three
individuals
during
those
two
days,
the
three
of
them
gave
a
total
of
six
statements,
incriminating
statements.
from
the
time
each
of
them
were
arrested,
they
were
in
the
complete
custody
of
the
police
and
they
were
in
custody
for
quite
sometime
as
will
developed
during
the
course
of
the
arguments.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
argument
here
falls
into
three
major
categories
of
arguments.
first
of
all,
we
are
suggesting
that
the
means
of
eliciting
these
confessions
and
using
them
at
the
time
of
their
trial,
during
the
time
when
they
were
not
advised
of
their
right
to
counsel,
they
were
not
advised
of
their
right
to
remain
silent
and
to
make
no
statements.
they
were
not
permitted
to
see
family.
they
were
not
proceeded
--
permitted
to
see
counsel
even
though
they
requested
it.
they
were
held
for
several
days
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
although,
i
will
put
note
that
to
say
that
one
of
the
petitioners
was
given
a
form
of
a
hearing,
he
was
arrested
not
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
where
they
were
ultimately
tried
in
camden.
but
he
was
arrested
in
newark
and
there
was
a
form
of
a
preliminary
hearing
during
which
apparently
the
only
thing
that
happened
was
a
transfer
of
custody
from
the
newark
police
to
the
camden
police.
nothing
in
the
record
shows
us
exactly
what
took
place
there,
although,
we
do
have
an
affidavit
of
that
petitioner
that
he
was
not
advised
of
any
rights
or
told
of
his
right
to
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir,
there
is.
there
is
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
we
feel
that
the
totally
of
the
circumstances
here
under
which
they
were
illegally
detained,
they
were
held
incommunicado.
they
were
not
told
of
their
right
to
remain
silent.
they
were
confronted
with
the
confessions
of
the
other
defendant
who
late
--
which
later
were
held
to
be
coerced
by
the
third
circuit
that
the
totally
of
all
these
circumstances
show
that
these
people
were
overborne.
and
we
also
wish
to
urge
that
the
interpretation
of
the
escobedo
case
which
we
feel
means
if
the
six
amendment
is
giving
effect
to
the
fifth
amendments
shows
that
the
absence
of
counsel
here
and
the
absence
of
an
advice
of
their
right
to
counsel
deprive
them
of
the
one
feature
which
is
essential
on
all
confession
cases,
the
right
to
make
a
free
choice.
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
make
a
free
choice
because
they
were
not
in
possession
of
the
facts
necessary
to
make
a
free
choice.
we
have
another
line
of
arguments
here
which
does
not
involve
the
escobedo
interpretation.
and
that
is
that
these
individuals
who
sought
separate
trials,
who
sought
to
have
their
cases
severed
and
who
sought
during
the
course
of
the
joint
trial
after
they
were
refused
separate
trials,
the
use
of
this
cross-implicating
confessions
against
each
other
deprived
them
of
a
fair
trial.
in
the
sense
of
the
aranda
decision
in
california
and
as
now
seems
to
be
the
practice
announced
in
a
new
york
and
a
new
jersey
case,
young
case
which
is
cite
in
our
brief.
and
lastly,
the
inflammatory
comments
and
summation
by
the
prosecutor
deprived
them
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
i
might
state
that
there
were
two
other
issues
which
were
raised
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
which
have
been
rendered
both
by
decisions
of
this
court.
one
issue
concerned
the
use
of
a
gun
which
we
claim
was
obtained
from
them
under
a
promise
which
was
not
kept
and
we
recognize
that
the
linkletter
case
renders
this
argument
moot.
likewise,
we
raise
the
question
that
the
prosecutor's
comment
on
their
failure
to
testify
supported
by
the
court's
charge
on
that
point
violated
the
malloy
and
griffin
cases.
however,
this
court
in
deciding
kean
has
certainly
mooted
that
point
insofar
as
we
talk
about
the
retroactivity
of
the
malloy
and
griffin
points.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
which
is
i
assumed
in
--
i
distribute
to
the
court
although
it
was
printed
rather
late,
we
were
unable,
the
court
printed
it
and
i
think
it
was
distributed.
we
do
not
give
up
the
argument
which
we'd
made
in
the
principal
brief
that
the
prosecutor's
comments
on
the
failure
testify,
also
affected
or
taken
in
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
his
entirely
inflammatory
summation
suggested
inferences
which
were
not
supported
by
any
facts
and
that
those
comments
taken
along
with
the
others
violated
in
--
violated
their
fourteenth
amendment
rights
not
the
fifth
amendment
right
as
we
--
as
had
originally
been
suggested
in
connection
with
the
griffin
and
malloy.
now,
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
the
means
of
eliciting
and
using
these
confessions,
these
--
first
of
all,
the
background
on
these
individuals
we
think
is
relevant
here
to
show
the
need
for
counsel
at
this
stage
which
certainly,
if
we
have
to
give
the
label
was
passed
the
accusatory
stage
because
when
the
first
of
these
petitioners
was
arrested,
cassidy,
he
had
already
been
apparently
identified
by
the
other
people
who
had
been
arrested.
certainly
as
to
johnson,
he
was
told
that
he
had
been
identified
as
the
finger
man.
they
did
not
come
in
and
picked
up
a
man
near
the
scene
or
who
might
have
some
information
about
the
crime.
they
were
here
to
arrest
these
individuals,
to
place
them
under
arrest
and
charge
them
with
the
crime
for
which
they
were
ultimately
tried
and
convicted
and
give
him
the
death
sentence.
cassidy
is
25
years
--
was
25
years
of
age
at
the
time.
he'd
only
completed
an
eight
grade
education.
he
had
never
had
any
contact
with
the
--
with
a
police
in
the
sense
of
being
arrested
or
convicted
of
any
crime
before
and
the
psychological
data
which
is
part
of
the
record
showed
that
he
was
a
highly
conflicted,
immature
individual
with
deep
feelings
of
incompetence,
inadequate
personality,
and
that
he
needed
narcotics
to
alleviate
his
anxieties
and
he
was
very
passive
and
repented
individual.
and
there
is
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir,
i've
--
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
that
although
there
is
no
admission
on
the
record
by
any
of
the
police
officer
who
made
that
arrest
it
was
--
it
should
have
been
obvious
to
them.
and
especially
in
light
of
the
petitioner's
testimony
at
(inaudible)
--
at
the
motion
for
new
trial
hearing
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
narcotics
at
the
time.
this
should
have
been
apparent
to
them.
now,
whether
they
knew
of
his
eight
grade
education,
whether
they
knew
his
age,
i
assume
they
elicited
that
from
him
when
they
spoke
to
him.
the
psychological
data
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
justice
fortas.
i
doubtedly
would've
known
that
and
i
doubted
any
of
us
would
know
that
without
the
report
of
a
psychiatrist
or
psychologist
which
of
course
was
obtained
here
after
they
had
been
incarcerated.
johnson
on
the
other
hand
was
only
21
years
of
age.
he
had
only
had
a
seventh
grade
education.
he
had
only
one
prior
conviction
and
the
psychological
data
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
he
was
--
had
intense
feelings
of
insecurity
and
inadequacy.
he
was
grossly
inadequate
with
a
schizoid
personality
and
his
ability
in
judgment
would
go
to
pieces
under
duress
and
strain.
now,
these
individuals
with
this
limited
ability
to
stand
up
to
the
official
detention
and
custody
were
arrested.
the
first
one,
cassidy
was
arrested
at
4
a.m.
in
the
morning
in
his
home
with
seven
police
officers.
he
was
taken
to
the
camden
police
station
where
he
was
confined
thereafter
and
according
to
the
affidavits,
he
sought
--
he
tried
to
consult
with
counsel.
he
wanted
to
consult
with
counsel.
he
wanted
to
consult
with
family
and
he
was
refused
permission.
there
was
no
warrant
for
his
arrest.
in
other
words,
a
middle
of
the
night
arrest,
large
number
of
officers
held
incommunicado,
his
first
confession
was
given
five
hours
later.
this
wasn't
sufficient
for
the
police.
they
came
back
and
they
got
another
confession
in
which
he
modified
his
former
confession.
that
was
two
hours
later
and
then
another
11
hours
--
11
and
a
half
hours
later,
a
third
confession.
the
other
petitioner,
johnson,
was
arrested
in
newark
and
was
held
there
at
five
o'clock
in
the
evening,
far
from
home,
taken
to
the
police
station
in
newark.
held
there
until
this
night
court
when
apparently
nothing
happened
that
was
significant
to
him
or
at
least
nothing
which
significantly
warned
him
of
any
of
his
rights
or
gave
him
any
advice
or
succor
under
these
trying
circumstances.
he
was
brought
back
to
camden
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
1:30
or
2
o'clock
in
the
morning.
they
put
him
the
car.
they
drove
him
to
camden
with
a
stop
for
a
cup
of
coffee.
during
the
time
he
claimed,
he
was
questioned
during
the
entire
ride.
in
fact,
he
claimed
that
he
was
beaten
during
the
course
of
this
ride.
and
it
wasn't
until
4
o'clock
in
the
morning,
4:45
in
the
morning
that
he
gave
his
incriminating
statements.
now
under
these
circumstances,
we
believe
that
it
is
fairly
clear
that
he
needed
the
help
and
advice
of
a
friendly
face
of
an
adviser,
of
someone
to
give
him
some
kind
of
advice,
and
the
honorable
solicitor
general
has
said
that
under
these
circumstances
the
only
advice
an
attorney
can
give
is
to
tell
the
defendant
to
keep
quiet.
i
would
like
to
differ
with
that.
i
think
there's
a
lot
more
that
an
attorney
can
do
under
these
circumstances.
at
that
point,
counsel
could
have
advised
him
of
the
legal
significance
of
admitting
to
a
robbery.
now
in
the
escobedo
case,
the
court
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
admitted
to
complicity
in
a
crime
not
realizing
the
legal
significance
of
that
complicity.
in
this
case,
it
became
extremely
important
because
this
case
was
tried
on
a
felony
murder
theory
that
there
was
a
robbery.
the
petitioners
have
argued
that
there
was
no
felony
murder.
there
was
no
robbery.
that
they
had
gone
to
the
store
to
obtain
money
from
the
store
--
toy
store
operator,
the
man,
the
victim,
the
deceased
which
he
owed
to
them.
he
owed
to
them
not
for
a
very
nice
purpose
because
apparently
they
had
delivered
some
narcotics
for
him
and
they
went
there
to
get
the
money
that
he
owes
them,
not
to
rob
him.
therefore,
when
these
individuals
are
held
under
these
threatening,
coercive
circumstances,
and
are
told
that
they
are
wanted
--
they
want
a
statement
from
these
individuals
as
to
what
part
they've
had
in
this
murder
--
this
robbery
murder
and
they
admit
to
being
participants
in
a
robbery
they
have
signed
their
own
doom
without
knowing
the
significance
of
it.
admitting
to
a
robbery
would've
seen
to
them
untrained
and
uncounseled
by
legal
counsel
at
that
point.
admitting
to
the
robbery
was
a
small
matter
compared
to
admitting
to
the
homicide
and
what
did
they
admit
to?
well,
johnson
admitted
that
he
had
been
the
one
with
the
gun
and
he
gave
somewhat
exculpatory
statements
as
to
why
he
shot
the
man.
but
mostly
incriminatory
admitting
that
there
had
been
a
participation
of
robbery.
cassidy
and
godfrey
for
that
matter,
in
effect
said
that
johnson
was
the
man
who
did
it
and
they
didn't
know
anything
about
robbery
and
they
didn't
go
there
armed
and
so
forth
and
so
on
and
then
changed
this
during
the
course
of
their
second
and
third
statements.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
justice
black,
there
was
a
--
apparently
what
happened
is
that
when
the
shooting
occurred,
a
neighbor
of
the
toy
store
operator
run
out,
saw
the
defendants
or
two
of
the
defendants
leaving
the
store,
get
into
a
car,
somebody
observed
them
drive
away
in
a
car.
and
then
because
they
made
a
minor
traffic
violation,
they
made
an
illegal
left
turn
somebody
took
down
the
license
number
of
the
car.
and
through
the
license
number
they
were
able
to
trace
them,
get
to
godfrey,
who
subsequently
--
when
he
was
arrested
was
in
company
of
a
fellow
by
name
of
noah
hamilton,
who
subsequently
told
all
he
knew
and
they
had
discussed
this
with
noah
hamilton.
and
there
was
also
a
fingerprint
of
one
of
the
defendants
found
on
one
of
the
items
in
the
store.
and
i
believe
there
was
a
adequate
other
evidence
in
the
record
to
have
sustained
a
conviction
of
participation
in
the
homicide
without
the
confessions,
however,
the
confessions
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
they
weren't
stopped
at
that
time,
somebody
just
jutted
down
their
license
number
at
that
time
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
--
that
was
a
minutes
afterwards.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
minutes
afterwards.
they
went
out
of
the
store
and
got
into
the
car
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that
occurred
on
friday
night,
the
24th
at
6:10
p.m.
and
the
first
one,
godfrey,
was
not
arrested
until
tuesday
at
1:30
in
the
afternoon,
one,
two,
three,
four
days
later,
approximately.
the
--
certainly
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
arrested
immediately.
the
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
they
were
legally
arrested.
there
was
no
question
about
that.
godfrey
was
the
first
one
arrested
while
he
was
in
a
café
in
company
of
noah
hamilton.cassidy
was
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that
is
our
point
mr.
justice
black,
definitely.
when
they
are
arrested
in
police
custody,
certainly
charged
with
the
crime
prior
to
any
advice
of
their
rights,
does
the
six
amendment
give
effect
to
the
fifth
amendment
protection
there,
the
fifth
amendment
protection
not
to
incriminate
themselves.
the
six
amendment
giving
them
the
right
to
counsel
to
advice
them
of
these
essential
rights
at
that
stage,
that
critical
stage
of
this
incident.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
justice
fortas,
there
was
no
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
cassidy,
one
of
our
petitioners
here.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
makes
clear
whether
or
not
there
was
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
johnson
in
newark.
there
was
some
testimony
by
one
of
the
police
officers,
i
don't
have
the
citation
page,
they
just
made
the
statement
that
we
had
some
sort
of
warrants.
this
warrant
was
never
put
on
the
record.
it
was
never
questioned.
and
as
i
say
at
that
point
in
5
o'clock
in
the
evening
when
he
was
arrested,
it
was
at
10
o'clock
in
the
evening
taken
to
a
night
court,
and
the
transfer
of
custody
took
place
to
the
camden
police.
apparently,
the
camden
police
must
have
gone
to
newark
police
and
received
some
form
of
--
or
given
some
form
of
compliant
that
they
wanted
him.
the
newark
police
accompanied
the
camden
police,
arrested
him,
took
him
to
newark
police
station
and
then
transferred
custody
that
evening.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir,
we
mean
they
were
seized,
restrained
of
liberty,
placed
in
the
custody
of
the
police,
and
were
subsequently
booked.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
they
were
not
booked
immediately
at
that
time.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
as
well
--
at
least
in
johnson's
case.
in
cassidy's
case,
i
don't
think
it's
clear
when
he
was
booked.
but
he
was
certainly
restrained
of
liberty,
could
not
have
left,
there
was
no
question
about
that,
was
taken
out
of
his
home.
in
cassidy's
case,
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
taken
to
the
police
station,
and
remained
thereafter
in
custody
of
the
police.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
there
is
no
question
in
--
at
this
point
of
the
validity
of
the
arrest
justice
black
even
though
there
was
no
warrant.
i
will
concede
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
certainly
we
have
not
raised
the
question
at
any
time
that
they
do
not
have
prima
facie
case
to
--
prima
facie
evidence
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
at
that
point
or
with
a
warrant.
i'm
not
going
to
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
--
we're
not
resting
our
case
on
that
point,
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
certainly
posing
the
issue.
that
is
one
of
the
crucial
issues.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
certainly
the
--
phrasing
the
issue
in
the
fifth
amendment
context
here.
the
right
to
not
to
be
compelled
at
that
stage
of
the
game
and
the
factor
of
being
in
police
custody
incommunicado
without
advice
of
rights
and
without
the
counsel
of
a
guiding
hand
at
that
point
whether
he
has
affectively
been
deprived
of
his
right
not
to
incriminate
himself.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
if
they
had
been
legally
advised,
i
would
still
say
that
there
were
circumstances
--
that
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
arrest
and
detention
of
these
individuals
were
so
inherently
coercive
and
overbearing
that
without
counsel
to
advice
them
actually,
under
these
circumstances
any
statement
elicited
thereafter
would
be
improperly
admitted
in
their
trial
for
the
very
reason
that,
they
did
not
understand
the
legal
significance
of
the
questions
that
were
being
asked
them.
they
did
not
understand,
for
example,
that
the
confessions
of
the
others
would
not
be
usable
against
them
in
a
trial
but
would
be
usable
only
against
the
person
giving
them.
for
example,
they
were
told,
godfrey
has
already
confessed.
you
may
has
--
have
--
you
may
as
well
confess.
they
were
not
told
and
could
not
be
told
without
counsel
there
to
advice
them
that
this
isn't
true.
they
don't
have
to
confess
just
because
godfrey
has
named
them.
godfrey's
statement
would
not
be
admissible
against
them.
and
in
fact,
in
this
case,
godfrey's
statement
in
a
joint
trial
was
used
in
the
trial
but
not
against
them.
they
were
limiting
instructions
and
we
contend
that
even
with
those
limiting
instructions,
the
joint
trial
was
improper.
but
had
they
had
separate
trials
or
had
the
jury
been
able
to
strike
from
their
minds,
their
collective
minds,
the
confessions
of
godfrey
this
would
not
have
been
admissible
against
them
and
only
the
advice
of
counsel
especially
with
uneducated,
poorly
psychic
background
boys
could
this
type
of
significance
have
been
made
clear
to
them.
this
is
why
in
our
case
here
we
do
not
have
to
read
escobedo
very
broadly
to
in
--
to
encompass
all
of
the
other
cases
that
are
involved
here.
this
is
a
very
limiting
factual
circumstance.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
escobedo
should
not
be
read
broadly
or
that
it
should
be
read
very
narrowly.
i
am
suggesting
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
no
need
for
a
broad
rule.
this
can
fit
within
the
very
narrow
circumstances
of
the
escobedo
case
itself.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
the
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
oh,
just
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
justice
fortas,
i
think
perhaps
you
mean
cassidy.
cassidy
was
arrested
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
and
he
was
held
for
five
hours
before
he
gave
his
first
statement.
johnson
was
arrested
in
newark
and
was
held
--
oh,
i
meant
--
no,
i'm
sorry
maybe
you
are
--
you
--
maybe
i'm
wrong.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
he
was
held
for
five
hours
before
being
taken
to
this
police
court.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes.
he
was
interrogated
during
that
time,
retracted
and
continuous
interrogation
during
that
period
of
time.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir,
the
--
we
are
not
quiet
sure.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
the
nature
of
this
police
court
proceeding
in
newark.
apparently,
it
was
simply
just
a
transfer
of
jurisdiction.
there
is
a
rule
in
new
jersey
which
says
that
a
person
who
was
arrested
is
to
be
taken
before
the
--
a
magistrate
in
the
--
within
--
without
any
unreasonable
delay.
this
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
this
was
violated
certainly
in
the
case
of
cassidy
and
probably
in
the
case
of
johnson
because
this
rule
goes
on
to
say
not
only
should
he
be
brought
before
a
court
or
magistrate,
nearest
available
magistrate
and
the
compliant
shall
be
filed
forthwith
and
a
warrant
issue
thereon
a
preliminary
hearing
before
the
magistrate
shall
be
held
forthwith.
and
then
the
rule
goes
on,
this
is
new
jersey
revised
rules
3-3:2-3
(a).
the
next
subsection
of
that
rule
goes
on
to
say
that
the
magistrate
shall
advice
him
of
his
rights
and
of
his
rights
to
have
counsel
and
so
forth.
this
was
not
the
proceeding
which
took
place
in
newark.
apparently
the
only
thing
that
took
place
in
newark,
it
is
not
accord
of
record.
we
have
been
unable
to
obtain
the
record
in
that
case
but
apparently
the
only
proceeding
that
took
place
in
newark
was
the
transfer
of
jurisdiction
from
the
newark
police
to
the
camden
police.
he
was
then
returned
to
the
newark
jail,
was
held
there
till
1:30
at
night,
was
apparently
questioned
during
that
period
of
time,
he
was
then
placed
in
a
car,
taken
back
to
camden,
on
the
road
he
was
continuously
questioned,
and
finally,
started
his
confession
at
4:45
in
the
morning.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
don't
know
that
we
have
discussed
this
but
i
don't
think
that
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
discloses
this
at
all.
i
don't
think
that
--
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
a
testimony
of
any
of
the
officers
what
was
done
there.
there
is
an
affidavit
contained
in
the
petition
or
it
was
considered
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
i
should
say
in
this
case,
setting
forth
what
the
defendant
johnson
said
happened
there.
he
said,
he
doesn't
really
know
what
did
happen.
his
statement
was
that
he
didn't
know
what
was
going
on.
he
was
taken
there,
somebody
handed
up
some
papers
and
he
was
taken
out
again.
and
that's
set
forth
in
the
--
in
his
petition.
the
--
is
certainly
clear
that
the
petitioners
here
did
not
have
the
right
to
make
a
free
choice
as
to
whether
to
admit,
to
deny
or
to
do
anything
else
because
they
did
not
have
the
facts
available
to
them
at
the
time
that
these
statements
were
taken.
now,
it's
clear
that
in
the
record,
the
only
warning
that
was
ever
given
to
them
was
the
warning
which
was
given
to
them
when
the
formal
recording
of
the
confession
took
place.
and
this
was
the
warning
by
the
--
by
chief
dube,
chief
of
the
county
detectives,
as
they
took
him
into
the
room
to
record
their
confessions
that
you
--
any
statement
you
make
must
be
freely
given
and
voluntary
and
truthful
and
nothing
else.
they
are
not
advised
of
their
right
to
counsel
or
their
right
to
remain
silent.
in
fact,
it's
doubtful
whether
new
jersey
even
requires
that.
now,
it
is
our
contention
here
that
the
escobedo
case
did
not
introduce
a
radical
new
departure
from
the
law.
that
the
escobedo
case
was
merely
the
next
logical
step
and
if
there
are
no
more
problems
of
administration
created
by
applying
escobedo
in
our
case
on
a
collateral
attack
then
would
be
the
--
applying
the
doctrine
that
a
confession
which
is
obtained
by
psychological
pressures,
might
have
created
after
the
court's
holdings
previously
might
have
suggested
that
only
physical
beatings
were
sufficient
or
extending
it
to
the
mild
weeps
of
refusing
to
give
him
access
to
his
wife
as
in
the
haines
case.
but
this
was
not
a
radical
new
departure.
thus,
in
the
terms
of
(inaudible)
in
the
linkletter
cases,
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
determining
process
is
just
as
much
involved
here
where
these
defendants
confessed
to
items
which
they
did
not
realized
the
legal
significance
of
and
which
could
very
well
have
been
false
because
it
just
--
they
had
no
knowledge
of
the
legal
significance
of
this
anymore
than
escobedo
did
in
his
case.
now,
in
the
--
in
connection
with
the
--
by
the
way
i
might
to
say
that,
i
think
that
the
question
of
obtaining
the
confession
of
one
defendant
and
then
using
it
as
a
technique
to
obtain
the
confessions
of
the
other
defendants
is
--
just
highlights
this
need
for
a
legal
counseling
at
that
stage.
as
the
illegal
detention,
the
violation
of
the
new
jersey
rule
discontinued,
protracted,
questioning
during
a
period
of
time
when
the
very
police
officers
were
violating
their
new
jersey
rules
by
not
taking
him
before
the
nearest
available
magistrate
for
the
hearing.
by
the
way,
they
did
not
actually
get
taken
to
the
magistrate
until
the
31st,
which
would
be
friday,
would
be
two
days
after
cassidy
was
arrested
and
the
day
and
a
half
after
johnson
had
been
arrested.
now
likewise,
we
want
to
go
--
we'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
use
of
those
confessions
in
a
joint
trial
over
the
objection
of
the
defendants
that
they
were
so
cross
incriminatory
and
request
from
the
defense
counsel
to
strike
this
cross
incriminating
portions
and
this
was
denied.
in
other
words,
they
asked,
if
you're
going
to
allow
godfrey's
test
--
confession
to
be
used
in
evidence,
cross
out,
delete
the
portions
relating
to
cassidy
and
johnson
and
so
on.
this
was
denied
and
we
contend
that
this
technique
of
trying
three
defense
together
and
introducing
six
confessions
all
of
which
were
cross-incriminatory
violated
their
rights
to
a
fair
trial.
we
have
done
account
and
apparently
wayne
godfrey's
statements
mentions
stanley
cassidy,
his
first
statement
mention
him
67
times
and
the
second
statement
19
times
or
a
total
of
86
times.
and
he
mentions
sylvester
johnson
48
times
in
his
first
statement
and
nine
in
the
second
statement
or
57
times.
new
jersey
now
apparently
is
following
a
rule
where
it
will
permit
this
type
of
evidence
to
be
deleted
or
grant
new
trial
--
grant
separate
trials.
this
is
what
was
requested
here
and
it
was
not
given.
we
contend
that
this
violate
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir.
decision
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir,
it
is,
state
versus
young,
which
is
cited
in
a
footnote
25
of
our
brief.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
stanford
shmukler
well,
sir
of
course,
i
submit
that
we
don't
have
to
draw
the
broad
rules
here.
however,
i
would
suggest
the
practical
result
might
not
be
a
serious
as
has
been
suggested
here.
in
our
reply
brief,
i've
given
the
--
cited
an
article,
the
philadelphia
evening
bulletin
including
the
district
attorney,
assistant
district
attorney
spraig
who
helped
compiled
the
data
which
was
submitted
as
part
of
the
national
district
attorneys
association's
brief
in
which
a
few
weeks
after
escobedo
was
decided
he
suggested
that
their
statistics
seemed
to
indicate
that
this
has
not
limited
the
use
of
--
the
obtaining
of
confessions.
now,
perhaps
a
ruling
that
you
are
entitle
to
counsel
might
be
a
different
--
might
have
a
different
statistical
affect,
i
don't
think
we
know.
however,
i
feel
that
certainly,
in
the
light
of
this
case
that
decision
need
not
be
made.
the
practical
effect
would
seem
to
be
in
our
case
that
if
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
not
to
incriminate
yourself
whatever
means
we
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
well,
justice
black,
i
don't
think
that
is
necessarily
the
remedy
which
flows
on
this.
perhaps,
the
ruling
should
be
only
an
exclusionary
one
that
evidence
obtained
in
the
absence
of
counsel
would
not
be
admissible.
however,
i
'd--
i
don't
think
that
would
depend
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that
is
sir
and
i
don't
say
that
the
state
has
an
absolute
duty
to
appoint
at
this
stage
but
what
we
do
say
that
if
they
don't
appoint,
if
he
has
no
counsel
then
the
confessions
obtained
under
these
circumstances
are
not
admissible
at
his
trial.
if
nothing
flows
from
his
arrest
and
detention
then
perhaps
he
has
not
been
damage
by
the
lack
of
counsel.
but
where
the
circumstances
which
flow
from
it
are
the
obtaining
of
confessions
which
incriminate
them
so
severely
and
take
away
their
lives
ultimately,
then
those
confessions
should
not
be
used.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
well,
justice
black,
i'm
saying
that
under
these
circumstances
there
is
no
doubt
of
this.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
would
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
be
given
a
full
effect
must
be
based
upon
a
knowledge
of
the
factors
which
exist
and
only
counsel
can
supply
that
knowledge
of
the
factors
which
exist.
so
that
(inaudible)
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
right
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
right
sir
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
would
say
that
the
mere
holding
him
in
official
detention
abd
custody
would
itself
the
prima
facie
coercive
and
that
if
any
rule
should
be
announced.
it
should
be
that
the
government
has
the
burden
of
overcoming
that
to
show
that
anything
which
occurred
thereafter
was
done
in
an
absolute
waiver
situation.
the
waiver
of
their
right
to
counsel
a
--
an
announcement
that
the
defendant
knows
the
full
facts
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
no,
sir.
i
think
that
the
--
it
is
a
combination
of
factors
here
but
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
right
as
soon
he
is
detain
and
under
official
arrest
in
an
official
situation
away
from
home
is
enough
to
constitute
an
appearance
of
compulsion
sufficient
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
government
to
prove
that
anything
that
occurs
thereafter
was
completely
voluntary
and
of
free
choice.
and
that
the
government
must
then
show
that
the
defendant
had
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
upon
which
to
base
his
choice.
and
that
then
becomes
the
government's
burden
that
this
is
new
means
of
substituting
a
short
--
with
a
shorthand
phrase
of
involuntary
that
has
been
used
as
a
shorthand
previously.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
right.
that
that
is
--
that
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
--
as
was
pointed
out,
the
blackburn
case,
the
use
of
the
phrase
involuntary
under
those
circumstances
is
a
shorthand
for
all
the
complex
of
values
which
go
into
the
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
incriminate
himself.
if
with
the
court's
permission,
we
want
--
we
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
certainly,
i
think
that
would
be
a
permissible
reading
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
would
not
consider
that
to
be
revolutionary.
i
would
consider
that
to
be
an
evolutionary
--
in
(inaudible)
--
evolution
of
the
doctrine
which
is
already
been
announced.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
it
certainly
would,
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
of
course,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
think
that
perhaps
the
fear
of
the
ending
of
the
interrogation
process
there
can
be
overcome
by
the
right
of
the
government
under
appropriate
circumstances
to
cease
the
laboring
order,
the
laboring
order
that
it
has
the
better
opportunity
to
wield
to
show
that
it
was
not
involuntary
in
that
sense.
it
was
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
pardon
sir?
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
well,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
quite
as
boldly
as
that.
i
--
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
is
a
form
of
waiver
that
the
government
should
have
the
opportunity
under
those
circumstances
to
prove
a
free
waiver
of
the
right
--
the
fifth
amendment
right
not
incriminate
your
self.
and
that
in
so
showing
they
must
show
that
he
was
in
possession
of
all
of
the
relevant
facts
which
i
think
is
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
right
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
one
that
he
could
make
at
a
trial
for
that
matter.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
not
speak
further
on
the
last
point
but
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
colleague
mr.
haeberle
to
give
him
a
minute
or
two
of
rebuttal.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
thank
you,
sir.
