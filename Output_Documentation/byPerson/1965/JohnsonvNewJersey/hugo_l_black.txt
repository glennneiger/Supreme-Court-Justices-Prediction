justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
another
type
of
evidence
there
was
besides
the
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
after
they
were
--
after
the
robbery
was
committed
in
this
murder,
was
it
before
they
were
caught
and
whether
it
was
--
made
the
wrong
turn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
was
that
afterwards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
got
the
number?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
how
long
after
that
until
they
were
arrested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
arrested
at
first,
or
were
they
taken
down
for
questioning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
went
there
they
were
arrested.
they
had
--
they
were
legally
arrested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
question
here
--
your
question
is
rather,
were
they
legally
arrested,
charged
with
a
crime,
then
jailed,
does
the
fifth
amendment
protect
him
against
self-incrimination,
that's
one
of
them,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand,
i
had
a
--
that
there's
no
question
at
issue
here
concerning
the
validity
of
the
arrest
or
is
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
spread
it
out
it
seems
to
me
at
least
in
one
aspect
of
your
case
is
whether
when
a
man
has
--
illegally
arrested
and
put
in
jail
for
the
purpose
of
detention
aiming
until
he
can
be
tried
of
the
crime.
whether
or
not
the
police
have
thought
it
that
during
that
time
under
the
constitution,
the
fifth
amendment,
one
of
them
to
interrogate
him
alone
or
where
he
is
and
ask
him
of
the
question
to
--
tending
to
prove
your
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
that
is
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
--
suppose
he's
been
advice
of
his
rights?
supposed
he'd
been
told,
you
have
a
right
not
to
answer,
during
the
time
he's
legally
arrested
and
there
in
the
custody
waiting
trial
to
determine
his
guilt,
would
your
position
be
any
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
position
was
accepted
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
position
should
be
accepted
as
the
right
to
counsel,
what
would
be
the
practical
result?
what
would
states
have
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
(inaudible)
--
i
didn't
ask
you
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
were
emphasizing
the
counsel.
i
want
to
know
what
would
be
the
factual
effect,
and
how
would
it
effect
current
--
in
fact,
the
universal
practice
of
the
--
in
the
united
states.
the
whole
that
counsel
must
be
appointed
the
minute
a
man
was
detained
then
held
for
questioning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
your
argument,
however
based
finally
on
the
fact
that
he
needs
counsel
to
keep
him
incriminating
himself.
and
if
that's
true,
why
isn't
that
your
basic
issue
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
in
effect
asking
us
to
say
that
we
got
to
examine
the
circumstances
of
case
and
see
whether
under
those
circumstances,
you
needed
a
lawyer
so
badly
that
it
violated
the
right
to
counsel
clause,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
do
you
have
any
theory
about
what
circumstances
we
could
let
the
courts
know
so
that
there
would
be
some
kind
of
understanding
on
their
part
and
make
it
function
with
a
knowledge
that
the
general
rule
to
this
effect
that
if
he
break
that
rule,
if
it's
a
--
case
will
reversed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
you
thought
about
it
from
that
page
without
considering
all
the
circumstances
each
does,
all
the
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
just
--
going
on
the
basis
that
you
got
to
tie
the
two
together,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
think
the
factors
are
somewhat
the
same.
but
after
all,
when
you
get
back,
your
construing
are
you
not
fifth
amendment
provision
against
self-incrimination
being
compelled
of
your
witness
against
yourself,
isn't
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
the
question
of
what
is
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
think
it's
a
--
if
a
man
is
arrested,
held
by
the
purpose
of
an
arrest
as
to
hold
him
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
trial
unless
some
new
provision
has
been
drafted
under
the
constitution.
purpose
as
to
hold
him
for
trial
that
you
could
find
nothing
of
compulsion
in
he's
being
interrogated
by
the
officer
under
that
condition,
why
he
is
under
arrest,
and
there
alone
with
the
officer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
circumstance
you
mean
or
you
have
to
have
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
judged
--
i
judged
from
what
you're
saying,
its
impossible
in
your
judgment
for
us
to
decide
this
question
without
relying
on
the
other
provision
with
reference
to
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
compulsion
for
being
compelled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
be
wiser
sometimes
to
consider
those
thing
in
the
language
of
the
constitution
rather
than
labels
that
were
given
in
various
opinions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
a
startling
and
revolutionary,
i
don't
say
that
that's
a
possibility.
but
if
the
court
would
say,
“when
a
man
is
held
simply
to
interrogate
him
against
his
will
by
officers
at
a
place
where
he
does
not
want
to
be
that
that
is
compulsion
which
will
invalidate
the
admission
of
a
amend
--
of
a
confession?"
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
consider
that
to
be
revolutionary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
at
least
have
the
advantage
of
some
kind
of
a
certainty,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
we
didn't
have
to
pass
on
every
cases
(inaudible)
in
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
say
that
it
should
be
adopted.
i
don't
know
what
should
be
adopted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
talking
about
now
is
the
knowing
an
intelligent
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
that
they
have
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
have
declined
to
go?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
have
to
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
we
to
assume
that
they
went
because
they
wanted
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
be
a
very
important
--
of
that
charge
because
i'm
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
tell
him
that
he
didn't
have
to
answer
or
that
he
could
go
home
if
he
wanted
to?
did
they
tell
him
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course,
there's
been
a
difference
in
telling
to
a
man
who
is
under
arrest
or
in
jail
or
in
custody
of
officers
that
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
us
except
according
to
your
own
freewill
than
telling
a
man
on
the
street,
we'd
like
to
have
come
down
to
that
place
and
talk
to
us
a
little
if
you
want
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
to
clarify
my
own
view
to
what
--
is
it
your
position
that
you
have
a
right
if
you
want
to
take
a
man
for
(inaudible)
compel
him
if
he
answers,
compel
him
to
go
to
the
station,
talk
to
him
and
be
interrogated
about
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
well
that
--
that's
really
what
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
may
be
true.
i'm
not
saying
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
take
seven
officers
to
invite
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
much
argument
in
that
but
it
doesn't
--
still
doesn't
satisfy
the
question
as
to
whether
they
went
of
their
own
freewill
in
to
the
court
and
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
it
then,
an
addition
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
claim
now
with
(inaudible)
that
if
they
have
--
did
they
admit
precisely
the
same
thing
at
the
trial
to
which
they
had
confessed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
defendants
can
take
stand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
counsel
admitted
that
the
confessions
were
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
he
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
charge
if
the
counsel
the
first
time
was
inadequate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
you
say
that
it's
been
admitted
that
the
statement
was
true,
that
was
true
at
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
has
been
denied
in
sense.
do
you
think
that
would
have
any
relevance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that?
i'm
a
little
lost
with
this,
on
when
this
was
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
offer
that
you
are
speaking
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
at
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not
--
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this.
what
turns
me
on
this
particular
point
is
this
--
the
case
is
tried,
you
have
a
lawyer,
and
you
do,
it's
supposed
to
be
alright.
then,
your
attack
on
this
is
quite
unknown
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
were
--
he
was
a
lawyer.
when
the
confessions
were
offered
against
them,
they
did
not
object.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
admitted
that
they
were
the
truth
and
honorably
taken,
if
that's
the
word
to
be
use.
why
does
that
not
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
objection
that
they
were
involuntary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
--
the
state
could
not
put
him
on
the
stand
to
testify
against
his
will.
but
his
lawyer
was
at
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
--
can
we
go
behind
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
did,
what
could
be
shown,
i
don't
--
i
don't
even
see
that
it's
in
the
statement,
that
it
could
be
shown
that
the
lawyer
did
not
have
authority
to
do
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
even
if
that
were
admissible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
since
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
defendant
himself,
the
defendant
himself
had
testified
exactly
the
statement
made
by
the
attorney
during
the
trial,
and
he
said,
“we
do
not
deny
the
truth
as
we
do
this
thing”.
would
that
not
be
a
satisfaction
of
the
general
idea
that
the
waiver
must
be
made
knowingly
and
voluntarily
of
the
constitutional
privilege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
they
were
there.
