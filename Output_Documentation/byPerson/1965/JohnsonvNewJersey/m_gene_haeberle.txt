mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
mr.
haeberle
is
my
name.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
i'd
say
at
the
outset
that
we
wished
to
agree
with
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
as
to
his
frame
of
reference
for
escobedo
in
self-incriminating
statements
and
particularly
as
to
the
necessity
for
an
adequate
warning.
of
course
in
our
case,
the
warning
which
is
pointed
out
in
page
12
of
the
brief
which
was
given
repeatedly
was
no
warning
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
it
was
simply
that
first,
the
chief
of
police
said,
“i'm
going
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
a
holdup
and
it's
my
duty
to
warn
you
everything
you
tell
me
must
be
of
your
own
freewill,
must
be
the
truth,
without
any
promise
or
threats
being
made
to
you,
and
knowing
anything
you
can
tell
me,
we
maybe
use
it
against
you
or
any
other
person”.
this
doesn't
at
all
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
warning
as
expressed
to
this
court
by
the
solicitor
general
with
whom
we
agree.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
he
didn't
say
it
was
a
constitutional
requirement
but
he
said
that
he
felt
that
it
had
to
be
given
in
all
cases.
it
was
my
understanding
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
i
thought
i
understood
him
to
say
that
the
warning
should
be
given
and
that
failure
to
give
such
a
warning
and
failure
--
and
if
there's
--
there
was
interrogation
after
giving
such
a
warning,
that
any
statement
should
be
held
to
be
admissible.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
i'm
glad,
chief
justice.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
as
i
understand,
mr.
justice
harlan,
he
was
--
in
answer
to
your
questions,
and
particularly
to
mr.
justice
white
in
this
particular
case,
he
felt
that
an
adequate
warning
had
been
given
that
this
was
a
reasonably
average
person
that
he
could
understand
it.
in
the
facts
of
his
case,
he
did
not
want
a
reversal.of
course
in
our
particular
case,
the
defendants
involved
were
less
than
average.
i
think
too
that
--
it
ought
to
be
pointed
out
that
in
the
heat
of
oral
argument,
the
prosecutor
of
camden
county,
mr.
heine,
has
made
some
erroneous
statements
which
should
be
corrected.
for
instance,
as
reference
to
whether
these
defendants
were
police
guests,
it's
rather
surprising
because
in
answer
to
mr.
heine's
own
question
whether
these
defendants
were
arrested,
this
is
the
question
now,
did
you
--
this
is
to
a
detective
on
page
92a
of
the
transcript,
“were
you
present
at
the
time
that
stanley
cassidy
was
arrested?”
answer,
“yes,
i
was”.
question,
“will
you
tell
us
when
and
where
that
took
place?”
answer,
“it
was
the
28th
of
january,
1958
at
312
pine
street
approximately
4
o'clock
in
the
morning”.
also
as
to
sylvester
johnson,
he
also
was
not
a
guest
at
the
--
police
social.
93a,
mr.
heine
again
asked,
“did
you
have
occasioned
to
arrest
sylvester
johnson?”
answer,
“yes,
i
did”.
from
both
places
in
the
record,
there's
no
--
no
question
about
it,
that
the
interrogation
--
the
accusatory
process
have
been
reached,
that
they
had
statements
incriminating
both
of
these
defendants
that
they
were
subjected
to
a
long
period
of
interrogation.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
counsel
at
trial
in
the
heat
of
that
summation
was
similar
to
the
--
then
the
heat
of
that
summation,
the
heat
of
that
trial,
the
culmination
was
in
the
same
--
as
i
say,
a
similar
position
to
mr.
heine
here
before
this
court
in
argument.
it
was
the
last
desperation
move
in
effort
to
gain
some
--
some
form
of
mercy
from
the
court
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
--
from
a
jury.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well,
at
this
particular
point
i
don't
think
that
the
true
or
falsity
of
the
confession
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
--
is
irrelevant.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well,
i
think
it
was
a
trial
tactic,
perhaps
one
that
the
present
counsel
wouldn't
have
taken,
but
at
the
heat
of
the
moment
these
confessions
had
gone
in,
they
had
made
motions
--
specific
motions
to
delete,
incriminating
reference
in
these
joined
statements,
they
had
asked
for
joined
trials,
all
of
these
things
have
been
denied.
mr.
heine
had
made
an
opening
of
his
summation
in
which
he
delineated
in
detail
to
the
jury
how
the
prosecutor's
office
had
used
these
defendants
against
one
another.
and
the
summation
on
page
253a
of
the
record,
he
talks
about
--
at
first,
they
got
a
statement
from
noah
hamilton,
then
they
got
a
statement
from
godfrey,
then
cassidy
is
arrested,
then
he
goes
on
to
page
254
and
tell
us
how
they
used
godfrey
against
cassidy,
cassidy
against
godfrey,
and
all
of
them
against
one
another.
and
at
the
point
that
it
arose,
i
think
it
was
a
situation
that
the
heat
of
argument,
that
they
--
they
perhaps
went
further
than
they
should.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
and
i
will
say
the
court
that
it
is
not
admission
that
there
was
voluntary,
they
didn't
contest
the
voluntariness.
but
it
is
clear
ever
since
that
time
they
have
stated
that
they
did
contest
the
voluntariness
particularly
that
it
was
not
a
robbery
that
was
committed.
this
was
one
of
the
important
things
when
they
took
these
two
bumpkins
of
people
of
limited
intelligent
and
poor
background
and
got
confession
from
them,
they
didn't
know
the
difference
of
the
felony
murder
rule.
when
those
confessions
were
taken,
they
were
in
the
death
house.
and
when
those
confessions
were
used
at
a
joint
trial
which
they
incriminate
each
other
so
completely,
so
overwhelmingly,
there
was
nothing
--
there
was
very
little
left
to
be
done.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
the
reporter?
the
reporter.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well,
there
was
no
question
about
--
what
the
prosecutor
did
was
he
introduced
the
record
of
the
statements
themselves
and
the
reporter
who
took
them
during
the
time.
this
inadequate
so-called
warning
was
given
at
the
time
they
were
transcribed.
none
of
--
no
questions
were
asked
prior
to
the
transcription.
in
other
words,
as
to
the
reason
that
justice
hastie
for
the
third
circuit
as
to
godfrey
held
them
professed,
justice
hastie
said
that
the
questioning
by
chief
dube
was
the
culmination
of
pressures
not
the
release
from
pressures.
and
the
records
on
these
interrogations
are
only
the
actual
statement
itself.
there's
nothing
in
the
--
in
that
record
up
to
that
point
of
time
which
goes
into
the
background
of
how
these
defendants
were
arrested,
how
they
were
interrogated,
how
they
were
kept,
how
they
were
kept
incommunicado.
the
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
yes.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
during
the
trial.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well,
it
is
true
that
the
defendants
offered
nothing
to
rebut
the
voluntariness
of
the
confessions.
however,
the
state
introduced
only
the
facts
around
the
taking
of
the
confessions
themselves.
and
from
the
moment
of
this
trial,
from
the
moment
afterwards,
the
defendants
have
consistently
contended
--
and
we
have
for
six
years,
we've
been
trying
to
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
these
facts
since
we
got
in
this
case
in
1961,
professor
reitz,
mr.
shmukler
and
myself,
we've
been
trying
to
get
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
prosecutor
objects
to
affidavits
or
psychiatric
material
going
in
evidence.
actually,
the
psychiatric
materials
from
the
state
experts
at
menlo
park,
new
jersey
state
experts
and
new
jersey
state
institution
and
they
were
printed,
they
were
part
of
the
trial
court
record
before
the
lower
court,
they're
mentioned
in
the
opinion
at
177
atlantic
2nd,
they're
mentioned
in
new
jersey

appendix

by

prosecutor
for

on
the
hearing
for
post
conviction
relief,
the
prosecutor
objects
ironically
that
we
didn't
introduce
evidence.
well
we
have
the
witnesses
in
the
court
and
it
shows
in
the
transcript
that
they
were
present
in
court.
we
want
to
take
their
testimony
but
the
court
wouldn't
hear
the
testimony.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
the
court
wouldn't
hear
the
testimony
and
i
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
that
appears
in
the
record
your
honor
at
page
25a,
line
19.
“i
know,
your
honor”,
i
started
off
and
made
there,
“and
i
know,
your
honor,
it's
provided
only
for
oral
argument
here”,
that's
what
the
order
provided
for,
only
for
oral
argument
in
the
state
court
below.
however,
with
the
point
or
in
the
other
relief
requested,
i
would
call
some
of
the
friends
and
relatives
of
stanley
cassidy
and
sylvester
johnson.
i
then
pointed
out
the
names
of
the
people
and
they
stood
up
in
courtroom
whose
affidavits
are
annexed
here.
for
all
of
these
--
to
all
of
these
many
years,
five
or
almost
six
years
that
we've
been
in
this
case,
we've
been
asking
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
when
we
submit
affidavits
of
what
we
attempt
to
prove,
then
we're
told
that
we're
putting
a
hearsay
before
the
court.
now,
of
course
the
matter
is
that
we
introduce
this
psychiatric
and
psychological
material
to
state
experts,
they
were
never
contradicted.
the
prosecutor
didn't
call
these
witnesses
and
he
wouldn't
let
us
call
them.
and
he
didn't
cross-examine
them.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
and
i
think
now,
the
state's
hung
by
its
own
petard.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
as
to
the
psychiatric
and
psychological
material?
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
the
offer
here
is
on
this
petition,
proposed
conviction
relief
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
no,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well,
we
started
asking
for
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
--
we
started
asking
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
--
in
1961.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
how
long
after
--
it
was
--
the
last
hearing
was
in
1964.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
right.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
before
that,
there
were
other
hearings
in
1962.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
the
trial
was
in
‘59,
january
29th
1959.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well,
they
were
retained
by
donations
obtained
from
other
poor
people
in
their
own
neighborhood
and
they
received
a
nominal
sum.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
the
defendants
never
admitted
that
these
confessions
were
voluntary
nor
that
they
were
true.
in
summation
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
yes,
but
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well,
i
don't
--
i
would
suggest
then
mr.
justice
black,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
these
statements
were
true
or
not,
although
these
defendants
have
consistently
denied
they
were
untrue,
they
said
that
they
--
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
since
the
trial,
they
say
that
they
said
that
during
the
trial.
and
that
their
attorneys
did
not
put
forward
their
point
of
view.
that's
what
these
defendants
have
said.
since
their
trial,
they
said
they
said
that
during
the
trial,
and
it
shows
in
his
psychiatric
and
psychological
report
some
of
which
start
only
three
days
after
the
trial,
taken
at
the
state
prison
by
the
state
psychiatric
experts,
that
they
complained
that
it
was
not
a
robbery,
that
he
was
there
for
--
to
get
--
in
connection
with
narcotics.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
well,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
seem
to
comport
with
part
of
it
but
in
understanding
the
reduced
psychological
and
the
psychiatric
capacity
of
these
individuals
is
what
this
record
shows,
that
i
wonder
that
--
although,
not
a
question
of
sanity,
but
yet
a
question
of
knowing
--
anything
“knowingly”
or
“intelligently”,
i
would
think
that
your
question
poses
something
different.
these
defendants
say
that
they
never
authorized
their
lawyers
to
make
this
type
of
statements.
and
in
fact,
they
denied
that
it
was
correct
and
they
didn't
want
it
to
be
this
way.
and
ever
since
that
time,
they've
been
trying
to
get
this
evidentiary
hearing
which
they've
never
received.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
yes,
they
were
there.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
i
don't
--
i
can't
answer
that
mr.
justice
clark.
i
believe
that
there
was
some
comment,
but
this
point
i
can't
say
what
it
was.
i
know
that
as
soon
as
the
psychi
--
the
first
thing
in
the
record
is
in
the
psychiatric
and
psychological
material
which
is
taken
by
the
state
experts.
and
from
that
moment
on,
they
denied
that
--
that
there
was
a
robbery
and
they
say
that
they
didn't
want
to
take
the
stand.
and
in
their
point
of
view,
they
contest
it.
also
to
be
clear
too,
as
far
as
these
two
defendants
are
concerned,
their
counsel
did
not
take
the
appeal
nor
argue
any
motions
on
appeal.
it
was
all
done
by
the
assigned
attorney
who
was
paid
by
the
state.
and
also
on
the
final
direct
appeal,
the
final
direct
appeal
was
done
by
the
one
assigned
attorney
for
all
three
defendants
including
the
defendant
whose
confession
was
held
coerced
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeal.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
no,
sylvester
johnson
had
one
attorney.
stanley
cassidy
had
one
attorney,
and
wayne
godfrey
had
one
assigned
attorney.
and
there,
as
i
say,
only
received
a
nominal
sum
for
the
trial.
since
that
time,
the
family
nor
anyone
else
in
the
community
has
paid
any
counsel.
and
since,
we've
been
in
it,
the
facts
respecting
counsel.
we
even
put
in
the
petition
proposed
conviction
relief
which
was
in
the
transcript
before
your
honors
on
pages
6
to
10,
outlining
the
different
steps
on
counsel
and
the
changes
of
counsel.
mr.
m.
gene
haeberle
thank
you.
