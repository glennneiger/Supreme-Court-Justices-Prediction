fortas
did
the
police
know
that?
when
they
invest
--
when
they
interrogated
him?
justice
abe
fortas
there
wouldn't
be
very
likely
they
know
whether
he
was
schizoid
personality,
couldn't
they
in
the
part
of
the
submission
here?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
say
that
they
were
arrest
at
that
time,
what
do
you
mean
by
that,
was
there
a
warrant
for
their
arrest?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out,
is
this
what
you
had
in
mind
in
answer
to
justice
black's
questions,
when
you
say
they
were
arrested,
do
you
mean
that
at
that
time
there
was
conviction
of
guilt
or
do
you
mean
that
they
were
taken
into
custody
and
then
report
with
the
book
or
do
you
mean
something
else?
justice
abe

(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
about
five
hours
later,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
was
there
any
interrog
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
the
only
evidence
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
record
as
to
what
happened
in
the
case
of
johnson
in
these
five
hours?
was
he
interrogated
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
had
five
hours
between
the
so-called
arrest
and
the
time
he
was
booked?
justice
abe
fortas
cassidy,
i'm
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
was
this
a
subsequent
decision
of
the
new
jersey
courts?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
indeed,
i
--
first,
in
what
you
said
a
few
moments
earlier
that
perhaps
your
saying
that
the
probable
cause
cannot
exist
that
time,
these
seven
gentlemen
invited
the
other
gentlemen
to
accompany
them
for
a
chat
and
at
the
probable
cause
did
not
exist
until
after
they
had
had
that
chat,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words
you're
saying
that
the
first
interrogation
was
for
the
purpose
of
using
probable
cause?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
i
had
probable
cause
at
the
time
that
they
went
to
that
man's
house,
in
your
submission,
would
they
still
have
been
able
to
interrogate
him
without
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you
really
don't
put
any
stress
on
that
point?
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
whether
they
were
then
represented
by
appointed
counsel
or
public
defense
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
assert
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
do
you
recall
under
the
psychiatric
reports
spoke
of
the
defendant's
condition
as
of
the
time
that
psychiatric
examination
was
made
or
as
of
the
time
of
the
crime?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
frequently
do.
they
frequently
do
that
whatever
one
may
think
of
it
but
(inaudible)
this
treatment
leads
to
that.
but
you
say
that
this
one
purported
to
speak
as
of
the
time
that
they
examined
