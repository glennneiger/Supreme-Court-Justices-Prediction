chief
justice
earl

what
is
the
statutory
procedure
in
the
police
court
on
cases
of
this
kind?
what
is
the
court
suppose
to
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
difference
within
and
between
you
and
counsel
on
what
happen
before
the
court
in
that
occasion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
five
minutes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
your
rebuttal.
mr.
heine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
state
the
circumstances
under
which
he
was
picked
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
police
officers
were
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
seven?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask,
in
what
form
he
was
advised
of
his
rights?
what
did
they
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
this
stem
from
under
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
anybody
--
anybody
happened
to
compel
him
to
come
to
the
station
for
interrogation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
get
--
if
you
have
seven
officers
go
to
a
man's
home
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
wake
him
up
out
of
bed
and
take
him
down
to
the
police
station
without
his
--
without
--
to
ask
him
if
he's
willing
to
come
down
or
if
he's
willing
to
talk
to
them
would
seem
to
some
compulsion,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
they
designed
to
show
insanity
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
heine.

warren
sylvester
johnson
and
stanley
cassidy,
petitioner,
versus
new
jersey.
mr.
heine,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
defense
counsel
summation
that
you
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
just
read.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
5,
i
beg
your
pardon,
you
do
have
five
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
mr.
haeberle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
so
understood
the
solicitor
general
to
say
that
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
haeberle,
what
do
you
do
with
the
argument
about
mr.
heine
to
the
effect
that
at
the
trial
counsel
for
both
of
the
defendants
argued
to
the
jury
that
these
confessions
were
honorably
taken,
that
they
were
true
and
that
they
were
the
whole
truth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
they
stated
that
which
was
untrue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say
you
mean
--
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
counsel
stated
that
which
was
untrue
for
the
purpose
of
getting
an
advantage
for
his
clients?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
that
counsel
said
that
--
well,
one
reason
that
he
knew
they
were
honorably
taken
was
because
he
knew
the
--
i
think,
it
was
the
chief
detective
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
therefore
--
therefore
he
couldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
you
--
do
you
say
that
this
was
in
the
heat
of
argument,
that
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
understood
either
you,
your
associate,
or
the
district
attorney
that
the
judge
conducted
a
preliminary
hearing
on
this
before
--
before
the
trial
and
they
offered
testimony
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
offered
testimony
to
the
effect
that
these
--
these
were
properly
taken
and
that
the
defense
offered
nothing
to
the
contrary.
now,
that
doesn't
represent
the
heat
of
--
heat
trial
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
wouldn't
hear
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
years
was
that
after
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
after
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
that
--
how
long
after
the
trial
was
this
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
we're
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
when
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
