mr.
norman
heine
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
this
is
the
fourth
time
that
this
case
was
before
this
court.
this
is
the
first
time
it
was
argued
orally.
on
the
three
previous
applications
for
certiorari,
this
court
refused
certiorari,
denied
it.
and
if
anything
we
don't
want
this
case
to
be
decided
in
a
hypothetical
factual
situation.
three
and
a
half
days
after
the
victim
davis
was
murdered,
cassidy,
one
of
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
here,
was
picked
up
by
the
police
for
questioning,
not
arrested,
he
was
picked
up
at
4:00
a.m.
in
the
morning.
he
was
taken
to
police
headquarters
for
questioning.
mr.
norman
heine
the
police
officers
went
to
his
home
and
asked
him
to
accompany
them
to
police
headquarters
to
be
questioned
about
an
alleged
robbery-murder.
no
warrant
was
issued.
there
was
no
warrant
of
arrest.
mr.
norman
heine
yes.
mr.
norman
heine
didn't
have
to
go.
mr.
norman
heine
i
think
it
was
testified
to
either
five
or
seven.
mr.
norman
heine
they
were
looking
--
they
were
looking,
they
were
looking
at
this
time
and
questioning
people
in
connection
with
a
robbery-murder.
mr.
norman
heine
they
wanted
to
question
--
they
had
some
info
--
they
had
some
information
which
led
them
to
this
suspect.
so,
they
went
to
question
him
about
--
mr.
norman
heine
but
what
information,
i'm
--
i
am
unable
and
i
don't
believe
anybody
is
able
to
this
time
say,
this
happened
in
1958.
he
was
interrogated
commencing
9
o'clock
in
the
morning.
at
the
time
and
before
he
was
interrogated,
he
was
warned
of
his
right
and
advice
that
they
had
a
right
to
remain
silent.
the
interrogation
ended
at
10:20
an
hour
and
20
minutes
thereafter.
at
which
time
or
during
which
interrogation,
he
admitted
his
part
in
a
robbery.
mr.
norman
heine
he
was
given
a
warning
in
which
the
interrogator
said
to
him,
“i
am
going
to
ask
you
some
questions
as
to
what
you
know
about
the
holdup.
but
before
i
ask
you
these
questions,
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
everything
you
tell
me
must
be
of
your
own
freewill,
must
be
the
truth,
without
any
promises
or
threats
having
been
made
to
you
or
any
other
person
at
some
future
time.
do
you
understand
what
i
have
said
to
you,
stanley?”
the
answer,
“yes,
i
understand.”
question:
“under
these
circumstances
are
you
willing
to
answer
my
questions?”
answer:
“yes.”
mr.
norman
heine
i
think
it
is
implied
in
the
statement
that
any
questions
that
you
give
us
or
any
answers
you
give
us
must
be
of
your
own
freewill.
this
is
the
same
thing
as
telling
him,
you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
norman
heine
well,
i
--
we
don't
understand.
we
don't
understand
that
all
interrogation
then
would
have
to
be
on
the
street
or
in
the
suspect's
home.
we
would
think
that
convenience
would
entitle
the
police
to
interrogate
suspects
or
other
witnesses
--
mr.
norman
heine
--
at
the
police
station.
mr.
norman
heine
we
think
we
have
a
right.
mr.
norman
heine
that's
right.
mr.
norman
heine
we
think
we
have
a
right.
mr.
norman
heine
we
think
this
an
inherent
right
in
the
police
power
of
the
state.
mr.
norman
heine
i
won't
go
so
far
as
to
say
compel
him
to
go
to
the
police
station
but
ask
him
to
come
in
to
the
police
station.
now,
whether
or
not
there's
a
right
of
compulsion
might
depend
on
whether
or
not
there
ought
to
be
a
warrant.
mr.
norman
heine
its
very
(voice
overlap)
reason.
mr.
norman
heine
this
was
never
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
heine
no.
we
don't
think
we
have
a
right
to
do
that,
to
arrest
a
man
without
probable
cause.
but
we
think
that
when
we
have
information
which
--
doesn't
rise
to
the
stature
of
probable
cause,
we
have
a
right
to
invite
him
to
be
questioned
about
it.
if
he
refuses,
then
we
have
another
problem
as
to
whether
not
we
have
sufficient
information
or
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
warrant.
mr.
norman
heine
my
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
black
is,
if
they
were
looking
for
somebody
who
might
be
involved
in
a
felony
murder,
where
the
use
of
guns
was
concerned
that
it
would
be
folly
to
send
less.
now,
--
mr.
norman
heine
--
if
he
decides
to
shoots
his
way
out
--
mr.
norman
heine
--
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
one
or
two.
mr.
norman
heine
well,
this
phase
on
it
was
never
questioned
and
never
concerned
anyone
at
the
trial.
the
question,
i
would
think
that
we
--
everyone
bothered
themselves
whereas
--
was
after
indictment,
what
difference
to
make
how
you
were
arrested
or
how
you
were
taken?
mr.
norman
heine
no.
i
won't
concede
that
there
was
an
arrest
in
the
technical
sense
if
we
ought
to
speak
of
an
arrest.
mr.
norman
heine
that's
exactly
my
position.
mr.
norman
heine
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
would
--
it
would
result
in
probable
cause
of
arrest.
mr.
norman
heine
yes.
mr.
norman
heine
that's
right.
now,
he
was
interrogated
for
this
hour
and
20
minutes
and
during
this
time
he
admitted
his
participation
of
robbery
although
did
not
(inaudible)
admit
to
his
participation
in
an
armed
robbery.
in
the
meantime,
the
officers,
the
investigation
indicated
that
he'd
had
a
knowing
part
in
the
use
of
the
guns.
they
resumed
an
interrogation
at
12:15
which
lasted
for
about
a
half
hour.
and
during
which
time,
he
now
admitted
that
he
had
possession
of
two
guns,
one
of
which
was
the
lethal
weapon.
later
on
in
about
a
15
minute
interrogation
or
10
minute
interrogation,
he
admitted
that
he
had
possession
the
night
before
of
the
lethal
weapon
and
how
he
disposed
of
it.
at
the
trial,
the
defendants
did
contest
the
issue
of
voluntariness
by
offering
any
proof
of
their
own.
the
state
followed
the
accepted
and
approved
practice
of
proving
the
voluntariness
of
the
petitioners
or
defendants'
confessions
by
proof
before
the
court
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
defendants
did
not
offer
any
proof,
contrary.
they
did
oppose
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proof,
the
state
moved
that
the
(inaudible)
--
the
confessions
be
determined
to
be
admissible
and
voluntary.
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge
made
the
determination.
the
state
then
announced
that
it
was
prepared
to
reintroduce
the
proof
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
so
that
they
can
only
pass
upon
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
at
that
time,
the
defendants
requested
and
demanded
that
the
state
need
not
reintroduce
its
proof
before
the
jury
because
they
were
willing
to
concede
that
this
issue
had
been
already
been
determined
by
the
trial
judge
should
not
be
resubmitted
to
the
jury.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
state's
case,
the
defense
rested.
they
offered
no
proof
whatsoever
on
their
behalf.
they
offer
no
evidence
by
any
other
witness.
in
their
summations,
the
defendants'
attorneys
freely
conceded
and
argued
to
the
jury
that
the
confessions
were
voluntarily
given
and
were
true.
this
was
the
thrust
of
each
of
the
defendants'
attorney's
summation
both
as
to
cassidy
as
well
as
to
johnson.
moreover,
they
admitted
their
guilt
in
summation
and
the
sole
thrust
of
the
defense
was
a
plea
for
mercy
on
behalf
of
the
jury.
mr.
norman
heine
in
addition
--
mr.
norman
heine
--
to
the
confessions?
mr.
norman
heine
yes.
mr.
norman
heine
they
--
that
will
--
they
didn't
take
the
stand.
they
admitted
that
the
confessions
were
true
that
the
statements
given
to
the
interrogator
were
true.
mr.
norman
heine
defense
--
mr.
norman
heine
yes.
on
page
270
of
the
transcript,
counsel
for
cassidy
and
his
summation
said,
“whatever
is
in
this
statement
made
by
stanley
cassidy
is
true.
i
know
it
is
true.”
later
on
he
says,
“i
know
it
is
true
because
i
a
know
chief
dube.
he
is
the
interrogator,
he
got
the
truth.”
johnson
says
in
his
summation,
johnson's
attorney
that
is.
mr.
norman
heine
that
would
be
the
first
--
my
first
reference
was
on
page
270.
my
second
reference
is
to
page
294.
johnson's
attorney
says,
“there
were
no
threats
in
speaking
about
the
confession.
there
were
no
threats.
there
was
no
attempt
to
evade.
there
was
no
trickery.
anything
that
chief
dube
asked
him
he
answered
honestly
and
truthfully.”
this
on
page
295
of
this
record.
the
jury
founds
defendant
is
guilty
without
any
recommendation
under
the
new
jersey
law,
they
received
the
death
penalty.
an
appeal
was
made
in
new
jersey
supreme
court,
a
direct
appeal,
review
the
entire
record
including
the
summation
of
counsel
and
incidentally,
and
i
don't
know
how
much
i
want
to
speak
about
that
it
--
whether
my
time
allows.
summation
of
counsel,
the
remarks
of
the
prosecutor
in
summation
was
raised
by
the
court
on
its
own
motion
and
they
concluded
to
that
--
did
not
violate
due
process.
that
it
was
within
the
framework.
and
since
there
was
no
objection,
there
was
no
objection
by
defense
counsel
at
the
trial.
they
thought
in
the
climate
and
the
atmosphere
of
that
trial,
it
could
not
have
been
harmful.
mr.
norman
heine
he
called
one
of
them
a
triggerman.
a
--
comment
about,
they
were
wearing
either
of
these
suits.
they
were
sleek.
they
went
to
cabarets.
this
was
in
the
confessions.
this
was
all
within
the
evidence.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
held,
there
were
hard
gloves
but
there
were
fair
gloves.
a
year
after
--
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
trial,
after
the
appeal
have
been
decided,
there
was
a
motion
made
or
an
application
made
for
a
new
trial
based
upon
newly
discovered
evidence.
testimony
was
taken
because
the
matter
was
referred
from
by
our
supreme
court
back
to
the
trial
judge
for
the
purpose
of
taking
testimony
on
this
application
for
a
new
trial.
there
was
a
two-day
hearing.
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
defendants
now
took
the
stand
and
claimed
that
the
confessions
were
coerced.
they
claimed
that
they
were
physically
beaten,
mentally
disturbed,
and
so
forth.
the
trial
judge
found
after
reviewing
all
the
testimony
in
a
reported
opinion
found
that
the
story
offered
by
the
defendants
was
unbelievable,
incredible,
and
denied
their
request
for
a
new
trial
because
they
did
not
submit
any
newly
discovered
evidence.
they
had
a
full
opportunity
to
contest
the
issue
of
voluntariness
at
the
original
trial.
mr.
norman
heine
they
were
then
--
no,
they
were
represented
by
their
privately
retained
counsel
at
the
original
trial
and
represented
again
by
privately
retained
counsel
on
the
motion.
none
of
these
defendants
were
indigent
and
they
had
court
appointed
attorney.
the
only
court
appointed
attorney
in
this
matter
was
the
third
defendant
who
was
not
involved
in
the
present
appeal.
mr.
norman
heine
no.
no
charge
of
incompetency,
no
charge
at
all
of
that.
although
it
wasn't
effective
representation
of
counsel.
no
such
claim
made.
our
supreme
court
reviewed
on
appeal
the
entire
record
made
on
the
claim
of
involuntariness
of
confessions
of
his
testimony
taken
at
the
year
and
a
half
afterwards
and
came
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
trial
judge.
this
was
the
first
post-conviction
application
after
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
affirmed
application
of
petitioner
was
filed
in
this
court
for
certiorari,
certiorari
was
denied.
thereafter,
quite
sometime
afterwards,
an
application
was
made
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
charging
here
again
involuntariness.
and
strangely
enough
attached
through
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
we
first
hear
about
the
psychiatric
and
psychological
reports
that
were
made
of
the
inmates
for
the
first
time
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
crime
and
after
six
months
of
incarceration
to
state
prison.
objection
was
made
by
the
state
to
any
reference
to
the
psychiatric
reports
because,
one,
they
were
never
in
the
record,
never
in
evidence.
the
authors
of
the
reports
were
never
interrogated
nor
examined
or
cross-examined.
nobody
had
an
understanding
of
what
the
psychiatric
reports
actually
meant
or
the
psychological
report.
mr.
norman
heine
that
they
had
some
antisocial
personality
and
so
forth.
no
claim
made
of
insanity.
the
claim
of
use
of
narcotics
entered
the
picture
for
the
first
time
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
but
this
was
denied
by
the
attorneys
who
represented
them.
they
didn't
hear
anything
about
narcotics
--
mr.
norman
heine
--
and
they
claim
--
mr.
norman
heine
it
could
only
--
had
only
speak
of
the
physical
condition
or
his
mental
condition
as
of
the
time
the
examination
because
he
had
no
way
of
determining
what
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
before
--
mr.
norman
heine
that's
right.
with
the
history,
however,
given
to
him
by
the
subject,
by
the
defendant
but
we
relate
it
back
as
to
what
he
was
a
year
and
a
half
ago
and
what
he
was
as
a
young
child.
the
district
judge,
the
federal
district
judge
on
the
application
for
habeas
never
reached
the
question
of
the
psychiatric
reports
or
psychological
reports
but
determined
that
on
the
record,
the
confessions
were
voluntarily
given
and
he
only
denied
the
petition
for
habeas.
appeal
was
then
taken
to
the
third
circuit,
who
again
reviewed
the
record
and
again
since
the
psychiatric
and
psychological
reports
came
up
just
because
they
were
attached
to
the
petition,
they
formed
part
of
the
record
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
again,
the
state
told
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
“do
not
consider
any
psychiatric
or
psychological
reports
because
they
are
not
part
of
the
record.”
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
judge
in
denying
habeas.
certiorari
and
appeal
was
made
to
this
court
and
again
certiorari
was
denied.
then
they
filed
an
application
for
a
post-conviction
relief
proceeding.
they
filed
an
unverified
petition
not
supported
by
any
affidavits.
there's
a
legal
argument
before
a
trial
judge
who
determines
now
that
you
haven't
made
out
a
case
on
your
petition
that
would
fall
within
the
provision
of
escobedo,
this
was
already
after
haynes
and
escobedo.
the
trial
judge
then
denied
their
petition
for
a
post-conviction
relief.
an
appeal
is
then
taken
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
here
again,
very
strange
practice
is
introduced.
they
file
affidavits
with
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
support
of
this
petition
for
post-conviction
relief.
these
affidavits
were
never
before
the
trial
judge
and
in
these
affidavits
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
says,
“we
will
consider
them
arguendo
as
if
they
had
been
filed
with
the
trial
judge.
we
don't
think
they
make
out
of
case
under
the
facts
of
escobedo."
there's
one
other
situation
that
i
think
discloses
the
whole
pattern
of
their
procedure
in
this
case.
paragraph
11
of
their
petition
filed
for
this
post-conviction
relief
says
this,
it's
very
significant
language,
“keeping
in
mind
please
that
this
is
immediately
following
haynes
and
escobedo
decisions
of
this
court.”
the
petition
says
this
and
i
quote,
“none
of
the
contentions
advanced
in
this
petition
was
raised
in
any
of
the
prior
proceedings,
each
contention
rest
upon
a
recent
development
in
the
law
or
a
newly
established
fact.”
end
of
the
quote.
the
affidavits
filed
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
i'm
not
criticizing
my
supreme
court
for
how
we
consider
that
because
they
figured
they
--
they'd
only
decide
that
they
had
no
factual
basis
and
didn't
rise
to
constitutional
requirements
anyway.
the
language
of
this
affidavits
seemed
to
(inaudible)
because
now
for
the
first
time
we
hear
that
there
was
a
request
by
someone
by
one
of
more
of
these
defendants
to
contact
their
family
and
then
we
find
that
following
escobedo
there's
an
allegation
in
this
prisoner's
affidavit
that
he
was
never
advised
and
i
quote,
“of
the
right
to
remain
silent”.
this
is
odd
language
coming
from
a
defendant
in
the
state
prison
who
has
this
seventh
or
eighth
grade
education.
mr.
norman
heine
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
yesterday's
recess,
i
believe
i
reached
the
point
in
my
statement
of
the
facts
which
indicated
that
the
petitioner's
confessions
were
admittedly
voluntary
and
admittedly
true.
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner's
guilt
was
freely
conceded
and
admitted
beyond
any
question.
the
sole
thrust
of
the
defense
of
the
trial
was
a
plea
by
their
attorneys
for
mercy
or
leniency
on
behalf
of
their
clients,
merely
for
the
purpose
of
refreshing
the
court's
recollection.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
270
of
the
record
were
cassidy's
attorney
told
the
jury
and
i
quote,
“that
the
defendants
did
not
take
the
stand
because
he
could
not
honestly
deny
that
which
is
charged.
he
did
not
take
the
stand”,
he
continued
to
say,
“to
conjure
of
stories
or
lies,
the
facts
or
as
they
--
as
they
were
presented.
that
which
he
said
has
been
introduced
as
testimony
in
this
case
and
that
which
he
said
is
true.
there
is
nothing
more
you
can
say”,
that
was
the
end
of
his
quote.
mr.
norman
heine
yes.
mr.
norman
heine
no,
i
don't
think
it
has
any
relevance
because
the
denial
that
it
was
true
at
the
trial
came
a
year
after
the
trial
for
the
first
time.
that
was
the
first
inkling
that
anyone
had
any
different
concept
of
the
voluntariness
or
the
truthfulness
of
it.
mr.
norman
heine
yes.
mr.
norman
heine
and
the
other
defense
counsel
summation,
johnson's
attorney,
in
the
summation
said,
“the
statement
of
johnson
was
truthful
and
honest.
they
have
no
testimony
whatsoever
to
change
it”.
i
also
pointed
out
yesterday
that
the
psychiatric
and
psychological
reports
that
were
referred
to
by
the
petitioners
are
not
part
of
this
record
in
this
case.
they
were
actually
not
part
of
any
record
so
far
as
being
proven
or
admitted
into
evidence.
they
were
merely
attached
to
the
petition
for
habeas
in
the
federal
district
court
and
came
up
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
way
of
printing
the
petition
for
habeas
that
was
filed
below.
objection
to
their
use
and
reference
was
made
by
the
state
in
the
district
court
and
again
in
the
court
of
appeals.
significantly,
these
reports
were
never
offered
or
even
more
or
even
made
available
to
our
state
courts.
they
never
had
them.
since
this
matter
is
a
review
of
our
state
court
opinion,
i
fail
to
see
how
they
can
be
used
or
referred
to
in
this
argument.
i
objected
to
the
inclusion
of
these
reports
in
this
record.
i
was
advised
to
note
my
objection
in
our
brief
which
we
did
on
page
10
because
the
doctors
or
the
authors
of
these
reports
were
never
examined
or
cross
examined
to
explain
their
reports.
at
the
same
time,
i
again
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
affidavits
that
were
referred
to
and
relied
upon
by
these
defendants
in
order
to
make
up
and
assert
a
factual
situation
pertaining
to
this
petition,
pertaining
to
their
claims,
as
not
being
advised
of
their
rights
to
remain
silent
that
they
were
held
incommunicado
from
their
families,
that
they
were
denied,
their
request
of
counsel
and
were
denied
the
assistance
of
counsel.
all
of
which
facts
they
now
assert
were
not
denied
or
contradicted
by
the
state
and
now
assert
them
as
being
uncontroverted
facts.
common
to
this
case
by
the
way
of
filing
of
these
affidavits
in
our
supreme
court,
the
new
jersey,
when
the
post
conviction
appeal
was
being
considered,
this
is
contrary
to
our
local
practice
and
the
state
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
these
affidavits
would
be
received
or
even
considered
by
our
supreme
court.
the
--
our
supreme
court,
that's
the
state
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
filed
in
this
record
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
346
said
this
in
their
opinion,
“on
their
appeal
to
this
court,
the
defendant
submitted
affidavits
in
support
of
their
grounds
for
relief”.
the
court's
opinion
further
points
out
that
these
allegations,
that
is
of
the
affidavits,
were
not
made
in
any
of
the
prior
proceedings
nor
in
their
present
petitions
to
the
trial
court.
the
defendants
made
these
allegations
for
the
first
time
in
their
affidavits
submitted
to
this
court,
denial
of
an
opportunity
to
counsel,
to
consult
with
an
attorney
and
failure
to
be
advised
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
or
factors
relevant
to
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
the
court
then
went
on
to
say,
“if
these
allegations
are
made
on
that
issue,
our
consideration
is
precluded
by
our
prior
judgment”.
the
state
supreme
court
had
moved
on
the
question
of
voluntariness
once
before
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
the
federal
district
court
had
ruled
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
the
question
of
voluntariness.
on
the
merits,
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
was
again
denied
by
this
court.
our
state
supreme
court
then
considered
the
proposition
that
assuming
the
affidavits
bring
the
case
into
escobedo
and
assuming
further
that
escobedo
introduces
a
new
constitutional
concept
separate
and
apart
from
the
issue
of
voluntariness
should
this
concept
be
applied
retrospectively.
this
brings
us
face
to
face
with
the
main
subject
matter
as
i
conceive
of
this
review
that
we're
arguing
today.
the
state
holds
that
escobedo
should
not
be
applied
retrospectively
and
these
are
my
reasons.
from
1951
down
to
--
down
to
and
including
escobedo,
all
held
that
incriminating
statements
obtained
in
the
absence
of
counsel
even
after
the
defendants
had
clearly
become
the
focus
of
police
investigation
and
had
request
the
counsel
was
no
constitutional
bar
to
a
valid
conviction
where
the
statements
were
not
otherwise
involuntary.
in
haynes,
this
court
said
and
they
reiterated
that
the
admissibility
of
a
pretrial
statement
depended
on
its
voluntariness
although
absence
of
warning
of
a
right
to
remain
silent,
delay
in
arraignment,
and
lack
of
opportunity
to
consult
with
the
family
and
counsel
were
factors
to
be
assessed.
therefore
we
say,
we're
still
dealing
with
the
question
of
voluntariness.
we
think
that
escobedo
is
more
akin
to
mapp
than
it
is
to
gideon.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
gideon
was
applied
retroactively,
mapp
was
not
and
either
was
griffin
of
course
versus
california
by
way
of
the
tehan
opinion.
these
are
the
factors
that
i
think
ought
to
be
considered
by
this
court
in
deciding
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
apply
this
decision
retrospectively.
one,
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
determining
process
was
seriously
impugned
in
gideon
and
not
here.
it
offends
our
sense
of
justice
to
continue
to
incarcerate
a
convicted
man
where
subsequent
considerations
cast
grave
doubts
upon
the
reliability
of
the
determination
of
guilt.
so
where
a
man
is
tried
without
a
lawyer,
we
don't
really
know
whether
he
was
guilty
or
whether
the
acts
that
he
committed
constitute
a
crime.
however
here,
the
case
in
our
case,
the
confessions
were
admittedly
voluntarily,
and
admittedly
true.
so
we
don't
have
any
question
to
concern
ourselves
on
the
reliability
of
the
conviction.
again,
i
would
point
out
that
when
gideon
overruled
betts
v.
brady
case,
only
a
few
states
still
denied
counsel
to
the
accused
in
the
trial
in
a
none
capital
case.
however,
when
escobedo
was
decided,
almost
all
of
the
states
including
our
own
state
permitted
the
introduction
of
voluntary
confessions
given
even
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
i
will
also
suggest
to
this
court
that
society
reasonably
expects
that
when
a
man
is
convicted
of
a
crime
by
a
method
not
considered
unfair
according
to
the
rules
of
law,
then
in
effect
and
approved
by
this
honorable
court,
that
that
conviction
will
stand.
and
finally,
i
would
say
and
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
retroactive
application
of
escobedo
would
invalidate
far
more
convictions
throughout
the
country
than
even
gideon
did
because
one,
we
would
invalidate
convictions
that
were
based
on
confessions,
and
as
a
part
of
that
same
kind,
we
would
also
open
the
gates
to
those
who
pleaded
guilty
based
on
the
fact
that
the
state
had
a
confession
in
their
files
and
a
trial
would
be
futile.
so
therefore,
we
wouldn't
have
no
way
of
knowing
really
what
was
the
basis
of
what
--
who
--
what
and
who
would
be
released.
for
these
reasons,
i
would
submit
to
this
respectful
court
that
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed
and
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
be
affirmed.
