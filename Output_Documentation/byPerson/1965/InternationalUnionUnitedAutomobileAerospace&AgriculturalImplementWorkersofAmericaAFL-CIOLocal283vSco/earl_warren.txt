you
may.
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
has
that
right
because
he's
an
aggrieved
party
here
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
general,
if
the
proceeding
only
deals
with
public
rights
by
this
statute
to
say
that
any
injured
party
could
appeal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
but
the
injured
person
would
be
pursuing
a
private
right
with
me
rather
than
the
public
right
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
would
be
controlling
that
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general
i'm
still
--
i'm
still
bothered
by
this
problem
if
--
when
the
statute
says
that
any
injured
party
may
appeal
and
that
an
injured
party
does
appeal,
does
the
court
of
appeals
determine
only
public
rights,
or
does
it
perceive
to
determine
on
the
record,
the
private
rights
of
the
parties
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
mr.
rauh.
