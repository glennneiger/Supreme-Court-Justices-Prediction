mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course
we
have
no
quarrel
with
mr.
rauh's
statement
of
facts
or
indeed
we
have
little
quarrel
with
number
18.
we
quarrel
correct,
the
state
as
with
53.
i
think
at
the
very
outset,
we
have
to
point
out
some
of
the
questions
have
been
painted
with
too
broad
a
brush.
in
the
first
place,
it's
not
limited
to
either
union
or
management
to
file
the
charges.
the
statute
says
anybody
could
file
it
and
indeed
even
though
18
is
out
of
this
--
in
18
these.
were
union
members,
it
was
the
union
who
filed
the
charges.
let's
get
that
straight,
number
one.
number
two,
whoever
files
a
charge
is
not
automatically
a
party
because
it's
been
the
board's
subtle
position
for
many
years
that
it
could
--
the
statement
about
the
charging
party
filing
a
charge,
it's
up
to
the
general
counsel,
the
labor
relations
act,
unlike
the
other
acts
and
to
get
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
in
a
moment,
i
will
get
to
the
amalgamated
case
and
in
that
case,
chief
justice
hughes
did
go
over
all
of
the
legislative
history
and
concluded
that
it
was
the
public
interest.
and
mr.
rauh
is
conveniently
slipped
into
saying
that
the
nlrb
is
just
an
umpire.
it's
the
opposite
of
an
umpire.
the
icc
sets
more
or
less
as
an
umpire.
but
once
the
general
counsel
decides
not
to
file,
it's
not
filed.
that's
it.
once
the
counsel
decides
to
file,
from
that
moment
on,
it's
the
general
counsel
who
is
the
prosecutor.
you
don't
have
two
prosecutors
in
a
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
complaint
is
in
his
name
and
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
controls
the
litigation
in
toto
and
his
employer,
the
federal
government
pays
for
it
in
toto.
of
course
the
charging
party
is
by
rule
of
the
board
made
a
party,
by
rule
of
the
board.
but
let's
not
stretch
that
too
far
either
because
the
rule
says
at
the
bottom
of
102.8
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
on
page
42
of
our
brief
mr.
justice
black,
that
says
but
nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
to
prevent
the
board
or
its
designated
agent
from
limiting
any
party
to
participate
in
the
proceedings
to
the
extent
of
his
interest
only.
so
from
the
very
beginning,
this
“party”
is
not
a
party
as
we
generally
understand
a
party
to
litigation
who
controls
his
portion
of
litigation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
general
counsel.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
they
dismiss
the
charge
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sure.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he's
an
aggrieved
party.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
he
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
as
it
has
been
said,
in
some
of
the
cases,
i
think
rather
loosely
becomes
a
private
attorney
general
because
it's
the
only
way
it
will
go
up.
the
general
counsel
was
not
going
against
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
that
by
the
statute
itself.
but
the
statute
on
the
other
side
left
the
other
parties
completely
without
coverage.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
the
statute
is
the
aggrieved
party
the
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
person
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
from
the
beginning
of
this,
the
general
counsel
and
the
board
can
settle
anything
at
any
time.
and
while
it
is
true
that
the
charging
party
is
listened
to,
he
doesn't
have
any
right
to
put
on
any
evidence
or
anything
else.
so
the
yardage
petitioner
is
trying
to
get
is
based
fully
on
the
fact
that
he
is
a
party
at
the
board.
he's
not
a
party
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word.
and
that
goes
all
the
way
through
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
think
that
the
important
thing
is
to
recognize
that
there
are
to
my
mind
two
cases
that
we
are
faced
with,
and
i
for
one
would
not
like
to
gloss
over
them.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
take
the
position,
he
certainly
does
not
have
the
right.
and
it's
the
board's
position
and
i
think
it's
pretty
universal
that
they're
opposed
to
it
at
every
stage,
that's
the
board's
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'm
worried
about
your
second
point
because
there
haven't
been
any
instances
that
i
know
of,
there's
such
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
type
of
one
act
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
can
tell
you,
i'd
say
that
--
most
of
them,
there
are
many
that
are
not
cited
that
aren't
reported
but
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
we
have
some
cited
in
ours
too.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
the
case
is
--
and
also
in
judge
friendly's
opinion,
he
points
it
out
that
those
are
usually
cases
where
it's
not
a
clear-cut
decision
on
either
side,
the
board.
the
board's
given
some
and
withheld
some
and
they're
not
clear-cut
cases.
now,
that's
what
the
board's
position
is.
that's
what
i
was
told
this
morning.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
come
back
to
intervention
more
or
less
the
classical
intervention
is
discretionary.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
intervention
as
a
matter
of
right
is
really
not
intervention,
you
have
made
a
party,
and
i
frankly
would
hate
to
take
away
from
the
court
of
appeals
the
right
in
the
proper
case.
and
the
reason
i
have
to
say
that
is
because
of
the
second
amalgamated
case
in
which
the
chief
justice
hughes'
case,
in
that
case
as
mr.
rauh
said
was
whether
or
not
the
union
could
go
for
contempt
on
a
clear-cut
order
of
the
board.
and
chief
justice
hughes
after
reviewing
the
legislative
history
found
that
both
houses
and
the
committees
of
both
houses
stressed
the
point
that
there
was
no
private
right
of
action.
and
in
this
opinion
for
unanimous
court,
and
incidentally
the
unanimous
court
only
26
days
after
the
argument,
said
there
could've
been
much
a
disagreement.
chief
justice
hughes
put
all
of
the
opinion
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
was
on
behalf
of
the
public.
and
he
said
that
it
seeks
enforcement
as
a
public
agent
and
not
to
give
effect
to
a
private
administrative
remedy.
this
opinion
has
been
severely
criticized
by
such
people
as
professor
jaffe
in
harvard
law
review
and
professor
davis
in
his
treatise
but
even
professor
davis
says,
it
become
deeply
embedded.
and
chief
justice
hughes
also
observed
that
so
far
it
is
apparent
that
congress
has
entrusted
to
the
board
exclusively
the
prosecution
of
the
proceedings
by
its
own
complaint
etcetera.
when
the
board
has
made
its
order
the
board
alone
is
authorized
to
take
proceedings
to
enforce
it.
then
he
goes
to
the
public
interest
and
then
he
contrasts
it
with,
chief
justice
hughes,
with
the
icc
regulations
and
says
that
they're
entirely
different.
and
finally
in
regard
to
this
private
right
which
mr.
rauh
is
so
interested
in,
in
the
last
paragraph,
chief
justice
hughes
said,
“if
the
decree
of
enforcement
is
disobeyed,
the
unfair
labor
practice
is
still
not
prevented.
the
board
will
still
remain
as
the
sole
authority
to
secure
the
prevention.”
and
i
see
no
difference
between
that
and
this.
now,
of
course,
mr.
rauh
is
right
about
this
intervening
party
and
mine
workers
against
the
eagle-pitcher
is
a
rather
difficult
decision
for
me
at
least,
1945.
the
union
complains
that
the
board
ruled
against
the
employers
and
the
employer
responds
and
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
board
sought
enforcement.
and
the
unions
were
permitted
to
intervene.
the
court
of
appeals
modified
the
order
and
decreed
enforcement
and
two
years
later,
the
board
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
to
vacate
a
portion
of
its
decree
on
back
pay
and
to
remand
it
to
the
board.
and
the
labor
union
was
again
was
permitted
to
intervene.
and
the
petition
of
the
board
was
dismissed.
the
board
did
not
apply
for
certiorari
but
the
intervening
union
petitioned
for
certiorari.
and
in
that
case,
in
a
five-to-four
decision,
a
majority
written
by
mr.
justice
roberts
and
the
minority
by
mr.
justice
murphy
as
i
remember.
but
the
majority
said,
“we
think
that
in
the
circumstances
disclosed,
the
petitioners,
though
they
could
not
have
instituted
enforcement
proceedings,
had
standing
to
seek
review
of
their
order
denying
the
board's
petition
and
preceded
to
decide
the
case,
but
in
that
language
which
i've
just
quoted,
this
court
only
cited
two
cases.
one
was
williams
against
morgan,
an
1884
case
involving
a
bondholder's
committee
of
purchasers
having
a
right
to
seek
review
of
an
order
in
a
mortgage-trustee
compensation
matter,
and
i
don't
think
that
helps
too
much.
and
in
the
second
citation
after
that
statement
is
the
first
amalgamated
case,
consolidated
edison
and
where
the
union
came
up
and
claimed
that
they
were
the
aggrieved
party
and
they
were
allowed
in
the
case.
but
the
record
in
that
case
shows
that
no
one
opposed
the
intervention
of
the
union
and
the
order
was
signed
by
a
single
judge,
so
obviously
there
was
no
question
in
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mine
workers
versus
eagle-picher.
it's
in
our
brief
but
it's
325
u.s.
339.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
at
that
stage,
i
am
not
certain.
the
position
that
this
court
would
have
taken
if
the
issue
was
raised
because
with
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brandon
asked
the
court
might
have
taken
the
position
that
they
did
not
have
a
right
to
intervene
and
it
was
error
for
the
court
to
allow
them
to
intervene.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
providing
there
are
special
circumstances
which
might
have
been
in
this
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don't
want
to
block
the
door
on
that
special
circumstance
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
can
only
say
from
experience
on
the
court.
we
have
given
settlements
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
both
have
agreed
and
they
have
signed
and
they
handed
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
panel
involved
has
agreed
to
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
without
any
exception,
without
any
exception.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
think
actually
they
could.
i
don't
see
any
reason.
once
the
case
is
lodged
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
discussions
subject
to
this
court
is
pretty
broad.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
objection
and
the
board's
objection
is
that
he
has
no
right.
once
the
board
acts,
the
board
acts
in
the
interest
of
the
government
and
the
public
interest
only.
there's
no
other
interest
involved?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
entered
the
fact
that
there
are
some
money
going
to
go
to
worker
or
what
have
you?
that's
not
the
worker's
money
until
it
gets
it
in
his
pocket.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
he's
a
party.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
am
afraid,
i'm
not
hedging
but
i
think
it's
a
combination
that
we
take
the
position
that
this
private
party
has
no
right
in
the
proceedings
for
any
purpose
as
a
party
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
entire
weight
of
the
government
is
moving.
it's
the
board,
it's
the
general
counsel,
and
the
--
well
i
guess
it's
the
old
story
about
too
many
crux
or
what
have
you.
but
our
whole
position
is
that
they
have
no
right.
and
in
this
case,
they've
shown
no
reason
of
course
for
any
other
reason
to
come
into
the
case,
once
it's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
of
any,
do
they?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
only
settlement
that
i
have
run
across
had
been
where
two
parties
have
signed.
i've
never
seen
one
with
the
third
party's
signature.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
to
settlement,
i
don't
know
what
the
rule
would
be
if
two
parties
settle
a
case
involving
three
parties.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
he
would.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
he
would.
but
the
whole
point
is
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
i
think
the
one
point
we
have
to
get
clear
is
once
this
gets
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
indeed
i
can
go
back
to
the
time
the
complaint
is
filed.
the
complainant
party
has
no
more
right.
his
right
goes
when
the
proceeding
starts.
from
then
on,
it's
the
public's
right,
it's
the
public's
interest
and
even
though
it
doesn't
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
relying
on
the
opinion
of
chief
justice
hughes
who
points
out
how
he
went
through
the
legislative
history
and
he
has
the
citations
there
and,
of
course
also,
rely
on
my
favorite
author,
among
the
court
of
appeals'
judges,
judge
friendly
and
he
found
a
case
who
also
went
into
it.
they're
convinced
that
regardless
of
what
the
state
of
labor
relations
and
what
have
you
is
today,
when
this
act
was
passed,
it
was
passed
for
this
expressed
purpose,
and
both
committees,
rather
the
committees
of
both
houses
made
it
clear
that
they
were
not
beginning
to
be
involved
in
any
private
interest
points.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
because
as
the
cases
we
have
cited,
it
gives
the
private
party
the
public
--
private
attorney-general
point.
it's
the
only
way
it'll
get
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
board's
not
going
to
take
it
up
and
the
general
counsel
is
not
going
to
take
it
up.
and
i
think
and
heard
in
the
act
is
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
board's
actions.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
but
that's
why
the
court
says
that
in
that
instance,
he's
not
a
private
individual.
he's
a
private
attorney
general.
the
--
it's
in
the
--
i
think
if
i
could
quote
from
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
the
teamsters
case,
“the
general
counsel
cannot
appeal
from
his
own
board's
decision,
the
respondent
has
no
motive
to
do
so,
and
this
portion
of
the
statute
would
thus
be
rendered
nugatory
unless
the
charging
party
was
allowed
to
come
in”.
and
i
think
that's
what
these
cases
stand
for.
the
major
one
is
the
american
newspaper
publishers,
but
that's
the
reason
for
it
but
still
it's
--
it's
in
the
public
interest.
it's
in
the
public's
interest
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
board
did
find
or
did
not
find
it.
but
i
don't
think
that
helps
in
the
other
instance
at
all,
because
the
case
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
assume
that
the
general
counsel
is
not
going
to
make
as
good
a
presentation
as
mr.
rauh,
at
least
he'll
try
to.
and
the
record
--
as
they're
designating
the
record,
in
most
of
the
cases,
i
run
across,
the
whole
record
goes
up
anyhow.
but
at
some
places,
they
do
designate
the
record.
i
think
also
on
the
question
that
he
raise
about
going
back
to
the
board,
provided
the
case
is
sent
back
to
the
board
and
that
he
will
automatically
have
a
right
to
come
up,
i'm
not
too
sure
he
does.
but
even
if
he
does,
he
admits
that
the
law
of
the
case
would
have
been
settled
before
he
gets
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
that
i
know
of
at
that
court.
the
board
says,
they
do
not
know
of
it.
and
this
amalgamated
case
has
been
on
books
since
40,
since
1940.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
like
to
say
that
on
that
--
the
only
thing
i
could
say
about
that
is
that
professor
cox
who
wrote
the
--
who
made
the
original
study
when
he
became
solicitor
general
cox,
approved
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
these
particular
cases.
and
since
i
happen
to
know
some
of
the
names
that
were
mentioned
in
regards
to
a
question
earlier,
i
can
guarantee
you
without
having
to
read
all
the
proceedings
that
they
were
not
all
in
agreement
on
any
one
point.
and
i
--
do
you
agree
with
it?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
scheme
of
the
statute
is
their
public
rights.
and
the
--
i
think
the
best
way
we
come
to
grips
is
that
they're
back
pay
cases
where
they
find
the
management
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
order
them
to
do
this,
this,
this
and
to
pay
back
pay
in
blank
dollars
to
blank
men.
that's
still
public,
it's
not
private
until
that
money
actually
gets
to
it
because
the
board
has
given
authority
once
they
issue
that
order.
they
might
still
cut
it
down.
there's
still
negotiation.
there's
still
possibility
of
settlement.
and
even
when
it
gets
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
possibility
of
settlement
in
the
public
interest
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
not
as
to
whether
a,
b,
c
gets
a
hundred
bucks.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
he
loses
something.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
the
benefit
of
whatever
the
charging
party
has
to
offer,
that
can
be
covered
to
a
certain
extent
by
brief
amicus
which
is
usually
granted,
very
seldom
that
the
courts
of
appeals
allow
argument
on
which
he
just
filed
a
brief
amicus.
but
you
see,
obviously,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
want
more
than
to
give
to
the
court
of
appeals
their
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
they
--
no
sir,
they
want
to
argue
in
addition
to
what
general
counsel
is
going
to
argue.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
could
they
have
in
addition
to
what
general
counsel
has?
general
counsel
is
representing
the
prosecution.
he
must
know
as
much
as
they
know,
he's
tied
to
the
record.
he
can't
go
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
or
whether
he
could
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
whether
he
could
in
his
own
personal
interest
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
take
for
example
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
now,
if
the
board
loses,
the
board,
on
the
advice
of
the
general
counsel
decides
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
apply
for
certiorari.
once
that
decision
is
made,
they
then
come
to
the
solicitor
general
to
find
out
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
petition
for
certiorari.
but
certainly
this
third
party
wouldn't
be
required
to
come
to
the
solicitor
general.
and
he
held
the
public
interest
case
would
be
in
the
hands
of
a
private
individual.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
would
be
very
difficult
under
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
could
go
into
that
very
great
detail.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
i
think
the
--
well,
to
sum
up,
i
think
number
one,
this
court
should
make
it
quite
it
clear
that
there
is
no
right
to
intervene
as
a
party,
and
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
wants
to
leave
the
court
of
appeals
with
some
discretion.
i
think
that's
up
to
the
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i'm
worried
about
that
case
where
--
well,
to
put
it
simply
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
and
i
checked
incidentally
mr.
justice
--
when
i
checked
on
the
new
proposed
rules
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
new
appellate
rules,
they
follow
the
general
rule
which
doesn't
intend
to
give
anybody
any
right
to
intervene,
just
a
general
language
that's
in
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
just
that
it
is
in
the
regular
rules
of
the
courts,
the
individual
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
the
party
may
intervene
by
filing
this,
this,
and
this
and
leave
them
to
the
whole
jurisdiction,
i
mean
discretion
to
the
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
the
point
that
i'm
worried
about
is
the
case
where
the
union
asked
for
a
100%,
and
gets
the
65%.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
a
real
good
solid
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
issue
there.
that's
the
one
i'm
worried
about
but
i've
also
find,
if
i
may
say
so
that
a
lot
of
bad
rules
are
made
and
looking
forward
to
cases
that
might
never
come
up.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
because
of
the
--
most
of
the
cases
have
gone
the
other
way.
indeed
they,
this
is
the
first
time
they've
gone
this
far.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
the
--
the
point
has
been
made
and
suggested
--
if
we
take
all
of
these
other
rights,
to
weigh
the
right,
to
block
settlement,
the
right
to
petition
etcetera
is
in
fact
back
to
the
status
of
amicus
curiae.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oral
argument
--
oral
argument.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
about
--
did
we
got
it
here?
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
on
the
basis
of
that,
with
the
brief
and
with
the
one
explanation,
the
appendix
which
has
all
of
the
different
materials
from
the
different
agencies,
i
would
like
to
advise
the
court
that
that
material
was
obtained
from
the
agencies
by
letters
from
the
solicitor
general
and
correspondents
back
and
forth.
and
we
have
in
the
files
those
letters
providing
anybody
who
would
need
them.
and
the
final
point
is
that
bear
in
mind,
if
you
will,
the
first
part
of
our
appendix
where
we
set
out
the
number
of
cases
involved
from
different
agencies,
when
we
try
to
lump
nlrb
with
all
the
other
governmental
agencies,
this
problem
is
a
pretty
tough
one,
and
i
believe
it
is
a
right
for
the
court
to
decide.
and
number
one,
of
course
in
18
to
reverse,
and
in
the
other
one,
53
to
affirm
and
make
the
rule
crystal
clear
as
to
what
it
has
already
been
in
most
of
the
circuit,
unless
there
are
further
questions.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
gain
considerable
support
from
the
other
side.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
but
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
especially
with
one
judge
signed
it,
a
single
judge
signed
the
order
and
i
--
we
went
back
to
the
briefs
and
all
and
i'm
just
in
a
loss
as
to
it,
but
i
--
i
couldn't
at
least,
i
couldn't
ignore
it.
but
i
don't
think
it's
in
any
way
overrule
amalgamated
at
all.
i
don't
think
it
begins
to
overrule
it
and
i
don't
think
it
touches
the
public
interest
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
have
had
long
gone
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
they've
gone
both
ways
on
that.
the
courts
have
--
i
have
seen
them
go
both
ways
on
that
and
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
on
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
this
is,
once
it
--
they
have
alleged
in
their
action,
as
i
understand
it,
that
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
nlrb
has
taken
jurisdiction
of
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
picked
the
forum,
the
union
picked
the
forum.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
think
once
you
picked
the
forum
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
white,
that
--
they're
arguing
on
that
point
just
as
bad
as
the
other
argument.
once
they
picked
the
forum,
they
don't
control
the
rules
of
the
forum.
and
once
they
become
a
party
in
the
board
hearing,
that
does
not
carry
through.
i
mean
they
picked
the
forum,
they
came
into
the
nlrb.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
say,
that's
the
law
of
case,
and
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
yes,
the
union
is
--
was
the
union
--
the
union
never
asked
for
a
hearing.
the
union
asked
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
they
didn't
start
off
with
it.
they
asked
the
general
counsel
to
represent
them
and
prosecute
this
case,
that's
what
they
asked
for,
and
that
they
got.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
are
there
any
other
question?
thank
you
sir.
