mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
consolidated
argument
of
case
number
18,
scofield,
and
case
number
53,
fafnir.
18
at
scofield,
raises
the
question
whether
a
union
which
is
charged
with
unfair
labor
practices
before
the
labor
board
and
wins
its
case
before
the
labor
board
and
has
that
charged
dismissed
can
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
those
who
had
charged
it
and
seek
to
have
it
held
in
violation
of
the
labor
act
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
this
of
course
would
be
the
same
if
the
management
were
on
the
other
side,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
refused
us
intervention
in
that
respondent
case.
53
fafnir
differs
only
that
the
uaw
was
the
charging
party,
not
the
respondent
before
the
board
as
in
scofield.
fafnir
thus
raises
the
question
whether
when
the
union
charges
management
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
wins
before
the
board,
and
management
then
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals,
whether
we
can
intervene
in
those
circumstances
and
of
course
it
would
be
the
same
if
it
was
reversed.
here,
the
second
circuit
also
denied
us
intervention.
now
the
government's
position
is
a
strange
one.
they
say
we're
right
in
number
18,
where
we
were
the
respondent
before
the
board
but
we
are
wrong
in
number
53
where
we
were
the
charging
party
before
the
board.
we,
of
course,
agree
on
scofield,
we
disagree
on
fafnir
and
we
say
that
the
government's
own
reasoning
shows
that
the
result
should
be
the
same.
i'd
like
to
do
scofield
only
briefly
because
it's
not
in
dispute,
but
i
do
want
to
state
it
and
then
go
on
to
fafnir.
facts
of
scofield
are
these;
a
number
of
union
members
employed
at
the
wisconsin
motor
corporation
filed
a
charged
against
our
union
under
8(b)(1)(a)
saying
that
fines
we
had
imposed
on
membership
for
exceeding
production
and
pay
ceilings
violated
the
labor
act.
a
complaint
was
issued
against
us,
a
hearing
was
held
on
which
we
were
the
party
defendant,
we
won
the
case.
the
board
dismissed
the
complaint
completely.
the
employees
went
to
the
seventh
circuit
asking
that
the
seventh
circuit
adjudge
us
in
violation
of
the
labor
act.
we
asked
to
when
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
precise
order
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir,
they
wanted
an
order
saying
in
so
finding.
they
asked
the
court
to
find
that
we
had
violated
the
labor
act
and
to
order
us
to
cease
and
desist
doing
so.
we
were
asked
for
intervention,
we
were
denied,
we
asked
for
a
rehearing,
we
were
denied
and
that
brought
the
--
in
this
court
granted
certiorari.
now,
this
seems
to
me
a
simple
case
and
as
i
say,
the
board
and
the
solicitor
general
support
intervention.
in
simplest
terms,
scofield
case
involves
a
question
with
the
silence
of
congress
on
our
right
of
intervention
because
there's
no
reference
to
it
in
the
act,
should
be
interpreted
in
one
way
or
another.
and
the
government
agrees
with
us
that
this
court
under
its
supervisory
power
over
the
lower
court
should
allow
us
to
intervene
in
this
scofield
situation.
namely,
where
we
are
the
respondent
before
the
board
where
an
order
would
issue
against
us
if
the
court
of
appeals
reverse
the
board.
this
seem
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
was
a
rather
mix
up,
if
your
honor
please.
the
board
supported
intervention.
we
thought
the
other
side
was
supporting
intervention,
these
employees.
they
later
told
us
they
had
only
supported
amicus
curiae.
so
i
think
i'd
have
to
say
that
the
employees
opposed
it
at
the
stage.
they
are
not
participating
in
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they're
not
here
your
honor
either
by
brief
or
oral
argument.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
are
--
yes,
they're
the
--
they're
the
appellant.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
are
the
appellant
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
there
--
and
the
board
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they're
the
petitioner
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
board
is
the
respondent
and
we
sought
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
the
board
said
fine,
but
they
said
--
they
told
us
later
they
did
oppose
it.
we
had
representatives
of
the
board,
they
supported
it
and
we're
--
to
the
court,
they
support
it,
we
were
denied
anyway,
but
they
later
told
us
they
had
only
met
the
support
or
request
--
only
had
met
them
--
let
us
come
in
as
amicus.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
do
not
think
they
--
i'm
not
saying
they
changed
their
position.
they
may
not
be
enough
interest
to
them,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
only
wanting
to
tell
you
about
it
because
i
want
to
show
you
later
the
other
case
is
the
same.
this
is
not
in
dispute
before
this
court.
and
it
couldn't
be,
really,
because
there's
a
very
serious
due
process
question
here
if
they
were
--
we
were
to
be
denied.
we're
the
defendant,
a
compulsory
order
could
issue
against
us,
we're
entitled
to
be
heard,
it
seems
to
pretty
clearly
on
this
court's
decisions
that
there's
a
serious
due
process
question
whether
we
could
be
kept
out
and
obviously,
this
court
is
not
going
to
interpret
the
statute
to
raise
it.
furthermore
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
we
feel
that
this
court
should
--
in
its
opinion,
made
clear
that
on
the
request
for
intervention,
we
should
be
permitted
in
and
it's
not
a
matter
of
discussion.
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
over
the
court
of
appeals
would
seem
to
warrant
this
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
guess
it's
both,
your
honor,
i
believe.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
might
be
and
then
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
might
be
when
you
are
--
actually,
i
don't
--
it
may
be
just
a
matter
of
semantics
between
us.
when
you're
exercising
a
power
of
supervision,
you
have
a
right
to
consider
the
due
process
clause
as
requiring
this.
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
really
differing
with
you.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
either
event,
you
would
have
the
right
to
--
you'll
have
the
duty
since
it
raises
a
due
process
issue.
furthermore,
there's
an
obvious
administrative
problem
that
if
you
didn't
let
us
in,
it's
going
to
--
it
would
make
a
terrible
mess
of
things.
suppose
in
the
scofield
case,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said
to
--
they
reversed
without
us
being
a
party.
then
it
goes
back
to
the
board
and
orders
entered
directing
us
to
do
certain
things,
obviously
we
can
appeal
that.
we
appeal
that
back
to
the
same
court
of
appeals.
it's
a
totally
futile
gesture
but
we
have
our
right
to.
then
we
come
to
this
court
with
a
petition
for
cert,
and
you
don't
have
a
charging
party.
in
other
words,
what
this
court
said
in
the
united
states
v.
louisiana
that
you
like
all
the
interested
parties
before
the
court,
you
can
only
get
in
this
cert.
so
anyway,
as
i
say
this
case
is
not
an
issue,
i
was
interested
in
it
only
to
show
the
background
for
the
real
case
before
you
number
53,
fafnir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
most
cases
that,
in
all
--
in
most
cases,
they
have
allowed
intervention,
as
a
matter
fact,
the
government's
brief
called
this
aberrational.
i
don't
know
that
i
would
have
gone
quite
that
far
because
we've
been
denied
in
other
places
but
certainly
the
bulk
of
the
time
where
you've
been
the
respondent,
you
have
been
given
intervention.
now
turning
to
fafnir,
the
bulk
of
the
times,
we
had
been
the
charging
party.
we
have
not
been
admitted,
but
at
many
cases
we
have
without
discussion.
in
other
words,
it's
a
mess.
the
courts
have
been
going
both
ways
without
a
clarification.
in
fact,
you've
been
asked
to
clarify
those
problems
before
but
have
denied
cert,
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
directly
looked
at
this
problem.
but
as
i'll
show
you,
you
have
looked
indirectly
at
the
problem
before.
now,
turning
to
fafnir
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
which
was
granted
last
year,
last
term.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
although
we
had
considered
adding
a
possibility
of
a
common
law
read
under
the
all
writ
clause
but
we
thought
that
you
did
have
this
power
and
apparently,
the
court
agreed
when
it
did
grant
certiorari,
that
under
1254
(1),
it
is
a
proper
ground
here.
now,
turning
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
litigated
in
number
53,
it
could
be
raised
in
53,
if
the
government
disagreed
with
us,
they
had
the
right
to
raise
it
at
53,
which
they
have
not
done.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
no
sir.
there's
no
time
problem
with
us
at
all.
we
did
it
right,
it's
a
matter
of
days
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
all
of
these
things.
these
are
rather
easy
petitions
to
prepare
and
they
were
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
this
was
a
matter
of
days
in
all
of
these
things.
turning
now
if
i
may
to
18
--
to
53,
the
fafnir
case
where
we
say
the
considerations
are
going
to
prove
to
be
the
same,
that
it's
a
question
of
interpreting
the
silence
of
congress,
a
question
of
your
supervisory
authority,
all
of
which
the
government
has
conceded
in
number
18.
and
as
we
shall
see,
the
union's
interest
is
just
as
great
in
53
as
it
is
in
18.
and
indeed,
this
is
the
important
area.
the
government
has
given
this
kind
of
a
neutral
business,
they
let
us
in
18,
they
won't
let
us
in
53.
well,
i
must
say
that
this
neutrality
is
sort
of
like
one
horse
and
one
rabbit.
fafnir
is
90%
of
the
cases
because
in
90%
of
the
cases,
the
board
does
grant
some
relief
and
this
is
in
their
brief,
the
government's
brief,
the
90%
figure.
and
therefore,
90%
of
the
cases
involve
fafnir.
the
scofield
case
is
very
important.
the
fafnir
case
is
terribly
important
because
in
the
bulk
of
the
cases,
the
board
does
grant
some
relief,
the
appellant
is
the
person
against
to
the
petitioner
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
person
against
whom
relief
runs,
and
if
the
union
is
going
--
the
charging
union's
going
to
be
kept
out
of
that,
they're
out
of
the
review
proceedings
because
that
is
the
cases
that
you
have.
in
other
words,
it's
perfectly
simple.
it's
like
in
indictment.
the
board
doesn't
issue
complaints
unless
there
is
a
good
case
most
of
the
time.
so
that
you
don't
--
you
get
remedial
orders
and
the
question
is,
whether
we
are
going
to
get
in
and
i'm
going
to
try
to
show,
time
allotted
to
me
that
these
cases
are
really
the
same
and
that
every
consideration
in
scofield
accept
the
due
process
consideration
applies
equally
in
fafnir.
now,
the
facts
of
fafnir
were
these,
we
as
a
union
have
a
contract,
the
automobile
workers
with
the
fafnir
bearing
company.
this
contract
provides
that
the
company
will
set
standard
production
rates,
and
we
get
incentive
pay
above
the
standard
production
rates.
we
have
a
right
to
file
a
grievance
when
we
feel
the
standard
production
rates
are
--
demand
too
much
of
the
workers
that
there
really
isn't
a
standard,
that
they're
really
holding
them
up
to
too
much
and
that
reduces
the
incentive
pay.
four
cases
at
fafnir,
we
were
going
to
--
we're
considering
taking
to
the
grievance
procedure.
we
looked
at
their
time.
our
engineers
looked
at
their
time
studies,
the
fafnir
time
studies.
we
said,
“they're
no
good.
we
want
to
make
our
own
time
studies
to
decide
whether
to
go
to
grievance.”
the
company
said,
“oh,
you
can't
bring
any
engineers
in
this
plant
and
look
it
over.”
we
said,
“well
we
have
a
right
under
the
statute,
a
right
of
collective
bargaining,
a
right
to
do
this.”
and
we
filed
a
charge
on
the
ground
that
we
had
a
right
to
make
time
studies
and
the
company
had
denied
us
that
right
to
make
our
own
time
studies.
now,
complaint
was
issued
by
the
board,
a
hearing
was
held
to
which
we
were
a
party,
not
even
having
to
intervene.
the
board's
rules
specifically
put
us
in
as
a
party
without
anything
we
do.
we
just
--
we're
a
party
automatically
because
we
started
it
and
they
couldn't
have
even
gone
ahead
without
the
charge.
well,
we
lost
in
front
of
the
trial
examiner.
we
filed
exceptions
along
with
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
and
went
before
the
board
and
we
won.
the
board
said
in
so
many
words
that
fafnir
has
to
let
our
people
in
to
make
time
studies
so
that
in
the
time
studies,
we
can
determine
whether
to
go
to
the
--
to
grievance
procedure
about
whether
these
standard
production
rates
demand
too
much
of
the
workers.
we
petitioned
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
friendly,
in
a
--
his
opinion
and
there
is
an
opinion
in
that
case,
not
in
the
other
one,
judge
friendly
hold
against
us
what
he
said,
“this
debatable.”
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
torn
both
ways.
i
suppose
i
should
start
my
argument
with
the
only
comprehensive
study
that's
been
made
at
this
problem
which
is
referred
to
on
pages
16
and
17
of
our
green
brief
which
is
the
brief
in
number
53,
fafnir.
this
was
study
was
headed
by
professor
archibald
cox
and
i
had
plan
to
rather
push
this
thing
down
his
throat,
but
he's
not
here,
the
previous
capacity.
but
on
his
committee,
he
sure
had
some
interesting
people
to
make
this
study.
he
had
both
sides,
management
and
laborer,
he
had
the
leaders
of
both
sides,
he
had
two
secretaries
of
labor,
goldberg
and
wertz.
he
had
two
--
he
had
the
leading
students
of
the
subject
in
the
mediation,
cole
and
taylor.
he
had
lawyers,
he
had
former
board
chairman,
former
members
riley.
he
had
professors,
russell
smith
and
gregory,
he
had
the
whole
panel
of
labor
lawyers
from
the
most
conservative
to
the
most
liberally,
dennis
and
kitchell
on
the
conservative
side.
he
had
for
example
louis
sherman
who
is
the
labor
metal
trades
group.
so
in
other
words,
this
was
a
most
remarkable
body
that
had
been
asked
to
study
this
among
other
questions
and
they
just
unanimously
said,
“we
also
believed
--”,
and
this
is
on
the
bottom

of
our
brief,
“we
also
believed
that
any
party,
the
nrlb
proceedings
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
appellate
proceedings.”
and
then
they
explained
it
on
page
17,
they
say,
“although
proceedings
before
the
board
are
undertaken
on
the
public
interest
since
1947,
they
have
been
concerned
with
the
vindication
of
essentially
private
rights.”
board
is
no
longer
charged
solely
with
promoting
the
spread
of
labor
unions
and
collective
bargainings,
largely
an
umpire
engaged
and
enforcing
established
rules,
first
against
the
union,
then
against
the
management.
in
other
words,
there
has
been
one
study
of
this
subject.
it
was
by
a
remarkably
divergent
group
of
all
of
the
people
interested
in
this
whole
field
and
headed
by
professor
cox,
and
it
urges
this
result.
now,
as
this
very
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
the
report
does
not
indicate
any
on
this
--
on
this
matter
sir.
now
this
--
this
very
distinguished
panel
said
there
are
very
real
private
rights
and
private
interest
involved
here.
section
7
of
the
labor
act,
in
so
many
words,
refers
to
the
private
rights
of
collective
bargaining
which
is
exactly
what
they
refer
to
it
as
a
right
of
collective
bargaining
which
is
exactly
what
the
board
said
we
had
here,
a
right
for
time
studies
as
part
of
our
collective
bargaining.
in
fact,
the
board's
opinion
is
kind
of
humorous
in
this
respect,
12
times
in
the
board's
opinion
in
fafnir
refers
to
the
statutory
right
of
the
union
to
have
this,
these
time
studies.
and
this
is
a
--
i
can't
tell
you
how
important
this
kind
of
thing
is
to
enforcing
our
collective
bargaining
contract
with
fafnir.
we
are
about
to
have
a
--
are
we
to
go
--
whether
we're
to
have
to
go
into
a
grievance
blind
or
whether
we
have
a
right
to
do
this
as
a
terribly
important
thing
to
our
union.
now,
this
court
continually
recognizes
the
private
rights
or
interest
of
unions.
for
example,
review
of
the
collective
bargaining
unit
this
court
has
reviewed.
that
was
our
private
right
to
--
of
a
union
to
have
a
fair
bargaining
unit.
that
of
course
was
leedom
and
kyne.
it
recognizes
301
rights
under
collective
bargaining
contracts.
in
other
words,
there
are
private
rights
and
look
if
i
may
call
your
attention
to
the
name
of
the
statute
under
what
we
--
we
are
operating,
the
47
taft-hartley
but
the
real
name
of
that
is
labor
management
relations
act,
that's
what
this
panel
was
talking
about.
there's
a
labor
management
relations
with
the
board
as
the
umpire
but
they're
very
real
private
rights
on
the
side
of
both
of
the
labor
and
management
here.
now,
of
course,
these
private
rights
and
private
interest
must
be
considered
within
a
framework
of
the
public
interest.
there
is
just
no
question
about
it.
the
board
is
umpiring
labor
and
management
rights,
but
it's
doing
it
in
the
public
interest.
but
this
public
interest
concept,
we
submit,
is
only
a
shorthand
way
of
referring
to
those
aspects
of
the
act
relating
to
the
exclusivity
of
the
board's
jurisdiction
and
procedures.
it
does
not
imply
the
absence
of
private
interest
or
private
claims
within
the
public
arena,
and
there,
i
submit,
is
the
reconciliation
of
all
the
discussion
of
whether
it's
public
rights
or
private
rights.
and
there,
i
submit,
is
the
reconciliation
of
the
all
the
discussion
of
whether
it's
public
rights
or
private
rights.
it
is
obviously
both.
the
board
is
trying
to
protect
the
public
interest
but
it
is
trying
to
protect
it
as
the
umpire
but
with
between
very
serious
and
important
rights
and
interest
of
both
sides.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
every
consideration
of
judicial
administration
here
favors
intervention.
the
first
place
where
again
you
get
this
multiplicity
of
litigation
difficulty,
suppose
we
lose,
not
being
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
fafnir
case.
they
say,
“no,
fafnir
doesn't
have
to
let
your
people
in
to
make
these
time
studies.
we
go
back
to
the
board,
the
board
dismisses
the
complaint.
under
10
(f),
we
clearly
have
the
right
to
appeal
again
because
we
will
have
been
a
party
aggrieved.
now,
the
government
says,
“well,
that's
silly.
you
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
appeal
again.”
but
the
statue
says,
“anybody
who
is
a
party
aggrieved
to
any
board
order
can
appeal.
the
board
will
be
dismissing
our
complaint,
we
come
back.”
now,
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
would
hold
the
same
way.
we're
aware
that
that
would
be
filled.
but
then
we
petition
for
certiorari
here
and
you
wouldn't
have
the
respondent.
again,
you'd
be
in
the
position
of
not
having
all
the
parties
as
you
said
you
wanted
in
united
states
v.
louisiana
and
that
can
happen
in
fafnir,
and
i
want
to
tell
you
why.
there's
a
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
the
otis
elevator
case
previous
to
the
fafnir
decision,
exactly
contrary
to
two
to
one
decision
by
the
second
circuit
saying
that
we
have
no
right
to
the
time
study
information.
so
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
very
important
thing
to
us
to
get
in
front
of
the
second
circuit
to
try
to
persuade
them
not
to
follow
their
own
decision
in
a
previous
case
involving
the
otis
elevator
company
and
this
problem
has
never
been
resolved
by
this
court
and
it's
an
important
problem
and
we
would
be
back
here
with
a
petition
for
cert
in
a
place
where
the
respondent
was.
in
other
words,
if
you're
going
to
get
all
the
parties
here
the
first
time,
you're
going
to
have
a
better
opportunity
at
this.
well
secondly,
i'm
looking
at
the
consideration.
look
at
this,
we
as
the
charging
party
are
an
automatic,
an
automatic
party
below.
what
the
board
is
saying
to
this
court
is
we
need
the
charging
party
to
help
us
decide
but
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't.
that's
the
most
inconsistent
thing.
the
board
which
is
an
expert
needs
us
to
help
make
the
decision
but
the
court
of
appeals
that
has
ten
labor
board
cases
a
year,
doesn't
need
us.
i
would
think
of
either
--
it
would
be
the
other
way
around
that
if
were
so
all
far
important
to
the
board,
that
they
were
an
automatic
party
without
intervention
because
they
want
our
help
in
resolving
these
questions
that
somehow
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
consider
us.
well,
there
are
--
we
have
in
the
brief
in
scofield
a
number
of
other
arguments
of
policy
considerations
through
analogy,
the
rule
of
civil
--
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
contract
problem,
but
i
rather
just
--
to
my
mind,
it's
easier
to
state
it
this
way.
the
board
concede
scofield
but
our
interest
is
just
as
great
here
as
in
scofield.
we
have
as
much
at
stake.
we
have
as
big
an
interest
and
the
way
to
prove
this
is
to
look
at
fafnir
and
see
what
would
happened
if
it
had
gone
the
other
way.
suppose
in
53
in
fafnir,
the
board
had
said,
“no,
you
are
not
entitled
to
the
time
studies.”
then
we
would
have
been
the
appellant,
the
petitioner
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
fafnir
would
have
been
the
intervener,
the
company.
the
board
says,
“oh,
that's
fine.
fafnir
could
come
in
as
a
--
intervener
as
the
respondent
but
you
union,
you
can't
come
in
as
a
charging
party.”
well,
you
know
what
that
brings
the
distinction
down
to?
that
if
you're
claiming
you
have
a
right
to
put
time
study
engineers
in
the
plant,
you
can't
intervene
if
you
win,
but
if
you
claim
you
have
a
right
as
management
not
to
put
time
study
engineers
in
the
plant,
then
if
you
win,
you
can
intervene.
this
is
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
the
issue
in
fafnir
is
whether
the
union
can
put
time
study
engineers
in
the
plant.
if
we
won
the
case,
we
ought
to
have
a
right
to
ascertain
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
want
to
put
time
study
engineers
in
the
plant
just
as
if
--
if
the
company
won
the
case,
they
ought
to
have
a
right
to
put
--
to
argue
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
--
that
we
shouldn't
put
time
study
engineers
in
their
plant
but
what
the
board
is
now
saying
is,
“oh,
the
company
can
argue
that
you
shouldn't
put
time
study
engineers
at
the
plant
but
you
union,
you
have
on
any
right
to
argue
that
you
shouldn't.”
i
just
say
it's
the
same
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
the
government
really
doesn't
challenge
any
of
this.
they
don't
come
to
grips
with
this.
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
precisely
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
correct.
that
is
the
government's
position.
that's
exactly
where
i
wanted
to
go,
what
the
government
says,
what
the
say
is,
“if
we
intervene,
we
can
block
settlement.”
that's
really
what
the
government's
case
comes
down
to,
that
if
we
are
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
charging
party
and
fafnir,
we
block
settlements.
and
we
--
and
therefore,
we
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
intervene.
well,
my
answers
to
that
are
several.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
a
very
speculative
question
whether
there
are
all
these
settlement
and
in
fact,
if
you
look
--
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
fortas,
on
page
28,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
place,
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
government
even
states
it
this
way,
“if
we
were
a
party,
we
could
conceivably
force
a
continuation
of
the
proceeding.”
well,
i
don't
think
that
speculation
is
grounds
for
denying
us
intervention
but
i'm
willing
to
answer
it
this
way.
as
the
law
now
stands,
we
couldn't
block
settlement
and
my
proof
of
this
is
the
government
because
on
page
17
of
the
government's
brief,
they
point
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
that
they
can
compromise
cases
before
the
board.
but
we're
a
party
before
the
board
and
if
they
can
compromise
cases
when
we're
a
party
before
the
board,
why
can't
they
compromise
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
we're
a
party?
we're
no
different
before
the
board
where
we
are
a
party
and
they
claim
the
right
to
compromise.
now,
all
i
would
say
is,
this
is
a
premature
question
whether
in
fact,
if
we
were
--
because
the
court
of
appeals
are
split
on
this
and
this
court
hasn't
held
--
this
court
hasn't
decided
the
question,
the
cases
are
set
forth
in
footnote
18,
in
footnote
10
of
the
board's
brief
on
page
18.
but
those
cases
are
in
conflict.
the
board
has
a
little
cf
in
there
but
the
cf
is
a
conflict
between
the
marine
engineers
case
and
the
other
cases.
i'm
not
answering
that.
i
don't
know
where
the
law
ultimately
will
be
as
to
the
board's
right
to
compromise
without
the
consent
of
the
party
who's
involved.
but
however
that
gets
decided,
that's
premature
now
because
we
are
not
claiming
that
it's
a
necessary
part
of
our
intervention
that
we
have
a
right
to
block
a
compromise.
maybe
we
will
and
maybe
we
won't.
that
law
is
yet
to
be
settled.
it
is
confused
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
period
we're
before
the
board
but
the
board
asserts
a
right
to
compromise
when
we're
before
the
board,
when
we're
a
party.
and
i
don't
see
if
they're
asserting
the
right
to
compromise
when
we're
a
party
before
the
board.
they
haven't
got
the
same
right
to
ascertain
--
that
they
can
compromise
when
we're
a
party
before
the
board.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that.
i
think
they
ought
to
hear
us.
i
think
they
ought
to
hear
us
on
the
compromise
but
i
think
they
do
need
certain
rights
of
compromise
and
just
recently
in
the
kohler
contempt
case,
i
have
personally
told
the
court
and
the
master
that
we
did
not
object
to
the
board
going
ahead
and
discussing
that
matter
without
our
presence.
i
think
that
the
right
of
compromise
is
very
important
to
the
board.
they
have
asserted
it
in
these
cases
and
they
asserted
now.
but
our
intervention
doesn't,
in
my
judgment,
block
that
and
certainly
that
question
isn't
here
yet
and
you'll
have
that
question
conceivably
some
time.
the
board
also
besides
the
argument
on
blocking
settlement,
they
argue
about
the
number
of
cases
involved.
i
can't
see
how
this
determines
it.
if
we
don't
have
the
right
to
block
settlement
when
we
--
we're
almost
going
to
be
helpful
to
them
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
hurtful.
they're
talking
about
certiorari.
well,
i
can't
believe
this
court
is
going
to
grant
many
certs
that
the
intervener
asked
for,
that
the
board
doesn't
want
you
to
grant.
you
can
always
say
“no”
in
this
kind
of
situation.
then
the
board
relies
on
the
amalgamated
case
and
that
case
really
supports
our
position.
if
you
remember
the
amalgamated
case,
aligned
with
utility
workers
case
in
309,
this
court
held
that
the
union
couldn't
file
of
contempt
proceeding.
of
course,
the
union
can't
file
contempt
proceedings.
that's
an
enforcement
part.
but
in
that
very
case,
the
union
had
been
allowed
to
intervene.
if
you
look
at
305
u.s.,
the
consolidated
case
which
was
the
first
of
the
two
cases,
there
the
employer,
the
consolidated
edison
company
was
charged
with
unfair
labor
practices.
they
fought
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
union
was
permitted
to
intervene
and
louis
boudin
argued
in
this
court
as
an
intervener
in
that
consolidated
edison
case.
then
it
came
back
and
the
union
is
trying
to
go
for
contempt
and
this
court
held
it
couldn't
but
right
in
the
opinion
in
amalgamated
in
309,
it
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
union
have
been
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
court
below
and
had
been
allowed
to
argue
in
this
court.
in
other
words,
it
makes
the
same
distinction
that
i'm
really
making
to
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
do
have
a
right
to
intervene
but
we
do
not
have
the
right
to
go
in
for
contempt.
we
do
not
have
the
right
of
blocking
settlement
but
we
do
have
this
court
and
a
matter
of
fact
in
eagle-pitcher
where
we
were
the
--
where
the
union
was
the
petitioner
to
this
court,
had
had
intervened
in
the
court
below
and
was
the
petitioner,
this
court
made
the
identical
reference
to
consolidated
and
amalgamated
that
i
am
making
when
it
said,
“we
think
that
in
the
circumstances
as
close,
the
union
though
they
could
not
have
instituted
enforcement
proceedings,
citing
amalgamated,
had
standing
to
seek
review
having
intervened
below
probably
of
the
order
denying
the
board's
petition
cited
consolidated.
now,
--
so
that
the
board's
reliance
on
amalgamated
actually
is
misplaced
because
they
were
allowed
to
intervene.
we
did
intervene
and
we
did
participate.
we
were
not
allowed
to
file
contempt
and
we
make
no
claim
of
that
here.
finally
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir,
i
think
he
becomes
party.
but
he
was
a
party
in
consolidated
edison
in
305.
he
was
a
full
party.
you
heard
him.
this
court
heard
a
spokesman
for
the
union
in
305
in
consolidated
edison.
then
it
came
back
in
309
in
amalgamated
utility
workers
case
and
you
wouldn't
let
the
same
party
you
heard
file
contempt
proceedings.
he
was
--
but
it's
clear
that
he
was
a
party
but
there
are
certain
limitations
on
this
party.
he
couldn't
file
contempt
proceedings.
that
was
the
only
limitation
you've
ever
held
today
on
this.
but
here,
with
this
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
block
a
settlement.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
you
took
a
lot
of
way
in
amalgamated
when
you
wouldn't
let
him
go
for
contempt.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
say
because
you
wouldn't
let
the
union
go
for
contempt
that
he
wasn't
a
party
after
this
court
heard
him
here
as
a
party
in
the
beginning
of
this
identical
proceedings.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me,
he
was
a
party
but
without
contempt
rights.
that's
--
he
was
a
somewhat
different
party
and
we
don't
deny
that
this
has
to
be
somewhat
adjusted
to
the
public
interest
of
the
labor
board.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
agreed
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
not
to
participate
in
those
in
the
hope
that
the
settlement
could
be
reached,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we're
in
limbo
in
that
particular
case
because
we
have
a
motion
for
intervention
pending
which
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
excuse
me.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
am
saying
that
just
as
this
court
decided
that
though
the
amalgamated
public
utility
workers
could
participate
in
this
court
as
a
party,
which
it
did
in
305,
it
also
held
in
309
that
it
couldn't
bring
contempt
proceedings.
it
obviously
limited
party
rights.
and
i'm
saying
that
we
have
a
right
to
intervene
the
question
of
what
our
party
rights
will
be
is
premature
at
this
time.
you
have
already
demonstrated
by
305
and
309
that
you
do
recognize
unions
as
a
party
in
these
circumstances
but
you
don't
give
them
all
the
rights
of
an
ordinary
party
because
you
took
away
the
contempt
right
and
we
do
not
challenge
that.
just
finally,
the
board
in
its
appendix
points
out
that
every
other
agency,
every
agency
you
can
get
in
private
parties
like
this
do
get
in
except
the
federal
trade
commission.
well,
i
say
we're
not
like
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
federal
trade
commission
starts
on
its
own.
the
board
couldn't
have
started
the
fafnir
case
without
us.
our
charge
is
a
condition
precedent
of
the
beginning
of
the
fafnir
case.
in
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
informant,
if
there
is
one,
there
doesn't
have
to
be,
is
not
a
party.
we're
in
automatic
party
to
the
thing,
we're
part
of
it.
and
the
fundamental
purposes
of
these
laws
are
different.
as
the
klesner
case
280
u.s.,
which
the
board
relies
upon,
proves
the
contrary.
there
they
said
that
the
board,
that
the
ftc
couldn't
even
start
a
case
on
the
basis
of
some
private
wrong.
every
labor
board
case
gets
started
that
way,
a
charge
or
maybe
some
extreme
one
but
every
case
i've
ever
heard
of,
either
labor
people
is
claiming
the
management
did
something
wrong
and
that
starts
it,
the
management's
claim
and
that
the
labor
people
did
something
wrong
or
some
individuals
are
claiming
that
both
of
them
did
something
wrong.
but
the
whole
proceeding
here
as
i
pointed
out
from
the
name
of
this
law
is
a
kind
of
an
umpiring
operation.
we
have
to
concede
some
rights
as
the
contempt,
but
obviously
i
don't
think
i'd
have
to
go
into
the
very
clear
problem.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
must
have
--
had
that
happen
sometimes
when
we've
had
intervention
without
opinion
but
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
critics
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
could
explain
it
although
as
i
said,
when
intervention
has
been
permitted.
there
has
been
no
opinion.
so
i
can't
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
speak
as
to
the
right
of
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
could
involve
discretion,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
--
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
very
likely
what
happened
there,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
hobbs
law
passed
in
1950
where
a
number
of
statutes
were
made
like,
where
the
district
court
review
changed
the
court
of
appeals
review.
i'd
like
just
to
find
that,
if
i
may,
and
call
your
attention
to
it
in
our
brief.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
37
of
the
blue
brief
for
petitioners,
that's
in
number
18.
your
honor
will
look
at
page
37
in
number
18.
we
referred
there
to
5
u.s.c.
1038
which
shows
that
when
congress
changed
the
law
for
a
number
of
other
agencies,
it
provided
for
intervention
and
it
referred
in
there
to
saying
the
pattern
established
for
reviews
of
orders
of
the
federal
trade
commission
and
followed
by
the
law,
since
then,
in
relation
to
many
other
agencies
including
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
bituminous
coal
commission,
and
the
national
labor
relations
board,
in
other
words
it
made
an
assumption
that
this
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
in
the
report,
your
honor.
that's
on
page
38,
the
first
sentence
in
the
report,
and
then
down
below
is
the
actual
statute
which
does
permit
interventions.
so
actually
the
only
place
where
you
don't
get
intervention
at
the
moment
and
i
don't
know
that
it's
been
tried
but
i
don't
think
it
would
succeed
as
a
federal
trade
commission,
i
say
that's
totally
different
because
you
don't
have
the
private
rights
and
you
don't
have
them
as
an
umpire
between
management
and
labor,
the
way
we
are.
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
any
suggestion
that
we
can
do
this
job
as
amicus
curiae
is
obviously
unsound.
you
don't
get
in
on
designating
the
record.
you
don't
determine
the
issues.
you
don't
get
oral
argument.
you
can't
petition
for
a
cert.
this
is
a
wrong
use
of
amicus
curiae.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
defendant?
the
charged
party?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
before
the
labor
board?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
yes,
your
honor.
before
the
labor
board,
the
charging
party
doesn't
have
to
intervene.
under
their
rules,
it's
102.8
of
the
labor
board
rules,
the
charging
party
is
automatically
a
party
before
the
board.
he
doesn't
even
have
to
go
and
say
i
want
to
come
in.
he
is
in.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
statute
permits
the
board
to
do
this
but
doesn't
direct
it,
yes
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
yes,
he'd
be
a
party
although
--
if
the
board
hadn't
made
the
charging
party
a
party,
the
word
“party”
would
be
hard
but
the
statute
contemplated
that
it
would
be
aggrieved
at
that
time
in
which
they
denied
the
relief
he
sought,
but
they
would
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
right.
just
like
decided,
no
complaint
issues.
the
general
counsel
has
full
authority
over
the
complaint.
that's
absolutely
right.
but
he
can't
issue
the
complaint
without
a
charge
and
once
the
charge
complaint
is
issued,
we
are
automatically
a
party
and
i
think
if
the
board
needs
us,
the
court
of
appeals
generally
wouldn't
need
us
too.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'd
say
like
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
precisely
the
contrary
if
your
honor
please.
they
don't
need
to
charge.
they
don't
have
any
regulation
about
if
a
man
does
make
a
charge,
he
can
be
the
party
and
in
fact
justice
brandeis'
opinion
in
280
indicates
that
he
doesn't
even
--
that
they
should
even
start
a
proceeding
because
of
a
private
interest.
that's
exactly
the
difference
in
statutes,
the
proceeding
is
started
for
the
labor
board
because
of
the
private
interest
but
it
cannot
be
started
in
front
of
the
federal
trade
commission
under
the
cluster
case
because
of
the
private
interest.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
the
sense
your
honor,
yes.
that
the
congress
setup
especially
in
the
labor
management
relations
act
in
1947,
private
rights
on
both
sides
referring
to
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
set
the
board
up
as
the
umpire
of
those
private
rights,
the
umpire
in
the
public
interest
but
when
there
were
these
interests,
it
can
be
inferred
from
them
that
they
expected
that
cong
--
that
we
would,
to
both
sides,
it's
not
that
--
i
keep
saying
we.
i'm
speaking
badly
because
the
management
has
the
identical
problem
of
intervention.
we
have
this
all
the
time
where
management
as
the
winning
party
has
sought
to
intervene.
but
both
sides
that
because
of
the
private
rights
that
congress
setup,
it
seems
to
us,
they
had
intended
this.
but
at
best,
the
silence
of
congress
is
up
to
this
court
to
interpret
and
under
its
supervisory
authority
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
to
tell
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
section
10
(l),
if
your
honor
please,
is
the
closest
thing
to
it
in
the
statute.
section
10
(l),
if
your
honor
will
recall,
the
taft-hartley,
they
require
the
board
to
go
for
an
injunction
in
certain
instances
and
the
charging
party
there
is
made
an
automatic
party
in
the
district
court
in
those
circumstances.
it
just
would
be
congressional
idiosyncrasy,
it
is
the
keiffer
case
language
to
assume
that
they
--
that
they
were
assuming
that
they'd
be
kept
out
of
here.
section
10
(l)
is
an
identical
situation
that
goes
into
the
district
court
where
the
charging
party
is
made
an
automatic
party.
i
was
saying
that
there
is
no
--
this
is
not
the
right
use
of
amicus
curiae
with
direct
--
the
amicus
curiae
you
think
in
terms
of
an
organization
or
someone
with
a
similar
interest.
we're
directly
interested
party
and
you
cannot
so
easily
resolve
the
problem
as
by
saying,
“oh
let
them
be
an
amicus
curiae
and
file
a
brief.”
it
will
not
solve
the
problem
of
getting
before
this
court
in
an
administratively
sound
way,
all
of
the
parties
if
anything
is
to
come
here.
so
in
conclusion,
if
your
honors
please,
the
game
opens
with
the
charge
by
the
management
or
union,
when
the
labor
board
moves,
the
charging
management
or
labor
is
a
party.
it
files
exceptions
if
it
doesn't
agree
with
the
trial
examiner.
it
argues
before
the
board
and
all
of
a
sudden,
it
gets
out
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
we
suggest
that
the
board
concedes
the
power
to
do
this.
it
concedes
our
very,
very
direct
interest
and
as
the
distinguished
panel
that
i
mentioned
when
i
started
this
argument
said,
“any
party
to
nlrb
proceedings
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
appellate
proceedings.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
did
not
ask
the
general
counsel
to
prosecute
this
case
for
us.
we
filed
a
charge
when
the
board
rules
made
us
a
party
if
the
charge
resulted
in
a
complaint.
mr.
--
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
that
we
are
not
a
party
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word,
and
i
challenge
that
that
we
are
not
a
party
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word
before
the
board.
the
ruling,
the
board
rules
makes
us
a
party,
we
call
witnesses,
we
issue
subpoenas
for
witnesses,
we
cross-examine,
we
affect
the
record,
we
go
to
the
board
itself,
how
anybody
can
say
we're
not
a
full
party
before
the
board?
the
one
thing
we
may
not
have
is
the
right
to
block
a
settlement,
we
don't
know
about
that
yet.
the
court
of
appeals
is
split
and
this
board
and
this
court
has
enacted.
but
they
suggest
that
we're
not
a
party
when
we
have
the
rights
to
do
all
the
things
the
parties
do
before
the
board.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
it's
split.
there's
this
division
of
a
party
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
not
at
the
board,
they
think
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
right,
but
the
marine
engineers'
case
in
the
third
circuit
appears
to
indicate
it's
not
valid
now,
but
i'm
not
going
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
all
these
settlement
cases
are
at
the
board
level.
there's
no
settlement
case
involved
that's
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
but
to
say
we're
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
certain.
i
would
probably
get
to
argue
for
this
but
i
want
to
say
this,
that
going
to
take
the
amalgamated
case
where
the
solicitor
general
had
suggested
that
it's
been
criticized
by
the
people.
--
i
am
not
challenging
the
amalgamated
case.
i'm
accepting
the
content
part
of
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
language
of
the
case,
which
is
more
damaging
to
us
than
the
result,
that
case
was
in
‘40.
in
1947,
congress
really
changed
the
basic
structure
when
it
passed
taft-hartley.
it
changed
it
from
the
board's
drive
for
unions
to
a
management
relations
operation.
so
there's
a
serious
question
whether
the
language
of
chief
justice
--
the
result
is
settled
as
far
as
i'm
--
there's
a
serious
question
whether
all
the
language
would
be
used
today
in
view
of
the
taft-hartley
labor
management
relations
a
year
--
seven
years
later.
but
the
one
point
i
want
to
get
over
is
before
the
board,
we're
no
second
class
citizen.
we
are
a
first
class
citizen
in
every
area
including
this
one,
in
calling
witness
and
cross-examining
and
appealing
to
the
board,
we
are
a
first-class
citizen
as
a
full
party.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
we
call
our
own
witnesses,
we
cross-examine
their
witnesses.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
we
cross-examine
both
the
board
witnesses
and
the
respondent's
witnesses.
we're
in
this
up
to
the
hill,
not
you
say
that
we'd
let
the
general
counsel
to
put
on
his
witnesses
first,
i
suppose
that's
perfectly
true
that
that
would
happen
ordinarily,
but
we
certainly
have
full
status
there
--
or
they're
not
--
we're
carrying
as
much
as
of
the
ball,
we
can
now,
it's
true,
very
often
even
small
unions
don't
go
into
those
cases
and
that
the
funds
have
--
it's
right.
their
work
is
done
at
the
expense
of
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
have
a
full
right
to
get
subpoenas
on
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
see
that
i
would
use
the
word
'ran
the
show'.
i
think
he
may
carry
the
major
burden
because
the
union's
--
if
we
made
the
charges
nice,
they
have
at
government
expense,
they
have
the
witnesses.
but
if
then,
when
we
call
our
own
witnesses
and
we
cross-examine,
and
we
go
to
the
board
and
we
use
different
arguments,
and
that
point
about
what
could
they
have
in
addition
to
what
the
board
has?
we
have
arguments
in
addition.
i
want
to
tell
you
about
a
case
that
had
just
came
down
in
the
seventh
circuit,
in
allis-chalmers
which
is
a
companion
case
to
scofield.
there
we
had
a
question
of
whether
it
was
proper
to
find
workers'
members
for
going
through
picket
lines,
to
find
this
case
through
going
through
the
picket
lines,
a
very
tough
question.
we
made
a
totally
different
argument
from
the
board
in
front
of
the
court
of
appeals
where
we
had
been
allowed
to
intervene
by
the
consent
of
all
parties.
and
the
court
took
our
argument.
in
other
words,
why
is
it
strange
if
we
should
have
different
arguments
than
the
board?
why
is
it
strange
when
the
board
wants
us
as
a
party
because
we
know
something
about
labor
law,
they
should
suddenly
say,
“when
you
get
in
front
of
the
court
of
appeals
we
suddenly
have
got
nothing
to
offer.”
we
have
something
to
offer
and
as
far
--
but
what
i
want
to
make
clear
is
on
the
certiorari
point,
mr.
justice
white.
i
did
not
indicate
that
we
had
no
rights
in
that
respect.
thus,
a
very
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference
and
i
want
to
come
to
the
difference.
we
obviously
don't
have
a
contempt
right.
that's
a
public
interest
right.
it's
quite
likely
we
don't
have
a
settlement,
to
block
a
settlement
right.
but
to
get
the
legal
problem
settled,
to
get
it
before
this
court,
i
would
say
we
would
have
that
right
but
i
would
say
that
most
cases,
this
court's
going
to
deny
a
cert
where
a
union
seeks
to
bring
an
issue
here,
and
the
board
doesn't
want
it.
now
there
are
some
cases
where
they
grant
a
cert.eagle-picher
is
a
case
where
you
granted
cert
where
we
union
asked
for
it.
there's
also
steel
worker's
case
in
376
u.s.
where
the
board
didn't
seek
review,
steelworkers
did,
it
was
granted
and
reversed
and
so
that
there
are
cases
where
you
would.
but
ordinarily
i
would
assume
because
i
really
think,
i
believe
more
in
the
public
interest
doctrine,
than
apparently
jaffe
and
davis
do
in
the
things
to
which
thurgood
marshall
referred.
it
seems
to
me
he
was
quite
--
i
accept
that.
but
it
does
seem
to
me,
we
would
have
a
right
to
come
here
but
not
we
would
assume
that
the
court
would
want
the
government's
views
as
the
major
matter.
now
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
i
have
no
question
if
they
have
the
power
to
approve
it,
despite
our
opposition.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
they
have
always
taken
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
all
settlements
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now
the
solicitor
general
indicated
that
the
judge,
they
generally
approve
them.
but
they've
always
--
they've
been
taken
there.
they
rather
indicate
it's
rather
routine
when
he
said
on
the
bench
but
they
always
do
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
the
proceeding
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
procedure
is
here
but
it
may
be
that
if
we
try
to
dismiss
this
case,
we'd
have
to
ask
the
court's
permission,
and
i
think
it's
the
same
way.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
consent
decree
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
it's
a
consent
decree
entered
by
the
court.
may
i
just
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
just
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
call
your
attention
to
number
18
blue,
it's
at
page
40
of
our
brief,
footnote
32
deals
with
section
10
(l)
which
was
put
in
to
the
law
in
47
which
i
believe
is
a
very
clear
analogy
in
the
statute
to
where
private
intervention
is
required
even
though
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
i
think
you
had
a
right
to
it,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
--
all
settlements
are
submitted
to
the
courts.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
once
you're
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
far
as
i
know
when
you
dismiss
any
case,
the
court
has
a
right,
it's
a
consent.
i
think
the
closest
words
that
were
--
the
words
used
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
a
consent
decree,
but
the
courts
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
that
may
be
the
theoretical.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
you
submit
the
terms
to
the
court
orderly.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
seems
to
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
to
the
former
circuit
court
judges
here,
and
bring
back
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
on
what's
going
on?
oh,
i'm
sorry
there
is
a
complete
agreement
between
the
forum
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
quite
likely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
conclusion,
i
like
just
to
take
up
the
solicitor
general
on
his
definition
of
the
difference
between
the
two
cases.
what
we're
really
here
before
us,
i
say
they're
the
same,
he
says
they're
different.
in
an
answer
to
a
question,
he
said
the
difference
is
that
the
respondent
loses
something,
so
he's
got
a
right
to
be
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
charging
party
is
different.
now,
i
challenge
that
and
i
ask
you
to
look
once
more
in
fafnir.
if
we
have
lost
fafnir
and
we
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
respondent
would
have
lost
and
had
a
right
to
intervene
the
solicitor
general,
the
government
says,
would
have
had
the
right
to
intervene
because
they
have
lost
the
fact
that
time
study
people
would
come
in
to
the
plant.
isn't
here
anachronism
to
say
they
couldn't
go
--
the
company
can
go
in
there
because
time
study
people
would
come
into
their
plant,
but
we
can't
intervene
because
we
want
time
study
people
in
their
plant?
in
other
words,
i'm
saying
that
the
difference
between
scofield
and
fafnir,
illustrated
by
fafnir
if
it
were
had
gone
the
other
way,
makes
clear
that
the
cases
are
identical.
