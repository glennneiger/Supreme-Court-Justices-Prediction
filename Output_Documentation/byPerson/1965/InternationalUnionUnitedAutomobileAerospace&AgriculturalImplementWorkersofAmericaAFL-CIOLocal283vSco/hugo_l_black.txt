justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
drawing
a
support
from
either
from
the
labor
act
of
many
other
statutes
passed
by
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
the
statute
or
in
the
reports?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
argue
at
all
that
we
can
find
and
draw
inferences
from
statute
as
a
whole,
or
any
part
of
it
that
congress
did
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
finally
get
away
from
that
word
supervisory.
that's
a
little
too
broad
for
me
in
many
aspects.
i
want
to
find
some
statute
if
i
can.
i
think
that's
been
used
too
loosely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
case
you're
reading
from?
you
had
just
submitted
the
early
dissent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
(inaudible)
--
you
think
the
third
party
could
go
to
the
court
and
say,
“they're
settling
my
case,
they've
given
away
my
claim,
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
permit
this
case
to
be
dismissed,“
if
he
is
a
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you
argue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
down
the
basic
issue
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
or
not
it
is
just
the
public's
interest.
if
he
has
filed
a
charge
and
it
affects
his
interest,
and
he's
permitted
to
file
the
charge
and
could
have
appealed
from
a
refusal,
the
question
is
whether
it
is
only
the
public's
definition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
we
--
whether
we
can
find
something
in
the
statute
that
says
that,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
part
of
the
statute
that
says
that
he
has
a
right
to
have
--
be
heard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
referred
to
the
(inaudible)
case
which
i
have
now
just
read.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
gain
the
support
for
your
side
--
your
arguments
from
that
or
the
other
side,
which
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
the
other
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
very
much
like
the
court
went
a
long
way
there,
isn't
it,
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
allow
the
union
to
intervene
because
it
had
an
interest,
although
it
had
no
original
right
to
bring
the
case
up.
