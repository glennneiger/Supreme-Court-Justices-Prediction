mr.
rauh
--
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
what
about
the
procedural
problem
here,
it
worries
me
somewhat.
you
got
an
order
denying
intervention
from
a
single
judge
and
then
it
was
considered
by
a
division
and
the
division
refused
reconsideration
of
the
order.
and
then
it
comes
here
on
certiorari?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
your
--
your
i
suppose
confident
of
course,
it's
your
position
that
that's
a
correct
way
to
review
this.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rauh.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rauh,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me,
tentatively
of
course
that
perhaps
the
issue
here
is
the
control
of
the
litigation,
and
i
suppose
that
the
point
of
which
i'd
very
much
like
to
here
you
comment
is
this.
the
structure
of
the
act
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
labor
board
does
have
control
as
to
whether
the
complaint
will
be
filed
the
proceeding
instituted,
and
then
i
suppose
with
--
more
or
less
logic
perhaps
less
rather
than
more,
more
rather
than
less,
they
say
that
they
don't
have
control
of
the
litigation
that
that's
not
the
--
and
that
the
issue
is
now
whether
the
courts
ought
to
be
able
to
hear
your
eloquence
and
persuasive
voice
but
who
control
this
litigation
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
except
when
you're
before
the
board
also
propose
a
--
proposes
a
compromise
and
decides
whether
they'll
be
accepted.
and
i
suppose
the
situation
is
at
least
slightly
different
on
it
before
the
board.
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
rauh,
you
do
not
take
the
position
and
that
the
board
ought
not
to
have
the
right
to
compromise.
i
thought
that
perhaps
your
position
would
be
that
since
you
would
be
the
real
party
in
interest
or
a
real
party
in
interest,
the
board
ought
not
to
have
the
right
to
compromise
in
its
--
just
on
its
motion
and
without
anticipation
by
you.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
raugh
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
referred
to
a
situation
i
think
kohler
in
which
you
said
you
encouraged
the
union
and
the
board
or
the
employer
and
the
board
to
have
a
private
discussion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
about
settlement.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
any
case
where
you
are
a
party
before
an
appellate
court,
i
should
think
that
the
board
and
the
employer
would
have
to
have
you
present
and
compromise
a
settlement
discussions
and
then
it'd
be
up
to
you
to
waive
that
or
not
waive
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
that
case.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
the
principle
of
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
it's
not
only
ours,
but
a
majority
permit
respondent,
a
majority
have
not
permitted
on
the
charging
party
to
get
in
but
a
number
have
--
there
are
a
great
many
--
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
in
our
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
we
have
some
in
our
--
we
have
some
cases
mentioned
in
our
petition
for
cert
before
this
court.
i
can't
immediately
call
to
name
those
that
have.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
circuits
have
done
differently
at
different
times.
it's
been
a
hard
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
in
any
rule.
this
circuit
has
allowed
the
charging
party
in
one
case
it's
kept
the
respondent
out
in
another,
in
the
district
court.
one
right
now,
it's
pending
--
a
respondent
was
kept
out
of
it
but
in
an
earlier
one,
a
charging
party
was
left,
in
other
words,
there
are
cases
both
ways,
but
i
do
have
to
agree
with
judge
friendly
that
they
have
largely
on
discussion
been
kept
out
of
the
charging
party.
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rauh,
excuse
me,
i
think
the
federal
trade
commission
preceding
a
party
who
is
a
party
to
the
administrative
proceeding
has
--
is
generally
allowed
to
intervene,
perhaps
as
a
right
to
intervene,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no.
anybody
who
is
allowed
to
intervene
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
although
i
don't
think
they're
allowing
the
intervention
very
often.
are
you
telling
me
that
--
you're
telling
us
that
the
charging
party
has
made
a
party
before
the
board?
justice
abe
fortas
nlrb,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
there
is
a
comparable
situation
on
the
federal
trade
commission
--
justice
abe
fortas
referring
to
this.
justice
abe
fortas
general,
i
don't
understand
why
you're
basing
your
concern
about
that
case.
currently,
the
court
allowed
the
union
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
dispute
the
proposition
that
once
the
union
has
intervened,
that
has
all
the
rights
of
the
party
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
thought
you're
position
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
--
the
discretionary
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
allow
or
disallow
intervention
in
these
situations
should
be
recognized.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
may
i
ask
you
a
further
question
here.
let's
suppose
that
the
board
and
the
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
petitioner
in
the
court
of
appeals
agree
on
a
settlement
while
the
case
is
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
does
that
require
a
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
it's
a
settlement
on
the
case,
does
it
require
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then,
the
panel
of
the
court
has
agreed
and
asked
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
sent
an
order.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
don't
understand.
perhaps
you'll
help
me
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
take
your
the
time
is
what
is
the
objection
of
the
united
states
to
having
the
union
or
the
company
participate
at
that
point,
let
us
say,
suppose
the
intervener
did
object
to
the
settlement
arrived
at
by
the
board
and
the
other
party,
couldn't
the
court
enter
an
order
overriding
that
the
objection
to
the
settlement?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
what
i'm
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
the
position
of
the
united
states
here
and
the
board
is
really
an
objection
to
the
right,
the
asserted
right
of
the
labor
union
and
mr.
rauh's
case
to
be
heard
number
one.
and
number
2,
the
right
or
the
asserted
right
of
the
labor
union
in
his
case
to
petition
for
a
certiorari
in
this
court,
is
that
your
objection?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
general,
i
want
to
make
my
question
very
clear.
justice
abe
fortas
no.
and
i'm
sure
it's
my
fault.
but
my
specific
question
is
whether
the
board
and
united
states
are
here
taking
that
position
that
at
an
intervention
is
allowed
to
mr.
rauh's
union,
then
that
union
will
have
the
power
to
block
the
settlement
if
one
jas
agreed
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
that
really
the
fact
or
is
it
the
fact
that
all
the
union
would
have
in
mr.
rauh's
case,
would
be
the
right
to
be
heard,
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
state
its
objections
if
they
have
any
to
the
settlement,
and
then
perhaps
the
right
to
petition
in
this
court's
certiorari.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rauh,
excuse
me,
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say,
just
now
that
where
the
labor
board
and
the
other
party,
let
me
say,
agree
on
a
settlement
compromise
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
power
to
approve
that
settlement
despite
the
opposition
in
your
case,
of
your
union.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
rauh,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
that
viewed
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rauh,
is
that
due
to
the
broad
powers
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
to
say
that
on
a
labor
board
case,
the
court
of
appeals
not
only
has
a
power
to
say
yes
or
no,
but
it
has
the
power
to
modify
or
to
set
aside
bower
and
pride.
justice
abe
fortas
and
perhaps
it's
because
in
that
pervasive
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
appeals
that
these
matters
are
presented
in
factual
detail.
