justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rauh
then,
then
i
gather,
you
insist
if
it's
due
process
problem,
that
you're
entitled
to
right.
it's
not
a
matter
or
any
discretion
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
supervisory
or
is
it
due
process?
well,
if
its
due
process,
we
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
no,
i
would
suppose
if
it
was
a
supervisory,
there
might
be
a
consideration
of
discretion.
so
--
it
would
not
be
so
if
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
due
process.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
not
if
he
lose,
the
charging
party
loses,
then
the
statute
makes
a
party
aggrieved
for
the
purpose
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
petitioning
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
only
if
the
complaint
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
complaint
is
in
his
name?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
he
controls
the
litigation
before
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
he
--
he'd
been
--
he
filed
a
charge
to
the
general
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
general
counsel
issued
the
complaint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
goes
to
litigation
before
the
board
and
the
board
dismisses
the
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
he
have
a
standing
or
may
he
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
may.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
then
makes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
to
that
extent,
he's
a
party,
he
may
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
go
much
for
those
labels.
the
fact
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
has
a
statutory
right,
does
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
petition
and
there
he
is
the
one
who
initiates
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
before
you
get
to
this
may
i
just
ask,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
in
circumstances
of
this
kind,
we
ought
to
say
that
he
should
never
be
allowed
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
merely
that
he
has
no
right
to
get
into
the
court
of
appeals
but
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
discretion
to
let
him
in
if
they
want
to
which
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
that
we
should
say
that
he
neither
has
the
right
nor
is
there
any
discretion
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
no
matter
what
the
circumstance
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
haven't
seen
these
cases
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
were
five
cited
here
in
the
petition
in
--
i
guess
this
is
18,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
illuminating
opinions
of
court
rules
in
most
circuits
that
denied
intervention
to
the
charging
party,
but
intervention
has
occasionally
been
allowed,
and
then
the
citations,
two
from
the
district
of
columbia,
and
two
from
the
seventh
circuit,
one
from
the
eighth
circuit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
haven't
read
those
cases.
i
don't
know
whether
those
are
true.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
are
you
urging
on
us
if
i
may
come
back
to
it,
that
we
should
say
that
the
charging
party
in
this
circumstance
should
never
be
allowed
in
notwithstanding
the
court
of
appeals
in
particular
situation,
it
may
feel
that
discretion
should
be
exercised.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
a
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
board
and
the
respondents
decide
to
settle.and
the
union
has
been
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now
what
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
settlement.
the
union
has
an
objection
to
the
settlement,
the
union
doesn't
present
into
the
court
of
appeals
it
doesn't,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seemed
to
me,
if
the
case
was
settled,
then
the
consequences,
i
suppose,
is
the
dismissal
of
the
enforcement
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
what
is
it
that
the
union
can
do
if
it's
there,
it
can
have
any
effect
on
either
the
settlement,
or
on
the
consequent
dismissal
of
the
enforcement
proceedings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
been
any
effort
to
get
congress
to
amend
the
act
along
the
lines
of
section
8
of
the
hobbs
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
even
after
that
blue
ribbon
panel
said
this
ought
to
be
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rauh,
i
think
you
know
about
that
yet.
you
know
about
that
yet,
so
far
as
we
--
a
settlement
in
the
board
or
the
board
case
within
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
say
at
the
board
level,
do
you
know
that
you're
--
that
you
can't
do
anything
about
bargains.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
at
the
board
level?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
suppose
i
could
anticipate
what
your
position
would
be
if
we
said
you
had
the
right
to
intervene?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there's
a
settlement,
what
involves
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
approval
of
the
settlement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
proceeding
is
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
dismissed
without
prior
approval
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
absolutely.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rauh
i
must
say,
if
you
suggest
that
that's
what
happens
here,
i've
never
known
that
to
happen
here,
when
the
parties
settle
and
they
ask
us
to
dismiss
under
the
rule
60,
i've
never
looked
at
the
terms
of
settlement,
to
decide
whether
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
happens
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
--
is
there
any
reason
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
there
any
rule
or
statute
or
anything
else
to
the
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
--
this
suggest
that
there
has
to
be
approval
of
the
terms
of
the
settlement
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
new
to
me.
