did
anybody
oppose
intervention
on
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
not
here,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
not
of
course
--
they
were
not
parties
in
the
court
of
appeals
really?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
they
are
the
appellant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
petitioner
that
is.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
the
intervener
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
explanation
as
to
why
they're
not
here
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
case
isn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
really
being
litigated
here?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rauh,
this
legislation
has
been
on
the
books
a
good
many
years
now
and
what
did
the
courts
done
in
this
first
case
which
you
say
is
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
there's
any
question
at
all
about
the
--
since
this
isn't
litigated,
there's
no
need
to
raise
a
question,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
fortas'
suggestion
raises
a
jurisdictional
question
which
is
always
open
of
course,
and
is
there
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
question
about
the
time
within
which
you
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration
by
a
full
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
generally,
an
intervener,
a
successful
intervener
becomes
a
party
and
you're
not
telling
us
that
it
may
well
be
in
this
situation
he
does
not
become
a
party.
so
this
is
something
less
than
intervention
as
it
generally
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
and
then
you
now
suggested
that
it
is
possible
and
he
might
not
be
able
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
block
a
settlement,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
would
certainly
take
a
great
deal
of
what
we
generally
consider
the
power
of
a
party
away
from
it.
justice
potter
stewart
has
any
--
has
any
court
of
appeals
taken
a
position
that
it's
not
--
that
there
is
no
right
to
intervene
but
that
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
may
allow
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
also
explain
the
fact
that
the
courts
have
gone
both
ways.
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
courts
have
gone
both
ways
on
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact,
the
statutes
says
that
an
aggrieved
person
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
the
statute
doesn't
help
up
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
very
much
to
the
issue.
and
he
had
that
issue
correctly
say
because
of
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
statute
which
appears
on
h

of
the
petitioners'
brief

justice
potter
stewart
i
know
--
of
course
there's
no
question
as
i
--
as
i
understand
it.
you
don't
pretend
to
question
the
--
proposition
that
the
charging.
if
the
general
counsel
does
not
issue
a
complaint,
that's
the
end
of
this.
justice

there
are
no
appeal
at
all.
justice

stewart
--
the
charging
party

that's
the
end
of
the
line.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
much
--
and
i'm
asking
this
for
information,
mr.
rauh,
i
just
need
to
know,
how
much
actually
control
of
the
proceedings
before
the
board,
does
the
general
counsel
have
or
is
designated?
and
how
much
does
the
charging
party
have
if
--
after
the
complaint
has
been
issued.
justice
potter
stewart
thiers
--
who's
theirs?
you
mean
the
other
charging
party
(voice

justice
potter

and
it's
done
(voice

it's
been
my
impression
and
as
i
have
said
this
is
informational,
this
isn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
impressions
that
the
general
counsel
ran
a
show
in
there,
insofar
as
the
proceedings

justice

consent
decree?
justice
potter

that's
what
entered

to

court
of
appeals,
and
here

and
to
like

i
should

any,
