justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rauh,
what's
been
your
experience
in
the
courts
of
appeals
so
far
on
this
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
permits
--
what
circuits
--
do
you
know
which
circuits
permits
you
the
successful
charging
party
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps,
we're
worried
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
a
matter
of
board
rule,
not
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
might
not
be
--
he
might
not
be
if
the
board
didn't
make
him
a
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor,
let's
concede
for
the
moment
that
there
are
public
rights
involved,
and
that
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
is
a
matter
of
public
right,
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
therefore
intervention
in
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
be
allowed
by
that
court
to
aid
in
the
consideration
of
whatever
the
public
right
might
be,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
private
right
to
permit
intervention
in
a
manner
--
i
suppose
there
is
a
public
right
involved
when
a
charging
party,
a
charged
party
is
successful,
and
he's
permitted
to
intervene
there
although
where
i
suppose
we're
dealing
with
the
public
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
may,
but
it's
a
--
but
it
doesn't
become
a
private
right
just
be
in
one
case
and
a
public
right
in
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
want
what
a
--
what
a
successful
respondent
gets.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
true,
that's
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
really
getting
down
to
it
then,
isn't
it?
isn't
it
a
consideration
of
the
--
isn't
a
judgment
of
whether,
whether
the
charging
party
really
would
contribute
much
to
these
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
any
more
than
the
general
counsel
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
suggested
that
just
because
he
became
a
party,
he
don't
have
all
the
rights
of
the
party,
that
might
be
one
of
them
that
didn't
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think,
isn't
it
--
in
18
as
your
position
that
this
ought
to
be
a
matter
of
discretion
rather
than
a
right
about
the
--
about
the
--
you
think
the
successful
respondent
ought
to
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
a
matter
of
right
or
a
matter
of
discretion
similar
to
--
i
take
it
from
your
footnote
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
your
brief,
that
you
think
it's
by
analogy
that
24
(b)
in
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
new
appellate
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
deal
with
intervention?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
say,
just
the
intervention
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
a
discretionary
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
18
then
if
the
court
have
reversed
this
--
the
court
of
appeals,
we
would
do
so
in
terms
of
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
except
you
have
oral
argument,
it
will
make
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
anymore
work
for
the
lawyers,
mr.
solicitor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
solicitor,
i
take
it
that
there
are
cases.
i
know
you
don't
like
to
anticipate
cases,
but
there
are
cases
where
the
question
about
the
unfair
labor
practice
is
identical
with
the
breach
of
contract
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
the
unfair
labor
question
would
be
rather
relevant
and
only
on
the
contract
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
perhaps
dispositive
of
the
union's
claim
or
the
individual's
claim
of
the
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
got
--
is
this
a
breach
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
it's
a
breach
of
contract,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
they
picked
the
forum,
and
they
also
--
they
want
to
stay
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
want
to
stay
in
the
court,
they
want
to
--
they
want
to
get
up
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
participate
there
because
the
disposition
of
the
question
may
dispose
their
contract
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
where
--
what's
the
their
position
going
to
be
if
they
file
301
suit
in
the
district
court
for
breach
of
contract,
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
circuit
has
already
decided
the
unfair
labor
practice
case
and
the
issue
is
identical.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
--
so
that
the
union's
never
had
a
hearing
in
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
asking
for
one
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
--
i
hope
i
didn't
indicate
what
you
indicated
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
my
indication.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
but
do
you
submit
the
terms
of
the
settlement?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
terms
of
the
settlement
that
are
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
even
submit
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
actually
submit
the
terms
to
the
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
to
say
it's
been
settled?
