justice
potter
stewart
in
illinois,
this
is
for
a
matter
of
information,
is
it
always
the
jury
which
makes
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
defendant
is
insane
at
the
time
of
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
prosecution
if
the
question
is
raised
could
--
could
say
yes,
he
is,
and
then
there
would
be
no
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
--
but
if
--
if
the
matter
has
put
an
issue,
that's
for
a
jury
to
determine
is
it
under
the
illinois
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you're
telling
us
is
all
the
--
is
--
is
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
the
state
criminal
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
the
results
are
different
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
insanity
as
well.
if
it's
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
result
is
he
can't
be
tried.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
i
suppose
he
is
committed.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
regained
insanity
then
he
can
be
tried.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
its
insanity
applying
to
what
mr.
justice
fortas
said
(voice
overlap)
the
different
test
of
its
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
conduct
for
which
he's
being
prosecuted,
it's
not
a
crime
if
he
was
insane
so
he
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he's
acquitted
and
i
suppose
also
institutionalized,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
right.
but
he
is
acquitted
of
the
events
because
it's
not
an
offense
if
the
actor
is
insane.
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
incident
the
one
that
resulted
in
his
confinement
to
the
mental
institute?
justice
potter
stewart
oh
after
--
justice
potter
stewart
tried
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
long
did
the
sentence
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
served
in
prison.
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
the
facts
of
this
case
go,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
language
in
the
record
mr.
dermott's
statement
in
the
record,
page
167
which
was
referred
to
by
mr.
michael
that
he
had
got
in
touch
with
many
psychiatrists
or
at
least
made
two
or
three
dozen
telephone
calls
to
psychiatrists
and
then
he
decided
not
to
subpoena
any
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
also
--
he
also
explained
why
he
hadn't
subpoenaed
mr.
and
mrs.
moore
at
the
same
time.
