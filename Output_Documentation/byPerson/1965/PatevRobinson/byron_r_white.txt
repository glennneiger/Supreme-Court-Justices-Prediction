justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
of
not
that
you
stated
but
the
--
but
the
question
of
whether
he
was
denied
the
procedural
due
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
he
wanted
to
call
–
let's
just
assume
that
he
wanted
to
call
some
witnesses
on
an
issue
that
was
critical
to
the
case
and
the
state
refused
to
hear
his
witnesses.
they
were
in
the
court
and
the
judge
says,
i
just
won't
hear
them
at
all
or
let's
assume
he
wanted
to
cross-examine
the
state
witness
and
he
was
barred
from
examining.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
what
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
different
way
as
i
suppose,
but
didn't
they
come
pretty
close
to
deciding
that
there
was
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
they
did
then
this
matter
is
cognizable
on
habeas
corpus?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
the
argument
you
are
making
was
simply
that
a
federal
court
of
habeas
corpus
will
not
review
or
go
through
the
same
routine
again
if
the
only
claim
is
that
this
fellow
was
really
insane
although
the
state
held
he
wasn't.
that's
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
i
am
just
asking
what
your
argument
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
this
court
ever
decided
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
--
to
try
a
man
who
is
competent
to
stand
trial,
i
suppose
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
talking
about
his
competency
to
stand
trial?
if
the
court
held
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
tried
then,
at
the
time
he
is
purported
to
be
tried,
is
not
comparable
to
stand
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
do
you
think
about
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he
--
when
he
can't
understand
the
charge
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
so
that
--
didn't
you
think
that
issue
has
been
constituted
in
federal
habeas
corpus?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
so,
how
about
fay
v.
noia?
you
only
asked
that
illinois
deliberately
bypassed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
attempt
in
your
mind
to
formulate
any
federal
standards
for
--
for
what
it
means
to
be
competent
to
stand
trial
or
--
or
you
just
say
it
that
way
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he
can
understand
the
charges
and
gives
aid
to
his
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
they
say,
we
just
don't
want
to
raise
the
question
of
competency
to
stand
on
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
preclude
consideration
of
the
insanity
defense
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't
be
any
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
who
correctly
ruled
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
correctly
ruled
on
--
?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
the
record
besides
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
always
--
very
frequently
when
the
courts
have
reversed
a
direct
appeal
or
even
in
habeas
corpus
when
a
new
trial
was
ordered,
the
trial
takes
place
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
full
new
trial
but
you're
not
--
i
don't
see
a
full
new
trial
in
this
matter
and
the
limited
trial
insofar
as
the
choice
between
federal
and
state
court
hearing
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
--
do
i
gather
then
that
you
see
no
objection
in
remanding
to
the
state
court
to
rehear
the
question
of
sanity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
it's
part
of
the
brand
new
--
of
the
complete
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you.
let's
assume
we
agree
with
you
that
there
has
been
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights
in
that
there
was
not
a
fair
hearing,
a
fair
enough
hearing
on
the
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
that
there
was
a
denial
of
constitutional
right
but
there
was
no
hearing
at
all
to
speak
of
competency
to
stand
trial.
and
if
those
two
matters
should
be
determined
on
their
merits,
you
say
that
unless
they
have
a
complete
new
trial
that
--
that
determination
on
its
merits
should
take
place
in
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
even
hypothetical
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
wasn't
haines'
testimony
though
relevant
to
competency
to
stand
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
said
that
we
think
dr.
haines
ought
to
be
here,
–
he
ought
to
be
here
and
testify
in
regard
to
competency
to
stand
trial
because
that's
all
he
would
have
testified,
and
that's
what
stipulation
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
dr.
haines'
testimony
in
full.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
that's
just
my
stipulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
to
testify.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
think
that
if
he
were
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
defense
counsel
--
the
defense
counsel
said,
well
in
order
to
save
further
delay,
they
would
stipulate
that
the
defendant
robinson
knows
the
nature
of
the
charge
pending
against
him
and
if
they
cooperate
with
this
counsel
