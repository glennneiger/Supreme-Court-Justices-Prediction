mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief

was
this

warren
mr.

there
--
was
there
anything
peculiar
about
his
arrest
in
this
case
that
he
attempted
to
escape,
flee
from
the
city
or
anything?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
made
any
effort
to
conceal
the
weapon
or
the
clothes
or
anything
that
he
used
the
night
before?
chief

is
your
--

in

require
the
--
the
court
to
offer
the
defendant
and
not
to
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
entitled
the
allocution
before

the
judge
--
if
he
required

an
opportunity
to
say
something
in
his
own
behalf?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
before
that,
the
judge
said
immediately
after
the
completion
of
his
counsel's
argument,
i
find
you
guilty,
take
him
away.
chief
justice
earl

mr.

chief

well,
is
haines
the

that
we've
talking
about,

psychiatrist
for
the
defense
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
this
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
failure
of
the
defense
psychiatrist
to
be
there
was
because
he
refused
to
come?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
tucker
before
we
pass
to
the
next
case,
the
court
understands
that
you're
appointed
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it's
very
apparent,
the
time
and
energy
you
have
devoted
to
that
cause
and
we
consider
it
a
great
public
service
for
lawyers
to
do
what
you
have
done
in
this
case
and
we
thank
you
and
congratulate
you
on
your
presentation.
and
mr.
michael
may
i
thank
you
also
for
the
diligent
and
fair
manner
in
which
you
have
taken
care
of
the
interest
of
your
state.
