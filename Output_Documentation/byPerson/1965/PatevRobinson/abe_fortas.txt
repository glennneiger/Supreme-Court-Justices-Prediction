justice
abe
fortas
does
illin
--
illinois
law
does
make
a
distinction
between
those
two,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
standards
aren't
different
under
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
was
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
offense
presented
and
ruled
on
by
the
trial
judge?
justice
abe
fortas
and
are
you
telling
us
that
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
is
the
testimony
of
--
is
the
statement
of
the
psychiatrist
with
respect
to
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
request
on
the
part
of
the
respondent's
counsel
to
--
or
process
or
other
procedures
by
which
they
could
produce
psychiatric
testimony
on
the
defendant's
behalf?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
relate
to
moore?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
very
grateful
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
can
i
ask
you
sir,
what
is
the
rule
in
illinois
with
respect
to
burden
of
proof
where
there
is
an
issue
as
to
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
here,
assuming
that
the
judge
concluded
that
all
the
testimony
in
the
record
indicated
rebuttedly
the
presumption
of
sanity
and
then
the
judge
could
have
had
to
find
that
there
had
been
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
insane.
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
i
understand
from
you
said
previously
that
apart
from
the
presumption
of
sanity,
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
sanity
is
the
statement
of
the
psychiatrist
as
to
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon
sir,
but
i
like
to
ask
you
one
further
question.
is
there
anything
to
which
you
could
direct
us
which
we
might
take
all
these
statutory
things
and
anything
else
with
respect
to
the
organization
in
cook
county
of
the
services
available
to
an
indigent
defendant
and
his
counsel
in
the
nature
of
psychiatric
services?
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals
here,
it's
shown
on
page
171
of
the
record,
said
that
one
result
of
the
unusual
case
that
means
the
trial
was
conducted
or
as
the
denial
to
this
indigent
by
a
clear
opportunity
to
obtain
volunteer
expert
testimony
from
a
public
agency.
thus
the
state
dispute
that?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
it's
your
position
that
this
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
was
no
inquiry
into
that
by
the
district
court
to
which
the
habeas
corpus
petition
was
presented?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue?
justice
abe
fortas
the
illinois
law
is
to
the
effect
that
that
--
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
sanity
issue
cannot
be
waived.
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
robinson
now?
justice
abe
fortas
in
an
ordinary
cell
or
is
he
hospitalized
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
notice
that
the
illinois
statute
provides
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
clerk
to
issue
subpoenas
upon
the
request
of
the
prosecution
or
the
defense.
i
seem
--
i'm
a
little
confused
about
illinois
law
in
light
of
comments
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
this
case
as
the
supreme
court
seems
to
refer
to
the
statute
and
then
to
say
that
and
then
indicate
that
since
defendant
did
not
make
a
showing
or
state
some
--
state
to
what
these
witnesses
would
testify
that
had
a
bearing
upon
whether
he
was
entitled
to
the
subpoena.
what
is
your
own
understanding,
is
the
right
to
subpoena
absolute?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
had
been
testimony
that
he
was
in
moore's
apartment,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
any
illinois
cases
dealing
with
the
absolute
or
qualified
nature
of
the
right
to
subpoena?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
michael
i
--
as
i
read
this
record
on
page
161,
the
prosecuting
attorney
suggested
to
the
court
that
a
psychiatrist
ought
to
be
called
that
is
to
say
that
dr.
haines
and
the
court
declined
to
do
so,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
or
do
you
as
the
state
taking
the
position
that
the
court's
attention
was
not
at
all
in
need
for
--
to
the
possibility
of
the
psychiatric
issue
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
little
stranger
than
that
on
page
161,
the
attorney
said,
the
defense
raised
here
by
which
he
means
insanity
as
such
that
i
think
we
should
have
dr.
haines
testimony
as
to
his
opinion
whether
this
man
is
sane
or
insane.
and
the
court
says,
isn't
that
the
fact
that
if
dr.
haines
had
found
him
insane,
dr.
haines
would
report
to
me,
could
not
cooperate
with
his
counsel
so
there
is
more
than
a
suggestion
that
was
in
the
expression
of
the
view
of
the
prosecuting
attorney,
and
it
occurred
after
the
evidence
was
in
before
the
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
no
but
it's
relevant
to
the
issue
of
--
it's
not
determinative
by
any
means
of
course
but
it's
relevant
to
the
issue
of
whether
in
this
record,
there
--
the
presumption
of
sanity
was
brought
in
to
the
extent
that
the
countervailing
evidence
was
necessary
or
whether
the
burden
shifted
to
the
state
to
prove
sanity.
