justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
can
be
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
that.
you
say
he
did
not
raise
the
insanity
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
has
to
his
competency
to
stand
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
[inaudible]
or
something
--
i
guess
that
was
executing
an
insane.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
federal
formulation,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
deliberate
bypass
by
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
him
individually?
i
mean
my
difficulty
is
that
if
indeed
he
was
incompetent,
if
indeed
he
was,
how
could
he
weigh
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there's
nothing
i
gather,
except
the
fact
that
no
request
was
made.
that's
the
only
evidence
there
on
which
you
rest
the
conclusion
of
waiver
that
no
request
was
made
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
remember
in
henry,
we
said
that
indeed
there
are
some
things
that
counsel
may
waive
on
behalf
of
the
accused.
you
recall
in
that
case
that
there
were
some
affirmative
evidence
alleged
that
one
counsel
pulled
the
other
down
or
something
before
he
was
making
an
objection
and
that
we
thought
became
perhaps
a
basis
of
waiver
that's
in
fact
for
a
hearing.
but
here,
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
except
that
no
request
was
made
and
that
the
defense
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
were
asserted
there's
nothing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
just
ask
of
the
fact
--
was
it
after
--
he
killed
his
child
early.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
176,
isn't
that
where
the
court
of
appeals
stated
the
illinois
rule
as
being
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
requirement
of
affirmative
proofs
from
the
state
on
an
insanity
defense
unless
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
counter
the
presumption,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
at
171
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
where
the
rule
is
stated,
the
state
must
prove
the
sanity
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
crime.
that
burden
to
satisfy
illinois
by
the
presumption
of
sanity
until
the
introduction
of
evidence
efficient
to
raise
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
defendant's
sanity
at
which
time
and
only
then
as
i
read
this,
the
necessity
of
affirmative
proof
of
sanity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
becomes
a
burden
of
the
state.
is
that
the
illinois
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
by
which
you
mean,
you
feel
you're
entitled
to
a
judgment
requiring
the
state
within
x
days
or
something
to
give
him
a
new
trial
or
else
discharged,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
except
i
thought
mr.
michael
said
this.
i
don't
think
i've
read
that.
if
i
have,
i
have
forgotten
it.
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
this
case
that
mr.
michael
i
think
told
us
held
that
the
lay
testimony
here
was
not
sufficient
to
do
whatever
--
it
does
to
the
presumption
and
require
the
state
to
offer
affirmative
proofs.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i'm
confused
about
is
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
said
on
the
record
here,
no
affirmative
evidence
was
required
from
the
state,
where
does
that
leave
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
see
that
what
you
say
is
so
and
we
should
agree
with
you
that
that
should
lead
us
to
say
that
this
fellow
should
be
discharged
rather
than
to
get
a
new
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
in
--
this
was
a
psychiatrist
he
wanted
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
could
you
--
can
you
compel
psychiatrist,
a
medical
man
to
testify
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two
of
them,
were
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
what
is
your
procedure
ordinarily
when
you
want
a
sanity
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
what
--
what
the
lawyers
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
affirmatively?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
there
any
explanation
why
that
wasn't
done
in
the
face
of
this
testimony
to
which
you
referred
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
what
we
did
in
jackson
and
denno?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
what
we
did
in
jackson
and
denno?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
new
york
and
not
the
district
--
of
the
new
york
courts
and
not
the
federal
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
difference
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
it's
inappropriate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
not
that
for
some
--
something
about
the
habeas
corpus
like
for
powers
to
order
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
issued
the
writ
in
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
is
it
--
what
is
it
about
the
federal
district
court
that
makes
it
a
better
forum
than
the
state
courts
to
determine
these
question
of
robinson's
sanity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
your
first
submission
is
that
there's
been
a
finding
now
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
constitutional
violation.
your
complaint
is
that
they
sent
it
back
for
plenary
hearing
instead
of
ordering
the
state
either
to
give
one
within
a
limited
time
for
the
discharge
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
first
and
now
you're
arguing
on
the
premise
you
don't
--
we
don't
agree
that
we
should
go
that
far.
you're
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
having
these
hearings
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
how
--
what
goes
into
a
determination
i
suppose
on
getting
him
a
sanity
hearing
now,
is
the
sanity
hearing
is
to
what,
his
competency
to
stand
trial
when
he
was
tried?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
you
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
what
it
looked
like
at
that
time,
how
he
acted
at
that
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
you
going
to
capture
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
what
--
what's
the
law,
what's
the
standard
that
the
district
court
would
apply,
the
state
standard
in
either
of
these
instances
or
some
federal
standard
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
been
asked,
what
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
to
get
into
that
match
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
illinois
has
(voice
overlap)
modified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
[inaudible].
you
say
that
he
was
denied
procedural
due
process
and
therefore
you
want
us
to
reverse
on
that
ground.
what
procedure
without
going
into
details,
what
procedure
was
he
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
thing
that
i
don't
understand,
how
--
is
it
the
illinois
supreme
court
sustained
this.
if
you're
right
that
in
effect,
what
was
developed
during
the
trial
had
precisely
--
should
have
been
treated
precisely
as
if
counsel
at
the
trial
had
formally
made
a
motion
to
convene
a
sanity
hearing.
that's
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
when
a
formal
motion
is
made
then
there
has
to
be
a
separate
proceeding
in
the
determination
before
a
jury
is
that
right?
now
how
was
--
if
that's
the
procedure,
how
was
that
consistent
with
the
illinois
supreme
court's
affirmance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
gather
is
how
--
how
can
we
be
sure
that's
--
what
you
have
told
us
was
illinois
law
in
the
face
of
the
supreme
court's
affirmance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
there
is
the
conflict
i
know
in
my
home
state,
you
can't
compel
an
expert
to
give
opinion
evidence
unless
paying
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
illinois
too?
