mr.
john
c.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
contend
that
the
respondent,
theodore
robinson
was
denied
his
federal
constitutional
right
in
his
trial
in
the
state
court
in
illinois
on
a
charge
of
murder
in
several
particular
respects.
specifically,
he
was
denied
his
right
to
due
process
by
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
convene
a
jury
to
hold
a
hearing
on
the
sanity
of
mr.
robinson
at
the
time
of
the
trial
or
to
afford
him
a
fair
hearing
of
any
sort
on
that
issue
despite
the
fact
that
the
evidence
clearly
suggests
the
issue
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial
or
insanity
at
the
time
of
trial.
secondly,
we
believe
that
the
undisputed
evidence
shows
that
mr.
robinson
was
in
fact
insane
at
the
time
of
the
allegedly
criminal
act
and
that
to
convict
a
man
for
acts
committed
while
insane
violates
due
process
of
law.
we
believe
in
addition
to
that
that
regardless
of
whether
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
necessarily
a
constitutionally
protected
defense
that
in
illinois,
the
law
is
clear
that
the
court
or
that
the
state
must
prove
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
an
essential
element
of
its
case
wherever
that
issue
is
raised
and
that
therefore
the
failure
of
the
state
to
adduce
any
evidence
on
that
issue
and
the
conviction
of
the
defendant
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
support
an
essential
of
the
crime
violates
due
process.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
your
honor,
the
law
in
illinois
is
very
clear
that
the
presumption
of
sanity
as
it
is
called
is
not
an
evidentiary
presumption.
in
people
versus
monroe,
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
they
have
held
this
consistently
and
have
always
held,
that
there
is
no
evidentiary
value
in
the
presumption
of
insanity.
it
is
simply
a
means
of
avoiding,
forcing
the
state
to
raise
the
issue
itself
if
the
defendant
doesn't
raise
it.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
is.
and
i
--
i
may
as
well
state
right
now
that
we
are
asking
for
more
relief
than
we
obtained
from
the
court
of
appeals.
we
received
from
the
court
of
appeals
an
opinion
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
this
case
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
a
full
plenary
hearing
as
counsel
for
the
state
has
--
has
told
you.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
issued
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
case
and
i
might
say
at
this
time
that
the
reason
that
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
raise
that
to
this
court
is
because
of
the
special
question
that
was
certified
by
this
court
in
which
this
court
asked
whether
or
not
any
further
proceedings
should
be
held
in
the
state
court
rather
than
in
the
federal
district
court.
now
i'll
get
to
this
later
but
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
only
way
that
it
can
ever
be
any
further
proceedings
in
the
state
court
is
if
this
court
decide
--
or
the
federal
court
at
some
point
decides
that
there
were
violations
of
constitutional
rights
and
if
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
should
issue
because
this
court
has
no
power
--
the
federal
courts
have
no
power
on
habeas
corpus
to
remand
the
case.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
such
an
order
and
i
believe
even
beyond
that
that
with
respect
to
this
issue
that
we've
just
been
discussing,
the
failure
to
--
the
failure
to
afford
the
defendant
--
pardon
me,
the
failure
of
the
state
to
introduce
any
evidence
to
prove
an
essential
element
of
its
case
would
require
an
unconditional
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
was
sufficient
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
sanity
because
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
mental
illness
that
had
resulted
in
robinson's
commitment
to
a
mental
institution
was
of
a
continuing
or
permanent
nature.
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
points
out
this
completely
overlooked
about
two-thirds
of
the
most
important
evidence
in
this
case.
now
i
do
want
to
say
one
other
thing
on
that
issue
and
that
is,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
testimony
for
the
defendant
being
the
testimony
of
lay
witnesses.
illinois
clearly
recognizes
the
right
of
the
lay
witness
to
testify
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
your
honor,
we
think
number
one,
it
leads
you
in
a
position
to
say
first
that
the
record
clearly
does
not
clearly
--
the
record
taken
as
a
whole
clearly
does
not
fairly
support
that
finding.
number
two,
that
there
was
clearly
an
inadequate
determination,
that
the
hearing
in
the
state
court
was
clearly
inadequate
to
determine
all
the
material
facts.
we
believe
that
it's
very
apparent
from
this
record
that
there
was
a
fundamental
denial
of
due
process
in
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
by
the
(voice
overlap)
this
trial
was
conducted.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well
your
honor,
there
are
two
separate
questions
here.
i
think
that
it
is
very
apparent
from
the
record
that
the
most
likely
order
would
be
that
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
would
be
issued
affording
the
state
an
opportunity
to
give
the
defendant
a
new
trial.
it
is
only
because
we
do
make
the
additional
contention
that
there
was
a
total
failure.
we
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
simply
was
not
correct
in
giving
any
--
in
saying
there
was
no
evidence
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
crime.
i
believe
i
was
to
the
point
of
saying
that
we
also
believe
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
of
the
fundamental
right
to
a
fair
trial
by
the
conduct
of
this
trial
as
the
court
below
stated
in
an
atmosphere
of
haste
by
a
failure
to
afford
the
defendant,
robinson,
an
adequate
opportunity
to
obtain
the
testimony
of
important
witnesses
on
all
of
the
issues,
issues
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
crime
and
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
finally
your
honors,
we
believe
that
there
was
a
clear
denial
of
robinson's
sixth
amendment
right
to
compulsory
process
by
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
issue
a
subpoena
for
a
witness
when
mr.
robinson
specifically
asked
that
the
witness
be
subpoenaed
by
the
court.
and
the
court
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no,
this
is
a
different
witness
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
a
subpoena
if
issued
and
served,
i
suppose
could
be
enforced
as
a
practical
matter
at
least
it
can
be
enforced
within
a
reason.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena
for
a
professional
man
seems
to
me
to
be
a
difficult
thing
for
a
lawyer
to
do.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
that's
correct.
the
point
here
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
address
this
right
at
this
moment
although
i
will
get
back
to
it.
with
respect
to
the
psychiatrist,
the
counsel
for
the
defense
during
the
second
day
of
this
trial
suddenly
realized
that
they
were
going
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
case
that
day.
the
court
is
--
again,
will
get
into.
the
court
had
been
pushing
this
trial
as
a
race
against
time
with
an
incredible
number
of
situations
where
he
chastised
defense
counsel
for
wasting
a
minute
here
or
a
minute
there.
and
finally,
this
is
all
culminated
in
a
situation
where
the
defense
counsel
realized
that
this
case
was
going
to
end,
this
capital
case
and
really
about
a
day
and
out.
and
he
informed
the
court
that
he
had
contacted
this
psychiatric
witness
and
that
he
was
unable
to
reach
him
that
day,
but
as
he
said,
i
am
sure
we
will
be
able
to
have
him
in
here
tomorrow
morning.
and
the
court
said
if
--
at
that
point,
the
court
said,
if
you
subpoenaed
him,
i'll
issue
a
capias
but
if
you
didn't,
it's
too
bad,
you've
got
to
prepare
your
case
before
trial.
if
you
didn't
subpoena
him,
we
will
not
delay
the
trial
for
him.
we
have
other
cases
waiting.
we've
been
on
trial
here
now
for
two
days
and
we
cannot
wait
for
this
man.
and
as
a
result,
the
trial
ended
that
afternoon
without
the
live
testimony
of
a
single
expert
witness
in
this
case
and
that
we
think
is
a
clear
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
had
discussed
the
several,
separate
situations
or
examples
in
which
we
contend
due
process
was
violated
by
robinson's
trial
in
the
state
court
on
the
charge
of
murder.
when
all
of
these
separate
issues
are
taken
together
and
when
the
record
in
this
case
is
examined
as
a
whole,
there
is
one
picture
i
submit
which
emerges
with
particular
clarity
and
beyond
any
question
and
that
is
taken
as
a
whole,
mr.
robinson
was
clearly
denied
his
fundamental
right
to
procedural
due
process,
his
fundamental
right
to
a
fair
trial
by
the
conduct
of
his
trial
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county,
illinois.
and
i
think
that
picture
is
perhaps
best
expressed
in
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
reversed
the
district
court's
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
without
hearing
and
ordered
the
plenary
hearing
to
be
held.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
“robinson's
trial
was
conducted
under
an
undo
preoccupation
with
hurried
disposition,
in
an
atmosphere
charged
with
haste
hardly
consistent
with
the
gravity
of
a
capital
case
and
production
of
the
right
--
and
protection
of
the
right
to
due
process.”
and
then
it
went
on,
“robinson
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
an
unduly
hurried
trial
without
a
fair
opportunity
to
obtain
necessary
expert
psychiatric
testimony
in
his
behalf.
without
sufficient
development
of
facts
on
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
homicide
and
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
upon
a
record
which
does
not
show
that
the
state
court
after
a
full
hearing
reliably
found
the
relevant
facts”
and
that
i
submit
is
a
very
clear
and
correct
picture
of
the
record
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
correct
and
finding
that
when
the
district
court
failed
to
require
the
state
to
even
file
a
return
to
this
petition,
failed
to
appoint
counsel
and
failed
to
hold
plenary
hearings
that
in
light
of
the
failure
of
the
record
to
show
that
the
state
court
had
held
a
full
hearing
and
reliably
found
the
facts
that
a
plenary
hearing
was
necessary.
we
believe
also,
however,
that
the
record
on
its
face
clearly
shows
that
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
in
this
trial
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
findings
actually
support
that
and
that
what
should
have
been
done
was
that
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
should
have
issued
conditioned
upon
permitting
the
state
sufficient
time
to
afford
robinson
a
new
trial.
now
the
state
on
the
other
hand
of
course
contends
that
the
district
court's
denial
of
the
petition
should
be
reinstated.
they
contend
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
would
have
required
a
sanity
hearing
pursuant
to
the
state
law
and
that
in
any
event
the
right
to
a
sanity
hearing
was
waived
and
they
further
contend
that
the
claim
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
crime
is
--
does
not
raise
federal
constitutional
issues
and
is
not
cognizable
in
habeas
corpus.
as
we
see
it,
the
state
has
not
even
turned
its
attention
at
all
either
in
the
briefs
or
in
the
argument
here
to
the
failure
to
afford
the
defendant
fundamental
due
process
by
failing
to
afford
him
a
fair
trial
by
denying
an
adequate
opportunity
to
obtain
witnesses.
in
many
respects
then
this
case
is
a
fact
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
all
that
mr.
mcdermott
is
saying
at
this
point
is
during
the
trial
he
had
told
the
court
that
he
had
an
expert
witness
that
he
wanted
to
call
the
next
day
and
your
honor
will
recall,
the
court
said
well
if
you
subpoenaed
him,
alright,
but
if
you
didn't,
we're
not
going
to
continue
this
case
for
two
hours,
you've
got
to
prepare
your
case
in
advance.
i
think
mcdermott
is
simply
here
explaining
the
fact
that
he
had
not
subpoenaed
the
psychiatrist
because
he
didn't
believe
in
it.
he
was
never
given
an
opportunity.
this
certainly
does
not
in
any
way
dispute
the
statement
he
made
during
the
trial
that
he
had
an
expert
witness
that
would
be
available
the
next
day.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing
and
this
is
perhaps
in
a
delicate
area
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
the
portion
of
the
record
that
you
are
reading
occurred
after
the
defendant
had
been
found
guilty,
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment,
ordered
taken
out
of
the
courtroom,
the
court
case
--
the
next
case
was
called,
really
an
amazing
procedure
here
at
the
end
in
which
the
court
just
clearly
have
held
no
hearing
on
aggravation
or
mitigation,
it
wanted
to
get
this
guy
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
defendant,
robinson,
at
this
point
had
said
to
the
court,
your
honor,
i
think
my
counsel
must
have
been
incompetent
if
they
didn't
subpoena
witness
and
you
say
that
you
won't
let
me
have
these
witnesses
unless
they're
subpoenaed
and
i
think
my
counsel
must
have
been
incompetent.
he
was
then
taken
out
of
the
court
room
and
these
statements
by
his
counsel
were
made.
now
i
don't
really
think
that
they're
entitled
in
any
weight
at
all
under
these
circumstances
but
in
any
event,
they
certainly
do
not
in
any
way
take
away
from
his
counsel
statement
during
the
trial
that
he
wanted
to
call
an
expert
witness
and
would
have
him
available
the
next
morning.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
--
that's
correct.
that's
correct
your
honor.
he
says
that
there
is
a
claim
in
here
by
the
counsel
at
this
point
with
respect
to
the
--
with
respect
to
the
moores.
this
is
the
sixth
amendment
question.
the
defendant
mr.
robinson
had
specifically
asked
the
court
to
subpoena
two
witnesses
who
were
--
who
--
in
whose
home
he
had
stayed
after
the
crime
and
he
would
have
the
best
opportunity
perhaps
of
anyone
to
observe
his
behavior
at
that
time.
the
court
said,
what
will
they
testify
to?
and
the
defendant
said,
i
don't
know.
and
the
court
said,
well
unless
you
can
tell
us
what
he
is
going
--
they're
going
to
testify
to,
i
won't
issue
a
subpoena
for
them.
now
it
appeared
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
dispute
between
defendant
and
his
counsel
with
respect
to
calling
the
moores
and
the
defendant's
counsel
didn't
want
to
call
them
and
the
defendant
said,
i
want
a
subpoena
issued
for
the
moores
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
he
made
that
statement
again
to
the
court.
and,
once
again,
as
your
honor
points
out
then
after
he
was
taken
out
of
the
courtroom,
his
counsel
made
a
self-serving
statement
about
that
why
he
hadn't
subpoenaed
the
moores.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that's
correct,
two
of
them.
now
the
state
as
i
understand
it
concedes
that
due
process
prohibits
the
trial
of
an
insane
man
and
if
they
don't
concede
that
this
court
has
certainly
held
it
in
bishop
versus
united
states
and
[inaudible].
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
specifically
holds
that
due
process
prohibits
the
trial
of
a
man
who
is
insane
and
that
the
failure
to
give
him
a
hearing
on
his
sanity
when
that
issue
is
raised
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
now
in
people
versus
burson,
11
illinois
2d
360,
that
--
that
question
was
specifically
treated
by
the
court
and
they
said,
the
trial
adjudication
sentence
or
execution
of
a
person
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
while
insane
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
and
it
becomes
the
duty
if
that
issue
is
raised
of
the
court
to
conduct
the
hearing
before
a
jury
upon
the
issue
and
the
denial
thereof
as
a
violation
of
due
process
and
i
think
that's
clear.
and
as
mr.
michael
has
conceded
certainly,
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
a
sanity
hearing
is
heard
--
is
held
in
illinois
and
that
is
by
the
convening
of
a
jury.
the
court
does
not
conduct
the
hearing
on
sanity.
the
fact
of
this
case
is
that
there
was
no
hearing
on
this
man's
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
admits
that
and
the
law
is
very
clear
on
that.
i
think
there
has
been
some
confusion
with
respect
to
the
law
on
how
this
issue
is
raised.
it
is
not
so
that
the
issue
must
be
raised
by
specific
request
of
the
defendant
or
his
counsel.
in
fact,
the
illinois
law
clearly
recognizes
that
it
is
impossible
for
an
incompetent
person
to
waive
this
right
and
i
think
that
has
been
recognized
throughout
jurisprudence
and
in
fact,
in
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct.
the
illinois
law
provides
that
whenever
facts
come
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
whether
by
a
suggestion
of
counsel
or
from
the
evidence
itself
which
suggest
a
doubt
as
to
defendant's
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial,
he
must
interrupt
the
trial,
convene
a
jury
and
hold
a
hearing
on
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial.
now,
we
think
it
is
clear
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
then
that
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
hold
such
a
hearing
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no,
your
honor.
i
cite
bishop
only
for
the
proposition
that
to
--
that
it
would
violate
due
process
to
try
a
man
on
a
criminal
charge
while
he
is
insane.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
united
states
versus
bishop,
your
honor.
that
case
was
a
per
curiam
remand.
as
i
understand
it
in
that
case,
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
did
not
raise
constitutional
issues
and
was
not
cognizable
on
habeas
corpus
and
this
court
in
a
per
curiam
remand
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
saying
they
had
the
whole
hearings
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
i
think
that
by
inference
your
honor,
if
--
if
it
were
not
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
that
the
issues
framed
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
understand
that.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
bishop
probably
is
as
close
as
the
opinions
of
this
court
come
to
my
knowledge
on
that
issue.
i
think
that
us
ex
rel
smith
versus
baldi
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
believe
that
that
case
certainly
the
opinion
of
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
frankfurter
in
that
case
indicate
that
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial,
that
--
that
--
that
due
process
would
prohibit
if
in
fact
it
occurred
the
trial
of
a
man
while
he
was
insane
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
incidentally
clearly
holds.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
--
i
believe
your
honor
and
i
can't
recall
the
cases,
i
believe
the
court
has
held
that
he
cannot
be
tried
in
the
event
and
of
course
it
would
be
the
same
thing.
i
think
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i'm
sorry
justice
black,
i
don't
know
that
case.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
but
i
think
that
the
law
is
clear
and
to
answer
your
question
directly,
i
think
that
necessarily
the
court
by
its
remand
in
bishop
was
indicating
that
it
would
violate
due
process
to
try
a
man
while
he
was
insane
and
as
i
say,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
certainly
has
no
doubt
about
it.
they
say
in
so
many
words,
the
trial
adjudication
sentence
or
execution
of
a
person
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
while
insane
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
and
i
think
that
clearly
is
the
rule.
now
the
petitioner
then
is
–
the
state
illinois
is
left
with
the
proposition
first
of
all
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
would
require
the
canvassing
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
robinson
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
that
this
question
in
effect
was
not
raised
by
the
evidence
because
as
i
have
indicated
under
illinois
law
if
it
is
raised
by
the
evidence,
the
court
has
the
duty
itself
to
convene
this
sanity
hearing.
in
fact,
however,
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
record
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
that
the
failure
to
conduct
the
sanity
hearing
in
the
face
of
this
evidence
deprived
robinson
of
due
process.
the
--
and
again,
before
mentioning
this
evidence,
i
want
to
particularly
emphasis
the
fact
that
here,
there
was
no
hearing
at
all
because
the
judge
cannot
conduct
this
hearing.
it's
strictly,
it's
something
that
he
has
to
convene
a
jury
for.
now
mr.
michael
has
outlined
the
evidence
in
--
in
brief
with
respect
to
this
issue.
there
were
four
live
witnesses,
all
of
who
testified
that
they
believe
in
their
opinion
that
mr.
robinson
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
that
in
itself
in
my
opinion
raises
the
issue
and
triggers
the
responsibility
of
the
state
court
to
determine
the
issue,
but
this
was
not
just
the
opinion
of
these
witnesses.
this
was
backed
up
by
a
long
set
of
facts
with
respect
to
mr.
robinson's
past
history.
you've
heard
about
the
--
the
situation
when
he
was
struck
in
the
head
with
a
brick
when
he
was
a
--
a
young
boy.
you
heard
about
the
situation
in
which
he
destroyed
furniture
in
his
mother's
home
without
any
apparent
cause.
the
glaring
moods
that
he
was
observed
to
be
in,
apparent
lack
of
ability
to
communicate
with
the
people
around
him.
the
fact
that
during
his
employment
after
he
was
released
from
the
army,
he
often
walked
off
his
--
his
job
in
apparent
daze
for
no
reason
and
you
have
heard
to
some
extent
about
this
incident
that
caused
his
commitment
to
by
court
order
incidentally
to
the
kankakee
state
hospital,
an
illinois
mental
institution.
this
was
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant
robinson
had
a
complete
mental
breakdown.
he
believed
people
were
trying
to
kill
him.
he
believed
people
were
trying
to
kill
his
mother.
a
policeman
that
was
called
entered
the
room
and
said
he's
lost
his
mind
entirely,
we'll
have
to
take
him
to
the
hospital.
he
tried
to
commit
suicide
by
jumping
out
of
the
ambulance
on
the
way
to
the
hospital
and
eventually
he
was
committed
to
the
kankakee
state
hospital.
now
it's
true
as
mr.
michael
points
out
that
the
record
of
the
kankakee
state
hospital
which
was
introduced
in
the
evidence
by
the
defendant
shows
that
he
had
been
drinking
and
that
there
was
some
alcoholic
influence
here,
but
it
also
shows
that
the
psychiatrist
who
examined
him
had
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
paranoid
schizophrenic,
or
i
believe
schizophrenic
was
the
word.
the
record
shows,
i
wonder
if
he
isn't
schizophrenic.
now
after
he
was
released
from
the
hospital
and
from
that
point
on,
the
illinois
supreme
court
says
--
said,
there
was
no
evidence
that
his
illness
was
of
an
enduring
or
continuing
nature,
but
here's
what
happened
after
that
that
was
in
this
record.
his
mother
testified
that
she
--
that
he
was
released
from
the
hospital
to
the
custody
of
his
wife
who
was
in
effect
starving
and
went
in
and
begged
and
--
that
he'd
be
released
and
that's
why
they
finally
decided
to
release
him.
his
mother
thought
he
was
still
insane
then.
he
at
one
point
took
out
his
wife's
clothes
out
of
their
home
and
tried
to
burn
them
in
the
backyard.
in
1953
i
believe
it
was
as
the
state
has
told
you,
he
murdered
his
18-month-old
baby
boy
by
shooting
him
in
the
head.
he
had
--
his
wife
had
left
him,
he
had
no
place
to
go.
he
went
to
his
aunt's
house
and
asked
if
he
could
stay
overnight
and
when
his
aunt
came
back
the
next
day
from
work,
robinson's
18-month-old
baby
boy
had
been
slain
in
the
living
room
of
this
apartment
and
robinson
then
attempted
to
commit
suicide
in
two
different
ways
and
eventually
gave
himself
up
to
the
police.
when
he
was
brought
into
the
hospital,
he
was
observed
to
be
in
one
of
these
trance
like
daze
moods
that
had
been
testified
about
previously
in
his
history.
mr.
michael
refers
to
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
of
murder
for
that.
that
is
not
so.
the
record
is
very
unclear,
but
it
is
clear
that
he
served
four
years
whether
in
a
penitentiary
or
in
a
mental
hospital
is
not
clear
but
the
--
the
penalty
for
a
murder
in
illinois
is
14
years
and
you
can't
get
out
for
four
years.
so
it's
very
apparent
that
this
was
on
some
sort
of
a
reduced
sentence
and
i'm
completely
off
the
record,
but
i
guess
from
my
knowledge
of
illinois
procedure
is
that
in
view
of
the
obvious
insanity
defense,
some
sort
of
a
deal
was
worked
out
where
he
would
get
a
man
slaughter
charge
or
something
of
that
sort.
after
he
was
released
from
wherever
he
was,
but
it
was,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
was
committed,
i
think
it
was
a
penal
institution
although
perhaps
he's
criminally
insane,
after
he
was
released
from
there,
the
evidence
continues
with
respect
to
further
showings
of
insanity.
a
number
of
people,
four
lay
witnesses
all
continued
that
--
he
continued
to
have
these
moods
in
which
he
appeared
to
be
days,
uncommunicated,
depressed
and
these
moods
were
very
often
accompanied
by
unexpected
flare
of
violence.
a
warrant
was
sought
by
his
mother.
now
mr.
michael
says,
a
warrant
was
sought
because
he
had
been
fighting.
well
there
was
some
mentioned
at
the
back
that
he
had
been
fighting
but
the
precise
testimony
that
his
mother
gave
on
that
subject
was
this.
i
went
to
48
street
station
and
took
out
a
warrant
and
i
told
them
that
i
wanted
--
what
i
wanted
with
him.
i
told
him
that
my
son
seemed
to
have
a
disturbed
mind
with
things
he
was
doing.
he
is
not
normal
and
i
wish
you
would
help
me
to
pick
him
up
so
i
can
have
him
put
away.
now
that's
what
his
mother
wanted.
his
mother
had
--
attempting
to
have
him
again
committed
and
this
warrant
was
taken
out
with
the
first
one
about
a
year
before
the
homicide
in
this
case
and
she
tried
again,
and
the
record
is
a
little
unclear
but
within
a
month
or
two
to
have
him
picked
up
and
he
--
unfortunately,
the
warrant
was
never
served.
he
was
to
be
picked
up
for
recommitment
to
a
mental
institute.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
of
the
homicide
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
he
is
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
do
not
know.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
at
the
time
of
the
homicide
here,
the
evidence
adduced
by
the
state
showed
an
amazing
similarity
to
the
testimony
of
the
defendant's
witnesses
with
respect
to
robinson's
conduct
and
this
again
is
something
that
is
not
previously
been
mentioned.
when
mr.
robinson
walked
into
this
restaurant
where
the
shooting
occurred,
the
testimony
reveals
that
he
walked
up
to
the
counter
in
the
front
of
the
restaurant
about
four
feet
away
from
the
victim
with
a
gun
in
his
hand.
and
he
stood
and
he
stared
for
--
the
testimony
was
--
about
--
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
about
two
minutes,
he
stood
and
he
stared
without
saying
a
word
at
this
woman.
he
then
turned
away
and
walked
20
feet
back
to
the
back
of
the
restaurant,
jumped
over
the
counter
placing
two
people
between
himself
and
the
defendant
and
then
ran
around
through
the
front
behind
this
counter
and
the
defendant
there,
the
deceased
then
jumped
over
the
counter
and
robinson
--
shots
were
heard
and
the
deceased
was
found
outside.
this
conduct
during
--
throughout
incidentally
this
whole
time,
robinson
did
not
say
a
single
word.
this
same
daze
thing
in
which
he
stood
and
glared
this
woman
for
two
woman
--
for
two
minutes
and
then
walked
away
from
her.
so
we
believe
your
honor
that
the
evidence
here
clearly
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
robinson
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
lay
witnesses
specifically
stated
that
they
believe
that
he
was
contrary
to
what
mr.
michael
says,
the
defense
counsel
did
indicate
that
they
felt
this
was
an
issue.
they
raised
it
by
questions
and
they
raised
it
by
statements.
the
evidence
raised
it
and
certainly
the
failure
to
convene
a
sanity
hearing
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
--
my
statement
on
questioning,
the
following
question
was
asked
at
the
record
at
page
157.
do
you
have
an
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
presently
he
is
sane
or
insane?
answer:
he
is
sick.
he
is
insane.
first
of
all,
do
you
have
an
opinion?
yes.
what
is
your
opinion
as
to
his
present
sanity?
answer,
he
is
mentally
sick.
that's
after
the
questions
were
asked
about
insanity
at
the
time
of
crime.
in
the
closing
argument
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
there
was
also
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
defenses
was
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
one
of
them,
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
now
in
addition
to
this
evidence
or
i
should
say,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
we
think
the
record
clearly
required
a
sanity
hearing,
it's
also
clear
if
the
court
please
that
the
conduct
of
the
trial
with
respect
to
this
issue
and
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
under
illinois
law
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
if
the
lawyer
wants
the
sanity
hearing,
he
requests
the
sanity
hearing
from
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
he
affirmatively
requests,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
glad
you
mentioned
that.
i
left
that
out.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
the
conduct
again
matched
perfectly
with
the
conduct
at
the
time
of
the
many
other
incidents
of
this
sort.
mr.
robinson
was
arrested
outside
or
in
the
hallway
of
an
apartment
building.
two
uniformed
police
officers
testified
that
they
had
gotten
off
the
elevator
in
that
hallway
and
that
they
have
seen
robinson's
hanging
there
but
they
didn't
know
who
he
was.
they
didn't
have
any
description
of
who
they
are
looking
for.
they
walked
past
him
without
any
recognition,
down
the
hall
to
the
apartment
of
the
people
who
had
called
them.
they
stood
and
talked
to
the
people
in
that
apartment
for
approximately
two
minutes.
when
they
received
the
description
of
robinson
and
found
out
that
he
wasn't
there
and
had
just
left,
they
turned
around
to
go
back
to
the
elevator
and
there
was
mr.
robinson
standing
in
the
same
position
that
he
had
been
in
before.
he
had
not
--
he
wouldn't
have
to
go
back
by
the
officers
to
get
to
the
elevator
and
the
record
is
very
clear
on
this
and
brought
out
for
cross-examination.
he
had
stood
there
and
watched
these
uniformed
officers
go
to
the
apartment
where
he
had
been
--
where
he
had
been
staying
and
stood
there
without
trying
to
get
to
the
elevator
and
go
down
the
stairs
for
two
minutes
while
they
talked
to
the
people
and
submitted
himself
to
arrest.
they
asked
him
his
name,
he
told
them
his
name.
they
told
him
he
was
under
arrest
that
he
appeared
completely
confused
as
to
why.
now
i
don't
say
that
the
fact
that
he
didn't
know
why
--
he
said
he
didn't
know
why
he
was
being
arrested
was
--
is
determinative
of
the
fact
that
he
was
accused
but
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
didn't
have
any
knowledge
of
why
he
was
being
arrested
and
he
stood
there
for
two
minutes
in
full
with
these
officers
in
his
view
without
trying
to
escape.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
apparently
not.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
they
were
found
in
this
apartment
--
in
this
apartment
where
the
police
officers
went.
now
we
talked
about
the
way
in
which
this
trial
was
conducted
and
that's
another
factor,
both
on
the
issue
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial
and
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
the
court
of
appeals
referred
with
great
particularity
to
the
number
of
occasions
in
which
the
trial
judge
has
chastised
the
defense
lawyers
to
hurry
along
on
their
presentation.
this
capital
case
lasted
from
11
o'clock
one
morning
until
about
2:30
in
the
afternoon
the
next
day
and
yet,
despite
its
--
the
shortness
of
it,
there
were
these
constant
attempts
to
hurry
the
proceeding,
in
a
real
atmosphere
of
haste
and
i
think
it's
perhaps
best
revealed
by
the
proceedings
at
the
very
end
in
which
the
trial
judge,
as
soon
as
the
defense
lawyer
finished
his
summation
without
even
asking
if
there
was
any
rebuttal,
the
trial
judge
said,
bring
him
to
the
bench.
i
find
you
guilty
of
murder,
i
sentenced
you
to
life
imprisonment,
take
him
away,
call
the
next
case.
that's
literally
the
way
the
transcript
on
that
reads.
and
the
defense
--
the
defendant
himself
said,
your
honor
may
i
say
something
and
he
then
addressed
the
court
about
--
he
didn't
think
his
counsel
were
competent
and
so
forth
and
the
court
interrupted
him
and
said,
still
and
all,
i
think
you're
guilty.
take
him
away
and
call
the
next
case.
that
--
that's
the
atmosphere
of
this
trial.
now
it
was
for
that
reason
and
i
think
very
clearly
when
you
read
the
record,
it
was
for
that
reason
that
when
mr.
robinson
asked
to
have
the
moores
subpoenaed
that
the
court
would
not
issue
a
subpoena
for
the
moores.
it
wasn't
that
robin
--
the
court
knew
better
than
--
that
robinson
had
to
tell
him
what
the
moore
is
going
to
testify
to.
he
didn't
want
to
interrupt
the
trial.
it
also
occurred
again
and
had
another
effect
with
respect
to
dr.
haines
and
i
think
this
is
a
very
significant
thing
in
this
case.
the
state's
attorney
himself
--
the
state
attorney
had
put
in
the
stipulated
evidence
of
dr.
haines
that
robinson
was
competent.
let's
see.
robinson
understood
the
nature
of
the
charges
and
could
cooperate
with
counsel
but
recognizing
that
this
was
not
a
complete
answer
to
all
of
the
evidence
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
trial
and
no
answer
at
all
on
insanity
at
the
time
of
crime,
the
state's
attorney
said,
your
honor,
dr.
haines
is
not
available.
i
--
not
available
now.
i
proceeded
on
the
assumption
after
having
talked
to
mr.
carey
that
dr.
haines'
testimony
to
both
matters
would
go
in
by
stipulation.
now
the
defense
raised
here
is
such
that
i
think
we
should
have
dr.
haines'
testimony,
as
to
his
opinion
whether
this
man
is
sane
--
is
now
sane.
it
is
possible
that
the
man
might
be
insane
and
know
the
nature
of
the
charge
or
be
able
to
cooperate
with
his
counsel.
i
think
it
should
be
in
evidence
your
honor.
in
other
words,
he
wanted
to
call
dr.
haines
as
a
live
witness.
but
the
court
said,
no,
i
don't
think
you
need
dr.
haines
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
last
bit
of
colloquy
in
the
record,
right
after
that,
the
arguments
began.
so
that
this
case
ended
without
any
expert
psychiatric
testimony
despite
the
fact
that
both
the
defense
counsel
and
the
state's
attorney
wanted
to
have
psychiatric
testimony
in
this
record.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
he
is
and
there
was
some
statement
by
the
defendant
on
his
own
behalf
to
the
effect
that
he
--
why
didn't
they
get
the
moores
and
he
wanted
the
moores
subpoenaed
and
his
counsel
must
have
been
incompetent
not
to
have
gotten
subpoenas
and
the
court
then
interrupted
them
and
said,
still
and
all,
i
think
you're
guilty
regardless
of
that
and
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
none
at
all
your
honor,
none
at
all.
nor
was
there
any
suggestion
of
a
hearing
on
aggravation
and
mitigation
and
that
is
provided
for
an
illinois
law
too.
i
don't
contend
that
that
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
i
think
perhaps
it
has
to
be
asked
for,
but
it's
the
atmosphere
i
think
that
comes
true
particularly
here.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
the
right
to
a
subpoena
is
absolute,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
i
not
only
think
that
--
is
i
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
that
it
would
be.
i
think
that
compulsory
process,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
compulsory
process
means
just
what
it
said
and
it
cannot
be
conditioned
upon
explaining
the
relevancy
of
the
testimony
of
the
witness.
in
this
particular
case,
the
relevancy
was
very
obvious
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct.
he
was
in
the
moore's
apartment
immediately
after
the
homicide.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
none
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
now
i
want
very
much
to
get
to
the
procedural
issue
that
your
honor
specifically
certified.
but
before
doing
so,
i
must
say
a
few
words
about
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
because
the
evidence
that
we
talked
about
here
was
conclusive
in
my
opinion
on
the
question
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
crime.
at
the
very
least,
it
certainly
raised
a
very
serious
question
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
crime
and
yet
the
state
admittedly
did
not
put
on
one
word
of
evidence
on
that
issue
and
we
believe
that
the
combination
of
those
factors
plus
the
denial
of
the
--
by
the
--
by
the
court
of
the
right
to
put
on
further
expert
evidence
on
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
clearly
denied
the
defendant
of
due
process.
and
we
think
that
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
obviously
cognizable
in
habeas
corpus.
i
think
this
court
must
hold
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
to
convict
the
man
for
acts
committed
while
he
is
insane.
i
do
not
contend
that
this
court
has
specifically
so
held
but
certainly,
the
statement
by
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
in
the
baldi
case
is
a
statement
that
the
majority
apparently
would
have
adhered
to
in
that
case
in
a
statement
which
i
think
this
court
would
adhere
to
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
ever
since
our
ancestral
common
law
emerged
of
the
darkness
of
its
early
barbaric
days,
it
has
been
a
password
of
western
civilization
that
the
taking
of
life
by
the
hand
of
an
insane
person
is
not
murder.
i
think
that
is
clearly
so.
i
think
that
as
the
state
has
conceded,
it
would
not
be
possible
for
the
states
to
deprive
or
to
deny
the
defense
of
insanity
two
state
courts
--
supreme
courts
have
so
held.
and
if
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
constitutionally
protected
defense,
if
you
may
not
convict
the
man
for
x
committed
while
he
was
insane
then
that
question,
the
assertion
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime
raises
federal
constitutional
issues.
it
states
facts
which
are
true
would
entitle
the
petitioner
to
relieve
and
clearly
under
townsend
versus
sain
and
fay
versus
noia,
this
court
necessarily
must
inquire
whereof
that
defense
was
rejected.
and
on
the
record
in
this
case,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
defense
was
rejected
without
inadequate
hearing,
that
the
record
does
not
fairly
support
the
state
court's
finding,
that
there
in
fact
was
not,
after
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
a
reliable
finding
of
the
facts.
this
court
has
never
distinguished
between
collateral
issues
and
issues
which
it
decided
for
defendant
might
be
determinative
and
permitting
--
and
in
canvassing
constitutional
questions.
surely,
this
court
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
his
federal
constitutional
right
by
the
manner
in
which
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
crime
was
--
this
court
is
not
going
to
ignore
that
or
refuse
to
hold
a
plenary
hearing
simply
because
if
in
fact
he
were
found
to
be
insane,
he
would
then
have
to
be
released
rather
than
given
a
new
trial.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
absolutely
correct
in
holding
as
it
did
on
this
record
that
a
plenary
hearing
on
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
was
mandatory.
i
also
believe,
however,
that
on
the
face
of
the
record,
there
was
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
with
respect
to
the
way
in
which
this
issue
was
handled
which
in
it
of
itself
would
require
the
court
to
issue
a
writ
without
holding
the
plenary
hearing.
and
therefore,
we
get
to
the
question
of
what
the
further
or
where
the
further
hearing
should
be
held.
now
if
there
is
to
be
a
plenary
hearing
on
either
of
the
issue
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
crime
or
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial,
a
plenary
hearing
on
those
issues
must
be
held
in
the
district
court.
this
court
has
no
power
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
on
habeas
corpus.
its
only
power
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant
have
been
violated
and
if
it
finds
that
they
have
been
violated,
it
must
issue
the
writ.
in
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
in
jackson
versus
denno,
this
court
found
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process,
found
that
the
new
york
procedure
for
handling
the
issue
of
voluntariness
of
a
confession
was
inadequate,
did
not
meet
constitutional
standards
and
therefore
issued
the
writ,
but
they
held
that
new
york
rather
than
giving
him
a
full
new
trial,
would
only
have
to
give
him
a
limited
hearing
on
the
voluntariness
of
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
the
diff
--
if
the
court
please,
i
contend
that
for
two
reasons,
this
kind
of
an
order
would
be
inappropriate
in
the
present
case.
there
were
two
considerations.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
it
is
inappropriate.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no
indeed.
i
only
say
that
you
may
not
remand
without
issuing
the
writ.
that
you
may
not
do.
once
you
issue
the
writ,
you
may
order
a
limited
hearing
in
the
state
court
under
jackson
or
a
full
new
trial.
now
i
have
a
serious
question
about
jackson.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
you
issued
the
writ
in
jackson.
but
jackson
was
a
very
peculiar
case
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
the
considerations
of
federalism
which
moved
this
court
in
jackson
are
simply
not
here.
in
jackson,
you
will
recall
that
this
court
have
upset
a
long
standing
new
york
procedure
which
really
had
been
in
past
decisions
to
some
extent
approved
by
this
court.
and
the
new
york
court,
the
evidence
in
that
case
showed
had
thought
that
it
was
doing
exactly
what
it
ought
to
do
but
this
court
found
that
its
procedure
was
inadequate
and
therefore
having
in
mind
the
delicate
relationship
between
the
state
and
federal
courts,
this
court
felt
that
it
was
only
fair
to
allow
the
new
york
court
to
decide
this
issue
using
proper
procedures
the
first
time.
they
had
never
decided
whether
this
confession
was
voluntary.
they
had
not
known
that
their
procedures
were
inadequate.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
limited
hearing
on
--
on
one
of
these
questions,
the
thing
that
makes
the
district
court
better
is
this
that
in
the
state
--
the
state
courts
have
already,
the
state
court
of
illinois
has
already
considered
this
issue
and
ruled
upon
it.
the
state
court,
the
trial
court
apparently
was
unable
to
find
any
reason
to
hold
the
hearing
on
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial.
it
was
apparently
unable
to
find
any
reason
to
question
his
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
the
state
supreme
court
have
those
issues
raised
on
direct
appeal
now.
if
you
send
this
case
back
to
the
state
court
for
a
limited
hearing,
i
submit
that
you
cannot
possibly
give
mr.
robinson
the
full
and
fair
hearing
that
he
is
entitled
to.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that's
correct,
a
full
new
trial.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well
your
honor,
the
reason
--
there
--
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
as
a
practical
matter
if
a
plenary
hearing
is
all
--
in
the
district
court
is
all
that
is
required,
that,
it
would
be
on
the
basis
of
a
holding
that
the
record
does
not
show
on
its
face
of
violation
of
due
process
but
simply
that
it
shows
under
the
six
situations
outlined
in
townsend
versus
sain
that
a
mandatory
plenary
hearing
is
required
to
determine
if
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
so
at
that
point
in
time,
the
defendant
does
not
have
any
--
mr.
robinson
does
not
have
any
right
in
effect
to
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
it's
going
to
be
limited.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
do
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
what
i
think
should
be
done.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct.
to
give
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
--
him
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct.
but
i
am
further
addressing
myself
specifically
to
the
state's
contention
that
if
[inaudible]
in
terms
of
remand
but
i'm
sure
they
would
agree.
it
would
have
to
be
situation
where
the
writ
issued
but
if
the
writ
issues,
the
condition
of
the
writ
should
be
a
limited
hearing
rather
than
a
new
trial.
i
submit
that
you
cannot
give
mr.
robinson
his
full
rights
by
giving
him
a
limited
hearing
in
the
state
court
at
this
stage
of
the
game
because
the
state
court
has
already
considered
these
issues.
now
there's
--
pardon
me.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that's
correct.
because
mr.
justice
white,
in
rogers
versus
richmond,
this
court
pointed
out
that
if
there
has
been
a
what
i
have
called
in
my
brief
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process,
if
the
procedure
is
used
in
the
trial
court
were
not
adequate
to
afford
a
fair
trial
to
the
defendant
then
he
is
entitled
to
having
been
denied
due
process
in
his
trial,
he
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
now
in
jackson
versus
denno
where
the
issue
was
simply
whether
or
not
it
was
to
be
determined
according
to
this
court's
formulation
by
the
trial
judge
himself
and
it
was
the
narrow
issue
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
the
court
found
no
objection
in
view
of
the
exigencies
of
federalism,
found
no
objection
to
giving
him
a
limited
hearing.
i
have
serious
questions
whether
that
was
alright
even
in
jackson,
but
in
this
case,
if
you're
trying
to
give
mr.
robinson
a
limited
hearing
in
the
state
court
on
the
question
of
his
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
you
are
then
giving
him
a
hearing
which
is
totally
unknown
to
illinois
law,
on
an
issue
which
is
always
tried
with
the
case
on
its
merits,
an
issue
in
which
the
ability
for
example
to
cross-examine
the
state's
current
witnesses
maybe
very
important
and
yet
if
it
is
a
limited
trial,
there
won't
be
any
concurrent
witnesses
there.
an
issue
incidentally
in
which
the
state
court
in
a
full
trial,
the
jury
in
a
full
trial
might
very
well
find
something
less
than
legal
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
but
something
sufficient
to
reduce
the
events
under
illinois
law
to
voluntary
man
slaughter.
so
you
cannot
separate
that
out
in
the
state
court
and
say
that
you're
giving
robinson
a
fair
trial
that
he
was
previously
denied
by
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that's
another
problem
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
don't
think
that
is
sufficient
clearly
if
you
find
a
violation
of
due
process
in
handling
the
issue
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial,
a
full
new
trial
is
required
because
the
limited
issue
on
sanity
to
be
held
now
on
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
1959
would
not
be
the
same
proceeding.
that
is
an
entirely
different
proceeding
to
determine
a
concurrent
state
of
facts
that
jury
observes
the
defendant,
psychiatrist
are
made
available
to
testify
on
the
basis
of
concurrent
examination
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
would
be
very
important.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
you
can't,
that's
my
point
your
honor.
you
cannot
and
therefore
he
must.
if
the
writ
is
issued,
he
must
have
a
full
trial
and
now
they've
been,
they
can
determine
his
competency
as
of
today
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
should
be
put
to
trial.
mr.
robinson
was
denied
due
process
in
his
trial
seven
years
ago.
now
he's
been
in
jail
as
a
result
of
that
denial
for
seven
years
and
i
submit
that
he
should
have
a
complete
and
full
and
fair
trial
the
second
time
around
not
a
piecemeal
limited
hearing
on
an
issue
in
which
the
trial
court
judge
is
necessarily
going
to
be
influenced.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
so
far
as
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
is
concerned,
very
frankly,
it
is
my
position
that
the
remand
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
ask
the
district
court
to
determine
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
it
asked
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
due
process
was
violated
by
the
failure
to
afford
a
sanity
hearing
and
i
presume
that
the
questions
that
they
may
have
had
in
mind
were
questions
involving
possibility
of
waiver
or
what
the
evidence
might
be.
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
that
this
was
clearly
erroneous.
i
think
they
have
to
hold
on
the
record
that
a
sanity
hearing
was
required
and
that
--
and
issue
the
writ
and
then
of
course
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem
because
you
would
be
back
on
the
state
court
and
applying
states
standards.
i
--
may
i
continue
your
honor?
mr.
john
c.
tucker
to
finish
the
question?
mr.
john
c.
tucker
on
the
--
on
the
issue
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
federal
district
court
would
necessarily
apply
federal
standards
in
determining
that.
i
don't
know
however
but
there
are
federal
standards
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes,
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
know
whether
that
has
been
sufficiently
formulated
but
i
think
that
the
standards
of
the
durham
test
would
be
probably
for
federal
standards.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
i
would
--
i
would
not
force
you
into
that
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
possibly
some
sort
of
the
consensus
of
the
state
standards
in
a
case
of
this
nature
would
be
appropriate
also.
i
really
haven't
formulated
that.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
mcnaughton
plus
irresistible
impulse
and
some
people
believe
since
the
new
criminal
code
that
it's
almost
a
durham
test
but
that
hasn't
right
now
been
entirely
decided.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
a
hearing
on
his
competency
to
stand
trial
and
a
full
and
fair
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that's
correct
but
he
was
never
given
a
sanity
hearing
under
illinois
law.
the
procedure
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
he
was
denied
a
fair
hearing
on
his
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial.
he
was
denied
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
he
was
denied
any
hearing
on
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial
because
under
illinois
law,
the
only
way
that
issue
was
canvassed
is
by
a
jury.
the
judge
has
no
--
no
right
to
hear
that
issue.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
if
the
judge
tries
it
without
a
jury,
he
is
denied
--
the
defendant
is
denied
procedural
due
process
because
he
has
been
denied
the
illinois
procedure
and
you
can't
therefore
tell
what
the
judge
has
done.
the
illinois
court,
this
illinois
supreme
court
clearly
holds
that
if
--
that
to
deny
a
defendant
a
sanity
hearing
under
illinois
law
where
the
evidence
requires
it
is
to
deny
him
procedural
due
process.
but
please
don't
make
me
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct.
that
is
my
position
together
with
the
fact
that
there
is
no
other
way
that
he
could
have
a
hearing
that
there
was
no
hearing
in
this
case
and
secondly,
and
thirdly,
i
should
say,
i
believe
that
even
if
you
wanted
to
apply
some
generalized
federal
standard
that
i
--
i
don't
know
exists
but
even
under
any
theory
by
the
way
in
which
this
issue
was
handled
by
denying
him
an
opportunity
to
have
the
testimony
of
witnesses
who
were
crucial
to
this
issue,
he
was
denied
a
fair
hearing
under
any
standard
but
my
first
position
is
that
by
denying
him
the
illinois
procedure,
he
was
denied
procedural
due
process
because
this
is
a
constitutional
question,
constitutional
issue
in
which
the
states
must
provide
a
procedure
for
canvassing
the
question
and
if
they
provide
it
but
they
don't
afford
it
to
a
particular
defendant
then
they
have
denied
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that's
correct.
and
they
have
denied
him
procedural
due
process.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that's
correct.
if
the
due
process
clause
requires
it
so
that
it
would
be
adequately
canvassed
and
illinois
provides
the
method
for
canvassing
and
if
they
deny
it
to
a
particular
defendant
where
under
their
standards
its
required
then
they
have
denied
him
procedural
due
process.
and
it
also
--
well,
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
the
web
of
equal
protection
if
i
can
avoid
it
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
means
that
one
of
the
issues
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial
and
that
is
not
the
first
time
it
came
up.
it
was
raised
throughout
the
trial
by
the
evidence
and
by
the
questions
asked
by
defense
counsel
of
--
of
his
witnesses
and
recognized
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
the
court
effectively
barred
it
by
denying
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
it
by
denying
continuances
of
less
than
two
hours
or
less
than
half
a
day
to
obtain
psychiatric
witness
by
failing
to
issue
a
subpoena
for
the
moores
who
would
observe
him
at
a
relevant
time
and
could
have
testified
as
to
his
conduct
and
by
failing
to
grant
a
continuance
to
have
dr.
haines
called
as
a
live
witness.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
certainly
one
aspect
of
it
and
one
of
the
very
large
aspects
of
it.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
say
that
the
record
on
its
face
with
res
--
with
respect
to
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
shows
the
evidence
that
was
presented,
was
sufficient
to
require
the
invoking
of
the
illinois
procedure
to
canvass
the
issue
and
that
by
under
those
circumstances,
the
evidence
that
was
presented
was
sufficient
to
require
invoking
that
particular
and
the
failure
to
invoke
it,
therefore,
denied
him
due
process
because
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
where
--
that
--
that
the
issue
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial
be
determined
if
it
is
raised
and
illinois
provides
only
one
procedure
for
determining
it
and
that's
to
convene
a
jury.
and
when
they
didn't
convene
a
jury
in
this
case,
when
they
did
not
apply
their
own
procedures
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
evidence
in
the
record,
they
denied
him
due
process.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
don't
believe
that
it
does
your
honor
but
i
do
believe
that
if
the
--
if
the
state
formulates
a
method
of
determining
a
constitutional
issue
and
makes
that
its
sole
method
of
determining
it
and
itself
takes
away
from
the
judge
the
right
to
determine
it
then
they've
got
to
afford
that
procedure
to
everybody.
now
i
don't
say
that
they
couldn't
change
that
law.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
it
maybe
equal
protection
your
honor
but
it's
equal
protection
in
the
sense
that
equal
protection
and
due
process
came
from
the
same
source
and
this
being
in
a
judicial
proceeding,
i
prefer
to
call
it
due
process
and
as
i
said,
it
maybe
the
equal
protection
also.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
correct.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well
i
have
a
very
quick
answer
to
that.
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
at
all
but
i'm
sure
that's
not
the
answer
that
you
want.
the
answer
is
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
because
--
because
in
the
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case,
they
set
forth
the
illinois
law
in
this
regard
insofar
as
the
legal
statement
is
concerned.
they
set
it
forth
correctly
and
i
--
i
don't
have
that
before
me
but
the
illinois
--
the
illinois
law
is
as
i
stated
--
the
supreme
court
said,
there
wasn't
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
would
raise
the
issue
because
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
mental
condition
that
caused
him
to
be
committed
to
the
kankakee
hospital
was
of
a
continuing
or
enduring
nature
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
specifically
said,
that
finding
completely
overlooks
about
three-quarters
of
the
evidence
in
this
record.
and
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
if
i
may
say
so,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
--
is
not
let's
say
known
to
go
off
too
far
in
cases
of
this
nature.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
quite
sarcastic
about
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
they
couldn't
find
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
would
raise
the
issue
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial
or
sanity
at
the
time
of
crime.
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
