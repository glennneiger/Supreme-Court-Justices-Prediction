justice

how
long
that
he'd
been
in
the
institution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
bishop
held
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
you
say
bishop
held
that,
i
have
it
before
me?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
didn't
say
anything
about
the
constitutional
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
not
have
been
on
supervisory
power
or
something
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
joining
issue
with
your
own
fact
as
to
whether
that
is
the
rule
or
should
be
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
any
other
case
besides
the
bishop
case
that
you
say
it
held
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
dissented
in
one
or
two.
the
court
indicated
the
other
direction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
read
that
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
ever
held
that
a
man
can
be
tried
in
absence,
fits
into
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
a
vague
recollection.
[inaudible]
somebody
went
to
[inaudible]
and
something
was
done
there
and
maybe
he
was
inside
and
come
to
him
but
some
kind
of
penalty
was
imposed
on
him
by
the
time
he
escaped
taxes.
you
don't
--
you
haven't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
blackman
i
believe
was
the
name.
blackman
or
black
--
may
be
i'll
get
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
last
speech
made
by
the
lawyer
for
the
defendant
said
that
was
one
of
the
issues
before
him,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
hearing
under
illinois
law.
what
was
he
denied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
what
procedure
was
he
denied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
the
judge
tries
without
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
get
on
to
this
on
that
because
that
haven't
been
wholly
clear
that
illinois
law
provides
to
the
man
in
the
court
to
be
entitled
to
have
a
separate
trial
on
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
if
he
has
been
denied
due
process
because
he
was
not
given
that
time
of
hearing.
justice
hugo

procedure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
due
process
clause
requires
that
he'd
be
given
a
separate
procedure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
this
statement
come
up?
was
it
the
first
time
it
has
been
mentioned?

mr.
mcdermott,
your
honor
i
should
like
to
say
that
i
think
that
our
defense
is
clear
that
we
have
presented
at
the
present
time.
it
is
as
to
the
sanity
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
also
as
to
the
present
time.
so
what
does
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
court
--
did
the
court
bar
any
of
the
evidence
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
comes
down
in
that
part
of
it,
you
are
saying
he
was
denied
due
process
because
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
get
his
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what's
the
other
one?
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
that
the
federal
constitution
barred
the
state
from
letting
the
judge
determine
it
rather
than
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
equal
protection,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
court
tried
the
issue
of
his
sanity
during
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
was
meant
by
the
statement
of
the
lawyer
here
that
the
two
issues
were
as
he
said
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
conduct
charged,
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
162.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
judge
is
trying
a
man
without
a
jury,
if
some
question
is
raised
about
insanity,
he
would
want
to
know
something
about
it,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
before
him
but
that's
--
that's
why
i
ask
if
he
tried
that
--
to
determine
that
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
the
counsel
told
him
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
denied
by
the
state?
