mr.
richard
a.
michael
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
the
respondent
brought
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
he
contended
that
his
confinement
pursuant
to
his
life
sentence
for
murder
of
flossie
may
ward
resulted
in
non-constitutional
confinement.
the
district
court
after
a
study
of
the
record
of
his
trial
in
the
state
court
dismissed
the
petition.
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
that
court
in
a
two
to
one
decision
reversed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
remanded
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
two
issues.
first,
whether
the
respondent
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
secondly,
whether
the
trial
judge
had
denied
the
respondent
due
process
by
his
failure
on
its
own
motion
to
impanel
insanity
jury
to
determine
the
question
of
the
respondent's
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial.
the
issues
presented
to
this
court
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
at
the
time
of
trial
your
honor?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes.
if
the
question
is
raised,
it
is
the
duty
to
impanel
a
jury
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
would
be,
i
assume
so,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
for
this
jury
--
for
this
court
to
determine
then
whether
the
question
of
the
sanity
of
the
--
of
a
person
or
the
accused
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
cognizable
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
taken
from
a
state
conviction.
and
secondly,
whether
with
respect
to
the
question
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
trial,
this
was
waived
by
the
respondent's
failure
to
raise
that
issue
in
the
trial
court
or
if
not
whether
the
record
on
its
face
does
not
affirmatively
show
that
he
was
not
denied
due
process
by
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
on
its
own
motion
to
impanel
a
sanity
jury.
finally,
there
is
the
issue
submitted
by
this
court
for
consideration
whether
if
either
or
both
of
the
hearing
specified
in
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
held
--
that
should
be
held
in
the
state
or
in
the
federal
court.
the
record
before
the
district
court
in
the
determination
of
the
--
of
these
issues
was
the
transcript
of
the
respondent's
trial
in
the
state
court.
that
transcript
shows
that
the
respondent
was
tried
by
daniel
--
by
judge
daniel
gazelli
of
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county.
he
waived
trial
by
jury
and
submitted
himself
to
a
bench
trial.
the
state
introduced
evidence
which
showed
that
the
victim,
flossie
may
ward
and
the
respondent,
were
living
together
in
a
common-law
status.
the
victim
worked
at
collins
barbeque
house
in
the
south
side
of
chicago.
there,
the
respondent
would
frequently
go
for
his
meals
and
to
pick
her
up
when
she
was
through
working
for
the
day.
she
worked
the
shift
from
about
10
in
the
evening
to
about
five
in
the
morning.
on
the
night
of
the
murder
in
question,
february
28,
1959,
the
respondent
entered
the
collins
barbeque
house.
on
duty
there
besides
the
victim
were
another
waitress,
natty
bates
and
a
cook
by
the
name
of
jim
hatten.
the
respondent
jumped
over
the
--
the
victim
saw
the
respondent
and
said,
“ted,
don't
start
anything
tonight”
or
words
to
that
effect,
obviously
showing
there
had
been
some
battle
going
on
between
them.
nevertheless,
he
jumped
over
the
counter.
the
cook
and
the
waitress
saw
a
revolver
in
his
hand.
it
was
pointed
at
the
victim.
they
heard
two
shots.
the
victim
ran
off
the
door
--
jumped
over
the
counter
and
run
off
the
door.
the
respondent
jumped
over
the
counter
and
run
off
the
door
after
her.
subsequently,
her
--
her
body
was
found
in
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
restaurant
dead,
and
cause
of
death
was
proven
to
be
a
gunshot
wound
in
the
head.
the
next
day,
robert
moore
came
to
the
department
of
officer
starr.
moore
had
an
apartment
in
the
same
complex
with
starr.
he
told
him
that
he
has
been
informed
by
a
telephone
call
that
robinson
was
wanted
for
murder
and
that
he
was
presently
in
his
apartment
and
would
the
officer
please
came
up
and
arrest
him.
officer
starr
called
for
additional
help
with
two
additional
policemen
and
they
went
up
to
the
moore
apartment.
they
rang
the
bell,
talked
for
about
two
minutes
with
mrs.
moore.
she
informed
them
that
robinson
had
just
left.
they
then
realized
that
a
man
whom
they
had
first
seen
when
they
got
off
the
elevator
standing
in
the
corridor
was
robinson.
they
went
over
and
asked
him
his
name
and
he
admitted
that
he
was
and
he
was
arrested
and
taken
into
custody.
about
an
hour
and
a
half
later,
officer
starr,
accompanied
with
another
policeman,
went
back
to
the
moore
apartment.
there
they
found
in
the
closet
a
hat
and
a
coat
that
matched
completely
with
the
hat
and
coat
that
robinson
was
described
had
been
wearing
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
in
the
pocket
was
found
a
revolver
which
was
subsequently
proven
to
be
the
murder
weapon.
the
respondent
admitted
that
the
hat
and
coat
were
his
but
denied
the
ownership
of
the
revolver.
after
the
state
proved
its
case
in
this
manner,
the
defendant
presented
his
case.
the
defendant
was
represented
by
two
appointed
counsel,
mr.
warren
carey
and
mr.
mcdermott
of
the
chicago
bar.
mr.
carey
was
an
experienced
criminal
attorney
and
had
taught
criminal
law
prior
to
this
time
at
the
depaul
university.
the
def
--
the
respondent's
defense
did
not
in
anyway
contest
or
refute
the
facts
proven
by
the
state
but
rather
attempted
to
raise
the
defense
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
the
evidence
introduced
in
this
respect
tended
to
show.
there
was
testimony
by
his
mother
that
when
he
was
seven
or
eight
years
old,
a
brick
that
was
dropped
from
a
third
floor
hit
him
on
the
head
and
that
thereafter
he
was
cross-eyed,
complained
of
headaches,
and
acted
a
little
peculiar.
nobody
testified
however
to
any
unusual
incidents
that
occurred
until
he
went
into
the
army.
once
one
time
when
he
was
home
on
furlough
while
he
was
in
the
army,
both
his
mother
and
a
friend
of
the
family
testified
that
he
was
having
dinner
with
a
girlfriend,
his
mother
prepared
dinner
for
them.
they
were
sitting
in
the
front
room
talking
after
the
dinner.
the
mother
--
he
asked
the
mother
for
some
money
and
the
mother
denied
it
to
him
and
he
kicked
a
hole
in
the
bar
in
the
front
room.
he
later
went
back
into
the
army.
he
was
discharged
to
--
for
all
the
record
shows
in
normal
course
of
the
events.
after
he
was
released
from
the
army
it
appears
he
worked
with
his
grandfather,
mr.
ed
langham
as
it
is
his
profession
as
a
painter.
mr.
langham
testified
that
on
some
occasions
during
this
time,
he
would
seem
to
be
in
the
daze,
walk
off
the
job
without
saying
anything
to
anybody,
come
back
about
two
or
three
hours
later
in
seemingly
normal
condition.
during
this
period,
there
was
also
a
testimony
that
he
seemed
to
have
a
glare
in
his
eye
and
deep
--
be
in
deep
study.
in
1952,
he
went
to
the
home
of
his
aunt,
mrs.
calhoun
and
asked
her
--
told
her
that
people
were
trying
to
kill
him.
she
called
up
his
mother,
his
mother
came.
he
fought
against
letting
his
mother
in
the
apartment.
then
then
he
fought
against
his
mother
and
his
aunt
looked
at
them
and
according
to
that
testimony,
he
had
a
starey
look
in
his
eye
and
seemed
to
be
a
bit
foamy
in
the
mouth.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
on
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
before
--
well
before
the
judge.
he
waived
trial
by
jury
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
--
and
collected
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that's
right
your
honor.
the
aunt
and
the
mother
called
the
police
and
he
fought
to
keep
them
from
entering
the
apartment.
when
they
did,
they
took
him
into
custody,
took
him
to
hines
hospital.
he
was
later
sent
to
county
hospital
and
finally
committed
to
kankakee
state
hospital,
a
state
mental
institution.
subsequently,
he
was
released
from
that
hospital
about
six
months
later
as
cured
by
the
hospital.
there
was
a
hospital
report
that
is
in
the
record
that
was
issued
at
this
time
which
describes
all
the
typical
symptoms
of
delirium
tremens.
about
–
after
he
was
released,
he
seemed
to
either
difficult
--
getting
difficulty
with
his
wife.
there
is
a
testimony
in
the
record
by
mr.
langham
that
in
one
occasion,
the
respondent
got
into
a
serious
fight
with
his
wife
and
took
her
clothes
off
in
the
backyard
and
purported
to
burn
them.
in
1953,
however,
his
wife
left
him.
this
seemed
to
disturb
him
greatly.
he
shot
himself
--
he
shot
his
young
child
and
then
attempted
to
commit
suicide
first
by
shooting
himself
and
then
by
jumping
into
a
lagoon.
when
neither
of
these
attempts
failed,
he
went
to
a
policeman
and
surrendered.
he
was
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
for
the
murder
of
his
child.
after
he
was
released
from
custody,
no
unusual
incidents
appeared
to
have
occurred
except
that
in
one
occasion,
his
mother
had
a
warrant
sworn
for
him
because
he
seemed
to
be
fighting
too
so
much.
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
the
four
witnesses
who
testified
in
the
respondent's
behalf,
his
mother,
miss
peterson,
his
aunt,
mrs.
calhoun,
his
grandfather,
mr.
langham,
and
a
friend
of
the
family
by
the
name
of
alice
moore
who
has
no
relation
to
the
moore's,
near
whose
apartment
he
was
arrested,
testified
that
they
believe
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
indicated
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
the
crime
was
unable
to
distinguish
between
right
and
wrong
with
respect
to
the
conduct
in
question.
in
rebuttal,
the
state
introduced
the
stipulated
testimony
of
dr.
haines,
the
chief
of
the
behavior
--
the
psychiatrist
who
is
chief
of
the
behavior
institute
of
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county.
dr.
haines'
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
he
had
examined
robinson
two
months
before
the
trial
and
that
his
--
in
his
opinion,
robinson
was
able
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
aid
of
his
own
defense.
on
the
basis
of
this
testimony,
the
judge
as
the
trier
of
the
fact,
found
the
respondent
guilty.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
only
what
can
be
inferred
from
the
testimony
of
dr.
haines
your
honor
which
of
course
directly
relates
to
his
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
it
is
at
least
stated
in
the
test
of
the
--
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
oh
yes,
your
honor,
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
trial,
the
test
is
whether
you
are
insane
at
the
--
whether
you
are
able
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
you
and
aid
your
own
defense.
this
is
to
be
determined
by
the
insanity
jury
if
it
is
--
if
it
is
empaneled
for
that
purpose.
the
defense
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
we
use
the
mcnaughton
plus
the
irresistible
impulse
test
which
is
determined
by
the
trier
of
fact
whatever
that
maybe
in
respect
to
the
--
to
the
case.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
--
well
maybe
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
--
he
is
institutionalized
until
he
either
regain
insanity.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
right
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he's
acquitted
and
that's
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
don't
think
there
is
any
required
institutionalization
in
that
regard.
i
think,
however,
that
it
can
trigger
institutionalizing
procedures.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
right
your
honor.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
there
were
two
colloquies
between
the
defendant
and
--
and
the
court.
these
colloquies
first
occurred
after
the
state
closed
its
case
related
to
the
calling
of
certain
witnesses.
the
second
related
after
the
case
--
occurred
after
he
had
been
sentenced
and
objected
to
quite
certain
witnesses
had
not
been
called
in
his
behalf.
both
of
these
colloquies
we
submit
chose
the
ability
--
show
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
to
aid
in
his
own
behalf.
they
are
referred
in
full
in
our
statement
of
facts
and
we
submit
them
to
the
court's
attention.
turning
then
to
the
first
issue,
whether
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
cognizable
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
after
the
state
conviction.
we
contend
that
it
is
not.
we
contend
like
this,
like
any
other
affirmative
defense
to
the
charge
of
crime
--
of
criminal
activity
as
a
matter
for
determination
by
the
trier
of
fact
and
that
that
should
be
conclusive.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
was
denied
the
procedural
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
you
mean
by
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well
of
course
your
honor,
if
there
was
a
violation
of
--
of
one
--
of
a
right
guaranteed
by
the
constitution,
of
course
that
is
cognizable.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
not
your
honor.
there
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
--
if
there
is
a
--
found
to
be
a
violation
of
what
this
court
has
held
to
be
procedural
due
process,
clearly,
the
--
it
is
within
the
scope
of
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
your
honor
remanded
the
case
rehearing
of
two
issues.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
that
is
--
that
is
my
contention
your
honor.
we
contend
that
this
issue
is
not
so
reviewable.
we
believe
that
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
ruled
on
this
issue
other
than
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
has
so
held
different.
there
have
been
five
court
of
appeals
in
all
that
have
so
held.
furthermore,
we
contend
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
is
cognizable
is
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
leland
versus
oregon
and
bishop
versus
united
states.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
as
a
defense
constituted
the
entire
defense
asserted
by
the
defendant
to
the
charge
of
criminal
activity
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
the
testimony
of
the
four
lay
witnesses
who
testified
in
the
defendant's
behalf
and
it
was
the
stipulated
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist
in
behalf
of
the
state.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
your
honor,
i
will
refer
you
to
the
record
first
to
page
30.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
this
is
not
related
to
moore
your
honor.
about
a
third
way
down
the
page
your
honor,
we
have
his
counsel
mr.
mcdermott.
could
we
have
a
call
of
the
witnesses
at
this
time
to
see
if
capias
would
have
to
be
issued
or
not?
there
was
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
issued
to
dr.
kelleher,
chicago
psychiatric
institute
and
as
yet
we
have
heard
no
response
for
him.
i
think
i
will
call
the
court
call
him.
mr.
mcdermott.
mr.
warren
carey
asked
me
to
prepare
a
petition
for
a
capias.
the
court,
alright
prepare
a
petition
for
a
capias.
thank
you
very
much.
i
then
call
your
attention
to
the
record,
page
147.
starting
about
the
second
half
of
the
page
your
honor,
again,
his
attorney
mr.
mcdermott
says,
your
honor,
there
is
also
a
doctor
from
the
psychiatric
institute
that
we've
been
trying
to
get
in
contact
with
and
we
do
feel
certain
we
can
reach
him
by
the
morning.
we
have
hopes
of
reaching
him
and
having
him
here
this
afternoon.
i
assume
that's
the
same
doctor
from
the
psychiatric
institute
they
were
talking
about
before,
dr.
kelleher.
when
did
you
reach
him?
prior
to
july
we
wrote,
we
received
a
letter
from
the
institute
in
july
and
had
conversations
at
that
time.
the
court:
the
institute
of
illinois?
mr.
mcdermott:
yes,
it
is
down
at
elevenson
state
street.
the
court:
did
you
subpoena
him?
they'll
interrupt
in
consequence
of
the
court.
did
you
subpoena
him?
mr.
mcdermott:
i
understand
it
was
done
but
i'm
not
really
sure.
the
court:
if
you
subpoenaed
him,
i
wish
you
an
attachment.
if
you
did
not
subpoena
him,
we
cannot
delay
the
trial.
you
must
prepare
your
lawsuit
before
you
go
to
trial
and
not
during
the
trial.
you
are
now
on
trial
for
two
days,
etcetera.
i
finally
call
your
attention
to
--
he
said
--
finally,
he
said,
we
are
in
trial
for
two
days
and
the
cases
are
pending.
we
have
to
proceed.
if
you
subpoena
him,
prepare
a
petition
that
i
will
send
for
him.
if
you
did
not
subpoena
him,
it
is
unfortunate.
finally,
i
draw
your
attention
your
honor
to
page
167
of
the
record.
there
we
have
a
statement
by
the
respondent's
counsel
at
the
close
of
the
case.
the
respondent
said,
“i
would
like
to
--
the
record
to
show
your
honor
that
i
personally
spent
much
time
including
perhaps
two
or
three
dozen
telephone
calls
to
psychiatrists
that
i
have
contacted
the
illinois
psychiatric
society
and
all
of
its
officers,
requesting
assistance
in
this
matter.
i
have
asked
dr.
[inaudible]
in
michigan
boulevard.
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
an
analyst
to
cooperate
and
work
on
this
matter.
i
do
not
believe
in
subpoenaing
a
psychiatrist
to
testify
when
i
do
not
know
his
degree
of
cooperativeness
that
he
would
display
in
behalf
of
the
court.”
that
is
the
total
record
on
his
attempts
to
attempt
--
to
obtain
a
psychiatrist.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
we
contend
that
the
issue
that
the
--
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
--
that
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit,
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
crime
is
cognizable
on
federal
habeas
corpus
is
contrary
with
the
decision
of
the
five
courts
of
appeal
that
ruled
in
the
case
and
the
decision
of
this
case
and
leland
versus
oregon
and
bishop
versus
united
states.
in
leland
versus
oregon,
there
was
a
murder
conviction
in
which
the
individual
tried
to
assert
the
defense
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
his
--
his
defense
was
disallowed
and
his
conviction
was
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
of
oregon.
in
this
court,
he
contended
that
he
was
denied
due
process
by
the
rule
that
--
of
oregon
that
a
person
who
attempts
to
raise
the
defense
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
proven
beyond
reasonable
doubt
and
by
the
rule
of
oregon
that
applied
as
a
test
for
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
the
mcnaughton
test
with
no
additional
tests
or
factors.
this
court
held
that
this
was
not
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
that
a
state
could
apply
any
test
--
properly
--
proper
test
desired
for
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof
thereon.
if
this
court
of
appeals
was
correct
and
the
issue
was
cognizable
and
had
a
review
of
the
state
conviction,
of
course
there
would
have
to
be
a
federal
test
that
would
be
applied
to
determine
whether
the
state
properly
ruled
on
the
question.
there
would
have
to
be
some
federal
test
that
could
be
applied.
the
decision
in
leland
versus
oregon
that
there
is
no
such
federal
test,
i
submit,
is
therefore
inconsistent
with
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
issue
is
cognizable.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
don't
think
i
would
go
that
far
your
honor.
i
would
say
if
they
could
--
if
--
if
--
i
think
that
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
the
position
that
it
might
be
a
violation
of
due
process
to
disallow
them
--
a
defendant
to
raise
the
defense
at
all.
i
suggest
that
that
raises
a
far
different
question
than
when
you
raised
the
--
the
question
properly
and
then
whether
it
is
entitled
to
a
review
of
that
question.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
i
would
not
go
that
far
in
answer
to
--
to
your
question
your
honor.
furthermore,
we
contend
that
it's
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bishop
versus
united
states.
the
bishop
case
was
a
2255
proceeding
by
a
federal
prisoner
to
which
he
alleged
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
one
that
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
was
not
reviewable
in
a
2255
proceeding
and
secondly,
that
there
had
been
an
adequate
hearing
in
the
trial
court
on
his
issue
of
his
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
this
court
in
a
per
curiam
decision
remanded
the
case
for
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
his
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
we
contend
your
honors
that
by
not
reversing
its
decision
on
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
that
this
was
a
sub
silencio
affirmance
of
the
decision
of
the
seventh
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
that
this
issue
was
not
cognizable
under
2255.
of
course
if
it
was
not
cognizable
under
2255,
it
is
not
cognizable
under
2254.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
proper
result
also.
under
the
common
law
tradition,
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
a
defense
because
--
to
the
charge
of
criminal
responsibility
because
it
negates
the
mens
rea
required
for
criminal
responsibility.
just
like
any
other
affirmative
defense
to
the
charge
of
crime,
it
is
a
defense
because
it
negates
one
of
the
essential
elements
for
a
crime,
in
this
case,
the
mens
rea.
while
it
may
seem
on
its
face
that
it
is
a
violation
of
our
concept
to
liberties
to
say
that
a
person
can
be
convicted
for
a
crime
that
he
committed
while
he
was
insane,
it
is
equally
contrary
to
our
concept
of
board
of
liberties
to
say
a
person
can
be
convicted
for
a
crime
of
which
he
was
innocent.
yet
this
court
--
the
federal
court
does
not
review
the
ultimate
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus,
this
is
a
question
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
that
all
the
elements
of
a
crime
had
been
made
out
whether
any
defense
to
one
of
these
elements
has
been
adequately
proven
by
the
defense.
we
contend
that
insanity
at
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
crime
which
is
merely
a
defense
to
one
of
the
elements
of
criminal
responsibility
should
be
treated
no
differently.
it
is
generally
--
it
is
just
merely
one
defense
to
a
charge
of
crime
to
determine
the
nature
of
which
by
the
trier
of
fact
is
conclusive.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
indicated
that
the
decision
had
already
been
determined
to
the
contrary
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
smith
versus
boldie.
we
contend
that
smith
versus
bodie
is
not
so
applicable.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
--
that
is
it
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
they
can
--
if
there
is
some
other
constitutional
infirmity,
of
course,
that
is
cog
--
that
is
cognizable
your
honor.
i
--
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
remanded
the
case
for
a
determination
of
two
issues.
one
of
which
was
a
determination
of
whether
the
individual
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
that
is
--
that
order
we
contend
is
erroneous
because
we
don't
think
that
that
issue
is
cognizable.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
remanded
the
case
your
honor
--
the
hearing
on
two
questions.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
to
have
--
the
district
court
have
a
full
plenary
hearing
on
the
issue
of
whether
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
if
he
was
insane
then
they
would
--
they
would
have
to
set
aside
the
conviction.
i
assume
if
he
was
not,
if
he
was
found
to
be
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
the
conviction
could
stand.
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
seventh
circuit
order.
in
smith
versus
bodie,
one
of
the
subsidiary
issues
was
--
raised
by
the
petitioner,
was
his
contention
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
this
court
said
with
respect
to
that
barely,
we
do
not
have
to
consider
the
issue
because
it
was
adequately
handled
in
the
trial
court
under
brown
versus
allen.
of
course
that
could
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
issue
was
cognizable
in
this
--
but
this
court
didn't
have
to
rule
on
it
because
brown
versus
al
--
allen
at
the
--
the
authority
that
was
then
applicable
to
the
question
of
whether
a
trial
court
would
--
habeas
corpus
will
have
to
have
a
full
plenary
hearing
just
didn't
require
in
this
case.
however,
since
the
issue
was
not
discussed
by
this
court,
we
think
it
more
reasonable
to
interpret
this
decision
as
merely
a
holding
that
there
was
no
need
to
determine
whether
it
was
cognizable
at
all
or
not
since
it
had
been
fully
--
fully
canvassed
in
the
state
court
in
any
event.
we
contend
that
that
is
the
interpretation
that
is
most
likely
especially
in
light
of
the
decision
of
two
courts
of
appeals
which
after
brown
versus
allen
have
held
the
issue
was
not
cognizable
on
habeas
corpus
and
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bishop
versus
united
states
which
came
subsequent
to
the
decision
of
brown
versus
allen.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
--
we
start
of
your
honor
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
sanity.
however,
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
to
adequately
rebut
that
presumption
then
the
question
becomes
one
which
the
prosecution
like
all
of
the
questions
the
prosecution
must
present
must
prove
beyond
reasonable
doubt
under
the
illinois
rule.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now
with
respect
to
the
four
lay
witnesses,
of
course
they
--
they
testified
that
their
--
in
their
opinion,
the
respondent
was
insane
but
because
they
were
lay
witnesses,
they
could
not
give
their
conclusion
alone.
they
were
required
to
state
all
the
facts
in
which
they
predicated
that
opinion.
now
we
believe
that
once
they
testified
to
all
these
facts,
the
trial
judge
then
was
in
a
good
position
as
these
lay
witnesses
to
look
at
these
facts
to
determine
whether
there
was
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
if
there
was
evidence
on
this
fact,
all
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
in
which
they
could
--
the
trial
judge
could
properly
draw
the
conclusion
of
whether
he
was
sane
or
insane.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
know
of
no
such
issue
--
with
no
such
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
not
your
honor.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
illinois
supreme
court
your
honor
held
that
it
was
not
that
the
evidence
was
--
that
none
of
this
was
directly
relevant
and
that
it
was
not
sufficient
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
--
of
--
of
sanity.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
was
--
that
was
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
your
honor.
i
do
not
rest
on
--
on
that
petition
alone.
as
i
answered
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
that
looking
at
the
record
as
a
whole
there,
the
--
there
was
evidence
to
support
the
contention
that
he
was
sane.
all
the
evidence
that
the
--
the
testimony
as
to
his
life
and
behavior
from
which
the
judge
could
as
well
as
the
lay
witnesses
draw
his
own
conclusion.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
there
is
the
behavior
clinic
of
the
--
of
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
of
which
dr.
haines
is
a
member
that
will
upon
request
examine
any
person
and
have
his
testimony.
of
course
in
this
case,
his
testimony
was
contrary
to
that
of
the
interests
of
the
respondent.
so
therefore
--
that
is
why
he
was
called
by
the
state
rather
and
by
the
respondent.
as
far
as
any
other
agency,
i
know
of
none
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
we
therefore
contend
that
on
the
basis
of
both
precedent
and
principle
your
honor,
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
not
cognizable
in
federal
habeas
corpus
and
that
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
remanding
the
issue
for
determination
of
the
question
--
that
question
for
determination
by
the
district
court.
turning
then
to
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
that
issue
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
district
--
the
trial
court
had
failed
--
had
denied
the
petitioner
due
process
by
its
failure
on
its
own
motion,
the
court's
own
motion
to
impanel
insanity
jury
to
consider
the
question
of
his
competence
to
stand
trial.
we
contend
first
that
that
issue
was
waived
by
the
failure
of
the
--
of
the
respondent
to
raise
the
issue
at
his
trial
and
secondly
that
even
if
it
was
not,
the
record
on
its
face
shows
that
there
was
no
such
a
denial
of
due
process.
on
the
issue
of
waiver,
this
respondent
never
raised
the
question
or
his
counsel
never
raised
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
--
at
the
trial,
i
beg
your
pardon.
never
raised
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
trial.
the
issue
for
--
under
illinois
law,
it
is
the
requirement
of
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
to
raise
that
issue
if
they
have
any
question
with
respect
to
it.
the
law
for
federal
waiver
of
a
federal
right
was
established
by
this
court
of
course
in
fay
versus
noia.
stating
the
rule
very
briefly,
you
said
that
you
there
has
to
be
a
deliberate
bypassing
of
the
state's
procedures.
we
contend
that
there
was
such
a
deliberate
bypassing
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
he
did
not
your
honor.
he
did
not
request
a
sanity
hearing
by
the
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
to
stand
trial,
correct
your
honor.
it
was
his
duty
under
illinois
law
to
raise
that
question,
he
did
not
raise
it.
we
therefore
suggest
that
this
is
a
bypassing
of
the
state
procedure.
it
was
a
deliberate
bypassing.
we
contend
that
by
the
fact
that
he
did
raise
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
as
a
defense,
the
question
of
his
insanity
at
the
time
of
trial
must
have
been
present
to
the
mind
of
the
respondent
or
his
counsel
and
his
failure
to
raise
that
issue
clearly
shows
that
the
bypassing
was
deliberate.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
this
court
has
never
so
held.
there
have
been
two
attempts
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
i
can't
cite
the
cases
right
off
and
to
you.
i
think
they
are
in
the
--
the
--
the
respondent's
brief
in
which
states
have
attempted
to
do
away
with
the
defense
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
on
both
occasions,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
question
held
that
that
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
this
court
has
never
directly
held
on
that
issue
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
the
court
has
held
you
cannot
execute
an
insane
but
i
--
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
has
never
been
a
holding
on
that
point
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well
your
honor,
as
you
know
--
we
did
raise
that
as
a
possible
question
for
this
court
to
consider
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
upon
further
study
of
the
question
and
more
analysis
of
the
question.
we
were
convinced
your
honor
that
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
--
of
due
process
of
our
concept
to
afford
liberties
to
require
a
man
to
stand
on
trial
when
he
is
insane.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
that
issue
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well,
both
deliberate
bypass
and
that
the
record
on
its
face
answers
the
question
submitted
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
--
that
there
was
not
a
denial
of
due
process
in
the
states.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
that
that
is
the
usual
formulation
of
the
test
your
honor
and
i
think
that
it
is
an
appropriate
formulation.
a
person
can
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
it
is
the
formulation
that
isn't
adopted
as
far
as
i
know
to
all
the
states.
there
maybe
one
or
two
exceptions.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
an
appropriate
step.
if
a
person
understands
that
he's
being
charged
with
a
crime,
understand
the
nature
of
his
charges
against
him
and
can't
aid
in
his
own
defense,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
try
him.
if
one
of
these
factors
are
lacking
then
it
is
not.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
only
psychiatric
investigation
initiated
by
the
state
was
the
investigation
by
dr.
haines
where
he
reported
that
--
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
subsequently
at
that
time
there
was
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
your
honor.
we
contend
that
this
was
a
deliberate
bypassing
that
the
failure
to
raise
it
was
a
bypassing
that
because
he
raised
the
question
of
his
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
he
must
be
--
he
must
have
known
that
he
could
raise
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
he
must
have
known
that
he
could
have
raised
this
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
therefore
the
failure
to
raise
it
was
a
deliberate
bypass.
further,
the
weighing
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
by
the
respondent
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
alright
your
honor.
that
is
of
course
a
contention
raised
by
the
respondent
as
been
so
held
by
one
of
the
courts
of
appeal.
we
contend
that
that
overlooks
the
question
that
he
is
--
that
argument
that
he
used,
represented
by
counsel
at
that
time
your
honor.
on
the
civil
side
of
the
law,
the
rights
of
an
incompetent
can
be
waived
by
his
guardian,
administrator,
and
conservator,
whoever
has
the
care
of
the
incompetent.
we
see
that
applying
in
a
criminal
case,
if
a
--
if
an
attorney
is
representing
him
that
he
cannot
equally
affect
his
rights.
any
other
result
your
honor
would
mean
that
there
was
a
defendant
with
the
past
questionable
history
of
mental
--
well,
past
questionable
mental
history,
he
could
fail
to
raise
that
issue
at
his
trial.
if
he
were
acquitted,
he
would
be
acquitted
and
double
jeopardy
to
prevent
a
further
trial.
if
he
--
if
he
was
convicted
then
he
could
later
go
in
and
attempt
to
have
it
set
aside
by
bringing
a
collateral
attack
upon
that
judgment
raising
that
issue
for
the
first
time.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well
of
course,
the
--
the
--
the
reason
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
question
is
strictly
conjectural
of
course.
i
do
not
know
why
in
this
case
he
didn't.
it
might
be
that
because
they
knew
that
it
wouldn't
eliminate
the
fact
that
he
would
have
to
stand
on
trial.
he
would
only
have
to
stand
trial
and
just
be
institutionalized
until
he
could
stand
trial
and
then
he
would
stay
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
wouldn't
preclude
it
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yeah,
well,
no.
well,
what
i
meant
by
that
answer
was
that
he
would
ultimately
stand
trial
when
he
had
regained
his
sanity
and
at
that
time,
he
could
raise
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
no
request
was
made
before
and
for
this
--
for
insanity
hearing
your
honor
and
on
the
basis
that
he
did
raise
the
question
of
his
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
therefore
the
failure
to
raise
the
question
of
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
must
have
been
deliberately.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
there
are
these
colloquies,
your
honor,
in
which
the
attorneys
--
he
seems
to
be
wanting
to
have
witnesses
called
but
the
attorneys
don't
want
to
but
there
has
been
no
statement
at
all
in
the
record
by
the
attorneys
that
he
did
--
did
not
have
full
cooperation
from
mr.
robinson
at
the
trial.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
was
two
months
before
the
trial
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
offense
was
in
february
of
--
28th
i
--
my
--
it's
my
recollection
is
that
the
examination
was
in
june
or
july
your
honor.
so
it
would
be
about
six
months
after
this
process.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
i
believe
so
your
honor.
i
think
the
police
did.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
illinois
law
on
that
question,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
it
is
the
duty
and
responsibility
of
the
defender's
counsel
to
raise
it.
however,
the
court
if
they
have
any
bona
fide
doubt
about
the
insanity
is
to
on
its
own
motion,
impanel
insanity
jury.
now
often
times,
the
state's
attorney
will
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
individual
is
questionable
and
the
court
would
then
on
its
motion
grant
such
a
sanity
hearing.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
your
honor,
there
was
a
past
commitment
to
a
mental
institution
in
this
person's
background.
i
think
that
is
the
reason
why
a
state
psychiatrist
was
called
into
the
matter.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
was
in
1952
and
he
--
and
then
he
was
subsequently
out
in
‘53,
so
i
don't
think
the
record
is
exactly
clear.
i
would
imagine
about
six
to
eight
months
would
be
my
--
my
estimation,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
your
honor,
there's
nothing
else.
besides
the
question
of
waiver,
we
contend
that
the
record
on
its
face
shows
that
--
that
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
by
the
court's
failure
to
impanel
a
sanity
jury.
the
test
here
as
we've
already
discussed
is
that
whether
a
person
has
able
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
in
to
aiding
his
own
defense
--
the
aid
in
his
own
defense.
here,
the
evidence
presented
by
the
four
lay
witnesses,
clearly
to
show
that
this
man
was
a
disturbed
individual
but
it
had
absolutely
no
relevancy
to
the
question
of
whether
he
could
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
into
aiding
his
own
defense.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
stipulated
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist
that
he
was
able
to
understand
that
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
to
aid
in
his
own
defense
and
that
finally,
we
have
the
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
--
the
court
and
the
defendant
which
we
contend
shows
that
he
was
able
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
his
aid
in
his
own
defense.
therefore,
we
contend
that
on
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
that
that
question
was
waived
by
the
failure
to
raise
it
but
it
was
not
waived,
the
record
on
its
face
clearly
shows
that
the
trial
court
correctly
ruled
in
not
holding
the
sanity
hearing
in
this
case.
turning
then
to
the
question
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
district
court
your
honor.
turning
then
to
the
question
suggested
by
this
court
whether
it
would
be
under
both
of
the
hearings
indicated
in
the
order
of
the
dis
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
to
be
held
--
they
should
be
held
in
the
federal
or
in
the
state
court.
we
contend
your
honors
that
they
should
be
held
in
the
state
court
if
at
all.
we
contend
that
this
is
not
made
evidence
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jackson
versus
denno.
there,
there
was
a
question
of
the
voluntary.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
he
did
in
1953
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
that
was
--
his
confinement
occurred
about
eight
months
after.
and
the
record
isn't
clear
on
these
months.
all
that
was
indicated
--
he
went
--
he
was
confined
in
1952.
his
wife
left
him
after
he
was
released
and
he
shot
his
child
in
1953.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
after
he
was
released
and
then
he
served
a
sentence
for
the
murder
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
tried
and
convicted
for
the
murder
of
his
child.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
again,
the
record
is
not
too
clear.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
was
served
in
prison.
there
was
no
question
of
his
insanity
raised
or
--
or
determined
in
respect
to
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
your
honor,
in
a
penitentiary.
i
don't
think
that
the
record
is
clear.
there's
just
nothing
to
show
that
it
was
anything
other
than
that
that
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
the
second
of
the
three
quotes
that
i
drew
your
honor's
attention
to
when
you
asked
me
about
the
question
of
the
right
to
call
a
psychiatrist
in
the
case.
that
is
the
citation
on
page
147.
i
dispute
it
insofar
as
i
think
it
is
refuted
by
the
final
quotation
that
i
would
call
at
your
court's
attention,
your
honors
attention
to
when
the
state
--
the
statement
of
counsel
close
to
the
case
where
he
says
i
didn't
get
a
copy
--
a
witness
said
i
couldn't,
a
psychiatric
witness
because
i
couldn't
tell
in
advance
what
he
would
testify
to
and
that
i
don't
like
to
call
any
such
witness
unless
i
know
what
his
testimony
is.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
just
read
the
record
as
it
stands
here
your
honor
and
determined
on
the
basis
of
that
record
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
--
to
a
habeas
corpus.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
your
honor
to
indicate
that
he
was
except
that
the
court
said
i
will
issue
a
capias
if
he
has
been
subpoenaed.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
a
capias
ever
was
issued.
therefore,
i
conclude
that
he
was
not
but
it's
merely
an
inference
drawing
from
–
from
this
reading
and
this
reading
at
the
[inaudible].
in
jackson
versus
denno,
this
court
held
that
the
requirement
of
the
--
the
rule
of
new
york
law
procedure
under
which
a
question
of
voluntary
confession
was
determined
by
a
jury,
was
the
denial
of
--
of
the
due
process
of
law.
this
court
held
that
there
should
be
an
independent
judicial
determination
of
that
question.
however,
instead
of
reversing
the
conviction
of
the
individual
whose
confession
was
ruled
on
by
the
jury,
this
court
sent
the
case
back
to
the
new
york
court
for
the
determination
of
that
issue
as
to
separate
judicial
determination
of
whether
his
insanity
--
his
confession
was
voluntary
or
not.
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
--
the
conviction
could
stand,
if
it
was
not
then
the
conviction
–
of
course
a
new
trial
would
be
required.
we
contend
that
this
is
an
all
force
with
the
issue
of
the
question
of
his
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
if
what
he
was
denied
was
a
--
a
paneling
of
the
--
of
the
jury
and
the
jury
hearing
on
this
question,
this
can
be
cured
by
sending
the
case
back
to
an
illinois
court
for
such
a
hearing
if
they
determined
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
of
course,
the
conviction
have
to
be
set
aside.
if
they
determine
that
he
was
insane
then
the
conviction
could
stand.
we
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
not
on
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
because
that
was
never
raised.
they
have
of
course
passed
on
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
crime,
but
there
if
that
were
so,
if
there
were
some
defect
in
that,
you
would
be
saying
that
he
didn't
have
an
adequate
hearing
on
that
question
of
the
state
court.
and
then
we
think
that
also
in
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
that
jackson
versus
denno
would
require
a
hearing
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
that
is
my
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
so
on
this
basis,
your
honor,
we
contend
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
correct
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
we
ask
you
to
remand
it.
i
would
reserve
any
further
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
ask
you
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
your
honor
and
reinstate
the
decision
of
the
district
court
which
had
dismissed
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
as
to
where
mr.
robinson
is
now,
he
is
now
in
the
penal
institution
in
joliet,
illinois,
not
the
psychiatric
penal
institution
at
menrad
near
chester.
he
is
in
the
regular
institution
not
the
psychiatric
institution.
the
counsel
argues
that
there
--
the
haste
in
which
this
trial
was
conducted
denied
him
certain
rights
of
primary
which
where
his
sixth
amendment
rights
to
subpoena
any
witnesses.
now
he
raised
--
that
issue
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
two
to
one
held
that
there
was
no
denial
of
any
sixth
amendment
rights.
since
no
cross
petition
for
certiorari
was
taken
and
we
deem
that
this
question
is
no
longer
in
that
case.
however,
the
facts
clearly
show
that
this
is
not
--
that
there
was
no
violation
here.
in
response
to
the
question
whether
a
professional
man
can't
be
subpoenaed,
it
is
my
recollection
of
the
law
that
he
can
be
subpoenaed
to
--
there's
a
conflict
to
this
but
the
general
rule
is
that
he
can
be
subpoenaed
to
testify
as
to
any
fact
that
he
observed
or
saw
but
there
is
this
conflict
as
to
whether
he
can
be
required
to
give
an
expert
testimony
on
question
unless
there
is
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
believe
he
might
be
able
to
answer
hypothetical
question
your
honor.
he
is
a
witness
although
as
an
expert.
i'm
not
sure.
i
won't
answer
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
was
my
understanding
on
the
law
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
don't
think
illinois
has
a
direct
rule
on
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
that
that
--
that
the
state
--
let
me
put
it
this
way
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
[inaudible]
of
the
question
not
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
but
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
the
defense
had
asserted
this
defense
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
then
attempted
to
prove
that
defense.
the
state
subsequently
said
or
i
believe
stipulate
--
we
have
stipulated
at
the
rebuttal,
they
stipulated
the
testimony
of
dr.
haines
and
then
they
said,
well
maybe
we
ought
to
call
him
and
get
him
directly
to
testify
because
there
were
some
disagreement
as
to
what
stipulation
was
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
on
that
position
generally
of
course,
it
was
the
state
that
wanted
to
call
dr.
haines.
he
was
to
be
a
state's
witness
to
testify
as
to
the
sanity
of
the
respondent.
it's
the
state's
right.
we
are
not
contending
that
our
rights
were
wrong
but
the
failure
to
call
it
--
to
call
this
witness.
i
don't
see
how
it
would
have
hated
the
respondent's
case
to
have
additional
states
witness
called.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
believe
that
at
least
--
i
don't
know
that
the
evidence
goes
that
far
your
honor,
but
at
least
it
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
don't
--
no
[inaudible]
at
least
the
states
attorney
wanted
to
have
this
additional
evidence
in
the
record,
the
court
thought
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
far
as
the
stipulated
testimony
that
is
the
record
yet
it
was
only
that
he
was
sane
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
don't
read
the
record
that
way
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
they
--
they
already
have
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
they
already
had
his
full
testimony
in
respect
to
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
that
was
that
the
defendant
was
sane
that
he
was
able
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
aid
in
his
own
defense.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well,
it
was
stipulated
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
would
so
testify.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
your
honor,
haines
was
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
head
director
of
the
state
department
there
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
--
of
the
psychiatric
department.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
not
your
honor.
all
there
is
in
the
record
are
the
three
excerpts
that
i've
related
to
doctor
--
to
mr.
justice
fortas
in
that
respect.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
your
honor
that
they
did
--
that
the
court
did
try
the
issue
of
his
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime
during
the
trial,
yes
sir.
i
do
not
think
either
they
did
try
the
issue
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
because
that
could
only
be
raised
by
a
sanity
hearing
and
one
was
not
requested
and
one
was
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
what
does
that
record
represent?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
positive
of
what
he
meant
by
that
your
honor.
the
illinois
law
as
to
the
contrary
is
clear.
he
should
note
that
this
was
mr.
mcdermott
who
made
this
closing
argument,
the
primary
attorney
in
the
--
for
the
defense
and
the
one
that
was
experienced,
the
professor
at
the
depaul
university.
the
other
one
was
mr.
carey.
he
did
not
make
that
argument.
this
was
the
younger
of
the
two,
the
less
least
experience,
i
just
don't
know
what
he
meant
by
that.
maybe
he
was
attempting
to
raise
at
that
time,
but
if
he
was,
he
was
using
the
incorrect
mode
of
doing
so.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well
by
this
time
your
honor,
he
had
all
the
evidence
in
the
record
before
him.
he
had
the
stipulation
of
the
evidence
of
the
testimony
of
doctor
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
far
as
i
can
tell
you
your
honor,
he
did
not.
that
is
my
opinion
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
did
say
that
that
is
an
issue
raised.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
it
was
not
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
thank
you,
your
honor.
