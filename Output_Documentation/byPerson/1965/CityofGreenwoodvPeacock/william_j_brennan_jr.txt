justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
smith,
do
i
gather
correctly,
you're
asking
this
you
have
it
said
so,
overrule
the
rives-powers
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
suggest
that
can
be
distinguished,
you
just
think
we
have
to
overrule
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
other
question
mr.
smith.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you'd
have
this
hearing
in
the
federal
court
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
is
being
unfair
to
the
negro
defendants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
been
concluded
that
it
is
affirmatively
that
state
courts
would
be
unfair
then
what
did
you
say
what
happened
to
plessy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
try
them
on
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
wouldn't
dismiss
the
prosecutions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
take
that
case
for
example.
as
i
understand
it
your
position
is
that
all
the
peacock
and
the
others
were
engaged
in
doing
was
legitimate
civil
rights
activities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
they
were
not
engaged
actually
in
obstructing
any
sidewalks
in
any
manner
that
would
not
be
privilege,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
so
that
if
on
the
trial
of
that
issue
might
be
before
the
judge
without
a
jury,
if
you
were
to
prevail,
i
gather
that
that's
what
would
the
result
be.
justice

negro
is

out,
drumming
up
registration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
he
is
guilty
of
some

what
would
be
your
position
--
what
will
happen
then
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that's
a
situation
as
i
understood
you
earlier
that
would
be
a
trial
on
new
merits
in
the
federal
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
think
of
a
situation
in
which
as
i
understand
your
petition
here,
it
is
that
you've
established
in
the
federal
court
that
the
activity
was
all
protected
activity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
in
that
circumstance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
result
would
have
to
be
a
dismissal
of
the
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
suppose
in
carrying
on
protected
activity,
some
overstepped
the
violence
then
what
happens
in
the
federal
district
court?

well,
this
is

this
is
i
suggest
not
merely
a
mississippi
decision
that
would
come
out
your
way
and
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
would
happened
let's
say
in
the
watson
situation
where
there
were
some
legitimate
protected
conduct
of
some
kind
but
it
was
in
response
to
a

--

--
that
there
was
a
removal.

that
was

is
that
