well,
it
is
possible
is
it
not
to
read
section
1
of
1443
to
say
something
pretty
much
right
along
those
lines
and
that
is
to
read
it
the
way
judge
sobeloff
in
the
fourth
circuit
suggested
and
that
it
might
be
read.

of

it
not?

there's

are
you
relying

on

stewart
how
would
it
be
true
even
in
a

case
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
could
show
that
the

was

the

was

do
you

do
you
depend
for
your

in
such
cases
as
rape
cases,
murder
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
then
rely
on
section
2
of
1443
at
all
or
do
you
also
rely
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
talking
about
section
2?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
did
and
how
do
you
--
do
i
understand
then
that
you
would
agree
that
the
language
of
section
2
applies
only
to

who
are

justice

your
version

2
of
1443,
a

charged
with

with

with

an
