justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lott,
i
don't
read
circuit
judge
bell's
opinion
that
way
and
i'd
like
to
get
your
help
on
this.
as
i
read
his
opinion,
he
explains
the
way
this
court's
earlier
cases
under
1443
by
emphasizing
that
they
arose
on
the
context
of
an
alleged
denial
of
rights
with
respect
to
the
composition
of
the
jury.
he
says
that
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
--
this
court
articulated
its
decision
in
terms
of
the
absence
of
any
state
statute
or
state
constitutional
provision.
he
says
that
as
i
read
in
this
case
the
--
those
cases
--
our
earlier
cases
don't
apply
because
here,
the
difficulty
does
stem
from
the
application
of
a
state
statute,
namely
the
state
statute
that
makes
of
a
crime
to
obstruct
the
sidewalk
and
so
on
and
as
i
read
his
opinion,
what
he
says
has
to
be
tried
out.
it's
not
the
motive
of
the
prosecutor,
but
the
question
as
to
whether
the
state
statute
has
been
applied
here
so
as
to
deprive
the
accused
of
his
equal
civil
rights.
in
other
words,
he
would
try
out
the
question
as
to
whether
this
is
--
whether
the
context
of
the
prosecution
here,
context
of
the
defendant's
actions
is
such
and
that
this
is
substantially
speaking
and
therefore
to
interfere
with
their
rights
of
free
assembly
or
free
speech
or
whatever.
as
i
read
it
in
one
place
here
in
discussing
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
rachel,
he
says
that
the
teaching
of
rachel
is
that
you're
to
construe
the
state
statute
as
if
there
were
a
gloss
on
it
saying
that
this
statute
may
not
be
applied
in
peaceful
city
and
demonstrations
reading
from
page
26
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
don't
--
the
question
i'm
asking
is
whether
you
differ
with
that
reading
of
this
or
whether
your
position
is
that
that
amounts
to
an
inquiry
into
the
motive
of
the
prosecution.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
the
circuit
judge
bell's
opinion
says
that
that
discrimination
with
respect
to
grand
jury
selection
was
not
based
on
any
state
statute
or
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
suggesting
i
agree
with
that
course.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
he's
saying.
justice
abe
fortas
he
says
that
that
is
the
application
of
a
state
statute
in
an
invidious
way.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
suppose
--
would
you
consider
it
relevant
or
pertinent
to
the
removal
issue
to
offer
evidence
with
respect
to
bias
and
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
judge?
or
do
you
think
that
that
evidence
of
that
sort
might
properly
be
excluded?
let
me
put
it
this
way.
is
it
your
position
that
the
only
thing
that
would
be
relevant
to
support
removal
of
the
case
from
the
state
to
the
federal
court
would
be
evidence
going
to
the
general
system
of
the
administration
of
justice
as
distinguished
to
what
has
been
referred
to
here
as
putting
the
state
court
itself
on
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
sorry.
is
there
anything
else
that
you
could
foresee
as
being
a
matter
that
you
might
go
into
at
trial
under
the
pleadings
in
this
case?
you
now
mention
the
jury
systematically
excluded
negroes
from
the
jury,
the
possibility
of
attacking
or
testing
a
motivation
on
the
prosecutor
and
the
qualifications
or
suitability
of
the
state
judge
under
the
recusation
statute.
is
there
anything
else
that
you
can
help
me
with
--?
justice
abe
fortas
so
was
it
--
would
you
limit
removal
of
possibility
under
1443
to
situations
in
which
the
action
for
which
a
person
is
being
prosecuted
in
the
state
court
where
that
action
takes
place
in
a
civil
rights
context.
i
take
it
that
you
would
not
so
limit
it.
let's
take
just
a
case
of
rape.
justice
abe
fortas
or
a
case
of
murder
with
no
civil
rights
connection
at
all.
i
suppose
your
response
to
a
previous
question
means
that
you
would
think
that
1443
is
available
for
removal
to
a
federal
court
there
upon
a
proper
showing.
justice
abe
fortas
either
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
you
continue
talking
about
negroes
here
and
i
suppose
that
that
would
also
apply
to
a
white
person
let's
say
who
was
a
civil
rights
worker.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
maybe
wrong
but
i
thought
that
in
rachel,
there
were
a
couple
of
white
persons,
civil
rights
workers.
justice
abe
fortas
two
in
here.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
also
that
this
would
apply
--
let
me
just
assume
this
situation
in
which
a
white
man
was
arrested
for
some
racial
business,
miscegenation
or
whatever
it
might
be
or
some
crime
involving
a
person
of
the
opposite
race.
justice
abe
fortas
that
1443
would
theoretically
be
available
there.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
smith
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
smith,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
your
position
makes
it
rather
irrelevant
what
the
particular
charge
is
whether
the
person
is
arrested
for
an
ordinary
everyday
murder
or
an
ordinary
everyday
rape
or
for
violence
and
breach
of
peace
or
what
not?
the
question
that
you're
going
to
raise
is
whether
he
will
get
a
fair
trial
on
the
basis
of
factors
relating
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
that
particular
jurisdiction
in
the
state
courts.
that
is
to
say
jury
selection
and
so
on
and
then
the
evidence
that
you
have
presented
in
support
of
removal
will
go
to
that
question
not
to
the
question,
although
it
may
be
the
part
of
the
evidence.
but
the
focus
of
your
evidence
will
not
be
whether
he
engaged
in
violence
from
them
and
peaceful
picketing
or
whether
he
violated
the
law
or
didn't
violate
the
law
below
but
the
focus
of
your
evidence
in
support
of
removal
will
be
whether
he
can
get
a
fair
trial
or
not,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
basic
charge
is.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
claiborne
but
are
you
saying
that
the
allegations
allege
an
equal
protection
right
and
then
the
case
in
the
federal
court
want
to
go
ahead
and
try
it.
in
other
words
the
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
removal
determines
based
on
the
pleadings?
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
don't
--
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
because
you
said
then
you
go
ahead
with
the
jury
trial.
i
assume
you
don't
mean
to
have
two
jury
trials.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
well,
are
the
allegations
of
the
petition
for
removal
to
be
taken
as
conclusive?
suppose
a
state
comes
in
and
contests
and
what
happens
then?
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
then
saying
that
if
the
petition
for
removal
adequately
sets
forth
a
case
for
removal
regardless
of
the
contest
--
of
contesting
allegations
by
the
state
and
then
the
--
there
would
be
no
remand
to
the
state
court
and
the
trial
won't
go
ahead
on
the
merits
in
the
federal
court.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
in
this
delightful
a
la
carte
menu
that
you
and
mr.
smith
and
mr.
amsterdam
have
presented
to
us
this
