mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
we're
looking
for
in
this
case,
willie
peacock
and
the
13
people
that
were
arrested
with
him
is
a
fair
trial.
what
we
can't
get
in
mississippi
state
courts
is
a
fair
trial.
that
was
what
congress
had
on
its
mind
in
1866
when
it
passed
this
civil
rights
removal
bill.
this
civil
rights
removal
bill
was
the
third
part
of
the
first
civil
rights
act
and
it
simply
said
that
colored
people,
negroes
and
newly
freed
slaves
are
going
to
have
to
be
brought
up
to
the
level
of
a
white
man.
this
was
the
intent
of
the
39th
congress.
it
was
the
intent
of
the
fourteenth,
thirteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
it
was
the
philosophy
of
the
age
that
the
negro
was
going
to
be
brought
up
to
the
level
of
the
white
man
and
if
the
federal
power
was
going
to
see
to
it
that
this
happens.
and
what
happened
in
this
situation
was
they
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
it
said,
negroes
are
going
to
have
the
same
right
as
white
people
and
the
federal
government
is
going
to
see
to
it
that
if
any
of
these
rights
are
deprived,
people
can
be
prosecuted,
that
was
the
second
section
of
that
act.
the
third
section
said
if
there's
going
to
be
any
prosecution
of
these
negroes
and
the
unionists,
there's
going
to
be
removal
into
the
federal
courts
where
they
can
get
a
fair
trial.
everybody
knew
in
1866
that
the
negroes,
if
they
were
going
to
be
tried
by
these
reconstructionists
or
obstructionists
state
governments,
they
were
going
to
be
tried
by
ex-confederate
judges
and
that
the
negroes
weren't
going
to
get
a
fair
trial
and
that
any
white
man
in
the
south
that
took
the
union
calls
will
never
get
a
fair
trial.
that
was
true.
they
tried
to
rescue
slavery
in
mississippi
in
1865
and
they
just
barely
missed
it.
they
couldn't
repeal
it.
the
courts
that
freedmen's
courts
that
were
set
up
in
mississippi
phased
themselves
out
in
early
1865
so
that
there
was
no
longer
any
control
over
how
negroes
were
going
to
be
tried
and
there
was
no
review
of
the
method
about
which
they
were
going
to
be
tried.
the
same
things
that
that
congress
in
1866
was
talking
about,
is
in
mississippi
today.
it
was
in
mississippi
in
1964.
i
was
there.
that's
where
these
prosecutions
came
from.
negroes
and
civil
rights
workers
in
mississippi
are
not
going
to
get
fair
trials
in
those
state
courts
and
they
don't
get
them
because
they
don't
have
negroes
on
juries.
they
have
white
judges,
white
prosecutors,
white
jurymen,
white
sheriff
that
are
all
elected
by
white
electorates
from
which
negroes
are
eliminated.
negroes
are
gradually
getting
their
right
to
vote
under
the
new
act
but
they're
long
way
from
it.
there
are
nearly
400,000
negroes
that
i
think
are
eligible
to
vote
under
the
provisions
of
the
new
act
in
mississippi
and
there's
not
85,000
registered
yet.
the
whole
idea
of
the
mississippi
plan
of
1890
was
to
keep
negroes
off
those
juries
by
keeping
them
off
the
voting
rolls.
now
the
only
thing
that
we
say
is
that
the
congress
said
that
this
was
not
an
act
passed
in
1866
for
the
civil
rights
movement
or
for
civil
rights
people
just
about
themselves.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
don't
agree
with
the
previous
argument
that
this
was
an
act
passed
that
would
allow
removal
when
somebody
goes
out
and
does
something
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
does
something
consistent
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
say
it
was
passed
for
the
negro
who
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
in
the
state
court.
that
was
one
they
passed.
now
what
that
means
is
that
they're
going
to
send
--
under
this
interpretation,
their
recent
powers
put
on
this
thing,
they
can't
get
a
fair
trial
and
a
fair
federal
tribunal
unless
the
state
so
dumb
that
they
passed
an
act
that
says
negroes
can't
serve
on
the
juries.
and
no
state
--
no
southern
court
--
is
that
enough,
there's
no
southern
state
government
is
going
to
do
anything
like
that.
they've
learned
their
lesson.
the
whole
philosophy
here
was
that
the
legal
machinery
of
the
states,
the
reconstructive
states,
the
ex-confederate
state
was
that
they're
going
to
use
the
federal
power,
i
mean
the
state
power
to
prosecute
the
unionists
in
their
midst
and
the
negroes.
what
happened
after
the
civil
war
was
that
the
negroes
were
freed.
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them
roaming
the
south
without
any
education,
without
any
money,
without
any
jobs,
without
any
homes
and
they
passed
these
black
codes.
these
black
codes
are
just
about
like
the
slave
codes.
the
only
thing
that
it
didn't
have
is
it
didn't
say
slavery.
that
was
the
only
difference
and
the
negro
had
to
register.
he
had
to
have
a
labor
contract.
he
had
to
indenture
his
children.
he
had
to
pay
a
head
tax.
he
couldn't
move
around
without
a
travel
permit.
he
was
a
class
of
indentured
servants
and
when
he
was
prosecuted
for
not
doing
these
things,
the
federal
law
says
he
had
the
right
to
remove
them.
that's
what
that
second
section
of
1443
means
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor,
the
federal
officers
and
the
state
officers
are
trying
to
do
the
job.
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
if
we
don't
give
some
meaning
to
this
federal
removal
statute
then
there's
no
use
talking
about
equality.
if
a
man
is
going
to
--
what
they
were
going
to
do
and
what
they
did
do
and
what
they're
doing
in
mississippi
now
and
what
they're
doing
in
parts
of
louisiana
now
is
they're
prosecuting
people
for
civil
rights
activity
and
they
just
go
out
and
pick
up
a
negro
who
is
not
involved
in
the
civil
rights
movement,
he's
got
a
prosecution
against
him.
they
can't
get
a
fair
trial
because
they're
black
and
civil
rights
people
who
are
white
can
get
a
fair
trial
because
they're
coming
down
there
from
the
north
and
all
of
that.
so
what
they
do
is
in
trial
within
a
state
court
where
they've
got
a
built-in
decision
and
they
know
they're
going
to
convict
them.
no
lawyers
in
the
community
are
going
to
represent
them
because
it's
not
popular
to
do
that.
what
happens
is,
they
can't
get
a
proper
counsel
and
they
get
convicted
and
they
get
high
bail.
they
get
--
you've
got
two
cases
up
here
now
asking
for
certiorari
from
this
court.
one
is
baines,
that's
the
danville
case
and
one
is
bowman
out
of
montgomery,
out
of
[inaudible].
if
you
read
those
cases,
you'll
find
out
the
judge
comes
to
court
with
a
pistol,
if
a
searcher
by
walks
into
the
courtroom,
search
the
brief
cases,
search
the
persons,
there
are
policemen
standing
around
with
guns
on,
you
can't
get
a
fair
trial
in
that
kind
of
an
atmosphere.
that
was
what
the
whole
removal
statute
was
all
about
then.
i
would
have
been
able
to
show
you
something
like
that
too
if
the
district
judge
below
give
me
an
opportunity
to
get
a
hearing.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
want
to
be
able
to
take
deposition
that
i
can
show
than
in
leflore
county,
negroes
don't
serve
on
juries.
negroes
who
are
beat
up
and
shot
at
the
night,
they
were
arrested
when
they
try
to
register
to
vote,
that
was
what
they
were
doing
here.
they
were
--
what
happened
in
these
cases,
i'll
tell
you
what
willie
peacock
was
doing.
he
wasn't
trying
to
violate
the
law.
he
was
trying
to
see
if
the
law
was
followed.
he
wasn't
out
just
demonstrating
to
them
to
block
the
city
sidewalks.
they
found
that
if
they
wanted
negroes
to
register
so
as
to
in
an
orderly
fashion
change
the
policy
and
the
government
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
bring
it
into
the
20th
century
where
it
belongs
that
you're
going
to
have
to
have
negroes
register
and
vote
so
that
the
voting
processes
that
makes
this
country
great.
the
democratic
processes
of
a
vote
means
something
to
people
so
that
there
is
some
participation
in
government.
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do
and
they
found
that
if
they
went
to
a
negro
who
lived
on
a
farm
and
said,
uncle
or
aunt,
friend
or
brother,
whoever
it
was
miss
so
and
so,
mister
so
and
so,
come
on
down
and
vote
and
they're
going
to
say,
we're
scared
to
go
to
that
white
man's
courthouse.
i'll
tell
you
when
i
was
getting
into
that.
that's
just
a
big
white
man's
courthouse.
that's
all
the
law
means
to
me.
he
just
got
a
bad
yawn
and
you
better
look
out.
don't
hang
around
there.
that's
just
where
you
pay
your
taxes.
so
what
the
civil
rights
workers
were
saying
was,
okay
if
you're
scared
to
go,
we'll
go
with
you
and
we'll
be
there
with
you
and
we'll
show
them
that
if
we
have
the
courage
to
go
with
you,
maybe
you'll
have
the
courage
to
go
down
and
vote.
so
what
they
do
is
they
put
on
a
freedom
day
and
they
marched
around
that
courthouse
with
a
sign
which
says
“one
man,
one
vote”
or
something
about
voting
and
the
negroes
would
trickle
into
that
registrar's
office.
and
the
police
would
come
down
and
say
you're
blocking
the
sidewalk
and
throw
everybody
in
jail.
that's
what
was
going
on.
that's
what
was
going
on
all
over
mississippi.
throw
them
in
jail
and
try
them
the
next
day.
we
have
to
file
this
removal
petition
in
peacock.
drew
it
up
one
night
and
went
up
to
mississippi
the
next
day
to
stop
the
trials
during
that
day
because
they
were
going
to
trial.
so
all
i'm
saying
to
you
gentlemen
is
that
that
was
what
we
were
talking
about
when
we
passed
this
thing
by
the
39th
congress
and
there's
no
getting
around
it.
if
you're
going
to
tell
the
negro
and
asked
what
it
was
passed
for,
if
you're
going
to
tell
and
he's
got
equal
civil
rights,
don't
tell
him
and
then
kid
him
about
it.
give
him
some
opportunity
to
enforce
these
civil
rights
and
to
protect
himself
and
to
get
a
fair
trial.
now
in
maybe
four
or
five,
ten
years,
when
the
negro
gets
to
vote
in
the
south
like
i
hopefully
think
he's
going
to
get
it,
then
maybe
he'll
be
able
to
elect
some
judges
and
some
sheriffs
and
maybe
he'll
be
able
to
get
on
some
jury
rolls,
but
right
now,
he
can't
do
it.
only
in
a
very
few
areas
do
you
find
them
serving
on
jury.
so
if
you're
going
to
give
him
the
franchise
and
you
know
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957,
1960,
1964
and
1965,
you
go
out
in
these
country
parishes
in
louisiana
and
these
country
counties
in
mississippi,
they
don't
know
where
it
is.
they
haven't
seen
it.
it
hadn't
changed
their
lives
any.
they
still
don't
go
to
the
courthouse
and
vote.
they
still
don't
get
their
roads
pay.
they
still
don't
have
any
participation
in
the
government.
they're
still
afraid
of
the
sheriff
because
he's
a
white
man's
law.
and
the
thing
about
it
is,
he
doesn't
know
that
there's
a
federal
presence
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
it
doesn't
touch
him.
now
it
might
touch
somebody
in
jackson,
but
that's
it.
what
we
got
to
do
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
what
you
have
to
do
is
like
the
statute
says.
it
says
a
clear
concise
brief
statement
of
what's
going
on
and
peacock,
i
admit,
i
do
this
pretty
hastily
at
night
trying
to
get
it
up
there
and
stop
these
things.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
short,
brief,
concise
statement
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
--
of
the
grounds
upon
which
you
remove
but
i
think
if
you
track
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
think
if
you
simply
make
the
allegation
like
i
did
in
peacock
that
you've
been
deprived
of
certain
constitutional
rights
and
i
said,
you've
been
deprived
of
the
right
--
is
denied,
i'm
saying
denied.
i
think
that's
the
operative
language,
is
denied
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
laws
and
the
due
process
of
the
laws
in
as
much
as
other
things
he
was
arrested,
charged
and
he's
to
be
tried
under
state
statute
that
is
unconstitutional
and
unconstitutionally
applied.
i
think
that's
enough
to
show
denial.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
was
saying
that
the
statute,
to
be
frank
with
you
in
the
peacock
case,
i
think
that
i
had
reference
to
the
statute
under
which
he
was
being
charged
this
courthouse
picketing
statute,
not
courthouse
picketing
but
the
blocking
the
sidewalk
statute.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
but
i
think
that
it
can
be
reasonably
inferred
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
was
also
talking
about
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
be
tried
under
a
system
of
strict
racial
segregation
because
in
that
paragraph
by
saying
this
statute
is
vague
and
definitely
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
it's
unconstitutional
and
arbitrarily
applied
and
used
and
is
enforced
in
this
instance
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
unconstitutional
and
strict
policy
of
racial
segregation
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
the
city
of
greenwood.
now
that's
all
i
said
and
then
i
said,
he
was
being
--
i
said
he
is
not
only
not
guilty
but
he
cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
mississippi
the
rights
he
possesses
providing
for
the
equal
rights
of
citizens
of
united
states
nor
can
he
act
under
authority
of
the
four
mentioned
provisions
providing
for
equal
protection
of
the
rights
and
i
cite
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
my
thoughts
on
the
procedure
would
be
that
if
i
have
to
defend
that,
if
i
was
the
removing
petitioner,
i'd
sit
down
and
institute
a
hearing
on
the
jury
selection
process
in
that
county
and
i'd
also
call
in
the
sheriff
and
i'd
call
in
the
law
enforcement
official.
we
did
this
in
the
retrial
of
the
cameron
case
which
this
court
sent
back
to
us
to
retrial.
we
tried
it
over
biloxi
in
last
october.
you
also
said
he
wanted
a
better
record
in
that
case
and
so
we
retried
it
and
what
we
did
was
we
put
the
prosecutor
on
the
stand
and
i
said
to
the
prosecutor
for
example,
here,
you're
arresting
people
for
parading
around
the
county
courthouse
in
forrest
county,
mississippi.
i
said,
what
about
the
football
parade
that
you
have
in
town.
you
know,
it's
just
as
bad
to
block
the
courthouse
for
those
football
parade
as
it
is
to
blocking
with
the
sign
that
says
“one
man
one
vote”.
he
said,
“well,
that's
a
football
parade.
you
know,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.”
i
said,
“well
these
people
are
just
as
serious
of
what
they're
talking
about
as
you
are
with
your
football
parades
and
you
admit
that
it
blocks
the
courthouse,
this
is
selective
enforcement
of
the
statute
which
was
condemned
in
cox
versus
louisiana.”
so
as
to
the
kind
of
hearing
that
i
would
undertake
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
show
that
kind
of
selective
enforcement.
i
would
show
that
negroes
don't
serve
on
the
jury
and
i'd
show
to
the
federal
court
by
these
experiences
of
useful
--
using
the
federal
rules
to
develop
a
record,
i'll
show
that
he
could
not
enforce
in
the
courts
of
that
state
equal
civil
right
of
having
a
fair
trial.
and
once
i've
done
that,
i
would
say,
“okay,
now
we
try
the
case
in
the
federal
court
where
you'll
get
a
fair
trial”
which
is
what
this
thing
is
all
about
anyway.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
sir.
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that.
i
think
this
act
was
passed
to
cover
the
prosecution
of
negroes
in
an
unfair
atmosphere.
that's
what
the
congress
in
1866
had
in
their
mind.
justice
black
mentioned
something
about
prosecuting
negroes
in
watson,
new
york
and
i
think
that's
where
it
came
up.
i
think
that
if
they're
denied
a
fair
trial,
if
they
can't
enforce
in
those
courts,
if
the
arrest
is
racially
motivated,
if
the
trial
is
going
to
be
stacked
in
the
deck
against
them
as
mr.
lott
says,
i
don't
care
if
you
live
in
watson,
new
york.
i
still
think
they're
entitled
to
removal.
it
just
so
happens
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
and
we're
talking
about
the
states
of
the
rebellion
and
so
i
don't
agree
with
that
previous
counsel
about
that
point.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
right.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
we've
got
that
problem
in
louisiana
where
it's
probably
a
racial
crime.
we
don't
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
it
could
arguably.
yes
sir,
i
really
do.
i
think
that
that
was
what
we've
talked
about
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir
and
it
might
work
out.
that
is
a
matter
of
judicial
administration
too
because
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
that's
right.
we
--
i
just
can't
see
in
a
situation
like
where
we're
really
talking
about
the
development
of
the
judicial
administration
why
we
can't
remove
these
cases
and
get
this
question
of
discrimination
on
jury
as
a
trial
to
go
over
with
on
the
first
level
when
--
rather
than
this
habeas
corpus
up
and
down
like
a
yo-yo
thing.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
i
don't
see
the
basis
for
those
cases.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you've
got
to
--
i
think
those
are
the
same
kind
of
cases
you
overruled
when
you
overruled
plessy.
i
think
they
have
a
same
indication
when
they
still
didn't
compromise
came
out
that
sold
out
the
negro
in
the
south
by
removing
those
reconstruction
governments
and
putting
the
texas
pacific
railway
through
the
country.
that
was
sealing
the
faith
of
the
negro.
plessy
versus
ferguson
was
just
an
aspect
of
it
just
as
in
these
cases
it's
an
aspect
of
it
too.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i'd
try
the
case
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well
after
a
man
is
charged
for
example
with
rape
or
murder
and
he
is
indicted.
now
the
only
real
question
is
whether
he
is
going
to
get
a
fair
trial
that
he
is
involved
--
not
involved
in
any
civil
rights
work.
but
if
it's
a
civil
rights
case
and
for
example
in
the
rachel
case,
if
i
would
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
in
this
case
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
more
than
you'd
be
doing
it
by
walking
down
the
sidewalk
yourself.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
will
be
a
dismissal
there.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
it
would
be
a
dismissal
there.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
i
can't
understand
the
previous
counsel
talking
about
sending
it
back
for
trial
in
the
state
court
when
that's
the
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
oh!
yes.
well,
if
it
was
a
proper
application.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
you
mean
if
the
judge
found
there
was
no
state
discrimination
and
he
was
affirmed
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
then
i
think
the
state
court
would
be
the
proper
forum.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
that's
right,
but
all
we're
looking
for
is
a
fair
trial.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
wouldn't
put
the
state
court
on
trial
anymore
than
the
recusation
statute
to
do
now.
in
other
words,
i
think
we
call
them
recusation
statutes
in
louisiana
where
the
judge
can
be
recused
for
prejudice
and
interest
in
the
case.
if
you
have
to
show
that
that
prejudice
is
racial
then
i
think
that
you
have
the
right
to
do
it
but
i
would
not
put
the
state
court
on
trial
anymore
than
that
recusation
statute
does.
and
as
far
as
the
prosecutor
is
concerned,
unless
there
is
a
statute
that
relates
to
that,
i
don't
know
that
i
want
to
go
into
the
motivation
of
the
prosecutor.
now
i
might
want
to
go
under
the
motivation
of
the
arresting
officer
because
that
would
indicate
what
was
going
on
at
the
scene,
but
segregation
as
prosecutor
theoretically
can
prosecute
impartially.
i
assume
the
--
if
he
operates
it
under
his
oath
with
the
judge.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
go
ahead,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
i
think
if
you
--
you
have
to
--
if
you
have
a
chance
to
read
the
application
in
baines
versus
the
city
of
danville
and
forman
versus
the
city
of
montgomery
which
is
up
before
you
i
think
for
some
decision,
you're
going
to
find
that
the
atmosphere
created
in
the
baines
courtroom,
if
the
allegations
in
the
application
are
correct,
was
such
that
anyone
looking
at
it
could
tell
in
a
minute
you
weren't
going
to
get
a
fair
trial.
now
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
that,
you
can
avoid
doing
something
about
that.
now
i
don't
want
to
try
to
crawl
inside
a
man's
mind
and
find
out
how
he
feels
about
race,
but
where
you've
got
external
objected
manifestations
of
a
reign
of
terror
and
the
absolute
absence
of
justice
or
the
possibility
of
justice,
i
think
you
ought
have
to
be
able
to
inquire
into
that.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
it's
just
as
important
because
if
you
take
a
negro
in
the
south
is
charged
and
one
of
this
country
parishes
or
counties
where
no
negroes
have
ever
served
and
we
held
a
hearing
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
december,
but
we
have
five
or
seven
cases
button
case
and
a
whole
bunch
of
others.
i
have
that
button
case
and
we
showed
every
one
of
these
country
parishes
where
no
negroes
would
ever
serve
on
the
jury.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
and
we
know
about
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
so.
i
think
that
you
just
have
to
face
facts
that
he
is
not
going
to
get
a
fair
trial
either.
there
was
a
georgia
case
that
came
out
on
that.
i
forget
the
name
of
it
but
it
was
a
case
in
which
they
said
that
there
would
be
--
the
civil
rights
worker
was
white
and
he
said
he
was
being
deprived
of
this
fourteenth
amendment
right's
equal
protection
i
think
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
it
might
have
been.
actually
two
in
this
case
are
white.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
two
in
peacock
case
are
white.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
right.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
so.
i
think
where
you
find
that
the
atmosphere
in
these
areas,
rural
areas
particularly
just
forbids
a
fair
trial
because
of
a
racial
bias,
regardless
of
whether
the
defendants
colored
or
white,
then
you've
got
to
recognize
that
that
was
what
this
thing
was
talking
about.
i
think
the
act
is
going
to
phase
itself
out
as
the
society
becomes
more
homogenous
where
the
negroes
participate
in
this
political
life
of
the
south
which
is
what
we're
all
been
looking
for,
for
years
and
then
the
emergency
necessity
of
such
an
interruption
of
a
state
judicial
process
will
pass
out
the
picture
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
federal
government
ought
to
interpose
itself
into
the
state's
affairs
if
the
state
can
give
people
fair
trials
and
that's
what
we're
after.
these
fair
trial
rights
are
federal
rights
and
if
the
state
government
has
the
right
--
has
the
obligation
under
the
supremacy
clause
to
enforce
these
federal
rights
and
they're
given
the
first
opportunity
to
do
it.
if
they
don't
want
to
do
it,
if
they
refuse
to
do
it,
if
they
want
to
use
the
machinery
of
the
state
to
suppress
people
that
are
trying
to
exercise
these
rights
then
they
forfeited
the
right
to
claim
states
rights
and
they're
going
to
forfeit
it
until
they
bring
the
state
governments
into
order
so
that
they
can
say
that
on
the
state
level,
we
obey
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
and
people
in
our
state
colored
and
white
get
a
fair
trial.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
the
language
is
pretty
broad
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i'm
relying
upon
a
lot
of
the
history.
i
think
you
can
find
a
lot
of
this
in
the
brief
but
you
say
in
it
--
you
see,
i'm
relying
on
--
i
can't
just
judge
sobeloff
reading
of
the
first
section
as
he
has
it
in
the
baines
dissent.
i
say
where
the
prosecution
is
against
any
person
who
is
denied
a
right
and
i
skip
there
as
a
right
under
any
law
providing
for
the
equal
civil
rights
of
citizens
and
if
he
is
denied
it,
i
think
he's
denied
it
by
a
racially
motivated
arrest
and
that's
what
justice
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
sir?
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no,
i
don't
think
that
apply
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
i
really
don't.
no.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
don't
think
that
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
rely
upon
the
second
part
there
that
says,
“cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
such
state
against
any
person
who
cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
such
state,
a
right
under
any
law
providing
for
the
equal
civil
rights
of
citizens.”
now
an
accused
rapist
or
an
accused
murderer
who
is
not
arrested
because
he's
a
civil
rights
worker
but
because
he
may
have
committed
a
crime,
i
think
if
he
can't
get
a
fair
trial
before
nondiscriminatory
to
select
a
jury
then
he
ought
to
be
able
to
remove
it.
that's
the
only
grounds
i
think
he'd
have.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
willie
peacock
and
his
group,
i
say
in
the
second
part
of
my
brief
that
they
were
possibly
commentators
too.
but
we
found
there
was
that
the
1964
civil
rights
act
had
been
--
well,
it
hadn't
been
passed
but
two
voting
rights
acts
so
one
of
1957
and
the
one
of
1960
had
been
passed
and
these
would
have
encouraged
negro
registration
and
that's
what
peacock
was
out
there
trying
to
do.
and
i
say
if
he
was
out
there
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
an
interview
with
mr.
katzenbach
the
other
day
by
mr.
kanues
and
they
talked
about,
i
think
mr.
kanues
said
to
mr.
katzenbach,
“isn't
there
some
obligation
on
the
federal
government
to
incur
the
registration
and
not
just
make
certain
that
facilities
are
available,”
says
kanues
and
this
is
what
mr.
katzenbach
said.
he
said,
“no.
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
federal
government
to
uphold
the
law.
my
interpretation
of
the
law
is
that
civil
rights
groups
in
this
case
have
to
put
on
the
drive
to
get
people
to
register.”
now
if
he
is
going
to
say
that
then
these
civil
rights
workers
have
some
protection
coming
to
them
and
i
think
they
have
the
protection
of
this
removal
statute.
it
says
they
can
remove.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir,
you've
asked
me
about
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
sir.
i
don't
disassociate.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
i
make
a
pretty
good
argument
on
that
posse
comitatus
--
comitatus.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
but
i
don't
disassociate
myself
from
the
solicitor
general's
position
in
this
case
which
i
think
is
a
very
well
reasoned
argument
which
mr.
claiborne
will
bring
out
after
i
finish
about
how
it
applies
to
everybody.
now
i
do
have
one
little
argument
at
the
end
of
my
brief
about
the
fact
that
this
last
language
for
refusing
to
do
any
act
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
such
law,
they
want
to
restrict
the
act
there
to
just
apply
to
the
state
officer
who
for
example
is
supposed
to
be
fair
to
negroes
being
prosecuted.
i
say
it
applies
to
all
the
negroes
who
are
being
prosecuted
for
failing
to
do
so
--
actually
in
1866,
failing
to
do
something
on
those
black
codes.
because
the
black
codes
were
enacted
in
mississippi
in
november
of
1865,
this
act
was
passed
in
april
of
1866
and
the
black
codes
were
effective
january
29th,
1866
and
the
black
codes
--
the
negro
just
have
to
sit
around
in
his
living
room
and
do
nothing
then
he's
violating
about
ten
of
them.
so
he'd
be
prosecuted
for
it
and
he
had,
i
think,
under
this
last
paragraph,
last
sent
--
phrase
of
the
last
paragraph
the
right
to
remove
those
prosecution.
that's
my
theory.
now
i
don't
find
a
whole
lot
of
history
behind
that
but
that's
--
at
least
that's
my
feeling
of
what
was
happening
inside.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i've
got
a
case
right
now
where
a
civil
rights
worker
registered
to
vote
in
forrest
county,
mississippi
and
he
filled
out
his
registration
form
and
only
that
it
says
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
any
crime?”
he
said
no
he's
been
convicted
about
four
of
them.
now
that
posed
a
heck
of
a
problem
to
me.
he
had
pleaded
guilty
without
a
counsel
to
three
or
four
of
them
and
it
was
just
a
mess,
but
i
removed
that
case
and
i
think
i
removed
it
not
because
he
was
arrested
for
doing
something
in
the
civil
rights
field
and
that
is
even
trying
to
register
to
vote.
i
removed
it
because
negroes
don't
serve
on
juries
in
forrest
county,
mississippi
and
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
of
a
perjury
charge
that
carried
a
long
sentence
with
it
in
forrest
county,
mississippi
and
that's
why
i
removed
it.
that's
the
only
reason
i
removed
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
--
you
mean
if
they've
act
--
they
may
have
actually
committed
a
crime
in
the
process
of
protected
activity.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
don't
think
that
just
because
they're
doing
civil
rights
work
makes
them
immune
from
the
prosecution
(voice
overlap)
i
think
they'd
be
prosecuted.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
they
would
have
to
be
prosecuted.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
it
depends
if
they're
going
to
go
to
--
i
don't
want
to
one
of
those
state
juries
now.
i
want
to
be
prosecuted
before
a
jury
this
fair.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i'm
afraid
i'd
have
to.
some
of
them
don't
have
jury
just
to
worth
the
name.
you
don't
--
i
don't
know.
it
sounds
rather
extreme
mr.
justice
white
but
some
of
the
problems
you
face
and
some
of
those
counties
are
pretty
extreme
too.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
it
have
to
be
tried.
i
don't
think
you
could
dismiss
it.
i
think
it
have
to
be
tried.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
in
the
federal
court
to
get
a
fair
forum
unless
there
was
a
fair
state
forum
but
not
just
because
they
were
involved
in
protected
activities
and
then
overstepped
the
boundaries
is
not
going
to
--
i
don't
think
that
you
can
protect
them
any
further.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir,
it
would
be.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
i
will
say
again
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
don't
think
this
act
was
tailor-made
for
a
civil
rights
movement.
i
think
it
was
tailor-made
for
the
--
to
raise
the
negro
up
to
the
level
of
the
white
man
giving
them
a
fair
forum.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
now
maybe
congress
shouldn't
have
done
it.
maybe
they
shouldn't
have
passed
it
in
1866.
maybe
this
will
burden
the
federal
courts
but
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
the
history
--
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
see
it
removed
if
you
had
due
process
as
the
question
but
i
don't
think
that's
historically
correct.
i
think
that
white
people
involved
in
this
thing,
you've
got
to
use
the
injunction
like
we
used
in
dombrowski.
i
think
that
that's
really
the
answer
there
as
we
try
to
use
in
cameron.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes.
i'll
be
--
i've
tried
it
to
labor
union,
i
didn't
get
anywhere.
i
did
it
long
time
ago
and
i
didn't
get
anywhere.
i
don't
think
historically
that
they're
entitled
to
use
it.
i
wish
they
were.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
and
they
ought
to
be
entitle
--
in
addition
to
that
--
yes
sir,
in
answer
your
question
then
in
addition
to
that,
they're
ought
to
be
entitled
to
keep
that
case
in
the
federal
court
if
they
can
prove
their
allegations.
if
they
can't
prove
the
allegations,
they're
ought
to
bounce
them
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i'm
getting
a
lot
of
opposition
from
lawyers
generally
and
from
this
court.
i
can
see
on
this
question
of
how
widespread
is
going
to
be
the
effect
of
this
act.
if
i
started
telling
you
that
it
was
going
to
go
to
equal
--
due
process
of
law
then
somebody
is
going
to
start
saying,
you're
going
to
institute
a
federal
system
with
courts
for
the
whole
50
states.
now
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
that
morass
because
i'm
up
here
trying
to
give
it
some
historical
meaning.
it
could
be
interpreted
that
way
sir
but
i
just
don't
think
that
in
all
practicality,
i'd
be
doing
my
case
any
good
to
argue
that.
i
think
if
there's
no
question,
that's
all
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
claiborne.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
we're
looking
for
in
this
case,
willie
peacock
and
the
13
people
that
were
arrested
with
him
is
a
fair
trial.
what
we
can't
get
in
mississippi
state
courts
is
a
fair
trial.
that
was
what
congress
had
on
its
mind
in
1866
when
it
passed
this
civil
rights
removal
bill.
this
civil
rights
removal
bill
was
the
third
part
of
the
first
civil
rights
act
and
it
simply
said
that
colored
people,
negroes
and
newly
freed
slaves
are
going
to
have
to
be
brought
up
to
the
level
of
a
white
man.
this
was
the
intent
of
the
39th
congress.
it
was
the
intent
of
the
fourteenth,
thirteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
it
was
the
philosophy
of
the
age
that
the
negro
was
going
to
be
brought
up
to
the
level
of
the
white
man
and
if
the
federal
power
was
going
to
see
to
it
that
this
happens.
and
what
happened
in
this
situation
was
they
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
it
said,
negroes
are
going
to
have
the
same
right
as
white
people
and
the
federal
government
is
going
to
see
to
it
that
if
any
of
these
rights
are
deprived,
people
can
be
prosecuted,
that
was
the
second
section
of
that
act.
the
third
section
said
if
there's
going
to
be
any
prosecution
of
these
negroes
and
the
unionists,
there's
going
to
be
removal
into
the
federal
courts
where
they
can
get
a
fair
trial.
everybody
knew
in
1866
that
the
negroes,
if
they
were
going
to
be
tried
by
these
reconstructionists
or
obstructionists
state
governments,
they
were
going
to
be
tried
by
ex-confederate
judges
and
that
the
negroes
weren't
going
to
get
a
fair
trial
and
that
any
white
man
in
the
south
that
took
the
union
calls
will
never
get
a
fair
trial.
that
was
true.
they
tried
to
rescue
slavery
in
mississippi
in
1865
and
they
just
barely
missed
it.
they
couldn't
repeal
it.
the
courts
that
freedmen's
courts
that
were
set
up
in
mississippi
phased
themselves
out
in
early
1865
so
that
there
was
no
longer
any
control
over
how
negroes
were
going
to
be
tried
and
there
was
no
review
of
the
method
about
which
they
were
going
to
be
tried.
the
same
things
that
that
congress
in
1866
was
talking
about,
is
in
mississippi
today.
it
was
in
mississippi
in
1964.
i
was
there.
that's
where
these
prosecutions
came
from.
negroes
and
civil
rights
workers
in
mississippi
are
not
going
to
get
fair
trials
in
those
state
courts
and
they
don't
get
them
because
they
don't
have
negroes
on
juries.
they
have
white
judges,
white
prosecutors,
white
jurymen,
white
sheriff
that
are
all
elected
by
white
electorates
from
which
negroes
are
eliminated.
negroes
are
gradually
getting
their
right
to
vote
under
the
new
act
but
they're
long
way
from
it.
there
are
nearly
400,000
negroes
that
i
think
are
eligible
to
vote
under
the
provisions
of
the
new
act
in
mississippi
and
there's
not
85,000
registered
yet.
the
whole
idea
of
the
mississippi
plan
of
1890
was
to
keep
negroes
off
those
juries
by
keeping
them
off
the
voting
rolls.
now
the
only
thing
that
we
say
is
that
the
congress
said
that
this
was
not
an
act
passed
in
1866
for
the
civil
rights
movement
or
for
civil
rights
people
just
about
themselves.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
don't
agree
with
the
previous
argument
that
this
was
an
act
passed
that
would
allow
removal
when
somebody
goes
out
and
does
something
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
does
something
consistent
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
say
it
was
passed
for
the
negro
who
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
in
the
state
court.
that
was
one
they
passed.
now
what
that
means
is
that
they're
going
to
send
--
under
this
interpretation,
their
recent
powers
put
on
this
thing,
they
can't
get
a
fair
trial
and
a
fair
federal
tribunal
unless
the
state
so
dumb
that
they
passed
an
act
that
says
negroes
can't
serve
on
the
juries.
and
no
state
--
no
southern
court
--
is
that
enough,
there's
no
southern
state
government
is
going
to
do
anything
like
that.
they've
learned
their
lesson.
the
whole
philosophy
here
was
that
the
legal
machinery
of
the
states,
the
reconstructive
states,
the
ex-confederate
state
was
that
they're
going
to
use
the
federal
power,
i
mean
the
state
power
to
prosecute
the
unionists
in
their
midst
and
the
negroes.
what
happened
after
the
civil
war
was
that
the
negroes
were
freed.
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them
roaming
the
south
without
any
education,
without
any
money,
without
any
jobs,
without
any
homes
and
they
passed
these
black
codes.
these
black
codes
are
just
about
like
the
slave
codes.
the
only
thing
that
it
didn't
have
is
it
didn't
say
slavery.
that
was
the
only
difference
and
the
negro
had
to
register.
he
had
to
have
a
labor
contract.
he
had
to
indenture
his
children.
he
had
to
pay
a
head
tax.
he
couldn't
move
around
without
a
travel
permit.
he
was
a
class
of
indentured
servants
and
when
he
was
prosecuted
for
not
doing
these
things,
the
federal
law
says
he
had
the
right
to
remove
them.
that's
what
that
second
section
of
1443
means
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor,
the
federal
officers
and
the
state
officers
are
trying
to
do
the
job.
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
if
we
don't
give
some
meaning
to
this
federal
removal
statute
then
there's
no
use
talking
about
equality.
if
a
man
is
going
to
--
what
they
were
going
to
do
and
what
they
did
do
and
what
they're
doing
in
mississippi
now
and
what
they're
doing
in
parts
of
louisiana
now
is
they're
prosecuting
people
for
civil
rights
activity
and
they
just
go
out
and
pick
up
a
negro
who
is
not
involved
in
the
civil
rights
movement,
he's
got
a
prosecution
against
him.
they
can't
get
a
fair
trial
because
they're
black
and
civil
rights
people
who
are
white
can
get
a
fair
trial
because
they're
coming
down
there
from
the
north
and
all
of
that.
so
what
they
do
is
in
trial
within
a
state
court
where
they've
got
a
built-in
decision
and
they
know
they're
going
to
convict
them.
no
lawyers
in
the
community
are
going
to
represent
them
because
it's
not
popular
to
do
that.
what
happens
is,
they
can't
get
a
proper
counsel
and
they
get
convicted
and
they
get
high
bail.
they
get
--
you've
got
two
cases
up
here
now
asking
for
certiorari
from
this
court.
one
is
baines,
that's
the
danville
case
and
one
is
bowman
out
of
montgomery,
out
of
[inaudible].
if
you
read
those
cases,
you'll
find
out
the
judge
comes
to
court
with
a
pistol,
if
a
searcher
by
walks
into
the
courtroom,
search
the
brief
cases,
search
the
persons,
there
are
policemen
standing
around
with
guns
on,
you
can't
get
a
fair
trial
in
that
kind
of
an
atmosphere.
that
was
what
the
whole
removal
statute
was
all
about
then.
i
would
have
been
able
to
show
you
something
like
that
too
if
the
district
judge
below
give
me
an
opportunity
to
get
a
hearing.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
want
to
be
able
to
take
deposition
that
i
can
show
than
in
leflore
county,
negroes
don't
serve
on
juries.
negroes
who
are
beat
up
and
shot
at
the
night,
they
were
arrested
when
they
try
to
register
to
vote,
that
was
what
they
were
doing
here.
they
were
--
what
happened
in
these
cases,
i'll
tell
you
what
willie
peacock
was
doing.
he
wasn't
trying
to
violate
the
law.
he
was
trying
to
see
if
the
law
was
followed.
he
wasn't
out
just
demonstrating
to
them
to
block
the
city
sidewalks.
they
found
that
if
they
wanted
negroes
to
register
so
as
to
in
an
orderly
fashion
change
the
policy
and
the
government
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
bring
it
into
the
20th
century
where
it
belongs
that
you're
going
to
have
to
have
negroes
register
and
vote
so
that
the
voting
processes
that
makes
this
country
great.
the
democratic
processes
of
a
vote
means
something
to
people
so
that
there
is
some
participation
in
government.
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do
and
they
found
that
if
they
went
to
a
negro
who
lived
on
a
farm
and
said,
uncle
or
aunt,
friend
or
brother,
whoever
it
was
miss
so
and
so,
mister
so
and
so,
come
on
down
and
vote
and
they're
going
to
say,
we're
scared
to
go
to
that
white
man's
courthouse.
i'll
tell
you
when
i
was
getting
into
that.
that's
just
a
big
white
man's
courthouse.
that's
all
the
law
means
to
me.
he
just
got
a
bad
yawn
and
you
better
look
out.
don't
hang
around
there.
that's
just
where
you
pay
your
taxes.
so
what
the
civil
rights
workers
were
saying
was,
okay
if
you're
scared
to
go,
we'll
go
with
you
and
we'll
be
there
with
you
and
we'll
show
them
that
if
we
have
the
courage
to
go
with
you,
maybe
you'll
have
the
courage
to
go
down
and
vote.
so
what
they
do
is
they
put
on
a
freedom
day
and
they
marched
around
that
courthouse
with
a
sign
which
says
“one
man,
one
vote”
or
something
about
voting
and
the
negroes
would
trickle
into
that
registrar's
office.
and
the
police
would
come
down
and
say
you're
blocking
the
sidewalk
and
throw
everybody
in
jail.
that's
what
was
going
on.
that's
what
was
going
on
all
over
mississippi.
throw
them
in
jail
and
try
them
the
next
day.
we
have
to
file
this
removal
petition
in
peacock.
drew
it
up
one
night
and
went
up
to
mississippi
the
next
day
to
stop
the
trials
during
that
day
because
they
were
going
to
trial.
so
all
i'm
saying
to
you
gentlemen
is
that
that
was
what
we
were
talking
about
when
we
passed
this
thing
by
the
39th
congress
and
there's
no
getting
around
it.
if
you're
going
to
tell
the
negro
and
asked
what
it
was
passed
for,
if
you're
going
to
tell
and
he's
got
equal
civil
rights,
don't
tell
him
and
then
kid
him
about
it.
give
him
some
opportunity
to
enforce
these
civil
rights
and
to
protect
himself
and
to
get
a
fair
trial.
now
in
maybe
four
or
five,
ten
years,
when
the
negro
gets
to
vote
in
the
south
like
i
hopefully
think
he's
going
to
get
it,
then
maybe
he'll
be
able
to
elect
some
judges
and
some
sheriffs
and
maybe
he'll
be
able
to
get
on
some
jury
rolls,
but
right
now,
he
can't
do
it.
only
in
a
very
few
areas
do
you
find
them
serving
on
jury.
so
if
you're
going
to
give
him
the
franchise
and
you
know
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957,
1960,
1964
and
1965,
you
go
out
in
these
country
parishes
in
louisiana
and
these
country
counties
in
mississippi,
they
don't
know
where
it
is.
they
haven't
seen
it.
it
hadn't
changed
their
lives
any.
they
still
don't
go
to
the
courthouse
and
vote.
they
still
don't
get
their
roads
pay.
they
still
don't
have
any
participation
in
the
government.
they're
still
afraid
of
the
sheriff
because
he's
a
white
man's
law.
and
the
thing
about
it
is,
he
doesn't
know
that
there's
a
federal
presence
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
it
doesn't
touch
him.
now
it
might
touch
somebody
in
jackson,
but
that's
it.
what
we
got
to
do
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
what
you
have
to
do
is
like
the
statute
says.
it
says
a
clear
concise
brief
statement
of
what's
going
on
and
peacock,
i
admit,
i
do
this
pretty
hastily
at
night
trying
to
get
it
up
there
and
stop
these
things.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
short,
brief,
concise
statement
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
--
of
the
grounds
upon
which
you
remove
but
i
think
if
you
track
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
think
if
you
simply
make
the
allegation
like
i
did
in
peacock
that
you've
been
deprived
of
certain
constitutional
rights
and
i
said,
you've
been
deprived
of
the
right
--
is
denied,
i'm
saying
denied.
i
think
that's
the
operative
language,
is
denied
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
laws
and
the
due
process
of
the
laws
in
as
much
as
other
things
he
was
arrested,
charged
and
he's
to
be
tried
under
state
statute
that
is
unconstitutional
and
unconstitutionally
applied.
i
think
that's
enough
to
show
denial.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
was
saying
that
the
statute,
to
be
frank
with
you
in
the
peacock
case,
i
think
that
i
had
reference
to
the
statute
under
which
he
was
being
charged
this
courthouse
picketing
statute,
not
courthouse
picketing
but
the
blocking
the
sidewalk
statute.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
but
i
think
that
it
can
be
reasonably
inferred
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
was
also
talking
about
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
be
tried
under
a
system
of
strict
racial
segregation
because
in
that
paragraph
by
saying
this
statute
is
vague
and
definitely
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
it's
unconstitutional
and
arbitrarily
applied
and
used
and
is
enforced
in
this
instance
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
unconstitutional
and
strict
policy
of
racial
segregation
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
the
city
of
greenwood.
now
that's
all
i
said
and
then
i
said,
he
was
being
--
i
said
he
is
not
only
not
guilty
but
he
cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
mississippi
the
rights
he
possesses
providing
for
the
equal
rights
of
citizens
of
united
states
nor
can
he
act
under
authority
of
the
four
mentioned
provisions
providing
for
equal
protection
of
the
rights
and
i
cite
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
my
thoughts
on
the
procedure
would
be
that
if
i
have
to
defend
that,
if
i
was
the
removing
petitioner,
i'd
sit
down
and
institute
a
hearing
on
the
jury
selection
process
in
that
county
and
i'd
also
call
in
the
sheriff
and
i'd
call
in
the
law
enforcement
official.
we
did
this
in
the
retrial
of
the
cameron
case
which
this
court
sent
back
to
us
to
retrial.
we
tried
it
over
biloxi
in
last
october.
you
also
said
he
wanted
a
better
record
in
that
case
and
so
we
retried
it
and
what
we
did
was
we
put
the
prosecutor
on
the
stand
and
i
said
to
the
prosecutor
for
example,
here,
you're
arresting
people
for
parading
around
the
county
courthouse
in
forrest
county,
mississippi.
i
said,
what
about
the
football
parade
that
you
have
in
town.
you
know,
it's
just
as
bad
to
block
the
courthouse
for
those
football
parade
as
it
is
to
blocking
with
the
sign
that
says
“one
man
one
vote”.
he
said,
“well,
that's
a
football
parade.
you
know,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.”
i
said,
“well
these
people
are
just
as
serious
of
what
they're
talking
about
as
you
are
with
your
football
parades
and
you
admit
that
it
blocks
the
courthouse,
this
is
selective
enforcement
of
the
statute
which
was
condemned
in
cox
versus
louisiana.”
so
as
to
the
kind
of
hearing
that
i
would
undertake
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
show
that
kind
of
selective
enforcement.
i
would
show
that
negroes
don't
serve
on
the
jury
and
i'd
show
to
the
federal
court
by
these
experiences
of
useful
--
using
the
federal
rules
to
develop
a
record,
i'll
show
that
he
could
not
enforce
in
the
courts
of
that
state
equal
civil
right
of
having
a
fair
trial.
and
once
i've
done
that,
i
would
say,
“okay,
now
we
try
the
case
in
the
federal
court
where
you'll
get
a
fair
trial”
which
is
what
this
thing
is
all
about
anyway.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
sir.
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that.
i
think
this
act
was
passed
to
cover
the
prosecution
of
negroes
in
an
unfair
atmosphere.
that's
what
the
congress
in
1866
had
in
their
mind.
justice
black
mentioned
something
about
prosecuting
negroes
in
watson,
new
york
and
i
think
that's
where
it
came
up.
i
think
that
if
they're
denied
a
fair
trial,
if
they
can't
enforce
in
those
courts,
if
the
arrest
is
racially
motivated,
if
the
trial
is
going
to
be
stacked
in
the
deck
against
them
as
mr.
lott
says,
i
don't
care
if
you
live
in
watson,
new
york.
i
still
think
they're
entitled
to
removal.
it
just
so
happens
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
and
we're
talking
about
the
states
of
the
rebellion
and
so
i
don't
agree
with
that
previous
counsel
about
that
point.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
right.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
we've
got
that
problem
in
louisiana
where
it's
probably
a
racial
crime.
we
don't
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
it
could
arguably.
yes
sir,
i
really
do.
i
think
that
that
was
what
we've
talked
about
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir
and
it
might
work
out.
that
is
a
matter
of
judicial
administration
too
because
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
that's
right.
we
--
i
just
can't
see
in
a
situation
like
where
we're
really
talking
about
the
development
of
the
judicial
administration
why
we
can't
remove
these
cases
and
get
this
question
of
discrimination
on
jury
as
a
trial
to
go
over
with
on
the
first
level
when
--
rather
than
this
habeas
corpus
up
and
down
like
a
yo-yo
thing.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
i
don't
see
the
basis
for
those
cases.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you've
got
to
--
i
think
those
are
the
same
kind
of
cases
you
overruled
when
you
overruled
plessy.
i
think
they
have
a
same
indication
when
they
still
didn't
compromise
came
out
that
sold
out
the
negro
in
the
south
by
removing
those
reconstruction
governments
and
putting
the
texas
pacific
railway
through
the
country.
that
was
sealing
the
faith
of
the
negro.
plessy
versus
ferguson
was
just
an
aspect
of
it
just
as
in
these
cases
it's
an
aspect
of
it
too.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i'd
try
the
case
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well
after
a
man
is
charged
for
example
with
rape
or
murder
and
he
is
indicted.
now
the
only
real
question
is
whether
he
is
going
to
get
a
fair
trial
that
he
is
involved
--
not
involved
in
any
civil
rights
work.
but
if
it's
a
civil
rights
case
and
for
example
in
the
rachel
case,
if
i
would
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
in
this
case
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
more
than
you'd
be
doing
it
by
walking
down
the
sidewalk
yourself.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
will
be
a
dismissal
there.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
it
would
be
a
dismissal
there.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
i
can't
understand
the
previous
counsel
talking
about
sending
it
back
for
trial
in
the
state
court
when
that's
the
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
oh!
yes.
well,
if
it
was
a
proper
application.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
you
mean
if
the
judge
found
there
was
no
state
discrimination
and
he
was
affirmed
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
then
i
think
the
state
court
would
be
the
proper
forum.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
that's
right,
but
all
we're
looking
for
is
a
fair
trial.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
wouldn't
put
the
state
court
on
trial
anymore
than
the
recusation
statute
to
do
now.
in
other
words,
i
think
we
call
them
recusation
statutes
in
louisiana
where
the
judge
can
be
recused
for
prejudice
and
interest
in
the
case.
if
you
have
to
show
that
that
prejudice
is
racial
then
i
think
that
you
have
the
right
to
do
it
but
i
would
not
put
the
state
court
on
trial
anymore
than
that
recusation
statute
does.
and
as
far
as
the
prosecutor
is
concerned,
unless
there
is
a
statute
that
relates
to
that,
i
don't
know
that
i
want
to
go
into
the
motivation
of
the
prosecutor.
now
i
might
want
to
go
under
the
motivation
of
the
arresting
officer
because
that
would
indicate
what
was
going
on
at
the
scene,
but
segregation
as
prosecutor
theoretically
can
prosecute
impartially.
i
assume
the
--
if
he
operates
it
under
his
oath
with
the
judge.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
go
ahead,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
i
think
if
you
--
you
have
to
--
if
you
have
a
chance
to
read
the
application
in
baines
versus
the
city
of
danville
and
forman
versus
the
city
of
montgomery
which
is
up
before
you
i
think
for
some
decision,
you're
going
to
find
that
the
atmosphere
created
in
the
baines
courtroom,
if
the
allegations
in
the
application
are
correct,
was
such
that
anyone
looking
at
it
could
tell
in
a
minute
you
weren't
going
to
get
a
fair
trial.
now
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
that,
you
can
avoid
doing
something
about
that.
now
i
don't
want
to
try
to
crawl
inside
a
man's
mind
and
find
out
how
he
feels
about
race,
but
where
you've
got
external
objected
manifestations
of
a
reign
of
terror
and
the
absolute
absence
of
justice
or
the
possibility
of
justice,
i
think
you
ought
have
to
be
able
to
inquire
into
that.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
it's
just
as
important
because
if
you
take
a
negro
in
the
south
is
charged
and
one
of
this
country
parishes
or
counties
where
no
negroes
have
ever
served
and
we
held
a
hearing
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
december,
but
we
have
five
or
seven
cases
button
case
and
a
whole
bunch
of
others.
i
have
that
button
case
and
we
showed
every
one
of
these
country
parishes
where
no
negroes
would
ever
serve
on
the
jury.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
and
we
know
about
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
so.
i
think
that
you
just
have
to
face
facts
that
he
is
not
going
to
get
a
fair
trial
either.
there
was
a
georgia
case
that
came
out
on
that.
i
forget
the
name
of
it
but
it
was
a
case
in
which
they
said
that
there
would
be
--
the
civil
rights
worker
was
white
and
he
said
he
was
being
deprived
of
this
fourteenth
amendment
right's
equal
protection
i
think
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
it
might
have
been.
actually
two
in
this
case
are
white.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
two
in
peacock
case
are
white.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
right.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
so.
i
think
where
you
find
that
the
atmosphere
in
these
areas,
rural
areas
particularly
just
forbids
a
fair
trial
because
of
a
racial
bias,
regardless
of
whether
the
defendants
colored
or
white,
then
you've
got
to
recognize
that
that
was
what
this
thing
was
talking
about.
i
think
the
act
is
going
to
phase
itself
out
as
the
society
becomes
more
homogenous
where
the
negroes
participate
in
this
political
life
of
the
south
which
is
what
we're
all
been
looking
for,
for
years
and
then
the
emergency
necessity
of
such
an
interruption
of
a
state
judicial
process
will
pass
out
the
picture
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
federal
government
ought
to
interpose
itself
into
the
state's
affairs
if
the
state
can
give
people
fair
trials
and
that's
what
we're
after.
these
fair
trial
rights
are
federal
rights
and
if
the
state
government
has
the
right
--
has
the
obligation
under
the
supremacy
clause
to
enforce
these
federal
rights
and
they're
given
the
first
opportunity
to
do
it.
if
they
don't
want
to
do
it,
if
they
refuse
to
do
it,
if
they
want
to
use
the
machinery
of
the
state
to
suppress
people
that
are
trying
to
exercise
these
rights
then
they
forfeited
the
right
to
claim
states
rights
and
they're
going
to
forfeit
it
until
they
bring
the
state
governments
into
order
so
that
they
can
say
that
on
the
state
level,
we
obey
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
and
people
in
our
state
colored
and
white
get
a
fair
trial.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
the
language
is
pretty
broad
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i'm
relying
upon
a
lot
of
the
history.
i
think
you
can
find
a
lot
of
this
in
the
brief
but
you
say
in
it
--
you
see,
i'm
relying
on
--
i
can't
just
judge
sobeloff
reading
of
the
first
section
as
he
has
it
in
the
baines
dissent.
i
say
where
the
prosecution
is
against
any
person
who
is
denied
a
right
and
i
skip
there
as
a
right
under
any
law
providing
for
the
equal
civil
rights
of
citizens
and
if
he
is
denied
it,
i
think
he's
denied
it
by
a
racially
motivated
arrest
and
that's
what
justice
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
sir?
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no,
i
don't
think
that
apply
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
i
really
don't.
no.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
don't
think
that
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
rely
upon
the
second
part
there
that
says,
“cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
such
state
against
any
person
who
cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
such
state,
a
right
under
any
law
providing
for
the
equal
civil
rights
of
citizens.”
now
an
accused
rapist
or
an
accused
murderer
who
is
not
arrested
because
he's
a
civil
rights
worker
but
because
he
may
have
committed
a
crime,
i
think
if
he
can't
get
a
fair
trial
before
nondiscriminatory
to
select
a
jury
then
he
ought
to
be
able
to
remove
it.
that's
the
only
grounds
i
think
he'd
have.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
willie
peacock
and
his
group,
i
say
in
the
second
part
of
my
brief
that
they
were
possibly
commentators
too.
but
we
found
there
was
that
the
1964
civil
rights
act
had
been
--
well,
it
hadn't
been
passed
but
two
voting
rights
acts
so
one
of
1957
and
the
one
of
1960
had
been
passed
and
these
would
have
encouraged
negro
registration
and
that's
what
peacock
was
out
there
trying
to
do.
and
i
say
if
he
was
out
there
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
an
interview
with
mr.
katzenbach
the
other
day
by
mr.
kanues
and
they
talked
about,
i
think
mr.
kanues
said
to
mr.
katzenbach,
“isn't
there
some
obligation
on
the
federal
government
to
incur
the
registration
and
not
just
make
certain
that
facilities
are
available,”
says
kanues
and
this
is
what
mr.
katzenbach
said.
he
said,
“no.
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
federal
government
to
uphold
the
law.
my
interpretation
of
the
law
is
that
civil
rights
groups
in
this
case
have
to
put
on
the
drive
to
get
people
to
register.”
now
if
he
is
going
to
say
that
then
these
civil
rights
workers
have
some
protection
coming
to
them
and
i
think
they
have
the
protection
of
this
removal
statute.
it
says
they
can
remove.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir,
you've
asked
me
about
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
no
sir.
i
don't
disassociate.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
i
make
a
pretty
good
argument
on
that
posse
comitatus
--
comitatus.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
but
i
don't
disassociate
myself
from
the
solicitor
general's
position
in
this
case
which
i
think
is
a
very
well
reasoned
argument
which
mr.
claiborne
will
bring
out
after
i
finish
about
how
it
applies
to
everybody.
now
i
do
have
one
little
argument
at
the
end
of
my
brief
about
the
fact
that
this
last
language
for
refusing
to
do
any
act
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
such
law,
they
want
to
restrict
the
act
there
to
just
apply
to
the
state
officer
who
for
example
is
supposed
to
be
fair
to
negroes
being
prosecuted.
i
say
it
applies
to
all
the
negroes
who
are
being
prosecuted
for
failing
to
do
so
--
actually
in
1866,
failing
to
do
something
on
those
black
codes.
because
the
black
codes
were
enacted
in
mississippi
in
november
of
1865,
this
act
was
passed
in
april
of
1866
and
the
black
codes
were
effective
january
29th,
1866
and
the
black
codes
--
the
negro
just
have
to
sit
around
in
his
living
room
and
do
nothing
then
he's
violating
about
ten
of
them.
so
he'd
be
prosecuted
for
it
and
he
had,
i
think,
under
this
last
paragraph,
last
sent
--
phrase
of
the
last
paragraph
the
right
to
remove
those
prosecution.
that's
my
theory.
now
i
don't
find
a
whole
lot
of
history
behind
that
but
that's
--
at
least
that's
my
feeling
of
what
was
happening
inside.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i've
got
a
case
right
now
where
a
civil
rights
worker
registered
to
vote
in
forrest
county,
mississippi
and
he
filled
out
his
registration
form
and
only
that
it
says
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
any
crime?”
he
said
no
he's
been
convicted
about
four
of
them.
now
that
posed
a
heck
of
a
problem
to
me.
he
had
pleaded
guilty
without
a
counsel
to
three
or
four
of
them
and
it
was
just
a
mess,
but
i
removed
that
case
and
i
think
i
removed
it
not
because
he
was
arrested
for
doing
something
in
the
civil
rights
field
and
that
is
even
trying
to
register
to
vote.
i
removed
it
because
negroes
don't
serve
on
juries
in
forrest
county,
mississippi
and
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
of
a
perjury
charge
that
carried
a
long
sentence
with
it
in
forrest
county,
mississippi
and
that's
why
i
removed
it.
that's
the
only
reason
i
removed
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
--
you
mean
if
they've
act
--
they
may
have
actually
committed
a
crime
in
the
process
of
protected
activity.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
don't
think
that
just
because
they're
doing
civil
rights
work
makes
them
immune
from
the
prosecution
(voice
overlap)
i
think
they'd
be
prosecuted.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
they
would
have
to
be
prosecuted.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
it
depends
if
they're
going
to
go
to
--
i
don't
want
to
one
of
those
state
juries
now.
i
want
to
be
prosecuted
before
a
jury
this
fair.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i'm
afraid
i'd
have
to.
some
of
them
don't
have
jury
just
to
worth
the
name.
you
don't
--
i
don't
know.
it
sounds
rather
extreme
mr.
justice
white
but
some
of
the
problems
you
face
and
some
of
those
counties
are
pretty
extreme
too.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
it
have
to
be
tried.
i
don't
think
you
could
dismiss
it.
i
think
it
have
to
be
tried.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
in
the
federal
court
to
get
a
fair
forum
unless
there
was
a
fair
state
forum
but
not
just
because
they
were
involved
in
protected
activities
and
then
overstepped
the
boundaries
is
not
going
to
--
i
don't
think
that
you
can
protect
them
any
further.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir,
it
would
be.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
i
will
say
again
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
don't
think
this
act
was
tailor-made
for
a
civil
rights
movement.
i
think
it
was
tailor-made
for
the
--
to
raise
the
negro
up
to
the
level
of
the
white
man
giving
them
a
fair
forum.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
now
maybe
congress
shouldn't
have
done
it.
maybe
they
shouldn't
have
passed
it
in
1866.
maybe
this
will
burden
the
federal
courts
but
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
think
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
the
history
--
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
see
it
removed
if
you
had
due
process
as
the
question
but
i
don't
think
that's
historically
correct.
i
think
that
white
people
involved
in
this
thing,
you've
got
to
use
the
injunction
like
we
used
in
dombrowski.
i
think
that
that's
really
the
answer
there
as
we
try
to
use
in
cameron.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes.
i'll
be
--
i've
tried
it
to
labor
union,
i
didn't
get
anywhere.
i
did
it
long
time
ago
and
i
didn't
get
anywhere.
i
don't
think
historically
that
they're
entitled
to
use
it.
i
wish
they
were.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
and
they
ought
to
be
entitle
--
in
addition
to
that
--
yes
sir,
in
answer
your
question
then
in
addition
to
that,
they're
ought
to
be
entitled
to
keep
that
case
in
the
federal
court
if
they
can
prove
their
allegations.
if
they
can't
prove
the
allegations,
they're
ought
to
bounce
them
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i'm
getting
a
lot
of
opposition
from
lawyers
generally
and
from
this
court.
i
can
see
on
this
question
of
how
widespread
is
going
to
be
the
effect
of
this
act.
if
i
started
telling
you
that
it
was
going
to
go
to
equal
--
due
process
of
law
then
somebody
is
going
to
start
saying,
you're
going
to
institute
a
federal
system
with
courts
for
the
whole
50
states.
now
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
that
morass
because
i'm
up
here
trying
to
give
it
some
historical
meaning.
it
could
be
interpreted
that
way
sir
but
i
just
don't
think
that
in
all
practicality,
i'd
be
doing
my
case
any
good
to
argue
that.
i
think
if
there's
no
question,
that's
all
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
claiborne.
