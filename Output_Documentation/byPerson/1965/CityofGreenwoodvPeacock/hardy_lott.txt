mr.
hardy
lott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
peacock
and
13
others
filed
a
removal
petition
in
the
federal
district
court,
alleging
that
they
were
being
prosecuted
in
a
police
court
of
the
city
of
greenwood
for
blocking
public
streets.
the
district
court
remanded
the
cases
to
the
police
court
on
the
face
of
the
petition.
they
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
held
that
the
allegations
of
the
petition
were
sufficient,
if
proved,
to
make
other
case
for
removal
under
the
first
section
of
28
u.s.c.
1443
and
they
reversed
the
case
and
remanded
it
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
court
to
hear
evidence
to
see
if
peacock
and
those
could
prove
the
allegations
of
their
petition.
the
peacock
petition
alleges
very
little
about
the
substance
of
the
allegations
are
--
that
peacock
--
the
petitions
are
identical
so
only
one
is
in
the
record.
the
allegations
are
that
peacock
is
a
member
of
the
student
non-violent
coordinating
committee
which
is
associated
with
cofo
and
that
they
were
engaged
in
civil
rights
work
in
assisting
negroes
to
register
to
vote.
they
then
alleged
that
they
were
arrested
for
blocking
public
streets.
they
draw
the
conclusion
and
make
the
conclusionary
allegation
that
because,
well
first,
that
the
statute
is
being
applied
to
them
in
support
of
a
policy
of
segregation
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
city
of
greenwood.
they
then
make
the
conclusionary
allegation
that
because
of
their
prosecution,
because
of
the
above
that
they
are
denied
and
cannot
enforce
in
court
the
equal
rights
of
citizens
under
the
constitution
in
42
u.s.c.
1971.
now
the
other
cases
were
combined
here.
those
came
along
later,
there
were
15
defendants.
they
alleged
prosecution
in
the
police
court
of
greenwood
for
various
offenses
on
different
dates,
assault
and
battery,
driving
a
car
with
an
improper
license,
reckless
driving,
matters
of
that
kind.
the
district
court
did
the
same
thing
with
those
cases,
remanded
them
on
the
face
of
the
petition.
they
came
up
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
later
in
the
peacock
case
so
that
there
was
no
briefing
and
no
argument
in
that
case.
they
sustained
a
summary
motion
to
reverse
on
the
ground
that
it
was
controlled
by
peacock.
now
what
we
were
concerned
with
here
in
the
peacock
case
is
the
removal
statute,
1443.
now
it's
settled
law
that
this
court
only
has
such
jurisdiction
in
the
removal
case
as
congress
has
conferred
upon
it,
as
conferred
upon
the
federal
courts
and
the
question
here
is
what
jurisdiction
congress
can
put
by
the
first
section
of
1443.
now
that
section
gives
a
person
a
right
to
remove
in
a
civil
or
criminal
prosecution,
brought
against
any
person
who
is
denied
or
cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
such
state,
a
right
on
any
law
providing
for
the
equal
rights
of
citizens
of
united
states.
now
the
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
in
that
is
what
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
overlooked
is
the
language
in
that
statute
“who
is
denied
or
cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
such
statement.”
now
the
statute
provides
that
in
order
to
remove,
you
have
to
file
your
removal
petition
before
the
trial.
so
--
that
this
court
has
held
that
being
true
and
that's
the
statute,
you
have
to
allege
facts
in
advance
of
a
trial
to
show
that
in
the
state
court,
you
will
be
denied
or
cannot
enforce
some
equal
civil
right.
this
court
therefore
held
in
eight
cases
mentioned
in
the
previous
argument
beginning
with
strauder
versus
west
virginia
and
virginia
versus
rives
on
the
same
date
and
going
down
through
kentucky
versus
powers
that
since
that
is
true
that
you
have
to
file
your
petition
and
allege
and
show
in
advance
that
you're
going
to
be
denied
or
cannot
enforce
an
equal
civil
right
in
court.
that
therefore,
it
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
by
that
statute
to
take
care
of
any
deprivation
of
rights
that
might
come
up
on
the
trial
for
the
first
time
because
you
wouldn't
know
that
until
it
happened.
that
you
had
to
be
able
to
point
it
in
advance
that
you
would
be
denied
or
can
enforce
in
the
courts
of
a
state
an
equal
civil
right
and
that
the
only
way
you
could
do
that
is
where
there
was
a
statute
or
constitutional
provision
of
the
state
which
if
the
state
court
followed
would
obligate
it
to
deny
use
on
the
equal
civil
right.
now
in
the
absence
of
that,
this
court
has
held
in
those
eight
cases
or
in
the
last
seven
at
least,
that
you
can't
remove
underneath
that
statute.
they
specifically
held
that
if
a
subordinate
officer
undertakes
to
deprive
a
defendant
of
his
equal
civil
rights
in
advance
of
trial
by
a
person
who
is
stacking
the
grand
jury,
refusing
to
put
anybody
on
the
grand
jury
if
it's
colored
defendant
except
white
people,
that
doesn't
show
that
he
is
going
to
be
denied
or
can't
enforce
his
equal
civil
rights
in
the
state
court
because
the
presumption
is
that
the
court
will
correct
that.
that
if
it's
a
matter
of
stacking
the
grand
jury
that
the
court
when
the
trial
comes
on
will
sustain
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
if
it's
a
matter
of
petit
jury,
the
same
thing.
so
that
this
court
held
and
it
seems
to
me
they
were
obligated
to
do
it
under
the
statute,
but
in
any
event,
they
held
it
eight
times
that
you
couldn't
remove
underneath
the
statute
without
showing
in
advance
that
you're
going
to
be
denied
or
couldn't
enforce
your
rights
in
state
court
and
that
the
only
way
you
could
show
that
is
if
there
was
a
constitutional
provision
or
statute
of
the
state
which
if
followed
by
the
state
court
would
have
that
result.
now
that
--
those
decisions
have
been
criticized
by
those
who
want
more
removal
on
the
ground
that
is
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
statute.
well
it
doesn't
seem
that
way
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
went
pretty
far
when
it
held
that
they
weren't
go
and
presume
that
the
state
court
would
do
what
it
should
do
and
disregard
an
invalid
state
statute
and
follow
the
paramount
federal
law.
but
that
they
would
indulge
in
the
presumption
that
the
state
court
being
bound
by
state
law
if
there
was
a
state
statute
or
constitutional
provision
that
they
would
say
the
state
court
was
going
to
follow
it
and
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
that
presumption
and
permit
him
to
remove.
now
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
we
submit
with
difference,
completely
overlooked
that
portion
of
the
statute
in
the
peacock
case.
that
is
the
portion
that
the
denial
or
inability
enforced
has
got
to
be
in
court
and
they
completely,
in
our
opinion,
disregarded
the
eight
decisions
of
this
court
to
that
effect.
what
they
held
in
the
peacock
case
was
that
the
very
institution
of
the
prosecution
would
enable
you
to
remove
on
allegation
that
the
prosecution
was
instituted
for
an
improper
motive
to
deprive
use
of
civil
rights.
in
other
words,
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
was
this
that
in
this
case
where
the
arrest
and
charges
were
made
by
a
policemen
and
i
believe
the
alleged
policemen
and
officers
of
the
county,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
was
sufficient
if
an
allegation
that
they
were
made
by
them
for
an
improper
motive
to
arrest
them
and
exercise
of
their
civil
rights.
now
the
statute
doesn't
allege
--
i
mean
the
removal
petition
doesn't
contain
such
an
allegation
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
applied
this
notice
type
pleading
doctrine
and
said
they
would
infer
that
that's
what
the
peacock
and
all
of
those
would
contend.
so
they
held
that
the
mere
institution
of
the
prosecution
by
a
policemen
was
sufficient
to
remove.
now
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
and
logic,
we
submit
that
the
institution
of
a
prosecution
or
the
making
of
a
charge
or
an
improper
charge,
if
you
please,
by
a
policemen,
does
not
show
that
you're
deprived
or
cannot
enforce
your
rights
in
state
court.
as
held
by
this
court,
the
presumption
is
if
there's
something
improper
in
there,
if
he's
brought
a
charge
that
he
should
not
have
brought,
the
presumption
is
that
the
state
court
will
sustain
you
and
as
such
there's
no
way
to
say
that
the
charge
by
a
policemen
means,
it's
a
proof
that
you're
denied
or
can't
enforce
your
rights
in
a
state
court.
now
if
you
replace
the
thing.
suppose
that
some
federal
marshal
may
enforce
arrest
or
arrest
a
man
with
safe
and
improper
motive,
that
certainly
no
proof
that
you
are
denied
or
can
enforce
your
equal
civil
rights
in
the
federal
court
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
a
policeman,
but
in
any
event,
whether
it's
true
or
not,
this
court
has
so
held.
now
this
court
so
held
in
seven
cases
that
where
a
subordinate
state
officer
packed
the
grand
jury
by
illegally
excluding
colored
persons
from
the
grand
jury
and
also
the
petit
jury
that
the
case
was
not
removed.
now
in
that
case,
a
charge
was
brought
by
a
grand
jury
that
it
was
improperly
selected
in
violation
of
federal
law
and
packed
and
they
brought
the
charge.
this
court
held
in
those
seven
cases
that
that
case
was
not
removal
because
that
did
not
show
that
you
were
denied
or
couldn't
enforce
your
rights
in
state
court
that
the
presumption
was
a
state
court
would
enforce
your
rights
and
would
quash
the
indictment
as
a
whole.
now
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
peacock
is
no
doubt
about
their
holding.
if
you'll
read
their
opinion
carefully,
it's
hard
to
believe
that
they
even
realized
that
this
denial
and
enforcement
had
to
be
in
the
state
court.
in
any
event,
they
came
out
with
just
a
flat
holding
that
a
prosecution
for
an
improper
motive
instituted
to
deprive
you
of
your
civil
rights
made
out
a
case
of
removal.
mr.
hardy
lott
your
honor,
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
but
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
hardy
lott
this
court
in
seven
cases,
in
seven
straight
cases
have
held
that
statute
the
denial
and
inability
to
enforce
relief
to
the
state
court.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
mr.
hardy
lott
now
in
which
one
--
yes
sir.
now
in
each
one
of
those
seven
cases
that
i'm
talking
about,
the
man
had
been
deprived
of
his
equal
civil
rights
by
stacking
the
grand
jury
on
and
it
didn't
relate
to
a
court,
those
cases,
all
seven
of
them
would
have
been
removed,
but
this
court
held
that
that
language
and
you
can
read
it
that
way,
applies
to
the
court.
now
let
me
say
this.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
sustain
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
peacock
case
for
these
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
if
you
do,
you
would
have
to
overrule
seven
decisions.
you
have
to
overrule
that
part
of
the
decision
holding
that
under
subsection
(1)
the
denial
or
inability
to
enforce
had
to
be
shown
by
a
state
statute
or
constitutional
provision.
you
would
have
to
overrule
that.
you
would
have
to
overrule
your
own
opinions
in
those
seven
cases
that
the
acts
of
state
officers
in
depriving
you
of
your
rights
in
advance
of
trial
were
not
sufficient
for
removal
because
the
presumption
is
the
state
court
will
correct
it.
now
those
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
in
effect
and
have
been
a
settled
law
since
at
least
1879.
during
that
period
of
time,
congress
has
not
made
any
significant
changes
in
the
wording
of
that
statute
that
would
affect
those
decisions
and
congress
having
conferred
the
removal
of
jurisdiction
and
having
acquiesced
in
that
interpretation
since
at
least
1879.
i
submit
that
it
will
be
too
late
now
to
come
in
for
this
statute
--
i
mean
for
this
court
to
do
what
congress
has
failed
to
do
and
that
is
to
amend
the
statute
and
that's
what
he's
arguing
you
should
do.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
i
want
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
this
that
in
considering
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
congress
had
previously
reenacted
this
statute
a
number
of
times
without
changing
the
word.
in
1964,
they
have
their
specific
attention
directed
to
it
in
1964.
they
amended
the
companion
statute
that
enabled
you
to
appeal
from
a
remand
order
under
1443.
prior
to
that,
you
couldn't
appeal
so
congress
had
its
particular
attention
directed
to
it
and
made
the
amendment
permitting
an
appeal
from
a
remand
order
in
a
civil
rights
case
under
1443.
now
in
that
same
session
of
congress,
i
found
out
that
two
of
the
lawyers
whose
names
assigned
to
the
brief
of
peacock,
appeared
before
congress
and
advocated
the
amendment
of
that
statute.
and
mr.
[inaudible]
introduced
it
and
his
citation
is
in
the
reply
brief
of
peacock.
a
statute
before
congress
to
amend
that
statute
and
make
it
do
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
peacock
it
did
do.
and
that
is
to
make
any
denial
of
right
whether
by
a
court
or
administrative
officer
or
whatnot
removed.
now
congress
didn't
do
that.
congress
failed
to
pass
that
statute
in
1964.
so
--
mr.
hardy
lott
i
don't
know
sir.
all
i
know
it
was
introduced
and
i
read
it
in
the
record
and
it
didn't
pass,
it
didn't
come
out.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
mr.
hardy
lott
i
don't
know
sir.
i
do
know
that
there
was
a
testimony
before
the
house
committee
because
i
read
the
hearings
about
this
particular
bill
and
two
of
the
gentlemen
here
appeared
and
even
mentioned
--
mr.
hardy
lott
i
don't
know
that
either
sir,
but
the
fact
that
i'm
getting
at
is
that
congress
since
1879
has
not
amended
that
statute,
has
reenacted
it
and
therefore
it
appears
to
us,
it
certainly
endorsed
the
opinions
of
this
court
which
have
been
settled
law
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
this
as
a
practical
matter.
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
the
peacock
case
lays
down
a
bad
rule
and
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
those
seven
cases
are
good
rules.
they're
not
only
good
because
they
follow
the
statute
and
after
all,
that's
the
question
here.
is
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
hardy
lott
i
think
under
the
liberal
interpretation
given
this
statute
by
this
court
in
those
seven
cases,
you
would
say
that
the
state
court
would
follow,
you
just
presume
the
state
court
would
follow
that
state
statute
and
therefore
you'd
say
that
you
could
remove.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
that's
what
these
seven
cases
hold.
they
say
that
that's
the
only
time
and
i
think
that's
the
liberal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
hardy
lott
no
sir,
but
they
said
this
that
in
any
case
in
which
you
could
point
to
a
state
constitutional
provision
or
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
or
as
reasonably
read
which
would
cause
--
if
the
state
court
followed
it,
would
cause
you
to
be
denied
or
unable
to
enforce
your
equal
civil
right
that
then
the
case
was
removable.
mr.
hardy
lott
no
sir,
certainly
not.
mr.
hardy
lott
and
follow
the
state
statute.
that's
the
interpretation
put
on
by
this
court
in
those
seven
cases.
now
in
peacock
of
course
we
don't
have
any
such
statute.
there's
no
legislative
denial.
the
statute
against
blocking
public
streets,
applies
to
everyone
alike.
there's
no
--
nothing
in
peacock
to
show
that
he
can't
get
his
rights
so
that
he
will
be
denied
them
in
state
court.
now
as
i
was
saying,
one
reason
that
that's
the
bad
rule
in
peacock
is
this.
underneath
that
rule,
any
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
or
almost
any
defendant
can
remove
his
case
from
police
court
to
federal
court
by
simply
an
allegation
of
this
kind
because
that's
all
in
peacock
that
he
is
associated
with
some
civil
rights
group
or
engaged
in
some
civil
rights
work
that
he's
been
charged
or
arrested
for
something.
it
might
be
driving
without
a
license
or
traffic
ticket
or
over
parking,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
he's
been
charged
with
that
and
that
the
motive
of
making
the
charge
was
to
deter
him
in
some
equal
civil
right
and
that
case
is
then
removed
to
federal
court.
now
under
the
hearing
in
--
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
then
--
mr.
hardy
lott
that's
right.
then
under
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
rule
in
peacock,
the
man
would
then
go
into
court
and
you
would
have
a
hearing
in
federal
court
to
determine
the
motive
or
to
prosecute.
now
--
mr.
hardy
lott
well,
his
petition
doesn't
make
out
any
case
for
removal.
he
can't
point
to
any
state
constitutional
provision,
but
that
will
prevent
him
from
--
mr.
hardy
lott
i
would
say
they
could
be
removed
if
he
could
point
as
this
court
has
held
to
a
state
constitutional
provision
or
statute
which
he
followed
by
the
state
court
in
his
case,
would
result
in
the
denial
of
some
right
conferred
on
him
by
some
statute
that
the
united
states
provided
the
equal
civil
rights.
mr.
hardy
lott
no
sir.
i
would
say
this
that
the
removal
statute
says,
the
point
that
i'm
concerned
with
now
section
1,
relates
to
just
exactly
what
i
read.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir,
that
is,
but
the
congress
hasn't
given
you
removal
jurisdiction
in
such
a
case.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
they
have
left
that
to
the
revisory
power
of
the
state
court
and
then
if
they
don't
do
it
ultimately
to
this
court.
but
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
those
seven
cases,
congress
hasn't
given
you
a
removal
of
jurisdiction
in
those.
now
let
me
say
this.
in
the
beginning
in
1866,
they
did
when
the
statute
was
first
enacted.
in
1866,
you
could
remove
a
case
after
the
judgment.
you
could
not
only
remove
it
before,
but
after
the
trial
in
a
state
court,
if
you
had
been
denied
of
some
equal
civil
right,
then
you
could
remove
it
to
federal
court
and
have
a
trial
all
over
again.
but
the
congress
repealed
that
in
1874
and
they
left
the
statute
as
it
is
now
as
interpreted
by
this
court
that
your
only
time
for
removal
is
in
advance
of
the
trial
in
showing
these
things.
now
getting
back
to
my
point
and
i
think
this
was
important.
any
defendant
on
the
peacock
can
remove
that
case
to
a
federal
court
by
a
simple
allegation
he's
engaged
in
civil
rights
and
he's
been
arrested
and
that
the
prosecution
was
for
an
improper
motive.
now,
you
then
are
going
to
have
one
trial
and
possibly
two
trials
in
federal
court.
your
first
is
going
to
be
a
trial
to
examine
the
motive
of
whoever
brought
the
charge
whether
it's
a
grand
jury
or
police
officer
or
what
not.
under
the
peacock
rule,
the
court
would
have
to
decide
that
before
it
knew
whether
it
had
jurisdiction.
it
would
hear
the
evidence
as
to
the
motive
of
whoever
brought
the
charge.
now
that
could
involve
a
quite
of
lengthy
thing.
and
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
the
burden
is
not
only
on
the
federal
district
court
to
try
all
these
police
court
cases
from
over
parking
and
driving
without
a
license,
the
burden
on
a
municipality
to
enforce
a
law
is
just
beyond
its
ability
to
reach
in
most
towns.
i
don't
know
about
washington
and
philadelphia,
but
they
would
have
to
do
is
this.
you
have
to
go
to
a
federal
court
which
is
probably
some
distance
from
your
town.
you
have
to
hire
a
lawyer
of
course
to
represent
you
in
federal
court
and
you
have
to
take
witnesses.
now,
if
there's
a
motive
of
the
prosecutor
like
in
these
cases,
you
have
to
transport
your
witnesses,
your
policeman
there.
you'd
probably
have
to
have
the
mayor
and
police
commissioner
to
testify
about
the
policy
of
the
city
and
so
forth.
you
would
have
all
of
that
hearing
to
decide
the
motive
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
motive
of
the
grand
jury
or
whoever
brought
the
charge.
now
suppose
then
that
the
court
decided
that
the
motive
was
not
bad
to
deter
to
exercise
some
civil
rights
then
he
would
remand
the
case.
but
if
he
decided
that
the
motive
of
the
prosecutor
was
bad,
then
a
removal
jurisdiction
would
be
established
under
the
peacock
case
and
then
you
would
have
a
trial
on
the
merits
to
see
whether
he's
guilty
or
not.
because
after
all,
the
motive
of
the
policeman
in
charging
this
man
who's
blocking
the
street
or
was
driving
without
a
proper
license
on
his
automobile
may
have
been
as
bad
as
can
be
but
that
doesn't
mean
he's
not
guilty
of
it.
mr.
hardy
lott
your
honor
--
mr.
hardy
lott
my
disagreement
with
that
is
on
this
basis.
that
in
those
seven
cases
of
this
court
that
you
are
talking
about
that
he
referred
to
was
bringing
the
charge.
the
charge
was
brought
by
a
stacked
grand
jury.
in
each
of
those
seven
cases,
they
deliberately
deprived
the
defendant
of
his
equal
civil
rights
by
excluding
negroes
from
the
grand
jury
and
a
charge
was
brought
by
the
grand
jury
and
he
was
arrested.
mr.
hardy
lott
and
--
mr.
hardy
lott
that's
right.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
hardy
lott
now,
in
this
case
he's
saying
that
when
a
police
officer
brings
a
charge
and
not
a
grand
jury
but
a
police
officer
brings
a
charge
improperly
that
that
is
a
distinction
in
which
those
seven
cases
don't
apply
to
it
that
they
only
--
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir,
but
now--
mr.
hardy
lott
well
now,
in
the
seven
cases
that
was
decided
by
this
court
your
honor,
those
law
of
state
statutes,
one
against
murder,
one
against
rape
and
the
charge
in
that
case
in
all
of
those
seven
cases
was
improperly
brought
by
the
grand
jury
in
the
sense
that
the
court
officers
stacked
that
grand
jury.
so
under
any
state
statute,
murder
and
rape
and
so
forth,
i
don't
see
the
distinction
that
he
is
attempting
to
make.
i
can't
see
why
if
the
grand
jury
stacked
on
you
and
you
indicted
underneath
a
state
statute,
that's
not
removable
but
if
a
police
officer
comes
in
and
does
it
and
does
it
for
an
improper
motive
with
no
indictment
that
therefore
that
makes
it
removable
and
i
just
can't
follow
him
on
that.
now
in
substance,
what
we
contend
about
section
1
is
that,
as
i've
stated
that
the
statute
says
“and
i
can't
enforce
him
in
the
state
court,
this
court
has
so
interpreted.
all
the
courts
in
united
states
have
followed
that.
congress
has
not
changed
that
rule.
and
what
the
gentlemen
are
asking
you
to
do
is
to
do
what
congress
had
done.
they're
asking
you
now
at
this
late
date
to
amend
that
statute
by
striking
out
that
part
as
i
think
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
that
your
denial
has
to
be
in
the
state
court.
they've
only
disregarded
that
because
if
they
said
that
the
prosecution
was
to
deprive
you
of
a
right
that
was
sufficient
and
what
i
say,
what
we
submit
is
that
it
is
now
much
too
late
for
this
court
to
do
and
this
court
should
not
do
what
congress
has
refused
to
do
and
that
is
to
adopt
their
amendment
of
the
statute.
mr.
hardy
lott
no
sir.
mr.
hardy
lott
i
didn't
know
that
your
honor
until
i
read
the
case
which
is
not
yet
reported
of
the
--
i
forget
the
title
of
it
–
it
is
raines
versus
the
city
of
danville
from
the
fourth
circuit
--
baines,
i
said
raines,
it's
baines,
b-a-i-n-e-s.
until
after
i
filed
my
briefs
and
i
read
their
opinion
where
they
pointed
that
out
and
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
restrictive,
so-called
restrictive
interpretation
of
this
court,
one
interpretation
of
this
court
told
it
was
the
act
of
congress
in
repealing
removal
after
judgment.
mr.
hardy
lott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
peacock
and
13
others
filed
a
removal
petition
in
the
federal
district
court,
alleging
that
they
were
being
prosecuted
in
a
police
court
of
the
city
of
greenwood
for
blocking
public
streets.
the
district
court
remanded
the
cases
to
the
police
court
on
the
face
of
the
petition.
they
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
held
that
the
allegations
of
the
petition
were
sufficient,
if
proved,
to
make
other
case
for
removal
under
the
first
section
of
28
u.s.c.
1443
and
they
reversed
the
case
and
remanded
it
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
court
to
hear
evidence
to
see
if
peacock
and
those
could
prove
the
allegations
of
their
petition.
the
peacock
petition
alleges
very
little
about
the
substance
of
the
allegations
are
--
that
peacock
--
the
petitions
are
identical
so
only
one
is
in
the
record.
the
allegations
are
that
peacock
is
a
member
of
the
student
non-violent
coordinating
committee
which
is
associated
with
cofo
and
that
they
were
engaged
in
civil
rights
work
in
assisting
negroes
to
register
to
vote.
they
then
alleged
that
they
were
arrested
for
blocking
public
streets.
they
draw
the
conclusion
and
make
the
conclusionary
allegation
that
because,
well
first,
that
the
statute
is
being
applied
to
them
in
support
of
a
policy
of
segregation
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
city
of
greenwood.
they
then
make
the
conclusionary
allegation
that
because
of
their
prosecution,
because
of
the
above
that
they
are
denied
and
cannot
enforce
in
court
the
equal
rights
of
citizens
under
the
constitution
in
42
u.s.c.
1971.
now
the
other
cases
were
combined
here.
those
came
along
later,
there
were
15
defendants.
they
alleged
prosecution
in
the
police
court
of
greenwood
for
various
offenses
on
different
dates,
assault
and
battery,
driving
a
car
with
an
improper
license,
reckless
driving,
matters
of
that
kind.
the
district
court
did
the
same
thing
with
those
cases,
remanded
them
on
the
face
of
the
petition.
they
came
up
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
later
in
the
peacock
case
so
that
there
was
no
briefing
and
no
argument
in
that
case.
they
sustained
a
summary
motion
to
reverse
on
the
ground
that
it
was
controlled
by
peacock.
now
what
we
were
concerned
with
here
in
the
peacock
case
is
the
removal
statute,
1443.
now
it's
settled
law
that
this
court
only
has
such
jurisdiction
in
the
removal
case
as
congress
has
conferred
upon
it,
as
conferred
upon
the
federal
courts
and
the
question
here
is
what
jurisdiction
congress
can
put
by
the
first
section
of
1443.
now
that
section
gives
a
person
a
right
to
remove
in
a
civil
or
criminal
prosecution,
brought
against
any
person
who
is
denied
or
cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
such
state,
a
right
on
any
law
providing
for
the
equal
rights
of
citizens
of
united
states.
now
the
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
in
that
is
what
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
overlooked
is
the
language
in
that
statute
“who
is
denied
or
cannot
enforce
in
the
courts
of
such
statement.”
now
the
statute
provides
that
in
order
to
remove,
you
have
to
file
your
removal
petition
before
the
trial.
so
--
that
this
court
has
held
that
being
true
and
that's
the
statute,
you
have
to
allege
facts
in
advance
of
a
trial
to
show
that
in
the
state
court,
you
will
be
denied
or
cannot
enforce
some
equal
civil
right.
this
court
therefore
held
in
eight
cases
mentioned
in
the
previous
argument
beginning
with
strauder
versus
west
virginia
and
virginia
versus
rives
on
the
same
date
and
going
down
through
kentucky
versus
powers
that
since
that
is
true
that
you
have
to
file
your
petition
and
allege
and
show
in
advance
that
you're
going
to
be
denied
or
cannot
enforce
an
equal
civil
right
in
court.
that
therefore,
it
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
by
that
statute
to
take
care
of
any
deprivation
of
rights
that
might
come
up
on
the
trial
for
the
first
time
because
you
wouldn't
know
that
until
it
happened.
that
you
had
to
be
able
to
point
it
in
advance
that
you
would
be
denied
or
can
enforce
in
the
courts
of
a
state
an
equal
civil
right
and
that
the
only
way
you
could
do
that
is
where
there
was
a
statute
or
constitutional
provision
of
the
state
which
if
the
state
court
followed
would
obligate
it
to
deny
use
on
the
equal
civil
right.
now
in
the
absence
of
that,
this
court
has
held
in
those
eight
cases
or
in
the
last
seven
at
least,
that
you
can't
remove
underneath
that
statute.
they
specifically
held
that
if
a
subordinate
officer
undertakes
to
deprive
a
defendant
of
his
equal
civil
rights
in
advance
of
trial
by
a
person
who
is
stacking
the
grand
jury,
refusing
to
put
anybody
on
the
grand
jury
if
it's
colored
defendant
except
white
people,
that
doesn't
show
that
he
is
going
to
be
denied
or
can't
enforce
his
equal
civil
rights
in
the
state
court
because
the
presumption
is
that
the
court
will
correct
that.
that
if
it's
a
matter
of
stacking
the
grand
jury
that
the
court
when
the
trial
comes
on
will
sustain
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
if
it's
a
matter
of
petit
jury,
the
same
thing.
so
that
this
court
held
and
it
seems
to
me
they
were
obligated
to
do
it
under
the
statute,
but
in
any
event,
they
held
it
eight
times
that
you
couldn't
remove
underneath
the
statute
without
showing
in
advance
that
you're
going
to
be
denied
or
couldn't
enforce
your
rights
in
state
court
and
that
the
only
way
you
could
show
that
is
if
there
was
a
constitutional
provision
or
statute
of
the
state
which
if
followed
by
the
state
court
would
have
that
result.
now
that
--
those
decisions
have
been
criticized
by
those
who
want
more
removal
on
the
ground
that
is
a
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
statute.
well
it
doesn't
seem
that
way
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
went
pretty
far
when
it
held
that
they
weren't
go
and
presume
that
the
state
court
would
do
what
it
should
do
and
disregard
an
invalid
state
statute
and
follow
the
paramount
federal
law.
but
that
they
would
indulge
in
the
presumption
that
the
state
court
being
bound
by
state
law
if
there
was
a
state
statute
or
constitutional
provision
that
they
would
say
the
state
court
was
going
to
follow
it
and
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
that
presumption
and
permit
him
to
remove.
now
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
we
submit
with
difference,
completely
overlooked
that
portion
of
the
statute
in
the
peacock
case.
that
is
the
portion
that
the
denial
or
inability
enforced
has
got
to
be
in
court
and
they
completely,
in
our
opinion,
disregarded
the
eight
decisions
of
this
court
to
that
effect.
what
they
held
in
the
peacock
case
was
that
the
very
institution
of
the
prosecution
would
enable
you
to
remove
on
allegation
that
the
prosecution
was
instituted
for
an
improper
motive
to
deprive
use
of
civil
rights.
in
other
words,
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
was
this
that
in
this
case
where
the
arrest
and
charges
were
made
by
a
policemen
and
i
believe
the
alleged
policemen
and
officers
of
the
county,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
was
sufficient
if
an
allegation
that
they
were
made
by
them
for
an
improper
motive
to
arrest
them
and
exercise
of
their
civil
rights.
now
the
statute
doesn't
allege
--
i
mean
the
removal
petition
doesn't
contain
such
an
allegation
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
applied
this
notice
type
pleading
doctrine
and
said
they
would
infer
that
that's
what
the
peacock
and
all
of
those
would
contend.
so
they
held
that
the
mere
institution
of
the
prosecution
by
a
policemen
was
sufficient
to
remove.
now
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
and
logic,
we
submit
that
the
institution
of
a
prosecution
or
the
making
of
a
charge
or
an
improper
charge,
if
you
please,
by
a
policemen,
does
not
show
that
you're
deprived
or
cannot
enforce
your
rights
in
state
court.
as
held
by
this
court,
the
presumption
is
if
there's
something
improper
in
there,
if
he's
brought
a
charge
that
he
should
not
have
brought,
the
presumption
is
that
the
state
court
will
sustain
you
and
as
such
there's
no
way
to
say
that
the
charge
by
a
policemen
means,
it's
a
proof
that
you're
denied
or
can't
enforce
your
rights
in
a
state
court.
now
if
you
replace
the
thing.
suppose
that
some
federal
marshal
may
enforce
arrest
or
arrest
a
man
with
safe
and
improper
motive,
that
certainly
no
proof
that
you
are
denied
or
can
enforce
your
equal
civil
rights
in
the
federal
court
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
a
policeman,
but
in
any
event,
whether
it's
true
or
not,
this
court
has
so
held.
now
this
court
so
held
in
seven
cases
that
where
a
subordinate
state
officer
packed
the
grand
jury
by
illegally
excluding
colored
persons
from
the
grand
jury
and
also
the
petit
jury
that
the
case
was
not
removed.
now
in
that
case,
a
charge
was
brought
by
a
grand
jury
that
it
was
improperly
selected
in
violation
of
federal
law
and
packed
and
they
brought
the
charge.
this
court
held
in
those
seven
cases
that
that
case
was
not
removal
because
that
did
not
show
that
you
were
denied
or
couldn't
enforce
your
rights
in
state
court
that
the
presumption
was
a
state
court
would
enforce
your
rights
and
would
quash
the
indictment
as
a
whole.
now
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
peacock
is
no
doubt
about
their
holding.
if
you'll
read
their
opinion
carefully,
it's
hard
to
believe
that
they
even
realized
that
this
denial
and
enforcement
had
to
be
in
the
state
court.
in
any
event,
they
came
out
with
just
a
flat
holding
that
a
prosecution
for
an
improper
motive
instituted
to
deprive
you
of
your
civil
rights
made
out
a
case
of
removal.
mr.
hardy
lott
your
honor,
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
but
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
hardy
lott
this
court
in
seven
cases,
in
seven
straight
cases
have
held
that
statute
the
denial
and
inability
to
enforce
relief
to
the
state
court.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
mr.
hardy
lott
now
in
which
one
--
yes
sir.
now
in
each
one
of
those
seven
cases
that
i'm
talking
about,
the
man
had
been
deprived
of
his
equal
civil
rights
by
stacking
the
grand
jury
on
and
it
didn't
relate
to
a
court,
those
cases,
all
seven
of
them
would
have
been
removed,
but
this
court
held
that
that
language
and
you
can
read
it
that
way,
applies
to
the
court.
now
let
me
say
this.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
sustain
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
peacock
case
for
these
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
if
you
do,
you
would
have
to
overrule
seven
decisions.
you
have
to
overrule
that
part
of
the
decision
holding
that
under
subsection
(1)
the
denial
or
inability
to
enforce
had
to
be
shown
by
a
state
statute
or
constitutional
provision.
you
would
have
to
overrule
that.
you
would
have
to
overrule
your
own
opinions
in
those
seven
cases
that
the
acts
of
state
officers
in
depriving
you
of
your
rights
in
advance
of
trial
were
not
sufficient
for
removal
because
the
presumption
is
the
state
court
will
correct
it.
now
those
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
in
effect
and
have
been
a
settled
law
since
at
least
1879.
during
that
period
of
time,
congress
has
not
made
any
significant
changes
in
the
wording
of
that
statute
that
would
affect
those
decisions
and
congress
having
conferred
the
removal
of
jurisdiction
and
having
acquiesced
in
that
interpretation
since
at
least
1879.
i
submit
that
it
will
be
too
late
now
to
come
in
for
this
statute
--
i
mean
for
this
court
to
do
what
congress
has
failed
to
do
and
that
is
to
amend
the
statute
and
that's
what
he's
arguing
you
should
do.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
i
want
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
this
that
in
considering
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
congress
had
previously
reenacted
this
statute
a
number
of
times
without
changing
the
word.
in
1964,
they
have
their
specific
attention
directed
to
it
in
1964.
they
amended
the
companion
statute
that
enabled
you
to
appeal
from
a
remand
order
under
1443.
prior
to
that,
you
couldn't
appeal
so
congress
had
its
particular
attention
directed
to
it
and
made
the
amendment
permitting
an
appeal
from
a
remand
order
in
a
civil
rights
case
under
1443.
now
in
that
same
session
of
congress,
i
found
out
that
two
of
the
lawyers
whose
names
assigned
to
the
brief
of
peacock,
appeared
before
congress
and
advocated
the
amendment
of
that
statute.
and
mr.
[inaudible]
introduced
it
and
his
citation
is
in
the
reply
brief
of
peacock.
a
statute
before
congress
to
amend
that
statute
and
make
it
do
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
peacock
it
did
do.
and
that
is
to
make
any
denial
of
right
whether
by
a
court
or
administrative
officer
or
whatnot
removed.
now
congress
didn't
do
that.
congress
failed
to
pass
that
statute
in
1964.
so
--
mr.
hardy
lott
i
don't
know
sir.
all
i
know
it
was
introduced
and
i
read
it
in
the
record
and
it
didn't
pass,
it
didn't
come
out.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
mr.
hardy
lott
i
don't
know
sir.
i
do
know
that
there
was
a
testimony
before
the
house
committee
because
i
read
the
hearings
about
this
particular
bill
and
two
of
the
gentlemen
here
appeared
and
even
mentioned
--
mr.
hardy
lott
i
don't
know
that
either
sir,
but
the
fact
that
i'm
getting
at
is
that
congress
since
1879
has
not
amended
that
statute,
has
reenacted
it
and
therefore
it
appears
to
us,
it
certainly
endorsed
the
opinions
of
this
court
which
have
been
settled
law
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
this
as
a
practical
matter.
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
the
peacock
case
lays
down
a
bad
rule
and
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
those
seven
cases
are
good
rules.
they're
not
only
good
because
they
follow
the
statute
and
after
all,
that's
the
question
here.
is
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
hardy
lott
i
think
under
the
liberal
interpretation
given
this
statute
by
this
court
in
those
seven
cases,
you
would
say
that
the
state
court
would
follow,
you
just
presume
the
state
court
would
follow
that
state
statute
and
therefore
you'd
say
that
you
could
remove.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
that's
what
these
seven
cases
hold.
they
say
that
that's
the
only
time
and
i
think
that's
the
liberal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
hardy
lott
no
sir,
but
they
said
this
that
in
any
case
in
which
you
could
point
to
a
state
constitutional
provision
or
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
or
as
reasonably
read
which
would
cause
--
if
the
state
court
followed
it,
would
cause
you
to
be
denied
or
unable
to
enforce
your
equal
civil
right
that
then
the
case
was
removable.
mr.
hardy
lott
no
sir,
certainly
not.
mr.
hardy
lott
and
follow
the
state
statute.
that's
the
interpretation
put
on
by
this
court
in
those
seven
cases.
now
in
peacock
of
course
we
don't
have
any
such
statute.
there's
no
legislative
denial.
the
statute
against
blocking
public
streets,
applies
to
everyone
alike.
there's
no
--
nothing
in
peacock
to
show
that
he
can't
get
his
rights
so
that
he
will
be
denied
them
in
state
court.
now
as
i
was
saying,
one
reason
that
that's
the
bad
rule
in
peacock
is
this.
underneath
that
rule,
any
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
or
almost
any
defendant
can
remove
his
case
from
police
court
to
federal
court
by
simply
an
allegation
of
this
kind
because
that's
all
in
peacock
that
he
is
associated
with
some
civil
rights
group
or
engaged
in
some
civil
rights
work
that
he's
been
charged
or
arrested
for
something.
it
might
be
driving
without
a
license
or
traffic
ticket
or
over
parking,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
he's
been
charged
with
that
and
that
the
motive
of
making
the
charge
was
to
deter
him
in
some
equal
civil
right
and
that
case
is
then
removed
to
federal
court.
now
under
the
hearing
in
--
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
then
--
mr.
hardy
lott
that's
right.
then
under
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
rule
in
peacock,
the
man
would
then
go
into
court
and
you
would
have
a
hearing
in
federal
court
to
determine
the
motive
or
to
prosecute.
now
--
mr.
hardy
lott
well,
his
petition
doesn't
make
out
any
case
for
removal.
he
can't
point
to
any
state
constitutional
provision,
but
that
will
prevent
him
from
--
mr.
hardy
lott
i
would
say
they
could
be
removed
if
he
could
point
as
this
court
has
held
to
a
state
constitutional
provision
or
statute
which
he
followed
by
the
state
court
in
his
case,
would
result
in
the
denial
of
some
right
conferred
on
him
by
some
statute
that
the
united
states
provided
the
equal
civil
rights.
mr.
hardy
lott
no
sir.
i
would
say
this
that
the
removal
statute
says,
the
point
that
i'm
concerned
with
now
section
1,
relates
to
just
exactly
what
i
read.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir,
that
is,
but
the
congress
hasn't
given
you
removal
jurisdiction
in
such
a
case.
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir.
they
have
left
that
to
the
revisory
power
of
the
state
court
and
then
if
they
don't
do
it
ultimately
to
this
court.
but
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
those
seven
cases,
congress
hasn't
given
you
a
removal
of
jurisdiction
in
those.
now
let
me
say
this.
in
the
beginning
in
1866,
they
did
when
the
statute
was
first
enacted.
in
1866,
you
could
remove
a
case
after
the
judgment.
you
could
not
only
remove
it
before,
but
after
the
trial
in
a
state
court,
if
you
had
been
denied
of
some
equal
civil
right,
then
you
could
remove
it
to
federal
court
and
have
a
trial
all
over
again.
but
the
congress
repealed
that
in
1874
and
they
left
the
statute
as
it
is
now
as
interpreted
by
this
court
that
your
only
time
for
removal
is
in
advance
of
the
trial
in
showing
these
things.
now
getting
back
to
my
point
and
i
think
this
was
important.
any
defendant
on
the
peacock
can
remove
that
case
to
a
federal
court
by
a
simple
allegation
he's
engaged
in
civil
rights
and
he's
been
arrested
and
that
the
prosecution
was
for
an
improper
motive.
now,
you
then
are
going
to
have
one
trial
and
possibly
two
trials
in
federal
court.
your
first
is
going
to
be
a
trial
to
examine
the
motive
of
whoever
brought
the
charge
whether
it's
a
grand
jury
or
police
officer
or
what
not.
under
the
peacock
rule,
the
court
would
have
to
decide
that
before
it
knew
whether
it
had
jurisdiction.
it
would
hear
the
evidence
as
to
the
motive
of
whoever
brought
the
charge.
now
that
could
involve
a
quite
of
lengthy
thing.
and
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
the
burden
is
not
only
on
the
federal
district
court
to
try
all
these
police
court
cases
from
over
parking
and
driving
without
a
license,
the
burden
on
a
municipality
to
enforce
a
law
is
just
beyond
its
ability
to
reach
in
most
towns.
i
don't
know
about
washington
and
philadelphia,
but
they
would
have
to
do
is
this.
you
have
to
go
to
a
federal
court
which
is
probably
some
distance
from
your
town.
you
have
to
hire
a
lawyer
of
course
to
represent
you
in
federal
court
and
you
have
to
take
witnesses.
now,
if
there's
a
motive
of
the
prosecutor
like
in
these
cases,
you
have
to
transport
your
witnesses,
your
policeman
there.
you'd
probably
have
to
have
the
mayor
and
police
commissioner
to
testify
about
the
policy
of
the
city
and
so
forth.
you
would
have
all
of
that
hearing
to
decide
the
motive
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
motive
of
the
grand
jury
or
whoever
brought
the
charge.
now
suppose
then
that
the
court
decided
that
the
motive
was
not
bad
to
deter
to
exercise
some
civil
rights
then
he
would
remand
the
case.
but
if
he
decided
that
the
motive
of
the
prosecutor
was
bad,
then
a
removal
jurisdiction
would
be
established
under
the
peacock
case
and
then
you
would
have
a
trial
on
the
merits
to
see
whether
he's
guilty
or
not.
because
after
all,
the
motive
of
the
policeman
in
charging
this
man
who's
blocking
the
street
or
was
driving
without
a
proper
license
on
his
automobile
may
have
been
as
bad
as
can
be
but
that
doesn't
mean
he's
not
guilty
of
it.
mr.
hardy
lott
your
honor
--
mr.
hardy
lott
my
disagreement
with
that
is
on
this
basis.
that
in
those
seven
cases
of
this
court
that
you
are
talking
about
that
he
referred
to
was
bringing
the
charge.
the
charge
was
brought
by
a
stacked
grand
jury.
in
each
of
those
seven
cases,
they
deliberately
deprived
the
defendant
of
his
equal
civil
rights
by
excluding
negroes
from
the
grand
jury
and
a
charge
was
brought
by
the
grand
jury
and
he
was
arrested.
mr.
hardy
lott
and
--
mr.
hardy
lott
that's
right.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
hardy
lott
now,
in
this
case
he's
saying
that
when
a
police
officer
brings
a
charge
and
not
a
grand
jury
but
a
police
officer
brings
a
charge
improperly
that
that
is
a
distinction
in
which
those
seven
cases
don't
apply
to
it
that
they
only
--
mr.
hardy
lott
yes
sir,
but
now--
mr.
hardy
lott
well
now,
in
the
seven
cases
that
was
decided
by
this
court
your
honor,
those
law
of
state
statutes,
one
against
murder,
one
against
rape
and
the
charge
in
that
case
in
all
of
those
seven
cases
was
improperly
brought
by
the
grand
jury
in
the
sense
that
the
court
officers
stacked
that
grand
jury.
so
under
any
state
statute,
murder
and
rape
and
so
forth,
i
don't
see
the
distinction
that
he
is
attempting
to
make.
i
can't
see
why
if
the
grand
jury
stacked
on
you
and
you
indicted
underneath
a
state
statute,
that's
not
removable
but
if
a
police
officer
comes
in
and
does
it
and
does
it
for
an
improper
motive
with
no
indictment
that
therefore
that
makes
it
removable
and
i
just
can't
follow
him
on
that.
now
in
substance,
what
we
contend
about
section
1
is
that,
as
i've
stated
that
the
statute
says
“and
i
can't
enforce
him
in
the
state
court,
this
court
has
so
interpreted.
all
the
courts
in
united
states
have
followed
that.
congress
has
not
changed
that
rule.
and
what
the
gentlemen
are
asking
you
to
do
is
to
do
what
congress
had
done.
they're
asking
you
now
at
this
late
date
to
amend
that
statute
by
striking
out
that
part
as
i
think
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
that
your
denial
has
to
be
in
the
state
court.
they've
only
disregarded
that
because
if
they
said
that
the
prosecution
was
to
deprive
you
of
a
right
that
was
sufficient
and
what
i
say,
what
we
submit
is
that
it
is
now
much
too
late
for
this
court
to
do
and
this
court
should
not
do
what
congress
has
refused
to
do
and
that
is
to
adopt
their
amendment
of
the
statute.
mr.
hardy
lott
no
sir.
mr.
hardy
lott
i
didn't
know
that
your
honor
until
i
read
the
case
which
is
not
yet
reported
of
the
--
i
forget
the
title
of
it
–
it
is
raines
versus
the
city
of
danville
from
the
fourth
circuit
--
baines,
i
said
raines,
it's
baines,
b-a-i-n-e-s.
until
after
i
filed
my
briefs
and
i
read
their
opinion
where
they
pointed
that
out
and
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
restrictive,
so-called
restrictive
interpretation
of
this
court,
one
interpretation
of
this
court
told
it
was
the
act
of
congress
in
repealing
removal
after
judgment.
