justice
william
o.
douglas
may
i
put
a
case
to
you
if
it
may?
we've
had
cases
in
the
past
involving
state
regulations
of
people
engaged
in
religious
activities.
i'm
thinking
of
some
of
our
jehovah's
witnesses
cases
where
the
municipalities
required
a
license.
and
we
held
that
proselytizing
in
a
manner
in
which
they
proselytize
was
an
exercise
in
religion
and
could
not
be
licensed
or
taxed
by
the
state
government.
now
on
a
case
like
that,
if
they
were
arrested,
i
suppose
since
they
are
--
were
asserting
a
constitutional
right
that
they
couldn't
be
removed
to
a
federal
court
even
though
they
might
get
a
fair
trial
in
the
state
court.
isn't
that
true?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
maybe
a
gloss
with
some
of
our
earlier
decisions
has
put
on
the
removal
statute,
but
doesn't
the
removal
statute
speak
in
terms
of
the
protection
of
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
like
free
exercise
a
religion
in
my
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
mere
fact
of
the
arrest
and
the
prosecution
is
unconstitutional
taking
at
the
face
value
of
the
allegation,
is
it
an
unconstitutional
deprivation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
a
question
in
this
case,
i
guess.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
that's
putting
a
gloss
on
the
statute
because
the
statute
reads
in
terms
as
you
know
against
any
person
who
is
denied
the
right
of
equal
protection.
