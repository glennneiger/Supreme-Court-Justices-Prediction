mr.

chief

mr.
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith,
why
do
we
have
to
allege
in
your
petition
to
remove
this
back
to
the
--
or
to
get
the
federal
court
to
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
get
that
last
--
what
you
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
statute
is
unconstitutional
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
assume
that
the
state
comes
in
and
denies
that
in
these
general
terms
as
you
have
alleged
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
is
the
procedure?
what
is
required?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
ask
that
was
because
i
understood
counsel
in
the
case
just
before
yours
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
say
that
he
didn't
think
that
was
necessary
that
this
applied
not
because
of
discrimination
but
because
it
applied
now
to
all
states
because
congress
had
made
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
that.
do
you
feel
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne,
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
the
procedure
would
be
in
this
situation
now.
as
i
understand
it
in
these
cases,
two
of
these
people
at
least
were
charged
with
operating
motor
vehicles
in
an
improper
manner.
they
have
sought
the
removal
to
the
federal
court.
what
would
they
have
to
allege
and
what
would
they
have
to
prove
to
bring
that
under
the
civil
rights
act
so
that
the
case
would
be
tried
in
the
federal
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
as
i
understand
it
is
for
operating
vehicles
with
improper
license
tags.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
what
would
you
have
to
prove
as
a
practical
matter
there
that
there
were
other
licensed
people
with
improper
license
tags
running
around
the
community
or
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
sufficient
to
raise
civil
rights
question
for
the
court
to
pass
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
give
them
any
right
to
have
unregistered
license?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
you
try
the
question
of
guilt
on
the
--
in
determining
whether
they're
entitled
to
the
remand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
removal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
there
have
to
be
a
preliminary
hearing
before
the
judge
to
determine
whether
this
charge
was
within
the
civil
rights
of
these
people
or
would
you
go
ahead
and
let
them
try
it
and
determine
it
on
--
before
the
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
they
say
before
the
question
of
remand
was
determined
that
there
was
a
prosecutor
down
there
who
is
prejudiced
against
negroes
and
he
prosecutes
us
more
vigorously
than
others
and
there's
a
judge
down
there
who
is
unfair
in
his
decisions
so
far
as
negroes
are
concerned
or
the
sheriff
is
unfair
and
so
forth.
would
that
kind
of
proof
be
available
to
them
to
show
that
a
motor
vehicle
--
a
charge
of
the
motor
vehicle
violation
would
come
under
this
act
as
a
violation
of
their
civil
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
if
he
wasn't
attacking
the
statute
and
that
that
was
only
relevant
but
not
conclusive,
what
would
you
add
to
it
to
make
it
conclusive?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whatever
you
have
to
--
whatever
you
have
to
allege
and
prove
in
order
to
keep
it
in
the
federal
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
was
a
crime
where
they
do
normally
prosecute
people
for
that
kind
of
a
crime.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
thinking
of
the
ramifications
of
these
things.
suppose
a
man
was
caught
driving
the
car
down
the
street
and
was
going
to
civil
rights
meeting
and
he
ran
over
for
that
civilian
and
killed
him
and
was
prosecuted
for
manslaughter.
could
he
go
to
the
federal
courts
and
allege
that
he's
going
to
a
civil
rights
meeting
and
was
in
the
exercise
of
those
rights
as
a
result
of
which
he
was
being
prosecuted
for
this
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
pretty
hard
to
draw
a
line
of
this
between
one
and
another.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
alexander
that
this
applies
all
over
the
country
to
every
state
in
the
union
or
do
you
think
that
it's
restrictive
to
a
certain
number
of
states
where
congress
has
felt
that
these
rights
have
been
abused.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
manner
of
proof
would
be
the
same
for
the
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll
recess
this
time
for
