for

we

[inaudible]
justice

[inaudible]
justice

[inaudible]

but
if
it
was
a
petty

question
or
a
punishment
question,
you
are
to
go
ahead
and
you
help
the
court
try
the
case.
and
then
you
will
just
say
--
you
just
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
mean
to
send

back.
he
is
only
to
send
it
back
if
it
was
determined
that
--
if
it
was
determined
that
there
was
a
proper
application
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
also
say
there
should
be
a
remand
if
you
--
the
fact
you
put
on
a
case
about
discrimination
in
the
petit
jury
and
the
judge
ruled
against
you
and
he
was
affirmed
on
appeal.
he
would
still
--
he
would
say
that
--
wouldn't
you
remand
the
case
out
of
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
actually
block
the
streets
or
block
the
sidewalk.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
for
a
different
reason,
but
you
think
any
criminal
case
in
the
federal
court
would
come
down
in
putting
any
difference
on
what
the
charge
was,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
haven't
some
to
those
cases
--
didn't
some
of
those
cases
involve
these
provisionary
findings
about
the
grand
jury
where
anything
that
happened
to
the
grand
jury
had
already
occurred
in
denying
the
petition
for
removal?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
--
the
state
court
relies
on
the
absence
of
the
statute
to
rule
properly
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
all
the
time
that
amounted
to
the
alleged
deprivation
had
already
taken
place
and
was
adjudicated
--
it
was
adjudicable
right
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
true
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
could
be
true
in
the
cases
you
have
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
all
of
these
people
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
what
about
the
case
where
it's
intended
to
the
removal
is
justified
because
otherwise
a
valid
state
law,
a
trespass
or
something
else
has
been
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
that's
the
allegation
in
the
removal
petition.
now
you
wouldn't
--
are
you
suggesting
that
you're
not
only
to
try
it
out
in
the
federal
court
not
by
the
judge
but
by
the
jury?
you
do
not
only
try
out
the
allegations
of
discriminatory
enforcement
or
do
you
try
out
the
entire
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
from
what
you
said
in
your
brief
that
you
would
try
out
merely
the
additional
question
someway
either
by
the
judge
or
the
jury
and
if
the
allegations
were
proved,
you
would
dismiss
the
case
entirely.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
have
to
prove
them
you
have
to
remand
it
to
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
--
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
judge
or
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
also
that
you
--
that
where
the
issue
is
whether
a
conduct
is
protected
by
a
federal
statute
as
in
rachel
that
the
allegation
is
that
--
that
this
could
never
be
a
section
1
case.
a
section
with
removal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
difference
on
how
it's
tried
out
in
the
federal
court
under
your
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
this
consent
us?
what
if
there's
a
factual
dispute
between
the
two.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
so
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
you
view
it
under
one
or
two.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
suggest
that
all
of
these
cases
in
the
peacock
case,
in
this
proceeding
are
sustainable
under
section
1
like
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
was
or
do
you
think
you
must
resort
to
section
2
for
any
of
these
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
we
could
treat
this
case
in
the
abstract
and
set
down
some
ground
rules
and
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
think
that
they
didn't
say
that
--
they
didn't
say
that
if
discriminatory
prosecutions
were
shown,
they
were
all
sustainable
they're
all
removal
under
section
1.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
the
way,
on
removal
in
diversity
cases,
you
certainly
don't
just
hear
the
case
on
federal
court
on
allegations
insofar
as
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
concerned.
you
have
a
trial
on
a
remand
motion
that
isn't
a
trial
and
somewhere
in
--
and
in
this
particular
removal
statute,
you
have
allegations
that
would
have
to
do
on
jurisdiction
that
go
to
the
merits.
the
jurisdiction
in
the
merits
overlapped
and
i
would
think
there's
quite
a
distinction
between
the
removal
of
sections
in
this
regard.
