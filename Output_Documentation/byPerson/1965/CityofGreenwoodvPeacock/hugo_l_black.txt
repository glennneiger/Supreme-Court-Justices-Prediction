mr.
lott,
may
i
ask
you?
did
you
cite
the
1874
statute
which
you
refer
as
having
been
repealed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
repealed
at
1874?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
what
you
mean
by
that?
these
were
white
people
who
are
doing
this,
they
couldn't
get
it
removed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
white
people,
all
in
the
labor
unions.
labor
union
is
composed
of
white
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
don't
think
that
a
labor
union
is
arrested
under
the
same
circumstances,
made
the
same
allegations,
would
he
have
a
right
to
remove
it
or
not,
labor
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
seems
to
me
to
be
in
that
forceful
argument
that
this
was
--
this
is
always
said
for
the
protection
of
the
colored
people
and
because
of
the
situation
which
existed
and
then
it
applies
to
them
so
that
they
should
have
a
right
to
have
a
case
removed
whenever
they
can
--
whenever
they
allege,
they
can't
get
a
fair
trial
in
that
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
any
reason
whatever.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
claiborne,
i
just
read
the
facts
alleged
in
this
petition
for
removal.
coming
to
it
in
your
judgment,
does
it
show
and
allege
enough
facts
to
justify
a
removal
and
to
prevent
a
remand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
fact
you
need
to
be
headed
to
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
speaking
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
i
misunderstood
you.
your
position
is
that
if
it
alleges
these
facts,
that's
all,
alleges
these
facts,
the
judge
has
to
assume
they're
true.
he
does
not
try
it
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
anyone
by
alleging
the
facts,
the
facts
enough
to
bring
them
under
the
statute
whether
they
are
true
or
not,
gets
a
removal
and
is
tried
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
talking
about
is
right
at
the
trial
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
depends
all
together
on
allegation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
the
courts
be
protected
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
it
and
that's
the
interpretation
from
having
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cases
imposed
on
them
filed
every
year
when
there's
really
no
justification
for
it
in
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
no
excuse
if
congress
has
said,
i
agree
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
will
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
pretty
active.
i
represented
the
purpose
that
if
anything
accused
delay
--
considerable
delay
particularly
is
just
the
[inaudible]
or
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
all
they
have
to
do
is
allege
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
going
on
the
assumption
the
defendants
wouldn't
take
advantage
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
an
action
i
think.
it
has
been
in
many
places
that
the
best
defense
a
defendant
has
is
delay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
defendant.[laughter]
justice
hugo

black
mr.
