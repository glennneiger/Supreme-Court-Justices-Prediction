mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
turn
immediately
to
the
statute
and
to
the
several
sections
of
it
as
we
analyze
it.
as
we
see
it,
the
statute
states
four
separate
distinct
grounds
for
removal.
they
are
incorporated
in
the
four
operative
clauses
of
the
statute
which
we
label,
first,
the
denial
clause,
secondly,
the
inability
to
enforce
clause;
thirdly,
both
of
those
in
the
first
paragraph,
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
color
of
authority
clause
and
finally
the
refusal
clause.
as
we
view
this
case,
it
turns
on
only
two
of
those
clauses,
the
first
one,
the
denial
clause
and
the
third
one,
the
color
of
authority
clause.
now
counsel
for
peacock
also
invoked
the
other
two
clauses
in
this
case,
inability
to
enforce
clause
and
the
refusal
clause.
i
should
say
something
about
our
view
of
the
scope
of
those
provisions
as
well.
but
first,
let
me
distinguish
between
the
clauses
in
the
first
paragraph
as
a
group
and
the
clauses
in
the
second
paragraph.
the
first
paragraph
very
clearly
deals
with
all
kinds
of
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
denied
or
unable
to
enforce
in
the
courts
of
the
states
procedural
--
primarily
procedural
rights.
it
makes
no
difference
out
of
what
context
the
case
arises.
in
the
language
of
the
1866
act,
it
was
for
any
cause
whatsoever.
the
problem
dealt
with
in
that
clause
is,
as
mr.
smith
says,
the
unfairness
which
is
anticipated
at
the
trial
because
of
procedural
or
other
rules
which
may
put
the
defendant
to
the
disadvantage
at
trial
that
is
at
least
the
primary
thrust
of
the
first
paragraph
as
we
see
it.
the
second
paragraph
on
the
contrary
is
not
concerned
with
what
happens
at
court
or
what
will
happen,
but
is
concerned
solely
with
the
context
out
of
which
the
case
arises
that
is
the
activity
for
which
legal
proceeding
by
the
state
or
by
private
individual
for
that
matter
since
this
applies
as
well
to
civil
actions,
seeks
to
interfere
or
deter
and
those
are
the
rights
provided
by
the
substantive
laws
providing
for
equal
rights.
some
of
them
already
outlined
in
the
1966
act,
others
outlined
in
the
acts
of
1870
and
1871
and
of
course
subsequently
by
laws
like
the
public
accommodations
act
of
1964.
now
as
i
say,
we
argue
only
under
the
denial
clause
and
under
the
color
of
authority
clause.
within
the
first
paragraph,
we
do
distinguish
between
the
denial
clause
and
the
inability
to
enforce
clause.
the
inability
to
enforce
clause,
it
seems
to
us,
deals
with
an
apprehension
as
to
the
future
deprivation
of
rights
at
the
trial.
that
presents
the
question
of
prediction.
it
presents
a
very
delicate
problem
of
as
mr.
justice
fortas
put
it
i
believe
in
trying
the
state
court
in
advance.
it's
something
which
one
is
reluctant
to
do
and
it
is
in
our
view
in
large
part
an
explanation
of
the
line
of
decisions
cited
here
beginning
with
virginia
versus
rives
in
which
this
court
indicated
that
it
was
unwilling
to
make
that
prediction
in
advance
that
the
state
judge
would
be
unfaithful
to
his
constitutional
oath
unless
there
was
a
strong
indication
in
that
direction
which
this
court
found,
could
only
be
supplied
by
a
legislative
directive
to
him
to
deny
equal
protection
in
the
sense
of
equal
procedural
right.
now
the
denial
clause
has
a
different
scope
only
because
it
deals
with
a
different
time.
it
is
denied
as
we
read
it
means,
since
we're
talking
about
removal
before
trial,
the
other
type
of
removal
is
now
authorized,
is
at
that
moment
or
has
already
been
denied
rights.
we're
no
longer
dealing
with
the
prediction
of
future
events
with
the
fact
that
the
trail
judge
may
not
allow
the
defendant
to
testify
as
he
would
other
with
other
defendants
that
he
may
deny
some
other
courtroom
privilege
to
the
defendant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true
mr.
justice
white.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
attitude
or
the
approach
this
court
took
even
though
a
motion
to
quash
in
some
of
those
cases
are
actually
been
denied
with
reference
to
the
discriminatory
selection
of
the
grand
jury
was
that
this
was
still
a
correctable
error
and
that
the
prediction
that
we
justify
removal
was
a
prediction
that
the
court
at
some
later
stage
of
the
proceeding
or
that
the
appellate
state
court
would
decline
to
correct
the
error.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
white,
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
all
of
the
conduct
because
this
court
viewed
the
conduct
which
were
justified
removal
as
a
final
refusal
to
quash
as
it
were.
and
this
court
said
the
fact
that
the
motion
to
quash
has
already
been
denied
is
not
final.
it
is
still
correctable
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
appellate
court.
and
it
is
only
if
those
events
take
place,
if
the
court
persist
in
its
refusal
to
vacate
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true.
we
speak
of
the
denial
clause
as
applicable
to
that
sort
of
case,
the
sort
of
case
this
court
has
recognized
particularly
in
the
first
amendment
area.
and
most
recently
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister
where
the
institution
of
the
prosecution
of
a
formal
court
proceeding
is
itself
so
great
a
denial
that
even
if
acquittal
results,
even
if
conviction
is
accomplished
and
ultimately,
the
conviction
is
reversed
in
some
higher
court,
even
this
court,
that
will
be
too
little
or
too
late.
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
court
proceeding
has
already
denied
rights
in
a
very
immediate
real
sense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
those
cases
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
those
cases
have
been
--i
think
largely,
if
not,
entirely
confined
to
the
first
amendment
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
but
we
do
think
that
this
area
is
in
every
respect,
perhaps
not
every
respect,
in
many
respects
quite
comparable
to
the
first
amendment
area.
these
prosecutions
do
deter
the
exercise
of
rights
and
i
think
it
has
been
recognized
in
the
voting
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
here,
we're
talking
about
as
far
as
the
petition
is
alleged,
registration
for
voting
primarily.
certainly,
a
prosecution
of
a
prospective
registrant
tends
to
deter
at
least
in
a
community
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
know
that
they
were
all
prospective
registrants,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
some
of
them
were
sympathizers,
helpers.
they
were
aiding
and
abetting
the
registration
by
negroes
in
leflore
county
or
at
least
by
merely
judging
from
the
face
of
the
petitions,
petitions
for
removal.
but
the
allegation
is
that
this
was
primarily
a
voting
drive
that
the
activity
was
halted
by
this
prosecution
that
was
indeed
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
prosecution
and
it
is
not
unreal
to
suppose
that
in
the
community
involved,
they
will
be
a
repressive,
deterrent
effect
from
such
prosecutions.
let
me
turn
however
to
the
color
of
authority
clause
in
the
second
section.
there
in
one
sense
we
deal
with
a
much
more
restrictive
category
of
cases.
here
we
do
not
include
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
engaged
in
any
activity
other
than
or
is
prosecuted
because
it's
engaging
in
any
activity
other
than
those
specified
in
laws,
in
terms
providing
for
equal
rights
and
that
is
to
say
federal
laws.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certainly
not
in
the
latter
two
instances
but
it's
conceivable
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
have
difficulty
with
the
-
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
in
the
case
of
murder,
it
could
conceivably
be
a
case
of
self-defense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
charge
would
be
murder,
the
petition
was
denied
that
it
was
murder
but
would
admit
it
was
homicide.
one
can
imagine
circumstances
where
a
murder
case
would
arise
out
of
the
exercise
of
protected
rights.
one
can
hardly
imagine
a
rape
or
burglary
case
arising
out
of
the
same
activity.
now
as
i
say
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
on
either
of
the
clauses
that
i've
mentioned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
of
course,
under
the
inability
to
enforce
clause
if
they
were
the
kind
of
demonstration
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
that
satisfied
the
cases
in
this
court
to
rives.
and
we
don't
say
that
those
cases
should
not
be
relaxed
for
the
purpose
of
the
inability
to
enforce
clause.
we
do
not
think
that
is
the
necessary
point
of
the
decision
here.
but
you're
quite
right
mr.
justice
stewart
that
as
to
the
two
clauses
i've
mentioned,
those
cases
you
hypothesize
would
not
be
removed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
it
seems
to
us
that
what
we
contend
for
under
the
color
of
authority
clause
presents
the
classical
case
for
removal.
it
follows
all
of
the
prior
removal
statutes
in
committing
removal
on
the
theory
that
a
federal
defense
is
involved
and
that
the
issue
at
trial
will
turn
on
the
existence
of
a
federal
defense
based
on
a
federal
right.
indeed
the
constitutional
basis
for
section
2,
as
opposed
to
section
1
of
1443,
seems
to
us
as
directly
in
article
3
and
does
not
depend
at
least
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
except
insofar
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
authorizes
the
laws
providing
for
equal
rights
which
--
on
which
in
one
sense
it
turns.
this
is
an
exercise
of
the
power
which
congress
had
from
the
beginning
to
provide
a
federal
court
trial
of
all
the
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
that
has
always
been
construed.
constitutional
provision
has
allowing
been
construed
as
allowing
removal
to
federal
courts
of
cases
in
which
the
federal
question
was
interpose
by
way
of
defense
rather
than
by
way
of
complaint.
congress
has
this
matter
of
policy
chosen
not
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction
generally.
here,
for
a
good
reason,
it
chose
to
exercise
it
in
this
area
of
the
attempted
decision
of
civil
rights.
also,
this
color
of
authority
clause
seems
to
us
deals
with
the
real
problem
of
today
and
a
problem
that
was
also
real
in
1866
when
the
statute
was
passed.
although
at
that
time,
there
were
other
problems.
there
was
the
problem
of
procedural
rules
that
did
not
permit
negroes
to
testify
or
permit
them
to
serve
on
the
juries.
and
that
problem
is
the
risk
of
an
imperceptible
and
therefore
unreviewable
as
a
practical
matter,
prejudice
that
may
well
confront
the
negro
or
those
who
sympathize
and
aid
with
him
when
he
is
prosecuted
for
conduct
arising
out
of
his
effort
to
assert
his
claim
to
equal
rights
especially
so
when
that
decision
is
made
against
an
existing
white
supremacist
establishment.
in
so
saying,
we
do
not
mean
to
confine
the
scope
of
the
statute
to
south
rather
than
north
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
practical
operation
of
the
statute
maybe
far
greater
in
some
areas
than
in
others.
now
the
defendant
may
have
transgressed
the
bounds
of
his
federal
privilege.
he
may
or
may
not
have
violated
the
local
law
with
which
he
is
charged,
but
in
any
event
he
is
entitled
to
removal
so
long
as
his
petition
for
removal
alleges
a
case
which
on
its
face
would
require
dismissal
or
acquittal
if
the
allegations
are
true.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
question
whether
the
allegations
are
true
should
be
determined
as
in
any
other
case
by
the
trial
jury
and
not
by
the
judge
preliminarily.
and
so,
it
seems
to
us
the
removal
remedy
was
designed
as
distinguished
from
the
habeas
corpus
remedy
as
distinguished
from
the
injunctive
remedy
to
simply
transfer
the
trial
to
the
federal
court.
now
that
it
seems
to
us
is
entirely
comparable
to
the
diversity
removal
situation
and
it
is
based
on
a
judgment
made
by
congress
as
i
say
an
unreasonably
that
these
kinds
of
cases
though
not
always
often
might
result
in
unfairness
to
the
defendant
in
exercising
his
general
jurisdiction
to
this
area.
the
congress
determined
as
a
matter
of
precaution
to
avoid
what
is
viewed
as
the
serious
risk
of
injustice
to
provide
for
removal
of
all
such
cases
on
proper
pleading
to
the
federal
court
for
a
trial
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
largely
what
i
was
saying.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
sir.
i'm
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
there
are
probably
several
distinguishable
situations
mr.
justice
fortas.
first,
i
would
require
a
very
much
more
detailed
pleading
than
perhaps
we
have
in
these
cases.
and
if
the
conclusory
allegation
if
that's
all
there
is,
is
contested,
i
would
require
that
the
petitioner
by
amendment
or
in
some
other
way
is
closed
with
particularity
exactly
what
conduct
he
claimed
he
was
engaged
in
at
the
time
that
makes
his
activity
protected.
and
secondly,
in
what
way
in
his
view
of
the
facts
he
did
or
did
not
violate
the
local
law
or
others.
but
once
he
has
fully
detailed
the
facts,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
matter
is
ready
for
trial
provided
that
his
particularized
version
of
the
facts
if
sustained
would
authorize
or
require
his
acquittal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
would
apply
the
same
rule
that
applies
in
all
other
removal
cases
which
is
to
that
effect
when
an
officer
is
--
claims
removal
or
the
revenue
officer
claims
removal
and
alleges
either
that
he
did
not
commit
the
murder
which
is
charged
against
him
or
that
he
did
so,
but
he
did
so
in
discharge
of
his
duty
as
a
revenue
officer
no
matter
how
strongly
that
is
denied,
he
is
entitled
to
trial
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
perhaps
on
this
one
point
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
amsterdam
never
sees
a
trial
in
the
federal
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
removal
is
all
about.
it
is
the
removal
of
the
case
for
a
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
under
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
may
have
misstated.
i
was
speaking
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
to
removal
under
section
2
as
we
see
it.
our
argument
with
respect
to
discriminatory
prosecutions
is
based
on
the
denial
clause
of
section
1.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
there,
we
would
have
a
preliminary
hearing
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
by
the
judge
in
which
the
issue
is
not
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
issue
is
unequal
application
of
the
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
mr.
justice
white
if
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
even
in
a
case
under
section
2
if
the
prosecution's
version
of
the
facts
makes
out
albeit
a
violation
of
the
trespass
law
but
at
the
same
time
conduct
which
is
clearly
privileged
by
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
federal
law,
there
would
be
no
decision
by
a
jury.
there
would
either
be
a
preliminary
dismissal
or
there
would
be
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
should
think
that
this
is
the
preferable
solution
in
such
a
case
is
to
leave
that
issue
to
the
judge.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
not
view
that
case
as
being
sufficiently
clear
to
fall
within
the
denial
clause
under
one
and
therefore
we
would
bring
under
two.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
insofar
as
they
sought
removal
under
the
theory
which
was
upheld
by
the
court
below,
it
would
not
matter
what
they
were
doing
and
they
would
simply
have
to
show
that
they
were
prosecuted
whereas
others
engaged
in
similar
conduct
that
is
whites
engaged
in
similar
conduct
would
not
have
been
prosecuted.
therefore,
there
was
an
unequal
application
of
the
law
as
to
them
and
that
would
justify
their
removal
under
the
denial
clause.
under
the
second
clause
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
didn't
(voice
overlap)
answer.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
assume
that
they
would
have
to
either
show
--
either
deny
the
guilt
of
the
charge
that
is
denied
that
they
failed
to
have
the
proper
license
tag.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
alone
would
not.
if
i
may,
on
the
one
side
under
the
denial
clause,
it
seems
to
me
that
their
only
claim
would
have
to
be
that
this
is
this
local
ordinance
or
statute
which
is
in
practice
not
applied
to
others
or
at
least
not
invoked
against
out
of
state
if
that's
their
situation
or
those
from
out
of
the
county
if
that's
their
situation
with
the
rigor
that
it
has
been
in
their
case.
now
how
then
this
goes
about
proving
that,
it
may
be
very
difficult.
i
really
can't
visualize
the
testimony
that
would
go
into
it.
their
claim
under
the
color
of
authority
clause,
it
seems
to
me,
is
quite
difficult
though
it
may
be
that
while
they
were
arrested
in
a
car,
they
were
in
fact
in
approximate
way
engaged
in
voter
registration
activity.
it
may
have
been
that
they
were
taking
people
to
and
from
the
polls.
now
i
don't
say
that
that
privilege
is
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
i
think
would
have
to
be
combined
with
the
denial
of
guilt
under
the
local
ordinance,
but
all
i'm
showing
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
under
section
2,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
have
the
entire
question
determined
at
trial
that
is
to
say
by
a
jury
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
is
assuming
that
they
could
particularize
which
i
find
difficult
to
visualize,
to
particularize
the
claim
of
exercising
the
right
--
advocacy
of
voting
while
driving
a
car,
but
they
might
be
inheriting
respective
voters
back
and
forth
or
in
some
other
way
engaged
in
civil
rights
activity
albeit
driving
a
car.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
provided
that
their
allegations
were
sufficient
to
on
its
face
make
out
a
claim
of
privilege
in
judge's
mind
now,
because
the
judge
views
the
petition
and
he
there
--
by
allowing
it
or
disallowing
it,
he
makes
a
ruling
as
to
the
scope
of
the
federal
privilege.
he
says,
assuming
the
facts
alleged,
is
this
or
is
this
not
federally
protected
activity.
now
that
may
be
subject
to
argument
but
i
don't
think
it's
subject
to
lay
a
testimony.
and
as
in
that
sense,
there
maybe
a
hearing,
there
maybe
some
preliminary
proceeding
but
once
the
judge
has
determined
that
if
true,
those
allegations
state
cases
of
protected
federal
activity
then
it
seems
to
me
the
case
goes
to
trial
before
a
jury
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
suppose
that
that
sort
of
evidence
mr.
chief
justice
would
be
relevant
in
the
removal
under
the
denial
clause,
however,
i
would
think
it
--
i
would
think
any
judge
should
properly
be
reluctant
to
remove
a
case
on
this
testing
out
of
personalities
which
is
a
delicate
matter
and
which
it
should
be
avoided
it
seems
to
me
if
it
all
possible.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
your
--
if
i
understand
correctly
your
honor's
question
of
--
i
take
it
to
be
what
would
show
the
discriminatory
application
of
the
statutes
to
such
an
extent
as
to
justify
the
federal
judge
in
halting
the
prosecution
after
removal
is
sustained.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
that
the
defendant
would
have
to
show
that
this
is
a
statute
which
show
that
some
period
of
time,
has
not
been
invoked
in
the
same
circumstances
with
respect
to
a
different
class
of
persons
much
as
this
court
found
with
respect
to
this
grading
statute
involving
cox
versus
louisiana
in
which
the
court
found,
as
i
remember
it,
that
on
the
evidence
--
in
the
record
from
that
case
that
no
prosecution
for
violation
of
the
parade
ordinance
had
been
known
in
that
community
in
louisiana
where
the
parade
was
not
by
negroes
or
their
sympathizers.
that
sort
of
evidence
i
should
suppose
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
removal
and
dismissal
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
basis
in
my
view
for
removal
under
the
denial
clause
and
as
i
say,
only
a
basis
for
removal
under
the
other
clause
if
the
defendant
denied
that
he
had
violated
the
local
law
and
showed
that
he
was
at
the
time
engaged
in
protected
civil
rights
activity
by
which
i
mean
activity
protected
by
law
providing
for
equal
rights
in
terms.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
that's
too
remotely
related
to
the
concern
of
the
statute
to
justify
removal
at
all.
i
would
not
think
that
case
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
these
matters,
i
suggest
to
the
court
which
need
exploration
which
need
to
be
articulated
in
the
lower
federal
courts
which
need
in
this
case
to
be
articulated.
here,
the
district
judge
dismissed
or
remanded
the
case
without
adverting
to
any
of
the
relevant
considerations,
but
simply
on
the
law
as
he
viewed
it
which
would
not
have
allowed
removal
no
matter
what
the
allegation
is
short
of
an
unconstitutional
state
statute
and
the
court
of
appeals
itself
did
not
discuss
removal
under
subsection
(2)
and
therefore
we
would
urge
the
court
to
accept
our
argument
not
to
attempt
to
draw
these
lines
because
they
are
matters
to
be
forged
through
judicial
experience
which
fittingly
belongs
first
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
think
the
paucity
of
these
petitions
is
excusable
here
at
this
initial
stage
of
the
rediscovery
of
the
removal
statute.
and
in
any
event
it
needs
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
your
honor
is
speaking
of
the
peacock
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
petition,
i
would
want
to
know,
was
the
judge
when
--
or
the
question
of
removal
was
before
me
in
what
way,
in
what
numbers
these
people
were
picketing.
i
would
want
to
know
for
what
purpose
they
were
picketing
insofar
as
removal
under
section
2
is
concerned
and
i
would
want
to
know
whether
they
admit
or
deny
violation
of
the
statute
with
which
they're
charged.
and
if
they
--
and
precisely
what
conduct
they
were
engaged
in.
i
wouldn't
care
so
much
about
the
allegation
of
the
right
that
they
were
exercising.
i
would
be
more
interested
in
the
particularized
statement
of
the
facts
so
that
the
trial
judge
could
determine
to
myself
whether
they
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
that
i
as
the
judge
could
determine
whether
assuming
these
facts
could
be
true
which
the
jury
will
later
test
if
federally
protected
activity
is
stated
or
rather
a
violation
of
state
law
which
--
as
to
which
there
is
no
immunity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
as
to
our
position
under
subsection
(2)
that
is
the
position,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
subject
to
it
because
it's
a
verified
petition
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury
for
alleging
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
his
right
to
trial
in
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
same
way
that
removal
and
diversity
jurisdiction
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
depends
on
allegations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
black,
defendants
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
more
than
that
mr.
justice
black,
the
defendants
will
remove
to
the
federal
court
only
if
they
do
have
basis
for
thinking
their
trial
in
the
state
court
will
be
unfair
to
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there's
no
advantage
to
removal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
are
some
defendants
who
take
seriously
their
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
mr.
justice
black
and
who
want
acquittal
and
to
who
inordinate
delays
and
inconveniences
are
not
an
attraction
if
they
feel
secured
in
the
local
court
they
will
get
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sure
that
your
honor
is
correct
in
assuming
that
many
defendants
will
take
advantage
of
it.
i
don't
know
that
it
will
reach
such
unmanageable
numbers.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
guilty
defendants
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
it
is
sectional
legislation.
i
think
it
is
permanent
and
national
legislation
good
for
the
whole
country.
there
is
no
disguising
that
what
motivated
statute
was
a
concern
for
the
civil
rights
of
negroes
in
the
states
involved
in
the
rebellion,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
it
should
not
and
cannot
be
applied
in
other
parts
of
the
union
when
the
same
circumstances
arise.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that,
mr.
justice
white,
must
abide
the
hearing
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
emphasize
that
the
remand
makes
a
big
difference,
the
terms
of
the
remand
makes
a
big
difference.
the
fifth
circuit
has
remanded
the
case
for
a
hearing
on
the
question
whether
these
were
discriminatory
prosecutions
and
that
is
all.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
it
may
well
turn
out
mr.
justice
white
that
some
of
the
defendants
will
be
unable
to
prove
the
discriminatory
application
of
these
statutes
as
to
them
in
which
event
they,
in
our
view,
should
have
available
to
them
not
a
dismissal
which
would
be
the
result
of
that
remand
order
but
a
trial
in
the
federal
court
if
on
the
more
particularized
petition
which
i
would
require,
they
can
show
that
they
were
engaged
in
protected
activity
--
activity
protected
federal
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
suppose
i
should
say
that
in
the
criminal
case,
it
seems
over
more
fitting
that
the
facts
should
be
tried
by
the
jury
at
least
those
facts
which
do
go
to
the
merits.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
turn
immediately
to
the
statute
and
to
the
several
sections
of
it
as
we
analyze
it.
as
we
see
it,
the
statute
states
four
separate
distinct
grounds
for
removal.
they
are
incorporated
in
the
four
operative
clauses
of
the
statute
which
we
label,
first,
the
denial
clause,
secondly,
the
inability
to
enforce
clause;
thirdly,
both
of
those
in
the
first
paragraph,
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
color
of
authority
clause
and
finally
the
refusal
clause.
as
we
view
this
case,
it
turns
on
only
two
of
those
clauses,
the
first
one,
the
denial
clause
and
the
third
one,
the
color
of
authority
clause.
now
counsel
for
peacock
also
invoked
the
other
two
clauses
in
this
case,
inability
to
enforce
clause
and
the
refusal
clause.
i
should
say
something
about
our
view
of
the
scope
of
those
provisions
as
well.
but
first,
let
me
distinguish
between
the
clauses
in
the
first
paragraph
as
a
group
and
the
clauses
in
the
second
paragraph.
the
first
paragraph
very
clearly
deals
with
all
kinds
of
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
denied
or
unable
to
enforce
in
the
courts
of
the
states
procedural
--
primarily
procedural
rights.
it
makes
no
difference
out
of
what
context
the
case
arises.
in
the
language
of
the
1866
act,
it
was
for
any
cause
whatsoever.
the
problem
dealt
with
in
that
clause
is,
as
mr.
smith
says,
the
unfairness
which
is
anticipated
at
the
trial
because
of
procedural
or
other
rules
which
may
put
the
defendant
to
the
disadvantage
at
trial
that
is
at
least
the
primary
thrust
of
the
first
paragraph
as
we
see
it.
the
second
paragraph
on
the
contrary
is
not
concerned
with
what
happens
at
court
or
what
will
happen,
but
is
concerned
solely
with
the
context
out
of
which
the
case
arises
that
is
the
activity
for
which
legal
proceeding
by
the
state
or
by
private
individual
for
that
matter
since
this
applies
as
well
to
civil
actions,
seeks
to
interfere
or
deter
and
those
are
the
rights
provided
by
the
substantive
laws
providing
for
equal
rights.
some
of
them
already
outlined
in
the
1966
act,
others
outlined
in
the
acts
of
1870
and
1871
and
of
course
subsequently
by
laws
like
the
public
accommodations
act
of
1964.
now
as
i
say,
we
argue
only
under
the
denial
clause
and
under
the
color
of
authority
clause.
within
the
first
paragraph,
we
do
distinguish
between
the
denial
clause
and
the
inability
to
enforce
clause.
the
inability
to
enforce
clause,
it
seems
to
us,
deals
with
an
apprehension
as
to
the
future
deprivation
of
rights
at
the
trial.
that
presents
the
question
of
prediction.
it
presents
a
very
delicate
problem
of
as
mr.
justice
fortas
put
it
i
believe
in
trying
the
state
court
in
advance.
it's
something
which
one
is
reluctant
to
do
and
it
is
in
our
view
in
large
part
an
explanation
of
the
line
of
decisions
cited
here
beginning
with
virginia
versus
rives
in
which
this
court
indicated
that
it
was
unwilling
to
make
that
prediction
in
advance
that
the
state
judge
would
be
unfaithful
to
his
constitutional
oath
unless
there
was
a
strong
indication
in
that
direction
which
this
court
found,
could
only
be
supplied
by
a
legislative
directive
to
him
to
deny
equal
protection
in
the
sense
of
equal
procedural
right.
now
the
denial
clause
has
a
different
scope
only
because
it
deals
with
a
different
time.
it
is
denied
as
we
read
it
means,
since
we're
talking
about
removal
before
trial,
the
other
type
of
removal
is
now
authorized,
is
at
that
moment
or
has
already
been
denied
rights.
we're
no
longer
dealing
with
the
prediction
of
future
events
with
the
fact
that
the
trail
judge
may
not
allow
the
defendant
to
testify
as
he
would
other
with
other
defendants
that
he
may
deny
some
other
courtroom
privilege
to
the
defendant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true
mr.
justice
white.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
attitude
or
the
approach
this
court
took
even
though
a
motion
to
quash
in
some
of
those
cases
are
actually
been
denied
with
reference
to
the
discriminatory
selection
of
the
grand
jury
was
that
this
was
still
a
correctable
error
and
that
the
prediction
that
we
justify
removal
was
a
prediction
that
the
court
at
some
later
stage
of
the
proceeding
or
that
the
appellate
state
court
would
decline
to
correct
the
error.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
white,
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
all
of
the
conduct
because
this
court
viewed
the
conduct
which
were
justified
removal
as
a
final
refusal
to
quash
as
it
were.
and
this
court
said
the
fact
that
the
motion
to
quash
has
already
been
denied
is
not
final.
it
is
still
correctable
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
appellate
court.
and
it
is
only
if
those
events
take
place,
if
the
court
persist
in
its
refusal
to
vacate
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true.
we
speak
of
the
denial
clause
as
applicable
to
that
sort
of
case,
the
sort
of
case
this
court
has
recognized
particularly
in
the
first
amendment
area.
and
most
recently
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister
where
the
institution
of
the
prosecution
of
a
formal
court
proceeding
is
itself
so
great
a
denial
that
even
if
acquittal
results,
even
if
conviction
is
accomplished
and
ultimately,
the
conviction
is
reversed
in
some
higher
court,
even
this
court,
that
will
be
too
little
or
too
late.
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
court
proceeding
has
already
denied
rights
in
a
very
immediate
real
sense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
those
cases
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
those
cases
have
been
--i
think
largely,
if
not,
entirely
confined
to
the
first
amendment
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
but
we
do
think
that
this
area
is
in
every
respect,
perhaps
not
every
respect,
in
many
respects
quite
comparable
to
the
first
amendment
area.
these
prosecutions
do
deter
the
exercise
of
rights
and
i
think
it
has
been
recognized
in
the
voting
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
here,
we're
talking
about
as
far
as
the
petition
is
alleged,
registration
for
voting
primarily.
certainly,
a
prosecution
of
a
prospective
registrant
tends
to
deter
at
least
in
a
community
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
know
that
they
were
all
prospective
registrants,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
some
of
them
were
sympathizers,
helpers.
they
were
aiding
and
abetting
the
registration
by
negroes
in
leflore
county
or
at
least
by
merely
judging
from
the
face
of
the
petitions,
petitions
for
removal.
but
the
allegation
is
that
this
was
primarily
a
voting
drive
that
the
activity
was
halted
by
this
prosecution
that
was
indeed
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
prosecution
and
it
is
not
unreal
to
suppose
that
in
the
community
involved,
they
will
be
a
repressive,
deterrent
effect
from
such
prosecutions.
let
me
turn
however
to
the
color
of
authority
clause
in
the
second
section.
there
in
one
sense
we
deal
with
a
much
more
restrictive
category
of
cases.
here
we
do
not
include
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
engaged
in
any
activity
other
than
or
is
prosecuted
because
it's
engaging
in
any
activity
other
than
those
specified
in
laws,
in
terms
providing
for
equal
rights
and
that
is
to
say
federal
laws.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certainly
not
in
the
latter
two
instances
but
it's
conceivable
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
have
difficulty
with
the
-
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
in
the
case
of
murder,
it
could
conceivably
be
a
case
of
self-defense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
charge
would
be
murder,
the
petition
was
denied
that
it
was
murder
but
would
admit
it
was
homicide.
one
can
imagine
circumstances
where
a
murder
case
would
arise
out
of
the
exercise
of
protected
rights.
one
can
hardly
imagine
a
rape
or
burglary
case
arising
out
of
the
same
activity.
now
as
i
say
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
on
either
of
the
clauses
that
i've
mentioned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
of
course,
under
the
inability
to
enforce
clause
if
they
were
the
kind
of
demonstration
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
that
satisfied
the
cases
in
this
court
to
rives.
and
we
don't
say
that
those
cases
should
not
be
relaxed
for
the
purpose
of
the
inability
to
enforce
clause.
we
do
not
think
that
is
the
necessary
point
of
the
decision
here.
but
you're
quite
right
mr.
justice
stewart
that
as
to
the
two
clauses
i've
mentioned,
those
cases
you
hypothesize
would
not
be
removed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
it
seems
to
us
that
what
we
contend
for
under
the
color
of
authority
clause
presents
the
classical
case
for
removal.
it
follows
all
of
the
prior
removal
statutes
in
committing
removal
on
the
theory
that
a
federal
defense
is
involved
and
that
the
issue
at
trial
will
turn
on
the
existence
of
a
federal
defense
based
on
a
federal
right.
indeed
the
constitutional
basis
for
section
2,
as
opposed
to
section
1
of
1443,
seems
to
us
as
directly
in
article
3
and
does
not
depend
at
least
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
except
insofar
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
authorizes
the
laws
providing
for
equal
rights
which
--
on
which
in
one
sense
it
turns.
this
is
an
exercise
of
the
power
which
congress
had
from
the
beginning
to
provide
a
federal
court
trial
of
all
the
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
that
has
always
been
construed.
constitutional
provision
has
allowing
been
construed
as
allowing
removal
to
federal
courts
of
cases
in
which
the
federal
question
was
interpose
by
way
of
defense
rather
than
by
way
of
complaint.
congress
has
this
matter
of
policy
chosen
not
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction
generally.
here,
for
a
good
reason,
it
chose
to
exercise
it
in
this
area
of
the
attempted
decision
of
civil
rights.
also,
this
color
of
authority
clause
seems
to
us
deals
with
the
real
problem
of
today
and
a
problem
that
was
also
real
in
1866
when
the
statute
was
passed.
although
at
that
time,
there
were
other
problems.
there
was
the
problem
of
procedural
rules
that
did
not
permit
negroes
to
testify
or
permit
them
to
serve
on
the
juries.
and
that
problem
is
the
risk
of
an
imperceptible
and
therefore
unreviewable
as
a
practical
matter,
prejudice
that
may
well
confront
the
negro
or
those
who
sympathize
and
aid
with
him
when
he
is
prosecuted
for
conduct
arising
out
of
his
effort
to
assert
his
claim
to
equal
rights
especially
so
when
that
decision
is
made
against
an
existing
white
supremacist
establishment.
in
so
saying,
we
do
not
mean
to
confine
the
scope
of
the
statute
to
south
rather
than
north
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
practical
operation
of
the
statute
maybe
far
greater
in
some
areas
than
in
others.
now
the
defendant
may
have
transgressed
the
bounds
of
his
federal
privilege.
he
may
or
may
not
have
violated
the
local
law
with
which
he
is
charged,
but
in
any
event
he
is
entitled
to
removal
so
long
as
his
petition
for
removal
alleges
a
case
which
on
its
face
would
require
dismissal
or
acquittal
if
the
allegations
are
true.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
question
whether
the
allegations
are
true
should
be
determined
as
in
any
other
case
by
the
trial
jury
and
not
by
the
judge
preliminarily.
and
so,
it
seems
to
us
the
removal
remedy
was
designed
as
distinguished
from
the
habeas
corpus
remedy
as
distinguished
from
the
injunctive
remedy
to
simply
transfer
the
trial
to
the
federal
court.
now
that
it
seems
to
us
is
entirely
comparable
to
the
diversity
removal
situation
and
it
is
based
on
a
judgment
made
by
congress
as
i
say
an
unreasonably
that
these
kinds
of
cases
though
not
always
often
might
result
in
unfairness
to
the
defendant
in
exercising
his
general
jurisdiction
to
this
area.
the
congress
determined
as
a
matter
of
precaution
to
avoid
what
is
viewed
as
the
serious
risk
of
injustice
to
provide
for
removal
of
all
such
cases
on
proper
pleading
to
the
federal
court
for
a
trial
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
largely
what
i
was
saying.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
sir.
i'm
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
there
are
probably
several
distinguishable
situations
mr.
justice
fortas.
first,
i
would
require
a
very
much
more
detailed
pleading
than
perhaps
we
have
in
these
cases.
and
if
the
conclusory
allegation
if
that's
all
there
is,
is
contested,
i
would
require
that
the
petitioner
by
amendment
or
in
some
other
way
is
closed
with
particularity
exactly
what
conduct
he
claimed
he
was
engaged
in
at
the
time
that
makes
his
activity
protected.
and
secondly,
in
what
way
in
his
view
of
the
facts
he
did
or
did
not
violate
the
local
law
or
others.
but
once
he
has
fully
detailed
the
facts,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
matter
is
ready
for
trial
provided
that
his
particularized
version
of
the
facts
if
sustained
would
authorize
or
require
his
acquittal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
would
apply
the
same
rule
that
applies
in
all
other
removal
cases
which
is
to
that
effect
when
an
officer
is
--
claims
removal
or
the
revenue
officer
claims
removal
and
alleges
either
that
he
did
not
commit
the
murder
which
is
charged
against
him
or
that
he
did
so,
but
he
did
so
in
discharge
of
his
duty
as
a
revenue
officer
no
matter
how
strongly
that
is
denied,
he
is
entitled
to
trial
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
perhaps
on
this
one
point
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
amsterdam
never
sees
a
trial
in
the
federal
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
removal
is
all
about.
it
is
the
removal
of
the
case
for
a
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
under
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
may
have
misstated.
i
was
speaking
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
to
removal
under
section
2
as
we
see
it.
our
argument
with
respect
to
discriminatory
prosecutions
is
based
on
the
denial
clause
of
section
1.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
there,
we
would
have
a
preliminary
hearing
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
by
the
judge
in
which
the
issue
is
not
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
issue
is
unequal
application
of
the
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
mr.
justice
white
if
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
even
in
a
case
under
section
2
if
the
prosecution's
version
of
the
facts
makes
out
albeit
a
violation
of
the
trespass
law
but
at
the
same
time
conduct
which
is
clearly
privileged
by
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
federal
law,
there
would
be
no
decision
by
a
jury.
there
would
either
be
a
preliminary
dismissal
or
there
would
be
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
should
think
that
this
is
the
preferable
solution
in
such
a
case
is
to
leave
that
issue
to
the
judge.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
would
not
view
that
case
as
being
sufficiently
clear
to
fall
within
the
denial
clause
under
one
and
therefore
we
would
bring
under
two.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
insofar
as
they
sought
removal
under
the
theory
which
was
upheld
by
the
court
below,
it
would
not
matter
what
they
were
doing
and
they
would
simply
have
to
show
that
they
were
prosecuted
whereas
others
engaged
in
similar
conduct
that
is
whites
engaged
in
similar
conduct
would
not
have
been
prosecuted.
therefore,
there
was
an
unequal
application
of
the
law
as
to
them
and
that
would
justify
their
removal
under
the
denial
clause.
under
the
second
clause
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
didn't
(voice
overlap)
answer.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
assume
that
they
would
have
to
either
show
--
either
deny
the
guilt
of
the
charge
that
is
denied
that
they
failed
to
have
the
proper
license
tag.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
alone
would
not.
if
i
may,
on
the
one
side
under
the
denial
clause,
it
seems
to
me
that
their
only
claim
would
have
to
be
that
this
is
this
local
ordinance
or
statute
which
is
in
practice
not
applied
to
others
or
at
least
not
invoked
against
out
of
state
if
that's
their
situation
or
those
from
out
of
the
county
if
that's
their
situation
with
the
rigor
that
it
has
been
in
their
case.
now
how
then
this
goes
about
proving
that,
it
may
be
very
difficult.
i
really
can't
visualize
the
testimony
that
would
go
into
it.
their
claim
under
the
color
of
authority
clause,
it
seems
to
me,
is
quite
difficult
though
it
may
be
that
while
they
were
arrested
in
a
car,
they
were
in
fact
in
approximate
way
engaged
in
voter
registration
activity.
it
may
have
been
that
they
were
taking
people
to
and
from
the
polls.
now
i
don't
say
that
that
privilege
is
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
i
think
would
have
to
be
combined
with
the
denial
of
guilt
under
the
local
ordinance,
but
all
i'm
showing
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
under
section
2,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
have
the
entire
question
determined
at
trial
that
is
to
say
by
a
jury
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
is
assuming
that
they
could
particularize
which
i
find
difficult
to
visualize,
to
particularize
the
claim
of
exercising
the
right
--
advocacy
of
voting
while
driving
a
car,
but
they
might
be
inheriting
respective
voters
back
and
forth
or
in
some
other
way
engaged
in
civil
rights
activity
albeit
driving
a
car.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
provided
that
their
allegations
were
sufficient
to
on
its
face
make
out
a
claim
of
privilege
in
judge's
mind
now,
because
the
judge
views
the
petition
and
he
there
--
by
allowing
it
or
disallowing
it,
he
makes
a
ruling
as
to
the
scope
of
the
federal
privilege.
he
says,
assuming
the
facts
alleged,
is
this
or
is
this
not
federally
protected
activity.
now
that
may
be
subject
to
argument
but
i
don't
think
it's
subject
to
lay
a
testimony.
and
as
in
that
sense,
there
maybe
a
hearing,
there
maybe
some
preliminary
proceeding
but
once
the
judge
has
determined
that
if
true,
those
allegations
state
cases
of
protected
federal
activity
then
it
seems
to
me
the
case
goes
to
trial
before
a
jury
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
suppose
that
that
sort
of
evidence
mr.
chief
justice
would
be
relevant
in
the
removal
under
the
denial
clause,
however,
i
would
think
it
--
i
would
think
any
judge
should
properly
be
reluctant
to
remove
a
case
on
this
testing
out
of
personalities
which
is
a
delicate
matter
and
which
it
should
be
avoided
it
seems
to
me
if
it
all
possible.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
your
--
if
i
understand
correctly
your
honor's
question
of
--
i
take
it
to
be
what
would
show
the
discriminatory
application
of
the
statutes
to
such
an
extent
as
to
justify
the
federal
judge
in
halting
the
prosecution
after
removal
is
sustained.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
that
the
defendant
would
have
to
show
that
this
is
a
statute
which
show
that
some
period
of
time,
has
not
been
invoked
in
the
same
circumstances
with
respect
to
a
different
class
of
persons
much
as
this
court
found
with
respect
to
this
grading
statute
involving
cox
versus
louisiana
in
which
the
court
found,
as
i
remember
it,
that
on
the
evidence
--
in
the
record
from
that
case
that
no
prosecution
for
violation
of
the
parade
ordinance
had
been
known
in
that
community
in
louisiana
where
the
parade
was
not
by
negroes
or
their
sympathizers.
that
sort
of
evidence
i
should
suppose
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
removal
and
dismissal
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
basis
in
my
view
for
removal
under
the
denial
clause
and
as
i
say,
only
a
basis
for
removal
under
the
other
clause
if
the
defendant
denied
that
he
had
violated
the
local
law
and
showed
that
he
was
at
the
time
engaged
in
protected
civil
rights
activity
by
which
i
mean
activity
protected
by
law
providing
for
equal
rights
in
terms.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
that's
too
remotely
related
to
the
concern
of
the
statute
to
justify
removal
at
all.
i
would
not
think
that
case
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
these
matters,
i
suggest
to
the
court
which
need
exploration
which
need
to
be
articulated
in
the
lower
federal
courts
which
need
in
this
case
to
be
articulated.
here,
the
district
judge
dismissed
or
remanded
the
case
without
adverting
to
any
of
the
relevant
considerations,
but
simply
on
the
law
as
he
viewed
it
which
would
not
have
allowed
removal
no
matter
what
the
allegation
is
short
of
an
unconstitutional
state
statute
and
the
court
of
appeals
itself
did
not
discuss
removal
under
subsection
(2)
and
therefore
we
would
urge
the
court
to
accept
our
argument
not
to
attempt
to
draw
these
lines
because
they
are
matters
to
be
forged
through
judicial
experience
which
fittingly
belongs
first
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
think
the
paucity
of
these
petitions
is
excusable
here
at
this
initial
stage
of
the
rediscovery
of
the
removal
statute.
and
in
any
event
it
needs
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
your
honor
is
speaking
of
the
peacock
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
petition,
i
would
want
to
know,
was
the
judge
when
--
or
the
question
of
removal
was
before
me
in
what
way,
in
what
numbers
these
people
were
picketing.
i
would
want
to
know
for
what
purpose
they
were
picketing
insofar
as
removal
under
section
2
is
concerned
and
i
would
want
to
know
whether
they
admit
or
deny
violation
of
the
statute
with
which
they're
charged.
and
if
they
--
and
precisely
what
conduct
they
were
engaged
in.
i
wouldn't
care
so
much
about
the
allegation
of
the
right
that
they
were
exercising.
i
would
be
more
interested
in
the
particularized
statement
of
the
facts
so
that
the
trial
judge
could
determine
to
myself
whether
they
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
that
i
as
the
judge
could
determine
whether
assuming
these
facts
could
be
true
which
the
jury
will
later
test
if
federally
protected
activity
is
stated
or
rather
a
violation
of
state
law
which
--
as
to
which
there
is
no
immunity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
as
to
our
position
under
subsection
(2)
that
is
the
position,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
subject
to
it
because
it's
a
verified
petition
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury
for
alleging
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
his
right
to
trial
in
federal
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
same
way
that
removal
and
diversity
jurisdiction
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
depends
on
allegations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
black,
defendants
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
more
than
that
mr.
justice
black,
the
defendants
will
remove
to
the
federal
court
only
if
they
do
have
basis
for
thinking
their
trial
in
the
state
court
will
be
unfair
to
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there's
no
advantage
to
removal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
are
some
defendants
who
take
seriously
their
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
mr.
justice
black
and
who
want
acquittal
and
to
who
inordinate
delays
and
inconveniences
are
not
an
attraction
if
they
feel
secured
in
the
local
court
they
will
get
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sure
that
your
honor
is
correct
in
assuming
that
many
defendants
will
take
advantage
of
it.
i
don't
know
that
it
will
reach
such
unmanageable
numbers.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
guilty
defendants
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
it
is
sectional
legislation.
i
think
it
is
permanent
and
national
legislation
good
for
the
whole
country.
there
is
no
disguising
that
what
motivated
statute
was
a
concern
for
the
civil
rights
of
negroes
in
the
states
involved
in
the
rebellion,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
it
should
not
and
cannot
be
applied
in
other
parts
of
the
union
when
the
same
circumstances
arise.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that,
mr.
justice
white,
must
abide
the
hearing
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
emphasize
that
the
remand
makes
a
big
difference,
the
terms
of
the
remand
makes
a
big
difference.
the
fifth
circuit
has
remanded
the
case
for
a
hearing
on
the
question
whether
these
were
discriminatory
prosecutions
and
that
is
all.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
it
may
well
turn
out
mr.
justice
white
that
some
of
the
defendants
will
be
unable
to
prove
the
discriminatory
application
of
these
statutes
as
to
them
in
which
event
they,
in
our
view,
should
have
available
to
them
not
a
dismissal
which
would
be
the
result
of
that
remand
order
but
a
trial
in
the
federal
court
if
on
the
more
particularized
petition
which
i
would
require,
they
can
show
that
they
were
engaged
in
protected
activity
--
activity
protected
federal
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
suppose
i
should
say
that
in
the
criminal
case,
it
seems
over
more
fitting
that
the
facts
should
be
tried
by
the
jury
at
least
those
facts
which
do
go
to
the
merits.
