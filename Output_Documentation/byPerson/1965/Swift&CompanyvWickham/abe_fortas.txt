mr.

justice
abe
fortas
your
clients
sells,
does
it
not,
a
number
of
products,
which
are
regulated
as
to
labeling
and
packaging
by
the
federal
government
in
one
way
and
by
various
other
states
in
their
different
ways.
for
example,
oleomargarine.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
your
position
that
in
each
one
of
those
situations,
and
i'm
talking
about
a
situation
where
there
are
federal
labeling
requirements
as
to
weight
etcetera,
that
the
federal
regulation
should
be
held
to
preclude
state
regulation?
justice
abe
fortas
will
you
please
tell
me
why
a
prior
approval
makes
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
issue,
that
is
to
say
if
federal
power
should
in
case
of
specific
labeling
requirements
preempt
the
field
to
the
--
so
as
to
preclude
state
regulation,
why
does
it
matter
whether
there
is
a
requirement
of
prior
approval
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
there
is,
there
are
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
are
also
some
statutes
are
there
not
in
which
congress
has
expressly
provided
for
preemption?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
sir,
but
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
my
questions,
you
are
inferring
from
the
fact
that
congress
acquired
prior
approval,
a
congressional
intent
to
preempt
the
field.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
condon,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
as
i
understand
it
the
new
york
statute
and
the
federal
statute
are
for
present
purposes
about
the
same,
that
is
to
say
the
both
require
statement
of
net
weight,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
the
federal
statute
makes
mandatory
the
ruling
that
was
made
in
this
case,
that
the
administrative
official
mr.
howell
or
whatever
his
name
was,
had
no
discretion.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
take
it
my
way
for
a
minute
so
i
can
get
your
theory.
now
suppose
that
the
two
statutes
provided
only
generally,
that
there
must
be
on
the
label
a
statement
of
net
weight.
now
absent
any
sort
of
interpretation
either
of
the
jurisdictions
concerned,
would
it
be
your
position
that
the
federal
statute
supersedes
the
new
york
statute
just
on
that
state
of
facts?
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
be?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
it's
your
position
that
in
any
area
where
the
federal
statute
provides
for
labeling
and
provides
for
the
statement
of
net
weight
on
the
label,
and
any
state
statute
which
provides
for
a
statement
of
net
weight
on
the
label,
is
constitutionally
invalid.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
glad
to
have
you
clarify
your
views.
my
question
did
not
include
that.
