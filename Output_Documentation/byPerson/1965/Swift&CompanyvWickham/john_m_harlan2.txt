[inaudible]
in
new
york
requirements
was
to
get
an
opposite
result.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
you
asked
for
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
that's
perfect
and
proper.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
complacent
as
to
which
way
this
case
goes
on
the
merits
or
in
other
words
if
you
are
told
you
have
to
comply
with
new
york
regulations
as
well
as
federal
regulations,
does
that
satisfy
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me,
the
government's
amicus
brief
as
i
understand
it
is
opposed
to
your
position,
in
other
words
they
suggest
affirmance
on
various
grounds,
including
among
others
that
there
is
no
preemption
here
and
that
new
york
can
consistently
with
the
federal
regulation
do
what
they
have
done.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
we
had
to
take
it
that
the
solicitor
general
is
speaking
to
the
views
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
thus
the
agency.
the
brief
is
captioned
as
brief
of
the
united
states
and
sometimes
the
united
states
disagrees
or
the
solicitor
general
disagrees
with
the
department
of
agriculture,
but
how
should
we
take
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah
why
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do
not
believe
it
does?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
what
if
it
did,
i
actually
think
that
would
be
a
very
great
weight
against
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
are
we
entitled
to
know
whether
this
does
represent
the
views
of
the
department
of
agriculture?
justice
john
m.
harlan

does
that
appear?
