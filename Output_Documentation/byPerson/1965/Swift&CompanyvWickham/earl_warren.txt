[inaudible]
legislative
history
of
this
labeling
act
would
indicate
that
the
congress
intended
to
preempt
the
field?
chief
justice
earl
warren
excuse
me,
we'll
write
that
down.
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
the
department
of
agricultural
or
the
solicitor
general
will
indicate
to
us
whether
or
not
they
are
in
agreement,
the
two
departments
of
the
government,
do
you
think
that
would
be
appropriate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
solicitor
general
will
do
that
for
us.

i
ask
you
before
you

know
anything
about
this
discussion
we've
had
here
whether
the
department
of
agriculture
agrees
to
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general?
chief

you
do
not
know,
right.
chief

earl

mr.

final
five
minutes
questioning,
and
if
you
would
like
to
sum
up

time,
you
may.
