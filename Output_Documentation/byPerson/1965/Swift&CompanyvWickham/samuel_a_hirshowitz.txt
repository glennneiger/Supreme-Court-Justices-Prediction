mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
went
to
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
are
interested
in
getting
a
decision
on
the
merits
by
this
court,
but
nevertheless
in
view
of
the
expression
of
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
about
the
jurisdictional
point,
we
thought
it
necessary
to
brief
the
point
in
this
court.
under
section
1253
of
the
code,
this
case
can
be
heard
by
--
on
a
direct
appeal
only
when
a
three-judge
court
is
required
to
hear
the
case.
under
the
doctrine
of
preemption,
this
raises
no
direct
constitutional
question
and
there
would
be
no
requirement
for
a
three-judge
court.
on
the
question
of
conflict,
in
this
case
it
becomes
apparent,
both
statutes
are
identical
in
language,
both
say
net
weight
and
in
an
order
to
attack
the
application
or
the
practices
of
new
york
state,
it
was
necessary
for
the
appellants
to
have
the
court
construe
the
interpretation
by
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
of
the
state
of
new
york
under
a
regulation
issued
by
him
pursuant
to
that
section
193
of
the
agriculture
markets
law.
so
you
have
two
ways
being
moved.
first
you
have
the
statute,
which
has
the
identical
language
that
the
federal
statute
has,
net
weight,
then
you
have
a
regulation
issued
by
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
of
the
state
of
new
york,
which
defines
the
net
weight.
then
you
have
an
interpretation
by
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
following
that
regulation
which
actually
is
the
point
in
controversy
here
that
brings
the
case
into
court.
and
as
we
read
the
kesler
case,
this
was
not
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court.
the
particular
phraseology
in
the
kesler
case
was,
if
an
immediate
controversy
is
not
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
states
statute,
but
merely
the
construction
of
a
state
law
or
the
federal
law,
the
three-judge
requirement
does
not
become
operative.
and
here
as
i
said
the
situation
falls
directly
within
the
language
which
i
have
quoted
from
the
kesler
case.
now
in
addition
to
the
attack
on
the
statute
under
the
supremacy
clause,
there
were
claims
raised
in
the
complaint
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
commerce
clause,
and
we
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
those
claims
were
insubstantial.
the
court
as
you
see
from
the
opinion
held
that
the
claims
were
unsubstantial
and
we
say
therefore
that
the
fact
that
a
three-judge
court
was
actually
convened
and
heard
the
case
and
ruled
that
the
claims
were
unsubstantial,
did
not
authorize
the
direct
appeal
to
this
court
because
the
cases
have
held
that
a
single
judge
compares
on
the
substantiality
of
the
federal
constitutional
claims
raised
in
the
complaint,
because
otherwise
any
insubstantial
claim
could
be
made
and
entitle
the
pleader
to
a
three
judge
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yeah,
well
i
was
just
going
to
say
the
only
language
which
disturbed
us
on
that
point
is
language
in
the
first
florida
lime
case
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
which
seems
to
say
that
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
or
the
issue
is
not
to
be
determined
by
the
eventual
resolution,
but
with
the
case
which
preceded
that
the
woolen's
case
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
this
court
said
that
the
fact
that
a
three-judge
court
was
assembled
and
after
a
hearing
rendered
a
final
decree,
did
not
authorize
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
the
way
we
rationalized
the
trial
or
attempt
to
rationalize
the
florida
lime
case
is
that
the
--
in
the
--
in
our
case
we
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
claims
were
insubstantial
and
that
the
fact
the
judge
krocker,
the
district
judge
assembled
a
three-judge
and
they
ruled
that
the
claims
were
insubstantial,
did
not
authorize
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
now
as
i
said,
we
are
just
as
interested
in
the
determination
of
this
matter
on
the
merits.
we're
just
as
interested
as
the
appellants
in
having
the
packers
sell
their
products
in
new
york
state
and
make
them
available
to
the
consumers,
but
only
on
the
conditions
which
would
protect
the
public
in
new
york
state
against
deception
and
entitle
them
to
information,
which
the
state
in
it's
consumer
protection
program
has
determined
that
the
consumers
in
new
york
state
are
entitled
to.
now
these
stuffed
turkeys
or
stuffed
poultry
in
general
are
advertised
at
say
$0.50
a
pound.
there
is
no
segregation
as
between
the
bread
which
goes
into
the
stuffing
and
turkey
itself.
the
housewife
goes
into
the
market
and
she
is
entitled
to
know
how
much
turkey
she
is
buying
because
that's
the
standard
that
she
would
use
in
the
dinner
that
she
is
preparing.
i
can't
see
any
reasonable
objection
that
the
packers
or
anyone
else
could
offer
to
giving
the
consumers
of
new
york
state
that
information.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well
during
the
course
of
a
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court
efforts
were
made
to
show
that
it
would
be
impracticable
to
comply
with
new
york
law,
but
the
proof
as
found
by
the
three-judge
court
does
not
substantiate
it.
it
would
take
exactly
a
fraction
of
a
minute
to
calculate
and
put
this
extra
weight
on
the
poultry
which
would
indicate
to
the
consumer
what
the
net
weight
of
the
poultry
is,
in
addition
to
the
information
that
maybe
required
by
the
federal
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
your
honor,
but
some
of
the
facts
i
intend
to
bring
out
would
indicate
that
the
ruling
by
the
lower
federal
official
and
department
of
agriculture
has
at
least
subject
to
a
great
deal
of
scrutiny.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
i
intend
to
bring
that
out
because
as
you
will
see
from
the
facts
developed
in
the
record,
it
would
be
difficult
to
believe
that
the
great
doctrine
of
preemption,
which
is
cited
by
the
appellants
would
deprive
people
of
new
york
of
their
right
to
have
this
information,
additional
to
which
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no
sir,
but
as
we
cite
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
that
would
be
after
judicial
process
and
we
would
naturally
have
a
remedy
in
congress
to
address
ourselves
to
congress
if
that
were
the
case,
but
i
just
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
all
the
steps
that
were
taken
by
the
two
packers,
armour
and
swift
were
without
notice
to
new
york
and
more
than
that,
the
individual
who
presumably
caused
the
disapproval
of
the
labels
submitted
--
the
applications
for
label
approval
submitted
by
armour
and
swift,
he
knew
about
the
interest
of
new
york
state.
he
knew
about
the
interpretation
by
the
new
york
state
official,
yet
he
says
in
his
testimony
that
officially
the
department
did
not
know
about
it.
so
no
notice
was
given
to
new
york
and
judge
friendly
comments
on
this
in
his
opinion.
now
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
howell,
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
the
department
of
agriculture
official.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
no,
the
interpretation
arose
as
a
result
of
a
criminal
charge
against
swift
&
company
brought
not
by
the
state
of
new
york
or
by
the
commissioner
or
at
their
behest,
but
a
prosecution
by
the
city
of
new
york
instigated
by
the
commissioner
of
markets
who
marshaled
the
evidence
and
prosecuted
by
the
district
attorney
of
king's
county.
after
that
prosecution,
the
packers
--
the
industry
tried
to
get
a
bill
enacted,
which
would
do
exactly
what
they
hope
to
do
by
this
litigation,
exclude
the
right
of
the
states
who
asked
for
this
additional
information.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
would
be
new
york
state
legislature.
the
bill
was
passed
by
the
then
legislature
in
1963
legislature,
but
was
vetoed
by
the
governor
as,
generally
speaking
as
harmful
to
the
interests
of
the
consumers.
it
was
after
that,
that
they
decided
on
this
course
which
counsel
has
candidly
set
out
of
going
through
the
motions
of
asking
for
this
label
approval,
but
this
witness
who
appeared
in
the
three-judge
hearing
mr.
howell
was
also
in
court
when
the
prosecution
against
swift
&
company
was
in
the
lower
criminal
court
of
new
york
city.
in
addition
to
which
he
said
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
interpretation
which
was
subsequently
made
after
a
public
hearing
by
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
of
the
state
of
new
york,
held
a
public
hearing
at
which
he
listened
to
the
views
of
the
industry
and
the
views
of
consumer
organization
and
then
he
reached
this
interpretation
that
he
would
require
the
additional
information
in
any
form.
now
we
submit
that
there
is
no
substantial
basis
to
the
appellant's
claim
of
preemption.
there
is
absent
here
in
the
federal
act,
any
expression
of
intention
of
congress
to
exclude
the
state
from
requiring
that
this
information
be
made
available
to
its
consumer.
the
rule
expressed
in
the
cases
that
--
is
that
the
express
intention
must
be
so
positive
that
the
two
cannot
stand
together
or
be
reconciled.
the
recent
cases
on
which
this
court
has
upheld
state
action
like
the
florida
avocado
case
and
euron
case
contained
the
statement
of
these
principles.
the
appellants
rely
on
campbell
against
hussey
case.
in
that
case
this
court
found
the
expressed
intention
of
congress
as
supporting
the
argument
of
preemption
and
this
differentiates
the
florida
avocado
case
from
the
campbell
case.
this
court
said
in
the
florida
case
that
in
campbell
congress
have
declared
uniform
standards
and
inspection
to
be
imperative
for
the
protection
of
producers
and
the
public
interest.
in
passing
the
federal
tobacco
inspection
act,
reference
was
also
made
there
to
repeated
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
necessity
for
uniform
standards.
this
court
went
on
to
say
in
the
avocado
case
that
even
though
the
act
involved
there
either
as
its
purpose
a
policy
of
establishing
minimum
standards
of
avocado's,
that
language
without
law
did
not
reveal
a
congressional
design
that
federal
marketing
orders
should
displace
all
state
regulation.
in
our
case,
the
explicit
and
stated
policy
of
congress
was
to
guard
as
my
friend
has
said
against
unwholesomeness
in
the
interstate
shipment
of
poultry.
in
the
entire
stated
purpose
of
the
act,
there
is
no
mention
of
any
concern
or
interest
in
the
establishment
of
weight
standards
for
poultry.
section
3,
for
instance
of
the
act,
which
is
the
declaration
of
policy
says
in
part
to
prevent
the
movement
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
in
a
designated
major
consuming
area
of
poultry
products
which
are
unwholesome,
adulterated
or
otherwise
unfit
for
human
food.
no
reference
at
all
to
any
requirement
for
weight
standard.
78
witnesses
testified
before
the
various
congressional
committees
as
to
the
necessity
of
the
federal
act,
stressing
poultry
communicable
diseases,
some
infecting
poultry
workers.
the
only
reference
to
weight
in
the
entire
act
is
in
section
8
which
specifies
that
the
container
upon
its
label
should
state,
"the
net
weight
or
other
appropriate
measure
of
its
contents."
there
is
no
discussion
at
all
in
the
committee
reports
about
weight,
except
a
single
reference
in
the
committee
report
in
discussing
section
8
and
merely
making
the
statement
that
it
contained
a
reference
to
quantity.
it
is
claimed
at
the
time
net
weight
in
section
8
of
the
act
is
indeed
and
beyond
plausible
dispute,
a
peripheral
aspect
of
the
act,
to
which
they
dissenting
opinion
in
the
florida
avocado
case
referred.
appellants
refer
to
section
8(a)
of
the
act
banning
false
or
misleading
matter
on
the
label.
nothing
in
that
section
of
the
act
excludes
the
state
requirements
of
an
additional
truthful
statement
of
the
weight
of
the
poultry
as
well
as
the
total
net
weight
required
by
the
federal
department.
on
the
contrary,
the
district
court
found
that
the
additional
statement
would
make
the
impression
conveyed
by
the
total
weight
less
misleading.
relevant
also
is
language
in
section
18(b)
of
the
act
that
in
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
this
act,
the
secretary
may
cooperate
with
state
agencies.
in
sum,
it
appears
that
there
is
absent
here
any
intention
to
interfere
with
the
particular
state
requirement,
stemming
from
the
state's
regulation
of
weight
measures,
which
as
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
shows,
goes
back
in
new
york
to
colonial
times.
the
official
inspection
mark
on
the
poultry
package
required
by
section
8
is
simply
inspected
for
wholesomeness.
i
find
no
provision
in
the
act
itself,
requiring
label
approval
by
the
secretary.
the
requirement
for
label
approval
is
in
the
regulations
and
there
is
a
section
in
the
act,
which
authorizes
the
secretary
to
make
regulation.
appellants,
however,
seek
to
buttress
their
claim
by
reference
to
these
regulations.
the
regulations
don't
change
anything,
the
act
does
not
define
net
weight
or
other
measure
or
its
contents
and
neither
does
the
regulations.
assuming
the
validity
of
the
prior
label
approval
appearing
in
the
regulations,
any
reference
thereto
to
labeling
is
to
ensure
the
appearance
of
the
package
--
on
the
package
of
the
information
required
by
the
act,
which
is
detailed
in
section
8
and
the
absence
of
false
or
misleading
information
banned
by
the
act.
the
regulations
do
not
strengthen
any
claim
of
preemption
or
furnish
any
support
for
any
ruling
that
the
statutory
words
in
section
8,
"net
weight
or
other
measure
of
its
contents,"
exclude
the
furnishing
of
the
additional
information
as
to
the
weight
of
the
poultry.
the
assertion
by
the
appellants
of
long
standing
departmental
interpretation
of
the
act's
language
as
to
net
weight
is
not
accurate.
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
act
was
only
enacted,
the
federal
act
was
only
enacted
in
1957.
it
appears
in
the
record
that
quantity
shipments
of
stuffed
poultry
by
the
appellants
date
from
1960.
the
present
controversy
with
the
appellants
arose
two
years
later
in
1962
and
not
criminal
court
proceeding
to
a
trial
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
new
york
regulation
precedes
it,
but
the
interpretation
by
the
secretary
which
is
under
challenge
follow
the
criminal
conviction.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
they
had
a
regulation,
yes,
which
was
--
there
is
testimony
in
the
record.
there
is
a
county
sealer
in
new
york
state
in
each
county.
the
department
of
agriculture
has
general
supervision.
the
county
sealers
and
the
city
of
new
york,
the
department
of
markets
and
flowers,
the
statute,
the
department
of
markets,
the
commissioner
of
the
department
of
markets
that
is
sitting
in
new
york,
he
read
the
statutes
as
section
193,
net
weight
of
the
poultry
as
meaning
the
net
weight
of
the
poultry
exclusive
of
the
stuffing
and
he
brought
this
--
or
he
instigated
this
prosecution.
thereafter
the
hearings
were
held
as
i
said
by
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
of
the
state
as
to
whether
he
should
formally
adopt
this
interpretation
and
this
was
--
i
believe
in
the
early
part
of
1963
or
the
latter
part
of
1962.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no
sir,
because
there
would
be
no
objection
by
new
york
state
to
the
passage
to
the
act.
consumer
organizations
in
new
york
state
as
well
as
elsewhere
would
be
fully
in
accord
with
the
act.
new
york
state
i
would
imagine
as
having
a
such
a
substantial
part
of
the
population
frankly,
would
be
a
heavy
consumer
of
poultry
and
would
probably,
although
the
figures
show
that
in
the
years
to
which
i
referred
1960
or
1963,
i
think
the
packers
sold
about
one
million
pounds
a
year
in
new
york
state
of
stuffed
poultry
on
new
york
state
and
possibly
some
of
the
other
big
states
that
might
be
a
market
for
that.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
the
poultry
inspection
division,
this
is
the
division
which
subsequently
disapproved
the
label
submitted
by
armour
and
swift,
the
poultry
inspection
division
in
the
same
period
approved
a
label
calling
for
the
three
weights,
not
two
weights,
three
weights
--
a
statement
of
three
weights
submitted
by
the
connecticut
fund
for
stuffed
cornish
hens
and
the
meat
inspection
unit
of
the
department
of
agriculture
at
the
same
time,
1963,
approved
a
label
calling
for
cornish
hens
which
is
also
a
combination.
and
approving
a
label
for
cornish
hens,
stuffed
cornish
hens,
the
poultry
unit
said,
“there
would
be
no
objection
to
showing
the
weights
of
the
stuffing
in
the
bird
if
they
were
shown
separate
from
the
net
weight
statement.”
so
therefore,
as
i
submit,
the
departmental
history
would
appear
to
contradict
the
assertion
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants
of
a
long
standing
policy
of
departmental
interpretation
of
the
term
net
weight.
still
more
demonstrative
of
lack
of
any
assistance
in
the
regulations
or
in
the
departmental
practice
to
the
contention
of
preemption
is
the
recognition
by
this
very
department,
that
additional
state
requirements
are
not
displaced
by
the
federal
act
and
regulations.
at
the
foot
of
each
printed
form
of
application,
for
label
approval,
appears
the
following
sentence:
any
approval
of
or
comment
concerning
this
labeling
material
or
the
weighting
thereof,
as
contained
in
this
notice
must
be
understood
to
represent
the
attitude
of
this
service
only
and
does
not
excuse,
failure
to
comply
with
other
applicable
federal
or
state
laws
or
city
or
municipal
regulation.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
appears
on
page
161.
it
was
run
into
the
record
at
the
161
and
the
swift
application
to
which
my
friend
referred
is
on
page
272.
the
state
requirement
for
additional
information
on
a
separate
label
as
the
appellant's
have
admitted,
acting
under
the
food
and
drug
act
was
upheld
in
savage
against
jones
and
the
subsequent
case,
the
corn
products
refining
case.
in
the
savage
case,
the
opinion
referred
to
the
object
of
the
food
and
drugs
act
to
prevent
adulteration
and
misbranding.
after
discussing
the
federal
acts
language
against
false
or
misleading
material
the
court
said
it
is
one
thing
to
make
a
false
or
misleading
statement
regarding
the
article
or
its
ingredients
and
it
maybe
quite
another
to
give
no
information
as
to
what
the
ingredients
are.
in
the
present
case,
the
state
as
has
been
stated
by
the
appellants
would
be
satisfied
as
in
the
savage
case,
by
a
supplementary
label
or
even
by
a
tag
attached
to
the
bird
merely
stating
additionally
the
weight
of
the
bird.
this
would
remove
any
possibility
that
this
additional
information
was
part
of
the
federal
inspection
mark
or
had
secured
federal
approval.
furthermore,
this
would
not
require
tampering
with
or
removing
the
federally
approved
label,
which
was
the
basis
for
decision
in
the
mcdermott
case
referred
to
by
the
appellants.
after
the
mcdermott
case,
this
court
decided
the
corn
products
case
to
which
i
--
which
i've
just
mentioned
and
the
court
there
specifically
upheld
the
right
to
require
additional
information
on
a
state
label
under
that
act.
incidentally
the
appellants
in
the
amicus
association
questioned
the
validity
of
the
commissioner's
position
that
on
authorizing
this
statement
that
a
supplementary
label
or
tag
would
comply
with
his
interpretation
of
section
193
of
the
new
york
state
agriculture
markets
law
and
they
get
into
a
discussion
as
to
the
validity
of
the
interpretation
under
new
york
state
law,
of
the
position
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture.
judge
friendly
in
the
three-judge
opinion
referred
to
it.
we
originally
in
our
answer
invited
him
to
seek
a
resolution
to
that
question
by
going
to
the
state
court
first,
but
they
declined
the
invitation.
at
any
rate,
judge
friendly
held
that
the
interpretation
by
the
state
commissioner
of
agriculture
was
a
reasonable
interpretation.
appellants
have
referred
during
the
course
of
this
argument
to
the
cardell
case,
a
case
decided
under
the
misbranding
provisions
of
the
food
and
drugs
act.
their
statements
and
their
brief
that
it's
dispositive
of
the
preemption
point
is
in
effect
extravagant.
court
--
the
case
simply
held
that
the
false
statements
in
advertising
accompanying
the
product
was
subject
to
prosecution
under
that
section
and
the
majority
held
that
both
were
integral
parts
of
the
offering
despite
the
time
separation
to
which
my
friend
referred.
nothing
in
that
case
does
anything
to
undercut
the
savage
and
the
corn
products
cases
decided
under
that
act.
while
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
decision
here
at
this
time.
we
should
point
out
that
there
is
no
showing
that
the
appellants
could
not
regulate
their
manufacturing
process,
so
that
the
tag
or
label
could
in
fact
be
added
in
new
york.
several
alternative
suggestions
present
themselves.
the
weight
of
the
poultry
could
be
put
on
by
an
indelible
stamp
or
the
amount
of
stuffing
regulated
that
was
done
by
the
shipper
of
stuffed
cornish
hens
who
had
an
actual
--
who
monitored
the
amount
of
stuffing
that
went
into
the
bird.
the
principal
reliance,
in
effect,
by
the
appellants
has
been
to
this
rejection
of
the
label
approval
submitted
first
by
swift
in
the
middle
of
1963
and
immediately
disapproved
by
the
department
federal
official
and
subsequently
in
the
latter
part
of
august
as
they
were
contemplating
this
lawsuit
they
had
armour
&
company
also
submit
an
application
for
label
approval
and
cause
it
to
be
disapproved.
and
so
let
me
make
clear
that
the
application
submitted
in
each
of
these
instances
by
armour
and
by
swift
were
for
approval
of
a
label
--
federal
label
containing
the
information
requested
by
new
york
state.
no
application
was
ever
submitted
by
the
appellants
to
the
federal
department
of
agriculture
for
approval
of
a
supplementary
label
or
a
tag
conforming
with
new
york's
requirements
and
there
is
no
occasion
to
--
at
this
time
to
predict
what
the
department
of
agriculture
would
do,
formerly
if
such
an
application
had
been
made.
so
that
the
argument
that
the
disapproval
by
the
lower
echelon
federal
official
establishes
a
conflict
falls
or
fails
because
no
application
was
actually
ever
submitted
to
the
federal
official
complying
with
new
york's
requirements.
moreover,
the
application
submitted
by
swift
&
company
had
contained
a
provision
calling
for
information
as
to
three
ways
and
new
york
has
explained
only
requires
one
additional
point
of
information,
the
weight
of
the
poultry
without
the
stuffing.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
first
answer,
it
wasn't
done,
therefore
they
can't
advantage
of
the
disapproval.
but
the
second
thing
is,
if
it
were
done
i'm
just
about
to
say
that
they
were
under
a
duty
to
do
two
things.
in
first
place
knowing
of
the
interest
of
new
york
state
and
the
fact
that
department
of
agriculture
officially
did
not
know
about
the
new
york
state's
interpretation
and
new
york's
interest,
they
were
under
duty
to
disclose
that,
a)
to
the
new
york
--
to
the
department
of
agriculture,
federal
department
of
agriculture
officials;
b)
they
were
under
a
duty
to
advice
new
york
state
of
the
situation;
and
c)
we
claim
they
were
under
a
duty
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
file
a
protest
and
secure
a
hearing
at
which
new
york
state
or
other
interested
parties
including
consumers
could
well
have
been
represented.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
the
section
provides
for
the
possibility
of
judicial
review
and
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
if
new
york,
yes,
in
view
of
the
fact
they
did
not
disclose
to
new
york
state.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
if
they
had
advised
new
york
state
of
the
situation
and
new
york
state
had
appeared
and
been
represented,
i
think
new
york
state
would
have
had
right
to
have
a
judicial
review
of
the
decision
of
the
department
and
the
case
would
come
to
court
through
the
administrative
process
instead
of
coming
hereon
an
injunction
suit,
which
challenges
allegedly
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
but
they
did
more
than
that
and
i
think
there
was
a
lack
of
good
faith,
evident
in
these
packers
in
not
advising
new
york
state
and
not
advising
officially
the
department
of
agriculture,
the
federal
department
of
agriculture
of
the
interest
of
new
york
state.
and
their
motive
for
it
was
they
were
just
going
through
with
the
motions
to
prepare
for
this
litigation.
and
in
the
record
appears
admissions
by
the
witnesses
produced
by
these
packers
that
they
never
made
any
tests
in
their
packing
plans
to
determine
whether
the
additional
information
would
present
any
manufacturing
problem
at
all.
nor
did
the
department
of
agriculture
direct
any
test
to
be
made
to
see
whether
it
was
practicable
to
do
that.
when
the
application
was
denied
the
department,
federal
department
of
agriculture,
poultry
inspection
unit,
used
reasons
which
were
established
in
the
record
in
this
court
by
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
produced
by
the
packers
to
be
without
any
rational
substance
at
all.
one
reason
was
it
would
lead
to
confusion.
second
it
said
it
might
cause
contamination.
all
these
reasons
were
explained
as
having
no
substance
because
as
i
have
already
said,
it
appeared
that
it
would
take
less
than
a
half
a
minute
to
add
this
additional
information
and
secure
the
net
weight
of
the
poultry
and
actually
30
or
40
minutes.
this
turkey
or
poultry
is
in
the
manufacturing
process
at
a
room
temperature
about
40
degrees.
so
the
fraction
of
a
minute
would
have
no
deleterious
affect
at
all.
the
case
here
is
somewhat
unusual
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
no
adverse
parties
there.
you
had
an
administrator
--
an
application
for
approval
to
administrator
by
a
person
or
a
party
who
wanted
the
administrator
to
make
the
--
to
disapprove
the
application
and
as
counsel
has
said
they
were
happy
with
the
decision
of
the
administrator.
in
such
a
situation,
there
is
no
true
basis
for
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
action
of
the
state
on
the
basis
of
this
disapproval
by
the
minor
federal
official.
as
i've
said,
while
this
business
was
going
on,
at
the
very
time
this
business
was
going
on,
the
federal
unit
was
in
the
impossible
position
of
having
to
approve
two
weight
statements
for
cornish
and
stuffed
poultry,
where
the
experience
was
favorable.
the
record
shows
the
experience
was
favorable,
that
there
had
been
no
consumer
complaints
or
confusion
or
otherwise.
nevertheless,
when
they
were
disapproving
the
application
for
label
approval
submitted
by
a
swift
&
company
and
not
to
be
inconsistent,
they
abruptly
withdrew
the
approval
of
the
label
of
the
cornish
hen,
the
stuffed
cornish
hens.
furthermore
the
witness
and
the
lower
echelon
official
of
the
poultry
inspection
unit
had
conversations
with
the
meat
inspection
unit,
with
the
consequence,
that
in
december
1963
at
the
commencement
of
this
action
that
unit
also
caused
the
approval
of
the
label
for
the
cornish
hens
to
be
withdrawn,
indicating
the
special
interest
of
this
particular
employee
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
which
i
said
a
little
while
ago
should
withstand
scrutiny.
it
is
our
argument
that
if
the
appellants
desire
to
obtain
a
resolution
of
the
assumed
conflict,
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
pursue
the
departmental
review
provisions
of
the
act.
that
the
issue
tended
by
them
as
to
the
alleged
conflict
was
not
right
for
judicial
intervention
and
we
have
relied
on
our
brief
on
the
per
curiam
opinion,
in
arkansas
power
and
light
company
and
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
myers
against
bethlehem,
particularly
the
arkansas
case
which
we
think
is
appropriate
in
this
instance.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
phrased
it
this
way:
“when
the
inconsistency
hinges
on
a
factual
determination,
a
citizen
desiring
freedom
from
state
regulation
does
not
discharge
his
burden
by
obtaining
a
letter
from
a
subordinate
federal
official
at
least
when
congress
has
laid
out
a
fact
finding
procedure
as
to
which
the
state
could
be
given
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
at
such
a
hearing,
it
is
quite
unlikely,
said
judge
friendly,
"that
anyone
would
reasonably
find
that
a
separate
statement
of
the
weight
of
the
unstuffed
bird
would
be
false
or
misleading."
we
note
that
the
solicitor
general
not
only
agrees
with
our
position
as
respects
preemption
and
the
other
constitutional
claims
advanced
by
the
appellants,
but
also
agrees
with
the
district
court's
view
just
expressed
and
adds
such
additional
arguments
which
are
not
contained
in
our
brief
as
the
public
interest
and
a
full
development
of
the
facts
in
which
we
fully
join.
the
responsive
appellants
is
indeed
a
confession
and
avoidance,
a
confession
that
they
wanted
and
welcomed
a
disapproval
by
the
subordinate
federal
official,
and
an
attempt
to
show
that
new
york
was
not
entitled
to
notice.
when
this
law
--
echelon
official
arbitrarily
disposed
of
the
matter
and
this
is
relied
upon
to
ask
for
equitable
relief
against
a
state
statute
we
submit
the
issue
is
in
fact
not
ripe
for
such
action
until
there
is
a
complete
factual
record.
since
appellants
will
not
in
fact
advise
parties
to
the
disapproval,
the
factual
record
could
not
be
made
without
new
york
and
any
other
public
interest
properly
given
an
opportunity
to
present
such
facts.
and
as
i
said
furthermore
since
as
the
district
court
found
that
no
application
had
been
made
for
approval
of
the
label
material
in
accordance
with
new
york
requirements,
the
question
of
conflict
does
not
really
arise
in
this
case.
appellants
also
relied
upon
the
commerce
clause
and
the
district
court
as
i
said
held
that
the
claim
was
insubstantial.
appellants
concede
the
right
of
the
states
to
protect
its
people
from
fraud
and
deception
especially
in
the
field
of
weights
and
measures.
the
case
of
savage
against
jones
to
which
i
referred
previously,
the
plumley
case,
all
of
the
cases
cited
by
us
in
our
brief
reject
the
commerce
clause
argument
advanced
by
the
appellants.
in
the
euron
case,
this
court
said
that
the
commerce
clause
did
not
cut
the
states
off
from
legislating
under
it's
police
power
even
though
the
legislation
might
indirectly
affect
commerce.
the
fact
that
out
of
state
processes
may
be
required
to
alter
their
processes
in
not
unduly
burdensome
manner,
as
found
by
the
district
court,
there
is
no
objection
under
the
commerce
clause
to
state
regulation,
especially
as
we
have
noted
in
the
field
of
protection
of
the
public
in
the
area
of
weights
and
measures.
in
the
florida
avocado
case,
this
court
said
that
a
state
may
impose
upon
imported
food
stuffs
a
higher
standard
demanded
for
its
consumers.
the
contention
by
the
appellants
in
the
amicus
association
that
other
states
may
impose
other
requirements,
supports
no
commerce
clause
argument.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
appellants
could
not
prepare
for
sale
in
new
york,
stuffed
poultry
in
sufficient
numbers
to
satisfy
new
york's
requirement.
as
we
have
pointed
out
the
federal
act
contains
no
mandate
for
uniformity
in
this
area.
moreover,
the
possibility
of
contrary
requirements
banning
the
additional
information
in
other
states
is
as
remote
as
laws
banning
compliance
with
requirements
against
discrimination
referred
to
in
the
colorado
discrimination
case.
we
can't
anticipate
that
any
state
would
ban
the
particular
information
required
by
new
york
state.
in
any
event,
there
is
no
proof
of
present
conflict
in
the
record.
finally
in
this
connection,
we
have
pointed
out
there
is
likewise
no
proof
that
new
york's
requirement
could
not
be
complied
within
new
york
itself
at
the
point
of
sale
by
simply
marking
the
poultry
with
an
indelible
mark,
setting
out
the
poultry's
weight
or
by
using
the
amount
of
stuffing.
the
commerce
clause
would
not
apply
as
held
in
the
armour
against
north
dakota
case
cited
in
our
brief
upon
the
principle
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
extend
to
interstate
commerce
after
it
comes
to
rest
within
the
borders
of
new
york
state.
finally,
the
claims
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
district
court
said
were
baseless.
upon
the
record
it
was
obvious
that
the
state
was
legislating
in
a
reasonable
manner,
in
a
traditional
area
involving
the
exercise
of
its
police
power.
the
record
showed
that
the
proportions
of
stuffing
in
the
bird
could
not
be
ascertained
by
the
consumer
in
the
absence
of
the
information
required
by
the
new
york
interpretation.
the
substantial
variations
of
the
stuffing
in
the
stuffed
turkey
processed
by
the
appellants
and
the
consequent
need
for
state
action
was
fully
established
in
the
record.
furthermore
there
is
no
basis
for
any
claim
of
discrimination,
the
requirement
and
the
commissioner's
interpretation
is
binding
upon
both
domestic
and
out
of
state
processes
of
stuffed
poultry
equally.
the
failure
to
exclude
tv
dinners
or
a
host
of
other
ready-to-eat
food
products
such
as
the
pork
and
beans
referred
to
by
my
adversary
is
on
a
rational
basis.
they
are
sold
as
units.
poultry,
stuffed
poultry
and
other
poultry
is
sold
by
the
pound,
and
of
course
the
principle
is,
an
accompanying
principle
that
the
state
need
not
cover
the
whole
area,
they
found
the
need
for
this
particular
type
of
regulation.
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
association,
they
take
a
contrary
position.
they
say
that
if
the
court
approves
the
interpretation
of
new
york
law
by
the
commissioner,
a
horrible
result
would
attach.
there
would
be
chaos
in
the
industry,
because
all
these
combination
products
would
automatically
become
subject
to
the
interpretation
of
the
commissioner.
of
course
that's
not
true.
the
regulation
specifically
excludes
those
types
of
combination
products.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well
they
say
they
haven't
--
there
is
--
and
i
believe
that's
accurate
although
there
are
rumors
that
some
stuffed
poultry
is
being
sold
in
new
york
upstate.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
they
did
not
obtain
any
stay,
i
don't
think
they
applied
for
a
stay,
i'm
note
sure
about
that
and
they
have
voluntarily
refused
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
take
this
process
through
to
the
department
of
agriculture
by
submitting
additional
labels
complying
with
new
york
law
and
giving
new
york
notice
so
that
we
could
get
the
administrative
process
and
judge
friendly
and
speaking
for
the
three-judge
court
held
on
that
point
there
that
the
case
was
not
right.
i
couldn't
pass
on
the
question
of
any
possible
conflict.
i
have
a
note
here
that
the
--
given
to
me
by
my
associate
that
the
solicitor
general
himself
is
willing
to
state
to
the
court
that
the
solicitor's
brief
in
support
of
the
respondent
is
with
the
approval
of
the
federal
department
of
agriculture.
