justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
would
have
agreed
with
you
if
this
had
been
a
final
administrative
action,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
at
the
end
of
the
administrative
process,
the
federal
authorities
did
not
let
you
put
this
information
on
the
turkey,
on
this
turkey
at
all,
are
you
--
and
new
york
wouldn't
let
you
in
without
it.
isn't
that
a
conflict
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
court
below
admitted
that,
that
was
a
conflict
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
at
the
end
of
the
administrative
process
this
is
--
that
the
administrative
officials
have
finally
determined
that
this
information
just
wasn't
going
to
go
on
that
turkey,
whether
it
was
on
the
same
label
or
a
different
label?
justice
byron
r.
white
meanwhile
you
are
out
of
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
go
on
to
say
that
net
weights
will
not
be
allowed
in
addition
to
judge
friendly's
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
go
on
and
say
that
net
weight
in
addition
are
barred?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
something
in
there
that
says
that
both
weights
won't
be
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
in
the
regulation,
but
there
is
something
in
the
letter
you
received,
then
in
the
testimony
in
court
that
it
wouldn't
be
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
make
the
same
argument
without
the
determination
wouldn't
you,
that
you
would
just
make
the
argument
that
the
states
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
all,
and
whether
there
been
a
determination
or
not,
new
york
did
not
exclude
your
turkeys
by
requiring
any
kind
of
weights
on
the
turkey.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
would
it
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
put
it
this
way,
what
do
you
think
new
york
would
have
said
if
the
secretary,
had
said
we
want
only
one
weight
on
the
bird
and
no
other
one,
that's
what
the
regulation
means
and
if
it
takes
the
regulation,
here
is
the
regulation,
what
do
you
think
new
york
would
have
said?
do
you
think
they
would
have
said,
you
stay
out
here
until
you
get
a
court
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
you
don't
really
know,
do
you
think
the
new
york
officials
would
have
said
then,
awfully
sorry
but
we
won't
stand
for
what
the
secretary
is
saying.
i
mean
if
your
choice
is
just
for
to
litigate
in
the
department
of
agriculture
or
in
court,
why
shouldn't
you
go
to
the
department
of
agriculture?
might
not
have
taken
as
long
as
--
how
long
this
has
been
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
got
heavy
stuffing
where
the
housewife
pays
more,
she
may
not
care
how
it
looks
but
she
might
be
quite
interested
in
how
much
meat
she
is
getting
for
it
instead
of
stuffing.
justice
byron
r.
white
meanwhile,
if
you
have
to
appeal
you
are
not
--
your
turkeys
are
still
in
the
plant.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
get
them
into
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
into
new
york
and
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
what
do
think
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
is
vis-a-vis
the
department
of
agriculture
in
its
legal
opinions?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short
let
me
put
it
this
way,
why
isn't
the
views,
why
aren't
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general
automatically
and
necessarily
the
views
of
the
department
of
agriculture?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you've
already
answer
it
one
way
by
saying
that
they
aren't.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
example
you're
talking
about
the
solicitor
for
the
department
of
agriculture
or
the
secretary
or
the
head
of
the
weights
and
measures
department
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
represents
the
legal
view
of
the
department
of
agriculture?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
can
you
say
that
position
of
the
department
of
agriculture
isn't
that
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
gather
mr.
condon
we've
had
other
instance
in
this
where
the
solicitor
general
got
up
and
told
us
he
believes
one
thing
and
the
general
counsel
of
some
federal
agency
takes
a
different
position,
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that's
happened.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
--
do
you
have
--
what's
the
basis
for
saying
this
doesn't
reflect
the
views
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
what's
your
basis
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
solicitor
or
with
the
secretary?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general
what
if
there
had
been
an
application
filed
for
a
label
with
the
overall
weight
on
it,
plus
the
information
that
new
york
requires
and
it
is
turned
down,
what
would
new
york
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
assume
that
the
hearing
had
been
held
and
there
had
been
a
determination
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
that
the
only
information
to
be
permitted
on
the
label
was
the
overall
weight
of
the
bird,
without
the
information
new
york
required,
would
that
be
end
of
the
matter
as
far
as
new
york
is
concerned,
except
for
an
appeal
to
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
require
swift
to
seek
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
couldn't
--
if
they
won
before
the
--
if
they
--
if
the
secretary
said
that
you
can't
have
this
information
on
it
you
would
require
them
to
appeal
at
the
court
of
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
your
preemption
end
of
your
argument?
