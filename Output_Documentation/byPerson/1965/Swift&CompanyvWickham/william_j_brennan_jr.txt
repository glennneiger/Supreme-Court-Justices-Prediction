any
express
statement
by
the
congress,
is
that
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
preemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
you
distinguishing
conflict
from
preemption,
i
don't
--.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
that
if
congress
had
said
so
explicitly
we
have
no
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
congress
i
gather
has
not
in
this
sense
said
anything,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
then
how
are
going
to
spell
out
that
nevertheless
that's
what
congress
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
does
this
mean
at
page
20
of
your
brief
mr.
condon?
as
testified
by
mr.
hebert,
deputy
director
of
the
poultry
division
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture,
dual
weights
which
new
york
demands
would
not
be
allowed
out
of
the
appellants
plants
in
wisconsin
and
minnesota.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
the
words
product
bearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
product
bearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still
--
that
doesn't
help
too
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
sense
i
get
out
of
this
is
that
somebody
testified
in
effect
that
you
would
not
be
allowed
to
ship
turkeys
from
wisconsin
and
minnesota,
if
you
had
any
label
which
complied
which
new
york
requirement.
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
how
it
would
be
a
violation
of
federal
requirement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
--
what
was
the
reason
judge
friendly
thought
they
had
to
exhaust
some
administered
remedy,
what
was
that
all
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
fellow
is
too
far
down
the
line,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
have
to
go
to
whom,
the
secretary
himself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
judge
friendly
--
well
i'm
understanding
had
this
in
mind,
that
it
might
be
that
if
you
got
high
enough
up
within
the
department
someone
would
authorize
you
to
comply
with
--
would
allow
you
to
comply
with
the
new
york
regulation
without
being
in
violation
of
the
federal
regulation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
don't
know
if
that's
so
or
not,
do
you,
other
than
this
kind
of
testimony
that
wouldn't
be
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
you
get
to
the
conflict,
kind
of
what
troubles
me
is,
why,
if
there
is
no
conflict
certainly,
if
administratively
the
secretary
of
agriculture
would
have
say
go
ahead
you
can
comply
without
violating
our
regulations
with
a
new
york
requirement,
it
would
mean
i
gather
that
then
your
processing,
you'd
have
to
setup
another
step
in
the
process,
but
that's
another
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
but
i
don't
see
why
--
there
is
no
conflict
certainly
if
the
secretary
says
go
ahead
and
comply
with
the
new
york
requirement,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can
understand
your
argument
on
the
so
called
preemption
side,
but
i
don't
see
on
the
conflict
side
that
whether
you
can
create
a
conflict
if
you
can
get
out
of
business.
as
mr.
justice
white
observes,
of
course
we've
got
somebody
in
here
who
has
testified
that
they
wouldn't
let
you
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
if
the
client
was
satisfied
with
the
answer
got
at
the
level
of
first
bureaucrat,
any
reason
to
go
beyond
the
bureaucrat.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
you
had
gotten
further,
all
you
would
have
wanted
was
affirmation
of
the
advice
that
you
got
at
the
first
level.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mr.
condon,
without
a
further
administrative
determination
in
the
department
of
agriculture,
which
as
i
understand
judge
friendly's
position
might
result
in
your
being
relieved
by
the
resolution
in
the
department
of
the
question
of
any
requirement
to
comply
with
the
new
york
labeling.
under
the
present
state
of
this
record
how
can
we
resolve
the
conflict
point
of
your
argument?
i
can
understand
that
on
the
preemption
point
of
your
argument,
we
can
say
preemption
wise
you're
relieved
of
any
obligation
to
comply
with
the
new
york
regulation,
but
when
we
get
to
the
conflict
side
of
it,
on
the
present
state
of
this
record
how
can
we
determine
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
what
that
deputy
director
or
whatever,
that
settles
the
question
that
on
the
federal
side,
the
federal
determination
is
you
don't
have
to
comply,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
who
would
have
this
knowledge
general
--
who
would
do
you
say
had
this
knowledge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
the
witness
i
mentioned
earlier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
say
is
that
the
record
shows
that
he
knew
of
new
york's
position
of
some
proceedings
involving
other
practice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
get
that
bill
enacted
where,
in
new
york
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
your
new
york
regulation
precede
the
federal
regulation
which
you
said
was
1950
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
no,
but
new
york
had
a
regulation
before
the
federal
government
entered
this,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
connection
with
the
federal
act,
did
new
york
appear
to
represent
to
the
congress
that
it
already
had
a
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
new
york
appear
to
support
the
federal
legislative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
primarily
because,
in
this
instance,
in
this
statute
required
prior
approval
of
the
label.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
last
question
mr.
condon?
i
notice
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
a
statement
that
dozens
of
witnesses
testified
in
support
of
this
federal
legislation.
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
anyone
appeared
from
new
york?
