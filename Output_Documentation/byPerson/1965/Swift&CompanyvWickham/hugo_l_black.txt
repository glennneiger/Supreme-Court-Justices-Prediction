justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
can
try.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
that
generally
a
good
reason
for
not
going
up
if
you
have
a
chance
to
go
up
in
the
case?
can
you
say
well
we
knew
when
we
got
up
there,
we
knew
it
required
valid,
but
we
know
when
it
gets
up
there
you
decide
against
it,
so
we
didn't
waste
time
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
any
difference,
but
was
the
legal
advice
that
we
have
no
right
to
go,
there
is
no
regulation
which
authorizes
to
go
to
anybody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
go
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
thought
the
secretary
would
decide
against
you
and
therefore
you
didn't
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you've
got
a
good
excuse
legalistically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
what's
the
practical
effect,
what's
the
practical
reason
to
give
new
york
for
having
this
requirement
about
the
stuffed
turkey?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
label
require?
what
is
the
label?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what's
the
reason
for
that?
what
--
there
is
some
reason
for
it
actually
speaking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
they
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
to
that
extent
you
would
agree
with
them,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
might
not
be
necessary
in
some
field
as
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact,
it
might
be
that
a
nice
fat
looking
round
turkey,
if
you
had
to
stuff
it
out
[inaudible]
it
might
look
different
to
the
customer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
trying
to
find
what
it
should
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
would
look
a
little
bigger,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any
attack
[inaudible]
against
the
new
york
statute
on
the
grounds
that
was
[inaudible]
protect
the
industry,
domestic
poultry
industry
in
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
great
deal
of
scrutiny
for
what
reason?
