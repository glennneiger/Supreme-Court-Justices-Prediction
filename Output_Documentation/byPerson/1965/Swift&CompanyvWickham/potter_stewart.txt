it
can
come
into
new
york
with
that
label
on
it,
if
the
new
york
label
is
added,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
new
york
would
not
require
the
deletion
of
the
federal
label
would
it?
justice

is
in

yes.

justice

i
didn't
understand
general
hirshowitz
that
the
appellant
was
making
any
claim
that
the
new
york
regulation
is
unreasonable
per
se.
justice
potter
stewart
but
maybe
i
misunderstood.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
general
hirshowitz
what
if,
instead
of
the
facts
we
have
in
this
case,
what
if
we
had
a
final
determination
by
the
department
of
agriculture
affirmed
by
a
court
that
the
federal
statute
prohibited
the
label
which
new
york
says
it
requires?
now
you
wouldn't
have
any
question
about
what
the
result
would
be
in
that
case,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
the
federal
government
would
have
a
right
to
deprive
the
people
of
new
york
of
what
the
commissioner
says
they're
entitled
to,
wouldn't
it?
