mr.
william
j.
condon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
comes
here
from
the
dismissal
by
a
three-judge
statutory
court
in
the
the
second
circuit,
common
district
of
new
york
of
a
challenge
by
appellants
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
statue
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
appellants
swift
and
armour
packed
frozen
stuffed
turkeys
in
their
plants
in
wisconsin
and
minnesota.
these
are
packed
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture,
under
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
and
they're
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
from
those
plants
to
the
various
states
of
the
union.
state
of
new
york
has
a
statute
as
part
of
the
agriculture
markets
law
regulating
net
weights
and
the
labeling
thereof,
which
provides
as
applied
and
agreed
in
the
court
below
as
proper,
requires
that
a
product
such
as
stuffed
turkey
be
labeled
to
show
the
net
weight
of
the
turkey
and
the
net
weight
of
the
total
product.
appellants
labeled
their
turkeys
with
just
the
net
weight
of
the
product.
these
labels
are
subject
to
the
prior
approval
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
of
the
united
states
under
the
poultry
products
inspection
act.
each
has
an
approved
label
showing
just
a
single
weight.
in
the
early
part
of
1963,
each
appellant
separately
filed
an
application
with
the
department
of
agriculture,
requesting
approval
for
a
label,
which
would
show
separately
the
weight
of
the
turkey,
the
weight
of
the
stuffing
and
the
total
weight.
these
labels
were
rejected
by
the
poultry
division,
i
say
rejected,
actually
the
application
came
back
commented
on
only,
there
is
testimony
of
the
trial
indicate
that
this
is
the
form
in
which
a
rejection
takes
at
the
department
of
agriculture
level.
and
following
the
rejection
of
those
labels,
this
lawsuit
was
commenced.
appellants
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
statute
on
several
grounds.
the
first
ground
is
that
of
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
alleging
both
preemption
and
conflict
for
the
federal
statue.
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
and
interferences
with
the
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
and
equal
protection.
now
three-judge
court
was
convened.
testimony
was
heard
and
at
the
conclusion
thereof
an
opinion
was
written
dismissing
the
complaint,
it
was
unanimous
opinion
by
the
three
judges.
at
the
outset
i
think
it's
necessary
to
discuss
the
question
here
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
the
district
court
expressed
the
view
in
its
opinion
that
it
seriously
questioned
whether
this
was
properly
a
matter
for
three
judges.
of
course
it
follows
from
that,
but
there
would
be
some
question
whether
it
was
properly
a
matter
for
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
the
court
of
the
view
that
if
the
problem
involved
only
that
of
supremacy,
that
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
kesler
in
any
event,
the
district
court
would
have
held
without
any
problem
that
it
was
not
a
three
judge
matter.
that
section
2281
of
title
28
of
three-judge
statute
would
not
apply
to
those
circumstances
and
of
course
the
court
noted
however
that
in
the
kesler
situation,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
writing
for
the
court
indicated
that
where
the
conflict
between
the
state
and
federal
statute
is
immediately
apparent
without
any
serious
necessity
for
the
court
to
construe
statutes
in
order
to
get
to
the
constitutional
problem,
that
in
that
circumstance,
section
2281
ought
to
apply,
the
court
--
judge
friendly
speaking
for
the
court
below
noted
however
that
in
the
kesler
situation
it
was
necessary
for
mr.
justice
frankfurter
after
making
this
statement
to
do
a
considerable
amount
of
statutory
construction
both
of
the
federal
act
and
the
state
act
involved
and
he
therefore
concluded
that
the
question
before
him,
that
is
the
three-judge
court
was
whether
or
not
this
court
had
been
required
to
do
more
statutory
construction
than
had
been
required
in
kesler
and
then
the
court
rather
neatly
side
stepped
the
problem
by
reference
to
the
lack
of
sensitivity
of
its
witness
paper
in
suggesting
that
we
appeal
to
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
event
that
his
determination
or
suggestion
might
be
wrong
at
least
no
serious
damage
would
have
been
done
for
the
litigates.
this
we
did.
now
looking
first
at
kesler,
i
believe
that
there
isn't
any
more
certainly
and
i
believe
less
statutory
construction
necessary
here
than
was
necessary
in
kesler.
in
that
case
you
may
recall
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
court
to
determine
not
only
the
meaning
and
policy
of
the
utah
financial
responsibility
act,
but
also
a
considerable
amount
of
effort
and
attention
was
paid
to
the
policy
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
act
and
indeed
as
i
recall
it,
the
dissenting
justices
didn't
agree
on
the
construction
of
either
one
exactly
with
that
of
the
majority.
so
that
there
were
serious
questions
of
construction
of
the
statute.
here
there
is
no
problem
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
the
new
york
act
at
all.
there
hasn't
been
any
question
about
it.
we
didn't
challenge
the
interpretation
of
the
new
york
act.
there
hasn't
been
any
indication
in
the
case
or
in
the
court's
opinion
that,
that
was
problem.
the
court
simply
indicates
that
this
is
the
way
that
act
is
applied
and
it's
a
perfectly
reasonable
construction
of
it.
there
wasn't
any
problem
involved
with
respect
to
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
to
be
sure
it
had
to
be
looked
at,
it
had
to
be
studied,
but
no
serious
problems
was
presented
by
way
of
statutory
interpretation.
there
is
some
and
i
do
disagree
to
a
large
extent
with
some
of
the
things
that
the
court
did,
but
overall
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
took
some
20
pages
to
dispose
of
the
problems
of
construing
the
two
statues
in
kesler,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
we
haven't
got
anything
worse
than
that.
we
don't
have
more.
however
my
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
think
that's
right.
i
don't
believe
however
that
this
should
have
been
properly
a
kesler
case
in
the
first
place.
i
think
that
the
determination
of
this
court
in
the
first
avocado
opinion
which
was
purely
a
jurisdictional
question
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
that
was
mr.
justice
whitaker's
opinion,
yes
sir.
in
that
case
it
came
here
on
the
pleadings
and
there
was
a
division
in
the
court
and
this
very
problem
of
what's
the
effect
of
a
challenge
to
the
constitution
on
supremacy
ground
was
before
the
court,
but
both
majority
and
dissenting
justices
approached
the
problem
on
the
basis
that
the
determination
of
this
issue
rests
upon
the
pleadings.
it
rests
on
the
issues
that
are
raised
in
the
pleadings,
not
on
the
determination
of
the
three-judge
court
after
it
has
heard
the
evidence
and
decided
whether
or
not
the
issues
raised
were
properly
proved.
this
is
the
problem
here,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
determination
originally
made
by
the
district
judge
to
whom
the
motion
was
addressed,
the
three-judge
court
and
judge
friendly
notes
in
his
opinion
that
judge
coket
at
that
time
couldn't
know
that
the
other
constitutional
issues
after
proof
would
prove
to
be
insubstantial.
but
in
the
jacobson
case
both
mr.
justice
whitaker
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
realized
that
or
at
least
seemed
to
recognize
that
the
problem
of
jurisdiction
is
determined
upon
the
pleadings.
this
is
what
is
presented
to
the
court
and
if
the
district
court
may
enjoin
the
conduct
complained
of
or
enjoin
the
statute
or
declare
unconstitutional,
then
that
three
judge
court
is
necessary
and
a
proper
court.
mr.
william
j.
condon
we
do
and
that
has
been
held
in
abeyance
at
the
court
of
appeal
pending
the
determination
of
the
jurisdictional
question
in
this
court.
if
i
may
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
controversy,
the
appellants'
claim
here
that
with
respect
to
the
problem
involved
in
this
case,
the
poultry
products
inspection
act,
has
preempted
occupied
the
field.
now,
there
have
been
of
course
a
line
of
preemption
problems
and
cases
before
this
court
almost
throughout
its
entire
history.
we
could
quote
the
language
of
the
various
formulas
that
have
been
relied
upon,
but
basically
it
seems
that
in
every
instance
where
the
problem
before
the
court
is
one
of
federal
preemption.
what
the
court
is
concerned
with
is
the
determination
basically
of
the
federal
policy
and
whether
or
not
the
coexistence
of
state
action
in
the
areas
involved
would
frustrate
that
federal
policy
or
not.
what's
the
federal
policy
we're
dealing
with
here?
first
of
all
i
think
we
ought
to
point
this
out,
that
the
problem
involved
in
this
case
is
one
of
labeling.
the
only
thing
that's
involved
is
what
is
to
go
on
a
label.
there
has
been
consideration,
there
has
been
discussion
at
various
levels
and
there
were
some
in
judge
friendly's
opinion
that
the
issue
is
one
of
a
definition
of
net
weight.
the
appellants
disagree
with
this.
i
don't
think
this
is
the
issue
at
all.
there
never
was
any
problem
about
what
net
weight
means.
net
weight
isn't
defined
they
say
in
the
poultry
products
inspection
act,
oddly
enough
it's
not
defined
in
the
agriculture
and
markets
law
in
the
state
of
new
york
either,
which
whole
purpose
is
net
weight,
that's
what
it's
regulating,
it
doesn't
define
it
either.
this
is
not
by
way
of
criticism;
it's
just
the
fact
that
net
weight
isn't
a
problem
to
anybody
who
is
concerned
with
weights.
we
have
gross,
tare
and
net,
the
people
know
what
they
mean.
what's
involved
here
is
what
net
weight
is
to
appear
on
the
label.
how
are
we
going
to
label
the
product
and
what
is
involved
simply
from
the
standpoint
of
this
federal
supremacy
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
in
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
has
preempted
the
field
of
what
is
to
appear
on
a
label
of
a
poultry
product
which
is
subject
to
this
act.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
i
think
that
the
court
had
to
reach
before
it
could
get
to
that
one.
i
think
the
court
had
to
dispose
of
the
question
of
preemption
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
has
preempted
the
area
of
the
labels
on
these
products,
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
is
a
conflict
or
not.
the
conflict
problem
only
arises
when
you
say
yes
the
two
may
exist
side
by
side,
but
not
if
there
is
a
conflict.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
as
i
read
the
opinion
your
honor
i
believe
that
he
had
first
decided
that
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
does
not
preempt
this
field.
then
he
moved
into
the
issue
of
conflict
and
i
think
then
the
burden
of
his
holding
was
this
--
the
record
isn't
right
for
determination
on
conflict.
for
this
reason
there
had
been
a
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
as
he
saw
it.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
i
think
that
the
court
did
reach
it,
if
your
honor
please.
i
believe
the
court
did
reach
it,
but
i
think
that
the
three
of
them
they
reached
the
question
of
preemption
and
found
that
it
didn't
exist.
it
said
congress
hasn't
occupied
the
field
and
then
moved
on
to
--.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no
sir.
mr.
william
j.
condon
the
way
i
distinguish
is
this,
that
are
cases,
we
know
cases
for
example
the
campbell
against
hussey
situation,
the
tobacco
inspection
cases,
tobacco
labeling,
where
they
--
the
holding
is
that
when
congress
has
acted
then
there
is
no
room
for
state
action,
you
find
this
in
the
interstate
commerce
cases
too.
the
issue
i
think
was
argued
here
yesterday
in
connection
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
well
that
can
the
two
coexist
even
though
they
touch
different
things,
even
if
they
don't
conflict
with
one
another?
is
it
the
policy
that
congress
wants
to
--
wants
its
agency
to
do
it
all.
on
the
other
hand,
even
though
the
two
may
coexist,
take
for
example
the
savage
and
jones
and
mcdermott
and
wisconsin
situation,
where
in
savage
and
jones,
the
court
held
that
there
maybe
state
regulation
of
labeling
even
though
the
food
and
drugs
act
had
something
to
do
with
labeling
at
that
time,
but
then
the
mcdermott
situation
came
along
and
said
yes
there
maybe
state
action,
but
not
if
it
conflicts
with
the
action
of
congress
with
the
federal
action
and
this
is
where
i
am
separating,
this
is
how
i
developed
the
dichotomy.
it's
both
under
the
supremacy
clause,
it
is
to
be
sure
we
are
talking
about
supremacy,
but
in
the
one
case
if
there
is
preemption
since
what
i
tried
to
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
if
there
is
preemption,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
is
conflict
or
not.
our
original
label
because
it
bore
the
federal
approval
would
be
adequate
to
go
anywhere
and
the
states
would
not
be
able
to
do
anything
about
it,
with
respect
to
the
text
and
the
content
of
the
label.
we
are
careful
to
keep
it
as
narrow
as
i
can
with
that
in
regard
to
this
because
there
is
no
claim
that
the
states
can't
regulate
false
weights,
improper
weights,
if
they
don't
get
enough
in
the
package.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
the
fact
that
the
state
retains
the
power
to
do
this,
but
no
false
or
improper
weights
involved
in
this
lawsuit.
the
only
thing
that's
involved
in
here
is
the
manner
in
which
it's
labeled.
now,
we
claim
that
there
is
federal
preemption.
we
claim
that
congress
has
intended
that
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
occupy
the
field
with
respect
to
the
text,
the
form
and
content
of
labels
on
poultry
products
under
the
act
and
we
find
that
policy
not
because
they
used
the
words,
the
magic
words
to
say
so
and
not
because
they
used
uniform
as
was
the
case
in
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
there
wouldn't
be
a
problem,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
think
we
have
to
define
it
from
what
congress
has
done.
this
is
what
--
this
is
the
problem
that
comes
to
the
court.
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
you
look
at
what
congress
has
done
and
you
try
to
determine
whether
or
not
any
other
holding
would
be
consistent
with
the
congressional
policy,
whether
they
can
consistently
do
what
they
try
to
do.
in
this
statute,
the
policy
of
the
act,
i
think
with
respect
to
this
aspect
can
be
defined
from
a
look
at
what
the
congress
has
done.
the
definition
section,
for
example,
where
they
define
immediate
containers
and
it's
clear
that
this
act
applies
to
immediate
containers
and
an
immediate
container
is
defined
to
include
a
consumer
package
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
we're
talking
about
a
turkey
that's
wrapped
up
in
a
package
that's
going
to
the
consumer
and
congress
defines
that
in
here,
has
some
reason
for
this.
it
provides
for
prior
approval
of
labels
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
specifically
for
the
prior
approval
of
labels,
which
are
going
on
consumer
packages.
now,
congress
has
said
this,
the
regulations
say
this,
they
make
it
plain,
that
before
we
may
use
a
label
on
any
poultry
product
subject
to
this
act,
we
must
first
submit
it
and
incidentally
the
regulations
are
very
plain,
we
are
not
allowed
to
print
it
until
after
it's
been
approved.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
must
approve
the
label
and
this
label
must
be
on
the
product
before
we
can
ship
it
out
of
the
plant.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
act,
see
what
the
court
and
what
congress
has
done
in
the
statute,
that
at
the
heart
of
it
there
are
all
kinds
of
regulatory
provisions
but
the
heart
of
the
statute
is
contained
in
section
6,
7,
and
8.
section
6
provides
for
the
inspection
of
the
product,
section
7
provides
for
the
sanitary
facilities
and
the
practices,
section
8
for
labeling.
congress
takes
up
the
three
of
them
with
no
differentiation,
no
distinction,
there
is
no
categorization
or
weight
attached
to
one
or
the
other.
now
the
argument
is
made
that
it's
clear
from
the
declaration
to
policy
on
the
legislative
findings
of
congress
sections
3
and
2
in
the
inverse
order,
so
all
congress
was
concerned
with
was
on
unwholesome
poultry
and
the
desire
not
to
have
unwholesome
poultry
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
well,
this
maybe
so,
this
is
what
congress
has
said,
this
is
their
policy,
it's
what
they
are
trying
to
do,
is
control
the
interstate
shipment
of
poultry,
so
that
they
won't
have
unwholesome
poultry
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
now
then,
that's
what
they
intend
to
by
this
statute
and
then
they
sat
down
and
wrote
the
statute
and
they
wrote
in
section
6,
in
order
to
effectuate
these
policies
we
are
going
to
have
anti
and
postmortem
inspection
of
the
products
of
the
plant,
they
wrote
in
section
7
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
respect
to
sanitary
facilities
and
they
wrote
in
section
8
what
they
require
with
respect
to
labels.
now
it
is
a
legislative
certainly
not
a
judicial
determination
whether
or
not
the
means
which
congress
has
adopted
in
the
statute
are
the
best
or
the
most
appropriate
means
of
effectuating
the
purposes
announced.
but
the
fact
is
however
that
this
is
what
congress
has
done
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purposes
described
in
the
beginning
of
the
statute.
now
i
know
that
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
brief
as
amicus
curiae
and
has
taken
the
position
that
this
statute
does
not
preempt
the
field
and
in
his
brief
the
solicitor
general
on
the
page
19,
quotes
with
rather
substantial
ellipsis
from
the
–
one
of
the
house
reports,
when
he
says
that
net
weight
labels
was
merely
intended
to
“ellipsis”,
round
out,
the
acts'
principle
purposes.
on
the
page
33
of
the
appellant's
brief,
the
same
quote
appears
only
without
quite
so
much
of
an
ellipsis.
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
moving
over
on
to
the
second
page.
if
the
purpose
is
to
establish
a
system
of
compulsory
inspection
poultry
and
poultry
products
in
interstate
commerce,
moving
down
the
last
sentence,
such
inspection
would
be
rounded
out
by
requirements
as
to
the
maintains
of
sanitary
facilities
and
the
practices,
and
as
to
correct
an
informative
labeling
in
products.
now
i
presume
that
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
intend
us
to
conclude
from
this
that
the
maintenance
of
sanitary
facilities
and
practices
is
as
incidental
to
the
wholesomeness
and
therefore
the
furtherance
of
the
congressional
polices
as
is
that
net
weight
labeling.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
congress
has
chosen
to
regulate
all
three
areas
in
order
to
establish
--
develop
its
purpose.
it's
not
then
for
the
court
to
say
whether
this
was
appropriate
or
not.
before
i
leave
this
question
of
preemption,
i'd
like
to
refer
again
to
an
argument
raised
by
the
solicitor
general.
because
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
makes
reference
to
the
exemption
from
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
which
that
act
contains
for
products
subject
to
the
meat
inspection
act
and
the
substantially
identical
language
which
appears
in
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
in
19a.
the
argument
runs
that
under
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
this
court
has
always
held
that
the
state
is
free
to
regulate
with
respect
to
labels.
it
follows
and
any
such
case
under
the
meat
--
under
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
which
involved
federal
inspected
meat,
the
cockman
case
and
he
moves
from
there
to
indicate
that
if
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
applies
to
poultry,
since
the
exempt
to
meat,
since
the
exemptions
are
same
under
the
poultry,
then
likewise
it
would
apply
to
poultry
after
the
interstate
shipment
has
concluded
and
that
being
so,
then
obviously
the
states
may
do
what
they
want
after
the
interstate
shipment
is
over.
and
i
call
the
attention
of
court
the
argument
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is
that
i
think
the
statement
originally
that
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
did
not
prevent
state
action
is
a
grutalative
statement.
that
the
cases
cited
in
support
of
that
proposition
are
all
cases
involving
the
food
and
drugs
act
of
1906.
so
far
as
i
know
this
question
hasn't
been
presented
to
this
court
with
respect
to
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
of
1938.
now
this
has
not
suggested
necessarily
the
court
would
reach
a
different
result,
but
it
is
to
suggest
that
it
need
not
necessarily
reach
the
same
result
because
the
labeling
provisions
and
requirements
under
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
of
1938
are
substantially
more
detailed
and
more
stringent
and
in
many
areas
perhaps
preemptive.
certainly
i
think
this
must
be
true
with
respective
prescription
drugs
and
things
of
that
sort,
but
in
any
event
the
cases
don't
support
the
principle.
this
is
the
basis
for
this
argument.
the
second
leg
of
the
argument
i
believe
is
the
cockman
case
and
as
i
say
that
was
a
prosecution
with
criminal
case,
the
prosecution
for
removing
labels
from
federally
inspected
meat
after
the
shipment
in
interstate
commerce
was
over.
with
respect
to
that
case,
i
can
only
say
this.
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
the
question
of
the
exemption
from
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
was
never
raised.
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
discuss
it
and
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
filed
with
this
court,
the
petitioner
doesn't
raise
it
either.
now
the
case
certainly
is
something
less
than
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
applies
immediately
to
meat
products
when
their
interstate
movement
is
through.
and
finally
its
the
language
of
the
exemption
as
written
into
the
statute,
section
19(a)
is
that
secretary's
authority
should
be
exclusive
in
poultry
and
poultry
products
should
be
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
as
amended
to
the
extent
of
the
application
or
the
extension
thereto,
of
the
provisions
of
this
act.
well
then
it
begs
the
question,
and
question
is
how
far
does
this
act
extend
and
if
this
act
as
i
contend
does
extend
in
the
case
of
consumer
packages
which
are
regulated
in
the
statue,
which
are
prescribed
as
to
their
labeling
in
the
statute
and
the
regulations
and
for
which
the
labels
must
be
approved
by
the
sectary
before
they
can
be
put
on
the
product
and
if
as
i
contend
this
act
carries
to
the
consumer
with
respect
to
that
label,
then
it
begs
the
question
to
say
that,
this
exemption
is
the
same
as
for
meat,
because
it
is
as
far
as
the
exemption
is
concerned,
but
certainly
that
doesn't
define
the
extension
of
this
act,
to
determine
where
the
exemption
begins
and
ends.
the
other
half
of
the
supremacy
argument,
the
one
which
gave
everybody
so
much
trouble
and
certainly
did
the
court
below
and
that's
the
question
of
the
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
i
don't
think
there
is
much
very
much
doubt
that
factually
we
have
a
conflict
as
of
the
moment
we
have
a
product
with
a
label
which
is
approved
by
the
department
of
agriculture,
which
we
sell
everywhere
in
the
united
states
except
the
state
of
new
york.
that
product
cannot
come
into
new
york
with
that
label
on
it.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
as
a
practical
matter
i
mean
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
oh,
no
it
has
--
it
requires
more,
but
i
think
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out
and
as
i've
tried
to,
as
a
practical
matter
the
only
place
this
product
can
be
labeled
to
satisfy
new
york
is
in
the
plant
in
minnesota.
mr.
william
j.
condon
you
can't
do
it
anywhere
else,
that's
the
only
place
where
we've
got
the
information
and
the
weight.
so
the
question
really
comes
what
do
we
have
to
put
on
the
product
in
minnesota?
now
new
york
says
we
have
to
put
on
that
product
in
minnesota
two
weights,
weight
of
the
turkey,
the
weight
of
the
product.
department
of
agriculture
has
turned
down
our
application
for
a
label,
which
would
satisfy
new
york
requirements.
and
this
raises
the
question
now
of
--
two
questions
really,
the
court
below
indicated
first
of
all
that
we
could
use
a
supplemental
label.
and
this
way
everybody
would
be
happy,
but
there
are
one
or
two
things
wrong
with
that,
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
court
below
unduly
restricted
the
definition
of
label
in
the
statute.
as
the
label
as
you
know
and
this
poultry
products
inspection
act
is
defined
to
include
both
the
definition
of
label
and
the
definition
of
labeling
from
the
food
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
they
were
lifted
banally
and
made
into
one
definition
and
that's
any
written,
printed
or
graphic
material
on
the
product,
on
the
label
or
accompanying
such
product.
now
this
court
has
already
defined
what
accompanying
such
product
means
as
those
words
were
used
in
the
food
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
in
the
cardell
case,
you
may
recall
cardell
against
the
united
states,
a
criminal
prosecution
for
misbranding
a
product
when
introduced
into
interstate
commerce,
301
food
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
and
this
court
held
that,
that
product
was
misbranded
when
the
misrepresentation,
the
false
misleading
material
followed
the
product
in
interstate
commerce
by
as
much
as
18
months.
so
that
there
isn't
any
way
really
that
we
can
have
additional
information
to
go
with
the
turkey
even
if
it
were
physically
possible
to
do
it
and
practical.
there
isn't
anyway
we
could
do
it
without
it
being
part
of
the
label
and
therefore
subject
to
the
prior
approval
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know
if
they
would
or
not
because
the
court
below
disposed
of
all
of
these
things
and
finally
said,
but
we've
got
here
a
civilian
federal
official.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
because
the
court
below
did
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
on
this
possibility
of
a
supplemental
label.
it
also
apparently
defined
the,
what
i
call
the
preempted
area.
you
see
they
recognize
a
certain
amount
of
preemption
by
saying
that
what
you
put
on
in
this
supplemental
label
can
go
there
as
wrong
as
it's
not
on
that
part
of
the
federal
label,
which
would
imply
federal
approval.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
think
if
it
meant
plain
enough,
surely
the
court
below
would
have
recognized
the
conflict.
yes
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
j.
condon
first
of
all
i
think
there
is
a
portion
missing
of
a
sentence
in
the
printing
there.
it
should
have
read
products
bearing
dual
weights
would
not
be
allowed.
mr.
william
j.
condon
product
bearing
dual
weights,
which
new
york
demands.
mr.
william
j.
condon
did
that
help?
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
what
happened,
the
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
right,
that's
what
he
testified,
if
you
put
this
on,
we
won't
let
it
out
of
your
plant.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
judge
friendly
was
concerned
about
the
fact
that
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
yes,
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
the
act
provides
this
that
you
must
--
the
act,
the
regulations
say
you
must
get
approval
from
the
secretary.
then
it
says
if
you
don't
accept,
if
you
do
not
accept
the
determination
of
the
secretary,
then
you
may
have
a
hearing,
administrative
hearing,
and
then
if
you
are
aggrieved
or
adversely
affected
after
that
you
may
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
meanwhile
you
are
out
of
business
mr.
william
j.
condon
that
was
his
position,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
i
can
only
--
i
refer
to
that
testimony
and
then
i
refer
further
to
page
36,
i
believe
in
the
record
and
is
one
of
these
exhibits
to
the
complaint.
it
was
an
amendment
to
the
regulation,
which
was
in
the
federal
register
on
january
16,
1963,
this
was
prior
to
the
beginning
of
this
lawsuit,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
second
column
there
is
explanatory
material
with
respect
to
the
amendment
and
in
that
explanatory
material,
the
deputy
administrator,
this
bureau,
the
marketing
services
points
out
that
this
amendment
clarifies
the
original
intent
of
the
regulation,
but
i
think
it
more
recently
understood
that
the
net
weight
required
to
appear
on
the
immediate
container
of
any
poultry
product
is
the
net
weight
of
the
poultry
product
and
includes
in
addition
to
the
weight
of
the
poultry,
the
weight
of
any
ingredient
that
is
combined
with
the
poultry
and
the
product
and
excludes
the
weights
when
are
dry
packaging
materials
and
so
on.
mr.
william
j.
condon
yes.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no,
it
does
not,
but
it
does
rather
say
affirmatively
that
when
we
say
net
weight
in
our
regulation,
we
mean
the
net
weight
of
the
poultry
product
and
not
exclusive
of
these
other
ingredients.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no,
not
specifically
in
so
many
words.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
right,
that's
right.
our
position
on
this
of
course
is
that
congress
has
been
rather
careful
in
the
choice
of
words
in
this
thing.
now,
the
solicitor
general
says
the
record
isn't
right
because
we
had
an
administrative
procedure,
we
had
remedies,
but
first
of
all
remedies
suggest
that
you've
been
wrong.
i'm
not
challenging
what
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
done.
we
have
no
challenge
to
that.
now
i
am
not
--
first
of
all,
i
personally
haven't
been
able
to
find
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
we
must
exhaust
our
administrative
remedies
in
order
to
rely
upon
an
administrative
determination.
now,
surely
while
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
this
subordinate
federal
official
hasn't
really
undone
anything,
this
same
subordinate
federal
official
has
approved
every
label
that's
moving
in
interstate
commerce
and
poultry
products
today.
the
law
says
if
you
don't
get
approval
from
the
secretary,
you
can't
ship
and
your
product
is
illegal.
surely,
we
don't
understand
the
solicitor
general
to
say
that
isn't
an
approval
label.
there
must
be.
so
that
what
this
man
has
done,
the
delegate
of
the
secretary
must
have
some
legal
significance.
now
we
have
in
the
odd
words
that
congress
used,
we
have
accepted
the
determination
of
the
secretary.
our
argument
of
course
we
laid
it
out
in
the
brief
was
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
the
secretary
himself
wasn't
going
to
approve
these
labels
in
the
first
instance
and
yet
it
provides
for
a
hearing,
an
appeal
from
the
secretary's
determination.
so
that
this
was
the
determination
of
the
secretary.
the
rejection
of
our
label
was
the
determination
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
make
that
argument
with
respect
to
the
preemption.
mr.
william
j.
condon
but
these
of
course
have
to
be
alternative
arguments.
i
don't
pretend
that
there
is
a
must
response
to
this
court,
by
this
court
to
a
preemption
argument.
these
are
very
difficult
questions.
but
i
say
if
you
do
find
that
there
is
not
a
preemption
then
there
is
this
conflict.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
another
problem,
that's
commerce.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
that's
very
true,
but
mr.
justice
brennan.
he
said
there
is
a
conflict
because
he
did
say
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
that's
true.
again
though
in
candor
i
must
say
he
is
another
subordinate
federal
official.
he
may
not
be
quite
as
subordinate
as
the
head
of
the
poultry
product
section,
but
he
is
only
a
step
further
up.
the
deputy
administrator
has
indicated
that
this
is
the
way
they
interpret
it
and
our
experience
has
indicated,
and
based
upon
our
experience
we
didn't
see
any
point
in
going
up
the
administrative
ladder
to
get
further
indications
that
we
were
going
to
get
any
same
result
that
we
got
here.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no
your
honor.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess
we
were
talking
very
briefly
about
the
problem
of
getting
a
product
out
of
the
plant,
if
it
didn't
bare
a
label
which
was
approved
by
the
department.
a
word
in
that
regard
might
be
an
order.
i'm
sure
the
is
court
is
aware
of
the
way
the
poultry
products
inspection
act
is
enforced
or
applied
by
the
department
of
agriculture.
substantially
the
same
system
has
been
in
effect
under
the
meat
inspection
act
for
the
last
--
close
to
60
years
even
though
this
statute
is
relatively
new.
there
are
full
time
inspectors
on
the
plant
at
all
times.
no
product
can
move
out
unless
it
is
approved
by
the
inspectors
and
no
product
in
package
form
may
leave
the
plant
unless
it
bears
an
approved
label
and
it
was
on
this
basis
i
think
that
mr.
howell
was
able
to
say
in
response
to
the
question
of
the
trial,
we
wouldn't
let
the
product
out
of
the
plant.
mr.
william
j.
condon
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
sorry
to
say
i
have
no
information
on
which
i
base
an
answer
to
that.
my
information
not
only
from
the
swift
&
company,
but
from
the
department
of
agriculture
is
there
has
never
been
such
a
hearing.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
we've
been
involved
in
hearing
from
the
department
of
agriculture
to
be
sure.
mr.
william
j.
condon
this
i
don't
have
any
information
with
which
i
can
answer
your
question.
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
j.
condon
for
number
of
reasons
mr.
justice
white,
first
of
all,
by
reason
of
the
regulation
in
the
explanatory
material
which
i
read
prior
to
the
recess,
we
didn't
expect
the
label
to
be
approved.
quite
frankly
we
expected
that
this
interpretation
which
was
written
in
that
federal
register
release
would
govern,
but
my
client,
the
company
didn't
want
to
start
an
action
until
it
had
at
least
made
this
effort.
having
made
the
effort
and
having
got
the
response
they
expected
to
get,
not
they
applied
for,
but
they
expected
to
get
this
response,
then
it
was
felt
it
would
be
useless
to
go
further
because
the
response
that
we
got
from
the
secretary's
delegate
was
precise
to
the
same
as
what
was
forecast
by
this
regulatory
release.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
a
legal
advice
was
sought
by
the
client
and
the
legal
advice
was
no
we
don't
think
there
will
be
any
difference,
we
don't
anticipate
there
will
be
any
difference.
mr.
william
j.
condon
oh,
no
sir
it's
clear
under
the
statute
we
did
have
a
right.
mr.
william
j.
condon
to
go
to
hearing
at
the
secretary's
level,
the
statute
says
that
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
yes
sir,
that
was
the
fact
and
i
think
i
should
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
i
don't
know,
as
i
need
an
excuse,
that
--
probably
the
problem
is
a
matter
of
emphasis.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
think
new
york
would
have
said
precisely
that.
mr.
william
j.
condon
1963,
the
fall
of
1963.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no,
did
they?
i'm
sorry,
the
question,
did
they?
no
there
really
wasn't
any
proceeding
mr.
justice
clark.
we
merely
filed
an
application
for
label
approval.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
after
reading
judge
friendly's
opinion,
i
would
now
anticipate
that
they
might.
at
that
time
if
you
asked
me
the
same
question
my
answer
would
be
no,
this
is
a
matter
between
company
subject
to
regulation
and
the
regulatory
agency,
i
would
not
expect
that
the
state
of
new
york
was
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
i
would
say
this
in
all
candor
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
answer
that
the
client
got
was
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
client.
the
overriding
clamor
in
the
food
industry
today
is
for
uniformity
of
labeling.
this
is
the
one
thing
that
our
people
talk
about,
complain
about
more
than
any
thing
else.
mr.
william
j.
condon
the
only
purpose
of
it
would
have
been
to
--
perhaps
like
a
better
record
and
this
didn't
seem
to
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
condon
it
is
proper,
but
it
isn't
true.
it
would
have
been
a
proper
thing
to
do
i
think,
but
it
isn't
true
because
at
the
time,
at
the
time
we
made
this
application
there
still
was
ample
time
to
take
advantage
of
the
holiday
season,
it's
a
holiday
product
at
its
principle
distribution,
big
thrust
and
there
would
still
be
time
to
stuff
a
lot
of
turkeys
for
new
york
and
get
them
into
the
new
york
market
and
the
commercial
people
raised
a
clamor
for
us
to
take
just
one
more
step
before
we
did
anything
further.
having
done
that
then
other
people
said
no,
that's
enough,
we've
gone
far
enough
now.
if
we
are
going
to
determine
this
thing
we
might
justice
as
well
figure
that
we're
out
of
the
new
york
market
until
the
matter
has
been
clarified
judicially.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no
sir,
we're
not
complacent
because
while
a
statement,
a
simple
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case
will
indicate
that
we're
litigating
about
the
label
on
a
stuffed
turkey.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we're
litigating
about
the
labels
on
all
kinds
of
combination
products
which
contain
meat
or
poultry,
both
of
which
we
deal
in,
both
appellants
deal
in,
and
other
food
ingredients,
and
we
make
hundreds
of
such
products.
now
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about,
the
new
york
statute
applies
by
its
terms
not
only
to
stuffed
turkey,
it
applies
to
any
combination
product
which
is
other
than
a
ready-
to-eat
meal,
which
contains
meat,
poultry
or
sea
food
and
other
edible
ingredients.
now
this
is
pork
and
beans,
corn
beef
hash,
frozen
dinners,
all
of
these
things,
they
are
all
covered
by
this,
and
we
make
all
of
these
things.
and
if
these
labeling
requirements
are
going
to
be
extended
to
all
of
these
products,
john
madden,
the
director
of
weights
and
measures
of
state
of
new
york
in
his
testimony,
he
said,
no,
we
don't
apply
this
law
to
meat
products,
and
we
don't
apply
it
to
sea
food
products,
and
we
don't
apply
to
other
poultry
products,
we
don't
apply
it
to
soups,
we
don't
apply
it
to
turkey
dinners,
tv
dinners,
and
things
of
that
sort,
because
in
his
idea
was
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
and
enforce
it,
they
couldn't
check
the
weights
on
these
things.
but
he
said,
we
are
anxious
to
see
how
this
case
comes
out
because
we'll
have
to
be
guided
by
the
law
as
it's
told
to
us.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
william
j.
condon
the
label?
mr.
william
j.
condon
and
what
does
it
required
under
the
new
york
law?
mr.
william
j.
condon
the
new
york
law
requires
that
a
stuffed
turkey
in
this
case,
show
the
net
weight
of
the
turkey
and
the
net
weight
of
the
total
product.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
the
reason
has
--
it
has
been
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
the
reason
as
it
has
been
expressed
is
that
the
consumer
has
a
right
to
know
how
much
turkey
he
is
getting.
mr.
william
j.
condon
surely,
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
the
consumer
might
be
better
informed
if
we
gave
more
information.
the
same
however
would
be
true
if
we
told
how
much
mash
potato
there
was
in
the
tv
dinner
or
how
much
peas.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
think
though
that
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
this
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
don't
think
--
actually,
i
don't
think
this
is
so
from
what
our
people
say
and
what
mr.
howell
testified
that
you
see
a
turkey
doesn't
stretch,
we
don't
take
the
ribcage
out
of
these
things,
all
we
do
is
fill
what's
there.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no,
generally
speaking
it
won't
look
any
bigger.
the
ends
of
him
will
be
rounded
out,
it
will
make
a
prettier
package
perhaps
because
the
ends
are
kind
of
rounded
out,
but
other
than
that
the
body
of
the
turkey
doesn't
stretch
or
expand,
it
stays
the
same.
mr.
william
j.
condon
quite
true,
it's
possible
as
it
was
indicated
in
this
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
hat's
absolutely,
that's
absolutely
right.
of
course
people
say
we
stand
and
run
for
office
every
single
day
with
that
electric
and
we
are
not
interested
and
no
manufacturer
who
is
in
the
business
is
interested
in
selling
one
turkey
to
somebody.
we
want
to
sell
that
person
over
and
over
again.
these
things
are
to
an
extent
self
regulating.
now
we
are
not
talking,
clear
we
are
not
talking
here
about
any
fraud,
we
are
not
talking
about
any
misrepresentations.
we
are
talking
about
two
different
ideas
from
two
different
regulatory
agencies
as
to
which
information
best
serves
the
consumer's
interest
and
both
of
these
agencies
are
interested
in
the
consumer's
interest.
now
as
far
as
the
appellants
are
concerned,
if
the
department
of
agriculture
would
take
the
view
that
all
stuffed
turkeys
ought
to
show
both
the
weight
of
the
turkey
and
the
weight
of
the
product,
we
would
have
no
problem
with
this,
because
then
again
we
would
be
back
to
uniformity.
we
could
use
the
same
label
wherever
we
were
going
to
ship
that
turkey
and
we
wouldn't
have
to
police
the
shipment
of
it.
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
whether
a
turkey
with
one
label
was
going
into
a
place
where
that
label
was
not
acceptable.
these
are
the
things
which
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
i
think
you
can
do
it
one
of
two
different
ways.
you
can
either
hold
that
you
don't
have
to
appeal
from
an
administrative
--
a
proper
administrative
determination
that
you
are
not
aggrieved
by
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
condon
the
other
one
would
be
to
read
that
as
being
the
action
of
the
secretary,
which
is
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
we
must
have
a
label
approved
by
the
secretary.
it
further
says,
that
if
you
don't
accept
the
secretary's
determination,
the
only
determination
we
have
is
one,
so
that
if
you
don't
accept
the
secretary's
determination,
then
you
may
have
an
administrative
appeal.
now
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
secretary
to
the
secretary.
it
is
however
the
action
of
the
secretary.
however
much
people
may
refer
to
a
subordinate
federal
official
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
it's
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
can
get
them
into
commerce,
but
not
into
new
york.
mr.
william
j.
condon
in
a
sense,
in
a
sense
that's
true.
mr.
william
j.
condon
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
condon
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
condon
no
sir,
our
position
or
our
contention
is
confined
to
the
situation
where
as
here
and
in
the
meat
inspection
act,
we
are
dealing
with
labels,
the
text
form
and
content
of
which
must
have
the
prior
approval
of
the
regulatory
agency
before
we
can
use
them.
now,
in
the
case
of
oleomargarine
and
other
food
products
which
are
regulated
by
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
of
the
food
and
drug
administration,
under
that
act,
there
is
no
prior
approval,
requirements
of
those
statutes
are
set
out
and
as
long
as
you
meet
them,
that's
all
that
matters.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
think
that
the
burden
of
my
argument
mr.
justice
fortas
is
this,
that
where
congress
has
spoken
with
specificity
about
labeling
requirements
and
then
has
charged
the
agency
with
the
prior
approval
of
labels
in
connection
with
that
specificity
of
requirement,
that
the
additional
requisite
of
prior
approval
indicates
to
a
far
greater
degree
the
intent
of
congress
that,
that
control
of
labels
shall
be
exclusive
of
all
other
control.
in
other
words,
it's
another
facet
to
give
weight
to
the
claim
of
federal
preemption.
mr.
william
j.
condon
in
the
case
of,
excuse
me,
in
the
case
of
products
under
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
for
example,
there
is
no
easy
answer
that
would
cover
all
products.
in
some
cases,
you
will
have
preemption,
in
other
case
you
will
not.
i
anticipate
these,
i'm
not
citing
specifics
at
the
moment.
mr.
william
j.
condon
yes,
there
are
sir.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
the
proper
person
to
ask
that.
mr.
william
j.
condon
you've
asked
it
and
my
answer
is
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
solicitor
general's
brief
reflects
the
views
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
think
it
would
weigh
heavily,
it
surely
would.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
would
certainly
think
you
are.
mr.
william
j.
condon
nothing
as
specific
as
i'd
like
to
have
it
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
references,
not
great
references
to
labeling.
the
legislative
history
was
largely
concerned
with
the
problems
of
wholesomeness
and
the
--
i
think
the
--
there
were
one
or
two
references
in
our
brief
but
the
references
that
are
in
the
institute
of
poultry
industries,
amicus
brief
are
as
good
as
you
can
get.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i'm
suggesting
merely
that
the
references
in
the
amicus
brief
are
probably
the
--
as
wholesomeness
as
you
can
find
on
the
question
of
labeling
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
and
if
we
all
agree
that,
that
isn't
dispositive
of
the
issue
it
would
be
helpful,
i
would
be
delighted
if
there
were
a
lot
more.
but
this
is
not
the
problem
that
was
accorded
a
great
deal
of
attention
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i'm
inferring
from
that,
plus
the
other
things
which
i
mentioned
yesterday.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
think
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
the
court
is
entitled
to
know
that.
mr.
william
j.
condon
what
do
i
think
it
is?
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
one.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
don't
believe
that
they
are
and
that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
that
the
views
expressed
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
only
--
mr.
william
j.
condon
basically,
i
think
officially
it
has
to
be
secretary.
mr.
william
j.
condon
oh
not
in
this,
no
sir.
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
presented
to
you
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well
i
was
careful
not
to
say
that
until
somebody
asked
me
if
i
thought
this
represent
of
the
view
and
i
don't.
mr.
william
j.
condon
there
have
been
cases
and
reports
of
course
indicating
representatives
of
both.
mr.
william
j.
condon
united
states
versus
united
states.[attempt

laughter]
mr.
william
j.
condon
conversations
that
i've
had
with.
mr.
william
j.
condon
general
counsel,
representatives
general
counsel's
office
and
an
assistant
secretary.
mr.
william
j.
condon
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
were
one
or
two
things
that
were
opened
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
argument
that
may
require
at
least
mention.
one,
the
matter
of
the
knowledge
of
the
department
of
agriculture
of
the
situation
with
respect
to
new
york,
as
the
attorney
general
pointed
out.
mr.
howell
who
is
deputy
director
of
the
poultry
division
testified
on
the
subpoena
by
swift
&
company
in
the
criminal
prosecution
in
new
york
city
in
november
of
1962.
he
testified
again
at
the
trail
of
this
action
in
1964.
now
i'm
sure
that
we
all
know
that
no
federal
official
in
the
department
of
this
kind
is
going
to
come
to
new
york
in
response
to
a
subpoena
without
the
knowledge,
official
knowledge
of
his
department,
that
the
subpoena
isn't
served
and
worked
quite
the
same
way
on
a
federal
official
as
it
might
someone
else
on
the
street.
the
department
did
know
and
did
know
the
problem
and
the
approval
was
given
to
mr.
howell
to
respond
and
testify
on
their
behalf.
somehow
or
other
it
appears
that
because
the
department
didn't
get
in
touch
with
new
york,
that
the
department
and
particularly
mr.
howell
was
being
partial,
perhaps
partial
in
the
swift
&
company
or
armour
and
company,
i'm
not
sure
which,
but
i
think
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
mentioned
that
new
york
also
was
aware
of
the
conflict
and
perhaps
new
york
might
have
had
some
burden.
there
are
after
all
49
other
states
and
perhaps
new
york
might
have
had
some
question
or
some
burden
or
responsibility
of
being
in
touch
with
the
federal
people.
there
is
no
indication
that
this
was
done
either.
now,
the
point
was
made
again
finally
that
these
other
combination
products
to
which
the
poultry
institute
brief
refers
are
not
covered
by
the
new
york
law
and
this
simply
isn't
true.
as
long
as
they
are
not
ready
to
eat,
and
that
means
cooked,
handed
to
you
so
that
you
can
eat
them
now,
if
they
are
combinations
of
meat,
poultry
or
sea
food,
they
are
covered
by
the
statute.
this
confusion
existed
on
the
record
and
it
was
clarified
in
the
cross
examination
and
again
the
redirect
examination
of
mr.
madden
at
his
testimony
in
the
trial
he
was
the
defendant's
principal
witness
here.
one
other
point:
there
was
reference
made
to
the
material
that
appears
on
the
bottom
of
the
application
form.
this
material
was
read
and
it
says
that
this
represents
the
attitude
of
this
service
only
and
does
not
excuse
the
compliance.
now
the
question
is,
i
suppose
what
does
that
mean?
the
only
answer
to
that,
i
don't
know
what
it
means
but
in
view
of
what's
happened
in
this
lawsuit,
we
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
it
does
not
mean.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
service
having
rejected
your
application
is
going
to
close
its
eyes
if
you
try
to
put
out
a
product
with
a
label
that
doesn't
comply
with
what
they've
done.
now,
it
might
very
well
mean
that
the
product
can't
be
sold
if
it's
adulterated
and
it
might
very
well
mean
a
number
of
other
things,
but
it
cannot
mean
that
the
service
is
turning
its
back
on
the
mandate
of
congress
and
not
going
to
do
what
congress
has
told
them
to
do
and
that
this
doesn't
mean
what
the
congressional
act
obviously
seems
to
say
that
it
does.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
they
both
require
a
statement
of
net
weight,
i
think
the
substantial
difference
is,
the
federal
act
calls
for
the
net
weight
of
the
product,
poultry
product.
it
defines
poultry
product
to
be,
poultry
plus
anything
else
is
packed
with
it,
food.
the
new
york
law
requires
net
weight,
but
it
defines
net
weight
as
being
the
net
weight
of
the
meat,
poultry
or
sea
food.
mr.
william
j.
condon
well,
i
think
that's
at
least
a
permissible
interpretation.
this
is
one
of
the
claims
that
was
made
in
the
letter
that
dr.
lee
wrote
in
commenting
upon
our
application
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
william
j.
condon
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
condon
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
condon
as
applied
certainly
to
that
product,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
understood,
mr.
justice
fortas
to
be
asking
upon
that
basis,
the
prior
approval.
mr.
william
j.
condon
it
did
not,
i'm
sorry
sir,
without
that,
and
again
now
you
are
back
to
essentially
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
situation.
then
i
would
say
no,
there
is
no
necessary
preemption
and
there
is
no
necessary
conflict.
no
sir.
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
in
a
given
situation,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
or
not.
mr.
william
j.
condon
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
condon
i
do
not,
as
far
as
i
know,
they
did
not,
but
i
can't
say
that
they
for
sure.
thank
you.
