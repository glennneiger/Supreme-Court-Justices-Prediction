chief

how
many
states
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
just
put
the
difference
for
that?
chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
board
explore
all
those
matters
thoroughly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
on
this
particular
issue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
you
have
to
give
more
weight
than
that
to
the
argument
of
counsel
on
the
legislative
history?
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
supreme
definite
history
there
that
would
call
for
a
very
serious
discussion
by
you?
for
instance,
the
secretary
wirtz
who
represented
the
administration
that
proposed
the
bill
is
alleged
to
that
but
told
to
the
house
committee
that
state
full-crew
laws
would
be
unaffected
and
the
house
committee
reported
that
the
award
would
not
supersede
state
crew
laws.
i'm
just
saying
what
is
alleged
here.
and
the
chairman
of
the
icc
told
the
senate
committee
that
the
legislation
would
not
affect
state
laws
and
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee
told
his
chamber
that
state
laws
would
not
be
infringed
and
the
general
counsel
of
icc
did
very
much
the
same
thing
and
its
also
alleged
that
the
carriers
themselves
recognized
and
stated
at
that
time
that
it
did
not
affect
these
laws.
now,
that's
pretty
persuasive,
legislative
history
and
i
would
think
you
treat
it
little
more
seriously
than
you
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
report
of
the
house
committee
itself
it
said
that
these
laws
would
not
be
affected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
--
how
about
the
statement
of
the
chairman
of
the
icc?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wouldn't
that
(voice
overlap)
just
as
easy
for
congress
to
say
that
they
were
superseding
state
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
saying
that
it's
easiest
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
to
do
it
the
other
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
attitude
of
the
carriers
themselves
of
the
--
of
this
hearing,
what
was
their
position?
did
they
take
the
position
that
this
was
supersession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
didn't
very
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did
urge
that
this
was
a
supersession,
well,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
--
i
hope
on
--
was
there
anything
in
the
senate
report
that
stated
that
this
was
supersession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lyons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lyons,
is
it
a
fact
that
the
chairman
of
the
icc
told
the
senate
committee
that
the
legislation
would
not
affect
state
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
rather
important.
your
quoting
counsel
as
saying
what
they
might
do
to
make
it
clear
that
if
the
chairman
of
icc
commission
said
that
possibly
that
this
law
does
not
affect
state
laws,
i
would
think
it
would
be
quite
relevant
to
legislative
history.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
debate
of
that
kind
on
the
floor?
did
anybody
raise
those
precise
questions
that
you're
talking
about
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
you
think
that
if
all
these
people
spoke
in
terms
of
--
had
not
been
supersession,
the
representative
of
the
president
to
--
the
secretary
of
labor,
the
chairman
of
the
icc
committee,
the
house
committee
on
the
subject
and
even
the
railroads
themselves
passively
agreeing
that
it
was
(inaudible)
no
supersession,
don't
you
think
that
some
opponents
would
be
likely
to
raise
that
question
on
the
floor
in
one
house
or
the
other
and
say
that
it
would
accomplish
that
purpose
as
you
are
here.
certainly
this
would
have
been
known
to
the
carriers
and
i
would
think
that
in
view
of
all
these
statements,
they
would
--
would've
try
to
make
sure
that
this
didn't
happened.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
--
the
only
reason
i
asked
you
is
because
either
you
or
your
--
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
light
said
that
this
was
a
matter
that
had
been
under
discussion
and
argument,
and
debate
for
11
years
and
that
it
was
prominent
in
the
minds
of
everybody
at
the
time
the
importance
of
it
and
i
merely
asked
the
question
because
if
it
had
that
importance
and
had
been
clearly
canvassed
to
that
extent,
wouldn't
it
seem
reasonable
that
someone
would've
raised
that
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
those
economic
factors
should
prevail
over
safety?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lyons,
assuming
that
there
is
supersession
here,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
congress
intended
to
supersede
the
state
laws
and
limited
their
supersession
to
two
years
that
none
--
notwithstanding
that
limitation
of
two
years
that
these
laws
would
be
permanently
superseded?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
all
time
to
come?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
youngdahl.
