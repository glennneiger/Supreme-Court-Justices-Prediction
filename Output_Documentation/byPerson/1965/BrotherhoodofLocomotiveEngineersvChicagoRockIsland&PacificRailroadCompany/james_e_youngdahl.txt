mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
argument,
i
hope
to
demonstrate
that
the
essence
of
a
supremacy
clause
preemption
inquiry
is
find
out
what
congress
intended
at
the
most
authoritative
indication
of
what
congress
intended
as
to
public
law
88-108
as
found
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
act.
that
the
reading
of
a
legislative
history
leaves
no
doubt
that
congress
intended
with
thought
on
the
matter
not
that
preempt
and
that
in
the
face
of
this
intent,
clearly
demonstrated
the
railroads
are
asking
this
court
to
make
a
policy
decision
overseeing
of
legislative
branch
which
this
court
have
rejected
in
other
contexts.
as
does
mr.
lessenberry,
the
brotherhoods
concede
that,
of
course,
congress
has
the
power
to
preempt,
however,
the
state
full-crew
laws
may
be
characterized.
we
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
say
that
a
preemption
inquiry
as
to
determine
what
was
the
measurement
of
the
occupation
of
the
field,
what
was
the
measurement
of
congress'
action?
and
the
mechanics
of
that
inquiry
as
we
understand
it,
in
determining
the
intent
of
congress,
are
first
to
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
the
full-crew
laws
are
not
referred
to
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
both
sides
have
been
able
to
cite
cases
saying
that
since
there
has
no
reference,
therefore,
it's
preempted,
or
therefore,
it's
not
preempted
and
indeed
there
are
cases
on
both
sides
by
this
court
depending
upon
the
context.
there
are
two
contextual
factors
here
which
we
urge
upon
the
court
as
being
a
vital
significance
in
showing
that
a
failure
to
mention
state
full-crew
laws
indicates
an
intent
not
to
preempt.
the
first
of
these
is
the
history
of
consideration
of
full-crew
laws
by
this
court
which
mr.
lessenberry
described
to
you.
they've
been
up
here
repeatedly
and
repeatedly
this
court
has
denied
preemption
and
other
arguments.
i
do
not
bring
this
up
in
the
sense
of
suggesting
that
the
court
is
bound
by
the
past
decisions,
but
i
do
bring
it
up
in
the
sense
of
suggesting
that
congress
relied
on
them
and
particularly
in
norwood
case
in
1931
where
the
key
statement
on
preemption
by
this
court
was,
that
unless
congress
and
until
congress
expressly
so
says
so,
full-crew
laws
remain
in
effect.
that
statement
was
presented
to
the
house
of
committee
on
commerce,
the
senate
committee
on
congress,
it
was
presented
on
the
floor
of
congress,
it
was
presented
in
memorandums,
submitted
to
congress
during
the
processing
or
public
law
88-108.
it
was
the
statement
which
was
repeatedly
brought
to
attention
of
congress
and
obviously
the
statement
on
which
congress
relied.
and
the
second
contextual
factor
which
as
a
matter
fact,
occurred
to
me
since
my
briefs
in
this
case,
is
that
the
last
major
piece
of
railway
labor
legislation
that
was
passed
by
the
united
states
congress
was
in
1951.
when
the
railway
labor
act
itself
was
amended
in
order
to
allow
union
shop,
the
union
security
devices,
and
obviously,
there
a
possible
question
of
preemption
is
presented.
as
this
course
can
--
court,
considered
the
matter
in
the
hanson
case
which
is
cited
by
the
appellees
frequently,
the
key
point
as
a
context
to
not
mentioning
preemption
in
public
law
88-108.
the
key
point
is
that
the
1951
amendment
start
out
by
saying,
“notwithstanding
the
laws
of
any
state,
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroads
may
negotiate
a
union
security
provision”.
this
was
the
last
piece
of
legislation
prior
to
public
law
188
in
the
general
field
of
labor-management
relations
in
the
railroad
industry.
and
again,
a
strong
indication
it
seems
to
us,
that
congress
by
not
mentioning
full-crew
laws
intended
not
to
preempt.
but
more
than
that,
the
legislative
history
which
i
hope
to
be
able
to
deal
with
in
detail
in
a
few
minutes
was
definitive
and
comprehensive.
i
cannot
candidly
conceive
of
a
person
reading
that
legislative
history
which
to
be
sure
is
extensive
and
coming
out
with
the
idea
that
any
member
of
congress
who
consider
the
question
and
many
did,
many
did
expressly
could've
conceive
of
the
fact
that
congress
was
preempting
full-crew
laws
and
as
enactment
of
that
statute.
revolving
as
it
was
to
say,
the
history
does
around
the
norwood
case
in
particular.
the
railroads
urged
upon
this
court
what
the
court
has
called
subsidiary
test
of
supersession.
when
congress
has
not
expressed
itself
either
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
it
has
been
said,
“we
then
examine
how
the
two
kinds
of
enactment
work
as
between
themselves
are
they
--
do
they
clash?
is
there
a
physical
impossibility
of
complaints
with
both?
is
the
federal
legislation
so
pervasive
as
to
make
the
implication
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preempt?”
i
don't
think
we
need
to
get
to
those
things
in
this
case.
but
in
the
event
that
we
do,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
subsidiary
test
of
supersession
bare
out
the
primary
test
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
safety,
certainly,
mr.
justice
white,
was
the
original
purpose.
safety,
still
is
a
consideration
on
which
the
statutes
are
valid.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
certainly,
they
have
safety
considerations
in
mind
and
they
made
evaluation
based
upon
their
judgment
about
safety.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
in
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
our
first
response
as
i
indicated
whether
the
congress
said
that
they
meant
to
exempt
state
full-crew
laws.
secondly,
section
3
of
public
law
88-108,
refers
to
two
particular
issues
and
assigns
to
the
arbitration
board
jurisdiction
over
this
--
those
issues.
those
issues
are
well-defined,
first
of
all,
by
the
notices
of
the
party
which
started
this
whole
dispute
back
in
1959
and
1960.
those
in
order
said,
do
not
refer
to
state
full-crew
laws
and
in
fact
the
railroads
testified
during
the
consideration
of
88-108
that
they
could
not
negotiate
away
and
had
no
idea
of
being
able
to
negotiate
away
the
state
full-crew
laws.
they
are
just
stuck
with
them
until
they
can
go
to
the
legislature.
that's
what
they
said
up
to
the
briefs
in
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
statute
in
turn
says
that
the
arbitrators
are
to
be
bound
by
what
the
parties
have
agreed
on,
to
consider
what
the
parties
tentatively
have
agreed
on.
and
in
another
words,
to
bring
together
the
parties
in
that
last
little
keystone
that
evaded
the
meeting
of
the
arch
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
congress
was
asked
the
arbitration
board
to
act
for
the
parties
since
the
parties
were
apparently
not
able
to
act
for
themselves.
and
it
was
only
within
the
scope
of
what
the
parties
might
have
done
that
the
arbitration
board
acted
and
the
arbitration
board
itself
conceded
this
and
said
there
are
many
questions
of
law
or
policy
involving
state
statutes
and
other
thing
we
cannot
reach.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
what
the
stats
--
that
is
what
the
railroad
themselves
say
in
the
legislative
history
and
that's
what
congress
intended,
judging
from
that
history
in
my
view.
let
me
proceed
--
oh
one
more
on
subsidiary
test
of
supersession.
the
railroads
repeatedly
say
that
the
standards
of
the
full-crew
laws
and
the
standards
of
public
--
of
the
arbitration
award
are
not
the
same,
that
is,
there
are
more
crew
members
required
by
one
and
by
the
other
or
allowed
by
one
and
allow
the
other.
after
dissenting
judge
below
pointed
out
and
as
several
state
courts
have
pointed
out
since
then,
the
two
kinds
of
enactment
present
minimums.
there
is
not
a
physical
impossibility
of
complaints
with
both,
and
in
fact,
during
the
past
year
for
example
that
railroads
have
complied
with
both.
it
would
be
entirely
different
of
course
if
congress
provided
for
a
maximum
crew
which
was
less
than
the
minimum
crew
provided
for
by
the
state
full-crew
laws.
physically,
that
in
terms
of
exact
number,
it's
going
to
be
impossible
to
comply
with
both.
there
has
been
compliance
with
both
and
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
florida
lime
case.
the
fact
that
the
tests
are
different
does
not
dispose
of
the
problem.
in
fact,
it
poses
the
problem.
now
again,
these
subsidiary
tests,
we
believe,
are
not
even
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
because
the
intent
of
congress
is
so
clear
and
it's
not
necessary
to
examine
what
it
must
have
meant
if
it
had
thought
about
the
problem
or
if
it
were
reasonable
in
dealing
with
the
problem.
now,
as
to
the
specific
legislative
history,
public
law
88-108
was
presented
by
president
kennedy
and
he
said
to
the
congress,
“we
are
giving
you
the
entire
issue
--
the
entire
series
of
issues
that
separate
the
parties,
there
are
eight
or
ten
separate
issues.
and
we
are
asking
that
all
of
these
issues
be
assigned
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
acting
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.”
congress
rejected
some
of
that
procedure
and
some
important
parts
of
it.
it
said,
“we
don't
want
the
interstate
commerce
act
involved.”
at
the
behest
of
the
railway-brotherhood
incidentally,
they
expressly
say,
“we're
signing
this
to
an
ad
hoc
independent
arbitration
board.
and
secondly,
we
don't
want
to
go
into
anymore
than
we
absolutely
have
to
and
apparently
we
only
absolutely
have
to
go
into
two
of
those
eight
or
ten
issues.”
so
congress
then
assigned
to
the
ad
hoc
arbitration
board,
two
issues
which
seem
to
be
the
issues
which
held
the
arts
of
collective
bargaining
apart,
those
last
things
which
the
party
have
somehow
been
unable
to
do
for
themselves
up
to
that
point.
now,
the
administrative
intention
in
this
respect,
the
intention
of
the
administration
where
the
--
on
preemption
of
state
full-crew
laws
specifically
was
expressed
by
secretary
of
labor
wirtz,
who
presented
the
administration
proposal,
explained
and
interpreted
it
in
both
houses.
his
first
statement
was
in
the
house
representative
before
the
house
commerce
committee.
and
there
he
said,
“the
intention
of
the
administration
is
not
to
preempt
full-crew
laws,”
citing
again
that
norwood
opinion.
and
the
norwood
statement,
that
unless
congress
says
to
the
contrary
that
state
full-crew
law
shall
be
presumed
to
be
valid.
the
house
representatives,
members
of
the
house
and
committees
repeatedly
over
and
over
again
said,
“one
thing
we
don't
want
to
do,
we
don't
want
to
preempt
full-crew
laws.”
i
respectfully
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
appendix
c
in
my
brief
in
which
i
quote
verbatim
the
expressed
specific
references
to
full-crew
laws
in
the
congressional
record.
i
submit,
however,
that
there
are
many,
many
kinds
of
general
expresses
of
intent
such
as
the
desire
not
to
go
into
great
detail,
not
to
have
anymore
impact
on
the
situation
and
absolutely
necessary
which
also
review
in
attempt
--
intent
not
to
preempt.
when
the
house
report
came
out
in
the
house
floor,
chairman
oren
harris
of
the
house
interstate
commerce
committee,
was
asked
specifically,
“what
about
the
effect
of
this
law
in
public
law
88-108?”
and
he
said
again,
he
quoted
the
norwood
decision
of
this
court
on
preemption.
he
said
that
--
he
pointed
to
the
report
and
the
report
of
the
house
committee
said,
and
this
was
reached
in
a
session
in
which
31
out
of
33
of
the
committee
members
were
there,
they
voted
unanimously
and
the
report
says
expressly,
“it
is
not
the
intent
of
this
committee
to
preempt
state
full-crew
laws
or
to
affect
to
have
any
effect
on
--”
i
think
they
described
the
“demanding
laws
of
the
various
states.”
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
the
quotation
is
both
in
the
body
of
my
brief
and
the
appendix
of
that
page
14
of
the
house
report
on
what
eventually
became
public
law
88-108.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
expressly
said
in
so
many
words,
there
are
the
sentence
on
it
which
is
the
last
sentence
in
the
explanation
of
section
3
of
the
bill
that
were
referred
to
the
house
floor.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
offhand.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
in
the
report.
in
my
appendix,
i
have
house
committee
and
then
house
floor
and
at
the
end
of
the
discussion
of
what
the
house
committee
--
of
the
proceedings
in
the
house
committee
is
the
house
report
and
i
remember
it's
at
page
14
of
the
house
report.
it's
also
cited
in
the
body
of
the
argument
of
my
brief
and
quoted.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
house
report.
now,
what
the
house
reported
--
well,
to
continue
about
representative
harris,
representative
harris
point
to
norwood,
he
pointed
to
what
the
committee
report
had
said.
he
said
it's
not
the
intention
to
preempt.
he
said,
“i
think
that's
about
as
clear
as
we
can
make
it.”
now,
what
the
house
reported
to
the
floor
was
a
change
in
respect
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
taking
out
the
ad
hoc
--
taking
out
the
ad
hoc
nature
of
the
--
substituting
an
ad
hoc
nature
of
the
arbitration
board
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decision
on
page
65
of
the
appendix
--
page
65
of
my
brief
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
--
at
14
of
the
report.
the
house
then
on
the
floor
exceeded
to
an
additional
attempt
by
the
senate
to
limit
the
participation
by
congress
on
this
issue
and
cut
it
down
to
the
two
issues
of
firemen
and
train
crew
which
eventually
where
the
two
issues
submitted
to
the
arbitration
board.
in
the
senate,
there
was
a
similar
development.
the
intention
of
the
administration
have
expressed
by
secretary
wirtz
was
again
repeatedly
conveyed
to
the
senate
committee,
repeatedly
exceeded
to
expressly
by
senators
before
that
committee.
a
very
significant
thing
happened
in
the
senate
in
our
view.
mr.
shane,
one
of
the
leading
witnesses
for
the
brotherhoods,
said
to
the
senate
committee,
“i
think
there
was
a
great
danger
of
having
the
interstate
commerce
commission
handle
this
dispute
because
of
section
5-11
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
maybe
this
is
why
the
railroads
want
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
handle
it
because
section
5-11
does
appear
to
give
the
power
to
the
railroad,
a
power
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
preempt.”
this
was
also
commented
on
by
mr.
ginane,
on
behalf
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
pointing
out
that
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
if
congress
was
going
to
key
this
matter
to
the
interstate
commerce
act,
that
they
should
make
sure
that
section
5-11,
it
could
probably
take
the
instructions
of
congress.
but
if
they
want
to
make
doubly
sure,
it
should
say
that
section
5-11
does
not
apply
the
public
law
88-108,
it
would
finally
come
out.
congress
did
more
than
take
out
section
5-11
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
congress
dropped
the
interstate
commerce
act
altogether.
and
they
said
in
their
reports
and
on
the
floor,
the
reason
we
are
dropping
reference
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
because
the
railway
brotherhoods
don't
want
it.
and
the
railway
brotherhoods
told
the
senate
committee
is
the
reason
we
don't
want
it,
a
reason,
a
detailed
explanation
of
this
is
because
we're
afraid
the
preemptive
effect
of
section
5-11
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
here
again,
the
senate
joined
what
was
the
clear
house
understanding
about
this
lack
of
preemptive
effect.
this
is
not
a
case
as
some
of
the
early
national
labor
relations
act
cases
cited
by
the
appellees
where
this
court
has
to
make
a
judgment
about
what
an
average
imaginary
congressman
would
have
intended
if
he'd
thought
about
the
matter.
these
people
thought
about
the
matter,
they
talked
about
the
matter
and
over
and
over
said,
it's
not
their
intention
to
preempt.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
to
be
completely
honest,
i
think
that
they
were
so
rushed
to
get
this
out.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
if
your
honor
please,
what
i
think
mr.
ginane
pointed
out
was
only
in
reference
to
the
time
when
they
were
considering
having
the
interstate
commerce
commission
arbitrate
the
dispute.
the
railroads
here
are
turning
this
into
a
broad
admonition
but
that
is
not,
i
respectfully
contend,
what
mr.
ginane
said.
mr.
ginane
said,
that
as
long
as
you're
going
to
have
the
interstate
commerce
act,
you
better
watch
out
if
you
be
doubly
certain
here,
you
better
watch
out
for
section
5-11
if
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
it
was
drafted
by
the
white
house.
it
was
presented
by
the
president
at
the
end
of
his
--
oh,
you
mean
the
final
legislation
or
the
initial
draft?
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
the
initial
draft
was
presented
by
the
president
at
the
end
of
his
speech
which
was
at
the
end
of
august
of
1963.
it
went
to
through
the
two
committees,
and
the
major
changes
that
were
made
by
the
committees,
is
that
both
committees
took
out
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
substituted
therefore
an
ad
hoc
arbitration
board.
there
was
an
additional
change
made
first
on
the
senate
floor
and
then
exceeded
to
on
the
house
floor
which
cut
the
issues
down.
exactly
where
it
occurred
in
the
senate,
i
don't
recall
for
sure
but
it
was
--
i
think
at
the
end
of
or
after
senate
deliberation,
which
cut
the
issues
down
to
just
the
two
issues
in
which
the
arbitration
board
finally
ruled
in
contrast
to
the
large
gamut
of
issues
president
kennedy
initially
asked
congress
to
consider.
the
railroads
have
responded
to
the
congressional
attempt
matter
by
pointing
to
mr.
ginane's
comments
on
which
i
have
already
referred
and
also
by
pointing
to
a
statement
of
representative
howard
smith.
immediately,
after
representative
harris,
the
chairman
of
the
commerce
committee
of
the
house
said,
“we
do
not
intend
to
preempt,
that's
what
our
report
says,
that's
what
norwood
says,
this
is
about
as
clear
as
we
can
make
it.”
representative
smith
got
up
and
he
said,
that
he
thinks
that
the
constitution,
not
public
law
88,
the
constitution
prevents
the
states
from
affecting
interstate
commerce
and
that
insofar
as
interstate
railroads
are
concerned,
he
understand
that
the
constitution
bans
this.
i
submit,
that
this,
number
one,
has
not
responsive
to
public
law
88-108
and
number
two,
is
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
which
and
--
would
have
made
norwood
invalid
without
any
public
law
88-108.
it
was
certainly
the
understanding
of
the
arbitration
board
that
they
were
not
to
overrule
full-crew
laws
and
they
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
one
of
their
--
in
their
explanation
about
their
award,
they
say
--
it
suggested
that
we're
going
to
take
all
kind
of
people's
jobs
away
from
them.
but
the
arbitration
board
says,
“no,
that's
not
so.”
because
of
a
several
factors,
one,
is
a
protective
provisions,
but
number
two
is,
the
provisions
of
state
full-crew
laws
which
protect
people's
jobs.
the
arbitration
board
in
doing
that
was
echoing
what
the
railroad
said
to
congress.
they
urged
congress,
“please
pass
this
resolution
and
take
us
out
of
this
problem
about
full-crews.”
and
then
they
said
to
congress,
orally
and
in
written
form,
as
is
cited
in
my
brief
and
again
it's
in
the
appendix
--
they
said,
--
everybody
said,
“we're
trying
to
fool
this
people
out
in
the
street.”
it's
not
like
that
at
all
because
17,000
positions
are
protected
by
state
full-crew
laws
that
the
arbitration
board
can't
touch.
so,
this
court
has
noted
before
in
the
chicago
river
case,
it
was
the
understanding
of
both
contending
parties
in
this
very
hotly
contested
matter
that
congress
was
not
preempting.
and
for
the
railroads
now
to
come
and
say,
“oh,
yes,
they
were,”
is
only
they
are
saying
in
effect
we
believe
that
--
a
very
inconsistent
thing
to
be
kind.
now,
in
conclusion,
it
is
a
late
blooming
argument
particularly
in
the
amicus
briefs
here
that
by
one
giant
sweep
of
the
judicial
sword
in
this
case,
we
can
take
care
of
this
whole
problem.
we
cannot
only
say
things
about
the
state
full-crew
laws;
we
can
talk
about
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
award
conditions
continue.
it's
the
position
of
the
brotherhoods,
they
do
not
continue.
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
award
in
early
1966,
that
the
situation
prior
to
the
passage
of
public
law
88-108
will
be
reenacted.
in
any
event,
congress
is
now
considering
these
various
--
this
very
problem.
in
any
event,
this
matter
--
the
railroads
are
now
arguing
to
a
senate
committee
and
in
some
of
this
hearing,
they're
cited
by
the
railroads
in
their
brief.
arguing
to
a
senate
committee,
that
we
better
do
something
about
the
time
when
this
award
expired.
now
again,
this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
a
matter
for
congress
to
determine.
it's
a
hot
issue,
and
both
sides
have
extremely
strong
views
on
it
and
the
views
were
presented
in
detail.
we
think
that
the
place
for
the
presentation
of
those
views
is
congress
or
is
the
state
legislature.
the
railroads
repeatedly
say,
“state
legislature
are
repealing
full-crew
laws
that
shows
how
old
fashion
they
are.
maybe
that's
so,
and
that's
where
they
should
be
if
that's
so.
and
we'll
argue
about
that
in
that
forum.”
but
this
court
in
all
kinds
of
battlefield,
in
due
process
field,
in
political
questions
field,
has
said,
“it's
not
for
congress
to
oversee.
it's
not
for
this
court
to
oversee
either
congress
or
the
state
legislature
about
these
clashes
of
fact
and
opinion.”
this
is
not
a
matter
for
the
judicial
sword.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
very
process
of
argument
is
of
some
value.
that
the
very
process
of
compromised,
the
very
process
of
adjusting
state
power
to
federal
power
being
that
it
was
considered
by
congress,
being
that
it
is
considered
by
state
legislature
are
something
for
those
bodies
to
consider
rather
than
for
this
court
to
consider
and
it
is
asking
the
court
to
go
beyond
what
has
been
its
concept
of
its
function
in
those
cases
in
this
particular
preemption
case.
i
like
to
retain
the
rest
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
take
our
remaining
time
primarily
by
attempting
to
fill
out
the
answers
on
the
legislative
history
given
by
distinguished
counsel
for
the
appellees
to
the
question
from
the
court.
first,
as
to
the
last
or
one
of
the
last
problems
that
was
raised
in
their
argument
about
the
two-year
expiration
of
award
and
about
the
conditions
going
on
from
then,
i
submit
that
by
and
large,
this
is
not
a
problem
that
is
raised
in
this
case
to
this
court.
i
submit
as
the
amicus
briefs
frankly
say
and
boldly
say
to
the
national
railway
labor
conference
for
example,
and
what
they'd
like
to
have
is
a
ruling
from
this
court
on
the
arkansas
full-crew
law
which
they
could
then
use
to
go
and
stop
a
strike
and
require
a
whole
series
of
new
notices
when
the
awards
expire.
that
is
a
practical
effect
of
this
point
as
i
believe
the
railroads
are
raising
it.
now,
congress
as
they
point
out
in
their
brief
is
right
now
considering
the
effects
of
public
law
88-108
and
the
affects
of
the
arbitration
award,
congress
is
considering
that
after
request
to
the
railroads
to
extend
that
award
for
another
two
years.
some
of
these
legislative
proceedings
are
quoted
in
the
briefs
--
in
this
brief
of
the
railroad
appellee.
this
is
a
problem
which
is
a
difficult
one
for
congress.
and
i
--
but
i
submit
that
it
is
not
a
problem
as
a
matter
of
policy.
it
is
a
matter
of
difficult
decisions
between
competing
interests
which
is
not
appropriate
to
a
decision
on
preemption
of
state
full-crew
laws
in
this
case.
in
(inaudible)
--
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
statement
about
we
are
asking
for
and
legislative
history
compelled
or
suggests
a
bizarre
result,
i
think
this
is
true,
it's
a
bizarre
situation.
it
always
has
been,
it
has
been
for
years.
congress
knew
it
was
a
bizarre
situation
and
was
so
reluctant
and
repeatedly
said
that,
“if
there's
only
some
way
we
could
do
something
about
this
the
party
we
only
agree
and
then
they
would've
became
apparent.
they
would
not
agree,
they
took
the
most
conceivably
limited
action
they
could
take.”
and
now
they
are
back
to
the
point
at
which
congress
consider
this
again
and
what
congress
will
do,
i
don't
know
but
i
do
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
it
be
--
reason
about
the
problem
for
that
--
well,
alright.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that's
correct.
and
that,
if
i
may
submit,
was
true
before
public
law
88-108
was
ever
submitted
--
thought
about
by
anyone.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
now,
there
are
few
legislative
history
factors
in
addition
to
those
that
have
been
discussed
or
in
expansion
of
those
that
have
been
discussed.
first,
as
to
what
was
done
in
the
senate
as
distinguished
from
what
was
done
in
the
house
if
there
is
a
distinction.
the
senate
report
did
say
this
and
this
is
about
as
close
to
a
reference
to
this
kind
of
issue
as
i
could
find.
senate
report
said,
“this
proposal
is
not
and
cannot
conceivably
be
considered
the
precedent
for
the
railroad
industry,
the
transportation
industry
generally
or
any
other
labor
management
dispute.
it
is
what
it
purports
to
be
a
one
shot
solution
to
legislative
means
to
a
situation
which
imperiled
beyond
question
the
economy
and
security
of
the
entire
nation.”
now
that
situation,
the
railroad
need
to
be
reminded
was
not
crew
sizes.
that
situation
was
a
threat
in
strike.congress
acted
that
congress
said
it
acted
only
to
stop
the
strike
in
contrast
to
what
the
appellees
urge
in
this
court.
i
would
like
to
expand
a
little
bit
in
what
the
railroads
say
they
said
before
congress
in
fact,
and
this
happen
also
in
the
senate
and
i
think
that's
a
point
of
some
importance.
it
happens
both
in
the
house
and
senate.
the
railroad
said,
“we
understand
that
public
law
88-108
is
not
to
preempt,
it's
not
to
affect
state
full-crew
law.”
they
said
that
to
both
the
house
committee
and
to
the
senate
committee.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
mean
mr.
wolff
who
was
the
chief
negotiator
for
the
railroad
and
who
was
the
chief
witness
for
the
railroads
in
the
committee
and
mr.
loomis
who
was
president
of
the
association
of
american
railroads.
both
of
whom
were
the
leading
spokesman
for
the
railroad
before
the
two
committees.
further
and
this
again
happened
in
the
senate
and
this
has
reference
to
the
problem
of
the
senate
not
expressing
itself.
in
a
written
memorandum,
a
written
statement
of
position
by
the
association
of
american
railroads
and
the
national
railway
labor
conference
which
is
in
the
record
of
a
senate
proceeding
they
gave
a
statement
answering
what
the
brotherhoods
had
said
to
them
about
the
effect
of
this
resolutions.
and
in
that
statement
they
said,
“it
is
being
said
by
the
brotherhoods
that
we
are
urging
this
resolution
to
put
all
these
men
out
in
the
street”,
that
it
will
not
have
that
effect
is
due
to
the
following
factors
and
it
makes
a
list.
and
at
the
top
of
the
list
literally,
number
one
in
the
list
of
reasons
is
the
fact
that
there
are
17,000
of
these
men
were
protected
by
state
full-crew
laws
and
then
they
have
a
chart
which
shows
although
there
are
70,000
or
80,000
people
possibly
affected
by
the
arbitration
award
it
really
isn't
that
bad
because
state
full-crew
laws
protect
17,000
to
18,000.
and
now
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
the
railroads
themselves
in
a
written
statement
of
position
submitted
to
the
senate
committee.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
sir.
and
the
statement
itself
was
signed
by
the
railroads
as
an
organization.
the
precise
name
of
the
signing
party,
i
am
quite
sure
it
was
the
association
of
american
railroads
and
the
national
railway
labor
conference.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
no,
it's
in
the
legislative
history
and
it's
cited
on
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
and
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
say
the
legislative
history
shows.
i
say
that
congress
want
to
meet
this
issue
with
that
--
the
most
minimum
impact
it
could.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor,
they
said
that
repeatedly.
now,
i
mentioned
yesterday
for
example,
mr.
shane
who
is
the
general
counsel
for
the
union
equivalent
--
brotherhood
equivalent
of
the
national
railway
labor
conference,
national
railway
labor
executive
said
when
we
are
talking
about
the
icc
if
in
fact
the
interstate
commerce
commission
might
be
the
arbitrating
body.
mr.
shane
said,
“i
think
this
is
what
the
railroads
want
because
they
know
about
section
511
to
which
mr.
ginnane
had
already
pointed.
they
know
about
section
511
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
appears
to
give
authority
to
supersede
state
laws.”
and
i
think
that
they
are
trying
to
in
effect
sneak
this
through.
and
he
said
something
like
that
to
the
senate
and
it
was
the
senate
as
the
railroads
point
out
that
led
in
taking
out
the
icc
as
the
arbitrating
body.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
no,
it
is
my
recollection
that
they
did
not
from
the
complete
reading
of
the
legislative
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
it
was
in
the
--
submitted
by
the
railroad
but
not
by
the
brotherhoods.
the
railroad
submission
was
in
written
form
submitted
after
the
hearings
are
over
or
at
the
end
of
the
hearing.
and
presumably
in
response
to
what
the
brotherhoods
were
accusing
the
railroad
of
wanting
to
throw
these
men
off
in
the
street
and
that
was
the
phrase
the
railroads
used.
we
are
not
(inaudible)
off
the
street
and
the
overwriting
purpose
of
congress
in
this
was
a
desire
to
limit
its
action
as
much
as
possible
in
many
respects.
it
relates
to
the
test
of
pervasiveness
which
this
court
has
applied
in
evaluating
preemption
contentions
but
certainly,
it
didn't
want
to
do
anymore
than
it
absolutely
had
to
do
to
stop
the
strike
and
so
the
railroad
said,
“well,
don't
worry.
you
aren't
doing
too
much
here
because
there
are
17,000
people
protected
by
state
full-crew
laws.”
and
i
think
congress
had
relied
on
that
and
i
think
they
were
entailed
to
rely
on
that
in
contrast
to
what
the
railroads
are
now
urging
to
this
court.
i
would
like
to
say
the
railroads
relied
repeatedly
on
mr.
howard
smith,
if
i
may,
just
a
portion
of
the
sentence
of
mr.
howard
smith's
statement.
mr.
smith
said,
“in
the
matter
of
purely
intrastate
commerce
under
our
constitution,
the
state
of
course
would
have
authority
but
when
it
comes
to
dealing
with
interstate
commerce
i
think
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
are
such
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
a
state
can
overcome
the
power
of
the
federal
government
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause.”
he
wasn't
talking
about
public
law
88-108
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
this
is
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief
which
had
the
legislative
history
which
is
on
page
73
of
my
brief.
he
was
talking
about
a
constitutional
theory
which
i
submit
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
norwood
decision
as
to
full-crew
laws
where
this
court
said
the
state
can
in
the
matter
of
a
certain
kind
affect
interstate
commerce
not
to
speak
of
a
long
line
of
decisions
since
that
time.
as
to
what
(inaudible)
what
mr.
ginnane
said
in
his
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
of
yesterday,
the
railroads
are
expanding
and
mr.
ginnane's
statement
into
a
statement
that
if
you
want
to
be
sure
you
want
a
preempting
you
got
to
go
ahead
and
put
in
the
law.
now,
that's
not
what
mr.
ginnane
said.
mr.
ginnane
was
talking
about
a
specific
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
a
matter
which
is
actually
academic
and
moot
in
view
of
the
fact
that
both
houses
took
the
interstate
commerce
act
reference
out
of
the
resolution
all
together.
but
secondly,
let's
assume
that
mr.
ginnane's
--
should've
--
just
should've
brought
to
mind
to
the
congress
the
idea
that
they
should
do
something
specific.
much
more
often
than
mr.
ginnane
statements
were
quoted
to
congress,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
norwood
and
the
particular
statement
of
this
court
in
norwood
that
unless
and
until
congress
expressly
said
to
the
contrary
state
full-crew
laws
remain.
i
submit
that
congress
was
entitled
to
rely
on
this
statement
in
reference
to
what
have
to
put
in
the
legislation
and
i
submit
that
this
was
said
by
mr.
wirtz.
it
was
repeatedly
--repeated
by
railroad
spokesman
who
quoted
mr.
wirtz.
it
was
said
by
oren
harris
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representative.
this
court's
norwood
statement,
again,
i
don't
say
of
course
that
it's
binding
in
any
sense
but
it
certainly
is
persuasive
evidence
that
congress
had
the
right
to
rely
on
things,
nothing
in
the
legislation.
it
is
the
contextual
factor
in
relation
to
what
is
actually
there
that
is
overwhelming
in
denial
of
the
whole
preemption
point
it
seems
to
me.
the
court
below
ruled
and
said,
“we
are
impressed
the
court
said
where
the
need
for
an
orderly
system
of
transportation."
the
railroads
in
the
amicus
frankly
say,
“let's
sweep
this
whole
thing
clean
in
this
case
and
just
have
a
whole
series
of
rules.”
we
submit
that
this
is
beyond
function
in
this
case,
your
honor.
