mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
presentation,
i
will
amplify
somewhat
the
history
that's
already
been
given
of
the
arkansas
laws
involved
in
the
scope
of
their
coverage,
the
exceptions
they
contain
and
also
a
--
give
a
somewhat
detail,
the
history
of
the
dispute
which
gave
rise
to
the
passage
of
public
law
88-108
in
1963.
i'll
discuss
the
scope
and
contents
of
the
awards
and
demonstrate
it
by
their
terms.
they
are
in
irreconcilable
conflict
of
the
state
statutes
here
involved
which
also
purport
to
fix
the
size
of
train
crews.
and
i'll
also
discuss
our
contention
entirely
apart
from
the
preemption
issues
raised
in
a
position
that
has
gone
unanswered
here
and
indeed
we
think
is
unanswerable,
that
these
laws
amount
to
an
impermissible
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
and
in
favor
of
intrastate
commerce,
as
distinguished
from
the
lower
frequent
undue
burden
on
commerce
contention.
my
colleague
mr.
lyons
will
develop
our
position
that
no
alleged
safety
exception
saves
these
particular
laws
from
the
preemption
by
the
federal
legislation
with
which
they
are
in
conflict.
he
will
also
discuss
the
congressional
intent
of
incorporating
and
integrating
public
law
88-108
into
the
railway
labor
act,
instead
of
into
the
interstate
commerce
commission
procedure
as
was
first
proposed
by
the
president.
he
will
also
develop
the
congressional
intention
with
respect
to
the
two-year
limitation
which
was
contained
in
public
law
88-108.
in
1907
statute,
first
to
the
arkansas
statutes
here
involved,
requires
a
crew
of
six
men
spelling
them
out
by
position
-
engineer,
fireman,
conductor,
and
a
three
brakemen
on
every
free
train
operated
in
arkansas
that
meets
the
specification
of
that
act.
the
vast
majority
of
the
free
trains
operated
by
these
six
plaintiff
railroad
companies
in
arkansas
do
meet
the
specifications
prescribed
by
that
act.
the
act
also
spells
out
that
its
heavy
burden
will
be
imposed,
“regardless
of
any
modern
equipment”
that
may
be
placed
on
those
railroad
trains
and
it's
spoken
that
language
of
modern
equipment
in
the
year
1907.
the
act
contains
these
exemptions.
it
does
not
apply
to
railroad
with
less
than
50
miles
of
line.
i
will
discuss
that
exemption
as
it
lays
the
burden
of
this
act
on
interstate
commerce
alone
exempting
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
may
it
please
the
court.
at
recess
yesterday,
i
was
discussing
the
first
of
the
two
arkansas
laws
here
in
dispute.
the
1907
act
which
prescribes
a
minimum
crew
on
freight
trains
operated
in
arkansas
meeting
its
specifications
of
six
members
directing
that
they
be
engineer,
fireman,
conductor
and
three
brakemen.
the
act
provides
those
requirements
by
its
own
terms
regardless
of
any
modern
equipment
that
maybe
placed
on
the
trains.
the
act
prescribes
a
penalty
of
not
less
than
$100,
not
less
than
$500
every
train
run
to
constitute
a
separate
violation
of
the
act.
the
six
plaintiff
railroads
in
this
case
operate
thousands
of
trains
in
arkansas
each
year
which
is
not
operated
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act,
staff
with
six
men
would
constitute
a
violation.
the
exceptions
contained
in
the
act
or
that
it
does
not
apply
to
railroads
having
less
than
50
miles
of
line
and
that
it
does
not
apply
to
trains
with
less
than
25
cars.
the
other
act
passed
in
1913
prescribes
a
similar
crew
of
six
men
for
switch
crews
operated
in
arkansas
meeting
its
specifications.
a
similar
penalty
with
a
similar
provision
that
every
switch
crew
operated
without
complying
with
it
shall
constitute
a
separate
violation
is
contained.
its
exceptions
are
to
railroad
companies
with
less
than
100
miles
of
line.
i
will
discuss
later
this
morning
the
effect
of
the
100-mile
and
the
50-mile
exceptions
as
they
bring
the
impact
to
these
statutes
on
the
interstate
railroads
operating
in
arkansas
only
and
fully
exempt
the
17
intrastate
railroads
from
the
burdens
of
these
acts.
if
other
exception
in
the
switch
crew
law
is
that
it
does
not
apply
to
switching
operations
which
are
conducted
outside
of
cities
of
the
second
class
and
not
over
public
crossings.
the
exception
with
respect
to
switching
operations
not
in
cities
of
the
first
or
second
class
which
is
the
way
the
statute
describes
it
is
not
meaningful
and
that
in
arkansas,
a
city
of
the
second
class
is
one
with
at
least
500
inhabitants
but
there
are
provisions
whereby
lesser
towns
can
vote
to
become
cities
of
the
second
class
without
having
the
requisite
500
inhabitants.
that
exclusion
probably
has
no
application
to
any
switching
operation
in
arkansas.
these
statutes
of
arkansas
are
the
most
extreme
form
of
this
type
of
legislation
that
the
states
have
undertaken
to
enact.
no
similar
statutes
have
been
undertaken
by
arkansas
nor
by
any
other
state
to
my
knowledge
to
burden
competing
forms
of
transportation
such
as
buses
and
trucks
and
barges
and
airplanes.
the
states
do
not
undertake
to
prescribe
the
level
of
crew
operation
or
the
level
of
crew
staffing
for
passenger
buses
for
example.
it
is
extreme
in
the
sense
that
it's
the
most
extreme
regulation
in
the
sense
that
among
the
seven
states
that
still
have
operable
crew
consist
statutes
arkansas
being
one
of
them.
none
of
them
provide
for
a
higher
level
of
manning
than
the
arkansas'
six
men
freight
crew
statute.
none
of
them
provide
other
than
arkansas
for
--
has
higher
level
as
the
six
men
switch
crew
statute.
there
are
no
other
full-crew
statutes
that
purport
to
prescribe
so
high
a
requirement
as
the
arkansas
switch
crew
statute.
arkansas
has
historically
had
the
most
burdensome
of
these
full-crew
statutes
which
no
doubt
accounts
for
the
fact
that
it
is
the
arkansas
statutes
that
had
been
before
this
court
for
examination
on
several
occasions.
the
extent
of
the
burden
imposed
on
commerce
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i'm
attempting
to
describe
the
statutes
in
the
light
of
the
burden
they've
imposed
and
the
impact
they
imposed
on
interstate
commerce
both
with
respect
to
our
preemption
argument
and
with
respect
to
our
position
that
these
constitute
an
unlawful
and
impermissible
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
earlier
cases
on
the
arkansas
full-crew
statutes,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
only
to
the
extent
of
the
norwood
case
is
holding
in
1931
that
there
was
no
preemption
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
they
then
stood.
that
would
be
the
only
extent
to
which
you
would
approach
overruling
their
cases.
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
burden
on
commerce
argument,
your
honor,
has
never
been
made
in
these
cases
until
its
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
now
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
no
sir.
i
misunderstood
you.
the
discrimination
against
commerce
argument
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
which
we
now
make
has
not
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
burden
on
commerce
argument
presents
factual
issues.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it
is
raised
in
the
compliant
and
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir,
yes
sir
in
each
of
them
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
it
was.
in
light
of
the
railroad
technology
that
have
been
existing
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
thoroughly
your
honor
for
13
--
the
board
itself
held
extensive
hearings
for
i
think
some
29
days
used
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
they
did
explore
the
safety
aspects,
the
work
load
aspects
saying
always
that
its
paramount
consideration
was
safety.
it
took
it
--
the
congress
had
directed
that
the
paramount
consideration
be
safety
which
indeed
it
had.
the
cost
of
compliance
of
these
statutes
in
arkansas
on
the
six
plaintiff
railroads
is
fixed
by
the
parties
in
the
pleadings
to
range
between
$6
million
and
something
a
little
more
than
$8
million
per
year.
that
is
the
cost
the
railroad
companies,
the
plaintiff
railroad
companies
that
much
more
to
operate
in
compliance
with
the
statutes
than
it
would
if
it
were
free
of
the
inhibitions
of
the
statutes
and
could
operate
in
compliance
with
the
awards
rendered
under
public
law
88-108.
the
significance
of
the
cost
of
the
compliance
is
that
it
illustrates
again
the
very
substantial
impact
these
laws
have
on
the
interstate
commerce
conducted
by
these
six
railroad
companies.
there
--
the
time
does
not
allow
a
full
discussion
of
all
of
the
references
in
the
debates
and
in
the
committee
hearings
that
ultimately
resulted
in
the
passing
of
public
law
88-108
of
references
to
the
full-crew
laws
or
to
the
preemption
problem.
in
summary,
it
can
be
stated
that
some
of
the
congressmen
expressed
an
apprehension
or
a
guess
that
the
full-crew
laws
would
be
sustained.
others,
likewise,
concluded
that
they
would
be
preempted
by
the
legislation
that
was
then
under
consideration.
i
--
those
hearings
are
voluminous.
the
district
court
has
carefully
gone
through
them,
it
has
filed
an
opinion
something
in
excess
of
50
pages
analyzing
that
legislative
history
and
its
conclusion
which
i
think
fully
is
sustained
by
so
much
of
the
legislative
history
as
it
is
contained
in
those
proceeding
before
congress
was
if
any
rational
conclusion
is
to
be
drawn
from
a
legislative
history
on
the
question,
it
is
that
congress
intentionally
elected
not
to
include
a
saving
provision
for
such
laws
and
thereby
create
local
exceptions
to
the
authority
of
the
arbitration
board
to
fix
the
size
of
train
crews
on
a
nationally
uniformed
basis.
that
is
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
also
pointed
out
that
no
one
urged
to
it
that
this
law
was
ambiguous.
i
point
out
here
that
no
one
has
suggested
to
this
court
that
the
law
was
ambiguous
and
indeed
it
is
not,
no
one
is
--
no
one
has
had
any
difficulty
in
applying
or
determining
what
this
law
means.
and
the
district
court
recognized
that
in
light
of
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
many
cases
that
when
the
intention
of
congress
is
clearly
expressed
in
its
enactment,
it's
unnecessary
to
explore
through
volumes
of
congressional
debates
and
hearings
in
order
to
attempt
to
find
some
contrary
conclusion.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
the
basis
of
almost
all
of
what
you
related
is
secretary
wirtz's
testimony.
first,
i
believe
before
the
house
committee
to
the
effect
that
it
was
not
his
intent
to
the
extent
he
had
a
pardon
grafting
his
legislation
and
in
presenting
it
on
behalf
of
the
administration
to
affect
the
full-crew
legislation.
congressman
harris,
chairman
of
the
committee
said,
“well,
has
this
been
looked
in
too
carefully?
have
you
done
careful
research
on
it?
it
appears
to
me
that
it
would.”
and
he
then
asked
secretary
wirtz
if
he
could
point
to
him
where
in
either
this
legislation
or
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
was
provided
that
no
preemption
of
this
crew
consists
laws
would
be
accomplished
and
the
secretary
conceded
that
there
were
no
such
provisions
and
congressman
harris
asked
if
he
would
submit
a
legal
memorandum
on
the
point
so
that
thorough
research
could
be
before
the
committee.
and
the
memorandum
was
then
submitted
and
it
was
to
the
contrary
of
what
the
secretary
had
originally
suggested
was
his
opinion
and
that
is
that
quite
likely
this
legislation
in
its
then
formed
and
this
was
the
administration
legislation
i
thought
was
ultimately
passed
would
preempt
the
pro-consist
statutes
and
then
the
interstate
commerce
--
and
following
that,
all
of
the
rest
of
the
comments
that
pop
up
through
the
hearings
and
debate
usually
related
back
to
what
secretary
wirtz's
original
opinion
that
he
gave
the
house
committee
was
but
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
represented
the
views
of
those
congressmen
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
represented
the
views
of
those
congressmen
on
that
committee
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
as
to
what
the
court
might
hold.
but
when
that
was
presented
on
the
house
floor
the
chairman
of
the
committee
presented
it
and
read
that
segment
of
the
report.
the
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
do
not
recall
a
statement
of
the
chairman
of
the
icc.
i
recall
the
chairman
being
there
and
deferring
to
his
general
counsel,
mr.
ginnane
for
a
observation
on
it
and
mr.
ginnane
told
both
the
committees,
senate
and
the
house
that
this
is
likely
to
preempt
as
a
strong
argument
that
can
be
made
but
all
you
have
to
do
if
it's
the
intent
of
congress
and
he
underlined
that
in
both.
he
wasn't
being
presumptuous
enough
to
suggest
what
the
intent
of
congress
should
be
on
this
point.
he
said,
“if
it's
the
intent
of
congress
not
to
preempt,
they
can
be
easily
done
parenthetically,”
as
mr.
justice
white
said
with
two
or
three
words.
and
while
both
committees
had
that
admonition
that
if
it
was
their
intent
not
to
preempt,
it
would
be
a
very
simple
matter
to
amend
this
draft
and
while
it
was
amended
several
times
thereafter,
after
those
discussion
in
both
committees,
no
effort
was
made
to
insert
language
to
hear
this
court
guidance
as
to
the
intention
of
congress
to
preserve
this
full-crew
laws.
mr.
robert
v.
light
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
either
way.
mr.
robert
v.
light
either
way.
your
honor,
of
course
usually,
and
this
court
has
so
said
many
times
congress
has
presumed
to
act
in
a
fashion
where
its
legislation
is
nationally
applicable.
and
nationally
uniform
is
not
presumed
to
act
on
isolated
or
regional
problems
unless
it's
expressed
there.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
the
only
testimony
that
i
recall
on
that
was
from
a
representative
of
the
carriers
who
was
asked
about
it
and
he
said
that
really
all
he
knew
was
secretary
wirtz's
opinion
that
had
been
given
in
testimony
earlier
in
that
committee
or
another
one.
mr.
robert
v.
light
he
didn't
purport
to
adopt
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
not
to
my
recollection
sir.
the
only
thing
along
that
line
was
a
reference
to
the
opinion
that
had
been
expressed
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor
it
represented
the
views
of
those
congressmen
that
had
concurred
in
that
committee
report
would
be
my
view
of
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
as
i
recall
the
statement
of
mr.
youngdahl
and
i
presume
that
it's
correct
that
all
--
that
it
was
a
unanimous
report
that
not
all
of
the
committee
members
had
attended
but
--
it
all
had
had
conquered
in
the
report
but
of
course
when
that
report
was
read
on
the
floor
of
congress
mr.
justice
black
and
congressman
harris
says,
“this
our
report
in
our
view.”
congressman
smith
who
was
chairman
of
the
rules
committee
got
up
immediately
and
said
that,
“i
don't
dare
remain
silent
because
this
matter
hasn't
been
discussed
on
the
floor
of
the
house
before
but
it
was
discussed
in
the
rules
committee
yesterday."
and
it
went
on
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
and
speaking
in
his
capacity
as
chairman
of
the
rules
committee
that
had
considered
this
legislation
and
he
said
that
this
is
dealing
with
interstate
commerce
and
the
courts
have
gone
a
long
way
and
we've
gone
a
long
way
up
on
putting
these
things
under
interstate
commerce,
his
instrumentalities
commerce
and
he
challenged
the
conclusion
of
representative
harris
and
representative
harris'
committee.
congressman
edmondson
from
oklahoma
then
got
up
and
said,
“well,
my
understanding
of
it
would
be
then
that
all
we'd
leave
are
the
switch
of
the
crew
consist
laws
would
be
the
switching
operations,
local
switching
operations.”
and
congressman
says
--
smith
said,
“well,
so
it
just
depends
on
what
in
each
instance
is
called
interstate
commerce
or
how
far
we've
extended
in
the
interstate
commerce
but
we've
gone
a
long
way
in
this
and
i
don't
want
to
remain
silent
in
light
of
what
the
commerce
committee
is
telling
us
the
courts
might
do
in
this
instance.”
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
house,
interstate
and
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
the
foreign
commerce
committee,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
but
again,
we
urge
that
the
most
relevant
legislative
history
here
is
the
dispute
that
had
arisen,
it
hadn't
come
up
in
two
or
three
days.
it'd
been
broiling
for
years
and
years,
the
facts
that
prompted
congress
to
act
and
upon
which
it
did
act,
congress
was
here
resolved
in
a
dispute,
it
was
not
as
this
--
subject
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no
sir.
i
didn't
mean
that
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
my
response
to
it
your
honor
is
that
when
the
committee
report
was
received
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
that
--
that
the
accuracy
of
that
prognostication
in
it
was
then
debated
in
the
house
with
cong
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
i'm
--
in
pursuit
of
that,
i
might
say
that
the
senate
committee
contained
that
report,
contained
no
such
representation
as
to
whether
there
would
be
or
would
not
be
a
preemption
and
this
legislation
that
was
passed
actually
originated
in
the
senate
and
the
house
concurred
in
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
cannot
answer
that
your
honor.
but
it's
our
position
that
along
with
what
happened
in
the
house
and
what
happened
in
the
senate,
the
facts
congress
was
acting
on
is
vitally
important
here.
congress
was
not
interested
solely
in
preventing
a
strike
and
i
cannot
emphasize
that
too
strongly.
if
it
had
been
interested
solely
in
preventing
a
strike,
it
can
pass
a
law
forbidding
the
strike
in
which
event
the
railroad
companies
would
have
won
everything
that
they'd
provided
for
in
their
notices
because
the
parties
were
to
self-help
level
at
this
time.
or
congress
could
have
passed
a
law
prohibiting
the
railroad
companies
from
putting
into
effect
any
changes
contained
in
their
notice.
and
in
that
event,
the
railroad
brotherhoods
would've
won
everything
that
they
wanted.
congress
could've
prevented
the
strike
readily
but
what
it
was
doing
here
was
providing
a
solution
for
the
problem
providing
compulsory
arbitration
for
this
problem
of
automation
or
arising
out
of
automation
in
the
railroad
industry
that
have
been
brawling
for
years
and
that
was
threatening
a
serious
blow
to
the
nation's
economy.
mr.
robert
v.
light
in
that
connection,
it's
significant
to
know
what
congress
had
before
it
when
it
reached
the
point
of
deliberating
on
public
law
88-102.
it
had
before
it
the
fact
that
this
problem
had
been
an
issue
since
at
least
--
better
issues
since
at
least
the
early
1950's.
the
manning
of
trains
have
been
prior
to
that
time
determined
by
local
rules,
arrangements,
collective
bargaining
agreements,
crew
consist
laws
on
a
local
basis
with
a
sole
exception
that
the
firemen
were
placed
on
trains
on
the
night
--
on
the
basis
of
the
1937
diesel
agreement
which
was
a
national
agreement.
all
other
aspects
of
train
manning
other
than
the
firemen
would
be
on
its
locomotive
was
determined
on
a
local
basis
and
the
basis
that
it
is
--
was
a
multitude
of
differences
in
the
way
those
things
were
determined.
the
railroads
recognized
in
the
1950's
that
this
had
resulted
insubstantial
over
manning
in
the
railroad
industry
and
the
weakening
of
its
position
to
serve
is
the
prime
mover
of
freight
in
this
country.
they
went
to
president
eisenhower
in
the
late
1950's
and
sought
the
appointment
of
a
presidential
commission
to
investigate
and
offer
solutions
for
this.
in
the
face
of
our
position
from
the
railroad
brotherhoods,
the
president
declined
to
appoint
a
commission
at
that
time.
then
the
notice
is
preserved
and
the
notice
of
the
railroad
company
served
in
1959
provided
for
testing
and
management,
the
discretion
to
fix
the
railroad
crew
manning
levels
and
provided
for
setting
aside
all
preceding
rules,
interpretations,
agreements,
however
established.
the
brotherhoods
responded
in
1960
with
their
section
6
notices
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
put
a
national
rule
into
effect,
fixing
crew
consist
and
the
national
rule
labor
pose
is
lesser
--
a
lesser
number
of
men
than
the
arkansas
laws
prescribed.
there
followed
thereafter
many
efforts
at
mediation,
suggestions
and
offers
and
proposals
by
the
president,
by
the
president's
representatives,
the
secretary
of
labor
for
arbitration
of
this
dispute
always
accepted
by
the
railroad
companies,
always
rejected
by
brotherhoods.
and
that
is
the
background
that
brought
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
you
say
your
honor,
that
congress
might
have
said
that.
mr.
robert
v.
light
congress
might
have
said
it
either
way.
mr.
robert
v.
light
it
would
have
been
a
relative
simple
matter.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
if
it
does
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
cases
that
so
hold
but
again
the
absences
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
well
logically,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
follows.
for
example,
congressman
smith
supported
this
legislation
although
he
did
not
concur,
it's
obvious
--
is
obvious
from
the
debate
in
the
interpretation
that
the
committee
had
put
on
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
does
your
honor
because
it's
still
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
if
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
it
certainly
would
if
the
committee
had
caused
and
prompted
an
amendment
to
be
made
in
the
legislation
itself
and
said
it
is
not
intended
that
it
do
this,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
had
they
done
that.
