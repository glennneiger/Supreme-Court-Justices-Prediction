justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
--
could
i
ask
you
a
question
sir?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
by
if
the
award
terminates?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
at
the
end
of
two
years,
the
award
as
you
say
terminates
and
the
parties
are
in
an
argument
about
their
differences
including
this
one.exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they're
--
and
they're
an
argument,
well,
what
--
let's
take
in
a
state
that
doesn't
have
a
full-crew
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
what
terms
--
what
term
--
what
would
be
the
rules
governing
the
--
consist
of
crews?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
--
did
--
no
terms
after
the
end
of
two
years,
there
are
just
no
terms?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
wonder
again,
that's
not
my
question.
what
the
--
what
are
the
terms
for
crews
that
are
going
to
obtain
at
the
end
of
two
years
when
the
parties
--
if
the
parties
haven't
agreed
on
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
there
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
of
--
you
would
deny
that
there's
any
such
of
--
any
such
rule
in
this
context
that
the
terms
of
the
award
would
continue
until
changed
by
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
have
--
wouldn't
that
the
railroad
said
that
--
having
the
railroads
have
been
complying
with
the
full-crew
laws
in
arkansas?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can
just
talk
about
arkansas
together,
but
in
that
regard
can't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
--
mr.
youngdahl,
what
is
the
--
is
safety
the
primary
purpose
of
the
state
full-crew
laws,
is
that
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
congress
have
in
mind
that
the
arbitrators
of
what
the
--
the
district
arbitration
board
would
have
safety
considerations
in
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
they
taken
up
--
or
just
taken
under
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
in
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
can
an
argument
be
made
that
congress
did
have
a
necessarily
whether
they
said
so
or
not
have
state
full-crew
laws
in
mind
that
they
were
dealing
with
safety?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statute
then
is
abso
--
is
necessarily
limited
in
scope
or
to
--
or
necessarily
limited
the
arbitrators
to
settling
what
without
standing
as
between
the
notices
at
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
that
the
references
--
your
idea
that
the
reference
to
safety
in
the
act
was
no
more
than
what
the
parties
thought
they
were
free
to
do
about
safety?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
do
you
suppose
the
explanation
is
--
or
they're
not
saying
so,
it
was
so
clear
that
everyone
is
so
much
in
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
have
taken
two
or
three
words
as
mr.
ginane
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
pointed
out
to
the
house
committee.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
this
is
resolution
drafted
or
bill
drafted
to
this
legislation?
is
it
drafted
by
the
secretary
of
the
labor
department
or
in
the
committee
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
about
burden
on
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
sustaining
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
full-crew
laws
before
there
was
no
contention
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
the
burden
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
--
was
the
burden
on
commerce
argument
raised
and
considered
in
the
previous
full-crew
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
correct
--
justice
byron
r.
white
absolutely,
independent
and
separate
and
part
of
it.
the
practical
impact
of
these
statutes
on
the
interstate
commerce
upon
which
they
fall
can
best
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
findings
of
the
arbitration
board
created
by
public
law
88-108
and
the
two
impartial
boards
that
preceded
it
that
almost
every
train,
freight
train
running
this
nation
can
safely
be
operated
with
a
crew
of
not
in
excess
of
four
men
and
that
almost
every
switching
operation
that
takes
place
in
this
nation
can
safely
be
accomplished
with
crews
of
three
and
four
men
and
sometimes
less.
the
arkansas
laws
prescribed
an
inflexible
crew
of
six
men
in
every
such
instance
and
that
impact,
and
that's
the
substantial
impact,
is
demonstrable
from
the
findings
of
the
commission
that
had
examined
the
safety
aspects
of
this
to
determine
what
is
really
required
in
the
way
of
safety
and
efficiency
and
burden
and
workload
on
the
men
to
carry
out
this
railroad
operations
in
light
of
present
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lyons,
is
there
any
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
this
record
that
the
parties
in
negotiating
or
in
giving
their
notices
had
state
full-crew
laws
in
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
there
ever
been
any
concrete
instance
of
a
--
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
railroad
industries
setting
aside
a
--
or
prevailing
over
a
state
full-crew
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lyon,
what
--
this
would
--
runs
out
when?
this
coming
january,
isn't
it?
