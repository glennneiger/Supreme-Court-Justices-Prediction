mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
to
answer
the
question
that
justice
black
asked.
my
note
show
that
the
senate
report
was
filed
on
august
23rd
and
that
the
house
report
was
filed
on
august
26th,
whereas,
the
senate
reported
first.
it
was
the
senate
that
was
warned
particularly
by
mr.
ginnane,
the
general
counsel
of
the
icc
about
the
possibly
preemptive
effect
of
legislation
and
the
senate
did
not
include
the
saving
clause
and
the
senate
report
does
not
include
any
reference
one
way
or
the
other
to
be
sure
as
to
what
the
intent
of
the
senate
committee
was.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it's
simply
silent.
one
thing
that
it
does
i
think
dispose
of
is
the
suggestion
that
the
appellants
made
that
the
reason
why
the
senate
which
made
the
change,
made
the
change
from
the
icc
or
the
added
approach
to
the
railway
labor
act
arbitration
approach
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
question
of
supersession,
yes
or
no.
the
main
factors
that
seem
to
dominate
on
that
are
found
on
pages
8
and
9
of
the
senate
report.
and
the
problem
seem
to
have
been
the
workload
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
also
some
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
brotherhoods
that
they
would
not
get
as
fair
shape
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
terms
of
what
they
wanted
as
they
would
before
in
arbitration
board.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i'm
just
not
familiar
with
that
passage,
your
honor.
i'm
just
familiar
with
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
what
i
remember
from
that
is
that
he
deferred
to
the
--
to
mr.
ginnane.
and
mr.
ginnane
--
there
was
some
testimony
to
the
effect
that
if
congress
wanted
them
not
to
--
actually
to
supersede
the
state
laws
that
they
could
put
that
in
the
interim
rules
that
they
were
empowered
to
pass
under
the
legislation
and
that
is
the
way
that
they
would
take
care
of
the
problem
if
that
intent
of
congress
were
made
known
to
them.
but
the
--
but
that
was
not
the
approach
that
congress
came
out
with.
what
the
congress
came
out
with
the
approach
of
the
railway
labor
act,
arbitration
board
within
that
framework.
i
think
in
this
whole
consideration
of
legislative
history,
we
tend
to
lose
sight
of
one
thing
that
the
--
if
we
assume
from
anything
short
of
the
expressed
language
of
congress
in
the
act
that
congress
wanted
the
state
laws
to
remain
in
effect
states
to
have
powers
to
pass
and
to
put
into
effect
laws
in
this
area.
we
are
creating
a
situation
in
which
congress
in
effect
could've
permitted
the
entire
effect
of
the
arbitration
award
to
be
repealed
bit
by
bit
by
the
states.
certainly,
i
don't
think
anyone
could
contend
that
certain
states
would
have
the
power
to
pass
legislation
here
of
a
nature
of
this
full-crew
laws
or
that
there
was
some
sort
of
grandfather
clause
for
the
existing
full-crew
laws.
if
there
was
no
supersession
here,
then
anyone
of
the
50
states
could've
moved
into
this
area
and
regardless
of
what
the
award
said,
that
state
could've
taken
its
bite
out
of
the
award,
could've
kept
the
fireman,
could've
kept
the
level
of
crew
manning
in
the
train
service
that
the
--
had
prevailed
before.
the
states
could've
eaten
up
the
award
bit
by
bit
and
if
you
look
into
the
way
in
which
these
laws
get
enacted,
in
effect,
these
laws
are
substitute
for
the
collective
bargaining
process.
they
amount
to
the
efforts
of
the
brotherhoods
on
the
one
side
and
the
carriers
on
the
other
when
they
come
to
in
impasse
to
try
to
solve
it
through
legislation
one
way
or
the
other.
and
if
the
national
award
is
vulnerable
to
being
eaten
up
bit
by
bit
by
bit,
i
think
we've
got
a
very
strange
situation
for
an
act
of
congress
to
intend
that
and
i
would
suggest
respectfully
that
it
would
--
it
should
take
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute
before
we
should
come
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
believe
anyone
adverted
to
the
fact
that
the
states
after
all
are
on
an
equal
footing
that
one
would
--
one
state
could
constitutionally
have
done
in
1907
another
state
might
well
constitutionally
do
in
1963
or
1964.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
this
was
the
legislation
that
was
passed
in
the
troughs
of
great
national
emergency.
the
full-crew
law
references
in
the
debates
are
a
tiny,
tiny
part
of
the
entire
consideration
that
congress
gave
to
these
prices
which
was
threatening
to
tie-up
the
country
to
cost
laws
of
essential
production
to
bring
many
of
the
principle
wheels
to
a
--
in
--
of
the
nation
to
a
standstill.
i
think
to
a
considerable
extent
and
just
the
extent,
just
the
proportion
of
the
discussion
of
the
full-crew
laws
to
the
entire
bulk
of
the
issue
was
referring
at
this
time.
and
they
were
talk
--
don't
forget
that
were
talking
about
a
fireman
rule
that
was
in
effect
nationally
and
they
were
talking
about
a
national
rail
strike.
i
think
that
in
effect,
this
issue
was
not
fully
considered
in
the
debates
as
an
entirety
and
i
--
there
was
of
course
congressman
smith's
challenge
to
the
house
report
on
the
floor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
light.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
understood
mr.
light's
argument
to
be
of
the
--
that
the
whole
issue,
the
issue
of
the
1937
diesel
agreement
that
kept
the
fireman
and
the
manning
levels
generally
have
been
subject
to
dispute
for
years
and
years.
the
extent
of
the
consideration
that
was
given
to
the
place
of
the
state
manning
level
laws
in
the
midst
of
these,
i
don't
think
was
substantial.
the
two
bases
apart
from
the
remarks
that
were
made
in
the
legislative
history
on
which
i
understand
that
the
appellants
are
principally
contending
that
what
should
be
after
all
here,
the
ordinary
force
of
a
federal
enactment
of
this
sort,
supersession
of
the
inconsistent
state
laws
are
that
the
state
laws
because
they
are
safety
oriented
somehow,
enjoy
a
preferred
status.
and
secondly,
because
of
the
emergency
or
temporary
as
it's
called,
the
character
of
the
federal
act
that
there
should
also
for
that
reason
be
held
not
to
be
supersession.
i
should
like
to
talk
to
those
two
points
in
turn.
first,
as
to
the
safety
point,
whatever
one
may
think
of
the
relationship
of
these
statutes
to
safety
that
may
have
been
their
justification
in
1907
to
what
extent
they
are
now
justified
by
that
is
an
issue
that
remains
to
be
tried.
the
one
thing
about
them
that
is
indisputable
is
that
they
are
entirely
different
from
the
usual
sort
of
railroad
safety
statute
that
we
think
about,
they
are
not
like
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
or
like
the
rule
about
cabooses
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
terminal
railroad
case
back
in
1942.
they
are
not
like
the
usual
sort
of
industrial
health
and
safety
regulation
about
protective
clothing
or
about
sanitary
facilities
or
about
drinking
water.
what
they
do
is
that
they
go
--
these
laws
go
directly
to
the
two
central
points
in
the
labor
management
economic
situation
and
i
understand
those
two
points
to
be
jobs
and
money
and
these
laws
go
direct
jobs
to
that
question.
to
be
true,
they
might
have
a
further
safety
aspect
but
the
central
fact
about
them
is
that
they
directly
regulate
the
principle
labor
management
economic
problem
in
this
industry.
they
regulate
the
very
thing
that
we
would
think
that
the
parties
would
first
address
themselves
to
in
collective
bargaining.
the
question
that
probably
is
coequal
with
the
question
of
wages
and
collective
bargaining,
the
number
of
jobs
to
be
provided
by
each
train
and
this
of
course
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
sir.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
can
point
you
on
that
your
honor
is
that
62
and
61
and
66
of
the
record,
the
text
of
the
notices.
the
text
of
the
carrier
proposed
all
is
to
eliminate
all
agreements,
rules,
regulations,
interpretations,
and
practices,
however,
established
and
the
same
as
the
firemen
notice,
the
same
as
true
as
to
the
notice
as
to
the
train
men.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
and
i
think
its
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
only
prior
--
present
to
this
case
has
to
do
with
the
state
civil
service
law
which
was
involved
in
california
v.
taylor.
that's
the
only
one
in
the
railway
labor
act.
the
leading
case
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
of
course
the
oliver
case
where
a
contract
between
labor
and
management
prevailed
over
a
state
antitrust
law
but
the
--
i
don't
even
know
of
any
instance
in
which
there
has
been
this
conflict
to
certain
--
in
fact,
i'm
not
aware
that
the
parties
have
ever
been
able
to
bargain
into
a
conflict
through
a
final
bargaining
solution.
what
you
frequently
have
and
in
fact
the
--
what
we
seem
to
be
getting
into
now
in
the
case
of
the
repeal
of
some
of
these
statutes
some
of
the
collective
bargaining
contracts
that
have
been
entered
into
since
the
award
and
while
this
litigation
has
been
pending
have
provided
that
the
brotherhoods
will
not
contest
their
repeal
of
the
state
full-crew
statutes.
our
first
contention
with
respect
to
the
so-called
safety
feature
of
this
statute
is
that
because
this
statute
so
centrally
regulate
the
basic
labor
management
economic
relationship
that
they
are
a
matter
in
which
the
parties
agreement
or
in
which
of
an
award
to
an
arbitration
board
should
prevail
as
the
collective
bargaining
contracts
in
fact
prevailed
in
taylor
and
in
oliver.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
say
that
your
honor.
i
say
that
the
--
since
the
acts
directly
go
to
the
labor
management
relationship
and
involve
something
that
is
governed
by
federal
law
to
that
extent
that
if
there
is
anything
--
any
limit
to
what
parties
can
agree
to
or
what
the
arbitrators
provide
in
the
name
of
safety
that
there
should
be
a
federal
statute
providing
that
in
congress
of
course
is,
though
frequently
asked,
never
passed
a
national
crew
consist
statute.
this
is
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
award
will
no
longer
be
in
effect
as
an
award
as
to
firemen
on
march
31,
1966
as
to
the
train
men
and
the
switch
men
on
january
25,
1966.
now,
the
rules
as
we
contend
imposed
by
the
award
remain
in
effect
as
rules
as
it
--
subsisting
and
existing
rules
under
the
railway
labor
act
until
changed
through
the
notice
procedure
of
section
6
and
the
exhaustion
of
the
mediation
procedure
and
the
emergency
board
procedure.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
think
it
--
well,
there
is
no
case
where
in
point
on
this,
of
course
this
is
the
sort
of
compulsory
arbitration
involved
that
congress
has
never
had
this
passed
before.
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
railway
labor
act
is
that
contracts
and
awards
that
have
specific
terms
in
them
for
a
specific
term
that
at
the
close
of
that
term
all
that
happens
is
the
parties
then
can
go
into
the
collective
bargaining
procedure.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
its
functions
as
an
award
your
honor,
section
8
(j)
of
the
railway
labor
act
uses
similar
language
and
i
assume
it
was
the
precedent
for
this
language.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
the
award
has
no
further
force
as
of
march
31,
1965,
i
would
think
that
nonetheless
by
moving
in
for
a
two-year
period
or
presume
that
congress
did
move
into
the
situation
and
supersede
for
a
two-year
period
that's
--
it
--
that
the
interpretation
should
be
that
the
--
you
could
never
go
back
to
the
prior
pattern
unless
the
parties
bargain
back
to
it.
in
other
words,
once
congress
broke
the
mold
here
of
the
old
1937
diesel
agreement
and
as
we
contend
the
mold
imposed
by
the
state
laws
that
in
effect
it
had
a
chaotic
situation
if
you
went
back.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
would
think
so
your
honor
after
this
--
in
effect
this
episode
in
our
national
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
it's
off
the
books
your
honor
but
it
still
was
a
happening.
it
still
was
something
that
occurred
and
was
an
intrusion
of
congress
if
you
will
into
this
area
of
a
sort
that
had
far
reaching
effects.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
a
case
where
there
was
a
state
that
posed
this
problem.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
terms
of
what
congress
was
thinking
about
here
that
the
award
though
not
as
an
award
though
it
was
subject
to
opening
after
the
two
years
that
the
award
was
to
be
the
starting
place
for
the
collective
bargaining
of
the
parties
thereafter
and
that
you
didn't
automatically
go
back
to
the
situation
before
from
the
labor
protective
provisions
that
are
in
the
award
and
that
i
think
congress
fairly,
clearly
contemplated
would
be
in
the
award
every
public
body
that
had
given
its
recommendations
on
this
matter
had
recommended
that
there
be
protective
provisions
with
fireman.
and
that
there
be
some
form
of
continuation
in
jobs
for
the
train
men.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
congress
had
said
that
the
state
laws
should
be
superseded
for
two
years
only,
obviously,
there'd
be
no
basis
for
a
contention
to
the
contrary.
the
congress
clearly
spoke
on
this
matter
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
i
think
the
congress
clearly
spoke
the
other
way
in
terms
of
the
procedural
framework
into
which
they
poured
this
provision
for
compulsory
arbitration
because
while
they
said,
they
said
two
things
that
have
to
be
reconciled.
they
said
that
the
award
shall
remain
in
effect
for
two
years
and
that
of
course
what
8
(j)
of
the
railway
labor
act
says
about
an
arbitration
award
but
you
don't
go
back
to
the
status
quo
once
they
undo
that.
congress
also
said
in
the
statute
that
the
award
of
the
board
shall
constitute
a
complete
and
final
disposition
of
the
aforesaid
issues.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
and
what
it
said
also,
it
said
that
certainly
your
honor.
and
it
also
said
we
will
have
this
solution
which
will
cut
down
and
they
foresaw
that
it
would
cut
down
the
over
manning
that
would
reduce
the
fireman
and
reduce
the
trainmen
and
either
would
cut
down
part
of
the
problem
will
be
over
manning
that
the
railroads
were
concerned
about.
and
that
thereafter,
what
the
level
of
manning
that
you're
going
to
have
after
that
was
up
to
the
parties
but
of
course
they
had
to
do
it
under
the
terms
of
the
railway
labor
act.
a
lot
of
the
suggestions
to
the
contrary
that
this
was
an
emergency
or
temporary
legislation
that
the
ordinary
rules
of
supersession
shouldn't
apply
to
those
circumstances,
i
think
it
would've
been
better
taken
if
what
congress
had
done
here
would've
--
was
to
have
impose
the
moratorium,
congress
didn't
imposed
a
moratorium
here.
congress
didn't
say
to
the
unions
simply,
“thou
shalt
not
strike.
congress
didn't
say
simply
to
the
carriers,
“thou
shalt
not
put
into
effect
these
rules
doing
a
way
of
a
fireman.”
congress
said,
“we
will
provide
not
only
a
moratorium
that
will
call
off
a
strike
but
we
will
provide
a
machinery
whereby
there
would
be
a
solution.”
if
congress
itself
had
provided
that
90%
of
the
fireman's
jobs
were
to
be
eliminated
and
that
the
consist
on
the
trainman
was
to
be
a
conductor
and
two
train
men,
there
would
be
no
gain
saying
of
the
fact
that
the
state
law
as
to
the
contrary
couldn't
stand.
we
contend
that
when
congress
provided
not
only
for
a
procedural
stay
of
the
strike
and
of
the
carriers
self-help
but
also
for
a
solution
to
be
reached
through
an
arbitration
board
that
had
also
provided
in
that
forum
for
a
substantive
solution
to
this
controversy
and
that
the
substantive
solution
that
congress
provided
for
was
not
one
that
the
states
were
to
be
permitted
to
take
a
bite
out
of
here
and
a
bite
out
of
there
through
these
laws.
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
congress
intends
its
acts
to
be
of
nationwide
application.
if
this
is
going
to
provide
to
the
contrary
to
make
federal
law
dependant
upon
the
operation
of
state
law,
it
generally
clearly
said
so,
i
think
we'd
have
say
so
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
house
committee
senators
clearly
as
the
house
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
as
house
committee
could.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
but
cert
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
can't
speak
for
them
your
honor,
it
was
pretty
clearly
congressman
harris'
view
in
those
then
that
there
was
no
dissent
on
this
committee
to
be
sure.
it
was
not
congressman
smith's
view
as
to
what
the
construction
in
the
senate
is.
we
have
much
thinner
reads
and
i
think
the
inference
that
we
would
suggest
is
that
the
senate
did
not
pick
this
up,
the
senate
formulated
the
legislation
and
acted
first
in
its
report.
it
had
the
warning
from
mr.
ginnane
and
it
did
not
include
this
clause.
so,
i
think
we're
thrown
back
onto
the
test
of
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
result
that
would
be
reached
if
we
analyze
that
intent
one
way
or
the
other.

dennis
