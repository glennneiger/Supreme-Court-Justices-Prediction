where
is
that
quoted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
expressly
said
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
find
it
in
appendix
c.
that
seems
to
be
the
statements
by
people.
i
understood
you'd
say
that
is
in
the
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
light,
do
you
--
(inaudible)
asked
you
about
the
committee
report.
did
i
understand
your
only
reply
to
that
is
that
simply
represented
the
views
of
the
minimum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
many
of
them
concurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
congressman
smith
of
virginia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
commerce
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
a
regular
written
or
printed
report
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
such
as
they
may
and
put
on
the
desk
of
the
senators
and
congressmen?
justice

l.
black
with
a
full
committee
report
submitted
to
the
congress
and
did
it
make
the
statement
that
it
was
rendered
yesterday?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
was
enacting
on
the
report
of
the
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
had
some
experience
as
to
those
reports
and
this
is
committee
on
interstate
commerce
and
the
members
of
congress
accept
those
statements
upon
which
they
can
rely
what
the
bill
does
or
does
not
do.
and
the
only
statement
you
--
the
only
thing
you
have
for
--
a
file
to
that
is
statement
of
chairman
of
the
rules
committee
who's
not
on
the
interstate
commerce
committee,
said
nothing
to
do
with
the
hearings
or
anything
else,
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
of
course
someone
can
--
someone
can
say
that
that
the
man
gets
up
and
sometimes
they
do
that
because
they
want
to
put
something
in
to
show
that
they
are
raising
a
question.
but
this
gentleman
that
you
referred
to
is
not
on
the
interstate
commerce
committee,
is
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
made
the
first
report?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
committee
who
made
the
report
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
the
railroad
said
that,
who
do
you
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
you
say
did
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black

same
gentlemen
you
mentioned?
justice
hugo
l.
black

not
in
this
record,

it?
justice
hugo
l.
