mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i'm
jack
lessenberry,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
arkansas
as
the
counsel
for
the
appellees
in
case
number
71.
these
are
the
prosecuting
attorneys
which
--
as
it
might
develop,
the
court
will
recognize
that
are
nominal
parties
in
interest
in
this
case
initially,
this
case
as
mr.
chief
justice
had
noted,
has
been
consolidated
with
case
number
69
in
involving
the
railroad
brotherhoods.
the
--
its
imparities
that
i
initially
address
some
remarks
to
the
presentation
of
argument
to
facilitate
the
--
that
in
the
transition
between
my
portion
of
the
argument
and
mr.
youngdahl's.
i
propose
to
give
some
maximum
of
25
minutes
this
afternoon,
perhaps
even
less
and
confine
my
remarks
to
the
facts
of
this
case
that
established
principle
as
we
see
it
for
the
favored
status
of
police
power
of
law
and
also
to
treaty
in
conclusion,
the
expressed
limitation
or
the
arbitration
award
and
the
alternative
argument
that
if
public
law
88-108
did
supersede
the
state
statutes,
if
those
state
statutes
are
revived
at
the
conclusion
or
duration
of
the
national
award.
my
colleague,
mr.
youngdahl,
representing
the
brotherhoods
in
the
case
number
69
then
used
the
remaining
portion
of
the
time
for
his
argument
in
chief
and
also
rebuttal.
i
understand
that
he
will
address
himself
particularly
to
the
contention
of
the
brotherhood
and
also
the
state
by
the
way
that
public
law
88-108
does
not
impair
any
of
the
full-crew
statutes
nor
has
any
other
legislation.
and
i
understand
that
mr.
youngdahl
will
develop
considerable
attention
in
doing
that
portion
of
the
argument
to
legislative
history
in
certain
concepts
that
he
will
offer.
finally,
mr.
youngdahl
will
conclude
this
portion
of
the
argument
on
the
pros
--
proposition,
if
there
is
no
justifiable
inference
in
this
record
to
merit
judicial
consideration
of
the
efficacies
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
full-crew
statutes.
inevitably,
we
suspect
there
will
be
some
overlapping
but
we've
given
this
as
a
guide
to
benefit
ourselves
and
the
court
and
also
the
appellees
in
the
case.
i
wish
to
deal
first
very
briefly
with
the
facts
and
the
history
of
this
litigation
and
the
apparent
conflict
of
laws
that
has
arisen.
the
two
arkansas
statutes
that
are
challenged
here
and
were
determined
to
be
preempted
by
the
district
court
are
act
116
of
1907
and
act
67
of
1913,
both
these
being
arkansas
statutes.
act
116
requires
in
essence
the
freight
trains
consisting
of
over
25
cars
operated
in
arkansas
on
a
line
that
has
over
50
miles
of
trackage
in
the
state,
must
have
a
crew
of
an
engineer,
a
fireman,
a
conductor,
and
three
freight
men.
similarly,
act
67
which
is
in
exception
also
requires
at
any
railroad
that
operates
more
than
a
100
miles
of
trackage
within
the
state
should
not
switch
or
transport
cars
at
public
crossings
in
cities
of
either
first
or
second
class
with
less
than
an
engineer,
a
fireman,
a
foreman,
and
three
helpers.
the
third
statute
which
perpendicularly
is
not
an
issue
here
and
i
think
that
of
itself
is
a
--
some
significance,
is
the
order
of
the
three
statutes,
act
298
of
1909
references
mentioned,
yes,
in
the
briefs,
and
that
statute
provide
for
a
minimum
crew
on
passenger
trains.
there
are
at
this
time
to
my
best
account
approximately
nine
states
in
the
union
that
have
that
full-crew
requirements
of
varying
sorts.
i
dare
say
that
in
addition
to
those
nine
states,
there
are
still
some
other
states
i
become
aware
of
that
have
given
authority
to
commissions
or
other
regulatory
bodies
to
establish
for
the
amount
to
full-crew
requirements.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
believe
there
are
about
nine.
apparently,
there's
even
a
controversy
there
mr.
chief
justice.
i
referred
at
one
time
--
point
to
perhaps
a
dozen.
i
notice
the
appellees
refer
to
seven
and
i
know
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
well,
there
was
a
reason
to
compromise,
i
start
the
argument
with.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
might
add
that
in
north
dakota
that
--
i
believe
that
the
last
general
election,
the
people
on
a
referendum
abolished
their
full-crew
laws
but
the
attorney
general
of
north
dakota
advises
me
that
there
are
some
concepts
of
that
law
that
they
believe
are
still
enforceable
and
they
maintain
that
they
did
still
have
some
attitude
of
full-crew
requirement
even
in
that
state.
so,
i
suppose
it
would
not
be
an
overstatement
to
offer
at
this
point
that
the
status
in
effect
of
full-crews
throughout
the
united
states
is
in
a
fairly
definite
status
of
chaos.
something
must
now
be
said
of
the
advance
leading
to
the
presentation
in
enactment
of
public
law
88-108.
on
july
22,
1963,
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
an
address
to
the
congress
remarked
that
there
had
been
three
and
one-half
years
of
constant
fruitless
attempts
to
achieve
peaceful
settlement
between
the
carriers
and
unions
of
certain
proposed
work
rule
of
changes.
i
believe
that
this
was
primarily
directed
at
a
fireman
issue.
he
recited
some
of
those
efforts
made
in
the
past
to
resolve
this
conflict
and
then
recommended
in
the
form
of
proposed
legislation
that
notices
be
directed
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
some
sort
of
interim
resolution.
now,
the
act
finally
passed
by
the
congress
which
i
referred
to
before
public
law
88-108,
did
not
follow
completely
to
suggest
another
precedent.
and
that
substituted
in
place
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
was
the
creation
of
an
arbitration
board
and
the
requirement
of
compulsory
arbitration
between
the
parties
that
consisted
of
these
operating
railroad
unions
and
certain
carriers.
it
was
provided
in
public
law
88-108
that
the
award
was
to
expire
within
two
years.
after
the
award
was
made,
special
provisions
were
promulgated
by
special
boards
of
adjustment
that
were
created
across
the
nation.
the
award
was
found
as
directed
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
thereafter,
did
result
in
legis
--
litigation
involving
the
brotherhoods
and
these
certain
carriers.
judge
hollzer,
the
hearing
judge
declared,
that
this
award
was
binding
on
the
brotherhoods
and
the
carriers.
the
brotherhoods
appeal
that
decision
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
decision
was
affirmed
2
to
1,
i
believe
the
chief
judge
dissenting.
in
reference
to
our
particular
litigation,
in
april
1964,
the
six
large
interstate
railroads
filed
a
complaint
to
the
district
court
of
arkansas
against
the
two
prosecuting
attorneys.
within
whose
districts
at
these
railroads
operating,
i'm
sure
the
complaints
fixed
better
than
i
have
but
just
in
passing
reference,
the
allegations
contained
in
the
complaint
were
the
statutes
of
arkansas
where
an
improper
regulation
of
commerce
constitute
a
deprivation
of
property
for
that
due
process
of
law,
denied
the
railroad's
equal
protection
and
finally,
that
the
state
laws
had
been
preempted
by
the
enactment
of
public
law
88-108.
they
further
asked
that
the
arkansas
statutes
be
declared
invalid
and
that
the
prosecuting
attorneys
be
enjoined
from
enforcement
of
its
provisions.
and
this
--
motion
was
made
by
the
operating
brotherhoods
to
intervene,
it
was
granted,
they
promptly
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
is
--
was
promptly
denied.
then
thereafter,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed
by
the
railroads
containing
much
the
similar
prayer
but
more
particularly
relying
upon
preemption
of
the
award
made
under
public
law
88-108.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
do
not
--
it
has
been
suggested
--
some
thought
has
been
given
to
it.
i
think
perhaps
there
was
some
offer
made
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
even
in
the
interstate
carriers'
case.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
be
glad
to
do
so,
sir.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
the
issue
was
then
submitted
on
summary
judgment
to
the
three-judge
court
and
at
that
time,
to
the
district
judges,
found
in
favor
of
preemption,
the
circuit
judge
dissenting.
although,
it
has
no
place
as
to
the
actual
merits
or
consideration
of
this
cause,
i
think
it
is
remarkable
that
in
terms
of
dollars
of
annual
salaries
in
arkansas,
this
suit
involves
perhaps
over
$6
million
in
effects
near
a
thousand
employees
nationally,
best
guesses
are
that
full-crew
laws
account
for
perhaps
$75
million
each
year
in
paid
wages.
i
have
not
attempted
to
compute
the
number
of
jobs
that
might
be
lost
but
at
stake
and
most
important
to
the
state
of
arkansas
and
to
each
of
the
several
other
states
is
the
question
of
inherent
right
of
police
power
to
exercise
authority
and
what
we'd
believe
to
be
a
very
basic
and
fundamental
obligation
of
the
state
to
its
citizens.
with
that
brief
introduction,
i
do
want
to
proceed
then
to
discuss
--
pardon
me,
to
discuss
the
initial
topic
and
that
is
the
police
power
authority.i
believe
to
assure
proper
perspective
in
this
cause
it
is
necessary
that
some
firm
basis
be
described
on
which
this
litigation
may
be
considered.
it
cannot
be
forgotten
but
should
be
kept
foremost
that
the
two
arkansas
statutes
challenged
here
this
afternoon
and
ruled
invalid
by
the
court
below
bare
this
court
to
prior
judicial
approval.
act
--
first
act,
act
67
was
determined
to
be
valid
under
attacked,
no
similar
of
those
here
in
1911.
act
116,
and
may
have
those
reversed,
also
survived
a
similar
attack
in
the
case
of
st.
louis
iron
mountain
and
southern
railway
in
1916
before
this
court.
most
significantly,
both
of
these
statutes
again
survived
identical
contetion
--
contentions
of
deprivation
and
discrimination.
and
in
addition
to
that,
to
be
preempted
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
late
as
1931
in
this
court
rendered
its
decision
of
missouri
pacific
versus
norwood
which
incidentally
was
the
attorney
general
at
that
time.
now,
these
statutes
have
as
their
vitality,
the
function
of
operating
in
behalf
not
only
the
welfare
and
safety
of
the
railroad
employees
but
more
importantly
in
behalf
of
the
traveling
public
and
the
general
community
as
well.
and
this
has
been
so
often
repeated
that
hardly
requires
reiteration
in
my
part.
but
in
view
of
the
--
taken
by
the
appellees
that
their
brief
is
so
easily
and
carelessly
described,
the
arkansas
statutes
as
having
the
sole
benefit
of
providing
jobs.
i
do
think
it's
necessary
to
make
some
sort
of
comment.
indeed,
the
appellees
and
i
believe
it
was
in
the
one
the
amica
briefs,
made
the
statement
that
the
statutes
have
no
relation
to
safety
at
all.
now,
in
this
regard,
it
would
appear
in
due
of
attack
employed
before
the
district
court
by
proceeding
by
summary
judgment
in
evading,
thus
evading
a
trial
on
the
merits
which
had
benefited
in
some
sort
of
conclusion
of
the
actual
relationship
of
these
statutes
to
safety.
that
the
appellees
have
forfeited
this
right
to
actually
complain
of
whether
not
these
state
statutes
have
as
their
basis
any
matter
of
public
safety.
i
think
this
is
true
to
the
matter
of
law.
now,
on
basis
of
this
appeal,
i
think
that
there
is
the
continuing
presumption
as
there
has
been
since
1911
that
the
arkansas
statutes
are
reasonable,
that
they
are
just
and
they
are
dedicated
to
the
end
of
providing
safety
for
the
benefit
and
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
state
of
arkansas.
at
least,
this
concept
we
keep
consistent
with
the
concession
made
by
the
appellees
that
full-crew
statutes
in
regard
to
passenger
trains
are
desirable,
they
have
not
been
attacked.
in
the
connection
also,
it
may
be
conceded
that
congress
could
have
in
its
discretion
exercised
complete
dominion
over
the
field
of
interstate
railroads
and
crew
concepts.
i
think
all
the
parties
are
agreed
on
that
point.
the
congress
and
the
opinion
of
the
appellants,
has
failed
to
exercise
his
authority
and
the
courts
have
consistently
adhered
to
the
concept
of
refraining
from
seeking
a
conflict
of
state
and
federal
laws
unless
compelled
by
the
circumstances
which
demand
preemption.
i
hope
that
this
very
brief
of
almost
perfunctory
treatment,
if
i
may,
will
not
be
leveled
the
magnitude
of
these
issues.
i
want
to
abandon
it
now
and
proceed
to
the
discussion
to
the
final
proposition.
that
is
the
point
of
revival
of
state
statutes.
at
topic
three
of
the
appellate's
brief
there's
offered
an
alternative
type
of
argument
that
should
this
court
determine
that
public
law
88-108
and
the
award
made
there
under,
it
must
be
preempted
--
excuse
me,
must
preempt
state
crew
laws,
then
we
urge
that
the
district
court's
judgment
holding
that
these
laws
will
not
be
not
revived
at
the
termination
of
the
award,
we
hope
--
we
urge
that
that
be
reversed.
now,
we
base
this
argument
upon
two
main
principles.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
it's
our
contention,
mr.
justice
white,
that
by
the
expressed
language
of
section
4
in
public
law
88-108,
i'm
not
positive
of
it
but
i
think
and
it
was
in
essence
that
this
award
shall
terminate
within
two
years.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
that
this
must
be
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
that
initially,
i'll
have
to
start
from
the
basis
that
we
think
as
our
contention
that
the
award
will
terminate
that
its
--
by
its
own
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
that
either
in
january
or
in
march
that
these
will
terminate.
i
frankly
concede
that
this
appears
to
be
a
rather
an
emic
contention
but
particularly
when
confronted
by
the
response
of
the
railroads
that
huge
sums
of
money
have
been
paid
and
employees
discharged.
but
i
think
there
are
number
of
reasons
why
we
should
not
and
the
court
ought
not
to
be
concerned
with
what
will
happen
in
those
case
--
states.
first,
surely,
notices
will
be
served
prior
to
the
expiration
of
their
award.
i
don't
believe
that
the
railroad
seriously
believed
that
there
will
evade
the
collective
bargaining
table
forever
in
the
future.
secondly,
i
think
this
is
another
issue
which
i
hate
to
speculate
or
has
it
i
guess
but
i
don't
believe
that
anyone
seriously
believes
that
in
view
of
the
reason
advanced
that
the
brotherhood
will
demand
and
receive
the
status
of
crew
compliment
comparable
to
what
they
had
in
1963.
i
think
that
public
law
88-108
and
the
history
and
mr.
youngdahl
will
treat
that
more
appropriately
confirms
the
fact
that
this
was
only
stopped
or
an
interim
type
of
solution
to
an
age-old
problem
that
once
the
parties
had
reached
some
sort
of
plateau,
even
through
compulsory
arbitration,
that
they
would
be
permitted
then
in
the
future
to
bargain
collectively,
to
use
the
powers
economically
that
are
--
are
available
to
them.
and
i
don't
foresee,
and
it
is
conjectural
on
my
part,
that
after
the
efforts
of
the
board
in
this
litigation
and
the
judicial
consideration,
that
we're
going
to
be
back
in
those
states
where
there
are
not
full-crew
statutes
with
a
fireman's
helper,
three
brakemen
on
the
train.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
would
think
that
if
the
parties
have
not
agreed
upon
anything,
that
it
would
be
a
matter
which
would
then
address
itself
to
the
president
or
to
the
congress
to
take
such
further
action
that
may
be
necessary.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
so.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
would
say
that
--
that
the
award
makes
particular
reference
to
those
terms
of
that
language
which
were
quoted
in
our
brief.
but
that
until
that
the
parties
consisting
of
the
carriers
and
the
brotherhoods
reach
an
agreement
is
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining
between
those
parties
alone
and
would
not
involve
state
or
state
statutes
and
if
i
may,
in
conclusion,
make
some
reference
to
our
feeling
at
what
ought
to
be
the
operation
of
this
law
in
states
that
have
full-crew
laws.
we
believe
that
it
is
inconceivable
or
rather
inconceivable
that
the
congress
would
make
such
a
definitive
duration
of
a
award
for
two
years
and
require
that
the
railroads
expend
large
sums
of
money
or
discharged
employees
or
give
them
enabled
transfers
and
then
put
them
back
in
the
position
of
status
quo.
and
we
think
that
perhaps
the
best
answer
to
this
argument
and
the
only
logical
one,
is
that
congress
in
the
first
place
did
not
obtain
for
the
award
to
act
in
this
area
of
full-crew
states.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
and
in
this
connection,
as
far
as
i'm
informed,
there
has
been
no
operation
on
the
arbitration
of
award
in
arkansas
and
i
do
not
believe
in
any
other
states.
and
i
believe,
that
the
contentions
of
the
railroads
that
millions
of
dollars
has
been
spent
is
not
near
so
better
appeal,
as
has
been
suggested.
and
i
think
that
perhaps
that
the
vi
--
does
not
been
so
drastic
that
there
has
been
compliance
and
that
there
will
be
no
disruption
of
facilities
or
money
spent
or
reduction
in
employees
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
have
conferred
with
a
number
of
attorney
generals
over
the
united
states
and
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
railroad
brotherhoods
in
operating
in
--
throughout
the
various
states
and
i'm
--
it's
my
best
information
that
there
has
not
been
reduction
of
crews
that's
--
in
those
states
that
still
have
an
active
full-crew
laws,
it's
not
been
dissolved
or
would
have
bound
by
some
decision.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i'll
refer
to
mr.
youngdahl.
