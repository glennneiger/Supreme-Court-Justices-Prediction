and
that
was
always
subject
to
state
full-crew
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
couldn't
go
to
anything
that
displays
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sorry,
mr.
youngdahl,
where
in
your
appendix
c
is
that?
is
it
in
your
appendix?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
don't
bother.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
followed
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
the
discrimination
argument
you're
urging
as
to
independent
ground
for
striking
down
these
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
spectrum
of
the
resolution
of
preemption,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
so
mr.
light,
i
take
it
if
--
i
think
you've
already
said
that
against
all
that
background,
congress
nevertheless
might
have
meant,
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
find
out
here,
isn't
it?
and
might
have
said
so
explicit
against
all
these
background
nevertheless
this
legislation
does
not
preempt
to
displace
state
full-crew
law,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice

(voice

on
the
statement
in
the
house
report,
the
committee
does
not
intend,
the
committee
does
not
intend
that
any
award.
they
supersede
or
modify
any
state
law
relating
to
the
manning
of
trains.
when
the
house
after
this
debate
in
which
congressman
smith
became
involved
knowing
that
its
committee
wanted
this
statute
to
be
read
as
not
superseding
any
state
full-crew
law,
approved
the
legislation
without
understanding,
doesn't
it
adopt,
at
least
the
house
adopt
its
committee
meaning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
we
have
had
a
case
exactly
like
this
but
the
principle
is
whether
or
not
congress
matter
did
not
mean
in
what
the
legislative
record
shows
as
to
that
meaning
to
supersede
state
laws,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
he
did
not
but
it
was
the
house's
committee
and
they
came
in
and
say
to
their
fellow
members,
“we
do
not
mean
this
to
supersede
the
state
full-crew
laws.”
and
knowing
that
that's
what
they
meant
because
that's
what
they
said
they
meant
by
the
legislation
which
the
committee
had
drafted.
and
the
house
then
adopts
it,
doesn't
it
carry
with
it
that
expression
of
intent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
not
for
the
senate
but,
i
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
difficulty
seeing
why
it
wouldn't
for
the
house?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
congress
doesn't
often
help
us
out
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
one
way
or
another
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
finally
and
briefly
discuss
and
i
think
it
requires
only
a
brief
discussion
on
a
very
serious
contention
sir,
from
the
part
from
preemption
that
these
laws
do
amount
to
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
favoring
thereby
intrastate
commerce.
in
arkansas,
there
are
17
intrastate
railroads
operating
exclusively
within
the
state.
these
laws
by
virtue
of
the
50-mile
and
100-mile
exemptions
exempt
all
17
from
the
burdens
of
both
laws.
on
the
other
hand,
the
1907
statute
with
the
50-mile
exemption
applies
to
10
of
the
11
interstate
railroads
operating
across
arkansas.
the
1913
act
applies
to
eight
of
the
11.
it's
put
in
better
perspective
as
to
the
real
impact
on
the
interstate
commerce
is
distinguished
from
intrastate
commerce
when
it's
exempt
--
examined
the
impact
to
these
statutes
is
examined
in
light
of
the
interstate
railroad
truckage
in
arkansas
to
which
it
applies.
in
both
instances,
each
statute
applies
to
well
over
99%
of
the
interstate
railroad
truckage
operated
in
arkansas
whereas
it
applies
to
zero
percent
of
the
railroad
truckage
of
the
intrastate
railroads.
it
seems
to
be
the
settle
rule
that
while
a
state
can
burden
commerce
to
a
certain
extent
if
it
does
it
reasonably
and
the
test
is
measuring
on
the
one
hand
the
local
interest
against
the
national
interest
on
--
of
an
unfettered
transportation
system
and
unfettered
interstate
commerce.
the
corollary
of
the
rule
is
that
a
state
cannot
burden
commerce,
it
can't
direct
the
burden
against
commerce
thereby
favoring
or
against
intrastate
commerce
thereby
favoring
its
local
interest
and
giving
it
a
competitive
advantage.
our
adversaries
don't
really
seek
to
answer
this
argument,
they
did
not
seek
that
--
answer
it
before
the
bar,
this
court,
the
only
suggestion
contained
in
their
briefs
is
that
this
might
be
something
that
the
district
court
could
take
some
proof
on
to
see
what
the
effect
to
these
statutes
are
on
interstate
commerce.
if
this
were
an
undue
burden
argument,
certainly
that
would
be
right,
it
takes
extensive
proof
to
make
that
sort
of
weighing
but
this
is
discrimination
which
this
court
had
said
is
absolutely
forbidden.
and
the
only
relevant
proof
that
can
be
made
is
in
this
record
and
it
is
undisputed
and
that
is
that
the
discrimination
is
there,
it
falls
only
on
the
interstate
railroads.
and
perhaps
to
add
a
little
bit
to
it,
i
don't
that
it
is
essential
that
the
discrimination
is
really
a
significant
that
the
impact
is
significant
and
the
cause
of
compliance
that's
contained
and
is
undisputed
in
this
record,
proves
that
this
is
something
that
costs
$6
million
to
$8
million
a
year
to
these
railroads
just
to
comply
of
these
statutes
that
fall
on
the
interstate
railroads
alone.
thank
you
your
honor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
very
clear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
mean
the
award
shall
continue
--
enforce
for
such
a
period
the
board
shall
determine
in
its
award
but
not
to
exceed
two
years
and
that
they've
--
the
award
takes
effect
unless
the
parties
agree
otherwise.
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
whole
thing
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
didn't
see
it
that
way
mr.
lyons,
what
the
--
and
this
whole
thing
goes
out
on
march
31.
what
then
of
the
argument
under
supersession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
that
carry
so
far
as
to
say
that
in
1967,
a
state
which
has
no
full-crew
law
could
not
effectively
adopt
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
awards
out
the
window
and
this
federal
statute
is
off
the
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we've
never
had
a
situation
quite
like
this
have
we
in
this
area
of
preemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
didn't
had
those
words
your
honor
but
if
we
went
back
in
1966
if
congress
intended
that
the
parties
be
back
in
the
same
loggerheads
as
they
were
in
1963
that
the
parties
be
--
then
go
back
and
try
to
impose
a
fireman
in
all
these
diesels.
i
don't
think
that
would've
been
a
complete
and
final
disposition
of
the
issue.
and
then
congress
clearly
said
that
the
award
was
to
be
a
complete
and
final
disposition
of
the
issue.
the
way
in
which
you
can
--
one
can
put
those
two
commands
of
congress
together
is
to
hold
that
the
award
stands
in
effect
as
an
award
for
the
two-year
period
that
thereafter
the
parties
are
free
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
and
can
--
or
certainly
intended
that
they
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
and
try
and
settle
this
among
themselves
in
the
future
as
to
what
would
be
the
situation
thereafter.
but
you
get
into
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
say
that
the
existing
rules
which
govern
and
these
are
the
rules
of
the
award
continue
until
they
are
changed
in
the
manner
provided
in
the
act
and
that
of
course
is
the
essential
difference
between
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
finally,
as
to
that,
there
are
some
contention
that
because
of
the
emergency
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lyons,
what
--
in
substance,
is
position
this,
congress
took
this
difficult
problem
and
said,
“states
no
one
else
except
the
parties
really
are
to
resolve
it.
we'll
help
out
at
this
juncture
for
two
years
with
a
--
an
ad
hoc
arbitration
body
but
this
has
got
to
be
resolved
now
in
collective
bargaining.
we
will
give
them
two
years,
with
this
help
and
after
that,
they
do
it
themselves
and
everybody
else
stay
out
of
it",
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
the
fact
really
at
least
the
house
committee,
i
guess
said
it
is
clearly
as
they
could
that
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
why
would
they
have
said
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
had
been
the
overall
problem,
it
certainly
not
makes
sense,
is
this,
rather
bizarre
result
here.
i
must
agree
to
say
that
the
award
mean
--
is
meaningless
in
the
case
of
state
--
the
full-crew
laws
but
why
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
did
this
commitee
say
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
it
--
a
bizarre
result
is
only
to
the
state
for
full-crew
laws,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
eight
or
nine
or
whatever
the
number
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
the
number
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
the
--
in
many,
many
states
i
gather,
firemen
being
faced
out
under
the
award,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
but
it's
in
the
state
with
full-crew
laws
where
that
can't
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
about
--
is
this
an
argument
mr.
youngdahl
that
actually,
congress
knew
17,000
were
involved.
they
were
perfectly
willing
to
say
as
to
those
17,000
nothing
this
award
says
shall
have
an
impact
on
the
state
full-crew
laws
that
protect
those
17,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you
say
the
legislative
history
shows?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
who
else
made
the
--
in
the
testimony
besides
what
you
referred
as
to
the
railroad
setting?
did
the
brotherhoods
say
anything
along
these
lines?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
--
did
the
brotherhoods
offer
this
statistical
evidence
of
the
number
affected
by
full-crew
laws
frequent
down
by
states
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
of
that
kind
evidence
it
would?
