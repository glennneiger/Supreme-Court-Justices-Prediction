justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
by
the
same
token
would
the
ballots
have
to
be
in
both
languages?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
now
--
even
though
the
people
who
used
the
english
ballots
can't
read
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
constitutional
amendments?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they're
brief
alright
but
the
people
who
--
if
people
could
read
those
they
could
pass
an
english
language
literacy
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
think
that
if
you're
right
in
this
case,
that
new
york
would
have
to
have
ballots
printed
in
spanish?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
in
mexico?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
there
had
to
be
spanish
printed
ballots
why
it
really
means
of
paper
ballots
not
machine
voting,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
what
is
an
american
flag
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
--
justice
byron
r.
white
all
--
are
all
puerto
rican
schools
american
flag
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
--
i
gather
then,
you
would
think
that
reapportionment
cases
are
washington
monument
in
that
sense.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
carrington
and
rash
at
least
were
very
comparable.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
carrington
against
rash
to
be
very
comparable,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
carrington
against
rash
couldn't
be
supported
under
the
original
--
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
the
reapportionment
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
classic?
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
classic?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
of
those
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
other
rights
besides
political
rights
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
excludes.
how
about
economic
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
whole
view
of
why
they
chose
this
particular
form
or
words
to
get
across
this
idea?
justice
byron
r.
white
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
i
take
it
you
think
the
equal
protection
clause
that
were
only
placed
with
the
words
that
no
states
would
deny
any
christian
his
civil
rights
that
you'd
be
expressing
the
meaning
that
you
were
--
that
you
think
congress
intended.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
privileges
and
immunities
were
--
the
clause
was
replaced
by
civil
rights.
what
would
the
equal
protection
clause
according
to
your
interpretation
protect
in
addition
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
then
also
reject
the
state
--
the
congress'
power
in
a
due
process
clause
or
you
would
be
accepting
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
reject
in
validating
a
state
law
in
the
grounds
that
the
means
that
chose
to
accomplish
it
and
really
had
no
rational
basis
at
all.
there's
no
rational
connection
between
the
ends
and
the
means.
you
would
say
that
as
an
improper
application
of
due
process
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
original
understanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
due
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
so
if
you
--
so
what's
your
answer
if
you
decided
that
there
was
absolutely
no
connection
or
whatsoever
between
four
arm
strength
and
the
voting
and
therefore
no
connection
between
doing
push-ups
in
voting.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
still
wouldn't
say
that
that
law
of
hawaii
violated
the
due
process
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
validated
municipal
legislation
on
the
due
process
--
on
this
basis
under
the
due
process
clause
are
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
there
was,
you
would
say
it
wouldn't
apply
to
voting
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there
were,
you
would
say
it
wouldn't
apply
to
voting.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
voting
is
out
no
matter
what
you're
talking
about
due
process,
privileges
and
immunities,
or
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
(voice
overlap)
well
i
suppose
that
congress
said
that
“we're
here
enforcing
the
equal
protection
clause
and
we
decree
that
no
state
may
impose
any
age
qualifications
in
voting.”
that's
an
invidious
discrimination
between
the
old
and
the
young.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
cases
has
this
court
ever
set
to
congress
though?
your
determination,
this
law
is
invalid
because
your
determination,
what
have
not
to
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
valid.
civil
rights
cases
i
suppose
is
it
not

is

byron

another

that
generally
it

of
