mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
seek
to
try
to
avoid
any
repetition
of
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general.
but
i
would
like
to
indicate
to
you
the
great
interest
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
upholding
this
action
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
4
(e).
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
the
power
of
congress
to
act.
that
is
the
question
subject
to
inquiry.
we
find
ample
power
for
section
4
(e)
in
the
territorial
clause
alone.
we
find
ample
power
for
congress
to
act
in
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone.
we
find
ample
power
in
combination
of
those
two
provisions
to
our
constitution.
we
also
find
power
in
the
united
nation's
charter
article
55
and
the
adherence
of
the
united
states
to
that
treaty.
in
examining
this
question,
we
think
that
the
court
should
turn
to
try
to
determine
what
congress
was
doing,
whether
it
had
the
power
not
whether
it
was
justified
in
the
act
that
it
undertook.
the
wisdom,
the
soundness
of
the
judgment
in
passing
4
(e)
is
not
a
subject
that
this
court
will
examine.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
that
the
congress
was
relying
upon
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
if
it
found
that
that
particular
clause
of
the
constitution
did
not
sustain
the
act,
it
would
stop
there
under
its
decisions.
it
would
always
look
to
the
entire
framework
of
the
constitution
to
find
out
if
congress
had
the
power
any
place
within
that
framework
to
pass
this
law
as
a
part
of
its
legislative
function.
so
the
question
is
what
congress
was
doing
within
its
powers?
and
i
think
that
under
the
holdings
of
this
court,
the
congress
has
--
and
this
court
has
recognized,
a
peculiar
power
to
try
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
facts
and
the
responsibilities
that
it
should
exercise
in
the
legislative
process.
and
turning
to
that,
we
must
examine
the
problems
that
this
country
had,
that
puerto
rico
had,
that
new
york
and
new
york
city
had
in
connection
with
this
particular
matter.
those
were
the
things
that
congress
was
addressing
itself
to.
first,
puerto
rico
as
a
territory
was
the
ward
of
this
country.
this
court
has
recognized
as
has
the
congress
and
the
executive
of
this
government
that
there
is
a
peculiar
responsibility
to
such
wards.
the
united
states
tried
with
considerable
care
to
develop
the
system
of
education
that
would
incorporate
the
english
language
as
a
basic
tool
of
communication
for
these
people.
and
it
found
that
it
wouldn't
work.
it
found
in
fact
that
it
was
interfering
with
the
ability
of
these
people
to
learn.
and
it
was
only
after
repeated
attempts
of
that
kind
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
recognized
its
failure
and
decided
that
the
primary
consideration
for
these
people
was
to
aid
them
in
the
learning
that
was
necessary
to
be
good
citizens
of
puerto
rico
and
later
of
the
commonwealth
in
the
development
of
this
area
of
our
country.
and
therefore,
proceeding
upon
the
knowledge
that
congress
had
and
the
knowledge
that
it
gained
from
the
experience
that
it
went
through,
yet
finally
in
1946
abandoned
all
efforts
to
try
to
make
these
people
learn
english
as
the
basic
tool
of
communication
and
learning.
and
that
was
a
congressional
act
carefully
undertaken
in
the
light
of
very
difficult
experience
and
knowledge
of
failure.
now,
it
appears
to
us
that
congress
recognized
a
responsibility
in
passing
4
(e)
in
light
of
this
experience
and
history
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
seemed
to
me
(voice
overlap)
that
it
was
done
pursuant
to
the
abandonment
of
the
efforts
of
determining
who
the
secretary
or
the
person
in
charge
of
education
in
puerto
rico
would
be.
and
we
had
under
the
supervision
of
the
united
states
tried
to
have
that
appointment
made
by
the
executive
and
the
english
language
taught
over
a
considerable
term
i
think
from
1916
on.
and
as
i
recall
the
history,
we
even
got
to
the
place
where
the
commissioner
of
education
gave
up
and
resigned
because
of
the
complete
failure
of
the
program.
and
we
found
that
we
couldn't
even
get
people
to
hold
the
office
to
try
to
teach
these
people
and
develop
an
adequate
learning
system
and
educational
program
if
we
try
to
force
english
upon
them.
and
i
assume
although
i
can't
document
this,
that
they
had
to
deal
with
everything
around
them
in
their
life
that
was
denominated
and
had
spanish
names,
spanish
experience,
spanish
culture,
and
they
try
to
convert
that.
as
we
all
know,
the
process
of
translation
back
and
forth
is
a
difficult
one
for
all
us
from
one
language
to
another
while
if
you
can
think
on
the
language.
and
if
you
can
become
skilled
enough
even
in
the
foreign
language
to
think
in
it,
the
process
of
learning
is
much
easier.
now
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
from
the
government's
brief,
it
describes
the
fact
on
page
16,
the
difficulties
that
the
congress
had
with
the
whole
subject,
and
finally
concluded
that
it
should
abandon
the
efforts
to
try
to
teach
these
people
in
english,
and
wouldn't
allow
them
to
go
back
to
the
spanish
and
the
spanish
culture
as
their
basic
tool.
then
of
course
in
1917
with
the
jones
act,
the
congress
had
provided
for
these
people
to
have
citizenship
and
to
be
permitted
to
enter
the
united
states
like
any
other
citizen.
and
it
is
true
that
it
was
after
this
time
that
the
great
influx
of
puerto
ricans
came
into
new
york
and
particularly
new
york
city.
i
think
there
were
seven
or
8000
in
earlier
period
and
later
it
become
some
700
or
800,000.
i
want
to
stop
for
a
moment
where
the
court
make
a
claim
that
the
problem
is
not
that
large.
the
problem
is
something
like
8146,
i
think
who
registered
under
section
4
(e)
in
this
particular
matter
and
is
now
involved.
it
may
--
it
probably
is
little
larger
than
that
because
there
is
a
possibility
that
others
who
could
register
did
not
as
it
is
always
the
case.
i
think
that
factually
in
regard
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
treatment
of
spanish
speaking
people
within
the
new
york
area
is
one
factor
that
the
congress
seem
to
be
well
aware
of
in
connection
with
the
legislation
and
should
be
recognized,
i
think,
in
the
examination
of
the
question
by
this
court.
the
spanish
language
papers
make
a
very
complete
coverage
of
all
political
matters
in
the
area.
they
are
eager
to
cover
all
of
the
happenings
of
political
action
in
the
new
york
area
and
they
do.
they
also
cover
all
of
the
wire
services,
they
translate
them
into
spanish.
they
set
out
the
various
provisions
of
speeches
and
constitutional
amendments.
any
other
particular
political
action
in
spanish,
denominate
them
so
that
the
spanish
people
can
find
them
on
the
ballot.
and
there
is
no
question
about
these
people
being
able
to
make
an
intelligent
use
of
the
ballot
even
though
they
are
spanish
speaking.
therefore,
i
think
that
that
factor
is
one
that
is
important
for
this
court
to
consider
in
examining
whether
congress
have
the
power.
and
in
exercising
that
power,
whether
it
exercise
it
within
the
limits
of
what
congress
may
do
in
considering
whether
that
such
legislation
is
proper
to
preserve
the
franchise
for
this
substantial
group
of
people
who
have
been
and
are
the
wards
of
this
country
in
their
living
within
new
york
city.
now,
as
i
read
lassiter,
this
court
did
not
say
that
the
states
could
pass
any
kind
of
limiting
legislation
upon
the
franchise
as
far
as
qualification
of
voters
are
concerned.
this
court
was
addressing
itself,
as
i
see
lassiter,
to
the
basic
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
voter
could
exercise
an
intelligent
use
of
the
ballot.
and
this
court
has
addressed
itself
within
the
last
few
years
to
many
problems
in
this
field.
but
if
it
had
not
reach
that
point
earlier,
we
certainly
have
reached
the
point
today
where
we
recognize
that
one
of
the
greatest
rights
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
can
have
is
the
right
to
vote,
to
participate
in
a
genuine,
full,
and
complete
vote
on
matters,
issues,
and
persons
in
the
electoral
process.
so
in
light
of
that
and
the
gloss
that
it
presents,
i
think
that
lassiter
can
only
be
read
with
the
idea
and
the
concept
that
this
court
was
searching
to
find
whether
or
not
the
states
were
infringing
by
the
qualifications
they
imposed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
but
i
think
it
has
this
factor
that
of
whether
or
not,
this
court
was
recognizing
that
the
states
had
an
unlimited
power
to
impose
qualifications
upon
the
right
to
vote.
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that's
my
--
exactly
correct,
mr.
justice.
the
only
thing
i
was
trying
to
start
with
was
that
lassiter
does
not
prevent
the
congress
from
taking
this
action.
and
i
assume
that
that
would
be
conceded.
then
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
congress
had
the
power
to
take
this
action
under
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
and
we
find
that,
as
i
said,
in
the
territorial
clause
and
in
section
5
article
14.
now,
i
think
that
section
5,
this
court
has
recognized,
congress
has
a
peculiar
right
and
opportunity
to
assess
the
--
of
whether
or
not
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
being
infringed
upon.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice.
not
that
i
recall.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
i
think
that
they
carefully
examined
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
congress
in
saying
that
was
exercising
properly
or
within
the
range
of
its
full
powers,
its
authority
under
the
constitution
is
finally
for
this
court
to
determine.
but
i'm
trying
to
deal
with
the
standards
that
this
court
would
apply.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
applying
those
standards,
the
court
would
inquire,
well
did
congress
just
liberally
take
this
action
or
did
it
examine
the
various
factors
that
would
be
involved.
and
one
of
the
factors
that
seem
to
me,
that
the
congress
did
examine
carefully
was
whether
or
not
there
could
be
an
intelligent
exercise
of
the
function
of
the
elector
under
or
by
the
spanish
speaking
citizen,
under
the
law
as
it
was
being
passed
in
4
(e).
and
whether
that
person,
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
spanish
speaking,
could
be
under
the
circumstances
that
congress
reviewed
anew
existed
in
new
york,
could
be
an
intelligent
voter
in
the
process.
and
therefore,
should
have
some
action
taken
because
of
that
and
also
because
the
gloss
of
the
experience
of
the
united
states
in
connection
with
puerto
rico
over
the
years.
and
the
further
fact
that
we
were
responsible
in
a
substantial
measure
for
the
fact
that
these
people
found
themselves
in
the
position
that
they
were
in
about
their
educational
process
concerning
the
spanish
language.
and
in
light
of
all
of
those
things,
whether
or
not,
congress
in
deciding
under
section
5,
that
this
law
should
be
passed
to
implement
and
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
was
justified
at
all
in
any
way
under
the
constitution
in
taking
such
action,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
basic
test.
and
congress
having
taken
that
action,
and
in
light
of
all
of
the
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
then
the
court
addressed
itself,
is
there
any
way
that
we
can
find
under
the
whole
constitution,
under
this
provision,
that
congress
was
in
fact
justified
or
if
it
wasn't
justified
--
i
don't
think
justified
is
even
the
proper
measure.
could
congress,
under
the
constitution,
make
a
determination
that
this
was
a
proper
exercise
of
section
5
power
to
implement
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
equal
protection?
and
if
there's
any
way
that
this
court
can
find
that
congress
had
such
a
power
even
though
this
court
would
decide,
we
certainly
wouldn't
do
that.
we
would
say
that
everyone
in
the
united
states
before
you
can
vote
has
to
be
able
to
speak
english.
that
is
not
the
test
and
this
court
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
if
you
assume
the
history
that
congress
was
dealing
with
here,
that
there'd
be
no
question
of
its
power
to
pass
4
(e)
in
regard
to
puerto
ricans
who
were
members
of
an
independent
or
members
of
the
state
of
the
union.
they
could
certainly
take
that
action
to
provide
adequately,
assuming
the
standard
is
what
are
the
qualifications
that
can
be
imposed
upon
a
voter?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
would
say
that
as
a
commonwealth
or
when
it
was
a
territory
that
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
under
the
constitution
to
them
was
even
greater
because
at
that
point
they
were
and
our
wards.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
only
in
this
respect
that
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
regard
to
its
wards
in
the
territories,
that
it
--
the
united
states
has
had
a
special
obligation
to
care
for
them
because
they
didn't
--
the
people
didn't
know
these
territories,
did
not
have
the
same
kind
of
rights
that
people
in
the
states
have
in
the
conduct
of
their
own
affairs.
now,
as
the
common
--
under
the
commonwealth,
the
relationship
was
changed
and
there
is
no
question
to
what
puerto
rico
has
the
absolute
right
depending
upon
the
examination
by
the
present
commission
of
the
full
extent
of
what
was
done
by
that
relationship.
but
generally,
as
to
its
internal
affairs,
that
was
what
that
arrangement
in
1958,
as
i
recall
the
date,
was
to
try
to
accomplish,
was
to
give
it
to
control
of
its
internal
affairs
so
it
could
advance
them
and
develop
in
the
remarkable
manner
that
it
has.
but
it
seems
to
me
this
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
that
the
united
states
does
have
a
special
obligation
in
regard
to
territories
that
he
has
taken
over
and
has
found
people
there
as
its
wards,
and
that's
the
only
distinction
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
question
about
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
i
think
there's
no
question
about
congress
having
such
power.
i
think
that
it
can
proceed
to
legislate,
to
provide
and
take
care
of
that
kind
of
a
situation.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
a
much
easier
one
then
that
because
of
the
situation
where
you
have
a
history
of
the
language
and
you
have
a
history
of
the
congress
examining
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
people
could
be
intelligent
voters
despite
the
language
difference.
and
of
course
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
it
is
the
same
standards,
that
is
six
years
of
schooling
that
is
set
forth
for
4
(e).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
recollection,
mr.
justice.
there
was
none.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
haven't
made
a
careful
enough
study
of
the
--
that
act
to
know
what
the
government's
brief
does
not
indicate
that
any
other
part
of
it
was
grounded
upon
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
my
recollection
in
the
newspaper
counts
that
was
all
that
i
would
thought.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
south
carolina.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
stand
before
you
and
urge
you
to
consider
that
legislation
being
constitutionally
valid.
if
you
could
find
any
place
within
the
constitution,
you
know
the
congress
have
decided
only
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i'm
sorry
i
can't
be
more
precise
about
my
answer
but
i
think
that
you're
entirely
correct
from
my
general
recollection
that
i
have
examined
carefully.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
find
no
such
limitation
in
the
clause
and
i
don't
find
that
this
court
has
ever
said
that
it
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
not
that
i
know
of.
i
don't
know
whether
the
philippine
case
could
in
anyway
shed
any
light
on
that
or
not.
if
you
recall
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
after
it
became
independent,
the
persons
who
are
then
within
the
country
had
become
aliens.
but
i
don't
believe
that
involved
precisely.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice,
i
--(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
this
court
would
examine
whatever
congress
undertook
to
do,
give
great
consideration
to
whether
there's
any
justification
or
any
power
on
which
the
congress
could
rely
and
would
try
to
determine
whether
it
was
properly
or
it
was
trying
to
carry
out
some
responsibility
toward
that
territory.
and
i
think
against
that,
it
would
have
to
weigh
whether
it
was
just
wiping
out
the
proper
area
of
the
states
to
act
to
try
to
continue
and
develop
as
states
of
the
union.
i
think
it
would
be
that
kind
of
a
problem
but
i
don't
say
that
you
could
just
--
but
i
think
that's
quite
a
different
case
than
this.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
i
arrived
at
that
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
has
reached
the
place
where
it
recognizes
qualifications
of
voters
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
right
to
vote
is
so
precious
under
our
constitutional
system,
that
such
qualifications
cannot
be
made
unless
they
fairly
contribute
to
an
intelligent
exercise
of
the
ballot
of
the
electoral
process.
and
at
any
time
that
the
states
depart
from
that
kind
of
a
standard,
it
would
not
be
recognized
by
this
court
as
a
valid
exercise
of
their
function
in
fixing
qualifications.
that
they
are
not
free
to
just
say,
“we
shall
composed
certain
qualifications
on
the
right
to
exercise
the
franchise.”
that
day
has
passed,
if
it
ever
existed.
and
we
have
reached
the
point
where
those
qualifications
are
to
reach
the
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
this
person
can
exercise
the
franchise
intelligently
and
properly
so
thus
to
advance
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
government
generally.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
of
recognition
that
there
is
more
to
section
5
than
is
found
in
section
1.
and
that
the
congress
and
the
country
in
adopting
the
amendment
intended
that
there'd
be
more.
and
i
think
that
adds
to
the
--
what
you
can
find
to
support
the
action
of
congress.
i
just
like
briefly
to
say
that
i
think
in
article
55
of
the
united
nation
charter,
there
is
further
ground
in
the
treaty
power
of
the
united
states
to
support
this
action
of
the
congress
in
trying
to
carry
out
the
obligations
that
the
united
states
took
upon
itself
in
connection
with
that
entire
program
under
that
charter.
and
furthermore
in
our
representing
to
the
united
nations
in
order
to
induce
it
to
accept
the
fact
that
puerto
rico
had
different
status
than
mandated
or
other
special
colonial
or
that
type
of
relationships
when
we
represented
to
them
that
puerto
rico
was
a
commonwealth
and
that
we
would
conduct
our
relationships
in
accordance
with
that
standard
and
that
agreement.
and
therefore,
the
united
nations
proceeded
to
decide
that
it
was
not
in
a
character
of
other
country's
territories
that
were
subject
to
its
other
provisions.
and
under
that
treaty
power,
the
united
states
did
take
this
action.
it
presented
it
to
the
united
nations
and
upon
that
ground,
the
united
nations
acted
and
we
think
it
recognized
an
obligation
there
to
try
to
carry
out
the
fact
that
it
had
agreed
under
article
5
not
to
discriminate
against
people
because
of
the
language
they
used.
therefore,
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
ample
ground
on
the
three
provisions
of
the
constitution
that
i've
suggested.
the
court
will
look
at
the
entire
constitution
with
all
of
the
amendments,
find
the
power
that
congress
had
the
power
that
the
only
issue
here
and
it
is
one
more
step
in
our
trying
to
help
people
of
this
country
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process
where
their
greatest
rights
lie.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
seek
to
try
to
avoid
any
repetition
of
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general.
but
i
would
like
to
indicate
to
you
the
great
interest
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
upholding
this
action
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
4
(e).
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
the
power
of
congress
to
act.
that
is
the
question
subject
to
inquiry.
we
find
ample
power
for
section
4
(e)
in
the
territorial
clause
alone.
we
find
ample
power
for
congress
to
act
in
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
alone.
we
find
ample
power
in
combination
of
those
two
provisions
to
our
constitution.
we
also
find
power
in
the
united
nation's
charter
article
55
and
the
adherence
of
the
united
states
to
that
treaty.
in
examining
this
question,
we
think
that
the
court
should
turn
to
try
to
determine
what
congress
was
doing,
whether
it
had
the
power
not
whether
it
was
justified
in
the
act
that
it
undertook.
the
wisdom,
the
soundness
of
the
judgment
in
passing
4
(e)
is
not
a
subject
that
this
court
will
examine.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
that
the
congress
was
relying
upon
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
if
it
found
that
that
particular
clause
of
the
constitution
did
not
sustain
the
act,
it
would
stop
there
under
its
decisions.
it
would
always
look
to
the
entire
framework
of
the
constitution
to
find
out
if
congress
had
the
power
any
place
within
that
framework
to
pass
this
law
as
a
part
of
its
legislative
function.
so
the
question
is
what
congress
was
doing
within
its
powers?
and
i
think
that
under
the
holdings
of
this
court,
the
congress
has
--
and
this
court
has
recognized,
a
peculiar
power
to
try
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
facts
and
the
responsibilities
that
it
should
exercise
in
the
legislative
process.
and
turning
to
that,
we
must
examine
the
problems
that
this
country
had,
that
puerto
rico
had,
that
new
york
and
new
york
city
had
in
connection
with
this
particular
matter.
those
were
the
things
that
congress
was
addressing
itself
to.
first,
puerto
rico
as
a
territory
was
the
ward
of
this
country.
this
court
has
recognized
as
has
the
congress
and
the
executive
of
this
government
that
there
is
a
peculiar
responsibility
to
such
wards.
the
united
states
tried
with
considerable
care
to
develop
the
system
of
education
that
would
incorporate
the
english
language
as
a
basic
tool
of
communication
for
these
people.
and
it
found
that
it
wouldn't
work.
it
found
in
fact
that
it
was
interfering
with
the
ability
of
these
people
to
learn.
and
it
was
only
after
repeated
attempts
of
that
kind
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
recognized
its
failure
and
decided
that
the
primary
consideration
for
these
people
was
to
aid
them
in
the
learning
that
was
necessary
to
be
good
citizens
of
puerto
rico
and
later
of
the
commonwealth
in
the
development
of
this
area
of
our
country.
and
therefore,
proceeding
upon
the
knowledge
that
congress
had
and
the
knowledge
that
it
gained
from
the
experience
that
it
went
through,
yet
finally
in
1946
abandoned
all
efforts
to
try
to
make
these
people
learn
english
as
the
basic
tool
of
communication
and
learning.
and
that
was
a
congressional
act
carefully
undertaken
in
the
light
of
very
difficult
experience
and
knowledge
of
failure.
now,
it
appears
to
us
that
congress
recognized
a
responsibility
in
passing
4
(e)
in
light
of
this
experience
and
history
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
seemed
to
me
(voice
overlap)
that
it
was
done
pursuant
to
the
abandonment
of
the
efforts
of
determining
who
the
secretary
or
the
person
in
charge
of
education
in
puerto
rico
would
be.
and
we
had
under
the
supervision
of
the
united
states
tried
to
have
that
appointment
made
by
the
executive
and
the
english
language
taught
over
a
considerable
term
i
think
from
1916
on.
and
as
i
recall
the
history,
we
even
got
to
the
place
where
the
commissioner
of
education
gave
up
and
resigned
because
of
the
complete
failure
of
the
program.
and
we
found
that
we
couldn't
even
get
people
to
hold
the
office
to
try
to
teach
these
people
and
develop
an
adequate
learning
system
and
educational
program
if
we
try
to
force
english
upon
them.
and
i
assume
although
i
can't
document
this,
that
they
had
to
deal
with
everything
around
them
in
their
life
that
was
denominated
and
had
spanish
names,
spanish
experience,
spanish
culture,
and
they
try
to
convert
that.
as
we
all
know,
the
process
of
translation
back
and
forth
is
a
difficult
one
for
all
us
from
one
language
to
another
while
if
you
can
think
on
the
language.
and
if
you
can
become
skilled
enough
even
in
the
foreign
language
to
think
in
it,
the
process
of
learning
is
much
easier.
now
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
from
the
government's
brief,
it
describes
the
fact
on
page
16,
the
difficulties
that
the
congress
had
with
the
whole
subject,
and
finally
concluded
that
it
should
abandon
the
efforts
to
try
to
teach
these
people
in
english,
and
wouldn't
allow
them
to
go
back
to
the
spanish
and
the
spanish
culture
as
their
basic
tool.
then
of
course
in
1917
with
the
jones
act,
the
congress
had
provided
for
these
people
to
have
citizenship
and
to
be
permitted
to
enter
the
united
states
like
any
other
citizen.
and
it
is
true
that
it
was
after
this
time
that
the
great
influx
of
puerto
ricans
came
into
new
york
and
particularly
new
york
city.
i
think
there
were
seven
or
8000
in
earlier
period
and
later
it
become
some
700
or
800,000.
i
want
to
stop
for
a
moment
where
the
court
make
a
claim
that
the
problem
is
not
that
large.
the
problem
is
something
like
8146,
i
think
who
registered
under
section
4
(e)
in
this
particular
matter
and
is
now
involved.
it
may
--
it
probably
is
little
larger
than
that
because
there
is
a
possibility
that
others
who
could
register
did
not
as
it
is
always
the
case.
i
think
that
factually
in
regard
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
treatment
of
spanish
speaking
people
within
the
new
york
area
is
one
factor
that
the
congress
seem
to
be
well
aware
of
in
connection
with
the
legislation
and
should
be
recognized,
i
think,
in
the
examination
of
the
question
by
this
court.
the
spanish
language
papers
make
a
very
complete
coverage
of
all
political
matters
in
the
area.
they
are
eager
to
cover
all
of
the
happenings
of
political
action
in
the
new
york
area
and
they
do.
they
also
cover
all
of
the
wire
services,
they
translate
them
into
spanish.
they
set
out
the
various
provisions
of
speeches
and
constitutional
amendments.
any
other
particular
political
action
in
spanish,
denominate
them
so
that
the
spanish
people
can
find
them
on
the
ballot.
and
there
is
no
question
about
these
people
being
able
to
make
an
intelligent
use
of
the
ballot
even
though
they
are
spanish
speaking.
therefore,
i
think
that
that
factor
is
one
that
is
important
for
this
court
to
consider
in
examining
whether
congress
have
the
power.
and
in
exercising
that
power,
whether
it
exercise
it
within
the
limits
of
what
congress
may
do
in
considering
whether
that
such
legislation
is
proper
to
preserve
the
franchise
for
this
substantial
group
of
people
who
have
been
and
are
the
wards
of
this
country
in
their
living
within
new
york
city.
now,
as
i
read
lassiter,
this
court
did
not
say
that
the
states
could
pass
any
kind
of
limiting
legislation
upon
the
franchise
as
far
as
qualification
of
voters
are
concerned.
this
court
was
addressing
itself,
as
i
see
lassiter,
to
the
basic
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
voter
could
exercise
an
intelligent
use
of
the
ballot.
and
this
court
has
addressed
itself
within
the
last
few
years
to
many
problems
in
this
field.
but
if
it
had
not
reach
that
point
earlier,
we
certainly
have
reached
the
point
today
where
we
recognize
that
one
of
the
greatest
rights
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
can
have
is
the
right
to
vote,
to
participate
in
a
genuine,
full,
and
complete
vote
on
matters,
issues,
and
persons
in
the
electoral
process.
so
in
light
of
that
and
the
gloss
that
it
presents,
i
think
that
lassiter
can
only
be
read
with
the
idea
and
the
concept
that
this
court
was
searching
to
find
whether
or
not
the
states
were
infringing
by
the
qualifications
they
imposed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
but
i
think
it
has
this
factor
that
of
whether
or
not,
this
court
was
recognizing
that
the
states
had
an
unlimited
power
to
impose
qualifications
upon
the
right
to
vote.
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that's
my
--
exactly
correct,
mr.
justice.
the
only
thing
i
was
trying
to
start
with
was
that
lassiter
does
not
prevent
the
congress
from
taking
this
action.
and
i
assume
that
that
would
be
conceded.
then
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
congress
had
the
power
to
take
this
action
under
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
and
we
find
that,
as
i
said,
in
the
territorial
clause
and
in
section
5
article
14.
now,
i
think
that
section
5,
this
court
has
recognized,
congress
has
a
peculiar
right
and
opportunity
to
assess
the
--
of
whether
or
not
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
being
infringed
upon.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice.
not
that
i
recall.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
i
think
that
they
carefully
examined
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
congress
in
saying
that
was
exercising
properly
or
within
the
range
of
its
full
powers,
its
authority
under
the
constitution
is
finally
for
this
court
to
determine.
but
i'm
trying
to
deal
with
the
standards
that
this
court
would
apply.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
applying
those
standards,
the
court
would
inquire,
well
did
congress
just
liberally
take
this
action
or
did
it
examine
the
various
factors
that
would
be
involved.
and
one
of
the
factors
that
seem
to
me,
that
the
congress
did
examine
carefully
was
whether
or
not
there
could
be
an
intelligent
exercise
of
the
function
of
the
elector
under
or
by
the
spanish
speaking
citizen,
under
the
law
as
it
was
being
passed
in
4
(e).
and
whether
that
person,
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
spanish
speaking,
could
be
under
the
circumstances
that
congress
reviewed
anew
existed
in
new
york,
could
be
an
intelligent
voter
in
the
process.
and
therefore,
should
have
some
action
taken
because
of
that
and
also
because
the
gloss
of
the
experience
of
the
united
states
in
connection
with
puerto
rico
over
the
years.
and
the
further
fact
that
we
were
responsible
in
a
substantial
measure
for
the
fact
that
these
people
found
themselves
in
the
position
that
they
were
in
about
their
educational
process
concerning
the
spanish
language.
and
in
light
of
all
of
those
things,
whether
or
not,
congress
in
deciding
under
section
5,
that
this
law
should
be
passed
to
implement
and
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
was
justified
at
all
in
any
way
under
the
constitution
in
taking
such
action,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
basic
test.
and
congress
having
taken
that
action,
and
in
light
of
all
of
the
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
then
the
court
addressed
itself,
is
there
any
way
that
we
can
find
under
the
whole
constitution,
under
this
provision,
that
congress
was
in
fact
justified
or
if
it
wasn't
justified
--
i
don't
think
justified
is
even
the
proper
measure.
could
congress,
under
the
constitution,
make
a
determination
that
this
was
a
proper
exercise
of
section
5
power
to
implement
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
equal
protection?
and
if
there's
any
way
that
this
court
can
find
that
congress
had
such
a
power
even
though
this
court
would
decide,
we
certainly
wouldn't
do
that.
we
would
say
that
everyone
in
the
united
states
before
you
can
vote
has
to
be
able
to
speak
english.
that
is
not
the
test
and
this
court
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
if
you
assume
the
history
that
congress
was
dealing
with
here,
that
there'd
be
no
question
of
its
power
to
pass
4
(e)
in
regard
to
puerto
ricans
who
were
members
of
an
independent
or
members
of
the
state
of
the
union.
they
could
certainly
take
that
action
to
provide
adequately,
assuming
the
standard
is
what
are
the
qualifications
that
can
be
imposed
upon
a
voter?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
would
say
that
as
a
commonwealth
or
when
it
was
a
territory
that
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
under
the
constitution
to
them
was
even
greater
because
at
that
point
they
were
and
our
wards.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
only
in
this
respect
that
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
regard
to
its
wards
in
the
territories,
that
it
--
the
united
states
has
had
a
special
obligation
to
care
for
them
because
they
didn't
--
the
people
didn't
know
these
territories,
did
not
have
the
same
kind
of
rights
that
people
in
the
states
have
in
the
conduct
of
their
own
affairs.
now,
as
the
common
--
under
the
commonwealth,
the
relationship
was
changed
and
there
is
no
question
to
what
puerto
rico
has
the
absolute
right
depending
upon
the
examination
by
the
present
commission
of
the
full
extent
of
what
was
done
by
that
relationship.
but
generally,
as
to
its
internal
affairs,
that
was
what
that
arrangement
in
1958,
as
i
recall
the
date,
was
to
try
to
accomplish,
was
to
give
it
to
control
of
its
internal
affairs
so
it
could
advance
them
and
develop
in
the
remarkable
manner
that
it
has.
but
it
seems
to
me
this
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
that
the
united
states
does
have
a
special
obligation
in
regard
to
territories
that
he
has
taken
over
and
has
found
people
there
as
its
wards,
and
that's
the
only
distinction
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
question
about
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
i
think
there's
no
question
about
congress
having
such
power.
i
think
that
it
can
proceed
to
legislate,
to
provide
and
take
care
of
that
kind
of
a
situation.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
a
much
easier
one
then
that
because
of
the
situation
where
you
have
a
history
of
the
language
and
you
have
a
history
of
the
congress
examining
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
people
could
be
intelligent
voters
despite
the
language
difference.
and
of
course
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
it
is
the
same
standards,
that
is
six
years
of
schooling
that
is
set
forth
for
4
(e).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
recollection,
mr.
justice.
there
was
none.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
haven't
made
a
careful
enough
study
of
the
--
that
act
to
know
what
the
government's
brief
does
not
indicate
that
any
other
part
of
it
was
grounded
upon
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
my
recollection
in
the
newspaper
counts
that
was
all
that
i
would
thought.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
south
carolina.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
stand
before
you
and
urge
you
to
consider
that
legislation
being
constitutionally
valid.
if
you
could
find
any
place
within
the
constitution,
you
know
the
congress
have
decided
only
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i'm
sorry
i
can't
be
more
precise
about
my
answer
but
i
think
that
you're
entirely
correct
from
my
general
recollection
that
i
have
examined
carefully.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
find
no
such
limitation
in
the
clause
and
i
don't
find
that
this
court
has
ever
said
that
it
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
not
that
i
know
of.
i
don't
know
whether
the
philippine
case
could
in
anyway
shed
any
light
on
that
or
not.
if
you
recall
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
after
it
became
independent,
the
persons
who
are
then
within
the
country
had
become
aliens.
but
i
don't
believe
that
involved
precisely.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice,
i
--(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
this
court
would
examine
whatever
congress
undertook
to
do,
give
great
consideration
to
whether
there's
any
justification
or
any
power
on
which
the
congress
could
rely
and
would
try
to
determine
whether
it
was
properly
or
it
was
trying
to
carry
out
some
responsibility
toward
that
territory.
and
i
think
against
that,
it
would
have
to
weigh
whether
it
was
just
wiping
out
the
proper
area
of
the
states
to
act
to
try
to
continue
and
develop
as
states
of
the
union.
i
think
it
would
be
that
kind
of
a
problem
but
i
don't
say
that
you
could
just
--
but
i
think
that's
quite
a
different
case
than
this.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
i
arrived
at
that
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
has
reached
the
place
where
it
recognizes
qualifications
of
voters
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
right
to
vote
is
so
precious
under
our
constitutional
system,
that
such
qualifications
cannot
be
made
unless
they
fairly
contribute
to
an
intelligent
exercise
of
the
ballot
of
the
electoral
process.
and
at
any
time
that
the
states
depart
from
that
kind
of
a
standard,
it
would
not
be
recognized
by
this
court
as
a
valid
exercise
of
their
function
in
fixing
qualifications.
that
they
are
not
free
to
just
say,
“we
shall
composed
certain
qualifications
on
the
right
to
exercise
the
franchise.”
that
day
has
passed,
if
it
ever
existed.
and
we
have
reached
the
point
where
those
qualifications
are
to
reach
the
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
this
person
can
exercise
the
franchise
intelligently
and
properly
so
thus
to
advance
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
government
generally.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
of
recognition
that
there
is
more
to
section
5
than
is
found
in
section
1.
and
that
the
congress
and
the
country
in
adopting
the
amendment
intended
that
there'd
be
more.
and
i
think
that
adds
to
the
--
what
you
can
find
to
support
the
action
of
congress.
i
just
like
briefly
to
say
that
i
think
in
article
55
of
the
united
nation
charter,
there
is
further
ground
in
the
treaty
power
of
the
united
states
to
support
this
action
of
the
congress
in
trying
to
carry
out
the
obligations
that
the
united
states
took
upon
itself
in
connection
with
that
entire
program
under
that
charter.
and
furthermore
in
our
representing
to
the
united
nations
in
order
to
induce
it
to
accept
the
fact
that
puerto
rico
had
different
status
than
mandated
or
other
special
colonial
or
that
type
of
relationships
when
we
represented
to
them
that
puerto
rico
was
a
commonwealth
and
that
we
would
conduct
our
relationships
in
accordance
with
that
standard
and
that
agreement.
and
therefore,
the
united
nations
proceeded
to
decide
that
it
was
not
in
a
character
of
other
country's
territories
that
were
subject
to
its
other
provisions.
and
under
that
treaty
power,
the
united
states
did
take
this
action.
it
presented
it
to
the
united
nations
and
upon
that
ground,
the
united
nations
acted
and
we
think
it
recognized
an
obligation
there
to
try
to
carry
out
the
fact
that
it
had
agreed
under
article
5
not
to
discriminate
against
people
because
of
the
language
they
used.
therefore,
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
ample
ground
on
the
three
provisions
of
the
constitution
that
i've
suggested.
the
court
will
look
at
the
entire
constitution
with
all
of
the
amendments,
find
the
power
that
congress
had
the
power
that
the
only
issue
here
and
it
is
one
more
step
in
our
trying
to
help
people
of
this
country
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process
where
their
greatest
rights
lie.
thank
you.
