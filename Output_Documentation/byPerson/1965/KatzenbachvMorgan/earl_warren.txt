--
treaty
clause

well,
if

live
along
and
that
it
haven't
determine
in
court,
would

chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
think
you
have
any
rebuttal.
you
used
the
time
for
you
to
make
your
argument.
the
other
side
has
a
rebuttal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
puerto
rico
and
a
law
like
new
york
to
the
effect
that
no
one
could
vote
in
puerto
rico
unless
he
understood
that
he
could
read
spanish
language,
would
congress
have
any
power
to
say
that
as
they
did
in
4
(e)
that
they
would
have
a
right
to
vote
if
they
had
adequate
education
in
this
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
ask
you
been
ever
have
a
right
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
we're
not
asking
about
any
quarrel
between
the
people
of
puerto
rico.
i
ask
you
the
plain
question.
suppose
puerto
rico
and
a
law
like
new
york's
to
the
effect
that
no
one
could
vote
there
unless
he
could
read
and
understand
spanish.
would
congress
then
have
the
right
to
say
that
other
americans
who
spoke
only
english
could
vote
over
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
your
answer
is
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
coon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
mind
stating
again
very
briefly
what
the
court
was
--
the
exact
purpose
was
of
the
new
york
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
what
you
would
with
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
exceptions
to
the
--
to
the
act.let
me
put
it
in
this
language.
suppose
a
puerto
rican
who
didn't
understand
the
english
language
was
in
the
army
and
then
--
then
came
out
and
went
into
a
veterans
hospital.
how
would
that
purpose
be
affected
if
his
wife
and
his
parents
and
his
children
were
--
were
permitted
under
your
statute
to
vote
because
of
his
status?
how
does
that
conform
to
this
purpose
that
you
speak
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know
it's
part
of
the
argument
but
you
are
defending
the
act
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that's
clearly
understandable
but
how
about
his
wife,
how
about
his
parents,
how
about
his
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
the
soldier
who
is
in
the
hospital,
how
about
all
those
relatives
of
his,
does
that
show
that
they
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
how
about
your
grandfather
clause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
why
is
your
grandfather
clause
so
limited
by
definition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
context,
isn't
it
commonly
called
the
grandfather
clause
to
permit
someone
to
continue
as
he
has
because
he
was
continuing
--
he
was
doing
business
at
the
time
that
the
law
was
established.
chief
justice
earl
warren
