suppose
--
suppose
puerto
rico
were
federated
state
of
the
union
and
everything
else
remains
the
same,
that
is
to
say
that
principal
language
of
instruction
for
some
reason
with
spanish
and
congress
passed
4
(e)
for
the
purpose
of
making
sure
that
there
was
perhaps
no
discrimination
against
the
citizens
of
that
federated
state
of
the
union
who
might
move
to
new
york
and
satisfy
the
resident
requirements
there.
what
would
your
view
be
of
the
constitutional
result?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
your
argument
that
the
constitutionality
of
this
4
(e)
is
less
because
puerto
rico
is
a
--
is
a
commonwealth?
that
is
to
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
puerto
rico
were
a
federated
state
of
the
union,
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
that
the
equal
protection
clause
would
apply
and
perhaps
also
some
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
might
come
into
play.
justice
abe
fortas
well
at
that,
i
must
confess
a
whole
lot
of
argument
baffles
me.
that
is
to
say
you're
arguing
that
the
--
if
puerto
rico
were
a
territory,
it's
now
a
commonwealth.
the
word
‘territory'
that
by
virtue
of
the
territorial
clause,
the
obligation
of
the
congress
and
power
of
the
congress
with
respect
to
citizens
of
the
united
states,
resident
--
puerto
rico
would
be
greater
than
its
obligation
and
power
with
respect
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
reside
in
sister
states.
that
must
be
your
argument,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
suppose
new
york
stated
after
the
statute
that
said
that
people
who
come
to
new
york
state
from
massachusetts
can
vote
if
they
comply
with
qualifications
a,
b,
and
c.
but
if
they
come
to
new
york
state,
from
illinois,
then
the
qualifications
are
different.
i
stated
quite
clearly
that
it
would
be
invalid
for
some
constitutional
reason,
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
way
to
view
the
question
here
and
i'd
like
to
comment
on
this,
is
this.
suppose
that
there
were
a
federated
state
of
the
union
in
which
the
language
of
instruction
in
the
schools
was
spanish.
is
it
within
congress'
power
to
enact
a
law
that
is
designed
to
put
those
people
arguably
on
the
same
footing
so
far
as
voting
in
new
york
is
concerned
as
people
then
were
educated
in
other
federated
states
of
the
union.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
think
it
is
irrational
to
make
a
distinction
between
persons
who
are
educated
in
american
language
--
in
american
flag
schools
and
non-american
flag
schools.
that's
irrational.
justice
abe
fortas
does
connecticut
have
a
--
an
english
literacy
requirement?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
california?
justice
abe
fortas
we'll
make
the
assumption
that
new
mexico,
absurd
assumption
for
purposes
of
testing
the
theory.
and
new
mexico
adopted
such
statute
saying
that
only
persons
who
are
literate
in
spanish
could
vote
but
congress
have
the
power
to
override
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
congress
could
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
it's
because
of
your
theory
about
the
right
to
vote
being
a
right
that
is
not
protected
except
by
the
strict
language
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
think
that
a
state
could
confine
the
right
to
vote
to
catholics
or
jews,
or
protestants
or
whatever
it
might
be.
justice
abe
fortas
the
congress
did
not
and
that
congress
could
not
override
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
this
court
would
not
have
power
to
declare
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i'm
asking
you,
do
you
think
that
congress
would
have
power
to
override
it
against
to
that
note?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
court
could
not
properly
declare
that
unconstitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
as
of
what
date
is
this?
justice
abe
fortas
and
at
that
time
there
was
accompanying
this
english
literacy
provision,
provision
for
adult
education?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
does
that
include
more
than
an
oral
test?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
written
test.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that's
federal
law.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
think
you
wouldn't
--
are
you
saying
that
in
the
incentive
that
if
the
state
limits
voting
rights
in
order
to
provide
then
incentive
for
some
laudable
purpose
such
as
economic
improvement
that
that
is
a
violent
reason
for
the
limitation
of
the
franchise?
justice
abe
fortas
the
general
addressing
yourself
--
addressing
yourself
to
the
theoretical
considerations
here.
suppose
the
state
of
new
mexico
passed
the
law
saying
that
only
persons
who
were
lectured
in
spanish
could
vote,
would
it
be
your
position
that
congress
would
not
have
the
power
to
override
that
and
that
this
court
would
not
have
the
power
to
declare
it
as
unconstitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wouldn't
be
very
clear
about
this
but
a
flow
from
that
in
your
opinion
that
the
congress
would
have
power
on
your
second
hypothesis
to
enact
something
like
4
(e).
justice
abe
fortas
and
therefore,
congress
has
the
power
to
override
it.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
merely
a
matter
of
the
law
itself
being
unconstitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
