ms.
jean
m.
coon
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
the
scheduled
argument
of
cardona
against
power
immediately
following
the
argument
of
this
appeal,
the
presentation
of
our
argument
hereby
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
is
in
somewhat
reversed
order
from
the
argument
as
presented
in
our
brief
because
issues
which
are
similar
to
the
issues
in
cardona
if
not
reached
in
this
argument
can
be
handled
by
the
counsel
for
the
appellees
in
that
case.
i
think
it
would
be
somewhat
significant
at
this
point
to
discuss
a
few
statistics
with
this
court.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
affidavits
by
various
people
estimating
the
numbers
of
puerto
ricans
in
new
york
state
or
in
the
city
of
new
york
who
are
affected
by
4
(e).
but
these
affidavits
are
no
more
than
estimates.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
only
one
factual
basis
for
these
figures.
and
that
is
the
1960
census
report,
the
last
authoritative
counting
of
puerto
ricans
in
new
york
state.
that
census
report
showed
that
in
1960
there
were
642,600
and
some
puerto
ricans
in
the
entire
state
of
new
york
of
whom
194,000
were
mainland
born
and
may
be
presumed
literate
in
english
if
adults.
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
1960,
there
were
612,000
puerto
ricans,
182,000
of
whom
were
mainland
born.
the
percentages
which
the
census
figures
developed
for
the
state,
as
a
whole,
showed
that
approximately
50%
of
the
total
puerto
rican
population
in
new
york
state
were
of
voting
age.
and
that
approximately
60%
of
the
puerto
ricans
of
that
age
group
had
attained
an
education
either
in
spanish
or
english
of
seventh
grade
or
higher,
but
at
least
seventh
grade.
thus,
if
we
take
these
figures
for
the
state
as
a
whole
and
apply
them
to
what
we
know
as
to
the
total
population
of
the
city
of
new
york,
we
would
find
that
in
1960,
there
were
approximately
300,000
puerto
ricans
of
voting
age
in
the
city
of
new
york.
and
adopting
this
60%
figure
which
the
census
figures
apply
to
the
state
as
a
whole
in
the
attainment
of
a
seventh
grade
education,
we
would
find
that
in
1960,
it
could
be
estimated
that
had
4
(e)
then
been
enacted
and
could
puerto
ricans
vote
by
proof
of
literacy
either
in
english
or
spanish,
that
approximately
200,000
puerto
ricans
would
have
been
eligible
to
vote
in
new
york
city
at
that
time.
now,
how
many
puerto
ricans
actually
were
registered
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
1960?
in
19
--
approximately
1960,
the
city
of
new
york,
the
migration
division
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
various
civic
organizations
put
on
a
massive
campaign
to
specially
register
the
puerto
rican
population
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
compliance
with
new
york
state
english
literacy
requirement.
in
november
2nd
of
1960,
the
new
york
times
reported
that
this
effort
have
resulted
in
the
registration
of
230,000
puerto
rican
and
hispanic
residents
of
the
city
of
new
york
complying
with
the
english
literacy
requirements
of
new
york
state.
in
1961,
new
york
mayoralty
election,
it
was
reported
that
200,000
puerto
ricans
registered
and
voted
for
mayor
in
the
city
of
new
york.
and
the
conclusion
which
can
be
drawn
from
this
that
the
majority
of
puerto
rican
residents
of
the
city
of
new
york
can
comply
with
new
york's
english
literacy
requirement
is
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
last
november
with
new
york
city
complying
with
section
4
(e),
only
8,107
puerto
ricans
registered
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
that
this
figure
would
include
new
immigrants
to
the
city
who
might
equally
be
able
to
comply
with
new
york's
english
literacy
requirement.
these
studies
which
were
conducted
in
the
middle
of
1950's
by
the
new
york
city
board
of
education
demonstrated
that
students
coming
into
the
new
york
city
public
school
system
directly
from
puerto
rico
and
the
early
elementary
grade
did
have
a
reading
knowledge
of
the
english
language
in
addition
to
a
speaking
knowledge.
that
while
english
is
no
longer
the
major
language
of
instruction
in
the
school
within
puerto
rico,
english
is
taught
as
an
additional
language
from
the
first
grade
on
in
the
schools
in
puerto
rico.
puerto
ricans
do
not
come
to
the
mainland
totally
devoid
of
any
knowledge
of
english
either
spoken
or
written.
now,
let
us
look
to
the
genesis
of
the
two
statutes
which
are
involved
here.
new
york's
english
literacy
requirement
was
put
into
its
laws
at
a
time
when
there
were
only
7000
puerto
ricans
in
the
city
of
new
york.
it
was
not
put
into
law
to
prevent
puerto
ricans
from
participating
in
the
elective
franchise
in
new
york
significantly
at
the
time
this
became
part
of
new
york's
law
english
was
the
major
language
of
instruction
in
puerto
rico.
and
it
could
have
had
no
bearing
upon
puerto
ricans.
it
was
put
into
the
law
as
a
part
of
new
york's
solution
to
what
had
become
as
a
result
of
information
discovered
in
world
war
i
of
the
horrible
situation
of
draftees
who
could
not
take
oral
orders
in
english
of
the
hundredths
of
thousandths
of
persons
of
draft
age
in
the
united
states
who
were
not
literate
in
any
language.
it
was
put
into
a
--
the
law
in
answer
to
the
problem
which
had
arisen
of
industrial
safety
because
the
many
immigrants
who
could
--
who
had
joined
the
labor
force
in
the
state
were
not
able
to
understand
safety
regulations
in
english,
and
was
put
into
the
law
as
part
of
a
package
which
involved
also
the
intensified
adult
education
programs
in
english.
it
was
proposed
at
that
time
that
adult
education
programs
be
provided
in
the
places
of
employment
of
these
immigrants
so
that
the
english
language
and
the
advantages
to
them
which
would
come
from
learning
this
would
be
brought
to
them.
they
would
not
be
asked
to
go
to
the
schools.
there
was
additional
training
proposed
and
put
into
the
law
for
adult
or
for
non-adult,
children
who
had
pass
beyond
the
maximum
requirements
for
remaining
in
school,
the
groups
between
16
and
21
for
additional
after
working
hour
instruction.
so
that
new
york
statute
was
not
put
into
our
laws
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
any
discriminatory
program.
it
was
put
into
our
laws
in
order
to
promote
industrial
safety
promote
education,
promote
intelligent
participation
in
the
government
of
the
state,
and
to
encourage
the
learning
of
english
on
immigration
population
which
come
into
new
york.
significantly
at
this
point
even
in
1960,
47%
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
york
was
either
foreign
born
or
the
children
of
foreign
born
persons.
new
york
state
still
has
a
very
large
immigrant
or
first
generation
american
population.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
since
in
1960.
now,
for
section
4
(e)
which
is
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
new
york
act's
exact
purpose
was
to
promote
the
participation,
the
intelligent
participation
by
immigrant
groups
in
american
life,
both
political
and
economic.
it
was
part
of
a
package,
proposed
package
legislation
which
involved
increased
adult
education
in
english
and
government
which
involved
reaching
out
to
these
large
immigrant
groups
and
trying
to
bring
them
in
to
intelligent
participation
in
the
state
of
new
york.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
this
was
as
of
1919,
1920,
1921.
it
was
a
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
this
was
incidentally,
it
was
bipartisan,
it
was
put
into
effect
at
the
time
when
the
legislature
was
republican
and
the
governor
was
al
smith,
a
well-known
liberal
democrat
and
himself
a
child
of
an
immigrant
parent.
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
first
this
is
--
this
is
part
of
the
argument
of
course
that's
been
raised
in
cardona.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
part
of
the
argument
that
has
been
raised
in
the
cardona
case.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
of
course
as
to
the
veteran
himself.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
as
to
the
veteran
himself.
this
goes
to
the
fact
that
in
order
to
be
inducted
into
the
army,
he
must
initially
have
been
literate
in
english.
the
army
--
the
united
states
--
armed
forces
provided
that
for
inductions
the
army
from
puerto
rico
must
take
--
they
take
first
a
spanish
language
test
and
then
if
they
pass
that,
they
must
then
take
an
english
language
test.
i
must
demonstrate
literacy
in
english
to
be
inducted.
as
to
the
families,
i
think
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir,
it's
a
written
test.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
a
written
english
test.
additionally,
i
think
as
to
the
families,
this
becomes
--
let
us
say
one
more
of
the
incidences
where
special
legislation
has
been
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
armed
forces
veterans.
the
fact
that
you
exclude
a
group
for
a
legitimate
reason
does
not
make
the
regulation
itself
unreasonable.
the
--
as
to
the
--
for
example,
new
york
provides
where
you're
physically
handicapped,
you
may
pick
an
affidavit
that
except
for
the
physical
handicap,
you
can
read
and
write
english.
in
other
words,
a
man
who
is
not
able
physically
able
to
write
has
lost
a
hand
may
say
that
may
file
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
he
could
write
when
he
had
the
hand
or
would
be
able
to
write.
a
blind
man
may
say,
no,
he
hasn't
learned
braille,
but
before
he
went
blind,
he
could
have
read
english.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
--
those
were
physically
disabled
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
as
to
the
wife
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
i
think
as
--
i
think
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
if
it
goes
to
the
parents.
i
think
it
goes
as
to
the
wife
and
children.
and
it
carries
along
with
it
many
of
the
same
things
which
we
have
done
in
similar
situations
to
veterans
or
to
members
of
the
armed
forces,
that
rights
that
they
have
carry
on
to
their
families
even
though
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
it.
it
is
simply
a
carrying
over
to
the
families
of
veterans
some
of
the
rights
which
we
have
given
to
the
veterans.
so
for
example
then
congress
has
done
this
in
the
--
in
connection
with
purchasing
materials,
the
families
of
armed
servicemen
can
purchase
in
the
post
exchanges,
not
just
the
servicemen
themselves.
i
think
--
incidentally,
i
think
it's
very
interesting
that
an
immigrant
from
a
foreign
country
who
comes
into
puerto
rico
as
an
immigrant
of
puerto
rico
and
becomes
a
naturalized
american
citizen
in
puerto
rico
cannot
be
naturalized
there
unless
he
can
prove
literacy
in
english.
congress
provides
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
federal
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
our
grandfather
clause
i
think
was
--
is
not
a
true
grandfather
clause
in
the
first
place
because
the
true
definition
of
a
grandfather
clause
is
a
clause
which
gives
to
the
grandchildren
the
rights
possessed
by
the
grandparents.
in
this
case,
new
york
--
what
new
york
was
doing
here
is
saying
as
to
those
who
are
now
voters
in
1921,
those
who
are
voters
in
1921
will
not
be
disenfranchised
by
this
provision.
you
must
remember
also
that
a
good
chair
of
new
york
state
has
non-personnel
registration
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
a
person
who
had
registered
for
the
first
time
prior
to
1921
in
a
good
portion
of
new
york
state
would
not
at
that
time
have
been
required
to
reregister
at
any
time
in
the
future.
what
we're
doing
i
think
had
new
york
--
there's
a
possibility
that
had
new
york
after
1921
said
in
her
statute
that
everybody
will
have
to
reregister
and
demonstrate
literacy
in
english.
that
might
have
been
a
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
the
state
would
have
the
poli
--
the
power
to
disenfranchise
those
who
already
were
voters.
what
new
york
was
--
as
to
future
voters,
as
to
those
who
will
become
voters
after
this
act
takes
effect,
after
this
constitutional
amendment
takes
effect,
and
then
you
will
have
to
demonstrate
literacy
in
english.
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
true
grandfather
clause
to
any
extent.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
this
i
think
is
what
has
been
usually
referred
to
as
a
grandfather
clause
as
one
which
refers
to
the
past.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
--
it
is
a
grandfather
--
or
has
most
of
the
statutes
which
have
been
called
grandfather
clauses
are
ones
which
have
referred
to
giving
the
descendant's
rights
of
the
ancestor.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
loosely
this
may
be
a
term
that
is
used.
i
don't
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
loosely
this
may
be
the
term
that
is
used.
i
don't
think
it's
an
accurate
term
and
i
think
in
any
event
that
it
is
a
question
of
the
--
of
a
law
not
depriving
somebody
of
a
right
they
already
have.
i
think
you
raise
constitutional
the
questions
when
you
deprive
people
of
rights
which
they
have.
for
instance,
in
the
professional
licensing
provisions
where
they
have
--
where
somebody
has
been
practicing
a
profession
and
then
the
state
comes
along
and
licenses
the
profession,
frequently
they
will
provide
that
those
who
are
now
practicing
they
continue
because
you
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
may
deprive
somebody
of
what
is
almost
a
property
right
at
this
point,
when
they've
already
exercised
that
right.
and
that
is
what
new
york's
statute
does.
it
merely
preserved
the
rights
which
existed.
it
does
not
confer
future
rights
on
anyone.
for
example,
somebody
who
was
in
1921,
over
21
years
of
age
and
could
have
registered
but
had
not,
that
person
would
not
have
--
would
still
have
had
to
prove
english
literacy
in
order
to
register
after
1921.
the
provisions
of
the
--
as
to
the
territorial
powers
of
congress,
i
want
to
make
only
one
observation.
while
the
power
of
congress
as
to
legis
--
as
to
the
territories
is
plenary,
it
is
not
limited
by
the
relation
to
the
congressional
--
the
relationship
which
the
federal
government
has
to
the
states.
and
a
congress
may
act
as
to
the
territories
in
ways
which
it
may
not
act
as
to
the
states.
that
therefore,
we
must
remember
that
4
(e)
does
not
legislate
as
to
the
territory
of
puerto
rico.
it
confers
no
rights
upon
residents
of
puerto
rico.
it
confers
no
governmental
powers
upon
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
it
acts
only
as
to
the
states
in
limiting
the
acts
that
the
states
may
take
in
setting
what
would
be
otherwise
legitimate
voter
qualifications.
because
at
the
time
the
people
affected
or
the
people
are
affected,
they
are
not
citizens
of
puerto
rico.
they
would
at
that
point
be
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
reside
and
that
there
is
no
further
legitimate
territorial
interest.
one
of
the
counsel
today
spoke
of
this
as
the
4
(e)
as
winding
up
the
problem
of
puerto
rico.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
section
4
(e)
winds
up
nothing
as
to
puerto
rico
or
the
problems
of
puerto
ricans
coming
to
the
mainland.
as
long
as
puerto
ricans
come
into
the
mainland
have
--
get
lower
incomes
when
employed
have
a
higher
rate
of
unemployment
and
are
subjected
to
more
inadequate
housing
than
are
even
non-whites
in
new
york
city.
and
we
must
remember
that
96%
of
the
puerto
ricans
come
into
new
york
state
are
white,
that
the
problem
is
greater
than
voting.
the
problem
is
a
question
of
their
language
handicap
which
they
have
in
competing
economically
on
the
mainland.
because
in
elementary
education
or
even
a
high
school
education
in
spanish,
in
puerto
rico
opens
few
doors
in
the
mainland
economy
that
we
believe
that
new
york
statute
would
be
reasonable
even
if
we
take
it
only
as
to
puerto
ricans.
because
it
is
one
more
incentive
to
learn
english
so
that
they
may
participate,
compete
successfully
economically
on
the
mainland.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
this
that
it
is
that
the
removal
--
they
do
the
congress
the
removal
of
the
english
literacy
test
by
the
proponents
of
the
section
4
(e)
in
the
senate
suggested
that
the
removal
of
the
english
literacy
test
in
new
york
would
add
an
incentive
to
puerto
ricans
to
learn
english.
i
think
it
is
the
contrary
that
it
reduces
the
incentives
to
learn
english.
i
do
not
believe
that
you
could
impose
a
voter
qualification
form
or
you
could
limit
a
right
for
the
purpose
of
giving
someone
an
incentive.
but
i
think
that
where
you
are
here
would
be
removing
one
more
incentive
to
learn
english
which
if
the
--
if
it
is
such
a
tremendous
right
would
encourage
people
to
learn
english
and
this
would
help
them
in
competing
economically
in
new
york.
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
big
problems
that
new
york
has
been
faced
with.
it
is
the
problem
of
dealing
with
it
--
with
this
tremendous
puerto
rican
population
or
8%
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
york
is
either
from
puerto
rico
or
the
children
of
puerto
rican
parentage.
and
that
the
--
the
city
and
the
state
have
gone
out
and
try
to
reach
these
people.
additional
money
has
been
given
by
the
state
to
school
systems
to
provide
additional
aid
in
immigrant
groups
in
non-english
speaking
groups
to
teach
them
english.
someone
once
pointed
out
in
some
of
the
literature
on
the
subject
that
the
great
immigrant
populations
which
we
had
the
end
of
the
last
century
the
beginning
of
this
were
not
given
the
same
effort
--
the
same
effort
was
not
put
in
by
state
in
local
governments
to
assimilate
them
as
it's
being
done
today
in
the
case
of
the
puerto
ricans.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
have
two
answers
to
that
based
upon
different
assumptions.
assuming
that
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
by
far
the
majority
of
the
material
available
by
which
a
voter
could
exercise
an
independent
opinion
was
available
only
in
spanish
that
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
was
conducted
in
spanish
and
that
by
far
the
greater
language
of
understanding
in
new
mexico
was
spanish,
then
i
would
say
that
new
mexico's
law
was
valid
and
that
congress
would
have
no
power
to
override
it
and
that
it
would
be
a
reasonable
classification
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
require
literacy
in
spanish
in
new
mexico.
however,
where
the
converse
true,
where
the
government
of
new
mexico
as
it
is
conducted
in
english
was
the
multitude
of
opinion
published
in
new
mexico
published
in
english
was
by
far
the
greater
proportion
of
the
language
of
the
people
of
new
mexico
english,
then
i
would
say
that
to
establish
a
classification
such
as
you
suggest
that
only
those
who
are
literate
in
spanish
may
vote
is
itself
unreasonable
because
it
has
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
intelligent
exercise
of
the
franchise.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
it
would
be
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
classification.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
i
think
it's
an
--
it's
an
unreasonable
classification
under
the
law
and
that
is
why
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
that
congress
may
experiment
in
suggesting
what
congress
feels
is
an
area
of
discrimination
in
violation
of
what
is
the
equal
protection
clause
or
of
the
denial
of
privileges
and
immunities.
but
i
think
it
is
only
for
this
court
to
determine
in
the
ultimate
result
whether
congress
is
right
or
not.
for
instance
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
i
don't
know
that
--
of
course
the
preamble
of
4
(e)
here
is
that
we
don't
know
what
congress
started
with
because
there's
no
legislative
history.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
i
think
i
point
out
the
distinction
probably
between
this
case
and
the
rest
of
the
voting
rights
act
which
arose
--
which
this
court
discussed
in
the
south
carolina
case.
this
court
pointed
out
that
in
that
--
the
rest
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
long
amount
of
testimony
before
the
committees
of
congress.
the
evidence
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
fashioning
a
remedy
to
take
care
of
what
this
court
described
as
a
pervasive
evil.
none
of
this
evidence
exists
here.
there
was
no
committee
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
that
farther
confusion
here
is
the
fact
is
--
that
the
justice
department
itself
has
based
this
argument
most
in
the
territorial
powers
and
ignored
the
determination
of
congress
or
the
statement
of
congress
that
was
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
congress
can
create
a
new
violation
that
congress
may
say
what
it
thinks
a
violation
would
be.
but
it's
for
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
actually
constitutes
a
violation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
reviewed
by
the
same
standard
that
this
court
has
applied
in
many
other
cases
in
the
past
where
it
is
reviewed
certain
acts
--
acts
of
the
state
themselves
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
violate
these
provisions
in
the
constitution.
i
think
that
in
order
to
uphold
4
(e)
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
must
review
new
york
states
provisions
as
to
english
literacy
and
say
that
they
are
unreasonable
and
in
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
because
if
they
do
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
congress
has
never
done
this
before.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
congress
has
done
it
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
congress
has
an
enacted
legislation
under
the
fourteenth
which
merely
reenacted
things
--
those
things
which
the
courts
had
already
determined
where
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizenship
under
the
original
provisions
of
the
constitution.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
rather
point
out
to
this
court
something
that
you
said
in
the
south
carolina
case
that
--
which
dealt
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
rights.
that
this
court
has
held
that
when
congress
has
attacked
evils
which
were
not
included
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
the
court
has
held
them
to
be
--
those
acts
of
congress
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
the
same
thing
applies
here
in
these
fourteenth
amendment
cases
that
where
congress
has
--
or
if
it
oversteps
the
power
of
acting
as
to
those
things
which
are
included
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
this
court
has
the
power
to
say
to
congress,
“you
are
wrong.
you
cannot
create
new
violations
but
only
fashion
remedies
as
to
those
things
which
are
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
that
if
your
honors
please
that
our
brief
carries
in
a
very
definite
degree
that
this
is
not
an
equal
protection
problem
posed
by
this
situation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
the
scheduled
argument
of
cardona
against
power
immediately
following
the
argument
of
this
appeal,
the
presentation
of
our
argument
hereby
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
is
in
somewhat
reversed
order
from
the
argument
as
presented
in
our
brief
because
issues
which
are
similar
to
the
issues
in
cardona
if
not
reached
in
this
argument
can
be
handled
by
the
counsel
for
the
appellees
in
that
case.
i
think
it
would
be
somewhat
significant
at
this
point
to
discuss
a
few
statistics
with
this
court.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
affidavits
by
various
people
estimating
the
numbers
of
puerto
ricans
in
new
york
state
or
in
the
city
of
new
york
who
are
affected
by
4
(e).
but
these
affidavits
are
no
more
than
estimates.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
only
one
factual
basis
for
these
figures.
and
that
is
the
1960
census
report,
the
last
authoritative
counting
of
puerto
ricans
in
new
york
state.
that
census
report
showed
that
in
1960
there
were
642,600
and
some
puerto
ricans
in
the
entire
state
of
new
york
of
whom
194,000
were
mainland
born
and
may
be
presumed
literate
in
english
if
adults.
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
1960,
there
were
612,000
puerto
ricans,
182,000
of
whom
were
mainland
born.
the
percentages
which
the
census
figures
developed
for
the
state,
as
a
whole,
showed
that
approximately
50%
of
the
total
puerto
rican
population
in
new
york
state
were
of
voting
age.
and
that
approximately
60%
of
the
puerto
ricans
of
that
age
group
had
attained
an
education
either
in
spanish
or
english
of
seventh
grade
or
higher,
but
at
least
seventh
grade.
thus,
if
we
take
these
figures
for
the
state
as
a
whole
and
apply
them
to
what
we
know
as
to
the
total
population
of
the
city
of
new
york,
we
would
find
that
in
1960,
there
were
approximately
300,000
puerto
ricans
of
voting
age
in
the
city
of
new
york.
and
adopting
this
60%
figure
which
the
census
figures
apply
to
the
state
as
a
whole
in
the
attainment
of
a
seventh
grade
education,
we
would
find
that
in
1960,
it
could
be
estimated
that
had
4
(e)
then
been
enacted
and
could
puerto
ricans
vote
by
proof
of
literacy
either
in
english
or
spanish,
that
approximately
200,000
puerto
ricans
would
have
been
eligible
to
vote
in
new
york
city
at
that
time.
now,
how
many
puerto
ricans
actually
were
registered
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
1960?
in
19
--
approximately
1960,
the
city
of
new
york,
the
migration
division
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
various
civic
organizations
put
on
a
massive
campaign
to
specially
register
the
puerto
rican
population
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
compliance
with
new
york
state
english
literacy
requirement.
in
november
2nd
of
1960,
the
new
york
times
reported
that
this
effort
have
resulted
in
the
registration
of
230,000
puerto
rican
and
hispanic
residents
of
the
city
of
new
york
complying
with
the
english
literacy
requirements
of
new
york
state.
in
1961,
new
york
mayoralty
election,
it
was
reported
that
200,000
puerto
ricans
registered
and
voted
for
mayor
in
the
city
of
new
york.
and
the
conclusion
which
can
be
drawn
from
this
that
the
majority
of
puerto
rican
residents
of
the
city
of
new
york
can
comply
with
new
york's
english
literacy
requirement
is
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
last
november
with
new
york
city
complying
with
section
4
(e),
only
8,107
puerto
ricans
registered
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
that
this
figure
would
include
new
immigrants
to
the
city
who
might
equally
be
able
to
comply
with
new
york's
english
literacy
requirement.
these
studies
which
were
conducted
in
the
middle
of
1950's
by
the
new
york
city
board
of
education
demonstrated
that
students
coming
into
the
new
york
city
public
school
system
directly
from
puerto
rico
and
the
early
elementary
grade
did
have
a
reading
knowledge
of
the
english
language
in
addition
to
a
speaking
knowledge.
that
while
english
is
no
longer
the
major
language
of
instruction
in
the
school
within
puerto
rico,
english
is
taught
as
an
additional
language
from
the
first
grade
on
in
the
schools
in
puerto
rico.
puerto
ricans
do
not
come
to
the
mainland
totally
devoid
of
any
knowledge
of
english
either
spoken
or
written.
now,
let
us
look
to
the
genesis
of
the
two
statutes
which
are
involved
here.
new
york's
english
literacy
requirement
was
put
into
its
laws
at
a
time
when
there
were
only
7000
puerto
ricans
in
the
city
of
new
york.
it
was
not
put
into
law
to
prevent
puerto
ricans
from
participating
in
the
elective
franchise
in
new
york
significantly
at
the
time
this
became
part
of
new
york's
law
english
was
the
major
language
of
instruction
in
puerto
rico.
and
it
could
have
had
no
bearing
upon
puerto
ricans.
it
was
put
into
the
law
as
a
part
of
new
york's
solution
to
what
had
become
as
a
result
of
information
discovered
in
world
war
i
of
the
horrible
situation
of
draftees
who
could
not
take
oral
orders
in
english
of
the
hundredths
of
thousandths
of
persons
of
draft
age
in
the
united
states
who
were
not
literate
in
any
language.
it
was
put
into
a
--
the
law
in
answer
to
the
problem
which
had
arisen
of
industrial
safety
because
the
many
immigrants
who
could
--
who
had
joined
the
labor
force
in
the
state
were
not
able
to
understand
safety
regulations
in
english,
and
was
put
into
the
law
as
part
of
a
package
which
involved
also
the
intensified
adult
education
programs
in
english.
it
was
proposed
at
that
time
that
adult
education
programs
be
provided
in
the
places
of
employment
of
these
immigrants
so
that
the
english
language
and
the
advantages
to
them
which
would
come
from
learning
this
would
be
brought
to
them.
they
would
not
be
asked
to
go
to
the
schools.
there
was
additional
training
proposed
and
put
into
the
law
for
adult
or
for
non-adult,
children
who
had
pass
beyond
the
maximum
requirements
for
remaining
in
school,
the
groups
between
16
and
21
for
additional
after
working
hour
instruction.
so
that
new
york
statute
was
not
put
into
our
laws
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
any
discriminatory
program.
it
was
put
into
our
laws
in
order
to
promote
industrial
safety
promote
education,
promote
intelligent
participation
in
the
government
of
the
state,
and
to
encourage
the
learning
of
english
on
immigration
population
which
come
into
new
york.
significantly
at
this
point
even
in
1960,
47%
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
york
was
either
foreign
born
or
the
children
of
foreign
born
persons.
new
york
state
still
has
a
very
large
immigrant
or
first
generation
american
population.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
since
in
1960.
now,
for
section
4
(e)
which
is
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
new
york
act's
exact
purpose
was
to
promote
the
participation,
the
intelligent
participation
by
immigrant
groups
in
american
life,
both
political
and
economic.
it
was
part
of
a
package,
proposed
package
legislation
which
involved
increased
adult
education
in
english
and
government
which
involved
reaching
out
to
these
large
immigrant
groups
and
trying
to
bring
them
in
to
intelligent
participation
in
the
state
of
new
york.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
this
was
as
of
1919,
1920,
1921.
it
was
a
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
this
was
incidentally,
it
was
bipartisan,
it
was
put
into
effect
at
the
time
when
the
legislature
was
republican
and
the
governor
was
al
smith,
a
well-known
liberal
democrat
and
himself
a
child
of
an
immigrant
parent.
the
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
first
this
is
--
this
is
part
of
the
argument
of
course
that's
been
raised
in
cardona.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
part
of
the
argument
that
has
been
raised
in
the
cardona
case.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
of
course
as
to
the
veteran
himself.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
as
to
the
veteran
himself.
this
goes
to
the
fact
that
in
order
to
be
inducted
into
the
army,
he
must
initially
have
been
literate
in
english.
the
army
--
the
united
states
--
armed
forces
provided
that
for
inductions
the
army
from
puerto
rico
must
take
--
they
take
first
a
spanish
language
test
and
then
if
they
pass
that,
they
must
then
take
an
english
language
test.
i
must
demonstrate
literacy
in
english
to
be
inducted.
as
to
the
families,
i
think
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir,
it's
a
written
test.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
a
written
english
test.
additionally,
i
think
as
to
the
families,
this
becomes
--
let
us
say
one
more
of
the
incidences
where
special
legislation
has
been
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
armed
forces
veterans.
the
fact
that
you
exclude
a
group
for
a
legitimate
reason
does
not
make
the
regulation
itself
unreasonable.
the
--
as
to
the
--
for
example,
new
york
provides
where
you're
physically
handicapped,
you
may
pick
an
affidavit
that
except
for
the
physical
handicap,
you
can
read
and
write
english.
in
other
words,
a
man
who
is
not
able
physically
able
to
write
has
lost
a
hand
may
say
that
may
file
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
he
could
write
when
he
had
the
hand
or
would
be
able
to
write.
a
blind
man
may
say,
no,
he
hasn't
learned
braille,
but
before
he
went
blind,
he
could
have
read
english.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
--
those
were
physically
disabled
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
as
to
the
wife
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
i
think
as
--
i
think
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
if
it
goes
to
the
parents.
i
think
it
goes
as
to
the
wife
and
children.
and
it
carries
along
with
it
many
of
the
same
things
which
we
have
done
in
similar
situations
to
veterans
or
to
members
of
the
armed
forces,
that
rights
that
they
have
carry
on
to
their
families
even
though
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
it.
it
is
simply
a
carrying
over
to
the
families
of
veterans
some
of
the
rights
which
we
have
given
to
the
veterans.
so
for
example
then
congress
has
done
this
in
the
--
in
connection
with
purchasing
materials,
the
families
of
armed
servicemen
can
purchase
in
the
post
exchanges,
not
just
the
servicemen
themselves.
i
think
--
incidentally,
i
think
it's
very
interesting
that
an
immigrant
from
a
foreign
country
who
comes
into
puerto
rico
as
an
immigrant
of
puerto
rico
and
becomes
a
naturalized
american
citizen
in
puerto
rico
cannot
be
naturalized
there
unless
he
can
prove
literacy
in
english.
congress
provides
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
federal
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
our
grandfather
clause
i
think
was
--
is
not
a
true
grandfather
clause
in
the
first
place
because
the
true
definition
of
a
grandfather
clause
is
a
clause
which
gives
to
the
grandchildren
the
rights
possessed
by
the
grandparents.
in
this
case,
new
york
--
what
new
york
was
doing
here
is
saying
as
to
those
who
are
now
voters
in
1921,
those
who
are
voters
in
1921
will
not
be
disenfranchised
by
this
provision.
you
must
remember
also
that
a
good
chair
of
new
york
state
has
non-personnel
registration
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
a
person
who
had
registered
for
the
first
time
prior
to
1921
in
a
good
portion
of
new
york
state
would
not
at
that
time
have
been
required
to
reregister
at
any
time
in
the
future.
what
we're
doing
i
think
had
new
york
--
there's
a
possibility
that
had
new
york
after
1921
said
in
her
statute
that
everybody
will
have
to
reregister
and
demonstrate
literacy
in
english.
that
might
have
been
a
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
the
state
would
have
the
poli
--
the
power
to
disenfranchise
those
who
already
were
voters.
what
new
york
was
--
as
to
future
voters,
as
to
those
who
will
become
voters
after
this
act
takes
effect,
after
this
constitutional
amendment
takes
effect,
and
then
you
will
have
to
demonstrate
literacy
in
english.
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
true
grandfather
clause
to
any
extent.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
this
i
think
is
what
has
been
usually
referred
to
as
a
grandfather
clause
as
one
which
refers
to
the
past.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
--
it
is
a
grandfather
--
or
has
most
of
the
statutes
which
have
been
called
grandfather
clauses
are
ones
which
have
referred
to
giving
the
descendant's
rights
of
the
ancestor.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
loosely
this
may
be
a
term
that
is
used.
i
don't
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
loosely
this
may
be
the
term
that
is
used.
i
don't
think
it's
an
accurate
term
and
i
think
in
any
event
that
it
is
a
question
of
the
--
of
a
law
not
depriving
somebody
of
a
right
they
already
have.
i
think
you
raise
constitutional
the
questions
when
you
deprive
people
of
rights
which
they
have.
for
instance,
in
the
professional
licensing
provisions
where
they
have
--
where
somebody
has
been
practicing
a
profession
and
then
the
state
comes
along
and
licenses
the
profession,
frequently
they
will
provide
that
those
who
are
now
practicing
they
continue
because
you
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
may
deprive
somebody
of
what
is
almost
a
property
right
at
this
point,
when
they've
already
exercised
that
right.
and
that
is
what
new
york's
statute
does.
it
merely
preserved
the
rights
which
existed.
it
does
not
confer
future
rights
on
anyone.
for
example,
somebody
who
was
in
1921,
over
21
years
of
age
and
could
have
registered
but
had
not,
that
person
would
not
have
--
would
still
have
had
to
prove
english
literacy
in
order
to
register
after
1921.
the
provisions
of
the
--
as
to
the
territorial
powers
of
congress,
i
want
to
make
only
one
observation.
while
the
power
of
congress
as
to
legis
--
as
to
the
territories
is
plenary,
it
is
not
limited
by
the
relation
to
the
congressional
--
the
relationship
which
the
federal
government
has
to
the
states.
and
a
congress
may
act
as
to
the
territories
in
ways
which
it
may
not
act
as
to
the
states.
that
therefore,
we
must
remember
that
4
(e)
does
not
legislate
as
to
the
territory
of
puerto
rico.
it
confers
no
rights
upon
residents
of
puerto
rico.
it
confers
no
governmental
powers
upon
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
it
acts
only
as
to
the
states
in
limiting
the
acts
that
the
states
may
take
in
setting
what
would
be
otherwise
legitimate
voter
qualifications.
because
at
the
time
the
people
affected
or
the
people
are
affected,
they
are
not
citizens
of
puerto
rico.
they
would
at
that
point
be
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
reside
and
that
there
is
no
further
legitimate
territorial
interest.
one
of
the
counsel
today
spoke
of
this
as
the
4
(e)
as
winding
up
the
problem
of
puerto
rico.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
section
4
(e)
winds
up
nothing
as
to
puerto
rico
or
the
problems
of
puerto
ricans
coming
to
the
mainland.
as
long
as
puerto
ricans
come
into
the
mainland
have
--
get
lower
incomes
when
employed
have
a
higher
rate
of
unemployment
and
are
subjected
to
more
inadequate
housing
than
are
even
non-whites
in
new
york
city.
and
we
must
remember
that
96%
of
the
puerto
ricans
come
into
new
york
state
are
white,
that
the
problem
is
greater
than
voting.
the
problem
is
a
question
of
their
language
handicap
which
they
have
in
competing
economically
on
the
mainland.
because
in
elementary
education
or
even
a
high
school
education
in
spanish,
in
puerto
rico
opens
few
doors
in
the
mainland
economy
that
we
believe
that
new
york
statute
would
be
reasonable
even
if
we
take
it
only
as
to
puerto
ricans.
because
it
is
one
more
incentive
to
learn
english
so
that
they
may
participate,
compete
successfully
economically
on
the
mainland.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
this
that
it
is
that
the
removal
--
they
do
the
congress
the
removal
of
the
english
literacy
test
by
the
proponents
of
the
section
4
(e)
in
the
senate
suggested
that
the
removal
of
the
english
literacy
test
in
new
york
would
add
an
incentive
to
puerto
ricans
to
learn
english.
i
think
it
is
the
contrary
that
it
reduces
the
incentives
to
learn
english.
i
do
not
believe
that
you
could
impose
a
voter
qualification
form
or
you
could
limit
a
right
for
the
purpose
of
giving
someone
an
incentive.
but
i
think
that
where
you
are
here
would
be
removing
one
more
incentive
to
learn
english
which
if
the
--
if
it
is
such
a
tremendous
right
would
encourage
people
to
learn
english
and
this
would
help
them
in
competing
economically
in
new
york.
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
big
problems
that
new
york
has
been
faced
with.
it
is
the
problem
of
dealing
with
it
--
with
this
tremendous
puerto
rican
population
or
8%
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
york
is
either
from
puerto
rico
or
the
children
of
puerto
rican
parentage.
and
that
the
--
the
city
and
the
state
have
gone
out
and
try
to
reach
these
people.
additional
money
has
been
given
by
the
state
to
school
systems
to
provide
additional
aid
in
immigrant
groups
in
non-english
speaking
groups
to
teach
them
english.
someone
once
pointed
out
in
some
of
the
literature
on
the
subject
that
the
great
immigrant
populations
which
we
had
the
end
of
the
last
century
the
beginning
of
this
were
not
given
the
same
effort
--
the
same
effort
was
not
put
in
by
state
in
local
governments
to
assimilate
them
as
it's
being
done
today
in
the
case
of
the
puerto
ricans.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
have
two
answers
to
that
based
upon
different
assumptions.
assuming
that
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
by
far
the
majority
of
the
material
available
by
which
a
voter
could
exercise
an
independent
opinion
was
available
only
in
spanish
that
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
was
conducted
in
spanish
and
that
by
far
the
greater
language
of
understanding
in
new
mexico
was
spanish,
then
i
would
say
that
new
mexico's
law
was
valid
and
that
congress
would
have
no
power
to
override
it
and
that
it
would
be
a
reasonable
classification
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
require
literacy
in
spanish
in
new
mexico.
however,
where
the
converse
true,
where
the
government
of
new
mexico
as
it
is
conducted
in
english
was
the
multitude
of
opinion
published
in
new
mexico
published
in
english
was
by
far
the
greater
proportion
of
the
language
of
the
people
of
new
mexico
english,
then
i
would
say
that
to
establish
a
classification
such
as
you
suggest
that
only
those
who
are
literate
in
spanish
may
vote
is
itself
unreasonable
because
it
has
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
intelligent
exercise
of
the
franchise.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
it
would
be
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
classification.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
i
think
it's
an
--
it's
an
unreasonable
classification
under
the
law
and
that
is
why
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
that
congress
may
experiment
in
suggesting
what
congress
feels
is
an
area
of
discrimination
in
violation
of
what
is
the
equal
protection
clause
or
of
the
denial
of
privileges
and
immunities.
but
i
think
it
is
only
for
this
court
to
determine
in
the
ultimate
result
whether
congress
is
right
or
not.
for
instance
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
i
don't
know
that
--
of
course
the
preamble
of
4
(e)
here
is
that
we
don't
know
what
congress
started
with
because
there's
no
legislative
history.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well
i
think
i
point
out
the
distinction
probably
between
this
case
and
the
rest
of
the
voting
rights
act
which
arose
--
which
this
court
discussed
in
the
south
carolina
case.
this
court
pointed
out
that
in
that
--
the
rest
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
long
amount
of
testimony
before
the
committees
of
congress.
the
evidence
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
fashioning
a
remedy
to
take
care
of
what
this
court
described
as
a
pervasive
evil.
none
of
this
evidence
exists
here.
there
was
no
committee
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
that
farther
confusion
here
is
the
fact
is
--
that
the
justice
department
itself
has
based
this
argument
most
in
the
territorial
powers
and
ignored
the
determination
of
congress
or
the
statement
of
congress
that
was
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
congress
can
create
a
new
violation
that
congress
may
say
what
it
thinks
a
violation
would
be.
but
it's
for
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
actually
constitutes
a
violation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
reviewed
by
the
same
standard
that
this
court
has
applied
in
many
other
cases
in
the
past
where
it
is
reviewed
certain
acts
--
acts
of
the
state
themselves
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
violate
these
provisions
in
the
constitution.
i
think
that
in
order
to
uphold
4
(e)
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
must
review
new
york
states
provisions
as
to
english
literacy
and
say
that
they
are
unreasonable
and
in
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
because
if
they
do
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
congress
has
never
done
this
before.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
congress
has
done
it
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
congress
has
an
enacted
legislation
under
the
fourteenth
which
merely
reenacted
things
--
those
things
which
the
courts
had
already
determined
where
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizenship
under
the
original
provisions
of
the
constitution.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
rather
point
out
to
this
court
something
that
you
said
in
the
south
carolina
case
that
--
which
dealt
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
rights.
that
this
court
has
held
that
when
congress
has
attacked
evils
which
were
not
included
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
the
court
has
held
them
to
be
--
those
acts
of
congress
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
the
same
thing
applies
here
in
these
fourteenth
amendment
cases
that
where
congress
has
--
or
if
it
oversteps
the
power
of
acting
as
to
those
things
which
are
included
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
this
court
has
the
power
to
say
to
congress,
“you
are
wrong.
you
cannot
create
new
violations
but
only
fashion
remedies
as
to
those
things
which
are
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
think
that
if
your
honors
please
that
our
brief
carries
in
a
very
definite
degree
that
this
is
not
an
equal
protection
problem
posed
by
this
situation.
