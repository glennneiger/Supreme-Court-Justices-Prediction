justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
change
of
policy
with
respect
to
the
language
to
be
taught
in
the
puerto
rican
schools,
resolution
of
congress
or
an
act
of
congress
or
something
decided
at
the
administrative
level
or
what
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
understand
the
problem,
mr.
ranklin.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
interesting
chronicle
but
i
was
wondering,
where
can
we
find
--
where
--
who
made
that
change
of
policy
in
1946,
was
it
our
congress,
was
it
our
executive,
or
was
it
made
in
puerto
rico
with
our
acquiescence
or
where
can
we
find
that
either
in
the
record
or
some
of
the
briefs?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
said
at
the
very
outset
of
your
argument,
general
rankin,
the
question
here
is
quite
a
different
one.
this
issue
in
this
case
is
the
power
of
congress,
the
power
of
congress
to
pass
a
specific
piece
of
legislation.
quite
a
different
issue
from
the
one
that
you
had
before
us
in
the
lassiter
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
we
all
know
that
it's
not
unlimited.
justice
potter
stewart
carrington
against
rash
shows
that
but
the
--
but
even
assuming
that
the
state
did
have
an
unlimited
power
in
the
absence
of
an
act
of
--
an
act
of
congress.
here
we
have
an
act
of
congress
which
obviously
is
in
conflict
with
the
new
york
statute
and
the
question
is
that
power
of
congress
under
the
constitution
which
is
quite
a
separate
and
distinct
and
different
question
from
the
question
before
us
in
the
lassiter
case.
now,
you
said
that
the
outset
of
your
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
neither
you
nor
i
misunderstand
these
reports
here.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
consideration
of
the
4
(e)
in
the
committee
of
either
house,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
something
added.
justice
potter
stewart
something
new
that
was
added
to
it
after
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
considered
of
the
basic
legislation
by
the
committee,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
the
only
part
of
the
voting
act
and
rights
act
of
1965
that
is
grounded
on
anything
other
than
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
basically,
it
was
fifteenth
amendment
legislation,
was
it
not?
that
was
the
president's
message.
that
was
the
--
and
that
was
the
consideration
of
the
--
it
was
given
consideration
by
the
committees
and
the
two
houses
on
a
--
upon
the
fifteenth
--
this
is
fifteenth
amendment
legislation,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
know
it
was
recently,
the
courts
after
they've
decided
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
other
more
generalized
provisions
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
on
valid
grounds.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
an
argument
in
favor
of
the
appellant
in
the
next
case,
isn't
it?
the
cardona
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
mr.
cardona
or
mrs.
cardona
told
us.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
if
cardona
prevails
in
the
next
case,
well
then
your
niece
from
chile
could
vote
in
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
since
1960?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
correction,
a
legislative
correction
by
the
national
legislative
body
on
acting
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
correct
an
invidious
discrimination
imposed
by
state
law,
is
that
right?
well,
under
the
hypothesis,
your
second
hypothesis,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
must
be
some
negroes
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
anybody
--
is
there
anybody
there
of
asiatic
ancestry?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
should
too
and
they
wouldn't
--
they
would
be
of
the
yellow
races.
justice
potter
stewart
or
they're
--
or
what
if
there
were
any
american-indian.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
may
be
true
but
in
fact,
i
suppose
there
may
be
some
american-indians
whether
americans.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
may
as
a
matter
of
practice
and
that
they're
more
is
asked,
they
don't
call
me
an
american-indian,
call
me
a
puerto
rican.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
army.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
change
of

justice
