mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
present
my
respectful
greetings
to
this
honorable
court
as
i
appear
before
you
for
the
first
time.
the
facts
in
these
cases
are
undisputed
and
they
have
been
adequately
presented
to
the
court
by
it
two
distinguish
solicitors
that
have
preceded
me.
therefore,
i
will
not
belabor
the
facts
but
i
will
go
directly
to
the
matters
which
bring
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
before
you
today.
the
relationship
between
puerto
rico
and
the
united
states
dates
back
to
the
closing
of
the
19th
century
when
spain
ceded
the
ireland
to
the
united
states
as
a
result
of
the
spanish-american
war.
a
territorial
government
was
established
by
congress
in
1900
in
the
exercise
of
its
territorial
powers
under
the
powers
it
derived
from
the
treaty
of
paris.
in
the
insular
cases,
this
court
characterized
puerto
rico
as
an
unincorporated
territory
belonging
to
but
not
a
part
of
the
united
states
and
as
such,
under
the
plenary
powers
of
congress
to
legislate
for
the
ireland
on
turmoil
by
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
generally
applicable
to
the
state
and
federal
government
as
a
body
in
union.
in
1917,
the
congress
passed
an
organic
act
which
granted
puerto
rico
a
wider
measure
of
self-government
and
which
granted
american
citizenship
to
the
citizens
of
puerto
rico.
as
a
result
of
this
legal
relationship,
an
increasing
number
of
puerto
ricans
began
to
migrate
into
the
united
states.
this
migration
has
continued
to
the
present
when
there
are
almost
900,000
puerto
ricans
who
are
settled
in
the
50
states
of
the
union
with
concentration
in
new
york
city.
when
the
united
states
first
assumed
its
responsibilities
over
puerto
rico,
it
attempted
to
establish
english
as
a
language
of
instruction
in
puerto
rican
schools.
cultural
realities
soon
forced
an
abandonment
of
this
policy
and
spanish
was
increasingly
used
as
the
educational
medium.
as
a
result,
the
puerto
ricans
who
migrated
into
the
united
states
brought
with
them
a
spanish
cultural
and
educational
background.
all
of
these
prevailed
throughout
the
period
which
extended
up
to
1952
during
which
the
congress
retained
plenary
powers
over
puerto
rico
and
during
which
the
commissioner
of
education
who
set
the
policy
regarding
the
language
of
instruction
was
a
presidential
appointee.
in
1952,
the
former
legal
relationship
of
puerto
rico
as
dependent
territory
to
the
united
states
came
to
an
end.
the
congress
enabled
the
puerto
rican
people
to
ordain
and
establish
their
own
government
through
a
written
constitution
which
gave
puerto
rico
exclusive
control
over
its
local
affairs
among
which
was
the
education
of
its
people.
the
newly
governed
relationship
that
evolved
has
become
known
as
a
compact
of
association
between
puerto
rico
and
the
united
states,
the
nature
of
this
status
is
not
one
of
the
matters
that
are
in
issue
before
the
court
today.
this
new
status
permitted
the
united
states
to
secure
exemption
from
the
united
nations'
supervision
over
puerto
rico
as
colonial
territory
and
pursuant
to
article
73
(e)
of
chapter
11
of
the
united
nations
charter,
it
was
necessary
to
assure
the
united
nations
among
other
things
that
puerto
ricans
were
not
subjected
to
having
any
dominant
language
imposed
upon
them
as
a
condition
to
enjoin
the
basic
rights
of
citizenship.
under
the
cultural
autonomy
guaranteed
by
the
new
status,
puerto
ricans
have
been
educated
completely
in
the
spanish
language
and
english
has
been
taught
as
a
second
language.
the
net
result
of
this
policy
has
been
that
puerto
ricans
with
only
grade
school
or
some
even
with
high
school
education
are
not
functional
literates
in
the
english
language
though
they
are
so
in
the
spanish
language.
the
new
status
had
preserved
the
common
american
citizenship
for
the
puerto
ricans
and
the
freedom
of
movement
to
and
from
the
states.
the
migratory
pattern
has
continued
and
a
circular
movement
of
persons
from
puerto
rico
to
the
states
and
back
to
puerto
rico
is
an
ever
present
characteristic
of
the
puerto
rican-american
association.
presently
there
are
about
730,000
puerto
ricans
living
in
new
york
city.
about
400,000
--
480,000
are
of
voting
age.
less
than
one-third
of
these
or
approximately
150,000
are
registered
to
vote.
there
are
no
exact
figures
as
to
how
--
how
many
of
the
unregistered
330,000
are
literate
in
the
spanish
language
but
it
is
perhaps
relevant
to
point
out
in
this
connection
that
the
literacy
rate
in
puerto
rico
is
83%.
it
is
the
policy
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
to
help
migrant
puerto
ricans
integrate
into
the
mainstream
of
american
life.
it
maintains
a
program
of
instruction
for
those
on
the
island,
for
contemplating
to
move
to
the
states.
it
has
established
offices
in
major
cities
to
assist
both
the
migrants
and
their
new
host
in
their
adjustment
process.
it
carries
on
intensive
programs
in
mainland
city
to
urge
puerto
rican
migrants
to
go
to
night
school
to
improve
skills
and
learn
english
or
in
order
that
they
may
play
a
more
meaningful
role
in
the
communities
they
have
chosen
to
join.
nevertheless,
there
is
no
device
more
effective
in
procuring
the
integration
of
their
people
to
a
community
on
the
free,
unrestricted
and
universal
use
of
the
franchise.
the
power
of
the
vote
more
than
anything
else
is
the
key
to
better
living
conditions,
to
better
jobs,
to
better
treatment
at
the
hands
of
officials,
and
to
better
opportunities
to
enjoy
life
as
a
whole.
but
as
pointed
out
above,
out
of
480,000
puerto
ricans
of
voting
age
in
new
york,
only
150,000
are
registered
to
vote.
the
remaining
330,000
may
be
unregistered
for
a
number
of
reasons,
but
the
principal
reason
that
we
know
of
is
that
new
york
law
requires
a
literacy
test
in
english
and
that
it
provides
that
only
an
education
in
the
english
language
is
presumptive
of
literacy.
it
does
not
matter
to
new
york
state
that
the
puerto
rican
is
a
natural
born
citizen
that
he
has
been
educated
in
american
flag
schools
in
spanish,
that
he
knows
civic
and
government,
that
he
reads
spanish
language
newspapers
and
periodicals
in
new
york
which
informed
him
fully
about
issues
and
candidates,
that
he
listens
to
spanish
language
programs
of
news
and
information
in
radio
and
television.
when
it
comes
to
voting,
the
puerto
rican
cannot
show
his
education
in
american
flag
schools
as
evidence
of
literacy
even
though
his
english
speaking
brother
may
show
his
education
in
place
of
taking
the
literacy
test.
mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
a
school
that
is
conducted
anywhere
where
the
american
flag
flies
with
jurisdiction
over
the
particular
area
where
the
flag
might
fly.
mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
for
instance,
guam.
for
instance,
the
canal
zone.
for
instance,
puerto
rico.
mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
yes,
they're
all
american
flag
schools
because
the
american
flag
flies
over
puerto
rico.
mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
not
necessarily.
mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
yes,
it
is
supported
locally
though
we
get
the
grants
from
the
federal
government
also.
mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
yes,
your
honor.
section
4
(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
merely
removes
this
unwarranted
discrimination
to
which
i
just
referred
myself.
it
does
not
nullify
illiteracy
requirement
of
new
york
city.
it
simply
allows
american
citizens
educated
in
spanish,
in
schools
where
the
american
flag
flies
to
also
show
their
education
as
evidence
of
literacy
thus
removing
the
discriminatory
inequality
to
which
they
were
subjected
to
by
new
york
law
as
against
their
fellow
citi
--
fellow
american
citizens
who
were
educated
in
the
english
language.
section
4
(e)
corrects
the
deep
feeling
of
injustice
of
the
puerto
rican
voters
in
new
york
who
could
see
no
reason
why
their
education
was
not
as
good
as
that
of
their
english
speaking
brothers
for
voting
purposes.
it
puts
the
graduates
of
puerto
rican
schools
on
an
equal
footing
with
graduates
from
other
american
schools
as
far
as
literacy
is
made
a
requirement
for
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
the
fourteenth
amendment
calls
for
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
section
5
empowers
the
congress
to
make
back
directive
effective
through
appropriate
legislation.
historically,
both
the
congress
and
the
federal
judiciary
have
been
called
upon
to
enforce
the
amendment
by
decision
or
by
legislation.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
congress
who
took
the
initiative
to
relieve
the
puerto
ricans
of
the
unequal
burden
put
upon
them
by
the
laws
of
new
york;
that
decision
of
congress
is
entitled
to
all
due
respect
from
the
judiciary
we
just
customarily
granted
the
legislative
branch
wide
latitude
in
making
these
judgments.
in
this
case,
the
congress
assessed
a
number
of
factors
especially
suited
to
a
legislative
and
political
judgment.
let
me
state
what
they
were.
the
relationship
of
puerto
rico
to
the
united
states,
the
international
commitments
of
the
united
states,
the
grant
of
american
citizenship
to
the
puerto
rican
people,
the
substantial
migration
of
puerto
ricans
into
the
united
states,
the
cultural
autonomy
of
puerto
rico
fostered
by
congress,
the
struggle
of
the
migrant
puerto
ricans
in
the
united
states
to
integrate
into
their
mainstream
of
american
social
economic
and
political
life,
and
most
important
of
all,
the
reasonableness
of
the
requirement
of
english
literacy
as
it
bears
upon
the
intelligent
use
of
the
franchise
in
the
linguistic
environment
of
new
york
city.
having
weighed
all
these
factors,
congress
concluded
that
it
was
necessary
to
correct
the
legislation
of
new
york
in
order
to
strike
out
the
inequality
which
resulted
for
the
literate
american
citizen
educated
in
an
american
flag
school
in
spanish.
this
judgment
is
fair
and
reasonable.
and
the
result
in
legislation
is
entirely
within
the
bounds
of
the
fifth
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
construction
of
the
constitution
which
the
court
is
called
upon
to
make
today
would
permit
the
congress
the
necessary
latitude
to
deal
with
justice
towards
the
people
with
whom
the
country
is
associated
in
a
bond
of
friendship,
mutual
respect,
and
good
will.
as
technological
progress
brings
all
the
people
well
closer
and
ideological
differences
tend
to
divide
them.
this
court
should
keep
its
eye
as
it
always
has
in
the
needs
of
this
nation
for
an
adequate
legal
framework
with
which
to
face
the
challenges
of
tomorrow
and
with
which
to
adapt
to
a
complex
future.
mr.
rafael
hernandez
colon
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
present
my
respectful
greetings
to
this
honorable
court
as
i
appear
before
you
for
the
first
time.
the
facts
in
these
cases
are
undisputed
and
they
have
been
adequately
presented
to
the

by
it
two
distinguish

therefore,
i
will
not
belabor
the
facts
but
i
will
go
directly
to
the
matters
which
bring
the
commonwealth
of
puerto

before

today.
the
relationship
between
puerto

and
the

dates
back
to
the
closing
of
the
19th

as

an

continued
to
the
present
when

use
of
the
franchise.
the
power
of
the
vote
more
than
anything
else
is
the
key
to
better
living
conditions,
to
better
jobs,
to
better
treatment
at
the
hands
of
officials,
and
to
better
opportunities
to
enjoy
life
as
a
whole.
but
as
pointed
out
above,
out
of
480,000
puerto
ricans
of
voting
age
in
new
york,
only
150,000
are
registered
to
vote.
the
remaining
330,000
may
be
unregistered
for
a
number
of
reasons,
but
the
principal
reason
that
we
know
of
is
that
new
york
law
requires
a
literacy
test
in
english
and
that
it
provides
that
only
an
education
in
the
english
language
is
presumptive
of
literacy.
it
does
not
matter
to
new
york
state
that
the
puerto
rican
is
a
natural
born
citizen
that
he
has
been
educated
in
american
flag
schools
in
spanish,
that
he
knows
civic
and
government,
that
he
reads
spanish
language
newspapers
and
periodicals
in
new
york
which
informed
him
fully
about
issues
and
candidates,
that
he
listens
to
spanish
language
programs
of
news
and
information
in
radio
and
television.
when
it
comes
to
voting,
the
puerto
rican
cannot
show
his
education
in
american
flag
schools
as
evidence
of
literacy
even
though
his
english
speaking
brother
may
show
his
education
in
place
of
taking
the
literacy
test.

section
4
(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
merely
removes
this
unwarranted
discrimination
to
which
i
just
referred
myself.
it
does
not
nullify
illiteracy
requirement
of
new
york
city.
it
simply
allows
american
citizens
educated
in
spanish,
in
schools
where
the
american
flag
flies
to
also
show
their
education
as
evidence
of
literacy
thus
removing
the
discriminatory
inequality
to
which
they
were
subjected
to
by
new
york
law
as
against
their
fellow
citi
--
fellow
american
citizens
who
were
educated
in
the
english
language.
section
4
(e)
corrects
the
deep
feeling
of
injustice
of
the
puerto
rican
voters
in
new
york
who
could
see
no
reason
why
their
education
was
not
as
good
as
that
of
their
english
speaking
brothers
for
voting
purposes.
it
puts
the
graduates
of
puerto
rican
schools
on
an
equal
footing
with
graduates
from
other
american
schools
as
far
as
literacy
is
made
a
requirement
for
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
the
fourteenth
amendment
calls
for
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
section
5
empowers
the
congress
to
make
back
directive
effective
through
appropriate
legislation.
historically,
both
the
congress
and
the
federal
judiciary
have
been
called
upon
to
enforce
the
amendment
by
decision
or
by
legislation.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
congress
who
took
the
initiative
to
relieve
the
puerto
ricans
of
the
unequal
burden
put
upon
them
by
the
laws
of
new
york;
that
decision
of
congress
is
entitled
to
all
due
respect
from
the
judiciary
we
just
customarily
granted
the
legislative
branch
wide
latitude
in
making
these
judgments.
in
this
case,
the
congress
assessed
a
number
of
factors
especially
suited
to
a
legislative
and
political
judgment.
let
me
state
what
they
were.
the
relationship
of
puerto
rico
to
the
united
states,
the
international
commitments
of
the
united
states,
the
grant
of
american
citizenship
to
the
puerto
rican
people,
the
substantial
migration
of
puerto
ricans
into
the
united
states,
the
cultural
autonomy
of
puerto
rico
fostered
by
congress,
the
struggle
of
the
migrant
puerto
ricans
in
the
united
states
to
integrate
into
their
mainstream
of
american
social
economic
and
political
life,
and
most
important
of
all,
the
reasonableness
of
the
requirement
of
english
literacy
as
it
bears
upon
the
intelligent
use
of
the
franchise
in
the
linguistic
environment
of
new
york
city.
having
weighed
all
these
factors,
congress
concluded
that
it
was
necessary
to
correct
the
legislation
of
new
york
in
order
to
strike
out
the
inequality
which
resulted
for
the
literate
american
citizen
educated
in
an
american
flag
school
in
spanish.
this
judgment
is
fair
and
reasonable.
and
the
result
in
legislation
is
entirely
within
the
bounds
of
the
fifth
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
construction
of
the
constitution
which
the
court
is
called
upon
to
make
today
would
permit
the
congress
the
necessary
latitude
to
deal
with
justice
towards
the
people
with
whom
the
country
is
associated
in
a
bond
of
friendship,
mutual
respect,
and
good
will.
as
technological
progress
brings
all
the
people
well
closer
and
ideological
differences
tend
to
divide
them.
this
court
should
keep
its
eye
as
it
always
has
in
the
needs
of
this
nation
for
an
adequate
legal
framework
with
which
to
face
the
challenges
of
tomorrow
and
with
which
to
adapt
to
a
complex
future.
