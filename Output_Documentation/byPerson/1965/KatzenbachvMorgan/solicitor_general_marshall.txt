mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
--
highly
relevant.
we
view
the
statute
only
as
it
bears
on
american
citizens
now
residing
on
the
mainland
who
are
educated
in
spanish
language
schools
in
puerto
rico.
and
it's
the
only
question
presented
by
this
case,
and
it
is
as
a
practical
matter,
probably
the
only
application
of
section
4
(e)
that
will
ever
arise.
we
first
rely
on
article
4,
section
3
of
our
constitution
which
provides,
“that
congress
shall
have
power
to
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
respecting
the
territory
belonging
to
the
united
states”.
and
the
treaty
of
paris
in
1898
by
which
puerto
rico
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
provides
specifically
at
the
civil
rights
and
political
status
of
the
native
inhabitants
of
puerto
rico
shall
be
determined
by
congress.
and
this
was
implemented
over
and
over
again
by
granting
citizenship
in
1917
to
the
residents
of
that
territory.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
is
now
powerless
to
effectuate
its
policy
with
respect
to
puerto
ricans
who
moved
to
the
mainland
by
providing
a
shield
against
state
laws
which
disqualify
them
from
voting.
and
getting
to
this,
i
emphasize
two
points.
the
fact
that
spanish
yesterday
and
has
for
several
decades
been
the
language
of
instruction
in
puerto
rican
schools,
is
ultimately
directly
attributable
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
which
while
it
had
direct
control
of
the
educational
policy
of
puerto
rico,
did
make
a
slight
effort
to
impose
english
as
a
predominant
language
but
abandoned
that
effort.
and
with
the
knowledge
of
the
consequences,
gave
the
control
to
locally
elected
officials
knowing
full
well
that
those
officials
would
continue
to
use
spanish
as
the
language
in
schools.
and
in
1952,
the
agreement
was
made
and
so
as
of
that
date
on,
there
was
no
question
that
congress
deliberately
set
upon
the
path
of
having
spanish
to
be
the
language
spoken
in
the
puerto
rican
public
schools.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
they
were
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
it
was
when
we
had
charge
of
it
back
in
the
--
after
the
jones
act.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
we
tried
to
get
them
to
put
in
english
of
the
predominant
language.
and
the
reports
came
back,
i
don't
remember
the
exact
date
but
the
reports
came
back
that
would
--
dissented
in
1946
but
the
reports
came
back
that
it
was
not
working.
you
couldn't
establish
a
bilingual
school
system
because
the
large
percentage
of
the
community,
the
home
and
everything
spoke
spanish,
and
the
only
time
the
youngsters
spoke
english
was
in
school.
and
so
they've
just
abandoned
it.
they
did
make
some
people
say,
“i
have
hardly
attempt”,
but
an
attempt
was
made.
and
in
1946,
it
was
just
abandoned
completely.
and
finally
in
1952,
we
get
to
the
point
of
the
absolute
freedom.
the
fact
that
we
had
control
of
this
policy
and
the
fact
that
we
knew
exactly
what
we
were
doing.
and
in
addition,
encouraged
the
puerto
ricans
to
come
over
to
the
mainland
was
a
responsibility
that
congress
recognized
in
considering
whether
or
not
it
would
adopt
4
(e).
and
the
fact
that
puerto
ricans
have
come
to
the
mainland
particularly
to
new
york
city
and
nearby
areas
in
large
numbers,
is
likewise
attributable
to
congress.
they
have
even
charged
by
the
treaty
of
cession
with
determination
of
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
the
people
in
puerto
rico
granted
them
their
citizenship
as
far
back
in
1917.
after
that,
this
was
when
they
encouraged
them
to
come
to
the
mainland.
the
upshot
is
that
congress
is
largely
responsible
for
the
present
predicament
of
puerto
ricans
residing
in
the
states
who
are
educated
and
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
but
who
are
denied
the
voice
in
the
political
process
solely
because
they
do
not
read
and
write
english.
it
was
therefore
quite
natural
that
congress
should
feel
a
moral
obligation
to
remedy
a
problem
of
its
own
making
when
the
affected
states
declined
to
solve
it
themselves,
and
new
york
refused
to
it
even
though
several
bills
were
introduced
in
the
last
few
years.
the
legislative
history,
i
submit,
is
clear
that
congress
acted
in
this
exact
spirit.
now
the
effect
of
the
legislation
is
simply
this.
section
4
(e)
does
not
overwrite
the
state
literacy
laws
even
for
puerto
ricans.
insofar
as
the
state
choose
to
limit
their
electorate
to
those
who
demonstrate
by
educational
achievement
the
requisite
intelligence
and
knowledge
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process.
section
4
(e)
respects
that.
in
a
moment,
we'll
take
up
the
one
arguable
point
objection
that
it
permits
voting
by
persons,
of
course,
he
cannot
read
and
write,
cannot
keep
abreast
of
what's
going
on.
indeed
section
4
(e)
does
--
opposes
no
serious
administrative
problems
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
new
york
state.
this
law,
4
(e),
was
tailored
to
the
law
of
new
york,
which
was
the
most
directly
affected
state.
no
spanish
literacy
test
is
required
to
be
administered
and
new
york
doesn't
have
to
workout
a
test
or
anything.
the
spanish
speaking
puerto
ricans
are
permitted
to
prove
their
literacy
only
by
demonstrating
but
they've
completed
the
sixth
grade,
which
is
the
same
grade
incidentally
in
english,
in
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
section
4
(e)
has
an
appreciable
impact
in
only
parts
of
four
other
states
--
three
other
states;
california,
connecticut,
and
massachusetts.
and
there
it
does
not
produce
any
uninformed
voters.
although
19
states
have
some
kind
of
english
literacy
qualification
for
voting,
only
the
four
name
have
a
puerto
rican
population
exceeding
5000.
when
there
is
a
substantial
spanish
speaking
population,
there
are
also
as
one
would
expect
spanish
language
newspapers
and
radio,
and
television
programs
to
inform
that
growth.
for
example,
in
new
york,
there
are
three
old
spanish
newspapers.
there
are
three
old
spanish
radio
stations.
there
are
indeed
spanish
speaking
television
programs.
and
although
it's
not
directly
involved
in
this
case,
we
show
that
in
california,
there's
one
wholly
spanish
daily
newspaper,
two
other
parts
spanish
weeklies,
68
radio
stations
with
some
spanish
language
programs
including
five
wholly
devoted
to
spanish.
and
the
political
candidates
in
affidavits
clearly
in
the
record
show
that
there
had
not
any
difficulty
in
getting
a
story
over
to
spanish-speaking
people
either
in
new
york
or
connecticut
or
indeed
in
texas
and
california.
thus,
as
i
see
it,
section
4
(e)
works
only
a
slight
impingement
on
state
voting
qualifications.
it
is
not
in
exercise
of
federal
power
writing
raw
shot
over
local
laws
but
rather
a
careful
and
reasonable
accommodation
that
respects
in
every
possible
way,
legitimate
local
preferences.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
the
ballots
would
be
in
the
same
language.
their
ballots
have
been
in
english.
it's
not
been
changed
in
the
ballots
at
all.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
they
can
read
the
names.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
and
they
can
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
the
constitutional
amendments
are
only
brief
--
the
whole
amendment
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
the
--
the
part
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
informed
voter
reads
the
constitutional
amendment
some
place
outside
of
the
booth
before
he
goes
in
it.
and
the
spanish
speaking
literate
person
would
read
it
in
spanish.
and
if
he
decided
that
he
was
in
favor
of
proposal
number
one,
he
would
pull
to
leave
it
down,
yes
on
one
because
one
is
the
same
in
spanish
as
it
is
in
english,
the
figure
1.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
don't
know
of
any
place
where
they
have
dual
ballot
system.
they
--
for
example
in
puerto
rico,
they
do.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
don't
know
sir.
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
that
the
whole
question
of
the
intelligent
voter
is
the
study
he
makes
before
he
goes
into
polling
booth.
and
he
has
access
to
the
spanish
speaking
newspapers.
and
they
would
do
the
same
thing
as
the
english
speaking
newspapers.
they
will
perfectly.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
i
--
i
--
it
pairs
to
me
that
congress
was
very
hesitant
of
putting
any
burden
on
the
state.
that
would
require
the
state
to
do
something
more
for
the
spanish
speaking
citizen
than
for
the
english
speaking
citizen.
and
it's
up
to
the
spanish
speaking
citizen
to
get
his
information
from
spanish
speaking
sources.
and
if
the
affidavit
is
all
showing
in
the
record
that
in
areas
where
they
have
large
spanish
speaking
population,
the
candidates
find
a
way
of
getting
their
story
over
by
putting
it
to
advertisement
and
et
cetera
in
the
newspapers.
so
i
think
as
of
today,
i
don't
know
about
years
ago,
but
as
of
today,
the
spanish
speaking
citizen
could
be
just
as
well
advised
as
to
english.
they
rely
on
their
newspapers,
i
imagine,
and
they
rely
on
their
radio
and
television
station
just
like
so
many
of
our
voters
do.
in
the
--
on
the
question
of
the
power
of
congress,
in
the
absence
of
prohibitory
federal
legislation,
it
is
of
course
clear
that
the
states
may
condition
the
right
to
vote
upon
reasonable
literacy
tests
if
they
do
not
discriminate
against
the
class.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
equally
well
settled
that
states
do
not
have
an
absolute
prerogative
to
regulate
the
franchise
as
they
see
fit.
their
right
to
fix
voting
qualifications
is
subject
to
constitutional
limitations.
and
it
could
be
no
question
about
it
now
when
we
look
at
carrington
and
rash,
louisiana
state,
harper
against
virginia,
and
more
recently
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
the
only
question
is
whether
assuming
new
york's
rule
is
otherwise
constitutional
congress
nevertheless
has
power
to
qualify
it
in
the
prevailing
circumstances
of
the
people
that
have
come
from
puerto
rico.
we
find
such
power
in
both
of
the
provisions.
one,
that
territorial
clause
i
mentioned
a
while
ago
and
two,
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
we
believe
that
the
two
should
not
be
considered
separately
but
we
will
prefer
to
view
them
as
complimentary
one
from
the
other.
there
is
no
question
that
puerto
rico
was
a
territory
in
the
full
sense
until
at
least
1952.
and
during
that
time
that
this
court
has
said
the
power
of
congress
was
the
broadest
possible,
indeed,
it
was
plenary,
i
don't
care
whether
you
use
the
word
plenary
or
not,
but
it
certainly
was
full.
and
that
during
that
happened
in
the
century
was
done
pursuant
to
the
territorial
clause
including
the
establishment
of
the
spanish
educational
policy.
congress
gave
them
to
grant
of
citizenship
and
finally
the
grant
of
commonwealth
status.
accordingly,
it
seems
wholly
appropriate
now
to
invoke
the
same
source
of
power,
congress
to
carry
out
a
policy
undertaken
in
the
old
territorial
days
of
puerto
rico
by
granting
puerto
ricans
the
immunity
from
discrimination
in
voting
on
account
of
their
language.
and
that
resolving
the
modern
problem
affect
state
laws
in
a
modest
ways
no
absolute
obstacle.
in
this
respect,
it
seems
to
us
that
territorial
powers
like
the
power
to
implement
treaty
obligations
which
clearly
may
override
contrary
state
laws,
nor
is
it
a
sound
objection
that
puerto
rico
today
are
commonwealth,
certainly
it's
a
commonwealth.
the
court
need
not
resolve
the
exact
status
of
puerto
rico
vis-à-vis
commonwealth
status.
for
present
purposes,
it
is
enough
that
puerto
rico
is
not
an
independent
nation
and
that
section
4
(e)
does
not
in
the
least
impinge
on
puerto
rico's
right
of
self-government.
surely,
the
subsisting
force
of
a
territorial
clause
with
respect
to
puerto
rico
is
sufficient
to
authorize
this
winding
up
of
the
puerto
rican
problem
on
the
mainland.
and
now
on
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
emphasize
we
would
appreciate
consideration
of
the
two
priorities
together.
we
think
that
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
congress
certainly
had
the
power
to
pass
4
(e).
and
we
point
out
in
quite
detail
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
early
post
civil
war
legislation
of
congress
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
all
indicate
that
congress
has
power,
sometimes
a
duty,
to
determine
the
content
of
equal
protection,
and
that
courts
are
bound
to
respect
such
determinations
within
proper
limits.
even
if
independently
they
could
not
invalidate
the
inconsistent
state
laws.
we
submit
this
is
a
peculiarly
appropriate
application
of
that
principle.
here,
congress
is
effectuating
its
policy
and
correcting
a
situation
of
its
own
creation.
here,
congress
is
protecting
its
formal
words
toward
whom
it
has
special
responsibilities.
here,
congress
is
dealing
with
the
subject
matter,
the
electoral
process
which
is
certainly
clearly
within
its
area
of
special
comments.
we
submit
that
judge
mcgowan
dissenting
below
and
the
three-judge
court
in
the
companion
monroe-kelly
case
through
judge
kaufmann
were
correct.
the
constitutional
challenge
to
4
(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
must
be
rejected.
the
majority
opinion
below
and
indeed
the
appellees
in
this
court
insist
that
the
lassiter
case
is
the
absolute
authority
for
the
protection
of
the
new
york
law.
and
i
just
went
over
the
lassiter
case
again
and
i
found
the
word
‘english'
in
one
spot,
and
that
was
in
the
footnote
quoted
in
the
statute.
there
was
no
question
in
lassiter
about
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
in
that
case
could
speak
english.
let's
assume
that
if
the
petitioner
was
born
and
raised
in
north
carolina
that
has
a
compulsory
educational
system,
they
could
speak
english.
the
lassiter
case
merely
passed
on
the
question
of
a
literacy
test.
and
in
new
york,
new
york
still
has
the
same
protection
on
literacy
with
or
without
4
(e).
if
the
person
is
born
and
raised
in
puerto
rico
in
order
to
vote,
that
person
must
be
as
literate
as
the
english
speaking
applicant.
both
have
to
show
at
least
a
sixth-grade
certificate
in
a
recognized
school
one
being
spanish
and
the
other
being
english.
i
believe
further
as
judge
kaufman
said
in
the
monroe
county
case
that
congress
set
out
to
eliminate
all
vestiges
of
discrimination
into
voting
process.
congress
dealt
appropriately
with
the
problem
in
the
south
insofar
as
a
negro
was
concerned.
and
once
advised
of
the
problem
in
new
york,
congress
sought
to
complete
the
job
and
make
certain
that
people
who
were
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
who
were
brought
up
in
spanish
speaking
areas
on
the
territory
of
the
united
states
that
they
in
turn
should
not
be
discriminated
against
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
they
could
not
speak
and
write
and
understand
english
as
such.
if
i
could
save
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
obliged
to
point
as
i
did
in
the
beginning
that
we
are
not
trying
to
have
the
new
york
literacy
test
declared
unconstitutional.
they
still
will
keep
their
literacy
test
and
4
(e)
allows
for
the
exact
same
test,
the
only
difference
is
the
language
points.
and
secondly,
on
the
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
what
congress
was
thinking
about,
in
our
brief
on
pages
14
and
15,
we
point
out
the
sponsors
in
the
bill
senators
kennedy
and
javits
and
in
the
house
of
representatives
ryan
and
gilbert,
in
which
they
set
forth
the
same
thing
we're
talking
about
in
our
brief
about
the
fact
that
congress
itself
sustained
the
education
in
spanish,
sustained
it
over
a
period
of
years.
he
gave
them
citizenship
and
then
brought
them
over
to
the
mainland
and
urged
them
on.
so
congress
did
consider
the
treaty
point
as
well
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
point.
secondly,
this
is
not
the
only
provision
of
the
voting
rights
bill
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
provision
as
to
the
poll
tax
if
you
remember
was
also
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
on
the
question
of
the
abandonment
of
english
in
the
schools
of
puerto
rico
was
the
commissioner
appointed
by
our
government
that
originally
decided
that
it
couldn't
be
done
any
longer
and
so
it
was
actually
our
government
that
took
responsibility
for
it.
i
think
that
the
one
point
that's
significant
in
the
opposition
here
today
is
that
they
make
no
basis
of
justification
for
the
requirement
that
the
literacy
test
be
held
in
english.
i've
heard
no
argument
or
whatsoever
about
it
except
the
state
of
new
york
which
says
that
this
will
be
a
stimulus
to
get
the
puerto
ricans
to
learn
english.
that's
a
very
interesting
proposition
because
it
would
appear
to
me
that
getting
the
right
to
vote
and
being
able
to
participate
in
the
municipal
elections
might
bring
about
a
little
more
employment
and
a
little
more
schooling
and
the
few
other
items
--
i
completely
lost
on
that.
finally,
to
make
our
position
clear,
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
despite
what
has
been
said
here
that
the
only
rights
we
have
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
the
civil
rights
that
were
recognized
in
1866
is
almost
unbelievable
argument
to
be
made
today.
and
i
was
also
most
interested
since
some
have
been
doing
delving
in
these
debates
that
the
equal
protection
clause
was
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
chinese
people
in
san
francisco.
and
i
don't
believe
i
remember
a
single
one
of
the
cases
that
interpreted
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
slaughterhouse
through
plessy
against
ferguson
that
had
anything
to
say
about
the
chinese
in
san
francisco
to
the
contrary
this
court
says
over
and
over
again
what
the
purpose
of
the
equal
protection
clause
was
for
was
to
protect
the
newly
freed
slaves.
we
say
that
congress
with
its
power
recognized
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
drew
upon
its
knowledge
of
what
it
had
happened
as
a
result
of
the
action
of
congress
in
regard
to
puerto
rico
and
realized
that
there
were
over
700,000
american
citizens
in
new
york
in
its
vicinity.
and
a
large
proportion
of
them
unable
to
speak
english
but
literate
otherwise
were
being
denied
the
right
to
vote
and
with
the
least
friction
against
the
state
fashioned
the
provision
that
would
not
in
any
way
injure
the
state
of
new
york
or
its
right
to
require
that
its
voters
be
literate
and
to
pass
4
(e)
and
it
to
be
applied.
i
believe
that
the
question
of
the
right
of
congress
to
legislate
in
this
area
has
been
so
often
passed
upon
by
this
court
that
we
do
not
have
to
worry
about
that
point.
and
secondly,
that
what
they
did
was
reasonable,
was
required
and
therefore
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
the
real
problem
is
the
statements
have
come
out
in
the
debates
which
sort
of
went
to
the
conscience
of
congress.
i
don't
think
they
should
be
completely
ignored.
but
it's
my
understanding
under
at
least
two
opinions
in
the
guest
case
that
the
fifth
--
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
gives
congress
sufficient
authorization
to
find
what
they
themselves
determine
to
be
a
violation
of
the
first
section.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
i
don't
take
that
position
at
all.
i
think
this
court
eventually
passes
upon
the
authority
of
congress
to
act.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
i
think
then
you'd
have
to
find
out
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was.
but
i
--
the
ultimate
part
(voice
overlap)
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
as
far
back
as
chief
justice
marshall
is
in
this
court.
this
court
has
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
recognized
that
when
they
made
a
specific
provision
of
the
--
for
the
three-judge
court
to
try
originally
in
the
constitutionality
of
this
bill.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
civil
rights
cases
went
off
a
little
long
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
don't
know
sir.
i
don't
know
of
one.
i'm
not
saying
there
aren't.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
treaty
of
paris.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir
it's
the
--
the
provision
itself
is
in
the
early
part
of
our
brief.
the
congress
hereby
declares
that
to
secure
the
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
persons
who
don't
agree
said
nothing
about
race
at
all.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
not
on
the
basis
of
their
color.
and
although
the
figures
were
made
by
mrs.
coons
about
some
percentage
of
puerto
ricans
who
come
to
new
york
are
white,
i
understood
that
every
puerto
rican
was
white.
there's
no
difference.
it's
my
understanding.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
they
are
not
classified
as
negroes.
they
just
don't
recognize
color
as
a
basis
of
distinction.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
i
should
assume
so.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
i
just
say
mr.
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
--
justice
stewart,
reciting
the
record
i've
dealt
with
them
and
they
tell
you
right
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
--
i'm
either
american
or
puerto
rican
but
don't
call
me
a
negro.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
wouldn't
doubt
it.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
pleasant
work.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make.
may
it
please
the
court,
is
on
the
question
of
the
enlistment
and
the
draft
and
the
test
in
the
army,
the
attorney
general
of
puerto
rico
advises
me
that
they
take
the
spanish
test
and
then
they
take
the
english
test
but
if
they
fail
the
english
test,
they
are
not
discarded,
they
are
put
in
a
special
classification
solely
on
the
grounds
that
they
speak
spanish
over
it.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes,
they
are
inducted.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
they
are
inducted.
it's
the
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
under
a
special
classification.
no
further
questions
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
--
highly
relevant.
we
view
the
statute
only
as
it
bears
on
american
citizens
now
residing
on
the
mainland
who
are
educated
in
spanish
language
schools
in
puerto
rico.
and
it's
the
only
question
presented
by
this
case,
and
it
is
as
a
practical
matter,
probably
the
only
application
of
section
4
(e)
that
will
ever
arise.
we
first
rely
on
article
4,
section
3
of
our
constitution
which
provides,
“that
congress
shall
have
power
to
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
respecting
the
territory
belonging
to
the
united
states”.
and
the
treaty
of
paris
in
1898
by
which
puerto
rico
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
provides
specifically
at
the
civil
rights
and
political
status
of
the
native
inhabitants
of
puerto
rico
shall
be
determined
by
congress.
and
this
was
implemented
over
and
over
again
by
granting
citizenship
in
1917
to
the
residents
of
that
territory.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
is
now
powerless
to
effectuate
its
policy
with
respect
to
puerto
ricans
who
moved
to
the
mainland
by
providing
a
shield
against
state
laws
which
disqualify
them
from
voting.
and
getting
to
this,
i
emphasize
two
points.
the
fact
that
spanish
yesterday
and
has
for
several
decades
been
the
language
of
instruction
in
puerto
rican
schools,
is
ultimately
directly
attributable
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
which
while
it
had
direct
control
of
the
educational
policy
of
puerto
rico,
did
make
a
slight
effort
to
impose
english
as
a
predominant
language
but
abandoned
that
effort.
and
with
the
knowledge
of
the
consequences,
gave
the
control
to
locally
elected
officials
knowing
full
well
that
those
officials
would
continue
to
use
spanish
as
the
language
in
schools.
and
in
1952,
the
agreement
was
made
and
so
as
of
that
date
on,
there
was
no
question
that
congress
deliberately
set
upon
the
path
of
having
spanish
to
be
the
language
spoken
in
the
puerto
rican
public
schools.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
they
were
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
it
was
when
we
had
charge
of
it
back
in
the
--
after
the
jones
act.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
we
tried
to
get
them
to
put
in
english
of
the
predominant
language.
and
the
reports
came
back,
i
don't
remember
the
exact
date
but
the
reports
came
back
that
would
--
dissented
in
1946
but
the
reports
came
back
that
it
was
not
working.
you
couldn't
establish
a
bilingual
school
system
because
the
large
percentage
of
the
community,
the
home
and
everything
spoke
spanish,
and
the
only
time
the
youngsters
spoke
english
was
in
school.
and
so
they've
just
abandoned
it.
they
did
make
some
people
say,
“i
have
hardly
attempt”,
but
an
attempt
was
made.
and
in
1946,
it
was
just
abandoned
completely.
and
finally
in
1952,
we
get
to
the
point
of
the
absolute
freedom.
the
fact
that
we
had
control
of
this
policy
and
the
fact
that
we
knew
exactly
what
we
were
doing.
and
in
addition,
encouraged
the
puerto
ricans
to
come
over
to
the
mainland
was
a
responsibility
that
congress
recognized
in
considering
whether
or
not
it
would
adopt
4
(e).
and
the
fact
that
puerto
ricans
have
come
to
the
mainland
particularly
to
new
york
city
and
nearby
areas
in
large
numbers,
is
likewise
attributable
to
congress.
they
have
even
charged
by
the
treaty
of
cession
with
determination
of
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
the
people
in
puerto
rico
granted
them
their
citizenship
as
far
back
in
1917.
after
that,
this
was
when
they
encouraged
them
to
come
to
the
mainland.
the
upshot
is
that
congress
is
largely
responsible
for
the
present
predicament
of
puerto
ricans
residing
in
the
states
who
are
educated
and
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
but
who
are
denied
the
voice
in
the
political
process
solely
because
they
do
not
read
and
write
english.
it
was
therefore
quite
natural
that
congress
should
feel
a
moral
obligation
to
remedy
a
problem
of
its
own
making
when
the
affected
states
declined
to
solve
it
themselves,
and
new
york
refused
to
it
even
though
several
bills
were
introduced
in
the
last
few
years.
the
legislative
history,
i
submit,
is
clear
that
congress
acted
in
this
exact
spirit.
now
the
effect
of
the
legislation
is
simply
this.
section
4
(e)
does
not
overwrite
the
state
literacy
laws
even
for
puerto
ricans.
insofar
as
the
state
choose
to
limit
their
electorate
to
those
who
demonstrate
by
educational
achievement
the
requisite
intelligence
and
knowledge
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process.
section
4
(e)
respects
that.
in
a
moment,
we'll
take
up
the
one
arguable
point
objection
that
it
permits
voting
by
persons,
of
course,
he
cannot
read
and
write,
cannot
keep
abreast
of
what's
going
on.
indeed
section
4
(e)
does
--
opposes
no
serious
administrative
problems
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
new
york
state.
this
law,
4
(e),
was
tailored
to
the
law
of
new
york,
which
was
the
most
directly
affected
state.
no
spanish
literacy
test
is
required
to
be
administered
and
new
york
doesn't
have
to
workout
a
test
or
anything.
the
spanish
speaking
puerto
ricans
are
permitted
to
prove
their
literacy
only
by
demonstrating
but
they've
completed
the
sixth
grade,
which
is
the
same
grade
incidentally
in
english,
in
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
section
4
(e)
has
an
appreciable
impact
in
only
parts
of
four
other
states
--
three
other
states;
california,
connecticut,
and
massachusetts.
and
there
it
does
not
produce
any
uninformed
voters.
although
19
states
have
some
kind
of
english
literacy
qualification
for
voting,
only
the
four
name
have
a
puerto
rican
population
exceeding
5000.
when
there
is
a
substantial
spanish
speaking
population,
there
are
also
as
one
would
expect
spanish
language
newspapers
and
radio,
and
television
programs
to
inform
that
growth.
for
example,
in
new
york,
there
are
three
old
spanish
newspapers.
there
are
three
old
spanish
radio
stations.
there
are
indeed
spanish
speaking
television
programs.
and
although
it's
not
directly
involved
in
this
case,
we
show
that
in
california,
there's
one
wholly
spanish
daily
newspaper,
two
other
parts
spanish
weeklies,
68
radio
stations
with
some
spanish
language
programs
including
five
wholly
devoted
to
spanish.
and
the
political
candidates
in
affidavits
clearly
in
the
record
show
that
there
had
not
any
difficulty
in
getting
a
story
over
to
spanish-speaking
people
either
in
new
york
or
connecticut
or
indeed
in
texas
and
california.
thus,
as
i
see
it,
section
4
(e)
works
only
a
slight
impingement
on
state
voting
qualifications.
it
is
not
in
exercise
of
federal
power
writing
raw
shot
over
local
laws
but
rather
a
careful
and
reasonable
accommodation
that
respects
in
every
possible
way,
legitimate
local
preferences.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
the
ballots
would
be
in
the
same
language.
their
ballots
have
been
in
english.
it's
not
been
changed
in
the
ballots
at
all.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
they
can
read
the
names.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
and
they
can
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
the
constitutional
amendments
are
only
brief
--
the
whole
amendment
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
the
--
the
part
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
informed
voter
reads
the
constitutional
amendment
some
place
outside
of
the
booth
before
he
goes
in
it.
and
the
spanish
speaking
literate
person
would
read
it
in
spanish.
and
if
he
decided
that
he
was
in
favor
of
proposal
number
one,
he
would
pull
to
leave
it
down,
yes
on
one
because
one
is
the
same
in
spanish
as
it
is
in
english,
the
figure
1.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
don't
know
of
any
place
where
they
have
dual
ballot
system.
they
--
for
example
in
puerto
rico,
they
do.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
don't
know
sir.
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
that
the
whole
question
of
the
intelligent
voter
is
the
study
he
makes
before
he
goes
into
polling
booth.
and
he
has
access
to
the
spanish
speaking
newspapers.
and
they
would
do
the
same
thing
as
the
english
speaking
newspapers.
they
will
perfectly.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
i
--
i
--
it
pairs
to
me
that
congress
was
very
hesitant
of
putting
any
burden
on
the
state.
that
would
require
the
state
to
do
something
more
for
the
spanish
speaking
citizen
than
for
the
english
speaking
citizen.
and
it's
up
to
the
spanish
speaking
citizen
to
get
his
information
from
spanish
speaking
sources.
and
if
the
affidavit
is
all
showing
in
the
record
that
in
areas
where
they
have
large
spanish
speaking
population,
the
candidates
find
a
way
of
getting
their
story
over
by
putting
it
to
advertisement
and
et
cetera
in
the
newspapers.
so
i
think
as
of
today,
i
don't
know
about
years
ago,
but
as
of
today,
the
spanish
speaking
citizen
could
be
just
as
well
advised
as
to
english.
they
rely
on
their
newspapers,
i
imagine,
and
they
rely
on
their
radio
and
television
station
just
like
so
many
of
our
voters
do.
in
the
--
on
the
question
of
the
power
of
congress,
in
the
absence
of
prohibitory
federal
legislation,
it
is
of
course
clear
that
the
states
may
condition
the
right
to
vote
upon
reasonable
literacy
tests
if
they
do
not
discriminate
against
the
class.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
equally
well
settled
that
states
do
not
have
an
absolute
prerogative
to
regulate
the
franchise
as
they
see
fit.
their
right
to
fix
voting
qualifications
is
subject
to
constitutional
limitations.
and
it
could
be
no
question
about
it
now
when
we
look
at
carrington
and
rash,
louisiana
state,
harper
against
virginia,
and
more
recently
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
the
only
question
is
whether
assuming
new
york's
rule
is
otherwise
constitutional
congress
nevertheless
has
power
to
qualify
it
in
the
prevailing
circumstances
of
the
people
that
have
come
from
puerto
rico.
we
find
such
power
in
both
of
the
provisions.
one,
that
territorial
clause
i
mentioned
a
while
ago
and
two,
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
we
believe
that
the
two
should
not
be
considered
separately
but
we
will
prefer
to
view
them
as
complimentary
one
from
the
other.
there
is
no
question
that
puerto
rico
was
a
territory
in
the
full
sense
until
at
least
1952.
and
during
that
time
that
this
court
has
said
the
power
of
congress
was
the
broadest
possible,
indeed,
it
was
plenary,
i
don't
care
whether
you
use
the
word
plenary
or
not,
but
it
certainly
was
full.
and
that
during
that
happened
in
the
century
was
done
pursuant
to
the
territorial
clause
including
the
establishment
of
the
spanish
educational
policy.
congress
gave
them
to
grant
of
citizenship
and
finally
the
grant
of
commonwealth
status.
accordingly,
it
seems
wholly
appropriate
now
to
invoke
the
same
source
of
power,
congress
to
carry
out
a
policy
undertaken
in
the
old
territorial
days
of
puerto
rico
by
granting
puerto
ricans
the
immunity
from
discrimination
in
voting
on
account
of
their
language.
and
that
resolving
the
modern
problem
affect
state
laws
in
a
modest
ways
no
absolute
obstacle.
in
this
respect,
it
seems
to
us
that
territorial
powers
like
the
power
to
implement
treaty
obligations
which
clearly
may
override
contrary
state
laws,
nor
is
it
a
sound
objection
that
puerto
rico
today
are
commonwealth,
certainly
it's
a
commonwealth.
the
court
need
not
resolve
the
exact
status
of
puerto
rico
vis-à-vis
commonwealth
status.
for
present
purposes,
it
is
enough
that
puerto
rico
is
not
an
independent
nation
and
that
section
4
(e)
does
not
in
the
least
impinge
on
puerto
rico's
right
of
self-government.
surely,
the
subsisting
force
of
a
territorial
clause
with
respect
to
puerto
rico
is
sufficient
to
authorize
this
winding
up
of
the
puerto
rican
problem
on
the
mainland.
and
now
on
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
emphasize
we
would
appreciate
consideration
of
the
two
priorities
together.
we
think
that
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
congress
certainly
had
the
power
to
pass
4
(e).
and
we
point
out
in
quite
detail
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
early
post
civil
war
legislation
of
congress
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
all
indicate
that
congress
has
power,
sometimes
a
duty,
to
determine
the
content
of
equal
protection,
and
that
courts
are
bound
to
respect
such
determinations
within
proper
limits.
even
if
independently
they
could
not
invalidate
the
inconsistent
state
laws.
we
submit
this
is
a
peculiarly
appropriate
application
of
that
principle.
here,
congress
is
effectuating
its
policy
and
correcting
a
situation
of
its
own
creation.
here,
congress
is
protecting
its
formal
words
toward
whom
it
has
special
responsibilities.
here,
congress
is
dealing
with
the
subject
matter,
the
electoral
process
which
is
certainly
clearly
within
its
area
of
special
comments.
we
submit
that
judge
mcgowan
dissenting
below
and
the
three-judge
court
in
the
companion
monroe-kelly
case
through
judge
kaufmann
were
correct.
the
constitutional
challenge
to
4
(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
must
be
rejected.
the
majority
opinion
below
and
indeed
the
appellees
in
this
court
insist
that
the
lassiter
case
is
the
absolute
authority
for
the
protection
of
the
new
york
law.
and
i
just
went
over
the
lassiter
case
again
and
i
found
the
word
‘english'
in
one
spot,
and
that
was
in
the
footnote
quoted
in
the
statute.
there
was
no
question
in
lassiter
about
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
in
that
case
could
speak
english.
let's
assume
that
if
the
petitioner
was
born
and
raised
in
north
carolina
that
has
a
compulsory
educational
system,
they
could
speak
english.
the
lassiter
case
merely
passed
on
the
question
of
a
literacy
test.
and
in
new
york,
new
york
still
has
the
same
protection
on
literacy
with
or
without
4
(e).
if
the
person
is
born
and
raised
in
puerto
rico
in
order
to
vote,
that
person
must
be
as
literate
as
the
english
speaking
applicant.
both
have
to
show
at
least
a
sixth-grade
certificate
in
a
recognized
school
one
being
spanish
and
the
other
being
english.
i
believe
further
as
judge
kaufman
said
in
the
monroe
county
case
that
congress
set
out
to
eliminate
all
vestiges
of
discrimination
into
voting
process.
congress
dealt
appropriately
with
the
problem
in
the
south
insofar
as
a
negro
was
concerned.
and
once
advised
of
the
problem
in
new
york,
congress
sought
to
complete
the
job
and
make
certain
that
people
who
were
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
who
were
brought
up
in
spanish
speaking
areas
on
the
territory
of
the
united
states
that
they
in
turn
should
not
be
discriminated
against
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
they
could
not
speak
and
write
and
understand
english
as
such.
if
i
could
save
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
obliged
to
point
as
i
did
in
the
beginning
that
we
are
not
trying
to
have
the
new
york
literacy
test
declared
unconstitutional.
they
still
will
keep
their
literacy
test
and
4
(e)
allows
for
the
exact
same
test,
the
only
difference
is
the
language
points.
and
secondly,
on
the
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
what
congress
was
thinking
about,
in
our
brief
on
pages
14
and
15,
we
point
out
the
sponsors
in
the
bill
senators
kennedy
and
javits
and
in
the
house
of
representatives
ryan
and
gilbert,
in
which
they
set
forth
the
same
thing
we're
talking
about
in
our
brief
about
the
fact
that
congress
itself
sustained
the
education
in
spanish,
sustained
it
over
a
period
of
years.
he
gave
them
citizenship
and
then
brought
them
over
to
the
mainland
and
urged
them
on.
so
congress
did
consider
the
treaty
point
as
well
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
point.
secondly,
this
is
not
the
only
provision
of
the
voting
rights
bill
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
provision
as
to
the
poll
tax
if
you
remember
was
also
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
on
the
question
of
the
abandonment
of
english
in
the
schools
of
puerto
rico
was
the
commissioner
appointed
by
our
government
that
originally
decided
that
it
couldn't
be
done
any
longer
and
so
it
was
actually
our
government
that
took
responsibility
for
it.
i
think
that
the
one
point
that's
significant
in
the
opposition
here
today
is
that
they
make
no
basis
of
justification
for
the
requirement
that
the
literacy
test
be
held
in
english.
i've
heard
no
argument
or
whatsoever
about
it
except
the
state
of
new
york
which
says
that
this
will
be
a
stimulus
to
get
the
puerto
ricans
to
learn
english.
that's
a
very
interesting
proposition
because
it
would
appear
to
me
that
getting
the
right
to
vote
and
being
able
to
participate
in
the
municipal
elections
might
bring
about
a
little
more
employment
and
a
little
more
schooling
and
the
few
other
items
--
i
completely
lost
on
that.
finally,
to
make
our
position
clear,
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
despite
what
has
been
said
here
that
the
only
rights
we
have
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
the
civil
rights
that
were
recognized
in
1866
is
almost
unbelievable
argument
to
be
made
today.
and
i
was
also
most
interested
since
some
have
been
doing
delving
in
these
debates
that
the
equal
protection
clause
was
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
chinese
people
in
san
francisco.
and
i
don't
believe
i
remember
a
single
one
of
the
cases
that
interpreted
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
slaughterhouse
through
plessy
against
ferguson
that
had
anything
to
say
about
the
chinese
in
san
francisco
to
the
contrary
this
court
says
over
and
over
again
what
the
purpose
of
the
equal
protection
clause
was
for
was
to
protect
the
newly
freed
slaves.
we
say
that
congress
with
its
power
recognized
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
drew
upon
its
knowledge
of
what
it
had
happened
as
a
result
of
the
action
of
congress
in
regard
to
puerto
rico
and
realized
that
there
were
over
700,000
american
citizens
in
new
york
in
its
vicinity.
and
a
large
proportion
of
them
unable
to
speak
english
but
literate
otherwise
were
being
denied
the
right
to
vote
and
with
the
least
friction
against
the
state
fashioned
the
provision
that
would
not
in
any
way
injure
the
state
of
new
york
or
its
right
to
require
that
its
voters
be
literate
and
to
pass
4
(e)
and
it
to
be
applied.
i
believe
that
the
question
of
the
right
of
congress
to
legislate
in
this
area
has
been
so
often
passed
upon
by
this
court
that
we
do
not
have
to
worry
about
that
point.
and
secondly,
that
what
they
did
was
reasonable,
was
required
and
therefore
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
the
real
problem
is
the
statements
have
come
out
in
the
debates
which
sort
of
went
to
the
conscience
of
congress.
i
don't
think
they
should
be
completely
ignored.
but
it's
my
understanding
under
at
least
two
opinions
in
the
guest
case
that
the
fifth
--
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
gives
congress
sufficient
authorization
to
find
what
they
themselves
determine
to
be
a
violation
of
the
first
section.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
i
don't
take
that
position
at
all.
i
think
this
court
eventually
passes
upon
the
authority
of
congress
to
act.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
i
think
then
you'd
have
to
find
out
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was.
but
i
--
the
ultimate
part
(voice
overlap)
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
as
far
back
as
chief
justice
marshall
is
in
this
court.
this
court
has
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
recognized
that
when
they
made
a
specific
provision
of
the
--
for
the
three-judge
court
to
try
originally
in
the
constitutionality
of
this
bill.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
civil
rights
cases
went
off
a
little
long
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
don't
know
sir.
i
don't
know
of
one.
i'm
not
saying
there
aren't.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
treaty
of
paris.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir
it's
the
--
the
provision
itself
is
in
the
early
part
of
our
brief.
the
congress
hereby
declares
that
to
secure
the
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
persons
who
don't
agree
said
nothing
about
race
at
all.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
not
on
the
basis
of
their
color.
and
although
the
figures
were
made
by
mrs.
coons
about
some
percentage
of
puerto
ricans
who
come
to
new
york
are
white,
i
understood
that
every
puerto
rican
was
white.
there's
no
difference.
it's
my
understanding.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
they
are
not
classified
as
negroes.
they
just
don't
recognize
color
as
a
basis
of
distinction.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
i
should
assume
so.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well
i
just
say
mr.
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
--
justice
stewart,
reciting
the
record
i've
dealt
with
them
and
they
tell
you
right
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
--
i'm
either
american
or
puerto
rican
but
don't
call
me
a
negro.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
wouldn't
doubt
it.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
pleasant
work.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make.
may
it
please
the
court,
is
on
the
question
of
the
enlistment
and
the
draft
and
the
test
in
the
army,
the
attorney
general
of
puerto
rico
advises
me
that
they
take
the
spanish
test
and
then
they
take
the
english
test
but
if
they
fail
the
english
test,
they
are
not
discarded,
they
are
put
in
a
special
classification
solely
on
the
grounds
that
they
speak
spanish
over
it.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes,
they
are
inducted.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
they
are
inducted.
it's
the
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
under
a
special
classification.
no
further
questions
--
