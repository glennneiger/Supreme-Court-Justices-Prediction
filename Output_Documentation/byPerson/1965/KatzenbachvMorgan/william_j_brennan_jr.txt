justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rankin,
may
i
ask,
insofar
as
your
argument
rests
on
the
territorial
clause,
do
we
have
a
problem
here
in
the
fact
that
4
(e)
is
not
a
regulation
of
anything
within
the
borders
of
puerto
rico
but
it's
a
regulation
of
voting
within
the
state
of
new
york.
is
the
territorial
clause
in
any
respect
a
limitation
to
the
regulation
of
the
internal
affairs
of
the
territories?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
we
--
have
we
ever
been
confronted
with
that
precise
question
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
with
the
boyd
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
--
i
think
you
also
argued,
am
i
right
with
your
argument,
independently
of
the
territorial
clause,
there
is
a
source
of
congressional
authority
for
4
(e)
in
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
standing
alone,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
do
i
correctly
understand
that
that
goes
something
like
this
that
the
purpose
of
the
literacy
requirements
limited
as
they
are
to
sixth
grade
education,
is
largely
to
give
some
assurance
that
a
voter
will
intelligently
approaches
responsibility
as
to
vote.
and
that
if
this
may
be
as
true
of
the
spanish
speaking
voter
as
of
the
english
speaking
voter,
then
congress
may
denounce
as
discriminatory
under
the
equal
protection
clause
whether
or
not
this
court
could
independently,
could
say
that
the
clause
independently
did
this.
that
congress
at
least
under
section
5
can
denounce
that
as
discriminatory
if
it
finds
that
indeed
the
sixth
grade
spanish-speaking
education
is
in
terms
of
assuring
what
kind
of
voter
you
get
just
as
good
as
a
sixth
grade
english
speaking
education,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
more
--
most
recently,
if
i
may
ask
you
this
last
question,
in
a
week
or
two,
we
decided
the
guest
case
in
which
the
court
said
something
of
the
scope
of
section
5
power
as
giving
the
congress
power
to
do
things
that
perhaps
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
its
own
terms,
of
its
own
force,
was
not
reached.
do
you
find
any
assistance
for
your
argument
in
what
we
didn't
get
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
a
matter
of
american
money
support,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example
your
school
system
is
supported
locally,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
general
grant
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
you
double
quote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mrs.
coon,
may
i
ask,
do
i
correctly
infer
from
what
you've
said
then
that
there
is
an
area
of
congressional
determination
of
what
constitutes
invidious
discrimination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
--
that's
to
say,
we
start
with
the
premise,
i
gather,
that
congress
makes
a
determination
of
a
given
requirement
to
adhere
the
english
literacy
requirement
constitutes
invidious
discrimination
against
those
who
have
only
spanish
speaking
education.
do
we
start
with
that
premise
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
just
what
i'm
trying
to
get
into.
i
don't
quite
follow
that
congress
has
this
power
to
determine
what
is
an
invidious
discrimination.
i
have
trouble
of
knowing
how
we
can
second
guess
that
determination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
suggest
the
presumption
against
the
--
against
the
determination
that
this
does
constitute
as
invidious
discrimination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
what
--
by
what
standard
do
we
--
do
we
review
that
congressional
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
we
ever
done
this
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it
has
done
some
things
like
this
in
other
area,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you're
suggesting
that
this
case
does
pose
problems
i'm
afraid
they
have
not
seen.
that
is
assuming
this
is
an
equal
protection
problem.
assuming
that
congress
has
made
the
determination
of
invidious
discrimination,
now
this
confronts
us
with
how
far
we
may
review
the
congressional
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
can
understand
this
if
you
had
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
creates
no
equal
protection
problem
at
all,
that's
one
thing.
but
once
you
start
with
a
premise
that
i
thought
was
a
premise
to
your
argument
that
it
may
be
and
the
congress
has
an
authority
to
determine
what
is
an
invidious
discrimination.
now,
once
you
get
to
that,
and
that
i
think
is
a
lot
more
difficult.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
you
what
i
have
been
talking
to
mrs.
coons
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
insofar
if
it
does
at
all
in
light
of
the
--
of
the
rather
skimpy
record,
congressional
record
we
have
behind
4
(e),
but
insofar
as
that
rests
on
a
congressional
determination
that
this
worked
invidious
discrimination
against
puerto
ricans
from
new
york,
how
far
are
we
concluded
by
that
congressional
conclusion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
is
it
your
point
that
once
that
determination
is
made
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
if
they
are
inducted.
they

is
that
it?
