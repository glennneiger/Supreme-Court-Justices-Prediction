mr.
alfred
avins
avins,
your
honor.
if
your
honors
please,
i
do
not
intend
to
argue
today
the
reasonableness
of
the
new
york
statute.
i
leave
this
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
and
to
the
first
assistant
and
the
learned
assistant
attorney
general
who
will
argue
after
me.
i
intend
to
spend
my
time
first
on
the
power
over
the
territories
briefly
and
then
to
go
into
what
i
feel
are
the
very
large
questions
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
very
basic
and
broad
questions
which
i
believe
that
this
statute
raises.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
were
shortly
be
frank,
i
will
go
into
the
power
over
the
territories
first
because
i
intend
to
talk
about
that
only
very
briefly
before
i
go
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
which
the
statute
is
purportedly
based.
now,
i
start
out
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
local
or
state
or
municipal
sovereignty,
i
prefer
to
call
it
municipal
sovereignty
and
national
sovereignty.
the
united
states
have
had
territories
since
1789
or
before
that,
the
northwest
territories
which
have
been
considered
to
be
in
wardship
of
the
federal
government.
under
the
power
of
the
territorial
clause,
it
is
my
contention
that
congress
exercises
only
what
we
call
municipal
sovereignty,
a
sovereignty
which
is
substituted
for
state
sovereignty.
in
fact
the
identical
sovereignty,
which
the
states
exercised
as
distinguished
from
national
sovereignty
under
other
powers
of
the
federal
government
which
congress
has
exercised
to
both
the
territories
and
the
states.
and
that
any
power
under
national
sovereignty
must
be
found
elsewhere
other
than
in
the
territories
clause.
now,
the
department
of
justice
has
argued
and
made
much
of
that
i
believe
that
in
other
instances,
congress
has
exercised
extraterritorial
power
of
the
territories.
i
concede
that
point
but
so
have
the
states.
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
state
law
sometimes
has
extraterritorial
effect.
hughes
against
fetter
is
a
recent
and
fairly
good
example
of
this,
i
would
think.
and
my
contention
is
that
congress
has
power
over
the
territory
in
giving
extraterritorial
effect
in
the
identical
circumstances
that
a
state
law
would
have
extraterritorial
effect.
and
at
the
same
type
of
a
state
law
would
be
upheld
as
it
would
be
upheld
under
the
territorial
clause
--
territorial
clause
in
respect
to
its
act
of
territorial
effect.
if
this
were
otherwise,
it
would
follow
that
when
a
territory
which
was
always
considered
to
be
in
temporary
wardship
became
a
state,
it
would
follow
that
a
citizen
of
the
state
would
lose
rights
that
he
had
previously
enjoyed
under
a
statute
under
the
congress'
power
to
govern
the
territories.
be
specific.
let
us
assume
that
puerto
rico
became
a
state.
thereafter,
congress
could
not
pass
the
statute
because
it's
under
the
territories
clause,
because
in
respect
to
that,
it
would
have
no
more
power.
accordingly,
citizens
of
puerto
rico
who
moved
to
new
york
would
lose
rights.
and
i
think
it
anomalous
to
think
that
under
a
territories
clause,
persons
who
move
from
one
state
--
persons
who
are
citizens
of
a
territory
gain
statehood
status
go
down
in
their
rights
rather
than
up.
i
think
it
were
always
deemed
the
citizens
of
territories
certainly
had
no
greater
rights
than
citizens
of
states,
whatever
left
the
rights,
whatever
the
question
of
whether
they
have
left
the
rights
or
not
which
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
into.
they
certainly
had
no
greater
rights.
now,
i
look
at
the
question
this
way.
what
would
happen
if
the
state
of
louisiana
passed
the
law
saying
that
all
citizens
of
louisiana
educated
in
the
french
language
who
moved
to
the
state
of
new
york
or
to
some
other
state
which
had
an
english
language
literacy
test,
would
be
entitled
to
vote
provided
they
have
the
same
level
of
education.
now,
i
think
it's
crystal
clear
that
if
one
state
passed
such
a
law,
it
would
not
be
enforceable
in
another
state
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
because
i
do
not
think
that
a
state
can
give
its
own
law
extraterritorial
effect.
therefore,
i
conclude,
that
if
that
is
so,
the
identical
point
follows
in
respect
to
a
law
of
congress
under
the
territories
clause.
accordingly,
the
point
i
therefore
make
is,
that
congress
could
not
as
he
said
it
and
didn't
say
it
was
but
could
not,
have
passed
the
statute
under
the
territories
clause.
and
for
this
reason,
even
if
it
were
permissible
to
consider
this
statute
merely
under
the
territories
clause,
a
point
which
i
do
not,
even
if
it
was
permissible
to
do
so,
the
statute
would
not
be
valid
under
the
territories
clause.
for
the
reason,
that
is
an
excess
of
congress'
power
to
pass
because
it
is
not
an
exercise
of
municipal
legislation.
it
is
not
an
exercise
of
legislation
similar
to
a
statute
for
example
which
says
that
a
gas
in
a
--
an
automobile
who
had
an
accident
in
puerto
rico
who
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence
could
not
recover
against
the
host.
new
york
of
course,
would
probably
require
to
enforce
that
under
full
faith
and
credit.
and
that
i
can
see
that
the
supremacy
clause
simply
carries
over
the
notion
of
a
full
faith
and
credit
clause
in
respect
to
this
matter
to
which
it
is
the
identical
type
of
clause
in
respect
to
this
matter.
mr.
alfred
avins
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
this
time
your
honor,
i
intend
to
devote
the
remaining
period
of
my
time
to
the
general
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
its
application
in
this
case,
and
what
i
respectfully
conceived
to
be
this
court's
duty
and
congress'
duty
in
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
taken
broadly
and
without
regard
to
the
question
of
reasonableness.
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
your
honor.
in
my
estimation,
the
reason
i'm
not
discussing
that
is
because
i
conceive
that
the
treaty
clause
gives
congress
no
independent
power.
and
that
if
the
treaty
is
outside
of
the
general
scope
of
congress'
power
elsewhere,
congress
cannot
increase
its
power
by
making
a
treaty
with
the
foreign
country.
i
believe
that
your
honors
observe
this
fact
in
reid
against
covert
and
therefore,
i
do
not
believe
in
accordance
with
long
settled
precedent
and
i
think
in
accordance
with
the
general
nature
of
the
government
that
the
treaty
power
is
not
a
grant
of
substantive
power
above
and
beyond
that
which
congress
is
allowed
in
those
foreign
affairs
which
would
have
by
statute.
therefore,
i
will
not
argue
--
and
in
addition,
as
i
believe
i've
mentioned
before,
i
will
not
argue
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
the
new
york
statute
leaving
it
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
york.
i
might
note
preliminarily
that
the
department
of
justices'
briefs
has
a
great
many
statistics
on
puerto
rico.
i
believe
that
the
habit
of
using
statistics
in
briefs
started
with
muller
against
oregon
by
the
late
mr.
justice
brandeis
that
of
an
attorney.
and
i
think
has
increased
to
the
point
in
which
appendices
and
now
all
statistics
and
no
constitution.
as
your
honors
know,
i
have
made
a
distinct
departure
from
that.
my
appendix
contains
all
constitution
in
those
statistics.
and
i
leave
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
and
to
the
department
of
justice
the
question
of,
how
many
immigrants
there
was
average
annual
rainfall
in
puerto
rico
and
also
with
some
other
statistics
which
in
my
estimation
are
wholly
irrelevant.
the
general
question,
as
i
conceive
it,
is
what
was
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
questions
of
this
character?
before
i
go
into
that,
i
intend
to
got
start
out
which
i
consider
to
be
a
useful
starting
point
with
the
dred
scott
case
which
was
cited
by
judge
mcgowan
below
but
in
a
somewhat
different
context
that
i
am
going
to
discuss.
i
might
say
that
i
consider
these
questions
fundamental
and
as
broad
as
the
hills
and
not
nearly
as
narrow
as
i
believe
my
learned
opponents
contend.
first
of
all,
what
were
the
questions
decided
in
the
dred
scott
case.
one,
the
missouri
compromises
unconstitutional
because
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
two,
that
negroes
were
not
citizens
under
article
4
section
2
of
the
old
interstate
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
both
of
these
decisions
were
contrary
to
what
i
call
egregious
historical
facts
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
of
the
present
time
it
is
believe
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
in
accordance
with
history.
now,
the
two
things
the
radical
republicans
cited
to
show
that
these
decisions
were
contrary
to
egregious
historical
facts
were
one,
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
the
fact
of
the
northwest
ordinance
which
it
could
not
be
presumed
congress
intended
to
repeal
by
the
fifth
amendment
is
almost
contemporaneous.
and
two,
in
respect
to
article
4
section
2,
the
fact
that
in
june
25th,
1778
south
carolina
delegation
moved
to
insert
the
word
‘white'
in
the
premises
of
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
this
was
defeated
by
a
vote
of
eight
to
two
with
one
state
divided.
now,
the
radicals
charged
and
repeatedly
throughout
the
congressional
of
debates
that
the
dred
scott
decision
was
not
in
fact
a
judicial
decision.
that
it
was
a
political
decision
designed
to
support
the
buchanan
version
of
a
great
society
and
slave
holding
ideology.
and
that
it
was
designed
to
one,
commit
the
extension
of
slavery
into
the
territories;
and
two,
most
important
in
respect
to
article
4
section
2,
which
is
necessary
to
an
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
was
designed
to
keep
free
negroes
who
were
believed
to
be
the
natural
leaders
of
slavery
out
of
sovereign
states.
and
i
think
the
horror
incident
which
your
honors
may
remember
in
1844
is
a
good
example
of
the
dread
which
the
sovereign
states
have
for
having
freed
negroes
declared
citizens
under
article
4
section
2.
now,
what
was
the
radical
reaction
to
this?it
was,
in
blunt
terms
that
the
tory
court,
were
making
political
speeches
to
support
the
buchanan
and
pierce
administration.
now,
when
the
radical
swept
into
power,
the
political
tide
turned,
of
course.
and
the
political
supports
of
this
court
as
an
institution
were
withdrawn
and
decisions
how
to
stand
on
the
question
of
whether
they
were
on
the
bedrock
of
the
constitution.
and
i
think
history
supports
my
position
that
what
the
tory
--
or
the
position
of
the
radical
but
what
the
tory
court
did
was
to
mortgage
the
political
future
of
the
court
with
the
then
current
ideology,
which
when
swept
away,
swept
away
the
only
assets
that
this
court
had
to
with
the
prestige
among
lawyers
of
all
political
factions
based
on
decisions,
based
on
the
law.
and
once
those
mortgages
were
foreclosed,
the
court
was
left
without
assets.
of
the
political
nature,
of
course,
congress
retained
its
power
over
the
person,
the
executive
over
the
sword
that
this
court
has
nothing
but
power
over
the
law.
and
i
think
the
radicals
in
their
speech
has
pointed
out,
that
as
long
as
this
court
--
that
as
long
as
the
political
branches
of
the
government
support
this
court's
position
that
the
question
of
whether
it
makes
decisions
based
on
the
law,
current
ideology
is
irrelevant,
but
that
it
needs
us
--
withdrawn
by
a
change
in
ideological
occurrence,
the
result
is
that
decisions
are
swept
away.
and
the
court
--
the
decisions
are
then
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
whether
they
are
based
on
the
law.
and
the
fact
that
the
tory
court
did
in
fact
shore
--
shear
itself
with
the
power
to
do
anything
is
i
think
exemplified
an
ex
parte
merryman
where
the
lincoln
administration
tore
up
mr.
justice
taney's
writs
and
used
as
it
a
confetti
and
in
ex
parte
mccardle
where
the
radical
congress
simply
barred
this
court
from
many
review.
a
very
legitimate
one
is
protecting
the
south
against
the
excess
of
reconstruction.
now,
i
want
to
say
to
your
honors
very
respectfully
that
i
see
analogies
to
that
case
today.
and
i
want
to
say
that
in
this
case,
there
are
egregious
historical
facts
which
support
the
position
that
i
take
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
covers
only
what
were
known
in
1866
as
civil
rights
and
not
political
rights
at
all.
these
facts
are
contained
in
approximately
100
pages
of
legislative
history
appendix
which
i
have
filed
with
your
honors.
and
i
will
say
that
i
think
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
department
of
justice
to
burn
the
congressional
gloss
if
they
would
convince
anybody
that
the
original
understanding
was
in
accordance
with
this
statute.
now,
i
believe
what
is
ultimately
at
stake
is
the
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
which
is
your
honor
may
know
rests
on
the
historical
compromises
of
1876
and
'94
in
which
the
south
generally
agreed
not
to
contest
ratification
in
return
for
a
construction
which
was
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
original
understanding
which
is
very
narrow.
i
think
erie
railroad
company
against
tompkins
and
the
opinion
of
the
late
mr.
justice
brandeis
is
a
prototype
of
what
happens,
because
in
that
case,
the
flowering
of
swift
against
tyson,
as
i
see
it
in
response
to
the
needs
of
big
business
after
the
civil
war,
and
i
think
i
may
say
the
excesses
under
that
decision
was
such
as
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
an
examination
of
the
original
understanding,
and
of
course,
the
tail
going
with
the
head
the
fifteenth
amendment
ratification
rests
with
the
fourteenth.
now,
i
feel
entirely
justified
in
saying
that
this
statute
cuts
a
deep
gash
in
the
original
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
it
is
back
from
where
i
want
to
go
to
and
that
to
which
i
want
to
spend
my
time,
of
course.
and
i
would
like
to
make
my
position
as
clear
as
i
can
in
respect
to
this
question
of
original
understanding.
i
do
not
view
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
an
accordion
which
expands
or
contracts
in
respect
of
who's
playing
the
tune.
i
view
it
in
respect
as
a
fixed
document.
and
my
position
is
that
the
beginning,
middle,
and
end
of
all
constitutional
inquiry
is
the
original
understanding
of
the
framers
and
of
the
legislative
debates
are
clear.
they
are
conclusive.
cases
in
the
court
are
superfluous
and
those
contraries
are
erroneous.
and
for
this
reason,
i
intend
to
go
to
the
original
understanding
and
to
that
alone.
now,
i
would
start
out
by
saying
that
trying
to
vote
the
statute
on
the
equal
protection
clause
is
like
trying
to
carry
the
washington
monument
in
the
wheelbarrow.
your
honors
cannot
make
it
fit
because
the
equal
protection
clause
is
much
too
narrow.
it
would
--
in
my
estimation,
it
would
require
a
plastic
surgery
on
the
equal
protection
clause
to
sustain
the
statute
then
i
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well
i'm
not
--
i
think
your
honor
that
they
are
equal
to
the
washington
monument.
how
much,
i'm
not
entirely
certain.
mr.
alfred
avins
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
quite
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
avins
well
i
--
i
take
the
position
of
the
original
standing
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
what
were
known
in
1866
as
political
rights.
mr.
alfred
avins
under
the
original
understanding,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
avins
nor
those,
there
are
others.
mr.
alfred
avins
pardon,
sir?
mr.
alfred
avins
well
as
far
as
that
case
is
concerned
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
an
amount
of
more
than
one
power
that
was
also
i
believe
that
power
under
the
--
the
power
to
control
article
1,
i
believe,
section
2,
federal
power
over
the
times,
places
and
manners
of
holding
election.
and
therefore,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
not
an
entirely
different
inquiry.
but
i'm
now
going
to
the
basic
question
of
what
--
mr.
alfred
avins
yes
your
honor,
let
me
--
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
raise
one
point
which
i
don't
--
which
the
department
of
justice
raised
in
its
brief
but
in
a
different
way.
the
department
of
justice
cited
in
support
of
those
cases
the
enforcement
act
of
1870.
now,
i
did
not
notice
this
any
place
but
i
want
to
make
one
point
about
that.
as
reported
out
and
passed
in
the
houses,
it
was
reported
out
from
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
shared
by
congressman
john
a.
bingham
of
ohio
who
drafted
the
first
section
of
fourteenth
amendment
often
the
declaration
of
citizenship.
it
would
made
--
it
was
made
a
criminal
offense
for
state
officials
to
fail
to
collect
poll
taxes
from
negroes.
the
only
other
offense
is
i
think
was
section
2
was
the
failure
of
--
i'm
sorry,
the
failure
to
register;
failure
to
register
or
to
collect
poll
taxes.
it
was
broadened
in
by
senator
stewart
in
the
senate
from
the
judiciary
committee
on
the
grounds
of
sovereign
state
by
bringing
up
other
prerequisites.
but
originally
the
very
act
possibly
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments,
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
the
state
--
for
the
state
officials,
election
officials
to
fail
to
collect
poll
taxes
from
the
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well
your
honor,
i
--
i
want
to
get
into
that
in
terms
of
the
original
meaning
of
equal
protection.
and
then
--
and
i
do
fully
intend
to
get
into
this
question.
mr.
alfred
avins
there
are
--
the
due
process
clause
i
don't
think
anybody
considers
to
be
relevant.
i've
seen
nothing
that
anybody
can
see
the
irrelevance
so
i
deal
with
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
which
granted
privilege
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
citizens
only
and
equal
protection
which
is
granted
to
all
persons,
a
distinction
which
i
think
is
very
significant.
now,
i
start
out
by
detailing
what
i
believe
the
original
understanding
of
the
word
‘protection'.
now
this
is
the
keyword.
not
equal,
it
doesn't
mean
equal
rights,
equal
benefits,
equal
privileges,
it
means
equal
protection.
it
doesn't
mean
the
equal
protect
--
it
doesn't
mean
the
protection
of
equal
law
that
means
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
just
a
pair
of
alligator
is
different
from
an
alligator
pair.
the
word
‘protection'
comes
from
the
original
draft
of
bingham
speech
and
bingham's
draft,
giving
congress
the
power
to
enforce
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
derived
from
article
4
section
2
and
equal
protection
of
life,
liberty
and
property.
and
bingham
speeches,
i
think
read
carefully
show
that
it
meant
protection
of
the
right
to
life
which
is
every
person
even
an
alien
baby
is
entitled
so
you
couldn't
take
the
life
of
a
baby.
protection
of
liberty
which
i
think
every
person
is
entitled
to
and
protection
of
property.
and
bingham
speeches
show
it
meant
property
acquired
lawfully
and
obtained
lawfully
personal
property,
as
in
the
cases
like
roth
against
slaughter
which
he
has
cited
in
his
original
speeches.
so
your
honors
originally,
protection,
the
equal
protection
clause
was
designed
not
only
for
aliens,
for
travelers,
for
resident
aliens,
for
everybody.
that's
why
the
word
‘person'
is
there.
and
of
course
i
might
say
this
that
under
the
original
concept
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
no
reasonable
classification
is
necessary
because
every
--
i
think
one
can
conceive
that
every
person
is
entitled
to
the
same
protection
of
life,
liberty,
and
property
which
every
other
person
is
entitled
to.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
case
as
far
as
its
original
understanding
is
concerned.
that
is
to
say
it
is
confined
exactly,
it
was
merely
a
redraft,
your
honors
may
recall
that
the
bingham
draft
was
postponed
in
the
house.
it
was
postponed
because
the
majo
--
many
of
the
republicans,
hutchinson
and
hale
and
other
republican
congresses
felt
it
gave
congress
too
much
power.
so
it
was
postponed
and
redrafted
to
be
a
negative
limitation
on
the
state
similar
to
the
limitation
which
the
old
sec
--
limitations
of
article
1
section
10
were.
therefore,
in
my
estimation
the
equal
protection
clause
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
at
all
with
this
case
of
any
kind.
i
take
that
broad
ground.
i
realized
the
broader
ground
than
perhaps
it's
been
put
forth
in
recent
years.
but
i
think
it's
the
correct
ground
when
one
goes
back
to
be
with
you
on
the
stand.
now,
let
me
give
some
illustrations.
in
1870,
the
enforcement
act
was
passed,
just
passed
largely
to
protect
chinese
in
california
who
were
not
permitted
to
be
witnesses
in
cases.
and
the
right
to
be
a
witness
was
a
protection
because
of
course,
if
a
person
could
not
be
a
witness,
it
means
--
and
some
of
these
speeches
show
that
he
could
be
robbed
with
impunity.
and
therefore,
it
was
necessary
to
protect
him
in
this
right.
this
is
part,
i
think,
of
the
word
‘protection'.
i
therefore
deem
that
reasonable
classification
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
equal
protection
clause
at
all.
now,
i
turn
to
what
i
considered
to
be
the
more
important
clause,
to
which
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
where
did
it
come
from?
what
was
it
meant
to
do?
now,
the
reason
for
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
was
the
defect
in
the
--
according
to
bingham
with
the
defect
in
the
original
constitution
that
congress
had
no
power
to
enforce
article
4
section
2,
that
the
necessary
improper
clause
that
not
give
it
any
power
to
enforce
article
4
section
2.
its
derogation
comes
from
two
different
sources,
although
originally
drafted
to
give
congress
that
is
the
concepts,
i'm
sorry,
i
shouldn't
give
the
derogation.
derogation
comes
straight
from
article
4
section
2.
and
bingham
speeches
indicate
very
clearly
that
he
believed
there
was
an
ellipsis
in
article
4
section
2,
unlike
the
democrats
who
felt
was
just
designed
to
prevent
a
discrimination
against
out
of
state
residents.
he
believe
that
the
word
of
citi
--
of
the
united
states
should
be
inserted
off
to
the
words
‘privileges',
that
is
so
what
should
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens.
and
after
that
of
the
united
states
in
the
several
states
in
of
the
united
states
being
the
ellipsis.
the
question
therefore
boils
down
to
what
was
bingham's
concept
of
privileges,
where
did
they
get
it
from.
what
did
they
believe
it
contain
because
even
if
it
contained
something
different
by
the
old
framers,
the
questions
what
went
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
also
one
of
radicals
believe
it
contends.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
radicals
believe
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
which
is
of
course
broader
than
the
equal
protection
clause
since
they
were
only
right
for
citizens,
well
how
to
be
a
citizen
derive
any
protection
from
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
protecting
what
were
known
an
1866
as
civil
rights,
that
is
to
say
not
political
rights
but
rather
civil
rights
as
we
know
in
1866.
now,
i
think
i
am
supported
by
many
--
by
a
multitude
in
this
number
of
citations
which
i
have
in
my
appendices
and
which
i
shall
not
unless
your
honors
are
particularly
interested
to
meet
legislative
appendices
which
i
have
filed
with
this
court.
but
i
want
to
call
your
honors'
attention
for
example
to
a
footnote
which
i
added,
to
the
report
of
the
joint
committee
on
reconstruction
of
1866,
which
i
think
shows
very
clearly
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
reported
out
to
protect
only
civil
rights.
civil
rights
at
that
time
were
believed
to
be
what
are
known
as
today
as
natural
rights,
or
that
is
to
what
--
i'm
sorry
what
were
known
then
as
natural
rights
today's
concept
of
natural
rights
might
be
a
good
deal
of
difference.
but
they
were
intended
to
protect
what
were
known
at
that
time
as
natural
rights.
and
they
were
derived
from
two
sources
one,
the
decision
of
this
that
justice
washington
on
the
circuit
in
1823
in
corfield
against
coryell,
which
i
assume
is
your
honors
are
all
familiar
with
then
i
shall
go
through,
and
two,
protections
existing
already
in
the
constitution
itself,
that
is
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
were
deemed
to
be
those
protections
which
existed
in
the
constitution,
protection
against
bills
of
attainder,
and
so
forth,
and
many
protections.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
this
discussion
between
if
there's
a
(inaudible)
and
there's
a
famine
about
whether
all
the
bills
of
rights
or
just
part
where
--
but
i
think
at
least
some
of
it
whether
it's
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
i
don't
think
any
of
them
went
to
due
process
clause.
but
i
think
it
all
went
to
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
for
this
authority
i
cite
a
statement
by
senator
pomeroy
in
1870
that
aliens
have
no
right
to
petition
the
united
states
senate.
it
was
a
privilege
of
citizens
alone,
one
of
the
many
aspects
i
think
which
shed
light
as
far
as
the
original
understanding
of
the
framers
are
concerned.
now,
at
that
what
were
considered
to
be
civil
rights
the
right
to
work,
the
right
to
travel,
the
right
to
raise
a
family,
the
right
to
do
business,
to
buy
and
sell
and
own
property,
that
is
what
were
considered
an
--
and
have
security
therefore,
the
right
to
bring
a
suit,
lawsuit,
or
the
things
that
were
considered
in
1866
to
be
civil
rights.
among
the
things
excluded
for
what
we
known
as
conventional
rights.
and
i
might
say
again
i'm
supported
in
this
if
your
honors
may
know
of
the
colloquy
that
senator
lyman
trumbull,
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
1872,
hired
with
senator
george
edmund,
member
of
the
judiciary
committee
in
which
he
said
that
this
was
confined
to
civil
rights
and
does
not
include
the
right
to
go
to
school,
does
not
include
the
right
to
vote,
does
not
include
any
conventional
rights,
it
just
included
what
were
known
as
basic
or
natural
rights.
now,
i
suppose
the
question
must
be
asked,
why
not
--
why
then
put
this
back
into
article
4
section
--
if
it's
article
4
section
2,
why
put
it
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
short
answer
was
that
as
part
of
the
guarantees,
post
civil
war
guarantees,
cong
--
the
radical
congress
demanded
that
the
south
give
it
the
power
to
enforce
in
full
these
rights.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
fifth
section
which
i
believe
has
been
argued
at
some
length
in
this
case.
my
position
as
to
the
fifth
section
is
i
think
quite
simple.
the
power
to
enforce
does
not
include
the
power
to
amend.
the
power
to
enforce
does
not
include
the
power
to
define.
the
power
to
enforce
is
simply
the
power
to
enforce
what
is
in
the
other
section.
in
fact,
there
were
some
arguments
by
the
democrats,
the
power
to
enforce
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
first
section
at
all
because
it
was
the
third
section,
a
really
controversial
section,
which
congress
demanded
the
power
to
enforce
as
spevack
confederates
out
of
public
office.
now,
my
contention
is
that
since
in
1866
and
1868,
states
were
free
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
make
up
such
qualifications
for
voting
the
date
it
shows,
that
they
have
the
identical
freedom
today.
that
is
to
say
that
constitution
--
principles
of
the
constitution
remains
fixed
until
amended
in
the
manner,
the
precise
manner
which
is
set
out
in
article
5.
this
is
what
i
think
is
the
basic
issue
in
respect
to
this
statute
and
in
respect
to
this
case.
that
is
to
say
that
the
historical
intent
remains
fixed.
i
think
i
can
draw
an
analogy
in
this
way
with
a
favorite
little
story
by
radical
republicans
in
1850,
the
1850s
about
a
vermont
judge.
they
were
fond
of
citing
his
decision.
he
was
asked
to
return
a
slave
under
the
fugitive
slave
law.
he
demanded
proof
of
ownership
which
is
entitled
to
under
a
fugitive
slave
law.
he
was
given
a
bail
of
sale
by
the
owner
but
made
out
by
the
prior
owner.
he
said
to
the
judge
that
he
would
only
recognize
the
bill
of
sale
from
his
maker.
and
so
i
say,
it
was
the
same
thing
in
respect
to
the
constitution
that
the
powers
must
be
found
under
the
grounds
of
the
makers.
that
is
the
only
place,
not
of
present
congressional
statute.
now,
in
my
estimation
the
statute
is
such
noble
theory
that
it
should
be
patented
in
the
patent
office
except
that
i
do
not
know
that
it
would
meet
this
court's
test
of
utility.
but
i
certainly
think
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
congress
has
ever
tried
to
amend
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
the
guise
of
enforcing
especially
in
respect
of
political
rights.
i
might
say
this.
i
believe
in
the
legislative
history
appendix
which
i've
submitted,
which
i
wrote
the
state
of
virginia,
my
also
--
my
article
in
stanford
law
review,
and
in
the
appendix
which
i
submitted
here.
i
pointed
out
very
clearly
that
during
the
debates
on
the
fifteenth
amendment,
repeating
attempts
were
made
to
ban
states
using
qualifications
based
on
literacy,
property,
religion.
i
might
say
in
respect
to
religion
there
was
a
very
raw
example
because
roman
catholic
was
forbidden
to
hold
office
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
very
raw
example.
one
is
quite
often
cited
with
respect
to
an
english
language
literacy
test,
we
don't
have
to
look
very
far.
the
state
of
massachusetts
as
well
as
connecticut
had
an
english
language
literacy
test
and
its
purpose
was
not
as
benign
as
the
new
york
statute
is
here.
its
purpose
was
to
keep
out
irish
democratic
immigrants
away
from
the
polling
booth.
it
was
a
no
nothing
product.
it
was
kindly
talk
about
during
the
reconstruction
period
and
yet
it
was
maintained
during
this
entire
period.
rhode
island
had
a
better
trick.
they
require
that
all
naturalized
citizens
own
land
in
rhode
islands.
and
as
one
demo
--
senator
bland
said
of
missouri,
there
wasn't
very
much
man
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
for
anybody
to
own.
the
rhode
island
--
senator
anthony
of
rhode
island
said
that
he
wouldn't
let
the
fourth
--
he
wouldn't
vote
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
rhode
island
legislature
wouldn't
ratify
unless
congress
took
out
the
property
qualifications.
that
is
a
ban
on
property
qualifications.
so
they
did.
and
in
respect
to
--
in
respect
to
other,
the
nativity
qualification
of
the
west
coast
republicans
were
dead
set
against
letting
any
chinese
vote.
that's
why
the
nativity
was
taken
out.
according
to
senator
aaron
sargent,
a
california
republican,
i'm
now
citing
the
majority
republicans,
i'm
not
citing
the
democrats
for
these
propositions.
and
so
the
original
draft,
the
wilson
draft
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
waddled
away.
now,
there
was
a
proposed
draft
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
give
everybody
an
equal
vote.
it
was
the
original
bingham
draft.
and
it
was
defeated
very
resoundingly.
now,
if
bingham
had
put
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
everybody
is
entitled
to
an
equal
vote
or
an
equal
vote
without
--
based
on
a
reasonable
classification
why
should
he
make
the
same
amendment
in
the
fifteenth
two
years
later
superfluous.
i
think
it
defies
common
sense
to
say
that
the
original
--
original
framers
who
would
make
all
of
this
enactment
absolutely
which
would
absolutely
be
nonsense
in
comparison
with
what
they
actually
did
thereafter.
that
is
to
say
the
original
debates
of
1866
are
reinforced
by
everything
that
the
framers
did
from
one
end
to
the
other.
and
it
is
on
this
that
i
rest
as
to
the
original
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
department
of
justice
has
submitted
four
little
items
on
which
you
understand.
i
believe
one
of
them
is
a
little
tidbit
from
senator
howard
which
is
i
think
so
broad
and
vague
as
virtually
meaningless.
i
have
a
material
from
senator
howard
which
i
shouldn't
read
to
your
honors
because
it's
in
the
appendices
that
i've
filed
which
shows
very
clearly
repeatedly
he
said
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
franchise.
in
--
they
also
have
a
couple
of
statements
by
democrats
and
some
of
the
states
saying
what
a
horrible
thing
this
is
going
to
be.
i
think
they're
clearly
political
speeches
and
i
think
we
can
ignore
them.
it
is
not
--
the
justice
department's
brief
does
not
cite
but
i
think
i
want
to
go
into
for
a
moment
because
it's
probably
familiar
to
you
your
honor
an
article
by
mr.
ben
allstar
in
the
law
review
journal
--
i'm
sorry,
the
supreme
court
reviewed
last
year.
unfortunately,
mr.
ben
allstar
has
had
unhappy
habit
of
putting
a
material
that
he
finds
favorable.
i've
put
in
a
material
in
these
appendices
which
are
both
favorable
and
a
little
bit
which
i
deemed
to
be
unfavorable
to
with
boswell
speech,
that
is
congressman
boswell,
right
before
the
enactment
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
there
were
--
i'm
sorry
and
senator
edmund.
i
want
to
take
up
these
two
people
because
they're
the
only
people
who
are
unfavorable
to
my
position.
i
think
really
except
for
the
democrats.
as
for
boswell,
i
think
i
can
explain
this
very
easily
though
he
--
this
admitted
to
by
--
he
never
practiced
law
until
long
after
he
left
the
senate
and
house.
so
he
really
wasn't
a
lawyer.
as
to
edmunds,
though
he
said
originally
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
not
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
privileges
and
immunities
clause
did
grant
congress
some
power
over
the
right
to
vote
to
with
the
right
to
prevent
discrimination
against
negroes.
thereafter,
he
changed
his
position
in
1872
concurred
with
the
rest
in
saying
that
privileges
and
immunities
clause
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
to
vote.
and
therefore,
i
take
the
broad
grounds
that
there
is
really
no
substantial
material
in
the
debates,
it's
not
a
question
of
weighing
them.
there
is
no
substantial
material
in
the
debates
which
is
contrary
to
the
position
that
the
original
understanding
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
anything
other
than
what
was
known
as
a
civil
right
in
1866
and
1868.
and
therefore,
i
prompt
my
feet
firmly
on
the
original
understanding
--
on
the
original
understanding
of
these
amendments.
now,
i
might
say
that
several
of
the
gentlemen
who
have
preceded
me
have
indicated
that
they
belie
--
mr.
alfred
avins
which
words,
the
protection
of
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
alfred
avins
equal
protection
of
the
laws.because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
was
originally
intended
was
clearly
protection.
that
is
to
say
if
one
goes
back
to
the
mischief,
it
is
not
difficult
to
realize
why
the
word
protection
was
used.
let
me
give
your
honor
an
example.
a
single
example
i
think
will
suffice
both
of
the
use
of
the
word
person
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
use
of
the
word
protection.
in
1850,
the
supreme
court
of
california
decided
that
under
the
law
of
california,
chinese
were
assimilated
to
indians
and
were
not
permitted
to
testify
in
court.
in
1860,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
field
later
in
this
court
who
held
that
under
the
law,
if
a
white
man
beat
up
a
china
man
and
robbed
him
in
california
and
the
only
witnesses
were
chinese,
the
white
man
had
to
go
free.
now,
senator
conness
said
this
is
becoming
a
very
serious
problem
because
southern
born
confederates
became
highly
men
in
california.
he
used
another
term,
i
don't
remember,
and
then
he
said
they
were
just
plainly
highly
men.
and
what
they
would
do,
they
go
around
robbing
chinese
and
then
of
course
they
could
never
be
brought
to
book
because
the
only
witnesses
were
chinese
and
they
were
excluded
as
witnesses.
your
honors
you
may
remember,
that
under
the
old
slave
codes,
negroes
could
not
be
witnesses
where
whites
were
parties
whether
four
against
white.
this
is
one
of
the
objects
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
of
course
these
things
are
all
forgotten
because
these
laws
have
been
--
are
obsolete
--
i
mean
not
been
in
existence
for
100
years
and
so
of
course
the
original
mischief
have
been
forgotten.
but
at
that
time,
this
was
the
original
--
these
were
the
original
mischief
that
it
was
not
the
same
protection.
before
--
mr.
alfred
avins
i'm
afraid
to
say
that
it's
narrow
even
than
that.
that
is
to
say
that
privileges
and
immunities
clause
could
be
substituted
for
civil
rights
and
in
fact
the
civil
rights
act
though
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
of
debate
about
where
enforcing
the
thirteenth
amendment,
i
think
it's
very
clear
and
senator
lot
morrill
of
1872
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
civil
rights,
that
the
act
of
'66
really
rested
on
article
4
section
2.
the
big
quarrels
whether
congress
could
enforce
article
4
section
2.
that
is
to
say
if
negroes
were
freed,
were
they
therefore
ipso
facto
were
entitled
to
article
--
benefits
of
article
4
section
2.
this
--
that's
why
you
have
a
declaration
of
citizenship
in
the
--
first
sentence
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
now,
the
word
civil
rights
was
taken
out
of
the
act
which
your
honor
you
may
remember
because
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
on
the
subject
to
whether
voting
was
a
civil
right
and
senator
--
congressman
wilson,
the
later
senator
wilson,
congressman
wilson
of
ireland,
chairman
of
judiciary
committee
said
“no”
and
then
bingham
said
“yes”
and
what
it
said,
well
maybe
or
maybe
it's
too
broad
or
columbus
delano
of
ohio
said,
“this
is
pretty
broad,
who
knows
what's
going
to
be
interpreted
at.”
so
wilson
finally
said,
“alright,
we're
going
to
take
the
word
‘civil
rights'
right
out
in
just
list
the
‘right'.”
but
my
contention
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
you
could
replace
privileges
and
immunities
clause
with
the
word
‘civil
rights'
which
is
i
say
included
one,
the
right
in
corfield
against
coryell
and
two,
rights
derived
from
the
constitution
itself.
as
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
that's
narrow
still.
not
all
civil
rights
are
protected
by
the
equal
protection
clause
just
those
which
give
protection
to
life,
liberty,
or
property.
it's
a
very
narrow.
it's
a
very
little
clause.
i
might
say
that
the
whole
first
section
was
utterly
uncontroversial.
the
second
section
wasn't
very
controversial,
with
the
big
fight
on
the
third
section
on
whether
ex-confederates
should
be
disabled
from
holding
the
office
but
nobody
cared
about
the
first
section
being
to
surplusage,
it
was
just
a
little
unimportant
clause.
it's
just
very
basic.
mr.
alfred
avins
it
would
protect
persons.
first
of
all,
it
would
protect
aliens.
it
would
take
travels.
in
bingham,
as
an
early
as
bingham
speech
against
the
admission
of
oregon
in
the
35th
congress
second
session,
i
think
it
was
about
page
900
something
in
1859,
he
indicates
very
clear
that
even
strangers
are
entitled
to
some
protection.
and
he
repeated
this
recurring
theme
like
a
broken
record
over
and
over
through
the
debate.
even
strangers
get
something.
in
fact,
the
word
‘persons'
have
been
so
broadly
interpreted
that
i
might
say
this,
that
in
president
johnson's
veto
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
he
makes
a
point
that
he
conceived
the
word
‘persons'
to
include
corporations.
so
that
--
but
i
think
it
was
considered
on
all
sides
that
they've
included
aliens.
that's
the
reason
for
in
effect
duplicating
some
of
the
rights
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
the
equal
protection
and
the
due
process.
namely,
aliens
get
something
because
there
was
the
state,
it
was
believed
that
the
state
would
not
protect
aliens
either
even
of
these
basic
rights.
and
i
think
the
state
of
california
is
an
excellent
example.
the
history
of
the
state
of
california
is
an
excellent
example,
the
pre-antebellum
history
of
the
state
of
california
is
an
excellent
example,
and
perhaps
the
post-antebellum
to
some
extent
whatever
was
on
the
democratic
administration.
and
it
was
this
constant
discussion
about
democratic
legislature
discriminating
against
chinese
refusing
them
protection,
refusing
them
permission
to
testify
even
the
state
is
refusing
them
and
some
state
they
couldn't
be
parties,
they
couldn't
sue
the
law.
if
the
man
hits
you
on
the
nose,
it's
tough
luck,
you
couldn't
sue
in
court.
so
if
you
go
back
to
the
original
mischief,
there
is
a
very
good
reason
for
these
clauses.
and
my
contention
is
that
--
i
might
say
that
i
consider
as
a
contention
of
--
a
moment
where
it
comes
to
say
contention
of
the
legality,
that
is
to
say
that
it's
a
requirement
of
legality
that
a
constitution
be
interpreted
in
accordance
with
the
original
understanding
and
not
like
it.
they
once
said
in
the
alabama
lawyer
of
light
check
that
it
has
got
to
be
--
it
means
exactly
the
same
as
it
meant
in
1866,
of
course,
scientific
changes
simply
mean
that
you
substitute
one
scientific
methods
for
another
as
an
airplane
that
is
same
as
a
train
for
purposes
of
general
principles.
but
the
general
principles
remain
the
same
although
it
was
known
in
1866,
people
go
to
schools
were
known
--
these
are
--
all
these
things
were
known.
that
is
my
point.
and
now
i
might
say
that
i
--
some
of
the
gentlemen
on
the
other
side
have
said
that
voting
--
they
think
voting
is
very
fundamental.
i
don't
know
that
voting
is
as
fundamental
as
my
learned
opponent's
belief.
i
think
the
right
to
drive
a
car
for
example
is
more
fundamental
than
the
right
to
vote
because
in
those
places
of
the
country
you'd
never
even
get
to
the
polls
without
a
car.
and
i
might
say
that
i
think
if
we
took
a
survey
in
the
country
is
to
whether
people
would
rather
hitchhike
imposed
of
pay
$1.50
that
they'd
certainly
be
glad
to
pay
$1.50
rather
than
to
hitchhike
in
the
polls.
besides
which
i
might
say
that
i
think
new
york
city
would
tax
even
walking
through
the
polls
that
it
found
a
way
to
tax
walking
and
collecting.
i
think
that
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
right
to
vote
is
as
fundamental
for
example
as
the
privilege
of
not
being
barred
from
getting
in
trial,
which
was
certainly
involved
in
1866
because
you
had
negroes
who
were
forbidden
to
engage
in
certain
occupations
and
some
of
the
black
coast.
or
to
have
a
home,
same
thing
as
it
was
fit
in,
in
some
of
the
black
coast.
or
for
example
the
black
code
laws
which
made
the
criminal
offense
punished
by
--
i
thinking
in
virginia
five
years
in
penitentiary
teaching
negroes
to
read
and
write.
to
prevent
again
--
enforcement,
prevent
slavery
votes.
and
i
might
say
personally
that
for
example
i
voted
--
i
take
personally
that
all
of
the
candidates
i
voted
for
in
the
last
general
action
lost,
i
don't
feel
personally
affected
at
all
although
of
course,
i'm
over
26.
i
also
say
as
far
as
this
particular
statute
is
concerned
that
i
don't
see
the
slightest
degree
of
difference
in
principle
between
congress
saying
that
puerto
ricans
educating
spanish
in
puerto
rico
may
vote
in
new
york
and
the
puerto
ricans
who
are
taught
to
drive
in
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road,
puerto
rico
may
drive
in
new
york
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road.
i
think
they're
exactly
the
same.
true
there's
an
argument
about
inconvenience.
i
think
there's
an
argument
about
inconvenience
that
goes
both
ways.
it's
inconvenient
to
print
materials
in
spanish.
it's
also
inconvenient
to
dodge
opposing
traffic
that
i
would
say
of
the
person
who'd
lived
in
manhattan,
and
i
think,
and
in
new
york,
it
was
resourceful
enough
to
find
a
parking
space
in
manhattan
as
resourceful
enough
to
be
able
to
dodge
in
opposing
traffic.
mr.
alfred
avins
i
agree
with
your
honor,
they
don't.
they
do
it
in
the
united
kingdom.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
one,
congress
has
the
power
under
the
territories
to
teach
or
to
permit
puerto
ricans
to
learn
how
to
drive
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road.
and
two,
under
the
very
argument,
that
the
under
territories
argument
would
then
have
the
power
to
let
the
--
say
that
puerto
ricans
come
in
to
new
york
may
drive
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road
because
what's
what
they've
learned
at
home.
so
i
think
it's
entirely
similar.
mr.
alfred
avins
well
i
don't
know
about
that
your
honor.
as
i
said
before,
i
--
having
driven
in
new
york
city,
i'm
not
sure
that
new
york
isn't
really
quite
resourceful
about
driving.
now,
i
might
say
that
in
my
estimation
if
this
court
has
the
power
to
set
standards
of
reasonableness,
it
means
that
in
fact
didn't
affect
this
court
with
this
setting
voting
qualifications,
likewise
if
congress
had
the
power
to
set
reasonableness,
it
just
shifts
the
power
from
one
to
the
other,
for
the
reason
that
in
my
view,
one
man
reasonableness
is
another
man's
(inaudible)
i
think
if
we
pull
every
person
in
this
room
as
to
what
would
be
reasonable
voting
qualifications
and
i
find
some
very
diverse
ideas
on
the
subject.
i
pass
it
and
left
up
to
me
alone.
i
might
be
able
to
limit
the
suffrage
to
--
only
to
people
are
two
doctrines
involved,
one
american
and
one
english,
and
then
i
could
unanimously
left
myself
press
it,
where
i
think
there
would
people
who
will
dissent
from
that
statute.
so
i
think
that
everybody
has
his
own
idea
of
what
is
reasonable.
though
i
think
in
conclusion
that
a
part
of
the
government's
structure
is
like
a
proper
automobile,
these
brakes
as
well
as
gas
pedal
and
i
think
that
the
original
function
of
this
court
was
to
break
the
popular
branches
of
the
government
and
not
to
serve
as
an
impetus
to
forward
movement.
and
i
think
though
it
maybe
a
lot
of
fun
to
drive
a
car
with
three
gas
pedals
and
no
break.
i
think
sooner
or
later,
we
go
off
to
the
constitutional
road
and
have
a
crack
out.
and
what
i'm
seriously
concerned
about,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
is
that
unless
original
understanding
is
followed,
original
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
and
i
don't
think
that
my
contention
about
the
original
understanding
has
been
refuted
in
the
least
by
either
of
the
three
of
my
learned
opponents.
that
the
result
would
be
ultimately,
the
result
would
be
ultimately
that
we'd
be
going
off
the
constitutional
road.
cannot
say
that
we
need
to
give
the
original
understanding
at
present
time
a
high
requiem
mask
but
i
think
perhaps
extreme
motion,
made
shortly
to
be
an
order
if
this
case
this
court
hold
that
congress
have
the
power
to
ignore
it,
the
very
clear
understanding
that
occurred
in
this
case.
and
if
your
honors
have
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
any
rebuttal
which
may
appear
to
be
necessary.
mr.
alfred
avins
oh
i
see
your
honor.
well,
in
that
case,
all
i
can
say
is
that
well
i
think
--
i
think
perhaps
that
i,
if
i
have
made
myself
clear
as
to
this
particular
point,
i
might
go
on
to
the
question,
one
question
which
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
casts
of
it
which
i
just
left
in
my
brief
but
perhaps
i'll
make
a
point
or
two
about
that.
and
that
is
the
discrimination
which
involved
in
this
statute
between
american
citizens
who
are
born
in
new
york
and
educated
in
a
foreign
language
outside
of
new
york
and
american
citizens
who
are
born
in/or
at
point
american
citizens
born
in
puerto
rico
or
educated
in
spanish
in
puerto
rico.
now,
to
me
it
seems
that
the
federal
statute
itself
is
irrational.
that
is
to
say
if
we
are
getting
into
a
rational
distinction
but
i'm
not
getting
into
a
discretion
where
the
new
york
distinction
is
rational
but
i
think
the
federal
distinction
is
irrational.
that
is
to
say
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
this.
it
is
entirely
possible
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
makes
all
persons
born
to
be
united
states
citizens,
the
moment
of
birth
for
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
abate
to
be
taken
to
a
non-american
flag
school
educated
with
foreign
language.
it's
not
only
you
can
see
but
i'm
sure
it
happens
in
a
number
of
cases
and
in
fact
i
may
say
that
i
have
a
second
cousin
whose
child
is
in
fact
being
educated
in
chile,
the
only
american
citizen
born
in
the
united
states.
so
therefore,
it
only
can
happen
but
has
happened
at
least
in
one
instance.
now
supposing
that
person
comes
back,
educating
chile,
able
to
read
and
write
spanish
just
as
well
as
any
puerto
rican
in
the
united
states
is
concerned.
comes
back
to
new
york,
offers
to
vote,
can
read
the
spanish
newspapers
just
as
well
as
any
new
york
any
person
educated
in
puerto
rico
can
read
the
spanish
language
in
his
papers.
what
happens,
sorry,
time
has
made
a
distinction.
is
this
a
distinction
that
has
any
rational
basis
to
it
at
all?
they're
both
american
citizens.
they're
both
now
citizens
of
new
york
because
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
all
persons
or
all
--
all
american
citizens
are
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
reside.
therefore
my
point
is,
that
being
citizens
of
the
state
which
they
reside
they
are
now
new
yorkers
and
there
is
absolutely
no
rational
distinction
to
say
a
new
yorker
educated
in
puerto
rico
shall
be
entitled
to
vote
and
a
new
yorker
educated
in
chile
shall
not,
though
i
know
--
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
i
think
it's
an
argument
against
the
appellant
in
that
case
and
i
think
it's
an
argument
against
the
appellant's
here.
my
contention,
perhaps
i
haven't
made
myself
clear
about
that
your
honor.
my
contention
is
this.
that
if
you
are
going
to
let
persons
literate,
not
english
language
in
new
york
vote,
you
got
to
let
them
all
vote.
why
let
only
that
people
vote
who
are
educated
in
american
flag
schools?
mr.
alfred
avins
well
i
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well
yes,
that
--
except
that
the
federal
statute.
you
see
that
this
is
--
my
--
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
irrational
to
let
know
it.
again,
i
apparently
haven't
made
myself
clear.
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
irrational,
not
to
make
a
distinction
between
people
who
speak
english
and
speak
--
people
who
speak
spanish.
to
let
my
--
to
let
the
child
of
my
cousin
vote
in
new
york,
to
not
let
the
child
who
can
vote
in
new
york
reading
only
know
in
spanish
would
be
perfectly
rational
providing
with
dividing
line
the
spanish-english.
mr.
alfred
avins
right.
right
and
the
reason
for
it
is
this.
now,
i
know
it
was
argued
for
long
that
a
person
educated
puerto
rico
learns
something
about
civics,
about
the
national
government
et
cetera.
but
certainly
learns
nothing
about
the
new
york
the
issues
in
the
new
york
city
municipal
election.
if
i
may
take
a
specific
case,
who
should
be
bar
--
president
to
the
bars?
this
is
not
a
question
that
that
--
does
this
one
learns
civics
in
puerto
rico,
what
the
local
issues
with
the
source
are
in
the
bars.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
but
you
see
of
course
that
--
that
is
the
question
of
a
reasonableness
of
the
distinction
between
--
in
terms
of
english
language.
the
person
coming
from
the
state
of
washington
assuming
he's
literate
with
the
english
language
would
be
able
to
read
all
of
this
material
about
what's
going
on
in
the
(inaudible).
my
contention
is
--
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
although
of
course
--
of
course
a
person
moving
to
washington
may
stay
in
new
york
for
20
years
and
keep
himself
totally
uninformed
of
what's
going
on.
that
is
--
the
residents
doesn't
guarantee
that
the
person
will
know
what's
going
on.
he
may
be
--
he
may
just
be
as
ignorant
of
local
affairs
as
anybody
in
the
world.
mr.
alfred
avins
he
doesn't
--
mr.
alfred
avins
no
it's
not.
there
are,
i
think
six
of
well
they
keep
--
the
number
of
newspapers
keeps
condensing
every
couple
of
years
i'm
trying
to
keep
up
with
it.
soon
there
will
be
a
monopoly
so
i
--
mr.
alfred
avins
there
are
some
spanish
newspapers,
your
honor.
of
course
they
are
not
in
kingston,
they
are
up
state
new
york
city.
what
about
the
spanish
language
voter
who
is
tries
to
vote
in
the
--
and
the
third
ward
nasni.
they're
no
--
there's
no
spanish
newspaper
there
or
radio
station
doesn't
cover
the
issues
in
the
third
ward
nasni.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes
there
are
in
english.
there
are
many
--
two
spanish
language,
voters
in
the
third
ward
nasni.
now
of
course
the
candidate
speaks
english.
it's
true.
why
has
the
--
i
might
--
let
me
get
into
this.
i
guess
i'm
sort
of
backing
into
this
issue
by
the
tail.
i
suppose
i
might
is
--
i
ought
to
get
into
this
in
one
way
or
another.
let
me
look
at
something
that
was
submitted
in
the
record
below.
the
department
of
justice
has
affidavits
from
candidates
in
spanish
districts,
predominantly
spanish.
he
has
a
kit.
he
has
an
affidavit
by
herman
badillo
who's
margined
it
through
this
based
on
votes
registered
in
all
probability
registered
on
this
particular
act
that
i
might
say,
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
badillo,
i
have
never
heard
of
a
man
who
thought
to
people
voting
him
didn't
understand
the
issues.
but
the
part
that
i'm
making
you
see
is
this.
true,
dominantly
spanish
areas,
there
will
be
spanish
theory.
but
one
of
the
cases
was
in
rochester.
what
about
rochester?
what
about
austin?
there
are
other
cities
besides
new
york
city
and
new
york
state
even
though
many
new
yorkers
don't
think
so.
what
about
all
these
other
localities.
a
person
speaking
only
spanish
is
free
to
move
there,
free
to
live
there,
and
under
the
statute
free
to
vote
there.
how
is
he
going
to
know
what's
going
on
in
the
fourth
ward
nasni
and
nobody's
going
to
print
this
in
spanish
to
each
two
voters
nor
can
he
get
a
translator,
the
translator
all
the
campaign
that
should
have
comes
out
two
days
before
the
election.
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
purely
impossible
to
tell
a
voter
in
the
fourth
ward
nasni
to
a
spanish
language
voters,
what
is
going
on
the
fourth
ward
nasni.
they're
all
in
this
little
upstate
new
york
cities.
all
have
run
municipal
elections,
not
to
mention
connecticut.
of
course
the
law
applies
to
connecticut.
there
were
spanish
language
voters
in
connecticut.
there
are
only
5000.
there
are
no
spanish
language
newspapers.
the
problem
is
that
all
of
the
potentials
have
been
concentrated
in
new
york
city
as
if
new
york
city
were
not
on
the
hub
of
the
universe
but
the
only
place
for
the
universe.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
and
it's
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
alfred
avins
i
don't
know
your
honor,
i'm
not
--
i
wasn't
--
i'm
not
familiar.
there
are
other
states
beside
and
puerto
ricans
live
in
other
states,
i
mean
they
live
at
puerto
rico.
live
in
other
states
beside
and
the
record
shows
here
that
some
of
them
are
residents
connecticut,
50,
60,
whatever
the
case
may
be.
and
of
course
if
this
court
upholds
the
statutes,
they
got
uphold
with
all
the
states.
your
honor
can't
say
the
statute's
constitutional
after
the
71st
election
district
of
new
york,
maybe
your
honor
can
but
i
can't
see
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
the
71st
election
district
of
new
york
and
unconstitutional
at
the
69th
election
district
or
the
42nd
or
the
12th
in
albany
and
it's
constitutional
as
to
one
that's
not
as
to
another
and
the
constitution
of
the
statute
depends
upon
the
circulation
in
how
much
the
issues
are,
how
much
is
discussed.
to
me,
it
would
be
judicial
chaos.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
there
is
telugu
and
tamil,
hindi
--
mr.
alfred
avins
into
the
local
--
into
the
local
language.
mr.
alfred
avins
that
is
--
yes.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
that
is
true
your
honors.
but
the
point
is
--
the
point
that
i'm
making
first
of
all,
of
course,
the
indian
languages
are
reached.
now
for
example,
tamil
is
spoken
in
madras
state.
you
find
every
few
people
speaking
gujarati
in
madras
state.
i'm
glad
your
honor
raised
the
question
in
india
because
i
expect
to
be
publishing
a
book
in
india,
labor
law
next
year.
gujarati,
there
are
cases
that
if
your
honors
if
i'll
file
as
supplemental
brief
your
honor
once,
pointing
out
cases
which
hold
that
it's
illegal
to
transfer
an
employee
from
bombay
to
madras
who
speaks
only
the
native
language,
it's
illegal
because
it
wouldn't
understand
what
was
going
on
that
--
on
in
madras.
mr.
alfred
avins
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
avins
do
you
mean
under
the
territories
clause
or
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
alfred
avins
oh
well,
your
honor
my
position
is
this.
under
the
territories
clause,
congress
is
just
a
super
legislature
of
puerto
rico.
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
--
into
what
i
concede
to
be
a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
learned
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
general
of
puerto
rico's
precise
distribution
of
power
between
congress
and
the
territory
of
puerto
rico.
but
assuming
that
it
was
just
a
territory
pure
and
simple
comes
nothing
but
a
super
legislature
for
puerto
rico.
mr.
alfred
avins
your
honor,
my
conception
of
the
territories
power
is
that
congress
is
absolute
and
plenary
to
power
to
legislate
for
the
territories.
therefore,
it
necessarily
follows
my
--
except
of
course
with
the
bill
of
rights
and
certain
other
general
limitations
could
possible
of
a
bill
of
attainder
of
course,
the
territories
any
more
than
other
place.
but
my
suggestion
to
your
honor
--
my
answer
to
your
honors
question
is
that
it
has
absolute
power
over
the
territories
subject
to
general
limitations
in
the
constitution
and
can
act
as
if
it
were
the
legislature
of
puerto
rico.
therefore
of
course,
it
could
abolish
any
action
by
the
puerto
rican
legislature
which
i
conceive
to
bear
the
same
relation
to
congress
as
a
city
council
of
new
york
bears
the
state
legislature
of
new
york.
the
puerto
rican
legislature
does
not
exercise
sovereignty,
any
kind
of
sovereignty.
it's
a
delegated
power
which
of
course
congress
can
always
revoke
by
passing
an
inconsistent
statute.
mr.
alfred
avins
my
answer
is
yes
but
for
very
special
reason
which
wouldn't
apply
the
other
way.
mr.
alfred
avins
not
--
no.
my
contention
is
absolutely
no
power
or
whatever.
i
go
even
further.
i
make
it
--
i'll
make
a
--
i'll
make
a
suggestion
which
i
think
is
probably
more
absurd
than
that
if
the
state
of
hawaii
decided
that
all
caucasians
were
flabby
lot
and
that
no
person
ought
to
be
entitled
to
vote
in
hawaii
unless
he
could
do
20
push-ups
and
apply
this
uniformly
to
everybody
that
hawaii
would
be
perfectly
some
constitutional
ground
however
much
i
think
--
i
think
is
going
to
absolutely
absurd
to
require.
that
is
i'm
talking
about
the
question
of
power.
mr.
alfred
avins
couldn't
do
a
thing
about
it,
of
course,
the
fifteenth
amendment
feels
(voice
overlap).
mr.
alfred
avins
or
the
nineteenth,
yes,
that
is
the
order
of
course.
that
is
those
special
amendments
which
have
directed
their
attention
to
this.
that
is
--
those
special
amendments
and
i
might
say
this
one
that
i
think
would
be
even
more
raw,
would
be
a
discrimination
based
on
religion.
and
yet,
the
provision
composed
fifteenth
amendment
to
ban
discriminations
based
on
religion
would
knock
that.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
as
long
as
i
think
it
--
mr.
alfred
avins
as
long
as
i
would
think
it
need
to
do
so.
mr.
alfred
avins
as
long
as
i
would
--
as
personally
wrong
as
i
would
think
--
mr.
alfred
avins
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
avins
i
quite
--
that
is
my
position
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
it's
a
question
simply
of
power.
that
is
my
--
if
i
may
make
--
that
is
the
--
congress
cannot
chop
up
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
make
a
toss
green
salad
out
of
it
because
it
doesn't
like
the
original
recipe.
if
it
doesn't
like
the
original
recipe,
it's
got
to
get
a
new
recipe.
the
way
you
get
a
new
recipe
is
article
5.
you
amend
the
constitution.
there
have
been
amendments
proposed
and
some
enacted
a
number
probably
more
in
recent
years
than
any
other
time.
and
there
may
be
amendments
that
i
would
be
much
in
favor
of
but
i
would
be
much
against
that
congress
exercising
a
power
in
unconstitutional
manner
which
it
might
be
very
desirable
to
exercise
in
a
constitutional
manner.
it's
a
question
it
seems
to
me
of
legality.
mr.
alfred
avins
accepting
respectfully
the
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well
it
--
no
your
honor.
my
position
is
this.
it's
the
question
of
original
understanding,
you
see.
mr.
alfred
avins
i
think
the
case
is
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well,
if
the
congress
of
bingham
served
that
the
original
understanding
of
the
due
process
clause.
they
just
asked
the
question
by
congressman
rogers,
andrew
jackson
rogers
was
the
young
democrat
from
new
jersey,
considered
as
a
white
young
democrat.
and
he
replied
that
the
gentleman
can
go
and
read
the
decisions
that's
been
cited
by
the
court
and
he
can
read
decisions.
therefore,
i
would
do
exactly
what
he
--
congressman
bingham
suggests.
i
will
read
all
the
decisions
on
due
process
before
the
civil
war.
mr.
alfred
avins
well
my
arg
--
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
it
wouldn't
because
the
original
understanding
of
course
in
respect
to
voting
is
of
entirely
outside
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question,
you
mean
the
legislation
or
the
right
to
vote?
i
thought
your
honor
was
talking
about
the
right
to
vote.
as
to
the
right
to
vote
it's
not
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
in
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
particular
item
of
legislation
violates
due
process,
the
concepts,
the
general
basic
concepts
in
my
contention
is
one
goes
back
to
the
pre-civil
war
cases,
distills
the
general
basic
concepts
of
due
process
before
at
that
time.
they
are
carried
into
the
due
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
by
bingham's
intent
which
i
consider
to
be
very
clear
from
his
statement
made
in
the
39th
congress.
and
then
that
is
the
content
of
the
due
process
clause,
the
general
principles
of
course.
now,
what
they
are
for
example,
i
think
that
was
in
the
new
york
case
in
1856,
we
supported
the
proposition
if
there
was
a
concept
to
substantive
due
process.
in
fact
there
have
been
numerable
cases
on
due
process.
i
have
an
article
on
--
mr.
alfred
avins
pardon.
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
it
wouldn't
because
it's
very
clear
--
mr.
alfred
avins
or
equal
protection,
yes
that
is
my
contention.
i
might
say
that
of
course
due
process
applies
to
all
persons
which
is
another
good
reason.
bingham
the
said
against
letting
aliens
vote
and
nothing
that
he
did
say,
in
fact,
in
the
admission
of
oregon,
one
of
those
two
reasons
for
voting
against
the
admission
of
oregon,
he
made
a
long
speech
on
the
subject
where
he
said,
this
is
a
recent
new
innovation
which
he
was
dead
set
against
was
contrary
to
the
constitution
and
aliens
were
permitted
to
vote
in
oregon.
he
said
it's
a
recent
innovation
which
maintained
illinois
and
one
or
two
of
the
western
states
to
induce
him
against
the
commerce
to
permit
aliens
to
vote.
he
said
he
was
dead
set
against
it
and
therefore
it's
inconceivable
that
he
attended
to
permit
aliens
to
vote,
contrary
to
his
own
long
well-settled
convictions.
and
therefore
since
the
due
process
clause
protects
aliens
as
well
as
citizens,
it
--
to
me
it's
inconceivable
that
the
due
process
clause
would
protect
the
right
to
vote
for
the
reason
that
otherwise
the
aliens
would
be
entitled
a
right
to
vote.
because
of
course,
as
far
as
protection
of
life,
liberty,
and
property,
you
couldn't
take
that
without
due
process
from
aliens
anyway.
i
think
every
alien
would
be
entitled
if
he
came
to
this
country.
he
would
be
entitled
to
not
have
life,
liberty,
or
property
taking
to
confront
him
without
due
process
of
law.
so
you
see
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
fact
it
brought
back
to
its
historical
understanding
and
fits
very
neatly.
that
is
it
--
it's
--
makes
sense.
you
don't
need
to
try
and
figure
out
some
of
these
odd
--
oddities.
what
would
have
you?
give
everybody
the
protection
as
a
person
99
years
old
entitled
to
go
to
a
first
grade
school,
so
that
you'd
got
to
have
reasonable
classification.
you
have
to
have
all
sorts
of
qualifications.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
original
understanding,
i
think
you
do
not
need
to
have
any
qualifications.
now,
i
know
you
--
i
think
i
have
a
bit
more
time
and
i
just
want
to
say
a
word
since
your
honor
originally
asked
me
and
i
thought
--
i
thought
having
this
obvious
but
as
i
have
a
few
minutes
say
one
or
two
words,
just
about
the
question
of
treaty.
i
do
not
consider
that
congress'
power
under
the
treaty
clause
and
i
think
this
is
well
settled,
to
add
to
any
substantive
power
congress
has
in
the
constitution.
now,
i
think
i
have
set
forth
as
earliest
decisions
in
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
that
--
and
i
think
perhaps
it's
worth
reading
the
little
snibb
--
squib
from
carter
and
grant
that
the
--
i'm
sorry,
pollard
and
hagan
in
3
howard.
now,
the
king
of
spain
--
it
can't
be
admitted
to
the
king
of
spain
could
by
treaty
or
otherwise
impart
of
the
united
states
any
of
his
royal
prerogatives.
much
less
cannot
be
admitted
they
have
the
capacity
to
receive
the
power
to
exercise
them.
every
nation
acquiring
territory
by
treaty
or
otherwise
withholds
its
subject
to
the
constitution
and
laws
of
its
own
government
and
not
according
to
those
that
the
government's
ceding.
therefore,
the
treaty
with
spain
treaty
of
paris
gives
the
united
states
no
power
over
the
territories
and
wouldn't
have
otherwise.
my
contention
is
it
would
have
the
same
power
by
statutes.
and
therefore,
i
say,
that
the
statute
gains
no
additional
efficacy
by
the
united
nations
charter
or
by
world
rule
of
law
conventions
or
by
treaties
or
by
statements
by
the
un
secretary
general
or
resolutions
or
anything.
it's
either
constitutional
within
congress'
power
or
it's
not.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
is
clear
cut.
the
statute
invades
or
reserve
power
of
the
states.
thank
you
your
honor,
that's
all
i
have
to
say.
mr.
alfred
avins
avins,
your
honor.
if
your
honors
please,
i
do
not
intend
to
argue
today
the
reasonableness
of
the
new
york
statute.
i
leave
this
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
and
to
the
first
assistant
and
the
learned
assistant
attorney
general
who
will
argue
after
me.
i
intend
to
spend
my
time
first
on
the
power
over
the
territories
briefly
and
then
to
go
into
what
i
feel
are
the
very
large
questions
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
very
basic
and
broad
questions
which
i
believe
that
this
statute
raises.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
were
shortly
be
frank,
i
will
go
into
the
power
over
the
territories
first
because
i
intend
to
talk
about
that
only
very
briefly
before
i
go
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
which
the
statute
is
purportedly
based.
now,
i
start
out
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
local
or
state
or
municipal
sovereignty,
i
prefer
to
call
it
municipal
sovereignty
and
national
sovereignty.
the
united
states
have
had
territories
since
1789
or
before
that,
the
northwest
territories
which
have
been
considered
to
be
in
wardship
of
the
federal
government.
under
the
power
of
the
territorial
clause,
it
is
my
contention
that
congress
exercises
only
what
we
call
municipal
sovereignty,
a
sovereignty
which
is
substituted
for
state
sovereignty.
in
fact
the
identical
sovereignty,
which
the
states
exercised
as
distinguished
from
national
sovereignty
under
other
powers
of
the
federal
government
which
congress
has
exercised
to
both
the
territories
and
the
states.
and
that
any
power
under
national
sovereignty
must
be
found
elsewhere
other
than
in
the
territories
clause.
now,
the
department
of
justice
has
argued
and
made
much
of
that
i
believe
that
in
other
instances,
congress
has
exercised
extraterritorial
power
of
the
territories.
i
concede
that
point
but
so
have
the
states.
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
state
law
sometimes
has
extraterritorial
effect.
hughes
against
fetter
is
a
recent
and
fairly
good
example
of
this,
i
would
think.
and
my
contention
is
that
congress
has
power
over
the
territory
in
giving
extraterritorial
effect
in
the
identical
circumstances
that
a
state
law
would
have
extraterritorial
effect.
and
at
the
same
type
of
a
state
law
would
be
upheld
as
it
would
be
upheld
under
the
territorial
clause
--
territorial
clause
in
respect
to
its
act
of
territorial
effect.
if
this
were
otherwise,
it
would
follow
that
when
a
territory
which
was
always
considered
to
be
in
temporary
wardship
became
a
state,
it
would
follow
that
a
citizen
of
the
state
would
lose
rights
that
he
had
previously
enjoyed
under
a
statute
under
the
congress'
power
to
govern
the
territories.
be
specific.
let
us
assume
that
puerto
rico
became
a
state.
thereafter,
congress
could
not
pass
the
statute
because
it's
under
the
territories
clause,
because
in
respect
to
that,
it
would
have
no
more
power.
accordingly,
citizens
of
puerto
rico
who
moved
to
new
york
would
lose
rights.
and
i
think
it
anomalous
to
think
that
under
a
territories
clause,
persons
who
move
from
one
state
--
persons
who
are
citizens
of
a
territory
gain
statehood
status
go
down
in
their
rights
rather
than
up.
i
think
it
were
always
deemed
the
citizens
of
territories
certainly
had
no
greater
rights
than
citizens
of
states,
whatever
left
the
rights,
whatever
the
question
of
whether
they
have
left
the
rights
or
not
which
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
into.
they
certainly
had
no
greater
rights.
now,
i
look
at
the
question
this
way.
what
would
happen
if
the
state
of
louisiana
passed
the
law
saying
that
all
citizens
of
louisiana
educated
in
the
french
language
who
moved
to
the
state
of
new
york
or
to
some
other
state
which
had
an
english
language
literacy
test,
would
be
entitled
to
vote
provided
they
have
the
same
level
of
education.
now,
i
think
it's
crystal
clear
that
if
one
state
passed
such
a
law,
it
would
not
be
enforceable
in
another
state
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
because
i
do
not
think
that
a
state
can
give
its
own
law
extraterritorial
effect.
therefore,
i
conclude,
that
if
that
is
so,
the
identical
point
follows
in
respect
to
a
law
of
congress
under
the
territories
clause.
accordingly,
the
point
i
therefore
make
is,
that
congress
could
not
as
he
said
it
and
didn't
say
it
was
but
could
not,
have
passed
the
statute
under
the
territories
clause.
and
for
this
reason,
even
if
it
were
permissible
to
consider
this
statute
merely
under
the
territories
clause,
a
point
which
i
do
not,
even
if
it
was
permissible
to
do
so,
the
statute
would
not
be
valid
under
the
territories
clause.
for
the
reason,
that
is
an
excess
of
congress'
power
to
pass
because
it
is
not
an
exercise
of
municipal
legislation.
it
is
not
an
exercise
of
legislation
similar
to
a
statute
for
example
which
says
that
a
gas
in
a
--
an
automobile
who
had
an
accident
in
puerto
rico
who
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence
could
not
recover
against
the
host.
new
york
of
course,
would
probably
require
to
enforce
that
under
full
faith
and
credit.
and
that
i
can
see
that
the
supremacy
clause
simply
carries
over
the
notion
of
a
full
faith
and
credit
clause
in
respect
to
this
matter
to
which
it
is
the
identical
type
of
clause
in
respect
to
this
matter.
mr.
alfred
avins
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
this
time
your
honor,
i
intend
to
devote
the
remaining
period
of
my
time
to
the
general
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
its
application
in
this
case,
and
what
i
respectfully
conceived
to
be
this
court's
duty
and
congress'
duty
in
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
taken
broadly
and
without
regard
to
the
question
of
reasonableness.
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
your
honor.
in
my
estimation,
the
reason
i'm
not
discussing
that
is
because
i
conceive
that
the
treaty
clause
gives
congress
no
independent
power.
and
that
if
the
treaty
is
outside
of
the
general
scope
of
congress'
power
elsewhere,
congress
cannot
increase
its
power
by
making
a
treaty
with
the
foreign
country.
i
believe
that
your
honors
observe
this
fact
in
reid
against
covert
and
therefore,
i
do
not
believe
in
accordance
with
long
settled
precedent
and
i
think
in
accordance
with
the
general
nature
of
the
government
that
the
treaty
power
is
not
a
grant
of
substantive
power
above
and
beyond
that
which
congress
is
allowed
in
those
foreign
affairs
which
would
have
by
statute.
therefore,
i
will
not
argue
--
and
in
addition,
as
i
believe
i've
mentioned
before,
i
will
not
argue
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
the
new
york
statute
leaving
it
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
york.
i
might
note
preliminarily
that
the
department
of
justices'
briefs
has
a
great
many
statistics
on
puerto
rico.
i
believe
that
the
habit
of
using
statistics
in
briefs
started
with
muller
against
oregon
by
the
late
mr.
justice
brandeis
that
of
an
attorney.
and
i
think
has
increased
to
the
point
in
which
appendices
and
now
all
statistics
and
no
constitution.
as
your
honors
know,
i
have
made
a
distinct
departure
from
that.
my
appendix
contains
all
constitution
in
those
statistics.
and
i
leave
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
and
to
the
department
of
justice
the
question
of,
how
many
immigrants
there
was
average
annual
rainfall
in
puerto
rico
and
also
with
some
other
statistics
which
in
my
estimation
are
wholly
irrelevant.
the
general
question,
as
i
conceive
it,
is
what
was
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
questions
of
this
character?
before
i
go
into
that,
i
intend
to
got
start
out
which
i
consider
to
be
a
useful
starting
point
with
the
dred
scott
case
which
was
cited
by
judge
mcgowan
below
but
in
a
somewhat
different
context
that
i
am
going
to
discuss.
i
might
say
that
i
consider
these
questions
fundamental
and
as
broad
as
the
hills
and
not
nearly
as
narrow
as
i
believe
my
learned
opponents
contend.
first
of
all,
what
were
the
questions
decided
in
the
dred
scott
case.
one,
the
missouri
compromises
unconstitutional
because
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
two,
that
negroes
were
not
citizens
under
article
4
section
2
of
the
old
interstate
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
both
of
these
decisions
were
contrary
to
what
i
call
egregious
historical
facts
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
of
the
present
time
it
is
believe
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
in
accordance
with
history.
now,
the
two
things
the
radical
republicans
cited
to
show
that
these
decisions
were
contrary
to
egregious
historical
facts
were
one,
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
the
fact
of
the
northwest
ordinance
which
it
could
not
be
presumed
congress
intended
to
repeal
by
the
fifth
amendment
is
almost
contemporaneous.
and
two,
in
respect
to
article
4
section
2,
the
fact
that
in
june
25th,
1778
south
carolina
delegation
moved
to
insert
the
word
‘white'
in
the
premises
of
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
this
was
defeated
by
a
vote
of
eight
to
two
with
one
state
divided.
now,
the
radicals
charged
and
repeatedly
throughout
the
congressional
of
debates
that
the
dred
scott
decision
was
not
in
fact
a
judicial
decision.
that
it
was
a
political
decision
designed
to
support
the
buchanan
version
of
a
great
society
and
slave
holding
ideology.
and
that
it
was
designed
to
one,
commit
the
extension
of
slavery
into
the
territories;
and
two,
most
important
in
respect
to
article
4
section
2,
which
is
necessary
to
an
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
was
designed
to
keep
free
negroes
who
were
believed
to
be
the
natural
leaders
of
slavery
out
of
sovereign
states.
and
i
think
the
horror
incident
which
your
honors
may
remember
in
1844
is
a
good
example
of
the
dread
which
the
sovereign
states
have
for
having
freed
negroes
declared
citizens
under
article
4
section
2.
now,
what
was
the
radical
reaction
to
this?it
was,
in
blunt
terms
that
the
tory
court,
were
making
political
speeches
to
support
the
buchanan
and
pierce
administration.
now,
when
the
radical
swept
into
power,
the
political
tide
turned,
of
course.
and
the
political
supports
of
this
court
as
an
institution
were
withdrawn
and
decisions
how
to
stand
on
the
question
of
whether
they
were
on
the
bedrock
of
the
constitution.
and
i
think
history
supports
my
position
that
what
the
tory
--
or
the
position
of
the
radical
but
what
the
tory
court
did
was
to
mortgage
the
political
future
of
the
court
with
the
then
current
ideology,
which
when
swept
away,
swept
away
the
only
assets
that
this
court
had
to
with
the
prestige
among
lawyers
of
all
political
factions
based
on
decisions,
based
on
the
law.
and
once
those
mortgages
were
foreclosed,
the
court
was
left
without
assets.
of
the
political
nature,
of
course,
congress
retained
its
power
over
the
person,
the
executive
over
the
sword
that
this
court
has
nothing
but
power
over
the
law.
and
i
think
the
radicals
in
their
speech
has
pointed
out,
that
as
long
as
this
court
--
that
as
long
as
the
political
branches
of
the
government
support
this
court's
position
that
the
question
of
whether
it
makes
decisions
based
on
the
law,
current
ideology
is
irrelevant,
but
that
it
needs
us
--
withdrawn
by
a
change
in
ideological
occurrence,
the
result
is
that
decisions
are
swept
away.
and
the
court
--
the
decisions
are
then
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
whether
they
are
based
on
the
law.
and
the
fact
that
the
tory
court
did
in
fact
shore
--
shear
itself
with
the
power
to
do
anything
is
i
think
exemplified
an
ex
parte
merryman
where
the
lincoln
administration
tore
up
mr.
justice
taney's
writs
and
used
as
it
a
confetti
and
in
ex
parte
mccardle
where
the
radical
congress
simply
barred
this
court
from
many
review.
a
very
legitimate
one
is
protecting
the
south
against
the
excess
of
reconstruction.
now,
i
want
to
say
to
your
honors
very
respectfully
that
i
see
analogies
to
that
case
today.
and
i
want
to
say
that
in
this
case,
there
are
egregious
historical
facts
which
support
the
position
that
i
take
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
covers
only
what
were
known
in
1866
as
civil
rights
and
not
political
rights
at
all.
these
facts
are
contained
in
approximately
100
pages
of
legislative
history
appendix
which
i
have
filed
with
your
honors.
and
i
will
say
that
i
think
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
department
of
justice
to
burn
the
congressional
gloss
if
they
would
convince
anybody
that
the
original
understanding
was
in
accordance
with
this
statute.
now,
i
believe
what
is
ultimately
at
stake
is
the
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
which
is
your
honor
may
know
rests
on
the
historical
compromises
of
1876
and
'94
in
which
the
south
generally
agreed
not
to
contest
ratification
in
return
for
a
construction
which
was
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
original
understanding
which
is
very
narrow.
i
think
erie
railroad
company
against
tompkins
and
the
opinion
of
the
late
mr.
justice
brandeis
is
a
prototype
of
what
happens,
because
in
that
case,
the
flowering
of
swift
against
tyson,
as
i
see
it
in
response
to
the
needs
of
big
business
after
the
civil
war,
and
i
think
i
may
say
the
excesses
under
that
decision
was
such
as
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
an
examination
of
the
original
understanding,
and
of
course,
the
tail
going
with
the
head
the
fifteenth
amendment
ratification
rests
with
the
fourteenth.
now,
i
feel
entirely
justified
in
saying
that
this
statute
cuts
a
deep
gash
in
the
original
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
it
is
back
from
where
i
want
to
go
to
and
that
to
which
i
want
to
spend
my
time,
of
course.
and
i
would
like
to
make
my
position
as
clear
as
i
can
in
respect
to
this
question
of
original
understanding.
i
do
not
view
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
an
accordion
which
expands
or
contracts
in
respect
of
who's
playing
the
tune.
i
view
it
in
respect
as
a
fixed
document.
and
my
position
is
that
the
beginning,
middle,
and
end
of
all
constitutional
inquiry
is
the
original
understanding
of
the
framers
and
of
the
legislative
debates
are
clear.
they
are
conclusive.
cases
in
the
court
are
superfluous
and
those
contraries
are
erroneous.
and
for
this
reason,
i
intend
to
go
to
the
original
understanding
and
to
that
alone.
now,
i
would
start
out
by
saying
that
trying
to
vote
the
statute
on
the
equal
protection
clause
is
like
trying
to
carry
the
washington
monument
in
the
wheelbarrow.
your
honors
cannot
make
it
fit
because
the
equal
protection
clause
is
much
too
narrow.
it
would
--
in
my
estimation,
it
would
require
a
plastic
surgery
on
the
equal
protection
clause
to
sustain
the
statute
then
i
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well
i'm
not
--
i
think
your
honor
that
they
are
equal
to
the
washington
monument.
how
much,
i'm
not
entirely
certain.
mr.
alfred
avins
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
quite
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
avins
well
i
--
i
take
the
position
of
the
original
standing
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
what
were
known
in
1866
as
political
rights.
mr.
alfred
avins
under
the
original
understanding,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
avins
nor
those,
there
are
others.
mr.
alfred
avins
pardon,
sir?
mr.
alfred
avins
well
as
far
as
that
case
is
concerned
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
an
amount
of
more
than
one
power
that
was
also
i
believe
that
power
under
the
--
the
power
to
control
article
1,
i
believe,
section
2,
federal
power
over
the
times,
places
and
manners
of
holding
election.
and
therefore,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
not
an
entirely
different
inquiry.
but
i'm
now
going
to
the
basic
question
of
what
--
mr.
alfred
avins
yes
your
honor,
let
me
--
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
raise
one
point
which
i
don't
--
which
the
department
of
justice
raised
in
its
brief
but
in
a
different
way.
the
department
of
justice
cited
in
support
of
those
cases
the
enforcement
act
of
1870.
now,
i
did
not
notice
this
any
place
but
i
want
to
make
one
point
about
that.
as
reported
out
and
passed
in
the
houses,
it
was
reported
out
from
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
shared
by
congressman
john
a.
bingham
of
ohio
who
drafted
the
first
section
of
fourteenth
amendment
often
the
declaration
of
citizenship.
it
would
made
--
it
was
made
a
criminal
offense
for
state
officials
to
fail
to
collect
poll
taxes
from
negroes.
the
only
other
offense
is
i
think
was
section
2
was
the
failure
of
--
i'm
sorry,
the
failure
to
register;
failure
to
register
or
to
collect
poll
taxes.
it
was
broadened
in
by
senator
stewart
in
the
senate
from
the
judiciary
committee
on
the
grounds
of
sovereign
state
by
bringing
up
other
prerequisites.
but
originally
the
very
act
possibly
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments,
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
the
state
--
for
the
state
officials,
election
officials
to
fail
to
collect
poll
taxes
from
the
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well
your
honor,
i
--
i
want
to
get
into
that
in
terms
of
the
original
meaning
of
equal
protection.
and
then
--
and
i
do
fully
intend
to
get
into
this
question.
mr.
alfred
avins
there
are
--
the
due
process
clause
i
don't
think
anybody
considers
to
be
relevant.
i've
seen
nothing
that
anybody
can
see
the
irrelevance
so
i
deal
with
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
which
granted
privilege
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
citizens
only
and
equal
protection
which
is
granted
to
all
persons,
a
distinction
which
i
think
is
very
significant.
now,
i
start
out
by
detailing
what
i
believe
the
original
understanding
of
the
word
‘protection'.
now
this
is
the
keyword.
not
equal,
it
doesn't
mean
equal
rights,
equal
benefits,
equal
privileges,
it
means
equal
protection.
it
doesn't
mean
the
equal
protect
--
it
doesn't
mean
the
protection
of
equal
law
that
means
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
just
a
pair
of
alligator
is
different
from
an
alligator
pair.
the
word
‘protection'
comes
from
the
original
draft
of
bingham
speech
and
bingham's
draft,
giving
congress
the
power
to
enforce
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
derived
from
article
4
section
2
and
equal
protection
of
life,
liberty
and
property.
and
bingham
speeches,
i
think
read
carefully
show
that
it
meant
protection
of
the
right
to
life
which
is
every
person
even
an
alien
baby
is
entitled
so
you
couldn't
take
the
life
of
a
baby.
protection
of
liberty
which
i
think
every
person
is
entitled
to
and
protection
of
property.
and
bingham
speeches
show
it
meant
property
acquired
lawfully
and
obtained
lawfully
personal
property,
as
in
the
cases
like
roth
against
slaughter
which
he
has
cited
in
his
original
speeches.
so
your
honors
originally,
protection,
the
equal
protection
clause
was
designed
not
only
for
aliens,
for
travelers,
for
resident
aliens,
for
everybody.
that's
why
the
word
‘person'
is
there.
and
of
course
i
might
say
this
that
under
the
original
concept
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
no
reasonable
classification
is
necessary
because
every
--
i
think
one
can
conceive
that
every
person
is
entitled
to
the
same
protection
of
life,
liberty,
and
property
which
every
other
person
is
entitled
to.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
case
as
far
as
its
original
understanding
is
concerned.
that
is
to
say
it
is
confined
exactly,
it
was
merely
a
redraft,
your
honors
may
recall
that
the
bingham
draft
was
postponed
in
the
house.
it
was
postponed
because
the
majo
--
many
of
the
republicans,
hutchinson
and
hale
and
other
republican
congresses
felt
it
gave
congress
too
much
power.
so
it
was
postponed
and
redrafted
to
be
a
negative
limitation
on
the
state
similar
to
the
limitation
which
the
old
sec
--
limitations
of
article
1
section
10
were.
therefore,
in
my
estimation
the
equal
protection
clause
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
at
all
with
this
case
of
any
kind.
i
take
that
broad
ground.
i
realized
the
broader
ground
than
perhaps
it's
been
put
forth
in
recent
years.
but
i
think
it's
the
correct
ground
when
one
goes
back
to
be
with
you
on
the
stand.
now,
let
me
give
some
illustrations.
in
1870,
the
enforcement
act
was
passed,
just
passed
largely
to
protect
chinese
in
california
who
were
not
permitted
to
be
witnesses
in
cases.
and
the
right
to
be
a
witness
was
a
protection
because
of
course,
if
a
person
could
not
be
a
witness,
it
means
--
and
some
of
these
speeches
show
that
he
could
be
robbed
with
impunity.
and
therefore,
it
was
necessary
to
protect
him
in
this
right.
this
is
part,
i
think,
of
the
word
‘protection'.
i
therefore
deem
that
reasonable
classification
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
equal
protection
clause
at
all.
now,
i
turn
to
what
i
considered
to
be
the
more
important
clause,
to
which
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
where
did
it
come
from?
what
was
it
meant
to
do?
now,
the
reason
for
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
was
the
defect
in
the
--
according
to
bingham
with
the
defect
in
the
original
constitution
that
congress
had
no
power
to
enforce
article
4
section
2,
that
the
necessary
improper
clause
that
not
give
it
any
power
to
enforce
article
4
section
2.
its
derogation
comes
from
two
different
sources,
although
originally
drafted
to
give
congress
that
is
the
concepts,
i'm
sorry,
i
shouldn't
give
the
derogation.
derogation
comes
straight
from
article
4
section
2.
and
bingham
speeches
indicate
very
clearly
that
he
believed
there
was
an
ellipsis
in
article
4
section
2,
unlike
the
democrats
who
felt
was
just
designed
to
prevent
a
discrimination
against
out
of
state
residents.
he
believe
that
the
word
of
citi
--
of
the
united
states
should
be
inserted
off
to
the
words
‘privileges',
that
is
so
what
should
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens.
and
after
that
of
the
united
states
in
the
several
states
in
of
the
united
states
being
the
ellipsis.
the
question
therefore
boils
down
to
what
was
bingham's
concept
of
privileges,
where
did
they
get
it
from.
what
did
they
believe
it
contain
because
even
if
it
contained
something
different
by
the
old
framers,
the
questions
what
went
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
also
one
of
radicals
believe
it
contends.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
radicals
believe
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
which
is
of
course
broader
than
the
equal
protection
clause
since
they
were
only
right
for
citizens,
well
how
to
be
a
citizen
derive
any
protection
from
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
protecting
what
were
known
an
1866
as
civil
rights,
that
is
to
say
not
political
rights
but
rather
civil
rights
as
we
know
in
1866.
now,
i
think
i
am
supported
by
many
--
by
a
multitude
in
this
number
of
citations
which
i
have
in
my
appendices
and
which
i
shall
not
unless
your
honors
are
particularly
interested
to
meet
legislative
appendices
which
i
have
filed
with
this
court.
but
i
want
to
call
your
honors'
attention
for
example
to
a
footnote
which
i
added,
to
the
report
of
the
joint
committee
on
reconstruction
of
1866,
which
i
think
shows
very
clearly
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
reported
out
to
protect
only
civil
rights.
civil
rights
at
that
time
were
believed
to
be
what
are
known
as
today
as
natural
rights,
or
that
is
to
what
--
i'm
sorry
what
were
known
then
as
natural
rights
today's
concept
of
natural
rights
might
be
a
good
deal
of
difference.
but
they
were
intended
to
protect
what
were
known
at
that
time
as
natural
rights.
and
they
were
derived
from
two
sources
one,
the
decision
of
this
that
justice
washington
on
the
circuit
in
1823
in
corfield
against
coryell,
which
i
assume
is
your
honors
are
all
familiar
with
then
i
shall
go
through,
and
two,
protections
existing
already
in
the
constitution
itself,
that
is
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
were
deemed
to
be
those
protections
which
existed
in
the
constitution,
protection
against
bills
of
attainder,
and
so
forth,
and
many
protections.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
this
discussion
between
if
there's
a
(inaudible)
and
there's
a
famine
about
whether
all
the
bills
of
rights
or
just
part
where
--
but
i
think
at
least
some
of
it
whether
it's
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
i
don't
think
any
of
them
went
to
due
process
clause.
but
i
think
it
all
went
to
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
for
this
authority
i
cite
a
statement
by
senator
pomeroy
in
1870
that
aliens
have
no
right
to
petition
the
united
states
senate.
it
was
a
privilege
of
citizens
alone,
one
of
the
many
aspects
i
think
which
shed
light
as
far
as
the
original
understanding
of
the
framers
are
concerned.
now,
at
that
what
were
considered
to
be
civil
rights
the
right
to
work,
the
right
to
travel,
the
right
to
raise
a
family,
the
right
to
do
business,
to
buy
and
sell
and
own
property,
that
is
what
were
considered
an
--
and
have
security
therefore,
the
right
to
bring
a
suit,
lawsuit,
or
the
things
that
were
considered
in
1866
to
be
civil
rights.
among
the
things
excluded
for
what
we
known
as
conventional
rights.
and
i
might
say
again
i'm
supported
in
this
if
your
honors
may
know
of
the
colloquy
that
senator
lyman
trumbull,
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
1872,
hired
with
senator
george
edmund,
member
of
the
judiciary
committee
in
which
he
said
that
this
was
confined
to
civil
rights
and
does
not
include
the
right
to
go
to
school,
does
not
include
the
right
to
vote,
does
not
include
any
conventional
rights,
it
just
included
what
were
known
as
basic
or
natural
rights.
now,
i
suppose
the
question
must
be
asked,
why
not
--
why
then
put
this
back
into
article
4
section
--
if
it's
article
4
section
2,
why
put
it
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
short
answer
was
that
as
part
of
the
guarantees,
post
civil
war
guarantees,
cong
--
the
radical
congress
demanded
that
the
south
give
it
the
power
to
enforce
in
full
these
rights.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
fifth
section
which
i
believe
has
been
argued
at
some
length
in
this
case.
my
position
as
to
the
fifth
section
is
i
think
quite
simple.
the
power
to
enforce
does
not
include
the
power
to
amend.
the
power
to
enforce
does
not
include
the
power
to
define.
the
power
to
enforce
is
simply
the
power
to
enforce
what
is
in
the
other
section.
in
fact,
there
were
some
arguments
by
the
democrats,
the
power
to
enforce
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
first
section
at
all
because
it
was
the
third
section,
a
really
controversial
section,
which
congress
demanded
the
power
to
enforce
as
spevack
confederates
out
of
public
office.
now,
my
contention
is
that
since
in
1866
and
1868,
states
were
free
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
make
up
such
qualifications
for
voting
the
date
it
shows,
that
they
have
the
identical
freedom
today.
that
is
to
say
that
constitution
--
principles
of
the
constitution
remains
fixed
until
amended
in
the
manner,
the
precise
manner
which
is
set
out
in
article
5.
this
is
what
i
think
is
the
basic
issue
in
respect
to
this
statute
and
in
respect
to
this
case.
that
is
to
say
that
the
historical
intent
remains
fixed.
i
think
i
can
draw
an
analogy
in
this
way
with
a
favorite
little
story
by
radical
republicans
in
1850,
the
1850s
about
a
vermont
judge.
they
were
fond
of
citing
his
decision.
he
was
asked
to
return
a
slave
under
the
fugitive
slave
law.
he
demanded
proof
of
ownership
which
is
entitled
to
under
a
fugitive
slave
law.
he
was
given
a
bail
of
sale
by
the
owner
but
made
out
by
the
prior
owner.
he
said
to
the
judge
that
he
would
only
recognize
the
bill
of
sale
from
his
maker.
and
so
i
say,
it
was
the
same
thing
in
respect
to
the
constitution
that
the
powers
must
be
found
under
the
grounds
of
the
makers.
that
is
the
only
place,
not
of
present
congressional
statute.
now,
in
my
estimation
the
statute
is
such
noble
theory
that
it
should
be
patented
in
the
patent
office
except
that
i
do
not
know
that
it
would
meet
this
court's
test
of
utility.
but
i
certainly
think
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
congress
has
ever
tried
to
amend
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
the
guise
of
enforcing
especially
in
respect
of
political
rights.
i
might
say
this.
i
believe
in
the
legislative
history
appendix
which
i've
submitted,
which
i
wrote
the
state
of
virginia,
my
also
--
my
article
in
stanford
law
review,
and
in
the
appendix
which
i
submitted
here.
i
pointed
out
very
clearly
that
during
the
debates
on
the
fifteenth
amendment,
repeating
attempts
were
made
to
ban
states
using
qualifications
based
on
literacy,
property,
religion.
i
might
say
in
respect
to
religion
there
was
a
very
raw
example
because
roman
catholic
was
forbidden
to
hold
office
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
very
raw
example.
one
is
quite
often
cited
with
respect
to
an
english
language
literacy
test,
we
don't
have
to
look
very
far.
the
state
of
massachusetts
as
well
as
connecticut
had
an
english
language
literacy
test
and
its
purpose
was
not
as
benign
as
the
new
york
statute
is
here.
its
purpose
was
to
keep
out
irish
democratic
immigrants
away
from
the
polling
booth.
it
was
a
no
nothing
product.
it
was
kindly
talk
about
during
the
reconstruction
period
and
yet
it
was
maintained
during
this
entire
period.
rhode
island
had
a
better
trick.
they
require
that
all
naturalized
citizens
own
land
in
rhode
islands.
and
as
one
demo
--
senator
bland
said
of
missouri,
there
wasn't
very
much
man
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
for
anybody
to
own.
the
rhode
island
--
senator
anthony
of
rhode
island
said
that
he
wouldn't
let
the
fourth
--
he
wouldn't
vote
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
rhode
island
legislature
wouldn't
ratify
unless
congress
took
out
the
property
qualifications.
that
is
a
ban
on
property
qualifications.
so
they
did.
and
in
respect
to
--
in
respect
to
other,
the
nativity
qualification
of
the
west
coast
republicans
were
dead
set
against
letting
any
chinese
vote.
that's
why
the
nativity
was
taken
out.
according
to
senator
aaron
sargent,
a
california
republican,
i'm
now
citing
the
majority
republicans,
i'm
not
citing
the
democrats
for
these
propositions.
and
so
the
original
draft,
the
wilson
draft
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
waddled
away.
now,
there
was
a
proposed
draft
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
give
everybody
an
equal
vote.
it
was
the
original
bingham
draft.
and
it
was
defeated
very
resoundingly.
now,
if
bingham
had
put
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
everybody
is
entitled
to
an
equal
vote
or
an
equal
vote
without
--
based
on
a
reasonable
classification
why
should
he
make
the
same
amendment
in
the
fifteenth
two
years
later
superfluous.
i
think
it
defies
common
sense
to
say
that
the
original
--
original
framers
who
would
make
all
of
this
enactment
absolutely
which
would
absolutely
be
nonsense
in
comparison
with
what
they
actually
did
thereafter.
that
is
to
say
the
original
debates
of
1866
are
reinforced
by
everything
that
the
framers
did
from
one
end
to
the
other.
and
it
is
on
this
that
i
rest
as
to
the
original
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
department
of
justice
has
submitted
four
little
items
on
which
you
understand.
i
believe
one
of
them
is
a
little
tidbit
from
senator
howard
which
is
i
think
so
broad
and
vague
as
virtually
meaningless.
i
have
a
material
from
senator
howard
which
i
shouldn't
read
to
your
honors
because
it's
in
the
appendices
that
i've
filed
which
shows
very
clearly
repeatedly
he
said
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
franchise.
in
--
they
also
have
a
couple
of
statements
by
democrats
and
some
of
the
states
saying
what
a
horrible
thing
this
is
going
to
be.
i
think
they're
clearly
political
speeches
and
i
think
we
can
ignore
them.
it
is
not
--
the
justice
department's
brief
does
not
cite
but
i
think
i
want
to
go
into
for
a
moment
because
it's
probably
familiar
to
you
your
honor
an
article
by
mr.
ben
allstar
in
the
law
review
journal
--
i'm
sorry,
the
supreme
court
reviewed
last
year.
unfortunately,
mr.
ben
allstar
has
had
unhappy
habit
of
putting
a
material
that
he
finds
favorable.
i've
put
in
a
material
in
these
appendices
which
are
both
favorable
and
a
little
bit
which
i
deemed
to
be
unfavorable
to
with
boswell
speech,
that
is
congressman
boswell,
right
before
the
enactment
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
there
were
--
i'm
sorry
and
senator
edmund.
i
want
to
take
up
these
two
people
because
they're
the
only
people
who
are
unfavorable
to
my
position.
i
think
really
except
for
the
democrats.
as
for
boswell,
i
think
i
can
explain
this
very
easily
though
he
--
this
admitted
to
by
--
he
never
practiced
law
until
long
after
he
left
the
senate
and
house.
so
he
really
wasn't
a
lawyer.
as
to
edmunds,
though
he
said
originally
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
not
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
privileges
and
immunities
clause
did
grant
congress
some
power
over
the
right
to
vote
to
with
the
right
to
prevent
discrimination
against
negroes.
thereafter,
he
changed
his
position
in
1872
concurred
with
the
rest
in
saying
that
privileges
and
immunities
clause
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
to
vote.
and
therefore,
i
take
the
broad
grounds
that
there
is
really
no
substantial
material
in
the
debates,
it's
not
a
question
of
weighing
them.
there
is
no
substantial
material
in
the
debates
which
is
contrary
to
the
position
that
the
original
understanding
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
anything
other
than
what
was
known
as
a
civil
right
in
1866
and
1868.
and
therefore,
i
prompt
my
feet
firmly
on
the
original
understanding
--
on
the
original
understanding
of
these
amendments.
now,
i
might
say
that
several
of
the
gentlemen
who
have
preceded
me
have
indicated
that
they
belie
--
mr.
alfred
avins
which
words,
the
protection
of
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
alfred
avins
equal
protection
of
the
laws.because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
was
originally
intended
was
clearly
protection.
that
is
to
say
if
one
goes
back
to
the
mischief,
it
is
not
difficult
to
realize
why
the
word
protection
was
used.
let
me
give
your
honor
an
example.
a
single
example
i
think
will
suffice
both
of
the
use
of
the
word
person
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
use
of
the
word
protection.
in
1850,
the
supreme
court
of
california
decided
that
under
the
law
of
california,
chinese
were
assimilated
to
indians
and
were
not
permitted
to
testify
in
court.
in
1860,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
field
later
in
this
court
who
held
that
under
the
law,
if
a
white
man
beat
up
a
china
man
and
robbed
him
in
california
and
the
only
witnesses
were
chinese,
the
white
man
had
to
go
free.
now,
senator
conness
said
this
is
becoming
a
very
serious
problem
because
southern
born
confederates
became
highly
men
in
california.
he
used
another
term,
i
don't
remember,
and
then
he
said
they
were
just
plainly
highly
men.
and
what
they
would
do,
they
go
around
robbing
chinese
and
then
of
course
they
could
never
be
brought
to
book
because
the
only
witnesses
were
chinese
and
they
were
excluded
as
witnesses.
your
honors
you
may
remember,
that
under
the
old
slave
codes,
negroes
could
not
be
witnesses
where
whites
were
parties
whether
four
against
white.
this
is
one
of
the
objects
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
of
course
these
things
are
all
forgotten
because
these
laws
have
been
--
are
obsolete
--
i
mean
not
been
in
existence
for
100
years
and
so
of
course
the
original
mischief
have
been
forgotten.
but
at
that
time,
this
was
the
original
--
these
were
the
original
mischief
that
it
was
not
the
same
protection.
before
--
mr.
alfred
avins
i'm
afraid
to
say
that
it's
narrow
even
than
that.
that
is
to
say
that
privileges
and
immunities
clause
could
be
substituted
for
civil
rights
and
in
fact
the
civil
rights
act
though
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
of
debate
about
where
enforcing
the
thirteenth
amendment,
i
think
it's
very
clear
and
senator
lot
morrill
of
1872
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
civil
rights,
that
the
act
of
'66
really
rested
on
article
4
section
2.
the
big
quarrels
whether
congress
could
enforce
article
4
section
2.
that
is
to
say
if
negroes
were
freed,
were
they
therefore
ipso
facto
were
entitled
to
article
--
benefits
of
article
4
section
2.
this
--
that's
why
you
have
a
declaration
of
citizenship
in
the
--
first
sentence
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
now,
the
word
civil
rights
was
taken
out
of
the
act
which
your
honor
you
may
remember
because
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
on
the
subject
to
whether
voting
was
a
civil
right
and
senator
--
congressman
wilson,
the
later
senator
wilson,
congressman
wilson
of
ireland,
chairman
of
judiciary
committee
said
“no”
and
then
bingham
said
“yes”
and
what
it
said,
well
maybe
or
maybe
it's
too
broad
or
columbus
delano
of
ohio
said,
“this
is
pretty
broad,
who
knows
what's
going
to
be
interpreted
at.”
so
wilson
finally
said,
“alright,
we're
going
to
take
the
word
‘civil
rights'
right
out
in
just
list
the
‘right'.”
but
my
contention
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
you
could
replace
privileges
and
immunities
clause
with
the
word
‘civil
rights'
which
is
i
say
included
one,
the
right
in
corfield
against
coryell
and
two,
rights
derived
from
the
constitution
itself.
as
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
that's
narrow
still.
not
all
civil
rights
are
protected
by
the
equal
protection
clause
just
those
which
give
protection
to
life,
liberty,
or
property.
it's
a
very
narrow.
it's
a
very
little
clause.
i
might
say
that
the
whole
first
section
was
utterly
uncontroversial.
the
second
section
wasn't
very
controversial,
with
the
big
fight
on
the
third
section
on
whether
ex-confederates
should
be
disabled
from
holding
the
office
but
nobody
cared
about
the
first
section
being
to
surplusage,
it
was
just
a
little
unimportant
clause.
it's
just
very
basic.
mr.
alfred
avins
it
would
protect
persons.
first
of
all,
it
would
protect
aliens.
it
would
take
travels.
in
bingham,
as
an
early
as
bingham
speech
against
the
admission
of
oregon
in
the
35th
congress
second
session,
i
think
it
was
about
page
900
something
in
1859,
he
indicates
very
clear
that
even
strangers
are
entitled
to
some
protection.
and
he
repeated
this
recurring
theme
like
a
broken
record
over
and
over
through
the
debate.
even
strangers
get
something.
in
fact,
the
word
‘persons'
have
been
so
broadly
interpreted
that
i
might
say
this,
that
in
president
johnson's
veto
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
he
makes
a
point
that
he
conceived
the
word
‘persons'
to
include
corporations.
so
that
--
but
i
think
it
was
considered
on
all
sides
that
they've
included
aliens.
that's
the
reason
for
in
effect
duplicating
some
of
the
rights
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
the
equal
protection
and
the
due
process.
namely,
aliens
get
something
because
there
was
the
state,
it
was
believed
that
the
state
would
not
protect
aliens
either
even
of
these
basic
rights.
and
i
think
the
state
of
california
is
an
excellent
example.
the
history
of
the
state
of
california
is
an
excellent
example,
the
pre-antebellum
history
of
the
state
of
california
is
an
excellent
example,
and
perhaps
the
post-antebellum
to
some
extent
whatever
was
on
the
democratic
administration.
and
it
was
this
constant
discussion
about
democratic
legislature
discriminating
against
chinese
refusing
them
protection,
refusing
them
permission
to
testify
even
the
state
is
refusing
them
and
some
state
they
couldn't
be
parties,
they
couldn't
sue
the
law.
if
the
man
hits
you
on
the
nose,
it's
tough
luck,
you
couldn't
sue
in
court.
so
if
you
go
back
to
the
original
mischief,
there
is
a
very
good
reason
for
these
clauses.
and
my
contention
is
that
--
i
might
say
that
i
consider
as
a
contention
of
--
a
moment
where
it
comes
to
say
contention
of
the
legality,
that
is
to
say
that
it's
a
requirement
of
legality
that
a
constitution
be
interpreted
in
accordance
with
the
original
understanding
and
not
like
it.
they
once
said
in
the
alabama
lawyer
of
light
check
that
it
has
got
to
be
--
it
means
exactly
the
same
as
it
meant
in
1866,
of
course,
scientific
changes
simply
mean
that
you
substitute
one
scientific
methods
for
another
as
an
airplane
that
is
same
as
a
train
for
purposes
of
general
principles.
but
the
general
principles
remain
the
same
although
it
was
known
in
1866,
people
go
to
schools
were
known
--
these
are
--
all
these
things
were
known.
that
is
my
point.
and
now
i
might
say
that
i
--
some
of
the
gentlemen
on
the
other
side
have
said
that
voting
--
they
think
voting
is
very
fundamental.
i
don't
know
that
voting
is
as
fundamental
as
my
learned
opponent's
belief.
i
think
the
right
to
drive
a
car
for
example
is
more
fundamental
than
the
right
to
vote
because
in
those
places
of
the
country
you'd
never
even
get
to
the
polls
without
a
car.
and
i
might
say
that
i
think
if
we
took
a
survey
in
the
country
is
to
whether
people
would
rather
hitchhike
imposed
of
pay
$1.50
that
they'd
certainly
be
glad
to
pay
$1.50
rather
than
to
hitchhike
in
the
polls.
besides
which
i
might
say
that
i
think
new
york
city
would
tax
even
walking
through
the
polls
that
it
found
a
way
to
tax
walking
and
collecting.
i
think
that
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
right
to
vote
is
as
fundamental
for
example
as
the
privilege
of
not
being
barred
from
getting
in
trial,
which
was
certainly
involved
in
1866
because
you
had
negroes
who
were
forbidden
to
engage
in
certain
occupations
and
some
of
the
black
coast.
or
to
have
a
home,
same
thing
as
it
was
fit
in,
in
some
of
the
black
coast.
or
for
example
the
black
code
laws
which
made
the
criminal
offense
punished
by
--
i
thinking
in
virginia
five
years
in
penitentiary
teaching
negroes
to
read
and
write.
to
prevent
again
--
enforcement,
prevent
slavery
votes.
and
i
might
say
personally
that
for
example
i
voted
--
i
take
personally
that
all
of
the
candidates
i
voted
for
in
the
last
general
action
lost,
i
don't
feel
personally
affected
at
all
although
of
course,
i'm
over
26.
i
also
say
as
far
as
this
particular
statute
is
concerned
that
i
don't
see
the
slightest
degree
of
difference
in
principle
between
congress
saying
that
puerto
ricans
educating
spanish
in
puerto
rico
may
vote
in
new
york
and
the
puerto
ricans
who
are
taught
to
drive
in
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road,
puerto
rico
may
drive
in
new
york
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road.
i
think
they're
exactly
the
same.
true
there's
an
argument
about
inconvenience.
i
think
there's
an
argument
about
inconvenience
that
goes
both
ways.
it's
inconvenient
to
print
materials
in
spanish.
it's
also
inconvenient
to
dodge
opposing
traffic
that
i
would
say
of
the
person
who'd
lived
in
manhattan,
and
i
think,
and
in
new
york,
it
was
resourceful
enough
to
find
a
parking
space
in
manhattan
as
resourceful
enough
to
be
able
to
dodge
in
opposing
traffic.
mr.
alfred
avins
i
agree
with
your
honor,
they
don't.
they
do
it
in
the
united
kingdom.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
one,
congress
has
the
power
under
the
territories
to
teach
or
to
permit
puerto
ricans
to
learn
how
to
drive
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road.
and
two,
under
the
very
argument,
that
the
under
territories
argument
would
then
have
the
power
to
let
the
--
say
that
puerto
ricans
come
in
to
new
york
may
drive
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road
because
what's
what
they've
learned
at
home.
so
i
think
it's
entirely
similar.
mr.
alfred
avins
well
i
don't
know
about
that
your
honor.
as
i
said
before,
i
--
having
driven
in
new
york
city,
i'm
not
sure
that
new
york
isn't
really
quite
resourceful
about
driving.
now,
i
might
say
that
in
my
estimation
if
this
court
has
the
power
to
set
standards
of
reasonableness,
it
means
that
in
fact
didn't
affect
this
court
with
this
setting
voting
qualifications,
likewise
if
congress
had
the
power
to
set
reasonableness,
it
just
shifts
the
power
from
one
to
the
other,
for
the
reason
that
in
my
view,
one
man
reasonableness
is
another
man's
(inaudible)
i
think
if
we
pull
every
person
in
this
room
as
to
what
would
be
reasonable
voting
qualifications
and
i
find
some
very
diverse
ideas
on
the
subject.
i
pass
it
and
left
up
to
me
alone.
i
might
be
able
to
limit
the
suffrage
to
--
only
to
people
are
two
doctrines
involved,
one
american
and
one
english,
and
then
i
could
unanimously
left
myself
press
it,
where
i
think
there
would
people
who
will
dissent
from
that
statute.
so
i
think
that
everybody
has
his
own
idea
of
what
is
reasonable.
though
i
think
in
conclusion
that
a
part
of
the
government's
structure
is
like
a
proper
automobile,
these
brakes
as
well
as
gas
pedal
and
i
think
that
the
original
function
of
this
court
was
to
break
the
popular
branches
of
the
government
and
not
to
serve
as
an
impetus
to
forward
movement.
and
i
think
though
it
maybe
a
lot
of
fun
to
drive
a
car
with
three
gas
pedals
and
no
break.
i
think
sooner
or
later,
we
go
off
to
the
constitutional
road
and
have
a
crack
out.
and
what
i'm
seriously
concerned
about,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
is
that
unless
original
understanding
is
followed,
original
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
and
i
don't
think
that
my
contention
about
the
original
understanding
has
been
refuted
in
the
least
by
either
of
the
three
of
my
learned
opponents.
that
the
result
would
be
ultimately,
the
result
would
be
ultimately
that
we'd
be
going
off
the
constitutional
road.
cannot
say
that
we
need
to
give
the
original
understanding
at
present
time
a
high
requiem
mask
but
i
think
perhaps
extreme
motion,
made
shortly
to
be
an
order
if
this
case
this
court
hold
that
congress
have
the
power
to
ignore
it,
the
very
clear
understanding
that
occurred
in
this
case.
and
if
your
honors
have
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
any
rebuttal
which
may
appear
to
be
necessary.
mr.
alfred
avins
oh
i
see
your
honor.
well,
in
that
case,
all
i
can
say
is
that
well
i
think
--
i
think
perhaps
that
i,
if
i
have
made
myself
clear
as
to
this
particular
point,
i
might
go
on
to
the
question,
one
question
which
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
casts
of
it
which
i
just
left
in
my
brief
but
perhaps
i'll
make
a
point
or
two
about
that.
and
that
is
the
discrimination
which
involved
in
this
statute
between
american
citizens
who
are
born
in
new
york
and
educated
in
a
foreign
language
outside
of
new
york
and
american
citizens
who
are
born
in/or
at
point
american
citizens
born
in
puerto
rico
or
educated
in
spanish
in
puerto
rico.
now,
to
me
it
seems
that
the
federal
statute
itself
is
irrational.
that
is
to
say
if
we
are
getting
into
a
rational
distinction
but
i'm
not
getting
into
a
discretion
where
the
new
york
distinction
is
rational
but
i
think
the
federal
distinction
is
irrational.
that
is
to
say
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
this.
it
is
entirely
possible
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
makes
all
persons
born
to
be
united
states
citizens,
the
moment
of
birth
for
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
abate
to
be
taken
to
a
non-american
flag
school
educated
with
foreign
language.
it's
not
only
you
can
see
but
i'm
sure
it
happens
in
a
number
of
cases
and
in
fact
i
may
say
that
i
have
a
second
cousin
whose
child
is
in
fact
being
educated
in
chile,
the
only
american
citizen
born
in
the
united
states.
so
therefore,
it
only
can
happen
but
has
happened
at
least
in
one
instance.
now
supposing
that
person
comes
back,
educating
chile,
able
to
read
and
write
spanish
just
as
well
as
any
puerto
rican
in
the
united
states
is
concerned.
comes
back
to
new
york,
offers
to
vote,
can
read
the
spanish
newspapers
just
as
well
as
any
new
york
any
person
educated
in
puerto
rico
can
read
the
spanish
language
in
his
papers.
what
happens,
sorry,
time
has
made
a
distinction.
is
this
a
distinction
that
has
any
rational
basis
to
it
at
all?
they're
both
american
citizens.
they're
both
now
citizens
of
new
york
because
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
all
persons
or
all
--
all
american
citizens
are
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
reside.
therefore
my
point
is,
that
being
citizens
of
the
state
which
they
reside
they
are
now
new
yorkers
and
there
is
absolutely
no
rational
distinction
to
say
a
new
yorker
educated
in
puerto
rico
shall
be
entitled
to
vote
and
a
new
yorker
educated
in
chile
shall
not,
though
i
know
--
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
i
think
it's
an
argument
against
the
appellant
in
that
case
and
i
think
it's
an
argument
against
the
appellant's
here.
my
contention,
perhaps
i
haven't
made
myself
clear
about
that
your
honor.
my
contention
is
this.
that
if
you
are
going
to
let
persons
literate,
not
english
language
in
new
york
vote,
you
got
to
let
them
all
vote.
why
let
only
that
people
vote
who
are
educated
in
american
flag
schools?
mr.
alfred
avins
well
i
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well
yes,
that
--
except
that
the
federal
statute.
you
see
that
this
is
--
my
--
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
irrational
to
let
know
it.
again,
i
apparently
haven't
made
myself
clear.
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
irrational,
not
to
make
a
distinction
between
people
who
speak
english
and
speak
--
people
who
speak
spanish.
to
let
my
--
to
let
the
child
of
my
cousin
vote
in
new
york,
to
not
let
the
child
who
can
vote
in
new
york
reading
only
know
in
spanish
would
be
perfectly
rational
providing
with
dividing
line
the
spanish-english.
mr.
alfred
avins
right.
right
and
the
reason
for
it
is
this.
now,
i
know
it
was
argued
for
long
that
a
person
educated
puerto
rico
learns
something
about
civics,
about
the
national
government
et
cetera.
but
certainly
learns
nothing
about
the
new
york
the
issues
in
the
new
york
city
municipal
election.
if
i
may
take
a
specific
case,
who
should
be
bar
--
president
to
the
bars?
this
is
not
a
question
that
that
--
does
this
one
learns
civics
in
puerto
rico,
what
the
local
issues
with
the
source
are
in
the
bars.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
but
you
see
of
course
that
--
that
is
the
question
of
a
reasonableness
of
the
distinction
between
--
in
terms
of
english
language.
the
person
coming
from
the
state
of
washington
assuming
he's
literate
with
the
english
language
would
be
able
to
read
all
of
this
material
about
what's
going
on
in
the
(inaudible).
my
contention
is
--
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
although
of
course
--
of
course
a
person
moving
to
washington
may
stay
in
new
york
for
20
years
and
keep
himself
totally
uninformed
of
what's
going
on.
that
is
--
the
residents
doesn't
guarantee
that
the
person
will
know
what's
going
on.
he
may
be
--
he
may
just
be
as
ignorant
of
local
affairs
as
anybody
in
the
world.
mr.
alfred
avins
he
doesn't
--
mr.
alfred
avins
no
it's
not.
there
are,
i
think
six
of
well
they
keep
--
the
number
of
newspapers
keeps
condensing
every
couple
of
years
i'm
trying
to
keep
up
with
it.
soon
there
will
be
a
monopoly
so
i
--
mr.
alfred
avins
there
are
some
spanish
newspapers,
your
honor.
of
course
they
are
not
in
kingston,
they
are
up
state
new
york
city.
what
about
the
spanish
language
voter
who
is
tries
to
vote
in
the
--
and
the
third
ward
nasni.
they're
no
--
there's
no
spanish
newspaper
there
or
radio
station
doesn't
cover
the
issues
in
the
third
ward
nasni.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes
there
are
in
english.
there
are
many
--
two
spanish
language,
voters
in
the
third
ward
nasni.
now
of
course
the
candidate
speaks
english.
it's
true.
why
has
the
--
i
might
--
let
me
get
into
this.
i
guess
i'm
sort
of
backing
into
this
issue
by
the
tail.
i
suppose
i
might
is
--
i
ought
to
get
into
this
in
one
way
or
another.
let
me
look
at
something
that
was
submitted
in
the
record
below.
the
department
of
justice
has
affidavits
from
candidates
in
spanish
districts,
predominantly
spanish.
he
has
a
kit.
he
has
an
affidavit
by
herman
badillo
who's
margined
it
through
this
based
on
votes
registered
in
all
probability
registered
on
this
particular
act
that
i
might
say,
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
badillo,
i
have
never
heard
of
a
man
who
thought
to
people
voting
him
didn't
understand
the
issues.
but
the
part
that
i'm
making
you
see
is
this.
true,
dominantly
spanish
areas,
there
will
be
spanish
theory.
but
one
of
the
cases
was
in
rochester.
what
about
rochester?
what
about
austin?
there
are
other
cities
besides
new
york
city
and
new
york
state
even
though
many
new
yorkers
don't
think
so.
what
about
all
these
other
localities.
a
person
speaking
only
spanish
is
free
to
move
there,
free
to
live
there,
and
under
the
statute
free
to
vote
there.
how
is
he
going
to
know
what's
going
on
in
the
fourth
ward
nasni
and
nobody's
going
to
print
this
in
spanish
to
each
two
voters
nor
can
he
get
a
translator,
the
translator
all
the
campaign
that
should
have
comes
out
two
days
before
the
election.
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
purely
impossible
to
tell
a
voter
in
the
fourth
ward
nasni
to
a
spanish
language
voters,
what
is
going
on
the
fourth
ward
nasni.
they're
all
in
this
little
upstate
new
york
cities.
all
have
run
municipal
elections,
not
to
mention
connecticut.
of
course
the
law
applies
to
connecticut.
there
were
spanish
language
voters
in
connecticut.
there
are
only
5000.
there
are
no
spanish
language
newspapers.
the
problem
is
that
all
of
the
potentials
have
been
concentrated
in
new
york
city
as
if
new
york
city
were
not
on
the
hub
of
the
universe
but
the
only
place
for
the
universe.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
and
it's
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
alfred
avins
i
don't
know
your
honor,
i'm
not
--
i
wasn't
--
i'm
not
familiar.
there
are
other
states
beside
and
puerto
ricans
live
in
other
states,
i
mean
they
live
at
puerto
rico.
live
in
other
states
beside
and
the
record
shows
here
that
some
of
them
are
residents
connecticut,
50,
60,
whatever
the
case
may
be.
and
of
course
if
this
court
upholds
the
statutes,
they
got
uphold
with
all
the
states.
your
honor
can't
say
the
statute's
constitutional
after
the
71st
election
district
of
new
york,
maybe
your
honor
can
but
i
can't
see
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
the
71st
election
district
of
new
york
and
unconstitutional
at
the
69th
election
district
or
the
42nd
or
the
12th
in
albany
and
it's
constitutional
as
to
one
that's
not
as
to
another
and
the
constitution
of
the
statute
depends
upon
the
circulation
in
how
much
the
issues
are,
how
much
is
discussed.
to
me,
it
would
be
judicial
chaos.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
there
is
telugu
and
tamil,
hindi
--
mr.
alfred
avins
into
the
local
--
into
the
local
language.
mr.
alfred
avins
that
is
--
yes.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
that
is
true
your
honors.
but
the
point
is
--
the
point
that
i'm
making
first
of
all,
of
course,
the
indian
languages
are
reached.
now
for
example,
tamil
is
spoken
in
madras
state.
you
find
every
few
people
speaking
gujarati
in
madras
state.
i'm
glad
your
honor
raised
the
question
in
india
because
i
expect
to
be
publishing
a
book
in
india,
labor
law
next
year.
gujarati,
there
are
cases
that
if
your
honors
if
i'll
file
as
supplemental
brief
your
honor
once,
pointing
out
cases
which
hold
that
it's
illegal
to
transfer
an
employee
from
bombay
to
madras
who
speaks
only
the
native
language,
it's
illegal
because
it
wouldn't
understand
what
was
going
on
that
--
on
in
madras.
mr.
alfred
avins
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
avins
do
you
mean
under
the
territories
clause
or
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
alfred
avins
oh
well,
your
honor
my
position
is
this.
under
the
territories
clause,
congress
is
just
a
super
legislature
of
puerto
rico.
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
--
into
what
i
concede
to
be
a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
learned
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
general
of
puerto
rico's
precise
distribution
of
power
between
congress
and
the
territory
of
puerto
rico.
but
assuming
that
it
was
just
a
territory
pure
and
simple
comes
nothing
but
a
super
legislature
for
puerto
rico.
mr.
alfred
avins
your
honor,
my
conception
of
the
territories
power
is
that
congress
is
absolute
and
plenary
to
power
to
legislate
for
the
territories.
therefore,
it
necessarily
follows
my
--
except
of
course
with
the
bill
of
rights
and
certain
other
general
limitations
could
possible
of
a
bill
of
attainder
of
course,
the
territories
any
more
than
other
place.
but
my
suggestion
to
your
honor
--
my
answer
to
your
honors
question
is
that
it
has
absolute
power
over
the
territories
subject
to
general
limitations
in
the
constitution
and
can
act
as
if
it
were
the
legislature
of
puerto
rico.
therefore
of
course,
it
could
abolish
any
action
by
the
puerto
rican
legislature
which
i
conceive
to
bear
the
same
relation
to
congress
as
a
city
council
of
new
york
bears
the
state
legislature
of
new
york.
the
puerto
rican
legislature
does
not
exercise
sovereignty,
any
kind
of
sovereignty.
it's
a
delegated
power
which
of
course
congress
can
always
revoke
by
passing
an
inconsistent
statute.
mr.
alfred
avins
my
answer
is
yes
but
for
very
special
reason
which
wouldn't
apply
the
other
way.
mr.
alfred
avins
not
--
no.
my
contention
is
absolutely
no
power
or
whatever.
i
go
even
further.
i
make
it
--
i'll
make
a
--
i'll
make
a
suggestion
which
i
think
is
probably
more
absurd
than
that
if
the
state
of
hawaii
decided
that
all
caucasians
were
flabby
lot
and
that
no
person
ought
to
be
entitled
to
vote
in
hawaii
unless
he
could
do
20
push-ups
and
apply
this
uniformly
to
everybody
that
hawaii
would
be
perfectly
some
constitutional
ground
however
much
i
think
--
i
think
is
going
to
absolutely
absurd
to
require.
that
is
i'm
talking
about
the
question
of
power.
mr.
alfred
avins
couldn't
do
a
thing
about
it,
of
course,
the
fifteenth
amendment
feels
(voice
overlap).
mr.
alfred
avins
or
the
nineteenth,
yes,
that
is
the
order
of
course.
that
is
those
special
amendments
which
have
directed
their
attention
to
this.
that
is
--
those
special
amendments
and
i
might
say
this
one
that
i
think
would
be
even
more
raw,
would
be
a
discrimination
based
on
religion.
and
yet,
the
provision
composed
fifteenth
amendment
to
ban
discriminations
based
on
religion
would
knock
that.
mr.
alfred
avins
yes,
as
long
as
i
think
it
--
mr.
alfred
avins
as
long
as
i
would
think
it
need
to
do
so.
mr.
alfred
avins
as
long
as
i
would
--
as
personally
wrong
as
i
would
think
--
mr.
alfred
avins
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
avins
i
quite
--
that
is
my
position
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
it's
a
question
simply
of
power.
that
is
my
--
if
i
may
make
--
that
is
the
--
congress
cannot
chop
up
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
make
a
toss
green
salad
out
of
it
because
it
doesn't
like
the
original
recipe.
if
it
doesn't
like
the
original
recipe,
it's
got
to
get
a
new
recipe.
the
way
you
get
a
new
recipe
is
article
5.
you
amend
the
constitution.
there
have
been
amendments
proposed
and
some
enacted
a
number
probably
more
in
recent
years
than
any
other
time.
and
there
may
be
amendments
that
i
would
be
much
in
favor
of
but
i
would
be
much
against
that
congress
exercising
a
power
in
unconstitutional
manner
which
it
might
be
very
desirable
to
exercise
in
a
constitutional
manner.
it's
a
question
it
seems
to
me
of
legality.
mr.
alfred
avins
accepting
respectfully
the
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well
it
--
no
your
honor.
my
position
is
this.
it's
the
question
of
original
understanding,
you
see.
mr.
alfred
avins
i
think
the
case
is
--
mr.
alfred
avins
well,
if
the
congress
of
bingham
served
that
the
original
understanding
of
the
due
process
clause.
they
just
asked
the
question
by
congressman
rogers,
andrew
jackson
rogers
was
the
young
democrat
from
new
jersey,
considered
as
a
white
young
democrat.
and
he
replied
that
the
gentleman
can
go
and
read
the
decisions
that's
been
cited
by
the
court
and
he
can
read
decisions.
therefore,
i
would
do
exactly
what
he
--
congressman
bingham
suggests.
i
will
read
all
the
decisions
on
due
process
before
the
civil
war.
mr.
alfred
avins
well
my
arg
--
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
it
wouldn't
because
the
original
understanding
of
course
in
respect
to
voting
is
of
entirely
outside
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question,
you
mean
the
legislation
or
the
right
to
vote?
i
thought
your
honor
was
talking
about
the
right
to
vote.
as
to
the
right
to
vote
it's
not
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
in
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
particular
item
of
legislation
violates
due
process,
the
concepts,
the
general
basic
concepts
in
my
contention
is
one
goes
back
to
the
pre-civil
war
cases,
distills
the
general
basic
concepts
of
due
process
before
at
that
time.
they
are
carried
into
the
due
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
by
bingham's
intent
which
i
consider
to
be
very
clear
from
his
statement
made
in
the
39th
congress.
and
then
that
is
the
content
of
the
due
process
clause,
the
general
principles
of
course.
now,
what
they
are
for
example,
i
think
that
was
in
the
new
york
case
in
1856,
we
supported
the
proposition
if
there
was
a
concept
to
substantive
due
process.
in
fact
there
have
been
numerable
cases
on
due
process.
i
have
an
article
on
--
mr.
alfred
avins
pardon.
mr.
alfred
avins
no,
it
wouldn't
because
it's
very
clear
--
mr.
alfred
avins
or
equal
protection,
yes
that
is
my
contention.
i
might
say
that
of
course
due
process
applies
to
all
persons
which
is
another
good
reason.
bingham
the
said
against
letting
aliens
vote
and
nothing
that
he
did
say,
in
fact,
in
the
admission
of
oregon,
one
of
those
two
reasons
for
voting
against
the
admission
of
oregon,
he
made
a
long
speech
on
the
subject
where
he
said,
this
is
a
recent
new
innovation
which
he
was
dead
set
against
was
contrary
to
the
constitution
and
aliens
were
permitted
to
vote
in
oregon.
he
said
it's
a
recent
innovation
which
maintained
illinois
and
one
or
two
of
the
western
states
to
induce
him
against
the
commerce
to
permit
aliens
to
vote.
he
said
he
was
dead
set
against
it
and
therefore
it's
inconceivable
that
he
attended
to
permit
aliens
to
vote,
contrary
to
his
own
long
well-settled
convictions.
and
therefore
since
the
due
process
clause
protects
aliens
as
well
as
citizens,
it
--
to
me
it's
inconceivable
that
the
due
process
clause
would
protect
the
right
to
vote
for
the
reason
that
otherwise
the
aliens
would
be
entitled
a
right
to
vote.
because
of
course,
as
far
as
protection
of
life,
liberty,
and
property,
you
couldn't
take
that
without
due
process
from
aliens
anyway.
i
think
every
alien
would
be
entitled
if
he
came
to
this
country.
he
would
be
entitled
to
not
have
life,
liberty,
or
property
taking
to
confront
him
without
due
process
of
law.
so
you
see
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
fact
it
brought
back
to
its
historical
understanding
and
fits
very
neatly.
that
is
it
--
it's
--
makes
sense.
you
don't
need
to
try
and
figure
out
some
of
these
odd
--
oddities.
what
would
have
you?
give
everybody
the
protection
as
a
person
99
years
old
entitled
to
go
to
a
first
grade
school,
so
that
you'd
got
to
have
reasonable
classification.
you
have
to
have
all
sorts
of
qualifications.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
original
understanding,
i
think
you
do
not
need
to
have
any
qualifications.
now,
i
know
you
--
i
think
i
have
a
bit
more
time
and
i
just
want
to
say
a
word
since
your
honor
originally
asked
me
and
i
thought
--
i
thought
having
this
obvious
but
as
i
have
a
few
minutes
say
one
or
two
words,
just
about
the
question
of
treaty.
i
do
not
consider
that
congress'
power
under
the
treaty
clause
and
i
think
this
is
well
settled,
to
add
to
any
substantive
power
congress
has
in
the
constitution.
now,
i
think
i
have
set
forth
as
earliest
decisions
in
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
that
--
and
i
think
perhaps
it's
worth
reading
the
little
snibb
--
squib
from
carter
and
grant
that
the
--
i'm
sorry,
pollard
and
hagan
in
3
howard.
now,
the
king
of
spain
--
it
can't
be
admitted
to
the
king
of
spain
could
by
treaty
or
otherwise
impart
of
the
united
states
any
of
his
royal
prerogatives.
much
less
cannot
be
admitted
they
have
the
capacity
to
receive
the
power
to
exercise
them.
every
nation
acquiring
territory
by
treaty
or
otherwise
withholds
its
subject
to
the
constitution
and
laws
of
its
own
government
and
not
according
to
those
that
the
government's
ceding.
therefore,
the
treaty
with
spain
treaty
of
paris
gives
the
united
states
no
power
over
the
territories
and
wouldn't
have
otherwise.
my
contention
is
it
would
have
the
same
power
by
statutes.
and
therefore,
i
say,
that
the
statute
gains
no
additional
efficacy
by
the
united
nations
charter
or
by
world
rule
of
law
conventions
or
by
treaties
or
by
statements
by
the
un
secretary
general
or
resolutions
or
anything.
it's
either
constitutional
within
congress'
power
or
it's
not.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
is
clear
cut.
the
statute
invades
or
reserve
power
of
the
states.
thank
you
your
honor,
that's
all
i
have
to
say.
