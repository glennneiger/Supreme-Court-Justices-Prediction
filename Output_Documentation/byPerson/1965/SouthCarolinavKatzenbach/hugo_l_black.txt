justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
statute
use
the
word
presumption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
is
that
a
presumption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
on
these
papers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
original
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
pages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
the
same
rule
with
reference
to
presumption
and
burden
of
proof
which
you're
talking
about
that's
applied
in
criminal
cases
necessarily
apply
to
congress
in
passing
along?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
good?
you
say
it's
taken
away
her
right,
that's
one
of
the
question
here,
isn't
it?
if
that
right,
if
that
practice
turns
in
the
way
of
following
out
the
subdivision
two
of
the
amendment,
how
could
you
say
that
that's
necessarily
right
for
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
congress
reaches
a
conclusion
that
just
meant
to
say
they
do
that
in
order
to
enforce
it,
their
right,
their
privilege
to
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
have
done
it,
couldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
direct
on
the
statements
you
made
with
the
kind
of
burden.
i
didn't
intend
to
leave
the
impression
that
i
thought
those
were
bad.
what
i
said
was
that
congress
had
a
right
to
conclude
that
they
would
stand
in
the
way
of
the
right
to
vote
so
that
it
would
have
power
under
part
two
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
legislate
against
them,
which
is
quite
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
know,
you
don't
need
to
do
that,
i
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to
ask
you
just
one
more
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you're
right
that
this
law
should
be
applied
generally
throughout
the
country
on
a
uniform
basis
as
a
provision
at
the
end
of
the
act
which
says
that
anyone
part
of
the
act
is
held
bad,
anyone
part
of
the
act
is
held
bad
that
that
shall
not
affect
the
other
parts
of
the
act.
suppose
it
were
held,
suppose
one
would
agree
with
you
that
it
should
be
applied
all
over
the
country?
why
would
that
necessary
to
be
a
part
of
this
act?
why
couldn't
the
act
stand
without
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
attorney
general
carry
out
his
plan
against
any
state
he
would
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
the
same
principle
at
which
you
apply
or
prefer
to
apply
to
the
state
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
makes
it
a
crime
to
gamble
--
have
gambling
in
one
county
only,
picks
it
up,
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
we've
had
that
case
out
of
(voice
overlap)
related
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
provision
did
you
say
it's
clear
that
a
law
passed
by
the
federal
government
must
apply
a
light
in
all
the
state,
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice

that's
specifically
what
has
been
made

black
--
do
you
think?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
amendment's
powers?
justice

where
can
you
find
this
in

the

i'm
talking
about
if

but
there
was
evidence
of
that
characteristic
to
other
states.
justice
hugo

black
what
was
the
case
to
which
you
referred
cummings,
what?
justice

black
in
what?
justice

black
what
bridge
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
it's
rather
important
to
me.
am
i
to
understand
that
you're
implicitly
assuming
or
conceding
that
congress
would
not
have
the
power
to
permanently
outlaw
these
practices?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
state
could
they
not
possibly
be
used.
i
don't
quite
--
i
don't
think
that
has
to
be
decided
here
but
that's
rather
a
broad
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
we
had
a
case
a
few
days
ago
from
one
of
the
northern
states
on
that
very
subject
and
still
have
attended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
a
literacy
test
in
new
york
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
recent
case
on
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mdoes
that
section
2
have
any
effect
on
this
bill
except
the
statement
of
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
no
sanctions
can
be
applied
under
it,
are
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
provision
in
the
act
which
makes
an
offense
or
attempts
to
make
it
an
offense
but
first
in
administering
the
law
that
apply
one
of
these
what
you
call
devices
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
totally
on
account
in
order
to
discriminate
on
account
of
felony.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
not
apply
to
an
election
officer
who
deliberately
applies,
used
the
test
to
discriminate
on
the
account
of
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
that
be
an
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he
was
using
it
to
deprive
him
of
his
vote
on
account
of
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
pretty
effective
section
itself
is
it
not?
it
can
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
understand
the
difference,
yes.
i
was
just
asking
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
since
we're
considering
a
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understood
you,
there's
been
no
objection
raised
in
the
section
except
4
and
5.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
noticed
that
they
weren't
challenged
by
south
carolina
but
if
they
are
challenged
by
south
carolina,
is
it
your
idea
that
we
would
not
be
called
on
to
pass
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
depending
on
the
fact
that
the
first
clause
was
adopted
in
1788
that
is
a
general
clause
relating
to
the
right
to
voting
in
the
state
[inaudible]
it's
a
specific
expressed
provision
designed
to
enter
--
to
cut
off
anything
that
didn't
appeared
with
it
in
the
past.
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
so-called
triggers
affected
automatic,
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
just
used
some
words
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
use
some
words
to
say
that
if
this
petition
exist,
it's
not
difficult
to
find
out,
that's
the
condition
upon
which
this
act
will
go
into
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
would
cover
certain
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
after
all
the
intents
and
purposes
was
to
cover
a
certain
state.
if
that's
the
case,
what
difference
does
it
make
about
rationality
if
this
is
a
--
congress
had
a
right
to
pass
the
law.
it
also
has
the
right
to
condition
it
for
an
automatic
term
such
as
for
the
next
six
months,
12
months
on
certain
census,
certain
population,
and
so
forth.
that
being
the
case
then,
why
isn't
the
fact
that
it
permits
some
states
thereafter
to
relieve
themselves
from
it
and
that
act
of
grace
on
the
part
of
congress
which
it
does
not
require
any
judicial
review
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
still
it
gets
--
that
still
leaves
you
with
one
proposition
which
i
think
probably
you've
finished
or
i'm
not
sure.
assuming
all
of
these,
getting
over
these
so-called
procedure
hurdle
i
rather
call
them,
assuming
that
you
have
a
situation
where
no
provision
of
the
constitution
gave
general
power
to
the
states
to
govern
election
and
it
could
take
its
literacy
test.
now
you
have
a
new
provision,
you
take
a
new
look
at
the
constitution
and
they
say
we'll
had
covered
it
here
with
the
state.
we
want
to
correct
it.
the
main
trouble
has
been
their
reference
for
depriving
people
their
vote
on
account
of
color
and
we're
going
to
amend
that
so
as
to
say
that
there
could
be
no
law
of
that
kind
and
we're
going
to
go
further
to
say
that
that
is
barred
by
the
constitution.
we're
going
to
give
congress
in
addition
to
its
necessary
and
proper
power
another
buttressing
to
make
it
still
counter
that
they
have
the
right
to
pass
such
legislation
as
is
necessary
or
appropriate
to
us
in
no
difference
between
the
words,
much
in
order
to
do
this,
you
still
have
to
meet
the
problem
of
whether
they
have
the
power
for
it
--
i
can
see
no
distinction
myself
between
temporary
and
permanent.
if
they
don't
have
it
permanently,
i
don't
see
why
they
have
it
temporary.
then
you've
got
to
see
whether
or
not
they
have
the
power
to
do
away
with
this
test
if
congress
reaches
the
conclusion
that
it's
necessary
to
do
it
in
order
to
protect
the
voters
right
from
discrimination
on
the
account
of
color
and
of
course
congress
doesn't
have
to
have
evidence
of
what's
been
done,
it's
a
matter
of
the
history
of
the
nation
which
had
been
denied
here,
politically
known
to
everybody
in
the
country
that
those
tests
have
been
used
for
that
purpose
as
established
in
all
the
cases.
but
you
--
what
is
--
what
is
your
answer
to
the
argument
that
that
is
the
way
the
congress
has
the
full
power
to
obliterate
the
test
temporarily
or
permanently
if
it
sees
that
it
reaches
the
conclusion
that
that's
the
way
to
protect
their
right.
why
don't
they
have
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
consider
that
myself
to
be
their
business
and
not
mine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
that's
the
difference
in
the
courts.
from
my
standpoint,
that's
the
business
of
congress
and
not
split
it
up
into
parts
to
say
that
for
us
to
split
it
up
and
say
it'd
be
reasonable
to
go
this
far
but
not
reasonable
to
go
this
far
in
particular
direction.
i
think
that's
their
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
in
your
judgment
have
to
decide
that
question
about
5
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
other
question
on
this.
suppose
that
they
--
suppose
that's
held
invalid,
why
would
that
invalidate
the
other
section
of
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
someone
else
could
see
it
differently
and
they
did
hold
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
that
would
invalidate
section
4
in
the
other
provisions
of
the
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
defending
section
5
too,
constitutionality
of
section
5?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
cong
--
suppose
congress
passed
a
law,
advising
new
jersey
to
submit
to
the
district
of
columbia
courts,
all
constitutional
amendments
before
they
became
adapted.
what
provision
of
the
federal
constitution
would
you
think
authorizes
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
when
the
federal
constitution
was
adopted
an
effort
was
made
to
let
courts
pass
on
the
constitutionality
and
the
wisdom
of
acts
before
they
were
passed
for
the
constitution
of
the
various
laws.
why
would
you
look
to
find
the
authority
in
the
constitution
to
require
a
state
submit
its
constitution
for
consideration
by
united
states
district
court
and
district
of
columbia
before
it
could
go
into
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
that's
right.
suppose
they
did
that
to
new
jersey.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
defending
that
phase
of
section
5
of
this
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
constitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
a
judicial
function
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
constitution
before
it
finally
becomes
effective?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
a
judicial
act
or
is
that
--
what
kind
of
an
act
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress
has
to
pass
a
law
provided
that
they're
after
constitution
amendments
for
the
federal
constitution
should
be
submitted
to
this
court
in
advance
to
pass
on
them.
