mr.
attorney
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
it's
a
privilege
to
be
here
--
here
and
what
i
conceived
that
these
rights
side
of
litigation
over
an
act
which
will
deeply
affect
the
fundamental
rights
of
the
government,
the
state,
the
individual
level
and
which
if
allowed
to
stand
is
the
ultimate
destruction
of
our
constitution
and
to
our
dear
government.
i
also
like
to
show
the
sanctions
of
our
brief
under
the
supreme
court
rules
to
this
court
define
for
argument.
isaac
walton
once
said
that
doubtless
god
could
make
a
better
berry,
and
a
strawberry,
doubtless
god
had
not.
today,
i
can
say
that
doubtless,
congress
could
enact
worse
legislation
in
the
voting
rights
act
but
doubtless
congress
had
never
enacted
anything
more
flagrantly
on
the
constitution.
our
argument
relates
to
the
denial
of
free
access
to
the
court,
the
invasion
and
denial
of
equality
of
people
and
unlawful
delegation
of
power.

(b)
of
the

restrict
suits
for

judgments
and
injunctions
against
the
execution
or
enforcement
of
the

to

under
section
5
of
the
act,
no
legislative
changes
before
the

of

in
an
affected
state
maybe
effective
until
permitted
by

of
the
district

of
the
district
of

in
effect,
the
states,
individual
voters,
the
rights
or
debates
are
diluted;
election
officials
and
others
are
denied
free
and
reasonable
access
to
the
court.
free
access
is
obviously
denied
and
that
all
litigation
must
proceed
to
one
judicial
courtroom,
just
to
elaborate
tort
condition
to
rest
doesn't
mean
it's
an
ingress
or

in
our
case,
the
congressionally
conditioned
states
have
got
a
one
shot
access
to
enjoin
improper
enforcement
of
the
act
or
to
obtain
declaration
of
the
unconstitutional
applications
of
the
act.
although
the

this

unconstitutional
deprivation
of

to
the
court.
there
are
many
individuals,
particularly
states,
election
individuals
who
are
personally
vitally
concerned
with
the
current
meaning,
application
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
these
many
aspects,
yet
for
instance
in
alabama,
you
may
need
to
travel
800
miles
or
more,
choctaw
county
for
the
district
of
columbia,
as
has
been
said,
without
the
power,
to
subpoena
witnesses
for
more
than
100
miles.
it's
even
to
elaborate
upon
the
expense
of
the
burden,
and
practically
impossibility
of
obtaining
free
prompt
or
effects
of
justice
under
said
conditions.
this
is
drastic
and
despotic
legislation.
it
gives
no
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard
to
prevent
and/or
to
present
evidence
and
it's
not
in
the
clause
with
both
“fundamental
principles
of
liberty
and
justice”
that
mr.
justice
black
has
said
“lies
at
the
base
of
our
civil
and
political
institution”.
if
the
congress
can
validly
designate
one
article
iii
federal
courts
to
handle
the
litigation
to
this
act
or
any
other
act,
it
can
designate
any
article
iii
federal
court
with
the
invalidity
of
the
act
has
been
more
or
less
apparent.
if
congress
had
designated
the
district
court
--
a
district
court
in
the
state
of
hawaii
instead
of
the
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
effective
--
the
effect
of
the
restrictive
provisions
is
to
say
among
other
things
that
a
state
statute
cannot
become
effective
until
approved
by
federal
court
with
a
specifically
named
federal
court.
thus,
such
court
has
made
a
part
of
the
state's
law
making
power.
this
is
certainly
not
within
the
grant
of
any
provision
of
the
constitution.
we
are
familiar
with
the
legislative
contention
made
by
the
defendant
and
this
relies
on
the
cases
relative
to
emergency
price
control
legislation
in
world
war
ii,
the
rationale
of
those
cases
are
based
on
a
great
factual
jeopardy
and
as
much
as
the
earlier
legislation
was
admittedly
of
a
temporary
nature
to
meet
war
time
crisis,
while
the
voting
rights
act
is
permanent
and
no
nationwide
voting
crisis
exists.
we
--
this
contention
put
--
in
this
contention,
i
think
that
the
words
of
mr.
justice
rutledge,
the
court
will
bear
with
me
in
the
case
of
yakus
versus
united
states.
there's
forceful
or
forceful
and
most
applicable
to
the
first
case
in
view
of
the
absolute
prohibition
against
any
court
to
say
that
of
the
district
of
columbia
going
into
the
validity
of
the
various
unconstitutional
provisions
of
the
act
so
far
as
the
states
and
the
citizens
of
a
state
and
the
state
election
official
is
concerned.
he
said,
“nor
has
it
been
held
that
congress
can
forbid
a
court
vested
with
a
judicial
power
under
article
iii
to
consider
this
question
and
called
upon
to
give
effect
to
a
statutory
or
the
mandate.
it
is
one
thing
for
congress
to
withhold
jurisdiction,
it
is
entirely
another
to
confer
it
and
direct
that
it
be
exercised
in
a
manner,
inconsistent
with
constitutional
requirements
or
what
in
some
instances
may
be
the
same
thing
without
regard
to
that.
once
it
is
held
that
congress
can
require
the
courts
criminally
to
enforce
the
unconstitutional
law
of
the
statutes
including
regulations
or
to
do
so
without
regard
to
their
validity,
their
way
will
have
been
found
to
circumvent
the
supreme
law
and
what
is
more,
to
make
the
court's
parties
in
doing
so.
whenever
the
judicial
power
is
called
into
authority,
it
is
responsible
directly
to
the
fundamental
law
and
no
other
authority
can
intervene,
force
or
authorize
the
judicial
body
to
disregard
it.”
that's
88
law,
edition
834
united
states
versus
yakus.
in
the
time
of
magna
carta,
we
believe
that
has
been
a
judicially
accepted
principle
in
the
english
speaking
world
that
every
litigant
ought
to
be
able
to
obtain
justice
completely,
properly
and
without
being
obliged
to
purchase
it
as
recently
affirmed
by
this
court
in
gideon
versus
wainwright,
of
course
that's
an
impossibility
when
you
have
to
travel
this
many
hundreds
or
thousands
of
miles.
and
because
of
that
already,
the
suit
has
been
denied
access
to
the
courts
under
this
act.
for
example
the
registrars
of
montgomery
county,
alabama
to
say
nothing
of
similar
results
and
in
other
cases
and
in
other
base
where
the
courts
have
said,
because
of

(b)
we
can't
touch
your
contention.
yet
of
course,
the
government
has
the
opportunity
to
proceed
in
any
court.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
congress
cannot
fall
or
restrict
the
power
of
the
judiciary
to
determine,
interpret
and
apply
the
law
through
the
guise
of
merely
restricting
venue.
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
and
the
inevitable
lack
of
due
process
resulting
from
such
onerous
restriction
we
think
forbid.
now,
with
respect
to
the
equality
of
statehood
which
have
been
touched
upon
by
various
attorneys
preceding
me
and
by
some
members
of
the
court,
i
think
article
iv
section
3
has
involved
the
present
situation,
not
historically
repetitive
of
the
legal
constitutional
turmoil
in
the
united
states
as
1850's
and
1860's
were
highly
analogous.
that
time,
those
were
administered
to
federal
government,
prompted
by
the
parties
and
spirit
in
prejudice
had
become
so
strong,
they
were
no
longer
willing
to
be
bound
by
the
ligaments
of
our
written
constitution.
and
coyle
versus
smith,
this
court
asked
the
question,
“can
a
state
be
placed
upon
the
claim
of
equal
--
inequality
with
its
sister
states
in
the
union
if
the
congress
chooses
to
impose
conditions
which
so
operate
at
the
time
of
its
admission?”
the
court
answered
its
own
question
by
saying,
“although
that
is
illinois
admission,
he
at
once
became
entitled
to
and
possessed
all
the
rights
of
dominion
and
sovereignty
which
belonged
to
their
original
states.
she
was
admitted
and
could
be
admitted
only
on
the
same
footing
with
it.
equality
of
constitutional
rights
and
power
is
the
condition
of
all
the
states
of
the
union.”
if
it
was
unconstitutional
to
deprive
a
state
of
a
sovereign
power
on
an
attribute
of
equality
as
a
condition
or
restriction
and
the
conditional
act
of
admission,
then
a
fortiori
that
such
a
deprivation
by
congress
cannot
be
sanctioned
or
upheld
to
legislation
fast
long
subsequent
through
the
state's
admission.
the
act
which
admitted
louisiana
for
instance
provides
he
be
admitted
“on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
in
all
respects
whatever”.
it
is
not
the
mere
assertion
of
her
equality
in
this
clause
which
is
that
is
her
equality.
it
only
pronounces
that
equality
which
the
constitution
establishes.
if
she'd
be
equal,
however,
she
must
be
equally
exempt
from
the
legislation
of
congress
past
or
future
as
are
elder
states.
that's
permoli
versus
new
orleans,
3
howard,
589.
the
congressional
clause
inserted
in
the
acts
of
admission
relating
to
perpetual
freedom
of
navigable
waters
as
common
highways
was
never
held
to
restrain
to
--
in
any
degrees
of
full
power
of
the
state
even
if
the
exercise
of
state
power
resulted
in
obstructions
and
impediments
to
navigation,
that's
in

“the
right
of
alabama
and
every
other
new
states
to
exercise
all
the
powers
of

which
belong
to
and
may
be
exercised
by
the
original
states
of
the
union
must
be
admitted
and
remained
unquestioned
except
so
far
as
they
have
temporarily
deprived
the
control
over
the
public
lands,
from
pollard
versus
hagan,
44
u.s.
212
and
this
court
further
emphasized
that
proposition
in
the
and
escanaba
versus
city
of
chicago
when
it
held
equality
of
constitutional
right
and
power
is
the
conviction
of
all
the
states
of
the
union
old
and
new.
the
equal
footing
clause
prevents
extension
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
and
to
a
domain
of
political
and
sovereign
power
of
the
united
states
from
which
the
other
states
have
been
excluded.
just
as
it
prevents
a
contraction
of
sovereign,
that
is
state
sovereignty
which
would
produce
inequality
among
the
states.
for
equality
of
states
means
that
they
are
not
less
or
greater
or
differed
in
dignity
or
power,
that
in
u.s.
versus
texas,
339
u.s.707.
the
freedom
of
speech,
press,
religion,
assembly,
association,
and
petition
are
protected
as
immune
from
state
invasion
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
i
believe
that
perhaps
so
in
gideon
versus
wainwright.
so
conversely,
a
preexisting
and
fundamental
attribute
of
sovereignty
of
the
states
that
is
the
regulation
of
the
elective
franchise
is
immune
from
federal
invasion
transaction,
diminution
or
destruction
by
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendment
as
well
as
by
the
doctrine
of
equality
of
statehood.
the
negative
constitutional
proscription
against
state
denial
or
abridgement
of
the
right
to
vote
by
reason
of
race
or
color
partly
creates
an
affirmative
federal
power
to
setup
a
system
of
federal
elected
franchise
with
any
state
interrogation,
if
not
destruction
of
an
electoral
procedure,
not
discriminatory
upon
its
face.
and
thereby,
deprive
such
state
of
its
constitutional
equality
of
political
sovereignty.
as
i
recall
only
by
the
reconstruction
act
which
i
think
in
one
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
was
declared
unconstitutional,
has
congress
ever
free
this,
they
attempted
to
setup
an
elective
franchise.
it
is
interesting
to
compare,
therefore
the
voting
qualifications
in
that
act
to
those
of
this
act.
as
a
former,
it
seems
have
served
as
a
suggestive
model
for
this
act.
the
qualifications
of
the
reconstruction
acts
are
that
the
voter
would
be
21
years
of
age
and
upwards
that
he'd
be
a
resident
of
the
state
for
one
year
previous
to
the
elections
and
it
excludes
those
who
participated
in
the
rebellion
or
who
committed
felonies
at
common
law.
we
view
--
i'll
mention
later
as
to
how
that
is
being
applied
in
the
present
day
and
under
the
present
act.
we
find
that
in
the
application
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
alabama
that
is
practically
the
rules,
the
qualifications,
the
criteria
that's
being
followed
today.
congress,
as
we
must
remember
has
assumed
the
protection
of
voters
and
their
right
of
franchise
vis-à-vis
state
laws
that
is
under
the
fifteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
and
has
assumed
the
protection
of
the
application
of
these
law
as
this
court
had
properly
held
congress
may
do.
it
has
done
so
in
many
ways
and
more
recently
through
enactment
of
the
various
civil
rights
act
and
supplementary
legislation.
and
in
respect
thereof,
it
has
been
frequently
held
that
this
court,
the
government
is
not
included
from
evading
and
correcting
any
impediments
or
discriminations
by
anything,
the
states
or
individuals,
by
state
authority
to
do
in
violation
of
the
congressionally
enacted
prohibitions.
the
voting
rights
act
at
its
very
time
goes
far
beyond
the
protective
regulations
of
the
civil
rights
acts
by
actually
asserting
its
power
to
outlaw
and
suspend
and
i
say
destroy
because
the
power
to
suspend
is
the
power
to
destroy.
if
you
can
suspend
for
five
years,
you
may
be
able
to
suspend
for
25
years.
that
is
by
actually
asserting
a
power
to
outlaw
and
destroy
an
existing
elected
franchise
and
to
create
and
install
in
lieu
thereof
federal
criteria
qualifications
and
procedures
for
voting
even
in
local
and
state
election,
never
before
the
judgment
in
that
court,
the
facts
and
substance
this
act
does
and
this
without
making
it
uniformly
applicable
to
all
the
states.
uniformity,
however,
could
only
cure
this
one
defect
of
constitution
--
of
unconstitutionality
or
defect
of
constitutional
inequality
of
statehood
and
would
by
no
means
cure
what
i
call
a
vindictive
act
of
its
many
other
constitutional
defects.
the
destruction
of
equality,
sovereignty
of
seven
entire
states,
we
submit,
is
a
far
more
calamitous
political
crime
than
is
their
alleged
passed
discriminatory
depravation
of
individual
political
rights
in
a
few
counties
of
a
few
of
the
50
states.
other
states
remain
free
to
regulate
fair
franchise
to
have
that
pass
or
to
enact
new
laws
without
the
crippling
conditions
imposed
by
the
voting
rights
act
upon
alabama
and
the
other
affected
states.
alabama
has
recently
enacted
legislation
through
a
constitutional
amendment
and
through
an
enabling
act
that
changes
the
voter
qualification
acts
that
puts
it
very
nearly
on
a
footing
to
that
of
new
york.
i
think
part
of
the
legislation
was
adopted
to
that
but
it
passed
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
voting
rights
act,
therefore,
it's
fraud,
we
can't
apply
regardless
of
power
or
good
it
might
be
or
how
effective
it
may
be
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the
conditions
that
congress
is
attempting
to
do.
as
pointed
out,
i
believe
in
wall
street
journal
commenting
on
this
act.
it
talks
about
this
inequality
of
statehood
proposition.
it
says
this
would
create
a
truly
ingenious
paradox.
the
illiterate
citizen,
negro
or
otherwise,
would
find
himself
with
more
rights
in
alabama
and
her
five
outcast
sister
states
than
the
great
state
of
new
york,
more
of
the
educational
level
of
the
voting
citizens
of
alabama,
the
low
level
of
which
is
part
of
the
general
complaint
against
it
by
civil
rights
leaders
would
be
further
reduced
and
this
by
federal
sanction.
unfortunately,
the
irony
is
not
funny.
they
need
to
paradoxilize
a
serious
question.
is
it
moral
that
our
national
law
should
apply
one
rule
to
one
state
and
another
to
another?
that
of
course
is
the
fundamental
proposition
in
violation
of
the
equality
of
statehood.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
my
portion
of
the
act
of
the
argument,
it
becomes
an
unlawful
delegation
of
power.
section
5
of
the
act
attempts
to
confer
non-judicial
powers
on
the
federal
courts.
that
is
the
proposition
which
would
be
argued
by
the
attorney
general
of
georgia.
section
6,
refers
to
judicial
powers
on
the
executive
department,
that
is
the
attorney
general.
when
section
6
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
appoint
federal
voting
examiners,
it
authorizes
him
to
take
action
which
suspend
and
supersedes
the
state's
voter
and
registration
system.
it's
a
punitive
proposition.
and
section
8
authorizes
intrusion
by
these
examiners
upon
and
in
appearance
with
purely
state
and
local
elections
and
procedure.
all,
after
he,
the
attorney
general
decides
that
because
in
his
judgment
or
as
things
appear
to
him
and
i'm
using
the
language
of
the
act
now,
more
or
less
people
of
one
ethnic
group
were
registered
to
vote
than
another,
there
was
in
fact
some
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
then,
when
he
exercises
that
judgment
or
things
appear
to
him
in
a
certain
way,
we
say,
that
using
that
power
which
was
delegated
if
that
is
actually
a
delegation
of
judicial
power
to
the
executive
department.
the
act
says
is,
“judgment”
is
the
key
to
its
remedially
corrective
or
punitive
action.
the
attorney
general's
judgment
in
turn
and
based
on
his
belief.
we
know
the
judgment
of
any
court
was
based
on
its
belief
of
the
facts
involved.
consequently,
congress
has
attempted
a
constitutionally
impossible
test
through
the
statutory
delegation
and
is
the
test
of
avoiding
the
fundamental
separation
of
judicial
and
executive
power.
it
has
unlawfully
conferred
judicial
power
upon
the
executive
and
made
the
attorney
general
and
both
the
judge
in
execution
in
respect
of
if,
when
and
how
there
should
be
federal
suspension
and
replacement
of
a
state
registration
process
by
a
federal
system,
not
by
in
an
effort
by
something
created
by
congress,
a
federal
system.
as
justice
sullivan
stated
in
springer
versus
philippine
islands,
277
u.s.
189,
“it
is
an
inherent
general
rule
in
the
american
constitutional
system
that
both
the
legislature
cannot
exercise
either
executive
or
judicial
power”.
the
legislative
treatment
under
question
is
a
double-barrel
attack
against
the
constitutional
separation
of
powers.
first,
it
assume
that
congress
has
the
judicial
power
of
deciding
when
on
or
what
circumstances
federal
voting
examiners
and
all
their
panoply
of
power
may
be
pirated
in
these
capital
states
where
local
election
laws
are
superseded.
and
then
second,
it
delegates
such
judicial
power
to
the
executive.
that
the
legislature
had
no
judicial
power
which
it
can
delegate,
it
cannot
give
such
power
to
an
executive
officer
to
determine
controversies
as
to
voting
rights
and
then
render
a
decision
to
determine
controversies
as
to
voting
rights.
and
render
a
decision
which
is
binding
on
the
state.
however,
that
is
exactly
the
situation
brought
about
by
this
act.
and
except
that
congress
has
gone
even
further
and
said
that
no
one
can
even
dispute
or
review
what
the
attorney
general
determines
and
decide.
it
gives
him
judicial
power
and
then
says
no
one
can
review
it.
we
realized
argument
may
be
made.
the
attorney
general
has
merely
given
the
power
to
supersede
and
eradicate
the
state's
registration
system
as
antecedent
to
an
administrative
function.
but
this
is
demonstratively
not
true
because
the
thing
which
brings
this
supra
state
power
into
existence
is
the
judgment
and
determination
of
the
attorney
general
himself.
the
power
given
the
attorney
general
under
section
6
is
not
that
of
investigation.
the
government
may
call
it
an
enforcement
power
but
we
do
not
think
it
is
there.
on
the
contrary,
as
we
have
stated,
the
act
calls
for
a
mental
exercise
or
decision
by
the
attorney
general
which
in
logic
and
practice
and
reality
is
a
judicial
act.
in
other
words,
the
adjudicative
determination
depends
on
the
discretion
and
belief
of
the
attorney
general
and
how
he
viewed
the
20
or
more
complaints
which
he
has
received.
also,
on
his
judgment
as
to
the
“apparent”
of
things
as
related
to
the
ratio
whites
and
blacks
registered
to
vote
in
which
ratio
may
partially
or
entirely
be
unrelated
to
any
fifteenth
amendment
violation.
that
is
void
of
any
clear
standards,
its
application
which
is
a
judicial
function
rather
than
an
executive
one
does
depend
alone
upon
executive
discretion.
this
despite
the
law
as
well
put
by
justice
cardozo
when
he
said,
“i
can
see
that
to
uphold
a
delegation,
there
is
need
to
discover
in
the
terms
of
the
act,
a
standard
reasonably
clear
whereby
discretion
must
be
governed.”
there
is
no
such
clarity,
in
the
hodge-podge
of
determinations,
judgments,
beliefs
and
how
things
appear
to
him,
the
attorney
general
is
called
for
by
this
act.
the
states,
its
officials,
citizens
affected
by
the
exercise
of
such
indefinite
discretion
have
no
way
of
determining,
the
authenticity,
the
validity
or
the
correctness
of
any
complaints
before
these
are
received
by
the
attorney
general.
nor
do
they
have
any
opportunity
of
showing
that
a
racial
imbalance
in
registration
resulted
from
nondiscriminatory
arrangement.
for
instance,
with
all
the
encouragement
racial
agent
provocateurs
have
received.
it
is
not
unreasonable
distinction.
they
would
purposely
surreptitiously,
organize
perhaps
an
election
boycott,
so
as
to
pull
the
trigger
for
appointment
of
federal
examiners.
because
we
have
seen
that
federal
examiners
had
constantly
abused
their
authority
even
under
the
voting
rights
act.
in
alabama,
a
registered
persons
who
cannot
read
or
write,
persons
who
are
not
21,
persons
who
cannot
even
give
their
own
names,
persons
convicted
of
felonies,
persons
who
have
not
been
in
the
state
for
a
year,
persons
who
have
been
previously
raised
in
the
same
or
other
counties
thus
permitting
multiple
voting
and
also
registering
persons
with
no
effort
to
verify
where
they
live
or
whether
they
are
otherwise
qualified
under
state
law
except
for
the
voting
rights
act.
for
instance,
the
montgomery
county
board
of
registrars
has
just
shown
that
more
than
700
persons
registered
by
examiners
in
that
county
alone
are
unknown
when
notices
went
through,
that
the
address
is
given,
they
came
back.
therefore,
under
this
act,
these
persons
who
may
not
be
furnished
or
removed
from
the
list
by
state
authorities
are
still
there
and
as
the
examiners
furnished
to
the
state
officials,
election
officials,
no
means
of
identification.
then
any
700
persons
can
show
up
at
alabama
elections
where
these
examiners
issued
registration
certificates
and
proceed
to
vote.
on
the
section
11
of
the
act,
it
would
be
criminally
dangerous
for
a
state
official
to
challenge
or
fail
or
refuse
to
allow
such
a
certificate
barring
to
vote.
the
net
effect,
it
would
be
to
destroy
the
honest
and
valid
elections.
in
respect
to
one
question
being
raised,
we
wished
to
close
with
these
quotations
from
295
u.s.495,
because
it
gets
to
some
of
the
propositions
in
mr.
justice
black's
those
situations
that
we
heard.
“extraordinary
conditions
do
not
create
or
enlarge
constitutional
power,
the
constitution
established
a
national
government
with
powers
deemed
to
be
adequate
as
they
are
proved
to
be
both
in
war
and
thieves,
but
these
powers
of
the
national
government
are
limited
by
the
constitutional
grants.
those
who
act
under
these
grants
are
not
at
liberty
to
transcend
the
proposed
limits
because
they
believe
more
or
different
power
is
necessary.”
and
that
of
course
is
the
motivation
theme
and
the
real
reason
passed
for
the
passage
of
what
i
would
call
the
motion
of
legislation
that
we
heard
in
the
past.
again,
i
wish
to
thank
the
court
for
its
courtesy.
mr.
attorney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
civil
rights
commission
and
its
report
to
the
president
in
1965
had
the
following
to
say.
a
week
after
civil
rights
marches
had
been
attacked
by
alabama
law
enforcement
officers,
they
attempted
to
walk
from
selma
to
montgomery
to
dramatize
their
appeal
for
full
voting
rights,
the
president
appeared
before
a
special
session
of
the
congress
to
urge
speedy
enactment
of
voter
legislation.
the
way
the
events
of
that
march
were
presented
to
the
world
by
a
press,
radio
and
television,
stir
the
public
sentiment
that
naturally
had
its
impact
upon
the
president
and
the
congress.
that
was
a
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965.
i'd
let
the
record
clearly
show,
let
the
impression
unmistakably
be
made
that
my
appearance
here
today
and
my
argument
here
today,
serves
in
no
way
to
justify
or
defend
that
tactics
employed
by
the
state
troopers
of
alabama,
the
deputy
sheriffs
of
dallas
county
or
to
the
consequent
as
they
carried
out
their
acts
to
hold
that
march,
that
fatal
day,
there
is
no
defense.
either
legal
or
moral,
to
that
brutal
and
unwarranted
attack,
there
can
be
no
rational
defense
and
the
fact
that
the
--
of
any
orders
that
was
given
to
them
by
their
superior
officers.
no
justification
by
the
approval
given
those
law
officers
to
use
those
tactics
by
high
state
officials
in
my
state.
however,
i
do
respectfully
submit
to
this
honorable
court,
the
national
reactions
stimulated
and
brought
out,
brought
into
clear
focus
by
these
acts,
moved
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
act
swiftly,
not
only
in
an
attempt
to
wash
away
the
injustices
of
this
particular
case
but
also
the
underlying
just
grievances
of
the
negro
citizens.
whether
i
submit
that
passions
of
righteous
indignation
and
in
the
press
of
time,
neither
due
contemplation
or
sound
deliberation
was
given
to
the
resulting
legislation,
thereby
presenting
to
this
court,
background
or
setting
which
calls
for
indeed
the
searching
and
careful
consideration
of
all
of
the
arguments,
constitutional
arguments
both
for
and
against
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
state
of
alabama
expresses
very
much
concern
with
the
method
by
which
the
states
affected
have
been
brought
under
this
act.
if
not
in
fact
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
very
kindred
and
principled
to
the
way
the
legislature
of
alabama
drew
the
city
lines
of
the
city
of
tuskegee
by
statute.
statute
struck
down
by
this
court
in
gomilion
and
they're
formerly
used
to
include
certain
states
and
exclude
others,
leaves
the
excluded
states
free
to
use
literacy
test
and
local
course,
which
is
the
usual
american
way
such
as
not
true,
the
states
included
or
affected
by
this
act.
the
use
of
these
deliberate
methods,
discrimination
between
states
and
the
citizens
there
and
i
believe
is
obtained.
the
affected
states,
the
affected
states
despite
their
desire
to
have
a
literate
electorate,
now
find
the
federal
government
certifying
illiterates,
contrary
not
only
to
the
state
law
but
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
people.
so
alabama
here
today
joins
her
sister
states
in
opposition
to
this
act,
and
your
honors,
we
might
will
join
south
carolina
in
this
--
because
i
think
it
is
all
but
judicially,
and
certainly
executively
and
congressionally
declared
that
though
this
may
be
south
carolina's
lawsuit,
this
is
certainly
alabama's
law.
this
argument
on
behalf
of
alabama
is
directed
to
the
defendant's
contention
that
this
act,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
suspends
or
destroys
the
right
to
provide
that
one
must
be
able
to
read
and
write,
the
english
language
as
a
condition
precedent
to
registration.
one
who
can
read
and
write
is
literate
of
course.
the
federal
courts
in
alabama
have
repeatedly
ruled,
repeatedly
ruled
that
one
must
be
able
to
read
and
write.
they
have
repeatedly
declared
that
this
is
a
pre-requisite
to
registration
under
alabama
law.
and
the
discrimination
enjoined
in
those
cases,
i
think
some
15
in
my
state,
the
discrimination
enjoined
has
arisen
from
the
use
of
these
tests
or
the
--
these
test
to
determine
illiteracy
or
literacy
and
in
determining
whether
one
embraces
the
duties
and
obligations
of
citizenship.
for
instance,
it's
acknowledged
and
in
macon
county,
alabama
long,
lengthy
sections
of
the
constitution
were
given
to
negroes
to
read
while
shortest
sections
of
the
constitution
was
given
to
the
whites.
while
discrimination
in
the
use
of
test
and
the
demonstrations
of
literacy
had
been
enjoined
in
a
number
of
cases,
no
court
in
alabama
has
ever
decreed
that
one
need
not
be
able
to
read
and
write
in
order
to
register.
but
now,
not
only
the
commission
on
civil
rights
and
the
defendant
here
had
insist,
based
their
claims
or
contends
that
the
act
required
the
registration
of
any
otherwise
qualified
person,
even
though
he
may
not
be
able
to
read
or
write.
this
by
virtue
of
section
4
of
the
voting
rights
act,
and
yet
as
late
as
27th
april,
1965,
this
court
in
harman
versus
forssenius
said,
once
again
the
states
have
long
been
held
to
have
broad
powers
to
determine
the
conditions
under
which
the
right
of
suffrage
may
be
exercised
and
of
course
as
taught
in
lassiter,
have
the
right
to
determine
and
provide
that
only
those
who
are
literate
may
exercise
that
franchise.
this
certification
by
federal
examiners
of
illiterates
declared
--
declaring
them
qualified
to
voters
therefore
i
believe
unwarranted
in
the
states
that
have
these
literacy
requirements.
and
the
defendant's
claim
that
this
act
permits
this
if
correct
renders
section
4,
this
act
unconstitutional.
in
this
respect
is
invading
the
powers
of
the
states.
for
this
reason,
any
attempt
to
uphold
the
act
of
1965,
must
begin
with
the
determination
by
this
court.
the
act
abolishes
test
and
devices
only
that
clearly
states
this.
tests
and
devices
are
defined
in
the
act
and
defined
as
follows.
they
phrase
text
or
device
--
test
or
device
shall
mean
any
requirement
that
a
person
or
a
prerequisite
for
voting
or
registration
for
voting,
one,
demonstrate
the
ability
to
read
and
write,
understand
and
interpreting
the
matter;
demonstrate
any
educational
achievement
of
his
knowledge
on
a
particular
subject;
possessed
moral
good
character
--
good
moral
character
through
his
qualifications
by
voucher
or
registered
voters.
if
the
congress
--
if
the
congress
should
abolish
test
and
demonstration
as
to
one's
sanity
as
you
so
stated,
they
might
well
do.
suppose
that
congress
abolished
the
test
and
demonstration
as
to
one's
sanity,
who
among
us
would
contend
that
immediately
--
the
mental
incompetence
have
automatically
been
qualified
to
register
and
vote.
now,
suppose
the
congress
passed
the
law
and
suspended
the
test
to
determine
a
man's
age,
would
this
automatically
qualify
infants
to
register?
constitutional
questions
therefore
as
here
pertinent
must
start,
must
start
at
the
familiar
rules
of
construction
with
the
premises
that
tests
and
devices
only
as
defined
and
suspended
by
the
act.
not
the
requirement
itself
that
one
must
be
able
to
read
and
write,
write
tests
and
devices
only.
under
the
law
of
some
states,
the
burden
is
upon
the
applicant
to
show
his
qualifications.
by
simple
statement
under
oath,
a
simple
statement
under
oath
that
i
can
read
and
write
or
the
answer
to
a
simple
question,
can
you
read
and
write,
were
satisfied.
completely
satisfied
and
would
not
force
upon
a
state,
literate
electorate
contrary
to
its
laws.
federal
examiners
could
ascertain
this
fact
by
the
addition
of
one
simple
question
to
the
form
now
used
and
could
be
in
compliance
with
that
of
state
law
provided
their
appointment
is
held
legal.
a
person
is
asked
his
name,
there's
no
question
about
that,
it
is
accepted.
he
is
asked
his
residency,
is
it
--
has
it
the
required
link,
there's
no
question.
he
is
asked
his
age,
there
is
no
challenge.
why
couldn't
he
be
asked,
can
you
read
and
write?
why
couldn't
that
be
a
requirement?
the
department
of
justice
has
argued
in
the
cases
in
alabama
now
pending
at
section
4
(a)
of
the
voting
rights
act
prohibits
any
election
official
in
the
areas
affected
from
denying
the
right
to
be
registered
or
listed
because
one's
and
ability
to
read
and
write.
no
doubt
the
same
argument
will
be
made
here.
mr.
attorney
it
has
been
suggested
mr.
justice
that
--
mr.
attorney
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
this
question
could
be
asked
much
as
your
name,
your
address
--
mr.
attorney
it
possibly
would,
that
could
take
some
legislation.
our
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
attorney
no
sir.
mr.
attorney
no
sir,
it
would
not.
mr.
attorney
i
don't
think
so
and
i
don't
believe
that
would
require
any
legislation
the
fact
that
he'd
be
asked
the
question,
can
you
read
and
write?
of
course
he
would
--
if
you'd
then
be
subject
to
challenge,
if
you
felt
that
if
some
individual
or
some
mem
--
official
of
the
court
felt
that
he
had
lied
that
he
was
not
literate,
he
could
not
-
mr.
attorney
that
is
i
just
said
sir.
he
has
contended
in
arguments
and
cases
in
our
state
that
the
section
4
(a),
not
only
does
away
with
tests
and
devices
but
also
does
away
with
--
mr.
attorney
--
our
requirement
that
one
be
literate.
and
that's
precisely
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make,
you
see
alabama
stands
in
a
peculiar
position
here,
we
stand
convicted
some
15
times.
and
i
stand
and
admit
that
the
tests
or
devices
have
been
used
in
a
discriminatory
manner
in
my
state.
and
yet,
a
great
many
of
my
counties
as
i
will
get
to
later,
never
have
permitted
to
this
and
our
states
wishes
and
desires
that
we
have
a
literate
electorate.
i
need
to
make
a
distinction
between
tests
of
literacy
which
can
easily
be
used
and
has
in
the
past
been
used
in
my
state
for
purpose
of
discrimination,
make
a
distinction
between
tests
of
literacy
and
the
actual
requirement
that
a
person
actually
be
literate.
my
contention
is
if
the
congress
had
intended
to
prohibit
or
suspend
the
state
law
providing
or
asking
or
requiring
that
one
could
read
and
write,
it
could
have
done
so
by
just
merely
stating
the
ability
to
read
and
write
as
a
qualification
for
registration
of
voters
and
hereby
suspended
or
abolished.
that
could
have
very
easily
inserted
these
lines
that
had
the
contention
been
or
is
it
true
that
those
states
that
require
or
desire
literacy
that
congress
could
have
added
these
words
to
the
act.
the
ability
to
read
and
write
as
a
qualification
for
registration
and
voting
is
hereby
suspended
or
abolished,
these
would
have
caught
enough
states
in
this
bill
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
pass,
i
realized
this.
had
they
done
this?
but
i
do
not
believe
it
was
their
intention.
i
do
believe
it
was
the
intention
to
stop
the
use
of
these
literacy
tests.
stop
them
as
being
used
in
the
discriminatory
manner.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
the
desire
or
the
wish
of
congress
that
a
state
whose
desire
that
their
electorate
be
or
literate
electorate,
that
they'd
be
denied
the
right
to
require
that
they
read
and
write.
instead,
the
congress
of
course
went
into
great
detail
in
defining
these
tests
and
devices.
these
that
are
used
to
ascertain
literacy
and
they
suspended
these
tests
and
devices,
very
clear
on
this
act,
by
the
language
that's
very
plain
and
clear.
in
section
4
(e),
however,
as
the
person's
educated
in
american
flag
schools
in
which
the
predominant
language
was
other
than
english
the
congress
said,
it
is
necessary
to
prohibit
the
states
from
conditioning
the
right
to
vote
of
such
person
on
ability
to
read,
write
and
understand
or
interpret
any
matter
in
the
english
language.
this
is
quite
different
from
4
(e),
it
also
gives
knowledge
that
the
congress
knows
how
to
use
language
desired
to
obtain
a
given
end.
for
section
4
(e)
has
been
ruled
unconstitutional
in
morgan
versus
katzenbach
247
f.
supp.
196.
it's
also
noted
that
the
court
their
said
in
effect
and
this
is
of
course
my
main
contention
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
primarily
intended
to
prevent
discriminatory
administration
of
the
right
to
register
and
vote.
primary
intended
to
prevent
discriminatory
administration
of
the
right
to
register
and
vote.
and
during
a
hearing
before
subcommittee
number
5
of
the
congress,
the
defendant
herein
stated,
highly
literate
negroes
had
--
negroes
have
been
regis
--
refused
the
right
to
vote,
totally
illiterate
whites
have
been
allowed
to
vote.
now,
this
does
not
tell
the
entire
of
the
whole
story.
the
number
of
white
illiterates
registered
since
the
read
and
write
requirement
became
law
in
alabama
in
1951
is
very
small.
it
is
not
over
an
average
of
eight
of
ten
per
county
and
these
--
are
those
involved
in
the
suits
of
the
--
by
the
united
states.
and
the
department
of
justice,
you
understand
gets
copies
of
the
application
for
registration
in
advance.
they
searched
them
here
in
washington
for
white
registered
illiterates,
they
sent
in
the
fbi
then,
agents
to
of
course
contact
and
those
that
are
thought
to
be
illiterate
and
summon
them
to
be
a
witness
on
the
trial.
there
is
no
attempt
but
no
effort
made
to
see
have
there
been
a
few
illiterate
negroes
to
slip
through
at
the
same
time,
only
white.
and
no
case
have
they
presented
in
a
great
number,
not
in
a
great
number
and
the
registration
contrary
to
state
law
of
a
few
illiterates,
of
a
few
white
illiterates
does
not
authorize
similar
violations
to
state
law
by
the
registrations
of
thousands
--
literally
thousands
of
illiterate
negroes.
neither
does
the
registration
of
ten
--
ten
white
illiterates
authorized
a
registration
of
ten
negroes.
this
would
do
nothing
more
than
just
sanction
a
continued
violations
of
state
law.
and
in
the
united
states
versus
atkins,
323
f.2d
733,
judge
reeves
for
the
court
had
this
to
say.
rather
than
making
such
unlawful
practices
a
permanent
fixture
in
dallas
county,
the
district
court
could
on
petition
by
appellant,
urged
from
the
registration
list
those
persons
proven
by
the
appellant
to
have
been
registered
by
a
procedure
which
does
not
meet
the
minimum
requirements
of
state
law.
these
persons
could
then
reapply
for
registration
subject
to
the
same
requirements
as
anyone
else.
search
relief
would
be
within
the
broad
equity
powers
recognized
in
alabama
versus
u.s.
the
united
states
has
never
pursued
this
method,
yet
continuing
instead
in
its
efforts
to
register
negroes
without
regard
to
their
literacy
as
required
by
our
state
law.
as
to
the
administrative
remedy,
our
challenge
to
a
federal
examiner
or
the
listing
shall
be
then
obtained
that
may
within
ten
days
after
the
listing
of
the
challenged
person
is
made
available
for
public
inspection.
and
if
supported
by
affidavits
of
at
least
two
persons
having
knowledge
of
the
facts
constituting
the
grounds
for
challenge
and
certification
that
a
copy
had
been
served
either
in
person
or
by
mail
on
the
challenged
person
at
the
place
of
his
residence.
now,
the
act
is
sound
of
course
as
to
just
who
will
make
this
challenge.
and
through
december
28th,
1965,
according
to
the
civil
rights
commission,
36,161
negroes
and
190
whites
have
been
found
eligible
by
federal
examiners
in
alabama.
it
is
estimated
that
a
large
part,
possibly
even
a
majority
of
these
are
illiterates.neither
the
--
my
office
nor
anyone
else
could
follow
the
act
in
the
preparation
of
the
number
of
challenges
required
on
the
grounds
of
illiteracy.
in
addition
to
that,
illiteracy
challenges
are
futile,
since
the
examiners
have
instructions
to
certify
illiterates.
also
that
the
purpose
of
the
administrative
remedy
is
to
decide
questions
of
individual
applicants'
compliance
with
the
qualifications
required
by
the
examiners,
not
to
pass
upon
what
those
qualification
should
be.
what
is
state
law
is
a
pure
question
of
law
for
the
courts
and
not
the
examiner.
one
final
observation
before
concluding,
this,
on
the
very
day
of
the
service
of
alabama's
brief,
december
13th,
1965,
a
new
constitutional
amendment
relative
to
the
qualification
and
registration
of
electors
in
alabama
was
proclaimed
ratified.
under
the
new
amendment,
good
character
is
no
longer
required
and
the
provision
in
effect
of
november
1st,
1964
that
one
must
embrace
the
duties
and
obligations
of
citizens
--
citizenship
under
the
state
and
federal
constitution
has
been
eliminated.
now,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
provides,
however
that
when
a
state
is
covered
by
the
act
seek
to
change
these
voting
qualifications
or
procedures,
that
those
in
effect
on
november
1st,
1964
must
either
obtain
their
approval
of
the
attorney
general
or
initiate
a
federal
suit.
the
attorney
general
objects
so
if
they're
not
been
submitted
to
him
for
approval,
and
you'll
always
may
not
be
enforced
until
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
rules
the
changes
will
not
--
of
the
purpose
of
affecting
or
denying
the
right
to
vote
because
of
race
or
color
of
any
person.
it
appears
therefore
that
the
state
have
said
it
may
not
remove
conditions
which
have
thus
far
or
before
previously
led
to
claims
of
discriminations,
unless
by
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
prior
approval
by
the
defendant
himself,
a
rather,
unusual
situation
to
say
the
least.
but
i
will
say
as
my
conclusion,
i
remained
firm
in
my
conviction,
very
firm
in
my
conviction
that
every
qualified
citizen
should
be
permitted
to
vote,
that
literacy
should
be
a
basic
element
of
qualification.
discrimination
regardless
of
its
origin,
whether
it'd
be
on
account
of
race
or
color,
whether
it'd
be
on
the
use
of
literate
test
or
literacy
demonstrations,
must
be
eliminated,
discrimination
for
any
reason
must
be
eliminated.
and
as
i
previously
stated,
over
50
of
alabama's
67
counties
have
never
discriminated
in
voter
registration.
and
even
in
those
counties
where
this
pattern
has
been
found
there
has
been
great
improvement
or
of
much
progress
in
some
of
those
counties.
and
although
i
merely
ask
that
literacy
be
a
condition
precedent
or
a
prerequisite
or
a
requirement
of
voter
qualification,
i
remain
firm
in
my
view
that
it
not
only
should
be,
but
it
is
allowed
under
this
act.
now,
i
also
remain
very
firm
in
my
view
that
discrimination
should
be
eliminated
by
constitutional
means,
and
this
the
congress
did
not
do
by
the
passage
of
this
act.
the
end
sought
simply
does
not
justify
the
means
used
as
to
south
carolina
or
any
other
state
included
in
the
provisions
of
this
act.
your
honors,
i
would
submit
that
no
man,
no
man
has
for
or
shall
continue
to
fight
harder
than
i
have
to
protect
both
the
human
and
constitutional
rights
of
the
negro
and
my
state.
whether
it
be
determined
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
requires
a
registration
of
otherwise
qualified
person,
even
if
he
not
be
able
to
read
or
write,
if
this
is
required
when
the
state
statutes
clearly
require
that
a
person
be
able
to
read
and
write
in
order
to
vote,
it
should
be
struck
down
as
invading
the
powers
of
the
states.
or,
this
court
should
certainly
judicially
determine
that
this
act
does
not
or
cannot
constitutionally
prevent
states
from
requiring
a
person
be
literate
in
order
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
vote.
thank
you
so
much
for
your
time
sir.
