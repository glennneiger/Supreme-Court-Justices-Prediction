mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
30
minutes
is
going
to
be
devoted
to
the
triggering
clause.
we
did
not
cover
that
in
our
brief
because
at
the
time
that
we
file
these
particular
briefs,
or
rather
after
we
filed
these
particular
briefs,
we
--
all
of
these
were
met
and
decided
that
each
state
would
take
a
portion
of
argument
in
order
to
give
our
views
to
the
court
as
intelligently
and
as
possible.
and
it's
therefore
my
task
to
discuss
the
triggering
clause
which
puts
into
effect
the
application
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
which
of
course
is
found
in
section
4
(b)
that
that
shall
apply
in
any
state
or
in
any
political
subdivision
of
a
state
which
the
attorney
general
determines
maintained
on
november
the
1st,
1964
or
that
less
than
50%
of
such
persons
voted
in
the
presidential
election
of
1964,
provided
of
course
that
it
had
a
test
or
device
known
as
the
literacy
test.
now,
in
our
state,
the
attorney
general
determined
that
louisiana
maintained
the
test
or
device
as
defined
in
the
act.
i
might
say
that
u.s.
versus
louisiana
has
been
reconstructed.
the
government
filed
a
suit
in
a
three-judge
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
number
2866,
some
time
ago
in
which
it
sought
certain
temporary
restraining
orders
against
actions
of
state
individuals
and
registrar,
the
pleasing
of
these
names
that
the
federal
examiner
certified
on
the
roles
only
to
the
extent
that
those
were
--
who
absolutely
unqualified
to
vote
according
to
state
law
and
according
to
this
act
such
as
felons
and
so
forth
and
people
having
the
proper
residential
requirements.
of
course,
we
consented
to
being
joined,
the
government,
the
board
of
registration
has
dropped
and
myself
and
several
district
attorneys
were
added
as
defendants.
now,
we
consented
to
the
action
and
we
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
in
that
proceeding.
and
the
reason
i'm
mentioning
that
to
you
is
to
bring
out
a
point
that
i
want
to
make
that
the
determination
of
the
attorney
general
is
final
and
not
subject
to
a
review
by
court.
but
then
when
he
makes
this
action
which
puts
the
trigger
to
work,
now
there
is
some
thought
by
some
people
that
in
four
--
in
the
other
sections
of
the
act
that
a
state
could
come
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
mr.
robinson
mentioned.
but
when
this
act
is
triggered
and
a
state
is
found
to
be
under
this
particular
formula,
you
have
no
legal
recourse
from
the
determination
of
either
the
director
of
the
census
or
the
attorney
general.
and
if
you
come
to
court
in
the
district
of
columbia,
you've
got
to
first
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
that
before
you
can
go
into
your
five-year
provision
or
any
other
feature
of
the
act
that
that
forum
affords
you
if
it
does
afford
you
that
particular
relief.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
because
i
don't
think
that
the
acts
--
the
act
says
in
4
(b)
that
there'll
be
no
judicial
review.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but
yet,
you've
given
the
remedy
of
coming
to
the
district
court
of
columbia
on
certain
other
facets
of
the
case,
but
that
is
the
plan
as
to
whether
that
procedure
has
afforded
you,
not
the
way
i
understand
it.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
we've
have
to
come
in,
say
if
louisiana
filed
a
suit
and
unless
we're
successful
in
this
eastern
district
case,
we've
challenge
it
that
we
do
that
to
come
under
the
act.
in
order
for
us
to
do
it,
we're
going
to
have
to
say
in
my
opinion
that
that
portion
of
4
(b)
which
says
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review
is
that
ex
post
facto
in
nature
and
is
unconstitutional
and
that
the
courts
do
have
the
right
to
review
the
finding
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
director
of
the
census.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
now,
we
stipulated
the
government
and
the
state
of
louisiana,
rather
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana,
i'm
the
defendant
in
that
suit
and
attorney
general
katzenbach
is
the
defendant
here.
but
we'd
determined
--
the
parties
determined
that
louisiana
did
maintain
a
test
or
device
in
a
stipulation.
and
it
was
readily
admitted
that
more
than
50%
of
the
persons
of
voting
age
residing
in
louisiana
were
registered
on
november
1st,
1964.
and
we
have
stipulations
to
that
effect
in
the
record
in
that
case.
the
director
of
the
census,
however,
determined
that
that
applied
to
louisiana
because
less
than
50%
of
the
voting
age
resided
--
residing
in
louisiana
voted
in
the
presidential
election
of
november
1964.
now,
in
making
that
determination,
the
director
of
the
census
determined
that
on
november
1st,
1964,
louisiana's
adult
population
was
a
1,000,893
persons
and
that
896
persons
voted
for
president
in
the
presidential
election
on
november
1964.
this
was
also
stipulated.
louisiana's
voting
percentage
in
that
election,
therefore
according
to
that
formula
was
47.3.
now,
we
proved
in
this
case
that
the
director
of
census
was
entirely
erroneous,
because
942,226
persons
actually
voted
in
the
presidential
election
of
1964,
but
there
were
45,963
persons
that
voted
in
the
election
that
did
not
cast
a
vote
for
presidential
counting.
now,
i
say
that
that's
an
absurd
conclusion
which
this
act
does
not
authorize
because
it
says,
voted
in
a
presidential
election,
it
doesn't
say
that
you
have
to
vote
for
president.
it
doesn't
say
you
have
to
vote
for
vice-president,
it
just
said
voted
in
the
election.
and
there
were
45,900
people
who
didn't
choose
to
vote
for
a
presidential
candidate
but
voted
for
senator,
congressman
or
whatever
was
up
for
election
in
the
general
election
of
1964.
so
--
and
this
formula
that
i'm
giving
to
you
here
applies
to
all
the
states
in
question.
but
in
determining
the
number
of
persons
of
voting
age
residing
in
louisiana
on
november
1st,
the
bureau
of
census
included
adult
military
personnel
stationed
in
louisiana
who
actually
were
from
other
states.
he
also
included
convicted
felons
confined
and
at
large
on
that
date
who
are
not
restored
to
the
right
of
suffrage.
and
he
also
included
persons
in
past
prisons
and
inmates
charged
with
executions
who
cannot
vote
if
they
so
incurred.
on
november
1st,
there
were
3200
persons
confined
to
our
state
penitentiary,
who
had
lost
the
right
of
franchise
of
course.
there
were
5093
adult
convicted
felons
on
parole
or
probation.
there
were
50,000
convicted
felons
roaming
around
louisiana
who
hadn't
been
restored
to
citizenship.
and
of
course,
we
prove
this
in
this
case.
now,
in
november
the
3rd,
1964,
in
addition
to
the
above
persons
in
the
penitentiary
and
so
forth,
there
were
2338
persons
confined
in
parish
prisons
throughout
the
state.
there
were
8539
persons
who
are
inmates
in
state
charitable
institutions,
not
including
charity
hospital
in
new
orleans.
there
were
18,000
louisiana
persons
serving
in
the
armed
forces.
and
there
were
31,000
military
personnel
from
outside
the
state
stationed
in
military
post
in
louisiana,
and
that
of
course
is
in
the
record
in
that
lawsuit.
on
november
the
1st,
1964,
there
were
312,000
or
so
illiterates
ineligible
to
vote
in
louisiana
and
we
passed
a
constitutional
amendment
in
1960
which
prevented
the
illiterates.
but
at
the
time
we
froze
on
to
the
rules,
those
illiterates
who
were
then
registered
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
we
froze
in
on
the
registration
rules
over
20,000
white
illiterates
and
over
13,764
negro
illiterates.
so
there
were
44,000
persons,
therefore,
in
louisiana
not
possessing
the
necessary
residential
requirements
for
voting.
and
there
were
20,101
females,
to
use
an
expression
from
shakespeare,
bastardizing
females
who
were
ineligible
to
vote
because
under
our
law
and
under
our
constitution,
unwed
mother
with
bastard
child
is
ineligible
to
vote.
there
were
29,400
persons
convicted
of
misdemeanors
and
who
are
ineligible
to
vote
for
a
short
period
of
time.
now,
the
voting
rights
act
contemplates
registration
in
voting
and
necessarily
speak
only
of
persons
eligible
to
register
the
vote.
and
when
this
act,
of
course
the
persons
of
voting
age
residing
in
louisiana,
it
obviously
means
persons
eligible
to
vote
under
louisiana
law.
in
two
other
places
in
the
act
between
qualifications
prescribed
by
state
law
is
referred
to.
coming
back
to
my
statistics,
there
were
31,000
persons
serving
in
the
armed
forces
stationed
in
louisiana
on
november
1st,
1964
but
there
were
only
18,000
citizens
of
louisiana
who
were
serving
in
the
armed
forces
in
louisiana
and
all
over
the
world.
according
to
the
department
of
justice,
now
that
the
proper
votes
has
been
counted,
louisiana
voted
49.5
of
the
population
as
determined
by
the
director
of
census.
and
this
is
a
record
in
the
suit
i'm
speaking
about.
louisiana
missed
voting
50%
by
4000
votes
according
to
the
department
of
justice.
now,
i
submit
--
i
submit
that
if
a
number
of
armed
forces
personnel
were
corrected,
if
the
felons
who
couldn't
vote
for
our
county,
if
those
in
charitable
hospitals
were
considered,
and
if
any
of
these
factors
were
determined
according
to
the
true
facts,
which
we
submit
the
department
of
justice
and
the
census
bureau
did
not
determine,
then
louisiana
voted
far
in
excess
of
50%.
in
fact
we
had
a
demographer
of
tulane
university
who
we'd
qualify
as
an
expert,
testified
that
it
was
in
excess
of
70%
that
voted
in
the
presidential
election
of
november
1964.
now,
the
attorney
general,
i'm
sure
in
all
sincerity
told
the
congress
that
the
number
of
the
armed
forces
personnel
outside
the
state,
those
serving
inside
the
state
would
not
affect
the
percentage
of
adult
persons
voting
in
louisiana.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
need
to
amend
the
bill
or
to
delete
these
persons.
and
of
course,
the
reasons
that
the
attorney
general
told
congress
this,
was
because
he
was
unaware
at
that
time
of
the
fact
that
the
bureau
of
the
census
had
miscalculated
the
vote
in
louisiana
by
over
some
45,963
persons.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
your
honor.
no,
we
have
no
question
about
the
registration.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
it's
about
52
or
53,
your
honor,
thank
you.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
there's
no
issue
as
far
--
the
only
thing
that
brings
louisiana
into
that
and
most
of
the
other
states
that
is
involved
here
who
are
not
named
in
this
particular
act
that
who
said
they
will
put
in
as
a
result
of
this
trigger.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it's
the
voting
percentage,
did
you
understand?
you
see
texas
doesn't
have
any
literacy
test
but
--
unless
that
its
population
voted
but
they're
not
under
the
act
because
they
have
low
test.
and
that
of
course
is
one
of
the
fallacies
in
this
triggering
business.
let's
take
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
or
in
louisiana
for
that
matter.
we're
guilty
--
we're
presumed
guilty
of
discrimination
by
congress
if
less
than
50%
of
our
people
vote.
and
of
course,
south
carolina,
the
department
of
justice
both
said
that
there's
no
discrimination
in
south
carolina.
alright,
let's
suppose
that
there
is
widespread
discrimination
in
south
carolina
and
in
the
general
election
of
19
--
november
1964,
south
carolina
votes
90%,
therefore
she's
not
under
the
act.
and
that
is
one
of
the
inconsistencies
of
the
trigger
formula.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but
suppose
it
happened.
it
could
very
well
happen.
and
i
submit
to
follow
up
on
that
particular
point,
what
mr.
mcilwaine
said.
the
authority
to
stop
discrimination
presently
exists
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
it
was
placed
in
the
courts
where
it
properly
should
be
done
and
properly
should
be
handled.
but
this
act
does
one
thing,
that's
not
fast
enough.
the
judicial
process
is
not
fast
enough,
it
takes
the
matter
of
discrimination,
its
determination
and
its
judicial
determination
which
in
the
way
from
the
courts
and
puts
it
in
the
hands
of
the
department
of
justice
through
the
use
of
federal
examiners.
and
that
is
the
whole
key,
that's
the
whole
nutshell
i
argue
here
with.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
oh
yes,
definitely.
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
--
do
you
agree
with
all
of
that?
i
would
say
it's
about
78
--
no,
i
know
what
it
is,
it's
a
little
over
80%
voted
in
the
democratic
primary.
you
see
our
republican
primary
and
democratic
primary
are
at
the
same
time.
and
we're
an
overwhelming
democratic
state
and
i
think
about
80%
of
those
eligible
to
vote
participated
in
the
primary.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
--
well,
they
conduct
it
at
the
same
time.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
80%
was
in
the
primary,
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
that's
--
they're
just
conducted
in
one
and
the
same
time.
that's
all
by
80%,
little
over
80%.
one
funny
thing
about
this,
we've
got
about
--
i
think
13,000
people
would
put
on
the
rules
as
a
result
of
the
five
examiners
that
we
have.
it's
very
interesting
to
note
that
99.99%
all
are
registering
democrats.
an
evident
that
people
don't
like
to
register
as
republicans
in
louisiana,
although
republican
candidate
carried
the
election.
so
this
act
is
going
to
--
this
act
isn't
going
to
cure
that
because
all
these
people
that
are
voting,
still
votes
the
democratic
primary.
now
we
are
still
going
to
have
this
lackadaisical
apathetic
approach
to
voting
the
general
election.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
49.5.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
49,
with
your
honor,
let
me
answer
that
correctly.
49.5
voted
according
to
the
determination
of
the
justice
department
and
the
census
department.
now,
we
submit
that
it
would
be
accounted
all
of
the
factors
that
they
should've
known
it
and
that's
one
of
the
inconsistencies
of
the
triggering
clause,
no
formula
was
established
on
how
to
determine
these
people
other
than
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
department
of
justice.
and
if
they
had
counted
it
correctly,
we
would
have
had
over
70%
participating,
and
all
the
70%
did
actually
do
it
but
we'll
only
get
credit
to
49.5.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
active
participation,
yes.
that
that
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
would
still
be
way
over
50%.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
at
least
60
to
70%.
but
there's
no
other
way
you
can
figure
it
because
felons
and
persons
who
do
not
restore
their
citizenship
can't
vote.
that
hadn't
been
destroyed
by
this
act
of
congress.
but
of
course,
the
enactment
of
other
laws
had
certainly
been
stopped.
our
judicial
process
as
mr.
robinson
pointed
out
had
been
stopped
as
a
result
of
this
triggering
clause.
we,
in
louisiana,
if
we
wanted
to
say
now
that
all
persons
in
louisiana
who
18
years
of
age
would
be
eligible
to
vote,
we
wanted
to
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
to
that
effect.
we
have
to
come
to
the
attorney
general
and
say,
“mr.
attorney
general
is
this
alright?”
he'd
have
60
days
to
think
it
over.
he
didn't
reply,
you
could
go
ahead
and
do
it
or
you
could
come
to
washington
again,
in
the
district
court
of
columbia
to
submit
your
plan.
and
then
if
the
court
approved
that,
then
you
could
go
back
to
louisiana
and
pass
your
legislation.
i
think
that
that's
totally
inconsistent
with
our
constitution
because
i
don't
think
congress
ever
intended
that
the
right
to
regulate
elections
would
be
taken
away
from
the
various
legislatures.
and
i
submit
again,
that
this
only
happens
to
the
few
states
who
were
caught
in
the
trigger,
south
carolina,
georgia,
mississippi,
alabama
and
louisiana.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
act
was
adopted
by
happenstance
let's
say.
the
attorney
general
quite
frankly
conceded
during
the
hearings
that
if
this
trigger
formula
hasn't
worked
out
to
catch
those
that
he
knew
were
discriminated
that
he
had
device
some
other
system.
that's
in
the
record,
so
that
was
evidently
an
obvious
attempt
on
the
part
of
congress
to
get
these
particular
states
that
the
claimed
was
discriminating.
and
let
me
say
this
here
and
now.
we've
had
a
lot
of
lawsuits
in
my
state
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
attorney
general
in
our
office
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
one
of
these
cases,
you
ask
questions
to
louisiana.
the
federal
court
said
to
21
registrars,
you've
been
using
this
literacy
test
to
discriminate.
now,
we
don't
say
that
you
don't
have
the
right
to
have
a
literacy
test
but
we
say
you
keep
discriminating
with
the
use
of
this
test.
and
you
submit
me
a
report
every
month,
telling
me
how
many
people
have
been
registered
and
whether
you
use
the
test
and
whether
you
applied
the
test
to
everybody.
now,
we've
got
21
registrars
of
voters
in
louisiana
who
report
to
the
courts
monthly.
telling
them,
how
they
had
been
running
their
offices
and
then
we
have
other
suits
that
found
discrimination
to
exist.
even
in
plaquemines
parish,
the
registrar
there
has
been
reporting
to
the
court
for
31
months.
and
in
fact,
the
courts
have
actually
been
operating
at
least
half
of
our
parishes
or
maybe
a
third
of
our
parishes
by
court
order
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but
this
act
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
certainly.
that's
what
courts
have
thought
under
our
system
of
separation
of
powers.
there
was
never
any
intent
on
the
framers
of
our
constitution
on
anybody,
to
just
turn
over
or
overturn
it
to
the
attorney
general
the
discretion
of
running
registrar's
offices
in
the
various
states.
now,
let
me
give
you
just
a
little
example
of
how
far
that's
gone.
just
the
other
day,
mr.
doar
wrote
me
a
letter
by
which
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
had
set
out
to
all
of
the
registrars
in
my
parish.
and
it's
a
very
nice
letter
and
it
goes
on
down
here
and
it
says,
compliance
has
been
fine,
everything
is
going
long
good,
everybody's
happy.
then
he
says,
number
one,
have
all
practices
which
delayed
to
discourage
the
registrations
that
abandoned.
and
then
a
new
practice
has
been
adopted
which
tend
to
discourage
registration
of
potential
voters.
now,
as
a
registrar,
he
would
determine
who
a
potential
voter
is.
what
identification
requirements
are
being
used?
are
the
procedures
being
used
more
onerous
than
those
which
were
used
in
registration
of
white
citizens
in
the
past?
are
citizens
who
seek
to
qualify
to
vote
being
treated
fairly
and
courteously?
what
law
says
that
the
registrars
got
to
be
courteous
to
anybody?
he
says,
he's
got
to
be
fast,
sure
in
registration
but
i
don't
have
to
say
good
morning,
how
are
you
doing,
anything
like
that
when
i
come
in
to
register
to
vote.
but
the
attorney
general
wants
my
registrars
to
do
that,
then
we've
come
down
here
a
little
further
and
he
says,
finally
in
conducting
registration,
it
makes
good
sense
to
be
open
during
longer
hours
or
during
some
evenings
or
on
saturday.
our
legislature
prescribes
the
time
that
the
registrar's
office
will
be
open
and
where
it
would
be
located.
and
that's
been
upheld
in
the
case
of
united
--
i
forget
the
title,
but
the
gallinghouse
case,
judge
elis
in
the
eastern
district
who
since
retired
said
that
the
registrar
has
got
to
file
a
state
law
and
he's
got
to
conduct
his
office
of
registration
where
the
law
provides.
namely,
the
county
ceded
the
facts
in
which
this
case
is
new
orleans
which
i
understand
everybody
in
which
it's
got
a
beautiful
setup
down
there.
and
then
he
goes
on,
to
be
open
during
long
hours
or
during
some
evenings
or
on
saturday
or
to
employ
extra
place.
now,
here
as
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
telling
us
we've
got
to
hire
extra
place,
appropriations
for
this
matter,
comes
from
the
police
juries
or
the
board
of
supervisors,
whose
going
to
pay
for
that?
but
to
hold
registrations
in
each
polling
places
and
each
municipality,
then
i
believe
you
should
do
so,
if
that's
not
a
clear
mandate
from
the
attorney
general
to
tell
our
registrars
how
to
operate
their
office
and
how
to
operate
and
operate
in
contrary
to
louisiana
law,
which
we
can't
change
unless
we
come
up
here
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
voluntarily
bring
our
witnesses.
if
a
witness
doesn't
want
to
come,
we
can't
make
him
come
because
this
is
more
than
a
100
miles
away.
so
i
said,
when
you
considered
all
these
states,
you
considered
this
triggering
clause
that
the
particular
states
involved
were
pit
out
because
they
wanted
to
put
all
these
people,
everybody
on
the
rules.
let
me
show
you
a
little
something
here.
california's
got
a
literacy
test.
they
got
over
half
a
million
illiterates
in
california
possibly
because
they
got
more
people
than
any
state
in
the
union.
and
these
people
can't
vote
in
california
but
they
can
vote
in
louisiana
under
this
act
or
they're
being
discriminated
against.
and
this
act
doesn't
help
them
because
the
date
of
the
formula
is
november
1st
or
the
presidential
election
of
1964,
that's
the
cut-off
date.
those
that
are
not
affected,
massachusetts'
interveners
in
amicus
curiae
and
so
as
new
jersey
and
several
other
states.
they're
not
affected
by
this
act,
how
can
it
concern
them?
what's
their
interest?
they
have
no
interest.
it
doesn't
apply
to
them
at
all.
let's
take
idaho.
idaho
is
(inaudible)
on
illiterate
ground.
he
can't
vote
up
in
idaho
because
of
this
formula
because
of
this
triggering
clause.
that
he
could
come
to
louisiana
and
after
serving
the
requirement
of
that
time,
he
can
vote
in
louisiana.
that's
why
we
say
it's
an
act
of
discriminatory.
that
that
was
the
standard
that
doesn't
apply
to
everybody
and
actually
discriminating
because
the
only
people
affected,
the
only
people
would
ever
do
it
is
five
or
six
states
involved
and
of
course
the
last
would
just
have
to
get
caught
within
that
and
some
couple
of
county
didn't
in
maine
and
arizona
and
idaho,
just
happened
to
get
caught
that
they
would
like
to
vote
--
the
people
of
the
county.
now,
i
say
to
your
honor
that
five
years
from
our
time
is
awful
good.
i
think
it's
an
issue
of
special
legislation
and
that
this
legislation
which
already
existed
by
act
of
congress.
here,
we
have
nothing
but
shortcut
to
make
it
go
faster,
faster
and
faster
and
faster.
without
a
resort
to
the
congress
for
registration
procedures,
without
the
result
in
the
court
being
conventional
or
arbitrary
over
this.
this
is
not
only
to
decide
in
which
--
which
essential.
let
me
tell
you
something
by
this
court.
do
you
criticize
us
when
you
hear
a
lot
of
crimes,
you
had
the
right
to
criticize,
you're
wrong.
but
i
have
great
faith
in
this
court
because
i
believe
that
in
the
final
hour,
this
court's
wanted
to
do
its
duty
and
this
court
is
going
to
find
that
congress
cannot
take
over
the
judiciary
which
he's
doing
in
this
particular
legislation.
and
no
one
can
say
as
we
said
in
our
brief
that
you've
been
dragging
your
feet
because
you
haven't
done
it.
you've
been
on
top
of
these
cases,
like
a
powerful
--
chasing
the
burden,
and
you
should
have
been.
you've
done
a
good
job.
let's
continue
to
do
this
job.
let's
run
this
country
according
to
the
constitution.
thank
you
your
honor.
let's
run
this
country
according
to
the
constitution
the
way
it
should
be,
not
just
one
part
of
the
constitution
but
all
of
it,
consider
the
gaps.
i'd
say
this,
the
legislation
is
genius.
it
was
designed
for
the
sake
of
people.
we
got
caught
if
it's
for
the
defendant
names,
places,
they're
not
constitutionally
on
its
face
but
i
ask
you
your
honors
(inaudible)
rectify
these
injustices,
this
is
to
be
done
in
court
where
it
should
be.
thank
you.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
can
be
very
simply
stated.
section
2
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
gives
the
congress
an
express
power
to
enforce
the
prohibition
contained
in
section
1
against
the
denial
or
abridgment
of
voting
on
account
of
race
or
color.
we
simply
contend
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
is
appropriate
legislation
viewed
as
a
whole
and
its
operating
context,
it's
well
adapted,
it
operates
fairly
and
reasonably
to
achieve
the
objective
which
is
as
explicitly
within
the
power
of
congress
to
achieve
and
indeed
the
provision
which
puts
a
duty
on
the
congress
to
enforce
that
provision
of
section
1.
in
developing
this
position,
i
want
first
to
describe
the
actual
problem
of
compliance
as
it
was
presented
to
congress
and
as
it
exists
in
fact
as
congress
faced
and
understood
it.
the
so-called
triggers
contained
in
section
4
of
the
act
aren't
mere
mechanical
abstractions
pulled
out
of
the
air.
they
can't
be
fairly
viewed
or
understood
in
isolation
from
their
function,
in
relation
to
other
provisions
of
the
act.
for
example,
to
the
problem
of
enforcement
of
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
understood
by
congress,
these
triggers
are
temporary,
automatic,
suspension
of
inherently
dangerous
test
and
devices
and
they're
coupled
with
the
provision
in
section
4
(d)
which
permits
more
detailed
judicial
inquiry
at
the
request
of
any
state
or
subdivision
affected.
in
these
two
sections,
section
4
should
be
seen
as
a
single
integrated
measure
for
solving
problems
revealed
by
experience
and
demonstrated
to
congress
by
ample
testimony.
so
after
outlining
the
problem
which
was
before
congress
and
the
relationship
to
the
act
to
the
solution,
if
time
permits,
i'll
take
up
some
specific
objections
raised
against
it.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
legislative
record
can
demonstrate
it
visually
mr.
justice
that
these
are
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no
sir,
as
the
references
to
that
record
appear
with
frequency
in
the
briefs
mr.
justice.
the
problem
before
congress
was
compounded
by
the
three
separate
distinct
elements.
first,
literacy
test
and
similar
test
and
devices
for
determining
the
qualification
of
voters
were
widely
used
and
they're
being
wildly
and
persistently
used
as
engines
of
racial
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
so
congress
focused
its
attention
first
upon
literacy
test.
secondly,
despite
prior
legislation
to
enforce
section
1,
congress
with
ample
justification
concluded
that
the
scheme
of
prior
legislation
case
by
case,
county
by
county,
parish
by
parish
adjudication
had
proved
too
slow
and
ineffective,
a
remedy
for
continued
denials
on
a
widespread
basis
of
the
most
basic
of
all
rights.
and
thirdly,
there
was
urgent
need
in
the
national
interest
to
secure
compliance
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
secure
compliance
now.
turning
first
to
tests
and
devices
as
engines
of
discrimination;
section
4
(c)
defines
test
and
devices
as
including
any
requirement
for
the
persons
of
prerequisite
for
voting
or
registration
for
voting,
demonstrates
the
ability
to
read,
write,
understand
or
interpret
any
matter,
demonstrate
any
educational
achievement
or
it's
knowledge
on
any
particular
subject,
possess
good
moral
character
or
prove
his
qualifications
by
the
voucher
of
registered
voters
or
members
of
any
other
class.
in
so
defining
test
and
devices,
congress
used
experience
before
it
to
strike
at
those
forms
of
qualification,
most
inherently
capable
of
abuse
and
where
in
fact
there
was
evidence
that
they
had
been
repeatedly
abused
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
there
was
no
such
evidence
with
respect
to
current
contemporary
virginia
mr.
justice.
the
point
that
i
am
making
here
is
that
these
tests
so
defined,
had
in
fact
been
used
as
engines
of
racial
discrimination
in
various
states
and
counties
where
suits
had
been
brought,
where
the
observation
of
objective
observers
had
noted
them
and
they
had
been
used
and
used
repeatedly
on
a
widespread
basis
in
this.
now,
in
fashioning
the
particular
trigger
in
this
instance,
we
contend
that
the
congress
was
capable
and
had
the
power
to
include
on
a
temporary
suspension
basis,
areas
where
it
believed
there
was
an
inherent
danger,
the
possibility
that
these
tests
were
being
abused,
and
it
did
not
require
to
have
evidence
in
front
of
it
that
they
were
in
fact
being
abused
at
this
particular
moment
in
the
state
of
virginia
or
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
or
in
any
of
the
particular
counties
or
in
the
state
of
alaska
that
were
covered
by
the
trigger.
the
trigger
was
based
upon
the
fact,
i
hope
to
demonstrate
in
this
argument
that
these
tests
were
inherently
dangerous
that
they
had
in
fact
on
many
instances
been
used
for
purposes
of
racial
discrimination
and
that
the
existing
remedies
of
the
law
were
inadequate
and
that
for
those
reasons
in
those
areas
where
congress
believed
they
had
been
so
used
or
there
was
a
danger
that
they
would
be
so
used,
they
could
temporarily
suspend
them
awaiting
a
more
refined
judicial
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
in
those
areas
they
were
being
abused.
the
congress
provided
that
if
in
fact
they
were
not
being
abused
and
had
not
recently
been
abused
then
the
proceeding
was
set
up
so
that
the
state
could
escape
from
the
coverage
of
section
4.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
possible
for
congress
to
have
suspended
or
even
abolish
these
tests
perhaps
in
every
state
where
they
were
used.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
the
difficulty
with
that
and
i
would
not
--
i
think
they
could
mr.
justice
have
suspended
them
at
least
in
every
state
because
of
this
danger
had
they
chosen
to
do
so.
i
think
the
reason
that
they
did
not
was
that
that
raises
more
difficult
questions
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
legislation
and
it's
propriety
because
it
was
clear
to
congress
that
in
at
least
some
states,
there
was
very
little
possibility
of
these
being
abused
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
i
think
the
question
raises
the
difficult
point,
can
congress
abolish
or
even
suspend
tests
in
areas
of
the
country
where
to
make
the
case
most
clear,
there
are
no
negroes?
and
is
that
necessary
and
proper
to
the
enforcement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
for
congress
to
choose
an
area
where
there
are
few
or
no
negroes
and
say
that
you
have
to
do
this
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
congress
attempted
here
to
make
a
more
refined
judgment
on
that
score
and
if
i
would
emphasize
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no
sir,
under
the
--
the
question
was
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
--
i
do
not
take
that
position.
i
said
that
i
thought
that
would
raise
a
more
difficult
question
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
that
legislation
then
i
think
is
raised
by
the
case
before
us
mr.
justice.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
could
not
go
so
far
on
the
basis
of
the
history
and
experience
of
the
application
of
these
tests.
i
said
it
was
more
difficult
because
it
would
mean
the
abolition
of
these
tests
in
parts
of
the
country
where
they
couldn't
possibly
be
used
to
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
but
if
i
had
to
come
down
with
the
decision
on
that,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
is
a
rather
broad
statement.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no
question
mr.
justice
that
there
had
been
discrimination
of
various
kinds.
i
have
no
evidence
of
discrimination
in
voting
but
in
many
states
outside
of
the
--
of
the
south.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
two
sir.
one
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
other
before
a
three-judge
court
in
new
york.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
may
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
not
for
involving
the
statute.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
or
one
involving
discrimination
remains.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
have
a
literacy
test
in
sixth
grade
education.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
as
i
moved
in
by
the
appointment
of
the
examiners
in
four
states
in
mississippi,
alabama,
louisiana
and
south
carolina.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
has
not
moved
to
virginia.
it's
not
moved
in
georgia,
it's
not
moved
in
alaska.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
that
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
mr.
justice
white
that
forbids
the
naming
of
a
particular
states.
i
think
that
states
could
have
been
named
if
the
basis
for
their
naming
was
objective
and
even
handed
i
would
think
that
the
results
of
this
--
they
could
have
been
named
in
the
statute.
i
think
there's
a
good
deal
of
political
resistance
to
that
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
taste
and
forms
and
desires,
i
think
there's
another
reason
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
a
part
of
the
explanation
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
consideration
perhaps
they
never
even
got
to
the
questions
whether
or
not
there
were
legal
considerations.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
does
identify
the
states
but
there's
always
the
possibility
as
indicated
indeed
by
the
--
by
the
hearings
as
compared
with
facts
afterwards
and
the
application
of
the
formula,
the
information
before
congress
was
not
absolutely
exact.
for
example
in
the
testimony
you'll
find
that
34
counties
in
north
carolina
are
included
within
the
trigger
whereas
in
fact
after
a
more
refined
examination
by
the
census,
it's
only
28
so
that
people
were
let
in
and
out
in
that
phases,
and
that
raises
the
difficulty
i
think
mr.
justice
white
with
respect
to
congress
actually
naming
at
any
given
state
because
if
the
formula,
the
objective
basis
for
naming
them
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
knew
what
they
were
covering
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
i
think
it's
extremely
important
that
they
did.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
knew
what
the
law
was
going
to
cover
and
i
regard
that
as
an
extremely
important
fact.
it
was
stated
yesterday
by
counsel
for
some
of
the
states
that
i
had
said
in
testimony
that
before
congress
that
if
it
had
not
covered
the
states
in
which
we've
had
repeated
litigation,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
formula
was
not
a
particularly
a
good
formula.
i
think
it's
important
that
congress,
and
i
--
i
would
stand
on
that
position.
if
the
formula
adopted
by
the
congress
had
not
covered
any
of
the
states
where
there
had
been
litigation
involving
voting
then
i
would
have
thought
that
formula
was
a
pretty
unreasonable
one.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
that
was
suggested
by
the
louisiana.
there
was
a
difference
between
the
house
of
senate
versions.
the
senate
version
would
have
included
a
provision
that
20%
of
the
population
be
non-white
and
was
not
included
within
the
house
version.
it's
presently
not
in
the
law,
but
congress
had
before
it
and
i
would
give
emphasis
to
it
the
information
that
in
these
states,
the
percentage
of
white
--
of
non-white
population
according
to
the
census
statistics
was
preceded
20%
in
all
save,
two
states
of
louisiana
--
of
alaska
and
virginia
where
it
was
a
little
bit
in
excess
of
18%.
and
further
to
that,
if
you
took
the
percentage
of
non-white
population
out
of
the
census
with
respect
to
all
states,
you
would
find
the
first
six
states
--
first
seven
states
would
include
these
six
southern
states
only
arkansas
which
has
no
literacy
test
would
appear
in
that
as
a
percentage
of
non-white
to
white
population
and
the
congress
was
very
much
aware
and
i
think
it's
relevant
and
important
to
the
enforcement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
there
is
in
terms
of
inherent
risk
a
substantial
non-white
population
that
at
least
could
discriminate
it
against
within
those
states.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no.
the
united
states
did
not
mr.
justice
concede
this
in
any
of
these
states.
we
said
with
respect
to
virginia
that
we
had
no
current
evidence
of
the
abuse
of
literacy
test
in
the
state
of
virginia.
we
said
something
substantially
similar
that
in
south
carolina
although
we
did
have
some
investigations
going
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
at
that
point.
it
was
also
explained
in
the
hearings
by
the
attorney
general
that
under
a
conscious
policy
in
the
department
of
justice,
our
resources
had
been
aimed
at
those
areas
where
we
knew
the
voting
discrimination
was
most
widespread
simply
as
an
enforcement
policy
we
had
brought
suits
within
--
particularly
within
mississippi,
northern
louisiana
and
alabama
and
down
through
the
black
belt
counties
because
this
was
the
most
flagrant
areas
of
abuse
as
far
as
voting
was
concerned
and
that
we
believed
that
there
might
be
voter
discrimination,
other
instances
would
not
be
of
the
same
massive
character.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
believe
that
alaska
has
filed
at
this
point
in
the
district
of
columbia.
it's
either
done
so
or
indicated
its
intention
to
file.
i
believe
it
filed
just
the
other
day.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
--
mr.
justice,
the
law
was
--
the
case
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
that
it
was
directed
at
specific
areas
where
congress
believed
on
all
of
the
evidence
before
it
that
discrimination
in
voting
had
occurred
and/or
were
believed
from
other
things
before
the
congress
there
was
a
real
inherent
danger
in
using
such
tests
and
devices
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
those
areas
were
by
and
large
identified
and
repeatedly
discussed
in
the
hearings.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
i
would
see
some
objections
sir
to
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
constitutional
objections
to
not
selecting
your
states
on
the
basis
of
the
same
objective
criteria.
i
think
that
--
i
do
not
believe
that
the
congress
could
have
selected
alabama
simply
because
it
was
alabama
or
for
one
reason
or
another
of
that
kind.
i
think
it
could
adopt
any
objective
formula
and
as
long
as
it
treated
people
within
an
objective
formula
aimed
at
getting
at
the
aim
to
be
able
to
be
cured,
it
could
have
chosen
to
name
the
particular
areas
that
fitted
into
that
--
into
that
definition.
but
i
think
it's
important
that
the
criteria
that
congress
used
or
even
handed
criteria
as
far
as
the
states
are
concerned.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
because
i
think
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
appropriate
legislation
has
to
be
judged
by
it's
reasonableness
in
terms
of
dealing
with
problem
and
after
they're
dealing
with
the
problem
of
the
use
and
abuse
of
literacy
test
which
was
a
problem
faced
by
congress
then
i
think,
however,
wide
or
narrow
that
net
is
cast,
it
has
to
be
appropriate
to
the
dealing
with
this
particular
problem.
and
in
the
face
of
the
record,
i
was
talking
to
the
actual
record
in
front
of
congress,
with
that
record
in
front
of
them
to
have
said
we're
going
to
direct
this
legislation
against
alabama,
but
not
against
mississippi
or
louisiana
would
have
raised
very
serious
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
an
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
because
i
could
not
find
any
rational
basis
for
the
inclusion
of
alabama
and
the
exclusion
of
mississippi.
i
can't
find
a
rational
basis
for
the
way
in
which
a
particular
net
here,
the
trigger
was
determined.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
those
three
are
particularly
easy
mr.
justice
stewart
because
in
none
of
those
three
is
there
a
test
or
device?
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
problem
mr.
justice
stewart
was
to
deal
with
tests
and
devices
which
had
been
repeatedly
abused.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
by
dealing
with
tests
and
devices,
it
seems
to
me
that
attention
has
to
be
focused
on
those
states
that
have
them.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct,
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
other
evidence
before
congress
which
could
lead
it
on
a
temporary
suspension
to
suspend
those
tests
and
devices
in
virginia
until
there
had
been
more
refined,
detailed,
judicial
inquiry
into
the
question
whether
they
were
currently
being
abused.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
the
inference
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
may
have.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
there's
no
inference,
no.
i
don't
think
there's
no
inference
of
discrimination
(voice
overlap)
situation
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
abuse
of
tests
and
devices.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
act
covers
all
discrimination.
there
are
procedures
set
out
in
section
3
and
prior
legislation
continues
to
exist
which
enabled
the
government
to
deal
in
a
more
traditional
way
with
discrimination
in
other
areas.
there
was
a
testimony
before
congress
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
others.
they
believe
that
while
discrimination
might
exist,
areas
not
using
tests
and
devices
that
the
problems
of
establishing
and
proving
and
curing
this
by
the
process
of
lawsuit
were
not
as
in
super
bowl
as
difficult
and
as
die
near
impossible
as
they
have
proved
to
be
where
you
had
tests
and
devices.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
congress
was
concentrating
on
dealing
with
these
aspect
of
the
problem
while
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
had
been
put
on
the
15%
provision,
i
would
put
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
congress
was
dealing
with
tests
and
devices.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
but
i
can
bring
a
suit
and
there
can
be
with
the
consent
of
the
court
with
the
appointment
of
an
examiner
right
away.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no
sir,
under
section
3
of
this
law
which
expands
that
power.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
perhaps
i
did
not
express
myself
well
on
that.
this
act
deals
with
all
of
the
problem,
but
it
deals
with
different
means
and
mechanisms
of
discrimination
in
different
ways.
this
act
covers
all
of
the
50
states,
but
it
deals
with
those
states
which
had
literacy
test
differently
or
at
least
some
of
those
states
which
have
literacy
tests
differently
than
it
deals
with
states
which
do
not
have
literacy
test
because
the
problem
of
the
literacy
test
was
in
view
of
congress
a
very
special
problem
with
respect
to
enforcing
the
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
there
are
21
states
that
have
literacy
tests
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
in
terms
of
low
voter
turnout
that
you
get
this
kind
of
correlation.
there
are
21
states
that
have
literacy
tests.
there
were
nine
states
in
which
less
than
50%
of
the
people
voted
in
the
1964
election.
that
includes
seven
of
the
states
that
have
literacy
tests
and
only
two
did
not
to
the
correlation
between
a
low
voter
turnout
and
the
literacy
test
is
good
in
that
direction.
if
you
turn
that
correlation
around,
look
at
the
other
14
states
with
literacy
test
and
find
that
in
those
cases
the
voter
turnout
in
1964
was
above
the
national
average
in
every
single
one
of
those
14
states.
so
the
low
voter
turnout
can't
be
geared
simply
to
the
existence
of
literacy
test.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
we
--
you
mean
in
past
experience?
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
it's
all
been
--
we've
had
more
as
far
as
the
literacy
test
themselves
are
concerned,
we
had
more
difficulty
at
first
with
a
more
comprehensive
and
vague
understanding
tests
which
were
used
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
it
would
be
all
part
of
one.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they're
just
different
forms
of
tests
that
can
be
used
in
this
situation
and
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
we've
had
a
variety
of
different
kinds
of
tests.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well
we've
had
problems
with
--
in
the
lawsuits
that
we've
brought
with
respect
to
voucher
difficulties
and
with
respect
to
the
good
moral
character
where
it's
been
differently
administered
with
respect
to
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
the
reason
for
examiners
and
--
being
appointed
into
mississippi
has
been
the
fact
that
mississippi
does
not
interpret
the
federal
law
as
abolishing
all
forms
of
literacy
test
and
they
require
a
filling
out
of
a
simple
application
in
some
counties
and
i've
felt
under
the
act
that
--
where
that
was
required
i
was
obligated
to
--
where
illiterates
were
being
turned
down
that
i
was
obligated
to
appoint
a
federal
examiner.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
all
of
--
in
mississippi
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
no,
mississippi
did
it
after
they've
passed
the
voting
rights
act
by
constitutional
amendment,
mississippi
greatly
simplified
its
prior
laws
on
this
subject
and
reduced
them
down
to
fairly
normal
kind
of
a
literacy
test
as
far
as
the
other
states
are
concerned.
it's
a
very,
very
simple
test.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
those
laws
are
suspended
under
this
act.
other
state
laws
continue
for
example,
laws
which
prohibit
felons
from
voting
or
not
touched
by
the
statute.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
are
required
to
--
they
cannot
apply
mr.
justice
stewart
any
law
with
respect
to
literacy
because
this
act
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
or
any
law
not
objective
kind
of
law
with
respect
to
good
moral
character.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
they
--
there's
nothing
that
no
objection
to
the
prior
convictions
and
they
can
refuse
to
do
that.
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
state
law
--
some
state
laws
are
suspended,
the
ones
described
here
in
section
4
(a).
they
would
continue
to
register
under
those
state
laws
that
were
not
suspended.
federal
examiner
within
the
area
would
continue
to
apply
those
state
laws
not
suspended
by
section
4
(a).
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it's
pretty
hard
mr.
justice
to
make
a
judgment
about
good
moral
character
unless
you
have
something
like
criminal
conviction.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
as
long
as
that
state
is
within
the
accomplice
of
the
act.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
mwell,
the
challenge
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
the
challenge
authority
is
there
--
the
person
is
really
a
resident
of
the
area
if
he's
convicted
of
felony
if
he's
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
other,
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
that
is
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
section
2
has
any
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
it's
just
a
general
statement
of
the
really
--
which
required
already
by
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
by
the
constitution,
yes
sir.
now
--
but
it
doesn't
have
any
operative
effect
that
you
would
not
have
i
would
say
by
the
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
save
insofar
as
the
attorney
general
authorized
from
--
to
bring
a
suit
or
for
it's
enforcement.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
unless
to
the
extent
that
would
come
under
the
--
the
provisions
of
section
12
because
there
is
an
explicit
reference
to
section
2
there,
“whoever
shall
deprive
or
attempt
to
deprive
any
person
with
any
rights
secured
by
section
2
and
other
sections
shall
violate
section
11
(a)
or
(b)
should
be
fined
and
so
forth.”
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
“or
whoever
conspires
to
violate
the
provisions.”
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
if
we
were
using
it
with
a
requisite
criminal
intent,
i
think
that
it
could
be
under
section
12.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
if
he
is
using
it
to
deprive
him
of
his
vote
on
account
of
color,
i
think
that
it
would
be
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
can
be.
it
doesn't
have
accomplished
the
purpose
of
getting
people
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
entitled
to
register
and
vote.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
well
then
those
provisions
are
quite
broadly
drawn
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
believe
yesterday,
mr.
robinson
raised
the
objection
with
respect
to
sections
11
and
12,
but
didn't
discuss
it
at
that
time.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
as
far
as
those
sections
are
concerned,
i
don't
think
the
facts
of
their
actual
application
are
presently
before
the
court
as
far
as
the
criminal
sanctions
are
concerned
and
i
would
think
that
the
focus
of
attention
should
be
as
it
has
been
in
the
argument
on
the
sections
that
are
presently
operative
and
that
are
in
dispute
which
are
sections
4
(a)
and
5
and
other
sections
relating
to
the
appointment
of
the
examiners
and
so
forth.
section
11
and
section
12
whatever
their
constitutionality,
i
believe
must
be
constitutional.
it
might
await
another
time
where
the
facts
of
a
particular
prosecution
were
here
and
the
court
would
consider
those
sections
in
the
light
of
facts
of
an
actual
case.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
pass
on
this
time
and
i
question
the
desirability
of
passing
on
those
sections
at
this
particular
time.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
there
was
at
least
one
bill
before
congress
that
considered
that
as
a
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
alternative
to
this.
there
were
a
number
of
alternatives
to
this
that
were
considered
in
congress
and
this
is
the
alternative
that
congress
in
its
wisdom
selected.
i
think
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view
it's
my
job
to
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
uphold
this
and
appropriate
legislation
and
not
to
second
guess
the
congress
of
the
united
states
as
to
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
better
way
of
accomplishing
the
objective
which
congress
sought
to
accomplish.
the
fact
that
most
of
these
tests
and
devices
are
non-discriminatory
on
their
face
or
the
fact
that
most
of
these
could
be
administered
fairly
its
between
the
raises,
i
don't
think
it's
controlling.
the
courts
held
that
discrimination
and
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
outlawed
whether
it's
accomplished
by
it's
procedural
or
substantive
means,
whether
it's
sophisticated
or
simple
minded
and
as
this
court
explicitly
noted
in
lassiter,
a
literacy
test
fair
on
its
face
maybe
employed
to
perpetuate
the
discrimination
which
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
designed
to
uproot.
and
let
me
make
a
point
here
which
one
made
repeatedly
before
congress
and
it's
a
very
important
point
in
the
administration
of
these
laws.
it
would
be
wrong
to
think
of
these
laws
as
simply
being
unfairly
applied
to
negroes
and
regard
the
problem
as
one
of
securing
their
fair
application
to
members
of
the
negro
race.
because
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is
equally
important
that
they
haven't
been
applied
at
all
or
that
they
have
been
applied
at
less
than
the
statute
would
require
as
far
as
white
citizens
are
concerned
and
this
was
very
much
in
congress'
mind
when
they
were
there,
so
that
there
is
no
cure
by
saying
from
now
on
let's
make
sure
that
the
tests
are
fairly
applied
to
negroes
because
you
have
a
problem
of
the
easy
use
of
these
problems
testified
to
in
case
after
case
after
case
has
been
litigated
where
it
means
whites
gone
on
the
rolls
and
did
the
--
as
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
said
yesterday,
there's
before
the
enactment
of
this
act
there
were
35,000
illiterates
on
the
rolls
in
louisiana
and
while
there's
a
great
deal
had
been
made
about
all
the
wisdom
of
an
intelligent
electorate
in
the
use
of
the
literacy
test
even
in
south
carolina's
argument.
i
notice
that
south
carolina
by
her
own
constitution
says
either
you
have
to
be
literate
or
you
have
own
a
second
hand
car
in
order
to
vote
because
it
has
a
$300
exemption
you
can
get
out
of
being
literate,
you're
wise
enough
to
vote
if
you
get
$300
of
personal
property.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
but
i'm
pointing
out
that
each
of
these
states,
each
of
these
states,
there
are
many
illiterates
on
the
roll.
now,
this
court
is
heard
a
great
deal
about
literacy
and
the
value
of
literacy.
the
fact
is
that
even
under
their
own
statutes
there
are
great
many
illiterates
registered.
even
under
their
own
statutes
there
are
a
great
many
illiterate
whites
who
presumably
under
even
handed
administration
should
not
have
been
registered
and
i'm
saying
that
it's
being
cured
with
this
problem
with
the
suspension
of
these
tests.
but
the
congress
took
that
into
account
and
said
in
terms
of
getting
rid
of
violations
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
effects
of
test
violations
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
this
is
an
appropriate
way
to
do
it.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
congress,
no,
mr.
justice
stewart
to
enact
the
only
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
another
fourm
i
would
do
(voice
overlap)
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
would
have
been
possible
to
have
done
it
in
that
way
and
to
have
a
completely
registration
of
everyone
who
was
(voice
overlap)
by
federal
state
law.
i
can
understand
that
--
why
congress
would
reject
that
as
being
a
much
more
harsh
in
effect
than
this
particular
legislation,
and
certainly
in
another
forum
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
did
defend
this
as
the
best
legislation.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
think
in
this
instance
to
understand
this
best,
what
congress
did
was
to
say
“literacy
test
can
be
and
have
been
used
as
engines
of
discrimination”
and
therefore,
we
ought
to
suspend
literacy
test.
look
at
a
great
deal
of
other
evidence
before
it
and
said
in
order
to
meet
the
danger
that
literacy
test
can
be
used
as
engines
of
discrimination.
it
is
not
necessary,
although
i
think
they
could
have
so
done,
to
suspend
them
in
all
21
states
or
we
can
be
more
refined
in
that.
they
then
looked
at
the
other
evidence
before
them,
they
looked
at
the
number
particularly,
the
number
of
people
voted
in
that
election
that
was
hotly
contested
and
hotly
contested
in
these
areas
in
1964
and
felt
that
some
inference
could
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
these
states
were
way
below
the
national
average
i
their
voting
turnout.
now,
it
can
be
said
that
--
it's
been
said
that
there's
no
relationship
between
voting
and
registration
because
it's
an
obvious
relationship.
you
can't
vote
if
you
aren't
registered
and
the
fewer
the
people
register,
the
fewer
the
people
are
eligible
to
vote
and
one
would
except
some
drop
in
the
voting
figures
from
that
alone.
not
satisfied
with
this
alone,
congress
examined
who
would
be
covered
by
this
trigger
and
what
did
they
find
when
they
examined
it?
what
they
found
was
that
in
these
states
that
six
of
the
seven
states
covered
had
a
history
of
racial
discrimination
coming
into
the
recent
test
with
respect
to
other
matters
other
than
voting.
four
of
them,
there
had
been
judicial
findings
with
respect
to
patterns
and
practice
of
discrimination
in
voting.
they
had
a
non-white
population
as
i've
emphasized
more
than
20%
in
five
of
these
six
states.
they
also
looked
at
the
registration
figures
and
if
they
look
at
the
registration
figures
they
found
registration
for
whites
was
in
all
states
twice
what
it
was
for
negroes
and
in
at
least
one
state
more
than
10
times
what
it
was
for
negroes.
the
congress
had
all
of
this
in
front.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
and
it
have
a
literacy
rate
of
these
states
in
front
of
it
and
as
you
raise
the
question,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
like
to
make
two
points
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct
and
the
suggestion
that
south
carolina
makes
is
there's
20%
of
their
population
illiterate
and
that's
true
as
far
as
the
functional
illiteracy,
as
far
as
the
census
bureau
is
concerned,
there
are
20%,
but
that
means
not
having
achieved
fifth
grade
education
and
now
the
literature
does
not
equate
with
the
literacy
test
in
south
carolina
nor
does
it
equate
with
the
$300
left
hand
exemption
in
south
carolina.
furthermore
than
that,
although
south
carolina
did
not
emphasize
it
in
its
brief,
the
same
figures
show
that
after
some
70
years
of
constitutional
mandate
to
give
at
least
equal
education
to
negroes
within
the
state
then
on
those
--
with
those
literacy
rates
as
they
say
it's
approximately
11%
of
the
white
population
and
44%
of
the
negro
population
and
in
fact
the
median
education
in
south
carolina,
the
median
rate
of
education
was
twice
and
it's
about
10.2
years
of
school
which
is
just
about
the
national
average
of
10.4
median
education
for
negroes
is
5.4
less
than
six
years.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
the
highest
is
in
louisiana.
i
don't
have
the
figure
at
the
moment
and
it's
significant
because
23%
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
in
louisiana,
i
guess
louisiana
had
actually
a
higher
registration
figures
in
many
of
these
other
states
involved.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
they
must
be
very
young.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
but
again
i
would
caution
that
you're
using
a
definite
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
the
test
there
from
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
might
be
statutory.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
because
if
to
say
south
carolina
for
example
were
to
enact
a
six-year
educational
requirement,
it
would
immediately
eliminate
half
of
the
negroes
in
south
carolina,
but
it
would
eliminate
very
few,
if
any,
of
the
whites
and
i
raise
the
point
because
i
would
at
least
raise
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
state's
failure
to
give
equal
educational
opportunity
in
the
past
and
over
the
past
70
years
whether
that
can
be
used
now
in
order
to
disenfranchise
large
numbers
of
their
own
citizens
on
the
basis
that
they
have
not
achieved
a
certain
achievement
of
literacy
when
that
falls
unequally
upon
the
races
and
when
the
fact
that
that
falls
unequally
upon
the
races,
can
be
put
today
as
it
could
not
have
been
put
back
at
the
time
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
can
be
put
today
squarely
on
the
statute
of
the
state
involved
because
it's
been
under
an
obligation
to
avoid
that
inequality
for
over
70
years.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
question
is
not
before
(voice
overlap).
it's
not
before
the
court
at
this
point,
no
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
would
be.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
i
intend
to
go
into
that
legislative
history
in
some
detail,
but
i
would
suggest
it
differently
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
was
premising
my
point
on
the
fact
that
they
had
an
obligation
for
schooling
which
was
not
an
obligation
that
they
had
in
--
when
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
passed
in
1867,
but
it
is
an
obligation
which
they've
had
since
before
the
turn
of
the
century.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
that.
it
was
discussed
that
--
it
was
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
was
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
was
one
of
the
considerations
which
congress
obviously
had
on
it's
mind
and
i
raise
it
for
that
reason,
but
this
legislation
is
not
based
on
the
--
it's
based
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
it
was
suggested
by
several
that
if
it
hit
somewhat
unequally
as
far
as
literacy
was
concerned
that
prior
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
shouldn't
now
frustrate
congress
in
enacting
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
come
to
in
this
case.
now
the
common
thread
and
the
point
that
i
want
to
give
the
most
emphasis
to
is
the
actual
abuse
of
these
tests
and
devices
and
their
inherent
possibility
of
abuse
and
the
fact
that
congress
had
before
it
great
evidence,
many
of
these
areas
although
not
all
of
them
that
in
fact
it
had
been
abused.
in
addition,
the
congress
had
before
it
evidence
that
many
of
these
tests
and
devices
had
their
frank
and
candid
inception
with
respect
to
a
desire
to
discriminate
against
negroes.
they
had
been
designed
for
that
explicit
purpose
while
in
some
states
this
went
back
many
years,
in
other
states
for
example
in
louisiana
record
this
court
is
familiar
with
that
same
purpose
was
being
stated
by
legislators
in
the
1960s.
we
have
brought
over
some
70
cases
involving
tests
and
devices
of
this
kind.
32
of
which
have
come
to
final
judgment
and
in
all
32
a
pattern
of
discrimination
was
found
and
we've
been
upheld
either
by
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
and
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
problem,
schnell
against
davis,
united
states
against
thomas,
and
alabama
against
united
states,
louisiana
against
united
states,
united
states
against
mississippi,
all
cases
before
this
court
have
been
testing
the
fact
that
the
sorts
of
tests
and
devices
outlaw
suspended
in
statute
before
us
have
been
grossly
abused
in
their
administration.
and
the
same
facts
have
been
found
by
others
presented
to
congress.
i
could
quote
as
we
do
in
our
brief
from
professor
keith
who
says
flatly
that
the
southern
literacy
test
was
a
fraud
and
nothing
more
and
there
were
testimony
before
congress
that
frequently
that
the
test
was
applied
to
negroes
only,
they're
not
fairly
not
applied
to
whites
at
all.
we
go
in
at
some
length
to
the
history
of
discrimination.
the
history
of
purpose,
the
fact
is
that
you
had
a
history
that's
been
before
this
court
time
and
time
again.
you
start
it
with
your
older
clauses,
your
fighting
grandfather
clauses,
that
kind
of
thing
in
order
to
keep
negroes
from
the
franchise.
you
went
from
there
into
such
things
as
the
--
the
white
primer,
those
issues
came
before
this
court.
the
congress
acted
in
an
attempt
to
deal
with
this
problem
in
1957,
1960,
and
1964.
the
point
is
that
here
is
the
fifteenth
amendment
on
the
books
for
95
years
and
a
long
history
of
devices
which
opened
up
the
opportunities
to
bad
motivated
registrars
to
abuse
them
back
in
many
instances
where
the
legislation
history
indicates
that.
indeed,
if
you
look
to
the
good
moral
character
test,
they
were
used
primarily
as
an
exemption
for
many
literacy
requirement
saying
well,
if
the
person
wasn't
literate
but
the
registrar
found
him
to
be
of
good
moral
character,
he
could
register
anytime.
an
application
that
was
made
to
white
citizens
much
frequently
than
it
was
to
negro
citizens
and
still
another
form
of
exemption
clearly
had
a
racial
purpose
in
it's
origin
was
the
$300
property
qualification
which
is
in
the
south
carolina
statute
a
qualification
which
to
say
the
very
least
that
there's
literal
relationship
to
the
kind
of
issues
discussed
as
to
the
need
for
literate
voters
but
there's
a
significant
relationship
to
race
in
the
state
such
as
south
carolina
where
the
incidence
of
poverty
is
so
much
greater
among
the
negroes
than
it
is
among
the
whites.
indeed,
the
same
kind
of
literacy
test
prescribed
by
south
carolina
was
reviewed
by
this
court,
united
states
against
alabama
and
this
court
affirmed
a
judgment
that
such
a
test
had
been
used
as
an
engine
of
discrimination.
now,
the
district
court
with
that
opinion
vividly
described
how
the
alabama
test
which
is
identical
with
this
had
been
manipulated
thus
demonstrating
at
least
the
potential
in
the
statute
that
it
could
be
used
as
they
had
in
fact
been
used
in
alabama
as
an
engine
for
discrimination.
and
indeed,
the
congress
had
before
it
an
existing
fact,
the
court
decisions
which
have
demonstrated
the
fact
that
these
tests
and
devices
were
not
given
to
whites
at
all
in
clarke,
forrest,
georgia,
panola,
sunflower,
tallahatchie,
and
walthall
counties
in
mississippi
and
macon,
sumter
counties
in
alabama,
jackson,
plaquemines
parish
in
louisiana
and
others.
and
so
there
was
some
justification
for
the
senate
in
concluding
as
it
did
in
its
report
when
it
said
and
i
quote
“in
suspending
the
use
of
tests
and
devices,
congress
would
be
applying
to
negroes
the
‘law'
applied
to
whites”,
and
the
word
law
there
is
ending
in
a
quote.
was
that
record
first
which
was
before
congress?
secondly,
the
congress
had
before
it
failure
prior
records
to
obtain
compliance
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
a
recourse
to
judicial
relief
found
that
those
are
proved
genetically.
now,
our
constitutional
system
rests
on
the
proposition
that
when
a
valid
law
is
enacted
and
when
the
constitution
is
amended
or
already
exists,
the
state
and
local
officials
in
good
faith
comply
with
federal
law
in
supremacy
with
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
they've
taken
oath
--
taken
an
oath
to
uphold,
but
unfortunately
in
matters
of
high
emotional
content
such
as
race
relations,
this
hasn't
always
been
the
case.
and
so,
a
remedy
that
says
and
in
fact
in
our
federal
system
sometimes
rarely
a
person
will
not
act
as
he's
meant
to
act,
an
officer
of
the
law
or
state
official,
such
an
instance
you
can
go
to
court
and
that
works
as
long
as
those
are
exceptional
circumstances
and
as
long
as
its
good
faith
compliance
and
it
simply
hasn't
work
in
the
voting
field.
beyond
that,
fifteenth
amendment
doesn't
speak
just
to
the
federal
government.
the
fifteenth
amendment
speaks
to
the
states.
it
imposes
obligations
directly
upon
them
to
secure
compliance
with
the
fifteenth
amendment.
there's
been
no
such
record
in
many
states
and
indeed
the
contrary
is
too
often
been
the
case.
we
have
found
in
many
of
our
lawsuits
not
that
the
state
was
in
there
and
anxious
to
cure
a
situation
clearly
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
it
was
in
there
making
motions
and
defending
on
narrow
and
technical
grounds
what
had
been
going
on
and
making
no
effort
to
cure
it.
and
i
think
that
a
great
deal
of
burden
was
best
put
upon
the
judiciary
and
upon
the
lower
courts
and
upon
this
court.
the
congress
sought
for
the
first
time
and
i
think
it
waited
too
long
a
period
of
time
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
the
1957
voting
rights
act
would
authorize
the
united
states
to
bring
suit
wherever
persons
had
been
deprived,
not
at
least
equalizing
to
a
certain
extent
the
burden
had
been
put
on
a
private
plaintiff
who
have
the
faith
to
secure
his
right
to
vote
or
to
have
it
vindicated
and
then
actually,
it
was
always
dependent
to
the
taxpayers'
expense
that
brought
the
united
states
in
to
this.
and
we
found
quickly
congress
did
the
violations
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
were
too
widespread
to
make
that
relief
adequate
and
the
act
was
amended
in
1960
so
as
to
permit
the
courts
to
deal
with
violations
which
went
beyond
individuals.
that
is
to
say
to
put
in
the
provisions
for
federal
registration
where
a
pattern
of
practice
was
found
to
exist
into
a
point
where
we
believe
to
register
eligible
voters
whenever
the
government
was
able
to
demonstrate
that
pattern
of
practice.
it
also
provided
absolute
right
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
to
examine
voting
records
despite
the
fact
that
this
remedy
was
in
many
respects
unique,
despite
vigorous
efforts
by
the
department
of
justice
that
again
can
only
be
concluded
to
be
a
failure.
the
record
before
congress
complete
with
testimony
and
concrete
individuals
of
resistance
to
its
enforcement.
even
such
relatively
clear
rights
is
that
to
examine
voter
records
were
resisted
by
state
and
local
officials
who
insisted
upon
making
every
motion
and
every
argument
possible
under
the
law
and
i
recall
in
one
case
we
took
over
four
years
simply
to
secure
the
voter
records.
and
mississippi,
the
state
of
mississippi
two
weeks
before
the
enactment
of
the
1960
act
repealed
its
state
law
which
made
the
destruction
of
voter
records
unlawful
so
that
registrars
would
be
free
to
destroy
records.
furthermore,
the
problems
the
counsel
this
morning
conceded
of
proving
a
pattern
or
practice
are
formidable
problems.
again
those
were
illustrated
by
a
testimony
before
congress,
thousands
upon
thousands
of
man-hours
spent
in
the
examination
of
records
alone,
10,000
man-hours,
12,000
man-hours
simply
to
examine
voting
records
to
see
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
can
be
found
from
those
records
because
it's
extremely
difficult
to
get
the
testimony
of
citizens.
one
can
get
the
testimony
often
of
negro
citizens
deprived.
it's
extremely
difficult
to
get
the
testimony
of
white
citizens
who
haven't
taken
a
literacy
test
or
who
had
been
helped
by
the
registrar.
occasionally,
this
comes
out,
one
can
see
it
in
the
records,
case
of
occupation
forms
in
one
area.
we
did
note
a
coincidence
of
some
11,000
forms
--
1100
forms
that's
made
out
with
the
same
handwriting,
all
white,
so
that
each
case
was
vigorously
fought
and
enforced
at
every
level
through
the
courts
and
the
average
time
in
securing
relief
and
relief
which
often
wasn't
adequate
relief
exceeded
two
years
not
including
the
year
or
so
that
was
necessary
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
had
the
facts
on
which
to
base
a
complaint.
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
resort
to
the
judicial
process,
but
the
point
before
congress
was
whether
or
not
delays
taken
in
this
way
whether
or
not
taken
in
good
faith,
the
result
was
delay
and
delay
and
delay
and
delay
in
securing
this
right
and
congress
was
very
conscious
of
that
realizing
that
every
election
that
went
by
where
a
person
was
wrongfully
given
the
right
to
vote
--
denied
the
right
to
vote
was
irretrievable.
while
i've
heard
discussion
of
distinguished
counsel
on
the
other
side
about
the
delusion
of
the
vote
of
literates
and
those
who
have
$300
with
people
who
can't
meet
that,
let
me
suggest
to
this
court
that
there's
another
delusion
in
here
because
every
single
person
who
was
wrongfully
denied
his
right
to
vote
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
dilutes
the
vote
of
every
single
other
person
who
would
have
voted
in
the
same
way.
the
argument
cuts
in
two
ways
with
respect
to
that.
so
it
was
the
conclusion
of
congress
that
county
by
county,
parish
by
parish
lawsuit
was
simply
inadequate
to
deal
with
this
problem.
and
after
statewide
action
in
this
court
is
familiar
with
them
were
inadequate
for
the
same
reason.
state
legislature
was
acting
to
frustrate
the
will
of
congress
enacted
two
tests
and
devices
in
mississippi,
in
louisiana
had
elsewhere
and
that
bears
upon
the
reason
for
section
5
in
this
legislation
and
attempts
to
set
aside
these
efforts
were
meant
with
procedural
points
which
require
the
united
states
to
come
to
this
court
for
resolution.
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
mississippi,
a
process
involving
36
months
from
the
filing
of
the
complaint
without
even
hearing
on
the
merits.
the
congress
said
before
it
and
the
facts
to
test
almost
countless
illustrations
of
frustrations,
delay
and
the
adequacy
of
the
remedy
under
existing
law
to
deal
with
these
hardcore
areas.
the
most
dramatic
example
because
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
1965
act
was
the
litigation
in
dallas
county
which
was
testified
to
at
length
by
the
attorney
general
and
it
appears
in
the
senate
hearings
at
page
10
and
12
and
it
gives
any
capsule
kinds
of
frustrations
in
vindicating
of
right
which
we
were
faced
with,
but
that's
not
a
unique
example.
somehow
alabama
was
not
a
unique
example.
the
plain
fact
was
that
adequate
remedies
simply
could
not
be
achieved
by
the
process
of
lawsuit
within
any
reasonable
period
of
time
in
the
foreseeable
future.
so
the
sort
of
delay
that
was
illustrated
by
experience
under
the
1957
and
1960
acts
made
it
clear
to
congress
that
some
more
effective
system
of
enforcing
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
required.
so
it
was
faced
with
a
problem
of
devising
legislation
which
recognized
both
the
importance
of
achieving
the
right
to
vote
and
of
enumerating
the
grievances
and
the
loss
of
confidence
in
the
political
institutions
of
the
united
states
and
especially
in
the
judicial
process.
congress
went
and
enacted
this
legislation
not
enacting
it
because
of
my
distinguished
colleagues
suggest
because
of
pressure.
congress
had
before
it
in
1965
a
crisis
situation
in
the
sense
of
a
simply
a
loss
of
confidence
in
the
political
institutions
of
this
country
to
deal
with
that
problem,
to
deal
with
enforcement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
and
it's
that
reason
why
it
was
so
important
that
congress
had
enacted
this
piece
of
legislation
that
could
secure
for
it
compliance
now
before
the
disillusionment
with
the
whole
process
of
democratic
government
and
the
supremacy
of
the
rule
of
laws
set
in.
and
so
as
those
three
facts,
public
sentiment
not
only
among
negroes,
but
among
others,
among
all
citizens
outraged
at
incapacity
to
deal
with
this
problem
against
that
factual
record
of
the
use
and
abuse
of
these
tests.
and
the
whole
nation
looked
to
congress
to
find
the
workable
solution,
a
solution
which
would
both
establish
the
integrity
and
viability
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
even
more
importantly
as
i
suggested
the
integrity
of
the
viability
of
our
basic
democratic
political
institution.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
attempted
this
morning
to
describe
the
situation
that
congress
faced
it
and
so
on
and
faced
with
those
three
elements,
literacy
test,
record
of
the
abuse
of
literacy
test,
massive
scale
in
some
areas
and
with
the
need
for
finding
an
effective
and
efficient
solution
which
the
congress
had
failed
to
find
prior
legislation
as
to
the
process
of
litigation
that
crafted
this
legislation.
and
i
think
it's
worth
the
point
of
emphasis
that
in
doing
so
--
well,
as
i
said
in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
fortas
while
the
act
covers
discrimination
in
voting
anywhere
this
was
a
particular
problem
which
it
focused
upon
in
view
of
the
record
in
front
of
it
in
the
history
of
past
abuses.
and
in
that
sense,
as
it
treated
literacy
test
differently
or
at
least
by
a
different
method
of
enforcement.
and
so
it
determined
to
have
provided
for
the
suspension
of
tests
or
devices
coupled
with
a
potential
appointment
of
federal
examiners
in
those
places
where
in
the
judgment
of
congress,
the
danger
of
racial
discrimination
in
voting
rights
was
greatest.
faced
with
the
need
for
immediate
and
effective
action,
it
provided
for
the
initial
use
of
semi-automatic
objective
criteria,
so-called
triggers,
which
incorporated
the
information
immediately
available
to
congress
to
determine
where
those
tests
had
in
fact
been
abused
indicated
by
prior
litigation
and
decisions
of
courts
or
where
in
the
judgment
of
congress
the
danger
of
the
abuse
was
greatest.
congress
recognized
as
i
said
earlier
that
given
more
time,
a
refined
judicial
inquiry
could
lead
to
different
conclusions.
therefore,
it
preserved
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
sue
for
injunctive
relief
under
prior
voting
acts
and
in
fact
strengthened
that
power
somewhat
in
section
3
and
for
areas
outside
the
so-called
trigger
that
it
authorized
any
state
within
the
standards
to
sue
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating
that
in
truth
and
in
fact
tests
and
devices
were
not
being
and
had
not
in
the
immediate
past
been
used
as
engines
of
discrimination.
thus,
the
triggers
govern
only
for
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
in
which
the
goal
of
compliance
for
the
fifteenth
amendment
without
delay,
required
action
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
best
available
information
pending
a
full
investigation,
pending
a
full
hearing
on
the
actualities
of
your
use
for
discrimination.
after
that,
judicial
decision
replaces
the
triggers.
now
there
would
seem
to
be
only
two
possible
objections
to
this
approach.
the
first
is
that
congress
has
no
broad
authority
to
enact
legislation
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
deal
with
the
substantive
evil,
but
that
that
section
can
be
used
only
to
provide
procedural
remedies,
including
criminal
sanctions.
and
the
second
would
be
that
the
machinery
established
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
lacks
any
reasonable
relationship
to
its
objective
and
in
that
sense
is
not
appropriate
legislation.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
it's
our
view
and
i
had
thought
to
include
that
in
my
first
objection
when
i
--
when
i
stated
that
it
can
only
do
procedural
matters
rather
than
substantive
but
it
is
our
view
that
congress
under
this
express
power
contained
in
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
the
same
power
that
it
has
in
any
other
express
powers
that
it
has
throughout
the
constitution
and
that
it
can
enact
legislation
to
achieve
the
mandate
of
section
1
for
the
only
limitation
being
that
it
--
that
legislation
has
to
be
appropriate
to
the
achievement
of
that
end
and
i
would
take
that
to
be
the
same
as
any
other
power
that's
given
to
congress
and
i
think
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
don't
suggest
that
it
can
take
away
rights
which
you're
explicitly
guaranteed
particularly
in
the
area
of
individual
rights,
but
surely
and
all
the
history
indicates
with
respect
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
well
as
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
can
prohibit
state
laws,
state
actions,
which
are
in
violation
or
can
be
used
in
violation
or
are
being
used
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
i
think
it's
--
you
know
it's
really
an
exaggeration
to
talk
about
the
congress
providing
specifically
that
the
qualifications
are
to
be
decided
by
the
states
as
though
that
were
similar
to
your
fifth
amendment
point.
what
the
congress
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
what?
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
--
what
the
constitution
says
there
and
i
think
it's
really
to
determine
the
voting
in
federal
elections
and
your
constitutional
history
as
you
recall,
there
was
considerable
fear
rather
ironic
fear
today
that
the
federal
government
would
impose
two
rigid
restrictions
on
the
franchise
and
it
would
not
be
sufficiently
democratic
and
for
that
reason
that
it
was
determined
that
the
qualification
would
be
those
of
the
lowest
house
under
the
state
government.
but
it's
merely
a
method
of
describing
the
--
who
is
permitted
to
vote
in
federal
elections
and
simply
assumes
as
indeed
all
other
parts
of
the
constitution
assume
that
the
--
that
the
power
is
not
given
expressly
to
the
federal
government
or
reserved
for
the
states
and
i
think
it
is
no
different
situation
than
any
other
rights
reserved
to
the
state.
now,
it's
our
view
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
sir,
i
would.
i
would
think
that
it
gained
and
this
court
has
said
so
that
an
express
power
given
to
congress
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
discrimination
in
voting
and
that
it
says
that
congress
can
deal
with
that
by
appropriate
legislation.
and
i
think
under
that
section
mr.
justice
black
congress
has
the
power
not
merely
to
guard
against
past
violations
but
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
future
violations
wherever
that's
a
reasonable
judgment
and
assessment
to
make,
to
eliminate
tempting
opportunities
which
have
in
fact
on
the
basis
of
experience
whether
it's
in
that
state
or
another
state,
it's
been
widely
abused.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interpretation
given
by
section
2
of
--
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
is
contrary
to
the
interpretation
of
this
court
to
other
similar
express
powers
contrary
to
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
contrary
to
judicial
precedent
in
this
court
with
respect
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
now,
a
general
principle
constitutional
law
is
that
the
breathe
for
legislative
discretion
is
still
as
it
was
and
as
expressed
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
mcculloch
against
maryland
that
they
can
be
legitimate
let
it
be
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution
and
all
means
which
are
appropriate
which
are
plainly
to
that
end
and
which
are
not
prohibited
that
it
consists
through
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution
are
constitutional
that
this
rule
is
equally
applicable
to
the
amendments
of
the
constitution,
that's
certainly
demonstrated
by
everard's
breweries
against
day
where
this
court
stated
that
the
congress
is
not
limited
to
such
measures
as
are
indispensably
necessary
to
give
effect
to
it's
express
power.
the
history
of
the
adoption
both
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
supports
in
our
judgment
the
view
that
the
enforcement
section
was
intended
to
be
treated
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
other
affirmative
powers
of
the
federal
government.
that
is
to
say
appropriate
legislation
was
legislation
which
was
necessary
and
proper
to
carry
out
section
1
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
that
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
ex
parte
virginia
where
speaking
of
the
--
all
the
post
war,
civil
war
amendments,
this
court
said,
whatever
legislation
is
appropriate
that
is
adopted
to
carry
out
the
objects
the
amendments
have
in
view,
whatever
it
tends
to
enforce
submission
to
the
prohibitions
they
contain
and
to
secure
all
persons
the
enjoyment
perfect
equality
of
civil
rights
and
equal
protection
of
the
law
against
state
denial
or
invasions
if
not
prohibits
it
is
brought
within
the
domain
of
congressional
power.
in
that
same
decision,
this
court
pointed
out
explicitly
that
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
derived
much
of
their
force
from
their
enforcement
provisions
which
enlarge
the
power
of
congress
to
achieve
the
--
end
sought
by
the
prohibitions
themselves
of
the
first
section.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
absolutely
true
mr.
justice
harlan
and
there
are
the
differences
which
you
assumed
in
your
question
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
we
don't
contend
that
immediately
upon
the
passage
of
the
amendment
in
1870,
before
the
states
here
affected
had
adopted
any
tests
and
devices
the
congress
could
then
at
that
point
have
banned
their
use
and
banned
it
for
all
time.
there
were
those
who
foresaw
the
future
at
that
time
and
thought
that
the
test
ought
to
be
banned
by
section
1
itself
to
put
into
the
constitution
and
banned
in
that
way
and
their
view
didn't
prevail
and
the
great
bulk
of
the
debates
is
to
whether
or
not
the
congress
should
in
section
1
banned
off
such
devices
because
they
realized
even
then
that
these
would
be
capable
of
discriminatory
application.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
follows
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
the
debates
that
indicated
that
section
2
therefore
left
the
congress
powerless
to
deal
with
those
tests.
if
it
hasn't
happened
in
fact,
they
later
were
in
fact
used
as
engines
of
discrimination
and
in
fact,
the
natural
inference
from
section
2
and
its
inclusion
is
that
it
was
put
in
to
permit
later
congresses
to
deal
effectively
with
whatever
problems
arose
with
respect
to
the
implementation
and
enforcement
of
section
1.
that
was
its
function.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
there
was
relatively
little
on
section
2
and
it's
--
but
it's
not
accurate
to
say
that
those
who
wrote
section
2
thought
congress
could
never
reach
voting
qualifications.
for
example,
i
have
a
quotation
here
from
senator
howard
and
he
said
this
“suppose
that
after
the
reorganization
of
the
government
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
for
example,
the
voters
in
the
state
shall
see
fit
to
divest
the
colored
man
there
of
his
right
to
vote”
and
i
assume
that
he
means
or
at
least
includes
the
legislature
of
south
carolina
in
that.
he
then
continues
“the
only
mode
in
which
the
right
to
vote
could
be
restored
to
the
colored
man
in
that
state
would
be
under
the
subsequent
clause
in
this
amendment
giving
congress
--
giving
to
congress
the
power
to
carry
out
and
effectuate
this
clause
by
appropriate
legislation
so
that
congress
would
then
if
it
saw
it
fit
step
in
and
remedy
the
defect
of
the
state
law
and
restore
to
the
colored
man
his
right
to
vote.
this
might
be
the
case
in
more
than
one
state
of
this
union.
it
might
indeed
be
the
case
in
all
states
of
the
union
and
congress
would
be
called
upon
to
exercise
an
authority
under
the
second
clause
of
this
amendment
and
to
impart
by
direct
congressional
legislation
to
the
colored
man
his
right
to
vote.
no
one
can
dispute
this.”
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
this
quotation
does
not
appear
in
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
in
our
--
in
our
brief?
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
senator
howard.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
he
was
a
proponent
of
the
--
of
the
amendment
that
appears
in
the
--
in
the
congressional
globe
48th
congress
3rd
session
at
page
1625
and
there
are
a
number
of
other
quotations
to
it,
somewhat
similar
view
when
dealing
with
section
2.
i
think
its
important
mr.
justice
harlan
that
remember
that
senator
howard
was
one
of
those
who
preferred
a
broader
first
section,
but
he
explains
his
reason.
there
wasn't
any
doubt
about
the
power
of
congress
to
deal
with
engines
of
discrimination
under
section
2
in
the
future.
and
what
it
was
rather
and
it
comes
out
clearly
in
debates
are
theory
that
congress
when
it
became
less
republican
might
fail
to
exercise
the
powers
that
were
granted
to
it
under
section
2
and
the
proponents
of
the
more
radical
view
wanted
to
freeze
that
into
the
constitution
at
that
time.
their
fear
was
not
a
constitutional
fear,
their
fear
was
simply
that
that
if
it
were
not
done
future
congresses
would
not
take
full
advantage
of
section
2,
and
indeed
i
might
say
history
bears
them
out
to
a
considerable
extent
because
there
has
been
precious
little
with
respect
to
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
despite
it's
widespread
noncompliance
and
violation
over
the
years
to
first
small
steps
in
1957
and
then
followed
by
this
legislation
in
1965.
so
i
would
think
the
enforcement
power
here
was
just
as
broad
as
it
was
elsewhere.
and
indeed
as
mr.
justice
black
suggests
it
maybe
broader
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
than
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
let
me
emphasize
that
the
voting
rights
act
doesn't
attempt
to
stretch
it
beyond
quite
familiar
boundaries
and
this
legislation
while
broader
in
scope,
does
nothing
different
in
time
and
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
approved
when
ordered
by
a
court
of
equity.
davis
against
schnell
was
determined
at
alabama
as
understanding
the
test.
it
violated
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
because
the
registration
board
was
given
arbitrary
power
to
accept
or
reject
electorate.
further
use
of
that
test
was
enjoined.
in
louisiana
against
the
united
states,
this
court
affirmed
the
judgment
for
the
united
states
which
found
that
the
louisiana
interpretation
test
on
its
face
and
as
applied
was
part
of
an
unconstitutional
plan
to
deprive
negroes
of
its
vote
--
of
their
right
to
vote.
and
this
court
at
that
time
stated
and
it's
one
of
the
basis
for
this
piece
of
legislation
that
the
lower
court
had
the
power
and
duty
to
render
a
decree
which
will
so
far
as
possible
eliminate
the
discriminatory
effects
of
the
past
as
well
as
bar
like
discrimination
in
the
future
and
it
approved
the
decree
entered
by
the
district
court
which
enjoined
the
future
use
of
the
louisiana
interpretation
test,
and
also
enjoined
in
21
parishes
of
adoption
of
the
new
citizenship
test
which
had
been
passed
for
a
previous
use
of
the
interpretation
test
that
greatly
reduced
the
proportion
of
negroes
registered
to
vote
at
least
until
such
time
that
there
would
be
a
complete
re-registration.
and
our
proposition
that
is
simply
stated
is
that
such
power
exists
in
the
federal
judiciary
to
enforce
the
mandate
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
likewise
exists
in
the
congress
under
the
specific
authority
of
section
2.
in
fact,
congress
does
not
only
like
that
even
a
broader
power
and
that's
clear
from
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court.
it
has
established
principle
of
constitutional
law;
we
believe
that
congress
may
exercise
its
expressed
powers
to
deal
potential
evils
at
least
where
the
restriction
is
reasonably
related
to
the
danger
to
be
met.
this
court
expressly
said
in
north
american
against
sec,
the
evils
disclose
themselves
which
entitled
congress
to
legislate
as
it
did.
the
congress
has
the
power
to
legislate
generally
unlimited
by
the
proof
of
existence
of
the
evils
in
each
particular
situation.
now
clearly,
congress
didn't
lack
the
problem
or
the
power
to
meet
the
problem
as
it
did
and
i
think
the
other
question
would
be
whether
or
not
that
formula
which
we've
discussed
is
reasonable.
and
to
a
certain
extent,
i've
already
discussed
this
in
response
to
questions
i
like
--
just
briefly
to
review
why
we
think
the
test
itself
is
reasonable.
again,
i
would
put
emphasis.
the
problem
the
congress
was
facing
was
the
abuse
of
literacy
test
as
a
particular
part
of
a
larger
problem
of
discrimination
in
voting.
its
attention
was
focused
upon
that
abuse
and
it
therefore
directed
its
attention
in
the
first
instance
to
those
states
which
maintain
test
or
devices
of
this
kind.
it's
concentrated
upon
those
21
states
and
from
the
facts
as
they
exist
as
they
were
presented
to
congress,
the
mere
presence
of
such
laws
gives
light
to
the
inference
that
they
could
be
used
as
engines
of
discrimination.
but
congress
didn't
rest
on
that
inference
alone.
it
sought
by
other
criteria
to
refine
its
judgment
and
one
such
test
clearly
is
how
many
people
are
participating
in
the
political
process
and
it
took
as
a
criteria
for
that
participation
in
a
hotly
contested
election
particularly
hotly
contested
election
in
the
states
involved
here
and
concluded
that
where
the
number
of
people
going
out
to
vote
was
significantly
less
than
the
national
average,
50%
as
against
some
62%
on
the
national
average
and
if
you
eliminate
these
states
or
you
contrast
them,
it's
about
an
average
of
43
as
against
an
average
of
about
66%.
it's
a
big
gap.
that
one
inference
that
could
be
drawn
would
be
that
qualified
citizens
were
being
denied
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
one
--
only
one
that
really
is
relevant
is
the
voting.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
the
reason
for
that
is
very
simple
sir.
the
reason
is,
well,
i
think
registration
figures
would
have
been
better
and
i
think
congress
felt
the
same
way,
it's
more
directly
related
to
this
problem.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
fact
is
you
couldn't
get
completely
accurate
registration
figures.
while
you
can
find
in
the
record,
registration
figures
as
derived
from
various
different
sources
and
i
would
assume
that
they
are
in
general
accurate.
they
don't
have
the
accuracy
and
--
of
the
census
determination
as
to
who
voted
in
the
presidential
election.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
as
to
how
many
voted.
so
that
they
went
one
step
--
i
think
congress
would
have
taken,
i
think
this
is
borne
out
by
the
record
registration
if
they
have
had
accurate
figures
on
registration.
what
they
wished
to
avoid
was
the
whole
series
of
lawsuits
with
respect
to
the
accuracy
of
registration
figures
and
indeed
there
was
evidence
that
there
is
slightly
amusing
kind
that
in
one
state
more
people
voted
than
appeared
on
the
registration
figures
and
you
have
that
kind
of
a
problem.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
believe
that's
correct.
so
it
was
only
registration
is
directly
affected.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
i
think
you
could
be
challenged
for
being
improperly
registered.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
registration
in
this
kind
of
challenge
could
be
made,
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no
additional
literacy
test.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
the
point
that
i
think
is
more
refined
and
i
would
concede
it,
a
more
refined
figure
would
have
been
people
registered
if
you
hadn't
had
the
difficulty
from
establishing
that
figure
beyond
doubt.
so
what
congress
did
in
this
instance
was
take
a
double
inference.
it's
clearly
a
relationship
between
registrations
in
voting.
if
you're
not
registered
you
can't
vote.
so
that
if
a
low
number
of
people
is
registered,
the
chances
are
there
will
be
a
lower
figure
of
voting.
if
you
only
have
60%
of
the
people
registered,
it's
clear
not
more
than
60%
can
or
only
should
be
able
to
vote.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
work
the
other
way.
so
they
took
that
figure
but
they
didn't
consider
that
figure
in
an
abstract
because
they
found
out
that
as
i
indicated
of
the
21
states
that
were
using
literacy
states
--
tests,
six
of
them
were
located
in
areas
where
generally
discrimination
against
negroes
in
various
respects
that
existed
historically
enough
to
the
present
day.
those
facts
were
before
congress
and
when
you
asked
where
there's
evidence
of
discrimination
in
voting
there
is
certainly
evidence
in
those
states
at
least
of
the
possibility
of
discrimination
in
voting
if
you
had
problems
as
virginia's
had
and
south
carolina
has
had
with
respect
to
schools,
with
respect
to
public
accommodations,
with
respect
to
other
matters
over
the
past
years.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
there
was
this
discussion
of
the
primaries
within
those
states
but
as
you
recall
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
1964
election
whatever
might
have
been
true
of
primaries
in
the
past
elections,
in
the
1964
election
there
was
a
good
hot
presidential
raise
in
each
of
those
states.
and
where
it
would
have
been
traditionally
democratic
states
and
traditionally
low
turnout
for
general
election,
if
you
look
at
the
figures,
you'll
find
even
in
the
case
of
south
carolina
higher
turnout
in
the
general
election
and
this
is
true
of
general
elections
in
the
past
and
indeed
true
of
many
primaries.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
would
have
been
higher
and
this
could
have
been
true
of
other
states.
the
figure
of
course
is
taking
it
as
an
arbitrary
figure
for
the
--
taken
for
the
purpose
here
of
--
of
simply
setting
a
trigger
which
can
be
lately
looked
at,
i
mean,
subsequently
looked
at.
you
could
change
the
figure,
it
could
have
been
48
or
52
or
some
other
figure,
they
took
50%
and
they
put
it
together
with
a
good
deal
of
the
other
evidence
that
they
had.
the
issue,
that
mistaken
issue
to
concentrate
on
whether
or
not
50%
is
better
than
51%
or
52%
or
any
other
figure
of
this
kind.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
50%
in
that
election
was
well
below
the
national
average.
i
think
if
you
consider
what
congress
was
using
before
the
congress
was
using
this
for
the
purpose
simply
of
having
an
automatic
test
for
initial
determination
of
where
these
tests
were
suspended
providing
for
a
more
refined
judicial
inquiry
so
that
the
state
could
come
in
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
i
mean
any
kind
of
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
the
point
--
the
point
that
i
was
making
earlier,
i
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
was
if
with
all
the
lawsuits
we
brought
in
mississippi,
alabama
and
louisiana,
if
congress
had
adopted
this
50%
formula
then
looked
at
it
and
found
those
three
states
were
included
within
the
formula,
i
think
they
would
have
looked
for
a
more
rational
formula.
i
see
nothing
wrong
in
congress
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
or
may
have
taken
entirely
a
different
proposition
as
indeed
the
senate
had
the
third
clause
in
there
with
respect
to
a
large
negro
population
which
is
--
which
was
true.
they
also
examined
--
which
was
true
in
all
of
these
states
when
they
saw
what
state
it
was
likely
all
probability
would
apply
to.
all
of
these
--
six
of
these
seven
states
had
--
had
a
history
segregated
schools,
segregated
education
other
forms
of
discrimination
against
the
negroes.
they
all
had
a
history
of
--
i'll
say
all
of
the
--
the
six
of
the
seven
had
a
history
of
white
supremacy
in
voting,
the
history
of
attempts
to
maintain
it
down
through
the
years.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
was
considered
by
congress
and
i
think
they
--
the
congress
came
to
the
conclusion
that
while
indeed
that
might
be
true
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
fairness
of
the
years
selected
mr.
justice
clark
was
that
it
was
far
less
true
in
this
year
than
in
--
than
in
any
other
year.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
they
considered
that.
it
was
after
all
merely
as
an
effort
to
achieve
something
that
was
fair,
that
was
applied
on
an
objective
basis
and
i
think
the
inference
is
hard
to
say
that
it's
an
irrational
inference.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
these
questions
were
raised
repeatedly
in
the
discussions
in
the
congress.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
say
that
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
congress
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
congress
said
it
this
way.
it's
said
it
this
way
with
a
good
deal
of
other
evidence
and
knowing
where
this
was
likely
to
apply
as
a
device
to
bring
in
to
operation
those
provisions
pending
a
judicial
hearing
and
i
think
that
all
this
court
has
to
say
is
that
taken
as
a
whole
on
this
that
it
was
appropriate
legislation
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
taken
as
a
whole
whatever
you
might
feel
about
this
piece
of
evidence
or
that
piece
of
evidence
or
this
inference
or
that
inference
and
taken
as
a
whole,
the
congress
exercise
powers
within
it's
rights,
within
the
broad
discretion
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
--
i
would
think
not
unless
the
basis
for
--
as
i
indicated
earlier
the
basis
for
naming
those
states
was
solely
irrational
that
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
think
that
that
was
possible
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
emphasize
all
of
the
other
evidence
that
was
before
the
congress
and
that
they
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing
when
they
applied
these
tests.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
but
i
think
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
he
gave
these
figures
i
think
of
those
registered.
i
think
that's
his
percentage
figures
because
you
can't
get
to
a
figure
of
a
total
of
66%
in
louisiana
registered
to
an
80%
participation
and
we
thought
merely
we
can't
--[laughter]
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
66%
registered
in
louisiana
and
as
i
--
i
think
and
he
understated
that
figure
in
the
point
of
fact
and
the
difference
between
the
registration,
whites
and
negroes
and
louisiana
is
over
twice
as
many
eligible
whites
to
eligible
negroes
and
it's
a
count
of
four
in
louisiana
as
the
record
bears
out
by
the
fact
that
part
of
that
state,
there
has
been
very
little
discrimination
and
in
part
of
that
state,
there
has
been
a
good
deal
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
with
the
discrimination
of
these
courts
aware
from
louisiana
case.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
believe
those
figures
maybe
in
the
hearing
since
the
number
of
table
--
i'm
not
sure
of
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
there's
a
very
light
primary
turnout
1964
in
south
carolina.
i
believe
that
--
i
think
that
was
stated
by
the
counsel.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
i
believe
every
--
yes,
every
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
its
repeated
statements
of
no
discrimination
that
are
made.
there's
not
--
this
is
sort
of
--
in
the
record,
it's
sort
of
an
evidence
of
the
law
enforcement
officials
saying
there
are
no
complaints
that
have
been
made
to
them.
so
the
different
statistics
was
commonly
testified
to
as
resulting
from
apathy
on
the
part
of
negro
voters
and
that
was
the
reason
for
potential
negro
voters
and
that
was
primarily
the
reason
why
they
weren't
more
negroes
registered.
there's
also
a
good
deal
in
the
way
the
statistics
on
education
which
was
showed
at
a
higher
rate
of
illiteracy
among
negroes
--
less
literacy
among
negroes
than
among
whites
but
the
--
apart
from
general
statements
of
that
kind
and
i
would
like
to
be
clear
with
this
court,
mr.
justice
harlan,
obviously,
there
are
degrees
of
difference.
there
are
degrees
of
difference
between
states
in
the
south,
there
are
degrees
of
difference
between
southern
states,
northern
states,
discrimination
as
you
indicate
exist
in
many
places.
i
have
no
question
on
the
record
of
the
feeling
that
mississippi,
alabama,
and
louisiana
based
on
suit
after
suit
after
suit
within
those
states
wherein
a
different
category
is
reflected
in
the
legislation
than
states
like
virginia
and
south
carolina
where
a
discrimination
if
any
with
respect
to
voting
was
considerably
less.
the
congress
felt
that
the
basis
was
triggered
and
the
other
evidence
that
there
was
a
sufficient
danger
that
these
tests
and
devices
were
being
used
even
in
south
carolina,
virginia,
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
against
negroes
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
for
that
reason
provided
for
a
more
refined
judicial
inquiry
to
find
out
whether
or
not
this
was
in
fact
true
with
suspension
of
the
test
in
the
interim.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
simple
method
of
a
time
to
identify
what
they
thought
the
real
danger
spots
were
and
then
taking
action
with
respect
to
them
and
indeed
repeatedly
stated
in
congress
that
the
fact
that
they
fell
within
this
trigger
did
not
mean
that
they
had
in
fact
been
discriminated
in
voting
but
merely
that
there
was
a
danger
of
it.
it
wasn't
making
a
judgment
about
that
instead,
there
are
enough
factors
involved
there
to
warrant
our
closer
examination
of
whether
or
not
these
has
split
or
not
--
these
tests
and
devices
are
being
used
for
that
purpose
and
for
that
reason
it
set
up
the
procedure
requiring
state
of
the
subdivision
separately
affected
by
the
act
to
come
into
the
district
of
columbia
to
three-judge
court.
and
if
in
fact
discrimination
was
not
existing
on
a
widespread
basis,
it's
just
sporadic,
small
incidence
of
it
that
they
could
by
the
judgment
of
that
court
be
relieved
of
the
suspension
of
tests
and
devices.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
are
virtually
automatic.
i
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
fact
the
attorney
general
of
the
same
(voice
overlap)
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
believe
that
could
be
true
and
i
believe
that
these
provisions
were
intended
simply
to
mitigate
rather
than
aggravate
any
supposed
harshness
in
the
--
in
the
test
that
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
in
--
and
i
think
it's
exercised
it
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
only
question
between
the
temporary
and
permanent
is
if
whether
and
i
think
the
court
would
be
differential
to
congress
and
i
think
to
question
is
whether
or
not
it's
necessary
to
abolish
them
for
all
time
or
whether
it's
necessary
to
allow
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
i
think
they
have
the
--
i
think
they
do
have
the
power
to
suspend
or
to
abolish
these
tests.
i
think
in
this
--
and
that's
exactly
the
power
that
they
exercised
within
this
act.
now,
they
chose
to
exercise
it
within
those
areas
where
they
believed
the
congress
made
the
judgment,
there
was
a
higher
act
--
actual
abuse
or
higher
possibility
of
abuse,
and
then
they
put
in,
and
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
black
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
put
it
in,
but
they
put
in
a
provision
permitted
a
state
to
say
we've
been
fairly
administering
these
law
in
the
past.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
it
would
be
more
difficult
case
mr.
justice
harlan
because
i
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
that
differs
congress
to
make
the
judgment
that
this
is
necessary
for
all
time
would
seem
to
me
a
more
difficult
judgment
to
make
and
to
say
that
this
is
necessary
for
a
period
of
years.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
want
to
simply
cover
a
couple
of
points
rather
briefly.
in
my
judgment,
section
5
as
it
was
discussed
here
in
the
view
of
the
government,
if
it's
legitimate
for
congress
to
suspend
the
operation
of
tests
and
devices
under
section
4,
those
which
presently
exist
than
it
would
seem
to
me
to
follow
from
that,
that
congress
could
take
any
such
similar
laws
or
laws
affecting
the
same
situation
and
suspend
those
absence
on
form
of
judicial
or
executive
approval,
executive
approval
which
resort
to
the
judiciary
or
judicial
approval.
i
think
it's
particularly
true
if
you
look
to
the
history
of
the
efforts
in
some
states
as
soon
as
you
deal
with
an
existing
law
to
enact
a
new
law
which
makes
it
more
difficult
to
enforce.
i
think
to
say
that
congress
has
one
power
without
the
other
is
to
deny
that
they
really
have
a
power
to
enforce
the
scheme
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i
think
the
procedures
that
require
people
to
come
in
to
the
district
of
columbia
states
subdivisions
are
reasonable.
they
have
judicial
precedent
for
requiring
people
to
come
in
not
merely
the
emergency
court
of
appeals,
but
until
very
recently
it
was
the
common
practice
in
suits
against
government
officers
and
agencies
which
for
reasons
venue
always
had
to
be
filed
in
the
district
of
columbia
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
nothing
particularly
unusual
or
horrendous
in
this.
there
has
been
discussions
saying
about
a
hundred
mile
subpoena.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
subpoena
power
apart
from
the
facts
you're
dealing
here
with
state
officials
and
one
might
think
would
testify
freely
the
subpoena
power
can
run
beyond
the
100
miles
with
the
--
with
the
approval
of
the
court.
as
far
as
the
proof,
non-discrimination
is
concerned,
there's
a
testimony
in
the
record
for
congress
that
really
this
isn't
a
difficult
proof
because
what
happens
is
you
simply
come
in,
you
get
testimony
or
depositions,
state
officials
saying
there
have
been
no
complaints,
no
discrimination.
and
then
incumbent
upon
the
attorney
general
to
go
back
in
and
show
that
there
has
been
voting
discrimination
and
to
produce
that
evidence.
absent
to
that
and
absence
to
his
production
of
that
evidence,
the
state
would
clearly
prevail.
so
that
it
is
not
carrying
a
heavy
negative
burden
of
proof.
the
point
of
the
fact,
the
proof
really
would
be
upon
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i'm
talking
here
about
section
4
(d)
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i'm
not
going
to
devote
time
to
5,
mr.
justice
white,
unless
you
have
questions.
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
you
have
the
power
to
suspend
the
existing
test
you
--
congress
has
the
power
to
cope
with
future
legislation
which
might
affect
the
scheme
and
resolution
that
it
has
here
and
as
a
practical
matter
it's
impossible
to
make
a
definition
of
a
law,
broad
terms,
which
--
and
the
state
--
what
its
impact
is
going
to
be
by
some
definitional
process
because
then
when
the
new
law
is
enacted,
it
goes
then
through
the
process
of
long
--
pieces
of
long
time
of
litigation.
so
here,
they
said
the
new
law
--
you
can't
say
you
can't
enact
the
law
incidentally.
it's
just
you
can't
enforce
provisions
of
a
new
law
until
such
time
is
in
effect
the
attorney
general
has
entered
a
consent
judgment
on
it
or
you've
gone
into
court
and
it
indicates
that
it's
not
done
with
the
purpose
or
effect
of
violation
of
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
that
piece
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
they
got
the
burden,
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
they're
just
as
--
anybody
who
is
under
in
a
special
category
and
it
seeks
to
be
exempted
from
it,
carries
the
burden
and
i
conclude
my
argument
that
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes
sir.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
south
carolina
has
urged
it
because
it
extended
for
one
hour
its
voting
laws,
something
which
they
have
not
inquired
with
the
attorney
general
about
which
he
would
be
happy
to
offer
us.
i
don't
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
mississippi
has
a
new
law
which
sets
minimum
standards
of
literacy.
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
section
5
so
interrelated
to
what
i
described
as
the
heart
and
core
scheme
of
the
statute
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
decide
the
issues
under
section
4
without
making
reference
in
deciding
the
questions
under
section
5
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
there's
a
separability
clause.
i
would
suppose
that
as
i've
stated
that
it's
very
difficult
for
me
mr.
justice
black
to
conceive
of
the
argument
would
invalidate
section
5
would
not
also
invalidate
section
4.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
then
that
would
be
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
would
not
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
say
that
enforcement
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
would
be
very
much
more
difficult.
