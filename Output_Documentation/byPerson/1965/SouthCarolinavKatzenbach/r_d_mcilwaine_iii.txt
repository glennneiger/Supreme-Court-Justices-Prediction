mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
virginia,
i
appear
as
one
of
the
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
positions
taken
by
the
state
of
south
carolina
in
the
case
at
bar.
specifically,
the
commonwealth
endorsed
these
two
of
the
positions
taken
by
the
state
of
south
carolina.
first,
the
invalidity
of
the
50%
formula
provisions
which
governed
the
applicability
of
the
act;
and
secondly,
the
invalidity
of
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act
which
abolished
even
racially
nondiscriminatory
literacy
tests
in
the
various
states
covered
by
the
act.
now,
various
aspects
of
south
carolina's
position
had
been
endorsed
by
different
counsel
from
different
other
states
which
have
supported
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
at
bar.
and
then
an
effort
to
prevent
duplication
of
argument,
we
have
undertaken
to
apportion
certain
of
the
aspects
of
south
carolina's
position
for
different
emphasis
by
different
counsel.
it
is
to
the
second
contention
of
south
carolina
which
we
support
that
i
withdraw
the
court's
attention
in
this
case.
particularly
to
what
we
believed
to
be
the
central
and
controlling
issue
in
the
case
at
bar,
namely,
the
scope
of
the
power
conferred
upon
congress
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
indicated
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
framing
and
the
adoption
of
that
amendment.
in
this
connection,
counsel
for
virginia
take
the
position
that
any
impartial
analysis
of
that
legislative
history
will
demonstrate
beyond
(inuadible)
that
no
power
was
conferred
upon
congress
by
that
amendment
to
alter,
amend,
suspend
or
abolish
the
literacy
test
requirement
of
any
state
or
any
other
educational
qualification
placed
upon
the
right
to
vote
by
any
state.
and
also,
that
the
framers
of
that
amendment
on
three
separate
occasions
by
recorded
vote
specifically
rejected
attempts
to
insert
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
just
such
a
power.
as
a
result,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
constitutes
in
our
view
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
by
congress
to
assert
by
legislation
a
power
which
was
specifically
denied
in
the
constitutional
amendment.
as
approval
to
a
consideration
of
this
contention,
we
should
like
to
note
the
government's
concurrence
in
at
least
one
aspect
of
our
position
and
our
concurrence
in
one
aspect
of
the
government's
position.
this
is
embodied
in
two
sentences.
the
opening
two
sentences
of
the
government's
brief
in
its
initial
argument
on
page
26.
the
government
says
this,
“in
enacting
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
congress
was
unmistakably
invoking
its
powers
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
whether
it
exceeded
those
powers
and
invaded
rights
reserved
to
the
states
as
south
carolina
contends,
must
be
determined
from
an
analysis
of
the
scope
of
a
grant
and
the
nature
of
the
reservation.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
so
far
as
we
understand
it
your
honor,
if
the
law
did
not
apply
equally
to
all
what
was
tagged
to
race,
just
like
a
grandfather
clause
to
perpetuate
a
condition.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
which
existed
prior
to
the
induction
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
then
congress
could
--
if
not
abolish
it,
could
at
least
make
it
apply
to
all
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
not
so
far
as
the
literacy
test
is
concerned.
we
would
take
the
position,
your
honor
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
sir,
we
should
take
the
position
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
in
and
of
itself
just
as
the
grandfather
clause
in
the
guinn
case
would
abolish
that
statute,
would
render
that
statute
in
effective.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
consequently
there
would
be
no
need
for
congress
to
enact
any
law.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
do
not
think
they
could
make
it
a
crime
your
honor,
under
the
second
section
for
a
legislature
of
any
state
to
enact
a
statute.
if
the
statute
offends
a
provision
of
the
constitution
as
the
statute
that
you
suggest
would
offend
the
fifteenth
amendment
just
as
the
grandfather
clause
cases,
then
the
act
would
have
no
validity.
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
fall
within
the
power
of
congress
to
undertake
by
statute
to
make
that
requirement,
anymore
than
as
i
say
the
grandfather
clause
cases
in
which
the
scope
of
the
amendment
has
been
considered.
that
if
a
law
would
apply
to
make
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
take
the
position
of
the
first
section
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
would
abolish
it
by
its
own
force,
so
appropriately
all
on
the
glory
and
that
congress
could
not
pass
the
statute
making
it
an
offense.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
would
say
under
the
guinn
decision
that
such
statute
applying
only
to
negroes
and
not
to
whites
as
i
understand
your
honor
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
fifteenth
amendment,
yes
your
honor.
it
would
be
exactly
as
it
is.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
as
the
racially
--
key
of
grandfather
clause.
and
it
would
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment
per
se
under
the
scope
of
those
decisions.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
sir.
if
it
is
discriminatory
applied
we
then
reach
an
area
in
which
congress
would
have
power
to
legislate,
to
enforce
the
prohibition
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
and
the
scope
of
its
legislation
would
then
come
under
consideration.
but
if
the
literacy
test
were
fair
on
its
face
and
applied
to
all,
it
would
not
violate
the
provisions
of
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
could
not
be
suspended
under
the
second
section.
so
far
as
the
government's
position
as
we
return
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
sir.
while
we
concur
with
the
department
of
justice,
and
they
with
us
that
the
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case
requires
an
analysis
of
the
scope
of
the
grant
of
power
to
congress
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
this
also
forms
our
point
of
departure.
but
we
then
contend
that
the
first
place
to
look
to
determine
the
scope
of
this
grant
is
to
read
the
46
words
which
comprised
the
fifteenth
amendment
in
its
entirety.
and
thereafter,
the
principal
source
by
which
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
grant
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
framing
and
the
adoption
of
that
amendment.
this
second
point,
the
justice
department
passes
by
without
comment
or
counterargument
in
their
brief.
now,
we
take
it
as
fundamental
that
this
court's
duty
is
to
construe,
not
to
rewrite
or
to
amend
the
constitution
as
was
stated
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
bell
against
maryland,
a
proposition
concurred
in
by
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinion.
and
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
said
on
that
occasion
and
we
used
this
expression
of
it
simply
because
it
is
recent
and
because
we
think
it
forcefully
puts
the
proposition
for
which
we
contend,
our
sworn
duty
to
construe
the
constitution
requires
however
that
we
read
it
to
effectuate
the
intent
and
purposes
of
the
framers.
we
must
therefore
consider
the
history
and
circumstances
indicating
what
the
civil
war
amendments
were
in
fact
designed
to
achieve.
now,
this,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
had
done,
and
it
has
included
that
history
in
an
appendix
to
its
brief.
we
take
the
position
that
this
legislative
history
shows
as
clearly
as
anything
can
be
that
the
scope
of
the
authority
conferred
upon
congress
was
the
power
to
prohibit
discrimination
on
account
of
race,
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
and
left
absolutely
unaffected
the
power
of
the
states
to
prescribe
any
of
the
qualification
upon
the
right
to
vote,
specifically,
it
left
untouched
the
power
of
states
to
proscribe
literacy
and
educational
tests
upon
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
the
suggestion
that
was
made,
your
honor.
that
it
would
disfranchise
sometimes,
somebody
said
50%,
some
said
99%.
but
that
if
it
was
done,
it
would
constitute
no
violation
of
either
the
letter
or
the
spirit
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
this
is
exactly
the
point
that
was
made
by
those
who
objected
to
the
limited
language
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
originated
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
originated
as
a
proposal
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
and
as
you
issued
forth
from
that
committee,
it
was
substantially
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
now
reads.
objection
was
made
to
it,
on
this
ground
by
mr.
shellabarger
of
ohio
and
by
mr.
bingham
of
ohio.
and
i
submit
that
when
we
reached
congressman
bingham,
we
have
reached
a
source
that
is
entitled
to
great
consideration
for
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
adamson
case,
mr.
justice
black
characterized
congressman
bingham
as
the
matters
of
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
he
was
in
congress
at
all
times
during
the
debate
on
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
he
pointed
out
as
clearly
as
could
be
that
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
proposed
by
the
house
judiciary
committee,
it
would
be
perfectly
competent
for
the
states
to
disfranchise
any
and
all
classes
of
citizens
they
may
wish
to
do
so
provided
they
did
so
with
a
literacy
test
or
a
property
qualification
applicable
to
all.
on
this
point,
mr.
bingham
said
and
we
have
set
it
out
on
page
4
of
our
appendix,
these
three
items,
race,
color
and
previous
condition
of
servitude
are
the
only
terms
of
limitation
in
it.
and
hence
it
is
manifestly
true
that
this
power
remaining
in
the
states
in
no
other
manner
fettered
by
the
proposed
amendment
may
be
exercised
to
the
end
that
an
aristocracy
of
property
may
be
established
and
aristocracy
of
intellect
may
be
established.
this
language
echoed
that
of
mr.
shellabarger
from
ohio
who
said
that
under
it,
it
leads
the
discriminations
of
the
states
and
that
these
discriminations
may
be
made
on
the
score
of
either
intelligence
or
want
of
property
or
any
other
thing
than
the
three
things
enumerated
in
the
proposition.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
am
not
aware
of
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
not
deny
that
it
may
have
been,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
this
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
without
knowing
specifically
about
the
existence
of
the
laws
to
which
you
refer
because
those
who
objected
to
the
limited
form
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
pointed
out
that
for
years,
both
southern
and
northern
states
had
deprived
the
negro
of
education,
had
robbed
him
of
his
property
and
that
therefore,
he
had
been
reduced
to
this
condition
and
yet
he
could
still
be
disfranchised
for
want
of
education,
want
of
literacy
and
want
of
property
even
though
his
status
in
both
northern
and
southern
states
was
due
to
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
treated
for
two
centuries
in
this
country,
yet
he
could
still
be
disfranchised
by
a
literacy
test.
and
senator
charles
sumner
of
massachusetts
said,
in
effect,
this
makes
no
difference
if
the
qualification,
education,
literacy
or
property
is
one
which
is
attainable,
if
it
is
within
the
reach
of
a
well-directed
effort
by
colored
citizens
or
by
orientals
who
were
the
chief
concern
of
the
senators
from
the
west
coast,
then
it
is
a
proper
qualification.
and
despite
the
fact,
that
the
condition
of
the
negro
in
this
country
had
been
brought
about
as
the
radical
republican
said
by
the
activities
of
the
white
citizen
both
in
the
north
and
the
south,
yet
under
this
limited
amendment
they
could
be
disfranchised
by
a
literacy
test
which
applied
equally
to
all.
and
that
was
the
purpose
or
the
specific
ground
of
their
opposition
to
the
limited
fifteenth
amendment,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
proposed
instead,
both
mr.
bingham
and
mr.
shellabarger,
the
universal
manhood
suffrage
proposition,
which
would
have
said
that
no
state
should
deny
to
any
male
citizen,
21
years
of
age
or
upward
and
of
sound
mind,
the
right
to
vote
if
he
has
resided
in
the
state
for
one
year
under
mr.
bingham's
proposal,
under
mr.
shellabarger's
proposal
if
he
has
resided
in
the
state
for
the
length
of
time
prescribed
by
state
law.
now
these
propositions
were
voted
down
by
more
than
two
to
one
vote
in
the
house.
and
the
proposition
to
insert
in
the
fifteenth
amendment,
in
addition
to
race,
color
and
previous
condition
of
servitude,
property
and
education
was
also
voted
down.
and
thereafter,
the
house
passed
the
fifteenth
amendment
in
the
form
in
which
we
now
find
it.
if
they
--
and
the
senate
opened
on
this
resolution
as
settled
from
the
house,
and
once
again,
objection
was
made
to
it
and
it
was
castigated
on
all
side
by
those
who
said,
under
it
--
the
southern
states
as
well
as
the
northern
states
may
disfranchise
any
people
they
wish,
any
class
of
people,
by
use
of
a
property
qualification
or
an
educational
qualification
so
far
--
so
long
as
it
applies
equally
to
all
who
make
application
to
vote.
mr.
warner
and
mr.
morton,
or
senator
warner
and
senator
morton,
both
republicans,
made
the
same
type
of
statements
that
mr.
bingham,
congressman
bingham
and
congressman
shellabarger
had
made
in
the
house.
mr.
warner's
statement
is
especially
forceful.
it
set
on
page
8
of
the
appendix,
it
is
to
this
effect.
the
animus
of
this
amendment
is
a
desire
to
protect
and
enfranchise
the
colored
citizens
of
the
country.
yet,
under
it
and
without
any
violation
of
its
letter
or
spirit,
nine-tenths
of
them
might
be
prevented
from
voting
and
holding
office
by
the
requirement
on
the
part
of
the
states
or
of
the
united
states
of
an
intelligence
or
property
qualification.
the
objection
to
the
limited
amendment
was
that
it
would
not
protect
anyone
from
the
requirement
of
a
state
prescribed
literacy
test,
property
test,
nativity
test,
religious
test
or
any
other
test,
so
long
as
it
was
not
race,
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude.
this
limited
scope
of
the
amendment
so
angered
senator
wilson
of
massachusetts
that
he
proposed
an
amendment
which
would
have
added
to
the
specific
grounds
banned
by
the
fifteenth
amendment,
not
only
race,
color
and
previous
condition
of
servitude
but
also
nativity,
property,
education
and
creed.
he
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
house
version
which
would
have
added
these
four
specific
realms
as
grounds
upon
which
a
state
might
not
disfranchise
its
citizens.
this
proposition
actually
carried
in
the
senate
and
that
version
in
which
--
which
would
have
authorized
congress
to
pass
legislation
enforcing
a
ban
against
literacy
and
educational
qualifications
was
sent
from
the
senate
to
the
house.
the
house
by
a
lopsided
vote
of
a
133
to
37
refused
to
concur
in
the
senate
amendment
and
called
for
a
conference
committee.
the
senate
would
have
no
part
of
a
conference
committee
because
of
the
objections
stated
by
senator
buckalew
of
pennsylvania
who
warn
the
senate
that
in
these
matters,
the
house
of
representatives
always
insist
that
its
particular
view
shall
prevail
and
in
nine-tenths
of
the
cases
they
have
their
way.
if
we
send
this
to
a
conference
committee,
what
we're
going
to
get
back
is
the
limited
house
version
and
not
the
version
as
amended
by
the
wilson
amendment.
as
a
result,
they
refused
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir,
if
they
apply
equally
to
all
citizens.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
most
valid
evidence
in
the
world
mr.
chief
justice,
because
it
abolishes
virginia's
literacy
test
which
simply
requires
people
to
fill
out
a
form
to
vote.
it
is
the
most
nondiscriminatory
literacy
test
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
even
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
sir.
i
think
that
when
you
have
a
statute
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
says,
in
any
state,
virginia
or
any
other
state
that
a
state
statute
which
says
in
order
to
be
able
to
vote,
a
person
must
fill
out
an
application
form
in
his
own
handwriting.
that
congress
has
no
power
whatever
under
any
circumstances,
whatever
to
abolish
that
test,
because
that
is
an
education
test,
it
is
not
within
the
authority
of
congress
to
abolish
or
suspend
it
or
order
it
or
amend
it.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
how
discriminatorily
it
may
be
applied,
yes
your
honor.
the
statute
is
still
perfectly
good
and
congress
cannot
suspend
it.
now,
if
congress
finds
that
there
has
been
discrimination
in
the
administration,
are
they
perfectly
valid
test?
then
the
congress
may
take
action
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
end
the
discriminatory
application,
but
congress
in
so
doing
does
not
touch
the
qualification
to
vote.
this
is
what
is
reserved
to
the
states.
this
is
what
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
confirms
to
the
states.
in
article
i
section
2
and
in
the
seventeenth
amendment
passed
subsequent
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
qualifications
to
vote
for
members
of
congress
are
the
qualifications
established
by
state
law
and
no
statute
enacted
by
congress
until
now
and
no
statute
which
congress
could
ever
enact
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
can
vary
nondiscriminatory
educational
qualifications.
this
is
the
power
which
it
was
specifically
attempted
to
confer
upon
the
congress.
indeed,
it
was
a
power
which
the
--
a
certain
framers
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
sought
to
write
into
the
amendment
per
se,
so
that
all
literacy
test
would
be
abolished
by
the
sheer
forces
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
all
property
qualifications
abolishment.
but
in
cases
that
from
the
point
of
this
court,
since
then,
particularly
myers
versus
anderson,
a
requirement
that
a
voter
must
own
$500
worth
of
property
was
sustained
by
this
court
and
the
court
said,
it
makes
no
difference
how
this
qualification
applies
in
actual
practice,
that
is
the
percentage
of
people
who
may
or
may
not
be
permitted
to
vote
because
of
the
$500
figure?
the
figure
itself
is
nondiscriminatory
and
it
cannot
be
attacked
on
the
ground
of
the
motive
for
which
it
was
inserted
or
its
practical
operation
in
effect
upon
any
class
of
voters.
it
is
a
power
within
the
scope
of
the
states
under
the
article
i
section
2
in
the
tenth
amendment
and
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
authority
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
has
been
granted
to
congress.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
precisely
my
view,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
where
we've
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
i
think
so.
and
we
start
with
this
proposition
that
out
of
section
2
of
article
xv
says
“congress
shall
have
power
to
enforce
this
article
by
appropriate
legislation.”
it
does
not
have
power
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
it
was
not
adopted.
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
enforce
a
prohibition
against
literacy
test
which
was
not
given
to
them
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
does
not
have
that
power.
this
proposition
which
you
put
sir,
that
congress
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
people
are
being
discriminated
against
because
of
property
qualifications,
and
educational
qualifications,
and
they
operate
upon
one
class
to
exclude
more
of
that
class
than
they
do
of
another,
more
colored
people
than
they
do
white
people,
more
orientals
than
they
do
colored
people,
all
white
people.
this
was
known
to
the
framers
as
being
an
objection
to
the
limited
scope
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
they
understood
that
that
might
happen
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
or
under
the
second
section.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir,
or
that
the
congress
would
had
any
power
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well
this
is
in
the
latter
sections
of
our
history,
mr.
justice
black,
to
which
we
would
refer
you
pages
40
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
page
34
to
45
of
our
brief
during
the
congressional
debates
on
enforcement
legislation
where
it
clearly
appeared
that
congress
would
have
no
power.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
your
honor,
you're
assuming
that
a
literacy
is
discriminatory.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
mean
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
because
of
the
way
--
i
mean,
do
you
not
put
the
proposition
that
congress
finds.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
if
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir.
well
this
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
we
arrive
at
that
proposition
by
this
course,
your
honor.
congress
is
protecting
the
right
to
vote.
protecting
it
against
what?
congress
is
authorized
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
is
the
sole
constitutional
provision
upon
which
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
has
rested.
congress
is
authorized
to
protect
the
vote
from
discrimination
on
account
of
race,
color
or
servitude.
it
is
not
authorized
to
enfranchise
either
negroes
or
orientals
or
illiterates
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
simply
because
it
would
enlarge
the
electorate.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
to
enforce
this
article,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
right,
not
the
right
--
not
to
be
discriminated
against
on
the
grounds
of
illiteracy.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
against
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
race,
your
honor.
if
the
two
things
can
be
brought
together,
and
i
submit
that
there
is
no
possible
way
in
which
a
state
which
applies
a
literacy
test
applicable
to
everyone
which
this
court
unanimously
approved
in
lassiter
against
northampton
county.
and
said,
this
is
a
perfectly
valid
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
see
you've
sustained
it
as
not
being
valid
with
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendments,
so
that
--
we
do
not
have
discrimination
by
virtue
of
a
literacy
test.
a
literacy
test
only
discriminates
against
the
illiterate,
if
it
is
applied
to
all.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
if
at
that
time
the
framers
adopted
the
fifteenth
amendment
your
honor,
they
foresaw
this
possibility
that
congress
would
have
or
would
not
have
power
under
the
second
section
to
abolish
state
literacy
test
and
deny
that
that
power
was
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
cannot
at
this
date
write
it
into
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
a
matter
of
interpretation.
to
do
that,
it
would
in
effect
supply
the
missing
votes
for
the
bingham
and
wilson
proposals.
and
it
would
give
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
section
2
authorizes
congress
--
if
your
honor
please
to
pass
anyone
of
a
number
of
laws
to
provide
for
the
fair
administration
of
state
prescribed
qualifications
to
prescribe
all
sorts
of
investigations
which
have
been
undertaken
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
make
it
an
offense
for
any
person
to
deny
a
person
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
his
race
or
color.
the
numerable
collateral
things
which
the
congress
can
do
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
but
it
cannot
reach
state
prescribed
literacy
qualifications.
it
cannot
alter
those
qualifications
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
all
that
congress
can
do
in
that
case
your
honor
as
we
submit
in
our
brief
is
to
provide
for
the
even-handed
application
of
the
nondiscriminatory
criteria.
it
cannot
suspend
the
criteria.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
what
we
believed
to
be
the
simplest
possible
method
of
doing
it
and
the
most
effective.
and
that
the
statute
of
applicable
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
united
states
that
whenever
in
any
political
subdivision
anyone
alleges
in
the
federal
district
court
that
he's
been
denied
the
right
to
register
and
vote
on
account
of
his
race
or
color,
the
district
court
shall
hear
the
case,
make
a
finding,
if
he
finds
that
there
has
been
discrimination,
he
can
appoint
an
examiner
and
the
examiner
can
sit
and
be
administer
the
state
prescribed
qualifications
under
the
office
of
the
district
court
and
register
anybody
he
wants
to.
that's
the
way
to
protect
it,
that's
even-handed
application
of
state
prescribed
qualifications
which
within
the
scope
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
leaves
the
reserve
filed
to
the
states
on
attachment.
thank
you
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
chief
justice.
