justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
question
i
want
to
put
to
you,
suppose
that
congress
had
go
with
it
directly
and
say
on
the
basis
of
our
investigation
we
find
that
in
the
states
of
the
union,
there
has
been
racial
discrimination
brought
about
and
imparted
by
the
use
of
literacy
test
and
we
find
that
that
exist
in
named
states,
nine
named
states.

would
be
the
constitutional
objection

justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
suppose
that
they
are
named
states.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
this
isn't
a
penalty,
this
is
a
question
of
ensuring
by
congressional
legislation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
possessed
future
legislation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
question
i
just
put
in
you,
why?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions.
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
georgia
law
was
deactivated
so
to
speak,

deprived
against
the
literacy
test
after

i'm
saying
is
that
the
man
is
qualified
for
registration.
was
there
a
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
second
question
i
want
to
ask
you
is
the
legislative
record
[inaudible]
is
there

evidence
before

justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
the
--
you
decide

realize
that

this
case
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
a
more
concrete
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
more
or
less
under
the
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
constitutional
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
could
run
through
the
legislative
history
[inaudible]
that
their
version
of
it
is
correct,
the
question
that
my
brother
stewart
is
putting
to
you,
i
should
think
would
be
right
in
front
that
legislative
history
of
the

justice
john
m.
harlan

generalizations
are
of
course
submitted
[inaudible]
section

that
not
withstanding
potential
risk
for
discrimination
in
the
states
for
free
really
depends.
that's
their
argument
and
then
therefore
when
you
talk
about
appropriate
you
have
to
deal
with
appropriate
in
terms
of
what
the
passage
of
that
evidence,
the
debates
which
is
subsequently
