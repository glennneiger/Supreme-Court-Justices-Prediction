justice
potter
stewart
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
theory
--
maybe
it's
just
a
matter
of
words,
but
isn't
the
theory
that
the
combination
of
the
literacy
test
and
the
local
as
evidenced
not
that
they
may
be
abused
but
that
they
have
been
abused.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
how's
the
test
administered?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
i
mean
to
say
is
can
a
person
simply
sign
an
affidavit,
i
know
how
to
read
and
write?
justice
potter
stewart
they
just
fixed
it
up
and
read
it
aloud?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
latter
shows
his
ability
to
write.
justice
potter
stewart
or
it's
--
thus,
the
test
was
suspended
nevertheless.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
think
that
a
court
then
could
enjoin
the
use
of
a
literacy
test
for
any
period
of
time.
justice
potter
stewart
any
--
what's
the
percentage
of
registered
voters
among
the
adult
population
of
south
carolina?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
of
those
--
i
want
to
be
sure
we
understand
each
other,
all
that
56%,
all
of
those
people
were
freely
illegible
to
vote
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
out
of
their
own
choice.
justice
potter
stewart
no
further
poll
taxes
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
qualifications
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
discriminating
on
registration.
justice
potter
stewart
because
disqualified
registered
people
didn't
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
deal
with
the
50%
registrants.
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
others
have
more
than
50%
registered
voters
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
fewer
than
50%
voter
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
said
there
were
four
states
which
were
what?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
not
covered
but
which
were
what?
justice
potter
stewart
which
states
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
those
percentages
are
registration.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
percentage
of
illiteracy
in
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
say
it
was
20%
of
the
adult
population?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
potential
voting
population?
justice
potter
stewart
that'll
point
--
yes,
he's
been
rather
out
to
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
was
this
part
of
your
argument,
the
--
this
appeared
instead
of
november
1st,
1964,
in
the
presidential
election
of
1964,
congress
had
said
november
1st
of
any
--
even
numbered
here
or
there
are
any
presidential
election.
justice
potter
stewart
that
your
--
this
part
of
your
argument
goes
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
this
part
of
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
that
you
--
what
shows
what?
justice
potter
stewart
or
on
november
1st
of
any
even
number
here.
justice
potter
stewart
supposed
mr.
mcilwaine
it
was
clear
and
as
i
gathered
from
scanning
your
appendix
before
this
argument,
it
was
made
clear
that
if
the
former
slave
states
had
put
in
literacy
test
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
ratification
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
write
--
and
thereafter
--
immediately
thereafter,
the
very
fairest
kind
of
an
application
of
such
literacy
test
would
probably
have
effectively
disenfranchise
to
something
like
95%
or
98%
of
the
negro
potential
voters,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
go
ahead,
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
that
point.
you've
told
us
that
as
the
act
indeed
explicitly
provide
that
there
is
no
review
whatsoever
of
the
certification
of
finding
by
the
director
of
the
census
or
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
--
why
do
you
first
have
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
that
before
you
can
invoke
the
other
(voice
overlap)
of
section
4?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
cer
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
--
they'll
certainly
be
entitled
to
make
that
claim.
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
didn't
understand
why
he'd
be
required
to
make
that
claim
in
order
to
get
to
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
question
about
the
percentage
of
your
registered
voters
among
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that
percentage
around?
50?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
an
issue,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
voting
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
voting
age
in
georgia
is
18?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
from
the
argument
yesterday
that
there
was
no
such
evidence
in
the
current
contemporary
virginia.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
find
a
rationale
basis
for
--
if
you're
right
in
the
answer
to
my
brother
harlan's
question
that
there
would
be
constitutional
difficulties
about
picking
out
one
or
more
states
and
excluding
others
where
the
problem
exists,
you
can
find
a
rational
basis
for
the
exclusion
of
northern
florida
and
arkansas
and
texas,
can
you?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
really
it's
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you've
just
told
us
a
little
earlier
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
contemporary
abuse
of
this
device
in
the
state
of
virginia.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
that
beginning
for
a
moment
the
constitutional
questions
it's
just
a
matter
of
information
as
to
how
this
law
works
that
it's
provisions
require
that
in
these
states
which
have
been
certified
to
meet
these
--
in
which
these
triggers
have
an
impact,
hereafter,
the
state
registrars
are
required
to
register
people
who
are
illiterate
and
who
are
of
bad
moral
character
that
is
they're
not
required
to
prove
that
the
applicant
is
either
illiterate
or
of
good
moral
character
and
thereafter
there
can't
be
any
challenge
on
the
--
on
the
basis
that
they
--
on
either
one
of
those
criteria.
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
this
act
there
is
a
requirement
upon
the
state
officials
so
long
as
he's
in
charge
or
upon
your
federal
registrar
if
you
proceed
under
section
6
of
the
act
and
send
federal
people
in
there,
there
is
a
requirement
that
they
register
applicants
who
are
illiterate
and
are
of
bad
moral
character,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
or
good
moral
character.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
an
objective
law?
it
doesn't
say
any
about
a
non-objective
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
really
getting
--
i
think
we
understand
each
other
and
then
there
cannot
be
under
any
subsequent
challenge
on
the
basis
either
of
illiteracy
or
bad
moral
character
objectively
applied
but
without
anything,
without
any
requirements
like
previous
conviction
of
felony.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
may
or
may
not
be
but
that's
a
different
subject.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
there
--
there
cannot
be
any
subsequent
challenge
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
either
one
of
those
statements.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
provision
for
the
challenge?
what's
the
--
what's
the
challenge
then
all
about,
the
challenge
authority
you
found
in
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
10
days
within
which
to
challenge.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
doesn't
made
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
valid
state
requirements
which
haven't
been
suspended
by
this
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general
in
the
--
during
the
process
of
consideration
of
this
act,
during
its
legislative
history
as
we
call
it,
was
any
consideration
given
to
a
simple
act
that
would
provide
that
whenever
the
attorney
general
found
that
literacy
test
or
others
of
these
devices
were
being
unfairly
administered,
he
could
send
in
federal
registrars
to
act
and
to
fairly
administer
the
acts
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
an
alternative.
justice
potter
stewart
uphold
this
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
--
you're
not
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
that,
aren't
you
as
such?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
suggesting
it's
the
only
way
though.
justice
potter
stewart
now
are
you
suggesting
it's
the
best
way,
i
assume
because
i
obviously
--
it
could
be
suggested
that
maybe
the
best
way
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
cure
or
putting
illiterates
on
the
--
on
the
rolls
is
not
to
put
many
more
illiterates
on
the
rolls.
another
way
to
do
it
would
have
been
to
declare
the
whole
thing
null
and
void
and
they
have
a
new
registration
of
everybody
by
federal
registrars
of
wherever
you
found
that
these
things
had
been
abused.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
it
had
the
literacy
rights
in
these
states
in
front
of
it
too.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
its
irrelevant
(voice
overlap)
because
obviously
if
there
were
50%
literacy
rate
the
fairest
application
in
the
world
could
produce
more
than
50%
of
registered
voters.
justice
potter
stewart
the
highest
literacy
--
illiteracy
rate
of
anyone
of
these
states
affected
that.
justice
potter
stewart
23%.
justice
potter
stewart
the
23%
of
the
people
of
voting
age
i
suppose
the
illiteracy
is
a
little
higher
among
older
people
than
in
the
younger
people.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that's
23%
of
the
total
population?
justice
potter
stewart
the
test
maybe
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
statutory
test.
justice
potter
stewart
--
from
the
statutory
test.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
question
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
question
would
be
if
you
had
a
fairly
administrative
literate
--
literacy
test
and
a
vast
proportion
of
the
illiterate
were
negro
people
and
the
reason
they
were
illiterate
people
was
because
the
state
had
denied
on
the
equal
facilities
with
education.
that
would
be
quite
a
different
lawsuit
and
quite
a
different
question
than
the
one
we
had
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
third
objection
that
its
at
least
had
been
voiced
by
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
and
that
is
that
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
doesn't
allow
congress
to
overwrite
other
constitutional
provisions
and
if
there
are
such
other
constitutional
provisions
which
rely
on
the
--
as
obstacles
to
this
particular
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
not
suggesting
are
you
mr.
attorney
general
that
congress
could
say
override
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
just
for
example
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
that
might
be
quite
appropriate
in
the
enforcement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
fourteenth
amendment
point.
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
little
trouble
right
there.
it
was
a
double
test
as
we
both
know
that
50%
of
--
under
50%
of
those
registered
on
november
1st
or
under
the
50%
of
those
who
voted
on
otherwise
november
4th.
literacy
test
has
to
do
only
with
registration
so
far
as
direct
impact
is
concerned,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
wouldn't
the
--
i
can
understand
therefore
the
relevance
and
the
claimed
rationality
of
the
percentage
of
registration,
but
i
have
difficulty
with
the
other
alternative.
indeed,
i
could
understand
it
if
only
the
number
who
voted
were
there,
but
since
they're
both
there,
i
think
it
intensifies
my
problem
because
only
the
one
seems
directly
relevant.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
only
thing
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
how
many
voted.
justice
potter
stewart
its
only
registration
which
is
--
which
is
directly
affected
by
literacy
test,
is
it
not
or
do
i
misunderstand
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you
or
i
asked
that
question
earlier.
in
other
words
once
you
registered,
there
cannot
be
an
additional
challenge
thereafter
when
you
go
to
voting
places,
but
you're
illiterate.
justice
potter
stewart
because
there's
no
additional
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
additional
literacy
test
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
literacy
test
goes
to
your
registration,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
have
to
work
the
other
way
though.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
quite
true
about
the
act.
it
might
have
been
true
about
the
concern
of
congress.
i'm
sure
it
was
but
the
act
directs
itself
to
literacy
test
per
se,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
seven
states.
justice
potter
stewart
was
to
eliminate
the
discrimination
and
the
abuse
which
is
going
on
a
under
this
--
under
these
literacy
tests.
but
the
tests
per
se
are
the
object
of
the
congressional
attack,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
results
--
what
results
from
this
act
of
congress
if
it's
valid
is
the
registration
of
thousands
of
--
hopefully
of
illiterate
people
in
these
states,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
the
purpose,
isn't
that
the
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
ultimately
a
judicial
question
though,
it's
ultimately
a
constitutional
question.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
a
question
for
this
court
to
decide,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
regarding
the
question
particularly
i
mean
is
to
whether
or
not
this
is
appropriate
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
let's
say
--
let's
take
a
case
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
state
of
wyoming
have
a
literacy
test?
justice
potter
stewart
and
let's
assume
that
congress
said
under
our
power,
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
we're
going
to
abolish
all
the
literacy
tests
in
the
state
of
wyoming.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
would
be
or
they
might
synthesize
some
test
that
would
apply
to
wyoming
and
only
wyoming.
then
it
would
certainly
be
a
matter
for
this
court
to
decide
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
an
appropriate
enforcement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
if
they
went
in
and
lost
then
the
five
years
would
start
running
again,
wouldn't
it
or
do
i
misunderstand
--
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
violation
and
not
from
the
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
--
it
just
occurred
to
me
--
