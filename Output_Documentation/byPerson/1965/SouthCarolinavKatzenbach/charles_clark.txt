mr.
charles
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen,
your
honors.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
portion
of
the
assigned
topics
which
concerns
itself
with
the
bill
of
attainder
aspects
or
the
bill
of
pains
and
penalties
aspects
of
this
legislation.
by
calling
to
your
honors
attention
that
the
state
of
south
carolina
is
before
this
court,
not
qua
state
but
as
parens
patriae
of
people,
of
individuals,
of
persons,
just
as
much
individuals,
just
as
much
citizens
as
members
of
the
communist
party.
there's
no
reason
to
make
a
distinction
between
dave
robinson,
a
citizen
of
south
carolina,
who
is
an
individual
here
complaining
about
this
act
and
who
is
in
effect
telling
this
court
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
attempting
to
deal
with
what
it
considered
an
evil
has
in
fact
violated
the
constitution
under
which
it
operates
because
the
constitution
is
over
every
one
of
us.
this
document
says,
no
bill
of
attainder
or
ex
post
facto
law
shall
be
passed.
this
is
a
limitation
on
what
congress
can
do,
no
matter
how
noble
an
undertaking
that
congress
starts
out
to
accomplish.
this
limitation
is
there
on
everything
that
it
does.
the
classic
definition
is
a
legislative
act
which
inflicts
punishment
without
a
judicial
trial
and
every
aspect
of
that
definition
is
satisfied
in
this
case,
every
aspect.
more
simply,
it
is
a
legislative
trial.
if
your
honors
please,
you
will
recall
that
this
time
last
year,
i
stood
before
you
in
a
case,
united
states
versus
mississippi,
in
which
we
were
contending
that
the
government
had
filed
too
broad
a
lawsuit
in
which
we
were
contending
that
the
judicial
power,
judicial
power,
your
honors
please,
did
not
give
mr.
katzenbach
--
attorney
general
katzenbach,
the
right
to
pursue
the
entire
state
of
mississippi
in
one
lawsuit.
and
that
issue
had
never
been
made
before,
this
court
ruled
against
me.
and
we
went
back
to
mississippi
to
try
that
lawsuit
and
i
affirm
my
state,
taken
out
of
the
courts,
the
courts
--
the
forum
that
this
court
had
declared
competent
to
deal
with
the
entire
state
in
one
lawsuit
but
i'm
taken
out
of
that
forum
and
into
the
forum
of
congress
where
no
rights
are
accorded
to
litigants
of
a
judicial
nature
or
according
to
the
state
of
mississippi
and
numerous
aspersions
were
cast
on
that
state
in
the
course
of
the
congressional
hearings.
we
didn't
get
a
judicial
trial.
we
were
forced
to
leave
a
judicial
proceeding
in
the
midst
of
it.
a
proceeding
which
by
the
way
it
has
now
been
recast
as
a
suit
to
enforce
this
act,
a
much
limited
version
of
the
lawsuit
we
were
pursuing
to
see
whether
or
not
in
the
true
test
of
truth,
in
the
test
of
truth
in
a
court
of
law,
the
attorney
general
could
prove
the
things
that
he
claimed
to
congress
were
wrong
with
voting
and
registration
procedures
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
he
even
contends
that
court
ought
not
be
more
ignorant
than
other
man,
and
it's
a
hard
thing
to
say
that
that's
a
bad
rule.
but
it
is
and
the
statute
of
justice
herself
is
blindfolded.
she
knows
nothing
except
what
the
litigants
produced
in
a
courtroom
with
the
true
test
of
trial
procedures
available
to
those
who
are
litigating
about
what
is
true.
and
this
is
what's
wrong
with
the
bill
in
the
sections
attacked
by
south
carolina.
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
entire
act
must
go
out
and
certainly
not
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
it's
not
to
say
that
congress
can't
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
it
is
to
demand
that
that
enforcement
be
appropriate
legislation
and
it
cannot
be
appropriate
if
it
doesn't
square
with
the
document
that
constitution
is
a
continuum.
it's
not
one
thing
here
and
one
thing
there,
if
a
law
does
not
square
with
the
entire
document,
it
can't
be
a
constitutional
law.
and
if
congress
can
right
drop
shot
over
you,
there's
no
need
to
have
this
court.
if
congress
can't
be
called
to
account
for
its
actions
within
the
limited
framework
of
the
constitution,
why
do
you
need
to
sit?to
hear
appeals
from
the
states
apart
court?
that's
not
what
article
iii
established
this
court
for.
it's
established
that's
they
give
you
the
opportunity
to
call
any
department
of
the
government
to
account,
if
it
left
the
bounds
of
a
document
we
all
for
to
uphold
and
support
and
defend.
your
honor
please,
i'm
at
exposing
point,
would
you
--
mr.
charles
clark
oh,
you
want
to
finish
this
afternoon,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
clark
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
with
it.
mr.
charles
clark
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
why
i
emphasized
that
the
litigant
before
you
today,
is
not
the
intangible
state
of
south
carolina.
this
is
a
suit
in
which
jurisdiction
is
only
sustained
because
of
its
parens
patriae
position.
because
of
baker
versus
carr,
in
the
line
of
cases
in
which
you
said,
individuals
have
a
right,
not
to
have
their
vote
diluted.
this
is
a
matter
of
people
claiming
to
this
court
that
their
rights
have
been
infringed,
just
as
much
so
as
in
ancient
england
and
in
revolutionary
america,
when
individuals
complained,
when
legislatures
named
them,
and
this
is
exactly
what
congress
did.
congress
named
these
states.
mr.
charles
clark
i
agree.
mr.
charles
clark
i
don't
know
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
if
your
honor
please,
bill
of
attainder
--
i
hope
to
reach
it
of
course.
mr.
charles
clark
bill
of
attainders
had
been
a
problem
to
this
court
ever
since
they
were
brought
before
you.
there's
never
been
but
one
unanimous
opinion
from
this
court
on
the
bill
of
attainder
question,
and
that
was
in
1889
about
whether
you
could
require
doctor
who
have
a
license
to
practice
medicine.
that's
the
only
time
this
court
has
been
unanimous
on
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
act
is
a
bill
of
attainder
or
not.
and
there
are
two
separate
schools
of
taught,
one
is
the
strict
historical
school
where
you've
got
to
find
an
old
bill
of
attainder
just
exactly
like
what
this
act
does
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
bill
of
attainder
just
to
prevent
it.
that
court
in
brown
took
awhile
the
concept
and
they
said
it's
intended
to
guarantee
in
its
limited
face
the
separation
of
powers
within
our
uniquely
compartmented
government.
but,
you
can
find
attainders
just
exactly
like
this
act.
and
i
--
one
thing
i
do
want
to
say,
it
is
my
contention
that
the
congress
named
the
states.
now,
you
point
out
that
alaska
got
included,
well
of
course
alaska
got
included
because
they
had
a
gift
to
louisiana.
the
attorney
general
would
say,
he
wouldn't
accept
any
test
that
didn't
include
mississippi,
alabama
and
louisiana.
and
their
gift
to
louisiana
with
this
higher
percentage
of
voting,
he
had
to
go
to
50%
in
that
vote
or
less.
but,
it's
no
problem
because
they
can
come
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
get
out.
is
that
--
do
that
keep
it
from
being
a
bill
of
attainder?
not
in
the
historical
definition.
because
most
of
the
old
attainder
acts
provided
john
jones
or
the
earl
of
kellie
is
attained
with
the
proviso
that
he
must
surrender
himself
to
justice
by
a
fixed
date.
mr.
charles
clark
surrender
to
justice
was
all
the
act
said.
submit
himself
to
the
justices
of
the
peace
in
england
and
be
tried.
in
fact,
the
old
irish
attainder
act
that
obtained
over
2000
people
in
the
same
bill
had
a
provision
for
surrender.
of
course
they
did
keep
that
act
in
their
pockets
until
after
the
date
was
passed.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
but
at
the
same
time,
there
were
in
a
number
of
ancient
bills
of
attainder
and
some
of
the
tory
bill
of
attainder
in
this
nation.
they
weren't
state
clauses
where
these
men
could
go
to
court
and
prove
they
weren't
tories.
at
least
they're,
when
they
surrendered
the
justice
--
mr.
charles
clark
both
your
honor.
mr.
charles
clark
this
is
what
we're
in
right
now.
that's
why
i
wanted
to
bring
to
your
honors
attention
that
mississippi
was
picked
up
out
of
the
courtroom
and
brought
before
congress
and
convicted
and
then
handed
back
to
the
courts.
this
is
what
happened
to
--
and
as
i
say,
the
trouble
is
that
you
talk
about
states
and
nobody
can
put
their
hand
on
a
state.
but
i'm
talking
about
people
in
mississippi.
i'm
talking
about
individuals
who
have
a
right
under
the
rules
of
this
court,
not
to
have
their
votes
diluted
by
people
who
are
not
qualified
under
state
law
to
vote.
or
by
people
who
ought
to
be
qualified
to
vote.
mr.
charles
clark
fairly
state
law.
yes
your
honor,
i
accept
that
premise.
mr.
charles
clark
i
accept
that
premise
entirely.
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
are
valid.
the
laws
requiring
its
electros
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
are
valid
laws.
and
when
congress
says
you,
can't
have
those
laws
anymore
unless
you
surrender
and
go
to
a
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
try
your
lawsuit.
it
has
passed
a
bill
of
pains
and
penalties.
mr.
charles
clark
absolutely
not
sir.
absolutely
not,
i've
never
--
mr.
charles
clark
how
does
it
get
to
that,
your
honor
please?
by
trying
the
states
involved.
mr.
charles
clark
but
in
the
--
mr.
charles
clark
absolutely
not,
mr.
justice
black.
but
it
is
a
punishment
when
a
group
of
citizens
categorized
by
geography
because
they
are
in
a
state.
it
is
punishment
when
those
individuals
are
denied
the
right
to
have
a
republican
form
of
government
to
establish
the
rules
that
they
choose
to
govern
themselves.
mr.
charles
clark
and
one
of
them
is
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
it
says
that
you
can't
have
a
law
that
you
can't
have
state
action
that
discriminates
on
voting
on
account
of
race
or
color.
mr.
charles
clark
may
i
answer
your
question
by
asking
you
one.
if
congress
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
and
they
authorize
it,
and
i
mean
it
to
be
rhetoric.
if
congress
determined
that
the
communist
menace
was
dangerous
to
this
government
and
could
if
unchecked
result
in
the
overthrow
of
this
government
by
force
and
violence.
let's
give
it
--
that's
just
a
noble
motive
that
comes
to
my
mind
because
it's
been
involved
in
recent
litigations.
it's
no
less
noble
motive
for
congress
than
this
law.
but
if
congress
chooses
to
get,
if
congress
chooses
to
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir,
constitutional
foul.
and
i
hope
the
court
will
accept
that
congress'
motive
is
absolutely
immaterial.
but
let's
say
they
had
a
high
end
and
they
passed
a
piece
of
legislation
that
says
members
of
the
communist
party
can't
hold
union
office.
this
is
a
privilege.
certainly,
no
man
has
a
right
to
a
union
office.
this
is
what's
classified
in
the
laws
on
and
their
privilege.
but
if
that
can't
be
done
because
of
the
bill
of
attainder
section
of
the
constitution,
then
by
the
same
token,
congress
can't
act
under
the
second
clause
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
of
that
same
bill
of
attainder
law.
and
i
only
mean
to
say
that
they
can't
act
as
they
have
done
here,
i
don't
mean
to
diminish
--
mr.
charles
clark
the
key
is
the
date,
mr.
justice
black,
november
1,
1964.
this
is
what
this
law
is
about.
they
didn't
want
a
law,
they
wanted
a
rule,
they
wanted
the
type
of
rule
that
comes
from
a
court.
let
me
say
this,
the
classic
--
one
of
the
classic
examples
involves
epileptics
in
driving.
certainly,
congress
could
pass
a
law
that
would
say
epileptics
can't
operate
automobiles
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but,
with
the
same
intention,
the
same
motive,
congress
can't
say,
the
people
who
occupy
the
home
for
epileptics
at
304
k
street
on
november
1,
1964,
can't
in
the
district
of
columbia,
have
named
it
solely.
people
in
that
home,
they
stated
that
they
had
592
doctors
that
all
appeared
before
congress
and
swore
to
the
congressional
committees
that
the
people
that
were
living
in
that
home
for
epileptics
at
304
k
street
on
november
1,
1964
were
advanced
epileptics,
subject
to
seizures
momentarily.
and
that
every
doctor
said
unanimously,
they
ought
not
drive,
well
they
will
kill
people.
congress
can't
pass
that
law,
only
because
of
the
attainder
clause.
it
is
not
a
question
of
disabling
congress
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
there
is
some
type
of
history
that
puts
more
force
in
the
enforcing
clause
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
it
puts
in
the
body
of
the
amendment
itself.
but
that's
not
our
difference.
our
differences
is
whether
congress
in
pursuing
that
--
mr.
charles
clark
this
is
a
clause
--
mr.
charles
clark
not
--
it's
in
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth,
it's
in
all
of
these
amendments.
mr.
charles
clark
but
they
can't
reach
them
mr.
justice
black
by
adjudicating
them
in
congress
across
the
street
from
here.
this
is
the
place
where
adjudications
are
passed.
mr.
charles
clark
this
court
is
committed
to
the
principle
that
any
deprivation
is
within
the
attainder
clause
if
the
class
is
specified.
let
me
read
just
briefly,
these
are
the
words
of
the
brown
opinion
that
came
down
contrary
to
what
the
justice
department
thought
it
would
while
it
was
appearing
before
congress.
the
evil
the
framers
sought
to
bar
legislative
punishment
of
any
form
of
severity
of
specifically
designated
persons
of
roots.
the
only
thing
that
i
need
to
prove
to
you
is
that
congress
designated
the
states.
you
can
take
two
simple
documents,
both
of
which
any
courts
entitled
to
take
judicial
notice
of.
you
can
take
the
census
figures
and
you
can
take
the
attorney
general's
determination
of
what
state
law
is,
he
didn't
need
the
makers
determination,
it's
a
matter
of
any
court
to
take
judicial
knowledge
of.
those
two
simple
things
added
to
this
act,
name
every
state
and
every
county,
just
as
surely
as
if
the
spelling
had
been
there
in
the
bill
itself.
and
it
can't
help
but
be
a
classical
bill
of
attainder;
it
can't
help
but
be
the
embodiment
of
theory
itself.
i
would
like
to
close
with
one
brief
quotation.
“we
live
in
an
age
of
anxiety,
but
so
did
the
framers
of
our
constitution.
we
would
do
well
to
heed
their
warning
and
calm
an
anxious
ages
alike.
the
accumulation
of
all
powers
of
legislative,
executive
and
judiciary
in
the
same
hands
whether
of
one
or
few
or
many,
whether
the
hereditary,
self-appointed
or
elective
may
just
let
be
pronounced
the
very
definition
of
theory
and
congress
made
the
rule
and
congress
applied
the
rule
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
brought
it
within
the
ambit
of
this
act
and
that
can't
help
but
be
a
bill
of
attainder.”
thank
you,
sir.
