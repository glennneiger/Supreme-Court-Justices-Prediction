mr.
levin
h.
campbell
may
it
please
the
court.
massachusetts
appears
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
we
are
honored
to
be
represented
in
oral
argument
by
a
distinguished
citizen
of
massachusetts,
the
former
solicitor
general
of
united
states,
archibald
cox
who
today
appears
before
this
court,
will
appear
before
this
court
as
a
special
assistant
attorney
general
of
massachusetts.
mr.
cox
will
argue
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
the
greater
part
of
massachusetts
time
will
be
given
over
to
mr.
cox's
argument.
before
mr.
cox's
argument,
however,
i
shall
address
myself
for
10
minutes
or
eight
or
nine
minutes
to
a
single
point
which
i
believe
it
is
most
important
to
make
clearly
at
the
outset
namely
massachusetts'
deep
interest
in
this
case
as
chief
of
the
massachusetts
attorney
general's
division
of
civil
rights
and
liberties
and
as
a
regular
staff
member
who
deals
regularly
and
primarily
with
matters
inside
the
borders
of
our
state,
perhaps
i
can
make
this
point
even
more
urgently
than
can
mr.
cox.
and
may
i
say
parenthetically
of
course
that
massachusetts
has
been
joined
in
its
brief
amicus
curiae
by
18
other
states,
five
of
which
like
massachusetts
have
literacy
test
and
13
of
which
do
not
have
any
form
of
literacy
test
and
of
course
all
of
these
states
share
our
concern
and
interest.
admittedly,
the
1965
act
does
not
suspend
tests
and
devices
in
massachusetts.
we
have
a
literacy
test
but
the
act
does
not
affect
our
literacy
test.
this
is
because
the
act
is
concerned
not
with
literacy
test
per
se,
but
only
with
their
use
as
so-called
engines
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
levin
h.
campbell
well,
i
would
feel
your
honor
--
mr.
levin
h.
campbell
--
that
the
purpose
--
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
with
the
triggering
mechanism
and
the
--
mr.
levin
h.
campbell
the
tests
are
certainly
--
are
certainly
related
but
only
tests
were
--
mr.
levin
h.
campbell
conceivably
that
would
--
that
would
be
so.
mr.
levin
h.
campbell
yes.
and
it
might
well
be
the
effect
in
some
areas.
massachusetts
--
i
might
go
on.
massachusetts
is
directly
and
vitally
concerned
with
ending
the
denial
everywhere
in
the
nation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
negro
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
what
i
perhaps
would
like
to
emphasize
is
the
interest
that
massachusetts
has
in
saying
that
the
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
throughout
the
nation
are
enforced
and
a
much
greater
interest
perhaps
that
we
have
in
this
that
in
the
question
of
literacy
test
as
such.
i
might
say
that
even
in
my
state
there
is
considerable
question
now
as
to
the
continuation
of
the
massachusetts
literacy
test.
the
day
as
long
since
vanished
that
if
it
ever
existed
when
systematic
denial
of
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
in
one
or
more
states
could
be
regarded
mainly
as
a
local
phenomenon.
let
me
outline
a
few
of
the
reasons
why
this
appears
to
be
so.
last
august,
i
was
sent
by
the
attorney
general
to
springfield,
massachusetts
where
incidents
which
had
occurred
which
we
feared
might
lead
to
racial
disturbances
of
the
type
that
have
occurred
in
many
northern
and
western
cities.
fortunately,
the
immediate
trouble
in
springfield
subsided,
but
my
point
is
that
springfield,
massachusetts
like
boston,
like
new
bedford,
like
cambridge,
like
other
massachusetts
cities
and
areas
has
a
steadily
growing,
very
large
negro
population.
between
1950
and
1960,
the
total
negro
population
of
massachusetts
grew
by
approximately
50,000.
of
these
inquiries,
we
estimate
that
almost
50%
or
25,000
came
from
outside
the
state.
in
many
cases,
these
new
citizens
came
from
the
southern
states.
is
it
not
plain
that
massachusetts
is
deeply
and
vitally
concerned
by
the
attitudes
and
the
backgrounds
that
these
new
residents
bring
to
our
state.
we
want
them
to
be
law
abiding
to
participate
as
good
citizens
in
our
electoral
process
and
yet
one
wonders
what
attitudes
a
man
or
a
woman
is
going
to
bring
into
a
state
where
he
has
been
the
victim
of
systematic
discrimination.
a
man
or
a
woman
who
has
been
systematically
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
one
state
can
hardly
be
blamed
if
he
or
she
is
apathetic
or
defiant
or
suspicious
or
even
hostile
towards
the
law
and
towards
organized
society
in
the
new
state
to
which
he
is
moved,
and
increasingly,
as
i
say
massachusetts
and
the
northern
and
the
western
states
are
becoming
the
homes
of
citizens
who
are
born
in
other
states.
i
don't
say
this
is
a
kind
of
a
cheap
and
easy
way
to
shift
responsibility
from
our
own
shoulders
to
those
of
our
southern
sister
states.
we
have
our
problems
in
massachusetts
and
we
are
certainly
learning
that
the
condition
that
the
problems
that
we
have
and
the
forms
of
discrimination
that
we
may
have
in
some
of
our
states
maybe
just
as
persistent
and
just
as
difficult
as
those
in
the
southern
states.
but
at
least
a
legalized
discrimination
does
not
exist,
and
while
eliminating
the
growth
reforms
of
legalized
discrimination
throughout
our
nation
won't
solve
all
the
problems
it
is
certainly
obvious
that
there
can
be
no
final
solution
so
long
as
the
law,
the
courts
and
the
authorities
in
some
portions
of
our
country
actually
support
and
encourage
discriminatory
practices
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
this
is
a
matter
of
concern
to
all
of
the
states.
basically,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we
are
one
nation.
the
truth
is
that
the
problem
of
creating
the
conditions
of
just
and
equitable
relationships
between
the
races
is
a
national
problem.
it's
not
a
problem
that
belongs
to
the
one
or
the
other
of
the
states.
in
our
mobile
society
and
an
agent
mass
communications
as
well
as
mass
travel,
a
state
cannot
discriminate
and
expect
the
resultant
attitudes
that
feelings
and
resentments
and
consequences
to
stop
at
that
states
own
borders
and
not
to
be
a
matter
of
concern
to
other
states.
i
will
just
mention
one
or
two
other
points
before
concluding
on
this
matter,
but
certainly
we're
concerned
in
massachusetts
not
only
with
negro
citizens
who
come
into
our
state,
we're
concerned
with
the
right
of
citizens
of
our
state
to
move
out
of
massachusetts
and
would
become
residents
of
other
states
and
to
enjoy
their
constitutional
rights
in
those
states.
increasingly,
this
becomes
tied
into
economics,
to
jobs
as
it's
obvious,
most
--
many
jobs
now
in
private
industry
or
in
the
government
involve
travel,
involve
residence
elsewhere
and
massachusetts
negro
citizens
may
it
be
in
georgia
or
mississippi
or
in
illinois
or
california
one
or
two
years
from
now.
mr.
levin
h.
campbell
i
can't
find
--
i
can
imagine
many
--
mr.
levin
h.
campbell
i
certainly
--
i'm
sure
they
feel
that
way
your
honor.
of
course,
we're
not
complaining
about
--
if
these
were
questions
of
customs,
i
wouldn't
be
here
today
and
i
think
that
it's
a
question
of
constitutional
rights.
i
will
conclude.
i
could
go
on
and
mention
questions
of
foreign
policy.
i
could
mention
many
other
issues
and
i
realize
it
in
the
sense
i
am
simply
building
[inaudible]
and
repeat
points
which
are
obvious
to
the
court.
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
and
the
reason
that
we
have
filed
this
amicus
brief,
the
reason
that
many
states
have
joined
us
in
this
amicus
brief
is
that
the
question
of
the
relationships
between
the
races,
the
questions
of
the
effective
constitution
simply
are
no
longer
malice
which
has
to
deal
with
how
the
state
treats
its
citizens
or
that
states
treat
its
citizens
and
other
states
really
aren't
interested.
we
are
all
interested
in
problem
that
we
have
to
face
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
relationships
between
citizens
in
this
country
are
problems
which
are
as
important
to
massachusetts
or
to
california
or
to
illinois
as
they
are
to
what
mississippi
or
to
georgia.
thank
you.
