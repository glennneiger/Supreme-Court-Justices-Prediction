mr.
robinson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
robinson,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
if
congress
found
from
the
testimony
before
in
its
hearings
that
there
had
been
certain
discrimination
against
negroes
in
many
parts
of
the
country
and
then
it
wanted
to
enact
the
law
to
prevent
it,
could
it
not
have
a
starting
formula
for
taking
care
of
those
situations
where
they
have
been
discriminated
--
just
let
me
finish
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
there
had
been
discrimination
and
say,
any
state
that
finds
itself
in
this
condition
is
subject
to
the
provisions
of
certain
sections
of
the
act,
4,
5,
and
6.
but
that
in
the
future,
after
we
have
gone
through
that
procedure,
in
the
future,
it
would
be
judged
or
each
case
will
be
judged
in
a
different
--
according
to
a
different
formula
or
to
a
different
procedure,
now
would
that
modify
equally
to
all
states
and
why
is
that
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
if
it
has
occurred
in
certain
states,
then
congress
was
to
have
a
starting
point
to
remedy
this
situation.
i
ask
you,
why
you
say
that
it
applies
just
to
those
states?
apparently,
it's
been
applied
also
to
alaska
and
i
don't
think
anyone
had
any
idea
that
alaska
came
on
to
this
act
because
we
thought
that
we
never
heard
about
any
such
discrimination
there.
but
it
did
fall
under
it
apparently
and
i
don't
see
why
any
other
state
that
was
in
the
same
condition
wouldn't
have
been
subject
to
the
act
as
you
are
and
therefore,
it
would
be
a
general
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
congress
--
hasn't
congress
provided
other
procedures
for
taking
care
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
hasn't
it
also
provided
the
procedure
for
those
who
find
themselves
in
that
condition
to
take
themselves
out
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure?

i

mr.
attorney

mcleod.
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen
before
the
court
adjourns,
i
should
just
like
to
say
that
in
addition
to
this
being
the
most
important
case,
one
involving
wide
ramifications
and
with
profound
implications
in
the
life
of
our
nation
that
it
is
the
most
unique
case.
this
is
unique
in
at
least
two
respects.
first,
in
spite
of
the
questions
involved,
both
sides
have
come
in
to
this
court
and
have
done
everything
they
could
to
accelerate
the
legal
process
so
that
a
judgment
can
be
obtained
and
they
have
cooperated
with
each
other
and
with
the
court
in
every
respect
in
order
to
make
our
problem
more
simple.
then
in
addition
to
that,
i
should
just
like
to
say
that
it
is
unique
in
the
sense
that
in
response
to
our
invitation,
more
than
half
of
the
states
of
the
union
have
come
in
to
this
court
and
have
made
their
presentations
to
the
court
on
both
sides
of
the
questions.
i
can
say
that
the
court
is
indebted
to
hold
them
and
to
counsel
on
both
sides
of
the
case
for
the
scholarly,
lawyer
like
manner
in
which
presentations
for
and
written
had
been
made
to
the
court
and
the
court
in
indebted
to
all
who
have
participated
in
the
case.
we'll
now
adjourn.
