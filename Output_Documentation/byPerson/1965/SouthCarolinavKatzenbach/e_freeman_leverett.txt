mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
georgia
like
south
carolina
is
brought
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
by
virtue
of
the
number
of
first
instant
voting
in
the
1964
general
election
rather
in
the
number
of
people
who
are
registered
to
vote
that
year.
in
1964,
63%
of
all
persons
of
voting
age
in
georgia
were
registered,
but
only
43.2%
of
the
persons
of
voting
age
actually
voted
in
the
1964
general
election.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
we
think
that's
one
reason
that
is
always
comparatively
a
lower
percent
of
people
voting
in
our
state
because
18-year
olds
do
not
tend
to
register
and
vote
as
much
as
adults.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
did
not
have
a
primary
of
any
consequence
that
year
that
i
recall.
we
had
one
in
1962
for
governor
and
the
voting
in
the
primary
for
governor
in
1962
i
think
was
somewhat
smaller
than
the
vote
into
presidential
election.
i'd
like
to
discuss
one
or
two
instances
of
what
we
conceive
to
be
arbitrary
application
of
the
triggering
mechanism
of
the
voting
rights
act
then
i
will
deal
with
section
5
as
a
general
proposition.
the
effect
of
section
4
is
to
raise
a
presumption
of
discrimination
at
the
registration
stage,
but
georgia
like
south
carolina
is
brought
under
the
act
by
virtue
of
something
that
happened
at
the
voting
stage
that
only
80%
of
the
registered
voters
in
georgia
in
1964
voted
georgia
would
not
have
been
brought
under
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
therefore,
we
say
that
there's
no
rational
connection
between
the
fact
presumed
and
the
fact
assumed.
secondly,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
act
operates
to
suspend
one
aspect
of
registration
because
of
discrimination
assumed
to
occur
at
that
stage,
it
appears
that
georgia
has
a
higher
percentage
of
its
voting
age
population
registered
than
the
five
states
of
arkansas,
florida,
hawaii,
kentucky
and
texas,
none
of
which
are
subject
to
the
act.
thirdly,
all
the
159
counties
in
georgia
are
placed
under
the
act
when
in
fact
complaints
of
discrimination
have
been
limited
to
two
or
three,
perhaps
four
small
counties
in
southwest,
georgia.
we
have
had
only
two
counties
involved
in
voting
rights
suits.
one
county,
randolph
county
involved
a
damage
suit
in
1955.
there's
been
no
problem
since
that
time.
there
were
two
suits
in
terrell
county,
georgia
in
19
--
one
in
1958
and
one
in
the
60's.
and
in
1964,
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
reported
that
voters
were
being
permitted
to
register
without
difficulty
in
terrell
county.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
not
in
georgia
that
i
recall.
i
think
there
has
been
evidence
that
in
some
states,
challenges
were
initiated
in
other
states,
but
i
do
not
recall
any
of
that
type
of
thing
in
georgia.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
one
state
that
i
specifically
recall
that
challenges
were
instituted
on
a
discriminatory
basis
by
a
white
citizens'
council.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
we
point
out
that
the
negro
vote
in
almost
of
the
urban
counties
in
georgia
is
the
controlling
force.
i
think
georgia
probably
has
a
record.
we
have
10
negro
members
of
the
general
assembly,
two
in
the
senate
and
eight
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
yet
the
effect
of
the
act
is
to
place
all
of
the
counties
of
georgia,
all
159
counties
under
the
act
when
it
is
obvious
that
no
discrimination
has
been
practiced
in
fulton,
dekalb,
muscogee,
chatham
and
richmond
counties
in
many,
many
years
and
there's
no
evidence
of
discrimination
in
the
great
majority
of
the
other
counties.
since
the
act
declares
that
it
applies
in
any
political
subdivision
within
a
state
where
less
than
50%
of
the
person's
of
voting
age
voted,
there's
no
reason
why
that's
even
though
the
state
itself
voted
less
than
50%,
there's
no
reasonable
reason
why
that
same
requirement
was
not
made
in
the
act
as
a
general
proposition
so
that
this
act
would
be
applicable
only
to
a
particular
political
subdivisions
where
the
necessary
percentage
was
not
met.
four,
the
presumption
established
by
section
4
applies
as
attorney
general
katzenbach
testified
before
the
senate
committee
in
any
state
where
the
formula
has
met
even
though
no
discrimination
in
fact
existed
in
that
state.
five,
although
100%
of
all
of
the
persons
of
voting
age
were
actually
registered
in
the
state,
therefore,
conclusively
rebutting
any
discrimination
in
the
registration
state
the
act
nevertheless
applies
if
less
than
50%
actually
voted
in
the
election.
the
act
does
become
operative
not
because
of
state
action
but
because
of
the
apathy
of
voters
in
going
to
the
polls.
six,
the
act
raises
a
presumption
of
discrimination
states
where
literacy
test
or
in
effect
from
percentages
of
citizen's
voting
which
exceed
those
existing
in
other
areas
to
which
the
act
does
not
apply
namely
texas
and
the
district
of
columbia.
seven,
the
act
covers
120
counties
in
georgia,
every
one
of
which
voted
a
larger
percentage
of
its
persons
of
voting
age
than
did
the
state
of
texas.
there
were
71
counties
in
georgia
where
more
than
50%
of
the
re
--
of
the
person's
of
voting
age
actually
voted.
none
of
the
larger
counties
other
than
dekalb,
i
think,
and
this
illustrates
to
me
the
arbitrariness
of
the
presumption
as
applied
to
georgia,
there's
never
been
any
claim
of
any
discrimination
in
the
urban
counties
and
yet
those
counties
voted
substantially
less
percentage
of
their
people
of
voting
age
than
did
many
rural
counties.
dekalb
county
is
--
which
has
posted
along
is
the
only
county
of
any
size
in
georgia
which
voted
more
than
50%
of
it's
population
in
the
presidential
election.
the
eighth
observation
that
we
would
like
to
make
is
the
fact
that
the
act
is
not
even
directly
related
to
negro
voting
although
every
negro
of
voting
age
was
registered
and
actually
voted
in
the
presidential
election.
the
act
would
nevertheless
be
applicable
if
an
insufficient
number
of
other
persons
failed
to
vote.
on
the
sum
total
of
these
considerations,
we
submit
that
the
voting
rights
act
is
left
exposed
as
an
unconstitutional
effort
to
supersede
the
qualifications
for
voting
prescribed
by
a
state.
congress
admittedly
could
not
pass
a
law,
striking
down
these
qualifications
direct.
we
submit
that
it
cannot
accomplish
the
same
thing
indirectly.
i
think
we
need
to
distinguish
between
the
types
of
classification.
now,
under
the
commerce
clause,
congress
engages
in
a
classification
because
it
does
not
want
the
impact
of
a
law
to
fall
on
a
particular
object.
in
the
voting
rights
act,
the
congress
undertook
to
set
up
a
classification
or
formula
because
it
had
to
in
order
to
make
the
act
constitutional.
it
had
to
set
up
a
formula
which
would
undertake
to
make
it
applicable
--
the
act
applicable
only
to
instances
of
racial
discrimination.
in
the
commerce
type
of
classification,
there
is
no
equal
protection
clause
applicable
to
congress
and
currin
versus
wallace
relied
upon
by
the
government
simply
holds
that
there's
no
uniformity
requirement
other
than
the
due
process
clause
which
imposes
a
very
general
prohibition
against
arbitrary
action.
that
is
not
true
here
because
if
the
--
if
the
classification
is
arbitrary
in
this
instance,
it's
not
just
simply
a
question
of
due
process
but
it's
a
question
of
the
act
having
an
impact
in
an
area
where
congress
is
not
authorized
to
legislate
as
i
would
come
to
momentarily.
what
the
voting
rights
act
seeks
to
do
is
to
deal
with
illegal
administration
by
striking
at
the
law
itself.
this
is
not
permissible.
this
was
settled
we
think
in
a
case
cummings
versus
national
bank
in
1880.
in
that
case,
the
state
had
structured
its
ad
valorem
tax
laws
in
such
a
manner
as
the
court
found
to
invite
discrimination
by
the
equalizers
as
between
varying
classes
of
taxpayers.
moreover,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
law
had
in
fact
had
this
effect
and
therefore
a
challenge
was
made
to
the
law
itself
and
this
court
said
that
a
law
cannot
be
held
unconstitutional
because
while
it's
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
constitution,
it
is
unfaithfully
administered
by
those
who
are
charged
with
it's
executions.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
just
as
reasonable
to
say
that
because
in
times
past
some
states
have
abused
their
police
power
that
the
laws
finding
this
police
power
could
be
suspended
under
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause.

cummings
versus

101
u.s.

there's
some
similar
language
mr.

black
in
the
monongahela
bridge
case
--
mr.
e.

leverett
--
in
216
u.s.

coming
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
i
think
they
have
some
evidence
of
some
discrimination.
the
attorney
general
put
in
his
files
that
showed
he
had
made
about
10
investigations
in
southwest
georgia.
mr.
e.

the
two
cases
that
--
he
did
not
report
to
the
randolph
county
case.
the
one
case
that
he
put
in
before
congress
did
involve
the
use
of
the
literacy
test
and
abuse
maladministration
of
the
literacy
test.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
--
mr.

freeman
leverett
by
name
--
naming
the
state?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
could.
that
is
a
question
that
frankly
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
one
way
or
another,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
it
because
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
its
own
force
would
do
that.
neal
versus
delaware
of
course
this
court
held
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
self-executing
so
you
would
not
need
a
statute.
now,
while
the
congress
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
i
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
going
to
deal
with
that
at
this
point.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
--
not
universally
(voice
overlap).
in
some
areas
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it's
already
done
something
about
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
certainly,
i
think
the
existing
law
was
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
has
already
done
it.
it's
made
certain
things
of
crimes.
it
has
conferred
civil
calls
of
action
for
damages
and
for
equitable
relief
and
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to
in
randolph
county.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
our
position
is
they
cannot
go
after
the
law
itself.
i
think
the
court
can
after
the
facts
have
shown
that
in
that
particular
area
the
law
has
been
abused
but
that's
done
not
to
simply
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you've
already
done
that
in
louisiana
versus
united
states,
but
there
is
a
distinction
between
what
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
i
am
not.
i'm
bound
by
it.
i
think
that
upon
the
basis
that
it
was
put
that
it
is
sustainable
and
that
is
to
afford
relief
against
to
cure
the
past
injustices
but
i
--
there's
a
great
distinction
between
that
and
what
congress
has
done.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it's
a
--
let
me
--
i'm
going
to
be
deal
with
that
momentarily
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
there's
a
difference
that
i
will
attempt
to
point
out.
i
would
like
first
to
deal
with
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
black
yesterday
and
that
is
the
congress's
power
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i'd
like
to
deal
with
this
by
posing
three
hypothetical
situations.
suppose
congress
should
decide
in
1967
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
has
not
worked,
has
not
been
successful,
that
the
only
way
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
to
impose
severe
criminal
penalties,
and
since,
suppose
congress
further
finds
that
southern
juries
are
not
inclined
to
convict,
the
only
way
that
this
can
be
made
effective
that
the
only
way
that
they
can
enforce
this
amendment
is
by
providing
for
trial
by
three
judges
without
a
jury,
would
that
law
be
constitutional?
let's
take
another
situation.
suppose
that
in
1967,
congress
should
likewise
conclude
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
has
not
been
affective
and
the
only
way
to
enforce
it
would
be
to
deny
every
state
that
involved
in
a
discrimination
of
its
equal
suffrage
in
the
same
contrary
to
article
v,
could
congress
do
that?
well,
you
may
answer
that
by
saying
well
that
deals
with
inactive
congress
that
comes
in
to
direct
conflict
with
another
provision
of
the
constitution.
of
course,
our
reply
to
that
would
be
that
so
does
the
particular
act
here
that
article
i,
section
2
and
section
2
of
the
seventeenth
amendment
which
is
passed
in
the
states,
the
right
to
prescribe
qualifications
certainly
stands
as
a
prohibition
against
congress
dealing
with
the
problem
and
i
think
we
can
take
even
a
stronger
case.
assume
this
the
congress
should
decide
in
1967
that
the
only
way
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
of
the
difficulties
in
proving
discrimination,
the
attorney
general
will
tell
you
that
he
has
to
prove
a
pattern
and
he
has
to
prove
how
groups
of
15
or
20
white
people
were
treated
ten
prove
how
groups
of
15
or
20
colored
people
were
treated,
compare
to
show
that
they
were
treated
different
and
that
is
the
difficult
burden
of
proof
in
some
instances.
suppose
congress
recognizing
that
concludes
that
the
only
way
is
to
simply
say
that
any
deprivation
of
the
right
to
vote
for
any
reason
will
be
proscribed
without
limiting
it
to
discrimination
based
upon
the
race
because
of
the
inherent
difficulty
of
proving
that.
would
that
type
of
law
to
be
upheld
under
section
2,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question.
this
court
held
in
1876
that
it
could
not,
that
is
united
states
versus
reese.
the
key
i
think
to
the
construction
of
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
the
fact
that
the
amendment
does
not
say
that
congress
can
enforce
it
by
legislation.
it
says
by
appropriate
legislation.
now,
what
is
meant
by
appropriate?
obviously,
it
means
something.
it's
a
limiting
term.
it
qualifies
the
word
legislation.
it
cuts
it
down
somewhat.
we
think
that
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
word
appropriate
was
to
limit
congress
in
section
2
to
the
scope
defined
in
section
1
which
is
discrimination
based
on
race
and
calls
by
state
action.
legislation
which
is
not
limited
is
not
appropriate
and
congress
cannot
make
legislation
appropriate
simply
by
declaring
it
so
worded
otherwise
congress
would
not
distort
would
be
the
final
[inaudible]
of
the
constitution.
this
brings
me
to
section
5,
a
veto
power.
this
section
declares
that
with
regard
to
any
state
for
which
a
determination
has
been
made
by
section
4
that
no
new
qualification
standard
practice
or
procedure
different
from
that
existing
on
november
1st
1964
shall
be
effective
to
deny
any
person
the
right
to
vote
until
either
first,
the
district
court
and
the
district
of
columbia
makes
a
certain
determination
or
secondly
until
the
attorney
general
fails
to
object
to
the
law
within
a
period
of
60
days
after
it's
been
submitted
to
him.
now,
even
after
such
an
adjudication
by
the
district
court
or
failure
to
object
by
the
attorney
general,
section
5
declares
that
notwithstanding,
that
will
not
act
as
a
bar
to
any
federal
court
enjoining
the
use
of
any
such
new
law
or
standard.
before
congress,
the
attorney
general
sought
to
sustain
this
particular
section
by
drawing
an
analogy
to
the
freezing
principle
involved
in
louisiana
versus
united
states.
but
the
freezing
principle,
mr.
justice
white,
differs
in
this
--
in
these
respects
from
what
congress
has
sought
to
do
here.
first,
the
freezing
principle
applies
only
where
discrimination
has
been
found
to
exist
in
fact
by
evidence
in
a
judicial
hearing.
second,
the
freezing
principle
applies
only
in
the
particular
political
subdivision
where
this
discrimination
has
been
found
to
exist
where
section
5
by
the
attorney
general's
own
admission
applies
to
innocent
and
willful
conduct
alike.
for
example
in
the
louisiana
case,
the
freezing
doctrine
was
invoked
only
with
respect
to
21
of
the
state's
64
countries.
thirdly,
and
this
is
very
important,
the
freezing
principle
is
applicable
only
with
respect
to
the
victims
of
discrimination
that
is
those
persons
who
were
during
the
period,
discrimination
was
taking
place
where
voting
age
were
not
disqualified
because
of
conviction
of
felony
or
otherwise
will
qualify
under
the
state
law.
section
5
applies
regardless
of
whether
the
persons
involved,
wherever
the
victims
were
even
capable
of
being
the
victims
of
discrimination.
fourth,
under
the
freezing
principle,
the
suspension
of
state
law
automatically
is
ended
if
the
state
effectuates
a
complete
re-registration
under
section
5,
however,
even
though
the
state
conducted
a
complete
overall
re-registration
of
all
its
voters
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner,
section
5
would
still
apply
to
remove
by
some
court.
coming
to
the
constitutionality
of
section
5,
we
--
it
would
do
good
to
observe
that
assuming
that
the
triggering
mechanism
of
section
4
be
held
invalid.
section
5
would
likewise
fall
because
it's
dependent
for
it's
being
put
into
operation
by
section
4.
but
independently
of
that,
we
submit
that
there
are
two
independent
reasons
why
section
5
cannot
stand.
the
most
basic
premise
of
the
federal
system
is
that
stated
in
united
states
versus
harris,
every
valid
act
of
congress
must
find
in
the
constitution
somewhat
for
its
passage.
in
slaughter-house
cases,
this
court
recognized
that
we
have
in
this
nation
a
government
of
each
of
the
states
and
a
government
of
all
of
the
states,
that
it
is
a
dual
sovereignty
that
recognizing
that
this
type
of
situation
that
conflicts
would
inevitably
arise
between
the
two
governments.
the
constitution
provided
a
means
whereby
these
conflicts
could
be
resolved
in
article
iii
in
which
the
federal
judiciary
was
created,
but
the
congress
did
not
say
that
the
federal
courts
would
be
a
sense
of
moral
of
all
state
legislation.
if
you
were
limited
to
cases
in
controversies.
as
stated
and
as
delineated
there
faithfully
in
hamilton's
essay
in
number
78
of
the
federal
and
expounded
upon
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
cohens
versus
virginia,
we
think
the
unavoidable
deduction
which
must
be
gained
from
this
juxtaposition
of
dual
sovereignty
and
the
judicial
power
is
that
no
state
law
can
be
made
to
depend
upon
the
ascent
or
the
consent
of
any
federal
instrumentality
whether
the
court
or
otherwise.
means
havebeen
provided
both
for
resolving
these
conflicts
when
they
come
before
the
court
in
a
case
of
controversy
but
their
idea
of
a
dual
sovereignty
refutes
the
fact
that
the
law
of
a
state
can
in
the
first
instance
be
made
to
depend
upon
some
federal
agency
of
proving
it.
it's
pointed
out
by
general
mcleod
yesterday
that
was
one
of
the
evils
against
which
the
declaration
of
independence
railed
where
it
was
said
that
“for
suspending
our
own
legislation
and
declaring
themselves
invested
with
power
to
legislate
for
us
and
all
keepers
whatsoever”.
we
submit
that
if
the
congress
can
suspend
the
operation
of
a
state
law
for
five
years
or
until
some
federal
court
approves
it
that
it
can
suspend
it
for
a
100
years.
the
congress
can
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
let's
assume
in
advance
from
prior
misconduct
that
all
laws
thereafter
enacted
will
be
invalid,
so
to
could
it
assume
under
the
commerce
clause
that
because
states
had
in
some
times
past,
imposed
illegal
exactions
upon
interstate
commerce
that
no
state
income
tax
or
sales
tax
law
that
there
have
to
be
passed
until
such
time
as
it
had
been
approved
by
federal
court.
secondly,
aside
from
the
power
of
congress
to
require
federal
approval
as
a
condition
generally
of
a
state
law
becoming
effective,
we
think
that
the
act
here
is
subject
to
challenge
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
federal
tribunal
to
which
this
power
has
been
invested.
this
arises
because
of
the
fact
that
even
though
the
federal
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
makes
a
favorable
determination,
its
decision
is
not
binding
and
the
law
says
“that
neither
the
attorney
general's
failure
to
object
nor
a
declaratory
judgment
entered
under
this
section
shall
bar
a
subsequent
action
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
such
qualification
prerequisite
standard
of
practice.
we
submit
that
this
is
in
effect
an
effort
to
invest
the
federal
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
with
the
authority
to
render
advisory
opinions.
it
is
early
as
1792
when
congress
sought
to
vest
in
the
federal
courts
certain
duties
in
connection
with
the
granting
of
pensions.
it
was
--
it's
been
recognized
as
stated
by
circuit
court
in
the
footnote
to
hayburn's
case,
the
court
was
composed
of
chief
justice
jay
and
mr.
justice
cushing,
“that
neither
the
legislative
nor
the
executive
branches
can
constitutionally
assign
to
the
judiciary
any
duties
but
such
as
are
properly
judicial
and
to
be
performed
in
a
judicial
manner.”
one
year
later
in
1793,
president
washington
asked
this
court
for
an
opinion
or
advice
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
certain
treaties
and
the
laws
arising
out
of
the
french
revolution.
the
court
there
respectively
declined
to
do
so
and
since
that
time
no
principle
has
been
no
more
well
settled
in
that
the
federal
courts
in
article
iii
do
not
render
an
advisory
opinion.
in
chicago
versus
--
in
southern
airlines
versus
waterman
steamship
corporation,
this
court
struck
down
a
statute
which
sought
to
give
the
federal
courts
the
duty
of
rendering
an
opinion
on
a
matter
which
would
not
be
binding.
this
court
said
“that
would
be
to
render
an
advisory
opinion
in
its
most
obnoxious
form”
and
this
is
precisely
what
we
say
congress
is
sought
to
do
in
section
5.
in
the
o'donoghue
case,
that
the
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
were
held
to
be
constitutional
on
article
iii
courts.
in
the
glidden
case,
it
was
recognized
that
while
these
courts
might
also
perform
certain
local
functions
under
the
district
of
columbia
clause
like
state
courts
do
in
states
that
this
was
limited
to
functions
that
were
local
in
nature
not
national
in
character.
that
was
referred
to
in
the
body
of
the
decision
as
well
as
in
the
footnote
dealing
with
the
old
federal
radio
commission
case.
so
we
say
that
congress
cannot
impose
this
advisory
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
footage
with
the
glidden
case,
an
effort
to
do
so
results
in
that
jurisdiction
falling
not
in
the
court
losing
it's
article
iii
status.
the
man
who
authored
the
constitution
of
united
states
recognized
at
great
times
of
national
stress
imperiled
to
be
inflicted
upon
the
public.
to
this
end,
this
court
was
created
fortified
by
the
assurance
of
life
tenure
and
undiminished
compensation
against
what
hamilton
referred
to
as
“those
ill
humors,
which
the
arts
of
designing
men,
or
the
influence
of
particular
conjunctures,
sometimes
disseminate
among
the
people
themselves,
and
which,
though
they
speedily
give
place
to
better
information,
and
more
deliberate
reflection,
have
a
tendency,
in
the
meantime,
to
occasion
dangerous
innovations
in
the
government,
and
serious
oppressions
of
the
minor
party
in
the
community”.
we
don't
deny
the
discrimination
has
existed
in
some
parts
of
the
south.
i
don't
deny
that
it
has
existed
in
some
parts
of
georgia.
i'm
not
here
to
defend
it.
i'm
ashamed
of
it
and
i
join
with
the
court
and
everyone
else
in
condemning
it,
but
we
would
hope
that
simply
because
a
state
has
erred
in
the
past,
it
does
not
thereafter
lose
a
right
to
claim
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
was
enacted
on
unusual
circumstances.
i
need
not
refer
to
the
fact
that
i
think
that
to
paraphrase
justice
--
judge
wisdom
that
what
all
americans
know
this
court
knows
and
all
americans
know
that
the
congress
was
deliberating
under
the
pressure
and
influence
of
people
who
were
threatening
revolution
and
rebellion
in
the
streets
and
i
would
hope
that
as
long
as
this
court
sits
that
congress
cannot
to
appease
a
mob
in
the
streets,
invoke
an
unconstitutional
means
to
achieve
a
constitutional
means.
