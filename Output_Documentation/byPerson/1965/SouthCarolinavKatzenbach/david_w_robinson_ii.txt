mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
was
brought
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
certain
sections
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1964.
the
complaint
alleges
--
1965,
excuse
me.
the
complaint
alleges
the
passage
of
the
act,
its
application
to
south
carolina,
the
suspension
of
her
literacy
qualifications,
certain
of
her
voting
records,
voting
history,
the
population
characteristics
of
her
people
and
something
of
her
political
characteristics.
the
answer
for
the
most
part
denies
the
allegations
of
unconstitutionality
of
certain
sections
of
the
act.
this
hearing
is
held
pursuant
to
your
order
of
november
the
5th.
at
the
outset,
we
would
like
to
make
two
points
clear.
first,
we
do
not
here
challenge
the
purpose
of
this
act.
we
believe
that
every
man,
white
or
black,
who
can
--
who
possesses
the
reasonable
qualifications
proscribed
by
state
should
be
permitted
to
vote.
we
further
believe
that
congress
has
a
duty
to
enforce
the
prohibition
against
the
infringement
of
that
right.
second,
we
do
not
attack
most
of
the
provisions
of
this
act.
the
act
has
broad
remedial
provisions
which
give
courts
tools
to
move
in
and
stop
discrimination
in
the
use
of
literacy
qualifications.
we
do
not
here
questions
though.
our
attack
is
directed
to
some
two
and
a
half
of
the
act's
19
sections.
those
sections
which
automatically
suspend
south
carolina's
literacy
test
and
freeze
her
legislative
powers
without
any
court
hearing.
secondly,
these
are
sections
4,
5
and
6
(b)
of
the
act.
secondly,
whether
you
find
those
at
pages
82
to
85
of
the
appendix
our
initial
complaint
was
4,
5
and
6
(b).
secondly,
we
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
those
criminal
sections
which
make
certain
conduct
criminal
which
is
unrelated
to
state
action
and
is
unrelated
to
any
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
race.
those
are
sections
11
and
12
and
you'll
find
those
on
page
91
and
92
of
our
complaint
brief.
we
have
grouped
our
argument
into
two
parts,
those
reasons
why
these
sections
are
not
constitutionally
appropriate
and
those
reasons
why
these
sections
do
not
constitute
legislation.
first,
is
to
the
appropriateness.
this
act
is
grounded
upon
the
fifteenth
amendment,
which
requires
that
it'd
be
appropriate.
in
acting
under
this
amendment,
congress
must
legislate
against
the
background
of
the
entire
constitution.
and
we
submit
that
if
this
act
violates
fundamental
rights
secured
under
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
or
if
it
is
an
attempt
to
exercise
powers
which
the
fifteenth
amendment
does
not
bring,
it
cannot
be
appropriate.
these
sections
we
submit
do
both.
first,
the
constitution
as
originally
drawn,
never
gave
congress
any
powers
to
fix
voter
qualifications.
the
sole
permission
and
the
power
that
congress
had
in
the
article
1,
was
to
proscribe
in
connection
with
times,
places
and
manners
of
federal
elections,
in
effect
the
constitutions
of
each
state
were
incorporated
in
the
united
states
constitution,
insofar
as
voter
qualifications
are
concerned.
there
was
no
problem
of
the
supremacy
clause
with
respect
to
those
qualifications.
congress
never
had
the
power.
this
is
why
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
nineteenth
amendment
had
to
be
amendments.
congress
itself
could
not
move
into
this
area.
before
these
amendments,
there's
no
question
but
that
literacy
and
similar
property
and
other
reasonable
voter
qualifications
were
perfectly
legitimate
and
legal,
and
constitutional.
now,
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history,
the
language
of
the
amendment
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
today,
showed
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
gives
congress
no
power
to
suspend
lawful
reasonable
voter
qualification
proscriptions
of
the
states.
the
history
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
you
have
before
you
in
the
appendix
of
the
virginia
brief.
i
would
also
call
your
attention
to
the
new
book,
just
to
the
johns
hopkins
press
written
by
mr.
william
gillette,
entitled
the
right
to
vote.
this
is
a
connecticut
political
history
professor.
he's
done
a
beautiful
job.
these
authorities
clearly
show
that
the
authors
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
considered
and
unequivocally
rejected
the
idea
of
--
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
authorizing
congress
to
move
into
this
area
and
proscribe
or
strike
down
voter
qualifications,
in
connection
with
preventing
racial
discrimination.
now,
the
specific
language
of
the
amendment
is
clear.
the
right
to
vote
shall
not
be
denied
on
account
of
race.
the
power
given
to
congress
is
to
impose
these
prohibitions.
and
i
think
this
is
the
basic
difference
between
my
brother
and
myself.
he
contends
that
under
this
enforcement
power,
congress
has
the
right
to
anticipate
a
problem
and
move
in
and
prevent
that
problem.
gentlemen,
that
is
regulation.
that
is
the
power
that
congress
does
have
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
that's
a
plenary
power.
congress
has
all
of
the
powers.
it
surely
under
that
power
to
regulate,
in
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
it
can
anticipate
a
problem
and
meet
that
problem
before
it
occurs.
it's
mindful
of
a
city
council
with
zoning
laws.
the
city
council
can
proscribe
for
growth
problems
of
a
city
through
its
zoning
on
it's
will
before
they
have
it.
but
gentlemen,
this
is
the
power
to
regulate.
the
power
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
the
power
to
enforce.
this
is
a
power
that
the
policeman
has
on
the
street
corner.
policeman
cannot
arrest
me
as
a
citizen
because
he
thinks
there's
a
danger
that
i'm
going
to
commit
a
crime.
this,
you
gentlemen
have
said
over
and
over
again,
only
so
clearly
in
the
demonstration
cases,
that
crime
must
occur,
the
enforcement
power,
he
cannot
arrest
me
because
i
have
a
bad
record.
he
can
only
arrest
me
when
i'm
committing
a
crime.
this
is
congress'
power
to
legislate
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
is
the
power
to
prevent
only
what's
prohibited,
any
law.
we
are
told
that
the
reason
for
these
trigger
sections
is
that
literacy
test
may
be
abused
and
a
low
vote
indicates
that
they
will
be
abused.
any
law
gentlemen,
any
law
administered
by
man
is
subject
to
abuse.
the
fact
that
these
sections
may
be
abused
gives
congress
no
power
to
suspend
under
an
enforcement
power.
we
submit
that
none
of
the
defendant's
authorities
sustain
as
this
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
not
as
i
read
his
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
he
has
testified
before
congress
that
south
carolina
has
not
been
given
the
type
of
discrimination
of
massive
widespread
discrimination
of
both,
this
is
his
testimony.
he
never
charges
us
with
that
in
his
brief.
his
whole
brief
is
that
the
combination
of
these
two
factors
indicates
that
it
probably
will
have.
there's
a
danger,
as
i
read
his
brief.
this
is
the
whole
basis
that
he
would
sustain
as
legislation.
this
basic
distinction
was
made
by
this
court
in
the
civil
rights
cases.
mr.
justice
bradley,
and
i
call
your
attention
to
that
case,
particularly
his
language
at
pages
14
and
15
and
18.
mr.
justice
bradley,
the
civil
rights
cases
went
into
this
difference
between
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
and
a
power
of
congress
to
impose.
and
he
made
it
clear
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
has
the
identical
enforcement
power,
congress
could
not
move
into
this
field.
we
didn't
put
this
case
in
our
brief
because
we
had
no
idea
at
the
time
we
found
that
that
this
would
be
the
basis
of
the
government's
position.
finally,
i
would
ask
you
to
compare
the
differences
between
the
sections
that
we
attacked
and
those
that
we
don't
attack.
the
sections
that
we
don't
attack
are
proper
enforcement
tight
legislation.
they'd
given
the
courts
the
tool
to
move
in
and
correct
these
situations
where
they
occur.
the
sections
we
attacked
absolutely
regulate,
they
suspend
our
literacy
qualification.
they
paralyzed
our
legislature,
we
can
pass
no
more
laws
in
south
carolina
dealing
with
elections,
unless
we
come
to
washington
and
get
washington's
permission.
this
is
regulation,
and
this
power,
congress
does
not
have.
the
only
other
present
besides
the
interstate
commerce
clause
cases
on
which
the
defendant
relies
is
louisiana
versus
united
states
and
i'd
like
to
comment
on
that
if
i
could.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
louisiana
adopted
a
new
citizenship-type
test
for
registration.
the
court
said
this
was
top
or
within
the
test
that
you've
been
applying.
you've
got
to
give
the
same
test
to
everybody.
you
cannot
let
the
new
voters
or
make
the
new
voters
take
this
new
test
unless
you
make
everybody
take
it.
so
until
you
make
everybody
take
it,
we
suspend
it
and
leave
it
as
it
is.
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
new
test.
the
court
didn't
say
that
louisiana
couldn't
have
made
everybody
take
this
new
test.
this
is
the
same
thing
this
court
said
in
the
grandfather
clause
cases,
there's
nothing
new.
everybody
has
got
to
take
the
same
test,
everybody
got
--
has
the
same
qualifications,
this
is
proper.
south
carolina's
test
that
its
citizens
be
able
to
read
and
write
only.
we
don't
need
to
have
an
english
requirement,
read
and
write.
this
test
has
been
on
these
books
for
70
years.
we
require
re-registration
every
ten
years,
to
make
sure
that
if
one
guy
slipped
through
ten
years
ago
presumably,
there'd
be
new
administrators
in
ten
years,
he'll
have
to
take
it.
what
more
could
you
ask
for?
this
is
a
simple
test,
all
that
we
require.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it
has
been
administered
just
like
the
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no
your
honor.
we
require
them
to
read
a
section
of
the
constitution.
and
i
can't
speak
personally
except
where
i've
seen
it
in
my
own
county,
but
it's
been
a
short
two
or
three
words
or
sentence
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
fixed
it
up,
reads
out
loud,
and
there's
a
form
which
we've
reproduced,
attached
to
our
complaint
that
he
fails
out
showing
where
his
address
is
and
his
age
and
so
on,
so
he
didn't
know?
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
all
it
is.
that's
all
it
is,
and
they
gave
--
and
actually
they've
given
help
--
sometimes
it
takes
some
of
these
people
20
or
30
minutes
filling
up
but
they've
been
given
the
time
and
given
the
help
to
do
it.
if
you
go
and
have
a
literacy
requirement,
if
it's
permissible
to
have
one,
i
don't
think
that
our
requirement
could
be
any
simpler.
it's
much
simpler
than
new
york,
so
many
of
the
states
which
are
not
touched
by
this
law.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
don't
think
the
louisiana
case
is
applicable.
what
if
--
if
we
to
read
it
correctly,
all
the
louisiana
case
said
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
see
it.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
do
not
say
it
is
doing
so,
your
honor.
as
i
see
it,
all
the
court
there
said,
you'll
go
and
put
in
this
new
test.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
think
it
could.
i
think
that
louisiana
--
the
court
--
i
think
there's
the
difference
in
an
equity
power
and
a
legislative
power.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
do
not.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
i
don't
think
it
can.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
think
it
is
here.
because
we
don't
have
a
new
test,
first
of
all,
i
think
the
congress
--
if
congress
had
been
talking
about
louisiana,
they've
said,
“well,
you
put
in
a
new
test.”
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that
--
that's
our
position.
now
i
think
congress
could
send
in
federal
examiners
tomorrow.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
even
though
a
court
could.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
think
the
court
could.
no
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
said.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
said.
all
the
court
said
in
louisiana
was
“you've
got
two
tests.”
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it
was
suspended
because
it
was
a
new
test
and
all
--
the
court
didn't
say,
you
couldn't
put
in
the
new
test
tomorrow.
but
if
it
said
if
you
do,
you
got
to
make
everybody
take
it.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
don't
reach
that
question
in
our
position.
this
is
what
congress
has
attempted
to
do
in
section
3
(b),
i
believe
it
is
of
the
act.
i
would
question
then,
i
would
think
that
proper
remedy
for
the
court
would
be
to
send
any
examiners,
federal
or
otherwise
to
register
these
people
under
the
state
requirements
would
see
that
they
finally
registered.
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
requirement,
nothing
in
the
requirement
says
that
negroes
couldn't
vote.
certainly,
that
is
not
the
requirement
there,
but
the
literacy
requirement
is
not
bad.
it's
not
out
of
reason
to
require
that
people
be
able
to
read
and
write
--
read
and
write.
they
may
not
understand
the
government.
but
certainly,
if
they
cannot
read
and
write,
their
chances
have
been
not
understand,
how
much
high
than
why
won't
my
seven-year-old
daughter
vote?
she
can
read
and
write,
but
the
reason
for
the
age
requirement
is
designed
to
encourage
the
possibility
or
the
probability
that
your
people
will
understand
what
good
government
is.
and
this
is
all
that
a
literacy
requirement
is,
it's
not
a
bad
--
united
states
government,
requires
that
every
foreigner
who
comes
to
this
country
to
--
who
wants
to
become
a
citizen.
before
he
can
become
a
citizen,
he
must
be
able
to
read
and
write
the
constitution
in
english
and
understand
american
history.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
right.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
don't
think
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
--
that
would
be
the
proper
remedy.
and
that
congress
--
if
that
situation
occurs
and
if
congress
would
have
concluded
that
it
couldn't
in
no
way
even
with
federal
examiners
catch
up,
so
to
speak,
put
these
people
in
the
proper
proportion
--
congress
might
--
could've
even
require
re-registration
under
the
fair
test.
that
is
to
put
everybody
on
this.
but
the
test
itself
is
not
bad,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
test,
and
if
--
if
the
constitution
doesn't
give
congress
the
power
to
knock
the
test
down,
this
is
our
position.
and
even
it
has
pass
that
power,
our
second
point
here
is
that
congress
has
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
this
is
what
the
congress
said.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
said
they
cannot
do
that
on
the
enforcement
power.
i
said
maybe
they
would
require
re-registration,
but
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
test,
and
that
the
power
is
enforcement.
our
second
position
that
even
if
it
has
that
power,
these
sections
4,
5
and
6
violate
clearly
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment.
these
requirements
require
that
any
statutory
presumption,
one,
be
not
arbitrary.
that
is
to
say
that
the
conclusion
presumed
be
reasonably
related
or
reflected
in
human
experience
to
the
basic
facts
proven.
secondly,
that
it
not
be
irrebuttable.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it
does
not
in
itself,
your
honor,
say
they're
setting
up
a
presumption.
but
what
it
says,
if
these
two
things
exist,
that
is
if
there's
a
low
vote
and
if
you
have
a
literacy
test,
then
you
lose
your
literacy
test
unless
you
come
to
washington
and
be
declared
that
you
have
the
court
decide
that
you
haven't
been
discriminated.it's
a
presumption
in
effect.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
because
it
must
be
--
it
must
presume
racial
discrimination.
this
is
the
whole
part
of
the
act
under
fifteenth
amendment.
what
the
--
the
congress
is
acting
to
prevent
racial
discrimination
and
what
it
just
said
is
through
this
test,
there
was
or
is
a
danger
of
racial
discrimination
because
of
these
facts.
this
is
--
this
is
got
to
be
the
presumption
that
that
legislation
is
based
on.
otherwise,
it's
not
fifteenth
amendment
legislation.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
have
the
right
to
disprove
it,
well,
we
definitely
we
don't.
it's
irrebuttable.
and
--
can
i
first
address
myself
to
how
arbitrary
it
is
i
think.
the
presumption
says
that
we've
been
guilty
of
racial
discrimination
and
registration.
that
is
the
use
of
our
literacy
test
to
discriminate
and
who
we
let
get
registered.
but
the
act
is
not
applied
to
us
because
of
registration,
because
of
low
registration.
the
act
applied
--
is
applied
to
south
carol
--
solely
because
south
carolina
had
a
low
vote
in
the
presidential
election
of
1964.
now,
we
submit
that
human
experience
does
not
say,
does
not
tell
us
that
the
fact
that
registered
voters
did
not
vote,
is
evidenced
of
discrimination
and
registration.
the
fact
that
--
my
neighbor
stays
home
on
election
day
is
no
indication
that
the
officials
have
not
let
people
register
and
this
is
exactly
what
congress
has
done
to
us.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
south
carolina
has
56
point
something
of
its
total
over
21
population
registered.
it
voted
38%,
which
is
extremely
low.
the
evidence
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
this
is
i
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
every
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no
poll
taxes
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
--
no,
nothing.
no,
nothing.
that
congress
had
said
because
they
didn't
vote.
we
must
have
been
discriminating
on
racial
grounds.
and
this
just
does
it
on
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
on
registration.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
the
evidence
before
congress
doesn't
support
this
in
any
way.
the
evidence
before
congress
shows
that
there
were
four
states
with
massive
discrimination
which
were
not
covered
by
this
treatment.
it
showed
there
were
twos
--
and
those
four
states
registered
fewer
people
without
a
literacy
test.
and
south
carolina,
didn't
waive.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that
we
voted
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that
we
voted
--
he
invoked
that
by
point
--
we
voted
less
than
50%
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
that
is
only
one
state
corner
of
the
registration.
everybody
voted
over
50.
there
were
two
states
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
there's
only
one
state
that's
covered.
i
believe
mississippi
is
the
only
one
that's
registered.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
right.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
less
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
which?
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
but
which
--
and
where
there
was
evidence
presented
at
congress,
a
massive
racial
discrimination
who
registered
without
a
literacy
test,
no
more
than
fewer
percentages
than
south
carolina,
they're
not
covered.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
arkansas
56,
florida
54,
kentucky
51,
and
texas
56.3.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
registration
of
total
population.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no,
it
does
not.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
there
were
some
figures
before
congress.
i
think
that
indicated
some
36%,
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
of
virginia
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
34,
i
think
that
(voice
overlap)
--
i'm
not
sure,
probably,
we
had
--
i
do
not
know
but
we
don't
dispute.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
a
vote?
yes
your
honor,
we've
got
the
poll
voting
history.
we
attached
i
think
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
exhibit
c.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
in
our
original
papers,
exhibit
c1.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
page
21,
it's
a
pulled
out
page.
we've
tried
to
go
all
the
way
back
with
all
the
figures
we
could
find
on
primaries
and
general
elections.
the
figures
are
hard
to
come
by
because
the
records
have
been
kept
like
they
should
have
been.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
20%.
20%
of
our
adult
population
is
illiterate.
and
if
you
exclude
20%
from
the
total
21
vote
then
we
are
voting
and
registering.
or
we're
certainly
registering
right
at
the
national
average.
this
is
our
problem.
this
is
why
this
case
is
arbitrary
and
let
me
come
to
this
point,
if
i
may.
what
will
any
state
that
has
a
large
percent
of
illiterates
and
the
literacy
test
that
keeps
them
from
voting,
is
always
going
to
have
a
smaller
percent
of
its
population
registered
and
a
smaller
percent
that
can
vote
to
than
a
state
either
which
has
no
literacy
test
or
which
has
a
small
percent
of
illiterates.
look
at
the
facts,
every
state
is
covered
that
has
--
that
has
a
literacy
test,
also
has
a
huge
percentage
of
illiterates.
on
the
other
hand,
the
states
that
are
not
covered,
massachusetts
has
a
literacy
test,
6%
illiterate.
illiteracy
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
massachusetts.
california,
5%.
south
carolina
on
the
other
hand,
her
literacy
test
does
mean
something
with
20%
of
her
population
are
functionally
illiterate.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
of
the
adult
population.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
potential
voters.
what
congress
has
really
said
by
picking
these
factors
is
that,
south
carolina,
if
you
have
a
literacy
test,
if
you
have
a
lot
of
illiterates,
you're
bound
to
be
guilty
of
racial
discrimination.
and
that's
where
the
whole
thing
comes
down
to,
we
have
reproduced
the
figures
in
these
exhibits.
this
is
what
i'm
asking
you
because
we
have
a
lot
of
illiterates
and
because
we
keep
them
from
voting,
we
are
guilty
of
racial
discrimination.
now
gentlemen,
this
is
just
arbitrary.
this
--
it
has
no
basis,
we
submit
in
human
experience.
the
presumption
is
irrebuttable.
the
basic
purpose
of
a
statutory
presumption
is
like
here
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
that
is
by
proving
one
fact.
it's
up
to
you
to
disprove
a
conclusion.
this
is
what
a
burden
of
proof
is
or
back,
or
presumption.
let
me
take
the
facts
which
this
court
will
remember
from
gaining.
that
congress
said
that
if
a
man
was
present
at
a
whisky
still,
he
was
presumed
involved
in
making
the
whisky.
now
the
man
at
the
whisky
still
--
on
the
other
hand
if
he
could
come
in
and
prove
that
he
was
present
because
he
was
delivering
the
mail,
because
he
was
looking
for
john
jones
to
collect
the
rent,
he
could
explain
his
presence.
for
some
reason,
it
was
completely
unrelated
to
the
conclusion
that
is
being
involved.
the
whole
presumption
fail
and
it
wasn't
necessary
for
him
to
prove
that
he
was
not
involved.
but
if
a
man
either
could
not
or
did
not
explain
his
presence
at
the
whisky
still.
he
then
had
to
assume
the
burden
of
proof
and
that
he
was
not
involved
in
making
the
whisky.
what
is
the
basic
fact
here?
the
basic
fact
here
is
a
light
vote.
yet,
south
carolina
cannot
come
in
before
any
court
and
explain
why
it
had
a
light
vote.
we
have
attached
in
our
exhibits,
our
schedules
would
show
that
south
carolina's
population
characteristics
or
the
reasons
she
has
a
light
vote.
these
are
not
dangerous
grounds,
these
are
grounds
unrelated
to
race,
low
income,
low
education,
more
rural
population,
even
the
age
of
her
population
falls
into
non-voting
groups.
the
religion
of
her
population
even
falls
into
non-voting
groups
that
as
california
tells
us,
the
southern
negro,
when
he
goes
to
california
does
register
and
vote
when
presumably,
they
have
a
fair
case.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
this
is
what
they
assumed
but
we
administered
our
case
as
fairly
as
they
do
and
they
don't
vote
at
all.
this
is
of
course
his
assumption
but
we
think
it's
a
characteristic
that
people
just
--
and
this
char
--
these
are
non-dangerous
reasons,
because
all
we
want
the
opportunity
to
prove
it.
we
can't
come
into
court
and
prove
that.
the
only
recourse
that
south
carolina
has
under
this
theory
is
to
go
into
court
and
prove
that
it
hasn't
discriminated
for
a
single
day
for
the
past
five
years
in
racial
--
in
registration,
not
even
in
1964.
this
is
like
telling
the
criminal,
you
accuse
be
stealing
this
car
but
you
took
--
it'd
be
let
time
lose,
you've
got
to
prove
you
hadn't
stolen
a
car
for
the
last
five
years
as
well
as
this
car.
gentlemen,
how
does
the
state
come
into
a
court
to
prove
it
hasn't
done
anything?
how
do
i
come
into
court
and
prove
to
you
that
i
haven't
committed
a
crime.
i
know
i
have.
sure,
i
have
the
information
as
my
friend
would
tell
you,
we
had
--
but
how
do
i
prove
it?
we
can
bring
all
the
registrars
of
the
state
up
here
and
then
one
fellow
could
come
in
and
say
well,
three
and
a
half
years
ago,
i
applied
to
vote
but
you
didn't
let
me.
with
--
the
very
start
we
didn't
remember
the
fellow.
we
then
got
to
go
check
him
out
and
find
out
who
he
is
and
where
he
was,
and
so
it's
an
impossible
kind
of
burden
of
proof
is
what
i'm
trying
to
tell
you.
no
matter
how
innocent
you
are.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
it's
somehow,
i
think
it
perfectly
defines
what
you
have
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
that's
helpful.
i
think
this
tremendously
helps.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
it's
not
true
in
the
sense
that
--
i
of
course
do
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
it
would.
i
think
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
it
would
be
tremendously
helpful,
your
honors,
no
question
about
that.
we
had
took
on
that
burden.
how
do
you
prove
under
that
section
there's
no
danger?
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
do,
your
honor,
because
i
think
here
we
discuss
the
fundamental
governments
of
the
states.
congress
has
suspended
south
carolina's
legislature.
congress
has
taken
away
her
right
to
have
her
officers
chosen
by
literate
people,
by
people
who
can
read
and
write.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
of
course
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
let
me
say
this.
if
literacy
test
are
bad,
if
congress
has
decided
that
literacy
test
all
the
way
are
bad
things,
they
should
have
abolished
them
nationwide.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
think
they
could
your
honor
because
i
don't
think
that
the
article
--
as
we
tried
to
point
out,
the
fifteenth
amendment
gave
congress
the
power
to
regulate
suffrage
generally.
i
don't
think
they
could
have
done
that.
but
if
they
were
going
to
do
it,
this
is
what
they
should
have
done.
this
is
where
your
principles
of
equality
of
state
that
would
come
into
play.
if
there
ever
was
a
principle
that
that
i
know
of
in
the
history
of
this
country
has
been
that
each
state
was
entitled
to
equal
treatment.
we're
not
talking
here
about
the
different
classifications
based
upon
population
or
income
or
geographical
terms.
we're
talking
about
different
treatment
of
sovereignty.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
we
have
lost
our
right
to
enact
laws
and
to
have
a
leader
elected.
in
massachusetts,
california,
some
11
or
12
other
states
across
the
country
have
not.
our
sovereignty
has
been
treated
differently.
we've
been
told,
south
carolina,
you've
got
to
come
to
washington
and
you
get
to
be
declared
clean
before
you
can
do
these
things.
california
doesn't,
now
these
things
are
bad.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
of
course
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
but
if
the
basic
part
that
mr.
justice
black
has
mentioned
was
that
we've
lost
this
right
because
these
are
bad
things
and
it's
our
position
that
ought
to
be
done
away
with
the
initial
requirements.
of
course
the
facts,
we've
tried
to
show
that
we're
condemned
on
it.
the
facts
have
nothing
to
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
think
we
have
the
burden,
no
question
about
it.
the
defendants
then
made,
if
you're
innocent
he's
not
going
to
contend.
and
let
me
point
out
what
happened
in
this
case
even
if
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it
is,
and
i
apologize.
i
didn't
know
that
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i've
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
without
these
sections
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
under
the
other
sections
of
the
act?
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
have
no
objections,
none
whatsoever.
we
don't
question
those
other
sections,
your
honor.
let
me
mention
one
more
fundamental
provision
of
our
constitution,
it
seems
essential
to
me
that
i
think
may
put
a
little
different
light
on
it.
we
--
the
reason
for
forming
the
union
was
to
protect
the
governments
of
the
states.
this
was
the
whole
purpose
of
having
a
union,
was
to
put
each
state
to
join
together
to
preserve
others,
their
internal
governments.
these
sections
freeze
and
destroy
south
carolina
republican
government.
the
impact
of
here
--
of
these
illiterates
on
her
elections
is
going
to
be
tremendous.
we're
talking
about
20%
of
the
population,
that's
270,000
people,
she
only
voted
525,000
people
in
that
1964
election.
we're
not
talking
about
a
theoretical
problem,
i
wish
it
were
theoretical.
we
had
5
or
6%
population
illiterate,
we're
not
talking
about
the
major
problem
and
i
hope
that
they'll
come
and
we're
working
on
it.
when
we
are
--
we'll
be
in
that
category.
this
is
a
national
trend,
bt
gentlemen,
we
are
talking
about
a
tremendous
impact
on
south
carolina's
government.
we're
also
talking
about
freezing
her
legislature.
there
is
absolutely
no
president
in
the
history
of
this
union
for
the
central
government
telling
any
state
legislature
that
it
cannot
enact
law
unless
we
approve
it.
this
has
never
been
done
and
there's
no
need
to
do
it
here.
we
have
reproduced
at
appendix
a
in
our
first
brief
the
whole
history
of
changes
in
south
carolina's
election
alone,
in
the
entire
trend
over
this
whole
period,
it
has
been
to
liberalize
who
could
vote
and
make
it
easier
for
everybody
to
vote.
we
haven't
kept
anyone
from
voting
by
manipulating
our
laws.
there's
no
need
to
freeze
our
legislative
function.
there
are
several
other
reasons
looking
at
these
sections
against
the
fifteenth
amendment
alone
as
to
why
they're
not
appropriate.
getting
the
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
fifteenth
amendment
is
nationwide.
its
protections
are
nationwide,
as
we've
animated,
if
literacy
test
are
bad
they
ought
to
be
stricken
down
nationwide.
the
substance
of
the
amendment
is
to
prevent
discrimination.
it
doesn't
create
the
right
to
vote
for
anybody.
congress
here
has
created
the
right
of
an
illiterate
in
south
carolina
to
vote.
whether
the
administration
wants
more
people
voting
or
not
the
congress
has
no
power
to
do
this.
the
power
of
the
amendment
is
to
prevent
racial
discrimination.
white,
illiterates
in
south
carolina
vote.
her
legislature
is
frozen
regardless
of
whether
these
new
laws
had
anything
to
do
with
race.
the
power
is
to
prevent
--
is
the
grant
protection
against
state
actions.
the
criminal
sections
had
no
--
nothing
to
do
with
state
acts.
the
remedy
itself
is
excessive.
as
we've
animated,
there's
no
--
that
the
problem
here,
the
whole
problem
the
congress
had
is
misadministration.
and
we
submit
to
you
when
you
get
a
case
before
you
or
a
man
who
is
convicted
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
you
don't
go
with
the
law
under
which
he
was
convicted.
you
simply
reverse
the
conviction,
the
result
was
bad,
not
the
law.
here,
we've
got
a
good
law.
but
the
problem
is
misadministration.
look
at
the
minority
bill,
look
at
what
the
minority
of
the
congress
proposed.
this
was
a
bill
which
would
have
gone
to
misadministration
and
this
is
what
we're
talking
about.
there's
no
need
for
congress
to
move
in
and
strike
down
this
better
qualifications.
as
we've
animated
that
these
sections
are
not
tailored
to
the
known
problem
here;
it
doesn't
cover
states
where
congress
was
told
of
a
massive
discrimination.
it
does
cover
states
where
there
was
no
discrimination.
look
at
alaska,
hawaii,
idaho,
arizona,
it's
just
not
an
appropriate
piece
of
legislation.
finally,
it
unnecessary
it
blocks,
nails
the
courthouse
doors
shut.
if
a
local
community
in
south
carolina
wants
the
construction
of
this
bill,
the
only
court
that
it
can
come
to
is
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
then
it
only
has
subpoena
power
for
a
hundred-mile
radius
from
the
district.
there's
no
reason
that
this
violates
any
sense
of
fairness
of
due
process.
the
defendant
told
congress
that
he
needed
that
to
make
the
--
voter
uniformly
construed.
but
he
has
the
right
in
the
united
states
district
court
across
the
country.
it
would
be
no
uniformity
of
the
interpretation
of
anything.
why
in
the
world
bar
the
people
from
access
to
reasonably
accessible
course?
this
is
just
--
this
is
completely
unnecessary
and
it
cannot
be
considered
appropriate.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it's
to
suspend.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
was
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it's
unquestionably,
within
the
five
years,
we
could
reinstate
the
test
which
your
dealers
affirmed
down
the
road.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
not,
but
there's
nothing
in
all
process
as
to
strike,
as
i
see
it.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
but
it
contains
no
--
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
we've
say
we
have
no
remedy.
in
other
words,
if
we
went
to
the
district
court
today
the
people
that
we've
been
registering
since
august
we're
stuck
with.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
have
no
right
under
this
bill
to
take
them
off
the
road.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
the
finding,
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
the
only
finding
that
he
makes
is
that
a
literacy
test
exists.
this
is
just
the
question
of
reading
the
state
law.
he
makes
no
finding
that
it
has
been
abused.
he
makes
no
finding
that
it
has
been
used
for
racial
discrimination.
his
only
finding
is
strictly
automatic.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that
a
literacy
test
does
exist
in
these
states.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
this
is
my
understanding
of
the
mechanic,
yes
sir.
let
me
--
even
if
congress
can
do
that,
what
you
have
just
described,
this
brings
me
of
what
i
think
is
the
most
basic
objection
to
this
section.
the
fifteenth
amendment
power
is
the
power
to
enforce
by
legislature.
we
submit
that
this
section
constitute
a
congressional
adjudication,
they
are
not
legislations.
as
we
understand
that
the
constitutional
separation
of
powers,
congress
may
define
characteristics
of
people
or
things
and
say
--
and
this
definition
is
necessarily
based
upon
past
conduct.
we
define
these
characteristics,
anyone
who
falls
into
this
class
in
the
future
who
has
these
characteristics
are
subject
to
certain
rules;
this
is
rules
for
the
future.
on
the
other
hand,
adjudication
says
because
of
past
conduct.
you
people
before
us,
you
people
before
the
court,
and
you
only,
are
subject
to
certain
rules
in
the
future.
that's
the
difference,
as
i
understand
it
between
legislation
and
adjudication,
now
what
do
we
got
here?
congress
has
said,
that
the
existence
of
a
low
vote
and
the
existence
of
a
literacy
test,
indicate
a
danger
of
racial
discrimination,
but
not
general
and
not
hereafter,
but
only
in
1964.
if
in
1968,
massachusetts,
with
the
literacy
test,
voted
40%
of
its
total
population
over
21,
it
does
not
lose
its
laws.
if
texas,
who
only
voted
44%
in
1964,
adopts
a
literacy
test
today
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
and
only
vote
44%
in
1968,
it
does
not
lose
its
law.
it
does
not
have
its
legislature
suspended.
this
is
adjudication.
what
congress
had
said
here
is
only
for
you
certain
people
at
this
time
and
nobody
else
ever
again
can
these
two
factors
cause
the
loss
of
laws
in
the
suspension
of
legislature.
and
let's
look
it
even
further,
how
they
completed
the
adjudication.
this
court
said
time
and
time
again,
while
congress
can
define
classification,
the
courts
ultimately
must
decide
who
falls
into
that
classification.
the
congress
has
deprived
us
of
the
right
to
contest
the
certificates
of
the
bureau
of
census
or
the
attorney
general.
they've
not
only
by
picking
this
formula
which
the
defendant
testified
was
picked
because
of
who
it
covered.
by
picking
this
formula,
they've
not
only
completed
who's
covered
but
they
said
you
can't
have
a
contested
coverage
and
it
never
applies
to
anybody
else
again.
now,
if
congress
can
do
this
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
existence
of
a
low
vote
and
the
existence
of
a
literacy
test,
if
that's
evidence
of
racial
discrimination,
it's
got
to
be
evidenced
of
racial
discrimination
in
1968
and
1972
and
1976.
congress
cannot
pick
out
a
few
things
and
say
because
these
facts
existed
only
you
and
you.
this
is
what
they
have
done
and
this
is
really
problems
of
the
most
basic
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
think
that's
adjudication.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
adjudication.
congress
has
held
a
hearing,
they've
taken
the
test
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i'd
still
say
its
adjudication.
a
legislative
function
does
not
include
the
right
to
put
a
penalty
on
one
person
or
one
group
and
one
group
only.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
but
this
--
it
can't
do
this.
so
it's
closed
the
place,
if
it
does
that.
it
have
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
right.
and
they
can
define
what
it
shooting
at
and
it
could
such
assuming
that
we're
wrong
as
we've
gotten
after
this
one.
assuming
it
could
say
that
where
there's
a
low
vote
and
where
there's
illiteracy
test
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
--
that's
the
evidence
of
discrimination
and
you
lose
your
literacy.
assuming
it
could
say
that,
it's
got
to
say
it
to
everybody.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
because
if
it
doesn't,
it's
adjudicating.
and
the
powers
are
separated
in
our
constitution,
this
court
and
the
judiciary
are
the
only
one
who
can
exercise
a
judicial
function,
and
that
is
adjudication.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
we
deny.
that's
not
our
point.
we
assume
--
assume
that
it
could.
it
can't
do
it
this
way.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
do
not.
i
think
that
the
enforcement
power
like
the
policeman
cannot
write
a
law
and
the
policeman's
only
power
is
to
go
and
stop
the
crime
when
it's
being
committed.
i
think
that's
what
enforcement
power
is.
i
think
this
was
the
distinction
mr.
justice
bradley
made
in
the
civil
rights
cases
in
james
against
bowman
and
so
on.
these
are
what
these
cases
say
but
even
if
you
assume
that
congress
could,
even
assume
i'm
wrong
on
that,
congress
cannot
adjudicate.
it's
got
to
prescribe
a
set
of
laws
that
applied
to
everybody
from
now
on.
if
texas
or
massachusetts
votes
low
in
1968,
it's
got
to
come
on
in
and
join
this
category.
otherwise,
congress
is
adjudicating.
it's
hearing
certain
parties.
it's
taking
testimony.
it's
drawing
inferences
and
it
gives
you
a
five-year
sentence
with
a
parole.
you'd
come
to
washington
if
you
get
paroled.
this
is
about
what
this
thing
amounts
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
it
probably
would
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
i
think
that
--
would
the
state
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
there
you've
got
it
more
into
an
equal
protection
situation
with
the
state.
we're
talking
about
here
of
the
constitution
that
specifically
separates
these
powers,
article
i,
ii
and
iii
or
just
as
clear
as
they
could
be.
and
we're
talking
about
here
and
the
bill
of
attainder
comes
in.
but
i
don't
even
think
that
attainder
is
necessary.
i
think
we
have
punishment
here
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
in
our
position.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
don't
cite
any
section
that
says
that.
what
we
say
is
that
congress
must
define
things
in
terms
which
permit
anybody
in
the
future
that
possesses
those
characteristics
to
come
into
class
or
get
out
of
illusions
of
this
category.
when
you
close
the
class,
this
is
what
you
do
with
the
court,
you
only
rule
this
to
the
parties
before
the
court
or
the
groups
and
you
only
prescribe
rules
for
them
through
judgments
or
injunctions
in
the
future.
this
is
what
a
court
does.
this
is
what
congress
is
doing
if
it
says
your
state
now
and
nobody
ever
again.
and
this
is
what
we
say
on
the
article
iii
and
article
i,
congress
just
cannot.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
think
it
would
but
singling
out
a
given
few,
they
are
in
effect
adjudicated.
based
on
the
testimony
that
they've
heard
solely
and
maybe
they're
right,
maybe
congress
is
right.
but
it's
the
exercise
of
a
judicial
function
to
put
these
states
in
and
close
the
class
is
what
we
say.
now,
we
don't
think
that
congress
--
by
closing
the
class
now,
what
they're
saying
is
this
thing
can
occur
anywhere
else.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
of
course
this
is
true,
your
honor.
that
only
the
states
that
have
those
two
factors,
low
vote
and
literacy
test,
are
covered.
we're
not
--
i'm
not
saying
there's
anything
wrong
with
that.
i'm
saying
on
this
part
and
i
think
if
you
say
this
and
this
only
then
you
get
into
an
arbitrary
problem
because
congress
is
not
covering
areas
where
there
is
discrimination
otherwise.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
by
defining
these
factors,
congress
can't
say
that
we
only
apply
these
factors
today.
this
is
my
--
this
then
closes
the
class
and
adjudicates
those
people
and
those
people
alone.
i
think
congress
possibly
could
say.of
course,
our
position
is
to
the
contrary
but
it
could
say
these
are
bad
factors.
you
people
have
got
them
today,
we
apply
them
to
you.
but
it's
like
all
legislation
it
continues
and
it
should
continue,
and
if
the
situation
occurs
in
texas
or
in
arkansas
and
they
adopt
the
literacy
test,
why
shouldn't
they
fall
on
it
too?
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
other
procedures
nationwide
but
these
things
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
the
basic
and
i
don't
--
the
basic
difference
is
that
by
using
these
tests
themselves,
by
not
making
them
continue.
this
shows
that
congress
has
adjudicated
those
states.
this
is
--
by
just
saying,
we'll
--
this
is
what
the
court
does,
we
bring
in
and
look
at
the
evidence
here
and
there,
just
for
you.
and
this
is
what
congress
has
done.
this
is
adjudication.
if
they
had
said
generally,
if
they
had
said
generally,
that
would
be
legislation
but
they
have
taken
testimony.
they've
heard
the
evidence.
they
said,
“okay
just
you
and
now
and
now
only.”
this
is
something
only
a
court
can
do,
we
submit,
and
south
carolina
has
no
court
ever,
anyone
has
said
that
we've
used
our
literacy
requirements
to
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
race.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it
would.
i
think
it
would.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
it
does.
i
think
it's
--
well
what
my
argument
is
that
that
shows
it's
not
legislation.
but
i
think
if
they
had
setup
a
continuing
category,
i
think
that
--
that
would
be
legislation
and
i
wouldn't
agree
that
that's
constitution.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
right.
that
shows
--
that's
what
shows
it's
not
legislation.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
the
fact
that
it's
tied
to
one
point
in
time,
november
1,
1964.
i
mean,
i
think
that
congress
have
said
whenever
--
in
any
presidential
election,
you
vote
like
this,
this
is
the
danger,
that
would
be
legislation.
now,
whether
it
would
be
a
bad
legislation
it's
not
there.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
in
conclusion,
in
preparation
of
this
oral
argument,
attorney
general
mcleod
told
one
authority,
in
my
attention
i'd
like
to
read
to
you,
if
i
might
--
if
i
could.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
he
has
forbidden
his
governors
to
pass
laws
of
immediate
and
present
importance
unless
suspended
in
their
operation
until
his
ascent
should
be
obtained.
and
the
document
continues
that
his
sponsored
legislation,
“for
transporting
us
beyond
seas
to
be
tried
for
pretended
offenses;
for
taking
away
our
charters,
for
abolishing
our
most
valuable
laws
and
altering
fundamentally
the
forms
of
our
governments;
for
suspending
our
own
legislatures”
and
it
continues.
these
passages
as
you
gentlemen
recognized
it
from
the
declaration
of
independence.
and
it'd
be
quick
to
say
that
south
carolina
is
not
about
to
see,
we've
tried
that
once
and
we're
not
going
to
--
but
i've
called
these
passages
to
your
attention,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
showing
that
this
bill
of
particulars
contained
fundamental
reasons
why
our
union
was
born
to
prevent
such
use
of
central
authority
to
do
the
kind
of
things
that
are
enumerated
in
there.
this
document
was
signed
by
south
carolina
a
190
years
ago
was
back
here
today
with
similar
objections
to
similar
use
of
central
authorities,
suspending
legislatures,
knocking
down
local
voter
qualifications.
now,
we
have
not
come
to
you
lightly
in
the
first
instance.
we
knew
of
overwhelming
national
concern
to
see
that
the
negro
is
given
complete
equality
in
american
life
today.
we
fully
understand
that.
we
know
the
administration.
we
know
your
concern
and
if
--
we
don't
object
to
that
concern.
all
we
are
saying
here
today
is
that
the
solution,
the
remedy,
the
solution
to
this
problem
like
the
solution
to
any
problem
has
got
to
square
with
the
command
of
the
constitution.
we
think
this
problem
can
be
solved
by
congressional
legislation
but
not
to
these
sections.
the
remedy
does
not
square
with
basic
constitutional
command,
this
is
our
position.
and
we
are
here
in
the
first
instance
before
you,
with
the
fundamental
belief
that
the
citizens
of
south
carolina
are
entitled
to
the
same
protections
against
the
use
of
that
central
authority
in
such
a
way
as
the
citizens
of
any
other
state
in
the
union.we
appreciate
your
courteous
attention.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
had
arranged
for
attorney
general
mccloud
to
make
the
reply
argument
in
behalf
of
south
carolina.
