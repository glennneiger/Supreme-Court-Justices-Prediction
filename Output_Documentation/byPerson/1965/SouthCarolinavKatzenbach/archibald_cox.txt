mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
concentrate
my
argument
upon
our
submission
that
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act,
requiring
the
suspension
under
certain
circumstances
of
literacy
tests
and
other
tests
and
devices
defined
in
section
4
(b)
are
valid
exercise
of
the
power
conferred
on
the
congress
by
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
to
enact
appropriate
legislation
for
the
enforcement
of
section
1.
initially,
we
rest
upon
five
propositions
that
seem
to
us
to
sustain
the
great
bulk
of
this
statute.
first,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
is
concerned
with
the
suspension
of
literacy
test
and
other
tests
and
devices
only
in
circumstances
where
they're
used
in
the
judgment
of
congress,
carries
undue
danger
of
racial
discrimination
in
their
application,
resulting
in
the
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
on
grounds
of
race
or
color.
i
think
there's
a
very
important
distinction
here
that
i'd
like
to
emphasize.
a
literacy
test
may
bear
harder
on
a
particular
race
or
class
in
either
of
two
ways.
it
may
bear
harder
upon
negroes,
it
was
suggested
during
the
consideration
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
because
most
of
them
are
illiterate
as
was
the
case
at
that
time.
it
may
also
bear
harder
upon
negroes
for
a
quite
different
reason
that
it
is
administered
in
a
discriminatory
fashion.
so
that
same
test
is
not
given
to
them
as
it's
given
to
whites
or
so
that
a
test
is
given
to
them
and
no
test
is
given
to
whites.
and
it
is
that
latter
kind
of
discrimination
with
which
this
statute
is
concerned,
and
that
kind
of
discrimination
was
never
mentioned
in
the
debates
on
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
was
concerned
only
with
the
lack
of
literacy
as
such.
here,
we're
concerned
to
repeat
with
discriminatory
application
on
such
consistent
discriminatory
application
as
i
argued
last
year
in
united
states
against
mississippi
that
it
really
has
been
read
in
to
the
state
law
itself.
second,
the
authority
given
to
congress
to
enact
enforcement
legislation,
we
say,
carries
the
power
to
forbid
where
it's
necessary
to
do
enforcement
any
state
activities
which
present
danger
of
continued
violations
without
waiting
for
the
wrong
to
occur.
now,
it's
conceded
here
as
i
understood
mr.
robinson's
argument,
and
quite
rightly
so,
that
congress
under
other
sections
of
this
stat
--
constitution
has
power
to
deal
with
what
it
considers
potential
if
not
actual
sources
of
evil
as
the
court
said
in
one
occasion
or
that
it
may
enact
preventive
or
prophylactic
measures
outlawing
to
remove
tempting
opportunities,
a
rather
apt
description
i
may
say
in
these
tests.
the
argument
is
that
where
congress
is
acting
under
one
of
the
powers
given
in
article
1,
it
may
regulate
that
here,
but
here
it
may
only
enforce,
but
that
argument
is
contrary
to
our
whole
constitutional
history
as
far
back
as
prigg
against
pennsylvania
before
the
civil
war
described
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart
said
that
wherever
there
was
a
right
given
by
the
constitution
then
congress
had
power
to
enact
appropriate
legislation
to
enforce
it
and
that
has
been
the
way
the
constitution
has
been
applied
consistently.
for
example,
section
2
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
gives
power
to
congress
in
the
same
words
as
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
to
enact
appropriate
legislation
for
the
enforcement
of
that
article,
and
of
course
the
court
repeatedly
upheld
and
the
lower
courts
repeatedly
upheld
regulatory
measures
that
did
more
than
simply
deal
with
adjudicated
violations
of
the
statute
itself,
but
which
swept
in
that,
broad
enough
to
deal
with
the
dangers
of
violation.
and
these
things
were
recognized
in
the
early
cases
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment.
perhaps
the
clearest
expression
was
that
by
mr.
justice
bradley
in
united
states
against
cruikshank
when
he
was
sitting
on
the
circuit.
there
he
used
words,
which
flatly
repudiate
mr.
robinson's
distinction
between
enforcement
and
regulation.
the
method
of
enforcement,
he
said,
or
the
legislation
appropriate
to
that
end
will
depend
upon
the
character
of
the
right
to
infer.
it
maybe
by
the
establishment
of
regulations
for
attaining
the
object
of
the
right.
there
he
used
the
very
word
regulation
as
something
that
could
be
done
in
enacting
enforcement
legislation.
and
again,
in
strauder
against
west
virginia
quoting
from
the
earlier
case
of
united
states
against
reese
this
court
said,
“rights
and
immunities
created
by
or
dependent
upon
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
can
be
protected
by
congress.
the
fault
and
manner
of
the
protection
maybe
such
as
congress
in
the
legitimate
exercise
of
its
legislative
discretion
shall
provide.”
i
would
emphasize
one
more
case
ex
parte
virginia.
“whatever
legislation
is
appropriate
that
is
adopted
to
carry
out
the
objects,
the
amendments
having
viewed,
whatever
tends
to
enforce
submission
of
the
prohibition
they
contain
is
brought
within
the
domain
of
congressional
power.”
now
that
language
of
course
is
very
reminiscent
of
the
famous
language
by
mr.
justice
marshall
in
mcculloch
against
maryland.
in
fact,
it
must
have
been
written
with
the
language
in
mcculloch
against
maryland
in
mind,
if
not
actually
in
the
front
of
the
authors
who
copied
it.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
to
come
back
to
the
distinction
i
emphasized
in
connection
with
my
first
point,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
here
with
respect
to
literacy
test
which
would
operate
in
such
a
way
as
to
disqualify
more
negroes
than
whites
that
curtails
the
power
of
congress
to
deal
with
literacy
test
and
other
tests
and
devices
which
have
built
into
them
engines
of
discrimination
because
of
the
way
they
are
applied
unevenly.
it's
just
as
if
in
mr.
justice
white's
examples
during
the
course
of
the
argument
that
they
had
enacted
a
literacy
test
for
negroes
and
not
for
whites
or
a
different
literacy
test
for
negroes
and
not
for
whites
and
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
suggests
that
that
was
permissible.
our
third
point
is
that
congress
may
act
selectively.
it's
not
bound
to
deal
in
a
single
statute
with
every
aspect
of
the
evil
and
i
would
say
that
this
statute
in
an
answer
to
a
question
that
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas
does
deal
selectively
with
the
problem
and
that
this
of
course
is
a
familiar
legislative
power.
there
are
other
statutes
dealing
with
the
overall
problem
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
this
statute
deals
with
the
problem
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
and
we
suggest
that
both
with
respect
to
procedure
and
with
respect
to
error,
congress
could
operate
selectively
in
such
a
way
as
to
deal
with
the
situation
where
the
evil
was
seemingly
greatest
and
where
the
particular
remedy
provided
was
seemingly
the
best,
the
most
appropriate
and
that
is,
i
insist,
a
legislative
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
ultimately
a
constitutional
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
has
to
decide
ultimately
whether
this
is
within
the
power
given
to
congress
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
judgment
of
appropriateness,
it
would
seem
to
me,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
essentially
one
for
congress
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
use
the
word
section.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
recall.
let's
assume
it
does.
mr.
archibald
cox
just
wyoming.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
did
not
mean
to
indicate
that
whatever
congress
did
could
be
said
to
be
appropriate.
there
comes
a
point
to
a
judicial
judgment.
there
have
been
historically
difference
within
the
court
as
to
how
much
judicial
judgment
should
be
exercised.
i
was
seeking
to
avoid
being
drawn
into
them
because
i
think
this
statute
is
well
within
that
area
whichever
degree
of
scrutiny
the
court
applies
to
the
legislation,
but
i
agree
that
ultimately,
there
are
some
judicial
--
appropriate
judicial
determination
as
to
whether
the
means
is
adapted
to
the
end,
yes
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
correct,
i
agree
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
entirely
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
yes.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
anything
inconsistent
with
that.
i
did
mean
to
suggest
that
in
determining
what
was
appropriate
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
congress
had
a
very
wide
area
of
judgment
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
conversely,
that
the
court
has
an
obligation
to
defer
very
widely
to
that
judgment.
i
also
meant
to
imply
that
of
course
this
is
not
a
matter
of
reviewing
the
findings
made
on
the
record
by
an
administrative
agency.
here,
we're
dealing
with
an
area
in
which
i
suppose
no
group
of
man
has
as
much
knowledge
and
as
much
personal
experience,
the
basis
of
which
to
form
their
judgment
as
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
we're
dealing
with
voting
matters
with
elections,
with
registration,
things
that
they've
made,
they
do
it.
my
fourth
proposition
and
i
want
to
emphasize
it,
is
that
congress
made
the
dominant
and
ultimate
test
of
the
requirement
for
suspension
because
of
the
danger
of
violation,
a
judicial
determination
of
whether
a
state
or
a
county
had
used
literacy
test
or
other
test
or
device
as
an
engine
of
discrimination
in
the
past
and
i
would
emphasize
that
that
dominant
test
applies
everywhere
to
every
state
and
every
county
in
the
united
states.
there
is
no
difference
between
them.
section
3
(b)
printed
on
page
90
of
the
government's
brief,
very
specifically
provides
that
when
the
attorney
general
has
brought
a
proceeding
in
any
state,
if
the
court
finds
that
the
test
or
device
has
been
used
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
violating
the
fifteenth
amendment,
then
it
shall
suspend
the
use
of
test
and
device
in
such
state
or
political
subdivision.
that's
uniform.
it
applies
everywhere,
but
the
dominant
test
of
course
even
to
those
states
or
counties
under
section
4
is
the
same
one,
a
judicial
inquiry
into
whether
a
test
or
device
has
or
has
not
been
used
in
such
a
way
as
to
result
in
violations
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
there
are
no
differences
between
those
under
3
(b)
and
those
under
section
4,
but
the
dominant
ultimate
test
in
each
case
is
the
same
and
if
there
is
any
state
represented
here
in
the
courtroom
today
that
has
not
used
the
test
or
device
to
violate
fifteenth
amendment
or
whose
officials
have
not
so
done,
all
it
has
to
do
is
to
go
in
to
court
and
show
it.
they
could
have
been
if
this
is
true
in
south
carolina
or
virginia.
they
could
have
filed
a
suit
in
september.
they'd
be
well
away
to
a
decision
now
if
assertions
are
true,
perhaps
it
would
have
had
the
decision
in
the
lower
court.
they
are
created
equally
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
test.
this
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
as
at
the
time
that
the
violation
had
occurred,
it
is
five
years
from
when
it
was
used
--
mr.
archibald
cox
from
the
violation
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
also
true
with
respect
to
examiners.
there's
a
provision
for
the
appointment
of
examiners
by
the
court
when
a
finding
that
a
test
has
been
used
to
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
made,
and
equally,
the
power
to
appoint
examiner's
falls,
if
a
state
makes
each
case
under
section
4
(a),
there's
no
great
difference
in
the
long
run
in
other
words
with
respect
to
the
way
the
states
are
treated.
now,
fifth
i
suggest,
that
the
propriety
of
suspending
a
test
or
device
where
there
is
that
kind
of
judicial
determination
that
has
been
used
as
an
engine
of
racial
discrimination
is
sustained
squarely
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
at
the
mississippi
and
louisiana
cases
decided
last
term.
some
of
my
friends
attempted
to
distinguish
the
louisiana
case
on
the
ground
that
that
was
a
suspension
only
pending
a
full
registration.
it
covers
only
one
of
the
statutes.
there
were
other
tests
or
devices
in
louisiana
that
were
fully
suspended
and
of
course
that
was
the
theory
of
the
government's
case
in
united
states
against
mississippi.
i
may
say
in
this
connection
too
that
it
seems
to
me
that
those
cases
implicitly
sustain
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
legislation,
dealing
with
perspective
violation
in
the
future
because
of
course
the
only
reason
that
equity
court
is
concerned
with
violations
in
the
past
is
because
of
what
they
show
with
respect
to
the
future.
it's
not
a
punishment.
it's
a
way
of
dealing
with
the
danger
not
the
actuality,
the
danger
of
perspective
violation
and
where
did
the
court's
power
come
from
those
cases
to
issue
that
kind
of
decree.
i
take
it
that
it
came
from
congress,
from
the
power
granted
by
congress
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
appropriate
legislation
because
when
congress
gave
the
courts
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
kind
of
case
under
the
57th
and
60
civil
rights
act,
it
impliedly
gave
the
courts
the
usual
powers
enacted
the
court,
but
the
ultimate
source,
i
suggest,
with
all
sincerity
would
seem
to
be
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
not
some
inherent
power
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution
which
is
unrelated
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
if
these
propositions
are
sound,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
scarcely
open
to
serious
debate,
then
the
essential
thrust
of
the
act
is
certainly
constitutional.
now
the
argument
really
comes
down
to
the
significance
given
by
the
statute
to
the
determinations
made
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
census.
under
the
statute,
they
are
the
measures
which
congress
desired
to
be
used
for
determining
where
and
when
the
use
of
a
test
or
device
carry
sufficient
danger
of
discrimination
to
warrant
two
or
three
consequences.
one
consequence
which
it
attached
to
those
determinations
was
the
immediate
suspension
of
the
test
or
device,
pending
full
judicial
inquiries
and
nothing
more.
second,
requiring
the
state
or
county
as
to
which
the
determinations
have
been
made
to
establish
its
right
to
an
exemption
from
the
prohibition
and
only
that
and
then
third,
it
opened
the
door
to
the
immediate
appointment
of
examiners,
but
again
the
power
that
was
only
interim,
awaiting
and
which
would
fall
if
the
state
established
its
right
to
an
exemption
under
the
judicial
proceedings
authorized
to
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
question
then
comes
down
simply
to
this,
whether
the
somewhat
different
consequences
that
congress
attached
to
the
making
of
these
determinations
under
somewhat
different
consequences
they
would
have
in
one
set
of
state
and
counties
as
applied
to
another
is
reasonably
adopted
to
the
prevention
of
violations
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
in
appraising
the
significance
of
that
provision
that
must
also
take
into
account
the
provisions
of
section
4
(d)
which
define
when
a
test
or
device
shall
be
deemed
to
have
been
used
for
the
purpose
of
the
effect.
that
it
very
substantially,
should
i
say,
ameliorate,
soften
what
might
otherwise
seemed
to
be
the
rigor
of
the
five-year
test
because
it
indicates
that
small
occasional
violations,
things
that
were
quickly
corrected
and
the
like
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
of
sufficient
importance
to
require
a
judgment
against
the
state.
and
i
take
it
the
court
in
reading
those
and
then
applying
them
would
bear
in
mind
what
is
the
fundamental
question?
has
the
state
conduct
in
the
past
shown
enough
likelihood
that
this
test
will
be
used
as
an
abuse
in
the
future
or
to
warrant
it's
disestablishment.
now,
congress
indicated
they
didn't
--
it
had
a
full
round
with
this
i
think
that
there
had
been
enough
violation
and
there
was
enough
importance
in
securing
compliance
now
that
to
require
a
very
high
degree
of
proof,
but
nevertheless
the
essential
theory
of
the
act
remains
what
i've
explained
and
the
court
in
interpreting
this
exact
words
would
certainly
take
that
into
account.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
--
that's
right
and
i'd
answer
your
question
this
way
if
i
may
try
to
put
it
in
the
context
of
the
argument.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
accepting
the
proposition,
it
was
put
in
the
form
of
question
and
i
just
state
it
that
way
for
convenience,
that
congress
did
say,
“well,
let's
outlaw
literacy
test
in
virginia
and
nowhere
else.”
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
--
if
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
virginia
from
other
state,
if
indeed
everything
that
can
be
suggested
is
that
virginia
is
quite
as
bad
as
another
state.
it
would
--
i
would
feel
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
that
was
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
even
though
there
is
certainly
no
specific
provision
in
the
constitution
that
it
would
violate
and
i
think
therefore
in
finding
that
this
is
legislation
before
it
can
find
that
this
is
legislation
reasonably
adapted
to
enforcing
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
the
court
must
find
that
these
different
procedures
have
some
rational
relationship
to
achieving
that
objective
in
places
where
the
problems
are
somewhat
different.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
these
i
think,
the
november
--
you
mean
because
it
was
passed
or
just
[inaudible]
effort?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
your
concern
with
the
choice
of
that
date
is
only
where
the
congress
could
within
its
legislative
judgment
rationally
conclude
that
low
participation
in
voting
as
shown
by
that
election
has
some
bearing
on
the
need
for
immediate
interim
suspension
of
the
test
and
immediate
interim
power
to
appoint
examiners.
now
as
--
mr.
archibald
cox
(voice
overlap)
congress
studied
a
lot
of
figures
that
certainly
it's
not
for
the
court
to
decide
which
figures
are
better
than
any
other
figures.
i
am
convinced
from
what
i
know
of
the
facts,
including
the
records
before
congress,
that
there
were
very
good
reasons
for
choosing
that
date
in
general.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
it's
perfect
in
any
instance.
for
example,
registration
figures
perhaps
would
be
better,
if
what
had
accurate
registration
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
obviously
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
i
understood
him
--
don't
let
me
put
words
in
his
mouth.
i
would
have
submitted
the
proposition
a
little
differently.
suppose
that
you
and
i
were
trying
to
develop
a
test
for
determining
which
barrels
of
apples
were
rotten,
we
didn't
know
what
was
in
there,
we
do
something
about
some
barrels.
now,
if
somebody
put
forward
a
test
for
determining
which
are
rotten
and
we
knew
that
it
left
one
barrel
that
we
knew
to
be
rotten
outside
the
test,
we'd
reject
that
test.
we'd
say
it
isn't
a
very
good
test
and
we
would
come
to
it,
we
would
seek
to
devise
a
test
as
we
worked
along
that
conformed
to
what
we
did
know.
in
the
case
of
the
state
like
virginia,
we
just
didn't
know.
we
have
many
things
fighting
in
the
direction
of
the
conclusion
that
the
literacy
test
in
virginia
was
used
to
discriminate.
whether
that
is
the
fact,
i
don't
know
but
there
are
--
i'm
not
talking
about
record
evidence,
i'm
talking
about
inferences
from
general
conditions
including
discrimination
in
the
application
and
the
administration
of
the
poll
tax
and
the
lot
history
of
discrimination
there.
the
low
participation
in
voting,
all
those
things
tend
toward
the
conclusion
that
there
has
been
discrimination.
they're
not
perfect
to
the
court,
but
the
best
figures
after
congress
scrutinize,
primary
figures,
registration
figures
and
others
seemed
to
be
participation
in
the
general
election.
registration
figures
are
mr.
justice,
are
of
no
value
at
all.
if
you
look
through
this
record
you'll
find
eight
or
nine
counties
in
south
carolina
where
the
number
of
illiterates
plus
the
number
of
people
registered
are
way
above
the
population.
it
--
and
you'll
find
that
counties
in
alabama
and
mississippi
as
congress
looked
in
which
more
than
a
100%
of
the
population
was
registered.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
reason
of
course
is
this
is
not
perfectly
practical
one
that
polls
aren't
--
the
registration
list
don't
have
the
names
of
people
who
are
dead
and
so
forth
(voice
overlap)
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
you
can
so
easily
be
satisfied
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
it's
the
word
of
rational
inference
the
case
would
be
much
harder,
yes
mr.
justice,
much
harder.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
of
course
--
but
mr.
justice,
i
would
suggest
that
the
problem
isn't
that
of
inferring
the
discrimination
from
the
low
vote
taken
in
a
vacuum.
it's
the
problem
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
don't
have
to
be
concerned
with
the
rationality
of
the
evidence
taken
in
a
vacuum,
yes,
it's
quite
true
because
there's
every
--
all
kinds
of
things
in
our
history,
all
kinds
of
things
in
the
record
before
congress
that
did
show
that
the
low
vote
coincided
with
all
low
vote
plus
the
existence
of
test
and
device
coincided
in
all
probability,
not
certainty,
probability
with
the
likelihood
that
there
was
abuse
of
the
test
or
devices
in
the
sense
that
i've
stated.
in
the
counties
and
states
that
that
those
areas
that
this
is
all
of
our
history
as
mr.
justice
black
said.
it's
not
about
our
logical
deductions
simply
from
that
one
fact
alone
that
congress
was
able
to
test
the
yardsticks
back
against
what
to
do,
and
each
time
it
tested
them,
it
coincided
more
and
more
with
the
facts
of
discrimination
in
the
past.
i'd
like
to
say
two
final
things.
what
is
that
fact
that
the
measure
used
by
congress,
the
net
put
out
by
congress
sweeps
a
little
bit
widely
that
the
actual
evils
of
course
is
not
fatal
to
what
constitutional
laws
frequently
deal
in
terms
of
probabilities
and
they
sweep
within
their
bounds
on
some
things
which
may
never
end
up
as
the
case
of
that
--
the
evil.
here,
congress
attempted
to
--
had
been
mitigate
any
evil
with
respect
to
the,
perhaps,
excessive
broadness
of
the
initial
test
by
providing
a
way
as
i've
said
before
that
any
state
could
come
in
and
say
that
the
conclusions
we've
decided
would
follow
upon
this
fact
don't,
don't
follow.
and
they
said
that
any
state
could
come
forward
and
prove
that
it
didn't
discriminate,
but
second
with
respect
to
section
5,
i
would
just
like
to
mention
one
fact
that
seems
to
me
very
pertinent
to
support
the
validity
of
section
5,
prohibiting
changes
in
state
laws
and
prohibiting
--
putting
them
into
effect
until
it
has
been
found
by
the
attorney
general
or
a
court
that
they
will
have
neither
the
purpose
or
effect
of
resulting
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
of
course
many
of
these
states,
most
of
these
states
as
congress
knew
had
gone
from
one
device
for
violating
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
another
device
for
violating
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
the
record
in
the
mississippi
case
last
year
that
your
honors
will
find
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
government
last
year,
shows
how
mississippi
came
along
with
one
lie
after
another
in
an
effort
to
delay
putting
the
fifteenth
amendment
into
effect.
the
same
thing
was
done
in
many
of
these
states,
if
not
all
of
these
states,
but
it
came
to
complying
with
this
court's
ruling
in
the
school
segregation
case.
and
that
of
course
was
the
reason
that
the
prohibition
enacted
in
section
5
is
appropriate.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
understood
the
colloquy
here,
there
is
--
it's
very
doubtful
as
it
is
in
the
case
in
controversy
about
section
5.
we
ultimately
think
that
south
carolina
has
said
that
it
wants
to
do
--
let's
put
this
one
hour
change
with
respect
to
the
time
the
polls
are
open
to
the
registration
places
open
to
effect
that
the
attorney
general
says
that
he
doesn't
deny
their
right
to
do
it
under
the
statute
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
therefore
can
they
mr.
justice,
i
must
say
that
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
a
case
of
controversy
requiring
the
court's
adjudication.
on
the
other
hand,
while
my
connection
with
these
matters
is
now
getting
little
remote,
i
must
say
that
i
think
any
doubts
left
hanging
about
the
validity
of
section
5
would
be
most
unfortunate
in
terms
of
the
securing
the
right
guaranteed
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
in
the
near
future.
thank
you.
