justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
robinson,
you
have
no
complaint
about
the
louisiana
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
nothing
that
--
nothing
that
you
argue
is
inconsistent
with
the
louisiana
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
louisiana
case
is
inconsistent
or
it
doesn't
preclude
anything
that
you
argue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
cong
--
you
would
concede
them
that
congress
could've
done
just
what
the
court
did
there.
but
if
you
said
the
louisiana's
test
must
be
suspended
until
they
give
the
new
test
to
everybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think
that
--
you
don't
think
that
congress
could
have
done
what
the
court
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
it
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
could
--
we
listen
up
to
same
issues
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
take
that
what
you're
arguing
is
that
the
congress
can
only
as
it
in
--
in
enforcing
the
fifteenth
amendment,
order
or
make
a
crime
out
of
or
otherwise
preclude
or
forbid
states
from
discriminating
in
the
application
of
their
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
not,
you
say,
congress
may
not,
even
if
it
shows
that
the
test
has
consistently
been
discriminatorily
applied,
congress
may
not
even
in
those
events
suspend
the
operation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
a
court
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
you're
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
not,
but
the
court
do
it
in
louisiana.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
congress
can
by
legislation
attempt
to
prevent
the
use
of
literacy
test
as
engines
of
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
it
may
not
suspend
the
use
of
those
tests
even
where
it's
been
proven
that
the
test
has
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
supported.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
does
it
--
did
the
congress
say,
we're
going
to
suspend
it?
didn't
they
say
that
this
test
has
been
so
wrapped
up
with
discrimination
and
at
least
in
some
stage
that
it
ought
to
be
suspended
until
the
state
indicates
or
until
there's
been
some
showing
that
it's
no
longer
used
as
a
discriminatory
device?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
they
can't
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
involved
in
your
case,
in
your
--
what
would
--
what
did
the
attorney
general's
advanced
in
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
registering?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
voting
under
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
have
in
it
the
respective
percentages
of
whites
and
negroes
registered
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
in
virginia's
--
in
the
state
of
virginia's
brief,
they
have
some
figures
here
but
you
don't
--
that's
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
brief,
it
says
there
were
69%
of
your
white
folks
and
34%
of
your
negroes,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
--
the
provisions
of
section
4
(d),
doesn't
help
you
under
section
5,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
says
that
an
old
political
subdivision
will
be
determined
to
have
engaged
in
the
use
of
test
or
devices
that
the
incidence
had
been
few
in
number
and
so
on.
do
you
think
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
true
then
that
you
would
have
to
prove
that
you
couldn't
discriminate
just
a
single
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
you
would
have
to
be
--
you
don't
have
to
be
more
than
just
a
few
instances.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
this
provision
then
does
--
is
available
to
you
in
a
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
who
would
--
how
have
you
been
treated
differently
from
someone
or
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
because
of
the
--
that's
because
of
certain
set
of
facts
that
the
act
deals
with
this
in
your
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
doesn't
in
some
other
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
facts
are
as
you
stated
them
in
south
carolina
and
about
what
the
evidence
was
before
congress,
you
could
easily
win
your
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcilwaine,
let's
assume
that
a
particular
state,
let's
assume
virginia
passed
a
law
providing
for
a
literacy
test
for
negroes
and
provided
no
literacy
test
for
whites,
and
congress
then
passed
the
law
suspended
in
that
literacy
test.
would
congress
be
exceeding
its
powers
for
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
couldn't
have
the
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
could
it
apply,
could
--
well,
you
mean
it
could
itself
write
the
--
change
the
virginia
law,
one
way
or
the
other,
if
he
either
abolish
it
or
expand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
take
the
literacy
test
so
that
this
old
statute
said
that
it
--
this
literacy
test
applies
only
to
negroes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
consequently,
congress
could
have
passed
a
law
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
might
want
to
make
it
a
crime
or
someday
might
just
want
to
abolish
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
--
i
take
it
then
you
would
say
that
consistently
with
your
argument
that
congress
could
not
pass
the
law
suspending
the
operation
of
the
virginia
statute
which
applies
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
that
did
--
that
just
on
its
face
that
did
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
the
fifteenth.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
its
face.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
a
literacy
test
of
general
applicability
supposedly
that
one
that
is
discriminatorily
applied
regularly
that
that
would
violate
fifteenth
amendment
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
no
--
no,
no.
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
widespread
discrimination,
90%
of
the
eligible
people
wouldn't
be
voting.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
have
--
do
you
recall
whether
there
was
any
great
difference
between
the
vote
in
your
primary
and
in
your
general
election
in
1964?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
were
the
figures,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
both
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know.
so
you
--
but
your
80%
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
both
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
general,
what
percentage
voted
in
the
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
49.5
and
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
80%
that
you
--
that
80%
is
figured
the
way
you
figure
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
primary
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
figured
that
the
way
that
--
you're
the
--
but
you
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
it
be,
70
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
have
about
30
or
40
haven't
you
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that's
the
way
you
think
it
ought
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
determination
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
operation
of
the
triggering
devices
in
connection
with
alabama
that
alabama
registrars
could
under
any
current
instruction
of
this
act
ask
this
question
of
registrants.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
could
do
so
without
violating
this
act
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn't
take
any
new
legislation
in
alabama
either,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
--
would
it
be
violative
of
any
present
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
alabama
laws
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
registrars
simply
asked
this
question
of
regis
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
this
suggestion
is
not
--
isn't
a
brand
new
one
that
the
attorney
general
has
heard
about
it.
up
to
now,
does
he
indicate
what
his
position
is
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
ought
to
think
you
have
the
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
one
of
your
points
that
the
congress
had
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
discrimination
against
negroes
in
registering
in
the
state
of
georgia?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
did
this
evidence
include
use
of
literacy
test
in
a
discriminatory
manner
or
just
other
kinds
of
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
your
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
mr.
mcllwaine
yesterday?
what
--
what
would
be
your
answer
if
a
state
had
a
--
had
a
literacy
test,
but
by
its
terms,
the
test
was
applicable
only
to
negroes?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
a
--
could
congress
pass
a
law
of
--
have
the
power
to
pass
a
law
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
outlawing
that
statute,
by
striking
down
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
section
2
is
just
for
passage
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
let
me
ask
you
this
then
statute
--
the
statute
applied
--
the
state
stat
--
literacy
test
applies
generally
but
it's
uncontested
and
admitted
that
it's
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
it's
--
and
only
negroes
are
asked
to
pass
the
literacy
test
in
a
regist
--
by
the
registrar.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
congress
have
--
would
the
congress
have
power
to
do
anything
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
have
had
the
power
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
could
it
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
--
your
point
is
that
they
--
the
congress
could
not
suspend
the
operation
of
literacy
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
court
can
suspend
the
operation
of
the
test
entirely?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
accept
that
case,
are
you
in
agreement
with
the
results
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
although
a
court
may
do
it
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
the
congress
can't?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
question
here
be
any
different
if
instead
of
the
triggering
device,
the
congress
had
simply
named
certain
states
and
said
in
view
of
the
past
history,
literacy
test
provided
for
in
the
following
states
are
hereby
suspended
for
five
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
the
explanation
why
congress
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
indeed
the
non-legal
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
based
on
the
information
they
had,
they
knew
what
they
were
covering?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
intended
to
cover?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
maybe
that
--
maybe
that
somewhere
in
or
out
they
haven't
anticipated
that
based
on
the
information
they
had
then
they
knew
what
the
law
was
going
to
cover?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general
you
--
the
evidence
--
about
virginia,
there
was
no
evidence
you
say
in
the
hearings
concerning
the
actual
use
of
literacy
test
for
discriminatory
purposes.
was
there
evidence
that
--
affirmative
evidence
that
they
weren't
so
used,
or
did
the
united
states
in
these
hearings
concede
that
it
wasn't
used
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
had
there
been
any
suits
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
any
state
that
is
covered
by
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
precisely
that's
what
--
that's
--
can
you
find
a
rational
basis
for
the
exclusion
of
those
states
under
this
synthetic
device
that's
been
devised
by
congress.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
the
significance
of
the
low
vote
part
of
the
trigger
that
you
get
a
low
enough
vote
the
inferences
that
there's
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
when
there's
a
--
and
the
other
leg
is
that
the
--
did
the
low
vote
infers
discrimination
and
when
there's
a
literacy
test
or
some
other
device,
named
device
there
why
the
inferences
had
resulted
from
those
devices
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
maybe.
in
a
state
where
there's
a
low
vote
but
no
literacy
test,
do
you
think
there's
no
inference
of
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
agree
with
that,
i
agree
with
that.
but
--
and
so
the
low
vote
infers
discrimination
and
hence
the
--
just
as
much
in
texas
as
it
does
in
louisiana.
the
low
vote
infers
discrimination
from
something.
it
may
not
be
--
it
can't
be
literacy
test
because
there's
no
literacy
test.
so
what's
the
rational
basis
for
--
for
just
covering
on
your
own
statement
a
while
ago?
what's
the
rational
basis
for
covering
some
discrimination
and
not
other
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
agree
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
send
the
examiners
into
--
into
any
state
where
there's
discrimination
you
think
but
no
tests
and
devices?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
old
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
states
have
literacy
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
--
does
this
case
turn
on
the
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
do
we
have
to
really
decide
whether
the
rational
connection
between
a
low
vote
and
discrimination
by
the
--
in
the
application
of
literacy
test
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
we
have
to
decide
that
--
i
mean,
so
what
if
there
isn't
a
rational
connection?
the
congress
apparently
just
took
the
figures
in
1964
and
said
that
this
is
why
at
a
certain
stage
and
this
is
the
stage
that
you
wanted
to
apply
to.
do
we
take
that
or
do
we
really
have
to
say,
approach
that
this
is
a
testing
that
there
may
be
of
some
presumption
or
some
evidentiary
inference.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
this
is
the
way
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
congress
wrote
it
up,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
that
congress
had
--
that
the
actual
figures
that
it
did
one
year
was
an
80%
of
the
people
who
voted
in
a
primary
and
45%
voted
in
the
general
election,
1964
and
congress
said
since
50%
voted
in
the
general,
this
infers
discrimination
in
the
application
of
the
literacy
test
and
you
might
have
some
problems
about
the
rationality
in
--
80%
voted
in
the
primary
and
were
registered.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
the
attorney
general
from
louisiana
indicated
that
there
was
a
high
vote
in
the
primary
on
this
date
of
1964
that
despite
the
interest
of
the
general
election
that
there
was
a
much
lower
vote
in
the
--
in
the
general
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
those
figures
he
said
about
70%
or
80%
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
--
is
that
the
figure?
is
that
the
figure
66%?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently,
there's
nowhere
in
this
record
that
i
have
seen
the
actual
figures
for
1964
as
between
the
primary
and
the
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
south
carolina
didn't
input
their
figures
for
1964
in
their
sheet,
in
their
appendix
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
talking
about
section
5
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
talk
about
5,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
asked
–
[inaudible]
in
that
kind
of
piece
of
litigation
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
passes
a
new
law
and
he
can't
put
it
in
effect
and
it
comes
to
you
and
it
says
we're
not
doing
this
for
any
purpose
of
discrimination.
you
said,
we'll,
i
don't
know
about
that.
i'm
not
going
to
clear
it.
go
to
court.
and
they
go
to
court.
now,
who
--
who
ask
to
show
what
their
--
they
got
the
burden
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mississippi
has
got
a
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
–
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
only
thing
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
this
matter
in
a
vacuum.
you're
dealing
on
it
on
the
whole
record
and
i
just
--
the
congress
didn't
just
say,
well
now,
let's
see
--
should
we
--
is
there
some
discrimination
to
attend
to
or
maybe
there
is
and
maybe
there
isn't
and
so
we'll
set
up
--
we'll
device
the
best
test
we
could
think
of.
we'll
just
say
if
any
--
in
any
state
that
less
than
50%
voted
that
--
that's
to
us
and
that
evidence
of
discrimination.
that
isn't
the
way
it
happened
at
all.
they
had
much
other
evidence
about
--
about
various
states
and
if
we
have
to
consider
the
rationality
of
inferring
discrimination
of
a
low
vote
into
the
1964
general
election,
i
would
think
you
really
do
have
a
difficult
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
handler
what
if
the
only
evidence
before
the
congress
about
discriminatory
application
of
--
discrimination
against
negroes
in
registration
was
the
fact
--
where
there
were
two
facts,
one,
that
literacy
test
did
exist
in
some
states
and
two,
that
in
the
1964
election
in
several
states,
less
than
50%
voted.
now,
that's
the
only
evidence
congress
have
had
and
i
would
think
that
that's
all
the
evidence
the
congress
had.
they
wouldn't
have
passed
the
act
in
the
first
place,
but
in
the
second
place,
even
if
they
had,
what
would
you
think
is
the
terms
of
that
presumption
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
may
find
acceptable.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
this
is
hypothetical
in
terms
the
way
you
are
arguing
it,
do
you
find
the
presumption
itself
on
those
two
facts
to
be
acceptable
and
say
appropriate.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
acceptability
of
this
presumption
must
be
viewed
in
light
of
all
the
evidence
not
just
the
--
not
just
the
low
vote
in
1964.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
the
section
4
--
the
determination
under
section
4
is
made
that
there's
a
literacy
test
[inaudible]
that's
essential
for
general
elections,
you
say
that
[inaudible]
no
matter
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
the
state
is
otherwise
subject
to
adjudication
of
the
court,
the
state
should
come
in
immediately.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
make
the
case
to
be
exempted
from
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
primary

byron

[inaudible]
for
the
general
election.
justice
byron

[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
and
you
have
the
congressional
races.
justice
byron

justice

are
you
getting
this?
