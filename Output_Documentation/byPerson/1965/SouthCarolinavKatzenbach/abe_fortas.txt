justice
abe
fortas
mr.
robinson.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
as
i
read
section
4
(a),
what
would
happen
here
would
be
that
after
--
let
us
assume
that
the
court
had
not
decide
in
south
carolina's,
the
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
south
carolina
could
come
back
to
the
court
after
five
years
had
passed
but
not
before.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
when
the
statute
talks
as
i
think
it
does
in
terms
of
a
suspension,
i
suppose
that
one
must
leave
that
as
meaning
for
five
years
after
the
prior
administrative
action
has
been
taken
and
would
you
still
say
that
the
effect
of
the
legislation
is
to
abolish
or
to
suspend?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
would
--
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
rules
on
that
one
way
or
the
other,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
affect
that
question
one
way
or
the
other,
i'm
asking
for
information.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
--
alright,
may
i
ask
another
question.
do
i
understand
that
maybe
i
--
maybe
you
didn't
intend
to
say
this,
that
an
appropriate
--
if
an
appropriate
circumstances
and
by
appropriate
procedure,
there
were
inappropriate
finding,
whatever
that
might
mean,
that
there
was
consistent
maladministration
to
use
your
word,
who
do
not
challenge
the
power
of
congress
to
do
something
whatever
that
something
might
be.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
concede
that
congress
would
have
the
power.
the
next
question
is
this,
as
i
understand
this
law,
it
provides
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
must
make
a
finding,
it's
in
effect
an
administrative
finding.
that's
under
4
(b)
that
--
and
he
--
his
power
to
make
that
finding
is
limited
to
a
particular
category,
that
is
to
say
the
category
where
less
than
50%
of
the
persons
of
voting
age
were
registered,
et
cetera.
within
that
category,
he's
empowered
to
make
the
findings,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that,
you
start
off
here
with
a
finding
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
which
is
in
the
category
of
an
administrative
--
justice
abe
fortas
no?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
where
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
that
after
he
makes
that
finding
within
that
prescribed
category,
then
the
state
has
the
opportunity
under
the
statute
to
come
into
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
try
to
persuade
the
court
that
no
such
test
has
been
used
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
denying
or
breaching
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
is
that
--
do
i
correctly
understand
the
scheme?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
do
i
correctly
understand
then
that
it
is
your
position
that
this
statute
does
not
deal
with
all
of
the
problem
of
supposed
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
but
it
deals
with
a
part
of
the
problem
and
also
that
it's
your
position
that
the
congress
has
constitutional
power
to
deal
with
part
of
that
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
can
you
think
of
any
reciprocal
complaints
in
any
of
the
southern
states
might
have
with
respect
to
any
--
to
your
state.
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
it's
a
national
problem,
i
was
wondering
whether
the
southern
states
reciprocated
feelings
of
this
expressed
to
any
of
them
to
your
knowledge
think
that
any
of
the
customs
north
of
the
mason-dixon
line
are
objectionable.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
the
--
i
suppose
that
the
initial
question
is
whether
the
legislation
adapted
by
congress
has
as
its
purpose
the
object
stated
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
is
to
say
that
the
legislation
in
order
to
be
supported
by
the
second
sentence
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
to
have
a
rational
relationship
to
the
elimination
of
an
abridgment
of
voting
rights
on
account
of
race
or
color.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
agree?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
take
for
example
--
let's
suppose
that
congress
passed
a
law
fixing
voting
age
at
16
in
all
of
the
states
and
overriding
the
state's
special
law.
justice
abe
fortas
that
it
could
not
be
supported
presumably
under
the
second
sentence
of
the
fifth
--
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
it
has
to
have
a
relationship
to
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
congress
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cox,
may
i
ask
whether
you
consider
that
there's
another
question
here
in
the
court
actually
under
4
(a).
the
question
put
to
the
court
is
whether
any
of
such
test
or
device
has
been
used
during
the
five
years
preceding
filing
of
the
action
for
the
purpose
of
what
the
effect
would
bridge
in
right
to
vote
on
the
grounds
of
race
and
color.
and
i
suppose
that
theoretically
it
would
be
possible
to
argue
that
that
standard
is
so
limited
that
to
say
whether
the
test
or
device
has
been
used
during
the
four
years
as
to
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
it
does
properly
establish
a
situation
within
the
ambit
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
question
is
before
us
now.
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not
but
theoretically
that's
the
problem
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
(voice
overlap)
that
something
is
wrong.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
--
may
i
ask
your
help
on
this
question?
do
you
believe
that
we
must
pass
on
section
5
at
this
time
or
second
that
would
be
appropriate
to
not
to
pass
on
at
this
time.
do
you
have
a
judgment
on
that
mr.
cox?
