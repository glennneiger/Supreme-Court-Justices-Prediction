mr.
alan
b.
handler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
briefs
of
california
and
massachusetts
and
illinois
have
emphasized
among
other
things
the
[inaudible]
which
all
states
have
in
a
level
and
quality
of
political
experience
of
the
citizens
of
other
states.
we
are
indeed
a
populous
and
mobile
nation.
the
continuous
and
free
movements
of
people
within
and
among
states
throughout
the
entire
country
is
characteristic
of
our
national
life.
our
state,
one
of
the
original
13
has
the
eight
fastest
rate
of
growth
among
all
states,
and
annually,
we
experience
an
influx
of
persons
from
other
states.
the
prior
political
experience
and
the
capacity
for
political
activity
and
citizenship
of
persons
coming
in
to
our
state
is
of
vital
concern.
we
thus
have
a
keen
interest
and
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
and
a
decision
of
this
court
which
would
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965
with
its
promise
of
securing,
improving
and
expanding
the
exercise
of
the
political
rights
of
citizens
in
the
states
where
those
rights
have
not
been
recognized.
we
also
consider
it
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
secure
throughout
the
country
and
as
many
state
as
possible
a
broad
and
free
exercise
by
the
people
of
their
political
rights.
this
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
a
case
which
gave
us
clause
and
required
us
to
alter
our
previous
state
policy
stated
“no
right
is
more
precious
in
a
free
country
than
that
of
having
a
voice
in
the
election
of
those
who
make
the
laws
under
which
as
good
citizens
we
must
live.
other
rights
even
the
most
basic
or
illusory,
if
the
right
to
vote
is
undermined.
the
right
to
vote
and
the
exercise
thereof
thus
indeed
has
a
direct
impact
on
the
policies
and
actions
of
state
government
and
on
the
enactment
of
laws
by
which
the
people
are
to
be
governed.”
our
state
voting
laws
recognized
the
importance
of
suffrage
and
are
designed
to
accord
the
widest
range,
the
popular
exercise
of
the
political
franchise.
the
passing
interest
is
the
fact
that
the
first
negro
to
vote
in
the
united
states
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
thomas
mundy
peterson
who
cast
his
vote
in
perth
amboy,
new
jersey
on
march
31st,
1870,
the
day
after
the
passage
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
consequently,
we
do
not
view
with
alarm
or
misgivings
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
and
assuredly,
we
do
not
concede
congressional
action
in
this
area
as
an
encroachment
upon
any
power
which
we
would
otherwise
assert
or
reserve
to
ourselves.
the
power
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
prescribe
voter
qualifications
is
of
course
subject
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
to
congressional
enactments
designed
to
enforce
that
amendment.
in
short,
we
concede
that
the
policy
of
congress
which
is
reflected
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
as
a
reflection
of
our
own
state
policies.
now,
another
important
aspect
of
our
interest
in
this
case
involves
new
jersey's
participation
in
the
federal
system.
there
are
a
great
many
important
and
substantial
national
programs
which
encompass
federal
assistance
to
state
and
local
government.
examples
come
readily
to
mind;
the
economic
opportunity
act,
area
redevelopment,
urban
renewal
and
housing,
mass
transportation
and
highways,
aid
to
education.
these
programs
are
implemented
and
administered
on
the
state
and
local
level
by
local
government
within
the
framework
of
implementing
state
laws
and
to
state
elective
and
appointive
officials.
if
the
solitary
objectives
of
these
programs
are
to
be
realized
fully
it
is
we
think
imperative
that
they'd
be
administered
on
the
local
level
by
officials
truly
representative
of
the
people.
new
jersey's
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
is
not
therefore
academic.
for
example,
new
jersey
contributes
approximately
4%
of
the
total
funds
for
federal
programs
of
assistance
to
local
government.
it
receives
approximately
2%
of
total
distributions.
now,
there
may
indeed
be
a
need
for
greater
expenditures
of
federal
moneys
in
other
states
and
areas.
we
do
not
complain
here
of
disproportions
in
these
vital
federal
state
programs,
but
we
are
much
concerned
with
the
manner
in
which
the
moneys
of
our
citizens
is
spent
and
utilized
within
the
federal
system.
we
must
therefore
be
concerned
with
the
quality
of
government
in
the
states
who
are
our
partners
in
federalism.
in
sum
the
state
of
new
jersey
with
every
other
state
of
the
union
as
an
important
state
and
an
abiding
interest
in
this
historic
litigation.
now
this
court
has
had
the
benefit
of
ample
and
able
argument
on
the
part
of
the
counsel,
both
opponents
and
proponents,
with
respect
to
various
facets
of
the
voting
rights
act.
our
additional
comments
are
not
intended
to
be
repetitious
merely
emphatic
of
points
already
made
in
support
of
the
congressional
enactment.
two
elements
in
my
opinion
are
crucial
and
point
compellingly
to
the
conclusion
that
the
act
is
constitutional.
first,
there
has
been
a
failure
of
adequate
enforcement
with
respect
to
previous
voting
rights
legislation.
this
court
must,
as
in
congress,
note
this
history.
secondly,
there
is
ample
factual
documentation
to
justify
the
novel
and
the
decisive
remedies
embraced,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
now,
the
attorney
general
has
related
the
history
of
the
implementation
of
the
civil
rights
acts
of
1957,
1960
and
1964.
it
was
his
conclusion,
notwithstanding
the
compliment
paid
by
louisiana
yesterday
to
this
court
and
to
the
department
of
justice
with
respect
to
the
efficacy
of
judicial
enforcement,
that
despite
scrupulous,
unremitting
and
conscientious
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
national
government
to
secure
redress
on
behalf
of
aggrieved
citizens,
the
previous
civil
rights
acts
have
proved
inadequate.
as
stated
by
the
attorney
general
before
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary
litigation
on
a
case
by
case
basis
simply
cannot
do
the
job.
this
history
forcibly
underscores
not
so
much
why
congress
enacted
the
particular
solutions
envisaged
by
the
1965
act,
but
also
why
it
was
compelled
to
consider
new
approaches
the
problems
of
racial
discrimination
in
connection
with
the
right
to
vote.
there's
no
need
to
recount
the
complete
overwhelming
factual
documentation
demonstrating
the
need
for
the
solutions
encompassed
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
these
have
already
been
mentioned
in
our
argument.
we
capitulate
it
in
the
various
briefs
filed
and
recorded
in
the
extensive
volumes
covering
the
reports
and
hearings
of
congress
and
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights.
the
act
is
thus,
not
based
solely
upon
or
borne
solely
of
the
emotions
touched
off
by
the
selma-montgomery
march
in
alabama.
what
cannot
be
over
emphasized,
however,
are
the
following
factors.
the
fact
that
literacy
tests
and
other
tests
and
devices
as
defined
in
the
1965
act
have
been
misused
and
abused
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
against
otherwise
eligible
voters
on
account
of
their
being
negro.
the
fact
that
in
states
where
this
discriminatory
use
and
design
of
literacy
test
has
been
established,
there
exists
articulated
and
effectuated
policies
of
racial
discrimination
affecting
other
areas
of
life
and
endeavor
and
the
fact
that
where
there
is
a
coincidence
between
the
use
of
literacy
tests
and
low
popular
participation
in
elections,
these
factors
is
usually
correlated
and
thus
speak
of
a
purposeful
racial
discrimination.
now
before
considering
the
relevance
of
these
foregoing
factors
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
voting
rights
act,
it
is
well
to
fix
briefly
the
undoubted
power
of
congress
to
enact
such
legislation
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
act
itself
is
denominated
as
an
act
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
been
used
many
times
to
nullify
state
imposed
voter
qualifications.
the
lower
court
in
united
states
versus
louisiana
were
marked.
there
is
no
license
for
the
loose
statement
that
in
our
constitutional
system,
the
qualification
of
voters
is
exclusively
committed
to
the
states
and
congress
has
traditionally
been
accorded
great
latitude
in
the
selection
of
appropriate
means
with
respect
to
the
public
accommodations
act
of
1964,
which
was
the
designed
to
achieve
social
objectives,
but
was
predicated
upon
the
commerce
clause
ordinarily
thought
to
encompass
economic
problems,
this
court
stated
in
heart
of
atlanta
motel,
what
means
are
to
be
employed
is
within
the
sound
and
exclusive
discretion
of
the
congress.
it
is
subject
to
only
one
caveat
that
the
means
chosen
by
it
must
be
reasonably
adopted
to
the
end
permitted
by
the
constitution.
it
is
in
this
context
and
setting
of
one,
the
disappointing
history
of
previous
enforcement
programs
and
two,
the
empirical
evidence
of
the
discriminatory
purpose
and
effect
of
literacy
in
similar
tests
where
suffrage
qualification
in
states
where
there
is
a
low
percentage
of
popular
involvement
in
elections
that
the
suitability
in
a
constitutional
sense
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
must
be
gauged.
now,
various
features
of
this
act
have
been
discussed
both
from
the
bench
and
the
bar.
the
heart
of
the
act,
however,
is
its
most
controversial
provision,
section
4.
now,
this
has
been
characterized
as
establishing
a
rule
in
the
nature
of
a
rebuttable
presumption
and
i
think
that
this
characterization
for
purposes
of
argument
is
generally
accepted
and
we
think
that
this
device
is
entirely
appropriate
and
necessary.
now,
in
argument
yesterday,
south
carolina
made
the
point
that
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
by
virtue
of
section
2,
congress
enjoys
only
the
power
to
enforce
not
to
regulate
the
aspects
brought
for
under
section
1.
i
think
this
is
indeed
a
semantic
distinction.
it
was
urged
that
congress
can
only
in
effect
punish
for
past
acts,
but
cannot
regulate
with
respect
to
future
conduct.
frankly,
i
don't
see
why
not.
congress
may
do
anything
appropriate
to
assure
the
full
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote
without
discrimination
and
that
vote
will
not
be
abridged
by
any
actions.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
assume
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
assume
the
question
is
hypothetical
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
the
facts
that
congress
had
before
was
the
evidence
that
in
most
of
the
states
where
the
literacy
tests
were
used
and
where
there
was
a
low
percentage
of
popular
involvement,
there
were
also
well-established
concerted
long
standing
policies
of
discrimination
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
literacy
tests
as
well
as
discrimination
in
other
walks
of
life.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
it
should
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
all
of
the
evidence,
but
with
respect
to
the
vote
at
1964
and
the
reason
for
that
date
which
was
of
some
concern
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
act
was
designed
to
have
immediate
remedial
effect
as
well
as
prospective
remedial
effect.
now
we
heard
a
great
deal
yesterday
for
example
as
to
how
several
of
the
states
in
the
south
affected
by
this
legislation
have
already
corrected
the
evils
that
they
assert
the
act
is
designed
to
attack
and
obviously,
in
1964
date
was
utilized
in
order
to
furnish
the
federal
government
with
a
reasonably
current
situation.
if
the
date
utilized
for
example
was
1960
or
a
date
more
remote,
then
perhaps
there
would
be
some
real
credibility
to
the
proposition
that
the
states
had
corrected
the
situations
with
which
congress
was
previously
concerned,
but
the
1964
date
of
course
is
a
current
and
i
think
strongly
militates
against
the
argument
that
from
the
1964
to
date
that
there
has
been
such
a
correction
of
the
evils
that
the
act
should
not
be
applied.
now,
the
use
of
a
presumption
as
a
device
for
initiating
the
enforcement
of
the
law
is
not
unknown.
section
4
(b)
in
effect
operates
like
any
evidentiary,
rebuttable
presumption
by
shifting
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
proof
to
the
party
which
is
most
able
to
furnish
such
proof.
thus,
the
use
of
a
presumption
not
only
strikes
at
the
inordinate
difficulties
encountered
under
previous
acts,
improving
cases
of
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government,
but
it
also
overcomes
the
problems
of
delay
and
frustration
encountered
in
a
case
by
case
judicial
enforcement
approach.
now,
the
provisions
of
the
act
also
call
for
the
suspensions
of
literacy
tests
and
devices
for
some
period
of
time
and
this
we
also
conceive
to
be
appropriate.
for
one
thing,
in
the
states
affected,
such
tests
have
usually
been
designed
and
applied
for
the
intentional
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
also
in
these
states,
there
has
been
a
policy
of
overt
or
covert
obstruction
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
moreover,
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
in
recent
judgment,
it
would
be
extreme
optimism
or
naive
take
to
assume
that
in
states
where
there
has
been
long
enduring
policies
of
racial
discrimination
that
even
well-disposed
officials
could
assure
the
fair
administration
of
such
tests
on
the
local
level.
now,
something
has
been
said
about
the
act
being
a
bill
of
attainder.
a
bill
of
attainder
as
i
understand
it
is
a
legislative
act
inflicting
punishment
usually
for
past
acts
in
such
a
way
that
the
affected
person
is
unable
to
avoid
such
punishment.
it
might
be
noted
that
traditionally,
bills
of
attainder
have
generally
been
applied
with
respect
to
legislation,
dealing
with
the
acts
of
individuals
such
as
threatening
to
overthrow
the
government
or
membership
in
the
communist
party.
i
for
one
would
doubt
that
it
has
any
sensible
application
to
states
as
such
or
to
the
area
of
voting
rights
and
privileges.
more
to
the
point
section
4
and
section
5
do
not
constitute
punishment
for
past
acts.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
insofar
as
section
5
might
be
thought
of
as
a
--
in
the
view
of
the
southern
states
as
a
punitive
device,
i
would
say
that
it
still
would
not
run
a
power
of
the
bill
of
attainder
prohibition
of
the
constitution.
i
do
not
clearly
under
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
prohibited
under
the
other
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution,
which
explicitly
provides
for
the
manner
in
which
constitutional
amendments
maybe
adapted.
i
don't
think
that
a
bill
of
attainder
argument
or
an
ex
post
facto
law
argument
would
be
the
provision
under
which
that
legislation
could
be
claimed
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
are
you
referring
mr.
justice
black
to
a
constitutional
amendment
to
a
state
contribution
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
would
have
difficulty
finding
affirmative
authority
for
such
a
congressional
enactment
rather
than
the
need
to
find
a
prohibition
which
would
preclude
such
a
congressional
enactment.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
it
would
be
our
position
that
section
5
is
constitutional.
yes,
and
i
think
it
would
be
constitutional
in
terms
of
an
appropriate
remedy
and
an
appropriate
approach
available
to
congress
under
section
2
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
the
problem
i
assume
that's
alluded
to
is
the
absence
of
a
genuine
case
or
controversy
which
gives
rise
to
the
exercise
of
judicial
power.
but
section
5
i
think
would
have
to
be
construed
in
the
context
of
a
case
already
before
the
courts
by
virtue
of
actions
brought
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
virtue
of
the
state
being
within
the
purview
of
section
4
and
therefore
not
having
before
it
the
right
to
impose
and
utilize
present
tests
and
devices.
i
think
it's
analogous
to
the
power
exercised
by
--
or
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
louisiana
case
in
which,
in
connection
with
the
injunctive
relief
which
this
court
fashioned
or
which
the
lower
court
fashioned
and
this
court
approved,
it
was
determined
that
the
state
could
not
apply
a
new
test
until
the
evils
or
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
had
been
corrected.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
this
would
give
me
serious
reservations.
now,
when
louisiana
itself
claimed
that
she
was
being
punished
for
past
activities
under
the
1960
civil
rights
act,
judge
wisdom
for
the
lower
court
in
louisiana
versus
united
states
said,
“its
purpose
is
not
to
punish
louisiana
for
past
activities.
neither
is
it
merely
to
prevent
continued
enforcement
of
unconstitutional
provisions
of
louisiana
law.
the
prime
purpose
is
to
provide
a
remedy
for
a
federally
protective
right”
and
finally,
we
think
it's
unrealistic
to
view
the
five-year
suspension
period,
the
need
for
which
has
been
documented
as
legislative
adjudication.
it
is
based
upon
congressional
fact-finding
that
such
a
period
of
suspension
is
necessary
in
order
to
cope
with
the
problems
of
long
standing
voter
discrimination.
for
all
of
these
reasons
as
well
as
those
previously
urged
by
the
attorney
general,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
we
urge
the
court
to
find
that
this
act
is
constitutional.
