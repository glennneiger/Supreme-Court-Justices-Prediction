justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that
congress
could
abolish
the
literacy
test
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
if
was
shown
as
a
matter
of
experience
to
be
instrumentality
of
discrimination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
could
--
do
you
think
it
could
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
--
don't
they
have
a
state
court
--
state
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
one
involving
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
a
literacy
test.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
had
a
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
involving
the
application
of
[inaudible]
apart
from
the
federal
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
the
choice
of
the
november
date
in
effect
identify
the
states
in
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
indeed,
wasn't
it
suggested
yesterday
i
think
by
louisiana
that
there
was
a
choice
made
even
though
that
brought
in
alaska
to
be
sure
that
louisiana
was
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
actually
gone
into
state
on
the
basis
of
any
test
or
device
except
for
the
literacy
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
what
you've
done
so
far?
i
mean
actually
where
you've
moved
in
with
your
expression.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
is
that
item
(c)
--
two
in
subsection
(c)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
four
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
actual
has
four
categories,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
just
interested
whether
it's
on
the
basis
of
any
--
other
than
one
or
perhaps
two
that
you
felt
it's
necessary
to
move
in
to
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
present
--
do
you
--
you
have
examiners
in
mississippi?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
understand
it
mississippi
appealed
its
good
moral
character
perhaps.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
it
--
that
requirement
in
part
which
moved
you
to
move
in.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
a
requirement
of
good
moral
character.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
didn't
really
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
attorney
general,
i
thought
you
suggested
earlier
that
it's
also
picked
because
the
result
by
using
it,
it
could
be
anticipated
in
terms
of
the
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
would
apply.
there's
nothing
wrong
about
that
resource.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
those
were
the
states
you
are
really
concerned
with.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
have
been
increased
to
52%
or
55%
or
dropped
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me
mr.
attorney
general.
as
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
that
they've
expressly
named
louisiana,
south
carolina,
mississippi,
alabama,
etcetera
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem.
that's
--
does
that
sound
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there
can't
be
any
argument
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cox,
the
sense
to
which
you
have
some
questions
of
rationality
and
so
forth
particularly
as
the
choice
in
the
1964
presidential
election
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
the
november
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
has
to
be
our
concern
with
the
choice
by
congress
of
that
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
but
apart
from
that
as
i
understood
it
mr.
cox
--
at
least
adopt
the
attorney
general
suggested
that
--
and
the
function
of
the
choice
of
date
was
to
be
sure
that
the
states
where
the
evidence
can
really
before
the
congress
indicated
the
abuse
of
the
tests
would
indeed
be
caught
under
the
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
--
if
that
were
so,
what
do
we
have
to
be
concerned
with?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
i've
made
myself
quite
clear
mr.
cox.
i
wasn't
--
this
question
wasn't
directed
to
the
distinction
or
difference
if
there
was
any
between
registration
day
and
general
election.
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
congress
made
this
choice
of
a
date
largely
to
assure
that
those
states
where
there
was
the
abusive
effects
would
come
within
the
reach
of
the
statute
and
my
question
was
in
the
constitutional
context
that
we're
dealing
with
this
problem,
what
should
be
our
concern
with
the
congress'
choice
of
that
date.
do
we
have
to
--
do
we
have
to
be
satisfied
that
it
was
a
rational
inference
in
the
choice
of
that
date
to
the
particular
mischief
that
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
must
be,
that's
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
we
don't
have
to
be
concerned
with
that
then,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
that
work?
suppose
you
want
it
purged
[inaudible]
now
under
what
circumstances
that
maybe
the
attorney
general
go
back
to
see
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
but
what
about
on
passing
laws?
you've
purged
for
example
and
you
want
to
pass
--
you
want
to
pass
a
new
law
and
you
do.
you
have
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
and
get
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
suspension
of
the
[inaudible]
five
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
south
carolina
established
what's
necessary
to
have
the
suspension
lifted
then
the
suspension
of
the
operation
of
the
devices
and
so
forth,
go
to
the
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
in
effect
thereafter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
what
section
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
forgive
me
if
i'm
not
making
--
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
unfortunately
in
my
opinion
i
don't
find
that
surprisingly
[inaudible]
other
than
the
denial
for
declaratory
judgment.
it
was
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
