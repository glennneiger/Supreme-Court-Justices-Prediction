mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
connection
with
one
comment
that
was
made
a
moment
ago
with
respect
to
the
fixed
idea
of
the
date
of
november
1964
as
being
the
determining
date
upon
which
the
determination
of
whether
the
individual
states
should
come
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
that
date
remains
a
fixed
date
and
that
although
under
the
provisions
of
sections
5
one
of
the
other
sections
of
the
law,
a
state
may
by
it's
action
come
without
the
scope
of
the
law
if
it
convinced
that
the
district
court,
the
district
of
columbia
appropriately.
nevertheless,
that
determination
will
remain
national
for
only
a
period
of
five
years
and
at
the
end
of
that
time,
the
state
is
still
governed
by
the
date
of
november
1964,
so
theoretically
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no.
mr.
justice,
i
said
that
the
triggering
device
is
activated
by
the
date
of
november
4,
1964.
that
date
is
a
fixed
date.
the
only
date.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
exactly.
now,
if
they
should
purge
themselves
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
by
that
procedure
they
do
purge
themselves
they're
still
in
the
position
of
ten
years
from
now,
still
being
subject
to
the
date
of
november
1964
so
that
theoretically
a
100%
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
any
time
on
--
within
his
discretion.
it's
discretionary
â€“
they're
suspended
for
three
to
five
years
as
i
recall.
the
examiners
rest
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
sending
in
of
the
examiners.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
now
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
now,
if
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
do
as
long
as
i
have
come
within
the
scope
of
the
law.
now,
i'm
purging
myself
i
mean
that
i
come
in
and
prove
in
the
district
court
of
columbia,
or
the
district
of
columbia
that
south
carolina
has
been
free
of
discrimination
that
judicial
determination
exists
for
a
period
of
five
years
and
no
further
inquiry
can
be
made
for
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
determination
of
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
so
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
it
will
be
for
a
period
of
five
years.
at
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
at
the
end
of
that
period,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
could
again
invoke
the
provisions
of
the
law
predicated
on
the
vote
and
the
registration
in
november
1964.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
--
the
--
4
(a)
your
honor,
4
(a).
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no
such
declaratory
judgment
shall
issue
with
respect
to
the
plaintiff
for
a
period
of
five
years
at
the
entry
of
a
final
judgment.
so
that
i
say
that
theoretically,
100%
of
the
persons
in
south
carolina
in
1975
could
be
registered,
you
could
have
a
100%
participation
in
voting
and
still
not
be
precluded
or
being
invoked
again
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
the
attorney
general's
chief
position
as
i
understand,
it
seems
to
be
prior
to
this
that
literacy
test
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
right.
now,
then
as
i
read,
it
means
that
south
carolina
is
free
from
adjudication
or
from
the
determination
it
become
within
the
scope
of
the
act
for
a
period
of
five
years
after
that
determination
has
been
made
and
the
attorney
general
cannot
bring
an
action
to
counter
avail
that
decision.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
the
only
date
fixed
for
the
calculation
of
the
50%
bracketing
is
november
1964.
the
attorney
general's
argument
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
literacy
test
are
some
[inaudible]
of
danger.
danger
was
the
word
that
he
used
that
if
a
state
has
a
literacy
test,
there
is
danger
that
they
were
used
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
that
litigation
is
too
slow
and
too
cumbersome
and
therefore
some
more
drastic
needs
should
be
achieved
to
get
immediate
relief.
but
the
point
of
fact
is
that
the
very
statements
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
here
today
contradict
and
avoid
the
application
of
the
very
procedure
that
he
argues
because
rather
than
showing
any
danger
in
a
number
of
states
that
are
caught
within
the
blanket
indictment
that's
supported
by
this
act
rather
than
a
number
of
those
states
are
admitted
by
their
own
concessions
here
in
open
court,
shown
to
be
non-existent
for
example
in
north
--
in
south
carolina
and
in
virginia.
in
the
complaint
brought
by
south
carolina,
it's
alleged
for
example
in
paragraph
19
that
south
carolina
denies
that
the
use
of
test
or
devices
has
been
followed
for
the
purpose
or
with
the
effect
of
denying
the
right
to
vote.
the
answer
of
the
attorney
general
alleges
insufficient
knowledge
of
information
on
which
to
express
a
belief
as
to
that
allegation.
the
testimony
of
mr.
katzenbach
before
the
congress
with
respect
to
virginia
and
with
respect
to
south
carolina
both
indicated
that
they
had
a
clean
bill
of
health
insofar
as
discriminatory
action
by
those
two
states
was
concerned.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
south
carolina
with
a
literacy
requirement
has
a
bigger
percentage
of
registration
in
florida
and
arkansas
which
have
no
literacy
requirements
and
about
the
same
as
the
state
of
texas
which
had
no
literacy
requirement.
the
absence
of
any
discrimination
is
shown
moreover
by
the
testimony
before
the
congress
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
although
a
summary
simple
procedure
provided
from
a
denial
of
registration
to
the
extent
that
a
special
session
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
will
be
called
to
pass
upon
and
allege
improper
denial
of
registration,
not
one
single
appeal
from
a
denial
of
registration
has
ever
been
taken
in
south
carolina.
the
reasons
for
the
registrars
in
south
carolina
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
not
related
whatsoever
to
any
alleged
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
it's
literacy
test
as
shown
by
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general
before
the
congress,
the
statements
of
the
attorney
general
here
before
this
court
today.
the
reasons
for
the
registrars
being
in
south
carolina
are
not
related
to
any
discrimination
on
the
literacy
requirements
which
as
i
have
stated
is
not
existent
in
my
state.
but
the
reasons
are
that
the
registrars
was
sent
there
simply
because
the
books
of
registry,
were
alleged
to
be
open
on
insufficient
number
of
days
during
the
month
although
they
were
open
in
general
institution
in
accordance
with
the
commands
of
the
south
carolina
statute.
the
relationship
between
the
number
of
persons
who
actually
voted
in
the
state
election
and
particularly
in
my
state
and
any
alleged
discriminatory
action
insofar
as
a
literacy
test
is
concerned
can
be
attributed
to
one
thing.
the
low
vote
in
the
general
election
resulted
number
one
from
apathy,
the
failure
of
person
to
exercise
the
rights
of
citizenship.
as
mr.
robinson
stated
the
main
argument
related
to
a
number
of
factors
including
education,
economic
standing
including
even
religious
affiliations,
but
apathy
is
primarily
the
reason
that
there
is
a
low
vote
of
participation
and
in
fact
a
low
vote
--
voter
registration
record
in
south
carolina.
the
fact
is
that
south
carolina
is
as
mr.
justice
clark
indicated
one
question,
i
will
refer
to
this
subject
in
one
question,
a
one
party
state
up
until
the
comparatively
recent
years.
within
the
last
ten
years,
the
democratic
party
controlled
the
entire
voting
process
so
that
participation
in
general
elections
was
negligible.
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
exhibit
one
on
page
21,
an
exhibit
showing
the
correlation
between
the
primary
voting
and
the
general
election
voting.
i
just
briefly
reciting
some
of
the
principle
ones
over
the
years
since
1924
where
51,000
persons
voted
in
the
general
election
of
that
year
whereas
199,000
persons
voted
in
the
primaries.
1942,
23,000
persons
voted
in
the
general
election,
234,000
persons
voted
in
the
primary
elections.
and
in
1960
where
the
question
was
pointed
to
a
moment
ago,
the
general
election
vote
exceeded
the
primary
election
vote,
387,000
to
304,000.
the
reason
for
that
is
very
simple
because
there
was
only
one
contested
statewide
primary
reason
and
it
was
during
presidential
election
year
when
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
interest
expressed
in
that
contrary
to
president
over
the
past
preceding
generation.
in
1962,
313,000
in
the
general
election,
328,000
in
the
primary
election.
now
the
reason
for
the
absence
of
any
figures
with
respect
to
the
primary
election
of
1964
is
because
there
was
no
contested
statewide
election
during
that
year.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
there
was
a
primary
but
locally
and
we
do
not
have
the
figures
collected
from
each
of
the
46
counties.
it
was
difficult
if
not
impossible
we
had
attempted
to
get
those
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
would
judge
so
because
the
interest
in
the
local
election
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
race
again
more
than
race
where
in
some
instances
you'll
have
running
for
an
office
of
that
nature
paying
$50
a
month,
15
or
19
persons
running
for
a
job
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
1964,
i
do
not
recall
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
do
not
recall
within
the
congressional
races
in
it
or
not.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
primary
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
what's
that
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
sheriffs?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i'm
sorry
i
did
not
understand
you.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
four
years.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
oh
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
don't
think
so
on
a
number.
i
do
not
recall
offhand.
i
do
not
recall
the
1964
sheriff's
election
but
based
upon
my
own
observation,
i'm
sure
that
the
races
locally
[inaudible]
would
generate
a
considerable
interest
that
wouldn't
be
in
all
likelihood
the
total
primary
votes
for
1964
in
all
likelihood
did
exceed
the
524,000
somewhat
who
cast
votes
in
the
presidential
election
year.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
the
--
it
was
in
any
event
mr.
justice
clark
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
--
if
i
may,
i
shall
proceed
rather
briefly
through
these
remaining
points.
the
arbitrary
nature
of
this
imposition
is
shown
by
consideration
of
one
fact
and
that
is
that
whereas
the
states
of
california,
massachusetts,
new
york,
come
before
this
court
and
urge
this
court
to
say
that
illiterates
in
south
carolina
should
be
permitted
to
vote.
in
massachusetts,
my
colleague
expressed
a
very
tenuous
solicitude
for
the
negro
vote
there
but
the
negro
who
is
illiterate
in
massachusetts
cannot
vote
whereas
it
is
urged
upon
this
court
to
say
that
the
negro
who
is
illiterate
in
south
carolina
should
be
permitted
to
vote.
california
has
the
same
situation
so
that
if
an
illiterate,
in
my
state,
move
to
california,
he
cannot
vote.
new
york
has
a
tenuous
solicitude
also
and
they
urge
upon
this
court
that
the
illiterate
be
required
to
--
allowed
to
vote
without
taking
a
literacy
test,
but
in
new
york
they're
asking
in
what
state
was
jean
adams
born?
and
he'll
have
to
know
the
answer
to
that
before
he
can
be
admitted
to
the
election
rows.
they're
asking
what
is
the
name
of
the
captain
who
first
raised
all
glory
in
the
navy?
how
would
you
--
will
the
united
states
flag
be
in
1977?
in
what
month
did
the
group
of
men
meet
to
rewrite
the
articles
of
confederation?
who
was
chosen
president
of
the
convention?
what
kind
of
suit
did
he
wear?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
those
are
the
literacy
test
that
are
imposed,
devised
by
the
board
of
regents
in
the
state
of
new
york.
that
is
the
literacy
test
for
prior
years.
the
current
one
is
kept
intact
for
security
reasons.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well,
it's
possible
that
a
test
of
that
nature
might
have
witted
a
few
well-educated
persons
in
my
state,
but
it
is
required
here.
another
fact
--
at
least
if
i
may
emphasize
is
the
names
that
are
placed
upon
the
books
by
the
federal
registrars
remained
on
those
books.
there's
no
provision
for
subsequently
discovered
violation
and
the
time
to
voted
is
ten
days
is
not
sufficient
for
us
to
discover
whether
or
not
they
have
in
fact
been
convicted
over
disqualifying
ground
although
in
fairness
the
attorney
general
has
worked
informally
not
compelled
to
do
it.
but
he
has
worked
informally
to
removing
some
but
nevertheless
if
a
person
should
commit
a
crime
in
the
future
there's
no
assurance
and
no
procedure
whereby
that
person's
name
can
be
removed
from
the
roll.
finally,
there's
one
important
factor
that
occurs
and
that
is
with
respect
to
the
challenges
that
maybe
filed.
we
have
filed
the
challenges
of
a
number
of
instances
although
the
registrars
if
not
registered
but
what
i
am
talking
about
in
600
persons.
some
of
those
challenges
are
pending.
now,
we
would
have
an
opportunity
to
go
before
the
federal
registrar.
we
would
go
before
the
civil
service
commission
and
then
into
the
courts.
and
in
the
determination
of
that,
the
question
of
whether
this
person
is
in
fact
a
resident
of
south
carolina
must
be
determined.
it
will
be
determined
by
the
civil
service
commission
initially.
it
will
be
determined
ultimately
by
the
federal
courts.
now,
if
they
have
an
election
tomorrow
and
not
just
the
county
where
the
registrars
are,
if
they
have
an
election
tomorrow
and
one
of
those
persons
or
several
of
them
cast
their
ballot
and
they
are
challenged
by
candidate
possibly
at
the
risk
of
criminal
prosecution
by
the
united
states
but
if
they
are
challenged
and
if
a
sufficient
number
of
those
votes
are
challenged
to
i
think
the
result
of
the
election,
the
determination
of
who
won
that
election
in
that
event
will
rest
not
in
the
courts
of
south
carolina
but
in
the
federal
administrative
procedures
and
in
the
federal
courts.
so
that
the
same
situation
in
a
close
election
which
is
not
uncommon
such
as
arose
in
wisconsin
i
believe
where
50
votes
out
of
a
million
cast
separated
and
determined
who
was
going
to
be
the
governor
of
that
state.
now,
if
sufficient
number
of
those
votes
are
involved
in
procedures
such
as
the
attorney
general
institutes
and
the
determination
of
who
is
going
to
be
the
governor
of
wisconsin
or
who
is
going
to
be
the
sheriff
of
dochester
county
or
who
would
--
whether
the
advantage
that
maybe
voted
on
in
the
past
will
be
determined
not
by
the
courts
of
south
carolina
but
by
the
federal
judiciary
and
that
is
not
appropriate
under
the
constitution
of
the
state.
