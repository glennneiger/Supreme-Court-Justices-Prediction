mr.
joe
t.
patterson
thank
you
sir.
i
would
like
only
to
take
ten
minutes
of
the
allotted
time
to
the
state
of
mississippi,
leaving
the
balance
for
the
honorable
judge
clark
to
this
special
assistance
associated
with
me
in
this
argument.
i
shall
address
myself
solely
to
the
triggering
clause
and
the
nullifying
state
laws
by
suspension
--
by
suspending
a
“valid”
constitutional
state
law.
i
submit
that
the
50%
figure
as
of
november
1,
1964,
on
the
50%
participation
in
presidential
elections
of
1964,
is
an
arbitrary
and
mythical
formula
admitted
to
be
solely
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
these
particular
states
intended
that
the
act
shall
be
applied
to.
and
further,
just
as
deliberately
designed
and
intended
to
exclude
all
other
states
and
never
to
apply
to
any
other
state
although
other
states
may
at
some
time
in
the
future
fall
within
this
very
50%
formula.
therefore,
the
19
or
20
states
including
massachusetts
and
new
jersey,
who
appear
and
argue
orally
as
amicus
in
support
of
the
u.s.
attorney
general
can
do
so
that
it
contend
and
secure
in
the
thought
that
the
arbitrary,
unprecedented
and
in
our
opinion
unconstitutional
provisions
of
this
act
cannot
and
never
will
apply
to
them.
at
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
further
provided
in
addition
to
the
50%
formula
as
of
november
1,
1964
that
it
should
also
apply
to
any
state
that
had
a
literacy
requirement
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
then
i
am
confident
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
would
be
here
as
amicus
in
support
of
south
carolina.
because
at
the
time
the
adoption
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
massachusetts
had
a
strict
literacy
requirement
and
her
senators
and
congressmen
defeated
proposals
to
include
literacy
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
this
act
provided.
that
it
should
apply
to
states
having
property
requirements
to
vote
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
then
rhode
island
and
new
york
would
be
here
as
amicus
in
support
of
south
carolina
because
they
insisted
on
retention
of
that
right.
that
this
act
provided
that
it
should
apply
to
states
that
had
voting
laws
designed
and
intended
to
discriminate
against
certain
people,
on
account
of
national
origin
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
west
coast
states,
particularly
california,
would
be
here
as
amicus
in
support
of
south
carolina
because
the
record
shows
that
the
senators
from
the
west
coast
states
used
harsh
language
in
no
uncertain
terms
in
expressing
their
desire
and
the
intention
to
exclude
the
chinese
from
the
ballot
at
that
time.
if
the
congress
can
pave
this
act
to
laws
and
conditions
existent
in
the
state
as
of
november
1,
1964,
regardless
of
whether
such
laws
and
conditions
have
changed
into
that
day,
then
by
the
same
authority
as
well
as
logic,
it
could
go
back
to
1869.
my
counterparts
who
would
be
here
as
amicus
in
support
of
the
u.s.
attorney
general,
will
i'm
sure
say,
we
have
changed
or
repeal
those
laws
that
discriminated
on
account
of
property
or
literacy
requirements,
on
account
of
national
origin.
and
i
stand
here,
and
say
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
since
november
1,
1964
by
amendment
to
its
constitution
and
by
acts
of
the
legislature,
repealed
and
changed
its
laws
governing
registration
to
vote,
reducing
such
requirements
to
a
minimum,
incapable
of
discriminatory
administration.
in
attempting
to
apply
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
to
the
state
of
mississippi,
the
government
seeks
to
punish
a
state
because
laws
were
in
existence
in
mississippi
on
november
1,
1964
alleged
to
be
discriminatory
and
because
50%
were
not
registered
or
did
not
vote
in
november
1964.
irrespective
of
the
admitted
fact
that
such
laws
have
now
been
repealed
and
registration
requirements
reduce
to
a
bare
minimum
that
in
no
way
violate
the
prohibitions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
which
this
very
act
is
bottom
old
and
states
in
its
very
title
that
it's
an
act
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
pronouncements
of
this
court,
beginning
with
minor
v.
happersett
in
1875
to
lassiter
versus
northampton
in
1959
and
carrington
versus
rash
in
1965,
are
all
applicable
here.
and
that
congress
cannot
authorize
and
direct
suspension
of
state
laws
that
in
no
way
violate
rights
secured
by
the
fifteenth
amendment,
simply
because
that
state
had
in
the
past
laws
alleged
to
be
violative
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
in
conclusion,
although
my
friend,
the
u.s.
attorney
general,
in
hearings
in
this
act
so
fit
to
say
that
regardless
of
how
the
state
of
mississippi
may
change
its
laws
reducing
qualification
to
register
and
vote,
he
would
not
conceive
good
faith
and
good
intentions
to
the
state
of
mississippi
in
its
desire
to
make
registration
and
voting
easier
for
members
of
the
color
and
race.
i
stand
upon
the
record
as
reflected
by
the
records
of
the
82
county
registrars
in
mississippi
which
shows
that
since
applying
to
reduce
for
requirements
to
register
in
accordance
with
the
present
law
of
mississippi
beginning
august
1,
1965
to
october
1965,
66,886
people
have
been
registered.
and
i
am
confident
that
85%
or
90%
of
that
number
are
members
of
the
colored
race.
and
during
that
same
time,
federal
registrars
and
they
have
come
to
our
states
in
number
but
they
have
only
registered
during
that
same
period
of
time
13,120
to
vote.
therefore,
as
we're
doing
better
than
even
--
my
friend
is
with
this
arbitrary
file.
our
only
difference
with
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
the
state
of
mississippi
has
the
right
to
require
that
a
person
be
able
to
read
and
write
in
order
to
register.
and
with
that
eliminated,
we
are
in
perfect
accord.
in
spite
of
expressions
of
doubt
of
good
faith
by
the
u.s.
attorney
general,
i
prefer
to
take
that
this
court
is
going
to
follow
the
expressions
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
recent
case
of
cameron
versus
johnson
which
came
from
mississippi.
when
mr.
black's
--
justice
black
said,
“it
is
true
that
we
have
only
recently
held
that
mississippi
must
not
deny
a
constitutional
right
of
negroes
to
register
and
vote,
but
this
of
course
does
not
mean
that
no
good
or
valid
law
could
come
out
of
the
state
of
mississippi.”
we
submit
that
a
good
and
valid
law
has
come
out
of
the
state
of
mississippi
that
it
should
not
be
arbitrarily
suspended
that
we
should
be
permitted
to
register
voters.
this
court
has
judiciously
and
as
jealously
and
forcefully
protected
the
right
of
the
individual
against
discrimination
as
it
should
have
done.
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
same
court
should
protect
the
constitutional
right
of
a
state
against
discrimination
and
that
it
should
be
equally
and
jealously
and
just
as
forcefully
protect
it.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
kind
attention.
