justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carter
was
there
any
question
of
service
on
the
jurisdiction
over
this
petitioner?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
question
in
this
case
of
whether
or
not
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
this
petitioner
that
is
whether
or
not
the
service
upon
them
was
a
profit.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
should
think
that
they
included
in
the
question
to
which
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
limited.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
if
that
is
--
that
question
or
whether
or
not
there
was
any
issue
made
or
whether
or
not
they
were
properly
in
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
probably
understand
what
you
just
said
mr.
carter.
do
you
mean
that
you
don't
think
you're
--
you're
required
to
do
that
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law
or
do
you
mean
that
if
the
georgia
law
does
require
you
to
do
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
seems
to
say
that
the
georgia
law
is
required.
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
part
of
the
constitution
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
aren't
you
--
if
these
people
are
your
agents
i
can
understand
that
position,
but
if
they're
not
your
agents
what's
the
--
which
is
your
claim
here
now
and
has
to
be
on
the
issue
presented
here
to
us
and
if
they're
not
your
agents
what's
wrong
with
requiring
that
you
say
so?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
mr.
carter
insofar
as
this
case
involves
simply
the
law
of
agency
in
the
state
of
georgia
or
insofar
as
it
involves
simply
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
factual
determination
of
the
agency
and
therefore
to
support
the
georgia
law
of
respondeat
superior,
all
those
issues
are
no
proper
business
for
this
court,
aren't
they?
i
think
you
recognize
that
because
you
put
this
--
you
put
the
question
before
this
court
in
terms
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
to
that
extent
isn't
the
suggestion
of
my
brother
brennan
correct,
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
complete
absence
of
any
evidence.
i
mean
you
have
to
show
that
you
think
that
it's
just
as
arbitrary
to
take
your
money
and
to
satisfy
this
judgment
as
it
would
be
to
take,
let's
say
the
money
of
the
--
of
the
chrysler
motor
car
corporation
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
you
have
absolutely
no
connection
with
these
--
with
the
people
who
are
responsible
for
this
tort,
the
state
tort.
justice
potter
stewart
so
we're
not
really
concerned
here,
can't
we
with
the
state
law
of
agency
or
the
state
that
are
--
or
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
because
those
are
matters
of
--
for
the
state
courts
which
we
have
no
business.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
