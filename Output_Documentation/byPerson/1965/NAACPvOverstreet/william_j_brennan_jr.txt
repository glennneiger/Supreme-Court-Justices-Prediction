justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
carter
what
--
is
the
basis
of
liability
of
the
new
york
corporation
respondeat
superior?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
ask
a
question
sir.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
i'm
too
familiar
with
the
n.a.a.c.p.
structure,
is
that
branch
--
what
is
a,
what
is
a
branch?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
non
profitable,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
carter,
the
corporation
has
branch
offices
ordinarily
and
ordinarily
industrial
corporation
commercially
and
i
gather
what
you're
saying
though
is
this
that
the
savannah
branch
is
not
anything
comparable
to
the
branch
office
of
an
ordinary
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
--
now
suppose
--
suppose
we
had
a
situation
where
the
act
--
which
was
actually
a
branch
office
of
a
corporation
and
the
manager
of
that
branch
office
had
done
the
things
that
were
found
here,
you
would
have
no
trouble
i
suppose
or
would
you
in
saying
that
a
judgment
which
reached
the
parent
--
the
corporation
itself
would
be
consistent
with
our
ordinary
principles
of
respondeat
superior,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
concerns
me
is
on
this
record
as
you
said
yourself
you've
been
telling
us
things
that
do
not
appear
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
is
not
that
kind
of
situation
would
not
--
that
have
been
a
burden
of
the
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
how
--
how
is
the
plaintiff
to
know
these
facts
and
this
unique
relationship
between
the
savannah
branch
and
the
new
york
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
part
--
for
example
let
me
think
--
i
think
in
fact
my
other
illustrations,
as
far
as
the
general
motors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
general
motors,
they
have
a
branch
office
in
atlanta,
georgia
and
something
--
the
management
does
something,
and
a
lawsuit
is
brought
against
general
motors
corporation.
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
branch
--
the
branch
of
general
motors
and
he
was
the
manager
of
that
branch,
does
the
plaintiff
have
to
go
on
and
establish
it
ordinarily,
would
he
that
indeed
that's
what
this
fellow
was.
he'd
have
to
prove
that
he
was
the
manager
of
the
branch
office
that
this
was
the
branch
set
up
by
general
motors
in
atlanta
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
they
got
the
man
place
another,
is
that
a
branch
law
or
is
the
law
--
now,
he
testified
to
a
number
of
things
indicating
and
pretty
much
what
you
have
told
us
you
know,
was
the
relationship
between
the
branch
and
the
parent
corporation.
as
i
remember
the
such
things
any
part
of
the
funds
they've
collected
and
they
go
back.
he
said
that
policy
is
made
of
the
national
conventions
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
we
have
to
adhere
to
the
policy.
now
why
is
it
that
you
suggest
that
that
under
the
georgia
rule
accepting
what
you
have
said
to
be
the
georgia
rule
namely
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proving
this
agency,
why
do
you
suggest
that
the
georgia
courts
could
not
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law
accept
this
as
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
agencies.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
carter,
may
i
ask
you,
test
is
to
that
--
it
isn't
--
the
test
is
of
agency
would
not
deal
with
it
whether
the
new
york
corporation
knew
of
these
particular
events.
the
test
of
agency
is
whether
the
actor,
here,
mr.
law
was
in
fact
agent
and
that
doesn't
require
knowledge
of
you
folks
in
new
york,
does
it
of
what
he
was
doing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
really
a
question
now
assuming
agency,
you'd
say
there's
no
proof
that
what
he
did
was
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
as
agent,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
you're
--
now
i
gather
that
your
position
is
that
the
plaintiff's
burden
is
both,
one,
to
prove
agency
and
also
that
the
particular
acts
within
the
scope
his
authority
or
if
not
were
ratified
by
the
new
york
corporation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
this
had
been
the
manager
of
your
atlanta
branch
who
would
led
this
--
this
operation
and
you
knew
nothing
about
it
in
new
york.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
to
the
extent
you
mean
of
acting
for
you,
again,
that
he
had
led
this
picket
line
and
assuming
it
was
violence
on
the
picket
line.
you'd
have
no
questions
then
on
reliability
of
the
new
york
corporation
or
those
acts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
atlanta.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
--
on
the
acts.
if
it's
--
we're
going
to
see
that
there's
any
such
burden
on
you
affirmatively
to
establish
that
in
the
case
of
this
kind
of
branch.
