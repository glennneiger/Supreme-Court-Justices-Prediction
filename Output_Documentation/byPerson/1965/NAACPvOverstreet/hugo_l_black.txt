justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
carter
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
organization
set
up
something
right
to
the
terminal
of
this
where
they
have
take
for
instance
that
was
a
suit
against
the
law
[inaudible]
and
the
claim
was
made
that
the
head
organization
was
not
liable
for
what
happened
in
their
local
organization.
are
you
setting
up
the
claim
that
you're
not
liable?
and
what
is
the
difference
between
your
membership
so
far
as
your
home
office
is
concerned,
your
local
membership
and
the
--
that
of
[inaudible]
paternal
organization?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'll
tell
you
why
i'm
asking.
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
the
case.
but
many
years
ago
there's
a
case
against
the
loyal
order
of
moose
that
they
set
up
that
they
were
--
the
head
office
was
not
liable
for
a
death
that
was
caused
by
an
initiation.
the
judgment
was
rendered
and
that
went
all
the
way
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
and
then
came
to
this
court
later
on.
and
this
court
held
that
the
other
state
was
bound
to
recognize
the
judgment
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
i
do
not
recall
how
much
it
has
to
do
with
this
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
in
the
realm
of
the
area,
general
area,
which
you're
arguing
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
sum
total
of
your
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
burden
is
on
â€“
should
have
been
put
on
the
plaintiff
by
the
state.
the
state
is
the
one
who
has
put
on
the
burden
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
not
--
that's
not
the
--
is
that
the
law
of
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
sustained
this
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
basis
here
is
that
the
burden
--
your
basis
that
the
burden
constitutionally
according
to
the
federal
constitution
has
to
be
put
on
the
plaintiff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
there's
no
evidence
or
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
still
remains
--
suppose
the
states
says
we
don't
require
anymore
evidence
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
number
of
--
it
is
--
that
the
group
associated
with
the
national
organization
and
if
they
want
to
put
it
up
that's
the
defense
[inaudible].
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
is
unconstitutional,
is
that
is?
