mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
in
order
to
get
the
issues
in
this
case
clear
i
would,
if
the
court
will,
i
like
to
give
the
background
facts
in
this
case
first.
this
case
arose
when
the
respondent
who
is
the
owner
of
a
tropical
market
grocery
and
meat
store
in
the
negro
neighborhood
in
savannah,
georgia.
an
employee
of
his,
which
was
about
a
15-year-old
negro
boy,
indicated
to
his
mother
that
he
had
been
hit
by
the
proprietor
of
this
store.
a
warrant
was
taken
out
for
the
respondent
and
he
was
interrogated
and
investigated
by
officers.
the
mother
indicated
that
after
she
had
made
the
complaint
to
the
police
that
she
received
some
threatening
telephone
calls
as
a
the
result
that
she
got
in
touch
with
the
local
n.a.a.c.p.
which
was
in
savannah.
they
had
a
meeting
and
had
a
circular
out
in
which
they
indicated
people
to
come
to
hear
about
this
brutality
by
this
man
as
a
result
of
the
meeting
in
which
one
of
the
defendants
below,
mr.
law
was
the
president
of
the
local
branch
and
a
reverend
jordan
who
was
the
vice
president,
attended.
the
branch
decided
that
they
would
have
picket
around
the
store
of
the
respondent.
the
testimony
on
the
part
of
law
is
that
they
put
two
on
each
corner
around
this
--
around
it.
they
were
instructed
to
be
peaceful
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
as
a
result
of
this
picketing
which
began
on
june
1
and
lasted
until
an
injunction
was
issued
on
june
22,
this
was
suit
for
damage
was
brought
against
the
local
n.a.a.c.p.
against
the
state
n.a.a.c.p.
against
the
two
individuals
and
against
a
new
york
corporation.
the
--
a
word
of
damages
by
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
was
a
$35
judgment
--
$35,000
judgment.
the
ordinary
damages
against
the
--
all
of
the
defendants
and
a
$50,000
judgment
of
punitive
damages
are
against
all
of
the
defendants.
an
appeal
was
taken
through
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
it
was
affirmed
as
to
all
but
the
georgia
state
conference.
we
brought
the
case
here
alleging
the
--
there
was
a
violation
of
various
rights
of
peaceful
picketing
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
regrettably
limited
certiorari
to
the
validity
of
the
judgment
as
against
the
new
york
corporation.
that
is
the
issue
which
is
before
the
court
at
the
present
time.
that
is
whether
the
judgment
of
$85,000
which
the
new
york
corporation
is
liable
is
valid
and
is
attainable.
we
think
that
the
question
on
that
if
the
court
pleases
is
not
closed.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
that
the
question
is
not
a
closed
one.
we
think
that
the
--
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
in
any
respect
that
the
new
york
corporation
was
present
or
was
anyway
responsible
or
condoned
or
affirmed
or
benefit
or
any
of
the
rational
upon
which
it's
responsibility
could
be
established
for
these
acts
that
this
has
not
been
shown
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
no.
we
don't
think
--
quite
frankly
we
don't
think
that
question
is
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
problem
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
filed
a
demurrer
alleging
that
--
that
there
was
no
the
jurisdiction
so
far
as
the
petitioner
as
the
new
york
corporation
was
concerned
in
terms
of
service
and
so
forth.
the
demurrer
--
demurrers
were
overruled
at
that
time
and
we
therefore
--
we
then
filed
an
answer
and
went
on
to
trial
raising
the
various
issues
as
for
the
general
jurisdiction
of
contesting
the
power
of
the
--
contesting
the
issue
on
the
merits
so
that
although
we
did
not
give
up
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
we
didn't
--
at
that
time
we
did
a
question
to
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
the
court
did
not
review
that.
the
court
limited
liability
to
the
new
york
corporation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
that
this
is
the
only
--
i
think
that
this
is
the
theory
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
i
mean
the
respondent
here
but
the
plaintiff
below.
the
theory
of
the
case
in
which
they
attempted
to
prove
on
judgment
that
mr.
law
by
having
the
--
who
was
the
president
of
the
local
branch,
and
of
the
georgia
state
group.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
new
york
--
there's
a
--
a
new
york
corporation
which
is
a
membership
corporation
organizing
the
laws
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
we
charter
local
unions
and
they
are
various
kinds
and
various
names
but
a
local
union
in
the
particular
city
is
an
unincorporated
association.
it
is
called
a
branch
that
is
made
up
of
adult
people
who
come
together
and
it
has
been
50
or
more
persons
and
they
come
together
in
the
local
union
and
they
are
carrying
on
activities
locally
in
the
name
of
the
association.
that's
unincorporated
association.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
as
far
as
we
know
i
--
our
view
is
that
georgia
law
would
be
applicable
but
that
under
any
circumstances
that
the
georgia
as
we
read
georgia
cases
that
georgia
has
not
applied
its
own
law
to
this
instance,
that
it
is
departed
from
its
own
law
but
--
law
in
regard
to
this.
but
our
view
is
that
the
--
that
under
any
standard
that
this
is
the
denial
of
constitutional
due
process
because
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
showing,
there's
no
evidentiary
showing
that
the
new
york
corporation
was
in
any
way
present
–
present
under
any
--
under
any
analysis
or
under
any
standard
of
law
even
georgia
or
otherwise.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
new
york
corporation,
it's
a
union,
it's
an
affiliate
of
the
new
york
corporation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
form
of
the
affiliation
is
a
charter
--
rendered
the
charter
by
dues
or
a
member
who
pays
dues
into
the
local
organization
and
by
virtue
of
that
becoming
member
of
the
national
--
of
the
national
corporation.
there
is
a
--
they
have
their
own
offices
pursuant
to
constitutional
bylaws
at
their
own
offices
that
they
have
their
own
offices.
they
have
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
they're
elected
by
the
--
in
the
local
--
by
the
people
locally
we
have
no
–
appoint
in
regard
to
this
and
they
have
jurisdiction
to
operate
and
function
within
the
territorial
limits
with
which
they
charter
--
carries
on
it.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
have
the
--
i
--
let
me
point
out
quite
clearly
that
all
of
these
questions
that
are
raised
in
regard
to
our
relationship
none
of
it
is
in
the
record
at
all
and
not
--
nothing
on
this
question
was
--
was
presented
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
record
in
this
case.
the
answer
to
your
question,
the
new
york
corporation
has
--
general
power
for
example
we
do
make
the
general
national
policy
which
is
binding
on
all
of
our
constituent
unions.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right,
that's
precisely
right.
this
is
a
question
of
basic
policy.
we
--
in
this
particular
instance,
the
general
purposes
of
our
local
unions
with
the
n.a.a.c.p.
is
to
advance
the
group
interest
of
negroes
and
to
prove
the
status
of
the
negroes
so
this
--
so
basically
this
is
solved.
we
find
that
a
union
is
not
operating
like
that
--
to
that
extent
or
is
going
contrary
to
some
national
policy
that
we
feel
is
--
advances
that
interest.
for
example
a
unit
would
indicate
that
their
favorite
segregation
for
example,
our
view
would
be
on
that
this
would
be
contrary
to
advancing
group
interest
and
we
would
feel
that
this
would
be
something
that
would
be
--
that
we
would
be
able
to
take
measures,
but
in
the
normal
these
units
are
semi
autonomous
units.
they
function
not
with
locally
in
regard
to
matters
of
concern
to
them
at
the
local
level
and
we
do
not
really
come
in
contact
with
them
with
regard
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
they
have
funds
of
their
own.
they
have
a
basic
membership
for
it
that
they
raised
and
that
that
is
divided
between
us
and
then
they
may
of
course
locally
raise
money
or
have
fairs
in
raising
money.
they
have
their
own
treasure
--
treasury
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
i'm
–
on
that
mr.
justice
harlan
i
can't
tell
and
i
might
as
well
be
very
frank
to
the
court.
i
think
we
put
--
place
that
--
put
that
in
our
brief.
the
probability
is
and
insofar
as
the
response
to
the
judgment
is
concerned
in
this
case
that
the
new
york
corporation,
the
savannah
branch
and
the
other
people
are
held
responsible,
the
new
york
corporation
will
be
required
to
pay
for
it,
pay
for
it
at
the
practical
matter
and
an
organizational
matter.
but
this
of
course,
there
is
a
difference
between
whether
we
have
to
do
it
as
a
practical
matter
whether
we
have
a
legal
responsibility.
we
don't
feel
there
is
any
legal
responsibility
for
us
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
but
since
the
judgment
below
would
in
effect
mean
and
that
there
would
be
no
savannah
branch
and
the
individual
defendants
would
be
liable.
i
think
that
the
national
corporation
would
have
to
take
some
responsibility
in
terms
of
sudden
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir,
it
has
not
been
satisfied.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
precisely.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
wouldn't
have
--
i
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
controlling
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
the
plaintiff
should
made
an
allegation
and
is
charging
an
agency
and
the
respondeat
superior,
it
seems
to
me
that
he's
under
an
obligation
to
prove
it.
one
of
the
matters
which
he
could
put
--
he
could
have
prove
it
or
could
have
demonstrated
it
or
could
have
attempted
to
have
shown
was
by
virtue
of
having
something
that
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
local
corporation
and
its
connection
with
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
general
motors?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
that
what
he
would
have
to
establish
that
he's
going
to
establish
the
question
of
the
agency
he
would
have
to
establish
that,
and
you
have
to.
the
court
--
the
record
is
going
to
have
to
show
that
there
is
some
nexus
between
that
branch
and
whatever
you
call
it
and
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
insofar
as
responsibility
for
these
actions
and
that
in
fact
--
we
have
a
branch
in
the
sense
that
you
now
use
the
term
in
georgia,
but
that
branch
is
in
atlanta.
it
has
an
office
that
we
--
that
the
national
corporation
maintains
and
we
have
employees
that
we
pay
and
that
office
is
in
atlanta,
georgia
where
we
have
people
who
are
on
the
payroll
of
the
national
office.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
qualify
--
no
sir.
we
qualify
to
do
business
interstate
and
as
you
know
that
question
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
what
we
require
to
qualify
is
to
rest
to
file
our
certificate
of
--
the
corporation
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
point
your
honor
is
that
in
our
judgment
we
need
to
have
--
have
always
felt
that
we
did
not
–
that
we
were
not
present
for
these
purposes
but
it
was
easier
for
us
to
comply
with
the
law
than
to
be
involved
in
a
series
of
litigation,
like
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama
and
so
forth.
so
that
what
we
did
was
that
we
complied
in
most
of
these
states
by
filing
articles
of
incorporation
and
designated
an
agent
of
sorts
although
i
think
that
sometimes
ago
we've
indicated
that
we
did
not
believe
that
we
were
required
to
do
so.
now
we
do
believe
that
we're
required
to
do
so
in
the
place
where
we
maintain
an
office,
a
branch
office
in
the
sense
that
mr.
justice
brennan
indicated,
but
not
where
all
we
have
on
local
affiliate
communities
whether
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
i
said
it
was
easier
for
us
because
we
believe
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh
yes.
we
--
the
money
on
membership
dues
50%
--
half
of
the
basic
membership
dues
is
sent
to
the
national
office.
the
other
half
is
kept
local.
there
are
other
contracted
digits
they
had
as
well.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
where
he
--
he
called
a
mass
meeting
your
honor
of
the
savannah
branch
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
the
law
--
there's
no
testimony
that
law
in
the
record
that
law
did
that
and
certainly
these
are
the
facts
on
which
the
respondent
attempts
to
show
because
of
the
circulars
that
n.a.a.c.p.
mass
meeting.
therefore,
the
reasoning
was
that
this
was
the
new
york
corporation
i
suppose,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
only
thing
that
law
could
do
is
to
call
a
meeting
for
savannah
branch
because
that
was
the
only
thing
that
was
there.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
testimony
shows
that
the
new
york
corporation
did
not
know
either
about
the
picketing
or
about
anything
that
was
going
on
until
after
the
injunction
was
issued.
the
injunction
was
issued
and
suit
had
commenced.
the
new
york
corporation
was
then
notified
about
the
fact
that
this
was
going
on.
and
i
didn't
--
it
is
the
position
of
the
--
currently
adopted
by
the
court
and
the
position
of
the
respondent
and
that
the
new
york
corporation
was
required
to
come
into
court
and
disavow.
we
think
that
--
we
think
that
is
error.
the
question
that
we
--
we
don't
believe
that
we
were
required
at
that
time
to
come
into
court
and
tell
the
court
or
tell
the
respondent
in
court
in
the
suit
--
lawsuit
that
we
disavow
the
local
branch
and
we
had
no
responsibility
for
it
because
it
seems
to
us
that
what
would
really
be
having
then
is
that
we
prejudice,
the
position
of
the
local
branch
in
regard
to
the
case.
i
think
that
the
disavowment
or
the
opportunity
to
affirm
or
disavow
has
to
occur
before
the
lawsuit
has
occurred
and
i
don't
believe
that
anyone
can
pick
up
the
fact
that
we
didn't
take
the
position
in
the
courtroom
after
the
lawsuit
itself
as
being
the
basis
for
it
and
this
is
what
--
in
our
--
this
is
where
in
our
judgment
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
was
in
error
in
trying
to
fix
that
instead
of
--
as
far
as
we
were
concerned.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
don't
believe
that
we
were
required
to
do
that
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law.
we
don't
believe
that
--
we
don't
--
we
believe
that
the
question
of
affirming
was
disavowed.
i
--
that
the
principle
therefore
the
responsibility
is
a
fact
which
has
to
occur
before
the
litigation
commencement.
now,
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
--
we
don't
read
that
that
is
a
--
is
saying
that
because
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
said
it
in
terms
of
interpreting
the
record
here.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
apparently
reaches
the
conclusion
with
regard
to
the
record
that
we
had
an
opportunity.
now
we
think
it's
an
error
that
we
had
an
opportunity
before
the
lawsuit
began.
if
this
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
is
saying
we
do
think
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
i
think
that
what
occurs
is
that
we
are
now
in
a
position
in
regard
to
our
units
where
we
require
the
principles
as
charged
with
a
liability
where
we're
required
to
come
in
court
and
prejudice
the
rights
of
our
affiliates
in
a
particular
litigation
by
making
a
confession
of
some
kind
in
court
in
regard
to
the
amount
of
resort.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
if
they
are
not
--
or
if
they
are
our
agents
or
if
they're
not
our
agents
our
theory
is
that
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
establish
his
case.
the
plaintiff
it
seems
to
me
has
to
come
into
a
court
and
he
makes
--
he
wants
damages
and
he
says
that
these
people
have
done
something
wrong.
i
think
that
he
has
to
establish
--
he
is
required
to
make
the
establishment
before.
the
respondent
has
any
duty
of
going
forward
or
making
any
explanation
with
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
think
that's
--
we
think
that's
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
we
think
that
that's
--
we
think
justice
stewart
that's
what
the
records
reveal.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
the
reason
for
the
--
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
on
page
17
we
--
and
beyond
we
are
showing
that
we
read
the
law
that
there
has
been
a
complete
departure
from
the
rules
established
in
georgia
and
we
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
this
may
raise
some
question
of
equal
protection.
but
our
theory
is
about
this
cases
that
there
is
no
evidence,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
would
connect
us
to
this
case
and
therefore
the
judgment
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
as
a
matter
of
law
we
said
the
--
this
judgment
and
this
question
should
never
have
gone
to
the
jury
and
it
should
have
been
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
new
york
corporation
was
not
present
and
is
not
responsible.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
and
under
these
circumstances
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
black
i
can
answer
that.
i
can
tell
you
what
-
i
can
tell
you
what
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
i'm
not
claiming
here
that
under
no
circumstances
can
a
case
be
made
whether
the
new
york
corporation
would
have
responsibility
for
some
act
that's
done
and
carried
out
locally.
i
am
saying
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
a
nexus
between
us
and
these
local
activities.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
claimant,
the
plaintiff
is
the
one
who
has
to
prove
the
case
and
has
to
present
evidence
to
show
the
responsibility
and
this
is
--
this
is
the
--
as
i
understand
the
law
that
this
is
what
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
is
the
law
of
georgia,
has
been
the
law
of
georgia
as
far
as
we
know
until
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
sustained
--
they
sustained
this
judgment,
yes
sir.
they
have
sustained
this
judgment,
but
we
think
that
in
sustaining
this
judgment
they
have
departed
from
basic
due
process
requirements.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
our
basic
claim
is
that
this
is
a
case
that
comes
within
the
thompson
versus
louisville
case.
that
there
isn't
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
i
think
that's
an
arbitrary
rule
under
--
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
because
of
two
things.
one,
mr.
law
testified
that
the
new
york
corporation
didn't
know
anything
about
what
was
going
on
that's
in
the
record.
they
weren't
notified.
they
knew
nothing
about
it
until
after
the
suit
was
filed.
this
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
is
in
--
in
the
record
itself.
the
other
point
that
we
raised
in
regard
to
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
that's
true.
that
maybe
true
but
what
you're
talking
about
now
is
that
sort
of
--
is
a
general
agency
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
management
is
involved
in
the
organization.
therefore,
we
have
some
general
responsibility
and
under
these
circumstances
our
general
responsibility
we
suggest
to
the
court
in
terms
of
due
process,
the
only
way
on
which
the
savannah
and
mr.
law
were
held
liable
was
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
there
were
acts
which
were
violent
acts
which
violated
the
laws
that
there
were
threats
and
intimidation
and
therefore
that
--
it
would
have
to
be
shown
specifically
that
the
new
york
corporation,
the
principle
would
be
involved
in
giving
specific
ratification
or
firm
acclamation
and
a
pull
of
those
specific
acts
because
otherwise
the
one
is
--
it
is
-
it
is
all
for
violation
and
there
are
arguments
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
these
are
the
allegations
that
has
been
made
that
he
was
acting
for
the
new
york
corporation
and
so
forth
but
as
i
try
to
indicate
before
there
has
been
no
showing
of
the
--
it
was
the
acting
clause
and
if
you
take
the
basis
on
which
responsibility
has
been
held
since
the
illegal
acts
and
acts
of
violence
i
think
that
we
have
to
indicate
that
the
new
york
corporation
in
carrying
out
a
general
policy
of
who
to
condone
ourselves
before
this
--
we
could
be
held
liable
under
this
circumstances.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
under
--
if
you
go
as
far
as
you've
indicated
that
the
georgia
can
go
and
that
is
that
the
agency
can
be
established
merely
by
the
fact
that
the
man
is
--
that
we
have
an
affiliate
that
the
man
is
a
member
of
the
organization.
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
if
the
manager
of
our
atlanta
branch
was
being
--
would
be
very
definitely
be
or
directly
connected
with
us
we
are
paying
him,
we
are
employing
him,
he
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
ordinary
rules
he
would
be
acting
for
us
on
the
circumstances
because
he
has
a
direct
--
we
give
him
orders.
we
are
able
to
tell
him
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
let
me
say
--
can
we
say
this
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
review
it
would
have
--
if
the
savannah
branch
i
mean
if
this
man
that
you
indicate
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
atlanta
were
to
come
out
and
were
to
be
on
the
picket
line
and
violence
and
so
forth,
it
were
established
one
that
he
was
employed
by
us
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
we
would
then
be
under
an
obligation
it
seems
to
me
at
that
point
to
establish
in
the
records,
specifically
in
the
record
that
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
or
to
attempt
to
disprove
his
association
and
that
he
was
operating
outside
the
scope
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
but
they
assumed
they're
carrying
out
the
policy
of
the
local
level.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
--
there
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
is
not
subject
to
our
control.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
contrary
to
our
basic
policy.
and
one
of
the
basic
--
basic
policies,
yes.
but
i
have
attempted
to
tell
-
to
say
to
you
that
generally
that
they
have
local
aims
and
objectives
which
they
presumed
which
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
terms
of
controlling
because
our
general
policy
is
in
terms
of
the
status
of
negroes
and
this
is
what
our
business
is,
on
the
national
level.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
think
that's
established
in
the
record.
i
think
what
is
shown
is
that
we
have
an
annual
convention
and
that
the
annual
convention,
he
and
other
people
go
to
our
conventions
which
are
held
annually
and
they
talk
about
various
things
about
the
--
that
ought
to
be
done
in
a
national
effort
so
that
our
policy
in
favor
of
the
voting
rights
field,
always
in
favor
of
their
civil
rights
bill.
we
wanted
[inaudible]
but
there
is
no
showing
that
he
went
down
with
counsel
to
do
any
of
the
things
that
are
here.
