justice
potter
stewart
your
case
i
suppose
would
and
maybe
you've
already
in
fact
said
this
that
--
now
let's
assume
a
state
or
a
community
where
the
public
schools
had
been
freely
opened
and
qualify
children
on
a
racially
unsegregated
basis,
but
if
in
the
neighborhood
of
--
group
of
toughs
just
decided
we're
not
going
to
let
this
negro
children
go
out
on
the
sidewalk
to
get
the
school
bus
this
morning
because
we
don't
believe
in
non-segregated
schools.
i
suppose
those
people
who
conspired
to
keep
those
kids
from
getting
to
school
would
be
guilty
on
either
theory,
would
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
was
to
that
purpose
to
keep
them
from
going
to
the
school.
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
an
unsegregated
school.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
reading
from
a
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
