justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
mr.
solicitor,
do
i
correctly
understand
you
in
the
substance
to
say
this
that
however,
further
it
may
go
in
terms
of
power
with
the
congress
to
do
so
and
under
an
allegation
which
you
say
here
it
relates
not
only
to
the
murder
of
this
chap
on
the
highway,
but
an
indictment
would
say
that
these
individuals
to
the
did
of
other
things,
beating,
damaging
and
destroying
property,
pursuing
negroes
in
automobiles,
making
telephone
calls
and
all
of
that,
all
to
the
end
of
discouraging
exercise
of
rights
as
would
tend
to
the
segregated
school.
something
which
the
state
itself
is
trying
to
bring
about
i
think
you
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
at
least
to
that
extent,
241
is
an
exercise
of
--
constitutional
exercise
of
congressional
power
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i'm
--
you
said
that
--
as
i
understood
you
that
they
acted
a
lot
of
vagueness
or
commit
this
--
again
the
combination
of
schools
and
mr.
justice
douglas
opinion
of
william.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
wanted
to
get
is--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
aren't
there
decisions
in
the
cruikshank
line
at
least
which
might
be
say
the
least,
not
support
your
constitutional
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
terms
of
vagueness,
what's
the
gloss
that's
been
on
241?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
whole
business
to
avoid
for
vagueness
that
goes
to
the
point
where
there
--
one
has
adequate,
know
this
before
he
commits
certain
conduct
but
that
conduct
does
--
made
a
crime
under
certain
law.
would
this
sort
of
things
under
some
of
the
older
cases
have
led
one
to
think
before
he
committed
it
that
he
had
committed
a
federal
crime
under
241.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
remember
the
troubles
mr.
solicitor
general
we
had
with
the
wilcox
and
[inaudible]
you
know
that
so
to
speak,
and
the
problems
we
had
in
james
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
think
there's
anything
like
that
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
those
prosecutions
mr.
solicitor
general
were
under
--
or
any
of
them
under
241?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
were
no
prosecutions
under
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
ask
mr.
justice
a
good
question
that
yes,
in
that
situation
that
could
be
a
prosecution
under
241?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
understand
then
mr.
solicitor
general
what
you're
suggesting
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
at
all
events
without
reference
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
indictment
can
be
sustained
on
the
allegations
that
did
utter
was
the
right
to
travel
freely,
that's
the
crandall
and
nevada
created
federal
rights,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
ask
you
to
give
up
anything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
asking
whether
without
--
you're
suggesting
that
to
that
extent
in
answering
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fortas,
that
this
indictment
should
have
been
sustained,
because
to
that
extent
without
regard
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
an
interference
with
the
federal
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor
gentleman,
may
i
ask
if
supplementing
that,
i
heard
you
i
think
say
that
right
to
access
the
facilities
at
the
school
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
–
is
a
privilege
and
immunity,
did
i
hear
you
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
these
rights
guaranteed
whatever
they
may
encompass
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
are
you
suggesting
that
they
come
in
the
category
like
the
right
to
travel
under
crandall
and
nevada
protected
by,
not
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
section
2
of
article
4,
“the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
the
a
whole
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
sovereign
states.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
and
you're
arguing
--
but
you
are
arguing
is
paragraph
3,
aren't
you
on
crandall,
or
4
rather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
crandall
and
nevada.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
wrong,
i
haven't
read
it
sometime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
that
rest
on
article
4,
section
2?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
on
the
commerce
book?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
wrong?
i
just
--
i
thought
crandall
had
also
dealt
with
this
right
of
travel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact,
that
was
tax
wasn't
it
against
passengers
on
a
train
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
didn't
say
it
implicate
article
4,
section
2?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
waste
your
time
on
it
and
i
hope
–
in
any
event
even
if
whether
they
did
or
not,
you're
not
making
that
argument
as
regard
to
the
general
rights
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
got
me
off
the
track
was
i
think
you
said
something
about
privileges
and
immunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
justice
clifford
dissented
on
the
ground
that
it
should
have
been
put
under
the
commerce
clause
as
i
recall.
incidentally,
one
the
facts,
there
so
much
discussion
to
that
opinion
of
back
and
forth
to
watch
it,
cheat
the
government
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
we
were
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wheeler
has
followed
crandall
and
as
i
thought
i've
had
it
before
me,
crandall
before
me,
a
great
emphasis
here
on
the
right
of
people
to
come
to
washington
has
preceded
the
national
government.
and
this
was
the
context
in
which
it
was
suggesting
that
this
was
a
national
privilege
and
that
was
the
ground
to
follow
which
mr.
justice
clifford
dissented
because
he
thought
not
on
that
fact
but
rather
on
the
commerce
clause,
within
the
commerce
clause.
it
would
have
to
be
found
the
national
rights
effectively.
certainly
the
court
in
that
case
and
nothing
wheeler
overruled
that,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
where
--
where
does
that
--
where
does
that
leave
you
at
least
that
regards
paragraph
4
--
3
and
4
of
the
indictment
on
your
argument
as
to
vagueness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
is
that
just
this
isn't
so.
crandall
and
nevada
is
still
law
and
there
couldn't
be
any
question
of
vagueness
in
respect
to
that
allegation
fulfilled
in
the
light
of
crandall,
one
of
these
other
cases
have
to
do
without
that
and
whether
crandall
