mr.
thurgood
marshall
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
mentioned
to
the
court
in
this
case
we
are
limited
again
to
the
allegation
indictment
and
in
this
indictment
it
charges
six
individuals,
which
engaged
in
a
criminal
conspiracy
in
violation
of
241.
none
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
alleged
to
hold
public
office,
nor
any
of
them
alleged
to
be
acting
under
color
of
the
law.
i
think
the
indictment
that
very
well
could
be
read,
because
it's
very
short.
after
the
beginning
thought,
the
charge
is
the
one
that
to
deny
the
rights
to
the
foreign
equal
enjoyment
of
good
services,
facilities,
privileges,
advantages
and
an
accommodations
of
motion
picture
theaters,
restaurants
and
other
places
of
public
accommodation.
and
two,
the
right
to
the
equal
utilization
without
discrimination
upon
the
basis
of
race
of
public
facilities
in
the
vicinity
of
athens,
georgia,
owned,
operated
or
managed
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
georgia
or
any
subdivision
thereof.
and
three,
the
right
to
the
full
and
equal
use
on
the
same
terms
as
white
citizens
of
the
public
streets
and
highways
in
the
vicinity
of
athens,
georgia.
four,
the
right
to
travel
freely
to
and
from
the
state
of
georgia
and
to
use
highway
facilities
and
other
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
within
the
state
of
georgia,
and
five,
other
rights
exercised
and
enjoyed
by
white
citizens
in
the
vicinity
of
athens,
georgia.
and
i
say
at
this
point
that
the
government
agrees
with
everybody
else
that
five
adds
nothing
to
the
indictment,
it
could
very
well
be
left
out.
it
was
a
part
of
a
plan
it
's
alleged,
it
was
a
part
of
the
plan
and
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
that
its
objects
be
achieved
by
various
means
including
the
following,
shooting
negroes,
beating
negroes,
killing
negroes,
by
damaging
and
destroy
property
of
negroes,
by
pursuing
negroes
in
automobiles
and
threatening
them
with
guns,
by
making
telephone
calls
to
negroes
to
threaten
their
lives,
property,
and
persons,
and
by
making
such
threats
in
person,
by
going
in
disguise
on
the
highway
and
on
the
premises
of
other
persons,
by
causing
the
arrest
of
negroes
by
means
of
false
reports
that
such
negroes
had
committed
criminal
acts,
and
by
burning
crosses
at
night
in
public
view
all
in
violation
of
241
and
the
district
court
in
a
very
extended
opinion,
sustained
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
to
all
the
defendants.
now
it's
obvious
that
the
indictment
charge
is
single
conspiracy,
generally
directed
at
preventing
negroes
from
exercise
and/or
enjoying
their
civil
rights.
we
take
the
position
that
the
national
government
had
the
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
authorize
punishment
of
conspiracies
having
the
specific
purpose
of
preventing
negroes
from
enjoying
the
public
facilities,
opened
up
to
them
by
a
state
pursuant
to
section
1
of
the
same
amendment
and
that's
exactly
what
the
congress
did.
mr.
justice
holmes
50
years
ago
said,
“the
other
sections
have
been
repealed
speaking
of
the
ku
klux
klan
sections,
but
section
19
it
maybe
said
much
mean
what
it
meant
in
1870
when
the
enforcement
act
was
passed
and
what
it
did
mean
will
be
seen
more
clearly
from
the
original
words.
the
source
of
this
section,
the
doings
of
the
ku
klux
klan
and
the
like
is
obvious.
the
acts
of
violence
obviously
were
on
the
minds
of
congress.
naturally,
the
congress
put
forth
all
its
powers
but
this
section
dealt
with
federal
rights
and
with
all
federal
rights
and
protected
them
in
the
law,”
“all
of
the
federal
rights
and
protected
them
in
the
law.”
in
other
words
the
congress
did
the
best
it
could
by
using
the
broad
language.
now,
the
rights
here
involved
are
spelled
out
in
the
indictment
and
they
fall
into
three
main
categories,
first,
rights
grounded
in
the
equal
protection
clause,
specifically
the
right
to
the
equal
utilization
without
discrimination
upon
the
basis
of
race
of
all
public
utilities
owned,
operated
or
managed
by
the
state
including
the
streets
and
highways
et
cetera.
secondly,
the
right
to
travel
freely
to
and
from
any
state
and
the
right
to
use
its
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce,
three,
the
right
to
equal
advantages
of
restaurants,
motion
picture
theaters
and
other
privately
owned
places
of
public
accommodation
guaranteed
by
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
right
to
the
nondiscriminatory
use
of
public
facilities
owned
or
operated
by
the
state
itself
is
one
grounded
in
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
again
in
the
light
of,
i
have
here
united
states
v.
williams
but
i
should
add,
in
the
light
of
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
united
states
versus
williams,
the
threshold
question
with
respect
to
this
branch
of
the
case
is
whether
section
241
protects
fourteenth
amendment
rights
at
all.
the
district
judge
said
no.
for
an
affirmative
answer
on
the
issue
we
rely
upon
the
brief
in
the
case
we've
just
argued,
but
in
addition
we
say,
“following
the
legislative
history,
we
show
and
operate
that
section
241
was
meant
to
reach
private
individuals
acting
in
conspiracy
and
once
you
apply
the
strict
requirements
of
the
screws
case
we
urged
that
so
construed
the
statute
is
not
impermissibly
vague.”
the
heart
of
the
case
is
easily
laid
bare.
appellees
are
charged
with
the
conspiracy
to
use
force
and
violence
for
this
specific
purpose
of
preventing
negroes
from
daring
to
use
the
park,
swimming
pools,
other
facilities
which
the
state
of
georgia
had
a
constitutional
duty
and
was
prepared
to
afford
them
equally
with
its
white
citizens.
the
identical
situation
might
well
arise
with
respect
to
schools.
if
a
state
maintains
a
public
school
system
it
must
open
the
door
to
negroes
within
the
area
it
serves
as
well
as
the
white
people.
for
the
school
authorities,
the
bar
[inaudible]
because
the
race
is
a
plain
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
the
question
here
is
simply
whether
the
united
states
may
also
remove
the
obstruction
interposed
by
daniel
tucks
who
stand
outside
the
door
and
because
of
race
keep
the
negro
children
from
approaching
it
or
who
as
in
the
present
case
roam
the
neighborhood,
threatening
with
violence
any
negro
family
with
six
fabulous
children
enjoy
the
unsegregated
education
which
the
state
has
a
constitutional
duty
to
provide
and
which
it
is
providing.
and
our
answer
is
that
this
united
states
has
this
power
and
it
has
this
power
as
an
adjunct
of
its
right
and
duty
to
enforce
the
state's
obligation
to
provide
equal
educational
facilities
without
segregation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
i
think
the
language
in
the
wardell
case
clears
it
up
pretty
well.
the
united
states
versus
wardell,
this
court
said
“the
right
here
guaranteed
is
not
the
mere
right
of
protection
against
personal
violence.”
this
is
the
result
of
an
ordinary
quarrel
or
malice
would
be
kind
of
blended
laws
of
the
state
and
by
the
courts.
we
are
not
urging
it
at
all
and
later
on
i'll
give
exactly
what
we
say
for
example,
if
these
same
defendants
in
this
case
just
went
out
and
solely
because
they
didn't
like
negroes,
they
shot
and
murdered
one,
that
wouldn't
be
under
the
statute,
wouldn't
be
on
ether
one
of
course
and
i
doubt
that
congress
would
have
that
power.
i
think
that
the
--
we
take
no
quarrel
with
the
position,
that
the
right
to
punish
for
murder
is
inherently
the
state's
job
to
do.
we
don't
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
federal
government
can
only
move
in
if
the
state
doesn't
do
it.
we
say
that
these
are
two
rights
which
we're
talking
about.
one
is
the
--
that
once
the
state
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
pursuant
to
the
requirement
under
the
first
section
abolishes
segregation
and
discrimination
of
all
kinds
then
once
they
do
that
then
the
congress
under
the
fifth
section
had
the
right
to
make
sure
it
worked.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
it
was
--
for
the
purpose
of
denying
to
this
people
their
rights.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
for
two
reasons.
one,
is
it
is
true
that
in
this
particular
area
the
state
is
acting
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
problem
there
as
to
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
intimidation.
you
see
that
the
crime
would
never
come
up.
there's
no
need
to
intimidate
somebody
if
the
state
is
preventing
it.
if
the
state
policeman
says
“you
can't
come
down
this
street,
there's
no
need
for
the
private
individual
to
tell
you,
you
can't
go.”
but
when
the
state
says
you
are
welcome
to
come
down
the
street
and
you're
welcome
to
go
in
this
building
then
the
private
individual
sometimes
lose
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
no
sir.
i
would
say
it
would
not
reach
it.
i'm
merely
saying
that
in
this
case
we
have
the
facts
which
makes
it
a
stronger
case,
but
i
didn't
mean
at
all
to
say
that
it
wouldn't
have
applied
before,
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
think
it
as
one
of
the
[inaudible]
ones.
when
a
group
of
private
citizens
get
together
and
say
“look,
we
are
going
to
plan
all
of
these
out
for
the
purpose
we're
just
sick
and
tired
of
what's
going
on
and
we're
going
to
do
it
and
somebody
would
suggest
to
bomb
a
church
like
they
did
in
birmingham,
somebody
say
“do
this
like
they
did
in
this,
why
not
do
that”
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
don't
have
to
do
all
of
these
things
to
come
under
it,
but
where
they
have
all
of
these
charged,
i
think
we
intend
to
rely
on,
and
i
don't
see
the
great
magnitude
that
comes
out
of
the
state
officers
of
being
involved,
i
just
never
had.
but
this
is
a
conspiracy
of
private
individuals.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
the
way
that
this
conspiracy
charges
worded
here
it's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
now
being
passed
in
fear.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't.
it
do
not
support,
and
there
is
considerable
language
which
is
opposed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
vagueness
--
the
vagueness
point
we
say
was
removed
by
carefully
drawing
this
indictment
within
the
schools
in
williams's
opinions.
as
i
read
it,
and
i
was
not
around
when
it
was
drafted
but
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
my
position
is
that
even
if
it
would
fall
afoul
of
the
language
in
cruikshank
et
cetera,
it
is
definitely
within
the
specific
the
language
in
screws
as
interpreted
by
the
four
judges
and
mr.
justice
douglas
opinion.
they
said
that
conspiracy
puts
the
necessary
intent.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
it's
a
problem.
i
recognize
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
this
one
is
drawn,
i
believe
that
it
can
be
upheld
under
the
two
cases.
i
mean
that's
my
position
on
it
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
our
position
and
that
they're
conspired
to
do
it.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
relationship
between
private
people
or
the
protection
of
any
particular
class
of
people
against
private
violence
which
has
been
mentioned
or
the
tortuous
conduct
as
a
matter
of
fact.
if
a
state
were
to
withhold
from
any
class
the
equal
protection
laws,
the
congress
would
undoubtedly
have
the
power
to
act
under
section
5.
the
indi
--
indictment
here
makes
no
such
allegation
and
we
do
not
pitch
our
case
on
that
theory.
our
case
is
built
upon
the
federal
duty
of
the
state,
when
it
provides
public
facilities
to
provide
them
equally
and
the
defendants
are
charged
with
conspiring
to
use
violence
and
intimidation
with
the
specific
intent
of
barring
negroes
from
the
fulfillment
of
their
correlative
federal
right
to
the
equal
enjoyment
of
facility
provided
by
the
state
on
an
equal
basis.
that
we
say
it's
the
power
granted
in
section
5
of
the
amendment
to
enforce
the
guarantee
of
equal
treatment
by
the
state
extends
the
prevention
of
those
interferences
by
third
persons
which
are
specifically
aimed
at
frustrating
the
enjoyment
of
their
constitutional
assurance.
those
are
the
only
ones
we're
interested
in.
this
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
as
i
read
it
--
i
did
not
--
it
just
says
that
the
state
is
open
to
facilities
and
they
are
going
against
it.
i
don't
--
our
case
is
not
based
on
any
allegation
about
the
state
one
way
or
the
other
expect
that
the
state's
doing
it
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
the
state
has
recognized
that
at
least
that
at
least
the
indictment,
the
state
is
operating
and
the
difference
about
as
mentioned
about
no
body
showing
a
badge,
i'd
never
thought
too
much
of
that
when
you
call
up
a
sheriff
and
ask
him
to
come
in,
get
into
conspiracy
and
to
deny
somebody
their
constitutional
rights
and
the
sheriff
says,
“wait
a
minute
i'd
take
my
badge
off.”
we're
dealing
with
individuals.
here
we
have
the
state
opening
up
and
the
state
has
certain
responsibilities,
but
once
the
state
owns
it
up
nobody
should
be
allowed
to
prevent
the
negro
from
getting
his
right.
it's
not
the
state
that's
benefiting
under
this.
it's
the
individual
citizen
who
gets
that
right,
if
the
state
bars
it
we
come
into
this
court
and
this
court
says
you
have
to
stop
it.
if
the
state
says
“well,
we'll
go
ahead
and
do
what
we're
supposed
to
do
and
break
it
down,”
and
hoodlums
do
the
things
charged
in
this
indictment
then
what
happens,
the
rights
are
nullity
and
obviously
when
you
read
senator
pool
--
that's
what
senator
pool
was
talking
about.
he
knew
this
would
happen.
i
don't
know
whether
he
expected
it
to
wait
this
long
to
happen,
but
for
as
i
read
it
he
expected
that
to
happen.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
could
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
that
was
the
hoxie
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
hoxie
case
and
all
of
those
cases
down
in
tennessee
that
i
don't
think
any
of
them
came
up
here,
but
they
were
all
on
that
and
the
local
courts
granted
relief
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
ringleader
went
to
jail.
we
also
had,
we're
also
aware
of
the
little
rock
problem.
i
mean
the
government's
not
powerless
in
this
situation,
but
the
only
thing
here
is
they
take
no
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
was
that
came
to
[inaudible]?
what
was
it?
a
contempt?
it
was
contempt,
hoxie
was
contempt.
well
yes,
i
remember
yes,
the
district
court
gave
an
injunction
in
knoxville,
i
think
it
was
and
casper
violated
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
this
was
contempt
that's
why
i
say
it
does
--
it
doesn't
apply
here
to
help
us.
it
was
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
see
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
so,
i
should
think
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
that
was
the
old
fourteenth
amendment.
in
strauder
an
ex
parte
of
virginia,
and
even
in
[inaudible]
case
everybody
recommend
--
recognize
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
yes
sir
but
to
pick
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
it
says
equal
protection.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
discuss
crandall
and
nevada,
pretty
exhaustively
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
know,
this
is
45,
isn't
it?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
my
answer
is
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
have
it
starting
on
page
57.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
i
take
the
position
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
giving
up
anything
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
if
crandall
still
means
what
i
think
it
means
and
i
admit
quite
frankly
that
there's
quite
a
few
people
who
don't
agree
with
us
on
what
we
think
crandall
means,
but
on
the
--
we
didn't
mention
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
we
do
say
full
and
equally
enjoined
it
said
and
obviously
we
are
relying
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
at
this
point
that
we
would
prefer
that
the
court
consider
all
of
the
rights
as
we
have
set
them
out
in
the
indictment
because
this
is
merely
the
indictment
stage
and
when
it
gets
back
assuming
that
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
problems
not
only
of
proof
but
wait
what
goes
to
the
jury
and
what
doesn't
go
to
the
jury
will
of
course
be
taken
up
by
the
trial
court.
at
this
stage
we
are
at
loss
as
to
know
just
what
evidence
will
come
in
or
what
the
evidence
will
show.
but
the
indictment
alleges
a
conspiracy
forcibly
to
prevent
negroes
because
of
their
race
from
enjoying
equally
with
their
civil
rights
including
among
others
the
benefit
of
the
public
facilities,
streets
and
highways.
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
rights
here
are
asserted
are
rights
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
briefs
we
spell
out
all
of
the
areas
on
page
11
of
our
brief.
i
mentioned
before
this
right
is
grounded
in
the
equal
protection
clause
but
the
district
court
held
that
section
241
did
not
encompass
fourteenth
amendment
rights
at
all.
so
once
again,
we
come
back
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
in
the
williams
case
which
recognized
the
specific
rights
secured
by
the
fourteenth
and
mid
--
fifteenth
amendments
as
being
rights
within
the
scope
for
section
241.
with
that
in
mind,
we
have
argued
in
the
price
case
due
process
rights
were
also
included.
no
one
has
suggested
a
satisfactory
basis
for
excluding
equal
protection
rights
while
still
keeping
due
process
rights,
either
should
be
a
right
of
privilege
secured
by
the
constitution
which
is
using
the
like
of
section
241.
section
241
when
applied
the
voting
cases.
there's
no
question
that
it
was
a
clearly
covered
conspiracies
by
private
individuals
as
well.
we
convinced
that
the
same
applied
to
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
and
getting
back
to
senator
pool,
he
pointed
out
that
individuals
may
prevent
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
suffrage,
individuals
may
prevent
the
enjoyment
of
other
rights
which
are
conferred
upon
the
citizen
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
trespass
et
cetera.
our
argument
proceeds
in
three
direct
stages.
first,
we
take
the
position
that
federal
powered
plainly
extends
to
dealing
with
those
who
intentionally
obstruct
federal
officials
in
performing
a
duty
which
is
imposed
on
them
by
law
and
i'm
of
course
referring
to
the
logan
case.
there,
the
court
sustained
the
conviction
under
the
predecessors
of
section
241
of
the
leader
the
mob
who
attacked
and
killed
the
prisoner
who
of
course
was
in
the
custody
of
the
united
states
marshall.
grounds
of
the
decision
whether
the
united
states
and
the
marshall
had
a
duty
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
to
protect
the
prisoners
in
their
custody,
and
therefore,
the
congress
had
the
power
to
punish
those
private
citizens
who
interfered
with
that.
our
second
point
is
that
the
same
rule
applies
to
those
who
obstruct
state
officials
and
the
government
--
or
in
the
performance
of
their
duty
which
was
also
imposed
by
the
government
--
constitution
namely
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
duty
of
the
state
to
make
the
same
public
facilities
open
to
all
races
without
discrimination
imposed
by
the
equal
protection
clause
and
it
is
a
federal
duty
and
the
power
to
enforce
that
federal
duty
surely
extends
as
in
the
logan
case
the
sweeping
away
all
obstructions
to
its
performance
intentionally
raised
by
private
persons.
the
basic
point
is
therefore
rather
simple.
just
as
there
is
constitutional
power
to
punish
aggression
against
federal
officers
and
of
preventing
their
performance
of
their
federal
duties,
so
may
the
congress
punish
private
interference
designed
to
impede
or
frustrate
state
officials
in
the
performance
of
their
federal
duties
which
came
about
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
thirdly,
we
urge
that
the
united
states
has
the
same
power
to
deal
with
private
conspiracies
intended
to
defeat
enjoyment
of
the
federal
constitutional
right
as
it
has
to
reach
conspiracies
aimed
at
thwarting
the
state's
performance
of
its
federal
constitutional
duties.
one
must
be
certain
of
course
that
the
private
conduct
is
specifically
aimed
at
the
employment
of
the
federal
right
to
equal
protection
at
the
hands
of
the
state
or
to
purpose
its
private
racial
discrimination,
no
federal
right
in
duty
in
the
absence
of
statute
is
involved.
here
the
heart
of
conspiracy
is
alleged
to
be
barring
negroes
from
enjoying
that
equal
access
to
public
facilities
which
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
and
the
states
was
apparently
ready
to
to
afford,
almost
already
affording.
under
these
circumstances,
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
frustrating
the
performance
of
their
federal
duty
and
barring
enjoyment
of
the
correlative
federal
right.
united
states
against
wardell
is
squarely
in
point.
in
that
case,
the
man
was
trying
to
perfect
his
right
on
homestead
land
and
he
was
interfered
with
by
private
individuals.
now
as
i
mentioned
before
the
logan
case
is
in
the
same
category.
interference
with
the
reciprocal
relationship
by
coercion
or
provider
would
be
punished.
the
argument
runs
but
not
interference
by
cohesion
of
the
beneficiary.
the
fallacy
is
that
federal
interest
is
in
the
provision
and
the
enjoyment
of
the
state
facilities.
that's
the
federal
interest.
the
practical
objective
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
is
that
negroes
shall
receive
the
equal
opportunity
for
the
use
of
facilities
that
the
state
provides.
the
reciprocal
relation
between
a
federal
duty
to
furnish
protection
and
a
federal
right
to
enjoy
the
protection
owed
was
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
the
logan
case
where
it
was
said
“the
existence
of
that
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government
necessarily
implies
a
corresponding
right
on
the
part
of
the
prisoner
to
be
so
protective.”
and
this
right
of
the
prisoner
is
a
right
secured
to
them
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states.
so
here,
there
is
a
federal
right
which
defendants
conspired
to
take
away
from
georgia
negroes,
specifically
the
right
to
enjoy
the
public
facilities
furnished
to
them
without
discrimination.
we
recognize
of
course
that
most
of
the
cited
cases
involving
third
party
interference
was
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
persons
injured,
such
as
the
petition
for
interest
of
grievances,
filling
government
contracts
and
mostly
upon
public
lands
whereas
the
present
case
superficially
considered
seems
merely
to
involve
third
party
interference
with
relationship
between
the
persons
injured
in
the
states.
but
in
fact
however,
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
negroes
which
the
defendants
sought
to
intimidate,
the
relationship
with
the
defendants
intended
to
shatter
is
itself
created
by
the
federal
constitution.
thus,
the
interference
with
the
victims'
enjoyment
of
this
right
given
to
them
by
the
federal
government
is
interference
with
the
relationship
between
the
victims
and
the
federal
government
as
well
as
the
relationship
between
the
victims
in
the
states.
since
the
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws
includes
the
right
to
have
a
state
furnished
equal
access
to
public
facilities
that
right
too
is
a
privilege
in
the
immunity
of
citizens
of
the
united
states.
defendants
are
plainly
charged
with
a
conspiracy
to
interfere
with
the
negroes'
exercise
of
these
rights
of
equal
access
to
public
facilities
and
therefore,
are
charged
with
attempting
to
deprive
them
over
their
privilege
of
a
citizen.
the
power
of
the
congress
to
punish
conspiracies
to
deprive
one
of
their
privilege
or
immunity
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
beyond
dispute
and
on
that
point
even
the
cruikshank
case
recognized
that.
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
our
submission
and
the
doctrine
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
being
concerned
only
with
governmental
action
does
not
enlarge
the
right
of
private
citizens
among
themselves.
here,
the
indictment
alleges
explicitly
and
specifically
that
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
prevent
negroes
from
enjoying
the
opportunity
for
the
equal
use
of
the
property
and
the
state
had
offered
it
to
them.
that
specific
intent
is
the
critical
element
in
this
case.
the
word
absent,
the
wrong
might
well
be
only
an
instance
of
private
aggression
beyond
federal
power,
unless
the
state
were
shown
to
be
withholding
from
the
victims,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
which
is
not
this
case.
the
intent
however,
the
defendants'
acts
are
linked
to
the
state's
constitutional
obligation
and
become
interference
with
their
relationship
created
and
safeguarded
by
the
united
states.
that's
not
pure
theory
in
simple
practical
terms.
the
defendant's
alleged
aim
was
to
bar
desegregation
of
state
facilities
as
required
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
particularly,
we
like
to
put
aside
because
of
the
lack
of
a
specific
intent
all
instances
of
violence
resulting
from
private
cause.
if
all
that
appeared
was
that
a,
b
and
c
conspired
to
threaten
and
rob,
or
killed
for
personal
gain
or
revenge,
the
state
alone
could
have
jurisdiction
regardless
of
d's
race
or
color.
that
d
was
a
negro
incidentally
lost
the
opportunity
to
use
a
state
facility
would
be
no
more
relative
than
the
victim
of
another
murder
lost
the
opportunity
to
obtain
a
government
contract
of
take
a
homestead.
nor
would
a
general
showing
of
racial
antagonism
sufficed
if
the
state
we're
willing
and
able
to
extend
to
all
races
impartially
the
equal
protection
of
its
laws.
here,
the
conspiracy
is
alleged
to
have
been
specifically
aimed
at
barring
the
realization
of
the
right
to
equal
use
of
facilities
offered
by
the
state.
it
is
that
specific
intent
to
bar
their
enjoyment
of
a
constitutional
right
against
a
state
upon
which
rests
the
federal
power
in
the
present
case.
a
different
case
will
also
be
presented
if
the
objective
of
the
conspiracy
would
interfere
with
speech,
association
or
assembly.
although,
we
may
well
wish
to
argue
upon
a
later
occasion
that
the
federal
government
may
protect
men
against
private
violence
aimed
at
suppressing
speech,
association
or
political
activity
for
present
purposes,
we
may
assume
that
even
in
such
a
case
the
federal
government
could
not
constitutionally
interfere
if
the
state
were
supplying
equal
protection.
in
such
case,
there's
no
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
victims
beyond
the
obligation
to
provide
them
with
the
same
protection
as
other
citizens.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
the
reasoning
of
whether
i'm
not
talking
about,
i'm
talking
about
one
and
two.
i'm
not
at
four
and
whereas
i
--
we
obviously
would
not
be
able
to
cover
all
in
the
oral
argument.
i
will
get
to
it,
but
it
--
i
want
to
specifically
get
the
government's
position
clear.
we
take
the
position
that
each
one
of
the
rights
here
set
out
stands
on
an
equal
footing
and
we
are
not
abandoning
anyone
of
it.
but
the
equal
protection
clause
because
of
some
of
the
earlier
cases
is
the
more
difficult
one
to
--
at
least
we
thought
to
get
over
and
that's
why
i've
been
concentrating
on
that
one.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
do
abandon
paragraph
5
because
we
take
the
position
that
it
doesn't
add
anything
and
we
don't
need
it,
but
we
have
not
at
all
abandoning
the
argument
but
i
understood
when
i
answered
the
question
this
morning
that
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief
we
are
relying
on
the
crandall
case
and
the
crandall
case
alone
would
be
sufficient,
but
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
if
the
decision
were
adverse
on
just
the
one
point.
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
persuade
the
court
to
reverse
and
remand,
so
that
all
of
the
four
points
can
be
considered
by
the
trial
court
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
trial
court
to
decide
the
real
difference
with
number
4
is
what
type
of
evidence
would
be
produced,
i
don't
know.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
take
the
position
that
they
are
federal
rights
for
the
reason
that
the
access
to
them,
the
state
having
given
the
negroes
access
to
these
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
they
are
protected
by
the
federal
government.
they
are
not
state's
rights.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
of
course,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
problem
is
the
state
is
not
in
this
case
by
any
stretch
of
imagination.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
say
that
the
right
to
use
of
public
facilities
in
vicinity
of
athens
et
cetera
are
rights
which
are
secured
to
the
victims
in
this
case,
the
negroes
by
reason
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
not
by
the
reason
of
the
state.
now
that's
our
allegation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
guaranteed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir,
guaranteed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
by
article
1
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
our
position.
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
schools.
i'd
said
privilege
and
immunity
in
general
phrase.
i
don't
--
if
i
did,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
arguing
the
fourteenth
amendment?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
four,
it's
on
4.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
crandall
and
nevada.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
take
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
specifically
went
to
the
commerce
act
as
i
remember.
it
was
very
general.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir,
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
it's
our
position
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
go
right
here
at
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
we
take
the
position
--
well,
to
put
it
in
other
way,
we
take
the
position
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
are
just
as
important
as
any
of
the
others,
but
that
when
you
realize
that
this
particular
congressional
act
was
passed
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth,
obviously
they
meant
to
protect
fourteenth
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
they
also
protect
the
others
in
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
was
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
process
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
--
i
didn't
--
i
hope
i
didn't
mean
to
invoke
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
that.
we
say
that
–
the
only
reason
i
mentioned
fourteenth
amendment
is
because
241
was
passed
pursuant
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
say
that
some
of
them
are.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
only
one.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
only
one.
that's
the
restaurants
et
cetera,
but
not
the
schools.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
we
wouldn't
have
to.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
power
of
congress,
well,
that
as
i
understand
that
the
beginning
of
the
statute
puts
in
several
provision
including
them.
but
i
don't
need
that
the
2
--
for
2
and
3.
we
are
relying
mainly
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
absolutely.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
which
is
guaranteed
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
it
and
that
the
reason
they
do
have
that
right
is
because
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
this
conspiracy
had
aimed
at
preventing
them
from
exercising
this
federal
right
which
they
have.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right,
yes,
sir.
getting
back
to
the
lynching
one,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
harris,
us
against
harris
in
which
government
alleged
that's
clearly
distinguishable
upon
the
facts
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
was
an
allegation
of
racial
motivation
which
could
draw
the
equal
protection
in
play
and
second,
there
was
no
allegation
of
intent
to
deprive
party
of
any
constitutional
right.
indeed
there's
a
lot
of
distinction
between
lynching
is
even
when
racially
motivated
and
the
present
case.
while
the
lynch
mob
knows
that
it
is
preventing
the
state
from
according
to
victim
due
process
of
law,
but
they
may
not
intend
to
interfere
with
the
constitutional
right.
but
in
the
present
case,
the
court
according
to
the
indictment
bind
the
desegregation
of
state
own
facilities
was
a
sign
of
the
conspiracy.
and
apparently,
the
murder
of
the
deceased
was
simply
a
means
to
that
end.
whether
this
is
an
important
distinction
may
be
left
as
a
future
and
to
a
very
least
it
emphasized
the
word
narrow
holding
which
is
all
that
the
government
asks
in
the
present
case.
we
then
face
the
charge
that
241
if
it
is
to
reach
private
conspiracies
directed
against
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
would
fall
for
vagueness.
and
i
hope
that
these
decisions
and
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
screws
and
the
williams
case
had
settled
that,
but
the
decision
in
the
screws
case
set
forth
two
requirements
for
criminal
provision
generally
enforcing
the
due
process
or
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
due
process
--
but
equal
protection
was
mentioned.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
was
the
due
process,
in
fact,
there
was
a
criminal
charge
and
that
he
might
not
know
the
particular
police
officer
would
be
saying,
i
guess.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
was
getting
to
--
was
that,
it
was
two
points.
that
it
will
only
operate
against
an
offender
acting
with
a
specific
intent
to
infringe
the
right
and
two,
that
right
protected
had
been
made
definite
by
some
decisions
or
other
rule
of
law.
those
were
the
two
that
screws
set
forth
as
i
read
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
that's
all.
that's
an
order
for
it
to
be
a
due
process
in
order
for
it
to
fulfill
the
due
process
requirements,
it
has
to
do
that.
and
in
the
williams
case,
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
that
pointed
out
the
241
meets
the
first
requirement
by
virtue
of
being
a
conspiracy
statute.
the
provision
does
not
punish
merely
because
someone
was
causing
or
permitting
in
an
injurious
result
by
negligence
or
otherwise,
but
only
--
you
get
conspiracy
only
if
there's
a
purposeful
agreement
to
inflict
the
injury.
vagueness
is
not
imparted
because
the
statute
reaches
private
conspiracies
else
it
could
never
serve
its
most
traditional
function
as
for
example,
the
wardell
case
and
the
logan
case.

against
conspiracies
to
obstruct
the
enjoyment
of
a
“right
or
privilege
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
any
other
rights
secured
by
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution,
241
reaches
only
direct
purposeful
interference
with
the
exercise
or
enjoyment
of
the
right.”
the
true
scope
of
241
is
illustrated
by
the
present
indictment
which
alleges
a
conspiracy
of
violence
and
terror
explicitly
designed

prevent
