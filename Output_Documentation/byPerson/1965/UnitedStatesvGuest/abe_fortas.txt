justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
do
you
say
the
state
has
strike
first?
that
is
your
--
what
you
say.
justice
abe
fortas
state
may
act
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
state
has
to
act
first
before
the
federal
power
is
going
to
come
into
play?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
if
the
state's
policies
and
laws
permit
segregation
or
forbid
negroes
to
use
these
public
facilities
and
if
there
is
a
private
group
--
a
group
of
private
persons
who
interfere
with
the
negroes'
use
those
public
facilities,
would
it
be
your
position
that
the
federal
power
does
not
reach
those
[inaudible]
in
that
private
group?
justice
abe
fortas
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
this
en
bancment
in
the
guest
case
does
not
--
does
it
specifically
refer
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
so
many
words,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
well,
i'm
troubled
by
the
interrelationship
between
the
state
and
the
federal
and
so
i
followed
your
argument.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question?
“in
your
--
as
you
analyze
this,
whether
an
en
bancment
lie
under
section
241,
if
that
alleged
merely
that
two
or
more
persons
are
conspiring
to
infer
a
citizen
in
the
pre-exercise
of
his
right
to
travel
in
the
interstate
commerce,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
posture
a
direct
what
i
conceive
to
be
a
direct
federal
right
under
the
adams
theory.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
what's
troubling
me
because
i'm
confused
now
by
the
interrelationship
of
state
right,
federal
right
under
241
on
the
basis
of
what
you
have
said.
justice
abe
fortas
your
answer
is
that
section
indictment
could
be
properly
be
laid
under
section
241
--
justice
abe
fortas
only
a
direct
federal
right.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
general,
excuse
me
a
bit.
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
in
your
argument
that
you
are
ignoring
paragraph
4
in
the
indictment
and
with
it
–
and
i
wonder
if
you're
doing
that
deliberately
that
is
to
say
very,
very
poorly
indictment
excuses
the
defendants
were
conspiracy
to
deprive
these
persons
of
the
right
to
travel
to
and
from
the
state
of
georgia
and
the
use
of
highway
facilities
and
other
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
i've
asked
something
along
these
lines
before
but
your
argument
bewilders
me
is
respect
that
i
don't
know
just
where
in
your
scheme
of
reasoning
about
the
statute
that
particular
paragraph
fits.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
--
did
i
incorrectly
understand
you?
i
thought
you
were,
in
effect
abandoning
paragraph
5?
justice
abe
fortas
on
paragraphs
1,
2
and
3
of
the
indictment,
is
it
your
position
that
these
are
state
rights
within
the
language
of
section
241,
they
are
secured
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
on
your
position
that
they
are
federal
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
state
might
respond
that
the
state
has
given
these
people
access
to
the
streets
and
public
facilities
and
so
on,
on
the
basis
of
the
state's
own
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
your
argument
whether
the
state
is
here
or
not.
sure,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
in
effect
you're
saying
that
what
in
substance
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
connection
of
these
rights
and
the
language
of
section
241.
the
language
of
section
241
as
in
terms
of
rights
of
privileges
secured
to
him,
that
is
to
say
to
any
person
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
i
--
i
am
sure
it's
my
own
problem
here
(my
own
problem),
but
what
i
can't
get
to
is
your
precise
logic
by
which
you
relate
these
rights
to
that
phrase
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
the
rights
granted
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
--
they
come
within
the
phrase
secured
to
him
by
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
are
rights
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
position
is
that
since
these
rights
are
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
despite
--
whether
or
not
they
are
regarded
as
rights
conferred
by
the
state
that
they
come
within
the
language
of
section
241.
