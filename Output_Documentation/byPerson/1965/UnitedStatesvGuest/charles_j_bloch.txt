mr.
charles
j.
bloch
yes,
your
honors
please.
in
the
court
below
there
was
an
indictment
was
brought
against
six
defendants,
all
of
whom
are
here
as
appellees,
guest
and
five
others.
among
the
five
was
the
defendant
lackey,
i
have
the
honor
to
be
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
james
spergeon
lackey,
one
of
the
appellees
and
i
appear
here
for
him
alone.
although
there
is
no
conflict
of
interest
as
i
see
it
the
present
stage
of
the
case
then
raises
between
the
other
five
who
are
represented
by
mr.
hudson
and
mr.
lackey
whom
i
represent
by
appointment.
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
was
filed
in
march
1965
by
solicitor
general
cox,
the
first
of
the
questions
presented
is
thus
stated
whether
section
241
of
the
criminal
code
reaches
unofficial
conspiracies
against
the
exercise
of
rights
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
brief
of
the
government
filed
by
solicitor
general
marshall
in
september
of
1965,
the
first
of
the
questions
presented
is
thus
stated
whether
section
241
of
the
criminal
code
reaches
private
conspiracies
against
the
exercise
of
rights
secured
by
an
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
regardless
of
the
slight
change
in
the
wording,
the
essence
of
the
question
under
the
first
part
is
this.
does
section
241
reach
conspiracies
against
the
exercise
of
rights
secured
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
specifically,
does
it
do
it
when
no
state
action
whatsoever
is
involved?
now
the
other
two
questions,
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed
by
solicitor
general
cox,
page
3
that
which
is
now
become
question
3
in
the
brief
before
the
court
is
whether
section
241
reaches
unofficial
conspiracies
against
the
exercise
of
rights
secured
by
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
relating
to
places
of
public
accommodation.
the
other
question
is
stated
to
be
whether
section
241
reaches
unofficial
conspiracies
against
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
freely
enter
and
leave
the
state,
and
the
right
to
freely
use
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce.
under
the
plan
of
argument
that
mr.
hudson
and
i
had
agreed
upon.
i
was
to
argue
the
first
question
leaving
the
last
two
to
him,
but
before
commencing
the
argument
of
the
first
question,
i
have
this
suggestion
to
make
which
was
i
hope
fully
covered
in
the
brief
of
which
i
submitted
some
weeks
ago
and
which
i
have
not
heard
answer
either
by
a
brief
or
by
oral
argument
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
vice
of
vagueness
of
which
it
occurs
to
me
pervades
this
statute.
we
take
the
position
that
that
vice
of
vagueness
pervades
title
xviii,
section
241
even
when
standing
alone
because
as
it's
been
demonstrated
by
the
numbers
of
cases
which
had
been
before
this
court
on
the
question
and
the
number
of
cases
which
had
been
before
the
inferior
federal
courts,
the
question
of
what
is
a
right
secured
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
right
wide
open
question.
now,
that
vice
even
as
it
pertains
to
the
statute
standing
alone
is
intensified
all
of
the
law.
when
the
government
contends
that
as
here
as
i
understand
it
that
title
xvii,
section
241,
passed
back
in
1870
i
believe,
is
now
since
1964
supplemented
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
so
that
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
--
that
vice
of
vagueness
has
been
nowhere
better
described
than
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states.
in
this
court

solicitor

immediately
preceded

present

now,
recently
that

--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
no
sir.
i
was
reading
there
from
the
opinion
in
lanzetta
versus
new
jersey.
i
now
come
to
the
brief
filed
by
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
--
solicitor
general
cox.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
recently,
in
1964
this
court
has
decided
the
cases
of
griffin,
barr,
bouie,
bell
and
robinson,
all
in
the
378
u.
s.
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
filed
briefs
entitled
in
all
of
these
cases
in
september
1963.
it
was
submitted
by
the
honorable
archibald
cox,
solicitor
general,
greg
marshall,
assistant
attorney
general,
ralph
s.
spritzer,
and
louis
f.
clairborne,
assistants
to
the
attorney
general
and
harold
s.
greene
and
howard
a
glickston,
attorneys.
at
pages
26
and
27
of
that
briefs
they
wrote,
the
general
rule
is
plain.
before
a
man
can
be
punished,
his
case
must
be
plainly
within
the
state
--
it
would
be
in
the
statute.
the
vague
criminal
statute
violates
the
first
essential
of
due
process.
it
is
like
the
ancient
laws
of
caligula,
a
prep
for
the
innocent
citing
united
states
versus
cardiff
344
u.
s.
174,
176
which
i
believe
was
written
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
duty
of
warning
before
punishing
applied
equally
to
the
states.
the
fourteenth
amendment
imposes
upon
a
state
an
obligation
to
frame
it's
criminal
statutes
so
that
those
to
whom
they
are
addressed
may
know
what
standard
of
conduct
is
intended
to
be
required
citing
cases.
now
the
cardiff
cases
uses
this
specific
language
the
vice
of
vagueness
in
the
criminal
statute
is
the
treachery
they
conceal
either
in
determining
what
persons
are
included
or
what
acts
are
prohibited.
words
which
are
vague
and
fluid
compare
the
united
states
versus
colin
grocery
company,
maybe
as
much
of
a
crap
to
the
innocent
as
the
ancient
laws
of
caligula
and
there's
a
quotation
in
that
brief,
and
i
would
take
time
to
read
all
of
it
here,
it
appears
at
page
6
of
the
brief
which
i
filed
for
lackey
back
in
september,
at
page
35
is
a
quotation
from
professor
freud.
“the
objection
to
vagueness
is
twofold.
inadequate
guidance
to
the
individual
who's
conduct
is
regulated,
an
inadequate
guidance
to
the
triers
of
fact.
the
former
objection
could
not
be
cured
retrospectively
by
ruling
either
of
the
trial
court
or
the
appellate
court
although
it
might
be
cured
in
the
future
by
authority's
judicial
clause.”
i
leave
that
for
application
i
hope
by
the
court,
most
particularly
when
you
come
to
listen
to
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
second
and
third
questions
presented
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
because
as
one
of
the
justices
in
the
question
pointed
out
those
questions
are
his
inception
or
the
conception
of
the
drafts
of
the
indictment
of
what
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
prescribes.
as
i
read
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
the
prescriptions
of
it,
the
compulsions
of
it
are
quite
different
from
what
was
stated
in
questions
2
and
3,
but
that
simply
illustrates
the
question
of
vagueness.
so
that
i'd
come
back
to
the
question
which
was
assigned
to
me
and
that
is
what
is
meant
by
the
rights
secured
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
answer
can
only
be
the
right
of
any
person
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
not
to
be
deprived
by
that
state
to
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
now
that's
where
the
word
private
and
the
word
unofficial
in
the
statement
of
question
is
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
but
becomes
so
important
because
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
government
is
this
that
just
leaving
out
2
and
3
for
the
moment
that
he
takes
the
–
takes
the
categorical
position
that
in
the
case
like
this
that
the
private
persons
--
private
persons
maybe
the
state
in
depriving
another
persons
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
in
the
case
that
preceded
this
i
had
the
opportunity
to
hear
the
argument
in
the
case
that
preceded
this
and
in
this
case
too.
he
hinted
that
the
language
that
these
occur
--
both
on
the
language
of
senator
pool
of
north
carolina,
i
believe
he'd
said
it
was,
what
senator
pool
of
north
carolina
back
in
1860
--
1869
intended
the
equal
protection
clause
to
mean
or
thought
it
meant.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
this
were
the
case
of
first
impression,
i
don't
know
what
importance
the
court
would
attach
to
the
remarks
of
senator
pool.
suffice
it
to
say
that
whatever
cozette
they
may
have
had,
that
cozettcy
has
been
completely
wiped
out
by
repeated
decisions
of
this
court
beginning
in
1875,
seven
years
after
the
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
further
that
unbroken
line
of
decisions
commences
with
united
states
versus
cruikshank
to
which
illusion
was
made
before
noon,
92
u.
s.
542
written
by
chief
justice
waite.
he
was
a
native
of
ohio
in
1875
and
it
continues
down
to
the
very
latest
decisions
of
this
court.
now
in
that
opinion
handed
down
just
seven
years
after
the
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
chief
justice
waite
reigned
a
court
consisting
of
himself
and
i
call
attention
to
the
residences
of
these
--
of
the
justices
who
composed
the
court
at
that
time
because
that
wasn't
just
a
decade
after
the
end
of
the
war
between
states
and
they
were
men
from
states,
not
in
the
south,
not
in
mississippi
or
georgia
or
alabama
and
men
who
presumably
knew
what
the
congress
of
the
united
stated
did
in
1868
when
it
submitted
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
states.
there
were
associate
justices,
clifford
of
maine,
hunt
of
of
new
york,
strong
of
pennsylvania,
bradley
of
new
jersey,
swayne
of
ohio,
davis
of
illinois,
miller
of
iowa,
and
field
of
california.
the
only
one
of
the
justices
who
dissented
was
justice
clifford
and
strange
to
say
that
justice
clifford
was
the
only
one
of
the
nine
who
had
not
been
appointed
by
either
president
grant
or
president
lincoln.
this
is
important
i
think
i'm
not
just
as
gossip
at
all
because
it
illustrates
contemporaneous
construction
of
an
amendment
proposed
to
the
states
by
a
defendant
and
the
construction
given
by
the
men
of
judges,
justices
and
the
chief
justice
of
various
diversified
locations
and
here's
what
they
wrote.
“the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
a
state
from
denying
to
any
person
within
his
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
but
this
provision
does
not
add
anything
to
the
rights
which
one
citizen
has
under
the
constitution
against
another.
the
equality
of
the
rights
of
citizens
is
a
principle
of
republicanism.
every
republican
government
is
in
duty
bound
to
protect
all
its
citizens
in
the
enjoyment
of
this
principle
if
within
its
power.
that
duty
was
originally
assumed
by
the
states
and
it
still
remains
there.
the
only
obligation
resting
upon
the
united
states
is
to
see
that
the
states
do
not
deny
that
right.
this
the
amendment
guarantees
but
no
more.
the
power
of
the
national
government
is
limited
through
the
enforcement
of
this
guarantee.”
and
yet
it
is
suggested
in
the
briefs
and
it
is
suggested
in
oral
argument
before
the
court
that
the
--
this
section
of
the
amendment
which
provides
for
appropriate
legislation
may
go
beyond
that
vague
sentence.
it
speaks
of
the
first
part
of
it
being
self
executed
but
what
it
is,
is
what
it
is
and
it
is
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
congress,
under
the
--
without
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
course
no
legislation
of
this
sort
could
have
been
passed.
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
federal
government
sacred
powers,
but
that
power
of
the
national
government
is
limited
to
enforcement
of
that
guarantee.
what
guarantee?
the
obligation
resting
upon
the
united
states
to
see
that
the
states
do
not
deny
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction.
now,
there
was
a
birth
of
the
doctrine
of
state
action.
four
years
later
it
was
reiterated
in
the
virginia
versus
rives,
100
u.
s.
page
313.
i
call
your
attention,
if
you
please,
to
the
language
of
the
court
at
page
318
of
the
rives
case.
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
we
have
quoted
all
have
reference
to
state
action
exclusively
and
not
to
any
action
of
private
individuals,
any
action
of
private
individuals.
and
in
the
rives
case
decided
practically,
contemporaneously
with
the
cruikshank
case
92
u.
s.
at
page
214
in
1875,
the
third
and
fourth
sections
of
the
act
of
may
31,
1870
which
i
think
of
the
--
is
the
source
of
law,
this
section
here,
it
was
the
sixth
section
i
believe,
not
being
confined
in
their
operation
to
unlawful
discrimination
on
the
count
of
race,
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude,
are
beyond
the
limits
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
unauthorized.
now,
that
is
important
although
it
deals
with
the
fifteenth
amendment,
because
the
fifteenth
amendment
contains
the
very
same
appropriate
legislation
clause.
of
course,
i
recall
as
i'm
sure
your
honors
do
that
united
states
versus
rives
was
applied
by
judge
hoyt
davis
in
the
rives
case
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia
some
years
ago
and
this
court
reversed
the
rives
case
which
i
believe
appears
in
362
u.
s.,
but
distinguished
the
rives
case.
it
didn't
add
pieces
at
all,
it's
still
the
law
of
the
land,
that
down
through
the
four
score
and
ten
years
which
haven't
left
since
1875,
there
have
been
many
congresses,
many
justices
of
this
court
to
come
and
go,
many
attorneys
general,
many
solicitors
general,
many
constitutional
amendments,
but
the
principle
remains
primarily
embedded
in
our
constitutional
law
that
the
action
inhibited
by
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
only
such
action
as
may
fairly
be
said
to
be
that
of
the
states.
that
amendment
erects
no
shield
against
merely
a
private
conduct
however
discriminatory
or
wrong.
so
wrote
chief
justice
vincent
in
1948
in
shelley
versus
kraemer
and
two
of
the

ten
years
later,
ten
years
after
shelley
versus
kraemer,
on
september
29,
1958
in
the
middle
rock
crisis
at
the
august
1958
special
term
of
this
court
in
cooper
versus
aaron,
358
u.
s.
page
1,
the
court
said,
“the
controlling
legal
principles
are
plain.
the
command
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
that
no
state
shall
deny
to
any
person
within
his
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
state
acts
by
its
legislative,
its
executive,
or
its
judicial
authorities,
it
can
act
in
no
other
way,”

cooper
versus
aaron,
quoting
from
ex
parte
virginia
decided
in
1879,
100
u.
s.
at
page
347.
i
recognize
of
course
that
the
concept
of
what
is
or
is
not
state
action
may
have
varied
since
1875.
take
for
example
lombard
versus
louisiana
or
peterson
versus
greenville,
373
u.
s.
244,
but
the
fundamental
principle
remains
firmly
embedded
and
as
late
as
1963
was
succinctly
stated
in
peterson
versus
greenville.
in
deciding
these
cases,
the
court
does
not
question
the
long
established
rule
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
reaches
only
state
action.
antecedent
to
that
the
government
says
in
its
brief,
page
23,
the
text
of
the
equal
protection
clause
read
in
conjunction
with
the
fifth
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
authorizes
legislation
reaching
private
conspiracy.
now
that
section
is
this,
quoted
exactly,
“the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislation
the
provisions
of
this
article.”
now
in
this
lengthy
discussion
of
that
thesis
the
government
at
page
29
of
its
brief
says,
'in
short,
the
equal
protection
clause
states
the
nature
of
the
right
guaranteed
protected
equality
and
defines
the
area
of
constitutional
concern
state
activities.
the
rest
it
would
seem
is
left
to
congress
empowered
by
section
5
of
the
amendment
to
enforce
the
guarantee
by
appropriate
legislation,
the
risk.
now,
i
ask
what
risk?
there
isn't
anything
left
invisible
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
only
to
state
action.
further
the
government
says
at
pages
50
and
51
after
alluding
to
the
old
harris
case,
i
have
refereed
to
the
old
harris
case
in
106
u.
s.
that's
contrasted
with
a
more
recent
one
of
the
same
name
to
which
illusion
is
made
in
the
brief.
but
in
the
old
harris
case
written
by
justice
woods
is
this.
“so
far
as
we
are
aware
there
are
no
more
recent
cases
in
this
court
that
bound
the
question,”
this
is
a
government
copy,
“to
be
sure
it
has
been
reiterated
that
the
action
inhibited
by
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
only
such
action
as
may
fairly
be
said
to
be
that
of
the
states,”
compare
shelly
versus
kraemer,
“but
such
statements
may
fairly
be
read
as
defining
only
the
self
executing
force
of
the
amendment
only
did
by
implementing
legislation.”
now
that
last
sentence
is
directly
conferred
to
the
express
holding
in
the
harris
case.
there
in
1882
in
holding
section
5519
of
the
ohio
statute
unconstitutional,
the
court
has
to
say
it
in
cruikshank,
and
in
virginia
versus
rives
said
this.
“this
authority
show
conclusively
that
the
legislation
under
consideration
finds
no
warrant
for
it's
enactment
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
language
of
the
amendment
does
not
leave
this
subject
in
doubt.
when
the
state
has
been
guilty
of
no
violation
to
this
provision,
when
it
has
not
made
or
enforced
any
law
abridging
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states,
when
no
one
of
it's
departments
has
deprived
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law,
or
denied
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
when
on
the
contrary
the
laws
of
the
state
as
enacted
by
the
legislative
and
construed
by
its
judicial
and
administered
by
its
executive
departments
recognized
and
protected
the
rights
of
all
persons.
the
amendment
imposes
no
duty
and
confers
no
power
upon
congress.
now
that
case
is
cited
by
his
honor,
mr.
justice
black
in
his
dissent
in
bell
versus
maryland
recently
wherein
the
dissent
said
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
main
opinion
that
contradicts
the
argument,
that's
opposed
to
the
argument
that
i
make
here
with
respect
to
it.
but
it
so
succinctly
stated,
“no
state
shall
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
nor
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
law.
this
section
of
the
amendment
unlike
other
sections
is
a
prohibition
against
certain
conduct
only
when
done
by
a
state,
state
action
as
it
is
come
to
be
known
and
erects
no
shield
against
merely
private
conduct
however
discriminatory
or
wrongful.
this
well
established
interpretation
of
section
1
of
the
amendment
which
all
the
parties
here
including
the
petitioners
under
solicitor
general
accept
means
that
this
section
of
the
amendment
does
not
in
itself
standing
alone
in
the
absence
of
some
cooperating
state
action
or
compulsion
forbid
property
holders
including
restaurant
owners
to
ban
people
from
entering
or
remaining
upon
their
premises.
even
if
the
owners
act
out
of
racial
prejudice,
but
the
prohibitions
to
the
amendment
extend
to
all
actions
of
the
state
denying
equal
protection
of
the
laws
whether
by
its
legislative,
executive
or
judicial
authorities.
the
amendment
thus
forbids
all
kinds
of
state
action,
by
all
state
agents
and
officers
that
discriminate
against
presence
on
the
account
of
their
race.
it
was
this
kind
of
state
action
that
was
held
invalid
in
the
city
of
greenland,
in
lombard,
in
griffin
versus
school
board,
and
in
robinson
versus
florida.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
your
honor,
it's
in
your
dissent
and
i
don't
know,
i've
got
370
u.
s.
326.
i
don't
know
whether
that
quotation
is
--
at
that
point
or
whether
the
case
begins
at
326.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
sir?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i
don't
recall,
but
let
me
see,
i
may
have
it
here.
it
was
cited
here
at
378
u.
s.
226.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
this
section
is
the
amendment
unlike
other
sections
is
the
way
i
read,
is
a
prohibition
against
certain
conduct
and
only
when
done
by
a
state
that
unlike
wrong
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
did
that
--
is
the
unlike
wrong
here?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
it
should
be
like
–
how
does
it
read?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
but
this
is
where
we
have
it.
in
this
section
of
the
amendment
unlike
other
sections
is
prohibition
against
certain
conduct
only
when
done
by
a
state.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i
understood
the
other
sections
to
refer
the
first
four
sections
of
the
amendment.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
like
i
mean,
section
5
the
appropriate
legislation
section.
section
5
is
the
appropriate
legislation
section,
isn't
it?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
it
turned
like
the
other
section
it
applies
only
to
the
state
action.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
as
i
read
it
--
what
you
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
sir?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
but
it
did
--
the
majority
held
there
i
think
that
there
was
state
action.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i
understood
the
--
that's
the
way
i
understood
the
--
this
act
mean
that
the
question
of
whether
the
congress
could
legislate
despite
the
line
of
cases
beginning
back
in
18
--
it
was
left
open.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
and
that's
what
i
want
there
because
i
was
trying
to
show
that
while
it
was
left
open,
leaving
all
of
that,
while
it
was
left
open
that
it
ought
to
be
closed
because
of
the
unbroken
line
of
authorities
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
sir?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
pardon
me,
it's
left
open
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
as
i
understood
it
--
it
was
(voice
overlap)
perhaps
was
the
government
to
got
this
idea
that
the
(laughter)
that
their
might
be
something
left
in
that
legible
besides
of
what
the
court
has
decided
from
1870
down
to
--
that's
what
i
was
driving
at.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
would
you
mind
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i
would
say
no.
the
congress
did
not
have
the
power
to
do
it
and
it
didn't
do
it.
i
had
the
suggestion
made
somewhere
before,
maybe
it
was
smaller
than
i
thought
about
that
a
little
bit,
i
would
say
no
mr.
justice
because
i
see
when
the
--
it's
only
the
source
of
power
to
do
that
would
be
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
i
know
of
except
the
voting
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
that
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
that
if
no
state
--
no
state
shall
deprive
any
person
within
it's
jurisdiction
of
equal
protections
of
the
law,
it
means
just
what
it
says
and
particularly
when
you
connect
it
up
with
the
decisions
that
say
that
the
state
can
act
only
through
it's
judicial,
legislative
or
executive
branch.
now,
what
congress
would
be
doing
then
it
seems
to
me
would
be
to
go
beyond
that
scope
of
the
delegation
of
power
that
putting
in
the
aiding
abetting
clause.
what
the
congress
would
be
doing
in
the
sections
–
in
the
situation
of
that
sort
would
be
saying
that
no
person
shall
aid
or
abet
the
state
or
prevent
the
state
from
exercising
its
duty
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
--
it
would
be
the
law
to
preventive
then
aiding
and
abetting
and
i
don't
think
it's
got
that
right.
that
is
under
the
present
constitution.
it
is
only
the
legislative
department,
the
executive
department,
or
the
judiciary
department
that
can
deprive
a
person
within
its
jurisdiction
of
the
equal
protection
of
law.
so
it
alluded
to
that
is
what
the
law
have
outlined
by
referring
to
the
cases
of
the
lombard
case
and
the
peterson
case
goes
up
to
that
law.
but
i
thought
that
they
went
a
little
beyond
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
provided
but
still
they
were
decided,
but
even
with
those
cases
there,
i
don't
think
that
law
would
be
justified.
i
think
that's
a
good
place
for
me
to
stop
and
leave
it
my
associate
[inaudible].
thank
you.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
of
the
court
to
the
facts
that
united
states
versus
wheeler
is
discussed.
i
put
at
pages
15
and
[inaudible]
and
its
all
clear
and
i
sought
--
and
i
say
my
brief,
i
sought
there
to
distinguished
crime
and
bear
it
in
mind
that
mr.
justice
douglas
is
thinking
the
edwards
case
--
the
edward's
case,
a
california
case
had
going
back
to
kraemer.
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
sir?
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
i
think
the
lower
of
court
have
not
denied
it
upon
wheeler
in
our
case.
yes,
it
could
be
--
actually
--
mr.
charles
j.
bloch
the
district
judge
below
apparently
relied
heavily
on
wheeler
is
shown
by
his
frequent
citations
of
it
in
his
opinion,
in
the
transcript
pointing
it
to
33.
that
the
wheeler
disting
--
distinctively
distinguishes
crandall
and
have
it
relate
to
edwards
either
revoke
--
