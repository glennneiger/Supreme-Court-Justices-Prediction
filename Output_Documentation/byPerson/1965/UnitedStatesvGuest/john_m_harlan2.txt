justice
john
m.
harlan
would
your
argument
encompass
mr.
stewart
--
yeah,
mr.
justice
stewart's
hypothetical
in
the
last
case?
could
the
congress
make
it
a
--
the
murdering
of
a
negro
a
crime
--
federal
crime.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
indictment
allege
as
part
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
obstruct
the
state
in
fulfilling
it's
obligations
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
insurance
(voice

rely
on
the
insurance
against
that
they
interfere
into
those
rights
not
against
private
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question
whether
it's
an
allegation
in
the
indictment
the
state
would
be
obstructing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
state's
under
an
obligation
to
do
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh
we're
talking
about
private
discrimination
now.
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
enact
such
a
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
the
opinion
as
i
remember
it,
because
i
joined
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
said,
i
think
the
opinion
as
i
remember
it
because
i
joined
it
specifically
left
open
the
question,
specifically
left
open
in
the
question
that
you're
raising
here
as
to
whether
the
congress
could
legislate
beyond
the
field
of
state
action
under
section
5.
i
think
i'm
correct
in
my
recollection.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
they
weren't
--
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
i
may
put
a
hypothetical
to
you
just
to
emphasizing
that
--
hypothetical
just
to
see
if
i
understand
your
theory.
supposing
the
congress
passed
a
new
statute.
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
to
congress
passed
the
new
section
241
so
we
don't
get
tangled
with
the
history
of
this
one
and
said
that
the
if
found
that
the
conditions
of
a
opposition
in
certain
states
to
the
enforcement
of
the
racial
decisions
were
so
great
that
the
states
were
not
being
--
the
states
were
being
prevented
for
fulfilling
their
obligation
to
enforce
their
duty
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
therefore
it
became
necessary
for
the
congress
to
implement
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
reach
private
action
of
individuals
to
make
that
an
indictable
offense.
under
your
theory
would
congress
have
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
in
your
brief?
