justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
as
i
understood
the
question
of
the
vagueness
in
screws
[inaudible]
charged,
violated
due
process
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
called
it
in
--
due
process
of
law
had
been
defined
in
very
vague
terms
that
a
man
could
not
know
whether
a
thing
he
was
charged
with
[inaudible]
would
violate
the
fundamental
concepts
of
justice,
the
principles
of
dc.
for
that
reason,
the
court
held
that
so
far
as
due
process
is
concerned
it
added
vagueness
to
it
which
requires
a
man
to
know
that
you
had
to
add
something
to
show
that
the
man
knew
that
he
wouldn't
be
violating
the
federal
law.
i
understand
from
what
you're
saying
here
on
these
others,
that
you're
saying
it
in
specific
rights
that
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
or
ambiguity,
federal
rights
have
have
been
denied,
that
had
been
formed,
organization
of
conspiracy
to
deny
both
rights,
specific
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
require
you
would
it
not
to
go
to
the
rest
of
your
case
on
section
5,
the
right
of
the
congress
without
such
law
that
it
deemed
appropriate
to
prevent
discrimination
against
people
on
the
count
of
felony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
what
you're
saying
about
four.
four
it
seems
to
me
could
rest
over
the
charge,
it
seems
to
rest
on
the
charge
in
filing
them
or
the
right
to
use
the
streets,
highway
facilities
which
the
interstate
commerce
protects.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
would
the
fourteenth
amendment
be
as
what
you
said?
there
are
many,
many
laws
that
a
part
of
individuals
is
necessary
to
protect
the
interstate
commerce
beginning
with
[inaudible]
case,
or
the
white
slave
case,
stolen
automobile
case,
why
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
to
be
invoked
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
1
and
2,
are
those
rights
protected
by
any
--
by
the
reason
of
civil
rights
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
so
far
as
that's
concerned
then
if
they
are
protected
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
only
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
is
that
you
concern
then,
what
you
would
be
saying
is
they
have
conspired
to
deprive
them
a
right
guaranteed
by
that
section.
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
there,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
been
so
far
as
the
power
of
congress
debates
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
equal
protection,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
there
is
that
they've
deprived
them
of
the
right
which
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
against
in
the
operation
and
the
application
of
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
to
be
discriminated
against
on
account
of
their
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
--
now
wait
a
minute,
is
that
correct?
i
thought
the
vagueness
came
from
the
use
of
the
due
process
clause
not
the
use
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
of
it
was
mentioned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
mentioned
as
being
vague?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
couldn't
know
just
what
would
be
encompassed
in
the
word
due
process
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
have
been
given
such
a
broad
definition
if
there's
too
vague
to
arrest
him
and
prosecution
for
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
due
process
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
you're
reading
from
mr.
bloch
in
bell
versus
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
footnote
cited
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
footnote
cited
to
that,
you
recall?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
read
the
sentence,
did
you
not,
that
section
of
the
amendment
called
upon
like
other
sections
is
a
prohibition
against
certain
conduct
only
when
done
by
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
a
footnote
that
i
thought
there
was
and
i
just
found
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unlike
other
sections
and
the
quote
section
5
in
note
11,
the
congress
shall
have
power
to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislation
the
provisions
of
this
article.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
it's
unlikely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
congress
--
or
unlike
other
sections
and
then
the
note
says
section
5,
it
says
if
the
first
section
of
the
amendment
applies
only
to
states
and
state
action
unlike
other
sections
and
that
in
the
footnote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
and
--
on
the
other
section
--
it
was
in
the
other
section
referred
to
with
section
5
or
whatever
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
--
the
note
says
that
section
5
--
section
5
is
the
one
that
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
what
i
was
pointing
out
was
for
whatever
maybe
it
worth,
what
you
read
did
not
say
as
i
read
it
that
section
5
applied
only
to
the
state,
state
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
section
5
defines
state
action
just
as
my
brother
harlan
said
left
open
