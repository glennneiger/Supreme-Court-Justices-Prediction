mr.
james
e.
hudson
if
the
court
pleases,
one
part
here
that
i
think
should
be
brought
out
relative
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
right
that
mr.
bloch,
i
thought
did
not
cover
and
that
is
the
holding
in
the
williams
case
that
the
government
seem
to
be
relying
on
so
heavily.
we
take
the
position
that
even
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
williams
case
does
not
put
us
in
the
category
of
such
conspirator
because
the
dissenting
opinion,
it
appears
to
me
was
based
upon
the
facts
of
the
case
and
that
is
the
dissent
in
the
williams
case
construed
the
facts
to
be
that
there
was
state
action
in
the
williams
case,
that
is
the
--
williams
had
taken
an
oath
that
he
was
a
private
investigator.
he
had
taken
an
oath
as
a
special
policeman
of
florida
city
and
policeman
had
been
delegated
to
attend
the
investigation
out
of
which
this
conspiracy
indictment
arose.
and
we
think
even
under
the
dissent
in
the
williams
case
that
this
would
not
make
us
the
indictment
good
at
us,
because
in
our
indictment
there
is
no
mention
and
the
solicitor
general
has
admitted
in
his
argument
there
is
no
vestige
of
state
action.
we
are
purely
private
individual
so
even
under
the
williams
cases
we
--
this
indictment
is
not
good
as
to
us.
the
--
it
set
forth
that
the
government
makes
in
it's
the
argument
here
is
that
the
--
it
is
whether
or
not
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
acts
of
1964
amounts
to
a
conspiracy
on
the
18.241.
in
looking
through
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
acts
of
1964,
we
hold
the
opinion
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
congress
who
realized
that
we
had
a
very
serious
problem
especially
in
the
south
to
pass
the
law
that
everybody
could
live
with
and
stay
phased
with
and
comply
with
the
law.
and
that
is
borne
out
very,
very
clearly
by
statement
by
senator
humphrey,
and
of
course
now
the
vice
president
in
which
he
states
that
section
207
(b)
of
the
civil
rights
act
which
provides
that
the
remedies
provided
by
this
act
shall
be
the
exclusive
means
of
enforcing
the
act
is
necessary
otherwise,
the
persons
would
contend
that
a
violation
of
this
act
could
result
in
prosecution
on
the
18.241
and
242,
he
used
the
exact
statement.
so
it's
quite
obvious
from
the
legislative
history
that
it
was
not
intended
that
the
violation
of
the
civil
rights
acts
of
1964
be
a
violation
under
18.241.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
yes
sir.
that
is
in
my
brief
and
also
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
section
207
(b)
provides,
it
said
this
shall
be
the
exclusive
means
of
enforcing
the
remedies
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
word
exclusive
that's
used
in
that
context
is
not
susceptible
to
any
other
meaning.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
well,
and
that
--
mr.
james
e.
hudson
no
sir.
i
don't
mean
that.
if
that
were
the
case
and
i
content
that
it
is
not
--
but
if
that
were
the
case
then
the
indictment
would
have
to
be
based
upon
the
fourteenth
--
the
rights
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that
event
and
we've
argued
that
point
previously.
the
other
ppoint
in
this
case
that
the
government
has
been
raised
which
is
colloquy
particular
trouble
is
whether
or
not
a
conspiracy
to
violate
a
persons
right
to
ingress
and
egress
from
a
state
or
to
use
the
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
would
be
such
a
conspiracy
as
being
indictable
on
the
18.241.
we
don't
think
it
would
be
for
these
reasons.
first
or
all
the
rank
to
ingress
and
egress
to
and
from
a
state
is
not
mentioned
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
right
seems
to
have
been
under
the
ruling
in
wheeler
versus
united
states
which
is
a
1920
case.
it
seems
to
have
been
reserved
to
the
states.
in
the
wheeler
case
which
was
only
to
understand
and
in
1920
that
it
never
has
been
overruled.
in
the
wheeler
case
it
was
held
that
the
right
to
travel
to
and
from
a
state
was
not
the
answer
to
federal
citizenship.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
sir?
travel
to
and
from
washington?
now
that
might
bear
something
i
haven't
thought
about,
everybody
in
washington
be
in
federal
citizen
and
not
a
state
citizen
that
could
possibly
make
a
[inaudible]
but
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
think
the
district
of
columbia
as
far
as
the
political
--
mr.
james
e.
hudson
no
sir.
i
don't
think
this
--
the
state
in
versus
the
united
states
is
in
conflict
with
crandall.
now,
and
the
reason
i
see
it
--
mr.
james
e.
hudson
well,
in
the
crandall
versus
united
states,
the
state
of
nevada
had
passed
a
tax
which
the
taxed
of
certain
items
in
the
interstate
commerce
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
e.
hudson
and
as
i
get
to
the
ruling
in
the
crandall
case
the
basis
of
it
was
that
the
united
state
have
the
right
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
and
the
state
could
be
infringed
upon
it.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
no
sir,
i
don't
recall
that.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
i
don't
really
recall.
i
know
it
involved
the
tax
on
the
interstate
which
it
was
a
--i
guess
on
interstate
commerce.
but
if
your
honor,
if
the
court
please
i'm
coming
to
this
point,
even
admitting
this
not
admitting
but
for
purpose
of
argument
say
that
the
right
to
travel
to
and
from
the
state
is
an
answer
that
federal
citizenship.
if
it
is,
we
say
that
even
in
that
event
that
this
indictment
as
against
us
would
be
board
because
of
vagueness.
now,
my
personal
opinion
is
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
pass
the
law
and
not
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
under
its
right
to
regulate
commerce
and
say
if
you
kill
a
man
to
prevent
his
ingress
or
egress
in
--
from
a
state
or
prevent
him
from
using
the
instrument
instead
of
this
of
the
interstate
commerce
then
that
law
would
be
valid.
i
would
agree
to
that.
however,
the
congress
has
not
seen
it
fit
to
pass
such
a
law.
now
it
may
very
well
be
that
i
know
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
getting
killed
uselessly
and
something
should
be
done
about
the
people
riding
around
at
night
and
killing
innocent
people.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
yes
sir,
because
had
i
looked
at
the
statute
today
before
i
killed
the
man,
i
wouldn't
have
known
whether
or
not
i
was
committing
the
crime
though
it's
--
mr.
james
e.
hudson
not
under
the
previous
decisions
of
the
court
i
don't
think
so,
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
if
all
of
these
decisions,
wheeler
versus
the
us,
cruikshank
and
all
of
those
salughterhouse
cases
and
all
of
those
things,
if
those
things
had
all
held
that
a
conspiracy
to
violate
some
of
these
rights
were
the
conspiracy
on
the
18.241
then
when
i
do
that
i've
got
all
of
these
decisions
behind
me
in
that
rule
as
i'm
not
taking
this
rules
cases,
it
has
been
set
aside
and
that
is
--
that's
the
rule
of
--
that's
the
right
has
been
made
definite
by
decisions
of
the
law.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
oh,
i
understand
and
in
that
event
it
would
not
be
void
for
vagueness
but
we
don't
have
that
situation
here
--
mr.
james
e.
hudson
because
in
crandall
against
nevada,
nobody
remotely
suggested
that
they
put
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
nevada,
even
the
tax
collector
is
in
jail.
it
was
just
a
regulatory
posture.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
well,
but
it
didn't
overrule
this
other
cases.
it
didn't
overrule
wheeler
versus
nevada,
so
as
--
mr.
james
e.
hudson
i
mean
wheeler
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
no
sir.
or
else
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
it
leaves
me
in
the
same
position
as
the
court
as
i
would
have
been
held
that
in
argument,
the
screws
case
i
believe
if
your
honor
please,
all
of
these
decisions
have
consistently
held
that
these
type
rights
as
are
alleged
to
be
rights
under
the
indictment
were
not
rights
which
were
indictable
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
well
sir,
as
i
says
that
that
--
to
me
is
a
different
proposition
as
regulating
something
and
trying
to
put
somebody
in
jail.
it's
a
different
proposition
all
together
to
me.
i
would
take
the
position
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
e.
hudson
--
in
crandall.
mr.
james
e.
hudson
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
just
don't
understand
the
crandall
that
way.
now,
i
would
be
quite
frank
with
you.
that
maybe
exactly
what
it
holds,
but
i
didn't
mean
to
understand
it
that
way
and
i'm
not
--
that's
my
point,
the
main
--
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court
here
is
that
--
that
whether
this
mean
really
about
this
case
in
the
implications
of
the
crime
because
for
this
reason
this
court
among
--
has
been
a
broad
walk
here
for
individual
liberties
and
keeping
this
out
of
--
keeping
this
from
having
a
great,
strong,
central
police
force.
and
was
this
--
if
the
court
rules
against
us
on
this
interstate
commerce
and
the
implications
of
it
is
forwarded
onto
the
center
will
not
be
good
for
the
country
for
the
simple
reason
that
it's
hardly
anything
that
you
or
anybody
else
can
do
and
not
being
an
interstate
commerce.
and
so
as
the
court,
does
hold
in
this
case
that
this
estimates
of
interstate
commerce
are
indictable
along
to
18.214
then
there's
hardly
any
crime
that
should
ever
be
committed
that
would
not
be
or
could
not
be
construed
to
be
a
federal
crime.
and
i
don't
believe
that
it's
god
for
the
country
and
i
asked
you
to
stay
in
the
--
dismiss,
thank
you.
