justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
hudson
what
if
some
of
the
rights
were
secured
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
were
already
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
before
the
act
was
passed.
let's
just
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
and
then
the
1964
act
comes
along
and
says
what
it
does
and
says
exclusive.
so
something
that
would
have
been
protectable
by
criminal
prosecution
before
suddenly
becomes
not
protectable,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
fact
travel
to
and
from
washington?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
we
can
overrule
crandall
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
crandall
right
that
was
said
to
be
an
incidence
of
national
citizenship?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
does,
i
know
it
does
â€“.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
court
said
it's
expressly
--
it
was
putting
it
on
the
commerce
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
241
says
that
it
makes
the
crime
to
apprehend
some
private
person
to
prevent
him
--
to
i
think
decide
that
he
needed
his
right,
any
right
of
privilege
secured
to
him
by
the
constitution.
let's
assume
that
law
has
passed
one
day
and
just
the
day
before
the
--
it's
been
held
in
the
court
and
the
final
judgment
that
one
of
the
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
is
the
right
to
pass
to
and
from
the
state,
it
would
have
passed
along
the
roads
coming
back
and
forth
to
washington.
is
that
a
vague
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
--
well,
he
may
not
know,
but
you
knew
you
--
you
then
say
that
the
court
may
not
put
an
acceptable
gloss,
a
narrowing
gloss
on
a
vague
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
statute
is
vague,
it's
vague
on
its
face,
there's
no
narrow
construction
of
this
court
for
example
to
put
on
the
statute
which
thereafter
would
cure
other
vagueness?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
then
suggest
to
you
that
241
which
refers
to
a
right
of
privilege
under
the
constitution,
the
congress
passed
such
a
criminal
statute,
[inaudible]
the
right
or
privilege,
the
next
day
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
say
decided
that
one
of
the
rights
and
privileges
under
the
constitution
is
this
ingress
and
egress
that
--
and
then
someone
interferes
with
the
ingress
and
then
egress
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
then
18.241
with
the
extent
that
you
say
its
vague
cured
by
crandall
against
nevada.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
said
it
was
the
right
or
privilege
of
(inaudible)
and
that's
what
241
referred
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you
that
[inaudible]
on
that
is
a
criminal
statute,
you
don't
put
people
in
jail.
but
the
absence
of
credit
for
the
criminal
statute
doesn't
determine
or
[inaudible]
whether
or
not
there's
a
right
of
privilege
secured
for
the
constitution
and
crandall
said
there
was
that
--
now,
the
statute
--
the
criminal
statute
comes
along
and
says
that
you
don't
interfere
with
people's
right
with
the
constitution
and
one
of
those
rights
seems
to
make
you
move
back
to
its
place
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
lower
court
relied
upon
wheeler
didn't
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
lower
court
here
relied
upon
wheeler?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
do
you?
