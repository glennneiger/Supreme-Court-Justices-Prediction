that's
saying
the
essential
questions,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
--
that's
not
a
patentable
departure
from
the
prior
art,
it's
not
patentable
to
something
that
is,
is?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
that
might
be
the
other
one
end
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
no
disclosure
--
that
is
no
public
disclosure
of
the
wallace
patent,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
secret?
justice
potter
stewart
cases
are
all
against
you
on
102
(a),
a
good
reason
you
don't
rely
on
it
much?[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
questions
are
entirely
dissimilar
are
they
not?
the
way
you
present
the
case,
you
rely
exclusively
and
told
the
chief
justice
on
102
(e)
and
by
hypothesis
that
my
expression
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
it
refers
to
102
(e)?
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
still
don't
understand,
i
don't
understand
what
answer
you
gave
to
this
question.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
doolittle
disagrees
with
you
i
think.
he
says
that
wallace
would
have
to
get
a
license
from
regis?
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
misunderstand
his
contention
do
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
i
misunderstood
mr.
doolittle's
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
i
misunderstood
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
