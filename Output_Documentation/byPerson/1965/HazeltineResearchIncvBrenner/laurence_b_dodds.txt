mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
fortunately,
the
factual
situation
presented
by
this
case
is
somewhat
less
complex
than
the
one
heard
at
the
conclusion
of
the
session
yesterday.
it
can
be
very
simply
stated
and
this
factual
situation
raises
a
single
issue
of
law.
as
to
the
facts
an
inventor
by
the
name
of
robert
regis
made
an
invention
on
a
microwave
switch
and
filed
an
application
in
the
patent
office
in
1957.
briefly,
microwave
switch
is
a
device
which
is
useful
in
connecting
and
disconnecting
a
microwave
transmitter
station
from
it's
antenna
as
principally
used
for
example
in
radar
installations.
however,
fortunately
since
the
subject
matter
is
quite
complex,
the
issues
involved
do
not
require
going
into
the
details
of
that
device.
now,
after
that
application
was
filed
in
1957
and
certain
preliminary
proceedings
in
the
patent
office
which
are
not
material
here,
in
1959
the
examiner
of
the
patent
office
finally
rejected
the
claims
of
regis
saying
and
“as
being
unpatentable
over
wallace
in
view
of
carlson”
and
that
is
the
wallace
patent
2822526
and
carlson
patent
2491644
reproduced
in
the
record.
those
--
that
decision
of
the
primary
examiner
was
affirmed
by
the
patent
office
board
of
appeals
and
by
the
courts
below.
now,
the
respondent
neither
in
the
patent
office
nor
in
the
courts
below
contended
that
either
of
these
two
reference
patents,
the
wallace
patent
or
the
carlson
patent
individually
was
in
anticipation
of
the
regis
invention,
but
what
it
contended
was
that
if
one
were
to
combine
the
invention
of
wallace
with
the
invention
of
carlson
then
as
imagine
--
as
an
engineering
matter
that
combination
would
have
been
obvious
and
would
have
resulted
in
the
structure
defined
by
the
claims
in
regis
application.
that
would
be
alright
but
for
this
fact.
at
the
time
that
regis
filed
it's
patent
application
in
1957,
the
wallace
disclosure
was
found
solely
in
an
application
which
was
maintained
in
secrecy
in
the
patent
office
and
was
not
available
to
regis
nor
to
any
other
workers
in
the
art
who
at
that
time
might
have
been
attempting
to
devise
the
regis
microwave
switch.
the
wallace
application
and
the
resulting
patent
is
what
has
been
come
to
be
known
in
the
jargon
of
the
patent
law
as
a
co-pending
patent,
that
is
a
patent
which
was
filed
before
the
patent
on
controversy
but
did
not
issue
until
later.
so
that
there
was
a
period
in
which
both
the
so
called
reference
patent
and
the
application
or
patent
under
consideration
were
both
pending
in
the
patent
office
and
both
maintain
in
secrecy.
now,
the
respondent
in
this
case
relies
solely
on
section
103
of
title
xxxv
united
stated
code,
the
1952
patent
act
and
they
will
have
a
little
more
to
say
about
that
later,
and
the
respondent
contends
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
wallace
patent
was
at
the
time
a
secret
application
in
the
patent
office
that
it
was
and
a
“prior
art”
as
that
term
is
used
in
section
103.
and
therefore,
the
invention
or
the
disclosure
of
wallace
could
be
combined
with,
taken
together
with
that
in
earlier
patents
which
were
admittedly
prior
art
to
show
that
what
regis
did
was
an
obvious
thing
to
do
under
section
103
of
the
statute.
now
as
is
petitioner's
position
however,
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
wallace
patent,
as
of
it's
filing
date,
was
not
a
part
of
the
prior
art
as
that
term
is
used
in
section103
of
the
statute
and
was
not
competent
evidence
to
show
whether
or
not
what
regis
did
would
have
been
obvious
to
that
mythical
man
skilled
in
the
art
at
the
time
that
regis
made
his
invention.
therefore,
the
sole
issue
of
law
presented
on
this
petition
is
whether
such
a
co-pending
patent
which
is
maintained
in
secrecy
in
the
patent
office
until
it
issues
is
a
part
of
that
general
fund
of
knowledge
come
to
be
known
as
the
prior
art
as
that
term
is
used
in
section
103
of
the
statute.
now,
this
section
103
is
the
only
section
of
the
patent
statutes
which
define
for
the
term
and
conditions
for
patentability
which
uses
this
term
prior
art.
and
it
reads
in
part,
“if
the
differences
between
the
subject
matter
sought
to
be
patented
and
the
prior
art
are
such
that
the
subject
matter
as
a
whole
would
have
been
obvious
at
the
time
the
invention
was
made,
at
the
time
the
invention
was
made
to
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.”
now,
at
the
time
the
invention
made
as
far
as
we're
discussing
here
was
at
the
time
that
regis
filed
his
patent
application.
it
had
not
been
--
there
has
been
no
occasion
for
attempting
to
establish
an
earlier
date
of
invention.
now,
the
statutes
nowhere
explicitly
define
this
term
prior
art,
but
there
were
many
decisions
of
the
courts,
the
lower
and
the
superior
courts
going
back
a
100
years
which
did
define
the
term
prior
art
and
in
this
case
there
is
also,
we
have
some
assistance
from
the
report
of
the
committee
of
the
judiciary
in
reporting
out
the
1952
patent
act.
that
report
and
referred
to
that
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
says
that
section
103
was
the
first
statutory
statement
of
this
particular
condition
for
patentability
which
is
sometimes
been
referred
to
as
defining
what
is
invention,
an
illusive
term,
and
that
report
said
section
103
states
this
requirement
of
patentability
in
the
title.
it
refers
to
the
difference
between
the
subject
matter
sought
to
be
patented
and
the
prior
art
meaning
what
was
known
before
as
described
in
section
102.
now,
here
we
have
a
definition
of
prior
art.
it
is,
meaning
what
was
known
before
as
described
in
section
102.
but
now,
it
appears
that
section
102
was
described
--
which
defines
most
of
the
conditions
for
patentability
has
seven
subsections,
but
of
those
only
the
first
ones
subsection
a
refers
--
uses
this
language
what
was
known
before.
and
the
committee
report
in
discussing
this
section
102
(a)
again
gives
a
definition
of
“what
was
known
before,”
and
i
quote
again
briefly.
section
102
in
paragraphs
a,
b,
and
c
repeats
the
conditions
in
the
existing
law
relating
to
novelty.
subsection
a,
and
that's
the
one
we're
concerned
with,
is
the
language
of
the
existing
law
recognizing
that
the
interpretation
by
the
courts
excludes
various
kinds
of
private
knowledge
not
known
to
the
pubic.
and
continuing,
the
interpretation
by
the
courts
of
paragraph
a,
and
that's
the
section
102
(a),
as
being
more
restricted
than
the
actual
language
would
suggest,
(for
example
known
has
been
held
to
mean
publicly
known)
is
recognized.
so
summarizing
this
chain,
we
find
that
in
determining
what
prior
art
means
under
section
103,
it
says
what
was
means,
what
was
known
before
as
defined
in
section
102
and
we
turn
to
102
(a)
and
it
says
what
was
known
before
means
what
was
publicly
known
before.
so
that
in
this
instance
the
wallace
patent
that
we're
talking
about
which
was,
at
the
time
the
regis
application
was
filed,
a
secret
application
in
the
patent
office,
was
certainly
not
“prior
public
knowledge”
and
we
submit
that
it
was
not
prior
art
available
under
section
103
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
respondent
places
sole
reliance
on
this
petition.
in
addition
to
the
committee
report
to
which
i
have
referred
there
have
been
many
decisions
over
the
years,
many
of
the
leading
decisions,
involving
what
the
committee
referred
to
as
the
interpretation
by
the
courts
to
the
effect
that
prior
knowledge,
and
that's
used
in
section
102,
is
limited
to
prior
public
knowledge.
those
authorities
are
set
forth
and
analyzed
in
the
brief
and
i
won't
repeat
them
at
this
time.
now,
going
back
again,
the
patent
office
said
that
regis
could
not
have
this
patent
because
the
invention
was
unpatentable
over
wallace
in
view
of
carlson.
now
that
is
what
to
be
known
in
the
patent
regarded
again
as
a
combination
rejection.
the
disclosures
of
two
or
more
patents
or
publications
are
considered
together
and
combined
together
to
build
up
a
structure,
which
is
shown
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
structure,
which
is
being
claimed.
and
whenever
a
rejection
of
that
sort
is
being
made
it
is
by
the
authority
of
section
103
referring
to
one
of
the
conditions
of
patentability
that
the
invention
shall
not
have
been
obvious
over
the
prior
art.
but,
and
i
repeat
at
the
time
that
regis
made
his
invention,
the
wallace
patent
was
not
a
part
of
the
prior
public
knowledge
and
it
was
not
a
prior
part
of
the
prior
art
and
it
could
not
be
used
to
show
in
conjunction
with
another
invention,
the
invention
of
carlson
to
show
whether
or
not
what
regis
did
was
amounted
--
or
did
amount
to
invention.
we
also
submit
your
honors
that
the
better
reasoned
decision
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
yes
sir.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
your
honor,
i
definitely
do
not
and
as
a
matte
of
fact
in
my
brief
i
referred
to
a
decision,
a
recent
decision
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
which
said
expressly
that
section
102
(e)
had
nothing
--
i'm
sorry
that
was
one
102
(b),
it
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
103.
well,
it's
our
position
that
102
(e)
likewise
has
nothing
to
do
with
103.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
well,
that
would
be
true
your
honor.
if
the
wallace
patent
or
an
--
or
something
insignificant
variations
of
the
wallace
patent
showed
the
regis
invention,
if
that
were
so,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
recognize
that.
there's
no
question
that
the
wallace
patent
is
a
reference
under,
if
it
can
be
used,
under
102
(e)
to
show
under
the
--
that
that
section
of
that
statute
uses
the
word
the
invention,
not
some
different
invention.
but
here
it
is
not
contended
that
the
wallace
patent
chose
the
invention
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
explicitly
holds
that
it
held
that
it
is
not.
at
page
70
(a)
of
the
record
the
district
court
in
it's
opinion
said
neither
the
wallace
et
al
patent
nor
the
carlson
patent
alone
anticipates
the
invention
described
in
the
claims
and
suit.
now,
that's
the
finding
effect
of
the
district
court,
which
i
believe
had
not
been
challenged
and
i
believe
it's
binding
on
the
appellate
tribunals.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
in
wallace.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
neither
wallace
or
carlson.
the
only
way
that
would
be
possible
to
attempt
to
reconstruct
regis
invention
was
to
add
those
two
inventions
together
and
on
that
it
has
to
become
under
section
103
your
honor.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
a
few
comments
on
the
respondent's
brief.
this
1952
patent
act
is
a
little
art
in
a
way.
the
section
102
has
seven
subsections
and
section
103
just
a
single
section,
but
they
all
expressed
negatively.
they
say
that
inventor
is
entitled
to
a
patent
unless
one
of
these,
what
they
term
conditions
for
patentability
is
satisfied.
now,
respondent
in
its
brief
cites
numerous
authorities
under
section
102
which
your
honor
referred
to
or
under
the
alexander
milburn
case
of
this
court
which
section
102
(e)
codified
showing
that
a
co-pending
patent
for
that
purpose
was
a
proper
reference
and
we
concede
that
that
is
a
fact.
but
they
then
from
that
specific
showing
attempt
to
generalize
and
say
“well,
the
co-pending
patent
is
relevant,
as
they
say
relevant
to
patentability
because
it
was
relevant
under
this
one
condition
of
patentability,”
but
it
then
attempted
to
extend
that
to
all
the
other
conditions
of
patentability,
some
of
which
are
very
clearly
inapplicable
because
this
doesn't
make
any
sense.
now
we
say
that
it's
a
complete
non
sequitor.
the
fact
that
because
the
wallace
patent
maybe
a
reference
under
section
102
(e)
that
it's
there
--
by
automatically
becomes
a
reference
and
therefore
as
they
say
relevant
to
patentability
under
all
the
other
sections
of
the
act.
and
that
the
courts
have
not
so
held
that
we
do
--
that
it
was
a
logical
too
and
there
within
the
meaning
or
the
theory
of
the
congress
to
passing
that
act.
there's
one
other
comment
which
i
would
like
to
make
with
respect
to
respondent's
brief
and
that
is
it
repeatedly,
what
we
believe
misstates
the
factual
situation
by
reiterating
the
assertion
that
the
regis
invention
is
but
an
insignificant
advance
over
the
wallace
patent.
now
we
have
just
referred
to
that.
if
that
were
true
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
section
102
in
the
prior
we
wouldn't
--
but
applying
we
wouldn't
be
here,
but
it
is
not
true.
in
our
brief
i
have
referred
to
some
of
these
repeated
statements
which
we
believe
are
misstatements.
for
example,
at
page
29
in
it's
brief
that
states
“now,
if
both
wallace
and
regis
patents
were
to
issue
for
example,
a
member
of
the
public
wishing
to
use
the
single
patentable
invention
of
regis
and
wallace
embodied
in
both
might
have
to
obtain
license
from
both
patentees
and
wallace
the
prior
inventor
might
have
to
obtain
a
license
from
regis,
but
that
is
such
not
the
fact,
but
that
assertion
or
its
equivalent
is
repeated.
so
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
the
court,
the
judgment
as
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
first
because
maybe
wallace
patent
or
–
nor
carlson
patent
shows
that
regis
was
not
the
first
inventor
under
section
102
(e).
and
secondly,
wallace
patent
is
not
a
part
of
the
prior
art
which
then
refers
that
general
fund
of
knowledge
available
to
those
go
in
the
art
to
determine
whether
the
quantum,
the
amount
of
advance
which
regis
made
over
that
prior
art
allotted
to
a
patentable
invention.
thank
you.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
your
honors,
i
would
have
a
few
minutes.
there's
one
point
i
should
like
to
take
up
initially
and
i
believe
there
has
been
a
bit
of
confusion
unwillingly
introduced.
as
i
understood
the
position
of
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
was
that
they're
relying
solely
on
section
103,
but
wanted
to
incorporate
into
that
certain
sections
102
but
i
say
section103
that
does
not
permit
that.
what
103
says
is
this,
“even
though
you
cannot
get
a
patent,
even
though
you
can
get
a
patent
under
102
still
if
the
differences
are
not
enough
to
amount
to
a
patentable
invention
that
it's
such
have
been
obvious
in
the
--
as
to
the
--
once
skilled
in
the
art
at
the
time
the
invention
was
made,
it's
an
additional
reason
why
you
can't
get
a
patent
but
nowhere
and
103
is
there
any
intent
to
incorporate
102
as
to
what
is
within
the
scope
of
prior
art.
the
introductive
phrase
says
you
would
first
go
to
102
only
in
the
case
that
even
though
the
102
is
not
a
bar
still
you
may
not
get
a
patent
if
it
was
obvious
over
the
prior
art.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
yes
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that's
exactly
our
position.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
prior
art
and
the
decisions
which
we
have
discussed
and
analyzed
in
our
brief
that
all
of
the
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
because
it's
precisely
right
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
and
in
this
case
of
wallace
it
said
precisely
that
prior
art
means
what
was
publicly
known,
it's
that
general
fund
of
technical
probably
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
unfortunately
there
weren't.
as
there
were
decisions
both
ways
[laughter]
--
there
were
decisions
both
ways.
those
are
considerable
conflicts
and
there
was
even
more
conflict
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
alexander
milburn
case
because
there
they
charged
before
that
some
of
the
decisions
tried,
they
would
draw
still
further
on
the
line
of
distinction.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
pardon?
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
i
think
detrola
has
no
bearing
on
the
case.
i
was
telling
you
that
and
the
reason
for
that
is.
as
i
referred
in
my
--
our
briefs,
if
you
look
at
the
record
and
the
briefs
and
the
detrola
case,
the
position
was
solely
that
the
invention
their
involved
was
shown
not
to
be
the
prior
invention
of
wheeler
but
it
was
shown
in
the
inventions
of
other
people.
now
it
is
true
that
the
words
prior
art
were
referred
to
and
we're
using
that
in
that
case,
but
in
the
portions
that
i
quoted
in
our
brief
it
was
pointed
that
they
will
not
be
using
them
in
the
same
sense
they
were
talking
about
here
nor
were
they
using
them
in
the
sense
that
section
103
uses
them.
they
were
using
them
as
a
general
phrase
in
lieu
of
sometimes
what's
called
synonymously
anticipation,
an
anticipation
embraces
all
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
we
think
the
patent
office
is
wrong
but
they
did
--
the
patent
office
even
before
the
1952
act.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
they
have
maintained
the
1952
act.
the
patent
office
still
maintains
the
co-pending
patent
as
far
as
the
prior
art
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
and
they
did
before
1952,
yes,
your
honor.
now
one
other
point,
as
i
understand
that
the
respondent
would
have
the
court
believe
that
the
addition
of
the
carlson
invention
to
wallace
was
an
insignificant
one.
we
think
that
is
not
right.
well,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
carlson
invention
itself
was
not
a
significant
invention
and
therefore
the
addition
of
carlson
invention
to
the
invention
of
wallace
cannot
under
any
sense
be
termed
an
insignificant
variation
over
wallace.
the
question
that
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief
there
are
cases
where
under
section
102
(e)
quite
properly
the
co-pending
patent
did
not
have
everything,
but
there
were
some
insignificant
variations,
i'll
use
the
response
positions
such
as
the
kind
of
a
cabinet
or
support
or
perhaps
the
use
of
gears
instead
of
pulleys
where
it
is
not
necessary
to
add
the
invention
of
somebody
else
to
build
up
an
anticipating
structure.
but
that
isn't
the
situation
we
have
here.
counsel
for
our
respondent
also
referred
to
the
question
of
fairness
which
we
introduced
in
our
brief
and
that's
the
question
is
it
less
fair
to
deny
an
inventor
a
patent
under
section
102
(e)
because
of
a
co-pending
of
it's
patent
of
which
he
could
not
have
knowledge
that
it
is
here
and
the
answer
is
very
clear.
in
the
situation
of
102
(e)
or
as
presented
by
alexander
milburn
case
if
the
patent
had
been
granted
to
the
later
inventor
even
though
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
co-pending
patent
he
would
then
have
this
in
a
position
to
take
a
way,
the
right
of
the
actual
prior
inventor
from
using
his
own
invention.
if
in
fact
a
patent
had
been
granted
to
this
second
applicant
of
which
even
though
he
had
no
knowledge,
so
it
has
become
a
question
of
fairness
as
between
the
first
inventor
and
the
second
inventor.
somebody
might
be
asked
to
be
heard,
it
seems
fairer
to
hurt
the
second
inventor
than
the
first
inventor,
but
that
isn't
true
here.
if
a
patent
is
granted
to
regis
nothing
is
going
to
prevent
wallace
of
he's
asking
this
from
using
his
invention
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
that
is
definitely
--
absolutely
no
authority
or
no
logic
for
that.
the
regis
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
no,
i
think
you
did
understand
that
position,
i
agree
with
you
but
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
but
we
hardly
disagree
with
it.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
the
point
is
the
claims
that
we're
talking
about
here
and
the
regis
which
are
before
this
court
for
decision.
if
ever
the
patent
office
--
everybody
says
they
are
not
a
wallace
invention,
they
say
that
--
the
district
court
said
explicitly
that
the
regis
invention
is
not
unpatentable
over
wallace
alone.
it's
for
a
different
invention
and
if
wallace
built
his
device
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
rulings
of
the
patent
office
in
regis
he
would
not
require
any
license
from
regis
nor
would
carlson
and
moreover
your
honors
when
the
wallace
patent
and
the
carlson
patent
expire,
the
public
is
then
free
to
use
the
inventions
disclosed
in
those
patents
without
any
charge
of
infringements
by
regis
so
the
claims
would
be
granted
to
regis.
there's
just
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
very
definitely,
yes
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
wallace
patent
and
the
carlson
patent
are
earlier
sometimes
what
we
called
dominating
factors
and
if
they
broadly
claim
what
they
had
and
if
regis
is
the
combination
of
those
two
inventions
regis
would
probably
have
to
have
a
license
under
both
wallace
and
carlson
in
order
to
practice
his
invention
and
that's
permanent.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
earlier
and
perhaps
others
and
that
is
the
general
principle
in
the
patent
law
that
later
improvement
patent
is
always
subject
to
any
earlier
broader
dominating
patents
which
may
form
a
part
of
the
invention
of
the
later
patent.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
it's
certainly
true
in
this.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
that
is
true
in
general
i
might
--
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
well,
frankly
your
honor
i
haven't
studied
the
claims
of
wallace
and
carlson
to
see
just
what
they
were
claiming.
as
you
are
normally
familiar
whether
or
not
you
can
require
a
license
or
be
charged
with
an
infringement
depends
upon
the
scope
of
the
claims.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
sometimes,
but
assuming
if
those
men
had
patent
claim
with
their
patent
--
with
their
invention.
mr.
laurence
b.
dodds
it
could
be,
but
if
wallace
and
carlson
properly
claimed
their
inventions
regis
would
require
licenses
from
the
owners
of
what
was
the
patent
in
order
to
practice
his
invention,
but
not
the
converse
as
the
counsel
for
respondent
urges.
thank
you,
your
honors.
