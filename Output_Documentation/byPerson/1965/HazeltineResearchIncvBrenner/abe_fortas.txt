mr.
doolittle,
i'm
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand
whether
your
statement
of
petitioner's
position
is
in
fact
the
petitioner's
position.
in
making
the
distinction
of
102
--
like
in
distinguishing
102
(e)
i
thought
it
was
petitioner's
position
that
the
article
here
would
be
patentable
if
you
consider
only
the
wallace
invention.
and
that
petitioner's
point
is
that
considering
wallace
in
view
of
carlson,
there's
no
invention
here
but
that
if
you
consider
wallace
alone
that
this
was
a
significant
advance
in
terms
of
the
patent
act.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
i'm
correct
about
this,
but
i
did
get
a
different
impression
of
the
petitioner's
position?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
that
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
an
area
--
is
there
an
area
in
which
a
perspective
user
of
this
invention
would
have
to
obtain
a
license
from
both
wallace
and
regis?
justice
abe
fortas
and
a
licensee,
a
person
wanting
to
use
the
invention
or
wanting
a
practice
in
the
field
of
the
art
would
in
some
area
have
to
obtain
a
license
from
the
two
of
them
or
perhaps
three?
