excuse
me,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
consider
subdivision
e
of
102
to
have
any
relevancy
to
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
the
face
of
it,
it
shall
be
entitled
with
the
patent
unless
the
invention
was
described
in
an
application
for
patent
by
another
filed
before
the
invention
thereof
by
the
applicant
for
patent.
on
the
face
of
it,
it
seems
that
it
fits
this
case
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
your
answer
is
that
it
does
not
fit
this
case
because
the
invention
involved
in
the
regis
patent
was
not
--

j.

in
wallace.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be
by
force
of
subdivision
(e).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
--
i'm
just
wondering
how
that
can
face
that
there
is
an
explicit
(e)
that
would
cover
that
situation
and
how
that's
fortunate
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
date
of
judge
hand's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
question
states
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
of
it
is
relying
primary
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
is
that
102
has
the
number
of
conditions
under
which
you
cannot
get
a
patent
issued.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
103
just
adds
still
another
one,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
