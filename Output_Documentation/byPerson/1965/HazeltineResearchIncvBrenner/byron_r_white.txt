justice
byron
r.
white
and
regis
wouldn't
infringe
either
wallace
or
carlson?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
need
to
make
this
point
about
102
(e)
or
why
does
102
(a)
get
to
as
far
as
you
need
to
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
why
it
should
be
when
it
says
the
invention
is
known
or
used
by
others.
it
doesn't
say
that
--
i
mean
if
i
know
something
i
don't
need
--
i
could
still
--
not
tell
anybody
else
and
if
i
can
use
something
i
don't
need
to
tell
anybody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
have
a
trade
secret
--
secret
process
and
they're
using
it
and
knowing
it,
nobody
else
knows
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
know
why
that
wouldn't
be
a
decent
part
of
the
prior
art
though,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
don't
--
but
you're
saying
that
the
reference
of
prior
art
in
103
includes
102
(e).
now,
i'm
just
wondering
why
you
needed
to
have
any
references
--
then
on
subsection
(a).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
invitation
was
known
--
it
was
certainly
was
known
by
the
people
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
doolittle?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
wallace
hadn't
filed
for
a
patent
at
all?
he
had
just
started
using
the
process,
but
it
was
a
secret
process
and
then
this
patentee
--
then
the
same
question
comes
up
whether
this
--
what's
this
fellow's
name
--
regis
files
for
a
patent.
and
if
the
patent
issued
and
then
finds
out
that
wallace
is
using
--
well,
he
sues
somebody
for
infringement
and
then
had
claimed
that
his
patent
was
invalid
because
wallace
was
using
a
process
which
would
make
his
patent
obvious.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
the
same
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
wondering
what
are
the
secret
processes,
the
trade
secrets
that
are
being
use
prior
to
this
--
or
part
of
the
prior
art
secret
processes
that
someone
is
using
as
part
of
the
prior
art.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
should
be
a
similar
question
shouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
have
an
opportunity
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
the
prior
art
means
when
congress
that
referred
the
prior
art
when
an
invention
has
to
be
none
obvious
over
the
prior
art,
what
was
the
reference
of
prior
art?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
congress
mean
by
those
words,
what
the
cases
said
it
meant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
there
were
any
decisions
prior
to
1952
that
said
a
co-pending
patent
was
part
of
the
prior
art?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
detrola
is
really
relative
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
detrola
really
has
any
bearing
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
the
regular
practice
of
the
patent
office
prior
to
1952
to
include
co-pending
patents
in
the
prior
art?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
is
wrong
in
saying
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
patent
office
doesn't
know
what
they
were
doing
in
1952?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
did
before
--
and
it
did
before
1952?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
that
true
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
that
true
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
regis
will
have
to
have
a
--
if
he
gets
the
patent
he
will
still
have
to
have
a
license
from
wallace.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
could
be
anyway
that
regis
doesn't
get
--
that
regis'
invention
is
obvious
and
non
patentable
or
well,
it
could
be
that
he
would
get
his
--
that
he
would
get
his
patent
because
his
invention
was
not
obvious
and
still
he
wouldn't
have
to
have
a
license
from
wallace.
