petitioner
versus

mr.
dodds.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
speak
a
little
louder
please,
mr.
doolittle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
courts
below
used
the
word
insignificant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
enough
disclosure
of
the
wallace
patent
to
make
the
advance
obvious
to
--
of
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
was
i
was
referring
to.
is
there
any
public
disclosure
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
bear
upon
the
obviousness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
just
once
more,
how
does
that
square
with
the
statement
of
the
examiner
that
you
just
mentioned
that
there
was
sufficient
disclosure
of
the
wallace
patent
when
taken
in
connection
with
the
carlson
patent
to
put
them
on
notice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
the
prior
art
did
in
fact
form
general
knowledge
in
the
knowledge
of
people
through
publications
or
to
the
patents
that
this
was
a
prior
art?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
means,
you
do
not
rely
on
the
other
side
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
regard
to
what
the
cases
might
hold
in
this
field
isn't
your
argument
--
doesn't
your
argument
give
us
all
that
they
started
to
viewed
to
the
meaning
of
obvious?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
it
be
obvious
to
a
man
if
he
had
no
way,
if
there
was
no
possible
way
that
he
could
find
out
what
the
art
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
to
anyone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
must
be
on
a
--
i
would
think
it
might
be
another
theory,
but
not
on
the
theory
that
it's
obvious.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dodds.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
