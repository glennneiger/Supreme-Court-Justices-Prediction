mr.
j.
william
doolittle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
one
of
several
cases
before
the
court
this
term
involving
the
broad
question
of
whether
or
not
the
lower
federal
courts
have
properly
limited
the
award
of
patent
monopoly
by
maintaining
adequate
standards
of
patentability.
this
case
differs
from
the
others
in
that
here
the
courts
below
properly,
we
submit,
resisted
the
applicant's
efforts
to
lower
the
standards
of
patentability
and
that's
to
enlarge
the
patent
monopoly.
precise
question
presented
here
is
whether
a
co-pending
patent
is
a
relevant
reference
in
determining
whether
an
applicant
has
made
a
patentable
advance
in
the
art
under
section
103
of
the
patent
act
of
1952
and
as
petitioner's
counsel
has
indicated
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
it
is
not
so
available.
so
that
a
patent
could
issue
on
an
application
notwithstanding
that
an
earlier
filed
co-pending
patent
had
disclosed
everything
in
that
application,
except
what
is
obvious
to
the
ones
field
in
the
art.
in
other
words,
petitioners
will
allow
a
patent
issue
on
an
application
disclosing
no
patentable
advance
over
a
prior
patent
and
of
course,
that
is
exactly
what
this
case
involves.
the
petitioners
having
conceded
that
the
advance
which
the
regis
application
made
over
the
co-pending
wallace
patent
was
an
unpatentable
obvious
one
in
view
of
the
carlson
invention.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
counsel
has
focused
specifically
on
the
government's
use
of
the
word
insignificant
in
referring
to
this
advance,
the
advance
that
the
regis
application
made
over
the
wallace
application.
perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
say
insignificant
for
purposes
of
the
patent
laws
because
the
fact
is
the
advance
was
an
unpatentable
advance
in
the
eyes
of
the
patent
laws
because
as
is
universally
conceded,
it
was
an
obvious
advance.
now
i
should
like
to
pause
for
a
moment.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
they
didn't
your
honor.
no,
they
didn't.
it's
as
i
say,
when
we
say
insignificant
we
mean
insignificant
in
view
of
the
patent
laws,
unpatentable,
an
advance
that
could
not
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
patent.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor
it
isn't
in
the
sense
that
an
obvious
advance
is
an
unpatentable
advance,
and
you
have
to
make
a
qualification
on
that
general
concept
in
order
to
come
out
the
way
petitioners
would
have
you
come
up.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
say
“well,
we're
going
to
make
an
exception.
we're
going
to
give
a
patent
for
an
unpatentable
advance
or
for
what
would
otherwise
be
an
unpatentable
advance
in
this
instance
because
as
i
say
it
is
an
advance
that
is
universally
considered
to
be
an
obvious
one
which
section
103
says
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
but
it
is
a
patentable
advance,
it
is
an
unpatentable
advance
over
a
prior
patent.
they're
going
to
be
two
--
if
a
patent
is
issued
there
are
going
to
be
two
patents
available,
one
of
which
is
going
to
be
an
obvious
one
in
light
of
the
other
one.
that
–
that
much
can't
be
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
it
is
the
something
else
that
makes
it
obvious,
but
you're
right
it
is
the
combination
of
the
two.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
are
going
to
be
two
patents
that
--
where
the
difference
is
obvious
between
the
two.
i
would
like
for
a
moment
just
to
try
to
place
petitioner's
position
in
each
proper
context.
now,
petitioners
recognize
that
a
so-pending
patent
is
available
to
show
a
disclosure
identical
to
the
disclosure
of
the
application
in
issue.
however,
petitioners
would
make
a
co-pending
patent
unavailable
where
its
disclosure
is
not
identical
to
that
of
the
application,
but
where
the
difference
in
disclosures
is
so
insubstantial
as
to
be
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
the
art.
second,
petitioners
recognize
that
all
other
references
that
are
available
to
show
identical
disclosures
are
also
available
to
show
obviousness
that
petitioners
would
single
out
this
one
kind
of
reference
co-pending
patents
for
special
treatment.
and
thirdly,
petitioners
recognize
that
if
the
co-pending
patent
here
had
issued
just
two
months
earlier
than
it
did,
that
is
after
three
years
and
eight
months
in
the
patent
office
rather
than
three
years
and
ten
months,
the
disclosure
of
the
regis
application
would
have
been
unpatentable.
their
contention
is
that
the
passage
of
these
two
months
rendered
that
application,
rendered
the
disclosure
and
that
application
patentable.
we
submit
that
this
position
was
contrary
to
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
patent
act
and
should
be
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
as
i
understand
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position
is
and
this
--
what
i'm
stating
is
not
only
the
petitioner's
position
but
the
government's
position
as
well,
that
the
wallace
application,
the
wallace
patent
did
not
fully
disclose
the
regis
disclosure,
and
therefore,
section
102
(e)
is
not
strictly
speaking
applicable.
we
do
not
contend
otherwise,
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
wallace
patent
by
itself,
i
strike
the
by
itself
but
that
the
wallace
patent
does
not
render
the
regis
application
unpatentable.
you
can't
take
it
out
of
the
context
of
the
fact
that
the
carlson
patent
was
already
on
the
books.
it
was
available
to
the
--
to
those
skilled
in
the
arts
and
knowing
what
they
know
because
of
the
existence
of
the
carlson
patent,
they
knew
that
the
--
it
would
be
obvious
to
go
from
the
wallace
disclosure
to
the
regis
disclosure.
but
it's
true
that
neither
wallace
nor
carlson
in
and
of
itself,
just
all
by
itself
made
the
disclosure
of
the
regis
application.
for
that
reason,
we
do
not
rely
on
section
102
(e).
mr.
chief
justice
did
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
thought
you
had
a
question,
i'm
sorry.
now,
the
basic
doctrine
on
co-pending
patents
was
initially
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
alexander
milburn
case
which
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners
we've
already
referred
to,
a
1926
decision
of
this
court
in
which
mr.
justice
holmes
declared
for
an
unanimous
court
that
co-pending
patents
are
available
references
on
the
issue
of
patentability.
now,
that
case
involved
a
co-pending
patent
that
made
an
identical
disclosure,
but
the
reasoning
of
the
court
applied
equally
to
co-pending
patents
who's
disclosures
rendered
an
application
obvious.
thus
the
court
emphasized
the
irrationality
of
penalizing
a
prior
applicant
and
rewarding
a
subsequent
applicant
for
the
delays
of
the
patent
office,
a
consideration
no
less
applicable
where
the
prior
application
fully
discloses
the
invention
and
it
is
where
it
disclose
is
enough
to
make
the
invention
obvious.
that
no
distinction
could
be
drawn
between
these
two
kinds
of
disclosures
it
was
authoritatively
settled
by
this
court
in
detrola
corporation
against
hazeltine
corporation
in
1941,
that's
313
u.
s.
there
the
court
in
our
judgment
expressly
ruled
that
co-pending
patents
disclosing
all
but
the
obvious
are
available
references
on
the
issue
of
patentability.
we've
discussed
that
case
at
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief.
you'll
notice
at
the
bottom
of
page
14,
the
portions
we
quote.
the
court
specifically
says
that
co-pending
patents
are
among
those
that
constitute
the
prior
art
and
now
on
page
15,
the
portion
that
we
quote
makes
it
clear
that
the
court
was
focusing
not
on
the
question
of
identical
disclosure,
but
on
the
question
of
obviousness.
note
the
final
phrase
since
it's
advance
over
the
prior
art
if
any
required
only
the
exercise
of
the
skill
of
the
art
that
we
submit
is
a
clear
statement
that
the
court
was
speaking
in
terms
of
the
obviousness
issue.
that
is
to
say
that
section
103
issue
as
opposed
to
the
section
102
issue.
now,
among
the
lower
court's,
while
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
over
terminology,
the
great
majority
of
the
lower
court
decisions
rendered
between
the
milburn
case
and
the
1952
act
were
in
accord
with
the
detrola
decision.
now,
one
of
these
1952
cases
does
deserve
special
mention
we
think,
that's
western
states
machine
company
against
ss
hepworth
company,
a
1945
second
circuit
decision
rendered
by
judge
learned
hand,
that's
discussed
at
pages
16
to
18
of
our
brief.
there
judge
hand
not
only
expressly
recognized
the
detrola
case
as
settling
the
availability
of
co-pending
patents
to
show
unpatentability
for
obviousness
but
he
painstakingly
explained
why
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
treating
co-pending
patents
differently
depending
on
whether
they
make
an
identical
disclosure
or
one
that
makes
the
application
in
question
obvious.
thus,
as
of
1952
it
had
been
authoritatively
settled
by
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
lower
courts
that
co-pending
patents
are
among
the
references
available
in
judging
obviousness.
in
that
year
the
congress
enacted
as
a
part
of
the
patent
act
section
103
which
was
the
first
time
codified
the
rule
that
the
invention
is
not
patentable
where
the
prior
art,
although
not
fully
disclosing
it,
has
rendered
it
obvious
and
“to
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.”
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
as
the
examiner
put
it,
there
was
in
light
of
the
carlson
patent
that
is
the
--
those
are
the
words
that
the
patent
examiner
used
and
that
those
essentially
are
the
words
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
agreed
adequately
described
the
situation,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no
public
disclosure.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it
was
secret
until
it
issued.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
as
of
the
time
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
as
of
the
time
that
the
regis
application
was
filed.
of
course,
the
carlson
application
had
it.
the
carlson
patent
had
issued.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
so
that
that
much
of
the
--
that
much
of
the
art
was
familiar,
but
and
was
public
knowledge
but
it
is
a
fact
as
to
which
there
is
no
serious
question
that
as
of
the
time
that
the
regis
application
was
filed
the
disclosures
of
the
wallace
patent
were
secret.
they
were
maintained
in
secrecy
under
the
rules
of
the
patent
office.
now,
we
believe
that
it's
clear
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
of
course,
i
might
say
as
of
the
time
that
the
examiner
made
that
statement,
the
wallace
patent
had
already
issued,
but
of
course
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
or
to
say
whether
or
not
the
applicant
was
on
notice.
the
patent
laws
are
not
concerned
with
questions
of
notice.
i
shall
develop
somewhat
more
fully
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
we
agree
that
as
described
in
section
102
(a)
that
does
generally
describe
the
public
knowledge
of
which
patentees
are
noticed
where
they
actually
know
of
it
or
not.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
but
we
also
contend
that
the
patent
laws
require
that
in
this
instance
material
that
could
not
have
been
known
to
the
patentee,
to
the
applicant
is
chargeable
against
him
in
order
that
dual
patent
is
not
issued
on
essentially
the
same
material
or
a
material
that
does
not
differ
in
any
patentable
way.
of
course,
if
there
is
a
complete
disclosure,
if
the
wallace
patent
had
completely
disclosed
the
regis
application,
the
petitioner
would
agree
the
regis
application
could
not
have
issued
and
yet
regis
would
not
have
known
of
it
as
of
the
time
he
filed
his
application.
now,
we're
just
saying
that
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
102
(e),
that's
right
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i'm
simply
saying
that
under
the
way
in
which
the
patent
laws
are
set
up
basically
as
i
was
really
about
to
develop,
section
103
we
believe
incorporates
the
references
of
section
102.
the
face
of
section
103
in
fact
refers
to
section
102
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
103
is
referring
back
to
102.
it
doesn't
say
it's
referring
back
to
102
(a)
which
is
the
way
the
petitioner
would
read
it.
they
would
say
the
only
part
of
102
that
is
incorporated
is
102
(a).
nothing
about
that
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history,
the
references
are
to
102
generally
and
we
say
that
the
intention
was
clear
that
it
would
include
other
subsections
of
102
including
102
(e).
and
of
course,
as
of
1952
as
i've
indicated
the
courts
had
held
that
co-pending
patents
were
prior
art
for
purposes
of
determining
obviousness.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
1945
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
because
102
(a)
is
generally
considered
as
covering
things
that
were
publicly
known.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
fact
of
course
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
of
course
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
fact,
of
course
we
don't
--
we
don't
rely
on
102
(e).
we
rely
on
103
and
simply
say
that
a
co-pending
patent
is
a
part
of
the
prior
art
but
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
known
part
of
it
of
course,
would
not
be
satisfied
with
the
co-pending
patent.
i
don't
suppose
to
used
part
of
it
would
if
there
was
no
use
other
than
the
filing
of
the
application.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it
was
known
by
the
people
who
actually
filed
the
application
that's
right
your
honor.
let
me
just
say
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
that
we're
relying
primarily
on
section
102
(e).
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
on
103
as
incorporating
co-pending
patents
which
are
covered
in
102
(e)
specifically.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
now,
as
i
began
to
say
to
mr.
justice
brennan
your
honors
as
of
1952
the
decisions
of
this
court
had
established
without
any
question
that
on
the
issue
of
obviousness
co-pending
patents
were
available
references.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
it
can
be
easily
assumed
that
the
congress
would
have
abrogated
those
decisions
without
specifically
saying
so.
quite
the
contrary
of
course,
congress
made
it
quite
clear
and
in
acting
the
patent
act
of
1952
and
specifically
with
respect
to
section
103
that
it
was
intending
to
codify
existing
law
both
statutory
and
decisional.
now
in
the
year
subsequent
to
1952,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
consistency
ruled
that
co-pending
patents
are
available
references
under
section
103
and
of
course
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
on
meeting
the
question
for
the
first
time
in
the
present
case
has
adopted
that
view.
now,
the
petitioner
has
placed
great
emphasis
on
the
alleged
unfairness
of
using
as
a
reference,
a
co-pending
patent
of
which
an
applicant
cannot
have
been
aware
when
he
filed
his
application
because
of
the
secrecy
accorded
patent
applications.
this
argument
we
believe
misconceives
the
essential
nature
of
the
patent
laws.
the
public
does
not
give
patents
as
a
price
or
cleverness
or
even
ingenuity.
it
bestows
a
monopoly
in
exchange
for
a
measurable
benefit
to
the
public
in
the
way
of
an
advance
in
the
useful
arts
and
plainly
enough
an
invention
that
has
been
rendered
obvious
by
a
prior
co-pending
patent
is
if
no
benefit
to
the
public
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
the
applicant
himself
may
have
known
about
it.
thus,
the
test
of
patentability
if
not
whether
an
applicant
subjectively
believes
or
has
reason
to
believe
he
had
made
an
application
--
made
an
invention
but
whether
the
invention
represents
a
significant
advance
over
the
art
objectively
viewed.
this
objectivity
of
the
patent
laws
is
manifested
in
a
number
of
ways.
an
applicant
is
charged
with
knowledge
of
all
of
the
vast
literature
in
the
field
including
obscure
foreign
publications
of
which
you
couldn't
possibly
be
expected
to
have
knowledge.
an
applicant
who
has
conceived
a
truly
inventive
idea
through
a
genuine
stroke
of
genius
would
be
denied
a
patent
if
someone
else
had
the
idea
unbeknown
to
him
just
a
day
or
two
before.
and
as
petitioners
concede,
an
applicant
will
be
denied
a
patent
if
a
co-pending
patent
of
which
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
aware
because
of
its
secrecy
fully
disclosed
his
invention.
in
short,
we
see
no
place
for
an
argument
that
is
--
that
it
is
unfair
to
reject
an
application
that
discloses
no
patentable
advance
in
the
art
and
hence
cannot
bestow
any
benefit
on
the
public.
frankly,
if
there
is
an
issue
of
fairness
in
this
case,
we
believe
it
is
the
public
interest
in
the
due
circumscription
of
the
patents
monopoly
that
would
be
dealt
with
unfairly
if
petitioner's
view
were
to
prevail.
that
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
wallace
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
wallace
would
certainly
be
in
a
position
to
contend
of
course
that
he
was
the
first
inventor
and
to
get
an
application
--
get
a
patent
granted
on
that
account.
i
do
have
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
the
answer
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
certainly
in
the
sense
of
whether
or
not
one
has
to
be
aware
of
the
prior
art
it
would
present
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
yes
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
simply
said
that
--
that
the
questions
are
similar
in
the
sense
that
in
both
situations
there
is
some
prior
art
or
some
prior
use
or
what
have
you
of
which
the
applicant
would
have
no
way
of
discovering.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
require
no
application.
we
rely
on
section
103
your
honor
but
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
specific
answer
i
gave
was
as
far
as
a
secret
process
i
express
my
doubt
that
on
the
issue
of
patentability
other
than
determining
who
was
the
first
inventor
i
express
my
doubt
that
that
would
preclude
the
issuance
of
a
patent.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
of
course
it
would
not
be
obvious
to
him
since
he
couldn't
be
aware
of
it.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
as
i
have
said,
the
patent
laws
operate
in
terms
of
objective
advances
in
the
art,
not
in
terms
of
what
a
person
in
and
of
himself
could
know
at
any
given
time
and
i've
given
a
number
of
examples
in
which
the
patent
law
resembles
exactly
that.
for
example,
you've
just
--
we've
just
talked
about
section
102
(e)
itself.
is
that
any
less
fair
to
say
that
when
there's
another
patent,
another
application
pending
of
which
the
applicant
could
not
possible
have
known
where
that
fully
discloses
his
patent,
his
invention
that
the
applicant
is
not
entitled
to
the
issuance
of
the
patent,
yet
that
is
exactly
what
section
102
(e)
does
demonstrate.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it's
not
on
a
theory
that
it's
obvious
but
on
a
theory
that's
identical.
it's
more
than
obvious,
it's
identical.
and
we
simply
say
that
there's
no
reason
why
that
same
rule
shouldn't
apply
to
the
invention
that
is
rendered
obvious
by
what
is
already
been
filed.
we
believe
that
petitioners
due
to
the
contrary
would
allow
a
patent
to
issue
for
what
must
objectively
be
recognized
as
an
unpatentable
variation
on
an
issue
patent
and
to
that
extent
we
believed
the
standards
of
patentability
would
be
clearly
lowered.
applicants
would
reap
completely
undeserved
and
fortuitous
windfalls
as
a
result
of
the
delays
inherent
in
the
patent
application
process.
and
we
believe
that
users
of
inventions
would
be
faced
with
a
possible
necessity
of
obtaining
multiple
licenses
for
the
same
invention.
indeed,
we
believe
that
prior
patentees
would
even
have
to
obtain
a
license
to
practice
obvious
variations
on
their
own
patents.
now,
the
petitioners
have
indicated
to
the
contrary.
however,
we
believe
that
if
wallace
we
believe
first
that
wallace
was
entitled
to
practice
obvious
variations
on
his
own
patent
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
sue
for
infringement
of
anyone
who
made
an
obvious
variation
on
his
patent
and
that
would
certainly
include
the
regis
application,
the
regis
invention,
under
the
agreed
facts
of
this
case.
we
believe
there
is
no
question
but
that
wallace
would
have
been
entitled
or
would
be
entitled
to
sue
for
infringement
on
the
regis
patent
or
the
regis
invention
unless
of
course,
the
patent
should
issue
and
if
a
patent
should
issue
that
would
mean
that
wallace,
an
inventor
would
have
to
get
a
license
in
order
to
practice
variations
on
his
own
patent
that
all
other
patentees
are
allowed
to
practice
as
of
right.
finally,
we
believe
that
the
effect
of
the
petitioner's
petition
--
position
would
be
that
the
patent
monopoly
on
the
invention,
including
its
obvious
variations
would
be
extended
beyond
the
period
allowed
by
the
statute.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
such
a
view
cannot
be
squared
with
thee
essential
purposes
of
the
patent
laws
and
for
these
reasons
we
or
just
that
the
judgment
below
be
affirmed.
