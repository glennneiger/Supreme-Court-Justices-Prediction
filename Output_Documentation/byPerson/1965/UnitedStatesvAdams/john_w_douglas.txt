mr.
john
w.
douglas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims,
the
complaint
charged
united
states
for
having
infringed
the
adams
battery
patent
held
by
the
respondents.
a
commissioner
of
the
court
of
claims
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
issued
proposed
findings
and
conclusions
holding
that
the
patent
was
valid
and
that
some
batteries
of
united
states
had
infringed
that
patent.
the
full
court
of
claims
in
the
brief,
one
paragraph
per
curiam
opinion
adopted
all
of
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
its
commissioner
on
these
two
points.
the
government
sought
certiorari
and
only
one
aspect
to
the
case.
it
left
unchallenged
that
part
of
the
decision
below
holding
that
there
had
been
an
infringement
if
the
patent
were
valid.
we
brought
to
this
part
only
the
question
whether
the
adams'
patent
was
valid
patent.
the
basic
principles
involved
in
batteries
of
this
general
type
are
fairly
easy
to
grasp.
what's
involved
in
this
type
of
a
battery
are
three
elements,
two
electrodes,
and
an
electrolyte.
the
electrodes
are
metallic
stripes
or
cylinders
or
rods.
the
electrolyte
is
a
liquid
solution
and
the
electrodes
are
suspended
in
this
liquid
solution
and
if
the
electrodes
have
a
sufficiently
different
electro-motor
force
then
small
particles
of
matter
known
as
ions
will
move
from
the
positive
electrode
to
the
negative
electrode.
and
that
movement
will
take
place
through
the
liquid
solution
in
which
the
two
electrodes
are
inserted.
an
electrical
charge
can
be
recorded
and
measured
by
touching
wires
to
the
terminals
of
the
electrodes.
the
lower
court
found
that
the
adams
invention
consisted
of
a
combination
of
electrodes
and
a
combination
of
electrodes
only.
this
is
set
forth,
we
believe
in
finding
12th.
the
commissioner's
proposed
finding
which
was
subsequently
adopted
by
the
full
court.
and
as
said
forth
in
those
findings
what
the
adams'
invention
purported
to
teach
was
anode
which
is
the
positive
electrode
composed
of
magnesium
and
the
cathode
which
is
the
negative
electrode
composed
primarily
of
a
copper
salt
known
as
“cuprous
chloride”.
it
did
not
court
--
did
not
hold
that
the
invention
consisted
of
a
combination
of
these
electrodes
with
any
particular
electrolyte.
now,
this
brings
us
to
the
statutory
standards
of
utility,
novelty,
and
nonobviousness.
we
conceived
that
the
adams'
patent
was
useful.
we
raise
no
contention
on
that
point.
we
contend,
however,
that
it
meets
neither
the
test
of
novelty
nor
the
test
of
obviousness
as
set
forth
by
the
congress
in
sections
102
and
103.
so
far
as
novelty
is
concern,
we
believe
that
skrivanoff,
a
british
patent
english
issued
in
1880
is
as
dispositive.
it
was
a
combination
patent.
it
was
not
a
carbon
copy
of
adams.
adams
was
not
a
carbon
copy
of
it
in
all
respects
but
in
our
view
the
differences
are
sufficiently
mind
and
trivial
that
the
two,
after
all
intense
and
purposes
the
same.
skrivanoff
called
for
a
magnesium
anode.
adams
called
for
the
same.
skrivanoff
called
for
a
cathode
composed
of
cuprous
chloride.
adams
called
for
a
cathode
composed
of
cuprous
chloride.
skrivanoff
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
no.
i'm
going
to
continue
mr.
justice
white.
in
addition,
skrivanoff
called
for
the
addition
cuprous
chloride
of
carbon.
adams
called
for
the
addition
of
carbon
with
a
cuprous
chloride
cathode.
and
finally,
skrivanoff
however,
did
add
other
materials
to
carbon
and
to
the
cuprous
chloride.
but
in
each
cuprous
chloride
was
the
primary
element
in
the
cathode
and
there
was
no
finding,
indeed,
no
showing
that
this
omission
from
adams
of
these
extra
elements
in
skrivanoff
was
significant.
now,
the
court
sought
to
distinguish
skrivanoff
on
the
basis
of
its
non-operability
and
there
was
testimony
to
that
effect
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
inoperable.
accepting
that
finding,
we
would
say
that
operability
in
itself
does
not
establish
the
novelty
of
a
present
invention
over
a
prior
art,
or
an
element
in
that
art
because
operability
can
stand
from
a
number
of
different
changes.
it
might
have
stemmed
from
pure
materials
from
a
different
type
of
container
or
from
a
larger
electrode.
there's
no
inherent
reason
why
operability
should
stem
from
a
patentable
change.
in
this
case,
there
were
no
findings
of
the
operability
of
adams
was
caused
by
the
differences
between
the
skrivanoff
and
adams
cathode.
and
only
if
a
cause
and
effect
can
be
shown
between
the
differences
in
the
two
cathodes,
in
our
view,
can
the
differences
which
are
minor
on
their
face
be
shown
to
be
significant.
indeed,
the
record
suggests
that
skrivanoff
did
not
work
because
of
the
nature
of
electrolyte
it
employed.
and
there
was
testimony
that
the
electrolyte
in
skrivanoff
was
too
strong
and
it
had
water
being
used,
the
battery
probably
would
have
worked.
there
was
no
finding
to
this
effect.
we're
not
resting
our
case,
our
novelty
on
this
point
but
i'm
merely
saying
is
that
unless
there
are
some
findings
that
a
difference
on
operability
stems
from
a
difference
in
the
make
up
of
the
two
patents
then
there's
no
basis
for
distinguishing
the
prior
art
for
reasons
of
novelty.
and
of
course,
your
honors,
it
is
true
that
a
presumption
of
validity
normally
attaches
to
the
patent,
when
issued
by
the
patent
office.
no
such
presumption
in
our
view
should
attach
here.
the
file
wrapper
in
this
case
which
discloses
the
proceedings
in
the
patent
office
is
title
exhibit
11.
unfortunately,
we
did
not
include
that
in
the
printed
record.
it
is
a
part
of
the
original
record
file
with
the
clerk
and
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
it
can
be
referred
to
and
cited
by
the
parties.
but
an
examination
of
that
file
wrapper
indicates
no
mention
of
the
skrivanoff
patent.
and
since
the
most
important
element
in
the
prior
art
at
least
in
our
view
was
not
mentioned.
it's
difficult
to
see
how
the
patent
should
be
assumed
to
be
valid
merely
because
of
its
issuance.
at
a
minimum,
it
suggests
that
no
presumption
of
validity
should
attach
so
far
as
skrivanoff
is
concern.
this
brings
us
to
the
requirement
that
a
patent
not
be
obvious
to
a
person
skilled
in
the
art.
first,
if
a
patent
is
found
to
be
old,
that's
the
end
of
it,
can't
be
valid.
if
it's
new,
it
must
still
get
over
the
test
of
non
obviousness.
here,
the
commissioner
in
the
court
found
that
each
of
individual
components
comprising
the
adams
invention
was
known
and
had
long
been
known
in
the
art.
and
the
respondents
have
frankly
conceded
in
their
brief
that
this
was
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
below
found
that
each
of
the
individual
elements
have
been
available
for
50
years.
magnesium
is
used
as
an
electrode
had
been
anticipated
by
four
sources
cuprous
chloride
had
been
anticipated
by
three
so
that
the
question
in
terms
of
obviousness
is
whether
or
not
the
combination
of
these
individually
known
electrodes
can
be
said
not
to
have
been
obvious
to
a
person
skilled
in
the
art.
and
i
would
suggest
that
on
its
face
an
argument
to
this
effect
cannot
be
maintained.
an
electrode
does
not
exist
in
the
vacuum.
it
does
not
generate
electricity
by
itself.
it
generates
electricity
only
in
combination
with
another
electrode.
when
your
composing
a
battery
of
this
type,
you're
looking
for
possible
combinations
of
electrodes
and
your
looking
for
a
difference
in
the
electromotor
force.
if
you
have
used
magnesium
in
a
battery,
you
know
in
general
what's
its
electromotor
force
is
in
relation
to
other
elements.
same
thing
is
true
if
you
have
used
cuprous
chloride.
so
anyone
in
our
view
who
knew
that
magnesium
and
cuprous
chloride
had
been
individually
used
as
electrodes
would
have
occurred
to
him
to
at
least
try
combining
the
two
and
discover
whether
or
not
a
practical
battery
could
be
developed.
and
it
isn't
a
matter
of
just
abstract
reasoning.
there
were
suggestions
or
at
least
strong
hints
in
the
prior
literature
and
the
prior
patents,
to
the
combination
to
this
effect
was
feasible.
the
codd
treatise
in
1929
called
for
a
magnesium
anode
and
a
copper
electrode
--
copper
cathode,
juno
which
is
a
patent,
1934,
called
for
the
union
of
magnesium
on
the
one
hand,
a
lead
chloride
on
the
other.
if
one
looks
at
the
electromotor
rating
contained
in
codd
which
describes
the
various
elements
in
terms
of
their
rating
whether
they're
positive
or
negative
one
would
see
that
lead
and
copper
are
very
close.
just
as
one
would
see
that
magnesium
comes
near
the
top
of
the
scale
and
chlorine
comes
near
the
bottom
of
the
scale,
and
the
important
thing
in
an
electrode
or
one
of
the
important
things
in
choosing
an
electrode
is
to
choose
one
where
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
two
electrodes
to
be
employed
in
the
battery
itself.
and
finally
so
far
as
obviousness
is
concern,
skrivanoff
--
even
if
it
didn't
completely
anticipate
the
adams
battery,
surely
suggested
the
possibility
of
combining
magnesium
and
copper
chloride.
it
is
true
that
there
are
other
elements
not
present
in
adams
but
the
possibility
of
omitting
some
of
these
other
elements
but
not
have
been
difficult,
indeed,
would
have
been
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
someone
skilled
in
the
art
to
consider.
so
all
we
have
in
our
view
is
a
selection
of
known
battery
elements
from
a
known
and
finite
list
of
possible
components
and
a
battery
of
known
design
with
no
change
in
the
respective
functions
of
the
elements,
that
is
to
say,
the
electrodes
comprising
the
invention.
now,
the
court
in
the
respondents
seek
to
avoid
what
we
consider
to
be
the
obvious
thrust
of
the
prior
art
by
pointing
to
some
unique
characteristics
and
results
found
by
the
court
to
have
been
developed
by
the
adams
batteries.
these
findings
are
set
forth
and
the
court's
finding
23
and
there
are
two
a
number.
a
constant
current,
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
linear
potential
and
the
ability
to
operate
under
low
temperatures.
and
on
this
basis,
the
respondents
in
the
lower
court
contend
that
the
requirement
of
nonobviousness
was
satisfied.
but
this
approach
in
our
view
misconceives
the
basic
nature
of
the
obviousness
test.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
the
findings
of
the
court
on
the
contributions
of
adams
of
the
unique
nature
i
believe
are
finding
22
and
23.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
page
704
of
the
printed
record.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
this
approach
your
honors
in
our
view
doesn't
do
justice
to
the
standard
laid
down
by
the
congress
in
section
103.
what
congress
wanted
in
that
section
was
a
comparison
between
the
alleged
teachings
of
the
patent
and
the
claims
in
the
patent
and
the
prior
art.
and
one
looks
to
secondary
evidence
such
as
results
or
commercial
success
only
where
the
evidence
in
the
prior
art
is
ambiguous.
if
only
there
some
kind
of
equivocation
in
the
prior
art.
when
there
is
no
ambiguity.
when
the
prior
art
is
clear
in
terms
of
obviousness
then
one
may
look
at
this
secondary
element.
it's
a
sort
of
best
evidence
rule
which
the
courts
have
developed
and
makes
the
great
deal
of
sense
because
what
the
congress
was
seeking
to
protect
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
provisions
was
the
enhancement
of
scientific
advances
and
the
encouragements
are
the
same.
here,
the
obviousness
in
our
view
is
so
strong
that
you
don't
look
for
outside
elements
or
outside
matters
such
as
commercial
success
or
new
results.
and
i
might
say
that
even
if
and
we
would
dispute
this
most
vigorly
but
--
vigorously
but
even
if
this
were
said
to
be
a
close
question
in
terms
of
the
prior
art
the
new
results
asserted
here
would
not
have
established
patentability.
there
were
no
findings
in
this
court
of
a
long
search
for
these
particular
qualities.
it's
true
that
there
was
a
statement
that
the
individual
elements
have
been
available
for
50
years,
that
doesn't
establish
a
long
search.
it's
true
that
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
long
standing
need
that
in
itself
doesn't
establish
the
search.
and
maybe
any
number
of
reasons
why
scientists
devote
their
attention
to
one
thing
rather
than
to
another.
priorities,
problems
with
the
prior
art,
the
point
is,
what
were
looking
at
is
whether
or
not
someone
did
in
fact
searched
for
these
qualities
for
a
long
time
and
there's
no
finding
in
the
court's
record
that
this
was
so.
that
being
so
the
long
felt
need
referred
to
by
the
court
would
not
have
been
important
even
if
these
were
a
close
question
on
the
prior
art.
we
don't
believe
that
it
was
a
close
question.
so
the
respondent
seems
to
be
saying
in
our
view
that
the
standard
of
invention
is
met
if
new
results
are
achieved.
but
this
court
had
said
as
far
back
as
in
nap
against
morris,
150
u.s.
221,
that
one
can't
get
a
patent
on
new
results.
patents
are
given
on
devices,
on
processes,
on
embodiments,
they're
not
given
on
results
anymore
than
there
given
on
ideas.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
i'll
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
yes,
i
do.
i
would
say
that
it
comes
into
play
only
when
the
prior
art
is
equivocal
and
ambiguous.
so
in
conclusion
your
honors,
i
would
suggest
the
two
basic
elements
in
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
present
this
court
with
significant
and
important
questions
which
should
be
resolved.
the
first
is
according
to
the
lower
court
that
operability
will
distinguish
one
patent
from
its
prior
reference.
we
disagree
with
that.
we
think
there
has
to
be
a
finding
with
the
operability
in
fact
stemmed
from
the
difference
between
the
two
patents
themselves.
the
second
paragraph
which
the
lower
court
committed
was
that
it
seemed
to
be
precluding
that
new
results
in
and
of
themselves
was
sufficiently
to
get
over
the
test
of
nonobviousness
set
forth
in
section
103.
and
i
think
it
important
in
preserving
the
delicate
balance
which
this
court
has
long
monitored
between
competitive
enterprise
on
the
one
hand
and
patent
monopoly
on
the
other
that
these
two
doctrines
be
as
--
made
clear
that
they're
not
applicable
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
the
claims
themselves
mr.
white
included
a
reference
to
electrolyte
but
the
lower
court
found
that
the
essence
of
the
invention
consisted
of
claims
one
and
ten.
and
there's
a
statement
in
the
opinion
of
the
same
effect
on
the
record
646.
there
is
no
mention
of
the
electrolyte
in
the
specifications
which
are
quoted
in
the
court's
findings
and
accordingly
taking
the
court's
findings
we
contend
if
the
invention
has
been
confined
to
a
combination
of
the
electrodes.
now,
i
can
understand
if
i
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
quite
aside
from
the
electrolyte,
i
would
say
that
i
think
--
i
could
understand
why
the
court
didn't
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
electrolyte
was
part
of
the
invention.
there
was
substantial
prior
art
on
the
electrolyte
and
juno
had
a
electrolyte
in
1934
of
the
similar
nature,
that's
at
record
572.
niaudet
who
was
a
treaty's
writer
had
a
water
electrolyte
suggested,
that's
at
record
505
and
accordingly,
i
think
that
may
have
been
the
reason
why
the
court
did
not
find
electrolyte
to
be
part
of
the
invention.
the
significant
fact
is,
they
did
so
find.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
if
the
court
please,
so
far
as
constant
current
is
concerned,
that
had
been
suggested
in
a
number
of
prior
references,
wensky,
niaudet,
hayes,
and
jiu-mao
all
contained
in
the
record
and
the
suggestion
in
those
prior
references
was
that
a
metallic
chloride
would
do
the
trick.
when
this
battery
was
taken
up
to
fort
monmouth,
difficulty
was
that
it
boiled
over
and
that's
what
put
the
army
scientist
off.
but
i
think
the
significant
point
about
my
res
--
distinguished
opponents
argument
is
that
it
was
devoted
almost
entirely
to
results.
there
was
no
detailed
effort
to
justify
the
scientific
events
in
terms
of
the
prior
art
except
to
say
that
one
was
operable
and
the
other
wasn't
and
that
something
else
achieve
certain
results
whereas
others
had
not.
even
if
what
he
said
was
absolutely
correct,
this
would
still
not
established
patentability
because
the
test
under
section
103
is,
had
this
been
apparent
to
someone
skilled
in
the
field
in
the
prior
art
and
there's
no
findings
that
there
was
any
such
seach
in
this
case
and
in
fact
the
comparison
of
the
skrivanoff
and
adams'
bat
--
patents
saw
that
they're
virtually
congruent.
and
for
these
two
reasons
we
believe
that
patentability
should
not
be
sustained.
