mr.
john
a.
reilly
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
as
my
brother
douglas
has
said,
the
claims
of
the
patent
that
are
involved
in
suit,
the
entire
11
and
we
have
relied
primarily
upon
claims
one
and
ten
as
being
exemplary.
claim
one
of
the
adams'
patents
reads,
a
battery
comprising
a
liquid
container,
a
magnesium
electropositive
electrode
inside
the
container
and
having
an
exterior
terminal.
a
fused
cuprous
chloride
electronegative
electrode
and
a
terminal
connector
with
said
electronegative
electrode.
claim
ten
calls
in
a
battery,
the
combination
of
a
magnesium
electropositive
electrode
and
an
electronegative
electrode
comprising
cuprous
chloride
fused
with
the
carbon
catalytic
agent.
these
elements
had
all
been
available
in
the
art
for
more
than
50
years
prior
to
adams
had
--
went
on
the
scene.
magnesium
was
isolated
in
1854,
became
commercially
available
in
1870,
was
suggested
by
skrivanoff
in
1888.
cuprous
chloride
came
into
the
art
about
the
same
time
and
was
mentioned
by
skrivanoff
the
proto-chloride
of
copper
means
cuprous
chloride
as
a
government
contends.
in
the
skrivanoff
recipe
--
in
skrivanoff
disclosure
which
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
about.
we
had
cathode
which
comprised
carbon
or
copper
paste
with
the
paste
of
phosphoric
acid,
amorphous
phosphorous,
metallic
copper,
and
cuprous
chloride,
mixed
together
with
sulfuric
acid
and
applied
hot
to
the
carbon
and
covered
with
blotting
paper
impregnated
with
zinc
chloride
and
sulfuric
acid.
and
when
our
expert
put
that
together
with
the
pure
materials
that
he
had
available
in
1960
and
i
don't
know
that
the
materials
in
1888
were
any
purer.
he
had
two
files.
that
was
the
use
of
cuprous
chloride.
i
asked
the
government's
expert
when
he
testified
as
to
skrivanoff
whether
when
the
mixture
of
the
cathode
was
put
together.
did
it
still
contain
cuprous
chloride?
and
he
said,
i
don't
know?
all
i
have
is
the
information
concerned
contained
in
the
patent
and
beyond
that
i
had
no
information
whatsoever.
following
that,
our
expert
attempted
to
put
the
entire
skrivanoff
battery
together
including
the
magnesium
anode
and
the
electrolytes
specified
by
skrivanoff
and
he
had
an
explosion
which
blew
out
the
vent
of
his
laboratory
which
is
the
device
for
exhausting
air.
and
at
that
point,
he
stopped
working
on
skrivanoff.
now,
the
interesting
thing
about
this
battery
and
i
would
really
like
to
show
it
to
you.
i've
taken
the
trouble
or
the
effort
here
of
putting
together
the
parts
of
it
because
it's
so
very
simple.
this
is
a
piece
of
magnesium
which
i
have
bent
over.
started
out
like
this,
it's
now
bent
this
way
and
this
is
a
cuprous
chloride
electrode
which
has
been
combined
with
a
bit
of
carbon
and
it
takes
about
five
minutes
to
make
it.
you
take
a
piece
of
cuprous
screening
such
as
you
use
the
mosquito
netting
and
you
draw
it
through
a
crucible
of
cuprous
chloride
and
you
get
this
sort
of
plating
out
on
the
wire.
and
i
connected
the
two
electrodes
together
to
a
bowl
and
i
might
say
that
i'm
going
to
put
this
together
using
the
method
taught
by
alessandro
volta
in
1880
--
mr.
john
a.
reilly
i
beg
your
pardon?
i
hope
not.
but
this
is
a
very,
very
simple
thing.
you
just
take
a
piece
of
kleenex
and
wrap
it
around
the
cathode
so
as
to
prevent
a
short
circuit
between
the
cathode
and
the
anode.
then
you
put
the
cathode
inside
the
anode
and
hopefully
it'll
work.
now,
actually
since
1800
everyone
has
known
that
this
combination
really
can't
work.
batteries
were
invented
by
the
great
italian
scientist,
alessandro
volta
in
1880
--
1800
and
at
that
time,
he
determined
by
a
very
simple
experiment.
he
used
a
sheet
of
silver,
a
piece
of
silver
and
a
piece
of
copper,
between
them
he
put
a
little
piece
of
cardboard.
and
he
took
that
battery
and
soaked
it
in
water.
first
water-activated
battery
and
the
first
one
that
didn't
worked.
and
immediately
determined
that
since
it
didn't
worked
he
had
add
substances
such
as
salts
or
basic
materials
or
acids
to
the
water
in
order
to
produce
the
ions
that
my
brother
douglas
has
mentioned
so
that
electricity
can
be
conducted
by
the
water.
pure
water
is
an
insulator.
it
will
not
conduct
electricity.
magnesium
is
insoluble
than
water.
so
is
cuprous
chloride.
so
is
cuprous
chloride
with
carbon,
insoluble
in
water
so
when
you
put
the
two
substances
into
water
neither
one
can
dissolve
in
the
water.
you
can't
get
a
chemical
reaction
to
form
a
conductive
electrolyte
and
the
water
remaining
can
conduct
electricity,
so
on
the
basis
of
conventional
voltaic
theory,
this
battery
cannot
operate.
and
that's
the
very
good
reason
why
nobody
bought
it
with
these
things
together.
as
the
expert
the
trial
testified,
in
1939
it
was
ridiculous
for
adams
to
take
two
insoluble
substances
like
magnesium
and
cuprous
chloride
and
put
them
in
an
insulator
like
water
and
expect
to
have
a
battery.
now,
if
i
have
some
water
which
of
course
(inaudible).
mr.
john
a.
reilly
now
specifically,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
battery
is
not
new,
it
is
useful
and
it's
obvious.
there
is
a
very
short
answer
to
this
and
the
answer
is
this.
if
the
components
of
adams
had
been
put
together
before,
the
battery
would
have
had
the
characteristics
of
the
adams
battery.
chemicals
are
chemicals.
they
work
the
same
way
every
time
if
you
have
the
same
chemicals.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
has
never
been
a
battery
prior
to
adams
that
had
its
characteristics.
the
adams
battery
characteristics
are
opposite
in
most
cases
to
every
prior
art
battery,
a
140
years
of
battery
research.
this
is
the
first
different
battery
since
volta
invented
the
battery
of
1800.
secondly,
the
government
says
it's
obvious
but
when
adams
took
his
battery
a
month
after
pearl
harbor
and
went
to
fort
monmouth
as
he
was
directed
to
do
and
displayed
it
to
the
assembled
battery
experts
including
dr.
fishback
and
dr.
mendel,
who
later
on
filed
their
owned
patent
on
the
same
battery,
they
looked
at
the
battery
working
in
front
of
them
with
a
steam
coming
out
of
it
and
told
adams
it
can't
work.
that's
the
battery
the
government
say's
is
obvious.
now,
i'll
put
in
the
water.
now,
i'm
using
warm
water
here,
hopefully
so
that
this
battery
may
activate
before
my
30
minutes
are
up.
the
government
relies
upon
two
additional
references,
the
niaudet
text
and
the
hayes
--
and
the
hayes
patent.
both,
well,
i
think
niaudet
with
1880
and
hayes
is
1883.
the
niaudet
text
teaches
the
second
water-activated
battery.
my
brother
just
--
my
brother
douglas
is
correct
on
this
and
in
the
same
text
if
you
read
it
and
you'll
find
it
at
page
--
record
515
on
the
same
or
the
next
page
it
says
that
the
niaudet
battery
which
was
actually
the
marie
davy
battery
did
not
work
and
it
didn't
work
until
another
scientist
named
de
la
rue
came
along
and
put
salts
or
sal
ammoniac
in
the
water
and
then
the
battery
worked.
so
the
art
had
it's
understanding
of
the
battery
theory
reinforced
by
niaudet.
you
have
to
take
all
of
the
government's
references
put
together
because
when
you
take
the
totality
of
the
government's
references
in
conjunction
with
the
ones
that
adams
put
in,
you
arrive
at
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
what
the
government
and
adams
combined
to
prove
was
that
no
one
in
the
battery
art
believed
that
water
could
possibly
function
in
a
battery.
everybody
in
the
battery
art
knew
that
you
couldn't
use
magnesium
in
a
battery
and
the
cuprous
chloride
had
never
been
successfully
used
in
any
practical
battery
and
that's
the
totality
of
the
government's
art
and
ours.
mr.
john
a.
reilly
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
see
that
small
light
that
i
have
there,
it's
only
a
one
and
a
half
volt
lamp.
that's
all
that
this
battery
will
produce
itself.
what
you
say
mr.
justice
white
is
quite
correct.
bert
adams
was
not
a
scientist.
he
didn't
know
that
what
he
was
doing
was
impossible.
he
didn't
know
that
the
combination
he
put
together
was
ridiculous.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
be
fair
to
adams,
adams
is
a
natural
genius
and
he
disbelieved
these
theories
that
i've
been
talking
about.
he
said
that
magnesium
is
soluble
in
water.
and
he
believed
that
cuprous
chloride
could
be
solublized
in
water.
and
he
believed
that
water
could
carry
a
conductive
electrolyte
in
combination
with
the
magnesium
and
he
is
the
only
one
who
is
right.
so
untutored
or
not,
he
is
a
bona
fide
natural
genius
and
understand
the
conditions
under
which
this
man
worked.
he
had
no
laboratory.
he
made
his
experimental
batteries
that
he
delivered
to
the
army
by
the
dozens
on
his
kitchen
stove.
these
were
the
people
watching
this
untutored
man
come
in
and
you
can
understand
why
they
had
difficulty
believing
him.
he
just
didn't
looked
prepossessing,
he
didn't
appear
to
be
the
type
that
you
would
think
could
be
a
great
scientist
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
if
you
go
back
to
battery
science
you
have
to
say
that
since
volta,
there
has
been
edison,
adams
--
now,
the
18
--
mr.
john
a.
reilly
oh
yes!
mr.
john
a.
reilly
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
--
mr.
john
a.
reilly
oh,
quite
correct.
that's
proven
by
the
article
dr.
fishback
wrote
in
1952
where
he
said,
“when
we
looked
at
this
battery
originally
we
thought
that
because
of
its
self-initiation
and
exothermic
reaction
was
inoperative
but
now
we
realized
that
those
two
characteristics
give
it
two
of
his
most
important
advantages
and
that's
why
it
files
this
patent
on
it.
and
my
brother
douglas
finds
both
with
the
claims
of
adams,
but
if
you
read
the
claims
of
fishback,
you
will
find
that
fishback
is
claiming
a
battery
with
a
magnesium
anode
and
a
cuprous
chloride
cathode
with
carbon
in
it
except
he
said
that
my
battery
is
porous.
he
didn't
tell
the
united
states
patent
office
which
the
department
of
justice
sometime
excoriates
that
the
adams'
patent
taught
how
to
make
the
cathode
porous
by
the
use
of
carbon.
and
the
1880
niaudet
reference
which
has
just
been
referred
to
taught
the
exact
method
that
fishback
used
to
make
his
electrode.
so
that
the
invention
of
fishback
is
anticipated
by
the
art
that
is
cited
by
the
government
today,
yet
the
government
has
not
disclaimed
that
patent,
it
is
still
viable,
it
could
be
asserted
against
anyone.
indeed,
it
could
be
asserted
against
adams.
now
the
third
reference,
the
fourth
reference
presently
relied
on
by
the
government
is
codd.
and
the
codd
textbook
i
think
is
the
most
devastating
answer
to
the
government's
case.
it's
a
textbook
published
in
1928.
it's
fairly
extensive
in
three
places,
widely
separate.
it
mentions
one,
magnesium,
and
teaches
that
if
you
put
magnesium
into
a
sulfuric
acid
opposed
to
copper
you
can
measure
its
electromotive
force.
two
other
or
three
other
references
put
in
by
the
government
teach
that
if
you
put
magnesium
and
sulfuric
acid
it
will
be
destroyed
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
other
references
put
in
by
the
government
teach,
teach
no
one
knew
how
to
use
magnesium
in
a
primary
battery
as
of
1928.
so
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
what
codd
was
teaching
was
merely
an
electrical
measurement
method,
it
was
not
a
battery.
the
second
substance
mentioned
by
codd
is
silver
chloride
40
pages
away
from
the
mention
of
magnesium.
the
third
being
mentioned
by
codd
is
that
the
arts
was
trying
to
make
water-activated
batteries
and
it
gave
several
examples.
and
these
water-activated
batteries
were
made
by
putting
the
salts
which
you
need
to
make
the
water
conductive
into
the
interstices
between
the
electrodes.
then
you
pour
the
water
in,
the
salts
are
melted
by
the
water
and
the
battery
becomes
conductive
and
operative.
so
there
in
codd
mind
you,
is
magnesium,
silver
chloride,
and
water.
no
one
suggested
that
they
could
ever
be
put
together.
codd
didn't
suggest
that.
the
closest
the
government
comes
to
anticipating
adams
is
defined
that
almost
all
of
the
substances
used
by
adams
which
were
cuprous
chloride
magnesium
activate
the
battery
with
water
were
combined
in
a
book,
not
in
a
battery,
1928
ten
years
before
adams.
now,
actually
all
of
the
references
are
distinguished
because
of
the
ref
--
several
references
cited
by
my
brother
douglas.
he
mentioned
jiu
mao,
and
jiu
mao
was
a
patent
in
1937,
just
two
years
before
adams
and
jiu
mao
said,
“here
is
the
way
you
make
magnesium
work
in
a
battery.”
jiu
mao
doesn't
work.
the
testimony
shows
adams'
expert,
faithfully
reproduced
jiu
mao
tested
it.
it
does
not
function.
that's
jiu
mao.
the
second
one
is
that
silver
chloride
is
cited
by
the
government
and
may
refer
to
the
hayes
and
niaudet,
those
patents.
now,
at
the
trial,
adams
insisted
that
cuprous
chloride
which
he
disclosed
in
his
patent
and
silver
chloride
which
is
not
disclosed
in
his
patent
but
which
he
told
the
army
about
in
1942
were
equivalent.
you
said
they'll
both
work
in
my
battery.
we
put
in
eight
requested
findings
of
fact
to
the
commissioner
requesting
the
commissioner
to
find
that
cuprous
chloride
and
silver
chloride
were
equivalents.
the
government
opposed
them
all.
the
commissioner
in
his
decision
stated
that
he
refused
to
find
that
cuprous
chloride
and
silver
chloride
were
equivalent,
he
therefore
held
that
the
government's
procurement
of
silver
chloride,
magnesium,
water-activated
batteries
was
not
an
infringement.
we
acquiesced
the
government
with
no
exceptions.
now
the
government
comes
to
you
and
says
in
its
petition
for
the
reason
for
granting
certiorari.
cuprous
chloride
and
silver
chloride
are
equivalence
and
you
should
reverse
the
commissioner
because
he
didn't
in
fact
find
that.
in
other
words,
they
ask
you
to
reverse
the
commissioner
on
a
finding
of
fact
--
for
filing
to
find
or
for
making
a
decision
that
they
themselves
induced
the
commissioner
to
make.
and
as
you
know
we
have
a
motion
pending
on
that.
now,
to
get
to
the
point
about
the
battery
being
unobvious,
the
reason
the
adams
battery
could
--
the
reason
the
scientist
couldn't
believe
the
adam's
battery
when
saw
it
operating
is
because
in
fact
it
does
not
operate
like
any
other
battery.
i
have
here
a
draft
which
is
a
copy
of
plaintiff's
exhibit
38
with
the
exception
of
the
two
ledgers.
and
this
graph
was
made
by
a
battery
scientist
at
fort
monmouth
named
shore.
now,
shore
was
not
one
of
the
men
that
adams
talked
to.
shore
was
the
man
who
was
given
a
--
just
simply
a
copy
of
the
adams'
patent
and
asks
to
do
some
experimentation.
and
the
experimentation
he
did
was
to
follow
that
art
and
make
several
batteries.
this
is
one
of
them.
and
if
you
see
this
curve,
this
flat
line
going
out
about
three-quarters
away
across
the
graph
that
is
the
curve
of
the
battery
he
made
following
simply
the
instructions
in
the
adams'
patent.
now,
he
had
some
other
duties
that
were
not
fully
explained
but
at
any
event
he
took
each
of
the
elements
in
the
adam's
patent
such
as
magnesium
and
he
tried
all
kinds
of
other
chlorides
with
it.
and
then
he
would
take
cuprous
chloride
and
find
all
kinds
of
different
metals
with
it.
and
then
he
experimented
with
different
types
of
electrolytes
and
he
found
out
that
the
only
combination
that
worked
was
the
one
that
adams
thought.
all
the
others
were
failures.
at
the
same
time
he
ran
some
tests
on
two
commercial
colesman's
(ph)
batteries
which
at
that
time
and
this
is
1944
were
being
procured
by
the
government
for
high
altitude
meteorological
research
and
he
plotted
the
curves
of
the
voltage
delivery
of
those
two
batteries
and
here
you
see
that
they
go
down.
now
this
is
an
experimental
adams
battery,
built
by
a
man
who
built
two
or
three
of
them
against
the
best
commercial
procurements
of
batteries
that
the
government
could
manage
in
the
middle
of
the
war.
your
honors,
this
is
the
real
prior
arts.
this
is
what's
skrivanoff
pays
niaudet,
codd
and
all
of
the
rest
of
them
taught
the
battery
art.
you
couldn't
make
a
battery
that
would
give
you
any
constant
current
on
continuous
service.
you
couldn't
make
a
battery
that
didn't
show
an
early
failure.
this
battery
of
adams
is
the
first
battery
that
would
give
continuous
power
efficiently.
every
other
battery
when
you
put
it
on
in
continuous
service
declines
so
fast
that
it
reached
the
point
of
an
operativenss
--
even
operativeness
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
this
is
the
first
battery
that
will
give
a
level
power
like
a
generator.
and
practically
every
electrical
device,
radio
sending
or
receiving
sets,
whatever
it
may
be
requires
level
electrical
power
to
work
efficiently.
it
cannot
work
efficiently
on
declining
(inaudible)
fading
radios
and
various
other
patents.
the
third
thing
about
this
battery
and
the
reason
why
the
battery
scientists
at
fort
monmouth
had
so
much
trouble
understanding
how
it
could
work
is
that
when
adams
demonstrated
it
and
i
don't
think
you
can
see
that
here
there's
too
much
water
but
the
battery
heats
up
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
will
boil.
the
water
in
the
adams
battery
will
actually
come
to
a
boil,
steam
will
come
out
of
it.
now,
every
prior
art
voltaic
battery,
when
it
begin
to
heat
up
it
was
polarizing,
losing
power
and
destroying
itself.
in
the
adams
battery
the
heating
reaction
is
pure
side
reaction,
it
does
not
affect
the
level
--
continuous
production
of
electrical
power
whatsoever.
but,
because
of
the
boiling
phenomenon
the
government
felt
and
these
experts
felt
that
this
was
a
battery
that
was
running
away
and
destroying
itself.
in
fact
it
is
the
boiling
of
the
adams
battery
that
permits
the
battery
to
operate
at
-960
degrees
below
zero.
almost
a
100
degrees
below
the
freezing
temperature
of
the
water
it's
filled
with
and
this
is
the
battery
that
has
licked
the
age
old
problem
in
the
battery
art
of
low
temperature
performance.
there
is
no
other
battery
that
will
work
well
at
60
degrees
below
zero.
there's
just
isn't.
and
the
adams
battery
today
is
used
by
the
government
for
more
unusual
and
usual
uses
than
any
other
battery.
this
battery
for
example
is
used
in
meteorological
research.
its
sent
up
to
a
100,000
feet
in
the
stratosphere
where
the
temperature
goes
down
to
60
degrees
below
zero
and
this
is
the
only
battery
that
will
work
under
those
conditions
effectively.
mr.
john
a.
reilly
now,
there
were
other
reasons
why
the
government
experts
could
not
believe
that
it
worked.
and
these
are
the
reasons
why
the
battery
is
not
really
obvious.
you
can't
start
this
battery
when
you
want
to.
it
isn't
like
everyone
of
the
prior
art
batteries
which
--
they
are
both
experts
at
the
trial
called
a
bell
ringer,
when
they
pushed
the
button,
the
battery
delivers
current
and
the
bell
rings,
when
you
take
your
finger
off
the
button
it
stops.
the
adams
battery
won't
do
that.
it
takes
a
half
hour
to
start
the
adams
battery
if
you
put
it
together
unless
you
use
special
methods
such
as
hot
water
to
energize
it
rapidly
and
if
you
don't
do
that
the
bat
--
and
another
thing
about
the
battery
is
that
you
can't
stop
it.
i
can
des
--i
can
take
that
bulb
out
and
break
the
external
circuit,
that
battery
will
go
right
on
boiling
and
generating
and
using
itself
up.
that's
what
the
government
experts
called
a
self-destructive
feature.
the
other
thing
about
it
of
course
is
the
fact
that
it
boils
over
and
conventionally
all
the
experts
know
that
a
battery
that
heats
up
was
destroying
itself.
now,
we
say
that
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
adams
battery
is
simply
not
new
and
simply
obvious
because
it
doesn't
wish
to
address
itself,
so
the
real
question
for
which
possibly
this
court
granted
certiorari.
we
feel
that
if
you
apply
the
test
which
were
set
forth
in
the
a
&
p
case
and
in
cuno
and
in
ray-o-vac
and
when
i
refer
to
the
anp
case
i
refer
to
both
the
majority
in
the
concurring
opinions.
we
feel
that
when
you
apply
the
facts
of
records
to
those
criteria,
you'll
find
that
adams
meets
the
criteria
of
anp
completely.
for
example,
in
anp
it
was
stated
that
as
a
result
of
the
combination
there
had
to
be
something
unusual,
the
whole
had
to
be
greater
that
the
sum
of
the
parts.
now
what
does
that
mean?
supposing
a
battery
that
the
whole
were
just
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
parts,
you're
using
a
better
anode,
a
better
cathode,
possibly
energize
it
in
some
better
way.
you
would
get
a
better
conventional
battery.
these
carriers
might
have
come
out
a
little
further.
but
it
would
still
be
a
bell
ringer.
it
would
still
give
you
only
intermittent
as
opposed
to
continuous
power.
it
would
still
give
you
only
declining
power
as
opposed
to
leveled
power
and
it
wouldn't
work
at
low
temperatures.
in
the
adams
battery
you
put
together
an
anode
and
a
cathode
and
what
do
you
get?
you
get
a
battery
that's
not
like
any
other
battery,
indeed
it's
more
like
a
heat
engine
than
a
battery.
and
it
develops
power
in
a
way
that
it's
none
like
a
battery
but
indeed
is
like
a
generator.
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts.
the
second
point
made
i
believe
in
anp
was
that
it
is
necessary
that
the
useful
arts
in
majority
opinion
or
the
particular
science
involved
had
to
be
greatly
advanced.
in
this
case
it
would
be
the
science
of
electrochemistry.
i
don't
think
the
government
disputes
that
the
science
of
electrochemistry
has
been
greatly
advanced
by
adams.
here
we
have
the
first
unexplained
experimental
results
since
volta.
the
voltaic
theory
no
longer
fits
all
observed
experimental
phenomena
in
the
battery
field.
the
next
point
is
--
mr.
john
a.
reilly
yes
your
honor.
no
one
really
understands
this.
there
are
three
things
that
are
unexplained
about
the
adams
battery.
first
of
all,
no
one
understands
why
this
combination
does
generate
current.
secondly,
no
one
understands
why
this
delivery
curve
of
voltage
remains
leveled.
this
is
a
primary
battery.
you
put
the
parts
in
it
with
all
the
electrical
energy
when
you
put
it
together.
and
then
as
it
grows
older
and
is
used
there's
less
and
less
material
and
you
would
expect
and
indeed
all
prior
art
batteries
decline
as
you
have
less
material,
less
magnesium,
whatever
it
may
be
working
in
the
battery.
this
does
not
and
no
one
can
understand
why
it
doesn't
go
down.
almost
every
curve
that
you
see
in
nature
are
natural
phenomenon
has
a
curve
to
it.
that's
why
they're
called
curves.
this
is
the
first
straight
line
curve
and
when
it
comes
to
the
end
of
it's
life
it
falls
right
off
the
cliff,
this
peculiar
little
zigzag
in
this
graph
is
due
to
the
fact
that
mr.
shore
lets
its
battery
run
out
of
water.
so
you
put
some
water
in
it,
gaining
back
the
life
and
decline.
mr.
john
a.
reilly
that's
correct.
mr.
--
mr.
john
a.
reilly
(inaudible)
mr.
john
a.
reilly
yes.
yes,
magnesium
is
not
soluble
in
water.
to
any
substantial
degree
i
might
say
that
magnesium
is
soluble
in
boiling
water.
so
i
suppose
if
you
want
to
make
a
battery
out
of
magnesium
all
you
have
to
do
is
create
one
that
will
boil
and
if
that's
the
answer
this
is
the
only
boiling
battery,
that's
true
though.
the
second
point
or
the
last
point
and
this
particularly
applied
to
the
concurring
opinion
in
anp
with
the
requirement
that
masters
in
the
field
of
electrochemistry
should
have
recognized
the
contribution
to
be
an
important
scientific
advance.
and
in
that
connection
i
would
like
to
just
mention
briefly
what
the
masters
in
the
field
of
electrochemistry
have
said
about
the
adams
battery.
dr.
fishback,
magnesium,
cuprous
chloride
batteries
have
obtained
considerable
importance
particularly
as
meteorological
batteries.
dr.
chove
(ph)
in
1952,
the
exact
nature
of
the
complex
chemical
current
producing
reactions
of
this
type
of
cell
is
not
known
in
any
substantial
detail.
morse,
the
water-activated
battery
systems
are
among
the
relatively
new
power
sources
which
have
become
extremely
important
to
the
military
during
the
past
decade.
morse,
the
definite
trend
to
water-activated
batteries
for
high
altitude
and
seawater
applications
indicates
they
are
unsurpassed
as
one
shot
power
packs
for
low
temperature
use
and
for
underwater
operations.
morse,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
addition
of
water-activated
batteries
to
the
family
of
power
sources
has
brought
about
developments
which
would
otherwise
have
been
technically
or
economically
impractical.
recognition
by
outstanding
experts
in
the
field
of
electrochemistry
that
this
untutored
simple
man
has
made
an
important
advance
in
the
science
of
electrochemistry
and
i
think
the
requirements
that
this
court
enunciated
in
anp
for
invention
have
been
fully
met
by
adams
and
beyond
that
i
think
the
statement
in
cuno
has
been
met.
i
think
this
is
surely
a
work
of
creative
genius
not
merely
the
skill
of
the
calling.
thank
you.
