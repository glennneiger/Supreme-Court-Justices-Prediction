mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
presented
here
by
the
petitioners
is
in
our
opinion
only
a
superficial
resemblance
to
the
case
that
was
tried
below.
the
reason
is
that
they
disregard
facts
and
findings
which
in
our
opinion
call
for
dismissal
of
this
appeal
before
getting
to
the
questions
that
they
presented
for
review.
i'd
like
first
to
--
just
to
state
some
of
these
main
facts
and
findings.
first,
there's
the
fact
that
the
courts
below
unanimously
found
that
the
proof
did
not
show
that
allan
p.
kirby
was
guilty
of
any
fraud
or
failure
to
volunteer
evidence
in
the
zenn
proceedings.
no
question
has
been
presented
here
challenging
that
this
finding
is
erroneous
under
rule
52.
yet
the
petitioner's
main
brief
just
like
the
pleadings
and
like
this
rule
16
statement
of
issue
--
issues
before
the
district
court
repeatedly
states
that
kirby
was
guilty
of
deceit
and
that
he
knowingly
joined
in
a
fraud
on
the
part
of
others
on
the
referee.
the
unchallenged
findings
in
the
record
are
to
the
contrary.
there
was
a
complete
failure
of
proof
on
this
basic
issue
in
this
case.
secondly,
there
are
the
findings
of
the
courts
below
that
the
documents
allegedly
concealed
were
cumulative
or
irrelevant.
these
findings
took
into
consideration
not
only
the
ids
projections
that
was
received
in
evidence
in
this
case,
but
also
those
that
were
excluded.
no
question
has
been
presented
to
this
court
here
challenging
these
findings.
yet
petitioners
repeatedly
say
that
this
evidence
was
in
their
words
crucial
and
would
have
destroyed
the
zenn
defense.
now,
we
have
analyzed
each
one
of
these
12
documents
that
were
allegedly
concealed
and
compared
them
with
those
that
were
before
the
referee
in
point
--
we've
done
that
in
points
one
and
four
of
our
brief,
main
brief.
and
we
submit
that
that
shows
that
they
add
nothing
to
what
was
already
before
the
zenn
referee.
and
at
pages
34
and
35
of
our
brief,
we
list
the
projections
and
other
documents
forecasting
income
that
were
before
the
zenn
referee.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
our
view
that
even
if
you
apply,
the
might
have
or
the
would
have
standards,
the
documents
when
you
set
them
down
opposite
what
was
before
the
zenn
referee
showed
that
they
add
nothing
of
any
significance
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
--
to
the
facts
before
him.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
our
view
mr.
justice
white
is
that
it's
the
state
law
that
should
be
applied
since
we
are
dealing
here
with
what
amounts
to
a
standard
of
proof
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
that
is
the
zenn
proceeding
and
therefore
one
should
abide
by
the
state
law
because
of
course,
it
could
have
a
very
substantial
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
i
submit
justice
white
that
that
was
not
a
14
(a)
proceeding
for
the
reason
that
it
was
adjudicated
by
the
state
court
itself
not
once
but
repeatedly
to
be
a
cause
of
action
rooted
in
common
law
in
which
the
allegations
with
respect
to
section
14
(a)
were
incidental
or
as
i
think
was
set
by
the
referee
and
then
affirmed
by
the
new
york
supreme
court
and
expresses.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
as
an
original
matter,
it
was
in
our
opinion
a
common
law
cause
of
action
in
the
state
court.
the
mention
of
section
14
(a)
was
merely
incidental.
i
think
that
the
pleader,
the
complainant
had
a
choice.
he
could
have
pleaded
it
as
common
law
cause
of
action
or
as
a
violation
of
section
14
(a).he
chose
to
plead
it
as
a
common
law
cause
of
action.
he
pursued
it
all
through
the
courts
twice
having
it
adjudicated
on
appeal
within
the
state
courts
and
he
never
sought
review
here
of
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
14
(a)
cause
of
action.
our
position
is
therefore
that
he
is
bound
under
the
doctrine
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
durfee
against
goo
--
duke
by
the
adjudication
of
the
state
court.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
there
are
other
bases
besides
the
--
that
or
other
hurdles
which
must
be
jumped
before
one
would
set
aside
this
appeal
and
i
was
coming
to
them
if
i
may.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
i'm
afraid
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
well,
the
third
fact
of
significance
to
us
and
i
think
perhaps
follows
just
what
justice
white
was
pursuing
is
that
except
for
the
so-called
corrupt
bargain
claim
below
in
this
action,
dismissal
of
which
after
trial
was
never
appealed,
the
sole
issue
alleged
presented
under
rule
16
and
tried
before
the
district
court
was
whether
or
not
kirby
had
defrauded
the
zenn
referee,
not
young,
not
purcell
but
solely
kirby.
there
was
no
claim
below
of
fraud
in
the
part
of
young
and
purcell
and
no
claim
against
kirby
based
on
any
fraud
by
them.
no
such
issue
was
tried.
petitioner's
counsel
expressly
disclaimed
any
such
charge.
the
complaint
was
limited
to
kirby's
conduct
and
after
20,000
pages
of
depositions,
and
a
series
of
rule
16
pretrial
conferences,
the
statement
of
issues
was
limited
to
kirby's
conduct
it
read,
did
kirby
procured
by
fraud
certain
judgment.
young
and
purcell
were
never
involved
either
in
the
corrupt
bargain
claim
which
was
dismissed
in
every
appeal.
yet
the
petitioners
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
inject
the
charge
that
young
and
purcell
committed
a
fraud
upon
the
zenn
referee.
judge
friendly
accepted
that
charge
as
the
cornerstone
of
his
dissent
and
the
only
basis
found
in
the
record
was
a
statement
of
petitioner's
counsel
made
as
he
was
examining
purcell
which
judge
friendly
quoted
as
follows,
mr.
updike,
“well,
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
mr.
kirby
entrust
the
responsibility
to
some
extent
of
his
being
a
director
of
alleghany
that
he
entrust
some
of
that
responsibility
to
mr.
young
that
mr.
kirby
cannot
avoid
accepting
the
consequences
of
whatever
mr.
young
may
have
done.”
judge
friendly
stopped
there
but
what
judge
friendly
did
not
quote
was
the
balance
of
the
same
sentence
in
which
mr.
updike
continued
right
on
to
say,
“and
i
do
not
say
that
it
was
mr.
young
and
i
do
not
say
for
a
moment
that
it
was
mr.
purcell
and
i
do
not
know
who
is
responsible.”
the
completed
statement
without
truncation
which
the
only
reference
judge
friendly
could
find
is
a
disclaimer,
and
kirby's
counsel,
we
submit,
was
entitled
to
rely
upon
it
and
on
the
pretrial
statement
of
issues
and
the
pleadings
in
conducting
his
defense
and
in
cross-examining
the
very
witness
on
the
stand,
mr.
purcell.
and
we
submit
that
a
theory
based
on
young
and
purcell's
conduct
is
not
now
open
to
the
petitioners,
that
they're
barred
by
their
pleadings,
their
statement
of
issues,
their
statements
at
trial.
now,
although
petitioners'
brief,
reply
brief
points
to
counsel
statements
in
the
district
court
made
after
trial
on
the
issue
presented
to
the
effect
that
kirby
could
not
escape
responsibility
by
delegating
to
others
the
duty
to
search
out
and
volunteer
records.
not
one
of
these
statements
ever
claims
fraud
on
the
part
of
young
and
purcell.
the
first
time
that
was
claimed
was
on
appeal.
the
next
fact
that
i
think
is
very
significant
is
that
the
attack
here
is
not
upon
some
joint
settlement
made
in
zenn
by
young,
kirby
and
purcell.
it
is
on
kirby's
separate
settlement
approving
what
the
complaint
specifies
in
this
action,
22
times
as
kirby's
“separate
settlement”.
there
was
never
any
issue,
proof
or
finding
of
any
joint
action
between
young,
kirby
and
purcell
in
the
conduct
of
the
zenn
settlement
hearings.
kirby
was
neither
subpoenaed
nor
served
in
the
zenn
action.
the
record
shows
that
he
negotiated
a
separate
settlement,
separately
approved
by
a
separate
judgment
over
the
strenuous
objections
of
the
murchisons
and
the
disapproval
of
the
young
estate.
he
was
not
called,
although
he
was
served
in
zenn
federal,
that
case
was
never
pursued.
it
has
been
dormant
since
the
action
was
begun
and
he
was
not
called
to
testify
there
nor
was
he
called,
subpoenaed
to
produce
any
records
there.
yet
petitioners
in
the
dissent
predicate
their
position
here
entirely
on
the
existence
of
some
kind
of
a
conspiracy
or
joint
action
between
kirby,
young
and
purcell.
next,
there
is
the
fact
that
the
legality
of
the
underlying
1949-1950
exchange,
stock
exchange
transaction
and
of
the
proxy
material
used
to
obtain
its
approval
was
not
an
issue
below.
it
was
expressly
excluded
as
an
issue.
it
has
never
been
tried
except
to
the
extent,
the
zenn
referee
and
the
zenn
court
considered
it
when
they
were
passing
on
the
fairness
of
the
zenn
settlement
and
they
concluded
that
the
transaction
on
the
proxy
material
would
be
upheld
after
a
trial.
the
record
shows
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
in
one
of
a
series
rule
16
pretrial
conferences
said,
and
i
quote,
“what
we
are
not
going
to
try
are
the
merits
of
the
1950
transaction
itself.
the
trial
will
not
go
into
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
1950
transaction
was
a
bad
transaction
or
not.
it
will
not
go
into
the
quest.
it
will
go
into
the
question
of
whether
certain
facts
were
concealed
from
the
court.
is
that
understood
by
everybody?”
to
which
mr.
updike
replied,
“yes.”
and
at
a
later
point,
judge
dawson
said,
“i
am
not
going
into
the
question
of
whether
the
zenn-anzelone
case
was
a
good
case
or
not,
yet
the
petitioners
here
assume
the
illegality
of
the
basic
1949-1950
exchange
as
the
whole
predicate
of
this
appeal
and
they
do
so
on
the
strength
of
an
assumption
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
without
benefit
of
any
issue,
any
trial
or
any
findings.
and
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
making
an
assumption
is
evidenced
by
the
statement
of
the
majority
opinion
at
page
2344
of
the
record
in
which
it
was
said
after
the
assumption
and
i
quote,
“but
the
bona
fides
of
the
1950
stock
exchange
were
not
the
issue
for
determination
by
the
district
court
here.
the
issue
was
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
federal
court
to
nullify
a
settlement
in
a
case
involving
fraud
which
had
been
judicially
approved
in
the
state
court.
next,
there
is
the
fact
that
the
said
action
was
adjudicated
by
the
new
york
supreme
court
and
the
appellate
division
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
as
one
for
common
law
fraud
in
which
section
14
(a)
allegations
were
incidental.
no
attempt
has
been
made
by
the
petitioner's
representatives
there
to
seek
review,
we
submit
that
under
durfee
v.
duke,
they're
bound
and
yet
the
appeal
here,
and
the
questions
presented
here
are
based
entirely
on
the
assumption
that
zenn
was
to
quote
their
brief,
“a
section
14
(a)
action.”
lastly,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
legality
of
the
1949-1950
exchange
transaction
was
neither
alleged
nor
involved
in
the
breswick
suit
in
the
dis
--
federal
district
court
below.
the
one
in
which
the
injunction
was
issued
by
judge
dimock.
breswick
and
zenn
had
other
claims
in
common
which
involved
american
citizens
but
not
the
claim
based
on
the
1949-1950
transaction.
the
breswick
court,
judge
dimock,
never
approved
the
zenn
settlement.
the
--
its
injunction
arose
out
of
other
claims
before
it
not
the
legality
of
the
said
1949-1950
exchange.
yet
the
petitioners
erroneously
in
our
opinion
asserted
here
that
the
alleged
fraud
related
to
a
claim
before
the
federal
district
court
in
breswick.
now,
petitioner's
counsel
here
has
(inaudible)
referred
it
to
the
claim
that
ireland
offered
a
bribe
to
phillips
and
said
that
the
district
court
dismissed
it
finding
that
phillips
had
rejected
it.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
view
of
that
statement
that
the
district
court
had
that
claim
before
it
analyzed
it
thoroughly
and
concluded
on
the
district
court's
own
words
that
the
evidence
was
all
to
the
contrary.
it
found
not
just
any
rejection
but
it
found
that
the
so-called
bribe
was
to
be
part
of
a
settlement
that
would
be
presented
to
the
court
whereby
mr.
phillips'
services
might
be
retained
for
the
--
as
a
representative
of
the
opposition
in
the
corporation
if
the
settlement
went
through
now
and
that
did
not
go
through.
and
the
court
--
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
so
i
think
it's
improper
at
this
point
to
refer
to
any
bribe
which
has
been
thoroughly
passed
over
and
found
unsupported.
reference
has
also
been
made
to
some
statement
made
to
mr.
kirby
about
mr.
young
having
committed
perjury.
i
--
we
have
treated
that
in
our
brief.
i
shall
not
go
into
detail.
i
would
like
to
point
out
just
this.
the
statement
was
a
hear
--
triple
hearsay
statement
made
on
the
basis
of
an
opinion
of
a
non-lawyer
with
respect
to
another
case,
young
against
ebbett
involving
a
matter
that
was
not
an
issue
here,
a
transaction
between
the
murchisons
and
alleghany
for
the
part
of
certain
stock.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
underlying
transaction,
the
stock
exchange
in
this
case.
now,
one
or
two
other
background
facts
i
think
are
important.
the
present
case
relates
to
only
one
out
of
eight
claims
in
the
zenn
suit.
it
started
1954
and
that
charge
that
in
1950,
alleghany's
directors
had
obtained
stockholder
approval
of
the
so-called
1949-1950
exchange
by
concealing
favorable
current
earnings,
current
earnings,
and
by
concealing
earning
prospects
and
the
claim
was
that
the
defendants
could
foresee
that
from
this
evidence
that
the
market
price
of
ids
stock
would
enjoy
the
spectacular
increase
that
began
some
years
later.
at
the
protracted
negotiations
and
pretrial
depositions,
a
settlement
was
proposed
in
1955
in
the
new
york
state
court,
not
the
federal
court.
that
case
lay
dormant
and
has
ever
since
and
it
was
referred
to
a
referee.
the
hearings
before
that
referee
developed
into
a
hotly
contested
proceeding
in
which
22
law
firms
appeared,
some
for,
some
opposed
the
settlement.
4600
of
pages
of
testimony
were
taken
from
18
witnesses,
and
480
exhibits
were
introduced.
the
objections
by
their
own
later
testimony
examined
voluminous
documentary
material
including
28
alleghany
file
drawers
containing
documents
relating
to
ids
and
the
personal
files
of
young
relating
to
ids.
ids
had
its
main
offices
and
its
principal
office
in
minneapolis
and
it
was
then
under
the
control
of
the
murchisons,
not
young,
kirby
or
alleghany
and
the
mass
of
proof
before
that
referee
included
both
optimistic
and
pessimistic
forecasts.
there
was
evidence
that
the
transaction
when
viewed
as
of
the
time
it
was
made
and
without
the
benefit
of
the
hindsight
was
not
unfair
to
the
stockholders
and
that
the
proxy
material
did
not
rep
--
misrepresent
the
facts.
now
time
does
not
permit
analyzing
all
that
evidence
now.
we
have
reviewed
it
in
pages
10
to
22
of
our
brief.
just
one
or
two
facts
i
think
are
significant.
after
the
transaction
was
consummated
back
in
1950,
ids'
earnings
did
rise
sharply
but
after
these,
these
earnings
became
public,
the
market
price
of
ids
stock
remained
close
to
the
same
level
it
had
--
exist
--
it
had
enjoyed
prior
to
that
for
quite
a
long
time.
and
in
july
1950
for
instance,
ids
rose
to
$15
a
share
and
ids'
president
who
had
all
of
the
allegedly
concealed
forecasts
and
projections
required
alleghany
to
fulfill
an
earlier
contract
to
buy
3034
shares
at
$20
a
share,
the
market
then
being
$15.
he
certainly
was
not
impressed
by
the
forecasts.
by
august
of
1951,
one
year
after
the
sharp
earning's
increase
became
public,
ids
stock
had
risen
to
only
$32
a
share.
and
then
but
only
then
it
began
its
meteoric
ascent
to
$200
a
share
in
1954
and
that
was
what
led
to
a
flood
of
stockholders'
actions.
now,
the
referee
submitted
a
125-page
report
and
in
viewing
this
transaction,
weighed
both
the
optimistic
and
the
pessimistic
factors
and
he
noted
that
the
directors
had
it
by
the
stockholders
to
quote
the
phrase
from
the
statement
or
proxy
statement
that
“the
outlook
for
future
earnings
was
unusually
promising”.
that
they
were
dealing
with
hopes
said
the
referee
as
against
reality
and
that
if
more
specific
rosy
predictions
were
made
but
did
not
materialize,
they
would
expose
themselves
to
huge
claims
by
disappointed
stockholders.
now,
why
is
the
proof
claimed
to
have
been
concealed
by
kirby?
on
the
eve
of
trial,
the
petitioner
listed
86
documents,
and
at
trial
--
as
trial
revealed
that
most
of
them
were
already
in
the
zenn
record,
before
the
referee,
there
were
whittled
down
to
12
and
the
record
shows
that
the
plaintiffs
below,
in
answer
to
interrogatories
stated
that
they
could
not
say
whether
any
of
these
documents
were
seen
or
made
available
to
the
zenn
referee,
the
zenn
parties
and
the
zenn
court.
we
think
that's
a
striking
admission
in
view
of
the
claim
that
they
were
deliberately
concealed
by
mr.
kirby.
petitioners
divided
them
into
four
categories.
the
first
they
called
the
waag
correspondents
and
that
i
think
has
been
dwelled
upon
at
length
by
mr.
updike
here.
that
is
dated
more
than
four
years
after
the
transaction
under
attack
in
zenn.
a
proof
of
the
record
shows
that
kirby
was
not
a
party
to
that
correspondence.
he
never
knew
about
it.
he
never
had
it.
some
of
it
was
before
the
referee
but
not
the
copies
that
were
part
of
what
was
later
turned
--
produced
in
evidence
in
this
proceeding
but
duplicates.
in
other
words,
there
were
several
copies
of
this
around
and
two
copies
are
part
of
it.
not
the
same
strikes
as
the
one
they
introduced
here
were
put
in
the
evidence.
there's
no
basis
for
any
charge
that
kirby
concealed
it.
as
for
the
second
category,
the
so-called
ids
projections,
those
documents
came
from
the
minneapolis
files
of
ids.
kirby
could
not
have
furnished
them
to
the
zenn
referee
because
he
didn't
have
them
and
he
was
neither
an
officer
nor
a
director
of
ids
and
at
the
time
of
the
zenn
hearings,
it
was
under
the
control
of
the
murchisons.
for
two
weeks,
in
1949,
six
years
before
the
zenn
hearings,
kirby's
office
had
possession
of
one
of
those
documents
which
was
returned.
kirby
did
not
recall
it.
but
it
was
not
a
forecast
of
ids
earnings.
it
was
an
evaluation
of
ids
certificates
and
income
available
for
improvement
of
reserves.
also,
this
document,
this
allegedly
concealed
document,
was
identified
by
author,
by
date
and
quoted
from
in
another
report
before
the
zenn
referee,
the
shipment
report,
exhibit
295
and
referred
to
in
annual
ids,
annual
reports
that
was
before
the
referee.
certainly,
that
doesn't
show
any
concealment
by
kirby.
then
the
third
category
they've
listed
are
the
stybel
reports.
the
claim
there
is
that
kirby
concealed
one
report,
the
second
stybel
report
dated
march
15,
1949,
over
a
year
before
the
stock
exchange
that
is
the
subject
of
attack
on
zenn.
stybel
was
a
cleveland
investment
firm.
that
document
was
in
the
public
files
of
the
sec
which
were
examined
by
mr.
pomerantz
and
his
group
in
the
zenn
stockholders
action.
kirby
testified,
“i
don't
remember
ever
seeing
it
before.”
he
had
no
reason
to
conceal
it
because
it
updated
--
it
was
updated
and
repeatedly
referred
to
by
title
and
date
and
incorporated
by
reference
in
another
report
by
ref
--
before
the
referee,
the
shipment
report
of
april
7,
1949
which
took
at
least
as
favorable
view
of
alleghany's
prospects
as
to
that
report.
lastly,
petitioners'
category
is
the
monthly
reports.
petitioner's
statement
that
kirby
received
these
reports
every
month
which
they
make
in
their
petitioners'
brief
is
incorrect.
the
record
shows
kirby
had
only
one
such
report
in
his
possession
and
that
was
not
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners
here
because
it
postdated
the
transaction
under
attack.
that
is
the
record
as
to
kirby,
if
your
honors
please,
and
we
submit
that
it
shows
a
complete
failure
of
proof
and
the
courts
below
recognized
that.
the
proof
is
equally
clear
that
even
if
the
petitioners'
proposed
special
disclosure
rule
were
adopted,
kirby
did
not
conceal
or
withhold
any
evidence.
now,
turning
to
the
new
claim
made
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
that
young
and
kirby
concealed
evidence,
if
the
rule
against
raising
new
issues
on
appeal
is
to
have
any
meaning,
it
certainly
applies
here.
petitioners
raised
not
just
a
new
legal
theory
but
a
new
issue
of
fact.
if
their
new
claim
had
been
asserted
on
the
district
court,
there
would
have
been
different
interrogatories,
different
depositions,
different
pretrial
statement,
and
different
proof.
we
would
have
certainly
gone
after
young
and
purcell
staff
to
just
--
see
just
what
they
did
have.
we
would
have
gone
after
pomerantz
and
graubard
staff
to
find
out
--
get
all
their
notes
as
to
just
what
they
did
see
from
these
voluminous
files.
kirby
would
have
joined
young
and
purcell
as
third
party
defendants
in
the
action
if
they
committed
fraud
without
his
knowing
it.
we
would
have
offered
additional
evidence
to
confirm
that
the
ids
records
were
passed
over
in
zenn
because
counsel
there
felt
that
they
already
have
sufficient
proof
and
didn't
want
to
invite
defense
proof
that
those
forecasts
without
benefit
of
hindsight
amount
to
nothing
more
than
economic
astrology.
if
kirby
who
had
not
committed
any
fraud
were
told
six
years
ago
when
this
actions
were
commenced
that
zenn
was
going
to
be
resurrected
because
of
alleged
fraud
by
young
and
purcell,
he
would
have
marshaled
all
the
evidence
to
show
that
the
original
exchange
and
proxy
statement
complied
with
the
law.
instead,
he
relied
on
his
zenn
judgment
approving
his
separate
settlement
as
he
had
a
right
to
do.
six
years
later,
much
of
that
proof
has
undoubtedly
evaporated.
it
would
be
manifest
--
be
unfair,
we
submit,
to
ask
him
now
to
try
to
resurrect
it.
therefore,
even
if
we
were
to
assume
arguendo
and
we
say
it's
not
the
fact
that
young
and
purcell
defrauded
the
referee,
it
would
be
unjust
now
to
set
aside
the
zenn
settlement
as
to
kirby
who
was
admittedly
innocent.
now,
if
there
were
proof
of
conspiracy,
agency
or
some
joint
action
in
the
conduct
of
those
zenn
hearings,
our
basis
might
exist
for
holding
kirby
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
young
and
purcell
but
there
is
no
such
proof.
the
claim
below
and
the
undisputed
proof
was
that
kirby
made
a
separate
settlement
opposed
by
young's
estate
and
the
others.
now,
since
young's
conduct
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
it
should
be
unnecessary
to
review
such
literal
record
evidence
as
there
is
on
the
subject
but
when
we
do
review
it,
we
find
that
judge
friendly
was
in
error
when
he
inferred
from
the
1954
waag
correspondents
that
young
probably
concealed
1950
ids
forecast
from
the
zenn
referee
and
let
me
explain
if
i
may
why.
there
was
other
evidence
in
the
zenn
record
not
known
to
the
zenn
--
to
judge
friendly
but
known
to
the
zenn
referee
which
shows
that
judge
friendly
was
wrong
and
that
young
and
purcell
both
made
a
whole
disclosure.
judge
friendly
inferred
that
young
probably
withheld
one
12-page
enclosure
in
that
waag
correspondence
because
two
back
pages
showed
that
back
four
years
earlier,
in
1950,
ids
had
prepared
a
forecast
of
its
1950
earnings
and
that
this
clue
would
have
acquainted
the
zenn
referee
with
the
existence
of
the
forecast
and
led
people
to
go
trotting
on
out
at
minneapolis
to
get
them.
and
judge
friendly's
inference
is
destroyed
by
the
record
of
young's
deposition
before
the
--
in
the
zenn
proceedings
which
was
zenn
exhibit
4,
which
judge
friendly
didn't
see.
and
it
shows,
we
have
attached
it
as
appendix,
appendix
c
to
our
brief.
it
shows
that
in
the
same
march
29,
1955
deposition
where
the
petitioners
claimed
that
young
“sat
mute”.
he
testified
in
detail
to
the
fact
that
ids
in
minneapolis
routinely
prepared
earnings,
forecasts
and
projections
including
a
five-year
projection
prepared
annually
some
of
which
he
received
and
i
quote
his
words,
“from
time
to
time”.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
submit
that
it
is
for
the
reason
that
one
never
gets
to
the
questions
that
are
presented
here
on
this
record
because
they
are
presented
on
the
theory
that
young
--
that
the
evidence
showed
fraud
on
the
part
of
young
and
purcell
and
that
young
--
and
that
kirby
could
be
held
responsible
for
that.
what
i
am
trying
to
show
here
is
that
that
record
fails
to
show
that.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
but
what
we
are
saying
is
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
i
didn't
hear
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
our
view
if
your
honor
pleases
is
that
the
writ
here
was
improvidently
granted
because
the
sole
question
that
could've
been
presented
on
the
record
that
was
before
the
court
was
the
question
of
whether
the
evidence
was
--
or
the
findings
were
clearly
erroneous
and
what
i
am
trying
to
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
three
judges
who
joined
judge
friendly
were
likewise
unaware
of
record
proof
before
the
zenn
referee
showing
that
their
inferences
were
unjustified.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
oh,
we
submit
your
honor
that
one
does
not
have
to
go
very
far
through
it
because
on
the
first
point
raised
that
the
issues,
pleadings
and
everything
else
would
direct
it
solely
to
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
--
the
claim
of
fraud
on
the
part
of
kirby,
that
that
ends
the
case.
there
was
a
complete
failure
of
proof
there.
what
i'm
now
saying
is
that
even
if
you
go
further,
judge
friendly's
inferences
were
incorrect
because
he
didn't
have
all
the
record
performed
for
the
simple
reason
that
that
was
not
an
issue
before
the
district
court.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
what
is
the
status
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
well,
of
course,
we
cannot
--
it's
difficult
to
speculate
mr.
justice
brennan
as
to
just
what
the
intracourt
views
of
all
eight
members
were.
one
may
infer
that
the
four
who
were
for
reversal
joined
judge
friendly
but
one
may
have
had
other
reasons.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
mr.
justice
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
well,
justice
white,
i
think
that
--
i
think
if
i
may
be
so
full
that
the
writ
was
granted
(inaudible)
improvidently
for
the
reason
that
the
questions
here
which
are
--
whether
there
should
be
a
duty
of
disclosure
in
a
section
14
(a)
action
comparable
of
what
would've
been
required
in
disclosure
to
stockholders
in
a
proxy
statement
are
not
presented
by
this
record.
and
that's
what
i
am
arguing,
your
honor.
the
action
was
adjudicated
between
these
parties
not
to
be
a
section
14
(a)
action.
the
proof
shows
that
even
if
you
were
to
adopt
the
proposed
disclosure
standard
urged
by
the
other
side,
kirby
was
not
guilty
of
violating
it
because
the
evidence
was
all
of
the
contrary.
so
i
fail
to
see
how
taking
up
of
the
questions
presented
by
our
review
here
would
make
any
difference
in
the
result.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
well,
i
--
but
the
majority
opinion
did
consider
it
justice
black
and
concluded
that
it
was
cumulative.
the
district
judge
in
excluding
the
evidence
rule
that
it
was
not
tied
in
any
way
to
kirby
on
this
charge
of
fraud
against
kirby
alone
and
that
it
was
cumulative
in
that
--
already
the
referee
had
before
him
evidence
of
the
favorable
prospects
for
ids.
so
that
i
do
not
feel
that
sending
it
back
to
the
district
court
would
make
any
difference
at
all.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
that
they
did
and
i
think
they
disagreed
on
the
facts
because
justice
black,
they
were
unaware
of
certain
things
in
the
zenn
record.
and
the
reason
they
are
unaware
of
those
things
in
the
zenn
record
was
that
the
issue
as
to
the
conduct
of
young
and
purcell
had
never
been
presented
as
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
judge
black
--
justice
black,
this
case
begun
in
1960.
if
we
had
known
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
well,
the
other
argument
it
seems
to
me
is
that
if
we
were
to
allege
--
if
you
were
to
allege
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
young
and
purcell,
we
of
course
would
have
possibly
considered
pleading
over
against
them
in
the
action.
what
it
amounts
to
is
that
on
the
basis
of
bits
and
pieces
and
the
evidence
with
respect
to
a
matter
not
an
issue,
it's
being
suggested
that
we
go
back,
have
a
new
complaint
based
on
a
new
theory,
new
pretrial
issues
and
a
new
trial.
and
i
submit
that
at
this
late
day
that
would
be
very
unfair
to
mr.
kirby.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
well,
we
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
(inaudible)
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
well,
our
position
on
that
justice
black
would
be
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
that
should
not
in
any
event
be
brought
in
the
federal
court
because
what
it
seeks
to
do
is
to
set
aside
a
fraud,
a
state
court
settlement
which
the
state
court
referee
and
that
court
reviewed
the
evidence
at
great
length
and
the
availability
of
a
clear
and
open
remedy
in
the
state
court
in
which
all
the
parties
would
be
before
the
state
court
as
valid
basis
for
dismissing
this
appeal.
under
the
new
york
law
where
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations,
a
litigant,
any
party
may
move
to
reopen
and
set
aside
a
judgment
for
fraud,
for
newly
discovered
evidence
or
for
misconduct
short
of
fraud.
in
that
proceeding,
the
court
would
have
all
the
parties
before
it,
including
young's
estate
and
purcell.
it
could
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
no,
your
honor.
this
is
the
most
startling
part
about
this
case.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
they
seek
--
they
do
not
have
young,
they
do
not
have
purcell.
they
zeroed
in
solely
on
kirby
because
at
the
time
when
the
action
was
commenced,
it
was
simultaneously
with
the
commencement
of
murchison
proxy
by
--
for
control
of
alleghany.
they
seek
only
to
set
aside
the
zenn
judgment
as
to
kirby
only
and
not
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
i
don't
know
whether
they
could've
explained
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
but
your
honor,
at
that
instant,
the
state
court
has
is
this,
it
had
all
the
evidence
before
it.
it
is
in
a
far
better
position
having
lived
with
the
case
to
decide
whether
it
was
defrauded
than
the
federal
court.
the
state
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
--
the
rule
in
new
york
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
that
a
collateral
attack
of
this
sort
should
be
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
the
best
remedy
and
the
utmost
--
most
equitable
and
adequate
remedy
is
on
the
state
court
and
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
which
should
be
pursued
as
it
would
under
state
law
before
the
very
judge,
the
state
court
rules
provided
that
it's
reassigned
to
the
very
judge
who
had
before
him
and
that
he's
in
a
much
better
position
to
decide
whether
he
was
defrauded
after
having
lived
with
the
evidence
in
the
case,
then
a
new
judge
to
whom
it's
exposed
for
the
first
time
and
i
might
also
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
i
don't
think
they
would
because,
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
state
court,
the
zenn
referee
had
before
him
480
exhibits
and
that's
already
in
the
state
court
filed
before
the
judge
who
is
still
serving
and
the
referee,
they're
both
in
service.
they
would
simply
pick
up
where
they
left
off
and
see
whether
or
not
the
evidence
would
have
made
any
difference
to
them.
but
now,
we
would
be
asked
to
go
back
and
i
might
add
parenthetically
that
the
district
judge
before
whom
this
was
tried,
judge
dawson
since
deceased
would
have
to
go
back
and
start
a
trial
all
over
again
before
a
judge
who
never
lived
with
it,
and
would
have
to
second
guess
whether
he
thinks
this
evidence
would
have
made
any
difference
to
it.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
in
my
judgment
your
honor
on
the
proof
that
is
now
--
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
i
think
that
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
collateral
--
to
entertain
a
collateral
attack
upon
a
state
court
judgment
for
--
in
new
york
for
what
is
called
extrinsic
fraud
and
that
the
proof
in
this
record
shows
that
the
fraud
was
not
of
the
type
which
under
new
york
state
law
would
permit
collateral
attack
and
therefore
it
would
be
dismissed
on
the
record
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
on
the
proof?
that's
now
on
the
record,
i
would
say
that
is
correct,
justice
black.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
very
important
piece
of
evidence
which
i
think
has
been
wholly
left
untouched
by
petitioners
and
that
is
the
fact
that
on
february
11,
1950,
the
objectant's
counsel
had
before
him
and
introduced
into
evidence
in
the
zenn
proceedings
a
report
by
mr.
purcell,
one
of
the
defendants
to
young
and
kirby,
the
other
two
defendants,
zenn,
forecasting
$19.61
of
income
per
ids
share,
from
ids'
mortgage
department
alone
for
1950
plus
increased
revenue
from
all
other
departments.
now,
we
submit
that
that
forecast
which
is
at
1186
of
the
record.
certainly,
a
plaintiff,
the
zenn
referee
with
the
essential
facts
as
to
what
was
being
forecast
at
that
time,
the
value
of
forecast
is
a
different
matter.
it's
also
been
--
that
the
witnesses
testified
that
such
forecasts
of
course
have
very
limited
value
in
view
of
the
many
other
pessimistic
factors
that
were
in
existence
in
1949
and
1950
but
were
taken
into
consideration.
now,
it's
also
been
suggested
that
there
was
a
concealment
of
ids
forecasts.
i
pointed
out
that
young
testified
that
he
had
the
--
he
from
time
to
time
received
ids
forecasts.
he
testified
again
in
december
1955
before
the
zenn
referee
and
by
that
time,
it
was
clear
to
everybody
that
purcell
had
taken
back
with
him
from
alleghany
to
ids
in
minneapolis
these
forecasts
that
alleghany
had
received
when
purcell
went
there
to
become
president
in
1953
and
that
he
would
bring
them
back
with
him
when
he
came
to
testify.
and
in
january
of
1956,
he
did
come
to
testify.he
testified
for
a
full
day
and
he
brought
with
him
as
he
testified
and
i
quote,
“an
enormous
briefcase
in
one
hand,
an
enormous
manila
folder
into
my
other
arm
containing
ids
financial
projections
and
records
and
ids
projections.
now,
young
had
no
motive
therefore
to
conceal.
he
knew
that
purcell
was
coming
along
with
the
ids
projections
and
the
record
shows,
this
is
the
zenn
record,
that
purcell
appeared
with
the
id
--
that
when
he
appeared
with
these
records,
they
were
examined
for
only
a
few
minutes,
that's
what
the
record
shows
by
the
zenn
objectant's.
and
that
at
end
of
a
full
days
testimony
of
a
130
transcript
pages,
purcell
announced
to
the
15
lawyers
present
and
this
is
purcell's
testimony,
“this
company,
referring
to
ids,
produces
a
large
number
of
reports,
many
of
which
i
brought
here
today
that
nobody
has
asked
me
about.”
now,
he
was
inviting
everybody
to
interrogate
him
about
the
ids
records
but
the
objectant's
counsel
graubard
shows
not
to
because
he
had
the
purcell
report
between
the
very
principles
involved
that
was
far
more
valuable
to
him
than
anything
else
he
could
possibly
had.
so
he
decided
to
let
--
well
enough
alone
and
we
submit
the
proof
of
--
there's
no
proof
in
this
record
of
fraud
on
the
part
of
young
and
purcell.
now,
there's
some
testimony
that
--
or
statement
here
that
graubard
said
later
that
he
would
have
by
(inaudible)
offered
a
certain
exhibit
in
the
evidence
or
a
certain
forecast.
if
that
record
is
read,
it
shows
that
he
could
not
recall
whether
he
had
seen
this
exhibit
and
he
could
not
recall
when
other
ids
forecast
was
shown
to
him,
whether
he
had
seen
them
because
he
said
he
had
a
team
of
people
going
through
thousands
of
records
and
many
of
which
were
examined
by
others
and
not
by
him.
pomerantz
testified
to
the
same
effect.
he
had
a
team
and
he
test
--
he
examined
part
of
the
records,
mr.
clinger,
an
accountant
examined
part
of
them
and
mr.
haudek
examined
the
--
another.
now,
we
had
analyzed
these
documents
in
detailed
in
our
brief
and
we
submit
that
they
add
nothing.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
yes
justice
black.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
in
--
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
issue
was
never
raised
below
and
we
say
that
it
would
be
unfair
now
to
charge
us
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
did
not
relate
to
an
issue
to
set
aside
the
judgment
below.
but
even
if
there
had
been
an
issue,
as
the
district
court
noted,
the
failure
to
adduce
evidence
in
a
proceeding
before
the
state
court
under
state
law
is
not
ground
for
collateral
attack.
it
is
ground
for
going
back
to
the
judge
and
trying
to
find
out
whether
that
judge
considered
that
the
evidence
would
have
changed
his
mind
and
that's
what
we
say
should
have
been
done
here.
mr.
walter
r.
mansfield
there
is
no
jurisdiction
for
collateral
attack
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
evidence
that
has
since
been
brought
out
in
this
case,
justice
black.
now,
what
we
also
point
out
--
want
to
point
out
is
that
the
whole
--
the
questions
presented
here
are
based
entirely
on
one
fundamental
concept
that
this
is
a
section
14
(a)
action
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
a
section
14
(a)
action,
that
section
14
(a),
the
legislative
history
language
shows,
there
was
never
any
intent
to
relate
to
production
of
proof
by
a
director
in
litigation.
thank
you.
