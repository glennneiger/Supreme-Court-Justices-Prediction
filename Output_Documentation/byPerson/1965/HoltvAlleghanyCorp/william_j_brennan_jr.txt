well,
mr.
updike.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
test
were
--
would
follow
this
change
in
the
result,
what
scope
of
their
review
that
that
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
assuming
the
test
they
applied
was
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
assuming
if
i
may
for
a
moment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
without
intimating
at
all
--
i
mean,
disagreeing
with
you
about
it.
they
did
apply
the
test,
would
probably
change
the
result.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
my
question
is,
when
they
apply
the
judgment
in
this
record
that
it
would
not
probably
change
the
result.
now,
my
question
is,
if
that
were
the
correct
tests,
what
scope
of
our
review
was
that
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
that
--
was
that
--
are
we
then
to
do
--
hold
again
the
job
that
the
court
of
appeals
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
the
question
mr.
updike,
is
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you
on
that
point
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
suppose
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
indeed
apply
the
correct
criteria,
and
my
question
is,
how
far
do
we
review
their
application
of
those
correct
criteria?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
updike,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
frankly
what
is
the
definition
of
the
federal
being
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
mansfield.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
this,
as
if
you
are
arguing
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
merits
(inaudible),
is
that
your
idea
of
what
--
the
way
we
have
to
look
at
this
case
on
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
won
in
the
court
of
appeals,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
what
i
was
wondering.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
with
that
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
limit
of
our
review
of
what
--
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
consequence
of
the
4
to
4
division
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course
what
i'm
getting
at
--
of
course,
i'm
not
anxious
to
do
it,
do
i
have
to
go
all
through
this
thing
in
order
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
had
any
idea,
what's
the
status
of
the
panel
decision
in
light
of
4-4
division
en
banc?
