on
the
--
on
this
branch
of
the
case,
mr.
updike,
on
this
decision
not
to
petition
for
certiorari,
you
don't
claim
any
fraud

in
that

you
said
that
judge
kaufman
to
the
suggestion
in
the
footnote
by
judge
kaufman's
opinion
would
be
available.
how
could
you
prove
damages
if
any
in
that
kind
of
a
primitive
action?
how
could
you

highly
speculating.
justice

what
would
the
remedy
be?
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
anybody
measure
the
amount
of
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no.
because
no,
the
damages
here
would
depend
upon
what
this
court
did,
first
with
respect
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
then
one
can
go
on
and
hypothesize
that
that
would've
been
granted
them
then
with
respect
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
merit
of
the
case.
