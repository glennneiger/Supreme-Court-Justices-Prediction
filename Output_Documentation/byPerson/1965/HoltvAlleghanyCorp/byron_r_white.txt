justice
byron
r.
white
what
volume
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
(inaudible)
this
was
never
disclosed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
no
mention
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
made
available
to
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
did
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
is
--
what
if
the
criteria
were
correct?
and
what
if
the
rules
they
applied
were
really
correct?
and
mr.
justice
brennan
asked,
why
should
we
second
guess
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
this
essentially
questions
of
--
out
of
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
where
--
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
what
the
origin
was
of
the
rule
that
was
applied?
did
it
say
it
was
federal
law
or
state
law
or
was
it
wholly
silent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
what
do
you
--
do
you
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
applying
state
law
rather
than
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
--
aside
from
the
federal
securities
law,
would
you
say
this
would
be
a
federal
question
or
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aside
--
you
say
that
this
is
the
federal
statute,
the
federal
securities
laws
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
make
this
a
federal
question
rather
than
a
state
law
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
federal
standard
of
disclosure
should
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
the
same
standard
for
disclosure
in
the
settled
--
in
the
process
of
settlement
as
it
is
in
the
process
of
buying
the
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but,
well
on
the
sense,
may
i
get
it?
you're
saying
the
court
of
appeals
has
simply
applied
a
wrong
standard
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
this
question,
namely
that
the
--
that
(inaudible)
--
the
question
of
actuality
rather
than
probability.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
say
which
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
say
which
it
was
applying,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
--
what
makes
you
think
the
federal
rule
is
the
rule
you
--
the
federal
rule
is
as
you
announced
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
essentially
the
stockholders
action,
the
original
stockholders
action
is
a
suit
under
14
(a)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
--
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
gives
the
stockholders
the
right
to
private
actions
under
14
(a)?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
14
(a)
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
pomerantz
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
did,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
not
all
of
the
courts
said
--
all
the
courts
apparently
agree
with
you
that
there
was
not
adequate
disclosure.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
original
proxy
material.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
were
--
and
if
they
had
it
--
had
agreed
with
you
that
the
same
standard
applied
before
the
referee
and
in
the
settlement,
do
you
claim
that
there
must
be
a
reversal
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
didn't
even
--
but
you
must
--
you
claim
that
they
didn't
even
apply
the
right
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
apply
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
the
--
why
shouldn't
your
obligation
to
intervene
or
why
shouldn't
the
notice
to
you
that
representation
might
be
inadequate?
why
shouldn't
that
notice
date
from
the
time
kirby
took
over
alleghany
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
instead
of
--
because
you
waited
16
months
after
that,
didn't
you
or
some
period
of
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
was
it
between
the
time
that
kirby
took
over
the
company
again
and
that
there
was
a
decision
not
to
apply
for
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
alleghany
--
and
alleghany
control
board
took
it
to
the
court
of
appeals,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
could
apply
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
kirby
control
board
applied
for
rehearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
after
--
and
after
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
settlement.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hughes.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
of
directors
act
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
authorized
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
did
the
board
articulate
any
change
of
conditions
which
prompted
the
--
not
seeking
cert
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
go
ahead.
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
could
be
independent
and
all
the
words
you
applied
to
them
still
be
quite
wrong,
couldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that's
suppose
--
that's
going
to
measure
a
question
of
inter
--
of
the
right
to
intervene?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
on
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
mansfield,
i
take
it
then
on
this
point,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
standard
the
court
--
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
was
applying.
the
documents
really
wouldn't
make
any
difference
say,
in
any
event
no
matter
what
standards
you
apply,
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
court
disagreed
with
you
on
that?
and
then
--
and
the
question
really
was
whether
they
made
enough
difference
or
not.
what's
your
view
of
the
applicable
rule
to
be
applied
in
a
situation
like
this?
is
it
the
state
law?
did
you
look
at
the
state
law
or
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
this
was
a
14
(a)
suit
originally
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
--
you're
answering
here
on
the
basis
that
is
res
judicata
in
that
respect
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
--
what
if
the
court
--
what
if
--
as
an
original
matter,
was
that
a
14
(a)
suit
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
if
by
some
standard
or
rather
there
was
fraud
and
then
the
case
ought
to
be
set
aside,
it
would
be
set
aside
on
that
point
too,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
right
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
you
go
right
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
--
it
would
be
very
easy
here
to
say
that,
“oh
well,
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
this
record
and
decided
that
these
documents
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
anyway.
that's
the
factual
finding.
we're
not
going
to
go
behind.”
the
trouble
is
that
the
people
who
said
that
are
now
submerged
in
a
4
to
4
split.
i
mean
the
panel
decision
is
no
longer
a
--
the
controlling
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
controlling
the
decision
is
in
4
to
4
split,
an
automatic
affirmance.
and
we
have
to
sit
like
in
a
--
as
a
result
of
that,
we
have
to
sit
as
a
court
of
appeals
here?
i
mean
if
we
does
--
if
we
do,
why
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
we
do
have
a
lot
of
reading
--
