mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed
in
your
own
manner,
mr.
updike.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
your
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
updike,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
updike,
may
i
ask
what
your
answer
is
to
the
footnote
of
judge
kaufman
to
the
fact
that
if
the
applicants
are
aggrieved
by
any
possible
wrongdoing
of
the
board
of
directors
in
deciding
to
terminate
the
litigation,
the
district
court's
denial
of
intervention
does
not
preclude
a
derivative
suit
based
on
such
crimes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you're
almost
finished
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
that's
right.
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
--
do
it
your
own
way
mr.
updike.
chief
justice
earl
warren
okay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
of
fraud
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
--
did
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
allege
fraud?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
at
any
place,
did
you
allege
fraud
as
such?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hughes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
can
share
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
share
your
time
any
way
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
want
with
your
co-counsel.
it
--
this
will
take
two
minutes.
they
were
aware
of
that.
they
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
if
this
court
took
this
case
on
certiorari
and
reversed
that
that
wouldn't
be
the
end
of
this
litigation.
it
would
be
just
another
merry-go-round
for
probably
ten
more
years
because
this
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
retrial.
eventually,
there
would
have
to
be
some
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
you
can
be
sure
that
mr.
kirby
would
fight
this
every
inch
of
the
way.
you
can
be
sure
that
he
tried
to
bring
the
murchisons
back
into
this
litigation.
there's
a
real
chance
that
the
murchisons
would
take
the
position
that
if
this
litigation,
this
settlement
was
fraud
and
should
be
set
aside,
that
they
would
want
to
get
back
a
voting
control
that
they
gave
up
in
connection
with
the
settlement.
so
there
was
a
--
there's
a
grave
risk
that
if
this
ever
goes
back
and
is
ultimately
tried
on
the
merits,
we'll
wind
up
with
nothing
and
these
directors
your
honors
are
simply
fed
up
with
this
litigation.
they
want
this
corporation
to
get
out
of
the
courts
and
those
reasons
singly
and
collectively
prompted
them
to
drop
the
litigation.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mansfield.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
