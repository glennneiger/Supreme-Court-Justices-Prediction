justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask,
if
your
argument
is
based
on
the
theory
that
there
is
fraud
here
and
that
you
do
not
have
to
begin
a
suit
for
fraud,
if
you've
been
--
if
it's
been
concealed
from
you
until
a
reasonable
time
after
the
fact
is
discovered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
were
just
saying
though
that
it
was
timely
in
giving
the
reasons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
was
the
reason
you
were
giving.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
timeliness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
had
been
prejudice
and
you
--
yet
you
charged
that
the
--
you
kept
from
doing
it
earlier
because
of
fraud
and
you
didn't
discover
it
until
then,
what
would
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
were
reading
letters
however
with
the
purpose
of
claiming
if
they
had
told
you
that
they
concealed
from
you
the
facts
which
you
had
known
you
would
apply
due
action,
or
you
would
have
proceeded
quicker,
was
that
right
--
justice
hugo

black

or
wrong?

of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
judge
friendly's
statement,
the
evidence
was
improperly
excluded
and
that
therefore
he
wants
--
what
he
wants
to
do
is
to
send
it
back
and
let
them
consider
the
case,
the
issue
you
talked
about
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
was
improperly
excluded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
seem
to
have
disagreed
4
to
4
on
the
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
all
that's
the
case,
why
isn't
it
reasonable?
but
i'm
not
saying
it
is
that
it
has
to
be
done.
why
is
it
reasonable?
except
the
fact
that
they
disagreed
4
and
4,
they
don't
know
what
the
facts
are
and
the
--
that
is
unless
we
accept
one
side
or
the
other
and
let
them
come
back
and
try
it
out
that
issue
which
you
say
judge
friendly
was
wrong
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
the
delay,
it's
a
good
argument,
but
is
that
the
only
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
consider
the
delay,
wouldn't
it
be
far
more
delaying
to
dismiss
this
on
the
theory
that
they
can
file
a
new
suit
and
start
over
from
the
very
beginning
and
offer
a
great
deal
of
this
evidence
that's
here
and
other
evidence
that
you
could
offer
more.
wouldn't
that
be
the
way
to
delay
it
intermittently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
also
having
doubts
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
also
wondering
about
how
they
could
ever
prove
damages
because
you
couldn't
predict
what
the
courts
would
do
on
the
new
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
not
have
them
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
do
they
not
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
could
--
other
parties
could
be
added
if
the
issue
had
been
denied
then
they
could
file
a
new
suit
because

justice
hugo

following
the
pages
of
evidence
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
--
are
you
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
apart
of
these
thousands
and
thousands
of
pages
of
evidence
have
to
be
reintroduced
in
a
state
court
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
judgment
does
this
--
would
the
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
of
this
suit?does
it
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
where
--
what
--
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
it
should
be
exercised.
does
it
have
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
you
think
it
could
not
--
the
suits
should
not
be
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
there's
no
proof
of
fraud
on
the
part
of
purcell
and
young.
suppose
there
had
been,
suppose
all
eight
had
determined
there
was
fraud,
what
would
be
the
situation
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
amount
as
to
practically
to
say
there's
no
jurisdiction,
doesn't
it,
in
the
federal
courts?
