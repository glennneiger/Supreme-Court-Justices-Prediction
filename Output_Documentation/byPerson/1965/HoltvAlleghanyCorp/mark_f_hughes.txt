mr.
mark
f.
hughes
may
it
please
your
honors.
by
arrangement
between
mr.
mansfield
and
me,
i
shall
take
10
minutes.
i
will
confine
myself
exclusively
to
the
intervention
appeal
and
mr.
mansfield
will
deal
with
the
underlying
appeal.
i'd
like
first
quickly
to
answer
some
questions
that
were
propounded
by
certain
of
your
honors
during
the
argument.
mr.
justice
white,
it
was
16
months
after
mr.
kirby
acquired
voting
control
which
is
a
totally
different
thing
from
domination
of
a
board
when
he
acquired
voting
control,
it
was
16
months
thereafter
when
this
application
to
intervene
was
applied
for.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
there
would
be
a
remedy
against
these
present
directors
who
took
the
action
which
was
to
not
proceed
with
this
litigation
any
further.
there's
been
no
question
that
there
would
be
a
right
of
action
against
them
if
they
were
actuated
either
by
fraud
or
banally
or
subserviently
or
in
any
way
except
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
consciences.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
the
remedy
would
be
to
--
it
would
be
an
action
against
them
for
fraudulently
if
it
was
fraud
or
banally
or
subserviently
permitting
the
expiration
of
the
right
to
apply
to
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
expire.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
well,
i
--
one
of
the
things
i
would
like
to
know
is
how
the
--
the
measure
of
damages
is
going
to
be
measured
in
the
underlying
case
because
if
you
can
measure
it
in
the
underlying
case,
you
can
measure
in
the
action
against
these
directors.
it
would
be
the
same
measure
of
damages.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
well,
what
i
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
if
as
a
result
of
the
--
their
action,
a
right
was
lost
and
it
was
transparently
clear
that
this
court
would
reverse
and
it
was
equally
transparently
clear
thereafter
that
they
were
liable
in
damages.
it
would
be
the
same
measure
of
damages
as
existed
in
the
underlying
litigation.
now,
my
time
is
short
and
i
want
to
move
along.
there
is
this
threshold
question
and
if
we
are
right
on
the
threshold
question,
that's
the
end
of
this
litigation
and
your
honors
are
spared
the
necessity
of
deciding
this
deep
clash
that
you
must
be
aware
of
just
by
reading
these
briefs
as
to
what
the
facts
are
and
what
the
areas
of
dispute
are.
now,
i
say
that
the
record
in
this
case
and
what
we
must
go
upon
is
a
very,
very
clear
record
is
that
after
the
4
to
4
affirmance
here
and
undominated
honest
board
of
directors
met,
took
the
benefit
of
legal
advice,
not
only
from
mr.
updike's
firm
but
from
ours
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
would
not
apply
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
and
that
i
say
that
that
action
was
taken
by
a
group
of
men,
nine
of
them
who
represented
$2
million
shares
of
stock
of
this
corporation
which
is
approximately
20%
of
the
entire
outstanding
voting
shares
and
a
group
who
with
these
fantastic
figures
of
$60
million
have
any
virtue
in
them
at
all
would
have
stood
to
increase
their
equity
by
approximately
$10
million.
now,
it's
that
group
of
men
who
met
and
decided
that
they
would
not
proceed
with
this
litigation
and
what
the
petitioners
are
now
attempting
to
do
is
to
set
their
will
against
that
deliberate
action
of
this
board
of
directors
and
that
we
say
is
something
which
they
may
not
do
as
long
as
it
is
clear
that
this
board
acted
independently
and
did
this
according
to
their
honest
judgment
and
conscious
consciences,
that
is
the
end
of
it
and
the
stockholder
may
not
intervene
for
the
purpose
of
setting
his
or
her
will
against
the
wishes
of
the
directors.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
of
course
the
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
yes,
they
did.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
they
did.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
the
same
people.
in
addition
to
which
mr.
kirby
himself
at
that
time
voted
for
the
rehearing.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
well,
yes,
i
will
come
to
that
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
i'll
come
to
it
now
--
if
you'd
like
me
to.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
the
--
i
do
want
to
stress
that
this
--
that
the
board
was
an
independent
board
and
it's
conceded
that
it
was
an
independent
board.
and
then
i
will
come
to
the
question
but
i'd
like
to
develop
this
in
order.
now,
the
law
is
very
clear
that
management
of
a
corporation
is
in
the
board
of
directors.
that's
been
decided
time
and
again
not
only
by
this
court
but
by
every
court
that's
ever
had
occasion
to
consider
the
matter
and
it's
also
clear
that
that
control
of
the
affairs
of
the
corporation
also
goes
to
the
control
of
litigation
involving
the
corporation
and
we
say
the
leading
case
on
that
is
swanson
against
traer
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
which
discusses
all
the
cases
including
the
cases
in
this
court
and
also
was
the
rule
in
new
york
with
the
cases
on
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief
discuss
it.
now,
i
want
to
stress
independence
here
and
to
stress
the
fact
that
on
this
record,
the
petitioners
concede
the
integrity
of
these
directors.
at
page
79,
they
say
that
as
far
as
adequacy
of
the
board's
decision
is
concerned,
we
don't
question
the
integrity
of
the
men
involved.
well
now,
if
you
don't
question
the
integrity
of
the
men
involved,
you
mean,
you're
certainly
saying
that
they're
honest,
that
they're
not
banal,
that
they're
not
pliant,
that
they're
not
subservient
and
that
they're
acting
according
to
their
own
honest
consciences.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
page
79
of
volume
1
of
the
record
before
you,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
mr.
kirby
had
approximately
40%.i
think
subject
to
correction
but
it
was
not
an
absolute
control.
it
was
less
than
absolute
control.0
now,
there
was
more
to
this
question
of
whether
these
people
were
independent
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that's
highlighted
by
the
footnote
that
appears
in
judge
kaufman's
opinion
at
page
2385
where
he
says
that
the
applicant's
counsel
expressly
refused
to
characterize
the
board
as
dominated
by
the
kirby
group.
now,
that
came
about
in
this
way,
that
as
mr.
updike
was
making
his
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals,
he
started
to
talk
about
the
bruiting
presence
of
mr.
kirby
whereupon
judge
kaufman
said,
“well,
mr.
updike,
are
you
charging
that
mr.
kirby
dominates
this
board
of
directors?”
he
was
invited,
he
was
invited
to
say
that
and
he
expressly
refused
to
say
--
to
characterize
them
as
being
dominated.
so
you
have
a
record
in
the
district
court
before
judge
ryan,
supplemented
by
this
concession
that
these
were
independent
directors.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
of
cou
--
oh,
of
course.
if
--
of
course,
just
as
the
court
could
be
wrong
but
it's
a
question
of
business
judgment
at
that
point,
your
honor.
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
having
brought
to
bear
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
no.
it's
going
to
measure
whether
their
decision
to
drop
this
litigation
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
no.
no,
it's
going
to
measure
whether
their
decision
to
drop
this
litigation
was
taken
in
good
faith
because
if
it
was
taken
in
good
faith,
then
their
representation
of
all
of
the
stockholders
was
adequate.
and
that
is
--
we
submit,
is
the
proper
rule
of
law
because
once
you
have
adequate
representation,
you
can't
have
minority
stockholders
sounding
off
and
doing
whatever
they
choose
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
those
who
are
entrusted
with
the
management
with
the
affairs
of
the
corporation.
now
beyond
all
that,
and
i
want
to
come
to
this
because
your
honor
raised
the
question,
what
actuated
the
--
this
board?
well,
it's
very
simple
what
actuated
them.
they
were
confronted
with
the
fact
that
this
corporation
had
been
in
litigation
between
the
kirby
group
and
this
murchison
group
for
over
ten
years,
that
there
had
been
no
success
from
any
of
that
litigation
except
that
they
had
that
settlement
of
three-and-a-half
--
$3,300,000
in
cash
and
they
had
also
acquired
from
the
murchisons
the
voting
control
of
ids
which
mr.
updike
did
not
referred
to
and
which
has
been
variously
estimated
as
having
a
value
of
$5
million
to
$15
million.
now,
that
they
knew
they
had.
i
see
my
time
is
up
but
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
well,
i
just
--
just
let
me
finish
my
thought.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
now
--
