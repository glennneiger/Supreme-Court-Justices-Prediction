mr.
stuart
n.
updike
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
since
i
have
two
petitions
to
argue
here,
i
would
like
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
court
to
argue
the
basic
case
first,
and
the
intervention
problem
second,
because
i
think
it
will
economize
on
my
time
and
the
court's
time.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
thank
you
sir.
this
action
was
begun
to
set
aside
for
fraud
the
settlement
of
prior
derivative
actions.
the
same
relief
here
is
sought
that
was
demanded
in
those
actions,
that
is
the
return
to
alleghany
corporation
of
stock,
as
we
say,
illegally
taken
from
its
portfolio
or
damages
measured
by
the
value
of
that
stock.
the
prior
actions
were
pending
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
the
new
york
county
supreme
court.
they
claimed
among
other
things
that
the
principal
defendant
here,
allen
kirby
and
three
other
officer,
directors
of
alleghany
corporation,
acquired
48,000
shares
of
a
class
a
stock
of
investors
diversified
services
from
alleghany's
portfolio.
the
stock
was
alleged
in
both
the
state
court
and
the
federal
court
to
have
been
acquired
by
means
of
false
and
misleading
proxy
material
in
violation
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
it
was
successful
in
gaining
shareholder
approval.
the
prior
actions
also
alleged
that
the
same
facts
gave
rise
to
a
common
law
liability.
all
of
these
actions
were
settled
with
judicial
approval
of
the
state
court
in
december
1959.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
in
the
state
court
only,
yes
sir.
for
convenience
and
speed
in
getting
through
fairly
lengthy
facts,
i
would
like
to
divide
my
fact
presentation
into
three-time
groups.
one,
the
period
of
1949-1950,
when
the
self-dealing
transaction
took
place;
two,
the
period
from
1954
through
1957
when
these
litigations
were
proceeding
and
discovery
and
in
the
direction
of
settlement;
and
finally,
1959
when
the
case
was
settled
with
new
york
state
court
approval
following
which
this
action
was
brought.
and
while
this
action
was
pending,
it
was
brought
on
behalf
of
alleghany
by
murchison
brothers
of
dallas,
texas
and
a
man
named
fossland
(ph)
in
chicago
seeking
to
set
aside
these
settlements
on
the
grounds
that
i
have
stated
but
while
this
action
was
pending
and
in
the
course
of
a
proxy
contest,
a
--
the
slate
of
murchison
brothers
succeeded
in
ousting
mr.
kirby's
management
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
certain
of
what
we
call,
the
concealed
material
which
we
think
was
crucial
to
the
determination
of
the
liability
involved
that
is
when
it
was
found.
now,
the
self-dealing
transaction
came
about
like
this.
in
1949,
alleghany
corporation
after
a
good
deal
of
careful
study
and
on
the
recommendation
of
mr.
kirby,
and
mr.
robert
o.
young,
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
alleghany
corporation,
they
acquired
85%
of
the
voting
stock
of
ids.
ids
is
the
investment
advisor
of
the
largest
mutual
fund
complex
in
the
united
states.
and
in
1949-1950
it
was
also
a
highly
leveraged
investment
company
on
its
own.
ids
had
in
addition
to
its
voting
stock,
class
a
stock,
the
only
difference
being
that
the
class
a
stock
had
no
vote.
and
while
control
of
the
voting
stock
was
being
acquired,
authorization
was
given
by
the
board
to
acquire
some
class
a
stock
as
a
long
term
investment
for
alleghany.
in
that
manner,
48,000
shares
were
acquired
at
an
average
cost
to
alleghany
of
$8.15
per
share.
upon
acquiring
control
in
april
of
1949,
alleghany
sent
a
man
named
robert
purcell
who
was
vice-chairman
of
its
board
and
a
securities
analyst
named
shipman
to
ids
and
those
men
found
at
ids
that
there
was
a
regular
year
in,
year
out,
month
in,
month
out
program
of
forecasting
the
income,
forecasting
the
expense
and
finally
forecasting
the
net
earnings
of
the
corporation.
as
a
result
of
those
trips
to
minneapolis
where
ids
had
its
base,
one
of
the
forecast
that
was
found
was
a
five-year
forecast
dealing
with
the
years
1949
through
1953
and
whereas
the
stock
had
earned
a
$1.25
in
1948,
that
was
the
year
before
it,
alleghany
bought
in
the
prognosis
by
ideas
for
its
earnings
was
$4.59
for
1949,
$5.67
for
1950,
almost
$8
a
share
in
1951
and
over
$10
a
share
in
1952.
with
this
information
at
hand,
and
on
the
6th
of
december,
1949,
a
board
of
seven
directors
met,
there
were
10
directors
of
alleghany
but
only
seven
were
present.
and
of
that
seven,
four,
well,
mr.
young,
the
chairman
of
the
board;
mr.
kirby,
the
president;
mr.
purcell,
the
vice-chairman;
and
mr.
anzalone,
the
secretary.
all
four
of
them
of
course
were
directors
and
they
were
needed
for
a
forum
and
they
formed
a
majority
of
the
board
at
the
meeting.
at
the
suggestion
of
mr.
young,
it
was
resolved
that
alleghany
offer
to
the
officer,
directors,
the
opportunity
to
acquire
48,000
shares
of
this
stock
at
the
average
price
to
alleghany
in
exchange
for
turning
in
alleghany
preferred
stock
at
market
value.
after
that
meeting
--
oh,
this
was
made
subject
to
stockholder
approval
at
the
stockholders
annual
meeting
on
may
3rd,
1950.
but
between
the
date
when
this
stock
opportunity
was
voted
and
the
date
of
the
shareholders
meeting,
additional
projections
were
prepared,
additional
projections
came
to
the
attention
of
mr.
purcell,
mr.
shipman
and
as
we
contend
to
mr.
young.
in
some
respects,
we
know
from
the
court
below
that
some
of
them
came
to
mr.
kirby.
those
projections
indicated
that
for
1950
itself,
these
shares
being
offered
to
these
directors
for
$8.15
as
a
whole
purchase
price,
these
shares
were
expected
to
earn
over
$20
per
share
and
that
in
the
five-year
period
of
which
1950
was
the
first
year,
in
no
year
would
be
the
earnings
be
less
than
$13
per
share
and
the
average
earnings
were
almost
$18
per
share.
now
that,
if
the
court
please,
is
the
posture
with
respect
to
the
so-called
inside
information
as
we
charge,
and
of
course,
none
of
these
information
was
ever
disclosed
in
the
proxy
material.
that
is
the
transaction
that
all
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
illegal
because
it
violated
fundamental
principles
against
self-dealing.
they
all
concluded
that
the
proxy
material
was
false
and
it
was
misleading
especially
in
its
omissions.
in
1954,
more
than
20
derivative
actions
were
brought
against
the
insiders
on
alleghany's
behalf.
some
eight
different
cause
of
action
were
alleged
in
the
new
york
cases,
one
of
which
was
one
based
on
this
transaction,
and
that's
the
only
transaction
that
we
bring
before
this
court.
it
was
the
insider's
fraud
as
we
claim
in
achieving
a
settlement
of
those
actions
that
this
case
derives.
ten
of
those
actions
were
instituted
in
new
york
state
and
they
were
consolidated
under
the
caption
zenn
against
anzalone.
ten
parallel
actions
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
likewise
were
consolidated
under
the
same
caption
and
abraham
pomerantz
who
perhaps
is
the
best-known
man
in
the
field
of
derivative
stockholder
litigation
was
named
as
general
counsel
for
all
of
the
plaintiffs
in
both
the
state
court
and
the
federal
court
in
the
consolidated
action.
mr.
kirby
was
a
citizen
of
new
jersey
and
he
was
named
as
a
defendant
but
he
was
not
served
in
the
state
court
action.
the
plaintiffs
here
holds
however,
were
able
to
bring
him
into
the
federal
court
action,
as
we
call
it,
zenn
federal
by
saving
him
extra
territorially
under
the
federal
securities
acts,
he
appeared
in
the
federal
case,
was
represented
there
by
counsel
and
that
case
is
still
pending
in
the
southern
district
court,
not
dismissed.
both
the
complaints
in
the
state
court
and
the
federal
courts
specifically
referred
to
section
14
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
in
alleging
that
they
had
--
that
the
shareholder
vote
had
been
achieved
by
the
use
of
force
and
misleading
proxy
statements.
the
pomerantz
led
group
commenced
discovery
in
zenn
federal
and
as
part
of
that
discovery,
pomerantz
demanded
any
and
all
forecasts
and
projections
of
ids
earnings
prepared
by
or
for
the
use
of
alleghany
or
ids
and
although
those
--
such
projections
did
exist,
and
at
least
three
out
of
the
four
insider
defendants
knew
it,
none
were
produced
among
the
thousands
of
papers.
thousands
of
papers
were
produced
for
mr.
pomerantz's
firm
and
for
the
other
plaintiffs'
lawyers
in
these
cases,
but
none
of
these
were
produced,
and
mr.
pomerantz
so
testified
in
the
court
below.
his
proceeding
--
discovery
proceedings
were
interrupted
by
an
offer
of
settlement
from
the
defendants.
and
unaware
of
the
existence
of
these
projections,
pomerantz
reached
a
settlement
of
this
and
of
other
causes
of
action
for
an
aggregate
sum
of
$700,000.
i
will
deal
more
fully
with
this
in
a
few
moments
but
at
page
1359
of
the
record
is
a
replica
of
a
longhand
letter.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
this
is
in
volume
4
sir,
page
1359.
it's
a
replica
of
the
letter
and
i
draw
attention
to
its
date,
july
27,
1954,
this
is
some
months
after
the
commencement
of
the
derivative
litigation
that
i've
just
referred
to.
it's
a
letter
from
mr.
purcell
to
mr.
robert
young.
and
he
transmits
with
this
letter
in
completion
of
mr.
young's
talking
with
mr.
pomerantz,
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
in
these
shareholder
cases,
he
transmits
to
mr.
young
one
of
the
projections
which
had
it
been
shown
would
have
demonstrated
that
the
stock
would
--
was
believed
in
1950,
in
january
or
february
of
1950,
was
believed
to
be
about
to
earn
$20
a
share
and
that
is
the
subject
--
thank
you
--
that
is
the
subject
of
this
letter
and
i
shall
deal
with
it
more
fully
in
a
few
moments.
although
the
discovery
had
been
conducted
in
zenn
federal,
the
settlement
was
taken
to
the
new
york
state
court
for
submission
and
for
approval.
now,
about
this
time,
a
competing
group
of
alleghany
shareholders
led
by
a
man
named
randolph
phillips
and
a
lawyer
named
graubard
instituted
an
overlapping
derivative
action
in
the
southern
district
which
was
captioned
breswick
against
briggs.
they
obtained
an
order
in
the
breswick
case
which
stayed
the
use
of
the
pomerantz
settlement
by
the
defendants
in
these
pomerantz
--
in
the
zenn
cases.
they
stayed
the
use
of
any
settlement
negotiated
with
pomerantz
with
which
excluded
negotiations
with
the
breswick
plaintiffs
and
their
counsel.
and
judge
dimock
later
was
to
refer
to
that
order,
that
state
order,
as
creating
a
veto
in
the
breswick
plaintiffs
over
the
zenn
settlements.
now,
this
graubard-phillips
group
appeared
in
the
state
court
to
oppose
the
settlement
negotiated
by
pomerantz
and
the
state
court
referred
the
matter
to
a
referee
to
hear
and
report
on
its
fairness.
in
this
posture,
the
state
court
referee
hearings
began
after
the
fairness
of
the
settlement.
the
pomerantz
of
course,
claiming
that
it
was
fair;
graubard
claiming
that
it
was
unfair.
but
both
of
them
were
proceeding
in
ignorance
of
what
we
now
know
to
have
been
extensive
forecast
and
projections
of
income
that
were
available
to
the
insiders.
the
issue
before
the
referee
was
stated
by
him,
thus,
was
there
substance
to
the
shareholder
claim
that
the
upward
surge
of
ids
earnings
was
foreseen
to
or
foreseeable
by
the
insiders.
was
there
substance
to
the
claim
that
the
proxy
material
was
false
and
was
misleading?
now,
mr.
graubard
pursued
these
issues
relentlessly
and
unsuccessfully
over
35
hearing
days
extending
over
some
three
months,
he
repeatedly
reiterated
mr.
pomerantz's
demand
for
forecasts,
for
projections,
for
earnings,
for
financial
records
in
either
of
those
categories
but
he
never
got
to
see
the
projections
that
are
before
this
court
and
in
this
record.
thank
you.
in
volume
3,
at
page
1104
appears
the
five-year
forecast
beginning
in
1949
and
running
through
1953.
i
referred
to
earlier,
this
was
sitting
in
the
files
over
time
and
it
shows
in
1953,
i've
given
the
court
the
other
figures
that
by
1953
these
shares
were
expected
to
earn
over
$12
a
share.
that
by
turning
in
the
same
volume
to
page
1121
--
we
have,
i'm
sorry
to
say
the
reproduction
is
not
very
clear.
but
it
still
can
be
figured
out.
we
have
the
five-year
period
beginning
1950
and
running
through
1954,
and
there
as
the
court
will
see
for
the
year
1950
the
projected
income
is
$7,100,000
which
is
over
$20
a
share
and
almost
$300,000
shares
outstanding.
and
for
the
next
year,
it's
$18
then
$13
and
then
$15
and
then
$18
again.
in
addition
to
these
projections,
the
records
showed
that
actuarial
studies
had
been
made
with
a
view
to
determining
whether
ids
was
going
to
be
able
to
meet
its
obligations
on
time,
studies
of
cash
flow
and
again,
each
one
of
those
actuarial
studies
was
related
to
the
forecast
to
which
i've
just
drawn
the
court's
attention.
in
addition
to
these
great
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
in
addition
to
these
five-year
projections,
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
page
1136
which
is
a
one-year
projection
and
it's
done
my
months.
it's
for
the
year
1950
and
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner
appears
the
date,
april
14,
1950,
that's
three
weeks
before
the
shareholders'
meeting
was
due
to
take
place
and
two
weeks
before
the
supplementary
proxy
material
required
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
was
sent
out.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
never
disclosed
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
no
sir.
i
know
my
adversaries
will
contend,
not
these
were
present
for
that
one
--
an
ingenious
lawyer
might
have
been
able
to
put
together
some
of
these
conclusions
but
i
will
deal
with
that
too
sir,
if
i
may,
in
a
few
moments.
mr.
graubard
testified
below
that
he
had
(inaudible)
--
he
had
seen
all
of
the
alleghany
files.
well
quite
obviously,
what
he
necessarily
meant
was
that
he
believed
he'd
been
given
the
opportunity
to
see
all
of
the
alleghany
files
because
he
couldn't
know
what's
fact,
that
he'd
seen
them
all.
so
when
i
showed
him
these
five-year
projections,
and
he
saw
that
stock
being
bought
at
$8.15
was
due
to
earn
$20,
$18,
$15
over
the
next
ensuing
years,
he
said,
“had
i
seen
anything
like
those
earnings
so
high,
i
would
have
introduced
it
had
i
known.”
now,
it
is
our
claim
that
one
cannot
believe
on
this
record
that
these
documents
were
ever
made
available
to
men
of
the
ability
and
background
of
mr.
pomerantz
and
his
partners,
mr.
graubard
and
his
partners,
there
were
20
sets
of
lawyers
who
went
over
these
papers
to
whom
they
were
made
available.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
and
not
made
available
to
the
judge
or
the
referee.
and
one
of
the
best
proofs
of
this
in
my
judgment
is
that
mr.
graubard
kept
asking
for
these
forecasts
and
not
once
over
a
period
of
several
months,
not
once
did
any
lawyer
representing
the
defendant
say,
“why
mr.
graubard,
we
gave
you
those.
mr.
graubard,
don't
you
remember
that
you
had
those?”
they
never
were
given.
now,
if
the
court
please,
in
addition
to
this
and
i
will
only
touch
it
very
lightly.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
mr.
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
they
--
the
district
court
took
the
view
that
many,
many
papers
had
been
given
as
to
whether
these
particular
ones
had
been
put
before
them.
he
made
no
specific
finding.
now
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
view
that
not
reaching
that
question
that
these
documents
were
not
material
in
the
sense
that
they
would
not
--
applying
the
rule
of
ordering
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
they
would
not
probably
have
changed
the
result
in
the
mind
of
the
referees.
now,
in
our
view,
a
--
an
examination
of
them
clearly
indicates
that
had
these
been
before
the
referee,
he
would
have.
he
couldn't
possibly
have
found
the
way
he
did
which
was
to
approve
the
fairness
of
the
settlement
at
$700,000
but
even
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
we
argue
to
this
court
that
the
proper
test
is
not
the
test
for
ordering
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence
where
probably
would
change
the
result
as
to
usual
tests.
we
urge
here
the
test
that
was
suggested
by
judge
friendly
in
his
dissent,
is
there
any
fair
basis
for
believing
that
these
might
have
changed
the
result
and
by
that
test
of
course
we
fairly
think
that
they
would
have
changed
that
result.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
law
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
the
proper
test
was
applied
because
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
i
think
the
scope
of
your
review
on
the
judgment
is
as
to
whether
their
being
a
federal
cause
of
action,
being
subject
to
the
settlement
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
determine
the
criteria
by
which
that
settlement
shall
be
either
set
aside
for
fraud
or
not
set
aside
for
fraud
and
that
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well,
i
think
that
this
court
can
review
again
the
criteria
that
were
applied
by
the
majority
in
that
case.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well,
they
--
it
--
if
i
get
the
court's
question,
and
perhaps
i
don't
get
it
clearly,
but
this
court
is
sitting
in
review
of
a
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
seek
to
apply
what
i
called
federal
criteria
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
--
to
this
issue.
and
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well,
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
can
conclude
that
this
was
fairly
erroneous
that
it
should
so
rule.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
it
was
wholly
silent.
it
did
not
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
no.
i
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
applying
what
might
be
called
federal
common
law
according
to
which
views
but
not
the
lower
--
the
policy
of
which
has
been
determined
by
this
court
with
reference
to
the
federal
securities
statutes.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law
aside
from
the
federal
question,
unless
one
can
agree
that
there
is
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
--
such
a
thing
as
a
federal
common
law
then
it
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
because
a
federal
cause
of
action
was
the
subject
of
the
settlement
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
where
a
cause
of
action
federal
in
nature
is
being
settled,
the
criteria
for
the
settlement
are
to
be
derived
from
federal
considerations
and
not
based
on
state
considerations.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
in
other
words
what
we
say
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
that's
precisely
our
argument.
that
is
the
disclosure
which
should
have
been
made
to
the
shareholders
in
the
first
instance.
it's
precisely
the
disclosure
that
should
have
been
made
to
the
referee
and
indeed
to
the
federal
court
in
new
york
when
the
federal
court
was
asked
to
lift
its
injunction
and
i
would
ask
if
i
may
to
get
the
court
to
turn
to
that
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
the
state
court
deferred
--
i
mean
the
district
court
deferred
to
the
state
rules.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
that.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
the
district
court
turned
to
the
state
for
its
guidance.
it
went
to
this
--
new
york
state
cases
with
respect
to
the
so-called
in
--
extrinsic-intrinsic
fact
rule
in
determining
whether
or
not
one
could
set
aside
the
judgment
for
fraud.
but
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
--
did
not
do
that.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
no.
it
did
state
--
judge
kaufman
stated
that
principles
of
comity
and
institutional
maintenance
i
think
is
what
he
called
it,
the
idea
of
being
but
one
shouldn't
idly
and
easily
disturb
a
new
york
state
court
judicial
determination.
so
he
--
in
that
sense,
he
vowed
as
a
matter
of
comity
to
the
state
court
but
he
did
not
go
out
and
apply
new
york
state
law
to
the
issues.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well,
the
federal
rule
as
i
announced
it,
i
derived
from
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
in
construing
section
14
(a)
and
in
construing
other
aspects
of
the
federal
securities
act.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
it's
right
in
the
complaint
and
both
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
federal
court.
now,
in
the
state
court,
when
the
matter
came
up
for
settlement,
and
mr.
graubard
and
mr.
phillips
opposed
confirmation
in
part
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
cause
of
action
under
section
14
(a)
but
at
that
point,
the
new
york
state
court
was
asked
to
and
it
did
construe
the
allegations
identifying
14
(a)
in
a
state
case
as
being
a
mere
x
questions
and
could
be
disregarded
in
connection
with
the
approval
of
the
settlement.
but
the
14
(a)
identification
is
clear
in
the
zenn
federal
case
and
that
case
of
course
is
still
pending
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
--
in
the
district
court.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
case
against
borak,
isn't
it?
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
it
held
squarely
that
it
gave
rise
to
a
derivative
right
and
a
private
right
and
the
shareholder.
now,
returning
briefly
to
the
picture
before
the
referee,
the
--
young
and
purcell
testified,
mr.
kirby
did
not.
when
mr.
young
and
mr.
purcell
testified,
they
testified
in
terms
of
what
oblique
future
ideas
had
in
the
spring
of
1950.
they
testified
that
it
was
underwater,
that
it
was
a
dog,
they
used
all
of
the
deprecating
words
that
man
skilled
in
finance
can
used
with
respect
to
a
corporation.
and
all
of
the
time,
as
we
contend,
they
had
in
their
back
pockets
the
information
that
we
say
should
have
been
before
the
referee
and
i
now
return
if
i
may
to
that
letter.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir,
1359.
letter
from
mr.
purcell
to
mr.
young,
“the
enclosed,
dear
(inaudible)
--
the
enclosed
letter
from
mr.
waag.
now,
mr.
waag
is
the
vice
president
and
comptroller
of
ids,
the
man
in
charge
of
its
fiscal
records.
“the
enclosed
letter
to
mr.
waag
with
accompanying
material
is
information
relating
to
1949
versus
1950
income.
that
is
folded
in
line
with
our
talk
following
your
meeting
with
pomerantz.
i
suggest
that
you
note
among
other
things
on
page
2
of
the
income
account
attached
to
the
comments
on
operations
for
december
1950.
that
income
from
operations,
i.e.,
before
taxes
or
capital
transactions
had
been
projected
at
$5,992,000.
that
figure
had
been
projected
at.
that
figure
is
over
$20
a
share.
but
it
turned
out
to
be
$8,600,000
which
is
over
$25
a
share.
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
following
observation
by
mr.
purcell.
this
may
not
be
too
helpful.
now,
this
is
in
contemplation
of
a
talk
between
young
and
the
plaintiff's
counsel.
this
may
not
be
too
helpful
especially
since
the
income
for
the
proceeding
here
was
a
$1.5
million
which
is
a
little
bit
over
$4
a
share.
now,
if
the
court
please,
mr.
waag
had
sent
three
enclosures
in
his
letter
to
mr.
purcell.
mr.
purcell
sends
waag's
letter
and
those
three
enclosures
with
this
longhand
letter
that
i
just
read
to
the
court.
two
of
the
three
enclosures
that
came
from
mr.
waag
to
mr.
purcell
were
innocuous.
they
contained
information
that
was
generally
available
and
those
two
enclosures
were
produced.
they
were
given
to
the
plaintiff's
counsel.
they
were
introduced
in
evidence
before
the
referee.
but
the
piece
of
paper
that
contained
the
projection
of
$5,900,000
never
found
its
way
in
that
case
at
all.
the
state
court
proceeded
to
confirm
the
referee's
report
subject
to
the
state
that
the
breswick
plaintiffs
had.
in
september
22,
1959,
judge
dimock
handed
down
a
decision
in
which
he
declined
to
vacate
the
stay.
he
had
been
asked
to
do
so
in
order
to
pave
the
way
for
the
approval
of
the
state
court
settlement.
he
declined
to
do
so
in
stating
that
the
adequacy
of
the
settlement
in
his
view
had
not
been
completely
probed.
following
that,
the
defendant
ireland
who
had
been
working
for
the
new
york
central
informed
mr.
kirby
that
he
was
going
to
be
called
as
the
first
witness
on
the
new
hearings
that
had
been
ordered
by
judge
dimock.
he
also
told
mr.
kirby
that
mr.
young
had
figured
himself
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
the
settlement
hearings
and
that
this
would
undoubtedly
be
brought
out
on
the
new
hearings.
mr.
kirby
immediately
turned
to
his
lawyers.
they
also
represented
alleghany
incidentally.
he
turned
to
his
lawyers
and
asked
them
for
their
opinion
as
to
his
maximum
outside
liability
if
everything
went
wrong.
and
they
advised
him
that
his
potential
personal
liability
arising
out
of
this
transaction
totaled
$62
million.
now,
spurred
by
that
advice,
mr.
kirby
authorized
the
commencement
of
new
settlement
negotiations
which
he
carried
on
through
mr.
ireland
who
by
this
time
had
become
an
officer
of
alleghany
corporation
and
mr.
ireland
negotiated
with
mr.
phillips
who
was
a
representative
of
the
plaintiff's
counsel.
and
as
a
consequence
of
their
negotiations
before
the
end
of
1959,
a
separate
settlement
from
mr.
kirby
had
been
worked
out
by
his
paying
an
additional
$1,100,000
beyond
the
$125,000
which
was
his
share
of
the
prior
$700,000
figure.
now,
in
connection
with
the
presentation
of
this,
mr.
kirby
retained
new
counsel.
his
former
counsel
were
representing
the
estate
of
robert
r.
young
and
the
robert
r.
young
estate
was
not
settling
so
mr.
kirby
retained
new
counsel.
and
at
the
same
time,
it
developed
--
there
was
a
need
to
have
counsel
for
alleghany
and
at
that
point,
mr.
ireland,
a
lawyer,
became
alleghany's
counsel
in
presenting
this
settlement
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district.
now,
he
is
the
man
who
negotiated
the
settlement
on
behalf
of
mr.
kirby
and
in
that
connection,
the
testimony
below
was
--
there
was
testimony
below
that
mr.
ireland
with
the
approval
of
mr.
kirby
offered
$45,000
a
year
for
10
years
and
a
position
to
mr.
phillips
to
induce
him
to
take
the
settlement
offer.
the
district
judge
however
found
that
mr.
phillips
rejected
the
bribe
offer.
mr.
ireland
representing
alleghany,
the
graubard
plaintiffs
having
now
become
satisfied
with
the
new
offer,
they
will
join
hands
as
judge
friendly
said
at
his
dissent
below
and
went
before
the
court
and
judge
dimock
left
it
to
stay.
they
went
to
the
state
court
and
the
state
court
made
its
settlement
--
its
order
approving
the
settlement
final.
nothing
was
done
then
and
nothing
has
been
done
since
to
remove
zenn
federal
from
the
row
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
and
in
that
connection,
there
may
be
a
technical
problem.
first,
if
the
court
please,
we
think
that
mr.
kirby
would
like
to
have
the
benefits
of
this
settlement
without
accepting
the
responsibilities
for
the
concealments
that
made
it
possible.
now,
i
have
been
charged
as
having
abandoned
any
claim
against
these
defendants
in
the
--
or
at
least
against
mr.
kirby
and
against
young
and
purcell
in
connection
with
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
district
court,
because
i
did
say
i
didn't
know
who
did
it.
i
didn't
know
who
was
responsible
for
these
concealments
but
i
didn't
abandon
the
fact
that
they
were
the
concealments
or
that
mr.
purcell
and
mr.
young
testified
with
respect
to
areas
where
they
obviously
had
to
have
knowledge
such
as
indicated
by
this
letter
and
where
they
--
never
made
the
disclosures.
so
this
was
argued
to
the
district
court,
it
was
argued
in
the
post
trial
brief
to
the
district
court
and
of
course
it
was
argued
in
the
court
below.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
he
had
testified
in
this
case
and
he
said
he
had
never
laid
eyes
on
these
documents
that
i've
--
i
have
identified
to
this
court
as
being
what
we
call
the
crucial
documents.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
the
question
was
not
asked.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
beg
pardon?
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
no,
it
was
received
in
evidence
at
least
--
the
testimony
was
received
by
the
court
but
as
to
whether
he
was
asked
whether
it
would
make
any
difference,
we
have
the
best
testimony
of
all,
it
was
mr.
graubard
who
said,
“had
i
seen
these,
had
i
known
these
ratios,
i
would
have
put
it
in,
had
i
known.”
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
that
question
was
not
asked.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
or
mr.
pomerantz
either.
in
our
view,
these
documents
are
so
shocking
that
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
whether
the
shocking
character
of
it
--
of
them
does
not
in
itself
persuade
that
the
same
result
could
not
have
been
achieved.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
please,
bringing
your
attention
back
to
the
--
just
the
one
year
projection.
yes,
i
have
it
right
here.
it's
at
page
1137
of
the
record.
i
asked
this
court
if
you
had
been
judge
dimock
and
you
were
being
asked
to
lift
a
stay
and
that
after
you
had
made
a
decision
requiring
them
to
go
back
and
have
more
hearings,
and
you
come
in
with
a
new
settlement
--
they
come
in
with
a
new
settlement
proposal
and
you
are
sitting
there
being
asked
to
lift
to
stay
and
somebody
quietly
gave
you
this
exhibit
which
showed
that
in
1950,
it
was
projected
that
this
company
would
earn
$20
a
share.
i'm
sure
that
no
judge
on
this
bench
and
no
lawyer
in
this
courtroom
would
have
allowed
this
case
to
go
through
on
the
basis
that
it
did.
the
earnings
alone
are
three
times
the
purchase
price
of
the
stock.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
no,
the
court
of
appeals
in
my
view
having
found
that
it
was
illegal
and
having
found
that
it
was
false
and
misleading
as
far
as
the
information
was
concerned
the
court
of
appeals
then
went
on
to
say,
“well,
we
don't
think
that
all
of
these
documents
would
really
have
probably
changed
the
result.”
and
in
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
in
my
judgment
into
the
error
of
looking
for
example
at
the
exhibit
that
when
it
was
concealed
when
the
material
from
young's
letter
was
supposed
to
be
put
into
the
case,
the
two
innocuous
exhibits
are
put
in.
the
one
important
one
contained
actual
figures
for
1950.
they
also
contained
the
projection
for
1950.
and
because
actual
figures
for
1950
were
in
the
document,
judge
moore
says,
“well,
this
was
obviously
prepared
after
1950.”
and
in
consequence,
he
bypassed
the
significance
of
the
projection
for
1950.
now,
i
have
urged
the
court
that
this
is
a
case
requiring
disclosure
and
that
the
same
standards
for
disclosure
should
follow
through
litigation
and
follow
through
settlement
because
--
it's
time
for
recess.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
thanks.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
it
should
follow
through
settlement
because
if,
as
the
district
court
held,
a
director
who
was
engaged
in
self-dealing
suddenly
loses
his
obligation
to
make
disclosure
because
a
litigation
has
been
commenced
against
him,
that
we
think
is
an
invitation
to
reward
oneself
by
nondisclosure.
we
think
it's
a
very
serious
loophole
in
the
law
if
that
continues
to
be
the
rule.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
opening
--
in
the
beginning
of
the
recess,
i
was
dealing
with
the
duty
of
disclosure
as
we
conceived
it
to
be
and
indeed
we
think
that
that
is
where
the
court
of
appeals
did
go
wrong
in
holding
as
it
did
that
a
--
as
soon
as
a
self-dealing
director
is
sued
by
a
shareholder,
his
duty
of
disclosure
ceases.
he
becomes
an
ordinary
adversary
in
litigation.
this
is
true
even
where
the
subject
of
the
cause
of
action
is
a
charge
of
a
violation
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
1934
act.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well,
i
would
define
it
with
reference
to
a
self-dealing
transaction.
now,
i
realize
we're
in
a
broad
area
here
where
directors
perhaps
could
be
sending
out
proxy
material
with
respect
to
a
subject
matter
where
later
on
the
charge
instead
of
being
self-dealing
might
be
ways
of
mismanagement
or
some
just
charges
that.
but
where
self-dealing
is
involved,
in
my
judgment
the
disclosure
that
must
be
made
to
the
referee
and
the
courts
is
measured
by
the
amount
of
the
disclosure
that
was
necessarily
to
be
made
under
the
statute
to
--
in
the
first
instance,
when
seeking
the
shareholder
approval
and
that
means
in
this
instance
that
all
of
the
inside
knowledge
that
these
directors
had
with
respect
to
future
earnings
should
have
been
disclosed
or
they
shan't
be
able
to
keep
the
stock
that
they
took.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
that
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
and
i
claim
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
found
the
way
they
did
with
respect
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
i
think
that
also
was
true
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
--
with
respect
to
disclosure.
as
judge
friendly
said
that
when
mr.
kirby
is
dealing
with
his
own
corporation
in
settlement
in
1959,
he's
just
as
much
on
the
opposite
ends
of
a
self-dealing
transaction
as
he
was
in
1949
when
he
helped
to
vote
himself
to
stock.
and
indeed,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
judge
kaufman
agreed
with
judge
friendly
in
the
court
below
with
respect
to
whether
mr.
kirby
can
escape
liability
for
the
return
of
these
shares
by
reason
of
his
not
having
directly
imputed
to
him
the
knowledge
of
the
specific
contents
of
all
of
these
documents
because
judge
kaufman
said
in
terms
of
its
reliability
as
a
fair
and
genuine
adjudication
of
the
adequacy
of
the
settlement.
the
referee's
approval
would
seem
to
stand
on
no
firmer
grounds
merely
because
the
fraud
which
kept
material
documents
from
the
attention
of
the
zenn
plaintiffs
may
not
be
directly
imputed
to
kirby.
judge
friendly
in
handling
this
question
of
disclosure
said,
“when
a
self-dealing
director
seeks
to
extinguish
the
corporation's
claim
against
him,
he
is
dealing
with
the
entity
who's
interest
had
been
entrusted
to
him
just
as
much
as
in
the
earlier
transaction
that
i
see
no
reason
why
their
obligation
of
fair
dealing
and
full
disclosure
to
a
court
passing
on
the
settlement
should
be
one
with
less
than
their
previous
duty
to
disinterested
co-directors
and
to
the
stockholders.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
that
is
in
the
intervention
side
of
my
argument.
and
i
haven't
quite
gotten
there
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well,
the
clerk
had
told
me
that
i
had
16
minutes
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
and
i'm
--
i
will
pass
if
i
may.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
i
will
answer
it
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
one
argument
that
has
been
made
at
great
length
here
and
which
impressed
the
court
below,
is
that
no
director
should
be
under
a
duty
to
ferret
out
information
against
him
and
that
phrase
ferret
out
is
used
over
and
over
again
in
the
district
court's
discussion
as
well
as
in
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
we're
not
confronted
with
that
here
because
mr.
kirby
was
not
served
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
state
court
action
although
he
was
a
proponent
of
the
settlement,
he
wants
to
get
the
benefit
of
that
settlement.
he
wasn't
served.
but
he
was
served
in
the
federal
action.
and
in
the
federal
action
was
where
the
demand
was
made
on
his
attorney
that
called
for
the
production
of
these
documents.
so
the
issue
as
to
mr.
kirby
is
a
not
a
realistic
one.
he
was
required
by
legal
process
to
come
up
with
such
documents
as
he
could
control.
now,
if
i
may,
i
will
turn
to
the
intervention
point.
and
this
as
i
point
out,
the
suit
began
in
september
of
1960.
there
came
a
time,
a
year
and
a
half
later
when
alleghany
itself
took
over
the
litigation.
that
state
of
affairs
continued
through
the
trial
and
a
decision
after
the
dismissal
in
the
district
court
was
taken
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
so
much
of
the
decision
as
was
predicated
on
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint
based
on
this
concealment
charge.
when
we
came
to
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
kirby's
counsel
applied
for
a
day
certain
for
argument,
early
in
december
of
1963
for
the
reason
that
he
had
acquired
by
purchase
control
of
alleghany
corporation
but
that
control
had
not
been
formalized
at
any
shareholders
meeting
and
in
order
to
have
the
posture
as
he
thought
it
correct,
he
said
to
the
court,
we'd
like
to
have
a
day
certain
for
argument
because
on
4th
of
december,
at
a
special
meeting
of
shareholders
at
alleghany,
control
of
alleghany
will
pass
directly
into
the
hands
of
the
plaintiff-appellee,
kirby.
now,
the
case
was
argued.
it
was
decided
about
five
months
later,
2
to
1
with
judge
friendly
dissenting.
at
the
conclusion
of
judge
friendly's
dissent
--
at
the
conclusion
of
judge
friendly's
dissent,
the
last
sentence
reads,
“since
kirby
has
regained
control
of
alleghany
corporation,
i
would
instruct
the
judge
to
make
provision
for
the
continued
prosecution
of
the
action
free
from
any
control
by
the
present
directors.
in
that
posture
of
the
case,
with
mr.
kirby
at
--
by
this
time,
in
fact
in
control,
i
apply
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
instructions
to
me
and
to
my
framers,
officers
of
the
court
in
the
circumstances
they
are
presented.”
while
that
application
for
guidance
was
being
considered,
alleghany
itself
asked
our
views,
we
gave
them,
they
authorized
us
to
make
an
application
for
rehearing
en
banc.
that
rehearing
en
banc
was
granted
4
to
3
and
we
were
authorized
to
proceed
to
rebrief
the
case.
that
was
4
to
3
because
as
this
court
will
recall,
it's
a
nine-judge
court
but
judge
lombard
disqualified
himself
and
judge
clark
had
died
earlier
that
year.
while
the
case
was
being
briefed,
the
person
appointed
judge
anderson
to
fill
the
vacancy
period
by
the
deputy
judge
clark.
the
case
--
the
briefs
were
submitted.
the
court
took
it
under
advisement
on
the
12th
of
january
of
last
year.
the
court
came
down
with
a
4
to
4
split.
at
that
time,
again,
we
were
asked
for
our
views
this
time
to
write
a
letter
to
alleghany.
we
gave
our
views
urging
that
an
application
be
made
to
this
court
for
certiorari.
the
alleghany
in
addition
to
asking
our
views
took
the
views
of
mr.
hughes'
firm
will
be
far
as
to
independent
guidance
and
that
firm
did
not
take
any
position
with
respect
to
the
merits
but
advised
the
directors
that
whether
they
voted
for
or
against
the
authority
to
my
firm,
they
would
not
be
personally
liable.
accordingly,
the
directors
voted
with
mr.
kirby
and
his
sons
i
believe
absenting
themselves
and
one
director
abstaining
and
they
declined
to
authorize
us
to
proceed.
that
was
not
a
publicized
decision
of
the
board
of
directors.
some
two
months
later,
just
shortly
before
our
time
to
do
anything
about
it
would
have
run
out,
the
interveners
here,
mrs.
holt
and
ms.
mcmahon
learned
of
the
development
of
the
refusal
of
the
alleghany
board
to
go
forward
with
an
application
for
certiorari
and
they
authorized
us
three
or
four
days
later
to
bring
this
application.
the
record
shows
that
they
own
an
aggregate
of
about
$60,000
market
value
of
alleghany
stock.
the
district
court
declined
the
application
under
the
rule
and
the
rule
itself
just
set
forth
at
page
3
of
my
brief
says,
“intervention
as
a
right
upon
timely
application
anyone
shall
be
permitted
to
intervene
in
an
action
when
the
representation
of
the
applicant's
interest
by
existing
parties
is
or
maybe
inadequate
and
the
applicant
is
or
maybe
bound
by
a
judgment
in
the
action.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
here
that
had
--
that
had
the
--
excuse
me
--
yes,
okay.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
here
that
had
the
application
of
this
court
not
been
made,
these
intervener's
rights
would
have
been
bound
by
the
result
of
the
case.
that
is
the
resulting
action
from
the
board
of
directors
not
authorizing
the
application.
next,
intervention
of
right
upon
timely
application,
we
think
that
the
application
clearly
was
timely
because
they
took
their
action
within
three
or
four
days
following
their
learning
of
the
non-action,
if
you
will,
by
the
board
of
directors.
we
don't
think
that
timeliness
is
due
to
start
at
the
point
where
mr.
kirby
came
back
into
literal
stockholder
control
or
as
long
as
this
litigation
was
being
pressed
forward,
the
--
these
intervener's
rights
were
being
represented
in
the
litigation.
and
when
the
election
was
made
not
to
go
forward,
their
representation
ceased
so
far
as
the
litigation
is
concerned
and
if
representation
here
means
representation
by
the
board
of
directors,
then
we
submit
that
every
member
of
this
board
of
directors
owed
his
presence
on
that
board
to
the
suffrage
of
the
majority
stockholder
of
alleghany
corporation
and
the
principal
defendant
responsible
if
we're
right
with
respect
to
this
action.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
that
would
--
that's
the
normal
rule
with
respect
to
fraud
but
in
this
instance,
we
don't
have
any
statute
of
limitations
problem
here.
i
don't
believe
because
these
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
no.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
in
--
with
respect
to
the
intervention
sir?
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
was
far
as
timeliness
is
concerned,
in
our
view,
it
is
timely
where
no
intervening
rights
have
been
prejudiced
by
the
passage
of
time
and
whether
we
take
the
time
when
mr.
kirby
came
back
into
control
of
alleghany
or
the
time
when
the
ladies
first
learned
about
it
or
at
the
time
when
the
board
declined
to
take
action
and
none
of
those
intervals
was
there
any
prejudice
to
any
rights
of
alleghany
or
to
the
rights
of
any
litigant
in
that
case,
and
in
that
sense,
the
application
clearly
was
timely.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well,
i
think
that
the
usual
rule
with
respect
to
fraud
is
that
the
time
starts
to
run
when
the
fraud
is
discovered.that
would
certainly
be
the
normal
rule.
now
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
in
what
sense?
we
claim
that
the
failure
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
it
is
our
claim
that
the
failure
to
produce
documentation
when
under
a
duty
to
do
so
is
a
nondisclosure
and
nondisclosure
where
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose
is
one
well-known
form
of
fraud.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
no
we
do
not,
no
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
we
do
not
claim
any
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
board
of
directors
in
acting
as
it
did
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
no,
those
letters
had
they
been
known
would
have
resulted
in
a
different
result
in
the
case
back
in
my
judgment
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
--
the
1954
and
1955.
the
intervention
aspect
of
this
only
arises
because
alleghany
took
over
the
litigation
itself.
having
been
started
derivatively
alleghany
took
over
the
litigation
then
there
came
a
time
when
mr.
kirby
resumed
literal
actual
control
and
at
that
point,
we
say,
when
it's
controlled
by
a
board
of
directors
selected
by,
nominated
by
and
voted
in
by
him,
that
is
a
sufficient
showing
of
lack
of
representation
where
he
is
the
principal
defendant
in
the
action.
that
is
a
sufficient
showing
of
inadequacy
of
representation
to
bring
us
within
the
rule.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
we
alleged
fraud?
not
in
relation
to
the
intervention,
no
sir.
we
alleged
fraud
in
the
main
case,
the
one
that
i
argued
this
morning,
yes
sir,
it's
a
charge
of
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
defendants
as
to
how
they
got
this
stock.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
well
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
about
a
year,
i
would
say,
a
little
more
than
a
year.
he
took
over
control
on
the
4th
of
december
of
1963.
the
case
was
under
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
until
about
may
of
1964.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
he
authorized
the
continuation
of
the
suit.
he
and
the
rest
of
his
directors
authorized
the
continuation
of
the
suit
as
far
as
the
application
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
concerned.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
but
when
that
was
granted,
4
to
3
in
our
favor
is
when
there
was
a
change
of
heart
and
the
--
a
new
judge
having
then
appointed
that
the
actual
final
vote
was
4
to
4
and
that's
where
the
split
took
place.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir
--
no.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
it
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
it
--
and
alleghany
control
board
came
in
two
days,
i
mean
a
kirby
control
board,
came
in
two
days
after
the
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
our
argument.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
they
authorized
us
to
apply
for
rehearing
after
the
board
--
the
court
of
appeals
since
split
2
to
1.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes.
well,
judge
kaufman's
footnote
that
your
honor
asked
about,
conceivably
that
procedure
would
be
available
but
we
have
here
the
principal
defendant,
we
have
here
the
charges.
we
were
only
allowed
by
the
district
court
to
explore
whether
alleghany
had
the
right
to
go
back
and
try
the
original
cause
of
action
on
its
merits.
all
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
were
designed
to
search
out
whether
the
defense
of
res
judicata
or
the
defense
of
using
the
settlement
as
a
bar
could
be
set
aside
so
that
on
a
rediscovering,
there
could
be
a
reevaluation
of
the
liability
of
these
defendants.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
it
would
be
most
difficult
to
do
so
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
--
i
agree.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
most
difficult
to
do
so.
the
true
measure
of
the
damages
here
and
the
true
issue
before
this
court
here
we
think
is
whether
mr.
kirby
and
these
others
on
this
showing
can
keep
that
which
they
took
in
the
circumstances
that
the
record
in
this
case
shows.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
