up

and

justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry
i
am
not
following
you
because
i
thought
you
just
said
that
character
was
not
violated?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
the
position
to
your
adversary
as
of
the
time
that
wallis
filed
his
public
domain
application,
he
took
the
position
that
you
had
no
interest
in
this
lease
because
your
interest
had
terminated
or
your
interest
was
applicable
only
to
the
previous
acquired
lands
application.
i'm
not
suggesting
i
agree
or
disagree
with
that
--
is
that
the
position?
