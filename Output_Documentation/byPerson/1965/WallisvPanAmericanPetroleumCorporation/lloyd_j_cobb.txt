mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
pan
american's
position
in
this
litigation
is
that
federal
law
is
applicable
to
the
facts.
we
say
that
with
great
confidence
that
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
give
opinion
that
the
court
of
appeals
misconceived
the
law
then
we
say
that
under
the
statutory
provisions
of
louisiana,
the
pan
american
is
entitled
to
both
the
ownership
of
this
lease
and
specific
performance
of
the
option
agreement
which
is
before
your
honors.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
we
--
we
say
that
in
the
alternative,
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeal
to
decide
a
crucial
issues
which
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
passed
upon
--
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
--
in
the
state
law.
now,
all
of
pan
american's
rights
are
derivative
from
an
option
agreement
dated
march
the
3rd,
1955.
at
the
outset
--
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
i'm
getting
too,
it's
precise.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
that
is
correct.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
we
think
federal
law
is
applicable
throughout.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
that's
what
i
believe
to
be
the
critical
part
at
least.
at
the
time
this
option
agreement
of
march
3rd,
1955
was
entered
into,
five
acquired
lands
application
were
pending
on
the
so-called
mud
lumps
and
as
the
district
court
found,
the
parties
all
believed
that
this
was
acquired
land
rather
than
public
domain
land.
there
has
never
been
a
final
adjudication
by
any
court
at
any
time
whether
this
specific
land
is
acquired
land
or
public
domain
land.
the
decision
by
virtue
of
which
wallis
obtained
the
list
did
not
go
out
on
a
point
whether
the
land
was
acquired
or
public
domain,
but
it
went
up
on
one
point
and
one
point
alone
which
was
that
wallis
had
a
proper
description
in
his
final
application
as
a
--
and
the
description
in
the
opposing
application
was
improper
and
erroneous.
what
happened
was
this?
for
some
months
after
the
option
agreement
of
march
3rd,
1955
was
executed,
wallis
diligently
prosecuted
those
applied
lands
applications
in
the
department.
then
towards
the
end
of
1955,
wallis
in
some
inapplicable
manner
found
out
that
his
descriptions
were
wrong
and
that
perhaps
this
land
would
be
regarded
as
public
domain
land
rather
than
as
acquired
land.
so
at
that
point,
he
worked
diligently
for
himself
and
for
himself
alone
and
that's
what
the
brief
of
our
adversary
says.
at
that
point,
he
took
the
position
mentally
that
his
obligations
to
pan
american
were
at
an
end
and
then
he
constructed
two
new
leases,
two
new
lease
office,
one
on
the
public
domain
farm
and
one
on
the
acquired
land's
farm.
into
those,
he
put
the
corrected
description
which
the
courts
held
later
to
be
valid
and
which
was
valid
only
because
he
was
able
to
use
the
knowledge
that
he
had
gotten
through
the
prosecution
of
the
applications
in
which
pan
am
admittedly
have
an
interest.
he
filed
the
public
domain
offer
in
his
own
land
on
march
8th,
1956.
he
did
not
file
the
acquired
lands
offer
until
march
27th,
1956.
he
did
not
file
it
in
his
own
name.
he
filed
a
new
acquired
lands
application
in
the
name
of
his
brother-in-law,
tea
melagarden.
now,
the
day
before
filed
that
new
application,
he
filed
a
protest
against
the
pending
morgan
application.
so
that
by
virtue
of
that
maneuver,
he
was
able
to
bring
into
focus
contest
between
the
mor
--pending
morgan
application
which
he
knew
contained
a
defective
description
and
his
own
new
public
domain
application
which
he
knew
had
a
full
proof
description.
as
a
result
of
that
contest,
the
court
held
ultimately
that
wallis
was
entitled
to
prevail
him
because
his
description
was
correct
and
morgan's
description
was
not
correct.
now
what
we
say
is,
the
federal
interest
involved
here
above
everything
else
is
the
protection
of
the
purity,
sanctity
of
all
agencies,
and
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government
wherever
they
are.
wallis
here
used
the
department
of
the
interior
for
the
purpose
of
perpetrating
a
fraud
on
his
option
lease.
now,
no
fraud,
no
wrong
doing
is
attributable
to
the
department
of
the
interior
because
the
department
of
the
interior
did
not
know
at
any
time
that
tea
melagarden
was
the
brother-in-law
of
wallis
and
that
he
held
this
new
applied
lands
application
for
wallis.
the
department
of
the
interior
did
not
know
who
the
real
parties
in
the
interest
were
because
wallis
had
not
filed
anything
with
the
department
of
the
interior
to
indicate
who
had
an
interest
in
any
or
on
these
leases.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
the
lease
was
finally
issued
under
the
public
domain
application
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
wallis
had
filed
his
own
name
in
which
he
now
claims
to
be
his
own.
that
precise
question,
your
honor,
was
before
this
court
in
the
land
mark
case
of
massie
versus
watts
decided
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
1810.
the
facts
are
absolutely
identical
with
the
case
at
bar.
chief
justice
marshall
held
that
where
one
was
employed
go
into
the
land
departments
make
a
location
and
found
out
that
there
was
an
error
and
corrected
that
error
and
filed
a
new
location
for
himself
that
he
couldn't
do
it
that
his
actions
were
fraudulent
and
that
has
been
the
law
of
this
court
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
well,
so
far
as
the
department
of
interior
is
concerned,
the
lease
was
validly
issued.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
the
fraud
was
direct
against,
the
solicitor
general
points
out.
the
fraud
if
it
exist
you
can
say
it
did
was
not
perpetrated
on
the
department
of
interior.
the
fraud
was
perpetrated
on
pan
american
and
depriving
pan
american
of
its
rights
--
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
--
in
that
to
the
office.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
it
is
governed
by
state
law
unless
there
is
a
paramount
federal
interest
and
we
say
paramount
federal
interest
here
is
the
preservation
of
the
purity
of
all
agencies
and
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
it
was.
that
purity
was
not
violated
so
far
as
the
department
itself
was
concerned.
what
wallis
did
technically
in
the
department,
conforms
the
rules
but
that
purity
was
violated
by
wallis
not
disclosing
to
the
department
as
he
should
have
disclosed.
that
the
tea
melagarden
application
filed
in
the
name
of
his
brother-in-law
was
for
his
own
account.
he
should
have
disclosed
it
because
this
is
obvious
but
we
say,
the
option
is
applicable
because
of
the
corrected
–
the
manner
in
which
the
description
was
corrected.
he
should
have
disclosed
to
the
department
that
pan
american
had
an
interest
in
the
public
domain's
application
as
well
as
in
the
acquired
land's
application.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
the
solicitor
general
as
i
read
what
he
says
confirms
our
position.
the
solicitor
general
says,
“the
regulation
goes
on
to
provide
that
any
agreement
with
respect
to
an
interest
in
the
assignment
must
be
disclosed
even
an
oral
interest”
and
i
have
before
me
title
43,
chapter
ii
of
the
code
of
the
federal
regulations
which
requires
the
offer
to
disclose
any
interest
of
any
kind
which
others
may
have
that
in
the
offer.
mr.
lloyd
j.
cobb
that
is
his
position
and
my
answer
to
it
is
that
chief
justice
marshall
in
plain
terms
in
massie
versus
watts
said
that
that
position
is
fraudulent.
that's
our
case
your
honor.
