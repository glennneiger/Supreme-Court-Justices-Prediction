mr.
e.
l.
brunini
mr.
chief
justice,
and
justices.
i
speak
for
the
respondent
mckenna
and
i'll
use
15
minutes
and
mr.
lloyd
cobb
of
new
orleans
will
speak
for
the
respondent
pan
american
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
time.
obviously,
in
15
minutes,
it's
impossible
to
cover
a
case
with
so
many
rampant
cases
as
this
one.
i
can
only
leave
with
you
certain
thoughts
that
i
do
think
are
controlling
in
this
matter
and
which
were
before
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
is
going
to
be
faced
with
a
great
volume
of
litigation
going
out
of
the
drilling
of
oil
and
gas
wells
and
the
issuance
of
leases
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
this
is
--
this
situation
here
can
be
oversimplified
as
a
private
dog
fight
as
it
has
been
referred.
actually,
congress
has
by
its
acts
in
the
submerged
lands
acts
definitely
showed
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
federal
interest.
not
only
has
it
done
that,
but
it
has
gone
further
and
has
set
up
original
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
district
courts
for
the
purpose
of
determining
anything
in
a
way
of
a
claim
or
a
fight
as
to
the
exploration,
production,
development,
transportation
of
oil
and
gas
from
the
submerged
lands
including
the
rights
to
the
property.
so
your
honors
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
avoid
this
full
question
of
will
the
fifth
circuit
be
able
to
avoid
this
full
question
by
saying
this
is
a
private
dog
fight
and
we
are
not
going
to
establish
federal
laws
for
the
purpose
of
this
particular
individual.
the
point
is
that
whether
you
say
so
or
not,
the
courts
will
have
to
meet
that.
the
courts
will
have
to
fashion
it
because
the
volume
of
litigation
is
now
moving
into
the
district
court.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
this
comes
up
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
yes,
sir
your
honor.
this
--
the
submerged
lands
act
--
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
there
were
two
acts.
two
acts
were
passed.
both
in
1953
and
they
both
there
docked
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
the
lease
was
issued
under
the
old
mineral
leasing
act.
yes.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
not
under
the
--
the
provisions
of
leases
for
the
outer
continental
shelf,
submerged
lands
act.
no
sir.
no
one
knows
really
as
yet
where
this
is.
this
lawsuit
involves
a
mud
log.
they
grew
out
of
the
marginal
sea.
and
the
department
of
interior
turns
this
situation
completely
opposite
to
what
is
here
contended.
the
department
of
interior
lays
on
your
desk
a
copy
of
that
opinion.
the
department
of
interior
says
it's
not
a
question
of
the
federal
law
overriding
the
state
law.
it
is
a
question
that
here,
you
have
exclusive
federal
legislative
jurisdiction
and
no
state
real
property
law
can
apply
to
it.
that
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
the
contention
that's
being
made
here
by
the
petitioner.
now,
we
say
to
your
honor,
if
your
honors
will
read
the
department
of
interior's
very
elaborate
opinion.
it
will
show
to
your
honors
that
there
never
was
and
there
is
not
now
any
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
louisiana
in
this
property.
this
property
still
remains
the
property
of
the
united
states.
it's
never
been
conveyed
to
anybody
and
interest
has
been
conveyed
out
of
that
property.
so
we'll
say
to
your
honor,
you're
in
the
same
situation
perhaps
as
this
law
is
being
developed
as
you
have
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
under
the
constitution,
united
states'
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
was
taken
off
the
district
of
columbia.
congress
passed
an
act
and
said
you
shall
follow
the
laws
of
the
state
of
maryland
but
as
the
laws
of
the
state
of
maryland
developed,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
district
of
columbia
has
had
to
evolve
its
own
federal
law
and
it's
doing
that
today
based
in
some
part
of
the
virginia
law
and
in
some
part
on
the
maryland
law.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
as
far
as
i
--
as
i
see
it
your
honor,
it's
not,
so
far
as
the
department
of
interior's
opinion.
it
says
it's
not.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
now
--
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
yes.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
it
--
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
i
would
answer
that
question
yes
but
then
i
would
like
to
your
honor
to
tell
me
out
and
understand
my
explanation
of
it.
now,
my
time
is
--
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
permitted
to
go
forward
at
this
point.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
let
me
answer
the
question
then
in
this
fashion
--
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
--
that
at
this
point,
no
one
has
delineated
the
coastline
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
number
one.
number
two,
the
submerged
lands
act
says
that
you
shall
somewhere
have
the
boundaries,
lands
of
the
state
moved
out
for
a
distance
not
to
exceed
three
miles
and
then
further
out
than
that,
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
authorized
to
extend
those
lands
all
the
way
out.
that
was
12
years
ago
that
they
authorized
it
but
that's
never
been
done.
at
this
moment,
the
coastline
has
never
been
delineated.
now,
where
you
are
in
this
situation,
i
do
not
know
except
this,
that
the
department
of
interior
in
examining
the
development
of
the
creation
of
the
state
of
louisiana
under
the
act
of
congress
shows
that
it
didn't
go
there
into
the
state
of
louisiana
under
that
act,
nor
did
it
go
under
the
swamplands
act
of
1849
and
1850,
nor
did
it
go
on
in
inherent
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
nor
did
it
pass
by
virtue
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
so
it's
still
just
like
the
constitution
provides
as
we
see
it,
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
and
no
state
real
property
law
can
apply.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
justices.
today
is
on
your
desk
a
reproduction
from
the
national
geographic
magazine
just
came
out
yesterday
and
is
offered
solely
as
a
visual
aid
to
the
court,
the
actual
proof
and
the
record
is
in
the
department
of
interior’s
opinion,
but
it
might
be
just
helpful
to
the
court
to
locate
the
area
where
we
are
speaking
about
in
this
case,
the
area
involved.
if
you
look
down
in
the
right
hand
corner
of
the
little
plat,
you
will
see
the
mississippi
river
and
its
various
mouths
and
the
southwest
pass
is
indicated
on
there
and
there's
a
little
black
dot
saying
burrwood.
burrwood
is
where
this
800
acres
is
located.
i'd
like
now
to
return,
if
your
honors
please,
to
a
matter
of
the
department
of
interior's
opinion
because
as
this
record
shows,
it
lies
at
the
very
root
of
this
case.
it
was
subsequently
appealed
to
the
district
court.
now,
the
litigating
part
is
of
course
including
these
parts.
the
district
court
affirmed
the
opinion
of
the
department
of
interior.
it
was
appealed
to
the
circuit
and
ultimately
a
petition
for
writ
was
requested
of
this
court
and
this
court
denied
it.
so,
this
record
is
based
and
this
title,
this
oil
and
gas
lease,
it
was
executed
by
the
department
of
interior
in
favor
of
wallis
was
founded
in
the
bottom
upon
the
department
of
interior's
opinion.
so
that
in
this
litigation,
the
court
below
and
perhaps
this
court
says,
for
the
situation
where
this
matter
has
run
the
gamut
of
litigation.
the
department
of
interior's
opinion
has
been
as
i
see
it
become
final
in
is
binding,
binding
on
the
court
below.
now,
again,
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
these
facts
that
when
the
original
application
was
filed
on
acquired
land's
lease
the
parties
at
that
time
thought
that
it
had
been
acquired
from
a
louisiana
land
owner
and
they
described
it,
very
lengthily
and
filed
an
application
for
it
in
the
name
of
wallis.
mckenna,
who
had
an
interest
in
it,
conformed
with
the
regulations
of
the
department
by
filing
his
notice
that
he
did
have
this
interest
in
this
particular
lease
as
he
was
required
to
do.
now,
then
after
that
it
appeared
that
perhaps
this
was
a
“mud
lump”
filing
which
have
been
created
and
which
was
not
in
the
state
of
louisiana
so
there
have
been
a
filed
for
a
public
domain
lease
and
used
the
same
description,
it's
a
very
complicated
elaborate
description
as
can
be
seen
from
the
department
of
interior's
opinion
that
you
have.
there
it
was
presented
to
the
department
of
interior
problem
is
this
acquired
lands
or
is
it
the
domain
lands
and
to
resolve
that
problem,
he
had
to
undertake
an
exhausted
of
study
of
all
of
the
available
data,
surveys,
and
otherwise,
of
this
year
since
1812.
it
had
had
to
examine
the
problem
of
the
creation
of
the
state
of
louisiana
by
an
act
of
congress
and
to
determine
thereupon
especially
in
the
light
of
this
court's
historic
pad
land's
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
marginal
sea
which
is
rather
particular
mud
island
had
come
from
was
within
the
state
of
louisiana
under
the
purview
of
the
act
of
creation
and
very
carefully
they
examined
that
and
very
carefully
they
detailed
that
in
that
opinion
that
you
have
before
the
act.
it
came
into
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
this
mud
island
was
never
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
now
then,
in
addition
to
that,
the
department
of
interior
very
carefully
examined
all
of
the
other
acts
which
might
conceivably
have
given
to
the
state
of
louisiana
this
property,
this
whole
plans
act
of
1849
and
1850
and
they
concluded
in
this
very
exhaustive
opinion
that
it
did
not.
then
they
took
up
the
matter
of
the
submerged
lands
act
of
may
1953.
now
counsel
opposite
say,
that
we
misconstrue
the
effect
of
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953
and
that
the
department
was
only
instituted
in
what
took
place
a
part
to
it.
but
the
very
clear
statement
under
the
department
of
interior
is
that
it
examines
in
precise
detail
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
submerged
lands
act
of
may
of
1953
and
when
it
reaches
a
filed
summation
of
it
as
it
does
on
page
18,
it
says,
that
none
of
these
lands
passed
by
the
small
plans
act
nor
did
it
pass
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
then
when
it
reaches
these
conclusions,
it
comes
to
this
point
as
it
must
of
necessity
cause
and
as
it
states
on
,as
the
department
of
interior
states
on
page
19,
“since
it
was
held
at
the
united
states
had
the
paramount
prior
order
and
louisiana
did
not
have
title
to
the
marginal
sea,
then
louisiana
must
not
have
had
a
basis
for
legislative
jurisdiction
to
dispose
of
this
[inaudible]
their
resources,
even
though
the
united
states
may
not
have
acted
or
entered
the
appeal.
so
they're
holding
as
it
must
that
this
is
a
matter
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
state
had
no
jurisdiction
but
to
make
it
clear.
if
louisiana
did
not
have
a
necessary
contacts
to
establish
a
sufficient
basis
for
legislative
jurisdiction,
how
could
in
a
state
real
property
law
apply?
the
legislation
and
judicial
decrees
of
a
state
can
only
apply
to
places
and
things
over
which
the
state
has
jurisdiction.
now
with
that
opinion,
having
gone
through
the
--
through
the
gamut
of
the
courts
and
certiorari
denied
by
this
court
that
opinion
before
the
circuit
below
that
court
inevitably
said
that,
how
can
a
statute
of
real
property
of
the
state
of
louisiana
be
made
applicable
to
property
over
which
the
sole
jurisdiction
and
they
use
the
word
sole
jurisdiction,
over
which
sole
jurisdiction
was
proposed
in
the
united
states.
so,
they
declined
to
apply
that
statute.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
your
honor,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion,
i
dare
say
it
does
not
support
as
i'm
concern
hold
anything
with
relation
to
that.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
well,
it
cited
this
opinion,
your
honor,
as
the
basis
for
is
holding
that
this
was
within
the
sole
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it
did
not
quite
reach
the
point
of
saying
that
--
or
deciding
or
discussing
whether
it
was
actually
in
the
state
of
louisiana
or
not
in
its
opinion.
now,
in
the
description
throughout
in
this
matter
and
i'm
sure
the
surveyor
didn't
know
how
to
describe
it,
but
he
references
to
plaquemines
parish
louisiana.
now
that
comes
about
if
i
might
add
to
your
honor
very
quickly,
it
comes
about
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
plaquemines
parish
is
an
expanding
sort
of
situation
as
a
mouth
of
the
mississippi
river
keeps
moving
plaquemines
parish
embraces
all
of
that
area,
so
that
was
a
description.
now,
you'll
find
in
various
parts
in
one
time
or
not
that
people
will
refer
to
it
as
being
within
plaquemines
parish
louisiana
by
virtue
of
this
description,
but
that
was
never
a
final
discussion
if
i
am
permitted
on
this
question
direct
and
i'm
sure
the
court
did
that
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
reason
necessarily
to
get
into
it
because
the
department
of
interior's
opinion
--
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
in
the
trial
court
below?
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
this
opinion
was
made
for
the
record.
the
department
of
interior's
opinion
was
made
a
part
of
the
record.
now
--
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
not
in
that
precise
manner.
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
i
don't
know
of
all
of
our
briefs
are
in
the
record
in
this
court,
your
honor.
there
was,
of
course,
not
all
of
the
entire
record
was
brought
up
in
the
sense
of
the
briefs
that
were
filed,
but
those
briefs
it
will
file
on
behalf
of
mckenna
do
raise
that
question
and
--
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
yes,
and
i
might
add
this
to
your
honor
and
then
my
time
is
up.
i
was
--
i'm
going
to
take
of
the
time.
but
in
the
very
basis
first
prime
point
in
the
mckenna
brief
that
i
could
put
my
finger
on.
we
can
--
we
can
filed
this
with
you
--
with
the
court,
--
mr.
e.
l.
brunini
but
we
do
say
that
these
lands
were
not
in
louisiana,
never
were
in
louisiana
and
or
not
in
that
just
like
put
that
blank
and
we
say
that
you
can't
have
the
jurisdiction
over
to
that
reason
in
the
application
of
the
statute.
