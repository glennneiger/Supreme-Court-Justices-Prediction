mr.
c.
ellis
henican
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
consolidated
below
are
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
review
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
by
a
divided
court,
a
two-to-one
decision
which
reversed
the
decision
of
the
then
district
judge
j.
skelly
wright.
the
basic
question
presented
by
this
review
is
this,
“what
law
shall
control
local
or
overriding
federal
law
as
to
all
issues
in
these
suits
including
the
appropriate
remedy
where
the
suits
involved
only
a
dispute
between
private
individuals
and
the
u.s.
is
not
a
party.
suits
over
the
ownership
of
a
federal
oil
and
gas
lease
acknowledge
by
all
parties
to
have
validly
issued
by
the
united
states
to
petitioner
wallis.”
the
suits
are
based
upon
two
separate
written
contracts
with
wallis
executed
long
prior
to
his
application
for
the
federal
lease
in
question.
however,
these
suits
were
filed
after
the
united
states
had
issued
the
lease
to
wallis.
while
the
question
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court,
that
court
considered
the
question
of
which
law
should
control
and
then
concluded
that
local
law
should
be
applied
to
these
private
contracts.
accordingly,
local
law
was
applied
particularly
the
statute
of
frauds,
and
the
parole
evidence
rule
since
both
plaintiffs
were
trying
to
enlarge
upon
their
written
agreements
by
the
use
of
parole
or
extrinsic
evidence.
judge
wright
ruled
that
this
could
not
be
done
and
he
further
held
that
the
written
agreements
did
not
encompass
the
lease
that
is
in
question
whereupon
he
rejected
the
demands
of
both
respondents.
in
reversing
judge
wright,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeal
held
that
federal
law
should
have
been
applied
and
it
remanded
the
case
for
further
trial
on
all
issues
in
accordance
with
federal
law.
it
did
this
since
it
concluded
that
the
united
states
had
an
interest
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920.
and
that
uniformity
in
a
decision
of
these
matters
is
required.
and
that
while
there
is
no
expressed
applicable
provision
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
nevertheless,
this
is
a
case
where
federal
courts
should
fill
the
antithesis
of
the
act
and
fashion
applicable
federal
law.
in
addition
to
this
basic
question,
the
further
specific
question
is
immediately
presented
and
that
is
that
since
section
32
of
the
act
of
1920
grants
to
the
secretary
of
interior
administrative
and
regulatory
powers
and
the
further
authority
to
do
any
and
all
things
necessary
to
carry
out
and
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
act,
how
then
is
any
interstitial
authority
vested
in
the
courts
in
view
of
this
all
inclusive
grant
of
authority
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
after
this
case
was
decided
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
writs
were
granted
to
wallis,
this
court
decided
the
yazell
case
which
in
our
opinion
is
decisive
of
this
case.
in
the
yazell
case,
your
honors
noted
that
there
were
no
decisions
by
this
court
in
which
federal
law
had
been
fashioned
to
override
state
law
with
respect
to
issues
arising
from
a
negotiated
contract
particularly
the
issue
of
competency
vel
non
to
contract.
here,
in
the
wallis
cases,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
are
competent
contracts.
having
reached
this
conclusion,
your
honors
specifically
examined
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
some
federal
interest
which
might
require
you
to
give
to
the
united
states
the
advantage
that
it
would
have
had
if
the
texas
law
of
coverture
have
not
been
applied.
strangely
enough,
we
find
that
your
honors
discovered
the
existence
of
at
least
one
federal
interest
in
the
yazell
case
but
nevertheless,
your
honors
refused
to
allow
the
united
states
to
protect
its
federal
interest
at
all
costs
when
the
right
which
the
united
states
sought
to
assert
was
“not
provided
by
statute
or
specific
agency
regulation.”
your
honors,
therefore,
stated
that
you
would
not
in
the
absence
of
specific
congressional
action
override
the
texas
law
of
coverture
merely
to
protect
a
federal
interest
that
was
admittedly
present
and
your
honors
concluded
by
saying
that
the
state
interests
that
were
involved
in
yazell
should
be
overwritten
by
the
federal
courts
only
where
clear
and
substantial
interest
of
the
national
government
which
cannot
be
served
consistently
with
respect
to
such
state
interests
will
suffer
major
damage
if
the
state
law
is
applied.
now,
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
a
federal
interest
in
yazell,
your
honors
did
not
find
that
by
following
the
texas
law,
there
would
result
major
damage
to
a
clear
and
substantial
federal
interest.
consequently,
this
court
refused
to
override
the
texas
law,
even
though
in
that
case,
the
united
states
government
was
directly
involved.
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
not
demonstrated
where
the
application
of
state
law
will
affect
a
clear
and
substantial
federal
interest
nor
have
they
shown
that
such
clear
and
substantial
federal
interest
will
suffer
major
damage
by
applying
local
law.
not
only
did
the
respondents
have
failed
to
demonstrate
these
vital
things,
but
we
submit
that
the
circuit
court
likewise
failed
to
do
so.
the
circuit
court
apparently
used
the
generalities
of
the
paramountcy
of
the
federal
interest
doctrine
which
your
honors
said
in
yazell
do
not
lead
inevitably
to
the
application
of
federal
law
and
you
said
this
even
where
the
united
states
was
a
party.
now,
we
say
to
you
that
there
is
not
only
an
absence
of
the
clear
and
substantial
federal
interest
in
these
cases,
but
that
there
is
actually
no
federal
interest
in
these
cases.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
solicitor
general
was
invited
to
express
the
views
of
united
states
with
respect
to
the
matters
under
review.
the
honorable
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
memorandum.
in
no
uncertain
terms,
the
solicitor
general
has
represented
to
your
honors
that
the
united
states
has
no
interest
to
be
protected
in
these
cases
for
in
his
concluding
remarks
in
his
memorandum,
the
solicitor
general
states,
and
i
quote,
“here,
however,
louisiana
law
is
being
applied
to
determine
not
rights
against
the
secretary
but
only
rights
as
between
private
parties.
in
these
circumstances,”
says
the
solicitor
general,
“no
federal
interest
appears
to
be
impaired
by
deferring
to
state
law.”
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
well
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
consider
that
the
united
states
has
an
interest
even
on
that
ground.
but
on
that
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
but
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
there's
no
oral
agreement.
this
is
the
point
that
has
to
be
decided
under
the
state
law
under
all
of
the
authorities
that
we
cited.
there
were
two
written
agreements.
the
court
has
held
that
those
two
written
agreements
did
not
encompass
the
lease
in
question,
that
neither
one
did.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge
wright
went
even
beyond
that
and
i
would
like
to
call
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
sir?
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
no
sir.
he
said
two
things.
what
he
said
was
first,
that
the
statute
of
frauds
and
the
parole
evidence
rule
of
louisiana
applied
to
these
contracts
which
had
to
do
with
the
transferring
of
a
lease
that
covered
land
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
but
--
and
therefore,
the
contracts
did
not
cover
the
lease.
but
he
went
beyond
that
because
he
permitted
a
full
rest
trial
in
which
all
oral
and
all
extrinsic
evidence
was
permitted
to
be
heard
by
the
court
and
was
heard
by
the
court
and
if
you
will
look
at
page
57
of
the
red
reply
brief,
i
would
like
to
read
what
judge
wright
said
with
respect
to
that
very
point.
he
said,
“with
scant
excuse,
the
court
permitted
parole
evidence
to
show
the
true
intent
of
the
contracting
parties
on
the
date
the
agreements
were
executed
but
not
surprisingly,
the
documents
and
testimony
produced
only
confirmed
the
indication
of
the
written
instruments
that
on
january
3
and
march
3,
1955,
those
were
the
two
contractual
dates
of
it.
no
one
contemplated
issuance
of
a
lease
to
wallis
except
in
pursuance
of
the
then
pending
acquired
lands
applications.
that
was
all
they
talked
about
and
quite
naturally,
that
is
all
they
put
into
their
agreements.
doubtless,
mckenna
and
pan
american
were
both
anxious
to
share
any
lease
wallis
might
obtain
over
their
lands.
at
the
time,
however,
they
saw
only
one
means
of
achieving
that
end.
had
they
anticipated
the
ultimate
issuance
of
a
public
domain
lease,
perhaps,
they
would
have
purchased
an
interest
in
that
contingency
too
but
that
is
a
futile
speculation.
obviously,
they
cannot
be
said
to
have
intended
to
buy
a
share
in
a
future
they
did
not
even
advert
to.
the
conclusion
must
be
that
the
written
agreements
faithfully
recall
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
parties.
so
judge
wright
did
examine
all
of
the
oral
and
extrinsic
evidence
as
you
will
see
from
the
--
a
quotation
from
his
opinion
which
i
have
just
read
to
the
court.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
no
sir,
because
it
couldn't
affect
the
united
states
in
any
way.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
well,
the
solicitor
general
didn't
think
that
the
united
states
had
an
interest.
when
the
parties
finished
their
litigation
before
the
state
court,
then
the
solicitor
general
believed
that
they
have
the
information
that
there
has
been
an
assignment
or
he
will
have
the
information
that
has
not
been
--
that
there
has
been
no
assignment.
and
that's
the
very
purpose
of
this
litigation
as
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
assignment.
wallis
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
he
did
say
that
there
was
definitely
no
interest
that
the
united
states
had
in
this
litigation
and
he
said
it
many
times
in
his
opinion.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
no
sir.
that
is
not
what
he
said
on
the
contrary.
this
has
been
not
what
the
uniform
interpretation
has
been
of
the
solicitor
general.
the
solicitor
--
the
land
department
and
the
secretary
have
consistently
taken
the
position
that
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
a
federal
lease
has
been
transferred
after
the
lease
has
been
issued
out
of
the
government
that
the
land
office
and
the
secretary
have
no
interest
on
the
manner.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
yes,
sir
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
it
might
be
good
anywhere
but
he
has
no
interest
in
it
because
sooner
or
later
the
parties
have
to
come
back
to
the
secretary
and
whether
--
and
if
the
matter
has
been
transferred
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
secretary
and
of
the
land
department,
it
is
at
that
point
that
the
federal
interest
arises.
but
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
parties
have
properly
traffic
in
federal
leases,
the
matter
is
consistently
recognized
as
a
state
matter
and
this
has
been
the
party.
this
is
not
the
federal
law.
this
is
the
secretary
has
taken
a
completely
hands-off
attitude
about
these
matters
and
have
--
has
always
relegated
the
parties
to
the
state
law
and
to
the
state
forum
and
there
are
--
this
is
--
this
has
been
the
uniform
interpretation
that
the
secretary
has
given
to
that
statute
and
to
this
particular
subject
for
over
40
years.
and
there
are
no
decisions
in
the
department
to
the
contract.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
i
would
think
so.
i
would
certainly
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
and
i
think
the
decisions
are
uniformed
on
that
subject
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
has
further
represented
as
the
views
of
the
united
states
of
certain
additional
points
which
we
consider
to
be
pertinent
to
the
issue
under
consideration.
the
first
is
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
mineral
lease
on
acquired
lands
and
one
on
public
domain
lands
and
that
where
an
application
is
filed
for
a
lease
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
for
acquired
lands,
it
is
impossible
for
the
secretary
to
issue
a
lease
on
public
domain
lands
which
are
covered
by
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920.
he
also
pointed
out
that
neither
of
the
parties
in
litigation
claims
that
their
rights
against
wallis
is
founded
upon
any
federal
statute
regulation
order
and
the
validity
of
the
lease
as
issued
by
the
united
states
to
wallis
is
not
an
issue.
and
the
solicitor
general
says
that
this
then
distinguishes
this
case
from
irvine
versus
marshall
which
was
relied
upon
so
heavily
by
mckenna
and
pan
am
and
the
fifth
circuit.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
rights
of
the
litigants
in
these
cases
may
properly
be
left
to
determination
under
principles
of
state
law
unless
the
application
of
such
principles
would
undermine
some
federal
interest
or
policy.
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
general,
this
federal
interest
or
policy
would
necessarily
be
one
drawn
from
the
mineral
leasing
act
itself.
the
solicitor
general
does
not
recognize
any
substantial
danger
of
such
a
conflict
in
these
cases.
while
the
mineral
leasing
act
is
comprehensive
and
vests
the
secretary
with
control
and
supervision
and
gives
him
comprehensive
rule
making
authority
to
implement
the
statutory
provision,
nevertheless,
the
solicitor
general
finds
nothing
in
this
scheme
inconsistent
with
allowing
state
law
to
govern
the
rights
of
the
parties
in
this
private
litigation
and
this
is
founded
upon
the
fact
according
to
the
solicitor
general
that
there
is
no
danger
of
undermining
the
secretary's
regulatory
authority
under
the
act
because
if
wallis
prevails,
the
status
quo
insofar
as
the
secretary
is
concerned
is
unaffected.
on
the
other
hand,
if
mckenna
and/or
pan
am
should
prevail,
they
will
obtain
no
rights
in
the
lease.
wallis
will
obtain
no
rights
in
the
lease
unless
the
assignment
is
approved
by
the
secretary.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
pan
am
and
mckenna
will
obtain
no
rights
in
the
lease
unless
the
assignment
is
recognized
by
the
secretary.
in
emphasizing
the
views
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general,
he
has
pointed
out
what
he
calls
the
critical
distinction
which
is
that
the
application
of
state
law
to
private
agreements
does
not
intrude
upon
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
united
states
but
once
that
private
dispute
is
resolved,
then
the
federal
interest
comes
into
play.
now,
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
that
even
without
yazell,
and
even
without
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general,
nevertheless,
it
is
our
belief
that
the
court
would
find
ample
justification
for
reversal
in
this
case
for
several
important
reasons.
first,
your
honors
will
find
that
even
without
the
guidance
of
the
solicitor
general,
the
secretary
has,
as
i
stated
before
for
over
40
years,
recognized
a
lessee
of
a
mineral
lease
as
the
owner
of
a
property
right.
the
decisions
of
the
land
office
and
there
are
quite
a
number
of
them
have
consistently
held
that
an
oil
and
gas
lease
conveys
an
interest
in
the
land
and
that
such
is
transferable
under
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
land
is
located.
it
is
therefore
been
also
consistently
held
that
when
legal
title
to
a
lease
passes
the
property
like
all
other
property
that
passes
is
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state
where
the
property
is
located.
if
these
holdings
by
the
secretary
are
proper,
and
we
submit
that
they
are,
then
what
this
court
said
in
wilcox
versus
jackson
is
applicable.
the
court
said,
but
that
whenever
according
to
those
laws,
meaning
the
united
states
laws
the
title
shall
have
passed,
then
that
property
like
all
other
property
in
that
state
is
subject
to
the
state
legislation.
consequently,
your
honors
will
find
that
the
land
department
has
regularly
and
without
exception
decline
to
resolve
disputes
between
private
parties
once
the
federal
lease
is
granted
and
has
invariably
referred
the
parties
to
the
court.
but
what
is
even
more
significant
is
that
where
there
is
no
dispute,
and
the
land
department
has
been
required
to
consider
the
law
applicable
to
private
transfers
of
federal
leases,
it
has
uniformly
looked
to
and
applied
local
law.
we
would
like
to
call
the
attention
further
to
the
fact
that
these
interpretations
have
been
a
coming
out
of
the
land
office
and
from
the
secretary
for
40
years,
and
that
congress
has
met
a
dozen
times
since
that
time
and
it
has
not
elected
a
change
of
the
law.
i
notice
that
my
time
is
running,
so
i'm
going
to
abbreviate
some
of
my
argument.
our
second
point,
for
thinking
that
your
honors
would
reverse
in
this
case
notwithstanding
yazell
and
the
solicitor
general
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
court
failed
to
give
due
consideration
to
section
32
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
which
specifically
reserves
to
the
states
all
of
their
rights
insofar
as
a
mineral
lease
is
concerned.
it
says
that
nothing
shall
be
construed
or
held
to
affect
the
rights
of
the
state
or
other
local
authority
to
exercise
any
rights
that
they
may
have.
the
state
of
louisiana
has
a
right
to
a
rule
of
property.
it
has
a
right
to
a
statute
of
frauds
and
to
a
parole
evidence
rule.
and
we
suggest
that
although
this
court
has
never
considered
that
part
of
section
32,
the
court
has
in
the
mid-northern-walker
case
considered
the
rather
all
inclusive
taxing
authority.
and
your
honors
held
in
that
case
as
you
will
find
that
a
state
does
have
a
right
to
tax
a
mineral
lessee
of
a
federal
lease
and
you
recognized
a
rather
sweeping
authority
in
the
state
to
a
sole
tax.
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
to
show
that
congress
has
unlimited
authority
to
dispose
u.s.lands
and
that
it
has
delegated
this
authority
to
the
land
department.
this
then
means
in
our
judgment
that
the
courts
do
not
have
a
duty
to
see
that
the
equitable
title
as
well
as
the
legal
title
to
the
lands
must
be
properly
vested.
we
did
not
cite
in
our
brief
but
we
do
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
sec
versus
chenery
corporation
in
which
your
honors
recognized
the
citation
being
332
u.s.
194
that
the
--
an
agency
can
either
have
a
rule
or
it
can
take
up
these
matters
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
in
this
case,
the
agency
does
not
have
a
rule.
but
it
does
take
these
matters
up
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
and
the
uniform
rulings
which
i
have
mentioned
have
been
done
by
the
secretary
and
the
department
on
a
strictly
ad
hoc
basis.
we
have
pointed
to
the
jurisprudence
interpreting
the
public
land
laws
generally
which
clearly
delineate
the
extent
of
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
in
both
actions
at
law
and
in
equity
and
hold
that
in
order
for
one
to
impose
an
equitable
trust
upon
a
legal
title
issued
by
the
government,
he
must
first
predicate
his
claim
upon
dealings
with
the
land
department
and
then
show
that
under
the
federal
law,
the
land
department
should
have
awarded
legal
title
to
him
instead
to
the
other.
in
these
cases,
it
is
impossible
for
either
pan
am
or
mckenna
to
come
under
those
requirements
because
they
specifically
rely
upon
the
fact
that
the
land
department
issued
this
lease
to
wallis.
they
do
not
claim
that
they
had
a
right
to
get
this
lease
originally
from
the
land
department.
we
see
this
as
a
rule
of
property,
a
rule
of
property
that
has
existed
for
over
40
years,
and
we
feel
that
this
rule
of
property
should
be
confirmed
and
not
be
reversed.
the
fifth
circuit
found
a
federal
interest
because
of
the
assignment
and
the
option.
we
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
completely
overlooked
section
30
(a)
of
the
statute
believing
that
section
30
of
the
statute
had
to
do
with
assignments
and
options.
section
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
section
30
(a)
does
not
even
require
the
reporting
of
options
to
the
secretary.
and
so
we
believe
that
they
had
definitely
not
properly
evaluated
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
we
say
that
what
has
been
said
by
the
solicitor
in
his
memorandum
that
the
court
obviously
did
not
recognize
the
critical
distinction.
and
finally,
we
refer
the
court
to
what
was
said
in
the
radio
station
w.o.w.
versus
johnson,
where
you
said
that
where
there
is
a
possible
conflict,
there
must
be
the
observance
of
fair
accommodation
between
federal
and
state
authority
if
a
reasonable
opportunity
has
afforded
the
protection
of
the
federal
interest.
we
believe
that
it's
clear
from
what
the
solicitor
general
said
on
the
cases
that
this
matter
can
be
decided
under
the
state
law
and
there
will
be
this
reasonable
opportunity
afforded
for
the
federal
protection.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
my
colleagues
told
me
that
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
question
that
was
propounded
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
if
i
may
ask
the
court
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
i'm
happy
to
take
a
moment.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
thank
you,
sir.
yesterday,
mr.
justice
white
referred
to
the
portion
of
the
solicitor
general's
opinion
that
appeared
on
page
16
and
said
it
is
our
view
that
under
this
regulation
an
assignee
may
not
conceal
the
existence
of
an
old
agreement
respecting
an
interest
in
the
assignment
on
the
ground
that
such
an
agreement
is
unenforceable
by
virtue
of
louisiana's
parole
evidence
rule,
this
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
asked.
in
what
i
have
failed
to
point
out
to
the
court
at
that
--
in
answer
to
that
question
appears
on
page
40
of
the
red
brief
that
we
have
filed.
the
regulation
itself,
may
it
please
the
court,
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
that
wallis
secured
his
lease.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is,
that
wallis
did
not
acknowledge
that
he
had
such
an
oral
agreement
under
which
he
was
obligated
to
report
--
to
give
the
lease
to
pan
am.
in
addition,
and
what
is
very,
very
important
as
we
see
it,
and
what
the
solicitor
said
was
that
it
was
the
obligation
of
the
assignee
and
so
it
is
under
the
regulation.
the
regulation
merely
imposes
that
obligation
upon
the
assignee.
pan
am
was
the
assignee.
mckenna
was
the
assignee,
if
you
will.
if
they
are
correct
about
their
agreement
and
therefore
it
was
their
duty
to
report
it
but
there
is
no
duty
under
the
regulation
for
an
assignor
particularly
one
who
does
not
acknowledge
the
existence
of
the
agreement
in
the
first
instance
and
this
is
what
the
solicitor
hadn't
said
with
respect
to
that
situation
where
wallis
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
no,
sir.
he
had
not
already
assigned
that
way
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
no,
sir.
he
had
signed
an
option
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
well,
this
is
not
the
fact
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
--
with
respect
to
the
wallis
case.
you
mean,
if
he
had
previously
at
that
time,
if
it
had
been
a
written
document
under
the
regulation
that
then
existed
he
did
have
an
obligation
to
inform
the
--
the
department.
but
the
department
was
informed
insofar
as
mckenna
was
concerned
and
what
the
solicitor
then
said,
we
emphasize
that
the
secretary
has
not
been
empowered
by
the
congress
to
compel
assignments
or
to
determine
the
rights
of
wallis,
mckenna,
and
pan
am
into
sale.
this
is
when
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
the
act
contains
to
provision
governing
the
private
business
in
this
relation
of
parties
to
oil
and
gas
branches
and
does
not
purport
to
impose
on
oil
and
gas
entrepreneurs,
a
duty
to
deal
fairly
with
their
partners
or
associates.
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
well,
i
--
he
might
just
sit
on
it
but
it
so
happen
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
on
--
on
occasion
it
is
a
practice
but
may
i
make
this
one
other
observation
with
respect
to
mr.
brunini's
charge
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
i
want
to
answer
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
--
the
question
that
the
court
asked,
that
your
honor
asked
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
thank
you
sir.
we've
covered
the
location
of
the
land
in
our
brief
--
mr.
c.
ellis
henican
--
in
many
places.
