justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
united
states
in
the
last
page
of
this
memorandum
says
that,
“it
is
our
view
that
under
this
regulation,
an
assignee
may
not
conceal
the
existence
of
an
oral
agreement
respecting
an
interest
on
the
assignment
on
the
ground
that
such
an
agreement
is
enforceable
by
virtue
of
louisiana's
rule,
evidence
rule.
now,
if
wallis
wants
to
get
a
lease
from
the
united
states,
and
he
applies
for
it
and
conceals
the
fact
that
he
has
made
an
oral
assignment
of
it,
the
united
states
says,
he
may
not
do
this.
it
says
that
an
assignee
may
not
conceal
the
existence
of
the
oral
agreement.
now,
that
to
me
is
not
a
--
it
doesn't
mean
that
united
states
has
no
interest
in
this
matter
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
just
signed
this,
what
i
wrote
--
what
i
read,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
an
assertion
of
an
interest
to
the
united
states
in
an
oral
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it's
enforceable
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes
but
that
wasn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
this
--
didn't
judge
wright
say
that
this
oral
agreement
would
(inaudible)
because
it
was
in
violation
of
louisiana's
parole
evidence
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
--
if
he
had
confined
himself
to
disregarding
this
oral
testimony
based
only
on
the
louisiana
parole
evidence
rule,
if
he
had,
would
you
think
the
united
states
would
have
interest
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
solicitor
general
was
on
this
information
needed
by
the
secretary
to
enable
him
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
cannot
be
withheld
from
the
strength
of
the
state
rule
evidence.
it
seems
to
me,
there's
still
a
big
difference
in
saying
united
states
has
no
interest
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
state
courts
had
found
that
there
have
--
that
there
was
an
oral
agreement,
i
suppose
that
the
secretary
could
cancel
the
lease
because
it
wasn't
disposed.
he
could
cancel
under
bosch
because
of
some
violation
of
the
--
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
did
i
understand
that
that
option
agreement
referred
to
the
specific
applications
that
were
on
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
most
people
would
think
i
suppose
that
if
you
were
signing
an
option
agreement
on
some
leases
on
--
in
mud
lumps
there
they
are
that
you
would
think
that
it
would
apply
any
leases
you
got.
but
it
is
--
it's
really
a
part
of
federal
law
rather
than
the
state
law
which
says
that,
the
application
under
the
one
section
is
absolutely
irrelevant
and
no
good
to
applications
under
the
others,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it's
so
its
federal
law
really
that
enters
under
this
great
deal
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
think
it
is
but
even
the
people
say
it
isn't,
would
agree
that
it's
the
federal
law
would
says,
“this
application
for
one
time
in
the
lease
is
absolutely
no
good
under
the
other
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
a
critical
part
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
really,
really
suggest
under
this
regulation
that
if
a
person
who
is
seeking
the
lease
has
already
signed
half
it
away
that
he
is
under
no
obligation
to
disclose
that
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
but
assume
he
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
assume
that
he
has
signed
half
if
away
at
the
time
he
applies
to
the
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
the
only
--
what
he
does
is
when
there's
a
dispute
he
does
not
issue
the
lease
or
approve
the
assignment.
he
just
sits
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
–
well,
is
that
--
isn't
--
doesn't
have
to
be
the
practice
of
this
--
