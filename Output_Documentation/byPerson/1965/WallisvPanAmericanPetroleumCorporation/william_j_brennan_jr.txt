i
thought
the
solicitor
general
meant
that
there
was
no
interest
on
the
part
of
united
states
in
developing
a
federal
law
independent
of
state
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
may
be
somewhat
different
because
the
state
law
may
differ.
you
may
get
differing
--
you
may
get
50
different
rules
applicable
to
these
mineral
leases.
i
thought
that
what
he
meant
was
that
instead
of
fashioning
a
separate
federal
rule,
we
find
a
federal
law
governing
these
mineral
leases
in
the
state
law
that
that
should
be
uniformed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
be
good
in
louisiana
and
not
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nevertheless
whether
or
not
there
is
an
oral
agreement
enforceable
or
otherwise
is
to
be
determined
by
state
law
at
your
point.
