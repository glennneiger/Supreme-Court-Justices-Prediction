justice
potter
stewart
has
the
as
the
ohio
supreme
court
or
any
–
or
any
court
of
appeals
in
ohio
dealt
with
this
question?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
latest
ohio
bar
you
have
in
your
hand?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
those
in
my
office.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
at
least
as
alleged
by
your
adversary
that
quite
apart
from
griffin
and
the
griffin
rule,
the
automatic
griffin
rule
that
this
case
maybe
an
aggravated
case
in
which
the
prosecutor's
remarks
was
substituted
for
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
subject
as
you
know
of
the
first
appeal
here
which
was
dismissed
and
a
petition
was
denied
but
as
you
also
as
i've
understand
it,
that's
been
reincorporated
now
in
this
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
ohio
law,
this
--
that
this
--
that
in
order
to
be
guilty
of
this
offense
under
ohio
law,
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
more
than
a
single
sale.
justice
potter
stewart
bring
this
out
–-
justice
potter
stewart
that's
under
the
assumption
that
all
will
agree
that
this
case
was
correctly
decided
quite
apart
from
griffin.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
