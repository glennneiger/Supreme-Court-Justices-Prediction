mr.
calvin
w.
prem
chief
justice
warren
and
associate
justices,
i'm
here
in
behalf
of
sheriff
dan
tehan
who
is
the
petitioner,
sheriff
of
hamilton
county,
cincinnati,
ohio.
he
succeeded
or
he
became
a
party
in
this
case
at
the
stage
of
proceedings
when
it
reached
the
habeas
corpus
stage.
prior
to
that,
this
case
which
is
a
criminal
case
involved
the
state
--
people
of
the
state
of
ohio
against
the
defendant,
edgar
i.
shott.
the
only
question
presented
to
this
court
for
decision
is
actually
whether
or
not
this
court's
decision
in
the
griffin
against
california
case
just
this
year,
should
be
applied
retrospectively
or
prospectively.
the
facts
in
the
two
cases
are
almost
identical
except
in
that
they
involve
different
kinds
of
crimes
insofar
as
the
factual
background
of
this
case
might
be
of
some
general
interest
to
the
court
although
the
facts
themselves
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
court's
decision.
i
would
like
to
say
that
--
and
since
this
case
has
had
references
made
to
its
involving
securities
violations,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
actual
crime
involved
was
in
the
nature
of
a
ponzi
deal.
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
securities
manipulation
and
it
involved
a
number
of
persons
other
than
this
defendant
and
when
it
came
to
light
several
persons
were
indicted
each
charged
with
violations
of
the
ohio
securities
act.
in
particular,
this
defendant
was
charged
with
two
counts,
one,
with
selling
securities
without
a
license
and
the
other
in
selling
unregistered
securities.
as
clearly
stated
as
i
can
put
it,
it's
something
like
the
law
that
says
“you
can't
fish
without
a
license
and
if
you
fish
and
don't
have
a
license,
you're
in
violation
of
that
law.
from
that
point
on,
this
trial
was
extremely
brief
although
it
covered
a
period
of
about
three
days.
i
say
extremely
brief
because
there
were
only
two
witnesses
who
were
called
and
at
that
point,
the
state
rested
its
case
and
there
was
no
defense.
there
were
opening
statements
made
by
counsel
on
both
sides
and
in
the
opening
statement
for
the
defendant,
there
were
certain
admissions
made
which
touched
upon
the
requirements
to
be
proved
by
the
state
in
proving
its
case
against
this
defendant.
now
in
presenting
the
issue
to
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
griffin
against
california
decision
should
be
applied
retrospectively,
it
is
my
position,
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
ohio
as
proponents
that
it
not
be
applied
retrospectively.
that
in
this
case
for
reasons
which
i
would
go
into,
this
decision,
griffin
against
california
should
be
given
prospective
application
and
that
that
prospective
application
should
in
fact
be
applied
to
this
case.
i
say
that
and
at
the
risk
of
being
too
brief,
i
am
relying
heavily
upon
this
court's
decision
in
the
linkletter
case
which
followed
griffin.
the
decision
had
a
thorough
review
of
the
arguments
for
and
against
prospective
or
retrospective
application,
had
a
--
an
intelligent
review
of
the
reasons
behind
decisions
that
have
been
given
prospective
application
and
decisions
which
have
not.
and
i
feel
that
the
similarities
between
the
two
principles
that
are
involve
although
the
linkletter
case
had
to
do
with
the
evidence
rule
of
the
mapp
case
and
this
has
to
do
with
the
comment
by
the
prosecution
in
a
criminal
case.
although
those
are
different,
i
feel
that
the
principles
involved
are
the
same
and
that
for
that
reason,
the
reasoning
in
the
linkletter
case
can
be
identically
applied
in
arriving
at
the
same
conclusion
in
this
case.
as
i
indicated
to
this
court
in
my
factual
statement,
the
trial
was
had,
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
having
sold
securities
without
a
license
and
of
selling
an
unregistered
security.
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand,
comment
about
his
failure
to
testify,
an
explain
was
made
by
the
prosecutor.
i
was
one
of
the
prosecuting
attorneys
who
actually
presented
the
case
for
the
state
and
my
co-counsel,
the
prosecutor
whose
comments
are
the
basis
for
this
appearance
unfortunately
had
a
heart
attack
earlier
this
year
and
died.
in
fact,
while
we
were
here
and
he
had
his
first
seizure,
but
other
than
that,
the
reasoning
that
this
court
put
forward
leads
me
to
say
that
it
might
be
suggested
today
that
it
would
be
fantastic,
i
believe
that
is
exactly
the
way
it
was
stated
in
the
respondent's
brief,
it
would
be
fantastic
to
deny
the
retrospective
application
to
all
cases
that
have
ever
been
tried
since
the
year
one.
and
i
submit
that
this
approach
is
not
so
that
if
we
would
consider
that
to
be
fantastic
and
if
we
would
feel
that
we
would
have
to
apply
this
retrospectively
to
all
cases
such
as
in
the
gideon
case
then
we
would
get
enmeshed
in
a
dog
chasing
its
tail
type
of
situation
where
there
would
be
no
end.
instead
this
type
of
rule,
the
evidence
principles
of
this
rule
requires
that
we
have
a
starting
point.
and
as
this
court
judiciously
and
legally
and
clearly
stated
in
its
linkletter
case,
it
got
the
look
at
several
things
involved
in
the
case
being
considered
before
making
a
determination,
a
final
determination
of
prospectivity
or
retrospectivity.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
stewart,
i
don't'
know
the
anticipated
question
like
this,
but
i
left
cincinnati
in
great
haste
yesterday
afternoon
and
somehow
grabbed
an
ohio
bar
which
has
the
most
recent
ohio
supreme
court
case
on
this
point.
it's
reported
in
3
ohio
state
second
at
page
212.
the
style
of
the
case
is
pinch
against
maxwell,
warden
of
the
ohio
state
penitentiary.
that
was
a
case
–-
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
the
citation
is
3
ohio
state
second,
page
212.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
there's
one
since,
but
this
is
the
latest
one
i
have
on
my
desk.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
this
case
was
substantially
the
same
as
what
we
have
here
in
that
although
it
was
a
burglary
case
i
believe,
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
stand.
there
was
comment
made
that
he
was
convicted
and
this
court
i'm
certain
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
ohio
prior
to
malloy
against
hogan
or
prior
to
girffin
against
california,
ohio's
constitution
permitted
such
comment
wasn't
just
the
statute,
but
the
constitution
permitted
it
the
same
as
in
california.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
constitutional
provision,
the
comments
were
made.
the
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
leaned
heavily
on
this
court's
language
in
the
griffin
case
and
in
the
linkletter
case.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
it
was
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
no
it's
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
yes.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
but
at
any
rate
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
maxwell
is
the
warden
of
the
ohio
state
by
that.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
pinch
is
the
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
p-i-n-c-h.
he
was
the
convicted
defendant
in
this
burglary
case
and
as
i
have
indicated
the
ohio
supreme
court
leaned
heavily
on
the
language
that
this
court
used
in
its
linkletter
case
and
made
it
applicable
to
the
principles
involved
in
this
comment
case
and
for
whatever
interest
it
might
have,
i
marked
one
paragraph
that
it
is
the
second
last
paragraph
in
the
opinion
which
is
the
only
part
of
the
opinion
that
i
can
find
that
isn't
in
quotes
and
having
not
been
taken
from
this
court's
the
language.
it
says
to
apply
griffin
retrospectively
which
serve
as
a
foundation
for
upsetting
convictions
in
a
large
number
of
cases
decided
long
ago
wherein
the
accused
failed
to
testify
and
the
court
and
prosecuting
attorney
commented
on
such
fact
in
accordance
with
the
procedure
formally
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
are
you
–
are
you
referring
at
to
the
malloy
against
hogan.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
that
it's
not
to
be
applied
retrospectively.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
in
effect,
this
decision
recites
that
there
has
been
a
previous
reliance
upon
the
validity
of
the
constitutional
provision
referring
to
the
adamson
case
and
twinding
and
so
forth.
so
that
with
that
thought
in
mind
and
this
case
was
decided
on
september
the
29,
1965
with
that
in
mind
and
with
this
court's
reasoning
in
mind
in
the
linkletter
case
if
we
were
to
examine
those
areas
that
this
court
said
must
be
examined
before
determining
whether
to
go
retrospective
or
prospective,
that
is
first
of
all
consider
whether
or
not
the
right
that
we're
talking
about,
in
this
case
the
self
incrimination
privilege,
whether
that's
a
basic
right
that
would
go
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial
itself.
i
don't
believe
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
the
comment
by
the
prosecutor
had
anything
to
do
with
the
elements
of
conviction
of
a
crime.
in
other
words,
no
matter
what
the
prosecutor
said,
it
neither
convicted
nor
acquitted
a
defendant
whose
conduct
was
complained
of.
the
state
still
had
to
prove
that
he
did
what
he
said
he
did.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
well
i
--
again,
as
i
say
that
was
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
i
know
that
mr.
arnold
has
taken
that
position
in
his
brief
and
he
has
on
prior
occasions,
but
having
been
at
the
trial
itself
and
having
had
myself
exposed
to
the
chronological
happenings
of
these
things,
the
comment
by
mr.
sutler
upon
ed
shott's
failure
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
in
no
way
substituted
for
evidence
in
the
case.
there
was
adequate
evidence
of
the
sale
of
a
security
and
then
it
was
a
public
sale
from
which
the
jury
could
conclude
exactly
what
it
did.
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
a
rehash
of
the
facts
in
the
case.
they
are
in
the
printed
transcript
but
while
i'm
on
the
subject,
i
recall
the
witness,
sestido,
who
was
an
unusual
personality
to
say
the
least
but
in
the
indirect
examination,
he
revealed
to
the
jury
that
he,
a
furniture
store
salesman,
had
heard
about
the
prospects
of
making
big
money
in
making
investments
to
the
shott
investment
company
that
he
had
heard
it
in
another
area
of
the
city
among
automobile
dealers
which
would,
i
believe
be
a
factual
statement
to
the
jury
from
which
they
could
conclude
that
that
kind
of
notoriety
had
to
come
from
repeated
transactions.
and
it
is
further
strengthened
by
way
of
evidence
that
was
actually
adduced
at
the
trial
that
the
note
that
was
given
and
which
is
claimed
to
have
been
one
of
the
exempted
transactions
in
that
it
was
--
it's
claimed
to
have
been
a
private
transaction,
the
note
was
signed
ed
shott
investment
company
by
ed
shott
rather
than
as
an
individual.
so
i
say
that
although
the
trial
itself
was
brief,
there
was
evidence
from
which
this
jury
could
and
did
determine
exactly
what
it
set
out
to
determine,
that
is
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
i
can
answer
that
yes
and
no
for
this
reason.
the
security
laws
in
ohio
that
is
the
entire
section
if
it
is
read
from
the
first
to
the
last
section
starts
off
by
saying
it's
unlawful
to
sell
securities
without
a
license.
and
then
there's
a
section
that
says
that
a
note
is
a
security.
but
there's
a
third
section
which
grants
an
escape
or
grants
a
--
an
excuse
to
persons
dealing
in
private
transactions
so
that
the
presumption
is
that
if
you
engage
in
the
sale
of
a
security,
the
selling
of
a
note
without
a
license,
you're
guilty
but
you're
given
the
opportunity
to
show
that
–-
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
--
similar
to
the
narcotics
laws
that
would
say
it's
unlawful
to
posses
morphine
however
in
some
exempted
preparations,
you
may
in
fact
have
and
that's
what
happened
here
and
that's
why
to
me,
as
a
trial
order,
it
was
somewhat
of
a
surprise
to
have
felt
satisfied
in
the
showing
of
prima
facie
case
in
behalf
of
the
state
under
our
procedure.
if
we
get
pass
the
directed
verdict,
we
have
a
right
to
expect
that
we've
proved
some
sort
of
a
case.
and
then
i
anticipated
that
the
defendant
would
attempt
to
show
by
introducing
actual
testimony
of
the
private
nature
of
this
transaction
and
other
transactions,
but
he
didn't
do
this.
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury
and
to
--
we,
attorneys
who
were
involved
on
both
sides
of
this
case,
the
judge
was
very
disturbed,
judge
webert
whom
you
may
know,
because
he
indicated
to
us
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
took
three
days,
he
slept
on
it
overnight.
he
said
that
if
it
was
a
civil
case,
he
would
direct
the
verdict
on
the
basis
of
what
had
happened,
but
because
it
was
a
criminal
case,
he
felt
that
he
could
not
do
that
that
the
jury
would
have
to
conclude
certain
things
or
not
find
certain
things
and
to
return
a
brief.
as
it
turned
out
and
as
judge
peck
said
in
his
lengthy
opinion,
the
jury
did
have
issues
to
determine
in
spite
of
the
admissions
made
by
counsel
for
the
defense
in
this
trial
and
rendered
its
guilty
verdict,
but
to
continue
and
conclude
what
i'm
saying
in
behalf
of
our
position
against
the
retrospective
application
of
the
griffin
rule
for
the
same
reasons
as
were
given
in
the
linkletter
case.
if
we
were
to
consider
the
purpose
for
the
rule
in
the
griffin
case
and
consider
whether
or
not
that
purpose
would
be
further
by
making
it
retrospective,
we
come
up
with
a
zero
because
a
retrospective
application
certainly
in
the
decision
in
griffin
would
in
no
way
accomplish
what
that
decision
actually
sets
out
to
accomplish
and
that
is
to
prevent
future
comments
by
prosecuting
attorneys
in
the
trials
of
criminal
cases
where
the
accused
does
not
take
the
stand.
there
was
a
certain
reliance,
if
i
might
use
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
the
constitution
does
not
but
the
case
law
that
in
the
annotation
said
that
this
is
not
only
in
the
constitution,
it
has
been
codified
in
the
revised
code.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
i
don't
recall
that
particular
point
having
actually
been
argued
but
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
ours
is
very,
very
similar
if
not
identical
to
the
provision
in
california
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
and
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
i
don't
exactly
recall
what
the
griffin
instruction
was
however,
in
opposition
to
the
suggestion
that
you
just
made,
the
thought
of
process
in
my
mind
that
in
a
similar
case,
if
in
fact
there
were
and
the
case
is
similar
to
the
one
we
tried
here.
if
there
was
absolutely
nothing
said
by
the
court
by
way
of
explanation,
this
just
might
prompt
the
jury
to
arrive
at
an
even
stronger
--
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
well
i'm
talking
now
only
about
this
case
and
this
case
the
defendant
is
an
attorney
and
a
member
of
the
bar
and
this
was,
as
i
said
a
ponzi
type
scheme
that
didn't
involved
just
this
amount
of
money
in
this
case
but
it
--
i
really
don't
know
how
much,
maybe
millions
of
dollars.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
not
to
this
particular
part.
as
this
court
i'm
sure
is
aware
we
were
at
that
stage
not
given
the
advantage
of
malloy
against
hogan
and
we
have
the
constitutional
provision
so
that
even
the
defense
counsel
were
relying
upon
the
right
to
make
the
comment.
they
--
i'm
certain
objected
to
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
to
the
actual
language
that
was
used
in
that
it
was
considered
to
have
been
harsh
or
strong,
stronger
than
perhaps
propriety
would
have
required
but
other
than
that,
in
this
case,
over
a
three-day
period,
we
actually
were
engaged
in
a
--
in
maybe
a
two-hour
conflict
and
that
was
it
and
anything
that
has
happened
since
has
been
in
the
appellate
courts.
all
of
the
appeals
in
this
case
were
thoroughly
exhausted.
and
i
say
thoroughly,
i
think
advisably
because
the
appeal
that
--
there
were
two
bites
all
the
way
up
to
the
line.
in
other
words,
an
appeal
to
the
first
district
court
of
appeals
in
ohio
and
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
affirmed
and
then
there
was
a
reapplication
for
a
rehearing
and
that
was
denied.
and
then
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
two
times
and
then
here
on
a
petition
which
was
denied
and
then
a
reapplication
and
then
we
got
into
the
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court.
but
if
in
using
the
thinking
that
this
court
used
in
linkletter,
if
this
court
feels
that
we
are
dealing
--
if
we
can
distinguish
between
what
this
court
referred
as
being
evidentiary
rules
as
against
basic
rights
such
as
were
involved
in
the
griffin
against
illinois
case
where
the
indigent
prisoner
wasn't
able
to
appeal
because
he
couldn't
pay
for
the
transcript
or
the
gideon
case,
the
right
to
counsel.
if
we
can
say
alright,
those
are
basic
rights
that
preclude
the
giving
of
a
fair
trial
and
in
those
cases
of
necessity
we
must
make
the
rules
retrospective
that
can
be
understood.
and
then
the
distinction
on
the
other
side
being
that
as
far
as
rules
of
evidence
are
concerned
whether
or
not,
illegally
obtained
evidence
disturbs
the
--
or
interferes
with
a
fair
trial
or
whether
or
not
comment
by
an
attorney
on
the
accused
failure
to
take
the
stand
actually
disturbs
or
disrupts
the
fairness
of
the
trial
itself.
if
these
are
two
different
avenues,
then
in
the
evidentiary
category,
the
rule
should
not
be
made
retrospective
but
prospective
only.
to
do
it
retrospective
would
i
think,
upset
the
vested
rights
if
we
can
use
this
phraseology
of
the
public
at
large
who
have
prior
to
the
new
decision
relied
upon
their
constitutional
guarantee
and
i
don't
know
if
i
brought
it
with
me,
i
did.
i
wanted
to
make
one
comment
that
the
procedure
in
ohio
being
that
once
we
get
past
the
directed
verdict,
our
procedure
being
in
reliance
on
this
constitutional
provision,
then
we
have
a
right
to
continue
that
reliance
until
such
time,
as
this
court
has
changed
it,
which
was
at
the
time
of
its
malloy
decision
or
subsequently
the
griffin
decision.
i
have
concluded
there's
really
nothing
else
i
can
add
other
than
what
has
been
said
in
the
briefs.
mr.
calvin
w.
prem
the
only
additional
comment
that
i
would
have
to
make,
if
the
court
pleases,
is
that
in
response
to
what
mr.
arnold
suggested
to
the
court
about
the
preliminaries
in
this
case
and
i
keep
referring
to
how
brief
this
trial
was,
i've
had
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
transcript
especially
on
page
22
that
part
of
the
trial
which
were
the
opening
statements
of
counsel.
it
was
in
the
opening
statement
and
this
is
what
judge
peck
in
the
federal
district
court
commented
upon
in
his
opinion.
in
the
opening
statements
of
counsel,
a
considerable
amount
of
information
was
revealed
to
the
jury
concerning
this
defendant's
activities
in
that
he
was
loaning
money
indicating
plural
transactions
to
a
man
named
stickler
who
–
stickler
was
actually
actively
involved
in
this
ponzi
type
scheme.
so
i
call
that
to
the
court's
attention.
