brennan,

what's
that
citation
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
it
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
on
direct
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
state
habeas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
state
habeas.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
sound
is
if
then
the
--
your
own
supreme
court
in
a
collateral
proceeding
would
have
reached
precisely
the
result
the
court
of
appeals
did
here,
also
in
a
--
for
the
federal
habeas,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,no.
this
i
gather
some
application
to
griffin,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
holding
that
it's
not
retrospective?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
and
so
they
sustained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
prem,
may
i
ask
you,
is
this
the
usual
form?
i
noticed
at
page
70
of
the
record
in
the
instructions,
the
constitution
of
ohio
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
required
to
testify
against
himself.
however
the
constitution
also
provides
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
maybe
commented
upon
by
the
state.
now
does
the
constitution
go
on
to
suggest
here
in
the
record
and
that
you
may
draw
any
inference
from
--
it's
better
to
testify
that
you'd
been
a
reasonable
inference,
did
the
constitution
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
the
constitution
only
goes
how
far
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
maybe
commented
upon
by
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
instruct
the
jury
that
the
constitution
says
also
that
you
may
draw
any
inference
and
it's
better
than
testify
that
you
deem
a
reasonable
inference.
is
that
in
your
case
law
as
part
of
the
interpretation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
--
so
that's
determined
as
broad
inference,
isn't
it?
i'm
familiar
with
one
of
these
in
my
own
state
in
new
jersey
but
we
don't
let
it
go
that
far.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
as
i
recall
it,
the
griffin
instruction
wasn't
as
broad
as
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that's
the
old
argument
as
to
whether
comment
means
much
need
more
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
judge
arnold,
may
i
ask
this.
you
said
--
i
know
on
direct
review
in
this
case
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
now
we
denied
certiorari
in
may
1963
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
rehearing
in
june,
1963
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
when
we
granted
certiorari
in
griffin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
october
1963.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
just
a
few
months
after
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
but
it
was
filed
here
on
october
after
we
had
denied
near
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
this
point
raised
in
the
petition
that
we
denied
in
your
case?
