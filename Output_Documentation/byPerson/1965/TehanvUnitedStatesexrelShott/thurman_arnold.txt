mr.
thurman
arnold
mr.
chief
justice
–-
mr.
thurman
arnold
–
may
it
please
the
court.
we
take
the
position
on
the
bribe
question
that
the
decision
in
griffin
must
be
made
retroactive
and
we
take
further
position
that
regardless
of
whether
it
is
retroactive
or
prospective,
there
is
no
possibility
that
it
can
be
used
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
and
further
that
the
case
was
pending
at
the
time
of
griffin
under
the
rule
in
linkletter.
now
i
want
to
restate
the
evidence.
we
believe
because
there
is
not
a
word
in
this
record
that
this
defendant
had
any,
the
relator
had
any
connection
with
the
ponzi
scheme
of
a
man
named
stickler,
not
a
lot.
there
is
not
a
line
in
this
record
that
shows
any
inference
of
guilt
at
all.
he
testified,
the
witness
where
the
state
testified
that
he
had
gone
to
his
friend
and
had
made
a
speculative
loan
and
he
received
a
note
back
and
the
note
had
been
made
paid.
the
realtor
thought
that
he
had
met
the
burden
of
proof
which
the
ohio
law
apparently
puts
upon
the
transaction
such
as
this.
the
ohio
law
says
that
there
must
be
a
public
offering,
a
public
offering
in
the
pretty
large
corner
before
a
note
can
be
treated,
the
issuance
of
a
promissory
note
can
be
treated
as
violations
about
the
security
law.
here
although
they
had
investigated
the
situation,
they
chose
to
prove
only
one
single
transaction
and
that
would
alone
[inaudible]
to
the
state's
witnesses
and
that's
all
and
then
they
relied
on
the
burden
of
proof.
they
said
that
shifted
the
burden
of
proof,
that
innocent
transaction
shifted
the
burden
of
proof
to
to
explain
it
on
to
the
defendant.
and
finally,
the
prosecutor
commented
on
this
evidence
in
a
way
which
we
had
some
time
when
we
appealed
before
griffin
on
law
that
certainly
did
not
come
within
the
adamson
rule.
the
adamson
rule,
as
we
understood
it,
allowed
the
prosecutor
to
comment
upon
the
defendant's
failure
to
explain
evidence
against
him
and
here
there
wasn't
a
line
of
evidence
that
needed
explanation.
so
he
didn't
take
the
stand
and
in
the
prosecutor
at
length
commented
upon
his
failure
to
take
the
stand,
i
guess
–
one
example
from
page
6
of
my
brief
and
there
he
sits
for
just
one
reason
because
he
can't
look
you
in
the
eye.
he
can't
tell
you
that
because
it
isn't
so
because
there
was
more
than
one
transaction.
there
was
a
multiplicity
of
transactions
and
that
is
where
the
crime
has
been
committed.
it's
now
an
objection
previous
to
this,
there's
a
lot
of
conversation,
the
objection
is
overruled.
so
here
is
the
prosecutor
testifying
[inaudible]
back
to
the
court
that
this
was
a
public
offering.
and
we
thought
that
that
did
not
--
could
not
possibly
be
included
even
under
the
adamson
rule.
on
december
2,
1962,
we
appealed
and
filed
in
orderance
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
court
held
that
until
may
13,
1963
and
incidentally
the
decision
--
the
--
in
1963
--
in
october
1963,
a
certiorari
was
filed
in
griffin
whereas
our
certiorari
was
filed
in
december
of
1962.
and
on
may
13th,
our
appeal
and
orderance
writ
of
certiorari
was
denied,
justice
black
dissenting
on
the
ground
of
probable
jurisdiction
had
been
shown.
now
had
that
been
granted,
that
certiorari
it
would
be
griffin
without
here
saying
that
this
thing
should
retroactively
apply
to
me.
it
wouldn't
be
a
charge.
in
other
words,
it's
a
result
with
a
pure
matter
of
luck
in
the
race
to
the
supreme
court
that
griffin
got
here
first
although
his
petition
in
certiorari
wasn't
filed
the
next
year
after
ours
was.
then
on
june
24,
1963,
which
was
the
day
after
the
mandate
came
down
from
denial
of
our
appeal
on
the
certiorari,
we
filed
a
habeas
corpus,
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
and
in
that
petition,
we
raised
the
constitutionality
of
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
meaning
of
transaction,
the
fairness
of
the
trial
on
the
adamson
rule,
and
also
the
constitutionality
of
the
adamson
decision
itself
and
the
court
held
that
for
about
five
months.
the
court
decided
that
quicker,
we
would
have
beaten
griffin
to
this
court
because
in
griffin,
the
certiorari
was
filed
october,
1963
in
the
case
which
was
decided
in
may
28,
1965.
so
we
first
point
out
that
surely
in
--
there
were
two
proceedings
are
being
brought
to
the
supreme
court
and
one
is
decided
before
the
other.
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
that
this
purchase
of
the
form
of
proceeding
by
means,
on
decided
proceeding
was
on
pending.
now
in
the
second
case
which
took
place,
we
point
out
that
if
griffin
is
to
be
given
a
prospective
effect,
it
must
be
purely
prospective.
it
must
relay,
it
must
leave
previous
cases
where
and
previous
individuals
where
they
were
found.
but
in
order
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
state
has
to
claim
although
he
haven't
reached
the
argument,
they
have
to
claim
that
it
is
prospective
as
to
all
individuals
but
retroactive
in
the
sense
that
the
court
will
go
back
and
of
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
the
court
admit
was
correctly
decided.
now
that
has
this
sort
of
alice
in
wonderland
to
me.
mr.
thurman
arnold
no,
this
case
decided,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
comment
on
the
--
a
unit
of
extension.
the
opinion
of
these
two
paragraphs
in
some
page
8
--
mr.
thurman
arnold
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
comment
on
the
evidence
--
i
mean
of
a
failure
to
take
the
stand
was
unconstitutional
and
they've
decided
on
the
basis
of
malloy
and
this
court
has
now
by
griffin,
if
there
ever
was
any
question
about
malloy,
affirmed
the
result
in
the
--
that
case.
so
now
--
mr.
thurman
arnold
yes.
mr.
thurman
arnold
that's
right.
mr.
thurman
arnold
yes,
i
do.
i
got
the
date
right
here.
you
granted
the
certiorari
on
--
it
was
filed
october,
1963.
mr.
thurman
arnold
yes.
mr.
thurman
arnold
yes.
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
the
date
it
was
granted.
mr.
thurman
arnold
that's
right.
mr.
thurman
arnold
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
thurman
arnold
in
the
petition,
we
denied
--
we've
raised
the
point
as
to
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
fairness
of
trial
and
--
i
mean
the
burden
of
proof
ploy,
the
fairness
of
trial
and
we
asserted
that
even
under
adam
--
adamson,
this
kind
of
comment
would
not
be
allowed.
and
you
could
say,
i
think
or
technical,
that
we
did
not
raise
the
precise
point
in
the
petition
for
serve
which
i
have
filed
copies
of
the
petition
cert
that
adamson
was
unconstitutional.
but
i
think
that
this
court
had
taken
certiorari
unquestionably
that
question
would
have
come
up
and
we
did
raise
a
precise
point
that
adamson
was
unconstitutional
in
our
proceedings
for
habeas
corpus.
and
that
with
a
little
more
luck
could
have
reached
the
supreme
court
before
the
decision
in
griffin
which
was
april
28,
1938.
so
i
see
no
--
i
see
no
possible
way
of
saying
that
this
case
was
not
pending.
i
suppose
the
only
argument
could
be
made
and
it
is
made
is
that
habeas
corpus
is
sometimes
of
a
collateral
proceeding
and
we
only
look
as
what's
pending
in
--
on
the
great
proceedings.
but
surely
those
contentions
can
no
longer
be
made
after
fay
versus
noia
where
the
court
that
mr.
justice
brennan
encouraged
people
not
to
bring
certiorari
at
all
and
so
i
do
not
see
--
i've
been
[inaudible]
said
but
said
not
defending
and
the
fact
is
that
it
is
still
passing
if
the
test
is
looking
and
adopted.
it
is
still
pending
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
ohio.
there
is
a
mandate
there
which
directs
the
court
even
to
try,
it's
stated
january
8.
it
directs
the
court
even
to
try
relate
or
--
or
to
release
him
within
90
days.
and
the
release
i
suppose
that
maybe
suspended
that
90
days
gone
by
but
i
suppose
that
was
suspended
by
the
proceeding
for
certiorari.
so
it's
pending
on
the
docket,
it's
pending
within
the
rule
of
the
linkletter
and
even
if
it
wasn't
pending,
you
couldn't
use
it
to
reverse
a
corrected
deciding
case
by
the
court
of
appeals
without
saying
to
the
court
of
appeals
now
don't
decide
these
cases
until
your
first
crime
whether
we're
going
to
cite
--
make
the
decision
retroactive
or
not
otherwise
you
will
have
to
reverse.
this
saying
doesn't
make
sense.
now
as
to
the
broader
question,
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
perhaps
this
case
is
not
a
proper
vehicle
to
bring
up
--
bring
the
issue
of
retroactivity.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
two
cases,
one
in
california
and
the
other
in
ohio
have
been
decided
stating
that
this
decision
is
only
prospective
and
not
retroactive,
we
will
draw
this
suggestion
that
because
it
might
be
considered
a
dicta.
this
rule
should
not
be
decided
in
this
case
because
other
state
courts,
this
will
become
through
other
state
courts
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
rule
against
dicta
or
the
rule
that
where
you
can
decide
the
case
on
a
broader
ground
or
a
narrower
ground.
you
should
always
decide
on
a
narrower
ground
should
apply
to
this
case.
i
think
this
case
the
court
should
act
and
decide
the
issue
here.
now,
i
will
argue
the
principle
issue.
i
say
that
under
the
decision
in
linkletter,
this
case,
the
griffin
decision,
must
be
given
a
retroactive
effect.
now
what
standard,
mr.
justice
clark
laid
down
in
linkletter.
the
first
standard
was
did
the
state
rely
on
the
former
decision,
the
former
decision
in
linkletter
was
brought
back
and
the
answer
to
that,
of
course
in
our
case
is
this.
the
state
did
rely
upon
adamson.
then
the
second
standard
that
mr.
justice
clark
laid
down
was
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
ruling
in
the
former
case
which
it
refers
to?
obviously
in
mapp,
the
purpose
did
not
concern
that
trial
itself
or
any
part
of
the
appellate
procedure.
it
related
only
to
the
pre
trial
efforts
of
the
prosecutor
to
get
evidence.
it
was
not
part
of
the
trial.
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
trial
itself
was
not
fair
because
the
evidence
was
completely
relevant
and
the
majority
in
griffin
had
said,
that
this
pretrial
conduct
that
the
prosecutor
had
to
be
disciplined
and
that
was
the
real
purpose
of
the
rule
in
mapp
and
that
cannot
be
said
here.
here
in
the
--here
the
constitutional
effect
was
part
of
the
trial.
if
the
court
have
decided
that
it
was
not
a
fair
trial
where
comment
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand
was
made
by
the
prosecutor
and
that
is
ample
proof
by
the
time
the
comment
should
get
in
the
particular
kind
of
comment
we
got
in
the
--
this
case.
so
that
--
and
then
the
court
finally
test,
the
third
test
laid
down
by
the
griffin
case
was
what
effect
does
the
new
decision
have
upon
the
administration
of
justice
and
they
pointed
out
that
whether
a
--
an
evidence
obtained
--
an
evidence
was
obtained
by
illegal
search
and
seizure
is
a
very
complication,
factual
product
on
which
judges
are
constantly
differing.
the
court
pointed
out
the
tremendous
burden
it
would
be
to
try
such
factual
issues
over
again
and
let's
contest
that
with
the
situation
here.
here
the
only
factual
issue
which
is
to
be
determined
is
the
factual
issue
whether
the
prosecutor
commented
and
in
99
cases
out
of
100,
that
will
be
right
on
the
record
and
in
the
100th
case
where
the
record
is
lost,
the
burden
of
proof
of
that
comment
will
be
on
the
petitioner.
so
that
so
far
as
they're
being
complicated
factual
issues
of
concern,
there
isn't
a
possibility
of
the
kind
of
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
which
this
court
feared
in
linkletter.
so
this
leaves
the
offense
of
the
position
that
the
mapp
--
which
the
decision
should
not
be
retroactive
solely
to
an
argument
which
had
not
yet
been
made
that
the
argument
that
this
will
be
a
great
big
jail
delivery.
well
i
think
if
it
would,
the
other
cases
gideon
hasn't
been
and
there
might
be
some
statistics
shown
by
the
court
to
indicate
jail
delivery
and
perhaps
that's
a
reason
they
don't
mention
in
jail
delivery.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
jail
delivery
by
itself,
the
fear
of
a
lot
of
people
getting
loose
who
were
tried
have
been
rejected.
in
the
griffin
versus
illinois,
the
failure
to
furnish
a
free
contract
that
was
on
the
appeal
was
made
retroactive
in
the
case
of
eskridge.
and
in
the
gideon
case,
the
–
it
was
made
retroactive
by
doughty
versus
maxwell.
both
of
these
cases
involved
the
fairness
of
the
trial
and
the
idea
that
maybe
somebody
might
get
loose
was
not
considered
sufficient
justification.
and
indeed
in
linkletter
itself,
mr.
justice
clark
points
out,
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
innocent
man
or
a
guilty
man
might
be
freed
is
not
sufficient
to
cause
to
raise
this
for
not
making
the
case
retroactive.
so
i
assert
to
this
court
that
under
the
test
of
linkletter,
this
case
must
be
made
retroactive
and
second,
that
whether
whatever
test
you
put
it
on,
it
cannot
be
made
prospective
in
the
sense
that
no
one
cannot
take
advantage
of
it
who
did
not
have
a
pending
case
under
the
same
retroactive
to
reverse
a
correct
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
impossible
i
say
also
that
it
was
pending
and
now
i
have
not
briefed
and
argued
the
issues
which
were
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
prior
to
their
two
paragraph
decision
after
the
malloy
case
was
decided.
those
issues
are
one;
can
the
state
shift
the
burden
of
the
proof
to
the
defendant
to
explain
an
innocent
man?
if
i
have
brought
one
end
of
the
note
to
the
bank,
must
i
prove
that
i
haven't
issued
so
many
notes
just
to
make
a
public
transaction
and
say
that
in
the
constitution?
and
second
we
say
that
retroactive
or
not
retroactive,
the
--
this
particular
comment
was
not
--
would
not
deprive
the
defendant
of
a
fair
trial
even
under
adversaries.
now
those
matters,
we
have
not
briefed
them
because
i
felt
that
the
case
couldn't
without
[inaudible]
but
if
the
court
disagreed
to
this,
you
will
--
the
clerk
allowed
us
to
put
our
jurisdictional
statements
and
arguments
[inaudible]
i
think
they're
certified
--
we
have
certified
copies
in
the
court,
i
think
that
the
court
disagrees
my
argument
here,
it
should
go
into
those
other
questions.
