mr.
david
w.
peck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
to
the
matter
of
fundamental
or
essential
honesty
in
the
product
and
pricing
here
and
satisfy
the
court
as
to
that
element
which
i
found
it
rather
strange
that
the
commission
wanted
to
treat
as
a
complete
irrelevancy.
it
has
as
been
the
mary
carter
paint
company
here,
and
it
alone
who
has
wanted
to
go
into
the
question
of
quality.
and
the
evidence
is
in
and
it
is
abundantly
in,
despite
the
fact
that
the
hearing
examiner
ruled
it
immaterial,
because
under
the
rules,
he
took
it
and
under
the
rules
he
made
a
finding.
the
evidence
could
not
be
clear
and
it
is
cumulative
and
it
is
abundant,
that
the
paint
of
this
company
is
just
as
good
or
bad,
than
comparably
priced
paints
of
the
leading
brand
manufacturers.
this
company
was
born
with
a
basic
idea
which
i
submit
is
fundamentally
honest,
that
it
was
going
to
produce
a
high
quality
product,
that
it
was
going
to
sell
it
on
the
basis
of
economy,
by
giving
what
was
fairly
expressed
as
double
value
and
that
it
was
going
to
express
that
in
it's
advertising
in
the
terms
of
saying
that
every
second
can
was
free.
now
the
question
naturally
arises
why
did
it
pick
on
this
slogan,
every
second
can
free,
because
the
federal
trade
commission
had
ruled
precisely
on
the
question
that,
that
form
of
advertising
and
merchandising
was
permissible
or
as
commissioner
elmen
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
federal
trade
commission
here,
mary
carter
had
every
right
to
rely
upon
the
book-of-the-month
club
and
black
decisions.
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
upon
those
decisions
because
to
appreciate
this
case
you
have
to
get
the
sequence
of
events
as
to
exactly
what
has
happened
with
the
federal
trade
commission's
dealing
with
the
word
free.
it
goes
back
to
1948,
when
the
book-of-the-month
was
advertising
just
as
mary
carter
is
advertising,
that
you
buy
two
books
and
you
get
one
free
and
that
the
book-of-the-month
club
had
done
from
the
day
it
started
business,
that
was
the
book-of-the-month
stock
in
trade,
that
was
its
policy,
it
began
that
way
and
so
far
as
i
know
it
has
continued
that
way.
and
a
complaint
was
made
by
the
commission
on
the
subject
and
the
commission
held
that
this
was
misleading
advertising,
on
a
very
simple
basis
in
an
opinion
by
commissioner
meede
(ph),
he
said
free
means
free.
the
absolute
meaning
of
the
word,
it
has
no
other
meaning.
and
unless
you're
giving
something
away
with
no
strings
attached
and
you
don't
have
to
buy
anything
to
get
it,
it's
not
free.
now
that's
an
understandable
position
and
that's
the
position
that
the
commission
took.
but
the
very
next
year,
this
was
their
decision
in
book-of-the-month
in
1952,
the
very
next
year
1953,
the
composition
of
the
commission
having
changed
somewhat,
the
black
case
came
up
and
the
black
case
was
like
the
book-of-the-month
club
in
which
they
were
saying
enroll
here,
buy
four
books
and
we'll
give
you
one
free.
now
there
was
no
question
that
if
the
commission
was
going
to
adhere
to
its
1952
book-of-the-month
club
decision,
black
was
impermissible.
but
the
commission
in
quite
a
lengthy
opinion,
certainly
in
a
most
carefully
considered
opinion,
philosophically
and
practically
facing
up
to
this
matter,
they
said
we
are
going
to
reverse
ourselves;
we
are
going
to
change
the
rule,
because
we
are
convinced
there
is
a
matter
of
reality.
that
this
use
of
the
word
free
is
something
that
the
business
men
of
this
company
have
been
doing
for
100
years
and
so
long
as
it's
done
clearly,
so
that
nobody
can
misunderstand
it,
we're
going
to
allow
it,
as
a
matter
of
considered
judgment
and
with
the
most
solemn
pronouncement
of
the
fact,
they
said
until
congress
changes
the
federal
trade
commission
act
or
a
court
gives
it
a
different
interpretation,
this
is
now
going
to
be
our
rule
and
they
said
we
state
it
now
for
the
advice
of
the
business
men
of
the
company
so
that
they
can
understand
what
is
permissible
and
what
is
not
permissible.
and
at
the
end
of
their
decision,
they
said
it
would
however
be
an
unfair
trade
practice.
if
you
use
the
word
free
without
making
it
clear
what
your
proposition
is,
or
if
you
raise
the
price,
your
usual
price
or
reduce
the
quantity
or
reduce
the
quality
as
a
predicate
for
your
free
offer,
that
was
not
only
the
decision
of
the
commission
but
they
adopted
a
rule,
among
their
pricing
guides
in
which
they
incorporated
this
term
of
the
decision
into
a
rule
of
the
commission
and
announced
in
the
year
1953.
and
they
said
in
their
black
decision
quoting
from
a
brief,
that
their
counsel
had
submitted
to
this
court,
they
expressed
it
philosophically
this
way.
said,
but
if
the
regular
price
of
the
article
sold
without
the
premium
is
the
same
as
the
price
with
the
premium,
the
premium
doesn't
cost
the
customer
anything,
it
is
free
to
him.
and
they
put
the
free
to
him
in
capital
letters,
every
letter
of
those
words
to
emphasize
the
point
that
they
were
making,
that
under
those
circumstances
it
was
free
to
the
purchaser
and
he
didn't
care
whether
it
was
an
advertising
promotion,
whether
the
seller
was
charging
so
much
that
he
could
recoup
and
make
plenty
of
profit
on
that
basis
or
whether
he
sold
at
a
loss,
in
any
event
it
was
the
proper
use
of
the
word
free,
and
may
i
say
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
commission
has
never
deviated
from
that
position
up
until
this
moment
and
it
faced
up
to
this
matter
anew
as
lately
as
the
year
1964.
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
1958
guide
line
referring
to
the
two
for
one
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
which
is
certainly
true
as
mr.
lewin
has
admitted,
a
can
of
this
paint
is
sold
for
the
price
that
is
on
it
is
$6.98,
you
couldn't
buy
it
for
any
less,
nobody
has
bought
it
for
any
less.
as
commissioner
elman
said
of
the
statement
in
the
commission's
majority
opinion
that
this
wasn't
the
usual
price,
he
said
this
simply
is
not
so
and
i
stand
on
it,
it
simply
is
not
so
and
mr.
lewin
has
admitted
to
the
court
rightly
and
frankly
that
$6.98
is
the
single
gallon
price
of
this
paint
and
the
only
price
at
which
it
can
be
bought.
now,
usually
somebody
if
he
can
get
a
second
can
free
is
going
to
take
the
second
can
but
not
always,
not
always.
mr.
david
w.
peck
you
can
buy
a
single
can
for
$6.98,
yes
and
people
come
in,
say
i
only
want
that.
mr.
david
w.
peck
he
can
get
one
free
if
he
wants
it,
yes.
mr.
david
w.
peck
oh,
you
mean
come
back
the
next
day?
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes.
same
transaction,
yes
just
like
in
book-of-the-month,
he
can
buy
two
books
and
he
gets
one
free.
now,
the
economics
of
it
is
perfectly
plain
as
the
federal
trade
commission
has
said.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
david
w.
peck
there
is
no
factual
dispute,
but
for
some
reason
or
other
which
i
am
unable
to
follow
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
no
one
has
suggested
that
we
don't
do
what
we
say
we
do.
mr.
david
w.
peck
to
which
commissioner
elman
said
that
simply
is
not
so.
mr.
david
w.
peck
he
was
in
the
minority,
but
the
court
of
appeal
also
agreed
with
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
to
my
mind
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
a
matter
of
semantic.
mr.
david
w.
peck
they
say
that
we
do
not
have
a
usual
price.
mr.
david
w.
peck
for
one.
mr.
david
w.
peck
but
the
clear
fact
is
that
we
do,
because
people
buy
it
at
that
price
and
that's
the
only
price
that
they
can
buy
it
at.
and
i
can
only
say
that
it
simply
is
not
true.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
no
your
honor,
no
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
only
evidence
is
that
it
is
sold
and
people
buy
it
on
the
basis
of
a
single
can
and
when
they
buy
it
on
the
single
can
basis
that's
the
price
they
pay
for
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
or
there
is
a
tiny,
little,
something
that
isn't
worth
mentioning
and
my
friend
hasn't
mentioned
--
the
fact
is,
that
this
price
has
been
maintained
and
they
haven't
fooled
around
with
it.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
this
--
wherever
they
sell
this
product,
if
$6.98
a
gallon.
now,
i'm
going
to
come
to
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
peck
just
like
the
book-of-the-month,
they
buy
two
books
and
they
get
another
one
free.
now,
i
think
i
should
say
this
in
all
honesty
mr.
justice
black,
i
can
understand
the
commission's
first
book-of-the-month
club
decision,
i
can
understand
the
commission
saying,
we
don't
like
people
using
the
word
‘free’
unless
it's
absolutely
free.
mr.
david
w.
peck
but
that's
not
what
they
said
in
black,
what
they
said
in
the
second
book-of-the-month
club,
they
said,
we
are
going
to
trim
our
sales
to
the
reality
of
business
practice
and
recognizing
that
nobody
is
fooled,
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time.
and
people
understand
it.
as
they
put
it
in
the
black
decision,
people
understand
the
economics
of
this.
and
in
1964,
this
matter
all
came
up
anew
in
this
way,
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
permissible
use
of
the
word
free,
so
much
so
that,
in
the
summer
of
1963,
the
commission
held
a
public
hearing,
in
which
they
invited
everybody
to
come
in
and
say
what
they
thought
about
the
proper
use
of
the
word
free
and
whether
or
not
the
rule
should
be
changed
in
anyway
and
they
promulgated
to
focus
attention.
two
different
rules
or
versions
of
a
free
rule
for
the
purposes
of
getting
comments.
one;
which
they
call
rule
a,
would
have
been
a
reversion
to
the
old
original
book-of-the-month
club
rule,
that
you
can't
say
something
is
free
unless
it
is
absolutely
free
with
no
strings
attached,
nothing
you
have
to
purchase,
in
other
words,
it’s
given
away.
and
b,
was
virtually
the
rule
as
it
has
existed
under
black,
and
a
lot
of
people
came
in,
a
lot
of
people
came
in,
this
went
on
for
a
matter
of
two
days
and
practically
nobody
wanted
rule
a.
there
was
this
discussion
about
rule
b
which
is
highly
irrelevant
to
the
suggestion
which
is
made
here,
that
a
free
offer
carries
with
it
implicitly
that
it's
for
a
limited
time,
and
not
a
regular
practice.
now,
of
course
you
can't
square
book-of-the-month
or
black
with
that
argument
because
both
book-of-the-month
and
black
like
mary
carter
were
from
the
beginning
to
the
present
always
day
in
and
day
out
on
the
same
basis
book-of-the-month
buy
two
you
get
one
free.
but,
there
were
a
number
of
people
who
came
in
with
the
thought
which
mr.
lewin
expresses,
that
this
ought
to
be
for
a
limited
time
and
you
shouldn’t
be
entitled
to
use
the
word
‘free’
unless
it
is
for
a
limited
time.
and
they
suggested
that
the
rule
be
amended
to
make
that
provision.
now,
of
course,
the
point
at
that
is
clear,
everybody
understood
and
commissioner
dixon
in
his
statements
which
i
quote
in
my
brief
made
it
crystal
clear,
that
there
was
no
such
limitation
implicit
or
in
any
manner,
shape
or
form
in
the
rule
as
it
exists,
and
by
what
talking
about
should
we
add
something
and
when
they
got
through
hearing
everybody,
they
republished
the
rule
in
1964
in
virtually
the
same
language
that
they
had
it
in
1953.
so
that
in
1964,
the
commission
deliberately
made
the
decision
that
it
was
going
to
stick
by
the
black
and
the
book-of-the-month
club
rule
and
was
not
going
to
graft
on
this
idea
of
a
time
limitation
which
we
are
now
told
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
rule.
mr.
david
w.
peck
mr.
justice
fortas,
i'm
going
to
have
to
correct
the
impression
you
have
about
that
and
i
want
the
facts
to
be
perfectly
clear,
because
there
is
an
argument
along
this
line
and
it
is
the
argument
of
the
reply
brief
and
i
might
say
that,
that
argument
has
a
weight
of
the
reply
briefs
in
this
court
before
it’s
been
suggested
here
before.
not
before
the
commission,
not
before
the
court
of
appeals,
not
in
their
principal
brief
here,
that
they
ever
make
this
argument,
but
in
the
reply
brief,
they
finally
come
up
with
another
argument
here.
now,
let’s
be
precise
about
it,
black's
free
offer
related
only
to
new
members
who
came
in
committed
themselves
to
buy
four
volumes
in
the
course
of
a
year.
volumes,
by
the
way
that
had
no
standard
in
the
market
of
any
kind,
these
were
triple
volumes
of
the
detective
stories
which
black
and
black
alone
put
together
in
manufacturing.
they
said
if
you
commit
yourself
to
buy
four
of
these,
we
will
give
you
one
free,
that
was
black.
now
book-of-the-month
had
two
aspects
to
it,
one
was
exactly
that
same
as
black,
in
rule
commit
yourself
to
buy
four
books
during
the
course
of
the
year
and
you
will
get
andersen’s
fairytales
free.
but
they
went
on
and
said
also
for
every
two
books,
you
buy
you
get
one
free
as
a
book
dividend,
they
used
the
word
‘free’
and
they
used
the
word
book
dividend.
now
it
was
(inaudible)
that
commissioner
elmen
said
if
i
may
quote
him.
comparing
this
mary
carter
case
to
book-of-the-month
he
said,
“both
involve
a
continuing
offer
over
an
indefinite
period
of
time
that
can
be
acted
upon
again
and
again
by
the
same
purchasers.
now
it
is
suggested
in
the
reply
brief,
that
after
all,
the
book-of-the-month
club
decision
didn’t
pass
upon
that
use
of
the
word
free
in
the
second
sentence.
but
somehow
or
other
the
holding
was
confined
to
the
use
of
the
word
free
in
connection
with
the
enrollment
book
and
therefore
after
all
these
years,
it
is
now
discovered
that
this
is
a
brand
new
issue,
which
has
never
been
passed
upon
before,
as
to
whether
you
can
say
buy
one
can
and
get
one
free
or
buy
two
books
and
you
can
get
one
free.
now,
i
will
have
to
ask
your
indulgence
for
a
few
moments
to
answer
that,
because
coming
in
the
reply
brief,
i
don’t
have
any
opportunity
to
answer
it
unless
your
honors
should
see
fit
to
give
me
leave
to
put
in
another
piece
of
paper
here.
but
let
me
say
this
about
it,
in
the
first
place,
the
commission
either
said
it
was
all
right
or
they
said
it
wasn’t
all
right
and
i
really
don’t
care,
which
it
is.
what
they
said
was
that
the
use
of
the
word
book
dividend
as
applied
to
the
book
that
you
get
after
you
buy
two,
that,
that
charge
has
not
been
sustained
and
it
is
suggested
by
mr.
lewin
that
all
that
means
is
that
somehow
or
other
there
was
some
shortage
of
the
evidence
of
the
subject.
now
it
isn't
the
kind
of
a
subject
in
which
you
need
any
evidence,
there
it
was
as
plain
as
it
could
be,
why
the
commission
said
the
charge
hadn't
been
sustained,
whether
they
had
decided
that,
that
was
perfectly
all
right,
which
satisfies
me
or
whether
they
didn’t.
the
order
that
they
entered
clearly
covered
either
use
of
the
word
‘free’,
because
it
was
a
broad
order
which
said
that
the
book-of-the-month
could
not
use
the
word
‘free’
to
describe
any
book
that
was
not
given
away
without
the
condition
of
buying
anything
to
get
it.
now,
plainly
you
had
to
buy
two
books
to
get
the
one
book
free
and
the
cease
and
desist
order
plainly
covered
that
use
of
the
word
free.
and
if
there
could
be
any
question
about
it,
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
book-of-the-month
case
started
out,
that
very
first
sentence
it
says
this
is
a
case
about
a
company
they
gives
its
customers
one
book
for
every
two
they
buy.
so
there
couldn’t
be
any
question
in
anybody's
mind
that
the
use
of
the
word
free
on
the
broadest
possible
basis
was
involved
there
covered
and
disposed
off.
and
as
commissioner
elmen
said
that
in
this
case,
referring
to
book-of-the-month
he
said
there
the
club's
offer
amounted
to
buy
two
book
and
get
one
free.
and
he
said,
the
case
is
indistinguishable
from
book-of-the-month
and
the
commissioner
never
said
in
the
majority
opinion
or
counsel
for
the
commission
in
the
court
of
the
appeals,
oh
now
that's
not
what
the
case
involved
at
all,
it
only
dealt
with
this
introductory
offer.
now,
i
needn't
argue
to
the
court
that
the
commission
cannot
play
fast
and
loose
with
its
rules.
it
cannot
engage
in
what
judge
brown
aptly
said
here
was
individualized
discrimination
against
mary
carter.
it
hasn’t
asked
to
reconsider
this
rule,
it
stands
by
black
and
book-of-the-month.
it
had
the
whole
issue
up
in
1964
after
mary
carter
and
deliberately
decided
it
was
going
to
maintain
its
rules.
i
submit
as
commissioner
elmen
observed
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
that
this
case
is
indistinguishable
on
any
substantial
ground
from
book-of-the-month
and
black,
that
the
attempted
distinctions
are
really
fascicle
and
upon
the
basis
of
the
commission's
rules
which
they
elect
to
stand
by,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
should
be
affirmed.
