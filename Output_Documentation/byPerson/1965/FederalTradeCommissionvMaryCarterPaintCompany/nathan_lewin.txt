mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
trade
commission
case,
which
is
here
in
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
presents
the
question
whether
respondent's
use
of
the
word
‘free’
in
its
advertising
slogans
was
properly
held
by
the
commission
to
amount
to
a
deceptive
practice
within
the
meaning
of
section
5(a)
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
critical
facts
are
undisputed
and
i
shall
state
them
briefly.
respondent
began
manufacturing
various
kinds
of
paints
and
selling
it
under
the
trade
name
mary
carter
in
about
1950
and
it
now
distributes
its
products
to
the
public
as
it
has
done
in
the
past
through
wholly
owned
and
franchise
retail
stores
in
the
southern
and
eastern
sections
of
the
country.
the
company
has
been
resoundingly
successful.
it
grew
at
a
great
rate
in
the
first
decade
of
its
existence
concededly
because
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
advertising
slogans
and
sales
policy
which
had
been
advertised
which
is
at
issue
here.
respondent's
own
officers
in
the
testimony
before
the
federal
trade
commission
called
it
the
keystone
of
respondent's
advertising
policy.
it
has
been
so
successful
that
in
five
years
from
1955
to
1960
its
total
sales
increased
from
slightly
over
$1
million
annually
to
more
than
$12
million.
the
disputed
policy
is
as
follows.
respondent
packages
its
paint
in
quart
and
gallon
cans,
but
it
sells
to
the
public
on
terms
which
are
succinctly
stated
in
its
two
most
commonly
used
advertising
slogans,
“buy
one
get
one
free”
or
“every
second
can
of
paint
free”,
occasionally
they
add
to
that
the
words
“of
extra
cost”.
consumers
are
told
in
other
words
that
a
single
quart
can
of
mary
carter
paint
sells
for
225,
that's
the
usual
price
most
of
the
quart
cans,
but
that
a
free
can,
“free”
is
given
with
every
can
that's
purchased
for
225.
similarly,
respondent
represents
that
the
price
of
most
of
its
one
gallon
cans
is
698,
but
that
a
second
can
will
be
“given
free”
with
every
698
purchase.
on
these
facts,
the
federal
trade
commission
after
appropriate
proceedings
found
with
one
member
dissenting
that
the
use
of
the
word
free
violated
section
5
and
that
it
impliedly
misrepresented
the
customary
and
usual
retail
price
of
mary
carter
paint
and
it
entered
a
cease
and
desist
order.
the
court
of
appeal
disagreed
and
they
entered
an
order
directing
the
commission
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
i
should
like
to
turn
first
to
the
question
of
deception,
which
troubled
the
dissenting
commissioner
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
more
particularly
to
the
broader
issue
whether
even
if
mary
carter
makes
its
entirely
clear
on
its
advertisements
that
this
is
a
consistent
sales
policy
buy
one
get
one
free
or
every
second
can
free,
the
use
of
the
word
free
is
deceptive.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
that
we
accept
for
purposes
of
this
case
mary
carter's
claim
that
it
consistently
directed
its
retailers,
franchise
dealers
and
wholly
owned
retail
outlets
not
to
sell
a
single
can
of
paint
at
less
than
698
or
225.
in
other
words
that
these
dealers
were
instructed
that
two
cans
of
paint
and
one
can
of
paint
should
bear
the
same
price.
the
question
is
whether
under
these
circumstances
the
commission
could
find
that
it
was
deceptive
to
call
the
second
can
free.
now
there
can
hardly
be
any
doubt
i
would
think
that
the
word
free
or
any
language
carrying
that
kind
of
meaning
is
a
very
potent
attraction
to
consumers
and
buyers.
it
makes
them
buy
maybe
out
of
what
judge
brown
and
his
concurring
opinion
call
a
habit
of
self
delusion
as
to
free
products.
if
buyers
are
likely
to
be
mislead
by
mary
carter's
use
of
the
word
free
into
thinking
that
they
are
being
given
a
bonus
that
they
are
not
actually
receiving
and
if
they
then
buy
that
can
or
that
product
of
paint
rather
than
a
competing
product
because
of
that
reason,
the
representation
if
it
is
false
or
misleading
may
certainly
be
prevented
by
the
commission.
the
representation
is
misleading
in
this
case
we
submit
simply
because
the
word
free
as
used
by
mary
carter
means
nothing
more
that
the
company
is
chosen
to
call
one
can
of
a
two
can
package
free
and
has
chosen
to
attach
to
the
other
cans
the
full
retail
sales
price.
if
it's
sales
policy
is
stripped
of
the
mary
carter
slogan,
then
it's
obvious
that
what
all
that
the
company
is
doing
is
it's
selling
paints
in
combination
packages
of
two
cans
and
it
is
charging
for
the
two
cans
what
is
in
effect
a
two
can
price.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
the
commission's
opinion
and
we
submit
that
was
right,
the
quality
of
the
paint
was
irrelevant.
the
commission
examiner
excluded
testimony
regarding
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
price
of
paint
of
competitive
quality
is
i
think
irrelevant
as
to
question
of
whether
mary
carter's
own
sales
policy
is
deceptive,
in
other
words
the
fact
that
mary
carter
paint
maybe
equal
to
paint
of
698
quality
or
maybe
better
or
worse
doesn't
we
submit
entitle
it
to
call
one
of
two
cans
that
it
sells
free.
it
may
justify
mary
carter
in
setting
its
price
at
698
and
advertising
to
the
public,
we
are
giving
you
paint
that's
as
good
as
698
paint
or
setting
the
price
of
349
a
can
and
advertising
to
the
public,
our
paint
it
is
good
as
698
quality
paint
at
349.
so
you
are
getting
double
your
value.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mary
carter
attempted
to
introduce
evidence
into
of
the
record
that
their
paint
was
equal
in
quality
to
competitor’s
paint
selling
at
698.
mr.
nathan
lewin
per
gallon
and
the
examiner
excluded
that.
now
for
purposes
of
the
case
at
the
present
juncture
we're
willing
to
accept
for
our
arguments
sake
that
the
paint
is
as
good
as
other
paint
of
698
quality
and
that
mary
carter
maybe
able
to
truthfully
to
represent
that
it
is
as
good
as
other
paint
of
698
quality.
well
of
course
these
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
consumers
choices
maybe
determined
by
in
terms
of
quality,
in
other
words
mary
carter
can
sell
its
paint
at
any
price
it
chooses
and
claim
that
it
is
of
a
certain
quality
and
the
consumers
are
free
to
believe
or
disbelieve
that.
all
the
commission
says
is
that
they
may
not
set
as
six
--
therefore
claim
that
another
can
is
being
sold
free.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that's
covered
by
the
commission's
order
and
properly
so
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
gives
the
consumer
the
very
same
impression
--
they
could
say
the
two
cans
for
698
and
you
can't
get
less.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
commission
i
believe
would
say
that,
that
is
proper
so
long
as
the
offer
is
a
limited
time
offer,
in
other
words
it
will
ultimately
within
a
reasonable
time,
i
don't
think
the
commission
would
allow
this
to
go
on
for
a
year
or
two,
but
if
it's
a
one
month
offer
or
a
two
month
offer
and
the
price
then
would
go
back
to
698
per
gallon
and
two
gallons
would
sell
in
effect
$14,
then
that
would
be
a
fair
representation
to
consumers
for
that
limited
period
they
are
in
effect
receiving
a
bonus
which
they
can't
receive
when
the
offer
does
not
exist.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
there
is
no
time
limit
put
on
the
duration
of
the
offer,
then
a
buyer
who
sees
the
advertisement
is
being
deceived
because
he
thinks
that
the
seller
has
and
intends
to
have
in
the
future
a
regular
price
for
the
one
can.
if
mary
carter
decided
he
is
going
to
do
it,
in
effect
intermittently,
then
it
has
no
intention
of
selling
a
single
can
any
longer
at
698,
it
will
be
selling
into
the
future
two
cans
for
698.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
representation
is
implicit
in
the
advertisement.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
explicit
mr.
justice
fortas.
in
effect,
that
the
slogan
buy
one,
get
one
free
or
every
second
can
free
is
misleading
in
two
related
respects
really.
when
a
consumer
is
told
buy
one,
then
he
assumes,
as
he
has
every
right
to
assume
that
buy
one
means
buy
one
at
the
price
of
one
and
then
you
get
the
second
can
free.
when
in
effect,
mary
carter
has
a
consistent
policy
of
selling
two
for
what
is
purportedly
--
it's
price
for
one,
then
the
consumer
is
not
buying
one
at
the
price
of
one,
he
is
buying
one
and
getting
an
additional
can
for
the
price
of
two.
in
effect
both
buy
one
and
every
second
can
free
mean
the
same
as
two
for
the
price
of
one.
respondent
in
its
brief
in
this
court
claims
that
it
has
never
advertised
two
for
the
price
of
one.
but
the
representations
are
indistinguishable,
every
second
can
free
means
that
you're
getting
two
cans
for
the
price
of
one.
and
when
mary
carter
sets
its
price
in
effect
at
a
price
for
two
it
is
no
longer
giving
two
for
the
price
of
one.
now,
even
if
the
advertisement
had
added
to
it,
the
caveat
that
this
is
a
permanent
policy
of
the
company,
that
doesn't
in
any
way
avoid
the
misrepresentation.
saying
to
consumers
we
always
give
everyone
a
second
can
free,
is
self
contradictory.
the
only
way
you
can
translate
the
words
we
always
give
everyone
a
second
can
free
into
comprehensible
english,
is
to
say
that
it
means
we
always
sell
our
product
in
two
can
packages.
and
if
that's
what
mary
carter
is
doing
then
the
commission's
order
on
this
case
just
requires
it
to
say
that
and
not
use
the
words
free.
now,
it's
true
that
a
buyer
who
stops
to
think
and
can
puzzle
out
the
meaning
that
we
always
give
everyone
a
second
can
free
may
be
able
to
discover
after
considerable
thought
that
this
just
means
a
two
for
the
price
of
two
policy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
don't
do
it
in
quite
the
same
size
as
the
buy
one
get
one
free,
but
there
are
several
advertisements
in
the
record
here
in
which,
mary
carter
does
in
small
print
state
that
it
is
and
will
be
its
consistent
policy
to
sell
this
at
this
--
on
these
terms.
there
is
one
in
which
mary
carter,
reportedly
the
woman
who
is
in-charge
of
the
corporation
says
that
she
tells
her
board
of
directors
every
year,
that
we
should
start
selling
--
the
board
of
directors
tells
her
that
we
should
start
selling
paint
at
half
price
and
she
responds
to
them
no
i'll
never
do
that.
now
even
if
that
were
to
bring
across
to
consumer
the
message
that
this
is
not
a
limited
time
offer,
but
that
it
will
be
available
into
the
foreseeable
future,
nonetheless
we
contend
all
it
does
is
confuse
and
puzzle
consumers
and
they
can
only
assume
that
there
is
some
bonus
being
hidden
in
here
some
place
and
then
they
go
out
and
buy
the
product,
whereas
actually
there
is
no
bonus
there
at
all.
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
here
that's
really
free,
may
serve
to
demonstrate
the
point
more
clearly.
if
i
have
a
dozen
oranges
that
i
want
to
sell
for
$0.50
for
example.
i
can
list
the
sale
price
a
dozen
oranges
for
$0.50
or
i
can
advertise
that
i
am
prepared
to
sell
six
of
them
for
$0.50
and
give
away
one
free
with
every
orange
i
sell.
now
of
course
the
six
free
oranges
aren't
free
in
any
sense
other,
than
that
i
attach
that
word
to
those
six
oranges.
the
consumer
is
really
--
has
no
reason
to
buy
my
product
rather
than
someone
else's
because
i'm
just
not
giving
him
anything
in
the
way
of
a
bonus.
or
in
effect,
what
mary
carter
is
doing
here
is
the
same
as
if
anybody
who
sold
product
in
pairs,
a
manufacturer
of
socks
would
advertise
that
he'd
sell
one
sock
and
give
the
other
one
free.
or
a
haberdasher
would
say
i'm
selling
only
the
coats
and
the
trousers
are
being
given
away
free.
of
course,
nothing
is
given
away
free
there,
these
products
are
being
sold
in
pairs.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
was
just
coming
there.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
commission
distinguished
between
mary
carter's
use
of
the
word
free,
and
the
use
of
that
word
in
cases
like
black
and
book-of-the-month
club
on
the
ground
that
in
those
cases,
the
product
being
sold
had
a
usual
and
customary
or
usual
and
regular
price.
this
distinction,
we
believe
was
sound,
because
when
there
is
an
established
price
for
what
we
call
the
tying
items,
in
other
words
the
product
that
has
to
be
purchased
as
a
condition
for
receiving
the
supposed
free
item,
neither
of
the
two
misrepresentations
that
we've
previously
discussed,
neither
the
misrepresentation
as
to
usual
and
customary
price
nor
the
representation
that
something
is
being
given
away
free
has
actually
been
made.
the
word
free
under
those
circumstances
has
an
objectively
ascertainable
meaning
and
entirely
apart
from
the
seller's
own
manipulations
of
his
product,
a
purchaser
can
honestly
conclude
entirely
on
his
own
that
he
is
receiving
something
as
a
bonus.
the
simplest
case
of
course
in
which
some
is
free
is
when
it's
given
when
it's
given
with
no
strings
attached.
but
if
the
condition
of
obtaining
the
free
item
is
the
purchase
of
another
product,
the
commission
has
held
that
it
can
still
be
meaningfully
free
if
there
is
a
standard,
objective
standard
for
comparing
the
offer
being
made,
either
to
--
at
a
limited
time
or
to
a
limited
group
of
people,
with
what
is
the
practice
when
the
offer
is
not
in
existence.
in
other
words,
if
a
buyer
can
say
to
himself,
i
had
to
pay
$0.25
for
item
x
last
week
or
others
who
are
not
in
my
special
class
had
to
pay
$0.25
for
item
x.
and
either
this
week
or
because
i
am
in
a
particular
class,
i
am
able
to
obtain
both
items
x
and
y
for
$0.25,
then
he
is
getting
something
free
in
a
meaningful
sense.
he
is
getting
something
which
he
could
not
obtain
at
some
other
time
or
which
other
people
who
are
not
in
his
position
would
not
be
able
to
obtain.
now
that's
the
distinction
which
the
commission
made
between
this
case
and
the
book-of-the-month
club
and
black.
in
both
black
and
book-of-the-month
the
offer
was
being
made
to
new
enrollees
only.
in
other
words
they
were
told,
if
you
sign
up
in
our
book
club
you
will
receive
free
a
certain
number
of
books
on
the
condition
that
you
purchase
certain
others.
now,
the
other
members
of
the
club
who
were
not
new
members,
were
not
able
to
obtain
the
very
same
offer,
they
could
buy
all
the
books
which
were
being
sold
as
a
condition
for
receiving
the
free
premium
and
yet
they
would
receive
no
free
premium
at
all.
so
that
the
limited
class
of
people
to
whom
the
offer
was
directed
were
in
effect
receiving
something
free
in
some
sense
other
than
merely
the
seller's
own
arrangement
of
his
--
of
products
sold
in
a
package.
it's
not
as
if
the
seller
was
just
saying,
i
will
call
something
free
because
i'll
throw
it
into
the
package
at
the
same
price.
he
was
in
effect
saying
only
if
you
were
in
that
class,
can
you
receive
these
books
without
any
further
cost.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
we
don't
think
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
it's
broader
than
just
it
having
been
previously
offered
at
that
price,
it
has
to
be
offered
at
that
price
in
the
usual
course,
meaning
either
previously
or
maybe
after
the
offer
is
terminated.
in
other
words,
there
could
be
an
introductory
free
offer.
when
a
product
first
comes
on
the
market
and
a
manufacturer
has
the
intention
of
selling
it
at
a
given
price,
he
can
attach
something
to
it
at
the
outset
and
say
this
is
free.
or
it
could
be
an
offer
made
to
--
an
offer
or
unlimited
in
time,
made
to
only
a
limited
class
of
people
which
is
in
effect
what
black
and
book-of-the-month
club
were.
the
significance
of
that
is
that,
that
really
communicates
a
bona
fide
message
to
the
consumer
which
should
affect
his
purchasing
choice,
in
other
words
a
consumer
can
say,
if
i
can
obtain
a
premium
or
a
bonus
for
this
month,
whereas
as
i
couldn't
at
other
times
or
i
can
obtain
it
because
i
am
in
a
special
class,
where
these
other
people
aren't,
he
should
buy
on
that
account
but
he
shouldn't
buy
because
the
buyer
just
says
i
am
pegging
my
package
and
i
am
splitting
it
in
half
and
i
am
calling
it
half
of
it
free
and
i
am
attaching
the
whole
sale
price
to
the
other.
that's
just
misleading
and
to
the
extent
that
a
consumer
will
be
confused
and
will
think
he
is
really
obtaining
a
bonus
or
something
when
he
isn't
in
the
second
of
these
cases,
the
commission
can
justifiably
prohibit
the
use
of
the
word
free.
in
effect,
really,
we
submit
that
what
mary
carter
has
done
in
this
case
is
really
no
different
than
what
sellers
might
do
in
violation
of
the
rules
announced
in
the
black
case.
the
black
case,
in
which
the
commission
decided
in
1954,
in
the
black
case,
the
commission
set
down
guidelines
for
certain
types
of
free
advertisement
and
it
stated
that
in
cases
where
combination
or
in
cases
where
free
premiums
were
given
on
a
condition
that
another
product,
the
tying
product
was
purchased,
the
seller
could
not
raise
the
price
of
his
tying
product
for
purposes
of
covering
the
cost
of
the
supposed
free
premium,
because
that
would
obviously
be
deceptive.
a
seller
would
then
be
doing
not
--
would
not
be
offering
anything
free
he
would
merely
be
adding
whatever
the
premium
cost
to
the
basic
product.
now
what
mary
carter
has
done
here
is
simply
done
this
at
the
outset
of
it's
business,
if
it
is
able
consistently
to
offer
a
free
premium
or
a
free
can
of
paint
with
every
can
that's
purchased,
then
it
should
really
be
in
no
different
position
from
a
paint
manufacturer,
a
hypothetical
competitor
of
mary
carter
who
not
having
maybe
had
the
ingenuity
to
devise
these
advertising
slogans
at
the
outset,
so
this
paint
at
349,
although
it's
quality
was
698
quality.
now
that
kind
of
-–
that
competitor
could
not
under
the
black
rules
which
respondent
accepts
as
valid,
raise
its
price
from
349
to
698
and
then
advertise
as
giving
one
can
free.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
commission's
opinion
of
course
is
based
on
a
difference
between
this
case
and
black
and
i
think,
the
only
thing
the
court
could
do
is
of
course
if
there
was
really
no
difference
between
this
case
and
black
would
be
possibly
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
for
consideration
in
light
of
that
rule
of
law
to
see
whether
the
commission
would
overrule
black
if
it
were
faced
with
that
choice.
in
other
words,
the
commission
would
then
have
the
choice
of
either
overruling
black
entirely
and
going
back
to
its
old
rule
which
had
been
sustained
by
the
second
circuit
or
condoning
the
practice
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
not
merely
a
matter
of
adding,
it's
that
word
free,
that
really
has
a
magic,
a
magic
flavor,
otherwise
respondents
don't
accept
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
knows
he
put
out
some
money
but
he
thinks
he
is
getting
a
bargain
that
he
is
not
getting.
this
is
the
very
same
type
of
deception
in
effect,
as
the
commission
has
prohibited
and
let’s
say
in
pre-ticketing
cases,
where
the
commission
say
that
it's
deceptive
to
say
that
something
has
been
sold
at
a
higher
price
and
then
or
is
offered
for
sale
at
a
higher
price
and
then
actually
sell
it
at
a
lower
price.
although
the
consumer
goes
home
with
his
product
and
he
knows
what
he
is
paying,
he
thinks
he
is
getting
a
bargain.
but
the
same
thing
is
true
here,
the
consumer
thinks
he
is
getting
a
bargain,
he
thinks
he
is
getting
something
free,
of
course
he
knows
what
he
has
bought,
but
he
doesn't
know
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
commission
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
the
commission
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
mr.
justice
black
that's
was
in
the
advertisements.
the
advertisements
themselves
are
reproduced
in
the
record.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes.
well,
and
the
commission
thinks
that's
perfectly
alright,
when
it's
really
done
as
it
was
in
that
case
with
a
new
grocery
store,
they
are
giving
you
something
because
they
opened
the
store
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
they
always
did
it
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
they
would,
it's
precisely
the
same
practice
as
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
well
that's
what
this
case
involves,
this
case
involves
a
situation
where
mary
carter
has
always
done
it
and
admittedly
has
always
done
it
and
always
intends
to
continues
to
do
it,
so
they
are
not
giving
anything
free
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely,
but
that's
like
buying
one
half
of
amount,
you
want
one
half
of
amount
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
but
they
are
candy
bars
mr.
justice
stewart,
for
example
that
are
sold
in
two
fragments
at
a
dime.
if
you
were
interested
in
buying
one
you'd
have
to
pay
a
dime.
now
the
manufacturer
of
that
candy
bar
couldn't
advertise
and
given
you
one
free,
he
is
not
giving
anything
free,
he
is
selling
you
two
for
a
dime.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
there
is
no
appreciable
difference
in
standard
education.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
since
the
commission
based
its
reasoning
on
--
did
not
base
its
result
on
any
principle
like
that,
that
you
are
suggesting
mr.
justice
black,
the
rules
of
cases
like
chinery
and
these
others
would
require
that
the
commission
reexamine
this,
that
the
case
be
sent
back
and
then
to
consider
what
the
result
would
be
under
what
this
court
determines
as
the
proper
standard.
i
guess
the
court
really
couldn't
sustain
the
commission
if
it
felt
otherwise
on
the
commission's
reasoning.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
commission
believed
the
book-of-the-month
club
was
different
because
there
was
an
established
price
at
which
the
book-of-the-month
club
and
black
offered
it's
books
to
people
who
were
not
in
the
class
which
was
being
given
the
free
offer,
in
other
words,
those
people,
the
ones
who
were
given
the
free
offer,
could
say
we're
getting
something,
we're
getting
a
bonus
that
other
people
are
not
getting,
and
if
the
commission
--
if
the
book-of-the-month
club
or
black
is
going
to
tell
them
that,
they
have
to
have
words
with
which
to
communicate
that
information
and
all
that
the
commission
said
is
they
can
communicate
that
information
by
means
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
our
view
that's
not
what
the
book-of-the-month
club
decision
involved,
we've
set
out
at
length
in
our
reply
brief
what
it
did
involve,
because
we
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you.
mr.
nathan
lewin
do
i
have
anytime
for
rebuttal
your
honor?
mr.
nathan
lewin
do
i
have
anytime
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice?
