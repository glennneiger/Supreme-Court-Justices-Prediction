justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lewin
suppose
mary
carter
had
sold
it's
paint
at
these
same
prices
for
a
year
let's
say
--
and
then
for
the
succeeding
year,
two
years
or
however
you
may
want
to
vary
it,
had
made
this
special
offer,
what
would
the
government's
position
be
as
to
the
theory
applicable
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
why
would
that
be
misleading,
suppose
mary
carter
said,
we
just
don't
want
to
do
that
in
the
federal
trade
commission,
we
want
to
sell
this
one.
why
is
that
misleading
in
one
case
and
not
misleading
in
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
but
this
couldn't
rise
that
regular
price
issue,
that's
another
problem,
isn't
it?
all
it
says
is,
is
you
buy,
all
these
ads
say
you
is
that
you
buy
one
can
and
you
get
another
can
free.
now
it
doesn't
make
any
--
or
am
i
wrong
about
this,
do
they
make
any
representations
about
buy
one
can
at
the
regular
price
and
get
another
can
free?
is
there
any
such
representation
here?
justice
abe
fortas
but
not
explicit.
justice
abe
fortas
i
should
be
--
i
hope
you
are
going
to
get
to
the
distinction
between
this
and
the
practice
permitted
by
the
commission's
rules
in
the
book-of-the-month
club
fees
and
black.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
what
you
are
saying.
but
i
wish
you
had
helped
me
and
explained
to
me
why
one
is
misleading
and
the
other
is
not,
now
in
mary
carter's
case,
you
tell
us
that
you
will
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
the
quality
is
as
good
as
other
products,
competitive
products
selling
at
the
same
price,
that's
number
one.
number
two,
you
tell
us
that
the
examiner
excluded
evidence
as
to
other
products.
number
three,
perhaps
i'd
better
ask
you
this,
is
there
any
dispute
with
respect
to
the
assertion
that
the
selling
price
is
more
adhered
to
as
stated,
that
is
the
698
a
gallon
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
not
disputed.
so
what
you
are
in
effect
saying
i
take
it
is
that
there
is
only
one
way
that
you
can
have
a
non-misleading
free
offer
and
that
is
if
the
precise
product
has
previously
been
sold
at
the
stipulated
price,
is
that
right?
but
that
if
it's
--
if
there
is
any
other
standard,
if
it's
misleading,
it
seems
that's
perhaps
an
incorrect
way
to
state
your
argument,
and
i
would
like
to
hear
you
elaborate
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
record
mr.
peck
showing
the
results
of
a
survey
or
otherwise
as
to
how
much
of
this
paint
is
sold
or
even
a
one
shot
basis
where
the
customer
can
just
pick
up
the
free
can.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
any
evidence
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record,
if
i'm
correct
and
understand
you
to
the
effect
that
some
--
that
there
have
been
sales
at
less
than
these
--
what,
i
suppose
your
suggested
prices
aren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
like
some
states
in
which
you
don't
want
to
do
that
aren't
there?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
peck,
as
i
understand
mr.
lewin's
argument,
it
is
to
the
effect
that
in
the
book
club
type
of
arrangement
you
do
have
an
objective
practice
by
which
a
regular
price
for
the
same
article
is
established,
that
is
to
say
that
you
have
a
requirement
and
itâ€™s
for
that
reason
that
he
places
emphasis
upon
what
he
says
is
the
fact
that
the
free
offer
is
made
only
to
part
of
the
group,
that
is
to
say
to
initial
subscribers,
which
i
had
known,
but
that's
what
he
said.
and
that
in
your
particular
case,
there
is
no
objective
referral
for
establishing
that
this
is
anything
accept
a
fictitious
price,
and
that's
my
understanding
of
his
argument
that
is
confusing.
