so
it
would
be
relevant
as
to
what
paint
of
equal
quality,
sold
a
competitive
paint
of
equal
quality,
but
itâ€™s
sold
for
whether
it
was
around
about
$2.25
a
quart
or
whether
it
was
closer
$4
a
can
or
a
$1.15?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
asking
about
the
price
for
paint
of
competitive
quality?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
evidence
on
this
subject
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
per
gallon.
justice
potter
stewart
except
mr.
lewin,
i
thought
you
told
us
you
accepted
and
conceded
as
a
fact
that
if
you
bought
one
quart
it
would
be
the
same
price
to
an
quarter.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suggest
it's
not
like
buying
one
sock,
because
there
is
some
use
for
one
quarter
paint.[laughter]
