justice
byron
r.

really,
i
gather
the
commission
really
thinks
that
somebody
be
confused
by
accepting
consistently
advertising
in
this
manner,
anybody
can
add
or
subtract
or
divide
by
two,
is
this
--
are
they
really
confused
at
all
by
any
part
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
it
has
a
certain
magic
there,
but
do
you
think
anybody
is
really
fooled,
that
you
have
to
put
out
some
money
to
be
given
--
take
home
two
gallons
of
paint
or
whatever
it
is.
he
knows
he
put
out
some
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that's
what
you
stated
and
what
the
consumer
thinks.
are
you
suggesting
that
maybe
a
consumer
would
think
that
at
all?
i
have
had
a
lot
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
got
two
gallons
of
paints
for
whatever
cost
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
a
bargain
or
not
may
depend
on
that
what
they
think
of
paying
the
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
statements
were
a
representation
of
an
offer
to
sell
two
articles
for
the
price
of
one
or
phrase
the
similar
imports
to
be
used
in
this
sales
price
for
the
two
articles
is
the
advertiser's
usual
and
customary
retail
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
found
that
you
really
didn't
have
and
the
government
argues
that
your
regular
price,
isn't
for
the
price
of
one
at
all.
that
itâ€™s
--
you
don't
have
a
regular
price
for
one,
you
have
a
regular
price
for
two.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
elman
was
in
the
minority.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
somebody
has
said
that
you
were
doing
something
different
than
you
say
you
were
doing.
the
commissioner
says
you
don't
have
a
regular
price
for
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
that
what
they
found
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
