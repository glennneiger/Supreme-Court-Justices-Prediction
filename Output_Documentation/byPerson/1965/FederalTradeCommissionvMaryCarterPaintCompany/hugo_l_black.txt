justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
man
in
the
court's
opinion
below
correct
as
to
what
the
advertisement
contains,
buy
one,
get
one
free.
every
second
can
free
of
extra
cost,
every
second
can
free,
is
that
what
is
in
the
advertisement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
frequently
done
isn't
it,
i
happen
to
do
it
last
week
myself.
at
the
new
grocery
store
they
were
advertising,
you
buy
one
case
of
this,
we'll
give
you
a
case
free
and
i
went
in
and
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
why
wouldn't
it
be
all
right,
whether
they've
opened
a
new
grocery
store
or
not,
if
they
didn't
deceive
you
of
anything.
what
they
did
was
to
say
you
buy
one
case
at
the
regular
price,
that's
what
they
said
and
did
and
we'll
give
another
one
free.
well
would
the
commission
let
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
they
always
did
it
because
then
they
would
not
be
doing
it,
that
would
be
the
regular
price.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
this
case
in
standard
education?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
court
--
what
judge
han
(ph)
wrote
there
and
which
we
reversed,
that
we
cannot
take
seriously
the
suggestion
that
a
man
who
is
buying
a
set
of
books,
on
ten
years
extension
service
will
be
factious
enough
to
be
misled
by
the
mere
statement
that
the
first
are
given
away
and
that
he
is
paying
only
for
the
second
one.
he
said
such
trivial
messages
are
too
implausible
for
practical
affairs,
they
are
really
(inaudible)
which
divert
attention
from
substantial
evil.
we
held
he
was
wrong,
he
might
be
practical
enough
to
know
that,
but
other
people
might
not
be.
and
we
reversed
it
unanimously.
what
they
were
doing,
said
you
buy
one
book,
we'll
give
you
another
one
free.
what
should
one
do
if
they
think
you've
departed
from
that
change
and
these
other
cases
that
we
mentioned,
but
have
stuck
to
it
here,
you
say
they
want
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
there
be
much
argument
about
man
being
fooled
at
least
many
people
being
fooled,
they
advertised
and
told
to
come
in
there,
because
you
going
to
buy
one
of
these
cans,
then
we're
going
to
give
you
another.
why
should
anybody,
how
can
anybody
argue,
that,
that
wouldn't
be
deception?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
that
what
was
done
in
these
book-of-the-month
club?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
the
use
of
the
word
free.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
you're
saying
is
that
i
gather,
the
book-of-the-month
club
would
advertise
a
$3.50
book
and
everybody
knows
that’s
the
regular
price.
they
say
now
the
regular
price
was
$3.50.
if
you
buy
one
for
$3.50,
we'll
give
you
another
one
free,
is
that
what
happened
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
won’t
ask
you
more,
your
time
is
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
buying,
can
he
get
one
free?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
he's
paid
$6.98
for
one
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
well
after
he
pays
the
regular
price
for
it,
or
a
can,
if
he
can
get
one
free.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
do
you
say,
i
don't
see
why
there
is
any
quarreling
between
you.
that
would
not
be
deception
if
you
do
what
you
say
you
do.
if
you
say
you'll
let
him
buy,
walk
in
and
buy
--
let's
take
something
else.
if
you're
selling
a
can
of
something
else
for
$4,
that's
your
regular
price,
that's
what
you
always
get
for
it,
you
advertise
and
say
if
you
come
in
and
buy
one
of
our
cans
on
our
regular
price,
we
will
give
one,
another
one
just
like
it
free,
can
you
do
that,
is
that
what
you
did
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
is
there
any
dispute
between
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
defending
on
the
ground
that
you
do
what
you
actually
say
you
will
do,
when
you
realistically
interpret
the
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
$6.98,
they
don't
get
another
gallon
free,
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
get
another
gallon
free?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
what
i
thought
the
law
refers.
