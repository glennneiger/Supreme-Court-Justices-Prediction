mr.
bailey
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
when
you
referred
to
the
view
of
the
editor
that
the
fix
was
in
i
thought
you
said
but
i
don't
want
to
look
it
up
now
but
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
in
terms
of
a
editorial
or
testimony?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)[laughter]
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
who
agreed
that
it
should
be
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
so
it
isn't
quite
a
matter
of
the
judge
directing
this,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
question
is
was
--
was
this
deposition
or
statement
or
whatever
it
was,
dorothy
kilgallen
offered
or
in
what
form
was
it
referred
to,
what
does
that
transcript
show
prior
to
the
time
when
transcript
sets
out
the
--
what's
in
the
deposition.
that's
what
we're
asking
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
statement
appears
(voice
overlap)
on
page
388
(a)
of
volume
3
of
this
blue
transcript
of
record,
the
statement
on
mr.
bailey
offering
or
with
reference
to
the
kilgallen
statement.
mr.
bailey
says,
the
statement
taken
for
a
submission
with
the
stipulation
resulting
from
the
order
of
the
court
of
may
6,
1964.
it
was
agreed
by
the
parties
to
have
the
status
of
the
deposition.
is
that
in
your
copy
of
the
transcript?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
refer
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general
is
--
are
there
any
rules
of
court
in
ohio
with
respect
to
photographing
the
jury
in
the
courtroom?
justice
abe
fortas
i
notice
that
one
of
these
press
clippings
does
include
a
photograph
of
the
jury
and
it
looks
as
if
the
photograph
may
have
been
taken
in
the
courtroom.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
us
whether
that
is
a
general
practice
or
unusual
practice
or
do
you
know
of
any
other
murder
case
in
ohio
in
which
photograph
of
the
jury
has
been
permitted
even
before
or
after
a
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
in
the
record
but
i
notice
from
the
clipping
of
the
cleveland
press,
november
3,
1954,
it
appears
that
counsel
for
dr.
sheppard
did
object
to
these
photographs.
do
you
know
whether
that's
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
now
this
relates
to
the
photographs
of
the
jury
at
this
clipping
is
it
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
in
the
record,
mr.
corrigan?
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
in
the
--
it's
not
in
the
habeas
corpus
record
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
developed
at
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
corrigan,
as
i
understand
that
mr.
murray
testified
to
somewhat
the
same
effect
as
miss
kilgallen.
is
mr.
murray
a
clerk
of
the
trial
court
for
[inaudible]?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
the
--
didn't
he
remember
the
name
of
the
lawyer
macca
or
mayer?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
however
that
maybe.
