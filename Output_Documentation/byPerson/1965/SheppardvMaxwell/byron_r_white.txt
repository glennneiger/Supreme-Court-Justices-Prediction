justice
byron
r.
white
who
would
toss
this
accusation
and
who
asked
him
to
take
the
lie
detector?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
jury
on
this
matter
in
the
motion
or
during
your
motion
--
proceedings
on
the
motion
for
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
inquiry
made
by
defendant's
counsel
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
you
just
said
that
there
was
an
opportunity
to
question
the
jury
on
a
motion
for
new
trial.
now
was
there
or
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
juror
--
the
jurors
could
have
been
subpoenaed
and
they
could
have
been
questioned.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
three
were
in
fact
subpoenaed
but
did
not
testify.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
all
of
this
in
the
record
of
the
habeas
hearing,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
does
the
state
--
did
the
state
accept
those
statements
without
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
they
--
how
come
they're
in
the
record
if
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
were
the
witnesses
called?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
over
the
objection
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
apiece
on
each
side
was
not
used,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
in
the
record
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
an
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
an
argument
mr.
corrigan?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
these
briefs?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
oral
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
corrigan,
one
more
question.
what
would
be
your
view
if
--
if
the
evidence
were
quite
clear
that
the
trial
judge
had
remark
from
miss
kilgallen
that
he
believe
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
and
that
he
had
said
to
a
court
officer
that
he
believed
the
defendant
was
guilty
and
he
went
right
ahead
and
tried
the
case.
what
do
you
think
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
we
believe
that
the
judge
did
say
that,
you
would
say
we
should
reverse
this,
that
we
could
set
this
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
reaches
any
constitutional
dimensions.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
reaches
any
constitutional
dimension?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
suggestion
mr.
corrigan
if
miss
kilgallen
did
have
this
interview
with
the
judge
before
that
time
that
anybody
knew
anything
about
that
before
the
occasion
long
after
the
trial
when
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
the
assistant
to
mr.
corrigan.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
--
and
he
is
since
deceased
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
