mr.
john
t.
corrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
may
i
address
my
remarks
to
some
of
the
statements
heretofore
made
to
this
court.
one
was
regarding
the
question
of
photographs
in
the
courtroom.
judge
blythin
of
the
outset
had
instructed
counsel
on
both
sides
that
he
would
permit
photographs
to
be
taken
when
the
court
was
not
in
session,
provided
that
the
taking
of
the
photographs
was
without
objection.
a
substantial
number
of
photographs
were
taken
of
the
counsel
for
the
defense
and
the
defendant
and
it
was
not
until
many
days
had
passed
and
many
photographs
had
been
taken
that
objection
was
made
and
when
the
objection
was
made
then
of
course
no
photographs
were
taken
thereafter.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
sequestering
of
a
jury,
the
practice
in
ohio
has
been
that
unless
and
until
a
case
is
presented
for
deliberation,
the
jury
is
not
sequestered.
in
the
last
session
of
the
legislature,
this
was
changed
so
as
to
provide
for
a
sequestering
of
the
jury
throughout
the
entire
trial
in
the
instance
of
a
first-degree
murder
case.
with
regard
to
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
it
was.
it
was
not
the
usual
practice.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct
sir.
on
occasions
it
was
and
it
was
a
rare
occasion
that
a
jury
would
ever
be
sequestered
throughout
the
entire
trial
even
in
a
first-degree
murder
case.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
for
the
last
ten
years
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
practice
was
not
to
ask.
the
practice
would
be
by
a
motion
on
part
of
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
ten
years
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
sir
and
there
has
no
been
--
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
been
no
motion
to
sequester
a
jury
during
that
ten-year
period.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
sir,
not
during
that
time.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
beg
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
gentlemen,
the
issues
before
this
court
as
i
see
them
are
those
upon
which
the
district
court
had
predicated
its
decision
and
there
are
four
separate
issues.
one,
the
newspaper
publicity
before
and
during
the
trial,
pardon
me,
which
was
assigned
as
error
in
the
original
appeal.
secondly,
the
issue
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
disqualified
himself
because
of
prejudice,
this
was
not
assigned
as
error.
thirdly,
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
refused
to
submit
to
a
lie
detector
test,
this
was
not
assigned
as
error
in
the
trial
court
although
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
although
it
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court.
and
fourthly
that
the
bail
in
charge
of
the
jury
after
the
case
was
submitted
to
it
improperly
allowed
individual
jurors
to
make
telephone
calls
to
their
families.
with
regard
to
issue
number
one,
the
newspaper
publicity
before
and
during
the
trial,
the
district
court's
decision
i
believe
is
somewhat
equated
with
the
case
of
irvin
versus
dowd
and
rideau
versus
louisiana,
the
facts
of
which
i
will
not
repeat
here
for
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
facts
in
those
instances.
it
is
significant
however
to
point
out
that
in
the
irvin
versus
dowd
case,
the
prosecutor
and
police
officers
issued
press
releases
stating
that
the
defendant
had
confessed
to
six
murders.
this
is
not
the
case
here.
there
was
no
press
releases,
no
statements
made
relative
to
a
confession
of
any
sort.
and
at
the
trial
in
that
instances
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
sir.
in
that
instance,
the
jury
panel
consisted
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
sir.
there
were
no
announcements
made
to
that
effect.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
there
may
have
been
some
statements
made
in
response
to
questions,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
record
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
from
the
defendant.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
the
record
has
replete
with
instances
wherein
the
defendant
was
proclaiming
his
innocence
and
members
of
his
family.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct
sir
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
connection
with
that,
i
might
point
out
that
regarding
the
inquest
he
appeared
voluntarily
as
a
witness
and
he
testified
voluntarily.
he
was
not
then
a
defendant
nor
was
he
charged.
and
with
regard
to
the
commotion
that
occurred
at
the
inquest,
it
occurred
because
defense
counsel
insisted
upon
participating
in
the
inquest
and
when
he
was
denied
this
opportunity,
then
he
walked
out
of
the
hearing
and
the
hearing
was
immediately
thereafter
--
it
immediately
ceased.
there
was
no
continued
hearing.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
and
the
coroner
denied
him
that
opportunity.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
is
the
press
normally
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
it
is,
however,
i
think
it
would
best
be
described
as
a
two
by
four
room.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
it's
of
no
consequence.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
--
a
portion
of
the
courthouse
was
made
available
to
the
representatives
of
the
press
for
their
use
and
it
was
a
relatively
small
area,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
in
the
courtroom,
the
judge
did
provide
for
places
where
the
press
representing
only
the
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
this
was
however
not
in
the
trial
area
but
beyond
the
trial
area.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
courtroom,
i
might
add,
at
best
will
accommodate
perhaps
30
or
40
people.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
don't
know
the
number,
i
would
say
that
a
substantial
number
were
press
representatives,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
don't
know
that
that
is
correct
sir,
but
if
it
is
one
half
of
one
wall,
this
would
be
one
half
of
the
available
space
in
any
event.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
right.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
family
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
true.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
don't
know
what
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
would
say
that
the
whole
courtroom
would
not
facilitate
more
than
this
group
of
people
in
this
immediate
here
and
approximately
half
of
that
was
the
press.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
--
a
picture
was
taken
of
the
jury
in
that
--
in
the
session
however.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
in
the
court
room,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir,
they
were
in
the
box.
a
comparison
between
the
irvin
versus
down
and
the
sheppard
case
reveals
that
in
the
dowd
case
there
were
430
persons
who
were
of
the
original
panel
whereas
there
were
75
in
the
sheppard
case
and
not
all
of
the
75
were
exhausted.
and
of
the
75,
11
of
them
were
immediately
excused
for
justifiable
reasons
or
were
not
found.
in
the
rideau
case,
the
court
conceded
or
considered
conceded
circumstances
and
that
was
on
the
voir
dire,
the
counsel
for
rideau
had
requested
the
certain
jurors
who
later
decided
the
case
be
excused
for
cause.
there
were
two
deputy
sheriffs
who
sat
on
that
jury.
no
such
incident
occurred
in
the
sheppard
case.
there
were
two
members
of
the
jury
or
three
members
of
the
jury
rather
who
had
convicted
whom
who
had
stated
on
voir
dire
that
they
had
seen
and
heard
rideau's
testimony
or
rideaus's
statement
televised
--
i
mean
television
station.
this
was
not
so
in
the
sheppard
case.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
in
sheppard
case?
no
sir.
some
of
them
had
denied.
some
of
them
had
admitted
that
they
have
read
something.
a
number
of
them
had
denied
and
those
that
have
made
admissions
as
to
having
read
something
had
indicated
that
they
were
able
to
put
out
of
their
mind
any
opinion
that
they
had
and
they
have
not
formulated
any
fixed
opinion
relative
to
the
guilt
or
the
innocence
of
this
defendant.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
what
was
that?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
your
honor,
on
one
day
the
defense
counsel
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
fact
that
winchell
had
made
a
statement
on
another
day
that
considine
have
made
a
statement.
now
with
regard
to
one
of
them
and
i
cannot
for
the
moment
tell
you
exactly
which
one,
the
court
then
questioned
the
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
any
of
the
jurors
have
heard
that
broadcast.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
one
of
the
jurors
had
indicated
that
they
have.
he
then
ask
whether
or
not
that
juror
would
still
follow
the
admonition
of
the
court
relative
to
predicating
his
decision
and
the
evidence
in
the
court
room
and
putting
out
of
his
mind
any
outside
influence.
this
juror
had
responded
to
the
court
that
while
he
heard
--
heard
on
the
radio,
he
did
not
listen
to
it.
now
in
a
subsequent
day
when
defense
counsel
called
the
other
broadcast
to
the
court's
attention,
the
court
said
this,
“i'm
not
going
to
question
the
jury.
i
am
going
to
again
admonish
them
as
i
have
each
time
that
we
have
come
into
session,
but
i'm
not
going
to
question
them
because
we
cannot
daily
badger
the
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
they
heard
or
they
read
something.”
and
if
you
will
please,
it
would
point
up
a
place
wherein
they
might
go
to
look
for
information
if
daily,
the
court
were
to
say,
did
you
read
this
in
the
cleveland
press?
did
you
read
this
in
the
cleveland
news
and
so
on?
i
submit
gentlemen
that
in
this
case
here,
we
have
on
trial
the
jury
system
in
the
united
states
and
i
am
going
to
permit
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
provide
a
time
after
trial
has
had
and
after
appeal
has
had,
and
pardon
me
of
the
use
of
the
vernacular,
but
are
we
going
to
permit
the
throwing
in
of
the
kitchen
sink
and
now
claim
that
the
defendant
was
denied
a
fair
trial
when
the
record
very
clearly
points
out
that
all
of
his
rights
were
afforded
him
by
an
unbiased
judge,
by
a
judge
that
had
ruled
in
a
manner
wherein
there
is
no
error
made
manifest
whatever
by
the
record,
by
a
jury
that
was
selected
by
competent
counsel
on
both
sides,
by
a
jury
that
was
subjected
to
a
voir
dire
examination
that
lasted
a
couple
of
weeks,
by
a
jury
that
subsequently
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
brought
back
and
questioned
again.
now
at
this
time,
the
defense
counsel
did
not
see
fit
to
point
out
that
this
juror
was
in
anyway
contaminated
or
prejudiced.
now
with
regard
to
the
statement
of
dorothy
kilgallen,
a
statement
of
a
dead
man,
a
hearsay
statement,
the
raucous
kind
of
evidence,
but
what
do
we
have
to
rebut
it?
we
have
the
statement
of
fred
garmone,
one
of
the
defense
counsel
who
in
a
deposition
hearing
said
that
he
was
satisfied
that
judge
blythin
was
in
no
way
prejudiced
or
whatever.
i
might
have
too
that
the
record
bear
out
that
judge
blythin
coincidentally
is
one
of
the
finer
judges
in
our
county
or
was.
the
record
points
out
that
judge
blythin
said
to
the
defense
counsel,
“if
you
have
any
idea
that
i
may
be
prejudiced
in
this
matter
in
any
way
whatever,
i
will
step
down.”
our
law
of
ohio
provides
that
defense
counsel
must
file
an
affidavit
of
prejudice
but
judge
blythin
in
this
instance,
indicated
that
that
wouldn't
be
necessary,
but
merely
upon
their
request,
he
would
step
down
and
not
hear
the
case.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
was
prompted
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
discussion
ahead
in
the
chambers
relative
to
judge
blythin
having
a
son
who
was
a
member
of
the
homicide
unit
of
the
cleveland
police
department.
his
son
incidentally
did
not
participate
in
this
investigation
in
any
manner
or
whatever
nor
did
he
appear
as
a
witness
and
was
in
no
way
afoul
and
it
was
this
discussion
prior
to
the
term
of
the
trial
that
prompted
the
court
to
indicate
to
the
defense
counsel
that
he
would
step
down.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
in
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
in
the
record
on
appeal
--
it
is
in
the
appeal
record,
it
is
not
in
the
trial
record
as
such.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
it
is
in
the
habeas
record,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
your
honor,
i
would
have
been
most
pleased
to
do
so.
however,
at
the
time
that
this
matter
came
before
the
federal
district
court
and
we
appeared
as
counsel,
the
judge
in
that
instance
said
to
us,
the
is
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
cuyahoga
county,
you
are
not
attorney
of
record.
we
made
an
oral
motion
to
be
admitted
and
he
denied
the
motion.
we
were
precluded
from
participating
in
the
habeas
corpus
matter
and
the
district
court
level
which
hearing
incidentally
was
in
private
and
not
a
public
hearing
at
any
time.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes.
it
was
a
private
hearing.
it
was
not
a
public
hearing
and
that
is
from
once
we
appeal
now
on
this
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
state
of
ohio
was
represented
by
the
attorney
general
because
the
action
is
the
petitioner
against
the
warden
and
the
warden
is
represented
by
the
attorney
general.
so
technically,
the
attorney
general
is
the
counsel
of
record
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
though
the
counsel
in
the
matter
on
trial
and
the
matter
on
appeal
was
not
technically
the
counsel
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct
sir
except
in
the
habeas
corpus
as
i
have
pointed
out
now.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
only
if
--
only
if
the
respondent
is
an
office
holder
represented
by
the
attorney
general.
let
us
assume
that
the
habeas
corpus
was
brought
against
the
sheriff
of
the
county.
i
represent
the
sheriff
as
the
district
attorney
on
my
district.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
so
that
i
would
then
be
here
on
a
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
but
one
brought
against
the
warden
would
involve
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
he
will
do
this
your
honor
if
the
court
permits
him
to
do
so
and
in
this
instance
where
we
ask
permission,
the
court
denied
us
permission
to
participate.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
did
who?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
attorney
general
was
most
welcomed
to
have
us
come
in.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
would
only
have
to
read
his
mind
your
honor.
i
have
no
reason
to
know
or
believe
as
to
why
the
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
reason
whatever,
but
he
flatly
denied
and
said
that
you
will
not
be
permitted
to
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
where
could
you
find
that
in
the
record?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
don't
know
that
the
transcript
was
made
of
that
particular
statement
your
honor,
but
i
can
vouch
for
it
and
certainly
the
attorney
general
who
was
present
there
can
vouch
for
it.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
don't
know
that
it
is
not
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
i
do
not.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
right.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
this
again
i
do
not
know.
the
district
judge
conducted
his
findings
in
his
chambers
or
in
[inaudible]
public.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
your
honor,
there
was
an
agreed
--
of
stipulation
between
the
attorney
general
and
the
counsel
representing
the
petitioner.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
on
the
stipulation
of
facts,
i
must
agree
with
the
court
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
--
and
such.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
there
were
briefs
filed,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
was
not
there
your
honor.
i
cannot
answer
that
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
they
were
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
well,
it
was
secret
in
the
sense
that
it
was
not
public
in
that
there
were
not
witnesses
produced.
there
was
not
evidence
tendered
in
open
court.
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
certainly
don't
doubt
that
for
a
moment
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
we
are
not
related
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
we're
distant
relatives.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
there's
a
lot
of
corrigans
cuyahoga
county.
thank
you.[laughter]
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
certainly,
i
believe
that
if
the
attending
judge
at
this
preconceived
opinion,
he
should
disqualify
himself
and
if
he
failed
to
do
so,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
his
preconceived
opinion
and
idea
would
someway,
somehow
creeped
into
the
record
(voice
overlap)
that
will
affect
his
judgment.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
don't
think
that
it
is
a
constitutional
question.
i
think
that
it
is
a
question
that
might
be
reviewed
an
error
for
an
appeal
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no,
i
do
not.
but
in
any
event,
i
can
say
that
on
the
record,
we
will
not
find
that
judge
blythin
was
biased
or
prejudiced
in
any
way
and
i
can
say
to
this
court
which
of
course
--
what
are
we
doing
here,
we
are
equating
the
statement
of
dorothy
kilgallen
with
the
reputation
of
a
judge,
with
the
statement
by
defense
counsel
garmone
to
the
effect
that
he
was
satisfied
that
he
was
in
prejudice
with
the
fact
the
people
have
tried
the
case,
the
defense
counsel
never
raised
this
issue
and
the
first
time
it
comes
before
this
court
is
ten
years
later
on
an
unsworn
statement,
statement
that's
undoubtedly
made
and
one
which
could
not
be
rebutted
because
of
the
death
of
a
man
that
presumably
made
the
statement.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
suggestion
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
he
did
it
when
he's
asked
to
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
mr.
murray
was
a
court
attaché.
we
have
23
judges
on
the
common
pleas
court
in
cuyahoga
county.
mr.
murray
worked
for
the
judges
and
one
day
might
be
working
for
one
judge
and
another
day
for
another
judge
depending
upon
what
room
they
were
seated
in
a
particular
time.
and
he
worked
in
what
was
known
as
room
1
where
they
pass
upon
motions
generally
and
hear
matter
in
equity
and
he
did
have
contact
with
judge
blythin.
and
again,
it
was
some
eight
or
ten
years
later
that
mr.
murray
made
this
statement
that
some
several
months
before
the
trial
in
a
general
discussion,
judge
blythin
made
a
remark
something
to
the
effect
that
he
believed
that
sheppard
was
guilty.
murray
went
further
however
and
murray
said
that
there
were
other
people
present.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
but
he
couldn't
remember
who
the
other
people
were.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
and
i
might
further
point
out
and
this
is
common
knowledge
that
mr.
murray
had
been
previously
operated
on
by
one
of
the
doctors
in
the
sheppard
family
and
murray's
son
is
an
osteopathic
physician
who
has
worked
out
of
the
bay
view
hospital.
i
think
that
without
attacking
his
credibility
here,
i
think
that
we
can
say
certainly
that
this
shows
that
he
had
an
interest
in
this
matter.
