l.
black
was
the
motion
made
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
a
legislative
or
judicial
function?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
rules,
establishment
of
rules
–
ed
with
a
group.
justice
hugo
l.
black
–
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
you
would
say
it's
not
a
legislative
function?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
we
don't
have
to
determine
whether
that
was
right
or
wrong
in
this
case.[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it?
during
or
after
the
trial
she
said
--
he
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
--
he
was
the
trial
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
take
part
to
judge
in?
are
you
a
part
of
judge,
you
went
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
didn't
question
miss
kilgallen?
your
man
never
asked
for
any
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
why
--
why
do
you
say
that
he
did
if
you
couldn't
presume
they
would
offer
that
in
evidence
(voice
overlap)
going
to
ask
you
to
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not
if
there
was
no
objection
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
object
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
did
the
judge
say
when
you
objected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
he
used
it
in
making
his
decision
in
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
it
was
offered,
was
accepted
and
it
was
a
part
of
the
basis
of
the
district
judge's
holding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
didn't
read
what
he
said
--
what
was
said?
is
that
--
did
you
read
all
that
was
said
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
it
pointed
it
out
to
you,
would
you
mind
reading
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
asked
her?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
say
that?
is
there
any
dispute
that
she
said
that
she
said
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
does
that
really
make
any
difference
if
it's
in
the
record
and
the
judge
accepts
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
for
one
other
question
because
i
think
probably
just
to
the
--
i
have
a
difficulty
in
[inaudible].
let's
suppose
that
it
had
been
shown
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
beyond
any
shadow
of
a
doubt
by
evidence
it
could
not
possibly
refused,
but
the
court
had
found
during
the
trial,
the
trial
judge
did
make
a
statement
that
is
attributed
to
him
as
he
is
as
guilty
as
hell.
would
you
say
that
that
was
a
part
that
would
justify
any
action
on
our
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
would
it
have
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
--
i
thought
that
was
really
the
trouble.
are
you
saying
that
after
a
person
has
been
convicted,
if
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
was
found
and
it's
proven
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt,
he
was
tried
by
prejudiced
by
the
judge
who
believed
he
was
guilty
and
ordered
him
found
guilty.
are
you
saying
that
that
have
to
stand
as
--
because
it's
not
brought
up
when
the
lady
has
spoken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
argument
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
that
what
you
think
is
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
heard
the
case
of
tumey
against
ohio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
hold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judgment
was
set
aside
was
it
not
on
the
ground
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
city
of
built-in
prejudice
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
instead
of
having
a
built-in
prejudice,
you
know
that
he
was
prejudiced
because
he
said
he
was
prejudiced.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
were
saying
there
was
that
the
situation
showed
that
he
had
to
be
prejudice
or
going
to
assume
his
prejudice.
now
let's
say
that
they
didn't
have
to
assume
it.
they
proved
it
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
what
should
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
but
you
shouldn't
take
his
thought
if
you
said
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
they
claim
if
they
want
to
look
at
what
he
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
had
been
determined
that
he
was
guilty
but
he
was
not
when
he
did
it,
what
degree
of
murder
would
that
had
been?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
no
effect
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
is
so
drunk
and
you
couldn't
premeditate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
he
found
guilty
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
cuyahoga
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
the
practice
of
the
attorneys
to
ask
it
and
get
refused
or
was
this
done
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
have
you
been
a
prosecuting
attorney?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
during
that
time
was
it
customary
for
lawyers
to
ask
for
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
ask
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
da
make
any
informal
announcements?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
to
any
effect
with
regard
to
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
questions
in
the
news
reporters
--
questions
of
the
reporters.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
place
that
you
had
there
for
the
press
is
larger
than
the
place
over
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
your
place
or
space
you
had
with
the
press
is
larger
as
the
space
over
there
and
here
that
the
press
has
occupied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
mechanical
recording
of
the
testimony
or
any
part
of
the
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
taping
or
mechanical
recording
of
any
of
the
proceedings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
judge
say
the
reason
he
would
not
let
you
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
not
give
you
the
reason
or
did
he
give
any
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
enter
the
trial
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
in
the
record?
where
is
that
in
your
--
where
can
we
find
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
with
that
but
i
didn't
have
or
not
to
be
in
this
record
if
it
is
so
the
three-volume
typewritten
record.
how
did
you
have
and
not
to
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
simply
say
that
on
your
request
by
the
attorney
general
agreed
to
a
district
judge
declined
to
let
you
represent
the
state
--

and
be
in
the
courtroom.
