chief

samuel
h.
sheppard,
petitioner
versus
e.
l.
maxwell,
warden.
mr.
bailey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
about
whether
this
form
was
a
human
being
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
a
man
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
ever
find
the
t-shirt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
little
village
in
the
same
county
as
cleveland?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
objection
to
that
particular
editorial
which
calls
upon
him
to
have
an
inquest
following
a
murder?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
all
of
it
been
--
have
been
presented
at
the
petition
--
original
petition
for
certiorari?
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
question
was
could
all
of
it
have
been
presented?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
wasn't,
just
wasn't
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
die
before
the
petition
was
filed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
mr.
bailey
that
you
--
it's
your
position
that
the
inquest
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
dr.
sheppard
to
testify
against
himself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
counsel
ejected
from
the
inquest
room
because
he
was
a
lawyer
and
they're
representing
a
defendant
or
because
of
conduct
that
was
complained
of
by
the
coroner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
his
conclusion
about
that
at
the
inquest?
did
he
--
did
he
--
it
was
committed
by
unknown
persons
or
--
or
did
he
absolve
the
doctor
or
what
did
the
coroner
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
completed
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
continue
--
continue
for
further
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
before
--
with
what
you're
reading
now
before
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
the
only
part
of
the
record,
is
it?
is
that
a
part
of
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
mr.
bailey,
by
your
last
statement,
do
you
mean
that
you're
not
pressing
the
point
with
respect
to
assertedly
excessive
or
prejudicial
newspaper
publicity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
--
even
in
a
large
city
like
cleveland
isn't
in
murder
cases
is
in
the
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
berkman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
because
of
the
choice
of
counsel
or
the
ruling
of
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
is
--
as
to
whether
the
jurors
would
be
questioned
about
whether
they
have
these
things
or
what
affected
the
verdict.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
berkman,
aren't
you
going
to
detail
to
us,
pardon
me,
what
the
court
should
have
done
in
this
case
to
keep
and
--
what
it
didn't
do
to
keep
this
publicity
from
the
jury.
i
think
that's
quite
--
i
would
think
that
would
be
quite
essential
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
jury
never
heard
of
this,
if
they
never
read
any
of
those
items
that
didn't
come
to
their
attention,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now
what
--
what
should
the
judge
have
done
which
he
didn't
do
that
makes
this
an
unfair
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
county
in
ohio
would
have
been
remote
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that's
a
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
has
the
right
to
say
where
he'll
be
tried?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
in
those
circumstances,
we'd
have
to
say
today
where
we
have
so
many
news
media,
the
television,
the
radio,
newspapers
that
no
trial
could
be
had
in
a
big
city
if
the
defendant
wanted
to
go
to
some
place
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
are
going
to
--
you
are
going
to
tell
us
first
what
the
judge
didn't
do
to
make
this
an
unfair
trial
actually.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
we
have
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
change
of
venue,
yes.
now
what
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
i
ask
if
that
is
all
you
complain
about
so
far
as
the
action
the
judge
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
argue
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
argue
it,
they're
not
as
important
to
argue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
saxbe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
were
not
affidavits.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
was
the
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
hear
you.
i
didn't
hear
it.
she
was
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
you
object
to
it
if
this
was
unsworn?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
why
would
your
man
agree
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
offered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
the
circumstances
of
this
kilgallen
statement?
i
take
that
that
was
just
pointed
out
to
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
now
you
say
that
it
was
brought
in,
how
was
it
brought
in?
that's
what
we
want
to
know
--
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
--
didn't
you
have
a
man
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
was
the
purpose
of
you
going
there
if
you
didn't
propose
to
test
the
truth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
stay
with
this
--
let's
stay
with
this
for
just
a
minute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
objection
did
you
make
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
use
of
this
at
the
--
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
objection
did
you
make
at
this
habeas
corpus
hearing
to
the
use
of
this
statement
of
dorothy
kilgallen
by
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
--
is
the
record
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
53
or
63?
chief
justice
earl
warren
look,
i
see
what
close
that
book.
what
i'm
interested
in
is
how
this
got
into
the
record?
what
did
the
--
where
was
it
offered
and
what
did
the
judge
say
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
let's
just
--
let's
still
get
away
from
this
quite
yet.
i
like
to
know
if
those
two
blue
bound
books
that
you
have
just
been
using
are
a
part
of
the
record
of
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
in
the
record
of
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
no
part
of
it
could
be
the
entire
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
why
do
you
say
to
us
if
it's
in
that
record
that
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
--
did
you
ever
point
out
to
us
in
your
briefs
that
--
that
this
was
not
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
point
it
out
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
not
talking
about
that
record.
we're
talking
about
what
we
have
before
us
and
on
which
we
must
decide
this
case.
is
there
anything
in
your
record
here
in
your
brief
or
in
your
response
to
the
petitioner
that
shows
that
this
statement
was
not
before
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
abandon
that
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
use
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
in
what
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
put
in
any
--
anything
to
combat
this
statement
of
murray's
and
dorothy
kilgallen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
absolute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
from
the
record
that
they're
permitted
to
call
home
and
talk
to
the
relatives
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
wasn't
i
was
talking
about.
you
said
it
was
absolute
but
it
wasn't
absolute,
was
it?
they
were
permitted
--
they're
permitted
while
they're
deliberating
on
the
case
to
telephone
out
and
telephones
with
their
homes
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
none
have
been
sequestered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
the
exculpatory
statements
of
the
defendant
publicized?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
they
did
get
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
did
they
get
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
the
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
himself
made
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
made
public
those
statements
that
were
made
to
the
authorities
and
that
were
eventually
in
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
read
it,
he
wanted
to
make
a
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
coroner
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
statement
was
that
there
is
only
one
half
of
one
row
that
would
just
normally
use
for
the
public
that
was
left
to
the
public,
all
the
rest
of
the
courtroom
have
names
on
the
seats
for
press
representatives,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
thought
that
the
last
row
or
one
of
the
rows
--
half
of
one
of
the
rows
was
reserved
for
the
members
of
the
family
of
the
victim.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
the
other
half
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
one
row
was
for
the
public
and
that's
the
only
part
of
it
that
was
open
to
the
general
public
that
all
the
rest
of
it
had
tags
on
it
for
specific
representatives
of
the
press,
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
going
to
refer
to
the
winchell
statement
over
the
radio
to
the
effect
that
dr.
sheppard
was
the
father
of
a
child
of
some
woman
who
was
in
jail
for
robbery.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
prompted
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
prompted
that
statement
from
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
been
wondering
why
if
you're
protecting
the
jury
system
here
and
protecting
the
integrity
of
a
deceased
judge
of
high
standing,
why
you
did
not
question
the
statement
of
dorothy
kilgallen
to
the
extent
of
cross-examining
her
as
to
which
--
as
to
the
truthfulness
of
it
and
to
the
extent
of
placing
her
under
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
habeas
corpus
matter
was
private?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
just
a
little
puzzled
by
your
system
there.
as
i
have
followed
it
through
the
years
whenever
ohio
is
in
the
court
on
a
criminal
case
here,
the
district's
attorney
of
the
county
where
the
case
was
tried
represents
him
not
to
â€“
represents
the
state
and
not
the
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
all
habeas
corpus
cases
the
attorney
general
represents.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
corrigan,
i
notice
back
that
your
name
is
the
same
as
the
man
who
defended
him,
is
that
pure
coincidence
or
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
not
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
have
an
idea
that
was
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
corrigan,
i
wonder
if
in
the
defense
of
a
habeas
corpus
judge
couldn't
be
said
that
the
attorney
general
of
a
state
chose
to
say
that
he
did
not
questioned
the
voracity
of
miss
kilgallen
because
of
her
eminence,
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
he
didn't
--
not
being
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
wouldn't
have
much
of
an
opportunity
to
determine
what
the
facts
are,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
corrigan.
mr.
bailey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
does
not
appear
in
dayton
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
have
the
right
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
affidavit
under
oath
(voice
overlap)what
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
what
is
your
answer
to
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general
that
defense
counsel
stated
to
the
court
and
i
think
he
said
it
was
in
the
record
that
he
did
not
challenge
the
fairness
or
the
bias
of
the
judge
in
any
way
shape
or
form.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
if
the
counsel
made
--
the
attorney
general
made
that
--
no,
your
defense
counsel
made
that
before
the
trial
or
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
made
no
such
statement
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
not
challenging
the
integrity
of
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
