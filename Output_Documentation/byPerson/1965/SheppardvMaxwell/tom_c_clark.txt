justice
tom
c.
clark
i
think
that
you're
not
raising
the
irvin
and
dowd
question.
justice
tom
c.
clark
to
be
carried
during
the
trial
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
who
subpoenaed
them
here,
defendant?
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
would
they
not
be
determined?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
wonder
why
the
counsel
hasn't,
if
this
was
so
important
as
it
wants
to
appear
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
why
wouldn't
the
experienced
counsel
ask
to
sequester
the
jury?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
is
that
a
real
problem
in
the
criminal
case
of
lengthy
time,
the
jurors
might
be
compelled
to
stand
out.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
a
problem
for
the
defendant
if
the
--
at
the
state
as
to
what
the
adverse
effect
it
might
have
on
the
jury
to
hold
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
have
any
statutes
in
the
records
to
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
are
you
going
into
that
evidence
(voice
overlap)
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
could
cross-examine
her
though
if
you
have
been
there.
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course
they
held
it
against
it.
they
said
it
was
in
the
record.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
could
require
her
to
be
in
the
court.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
could
have
required
her
to
be
either
under
oath
or
in
the
courthouse
at
the
trial.
justice
tom
c.
clark
getting
back
to
the
press
--
is
there
a
press
room
in
the
court
building?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
there
a
press
room
in
the
court
building?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
it
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
did
you
take
care
of
the
large
number
of
press
representatives?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
know
when
they
take
the
picture
of
the
juror
--
jurors,
the
jury?
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
the
court
room.
justice
tom
c.
clark
were
they
in
the
box?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
all
read
i
suppose
something
about
it
in
the
papers.
i
suppose
they'd
all
read
something
about
it
in
the
newspapers.
justice
tom
c.
clark
to
whom
did
he
permit
to
represent
the
state?
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
corrigan,
why
was
the
trial
in
camera?
you
said
the
trial
was
secret,
why
was
it
secret?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
all
submitted
on
stipulation
agreement?
justice
tom
c.
clark
there's
no
occasion
then
to
have
a
hearing
in
the
open
courts
if
it
was
all
on
agreement.
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
those
briefs
were
publicly
filed
were
they
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
there
anything
secret
about
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
anything
on
the
attack
on
his
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
far
it
is
agreed
that
miss
kilgallen
was
just
driving
the
statement.
so
if
it
had
testimony,
you
don't
doubt
what
the
judge
would
have
had
in
an
open
court
even.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
was
the
trial
on
the
merits
before
the
state,
the
defense
counsel
said
that
he
had
no
objection
to
the
judge.
