is
there
an
inference
that
there
was
more
than
one
person
if
he
was
grappling
with
the
--
this
form
as
you
call
it
and
was
struck
from
behind?
is
that
--
there
an
inference
if
there
were
two
people
there?
justice
potter
stewart
the
city
of
cleveland
didn't
have
a
juris
--
how
did
they
have
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
is
a
request
by
the
bay
village
police
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
said
mr.
attorney
general
and
now
i'm
reading
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
on
--
which
appears
on
s
34
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
court
of
appeals
says,
first
of
all
says,
the
district
judge
held
that
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
were
violated
because
the
trial
judge
failed
to
recuse
himself
sua
sponte
from
presiding
at
the
sheppard
trial.
the
basis
of
this
conclusion
was
some
pretrial
remarks
which
judge
blythin
has
alleged
to
have
made
indicating
his
belief
that
sheppard
was
guilty.
then
it
says,
the
material
from
which
this
finding
was
made
came
to
light
after
the
instant
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed.
there
was
put
in
evidence
a
statement
of
a
new
york
columnist,
one
dorothy
kilgallen
kumar
wherein
she
stated
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
she
was
invited
into
the
chambers
of
judge
blythin
and
there
told
of
the
judge's
belief
that
petitioner
was
guilty
as
hell
and
so
on.
so
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
unequivocally
stated
that
that
statement
was
put
in
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
hamilton
county,
ohio
a
different
part
of
the
state
to
be
sure,
things
might
have
changed
there.
it
is
my
distinct
recollection
that
in
a
first
degree
murder
case
it
was
almost
automatic
to
have
the
jury
sequestered.
it's
not
automatic.
it
was
the
usual
thing
to
do.
i
don't
remember
any
first
degree
murder
case
in
which
it
was
not
done.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
evidence
show
that
he
was
guilty
of
second-degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
really
no
evidence
of
second-degree
murder,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
cuyahoga
county?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
cuyahoga
county.

potter
