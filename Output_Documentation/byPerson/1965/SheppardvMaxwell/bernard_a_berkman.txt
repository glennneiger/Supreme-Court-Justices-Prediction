mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
problem
which
confronts
the
court
in
this
case
is
one
of
the
most
complex
and
serious
and
compelling
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
in
our
constitutional
law.
how
do
you
guarantee
an
accused
the
fair
trial
by
an
impartial
judge
and
an
uncontaminated
jury
in
the
context
of
contemporaneous,
detailed,
colorful
and
pervasive
crime
reporting
by
the
news
media.
how
do
you
keep
the
evidence
off
the
news
stand
and
in
the
courtroom
under
appropriate
due
process
safeguards
without
interfering
unduly
with
the
public's
right
to
know,
the
public's
right
to
be
informed
and
the
press'
right
to
print.
we
recently
add
tragic
evidence
of
the
need
to
solve
this
urgent
problem
and
to
solve
it
now.
the
experience
in
dallas,
the
warren
commission
has
reported,
is
a
dramatic
affirmation
of
the
need
for
steps
to
bring
about
a
proper
balance
between
the
right
of
the
public
to
be
kept
informed
and
the
right
of
the
individual
to
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
in
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
bridges
against
california
25
years
ago
and
continuing
up
at
least
through
wood
against
georgia
in
1962,
this
court
has
rejected
the
english
solution
which
subordinates
of
press
to
the
courts.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
has
put
it
in
a
law
review
article,
“we
have
concluded
that
a
free
press
has
the
same
dignity
as
an
independent
judiciary.
we
have
made
our
choice
refusing
to
sacrifice
freedom
of
the
press
to
whims
of
judges,
for
we
know
that
judges
as
well
editors
can
be
tyrants.”
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
is
correct
that
the
impact
caused
by
the
material
which
appeared
in
the
press
before
and
during
the
trial
must
have
--
should
have
been
controlled
in
order
to
guarantee
a
fair
trial.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
what
i
merely
mean
to
suggest
mr.
justice
brennan
that
there
is
nothing
about
what
we
propose
which
would
in
anyway
inhibit
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
i
wish
to
make
that
point
in
advance
because
of
the
hue
and
cry
which
has
come
up
to
shackle
the
press
which
is
not
our
argument.
we
ask
the
court
today
to
hold
that
the
publicity
which
precedes
and
surrounds
notorious
criminal
trial
maybe
of
such
a
character
on
its
face
as
to
be
inherently
prejudicial
to
the
accused
whether
or
not
the
transcript
of
voir
dire
discloses
that
the
jurors
admitted
that
they
have
preconceptions
of
guilt
or
promised
to
be
impartial
whether
or
not
reports
of
confessions
of
the
accused
were
actually
published
and
whether
the
source
of
the
damaging
publicity
was
newspaper,
radio,
television
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
an
examination
of
the
voir
dire
will
indicate
that
there
is
not
--
the
intense
kind
of
material
as
appeared
in
the
record
in
irvin
against
dowd.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
the
transcript
does
not
indicate
that
the
individual
themselves
so
said.
there
are
a
couple
of
instances
of
rather
peculiar
performance
by
the
jurors
which
are
indicated.
one
of
them
a
recital
by
one
of
the
jurors
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
cleveland
newspapers
were
delivered
to
her
door
that
she
had
never
read
any
of
them.
and
another,
an
indication
by
somebody
who
--
as
soon
as
his
name
appeared
in
the
panel,
decided
that
he
would
read
every
particular
item
to
make
certain
that
he
would
be
able
to
be
qualified
to
be
the
juror.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
for
mistrial
or
new
trial
should
have
been
granted.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
there
was
no
request
to
sequester
the
jury.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
court
recognizing
the
kind
of
milieu
in
which
it
was
attempting
to
conduct
a
trial
might
very
suo
sponte
have
sequestered
the
jury
or
provided
some
other
means
of
protection,
but
it
did
not.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
at
the
time
it
became
clear
that
a
walter
winchell
radio
program
describing
some
very
damaging
material
attacking
the
character
and
credibility
of
the
defendant
appeared.
there
could
have
been
control,
some
intense
questioning
imposed.
i
think
that
at
the
time
of
a
nationwide
broadcast
by
robert
considine
comparing
the
defendant
to
alger
hiss
with
respect
to
his
credibility,
there
could
have
been
some
direct
and
intensive
questioning
of
the
jury
and
perhaps
a
grant
of
mistrial
even
at
that
point.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
these
two
items
that
i
have
just
referred
to
mr.
justice
clark,
occurred
during
the
trial.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
believe
that
there
was
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
there
was
no
such
inquiry
made.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
you
mean
after
the
trial
was
over?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
there
were
three
people
on
the
subpoena
but
they
did
not
testify
and
i
do
not
know
the
reason.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
after
--
after
the
trial
was
over.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
i
do
not
know
the
reason
whey
they
did
not.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
so.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
don't
know.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
mr.
bailey
has
indicated
that
up
until
this
time
it
had
not
been
the
custom
to
sequester
juries.
it
may
very
well
had
been
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
was
going
to
be
a
lengthy
one,
defense
counsel
determined
as
a
matter
of
tactic
at
the
time
although
i
suggest
to
you
that
i'm
only
guessing
that
it
might
have
been
better
not
to
keep
the
jury
away
from
their
families
in
order
to
attempt
to
have
them
be
more
minimal
to
listening
to
the
evidence.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
only
speculate.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
it
is
an
extensive
problem.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that
in
itself
it
might
be
prejudicial
your
honor.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
describe
in
detail
for
those
who
are
concerned
with
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
future
cases,
the
nature
of
the
publicity
to
describe
it
with
particularity,
the
kind
of
publicity
which
will
be
held
to
be
inherently
prejudicial,
insofar
as
the
facts
of
this
case
will
permit.
and
we
ask
further
that
the
court
articulate
detailed
guidelines
of
the
trial
court's
affirmative
responsibility
toward
the
accused
under
circumstances
where
he
alone
stands
between
the
massive
publicity
and
due
process
for
the
accused
and
one
point
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
letting
a
presumption
substitute
for
actual
proof.
actually,
this
is
a
question
of
which
of
several
presumptions
will
be
indulged
by
the
court.
will
it
be
the
presumption
that
a
jury
which
asserts
impartiality
on
voir
dire
is
not
prejudiced,
no
matter
what
kind
of
damaging
publicity
can
be
shown
objectively
or
will
it
be
that
presumption
that
given
the
kind
of
accusatory
and
damaging
publicity
in
this
case,
our
criminal
trial
was
contaminated
by
due
process
standards.
i
think
that
a
selection
of
one
presumption
or
another
is
an
absolute
essential
in
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that's
quite
true.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
at
the
outset,
a
motion
was
filed
by
the
defense
counsel
for
either
a
continuance
until
the
publicity
would
have
an
opportunity
to
die
down
or
for
a
change
of
venue
to
a
remote
county
in
ohio
where
perhaps
the
pressures
engendered
by
the
newspaper
publicity
in
a
prosecution
feeding
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well
i
admit
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
this
would
have
been
a
problem,
but
it
seem
to
us
that
since
the
defendant
who
is
actually
taking
the
risk
and
was
on
trial
and
made
the
request
for
a
continuance,
the
thing
that
confronted
the
judge
was
whether
or
not
the
individual
could
get
a
fair
trial
in
this
particular
county.
and
as
far
as
speculating
as
to
what
county
he
could
have
gotten
a
fair
trial
and
this
was
the
charge
to
the
defendant
at
least
if
he
waived
his
right
to
be
tried
in
the
county
in
which
the
crime
allegedly
took
place,
it
would
seem
to
us
at
least
he
ought
to
have
the
right
to
make
the
selection
under
the
conditions
that
prevailed
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
a
change
of
(voice
overlap)
environment.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
a
situation
where
there's
massive
publicity
throughout
the
nation
as
in
this
case,
the
way
in
which
a
court
may
attempt
to
escape
its
constitutional
responsibility
to
provide
a
fair
trial
is
to
say
that
there
isn't
a
county
in
which
the
case
might
have
been
tried.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
question
that
need
not
be
asked
when
a
defendant
himself
has
moved
to
have
a
change
of
venue.
i
think
that
under
appropriate
circumstances,
the
venue
might
necessarily
be
changed
several
times
as
this
court
found
it
necessary
to
do
in
irvin
against
dowd.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
beg
your
pardon?
the
present
situation
is
that
the
matter
of
--
or
a
change
of
venue
is
a
matter
solely
within
the
discretion
of
the
court,
your
honor.
and
we
submit
that
there
are
some
circumstances
such
as
the
instant
case
in
which
this
is
not
the
kind
of
protection
which
is
sufficient.
i
think
that
to
leave
the
matter
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
is
not
a
sufficient
answer.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
quality
of
the
newspaper
publicity.
we
don't
suggest
that
every
notorious
trial
is
per
se
a
denial
of
due
process
just
because
there
happens
to
be
a
lot
of
publicity.
that
isn't
the
point.
what
we've
tried
to
suggest
in
our
amicus
brief
is
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
publicity
which
by
their
very
nature
are
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
if
they
appear
in
a
particular
case
that
under
such
circumstances
a
continuance
or
a
change
of
venue
or
some
other
protection
by
the
court
ought
to
be
granted.
we
suggest
for
example
that
where
--
as
here,
the
prosecution
has
induced
to
cooperative
in
the
trial
by
newspaper
which
has
occurred
here
and
which
is
a
matter
of
record
that
under
those
circumstances,
word
can
be
demonstrated
as
clearly
as
we
can
demonstrate
here
that
the
prosecution
actually
attempted
to
create
the
atmosphere
which
is
presently
before
this
court.
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
we
suggest
that
the
judge
should
have
granted
a
continuance.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
or
a
change
of
venue.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
think
also
that
after
the
material
appeared
in
this
trial,
the
walter
winchell
report,
the
robert
considine
and
this
type
of
material,
the
court
should
have
granted
a
mistrial
on
the
basis
of
this
material
alone.
the
court
should
have
our
biggest
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
oh
yes
sir.
oh
yes,
the
record
shows
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes.
the
record
shows
that
motions
for
change
of
venue
and
continuance
in
mistrial
were
made
through
(voice
overlap)
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
myes
sir.
yes
sir
it
was.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes
sir,
yes.
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
deal
with
the
--
one
of
the
particular
kinds
of
publicity
which
we
think
is
inherently
prejudicial
and
which
this
court
are
to
announce
for
future
cases.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
this
is
clearly
a
judicial
function
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
i
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
would
say
that
in
this
particular
instance
after
this
court
has
dealt
in
rideau
and
in
irvin
and
some
of
these
other
cases
with
the
consequences
of
free
speech
upon
a
trial
situation
that
the
refinement
of
the
rules
and
the
articulating
of
them
beyond
the
particular
facts
of
the
--
of
those
cases
is
clearly
in
line
with
the
continuance
of
a
project
which
i
think
this
court
has
already
undertaken.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
moment
on
the
problem
of
the
kind
of
publicity
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities.
the
record
here
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
in
this
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
has
outlined
approximately
seven
items
which
this
court
may,
must,
might
have
done
in
order
to
assist
in
protecting
this
jury
against
the
consequences
of
the
material.
we
claim
all
of
those
and
principally
the
ones
that
we've
already
discussed.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
they
are
your
honor
and
if
i
had
time,
i
would
be
happy
to
do
it.
we
would
like
to
rely
on
the
arguments
which
are
made
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
which
argued
them
as
vigorously
as
we
can
in
print.
