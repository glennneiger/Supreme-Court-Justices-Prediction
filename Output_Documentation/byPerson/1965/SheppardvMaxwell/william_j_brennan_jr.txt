mr.
bailey,
i
gather
that's
the
editorial
quit
stalling,
bring
him
in,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
was
--
among
the
motions
after
trial
itself,
addressed
to
excessive
publicity.
was
--
were
those
editorials,
you
have
them
relied
upon
--
i'm
speaking
of
the
trial
now
and
not
of
federal
habeas
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
whether
these
are
among
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
all
of
these
exhibits
or
exhibits
which
were
introduced
at
the
habeas
hearing,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
fair
to
say
then
that
the
record
on
the
habeas
hearing
is
quite
a
different
one
on
the
record
at
the
trial
itself
adjust
to
the
excessive
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
any
idea
what
was
before
us
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
way
the
record
is
put.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
i'm
speaking
of
is
the
direct
review
petitioned
back
in
‘56.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
most
of
the
material
it
is
now
here
a
habeas
hearing
was
also
before
us
in
‘56.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
significant
difference
between
what
he
relied
on
in
1956
when
he
came
here
in
which
he
rely
on
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
there
any
issues
raised
here
that
were
not
raised
in
the
petition
in
1956?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
are
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
is
evidence
taken
on
that
issue
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
the
habeas.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
he's
now
dead
is
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
was
at
the
time
of
that
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
there
were
at
least
no
records
made
on
either
of
those
issues
on
the
application
for
direct
review
in
1956?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
jury
was
not
sequestered.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
a
motion
made
with
sequester
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
testify?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
make
this
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let's
see
then,
i
want
to
get
this.
i
understood
mr.
bailey
to
say
that
they're
not
--
you're
not
pressing
the
issue
of
unfairness
merely
because
of
publicity
but
rather
unfairness
because
there
was
this
excessive
publicity
and
no
steps
were
taken
by
the
trial
judge
or
by
the
prosecutor
to
arrest
its
possible
impact
on
jury,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
--
is
that
the
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
easier
to
say
i
take
it
that
there
is
none
in
this
record
the
kind
of
evidence
that
there
was
in
irvin
and
dowd
namely
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
–
the
jurors
conceding
of
their
prejudgment
of
the
trial
before
the
trial
began.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
more
particularly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there's
no
evidence
here
that
the
jurors
reacted
as
there
--
as
there
was
in
irvin
and
dowd
affirmative
evidence
of
how
they
reacted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
argument
i
gather
is
that
the
--
on
the
record
here,
at
least
the
publicity
at
that
kind
of
potential
for
prejudice
that
either
the
motion
for
continuance,
the
motion
for
change
of
venue,
what
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
about
sequestering
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
other
controls
that
you
suggest
in
the
context
of
this
record
that
has
been
applied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
the
motion
based
on
the
winchell
broadcast
not
only
for
a
mistrial
but
alternatively
for
instructions
to
the
jury
and
the
instructions
were
denied,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
this
is
here
on
a
different
set
of
facts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
get
that
from
the
answer
to
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
in
the
habeas
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
--
it's
not
an
exhibit
in
the
habeas
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
tried
when
the
habeas
proceeding
in
agreed
state
of
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
witnesses
--
no
witnesses
called?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
were
alleged
statements
by
the
trial
judge
deceased
at
the
time
of
the
habeas
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
she
was
so
eminent
a
person
that
he
was
opt
to,
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
the
judge
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
general,
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
it
was
an
unsworn
statement
by
agreement?
who
agrees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
but
certainly
he
admitted
it
for
the
purpose
of
the
record
in
this
habeas
proceeding,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
not
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
the
habeas
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
that
statement
--
the
habeas
record
is
not
printed.
at
least
i
don't
have
it
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
mr.
attorney
general
i
simply
can't
understand
that.
i
just
don't
understand
that.
what
do
you
mean
it's
not
part
of
the
record
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
said
specifically
about
the
kilgallen
statement
mr.
attorney
general?
don't
you
have
it
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
it
is
(voice
overlap).
it's
been
typed
in
the
record.
is
there
before
it
appears
anything
by
you
objecting
to
its
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
actually
testify?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
what's
your
ohio
practice
about
sequestering
juries
in
cases
like
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
--
when
it
is
--
how
is
it
brought
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
any
announcement
of
one
if
there
wasn't
any?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
could
there
be
announcement
of
one
if
there
wasn't
any?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
place
cards
didn't
they
in
the
courtroom
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
(voice
overlap)
three
of
the
four
benches?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
inside
of
the
trial
area
was
a
long
table
behind
which
there
were
place
cards
for
various
members
of
the
press.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
35
of
them
were
press
representatives?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
the
attorney
general
even
in
the
proceedings
against
the
warden
sometimes
let
the
district
attorney
to
handle
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
attorney
general
wants
you
to
handle
the
habeas
corpus
and
not
himself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
attorney
general
want
you
to
handle
the
habeas
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
attorney
or
the
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
only
long
enough
to
ask
mr.
bailey
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
going
to
have
those
volumes
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
he
could
produce
miss
kilgallen
before
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
could
take
her
deposition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
agreed
you
could
accept
their
affidavit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
any
other
mutually
satisfactory
arrangement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
what
are
you
going
to
tell
us
that
you
and
the
attorney
general
then
agreed
on
taking
the
statement
the
way
you
did
take
it?
