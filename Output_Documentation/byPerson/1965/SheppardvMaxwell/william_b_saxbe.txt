mr.
william
b.
saxbe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
some
45
years
ago,
there
was
a
murder
in
massachusetts.
there
were
two
men
charged
on
that,
mr.
sacco
and
mr.
vanzetti.
the
evidence
indicated
that
they
were
guilty
and
the
jury
so
found
them.
but
from
that
trial
there
came
and
from
he
defendant's
brief
in
that
trial
came
a
story
that
has
persisted
through
two
generations
of
bleeding
hearts
that
they
were
persecuted
because
they
were
anarchists,
because
they
were
italians,
because
they
were
draft
dodgers
and
that
the
fact
they
were
guilty,
never
entered
the
thing.
just
last
week,
a
new
book
came
out
where
they
reexamined
the
evidence
and
they
found
it
conclusive
that
they
were
guilty,
sacco's
gun
fired
the
bullet
--
fired
the
bullet
and
yet
so
eminent
the
jurist
as
justice
frankfurter
once
wrote
a
book
on
this
and
used
the
defendant's
brief
for
most
of
the
facts.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no
sir,
the
reason
i
bring
this
up
is
because
this
case
is
back
here
for
a
second
time
and
it's
back
here
not
on
any
different
arguments,
not
on
any
points
that
were
not
raised
in
1956,
but
if
you
please
on
a
different
set
of
facts.
it's
not
very
common
that
facts
are
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
according
to
the
defendant's
petition
and
the
defendant's
brief.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
will
call
it
to
your
attention.
the
things
that
he
has
raised
in
his
brief
and
the
statements
that
he
makes
do
not
come
from
the
record.
it
comes
from
fiction,
the
book.
it
comes
from
a
investigator,
originated
after
the
man
was
found
guilty
and
yes
it
comes
from
a
record
that
was
an
appendix
to
a
brief
which
was
this
book
that
he
referred
to.
but
to
get
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
in
the
record
of
the
habeas
hearings
your
honor
there
was
appended
to
the
defendant's
brief,
a
chapter
from
a
book
by
mr.
seltzer.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it
is
no
place
in
the
record.
it
was
not
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
in
the
habeas
proceedings.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it's
not
an
exhibit
in
the
habeas
proceedings
and
it's
not
in
an
agreed
part
of
the
facts
which
was
entered.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it
was
an
agreed
statement
of
facts,
yes.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
the
only
witnesses
that
were
called
is
two
persons
that
were
involved
in
the
prejudice
of
the
judge
which
the
district
judge
directed
that
the
statements
should
be
taken,
unsworn
statements
and
both
consider
the
judge
by
it
and
the
prejudice
the
man
had
been
dead
several
years,
obviously
an
extra
illegal
affair
which
had
never
has
entered
into
it.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes.
these
were
statements
by
dorothy
kilgallen,
and
a
courthouse
employee
which
had
to
do
with
statement
that
judge
blythin
had
made
before
this
trial
and
had
to
do
with
what
he
thought
the
defendant
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
the
state
does
not
accept
those
statements.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
we
objected
extraneously.
the
trial
judge
wanted
those
statements
and
did
rely
on
those
statements,
but
not
the
trial
judge
but
the
district
court
judge.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
witnesses
were
not
called.
there
was
no
cross-examination.
there
was
no
swearing.
these
were
voluntary
statements
which
the
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
one
was
an
affidavit
and
the
other
one
is
in
the
nature
of
a
deposition.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
the
affidavit
or
the
testimony
of
dorothy
kilgallen
was
taken
in
new
york.
i
had
to
represent
it
at
present.
it
was
an
unsworn
statement
by
agreement.
however
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
the
district
judge
said
that
she
was
so
eminent
a
person
that
she
need
not
be
sworn.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
she
was
not
sworn.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
because
the
district
judge
was
willing
to
accept
the
statement
unsworn
and
we
did
not
object
that.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
eminent.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
the
judge
said
that
at
that
time.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
at
that
time,
my
representative
went
to
new
york
with
mr.
bailey
to
take
the
statement
from
dorothy
kilgallen.
we
objected
that
the
statement
had
no
place
in
law.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
my
representative
at
that
time
agreed.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no.
but
the
judge
is
willing
to
accept
it.
i'm
not
finding
fault
with
the
judge
on
whether
or
not
it
was
sworn.
i
do
find
fault
with
the
fact
that
it
was
even
considered.
it
had
no
place
in
this.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
my
man
agreed
to
it
in
new
york
at
that
time.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
don't
know
but
it
[laughter]
--
that
was
what
he
came
back
and
said
that
they
had
no
one
to
take
the
statement
that
they
accepted
it,
but
this
is
not
in
the
record.
i
mean
this
statement
is
not
in
the
record.
it
is
in
the
judge
--
it
was
the
judge
accepted
the
statement
and
used
it
in
his
opinion
in
the
court
--
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
did
not.
it's
not
in
there.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
if
it
was
offered,
it
doesn't
show
on
the
record.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
the
habeas
record
is
here
in
this
court.
the
record
of
dorothy
kilgallen
does
not
show
in
this
record.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
we
have
it
here.
now
the
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
alright,
i'll
repeat
this
as
much
as
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
will
repeat
to
you
as
much
as
i
understand
about
the
statement.
some
number
of
years
after
the
trial,
she
was
at
a
cocktail
party
and
she
made
the
observation
that
judge
blythin
had
remarked
to
her
in
confidence
or
when
there
was
no
one
else
present
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
as
held.
that
was
the
statement.
she
never
indicated
that
this
was
reported
to
anybody
or
that
it
was
even
important.
the
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
said
--
he
said
it
--
that
he
said
it
before
the
trial
started.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
was
the
trial
judge.
she
said
nothing
about
this
and
years
later
she
made
this
observation
at
a
social
affair.
the
district
judge
thought
that
this
was
important
and
wanted
the
statement
taken.
this
was
recorded
as
information
that
was
available
to
him.
the
statement
came
in.
he
used
it
even
though
every
rule
of
law
would
preclude
a
dead
man's
statement
being
brought
in
or
without
cross-examination.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
the
district
judge
before
the
--
during
the
period
of
this
time
directed
that
they
go
to
new
york
and
take
the
statement,
that
a
representative
from
my
office
and
a
representative
from
the
defendant's
or
the
petitioner
go
and
take
the
statement.
it
was
--
it
came
back
as
an
unsworn
statement
and
it
was
relied
upon.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
did
not.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
because
there
was
no
one
to
swear
and
then
they
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
because
it
was
an
unsworn
statement
without
the
benefit
of
a
notary
or
any
person
authorized
to
make
a
deposition.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
well,
i
think
one
of
the
main
reasons
we
couldn't
presume
that
such
a
statement
could
possibly
get
into
the
record
and
i
imagine
that
that
was
the
reason.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
because
we
are
directed
by
the
judge.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no.
not
at
that
time
because
it
was
a
statement,
a
short
statement
which
she
simply
said
that
she
had
met
the
judge
in
the
chambers
or
there
about
saying
and
he
said
that
this
man
was
guilty
as
hell,
a
statement
which
every
other
part
of
the
record
denies.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
can
presume
that
they
were
offered
but
i
certainly
couldn't
presume
that
the
judge
would
accept
it
or
rely
on
it.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
well,
we
objected.
we
objected
to
the
introduction
but
we
did
not
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it
was
said
that
it
would
be
taken
under
consideration.
it's
not
our
objection.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it
is
not
in
the
record
of
this
case.
that's
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
we'll
find
that
where
the
mention
is
made
of
it
here.
in
the
meantime,
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
of
these
facts
that
have
to
do
with
the
(voice
overlap)
involved
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
alright.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
alright.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
we
objected
when
they
came
back
to
the
court
that
this
was
not
a
proper
part
of
the
habeas
proceedings.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
we
have
the
proceedings
here.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
on
6/3/64,
we
had
a
statement
of
f.
garmone
who
was
the
defense
attorney.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
64
--
6/3/54
--
june
the
6th
--
june
the
3rd.
we
have
a
statement
on
june
the
3rd,
1964
of
e.
murray.
e.
murray
is
the
court
employee
who
also
volunteered
a
statement
that
the
judge
has
indicated
his
prejudice
in
the
case.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
alright.
dorothy
k.
kumar,
220
south
street,
new
york,
may
9th,
1964.
mr.
bailey
questioned
her.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
said,
“your
name
is
dorothy
kilgallen?”
she
said,
“that's
correct”.
whom
are
you
employed
and
so
on?
and
other
asked
to
who
she
is
and
what
she
is.
“would
you
tell
us
when
you
started
to
cover
the
case?”
she
said,
“i
went
out
on
early
sunday
and
what's
--
after
what's
my
line
right
in
cleveland.
i
did
a
broadcast
in
my
husband's
station,
station
cleveland
and
new
york
and
then
i
went
to
the
courtroom.”
“was
impaneling
a
jury
going
on?”
“i
was
certainly
there
during
the
impaneling
of
the
jury,
it
was
monday.
the
trial
judge
edward
j.
blythin.”
“did
you
have
or
have
a
case
and
have
a
conversation
with
judge
blythin?”
“even
before
the
impaneling
of
jury
i
had
a
conversation
with
blythin.
they
arrived
in
the
court,
they're
rather
reporters
and
photographers.
as
soon
as
i
got
into
courtroom,
a
deputy
or
someone
conducted
with
judge
blythin
perhaps
the
secretary
who
i
got
to
know,
but
i
don't
recall
his
name,”
said
judge
blythin
likes
to
see
you
in
chambers?
“so
i
went
in
the
chambers,
that
where
i
met
judge
blythin.
“did
you
have
a
conversation?”
“yes.”
“what
happened
during
the
course?”
“he's
very
[inaudible]
i'm
sure
can.
i'm
glad
to
see.
i
watch
you
on
television.”
“but
why
come
all
this
way
to
new
york
to
cover
this
trial?”
all
he
said
it
says,
“all
the
ingredients
of
a
good
murder.
it
is
a
very
attractive
victim
who
was
pregnant.
the
accused
is
an
important
member
of
the
community
and
so
on
and
so
forth.”
and
judge
blythin
said,
“mystery.
it's
an
open
and
shut
case.”
what
do
i
mean?
i
was
going
to
take
in
the
back
because
usually
i've
talked
to
judges
but
don't
get
me
an
opinion.
“what
do
you
mean
judge
blythin?”
“well,
he
is
guilty
as
hell
and
there's
no
question
about
it.”
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no.
i
certainly
dispute
that
he
said
that.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
here
is
the
civil
docket
of
united
states
district
court
and
the
title
of
the
case
samuel
sheppard
versus
maxwell.
in
the
proceedings,
you
will
find
no
place
in
this
where
it
is
part
of
the
record.
that's
where
i
say
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no
sir
and
the
reason
or
i
would
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
--
say
the
reason.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
alright,
but
in
this
record,
it
got
in
there
because
the
judge
wanted
it
in
the
record.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
there
is
no
showing.
i
know
that
mr.
bailey
has
it
here.
i
don't.
there's
no
showing
that
it's
in
the
official
record.
we
raised
this
in
the
circuit
court
and
the
circuit
court
i
thought
handled
this
issue
very
adeptly.
in
other
words,
the
circuit
court
said
that
they
couldn't
count
on
such
a
thing
that
it
had
no
place
in
there
and
it
was
a
ridiculously
thing
to
be
involved
and
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
nonetheless,
it
is
not
in
the
proceeding
and
i
recognize
that
this
is
a
difficult
thing
to
talk
but
there's
a
lot
of
difficult
and
i
would
say
amazing
things
about
this
record
that
we
bring
to
you
here
today.
in
this
building,
there
is
this
record
which
composes
11,700
pages.
the
thing
that
i
am
interested
in
is
that
this
court
will
take
this
case
from
the
record
and
not
from
the
extraneous
material
which
is
attempted
to
be
introduced
in
the
state
which
mr.
bailey
made
here
today
and
with
the
statement
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
in
the
brief
to
accompany
to
him.
he
starts
right
off
with
a
statement
that
the
houks
were
called.
they
came
in
and
they
found
sheppard
lying
on
the
floor.
that
is
in
the
case.
the
record
will
show
that
he
was
seated
in
a
chair
and
that
he
gave
help
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
there
are
three
and
the
--
one,
two
and
three
in
the
circuit
--
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
circuit
court,
this
came
up
in
the
district
court
and
they
are
the
record
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
they're
the
record
of
this
case
but
not
the
entire
record.
this
is
only
the
habeas
corpus
record.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
simply
because
we
had
all
times
and
our
objection
felt
that
this
was
not
introduced.
and
our
index
in
volume
1,
the
proceedings
and
the
discussion
with
the
judge
indicated
that
it
was
not
to
be
part
of
the
record
when
this
comes
out,
it
is
part
and
that
it's
in
them
but
not
official.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it's
in
the
petition
to
the
--
or
in
the
--
our
petition
as
to
the
circuit
court
for
review.
we
point
out
in
there
that
in
this
proceedings
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
in
our
brief
to
the
circuit
court
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
which
bring
--
comes
up
here.
we
did
point
that
out
as
a
circuit
court.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
we
didn't
abandon
it.
we
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no,
we
didn't
affirmatively
used
it.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
sir.
i
would
like
the
court
amici
brief
which
is
in
this
court.
we
do
not
find
dorothy
kilgallen
statement
as
a
matter
of
record
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
in
the
amici
brief.
mr.
corrigan's
brief
in
this
court.
by
agreement
of
counsel
and
he
goes
on
to
say,
it
shows
your
statement
in
which
are
just
stated.
the
agreement
of
counsel
knows
this
administered
since
integrity
of
the
witness
is
not
in
this
view.
the
statement
was
taken
in
may
9th
in
new
york,
but
how
did
the
district
court
obtained
the
statement
is
not
a
matter
of
record.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
sir.
i
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
simply
because
this.
the
district
court
based
his
opinion
in
the
granting
of
the
habeas
corpus
not
on
the
record
but
on
facts
which
he
was
willing
to
accept
from
the
defendant's
brief,
from
dorothy
kilgallen,
from
extra
legal
areas
which
had
no
place
in
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
think
that
a
statement
for
it
was
uncontraverted
perhaps
could
have
been
considered
but
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it
would
have
no
effect
upon
the
outcome
of
the
case
in
this
court
because
the
trial
judge
was
not
deciding
the
guilt
or
innocence,
the
jury
was
and
the
only
question
to
be
raised
then
would
come
from
the
record
whether
did
he
take
this
over
to
the
jury.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
--
i
and
we
make
in
our
brief
the
argument
that
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
think
the
law
is
this
that
--
and
there
are
cases
to
bear
me
out
that
if
the
judge
is
prejudiced
which
in
this
case
he
wasn't
but
if
the
judge
is
prejudiced
that
the
trial
will
stand
unless
it
shows
that
his
prejudice
was
imputed
to
the
jury
and
that
his
handling
of
the
trial
was
in
error
so
that
it
makes
it
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
tumey
said
that
the
prejudice
was
built
in
simply
because
of
the
inherently
prejudicial
nature
of
it
and
the
tumey
case
of
course
says
and
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
you
know
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it
was
built-in
prejudice.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
but
in
the
tumey
case
that
they
say
that
given
the
judge
all
benefit
of
being
honest
which
they
say
that
this
judge
morner
was.
this
is
beyond
the
expectation
of
human
frailty
that
where
he
has
a
financial
interest
in
this
case
why
you
can
say
that
he
could
be
presumed
prejudice.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
oh,
if
they
had
proved
that
he
was
actual
prejudice,
i
think
you
should
(voice
overlap)
you
should
take
another
look
at
it
but
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
your
honor,
there's
a
number
of
cases
which
hold
that
even
though
the
--
the
judge
may
have
a
view
and
may
think
the
man
guilty
if
he
does
in
fact
afford
that
man
a
fair
trial
that
the
conviction
would
stand
if
--
and
in
this
case,
you
must
look
at
the
record,
you
must
look
at
the
voir
dire
examination
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
fair
trial
was
given,
the
statement
by
dorothy
kilgallen,
the
statement
by
murray
or
the
statement
by
anyone
else
basically
has
to
do
with
this
so-called
prejudice
but
basically,
we
can't
look
beyond
what
he
did
and
what
he
said.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
know.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
no
sir.
first,
because
the
kilgallen
statement
was
not
officially
in
the
record,
and
secondly,
what
could
you
say
to
combat
the
statement
of
a
dead
man?
you
could
attack
the
voracity
of
the
person
who
makes
the
affidavit
and
we
could
perhaps
in
this
but
the
legal
effect
of
trying
to
exonerate
a
dead
man
on
something
which
he
no
doubt
didn't
say
is
--
would
be
more
detracting
from
the
case
and
add
to
it,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
sir?
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
this
hearing
on
habeas
corpus
was
in
dayton
at
that
time
and
the
judge
was
willing
to
accept
this.
we
were
opposed
to
it
constantly.
and
in
my
opinion,
it
added
nothing
to
the
court
except
what
the
district
court
wanted
to
believe
and
i,
from
looking
at
the
statement
of
the
district
court,
i
mean
the
opinion
of
the
court,
i
don't
believe
he
looked
at
the
record.
i
believe
they
accepted
the
defendant's
brief
and
i
certainly
can't
find
any
place
in
there
for
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
as
pointed
out
in
the
record
were
brought
out.
i
have
here
some
37
instances
of
misstatement
of
facts
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
i
mean
some
of
them
is
going
to
judge
--
he
said
no
matter
how,
a
set
of
circumstances
which
has
never
changed
to
this
day.
he
in
fact
gave
nine
different
versions
of
what
happened
after
he
awoke
on
that
couch.
he
was
dis
--
shown
to
the
judge
or
to
the
jury
as
an
absolute
liar,
unworthy
of
belief.
and
the
jury
that
considered
these
facts,
considered
the
evidence
that
was
in
court
and
we
have
evidence
in
the
record
again
of
the
numerous
safeguards
that
the
judge
took.
this
voir
dire
examination
is
1600
pages.
now
you
raised
repeatedly
the
question
of
venue
or
continuance.
the
judge
didn't
rule
on
this
and
that
is
he
didn't
deny
he
continued
them
and
he
said,
let's
see
if
we
can
get
a
fair
jury.
let's
see
if
we
can
get
a
good
jury.
they
spent
1600
pages
and
nine
days
i
believe
it
was
in
examining
these
people
or
the
jury.
they
had
a
panel
of
75.
they
did
not
exhaust
the
panel,
periphery
charges
remained
for
the
defense.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
there
was
one
on
each
side
periphery
that
was
not
used.
the
voir
dire
examination
went
into
the
publicity.
it
went
into
the
understanding
that
they
had
of
the
case,
all
of
the
normal
questions
and
went
even
further
than
the
normal
thing.
now
one
of
the
basis
of
--
we
find
forward
in
here
is
the
statement
that
judge
edwards,
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
circuit
court
agreed
with
the
circuit
judge
or
with
the
district
judge
in
the
pretrial
publicity
and
this
is
not
true.
judge
edwards
in
his
dissent
found
no
fault
with
the
pretrial
publicity.
he
based
his
dissent
on
the
trial
publicity
which
was
basically
a
report
of
what
actually
went
on
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
in
some
--
in
some
instances,
they
followed
the
record
and
i
would
say
in
all
instances,
the
court
of
appeals
evidently
read
the
record,
they
followed
the
record.
and
the
things
that
judge
edwards
based
his
dissent
on,
the
jekyll-hyde
thing,
the
similar
things
as
that
were
factual,
things
that
happened,
but
a
great
many
other
things
actually
did
not
happen.
now
for
instance
this
story
just
like
in
the
[inaudible]
idea
that
he
was
hounded
by
the
law
enforcement
people
that
somehow
he
suffered
greatly
by
the
people
moving
in
on
it.
ten
minutes
after
he
called
mary
houk,
he
was
spirited
away
by
his
brother
to
their
private
hospital.
he
was
interviewed
not
continuously
as
would
have
you
believe
here
but
he
was
interviewed
i
think
twice
in
the
hospital.
he
came
downtown
and
made
a
statement
to
the
police
even
before
the
inquest.
these
facts
have
become
confused
to
the
point
and
repeated
so
often
that
you
would
believe
them
to
be
true,
now
in
my
brother
bailey
statement
this
morning,
you
would
gather
from
him
that
this
was
a
trial,
a
civil
trial
against
cleveland
press.
this
statement,
this
book,
this
chapter
of
mr.
seltzer
from
his
book,
the
years
were
good
was
written
about
the
time
that
this
case
came
to
the
supreme
court
--
this
court
in
1956.
at
no
place
was
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
and
there
was
again
an
agreed
statement
of
facts
which
was
not
followed
in
the
pleadings,
but
was
brought
in
by
the
ear
so
to
speak
by
including
it
as
an
appendix
to
his
brief
which
he
filed
in
the
district
court.
now
the
reason
that
the
attack
was
taken
this
morning,
that
this
press
was
not
really
so
bad,
that
this
presumption
of
prejudice
could
then
overcome
if
the
court
had
behave
properly,
if
they
had
run
a
trial
properly.
i
submit
that
this
was
a
trial
by
the
book.
it
was
a
good
trial,
judge
blythin
on
a
strict
courtroom.
he
maintained
order
and
he
cautioned
the
jury
every
time
they
left
the
jury
box
about
receiving
or
carrying
on
any
discussion,
conversation,
reading
about
the
case.
he
couldn't
have
done
more
and
a
review
of
the
record
is
the
only
thing
that
is
going
to
bring
this
out.
now
why
to
impute
to
this
court
a
failure
simply
because
your
cases
which
have
build
up
over
the
years
must
involve
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
state
some
place.
in
other
words,
the
action
of
the
newspapers
or
the
tv
is
not
enough.
you
must
impute
this
to
the
judge
that
he
allows
this
to
get
in
that
the
state
is
somehow
negligent.
in
the
rideau
case,
the
sheriff
appears
on
tv
with
the
--
with
the
prisoner.
the
irvin
case,
they
permitted
this
confession
to
get
out.
in
the
estes
case,
they
tolerated
the
cameras
in
the
courtroom.
in
other
words,
to
bring
this
over,
you've
got
to
involve
the
state
in
the
situation.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
sir.
the
usual
cannon
and
the
jury
was
not
in
fact
photographed
except
before
the
court
had
convened
or
afterwards.
it
would
be
--
you
would
lead
to
believe
from
the
testimony
that
they
were
in
there
with
cameras
and
they
were
photographing.
such
was
not
the
case.
the
defendant
was
photographed
in
the
courtroom
only
when
he
permitted
it
and
the
judge
so
directed
the
press
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
photographed
except
when
he
agreed
to
it
and
he
readily
agreed
a
number
of
times
and
brought
his
family
in
and
others
that
he
wanted
to
be
in
these
photographs.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes
sir,
it
was
taken
in
the
courtroom
but
it
was
before
--
i
don't
know
in
this
particular
case
whether
it
was
before
they
convened
or
afterwards
but
it
certainly
was
not
during
the
trial
and
you'll
find
no
allegation
of
such
a
thing
in
there.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
yes,
this
is
not
uncommon
to
take
people's
pictures
with
their
permission
when
there
is
actually
nothing
happening
in
the
courtroom.
now
there
were
pictures
taken
that
you'll
find
in
the
brief
and
they
allege
that
these
pictures
were
taken
in
jurors'
home
and
that
this
therefore
was
prejudicial.
this
is
not
the
case.
there
was
a
mrs.
mansini
who
was
a
juror.
she
never
took
part
in
any
deliberations
of
the
jury.
she
sat
there
with
them.
the
pictures
which
are
purported
to
be
in
a
juror's
home
are
in
the
home
of
mrs.
mansini
who
was
in
fact
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
not
a
juror
at
all.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
did
object
to
it.
i
believe,
you
will
find
that
he
did
object,
but
he
objected
that
they
were
taking
the
defendant's
photographs
and
judge
blythin
replied
that
if
the
defendant
didn't
want
to
be
photographed,
all
he
had
to
say
was
he
didn't
want
to
be
and
they
--
he
would
not
be.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
he
objected.
the
judge
said
that
there
will
be
no
photographs
before
or
during
and
this
objection
i
believe
came
up
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
the
actual
testimony
of
the
jurors
that
--
and
by
the
way,
there
were
three
jurors
put
on
at
this
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
determine
if
the
so-called
prejudicial
statements
of
the
press
during
the
trial
had
any
effect
on
them
or
whether
they
were
in
fact
prejudiced
and
the
results
were
negative.
the
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
they
actually
were
sworn
and
they
testified,
three
jurors
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
there
again
is
the
fact
that
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
record.
this
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
juries
are
not
sequestered
in
ohio
and
it
is
in
a
very
unusual
occasion
when
it
is.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
usually
by
agreement
of
the
parties
that
is
by
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
attorney
or
the
defense
attorney
would
go
to
the
judge
and
give
reasons
for
it,
they
would
be
sequestered.
but
this
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
this
was
discussed
in
the
brief.
it
was
discussed
in
mr.
bailey's
brief.
mr.
bailey
took
the
attitude
that
--
and
there
again,
we're
talking
about
a
deceased
man,
mr.
corrigan
probably
did
not
object
because
he
felt
that
the
sequestering
over
a
period
of
time
would
be
more
harmful
than
it
would
be
to
helpful.
of
course
after
they
go
into
deliberation
after
they
got
the
case
they
are
sequestered
and
they
were
sequestered
during
all
of
their
deliberation.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
it
was
absolute.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
that
is
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
it
was
decided
in
the
highest
supreme
court
which
again
you
would
have
to
get
from
the
record
and
not
from
mr.
bailey's
petitioner
brief,
the
highest
supreme
court
decided
that
that
was
not
illegal
in
ohio.
it
was
not
prejudicial.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
they
were
--
they
were
permitted.
i
think
three
of
them.
they
sat
with
the
bailiff
sat
by
the
telephone,
called
the
number
and
sat
there
and
listen
to
all
what
was
said.
now
in
a
minute
or
two
that
i
have,
i
would
like
to
say
this
and
i
for
one
and
i
know
that
this
is
a
great
issue
in
this
case.
i
don't
feel
that
we
have
to
throw
out
the
first
amendment
to
preserve
the
sixth.
i
think
that
they
can
continue
together
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
only
choice
that
we
have.
i
think
the
choice
that
we're
faced
with
in
this
case
is
basically
one
of
the
court
handling
of
the
man.
and
this,
mr.
bailey
and
i
agree
the
fact
that
i
don't
find
any
capability
or
any
inclination
on
the
part
of
the
judiciary
or
the
legislative
to
infringe
upon
the
first
amendment
and
you
have
good
press
and
you
have
a
bad
press.
now
are
we
going
to
extend
to
them
the
privileges
of
the
first
amendment
when
they
have
good
press
and
take
it
away
when
they
have
bad.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
judge
maintained
a
strict
decorum.
i
think
he
ran
the
trial
by
the
books.
i
think
he
got
a
good
jury
and
i
think
sam
sheppard
was
convicted
because
he
was
shown
by
the
exhibits
and
the
witnesses
to
be
guilty
and
that
the
facts
that
were
brought
in
to
the
courtroom
on
his
behalf
might
have
shown
that
he
was
a
good
fellow
but
certainly
had
nothing
to
show
in
regard
to
his
innocence
as
charged.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
think
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
find
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
but
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
i
know
but
you
know
the
rule
in
ohio
that
they
could
have
found
him
guilty
or
manslaughter
just
as
well.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
but
it
certainly
not
compromised.
they
determined,
i
presume,
although
we
don't
have
evidence
on
this
that
this
was
in
hot
blood
hood
which
is
what
second-degree
murder
is
in
ohio
and
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
in
ohio,
being
drunk
would
have
no
effect,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
if
premeditation
was
there,
he
would
be
guilty
of
first-degree
murder.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
if
premeditation,
if
this
--
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
if
--
if
there
was
no
premeditation
shown
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
everything
was
shown
by
premeditation,
he
was
probably
guilty
of
murdering
a
second-degree.
mr.
william
b.
saxbe
murder
in
the
second-degree
which
is
murder
in
hot
blood.
if
there
was
no
premeditation
or
hot
blood,
it
would
probably
manslaughter
if
it's
an
illegal
act.
