mr.
f.
lee
bailey
for
the
petitioner
your
honor,
dr.
samuel
h.
sheppard.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
on
may
5th
last
reversed,
two
to
one,
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
voiding
the
ohio
conviction
of
dr.
samuel
h.
sheppard
which
was
recorded
in
1954.
the
district
judge
in
his
opinion
noted
five
independent
federal
constitutional
violations,
each
of
which
in
his
judgment,
warranted
granting
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
he
determined
that
the
five
of
them
constituted
this
case
as
it
was
tried
and
carried
through
the
state
courts
a
mockery
of
justice.
on
july
3rd,
1954,
dr.
samuel
h.
sheppard
was
an
osteopathic
neurosurgeon
living
in
the
hamlet
of
bay
village,
ohio
a
few
miles
west
of
cleveland.
he
was
30
years
old
as
was
his
young
wife
marilyn.
they
have
one
child,
age
seven.
they
lived
on
the
shore
of
lake
erie.
he
was
a
busy
and
successful
doctor
as
were
his
two
older
brothers,
both
surgeons
and
his
father,
also
a
physician.
the
four
of
them
run
a
clinic
and
they
were
active
in
the
bay
view
hospital
located
in
bay
village.
the
sheppards
entertained
that
night
some
friends
named
ahern.
at
some
time
during
the
evening
while
on
television,
a
movie
was
being
observed
called,
strange
holiday,
dr.
sheppard
fell
asleep
on
the
couch.
the
aherns
left
some
time
around
midnight
and
bade
marilyn
sheppard
goodnight
at
the
door
and
she
was
never
seen
alive
again.
some
time
around
six
o’clock
in
the
morning,
a
man
leaving
two
doors
distant
from
dr.
sheppard,
j.
spencer
houk
the
mayor
of
bay
village
received
a
telephone
call.
he
recognized
the
voice
of
the
petitioner,
who
said
words
in
substance,
“spen,
come
quick.
i
think
they
have
killed
marilyn.”
mayor
houk
got
up
and
get
dressed,
got
his
wife
up
and
got
her
dressed,
and
they
got
in
the
family
automobile
and
drove
about
75
yards
to
the
sheppard
home.
when
they
entered
the
home,
they
found
dr.
sheppard
lying
on
the
floor
downstairs.
mrs.
houk
went
upstairs
and
found
marilyn
sheppard
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood.
authorities
arrived,
the
bay
village
police,
the
cleveland
police,
the
county
sheriffs
office,
the
county
prosecutors
office
and
the
county
coroner’s
office.
an
investigation
was
immediately
commenced.
no
witness,
save
of
dr.
sheppard
has
ever
reported
any
facts
from
his
own
knowledge
as
having
occurred
between
midnight
and
six
o’clock
on
the
fourth
day
of
july
1954.
and
what
dr.
sheppard
had
to
say
was
this
and
still
is,
“that
at
some
time
during
the
night
and
he
does
not
know
the
time,
he
awoke
from
a
deep
sleep
by
what
he
imagined
to
be
screaming
and
thought
his
wife
who
was
then
pregnant
was
having
convulsions,
that
he
rushed
up
the
stairs
to
the
bedroom
which
was
on
the
second
floor.
and
that
the
bedroom
was
dimly
lit,
and
as
he
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
or
as
he
entered
the
bedroom,
the
point
about
which
he
was
uncertain,
he
noticed
a
white
shape
or
form,
apparently
a
human
form
standing
near
the
head
of
the
bed.
as
he
entered
the
room
and
attempted
to
attack
or
grapple
the
form,
he
was
struck
from
behind
and
rendered
unconscious.
at
some
later
point,
he
awoke
on
the
floor
of
the
bedroom
and
heard
noises
on
the
first
floor.
he
got
up
and
run
down
the
stairs.”
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
think
the
inference
is
that
it
was
a
human
being.
dr.
sheppard
said,
he
could
not
be
sure
except
that
it
had
a
white
top
as
it
stood
next
to
the
bed.
i
think
it
is
a
human
being,
the
question
being
whether
it
was
male
or
female,
the
question
remaining
in
the
evidence.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
very
strong
inference
that
there
was
more
than
one
person
your
honors.
we
see
the
state
of
the
evidence
in
the
record,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
person.
dr.
sheppard
was
about
to
attack
to
struck
a
rabbit
punch
in
the
back
of
his
neck
.we
believe
there
were
two,
one
of
whom
was
a
woman.
as
dr.
sheppard
charged
down
the
stairs,
he
observed
the
man
fleeing
out
the
screen
door
toward
the
lake
and
he
chased
him.
he
chased
him
down
to
certain
wooden
steps
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
their
grappled
with
him
and
became
in
some
manner
held
around
the
neck
and
was
again
rendered
unconscious.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
there
is
no
question
this
time,
but
--
that
this
was
a
man
at
one
time
described
as
having
had
bushy
hair,
a
bushy-headed
man.
when
dr.
sheppard
awoke
for
the
third
time,
the
sun
was
breaking
over
lake
erie
and
he
says
that
he
got
up,
he
was
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
water
and
indeed
later
on
the
sand
was
found
in
his
pants
and
trouser
caps
and
his
trousers
were
wet,
his
t-shirt
was
missing.
he
ran
up
to
the
bedroom
where
his
wife
lay
covered
with
blood,
checked
her
pulse
and
found
that
she
was
gone,
put
his
knee
against
the
side
of
the
bed
as
he
did
so
and
later
it
was
discovered
that
the
only
blood
showing
on
dr.
sheppard
was
a
spot
on
the
knee
diluted
with
water
and
then
he
went
down
the
stairs
and
called
mayor
houk
and
then
fell
to
the
floor.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
a
t-shirt
was
found.
it
was
never
determined
whether
or
not
it
was
dr.
sheppard’s.
it's
in
my
recollection
that
it
had
no
traces
of
blood
whatsoever.
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
an
important
piece
of
evidence
in
the
case.
dr.
sheppard's
older
brothers
richard
and
steve
upon
receiving
notification
of
the
tragedy,
rushed
to
sam's
house.
dr.
steven
sheppard
made
an
examination
of
sam
sheppard
and
determined
that
he
was
in
shock
that
he
had
spasm
in
the
neck
and
he
ordered
him
removed
to
the
bay
view
hospital
and
this
was
done.
he
was
taken
there
by
dr.
steven
and
by
an
orderly
who
had
responded
to
the
call.
at
bay
view
hospital,
he
was
x-rayed
and
was
found
to
have
a
bone
chip
in
the
second
cervical
vertebrae.
his
teeth
were
loosened
and
he
had
severe
bruises
about
the
face.
he
was
questioned
almost
immediately
by
county
authorities,
who
over
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
questioned
him
intensively
and
extensively.
before
the
day
was
out,
an
accusation
had
been
tossed
to
dr.
sheppard
that
he
was
the
number
one
suspect
principally
because
no
other
suspects
had
turned
out.
he
was
asked
to
take
a
lie
detector
test.
dr.
sheppard
asked
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
deputy
sheriff
carl
rossbach
i
believe
was
among
the
first
who
told
him
that
he
was
a
suspect
and
said,
“will
you
take
a
lie
detector
test?”
and
dr.
sheppard
asked
how
it
worked
and
was
informed
that
it
worked
as
a
result
of
certain
physiological
phenomenon
measured
by
a
machine
called
the
polygraph
and
he
replied
at
that
time,
“i
don't
feel
that
my
physical
condition
is
sufficient
to
make
the
test
accurate”
and
he
declined.
later
on
in
the
day
because
of
the
attitude
of
the
police,
the
family
lawyer
[inaudible]
so
he
hired
a
well-known
criminal
lawyer,
william
j.
corrigan
to
give
advice
to
the
sheppards
because
it
was
apparent
that
the
trial
was
up.
the
police
demanded
to
interrogate
sheppard
and
they
did
interrogate
him
at
sometimes
under
certain
conditions
set
by
attorney
corrigan.
the
newspapers
of
course
reported
this
incident
with
every
column
inch
they
had
available.
and
for
many
days,
speculation
ran
right
from
the
community
as
to
what
sort
of
bushy-headed
bloody
monster
was
running
about
and
ready
to
strike
again.
but
after
a
time,
other
news
occurring
here
and
there
on
the
face
of
the
earth
began
to
force
the
sheppard
case
out
of
page
1
column
1
and
this
disturbed
according
to
a
certain
documented
product
which
is
reproduced
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
the
editor
of
a
cleveland
newspaper
with
a
circulation
of
300,000.
and
he
felt
--
he
said
that
because
dr.
sam
sheppard
was
the
police
surgeon
in
bay
village
and
because
the
family
was
well
to
do
and
well-known
in
bay
village
that
the
fix
was
in
or
something
tantamount
to
influence
covering
up
a
murderer.
and
so
he
says
fearful
that
the
case
would
drop
out
of
the
public
mind
and
noticing
that
the
other
newspapers
were
beginning
to
turn
their
attentions
elsewhere,
he
unleashed
his
editorial
artillery.
his
paper,
the
cleveland
press
kept
the
case
on
page
1.
thereafter
an
article
was
published
or
i
should
say
an
editorial
saying
that
someone
was
getting
away
with
murder.
this
editorial
appeared
on
the
front
page
directly
below
as
statement,
sheppard
sat
for
a
new
quiz.
the
plain
import
of
the
editorial
was
that
dr.
sam
sheppard
was
getting
away
with
murder,
but
nobody
moved
to
arrest
him
perhaps
for
lack
of
evidence.
then
the
cleveland
press
demanded
that
the
cleveland
police
take
over
the
investigation
because
they
are
by
far
the
more
competent
and
after
all
dr.
sheppard
would
not
have
the
his
influence
with
the
cleveland
police
and
with
an
hour
of
two
of
this
editorial
demand,
the
cleveland
police
were
called
in
by
the
fathers
of
bay
village
and
then
the
press
demanded
that
the
coroner
called
an
inquest.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
believe
they
were
called
in
by
the
town
of
bay
village
to
take
over
the
investigation
on
the
ground
that
bay
village
didn't
feel
itself
competent
to
handle
the
immense
problems
of
technology
and
of
the
difficulties
involved
your
honor.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
appears
to
have
eventually
formulated
into
a
request
by
the
town
counsel
of
bay
village.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
is
your
honor
in
cuyahoga
county
located
in
cleveland.
the
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
he
did
not
use
those
precise
words.
he
complained
about
the
probability
that
dr.
sam's
influence
in
his
position
was
causing
him
to
get
kid
lock
treatment
and
that
much
was
not
being
told
to
the
people
which
ordinary
investigation
would
have
turned
up.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes
your
honor
that
is,
that
is
in
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
no
your
honor,
the
editor
of
this
newspaper
has
written
a
book
called
an
autobiography
entitled
the
years
were
good,
chapter
26
in
its
entirety
is
devoted
to
the
sheppard
case
and
it
appears
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
at
approximately
page
rs
180.
it
is
set
forth
in
its
entirety
and
explains
his
reasons
for
what
he
did.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
is
your
honor,
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
original
petition
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
well,
it's
page
rs
180.
i
believe
the
last
document
on
the
quote.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes
your
honor,
the
years
were
good,
s180.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
almost
at
the
end
of
the
petition.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
should
like
to
point
out
at
this
juncture
that
the
police
immediately
claimed
that
their
inability
to
interrogate
dr.
sheppard
was
the
bugaboo
in
the
case
and
that
he
would
not
come
down
to
police
headquarters.
he
had
of
course
been
interrogated
many
times
sometimes
with
his
counsel
at
present
but
it
was
suggested
that
an
appropriate
grilling
and
that
word
was
used
in
an
editorial,
a
third
degree
to
which
he
should
have
been
instantly
subjected
in
the
view
of
the
cleveland
press,
might
produce
the
desired
result.
he
did
not
go
to
police
headquarters
although
the
prosecutor,
john
j.
mahon
issued
a
public
statement
saying
if
he
does
not
come
voluntarily
to
police
headquarters
we
will
convene
an
inquest
and
compel
him
to
testify.
cleveland
press
then
ran
an
editorial
entitled,
“why
no
inquest?”
isn't
this
murder
worth
an
inquest?
and
substituted
for
the
same
text
in
a
later
edition
of
the
same
paper,
the
mandate
rather
than
the
rhetorical
question,
“why
no
inquest,
do
it
now,
dr.
gerber.”
dr.
samuel
gerber,
a
doctor,
a
lawyer
and
elective
coroner
of
cuyahoga
county
for
many
years.
within
a
few
i
should
say
minutes
or
perhaps
an
hour
of
the
appearance
of
this
edition
on
the
streets
called
an
inquest.
he
did
not
hold
the
inquest
in
the
county
morgue
as
was
his
custom
but
in
the
gymnasium
in
bay
village.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
if
it
had
occurred
an
isolation
your
honor,
i
would
think
it
would
afford
no
ground
or
relief
or
complaint.
in
the
total
context
of
the
manipulation
of
public
officials
by
the
cleveland
press,
i
think
that
an
important
piece
of
evidence.
i
think
the
editorial
calling
for
the
inquest
to
have
been
unfair
and
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
called
was
unconstitutional,
that
was
to
force
dr.
sheppard
to
testify.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
no
your
honor.
that
was
the
later
editorial.
this
editorial
is
reproduced
in
our
appendix
as
it
appeared
in
the
cleveland
press
on
page
s-117,
that
was
the
first
editorial.
it
runs
above
the
bannerhead
and
then
on
page
s-118,
the
second
edition,
the
same
newspaper,
the
same
text,
“why
no
inquest?
do
it
now,
dr.
gerber.”
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
all
we
know
about
the
trial
record
your
honor
is
that
mr.
corrigan,
the
defense
counsel
offered
many
newspapers
and
other
documents
to
the
trial
judge
in
support
of
this
change
of
venue
and
that
they
were
excluded.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
do
not.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
they
were
your
honor.
the
five
things
[inaudible]
is
presently
in
this
court
purporting
to
contain
every
flipping
in
the
case
of
material
value.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
think
no
your
honor.
i
would
assume
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
mr.
corrigan
having
been
competent
counsel
would
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
all
of
the
publicity.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes
your
honor,
this
same
editorial
was
before
he
was
in
that
petition.
i
have
that
petition
right
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
much
of
what
appears
in
the
petition
you
granted
was
also
in
this
petition.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
(voice

‘52.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
the
words
of
the
article.
i
might
say,
this
petitioned
--
the
1956
petition
was
admitted
at
the
habeas
hearing
by
agreement
of
counsel.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
much
of
what
you
now
consider
your
honors
was
before
you
then
in
that
original
(voice
overlap)
--
yes.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes
it
certainly,
it
could
your
honor.
it
was
exacted
at
that
time.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
think
that
mr.
corrigan
included
most
of
that
upon
which
i
now
rely
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
--
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
appears
that
at
the
time
he
filed
his
petition,
mr.
seltzer's
book
stating
his
role
in
this
case
and
the
risk
that
he
took
deliberately
was
not
in
print
so
that
was
not
available.
mr.
corrigan
did
not
emphasize
as
heavily
as
have
i,
the
many
statements
by
beliefs
that
they
knew
dr.
sheppard
was
guilty
but
he
was
clever,
intelligent
and
properly
hidden
the
evidence.
this
is
one
of
the
things
about
which
i
very
loudly
complain.
however,
mr.
corrigan
did
not
pass
that
issue.
he
just
did
not
give
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
oh
yes.
in
this
petition,
there
are
two
distinct
additional
issues.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
one
is
the
bias
of
a
trial
judge
which
was
not
known
to
any
of
counsel
for
petitioner
until
the
habeas
petition
was
almost
a
year
old.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
was.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
the
trial
judge
is
now
deceased.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
he
did
your
honor.
the
other
issue
involves
the
receipt
of
the
lie
detector
evidence
by
the
trial
court.
those
two
are
the
principle
distinct
issues.
i
should
point
out
that
the
lie
detector
question
was
raised
in
another
context
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
turned
aside.
it
was
not
passed
upon.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
the
extent
that
it
appears
to
have
been
for
that
purpose,
i
think
it
--
to
have
been
an
improper
proceeding
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
the
defense
counsel
was
ejected
from
it
forcibly.
however,
i
offer
it
as
part
of
the
total
context
of
this
case
contributing
to
the
envenomed
atmosphere
which
occurred
in
cleveland
on
october
18th,
1954
when
the
trial
began
because
this
court
has
in
estes
versus
texas,
indicated
that
pretrial
hearings
and
the
like
maybe
relevant
to
an
assessment
of
the
total
atmosphere
of
trial.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
was
conduct
your
honor,
certainly,
he
was
objecting
to
the
methods
of
the
coroner.
i
should
point
out
that
we
contend
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
this
inquest
was
more
of
a
circus
than
an
inquest
and
that
apparently
it
was
intended
to
satisfy
the
people.
at
least
this
is
what
mr.
gerber
testified
to
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
when
challenged
in
the
point
and
ask
why
he
didn't
hold
it
in
the
morgue
as
was
his
usual
custom.
in
any
event
from
the
inquest,
flowed
a
threat
by
the
coroner
i
could
hold
dr.
sam
sheppard,
hold
him
for
the
grand
jury,
however,
he
did
not
do
so.
finally,
the
cleveland
press
printed
an
editorial
which
i
submit
to
this
court
as
the
most
outrageous.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
don't
find
in
the
record
your
honor
any
conclusion.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes,
he
adjourned
it
voluntarily.
it
was
not
interrupted.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
no,
i
think
he
terminated
it
but
not
in
any
final
sense
to
the
extent
that
i
think
the
idea
was
to
extent
he
might
have
reopened
it
if
some
new
evidence
had
appeared.
the
inquest
is
frankly
very
puzzling
to
me.
page
s-124
of
our
petition,
there
appears
an
editorial
which
is
bannerheaded
on
page
1
and
covers
the
top
of
the
entire
front
page
of
the
cleveland
press.
and
it
says,
“why
isn't
sam
sheppard
in
jail?”
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
this
was
july
30th,
26
days
later
your
honor.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes
your
honor.
in
the
final
edition
of
the
cleveland
press
on
that
same
date,
that
same
editorial
was
positioned
in
the
center
of
page
1
and
the
heading
was
changed
again
from
the
question
to
the
mandate,
“quit
stalling,
bring
him
in.”
and
for
the
third
time,
cuyahoga
county
responded
to
the
cleveland
press
and
sam
sheppard
was
arrested.
there
is
in
the
record
absolutely
no
indication
that
within
the
past
24,
48
or
72
hours
any
new
evidence
constituting
probable
cause
which
had
theretofore
been
lacking,
had
been
deduced
or
arrived
at
by
the
cleveland
authorities.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
most
of
them
your
honor.
most
of
the
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
don't
think
so.
none
of
great
significance,
the
others
were
before
you
then.
now
the
editor
of
the
cleveland
press
said
that
the
whole
question
confronting
the
press
as
a
newspaper,
concerned
about
the
whole
structure
of
law
enforcement
the
community
was
“shall
we
permit
a
protective
wall
to
shield
a
solution
to
this
murder
by
saying
and
doing
nothing?”
or
“shall
we
move
in
with
all
of
our
editorial
artillery
in
an
effort
to
bring
the
wall
down?”
there
were
risks
both
ways.
one
risk
--
one
represented
the
risk
to
the
community,
the
other
was
a
risk
to
the
press.
we
chose
the
risk
to
ourselves.
as
editor
of
the
press,
i
would
do
the
same
thing
over
again
under
the
same
circumstances.
not
considered
that
mr.
seltzer
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
that
is
the
conclusion
of
chapter
26
of
the
autobiography
of
mr.
seltzer
looking
back
on
the
trial
that
was
published
in
1956.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
at
about
the
time
this
court
denied
certiorari.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it's
not
a
part
of
the
record.
initially,
it
was
filed
in
the
district
court
in
the
habeas
proceedings
as
part
of
the
publicity
and
explanation
report.
as
i
began
to
point
out
your
honor,
not
considered
in
the
deliberations
with
mr.
seltzer
was
the
risk
to
sam
sheppard
that
the
editorial
should
be
unleashed
upon
an
innocent
man.
now,
there
is
a
fashionable
hue
and
cry
these
days
to
throttle
the
newspapers,
silence
them
until
all
these
court
proceedings
are
at
an
end
in
criminal
cases
and
might
have
been
said
about
the
dilemma.
i
think
that
there's
ample
reason
in
the
records
of
this
case
and
in
the
exhibits
before
this
court
to
be
concerned
about
newspapers
that
used
their
editorial
pages
to
prod
elective
officials
into
action
when
they
are
hesitant
because
of
the
lack
of
what
to
his
lawyers
are
supposed
to
move
on
and
that
is
evidence
of
probable
cause,
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
failure
in
this
case
is
one
of
the
press.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
an
occasion
to
suggest
new
ideas
for
shackling
the
press
or
exercising
or
broadening
the
contempt
procedure.
the
failures
and
repeated
failures
of
the
entire
system
so
far
as
control
of
the
lawyers
and
the
judge
and
the
police
are
blatant
and
repeated
and
i
think
that
these
primarily
caused
dr.
sheppard
any
chance
for
fair
trial.
repeatedly
in
the
exhibits
which
are
before
you,
police
are
announcing
that
dr.
sheppard
is
guilty.
if
they
had
a
chance
to
interrogate
him
without
counsel,
they
would
have
extracted
his
confession.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
no
your
honor,
what
i
mean
is
this.
that,
although
a
trial
by
a
newspaper
presents
a
serious
problem,
we
have
sufficient
remedies
within
the
law
which
were
not
exhausted
in
this
case,
to
dispose
of
this
case
on
a
failure
of
those
remedies
without
coming
to
the
question
at
least
in
this
case
of
what
must
be
done
to
silence
the
press.
and
if
all
of
those
remedies
had
been
exhausted,
the
continuance
of
the
change
of
venue
when
the
prosecutor
who
could
learn
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
about
what
he
was
going
to
present,
and
still
there
was
a
conviction
then
perhaps
and
only
then
in
my
judgment
might
it
be
time
to
think
about
restraints
on
the
press.
i
don't
think
that
those
are
necessary
to
dispose
all
cases
like
this.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
this
jury
was
not
sequestered
your
honor,
however
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
the
record
does
not
disclose
such
a
motion,
i'm
sorry
to
say.
and
apparently,
from
my
experience,
it's
not
the
custom
in
ohio
as
in
some
other
states
to
sequester
juries
automatically
in
serious
or
murder
cases.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
appears
not
to
be
your
honor.
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
ohio
bar.
my
acquaintance
is
ancillary
--
principally
as
a
result
of
this
case,
but
i
think
perhaps
mr.
saxbe
can
say
that
it
is
not
common
practice
as
it
is
in
some
states
as
a
matter
or
routine.
i
suggest
to
this
court
as
one
of
the
remedies
which
ought
to
evolve
from
this
case
that
lower
courts
should
be
urged
that
they
upheld
to
sequester
juries.
they
cannot
be
protected
from
news
media
by
instructions
asking
for
self-serving
answers
that
the
witnesses
heard
the
most
damnable
and
outrageous
material
about
the
defendant
but
will
not
be
influenced.
the
compact
mentalization
of
the
human
mind
is
not
yet
sufficient
to
exclude
information
such
as
was
broadcast
by
mr.
winchell
and
mr.
considine
in
this
case
damning
the
defendant
even
during
his
trial
and
yet
disregarded
in
making
that
kind
of
total
assessment
of
a
man
which
a
jury
verdict
is.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
took
them
about
nine
weeks
your
honor
including
two
weeks
for
impaneling
a
jury.
it
took
the
jury
five
days
to
reach
a
verdict.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
about
seven.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
believe
that's
roughly
accurate
your
honor.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
the
trial
began
october
18th.
the
murder
occurred
june
4th.
at
sometime
on
june
4th,
dr.
sheppard
was
arrested
on
july
--
i'm
sorry,
the
murder
occurred
july
4th
and
dr.
sheppard
was
arrested
july
30th
and
he
was
indicted
a
few
days
later.
he
was
out
on
bail
for
a
few
hours
after
arresting
him
for
indictment
as
i
recall.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
think
the
damage
was
this
your
honor
and
that
is
why
in
my
brief
i
have
suggested
that
this
does
not
fall
squarely
within
the
cases
you
have
earlier
decided
in
the
same
general
area.
there
was
no
confession
in
this
case.
there
was
no
criminal
record
announced.
there
was
no
preliminary
hearing
at
which
evidence
was
taken
and
then
broadcast.
there
was
--
began
initially
by
mr.
seltzer
and
picked
up
by
the
other
newspapers
and
new
media
the
notion
that
dr.
sheppard
was
hiding
the
evidence.
it
is
implicit
in
all
of
the
publicity
and
especially
in
those
editorials
that
were
published
during
this
period
and
i
believe
that
it
conditioned
the
community
to
find
him
guilty
unless
he
could
prove
his
own
innocence.
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
the
publicity
was
so
prejudicial
as
to
have
required
a
continuance
of
change
of
venue
at
that
point.
either
remedy
might
have
been
of
tremendous
help
but
i
think
that
no
man
can
be
expected
to
go
to
trial
even
with
the
continuance
or
change
of
venue
if
a
newspaper
will
be
permitted
to
do
what
the
cleveland
press
did
the
day
that
the
sheppard
trial
began,
that
is
the
day
the
jury
was
impaneled
and
that
is
to
print
a
front
page
editorial
saying,
“who
will
speak
for
marilyn?”
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
that
is
on
rs-126.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
but
who
will
speak
for
marilyn?
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes.
i
further
suggest
that
if
the
trial
had
to
begin
that
that
which
appears
on
page
s-127
to
which
a
jury
was
exposed
at
least.
a
statement
--
a
prediction
indicating
the
prosecutor
was
apparently
conferring
with
the
press
before
putting
witnesses
on
the
stand
wherein
it
was
announced
that
a
bombshell
witness
would
testify
that
mrs.
sheppard
had
called
her
husband
a
dr.
jekyll
and
mr.
hyde,
that
of
course
which
the
witness
could
never
have
testified
to
and
did
not
offer
to.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
he
did
testify,
yes.
he
said
that
dr.
sam
sheppard
was
a
man
of
violent
tempers
because
he
once
seen
him
spank
his
son.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
he
do
(voice
overlap).
he
did
not
make
eject
or
hide
statement
and
was
not
elicited
from
him
or
asked
for
him.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
the
principles
of
irvin
against
dowd
i
think
apply
the
facts
are
quite
different
and
the
number
of
jurors
who
were
willing
to
admit
the
formation
of
the
opinion
of
guilt
is
substantially
different.
i
think
the
principle
of
rideau
against
louisiana
is
applicable
even
though
the
facts
are
substantially
different
and
i
suggest
to
them
very
urgently
because
my
brother
saxbe
will
be
unable
to
present
this
court
with
one
single
good
legitimate
reason
why
a
continuance
or
a
change
of
venue
could
not
have
been
easily
granted
without
harm
to
the
state
except
for
the
fact
that
certain
of
the
principles
were
running
for
an
election
and
voting
day
was
during
the
trial
as
it
turned
up.
i
wish
to
deal
your
honors
if
i
may
at
this
time
to
my
brother
mr.
berkman
from
the
american
civil
liberties
union
whose
discussion
will
be
devoted
to
the
same
issue.
there
are
other
issues
presented
which
i
will
hope
to
get
to
in
the
15
minutes
of
rebuttal
which
have
been
reserved.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes
your
honor,
brought
to
my
brother.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
much
of
the
confusion
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case
which
i
frankly
didn't
expect
to
argue
at
this
level,
arises
from
the
fact
that
neither
mr.
saxbe
nor
mr.
corrigan
has
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case
or
in
the
appearance
except
the
argument
in
the
sixth
circuit
court,
neither
appeared
in
the
district
court
and
mr.
corrigan
never
tried
to
appear.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
on
the
first
day
of
our
conference
with
judge
carl
weinman
in
january
1963,
mr.
goodthrough
bowerman
appeared
for
the
county
of
cuyahoga.
mr.
kessler
and
mr.
cianflona
appeared
as
did
i
and
the
judge
has
(voice
overlap)
remember.
kessler
is
the
assistant
attorney
general
who
handled
the
case
through
the
district
court.
mrs.
mann
was
asked
if
she
were
a
member
of
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
and
she
said
no
and
the
judge
then
said,
then
you're
not
entitled
to
appear
and
we
had
a
lobby
conference.
later,
she
was
admitted
by
a
special
motion.
you
will
find
that
mrs.
mayer
not
only
appeared
but
asked
questions
of
garmone
and
murray.
and
then
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
county
attorney
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
assistant
to
mr.
corrigan,
very
much
participated.
she
was
a
member
and
permitted
to
appear
but
did
not
show
in
our
meetings
in
dayton.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas
the
question
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
that's
right,
after
she
was
admitted.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
she
had
the
right
to
and
she
certainly
knew
about
it.
she
did
appear
during
the
interrogations
in
cleveland.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
mr.
corrigan
whether
or
not
an
emmett
mahar
was
present
at
that
time.
murray
heard
the
judge
make
a
statement
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes,
page
387
(a).
mrs.
mann,
did
you
say
emmett
mahar
was
present?
mr.
murray,
“emmett
mahar
was
present,
yes.”
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
he
is
deceased,
yes.
one
of
great
difficulties
in
this
case
your
honor
as
many
of
the
personalities
are
deceased.
unfortunately,
it
comes
to
this
court
12
years
after
it
was
tried
which
creates
problems
for
us
all
including
dr.
sheppard.
now
as
to
this
matter
of
miss
kilgallen,
i
think
it
most
improper
for
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of

nine
copies
i
believe
are
before
the
court.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
yes.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
mr.
carl
royce
informed
me
that
nine
copies
of
these
three
volumes
had
been
sent
to
your
honors.
this
is
the
record
appendix
filed
by
my
brother
saxbe
in
the
sixth
circuit
court.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
on
page

(a).
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
second
and
last
brief
filed
by
the
state
in
the
district
court
and
here
is
what
was
said
about
the
statements
relating
to
judge
blythin's
state
of
mind.
the
respondent
is
aware
that
the
petitioner
is
going
to
present
statements
to
the
effect
that
the
trial
judge
expressed
his
belief
in
the
petitioner
before
the
trial
commenced.
accordingly,
respondent
invites
the
court's
attention
to
the
recent
case
of
hendrix
against
hand
312
f.2d
1962
wherein
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
trial
judge
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution
signed
a
statement
in
advance
to
a
trial
relating
to
the
judges
belief
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
the
crime
charged
and
did
not
establish
any
infringement
of
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial.
now
this
issue
was
met
on
the
merits.
the
evidence
was
not
disputed
by
my
brother
saxbe
in
the
district
court
and
indeed
until
he
sent
for
a
copy
of
the
docket
entries
in
order
to
put
together
his
appeal,
it
seems
likely
that
he
did
not
know
for
some
reason
this
kilgallen
statement
which
was
in
fact
furnished
to
judge
weinman
had
not
been
noted
in
the
record.
but
when
judge
weinman
was
advised
on
may
6,
1964
in
his
chambers,
all
counsel
present
that
evidence
of
judge
blythin
statement
was
available.
he
left
it
to
counsel
to
bring
that
evidence
to
the
court
as
they
saw
fit,
testimony
on
open
court,
deposition
under
oath,
affidavit
or
anything
mutually
satisfactory.
i
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
he
said
the
evidence
of
which
he
was
advised.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
with
respect
to
his
pleasure
is
to
hold
a
hearing
or
take
depositions.
it
could
be
presented
to
him
in
anyway
satisfactory
to
both
counsels.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
we
could
do
that.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
we
could
do
that.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
and
his
order
to
that
effect
as
of
may
6
is
clear.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
i
don't
think
i
have
to
recite
anything
not
in
the
record
your
honor
because
on
may
9th,
1964,
i
flew,
mr.
kessler
and
another
assistant
attorney
general
to
new
york
and
we
went
to
miss
kilgallen's
house.
she
offered
to
get
a
notary
from
around
the
corner
and
we
agreed
to
that
it
was
not
necessary
and
i
made
this
statement.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
page
388
(a).
mr.
saxbe
omitted
to
read
this
when
your
honors
asked
him
to
read
the
statement
of
miss
kilgallen.
this
is
the
opening.
mr.
bailey,
this
statement
taken
for
submission
with
a
stipulation
resulting
from
the
order
of
the
court
of
may
6,
1964
is
agreed
by
the
parties
to
have
the
status
of
a
deposition.
by
agreement
of
counsel,
no
oath
is
administered
since
the
integrity
of
the
witness
is
not
in
dispute.
if
counsel
doesn't
have
the
power
to
make
that
kind
of
agreement
in
a
civil
case
such
as
habeas
corpus,
it
is
news
to
me,
but
if
counsel
having
made
such
an
agreement,
have
the
right
and
the
entirety
to
come
to
an
appellate
court
and
deny
it
and
say
the
district
judge
have
no
right
to
accept
the
claim
they
made
objections
which
were
never
made
to
castigate
the
district
judge
for
holding
in-camera
hearings
when
in
fact
no
hearings
were
other
held
then
i
think
that
new
rules
need
be
formulated
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
now
the
statement
of
judge
blythin
is
as
distasteful
to
me
as
to
the
judge
who
had
to
decide
this
issue
and
he
could
well
have
passed
it.
he
passed
some
that
he
said
have
significant
merit,
but
most
decisive
in
your
determination
your
honors
as
to
whether
or
not
this
jury
entered
that
jury
box
ready
for
their
voir
dire
unbiased
and
whether
or
not
you
should
pass
up
the
voir
dire
is
a
presumption
that
judge
blythin
was
an
honest
judge
and
intended
to
do
his
best
with
this
case
and
from
some
source
had
persuaded
himself
in
july
before
there
was
an
arrest
and
in
october
for
a
word
of
evidence
was
taken
solely
from
the
news
media
because
there
was
no
other
source
that
sam
sheppard
was
guilty
as
held
but
worse
that
his
case
was
open
and
shut.
how
in
the
united
states
with
a
concept
of
due
process
anywhere
extent
cannot
judge
a
human
being
with
that
frame
of
mind
to
make
decisions
such
as
whether
a
continuance
or
change
of
venue
to
the
great
[inaudible]
of
newspapers
which
could
castigate
him
in
the
face
of
an
upcoming
election.
whether
or
not
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
that's
correct
your
honor.
my
answer
is
that
given
by
judge
weinman
in
the
footnote
to
his
opinion.
he
said,
if
the
defense
counsel
had
had
an
inkling
of
the
frame
of
mind
of
the
district
judge
which
he
did
not,
he
certainly
would
have
challenged.
these
statements
were
not
known
to
defense
counsel
and
mr.
garmone
in
his
deposition
said
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
long
before
he
knew
judge
blythin's
state
of
mind.
he
never
knew
it
until
he
died.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
it
came
out
accidentally
not
at
a
cocktail
party.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
but
because
miss
kilgallen
made
a
speech
when
i
was
in
the
audience.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
that
was
before
miss
kilgallen
even
got
to
town
your
honor,
before
the
jury
was
began
to
be
impaneled.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
the
--
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
mr.
corrigan
was
dead.
mr.
petersilge
was
not
interviewed
and
mr.
garmone
said,
if
i
had
known
about
that
state
of
mind,
i
would
have
insisted
that
he'd
be
challenged.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
that
is
the
state
of
the
record.
mr.
f.
lee
bailey
now
i
wish
to
mention
very
briefly
two
remaining
issues.
first,
on
the
lie
detector
evidence,
it
is
true
that
although
tardy
the
objection
was
made
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
that
sheppard
have
refused
the
lie
detector,
it
was
not
appealed
to
the
ohio
courts.
judge
blythin,
i'm
sorry,
judge
weinman,
i
believe
as
i
read
fay
against
noia
had
the
authority
if
he
saw
fit
to
interpose
as
a
bar
to
sheppard's
claim
of
this
constitutional
violation
waiver.
he
did
not
elect
to
do
so.
the
sixth
circuit
usurped
that
function
and
speculated
that
corrigan
wanted
the
jury
to
know
this
fact
and
therefore
waived
objections
to
his
admissibility.
i
think
this
was
unwarranted
and
i
think
it
was
error.
the
sixth
circuit
also
ruled
that
the
phone
calls
from
the
jurors
to
their
homes
which
were
not
monitored.
the
bailiffs
testified
that
they
could
only
hear
the
words
spoken,
not
the
words
received
by
the
jurors.
it
did
not
give
rise
to
a
presumption
of
prejudice
such
as
this
court
has
held
in
many
similar
circumstances
and
therefore,
although
the
district
judge
took
note
of
all
these
presumptions
and
did
not
require
petitioner
to
produce
the
evidence,
suddenly
in
the
circuit
court
we
find
that
we
should
have
and
therefore
we
are
foreclosed.
i
think
that
as
to
the
other
issues,
i
must
leave
them
to
the
brief
due
to
time
limitations.
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
paid
short
trip
to
the
district
judge's
opinion
that
they
took
away
his
power
to
find
the
facts
and
disregarded
it
as
you
will
find
in
their
amended
order
and
that
they
should
at
least
have
sent
the
case
back
for
remand
so
that
many
of
the
issues
not
yet
litigated
should
have
been
but
i
think
there's
more
than
enough
here
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
the
writ
and
i
think
that
dr.
sheppard
ought
to
be
retried
if
the
company
has
any
--
i'm
sorry,
the
county
has
any
stomach
for
this
case
left
within
the
60
days
allowed
by
the
district
judge,
i
thank
your
honors.
