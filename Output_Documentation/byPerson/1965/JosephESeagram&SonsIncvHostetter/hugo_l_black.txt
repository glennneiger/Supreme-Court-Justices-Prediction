justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
did
have
the
effect
of
raising
the
price
of
beverages
at
the
time
all
over
the
united
states.
would
you
say
that
was
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
the
reason
for
holding
it
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
doesn't
say
they
have
to
do
that,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
because
it
might
have
that
effect
and
violate
some
provisions
of
the
constitution,
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
the
legislature
we
read
each
year
and
found
out
what
was
the
lowest
price
at
which
liquor
has
been
sold
in
the
state
for
the
past
year
can
simply
fix
that
as
the
price
that
must
be
sold
out
in
new
york.
would
your
objection
--
constitutional
objection
be
the
same?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
think
it
had
the
right
to
fix
the
price
even
though
their
measurement
was
precisely
that
which
is
here
stated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
pretty
big
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
pretty
big
problem
with
whether
it
promotes
temperance,
so
that
would
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
lot
of
people
observed
an
idea
which
is
perhaps
no
good
that
if
you'd
make
them
pay
so
much
for
it,
that
it's
hard
to
pay
it,
that
they'd
drink
less.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wasn't
that
--
i
found
out
from
hearsay
of
course
only,
that
different
states
frequently
have
laws
which
require
the
same
brand
to
be
sold
at
different
prices.
and
maybe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
they
wanted
to
provide
that
this
might
still
be
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
the
object
was
to
see
that
new
york
didn't
get
pleased
in
the
price
of
liquor
they
had
then,
if
he
would
have
to
pay
and
compares
them
with
the
price
they
had
to
pay
in
other
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i've
heard
that
they
hadn't
quite
different
reasons
in
some
of
the
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
an
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unreasonable
assumption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
heard
some
suggestions
that
the
act
might
be
bad
as
confiscatory.i
assume
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
premature.
so,
that
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(inaudible)
this
time
it
would
be
confiscatory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
know
what
it
would
be
it
--
in
one
month.
and
ordinarily
in
the
rate
cases
before
you
hold
that
a
rate
confiscatory
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
to
show
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
(inaudible)
--
twenty-first
amendment?
what
--
how
could
your
law
be
interpreted
in
a
way
anyone
can
slash
into
the
argument
and
they
would
compel
liquor
people
or
liquor
dealers
to
conspire
with
others
to
violate
the
sherman
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
thinking
maybe
you
had
a
better
answer,
at
least
the
sherman
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
they
could
get
by
without
any
reasonable
field
of
having
the
sword
of
the
antitrust
act
over
them
if
they
have
made
this
on
the
ground
that
maybe
it
didn't
compel
them
to
conspire
with
somebody
else
to
fix
prices?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
could
--
you'd
lose
me
on
that
argument
if
you're
going
to
say
that
because
the
state
passes
a
law
of
some
kind
which
compels
somebody
to
violate
a
federal
law,
we
grew
up
to
see
whether
it's
reasonable.
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
could
conceive
of
circumstances
under
which
your
law
is
going
to
compel
people,
people
engaged
in
the
liquor
business,
to
conspire
with
one
another
to
fix
prices,
then
i
would
say
that
you
couldn't
get
out
on
the
ground,
well,
it's
reasonable
(inaudible)
be
compelled
to
do
that
because
new
york
wants
it
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like

justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
you
have
a
much
better
argument
than
the
ones
that
tried
to
defend
it
on
the
ground
that
new
york
would
not
be
compelling
