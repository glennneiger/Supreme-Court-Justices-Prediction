j.
brennan,

and
if
it's
fair
traded,
i
gather
you
--
the
consumer
may
get
no
break
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
--
wasn't
there
only
recently
another
4-3
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
i
understood
it,
sustained
in
the
face
of
this
statute
of
the
voluntary
fair
trading,
could
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
issue
was
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
that
statute,
what
do
you
call
it,
feld-crawford?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
been
repealed
by
implication
by
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
i
wonder
though,
mr.
daly,
have
we
kept
such
an
abstract
question
here
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
aside,
as
i
understand
your
exposition
to
it,
this
was
largely
a
consequence
of
conclusion
that
mandatory
price
seems
to,
did
not
at
all
control
the
consumption
of
alcohol.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
kept
up
the
price
but
it
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
purpose
of
keeping
up
the
price
as
i
understood
it
was
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
try
to
diminish
the
consumption
of
alcohol.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
failed,
apparently.
they
said
the
legislature
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
mean.
so
that,
this
was
not
a
good
device
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
keeping
down
the
consumption
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
liquor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
i
take
it,
if
the
idea
of
this
was,
since
it
didn't
work
to
keep
it
down
like
consumers
ought
not
to
get
any
--
have
to
pay
more
than
they
would
other
where,
other
states
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yet
isn't
it
--
yet
i
gather,
under
voluntary
fair
trading,
the
consumer
in
new
york
may
have
to
pay
a
lot
more
than
he
pays
in
new
jersey
anyway,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
aren't
we
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
law
--
this
law
has
not
yet
been
applied
at
all,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
that
recent
opinion
of
your
court
of
appeals
indicates,
i
thought
that
feld-crawford
would
allow
the
$10
price.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
understand
it's
not
involved
in
this
part.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
this
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
argument
was
rejected
by
the
majority.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
new
york
said
that
the
distiller
didn't
sell
to
the
wholesaler
but
directly
to
the
retailer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
define
the
distiller
in
that
situation
as
a
wholesaler?
the
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
define.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
provision
of
the
constitution
that
violate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
due
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
we're
getting
back
now
to
the
1930s
again
and
before
application
of
due
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
that
fight
was
over.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
--
so
you
would
concede
the
state
could
do
that
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
conglomerate,
you
mean
confusing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
section
9
(f)
would
apply
in
the
case
of
direct
sales
from
a
distiller
to
retailer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
distiller
in
that
instance
is
the
wholesaler
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
purpose
of
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
not
only
the
wholesaler,
it's
also
the
so-called
related
person,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
the
distiller
know
about
this
prices
charged
by
the
related
person?where
does
he
get
that
information?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
gather,
with
the
wholesaler
being
--
obviously
has
the
records
--
relationships.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
he
with
the
related
person?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
concern
of
the
--
to
the
court,
at
least
to
where
the
argument
is
made
by
--
you're
--
rather
in
our
position
is,
that
new
york
simply
hasn't
got
the
power
to
pass
legislation
that
would
result
in
raising
the
prices
to
consumers
in
nebraska.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
argument
is
made
that
because
of
the
economic
facts
of
life,
that
is
precisely
what
would
happen
and
then
what
--
that
this
new
york
legislation
is
going
to
result
in
raising
prices
to
consumers
in
south
dakota,
nebraska,
and
what
have
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
new
york
is
without
any
such
power.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
hasn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
not
--
