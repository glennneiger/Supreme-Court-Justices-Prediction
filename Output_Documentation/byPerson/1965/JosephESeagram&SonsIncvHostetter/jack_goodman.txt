mr.
jack
goodman
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jack
goodman
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
segments
of
the
industry.
there's
the
distiller,
there's
the
wholesaler
and
basically,
there's
the
retail
package
store.
what
new
york
has
said
in
substance
is
this.
that
the
distiller
that
sells
to
the
wholesaler
in
new
york
cannot
charge
him
any
more
than
he,
the
distiller,
or
someone
whom
he's
designated
to
sell
for
him
to
other
wholesalers
sells
for
in
another
state.
mr.
jack
goodman
if
the
distiller
sells
to
the
retailer,
he
would
then
be
called
a
wholesaler
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute
and
then
he
could
not
sell
any
for
any
higher
price
than
a
wholesaler
in
another
state
is
selling
to
retailers.
he
would
then
fall
under
subdivision
(f)
rather
than
subdivision
(d).
subdivision
(d)
is
intended
to
cover
distiller
to
wholesaler.
subdivision
(f)
is
intended
to
cover
wholesaler
to
retailers.
mr.
jack
goodman
it
--
mr.
jack
goodman
it
talks
in
terms
of
sales
to
retailers.
in
other
words,
you
can
sell
to
a
retailer
in
new
york
under
subdivision
(f)
for
any
higher
price
than
a
sale
to
any
retailer
at
any
time
during
the
preceding
month
in
any
other
state.
so
that
they're
talking
about
the
method
of
doing
business
rather
than
the
definition
and
that's
in
the
essence
what
new
york
has
said
here.
that
the
distiller
must
sell
to
the
wholesaler
at
no
higher
price
than
distillers
or
his
agent
sell
to
wholesalers
in
other
states,
and
wholesalers
in
new
york
must
not
sell
to
retailers
for
any
higher
price
than
sales
are
made
to
retailers
in
other
states
at
any
time
in
any
one
sale.
mr.
jack
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
goodman
yes,
sir.
we
are
not
permitted
to
have
an
interest
in
the
retail
business.
when
i
say
we,
i'm
speaking
primarily
now
for
the
wholesalers
who
are
the
appellants
here.
mr.
jack
goodman
he
certainly
is.
he
can't
sell
for
any
higher
price
than
sales
are
being
made
to
retailers
in
other
states
during
the
preceding
month.
now,
when
i
say
the
preceding
month,
our
statutory
scheme
is
setup
this
way.
i
must
file
my
price
on
the
10th
of
this
month
as
a
wholesaler
selling
to
retailers
for
every
sale
that
i'm
going
to
make
in
the
next
succeeding
month,
and
it
becomes
effective
on
the
first
of
the
first
of
the
next
succeeding
month.
but
what
this
statute
has
done
is
to
say
that
my
price,
for
example,
filed
on
february
10th
for
my
march
sales
to
retailers
must
not
be
higher
than
the
price
at
which
merchandise
was
sold
in
other
states
to
retailers
during
january.
there's
a
two-month
flag.
now,
speaking
for
the
wholesaler,
what
i'm
--
our
basic
position
is
that
this
is
unconstitutional
in
terms
of
the
wholesaler
doing
business
in
new
york
state
because
his
price
is
being
governed
and
is
a
maximum
price,
not
a
minimum
price.
his
price
is
being
governed
by
price
that
is
being
set
in
32
other
states
by
any
number
of
wholesalers
and,
yes,
even
by
the
liquor
commission,
say,
in
the
state
of
minnesota
or
the
state
of
kansas
or
the
state
of
new
mexico.
mr.
jack
goodman
we
feel
that
this
is
in
violation
of
article
14.
mr.
jack
goodman
due
process.
mr.
jack
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
goodman
well,
we
feel
this,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
jack
goodman
we
feel
that
--
while
this
court
has
given
the
states
great
power
in
terms
of
fixing
prices
in
many
industries,
and
they're
all
cited
in
the
appellee's
briefs,
whether
it's
tobacco
commissions
or
whether
it's
insurance
or
whether
it's
the
theater
tickets
that
came
up,
at
least
in
those
cases
you
had
the
legislature
sit
down
and
either
itself
or
through
an
administrative
agency,
fix
the
price.
mr.
jack
goodman
i
would
say
that
the
legislation
--
mr.
jack
goodman
i
would
say
that
--
if
it
said
that
it
automatically
had
to
follow
the
lowest
price
around
the
country,
that
that
would
be
in
invalid.
mr.
jack
goodman
if
we
said
that
it
had
to
be
reasonable,
if
we
said
that
it
had
to
--
it
could
take
it
into
consideration,
yes.
but
that
--
to
take
automatically
the
lowest
price
fixed
by
any
wholesaler
in
an
individual
sale,
not
his
whole
month
sale
but
in
an
individual
sale,
if
for
some
reason
he
wanted
to
give
away
the
liquor
for
below
cost
with
no
relationship
to
the
conditions
that
do
--
that
are
obtained
here
in
new
york
that
this
is
not,
we
think,
sanctioned
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
jack
goodman
i
think
that
--
yes,
those
are
--
the
--
those
are
basically
the
problems
of
the
distiller.
i'm
talking
now
basically
with
the
problems
of
the
wholesaler.
what
the
distiller
in
basically
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
goodman
no,
the
wholesaler
doing
business
strictly
in
new
york,
i
don't
think
has
a
commerce
question
involved
here
at
all.
i
don't
think
it
has
--
mr.
jack
goodman
most
of
the
wholesalers
here
are
local.
some
may
do
business
in
two
states,
but
most
of
them
here
are
doing
business
strictly
in
new
york.
they
do
not
do
business
in
other
states
and
that
basically
this
is
it.
in
other
words,
what
our
legislature
has
said
here
is
blindly
take
the
lowest
price
that
you
found
for
example
in
any
place
in
the
country
during
the
month
of
january
and
that
price
automatically
becomes
the
highest
price
at
which
any
wholesaler
in
new
york
can
sell
it
during
the
month
of
march
with
no
concern.
for
example,
in
many
of
these
states,
they'll
let
the
--
the
wholesaler
may
give
quantity
discounts
unlimited,
but
our
statute
says
that
we
can
only
give
a
2%
quantity
discount.
in
other
words,
we're
operating
in
entirely
different
arenas,
the
wholesaler
in
new
york
from
the
wholesaler
in
other
states.
and
the
argument
of
the
brief
of
the
state
is
this.
they
say
we're
all
part
of
one
big
family,
one
big
industry
and
therefore
i
am
bound
by
what
the
wholesaler
in
another
state
has
done.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
this
community
of
responsibility
that
the
wholesaler
in
new
york
has
got
to
be
bound
by
the
conditions
that
have
--
that
prevail
with
respect
to
the
wholesalers
in
the
rest
of
the
country.
mr.
jack
goodman
during
the
time
that
the
moreland
commission
was
investigating
and
recommending,
the
minority
leader
of
the
senate,
and
it's
in
the
record,
proposed
a
bill
which
would
have
limited
the
law
only
with
respect
to
the
distiller
level
to
the
wholesaler.
in
other
words,
the
distiller
could
not
sell
to
the
wholesaler
for
any
higher
price
than
he
was
selling
in
another
state.
and,
in
none
of
the
legislative
history
was
there
any
intent
or
coverage
of
the
wholesaler
doing
business
strictly
in
new
york.
those
are
the
zuretski
bills
and
they're
included
in
the
record
here.
mr.
jack
goodman
what
--
mr.
jack
goodman
i
suppose
that
there
is
an
underlying
assumption
that
if
you
depress
the
price
at
the
top
from
the
distiller
to
the
wholesaler,
and
if
you
depress
the
price
from
the
wholesaler
to
the
retailer,
then
somehow
it
might
seep
through
to
the
consumer,
although,
before
the
lunch
recess,
it
was
brought
out
that
the
feld-crawford
act
which
still
permits
the
distiller
to
fix
the
price
at
which
the
retailer
sells
to
the
consumer
--
mr.
jack
goodman
--
is
still
in
effect.
mr.
jack
goodman
he
can
fix
the
price
i
think
under
new
york
law.
mr.
jack
goodman
he
can
fix
the
price
or
he
can
set
--
mr.
jack
goodman
or
he
can
--
usually,
it's
been
a
minimum
but
he
could
actually
set
the
act
--
our
feld-crawford
law
sets
the
price.
mr.
jack
goodman
that
may
have
been
the
reason
why
the
theory
was
that
if
you
depressed
it
at
the
top
and
at
the
second
level,
it
may
seep
through
even
though
the
control
at
the
level
from
retailer
to
consumer
was
still
maintained
in
the
distiller
under
feld-crawford,
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
still
in
effect.
mr.
jack
goodman
i
don't
think
it's
an
unreasonable
assumption.
mr.
jack
goodman
not
covered.
mr.
jack
goodman
none
of
them
are
applicable.
mr.
jack
goodman
it's
growing.
mr.
jack
goodman
i
would
say
that
it
may
be
as
much
as
20%
private
legal
business
in
new
york
state.
mr.
jack
goodman
the
private
label
business
in
how
it
operates
in
many
ways,
it
may
not
come
through
a
conventional
wholesaler.
it
may
come
through
just
what
we
call
a
clearing
agent
who
merely
to
comply
with
the
law
is
in
the
shoes
of
a
wholesaler.
that
type
of
business
is
not
covered
by
section
101
(b)
to
which
these
amendments
were
directed.
was
that
--
mr.
jack
goodman
this
was
always
the
purpose
of
101
(b)
to
which
these
amendments
were
appended
and
it
is
still,
to
a
certain
extent,
i
suppose
basic
in
the
feld-crawford.
it
is
to
protect
the
brand
and
it
is
also
perhaps
to
protect
the
small
retailer
from
the
undue
competition
of
the
large.
that's
why
we
have
this
so-called
non-discrimination
statute
that
wholesalers
must
sell
to
all
retailers
for
the
same
amount
and
we
are
prohibited
from
giving
more
than
a
2%
discount
for
quantity.
mr.
jack
goodman
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
the
competition
with
the
private
brand
was
ever
suggested
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
of
limiting
the
maximum
price.
mr.
jack
goodman
if
i
can
sum
up
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
jack
goodman
if
i
can
sum
up
the
legislative
history,
i
can
say
this.
the
moreland
commission
said
that
we
don't
want
to
have
the
minimum
consumer
price
from
the
retailer
to
the
consumer
fixed
by
the
distiller
and
made
an
enforceable
--
required
enforceable
law
of
the
state.
they
didn't
want
to
put
the
prestige
and
the
power
of
the
administrative
agency
in
enforcing
the
minimum
consumer
from
retailer
to
consumer.
they
said,
“we're
perfectly
willing
to
have
the
distiller
have
all
of
the
trouble
that
he
has
in
going
into
a
court
of
equity
with
all
of
the
difficulties
of
getting
an
injunction
and
all
of
the
defenses
that
are
raised
by
the
violating
retailer,
namely
that
he's
not
doing
a
fair
and
equitable
job
of
enforcement
but
we're
not
going
to
make
it
a
law
that
we,
as
the
state,
are
going
to
enforce
through
our
administrative
agency.”
and
their
theory
was,
very
frankly,
they
looked
at
washington
d.c.
and
they
said
the
re
--
the
consumer
in
washington
d.c.
is
buying
liquor
cheap.
washington
doesn't
have
a
minimum
consumer
law.
ergo,
if
we
eliminate
the
minimum
consumer
law
in
new
york,
the
new
york
consumer
will
get
cheap
liquor.
mr.
jack
goodman
they
specifically
said,
your
honor,
in
their
recommendation
and
the
governor
said
it
in
the
message
to
the
legislature
at
the
special
session
that
we
are
still
going
to
leave
you
with
the
feld-crawford
law
and
in
the
vernacular
knock
your
brains
out
in
trying
to
enforce
the
minimum
consumer.
mr.
jack
goodman
there
is.
so
that
--
what
the
currents
were
in
the
--
it
may
not
be
relevant
but
the
haste
with
which
the
bill
was
passed
i
think
is
somewhat
indicative
of
what
took
place
in
new
york.
the
legislature
in
the
regular
session
rejected
the
whole
moreland
commission
proposal
and
in
the
special
session,
this
compromise
conglomerate
bill
was
passed.
mr.
jack
goodman
that's
all.
mr.
jack
goodman
no,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
jack
goodman
when
i
say
conglomerate,
there
were
so
many
other
sections
in
the
statute.
for
example,
they
said
they
eliminated
the
old
distance
requirements
that
we
used
to
have
before
package
stores.
they
abolished
the
minimum
consumer
and
then,
for
some
reason,
this
was
lumped
on
to
the
so-called
inhibition
on
the
top.
mr.
jack
goodman
both.
it's
a
prohibition
from
sale
if
there
is
a
--
the
technique
that
was
used
was
an
affirmation,
but
an
affirmation
is
the
technique
under
the
statute.
mr.
jack
goodman
but
actually
what
it
means
is
you
can't
sell.
mr.
jack
goodman
i
think
that
was
the
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
suggested,
whether
or
not
this
is
a
premature
matter
and
from
our
view
it's
not
premature.
we
think
that
when
the
statute
says,
“take
the
lowest
price
next
month
that's
fixed
by
any
wholesaler
in
any
state
or
any
administrative
agency
in
kansas
or
new
mexico
and
that's
going
to
become
your
price
next
month.”
we
have
the
elements
of
a
controversy
that
we
could
--
we
believe--
mr.
jack
goodman
well
--
mr.
jack
goodman
i
would
like
mr.
daly
to
have
a
few
minutes
to
talk
about
robinson-patman
act
but
basically,
his
argument
is
that
new
york
is
saying
that
you
can't
do
things
that
the
federal
statute
says
you
can.
and,
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
antitrust
law,
you're
saying
that
as
a
result
of
this
law,
the
distiller
will
have
to
engage
in
antitrust
activity
in
order
to
protect
the
new
york
market.
now,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
them
but
basically,
those
are
the
arguments.
i
think
that
this,
but
if
the
controversy
is
not
right
or
if
the
court
should
think
so,
in
a
sense
what
we've
got
to
do
is
wait
until
we
actually
have
to
apply
one
of
these
outlandish
prices
in
kansas
or
the
kansas
control
commission
and
then
start
a
new
action
on
the
ground
that
it's
confiscatory.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to
wait
for
that
point
when
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
is
such
a
complete
delegation
of
price
fixing
to
so
many
people
in
other
parts
of
the
country
with
whom
we
have
no
relationship.
now,
the
attorney
general
says
it's
not
price
fixing.
they
haven't
told
us
at
what
price
to
sell,
but
i
say
that's
playing
with
words.
they've
told
us
we
can't
sell
above
a
certain
price.
that's
our
maximum
price
and
it's
extent
in
32
states
and
could
be
on
any
one
sale
or
it
could
be
on
a
monstrous
sale
and
the
statute
says
that
you
have
to
eliminate
all
the
discounts.
now,
i
think
that
a
statute
which
on
its
face
has
that
construction
is
basically
unconstitutional
and
the
court
should
say
so
and
--
mr.
jack
goodman
--
let
the
legislature
try
another
way.
mr.
jack
goodman
off
hand,
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
jack
goodman
oh,
i
think
that
--
my
feelings
about
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
they're
--
that
they're
to
take
off
the
restrictions
in
connection
with
goods
coming
in
and
out
of
the
state,
but
the
frankfort
case,
i
think
the
--
this
court
has
said
that
the
sherman
act
in
the
--
is
still
in
existence
and
i
think
it
said
it
in
the
schwegmann
case
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
still
in
effect
and
the
state
laws
can't
go
haywire
with
respect
to
antitrust.
