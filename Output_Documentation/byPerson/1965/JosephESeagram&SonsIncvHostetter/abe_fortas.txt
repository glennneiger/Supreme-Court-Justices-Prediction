justice
abe
fortas
mr.
daly,
this
act
has
not
been
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
operation
at
all,
has
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
section
9.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
nevertheless,
do
you--
is
it
your
argument
that
despite
that,
the
specific
questions
are
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
daly,
i
--
are
there
some
states
which
have
state
monopolies
and
which
have--
justice
abe
fortas
--
similar
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
true
of
all
17?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
daly,
i
don't
read
this
way.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
read
the
statute
this
way,
i'm
sure
you're
correct.
you
should
help
me.
as
i
understand,
looking
at
a17,
the
definition
of
related
person,
the
difficult
part
is
in
(2).
justice
abe
fortas
(2).
now,
that
applies
--
see
if
this
is
correct.
that
applies,
as
i
read
it,
only
to
a
dealer,
let
me
call
him,
who
purchases
from
the
brand
owner
--
direct
from
the
brand
owner
or
from
a
wholesaler
designated
as
agent
and
who
sells
only
to
a
wholesaler
and
who
sells
--
he
has
to
be
selling
to
a
wholesaler.
you
look
above
that.
in
other
words,
your
last
statement,
if
i
correctly
understood
you,
you're
talking
about
a
related
person,
a
wholesaler
who
sells
to
a
retailer.
but
that
would
not
--
that
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
section
doesn't
apply
to
the
last
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
am.
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
also
use
related
person
--
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
use
the
term
“related
person”?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
looking
at
(f),
the
related
person
would
have
to
purchase
from
the
brand
owner
or
the
distiller
or
from
a
wholesaler
designated
as
agent.
justice
abe
fortas
and
to
be
current
under
(f),
the
related
person
would
then
sell
to
a
retailer.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
i
say,
wherever
he
is,
north
dakota
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
he
sells
to
a
retailer.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
does
that
related
person
wholesaler
could
file
in
new
york,
which
is
compared--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
would
filing
in
new
york
with
--
the
price
of
which
would
be
compared
with
this
north
dakota
price
would
be
a
filing
not
by
seagram,
let's
say
the
distiller,
but
by
the
wholesaler
in
new
york.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
new
york.
justice
abe
fortas
even
if
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
even
if
seagram
--
the
distiller,
is
not
engaged
in
selling
to
retailers
in
new
york?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
other
jurisdictions
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
there's
a
law
that
forbids
them
from
doing
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
that
is
not
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
of
your
time,
but
just
to
sum
this
up.
is
it
or
is
it
not
true
that
a
distiller
even
though
it
does
not
sell
to
retailers
in
new
york
state,
would
have
to
file
a
schedule
saying
that
nowhere
else
in
the
united
states
is
the
particular
brand
sold
by
wholesalers
to
retailers
at
less
than
it
is
in
new
york.
justice
abe
fortas
does
new
york
law
prohibit
the
ownership
of
retailers
by
distillers?
justice
abe
fortas
or
by
the
ownership
of
retailers
by
wholesalers?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
goodman
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
goodman,
what
happens
to
private
brand
liquors?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words
--
i
--
suppose
a
retailer
has
a
private
brand,
owns
a
private
brand,
then
none
of
these
provisions
of
section
9
apply?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
excludes
quite
a
lot
of
the
business,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
any
idea
what
percentage
it
is
in
new
york
state?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that,
a
distiller
can
sell
private
label
whisky,
let's
say,
to
a
wholesaler
and
a
wholesaler
can
sell
private
label
whisky
to
a
retailer
without
reference
to
prices
that
are
charged
elsewhere
for
the
same
quality.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
i
would
infer
from
what
you've
said
that
possibly
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
arrangement
in
section
9
is
to
help
the
smaller
retailer
in
his
sales
of
branded
whisky
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
a
small
retailer
has
been
hurt
by
the
competition
of
the
in-brand
or
the
private
brand
--
private
labeled
liquors
to
the
extent
that
these
revisions
in
section
9
result
in
his
getting
branded
merchandise
at
a
lower
price
would
make
them
more
competitive.
the
private
brands
that
macy's,
for
example,
sells
and
to
that
extent,
the
small
retailer
will
be
the
sister,
is
that
one
of
the
purposes
in
here?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
--
does
the
distiller
know
prices
at
which
retailers
sell
for
a
country,
a
branded
product?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
record
in
that
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
guess
we're
all
familiar
with
that
but
that's
another
step
from
that
to
burdening
a
distiller
with
criminal
responsibility
or
a
wholesaler
with
criminal
responsibility.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
event
that
he
--
that
there
are
some
sales
in
which
he's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
the
third
point
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
the
third
point
is
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
still
--
still
troubled
by
the
question
i
asked
you.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
it's
before
us
with
this
posture
of
the
case
but
has
been
argued
that
is
to
say,
whether
a
statute
--
whether
you
properly
charge
a
distiller
or
a
wholesaler
in
new
york
with
knowledge
of
all
wholesale
prices
for
that
brand
throughout
the
country.
