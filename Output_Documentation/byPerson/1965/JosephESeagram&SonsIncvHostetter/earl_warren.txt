chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
is

please?
chief

8?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
in
the
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
brief,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
got
it.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
daly,
may
i
ask
this
to
revert
just
a
moment
to
what
you've
gone
through
about
the
related
dealers.
and,
you
say
that
if
anyone
of
them
had
sold
for
less
than
the
regular
price
that
the
distiller
could
not
or
certainly
at
the
time
sell
this
liquor
in
new
york,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
apply
whether
he
received
any
rebates
or
anything
of
that
kind,
any
special
inducement
from
the
distiller
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
makes
no
difference
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
he
received
any
preference
of
any
kind
over
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
without
regard
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
any
--
any
preference
that
the
distiller
might
give.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
indication
that
new
york
had
been
discriminated
against?
chief
justice
earl
warren
vis-Ã -vis
the
other
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
you
didn't
have
the
related
dealer
provision
in
there
and
the
state
had
just
said
that
no
distiller
can
sell
his
liquor
in
new
york
if
he
gives
any
rebate
or
preference
to
anyone
that
he
does
not
give
to
the
state
of
new
york.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
new
york
could.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
goodman,
you
may
--
if
you
had
finished,
mr.
daly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have,
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
you
could
have
five
minutes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
daly,
you
may
now
have
your
five
minutes
if
you
wish.
and
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
rebuttal,
yes.
mrs.
--
ms.
toch,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
evidence
that
the
distillers
were
discriminating
against
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
wasn't
what
i
asked.
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
they'd
assert
--
determined
they
would
have
to
get
after
the
big
fellows.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
the
big
fellows,
i
suppose,
the
biggest
of
all
would
be
the
distillers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
any
evidence
that
or
did
do
it,
that
they
go
into
this
because
the
distillers
were
discriminating
against
new
york
in
the
prices
that
they
charged
them
as
compared
with
other
states
or
did
this
extra
cost
to
the
consumers
in
new
york
depend
on
something
that
was
in
the
state
of
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
i'm
asking
about
the
distillers.
was
there
any
evidence
if
they
were
discriminating
against
new
york?
could
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
whose
fault
was
that?
was
that
the
distiller
or
the
wholesaler?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
thing
that
concerns
me
is
this.
if
there's
no
evidence
or
no
practice
in
the
industry
that
would
show
that
the
distillers
were
discriminating
against
the
wholesalers
in
new
york
and
the
price
in
new
york
to
the
consumer
was
still
a
dollar
--
a
dollar
and
a
half
higher
than
in
other
states,
how
would
it
help
that
situation
if
the
state
required
the
distiller
to
sell
it
at
a
still
lower
price
to
the
wholesaler?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
could
see
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
easy
enough,
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
they
were
charging
--
if
the
distillers
were
charging
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
wholesalers
more
than
they
did
in
other
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
only
reason
i
asked
the
question
was
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
i
recall
it,
that
the
legislative
--
the
legislature
determined
that
the
only
way
they
could
solve
this
problem
was
to
get
at
the
big
fellows.
now,
i
want
to
know
what
the
big
fellows
have
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
this
litigation
is
premature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
daly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
