mr.
thomas
f.
daly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
determined
by
a
divided
vote
4
to
3,
judgments
on
the
appellate
division
and
of
the
special
term
holding
--
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
certain
provisions
of
section
7
and
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
entirety
of
section
9
of
the
chapter
431
of
the
laws
of
new
york
of
1964.
my
remarks
here
are
going
to
be
directed
entirely
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
section
9.
i'll
leave
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
section
7,
because
of
the
limitations
of
time,
to
my
brief.
the
parties
involved
here,
the
appellants
are
in
three
categories.
the
first
are
the
most
of
the
distillers
who
sell
liquor
throughout
the
united
states.
they
will
be
referred
to
here
either
as
distillers,
manufacturers,
or
the
owners
of
the
brand
name.
also,
appellants
here
are
importers
of
liquor
from
other
countries
who
sell
here.
they
will
be
referred
to
either
as
the
brand
owners
or
as
importers.
also
as
appellants,
are
wholesalers
who
sell
the
liquor
of
the
various
whole
--
importers
and
distillers
exclusively
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
jack
goodman,
who
is
associated
with
me
in
this
case,
will
at
the
conclusion
of
my
remarks
have
some
remarks
to
make
concerning
the
new
york
wholesalers.
now,
before
i
get
into
a
discussion
of
section
9
and
what
it
entails
and
why
we
think
it
is
unconstitutional,
i
would
like
to
review
briefly
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
of
new
york
state
because
i
think
with
an
understanding
of
what
has
gone
before,
it
will
be
more
readily
apparent
why
we
believe
and
urge
that
section
9
is
unconstitutional.
new
york,
like
most
of
the
other
states,
after
repeal
in
1933
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
temperance
and
at
least
to
limit
the
social
evils
that
flow
from
unrestricted
consumption
of
alcohol
past
an
alcoholic
beverage
control
law.
that
law
still
continues
in
effect
with
various
amendments
which
i
am
going
to
mention.
sometime
in
the
late
1940s,
the
legislature
apparently
felt
that
the
distillers
and
some
of
the
wholesalers
were
taking
advantage
of
the
law
and
were
giving
discounts
and
other
things
that
weren't
helpful
to
restricting
the
evils
which
the
legislation
and
the
act
tried
to
prevent.
so,
at
that
time,
the
act
was
amended
to
provide
that
each
distiller
and
each
wholesaler
must
file
each
month
a
schedule
of
the
prices
at
which
they
were
to
sell
their
liquor,
that
is,
the
wholesaler
would
have
to
file
the
price
or
the
distiller
or
brand
owner
would
have
to
file
a
schedule,
they
are
called
postings,
and
they
were
publicly
displayed
which
would
show
the
price
that
his
commodity
was
being
sold
throughout
the
state
to
wholesalers
and
it
had
to
be
sold
to
every
wholesaler
at
that
price,
less
certain
discounts
which
were
provided
for
in
the
law.
likewise,
the
wholesaler
had
to
file
each
month
a
schedule
which
would
show
the
prices
at
which
he
would
sell
to
retailers
anywhere
in
the
state,
and
they
had
to
abide
by
those
prices.
in
other
words,
there
couldn't
be
competition
between
wholesalers,
there
could
be
competition
between
wholesalers
but
there
couldn't
be
competition
between
one
wholesaler
and
various
retailers.
wholesalers,
after
they
had
posted
their
prices,
however,
within
10
days
after
the
original
posting,
if
they
saw
that
another
wholesaler
was
selling
the
same
brands
for
less,
could
then
reduce
his
price
to
the
price
of
the
other
wholesaler
so
there
was
competition
as
between
wholesalers
but
no
competition
as
between
wholesalers
and
retailers.
now,
that
law
went
on
until
the
early
1950s
or
the
late
1940s
and
then
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
only
the
contractual
fair
trade
pricing.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
during
all
this
period,
they
could
fair
trade
by
contractual
arrangements,
but
that
was
the
only
control
on
consumer
prices.
now,
in
the
late
40s,
it
was
discovered
that
there
was
a
price
war
going
on
that
in
spite
of
price
control,
the
contractual
price
control,
a
price
war
is
going
on
and
retailers
and
other
people
were
selling
liquor
in
a
way
that
the
legislature
felt
again,
was
not
carrying
out
the
objects
of
temperance
and
controlling
the
evils
that
are
thought
to
flow
from
the
unrestricted
sale
and
consumption
of
liquor.
so
at
that
time,
the
legislature
passed
an
act
which
became
law,
which
made
price
control
mandatory,
and
they
did
that
for
the
expressed
purpose
and
i
quote
--
i
don't
quote
this,
i
read
this,
as
a
result
and
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
price
wars
“which
unduly
stimulate
the
sale
of
liquor
and
wine,
mandatory
price
control
will
be
adopted.”
now,
what
mandatory
price
control
was,
the
state
said,
the
alcohol
--
we,
the
distiller,
the
wholesaler
--
the
price
set
by
the
distiller
for
the
sale
and
retail
of
the
brand
named
product
will
be
enforced
by
the
state.
in
other
words,
the
alcoholic
control
board
would
enforce
that
and
for
instance,
if
a
retailer
sold
at
a
price
that
was
fixed,
a
price
below
what
it
was
fixed
by
the
manufacturer,
his
license
could
be
taken
away
or
it
could
be
otherwise
disciplined
by
the
alcoholic
control
board.
it
wasn't
left
to
private
enforcement
and
that
was
to
a
logic
stand,
very
effective
in
keeping
prices
pegged
by
the
distiller
and
there
was
no
selling
below
cost.
now,
we
get
down
to
1960
and
for
various
reasons
unconnected
with
what
i'm
discussing
now,
a
scandal
broke
out
in
the
liquor
authority
in
new
york.
it
reached
such
proportions
that
governor
rockefeller
felt
that
it
should
be
investigated
and
he
appointed
under
an
act
known
as
the
moreland
act,
he
appointed
commissioners
to
make
a
study
of
the
alcoholic
control
board
laws
and
what
could
be
done
to
eliminate
large
fields
of
discretion
which
apparently
brought
about
this
corruption.
he
is
the
governor,
appointed
three
distinguished
citizens
of
new
york.
the
chairman
was
former
judge
walsh,
who
was
also
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
they
conducted
long
hearings
and
investigated
the
whole
abc
law
and
came
up
with
a
number
of
conclusions,
most
of
which
have
no
bearing
here.
but
among
the
conclusions
they
came
up
with
was
that
new
york
state
or
the
citizens
of
new
york
state
were
paying
about
a
dollar
a
quart
or
a
dollar
a
fifth
more
for
liquor
throughout
the
--
in
the
state
and
than
was
being
charged
to
citizens
of
the
other
states.
now
and
they've
--
they
said
that
the
reason,
and
this
is
awfully
important
(inaudible)
--
i
want
to
impress
it
on
the
court,
the
reason
that
new
york
citizens
were
being
charged
more
than
citizens
of
other
state
was
because
of
the
mandatory
price
control
provisions.
and
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
findings
of
the
commission
as
they
appear
in
the
record
or
the
recommendations
of
the
committee,
and
i
refer
to
page
157
of
the
record,
and
here's
their
conclusion,
“for
all
of
the
foregoing
reasons,
we
have
concluded
that
section
101
(c),”
and
section
101
(c)
was
the
mandatory
price
control
provisions
of
the
law,
“injures
the
new
york
consumer
in
at
least
three
important
ways,”
and
then
it
goes
on
to
talk
about
the
price
to
the
consumer
in
new
york
being
higher
and
the
elimination
of
free
competition
and
having
a
competitive
market
in
new
york.
they
recommended
to
the
governor
and
to
the
legislature
that
this
mandatory
price
provision
be
eliminated
from
the
law,
and
they
said,
and
it
was
their
conclusion,
that
if
this
was
done
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
intended
to
allow
contractual
fair
trading
to
continue,
it
was
their
finding
that
with
the
elimination
of
mandatory
price
control,
prices
in
new
york
would
seek
their
natural
level
and
the
discrimination
which
they
found
against
new
york
citizens
would
be
eliminated.
the
governor
went
along
with
that
and
a
bill
was
introduced
to
provide
for
the
elimination
of
mandatory
price
control,
as
well
as
the
elimination
of
other
practices
which
they
had
found
to
be
bad
and
which
do
not
concern
us
here.
and
the
governor
in
his
message
to
the
legislature,
and
that
appears
on
page
188
of
the
record
and
i'm
now
reading
from
the
first
--
second
full
paragraph,
such
a
compulsory
resale
price
maintenance
is
at
war
with
the
american
system
of
free
competition.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
the
result,
and
this
is
the
result
of
mandatory
price
control,
is
that
new
york
consumers
have
been
compelled
to
pay
on
the
average,
$1
more
per
fifth
of
liquor
than
they
would
have
to
pay
if
they
were
a
free
market.
and
then
goes
on
to
say
that
this
runs
about
150
million
a
year.
again,
i
emphasize
that
what
was
causing
this
difference
in
price
was
mandatory
price
control.
a
bill
was
submitted
to
the
legislature
which
contained
the
provision
eliminating
mandatory
price
control,
and
i
may
say
parenthetically
that
the
elimination
of
this
mandatory
price
control
does
not
apply
to
wine.
new
york
state
is
a
great
grower
of
wine
grapes
and
a
great
distiller,
a
manufacturer
of
wine.
so
apparently,
the
legislature
was
making
a
distinction
there
between
wine
and
other
alcoholic
beverages.
the
legislature
however,
rejected
the
bill
that
had
been
introduced
by
the
governor,
and
a
new
bill
was
introduced
which
was
in
all
respects,
about
the
same
except
for
the
addition
of
section
7,
which
i
have
referred
to,
and
section
9.
now,
those
were
incorporated
in
the
new
bill.
the
act,
which
became
law
and
which
we're
attacking
now
appears
in
the
appendix
commencing
at
a5
but
if
your
honors
would
turn
to
page
a16,
this
is
where
we
really
get
into
the
part
that
we're
attacking.

appendix
to
our
brief,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.

do
you
have
it,
sir?
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
in
enacting
section
9
and
in
eliminating
mandatory
price
control,
this
is
what
the
legislature
said,
and
i'm
reading
now
at
the
bottom
of
paragraph
8.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
8
or
section
8,
as
it
appears
on
page
a16.
in
order
to
forestall
possible
monopolistic
and
anticompetitive
practices
designed
to
frustrate
the
elimination
of
such
discrimination,
that
is
the
discrimination
caused
by
mandatory
price
control
and
disadvantage.
it
is
hereby
further
declared
that
the
sale
of
liquor
should
be
subjected
to
certain
further
restrictions,
prohibitions
and
regulations,
and
the
necessity
for
the
enactment
of
the
provisions
of
section
9
of
this
act
is
therefore
declared
a
matter
of
legislative
determination.
now,
it's
--
now,
let
us
get
into
what
section
9
provides.
as
i
mentioned
before,
each
month,
the
manufacturer
or
brand
owner
of
(inaudible)
--distillers
first
must
post
a
pricelists,
so
must
the
wholesale.
now,
section
9
provides
that
in
connection
with
the
posting
of
both
those
pricelists,
the
manufacturer
or
brand
owner
must
also
file
an
affirmation
or
an
affidavit
that
the
prices
of
the
bottle
and
case
price
of
each
brand,
and
each
distiller
may
have
50,
100,
200
brands
which
he
files
for
each
month
and
each
wholesale
up
may
have
the
same
amount.
that
each
bottle
and
case
price
of
each
particular
brand
has
been
sold
throughout
the
united
states
either
as
far
as
the
sale
from
the
distiller
to
the
wholesaler
at
no
higher
price
than
it
has
been
sold
either
by
the
distiller
or
by
a
related
person,
and
i
will
get
to
the
definition
of
a
related
person
later,
at
no
higher
price
than
that
liquor
has
been
sold
by
the
distiller
or
a
related
person
anywhere
in
the
united
states
in
the
previous
month.
and,
with
respect
to
the
wholesaler,
the
distiller
must
also
file
his
affirmation
that
the
price
at
which
the
wholesaler
is
selling
to
the
retailer
is
no
higher
than
that
particular
item
of
liquor
was
sold
anywhere
in
the
united
states
in
the
preceding
month
by
either
the
distiller,
if
he
sold
to
retailers,
or
by
any
related
wholesaler
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
now
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
the
consumer
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
except
that
the
law
does
provide
that
the
retailer
must
not
sell
below
his
cost
and
the
cost
as
defined
there
is
the
cost
to
the
retailer,
the
actual
purchase
price
not
including
any
discounts.
so,
it
can't
be
sold
below
the
retailer's
cost
but
that's
the
only
limitation
except
as
it
may
be
fair
traded
--
contractually
fair
traded.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
he
may
not,
although
i
must
say,
your
honor,
as
you
probably--
and
i
refer
you
to
the
decided
opinions
in
new
york
since
mandatory
price
control
has
been
in
effect,
the
decided
cases
indicate
that
fair
tra
--
contractual
fair
trading
has
not
been
nearly
as
effective
as
mandatory
price
control.
mr.
thomas
f.

mr.

no,
i
don't
think
they
went

far,

honor,
but
i
merely
cite
these
cases
to
indicate,
because
my
adversary
takes
a
somewhat
different
position
and
i'll
get
to
that
later,
that
contractual
price
control
has
not
been
wholly
effective
in
keeping
prices
up.
mr.
thomas
f.

i
don't
think
so,

honor.
i
think
it's
not
at
all
abstract.

(inaudible)
no,
no.

price
control
kept
up
the
price
in

mr.
thomas
f.

kept
up
the
price.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
were
to
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
no,
the
moreland
act
commission
and
perhaps
i
should've
mentioned
this
earlier,
found
that
the
price
of
liquor
had
no
relation
to
consumption.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
well
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
right,
the
price
control
was
not
necessary
to
further
the
aims
of
temperance.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
right.
well,
the
moreland
act
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
conceivably
he
could,
of
course
the
cost
of
doing
business
in
new
york
is
considerably
higher
than
it
is
in
other
states
so
that
he
still
even
with
free
competition,
it
might
end
up
that
the
consumer
paying
more
and
i
don't
think
this
bill
is
going
to
eliminate
it.
what
it's
going
to
do
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
is,
probably
result
in
raising
prices
throughout
the
united
states
rather
than
reducing
them
in
the
state
of
new
york.
this
isn't
at
all
an
academic
discussion.
it
had
very
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
--
real
repercussions
--
mr.
thomas
f.

it
has
not
been
applied
because
it's
been
stayed
all
the
way
up,

and

was
stayed

thomas

harlan
pending
this
review.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
sir?
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
you're
leaving
out
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes,
yes,
i
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i
think
it
would
be
because
i
think
it
would
be
a
serious
effect
on
the
other
states
to
say
that
--
well,
as
the
attorney
general's
many
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
no,
they
don't
have
to
do
it
but
new
york
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
violates
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
it
violates
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
it
violates
the
supremacy
clause.
i
think
it
interferes
with
the
operation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
it
interferes
with
the
operation
of
the
robinson-patman
act
as
i
hope
to
develop
as
we
go
along.
in
other
words,
section
9
was
not
passed
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
prices.
the
legislature
and
the
moreland
act
commission
believed
that
the
elimination
of
mandatory
price
control
would
do
that.
as
i
said,
section
9
which
we're
complaining
about
here
was
passed
in
order
to
forestall
possible
monopolistic
practices
designed
to
frustrate
the
elimination
of
such
discrimination
and
disadvantages
that
section
9
--
that
was
the
reason
for
the
enaction
--
adoption
of
section
9.
now,
let
me
read
to
you
what
a
related
person
is
and
it's
the
related
person,
your
honors,
who
really
fix
the
price
of
liquor
in
new
york
state.
a
related
person
shall
mean
(1),
and
i'm
reading
from
page
a17
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
under
(d)
there,
down
towards
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph,
shall
mean
(1)
--
shall
mean
any
person,
(1)
in
the
business
of
which
such
brand
owner
or
wholesaler
designated
as
agent
has
an
interest
direct
or
indirect
by
stock
or
other
security
ownership
as
lender
or
lienor,
or
by
interlocking
directors
or
officers,
or
(2)
the
--
and
this
is
the
really
important
phrase,
the
exclusive
principle
or
“substantial
business
of
which
is
a
sale
of
a
brand
or
brands
of
liquor
purchased
from
such
brand
owner
or
wholesaler
designated
as
agent,
and
the
same
definition
applies
to
sales
from
wholesalers
to
retailers.”
so,
in
other
words,
you
can
have
throughout
the
united
states
not
the
distiller
fixing
this
price,
not
the
wholesaler
fixing
this
price
but
some
so-called
related
person
who
is
some
independent
person
who
does
a
substantial
amount
of
business
in
a
particular
brand.
there's
no
definition
about
a
substantial
amount
is.
the
amounts
of
brands
may
run
--
a
particular
distiller
which
a
particular
wholesaler
sells
may
run
anywhere
from
75%
down
to
1%
and
we
don't
know
what
that
means.
now,
let
me
also
show
the
definition
of
price
and
i
again,
i
move
over
to
a19
(i).
in
determining
the
lowest
price
for
which
any
item
of
liquor
was
sold
in
any
other
state
or
the
district
of
columbia,
appropriate
reductions
shall
be
made
to
reflect
all
discounts
in
excess
of
those
to
be
in
effect
under
such
schedule
and
all
rebates,
free
goods,
allowance,
and
inducements
of
any
kind
whatsoever
offered,
note
that
offered,
or
given
to
any
such
wholesaler.
now,
it's
not
only
the
price
at
which
some
related
person
might
sell,
but
the
price
at
which
he
might
have
offered,
although
sale
had
not
been
made.
and
these
independent
wholesalers
are
completely
independent
of
the
distillers
so
that
some
wholesaler
out
in
some
state
in
the
middle
west
or
anywhere
else,
if
he
offers
a
brand
of
liquor,
even
if
he
sells
below
cost
if
he
offers
that
brand
in
that
particular
month,
that
is
the
price,
at
a
price
that's
even
below
cost,
that
is
the
price
at
which
that
brand
of
liquor
must
be
sold
in
new
york
two
months
later
because
you
have
to
first
file
your
schedule
and
the
affirmation
for
the
price
of
the
previous
month
at
which
you're
going
to
sell
in
the
succeeding
month.
so,
two
months
later,
new
york
must
sell
that
brand
of
liquor
at
the
price
that
this
related
person
wholesaler
sold
somewhere
in
the
united
states
and
that
includes
all
rebates
which
a
state
might
--
some
other
state
might
allow
and
which
new
york
doesn't.
new
york,
incidentally,
it
counts
for
about
12%
of
the
liquor
market
in
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
sir?
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
oh,
the
act
has.
section
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
--
section
9
had
been
stayed,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
oh,
yes.
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
oh,
yes,
regulations
were
issued
and
the
state
was
all
prepared
to
enforce
it,
and
it
would've
been
enforced
except
for
stays
and
during
a
certain
period
of
time,
by
the
voluntary
accusation
of
the
attorney
general's
office
in
lieu
of
a
stay.
and
then,
mr.
--
the
chief
judge
at
the
court
of
appeals,
after
the
decision
came
down,
entered
a
stay
pending
the
application
to
mr.
justice
harlan
for
a
stay,
which
you
then
granted
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
he
could
sell
it,
your
honor.
he
had
the
choice
of
either
not
selling
it
or
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
--
selling
it
at
the
price
that
was
fixed
by
this
affiliated
or
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
--
a
wholesaler.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
oh,
yes.
yes,
it
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
none
at
all.
it's
whatever
price
the
--
this
related
person
fixes
for
any
reason
that
he
wants
to
fix
it.
it
has
--
if
he
got
rebates
from
the
distiller,
that
would
also
have
to
be
taken
into
account,
that
is,
it's
the
price
at
which
--
it's
the
price
at
which
he
sells.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
and
he
gives
rebates
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
right.
he's
completely
independent
of
the
distiller
and
it's
a
price
at
which
he
sells
that
fixes
the
price
at
which
the
wholesaler
may
sell
to
the
retailer.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
no,
your
honor,
if
it
were
done
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
or
furthering
the
aims
of
temperance,
i
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
and
i
do
think
that
they
would
have
the
price
--
the
right
to
fix
the
price
of
liquor.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
right,
subject
to,
of
course,
aside
from
the
twenty-first
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
--
aside
from
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
don't
suppose
they
could
fix
the
price
of
liquor
at
a
confiscatory
price.
now,
i'm
leaving
out
the
twenty-first
amendment,
assuming
there
was
some
other
product
and
not
liquor,
i
don't
think
they
could
fix
it.
i
think
they
have
a
right
under
certain
circumstances
probably
to
fix
the
price
of
any
product
but
that
takes
in
consideration
due
process
and
the
other
constitutional
provisions
but
i
agree
with
you.
and,
if
it's
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
temperance,
i
think
they
undoubtedly
had
the
right
to
fix
the
price.
but
this,
as
your
honor
will
realize,
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
sir?
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
well
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes,
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
legislature
itself
does
not,
in
enacting
this
statute,
did
not
enact
it
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
temperance.
it
was
enacted
merely
to
prevent
anticompetitive
practices
which
might
prevent
the
citizens
of
new
york
receiving
the
benefit
which
the
moreland
act
commission
said
would
be
obtained
from
the
repeal
of
mandatory
price
control.
that
was
the
only
purpose
for
enacting
this.
it
wasn't
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
but
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
as
i
understand
the
rationale
of
all
those
other
states
which
fix
marked
up
prices,
it's
in
furtherance
of
the
promotion
of
temperance
and
the
object
--
objectives
of
unduly
--
not
unduly
stimulating
the
sale
of
liquor.
and
again,
i
emphasize
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
well,
i
don't
know
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
only
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
only
as
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
no,
only
as
i've
said,
your
honor,
as
a
result
of
mandatory
price
control.
the
moreland
act
commission
and
in
the
governor's
message
which
i
read,
said
that
because
of
mandatory
price
control,
the
price
of
liquor
was
somewhat
higher
in
new
york.
now,
the
--
as
the
commission
found,
there
was
some
evidence
or
a
lot
of
evidence
that
the
cost
of
doing
business
in
new
york
was
higher
than
in
other
states,
but
they
did
find
that
because
of
mandatory
price
control
that
new
yorkers
were
being
discriminated
against
it
but
that
presumably
is
eliminated
now
because
mandatory
price
control
has
been
eliminated.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes,
and
i'll
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i'll
discuss
that
right
now,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
states,
i've
forgotten,
the
record
shows,
i
don't
have
the
--
number
doesn't
come
to
mind
but
it's
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
17,
i
think,
your
honor
is
right,
in
which
the
state
acts
as
the
purchasers
from
the
manufacturers
to
the
distillers
of
the
alcoholic
spirits
and
they
in
turn
sell
it
within
the
state.
and,
they
inquire
--
they
require
warranties
that
the
price
at
which
they're
buying
is
the
price
is
no
higher
than
the
price
which
it
sold
in
other
states
by
the
manufacturers.
and
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i
think
it's
true
of
all
17.
the
warranties
and
some
are
different
from
the
others.
pennsylvania
has
about
the
broadest
warranty,
i
think.
and
my
adversary
uses
that
as
a
reason
why
there's
nothing
very
improper
in
what
new
york
state
has
done.
but
may
i
point
out
in
ref
--
with
reference
to
these
monopoly
states,
this
considerable
difference.
first,
it's
purely
contractual,
whereas,
the
law
here
is
--
if
a
violation
of
the
law
or
filing
of
a
false
affirmation
in
new
york
state
can
result
in
six
months
imprisonment
and
$10,000
fine
can
result
in
the
revocation
of
your
license
so
you
can't
do
business
in
the
state,
and
--
well,
in
short,
it
has
severe
(inaudible)
--
criminal
sanctions
which
the
monopoly
states
don't
have
that
is
it's
purely
contractual.
if
you
--
if
they
find
that
you've
sold
for
more,
they
could
start
a
suit
to
collect
from
you
and
tell
you
that
they
won't
buy
from
you
anymore
just
the
same
as
any
dealer
can.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
sir?
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
they
don't
have
the
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
well,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
and
i
see
my
five
minutes
are
going
and
may
i
also
say
that
we
don't
have
this
related
person
problem
because
as
the
price
of
the
monopoly
states,
it's
the
price
at
which
the
distiller
sells,
not
the
price
at
which
the
related
person
sells
or
to
whom
we
have
no
control.
that
is
the
--
that
is
one
of
the
broad
distinctions
between
the
monopoly
states
in
our
situation
where
we're
in
the
--
at
the
mercy
of
a
so-called
related
person
over
whom
we
have
no
control
at
all.
and,
thirdly,
none
of
the
monopoly
states
have
a
warranty
that's
as
broad
as
this
which
includes
inducements
of
any
kind
whatsoever
either
offered
or
given.
now,
in
summation,
and
i
really
can't,
because
of
the
limitation
of
time,
get
into
the
constitutional
arguments,
but
may
i
point
out
in
summary
that
under
this
section
9,
the
price
of
the
liquor
is
not
set
by
new
york
state.
it's
set
by
--
it's
not
set
by
statute.
the
price
is
not
set
by
the
brand
owner.
the
price
is
not
set
by
a
wholesaler.
the
price
is
set
by
some
related
person
somewhere
in
the
country,
over
whom
we
have
no
control.
and
that's
so
with
reference
to
the
price
by
the
distiller
to
the
wholesaler
and
the
price
by
the
wholesaler
to
the
retailer
with
one
exception,
a
retailer
may
sell
his
private
brand
without
any
price
restrictions
at
all.
a
private
brand
is
where
a
retailer
buys
from
a
wholesaler
or
from
a
distiller
and
sells
under
his
own
name,
that's
so-called
private
brand.
and
wine
does
not
come
under
these
prohibitions.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
the
price
at
which
liquor
would
have
to
be
sold
under
this
law
in
new
york
has
absolutely
--
may
have
absolutely
no
relation
to
the
price
at
which
liquors
should
be
sold
in
new
york.
as
i
said,
the
expenses
of
doing
business,
both
for
the
industry
and
for
the
wholesalers,
is
considerably
higher.
mr.
goodman
will
go
into
that,
so
i'll
leave
that
for
the
time
being.
and
it
may
have
no
relation
to
what
would
be
an
honest
and
fair
price
in
new
york
which
the
people
of
new
york
should
be
asked
to
pay
because
it's
the
price
of
selling
the
liquor
there.
and
it
may
have
no
relation
to
the
fair
price
at
which
the
liquor
is
being
sold
by
some
related
person
somewhere
in
the
country
because
for
some
reason
or
another,
to
meet
competition
in
brands
that
aren't
sold
--
even
sold
in
new
york,
he
may
sell
his
liquor,
as
he
can
lawfully
in
a
lot
of
states,
at
a
loss.
and
yet,
if
he
sells
out
of
loss
out
in
some
small
town
in
the
middle
west
where
his
costs
are
a
lot
less,
if
that
liquor
is
going
to
be
sold
in
new
york
and
new
yorkers
aren't
going
to
be
deprived
of
the
choice
of
their
favorite
brand,
it
must
be
sold
at
the
price
that
that
man
does
sell
it
somewhere
out
in
the
west,
but
a
person
over
whom
the
wholesaler
in
new
york,
or
to
whom
the
distiller
contrary
to
what
my
adversary
will
say
by
quotation
from
outside
the
record
in
which
i
will
hope
to
answer
in
rebuttal.
that
will
be
the
price
in
new
york
with
the
--
or
the
distiller
will
have
the
choice
of
saying
or
the
wholesaler
will
have
the
choice
of
saying,
“we're
not
going
to
sell
those
brands
in
new
york,”
and
the
new
york
consumer,
if
he
likes
that
brand,
can
go
to
new
jersey
or
connecticut
or
somewhere
else
to
buy
it
but
he
won't
be
able
to
buy
it
in
new
york.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i
think
new
york
could
do
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i
think
that
they
could
do
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
but
i
--
i
think
--
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i'm
afraid
that
it's
going
to
and
for
this
reason,
i
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i
think
it
will
have
to
and
because,
as
the
attorney
general's
committee
and
was
quoted
in
brief
at
page
40
and
i
think
it's
inevitable
economic
law
if,
as
a
result
of
reducing
your
price
to
one
person,
you
must
reduce
it
to
all,
the
result
is
going
to
be
that
you're
not
going
to
reduce
it
to
anyone.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
they
can
--
you
can
fair
trade
it
still
in
new
york.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
by
a
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
they
could
still
fair
trade
but
the
--
it
couldn't
be
sold
to
the
wholesaler
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
at
a
price
any
higher
than
it
was
sold
any
price
else
in
the
country
by
a
related
person.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
so
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
no.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that
it
got
--
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes,
but
you
see,
this
action
has
been
stayed.
this
section
is
not
in
effect,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
they
--
they
could
--
well,
they're
not
going
to
--
i
assume
that
if
they
have
to
sell,
say,
at
$2
a
quart
less,
they're
not
going
to
fix
the
retail
price
at
the
old
price
and
give
all
that
difference
to
the
retail.
i
assume
what
will
happen
would
be
the
price
would
be
reduced
all
along
the
line.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
it
would
--
well,
of
course
it
--
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
because
it
--
they
might
have
to
sell
in
new
york
at
a
higher
price
because
the
cost
of
doing
business
in
new
york
would
be
higher.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
oh,
they
--
they
couldn't,
your
honor,
if
section
9
is
in
effect
because
they
could
only
sell
it
at
the
price
at
which
some
related
person
--
wholesaler
somewhere
else
in
the
country
sold
it.
that
is,
suppose
a
related
person
wholesaler
sold
an
item
of
bourbon,
say,
which
was
selling
at
$10
in
new
york
in
this
particular
month.
that
same
brand
was
sold
somewhere
in
the
state
by
a
wholesaler
or
outside
the
state
by
a
wholesaler
at
$5.
two
months
from
now,
the
brand
owner
of
that
brand
would
have
to
file
an
affirmation
stating
that
the
re
--
the
wholesaler
who
was
selling
his
brand
to
retailers
were
selling
at
no
higher
price
than
the
price
of
$5
which
had
been
sold
in
this
other
state.
so,
it
couldn't
be
sold
from
(voice

--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
sir?
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
oh,
yes,
because
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
i
read
--
you
--
you're
reading
from
the
section
probably
that
refers
to
a
sale
from
a
distiller
to
a
wholesaler.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
it's
also
the
same
provision
where
the
sale
is
from
a
wholesaler
to
a
retailer.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
in
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
--
(i)
on
page
a19.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
or
(f),
i
should
say,
(f)
on
page
8.
there
are
two
sections,
you
see,
there's
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
there's
(d)
of
9
and
(f)
of
9.
one
applies
for
sales
from
the
distiller
to
the
wholesaler
and
the
other
applies
from
the
wholesaler
to
the
retailer.
in
both
instances,
the
affirmation
must
be
filed
by
the
distiller
or
brand
owner
that
the
price
of
which
the
liquor
is
being
sold
is
no
higher
than
the
price
sold
by
a
related
person.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
well,
a
related
person
may
not
be
doing
business
in
new
york
at
all,
he
wouldn't
be.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
he'd
be
a
related
person,
a
wholesaler.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
he
wouldn't
file
it
in
new
york.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
it
would
be
the
price
at
which
the
wholesaler
in
new
york
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
--
could
sell
to
a
retailer,
but
it
--
but
seagram,
if
it
was
this
--
if
it
were
the
brand
owner,
would
have
to
file
an
affidavit
or
an
affirmation
that
the
price
shown
on
the
wholesaler's
schedule
of
the
prices
to
retailers
was
no
higher
than
the
price
which
had
been
fixed
by
this
wholesaler
on
his
sale
to
retailers
out
in
dakota.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
if
even
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
seagram,
ordinarily
--
most
of
the
whole
--
most
of
the
distillers
do
not
sell
to
retailers
in
new
york.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
they
sell
it
to
wholesalers.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
no,
they
could
sell.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
there
are
instances.
in
fact,
the
section
itself
provides
that
--
for
sales
to
retailer
in
the
--
where
the
distiller
sells
to
retailer,
he
must
also
make
an
affirmation.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
that's
right.
as
long
as
it
was
related,
the
person
wholesaler
is
related
person
as
defined
in
this
section
anywhere
in
the
map.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
no,
because
the
price
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
the
price
would
be
set
by
a
"related
person"
wholesalers
who
sold
to
retailers
somewhere
else.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
what
--
that
case,
what
happened
there,
your
honor,
was
this.
as
i
recall
the
case,
i
remember
reading
it,
i
wasn't
involved
in
(inaudible).
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
one
of
the
distillers,
i
think,
was
trying
to
enforce
fair
trading.
macy's
and
some
other
stores
have
been
undercutting
and
some
of
the
retailers
were
undercutting.
macy's,
they
tried
to
enforce
their
fair
trade
contracts.
a
position
was
taken
by
some
of
the
retailers
that
these
distillers
weren't
coming
into
court
with
clean
hands
because
they
had
obtained
from
mr.
justice
harlan
the
stay
of
the
operation
of
section
9.
as
a
result,
prices
had
not
reached
the
level
that
the
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
--
moreland
act
committee
thought
it
should
and
therefore,
it
would
be
unconscionable
and
equity
should
not
enforce
those
fair
trade
contracts.
that
was
about
the
(inaudible)
--
the
majority
didn't
agree
with
it,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
the
argument
was
rejected
by
the
minor
--
minority
--
by
the
majority,
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
may
i
have
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
in
over
our
time?
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
thank
you
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
in
rebuttal,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
if
the
court
please,
on
the
question
of
prematurity
i
think
that
--
well,
when
this
action
was
brought,
the
state
was
just
implying
--
making
us
file
the
affirmations
and
everybody
who
filed
an
affirmation
took
the
risk
that
if
the
affirmation
were
false
they
might
end
up
imprisoned
for
six
months
with
a
$10,000
fine
and
all
the
other
consequences.
they
also
took
the
risk,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
of
perhaps
violating
the
sherman
act,
of
being
accused
of
violating
the
sherman
act
and
the
robinson-patman
act
and
other
provisions
of
law.
so
that
--
and
i
think
under
the
authorities
under
those
circumstances,
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
as
our
action
was,
is
entirely
proper
that
we
don't
have
to
wait
until
we've
been
convicted
of
a
crime
before
we
take
an
appeal.
i
think
it's
proper
to
test
out
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
the
circumstances
present
here
without
waiting
for
an
actual
conviction
and
--
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
well,
i
submit,
your
honor,
with
all
due
deference
that
these
are
not
abstractions.
that's
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
assume
the
consequences
that
are
going
to
flow
from
this
act,
and
i
think
that
we
point
them
out
in
our
brief.
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
them
now,
but
i
don't
think
that
they're
assumptions
without
a
sound
basis
and
i
don't
think
that
the
people
in
this
industry
should
be
subjected
to
the
penalties
that
will
accrue
if
they
do
violate
the
act
and
that
we
should
have
to
go
to
the
(inaudible)
root
cause
of
a
first
standing,
that
conviction
before
it's
brought
up.
now,
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
about
whether
there
was
any
finding
that
new
yorkers
were
discriminated
against
by
the
distillers,
there's
absolutely
no
finding
of
that
effect.
in
fact,
the
finding
that
the
--
of
the
commission
which
investigated
this
was
that
the
prices
in
new
york
were
due
solely
to
section
--
the
mandatory
price
resale
and
they
said
they
didn't
know
where
the
excess
price
that
they
said
was
charged
new
yorkers
because
of
mandatory
price
sale
--
retail.
they
didn't
know
where
the
difference
went.
they
said
that
they
assumed
that
some
of
it
went
to
the
retailers,
some
of
it
went
to
the
wholesalers,
and
some
of
it
may
have
gone
to
the
distillers,
but
they
really
didn't
know.
there's
no
question,
and
they
--
and
it's
supported
in
the
record
that
the
price
of
doing
business
in
new
york
is
considerably
higher
than
it
is
in
most
of
the
other
states,
and
that
the
profits
to
retailers
i
think
the
record
shows
in
this
state
is
0.66
per
dollar
of
sales
whereas
the
average
pri
--
profit
to
retailer
is
i
think
it's
in
the
record
but
my
recollection
is,
is
1.26.
so
that,
the
retail
profit
because
of
the
cost
of
doing
business
is
considerably
less
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
not
the
retailer
but
the
wholesaler.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
0.66
percentage.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
percentage,
yes.
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
f.
daly
and
supported
by
the
record.
and,
i
may
say,
your
honor,
that
mrs.
toch,
i'm
sorry
to
say,
was
going
completely
outside
the
record
when
she
says
that
the
distillers
have
complete
control
over
the
wholesalers.
what
she
is
in
fact
accusing
us
of,
violating
the
sherman
act
now
and
of
continuous
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
we
don't
have
control
over
these
wholesalers
and
there's
no
way
these
so-called
related
person
wholesalers
are
completely
independent
of
us,
and
if
we
tried
in
any
way
to
coerce
them
into
giving
us
their
prices
if
they
don't
want
to
give
it
to
us,
we'll
be
up
on
the
charges
of
violating
the
sherman
act
and
coercing
them.
we
have
no
control
over
them
whatsoever
and
there's
not
one
spit
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
we
have
and
it
just
stands
to
reason
that
we
can't
have
it.
and
in
fact,
this
legislation
that
we're
complaining
about
was
not
passed
in
the
legislative
declaration
as
here,
was
not
passed
because
distillers
were
charging
more
in
new
york
or
because
distillers
were
controlling
the
wholesale
price
in
new
york
or
that
the
distillers
had
control
of
the
wholesalers.
it
was
passed
as
the
legislate
--
as
it's
shown
on
page
16,
and
i
read
it
and
mrs.
toch
had
read
it
to
you.
in
order
to
forestall
possible
monopolistic
practices,
that
is,
practices
in
the
future.
