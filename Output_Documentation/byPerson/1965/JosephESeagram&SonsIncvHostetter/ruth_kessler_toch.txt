ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
is
that
this
law
is
an
enactment
within
the
authority
of
the
state
of
new
york
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
bolstered
by
the
police
power
as
applied
in
a
developing
concept
of
the
government's
concern
for
and
responsibility
and
duty
to
the
people
and
their
well-being
including
economic
well-being.
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
any
decision
of
this
court
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
including
the
idlewild
decision
and
the
bean
decision
then
does
--
that
does
other
than
support
the
validity
of
section
9.
i
think,
perhaps
when
--
i
might
do
now
is
clarify
some
of
the
things
that
have
been
said
about
this
law
and
its
purpose
and
its
history
and
the
new
york
wholesalers.
the
moreland
commission
decided
and
there
are
reports
and,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
can
send
--
get
together
one
set
and
send
them
down.
i
have
quoted
from
them
in
the
brief,
have
charts
in
the
brief
that
show
that
the
prices
in
new
york
state
were
higher
to
the
consumer
by
about
--
up
to
a
dollar
down
half
a
fifth
than
they
were
elsewhere
in
the
country.
and
these
were
brand
prices,
the
prices
largely
of
the
--
what
is
known
as
the
big-four
distillers
who
are
among
the
62
plaintiffs
and
appellants
in
this
case.
the
moreland
commission
concluded
that
the
prices
were
high
to
the
consumer
and
their
suggested
remedy
was
to
eliminate
the
consumer
resale
prices
enforced
by
the
state
liquor
authority
and
all
this
went
up
to
the
legislature
in
january
1964.
now,
every
--
in
other
words,
the
problem
was
in
the
consumer
--
in
the
moreland
commission
report.
it
was
found
in
the
moreland
commission
report.
they
had
the
recommendation
for
solving
this
problem.
then,
the
legislature
went
to
work
on
it.
there
was
a
joint
legislative
committee.
indeed,
the
same
committee
is
holding
hearings
right
now
to
find
out
why
the
prices
haven't
gone
down.
but,
there
was
this
joint
legislative
committee
back
here
and
they
had
hearings
and
the
retailers,
i
take
it,
got
busy.
everything
that
allege
--
that
leads
the
legislature
to
--
and
the
congress,
indeed,
to
adopt
the
law
is
not
necessarily
documented
or
recorded
but
they
found
out
and
people
are
telling
them,
and
they
are
educated
i
take
it
if
they
didn't
know
before
it
about
how
the
industry
operates
and
the
retailers
testified.
you're
going
to
remove
these
prices,
consumer
resale
prices.
you
better
get
at,
and
i
quote,
“the
big
fellows”
because
our
prices
obviously
are
necessarily
influenced
by
the
prices
that
we
have
to
pay,
the
wholesaler
has
to
pay.
and
so,
the
legislature,
during
the
regular
session,
did
nothing.
and
the
governor
called
a
special
session
and
by
this
time,
as
i
say,
they
had
learned
and
so
they
recommended
that
the
way
to
solve
the
problem
of
consumer
prices
was
not
only
by
the
elimination
of
the
price
fixing
agreement
--
sorry,
the
price
fixing
statute,
but
also
by
the
elimination
--
by
requiring
the
whole
--
distiller
and
wholesale
prices
to
be
lower
in
new
york.
now
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
there
is
evidence,
may
it
please
in
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
court,
there
was
evidence
that
the
price
that
the
retailer
paid
in
new
york.
the
retailer
was
higher
than
the
price
that
the
consumer
pays
right
here
in
washington.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
right.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
the
prices
to
the
retails
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
the
prices
to
the
retailers
by
the
wholesalers
were
known
to
be
higher.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
hold
--
against
new
york
wholesalers?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that,
i
cannot
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
not
willing
to
say
that
now.
i
want
to
go
back
and
look,
but
the
cons
--
retail
prices
were
high
because
--
for
one
reason,
because
the
retailer
was
paying
more
in
new
york
to
the
wholesaler.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
now
we
have
to
accept
the
--
that
they're
not
legislating
the
abstract
and
we
have
to
accept
what
is
known
in
the
industry
and
which
is
not
denied.
they
used
the
euphemism
“suggest”
but
the
distillers
suggest,
if
they
don't
direct,
wholesale
prices,
yes.
and
we
are
dealing
here
in
this
statute
not
with
every
little
wholesaler,
if
there
is
such
a
thing,
but
the
wholesalers
who
do
a
substantial
part
of
their
business
in
a
particular
brand.
liquor
is
not,
at
least
in
new
york
state,
wholesale
the
way
toothpaste
is
or
cereals
or
soap
flakes.
there
are
what
they
call
seagram
wholesalers
and
brown-forman
wholesalers
and
calvert
wholesalers.
and
those
wholesalers
are
not
permitted,
for
example
as
seagram
wholesaler,
is
not
permitted
to
distribute
the
same
grade
brand
of
liquor
from
another
wholesaler.
in
other
words,
a
prime
brand
of
seagram,
the
distiller
who
gets
--
sorry,
the
wholesaler
who
gets
the
distribution
of
that
brand
is
not
permitted
to
also
sell
a
prime
brand
of
say,
national
distillers.
and
this
is
a
--
the
price
schedules
of
which
mr.
daly
spoke
that
are
on
file,
also
have
on
file,
or
say,
the
price
schedule
for
four
roses
and
then
it
says
distributed
by
wholesalers
so
and
so
and
so
and
so
and
so
and
so.
so
that
there
is
that
influence
on
the
price.
as
i
say
--
they
you
--
they
say
suggested.
it
is
known
in
the
industry
that
it
is
a
little
more
than
suggested.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
when
i
say
i
--
i'm
not
willing
to
say
“yes,
there
was”
because
i
would
have
to
check
that.
but
may
i
say
this,
that
there
was
evidence
that
the
price
to
--
the
price
as
they
say,
seeps
down.
there
was
evidence
that
the
price
to
the
retailer
was
higher
than
it
was
elsewhere.
there
was
in
fairness
to
the
wholesaler
then,
certainly,
if
--
the
thing
to
do
was
to
have
ensured
that
the
distiller
didn't
charge
the
wholesaler
more.
in
other
words,
that
the
distiller
had
to
be
fair
to
the
wholesaler
if
you
were
going
to
require
the
wholesaler
who
is
tied
in
with
the
distiller
to
charge
less
to
the
retailer.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
may
i
please,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
in
any
legislation
the
legislation
has
to
spell
out,
we
have
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
found
buts
and
so,
we
have
to
assume
that
they
had
knowledge,
individual
knowledge,
pooled
knowledge,
and
the
case
having
said
so.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
the
legislature,
we
have
to
(inaudible)
--
we
have
to
assume
that
the
legislature
came
to
the
conclusion
from
things
people
told
them,
from
things
they
had
read,
from
things
they
had
heard
from
the
retailers
telling
them
and
there
is
at
least
one
bit
of
testimony
that
i
did
quote
in
the
brief.
one
of
the
retailers
who
said
to
the
joint
legislative
committee
this
isn't
where
the
problem
is.
the
problem
is
in
what
we
have
to
pay
and
this,
i
submit,
is
something
that
we
have
to
accept
that
a
legislative
body
is
not
required
to
prove.
we
did
this
because
we
had
this
on
record.
we
have
to
assume
that
they
had
it
on
record,
if
they
had
it
on
record,
certainly
it
is
reasonable.
on
any
--
i
mean,
as
i
say,
if
we
were
going
under
the
police
power.
there
was
a
mention
of
private
brands,
and
private
brands
are
not
covered
because
they
don't
have
to
be.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
go
cover
everything
in
the
law.
the
classification
is
--
there's
a
basis
for
classification.
for
example,
in
some
states,
you
can't
sell
liquor
for
on-premises
consumption.
that's
highly
--
hard
liquor
but
you
can't
sell
wine
or
beer.
so,
there's
a
reasonable
classification
of
that.
now,
i
should
say
one
thing
about
the
purpose
section
of
the
--
in
connection
with
section
9.
the
appellants
keep
quoting
one
provision,
but
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
quote
a
couple
of
more
lines
of
it.
section
8,
it's
in
page
20
of
my
brief,
the
legislature
found
the
consumers
of
alcoholic
beverage
in
this
state
should
not
be
discriminated
against
or
disadvantaged
by
play
--
paying
unjustifiably
higher
prices
for
brands
of
liquor
than
are
paid
by
consumers
in
other
states.
and
that
the
price
discrimination
and
favoritism
are
contrary
to
the
best
interest
and
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
state
that
section
11,
and
that's
the
one
they
removed
the
consumer
resale
price,
of
this
act
will
provide
a
basis
for
eliminating
such
discrimination
and
disadvantage
of
consumers
in
the
state
in
order
to
forestall
possible
monopolistic
and
anticompetitive
practices
designed
to
frustrate
the
elimination
of
such
discrimination
and
disadvantage.
that
is
to
say,
to
their
consumer.
it
is
hereby
further
declared
that
the
sale
of
liquor
should
be
subjected
to
certain
further
restrictions,
prohibitions,
and
regulations
and
the
necessity
for
the
enactment
of
the
provisions
of
section
9
of
this
act
is,
therefore,
declared
as
a
matter
of
legislative
discrimination.
it
has
been
suggested
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
brennan
that
there
are
here
abstract
questions
because
the
law
has
not
yet
been
put
in
effect.
i
hardly
agree.
they
are
here
on
conjecture
and
speculation
as
to
complications
they
are
going
to
run
into
and,
on
such
speculation
and
conjecture,
laws
are
not
declared
unconstitutional.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
do
i
--
yes,
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
yes.
and
indeed,
i
--
the
distiller
fixes
the
consumer
resale
price.
he
fixed
it
under
the
statutory
--
the
state
enforced
provision.
he
fixed
it
under
feld-crawford.
mr.
justice
black
asked
would
the
law
be
unconstitutional
if
pri
--
if
this
resulted
in
prices
raised
all
over
the
country.
certainly
not,
because
if
that
happens,
if
this
is
going
to
be
the
law
that
did
it,
it's
the
distiller
that
does
it
and
it
would
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
the
law.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
keep
your
prices
low.
you
manage
to
be
able
to
sell
for
lower
prices
elsewhere,
what
about
us?
now
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
justice
stewart,
no.
new
york
may
be
a
high-cost
market
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
only
one.
i
live
in
new
york
and
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
elsewhere.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
--
now,
there's
another
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
that
is,
in
new
york
as
well
as
in
any
large
state,
the
price
--
the
cost
of
operation
is
cheaper
in
one
part
of
the
state
than
the
other,
rents
are
cheaper
and
some
aren't.
that
has
not
had
anything
to
do
with
the
price
of
liquor
in
new
york
state,
either
the
dis
--
well,
the
distillers,
of
course,
have
to
sell
to
all
their
wholesalers
at
the
same
--
any
distiller
has
to
sell
under
new
york's
wholesaler.
but
the
wholesalers,
the
wholesaler
who
i
would
suspect
pays
less
rent
in
albany
than
he
does
in
new
york
or
white
plains,
he
charges
exactly
the
same
to
--
as
the
wholesalers
in
new
york
city
or
the
wholesaler
in
rochester
or
buffalo.
so,
that
has
had
no
influence
on
the
price
of
liquor.
now
--
and
another
thing,
when
they
say
that
if
they
have
to
lower
--
that
the
--
they
can't
lower
the
price
in
new
york
state
without
raising
it
elsewhere.
how
come
that
in
one-third
of
the
states
of
these
united
states,
they
are
required
to
warrant
that
their
price
is
no
lower
than
in
other
state?
that
hasn't,
apparently
influence
the
price
in
new
york
state
or
in
a
lot
of
other
states.so,
they
don't
have
to
have
a
uniform
price.
new
york
doesn't
say
it
has
to
match.
it
can
be
lower
in
new
york.
it
could
be
higher
elsewhere.
and,
new
york
has
never
said
that,
although
you
can
have
a
distiller
fix
consumer
price
that
has
to
be
high,
but
it's
been
high
and
there
are
in
--
there
have
been,
for
example,
letters
put
into
records
that
indicate
that
when
the
con
--
the
wholesaler
sells
to
the
consumer
or
to
the
--
sorry,
the
distiller
sells
to
the
wholesaler,
he
says,
“we
charge
you
this
and
so,
thou
shall
charge
this
and
so
to
the
wholesaler,
wholesaler
to
the
retailer,
and
then
the
consumer
fixed.”
so,
there
is
this
influence
and
it
is
only
those
wholesalers
who
are
controlled
because
the
(inaudible)
--
the
people
who
drew
the
law
had
learned
that
if
they
just
said
to
the
distillers,
“you
charge
this,”
the
wholesaler
wasn't
going
to
do
a
particle
of
good
because
these
--
the
distillers
--
the
wholesalers
who
are
the
arm
of
the
distillers
would
be
keeping
the
price
up,
and
this
is
why
they
did
it.
and
the
fact
that
the
distillers
would
be
innocent
of
who
is
substantial
and
so
on,
there
are
affidavits
in
the
record
put
in
by
the
plaintiffs
as
to
the
number
of
wholesalers
they
have.
they
don't
have
that
many
wholesalers.
even
a
house
like
seagram
has
330
in
all
of
the
united
states
and
they
can
tell
you
instantly
how
many
they
have
in
new
york,
and
they
know
how
much,
and
it's
in
the
record
and
i
have
quoted
what
they
put
down
on
the
brief,
how
much
each
wholesaler
does?
what
percentage
of
each
wholesaler's
business
is
done
in
seagram
from
the
one
who
does
90%
to
the
one
who
does
1%
or
to
5%
so
that
there
is
an
--
this
is
an
--
a
hierarchy
and
a
very
tight-knit
operation
and
we
must
appreciate
that
this
legislation
was
enacted
not
in
the
abstract
but
geared
to
the
particular
industry.
and
on
the
other
hand,
no
laws
have
to
be
geared
to
the
practices
of
an
industry
to
what
might
upset
the
practices
of
an
industry.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
certainly
suspect
so.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
that
there
is
some
testimony
to
that
effect.
when
i
say
testimony
--
sorry,
the
affidavit
and
i
--
it's
the
--
i
have
said
something
in
the
affidavit
--
in
the
brief
about
the
operation
as
they
disclaimed
from
these
affidavits.
they
divide
the
country
into
regions
and
they
have
people
over
in
charge
of
each
region,
and
it
is
--
there
was
reporting
up
the
line,
and
they
have
what
they
call
--
is
known
colloquially
in
the
industry
as
missionaries
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
who
go
around
the
country
watching
their
prices.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
it
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
he
doesn't
have
to
know
the
retail
price

ms.
ruth

for
this
statute.
his
own
price
he
knows.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no
question.
the
price
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
of
his
--
sorry?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
alright.
the
wholesalers,
alright.
the
wholesaler's
price,
yes,
because
if
liquor
is
manufactured
for
the
purpose
of
falling
into
a
certain
category,
there
are
prime
brands,
a
brands,
and
so
on.
and,
there's
a
price
for
each
one
of
these
brands
and,
before
a
brand
leaves
a
distillery,
they
know
down
the
line
what
it's
going
to
sell
for
and
it
mustn't
drop
out
of
that
price
range
because
if
it
does,
it
drops
out
of
their
rate
and
the
competition
between
--
in
the
liquor
industry
is
not
a
price
competition.
in
other
words,
i'm
not
going
to
sell
it
cheaper
a
brand
and
this
is
how
i'm
going
to
get
the
business.
it's
a
prestige
of
a
brand.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
the
--
i
think
the
way
it
is,
is
the
wholesaler
is
not
--
in
other
words,
there're
just
certain
wholesalers
who
are
bound
by
this,
and
that
is
the
ones
who
have
an
exclusive
franchise
or
an
interlocking
director
or
are
ahead,
do
a
substantial
part
of
their
business.
and
the
affirmation,
they
don't
have
to
find
out
the
prices.
the
distiller
is
the
one
who
makes
the
affirmation
and
the
distiller,
in
this
industry,
the
manufacturer
is
in
a
position
to
make
that
affirmation
because,
as
i
say,
it
isn't
like
toothpaste
that
every
wholesaler
in
the
united
states
--
drug
wholesalers
sells
it
or
cereal
that
every
grocery
jobber
or
whatever
you
call
it,
sells
it.
there
are
limited
numbers,
there
are
limited
number
and
i
have
noted
that
in
the
brief,
the
largest
number
of
wholesalers
for
any
one
of
these
brand
is
the
seagram
and
they
have
330
and
they
go
down
the
line.
so,
the
--
i
would
dare
say
that
at
the
drop
of
a
hat,
any
--
the
executive,
the
chief
executives,
the
people
who've
made
the
affidavits
in
this
case
couldn't
tell
you
what
their
brand
is
selling
for.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
maybe
they
have
the
maverick.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
sorry.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
the
wholesaler
may
not
but
practically,
he
certainly
does.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
--
and,
number
one,
they
--
for
any
criminal
prosecution,
there
obviously
has
to
be
a
criminal
intent.
and
in
any
--
the
administration
of
any
statute,
the
--
obviously,
prosecution
isn't
demands
it,
but
if
the
--
in
the
administration
of
any
statute,
if
any
distiller
is
going
to
say,
“i
don't
want
to
do
it,”
but
it
happens
every
day,
if
any
distiller
goes
to
the
liquor
authority
and
says,
“we're
great,
except
this
particular
wholes
--
we're
in
shape.
this
is
our
lowest
price,
except
that
we
have
a
maverick
wholesaler
out
somewhere.
he
won't
tell
it.”
then
i
assure
your
honor,
as
a
very
practical
matter,
he
is
not
going
to
be
prosecuted,
certainly
not.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
it
--
that
is
only
the
wholesaler
who
has
--
does
a
substantial
part
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
he
--
as
a
practical
matter,
he
knows
it
in
advance
and
in
--
and
it's
in
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that's
it.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
the
related
person
is
the
wholesaler.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
related
person
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
right.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
only
in
those
cir
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
what
i
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
who
fits
that
definition
and
the
reason
they
put
that
in
is
because
they
knew
they
might
as
well
not
write
the
law
if
they
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
did
not
do
it
that
way.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
because
the
distiller
--
justice
said
here,
he's
--
have
quoted
it
and
said,
“go
peddle
your
papers,”
and
the
wholesaler
would've
been.
it's
only
those
who
are
the
arms
and
any
wholesaler
who
has
that
relationship
and
doesn't
tell
the
price,
if
the
--
indeed
the
distiller
doesn't
know
it
in
advance
which
as
a
practical
matter,
he
does.
if
he
doesn't
tell
it,
he
is
going
to
be
out
of
business
and
if
he
does
a
substantial
amount
of
the
business
in
any
one
of
these
brands,
he
is
jolly
well
going
to
tell
him
right
away
quick
if
they
don't
know
it
beforehand
because
this
is
where
they
get
their
business.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
justice
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
justice
white,
they
do
it
now.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
no.
i
--
they're
not
going
to
do
that.
all
they're
going
to
do
now
that's
different
from
anything
else
they
do
is
to
affirm
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
they
have
in
advance,
should
they
have
at
the
end
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
of
the
month
that
they'll
make
the
affirmation.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that
is
only
if
they're
going
to
insist
on
keeping
their
prices
up
in
new
york.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
that's
their
doing.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that
is
their
doing.
if
they
say,
“now,
in
order
for
me
to
keep
my
prices
up
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
in
new
york
state
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that's
their
tough
luck
and
they're
doing
it
(inaudible)
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
this
law,
to
defeat
it,
because
what
new
york
wants
is
not
for
them
to
raise
the
prices
outside
so
as
to
keep
the
prices
up
in
new
york.
new
york
likes
the
prices
outside
of
their
state
fine
and
says,
“so,
we
want
to
get
in
on
it.”
i
believe
it's
mr.
justice
black
who
noted
that
the
legislature
could,
each
year,
fix
that
price,
fix
the
price
according
to
the
lowest
price
in
other
states
and
indeed
they
could.
they
could
give
the
maximum
percentage
markup
and
so
on.
and
this
actually
leaves
them
free
to
determine
their
own
prices,
but
not
to
charge
more
in
new
york
than
they
find
it
possible
to
charge
elsewhere.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
of
course
not.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
why
wouldn't
it?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that
the
robinson-patman
act
has
anything
to
do
with
this
or
the
sherman
act.
they
can
charge
more
outside
new
york
state.
they
can
charge
less
in
new
york,
but
the
new
york's
--
they
--
we
just
don't
want
to
charge
more
in
new
york,
which
they've
been
doing,
any
more
than
they've
been
charging
less
in
new
york
because
they
charge
more
else
--
because
they
charge
less
elsewhere.
they
have
been
doing
it
now.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
i
don't
because
--
i
say,
i
think
that
what's
happened
in
the
17
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
monopoly
states
--
sorry
mr.
justice.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
i
am
not
in
on
the
conclaves
of
the
industry
so
i
don't
know
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
if
they're
going
to
operate
that
way.
i
don't
know.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
--
has
anything
to
do
with
the
law.
we're
not
supposed
to
be
determining
their
merchandising
practices
nor
are
we
supposed
to
be
gearing
our
statute
to
it
and
this
is
i
say
is
under
the
police
power.
i
am
not
talking
about
--
i
would
rest
with
the
twenty-first
amendment,
but
if
i
were
going
to
go
into
the
police
power,
this
is
under
the
police
power.
most
of
our
discussion
has
been
as
though
this
were
--
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
not
determinative
which
i
am
willing
to
say
it
is.
now,
the
--
under
the
police
power,
the
--
this
court
has
found
for
example
that
you
can
set
the
price
of
their
tickets,
tobacco
and
so
on.
so,
certainly
to
--
it
is
within
the
policy
of
those
cases
and
length
and
conscience
in
respect
to
consumer
protection
that
new
york
had
--
was
within
its
power
under
the
police
power
to
set
this.
now,
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
i
submit
that
all
the
earlier
cases
have
frankly
discriminate
--
had
held
laws
that
rationally
discriminate
it
against
out
of
state
vendors
of
liquor
and
this
court
has
upheld
them
and
i
submit
that
there's
nothing
in
the
later
cases
that
suggest
that
any
limitation
of
the
principle
on
which
those
cases
were
decided,
and
which
is
the
principle
of
this
statute
as
an
internal
regulation
of
the
sale
of
liquor
within
the
geographical
limits
of
this
state
--
of
new
york.
i
think
we've
gone
adequately,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
on
the
police
power
and
also
on
the
status
of
the
wholesalers
in
this
state.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
sir?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
would
suspect
it
was
the
retailers.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
it
was
the
combination
of
two
things.
that
the
retailers
felt
that
it
wasn't
fair
to
them
to
remove
section
101
and
then
leave
them
paying
the
higher
prices
to
the
wholesalers
and
the
wholesalers
to
distiller.
and
the
next
thing
was
that
they
--
inevitably
they
were
going
to
be
the
feld-crawford
agreement
and
inevitably,
the
feld-crawford
--
the
price
under
feld-crawford
was
going
to
be
high
unless
the
retailers
were
paying
less.so
they
showed
that
the
--
if
it
was
the
retailers
who
talked
about
it,
they
showed,
“why
did
we
move
and
let
101
say
not
only
was
unfair
to
them,”
if
that
was
all
that
was
done
but
also
that
it
wouldn't
do
to
consumers
a
bit
of
good
and
they
proved
to
be
correct
because
not
only
these
feld-crawford
agreements
were
entered
into
with
great
speed
and
alacrity
and
enforced
and
the
consumer
price
has
not
only
remained
high
but
in
some
instances,
has
gone
up.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
believe
that
a
retailer
has
only
retail
license.
is
that
what
you
mean?
and
only
for
one
location.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
to
my
knowledge,
no.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
to
my
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
believe
it
is
and
i
believe
that
the
license
in
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
to
location.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
they
have
just
one.
i
believe
--
now,
if
they
sell
liquor,
and
i
--
i'm
--
i
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
would
be
willing
to
vouch
for
it.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
it's
another
corporation
that
sells
that
if
they
do
have
others,
i
think
so.
but
i'm
not
willing
to
assert
that
as
an
actual
fact.
i
wouldn't
know,
but
they
--
there
are
no
such
things
as
a
lot
of
chain
selling
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
liquor
as
there
are
where
drug
stores,
i
guess,
and
groceries
can
sell
them
we
think
in
new
york.
they
sell
liquor
and
--
except
that
as
they
say,
apparently,
the
palmer
store
can
have
a
liquor
license
for
one
--
for
the
sale
of
liquor
even
though
it
sells
other
things
and
how
that
comes
about,
i
wouldn't
be
willing
to
vouch.
but
they
--
in
any
event,
they
sell
only
at
retail
and
there
can
be
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
they
have
a
right
to
do
business
and
they
have
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
to
be
licensed
to
do
business
in
new
york--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
or
through
an
agent,
but
this
law
affects
only
those
who
do
business
outside
the
state.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
12%.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
12%,
this
--
i
don't
--
i'm
no
expert
on
economics,
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
where
you
do
a
lot
more
business,
you
would
be
selling
for
less.
i
mean
that's
the
theory
on
which
woolworths
and
other
stores
have
been
able
to
keep
prices
down
at
least
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
(inaudible)
--
well,
they
do
say
that
their
price
cost
of
operation
is
higher
in
new
york
and
i'm
sure
that
it
is
higher
in
california
and
higher
in
a
lot
of
other
states
than,
say,
it
is
in
nebraska,
but
at
the
--
that
is
what
happens
when
you
have
a
nationwide
operation.
but
again
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
as
i
have
said
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
their
price
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
because,
i
believe
that
it
was
found
that,
as
far
as
the
cost
of
--
as
far
as
liquor
prices
are
concerned,
they
are
not
so
much
tied
in
with
the
price
--
cost
of
operation
as
they
are
with
keeping
a
level
--
with
the
prices
for
a
brand.
now,
i
have
never
lived
in
washington.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
but
i
wouldn't
suspect
that
washington
is
a
very
low
--
has
a
very
living
cost.
and
the
price
of
operation,
i
suspect
that
rents
are
higher
in
washington,
i
don't
know.
and
yet,
they
do
some
for
less
in
washington,
they
--
i
don't
think
it
was
found
that
there
was
a
relationship
necessarily
between
the
lower
price
and
the
state
in
which
it
was
sold
any
more
than
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
sale
in
parts
of
--
sections
of
new
york
state
or
other
state.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
oh,
i
think
they
will
but,
beyond
that,
i
don't
think
that
is
--
i
respectfully
submit
the
concern
of
the
court.
i
mean,
that's
within
the
competence
of
the
legislature.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
but
the
new
york
law
doesn't
help
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
it
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
it
hasn't
yet,
has
it?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
it
hasn't
yet.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to
determine
--
i'm
sorry?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that's
right.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that
is
correct
and
i
don't
think
that
we
have
a
right
to
assume
or
even
to
accord
them
the
right
to
find
a
way
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
this
law
by
raising
the
price
elsewhere
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
which
is
exactly
what
they're
going
to
do.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
i
--
yes
i
do.
those
arguments,
i
certainly
do,
yes.
i
think
that
it's
all
based
--
all
their
arguments
are
in
conjecture
and
speculation
and
their
--
let's
say,
fair
argument
that
we
have
a
right
to
charge
--
that
we
have
a
right
to
charge
and
new
york
can
tell
us.
and
i
think
that
especially
when
it
comes
--
when
we're
dealing
with
liquor
which
is
a
regulated
industry
and
where
there
has
obviously
been,
very
obviously,
we
know
we
have
to
look
at
the
charts
and
i've
summarized
some
of
them
here
where
they're
obviously
keeping
a
price
left
that
new
york
can
say
to
this
regulated
industry,
“we
are
not
only
not
going
to
protect
you
and
accord
you
this
right
but
we
think
that
we
have
found
that
you
are
charging
less
elsewhere,
you
apparently
can
charge
less
elsewhere,
they,
too,
should
charge
us
a
little
less.”
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
oh,
assured
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
assuredly.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
right.
and
i
personally
have
a
profound
regard
for
the
merchandising
guilt,
the
business
guilt
of
this
industry
and
i'm
sure
they're
going
to
--
i
don't
think
they're
going
to
go
out
of
business.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
they're
going
to
go
out
of
business.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i'm
sorry,
justice
stewart?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
may
i
be
permitted
a
witticism?
i
thought
that
this
case
is
either
going
to
make
me
an
alcoholic
or
i'll
never
touch
a
drop.
i
--
as
far
as
they
do
raise
interstate
commerce
and
sherman
act
and
robinson-patman
act
arguments
and
as
i
say,
i
think
that
this
case
--
we
rest
on
the
twenty-first
amendment
bolstered
by
the
police
power
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
this
court
to
be
applicable
to
prices,
maximum
prices,
but
--
and
i
have
talked
about
the
--
their
arguments
on
the
interstate
commerce
and
sherman
act
somewhat.
it's
a
repercussion
argument
and
they
reach
for
it.
and
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
i
turn
to
the
frankfort
distilleries
case
and
the
frankfort
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
yes,
it
is
a
twenty-first
amendment.
i
don't
think
we
can
get
away
with
it
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
i
wouldn't
be
willing
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
if
the
act
would
have
to
direct
the
conspiracy,
i
would
like
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
to
be
excused
for
saying
so.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
--
i'm
now
willing
to
say
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
what
is
it,
justice?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
the
twenty-first
amendment,
yes.
and
i
don't
think
that's
--
that
the
act
directs
it.
well,
let
me
say
this.
i
think
there
are
provisions
in
our
abc
law,
alcoholic
beverage
control
law,
and
probably
a
lot
more
over
the
country
that
certainly
direct
a
lot
of
things
that
would
be
perhaps
violative
of
the
sherman
act.
they
direct,
for
example,
that
every
wholesaler
must
charge
the
same
to
every
one
of
his
retailers.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
to
say
that
the
other
wholesaler
for
the
same
product
should.
that's
a
different
thing.
this
they've
done
but
they're
not
certainly
required
to.
now,
i
don't
know,
is
that
a
price
fixing?
but,
they
are
required
to.
new
york
state
statute
does
not
permit
them
to
give
inducements
and
they're
concerned
about
the
word
“inducements,”
but
this
has
been
the
law
for
22
years.
a
wholesaler
to
a
retailer
--
to
his
retailers
or
distillers
to
wholesalers,
not
supposed
to
pay
for
their
advertising
and
things
like
that,
not
suppose
to
give
them
anything
but
the
2%
quantity
discount.
now,
other
state
laws
permit
it.
now,
if
you're
going
to
make
a
robinson-patman
argument,
and
then
this
law
violates
it.
so,
i
think
we
really
need
to
go
back
and
we
can
stay
with
it,
that
this
is
a
twenty-first
amendment,
that
anything
that
they
might
be
doing
otherwise
would
be
of
their
doing.
it
isn't
the
law.
it
is
of
the
industry's
doing
and
with
this,
we
surely
are
not
concerned,
we're
not
directing
it.
and
even
if
we
were
directing
it
as
being
the
twenty-first
amendment,
i
think
that
it
wouldn't
be
--
this
wouldn't
make
the
law
invalid.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
--
you
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
that's
a
--
it
doesn't
do
it.
i
don't
think
it
does
it,
no
matter
what
the
commodity
is.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
it
would
have
to
be.
in
other
words,
under
--
i
believe
that
one
of
the
opinions
in
frankfort
distilleries
said
that
--
the
--
if
they're
doing
anything
that
might
conceivably
be
violative
of
the
sherman
act
then
their
ordinary
--
other
circumstances,
if
it
was
their
doing,
it
would
not
be
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
because
the
statute
--
they
will
be
doing
something
to
comply
with
the
public
statute.
it
would
not
be
unreasonable.
you
have
to
get
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
but
isn't
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
now
--
well,
it
doesn't
compel
them.
i
can't
say
that
it
compels
them.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
you
want
me
to
say
whether
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
it
compels
them
and
yes
i'm
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
what
i
--
i've
been
trying
to
say
all
along.
i
was
trying
to
answer
a
question
and
that
is
why
i
said
that,
but
i
have
insisted
all
along
that
this
doesn't
compel
them
to
do
anything
--
any
conspiring
to
fix
prices.
what
section
8
and
this
is
--
they
kept
calling
it
an
antitrust
and
an
anti
(inaudible)
--
no,
competitive
and
still
unlocked.
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind
in
writing
that
was,
as
i
say,
they
had
become
educated
and
it
didn't
take
clairvoyance
for
them
to
see
that
there
would
be
a
tacit
maintaining
of
distiller
and
wholesale
prices
in
order
that
the
removal
of
section
101
(c)
was
not
going
to
mean
the
consumer
resale
price
of
their
brands.
and
each
one
has
his
priced
brand
that
they
certainly
don't
want
to
come
down
to
low
prices,
and
this
was
the
reason
for
this
law.
and
when
they
say
in
their
brief,
“well,
if
we're
doing
this,
you
can
get
us
under
this
statute
or
that
statute
or
the
other
statute.”
well,
it's
up
to
the
legislature
to
say
whether
we
think
this
statute
is
good
enough
and
the
court
well
knows
there
are
any
number
of
statutes
that
affect
the
individuals
and
industries
conduct
the
same
conduct.
i
submit
that
this
statute
is
entirely
constitutional
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
even
if
we
search
for
reasonableness
under
the
police
power
that
it
certainly
does
not
compel
the
violation
of
any
provision
of
the
constitution
or
any
statute
and
so
there's
no
federal
statute,
there
is
no
issue
of
supremacy.
