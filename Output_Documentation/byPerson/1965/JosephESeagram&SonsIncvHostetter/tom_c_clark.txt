you
can
fair
trade
it,
couldn't
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
despite
this
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
even
though
--
even
though
we
decided
that
this
law
was
alright,
they
could
still
fair
trade
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
thought
it
could
be.
did
the
court
of
appeals
passed
that
--
wasn't
that
in
their
opinion
last
week?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
it
could
be
higher?
justice
tom
c.
clark
your
position
is
that
if
this
section
is
--
it
sounds
defective
it
could
not
fair
trade
it
at
a
higher
price
in
new
york.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
as
i
understood
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
why
--
say,
they
set
the
price
at
$10,
and
they'd
been
selling
outside
the
state
at
$9
and
that
$10
price
was
set
under
the
--
under
a
contract,
under
the
fair
trade,
would
that
be
possible
assuming
that
this
section
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
so,
they
could
sell
at
a
higher
price.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
sorry.
i
still
don't
understand.
suppose
you
would
--
(inaudible)
we're
talking
now
about
the
distiller,
he
elected
--
say
you
lost
this
case
and
he
elected,
“well,
i'll
sell
directly
to
retailers
under
the
crawford-feld
or
feld-crawford
act”
and
so
he
makes
a
contract
at
$10,
let's
say.
all
then
--
this
time
(inaudible)
might
he
sell
them
in
new
jersey
for
$9?
now,
would
that
be
legal?
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
couldn't
do
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
if
he
sells
directly
(inaudible)
--
sells
directly,
he's
covered
by
the
act?
