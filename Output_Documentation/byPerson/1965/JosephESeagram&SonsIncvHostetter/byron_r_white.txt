justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
daly.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
prediction
on
what
will
happen
if
this
law
is
upheld?
will
it
result
in
a
--
in
one
price
across
the
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
it
almost
have
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
legis
--
even
though
the
commission
(inaudible)
--
if
the
commission
was
empowered
to
investigate
the
prices
at
which
liquor
was
sold
around
the
country
and
was
directed
to
set
the
price
for
the
forthcoming
month
at
the
lowest
price
it
found
around
the
country
that
--
would
you
say
that
was
alright
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
be
valid,
do
you
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
rest
on
any
--
on
the
supremacy
clause
or
conflicts
(inaudible)
of
that
by
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
(inaudible)
--
from
the
standpoint
of
the
wholesalers,
you
don't
rest
on
this
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
are
--
these
all
--
these
local
wholesalers?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
goodman,
i
gather,
the
moreland
commission
didn't
recommend
this
law.
where
did
it
come
from?
what
interest
did
come
up
with
this
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
--
usually,
laws
like
these
have
some
interest
in
mind
or
some
purposes
to
be
affected.
i'm
just
trying
to
fathom
whose
interests
are
served
at
all
by
this
bill,
by
this
law?
do
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
lose
by
it
but
who
gains?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
can
he
fix
the
price
--
the
price
at
which
it's
sold?
it
just
doesn't
--
fixing
a
minimum
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
just
one
price?
they
can't
go
higher
or
lower,
if
he
fair
trades
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
said
--
so,
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
this
is
the
consumer
interest
which
was
promoting
this
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
must
say
then,
what
was
then
--
what
does
appear
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
what
prompted
this
bill?
is
it
just
a
very
large
mystery
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
--
can
they
--
who
introduced
it,
but
i
have
no
idea
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
intend
to
--
feld-crawford
however
would
permit
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
non-signing
provision
in
the
feld-crawford
--
justice
byron
r.
white
feld-crawford
--
the
feld-crawford
relates
only
to
retail
prices
to
consumers,
is
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
there's
no
inherent
--
inconsistency
between
these
two
acts
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
sanctions
in
this
law?
is
it
cancellation
of
licenses
or
is
it
a
criminal
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
you
lost
the
--
you've
lost
this
case
to
the
extent
--
i'm
just
saying
that
we
can't
decide
it
here,
isn't
right
or
something
like
that?
how
could
you
ever
get
it
up
here
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
the
court
disagreed
with
you
on
your
due
process
argument
and
we
really
wanted
to
look
into
the
conflict
--
problems
of
conflict
of
robinson-patman
and
sherman
act?
there,
you
--
let's
see,
you
have
to
have
a
more
concrete
--
a
little
more
concrete
details
and
a
better
picture
of
the
context
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
from
the
impact
under
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
said
--
passed
a
law
that
said
all
the
distillers
must
get
together
and
all
agree
upon
the
price
and
sell
only
at
the
agreed
upon
price?
do
you
think
that
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
withstanding
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
wholesaler
--
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
the
wholesaler
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
doesn't
need
to
give
this
information
to
the
distiller
legally.
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
mr.
justice
fortas
is
asking
about
the
criminal
penalty
side.
if
the
wholesaler
says,
“go
peddle
your
papers,
i
won't
give
you
this
kind
of
information,”
and
the
distiller
can't
get
it
and,
yet,
this
particular
wholesaler
actually
has
shown
to
have
sold
in
a
lower
price
than
the
distiller
posed,
what
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
it
the
--
why
isn't
it
the
--
why
isn't
the
other
side
correct
in
saying
that
just
this
--
this
absolutely
forces
the
distiller
to
enter
into
an
arrangement
with
all
related
persons
as
to
what
prices
the
wholesalers
can
resell
their
products
because
otherwise,
there's
a
--
the
scheme
just
couldn't
work.
i
mean,
the
wholesaler
--
the
distillers
aren't
going
to
put
up
with
just
a
lot
of
hear
them-scare
them
pricing
around
the
country.
they're
going
to
say
their
wholesalers
know
this
is
a
--
this
--
we
got
to
price
up
so
we
could
keep
our
--
so
we
won't
go
out
of
business,
so
let's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
all
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
what
you
say
they're
going
to
do.
you
agree
they're
going
to
do
that.
now,
why
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
suggest
they're
just
not
going
to
sit
back
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
wait
for
information.
they're
going
to
make
an
arrangement
which
the
law
most
requires
them
to
do
with
the
wholesalers
as
to
what
their
prices
are
going
to
be.
and
so,
you're
going
to
have
a
manufacturer,
a
distiller,
ring
--
entering
into
an
arrangement
on
resale
prices
with
wholesalers.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
get
it.
that's
fine,
but
that
--
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
going
to
have
to
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
that
if
the
necessary
result
of
your
law
is
for
them
to
enter
into
an
arrangement
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
that's
their
tough
luck.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
another
one.
let's
--
doesn't
this
law
say
that
--
let's
say
that
a
--
it
makes
a
distiller
sell
at
a
certain
price
level
in
new
york
and
if
that
distiller
wants
to
sell
in
another
state
at
a
higher
price,
it
doesn't
prevent
him
from
doing
that
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that,
i
suppose,
as
regarding
a
competing
distiller
would
be
a
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
primary
lined
competition
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
--
do
you
think
economically
that
the
result
is
going
to
be
a
leveled
price
across
the
country
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
suggesting
there's
anything
wrong
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
suggesting
there's
anything
wrong
with
that.
i'm
just
wondering
what
your
prediction
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
thought
on
the
core
of
what
the
legislative
history
shows
on
what
interests
were
promoting
this
law
or
you
--
i
know
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
--
you
say
it
was
aimed
at
certainly
protecting
consumers.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
gives
--
if
the
retailers
were
really
interested
in
this
to
--
in
order
to
get
branded
products
cheaper?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
state,
are
retail
licenses
restricted
in
the
sense
of
one
license
to
one
person
or
may
a
person
have
several
outlets?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
and
the
corp
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
partnership
or
a
corporation
can't
have
the
whole
string,
the
whole
chain
of
retail
liquor
establishments.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
an
individual
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
macy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
macy's?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
sell
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
macy
sell
liquor
--
if
they
sell
liquor
at
all,
they
just
sell
at
that
one
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
liquors.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
most
of
the
distillers
that
are
affected
out
of
--
they
actually
do
their
distilling
operations
outside
of
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
are
foreign
corporations
as
far
as
new
york
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes,
i
know
they're
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
new
york
is
what
percentage
in
the
national
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
12%.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
record
support
your
claim
that
new
york
was
the
higher
priced
market
in
--
higher
cost
market
in
terms
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
what
happened,
but
if
you
concede
that
cost
could
easily
be
lower
in
nebraska
than
in
new
york,
what's
very
reasonable
about
new
york
saying
that
people
doing
business
in
new
york
must
sell
at
the
same
price
as
they
sell
in
nebraska?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
going
to
have
to
get
their
cost
back
somewhere
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
law
hasn't
done
anything
yet
because
the
wholesaler
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
has
never
been
enforced
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
just
ask
you
a
hypothetical
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
question.
so
let's
just
assume,
just
assume
now,
the
only
way
that
you
could
comply
with
the
new
york
law
was
to
violate
the
sherman
act.
well,
let's
just
assume
that.
now,
what
about
that
on
their
constitutional
argument
--
on
their
supremacy
clause
argument?
would
you
say
that
the
state
may
force
people
to
violate
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
twenty-first
amendment
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
aside
--
aside
from
the
twenty-first
amendment,
you
wouldn't
think
new
york
could
get
away
with
that
under
the
sherman
act?
if
new
york
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
it
wasn't
liquor
here
that
it
was
some
other
commodity
that
this
applies
to
and
the
only
way
you
could
possibly
comply
with
it
was
to
violate
the
sherman
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
rely
on
the
twenty-first
amendment
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
twenty-first
amendment
catches
the
(inaudible)?
