mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
here
on
direct
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
from
a
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
in
this
case,
the
united
had
sued
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
to
set
aside
the
acquisition
by
the
pabst
brewing
company
of
the
assets
and
business
of
the
blatz
brewing
company.
after
the
government
had
put
its
evidence
into
the
record
and
before
the
defendant
submitted
any
evidence
or
attempted
a
rebuttal,
the
district
court
granted
defendant's
motion
for
dismissal
upon
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
had
shown
no
right
to
relief
upon
the
facts
and
upon
the
law.
the
united
states
had
alleged
that
the
merger
of
these
two
substantial
competing
beer
companies
violated
section
7
because
of
probable
anticompetitive
effects
in
three
markets,
the
sale
of
beer
in
wisconsin;
the
sale
of
beer
in
the
three-state
region
consisting
of
wisconsin,
illinois
and
michigan;
and
the
sale
of
beer
in
the
united
states
as
a
whole.
the
district
court
held
that
the
evidence
submitted
by
the
united
states
had
not
established
that
either
wisconsin
or
the
three-state
region
constituted
valid
geographic
markets.
the
court,
therefore,
confined
its
consideration
of
probable
anticompetitive
effects
to
the
national
market.
but
in
making
that
evaluation,
it
refused
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
merger
occurred
in
an
industry
that
was
experiencing
a
pronounced
trend
toward
concentration.
it
refused
to
consider
this
fact
because
a
showing
had
not
been
made
that
that
concentration
trend
had
resulted
from
mergers.
the
district
court
therefore
concluded
that
by
itself,
evidence
of
the
combined
share
of
the
national
market
held
by
pabst
and
blatz
did
not
suffice
to
make
the
acquisition
unlawful
and
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
with
prejudice.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
used
an
erroneous
standard
for
the
determination
of
a
geographic
market.
under
a
proper
standard,
we
believe
that
the
government's
unrebutted
evidence
compelled
the
conclusion
that
valid
regional
markets
existed
in
wisconsin
and
in
the
three-state
region.
where
you
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
we
also
believe
that
the
united
states
is
a
relevant
market
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
we
believe
that
wisconsin
and
the
three-state
areas
are
also
relevant
markets
and
perhaps
more
accurately
reflect
the
impact
of
this
merger.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
dismissal
is
inaccurate
in
that
case
too,
mr.
justice,
because
the
judge
refused
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
merger
took
place
in
the
context
of
a
dramatically
accelerating
trend
toward
concentration.
and
therefore,
we
believe,
that
had
he
taken
that
fact
into
consideration
as
we
believe
he
is
required
to,
the
merger
would
be
unlawful
even
though
measured
on
a
national
basis.
we
believe
that
where
these
errors
corrected,
the
errors
of
market
definition
and
the
errors
of
consideration
of
concentration
trends,
that
the
unrebutted
case
submitted
by
the
government,
establishes
a
violation
of
section
7.
accordingly,
we
propose
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
that
court
to
hear
the
defendant's
evidence
to
determine
whether
the
government's
showing
has
been
rebutted.
i
should
like
first
to
turn
to
the
question
of
geographic
market
definition
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
is
one
finding
which
we
submit
is
clearly
erroneous
but
we
believe
in
a
major
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
we
believe
the
--
with
respect
to
one
finding,
we
believe
the
major
difficulty
however
is
a
question
of
law
and
that
is
the
proper
standard
by
which
to
determine
geographic
market
which
we
believe
to
be
a
legal
question.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
dismissal
was
under
rule
41
(b).
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
and
the
stated
that
there's
no
question
--
there's
no
case
made
in
fact
or
in
law.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
we
should
approach
this
on
the
basis
of
whether
an
error
of
law
had
been
committed
below.
i
think
there
is
one
finding
that
is
clearly
erroneous
but
our
basic
argument
is
that
it
is
an
error
of
law
below
in
the
definition
of
geographic
market.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
that
there
are
no
locational
advantages
which
affect
the
beer
industry.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
believe
it's
finding
30
on
page
467
of
the
record.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
should
like
to
divide
my
argument
into
three
parts.
i
would
first
want
to
review
the
question
of
what
the
appropriate
standard
for
discerning
a
geographic
market
is,
and
i
wish
to
attempt
to
show
why
the
government's
unrebutted
evidence
suffice
to
prove
that
regional
markets
existed.
secondly,
i
would
wish
to
examine
the
standards
applied
by
the
district
court
and
indicate
the
error
of
that
court.
finally,
i
would
wish
to
indicate
why
under
proper
market
definitions
and
given
a
proper
consideration
to
concentration
trends,
we
believe
that
the
acquisition
has
been
shown
to
be
unlawful,
unlawful
at
least,
until
such
time
as
the
defendants
on
remand
can
refute
the
government's
contentions.
turning
to
the
question
of
geographic
market
definition,
this
problem
has
been
before
the
court.
you
had
it
before
the
court
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
a
section
7
suit
and
it's
also
been
before
the
court
in
other
context
such
as
the
tampa
electric
case
and
the
standard
oil
case,
clayton
act
cases
under
section
3.
i
doubt,
however,
that
the
issue
has
been
presented
as
cleanly
as
it
is
here
between
the
defendant's
contention
with
which
the
district
court
agrees
that
the
sale
of
beer
is
a
national
market
and
the
government's
contention
that
it
has
established
that
regional
markets
exist.
for
purposes
of
analysis,
i
propose
to
deal
principally
with
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
deal
with
the
facts
in
the
record
on
that
state.
the
results
of
that
analysis,
however,
can
be
easily
applied
to
the
three-state
area,
the
other
region
in
the
case.
first,
i
should
like
to
review
the
teaching
of
the
court
on
the
question
of
delineation
of
a
geographic
market.
we
are
speaking
here
of
a
case
involving
a
horizontal
merger,
and
in
such
a
case,
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
why
the
question
of
the
geographic
dimension
of
the
market
is
essential.
for
one,
unless
we
know
that
outlines
of
the
market,
we
would
not
in
fact
know
that
true
horizontal
competition
existed
if
a
firm
sold
in
california
and
another
firm
sold
in
new
york,
it
would
not
make
sense
to
speak
of
a
horizontal
merger
or
horizontal
competition.
we
want
to
be
sure
that
the
firms
are
in
the
same
geographic
area
competing
one
with
the
other.
secondly
and
more
importantly,
since
for
reasons
which
have
been
developed
in
all
the
section
7
cases
in
this
court,
market
shares
are
a
principle
guide
to
the
evaluation
of
probable
anticompetitive
effect.
it
is
essential
that
we
have
a
geographic
market
definition
that
avoids
meaningless
market
percentages.
market
percentages
would
be
meaningless
in
the
case
of
an
improper
geographic
definition
because
the
market
may
be
so
narrowly
drawn
as
to
yield
huge
and
terrifying
results
when
in
fact
no
such
economic
consequence
exists
or
market
shares
may
be
so
broadly
drawn
as
to
water
down
the
true
economic
consequences
of
a
merger.
now,
if
we
consider
the
purpose
of
market
definition,
the
necessary
implication
is
that
what
we
wish
to
know
is
whether
other
sellers
are
capable
of
providing
direct
restraints
on
the
ability
of
the
merging
firm
to
raise
prices.
let
me
illustrate
what
i
mean.
i
shall
take
two
extreme
cases.
let
us
suppose
we
have
100
paper
clip
producers
in
maryland
and
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
but
mysteriously
this
month,
only
two
sell
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
they
merged.
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
this
month
these
two
constituted
100%
of
the
sales
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
calling
the
district
of
columbia
a
market,
would
be
a
meaningless
act.
if
after
the
merger,
the
company
fills
its
oaths
and
raises
its
prices,
it
may
be
that
every
buyer
in
the
district
of
columbia
will
instantaneously
switch
to
98
other
producers
of
paper
clips
in
the
area.
in
other
words,
to
generalize,
if
other
sellers
can
sell
to
consumers
in
the
area
as
readily
as
those
selling
there,
the
definition
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
geographic
market
is
economically
meaningless.
now,
to
take
the
other
illustration,
let
us
assume
we
have
two
producers
of
concrete
in
and
around
the
district
of
columbia.
we
have
other
producers
of
concrete
in
florida,
new
york,
tennessee,
and
points
west.
a
merger
of
the
two
local
producers
would
cause
concern
since
prices
can
be
raised
quite
a
bit
before
the
buyers
can
economically
turn
to
alternate
sources
of
supply
in
distant
parts
of
the
country.
hence,
in
that
case,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
say
that
sales
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
the
market
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
market.
note
that
the
barrier
is
relative,
it
is
always
relative.
the
question
is
not
whether
there
is
an
absolute
impossibility
of
other
sellers
coming
in.
the
question
is,
whether
those
in
the
market
have
a
significant
advantage
which
they
can
utilize
before
other
sellers
are
going
into
the
market?
now,
i
should
like
to
apply
this
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
to
the
record
in
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
we
have
appropriately
defined
the
market
when
we
complain
that
the
acquisition
substantially
affected
competition
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
i
believe
that
the
evidence
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
companies
selling
in
wisconsin
did
in
fact
have
an
appreciable
advantage
over
those
not
selling
in
wisconsin.
i
believe
that
we
have
two
types
of
evidence
in
the
record
which
establishes
that
there
was
such
an
advantage.
i
believe
that
the
evidence
for
one
indicated
that
location
of
production
does
play
a
role
and
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
meant
selling
in
wisconsin
since
we
include
in
our
market
all
those
companies
that
sell
in
wisconsin
whether
they
produce
in
wisconsin,
minnesota
or
illinois.our
concern
is
those
selling
in
wisconsin
and
not
producing
in
wisconsin.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
believe
these
advantages
therefore
consist
of
two
overlapping
factors.
one,
locational
advantages;
and
secondly,
and
more
importantly,
the
sustained
investment
in
advertising
to
create
brand
preferences
and
sustained
attention
to
distributorship
relationships.
we
believe
that
these
factors
together
mean
that
the
companies
not
now
selling
in
wisconsin,
even
though
conveniently
located,
do
not
represent
a
direct
competitive
restraint
upon
those
companies
now
selling
in
wisconsin.
we
believe
that
these
two
major
factors,
locational
advantages
and
brand
differentiation
and
distributorship
relationships
together
present
the
barrier
that
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
warrants
wisconsin
as
a
market.
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
mean,
the
location
of
the
source
of
production,
mr.
justice.
i
should
like
to
--
i'm
going
right
into
that
if
you
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
but
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
defining
the
market
in
terms
of
those
selling
there
as
i
shall
show
in
the
moment.
now,
dealing
with
locational
advantages,
i
should
like
to
demonstrate
that
the
record
establishes
that
such
advantages
exist.
i
should
like
first
to
ask
the
court's
indulgence
and
request
that
it
look
at
page
193
of
the
transcript
of
record.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
193.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
finding
30
which
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
now,
i
asked
the
court
to
look
at
the
chart
on
page
193
which
shows
the
sales
of
pabst
and
blatz
and
to
look
at
the
state
of
california
where
in
1957,
blatz
sold
17,653
barrels
of
beer.
the
merger
occurred
in
1958
and
the
record
demonstrates
that
as
soon
as
the
merger
occurred,
the
pabst
brewing
company
began
to
brew
blatz
beer
in
the
california
brewery
of
pabst.
prior
to
that,
blatz
beer
was
brewed
in
milwaukee
and
only
in
milwaukee.
in
1958,
a
minor
amount
of
production
of
blatz
beer
began
and
if
we
look
at
page
194,
we
see
that
sales
of
blatz
in
california
went
up
to
28,000
odd
barrels.
in
1959,
blatz
beer
was
produced
in
quantity
in
california
for
the
first
time.
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at
page
195
and
california
production
--
california
sales
of
blatz
beer
has
jumped
to
80,600
barrels,
an
increase
of
450%
over
the
year
prior
to
the
merger.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i'm
sure
that
advertising
played
a
role
mr.
justice
white
but
i
cannot
believe
that
advertising
can
account
for
that
dramatic
shift
and
i
wish
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
confirming
facts.
pabst
had
three
other
breweries,
one
in
milwaukee
which
need
not
concern
us,
one
in
illinois
and
one
in
newark.
if
we
go
through
the
same
exercise
on
pages
193,
194,
and
195
and
if
we
look
at
sales
in
illinois
after
pabst
begins
to
brew
blatz
beer
in
illinois,
and
if
we
look
at
sales
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
which
the
newark
brewery
of
pabst
supplied,
we
find
a
dramatic,
less
dramatic
than
450%
or
nonetheless
dramatic
rise
in
the
sale
of
blatz
beer
associated
with
the
production
of
blatz
beer
for
the
first
time
in
those
areas.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
pabst
beer
went
down.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
that
could
be
do
for
any
number
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
was
a
documentary
case.
but
we
have
other
evidence
in
the
record
to
which
i
should
like
to
turn
to
confirm
cumulatively
the
inference
i
am
asking
this
court
to
draw
from
this
data.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
but
we
believe
advertising
is
very
important.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
and
it
may
well
be
that
there
were
some
increase
in
the
advertising
expenditures,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
now,
a
second
piece
of
evidence
establishing
that
there
locational
advantages
in
the
brewing
industry,
is
the
fact
that
blatz,
the
acquired
company
which
had
but
one
brewery
in
milwaukee,
had
in
fact
over
the
years
sold
most
of
its
beer
in
the
area
proximate
to
milwaukee.
in
1957,
it
sold
30%
of
its
beer
in
wisconsin
alone.
it
sold
over
60%
of
its
beer
in
the
three-state
area,
wisconsin,
illinois,
and
michigan.
i
submit
that
this
again
indicates
clearly
the
presence
of
locational
advantages
associated
with
the
production.
thirdly,
i
note
that
pabst
itself
which
had
four
breweries
located
throughout
the
country
sold
50%
--
made
50%
of
its
sales
in
the
four
states
in
which
it
had
breweries,
wisconsin,
california,
illinois,
and
new
york
rather
than
new
jersey
since
the
newark
brewery
supplied
new
york,
50%
of
all
pabst
sales
were
made
where
it
had
breweries.
fourth,
i
suggest
that
the
record
shows
that
most
of
the
sales
to
wisconsin
buyers
came
from
wisconsin
breweries
or
from
breweries
right
across
the
state
line.
over
90%
of
the
sales
of
beer
in
wisconsin
came
from
wisconsin
or
minnesota.
there
were
a
few
importers
from
illinois
but
the
overwhelming
amount
of
beer
consumed
in
wisconsin
came
from
breweries
near
wisconsin.
i
submit
that
this
evidence
together
requires
the
conclusion
that
production
--
location
of
production
does
necessarily
affect
competition
and
i
suggest
that
this
evidence
at
least
gives
us
an
outer
limit
in
defining
the
sellers
who
can
affect
price
restraints
on
the
ability
of
the
merging
company
to
raise
prices
or
exploit
their
market
position.
i
suggest
that
only
those
breweries
proximate
to
wisconsin
or
in
wisconsin
need
be
considered.
now,
in
addition
to
that
outer
limit
and
overlapping
it,
i
suggest
that
there
are
major
advertising
and
distributional
elements
in
this
case
which
again
limit
the
ability
of
sellers
to
market
in
wisconsin.
i
have
at
this
point,
i
hope,
defined
the
outer
limits
of
possible
sellers
in
wisconsin.
i
shall
now
hope
to
show
that
within
those
outer
limits,
those
companies
that
have
made
substantial
investment
in
creating
brand
preferences
and
distributional
outlets
have
a
distinct
and
decided
advantage
over
those
companies
that
have
not.
i
wish
to
turn
first
to
a
statement
by
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
pabst
on
page
130
of
the
record.
we
find
there
that
the
chairman
harris
perlstein
testifies,
this
is
a
deposition,
that
you
can
only
increase
sales
by
winning
more
consumers
to
your
brand.
the
real
sale
struggle
is
the
struggle
between
brands
of
beer
and
everything
that
goes
with
reaching
the
consumer
place
a
part
in
increasing
sales.
you've
got
to
secure
a
distribution
in
retail
outlets
in
a
maximum
number
of
retail
outlets,
that's
point
number
one.
you've
got
to
get
your
beer
where
people
can
buy
it.
you've
got
to
present
it
through
advertising,
one
kind
or
another,
whether
it
would
be
media
advertising
or
whether
it
would
be
what
we
call
point
of
sale
advertising.
you've
got
to
do
all
these
things.
it's
a
many
sided
process.
secondly,
on
page
272
of
the
record,
we
got
an
indication
of
advertising
expenditures
in
this
industry.
we
find
that
pabst
spent
over
$8
million
in
1956
on
advertising,
over
$8.5
million
in
1958,
the
year
of
--
i'm
sorry
--
in
1957,
the
year
before
the
merger,
over
$6
million
in
1958,
etcetera.
we
find
that
about
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
were
spent
by
pabst
in
1960
in
wisconsin
alone,
half
a
million
dollars
in
1958.
obviously,
this
is
an
industry
in
which
advertising
is
of
critical
importance
as
television
will
tell
you.
another
indication
of
the
importance
of
brand
preference
which
is
indicated
by
this
record
is
the
phenomenon
of
blatz
prior
to
the
merger,
though,
it
had
a
far
--
a
smaller
brewery
in
milwaukee
itself
than
pabst.
nonetheless,
outselling
pabst
year
in
and
year
out
in
wisconsin,
it
was
as
both
companies
were
conveniently
located
and
yet
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
blatz
had
a
greater
grip
on
the
wisconsin
market.
finally,
we
note
that
the
prices
charged
the
wisconsin
distributors
for
blatz
beer
after
the
merger
in
24
12-ounce
bottles
was
higher
than
prices
charged
elsewhere.
it
would
indicate
that
if
one
could
differentiate
in
prices
that
a
separate
market
exist.i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
is
a
finding
of
the
court
below
to
that
effect
on
page
467,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
finding
29.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
after
the
acquisition,
the
price
charge
distributors
in
wisconsin
for
blatz
beer
were
generally
higher
than
that
charge
elsewhere.
i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
have
not
said
that
but
mr.
justice,
whether
it
was
true
before
or
after,
the
implication
would
be
the
same
namely
that
wisconsin
constitutes
a
disparate
market
in
which
a
different
price
can
be
maintained.
now,
i
should
like
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
appendix
b,
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
50,
because
we
think
that
the
evidence
set
forth
on
that
appendix
--
this
is
the
compilation
of
evidence
in
the
record
of
course,
can
only
lead
to
one
conclusion.
what
we
see
in
appendix
b
is
a
list
of
the
identity
of
those
selling
in
wisconsin
over
a
seven-year
period.
we
also
see
their
market
shares.
if
you
look
at
the
market
shares
and
if
you
look
at
the
identity
of
the
sellers,
one
is
struck
by
the
remarkable
uniformity
of
figures.
there
are
changes
indeed.
but
if
wisconsin
were
meaningless,
if
wisconsin
had
no
economic
significance,
if
those
outside
the
wisconsin
market
and
not
now
selling
there
could
instantaneously
invade
and
pick
up
and
sell.
if
there
were
no
significant
barriers,
we
would
not
get
this
type
of
uniformity
in
identity
and
uniformity
in
market
shares.
now,
the
selection
of
wisconsin
in
the
first
instance
as
a
market
area
in
which
to
measure
the
impact
of
the
market
was
not
fortuitous.
wisconsin
is
the
home
state
of
both
breweries.
the
only
blatz
brewery
was
in
wisconsin.
a
major
pabst
brewery
was
in
wisconsin.
wisconsin
was
a
very
important
state
for
both
companies.
30%
of
blatz's
business
had
been
done
in
wisconsin,
13%
of
pabst
business
had
been
done
in
wisconsin.
far
above
what
one
would
have
expected
to
find
had
wisconsin
had
been
just
another
state.
thirdly,
we
believe
that
state
borders
do
have
some
relevance
to
the
economic
reality
of
the
marketplace.
there
are
regulations
on
advertising
and
promotion
which
are
statewide.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
indicating
that
beer
companies
address
their
advertising
and
promotions
on
a
statewide
basis
because
of
these
regulations.
fourth,
wisconsin
has
a
unique
importance
as
a
beer
consuming
state.
beer
is
associated
with
wisconsin
and
it
has
greater
per
capita
consumption
than
any
other
state
in
the
union.
fifth,
it
is
a
substantial
market.
three
million
barrels
of
beer
are
sold
in
wisconsin.
the
federal
excise
tax
on
sales
of
beer
in
wisconsin
amounted
to
$27
million
alone.
department
of
commerce
figures
indicate
a
total
beer
industry
of
something
like
$6
billion,
that
wisconsin
represents
3.3%
of
total
beer
consumption.
we
have
a
wisconsin
market
of
$200
million
not
a
de
minimis
market.
we
submit
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
unrebutted
at
this
point
of
locational
advantages
which
sets
the
outer
perimeter
of
those
that
can
sell
in
wisconsin.
and
of
advertising
and
distributional
advantages
which
suggest
that
those
selling
in
wisconsin
now
have
a
distinct
advantage
over
those
not
now
selling
in
wisconsin
whether
located
in
wisconsin
or
nearby.
we
suggest
that
these
two
factors
are
sufficient
to
establish
that
wisconsin
is
a
meaningful,
not
a
perfect
but
a
meaningful
geographic
market,
a
realistic
market
in
which
to
evaluate
the
impact
of
this
merger.
the
district
court
was
largely
impressed
by
the
fact
that
beer
was
shipped
interstate
and
indeed
it
was.
but
the
district
court
appeared
unable
to
recognize
the
fact
that
regional
markets
could
exist
despite
interstate
shipments.
this
court
was
able
to
find
such
markets
in
the
brown
shoe
case.
the
district
court,
we
believe,
erroneously
deemed
that
absolute
barriers
to
entry
must
exist,
if
a
proper
market
were
to
be
established.
we
believe
this
is
error.
perfect
markets
exist
only
in
economic
textbooks.
the
district
court
relied
on
the
tampa
electric
case.
in
tampa
electric,
this
court
looked
to
all
the
places
that
the
sellers
of
coal
sold
to
determine
what
portion
of
the
market
was
foreclosed
to
those
sellers.
the
district
court
similarly
looked
to
all
the
places
that
pabst
and
blatz
sold
and
said
this
was
the
market
but
i
submit
that
this
is
erroneous.
the
question
in
tampa
was
foreclosure
of
opportunities
to
other
sellers.
the
question
here
is
foreclosure
of
opportunities
to
the
wisconsin
consumers.
in
tampa,
there
was
no
advertising
expenditure
by
coal
companies
seeking
to
carry
grand
preferences
from
public
utility
companies.
here,
advertising
is
critical.
in
tampa,
the
public
utility
went
on
the
market
every
10
or
20
years
and
indeed
it
would
search
up
and
down
the
country
to
find
an
adequate
source
of
supply
and
a
chief
source
of
supply.
obviously,
beer
consumers
have
no
such
option.
we
believe
that
we
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
tampa
and
with
the
court's
language
in
that
case,
which
says
that
in
defining
the
market,
we
must
consider
to
whom
the
purchases
can
practicably
turn.
and
we
submit
that
the
purchasers
can
practicably
turn
to
those
now
selling
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
i
should
like
briefly
to
indicate
why
it
is.
assuming
that
the
government
has
established
on
the
unrebutted
evidence
that
wisconsin
is
a
market,
why
it
is
that
we
believe
a
violation
of
section
7
has
been
shown
by
the
record.
i
wish
to
note
first
that
this
is
an
industry
which
has
undergone
a
radical
transformation.
in
1934,
there
were
708
brewing
companies.
in
1957,
there
were
206
brewing
companies.
in
1961,
there
were
162
brewing
companies.
three
out
of
every
four
brewing
companies
disappeared
over
this
period
yet
national
consumption
of
beer
more
than
doubled
over
this
period.
this
clearly
is
an
industry
undergoing
a
highly
unusual
change.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
clark,
we
do
not
have
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
cause
of
this
change
and
it
is
our
contention
that
for
purposes
of
evaluating
this
merger,
we
need
not
inquire
into
the
cause
because
this
merger
is
an
acquisition
of
a
viable
company.
if
it
isn't
a
viable
company,
that
is
for
the
defense
to
prove
and
we
assert
that
it
is.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
--
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
we
find
a
similar
change
in
the
structure
of
the
beer
industry
and
what
we
have
in
the
record
is
that
in
the
six-year
period
from
1955
to
1961
alone,
we
have
a
30%
decline.
they
were
77
selling
in
1955.
there
were
54
selling
in
1961.
now,
less
54
brewing
companies
appeared
to
be
very
substantial
number.
let
me
bring
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
of
concentration
in
the
wisconsin
market.
there
are
indeed
54
companies
but
the
top
four
accounts
for
48%
of
all
sales
in
1957
and
a
considerably
higher
percentage
of
all
sales
now.
so
it's
a
highly
concentrated
market
with
declining
numbers
of
participants
and
an
increasing
share
possessed
by
the
largest
sellers.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
partly
accidental.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
factor
of
the
state
boundary
contributes
to
other
economic
factor.
now,
i
am
quite
certain
that
northern
wisconsin
is
different
from
southern
wisconsin.
i'm
quite
certain
that
just
over
the
wisconsin
border
isn't
as
different
from
milwaukee
as
northern
wisconsin
might
be.
but
i
submit
that
these
are
relative
imperfections
and
that
there
is
no
alternative
to
this
type
of
imperfection.
the
question
is,
are
we
substantially
right
in
saying
that
substantially,
we
aren't
making
too
much
in
an
error
in
considering
the
state
as
having
uniform
economic
qualities.
and
i
submit
that
on
the
evidence
that
we
have
presented
as
to
this
state
not
as
to
any
state,
as
to
this
state,
there
is
an
indication
adequate
to
establish
a
uniform
economic
situation.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes
mr.
justice
there
was
and
i
can
turn
to
that
if
you
would
like.
in
the
three-state
area,
we
find
an
even
greater
concentration
of
sales
of
the
two
companies.we
find
persistence
of
market
shares.
and
we
find
that
the
two
companies,
again,
represented
a
substantial
portion
of
the
three-state
area.
i
would
argue
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
they're
all
in
a
region.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
hamm's
are
just
over
the
line
from
wisconsin
and
it
sells
into
wisconsin.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
hamm's
is
considered,
the
sales
of
hamm's
in
wisconsin
as
part
of
our
market.
we
have
included
hamm's
in
our
markets
and
since
i
suggested
earlier
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
our
market
is
defined
by
the
sales
of
those
selling
in
wisconsin
wherever
they
are
located.and
so
we
have
hamm's
in
that
market.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
just
across
the
line.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
are
probably
small
breweries
mr.
justice
clark
and
i
probably
don't
have
very
much
capacity.
there
is
a
substantial
export
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
there
--
i
should
say
that
there
is
substantial
export
of
beer
from
wisconsin.
wisconsin
is
second
leading
producer
of
beer
in
the
country
and
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
budweiser
sells
from
st.
louis
and
they're
about
as
far
away
as
you
go
and
get
any
substantial
sales
in
wisconsin.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
you
probably
never
heard
of
them
because
their
capacity
isn't
very
large
which
is
why
their
sales
are
so
small.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
may
i
turn
to
that
issue?it
is
one
of
the
basic
issues
in
the
case.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
my
discussion
of
the
competitive
effect
issue
by
noting
that
in
wisconsin,
if
wisconsin
were
the
market,
you
have
a
combination
of
these
two
companies
representing
24%
of
the
industry
of
the
market.
we
believe
that
this
is
well
within
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
philadelphia
national
bank
considering
the
great
concentration
in
that
market
already
and
considering
the
ongoing
concentration
trend.
we
believe
that
a
similar
result
is
achievable
in
the
three-state
area.
the
percentages
are
somewhat
smaller,
about
11%
but
in
the
face
of
the
great
concentration
trend,
we
think
that
this
is
sufficient
to
establish
unless
rebutted
that
there
is
probable
anticompetitive
effect.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
it
has
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
in
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
in
wisconsin
between
1955
and
1961,
the
number
of
brewers
selling
declined
from
77
to
54,
a
30%
decline
in
a
six-year
period.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
1955
to
1961
bracketing
the
merger
year.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
issue
of
the
significance
of
concentration
trends
without
evidence
of
the
cause
of
the
concentration
trend.
now,
i
might
say
in
passing,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
particularly
important
in
the
wisconsin
area
though
it
would
certainly
assist
our
case.i
think
it
becomes
quite
important
in
determining
whether
the
court
below
properly
dismissed
this
on
a
national
market.
percentages
in
a
national
market
are
not
anywhere
as
substantial
or
as
indicative
by
themselves.
now,
the
district
court
stated
that
it
was
possible
that
the
decline
in
the
number
of
sellers
was
due
to
natural
economic
forces
and
that
we
haven't
shown
that
it
wasn't,
and
with
this,
i
agree.
now,
i'm
willing
to
assume
that
the
decline
for
purposes
of
argument
that
each
and
everyone
of
the
decline
represented
a
business
failure
and
that
this
is
the
natural
attrition
of
an
industry
that's
transforming
itself.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
were
no
new
entrance
in
wisconsin,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
by
and
large
there
are
few,
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
of
new
entrance
in
the
national
business.
this
is
a
greatly
diminishing
business
in
terms
of
number
of
participants.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
volume
produced
has
doubled
over
the
30-year
period.
the
number
of
producers
has
been
cut
to
one
quarter
of
its
former
number.
now,
even
if
it
were
true
that
every
disappearance
was
through
business
failure
and
therefore
reflected
normal
economic
events,
i
would
argue
that
nonetheless
it
is
of
consequence
to
the
court
below
and
of
consequence
to
this
court
that
this
merger
be
evaluated
in
the
context
of
a
change
in
the
industry
because
this
merger
is
not
a
business
failure
unless
the
defendants
so
establish
which
they
have
not
had
the
opportunity
so
to
do.
this
merger
is
a
merger
of
viable
substantial
companies.
we
think
that
when
the
market
is
decreasing
at
this
rapid
pace,
whatever
the
cause,
it's
all
more
important
to
preserve
the
healthy
companies,
the
substantial
companies,
and
the
substantial
competitors.
and
for
this
reason,
we
think
the
district
court
was
plainly
wrong
when
it
disregarded
concentration
trends.
it
has
to
consider
whatever
the
cause
of
the
concentration.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
a
more
accurate
indication
of
the
economic
impact
of
this
merger
is
discernable
in
wisconsin
and
in
the
three-state
area
than
nationally.
i
believe
on
the
basis
of
everything
i
have
said
here
that
you
begin
to
lose
accuracy
when
you
talk
about
a
nationwide
market
and
when
it
isn't
meaningful
as
i
believe
this
nationwide
market
is
not
in
comparison
with
wisconsin.
however,
the
merger
does
not
take
place
in
a
vacuum.
it
has
to
be
tested
somewhere
and
we
believe
that
even
on
a
national
basis,
if
the
concentration
hence
are
indicated,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
find
this
merger
in
violation
of
section
7.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
we
contended
that
that
merger
was
illegal
on
a
national
basis
as
well
but
the
court
refused
to
consider
our
concentration
figures.
it
just
worked
with
market
shares.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice.
the
case
was
brought
about
a
year
after
the
acquisition
took
place.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
--
as
i
indicated
or
should
have
made
clear
however
that
blatz
brewery
was
closed
down
quite
promptly
and
pabst
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
brewery
itself
and
pabst
began
brewing
blatz
beer
in
its
various
plants
and
there
has
been
a
consolidation
of
distributional
facilities.
however,
the
blatz
trade
name
has
been
kept
very
much
alive
and
substantial
advertising
expenditures
have
been
made.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
i
suppose
that
we
could
request
the
divestiture
of
the
blatz
trade
name,
the
sale
to
someone
who
would
put
a
brewery
and
distributional
facilities
behind
it
and
perhaps
we
would
request
the
divestiture
of
some
of
the
distributional
facilities.
it's
possible
to
revive
these
animals
once
they're
gone.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
possible
to
revive
these
animals
once
they're
gone.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
blatz
trade
name
is
valuable.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
that
would
be
a
feasible
solution.
i
have
not
examined
the
problem
of
relief.
we've
been
told
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
believe
that
united
--
the
united
fruit
company
has
been
asked
in
a
monopolization
case
to
create
a
competing
company
and
it
has
not
succeeded
in
doing
so
as
yet
but
it
has
been
asked
to
do
so.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
i'm
sure
it
does
mr.
justice.
that
would
be
the
logical
relief
and
i'm
sure
that
we
asked
for
it.
and
on
page
26
of
the
transcript,
the
complaint
shows
that
under
such
terms
and
conditions
as
the
court
proscribed,
we
ask
that
defendant
pabst
be
required
to
divest
itself
of
the
business
and
assets
of
blatz.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
they
maintain
the
blatz
trade
name,
mr.
justice,
and
i
assume
that
they
maintain
the
blatz
label,
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
they
have
dismantled
the
brewery,
the
blatz
brewery
and
they
brew
blatz
beer
in
the
four
pabst
breweries.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh
but
the
trade
name
is
of
extreme
value
as
we
indicate
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
advertising.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
points.
when
judge
tehan
said
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
a
trend
toward
concentration,
he
was
using
that
term
in
his
special
sense,
namely,
a
diminution
in
the
number
of
companies
due
to
mergers.
the
record
is
unrebutted
in
terms
of
the
diminution
in
number
of
companies
and
we
regard
that
of
course
as
evidence
of
a
trend
toward
concentration.
secondly,
this
is
a
highly
concentrated
industry
on
a
national
level
as
well
as
in
the
regional
markets.
the
ten
leading
brewers
on
a
national
level
accounted
for
53%
of
all
sales
in
1961.
the
record
referenced
this
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief
and
as
i
indicated
earlier
in
wisconsin,
the
top
four
brewers
have
over
50%
of
the
market.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
more
to
say.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
here
on
direct
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
from
a
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
in
this
case,
the
united
had
sued
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
to
set
aside
the
acquisition
by
the
pabst
brewing
company
of
the
assets
and
business
of
the
blatz
brewing
company.
after
the
government
had
put
its
evidence
into
the
record
and
before
the
defendant
submitted
any
evidence
or
attempted
a
rebuttal,
the
district
court
granted
defendant's
motion
for
dismissal
upon
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
had
shown
no
right
to
relief
upon
the
facts
and
upon
the
law.
the
united
states
had
alleged
that
the
merger
of
these
two
substantial
competing
beer
companies
violated
section
7
because
of
probable
anticompetitive
effects
in
three
markets,
the
sale
of
beer
in
wisconsin;
the
sale
of
beer
in
the
three-state
region
consisting
of
wisconsin,
illinois
and
michigan;
and
the
sale
of
beer
in
the
united
states
as
a
whole.
the
district
court
held
that
the
evidence
submitted
by
the
united
states
had
not
established
that
either
wisconsin
or
the
three-state
region
constituted
valid
geographic
markets.
the
court,
therefore,
confined
its
consideration
of
probable
anticompetitive
effects
to
the
national
market.
but
in
making
that
evaluation,
it
refused
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
merger
occurred
in
an
industry
that
was
experiencing
a
pronounced
trend
toward
concentration.
it
refused
to
consider
this
fact
because
a
showing
had
not
been
made
that
that
concentration
trend
had
resulted
from
mergers.
the
district
court
therefore
concluded
that
by
itself,
evidence
of
the
combined
share
of
the
national
market
held
by
pabst
and
blatz
did
not
suffice
to
make
the
acquisition
unlawful
and
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
with
prejudice.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
used
an
erroneous
standard
for
the
determination
of
a
geographic
market.
under
a
proper
standard,
we
believe
that
the
government's
unrebutted
evidence
compelled
the
conclusion
that
valid
regional
markets
existed
in
wisconsin
and
in
the
three-state
region.
where
you
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
we
also
believe
that
the
united
states
is
a
relevant
market
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
we
believe
that
wisconsin
and
the
three-state
areas
are
also
relevant
markets
and
perhaps
more
accurately
reflect
the
impact
of
this
merger.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
dismissal
is
inaccurate
in
that
case
too,
mr.
justice,
because
the
judge
refused
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
merger
took
place
in
the
context
of
a
dramatically
accelerating
trend
toward
concentration.
and
therefore,
we
believe,
that
had
he
taken
that
fact
into
consideration
as
we
believe
he
is
required
to,
the
merger
would
be
unlawful
even
though
measured
on
a
national
basis.
we
believe
that
where
these
errors
corrected,
the
errors
of
market
definition
and
the
errors
of
consideration
of
concentration
trends,
that
the
unrebutted
case
submitted
by
the
government,
establishes
a
violation
of
section
7.
accordingly,
we
propose
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
that
court
to
hear
the
defendant's
evidence
to
determine
whether
the
government's
showing
has
been
rebutted.
i
should
like
first
to
turn
to
the
question
of
geographic
market
definition
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
is
one
finding
which
we
submit
is
clearly
erroneous
but
we
believe
in
a
major
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
we
believe
the
--
with
respect
to
one
finding,
we
believe
the
major
difficulty
however
is
a
question
of
law
and
that
is
the
proper
standard
by
which
to
determine
geographic
market
which
we
believe
to
be
a
legal
question.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
dismissal
was
under
rule
41
(b).
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
and
the
stated
that
there's
no
question
--
there's
no
case
made
in
fact
or
in
law.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
we
should
approach
this
on
the
basis
of
whether
an
error
of
law
had
been
committed
below.
i
think
there
is
one
finding
that
is
clearly
erroneous
but
our
basic
argument
is
that
it
is
an
error
of
law
below
in
the
definition
of
geographic
market.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
that
there
are
no
locational
advantages
which
affect
the
beer
industry.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
believe
it's
finding
30
on
page
467
of
the
record.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
should
like
to
divide
my
argument
into
three
parts.
i
would
first
want
to
review
the
question
of
what
the
appropriate
standard
for
discerning
a
geographic
market
is,
and
i
wish
to
attempt
to
show
why
the
government's
unrebutted
evidence
suffice
to
prove
that
regional
markets
existed.
secondly,
i
would
wish
to
examine
the
standards
applied
by
the
district
court
and
indicate
the
error
of
that
court.
finally,
i
would
wish
to
indicate
why
under
proper
market
definitions
and
given
a
proper
consideration
to
concentration
trends,
we
believe
that
the
acquisition
has
been
shown
to
be
unlawful,
unlawful
at
least,
until
such
time
as
the
defendants
on
remand
can
refute
the
government's
contentions.
turning
to
the
question
of
geographic
market
definition,
this
problem
has
been
before
the
court.
you
had
it
before
the
court
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
a
section
7
suit
and
it's
also
been
before
the
court
in
other
context
such
as
the
tampa
electric
case
and
the
standard
oil
case,
clayton
act
cases
under
section
3.
i
doubt,
however,
that
the
issue
has
been
presented
as
cleanly
as
it
is
here
between
the
defendant's
contention
with
which
the
district
court
agrees
that
the
sale
of
beer
is
a
national
market
and
the
government's
contention
that
it
has
established
that
regional
markets
exist.
for
purposes
of
analysis,
i
propose
to
deal
principally
with
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
deal
with
the
facts
in
the
record
on
that
state.
the
results
of
that
analysis,
however,
can
be
easily
applied
to
the
three-state
area,
the
other
region
in
the
case.
first,
i
should
like
to
review
the
teaching
of
the
court
on
the
question
of
delineation
of
a
geographic
market.
we
are
speaking
here
of
a
case
involving
a
horizontal
merger,
and
in
such
a
case,
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
why
the
question
of
the
geographic
dimension
of
the
market
is
essential.
for
one,
unless
we
know
that
outlines
of
the
market,
we
would
not
in
fact
know
that
true
horizontal
competition
existed
if
a
firm
sold
in
california
and
another
firm
sold
in
new
york,
it
would
not
make
sense
to
speak
of
a
horizontal
merger
or
horizontal
competition.
we
want
to
be
sure
that
the
firms
are
in
the
same
geographic
area
competing
one
with
the
other.
secondly
and
more
importantly,
since
for
reasons
which
have
been
developed
in
all
the
section
7
cases
in
this
court,
market
shares
are
a
principle
guide
to
the
evaluation
of
probable
anticompetitive
effect.
it
is
essential
that
we
have
a
geographic
market
definition
that
avoids
meaningless
market
percentages.
market
percentages
would
be
meaningless
in
the
case
of
an
improper
geographic
definition
because
the
market
may
be
so
narrowly
drawn
as
to
yield
huge
and
terrifying
results
when
in
fact
no
such
economic
consequence
exists
or
market
shares
may
be
so
broadly
drawn
as
to
water
down
the
true
economic
consequences
of
a
merger.
now,
if
we
consider
the
purpose
of
market
definition,
the
necessary
implication
is
that
what
we
wish
to
know
is
whether
other
sellers
are
capable
of
providing
direct
restraints
on
the
ability
of
the
merging
firm
to
raise
prices.
let
me
illustrate
what
i
mean.
i
shall
take
two
extreme
cases.
let
us
suppose
we
have
100
paper
clip
producers
in
maryland
and
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
but
mysteriously
this
month,
only
two
sell
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
they
merged.
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
this
month
these
two
constituted
100%
of
the
sales
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
calling
the
district
of
columbia
a
market,
would
be
a
meaningless
act.
if
after
the
merger,
the
company
fills
its
oaths
and
raises
its
prices,
it
may
be
that
every
buyer
in
the
district
of
columbia
will
instantaneously
switch
to
98
other
producers
of
paper
clips
in
the
area.
in
other
words,
to
generalize,
if
other
sellers
can
sell
to
consumers
in
the
area
as
readily
as
those
selling
there,
the
definition
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
geographic
market
is
economically
meaningless.
now,
to
take
the
other
illustration,
let
us
assume
we
have
two
producers
of
concrete
in
and
around
the
district
of
columbia.
we
have
other
producers
of
concrete
in
florida,
new
york,
tennessee,
and
points
west.
a
merger
of
the
two
local
producers
would
cause
concern
since
prices
can
be
raised
quite
a
bit
before
the
buyers
can
economically
turn
to
alternate
sources
of
supply
in
distant
parts
of
the
country.
hence,
in
that
case,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
say
that
sales
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
the
market
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
market.
note
that
the
barrier
is
relative,
it
is
always
relative.
the
question
is
not
whether
there
is
an
absolute
impossibility
of
other
sellers
coming
in.
the
question
is,
whether
those
in
the
market
have
a
significant
advantage
which
they
can
utilize
before
other
sellers
are
going
into
the
market?
now,
i
should
like
to
apply
this
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
to
the
record
in
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
we
have
appropriately
defined
the
market
when
we
complain
that
the
acquisition
substantially
affected
competition
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
i
believe
that
the
evidence
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
companies
selling
in
wisconsin
did
in
fact
have
an
appreciable
advantage
over
those
not
selling
in
wisconsin.
i
believe
that
we
have
two
types
of
evidence
in
the
record
which
establishes
that
there
was
such
an
advantage.
i
believe
that
the
evidence
for
one
indicated
that
location
of
production
does
play
a
role
and
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
meant
selling
in
wisconsin
since
we
include
in
our
market
all
those
companies
that
sell
in
wisconsin
whether
they
produce
in
wisconsin,
minnesota
or
illinois.our
concern
is
those
selling
in
wisconsin
and
not
producing
in
wisconsin.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
believe
these
advantages
therefore
consist
of
two
overlapping
factors.
one,
locational
advantages;
and
secondly,
and
more
importantly,
the
sustained
investment
in
advertising
to
create
brand
preferences
and
sustained
attention
to
distributorship
relationships.
we
believe
that
these
factors
together
mean
that
the
companies
not
now
selling
in
wisconsin,
even
though
conveniently
located,
do
not
represent
a
direct
competitive
restraint
upon
those
companies
now
selling
in
wisconsin.
we
believe
that
these
two
major
factors,
locational
advantages
and
brand
differentiation
and
distributorship
relationships
together
present
the
barrier
that
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
--
warrants
wisconsin
as
a
market.
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
mean,
the
location
of
the
source
of
production,
mr.
justice.
i
should
like
to
--
i'm
going
right
into
that
if
you
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
but
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
defining
the
market
in
terms
of
those
selling
there
as
i
shall
show
in
the
moment.
now,
dealing
with
locational
advantages,
i
should
like
to
demonstrate
that
the
record
establishes
that
such
advantages
exist.
i
should
like
first
to
ask
the
court's
indulgence
and
request
that
it
look
at
page
193
of
the
transcript
of
record.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
193.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
finding
30
which
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
now,
i
asked
the
court
to
look
at
the
chart
on
page
193
which
shows
the
sales
of
pabst
and
blatz
and
to
look
at
the
state
of
california
where
in
1957,
blatz
sold
17,653
barrels
of
beer.
the
merger
occurred
in
1958
and
the
record
demonstrates
that
as
soon
as
the
merger
occurred,
the
pabst
brewing
company
began
to
brew
blatz
beer
in
the
california
brewery
of
pabst.
prior
to
that,
blatz
beer
was
brewed
in
milwaukee
and
only
in
milwaukee.
in
1958,
a
minor
amount
of
production
of
blatz
beer
began
and
if
we
look
at
page
194,
we
see
that
sales
of
blatz
in
california
went
up
to
28,000
odd
barrels.
in
1959,
blatz
beer
was
produced
in
quantity
in
california
for
the
first
time.
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at
page
195
and
california
production
--
california
sales
of
blatz
beer
has
jumped
to
80,600
barrels,
an
increase
of
450%
over
the
year
prior
to
the
merger.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i'm
sure
that
advertising
played
a
role
mr.
justice
white
but
i
cannot
believe
that
advertising
can
account
for
that
dramatic
shift
and
i
wish
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
confirming
facts.
pabst
had
three
other
breweries,
one
in
milwaukee
which
need
not
concern
us,
one
in
illinois
and
one
in
newark.
if
we
go
through
the
same
exercise
on
pages
193,
194,
and
195
and
if
we
look
at
sales
in
illinois
after
pabst
begins
to
brew
blatz
beer
in
illinois,
and
if
we
look
at
sales
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
which
the
newark
brewery
of
pabst
supplied,
we
find
a
dramatic,
less
dramatic
than
450%
or
nonetheless
dramatic
rise
in
the
sale
of
blatz
beer
associated
with
the
production
of
blatz
beer
for
the
first
time
in
those
areas.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
pabst
beer
went
down.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
that
could
be
do
for
any
number
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
was
a
documentary
case.
but
we
have
other
evidence
in
the
record
to
which
i
should
like
to
turn
to
confirm
cumulatively
the
inference
i
am
asking
this
court
to
draw
from
this
data.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
but
we
believe
advertising
is
very
important.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
and
it
may
well
be
that
there
were
some
increase
in
the
advertising
expenditures,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
now,
a
second
piece
of
evidence
establishing
that
there
locational
advantages
in
the
brewing
industry,
is
the
fact
that
blatz,
the
acquired
company
which
had
but
one
brewery
in
milwaukee,
had
in
fact
over
the
years
sold
most
of
its
beer
in
the
area
proximate
to
milwaukee.
in
1957,
it
sold
30%
of
its
beer
in
wisconsin
alone.
it
sold
over
60%
of
its
beer
in
the
three-state
area,
wisconsin,
illinois,
and
michigan.
i
submit
that
this
again
indicates
clearly
the
presence
of
locational
advantages
associated
with
the
production.
thirdly,
i
note
that
pabst
itself
which
had
four
breweries
located
throughout
the
country
sold
50%
--
made
50%
of
its
sales
in
the
four
states
in
which
it
had
breweries,
wisconsin,
california,
illinois,
and
new
york
rather
than
new
jersey
since
the
newark
brewery
supplied
new
york,
50%
of
all
pabst
sales
were
made
where
it
had
breweries.
fourth,
i
suggest
that
the
record
shows
that
most
of
the
sales
to
wisconsin
buyers
came
from
wisconsin
breweries
or
from
breweries
right
across
the
state
line.
over
90%
of
the
sales
of
beer
in
wisconsin
came
from
wisconsin
or
minnesota.
there
were
a
few
importers
from
illinois
but
the
overwhelming
amount
of
beer
consumed
in
wisconsin
came
from
breweries
near
wisconsin.
i
submit
that
this
evidence
together
requires
the
conclusion
that
production
--
location
of
production
does
necessarily
affect
competition
and
i
suggest
that
this
evidence
at
least
gives
us
an
outer
limit
in
defining
the
sellers
who
can
affect
price
restraints
on
the
ability
of
the
merging
company
to
raise
prices
or
exploit
their
market
position.
i
suggest
that
only
those
breweries
proximate
to
wisconsin
or
in
wisconsin
need
be
considered.
now,
in
addition
to
that
outer
limit
and
overlapping
it,
i
suggest
that
there
are
major
advertising
and
distributional
elements
in
this
case
which
again
limit
the
ability
of
sellers
to
market
in
wisconsin.
i
have
at
this
point,
i
hope,
defined
the
outer
limits
of
possible
sellers
in
wisconsin.
i
shall
now
hope
to
show
that
within
those
outer
limits,
those
companies
that
have
made
substantial
investment
in
creating
brand
preferences
and
distributional
outlets
have
a
distinct
and
decided
advantage
over
those
companies
that
have
not.
i
wish
to
turn
first
to
a
statement
by
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
pabst
on
page
130
of
the
record.
we
find
there
that
the
chairman
harris
perlstein
testifies,
this
is
a
deposition,
that
you
can
only
increase
sales
by
winning
more
consumers
to
your
brand.
the
real
sale
struggle
is
the
struggle
between
brands
of
beer
and
everything
that
goes
with
reaching
the
consumer
place
a
part
in
increasing
sales.
you've
got
to
secure
a
distribution
in
retail
outlets
in
a
maximum
number
of
retail
outlets,
that's
point
number
one.
you've
got
to
get
your
beer
where
people
can
buy
it.
you've
got
to
present
it
through
advertising,
one
kind
or
another,
whether
it
would
be
media
advertising
or
whether
it
would
be
what
we
call
point
of
sale
advertising.
you've
got
to
do
all
these
things.
it's
a
many
sided
process.
secondly,
on
page
272
of
the
record,
we
got
an
indication
of
advertising
expenditures
in
this
industry.
we
find
that
pabst
spent
over
$8
million
in
1956
on
advertising,
over
$8.5
million
in
1958,
the
year
of
--
i'm
sorry
--
in
1957,
the
year
before
the
merger,
over
$6
million
in
1958,
etcetera.
we
find
that
about
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
were
spent
by
pabst
in
1960
in
wisconsin
alone,
half
a
million
dollars
in
1958.
obviously,
this
is
an
industry
in
which
advertising
is
of
critical
importance
as
television
will
tell
you.
another
indication
of
the
importance
of
brand
preference
which
is
indicated
by
this
record
is
the
phenomenon
of
blatz
prior
to
the
merger,
though,
it
had
a
far
--
a
smaller
brewery
in
milwaukee
itself
than
pabst.
nonetheless,
outselling
pabst
year
in
and
year
out
in
wisconsin,
it
was
as
both
companies
were
conveniently
located
and
yet
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
blatz
had
a
greater
grip
on
the
wisconsin
market.
finally,
we
note
that
the
prices
charged
the
wisconsin
distributors
for
blatz
beer
after
the
merger
in
24
12-ounce
bottles
was
higher
than
prices
charged
elsewhere.
it
would
indicate
that
if
one
could
differentiate
in
prices
that
a
separate
market
exist.i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
is
a
finding
of
the
court
below
to
that
effect
on
page
467,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
finding
29.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
after
the
acquisition,
the
price
charge
distributors
in
wisconsin
for
blatz
beer
were
generally
higher
than
that
charge
elsewhere.
i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
no,
i
have
not
said
that
but
mr.
justice,
whether
it
was
true
before
or
after,
the
implication
would
be
the
same
namely
that
wisconsin
constitutes
a
disparate
market
in
which
a
different
price
can
be
maintained.
now,
i
should
like
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
appendix
b,
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
50,
because
we
think
that
the
evidence
set
forth
on
that
appendix
--
this
is
the
compilation
of
evidence
in
the
record
of
course,
can
only
lead
to
one
conclusion.
what
we
see
in
appendix
b
is
a
list
of
the
identity
of
those
selling
in
wisconsin
over
a
seven-year
period.
we
also
see
their
market
shares.
if
you
look
at
the
market
shares
and
if
you
look
at
the
identity
of
the
sellers,
one
is
struck
by
the
remarkable
uniformity
of
figures.
there
are
changes
indeed.
but
if
wisconsin
were
meaningless,
if
wisconsin
had
no
economic
significance,
if
those
outside
the
wisconsin
market
and
not
now
selling
there
could
instantaneously
invade
and
pick
up
and
sell.
if
there
were
no
significant
barriers,
we
would
not
get
this
type
of
uniformity
in
identity
and
uniformity
in
market
shares.
now,
the
selection
of
wisconsin
in
the
first
instance
as
a
market
area
in
which
to
measure
the
impact
of
the
market
was
not
fortuitous.
wisconsin
is
the
home
state
of
both
breweries.
the
only
blatz
brewery
was
in
wisconsin.
a
major
pabst
brewery
was
in
wisconsin.
wisconsin
was
a
very
important
state
for
both
companies.
30%
of
blatz's
business
had
been
done
in
wisconsin,
13%
of
pabst
business
had
been
done
in
wisconsin.
far
above
what
one
would
have
expected
to
find
had
wisconsin
had
been
just
another
state.
thirdly,
we
believe
that
state
borders
do
have
some
relevance
to
the
economic
reality
of
the
marketplace.
there
are
regulations
on
advertising
and
promotion
which
are
statewide.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
indicating
that
beer
companies
address
their
advertising
and
promotions
on
a
statewide
basis
because
of
these
regulations.
fourth,
wisconsin
has
a
unique
importance
as
a
beer
consuming
state.
beer
is
associated
with
wisconsin
and
it
has
greater
per
capita
consumption
than
any
other
state
in
the
union.
fifth,
it
is
a
substantial
market.
three
million
barrels
of
beer
are
sold
in
wisconsin.
the
federal
excise
tax
on
sales
of
beer
in
wisconsin
amounted
to
$27
million
alone.
department
of
commerce
figures
indicate
a
total
beer
industry
of
something
like
$6
billion,
that
wisconsin
represents
3.3%
of
total
beer
consumption.
we
have
a
wisconsin
market
of
$200
million
not
a
de
minimis
market.
we
submit
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
unrebutted
at
this
point
of
locational
advantages
which
sets
the
outer
perimeter
of
those
that
can
sell
in
wisconsin.
and
of
advertising
and
distributional
advantages
which
suggest
that
those
selling
in
wisconsin
now
have
a
distinct
advantage
over
those
not
now
selling
in
wisconsin
whether
located
in
wisconsin
or
nearby.
we
suggest
that
these
two
factors
are
sufficient
to
establish
that
wisconsin
is
a
meaningful,
not
a
perfect
but
a
meaningful
geographic
market,
a
realistic
market
in
which
to
evaluate
the
impact
of
this
merger.
the
district
court
was
largely
impressed
by
the
fact
that
beer
was
shipped
interstate
and
indeed
it
was.
but
the
district
court
appeared
unable
to
recognize
the
fact
that
regional
markets
could
exist
despite
interstate
shipments.
this
court
was
able
to
find
such
markets
in
the
brown
shoe
case.
the
district
court,
we
believe,
erroneously
deemed
that
absolute
barriers
to
entry
must
exist,
if
a
proper
market
were
to
be
established.
we
believe
this
is
error.
perfect
markets
exist
only
in
economic
textbooks.
the
district
court
relied
on
the
tampa
electric
case.
in
tampa
electric,
this
court
looked
to
all
the
places
that
the
sellers
of
coal
sold
to
determine
what
portion
of
the
market
was
foreclosed
to
those
sellers.
the
district
court
similarly
looked
to
all
the
places
that
pabst
and
blatz
sold
and
said
this
was
the
market
but
i
submit
that
this
is
erroneous.
the
question
in
tampa
was
foreclosure
of
opportunities
to
other
sellers.
the
question
here
is
foreclosure
of
opportunities
to
the
wisconsin
consumers.
in
tampa,
there
was
no
advertising
expenditure
by
coal
companies
seeking
to
carry
grand
preferences
from
public
utility
companies.
here,
advertising
is
critical.
in
tampa,
the
public
utility
went
on
the
market
every
10
or
20
years
and
indeed
it
would
search
up
and
down
the
country
to
find
an
adequate
source
of
supply
and
a
chief
source
of
supply.
obviously,
beer
consumers
have
no
such
option.
we
believe
that
we
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
tampa
and
with
the
court's
language
in
that
case,
which
says
that
in
defining
the
market,
we
must
consider
to
whom
the
purchases
can
practicably
turn.
and
we
submit
that
the
purchasers
can
practicably
turn
to
those
now
selling
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
i
should
like
briefly
to
indicate
why
it
is.
assuming
that
the
government
has
established
on
the
unrebutted
evidence
that
wisconsin
is
a
market,
why
it
is
that
we
believe
a
violation
of
section
7
has
been
shown
by
the
record.
i
wish
to
note
first
that
this
is
an
industry
which
has
undergone
a
radical
transformation.
in
1934,
there
were
708
brewing
companies.
in
1957,
there
were
206
brewing
companies.
in
1961,
there
were
162
brewing
companies.
three
out
of
every
four
brewing
companies
disappeared
over
this
period
yet
national
consumption
of
beer
more
than
doubled
over
this
period.
this
clearly
is
an
industry
undergoing
a
highly
unusual
change.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
clark,
we
do
not
have
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
cause
of
this
change
and
it
is
our
contention
that
for
purposes
of
evaluating
this
merger,
we
need
not
inquire
into
the
cause
because
this
merger
is
an
acquisition
of
a
viable
company.
if
it
isn't
a
viable
company,
that
is
for
the
defense
to
prove
and
we
assert
that
it
is.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
--
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
we
find
a
similar
change
in
the
structure
of
the
beer
industry
and
what
we
have
in
the
record
is
that
in
the
six-year
period
from
1955
to
1961
alone,
we
have
a
30%
decline.
they
were
77
selling
in
1955.
there
were
54
selling
in
1961.
now,
less
54
brewing
companies
appeared
to
be
very
substantial
number.
let
me
bring
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
of
concentration
in
the
wisconsin
market.
there
are
indeed
54
companies
but
the
top
four
accounts
for
48%
of
all
sales
in
1957
and
a
considerably
higher
percentage
of
all
sales
now.
so
it's
a
highly
concentrated
market
with
declining
numbers
of
participants
and
an
increasing
share
possessed
by
the
largest
sellers.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
partly
accidental.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
factor
of
the
state
boundary
contributes
to
other
economic
factor.
now,
i
am
quite
certain
that
northern
wisconsin
is
different
from
southern
wisconsin.
i'm
quite
certain
that
just
over
the
wisconsin
border
isn't
as
different
from
milwaukee
as
northern
wisconsin
might
be.
but
i
submit
that
these
are
relative
imperfections
and
that
there
is
no
alternative
to
this
type
of
imperfection.
the
question
is,
are
we
substantially
right
in
saying
that
substantially,
we
aren't
making
too
much
in
an
error
in
considering
the
state
as
having
uniform
economic
qualities.
and
i
submit
that
on
the
evidence
that
we
have
presented
as
to
this
state
not
as
to
any
state,
as
to
this
state,
there
is
an
indication
adequate
to
establish
a
uniform
economic
situation.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes
mr.
justice
there
was
and
i
can
turn
to
that
if
you
would
like.
in
the
three-state
area,
we
find
an
even
greater
concentration
of
sales
of
the
two
companies.we
find
persistence
of
market
shares.
and
we
find
that
the
two
companies,
again,
represented
a
substantial
portion
of
the
three-state
area.
i
would
argue
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
they're
all
in
a
region.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
hamm's
are
just
over
the
line
from
wisconsin
and
it
sells
into
wisconsin.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
hamm's
is
considered,
the
sales
of
hamm's
in
wisconsin
as
part
of
our
market.
we
have
included
hamm's
in
our
markets
and
since
i
suggested
earlier
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
our
market
is
defined
by
the
sales
of
those
selling
in
wisconsin
wherever
they
are
located.and
so
we
have
hamm's
in
that
market.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
just
across
the
line.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
are
probably
small
breweries
mr.
justice
clark
and
i
probably
don't
have
very
much
capacity.
there
is
a
substantial
export
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
there
--
i
should
say
that
there
is
substantial
export
of
beer
from
wisconsin.
wisconsin
is
second
leading
producer
of
beer
in
the
country
and
the
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
budweiser
sells
from
st.
louis
and
they're
about
as
far
away
as
you
go
and
get
any
substantial
sales
in
wisconsin.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
you
probably
never
heard
of
them
because
their
capacity
isn't
very
large
which
is
why
their
sales
are
so
small.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
may
i
turn
to
that
issue?it
is
one
of
the
basic
issues
in
the
case.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
my
discussion
of
the
competitive
effect
issue
by
noting
that
in
wisconsin,
if
wisconsin
were
the
market,
you
have
a
combination
of
these
two
companies
representing
24%
of
the
industry
of
the
market.
we
believe
that
this
is
well
within
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
philadelphia
national
bank
considering
the
great
concentration
in
that
market
already
and
considering
the
ongoing
concentration
trend.
we
believe
that
a
similar
result
is
achievable
in
the
three-state
area.
the
percentages
are
somewhat
smaller,
about
11%
but
in
the
face
of
the
great
concentration
trend,
we
think
that
this
is
sufficient
to
establish
unless
rebutted
that
there
is
probable
anticompetitive
effect.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
it
has
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
in
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
in
wisconsin
between
1955
and
1961,
the
number
of
brewers
selling
declined
from
77
to
54,
a
30%
decline
in
a
six-year
period.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
1955
to
1961
bracketing
the
merger
year.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
right.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
issue
of
the
significance
of
concentration
trends
without
evidence
of
the
cause
of
the
concentration
trend.
now,
i
might
say
in
passing,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
particularly
important
in
the
wisconsin
area
though
it
would
certainly
assist
our
case.i
think
it
becomes
quite
important
in
determining
whether
the
court
below
properly
dismissed
this
on
a
national
market.
percentages
in
a
national
market
are
not
anywhere
as
substantial
or
as
indicative
by
themselves.
now,
the
district
court
stated
that
it
was
possible
that
the
decline
in
the
number
of
sellers
was
due
to
natural
economic
forces
and
that
we
haven't
shown
that
it
wasn't,
and
with
this,
i
agree.
now,
i'm
willing
to
assume
that
the
decline
for
purposes
of
argument
that
each
and
everyone
of
the
decline
represented
a
business
failure
and
that
this
is
the
natural
attrition
of
an
industry
that's
transforming
itself.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
there
were
no
new
entrance
in
wisconsin,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
by
and
large
there
are
few,
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
of
new
entrance
in
the
national
business.
this
is
a
greatly
diminishing
business
in
terms
of
number
of
participants.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
volume
produced
has
doubled
over
the
30-year
period.
the
number
of
producers
has
been
cut
to
one
quarter
of
its
former
number.
now,
even
if
it
were
true
that
every
disappearance
was
through
business
failure
and
therefore
reflected
normal
economic
events,
i
would
argue
that
nonetheless
it
is
of
consequence
to
the
court
below
and
of
consequence
to
this
court
that
this
merger
be
evaluated
in
the
context
of
a
change
in
the
industry
because
this
merger
is
not
a
business
failure
unless
the
defendants
so
establish
which
they
have
not
had
the
opportunity
so
to
do.
this
merger
is
a
merger
of
viable
substantial
companies.
we
think
that
when
the
market
is
decreasing
at
this
rapid
pace,
whatever
the
cause,
it's
all
more
important
to
preserve
the
healthy
companies,
the
substantial
companies,
and
the
substantial
competitors.
and
for
this
reason,
we
think
the
district
court
was
plainly
wrong
when
it
disregarded
concentration
trends.
it
has
to
consider
whatever
the
cause
of
the
concentration.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
a
more
accurate
indication
of
the
economic
impact
of
this
merger
is
discernable
in
wisconsin
and
in
the
three-state
area
than
nationally.
i
believe
on
the
basis
of
everything
i
have
said
here
that
you
begin
to
lose
accuracy
when
you
talk
about
a
nationwide
market
and
when
it
isn't
meaningful
as
i
believe
this
nationwide
market
is
not
in
comparison
with
wisconsin.
however,
the
merger
does
not
take
place
in
a
vacuum.
it
has
to
be
tested
somewhere
and
we
believe
that
even
on
a
national
basis,
if
the
concentration
hence
are
indicated,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
find
this
merger
in
violation
of
section
7.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
we
contended
that
that
merger
was
illegal
on
a
national
basis
as
well
but
the
court
refused
to
consider
our
concentration
figures.
it
just
worked
with
market
shares.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice.
the
case
was
brought
about
a
year
after
the
acquisition
took
place.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
--
as
i
indicated
or
should
have
made
clear
however
that
blatz
brewery
was
closed
down
quite
promptly
and
pabst
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
brewery
itself
and
pabst
began
brewing
blatz
beer
in
its
various
plants
and
there
has
been
a
consolidation
of
distributional
facilities.
however,
the
blatz
trade
name
has
been
kept
very
much
alive
and
substantial
advertising
expenditures
have
been
made.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
well,
i
suppose
that
we
could
request
the
divestiture
of
the
blatz
trade
name,
the
sale
to
someone
who
would
put
a
brewery
and
distributional
facilities
behind
it
and
perhaps
we
would
request
the
divestiture
of
some
of
the
distributional
facilities.
it's
possible
to
revive
these
animals
once
they're
gone.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
it's
possible
to
revive
these
animals
once
they're
gone.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
the
blatz
trade
name
is
valuable.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
that
would
be
a
feasible
solution.
i
have
not
examined
the
problem
of
relief.
we've
been
told
--
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
believe
that
united
--
the
united
fruit
company
has
been
asked
in
a
monopolization
case
to
create
a
competing
company
and
it
has
not
succeeded
in
doing
so
as
yet
but
it
has
been
asked
to
do
so.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes,
i'm
sure
it
does
mr.
justice.
that
would
be
the
logical
relief
and
i'm
sure
that
we
asked
for
it.
and
on
page
26
of
the
transcript,
the
complaint
shows
that
under
such
terms
and
conditions
as
the
court
proscribed,
we
ask
that
defendant
pabst
be
required
to
divest
itself
of
the
business
and
assets
of
blatz.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
they
maintain
the
blatz
trade
name,
mr.
justice,
and
i
assume
that
they
maintain
the
blatz
label,
yes.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
they
have
dismantled
the
brewery,
the
blatz
brewery
and
they
brew
blatz
beer
in
the
four
pabst
breweries.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
oh
but
the
trade
name
is
of
extreme
value
as
we
indicate
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
advertising.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
m.
zimmerman
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
points.
when
judge
tehan
said
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
a
trend
toward
concentration,
he
was
using
that
term
in
his
special
sense,
namely,
a
diminution
in
the
number
of
companies
due
to
mergers.
the
record
is
unrebutted
in
terms
of
the
diminution
in
number
of
companies
and
we
regard
that
of
course
as
evidence
of
a
trend
toward
concentration.
secondly,
this
is
a
highly
concentrated
industry
on
a
national
level
as
well
as
in
the
regional
markets.
the
ten
leading
brewers
on
a
national
level
accounted
for
53%
of
all
sales
in
1961.
the
record
referenced
this
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief
and
as
i
indicated
earlier
in
wisconsin,
the
top
four
brewers
have
over
50%
of
the
market.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
more
to
say.
