j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
that
mr.
zimmerman
and
i
understood
this
is
a
dismissal
without
hearing
the
defense.
wasn't
this
in
effect
a
disposition
made
or
that
there
was
no
prima
facie
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

how
does
that
involved
if
it
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
that
involved
in
a
clearly
erroneous
standing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
i
wonder
why
--
why
you
suggest
it.
we
approach
this
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
is
clearly
erroneous
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
number
of
the
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
mr.
zimmerman
to
say
on
the
argument
of
this
complete
national
market
falling
into
fewer,
fewer
hand.
what
you
have
to
show
has
left
you
demonstrated
that
--
namely
that
since
1934
the
708
number
of
suppliers
has
come
down
to
170
odd
whatever
that
figure
is
with
you
without
regard
to
whether
those
result
of
charges
or
otherwise
people
going
to
the
mall
or
whatever
it
may
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
here,
again,
we
don't
know
whether
the
(voice

of
mergers
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

any
new
entrance?
justice
william
j.

not
in
volume
produced
or
consumed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
chadwell.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
mr.
zimmerman
made
an
alternative
argument
though,
didn't
he?
even
assuming
a
national
market,
still,
he
says,
it
should
be
reversed.even
assuming
a
national
market
i
think
is
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it,
that's
not
much
in
truck
time,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

there's
no
evidence
of
new
entrance
though,
are
there?

(voice

significance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
it
does
mean,
doesn't
it,
that
the
brewery
industry
is
getting
in
the
pure
--
pure
hands
--

william
j.
brennan,

--
without
any
