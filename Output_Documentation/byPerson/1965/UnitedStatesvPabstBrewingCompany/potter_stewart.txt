but
firstly,
am
i
right
in
reading
these
figures
that
the
sales
of
pabst
beer
went
down
in
those
states?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
clear
inference
to
be
made,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
relative
comparative
numbers
of
units
--
selling
units
within
the
state
of
wisconsin
this
year.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
it's
--
you
obviously
do
but
it
strikes
me
as
that
it
might
be
rather
artificial
to
define
a
market
for
the
purposes
of
section
7
in
terms
of
the
adventitious
political
boundaries
of
a
particular
state.
a
state
might
represent
a
part
of
one
region
or
it
might
represent
a
part
of
two
or
three
or
four
different
economic
and
social
regions.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
trial,
there
was
a
minimal
consideration
of
the
three-state
market,
was
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
those
states
were
wisconsin,
illinois
and
michigan?
justice

stewart
minnesota,
one
of
the
big
producers
and
sellers
here
is
what,
hamm's
in
minnesota?
justice
potter
stewart
minneapolis
and
st.
paul
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
are
basically
one
metropolitan
area.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
like
to
think
so
sometimes
but
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
hamm's
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
figures
or
product
--
consumption
in
barrels,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
these
figures
are
consumption
figures.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
chadwell,
i
thought
--
if
i
may
interrupt.
justice
potter
stewart
you
stated
the
question
differently
from
the
way
mr.
justice
fortas
put
it.
and
the
question
was
whether
95%
of
the
beer
in
--
consumed
in
wisconsin
was
sold
by
blatz
and
pabst.
justice
potter
stewart
you
stated
it
whether
blatz
and
pabst
sold
95%
of
the
beer
they
produced
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
justice
potter

those
are
two
quite
different
questions.
