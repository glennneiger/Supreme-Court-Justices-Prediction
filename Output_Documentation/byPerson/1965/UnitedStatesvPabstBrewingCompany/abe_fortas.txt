you

selling.
i
think
you
meant
producing,
didn't
you,
those
producing
in
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
they
have
a
distinct
advantage
over
those
who
don't
sell
in
wisconsin
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that
is
relevant
to
the
definition
of

justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
mr.

justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
sir.
what
do
you
mean
by
locational
advantages
in
terms
of
selling?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you're
telling
that
the
location
of
the
source
of
production.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
--
are
you
telling
us
that
after
the
merger,
after
pabst
required
blatz
to
raise
the
prices
on
blatz
in
wisconsin?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
did
the
government
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
preliminary
injunction
here?
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
been
a
merger
or
consolidation
or
bringing
together
the
distribution
outlets
of
the
two
companies?
justice
abe
fortas
the
brewery
itself.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
sort
of
relief
did
the
government
request
here?
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
what?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
and
since
i
have
a
vague
recollection
if
there
is
some
precedent
for
requesting
relief
in
the
form
of
an
order
directing
here
would
be
pabst
to
divest
itself
to
rehabilitate
and
reestablish
in
going
enterprise.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
recall
a
case
of
that
sort?
i
seem
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
in
this
case,
the
department
of
justice
brought
this
action
a
year
after
the
merger.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
major
complaint
--
major
complaint
asked
for
the
remedy
of
divestiture?
justice
abe
fortas
does
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
record
show
--
does
the
record
show
how
much
beer
is
imported
into
wisconsin
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
those
states?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
is
that
and
what's
--?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
quite
follow
you,
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
the
finding
of
the
court
on
467,
finding
30.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
the
offer
of
proof
for
the
description
in
the
pretrial
brief
of
the
plaintiff,
in
page
425,
are
inconsistent.
are
you
arguing
that
they
are
consistent?
justice
abe
fortas
you
call
our
attention
to
the
statement
of
the
plaintiff
which
appears
on
425
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
to
the
effect
that
the
witnesses
were
sure
that
the
brewing
industry
is
one
where
control
remains
in
the
local
community
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
this
independent
small
company.
then
you
call
our
attention
to
finding
30
on
467
in
which
the
court
says,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
competition
in
the
beer
industry
is
in
any
manner
localized
or
affected
by
the
location
of
the
brewery.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
because
those
two
statements
seem
to
me
to
inconsistent.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
so.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
point.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
the
definition
of
the
market
should
be
affected
in
any
way
by
the
words
of
section
7
in
reference
to
any
section
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
think
that
affects
the
definition
of
the
market
under
section
7
case?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
--
how
does
it
affect
the
definition?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
(voice
overlap).
isn't
it
conceivable
that
the
purposes
of
a
section
7
case,
you
might
have
several
alternative
markets
in
which
you
could
test
the
competitive
effect
or
you
might
test
them
--
every
one
of
them,
all
of
them?
for
example
here,
is
it
possible
that
you
might
test
the
competitive
effect
and
then
object.
that's
all
we're
talking
about
here,
isn't
it?
market,
the
definition
of
market
is
just
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
an
instrument
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
appraising
competitive
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
--
is
it
possible
that
we
might
here,
for
example,
properly
say
we're
going
to
test
the
competitive
effect
in
california.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
now,
what
would
be
the
way
of
going
about
that
inquiry?i
would
want
to
find
out
whether
both
pabst
and
blatz
sold
there.
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
want
to
find
out
whether
both
pabst
and
blatz
were
sufficiently
substantial
taking
into
account,
(a)
production;
(b)
consumption.
you
might
take
those
separately
and
together
to
find
out
whether
pabst
and
blatz
were
sufficiently
substantial
in
california
so
that
their
merger
would
or
could
have
a
--
could
be
measurable
in
terms
of
the
totality
of
the
figures
in
california?
justice
abe
fortas
but
your
problem
is
that
your
counsel
run
up
against
the
fact
that
pabst
and
blatz
put
together,
represented
about
one-third
of
the
sales
in
wisconsin,
didn't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
how
much
was
--
how
was
it
broken
down?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
13%
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
to
some
extent
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
some
extent
anyway,
the
definition
of
the
market
is
always
tail
chasing
inquiry,
isn't
it?
that
is
to
say,
you
--
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
to
define
the
area
of
effective
competition.
and
to
define
the
area
of
effective
competition,
you
try
to
find
it.
and
that's
one
of
these
very
difficult
conceptual
problems
that
antitrust
lawyers
and
judges
have
to
wrestle
with.
justice
abe
fortas
or
in
the
contrary
--
justice
abe
fortas
both
sides.
both
sides
by
then.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
argue
with
you
but
suppose
that
the
only
beer,
that
of
the
beer
sold
in
wisconsin
only
pabst
and
blatz
brewed
the
beer
--
their
beer
there
and
pabst
and
blatz
accounted
for
24%
of
the
sales
in
wisconsin,
all
the
rest
of
wisconsin's
consumption
came
from
out-of-state.
is
it
inconceivable
that
that
would
satisfy
the
statutory
requirement
that
the
effect
on
competition
be
measured
in
a
section
of
the
country?
now,
if
the
government
--
government's
case,
where
a
case
that
related
to
production
facilities
that
will
say,
the
merger
of
production
facilities
and
this
might
be
what
i've
now
suggested
might
be
a
faulty
definition
of
the

but
if
the

relates
in
whole
or
in
part
to
the
distribution
--
to
the
effect

competitive
effect
of
the
merger
on
sales
of
beer
then
what
i've
suggested
to
you
might
not
be
irrelevant

the
