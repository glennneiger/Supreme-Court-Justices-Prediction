mr.
john
t.
chadwell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
think
we've
come
to
the
time
to
discuss
relief
yet,
if
your
honor
please,
because
i
hope
to
be
able
to
convince
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
right.
i
wish
to
give
a
brief
setting
for
this
discussion,
if
your
honors
please,
to
start
with
in
two
respects.
the
first
is
that
the
beer
industry,
the
economics
of
the
beer
industry
is
something
that
the
court
should
have
in
mind,
i
think,
in
considering
and
evaluating
the
court's
findings
of
fact.
i
have
attached,
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
facing
page
12,
a
map
of
the
united
states
in
which
there
is
a
--
an
aid
to
the
court
in
looking
at
the
underlying
economics
of
this
industry.
this
is
based
upon
finding
32,
record
467
and
it
is
based
upon
jx11
record
149.
this
map
shows,
if
your
honors
please,
that
there
are
17
states
in
the
united
states
which
have
no
production
of
beer
at
all.
there
are
20
states
in
the
united
states
in
which
there
is
an
excess
of
consumption
over
production.
leaving
only
12
states
in
the
united
states
where
there's
an
excess
of
production
over
consumption,
those
states
being
able
to
and
called
upon
to
supply
the
deficit
in
the
37
other
states
where
there
either
is
no
production
at
all
or
where
the
production
is
much
less
than
the
consumption.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
yes,
sir.
throughout
my
discussion
in
the
consumption
or
presumption
where
i
refer
to
figures
will
be
in
--
on
the
basis
of
barrels
and
that
is
the
situation
in
this
matter.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
there
are
--
they
are
consumption
figures
or
production
--
they
are
production
figures
or
consumption
figures.
now,
let
me
show
you,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
wisconsin
is
shown
here
has
7,080,407.
that's
the
excess
of
production
over
consumption
in
wisconsin
in
1961.
that
means
they
have
seven
million
barrels
to
export.
they
produce
seven
million
barrels
more
than
they
consume.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that,
i
might
say
is
not
shown
here
in
the
year
1961
despite
this
heavy
excess
shipment
or
production
over
consumption,
they
also
imported
beer
to
the
extent
of
about
25%
of
their
--
of
their
consumption
in
that
year.
that
is
shown
by
the
record,
your
honor.
now,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
also,
if
your
honors
please,
to
the
fact
that
the
three
states
in
the
middle
west,
missouri
with
a
five
million
excess
production,
wisconsin
with
seven
million
excess
production,
and
minnesota
with
two
million
excess
production,
a
total
of
14
million
barrels.
that
total
represents
about
60%
of
the
excess
production
over
consumption
throughout
the
united
states,
which
means
that
out
of
these
three
states
of
wisconsin,
missouri,
and
minnesota
comes
60%
of
the
supply
for
the
37
states
that
have
deficit
production
in
addition
to
imports
in
other
states
that
have
excess
production
over
consumption
like
wisconsin
which
is
i
say
imports
25%.
now,
i
wish
to
start
out
by
calling
those
facts
to
the
attention
of
the
court
because
i
think
they
are
of
importance
to
have
in
mind
in
connection
with
what
i
have
to
say.
we
filed
our
motion
for
judgment
at
the
end
of
a
two-day
trial.
the
end
of
a
two-day
trial
in
which
the
government
put
in
evidence
only
statistics
and
documentary
evidence,
nothing
else.
now,
this
was
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
interviewed
404
witnesses
according
to
pretrial
discovery
information
which
we
have
and
which
is
in
the
record,
404
witnesses,
substantially
every
brewery
in
the
united
states,
a
great,
many
distributors
in
united
states
and
molesters.
they
had
chosen
out
of
the
404
witnesses
whom
they
had
interviewed
to
their
representatives,
71
witnesses
who
had
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
at
the
trial.
they
represented
to
the
court
in
the
pretrial
briefs
as
the
court
said
in
his
opinion.
they
represented
to
the
court
that
these
witnesses
were
going
to
testify
as
to
actual
conditions,
competitive
conditions
in
the
beer
industry
and
that
they
were
going
to
testify
--
and
that
their
testimony
was
essential
in
order
to
prove
the
economic
facts
with
respect
to
this
industry.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
this
--
this
was
in
19
--
the
trial
was
in
january
of
1964.
if
you're
referring
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh
it
was
after
the
philadelphia
bank
case.
yes,
sir.
now
then,
a
few
days
before
the
trial,
the
government
excused
all
of
these
witnesses
and
didn't
call
any
of
them.
now
then,
in
their
brief
--
in
their
brief,
they
make
the
statement
that
the
reason
that
they
excused
the
witnesses
was
that
they
thought
it
was
unnecessary
and
they
say
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
witnesses
which
they
intended
to
call
were
not
going
to
testify
on
matters
going
to
definition
of
relevant
markets
but
on
competitive
effect
and
they
thought
it
was
unnecessary
to
put
in
the
evidence
on
competitive
effect
and
made
that
decision
two
days
before
the
trial.
but
counsel
told
the
court
--
counsel
told
the
court
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
record
425,
the
court's
opinion.
“these
witnesses
will
show
that
the
brewing
industry
is
still
to
some
extent
at
least
an
industry
where
control
remains
in
the
local
community
in
the
independent
small
company.
some
of
these
witnesses
would
also
--
will
also
testify
as
to
probable
effect
of
the
changes
about
prices
and
so
forth.”
now,
the
very
essence
of
the
contentions
of
the
government
here
--
the
very
essence
of
these
contentions
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
competitive
--
to
the
market,
the
--
is
that
the
market
for
beer
is
localized.
the
market
for
beer
is
localized
and
indeed
the
government
says
that
that
is
the
basis
of
their
contention
and
they
are
making
the
assertion
to
your
honors
that
finding
30
to
which
they
refer.
in
which
the
court
said
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
beer
industry
is
localized.
that
is,
they
say,
clearly
erroneous.
clearly
erroneous
they
must
say
purely
on
the
basis
of
the
statistical
evidence
for
though
they
could
have
done
so.
they
had
witnesses
subpoenaed
to
come
in
to
the
trial,
39
of
these
71
witnesses
they
had
subpoenaed
were
brewers.
a
great
many
of
the
rest
of
them
were
distributors,
who
could
have
testified
under
oath
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
long
distance
transportation
on
markets,
whether
their
sales
were
within
a
close
proximity
to
the
plant
or
whether
they
were
not.
the
extents
to
which
these
barriers
are
referred
to
by
counsel
are
in
fact
barriers
to
interstate
transportation.
they
didn't
call
one
of
them.
they
didn't
call
one
of
them
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
represented
to
the
court
that
they
have
knowledge
of
these
competitive
conditions
throughout
the
industry
and
that
the
court
should
listen
carefully
to
these
witnesses
in
order
to
get
this
information.
and
that
the
court,
as
they
represent
here,
should
listen
to
these
witnesses
who
would
tell
about
the
localized
markets
and
they
didn't
call
one
of
them
to
say
so.
now,
what
do
they
have
left,
what
do
they
have
left,
this
i
say
to
the
court
is
a
factual
question
as
to
whether
or
not
their
relevant
market
area
is
wisconsin
or
its
nation.
they
have
statistics
left
and
they
have
a
few
tables
left
and
that's
all
they've
got
left,
and
i
want
to
discuss
--
i
want
to
discuss
that.
that
is
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
look
at,
to
say
whether
or
not
this
ruling
--
this
finding
of
the
trial
court
finding
30
was
or
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
finding
30,
your
honor?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
am
arguing
--
i
don't
think
i
quite
got
the
point
of
your
honor's
question.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
localized.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
these
witnesses
didn't
testify.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that
they
did
not
testify.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
they
are
inconsistent.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
were
saying
to
the
court
that
we
will
call
witnesses
to
show
that
the
beer
is
localized,
that
the
distribution
of
beer
is
localized
and
they
didn't
call
them.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
my
point.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh!
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that
but
i
say
that
is
the
point
that
the
court
should
have
in
mind
in
considering
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
finding
is
clearly
erroneous.
now,
they
did
not
call
any
witnesses
to
show
it.
now
then,
what
do
they
have
to
show?
that's
the
question
and
i
shall
now
--
i
would
now
like
to
discuss
their
point.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh!
yes,
that's
another
point
and
i
want
to
discuss
that.
but
first,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
point
which
he
dealt
with
primarily
which
is
that
wisconsin
is
a
relevant
market
area
and
that
the
court's
finding
to
the
contrary
was
clearly
erroneous.
now,
i
think
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
the
government
pays
only
lift
service
to
the
early
stated
guidelines
of
this
court
in
philadelphia
bank
--
the
--
and
in
--
and
in
tampa
electric
which
was
incorporated
and
applied
to
section
7
of
the
local
bank,
that
a
careful
selection
of
the
market
area
in
which
this
owner
operates
and
to
which
the
purchaser
can
practically
turn
for
supplies
is
the
way
in
which
a
relevant
market
area
should
be
determined.
now,
the
government
is
really
trying
to
avoid
this
rule.
it
seems
to
us
by
trying
to
define
the
area
in
terms
of
existing
sellers
in
wisconsin
--
sellers
in
wisconsin
rather
than
in
terms
of
the
section
of
the
country
which
constitutes
an
area
of
effective
competition.
it
seems
to
be
the
government's
position
as
we
understand
it
they
may
choose
any
area,
in
this
case
wisconsin
and
the
three-state
area,
where
they
deem
the
market
shares
to
be
favorable
and
rationalize
it
into
an
area
of
effective
competition.
on
the
theory
that
there
are
barriers
of
some
indefinite
significance
imposing
some
disadvantage
on
out-of-state
sellers
entering
the
market,
and
this,
even
though
out-of-state
sellers
are
already
in
wisconsin
and
have
been
to
a
very
great
extent
as
i
shall
show.
the
government
in
making
this
contention,
i
submit,
ignores
the
first
of
the
guidelines
established
in
the
philadelphia
bank
and
that
is,
there
must
be
a
careful
selection
of
the
market
area
where
the
sellers
operate
as
well
as
where
the
buyers
may
turn
for
supplies.
in
this
case,
almost
80%,
78%
to
be
precise,
of
the
beer
brewed
in
wisconsin
is
not
consumed
in
wisconsin
at
all
but
it's
sold
and
shipped
out
of
the
state.
under
the
first
test
in
philadelphia
bank,
the
area
of
effective
competition
must
include
wisconsin
plus
the
rest
of
the
area
far
larger
than
wisconsin
where
wisconsin
brewers
and
other
brewers
compete.
80%
of
the
beer
produced
in
wisconsin
is
shipped
out
of
the
state
to
these
deficit
production
areas
and
other
areas.
the
government
made
no
effort
to
introduce
any
evidence
as
to
the
extent
of
the
areas
except
for
the
sales
and
shipments
which
were
stipulated.
they
introduced
no
evidence
as
to
the
extent
of
sales
of
other
wisconsin
brewers
except
pabst
and
blatz.
now,
as
to
where
the
buyers
in
wisconsin
may
turn
for
supplies,
the
evidence
is
as
i
said,
the
25%
of
wisconsin
consumption
is
imported
from
other
states
despite
wisconsin's
large
surplus
production.
wisconsin
buyers
turn
to
these
out-of-state
brewers
for
supplies
and
wisconsin
buyers
and
out-of-state
buyers
may
and
turn
--
may
and
do
turn
to
these
brewers
and
their
competitors
in
and
out
of
wisconsin
constantly
through
the
years.
the
evidence
as
we
submit
fails
to
sustain
the
government's
burden
of
proof
on
the
facts
by
their
own
standards
as
to
this
supposed
barriers
to
sales
in
wisconsin
by
out-of-state
brewers
and
certainly,
they
fail
to
comply
with
the
government's
standards.
now,
the
government's
basic
assertion
as
i
say
is
that
the
distribution
of
beer
is
localized
that
most
beer
sales
by
producers,
and
i
am
quoting,
“are
made
within
the
immediate
area
of
their
breweries,
that
breweries
considered
important
for
effective
distribution,
that
they
have
breweries
proximate
to
their
important
market.”
and
they
say
and
i
quote,
“this
pattern
holds
across
the
nation
in
which
90%
of
all
beers
sold
within
the
state
come
from
brewers
within
the
state.”
while
the
evidence
does
not
show
that,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
for
that
at
all,
those
are
assertions
made
in
their
brief
without
any
support
in
the
record
of
any
kind.”
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
since
the
wisconsin
brewers
shipped
almost
80%
of
their
state
--
of
their
production
of
beer
to
out-of-state
consumers.
they
have
done
that
for
1958,
it
was
78%;
1961,
it
was
76%.
furthermore,
in
1958,
blatz
had
one
brewery
located
in
milwaukee,
the
only
one
they
have
yet
they
sold
beer
and
ship
beer
to
40
states
in
the
united
states
out
of
that
one
brewery.
they
sold
beer
--
pabst
sold
beer
in
all
48
states.
the
record
shows
that
the
vast
bulk
of
the
sales
of
both
pabst
and
blatz
was
made
--
were
made
out
of
wisconsin,
pabst,
78
--
85%
and
blatz,
77%.
almost
69%
of
the
output
of
the
pabst
brewery
in
milwaukee
was
sold
out
of
wisconsin.
and
these
shipments
were
made
nationwide
so
far
as
blatz
was
concerned.
they
were
made
in
a
great
many
states
so
far
as
the
pabst
brand
of
beer
was
concerned
and
those
states
included
the
southeast,
the
west
coast,
the
northwest
and
other
areas
either
out
of
peoria
which
is
in
illinois
or
out
of
milwaukee
showing
the
widespread
distribution
of
beer
throughout
united
states
from
the
middle
west,
necessarily
so,
in
view
of
this
large
excess
production
in
these
three
states
to
which
i
have
referred.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
section
in
the
country.
they
referred
to
a
geographic
section.
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
do.
the
court
has
--
the
court
have
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
court
has
always
--
this
court
has
held
that
the
first
thing
to
do,
the
necessary
predicate
to
a
determination
of
competitive
effect
is
first
to
establish
your
market
area.
and
the
market
area
is
established
according
to
the
rules
this
court
has
laid
down
in
philadelphia
bank
and
elsewhere.
and
in
philadelphia
bank,
they
took
evidence
to
show
that
the
trial
court
did,
that
the
business
of
banking
was
local.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
order
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
correct.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
unless
it's
an
area
of
effective
competition
theory.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
you
would
want
to
find
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
the
first
thing
to
do
as
established
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
to
ascertain
a
relevant
market
area
for
the
product.
now,
the
product
here
is
beer.
you
must
ascertain
the
area
and
i
agree,
i
agree.
there
could
be,
i
presume,
it's
conceivable.
there
could
be
a
relevant
market
area
of
effective
competition
in
wisconsin.
i
say
that
that's
the
area
that
they
have
chosen
for
the
testing
of
this
market
along
with
the
three-state
area.
they
have
chosen
that
and
that
they
mention
that.
they
haven't
chosen
any
other.
so
the
question
now
is,
is
wisconsin
taken
out
for
an
example,
is
wisconsin
an
area
of
effective
competition?
can
the
sellers
in
wisconsin
look
to
brewers
outside
of
the
state
for
their
beer
as
well
as
within
the
state?
if
so,
that
broadens
the
area
of
effective
competition
and
the
percentages
in
wisconsin
are
not
controlling.
the
percentage
are
controlling
as
to
the
area
which
is
one
of
effective
competition
within
which
customers
or
buyers
can
turn
for
supplies,
and
also,
within
which
sellers
competing
in
the
area
are
actually
in
competition
and
i
say
to
your
honor
that
the
sellers
in
wisconsin
can
and
do
look
far
beyond
the
state
of
wisconsin
for
supplies
and
that
i
have
previously
said
that
the
sellers
do
complete
--
compete
over
a
very
wide
area
much
beyond
wisconsin
and
much
beyond
the
three-state
area
because
of
this
underlying
economic
fact
of
life
which
i
stated
to
the
court
at
the
outset
of
my
remarks.
now,
as
further
evidence
of
that
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
want
to
make
this
statement
in
which
we
considered
to
be
of
great
importance
to
this
decision
and
that
is
of
the
three
top
sellers
in
wisconsin
in
1961,
three
were
out-of-state
brewers.
three
were
out-of-state
brewers.
the
second
biggest
producer,
the
second
biggest
seller
in
wisconsin
was
hamm's.
the
sixth
biggest
was
anheuser-busch
and
the
eighth
biggest
was
(inaudible).
they're
all
out-of-state
producers.
now,
they
have
no
breweries
in
wisconsin.
now,
it
is
true
that
hamm's
is
located
in
st.
paul
in
minneapolis.
but
st.
paul
and
minneapolis
is
over
300
miles
distance
from
the
great
population
center
of
wisconsin
which
is
in
the
southern
part
including
milwaukee
and
madison
and
those
populous
states
across
the
southern
part
of
--
populous
counties
across
the
southern
part
of
the
state.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
something
over
300
miles.
they
have
not
included
minnesota
or
any
area
within
300
miles
within
their
market
area.
if
they
do,
they
go,
clear
up
into
the
way
out
into
ohio,
down
further
south
to
northwest.
st.
louis
is
where
anheuser-busch
is
located.
st.
louis
is
370
miles
from
the
milwaukee,
madison,
green
bay
area
where
the
populous
counties
are.
if
you
include
green
bay
area,
you've
got
70%
of
the
population
of
wisconsin
as
we
show
in
our
brief.
so,
if
you
follow
the
rule
which
i
think
must
be
followed
in
this
case
that
you
turn
to
the
area
--
that
you
consider
the
area
to
which
buyers
in
wisconsin
can
turn
for
their
supplies,
you've
got
to
go
to
a
radius
which
would
include
st.
louis,
which
would
include
minnesota,
which
would
include
areas
east
and
west,
and
you
have
got
an
area
far
beyond
wisconsin.
you've
got
an
area
far
greater
than
wisconsin,
illinois
and
michigan
and
they
have
simply
not
shown
any
evidence
on
such
an
area
of
effective
competition
as
to
what
the
facts
are,
as
to
what
the
percentages
are,
as
to
whether
within
that
area
of
effective
competition
that
goes
way
beyond
wisconsin,
there
is
any
indication
of
lessening
of
competition
or
not.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
24%.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
as
between
the
two?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
have
those
figures
for
this
session.
13%
and
11%,
13%
for
pabst
and
11%
--
but
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
excuse
me.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
it
is
as
the
government
says
in
their
brief.
it's
a
very
difficult
question,
a
very
difficult
problem
and
convincing
--
in
convincing
the
court
that
wisconsin
by
itself
is
a
relevant
market
area
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
--
problem.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
on
the
evidence
in
this
case,
your
honor
where
the
--
nothing
was
introduced
to
explain
the
statistics
where
the
court
made
this
finding
of
fact
on
the
basis
of
what
i
have
said
partially
on
the
basis
of
what
i
have
said
as
to
the
great
flood
of
beer
that
moves
in
and
out
of
wisconsin
and
moves
in
and
out
of
middle
west
that
purchasers
in
wisconsin
can
and
in
fact
do
turn
to
out-of-state
brewers
to
such
an
extent
that
they
import
25%
of
their
beer
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
80%
of
their
production
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
they
must
and
do
consider
here
the
effect
on
sales
of
beer.
but
i
say
that
the
sales
of
beer
cannot
or
the
competitive
effect
on
the
sales
of
beer
cannot
be
measured
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
accepting
an
area
of
effective
competition
within
this
definition
which
i
have
stated,
with
which
your
honors
are
well
familiar
and
i
won't
repeat.
now
then,
i
say
that
you
don't
show
that
by
merely
showing
where
these
two
firms
compete
or
where
they
happen
to
have
what
the
government
regards
as
favorable
market
share
statistics.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it's
stipulated
your
honor
that
there's
nashville.
that
is
stipulated.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
have
had
breweries
in
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
at
the
time
of
the
merger
they
have
breweries
in
wisconsin
and
in
milwaukee
and
in
peoria,
illinois
which
is
as
your
honor
knows
goes
to
chicago.
then
they
had
a
brewery
in
california
and
they
had
a
brewery
in
newark,
new
jersey.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir.
blatz
had
only
one
brewery
and
that
was
in
milwaukee.
and
from
that
brewery,
they
ship
to
40
states
throughout
united
states.
now,
one
argument
that
is
made
by
the
government
in
this
case
is
that
there
are
four
barriers
they
say.
there
are
four
barriers
to
purchasing
--
to
selling
by
out-of-state
breweries
in
wisconsin,
four.
and
they
list
them
and
they
say
on
the
basis
of
barriers,
you
cannot
extend
the
relevant
market
area
beyond
wisconsin.
now,
the
first
barrier
which
they
say
to
them
shows
that
wisconsin
is
by
itself
a
relevant
market
area.
the
first
brewery
--
or
the
barrier
they
say
is
transportation
cost.
now,
the
government
ignores
the
trial
court's
finding
that
there
is
no
record
evidence
that
competition
is
affected
by
the
location
of
a
brewery
or
that
the
place
of
production
in
any
manner
affects
sales.
the
trial
judge
in
his
opinion
and
i
refer
to
record
436
of
the
--
where
this
opinion
or
statement
is
made.
the
judge
recognize
that
in
some
industries,
production
locale
affect
sales,
for
example,
where
transportation
cost
are
so
high
as
to
limit
sales
to
an
area
near
the
place
of
production.
but
no
evidence
in
this
case
establishes
the
location
of
any
brewery
effects
or
limits
the
area
in
which
the
seller
operates
or
to
which
the
buyer
can
turn
for
supplies.
the
government
makes
this
assertion
without
any
records
of
court
whatsoever
as
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
was
no
record
to
support
for
any
such
contention.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
that
would
have
been
sufficient.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
it
would
have
been
evidence
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
sufficient
because
they
would
have
to
show
the
relation
of
those
rates
to
price
whether
it
have
--
whether
they
did
in
fact
constitute
any
barrier
to
shipment
from
wisconsin
and
other
areas.
now,
the
best
proof
that
they
don't
constitute
any
barrier
is
the
fact
that
these
interstate
shipments
into
wisconsin
and
out
of
wisconsin
are
made.
the
fact
is,
as
i
said,
that
80%
of
the
beer
brewed
in
wisconsin
is
shipped
out
of
state
and
it
is
owned
by
the
evidence.
the
government
put
in
the
evidence
on
this
subject
only
as
to
pabst
and
blatz.
it's
shown
in
the
evidence
as
i
see
that
blatz
shipped
all
over
united
states.
now,
the
fact
that
they're
able
to
do
it
and
out-of-state
sellers
are
able
to
ship
in
to
the
united
states,
certainly
demonstrates
that
transportation
cost
are
not
significant
and
a
no
barrier
to
the
purchasing
in
wisconsin
of
out-of-state
brewed
beer.
and
yet
--
and
the
government
says
that
the
record
contains
no
evidence
of
such
cost.
now
then,
if
the
government's
contention
without
any
support
in
the
record
at
all
that
transportation
cost
constitute
a
barrier
if
there
are
anything
to
it,
wisconsin
brewers
would
lose
four-fifths
of
their
business.
now,
evidence
on
transportation
cost
is
available.
they
have
witnesses
subpoenaed
who
knew
about
transportation
cost
and
the
relation
of
transportation
cost
to
prices
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
evidence
here,
your
honor,
does
not
show
that.
it
doesn't
show
any
spinning
out
which
i
think
was
the
phrase
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
showed
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
shows
that
their
sales
are
somewhat
less
in
some
areas
than
in
wisconsin
but
also
they
are
higher,
their
sales
are
greater
in
some
remote
states
than
in
close-by
states
and
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
pabst.
they
--
pabst
sold
very
large
percentages
of
the
production
of
states
in
the
southeast
part
of
the
united
states
as
the
record
show
which
were
brewed
in
wisconsin.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
--
i
would
suppose
they
sell
more.
sure
they
sold
more.
but
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it
has
any
significance
because
the
contention
is
not
made
here.
the
contention
is
not
made
here
that
that
is
a
relevant
market
area.
they're
looking
at
wisconsin.
that's
what
the
trial
judge
had
to
decide.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
what
the
trial
judge
found
and
there
isn't
any.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it's
really
erroneous.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
suppose
it
might
indicate
that
there
were
some
facts
--
there
were
some
factors
that
have
something
to
with
it,
but
could
--
if
we
said
that
that
makes
this
finding
clearly
erroneous
in
the
face
of
this
--
this
proof
of
shipments
all
over
the
country,
could
it
be
said
that
their
transportation
cost
are
a
barrier
to
out-of-state
selling
when
the
three
of
the
eight
largest
sellers
in
wisconsin
ship
in
throughout
the
state?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
pabst
ship
any
beer
out
there?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
there's
no
evidence
on
that.
washington
and
oregon
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
california.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
know,
if
that's
it,
i
suppose
it
is.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
presume
it's
for
convenience,
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
question
i'm
arguing,
if
your
honor
please,
is
the
barrier.
is
it
a
barrier
to
sales
in
wisconsin
from
out
of
the
state
and
it
is
not?
there's
no
proof
on
it
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
their
sales
increased
in
california.
they
also
increased
in
a
great
many
other
states.
there
are
i
think
five
states
or
six
states
in
--
that
we've
referred
to
in
our
brief
where
blatz
sales
increased
very
drastically
and
they
have
had
no
brewery
either
before
or
after
the
increase.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
california
went
up.
there's
no
indication
of
why.
suppose
it
did
go
up
some.
the
fact
that
they
also
went
up
in
other
states
where
there
was
no
--
where
there
was
no
brewery
would
indicate
that
that
is
not
the
only
--
was
not
the
only
factor
particularly
when
they
put
in
the
weapons
on
the
subject.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
they
are
the
largest
in
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
i
would
suppose
there's
significance
in
that.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
not
necessarily
to
make
it
impossible
or
unlikely
that
sellers
out
of
the
state
could
not
sell
in
the
state.
they
do
it
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh,
but
when
a
company
can
get
up
to
second
place
in
the
state
when
and
this
is
a
fact
that
i
have
not
mentioned.
there
are
54
breweries
selling
in
wisconsin
and
mr.
zimmerman
said,
iut
of
those
54,
24
are
out-of-state
breweries,
24
and
30
are
in-state
breweries.
that's
underlined
in
the
record
and
the
court
had
that
before
him
when
he
made
this
finding
of
course.
and
nothing
to
explain
why,
how
could've
been
done.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
25%
of
the
consumption
in
the
state
is
from
out
of
the
state.
that
is
in
the
record
and
unquestioned
your
honor,
yes.
and
that,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
this
great
excess,
it
meant
that
these
out-of-state
brewers
could
come
in
there,
build
up
a
consumer
preference
for
a
brand
or
consumer
acceptance
of
brand
and
sell
it
to
the
extent
of
25%
of
the
entire
consumption
of
beer
in
wisconsin.
now,
i'm
talking
about
something,
mr.
justice
clark
that
is
undenied
and
unexplained
in
the
record.
after
all,
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof
here.
they
--
if
they
have
desired
to
do
so,
they
could
have
put
some
of
these
witnesses
on
the
stand
that
could've
testified
on
the
subject,
they
didn't
choose
to
do
it.
they're
relying
entirely
upon
the
statistical
evidence
unexplained.
now,
can
it
be
said
where
there
is
this
widespread
shipment,
where
there
is
--
where
there
are
these
statistics
of
25%
being
sold
from
out-of-state
in
wisconsin
that
the
court
is
clearly
erroneous
in
holding
that
there
is
no
relation
between
location
--
locale
of
production
and
sales
when
blatz
sold
all
over
the
united
states?
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
government.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no.
i
have
don't
know.
they
have
--
what
they
have
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
they
have
alleged
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
of
course,
of
course.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
may
have
--
it
maybe
a
good
marketer
--
desirable
market.
of
course
it
may
be
and
perhaps
some
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
and
perhaps
in
some
respects,
a
better
market
perhaps.
but
there's
--
but
i
claim
mr.
justice
black
that
that
does
not
mean
that
there's
--
wisconsin
is
such
an
economic
island
just
because
breweries
located
in
there
are
closer
to
the
consumer
that
that
makes
wisconsin
such
an
economic
island
that
you
won't
even
expand
it
at
all
even
though
80%
of
their
beer
is
shipped
out
of
the
state
and
as
far
as
coast
to
coast
and
even
though
25%
of
their
beer
is
shipped
in
the
state,
surely,
surely,
the
mere
fact
of
locale
of
a
brewery
without
any
proof
of
the
importance
of
transportation
cost.
surely,
that
does
not
constitute
an
area
of
effective
competition
that
makes
it
impossible
for
the
court
and
the
court
will
refuse
to
look
to
other
areas
as
well.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
unless
there
are
areas
of
effective
competition.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
your
honor,
they've
got
to
show
it
with
respect
to
an
area
as
to
which
statistics
mean
something.
they
can't
just
show
it
with
respect
to
a
liquor
store
and
say
that
because
that
liquor
store
sells
a
large
quantity
of
pabst
and
blatz
beer,
it's
an
area
of
the
country,
it's
a
relevant
market
area
and
you
determine
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
that
place.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
that
they
--
i
don't
think
they
intended
that
with
all
deference
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
they
made
it
very
clear
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
in
the
senate
report
saying
that
this
--
that
section
of
the
country
means
an
area
of
effective
competition
which
this
court
have
said.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
right.
now
then,
it
can
affect
competition
--
the
market
shares
in
an
area
can
affect
competition
unless
that
area
is
one
of
effective
competition
in
which
the
market
shares
could
have
some
relationship
to
competition.
otherwise,
they
don't
have
that
the
--
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
in
philadelphia
bank
are
exactly
to
that
effect
based
upon
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir.
i
think
that
that
case
established
that
the
area
of
effective
competition
is
one
in
which
the
sellers
operate
and
where
the
buyers
can
turn
for
supplies,
can
turn
for
supplies
and
there
--
and
they
turn
for
supplies,
as
i
say,
applying
it
to
wisconsin
and
the
three-state
area,
to
an
area
much
farther
than
that.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
if
they
sold
95%
of
their
beer
in
the
state
of
wisconsin?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
they
would
say
then
that
the
relevant
market
area
is
where
they
operate.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
wisconsin,
where
they
operate.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
in
view
--
if
you
have
the
additional
facts
that
we
have
here
which
they
themselves
put
in
to
what
these
large
sales
--
shipments
going
out
and
the
substantial
shipments
going
in
and
the
proof
that
the
sellers
or
the
buyers
in
wisconsin
can
turn
to
others
for
supply
to
--
of
vast
area
of
the
state
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
they
are.
well
i've
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
thank
you,
your
honor.
before
the
recess,
mr.
justice
fortas
had
just
inquire
whether
if
i
thought
that
the
market
share
of
pabst
and
blatz
in
wisconsin
were
95%,
aggregated
95%
sales
that
would
make
it
a
relevant
market.
i
don't
think
it
would,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
don't
think
it
would
unless
it
was
otherwise
a
relevant
market.
as
a
matter
in
fact,
a
very
--
a
very
eminent
economist
have
said
that
without
first
establishing
a
relevant
market
area,
a
percentage
of
sales
have
become
whimsy,
i
think
he
said.
now,
why
is
that?
i
think
that
is
because
a
high
market
share
of
pabst
and
blatz
in
wisconsin,
if
wisconsin
is
not
a
relevant
market
area,
would
not
mean
that
pabst
and
blatz
could
control
price.
for
example,
let
us
for
a
moment,
consider
that
the
combined
pabst-blatz
sales
in
wisconsin
in
1961
where
less
than
9%
of
the
beer
produced
in
wisconsin
though
they
had
a
somewhat
higher
percentage,
24%
was
indicated,
of
the
amount
sold.
now
much
of
that
production
was
by
some
of
the
largest
breweries
in
the
nation
such
as
schlitz
and
miller
and
heilman.
each
of
whom
sold
a
great
deal
more
out
of
wisconsin
than
in
wisconsin,
although,
they
made
substantial
sales
thereto.
so
there
was
a
very
substantial
amount
of
beer
produced
in
wisconsin,
80%
of
which
was
shipped
out
of
the
state
leaving
pabst-blatz
sales
only
9%
of
beer
production.
the
huge
amount
of
beer
which
was
shipped
out
of
the
state
could
have
been
retained
anytime
in
the
state
to
control
any
effort
at
anticompetitive
pricing.
likewise,
brewers
in
the
state
or
out
of
the
state
were
shipping
in
25%
of
total
consumption
in
the
state,
yet,
they
had
a
large
sales
out
of
the
state
of
course
in
addition
if
the
wisconsin
price
became
anticompetitive
if
it
had
gotten
out
of
line.
they
could
have
diverted
a
very
large
amount
of
their
additional
production
into
the
state
at
the
--
at
a
more
attractive
price
if
it
was
lower
and
that
would
have
flooded
the
state
with
beer.
so
the
very
fact
that
those
additional
factors
must
be
considered,
the
very
fact
that
when
they
are
considered,
you
remove
any
possible
price
restraint
that
pabst
or
blatz
could
have
exercised
in
wisconsin,
shows
that
wisconsin
is
not
an
area
of
effective
competition
by
itself.
you've
got
to
consider
these
other
areas
as
well
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
they
have
25%
market
share
there
is
of
no
significance
or
the
fact
they
might
have
had
a
higher
market
share.
because
those
facts
that
are
in
the
evidence
are
rebutted,
any
inherently
anticompetitive
tendency
that
the
shares
might
show.
i
would
like
to
make
somewhat
more
specific.
the
comment
that
i
made
a
little
while
ago
in
response
to
the
argument
of
the
government
that
there's
a
proof
that
proximity
to
a
brewery
is
of
significance
in
the
sales
of
market
from
the
fact
that
a
brewery
was
--
that
blatz
started
to
increase
its
sales
in
california
after
they
started
making
beer
in
the
california
brewery.
that
is
not
conclusive.
there
is
no
explanation
of
it
in
this
record
and
i
point
--
mr.
justice
clark,
i
believe
you
commented
on
this.
i
point
to
the
fact
that
in
new
jersey,
blatz
began
to
be
produced
there
in
1959.
it
began
to
be
produced
in
pabst
plant
there.
in
1959,
their
sales
went
down
from
31,000
barrels
to
24,000
barrels.
and
in
1960,
up
to
29,000
barrels
below
the
‘59.
and
then
in
1961,
it
was
again
down
to
24,000
barrels.
in
new
york,
the
--
after
the
brewery
was
built,
the
barrels
produced
--
barrels
sold
in
new
york
were
71,000
in
1959,
74,000
in
1960
and
then
they
went
down
to
54,000
in
1961,
which
shows,
i
think,
that
the
mere
fact
that
beer
began
to
be
brewed
there
doesn't
necessarily
result
in
increase
in
sales
and
didn't
in
either
new
jersey
or
new
york.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
record,
pages
194
to
197
in
support
of
the
statements
which
i
have
just
made.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
i
will
proceed
to
do
that.
mr.
zimmerman
argued
that
judge
tehan
was
incorrect
in
refusing
to
consider
that
the
merger
occurred
in
an
industry
in
which
there
had
been
a
pronounced
trend
toward
concentration
in
the
national
market.
now,
the
fact
is
he
held
that
there
had
been
no
proof
of
a
trend
toward
concentration
in
the
national
market.
he
said
that
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
subject
and
the
only
reference
to
which
--
that
which
mr.
zimmerman
made
was
the
fact
that
the
number
of
brewers
in
united
states
deceased
from
750
in
1934
to
162
in
1961,
over
that
period
of
something
less
than
30
years.
now,
the
government's
complaint
alleged
that
the
reduction
in
numbers
was
due
to
“merger
consolidation
or
natural
attrition,”
that
was
the
allegation
of
the
complaint.
the
government
made
no
effort
to
prove
that
allegation
and
the
trial
court
merely
said
that
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
and
not
a
single
merger
or
acquisition
in
the
beer
industry
preceded
the
acquisition
of
blatz
by
pabst
and
that
the
decrease
in
the
number
of
breweries
resulted
from
the
play
of
natural
economic
forces,
that
is
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
in
support
of
that
allegation.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
in
the
opinion,
page
--
record,
page
of
448
is
where
he
starts
the
discussion
of
the
trend
toward
concentration,
448
and
he
goes
along
with
several
pages
discussing
it
at
some
length.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
that
connection,
first,
as
mr.
zimmerman
said,
the
national
market
shares
were
very,
very
small
and
in
fact,
a
total
of
a
little
over
4%
--
4.7%,
i
guess,
after
the
merger
of
national
beer
sales.
and
those
sales
were
--
that
percentage
of
national
sales
was
less
than
it
had
been
for
pabst
alone
in
1949
and
1952.
pabst
have
declined
substantially
in
the
intervening
period.
now,
with
that
in
mind,
let
us
consider
the
--
this
reduction
in
the
number
of
breweries
from
750
to
162
over
30
years.
now,
there
was
no
proof
that
any
of
this
reduction
was
due
to
mergers
and
during
that
period,
there
has
been
a
great
depression.
there
had
been
two
world
wars.
there
had
been
vast
changes
in
our
economy
including
the
development
of
rapid
transportation
from
coast
to
coast,
a
complete
revolution
in
packaging,
evidenced
in
this
industry
of
course,
by
the
convenience
packaging
of
cans
and
bottles
compared
to
barrels
and
nothing
different
from
other
industries
in
that
respect.
certainly,
over
this
long
period
of
time,
there
can
be
no
presumption
that
there
is
any
anticompetitive
significance
in
this
decline.
could
the
government
had
gone
--
couldn't
gone
back
to
the
civil
war
and
claim
that
there
was
some
presumption
that
a
decline
from
that
period
to
1958
resulted
in
some
kind
of
a
presumption,
i
suggest
that
it
could
not
have
done
so.
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
--
as
i
started
to
say,
the
rate
of
decline
has
very
substantially
decreased
in
recent
years,
a
rate
of
decline
both
in
the
number
of
plants
and
also
in
the
number
of
breweries.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no
--
no,
in
that
result
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no.
the
--
i
think
the
facts
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
but
it's
still
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it's
still
--
they
still
have
a
--
or
had
in
1961,
162
breweries.
that
is
not
a
concentrated
industry.
and
in
1961,
there
was
no
one
that
had
as
much
as
10%.
it
is
not
a
concentrated
industry.
now,
i
say
when
the
rate
of
decline
is
substantially
leveling
off
as
have
happened
for
number
of
years
prior
to
1961
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
--
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
that
trend
--
that
that
reduction
in
the
number
of
breweries
in
that
trend
toward
fewer
and
fewer
breweries
is
gradually
coming
to
a
halt.
now
then,
as
i
--
i
don't
believe
i
have
stated,
we
haven't
agreed
cutoff
date
for
the
reception
of
evidence
at
the
trial
of
december
31,
1961.
this
trial
did
not
actually
take
place
as
i've
said
to
mr.
justice
harlan
until
january
1964.
but
by
agreement,
nothing
was
put
in
after
that.
we
had
nothing
for
‘63
and
‘62
wasn't
covered.
but
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
and
the
rate
of
decline
is
diminishing
very
greatly.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
top
10.
you're
talking
now
about
the
national
figures?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
top
10
had
slightly
under
50%
in
1959,
49%,
yes,
right
after
50%
--
47%
to
49%.
the
--
it
is
not
an
industry
in
which
there
is
a
heavy
concentration
today
compared
to
many
industries
where
the
top
two
or
three
or
four
have
very
high
percentages
as
in
philadelphia
bank.
the
top
10,
that
percentage
is
not
high
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
top
25
have
more
than
1%.
you
can
go
through
down
there
before
you
got
a
brewery
with
less
than
1%.
now
then,
i
want
to
point
out
that
judge
tehan
didn't
say
that
concentration
is
irrelevant.
judge
tehan
said
that
the
evidence
is
not
proved
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
trend
toward
concentration
because
of
the
long
period
that
i
--
to
which
i
referred
to.
i
thank
you.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
think
we've
come
to
the
time
to
discuss
relief
yet,
if
your
honor
please,
because
i
hope
to
be
able
to
convince
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
right.
i
wish
to
give
a
brief
setting
for
this
discussion,
if
your
honors
please,
to
start
with
in
two
respects.
the
first
is
that
the
beer
industry,
the
economics
of
the
beer
industry
is
something
that
the
court
should
have
in
mind,
i
think,
in
considering
and
evaluating
the
court's
findings
of
fact.
i
have
attached,
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
facing
page
12,
a
map
of
the
united
states
in
which
there
is
a
--
an
aid
to
the
court
in
looking
at
the
underlying
economics
of
this
industry.
this
is
based
upon
finding
32,
record
467
and
it
is
based
upon
jx11
record
149.
this
map
shows,
if
your
honors
please,
that
there
are
17
states
in
the
united
states
which
have
no
production
of
beer
at
all.
there
are
20
states
in
the
united
states
in
which
there
is
an
excess
of
consumption
over
production.
leaving
only
12
states
in
the
united
states
where
there's
an
excess
of
production
over
consumption,
those
states
being
able
to
and
called
upon
to
supply
the
deficit
in
the
37
other
states
where
there
either
is
no
production
at
all
or
where
the
production
is
much
less
than
the
consumption.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
yes,
sir.
throughout
my
discussion
in
the
consumption
or
presumption
where
i
refer
to
figures
will
be
in
--
on
the
basis
of
barrels
and
that
is
the
situation
in
this
matter.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
there
are
--
they
are
consumption
figures
or
production
--
they
are
production
figures
or
consumption
figures.
now,
let
me
show
you,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
wisconsin
is
shown
here
has
7,080,407.
that's
the
excess
of
production
over
consumption
in
wisconsin
in
1961.
that
means
they
have
seven
million
barrels
to
export.
they
produce
seven
million
barrels
more
than
they
consume.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that,
i
might
say
is
not
shown
here
in
the
year
1961
despite
this
heavy
excess
shipment
or
production
over
consumption,
they
also
imported
beer
to
the
extent
of
about
25%
of
their
--
of
their
consumption
in
that
year.
that
is
shown
by
the
record,
your
honor.
now,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
also,
if
your
honors
please,
to
the
fact
that
the
three
states
in
the
middle
west,
missouri
with
a
five
million
excess
production,
wisconsin
with
seven
million
excess
production,
and
minnesota
with
two
million
excess
production,
a
total
of
14
million
barrels.
that
total
represents
about
60%
of
the
excess
production
over
consumption
throughout
the
united
states,
which
means
that
out
of
these
three
states
of
wisconsin,
missouri,
and
minnesota
comes
60%
of
the
supply
for
the
37
states
that
have
deficit
production
in
addition
to
imports
in
other
states
that
have
excess
production
over
consumption
like
wisconsin
which
is
i
say
imports
25%.
now,
i
wish
to
start
out
by
calling
those
facts
to
the
attention
of
the
court
because
i
think
they
are
of
importance
to
have
in
mind
in
connection
with
what
i
have
to
say.
we
filed
our
motion
for
judgment
at
the
end
of
a
two-day
trial.
the
end
of
a
two-day
trial
in
which
the
government
put
in
evidence
only
statistics
and
documentary
evidence,
nothing
else.
now,
this
was
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
interviewed
404
witnesses
according
to
pretrial
discovery
information
which
we
have
and
which
is
in
the
record,
404
witnesses,
substantially
every
brewery
in
the
united
states,
a
great,
many
distributors
in
united
states
and
molesters.
they
had
chosen
out
of
the
404
witnesses
whom
they
had
interviewed
to
their
representatives,
71
witnesses
who
had
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
at
the
trial.
they
represented
to
the
court
in
the
pretrial
briefs
as
the
court
said
in
his
opinion.
they
represented
to
the
court
that
these
witnesses
were
going
to
testify
as
to
actual
conditions,
competitive
conditions
in
the
beer
industry
and
that
they
were
going
to
testify
--
and
that
their
testimony
was
essential
in
order
to
prove
the
economic
facts
with
respect
to
this
industry.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
this
--
this
was
in
19
--
the
trial
was
in
january
of
1964.
if
you're
referring
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh
it
was
after
the
philadelphia
bank
case.
yes,
sir.
now
then,
a
few
days
before
the
trial,
the
government
excused
all
of
these
witnesses
and
didn't
call
any
of
them.
now
then,
in
their
brief
--
in
their
brief,
they
make
the
statement
that
the
reason
that
they
excused
the
witnesses
was
that
they
thought
it
was
unnecessary
and
they
say
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
witnesses
which
they
intended
to
call
were
not
going
to
testify
on
matters
going
to
definition
of
relevant
markets
but
on
competitive
effect
and
they
thought
it
was
unnecessary
to
put
in
the
evidence
on
competitive
effect
and
made
that
decision
two
days
before
the
trial.
but
counsel
told
the
court
--
counsel
told
the
court
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
record
425,
the
court's
opinion.
“these
witnesses
will
show
that
the
brewing
industry
is
still
to
some
extent
at
least
an
industry
where
control
remains
in
the
local
community
in
the
independent
small
company.
some
of
these
witnesses
would
also
--
will
also
testify
as
to
probable
effect
of
the
changes
about
prices
and
so
forth.”
now,
the
very
essence
of
the
contentions
of
the
government
here
--
the
very
essence
of
these
contentions
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
competitive
--
to
the
market,
the
--
is
that
the
market
for
beer
is
localized.
the
market
for
beer
is
localized
and
indeed
the
government
says
that
that
is
the
basis
of
their
contention
and
they
are
making
the
assertion
to
your
honors
that
finding
30
to
which
they
refer.
in
which
the
court
said
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
beer
industry
is
localized.
that
is,
they
say,
clearly
erroneous.
clearly
erroneous
they
must
say
purely
on
the
basis
of
the
statistical
evidence
for
though
they
could
have
done
so.
they
had
witnesses
subpoenaed
to
come
in
to
the
trial,
39
of
these
71
witnesses
they
had
subpoenaed
were
brewers.
a
great
many
of
the
rest
of
them
were
distributors,
who
could
have
testified
under
oath
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
long
distance
transportation
on
markets,
whether
their
sales
were
within
a
close
proximity
to
the
plant
or
whether
they
were
not.
the
extents
to
which
these
barriers
are
referred
to
by
counsel
are
in
fact
barriers
to
interstate
transportation.
they
didn't
call
one
of
them.
they
didn't
call
one
of
them
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
represented
to
the
court
that
they
have
knowledge
of
these
competitive
conditions
throughout
the
industry
and
that
the
court
should
listen
carefully
to
these
witnesses
in
order
to
get
this
information.
and
that
the
court,
as
they
represent
here,
should
listen
to
these
witnesses
who
would
tell
about
the
localized
markets
and
they
didn't
call
one
of
them
to
say
so.
now,
what
do
they
have
left,
what
do
they
have
left,
this
i
say
to
the
court
is
a
factual
question
as
to
whether
or
not
their
relevant
market
area
is
wisconsin
or
its
nation.
they
have
statistics
left
and
they
have
a
few
tables
left
and
that's
all
they've
got
left,
and
i
want
to
discuss
--
i
want
to
discuss
that.
that
is
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
look
at,
to
say
whether
or
not
this
ruling
--
this
finding
of
the
trial
court
finding
30
was
or
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
finding
30,
your
honor?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
am
arguing
--
i
don't
think
i
quite
got
the
point
of
your
honor's
question.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
localized.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
these
witnesses
didn't
testify.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that
they
did
not
testify.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
they
are
inconsistent.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
were
saying
to
the
court
that
we
will
call
witnesses
to
show
that
the
beer
is
localized,
that
the
distribution
of
beer
is
localized
and
they
didn't
call
them.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
my
point.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh!
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that
but
i
say
that
is
the
point
that
the
court
should
have
in
mind
in
considering
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
finding
is
clearly
erroneous.
now,
they
did
not
call
any
witnesses
to
show
it.
now
then,
what
do
they
have
to
show?
that's
the
question
and
i
shall
now
--
i
would
now
like
to
discuss
their
point.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh!
yes,
that's
another
point
and
i
want
to
discuss
that.
but
first,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
point
which
he
dealt
with
primarily
which
is
that
wisconsin
is
a
relevant
market
area
and
that
the
court's
finding
to
the
contrary
was
clearly
erroneous.
now,
i
think
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
the
government
pays
only
lift
service
to
the
early
stated
guidelines
of
this
court
in
philadelphia
bank
--
the
--
and
in
--
and
in
tampa
electric
which
was
incorporated
and
applied
to
section
7
of
the
local
bank,
that
a
careful
selection
of
the
market
area
in
which
this
owner
operates
and
to
which
the
purchaser
can
practically
turn
for
supplies
is
the
way
in
which
a
relevant
market
area
should
be
determined.
now,
the
government
is
really
trying
to
avoid
this
rule.
it
seems
to
us
by
trying
to
define
the
area
in
terms
of
existing
sellers
in
wisconsin
--
sellers
in
wisconsin
rather
than
in
terms
of
the
section
of
the
country
which
constitutes
an
area
of
effective
competition.
it
seems
to
be
the
government's
position
as
we
understand
it
they
may
choose
any
area,
in
this
case
wisconsin
and
the
three-state
area,
where
they
deem
the
market
shares
to
be
favorable
and
rationalize
it
into
an
area
of
effective
competition.
on
the
theory
that
there
are
barriers
of
some
indefinite
significance
imposing
some
disadvantage
on
out-of-state
sellers
entering
the
market,
and
this,
even
though
out-of-state
sellers
are
already
in
wisconsin
and
have
been
to
a
very
great
extent
as
i
shall
show.
the
government
in
making
this
contention,
i
submit,
ignores
the
first
of
the
guidelines
established
in
the
philadelphia
bank
and
that
is,
there
must
be
a
careful
selection
of
the
market
area
where
the
sellers
operate
as
well
as
where
the
buyers
may
turn
for
supplies.
in
this
case,
almost
80%,
78%
to
be
precise,
of
the
beer
brewed
in
wisconsin
is
not
consumed
in
wisconsin
at
all
but
it's
sold
and
shipped
out
of
the
state.
under
the
first
test
in
philadelphia
bank,
the
area
of
effective
competition
must
include
wisconsin
plus
the
rest
of
the
area
far
larger
than
wisconsin
where
wisconsin
brewers
and
other
brewers
compete.
80%
of
the
beer
produced
in
wisconsin
is
shipped
out
of
the
state
to
these
deficit
production
areas
and
other
areas.
the
government
made
no
effort
to
introduce
any
evidence
as
to
the
extent
of
the
areas
except
for
the
sales
and
shipments
which
were
stipulated.
they
introduced
no
evidence
as
to
the
extent
of
sales
of
other
wisconsin
brewers
except
pabst
and
blatz.
now,
as
to
where
the
buyers
in
wisconsin
may
turn
for
supplies,
the
evidence
is
as
i
said,
the
25%
of
wisconsin
consumption
is
imported
from
other
states
despite
wisconsin's
large
surplus
production.
wisconsin
buyers
turn
to
these
out-of-state
brewers
for
supplies
and
wisconsin
buyers
and
out-of-state
buyers
may
and
turn
--
may
and
do
turn
to
these
brewers
and
their
competitors
in
and
out
of
wisconsin
constantly
through
the
years.
the
evidence
as
we
submit
fails
to
sustain
the
government's
burden
of
proof
on
the
facts
by
their
own
standards
as
to
this
supposed
barriers
to
sales
in
wisconsin
by
out-of-state
brewers
and
certainly,
they
fail
to
comply
with
the
government's
standards.
now,
the
government's
basic
assertion
as
i
say
is
that
the
distribution
of
beer
is
localized
that
most
beer
sales
by
producers,
and
i
am
quoting,
“are
made
within
the
immediate
area
of
their
breweries,
that
breweries
considered
important
for
effective
distribution,
that
they
have
breweries
proximate
to
their
important
market.”
and
they
say
and
i
quote,
“this
pattern
holds
across
the
nation
in
which
90%
of
all
beers
sold
within
the
state
come
from
brewers
within
the
state.”
while
the
evidence
does
not
show
that,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
for
that
at
all,
those
are
assertions
made
in
their
brief
without
any
support
in
the
record
of
any
kind.”
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
since
the
wisconsin
brewers
shipped
almost
80%
of
their
state
--
of
their
production
of
beer
to
out-of-state
consumers.
they
have
done
that
for
1958,
it
was
78%;
1961,
it
was
76%.
furthermore,
in
1958,
blatz
had
one
brewery
located
in
milwaukee,
the
only
one
they
have
yet
they
sold
beer
and
ship
beer
to
40
states
in
the
united
states
out
of
that
one
brewery.
they
sold
beer
--
pabst
sold
beer
in
all
48
states.
the
record
shows
that
the
vast
bulk
of
the
sales
of
both
pabst
and
blatz
was
made
--
were
made
out
of
wisconsin,
pabst,
78
--
85%
and
blatz,
77%.
almost
69%
of
the
output
of
the
pabst
brewery
in
milwaukee
was
sold
out
of
wisconsin.
and
these
shipments
were
made
nationwide
so
far
as
blatz
was
concerned.
they
were
made
in
a
great
many
states
so
far
as
the
pabst
brand
of
beer
was
concerned
and
those
states
included
the
southeast,
the
west
coast,
the
northwest
and
other
areas
either
out
of
peoria
which
is
in
illinois
or
out
of
milwaukee
showing
the
widespread
distribution
of
beer
throughout
united
states
from
the
middle
west,
necessarily
so,
in
view
of
this
large
excess
production
in
these
three
states
to
which
i
have
referred.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
section
in
the
country.
they
referred
to
a
geographic
section.
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
do.
the
court
has
--
the
court
have
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
court
has
always
--
this
court
has
held
that
the
first
thing
to
do,
the
necessary
predicate
to
a
determination
of
competitive
effect
is
first
to
establish
your
market
area.
and
the
market
area
is
established
according
to
the
rules
this
court
has
laid
down
in
philadelphia
bank
and
elsewhere.
and
in
philadelphia
bank,
they
took
evidence
to
show
that
the
trial
court
did,
that
the
business
of
banking
was
local.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
order
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
correct.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
unless
it's
an
area
of
effective
competition
theory.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
you
would
want
to
find
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
the
first
thing
to
do
as
established
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
to
ascertain
a
relevant
market
area
for
the
product.
now,
the
product
here
is
beer.
you
must
ascertain
the
area
and
i
agree,
i
agree.
there
could
be,
i
presume,
it's
conceivable.
there
could
be
a
relevant
market
area
of
effective
competition
in
wisconsin.
i
say
that
that's
the
area
that
they
have
chosen
for
the
testing
of
this
market
along
with
the
three-state
area.
they
have
chosen
that
and
that
they
mention
that.
they
haven't
chosen
any
other.
so
the
question
now
is,
is
wisconsin
taken
out
for
an
example,
is
wisconsin
an
area
of
effective
competition?
can
the
sellers
in
wisconsin
look
to
brewers
outside
of
the
state
for
their
beer
as
well
as
within
the
state?
if
so,
that
broadens
the
area
of
effective
competition
and
the
percentages
in
wisconsin
are
not
controlling.
the
percentage
are
controlling
as
to
the
area
which
is
one
of
effective
competition
within
which
customers
or
buyers
can
turn
for
supplies,
and
also,
within
which
sellers
competing
in
the
area
are
actually
in
competition
and
i
say
to
your
honor
that
the
sellers
in
wisconsin
can
and
do
look
far
beyond
the
state
of
wisconsin
for
supplies
and
that
i
have
previously
said
that
the
sellers
do
complete
--
compete
over
a
very
wide
area
much
beyond
wisconsin
and
much
beyond
the
three-state
area
because
of
this
underlying
economic
fact
of
life
which
i
stated
to
the
court
at
the
outset
of
my
remarks.
now,
as
further
evidence
of
that
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
want
to
make
this
statement
in
which
we
considered
to
be
of
great
importance
to
this
decision
and
that
is
of
the
three
top
sellers
in
wisconsin
in
1961,
three
were
out-of-state
brewers.
three
were
out-of-state
brewers.
the
second
biggest
producer,
the
second
biggest
seller
in
wisconsin
was
hamm's.
the
sixth
biggest
was
anheuser-busch
and
the
eighth
biggest
was
(inaudible).
they're
all
out-of-state
producers.
now,
they
have
no
breweries
in
wisconsin.
now,
it
is
true
that
hamm's
is
located
in
st.
paul
in
minneapolis.
but
st.
paul
and
minneapolis
is
over
300
miles
distance
from
the
great
population
center
of
wisconsin
which
is
in
the
southern
part
including
milwaukee
and
madison
and
those
populous
states
across
the
southern
part
of
--
populous
counties
across
the
southern
part
of
the
state.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
something
over
300
miles.
they
have
not
included
minnesota
or
any
area
within
300
miles
within
their
market
area.
if
they
do,
they
go,
clear
up
into
the
way
out
into
ohio,
down
further
south
to
northwest.
st.
louis
is
where
anheuser-busch
is
located.
st.
louis
is
370
miles
from
the
milwaukee,
madison,
green
bay
area
where
the
populous
counties
are.
if
you
include
green
bay
area,
you've
got
70%
of
the
population
of
wisconsin
as
we
show
in
our
brief.
so,
if
you
follow
the
rule
which
i
think
must
be
followed
in
this
case
that
you
turn
to
the
area
--
that
you
consider
the
area
to
which
buyers
in
wisconsin
can
turn
for
their
supplies,
you've
got
to
go
to
a
radius
which
would
include
st.
louis,
which
would
include
minnesota,
which
would
include
areas
east
and
west,
and
you
have
got
an
area
far
beyond
wisconsin.
you've
got
an
area
far
greater
than
wisconsin,
illinois
and
michigan
and
they
have
simply
not
shown
any
evidence
on
such
an
area
of
effective
competition
as
to
what
the
facts
are,
as
to
what
the
percentages
are,
as
to
whether
within
that
area
of
effective
competition
that
goes
way
beyond
wisconsin,
there
is
any
indication
of
lessening
of
competition
or
not.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
24%.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
as
between
the
two?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
have
those
figures
for
this
session.
13%
and
11%,
13%
for
pabst
and
11%
--
but
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
excuse
me.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
think
it
is
as
the
government
says
in
their
brief.
it's
a
very
difficult
question,
a
very
difficult
problem
and
convincing
--
in
convincing
the
court
that
wisconsin
by
itself
is
a
relevant
market
area
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
--
problem.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
on
the
evidence
in
this
case,
your
honor
where
the
--
nothing
was
introduced
to
explain
the
statistics
where
the
court
made
this
finding
of
fact
on
the
basis
of
what
i
have
said
partially
on
the
basis
of
what
i
have
said
as
to
the
great
flood
of
beer
that
moves
in
and
out
of
wisconsin
and
moves
in
and
out
of
middle
west
that
purchasers
in
wisconsin
can
and
in
fact
do
turn
to
out-of-state
brewers
to
such
an
extent
that
they
import
25%
of
their
beer
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
80%
of
their
production
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
they
must
and
do
consider
here
the
effect
on
sales
of
beer.
but
i
say
that
the
sales
of
beer
cannot
or
the
competitive
effect
on
the
sales
of
beer
cannot
be
measured
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
accepting
an
area
of
effective
competition
within
this
definition
which
i
have
stated,
with
which
your
honors
are
well
familiar
and
i
won't
repeat.
now
then,
i
say
that
you
don't
show
that
by
merely
showing
where
these
two
firms
compete
or
where
they
happen
to
have
what
the
government
regards
as
favorable
market
share
statistics.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it's
stipulated
your
honor
that
there's
nashville.
that
is
stipulated.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
have
had
breweries
in
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
at
the
time
of
the
merger
they
have
breweries
in
wisconsin
and
in
milwaukee
and
in
peoria,
illinois
which
is
as
your
honor
knows
goes
to
chicago.
then
they
had
a
brewery
in
california
and
they
had
a
brewery
in
newark,
new
jersey.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir.
blatz
had
only
one
brewery
and
that
was
in
milwaukee.
and
from
that
brewery,
they
ship
to
40
states
throughout
united
states.
now,
one
argument
that
is
made
by
the
government
in
this
case
is
that
there
are
four
barriers
they
say.
there
are
four
barriers
to
purchasing
--
to
selling
by
out-of-state
breweries
in
wisconsin,
four.
and
they
list
them
and
they
say
on
the
basis
of
barriers,
you
cannot
extend
the
relevant
market
area
beyond
wisconsin.
now,
the
first
barrier
which
they
say
to
them
shows
that
wisconsin
is
by
itself
a
relevant
market
area.
the
first
brewery
--
or
the
barrier
they
say
is
transportation
cost.
now,
the
government
ignores
the
trial
court's
finding
that
there
is
no
record
evidence
that
competition
is
affected
by
the
location
of
a
brewery
or
that
the
place
of
production
in
any
manner
affects
sales.
the
trial
judge
in
his
opinion
and
i
refer
to
record
436
of
the
--
where
this
opinion
or
statement
is
made.
the
judge
recognize
that
in
some
industries,
production
locale
affect
sales,
for
example,
where
transportation
cost
are
so
high
as
to
limit
sales
to
an
area
near
the
place
of
production.
but
no
evidence
in
this
case
establishes
the
location
of
any
brewery
effects
or
limits
the
area
in
which
the
seller
operates
or
to
which
the
buyer
can
turn
for
supplies.
the
government
makes
this
assertion
without
any
records
of
court
whatsoever
as
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
was
no
record
to
support
for
any
such
contention.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
that
would
have
been
sufficient.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
it
would
have
been
evidence
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
sufficient
because
they
would
have
to
show
the
relation
of
those
rates
to
price
whether
it
have
--
whether
they
did
in
fact
constitute
any
barrier
to
shipment
from
wisconsin
and
other
areas.
now,
the
best
proof
that
they
don't
constitute
any
barrier
is
the
fact
that
these
interstate
shipments
into
wisconsin
and
out
of
wisconsin
are
made.
the
fact
is,
as
i
said,
that
80%
of
the
beer
brewed
in
wisconsin
is
shipped
out
of
state
and
it
is
owned
by
the
evidence.
the
government
put
in
the
evidence
on
this
subject
only
as
to
pabst
and
blatz.
it's
shown
in
the
evidence
as
i
see
that
blatz
shipped
all
over
united
states.
now,
the
fact
that
they're
able
to
do
it
and
out-of-state
sellers
are
able
to
ship
in
to
the
united
states,
certainly
demonstrates
that
transportation
cost
are
not
significant
and
a
no
barrier
to
the
purchasing
in
wisconsin
of
out-of-state
brewed
beer.
and
yet
--
and
the
government
says
that
the
record
contains
no
evidence
of
such
cost.
now
then,
if
the
government's
contention
without
any
support
in
the
record
at
all
that
transportation
cost
constitute
a
barrier
if
there
are
anything
to
it,
wisconsin
brewers
would
lose
four-fifths
of
their
business.
now,
evidence
on
transportation
cost
is
available.
they
have
witnesses
subpoenaed
who
knew
about
transportation
cost
and
the
relation
of
transportation
cost
to
prices
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
evidence
here,
your
honor,
does
not
show
that.
it
doesn't
show
any
spinning
out
which
i
think
was
the
phrase
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
showed
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
shows
that
their
sales
are
somewhat
less
in
some
areas
than
in
wisconsin
but
also
they
are
higher,
their
sales
are
greater
in
some
remote
states
than
in
close-by
states
and
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
pabst.
they
--
pabst
sold
very
large
percentages
of
the
production
of
states
in
the
southeast
part
of
the
united
states
as
the
record
show
which
were
brewed
in
wisconsin.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
--
i
would
suppose
they
sell
more.
sure
they
sold
more.
but
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it
has
any
significance
because
the
contention
is
not
made
here.
the
contention
is
not
made
here
that
that
is
a
relevant
market
area.
they're
looking
at
wisconsin.
that's
what
the
trial
judge
had
to
decide.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
what
the
trial
judge
found
and
there
isn't
any.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it's
really
erroneous.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
suppose
it
might
indicate
that
there
were
some
facts
--
there
were
some
factors
that
have
something
to
with
it,
but
could
--
if
we
said
that
that
makes
this
finding
clearly
erroneous
in
the
face
of
this
--
this
proof
of
shipments
all
over
the
country,
could
it
be
said
that
their
transportation
cost
are
a
barrier
to
out-of-state
selling
when
the
three
of
the
eight
largest
sellers
in
wisconsin
ship
in
throughout
the
state?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
pabst
ship
any
beer
out
there?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
there's
no
evidence
on
that.
washington
and
oregon
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
california.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
know,
if
that's
it,
i
suppose
it
is.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
i
presume
it's
for
convenience,
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
question
i'm
arguing,
if
your
honor
please,
is
the
barrier.
is
it
a
barrier
to
sales
in
wisconsin
from
out
of
the
state
and
it
is
not?
there's
no
proof
on
it
at
all.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
their
sales
increased
in
california.
they
also
increased
in
a
great
many
other
states.
there
are
i
think
five
states
or
six
states
in
--
that
we've
referred
to
in
our
brief
where
blatz
sales
increased
very
drastically
and
they
have
had
no
brewery
either
before
or
after
the
increase.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
california
went
up.
there's
no
indication
of
why.
suppose
it
did
go
up
some.
the
fact
that
they
also
went
up
in
other
states
where
there
was
no
--
where
there
was
no
brewery
would
indicate
that
that
is
not
the
only
--
was
not
the
only
factor
particularly
when
they
put
in
the
weapons
on
the
subject.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
they
are
the
largest
in
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
i
would
suppose
there's
significance
in
that.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
not
necessarily
to
make
it
impossible
or
unlikely
that
sellers
out
of
the
state
could
not
sell
in
the
state.
they
do
it
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
oh,
but
when
a
company
can
get
up
to
second
place
in
the
state
when
and
this
is
a
fact
that
i
have
not
mentioned.
there
are
54
breweries
selling
in
wisconsin
and
mr.
zimmerman
said,
iut
of
those
54,
24
are
out-of-state
breweries,
24
and
30
are
in-state
breweries.
that's
underlined
in
the
record
and
the
court
had
that
before
him
when
he
made
this
finding
of
course.
and
nothing
to
explain
why,
how
could've
been
done.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
25%
of
the
consumption
in
the
state
is
from
out
of
the
state.
that
is
in
the
record
and
unquestioned
your
honor,
yes.
and
that,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
this
great
excess,
it
meant
that
these
out-of-state
brewers
could
come
in
there,
build
up
a
consumer
preference
for
a
brand
or
consumer
acceptance
of
brand
and
sell
it
to
the
extent
of
25%
of
the
entire
consumption
of
beer
in
wisconsin.
now,
i'm
talking
about
something,
mr.
justice
clark
that
is
undenied
and
unexplained
in
the
record.
after
all,
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof
here.
they
--
if
they
have
desired
to
do
so,
they
could
have
put
some
of
these
witnesses
on
the
stand
that
could've
testified
on
the
subject,
they
didn't
choose
to
do
it.
they're
relying
entirely
upon
the
statistical
evidence
unexplained.
now,
can
it
be
said
where
there
is
this
widespread
shipment,
where
there
is
--
where
there
are
these
statistics
of
25%
being
sold
from
out-of-state
in
wisconsin
that
the
court
is
clearly
erroneous
in
holding
that
there
is
no
relation
between
location
--
locale
of
production
and
sales
when
blatz
sold
all
over
the
united
states?
i
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
government.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no.
i
have
don't
know.
they
have
--
what
they
have
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
your
honor,
they
have
alleged
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
of
course,
of
course.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it
may
have
--
it
maybe
a
good
marketer
--
desirable
market.
of
course
it
may
be
and
perhaps
some
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
and
perhaps
in
some
respects,
a
better
market
perhaps.
but
there's
--
but
i
claim
mr.
justice
black
that
that
does
not
mean
that
there's
--
wisconsin
is
such
an
economic
island
just
because
breweries
located
in
there
are
closer
to
the
consumer
that
that
makes
wisconsin
such
an
economic
island
that
you
won't
even
expand
it
at
all
even
though
80%
of
their
beer
is
shipped
out
of
the
state
and
as
far
as
coast
to
coast
and
even
though
25%
of
their
beer
is
shipped
in
the
state,
surely,
surely,
the
mere
fact
of
locale
of
a
brewery
without
any
proof
of
the
importance
of
transportation
cost.
surely,
that
does
not
constitute
an
area
of
effective
competition
that
makes
it
impossible
for
the
court
and
the
court
will
refuse
to
look
to
other
areas
as
well.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
not
unless
there
are
areas
of
effective
competition.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
your
honor,
they've
got
to
show
it
with
respect
to
an
area
as
to
which
statistics
mean
something.
they
can't
just
show
it
with
respect
to
a
liquor
store
and
say
that
because
that
liquor
store
sells
a
large
quantity
of
pabst
and
blatz
beer,
it's
an
area
of
the
country,
it's
a
relevant
market
area
and
you
determine
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
that
place.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
that
they
--
i
don't
think
they
intended
that
with
all
deference
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
they
made
it
very
clear
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
in
the
senate
report
saying
that
this
--
that
section
of
the
country
means
an
area
of
effective
competition
which
this
court
have
said.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
that's
right.
now
then,
it
can
affect
competition
--
the
market
shares
in
an
area
can
affect
competition
unless
that
area
is
one
of
effective
competition
in
which
the
market
shares
could
have
some
relationship
to
competition.
otherwise,
they
don't
have
that
the
--
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
in
philadelphia
bank
are
exactly
to
that
effect
based
upon
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no,
sir.
i
think
that
that
case
established
that
the
area
of
effective
competition
is
one
in
which
the
sellers
operate
and
where
the
buyers
can
turn
for
supplies,
can
turn
for
supplies
and
there
--
and
they
turn
for
supplies,
as
i
say,
applying
it
to
wisconsin
and
the
three-state
area,
to
an
area
much
farther
than
that.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
if
they
sold
95%
of
their
beer
in
the
state
of
wisconsin?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
they
would
say
then
that
the
relevant
market
area
is
where
they
operate.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
in
wisconsin,
where
they
operate.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
in
view
--
if
you
have
the
additional
facts
that
we
have
here
which
they
themselves
put
in
to
what
these
large
sales
--
shipments
going
out
and
the
substantial
shipments
going
in
and
the
proof
that
the
sellers
or
the
buyers
in
wisconsin
can
turn
to
others
for
supply
to
--
of
vast
area
of
the
state
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
they
are.
well
i've
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
thank
you,
your
honor.
before
the
recess,
mr.
justice
fortas
had
just
inquire
whether
if
i
thought
that
the
market
share
of
pabst
and
blatz
in
wisconsin
were
95%,
aggregated
95%
sales
that
would
make
it
a
relevant
market.
i
don't
think
it
would,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
don't
think
it
would
unless
it
was
otherwise
a
relevant
market.
as
a
matter
in
fact,
a
very
--
a
very
eminent
economist
have
said
that
without
first
establishing
a
relevant
market
area,
a
percentage
of
sales
have
become
whimsy,
i
think
he
said.
now,
why
is
that?
i
think
that
is
because
a
high
market
share
of
pabst
and
blatz
in
wisconsin,
if
wisconsin
is
not
a
relevant
market
area,
would
not
mean
that
pabst
and
blatz
could
control
price.
for
example,
let
us
for
a
moment,
consider
that
the
combined
pabst-blatz
sales
in
wisconsin
in
1961
where
less
than
9%
of
the
beer
produced
in
wisconsin
though
they
had
a
somewhat
higher
percentage,
24%
was
indicated,
of
the
amount
sold.
now
much
of
that
production
was
by
some
of
the
largest
breweries
in
the
nation
such
as
schlitz
and
miller
and
heilman.
each
of
whom
sold
a
great
deal
more
out
of
wisconsin
than
in
wisconsin,
although,
they
made
substantial
sales
thereto.
so
there
was
a
very
substantial
amount
of
beer
produced
in
wisconsin,
80%
of
which
was
shipped
out
of
the
state
leaving
pabst-blatz
sales
only
9%
of
beer
production.
the
huge
amount
of
beer
which
was
shipped
out
of
the
state
could
have
been
retained
anytime
in
the
state
to
control
any
effort
at
anticompetitive
pricing.
likewise,
brewers
in
the
state
or
out
of
the
state
were
shipping
in
25%
of
total
consumption
in
the
state,
yet,
they
had
a
large
sales
out
of
the
state
of
course
in
addition
if
the
wisconsin
price
became
anticompetitive
if
it
had
gotten
out
of
line.
they
could
have
diverted
a
very
large
amount
of
their
additional
production
into
the
state
at
the
--
at
a
more
attractive
price
if
it
was
lower
and
that
would
have
flooded
the
state
with
beer.
so
the
very
fact
that
those
additional
factors
must
be
considered,
the
very
fact
that
when
they
are
considered,
you
remove
any
possible
price
restraint
that
pabst
or
blatz
could
have
exercised
in
wisconsin,
shows
that
wisconsin
is
not
an
area
of
effective
competition
by
itself.
you've
got
to
consider
these
other
areas
as
well
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
they
have
25%
market
share
there
is
of
no
significance
or
the
fact
they
might
have
had
a
higher
market
share.
because
those
facts
that
are
in
the
evidence
are
rebutted,
any
inherently
anticompetitive
tendency
that
the
shares
might
show.
i
would
like
to
make
somewhat
more
specific.
the
comment
that
i
made
a
little
while
ago
in
response
to
the
argument
of
the
government
that
there's
a
proof
that
proximity
to
a
brewery
is
of
significance
in
the
sales
of
market
from
the
fact
that
a
brewery
was
--
that
blatz
started
to
increase
its
sales
in
california
after
they
started
making
beer
in
the
california
brewery.
that
is
not
conclusive.
there
is
no
explanation
of
it
in
this
record
and
i
point
--
mr.
justice
clark,
i
believe
you
commented
on
this.
i
point
to
the
fact
that
in
new
jersey,
blatz
began
to
be
produced
there
in
1959.
it
began
to
be
produced
in
pabst
plant
there.
in
1959,
their
sales
went
down
from
31,000
barrels
to
24,000
barrels.
and
in
1960,
up
to
29,000
barrels
below
the
‘59.
and
then
in
1961,
it
was
again
down
to
24,000
barrels.
in
new
york,
the
--
after
the
brewery
was
built,
the
barrels
produced
--
barrels
sold
in
new
york
were
71,000
in
1959,
74,000
in
1960
and
then
they
went
down
to
54,000
in
1961,
which
shows,
i
think,
that
the
mere
fact
that
beer
began
to
be
brewed
there
doesn't
necessarily
result
in
increase
in
sales
and
didn't
in
either
new
jersey
or
new
york.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
record,
pages
194
to
197
in
support
of
the
statements
which
i
have
just
made.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
i
will
proceed
to
do
that.
mr.
zimmerman
argued
that
judge
tehan
was
incorrect
in
refusing
to
consider
that
the
merger
occurred
in
an
industry
in
which
there
had
been
a
pronounced
trend
toward
concentration
in
the
national
market.
now,
the
fact
is
he
held
that
there
had
been
no
proof
of
a
trend
toward
concentration
in
the
national
market.
he
said
that
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
subject
and
the
only
reference
to
which
--
that
which
mr.
zimmerman
made
was
the
fact
that
the
number
of
brewers
in
united
states
deceased
from
750
in
1934
to
162
in
1961,
over
that
period
of
something
less
than
30
years.
now,
the
government's
complaint
alleged
that
the
reduction
in
numbers
was
due
to
“merger
consolidation
or
natural
attrition,”
that
was
the
allegation
of
the
complaint.
the
government
made
no
effort
to
prove
that
allegation
and
the
trial
court
merely
said
that
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
and
not
a
single
merger
or
acquisition
in
the
beer
industry
preceded
the
acquisition
of
blatz
by
pabst
and
that
the
decrease
in
the
number
of
breweries
resulted
from
the
play
of
natural
economic
forces,
that
is
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
in
support
of
that
allegation.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
yes,
sir.
in
the
opinion,
page
--
record,
page
of
448
is
where
he
starts
the
discussion
of
the
trend
toward
concentration,
448
and
he
goes
along
with
several
pages
discussing
it
at
some
length.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
that
connection,
first,
as
mr.
zimmerman
said,
the
national
market
shares
were
very,
very
small
and
in
fact,
a
total
of
a
little
over
4%
--
4.7%,
i
guess,
after
the
merger
of
national
beer
sales.
and
those
sales
were
--
that
percentage
of
national
sales
was
less
than
it
had
been
for
pabst
alone
in
1949
and
1952.
pabst
have
declined
substantially
in
the
intervening
period.
now,
with
that
in
mind,
let
us
consider
the
--
this
reduction
in
the
number
of
breweries
from
750
to
162
over
30
years.
now,
there
was
no
proof
that
any
of
this
reduction
was
due
to
mergers
and
during
that
period,
there
has
been
a
great
depression.
there
had
been
two
world
wars.
there
had
been
vast
changes
in
our
economy
including
the
development
of
rapid
transportation
from
coast
to
coast,
a
complete
revolution
in
packaging,
evidenced
in
this
industry
of
course,
by
the
convenience
packaging
of
cans
and
bottles
compared
to
barrels
and
nothing
different
from
other
industries
in
that
respect.
certainly,
over
this
long
period
of
time,
there
can
be
no
presumption
that
there
is
any
anticompetitive
significance
in
this
decline.
could
the
government
had
gone
--
couldn't
gone
back
to
the
civil
war
and
claim
that
there
was
some
presumption
that
a
decline
from
that
period
to
1958
resulted
in
some
kind
of
a
presumption,
i
suggest
that
it
could
not
have
done
so.
the
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
well,
the
--
as
i
started
to
say,
the
rate
of
decline
has
very
substantially
decreased
in
recent
years,
a
rate
of
decline
both
in
the
number
of
plants
and
also
in
the
number
of
breweries.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no
--
no,
in
that
result
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
no.
the
--
i
think
the
facts
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
but
it's
still
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
it's
still
--
they
still
have
a
--
or
had
in
1961,
162
breweries.
that
is
not
a
concentrated
industry.
and
in
1961,
there
was
no
one
that
had
as
much
as
10%.
it
is
not
a
concentrated
industry.
now,
i
say
when
the
rate
of
decline
is
substantially
leveling
off
as
have
happened
for
number
of
years
prior
to
1961
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
--
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
that
trend
--
that
that
reduction
in
the
number
of
breweries
in
that
trend
toward
fewer
and
fewer
breweries
is
gradually
coming
to
a
halt.
now
then,
as
i
--
i
don't
believe
i
have
stated,
we
haven't
agreed
cutoff
date
for
the
reception
of
evidence
at
the
trial
of
december
31,
1961.
this
trial
did
not
actually
take
place
as
i've
said
to
mr.
justice
harlan
until
january
1964.
but
by
agreement,
nothing
was
put
in
after
that.
we
had
nothing
for
‘63
and
‘62
wasn't
covered.
but
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
and
the
rate
of
decline
is
diminishing
very
greatly.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
top
10.
you're
talking
now
about
the
national
figures?
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
the
top
10
had
slightly
under
50%
in
1959,
49%,
yes,
right
after
50%
--
47%
to
49%.
the
--
it
is
not
an
industry
in
which
there
is
a
heavy
concentration
today
compared
to
many
industries
where
the
top
two
or
three
or
four
have
very
high
percentages
as
in
philadelphia
bank.
the
top
10,
that
percentage
is
not
high
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
top
25
have
more
than
1%.
you
can
go
through
down
there
before
you
got
a
brewery
with
less
than
1%.
now
then,
i
want
to
point
out
that
judge
tehan
didn't
say
that
concentration
is
irrelevant.
judge
tehan
said
that
the
evidence
is
not
proved
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
trend
toward
concentration
because
of
the
long
period
that
i
--
to
which
i
referred
to.
i
thank
you.
