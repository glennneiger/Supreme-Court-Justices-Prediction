it

what
years
were
those?
justice

that
wasn't

was
it?
justice
hugo

black
what
you
said
was,
wasn't
it
that
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
government
with
the
two
of
the
largest
strawberry
producers
in
florida
was
merging
contrary
to
the
antitrust
law,
do
you
think
the
court
could
deny
the
government
relief
simply
by
saying
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
florida
strawberries
are
not
sold
out
in
state
of
washington?
justice
hugo
l.

why
would
they
have
to
prove
something
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
something
that's
true
in
the
market.
justice
hugo
l.

but
now,
you
--
are
you
challenging
the
idea
that
it's
a
good
market
or
a
company,
local
of
such
things
that
the
local
people
want
to
eat?
why
isn't
that
pretty
good
evidence?
justice

well,
of
course
it
is
because
the
(inaudible)
was
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
can't
be
any
doubt,
is
it,
wisconsin,
parts
of
wisconsin,
parts
of
illinois,
and
parts
of
these
other
states
are
relevant
markets
underneath
the
--
were
coming
under
this
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
--
you
keep
saying
they
have
to
choose,
the
government
have
to
choose.
what
this
is,
is
whether
to
take
it
as
on
petition
and
if
the
evidence
shows
it,
suppose
the
government
made
a
mistake
and
said,
“here's
one
county
instead
of
another.”
does
that
make
any
difference?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
do
show
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
congress
intended
here,
didn't
it,
to
make
it
all
over
the
country,
any
place
for
goods
could
flow,
that
is
to
be
sold,
a
market
which
would
be
protected
against
mergers
which
they
condemn?
justice

which
would
substantially
affect
competition?
