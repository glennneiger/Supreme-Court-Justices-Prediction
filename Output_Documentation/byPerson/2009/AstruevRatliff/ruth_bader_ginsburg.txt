what
would
happen
in
the
case
--
in
case
it
is
a
prisoner
who
is
this
prevailing
party?
would
the
--
would
the
attorney
fee
be
paid
to
the
prisoner?
and
if
not,
to
whom
would
it
be
paid?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
the
agreement
between
the
party
and
the
attorney?
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
provides
that
fees
will
be
paid
to
the
prevailing
party.
where
does
the
prevailing
party
have
a
contract
with
the
attorney
to
turn
the
fees
over?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
pursuant
--
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
but
i
thought
you
said
that
there
is
a
contract
between
the
prevailing
party
and
the
attorney.
and
where
is
--
how
does
that
contract
come
about
if
it's
simply
a
case
that
the
lawyer
is
representing
pro
bono
a
plaintiff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
sounds
like
you're
--
you
have
--
the
client
has
an
agreement
to
pay
the
lawyer
or
the
client
has
paid
the
lawyer.
it
would
make
sense
if
the
client
has
paid
the
lawyer
and
then
there
is
reimbursement
under
eaja
that
what
--
what
you're
describing
would
make
sense
in
that
situation.
but
in
most
of
these
situations,
the
client
doesn't
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay
the
attorney
upfront,
of
course.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
does
that
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
award
goes
to
the
prevailing
party.
so,
therefore,
the
attorney's
fee
is
income
to
the
client--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
taxable
income
to
the
client?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like
pain
and
suffering,
but
that's
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then,
in
turn,
income
to
the
attorney
when
--
if
the
client--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
exchange
for
getting
25
percent
of
the
recovery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
understanding
is
that
the
ordinary
payment
to
the
lawyer
for
social
security
benefits
gained
for
the
client
is
25
percent
of
the
recovery
to
the
client
paid
directly
to
the
lawyer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that,
just
as
a
background
in
this
case,
did
ms.
ratliff
get
that
25
percent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
because
it
was
too
small
to
be
bothered
with?
what
was
the
reason?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
she
could
keep
only
one
from
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--she
could
keep
only
the
larger
of
the
two.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
difficulties
with
your
position
is
that
congress
did
exempt
a
number
of
federal
payments
from
the
offset,
but
it
didn't
exempt
equal
access
to
justice
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
what
percent
of
the
social
security
cases
where
the
claimant
prevails
is
there
an
eaja
fee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
there
was
no
offset
in
the
picture
because
the
government
wasn't
offsetting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
has
provided
in
some
statutes,
the
social
security
act
itself,
406,
that
you
quoted,
for
the
fee
to
be
paid
directly
to
the
attorney.
here
it
used
different
language;
it
said
pay
the
prevailing
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
that
be
in
this
case?
what
was
the
--
the
amount?
