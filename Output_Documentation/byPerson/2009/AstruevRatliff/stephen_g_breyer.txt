justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
way
for
the
lawyer
--
a
lawyer
sees
that
his
client
has
a
good
case
against
the
government,
and
thinks
he
can
get
an
eaga
fee,
so
he
says
to
the
client:
i'd
like
to
represent
you
and
i
can
get
paid
for
this.
but
the
client
says:
there
are
a
lot
of
debts
i
owe
the
government.
now,
is
there
any
way
they
can
work
it
out
so
he
can
get
the
representation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
the
lawyer
and
the
agency
and
the
client
sit
down,
and
the
lawyer
says:
here,
i
can
get
some
money
for
this
client
and
that
will
help
everybody,
but
i
want
to
be
paid.
so
i
want
you,
agency,
to
agree
that
on
the
repayment
schedule
if
i
get
an
eaga
fee,
then
i
get
to
keep
it
and
i
don't
have
to
give
it
to
my
client,
who
will
have
to
give
it
to
the
government.
and
then
they
can
sign
a
piece
of
paper
and
then
that's
done
and
the
lawyer
gets
to
keep
the
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
has
that
ever
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
could
now.
now
people
would
know
about,
and
they
could
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
first
one,
imagine
that
the
--
a
trust
owes
some
money
to
the
government.
now,
suppose
a
lawyer
representing
the
trust
recovers.
now,
they
recover
on
a
separate
debt,
okay?
separate
debt?
one.
that
money
goes
to
the
trust.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
trust
first
owes
--
the
trust
owes
$1,000
to
the
government.
the
trust
then
independently
recovers
$500
from
the
government
on
a
different
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
government
couldn't
offset
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
of
course
it
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
trust
is
not
a
person
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
payment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
payment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
$500.
the
trust
holds
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
can't
--
you
agree
that
that
couldn't
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
once
you
agree
that
that
couldn't
be,
i
think
you
are
in
trouble
on
your
first
argument.
i'm
not
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
similarly,
the
--
the
guy
--
the
client
here
receives
the
benefit
of
the
money
that
he
has
just
gotten
from
the
government,
including
the
attorney's
fees.
it
happens
that
he
can't
keep
those
attorney's
fees,
just
as
the
trust
can't
keep
the
$500.
he
has
to
give
the
attorney's
fees
to
the
lawyer,
just
as
the
trust
eventually
has
to
give
the
$500
to
the
beneficiary.
so
i'm
simply
saying
--
drawing
a
parallel,
which
--
go
on
to
the
next
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
is
it
different?
look.
this,
what
i
was
talking
about,
has
nothing
to
do
with
eaja.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
do
with
when
the
government's
allowed
to
offset
some
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
allowed
to
offset
some
money
when
the
money
is
money
that
it
would
otherwise
give
to
a
payee.
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
you've
defined
"payee"
as
a
person
who
has
some
beneficial
interest
in
that
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
think
that
the
client
here
has
no
more
and
no
less
beneficial
interest
whether
he's
a
person
or
whether
he's
a
trust.
that
was
my
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
your
earlier
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
imagine
that
if
joe
smith
is
in
a
lot
of
financial
trouble.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
his
house
is
being
foreclosed
on--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
his
bank
accounts
are
attached.
then
he
gets
some
money
from
the
government
and
--
including
an
eaja
fee.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
$5,000
of
money
and
1,000
for
the
fee.
they
put
it
in
his
bank
account.
it
was
attached,
good-bye,
nobody
sees
the
money,
because
it's
whoever
attached
it
got
the
money.
is
that
possible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
making
this
up.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
government.
i'm
saying
the
government
paid
him
5,000
plus
1,000
in
an
eaja
fee,
and
the
bank
got
all
the
money
because
it
had
attached
his
bank
account.
is
that
possible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
making
it
up.
no.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
i'm
just
making
up--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
follow
that.
those
are
the
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
a
year
later,
joe
smith
is
doing
much
better.
couldn't
the
attorney
now
sue
him
for
the
$1,000,
say
i'd
like
it?
it
went
to
the
bank
because
they
had
attached
the
bank
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
suppose
it
happened
to
be
that
that
6,000,
5
for
the
one
and
1
for
the
other,
came
from
social
security.
then
how
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
couldn't
take
1,000?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
couldn't
take
any
of
it.
because
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
in
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
eaja
fee
counts
as
a
social
security
benefit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
changed
it
and
said,
now,
how
does
it
matter
if
it's
social
security?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
win
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
no
one
can
attach?
no
one
can
--
no
one
get
the
eaja
fee
by
attaching
the
bank
account
of
the
client?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
skip
my
points.
they're
too
complicated.
[laughter]
