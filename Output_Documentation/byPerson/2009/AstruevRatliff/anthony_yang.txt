mr.
anthony
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
eaja
provides
that
in
an
appropriate
case
a
court
shall
award
to
a
prevailing
party
fees
and
other
expenses
incurred
by
that
party.
every
court
of
appeals
to
have
addressed
the
question,
including
the
court
below,
recognized
that
the
plain
meaning
of
eaja's
text
directs
payment
of
eaja
fees
and
other
expenses
to
the
prevailing
party,
and
not
her
attorneys.
moreover,
eaja's
relationship
to
the
fees
approved
under
section
406(b)
of
the
social
security
act
and
this
court's
decisions
in
jeff
d.
and
venegas
in
the
section
1988
fee
context
make
clear
that
congress
designed
eaja,
like
other
fee-shifting
statutes,
to
work
within
traditional
attorney-client
fee
relationships,
under
which
the
attorney
looks
to
the
client
for
payment.
congress
has
also
provided
that,
subject
to
exceptions
not
relevant
here,
all
funds
payable
to
the
--
by
the
united
states
to
an
individual
who
owes
a
valid
delinquent
debt,
federal
debt,
shall
be
reduced
by
administrative
offset.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
prevailing
party
in
this
case,
ms.
kills
ree,
owed
a
valid
delinquent
debt
to
the
united
states,
received
notice
of
that
debt,
had
the
opportunity
to
repay
that
debt
or
enter
into
a
repayment
agreement
that
would
have
avoided
offset,
failed
to
do
so.
congress
directed
in
the
debt
collection
improvement
act
of
1996
that
agencies
and
the
department
of
treasury
here
shall
offset
such
payments
for
delinquent
debts.
mr.
anthony
yang
that
is
true
in
part.
prior
to
2005,
the
treasury
department
did
not
yet
implement,
fully
implement,
the
debt
collection
improvement
act
with
respect
to
certain
payments.
here,
these
are
miscellaneous
payments.
treasury
undertook
the
very
large
undertaking
of
computerizing
the
system
to
provide
for
offsets
by
tackling
things
like
tax
refunds,
federal
benefits,
most
contractor
payments,
large
payment
systems
that
the
government
deals
with
on
a
day-to-day
basis,
and
only
in
2005
was
able
to
implement
miscellaneous
offsets.
since
2005,
the
government
has
been
offsetting
eaja
payments.
now,
in
some
circumstances
where
a
debt
is
owed
--
where
an
eaja
payment
is
made
and
a
court,
for
instance,
orders
the
government
to
pay
the
attorney,
the
government's
policy
is
to
check
whether
or
not
there
is
a
delinquent
debt
a
prevailing
party
owes,
and
if
not,
then
the
government
may
accept
the
assignment
or
comply
with
the--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
don't
believe
so.
there's
two
circumstances
where
--
that
we
might
be
talking
about.
the
first
circumstance
might
be
where
a
court
has
ordered
the
government
to
pay
the
attorney.
that
happens
in
a
number
of
cases.
when
the
government
does
not
have
a
debt
which
is
receivable
from
the
prevailing
party,
it
complies
with
the
district
court's
order.
it
simply
does
not
have
a
dog
in
that
fight.
when
we
have
an
assignment
that
the
government
recognizes,
that's
true
in
any
kind
of
context
where
you
might
have
an
assignment.
the
government
recognizes
the
assignment.
if
there
are
third-party
creditors
who
are
able
to
come
in,
they
may
come
in
and
contest
that.
they
likely
wouldn't
have
notice
of
it.
but
it's
no
different
than
any
other
assignment
that
the
government
might
accept,
from
a
party,
of
the
debt,
and
that
is
not
an
infrequent
event.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
lie
in
eaja.
courts
have
recognized
that
they
retain
equitable
authority
to
recognize
a
constructive
trust
or
an
equitable
lien
to
enforce
an
agreement
between
the
attorney
and
client
that
the
client
will
pay
over
to
an
attorney
funds
received
pursuant
to
an
award
such
as
eaja.
and
in
that
context,
although
courts
haven't
been
particularly
clear
in
their
reasoning
--
they
have
cited
to
equity
--
the
courts
have
provided
that
when,
for
instance,
an
attorney
represents
a
client
pro
bono
or
represents
a
prisoner
pro
bono,
that
the
court
will
see
to
it
that
the
payment
actually
received
doesn't
ultimately
land
in
the
hands
of
the
client
and
enforces
the
understanding,
either
expressed
or
implicit,
between
the
attorney
and
client
that
the
funds
that
the
client
receives
will
go
to
the
attorney.
mr.
anthony
yang
the
attorney
fee
under
eaja
is
payable
to
the
prevailing
party,
which
would
be
the
prisoner.
now,
attorneys
would
likely
come
in,
the
attorneys
for
the
prisoner,
and
ask
the
court
to
exercise
its
equitable
authority
to
recognize
a
constructive
trust
over
the
fees
that
are
actually
paid
to
the
party
and
prevent
the
party
from
keeping
that
money.
but
a
prisoner
is
ultimately
no
different
than
any
other
prevailing
party
under
eaja.
it
is
the
prevailing
party
to
whom
congress
has
directed
the
court
shall
award
fees
and
other
expenses.
mr.
anthony
yang
they
are
not
trumping
it,
your
honor.
the
--
there's
two
things
going
on
when
a
court
recognizes
an
equitable
trust.
first,
it
has
to
necessarily
recognize
the
right
of
the
prevailing
party
to
the
payment.
the
prevailing
party
obtains
the
payment,
and
only
once
the
prevailing
party
actually
has
title
to
the
thing
does
equitable
trust
or
a
constructive
trust
attach.
so
it's
recognizing
in
the
eaja
context
that
the
prevailing
party
is
the
one
who
is
entitled
to
the
fee,
but
then--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well--
mr.
anthony
yang
--correct.
mr.
anthony
yang
well--
mr.
anthony
yang
--in
order
to
recognize
the
agreement
between
the
party
and
the
attorney.
mr.
anthony
yang
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
as
this
court
recognized
in
venegas
in
the
section
1988
context,
it's
commonplace
either
for
there
to
be
an
expressed
or
an
implied
agreement
to
pay
over
any
statutory
award
that
the
prevailing
party
may
receive
to
the
attorney.
and
i
think,
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
otherwise,
courts
are
well
positioned
to
simply
say,
you
know,
if
they
haven't
agreed
otherwise,
the
normal
practice
would
be
for
a
prevailing
party,
if
they
were
to
receive
something
under
a
statutory
fee-shifting
provision
like
section
1988
or
like
eaja,
to
agree
to
pay
it
to
the
attorney.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
that
might
be
true
if
we
were
relying
on
a
common
law
offset.
but
in
this
context,
congress
has
directed
that
all
federal
payments,
unless
there
is
an
exception
--
and
there
is
no
exception
in
this
case
--
are
to
be
offset
before
payment,
any
payment,
to
the
debtor.
so
in
this
case,
congress
has
effectively
established
a
priority
scheme
whereby
when
a
debtor
owes
a
delinquent
valid
debt
to
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
owes
an
offsetting
obligation
to
that
individual,
congress
has
provided
that
no
federal
funds
shall
be
paid
to
the
individual
and
instead
that
the
debt
--
the
government's
debt
shall
be
offset
against
the
debt
that
the--
mr.
anthony
yang
--the
same
rule
would
apply.
no
federal
payment
would
--
well
--
i
believe
that
the
same
rule
would
apply.
i've
not
carefully
studied
the
bankruptcy
provisions,
and
i
hate
to
venture
into
a
very
complicated
area
to
give
you
something
definitive.
but
my
belief
is
that,
based
on
the
very
clear
text
of
section
3716
of
title
31,
which
was
amended
by
the
debt
collection
improvement
act,
that
no
payment
shall
be
--
even
in
bankruptcy,
the
payment
goes
to
the
--
has
to
go
to
the
debtor
first,
and
then
it
goes
to
the
estate
--
that
no
payment
shall
be
made
from
the
treasury
and
instead
an
administrative
offset
shall
be
undertaken
to
collect
the
government's
debt.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
sure.
there's--
mr.
anthony
yang
--as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
there's
several
things
that
can
be
done.
first,
the
attorney
can
determine
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
debt
which
is
eligible
for
offset,
and
that
can
be
done
by
asking
the
treasury
with
a
valid
privacy
act
waiver
from
the
client.
if
that
is
the
case,
the
client
retains
the
right,
which
congress
expressly
codified
in
section
3716,
the
right
to
enter
into
a
repayment
agreement.
if
that
is
done,
there
will
be
no
offset,
and
the
repayment
agreement
is
largely
governed
by
the
federal
claims
collections
standards,
which
are
codified
at
31
c.f.r.
900
to
904,
and
those
--
those
provisions
provide
in
section
901.8,
for
instance,
that
installments
shall
--
should
bear
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
size
of
the
debt
and
the
debtor's
ability
to
pay.
and
in
some
instances,
the
government
agency
is
able
to
compromise
that
debt
if
the
debtor
is
unable
to
repay
it
within
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
the
agency
should
consider
the
age,
health,
present
and
potential
income,
as
well
as
assets
of
the
debtor,
in
order
to
determine
the--
mr.
anthony
yang
--that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
anthony
yang
i
don't
know
that
that's
happened
in
this
offset
context.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
could
well
happen,
and
in
fact--
mr.
anthony
yang
--the
authority--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
the
statute
also
provides,
under
section
3711,
for
the
department
of
justice
and
the
department
of
treasury
to
establish
guidelines
for
agencies.
they
have
done
so
in
parts
901
to
--
or
900
to
904
of
title
31
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
the
statute
actually
reflects
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
because
at
section
3716
--
this
is
at
page
9a
of
the
government's
brief's
appendix
--
the
head
of
the
agency,
prior
to
implementing
an
administrative
offset
must
advise
--
this
is
on
a4
--
the
debtor
of
the
opportunity
to
make
a
written
agreement
with
the
head
of
the
agency
to
repay
the
amount
of
the
claim.
that
reflects
the
practice
in
the
federal
claims
collections
standards
of
agreeing
to
repayment
of
such
claims.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
i
think
the
hypothetical
was
premised
at
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit
rather
than
at
the
end.
if
--
if
the
case
were
at
the
end
and
the
government
were
ordered
to
pay
eaja
fees,
the
offset
would
be
automatic.
we
would
not
agree
at
that
point
to
split
the
--
the
offset
with
--
with
the
attorney.
but
in
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit,
when
the
attorney
is
undertaking
representation
of
the
client,
the
attorney
is
able
to
do
precisely
what
congress
intended,
which
was
to
have
debtors
come
to
the
united
states
and
take
--
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
repay
their
debts
to
avoid
an
offset.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
not
at
all.
the
government's
interest
in
an
installment
plan
is
not
motivated
by
eaja.
the
government's
interest
is--
mr.
anthony
yang
--this
is
a
separate
question,
which
is
whether
there
is
really
any
deterrent
or
how
large
the
deterrent
effect
would
be
having
the
specter
of
a
fee
offset.
and
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
this
court
in
underwood
explained
that,
because
eaja
awards
are
not
given
to
every
prevailing
party
and
are
only
given
to
parties
where
the
government's
position
is
not
substantially
justified,
it
is
--
one
cannot
reliably
determine
in
advance
whether
the
government's
position
is
going
to
be
so
unreasonable
that
you're
going
to
get
an
award
of
fees.
and
that
--
that
suggests
that
any
deterrent
effect
of
having
the
possibility
of
an
offsetting
--
an
offset
for
the
client's
debt
is
small.
and
that--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
may
have
misspoken--
mr.
anthony
yang
--let
me
back
up.
i
may
have
misspoken.
what
i
intended
to
convey
is
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
when
an
attorney
is
deciding
whether
to
represent
a
client,
the
case
has
not
been
litigated,
we
don't
know
whether
the
government's
position
is
going
to
be
found
to
be
substantially
unjustified
or
not,
the
attorney
--
if
the
attorney
checks
and
wants
to
determine
whether
the
client
has
a
--
a
debt
owed
to
the
government
that
would
be
subject
to
offset,
the
attorney
can
go
to
the
government
and
say:
let's
enter
into
a
repayment
plan
so
that
my
debtor
gets
on
the
government's
good
graces
and
no
longer
is
subject
to
have
a
tax
--
a
tax
return,
for
instance,
offset
or
any
other
payment
that
the
government
may
owe
to
that
debtor
in
the
future,
including
eaja.
but
it's
not
because
of
the
eaja
payment
that
you
would
enter
into
the
agreement.
the
government--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
i
guess
the
attorney
may
say,
i'm
about
to
sue
you,
but
the
government
certainly
is
not
motivated
because
of
the
lawsuit.
the
government
--
whether
an
attorney
is
going
to
sue
the
government
or
not,
the
question
is--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
i
guess
that
certainly
gets
our
attention.
but
the
reason
that
the
government
would
enter
into
a
repayment
agreement
is
because
that
is
an
opportunity
for
the
government
to
collect
a
debt
that
is
delinquent,
valid,
and
outstanding.
and
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
the
debt
collection
improvement
act
was
not
to
have
additional
federal
funds
be
paid
to
debtors
who
have
been
given
multiple
warnings
of
the
debt
and
are
essentially,
you
know--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
actually,
either--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
guess
a--
mr.
anthony
yang
--there's
a
few
answers--
mr.
anthony
yang
--there's
a
few
answers
to
that.
eaja
applies
not
only
in
the
social
security
context;
it
applies
in
all
civil
actions
in
which
--
not
sounding
in
tort,
in
which
there's
not
another
specific
fee
provision,
brought
--
brought
by
or
against
the
united
states.
congress
intended
--
and
this
is
in
the
statutory
findings
which
precede
eaja
in
section
--
i
believe
it's
202
of
the
act;
it
is
--
to
diminish
the
financial
deterrent
on
individuals,
businesses,
and
organizations
caused
by
the
expense
of
providing
--
of
litigating
a
case.
this
is--
mr.
anthony
yang
--that
may
be
true
in
the
social
security
context,
but
there
are
many
instances
in
which
--
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
normal
way
that,
you
know,
clients
and
--
and
--
and
their
--
their
attorneys
work
out
fee
arrangements.
sometimes
clients
will
pay
their
attorney
in
advance;
sometimes
they
will
pay
as
the
litigation
goes
forward.
and
by
the
time
you
have
the
eaja
award
the
client
will
have
paid
all
or
part
--
sometimes
none
--
but
all
or
part
of
the
--
of
the
fee
award.
mr.
anthony
yang
congress
directed
--
the
language
is
very
clear:
courts
shall
award
to
the
prevailing
party
fees
and
expenses--
mr.
anthony
yang
--incurred
by
the
party.
mr.
anthony
yang
i--
mr.
anthony
yang
--this
is
--
the
answer
to
that
is
complicated
and,
generally,
yes.
the
irs
is
of
the
view
that
attorney
fee
awards
to
prevailing
parties,
whether
it's
eaja
or
otherwise,
are
deemed
to
be
taxable
income
to
the
client.
now,
the
clients,
of
course,
will
have
an
offsetting
deduction
for
expenses
incurred
by
--
in
--
in
the
course
of
producing
or
collecting
income,
and
that
was
recognized
by
this
court's
opinion
in
banks.
that
deduction
is,
of
course,
subject
to
certain
limits.
it
has
to
be
in
excess
of
2
percent
of
the
adjusted
gross
income
and
subject
to
the
alternative
minimum
tax,
which
wouldn't
apply
to
social
security
claims.
but
the
general
answer
is
yes,
it
is
income
when
the
prevailing
party
receives
a
fee.
there
is
an
offsetting
deduction.
however,
there's
a
--
some
uncertainty
with
whether
some
fee
awards
when
the
underlying
benefit
obtained
is
not
taxable,
whether
that
--
the
irs
will
treat
such
payments
to
--
the
fee
awards,
as--
mr.
anthony
yang
--yes,
so,
but
also
certain
federal
benefits,
including
social
security
benefits,
have
a
very
complicated
tax
relationship.
social
security
benefits
are
taxable
in
part.
it
depends
on
the
size
and
the
amount
of
other
income.
so,
the
answer
is
actually
quite
complicated
whether
fees
are
taxable
under
eaja
in
the
social
security
context.
but
the
general
rule
is,
yes,
fee
awards
to
a
prevailing
party
are
income
and
subject
to--
mr.
anthony
yang
--correct.
just
as,
you
know,
when
i'm
--
you
know,
i
am
paid
my
salary
and
taxed
on
it,
and
then
when
i
pay
for
services,
the
person
to
whom
i
pay
also
has
income,
and
they
are
taxed
as
well.
this
is
not
an
unusual
situation.
mr.
anthony
yang
that's
correct.
if
the
government
never
had
an
eaja
award,
it
at
least
would
be
less
of
a
debt
that
it
could
collect.
mr.
anthony
yang
that's
correct.
the
government
is
--
ultimately
zeroes
out
here.
the
person
that
gets
the
benefit
is
the
prevailing
party,
because
the
prevailing
party
has
eliminated
a
debt
to
the
united
states
by
having
that
offset
by
the
eaja
award.
so
the
prevailing
party
obtains
the
benefit,
which
is
precisely
what
congress
intended
here.
mr.
anthony
yang
and
it
has
paid
its
eaja
award
by
offsetting
that
award
against
the
debt
that
the
business
owed
to
the
united
states.
the
government
is
--
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
balance
sheets
of
the
government
have
not
changed.
and
with
--
from
the
perspective
of--
mr.
anthony
yang
--from
the
perspective
of
the
prevailing
party
as
well.
the
prevailing
party
has
an
obligation
to
the
attorney.
those
are
the
attorney's
fees
incurred
which
have
not
yet
been
paid.
the
prevailing
party
also
has
an
obligation
to
the
government
in
the
--
in
the
amount
of
a
debt.
it
has
income
that
comes
in
through
the
--
through
the
fee
award,
and
whether
that
goes
to
offset
the
debt
to
the
government
or
offset
the
--
for
use
to
pay
the
attorney,
the
prevailing
party
ultimately
gets
the
benefit
of
that
fee
award.
and
the
government
has
paid
the
eaja
award
as
required
by
statute.
mr.
anthony
yang
we
don't,
and
the
reason
we
don't
is
because
each
agency
that
--
which
is
the
subject
of
an
eaja
order
submits
to
treasury
a
payment
request
based
on
that
order,
and
they
check
"miscellaneous
payment".
that
agency
doesn't
know
whether
that
payment
is
offset.
treasury
receives
that
--
that
request
of
payment
and
sees
that
it's
a
miscellaneous
payment,
checks
it
against
a
debt,
and
may
offset.
but
treasury
doesn't
know
that
the
miscellaneous
payment
was
an
eaja
award.
so
we
don't
have
any
statistics
that
we
can
point
to,
to
say
how
often
this
--
this
occurs.
i
can
say
that
the
financial
management
service
executes
one
--
over
one
billion
payments
per
year,
and
that
offsets
of
those
payments
account
for
$4.8
billion.
so
about
two-tenths
of
1
percent
of
payments
from
the
federal
government
result
in
offsets.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
anthony
yang
i
believe
i
heard
counsel
concede
that
eaja
fees
outside
of
the
social
security
context
are
payable
to
the
prevailing
party
and
therefore
subject
to
offset.
that's
true.
eaja
does
not
draw
a
distinction
between
social
security
fees
and
other
types
of
fees.
section
2412
uses
the
same
language,
court
shall
award
to
the
prevailing
party
fees
and
other
expenses.
i
believe
that
disposes
of
this
case.
second,
counsel
relies
on
a
definition
of
"representative
payee"
in
the
offset
regulations.
that's
addressed
at
reply
--
our
reply,
page
2,
footnote
1.
a
representative
payee
--
as
the
federal
register
provisions
that
relate
to
this
make
clear,
it
refers
to
things
like
attorneys,
it
refers
to
things
like
parents,
where
the
beneficial
interest
is
not
that
of
the
attorney
or
the
parent
but
the
client
and
the
child.
it
would
be
entirely
unworkable
if
any
time
that
a
payee
owes
some
debt
that
a
third
party
might
claim
an
interest
to,
that
the
government
would
have
to
find
out
the
payee's
finances
and
obligations
in
order
to
execute
an
offset.
it's
simply
not
the
way
the
offset
program
was
designed,
and
it's
not
reflected
in
the
regulation.
mr.
anthony
yang
(2).
mr.
anthony
yang
no.
section
206(b)
of
the
eaja,
which
is
reproduced
on
4a
of
our
appendix,
states
that
section
206(b)(2),
the
provision
you
were
talking
about,
shall
not
apply
with
respect
to
any
such
award,
meaning
any
award
under
eaja,
so
long
as
where
the
attorney
receives
fees,
the
smaller
fee
is
returned.
so--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
i
think
that
reflects
the
stakes
often,
your
honor.
oftentimes
the
government
does
not
contest,
for
instance,
a
$2,000
eaja
award
and
because
it's
the
government,
it
has
to--
mr.
anthony
yang
--no--
mr.
anthony
yang
--in
cases
--
in
the
va
context,
the
number
is
not
quite
that
large,
but
there's
a
substantial
number
of
cases
at
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it
was,
i
believe,
in
the
order
of
either
50
or
maybe
slightly
more
than
50
percent.
it
might
be
60.
but
the
number
is
substantial
that
you
get
a
reversal,
and
in
almost
all
of
those
cases,
eaja--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it
is
an
unfortunate
number,
your
honor.
and
it
is
--
it's
accurate.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
in
the
social
security
context,
eaja
awards
occur
not
only
--
excuse
me,
406(b)
awards
under
the
social
security
administration
do
not
apply
in
only
the
5
percent
of
the
cases
that
get
judgment
entered.
406(b)
provides
that
any
time
a
judgment
that
leads
to
an
award
of
benefits
is
made,
then
406(b)
fees
are
awarded.
so
even
if
in
cases
that
were
remanded
to
the
social
security
administration,
as
in
this
case,
you
could
get
406(b)
fees.
it's
just
a
question
of
the
timing.
you
have
to
do
so
after
a
remand
determines
the
amount
of
the
fee.
so
in
all
cases
in
which
a
claimant
ends
up
recovering
back
benefits
--
prevailing
and
recovering
back
benefits
as
a
result
of
a
successful
court
case,
that
attorney
is
entitled
to
payment
under
406(b)
pursuant
to
the
fee
agreement
with
the
client.
mr.
anthony
yang
that
is
not
in
the
record,
but
what
is
in
the
record
--
actually,
no,
this
is
not
in
the
record,
either.
but
the
court's
--
i
can
tell
you
that
the
district
court's
opinion
at
the
underlying
case,
pursuant
to
the
government's
concession,
awarded
--
determined
that
2
additional
months
of
benefits
would
be
paid.
