isn't
it
true
that
the
commissioner
of
social
security
in
the
past
paid
eaja
awards
directly
to
attorneys
and
that
this
is
still
done
in
cases
in
which
the
client
has
assigned
the
payment
to
an
attorney?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
gives
the
federal
government
the
right
to
override
state
law
on
that
issue?
suppose
the
situation
was
that
another
creditor
would
have
priority
over
the
attorney
if
the
money
had
been
paid
directly
to
the
claimant.
what
gives
the
government
the
right,
in
effect,
to
override
that
by
paying
the
money
directly
to
the
attorney,
unless
the
government
believes
that
this
is
payable
to
the
attorney
under
--
under
eaja?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
happen
to
know
how
much
the
--
the
treasury
typically
collects
in
a
year
under
these
eaja
offsets?
does
it
put
a
dent
in
the
federal
deficit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
this
argument
circular?
the
--
the
issue
is
who
is
--
to
whom
is
this
payment
to
be
made.
and
if
it's
to
be
made
to
the
--
the
claimant,
then
it's
not
for
the
beneficial
interest
of
the
--
of
the
attorney.
