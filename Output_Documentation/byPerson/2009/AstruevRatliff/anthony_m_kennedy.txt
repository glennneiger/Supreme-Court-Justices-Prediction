well,
what's
--
what's
the
authority
for
the
government
to
enter
into
the
agreement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
if
the
statute
says
there
has
to
be
an
offset,
that's
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
the
guidelines
reflect
justice
breyer's
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
the
underlying
assumption
--
and
some
of
the
question
would
have
been
put
to
you
by
the
court
--
is
that
the
government
has
somehow
benefited
because
the
money
is
created
to
offset
the
debt.
it
really
isn't.
it
would
--
this
would
be
true
if
an
attorney
were
suing
a
third
party
and
creating
a
fund,
and
the
government
said,
ah,
there's
the
money.
in
this
case,
it's
just
being
paid
from
one
account
to
the
other.
the
government
would
be
better
off
if
there
were
no
suit
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
just
paying
itself
from
one
account
to
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
having
trouble
with
this
aspect,
and
it
may
--
may
be
that
it
varies
from
state
to
state.
but
as
a
general
matter,
under
state
law,
let's
say
that
the
employee
makes
a
contingency
fee
arrangement
with
a
lawyer
to
sue
the
employer
and
wins
$50,000.
it's
a
one-third
contingent
fee.
the
--
the
employee
already
owes
the
employer
$40,000.
it
would
seem
to
me
under
the
general
principle
of
offset
that
the
employer
has
to
only
pay
$10,000,
and
the
attorney
is
not
going
to
get
his
full
fee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
just
--
that's
just
the
law
of
offsets.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
again,
it's
the
same
party.
if
they
created
money
by
suing
some
third
person,
then
that's
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
so
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
--
what
you're
asking
for
is
just
contrary
to
the
standard
law
of
offsets.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
even
worse
because
the
federal
statute
says
that
there
shall
be
this
offset
first
as
a
matter
of
priority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
the
generalized
sense
of
--
of
common
law
of
offsets,
as
i've
described
to
it,
sure,
the
attorney
has
a
beneficial
interest,
but
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
collect
it
vis-Ã -vis
the
employer
who
is
entitled
to
an
offset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
calculate
the
fee
under
either
the
social
security
act
or
eaja,
depending
on
the
case?
do
you
ever
calculate
it
under
both
so
that
you
get
some
under
each?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
--
you
calculate
it
under
both
so
you
get
some
under
each?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
