what
authority
does
a
court
have
to
direct
that
the
money
be
paid
to
the
attorney?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
government
setoff
depend
upon
who
owns
the
money
under
state
law?
i
mean,
it's
--
it's
commonplace
for
the
federal
law
to
look
to
state
law
on
issues
of
ownership.
and,
in
fact,
if
there
is
this
doctrine
of
equitable
ownership
on
the
part
of
the
attorney,
what
right
does
the
government
have
to
do
the
setoff?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
let's
take
the
regulation:
"a
person
who
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
all
or
part
of
the
payment.
"
ultimately,
isn't
it
the
plaintiff
who
has
recovered
that
is
entitled
to
the
benefit,
because
this
money
is
given
to
him
in
order
that
he
can
meet
a
financial
obligation
that
he
owes
to
the
lawyer?
i
mean,
if
this
didn't
exist,
he'd
owe
the
lawyer
and
have
to
pony
it
up
out
of
his
own
pocket,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
those
cases,
you
agree
the
offset
can
be
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
that
in
social
security
the
attorney
is
forbidden
to
accept
pay-as-you-go?
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
not
either
an
express
or
an
implied
contract
between
the
attorney
and
the
social
security
recipient.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
if
there
is
that
implied
contract,
then
it
is
an
obligation
of
the
recipient.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
how
that
leads
you
where
you
want
to
go.
then
the
payment
given
to
the
recipient
does
indeed
benefit
the
recipient
by
--
by
paying
off
an
obligation
that
the
social
security
recipient
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
--
i
thought
the
government
said
they
only
did
that
when
--
when
the
court
directed
that
it
be
paid
to
the
attorney.
