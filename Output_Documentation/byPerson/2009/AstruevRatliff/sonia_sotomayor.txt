could
you
tell
me
what
would
motivate
the
government
to
agree
to
give
to
a
lawyer
a
piece
of
a
recovery
that
it,
the
government,
thinks
it's
entitled
to?
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
to
work
a
repayment
plan.
that
starts
on
the
proposition
that
the
individual
can
only
each
week
or
month
or
whatever
give
a
certain
amount
of
money
over.
but
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
problem
with
your
argument
is
this
pot
of
money
is
actually
not
going
to
--
it's
going
to
the
debtor,
according
to
your
argument,
because
in
theory
the
debtor
is
the
prevailing
party
and
is
entitled
to
get
the
award.
but
the
money
is
not
being
paid
to
the
debtor.
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
lawyer
who
has
done
the
work
that
congress
wanted
done.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
what
the
--
i
don't
know
what
the
motivation
would
be
for
a
lawyer
to
undertake
to
represent
the
meritorious
claim
when
they
have
to
not
only
do
the
work
in
the
case,
but
now
have
to
do
the
work
for
the
government
in
getting
their
client
to
negotiate
an
agreement
with
the
government
on
something
that's
completely
unrelated
to
the
claim.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
--
it's
sort
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--illogical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--just
so
i'm
clarifying,
is
it
your
position
--
and
this
is
something
i
want
to
ask
the
government
as
well
--
that
once
the
eaja
fee
is
awarded,
the
attorney
couldn't
sue
the
client
later
even
in
an
offset
situation
for
repayment,
because
by
statute
you
view
them
as
blocked
from--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--from
seeking
anything
other
than
the
eaja
fee
or
the
406
fee?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
once
the
offset
happens,
the
attorney,
under
--
even
if
the
client
had
other
money,
the
attorney
would
be
blocked
from
going
after
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
they
can
only
seek
the
eaja
fee?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
either
the
eaja
fee
or
the
406
fee.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
is
your
adversary
correct
that
under
406(b)--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--(b)(2),
that
if
these
attorneys
--
if
any
attorney
attempts
to
collect
from
a
social
security
or
veterans
client
any
fees
outside
of
those
granted--
