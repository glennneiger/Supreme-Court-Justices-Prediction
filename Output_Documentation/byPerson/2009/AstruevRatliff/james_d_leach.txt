mr.
james
d.
leach
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
discuss
with
you
this
morning
four
reasons
why
catherine
ratliff,
and
not
the
government,
is
entitled
to
receive
the
fee
for
the
legal
services
she
performed,
that
congress
invited
her
to
perform,
to
show
that
the
government's
position
was
legally
erroneous
and
was
not
even
substantially
justified.
and
my
first
point
arises
from
your
question,
justice
scalia.
you
asked
whether
state
law
determines
who
has
the
priorities
here
in
terms
of
offset,
if
i
understood.
and
the
answer
is
that
actually
federal
law
determines
that,
specifically
the
debt
collection
improvement
act
and
regulations.
the
act
requires
mutuality
of
a
debt
between
the
debtor
and
the
government
before
the
government
can
offset.
and
the
regulations,
which
i'll
quote
in
just
an
instant,
require
that
before
offset
can
occur,
the
government
must
look
to
who
has
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
payment.
in
other
words,
who
is
entitled
to
benefit
from
it.
specifically,
31
c.f.r.
285.5(b),
which
is
quoted
at
page
45
of
the
red
brief,
defines,
quote,
"offset",
close
quote,
as
withholding
funds
to
satisfy
a
debt
owed
by
a
payee.
and
45
of
our
reply
brief,
as
"the
person
entitled"
--
as
the
person
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
all
or
part
of
a
payment.
in
other
words,
not
the
legal
title
holder
if
there
is
a
difference,
but
the
person
with
the
beneficial
interest.
mr.
james
d.
leach
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
benefit
--
true,
that's
a
benefit,
i
agree;
but
that's
not
a
benefit,
i
don't
think,
in
the
sense
of
who
--
because
the
question
is
who
has
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
fee
payment?
and
when
we
look
to
that
question,
because
that's
what's
at
issue
here,
is
the
fee
payment.
mr.
james
d.
leach
two
responses,
if
i
could,
justice
alito:
first,
the
word
"payment"
gets
thrown
around
a
lot
in
the
briefs.
it
can
mean
two
separate
things.
it
can
mean
who
receives
the
payment
first;
in
other
words,
who
is
the
check
mailed
to;
or
it
can
mean
who
the
check
is
ultimately
entitled
to
--
who
is
entitled
to
benefit
from
it.
and
the
government's
--
my
second
point
is
the
government's
reply
brief
at
page
10
to
12
concedes
that,
but
for
the
government's
alleged
right
to
offset,
the
attorney
does
indeed
have
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
attorney's
fee.
and
the
government
gives
three
reasons,
and
only
three
reasons,
why
its
alleged
right
to
offset
trumps
the
attorney's
beneficial
interest.
the
first
reason
the
government
gives
is
the
government
says
that
the
--
the
constructive
trust,
which
the
government
acknowledges
exists
in
the
--
in
--
in
favor
of
the
attorney
with
respect
to
the
fee
payment,
does
not
arise
until
the
instant
the
fee
reaches
the
client.
and
that's
true,
but
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
is
the
attorney
had
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
fee,
which
had
to
precede
the
moment
the
fee
reached
the
client,
if
it's
payable
to
the
client
in
the
sense
of
"sent
to".
the
beneficial
interest
had
to
precede
that
in
order
for
a
constructive
trust
to
arise.
the
government's
second
argument--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--if
--
i'm
not--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
of
course
it
could.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
well--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--if
i
understood
your
hypothetical,
if
the
trust
is
entitled
to
$500,
then
the
trust
i
think
would
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
payment.
mr.
james
d.
leach
i--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--well--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--okay.
i
don't
think
so,
because
if
we
are
talking
about
payments
to
persons,
you
know,
if
a
person
--
if
a
person
owes
a
debt
of
$10,000,
receives
$500
on
the
debt,
the
person
receives
the
benefit
of
that
$500.
mr.
james
d.
leach
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
leach
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
leach
that's--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--that's
true.
mr.
james
d.
leach
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
james
d.
leach
well,
your
honor,
with
what
i--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--actually,
your
honor,
the
federal
statute
provides
for
offset
in
accordance
with
regulations
to
be
issued
by
the
treasury
department.
and
those
treasury
department
regulations
were
what
i
quoted
right
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
we
have
to
look
at
who
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
payment,
not
the
benefit
in
a
generalized
sense
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
and
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
in
your
hypothetical
we're
talking
about
one
sum
of
money
that's
recovered
in
the
name
of
the
claimant.
in
this
situation,
we're
talking
about
a
statutory
fee
award,
which
is
created
only
based
on
the
work
of
the
attorney
and
which
is
labeled
an
attorney's
fee
and
separate
from
the
benefit--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
leach
and
my
point
about
the
statute
is
simply
that
the
statute
is
subject
to
the
regulation
which
looks
to
who's
entitled
to
benefit.
mr.
james
d.
leach
not
so,
your
honor,
in
social
security
cases,
which
this
is,
and
in
veterans
cases,
which
together
account
for
more
than
90
percent
of
all
eaja
awards.
in
social
security
cases,
42
u.s.c.
406(b)(2),
set
out
in
our
appendix,
makes
it
a
federal
crime
for
any
lawyer
to
charge,
receive,
demand,
or
collect
a
fee
payment
directly
from
a
client,
other
than
under
past
--
the
46
u.s.c.
406
past-due
benefits,
25
percent,
or
eaja.
and
this
is
a
critical
difference.
in
the
non-eaja,
in
the
non-social
security,
non-veterans
contexts,
you
know,
about
10
percent
of
cases,
you've
got
--
conceivably,
you've
got,
often,
clients
paying
lawyers
on
a
traditional
pay-as-you-go
basis.
but
in
a
social
security
case
or
a
veterans
case--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--absolutely.
absolutely.
the
difference
here
in
all
these
social
security
and
veterans
cases
is
that
the
attorney
is
barred
by
law
from
receiving
money
on
a
pay-as-you-go
basis.
so
the
attorney
has
never
been
paid.
mr.
james
d.
leach
no.
actually,
your
honor,
in
exchange
for
showing
in
federal
court,
if
i
understand
your
question.
i
hope
i
do.
mr.
james
d.
leach
that's
true.
mr.
james
d.
leach
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
25
percent
fee
here.
mr.
james
d.
leach
she
did
not
apply
for
a
25
percent
fee.
it
would
have
been
quite
small,
had
she
received
it.
it
would
have
been
much
smaller
than
the
eaja
fee.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
had
she
received
the
eaja
fee,
she
could
have
kept
it.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
and
the
--
there
are
two
points
there,
your
honor.
i
mean,
eaja
fees
--
i'm
not
claiming
all
eaja
fees
are
exempt.
as
i
just
said
--
spoke
with
you,
justice
scalia,
if
the
--
in
a
non-social
security,
non-veterans
case
where
the
client
has
paid
the
attorney
and
then
an
eaja
fee
comes
down,
that's
clearly
subject
to
offset.
you
have
to
look
to
that
regulation
and
who
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
fee
payment.
and
the
reason
that
the
debt
collection
improvement
act
doesn't
address
this
in
1996
is
that
in
1996,
the
government
had
never
taken
the
position
that
attorney
fees
were
subject
to
offset
in
social
security
or
veterans
cases.
and
in
fact,
in
1996,
there
were
three
court
of
appeals
decisions
on
the
question
of
whether
a
creditor
could
offset
a
statutory
fee
award:
plant
--
these
are
all
of
our
briefs
--
plant,
fourth
circuit,
1979;
duncan
--
i'm
sorry,
plant
is
fifth
circuit,
1979;
duncan,
fourth
circuit,
1989;
curtis,
eighth
circuit,
1993.
all
those
cases
said
that
the
creditor
may
not
offset
a
statutory
fee
award
against
the
creditor's
debt
because
the
fee
is
for
the
attorney.
that's
why
congress
couldn't
have
conceivably
thought
to
address
it
in
1996.
and
some
of
the
questions
take
me
toward
the
point
that
you
asked
about
before,
justice
roberts
--
chief
justice
roberts.
and
you
suggested,
or
you
said,
that
eaja
says:
pay
to
the
prevailing
party.
if
i
heard
you
correctly.
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
statute
is,
quote,
"award
to
the
prevailing
party.
"
"fees
and
other
expenses.
"
"incurred
by
that
party.
"
and
the
two
parts
that
we
haven't
really
addressed
yet
are
that
what
is
awarded
is
attorney's
fees.
and
this
"incurred
by"
language
--
with
respect
to
that
attorney's
fee
language,
"attorney's
fees"
has
a
traditional
meaning.
it's
a
meaning
this
court
has
recognized
in
all
those
cases
bullet-pointed
at
pages
19
to
21
of
our
briefs.
it's
a
fee
earned
by
and
paid
to
an
attorney.
and
in
gisbrecht
v.
barnhart
in
2002,
this
court
specifically
described
the
real
parties
in
interest
in
attorney's
fees
litigation
as
the
attorneys,
recognizing
the
reality
that
attorney
fees
go
to
attorneys.
in
addition,
the
language
"incurred
by
that
party"
--
what
does
it
mean
here?
well,
outside
of
eaja,
it
could
mean
--
it
does
mean,
i
think
--
money
the
client
takes
out
and
pays
to
the
attorney.
we
know
in
social
security
cases
and
veterans
cases
it
can't
mean
that,
because
that's
illegal.
that's
a
federal
crime
if
the
attorney
does
it.
so
what
does
it
mean?
well,
the
government
concedes
at
page
8
of
its
reply
brief
that
that
language
"incurred
by"
a
prevailing
party
is
supported
by
the
client's
implied
or
express
obligation
to
pay
the
attorney
the
fee
received.
so
this
is
where
the
government's
argument
is
circular,
i
think,
justice
alito,
in
the
sense
that
that
eaja
award
only
may
be
made
where
the
client
has
the
express
or
implied
obligation
to
pay
the
attorney.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
leach
i
agree.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
but
that
obligation
exists
only
to
the
extent
of
the
eaja
fee.
it's
not
a
separate
obligation.
the
attorney
can't
turn
around
and
go
against
the
client.
i
mean,
406(b)(2)
prohibits
the
attorney
going
against
the
client
for
any
fee
other
than
the
406(b)
fee,
which
is
separate,
if
there
is
a
406(b)
fee,
or
the
eaja
fee.
and
when--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--we
have
been
talking
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
that's
what
406(b)(2)
says,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
leach
they
can
only
seek
what?
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
and
we
have
been
talking
as
if
eaja
fees
and
406(b)
fees
are
sort
of
contemporaneous
in
every
case.
in
fact,
the
data
cited
at
page
14
of
the
red
brief
is
that
46
percent
of
federal
court
social
security
cases
result
in
a
remand.
only
5
percent
result
in
an
award
of
benefits.
so
there
are
going
to
be
far
more
eaja
fees
in
federal
court
than
there
ever
are
406(b)
fees.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
your
honor.
and
that's--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--no,
section
3
says
how
this
works,
of
the
--
of
eaja
1985.
it
says
if
there
are
two
fees,
the
attorney
keeps
the
larger
fee--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--and
sends
the
smaller
to
the
client
and
vice
versa.
and
that's
the
situation,
for
example,
where
you
could
have
an
offset
of
an
eaja
fee
in
a
social
security
case.
let's
say
there
is
a
406(b)
fee
that's
$6,000.
let's
say
there
is
an
eaja
fee
that
is
$4,000.
under
section
3,
that
--
the
attorney
doesn't
keep
that
$4,000.
that
$4,000
winds
up
in
the
client's
pocket.
the
government
can
offset
that.
that's
--
that's
what
integrates
all
this
discussion
we've
been
having
about
eaja
fees
not
being
exempt.
we
have
to
look
to
the
beneficial
interest.
mr.
james
d.
leach
forty-six
percent.
no,
that's
not
right.
it's
about
42
percent.
and
i
get
that
from
combining
two
numbers.
there
are
5,481
eaja
awards
per
year.
that's
red
brief
page
4.
and
there
are
about
13,000
social
security
civil
cases
per
year.
that's
green
brief
page
22.
fifty-four
--
13,000
divided
by
5,481
is
42
percent.
and
this
bring
me
to
the
point
the
government
was
making
in
suggesting
that
an
attorney
at
the
beginning
of
a
case
could
never
know
whether
or
not
there
--
there
is
going
to
be
an
eaja
fee,
because,
you
know,
you
can't
know
at
the
beginning,
they
argue,
what
position
the
government
will
take,
whether
or
not
the
government's
position
is
substantially
justified
or
not.
well
--
and
the
government
cites
pierce/underwood
from
1988
from
this
court,
in
which
this
court
said
exactly
that
--
pierce
v.
underwood.
pierce
v.
underwood
is
outside
the
social
security
context,
outside
the
veterans
context,
so
pierce
v.
underwood
is
in
this
less
than
10
percent
category
of
cases
under
eaja
which
are
not
social
security
or
veterans.
in
a
social
security
case
or
a
veterans
case,
the
attorney
has
the
record
before
proceeding
into
court,
before
deciding
whether
to
proceed
into
court.
and
the
attorney
can
look
at
that
record,
read
it,
and
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
whether
or
not
the
government
position
might
be
substantially
justified
or
not.
i
don't
ask
you
to
take
my
word
for
any
of
this.
let
me
tell
you
what
the
data
shows.
the
data,
justice
ginsburg
--
this
is
where
the
42
percent
of
federal
social
security
cases
result
in
an
eaja
award.
if
it's
42
percent,
that's
quite
a
high
number
of
cases
in
which
the
government's
position
is
found
substantially
--
not
substantially
justified
as
well
as
legally
erroneous.
in
veterans
cases,
it's
even
worse.
the
court
of
veterans
appeal
web
site
--
this
the
number
of
cases
--
all
together
--
number
of
dispositions
per
year
and
the
number
of
eaja
awards.
and
for
2008
and
2009,
if
you
add
up
the
numbers,
out
of
all
the
veterans
disability
cases
filed,
70
percent,
7-0,
result
in
an
eaja
award.
so
there's
quite
a
large
number
of
cases
in
which
--
in
--
in
a
veterans
context
or
social
security
context
where
the
government's
position
is
found
not
to
be--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
are
we
talking
about
the
government?
mr.
james
d.
leach
is
this
in
a
social
security--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
it
is.
sorry.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
i
think
so.
mr.
james
d.
leach
outside
the
social
security
context,
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
james
d.
leach
the
bank
could
not
take
it
because
of
the
anti-assignment
provision--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--couldn't
take
any
of
it
under--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--42
u.s.c.
407.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes,
42
u.s.c.
407
--
it's
cited,
if
it's
not
quoted
--
prohibits
assignment
of
social
security
benefits.
but,
justice
breyer,
if
i--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
we
were
outside
the
social
security
context.
mr.
james
d.
leach
if
it's
an
eaja
fee
in
a
social
security
context,
the
bank
cannot
take
that
because
of
the
federal
--
well,
because
the
attorney
--
the
government
admits
the
constructive
trust
exists
in
favor
of
the
attorney
with
respect
to
those
funds.
mr.
james
d.
leach
no.
the
government
says
--
has
said
that
in
its
reply
brief.
mr.
james
d.
leach
yes.
mr.
james
d.
leach
and
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
the
point
you
asked,
justice
breyer--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--well
--
but
during
--
during
mr.
yang's
argument,
you
asked
about
this
--
this
repayment
agreement.
the
concept
of
a
repayment
agreement
being
any
use
to
a
lawyer
who
is
thinking
about
taking
one
of
these
cases
is
fanciful
for
two
reasons:
number
one,
ssi
benefits
by
statute
are
limited
to,
quote,
"aged,
blind,
and
disabled
people
who
have
little
or
no
money.
"
so,
i
don't
know
where
the
disabled
or
blind
or
aged
person
is
going
to
get
the
money
to
enter
into
any
repayment
agreement.
but
the
second
reason
it's
fanciful
is
that
the
attorney
only
has
60
days
from
final
agency
action
to
file
the
case
in
federal
court.
and,
so,
there
is
60
days
to,
you
know,
meet
with
the
client
and
try
to
get
an
answer
out
of
the
government.
i've
never
tried
to
do
this
--
i
don't
know
anyone
who
has
--
but
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
get
much
of
an
answer
at
60
days
asking
the
government
to
do
this
so
the
attorney
can
then
recover
a
fee.
finally,
there's
--
there's
a
critical
point
here
that
i
need
to
get
to,
which
is
that
i
think
congress
has
told
us
exactly
what
this
language
means.
here's
why.
in
1985,
congress
enacts
eaja
and
uses
this
section
3
language
which
talks
about
who
gets
the
fee,
large
or
smaller
fee.
okay.
in
1992,
congress
extends
eaja
to
veterans
claims.
and
when
it
does
that,
in
38
u.s.c.
5904,
congress
uses
the
same
language,
down
to
the
exact
commas
in
the
same
place,
that
it
has
done
in
1985.
during
this
entire
period
--
and
here's
why
that's
important
--
during
that
entire
period
from
1985
to
1992,
and
indeed
continuing
many
years
after
that,
but
for
purposes
here,
1992,
the
administration
is
every
time
paying
the
attorney's
fee
to
the
attorney
under
eaja.
and
so
when
congress
in
1992
uses
the
same
language
for
veterans
eaja
claims
that
it
used
for
social
security
eaja
claims
7
years
earlier,
congress,
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
incorporating
the
settled
administrative
construction--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--mr.
yang
was
talking
about
from
2006
on.
from
1990
--
from
1985
to
2006,
every
eaja
fee
went
to
the
attorney.
mr.
james
d.
leach
two
responses,
your
honor:
the
offset
came
into
the
picture
in
1996,
but
the
government
says
it
wasn't
practical
to
2005.
even
if
you
grant
them
that
point,
the
agency
had
to
make
--
totally
apart
from
offset,
the
agency
had
to
decide
who
these
fees
should
be
paid
to
under
section
3
--
i
mean
under
eaja.
the
government
had
to
say,
who
does
this
statute
say
fees
should
be
paid
to?
now,
had
the
government
said,
well,
fees
go
to
the
client,
says,
you
know,
award
to
the
prevailing
party,
fees
and
other
expenses,
we
are
going
to
pay
attorney's
fees
to
clients,
which
had
never
happened.
but
had
the
government
said
that
--
that's
not
what
they
said.
they
look
at
the
statute.
they
look
at
the
fact
that
the
attorney
earned
the
fees,
and
they
say
we
are
going
to
pay
these
fees
to
the
attorney.
so
that's
what's
going
on
at
the
time
congress
in
1992
copies
its
1985
language--
mr.
james
d.
leach
--just
two
points,
justice
ginsburg:
number
one,
we
get
back
to
this
question
about
does
payment
mean
who
receives
the
check
or
who
is
entitled
to
benefit
from
it?
number
two,
eaja
doesn't
say
pay
to
the
party.
eaja
doesn't
use
the
phrase
406
says
payment
to
the
attorney.
eaja
doesn't
say
that,
"payment",
at
all.
the
only
place
you
find
eaja
is
where
it
says
the
government
cannot
be
required
to
pay
a
filing
fee.
there
is
this,
shall
award
to
a
prevailing
party
fees
and
other
expenses,
and
(d)(2)(a)
defines
"fees"
to
include
quote,
"attorney
fees",
close
quote.
i'm
finishing
my
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
leach
thank
you.
and
--
and
so
eaja.
mr.
james
d.
leach
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
