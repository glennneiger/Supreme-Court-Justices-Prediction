justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
petitioner
michael
astrue
is
united
states
commissioner
of
social
security.
respondent
catherine
ratliff
is
an
attorney
represented
her
client
in
a
successful
lawsuit
against
the
commission
for
social
security
benefits.
because
ratliff's
client
prevailed
under
claim
that
the
district
court
granted
the
unopposed
motion
ratliff
filed
for
award
of
attorney's
fees
under
section
204
(d)
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
or
eaja,
codified
at
28
u.s.c.,
section
2412
(d).
before
the
government
paid
the
fees
award
however,
it
discovered
that
ratliff's
client
owed
the
united
states
a
debt
that
predated
the
award.
accordingly
the
united
states
notified
that
district
court,
that
it
planned
to
exercise
its
statutory
authority
to
withhold
payment
of
the
fees
award
as
an
offset
against
that
debt.
ratliff
intervened
and
objected
to
the
proposed
offset
on
the
grounds
that
eaja
makes
an
attorney's
fee
award
payable
directly
to
the
prevailing
litigant's
attorney
and
thus
such
awards
cannot
be
offset
to
debts
owed
by
the
litigant
to
the
government.
the
district
court
rejected
this
argument,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
eaja
makes
the
attorney's
fees,
in
this
case,
payable
directly
to
ratliff,
the
attorney.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
party's
dispute
is
governed
by
section
24
(d)
(1)
(a)
of
eaja.
that
provision
states
in
pertinent
part
that
a
court
shall
award
to
a
prevailing
party
the
attorney's
fees
at
issue
here.
we
have
long
held
that
the
term
prevailing
party
in
attorney's
fees
statutes
is
a
legal
term
of
art
that
refers
to
the
prevailing
litigant
not
to
the
prevailing
litigant's
attorney.
we
conclude
that
the
term
carries
the
same
settled
meaning
in
section
2412
(d)
(1)
(a)
of
eaja.
we
base
this
conclusion
on
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
and
on
our
precedence
and
reject
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
ratliff's
arguments
that
the
court
of
appeals
contrary
judgment
is
supported
by
other
provisions
of
eaja
along
with
certain
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
and
the
government's
practice
of
paying
fees
awards
directly
to
attorneys
in
some
social
security
cases.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
