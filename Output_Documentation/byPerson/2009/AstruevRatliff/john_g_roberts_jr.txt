chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1322,
astrue
v.
ratliff.
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
can
the
court's
broad
equitable
authority
trump
what
you
say
is
what
the
statute
says?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
actually
have
to
transfer
it
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
mean,
the
statute
says
pay
the
prevailing
party.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you're
saying
the
court
can
say:
no,
pay
the
lawyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
certain--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if
the
client
is
bankrupt?
what
happens
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
a
fanciful
answer,
because
eaja
requires
that
the
government's
position,
to
get
fees,
is
substantially
unjustified.
and
so
the
government
lawyer
is
going
to
sit
down
and
say,
well,
you
know,
if
i
take
a
position
that
is
substantially
unjustified,
i
will
at
that
point
pay
the
fees
to
you,
not
to
the
client.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
the
attorney's
interest
--
i
thought
in
the
hypothetical
we
were
talking
about,
the
attorney's
interest
is.
he
thinks
the
government
is
going
to
take
a
substantially
unjustified
position,
and
he
wants
to
make
sure
in
that
case
that
he
gets
paid.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
going
to
look
awful
bad
to
a
court
that
comes
in
and
he's
--
and
the
court
is
asked
to
award
eaja
fees,
and
there
is
an
agreement
already
in
effect.
the
government
says,
well,
if
we're
--
you
know,
if
we're
liable
for
eaja
fees,
this
is
how
we
are
going
to
handle
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be
the
first
piece
of
--
that
would
be
the
first
piece
of
evidence
that
i
would
want
to
put
in
saying
i
should
get
eaja
fees.
the
government
thought
they
might
even
take
a
position
that
qualified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
say
he
goes
in
to
the
government
and
says,
look,
i'm
about
to
sue
you,
and
i'd
like
to
sit
down
and
negotiate
a
nice
agreement
about
the
repayment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
government
lawyers
are
always
sympathetic
to
people
who
come
in
and
say:
i'm
going
to
sue
you.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
government
zeroes
out,
but
in
the
course
of
it,
it
has
taken
a
legal
position
in
court
against
a
small
business
that
was
substantially
unjustified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
think
the
idea
--
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
leach.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
prevailing
party
gets
the
benefit
in
the
sense
that
she
is
relieved
of
the
debt
she
owed
to
the
government.
that's
a
real
benefit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
can
trusts
--
can
trusts
recover
eaja
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
don't
either.
i'm
looking
at
the
definition.
it
doesn't
say
"trust".
it
says
a
lot
of
other
things,
like
corporation,
association,
unit
of
government.
i
just
don't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
yang,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
you
--
do
you
dispute
your
friend's
statement
that
42
percent
of
the
time
in
social
security
cases
the
government's
position
is
unjustified,
and
70
percent
of
the
time
in
veterans
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
whenever
it
really
makes
a
difference--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--70
percent
of
the
time
the
government's
position
is
substantially
unjustified?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
number
would
you
accept?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
really
startling,
isn't
it?
in
litigating
with
veterans,
the
government
more
often
than
not
takes
a
position
that
is
substantially
unjustified?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-1322,
astrue
vs
ratliff.
