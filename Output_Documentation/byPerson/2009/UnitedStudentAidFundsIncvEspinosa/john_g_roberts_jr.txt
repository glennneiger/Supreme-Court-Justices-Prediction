we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-1134,
united
student
aid
funds
v.
espinosa.
ms.
wanslee.
chief

john
g.
roberts,

what
--
what
provision
was
this
discharge
under?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
1328
says:
"the
court
shall
grant
a
debtor
a
discharge.
"
that
doesn't
sound
self-executing
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
(a),
and
section
523(a)
does
not
refer
to
a
discharge
under
1328(a).
it
refers
to
a
discharge
under
1328(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
1328(a)(2)
brings
in
the
definition,
the
kind
of
debt
specified
in
523(a).
it
doesn't
bring
in
the
discharge
under
523(a),
which
is
limited
to
1328(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
--
if
you'd
like
to
reserve
time,
it's
probably
time
to
wrap
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
heytens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
--
sorry
to
start
--
stop
you
at
the
beginning,
but
i
don't
see
that.
i
see
in
1328(a)
it
says
the
court
"shall
grant"
the
debtor.
and
that
is
not
self-executing.
it's
a
directive
to
the
court.
and
i
see
that
523(a)
is
referred
to
later
on,
but
only
for
purposes
of
definition,
not
for
purposes
of
discharge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
the
key
distinction
you
draw
in
your
brief
is
totally
meaningless.
you
say
on
page
18
that
this
--
the
issue
is
whether
the
provision
is,
quote,
"framed
as
a
directive"
to
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
here
it
is
framed
as
a
directive
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
therefore
doesn't
--
isn't
self-executing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
meehan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
wanslee,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
--
my
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
it
does.
it
refers
back
to
523(a)
to
define
the
debt.
i
don't
think
it
incorporates
all
--
all
of
523.
it's
simply
referring
to
the
kind
of
debt
that
should
not
be
discharged.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-1134,
united
student
aid
funds
versus
espinoza.
