justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
was
wrong.
let's
assume--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
circuit
--
the
district
court
judge,
the
bankruptcy
court
judge,
got
it
wrong,
legal
error.
should
not
have
been
discharged,
a
given.
neither
--
the
confirmation
plan
should
not
have
been
approved,
neither
should
the
discharge
order
have
been
entered.
we
will
go
back
to
what
was
entered
and
--
and
--
and
the
effect
of
that,
because
i'm
not
sure
of
it
--
it's
an
error.
how
does
that
give
you
a
right
to
undo
that
judgment
7
years
later
--
was
it
5,
6,
7
years
later?
that's
the
question
here.
why
is
something
that's
in
error
become
a
void
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
so
does
--
most
error
committed
by
courts,
inadvertently
or
otherwise,
are
in
contravention
of
some
statutory
command.
this
is
no
different.
voidness,
as
i've
heard
it
described
by
many
others,
appears
to
mean
that
the
court
is
acting
either
without
jurisdiction
over
the
people,
and
that's
not
at
issue
here
--
there
was
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
here
--
or
without
jurisdiction
over
the
res.
but
the
bankruptcy
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
albeit
in
some
--
in
all
circumstances,
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
student
debt.
the
issue
is
what
could
it
do
with
it.
but
this
is
not
a
case
involving
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
by
the
court
over
property.
so
why
is
this
more
than
mere
error?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
--
that
goes
back
to
something
more
fundamental.
there's
no
issue
here
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
these
parties,
unlike
the
insurance
company.
and
there's
no
issue
that
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
this
res.
they
could
decide
that
a
student
loan
was
dischargeable.
they
just
had
to
follow
certain
procedures.
it's
a
very
different
set
of
circumstances
in
that
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
not
--
it's
not
that
it
is
not
dischargeable.
it's
only
dischargeable
under
certain
conditions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
--
so
you're
almost
begging
the
question,
because
it's
possible
to
argue
that
if
a
debt
is
not
dischargeable
at
all
under
any
circumstance,
your
argument
might
have
more
legs
because
then
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
over
that
property.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
not
the
case
with
these
exceptions.
they
can
all
be
discharged.
it's
just
a
matter
of
whether
the
conditions
have
been
met
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
may
i
interrupt
for
just
one
moment,
because
i
--
there
is
something
niggling
at
me
that
i
do
need
an
answer
to
before
you
sit
down--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
if
they
had
come
to
the
court
at
the
time
the
discharge
order
was
about
to
be
entered
and
said
we
object,
there
has
been
no
undue
hardship
found,
would
the
court
have
been
obligated
to
alter
the
plan
at
that
point?
the
confirmed
plan
proposed
a
discharge,
but
at
the
time
that
the
discharge
order
was
being
entered,
there's
an
objection.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
have
happened?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
the
question.
what's
final?
is
it
the
plan
that's
final
or
is
it
the
discharge
order
that's
final?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
--
but
here
we
have
a
discharge
order
that
on
its
face
appeared
to
be
proper.
it
excepted
out
the
student
loan
from
the
discharge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
your
other
--
the
other
side
has
sort
of
given
up
on
that
as
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
a
point,
because
that,
interestingly
enough
to
me,
would
have
been
the
stronger
due
process
argument,
whether
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court
could
have
amended
that
discharge
order
illegally
to
except
something
it
didn't
except,
that
was
--
shouldn't
have
been
excepted
to
start
with.
but
that
argument
seems
to
have
been
put
aside.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
so,
it
might
have
been
the
stronger
due
process
argument.
but
having
put
that
aside,
then
your
belief
is
that
there
is
no
point
in
time
between
the
confirmation
in
the
plan
and
the
discharge
order
in
which
a
party
can
object
for
--
to
an
error--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--except
as
permitted
by
60(b)
and
1330?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
order
could
they
have
--
they
could
not
have
appealed--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they
could
not
have
appealed
the
discharge
order?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
i
mean,
some
people
are
listed
in
discharge
orders
that
were
never
discussed
in
the
plan,
or
otherwise
some
people
are
excluded
that
should
have
been
included.
those
people
can't
appeal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
go
back
to
the
fundamental
part
of
my
question
to
your
adversary?
the
plan
order
included
a
discharge
of
the
student
interest
--
of
the
interest
on
the
student
loan.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
just
proposed
a
discharge
of
a
certain
amount
lesser
than
the
principal
plus
interest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
that's
the
plan.
and
then
you
have
a
discharge
order.
and
the
two
are
not
congruent.
so
what's
the
final
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
is
it
the
confirmation
order
or
is
it
the
discharge
order?
are
they
different
judgments?
what
--
what
controls?
and
what
were
you--
