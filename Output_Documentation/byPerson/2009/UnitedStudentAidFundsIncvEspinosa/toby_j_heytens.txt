mr.
toby
j.
heytens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1328
and
section
523
are
best
construed
as
self-executing
limitations
on
the
effect
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
discharge
order
rather
than
as
directives
to
the
bankruptcy
court.
there
are
two
reasons
for--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--two
responses
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
if
we
are
looking
just
at
the
language
of
1328,
which
is
reproduced
at
the
page
3
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief,
it
states,
as
the
chief
justice
notes,
that:
"the
court
shall
grant
the
debtor
a
discharge.
"
of
certain
debts.
there
is
then
a
comma,
and
it
says
"except
any
debt"
--
now,
i
can
see
that
that
language
is
subject
to
a
degree
of
ambiguity.
but
i
think
even
that
language
is
susceptible
to
being
read
as
a
legal
limitation
on
the
effect
of
the
discharge
order
that
the
provision
has
just
told
the
court
to
grant.
in
other
words,
the
reason
that--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
provision
before
the
comma
clearly
is
framed
as
a
directive
to
the
bankruptcy
court.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
language
after
the
comma
is
at
least
capable
of
being
read
consistent
with--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
i
am
referring
to
the
comma
in
--
in
1328(a),
the
last
comma
right
before
the
(1),
"except
any
debt".
and
the
reason
that
we
think
that
has
to
be
construed
as
a
limitation
on
the
scope
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
discharge
order
is
twofold.
first
and
foremost,
there
has
been
no
suggestion
whatsoever
that
there
is
a
different
rule
for
chapter
13
plans,
which
is
covered
by
1328,
than
there
is
for
chapter
7
bankruptcies,
chapter
11
bankruptcies,
or
chapter
12
bankruptcies.
but
the
consequences
of
saying
that
1328
alone
is
not
a
limitation,
that
is
the
consequence
that
that
would
have.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
justice--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
justice
breyer,
it
wouldn't
be
under
rule
60(b)(4),
because
if
you
understand
this
is
a
limitation
on
the
effect
of
the
discharge
order,
the
original
discharge
order
never
covers
it
in
the
first
place.
and
i
think
quite
the--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
justice
breyer,
there
are
three
very
specific
categories
of
somebodies
who
can't
do
that,
and
congress
has
specifically
identified
those
three
categories.
in
523(c),
congress
specifically
identified
three
categories
of
non-dischargeable
debt
for
which
the
onus
is
on
the
creditor
to
request
a
hearing
and
obtain
a
determination
by
the
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--that
is
true
with
regard
to
student
loan
debt,
justice--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--that
was--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--that
would
certainly
be
the
argument
that
would
be
made
in
future
cases,
if
the
court
were
to
accept
mr.
espinosa's
argument.
and
to
be
clear,
the
consequences
of
accepting
it
and
not
accepting
that
limitation
would
be
that
this
would
not
be
limited
to
student
loans.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
the
answer
is--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--with
the
exception
of
the
three
categories
in
(c),
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
breyer,
and
we
think
that
follows
straightforwardly
from
the--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
scalia,
we
discussed
page
--
523(c)
on
pages
13
to
14
of
our
brief.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
pages
13
and
14.
i
apologize,
justice
scalia.
the
language
of
523(c),
which
i
also
have,
i
can
read
it.
it
states
"the
debtor
shall
be
discharged
from
a
debt
of
a
kind
specified
in
paragraphs
(2),
(4),
or
(6)
of
subparagraph
(a).
"
"unless,
on
request
of
the
creditor
to
whom
such
debt
is
owed,
and
after
notice
and
a
hearing,
the
court
determines.
"
that
such
debt
is
to
be
excepted
under
(2),
(4),
or
(6).
so
for
those
three
categories
of
otherwise
non-dischargeable
debt,
congress
has
specifically
provided
that
the
onus
is
on
the
creditor
to--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--sure.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
with
--
with
one
caveat,
justice
stevens,
which
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
fight
the
hypothetical.
i
just
think
i
need
to
clarify.
the
creditor
can
certainly
stipulate
to
the
underlying
facts
that
the
debtor
alleges
in
support--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
stevens,
in
that
situation,
there
has
not
been
an
undue
hardship
determined--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
would
say
yes,
and
we
think
that
follows
naturally
from
this
court's
decision
in
hood,
where
the
court
clearly
described
523(8)(a)
as
a
self-executing
limitation.
the
court
specifically
said
it--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
ginsburg,
you
don't
necessarily
need
to
have
the
full
adversary
hearing.
what
you
have
to
have
is
what
congress
provided
for
in
523(a)(8).
you
have
to
have
an
undue
hardship
determination
that
is
made
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
now,
the
parties
can
stipulate
to
the
underlying
facts.
but
as
this
court
said
in
hood,
even
if
the
creditor
does
not
show
up
for
the
adversary
proceeding,
if
the
creditor
completely
defaults,
this
court
said,
on
pages
453
and
454
of
hood,
the
bankruptcy
court
still
cannot
discharge
that
debt--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
justice
stevens,
the
creditor
certainly
does
have
interests.
but
i
think
the
reason
congress
would
provide
for
this
regime
is
that
there
is
an
important
public
interest
at
stake
here,
too,
which
is
that
the
department
of
education
is
reinsuring
all
of
these
student
loans.
and
there
is
a
powerful
interest
in
ensuring
the
integrity
of
the
student
loan
system
as
a
whole,
that,
regardless
of
the
decisions
that
an
individual
debtor
and
perhaps
an
individual
creditor
are
willing
to
make
in
particular
cases,
congress
has
an
overriding
policy
that
student
loans
should
not
be
discharged
unless
there
is
a
determination
that
this
is
the
extraordinary
case,
rather
than
the
ordinary.
now,
there's
a
very
practical
reason
why
this
matters.
there
were
374,000
chapter
13
filings
last
year.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
standard
form
chapter
13
plan.
the
logical
consequences
of
affirming
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
in
this
case
is
to
tell
every
single
chapter
13
debtor
who
has
a
student
loan
debt
to
include
a
provision
like
this
in
his
plan,
in
the
hopes
that
the
creditor
will
not
object
and
he
will
be
able
to
obtain
a
discharge
in
the
absence
of
any
finding
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
it
won't
just
be
limited
to
chapter
13
debtors,
either.
it
will
apply
to
any
debtor
who
has
a
non-dischargeable--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
scalia--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
first
and
foremost,
justice
scalia,
the
ninth
circuit
has
specifically
forbidden
bankruptcy
courts
from
doing
that
on
pages
25a--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--they
--
the
department
of
education--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
it's
not
harmless,
justice
stevens
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer,
excuse
me
--
because
the
question
is:
who
does
it
make
sense
to
put
the
onus
on?
now,
to
your
question
--
the
bankruptcy
judges
can
do
it.
there
were
374,000
filings
last
year.
there
are
less
than
350
bankruptcy
judges
in
this
country.
that
means
more
than
1,000
chapter
13
plans
for
every
single
bankruptcy
judge
in
the
country.
the
idea
that
bankruptcy
judges
are
going
to
be
policing
every
single
chapter
13
plan,
it's
just
not
realistic,
and
i
don't--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
charade
hearing,
justice
kennedy.
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
normal
rules
of
civil
litigation
that
if
a
party
wishes
not
to
contest
a
factual
issue
in
a
properly
noticed
hearing,
they
can
make
that
choice.
thank
you.
