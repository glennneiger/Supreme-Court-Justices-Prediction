justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
strongest
case,
i
mean,
that
you
can
muster
in
favor
of
this
proposition,
my
question
being
the
same
as
justice
sotomayor's?
what's
the
strongest
case
where
you
can
find
any
court
that
said
a
matter
is
void
--
it's
void,
not
--
not
just
legal
error,
so
you
can
attack
it
90
years
later
--
it's
void
just
because
the
lower
court
that
made
the
error
didn't
apply
a
clear
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me
your
strongest
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'd
like
an
answer
to
my
question,
because
i
can
--
i
have
read
the
treatises,
which
i
have
in
front
of
me,
and
they
say
that
it's
void
only
if
you
show
a
--
the
same
thing
that
justice
sotomayor
just
said.
and
so,
since
i
don't
think
there
is
some
kind
of
constitutional
due
process
error
here,
and
there's
clearly
jurisdiction
over
the
parties,
i
guess
you
are
saying
there
wasn't
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
is
a
little
vague.
and
so
i
want
to
know
what's
the
clearest
case,
strongest
for
you,
where
a
court
has
ever
said
that
a
failure
of
some
--
of
some
other
court
to
apply
the
language
of
a
statute
properly,
no
matter
how
clear,
is
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
what
is
your
strongest
precedent?
that's
all
i'm
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
--
we're
conceding
that
they
violated
the
statute,
the
bankruptcy
judge.
the
question
is
whether
it's
void.
and
void,
as
you
just
said,
was
three
categories:
one,
was
there
a
violation
of
basic
due
process
for
your
client?
i
don't
see
it.
two,
did
the
bankruptcy
judge
have
jurisdiction
over
the
parties?
it
seems
the
answer
is
yes.
and,
three,
did
they
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
which
we
started
by
saying
was
vague.
so
i
asked
you
for
your
strongest
case.
you
said
vallely.
i
have
only
looked
at
it
quickly,
but
it's
only
four
pages.
and
what
that
case
seems
to
say
is
that
there
is
a
statute
which
says
there
is
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
over
all
commercial
businesses
except
for
insurance
companies
and
two
other
categories.
this
party
here
is
an
insurance
company,
and
therefore
they
can
attack
it
later,
because
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
an
insurance
company.
now,
if
that's
your
strongest
case,
i
don't
know
what
the
others
are
going
to
say,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
don't
have
much
precedental
support
to
put
this
in
a
category
of
lacking
jurisdiction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
consequence
of
--
there
happen
to
be
--
well,
i
counted
--
14
different
kinds
of
things
that
follow
that
comma,
including
criminal
fines,
sentences.
there
are
all
kinds
of
things.
and
is
it
the
consequence
of
my
accepting
your
argument
that
anybody
who
is
a
creditor
in
respect
to
any
of
those
14
things
can
come
in
at
any
time
and
announce
under
rule
60(b)(4),
even
if
it's
10
years
later,
that
the
district
court
--
the
bankruptcy
court
made
a
mistake?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
would
be
quite
--
to
me
--
extraordinary.
so
i
hope
the
answer
from
your
point
of
view
must
still
be
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait
a
moment.
what
would
it
be
in
the
case
where
you
have
a
discharge
order
and
it
says
things
in
it
which
somebody
feels
fall
within
1
of
these
13
categories?
now,
are
you
saying
that
that
somebody
can
come
back
and
make
his
argument
15
years
later,
because
he
will
say
that,
since
it
falls
in
that
category,
the
judgment
is
void
insofar
as
this
language
covers
what
i
don't
want
it
to
cover?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
you
see,
it's
the
same
problem
that's
bothering
us.
i
would
like
a
yes
or
no
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case
if
somebody
feels
the
conditions
were
not
met
with
in
the
13
categories
that
--
or
14
--
that
follow
the
comma,
he
--
you
feel
that
they
were
met.
the
other
side
says,
they
weren't
met.
i
sent
him
a
notice,
but
it
was
in
a
balloon,
okay.
you
know,
was
the
notice
a
real
notice,
wasn't
it?
people
argue
about
that.
so
in
any
case
where
you
have
a
person
who
says,
no,
they
weren't
met,
and
the
other
side
says,
yes,
they
were
met,
that
first
person
can
come
back
13
years
later
and
say
that
the
judgment
was
void?
is
the
answer
of
the
government
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
is
there
any--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
they
may
not
have
said
it
right,
but
they
--
but
they
--
that's
a
different
problem.
but
the
--
the
--
why
doesn't
the
treasury
just
say
to
people:
we're
not
going
to
insure
your
loans
where
you
don't
object.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
the
government
is
harmless.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
would
it
not
be
a
sanctionable
matter
under
rule
11?
if
--
the
lawyer
knows
that
he
is
supposed
to
make
this
special
claim
to
get
this
kind
of
discharge
--
he
knows
an
ordinary
claim
won't
do
it.
he
submits
a
paper
that
asks
for
the
ordinary
discharge,
but
he
has
to
sign
it,
and
that
sign
--
that
signature,
is
a
--
is
a
certification
that
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge,
the
claims
and
other
legal
contentions
are
warranted
by
existing
law.
so
if
he
signs
it
knowing
that
that
isn't
the
way
to
do
it
--
indeed,
there
is
not
even
an
argument
for
doing
it
that
way,
for
modifying
the
law
--
then
why
isn't
that
a
sanctionable
matter
under
rule
11?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
the
reason
i
ask
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reason
i
ask
that
is
i
think
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
it's
so
clear
in
the
law
that
this
is
not
the
way
to
go
about
it,
that
you
have
to
make
a
separate
piece
of
paper
saying
you
have
special
hardship;
that
that's
so
clear
what
congress
wanted,
that
40
years
later
you
can
come
back
and
attack
it,
if
they
didn't
do
it.
i
mean,
that's
basically,
in
my
mind,
their
argument.
but
i
think
a
simpler
way
would
be
to
say
if
it's
that
clear,
if
it
really
is
that
clear,
the
bar
itself
will
enforce
the
rule
by
not
knowingly
deviating
from
the
way
that
congress
set
it
out,
to
which
there
is
no
legal
objection.
now,
is
it
really
--
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wasn't
making
any
conditions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
--
that's
what
why
it's
a
--
this
is
actually
--
the
part
that
is
a
lack
of
understanding
or
a
complete
understanding
on
my
part,
is
--
is
how
rule
60(b)
works,
because
--
because
it
does-the
law
does
have
the
three
categories
--
the
three
categories
that
your
friend
described.
and
this
third
category
is
supposed
to
prevent
a
discharge
even
where
the
creditor
doesn't
object,
unless
certain
things
are
filled
out,
and
they
weren't.
so
the
three
are
there,
made
an
objection.
if
at
any
point
the
creditor
had
come
in
and
objected,
not
to
the
discharge
but,
you
know,
just
said,
hey,
it's
the
wrong
form;
you've
got
it
wrong.
it's
like
an
error-they
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
--
but
they
waited
a
very
long
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
they
have
to
come
in,
i
guess,
under
60(b),
and
it
must
be
either
60(b)(4)
or
60(b)(6)--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
take
it
there's
a
time
limit
on
that,
and
the
time
limit
is
"a
reasonable
time".
is
that
how
we
are
supposed
to
do,
that
we
have
to
say
they
didn't
file
--
if
fact
they
never
filed
60
--
it's
your
side
that
filed
the
60(b)(4),
i
gather.
so
this
is
good
and
mixed
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
good
and
mixed
up.
so
what
is
--
how
is
it
supposed
to
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
