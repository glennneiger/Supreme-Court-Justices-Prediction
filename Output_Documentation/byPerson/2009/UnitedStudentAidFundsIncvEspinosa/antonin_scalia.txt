justice
antonin
scalia
only
--
only
--
only
if
the
bankruptcy
court
disregards
the
law.
i
mean,
it's
--
it's
clear
that
the
bankruptcy
court
should
not
have
done
what
it
did
here.
the
only
issue
is,
it
having
made
that
mistake,
can
it
--
can
it
subsequently
be
--
be
undone
in
the
manner
that's
--
that's
sought
here?
they
haven't
reduced
three
to
two.
the
three
--
the
three
remain
three.
the
bankruptcy
court
should
not
do
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
commas.
what
comma
are
you
referring
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
(c)?
you
have
been
talking
about
523(c).
i
can't
find
it
in
any
of
the
materials.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
put
it
in
an
appendix
if
it's
going
to
be
part
of
your
case?
i've
got
to
search
through
your
brief
for
it?
what
page
in
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
bankruptcy
courts
read
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you've
got
to
assume
that
every
bankruptcy
court
is
going
to
violate
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
of
course,
they
are
supposed
to
police--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
acknowledge
that
what
the
bankruptcy
court
did
here
was
wrong?
do
you
acknowledge
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
and
it
should
not
have
done
it,
and
future
bankruptcy
courts
shouldn't
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
a
big
difference
to
how
i'm
going
to
look
on
this
case.
i
mean,
if
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
--
is
it
easy
for
a
bankruptcy
judge
to
identify
a
particular
debt
as
a
student
loan
debt?
i
mean,
would
the
bankruptcy
filing
--
filing
show
it
--
you
know,
student
loan
debt?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that's
not
enough
for
me,
that
it's
not
improper
for
him
to
do
it.
i
want
you
to
say
that
that
is
what
he
ought
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
not
willing
to
say
that.
you're
willing
to
say
that
bankruptcy
courts
can
do
that
if
they
like,
but,
you
know,
if
they
have
a
kid
that
has
a
lot
of
bankruptcy
debts,
he
has
a
soft
heart
for
student
loan
debts,
he
sees
this
as
a
student
loan
debt,
all
right,
let's
give
this
kid
a
break.
and
he
enters
--
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
say
it's
wrong
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
do
it
without
a
waiver,
and
--
but
you're
leaving
open
if
there
is
a
clear
waiver,
despite
the
fact
of
no
adversary
proceeding
--
you're
not
--
you're
not
necessarily
willing
to
say
that
the
bankruptcy
court
can't
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
the
price
of
your
winning
this
case,
it's
clearly
worth
it
now
--
agreeing
with
justice
breyer
on
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
mean,
if
indeed
the
court
would
not
be
willing
to
go
along
with
--
with
your
assertion
that
you
can't
undo
it
later,
once
it's
been
done,
unless
it
is
clear
that
it
should
not
be
done
and
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
shouldn't
do
it,
and
that
a
lawyer
shouldn't
propose
it
--
if
that's
the
condition,
then
you
should
accept
it,
right?
because
you
want
to
win
this
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
i
don't
understand
your
position,
because
i
thought
you
had
said
that
this
should
not
have
been
discharged
and
now
--
now
you've
answered
to
justice
ginsburg
that
so
long
as
the
--
as
the
creditor
appears
they
can
all
be
discharged.
now,
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
creditor
appears,
it
shouldn't
be
discharged.
i
thought
that
that's
what
you
had
said
before.
but
now
you
are
saying
that
so
long
as
a
creditor
appears,
all
of
these
are
dischargeable.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
it?
