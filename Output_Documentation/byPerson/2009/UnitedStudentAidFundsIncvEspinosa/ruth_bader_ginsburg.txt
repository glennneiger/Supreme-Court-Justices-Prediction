before
--
before
we
get
to
that,
the
ninth
circuit
did
say,
now,
bankruptcy
judges,
we
don't
want
you
to
--
to
intermeddle
in
this.
so
--
so
the
first
step
--
it
wasn't
clear
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
bankruptcy
judges
should
not
say,
now,
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
do
this
until
you
prove
hardship.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
a
--
can
a
creditor
say,
oh,
skip
it,
i
know
this
bankrupt
is
going
to
be
able
to
prove
hardship,
why
go
through
unnecessary
expense?
can
a
--
can
a
creditor
waive
the
hardship
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
he
can't
--
he
can't
stipulate
to
--
he
will
say:
i
want
the
deal
that
is
being
proposed;
i
think
i
am
better
off
getting
the
principal,
skipping
the
interest.
i
can't
make
that
deal?
we
have
to
go
through
this
hardship
procedure,
whether
the
creditor
wants
it
or
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
this
case.
the
creditor
was
there.
the
creditor
put
in
a
proof
of
claim.
the
creditor
knew
that
the
plan
gave
the
creditor
less
than
the
proof
of
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
--
why
should
it
be
void,
looking
at
1327?
we
have
a
confirmed
plan.
you-you
have
--
1328
does
include
--
except
523(a),
as
you
pointed
out.
but
1327
says
"effect
of
confirmation",
and
that
says,
"the
provisions
of
a
confirmed
plan.
"
--the
provision
here
is
you
get
13,000,
not
17,000
--
"bind
the
debtor
and
each
creditor,
whether
or
not
the
claim
of
such
creditor
is
provided
for
by
the
plan.
"
--which
it
wasn't
in
full
here
--
"and
whether
or
not
such
creditor
has
objected
to
or
has
accepted
or
rejected
the
plan.
"
that
seems
to
say
at
the
end
of
the
line,
you
get
that
final
determination
confirmed,
that's
it.
that's
as
final
as
you
come
and
whatever
mistakes
were
made
on
the
way
there,
you
can't
look
behind
at
the
confirmation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
to
go
through
an
adversary
hearing
with
full
notice,
and
every
--
and
nobody
wants
to
incur
that
expense.
this
is
a
bankruptcy.
you
are
trying
to
save
assets.
the
bankruptcy
judge
thinks
this
makes
no
sense.
the
creditor
says,
okay.
but
you
--
you
agree
with
your
colleague
that,
under
this
523
whatever,
you
must
have
the
full
adversary
hearing,
notice,
complaint,
the
works?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
the
only
debt.
this
--
there
was
no
other
debt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
i
take
it
that
you
do
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
when
they
said:
bankruptcy
judges,
don't
stand
in
the
middle
of
these
arrangements.
because
you
--
your
answer
was
you
think
the
bankruptcy
judge
does
have
the
obligation
to
bring
out
this
requirement
that
--
of
a
hardship
showing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
you
--
the
net
effect
of
this
is
if
you
have
taken
a
debt
that
is
non-dischargeable
and
put
it
into
the
category
that
it
is
dischargeable
unless
the
creditor
objects.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
code
puts
the
onus
on
the
debtor
to
raise
the
hardship
question.
your
reading
is,
even
if
the
debtor
is
silent,
totally
silent,
says
nothing
about
hardship,
unless
the
creditor
objects,
then
the
discharge
will
be
proper;
the
plan
can
be
confirmed.
so
you
are
taking
a
burden
that
congress
has
put
on
the
debtor
and
switching
it
to
the
creditor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
in
a
category
that's
labeled
"non-dischargeable".
there
were
other
items
in
that
--
that
category,
so
let's
take
it
that
--
the
child
support
arrears--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
debtor
says,
look,
i'll
pay
half
of
what
i
owe,
and
the
spouse
says,
i
need
something
for
the
children,
i'll
take
it.
and
then
the
plan
is
confirmed,
with
only
half
of
the
child
support;
and
then
the
caretaker
spouse
has
a
second
thought
and
says,
2
years
later,
i
need
that
money,
i'm
going
to
go
after
the
debtor
for
the
rest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
suppose
--
this
is
my
hypothetical.
it's
right
in
there,
and
the
--
the
creditor
haven't
gotten
all
the
notices
--
i
want
what
i
can
get
right
now.
so
i'll
make
this
deal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
are
supposed
to
be
additional
notices
here.
there's
supposed
to
be
a
summons
and
complaint
and
all
that.
and
let's
go
down
the
list
of
the
others.
how
about
taxes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
any
of
these
things
that
are
listed
as
non-dischargeable
can
become
dischargeable
unless
the
creditor--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--objects?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then,
why
do
we
have
this
third
category,
then?
nothing
is
nondischargeable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
answer
to
me
was
that
if
the
creditor
doesn't
object,
even
to
a
non-dischargeable
debt
--
if
the
creditor
doesn't
object,
it's
discharged.
that's
what
you
answered,
i
thought.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
child
support,
taxes,
or
student
loans,
right?
anything
in
the
category
--
you're
saying
the
creditor
must
object;
otherwise
it's
covered
by
the
discharge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
--
their
position
is
that
528(a)(8)
--
or
523(a)(8)
makes
this
--
it
puts
it
outside
the
discharge
order.
the
discharge
order
does
not
cover
this
kind
of
debt.
it
doesn't
discharge
student
--
student
loans
absent
a
hardship
determination.
so,
what
they
are
saying
is
the
discharge
discharged
other
things,
but
it
could
not
discharge
this
particular
debt,
so
it's
not
discharged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i'd
like
him
to
answer
the
question
that
i
asked
him
first.
