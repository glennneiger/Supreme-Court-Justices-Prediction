ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
precisely
delineated
three
types
of
debt
in
bankruptcy:
those
that
are
dischargeable,
those
that
are
dischargeable
unless
the
creditor
timely
objects,
and
those
debts
that
are
simply
not
dischargeable.
student
loans
fall
within
a
subset
of
this
third
category.
their
exception
from
discharge
is
self-executing
unless
a
debtor
proves
that
repayment
will
cause
an
undue
hardship
on
the
debtor
and
the
debtor's
dependents.
the
ninth
circuit
rewrote
bankruptcy
code
section
523
to
reduce
those
three
types
of
debt
down
to
two.
allowing
debtors
to
discharge
their
student
loan
debts
by
mere
declaration
opens
the
door
to
recategorizing
every
category
of
non-dischargeable
debt,
and
that
includes--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--your
honor,
this
case
turns
upon
the
effect
of
section
1328.
and
the--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
bankruptcy
courts
have
no
business
involving
themselves
in
this
dispute
if
the
creditor
fails
to
object.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
and
the
problem
here
is
that
1328
specifically
says
that
the
effect
of
the
discharge,
the
discharge
that
every
debtor
is
looking
for
in
a
chapter
13
case,
that
discharge
shall
not
include
non-dischargeable
debt.
and
the
language
is
very,
very
important,
your
honor.
it
prescribes
the
statutory
effect
of
the
discharge
order,
and
it
says
that
after
a
debtor
completes
their
payments
under
a
plan,
open
quote,
"the
court
shall
grant
the
debtor
a
discharge
of
all
debts
provided
for
by
the
plan,
except
any
debt
of
the
kind
specified
in
paragraph
8.
"
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
yes.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
justice
sotomayor,
it's
not
mere
error.
it's
in
fact
void
because
of
the
plain
language
of
these
particular
specific
statutes.
they
have
very
precise
words,
very
precise
meanings.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
because
congress's
statutory
scheme
must
be
enforced
as
written.
and
it's
--
it's
unequivocal
here
what
congress
wants.
congress
has
19
categories
of
debts
that
are
excepted
from
discharge,
important
exceptions:
alimony,
child
support--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--rule--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--your
honor,
rule
60
says
that
void
orders
can
be
attacked,
and
the
passage
of
time
does
not
transmute
a
void
order
into
a
valid
order.
once
void,
it--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--your
honor,
we
did
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
the
materials.
one
of
them
is
the
vallely
case,
in
which--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--that
was
the
insurance
company
case.
congress
said
that
insurance
companies
could
not
be
afforded
the
protections
of
bankruptcy.
and
in
that
case,
the
president
of
the
company,
the
secretary
of
the
company,
all
participated
in
the
bankruptcy.
but
the
court
found
that
the
bankruptcy
court
had
no
authority
to
--
to
issue
orders
and
to
have
that
insurance
company
within
the
bankruptcy
context.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
well,
your
honor,
if
--
if
this
order
is
merely
voidable,
then
why
do
we
have
section
523(c)?
523
--
a
very
specific
code
provision:
all
debts
not
included
in
523
are
as
a
matter
of
course
discharged
through
bankruptcy.
those
that
are
specifically
enumerated,
except
for
(2),
(4),
and
(6),
are
excepted
from
discharge
--
(2),
(4),
and
(6),
the
creditor
must
timely
file
objection.
why
do
we
have
that
scheme?
why
do
we
have
the
tripart
ordering?
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
no,
your
honor,
a
creditor
may
not
waive
the
undue
hardship
determination.
523
says
that
student
loans
are
only
discharged
upon
a
finding
of
undue
hardship.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
your
honor,
within
the
proper
context
of
an
adversary
proceeding
in
which
the
issue
has
in
fact
been
raised.
here,
there
was
never
any
--
any
allegation
of
undue
hardship,
never.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because,
once
again
523,
requires
a
finding--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--once
again,
i
--
i
think
you
go
back
to
the
language
of
1328,
your
honor.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
i
apologize.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
certainly
a
harder
case,
your
honor.
however,
i
don't--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--i
don't
think
--
there
would
not
have
been
an
adjudication
of
undue
hardship,
however.
just
because
the
debtor
stated
it
doesn't
mean
there
was
then--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--correct,
your
honor.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
no,
your
honor.
there
has
to
be--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--under
our
view,
the
creditor
is
entitled
to
the
protections
of
7001
to
say--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
undue
hardship
would
be
established
under
those
facts.
our
facts,
of
course,
are
a
little
bit
easier.
there
was
never
even
an
allegation
of
undue
hardship--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--much
less
proof.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
would
--
i
would
note--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--i
think
they
can,
your
honor.
and
i
think
we
can
look
to
this
court's
own
precedent
in
the
stoll
case.
the
stoll
case
said
that
it's
important
to
know
when
litigation
begins
and
when
it
ends.
and
usually
this
court's
opinions
talk
about
the
ending
of
litigation.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
beginning.
we
want
to
know--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--your
honor,
at
that
point
the
litigation
has
not
commenced.
there
is
no
summons,
there
is
no
service--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--okay.
and
a
proof
of
claim
is
merely
for
distribution
purposes
under
a
chapter
13
finding.
it's
not
for
discharge
purposes.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
it--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--your
honor,
in
your
case,
once
again,
we
--
we
do
believe
that
that
is
not
the
appropriate
constitutional
notice,
constitutional
practice.
notice
and
opportunity
are
just
but
one
part
of
access
and
due
process.
due
process
also
requires
compliance
with
whatever--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--congress--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--well,
your
honor,
the
exception
to
discharge
is
self-executing.
and
if
it's
self-executing,
how
can
we
waive
it?
if
there
is
no
duty
to
object--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--the
debtor's
discharge
was
entered
under
section
1328(a)(2).
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
well,
but
1328
further
goes
on
to
say:
"a
discharge
of
all
debts
provided
for
by
the
plan.
"
--as
this
debt
was
provided
for
by
the
plan
--
"except
any
debt
of
a
kind
specified
in
paragraph
8
of
section
523.
"
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
that's
correct,
your
honor.
1328(a)(2)
is
the
discharge
in
play
here,
and
1328(a)(2)
brings
in
the
discharge
provisions
of
523--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--it
brings
in
the
enumerated
debts
of
523.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
--
to
remember
that
back
in
1990
student
loan
debts
were
fully
dischargeable
in
chapter
13
plans.
in
1992,
when
this
plan
was
proposed,
mr.
espinosa
sought
to
claw
back
what
congress
had
taken
away
2
years
earlier--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--your
honor,
we
are
talking
about
a
statutory
right
here,
and
the
fact
that
congress
has
specifically
provided
that
certain
categories
of
debts,
for
very
important
public
policy
reasons,
are
carved
out
from
discharge.
and
the
reason
it's
void
is
because
it
violates
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
again,
even
if
it's
provided
for
by
the
plan,
the
discharge
this
debtor
got
under
1328--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time.
but,
justice
ginsburg,
to
answer
your
question,
1327
is
the
more
general
--
general
provision.
statutory
canons
provide
that
the
more
specific
shall
control.
but
there's
three
other
quick
reasons
i'd
like
to
give
you.
if
this
case
relies
just
on
1327,
it
deprives
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
rules
of
a
coherent
effect.
there
are
four
other
provisions
implicated:
1322,
1325,
1328,
and
523.
a
ruling
in
mr.
espinosa's
favor
undermines
the
will
of
congress
in
this
regard.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
thank
you.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
briefly,
just
on
this
last
point,
no
upset
whatsoever
to
bring
this
matter
back
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
espinosa
is
still
free
to
come
back
to
bankruptcy
court
and
argue
that
he
has
got
an
undue
hardship.
the
distributions
that
are
made
through
a
chapter
13
plan
are
a
matter
of
statutory
right,
every
single
adversary
--
every
single
plan
that
had
this
illegal
plan
language
could
come
back
and
it
would
not
upset
anything,
nothing
would
change,
no
distribution
whatsoever.
i
think
that's
an
important
point.
and
to
be
clear,
the
chief
judge's
--
chief
justice's
question,
523
by
its
terms
brings
in
1328(b),
which
is
a
different
kind
of
discharge.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
but
1328(a)(2)
specifically
then
incorporates
523.
it
is
applicable.
it
is
in
play.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
certainly,
1328(a)(2)
provides
the
laundry
list
of
exceptions
to
discharge.
and
that's
the
point,
is
that
student
loans
are
within
that
19
categories
of
debts
that
congress
said
are
excepted
from
discharge.
in
this
case,
there
was
really
no
basis
to
appeal
the
discharge
order.
it
was
proper.
it
was
appropriate.
it
excepted
the
student
loan
debt,
and
that's
found
at
page
46
of
the
record,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
what
happened
when
the
matter
was
on
its
limited
remand,
it
was
a
very
limited
remand,
and
this
issue
was
already
teed
up
with
the
ninth
circuit.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
it
did
not
so
specifically
state,
your
honor.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
it
had
a
predicate
of
discharge
of
interest,
no
predicate
of
undue
hardship.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
the
final
judgment,
your
honor,
is
the
effect
of
1328.
think
of
bankruptcy
as--
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
--the
controlling
order
here
is
the
discharge
order.
and
the
reason
why
is
because
bankruptcy
is
a
continuum
of
events
all
leading
to
the
discharge.
the
discharge
is
the
goal.
that's
what
the
debtor
wants.
but
only
congress
can
tell
a
debtor
what
he
gets
to
discharge.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
pardon
me?
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
well,
for
the
plan
itself,
from
the
plan
entry.
now,
once
again,
we
never
got
a
copy
of
the
plan
entry.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
well,
if
we
were
going
to
appeal
from
--
from
the
plan,
it
would
be
the
plan
or
--
but
there's
no
reason
to
appeal
from
the
plan,
because
once
again,
1328
excepts
our
debt
specifically
from
discharge
through
the
plan.
ms.
madeleine
c.
wanslee
thank
you,
your
honor.
