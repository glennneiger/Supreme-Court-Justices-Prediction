justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that,
a
debtor
in
chapter
13
proceeding
may
obtain
a
discharge
of
certain
student
loan
debts,
only
if
the
failure
to
discharge
that
debt
would
impose
an
undue
hardship
on
the
debtor
and
his
dependence.
according
to
the
federal
rules
of
bankruptcy
procedure,
the
bankruptcy
court
must
make
this
determination
of
undue
hardship
in
an
adversary
proceeding
which
the
parties
seeking
the
termination
must
initiate
by
filing
a
summons
and
complaint
on
those
who
could
be
adversely
affected
by
the
discharge.
francisco
espinoza,
the
debtor
in
this
case
filed
a
chapter
13
plan
with
the
bankruptcy
court
and
that
proposed
to
discharge
a
portion
of
his
student
loan
debt
but
he
failed
to
initiate
an
adversary
proceeding
to
determine
undue
hardship.
his
creditor
united
student
aid
funds
received
notice
of
his
plan
but
did
not
object
to
its
contents
or
espinoza's
failure
to
initiate
an
adversary
proceeding.
the
bankruptcy
court
confirmed
espinoza’s
plan
as
written
and
united
did
not
appeal.
years
later
united
filed
a
motion
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
60
(b)
(4),
asking
the
bankruptcy
court
to
declare
its
confirmation
order
void.
united
argued
that
the
order
was
void
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
it
was
premised
on
a
violation
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
rules,
specifically
the
bankruptcy
court's
failure
to
find
undue
hardship
in
an
adversary
proceeding
and
second
because
united’s
due
process
rights
were
violated
when
espinoza
failed
to
serve
united
with
the
required
summons
and
complaint.
the
bankruptcy
court
ruled
on
the
motion
and
parties
sought
review
in
the
district
court
and
ultimately
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
for
espinoza.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
the
bankruptcy
court's
order
confirming
espinoza's
plan
is
not
void
under
rule
60
(b)
(4),
the
rule
is
a
narrow
exception
to
finality
that
applies
only
in
rare
instance
in
which
a
judgment
is
premised
either
on
a
certain
type
of
jurisdictional
error
or
on
a
violation
of
due
process
that
deprives
the
party
of
notice
or
the
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
error
alleged
by
united
falls
in
neither
category.
united
does
not
argue
that
the
bankruptcy
court’s
error
was
jurisdictional
and
espinoza's
failure
to
serve
united
with
a
summons
and
complaint
did
not
violate
united's
due
process
rights
because
united
received
actual
notice
of
the
filing
and
contents
of
espinoza's
plan.
for
reasons
set
out
in
our
opinion
we
decline
to
expand
the
availability
of
relief
under
rule
60
(b)
(4),
to
cover
other
types
of
judgment
defects.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
