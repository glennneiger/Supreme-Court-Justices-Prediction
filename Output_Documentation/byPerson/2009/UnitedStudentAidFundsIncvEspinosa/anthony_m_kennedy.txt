justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
--
what
if
the
creditor
is
sitting
in
the
courtroom
and
has
actually
made
arguments
and
appeared
in
some
other
aspects
of
the
case?
then
they
come
to
the
student
loan
and
the
--
and
it's
ordered
discharged
without
any
hearing,
with
the
creditor
sitting
there.
the
case
goes
to
judgment,
there's
a
final
decree
of
discharge.
can
the
debtor
--
pardon
me.
can
the
creditor
come
in
10
years
later
and
say,
oh,
this
is
void?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
--
what
about
my
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
no,
no,
no.
my
hypothetical
is
there
is
--
it
has
commenced.
it's
a
big
hearing.
there's
lots
of
issues.
the
student
loan
creditor
is
there,
actually
participates
in
some
of
the
hearings
on
other
issues.
then,
while
they
--
while
they
are
still
there,
still
represented,
the
judge
says:
now,
i'm
going
to
discharge
the
student
debt;
i'm
not
going
to
have
any
hearing.
the
creditor
does
nothing.
can
the
creditor
come
in
10
years
later
and
say
this
is
a
void
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my
case
is
just
a
little
different
in
that
the
creditor
is
there
in
the
courtroom
represented.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
my--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
about
my
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
that's
an
astounding
--
an
astounding
conclusion,
that
there
--
that
you
simply
are
writing
out
the
doctrine
of
--
of
waiver
altogether.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
idea
that
they
have
to
have
a
charade
hearing
is
--
is
equally
off-putting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
hear.
proper--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
was
going
to
ask
whether
or
not
in
--
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
client
could
have
waited
until
the
final
judgment,
not
appeal,
but
then
come
in
under
rule
60?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
client
is
not
required
to
--
the
creditor
is
not
required
to
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
i
don't
think
they
could
have
--
and
of
course,
you
don't
think
it's
void.
it
could
come
in
under
60(b)
if
it's
void,
but
you
don't
think
it's
void.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
you
have
to
show
mistake
or
surprise,
and
you
doubt
that
there
was
a
mistake
or
surprise
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just
ask
this
and
maybe
i
have
bankruptcy
law
wrong.
my
--
my
understanding
is
that
if
creditors
are
not
listed,
they
are
not
discharged,
correct?
i
think
that's
right
in
most
cases.
if
you
don't
list
the
creditor,
the
creditor
is
not
discharged.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
if
you're
having
problems
with
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
just
wondering,
doesn't
it
happen
all
the
time
that
creditors
are
not
listed
and
then
they
come
in
later
and
say
the
debt
is
not
discharged?
i
mean,
doesn't
that
happen
all
the
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
--
is
the
rationale
that
that
--
that
that
discharge
would
be
void
as
to
them,
or
that
they
are
just
not
covered?
suppose
the
bankruptcy
judge
makes
a
mistake
and
lists
a
creditor
by
name
as
being
discharged,
but
that
creditor
never
received
notice.
is
it
void?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
this
--
is
this
case
all
that
different,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
got
notice
of
something
that
was
void.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that
--
that
--
that
assumes
that
he
got
notice
of
something
that
was
legally
improper.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
there
was
proper
notice.
there
was
not
a
notice
that
there
would
be
a
contested
hearing.
or
that
there
would
be
an
adversary
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
there
was
a
proper
notice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course
that's
the
problem
in
the
case.
sometimes
we
decide
cases
that
don't
make
a
lot
of
difference
and
that
once
we
decide
the
rule
everybody
will
know
what
the
rule
is.
but
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
say
that
if
we
adopt
the
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
adopted,
it's
going
to
be
extremely
burdensome
and
costly
on
--
on
municipalities,
on
--
on
those
who
give
student
loans,
et
cetera.
and
that
--
and
that
you
are
just
creating
a
tremendous
burden
on
an
already
overburdened
system.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
practicality
point,
you
talk
about
electronic
notice.
i
suppose
that
that
--
that
the
creditors
for
student
loans
could
have
the
automatic
electronic
thing
where
they
say,
we
insist
on
a
hardship
hearing.
but
that
doesn't
solve
the
problem,
because
they'd
then
have
to
go
back
and
see
whether
or
not
there
was
a
hardship
hearing
in
the
case.
so
that
--
that
means
they
have
--
they
have
--
they
have
to
--
they
have
to
inquire
into
every
case
whether
or
not
the
proper
hearing
has
been
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
you
mean
they
can't
ask
for
a
hearing
unless
there
is
a
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
there
is
no
undue
hardship
--
can't
even
ask?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
does
the
notice
of
--
the
time
for
a
notice
of
appeal
run
from?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
does
the
time
for
the
notice
of
appeal
run
from
--
the
discharge
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
--
now,
just
in
the
--
in
the
general
run
of
the
bankruptcy,
how
do
you
calculate
when
you
have
to
file
your
appeal
--
from
the
time
of
the
discharge
order?
