well,
would
the
case
be
different
if
there
had
been
such
an
allegation
in
the
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
have
been
different
then?
what
if
it
had
been
not
only
an
allegation
but
an
affidavit?
would
the
case
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
kind
of
curious
to
know
what
your
answer
to
my
question
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
case
be
different
if
the
petitioner
had
filed
an
affidavit
of
undue
hardship
with
the
papers?
same
notice,
everything
else
exactly
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
a
harder
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
say
it's
supported
by
an
affidavit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supported
by
--
would
then
the
case
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
has
to
be
an
adversary
hearing
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
so
if
there's
not
only
an
affidavit,
but
an
offer
of
proof,
and
then
there's
no
answer
filed
and
nothing
in
response
to
the
notice
of
the
--
the
lender
did
exactly
what
it
did
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
legal
theory
would
be
the
same
if
there
had
been
an
affidavit
filed
and
the
same
--
the
same
response
by
the
--
by
the
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
get
your
answer
to
a
similar
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
asked
your
colleague?
if
the
facts
of
this
case
were
changed
by
the
--
the
creditor
had
come
in
and
stipulated
to
the
plan
before
the
court
and
explained
at
the
time,
we
think
it
would
be
better
to
get
what
money's
available
now
rather
than
waiting
for
the
interest
to
be
collected
later
on,
if
they
had
stipulated
to
it,
and
then
the
order
was
entered,
you
would
still
say,
10
years
later,
they
could
charge
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
stipulates
to
the
entry
of
the
plan.
that's
all
he
stipulates
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
--
you
would
have
the
same
position
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
irony
of
your
position
is
it's
in
the
creditor's
interest
to
get
what
is
available
at
this
time,
rather
than
waiting
10
years
hoping
to
get
interest
later
on,
and
even
though
that's
the
fact,
you
cannot
give
relief
in
this
situation.
