justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
there's
no
objection?
the
bankruptcy
judge
sees
a
chapter
13
plan,
and
it
--
it
provides
for
the
discharge
of
student
debt;
it
covers
student
debt.
it's
labeled
"student
debt".
is
it
improper
for
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
say
you
can't
do
this
by
this
mechanism,
you
have
to
start
an
adversary
proceeding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
the
ninth
circuit
correct
in
saying
that
an
attorney
can't
be
sanctioned
under
the
bankruptcy
rules'
equivalent
version
of
rule
11,
for
attempting
to
sneak
through
a
discharge
of
student
debt
in
a
chapter
13
petition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
understand
that.
but
in
the
absence
of
circuit
--
controlling
circuit
precedent,
is
it
--
can
an
attorney
be
sanctioned
for
attempting
to
get
the
discharge
of
student
debt
through
a
chapter
13
petition,
knowing,
as
i
assume
every
bankruptcy
attorney
knows,
that
that
is
not
the
proper
way
to
attempt
to
get
discharge
of
a
student
debt
--
student
loan?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
am
not
interested
in
what
ninth
circuit
law
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i'm
asking
you
--
i'm
asking
you,
under
--
under
bankruptcy
rule
9011.
