mr.
michael
j.
meehan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
last
term,
in
travelers,
this
court
held
that,
if
the
plain
terms
of
a
confirmed
11
plan
unambiguously
apply
to
a
particular
issue,
they
are
entitled
to
their
effect.
that
is
this
case,
i
submit.
now,
the
case
did
go
on
to
acknowledge
that
there
can
be
some
situations
in
which
the
finality
is
not
going
to
be
found
--
it
said
subject
matter
per
se
is
not
one
of
those
--
but
that
if
the
court's
action
was
so
plainly
beyond
its
jurisdiction
as
to
be
a
manifest
abuse
of
authority
--
and
this
was
not
necessary
to
the
holding,
i
suppose,
but
it
was
described
in
kind
of
where
we
would
be
in
terms
of
exceptions
--
then
perhaps
finality
would
not
apply.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
acknowledge
that
it
did
violate
the
statute.
and
i
would--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
think
that--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
would
agree
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
reason
i
hesitate
is
this:
mr.
heytens
said
that
there
are,
on
average,
1,000
chapter
13
plans
filed
per
bankruptcy
judge
every
year.
the
bankruptcy
judges
do
and
are
entitled
to
have
creditors
make
objections.
indeed,
i
think
that
justice
stevens
was
right
that
if
a
creditor
and
a
debtor
wanted
to
come
in
and
stipulate
that
there
would
be
a
discharge
of
a
portion
of
the
student
loan
without
a
finding
of
undue
hardship,
then
certainly
they
can
do
so.
i
don't--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--as
far
as
i
know,
it
would.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
and
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
there
is
student
loan
debt
which
is
not
one
of
the
two
plans
that
are
guaranteed
by
the
department
of
education
because
congress--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--has
broadened
it,
so
that
may
be
the
case.
but
i
think
this
case
obviously
was
such
a
case.
and
i--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--it
was
the
only
debt,
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
if
i
used
the
word
"obligation",
perhaps
i
was
a
little
imprecise.
let
me
put
it
this
way:
number
one,
i
am
not
here
to
say,
nor
have
we
ever
said
at
any
stage
of
this
litigation,
that
this
plan
complied
with
523(a)(8).
that's
clear.
number
two,
if
there
had
been
any
objection
raised
whatsoever
at
any
time,
then
it
would
obviously
have
been
wrong
for
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
confirm
the
plan.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
do
not
think
it
is
improper
for
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
act
that
way,
because
under
section--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
do
not
think
--
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
improper.
i
think,
under
section
105
of
the
code,
indeed,
the
bankruptcy
court
has
what
i
would
analogize
as
sort
of
the
all
writs
act,
which
says
that
the
bankruptcy
court
may
act
sua
sponte
to
enforce--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--no,
i
balance
--
i
balance
your
question
against
justice
stevens's
hypothetical,
and
only
in
the
circumstance
where
it
is
clear
either
through
extensive
notice,
and
i
say
waiver
here,
or
through
an
actual
stipulation
--
only
in
those
circumstances
would
it
be
appropriate
for
a
bankruptcy
court
to
confirm
a
plan.
and
even
then,
i
submit,
under
section
105,
if
the
bankruptcy
court
said
i
will
not
do
so,
the
bankruptcy
court
need
not
do
so,
and
in
fact
--
in
fact,
the
bankruptcy
judge
here,
judge
hollowell,
when
she
denied
united
relief
under
rule
60,
said
that
she
as
a
bankruptcy
judge
would
not
have
done
so.
and
that
is
certainly
within
their
authority
to
do.
and
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--yes,
because
--
let
me
back
up
and
talk
perhaps
a
little
more
generally.
i
mean,
in
litigation
in
general,
parties
are
free
to
stipulate
away
or
to
decide
not
to
litigate
an
element
of
a
claim.
if
they,
in
fact,
do
that,
most
judges
would
say
that's
fine.
now,
in
this
instance,
again
--
and
i
don't
want
to
be
too
repetitious
--
but
in
this
instance,
the
bankruptcy
judge
does
have
that
extra
"well,
no",
i
read
this
as
being
something
that's
too
important
for
me
to
let
the
parties
stipulate
away.
that's
the
only
reason
that
i
don't
go
completely
with
your
hypothetical.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
justice
alito,
number
one,
we
don't
have
a
case
here
of
sneaking
through.
i
do
want
to
make
that
point.
this
was
clear
notice.
number
two,
i
think
the
bankruptcy
court
--
excuse
me,
the
ninth
circuit
was
not
wrong,
because
in
the
ninth
circuit,
there
was
binding
precedent,
the
pardee
case--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i'm
not
able
to
tell
you
as
a
matter
of
settled
ninth
circuit
law
that
that
is
or
is
not
the
case.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
then,
justice
alito,
i
thought
that
you
had
been
asking
me
under
ninth
circuit
law.
you're
saying
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--my
position
would
be
that
if
it
is
up
front,
clear
notice
--
in
effect,
a
proposal
that
we
just
don't
have
a
federal
case
out
of
an
undue
hardship
determination
for
$4,000
--
that
it
does
not
violate
rule
11
or
9011
to
make
that
proposal.
if
there
is
some
sort
of
lack
of
candor
or
if
there's
some
sort
of
weaseling,
one
might
say
perhaps.
and
i
think
it's
interesting
that
those
courts
which
have
said
that
this
is
not
something
that
bankruptcy
lawyers
should
do
have
not,
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
find,
invoked
rule
11
or
rule
9011.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
say
that
it
doesn't
shift
the
burden.
it
--
it
does
shift
the
going
forward,
i
suppose,
in
the
sense
of
making
an
objection.
but
let's
remember
that
this
is
something
that
would
obviously
have
been
reversed
on
appeal
had
the--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
am
not
here
to
say
absolutely
it
is
not,
justice
breyer.
what
i'm
saying,
i
think,
is
that
some
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
in
some
of
the
circuits
have
said,
at
least
without
invoking
rule
11,
that
it
--
that
it
is
improper.
others
have
not
had
that
difficulty.
i,
as
a
lawyer
who
has
litigated
for
39
years
and
is
very
conscious
of
rule
11,
have
never
thought
that
if
--
again,
if
it
was
something
that
was
plain
and
not
obfuscated,
that
a
proposal
to
simply
omit
one
element
of
a
claim
violated
rule
11.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
think
it's
debatable--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
think
that
--
i
think
that,
again,
in
the
context
of
what
this
case
--
the
issue
of
this
case,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
--
and
this
court
said
in
taylor
v.
freeland
&
kronz
that
we
are
not
going
to
adopt
a
rule
respecting
finality
that
is
going
to
take
on
the
onus
of
policing
the
bar,
and
noted
that
rule
in
criminal
bankruptcy
fraud
and
the
requirement
that
a
petition
be
signed
and
filed
on
a
verification.
and
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--you
mean
that
the
bar
may
have
further
scrutiny?
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
would
accept
--
i
would
accept--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
would--
[laughter]
i
would
accept
that
condition
on
direct
review
or
on
a
rule
60.
or
even--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
think
that
they
could
have.
rule
60,
as
it--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
they
take
the
risk,
justice
kennedy,
that
they
could
fit
within
60(a),
(b),
or
(c):
surprise,
inadvertence,
mistake,
excusable
neglect,
fraud,
et
cetera.
in
this
instance,
i
think
they
might
have
had
a
hard
time,
because
at
most
stage--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
void,
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
would
throw
us
into
the
due
process
issue
and
i
don't
think
so.
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
um--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
hesitate
because
rule
13
--
excuse
me,
section
1327
says
the
plan
is
binding
upon
creditors
whether
or
not
they
are
listed.
but
generally
speaking
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
think
that
does
happen
frequently.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
think
it
is.
i
do
think
it
is.
i
mean,
bottom
line,
about
the
only
thing,
i
submit--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
in
this
case,
the
creditor
got
fulsome
notice,
submitted
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
filed
a
proof
of
claim,
accepted--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--no,
i
may
be
misunderstanding
your
question.
he
was--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--but
not
void.
to
go
--
to
proceed
without
the
adversary
proceeding,
i
submit
is
not
void,
and
what
the
petitioners
had
to
try
to
do
is
to
ask
you
to
interpret
the
statute,
whether
it's
1328
or
523(a)(8),
to
make
this
some
sort
of
a
--
there's
no
way
you
can
touch
it;
if
you
didn't
do
the
adversary,
it
just
didn't
happen
kind
of
a
thing.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
justice
ginsburg,
the
child
support
or
domestic
support
has
a
number
of
additional
protections
surrounding
it.
number
one,
not
only
does
the
petitioner
for
chapter
13
have
to
notify
the
creditor
of
the
domestic
support
obligation,
but
under
section
1302,
the
trustee
has
to
do
so.
and
my--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--there
are
additional
notices
that
would
go
into
your
hypothetical,
and
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
in
this--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
i
think
that
the
principle
that
we
are
--
that
we
are
bringing
to
the
court
does
have
broad
application.
and
i
don't
want
to
--
i'd
like
to
come
back,
if
i
get
a
second,
to
the
domestic--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--if
the
creditor--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--does
not
object
and
if
the
court
does
not--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
may
i
submit,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
argument
proves
too
much,
and
that
is
to
say
that
if
one
can
wait
and
make
a
voidance
argument
under
rule
60(b)
6
years
after
the
discharge
and
12
years
after
the
filing
of
the
petition,
and
if
that
could
happen
to
anything,
then
what
we
have
is
that
we
may
as
well
just
worry
about
litigating
rule
60
motions
whenever
they
come
up.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
well,
justice--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--what
i
had
tried--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--the
position
that
i
had
tried
to
explain
--
and,
again,
i
think
it
balances
your
point
with
justice
stevens's
point
about
waiver
--
is
that:
should?
absolutely,
unless
there
is
an
affirmative
waiver.
but
let's
remember
that
when
we
talk
about
"should",
i
think
we're
talking
about
appellate
issues.
we're
talking
about
error
on
appeal.
we're
talking
about
what
ought
to
happen.
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
the
point
about
the
same
effect
occurring
for
taxes
and
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
proves
too
much,
is
that
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
none
of
those
is
finally
put
to
rest,
even
though
there
was
notice,
even
though
there
was
acceptance
of
benefits,
as
occurred
here,
even
though
there
was
a
submission
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
as
occurred
here
--
even
though
there
was,
you
know,
just
bypassing
the
early,
if
i
may
say
60
remedies
--
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
none
of
those--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
well,
my
position,
i
think,
first
is,
is
that,
as
i
think
justice
breyer
said,
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
clear
waiver,
and
i
think
the
court
could
rule
on
that
basis.
but,
number
two,
i
think
if
this
is
a
judgment
--
a
final
judgment,
proper
notice
--
we
do
not
have
a
due
process
concern,
we
do
not
have
a
notice
issue
--
and
the
creditor
has
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
--
to
raise
the
error--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--justice
kennedy,
i
think--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
think
you
must
look
at
it
this
way:
the
notice
that
was
given
was
for
the
confirmation
of
a
plan.
that
is
the
notice
then
that
is
required
under
the
bankruptcy
rules,
and
it
was
noticed
in
accordance
with
the
bankruptcy
rules.
is
it
right
to
do
it
in
a
bankruptcy
plan
confirmation?
if
objected
to,
no,
it's
not.
if
not
objected
to,
the
plan
says
what
the
plan
says,
and
the
notice
that
must
be
given
is
notice
of
the
plan--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
petitioner
and
its
amici
on
that
point,
i
think,
as
--
as
was
pointed
out
in
one
of
our
amicus
briefs,
overlooks
the
electronic
notice,
the
instantaneous
notice,
the
fact
that
under
federal
regulations,
which,
by
the
way,
do
also
require
the
guarantee
and
lenders
to
do
these
things
and
to
exercise
due
diligence
before
they
can
get
repaid--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--they
win.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
they
did.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
and
it
was
only--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--they
responded
with
a
60(b)(4).
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
well,
the
crux
of
it
is,
is
that
there
are
other
subparts
of
rule
60,
of
course,
as
--
as
we
all
know,
that
are
broader
potential
relief,
but
they
have
time
limits
on
them.
and
there
is
also
the--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--provision
in
section
1330
that
allows
revocation
for
fraud,
but
also
has
a
time
limit
upon
it.
but
rule
60(b)(4)
does
not
have
that
time
limit
on
it,
but
rule
60(b)(4),
which
is
the
only
basis
upon
which
petitioners
sought
relief
in
the
bankruptcy
court
--
and
they
made
that
very
clear
in
the
district
court
--
the
only
basis
would
be
if
it
is
void,
and
that
means
one
of
two
things:
number
one
is
the
due
process
issue,
which
we
haven't
spent
a
whole
lot
of
time
taking
about,
but
i
submit
is
clearly
not
viable
because
they
had
actual
notice,
and
this
court
has
held,
and
so
have--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--to
be
precise,
if
i
may,
1328(a)
says,
"the
discharge
shall
not"
and
then
defines
the
categories.
and
as
chief
justice
roberts
said--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--1328
is
the
operative
statute
for
the
discharge
of
a
chapter
13,
and
it
says
"shall
discharge"
except
for
those
categories
that
are
listed.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
there
is
some
significance
to
the
523,
which
says
"does
not
discharge".
but
as
--
as
the
chief
justice
observed,
that
applies
only
to
the
subpart
(b)'s
in
1328,
which
is
discharges
even
if
the
plan
has
not
been
fully
performed
by
the
debtor.
and
the
--
and
this
is
not
that
circumstance.
so
the
1328(b)
discharge
that
we
are
involved
with.
and
so,
justice
ginsburg,
i
--
i
think
your
question,
again,
comes
back
to
an
argument
of
law,
of
procedure
that
would
be
dealt
with
on
any
appeal
or
perhaps
on
the
--
on
the
more
expansive
subparts
of
rule
60
if
they
had
been
properly
brought.
but
i
do
not
see
--
i
have
always
had
a
hard
time
grappling
with
the
argument
that
somehow
the
fact
that
a
statutory
requirement
was
not
followed
falls
into
the
category
of
acting
so
plainly
beyond
the
court's
jurisdiction
that
its
action
was
a
manifest
abuse
of
discretion,
and
i
think
that's
what
you
would
have
to
conclude--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
justice
kennedy,
they
have
to
inquire,
in
any
event,
because
the
federal
regulations
require
them
to,
number
one,
determine
that
there
was
a
filing;
and,
number
two,
even
before
there
is
an
adversary
proceeding,
to
make
its
own
assessment,
the
lender
or
the
guarantee
--
the
guarantor
to
make
its
own
assessment
whether
it's
likely
that
there
would
be
an
undue
hardship
in
the
given
case,
and
there
are
other
circumstances
which
are
set
forth
in
the
--
in
an
amicus
brief--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--no,
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
--
is
that
i
submit
that
the
hardship
argument
is
a
little
bit
overblown
because
they
have
the
obligations
--
even
though
they
say
they
don't
have
even
an
obligation
to
open
the
envelope,
they
have
an
obligation
to
look
at
the
petition,
to
see
what
the
situation
is,
to
see
whether
there's
likely
an
undue
hardship.
they
don't
have
to
forbear
from
making
an
objection
to
a
plan
unless
they
have
a
basis
to
determine
that
there
was
undue
hardship--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--justice--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
the
result
would
not
change,
because
at
that
point
we
have
a
long
final
plan,
and
we
do
have
--
you
know,
the
issue
that
is
real
important
that
we
don't
spend
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
because
it's
sort
of
ingrained
in
us
is
finality.
there
are
chapter
13--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--it's
the
plan,
i
submit,
because
the
plan
is
what
determines
what's
going
to
happen.
the
discharge
is
like
giving
the
release
after
the
plan
has
been
fully--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--the
original--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--they
have.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
it
definitely
was
put
aside.
it
was
not
raised.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
well,
of
course--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well
--
and
as
permitted
by
just
simply
appealing
the
order.
they
could
have
done
that.
they
could
have
appealed.
they
could
have
done
60--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--the
confirmation
--
the
confirmation
--
the
--
the
order
confirming
the
plan.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
can't
answer
that
one.
i
don't
know
that
they
could
have
appealed
it.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
well,
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
they
cannot.
i
certainly,
if
i
were
representing
them,
would
try
--
try
it,
but
it's
just
something
that
i
have
not
seen,
and
in
working
up
this
case,
i
am
not
familiar
with
it,
but
it
may
very
well
be
an
appealable
order.
my
point
is
simply
that,
the
bottom
line,
we
have
something
here
that
is
very
final;
there
are
literally
billions
of
dollars
of
disbursements
made
by
chapter
13
trustees
in
reliance
on
the
these
plans;
and
it
would
be
very,
very
upsetting
to
the
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
exceedingly
upsetting,
to
make
a
very
broad
exception
to
finality.
