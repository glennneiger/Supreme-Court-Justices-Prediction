mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
basic
points
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
the
court
this
morning
with
regard
to
the
section
301
issue.
the
first
is
that,
in
our
view,
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
tort
claim
can
be
brought
under
301
begins
and
ends
with
the
clear
language
of
section
301,
which
talks
about
suits
for
violation
of
contract.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
allowing
the
tort
action,
as
granite
rock
is
urging,
would
work
a
big
change
in
the
structure
that
congress
has
established
by
which
it
has
decided
that
major
issues
of
labor
law,
such
as
the
weapons
--
economic
weapons
that
parties
can
use,
should
be
decided
by
congress
through
statute
and
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
through
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
that's,
of
course,
not
an
issue
in
this
case
because
it
was
never
attempted--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--the
law
in
most
of
the
circuits
is
that
any
case
which
involves
the
interpretation
of
a
contract
is
pre-empted.
i'm
not
sure
that
this
court
has--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--yes.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
no,
that
is
not
what
i
believe
happened.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
let
me
just
first
clarify
something,
that
the
preemption
of
state
torts
is
not
dependent
on
section
301.
state
torts
for
interference
with
contract
would
have
been
pre-empted
prior,
under
garmon
or
machinists
pre-emption,
because
of
those
two
doctrines,
that
it
would
interfere
with
conduct
that
is
arguably
prohibited
or
arguably
protected,
or
that
it
is
in
an
area
unregulated
by
congress.
but
it
doesn't
leave
the
employer
remediless
in
a
situation
like
this,
far
from
it.
this
employer
had
a
breach
of
contract
action
under
the
contract
that
it
is
pursuing--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--not
against
the
international.
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
no,
i
disagree.
there
is
an
avenue
that
granite
rock
could
have
pursued
but
did
not
pursue,
and
that
was
to
have
filed
a
charge
against
the
international
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
is
the
body
that
should
be
making
this
precise
decision
as
to
whether
this
action
by
the
international,
an
economic
weapon,
is
permissible
or
is
outlawed
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
granite
rock
chose
not
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
it
could
have.
and
we
cited
--
it's
cited,
actually,
in
the
amicus
brief
by
the
afl-cio,
the
paperworkers
case,
which
demonstrates
that
an
international
union
that
interferes
with
the
bargaining
of
local
unions
can
itself
be
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
i'm
not
--
i'm
sorry
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
answer
your
question,
as
i'm
--
as
i'm
understanding
it.
first,
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
bring
a
301
action
under
--
a
tort
action
under
301,
it
was
not
pre-empted
by
301.
the
question
is
whether
301
allows
that
type
of
claim
at
all,
whether
congress
intended
that,
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute,
violation
of
contract,
indicates
no,
because
a
violation
of
contract,
you
can
only
violate
a
contract
against
--
bring
an
action
against
someone
who--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--not
a
federal
court
claim
under
301.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
a
state
claim,
a
state
tort
action
under
301,
would
be
pre-empted.
what
will
happen
then
is
--
is
similar
to
what
happened
in
the-in
the
rawson
case.
what
happens
if
a
state
court
tort
is
brought?
it
would
be
pre-empted
because
of
complete
pre-emption
because
it
involves
a
contract
and
the
interpretation
of
a
contract.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
--
that
it's
gone.
what
the
federal
court
does
then
is
look
at
the
claim
and
say,
with
what
was
pled
in
the
complaint,
does
that
fall
within
the
parameters
of
301?
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
did
in
rawson.
it
said
the
state
court
tort
action
was
preempted.
now,
we
have
to
look
and
see,
is
there
a
claim
under
301?
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
yes,
but
we'd
be
in
exactly
the
same
position.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
yes,
you
would
get
to
the--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--you
would
get
to
the
same
result,
and
the
process
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
it
--
it
--
for
tortious
interference,
no,
you
cannot
--
you
cannot
bring
that
claim,
but
what
i
was
saying
before
is,
it
doesn't
leave
them
remediless,
even
with
regard
to
a
claim
against
the
international
because
a
charge
could
be
filed--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--under
8(b)(3),
and
the
board
would
decide,
the
--
the
conduct
in
this
context,
and
the
board
is
always
looking
at
the
context
of
it,
is
this
something
which
is
prohibited,
something
which
is
protected,
something
which
is
unregulated?
and
it
is
the
board
that
congress
entrusted
that
--
that
job
to.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
i
--
i
think
perhaps
we
are
saying
the
same
thing--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--let
me
try
because
i
think
i
understand
why
i
confused
you.
i
think,
before
301,
a
tort
action
would
have
been
pre-empted
by
either
the
doctrines
of
garmon
pre-emption
or
machinists
preemption.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
in
--
in
state
court.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
no
--
well,
no,
it
would
have
been
--
it
would
have
been
pre-empted
in
federal
court
also.
it
would
have
been
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
that's
where
--
who
it
goes
to.
what
i
think
has
happened,
justice
breyer,
is,
since
the
enactment
of
301,
and
particularly
with
this
court's
doctrine
of
complete
pre-emption
for
removal
purposes,
which
i
know
there's
some
debate
about,
when
courts
look
at
state
law
torts,
they
tend
to
look
at
301,
rather
than
going
back
to
garmon
and
machinists
pre-emption.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
yes.
it
would
be,
first,
a
cease-and-desist
order.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
and
then
a
make-whole
remedy.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
it
would
have
to
be
a
proof
of
damages
that
resulted
from
the
unfair
labor
practice,
from
the
unfair
conduct,
which,
in
this
situation,
would
have
been
the
interference
into
the
bargaining
process.
and
how
the
nlrb
would
decide
what
the
damages
would
be,
for
the
international
as
opposed
to
the
local
union,
i'm
really
not
sure,
but
there
is
certainly
the
capacity
under
the
nlra
for
there
to
be
a
make-whole
remedy.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
because
what
congress
--
what
congress
did
in
301
was
to
create
limited
jurisdiction
for
one
type
of
claim
and
one
type
of
claim
only,
violation
of
contract,
breach
of
contract,
an
action
against
the
party
that
has
the
obligations
under
it.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
isn't
any
claim
outside
of
301
against
a
third
party.
in
this
case,
the
third
party
is
the
international,
and
the
claim
could
be
made
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
paperworker
case
is
an
example.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
the
pre-emption
--
well,
in
this
case--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--well,
both
of
them
end
up
pre-empting
a
state
law
tort.
in
this
case--
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
--no,
it
pre-empts
exactly
for
the
purpose
that
this
is
an
issue
that
should
be
decided
by
the
regulatory
agency,
which
congress
entrusted
with
making
exactly
these
decisions.
what
economic
weapons
can
an
international
union,
can
a
parent
employer
use
in
a
labor
dispute?
for
the
courts
to
be
getting
involved
in
that
would
be
directly
contrary
to
what
congress
has
been
doing
since
1935,
of
saying
those
decisions
of
economic
weapons
are
not
to
be
decided
by
courts
applying
common
law
tort
principles.
we
tried
that,
and
we
didn't
like
it.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
it's
--
well,
again,
the
claim
that
they
brought
in
federal
court
was
not
preempted.
it
was
a
claim.
you
looked
at
the
claim.
you
read
the
complaint,
and
you
said,
you
don't
have
a
claim
under
301
because
it's
not
one
for
violation
of
contract,
good-bye.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
end
of
it.
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
was
--
was
addressing
to
me
was:
does
that
leave
them
without
any
remedy?
and
my
answer
is,
no,
it
doesn't.
aside
from
the
remedies
they
have
against
the
local,
they
also
had
a
potential
remedy
against
the
international
through
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
that
--
that
was
the
basic
point
that
i
was
making.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
the
paperworkers
case
that
we
cite
--
the
answer
to
your
question
is:
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case.
the
one
we
cited,
the
international
was
a
party
to
the
case.
however,
it's
clear
that
the
fact
that
it
was
a
party
to
the
case
was
not
the
determinative
factor,
because
what
the
nlrb
did
was
instruct
the
international
union
to
strike
the
pooled
voting
provision
that
was
in
the
constitution.
so
they
didn't
say:
it's
just
no
good
in
this
case
where
you
are
a
party
to
the
contract.
they
said:
you
can't
do
it
in
any
situation.
that
clearly
showed
that
the
--
that
the
nlrb
was
focusing
on
the
broader
type
of
interference
where
they
didn't
have
to
be
a
party
to
the
contract.
but
even
if
the
nlrb
--
and
i
want
to
stress
this
--
were
to
find
that
there
wasn't
a
remedy
under
the
--
the
facts
of
the
particular
case,
that
would
simply
mean
that
it
is
protected
conduct
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
the
nlrb
has
made
that
decision,
and
it
is
the
agency
that
should
be
doing
it,
rather
than
having
courts
get
involved
in
this
area
of
law
making
up
rules,
because
when
you
talk
about
interference,
as
we
know,
the
tort
isn't
for
all
interference;
it's
for
improper
interference.
as
the
associated
general
contractors
indicates,
that
would
call
into
play
the
courts
looking
at
various
factors
such
as
societal
values,
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
didn't
intend.
mr.
peter
d.
nussbaum
thank
you.
