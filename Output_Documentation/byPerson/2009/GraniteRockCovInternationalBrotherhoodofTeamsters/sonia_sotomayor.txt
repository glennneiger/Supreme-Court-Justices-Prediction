justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
not
arguing
us
creating
federal
common
law
for
tortious
interference.
you
are
saying
they're
the
actual
party
to
the
contract.
so
which
theory
are
you
--
are
you
arguing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you've
given
up
the
agency
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
that
issue
still
alive?
wasn't
there
an
nlrb
order
in
may
of
'06
that
said
--
or
directed
that
the
contract
become
effective
as
of
july
2nd?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
anybody
appeal
that
order
or
challenge
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
did
--
but
how
--
if
you
lost
in
your
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
contract
is
effective
july
2nd,
what
issue
remains
for
anybody
to
decide
with
respect
to
contract
formation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
there
has
been
a
final
adjudication
of
the
question
of
the
effective
date
of
the
contract.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
the
only
question
that
appears
to
be
extant
in
my
mind
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause.
so
why
isn't
that
subject
to
arbitration
by
the
very
terms
of
the
arbitration
clause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i
keep
going
back
to:
that
issue
was
decided.
it
was
decided
by
the
nlrb,
and
that
was
affirmed
by
a
court
of
law,
and
so
--
by
the
ninth
circuit.
i
don't
understand
what
the
extant
issue
is.
the
--
the
--
now
what's
left
is
applying
that
in
arbitration
to
the
question
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
no-strike
clause.
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
issue
of
ratification
has
been
decided
and
by
whom.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
you
answered
justice
alito
"no",
but
i
thought
his
question
was
a
very
simple
one.
you're
taking
the
position,
i
think,
that
there's
no
dispute
that
on
--
in
december
a
contract
was
formed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
was
made
retroactive
to
a
date
before
july.
it
started
in
may--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
it
covers
a
time
frame.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
dispute
between
the
parties
is
what
that
retroactivity
under
the
contract
means
and
which
provisions
are
in
effect
or
not.
isn't
that
what
your
argument
is
--
that
this
is
not
contract
formation;
this
is
a
question
of
--
of
the
applicability
of
individual
provisions
to
a
set
of
facts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
answer
to
justice
alito
should
have
been:
we
are
arguing
that
the
no-strike
clause
was
not
in
effect,
but
we
do
take
the
position
that
the
arbitration
clause
was--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--made
retroactive.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
remedies
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
seriously
think
that
if
that
becomes
a
problem,
that
the
nlrb
won't
declare
it
an
unfair
labor
practice,
or
if
they
don't,
that
they
won't
go
to
congress
and
say:
there
is
a
no-man's
land;
now
give
a
remedy
like
you
did
in
301?
you're
--
you're
begging
justice
breyer's
question,
which
is:
if
the
law
pre-empts
this
claim
and
it's
doing
so
unjustly,
who
should
make
that
determination?
should
it
be
you
in
a
state
court,
you
in
a
federal
court,
or
should
it
be
in
the
first
instance
the
nlrb
who
says
this
is
or
isn't
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
if
it
rules
it's
not
because
the
law
doesn't
cover
it,
or
it's
not
authorized
to
issue
this--
