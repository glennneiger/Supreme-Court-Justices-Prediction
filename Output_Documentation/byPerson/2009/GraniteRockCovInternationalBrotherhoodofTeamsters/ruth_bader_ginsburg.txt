but
why
is
there
--
is
there
anything,
any
question
about
formation,
given
that
there
is
a
contract?
the
contract
is
retroactive
to
may,
so
if
the
contract
is
retroactive
to
may,
then
certainly
a
contract
was
formed
and
that
issue
is
--
is
academic,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
why
does
it
matter?
why
does
it
matter
if
we
have
a
contract?
a
contract
has
been
formed;
everybody
agrees
about
that.
and
everybody
agrees
that
the
effective
date
is
may.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
contract
had
read,
not
simply
"claims
arising
under
this
contract",
but
in
addition
said
"including
the
formation
or
breach
thereof.
"
if
the
--
if
the
arbitration
clause
had
included
formation,
then
you
would
have
no
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
go
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
ruth
bader

i
thought
that
the
union's
initial
position
was
that
there
was
no
agreement,
and
it
refused
to
arbitrate.
isn't
that
what
--
wasn't
the
union's
refusal
to
arbitrate
what
precipitated
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
at
that
time
the
union
refused
to
arbitrate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
at
least
now
that
we
have
had
the
nlrb's
--
the
nlrb
has
weighed
in
and
said
that
there
was
a
contract
as
of
july
2nd,
why
isn't
that
conclusive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
perhaps
you
can
clarify
one
thing
for
me.
i
thought
that
these
two
go
together
--
two
things
that
go
together:
one
is
the
no-strike
clause,
and
one
is
the
arbitration
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
are
trying
to
uncouple
them,
and
so,
even
though
one
is
quid
pro
quo
for
the
other,
you
would
say
the
union
wants
to
keep
what
favors
it,
that
is
the
arbitration
clause,
but
reject
what
favors
the
employer,
that
is
the
no-strike
clause.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
one,
you
have
the
other,
but
you
can't
say,
oh,
yes,
we
have
the
arbitration
clause,
but
we
don't
have
the
nostrike
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it's
true
--
if
it's
true,
which
we
can
take
for
purposes
--
for
the
current
purpose,
that
the
international
really
did
induce
the
local
to
continue
the
strike,
you
said
there's
no
action
in
state
court
because
that's
preempted.
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
is
against
the
local,
not
the
--
not
the
international.
so
there's
nothing.
it
is
in
your
view,
you
--
you
said,
well,
there's
relief
against
the
local,
but
there's
no
remedy
at
all
against
the
international,
even
if
the
allegation
is
true
that
this
strike
would
never
have
occurred
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
pressure
from
the
international.
