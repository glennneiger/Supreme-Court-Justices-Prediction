mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
two
questions.
taking
them
in
the
order
that
the
ninth
circuit
addressed
them,
we
look
first
at
whether
the
complaint
contained
sufficient
facts
to
support
a
cause
of
action
against
a
non-signatory
international
union
that
engages
in
a
company-wide
strike
that
violates
the
no-strike
clause
of
a
contract
between
the
local
and
the
employer.
this
is
not
a
strike
for
higher
wages,
better
benefits;
it's
a
strike
for
an
amendment
to
the
contract
that
would
provide
immunity
for
the
international
and
other
locals
with
regard
to
past
wrongdoing.
the--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--it
is
a
tort
action
by
being
structured
as
inducement
and
interference.
it
is
grounded
in
contract.
specifically,
what
you
would
look
for,
for
jurisdiction,
is
to--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--your
honor,
301(a)
provides
jurisdiction
if
there's
a
suit
for
a
breach
--
if
there's
a
suit
for
violation
of
a
contract,
and
that
can
be
between
a
nonparty
and
a
party,
and
then
the
contract
is
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
mr.
chief
justice,
the
concept
that
we
are
advancing
is
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
violation
of
a
contract
is
right
at
the
heart
of
this
suit.
you
have
for
150
years,
jurisprudence
where
in
enforcing
contracts,
which
is
the
central
mission
of
the
statute,
there--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--i
can't
imagine
how
you
would.
you
might
have
a
different--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--kind
of
tort.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
that's
--
that's
cognizable.
that's
certainly
not
here.
what
we're
doing
is
looking
at
a
very
minor
adjustment
in
what
would
otherwise
be
a
straightforward
contract
action;
and
that
is
that
you
have
a
situation
where
the
international
displaced
the
local
after
the
contract
was
entered
into,
took
control,
and
that
control
we
manifested
in
several
specific
points
within
our
complaint.
and
another
way
--
it's
effectively
an
agency
relationship
between
the
--
at
that
point
between
the
international
and
the
local,
but
it's
an
agency
relationship
to
control
them
to
effect
the
breach.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
we
did
originally
look
at
an
agency
claim.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
under
an
agency
claim,
at
the
time
the
contract
was
formed,
it's
clear
the
local
was
not
operating
on
behalf
of
the
international.
it
was--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--the
question
to
decide
is
whether
there's
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
your
honor,
that
argument
really
isn't
new
at
all.
with
regard--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--it
is
in
our
briefs.
it
is
directly
in
our
briefs.
with
regard
to
a
footnote,
we
actually
say
that--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--we
take
the
position
that
the
contract
has
within
it
the
protection
of
the
contract.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
party
that
is
in
a
position
to
control
one
of
the
signatories
to
the
contract
and
they
cause
that
signatory
to
breach
the
contract,
and
--
then
in
every
regard
that
is
the
equivalent
of
a
violation
of
contract.
they
are
the
responsible
party.
they
--
to--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--your
honor--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--your
honor,
the
very
essence
of
section
301
was
to
deal
with
midterm
contract
strikes.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
your
honor,
what
you
have
just
described
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
labor
relations
is
exactly
what
we
are
focused
on
here.
this
is
not
any
party.
this
is
the
international
that
effectively
displaces,
takes
control,
tells
the
employer
that
they
have
the
independent
ability
to
resolve
the
dispute--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--we
originally
made
the
argument
that
they
were
--
they
were
the
moving
party,
the
undisclosed
principal,
that
actually
caused
the
contract
to
come
into
existence.
we
can't
factually
support
that.
they
were
upset
with
the
decision
to
enter
into
the
contract.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
we
abandoned
it
only
with
regard
to
formation.
we
absolutely
did
not
and
do
not
abandon
that
argument
thereafter
for
the
breach.
thereafter,
what
happened
is
you
have
the
international
taking
control
of
the
local
and
causing
the
local
to
breach
the
contract.
and
that
differentiates
it
from
many,
many
other
circumstances
where
you
have
third
parties.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
this
court
would--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
this
cause
of
action
would
clearly
be
pre-empted
under
allis-chalmers
and
subsequent
decisions.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
in
allis-chalmers,
the
court
did
address
the
pre-emption
doctrine
and
indicated
that
it
would
extend
to
torts.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
no,
your
honor,
i
think
you're
correct,
but--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
your
honor,
we
have
taken
the
strong
position
that
it
is
pre-empted
by
301.
it
will
involve
an
interpretation
of
the
contract
and
an
application
of
the
contract.
to
view
that
as
otherwise
not
pre-empted
would
be
to
start
attacking
301
in
terms
of
a
uniform
national
system
of
administering
contracts
in
federal
labor
law.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
the
issue
would
be
whether
the
action
of
engaging
in
the
strike
violates
the
nostrike
clause
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
i
think
there
is
a
dispute
about
that.
i
think
there's
a
dispute
about
the
underlying
existence
of
the
contract,
and
then
the
--
the
no-strike
clause
is
complex.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
yes.
that
order
was
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
it.
from
our
perspective,
it's
a
final
determination
that
july
2nd
is
the
starting
date
of
the
contract.
however,
you
still
have
a
formation
issue.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
we--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--that's
our
position.
we
succeeded
on
that
issue
before
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
we
agree
that
that
would
go
to
arbitration,
and
it's
scheduled
to
go
to
arbitration
between
the
local
and
the
company.
the
second
question
that
was
brought
to
play
in
this
particular
case
is
whether
the
formation
question
goes
to
an
arbitrator
or
goes
to--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--your
honor--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--your
honor,
the
critical
issue
isn't
the
nlrb
ruling,
although
that's
going
to
have
to
be
drawn
upon.
there
is
a
denial
that
a
contract
was
formed
on
july
2nd
that
continues
to
today.
and
the
question
is:
where
does
that
get
decided?
does
it
get
decided
in
a
court,
as
we
did
before
with
a
unanimous
jury
verdict?
or
does
that
now
get
vacated
and
sent
to
an
arbitrator
with
no
agreement--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--you're
--
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
right
at
the
center
of
the
analysis
in
that
we
contend,
the
company,
that
there
was
a
formation
on
july
2nd.
the
other
side
contends
that
something
happened
on
august
22nd
that
would
constitute
the
formation
event.
there
was
no
--
if
our
contract--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--it's
of
critical
importance
which
contract
was
formed,
because
there's
a
quid
pro
quo
in
labor
law
that's
critical,
and
that
is
that
you
agree
to
arbitration
in
exchange
for
a
no-strike
clause.
that
happened
on
the
2nd.
if
we
had
not
had
formation
on
july
2nd
and
the
first
formation
was
on
the
22nd
of
august,
then
we
would
have
been
denied
all
of
the
benefit
of
the
contract.
we
never
would
have
made
the
same
deal.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
a
critical
issue
in
labor
relations,
and
that
is
clearly
when
it's
ratified
brings
into
effect
the
no-strike
clause.
that's
embedded--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--the
no--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--well,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
completely
imprudent
for
to
us
say
that
in
may
the
no-strike
clause
was
in
effect.
it
wasn't,
because
the
parties
were
still
in
a
labor
dispute
and
negotiating.
july
2nd,
that's
when
the
no-strike
clause
came
into
effect.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
your
honor,
what's
really
central
is
the
fact
that
when
we
signed
in
december,
we
signed
the
agreement
of
july
2nd.
that
is
critical.
if
there
had
been
no
ratification
on
july
2nd,
there
would
be
no
contract.
and
when
the
union
signed,
they
take
the
position
that
they
signed
a
contract
ratified
on
august
22nd.
those
are
radically
different
events,
and
the
--
the
real
issue
then
is,
where
do
you
determine
this
core
initial
issue?
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
yes--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--justice
breyer,
the
second
contract,
if
it's
the
contract
as
proposed
by
the
other
side,
never
would
have
had
a
clause
with
that
much
money
in
it
because
we
would
have
had
to
absorb
for
the
strike.
we
signed
the
contract
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
the
contract
entered
into
july
2nd,
and--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--that's
correct.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
justice
alito,
that's
exactly
right.
we
agree
with
that.
it
wasn't.
i
mean,
there
is
a
crystal-clear
understanding
between
the
parties
that
the
time
of
ratification
is
the
time
that
the
no-strike
clause
came
into
effect,
and
if
there
was
no
ratification
on
july
2nd,
we
wouldn't
have
signed
the
contract
with
the
wage
levels
that
are
described
in
december.
when
we
signed
it,
we
signed
it
with
the
assumption
that
it
was
the
contract
that
was
formed
on
july
2nd.
and
the
issue
of
formation
was
never
given
to
arbitration.
the
arbitration
clause
in
this
particular
case
is
what
arises
under
the
contract.
it's
a
much
narrower
clause
than
this
court
has
seen
in
other
cases
and
was
not
submitted--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--justice
sotomayor,
we
take
the
position,
much
like
you've
indicated
in
your
hypothetical
or
actual
description,
that
the
nlrb
decision
is
definitive.
but
there
has
to
be
a
body,
an
entity,
that
actually
adjudicates
whether
this
is
preclusive,
and
the
question
is:
does
that
go
to
a
court,
as
it
already
has,
with
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
finding
that
it
was
ratified,
or
does
it
go
to
an
arbitrator,
who
then
looks
at
the
nlrb
decision
and
says,
i
guess
i
am
bound
by
it?
we
never
agreed
to
submit
the
formation
question
to
arbitration.
there
is
no
clear
and
unmistakable
agreement
to
do
that,
and
so,
consequently,
it's
the
forum
issue
of
where
that's
decided.
we
couldn't
agree
more
that
it's
a
futile
act.
in
other
words,
the
contract
is
now
final
and
over,
it
starts
on
july
2nd,
and
we
should
go
right
into
the
issue
of
whether
there's
a
breach
of
contract.
but
there's
this
interim
step
because
we
don't
yet
have
agreement
from
the
other
side
that
that
issue
is
moot
and
resolved.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
there
would
be
no--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--justice
ginsburg,
there's
no
question
that
the
parties
could
agree
to
have
formation
arbitrated
if
they
do
so
in
a
clear
and
unmistakable
way.
the
problem
that
we
have
here
--
we
agree
with
that
--
the
clause,
if
--
if
the
clause
included
formation,
then
that
issue
would
go
to
the
arbitrator.
but
the
issue
then
becomes
is
there
a
contract?
and
that's
a
threshold
issue,
that
you
have
to
bring
life
to
the
agreement
to
get
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
if--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--your
honor,
if
that
had
been,
let's
say,
4
years
later,
and
we
entered
into
a
new
contract
willingly
and
getting
the
exchange,
the
no-strike
clause
for
the
arbitration,
and
that
new
contract
said,
this
is
going
to
deal
with
all
past
disputes,
including
prior
contracts,
fine.
when
we
executed
that
contract
in
december,
we
executed
the
contract
that
we
believed
was
formed
in
july.
there
is
no
meeting
of
the
minds.
in
other
words,
the
union's
execution
was
on
a
contract
they
say
was
formed
on
the
22nd.
there
is
a
major,
major
issue
here,
and
that
is
on
july
2nd
we
made
the
concessions
on
wages,
working
conditions,
and
the
rest
of
it,
with
the
explicit
understanding
that
it
would
be
ratified
at
that
time.
stipulated
fact
number
16,
i
think
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
377,
has
that
qualification
in
it.
if
it
wasn't
ratified
on
july
2nd,
then
what
happened
is
it
was
withdrawn,
it
exploded,
there
was
nothing,
there
was
nothing
to
be
signed
in
december.
we
only
signed
what
was
agreed
to
on
july
2nd
and
maintained
that
position
because
we
believe
we
got
the
benefit
and
the
protection
of
a
no-strike
clause
all
the
way
through
that
time
period.
and
so
that
is
the
critical
distinction.
and
now
i
couldn't
agree
more
with
this
court
that
it's
an
academic
exercise
to
go
to
either
an
arbitrator
or
a
court
on
whether
it
is
in
effect
as
of
july
2nd.
we
believe
the
nlrb
decision
is
preclusive
in
that
regard.
but
there
is
underneath
it,
there
has
to
be
a
forum.
there
has
to
be
somebody
to
say
that.
if
an
arbitrator
got
the
case,
looked
at
it,
said,
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
really
agree
with
the
nlrb,
and
i
think
i'm
going
to
decide
it
differently,
and
that
then
went
to
review
in
a
court,
and
the
arbitrator
made
a
mistake
of
law,
a
mistake
of
fact,
it's
not
completely
clear
to
me
that
we
would
be
able
to
come
back
to
this
court
and
get
it
effectively
changed.
we
are
saying
that
the
issue
of
formation
was
submitted
to
the
court,
it
was
litigated.
and
i
would
like
to
very
much,
chief
justice,
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
categorically,
your
honor,
the
nlrb
has
no
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
in
footnote
18
of
our
reply
brief,
we
recount
the
history.
that
paperworkers'
case
that
was
just
referenced,
the
international
was
a
signatory.
it
was
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
and,
therefore,
it
had
status
under
section
8(b)(3).
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
it's
footnote
18
of
our
reply
brief,
and
we
recount
the
history
that
was
litigated
both
at
the
ninth
circuit
and
beyond.
there
is
no
remedy
before
the
nlrb--
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
--justice
breyer,
there
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
that
that's
just
not
right,
and
that
is
that
the
conduct
involved
here
was
causing
a
violation
of
a
contract.
the
international
took
control
of
the
local
and
forced
the
breach.
this
is
the
--
this
conduct
would
never
be
sanctioned
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
had
access
to
it,
but
the
--
wisely,
i
think,
the
structure
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
--
the
8(b)(3)
remedy
is
against
an
exclusive
agent.
they
have
to
be
the
bargaining
agent.
international
is
not
the
bargaining
agent.
and
so,
consequently,
if
we
accepted
the
position
of
the
international,
you
would
create
a
no-man's
zone
that
would
apply
throughout
this
country,
whereby
collective
bargaining
agreements
entered
into
by
locals
could
be
destroyed,
violated,
by
an
international
that
would
choose
to
impose
itself
on
the
local
and
cause
that
to
happen.
most
internationals
are
responsible.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
your
--
your
honor,
i
think
it's
well-established
this
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice,
because
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
under
section
8(b)(3).
what
is
suggested
here
is
that
maybe
there
is
a
no-man's
zone
that
congress
should
go
to
and
regulate,
but
if
you
back
up
to
1947
and
the
passage
of
section
301,
it's
inconceivable
that
in
passing
that
statute
congress
intended
to
leave
all
international
unions,
or
anybody
that
controlled
a
party,
completely
free
from
any
reach
of
law.
mr.
garry
g.
mathiason
well,
it
is
not
an
exclusive
representative.
in
other
words,
8(b)(3)
contemplates
a
bargaining
obligation
on
the
part
of
an
exclusive
representative,
and
the
international
is
not
in
that
capacity.
they
had
control,
but
they
aren't
designated
in
that
manner,
and
there's
not
one
nlrb
case
in
the
history
of
that
agency
that
deviates
from
that,
or
we
would
have
been
on
it
immediately.
and
it
just
isn't
there.
so
we
were
looking
at
our
options,
and
state
court
appeared
to
be
very
clearly
pre-empted
by
allis
--
chalmers
and
a
row
of
cases.
so
that
meant
that
the
federal
law,
section
301,
as
suggested
by
lincoln
mills,
would
absorb.
please
recognize
that
what
we
are
seeking
here
--
the
labels
of
tort
and
contract
create,
i
think,
a
false
distinction.
we
are
effectively
bringing
a
contract
action
for
violation
of
a
contract.
the
linkage
is
strictly
to
add
in
the
international
as
the
acting
party.
