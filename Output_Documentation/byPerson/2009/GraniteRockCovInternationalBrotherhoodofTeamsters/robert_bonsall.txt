mr.
robert
bonsall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
turn
to
some
questions
that
were
just
raised.
this
is
not
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
contract
dated
july
2nd,
nor
is
this
a
question
of
whether
there
was
a
contract
dated
august
22nd.
those
are
issues
of
contract
ratification.
there
is
only
one
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
the
employer's
first
amended
complaint.
the
trial
court
recognized
this
fact,
in
joint
appendix
page
231.
the
contract
was
attached
to
the
--
to
the
complaint
lodging
a
breach
of
contract
against
this
labor
organization.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
says,
on
the
very
first
page
and
the
very
last
page,
that
the
effective
date
is
may
1st,
2004,
and
its
expiration
date
is
april
30th
of
2008.
mr.
robert
bonsall
the
issue,
your
--
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
whether
the
parties
when
they
entered
into
that
agreement
and
made
that
entire
agreement
retroactive
to
may
1st
of
2004,
whether
the
parties
intended
that
the
retroactivity
clause
would
apply
for
all
purposes
to
any
disputes
arising
to
the
parties.
for
example--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--well--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--we
contend
that
it
would
not,
and
here's
the
reason
why.
if--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--well,
i
think
that
it's
important
for
two
reasons.
first,
factually,
if
the
court
places
itself
in
the
position
of
the
parties
on
july
1st,
at
that
point
in
time
some
things
are
clear.
the
union
and
its
members
have
been
out
on
strike
for
approximately
3
weeks,
and
they
have
engaged
in
tough
negotiations
at
the
bargaining
table
trying
to
reach
a
new
contract,
because
that
old
contract
had
expired
almost
2
months
ago.
and
the
parties
reach
a
tentative
agreement
on
all
the
wages,
hours,
and
terms
of
conditions
of
employment.
but
then
the
parties
also
incorporate
a
retroactivity
clause,
to
make
sure
that
all
these
rights
and
benefits
would
inure
to
the
union
members
beginning
may
1,
the
day
after
the
last
contract
expired.
the
court
should
ask
itself
that
--
when
the
union
and
its
members
are
engaging
in
lawful,
protected,
concerted
activity,
a
strike,
on
july
1,
did
they
intend
to
convert
that
lawful
economic
activity
into
a
breach
of
contract?
mr.
robert
bonsall
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bonsall
no,
i
think--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--on
july
2nd,
as
counsel
has
indicated,
there
is
a
real
dispute,
a
continuing
dispute,
between
the
parties
whether
the
contract
was
ratified
on
july
2nd.
mr.
robert
bonsall
we
think
that
the
--
there
is
only
one
contract,
your
honor.
that
contract
was
executed
on
december
14th
by
management's
representative
and
december
17th
by
the
union's
representative.
that's
the
labor
agreement.
now--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--well,
the
fact
that
counsel
has
reiterated
over
and
over
again
that
this
is
a
question
of
contract
formation
--
in
fact
there
is
no
formation
issue
when
the
court
is
being
asked
to
decide
whether
there
is
an
arbitral
issue.
the
court
needs
to
look
at
the
collective
bargaining
agreement;
and
the
contract
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
that
the
party
--
the
union
--
made
its
demand
for
arbitration
clearly
indicated
that
there
was
a
contract
in
place,
and
it
contained
a
--
an
--
excuse
me
--
extremely
broad
arbitration
provision,
that
requires
that
all
disputes
--
all
disputes
arising
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
be
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provision.
mr.
robert
bonsall
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
on
july
26th
of
2004,
the
union
was
confronting
a
boys
markets
injunction
that
was
being
sought
by
the
employer.
the
issue
before
the
trial
court
was
whether
the
union
should
be
enjoined,
its
strike
should
be
enjoined.
and
counsel
for
the
union
took
the
clear
position
that
there
was
not
a
contract
in
place
at
that
time
on
july
26th,
but
even
if
there
was,
the
injunction
should
not
issue
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
buffalo
forge.
the
matter
that
was
continuing
to
be
an
issue
in
conflict
did
not
arise
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
it
involved
other
labor
organizations
and
essentially
a
back-to-work
agreement.
so
on
july
26th,
the
union
did
take
the
position
that
there
was
no
contract,
but
the
reason
why
an
injunction
was
not
appropriate
was
because
of
buffalo
forge.
i
don't
know
if
that
addresses--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--no.
there
was
no
question
about
arbitrating
anything.
the
employer
didn't
ask
to
have
arbitration
at
all
at
the
july
26th
hearing.
the
only
question
at
that
point
in
time
was
whether
there
was
ratification
or
not.
the
employer
insisted
that
the
union's
representative
had
made
a
communication
to
the
employer's
representative
that
the
contract
had
been
ratified.
having
the
witnesses
for
both
labor
and
management
in
the
courtroom,
judge
ware
said,
well,
i'll
take
evidence
regarding
whether
this
communication
occurred.
did
george
netto
represent
to
bruce
woolpert
that
in
fact
a
contract
had
been
ratified?
that
was
the
very
narrow
issue
decided
by--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--we
think
that
there's
still
an
issue
that
is
being
sent
to
the
arbitrator,
the
breach
of
contract
and
damages,
but
as
a
precursor
to
that,
we
contend
that
the
issue
never
should
have
been
litigated
at
all
by
the
trial
court
about
whether
there
was
formation,
because
there
was
no
question
of
formation
at
that
time.
it
was
only
a
question
of
contract
ratification,
and
that
issue
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
broad
arbitration
provision
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
when
we
go
back--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--correct.
mr.
robert
bonsall
yes.
mr.
robert
bonsall
uh-huh.
mr.
robert
bonsall
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
the
employer
is
alleging
that
there
is
a
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause.
the
union
is
alleging
a
defense
to
that
allegation
by
asserting
a
meritsbased
issue
regarding
whether,
in
a
certain
narrow
gap
period,
falling
in
between
the
effective
date
of
the
contract--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--that's--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--yes.
mr.
robert
bonsall
he
will
not.
mr.
robert
bonsall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bonsall
we
expect
the
arbitrator
to
take
a
look
at
the
facts
that
existed
on
july
2nd
and
make
a
determination
whether
in
fact
at
that
point
in
time
the
union
has
a
meritorious
claim
that
the
contract
was
not
ratified,
and
therefore
the
no-strike
clause--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--absolutely.
both
parties
openly
negotiated
and
hammered
out
and
had
their
representatives
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
employer
was
entirely
free,
if
it
was
inclined
to
do
so,
to
suggest
that
they
would
not
sign
an
agreement
unless
the
union
consented.
mr.
robert
bonsall
no.
mr.
robert
bonsall
the
arbitrator
would
not
be
deciding
contract
formation.
the
arbitrator
would
be
deciding
within
the
scope
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
whether
the
no-strike
clause
was
effective
to
bind
the
employer
--
excuse
me
--
to
bind
the
union
from
a
short
period
of
time
from
july
2nd
to
august
22nd.
that
would
be
the
only
real
claim,
because
the
union
actually
--
there's
no
question
--
was
out
on
strike.
this
is
not
in
dispute.
what
the
trial
court
did
in
this
case
was
to
usurp
the
function
of
the
arbitrator.
the
parties
selected
one
arbitrator.
mr.
robert
bonsall
yes.
mr.
robert
bonsall
yes,
i
--
i
think
this
court
has
addressed
that
very
issue,
justice
ginsburg,
in
drake
bakeries.
an
employer
was
confronted
with
a
strike.
the
employer
immediately
went
into
federal
court
and
filed
a
breach
of
contract
action
against
the
labor
organization,
and
it
insisted
that
these
two
contract
provisions,
the
right
--
the
no-strike
clause
and
the
grievance
procedure,
were
inextricably
tied.
and
this
court
pointed
out
that
they
are
not
in
all
circumstances
exact
counterweights.
mr.
robert
bonsall
when
they
signed
the
agreement,
your
honor,
they
absolutely
did
get
the
benefit
of
it.
there
was
no
strike
at
all
after
august
22nd
that
was--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--in
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
robert
bonsall
absolutely.
if
there
was
a
subsequent
strike
at
any
time
in--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--there
was
not,
your
honor.
after
--
after--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
the
--
i
think
the
arbitrator
will
be--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--there
absolutely
was
a
strike.
it
began
in
the
early
weeks
of
june.
mr.
robert
bonsall
and
it
continued,
actually,
through
september
22nd
of
2004.
that
was
the
duration
that
the
union
was
on
strike.
mr.
robert
bonsall
yes.
mr.
robert
bonsall
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
bonsall
our
defense
to
the
allegation
of
the
no-strike
clause
before
the
arbitrator
would
be
that
at
that
time
the
parties
had
not
ratified
the
agreement,
and
that
ratification
did
not
occur
until
august
22nd,
which
also
appears
as
a
concession
by
the
employer
in
paragraph
27
of
their
third
amended
complaint.
they
also
say
that
the
contract
was
ratified
on
august
22nd.
mr.
robert
bonsall
or
august
22nd,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bonsall
then--
mr.
robert
bonsall
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bonsall
if
i
may
finish?
mr.
robert
bonsall
in
substance
it's
contract
formation
if
you
can
place
yourself
back
in
time
on
july
2nd
or
august
22nd.
it
is
moot
and
entirely
academic
when
the
parties
ratify
an
agreement
at
some
point
in
time
and
sign
the
contract
in
december.
there
is
no
question
of
contract
formation
in
this
case.
there's
only
a
question
of
contract
ratification
during
a
very
narrow
period.
mr.
robert
bonsall
under
drake
bakeries,
we
do
not
believe
that
we
are
severing
at
all.
we
think
that
when
an
employer
brings
a
breach
of
contract
claim
in
federal
court
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
contains
a
broad
arbitration
clause,
their
remedy
is
to
seek
that
breach
of
contract
and
damage
claim
before
the
arbitrator.
mr.
robert
bonsall
thank
you.
