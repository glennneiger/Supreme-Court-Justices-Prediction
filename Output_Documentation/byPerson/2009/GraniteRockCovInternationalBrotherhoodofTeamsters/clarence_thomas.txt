justice
clarence
thomas
first
case
in
which
i
have
the
opinion
is
08-1214,
granite
rock
company
versus
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioner
granite
rock
is
a
california
company
that
that
employs
members
of
the
respondent
unions,
teamsters
local
and
its
parent
respondent
international
brotherhood
of
teamster.
i
will
refer
to
former
as
local
and
the
later
as
ibt.
granite
rock’s
relationship
with
local
is
governed
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
cba
that
granite
rock
negotiated
with
local
on
july
2nd,
2004.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
strike
that
local
initiated,
granite
rock
sued
the
union
and
in
district
court
claiming
that
strike
violated
the
cbas
no
strike
clause.
granite
rock
also
sued
ibt
for
interfering
with
the
cba.
local
and
ibt
moved
to
dismiss
granite
rock
suit.
the
district
court
granted
ibt’s
motion
to
dismiss
finding
that
a
federal
court
can
not
recognize
a
tort
claim
for
interference
with
the
cba
by
a
non-signatory.
local
in
turn
argued
that
its
strike
did
not
violate
the
cba’s
no
strike
provision
because
its
members
had
not
yet
voted
to
ratify
the
cba
and
thus
the
cba
was
not
yet
enforceable.
local
also
argued
that
granite
rock’s
no
strike
claim
did
not
belong
in
federal
court
because
the
cba
required
all
disputes
arising
under
its
provision
to
go
to
arbitration.
the
district
court
agreed
with
local
that
granite
rock’s
no
strike
claim
was
arbitratable
but
held
that
there
was
a
factual
question
about
when
the
cba
was
ratified
and
this
question
was
before
that
court
not
an
arbitrator
to
resolve.
after
jury
found
that
the
cba
was
ratified
on
july
2nd,
the
court
sent
granite
rocks
no-strike
claim
to
arbitration.
all
parties
appealed.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
granite
rocks
claims
against
ibt
but
reversed
the
district
court's
arbitration
rule.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reversed
in
part,
affirm
in
part.
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeal’s
arbitration
ruling
because
it
does
not
accord
with
our
decisions
that
arbitration
is
strictly
a
matter
of
agreement,
thus
a
court
may
not
order
parties
to
arbitrate
the
particular
dispute
unless
the
court
is
satisfied
that
the
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate
that
dispute.
the
record
and
arguments
probably
before
us
do
not
establish
that
granite
rock
agreed
to
do
so.
we
affirm
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
refusal
to
recognize
new
federal
tort
claim
under
the
labor
management
relations
act,
that
granite
rock
alleges
against
ibt
even
assuming
that
the
act
authorizes
us
to
recognize
the
claim,
the
record
does
not
support
granite
rock’s
argument
that
such
a
claim
would
be
necessary
to
supplement
other
means
of
addressing
ibt’s
alleged
interference
with
the
cba.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
in
which
justice
stevens
joins.
