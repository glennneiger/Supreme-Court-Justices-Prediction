justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean
--
if
you're
coming
up
and
saying,
well,
we
have
a
principal-agent
here,
i
could
understand
that,
but
that's
i
didn't
think
the
question
we
are
here
to
decide.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
--
on
the
tortious
interference
as
to
whether
or
not
that's
under
301.
sure,
agent-principal,
i
understand
that.
but
that
--
that's
a
new
argument
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
briefs?
is
it
part
of
the
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
--
the
basic
question
is
--
the
chief
justice
began
with
it
--
isn't
this
--
isn't
this
a
tort
action?
you
say,
well,
it's
grounded
in
contract.
i
--
i
really
have
a
problem
with
the
word
"grounded".
if
you
say
it
necessarily
implicates
or
it's
entangled,
then
i
could
understand
that.
but
grounded
in
contract
--
we
ask
what
the
source
of
the
original
obligation
is.
and
these
parties
were
not
--
or
the
international
was
not
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
strongest
argument
you
have
is
that
this
tortious
interference
is
pre-empted
under
state
law.
so
we
have
a
--
a
vacuum
if
we
don't
accept
--
accept
your
view.
let
me
ask
you
this:
my
understanding
is
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
please
--
this
court
has
not
said
that
they
--
that
the
state
law
cause
of
action
for
interference
with
contract
relations
is
preempted.
this
court
has
not
said
that.
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
circuits
have
said
that,
but
we
haven't
said
that.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i'm
talking
--
i'm
talking
specifically
that
--
interference
with
advantageous
business
relations
or
interfering
with
an
existing
contract
--
that,
we
have
not
addressed
in
this
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
it
did
not
--
it
did
not
include
interference
with
a
--
with
a
contractual
relation.
we
have
not,
as
a
specific
holding
--
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
will
look
at
allis-chalmers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
one
of
your
strongest
points
is
that
this
is
pre
empted
by
state
law.
if
--
if
that's
not
true,
then
we
would
be
deciding
the
case
based
on
a
premise
that
is
--
is
unclear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
cause
of
action
for
interference
with
a
contract
has
been
pre-empted
insofar
as
state
law
is
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
position
on
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
--
do
you
--
does
your
client
take
the
position
that
that
law
is
correct,
that
the
federal
law
has
pre-empted
state
law
actions
for
interference
with
--
with
contract
relations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
then
you
are
submitting
to
this
court
that
the
purpose
of
the
national
relation
--
labor
relations
act
and
its
effect
was
to
give
immunity
to
unions
for
intentional
interference
with
contractual
relations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
that
the
effect
of
your
argument
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
it's
outside
301,
where
does
pre-emption
come
from,
garmon?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
could
interrupt
just
for
a
moment?
allis-chalmers
was
301.
allis-chalmers
says
301
covers
contract,
and,
therefore,
there's
a
pre-emption.
so
i
take
it
you're
not
talking
about
allis-chalmers
pre-emption.
you
are
talking
about
garmon
or
machinists
or
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
say
both
of
them,
then
we're
back
where
we
started.
if
301
preempts,
then
it
should
be
within
the
ambit
of
301's
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
court.
