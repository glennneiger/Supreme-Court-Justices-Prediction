chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
08-1214,
granite
rock
company
v.
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters.
mr.
mathiason.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
tort
action,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
--
grounded
in
contract.
i
suppose
the
existence
of
a
contract
is
an
evidentiary
matter
that
you
have
to
establish,
but
the
cause
of
action
is
still
tort,
and
of
course
301(a)
is
limited
to
violations
of
contracts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
somebody
who
is
not
a
party
to
the
contract
can
violate
the
contract.
they
can
be
liable
for
all
sorts
of
things,
but
i
don't
see
that
they
can
be
liable
for
violating
the
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
you
can
have
tortious
interference
with
the
contract.
can
you,
without
the
--
establishing
the
existence
of
a
contract?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
suppose
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--tortious
interference
with
--
what
is
it,
the
ability
to
enter
into
a
contract,
i
think,
is
recognized
in
some
jurisdictions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
it's
a
question
for
your
friends
on
the
other
side
whether
they
think
the
ratification
or
the
contract
that
was
entered
into
in
december
that's
effective
in
may
--
if
that
makes
them
liable
for
violating
the
no-strike
clause,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
happens
if
it's
ratified
retroactively?
is
the
no-strike
clause
in
effect?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
want
to
say
yes,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bonsall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
there
was
a
contract
beginning
may
22nd,
then
that
included
the
no-strike
clause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
you
don't
think
--
i
guess
this
is
following
up
on
justice
alito's
question.
you
don't
think
it
included
the
nostrike
clause--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--for
--
that
would
apply
to
july
2nd?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it
doesn't
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
but
if
it
doesn't
include
the
no-strike
clause
and
the
question
is
whether
the
july
2nd
one
does,
all
this
talk
about
the
december
agreement
being
retroactive
to
may
is
really
kind
of
beside
the
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
i'm
sorry,
but
that's
the
central
issue.
your
friend
says
no,
we
had
a
contract
on
july
2nd,
and
that's
for
the
court
to
determine,
not
the
arbitrator,
because
it's
a
question
of
formation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
do
you
expect
the
arbitrator
to
do?
the
arbitrator
--
since
you
agree
that
there's
a
contract
in
effect--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
arbitrator
is
not
going
to
decide
whether
the
contract
is
there
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
contract
has
a
no-strike
clause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
expect
the
arbitrator
to
say
you
get
the
benefit
of
the
contract
that
lets
me
decide
something,
and
even
though
there's
a
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract,
you
want
the
arbitrator
to
say
that
no-strike
clause
is
not
operative
on
july
2nd?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
but
even
though
the
later
agreement
was
that
it
would
be
retroactive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
an
issue
for
the
arbitrator?
now
that
we
know
there
was
an
agreement
on
july
2nd,
is
the
question
whether
the
strike
continued
or
not
for
the
arbitrator?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say
there
was
no
strike,
and
i
--
i
thought
the
other
side
said
there
was.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
but
their
position
is
that
there
was
a
contract
on
july
2nd
that
included
a
no-strike
clause--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
you
violated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
and
your
answer
is,
one,
that
there
is
no
contract,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
--
and
that
position
depends
upon
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
that
you
are
severing
arbitration
and
the
no-strike
obligation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
nussbaum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
against
the
international?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i'd
like
your
broader
perspective
as
a
representative
of
the
international,
because
i
think
it's
an
important
issue
of
labor
policy.
if
i
think
that
the
cause
of
actions
available
under
301(a)
and
the
pre-emptive
effect
of
301(a)
ought
to
be
coextensive,
which
--
which
do
you
prefer,
a
broader
301(a)
or
a
narrower
pre-emption?
i
think
it
makes
a
difference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
301
--
i
think
whatever
--
i
don't
think
there
should
be
a
noman's
land
between
you
can
bring
your
action
under
301
and
it's
pre-empted
by
301.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
you
are
right,
that
they
cannot
bring
a
tortious
interference
action
under
301,
i
don't
think
it
should
be
pre-empted.
if
you
are
wrong
and
they
can
bring
it,
then
i
can
understand
that
it
should
be
pre-empted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
was
pre-empted
by
301,
and
they
cannot
bring
it
under
301?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
if
granite
rock
brought
this
claim
in
state
court,
you
would
say
it's
pre-empted
by
301?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then,
if
they
turned
around
and
brought
it
in
federal
court
under
301,
you
would
say,
no,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
301?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
is
in
a
noman's
land.
their
claim
for
tortious
interference
with
contract
just
can't
be
brought
anywhere?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
could
always
go
to
the
nlrb--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
state
court
or
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
bring
it
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
would
the
makewhole
--
i
gather
a
cease-and-desist
wouldn't
make
any
sense
because
this
is
over,
but
what
would
the
makewhole
remedy
entail?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
applies
in
301.
they're
not
touching
the
contract.
they're
not
touching
the
parties
to
the
contract.
this
is
outside
the
contract.
so
why
should
it
be
pre-empted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mathiason,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
where
is
that
again?
footnote
18?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
