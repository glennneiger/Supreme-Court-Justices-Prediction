justice
samuel
a.
alito,

well,
then
you
could
have
sued
on
an
agency
claim,
couldn't
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
am
i
correct
that
neither
you,
neither
granite
rock
nor
the
local,
thinks
that
the
december
collective
bargaining
agreement
really
was
fully
retroactive?
they
don't
think
it
was--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
meant
that
the
nostrike
clause
was
in
effect
on
the
day
when
the
old
collective
bargaining
agreement
expired,
and
you
don't
think
that
the
new
arbitration
clause
was
in
effect
on
the
day
when
the
old
collective
bargaining
agreement
expired,
or
do
i
not
understand
your
positions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
say
no,
but
what
do
you
say
about
the
--
but
you
say
that
the
arbitration
clause
was
intended
to
be
retroactive.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
say
that
the
arbitration
clause
--
or
do
you?
in
the
later
--
in
the
agreement
that
was
ratified
in
december
was
retroactive?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
neither
one
is
retroactive?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
understand
that.
i've
having
difficulty
--
can
we
just
put
the
december
--
in
the
view
of
both
sides,
can
we
just
put
the
december
agreement
aside?
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
argument
that's
before
us.
the
argument
before
us
has
to
do
with
the
--
whether
there
was
a
ratification
on
july
the
2nd.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
in
substance,
you
--
you
think
that
the
arbitrator
would
decide
the
issue
of
contract
formation,
whether--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
i
thought
you
just
said
that
the
arbitrator
would
decide
whether
there
was
an
agreement
on
july
the
2nd.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that
would
be
an
issue
for
the
--
you
think
that
that
would
be
an
issue
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide,
whether
there
was
a
contract
ratified
on
july
the
2nd?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
the
arbitrator
thought
that
it
was
in
existence
on
july
2nd,
then--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
would
lose?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
that's
an
issue
of
contract
formation;
is
it
not?
in
substance
it
is.
