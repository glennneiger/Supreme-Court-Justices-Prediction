justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
suddenly
it's
all
a
lot
of
things
that
would
have
been
pre-empted
to
go
to
the
board.
for
example,
you
have
a
labor
dispute
on
a
construction
business,
and
one
union's
out
there
telling
the
other:
keep
on
going.
and
then
some
other
group
comes
in
and
says:
don't
let
them
do
that
to
you.
and
another
says:
you
don't
have
to
do
that
under
your
contract.
and
there
are
19
unions
and
they
are
all
fighting
about
--
each
other,
and
everybody
is
going
to
end
up
suing
each
other
in
federal
court.
i
thought
the
purpose
of
the
lmra
was
to
stop
that.
the
purpose
of
the
labor
act,
the
wagner
act
was
to
stop
that.
they
didn't
want
federal
courts
any
more
than
state
courts
interfering
in
that
kind
of
thing.
so
why
should
we
read
an
exception
into
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
reproduce
the
situation
that
led
all
the
congresses
and
presidents
in
the
1930s
to
stop
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right,
and
they
said:
here's
how
we'll
deal
with
that.
we'll
deal
with
that
by
giving
the
employer
and
the
union
a
right
to
go
into
court
and
enforce
the
contract
or
get
damages
for
its
violation.
that
we
figure
furthers
labor
relations.
but
it's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
see
how
it
could
further
labor
relations
by
letting
any
third
party
under
the
sun
come
in
and
say
everything
that
went
on
during
a
labor
dispute
is
a
--
is
a
tort
in
respect
to
the
contract
that
might
not
even
have
been
signed
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what
--
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
formation,
just
as
justice
sotomayor
said.
there
is
a
contract,
the
contract
that
was
signed
on
december
17th.
it
is
formed.
you
don't
doubt
that
it's
formed.
they
don't
doubt
that
it's
formed.
and
that
contract
has
an
arbitration
agreement
in
it.
and
one
of
the
questions
that
will
be
arbitrated,
i
take
it,
is
whether
that
december
17th
contract,
because
of
its
retroactivity
provisions,
provides
damages
for
what
happened
in
july.
and
part
of
that
will
require
the
arbitrator
to
interpret
the
december
17th
contract--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
decide
whether
it
does
cover
that
event
of
july
2nd.
now,
what
has
this
got
to
do
--
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
--
is
that-i
mean,
what
is
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
why
isn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
think
people
are
not
communicating.
imagine
on
december
17th
you
and
i
enter
into
a
contract
and
it's
all
written
in
red,
all
right?
and
one
of
these
red
sentences
says:
i
will
pay
you
$32
extra
an
hour
from
the
moment
that
the
blue
contract
went
into
effect.
see?
now,
whether
--
that
moment
when
the
blue
contract
went
into
effect
is
a
question,
isn't
it,
that
we
would
turn
over
to
the
arbitrator,
the
person
who
is
arbitrating
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
red
contract.
that's
simply
a
question
of
fact
and
contractual
meaning
like
any
other.
now,
what
have
i
said
that's
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
that
a
difficult
issue?
i
can
easily
modify
the
hypothetical.
the
red
contract
says:
joe
smith
will
be
paid
$32
extra
an
hour
from
the
moment
when
this
red
contract
takes
effect.
okay?
and,
now
we
have
an
issue,
when
everybody's
agreed,
we'll
send
the
meaning
of
the
contract
to
arbitration.
we'll
send
the
application
of
the
contract
to
--
to
arbitration.
one
of
the
questions
is:
when,
for
purposes
of
the
$32,
did
this
contract,
which
we
have
admittedly
signed,
take
effect?
why
isn't
that
question
for
an
arbitrator?
is
there
any
authority
at
all--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--anywhere
that
says
it
isn't
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
even
know
what
authority-what
reasoning
it
would
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
of
another
way
of
putting
this
because
i
am
having
a
hard
time
with
it.
you
and
i
could
do
this,
couldn't
we?
we
could
try
to
enter
into
a
contract
on
may
1,
and
who
knows
what
happens,
we
disagree
about
what
happened,
and
by
the
way
that
had
an
arbitration
clause
in
it.
now,
whether
--
since
we
disagree
about
it,
that
would
go
to
the
judge,
whether
we
formed
that
contract
with
its
arbitration
clause,
because
everything's
up
in
the
air.
a
year
later,
we
enter
into
another
contract,
and
what
that
contract
says
is,
we
are
going
to
arbitrate
every
dispute
between
us,
including
that
old
dispute
about
whether
there
was
that
old
contract,
okay?
and
we
could
do
that,
and
then
you
would
--
you
would
certainly
arbitrate
the
issue
of
contract
formation,
even
for
the
old
one,
because
we
said
we
would
do
it,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
why
isn't
the
december
17th
contract
that
second
contract
in
respect
to
the
july
2nd?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
before
you
finish,
chief,
is
it
all
right
if
you
--
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
how
this
pre-emption
works,
and
i
perhaps
didn't
have
it
right.
but
imagine
301
had
never
been
enacted.
i
thought,
had
that
never
been
enacted,
certain
kinds
of
state
claims,
particularly
tort
claims
of
interference
with
labor
contracts,
for
example,
might
have
been
pre-empted
anyway
by
the
labor
relations
--
by
the
--
by
the
lmra.
i
thought
that
did
the
basic
pre-emptive
job.
and
then
where
it
is
pre-empted
by
the
lmra,
301
creates
an
exception
to
the
pre-emption,
so
that
it
isn't
pre-empted,
if
you
have
a
suit.
now,
my
thinking
is
probably
out-of-date
and
wrong,
so
i
would
like
you
to
explain
how
it
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
because
i
think
that
your
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
which
is
why
i
became
uncertain,
is
that
it
is
the
lmra
--
not
the
lmra
at
all
that
pre-empts
tort
actions
and
state
activities
that
interfere
with
labor
relations,
as
this
might.
it
is,
rather,
section
301
itself
that
pre-empts
it,
and
then
it
is
odd
because
it
pre-empts
it,
but
it
says,
we
won't
give
you
any,
and
--
and
that's
why
i
became
uncertain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
be,
but
then
you
might
have
--
then
you'd
have
a
remedy
in
state
court.
i
think
the
argument
was
that
--
anyway,
i
have
this
argument:
301
doesn't
pre-empt
anything
but
the
contract
claim.
now,
go
bring
your
claim
in
state
court.
you
might
have
a
good
claim
in
state
court
that
isn't
pre-empted.
suppose
one
of
their
employees
hit
somebody
over
the
head.
you'd
have
a
great
claim,
and
that
isn't
going
to
be
pre-empted.
now,
yours
might
be,
because
there
is
a
set
of
tort
actions
in
state
court
that
the
labor
acts
pre-empt;
in
particular,
those
that
involve
conduct
that
is
arguably
protected
or
arguably
forbidden
by
the
labor
acts.
so,
if
you
fall
outside
that
category,
you
are
not
pre-empted.
and
if
you
fall
inside
the
category,
you
should
be
pre-empted;
not
by
301,
but
by
the
labor
law
which
gave
this
kind
of
decision
to
the
labor
board
to
make.
what
is
--
is
that
argument
sensible?
is
it
right?
what
do
you
think?
