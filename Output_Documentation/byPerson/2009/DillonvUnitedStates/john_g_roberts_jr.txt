chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-6338,
dillon
v.
united
states.
ms.
freeland.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
sentencing
commission
just
issued
a
new
guideline
and
said:
anyone
with
a
--
a
crack
sentence,
their
sentence
is
going
to
be
reduced
by
10
percent.
that
wouldn't
present
any
problems,
would
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there's
no
--
but
3553(a)
doesn't
even
come
into
play
under
my
hypothetical.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
3553(a)
doesn't
even
come
into
play,
so
there's
not
a
resentencing
by
a
judge.
it
is
just
an
across-the-board
policy,
like
increasing
good
time
credits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
in
--
in
this
case.
but
in
my
hypothetical
congress
hasn't
done
that.
it
hasn't
--
or
the
sentencing
commission
hasn't
done
that.
they
haven't
invoked
the
discretionary
sentencing.
they
just
said:
across
the
board,
10
percent
off.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
only
booker?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
only
booker?
what
if
there
is
another
constitutional
objection
to
the
sentence,
and
it
goes
back
under
--
under
the
crack
cocaine?
can
you
say,
oh,
and,
you
know,
also,
it
violated
my
rights
under
equal
protection?
you
didn't
notice
that
before,
but
here's
the
argument.
is
that
before
the
sentencing
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
you
would
you
have
to
say
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
it's
not
only
as
unfair
as
justice
ginsburg
hypothesized.
it's
even
more
unfair
than
that,
because
just
because
of
the
crack
cocaine
change,
somebody
with
an
equal
protection
challenge
gets
to
raise
that.
well,
somebody
in
prison
without
an
equal
--
with
an
equal
protection
challenge
but
not
the
crack
cocaine
one
is
still
stuck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
a
new
constitutional
rule.
this
is
an
old
one.
this
is
one
that
was
--
you
know,
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
on
the
books
for
a
while.
and
--
and
he
--
he
just
gets
the
chance
to
raise
it
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
his
conviction
involved
crack
cocaine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no,
no.
i
thought
under
your
theory
this
is
a
whole
new
sentencing.
so
who
cares
if
he
waived
it
at
the
first
one.
we
are
starting
from
--
from
point
zero.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
my
point
is
that
they
shouldn't
under
your
theory.
the
fact
that
he
waived
it
at
the
earlier
sentencing
under
your
theory
should
not
matter
at
all.
because
your
theory
is
that
this
is
a
whole
new
sentencing,
so
who
cares
what
went
on
in
the
prior
sentencing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
why
--
why
could
they
--
the
first
part
of
that,
why
could
they
not
hold
him
for
the
term
under
the
1993
sentence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
miss
freeland.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
am
troubled
by
your
response
to
justice
kennedy's
previous
question,
that
the
judge
can
take
into
account
conduct
in
prison
and
all
these
other
things.
it
does
seem
to
open
it
up
to
other
factors
than
the
crack
cocaine
disparity,
and
once
you
are
looking
at
other
factors,
why
not
look
at
everything?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
--
it's
also
a
factor
that
would
--
might
guide
the
district
court
to
a
decision
not
to
reduce
the
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
kruger.
ms.
freeland,
have
you
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
three.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
an
opinion
this
morning
in
case
09-6338,
dillon
vs.
united
states.
