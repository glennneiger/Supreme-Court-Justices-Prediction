ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
provisions
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
at
issue
in
this
case,
unlike
the
provisions
that
were
at
issue
in
booker,
do
not
govern
the
imposition
of
sentence.
they
instead
provide
a
discretionary
mechanism
for
the
exercise
of
leniency
for
defendants
who
have
already
been
sentenced.
the
district
court
in
this
case
properly
exercised
its
authority
under
the
statute
to
reduce
petitioner's
sentence
by
a
little
bit
more
than
4
years,
which
was
the
maximum
amount
of
reduction
that
was
consistent
with
the
sentencing
commission's
specifications
under
section
994(u)
about
whether
and
to
what
extent
its
crack
cocaine
amendments
warranted
reductions
in
already
imposed
sentences.
the
district
court
had
neither
a
further
obligation
nor
indeed
the
authority
to
set
petitioner's
sentence
aside
altogether
and
resentence
petitioner
under
the
advisory
guidelines
regime
announced
in
booker.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
calculation
error
that
petitioner
is
raising.
section
3582(c)(2)
was
not
designed
by
congress
to
serve
as
effectively
a
less
restrictive
substitute
for
raising
such
challenges
on
direct
appeal
or
where
otherwise
available
under
section
2255.
it
was
instead
designed
for
the
limited
purpose
of
providing
an
opportunity
to
extend
leniency
to
defendants
whose
sentences
are
otherwise
final,
nonappealable
and
therefore
not
subject
to
any
modification.
justice
sotomayor,
you
had
asked
earlier
whether
this
provision
was
designed
as
an
act
of
clemency
or
was
instead
designed
as
a
kind
of
adjunct
to
the
court's
judicial
review
power,
a
kind
of
2255-type
power.
we
think
the
answer
is
clearly
that
it
was
designed
as
a
mechanism
for
the
exercise
of
a
type
of
clemency
power.
i
think
that
is
particularly
clear
if
you
look
at
the
parallel
provisions
in
section
3582(c)(1)
which
are
reprinted
at
pages
3a
and
4a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
those
provisions
also
provide
for
similar
types
of
sentence
reductions
in
cases
where
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
makes
a
motion
for
sentence
reduction
based
either
on
extraordinary
and
compelling
reasons
or
because
the
defendant
is
over
the
age
of
70
and
has
served
more
than
30
years
in
prison.
in
all
of
these
cases
the
district
court
exercises
a
discretionary
power
to
reduce
the
sentence
in
the
exercise
of
leniency,
not
because
of
legal
error
but
for
ethical
reasons.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct,
justice
sotomayor.
we
think
that
what
congress
has
called
for
in
all
of
the
sentence
reduction
provisions
of
section
3582(c)
is
a
kind
of
discretionary
mechanism
for
reducing
sentences
that
are
already
final
and
not
appealable
and
can't
be
modified
in
any
other
respect.
it
hasn't
called
for
a
de
novo
plenary
resentencing.
so
it
allows
defendants
in
the
position
that
petitioner
is
in
to
come
into
court
and
reopen
every
aspect
of
their
sentence,
requiring
reconsideration
of
guidelines
determinations
made
in
this
case
more
than
a
decade
ago
or
requiring
application
of
intervening
changes
in
the
law.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
yes,
it
--
it
was.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think
there
are
two
questions
that
are
raised
here
about
how
this
statutory
scheme
comports
with
booker.
one
is
the
sixth
amendment
question,
whether
this
is
a
statutory
provision
that
calls
for
a
resentencing,
at
which
booker
and
its
decision
about
the
sixth
amendment
would
apply.
and
then
the
second
question
is
even
if
you
think
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
with
reading
the
statute
in
accordance
with
its
plain
terms,
whether
booker's
remedial
analysis
requires
treating
the
reference
to
the
policy
statements
in
section
3582(c)(2)
as
purely
advisory.
we
think
with
respect
to
that
question,
not
even
petitioner
is
quite
willing
to
embrace
the
full
consequences
of
that
argument.
it
would
mean
severing
and
excising
the
portion
of
3582(c)(2)
that
requires
consistency
with
the
applicable
policy.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
it's
a
more
dramatic
change
in
terms
of
the
number
of
case
that
is
would
be
affected,
but
it--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that's
true,
and
it
did
so
in
order
to
solve
the
constitutional
difficulties
that
were
created
by
a
mandatory
guidelines
system
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
sentence.
without
that
same
kind
of
sixth
amendment
violation
in
the
context
of
discretionary
sentence
reduction
proceedings,
we
think
there
is
no
basis
in
booker's
analysis
for
severing
and
excising
any
portion
of
3582(c)(2),
but
i
would
note
that
the
consequence
of
severing
and
excising
the
requirements'
consistency
with
the
applicable
policy
statements
would
be
to
free
district
courts
not
only
from
the
sentencing
commission's
specifications
about
how
much
to
reduce
sentences,
but
also
which
of
its
amendments
to
the
guidelines
would
justify
retroactive
application.
because
it
is
after
all
in
a
policy
statement,
section
1b1.10,
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
specified
which
of
its
amendments,
among
many,
justify
sentence
reductions
under
3582(c)(2).
that
would
mean
that
every
time
the
sentencing
commission
revises
its
guidelines
and
reduces
applicable
sentencing
ranges,
any
number
of
defendants
would
be
free
to
come
to
the
district
courts
and
ask
them
to
make
their
own
independent
judgment
about
whether
or
not
they
should
be
effectively
resentenced
as
a
consequence.
and
that
would
certainly
provide
a
significant
disincentive
for
the
sentencing
commission
ever
to
revise
sentencing
guidelines
in
a
downward
direction.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
there
have
--
there
have
been
many
guidelines,
ranges
that
have
been
reduced
over
the
course
of
the
existence
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
i
believe
that
right
now,
the
current
number
of
--
of
guidelines
amendments
the
sentencing
commission
has
made
retroactive
stands
at
27.
this
was
the
--
one
of
the
first
decisions
that
the
sentencing
commission
made
about
retroactivity
in
the
wake
of
booker,
and
it
did
so
with
full
consciousness
of
the
potential
for
broadly
reopening
sentences.
and
it
certainly
weighed
very
heavily
in
the
sentencing
commission's
deliberations
that
the
traditional
understanding,
existing
long
before
booker
was
ever
decided,
was
that
3582(c)(2)
proceedings
do
not
constitute
plenary
resentencings
that
incorporate
all
intervening
changes
to
the
law.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--and
the
policy
statement
actually
also--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--it's
on
page
--
if
you
look
at
page
8a
of
the
appendix--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--in
the
final
sentence,
it
says,
"in
making
such
determination,
the
court
shall
substitute
only
the
amendments
listed
in
subsection
c
for
the
corresponding
provisions
that
would
apply,
and
shall
leave
all
other
guideline
application
decisions
unaffected.
"
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
do.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
that
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
sentencing
commission's
directive
there.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
the
premise
of
that
question,
i
think,
assumes
two
things.
it
assumes
that
3582(c)(2)
proceedings
are
plenary
sentencings
at
which
booker
applies,
which
the
sentencing
commission,
based
on
a
very
long
history
of
rejections,
precisely--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
if
booker
were
retroactive,
i
think
that
our
position
would
still
be
that
this
is
not
the
proper
vehicle
for
applying
it.
the
proper
vehicle
would
be
to
file
a
motion
for
--
to
vacate
or
set
aside
the
sentence
under
section
2255.
congress
didn't
intend
these
sentence
reduction
proceedings
to
serve
essentially
the
same
purpose.
it
--
it
intended
them
to
serve
simply
the
purpose
of
reducing
otherwise
final,
non-appealable
sentences.
i
would
say--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
you
may
be
working
a
little
hard,
justice
breyer.
i
would
say
that
on
that
point,
we
also
fundamentally
disagree
with
petitioner's
submission
that
there
was
any
error
in
the
calculation
of
his
criminal
history
score
in
1993.
but
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
wanted
to
raise
any
challenges
to
that
determination,
we
think
the
appropriate
time
and
place
to
do
that
would
have
been
on
direct
appeal
of
that
sentencing
decision,
rather
than
waiting
a
decade
and
attempting
to
use
the
3582(c)(2)
proceedings
as
a
kind
of
vehicle
for
collaterally
reopening
that
aspect
of
his
sentence.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
the
district
court
can
consider
any
disciplinary
proceedings
that
have
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
defendant's
imprisonment,
yes.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
mean,
i
think
that
that
certainly
reinforces
the
conclusion
that
i
think
also
arises
from
other
aspects
of
the
provision
that
--
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
not
the
imposition
of
a
brand-new
sentence,
but
simply
a
discretionary
reduction
of
the
old
one.
i
think
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
resolved
by
looking
at
the
plain
text
of
3582(c)(2),
mr.
chief
justice,
which
directs
that
district
courts
have
a
discretion
to
reduce
sentences
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
with
applicable
policy
statements,
but
after
considering
the
statutory
sentencing
factors
under
section
3553(a),
which
includes,
of
course,
the
need
to
protect
the
public
from
future
crimes
committed
by
the
defendant,
as
well
as
the
history
and
characteristics
of
the
prisoner.
the
reference
to
3553(a)
guides
district
courts'
discretion
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
reduction
that's
authorized
by
the
sentencing
commission
in
the
course
of
its
statutory
duty
under
994(u)
to
specify
whether
and
to
what
extent
its
methods
justify
retroactive
application.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
effectively.
i
mean,
it
works
in
both
directions.
it
can
justify
granting
a
reduction;
in
the
case
of
petitioner,
the
district
court
thought
that
the
3553(a)
factors
clearly
pointed
in
favor
of
granting
the
reduction,
but
it
also
--
those
factors
can
work
in
the
direction
of
denying
an
otherwise
available
reduction.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
am
not
aware
of
the
answer
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
it's
certainly
true
that
evidence
of
that
type
of
rehabilitation
factored
into
the
government's
recommendation
in
this
case
that
petitioner--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
speak
to
that
question
today,
justice
kennedy.
i
can
tell
you
that
the
government
very
much
takes
those
considerations
into
account
in
making
recommendations
about
available
sentence
reductions
under
section
3582(c)(2).
and
indeed,
in
this
case,
the
government
agreed
that
the
petitioner
should
receive
the
full
measure
of
the
benefit
that
the
sentencing
commission
had
made
available
when
it
decided
to
make
the
crack
cocaine
amendments
retroactive,
based
in
large
part
on
petitioner's
conduct
in
presenting
and
his
other
characteristics.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
the
reason
why
the
commission
doesn't
do
that
is
because
it
wouldn't
comply
with
its
statutory
mandate
under
29
u.s.c.
994(u)
to
specify
both
which
guidelines
amendments
justify
retroactive
application
and
the
amount
by
which
sentences
may
be
reduced.
the
sentencing
commission
would
have
no
power
to
simply
say
in
its
policy
statement:
district
courts,
you
are
free
to
reduce
sentences
by
however
much
amount
you
believe
is
appropriate.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
the
statute
would
have
prohibited
such
a
policy
statement.
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
answer
is
simply
that
the
3553(a)
factors
and
their
consideration
under
3582(c)(2)
is
designed
for
a
different
purpose
than
for
the
consideration
that
goes
into
the
initial
imposition
of
the
sentence.
the
point
of
considering
the
3553(a)
factors,
to
the
extent
they
are
applicable
to
use
the
words
of
3582(c)(2),
is
to
just
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
district
court
will
grant
a
reduction
that
is
authorized
to
the
extent
it
is
authorized
by
applicable
policy
statements.
it
is
not
to
determine
whether
the
resulting
sentence,
as
an
original
matter,
is
greater
than
necessary
to
comport
with
the
statutory
sentencing
factors.
it's
simply
for
the
limited
purpose
of
deciding
whether
to
exercise
discretion
to
reduce
the
sentence
in
a
manner
that
is
authorized
by
the
statute.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it's
a
factor
that
would
cause
you
to
permit
the
reduction,
presumably.
it's
one
of
the
many
considerations
that
a
district
court
can
take
into
account
in
deciding
that
it
will,
in
fact,
exercise
its
discretion
to
reduce
the
sentence
to
the
extent
that
that
is
permitted
by
congress
and
applicable
policy
statements.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct.
it
can
point
in
either
direction
in
any
given
case.
but
the
critical
point
is
that
congress
has
set
the
parameters
for
the
district
court's
exercise
of
discretion
in
these
proceedings.
whatever
the
district
court
chooses
to
do
has
to
be
consistent
with
applicable
policy
statements,
including
the
commission's
policy
statement
in
which
its
implemented
its
statutory
authority
to
specify
whether
and
to
what
extent
its
guidelines
amendments
will
justify
retroactive
application.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
