ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
believing
its
hands
were
tied
by
a
policy
statement
created
to
prevent
application
of
this
court's
decision
in
booker
to
section
3582(c)
proceedings,
the
district
court
imposed
a
mandatory
guideline
sentence
that
exceeded
the
maximum
authorized
by
the
jury's
verdict
by
more
than
six
years.
sentencing
commission
policy
cannot
override
this
court's
clear
and
unambiguous
directive
to
courts
to
treat
the
guidelines
as
advisory
in
all
cases
moving
forward,
and
any
interpretation
of
section
3582(c)
that
permits
the
commission
to
mandate
sentences
must
be
rejected,
not
only
as
matter
of
statutory
stare
decisis,
but
because
it
would
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
in
an
effort
to
avoid
this
result,
the
government
elevates
form
over
substance,
arguing
that
section
3582(c)
proceedings
are
not
sentencings
at
the
--
and
that
the
sentence
imposed
is
not
a
new
sentence.
the
government
is
wrong.
section
3582(c)
proceedings
are
sentencings
at
which
booker's
constitutional
and
remedial
holdings
must
apply.
the--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
would
present
precisely
the
same
problems
here.
by
indicating
an
amount
of
time
that
a
sentence
could
be
reduced,
the
sentencing
commission
would
still
be
doing
precisely
what
it
did
here,
which
is
setting
a
lower
level,
mandatory
lower
level,
on
sentences
that
the
district
court
could
impose.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
i
disagree,
your
honor,
because
congress
in
this
case
decided
to
enact
a
statute,
3582(c),
that
invokes
the
discretionary
sentencing
power
of
the
court.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
and,
your
honor,
perhaps
i
misunderstood,
but
once
the
sentencing
commission
acts
to
revise
a
guideline
under
its
power
under
994(u)
and
opts
to
make
that
amendment
retroactive
under
--
i
mean
994(o)
--
and
opts
to
make
it
retroactive
under
994(u),
only
the
court
has
power
to
lower
a
sentence.
congress
in--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--and
justice
--
justice
kennedy,
i
think
there
would
be.
and
again,
i
don't
mean
to
be
dodging
the
question.
the
problem
is
section
3582(c).
congress
clearly
indicated
that
it
wanted
these
types
of
reductions
to
be
treated
differently
than
those
under
3624(b),
which
are
delegated
to
the
bureau
of
prisons.
and
those
types
of
reductions--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--your
honor
--
your
honor,
if
congress
chose
to
draft
a
statute
similar
to
3624(b)
to
empower
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
act
whenever
the
commission
lowered
a
guideline
or
--
or
changed
a
guideline
under
994(o),
i
agree
with
your
honor.
it
would
not
present
the
problems
here.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
the
difference,
again
--
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
dodging
your
questions.
the
difference
is
that
congress
acted
in
two
very
different
ways
here.
it
enacted
3582(c)
to
deal
with
reductions
in
sentence
that
are
--
that
are
prompted
by
revisions
to
the
guidelines,
and
it
enacted
3624(b)
to
deal
with
revisions
that
are
prompted
by
good
behavior.
and
the--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
the
difference
would
be
that
when
it
is
delegated
to
the
courts
under
a
statute
like
3582(c),
the
court
is
then
dealing
with
a
mandatory
guideline
range,
and
the
sixth
amendment
problem
arises
when
the
court
sentences
the--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--justice
sotomayor,
i
disagree
with
the
premise
of
your
question
that
this
is
an
act
of
clemency
similar
to
the
reductions
for
good
time
behavior.
the
--
the
term
"clemency",
"leniency",
"grace",
connotes
the
idea
that
you
deserve
to
be
punished
for
this,
but
we
are
going
to
--
we
are
going
to
exercise
leniency--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--justice
ginsburg,
i
have
a
couple
of
responses
to
your
question.
the
first
is
that
i
think
that
a
decision
by
a
district
court
judge
to
correct
a
sentence
under
3582(c)
should
be
analogous
to
a
decision
of
a
district
court
judge
to
correct
a
sentence
under
2255.
once
the
decision
is
made
that
the
sentence
should
be
corrected,
finality
is
extinguished;
and
when
the
court
goes
about
imposing
the
new
sentence,
it
must
comport
with
the
law
of
the
land
at
the
time.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
and,
your
honor,
once
the
finality
bar
is
lifted,
the
concerns
about
retroactivity
should
slip
away.
but
with
respect
to
fairness,
which
i
think
is
at
the
heart
of
your
question,
the
fact
that
this
partial
remedy
for
an
urgent
and
compelling
problem,
that
is,
the
crack
guideline,
was
afforded
to
some
should
not
prevent
the
court
from
seeing
justice
for
those
like
mr.
dillon,
even
though
there
are
some
in
prison
that
are
serving
unconstitutional
sentences
that
will
not
be
able
to
seek
relief.
mr.
dillon
is
properly
compared
to
other
defendants
who
are
sentenced
under
the
amended
crack
guideline,
not
the
original
crack
guideline.
his
sentence
is
an
amended
crack
guideline
sentence,
and
for
purposes
of
avoiding
unwarranted
disparities
mr.
dillon
is
most
comparable
to
those
other
defendants
that
are
sentenced
after
the
crack
guideline.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
your
honor,
i
would
certainly
hope
not.
994
clearly
contemplates
that
the
commission
will
undertake
a
constant
review
and
revision
of
the
guidelines
to
make
sure
that
they
serve
the
purposes
of
punishment.
and
994(u)clearly
shows
that
congress
contemplated
that
some
of
those
decisions
would
warrant
retroactive
application.
if
the
commission
were
to
respond
to
a
decision
by
this
court
in
mr.
dillon's
favor
by
refusing
to
revise
the
guidelines
in
the
future
or
refusing
to
make
any
of
those
revisions
retroactive,
i
submit
that
it
would
be
abdicating
its
duty
under
994.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
you
are
right,
your
honor.
it
just
wouldn't
do
that,
but
history
would
speak
for
itself.
the
commission
has
constantly
undertaken
this
duty
under
994.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
well,
your
honor--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--your
honor,
if
i
could,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
commission
close
its
eyes
to
anything.
however,
what
we
are
asking
for
in
this
case
is
not
a
full
resentencing
where
all
sentencing
decisions
would
be
reopened.
we
are
simply
saying
that
when
a
court
imposes
a
new
sentence,
that
new
sentence
must
comply
with
this
court's
decision
in
booker.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
and
that
means--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--your
honor,
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
is.
the--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--the
sentence
imposed
would
have
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that's
the
case
in
any
situation
where
a
defendant
has
raised
an
issue
on
appeal
or
has
presented
a
claim
in
a
2255
petition,
and
just
by
happenstance
the
decision
awarding
them
a
new
--
a
new
trial
or
a
new
sentence
happens
when
a
new
constitutional
rule
is
announced
by
this
court.
now--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--and
again,
your
honor,
i
think
that
he
would
get
to
raise
it,
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
not
every
constitutional
issue
would
be
ripe
for
the
court's
decision
at
that
proceeding.
if
there
were
an
opportunity
to
raise
--
as
you
said,
equal
protection
is
not
a
new
law
as
we
are
talking
about
booker
being
a
new
law
for
mr.
--
for
mr.
dillon.
if
there
were
an
equal
protection
challenge
that
had
not
been
lodged
at
the
original
sentencing,
the
district
court
would
apply
the
law
of
the
case
and--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
must
have
misspoken.
that
is
certainly
not
what
i
meant
to
indicate.
what
i
meant
to
say
is,
certainly,
all
sentences
imposed
ought
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
but
we
live
in
a
system
that
has
waiver
principles,
law
of
the
case,
mandate
rule.
these
are
all
obstacles
that
a
defendant
seeking
to
overturn
a
sentencing
or
raise
an
issue
on
equal
protection
grounds
that
weren't
presented
before
would
serve
as
obstacles
to
their
doing
so.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
i
disagree,
your
honor,
that
my
theory
does
not
encompass
that
part
of
the
rule.
and
i
think
with
respect
to
our
criminal
history
issue
that
we
have
raised
that
is
precisely
what
we
said.
that
there
are
errors
that
a
district
court
may
not
be
able
to
correct
in
a
3582(c)(2)--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
law
of
the
case
were
in
place
before
booker
was
decided,
the
new
law
would
be
an
exception
to
the
law
of
the
case
if
mr.
dillon
were
resentenced
as
he
were
after
the
court's
decision
in
booker.
i'm
not
sure
if
that
answers
your
question
precisely.
for
mr.
dillon,
booker
is
new
law
at
his
new
sentencing.
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
raise
a
booker
objection
or
ask
for
a
sentence
below
the
guideline
range
at
his
original
sentencing.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
well,
under
3582(c),
your
honor,
the
statute
--
the
statute
provides
that--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--your
honor,
i
think
we
want
the
whole
statute,
the
statute--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--your
honor--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--i
think
i
understand
your
point.
the
--
the
problem
is
with
the
statute.
3582(c)
does
not
authorize
a
court
to
increase
the
sentence.
the
fact
that
a
sentence
cannot
be
increased
does
not
divest
the
proceeding
by
which
it
is
imposed.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
your
honor,
post-booker
what
violates
the
constitution
is
the
policy
statement's
use
of
the
word
"shall".
that's
a
--
that's
a
significant
change
in--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--your
honor,
in
our
view
3582(c)
is
not
unconstitutional.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
justice
breyer,
post-booker
if
3582(c)
is
interpreted
as
you
just
said,
that
the
sentence
--
the
reduction
in
sentence
must
be
consistent
with
a
particular
policy
statement--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--and
that
the
--
and
that
the
policy
statement
then
requires
the
court
to
impose
a
mandatory
guideline
sentence--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--the
constitution
--
your
honor,
if
i
could,
the
constitutional
problem
with
section
1b1.10(b)(2)(a)
is
that
it
requires
the
district
court
to
impose
a
sentence
within
the
guideline
range.
therein
lies
the
problem.
the
requirement,
a
mandatory
guideline
sentence
based
on
a
judicially
enhanced
range,
therein
lies
the
problem.
section
3582(c)
does
not
mandate
guidelines
sentencing.
it's
1b1.10.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
your
honor,
if
i
could,
if
a
judge
is
presented
with
a
3582(c)
motion
and
denies
the
motion,
all
the
court
has
done
is
enter
an
order
denying
a
motion.
it's
not
until
the
district
court
decides
to
grant
the
3582(c)
motion
and
reduce
the
defendant's
sentence
that
3553(a)
factors
come
into
play,
the
policy
statements
come
into
play,
and
a
new
sentence
is
thereafter
imposed.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
justice
ginsburg--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct.
and
the
reason
is
because
3582(c)
is
a
provision
that
is
used
by
courts
to
correct
sentences.
once
the
court
decides
that
the
defendant
is
worthy
of
a
correction,
that
the
sentence
should
be
corrected,
it
grants
a
motion
extinguishing
the
old
sentence
and
imposes
a
new
sentence.
our
position
is
simply
that
when
it
imposes
the
new
sentence,
it
must
comply
with
booker's
constitutional
and
remedial
holdings.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
please,
justice
scalia.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
i
agree.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
i
agree.
and,
justice
breyer--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--and,
justice
breyer,
i
apologize
because
i
may
not
be--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--i
may
not
be
understanding
your
question.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
okay.
i
would
like
to--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--okay,
thank
you.
[laughter]
a
couple
of
points,
though,
that
i
--
that
--
from
reading
the
text
of
the
statute
that
i
would
like
to
point
out.
justice
breyer,
notice
it
doesn't
say
"sentence".
it
says
"term
of
imprisonment".
"term
of
imprisonment"
is
--
is
a
term
of
art
in
the
federal
code.
the
3551
of
the
united
states
code.
and
under
3621,
the
bureau
of
prisons
cannot
hold
someone
in
custody
absent
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
and
in
this
case
there
are
two
judgments,
two
sentences
of
imprisonment.
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
not
have
been
able
to
hold
mr.
dillon
for
270
months
under
the
1993
judgment,
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
certainly
cannot
hold
mr.
dillon
for
322
months
under
the
--
the
june--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--under
3621
it's
very
clear
that
the
--
the
bureau
of
prisons,
absent
a
reduction
under
3624(b)
for
good
time,
is
directed
to
hold
the
defendant
in
the
custody
of
bureau
of
prisons
for
the
term
of
imprisonment
on
the
judgment.
in
this
case,
following
the--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--justice
scalia,
i'm
certain
that
that's
not
true.
and
i
mean
there
--
i
am
not
familiar--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--with
this
provision.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
and
again,
your
honor,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
clemency
and
commutation
procedures.
i
would
have
to
think
that
some
piece
of
paper,
some
order
directing
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
reduce
the
sentence,
just
as
a
new
judgment
in
a
3582(c)
is
a
new
sentence
of
270
months,
would
have
to
be
presented
so
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
release.
but
--
but
that
aside,
the
--
the
real
point
here
is
that
the
new
judgment
is
a
new
judgment;
it
is
a
new
sentence.
this
is
not
a
reduction
in
the
old
sentence.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
i
agree.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
your
honor,
the
--
the
practice
in
the
court
of
appeals
post-booker
of
remanding
all
of
the
cases
that
were
in
the
pipeline
shows
that
the
federal
courts
are
able
to
handle
revisiting
thousands
of
sentences
imposed
under
a
mandatory
system
to
revisit
them
under
3353(a).
and
as
justice
walton
said
in
testifying
before
the
sentencing
commission
with
respect
to
this
issue,
that
the
courts
are
fully
prepared
to
handle
any
administrative
burden
and
believes
that
such
a
burden
would
be
sufficiently
justified
for
people
like
mr.
dillon
who
are
deserving.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
(b)
does
apply
to
(c),
your
honor,
and
i'm
glad
that
you
raised
that
because
3582(b)
is
significant
in
that
it
does
not
distinguish
the
effect
of
finality
of
remands,
modifications
under
3582(c);
it's
the
judgment
of
conviction
--
the
conviction
that
remains
final.
the
sentence
is
no
longer
final.
it's
modified
under
any
of
the
provisions
listed
in
3582(b).
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
how
many
minutes?
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
three
minutes,
thank
you.
a
couple
of
points.
i
wanted
to
answer
justice
kennedy's
question.
the
court
is
not
only
permitted
to
consider
bad
behavior
in
prison,
under
1b1.10,
the
court
is
required.
the
word
is
"shall".
and,
so,
all
of
these
things
and
many
of
your
questions
point
to
the
fact
that
this
is
an
adversarial
proceeding.
section
3582(c)
describes
a
sentencing.
it
requires
the
court
to
consider
all
of
the
3553(a)
factors.
it
requires
the
court
to
be
consistent
with
policy
statements.
it
requires
a
court
to
impose
a
new
sentence.
and
the
word
3582(c)
connotes
correction,
not
leniency,
not
grace.
those
are
functions
of
the
executive
branch,
not
of
the
judicial
branch.
and
in
this
context
the
court
decided
after
the
commission
reduced
the
sentencing
--
the
sentencing
guidelines
for
crack
offenders,
that
a
correction
was
warranted.
there
was
an
error
in
the
prior
sentence
that
3582(c)
permitted
the
district
court
to
correct,
and
when
it
imposed
a
new
sentence,
that
new
sentence
has
to
comport
with
current
law.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
justice
ginsburg
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
justice
ginsburg,
your
hypothetical,
the
court
is
imposing
a
sentence
or
conditions
of
a
sentence,
and
once
those
conditions
have
been
met,
the
defendant
is
relieved,
just
as
when
the
conditions
of
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
have
been
met,
the
defendant
is
released
from
prison.
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
get
back
to,
because
there
were
many
questions
about
it,
is
this
consistent
with
policy
statements.
policy
statements
by
definition
do
not
bind.
the
sentencing
commission
in
this
case
changed
the
1b1.10
to
say
that
the
sentencing
court
could
not,
shall
not
impose
a
sentence
below
the
guideline
range.
1b1.10
for
all
of
the
26
retroactive
amendments
that
preceded
the
crack
amendment
read
district
courts
should
sentence
within
the
amended
guideline
range,
and
that
is
appropriately
a
policy
statement.
1b1.10(b)(2)(a)
is
not
a
policy
statement.
it
purports
to
be
a
binding
rule.
and
as
this
court
knows,
policy
statements
do
not
bind.
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
when
congress
says
consistent
with
policy
statements
--
and,
your
honor,
i
would
direct
you
--
i
see
my
red
light
is
on,
if
i
could
finish--
ms.
lisa
b.
freeland
--i
would
direct
you
to
the
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
defenders
at
pages
23
and
24
and
our
reply
brief
at
pages
25
and

ms.

you
very
much.
