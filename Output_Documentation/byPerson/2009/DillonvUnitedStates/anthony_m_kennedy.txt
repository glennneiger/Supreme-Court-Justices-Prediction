justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that?
it's
the
same
hypothetical
of
the
chief
justice.
i'm
not
interrupting
your
--
your
discussion
with
him.
suppose,
pursuant
to
permissible
regulation,
the
bop
says:
just
file
paperwork
with
us,
and
if
--
and
if
you
show
that
you
were
under
a
crack
cocaine
sentence,
you
are
going
to
be
reduced
by
x
number
of
months,
period.
just
file
it.
what
--
is
there
a
problem
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
--
the
hypothetical
is
congress
doesn't
do
this.
the
hypothetical
is
that
congress
just
tells
the
bop:
find
out
who's
in
on
crack
cocaine
and
release
them
--
whatever,
20
months
early.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
then
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
at
least
for
me,
meant:
what
--
why
should
there
be
a
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
will
make
this
brief
because
your
--
your
rebuttal
light
is
on.
your
answer
made
sense
when
we
talk
about
term
as
opposed
to
sentence,
if
you
just
look
at
(c).
but
(b)
says
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
sentence
to
imprisonment
can
be
modified
--
a
judgment
or
conviction
that
includes
such
a
sentence
constitutes
a
final
judgment.
does
(b)
not
apply
to
(c)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
the
judge
considers
the
adjustment
motion
under
the
--
under
the
section,
does
he
consider
how
the
prisoner
has
behaved
in
prison;
i.e.,
if
he
has
behaved
very
badly,
he
doesn't
give
the
--
the
reduction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he
--
but
he
cannot
go
below.
the
--
the
petitioner
makes
the
argument
metaphysically
that
there
is
just
a
new
sentence.
in
your
view,
is
that
refuted
by
the
language
of
(c)(2)
because
they
talk
about
an
occasion
of
a
defendant
who
has
been
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment,
and
then
they
say
the
term
can
be
reduced,
and
it
doesn't
use
the
words
"a
new
sentence
shall
be
imposed?
"
i
assume
that
is
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
one-way
ratchet?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
petitioner's
brief
opens
with
a
statement
about
his
rehabilitation.
we
don't
know
if
that
has
been
contested.
you
don't
respond
to
it.
but
let's
assume
that's
all
true.
he
established
schools
and
he
helped
young
people
and
so
forth.
does
the
justice
department
ever
make
recommendations
that
prisoners
like
this
have
their
sentence
commuted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
isn't
the
population
of
prisoners
in
the
federal
prisons
about
185,000
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
is.
and
how
many
commutations
last
year?
none.
how
many
commutations
the
year
before?
five.
does
this
show
that
something
is
not
working
in
the
system?
185,000
prisoners?
i
think
that
is
the
number.
