justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
--
what's
the
--
the
words
in
the
statute
is
that
it
may
reduce
the
term.
you
cannot
change
the
term
--
you
cannot
change
a
sentence,
except
that
you
can
reduce
the
term
if
such
reduction
is
consistent
with
applicable
policy
statements.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
see
anything
--
what's
--
what's
unconstitutional
about
that?
then
they
issue
a
policy
statement,
and
the
policy
statement
says
you
can't
reduce
it
except
insofar
as
our
new
--
whatever
the
new
thing
is
--
applies.
if
you
are
arguing
that
that
violates
the
constitution,
what
i
am
missing
is,
why?
what
violates
the
constitution
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
remember.
i
thought
in
booker
--
and
i
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
it,
but
i
thought
in
booker
the
court
held
that
certain
specific
--
like
certain
specific
words
in
certain
specific
provisions
of
the
--
the
sentencing
statutes
were
unconstitutional
because
of
apprendi
and
because
of
the
other
part
of
booker
itself.
well,
3582
wasn't
one
of
them.
so
--
so
there
must
be
something
unconstitutional.
if
you
are
right,
i
don't
see
how
you
get
around
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
it's
not
unconstitutional,
then
why
don't
you
have
to
follow
it?
because
what
it
says
is,
you
cannot
get
a
reduction
except
in
respect
to
what
the
policy
guideline
says.
and
the
policy
guideline
says
you
don't
get
a
reduction,
except
insofar
as
we
have
reduced
a
sentence
in
a
particular
respect.
what's
unconstitutional
about
that?
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
there
isn't.
i
want
to
know
what
your
argument
is
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
says.
i
don't
know
how
you
would
interpret
it
some
other
way
if
that's
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
just
says
what
we're
doing
is
we
are
reopening
the
sentencing
in
respect
to
the
particular
way
we
reduce
people's
sentence,
not
in
respect
to
something
else.
that's
what
i
read
the
policy
statement
to
say.
that
if
there
were
19
things
that
were
considered
in
the
sentence
and
one
of
those
19
is
changed
in
a
downward
direction,
then
it
says
we
make
an
exception,
says
the
policy
statement.
you
can
reopen
no.
19,
but
not
the
first
18.
now,
why
is
that
unconstitutional?
what
in
the
constitution
prohibits
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
agree.
now
--
now,
what
--
that's
what
i
--
i
could
understand
that
if
3582
said
to
the
judge
you
resentence
him.
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
so
there
is
a
sentence
in
effect,
and
what
3582
says
is
a
--
a
sentence
can
be
reduced
just
as
if,
to
go
back
to
the
beginning,
congress
passed
a
statute
or
the
commission
said
everybody's
sentence
will
be
reduced.
that
doesn't
change
what
the
sentence
was.
it
says
there
is
a
reduction,
like
for
good
--
good
time.
so
it
says
a
defendant,
if
he
has
been
sentenced
based
on
factor
19
in
the
case,
the
court
may
reduce
the
term
of
imprisonment,
the
term
of
imprisonment
there
under
the
sentence.
so
i'm
back
to
my
question.
what
is
unconstitutional
about
that?
and
what
the
court
just
says
is
the
court
--
the
commission
says,
that's
right.
you
may
reduce
it
in
respect
to
what
we
have
considered.
you
may
not
reduce
it
in
respect
to
something
which
is
not
considered.
so
i'm
still
puzzled
about
the
constitutional
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
you
don't
have
to
apologize.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
your
argument
now.
and
i
didn't
quite
and
i
do.
so
there
is
nothing
to
apologize
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
wanted
to
get
the
idea
in
my
mind.
i'm
not
expressing
that
in
my
question,
but
i
got
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
what
it
says.
the
other
thing
that
is
bothering
me,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
is
--
is
the
part
of
the
point
that
was
brought
up
previously
that
it
is
up
to
the
commission
whether
to
make
it
retroactive.
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
know
why
they
couldn't
take
into
account
that
to
make
any
drug-related
change,
you
see,
and
then
make
that
retroactive,
is
going
to
reopen
the
sentencing
for
every
single
person
who
has
already
been
convicted
of
a
drug
crime
in
the
federal
courts,
of
which
there
are
probably
tens
of
thousands.
and
--
and
i
think
they
would
properly
take
that
into
account.
and,
therefore,
they
might
properly
say,
we're
not
going
to
make
this
retroactive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
--
can
i
ask
you
a
different
question
on
the
secondary
argument
that
they
make?
when
i
read
the
secondary
argument,
that
there
was
an
error
in
the
calculation
of
the
guidelines
and
she
would
like
to
have
that
error
corrected,
i
didn't
see
anything
in
the
policy
statement
that
would
prevent
her
from
getting
that
correction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
in
the
policy
statement?
because
what
it
says
is:
what
you're
supposed
to
do
is
judge;
you
go
and
look
at
the
guidelines
that
were
applied.
now,
substitute
the
new
one
reducing
the
sentence
for
the
old
one,
and
then
go
apply
it.
and
therefore,
that
seems
to
me
not
to
block
a
claim
that
would
say,
when
you
apply
these
guidelines
with
the
new
one
substituted
for
the
old
one,
apply
them;
that
is,
if,
in
fact,
there
was
an
error
the
first
time.
now,
she
may
have
a
hard
time
showing
that,
but
if
she
can
show
it,
what
in
the
words
that
are
right
there
in
(b)(1)
stops
her
from
getting
that
correction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
it.
i
have
it
in
front
of
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
other
guideline
application
decisions,
their
claim
is
that
they
just
made
an
error,
like
a
clerical
error,
a
clear
error,
manifest
injustice,
in
that
first
math.
do
you
think
that
this
would
leave
them
unaffected?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
have
thought
the
objection
to
that
is:
no,
they
didn't
make
a
mistake
in
applying
booker,
because
this
court
has
said
that
booker
isn't
retroactive.
and
of
course,
they
did
make
a
mistake
if
it
is
retroactive.
and
then
the
court
should
have
said,
it
is
retroactive,
in
which
case
there
would
be
no
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
my
word
was:
it
shall
leave
all
other
guideline
application
decisions.
well,
that's
--
that's
--
their
claim
is
not
that
the
guideline
--
it's
that
they
--
they
chose
the
wrong
guideline
or
they
didn't
apply
the
right
words.
you
see,
so
they
weren't
applying
that
--
they
just
applied
the
wrong
thing.
now
you
say
i'm
working
too
hard.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
they
do
if
congress
says
they
do.
