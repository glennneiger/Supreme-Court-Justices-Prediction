justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
freeland,
may
i
take
you
on
another
path,
not
the
question
of
the
difference
between
the
two
--
two
sections.
you
have
a
large
prison
population,
and
then
booker
comes
down,
and
then
the
guidelines
change
only
as
to
crack
cocaine,
nothing
else.
all
of
the
others
whose
sentence
has
become
final
cannot
get
into
the
court's
door
because
they
don't
have
the
entering
wedge.
in
what
system
--
what
fair
system
would
say,
aha,
because
the
crack
cocaine
guideline
was
reduced
--
the
disparity
was
reduced
--
these
people
are
now
going
to
overcome
the
finality
bar,
but
all
of
the
others
who
are
identically
situated
with
respect
to
all
other
factors,
they
don't
get
their
sentences
revised?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
should,
bearing
in
mind
that
entire
prison
population
similarly
situated,
the
courts
say
the
finality
bar
is
lifted
only
to
the
extent
that
the
crack
cocaine
guideline
disparity
has
been
reduced?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
--
if
you
are
right
that
this
benefit
goes
to
--
only
to
the
classic
can
you
get
in
the
door,
wouldn't
that
be
a
powerful
motive
to
the
sentencing
commission
not
to
make
its
guidelines
reductions
retroactive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
freeland,
what
would
happen
if
the
--
the
motion
is
made
with
respect
to
the
crack
cocaine,
and
the
judge
said,
i'm
--
i'm
not
going
to
--
i
deny
the
motion.
would
the
judge
then
have
to
go
on
and
consider
booker
and
say,
on
this
speech,
i
deny
the
motion,
but
now
i
can
just
do
whatever
i
want
with
the
rest
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
--
suppose
congress
and
the
sentencing
commission
had
made
it
crystal
clear
that
they
are
authorizing
a
reopening
but
only
with
respect
to
one
piece.
you
say
--
you
say
no
matter
how
clear
it
is,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
because
booker
has
been
decided,
the
whole
sentence
is
up
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--consideration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
extend
to
--
which
was
part
of
this
case
--
the
court
notices
that
there
was
a
technical
error;
it
was
a
calculation
error
the
first
time,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
i
will
fix
that
up,
too.
that
was
an
arithmetic
error?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there
been
other
guidelines
ranges
that
have
been
reduced,
and
if
so
were
those
also
retroactive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
told
me
--
i
asked
you
that
question,
and
you
told
me
it
could
not
be
corrected,
because
everything
was
final.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
get
you
to
go
back?
you
said
something
that
only
the
executive
can
grant
clemency.
what
--
what
about
a
program
where
a
district
court
judge
says
i'm
going
to
have
this
person
undergo
a
course
--
a
drug
addiction
course,
and
if
the
defendant
successfully
passes
the
course,
then
i
will
give
a
lighter
sentence?
that
--
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
your
answer
exclude
that
--
that
possibility?
