what
is
the
constitutional
difference
that
would
ignore
a
sixth
amendment
right
in
the
resentencing
by
the
court
that
doesn't
when
it's
a
resentencing
or
a
modification
of
a
sentence
by
the
bureau
of
prisons?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
is
this
truly
a
new
sentence
--
meaning
a
person
serving
a
sentence,
this
is
an
act
of
clemency.
whether
the
bureau
of
prisons
does
it
or
the
court
does
it,
why
should
we
introduce
a
different
binding
or
non-binding
constitutional
limit
on
one
body
rather
than
the
other?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
your
theory
there
is
no
bar
to
an
upward
sentence
by
the
--
by
the
judge,
because
if
it's
a
brand
new
hearing
subject
to
booker,
which
mandates
complete
discretion
under
3553,
the
judges
define
the
sentence
that
fits
the
crime
and
the
defendant.
so
you
don't
mind
an
upward--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
only
want
part
of
the
statute,
not
the
whole
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
want
the
whole
statute,
then
it's
a
new
sentence.
you
can't
--
and
say
the
statute
limits
up
and
down,
but
i
only
want
the
down,
and
i
want
a
new
sentence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
gets
tied
up,
doesn't
it,
to
your
argument
that
this
is
not
a
part
of
the
criminal
prosecution,
that
this
is
--
not
a
sixth
amendment
proceeding,
but
some
--
not
a
sixth
amendment
proceeding,
so
it
doesn't
require
constitutional
protection?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
1993,
petitioner
percy
dillon
was
convicted
of
among
other
things,
crack
cocaine
offenses
and
was
sentenced
to
322
months
imprisonment.
roughly
fifteen
years
later,
the
sentencing
commission
amended
the
crack
cocaine
guidelines
by
lowering
them
and
it
made
the
amendments
retroactive.
dillon
then
moved
for
sentence
reduction
under
18
usc
code
section
3582
(c)
(2).
that
provision
authorizes
a
district
court
to
reduce
an
otherwise
final
sentence
pursuant
to
a
guideline
amendment
if
a
reduction
is
consistent
with
the
commission's
policy
statements.
the
relevant
policy
statement
found
in
section
1b1.10
of
the
guidelines
manual
precludes
a
court
from
reducing
a
sentence
to
a
term
that
is
less
than
the
minimum
of
the
amended
guidelines
range
except
in
circumstances
not
applicable
here.
dillon
nevertheless
asked
the
district
court
to
impose
a
sentence
below
the
amended
range,
contending
that
our
decision
in
united
states
versus
booker
which
made
the
guidelines
advisory
requires
court
to
treat
section
1b110
as
nonbinding.
he
also
asked
the
court
to
correct
certain
alleged
errors
in
his
original
sentence
that
are
unrelated
to
the
guidelines
amendment.
the
district
court
imposed
a
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
the
revised
guideline
range
but
declined
to
grant
the
further
reduction.
finding
booker
inapplicable
to
section
3582(c)(2),
the
court
concluded
that
section
1b110
constrained
it
to
impose
a
sentence
within
the
amended
range.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
address
bookers'
applicability
to
section
3582
(c)
(2)
proceedings.
dillon
contends
that
proceedings
under
that
section
are
essentially
plenary
re-sentencing
proceedings
and
that
booker's
holdings
therefore
apply.
the
text
and
purpose
of
the
statute
belay
that
claim.
section
3582
(c)
(2)
represents
a
congressional
act
of
lenity
intended
to
give
prisoners
the
benefit
of
later
enacted
guidelines
amendments.
the
authority
of
the
courts
acting
under
section
3582
(c)
(2)
is
substantially
constrained
by
the
commission
which
is
charged
with
determining
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
guidelines
amendment
is
retroactive.
by
statute,
the
court
may
exercise
discretion
to
reduce
a
prisoner
sentence
only
to
the
extent
consistent
with
the
commission's
statements.
in
light
of
these
unique
constraints,
it
is
clear
that
proceedings
authorized
under
section
3582
(c)
(2)
are
not
re-sentencing
proceedings.
for
the
reasons
elaborated
in
our
opinion
issued
today
we
hold
that
treating
section
(1)
(b)
110
as
binding
in
these
circumstances
implicates
neither
the
sixth
amendment
nor
remedial
interest
that
issue
in
booker.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
justice
alito
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
the
court.
