justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
say
that.
it
just
wouldn't
do
it.
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
certainly
a
factor
that
if
i
were
--
if
i
were
on
the
commission,
i
would
certainly
take
that
factor
into
account.
every
time
i
make
it
retroactive,
it
is
going
to
reopen
--
it
is
going
to
reopen
the
whole
sentencing
and
--
and
allow
a
booker
application
where
--
where
it
didn't
apply
before.
how
can
i
close
my
eyes
to
that
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
i
am
making
the
retroactivity
determination?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
pick
on
--
on
booker
as
--
as
not
carrying
over?
i
mean
if
you
say
that
there
carries
over
from
the
prior
sentencing
his
failure
to
raise
the
equal
protection
claim,
why
can't
you
say
it's
also
law
of
the
case
that
the
booker
objection
doesn't
stand?
it's
all
the
case.
it
was
decided
before
booker,
and
that's
the
law
of
the
case
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
a
better
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
you
want
my
better
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
[laughter]
it's
--
it's
--
it's
not
--
it's
not
section
3582
that
is
unconstitutional,
and
it
isn't
even
the
provision
for
being
guided
by
a
policy
statement
of
the
sentencing
commission
that's
unconstitutional.
it
is
the
nature
of
the
sentencing
commission's
policy
statement
that
is
unconstitutional.
surely,
if
the
sentencing
commission
had
a
policy
statement
which
said
you
will
reduce
it
for
white
prisoners
but
not
for
black
prisoners,
that
would
surely
be
unconstitutional,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
point
here
is
that
the
policy
statement
which
says
you
effectively
will
disregard
booker
is
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
works,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
if
the
president
reduces
the
sentence
using
his
pardoning
power?
he
cuts
it
back;
he
cuts
it
in
half.
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
to
hold
him
for
the
full
term
of
the
imprisonment?
no,
that
can't
be
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
this
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
this
any
different?
i
mean
there
are
obviously
--
what
it
proves
is
that
there
are
exceptions
to
that
requirement
that
they
hold
him
for
the
term
of
imprisonment.
they
--
they
have
to
hold
him
for
the
term
of
imprisonment
unless
it
has
been
shortened,
right,
by
--
by
pardon
or
remission
of
part
of
the
term
by
the
president
or
what
the
argument
for
the
government
is,
or
by
application
of
this
retroactive
rule
by
--
by
the
commission.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
they
also
made
a
mistake
in
not
applying
booker,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
still
don't
understand
how
you
fit
into
that
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
earlier
that,
in
fact,
the
court
can
consider
other
factors
in
--
in
3553(a)
when
it's
making
the
reduction.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
but
--
but
i
thought
you
said
you
could
take
into
account
good
behavior
in
that
determination?
but
that
isn't
a
factor
--
that
isn't
a
factor
that
would
cause
you
had
to
disallow
the
reduction.
it's
a
factor--
