justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
3582(c)
was
enacted
prior
to
our
decision
in
booker?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
clear
that
it
should
be
construed
as
though
the
system
was
mandatory
before
the
decision
in
booker,
rather
than
construed
in
the
light
of
the
remedial
decision
in
booker?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
is
that
any
more
dramatic
change
then
was
made
in
the
booker
remedial
opinion
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
remedial
opinion
basically
rewrote
the
whole
statute
on
--
except
that
it
didn't
have
to
reach
3582(c)(2),
but
it
certainly
changed
the
--
the
nature
of
the
mandatory
provisions
that
were
previously
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
accepting
the
point
that
there
is
no
constitutional
compulsion
that
they
had
to
open
up
for
a
full
new
sentencing,
and
i
understand
one
reason
for
not
doing
it
is
that
you
don't
impose
too
much
work
on
the
district
courts
for
doing
it,
but
could
you
explain
to
me:
why
is
it,
just
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
good
judgment,
the
commission
could
say,
well,
you
can
take
a
look
at
all
the
negative
factors
that
argue
against
reduction,
but
you
cannot
look
at
any
of
the
factors
that
would
show
why
you
should
have
had
the
same
sentence
that
if
--
why
you
should
get
the
kind
of
sentence
you
would
have
gotten
if
you
had
been
sentenced
in
the
first
place
today?
because
i
guess
this
particular
math
is
going
to
mean
spend
22
more
years
in
jail
than
if
you
had
been
sentenced
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that
the
statute
would
have
prohibited
a
more
generous
policy
statement,
then?
