justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understand
them
to
be
saying
nondisclosure
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
so
they
are
a
little
bit
more--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
why
don't
you
take
them
at
their
face,
which
is,
they
are
saying
it
has
to
be
a
nondisclosure
of
a
conflict
of
interest
that's
material?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
that's
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
let's
take
it
from
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
is
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--not
a
limiting
principle?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
--
it's
much
easier
in
the
public
sector,
i
agree
with
you,
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
talk
about
it
in
the
--
i'm
sorry.
in
the
private
sector,
it's
easier
to
talk
about.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
that
--
that
whether
he
did
it
with
disclosure
or
nondisclosure,
what
would
make
the
nondisclosure
more
meaningful?
meaning,
it's
taking
the
bribe,
whether
he
discloses
it
or
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
if
he
gets
up
on
the
floor
of
--
of
the
legislature
and
says:
you
know,
i
am
going
to
vote
for
this
bill
because
somebody
paid
me
money,
he
disclosed
it.
it
doesn't
make
it
any
better.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
if
he
had
voted
against
the
legislation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
not
merely
the
taking
official
action;
it's
taking
official
action
that
benefits
him?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
please
articulate
it
again
for
me.
i
--
i
am
--
i
don't
think
i'm
being
thick.
i'm
trying
to
understand
exactly
what
that
duty
is,
because
i
think
i
just
heard
something
that
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
you
are
saying
if
there's
a
state
duty
to
disclose,
a
federal
duty
to
disclose,
if
they
are
legal
duties,
that
would
violate
it,
and
now
something
else?
