justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean,
the
mail
fraud
statute
carries
a
very
heavy
penalty,
and
are
you
--
you
are
arguing
that
congress
intended
to
impose
this
penalty
on
individuals
who
breach
some
federal
or
state
disclosure
requirement,
even
if
that
is
viewed
by
the
body
that
is
responsible
for
the
disclosure
requirement
as
a
very
minor
thing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
do.
i
understand
you
are
saying
that
--
that
there
cannot
be
a
conviction
without
the
violation
of
some
duty.
but
if
we
agree
with
that,
then
we
are
going
down
the
road
of
deciding
what
sort
of
duty
suffices,
and
does
it
have
to
be
a
duty
that
is
backed
up
by
a
state
criminal
sanction?
what
if
--
what
if
it's
a
1-year
felony?
what
if
it's
a
misdemeanor?
what
if
it's
a
--
simply
a
civil
penalty?
what
if
it's
simply
some
sort
of
precatory
code
of
ethics--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--for
legislators?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
there's
a
statute
that
prohibits
a
legislator
from
engaging
in
certain
conduct
and
attaches
a
significant
penalty
to
it,
but
there
is
no
statute
that
requires
the
disclosure
of
the
conduct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
imagine
--
i'm
sorry.
i
imagine
legislators
must
vote
on
all
sorts
of
things
that
have
a
--
an
impact
on
their
own
financial
interests
or
the
financial
interests
of
their
family
or
associates.
for
example,
suppose
this
--
the
petitioner
was
a
practicing
attorney.
suppose
he's
voting
on
an
overhaul
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
some
of
them
may
benefit
him
and
his
practice.
or
suppose
he's
voting
on
a
new
tax
code,
and
the
provisions
may
benefit
him
or
his
family
or
his
associates
in
a
--
in
a
variety
of
ways.
don't
you
need
some
kind
of
a
disclosure
code
to
separate
the
things
that
have
to
be
disclosed
from
the
things
that
don't
have
to
be
disclosed,
because
they
are
just
too
common?
