chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-1196,
weyhrauch
v.
united
states.
mr.
ayer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
--
there
were
a
state
law
that
said
you
must
disclose
anything
that
could
reasonably
be
viewed
as
a
conflict
of
interest,
then
--
then
you
would
lose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben,
welcome
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
if
--
what
if
that
external
standard
imposed
penalties
vastly
different
from
the
mail
fraud
statute?
for
example,
what
if
alaska
had
a
law
here
that
said
you
must
disclose
this,
and
if
you
fail
to
disclose
it,
you
are
subject
to
6
months
in
jail
or
a
$500
fine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
light
sentence
because
the
disclosure
obligations
are
confusing,
but
--
and
then
the
federal
prosecutor
comes
along
and
says,
well,
you
--
you
are
going
away
for
20
years
because
this
violates
1346.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
he
knows
that
he
should
disclose
this,
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
you
have
no
problem
with
the
idea
that
the
state
law,
the
source
of
the
duty
to
disclose,
imposes
a
penalty
of
6
months,
and
the
federal
law
you
say
you
can
still
go
after
him
not
only
20
years
but
an
additional
20
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
principle
was
that
a
citizen
has
to
be
able
to
understand
the
law,
and
if
he
can't,
then
the
law
is
invalid.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
a
familiar
common
law
term.
"honest
services"
is
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
remembering.
was
the
phrase
"honest
services"
used
in
lemire?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
a
public
official
--
you
said
in
response
to
justice
stevens
that
this
actionable
conduct
has
to
benefit
the
defendant's
interest.
what
if
his
interest
is
a
particular
policy
contrary
to
that
of
his
employer?
in
other
words,
he
is
a
subordinate
official.
his
employer
says,
i
want
you
to
do
this
and
this
to
advance
our
policy.
he
doesn't
like
the
policy,
so
he
does
something
you
can
characterize
as
dishonest
that
undermines
the
policy
or
advanced
a
different
policy
that
he
agrees
with.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why?
because
it
doesn't
involve
tangible--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--financial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
has
to
involve
financial--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
where
does
the
right
to
honest
services
say
"financial"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
now,
mr.
ayer,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
