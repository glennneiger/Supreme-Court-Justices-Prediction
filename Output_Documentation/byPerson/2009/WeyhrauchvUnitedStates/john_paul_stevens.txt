justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
learning
something
about
the
case
that
i
didn't
understand
before.
are
you
agreeing
that
if
there
were
a
duty
to
disclose
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
that
then
the
statute
would
have
been
violated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
a
duty
to
disclose
could
never
qualify.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
your
position
is,
not
what
you
could
argue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
then
--
but
if
you
do
have
some
duty,
would
the
statute
have
been
violated
on
these
--
on
these
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
were
a
duty
to
disclose
the
negotiations
of
this
prospective
employer
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
it's
a
duty
to
disclose
those
facts
to
the
legislature.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
your
position
is
not
that
there's
no
duty;
it's
that
there
is
not
a
duty
with
sufficiently
severe
penalties?
is
that
what
your
position
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
not
a
--
your
position
is
not
that
there
be
no
duty
to
disclose;
you
are
saying
there
is
not
a
duty
to
disclose
of
sufficient
moment
to
justify
criminal
penalties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
give
you
this
example:
take
the
judge
holzer
case
we
all
know
about.
suppose,
in
49
states,
it
always
violates
state
law,
but
there's
some
state
that
has
a
special
rule
that,
unless
the
bribery
exceeds
$1,000,
there's
no
violation.
would
--
could
he
be
prosecuted
in
the
49th
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it's
not
illegal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
state
i'm
asking
you
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
have
to
be
alaska
law,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
it
does
not
have
to
be
alaska
law,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
just
trying
--
if
it's
--
it's
illegal
in
47
states,
but
not
in
the
state
in
which
the
prosecution
is
brought,
you
say
the
federal
rule
could
not
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
right
at
that
point:
does
the
prohibited
action,
namely,
voting
--
does
that
vote
have
to
be
contrary
to
--
serve
the
interest
of
the
other
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
you
--
you
have
described
the
issue
in
this
case
as
not
merely
a
nondisclosure,
but
as
you
spell
it
out,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
actually
a
quid
pro
quo
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
say
that
in
order
for
the
violation
to
be
complete,
he
must
follow
up
by
voting
in
the
interest
of
the
company
rather
than
the
polls?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
has
to
be
a
specific
kind
of
official
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
that
you'll
win
on
the
facts,
not
the
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
what
we
have
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
we
might
then
say
the
theory
that
they
described
there
is
inadequate.
but
would
we
then
send
the
case
back
and
say
decide
it
on
the
theory
that
mr.
dreeben
has
explained
today?
