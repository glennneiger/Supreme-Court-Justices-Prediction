justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
"honest
services".
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
have
been
trying
to
find
out
what
you
were
referring
to
on
pages
68
to
69.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
congress
say
that
instead
of
--
instead
of
--
of
setting
up
this
mush
of
language
that
doesn't
even
mention
mcnally,
does
not
use
a
phrase
that
any
opinion
pre-mcnally
used?
that
--
that
phrase
does
not
appear,
as
i
understand,
it
in
any
of
the
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
a
citizen
supposed
to
do?
he's
supposed
to
go
back
and
read
all
those
pre-mcnally
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
it
have
been
so
difficult
for
congress
to
say
no
bribes,
no
kickbacks,
and
--
and
--
and
the
third
thing,
however
you
want
to
describe
it?
[laughter]
i
mean,
i
think
it's
--
if
--
if
--
if
you
have
a
--
a
principle
that
the
citizen
is
supposed
to
know
when
he's
violating
a
criminal
statute,
this
is
--
i
mean,
it
is
just
too
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
number
one,
i
am
--
i
am
not
going
to
draw
any
generalities
from
the
civil
rights
statutes.
i
mean,
this
is
an
area
unto
itself,
and,
number
two,
the
sherman
act
explicitly
--
"explicitly"
--
clearly
confers
upon
courts
a
common
law,
a
common
law
ability
to
define
the
crime.
and
that
doesn't
appear
from
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
vague
law,
so
long
as
this
court
says,
oh,
what
the
law
--
the
law
--
it's
absolutely
unclear
what
the
law
means,
so
long
as
this
court
says,
oh,
we
think
the
law
means
--
what
do
you
want
to
pick
--
bribery,
then
--
then
it's
okay.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
system
we
have,
that
congress
can
say,
nobody
shall
do
any
bad
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
comes
to
this
court,
and
this
court
says,
bad
things
means
bribery.
and
that
law
is
a
valid
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
principle
that
you're
arguing
for,
that
--
that
a
law
that
is,
on
its
face,
inherently
vague
can
somehow
be
rendered
valid
to
the
citizens
by
a
decision
of
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
it
was
a
body
of
law.
it
wasn't
about
a
body
of
law.
we
said
it
was
wrong.
so
congress
is
not
here
referring
to
some
established
common
law
crimes
at
all.
it's
referring
to
a
mistaken
series
of
decisions
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
quite
different
from
--
from
harking
back
to
a
common
law
term,
such
as
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
--
it's
not
--
it's
not
just
one.
one
of
the
briefs
in
one
or
the
other
of
these
cases
describes
the
great
variety
of
"pushing
the
envelope"
prosecutions
that
the
justice
department
has,
indeed,
pursued,
and
they
are
all
over
the
place.
and
if
the
justice
department
can't
figure
out
what
--
what
is
embraced
by
this
statute,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
expect
the
average
citizen
to
figure
it
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
--
you
say
he
violated
state
law?
i
--
i
thought
that
the
--
that
the
court
found
that
he
didn't.
you
say
he
violated
state
law
when
he
voted.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
they
--
i
thought
it
was
accepted
in
this
case
that
--
that
there
was
no
violation
of
alaska
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
even--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
after
he
discloses
he
still
couldn't
vote
that
way,
so
he's
supposed
to
vote
against
it
even
though
he
thinks
it's
a
good
thing
for
the
state
to
do?
