justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
your
arguments
--
an
important
argument
in
your
brief
is
the
--
the
federal
balance,
apart
from
vagueness
for
a
moment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
was
the
lurking
problem
here.
you
say
it
should
be
state
law,
because
then
the
federal
courts
would
at
least
tell
states
that
they
can't
enforce
their
own
law
strictly
enough.
but
if
it's
federal
law,
then
the
federal
government
tells
the
states:
well,
regardless
of
your
standards,
we
have
our
standards.
i
don't
see
much
to
choose
from
in
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
those
--
those
two
alternatives.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
if
there's
a
state
law
prohibition--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
this
statute
applies.
but
then
--
then
the
federal
government
is
telling
the
states:
well,
we
don't
like
the
way
you
enforce
your
laws;
we're
going
to
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
there's
not
much
to
choose
between
--
between
the
two
arguments.
