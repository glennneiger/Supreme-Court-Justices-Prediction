justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
think
they're
saying
--
which
i
am
getting
gradually--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
think
what
he's
saying
is:
first,
we
know
what
bribery
is;
we
can
deal
with
that
one.
second,
we
know
what
kickbacks
are;
we
can
deal
with
that
one.
and
what
he
means
by
the
honest
services
other
than
that
is,
imagine
a
list
of
5
million
bits
of
honest
service
that
a
workman
has
to
perform
for
his
employer.
now,
on
that
list,
there
might
be
35
requirements
to
disclose
something
where
the
interest
of
the
employer
goes
--
employee
goes
the
other
way.
and
he's
saying
it
violates
the
statute
not
to
do
that
in
circumstances
where
the
employee
knows
that
the
failure
to
disclose
will,
in
fact,
lead
the
employer,
to
whom
he
should
have
disclosed
it,
to
make
a
significant
decision;
namely,
that
decision
to
avoid
which
was
the
reason
he
didn't
disclose
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
think
what
he
is
saying
is
that's
rather
precise.
that
fits
with
what
was
there
before,
and
therefore,
all
the
government
is
saying
is:
now
we
have
those
three
things.
if
you
didn't
quite
--
i
didn't
quite
get
that
out
of
the
brief,
but
that
may
be
my
fault.
all
right?
so
anyway,
it
was
probably
there;
when
i
go
back,
i'll
see
it.
and
those
are
the
three
things.
so
he's
saying:
you
see?
it
doesn't
matter
the
source
as
long
as
there
is
a
clear
legal
obligation,
which
could
come
from
corporation
law,
for
the
employee
to
disclose
the
conflict
in
this
situation.
i
think
that's
what
it
is.
well,
and
so
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
saying,
i
take
it,
that
there
was
no
duty
in
alaska
criminal
law,
disclosure
law,
to
disclose.
i
think
you
might
find
in
a
treatise
on
agency
that
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
even
in
the
uniform
commercial
code
or
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
something
that
the
average
citizen
who
works
there
just
knows
all
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
intended
not
to
disclose
something,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
okay.
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
now
--
now
think
of
that
answer
--
complete
that
answer,
if
you
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
go
back
to
--
i'm
trying
to
get
you
back
to
your
general
answer
that
you
wanted
to
give.
and
i
--
i
--
remember
my
list
of
6,000
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
i
made
up,
and
these
are
all
the
things
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--an
employee
owes
an
employer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
some
of
them
--
you
have
taken
out
three
--
no
bribes,
no
kickbacks
and
no
conflicts
of
interest
where
that's
defined
in
the
narrow
way
you've
defined
it.
you
have
to
know
you
are
not
disclosing,
you
know
you
have
the
obligation,
you
know
action
will
be
taken
on
it,
and
the
action
will
be
taken
to
help
somebody
else
or
to
the
detriment
of
the
employer
or
something
like
that.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
something
like
that.
okay.
[laughter]
so,
now,
i
think,
well,
i
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
language
of
that
statute.
and
i
say,
oh,
my
goodness,
why
did
you
pick
these
three?
i
mean,
i
can
easily
--
i
make
up
comical
examples
because
they
illustrate
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
mean
them
to
be
comical.
look,
think
of
a
person
who
is
really
angry
at
his
employer
and
he
changes
all
the
direction
signs
around
in
the
building
to
mislead
him
so
that
the
employer
will
miss
the
key
meeting
and
make
the
wrong
decision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
why
not
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
that's
not
my
point.
i
don't
believe
the
way
you've
interpreted
the
statute
that
you
could
or
would
--
could
prosecute
what
i
just
made
up
as
a
funny
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
can
make
up
thousands
of
examples
from
the
list,
and
i
think
justice
scalia's
original
point
was
something
like,
well,
you've
taken
some
words,
28
words
that
cover
6,000
things,
and
out
of
those
6,000
things,
you
have
picked,
perhaps
randomly,
3
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
say
it
covers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
you
picked
them
--
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
there
was
a
principle
that
a
citizen
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
understand
the
criminal
law
that
was
around
even
before
justice
scalia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
sherman
act
criminalizes
price
fixing.
you
see,
i
can
say
that
in
two
words,
intentional
price
fixing.
do
you
think
what
we
have
been
talking
about
this
morning
can
be
reduced
to
anything
like
those
two
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
let
me
ask
a
quick
question
here.
i
notice,
in
the
skilling
case,
the
first
question
is
whether
the
statute
requires
the
government
to
prove
the
defendant's
conduct
was
intended
to
achieve
private
gain,
et
cetera,
and
if
not,
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
now,
does
that
first
question
give
the
government
an
opportunity
sufficient
to
say
whatever
it
wants
in
its
brief
about
the
constitutional
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
we
could
assume
that,
if
you
need
time,
at
that
time,
you
could
ask
for
whatever
you
wanted
to
ask
for?
