mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
good
to
be
back.
[laughter]
the
one
thing
that
i
think
the
parties,
the
cases,
and
this
court,
in
its
description
of
section
1346
in
cleveland,
agree
on
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
restore
at
least
some
part
of
the
pre-mcnally
doctrine
of
intangible
rights.
it,
therefore,
makes
sense
to
take
a
look
at
the
theory
of
intangible
rights
violation
that
mr.
ayer
very
ably
argued
for
the
government
when
he
argued
the
mcnally
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
that
case
--
that
theory--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
what
the
document
that
you
are
reading
from
said,
justice
ginsburg.
one
week
later,
the
government
filed
a
clarification
of
its
--
of
its
position
in
response
to
petitioner's
briefing
of
the
issue,
and
this
appears
at
pages
68
and
69
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
in
that
filing,
the
government
made
clear
that
its
theory,
consistent
with
the
theory
that
i
am
arguing
here
today,
is
that
when
the
legislator
takes
official
action
having
an
undisclosed
conflict
of
interest,
that's
when
he
violates
the
honest
services
statute
under
the
nondisclosure
theory.
we
are
not
here
to
urge
that
there
is
a
general
duty
of
disclosure
that
is
separate
and
apart
from
any
official
act
that
the
official
takes.
we
are
not
here
to
argue
that
there's
a
free-standing
federal
duty
of
disclosure
that
applies
in
all
cases,
regardless
of
the
other
elements
of
the
mail
fraud
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
shorthand
summary
of
the
nondisclosure
theory.
the
more
accurate
summary
of
the
government's
theory
is
on
page
20a,
on
the
first
full
paragraph
that
begins
with
the
bracketed
9.
and
it
says,
"here,
weyhrauch
allegedly
voted
and
took
other
official
acts
on
legislation
at
the
direction
of
veco
while
engaged
in
undisclosed
negotiations
for
future
legal
work
from
veco.
"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"these
allegations
describe
an
undisclosed
conflict
of
interest
and
could
also
support
an
inference
of
a
quid
pro
quo.
"
furthermore,
petitioner--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--on
the
bottom
of
page
68,
justice
scalia,
there's
a
italicized
word,
"first".
and
it
describes--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
more
detailed
theory
that
the
government
is
elaborating,
and
then
on
page
69,
it
says,
quote,
"by
introducing
amendments
to
and
voting
on
legislation
that
each
defendant
knew
would
affect
company
a,
an
entity
with
whom
each
defendant
either
had
or
was
negotiating
for
a
financial
relationship,
each
defendant
knowingly
breached
that
duty
of
disclosure.
"
so
i
think
the
government
tied
up
the
nondisclosure
to
the
official
act
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
not
under
an
incorrect
impression
about
that.
and
more
fundamentally,
petitioner
says
--
i
believe
it's
in
footnote
6
of
his
opening
brief
--
that
that's
not
the
issue
before
the
court,
how
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
duty
of
disclosure.
that's
an
issue
that
will
arise,
and
i
think
petitioner's
counsel
said
this
to
the
district
court
--
it's
in
a
page
of
the
joint
appendix
that
i
don't
have
at
my
fingertips
--
that's
a
matter
for
jury
instructions.
and
we
agree.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
it's
not
enough,
justice
ginsburg,
not
standing
alone.
it's
when
the
official
takes
action
that
furthers
his
undisclosed
interest
without
telling
the
decision-making
body
to
which
he
belongs
that
he
becomes
a
fraud.
it's
just
like
o'hagan,
justice
ginsburg.
when
o'hagan,
the
lawyer,
took
the
information
from
his
firm,
posed
as
a
loyal
employee,
the
partner
who
comes
to
work
every
day
just
doing
his
job,
it
became
a
fraud
when
he
took
that
information
and
used
it
in
his
own
securities
trading.
here,
too,
this
is
not
a
pure
nondisclosure
theory.
this
is
another
form
of
corruption.
it's
the
kind
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
he
did
not
further
his
undisclosed
interests,
then
he
does
not
breach
the
duty
that
the
government
alleges--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
--
you
could
do
it
that
way,
justice
alito,
but
the
way
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
does
it
is
it
looks
for
the
kind
of
personal
conflicting
financial
interest
that,
in
the
universal
view
of
the
common
law,
raised
a
problem.
those
are
interests
that
are
different
from
the
public
at
large
and
that
are
not
widely
held
by
a
large
segment
of
the
community.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
when
we
are
talking
about
state
legislative
officers,
when
we
are
talking
about
public
officials,
they
know
that
they
are
fiduciaries.
they
have
a
set
of
fiduciary
obligations.
but
to
answer
most
directly,
justice
breyer,
your
concern,
which
i
believe
goes
to
notice,
and
whether
a
state
legislator
can
be
held
criminally
liable
for
violating
a
standard
stated
as
i
have
just
stated
it,
the
government
must
prove
in
a
criminal
case
an
intent
to
defraud.
that
means
that
the
government
must
show
that
the
defendant
sought
to
deceive
the
body
to
which
he
belongs--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
that
he
knew
he
was
breaching
a
duty.
he
does
not
need
to
know
the
legal
source
of
the
duty.
that's
conventional
law
as
in
bryan
v.
united
states.
you
can
know
that
you
are
acting
illegally
without
knowing
that
it's
federal
law,
state
law,
or
local
law--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
the
government
needs
to
show
that.
and
that
means
that
in
the
typical
case,
the
government
will
point
to
some
external
standard,
be
it
a
state
criminal
law,
a
state
civil
law,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
we
would
have
to
show,
first
of
all,
that
he
knew
that
he
was
breaching
a
legal
duty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
okay.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
then
my
answer
is
we
live
in
a
dual
system
in
which
citizens
are
governed
by
and
accountable
both
by
their
states
and
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
this
is
fundamental
to
the
government's
position
here,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
not
imposing
a
criminal
penalty
for
violation
of
the
state
law
duty.
there
is
an
independent
federal
duty.
congress
was
well
aware
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
to
this
court
this
morning
is
that
what
1346
reinstated
was
the
notion
that
if
fiduciaries
have
a
duty
not
to
further
their
own
personal
conflicting
financial
interests
by
taking
official
action,
it
becomes
a
federal
crime
only
when
there
is
both
materiality
and
intent
to
defraud.
and
to
prove
the
intent
to
defraud
element
that
the
individual
intended
to
deprive
the
citizens
of
their
right
of
honest
services,
the
government
has
to
know
--
show
that
he
knew
he
was
breaching
a
fiduciary
duty.
and
the
government
can
do
that
by
offering
evidence,
for
example,
that
state
law
precluded
the
action
that
he
took
--
the
underlying
action
in
this
case
by
mr.
weyhrauch
was
prohibited
by
state
law.
you
are
not
permitted
to
vote
on
legislation
when
you
were
negotiating
for
employment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
it
does,
justice
stevens.
he
has
to
be
furthering
his
undisclosed
interest.
and
in
this
case
he
did
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he
did
it
in
violation
of
a
state
substantive
duty,
and
the
government's
burden
will
be
to
show
he
knew
he
was
acting
wrongfully.
and
often
we
will
do
that
by
pointing
to
state
law
and
saying
he
violated
state
law
or
he
violated
an
ethics
code
that
attached
to
him
as
a
fiduciary.
if
not,
we
are
going
to
have
to
find
some
evidence
of
circumvention,
structuring
transactions,
nominee
accounts,
surreptitious
meetings,
things
that
indicate
that
an
individual
knows
that
he
is
acting
fraudulently.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
something
like
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
breyer,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
really
don't
think
that
this
court
needs
to
worry
about
that
as
a
type
of
honest
services
prosecution,
because
this
was
a
defined
universe
of
cases--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
--
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
say
that
we
picked
them
randomly--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--ignores
the
story
of
mcnally.
and
i
think
that
if
i
could
take
a
minute
to
walk
the
court
through
the
legal
history
that
brought
us
to
this,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful.
before
mcnally,
there
was
a
body
of
case
law
that
made
very
clear
that
there
was
a
substratum
fiduciary
duty
--
and
i'll
limit
this
to
the
public
official
context
for
now,
because
that's
the
most
critical
and
important
context.
if
you
look
at
the
common
law
in
every
state,
public
officials
are
fiduciaries.
the
core
obligation
of
a
fiduciary
is
the
duty
of
loyalty,
the
duty
not
to
advance
your
personal
interests
at
the
expense
of
the
government
who
you
serve.
that
core
understanding
of
the
duty
of
loyalty
informed
the
honest
services
cases
that
arose
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
for
the
most
part,
they
involved,
as
their
core
set
of
violations,
bribes,
in
which
somebody
is
selling
his
office,
so
he's
clearly
not
serving
the
public;
kickbacks,
where
the
individual
is
profiting
at
the
expense
of
the
government,
oftentimes
in
his
official
capacity,
and
sometimes
not
profiting
at
the
expense
of
the
government,
because
the
government
couldn't
be
harmed
in
a
pecuniary
way
by
the
kickback;
and
undisclosed
conflicts
of
interest
when
the
official
takes
action
to
further
that
interest.
and
that's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
--
justice
scalia,
the
phrase
"intangible
rights"
is
at
the
center
of
the
mcnally
majority
opinion.
the
language
"honest
services"
is
in
the
mcnally
dissent
and
in
many
of
the
pre-mcnally
opinions.
for
those--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
we
would
all
agree,
justice
scalia,
that
had
congress
taken
your
counsel,
i
would
not
be
here
today--
[laughter]
--defending
what
the
congress
attempted
to
do.
but
i
think
that
congress
viewed
it
as
a
permissible
and
in
some
ways
clearer
way
of
getting
to
the
result
it
wanted,
to
point
to
the
body
of
case
law
with
the
recognition
that
it
was
understood
in
its
core
aspects
to
cover
what
i
have
just
described.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
understand
that,
justice
breyer--
[laughter]
--but
this
would
not
--
this
is
not
an
isolated
area
where
the
court
has
recognized
that
criminal
sanctions
need
to
take
into
account
decisional
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
principle
is
that
the
court
has
recognized
--
and
it
has
done
so
most
prominently
in
the
sherman
act
and
in
the
civil
rights
statutes,
18
u.s.c.,
section
241
and
242,
that
these
are
broad
statutes
with
general
language,
and
in
order
to
be
made
susceptible
of
criminal
punishment,
you
need
two
things.
you
need
clarifying
judicial
decisions
that
articulate
the
rights,
and
you
need
a
standard
of
scienter
that
will
allow
the
government
to
convict
only
those
people
who
are
on
fair
notice
and
act
with
a
--
the
bad
purpose--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
wasn't
citing
the
sherman
act
as
an
example
of
formulating
a
common
law
of
crimes,
but
there
is
only
one
due
process
clause,
justice
scalia,
so
if
it
is
constitutional
to
prosecute
under
the
civil
rights
statutes
and
under
the
sherman
act,
then
it
is
constitutional
for
this
court
to
divine
from
the
pre-mcnally
case
law
principles
and
to
articulate
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
i've
got
it
down
to
around
eight.
[laughter]
let
me
--
let
me
just
mention,
in
the
civil
rights
area,
it
may
not
answer
your
concerns,
justice
scalia,
but
i
think
the
court
should
know
that,
in
the
united
states
v.
kozminski,
the
court
recognized
--
and
i
am
going
to
quote
here
--
that,
"congress
intended
the
statute
to
incorporate,
by
reference,
a
large
body
of
potentially
evolving
federal
law.
"
and
the
court
recognized
that
that
was
a
dilemma
because
you
cannot
have
citizens
criminally
prosecuted
for
evolving
law
of
which
the
citizens
have
no
notice.
and
the
court's
response
was
to
say
that,
when
the
right
has
been
made
specific
by
a
decision
of
this
court
and
there's
the
requisite
level
of
scienter,
there
is
no
due
process
problem
in
prosecuting--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
not
what
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
not
what
this
law
says,
and
that's
not
what
this
court
has
done
in
response
to
other
criminal
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
that's
common.
this
court
takes
common
law
terms
of
art,
such
as
fraud,
and
it
reads
into
them
elements
that
are
not
on
their
face
on
the
basis
of
the
common
law.
take,
for
example,
18
u.s.c.
1111,
which
is
the
federal
murder
statute.
it
uses
the
phrase
"malice
aforethought".
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
it
is
a
term
of
art
that
had
reference
to
a
specific
body
of
case
law
that
could
not
have
been
given
a
higher
degree
of
prominence
than
it
was
by
this
court's
decision
in
mcnally,
which
acknowledged
that
body
of
law,
rejected
it
because
it
said
the
mail
fraud
statute
did
not
protect
intangible
rights.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
recall,
either,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--whether
the
phrase--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
can't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
mcnally,
this
court
said
that
body
of
law
was
not
a
valid
implementation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute,
and
it
invited
congress
to
come
back
and
legislate
if
it
wanted
to
protect
intangible
rights,
and
congress
did
that
in
a
way
that
doesn't
have
the
commendable
clarity
of
the
statute
that
you
just
drafted
for
us,
justice
scalia,
but
it
does
refer
--
and
i
think,
for
those
members
of
the
court
who
read
legislative
history,
legislative
history
was
replete
with
references
to
the
key
cases
on
which
we
rely
here,
such
as
united
states
v.
mandel
and
united
states
v.
margiotta.
and
it
said
this
is
a
term
of
art.
we
know
that
this
is
a
term
of
art.
it's
been
shaped
by
the
judiciary,
but
it
doesn't
just
sit
there
as
a
pre-standing
duty
that
had
no
antecedents
in
the
law
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
decide
whether
congress
validly
accepted
this
court's
invitation
to
reinstate
an
important
public
corruption
principle
by
looking
to
what
one
united
states
attorney,
one
set
of
federal
prosecutors
said
in
a
pleading
that
was
filed
on
very
short
notice
and
that
was--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
this
body
of
law
evolved
post-mcnally,
without
this
court's
intervention
and
guidance
to
provide
clarification.
i
think
that
the
core
understanding
of
what
honest
services
is
may
have
been
strayed
from
in
some
of
those
cases,
and
some
courts
of
appeals
affirmed
it.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
statute
is
vague.
this
court
accepted
review
in
cleveland
v.
united
states
because
the
courts
of
appeals
were
divided
on
whether
defrauding
a
government
agency
of
a
license
constituted
a
deprivation
of
money
or
property.
the
u.s.
attorneys
on
one
side
of
the
split
were
very
aggressively
pushing
that
theory.
this
court
held
that
it
wasn't
a
valid
interpretation.
i
think
that
it's
the
role
of
this
court
and
the
--
within
the
proper
disposition
of
this
court's
authority
to
attempt
to
figure
out
what
congress
did,
and
then
to
implement
it
in
accordance
with
doctrines
that
are
standard
tools
of
the
trade
here
--
rule
of
lenity,
concerns
about
federalism
--
and
recognize
that
there
is
a
core
that
congress
was
looking
at
in
the
pre
--
mcnally
cases,
and
that
that
core
can
be
implemented
consistent
with
concerns
about
notice
and
clarity
of
definition,
without
either
creating
a
statute
that
is
totally
freeform
or
without
invalidating
congress's
effort
to
respond
to
the
court's
invitation
in
mcnally.
and,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
state
law
duties
need
to
be
violated,
state
law
disclosure
obligations
need
to
be
violated
in
order
to
sustain
a
valid
mail
fraud
prosecution.
the
pre-mcnally
cases
and
mcnally
itself
answers
that
because,
in
the
mcnally
decision,
this
court
acknowledged
that
the
government's
theory
of
prosecution
was
that
mcnally
and
his
cohorts
were
accepting
kickbacks
in
the
form
of
commissions
on
insurance
contracts.
and
the
courts
recognized
that
the
government's
theory
was
they
failed
to
disclose
their
interest
to
persons
in
state
government
who
were
in
a
position
to
take
action
with
respect
to
that
information.
and
the
court
specifically
said:
we
should
assume
that
there
was
no
violation
of
any
state
law
obligations
in
holding
those
interests
or
no
violation
of
any
state
law
duty
to
disclose.
that
was
the
theory
of
prosecution
that
the
court
recognized
the
government
was
pursuing,
and
it
was
entirely
consistent
with
the
pre-mcnally
cases,
mandel
and
margiotta,
which
were
repeatedly
cited
in
the
legislative
history.
and
i
won't
take
the
court's
time
to
read
language
--
we've
cited
it
in
our
brief
--
where
those
cases
clearly
said
no
state
law
duty
was
required
to
be
breached
in
order
to
state
a
prosecution.
there
is
still
protection
in
this
statute
against
prosecutions
of
citizens
without
notice
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
government
has
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
duty
to
disclose
by
the
officials
taking
action
to
further
his
undisclosed
personal
interest,
and
the
citizen
cannot
be
prosecuted
and
convicted
without
the
government
being
able
to
show
that
he
knew
that
he
was
violating
a
duty
to
disclose.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
until
mr.
skilling
files
his
brief
and
explains
the
kind
of
argument
that
he
wants
to
make,
i
can't
answer
you
that
question.
all
i
know
is
that
in
one
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--certainly.
and
i
don't
--
the
government
is
not
shying
away
from
the
question
of
vagueness.
the
question
of
vagueness
has
been
raised
by
members
of
this
court
as
a
legitimate
concern.
i
think
it's
a
legitimate
concern.
that
is
why
the
government
has
offered
to
this
court
a
theory
based
on
the
prototypical
and
paradigm
pre-mcnally
cases
that
explains
what
congress
said
when
it
effectively
pointed
at
that
body
of
law
and
said
those
are
the
intangible
rights
that
we
want
to
protect.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
doesn't
have
to
be
quid
pro
quo,
justice
stevens,
because
even
if
mr.
weyhrauch
had
not
made
an
agreement
with
veco
that
he
was
going
to
vote
the
way
that
veco
wanted
him
to,
and
the
government
does
allege
that,
but
even
if
he
didn't
do
that,
he
knew
that
he
had
a
personal
financial
interest
in
securing
employment
with
veco--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he
has
to
take
official
action.
that's
where
the
breach
of
his
duty
and
loyalty--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--official
action
that
furthers
his
undisclosed
interest.
and
to
criminally
prosecute
him,
he
has
to
know
that's
what
he
is
doing,
and
just
to
top
it
off,
there
are
materiality
ingredients
both
in
the
conflict
of
interest
and
in
the
implied
misrepresentation
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--substantive
state
law
prohibited
him
from
taking
official
action
with
respect
to
a
company
whose
interests
would
be
benefited
when
he
was
negotiating
employment--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
accepted
justice
scalia
that
there's
no
duty
to
disclose
under
state
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
solely
what
petitioner
argues
as
being
the
deficiency
in
the
government's
case;
there's
no
state
law
duty
to
disclose.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
my
response
is
naturally
there's
no
duty
under
state
law
to
disclose
as
a
matter
of
express
state
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
state
laws
prohibit--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he's
supposed
to
abstain.
when
he
has
a
conflict
of
interest,
he
is
supposed
to
note
that
conflict
and
he's
supposed
to
abstain.
and
we
argued--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
not
the
sort
of
theory
of
honest
services
that
we're
arguing
for,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
a
personal,
conflicting
financial
interest.
it
may
involve--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
these
--
the
core
of
public
corruption
is
about
adverse
pecuniary
interests
or
benefits
that
an
official
is
taking
at
the
expense
of
the
citizenry
by
virtue
of
his
position.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it
says
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
by
looking
at
the
body
of
case
law
that
involved
violations
of
the
right
of
honest
services
and
seeing
that
that's
what
the
government
was
after,
personal
conflicting
financial
interests.
and
this
is
not
a
subtle
or
obscure
principle
of
fiduciary
law
--
if
i
might
finish
my
last
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
is
a
bedrock
principle
of
the
common
law
that
exists
in
all
50
states,
and
the
mistake
that
the
lower
courts
made
in
the
pre-mcnally
era
was
in
thinking
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
protected
it,
but
there
was
no
obscurity
whatsoever
that
the
fiduciaries
owe
an
obligation
of
undivided
loyalty
to
their
principal.
that's
what
this
statute
is
about.
