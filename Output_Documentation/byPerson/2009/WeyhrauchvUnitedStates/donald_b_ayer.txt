mr.
donald
b.
ayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
counsel
for
the
united
states
defended
the
mcnally
prosecution
before
this
court
in
1987,
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
acknowledge
that
many
of
the
existing
intangible
rights
cases
contained
what
he
called
"extravagant"
language
that,
on
its
face,
extended
the
doctrine
far
beyond
the
principle
that
one
can
be
guilty
of
fraudulently
denying
others
the
performance
of
a
clear
legal
duty
that
he
owes.
i
know
that
because
the
government
lawyer
was
me--
[laughter]
and
that
was
the
only
thing
i
said
that
day
that
the
7-2
majority
agreed
with.
but
22
years
later,
and
one
28-word
statute
later,
the
united
states
is
now
pressing
to
take
that
extravagant
language
of
the
pre-mcnally
cases
to
the
bank.
it
does
that
by
contending
that
a
public
official
commits
honest
services
fraud
simply
by
failing
to
disclose
an
arguable
conflict
of
interest,
even
though
he
has
no
legal
duty
to
disclose
apart
from
the
words
of
1346.
and
it
--
and
it
is
possible
to
do
that
under
the
extravagant
words
of
the
earlier
cases
by
relying
on
a
supposed
federal
common
law
fiduciary
duty
of
loyalty
that
is
owed
by
all
public
officials,
including
state
officials,
to
their
constituents.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
your
honor,
you
are
now
asking
me
the
question
about
the
outer
perimeter
of
the
statute.
my
argument
is
that
a
duty
--
some
duty
clear
in
the
law
is
absolutely
necessary.
what
kind
of
a
duty
would
be
sufficient
is
a
much
more
difficult
question,
and
it's
a
difficult
question
for
--
for,
essentially,
two
reasons.
one
is,
the
duty
must
be
clear
and
not
vague.
that's
one
point.
the
more
complex
point
is
a
point
relating
to
this
court's
clear
statement
rule
and
related
concepts
concerning
particular
duties.
if
a
state
creates
a
system
of
contractual
duties,
those
duties
have
certain
consequences.
generally
speaking,
contractual
duties
have
a
consequence
of
paying
damages.
people
conduct
themselves
in
certain
ways
in
a
contractual
system.
they
don't
expect
to
go
to
jail,
usually,
for
breaching
a
contractual
duty.
similarly--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--oh,
i'm
--
i'm
--
your
honor,
if
i
left
that
impression,
let
me
completely
reject
it.
that
is
not
at
all
what
i'm
arguing.
to
the
contrary,
i
am
arguing
that
--
that
ultimately,
the
task
this
court
may
decide
it
must
pursue
--
which,
i
think,
frankly,
is
quite
separate
from
our
case,
because
our
case
is
a
case
where
there
is
no
duty,
period,
in
the
law,
which
i
want
to
explain
procedurally
why
that's
true
--
if
you
are
going
to
decide
that
some
duties
are
enough
and
other
duties
are
not,
it
is
a
very
challenging
thing
to
do,
and
a
very--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
your
honor,
i
--
let
me
--
i
want
to
repeat
again
that
--
that
in
--
in
my
view,
our
case
doesn't
turn
on
my
ability
to
satisfactorily
draw
this
line
which
no
court
has
driven
--
drawn
effectively
in
50
years.
but
i
would
--
i
would
say
this:
there
are
two
approaches
that
have
been
suggested
that
--
that
have
fewer
problems
than
others.
and
one
--
if
you
begin
with
the
question
of
duty
and
say,
what
duties
will
suffice
--
and
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
endorsing
this;
i'm
simply
saying
it
--
it
pares
the
covered
duties
back
significantly
to
a
point
where
this
court
might
find
it
preferable
to
some
other
approaches
--
would
be
the
one
your
honor
mentioned,
criminal
law
duties,
duties
as
to
which
the
conduct
breached
already
is
criminal.
there's
a
subsidiary
question,
i
think:
whether,
in
fact,
you
might
want
to
require
felony
duties,
because
there
are
different
penalties
with
regard
to
different
duties.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
agree,
your
honor.
that
is
--
that
is
a
problem
with
it.
and
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
here
to
endorse
that
as
a
satisfactory
alternative.
i'm
simply
saying
it's
preferable
to
some
of
the
others.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
i'm
asking
the
court
--
and
that's
a
confusion
in
the
question
presented.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
very
clearly,
and
the
trial
court
found,
made
no
attempt
to
produce
anything
other
than
1346
as
the
source
of
any
federal
disclosure
duty.
there
was
no
federal
disclosure
duty
that
they
could
point
to
specifically
dealing
with
disclosure.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
ended
up
focusing
--
in
fact,
i'd
like,
if
i
could,
to
take
a
couple
of
minutes
on
the
procedure
to
establish
sort
of
the
posture
of
this
case,
because
i
think
it
may
otherwise
be
confusing.
essentially,
what
we
had
here
was
an
indictment
that,
when
filed,
in
the
vaguest
of
terms,
it
alleged
as
the
purpose
--
and
this
is
at
joint
appendix
page
35
--
the
purpose
of
the
scheme
was
for
company
a
to
agree
to
provide
things
of
value
to
the
petitioner
to
cause
petitioner
to
misuse
his
official
authority
for
the
benefit
of
company
a.
a
traditional,
simple
allegation
of
--
of
bribery.
and
there
has
never
been
a
question
in
this
case
that
if
the
government
thinks
it
can
prove
that
case,
they
are
welcome
to
try.
and
--
and
they
can
do
that,
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that,
they
have
--
it's
certainly
open
to
them
to
show
that
the
defendant
didn't
specifically
stand
up
and
make
an
announcement
that
he
had
submitted
a
job
solicitation
to
company
a,
as
he
had
submitted
solicitations
to
a
half
a
dozen
other
employers,
as
is
perfectly
legal
under
alaska
law.
so
all
of
that
is
fair
game.
but
a
few
days
before
trial,
what
ended
up
happening
here
--
and
this
is
where
this
case
comes
from.
a
few
days
before
trial,
first
in
a
trial
brief
and
thereafter
in
a
motion
in
limine
dealing
with
submission
of
evidence,
the
government
announced
that
it
wanted
to
--
to
pursue
what
it
called
--
what
the
trial
court
called
its
alternative
theory;
frankly,
we
think,
because
they
couldn't
prove
their
bribery
case.
and
what
they
said
their
theory
was,
was
that
when
a
public
official
--
this
is
in
the
trial
brief.
there's
an
almost
exact
quote,
similar,
at
j.a.
42
in
the
joint
appendix.
"when
a
public
official
fails
to
disclose
the
existence
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
whether
required
by
law
to
do
so
or
whether
required
by
fiduciary
duty
to
do
so,
the
public
official
can
be
found
guilty
of
honest
services
fraud,
irrespective
of
whether
the
public
official
took
any
action
thereafter,
much
less
a
fraudulent
or
harmful
act.
"
in
other
words,
mr.
weyhrauch
--
mr.
weyhrauch
sent
a
solicitation
letter,
and
that's
about
the
size
of
it.
he
sent
a
solicitation
letter
to
a
number
of
people.
he
is
a
part-time
legislator
in
a
state
that
has
a
citizen
legislature
that
has
made
a
decision
specifically
not
to
have
its
--
its
disclosure
rules
be
unduly
burdensome.
that's
their
own
specific
language:
they
don't
want
them
to
be
unduly
burdensome.
they
have
required
certain
disclosures.
they
have
not
required
others.
the
trial
court
here
looked
at
the
government's
motion,
which
was
to
put
in
evidence
about
alaska
ethics
rules
in
support
of
this
alternative
theory.
and,
indeed,
the
court
said
--
and
the
court
of
appeals,
at
3a
of
the
--
of
the
pet.
app.
said
that
the
evidence
was
exclusively
to
pursue
this
alternative
theory
that
all
you
needed
to
do
was
fail
to
disclose
in
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty,
and,
bingo,
if
you
go
on
doing
your
job,
you
have
committed
honest
services
fraud.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
and,
in
fact,
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that,
all
you
need
to
do
is
read
at
page
36a
in
the
--
in
the
petition
appendix,
where
the
court
says
exactly
where
the
case
stands
after
his
ruling.
he
says
at
the
end
of
his
order,
"this
leaves
the
united
states
to
prove
the
honest
services
fraud
charges
in
this
case
based
on
violations
of
the
law
other
than
a
duty
to
disclose
defendant's
dealings
with
veco.
"
they
can
pursue
any
theory
they
want
that
--
that
is
a
legitimate
theory.
they
just
can't
come
in
and
say:
you
breached
a
duty
to
disclose.
alaska
law
doesn't
require
that
you
disclose.
there's
no
federal
statute
saying
you
have
to
disclose.
it's
just
implicit
in
the
concept
of
honest
services
that
you
needed
to
disclose
this.
now,
basically,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
what
happened
here
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
court
of
--
the
court
of
appeals
excluded
the
evidence,
which
was
offered
only
in
pursuit
of
that
theory.
why?
because
it
said:
i
don't
have
a
state
law
violation;
i
don't
have
a
clear
federal
law
violation;
the
only
way
i
can
do
this
is
by
invocation
of
federal
common
law.
and
then
he
said,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
citing
some
cases:
this
is
not
something
i'm
going
to
do;
i
think
it's
inappropriate.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
and
the
ninth
circuit
essentially
said
--
and
it's
very
much
like
what
i
heard
this
morning
from
government's
counsel
--
that
section
1346
reinstated
the
pre-mcnally
law,
including
all
of
its
wonderful
dicta
and
--
and
wild
phrases
about
duties
that
exist,
that
nondisclosure
--
and
i
think
this
is
even
highly
dubious;
in
fact,
i
think
it's
flatly
wrong
--
that
within
that
body
of
law,
nondisclosure
of
material
information
--
and
this
is
just
standing
alone.
it's
not
nondisclosure
in
the
context
of,
i'm
defrauding
you;
i'm
tricking
you
out
of
money,
or
i'm
tricking
you
out
of
some
duty
that
i
really
--
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
what
--
and
obviously
there
is
the
materiality
requirement,
as
the
government
has
said.
but
--
but
as--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
that's
right.
--they
said
earlier,
and
that's
what
i'm
understanding
them
to
say
now.
no,
i
think
you
are
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
the
--
the
problem
is
that
if
you
--
if
you
ask
the
question
in
the
context
of
this
pure
nondisclosure
theory,
the
materiality,
as
the
--
as
the
government
articulated
it
here
today
and
as
i
think
they
have
articulated
it
in
their
brief,
was
whether
it's
reasonably
likely
to
affect
the
decision
of
the
relevant
whoever,
the
relevant
person.
now,
as
--
as
justice
breyer,
i
think,
indicated,
it's
very
easy
to
talk
about
materiality
when
you
are
talking
about
deception
or
concealment
as
a
--
as
a
method
of
doing
someone
out
of
another
thing--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--but
i'm
--
but--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--but
i'm
talking
--
i
mean,
i
--
i
can
--
i
can
well
understand
the
concept
of
bribery,
say,
where
a
public
official
has
a
duty
to
award
contracts
to
the
lowest
competent
bidder,
and
instead,
he
takes
a
bribe,
and
he
awards
the
contract
to
someone
else.
he
--
you
know,
i
can
accept
the
notion
easily
that
he
has
defrauded
--
in
those
terms,
he
has
defrauded
the
public
out
of
its
right
to
have
him
do
that
job.
the
materiality
of
a
nondisclosure
in
that
setting
is
--
is
coherent
in
the
context
of
what
he
did
wrong.
in
other
words,
i
hid
the
fact
that
i
took
a
bribe.
i
took
the
money
in
cash.
i
--
i
put
it
in
the
freezer--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
but
there
are
also--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
don't
know
if
it
does
or
not.
i
mean,
i
guess
there
is
a
fraud
requirement
here.
and
if
somebody
actually
does
that
openly,
i
don't
know
if
you
can
argue
that
he
didn't
--
that
he
didn't
commit
fraud.
but
i
don't
want
to
push
that,
because
that's
not
something
i
have
any
interest
in
--
in
promoting.
[laughter]
but,
in
--
in
any
event,
he
certainly
took
a
bribe.
but
the
--
but
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
the
nondisclosure,
in
the
abstract
--
and
that's
what
the
government
is
charging
here
--
is
impossible
to
evaluate
the
materiality
of.
so--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
--
i
mean,
i
could
argue
with
that,
but
i
don't
need
to,
because
our
principal
submission,
your
honor,
is
that
--
that
we
win
this
case
because
there
is
no
clear
duty
to
disclose.
and
we
win
it
because--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
there
is
no
alaska
law
--
it's
absolutely
clear
and
it
is
not
disputed
here.
the
the
trial
court
ruled
there's
no
duty
in
alaska
law
to
disclose
whatever--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
one
of
the
things
--
well,
the
government
certainly
didn't
offer
anything
other
than
what
it
offered,
and
the
court
looked
at
it
and
the
court
said
there's
no
duty
--
he
went
through
several
pages
of
saying
there
is
no
duty
to
disclose
here,
and
the
government
did
not
appeal.
the
government
didn't
challenge
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
government
said:
well,
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i'm
not
--
i'm
not,
your
honor.
what
i
would
do
is
bump
the
--
bump
the
inquiry
to
the
next
level,
which
is
where
the
court
was
earlier
today.
you
then
have
to
go
to
the
question
about
what
kinds
of
duties
would
suffice.
my
point
is
quite
simple,
and
i
don't
think
it's
evasive.
you
must
have
some
duty--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
--
well,
i
--
you
could
argue
that.
i
don't
think
--
you
certainly
don't
need
to
assume
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
my
position
is
that
you
must
have
some
duty,
and
there's
no
duty
here
other
than
1346.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
you--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
would
you
have
--
you
would
have
to
ask
--
you
would
have
to
ask
a
couple
of
questions,
i
think,
further.
you
would
have
to
ask:
what
kind
of
a
duty
is
it?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
with
a
criminal
penalty
attached?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
it
matters,
your
honor,
because
i
think
what
you
get
into,
when
you
are
evaluating
whether
a
duty
is
sufficient,
is
you
get
into
a
clear
statement--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
the
point
i'm
making
is
all
about
--
it's
all
about
this
court's
clear
statement
rule.
it's
all
about,
when
are
we
going
to
take
congress,
by
using
28
very
vague
words,
to
have
decided
to
mix
up
and
confuse
an
existing
system
of
rules.
let's
say
it's
a
state
ethical
process
where
there's
an
administrative
penalty.
maybe
the
maximum
penalty
is
a
$100
fine;
maybe
the
maximum
penalty
is
censure.
i
talked
about
contracts
earlier.
there's
all
kinds
of
regimes
of
rules
and
duties
that
we
create
in
society.
some
of
them
are
not
even
created
by
government.
some
of
them
are
created
by
professional
associations,
where
if
you
are
a
member
you
owe
a
duty
to
the
professional
association.
which
of
these
are
we
going
to
say
are
duties
of
sufficient
moment
--
and
then
there's
all
of
the
--
the
common
law
corporate
fiduciary
duties.
there
--
there's
a
whole
array
of
duties.
and
the
question
of
which
will
suffice
is
not
an
easy
question--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
--
i
don't
--
that's
one
way
to
say
it,
sufficient
moment,
or
of
a
character
that
makes
it
appropriate.
i
would
say
this:
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
go
down
the
road
and
think
in
terms
of,
well,
the
duties
need
to
be
criminal,
and
if
they
are
criminal,
then
they
at
least
are
duties
that
the
entity
that
created
them
--
it's
(a)
a
government
entity,
it's
a
government
norm,
it
has
criminal
consequences,
and
that
--
that
government
body
thought
this
conduct
was
important
enough
to
give
criminal
penalties
to,
maybe
--
i
don't
--
i
can't
judge
this,
but
maybe
the
court
would
look
at
that
and
say:
well,
certainly,
maybe
we
are
comfortable
with
thinking
that
congress,
with
these
wonderful
28
words,
actually
meant
to
make
the
breach
of
that
criminal
duty
punishable
under
this
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your
question,
your
honor.
i
--
it's
certainly
not
our
position
that,
for
example,
it
would
be--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--uh-huh.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
guess
the
one
thing
i
want
to
make
real
clear
is
that
--
that
we
are
in
no
way
arguing
that,
for
example,
someone
who
violates
the
hobbs
act
and
--
and
does
it
by
using
the
mail
and
otherwise
satisfies
the
fraud
provision,
the
fraud
requirement
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
the
mailing
requirement,
we
are
certainly
not
here
contending
that
you
couldn't
prosecute
him
if
you
wanted
to
under
this
statute.
we're
not
arguing
this
is
only
state
law
violations,
in
any
way.
the
point
is,
there's
got
to
be--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your
honor,
there's
a
story
there
which
i
won't
bore
you
with
much
of,
but
that's
a
question
that
the
government
rewrote
and
the
court
adopted
and
i
actually
filed
a
motion.
we
filed
a
motion
suggesting
a
small
insert,
and
the
small
insert,
which
was
not
adopted,
was
the
point
that
when
there
is
no
federal
statute
requiring
disclosure
--
in
other
words,
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
you
take
them
and
internalize
them,
make
that
an
accurate
question
presented,
but
it's
only
an
accurate
question
because
the
government
made
no
effort
to
come
up
with
a
federal
disclosure
requirement--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
i
think
this
is
the
situation
--
it's
certainly
true
--
the
government
cites
the
jerome
case
as
well
for
the
general
proposition
that
you
don't
take
a
federal
statute
and
just
leap
off
and
start
applying
state
law
norms.
but
--
but
when
the
inherent
nature
of
the
statute,
like
this
one,
which
says
--
we're
talking
about
public
officials;
mostly
we're
talking
about
state
officials;
we're
talking
about
rights,
and
therefore,
we're
talking
about
duties
--
most
of
the
legal
duties
--
if
you
are
going
to
be
requiring
legal
duties,
most
of
the
legal
duties
that
a
state
official
owes
are
state
law
duties.
he
owes
them
on
account
of
his
role
in
the
state
government.
plus,
we
are
talking
about
the
federal
government,
the
federal
criminal
statute,
injecting
itself
into
the
relationship
of
state
officials
with
their
citizens
and
their
government.
and
so
the
notion
that
you
--
you
know,
there's
the
de
sylva
case
from
1956,
there's
the
kamen
case,
the
brosnan
case
--
these
are
all
cases
where
the
court
has
recognized
a
sensitivity
about
there
are
times
when
it
makes
sense
to
look
to,
or
at
least
consider
as
one
of
the
elements,
state
law
norms.
and
that's
really
all
we
are
saying
here,
is
that
state
law
rules,
perhaps,
could
be
sufficient.
but
i
want
to
just
emphasize,
again,
we
are
not
here
--
i'm
--
i'm
less
helpful
to
you
than
perhaps
i
should
be,
but
we
have
a
case
to
argue.
and
our
case
should
win
on
the
simple
ground
that
the
government
has
cited
no
real
direct,
you
know,
disclosure
obligation.
all
they
have
cited,
and
all
they
want
to
rely
on,
are
the
words
of
1346.
now,
that
violates
this
court's
clear
statement
rule,
going
in
and
messing
around
with
alaska's
existing
rules
of
when
you
have
to
disclose
and
when
you
don't.
can
congress
really
have
thought
about
that
and
meant
to
do
that?
i'm
sure
not.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
there's
--
there's
an
argument
to
be
made
that
the
--
that
the
government
could
pursue,
and
i
don't
want
to
say
they
could,
but
if
it's
a
criminal
statute,
there's
an
argument
the
government
could
pursue
their
case
on
that
theory.
it's
not
a
disclosure
theory.
it's
a
theory
about
--
you
know,
it's
like
a
bribe.
it's
like,
the
state
said
you
can't
do
x;
you
did
x,
and
you
fraudulently
did
x--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
--
the
first
thing
i
want
to
say
is
that
i
think
that
is
counterfactual,
and
they
were
talking
about
bribery.
bribery
is
basically
flatly
illegal
in
every
state.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
if
it's
not
illegal--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--if
it's
not
illegal,
then
i
would
say
that
there
has
to
be
--
the
conduct
he
engaged
in
must
be
illegal
under
some
law
or
it
--
he
didn't
breach
a
duty.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i'm
sorry?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
alaska
law.
it
has
got
to
be
some
law,
and
it
can't
be
1346.
the
other
problem
with
it,
i
want
to
say
quickly
and
then
sit
down,
is
--
is
this
is
making
federal
common
law.
this
is
courts
coming
in
and
saying:
you
must
disclose
this
and
this
and
this,
in
these
circumstances
and
not
in
those.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
would
say
that
--
that
--
yes,
that
is
my
answer.
and
my
answer
is
that
because
what
you
have
to
find
is
that
this
person
breached
a
duty.
if
what
he
did
was
perfectly
legal
under
the
state
law
where
he
was,
just
hypothetical
--
hard
to
imagine
--
if
he's
committing
bribery.
hard
to
imagine.
not
true
in
reality,
but
if
that
were
true,
he
hasn't
violated
any
duty
there.
is
there
a
federal
duty
that
that
act
of
taking
a
bribe
violates?
well,
if
there
is,
then
you
can
prosecute
it,
and
if
there
is
not,
then
you
can't.
and
what
i'm
saying
is,
you
can't
make
up
a
duty
out
of
28
words
in
1346.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
four
quick
points
i'd
like
to
make.
the
first
one
is
that
mcnally
is
a
case
--
there
were
issues
about
the
jury
instructions,
but
the
basic
fact
pattern
was
clear.
it
was
a
kickback
scheme.
it
was
illegal
under
the
kentucky
constitution.
there's
no
question
that
if
it
were
charged
properly,
it
could
be
convicted,
and
that's
clear
i
think
at
page
11
of
our
yellow
brief.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
this
talk
about
whether
or
not
petitioner
violated
the
statute
about
voting
when
he
was
in
negotiations
--
number
one,
the
first
answer
to
that
is
the
government
is
perfectly
free
to
prove
that
case
if
they
want
to;
that's
not
before
the
court.
that's
--
that's
a
different
theory
that
they
can
pursue.
it's
not
the
disclosure
theory.
but
just
by
the
way,
he
didn't
violate
it,
and
the
reason
he
didn't
violate
it,
particularly
in
light
of
what
mr.
dreeben
has
said
--
first
of
all
we
don't
think
he
was
in
negotiations.
he
sent
a
letter.
there
was
never
an
offer
either
way.
there
weren't
negotiations,
and
that's
been
something
that
has
been
talked
about
in
the
court.
secondly,
he
voted;
when
he
voted
he
actually
ended
up
voting
twice
on
the
bill
in
a
form
that
--
that
veco
didn't
want.
so
he
actually
--
and
i
learned
today
--
and
this
is
all,
you
know,
shifting
sands
--
that
he
has
to
have
voted
for
the
--
the
way
that
the
conflicting
interest
would
have
had
him
vote.
so
there's
not,
i
think,
a
problem
there.
if
they
want
to
pursue
that,
go
to
it.
they
have
every
right
to.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes.
yes,
and
they
have
the
right--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--to
pursue
it.
and
--
and
the
third
point
i
want
to
make
is
--
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
about
this
question
with
regard
to
what
--
what
the
issue
was
in
the
court
below.
and
i
would
simply
direct
a
few
references
to
the
--
and
i'll
read
them
very
quickly.
but
23a
--
these
are
all
the
district
court
opinion:
23a,
the
district
court
says
he
is
dealing
with
the
more
general
proposition
--
the
government's
more
general
proposition
--
that
honest
services
fraud
may
be
proved
by
showing
a
violation
of
the
duty
to
disclose.
then
on
29a,
the
district
court
says
"the
proposition
advanced
by
the
united
states,
that
honest
services
may
be
proved
by
establishing
that
a
public
official
knowingly
concealed
a
conflict
of
interest.
"
period.
then,
on
36a,
at
the
end
the
court
says,
you
can
bring
any
other
theory
you
want
other
than
the
nondisclosure
theory.
now,
did
the
government
object?
did
the
government
at
any
time
say,
oh,
no,
that's
not
our
theory?
no.
they
didn't;
they
adopted
that,
and
that's
the
theory
they
argued
on
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
that's
exactly
the
theory
that
the
ninth
circuit
talked
about
when
it
has
these
two
forms
of
core
conduct,
one
of
which
is
--
is
the
conduct
about
failing
to
disclose
material
information,
period.
not
in
doing
anything
else,
just
failing
to
disclose
material
information
re
a
conflict.
finally,
the
government
in
this
court
has
itself
argued
the
case
in
a
way
that
i
think
concedes
the
point.
and
--
and
that
is,
essentially,
if
you
look
at
the
main
heading
in
their
brief
on
page
13,
their
point
is
--
they
finally
say
this,
and
then
i
think
they
contradict
themselves
elsewhere,
but
they
say
in
their
heading
a
"state
official's
violation
of
the
honest
services
statute
by
taking
official
action
while
intentionally
concealing
a
material
conflict
of
interest.
"
that's
it.
no
action
for--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
i
think
they
made
their
argument.
they
lost
in
the
trial
court.
they
are
pursuing
this
extreme,
overreaching
theory
that
--
that
they
only
can
get
to
by
the
--
by
the
extravagant
language
in
the
--
in
the
pre-mcnally
cases.
thank
you,
your
honor.
