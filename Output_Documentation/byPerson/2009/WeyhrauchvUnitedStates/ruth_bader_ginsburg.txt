justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
real
problem
with
your
approach,
which
i
take
it
is
you
have
to
find
these
duties
in
state
law,
is
that
some
states
will
classify
the
same
conduct
as
a
felony
that
another
will
classify
as
a
misdemeanor.
so
that
line
won't
work.
and
then
some
states
will
make
something
criminal
that
other
states
won't.
so
you're
going
to
have,
depending
on
geography,
people
potentially
subject
to
a
20-year
term
because
of
the
particularities
of
--
of
a
--
the
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
asking
us
to
say
state
law
is
the
reference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
no
objection
to
what
they
call
the
quid
pro
quo
theory;
that
is,
i
--
i
want
you
to
hire
me
after
i
leave
the
legislature,
and
in
return,
i'm
going
to
see
what
i
can
do
to
keep
the
tax
level
low
on
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
then
i
don't
understand
your
question
presented.
i
thought
the
question
presented
is:
must
the
government
prove
the
defendant
violated
a
disclosure
duty
imposed
by
state
law?
what
you've
been
arguing
isn't
in
sync
with
what
i
thought
the
question
presented
was:
must
you
look
for
the
duty
to
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
asking
for
a
state
law
reference,
and
that
brings
up
the
problem
of
the
variety
of
state
law.
and
we
do
have
in
the
mail
fraud
property
area
a
decision,
the
cleveland
decision--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
says:
don't
look
to
how
the
states
define
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
should
be
a
uniform
federal
definition.
why
--
if
we
have
done
that,
the
mail
fraud
statute
in
--
in
connection
with
property,
why
shouldn't
we
do
it
also
with
honest
services?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
we
do
that,
mr.
dreeben--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dreeben,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
about
this
case
particularly:
one
thing
that
the
prosecutor
did,
one
thing
that
the
ninth
circuit
did.
so
before
we
get
to
your
larger
theory
of
anything,
we
have
a
particular
case
to
deal
with.
we
have
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney
who
came
to
the
judge
and
said,
we
have
alternate
theories
of
this
case.
one
is
the
quid
pro
quo
theory;
the
other
--
and
i
am
reading
from
42
of
the
appendix
--
is
that
"a
public
official
can
be
found
guilty
of
honest
services
fraud,
irrespective
of
whether
the
public
official
took
any
act
thereafter.
"
just
the
bare
nondisclosure.
that
was
what
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
asking
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
must
agree
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong,
at
least
in
this
particular
--
this
--
i'm
now
reading
from
19a.
one
is
bribe,
and
that's
--
everyone
seems
to
agree
that
that
could
come
within
the
statute.
the
second
is
(2)
nondisclosure
of
material
information.
period.
that's
got
to
be
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
an
opinion
that's
going
to
govern
district
judges
in
the
ninth
circuit.
so
i
take
it
that
your
answer
is
that
nondisclosure
of
material
information
certainly
is
not
enough--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
problem
is
that
--
that,
even
if
the
u.s.
attorney
got
it
right
in
the
end,
if
the
u.s.
attorney
could
think
that
all
that's
involved
is
nondisclosure,
even
if
no
action
is
taken
thereafter,
the
u.s.
attorney
could
write
that
down
twice,
that
suggests
that
this
statute
is
open
to
a
high
degree
of
interpretation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
finally,
i
announced
the
decisions
in
numbers
08-1196
weyhrauch
v.
united
states.
in
this
case
the
court
states
unanimously
and
per
curium,
the
judgment
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
united
states,
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
for
further
consideration
in
