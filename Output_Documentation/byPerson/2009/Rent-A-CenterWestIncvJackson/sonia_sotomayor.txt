justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
is
your
problem
with
unconscionability
being
--
as
described
by
the
chief
justice
or
justice
scalia,
being
forced
to
or
coerced
into
signing
something
--
that's
okay
for
the
courts,
but
this
type
of
argument
that
goes
to
the
unfairness
of
the
process,
that's
for
the
arbitrator;
is
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
--
isn't
that
an
unwieldy
rule?
isn't
your
quarrel
with
what
the
court
defined
as
remissible
unconscionability
as
a
legal
matter,
as
opposed
to
trying
to
parse
out
what
unconscionability
means
otherwise?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
just
gave
you
one
that
didn't:
if
someone
was
forced
into
signing
the
agreement
in
an
unconscionable
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
describe
for
us
what
is
unconscionable
about
this
contract?
what
is
your
claim
of
unconscionability?
he
says
it's
not
arbitration
per
se;
it's
just
certain
of
the
provisions
here;
if
you
change
the
provisions,
i'm
happy
with
arbitration.
is
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
think
i
heard
justice
kennedy's
question
to
be
--
let's
not
confuse
the
contract
as
a
whole.
there's
only
one
contract
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
an
attack
on
the
--
as
i
think
justice
breyer
noted,
you
--
an
argument
that
it's
one-sided
goes
to
the
entire
arbitration
agreement.
i
don't
want
to
arbitrate
because
that's
not
what
i
chose
to
do
freely.
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that,
you
say,
is
for
the
court.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
difference
here
is
that
there
are
provisions
within
how
the
arbitration
is
going
to
be
held
that,
standing
alone,
you
think
are
unconscionable,
even
though
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
is
not.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
your
allegation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
see,
that's
what
i'm
confused
by,
because
when
i
first
asked
you
this
question,
you
said:
i
would
be
happy
to
arbitrate
if
the
court
struck
the
discovery
provision
and,
i
guess,
the
fees
provision.
which
answer
are
you
giving
me?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
let's
assume--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--okay.
that
--
now
i
understand
that
part
of
your
argument.
but
let's
assume
that
that
wasn't
nevada
law,
that
nevada
law
would
say
severability
works,
and
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
and
all
we
have
to
or
could
do
is
strike
the
unfair
provisions.
let's
assume
that
situation.
who
decides
whether
to
strike
the
unfair
provisions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
--
i
--
i
keep
going
back
to
my
initial
question
to
you,
is
you
want
to
parse
out
what
making
is
from
unconscionability,
and
you
want
us
to
say,
well,
if
it's
too
onerous
a
fee
for
arbitration,
that
goes
to
the
making,
because
you're
depriving
the
party
of
--
of
an
arbitration
forum.
if
it's
discovery,
that
doesn't
go
to
depriving
them
of
anything
because
the
arbitrator
could
give
them
more
discovery
if
he
or
she
chose.
am
i
correct,
this
is
your
argument?
