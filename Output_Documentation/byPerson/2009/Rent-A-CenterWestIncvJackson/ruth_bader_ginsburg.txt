but
if
--
if
fraud
in
the
inducement,
i
take
it,
is
considered
--
even
if
you
have
a
very
broad
arbitration
clause,
as
we
do
here,
fraud
in
the
inducement
is
considered
a
question
for
the
court,
not
the
arbitrator;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
should
unconscionability
be
treated
differently?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
specific
examples
he
gave,
that
the
--
just
take
that
the
--
that
the
employee
must
bear
all
the
costs
of
the
arbitration,
win
or
lose,
that's
the
provision.
would
that
provision
be
enough
to
make
the
issue
one
for
the
court
rather
than
the
arbitrator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it?
we
don't
need
the
"if".
tell
me
whether
you
think
a
provision
saying
the
employee
under
any
and
all
circumstances
pays
all
costs
--
would
that
provision
make
this
question
of
unconscionability
one
for
the
court
rather
than
the
arbitrator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
of
the
arbitration
agreement,
not
the
employment
contract
as
a
whole.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
friedman,
this
contract
is
--
is
unusual
in
that,
as
judge
hall
said,
it
was
more
employee-friendly
than
most.
it
had
a
clause
--
it
had
a
provision
for
back-end
review
with
the
court.
the
review
--
at
the
end
of
the
line,
there
was
to
be
court
review,
and
as
the
parties
said,
it
should
be
just
like
review
of
a
district
court
decision,
a
much
--
much
more
focused
review
than
would
be
in
the
case
of
an
arbitration
agreement.
now,
that
clause
comes
out
because
of
our
decision
in
hall.
that
leaves
the
--
the
arbitration
agreement
in
--
in
an
imbalance.
there
was
court
review
assured
at
the
back
end.
so
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say
the
parties
contemplated
vigorous
court
review;
if
it
can't
be
had
at
the
back
end,
it
should
be
had
at
the
front
end?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
very
limited
review.
but
the
parties
to
this
agreement
put
in
a
clause
that
provided
for
the
standard
review,
not
the
very
limited
review
that
the
arbitration
act
calls
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
it
be
in
the
district
court?
we
didn't
decide
hall
street
until
after
the
district
court
was
finished
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
making,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia,
the
question
--
he
said,
well,
they
didn't
raise
it.
they
didn't
raise
that
with
this
provision
out,
it
was
an
essential
provision,
so
the
contract
was
void.
they
had
no
reason
to
make
that
in
the
district
court
because
hall
street
was
not
yet
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
a
big
concession,
because
i
thought,
as
the
first
circuit
said,
if
argument
is
the
--
the
contract
is
illusory,
that
goes
to
the
court,
but
here
the
only
claim
is
unconscionability.
that's
a
question
of
fairness.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
they
--
if
they
made
that
concession,
so
what,
under
the
first
circuit's
reading?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
silverberg,
the
section
2
on
which
you
place
much
emphasis
just
says
that
agreements
are
enforceable
save
on
such
grounds
as
exist
in
law
or
equity
for
revocation
of
a
contract.
but
the
section
2
doesn't
say
any
--
anything
about
who
decides
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
silverberg--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
that,
underlying
your
whole
case
i
think
is
the
notion
that
this
is
an
adhesion
contract;
it's
a
take-it-or-leave-it
contract,
very
common
in
consumer,
credit
card
agreements,
in
employment
contracts,
that
one
party
has
no
say
except
to
sign
or
not
to
sign.
are
all
those
contracts
subject
to
the
unconscionability
argument
that
you're
making
or
only
some
of
them?
and
if
only
some,
which
ones?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
clause
is
not
of
that
kind,
and
you've
singled
out
three
things
that
made
it
unconscionable.
one,
the
fee
provision,
the
splitting
fees,
that
the
court
rejected.
so
the
only
two
left
is
the
one-sided
aspect
of
it
and
the
limited
discovery.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
limited
discovery
clause,
that
that
was
quite
common
to
say
we're
not
--
we
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
the
massive
discovery
you
can
get
in
a
--
in
a
civil
proceeding.
is
there
something
unusual
about
limiting
discovery
to
documents?
