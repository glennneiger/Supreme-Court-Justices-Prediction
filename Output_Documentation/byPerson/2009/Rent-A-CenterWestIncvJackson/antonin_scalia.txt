justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
could
argue
that
on
its
face
the
agreement
is
so
one-sided,
so
unconscionable,
that
one
of
the
parties
must
have
been
coerced
into
signing
it.
i
guess
you
could
make
that
argument,
can't
--
couldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
--
has
that
argument
been
made
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
argument
made
that
because
it
was
so
unconscionable,
the
employee
must
have
been
coerced
into
making
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
it
--
it
had
been
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
mean,
if
--
if
the
argument
is
made
--
i
gather
it
wasn't
made
here,
but
if
the
argument
is
made
that
this
agreement
was
not
voluntary,
and
the
evidence
of
that
involuntariness
is
how
outrageously
unfair
it
is
--
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
enough
evidence.
you
may
need
some
other
stuff
as
well
to
--
to
persuade
a
court.
but
if
that
is
the
argument,
that
the
one-sidedness
is
evidence
that
the
agreement
was
not
voluntary,
i
don't
see
how
that's
for
the
arbitrator.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that
could
be
used
along
with
other
evidence?
i
think
all
you're
saying
is
that
it
is
not
in
and
of
itself
enough,
that
every
unfair
agreement
is
not
a
coerced
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
use
it
as
evidence
if
there's
other
evidence
supporting
that.
couldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no.
can
you
use
that
in
addition
to
other
evidence
to
show
that
the
agreement
was
not
voluntary?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
that
a
contract
cannot
be
unconscionable
unless
it
was
coerced,
that
a
finding
of
unconscionability
is
the
same
as
a
finding
of
coercion?
you
don't
agree
with
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--once
again,
has
this
argument
been
made
here?
i
thought
that
the
only
basis
was
unconscionability.
i
suppose
you
could
have
made
the
argument
that
the
contract
is
void
because
one
of
its
essential
provisions
has
been
rendered
unlawful
and,
therefore
--
and
is
not
severable,
and,
therefore,
the
whole
contract
fails.
i
suppose
you
could
make
that
argument.
that
hasn't
been
made,
has
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they
make
it
here
now?
can
they
make
--
i
mean,
even
if
they
had
--
you
know,
even
if
there
was
no
reason
to
make
it
in
the
district
court,
is
the
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
since
they
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
make
it
in
the
district
court,
they
can
make
it
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
--
is
that
right?
is
the
arbitrator
free
to
decide
unconscionability
in
a
vacuum
without
taking
into
account
state
law
at
all?
and
doesn't
he
get
reviewed
afterwards
by
the
state
court
on
the
basis
of
a
much
more
lenient
standard
than
--
than
if
the
court
decided
it
de
novo.
but
can
he
really
disregard
state
law
regarding
unconscionability?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
--
i
mean,
you
--
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
if
we
allow
this
to
go
to
the
arbitrator,
the
arbitrator
can
simply
disregard
the
question
of
unconscionability.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
not
my
understanding.
my
understanding
is
that
he's
--
he
is
obliged
to
take
account
of
state
law
regarding
unconscionability,
but
it's
going
to
be
his
call,
as
it
would
be
the
district
judge's
call
if
this
had
gone
to
court,
whether
in
fact
this
is
unconscionable.
afterwards,
there
will
be
court
review.
and
if
he
has
totally
disregarded
all
state
law
regarding
unconscionability,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
you
have
a
basis
to
set
aside
the
--
the
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
mean
--
does
that
mean
he
can
disregard
--
let's
assume
the
contract
is
a
contract
to
maim.
i
mean,
it
--
you
know,
it's
--
it's
like
--
it's
a
shylock
contract,
okay?
he's
going
to
be
able
to
exact
a
pound
of
flesh.
now,
there
are
state
laws
which
invalidate
contracts
to
maim.
do
you
think
that
the
arbitrator
can
ignore
that,
and
say,
well,
you
know,
i
don't
really
think
it's
so
bad;
a
pound
of
flesh
sounds
reasonable
to
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
he
ignore
the
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
you
don't
think
a
state
court
would
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
set
aside
an
arbitration
that
allowed
a
--
a
pound
of
flesh?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
have
a
misunderstanding
of
the
law,
then,
if
that's
what
you
believe.
i
--
i
think
there's
no
doubt
what
would
happen
in
that
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wrote
that,
didn't
you?
didn't
you
write
that
opinion?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
nevada
law
says
you
cannot
--
you
cannot
fire
somebody
for
coming
in
late
to
work
any
fewer
than
10
times,
all
right?
and
an
individual
is
fired.
he
goes
to
arbitration,
or
at
least
the
company
tries
to
take
him
to
arbitration
on
it.
and
he
says,
no,
because
i
was
fired
in
violation
of
nevada
law.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
that
--
that
that
case
would
have
to
go
immediately
to
court
and
could
not
submit
to
the
arbitrator
the
issue
of
whether
indeed
he
was
fired
for
coming
less
than
10
times,
and
indeed
whether
if
he
was
coming
in
less
than
10
times,
that
would
be
an
invalid
basis
for
a
dismissal?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
your
--
your
position
seems
to
be
that
unconscionability
is
the
same
as
coercion
in
the
making
of
the
agreement.
and
i
don't
know
that
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
care
what
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
care
what
we
said
in
dictum.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
unconscionability
is
the
same
as
duress
or
the
same
as
fraud--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you
can
--
you
can
be
a
stupid
person
who
voluntarily
signs
an
unconscionable
contract.
now,
the
courts
may
protect
you
because
you're
stupid,
but
you
haven't
been
coerced.
is
there
no
distinction
between
unconscionability
and
coercion?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
would
say
all
unconscionability
challenges,
if
you
have
an
agreement
that's
as
clear
as
this
one,
would
go
to
the
arbitrator.
which
ones
would
have
to
go
to
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
much
use
signing
an
arbitration
agreement
then,
not
much
use
for
the
employer.
he's
going
to
end
up
in
court
anyway.
every
one
of
them
will
be
acknowledge
as
unconscionable.
so
what's
the
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
kiss
good-bye
to
arbitration.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
amici
certainly
claim
the
contrary.
the
chamber
of
commerce
claims
that
this
is
what's
happening
and
that
it
has
been
a
snowballing
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
no
access
to
arbitration,
there's
no
way
that
you
can
leave
that
issue
to
the
arbitrator,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
never
get
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
2007,
respondent
antonio
jackson
filed
an
employment
discrimination
suit
in
federal
court
against
his
former
employer,
petitioner,
rent-a-center
west
incorporated.
rent-a-center
filed
a
motion
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
dismiss
or
stay
the
proceedings
and
to
compel
arbitration,
based
on
the
mutual
agreement
to
arbitrate
which
jackson
had
signed
as
a
condition
of
his
employment.
that
agreement
provided
for
arbitration
of
all
past,
present
or
future
disputes
arising
out
of
jackson's
employment
with
rent-a-center.
the
agreement
also
provided
in
a
separate
provision
that
the
arbitrator
shall
have
exclusive
authority
to
resolve
disputes
about
the
enforceability
of
the
agreement.
jackson
resisted
arbitration.
he
claimed
that
the
agreement
was
unenforceable
because
it
was
unconscionable
under
nevada
law.
rent-a-center
replied
that
the
agreement
assigned
resolution
of
the
question
of
unconscionability
which
is
a
question
of
enforceability
to
the
arbitrator.
the
district
court
granted
rent-a-center's
motion
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
in
relevant
part.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
the
faa,
federal
arbitration
act
reflects
the
fundamental
principle
that
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
contract.
section
2
of
the
act
provides
that
“a
written
provision
in
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce
to
settled
by
arbitration.
a
controversy
thereafter
arising
out
of
such
contract
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable
and
unenforceable
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exists
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.”
courts
must
enforce
arbitration
agreements
according
to
their
terms,
in
another
words,
except
that
arbitration
agreements
like
other
contracts
may
be
invalidated
by
generally
applicable
contract
defenses
such
as
fraud,
duress
or
unconscionability.
as
i
mentioned
earlier
the
arbitration
agreement
at
issue
here
includes
two
relevant
written
provisions
to
in
the
words
of
section
2
settled
by
arbitration,
a
controversy.
the
first
is
the
provision
stating
that
disputes
relating
to
jackson's
employment
are
subject
to
arbitration
and
the
second
is
the
provision
stating
that
disputes
regarding
the
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
agreement
itself
are
subject
to
arbitration.
the
current
controversy
between
the
parties
whether
the
agreement
is
unenforceable
because
it
is
unconscionable,
is
governed
by
the
second
provision
and
it
is
that
provision
which
rent-a-center
asks
us
to
enforce.
i
will
call
it
the
delegation
provision
because
it
delegates
resolution
of
the
enforceability
controversy
to
the
arbitrator.
enforceability
is
a
so-called
gateway
question,
like
the
question
of
whether
the
agreement
was
ever
in
fact
entered
into,
it
has
to
be
answered
before
applying
the
arbitration
agreement.
our
cases
have
imposed
a
special
requirement
upon
agreements
to
arbitrate
gateway
issues.
before
those
gateway
issues
can
be
taken
away
from
the
courts,
there
must
be
“clear
and
unmistakable
evidence”
that
the
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate.
the
delegation
provision
here
satisfies
that
heighten
requirement
because
as
both
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
found,
its
text
clearly
and
unmistakably
provides
that
the
arbitrator
will
decide
questions
of
enforceability
and
once
that
heightened
requirement
is
satisfied,
the
faa
operates
on
that
additional
arbitration
agreement
just
as
it
does
on
any
other.
it
is
important
for
purposes
of
this
case
to
distinguish
between
two
types
of
validity
challenges
under
section
2.
one
type
challenge
is
specifically
the
validity
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
the
other
challenge
is
the
whole
contract
of
which
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
is
merely
a
part.
in
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
the
case
called
prima
paint
corporation
versus
flood
&
conklin
manufacturing
company,
we
held
that
only
the
first
type
of
challenge,
namely
a
challenge
specifically
to
the
validity
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
can
invalidate
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
that
is
to
say
an
arbitration
provision
is
severable
from
the
remainder
of
the
contract
and
stands
on
its
own
feet.
this
case
differs
from
the
prima
paint
line
of
cases
because
the
arbitration
provisions
sought
to
be
enforced
in
those
cases
were
contained
in
contracts
unrelated
to
arbitration,
employment
contracts
for
example
that
had
an
arbitration
provision.
whereas
in
this
case,
the
delegation
clause
is
part
of
an
agreement
that
is
itself
entirely
an
arbitration
agreement,
but
that
makes
no
difference.
application
of
the
severability
rule
does
not
depend
on
the
substance
of
the
remainder
of
the
contract.
section
2
operates
on
the
written
provision
to
“settle
by
arbitration
a
controversy"
that
the
party
seeks
to
enforce.
thus
unless
jackson
challenged
the
delegation
provision
specifically,
we
must
treat
it
as
valid
under
section
2
and
enforce
--sending
the
question
of
enforceability
to
the
arbitrator.
the
district
court
correctly
concluded
that
jackson
challenged
only
the
validity
of
the
contract
as
a
whole.
his
filings
before
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
confirmed
this.
he
argued
that
the
entire
agreement
and
the
arbitration
agreement
as
a
whole
were
unconscionable.
he
repeated
those
arguments
in
this
court.
in
addition,
for
first
time
in
his
brief
to
this
court,
he
claimed
that
the
delegation
provision
specifically
was
unconscionable.
he
raised
that
challenge
too
late
and
we
will
not
consider
it.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
breyer
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
