justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
post-formation?
arguably,
the
--
one
of
the
parties
has
such
a
strong
hand
that
it
forces
the
other
party
just
to
decide.
it's
almost
like
--
duress
would
certainly
be
for
the
court,
would
it
not,
if
it's
a
formation
issue
like
justice
ginsburg
indicated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
procedural
unconscionability,
but
this
is
--
as
justice
ginsburg
indicates,
it's
not
clear
to
me
why
this
isn't
a
formation
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
understand
--
and
we
can
ask
the
respondent.
but,
as
you
understand
jackson's
case,
is
he
saying
that
part
of
the
clause,
part
of
the
arbitration
clause,
is
unconscionable,
that
the
whole
clause
is
unconscionable
or
that
the
whole
contract
is
unconscionable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
complaint
is
a
bare-bones
complaint,
and
i
don't
know
if
there's
anything
in
the
pleadings
that
reflects
what
his
answer
to
that
question
would
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
after
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--after
this
suit
was
filed
and
both
parties
are
going
up
the
steps
to
the
court,
could
the
attorneys
and
the
parties
stop
and
say
let's
arbitrate
this
issue
of
unconscionability
and
pick
an
arbitrator?
could
they
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
then
--
then
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
the
employee
loses.
he
says:
oh,
you
have
to
have
an
open
door;
this
was
--
this
was
not
properly
before
the
arbitrator.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because,
you
see,
if
you
say
yes,
that
they
can
arbitrate
this,
then
the
question
is
why
can't
they
do
it
when
the
contract's
signed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
they
can
put
that
to
an
arbitrator.
if
that's
so,
how
can
you
prevail
in
this
case
if
the
agreement
clearly
comprehends
submission
of
this
issue
to
the
arbitrator?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
asking,
assume
you
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
which
is
the
stronger
case
for
arbitration?
case
one,
you
attack
the
arbitration
clause
only,
part
of
the
arbitration
contract
only,
as
being
unconscionable.
case
two,
you
attack
the
whole
agreement
as
being
unconscionable.
do
those
both
stand
on
the
same
footing,
or
is
one
a
stronger
case
for
submission
to
the
court
than
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
find
that
somewhat
paradoxical,
but
i
--
i
agree
that
that
--
that
that's
the
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
do
go
to
the
state
court,
suppose
the
state
court
says:
i
can't
really
decide
this
question
about
the
one
clause
unless
i
determine
the
conscionability
or
the
unconscionability
of
the
entire
contract,
and
i
now
proceed
to
do
that.
do
you
have
to
wait
and
say:
stop,
you
can't
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
the
state
court
judge
says
that
he
has
to
look
at
the
whole
contract.
do
you
say:
oh,
i'm
sorry
to
bother
you;
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
arbitrator
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
--
no,
it's
a
hypothetical
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
your
position
be
in
the
hypothetical
case,
representing
your
client?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
do
you
think
the
judge
should
decide
as
between
those
two
possibilities?
