i'm
a
little
puzzled.
what
was
the
argument
that
was
made?
why
was
it
unconscionable,
if
not
for
that
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
no
matter
how
one-sided?
i
mean,
suppose
the
agreement
provided
that
the
employee
shall
pay
all
the
costs
of
arbitration
no
matter
who
wins
and
also
at
the
end
of
the
arbitration
shall
pay
a
penalty
if
he
fails
to
--
it
seems
to
me
you
could
have
a
really
one-sided
--
that
would
not
be
admissible
on
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
kind
of
elementary
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
cases
out
there
that
hold
that
an
agreement
can
be
partially
unconscionable,
that
it's
unconscionable
for
some
clauses
but
not
in
its
--
in
its
entirety?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
are
cases
that
--
that
draw
that
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
cases
drawing
that
very
elementary
distinction?
