chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-497,
rent-a-center
west
v.
jackson.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
to
the
question
of
which
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitrate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
the
question
of
which
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitrate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
suppose
that
the
substance
of
the
agreement
--
maybe
this
is
just
the
same
question
as
justice
scalia's.
i
suppose
the
substance
of
the
agreement
is
evidence
--
could
be
evidence
on
the
unconscionability
at
formation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
is
for
the
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
the
point
is
--
it's
not
that.
it
would
be
the
--
the
provisions
are
so
one-sided
that
you
may
assume
from
that
that
the
formation
was
not
voluntary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
position
is
that
the
arbitrator
gets
to
decide
questions
of
unconscionability,
but
the
court
gets
to
decide
whether
the
arbitrator
can
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
the
answer
to
your
--
the
answer
to
your
answer
would
be,
well
then,
the
--
you're
more
likely
to
win
on
that
question.
obviously,
you
are
going
to
lose
on
the
gun
to
the
head,
but
if
it's
simply
the
economic
inequality
or
whatever,
under
the
state
law
you're
probably
going
to
prevail,
and
they
will
say
there
is
a
valid
contract.
i
thought
the
--
your
--
your
whole
point
was
simply
it's
all
or
nothing.
the
courts
get
to
decide
is
there
a
valid
contract
or
is
there
not.
and
once
they
decide
there
is,
then
everything
else
about
unconscionability
of
particular
clauses
is
for
the
arbitrator.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
silverberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
the
issue
would
be
--
it's
odd
to
say,
i
think,
that
if
you
have
10
provisions,
some
are
unconscionable
and
some
are
not.
the
issue
would
be
whether
there
is
unconscionability
in
the
making
of
the
whole
contract.
in
other
words,
it's
the
same
question
i
asked
your
friend:
why
isn't
it
all
or
nothing?
if
it
was
--
if
there
was
no
unconscionability
in
the
making,
then
the
arbitrator
decides.
if
there
was
unconscionability
in
the
making,
then
--
then
the
arbitrator
doesn't
decide
anything.
questions
1
through
10,
not
simply,
you
know,
1,
8,
and
9.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
my
point
is
that
once
you
get
past
that
gateway
question
of
whether
the
formation
of
the
contract
was
not
unconscionable,
then
claims
that
particular
provisions
were
unconscionable
are
by
definition
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
that
can't
be
right.
the
--
how
can
you
say
there's
no
problem
agreeing
to
arbitrate,
no
imbalance
in
bargaining
authority
whatever,
but
then
say,
oh,
but
these
procedures
are
unconscionable?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
procedures
are
there,
and
the
party,
the
employee,
whatever,
can
look
at
those.
and
if
he
says,
well,
that's
unconscionable,
you
don't
sign
the
agreement
as
a
whole.
but
once
you
are
--
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound.
if
you
agree
to
arbitrate,
then
it's
at
least
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide
particular
provisions,
whether
they're
unconscionable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
you're
arguing
in
the
alternative.
but
the
one
argument
that
we
get
to
pick
out
the
provisions
we
don't
like
and
say
those
are
unconscionable,
but
the
agreement
as
a
whole
is
not
--
that
seems
to
me
illogical.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
a
matter
--
it
may
be
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
the
open
question
is
who
gets
to
decide
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
arbitrators
decide
matters
of
state
law
all
the
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
make
a
difference
in
response
to
justice
stevens's
hypothetical
that
there
is
a
provision
saying
the
arbitrator
will
decide
the
conscionability
of
all
clauses?
the
arbitrator
may
decide
that
clauses
2
and
8
are
unconscionable,
but
if
there's
an
agreement
and
it's
not
unconscionable
that
the
arbitrator
will
decide,
then
the
arbitrator
decides
all
of
them,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
just
a
follow-up
on
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
to
you
where
he
had
the
first
agreement
and
then
the
issue
to
the
second?
you
said
you've
got
to
leave
the
door
open.
the
door
open
on
the
second
agreement
or
on
the
first
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
friedman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
friedman,
mr.
silverberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
09-497,
the
rent-a-center
west
versus
jackson.
