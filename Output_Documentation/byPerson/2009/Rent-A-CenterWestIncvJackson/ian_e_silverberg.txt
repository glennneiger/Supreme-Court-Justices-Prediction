mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
would
have
the
court
adopt
a
rule
whereby
agreements
to
arbitrate
are
presumed
enforceable
before
their
validity
has
been
determined
by
a
court
under
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
they
would
have
people
like
mr.
jackson
waive
their
right
to
go
to
court
through
the
use
of
a
clause
delegating
this
judicial
function
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
yes,
your
honor,
that
--
that
what
is
unconscionable
about
this
is
it's
unusually
one-sided
in
that
the
issues
that
are
most
important
to
mr.
jackson,
such
as
his
racial
discrimination
case,
he
is
required
to
arbitrate,
but
those
issues
that
might
be
most
important
to
the
petitioner,
such
as
trade
secrets
and
unfair
competition,
they
are
not
bound
to
arbitrate.
so--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
the
--
the
threshold
determination
must
first
be
made
by
the
court
under
section
2
as
to
whether
there
is
unconscionability
either
of
the
entire
agreement
or
any
of
the
provisions.
it
would
then,
assuming
that
were
found,
that
some
provisions
were
in
fact
unconscionable,
it
would
be
on
state
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
entire
agreement
gets
thrown
out--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--no,
we
would
disagree
with
that,
and
here's
why,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
goes
to
something
that
justice
sotomayor
asked,
which
is
it
creates
a
very
difficult
rule
to
deal
with.
the
petitioners
here,
one,
they
have
made
a
huge
concession,
we
believe,
in
their
reply
brief
by
saying
that
if
there's
an
illusory
remedy,
that
that
is
a
section
of
unconscionability
that
the
court
can
hear
and
must
hear.
but
all
these
other--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--the
--
the
reason
it's
a
concession
is
because
that's
not
their
original
position
and
that's
not
the
question
that
they
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
the
first
circuit,
your
honor,
we
believe
did
not
interpret
this
correctly.
they
have,
we
believe,
carved
out
a
section
of
unconscionability
law
at
the
exclusion
of
all
other
unconscionability
law.
we
know
that
states
and
federal
courts
have
routinely
applied
state
unconscionability
law,
and
they
would
have
a
rule
whereby
all
this
jurisprudence
of
the
states
delineating
unconscionability
law
would
in
essence
be
preempted.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
well,
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
and
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
correctly,
that
determination
must
of
course
be
made
by
the
court,
because
the
arbitrator
doesn't
have
any
authority
to
do
anything
until
the
requirements
of
section
2
are
met.
and
i
hope
i'm
understanding
your
honor's
question.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
that
--
in
essence,
yes.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
respectfully,
i
--
i
disagree
with
that,
and
here's
why,
your
honor:
the
back-end
review
--
presumably
it
would
be,
i
believe,
under
section
10(a)(4)
that
he
exceeded
his
authority.
and
once
the
arbitrator
is
empanelled
under
the
federal
--
under
section
2,
once
he
is
authorized
to
make
any
decisions
at
all,
including
the
issue
that
the
petitioner
would
have
him
decide
of
unconscionability
and
arbitrability,
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
to
say
he
has
exceeded
his
authority.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
i
think
the
concern
is,
your
honor,
and
it's
hard
to
draw
the
line--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--i
think
there's
no
adequate
review
if
he
chooses
to
without
the
court's
review
of--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--your
honor,
i
would
hope
they
would,
but
i
--
in
reading
the
narrow
review
of
section
9,
10,
and
11,
i
don't
think
we
have
that
guarantee.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
right.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
that
--
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
second
one.
that
there
are
issues--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--but
we
don't
concede
that,
your
honor.
that's
the
whole
point,
is
that
the
court
must
make
that
threshold
determination.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
because
that's
the
mandate
of
section
2.
the
arbitrator
derives
his
authority--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--your
honor,
the
parties
are
--
don't
necessarily
have
to
take
every
issue
to
court,
but
should
a
party
challenge
that
issue
as
unconscionable,
that
door
should
remain
open.
this
case
is
not
so
much
--
it
is
about
our
case
here,
but
there's
a
bigger
picture
here.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
--
that
the
threshold
determination
as
to
the
validity
of
the
contract--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--would
go
the
court.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
your
honor
is
describing
is
the
first
part
of
first
options
that
looked
--
and
that's
what
the
petitioner
would
like
to
rely
on,
is
objective
contract
language.
but
then
the
court
adds
the
entire
other
section
which
says
we
don't
presume
that
parties
intend
to
arbitrate
certain
matters
and
--
because
we're
not
yet
at
that
scope
--
but
we
want
clear
and
unmistakable
language,
not
just
objective
language
in
the
contract.
and
there's
an
important
reason
for
that,
because
it's
impossible
to
draw
the
line.
you're
carving
out
certain
issues
of
unconscionability--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--saying
both--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--they
--
i
think
the
answer
there
would
be
yes,
but
the
door
needs
to
be
open
in
case
there
is
a
challenge,
your
honor.
certainly,
nobody
is--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--required
to
go
to
court.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
i
think
if
your
honor
is
asking--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--again,
your
honor--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--well,
we
don't
concede
that
it
clearly
does
that.
we
--
what
our
position
is--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--i
don't
think
that
gets
us
around
the
requirements
of
section
2,
your
honor,
that
says
the
court
and
the
doors
to
the
court
must
always
remain
open
for
that.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
i
hope
i'm
understanding
your
question.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
that's
true,
your
honor,
the
--
but
the
logical
reading
of
that
statute
would
indicate
that
these
three
elements
--
a
writing,
in
interstate
commerce,
and
not
revocable
at
law
and
equity
--
would
have
to
be
met
before
the
arbitrator
has
any
authority
to
do
anything.
and
as
your
honor
mentioned
in
the
--
in
the
doctor's
associates
case,
there
are
certain
issues
that
are
certainly
involved,
and
unconscionability
is
one
of
those
issues
that
can
be
presented
to
the
court
without
violating
section
2,
as
well
as
fraud
and
duress,
i
believe,
were
the
other
ones
that
the
court
had
--
had
delineated
in
that
case.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
that's
because
it
was
well
argued.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
yes.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
well,
we
said
that
--
it
was
certainly
my
position
that
the
entire
agreement
was
unconscionable
based
on
nevada
law--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--and
that
it
was
so
incredibly
one-sided,
and
also
the
limited
discovery
provisions,
and
also
because,
frankly,
we
are
not
looking
to
treat
this
anything
other
than
like
we
would
ordinary
contract
law
that
also
strikes
one-sided
provisions
in
--
for
example,
in
nevada,
the
fick
case,
which
would
strike
down
a
one-sided
prenuptial
agreement,
or
lease
agreements
that
have
one-sided
attorney
fee
provisions
are
routinely
struck
down
as
one-sided.
so
their
position--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--i
think
this
court
has
made
clear
in
the
severability
cases
that
challenges
to
the
contract
as
a
whole
would
go
to
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
we
have
here,
as
petitioner
admits
to--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--so
the
stronger
one
would
be
an
--
as
this
case,
which
we
believe
is
very
strong,
an
attack--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--i
think
that's
what
sections
3
and
4
contemplate,
is
for
--
and
they
have
been
in
existence
since
the
passage
of
the
act
--
for
parties
to
come
in
and
make
their
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
faa
would
apply
or
not
apply.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
that's
not
the
situation
in
this
case,
but
assuming
it
were--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--i
understand.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
representing
my
client,
who
is
mr.
jackson,
i
would
want
the
court
to
look
at
the
whole
thing,
but
if
i
were
in
the
petitioner's
shoes
i
think
i
would
have
an
argument
that,
based
on
this
court's
precedent--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--if
it's
an
attack
on
the
contract
as
a
whole,
it
should
go
to
the
arbitrator.
i
think
that's
clear
from
many
of
the
court's
cases;
whereas,
if
the
attack
is
to
the
arbitration
clause
itself,
that
is
something
for
the
court
to
decide
and
determine--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--correct.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
correct.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
no,
your
honor.
respectfully,
it's
our
position
that
both
are
present.
there
are
certain
elements
of
the
arbitration
agreement
that
are
unconscionable
and,
under
nevada
law,
which
would
render
the
entire
arbitration
agreement
unconscionable.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
i'm
giving
you
the
one
i
just
gave
you,
i
think,
your
honor,
which
is
we've
got
both
certain
provisions
that
are
unconscionable,
that
under
nevada
law
render
the
entire
agreement
unconscionable--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--and
that's
what
the
court
is
to
rely
on.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
that
would
be
the
court
under
our
position,
your
honor,
and
that--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--well--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--your
honor,
that
is
our
position.
i
hope
i
am
understanding
your
question.
but
this
is
a
matter
of
state
law
as
to
which
provisions
would
render
the
entire
agreement
unconscionable.
and
i
think
that
body
of
unconscionability
law
is
not
so
varied
that
we
would
have
unwieldy
results.
i
think
state--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--right,
and
our--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--certainly,
they
do.
certainly,
they
do.
but
before
they
have
that
authority
to
even
do
that,
the
requirements,
again,
of
section
2
have
to
be
met.
and
that
is
our
position
in
this
matter.
that's--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--no,
your
honor,
and
here's
why:
i
think
your
honor
has
described
a
situation
similar
to
--
i
believe
that
was
the
green
tree
situation,
where
there
was
an
allegation
that
the
entire
contract
was
illegal,
the
usurious
contract.
but
there
was
no
question
as
to
the
making
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
so,
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
if
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
arbitration
agreement
being
subject
to
a
ground
of
revocation
at
law
or
at
equity
as
defined
in
section
2,
then
i
would
--
i
would
concede
that
that
was
something
that
would
go
to
the
arbitrator,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
well,
your
honor,
respectfully,
in
doctor's
associates,
i
think
the
court
spoke
very
clearly
that
fraud,
duress,
and
unconscionability
are
there
and
are
part
of
something
that
can
be
raised
under
section
2.
and
also
the
court's
hold
in
prima
paint--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--where
fraud--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--to
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
not
under
section
2,
your
honor.
i
think
the
--
the
definition
that
the
petitioner
would
have
this
court
adopt,
that
narrow
view
of
making
--
again,
something
justice
sotomayor
brought
up
--
would
create
a
rule
where
certain
unconscionability
challenges
went
to
the
court--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--and
other
unconscionability
challenges
didn't
go
to
the
court.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
all
of
them
should
go
to
the
court,
your
honor,
based
on
this
court's
holding
both
in
doctor's
associates
and
prima
paint,
in
that
both
fraud
in
the
inducement,
like
in
prima
paint,
and
unconscionability
envision
a
situation
where
you've
got
a
formed
contract
that
people
can
choose
to
opt
out
of.
i
may
be
subject
to
a
contract
that
was
induced
by
fraud,
but
i
may
like
the
benefit
of
that
bargain.
so
i
may
be
able
to
go
ahead
with
that.
and
same
with
an
unconscionability
challenge.
we've
got
an
agreement
that
was
made
that
--
that
the
innocent
party
can
decide
to
opt
out
of.
and
i
think
that's
very
consistent
with
this
court's
holding
and
with
what
the
various
state
courts
have
been
doing
in
reliance
on
those
holdings.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
my
understanding
is
that
it's
so
unfair
that
it
couldn't
really
be
said
that
a
party
assented
to
--
to
that.
and
i
think
that's
what--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--it's
the
latter,
your
honor.
i
think
if
they
really
chose
to--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--if
i
understand
your
question--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--i
--
i
think
that
the
safe
thing
to
do
is
to
keep
the
door
open
to
people,
especially
in
situations
like
this,
where
there
is
such
unequal
bargaining
power,
where
people
are
presented
with
a
nonnegotiable
term
of
their
employment--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
certainly.
and
i
think
that
would
be
matter
of
state
law,
again,
to
determine
when
there--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
in
nevada
you
would
--
if
we
had
maybe
just
one
unconscionable
clause,
that
the
court
might
sever
and
send
the
rest
to
the
--
and
validate
the
rest
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
but
then
when
--
certain
--
any
number
of
clauses,
depending
on
state
law,
would
make
the
entire
agreement
to
arbitrate
unconscionable.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
if
the
agreement
--
i
think
i
understand
your
question.
if
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
itself
is
not--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--there's
no
unconscionability
challenge
to
that,
and
there's
no
other
fraud
in
the
inducement
or
any
other
thing
that
the
court
has
mentioned
it
would
go
to
the
broader
view
of
making
the
grounds
for
revocation,
if
those
grounds
for
revocation
are
not
present,
then
i
believe
the
arbitrator
would
be
empowered
to
make
those
decisions,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
i
think
the
door
should
be
open
on
all
the
agreements,
because
until
that
door
is
open
under
section
2
--
as
long
as
that
door
is
open
under
section
2,
then
we
don't
have
the
concern
about
parties
making
the
terms
of
arbitration
so
onerous
or
burdensome
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
even
access
the
arbitral
forum.
and
that's
really
a
huge
concern
in
--
in
not
just
in
this
case,
but
in
the
bigger
picture.
courts
must
remain
open
to
protect
people.
i
would
venture
to
say
that
there
are
many
people
in
this
room
who
are
subject
to
arbitration
agreements,
and
they
don't
even
know,
through--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
they
all
are
subject
to
that.
and
then
we
look
to
state
law
to
determine,
whether,
for
example,
in
nevada
if
you've
got
great
procedural
unconscionability
they
have
the
sliding
scale
approach
based
on
the
d.r.
horton
case,
which
we
have
briefed,
where
you
would
require
less
of
a
showing
of
substantive
unconscionability--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
that
door's
been
open
under
section
3
and
4
since
the
inception
of
the
act.
we
are
advocating
the
status
quo
be
maintained
here,
your
honor,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suggest
that
there
will
be
some
rush
to
court
on
this.
courts
are
quite
capable
to
do
this
in
a
summary
fashion.
if
a
party
comes
before
the
court
with
a
baseless
unconscionability
challenge,
i
would
imagine
not
only
will
the
court
dispose
of
it
quickly,
but
if
an
attorney
makes
a
routine
practice
of
bringing
baseless
motions
to
the
court,
he'll
have
his
own
issues
to
deal
with.
so,
i
don't
--
i
--
i
disagree
that
there
will
be
some
floodgates
or
that
this
will
in
any
way
--
to
the
contrary--
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
--we
disagree
with
them
and
your
honor,
and
i
would
cite
that
we
have
some
of
the
most
prestigious
arbitrators
in
this
country
that
have
joined
our
position
and
recognized
the
courts'
vital
role
in
maintaining
the
fairness
of
the
arbitration
process
so
the
public
can
trust
it
and
so
the
weaker
parties
to
these
agreements
can
be
protected,
because
should
that
disappear,
there
will
be
nothing
to
stop
stronger
parties
from
again
sending
mr.
jackson,
who
lives
in
reno,
to
minnesota
to
arbitrate
his
claim.
mr.
ian
e.
silverberg
there
--
there
is
something
unusual.
they've
gone
well
beyond
the
aaa
and
limited
discovery
to
one
deposition
and
one
expert,
which
in
an
employment
case
is
very
difficult.
thank
you,
your
honor.
