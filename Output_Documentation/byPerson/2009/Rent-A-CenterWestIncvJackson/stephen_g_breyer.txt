justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
--
that's
true.
the
thing
i
was
wondering
in
this
case
is
there's
a
--
a
dispute
that's
about
racial
discrimination
and
so
forth.
there's
a
clause,
and
the
clause
says
this
is
arbitrable,
but
that
is
being
disputed
because
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
says
that's
an
unconscionable
provision,
so
it
doesn't
really
apply.
and
then
you
say
but
now
that
dispute
is
referred
to
the
arbitrator
to
just
read
the
language.
but
the
plaintiff
says
that
that
language,
too,
is
unconscionable,
and
as
long
as
that
language
is
unconscionable,
then
how
is
it
clear
and
unmistakable
that
they,
he,
agreed
to
do
it,
because
an
unconscionable
provision
is
not
a
provision?
so
if
we
apply
first
options
--
i
mean,
it's
complicated
because
of
the
language;
it's
not
complicated
once
you
think
it
out,
and
--
i
hope.
but
just
applying
it
very
literally,
it
would
seem
to
say
that
you
do
not
have
clear
and
unmistakable
evidence
that
they
agreed
to
submit
this
kind
of
dispute
to
arbitration
for
the
reason
that
what
you
point
to
is
itself
according
to
them
a
product
of
unconscionability.
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
making
itself
could
be,
but
i
think
that's
a
harder
question,
whether
a
--
certainly
if
the
person
says
you
see
my
signature
there;
that's
not
mine;
that's
joe
banana's,
who
tries
to
imitate
me
--
there
is
no
contract,
and
no
matter
what
it
says,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
arbitrator.
all
right?
now,
we
can
argue
about
whether
it
is
or
is
not
analogous
to
that
when
he
claims
it's
unconscionable.
there's
a
very
good
argument
it
is
analogous.
there's
a
very
good
argument
it
is
like
fraud
in
the
inducement,
and
there
are
some
arguments
the
other
way.
but
first
options
i
think
cuts
through
that,
by
saying
whether
that's
true
or
not,
unless
it's
clear
and
unmistakable
that
they
wanted
this
matter,
the
matter
of
whether
the
arbitration
clause
itself
is
unconscionable
referred
to
the
arbitrator,
whether
or
not
they
wanted
that
referred
to
the
arbitrator
has
to
be
clear
and
unmistakable.
and
they
are
claiming
no,
because
the
lack
--
the
provision
that
says
that
is
itself
a
product
of
unconscionability.
that's
to
repeat
my
question.
but,
having
repeated
the
question,
why
isn't
that
the
simplest,
most
direct,
and
four-sentence
ground
for
deciding
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
not
saying
that
this
whole
arbitration
clause
is
unconscionable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
so
he's
--
he's
complaining
the
whole
clause
is
unconscionable,
and
that's
part
of
the
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
in
first
options,
we
said
it
wasn't
clear
and
unmistakable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
rules
were
what
i
just
described.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
let's
go
back
to
that.
maybe
the
other
way
is
simpler.
you
say
you
agree
that
if
my
defense
to
this
contract,
which
you
are
trying
to
enforce
against
me
or
which
gives
me
a
right
to
sue
you,
look
at
the
argument,
you
put
up
this
four-page
document,
and
i
say:
look,
that
is
not
my
signature;
that
is
the
signature
of
joe
bananas.
we
agree
that's
for
the
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
we
agree
it's
for
the
court
if
my
defense
is,
what
he
did
is
he
got
me
drunk,
told
me
a
bunch
of
lies,
and
i
signed
it.
i
grant
it's
my
signature,
but
look
at
how
squiggly
it
is.
and
my
will
was
not
a
free
one
because
i
was
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
lies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
same.
that's
prima
paint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay?
now,
he
says
the
reason
that
i
did
not
sign
this
contract
--
i
agree
it's
my
signature;
i
agree
it
is
not
squiggly
--
but
still
my
will
was
overborne.
what
was
it
overborne
by?
it
was
overborne
by
those
very
situations
that
lead
courts
to
label
contracts
unconscionable.
the
reason
we
don't
enforce
unconscionable
contract
is
because
the
person
who
was
the
victim
had
no
free
will.
he
did
not
sign
it
of
his
own
accord.
and
that
doesn't
--
there's
no
other
reason,
and
that's
the
basic
reason,
and
therefore
assimilate
it
to
the
other
two.
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's
what
i
want
the
answer
to.
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
it.
what
i
want
is
a
list
of
reasons
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
not
interested
in
arbitration
law.
i'm
interested
in
contract
law,
and
i
want
to
know
why
as
a
general
matter
of
contract
law
an
allegation
of
unconscionability,
defense
of
unconscionability,
is
why
is
it
not
enough
like
the
coercion
defense
or
the
inducement
defense
or
the
"i
was
in
alaska"
defense?
isn't
it
enough
like
that
that
they
should
be
treated
alike?
and
now
you're
going
to
say
no,
and
i
want
to
know
why
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
--
what
i'm
not
sure
about
what
you
are
arguing
now
is
my
--
as
i
came
into
this,
i
thought
there
were
three
situations.
situation
1
is
common
in
labor
arbitration.
it's
an
arbitration
agreement
that
says
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
disputes
will
be
arbitrated,
and
we
have
a
question
about
whether
a
particular
dispute
is
or
is
not
full
within
the
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
to
that
one,
we
assume
that
the
parties
intended
the
question
of
arbitrability
to
be
arbitrated;
we
assume
it.
normally,
that's
the
rule.
it's
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
that's
a
little
hard
to
distinguish,
but
sometimes
that's
not
the
argument.
the
argument
could
be:
well,
there
are
four
different
provisions
in
the
arbitration
section,
and
we
think
one
of
them
is
void
because
it's,
say,
unconscionable,
but
the
others
are
okay.
now,
that
one,
i
mean,
normally,
you
could
if
it's
clear
enough
say
i
want
that
one
to
go
to
arbitration.
and
the
third
one
is
that
you
have
a
contract,
and
it's
an
arbitration
contract,
and
it's
on
four
separate
pieces
of
paper,
and
what
you're
saying
is,
i
was
in
alaska,
or
the
equivalent,
and
maybe
unconscionability
is
the
equivalent.
on
that
one
i'm
with
you.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
submit
--
agree
to
submit
that
to
the
arbitrator,
because
there's
no
agreement,
or
at
least
no
valid
one,
at
least
no
valid
one
under
state
law.
but
what
are
you
arguing?
that
this
is
that
case
or
this
is
the
other
case
i
just
mentioned,
that
middle
case
where
you
have
10
provisions
and
you're
saying
that
this
one
over
here
is
unconscionable
but
that
one
isn't;
and
--
but
i
did
sign
a
valid
arbitration
agreement.
i
agree
with
that.
it's
just
that
certain
provisions
of
it
are
invalid
because
they're
unfair.
what
are
you
arguing
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
second
one
--
i
don't
see
how
you
get
there,
because
if
it's
the
second,
one
you
concede
that
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement
that's
valid.
and
if
you
concede
that
there
is
a
valid
arbitration
agreement
between
you
and
your
client,
and
you're
arguing
over
the
scope
of
different
provisions
or
whether
certain
provisions
within
it
are
valid
or
invalid,
why
can't
you
submit
that
to
an
arbitrator
if
it's
clear
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
to
each
provision?
as
to
each
bit
of
--
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
you
and
your
--
your
client
--
rather,
your
client
and
the
other
side
have
absolutely
agreed,
clear
as
could
be,
under
the
arbitration
agreement:
we
want
arbitrated
too
whether
the
provision
that
these
words
are
contained
in
is
unconscionable.
can't
they
agree
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
let
me
say
it
more
easily.
we
have
agreement
number
one,
four
pages,
and
within
it
is
a
question
of
--
which
just
looks
like
this
one.
agreement
number
two:
the
two
parties
agree
that
if
any
dispute
should
arise
as
to
whether
any
words
in
agreement
number
one
are
unconscionable,
they
will
go
to
the
arbitrator.
agreement
number
two
is
concededly
valid.
now
do
you
want
to
say
that
agreement
number
one
--
those
words
have
to
be
decided
by
the
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
but
if
you're
going
to
say
yes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
i
think
if
you're
going
to
say
yes
to
that,
then
it's
contrary
to
first
options,
i
think.
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
don't
see
why
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
read
your
--
i
promise
you
i'll
go
back
to
first
options,
which
i
thought
was
of
gem-like
clarity--
[laughter]
and
i
am
apparently
the
only
one
in
the
world--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
only
one
in
the
world
who
thinks
that.
and
i'll
go
back
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'll
go
back
to
that
and
look
at
it.
but
the
--
the--
[laughter]
looking
at
your
response
to
their
motion
to
arbitrate--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
seemed
to
me
you
said
here
that
--
that
because
of
your
--
your
position,
your
client's
position,
that
the
whole
thing
is
unconscionable.
you
didn't
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
every
contract.
i
mean,
i'll
take
that
argument.
i'd
like
to
know
about
that
argument.
i'd
like
to
know
what
really
is
the
underlying,
which
i've
never
looked
up.
what
is
the
underlying
rationale
in
contract
law
of
setting
aside
contracts
as
unconscionable?
why
do
courts
do
it?
what's
the
theory?
i'd
like
to
know
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that's
what
i
wonder,
that
last
part
--
is
it
that
the
basic
theory
is
we
want
to
protect
a
group
of
people
by
--
who
voluntarily
entered
into
contracts
by
giving
them
the
right
to
opt
out,
or
is
is
that
we
don't
think
that
they
really
meant
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
on
that
question,
or
any
other
question,
is,
i
would
imagine,
where
we
have
agreement
one,
and
the
argument
is
maybe
agreement
one
was
unconscionable.
and
then
we
enter
into
agreement
two,
and
the
parties
in
agreement
two
agree
to
--
to
arbitrate
their
unconscionability
dispute
in
agreement
one,
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
agreement
two,
i
would
think
that's
then
the
question
of
unconscionability
is
for
the
arbitrator.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
"all",
and
i
just
don't
think
you
meant
all.
but
maybe
you
did.
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
is
the
one-sentence
answer,
one
sentence,
to
the
thing,
this
is
a
very
interesting
case,
lots
of
stuff
in
it
that
we
needn't
reach
because
irrespective
of
everything
else,
they
in
their
reply,
the
district
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
all
said
these
whole
four
pages,
the
whole
four
pages
were
unconscionable,
so
none
of
it's
enforceable,
and
all
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
that's
an
issue
for
the
court.
and
the
answer
to
that
being
not
an
issue
for
the
court
is
what,
in
a
sentence
or
two?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
said,
look,
there's
a
four-page
document.
they
said
this
four-page
document
is
unconscionable,
the
product
of
unconscionability,
and,
therefore,
don't
enforce
it.
that's
their
claim.
that
issue
is
at
least
is
for
the
court,
because
there
is
no
valid
agreement
here
at
all,
if
that's
right.
