mr.
robert
f.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
agreement
between
antonio
jackson
and
rent-a-center
should
be
enforced
as
written.
there
is
no
statutory
impediment
to
the
enforcement
of
the
clear
and
unmistakable
agreement
that
gives
the
arbitrator
exclusive
authority
to
decide
jackson's
challenge
to
enforceability,
nor
is
there
any
language
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
would
prohibit
the
court
from
making
the
determination
--
prohibit
the
arbitrator
from
making
the
determination
of
jackson's
challenge
to
unconscionability.
through
frequent
holdings
of
this
court
going
back
50
years
to
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
this
court
has
plainly
recognized
that
parties
may
delegate
issues
as
to
scope
and
validity
to
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance.
the
district
court
and--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
which
parties
can
be
potentially
scope
issues
and
which
parties
potentially
as
well.
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
enforceability.
and
through
the
holdings
of
first
options,
howsam,
and
bazzle,
going
back
to
previous
decisions,
this
court
has
held
that
parties
through
clear
and
unmistakable
delegation
can
give
that
to
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
justice
ginsburg,
fraud
in
the
inducement,
pursuant
to
prima
paint,
goes
to
the
making
of
the
agreement,
and
under
section
4,
the
court
retains
decisions
over
the
making
of
the
agreement.
unconscionability
is
a
post-formation
attack.
it
does
not
go
to
the
very
limited
inquiry
that
is
anticipated
under
section
4,
of
the
making--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--in
some
instances,
justice
kennedy,
duress
could
be;
for
example,
a
gun
to
somebody's
head.
but
procedural
unconscionability
does
not
go
to
the
same
issues
of
making.
and,
in
fact,
under
nevada
law
and
this
state's
laws--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--formation
is
a
very
basic
existential
analysis.
it
goes
to
mutual
assent.
did
the
parties
sign
the
agreement
and
indicate
the
desire
to
be
bound
by
the
agreement?
though--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
scalia,
you
could
make
that
argument--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--there
was
an
argument
made
that
it
was
one-sided,
but
it
was
the
same
type
of
argument
that
pertains--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--no,
justice
scalia.
that
argument
was
not--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--getting
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
making--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
stevens,
the
argument
was
that
there
was
unequal
bargaining
power
because
mr.
jackson
was
the
--
a
putative
employee
and
rent-a-center
was
the
employer.
he
also
complained
about
a
couple
of
the
provisions
in
the
agreement,
one
pertaining
to
discovery,
one
pertaining
to
an
alleged
fee-splitting
provision
in
the
agreement.
he
did
not
complain
as
to
the
terms
that
justice
scalia
just
referred
to.
with
respect
to
making,
it
is
a
very
limited
inquiry,
and
section
4
is
the
provision
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
gives
a
court
the
power
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement.
once
the
court
is
satisfied
that
the
making
is
not
an
issue
and
the
making
is
a
very
basic
issue,
the
court,
pursuant
to
the
plain
language
of
section
4,
must
submit
the
dispute
to
arbitration.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
now,
in
some
instances,
the
courts
will
make
decisions
as
to
attacks
such
as
unconscionability.
but
in
this
sense--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--that's
--
that's
right,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
well,
justice
sotomayor,
unconscionability
and
fairness
attacks
go
to
post-formation
issues
that
--
that
are--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--but,
justice
sotomayor,
if
for
example
it's
fraud
in
the
inducement,
such
as
in
prima
paint,
that
does
go
to
the
section
4.
it
does
go
to
the
making
of
the
agreement
because
there
would
not
be
mutual
assent
if
somebody
was
forced
to
enter
into
the
agreement.
in
contrast,
unconscionability,
and
certainly
the
allegations
we've
seen
here
against
the
agreement,
go
to
post-formation
complaints,
complaints
about
the
fairness
of
the
agreement.
they
do
not
go
to
the
actual,
very
limited
making
of
the
agreement.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
well--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--if
--
if
there
is
something
in
the
agreement
that
would
indicate
that
there
was
not
mutual
assent,
as
in
somebody
put
a
gun
to
somebody's
head,
somebody
forced
them
to
do
it,
that
would
be
for
the
court.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
attacks
on
the
fairness
and
simply
pointing
to
provisions
and
saying,
well,
these
are
very
unfair;
it
must
be
an
indication
of
it
being
forced
--
no,
that
would
be
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide,
because
it's
simply
an
attack
on
the
fairness
and
there's
speculation
as
to
why
somebody
entered.
and
in
this
agreement--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
scalia,
under
the
section
4
analysis,
in
the
making
there
needs
to
be
some
evidence
that
it
was
forced,
the
gun
to
the
head
example.
simply
pointing
to
the
language
in
the
agreement
as
evidence
of
that
would
not
be
enough.
that
is
an
attack
on
the
language
of
the
agreement
after
it's
been
formed.
the
section
4
analysis
is
very,
very
limited,
and
it
goes
to
these
most
basic
elements.
so
the
language
of
the
agreement,
while
certainly
the
party
opposing
it
will
have
the
opportunity
to
make
the
argument
it's
unconscionable,
but
that
would
be
for
the
arbitrator--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--it
certainly
would
not
in
and
of
itself
be
enough--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--your
honor,
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
objective
manifestation
of
mutual
assent.
for
example,
in
this
agreement--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
to
what
transpired
at
the
time
the
agreement
was
actually
entered
into
and
was
made.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
justice
stevens,
if
there
is
an
issue
about
arbitral
access,
as
in
there
is
a
block
at
the
door,
you
cannot
get
a
ticket
to
the
show,
because
of
some
impediment
in
getting
to
arbitration
in
the
first
place,
under
the
court's
principles
announced
in
randolph
and
in
first
options,
you
must
have
access
to
the
arbitrator.
so
in
your
example,
if
there
is
something
prohibiting
access
to
the
arbitrator,
that
would
be
a
different
story.
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
ginsburg,
if
it's
simply
a
complaint
about
the
fairness,
it
would
not
be.
if
the
parties--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--it
could,
justice
ginsburg.
it
would
not
be
a
question
of
arbitrability
if
the
party
opposing
arbitration
can
meet
the
very
heavy
burden
established
in
randolph
to
show
that
the
fees
would
be
--
would
prohibit
them
from
actually
getting
to
arbitration.
it
would
not
be
simply
an
attack
as
we
saw
here,
with
no
evidence,
that
we
think
a
term
is
unfair.
the
party
opposing
arbitration
would
have
to
meet
their
burden.
they
would
have
to
put
evidence
in.
and,
for
example,
in
randolph
the
court
stated
that
in
certain
instances
mrs.
randolph
could
have
put
evidence
in,
and
had
she
put
evidence
in,
which
she
did
not,
much
as
in
this
case,
if
she
had
met
her
burden
to
show
that
she
could
not
have
access
to
arbitration
--
in
other
words,
if
arbitration
is
an
illusory
remedy
--
that
could
be
for
the
court
to
decide,
because,
after
all,
even
in
the
first
options
decision,
the
anticipation
is
you
have
a
clear
and
unmistakably
delegation
that
the
arbitrator
will
make
a
decision,
and
implicit
in
that
that
there
is
an
arbitrator
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
justice
breyer,
under
section
4,
which
is
the
enforcement
mechanism,
the
court
is
limited
to
make
decisions
about
the
making.
once
the
making
issue
is
not
an
issue
--
and
it
has
never
been
an
issue
in
this
case;
there
has
never
been
an
allegation
the
making
has
been
affected
--
the
court
at
that
point
should
enforce
the
agreement
pursuant
to
its
terms.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
justice
breyer,
jackson,
first
and
foremost,
did
not
ever
complain
that
the
arbitrability
provision,
the
clear
and
unmistakable
delegation
provision,
is
unconscionable.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
he's
complaining
that
generally
it's
unconscionable--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
breyer,
this
is
really
very
similar
to
first
options,
in
which
the
party
said:
i'm
not
party
to
the
agreement;
the
scope
does
not
cover--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--the
court
said
it
was
not,
but
in
first
options
the
court
set
out
the
rule--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--the
rule
is
--
in
this
case,
there
is
language
that
has
never
been
contested,
and
that
language
clearly
and
unmistakably
says
that
the
arbitrator
has
exclusive
authority.
that
language
has
never
been
attacked.
and
as
to
the
issue
of
unconscionability,
pursuant
to
section
4,
which
gives
the
court
the
authority
to
send
the
arbitration
to
the
arbitrator,
the
court
should
do
exactly
that.
it
should
send
it
to
the
arbitrator
once
the
making
issue
is
satisfied,
and
then
the
arbitrator
can
make
that
decision.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
in
some
instances,
justice
roberts
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
the
court
must
decide
whether
the
agreement
is
made.
the
court
must
also
decide
whether
there
was
a
clear
and
unmistakable
delegation.
so
under
first
options
and
the
cases
that
interpret
it
and
the
cases
before
it,
the
court
must
make
the
initial
determination
of
whether
there
is
a
clear
and
unmistakable
delegation.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
he
has
made
generalized--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
kennedy,
he
has
attacked
certain
provisions
specifically
of
the
agreement.
he
is
arguing
about
the
discovery
provision.
he
is
arguing
about
the
fees
provision.
and
he
is
arguing
about
certain
terms
excluding
claims,
that
bilaterally
exclude
claims.
so
he
has
attacked
about
three
provisions
of
the
agreement
specifically.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
a
stand-alone
four-page
arbitration
agreement.
and--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--we
agree,
justice
breyer.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
we
agree--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--because
that's
part
of
the
fraud
issue.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
no,
justice
breyer,
that
would
be
a
very
different
situation.
that
would
be
allegations
of
procedural
unconscionability,
unequal
bargaining
power,
and
in
fact--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--no,
there
could
be
other
types
of
unconscionability.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
with
respect
to
procedural
unconscionability,
issues
of
unequal
economic
bargaining
power,
which
is
essentially
what
we
have
here
--
those
are
non-issues
that
cannot
be
addressed
by
the
arbitrator.
and,
in
fact,
under
nevada
law,
justice
breyer,
an
allegation
of
procedural
unconscionability,
no
matter
how
procedural--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--it
does
not
rise
to
the
same
level
as
something
that's
fraudulent
or
something
that
is
forced
with
a
gun
to
your
head--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--mr.
chief
justice,
most
everything
is
for
the
arbitrator,
and
i
want
to
distinguish
between
unconscionability,
as
justice
breyer
is
referring
to,
and
access
issues
and
issues
that
go
to
the
making,
because
there
is
a
very
bright
line.
making
issues
go
to
the
actual
formation,
mutual
assent,
and
there
is
obviously
no
mutual
assent
if
you
have
a
gun
to
your
head.
but
issues
such
as,
well,
this
is
unfair,
i
may
have
to
do
this,
speculation
is
simply
not
enough
to
--
to
pertain
to
the
making
of
the
agreement,
nor
is
an
issue
about
an
impossibly
burdensome
access
to
the
arbitration.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
justice
ginsburg,
there
will
be
court
review
at
the
end
pursuant
to
section
10.
as
a
result
of
hall
street,
section
10
is
now
the
exclusive
basis
on
the
tail
end--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but
by
operation
of
law
and
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
hall
street,
now
the
parties
will
receive
the
section
10
review,
much
as
they
would
in
the
first
options
case.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
justice
scalia,
that's
absolutely
correct.
there
has
been
no
argument,
in
fact,
at
no
time
--
and
it
would
have
--
the
proper
place
would
have
been
the
district
court
--
was
any
evidence
ever
put
into
the
record--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--but,
justice
ginsburg,
at
the
district
court
no
evidence
of
any
sort
attacking
any
provision.
the
only
attacks
here
on
the
provisions
are
the
arguments
that
were
made
by
my
colleague
in
the
brief--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
ginsburg,
my
point
simply
is
they
put
in
no
evidence
of
any
sort
attacking
anything.
we're
simply--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--i
--
i--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--justice
scalia,
they
could
make
that
argument
before
the
arbitrator,
and
the
arbitrator
could
make
that
decision.
under
the
clear
and
unmistakable
delegation,
that
issue,
like
other
issues,
should
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
nobody
is
contesting
--
at
least
certainly
nobody
contested
prior
to
us
getting
to
the
supreme
court
--
both
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
language
was
clear
and
unmistakable.
there
was
never
any
contest
to
that
issue
until
we
got
here.
and
because
of
the
clear
and
unmistakable
language
and
because
the
agreement
does
not
implicate
the
making,
we
asked
the
court
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
agreement
as
written
and
pursuant
to
bazzle
and
howsam.
in
particular,
in
bazzle
the
court
recognized
that
issues
as
to
scope
and
issues
as
to
validity
can
go
to
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance.
here,
there
can
be
no
doubt
--
and
certainly
there
was
no
doubt
at
the
district
court
level
and
ninth
circuit
--
that
the
parties
clearly
and
unmistakably
gave
the
arbitrator
exclusive
authority.
and
we're
asking
the
court
to
give
effect
to
that
language.
the
--
the
--
the
primary
purpose
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
to
enforce
arbitration
agreements
pursuant
to
their
terms.
here,
there's
no
real
dispute
about
what
the
terms
are.
under
section
4,
a
limited
inquiry,
once
we
have
satisfied
section
4
the
court
should
proceed
to
send
us
to
the
arbitrator.
nobody
is
arguing
that
mr.
jackson
can't
make
these
challenges
once
he
gets
to
arbitration.
in
fact,
he
certainly
can.
and
the
arbitrator
will
make
that
decision.
and
the
arbitrator
may
decide
that
it
is
unconscionable,
in
which
case
he'll
set
it
down.
or
he
may
decide
--
or
he
or
she
may
decide
that
it's
not
unconscionable,
or
he
or
she
may
decide
that
certain
terms
are
problematic
and
to
sever
those.
at
this
point,
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
my
time.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
hearing
terms
like
"safe
thing
to
do".
and
in
response
to
--
i
think
it
was
a
question
from
justice
scalia,
i'm
hearing
my
colleague
state
that
there
is
concern
that
the
arbitrator
is
not
going
to
apply
state
law.
this
is
merely
distrust
of
arbitrators.
this
court
has
rejected
this
bias
that
arbitrators
cannot
make
these
decisions.
and,
in
fact,
this
court
and
many
others
have
sent
very,
very
complicated
issues
to
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
an
arbitrator,
as
well
as
a
judge,
cannot
decide
state
law
issues
of
unconscionability,
and
the
arbitrator
will
have
the
discretion
and
the
ability
to
either
strike
the
entire
arbitration
agreement
or
strike
certain
clauses
as
he
or
she
sees
fit.
furthermore,
this
type
of
speculation,
this
fear
as
to
what
the
arbitrator
may
do,
that
was
rejected
in
this
court's
decisions
in
vimar
and
pacificare,
where
the
court
stated
we
are
going
to
enforce
this,
and
the
arbitrator
may
do
something
wrong,
may
do
something
right,
but
at
the
tail
end
there
will
be
an
ability
under
section
10
to
address
it.
there
is
no
difference
there.
additionally,
this
--
this
analysis
of
unconscionability
--
i
want
to
reiterate
unconscionability
is
based
on
a
policy
decision
that
--
that
attacks
an
agreement
that
unquestionably
has
already
been
made.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
justice
breyer,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
going
to
ask
you
to--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--no,
justice
breyer,
the
determination
of
unconscionability
is
for
the
arbitrator.
the
--
the
limited
role
of
the
court
goes
only
to
the
making,
not
to
the
issue
of
unconscionability.
so
the
court--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--no,
justice
sotomayor,
our
argument
about
the
onerous
fee
--
and
it
would
have
to
be
evidence
put
in
by
the
party
opposing
counsel
--
by
the
party
opposing
arbitration,
that
there
was
an
actual
barrier,
an
impossibly
burdensome
barrier.
so
it
does
not
come
under
making;
it
would
be
under
a
--
a
randolph
standard
or
under
a
first
options
standard.
there's
two
areas
that
we
agree
are
for
the
court.
one
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
an
issue
with
the
making
of
the
agreement.
the
other
one,
if
it's
challenged,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
indeed
access
to
arbitration.
the
first
circuit
in
awuah
applied
this
test
very
neatly
in
a
very
reasonable
manner
and
applied
both
first
options
and
randolph,
harmonized
those
cases,
and
made
a
determination
that
unconscionability
is
for
the
arbitrator
based
on
a
clear
and
unmistakable
delegation.
but
issues
as
to
whether
or
not--
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
--exactly,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
f.
friedman
exactly,
justice
scalia.
it
fails
the
first
options
test.
there
can't
be
an
ability
under
first
options
for
the
arbitrator
to
make
a
decision
if
there's
no
access
to
the
arbitrator.
so
those
are
the
two
tests.
in
--
in
this
case,
what
i
think
i'm
hearing
is
my
colleague
is
saying
that
the
arbitrator
can
decide
nothing;
the
arbitrator
should
decide
nothing,
notwithstanding
this
court's
regular
holdings
sending
very,
very
complicated
matters
to
the
arbitrator.
in
this
case,
the
arbitrator
can
absolutely
decide
these
issues
of
unconscionability
as
well
as
a
judge
can.
thank
you.
