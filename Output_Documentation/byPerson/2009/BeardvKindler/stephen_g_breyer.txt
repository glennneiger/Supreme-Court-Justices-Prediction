justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
are
going
to
say,
i
imagine
below
--
i'm
not
sure
--
say:
look,
that's
right,
and
doctor
talked
about
the
shift
from
mandatory
to
discretionary,
and
the
district
court
--
the
state,
in
doctor,
said
that
it
was
a
mandatory
--
it's
mandatory.
but
in
this
case,
the
district
court
said
it's
discretionary.
so
insofar
as
there
are
two
rules
--
or
were
at
the
time,
your
client
got
the
benefit
of
the
most
liberal,
and,
therefore,
insofar
as
there
is
a
difference,
it
made
no
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
you
fill
in
this
sentence?
i'm
beginning
where
the
chief
justice
did.
say
everybody
said:
look,
this
opinion
is
at
least
unclear.
it's
--
everybody
agrees
that
the
simple
existence
of
discretion
does
not
make
a
state
ground
inadequate,
so
we
send
it
back
for
you
now.
and
you
will
have
some
good
arguments,
i
guarantee
each
side
will
have
some
good
arguments,
as
to
whether
they
were
being
consistent
or
not,
whether
there
was
a
consistent
rule
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
next
sentence,
which
maybe
would
never
be
written:
this
is
not
to
say
that
discretion
automatically
means
it's
adequate,
for
it
could
be
applied
inconsistently.
now,
there
could
be
another
sentence,
because
that
other
sentence
would
have
to
go
on
to
the
fact
that
any
discretionary
rule
will
never
be
applied
with
perfect
consistency
or
anywhere
near
it.
that
would
be
true
if
you
give
a
trial
judge
the
choice
in
his
discretion
to
waive
a
--
a
time
limit
ruling.
some
will
do
it
with
one.
some
will
do
it
in
the
other.
you
can't
do
it
perfectly.
so
is
there
any
sentence
we
could
put
in
there?
so
you
hedged
on
there,
and
probably
they
will,
too,
because
it's
very
hard
to
find
the
right
sentence.
you
don't
want
the
simple
application
of
discretion,
you
say
--
which
inevitably
means
some
inconsistency,
to
make
a
state
rule
inadequate.
on
the
other
hand,
they
can't
go
too
far.
so
what
is
too
far?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
but,
but,
but,
but,
a
trial
supreme
court
--
a
supreme
court
in
a
state
is
supervising
lots
of
trial
courts,
and
you
will
have
different
human
beings
sitting
there
as
judges,
and
they
will
inevitably
be
inconsistent
with
each
other
to
some
degree.
have
you
not
noticed
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
there
anything
we
can
say
that
will
improve
the
situation?
that's
why
i
started
out
by
saying
maybe
the
best
thing
is
to
say
nothing.
