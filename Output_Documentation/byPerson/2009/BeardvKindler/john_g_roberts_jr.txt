chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
08-992,
beard
v.
kindler.
mr.
eisenberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lawry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
because
he
escaped.
he
avoided
judicial
process,
and
you
would
have
him
be
in
the
same
position
once
he's
captured
and
returned
and
captured
and
returned
as
he
was
before
he
escaped
at
all,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
think
that
--
and
you
don't
think
--
you
think
you
can
argue
that
a
state
rule
saying,
look,
if
you
escape
and
flee
the
jurisdiction,
you
bar
--
your
claims
cannot
be
adequate
and
independent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
following
up
on
that,
i'd
like
your
answer
to
this
question:
is
a
state
procedural
rule
automatically
inadequate
and,
therefore,
unenforceable
when
the
state
rule
is
discretionary
rather
than
mandatory?
automatically?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
agree--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
you
agree
with
the
petitioner's
response
to
that
question?
their
point
--
their
question
presented
is,
is
it
automatically
inadequate
because
there
is
discretion?
they
say
no,
you
say
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
was
the
same
--
that
was
the
position
you
took
in
your
opposition
to
certiorari.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
yet
we
nonetheless
granted
--
granted
cert.--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
if
some
of
us
--
or
i
suppose
if
several
of
us
--
think
that
that
may
have
been
or
was
what
the
third
circuit
said,
would
you
have
any
objection
to
us
vacating
the
opinion,
explaining
since
you
both
agree
that
the
rule
is
not
automatically
inadequate,
make
sure
they
understand
that,
and
then
they
can
proceed
however
they
see
fit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
that
is
--
your
objection
is
that
it
wasn't
fairly
applied.
discretion
was
abused
in
this
case,
to
borrow
from
the
federal
law.
they
didn't
treat
them
the
same.
they
should
have
treated
them
the
same.
but
the
question
is
whether
the
rule
is
automatically
inadequate
if
there
is
discretion.
you
are
arguing
about
how
it
was
applied,
which
i
guess
means
that
it's
not
automatically
inadequate
because
if
they
apply
it
the
way
you
think
it
should
be
then
it
would
be
adequate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
i
did,
too.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
point
is
you
are
arguing
about
the
application
--
the
exercise
of
discretion.
you
say
the
one
guy,
lewis,
got
the
benefit
of
the
rule;
your
guy
didn't
get
the
benefit
of
the
rule;
and
that's
unfair,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
not
arguing
--
which
would
be
very
odd
to
argue
--
that
the
discretion
always
makes
the
rule
invalid
because
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
problem
--
justice
stevens'
question
brought
this
up.
i
mean,
how
do
you
address
that
question
if
you
don't
have
very
many
applications
of
the
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
say
it's
the
first
one
that
comes
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
reasoned
explanation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
don't
doubt
that
it
would
be
an
independent
and
adequate
state
rule
to
say
whenever
anybody
escapes
they
waive
their
claims?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
what
is
the
federal
fugitive
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
has
discretion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
discretion
that
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
here
--
is
that
similar?
can
the
pennsylvania
supreme
courts
exercise
that
discretion
in
a
calibrated
way,
not
all
or
nothing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
got
the
windfall
of
being
free
for
eight
years,
right?
i
guess
that
gets
back
to
the
point
of
your
friend,
which
is
he
is
in
no
worse
position
because
he
escaped
and
spent
eight
years
on
the
lam
than
if
he
had
stayed
in
prison.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
obviously
if
the
state
prevails
he's
in
a
worse
position.
but
under
your
view,
he's
in
this
--
he's
in
no
worse
position.
he
hasn't
waived
all
his
objections
and
claims,
procedures.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry,
if
i
could
just
nail
down
the
point.
as
far
as
his
rights
and
proceedings
in
this
case,
he
is
in
no
worse
position
under
your
theory
having
escaped
and
been
out
for
eight
years
than
if
he
had
stayed
put?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
eisenberg,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
in
case
08-992
beard
vs.
kindler.
joseph
kindler
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
in
pennsylvania
state
court
and
the
jury
recommended
a
death
sentence.
kindler
filed
post
verdict
motions
challenging
his
conviction
and
sentence,
but
before
the
trial
court
could
consider
the
motions,
kindler
escaped
from
the
maximum
security
wing
of
the
prison
where
he
was
being
held
and
fled
north
to
canada.
the
state
trial
court
dismissed
kindler’s
post
verdict
motions
because
of
his
escape.
canadian
authorities
eventually
arrested
kindler
for
burglary
in
québec
and
discovered
that
he
was
wanted
in
the
united
states,
but
before
he
could
be
extradited,
kindler
escaped
again.
this
time
kindler
broke
through
a
skylight
on
the
13th
floor
of
the
jail
and
using
bed
sheets
tied
together,
successfully
repelled
down
the
side
of
the
jail.
a
fellow
escapee
was
not
as
lucky,
the
sheets
ripped
on
his
way
down
causing
him
to
plummet
50
feet
to
his
death.
kindler
remained
on
the
lame
for
more
than
two
years
until
he
was
featured
on
the
television
show,
america's
most
wanted.
several
viewers
recognized
kindler
and
notified
canadian
authorities
who
arrested
him
and
sent
him
back
to
the
united
states.
now
once
back
in
pennsylvania
state
court,
kindler
filed
a
motion
to
reinstate
his
post
verdict
challenges,
but
the
state
courts
would
have
none
of
it.
they
applied
what
is
known
as
the
fugitive
forfeiture
rule
and
held
that
kindler
had
forfeited
his
challenges
by
escaping
from
prison.
kindler
then
filed
this
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
to
get
his
claims
heard
despite
the
state
rule.
now
there
is
something
called
the
adequate
state
ground
doctrine
under
which
a
federal
habeas
court
will
not
review
the
claim
that
has
been
rejected
by
a
state
court
on
the
basis
of
the
state
law
ground.
the
state
law
ground
however
has
to
be
independent
of
the
federal
claim
and
adequate
to
support
the
judgment.
the
federal
district
court
here
granted
kindler's
habeas
petition,
determining
that
the
state
fugitive
forfeiture
rule
did
not
provide
an
adequate
basis
to
bar
kindler's
habeas
claims.
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
pennsylvania
filed
a
petition
for
review
in
this
court.
it
argued
that
the
third
circuit
had
held
the
fugitive
forfeiture
rule
automatically
inadequate
simply
because
the
state
courts
had
discretion
in
applying
it.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
a
state
procedural
rule
is
not
automatically
inadequate
under
the
adequate
state
ground
doctrine
just
because
the
state
rule
is
discretionary
rather
than
mandatory.
a
discretionary
state
rule
can
serve
as
an
adequate
ground
to
bar
federal
habeas
review
even
if
the
appropriate
exercise
of
discretion
permits
consideration
of
a
federal
claim
in
some
cases,
but
not
others.
a
contrary
holding
would
pose
an
unnecessary
dilemma
for
the
states.
states
could
preserve
flexibility
in
their
rules
by
granting
courts
discretion
to
excuse
procedural
errors,
but
only
at
the
cost
of
undermining
the
finality
of
state
court
judgments
or
states
could
preserve
the
finality
of
their
judgments
by
withholding
such
discretion,
but
only
at
the
cost
of
precluding
any
flexibility
in
applying
the
rules.
now
a
number
of
the
states
participating
as
amici
curiae
before
this
court
have
told
us
that
if
forced
to
choose,
they
would
opt
for
mandatory
rules
to
avoid
the
high
costs
that
come
with
plenary
federal
review.
that
would
be
very
unfortunate
because
the
discretionary
rules
are
often
desirable.
the
result
would
be
particularly
unfortunate
for
criminal
defendants
who
would
lose
the
opportunity
to
argue
that
a
procedural
default
should
be
excused
through
the
exercise
of
judicial
discretion.
both
state
and
federal
systems
grant
broad
discretion
to
the
trial
judge
in
many
cases.
in
light
of
the
principles
of
federalism
that
underlie
the
adequate
state
ground
doctrine
in
the
first
place,
it
would
seem
particularly
strange
to
disregard
state
procedural
rules
that
are
substantially
similar
to
those
to
which
we
give
full
force
in
our
own
courts.
accordingly
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
all
members
of
the
court
join
the
opinion
of
the
court
except
justice
alito
who
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
