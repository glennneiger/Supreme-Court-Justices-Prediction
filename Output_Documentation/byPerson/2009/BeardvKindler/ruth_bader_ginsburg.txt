justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
understand
the
third
circuit
rule
to
equate
discretion
with
inadequacy.
i
thought
their
position
was
--
the
assertion
was
that
the
rule
was
mandatory;
that
is,
if
you
are
fugitives,
you
are
out
forever.
but
in
fact,
at
the
time
that
kindler
fled,
the
rule
was
discretionary,
so
the
mandatory
rule
hadn't
been
firmly
established.
that's
what
i
thought
the
third
circuit
held.
it
did
not
equate
discretion
with
inadequacy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fugitive
forfeiture
rule
that
they
were
talking
about
was
the
--
the
mandatory
rule
wasn't
firmly
established.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
that
the
defendant
might
not
have
escaped
if
he
knew
that
the
rule
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
question
that
you
present
--
i
mean,
you
state
it
forthrightly
in
your
brief,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
7,
you
say:
"the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
this
court's
precedent
to
compel
a
finding
of
inadequacy
for
any
state
procedural
rule
that
permits
the
state
courts
to
exercise
a
degree
of
discretion.
"
"any
discretion
is
inadequate.
"
that's
what
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
this
court's
precedent
to
say:
discretion,
inadequate.
well,
i'm
looking
first
at
the
petition
appendix
page
62,
which
describes
the
district
court's
understanding,
which
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
it
says:
"an
occasional
act
of
grace
by
a
state
court
in
excusing
or
disregarding
a
state
procedural
rule
does
not
render
the
rule
inadequate
to
procedurally
bar
advancing
a
habeas
claim
in
district
court.
"
well,
that's
saying,
yes,
you
can
have
a
rule
with
discretion,
not
to
follow
the
rule
woodenly,
and
that
doesn't
make
it
inadequate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
you
want
to
modify
then
what
you
said?
you
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
any
--
any
degree
of
discretion
means
that
the
rule
is
inadequate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
makes
--
makes
this
particularly
puzzling
is
you
are
attributing
a
rule
to
the
third
circuit
that
that
very
circuit
in
campbell
v.
burris
said
was
not
a
tool.
in
the
--
in
campbell
v.
burris,
the
third
circuit
said
a
state
procedural
rule
can't
be,
cannot
be
rendered
per
se
inadequate
merely
because
it
allows
for
some
exercise
of
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
would
be
really
odd,
considering
that
one
member
of
the
panel
was
on
both
cases,
stapleton,
and
these
cases
are
in
the
same
year,
for
at
least
that
judge
not
to
think
that
what
he
said
in
the
one
case
was
in
no
conflict
with
what
he
said
in
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's
the
interest
in
not
applying
this
in
this
case?
as
you
say,
that's
a
fine
rule.
if
you
are
a
fugitive,
you
are
out.
you
say
that
wasn't
the
rule
at
the
time
he
escaped.
but
you
are
not
asserting
any
reliance
interest
by
the
escapee,
that,
gee,
if
i
knew
that
the
rule
was
going
to
be
mandatory,
i
wouldn't
have
a
chance
to
appeal
to
the
discretion,
i
wouldn't
have
escaped.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
absence
of
notice
that
--
that
matters.
i
mean,
if
he
had
notice
he
would
have
still
escaped,
i
assume.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
said
that
it
would
be
okay
to
have
a
rule
going
forward
that
if
you
are
a
fugitive,
you
are
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
a
certain
irony
that
the
case
you're
relying
on
on
the
merits
is
mills,
where
if
he
hadn't
escaped
he
would
have
gone
through
the
whole
process
before
mills
was
decided.
