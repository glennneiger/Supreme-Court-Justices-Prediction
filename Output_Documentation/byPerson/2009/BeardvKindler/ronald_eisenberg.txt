mr.
ronald
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
joseph
kindler,
after
attacking
the
judicial
process
by
murdering
a
witness
against
him,
again
repudiated
that
process
by
breaking
out
of
prison
twice
and
fleeing
the
country.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
honor
the
resulting
procedural
default
on
the
ground
that
it
was
inadequate
because
discretionary.
this
court
should
clarify
that
the
purpose
of
the
adequate
state
grounds
doctrine
isn't
to
strip
state
courts
of
their
equitable
power
to
excuse
procedural
defaults,
but
simply
to
ensure
that
they
don't
discriminate
against
federal
claims
under
the
guise
of
procedural
ruling.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
that
was
the
--
the
argument
presented,
but
i
think
what
the
third
circuit
held
was
simply
to
equate
discretion
with
inadequacy.
but
in
any
case,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i
don't
think
we
really
have
to
guess,
your
honor.
i
think,
looking,
for
example,
in
the
third
appendix
at
the
top
of
page
22,
where
the
third
circuit
is
characterizing
its
prior
law
in
this
question:
"after
surveying
decisions
of
the
pennsylvania
courts,
we
concluded
that
the
pennsylvania
courts
had
discretion
to
hear
an
appeal
filed
by
a
fugitive
who
had
been
returned
to
custody
before
an
appeal
was
initiated
and
dismissed.
"
"accordingly,
the
fugitive-forfeiture
rule
was
not
firmly
established
and,
therefore,
is
not
an
independent
and
adequate
procedural
rule.
"
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
this
language,
in
and
of
itself,
your
honor.
but
it
really
doesn't
matter
for
our
position,
and
that's
because
the
rule
that
was
applied
to
this
defendant
was
a
discretionary
rule.
the
pennsylvania
--
the
trial
court
in
this
case
exercised
his
discretion
not
to
reinstate
post-verdict
motions.
the
opinion
that
was
written
by
the
trial
court
and
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
--
i
believe
it's
69,
your
honor
--
states
that
the
question
was
whether
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
declining
to
reinstate
post-trial
motions.
when
the
case
that
your
honor's--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--your
honor,
i
think
the
problem
here
and
the
reason
that
we
are
at
this
point
is
that,
whether
the
test
is
stated
directly
as
being
a
per
se
ban
on
discretion
or
whether
simply
the
standard
is
so
high
under
an
interpretation
of
"firmly
established"
that
allows
for
virtually
no
deviation
in
results
by
the
state
courts,
the
effect
is
the
same.
it's
to
drive
out
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
state
courts.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--justice
sotomayor,
the
state
didn't
argue
in
federal
court
that
the
state
rule
was
mandatory.
we
were
very
explicit.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
the
problem
is
that
the
third
circuit
did
not
engage
in
any
inquiry
about
the
nature
of
the
rule
that
was
applied
to
this
defendant,
so
it
was
not
in
any
position
to
say
that
a
different
rule
was
applied
to
this
defendant
than
the
rule
that
should
have
been
applied.
that's
the
problem
with
the
argument
that
a
new
rule
was
sprung
on
this
defendant.
the
rule
that
was
applied
to
this
defendant
was
discretion,
and
the
third
circuit
never
discusses
anything
other
than
that.
they
reject
our
argument
that
the
underlying
rule
was
mandatory
in
that
language,
but
they
never
discuss
what
rule
was
actually
applied
to
this
defendant.
we
think
it
was
clearly
a
discretionary
rule.
but
the
--
the
real
question
is
whether,
at
the
time
of
the
default,
the
default
that
occurred
by
the
extraordinary
act
of
escaping,
the
defendant
was
not
fairly
apprised
of
the
consequences
of
his
action.
and,
really,
whether
or
not
the
rule--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--well,
i
think
that's
the
irony
of
applying
this
sort
of
adequacy
analysis
to
this
kind
of
default,
but
that,
i
think,
is
more
of
a
problem
for
kindler
than
for
the
commonwealth.
this
court
has
consistently
held
in
its
adequacy
cases
that
the
litigant
must
have
ample
opportunity
to
comply
with
the
state's
procedure.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
what
we
are
presenting
is
that
the
nature
of
the
state
rule
here
was
--
was
such
that
the
defendant
had
reasonable
notice
of
what
he
was
facing
by
escaping,
whether
or
not
it
would
have
affected
his
subjective
decision
to
escape,
and
therefore
that
the
state
ground
can't
be
thrown
out
in
federal
court
on
the
ground
of
adequacy.
and
really,
whether
the
rule
was
strictly
mandatory
in
1984
or
discretionary
doesn't
much
matter
for
purposes
of
putting
the
defendant
on
notice
that
if
he
escaped,
he
was
going
to
run
into
serious
trouble
trying
to
appeal
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
trying
to
stay
in
canada
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
that's
what
this
case
is
really
all
about.
and
yet,
the
lower
courts
i
think
have
so
misconstrued
this
court's
adequacy
doctrine
that
they
have
come
to
the
point
of
saying
that
even
in
that
situation,
the
rule
is
inadequate
and
can
be
ignored
in
federal
court.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
your
honor--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
25
states,
you
will
see
that
that
there
are
a
great
many
cases
where
that's
exactly
the
analysis
that
the
courts
have
applied,
and
in
many
of
those
cases
they
have
required
the
parties
to
place
before
them
dozens
and
sometimes
hundreds
of
other
examples
of
the
operation
of
a
state
procedural
rule
so
that
the
lower
federal
court
can
decide
whether
that--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i
think
in
california,
for
example,
it's
been
quite
common.
the
state's
rule
for
timeliness
of
post-conviction
communications
is
seldom
enforced
in
federal
court,
as
we
learned
from
the
amicus
brief.
in
fact,
it
virtually
doesn't
exist.
and
even
in
those
cases
where
the
courts--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i
think
what
it
tells
us
is
that
the
lower
courts
are
applying
a
very
different
adequacy
rule
than
this
court
has
been
applying.
we
are
not
really
asking
for
some
kind
of
new
rule
from
this
court
as
compared
to
your
prior
line
of
cases
on
adequacy.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
the
question
is
what
those
circumstances
are,
your
honor.
and
in
virtually
case
after
case,
the
circumstances
that
have
been
identified
by
this
court
for
actually
finding
a
rule
inadequate
are
that
the
state
rule
was
some
kind
of
bait
and
switch,
that
it
was
a
--
to
use
justice
holmes'
classic
formulation,
that
it
was
a
spring
--
a
trap
that
was
sprung
on
the
defendant.
one
rule
existed
at
the
time
that
the
litigant
was
proceeding,
another
rule
was
applied
when
the
case
reached
appeal.
and
that
is
characteristically
what
has
made
this
court,
not
the
lower
federal
courts,
but
this
court,
hold
that
rules
were
actually
inadequate.
so
in
ford
v.
georgia,
for
example,
where
the
defendant
raised
a
batson
claim
after
the
jury
was
sworn,
because
that's
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
when
the
case
reached
appeal
the
appellate
--
the
state
appellate
court
said:
no,
no;
we
have
a
new
rule
now;
you
have
to
do
it
before
the
jury
is
sworn.
and
they
found
his
claim
waived.
that
rule
was
inadequate.
in
james
v.
kentucky,
where
the
defendant
asked
for
an
adverse
inference
charge
and
he
asked
for
an
admonition
rather
than
an
instruction,
and
the
state
court
said,
no,
no,
it
was
supposed
to
be
an
instruction
rather
than
an
admonition,
that
was
a
reversal
of
prior
state
law.
there
are
many
cases
very
much
like
that
where
there
is
a
spring
set
by
the
state
in
the
sense
that
a
different
rule
is
applied
on
appeal
than
was
before
the
litigant
at
the
time
that
he
was
trying
to
comply
with
the
rule.
now,
this
case
obviously
is
quite
far
from
that,
and
that's
exactly
why
this
case
should
have
been
the
last
sort
of
case
where
a
rule
was
found
inadequate.
the
higher
the
standard
that
the
lower
courts
apply,
the
stricter
the
standard
that
the
lower
federal
courts
apply
to
analyze
the
adequacy
of
state
rules,
the
less
opportunity
there
will
be
for
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
states.
and
the
loser
in
that
equation,
while
it
might
not
be
this
defendant,
will
be
the
vast
majority
of
defendants
who
would
have
been
more
entitled,
more
deserving
of
discretion,
of
leniency
from
the
state
courts.
the
state
courts
need
to
be
allowed
to
apply
the
kind
of
discretion
in
their
procedural
rulings
that
this
court
applies,
that
the
federal
courts
are
allowed
in
--
in
federal
procedural
rulings
--
for
example,
under
the
plain
error
rule,
even
under
the
federal
fugitive-forfeiture
rule.
in
1876
this
court
said
that
it's
within
our
discretion
to
dismiss
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
a
fugitive,
and
since
then,
while
there
have
been
a
number
of
decisions
from
this
court
concerning
fugitive
defendants,
none
of
them
have
laid
out
the
sort
of
menu,
the
sort
of
standards
and
substandards
and
subrules
that
the
defendant
is
now
arguing
have
to
be
present
in
a
rule
for
it
to
be
adequate.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
justice
ginsburg,
an
occasional
act
of
grace,
that
level
of
--
of
leniency
or
flexibility
that
would
be
allowed
by
the
district
court's
view
of
the
law,
or
the
third
circuit's,
is
simply
not
appropriate
in
judging
the
adequacy
of
state
grounds.
it's
certainly
not
the
kind
of
miserly,
crabbed
review
of
the
exercise
of
discretion
that
occurs
in
federal
procedural
rulings
like
the
plain
error
rule.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
justice
ginsburg,
we
say
that
because
there
was
no
analysis
here
of
what
degree
of
discretion
or
whether
discretion
was
actually
applied
by
the
state
court
in
this
case.
that's
why,
in
effect,
we
say
that
the
third
circuit's
ruling
was
about
the
per
se
exercise
of
discretion.
but
even
if
it
wasn't
automatically
about
the
exercise
of
discretion,
even
if
it
was
merely
applying
a
rule
which
is
so
narrow
and
strict
that
in
practical
effect
the
state
courts
have
little
actual
discretion
to
exercise,
that's
still
a
problem
and
it's
still
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
adequate
state
grounds
doctrine,
which
was
never
intended
to
allow
federal
courts
or
to
require
lower
federal
courts
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
analysis
that
many
of
the
lower
federal
courts
are
now
undertaking.
basically,
they
--
they
are
taking
out
their
magnifying
glasses
and
starting
to
split
hairs
by
looking
at
every
single
case,
by
looking
at
how
those
cases
compare
to
each
other,
by
deciding
whether
there's
enough
of
a
standard,
is
there
enough
of
a
precedent,
did
you
tell
this
little
particular
little
fact
to
the
defendant
before.
that
sort
of
analysis
is
not
part
of
this
court's
adequacy
doctrine.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
and
i
think
if
the
third
circuit
had
applied
that
statement
in
this
case,
there
might
have
been
a
different
result
and
at
the
very
least
there
would
have
been
additional
analysis,
because
that
calls
for
additional
analysis
beyond
the
absolute
lack
of
analysis
in
this
opinion
about
the
nature
of
the
rule
that
was
actually
applied
to
this
defendant.
without
that
sort
of
analysis,
you
can't
say
that
the
court
is
looking
at
whether
this
--
this
particular
exercise
of
discretion
came
within
the
small
window
that
that
court
would
allow
to
the
states.
that
--
that--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--and
yet
we
have
a
result,
your
honor,
which
is
explainable
only
on
the
ground
that
the
state
court
rule
maintains
some
power
of
discretion
by
the
state
courts.
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
opinion
that
explains
the
result
in
this
case.
but
i
emphasize
again
that,
even
if
the
court
had
applied
a
different
rule,
the
rule
that
it
said
it
was
applying
in
some
of
the
third
circuit's
other
panel
opinions,
we
would
still
be
left
with
a
standard
which
is
far
narrower
than
anything
that
this
court
has
actually
applied
in
its
own
decisions.
there
have
been
a
variety
of
phrases
in
the
court's
decisions,
things
like
"firmly
established",
"strictly
followed",
"regularly
applied".
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
an
analysis
of
whether
the
law
was
--
was
established
at
the
time
of
the
waiver,
your
honor,
because
what
the
court
says,
or
at
least
what
the
precedents
it
rely
on
say,
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
waiver
here,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
that's
the
relevant
inquiry,
the
rule
was
discretionary.
the
question
then
has
to
be,
was
that
rule
applied
to
the
defendant?
if
a
different
rule
is
applied
to
the
defendant,
if
the
difference--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--your
honor--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--that
wasn't
state
law
in
fact,
your
honor.
the
state
courts
didn't
make
the
kind
of
decision
that
the
federal
court,
not
actually
in
this
case,
but
in
the
case
that
it
cited,
doctor,
tried
to
make.
that
is
a
distinction
that
doctor
invented
from
state
law.
it
is
not
a
distinction
that
the
state
cases
announced
themselves.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
that
would
have
been
clearer,
i
think,
if
we
were
appealing
from
the
doctor
decision
here
now
rather
than
from
this
decision,
but
i
think
that
there
is
at
the
very
least
a
great
degree
of
unclarity
in
exactly
what
the--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--that
is
what
doctor
said
was
a
distinction
in
state
law.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
doctor
said
that.
only
that
federal
court
said
that.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
in
fact,
not
a
new
question
at
all
under
state
law,
your
honor.
and
we
have
cited
several
state
court
opinions--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i
think
that's
at
least
where
the
disagreement
lie
--
lay
between
the
commonwealth
and
kindler
below.
as
i
say,
i
think
there's
a
great--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--then
the
question
becomes,
your
honor,
whether
the
alleged
discrepancy,
difference
in
the
state
law
or
--
or
degree
of
unclarity
is
sufficient
to
meet
this
court's
adequacy
test.
and
that's
where
i
think
we
get
back
to
federal
analogies
like
the
federal
fugitive
flight
rule.
and
i'd
like
to
address
that
--
that
question,
and
then
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
under
the
federal
fugitive
flight
rule,
many
of
these
kinds
of
distinctions
have
never
been
spelled
out.
the
courts
simply
laid
out
a
general
rule
starting
in
the
late
1800s
that
it
was
within
our
discretion
to
dismiss.
but
despite
the
fact
that
the
court
hasn't
basically
subdivided
the
rule
with
the
nit-picking
analysis
that
the
doctor
court
tried
to
impose
on
the
pennsylvania
cases,
that
doesn't
make
the
fugitive
forfeiture
rule
inadequate
and
therefore
inapplicable
to
defendants.
in
fact,
even
after
this
court's
decision
in
ortega-rodriguez,
which
overturned
an
automatic
forfeiture
rule
on
--
applied
by
the
federal
court
of
appeals,
the
court
allowed
the
district
court's
discretion
to
carry
out
the
fugitive-forfeiture
rule
as
they
saw
fit
under
the
circumstances.
and
the
day
after
ortega-rodriguez,
despite
the
fact
that
no
substandards
had
yet
been
developed,
there
was
still
a
federal
fugitive-forfeiture
rule--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
that's
an
excellent
example
of
what
i
was
just
saying.
the
fact
that
the
general
rule
of
fugitive
forfeiture
hadn't
yet
addressed
the
subquestion
of
whether
there
should
be
an
exception
for
capital
defendants
did
not
render
the
state
rule
inadequate.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
no,
your
honor.
at
this
time,
there
was
simply
a
rule
that
said
that
in
capital
cases
we
will
apply
a
limited
form
of
relaxation
of
our
--
of
our
rules
to
address
significant
questions.
when
you
look
at
that
language,
it's
almost
exactly
the
same
as
the
federal
plain
error
rule.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
no,
your
honor.
there
had
only
been
a
few
capital
cases
even
decided
at
the
time
of
the
flight
here.
the
point
is
that
the
way
that
the--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--at
that
time,
i
think
they
had
not
yet,
but
really,
there
are
only
a
handful
of--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i
don't
think
you
have
a
firmly
established
rule,
your
honor,
because
you
have
--
the
firmly
established
rule
was
the
preexisting
rule
requiring
preservation
of
error
claims,
in
the
same
way
that
under
the
federal
plain
error
rule
the
rule
is
you
have
to
preserve
your
claims.
a
defendant
cannot
come
along
and
say:
hey,
in
rule
52(b)
it
says
that
if
my
claim
is
plain
and
significant
it's
not
waived,
and
therefore
i
have
no
obligation
to
ever
preserve
my
claims.
the
federal
plain
error
rule
is
an
exception
that
might
apply
to
you,
but
it
doesn't
do
away
with
the
underlying
rule
of
issue
preservation.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
mr.
lawry's
answer
to
the
question
about
a
mandatory
forfeiture
rule,
your
honors,
i
think
is
the
crucial
one
here.
when
asked
whether
an
automatic
mandatory
forfeiture
rule
would
be
adequate,
he
said
yes.
and
i
think
that's
the
problem
with
just
trying
to
remand
this
case
without
doing
more,
because
that's
where
you
wind
up.
if
the
lower
federal
courts
continue
to
undertake
the
kind
of
consistency
analysis
that
they
think
consistency
requires,
it
will
drive
that
sort
of
discretion
out,
and
you
will
wind
up
with
forfeiture
rules
and
other
state
procedural
rules
that
are
all
automatic,
because
that's
the
way
the
federal
courts
will
be
telling
the
state
courts
that
their
rules
will
be
found
adequate
state
grounds
and
enforceable
on
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
there
was
no
subterfuge
here
the
--
to
avoid
or
evade
the
federal
question.
the
argument
in
favor
of
that
position
is:
look
at
all
the
other
cases
where
the
state
court
did
address
federal
constitutional
questions.
well,
exactly.
of
course
we
did
in
many
other
capital
cases.
and
the
--
the
penalty
for
trying
to
be
lenient
in
those
other
cases
is
that
now
in
the
worst
case
we
can't
apply
any
sort
of
forfeiture,
any
sort
of
procedural
bar,
even
for
a
guy
who
breaks
out
of
jail
twice.
the
state
court--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--that
defendant
was
gone
less
than
two
weeks.
and,
so,
we
withdrew
our
motion
to
quash
his
appeal.
it's
not
just
that
the
state
court
didn't
grant
it,
we
withdrew
it
because
he
was
recaptured
in
new
york
two
weeks
later.
this
guy
was
out
for
seven
years.
after
he
was
captured
the
first
time
in
canada
and
started
to
fight
extradition,
his
post
verdict
motions
were
dismissed.
the
motions
that
he
had
been
--
and
told
him
that
under
state
law
at
that
time
were
absolutely
essential
to
preserving
any
claim
for
further
review,
and
his
response
to
the
dismissal
of
his
post
verdict
motions
after
the
first
escape
was
to
break
out
of
jail
again
a
second
time.
during
the
second
escape,
somebody
died,
another
prisoner
fell
to
his
death.
during
the
first
escape
the
plan,
the
diversion
that
allowed
this
defendant
to
sneak
out
through
the
window
he
sought
through
was
to
have
a
riot
staged
on
the
part
of
the
other
prisoners,
during
which
they
tried
to
push
one
of
the
prison
guards
off
the
third
tier
of
the
prison
cells
to
the
floor
below.
that
would
--
that
caused
all
the
other
guards
to
rush
up.
during
that
time
the
defendant
slipped
out
the
window.
that's
why
this
was
the
case
where
the
court
exercised
its
discretion
to
impose
a
procedural
bar.
mr.
lawry
says,
well,
the
commonwealth
just
wants
to
execute
him
without
any
sort
of
review.
he
did
have
limited
review,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
but
really
you
are
left
with
only
the
two
choices
of
imposing
a
procedural
bar,
a
bar
that
this
court
said
was
longstanding
and
well
established
in
american
law
in
estelle
v.
dorrough--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--or
else
leaving
the
defendant
better
off
than
he
would
otherwise
have
been.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
no,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
reason
the
case
is
worth
being
here
is
to
provide
greater
guidance
than
to
that
provide
to
the
lower
courts.
i
think
the
reason
so
many
states
have
weighed
in
on
this
question--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i'm
afraid
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
help
resolve
the
--
the
path
to
which
the
third
circuit
got
to
that
point.
and
that's
really
the
underlying
problem.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
confusion
about
this
court's
adequate
state
grounds
doctrine.
not,
i
would
suggest,
so
much
in
the
results
that
this
case
--
that
this
court
has
reached,
not
in
the
kind
of
inadequacies
that
this
court
has
found,
which
by
and
large
deals
with
retroactivity
or
civil
rights
era
cases
where
the
courts
--
the
state
courts
were
clearly
discriminating
against
black
defendants
in
favor
of
white
defendants.
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
here.
