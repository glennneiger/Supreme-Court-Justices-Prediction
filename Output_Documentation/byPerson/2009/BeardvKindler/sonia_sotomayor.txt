justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
wasn't
the
ruling
by
the
court
in
analyzing
your
cases
and
saying
--
you
know,
in
six
out
of
the
cases
--
six
out
of
the
ten
cases,
discretion
was
exercised,
in
four
it
wasn't,
and
so
it's
not
firmly
established
because
the
numbers
are
skewed.
justice
ginsburg
--
you
pointed
justice
ginsburg
to
page
23,
and
the
court
very
directly
there
says,
look,
we
are
rejecting
the
state's
argument
that
the
waiver
rule
was
mandatory.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
it
characterized
your
argument
that
way,
that
you
were
saying
the
district
court
had
no
discretion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
whether
you
think
you
did
or
didn't,
that's
how
the
court
described
it,
so
it
understood
you
to
be
taking
a
different
position.
are
we
going
to
correct
it
because
it
misunderstood
you?
or--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
court
has
said?
as
i
read
the
third
circuit,
it
says:
a
procedural
rule
that
is
consistently
applied
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases;
even
if
state
courts
are
willing
to
occasionally
overlook
it
and
review
the
merits
of
a
claim,
that
that's
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
other
circuit
has
said
that
any
measure
of
discretion
or
even
a
lot
of
use
of
discretion
bars
deference
to
the
state
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
of
those
cases
resulted
in
the
overturning
or
the
grant
of
habeas--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
do
we
--
what
--
what
does
that
tell
us
about
us
establishing
the
rule
that
you
propose?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are
asking
us
to
take
away
a
part
of
the
inquiry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
notice
--
your
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
comply
doesn't
address
a
repeated
statement
by
us,
which
is
that
whatever
test
is
applied
has
to
get
to
whether
the
state
court
is
attempting
to
evade
federal
review
of
constitutional
questions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
and
so
your
test
does
nothing
to
inform
that
question,
for
example,
the
flowers
situation.
there
was
a
clear
rule,
there
was
more
than
an
adequate
opportunity
to
comply,
and
yet
we
said
it
didn't
qualify
for
deference
because
it
was
clearly,
given
the
circumstances
of
the
state
application
of
the
rule
at
issue,
an
attempt
to
evade
a
constitutional
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
don't
know
how
you
say
that.
yes,
it
was
clearly
established
that
the
district
court
had
discretion
--
none
of
the
justices
below
disagreed
with
this
--
to
dismiss
post-verdict
motions
on
the
basis
of
flight.
the
courts
below
themselves
said:
what
we
don't
have
a
rule
about
is
what
we
do
with
respect
to
a
post-judgment
motion
to
reinstate
or
how
we
the
appellate
court
will
treat
that
waiver
once
it
comes
before
us.
will
we
apply
it
to
the
appellate
process
as
well?
i
understood
the
third
circuit
to
be
saying
that
it
was
those
two
latter
components,
which
the
courts
below
themselves
identified
as
new
questions,
that
it
was
resolving,
that
involve
new
rules.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
as
simply
as
i
thought
the
issue
was.
maybe
your
adversary
will
dissuade
me
and
concede
your
point
that
what
the
court
was
saying,
the
discretionary
application,
is
what
was
at
issue,
but
if
as
i've
described
things
is
correct,
how
does
your
position
continue
to
be
sustained?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you
are
disagreeing
with
is
the
third
circuit's
conclusion
of
what
the
status
of
pennsylvania
law
was?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
doctor
dealt
with
what
will
the
court
do
with
respect
to,
not
post-verdict
motions,
but
with
respect
to
appeals
that
are
raised
before
or
after
flight.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that's
what
doctor
said?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
the
only
other
--
kindler
now
raises
a
new
question:
what
are
we
going
to
do
--
according
to
the
courts
below,
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
post-verdict
motions
to
reinstate
and
to
appeals
that
result
after
flight
and
after
waiver;
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
where
the
disagreement
lies:
did
the
third
circuit
get
pennsylvania
law
wrong
on
this
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
let's
assume
the
third
circuit,
that
we
take
the
hypothetical
that
they
were
right.
how
do
you
still
win?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
rules
--
i'm--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
is
--
what
is
your
position
as
to
what
the
third
circuit
was
saying
or
holding?
are
you
saying,
like
your
adversary,
that
they
were
saying
because
it
was
discretionary
and
there
were
a
lot
of
exceptions
to
it,
it
wasn't
firmly
established?
or
were
you
--
or
do
you
read
it
as
saying,
now
that
you
have
made
it
mandatory,
that's
a
new
rule
--
the
waiver
mandatory,
that's
a
new
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
not
what
you
are
saying.
what
do
you
think
the
third
circuit
said?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
was
the
change--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
you
think
the
third
circuit
was
identifying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
that
a
lower
court
in
this
case
had
said:
you
know,
we
have
discretion,
but
we're
not
going
to
exercise
it
because
you
escaped
twice
and
were
away
much
longer
than
most
fugitives.
there
is
a
presumption
that
witnesses'
memories
fade,
that
it's
harder
for
trials
that
are
so
distant
from
the
event,
that
distant
from
an
event.
we
are
not
going
to
exercise
our
discretion.
is
it
your
view
--
because
that's
the
undertone
i'm
hearing
--
that
under
firmly
established
ground
that
the
court
would
have
still
ruled
that
that
exercise
of
discretion
was
not
adequate
under--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--yeah.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
sure,
it
is.
but
what
you
--
there
is
a
tone
to
the
way
you
presented
this
case
that
says
because
they
chose
often
to
exercise
discretion
in
the
past,
if
they
choose
not
to
in
any
case,
it's
no
longer
an
independent
state
ground.
that's
what
--
is
that
the
point
you
are
arguing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
that's
the
question
presented.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
begs
your
adversary's
question,
which
is
every
case
has
one
or
more
differences
in
it.
at
what
point
does
a
lower
court
have
to
--
can
it
say,
you
know,
yes,
because
they
exercised
discretion
sometimes
but
not
others
it's
still
an
independent
state
ground
to
find
forfeiture?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
by
whom?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
stop.
is
the
relaxed
waiver
rule
one
that
applies
to
district
court
consideration
or
appellate
court
consideration
or
both?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
all
levels.
what
is
your
reading
of
what
the
new
rule
that
the
state
was
announcing
was
announcing?
that
it
was
doing
away
with
the
state
court's
relaxed
waiver
rule?
was
it
doing
it
away
with
its
own
relaxed
waiver
rule?
what's
your
position
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
none
of
them,
including
the
trial
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
by
the
trial
court
and
by
us,
is
that
what
you're--
