mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
first
want
to
address
what
is
really
at
stake
here.
the
commonwealth
wants
this
court
to
change
the
adequate
state
ground
doctrine
so
that
mr.
kindler
may
be
executed
with
no
review
by
any
court
of
his
meritorious
claims
that
his
death
sentence
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
the
question
is,
was
there
a
firmly
established
and
consistently
applied
state
rule
that
would
result
in
all
of
his
claims
being
taken
away.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
no,
i
don't
think
that,
your
honor.
what
--
what
--
what
this
court
has
always
required
and
what
we
are
arguing,
this
court
has
always
required
that
a
state
procedural
rule
be
firmly
established
and
consistently
applied
in
order
to
take
away
a
litigant's
claims.
and
our
position
and
what
the
third
circuit
below
held
was
that
in
numerous
respects,
the
--
the
rules
that
the
state
court
applied
here
were
not
firmly
established
or
consistently
applied.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
it's
really--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--well
--
well,
to
begin
with,
what
we're
saying
is
that--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--what
--
what
i
would
suggest
the
third
circuit
said
is
that
this
case
is
very
like
doctor.
it
said
doctor
was
controlling
precedent,
and
doctor
involved
a
defendant
who
fled
pretrial
or
in
the
middle
of
trial,
and
at
that
time
there
was
a
sort
of
two-part
rule
in
pennsylvania
for
dealing
with
fugitive
forfeiture.
one
part
was
--
and
this
is
in
noncapital
cases.
one
part
was
if
the
defendant
flees
during
the
appellate
process,
then
the
appeal
could
be
dismissed.
the
other
part
was
if
it's
any
time
before
that,
there
is
discretion.
and
--
and
so,
when
doctor
appealed,
by
the
time
his
appeal
was
heard,
pennsylvania
had
changed
its
rule
completely
to
one
in
which
a
flight
at
any
time,
at
any
time
at
all,
was
considered
a
complete
forfeiture.
and
that
was
--
it
was
that
change
from
a
discretionary
rule
to
a
forfeiture
rule
that
the
third
circuit
said
in
doctor
was
inadequate.
and
it
said
again
in
kindler
that
the
same
kind
of
change
was
inadequate.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
the
change--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--the
change
that
the
third
circuit
identified
was
from
a
--
a
situation
where
there
was
complete
discretion
--
and
really
more
often
than
not,
even
in
noncapital
cases,
the
discretion
was
exercised
to
hear
the
issues.
it
changed
from
that
to
one
where
there
is
essentially
a
--
a
presumption
of
--
of
waiver
or
forfeiture
and
some
potential
way
to--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--that
the
third
circuit
would
have
said
that?
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
it's
a
very
--
it's
a
very
different
case.
i
think
if--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--no.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
that's
not
the
point
that
we
are
arguing.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
there
needs
to
be
consistent
application
of
the
rules.
and--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--there
--
there
are
several
things
that
are
important
in
this
kind
of
situation.
one
is
how
--
it's
really
how
is
the
rule
being
applied.
and
if
--
if
the
rule
is
--
if
there
is
a
situation
where
--
where
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
the
rule
is
being
applied
to
deny
review
and
there
are
occasional
acts
of
grace,
that's
one
thing.
it's
very
different
when
almost
every
time
the
situation
comes
up
review
is
allowed
and
then
in
the
occasional
exception,
without
explanation,
it's
taken
away.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
no,
it
is
not
automatically
inadequate.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
it's
not
our
position--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--and
we
don't
think
that
the
--
that
the
third
circuit
said--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--correct.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
correct.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
i
would
have
no
objection
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
part
of
the
problem
here
is
that
--
that
pennsylvania
law
and
what
the
pennsylvania
rule
is
was
a
moving
target
throughout
this
time
period.
there
was
the
--
the
discretionary
sort
of
regime
under
galloway
which
--
which
did
hold
as
doctor
describes
it.
then
there
was
a
time
period
when
there
was
absolute
forfeiture.
then
there
was
another
time
period
where
they
backed
away
from
that.
and
so
that
--
that
kind
of
shifting,
of
turning
procedural
rules
on
and
off,
is
the
antithesis
of
consistent
application
of
rules.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
acknowledge
that
it's
a
bit
cryptic,
but
i
think
because
the
third
circuit
in
kindler
said
that
doctor
is
what's
controlling
in
its
analysis,
i
think
you
really
have
to
read
it
in
light
of
doctor.
and
doctor
makes
very
clear
that
what
the
third
circuit
was
looking
at
there
was
a
change
from
a
discretionary
rule
to
a
mandatory
rule.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
actually
our
client
didn't
get
the
benefit
of
a
number
of
things
that
were
clearly
established
law
in
pennsylvania
at
the
time.
first
off,
there
was
the
policy
of
relaxed
waiver
that
applied
to
all
capital
cases
and
meant
merits
review
of
all
issues.
and--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--well,
it's
not
even
clear,
really,
what
--
what
the
trial
court
was
applying,
but
i
think
that
there
are
--
there
are
a
number
of
serious
problems
with
--
with
the
consistent
application
in
this
case.
if
you
want
to
look
for
just
the
most
obvious
ones,
reginald
lewis,
a
capital
defendant,
and
mr.
kindler
escaped
together,
at
the
same
time,
the
same
day,
together.
mr.
lewis
got
complete
full
review,
merits
review,
of
all
of
his
issues
on
direct
appeal,
all
of
his
issues
in
post-conviction.
mr.
kindler
got
no
review.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
i
--
i
lost
your
train
of
thought
there.
i
apologize.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
no.
i
don't
think--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--that's
--
that's
part
of
what
i'm
arguing.
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
no.
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
arguing
that.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
uh-huh.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
no,
he
is
hurt
if
it
is
now
mandatory,
yes,
because
--
because
it's
--
it's
like
--
it's
like
ford
or
any
of
the
other
cases
where
--
where
the
rules
are
being
changed.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
yes--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--okay.
but
--
but
what
i'm
focusing
on
is
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did,
and
they
did
a
number
of
things.
another
thing
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did
was
they
said,
in
the
direct
appeal
opinion,
mr.
kindler's
flight
makes
his
case
like
somebody
who
affirmatively
goes
and
gives
up
his
direct
appeal
altogether.
all
right.
now,
the
people
that
they
mentioned
who
affirmatively
gave
up
their
direct
appeals
altogether,
when
those
defendants
went
and
sought
post-conviction
relief,
they
got
full
post-conviction
review
in
the
pennsylvania
courts.
when
mr.
kindler
went,
he
got
no
review.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
by
any
--
i'm
sorry.
by
either--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--it
applies
at
all
levels.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
the
--
the
state
courts
simply
did
not
apply
relaxed
waiver
to
mr.
kindler.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
including
--
including
the
trial
court,
yes.
mr.
kindler
asked
for
relaxed
--
in
fact,
when
the
commonwealth
initially
moved
to
dismiss
his
post-verdict
motions,
the
commonwealth
said:
we
know
there
is
this
relaxed
waiver
out
there,
so
if
you
--
if
you
don't
dismiss
his
post-verdict
motions
entirely,
at
least
dismiss
the
guilt
phase
and
consider
his
issues
with
regard
to
capital
sentencing.
the
commonwealth
said
that.
so
--
so
the
--
so
there's
--
there's
no
question
that
--
that,
on
the
pcra
appeal,
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
applied
was
a
mandatory
rule.
they
said
it's
forfeited,
no
review
whatsoever,
and
--
and
that
would
be
the
difference--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--yes,
yes.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
right.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
i
would
--
i
would
actually
direct
you
to
judge
harlan's
opinion
in
sullivan,
where
he
says:
"a
court
has
an
obligation
to
be
reasonably
consistent
and
to
explain
the
decision,
including
the
reason
for
according
different
treatment
to
the
instant
case.
"
but
that
never
happened--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--certainly.
[laughter]
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
the
--
the
key
is
really
consistent
application
and
--
and
looking
to
see
whether
the
rules
are
being
turned
off
and
on.
like
i
would
--
i
would
point
the
court
to
barr
v.
city
of
columbia,
which
i
think
is
a
very
good
example,
where
there
is
maybe
five
people
who
make
the
same
objection,
and
four
of
them
get
merits
review,
and
the
other
person
doesn't
get
merits
review.
now,
maybe
there's
some
explanation
somewhere
for
that,
but
this
court
said:
you
know,
this
is
not
what
we
call
adequacy;
this
is
not
consistent
application.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
it's
certainly--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--well,
it
would
certainly
help
to
give
a
--
a
reasoned
explanation
of
what's
happening.
there
--
you
--
you're
not--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--well,
i
would
--
i
certainly
would
argue
that
there
--
there
is
every
reason
to
see
a
potential
for
the
state
seeking
to
avoid
federal
review.
look
at
the
relaxed
waiver
cases
in
the
attachment
to
the
brief.
there
are
51
cases
over
a
20-year
period
where
the
state
courts
reviewed
every
single
issue
on
the
merits
in
a
capital
case,
regardless
of
what
happened
below.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
but
--
but
during
the
time
period,
during
the
relevant
time
period
in
mr.
kindler's
--
from
his
escape
all
the
way
through
his
pcra
proceedings,
that
was
the
rule.
and
then
they
changed
it,
which
is
similar
to
--
to
some
of
the
other
things
that
we
see
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
oh,
no.
no.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
but
--
but
if
you
want
to
look
at
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
actually
said
here,
they
said
mr.
kindler's
case
is
in
the
category
like
people
who
affirmatively
waive.
okay,
that's
what
they
said
on
direct
appeal.
then
you
look
in
pcra,
on
the
pcra
appeal,
and
they
don't
treat
him
like
the
people
who
affirmatively
waive.
that's
not
consistent
application.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
that
--
certainly,
going
forward
that's
--
that's
an
adequate
rule,
yes.
another
--
another
aspect--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--yes,
but
the
--
the
issue
here
is
not
solely
about
notice
to
mr.
kindler.
there
is
an
issue
also
about
evasion
of
federal
review.
that
goes
right
back
to
ward,
in
like
1920,
talking
about
state
courts
seeking
to
take
away
this
court's
jurisdiction
by--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--but
that
--
but
that's
if
it's
a
firmly
established
rule
that
is
consistently
applied.
and
that's
not
what
we
see
here.
and
let
me
give
you
another
example
of
that.
even
in
a
noncapital
case,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
never
held
that
a
presentencing
flight
meant
that
the
defendant
would
get
no
post-conviction
review.
they
--
they
affirmatively
rejected
that
idea
in
commonwealth
v.
huff.
but
for
mr.
kindler
they
said
a
presentencing
flight
means
no
post-conviction
review.
put
simply--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--the
federal
fugitive
rule
is
--
that
was
set
in
ortega-rodriguez
--
says
that
a
flight
presentencing
does
not
take
away
your
appellate
rights.
it
says
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
how
it
would
want
to
deal
with
that.
it
also--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--it
has
discretion.
it
says,
you
know,
the
blunderbuss
of
dismissal
is
not
--
is
not
an
appropriate
--
is
not
usually
an
appropriate
device,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
the
district
courts
can
do
short
of
taking
away
all
appellate
rights,
no
review
by
any
court
anywhere.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
they
--
they
certainly
could.
the
--
one
of
the
things
that--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--no.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--conviction
review.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
those
were
--
those
were
direct
appeal
things
that
they
looked
at,
yes.
the
--
the
--
those
are
part
of
the
statutory
appellate
review
for
capital
cases
in
pennsylvania.
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
nobody
has
ever
gotten
relief
from
that
statutorily
mandated
direct
appeal
review.
but
in
post-conviction,
they
--
they
gave
no
review
at
all
to
the
post-conviction
claims,
including
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
but
he
may
well
have
gotten
relief
anyway.
he
raised
--
he
actually
raised
an
objection,
a
mills-type
objection
at
trial.
it
was
raised
in
the
post-verdict
motions.
it
would
presumably
have
been
raised
on
direct
appeal.
and
--
and
if
it
had
been
so
raised
on
direct
appeal
he
could
have
--
and
he
didn't
win
on
direct
appeal,
he
could
have
sought
post-conviction
relief
in
pennsylvania
based
on
the
fact
that
mills
came
down
later,
because
the
pennsylvania
retroactivity
rule
is
that
you
can
get
retroactive
application
of
a
decision
if
you
--
if
you
objected.
if
you
raised
the
issue
earlier
and
a
new
decision
comes
down
that
would
help
you,
you
can
raise
that
later.
so
the
idea
of
a
windfall
that
was
raised
in
the
commonwealth's
brief
doesn't
--
he
didn't
get
a
windfall.
he
didn't
get
any
review
in
state
court,
and
there's
also
of
course
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
the
law
has
not
changed
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
he
is
in
much
worse
position.
he
--
he
just
--
he
just
had
all
--
all
review
taken
away
in
the
state
courts
and--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--well,
there
are
certainly
other
things
that
the
state
can
do.
they
can
--
they
can
prosecute
him
criminally
for
escape.
there
is
administrative
confinement,
those
kinds
of
things.
but
there
is
really--
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
--well,
there
--
this
--
this
court
said
in
ortega-rodriguez
that
--
that
increasing
somebody's
sentence
by
a
number
of
years
based
on
escape
would
introduce
an
element
of
arbitrariness
and
irrationality,
and
--
and
certainly
changing
the
sentence
from
life
to
death
based
on
disrespect
to
the
courts
seems
like
a
fairly
--
a
fairly
serious
consequence.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
in
--
in
federal
court
if
it's
held,
as
we
argue,
that
the
state
court
rulings
were
not
adequate,
that's
true.
and
their
argument
is
he
should
be
executed
with
no
review
by
any
court.
i
do
want
to
return
for
a
minute
to
relaxed
waiver
because,
you
know,
the
primary
argument
that
i
heard
was
that
in
1984
at
the
time
of
the
escape
that
relaxed
waiver
wasn't
that
firmly
established.
that's
simply
not
true.
there
are
four
decisions
applying
relaxed
waiver
prior
to
1984,
and
those
decisions
held
that

who
affirmatively

a
constitutional
issue
--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
there

okay.
there
are
four
cases
and
in
every
case
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
gave
full
merits
review
to
all
issues,
even
issues
that
were
only
first
raised
at
oral
argument.
mr.
matthew
c.
lawry

mr.
matthew
c.
lawry
well,
there
--
there
is
a
question
about
whether
that
is
introducing
a
novel
rule.
but
--
but
i
was

in
the
comments
i
was
just
making,
i
was
principally
addressing
the
commonwealth's
argument
that
relaxed
waiver
wasn't
that
well
established
in
1984.
