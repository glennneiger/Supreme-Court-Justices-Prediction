justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
have
a
number
of
problems
with
the
third
circuit's
opinion,
but
the
question
presented,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
really
the
dispositive
point
of
the
opinion.
i
don't
think
the
question
you
presented
is
really
that
squarely
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
see
a
split,
either.
i
mean,
of
course,
there
is
going
to
be
some
discretion.
the
question
is
--
the
third
circuit,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
was
concerned
that
it
wasn't
firmly
established
at
the
time
of
the
waiver.
i
have
real
problems
with
whether
the
waiver
should
even
be
--
whether
the
time
of
the
waiver
is
controlling,
but
that
is
not
the
question
you
asked
us
to
resolve.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
know
why
you
submit
--
why
you
seem
to
concede
that
that
applies
here.
i
can
understand
why
we
want
to
look
at
the
time
of
the
waiver
if
it's
an
attorney
arguing
about
jury
instructions
and
so
forth,
but
the
man
escapes
when
the
door
is
open
or
when
the
window
is
open,
and
he
doesn't
give
consideration
to
these
things;
and
if
he
does,
i
think
that's
quite
irrelevant.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
waiver
point
is
--
is
something
that
shouldn't
be
conceded.
i
think
that
if
ten
years
elapse
between
the
time
of
the
escape
and
the
time
the
state
formulates
its
rules,
that
he
is
bound
by
those
rules
when
he
gets
there.
but
you
don't
argue
that.
that's
not
what
you
presented
to
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
not
what
the
third
--
third
circuit
was
saying.
it
was
saying
that
adequacy
of
the
rule
is
determined
by
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
waiver,
and
it
wasn't
well-established.
now,
i
have
real
problems
with
that
as
an
opening
premise,
but
that's
not
what
you
asked
us
to
resolve
in
your
petition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
insofar
as
the
ongoing
rule
is
concerned,
let's
assume
that
as
of
the
time
of
doctor,
which
was
a
third
circuit
case,
1996,
the
pennsylvania
rule
was
then
clear,
pennsylvania
for
the
first
time
having
made
its
rule
clear.
would
it
be
improper
to
apply
it
to
this
defendant,
because
he
escaped
before
doctor
made
it
clear?
i
--
i
just
don't
understand
why
the
general
rules
of
--
of
--
of
waiver
apply
in
this
case.
it
--
it
doesn't
affect
rational
conduct.
it
doesn't
trap
an
attorney.
why
can't
we
take
the
rule
as
it
was
when
we
heard
his
case
after
he
had
been
returned
as
a
fugitive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
i
--
do
i
take
it
that
--
that
justice
--
justice
breyer's
question,
repeated
by
justice
scalia
--
just
take
that
fact,
that's
the
only
question
before
us.
if
it
was
discretionary
and
it's
now
mandatory,
just
focus
on
that
only.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
your
client
isn't
hurt?
if
you
take--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
all
--
all
those
books
on
our
wall
are
the
first
time
it's
ever
come
up.
i
mean,
that's
how
the
law
--
that's
how
the
law
is
made.
so
--
the
whole
point
of
the
adequate
independent
state
ground,
it
seems
to
me,
is
part
we
don't
want
to
affect
rational
conduct
retroactively
--
not
applicable
here.
two,
we
don't
want
to
have
the
state
court
use
this
as
a
subterfuge
or
a
device
to
avoid
a
federal
right.
i
don't
think
that's
applicable
here.
you
might
want
to
argue
about
that.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
it's
a
completely
new
rule
in
the
case
of
an
escape
may
mean
it
is
still
an
adequate
ground.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
those
weren't
escape
cases.
were
they
all
escape
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
point.
why
isn't
escape
sui
generis,
and
how
can
we
ever
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
you
still
answering
the
chief
justice's
--
i
had
--
had
one
more.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
you
said
there
was
no
post-conviction
review.
i
--
i
thought
they
in
this
case
went
on
to
ask
--
to
exercise
a
limited
review.
they
didn't
reach
the
mills
v.
maryland
point,
but
they
did
give
a
limited
review
to
determine
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
whether
the
death
penalty
was
a
product
of
passion
or
prejudice,
whether
the
evidence
fails
to
support
the
finding
of
the
aggravating
circumstance,
whether
the
sentence
was
extensive
or
proportional.
they
did
give
post--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--conviction
review
on
all
those
points.
