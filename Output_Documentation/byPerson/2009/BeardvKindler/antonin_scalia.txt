justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
i
mean,
why
do
we
have
to
guess
about
it?
where
--
where
do
you
find
that
in
its
opinion?
because
i
have
--
i
have
the
same
--
the
same
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be,
but
where
--
where
do
you
get
that
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
here?
i
find
it
very
easy
to
get
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
the
proposition
that
if
there
is
discretion,
it's
not
a
firmly
established
rule.
where
do
you
get
your
theory,
that
they
had
changed
it
from
a
discretionary
rule
to
a
mandatory
rule
at
the
time
that
the
state
court
made
this
ruling?
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
--
that's
a
different
issue.
now,
your
--
your
assertion
is
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
based
on
--
decision
was
--
was
not
this
that
you
are
arguing
now,
but
rather,
it
was
based
on
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
change
in
the
law
from
discretionary
to
mandatory.
i
can't
find
that,
frankly,
in
the
opinion,
except
in
its
reference
to
doctor,
so
i
have
got
to
go
back
and
read
doctor
and
guess
that
that's
what
they
meant
when
they
referred
to
doctor.
but
assuming
it's
true,
justice
breyer
says,
even
if
it
is
true,
what
difference
does
it
make?
because,
even
if
they
had
changed
from
a
discretionary
to
a
mandatory,
the
trial
court
in
the
state
had
not
realized
that
they
had
changed
and
gave
him
the
discretionary.
so
what
--
what
complaint
do
you
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
the
new
rule
was
applied
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
point
is
the
new
rule
wasn't
applied
to
him.
the
trial
court
thought
that
it
had
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
clear
from
the
trial
court's
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
concluded
that
was
ridiculous,
so
they
stopped
doing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
or
after
his
execution?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
please--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
do
you
pick
1984
as
the
time
of
the
escape?
whether
it's
an
adequate
or
independent
state
ground,
whether
it's
been
consistently
applied,
it
seemed
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me
you
should
look
to
the
time
at
which
the
state
rule
is
applied.
now,
as
of
1984
i
suppose
there
are
some
notice
requirements
that
you
can
say
due
process
requires,
but
i
don't
know
why
the
adequacy
of
the
state
ground,
whether
it's
consistently
applied,
should
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
what
was
the
law
in
1984,
rather
than
what
was
the
state
law
at
the
time
they
applied
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
about
his
--
his
colleague
who
broke
out
with
him?
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
explain
that.
