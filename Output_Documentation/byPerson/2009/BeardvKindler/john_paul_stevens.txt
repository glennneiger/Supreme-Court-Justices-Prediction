justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
before
your
time
is
gone?
has
there
ever
been
a
precedent
in
pennsylvania
where
they
have
applied
the
procedural
default
rule
against
a
capital
defendant
who
--
who
was
guilty
of
flight?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wasn't
there
--
wasn't
there
a
general
rule
that
capital
defendants
always
get
one
shot
at
their
constitutional
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
were
there
pennsylvania
cases
in
which
they
had
prevented
a
capital
defendant
from
raising
a
federal
constitutional
issue
for
the
first
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
other
rules?
in
capital
cases,
had
they
applied
other
procedural
default
rules
at
--
for
the
first
time
a
capital
defendant
sought
to
raise
a
constitutional
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
how
can
you
have
a
firmly
established
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
question?
we
have
all
been
somewhat
trouble
because
some
ambiguity
in
the
opinion
below.
what
if
we
--
i
think
your
opponent
answered
this
question.
what
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
answer
to
the
question
presented,
in
italics
in
your
brief
is
no?
and
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
tell
them
whether
they
--
that
would
change
their
decision
or
not.
would
you
agree
that
were
a
proper
disposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
guidance
you
have
asked
us
to
give
is
whether
there
is
this
automatic
rule.
and
if
you
say
there
isn't,
doesn't
that
give
guidance?
and
the
answer
--
wouldn't
that
--
that
answer
the
question
on
which
there
is
a
conflict
among
the
circuits?
