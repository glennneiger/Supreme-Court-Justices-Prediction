justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
circuit
court
did
things
in
an
unusual
order.
instead
of
reaching
the
statutory
question,
it
reached
the
constitutional
question,
in
par,
because
it
viewed
the
two
as
intertwined.
why
isn't
its
judgment
that
there's
a
statutory
violation
what's
at
issue
before
us,
because
that's
what
they
said?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
it's
an
award
that
is
contrary
to
the
act.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
i
saw
it
in
their
brief
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
analyzed
the
requirements
of
the
act
and
of
circular
one
and
said
the
board's
ruling
is
not
based
on
those.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
true
generally,
but
if
the
board
believes
that
as
a
matter
of
law
it
can't
hear
this
dispute
and
consider
normal
grounds
for
excusing
a
failure
to
include
something
in
the
record
because,
in
its
own
language,
we
can't
do
it,
the
law
doesn't
permit
us
to
do
it,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
matters
outside
the
record,
we
don't
apply
normal
rules
of
waiver
or
forfeiture
or
any
of
the
other
rules
that
attend
themselves
to
a
failure
of
a
party
to
immediately
raise
a
defense
like
you
could
have
done
and
waited
two
and
a
half
years
to
do,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
board
is
not
reaching
--
merely
resting
its
decision
on
a
merely
procedural
rule,
it's
resting
its
decision
on
its
erroneous
view
that
the
law
deprives
it
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
but
that
--
this
is
not
merely
a
question
of
law.
this
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction:
is
it
entitled
to
hear
a
dispute
by
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
don't
you
think
there
is
a
big
difference
between
the
adjudicator
saying:
i
could,
but
i
choose
not
to
because
there
is
no
reason
for
your
failure,
from:
i
won't
because
i
can't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
those
are
--
those
are
two
very
different
concepts.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
--
can
we
--
i'm
sorry.
let's
assume
that
in
a
published
opinion
there
are
two
procedural
defaults.
one,
the
union
does;
the
other,
the
railroad
does.
the
board
says,
you
know,
i
am
resolving
this
dispute.
i'm
not
forgiving
the
union's
procedural
default,
but
i
will
forgive
the
railroad's
procedural
default,
because
they're
an
important
lifeline
business
for
america
and
we've
got
to
make
sure
that
they're
protected
at
all
costs,
and
union
members
are
just
not
important
enough
to
that
scheme.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
your
theory,
there
is
no
due
process
violation
in
that
case?
they
have
heard
the
arguments,
they
have
given
you
a
full
opportunity
to
make
your
point
about
the
procedural
default.
they
are
announcing
a
new
rule.
it's
okay.
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
what
theory?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
point
me
to
any
rule,
that
--
you
know,
anybody
could
point
to
a
rule
and
says
it
commands
a
result.
they
--
there
are
rules
here
that
say
disputes
should
be
submitted
to
the
board
and
resolved.
and
they
are
resolving
the
dispute,
the
dispute,
and
they
are
saying,
you
have
defaulted,
you
didn't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
can
do
that.
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
circuit
said.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
could
have
passed
a
rule
that
told
people,
warned
them,
and
said
this
is
a
procedural
rule
we
are
going
to
apply.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
what
point
does
the
interpretation
of
rules
that
don't
command
a
result
become
improper,
outside
the
board's
jurisdiction?
according
to
you,
never.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
is
a
difference
between
governmentally
ordered
arbitrations
and
private
contracts.
in
private
contracts
the
parties
negotiate
the
rules
and
they
set
them
forth,
and
the
arbitrators
then
follow--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
it
your
position
that
if
you
go
through
the
first
phase
and
as
everybody
is
walking
out
the
two
adversaries
in
the
first
investigative
space
say
this
is
never
going
to
be
settled,
this
is
the
most
important
case
in
the
history
of
this
--
the
railroad
system.
let's
go
take
it
to
the
board.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
they
can't
waive
the
grievance
procedure,
that
they
just
can't
go
straight
to
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we
disagree
with
you.
you
say
if
the
board
was
just
plain
wrong.
if
we
look
at
the
act
and
circular
one
and
say
we
can't
find
what
they
said
anywhere
in
there,
does
that
doom
your
argument?
have
they
asked
--
acted
outside,
has
the
board
acted
outside
its
jurisdiction?
