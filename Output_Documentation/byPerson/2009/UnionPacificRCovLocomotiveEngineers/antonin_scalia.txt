justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
that
provision
was
not
applicable
here
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
other
side
contest
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
promise
them
that
categorically.
there
were
certain
things
they
had
to
do,
right?
one
of
which
was
to
have
conferencing,
and
in
three
of
these
cases
they
didn't.
so
that
promise
didn't
extend
at
least
to
those
three
cases.
and
in
the
other
two,
where
there
was
conferencing,
the
act
also
provides,
as
any
sensible
act
would
have
to,
for
the
adoption
of
procedural
rules.
and
the
procedural
rule
here,
according
to
the
arbitrator,
required
the
submission
of
that
evidence
of
--
of
consultation
with
the
complaint,
which
didn't
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
--
do
you
say
that
all
five
were
--
were
conferenced?
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
do
anything
else?
what
do
they
do?
what
does
the
adjustment
board
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
get
you
in
trouble,
but
i'm
not
sure
they
do
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
that
could
possibly
be
true.
i
can't
imagine
being
an
arbitrator
and
not
being
able
to
say:
all
right,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
have
a
conference
next
tuesday.
i
want
you
to
have
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
papers
relevant
to
this
particular
point
that
we
are
going
to
discuss
in
by
two
days
before.
can't
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
not
know
how
to
run
an
arbitration
without
--
without
establishing
some
rules
of
procedure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
at
least
back
off
from
your
statement
that
an
arbitrator
cannot
set
rules
of
procedure.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
all
right.
that's
a
little
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
making
sense.
it
says
that,
or
it
just
doesn't
address
the
question
of
whether
they
have
to
be
included
in
the
original
submission?
i
mean,
i
assume
there
is
no
provision
that
says
--
or
i
missed
it,
there
is
no
provision
that
says
the
conferencing
materials
do
not
have
to
be
included
in
the
original
submission?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
he
did
have
rulemaking
power,
so
long
as
it
did
not
contradict--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
not
get
--
can
i
ask
about
argumentative
facts?
i
frankly
have
never
heard
of
a
phrase
like
argumentative
facts.
you
seem
to
think
it
means
only
those
facts
that
are
in
dispute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
be
a
pretty
incomprehensible
statement
of
the
--
of
the
event,
if
you
write
in
your
brief
statement
of
facts
and
you
only
write
down
the
facts
that
are
disputed
and
none
of
the
facts
that
are
agreed
to.
it
couldn't
possibly
mean
that.
i
would
think
that
argumentative
facts
simply
means
facts
relevant
to
the
argument,
and
one
of
the
facts
relevant
to
the
argument
is
whether
you
did
the
necessary
consultation.
but
i
don't
know
how
you
could
interpret
argumentative
facts
to
mean
only
those
facts
that
are
in
dispute.
what
kind
of
a
statement
of
facts
would
that
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
