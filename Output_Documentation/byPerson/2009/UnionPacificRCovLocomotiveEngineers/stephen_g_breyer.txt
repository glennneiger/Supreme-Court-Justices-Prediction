justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
same
argument
--
it's
the
same
argument,
as
if
you
had
an
apa
case,
and
the
words
in
the
apa
are
"arbitrary,
capricious,
abuse
of
discretion.
"
so
somebody
who
has
an
unfair
procedure
says
it
violates
those
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
really
see
that
it's
any
different,
except
we
normally
go
to
those
words
before
we
would
decide
a
due
process
question.
it's
the
similar
kind
of
question.
why
wouldn't
we
do
the
same
thing
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
--
could
you
go
back
for
a
minute?
i
mean,
this
reads
as
if
it's
very
complicated,
but
for
me,
i
read
the
afl-cio
brief
and
that's
what
i
am
thinking
of
and
it
seems
this
is
not
such
a
hard
case.
basically,
there
is
a
statute
filled
with
words
of
procedure,
and
it
isn't
too
difficult
to
interpret
that
statute
as
meaning
that
the
board
should
have
fair
procedure,
not
unfair
procedure.
now,
if
you
are
willing
to
make
that
giant
step,
the
remaining
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
procedure
here
was
fair
or
unfair.
and
the
seventh
circuit
is
filled
with
pages
of
opinion
that
explains
why
it
was
unfair.
and
the
reason
basically
it
was
unfair
is
because
no
one
in
his
right
mind
previous
to
this
case
would
have
thought
that
you
should
fill
up
your
brief
with
a
lot
of
facts
that
nobody's
going
to
contest.
and
after
this
case,
the
board
said:
by
the
way,
you
have
to
put
in
a
whole
lot
of
jurisdictional
facts
even
if
nobody
is
going
to
contest
them,
and
since
you
didn't
do
it,
you
are
out,
and
we
won't
even
give
you
a
chance
to
do
it
now.
okay?
so
i
read
that.
i
thought,
is
there
something
wrong
with
that?
and
then
i
thought
i'd
ask
you,
because
you
would
know.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
must
be
what
they
think
of
as
an
interpretation
of
the
rule
and
the
statute
that
they
already
had
promulgated.
the
rule
and
the
statutes
say,
the
rule
says
you
have
to
include
all
known
relevant
argumentative
facts.
so
if
the
circular
says
we
mean
it,
we
mean
the
facts
that
people
are
having
an
argument
about.
and
then
the
statute
says,
a
full
statement
of
the
facts
bearing
upon
the
dispute.
and
the
circular
and
then
this
document
say
we
mean
a
full
statement
of
facts
that
somebody
might
think
have
something
to
do
with
an
argument
that
people
are
having.
and,
so,
only
after
this
case
did
the
board
say,
oh,
no,
you
have
to
include
some
disputes
that
nobody
is
disputing,
some
facts
that
nobody
has
ever
disputed
or
seems
to.
now,
what's
--
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
right
in
stating
what
they
did?
is
my
statement
of
what
they
did,
which
was
meant
to
be
as
pejorative
as
i
could
possibly
make
it--
[laughter]
--and
you
are
going
to
say,
that's
right,
that's
the
correct
statement
of
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
your
point
is
that
there
is
a
rule?
it's
called
29
cfr
301.7(b).
if
that
rule
happened
to
say,
you
must
show
up
by
11,
that
would
be
a
fair
inference
you
don't
have
to
show
up
by
10.
and
that
rule
says
you
have
to
submit
the
argumentative
facts,
so
there
is
a
fair
inference
you
don't
have
to
submit
the
facts
that
are
not
argumentative.
i
take
it
that
that
--
suppose
--
suppose
that
you
are
wrong
on
that.
i
think
maybe
you
are
right,
but
suppose
you
are
wrong.
suppose
they
have
loads
of
authority
to
make
rules.
again,
you
have
a
strong
argument
they
don't,
but
suppose
they
did.
in
your
research
--
and
the
same
question
is
really
addressed
to
your
fellow
counsel.
in
your
research
on
this,
did
you
find
any
instance
in
which
either
a
court
or
an
agency
does
change
a
rule,
and
says:
now
you
have
to
say
the
date
right
underneath
the
caption,
whereas
previously
it
was
stamped
by
the
clerk.
okay?
they
changed
the
rule.
and
they
have
every
good
reason
in
the
world
for
doing
it.
and
then
they
apply
it
to
the
case
in
front
of
them,
which
didn't
know
about
it,
and
then
they
won't
let
them
change
it.
now,
is
there
any
case
at
all
which
said
that
that
was
lawful?
i
can
think
of
lots
of
cases
that
say
you
cannot
apply
rules
retroactively
where
it
is
unfair
to
do
it,
even
if
you
had
have
all
the
power
in
the
world
to
make
the
rules.
i
have
lots
of
cases
like
that.
what
i
wondered
is
if
anybody
found
a
case
along
the
lines
that
i
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
because
--
i
mean,
in
the
normal--
