justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
--
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
how
the
panels
--
how
these
panels
--
how
the
board,
in
your
view,
is
supposed
to
go
about
making
some
sort
of
sensible
procedural
rules
about
establishing
the
that
conferencing
took
place.
they
can't
do
it
by
rulemaking,
and
you
seem
to
argue
that
they
can't
do
it
by
adjudication,
so
what
--
they
can't
do
it
at
all?
there
--
this
is
just
going
to
be
chaos,
that
there
is
no
way
to
establish
a
regular
procedure
to
establish
that
there
was
conferencing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
they
--
could
they
adopt
a
rule
that
says
that,
if
the
--
if
the
parties
go
through
--
do
everything
that
is
necessary
prior
to
the
time
of
the
adjudication,
they
can't
pop
up
at
the
very
last
minute
and
send
in
a
letter
saying:
oh.
by
the
way,
there
was
no
conferencing;
could
they
adopt
a
rule
like
that
because
it's
just
a
big
waste
of
everybody's
time
to
leave
it
to
--
to
the
last
minute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does
the
government
party
define--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--how
does
the
party
filing
the
grievance
know
exactly
which
facts
are
in
dispute
at
the
time
when
they
made
the
submission?
here,
there's
a
dispute
about
whether
there
was
a
dispute
about
conferencing.
