justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
to
be
--
do
you
--
do
you
contest
the
question
of
whether
there
was
conferencing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
conceded
that
there
was
conferencing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
answers
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
--
is
there
any
rule
describing
how
one
has
to
get
this
into
the
record?
it's
just
--
how
--
what
would
have
been
the
proper
way
to
prove
that
conferencing
occurred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
refer
to
conferencing,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
implicitly
includes
con
--
not
expressly
includes
conferencing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
i
may
have
an
incorrect
impression
about
it.
is
the
--
the
thing
that's
at
issue
is
whether
or
not
conferencing
occurred.
is
it
also
important
to
know
what
happened
at
the
conferencing?
you
may
not
know
this.
is
the
--
is
there
some
sort
of
--
of
factual
description
of
the
negotiations
that
took
place
during
conferencing
an
important
part
of
the
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
only
--
the
only
importance
is
to
just
to
establish
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
if
i
may:
your
opponent
says
there
is
sort
of
a
common-law
adjudication
method
of
developing
new
rules.
and
that
there
is
precedent
out
there
for
dismissing
these
arbitrations
because
the
conferencing
was
not
established
in
the
record
at
the
time
the
proceeding
started.
is
this
a
reference
to
the
--
to
precedent,
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
were
there
presidents
that
might
well
have
put
you
on
notice
that
you
better
get
this
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
really
not
my
--
but
you
do
concede,
do
you,
that
there
are
half
a
dozen
cases
out
there
which
were
dismissed
because
there
was
the
failure
of
the
record
to
show
that
there
was
conferencing
below?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
--
your
objection
is
--
is
two-fold.
one,
that
you
think
the
requirement
that
the
record
show
it
affirmatively
is
not
supported.
and
secondly,
there
--
you
should
have
had
an
independent
right
to
--
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
that
would
have
cured
the
defect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
some
questions
about
the
common
law
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
also
cases
out
there
in
which
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
whether
there
was
conferencing,
but
nevertheless,
the
merits
were
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
least
six
--
six
or
are
there
more
than
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
any
of
those
decisions
that
were
boardwise
or
did
they
apply
to
one
panel?
