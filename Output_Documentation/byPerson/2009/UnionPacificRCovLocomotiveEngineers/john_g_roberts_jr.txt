chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-604,
union
pacific
railroad
v.
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
and
trainmen.
mr.
ballenger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
geoghegan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"gae-gunn".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
have
rules
like
that
--
we
have
rules
like
that
all
the
time.
no
matter
how
clear
it
is
what
happened
below,
if
it
wasn't
included
in
the
question
presented,
we
say
you
can't
raise
it.
this
is
just
a
rule
like
that.
they
have
a
rule
saying
this
is
what
you
have
to
do,
you
have
got
to
put
the
evidence
of
conferencing
in
--
in
the
record
at
a
particular
time.
you
didn't
do
it,
so
we
are
not
going
to
--
the
fact
that
on
the
facts,
on
the
real
facts,
it
occurred
is
not
an
adequate
challenge
to
the
procedural
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
there
is
now?
in
other
words,
this
is
--
rulemaking
by
adjudication
is
not
unheard
of.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
it
--
is
--
where
is
the
rule
that
there
has
to
be
conferencing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
--
you
think
that
was
where
the
board
erred,
in
requiring
conferencing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
--
can
the
board
adopt
procedures
about
how
you
go
about
proving
conferencing?
you
say
there
is
no
rule
because
there
wasn't
a
rule
adopted
in
1934.
there
is
a
rule
that
there
has
to
be
conferencing.
does
that
mean
that
at
any
point
in
time
you
can
just
pop
up
and
say,
oh,
by
the
way,
there
was
conferencing?
or
can
the
board
say,
this
is
how
you
go
about
establishing
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
can
--
the
board
can
never
have
a
rule
that
says,
you
have
to
establish
conferencing,
you
know,
before
the
date
of
the
first
arbitral
proceeding,
or
within
30
days?
the
fact
that
all
that
has
to
happen
under
the
act
is
that
there
be
conferencing,
you
are
free
to
establish
it
at
any
way
you
want,
at
any
time
you
want?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
does
it
say
the
unions
have
to
send
in
letters
requesting
a
conference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
could
the
board
--
could
the
board
adopt
a
rule
requiring
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
be
clear
--
i
will
take
you
off
the
hook.
[laughter]
just
to
be
clear,
you
say
it's
established
practice
that
the
railroads
normally
file
their
objection
at
a
--
you
know,
at
a
particular
point,
and
you
think
the
board
is
without
power
to
say:
look.
this
is
the
established
practice.
you,
railroad,
did
not
follow
it,
and
so
we're
not
going
to
consider
your
objections.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
you
mean
that
they
--
the
board
can't
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought,
under
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
the
arbitrators
has
broad
deference
to
adopt
these
sorts
of
modes
of
procedure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
we
would
review
only
for
whatever
it
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
review
--
the
review
of
government
arbitrators
arbitrating
provisions
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
standard
of
review
of
that
is
different
than
private
arbitrators
under
the
steelworkers
trilogy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
think
that
this
is
that.
i
mean,
if
you
say:
look.
here's
the
rule.
you
have
got
to
file
these
things
by
this
date,
that
is
not
imposing
your
own
rule
of
industrial
justice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
saying
that,
if
the
board
adopts
a
procedure
exactly
like
that,
you
may
challenge
it
as
--
as
violating
due
process
because
you
didn't
have
notice,
any
number
of
things,
but
you
can't
say
that
the
board
is
imposing
its
own
brand
of
industrial
justice.
that
sort
of
seems,
to
me,
goes
to
the
merits
in
the
standards
of
arbitration,
rather
than
procedures
like
this,
unless
it's
a
procedure
like
was
hypothesized
earlier,
that
only
applies
to
one
side
and
not
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
presumably,
there
is
none
that
says
they
don't
have
to
be.
in
other
words,
i
take
it
that
this
is
an
issue
that
is
simply
not
addressed
by
the
cfr
rules?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
are
just
disputing
the
validity
or
applicability
of
the
rule.
you
don't
want
to
comply
with
the
rule.
i
mean,
is
it
any
different
than
saying:
look,
okay,
we've
got
this
arbitration
that
is
going
to
go
forward.
we
are
going
to
meet
at
10:00
monday
morning.
it
is
the
first
meeting.
one
side
doesn't
show
up
and
then
they
say,
well,
there's
no
rule
that
says
we
have
to
be
there
at
10:00
monday
morning;
that's
just
the
arbitrator
saying
that
to
--
to
move
the
procedure
along,
so
you
can't
penalize
us
in
any
way
for
not
showing
up
at
10:00
monday
morning.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
recall
the
situation
--
do
you
recall
the
situation
justice
breyer
described,
and
we
can
debate
about
it,
whether
it's
rulemaking
by
adjudication,
which
does
take
place,
you
would
say
that
in
the
situation
you
described,
it
violated
due
process,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
you
could
submit
that
offer
of
proof
at
any
time
during
the
proceeding
and
the
board
would
have
to
accept
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
wouldn't
the
other
side
say
we
don't
have
to
raise
the
objection
at
a
particular
time.
you
can't
make
a
rule
telling
us
we
have
to
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question
is
that
you
can
submit
that
offer
of
proof
at
any
time,
and
it
has
to
be
considered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
geoghegan.
mr.
ballenger,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may
answer
the
question,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
her
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-604,
union
pacific
railroad
versus
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers.
