justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
contest
it
in
two.
two
cases,
you
concede
that
there
was
in
fact
a
conference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
board
can
make
rules
of
procedure.
it
can't
make
rules
of
jurisdiction.
the
dismissal
of
all
these
petitions
was
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
now,
if
the
board
has
no
authority
to
set
its
jurisdiction
--
and
i
think
that's
plain;
congress
has
that
authority,
not
the
board
--
then
it
is
required
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
that
congress
gave
it.
so
why
isn't
that
the
very
first
question
that
this
court
should
deal
with?
the
board
threw
these
cases
out
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
whatever
the
failing
was,
it
was
not
and
could
not
be
jurisdictional
because
the
board
has
no
authority
to
describe
its
own
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
this
is
just
a
mistaken
use
of
words,
rather
than
--
than
the
board
saying,
under
our
rules,
we
don't
have
power
to
handle
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
--
do
you
dispute
what
your
opponent
tells
us,
that
some
panels
of
the
board,
even
when
there
has
been
no
conference,
let
alone
no
proof
of
a
conference,
but
some
panels
have
stayed
proceedings
to
allow
the
conference
to
occur,
and
then
the
board
will
pick
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
am
looking
at
the
decision
and
they
are
all
identical
in
this
respect.
the
board
said
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
any
of
the
remaining
procedural
or
substantive
issues
associated
with
this
claim.
"no
jurisdiction",
that
sounds
like
they
are
saying:
we
have
no
authority
to
consider
anything
about
this
case;
we
must
toss
it
out
because
there
is
no
proof
of
the
conference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
going
against
another
panel
that
says,
not
only
you
don't
have
to
have
the
proof,
even
if
you
didn't
have
the
conference
we
are
not
going
to
throw
you
out.
now,
there
is
different
panels,
but
it
is
the
same
board.
why
shouldn't
the
grievants
here
say,
we
don't
understand
this?
it's
conceded
there
was
a
conference,
at
least
in
two
of
the
cases.
our
buddies
didn't
even
have
a
conference
and
this
same
board,
a
different
panel,
allowed
them
to
cure
it.
and
i
can't
cure
it
now.
that
is
the
height
of
arbitrary
behavior
by
the
board,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
talking
about
due
process.
i'm
talking
about
conformity
with
the
act,
the
act's
requirement.
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
does
the
board
as
a
whole
apparently,
because
i
am
looking
at
the
instruction
about
joint
exhibits
and
it
tells
the
parties,
when
you
are
going
to
make
a
submission
don't
include
unnecessary
documents,
and
among
things
don't
include
things
that
aren't
in
dispute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--like
letters
requesting
conferences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
the
board
is
telling
people,
i
will
go
back
a
sentence:
"representatives
may
wish
to
omit
documents
that
are
unimportant
and/or
irrelevant
to
the
disposition
of
the
dispute.
"
i
mean
that
--
that
seems
to
me
is
trapping
people,
if
the
board
says,
please
don't
dump
on
us
unnecessary
paper.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
if
--
then
a
person
following
this
is
obliged
not
to
pay
heed
to
this
advice
because
if
you
don't
put
in
every
document,
if
you
don't
put
in
enough
evidence
of
conferencing,
you
are
going
to
be
out
and
never
have
your
grievance
heard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
are
not
relying
on
it
as
applicable
in
this
case.
they
are
relying
on
it
as
the
board's
indication
that
it's
sound
to
tell
the
parties,
don't
dump
on
us
unnecessary
paper.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some
panels
of
the
board.
other
panels
think
this
is
an
eminently
curable
defect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
decision
on
the
merits.
here
we
are
talking
about
a
threshold
barrier
to
even
get
your
case
heard.
and
that
is
being
decided
differently
by
different
panels.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
two
cases
you
concede
that
that
condition
was
met,
that
there
was
a
conference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
are
not
even
talking
about
a
conference
requirement.
we
are
talking
about
a
pleading
rule,
how
you
plead.
everybody
concedes
that
the
conference
occurred
in
two
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
how
you
plead
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said,
on
that
point
in
your
brief,
that,
normally,
the
carrier
will
raise
the
absence
of
conferencing
as
an
impediment
at
the
time
the
union
files
its
notice
of
intent
to
file
a
submission.
what
is
--
what
is
the
basis?
you
didn't
give
any
citation
for
that.
you
say,
ordinarily,
that's
what
the
--
the
carrier
will
--
would
do,
and
then
you
are
tipped
off,
and
then
you
put
in
your
evidence
about
conferencing.
what
--
what
makes
you
--
what
backs
up
this
statement
that,
normally,
carrier
raises
the
absence
of
conferencing
as
an
impediment
at
the
time
the
union
files
its
notice
of
intent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position
was
--
at
least
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
earlier,
that
these
individual
panels
do
not
have
rulemaking
authority
for
the
board.
i'm
looking
at
something
that
says,
"national
railway
adjustment
board,
uniform
rules
of
procedure,
revised
june
23rd.
"
that's
put
out
by
the
--
the
board,
the
one
that
you
said
that
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
thought
that
your
--
because
there's
nothing
in
this
statute,
nothing
in
any
regulation,
that
gives
an
individual
panel
the
right
to
proscribe
rules
of
procedure
that
all
parties
to
these
disputes
are
obliged
to
follow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
--
that
authority
is
vested
only
in
the
board,
not
in
the
panels.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
did
--
you
did
make
an
offer
of
proof
as
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
fact,
the
panel
invited
it
and
you
have
made
it;
and
then
the
panel
said
sorry,
it's
too
late,
you
have
to
do
it
at
the
time
you
make
your
initial
filing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
railway
labors
act's
provisions
for
resolution
of
disputes
between
railroads
employees
and
their
employers.
the
act
calls
for
initial
recourse
to
the
grievance
procedure
set
out
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract
between
the
employee's
union
and
the
the
carrier.
the
last
step
in
the
internal
process
is
a
conference,
a
final
effort
by
the
union
and
the
carrier
to
reach
a
settlement
agreeable
to
both
sides.
failing
settlement,
either
party
made
prompt
arbitration
by
notifying
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
a
34-member
board
composed
of
industry
and
labor
representatives
in
equal
numbers.
for
arbitration
the
board
sits
in
panels
that
include
two
members
representing
labor,
two
representing
industry
and
a
neutral
referee
to
break
ties.
at
issue
here
are
the
grievances
of
five
employees
of
the
union
pacific
railroad.
when
the
collective
bargaining
procedure
achieved
no
solution
the
union
initiated
board
arbitration.
a
board
panel
convened
to
hear
the
cases.
just
before
the
hearing
was
to
start,
one
of
the
two
industry
representatives
on
the
panel
raised
an
objection
the
carrier
itself
had
not
yet
urged.
the
record
submitted
by
the
union,
the
objecting
panel
member
observed,
contained
no
proof
of
conferencing.
the
union
maintained
that
conferences
had
in
fact
occurred
in
all
five
cases
and
it
offered
supporting
documents,
but
the
panel
held
that
the
proof
came
too
late.
absent
inclusion
of
proof
of
conferencing
in
the
union's
initial
submission
the
panel
ruled,
the
cases
had
to
be
dismissed
for
want
of
board
authority
to
assume
jurisdiction
over
the
employees'
claims.
the
union
sought
judicial
review
and
prevailed
in
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
that
court
explained
in
plain
english
that
the
controversy
reduced
to
a
single
question
is
written
documentation
that
union
and
carrier
representatives
have
had
conferred
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
board
arbitration.
the
seventh
circuit
answered
no,
but
it
placed
its
decision
on
the
extra
statutory
ground
that
the
panelâ€™s
dismissals
denied
the
grievened
employees
due
process.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
dismissal
orders
were
not
tenably
grounded,
but
to
reach
that
decision
there
was
no
cause
to
resort
to
due
process,
a
ground
for
upsetting
board
orders
not
stated
in
the
railway
labor
act.
the
act
does
provide
for
vacating
board
orders
not
confined
to
matters
within
the
scope
of
the
panel's
jurisdiction.
that
we
can
conclude
is
just
what
the
panel
did
here.
it
refused
to
adjudicate
the
five
cases
on
the
mistaken
view
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hear
them.
proof
of
conferencing,
our
opinion
explains,
is
a
claim
processing
rule,
essentially
a
pleading
instruction.
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
because
the
the
panel
plainly
had
authority
to
assume
jurisdiction
over
the
employees'
claims,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
setting
aside
the
panel's
orders,
but
we
do
so
under
the
express
terms
of
the
railway
labor
act
without
reaching
the
question
whether
the
final
decisions
maybe
set
aside
for
want
of
due
process.
the
opinion
which
aims
to
reduce
confusion
over
matters
properly
typed
jurisdictional
is
unanimous.
