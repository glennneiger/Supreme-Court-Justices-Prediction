mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
"gae-gunn",
actually.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
and
most
important
thing
that
the
respondent
would
like
to
stress
is
that
we
are
not
here
reviewing
an
arbitrator's
interpretation
of
the
contract
or
here
under
the
review
standards
set
by
steelworkers
trilogy.
we
never
received
an
interpretation
of
the
contract,
and
by
that
i
mean
the
contract
in
any
aspect
--
procedural
rules
of
the
contract,
substantive
rules
of
the
contract.
no
contract
interpretation
for
these
five
engineers.
and
the
reason
that
the
respondent
urged
both
a
statutory
and
due
process
violation
is
that
without
any
interpretation
of
the
contract,
these
five
cases
were
dismissed
invoking
circular
1,
code
of
federal
regulations,
as
the
basis,
and
denying
these
five
engineers
any
determination
of
their
contract
claims.
they
never
got
to
what
the
railway
labor
act
with
its
mandatory
arbitration
procedure
promised
the
engineers
and
the
carriers:
a
resolution
of
their
contract
claims
for
the
purpose
of
industrial
peace.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree.
these
cases
--
the
panel
never
said
that
the
three
cases
were
not
conferenced.
union
pacific
has
not
said
that
these
three
cases
were
not
conferenced.
the
panel
said
that,
no
matter
how
convincing
the
evidence
that
these
other
three
cases
were
conferenced,
that
all
five
cases
were
conferenced,
it
would
not
consider
that
evidence
because
it
was
not
attached
to
the
original
submission.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
oh,
absolutely.
we
have
correspondence--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--your
honor,
that
would
be
true
if
there
was
a
rule
that
required
these
documents
to
be
attached
to
the
original
submission.
there
is
no
such
rule.
301--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--rulemaking
by
adjudication
is
not
unheard
of,
your
honor.
but
this
is
not
rulemaking
by
adjudication
because
this
particular
panel,
which
is
an
arbitration
panel,
a
division,
it's
five
members,
it's
a
division
of
the
adjustment
board,
has
no
power
to
make
rules.
congress
in
section
(v)
of
section
153
of
the
act
delegated
the
rulemaking
power
under
this
act
on
a
one-time
basis.
in
fact,
it
put
in
the
dates.
it
had
to
start
in
june
1934
and
be
done
in
19
--
october
1934.
that
is
the
only
power
that
this
34-member
adjustment
board
has
to
make
rules.
a
panel
has
no
power
delegated
to
it
by
the
congress
under
this
act,
and
the
act
is
very
specific,
because
congress--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--the
rule
--
there
is
no
rule
that
there
has
to
be
conferencing.
there--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--it
is
in
section
152,
which
is
not
a
statute,
by
the
way,
that
the
nrab
administers.
we
are
not
disputing
that
we
have
to
prove
conferencing.
we're
happy
to
prove
it.
we
have
evidence
of
conferencing.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
we
believe
that,
given
there
are
no
rules
on
this
point
--
and
the
seventh
circuit
made
that
point
clear
--
that
what
has
been
to
be
done
is
to
facilitate
the
purpose
of
the
act,
which
is
to
get
a
contract
interpretation.
we
have--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--no,
you're
not.
your
honor,
you
are
not
free
to
establish
it
any
way
you
want.
you
have
to
have
relevant
evidence
that
the
conferences
occurred,
relevant
probative
evidence
that
it
is
not
prejudicial.
the
only
rule
that
has
been
cited
here
for
keeping
this
evidence
out
is
301.5,
and
that
is
at
page
50
--
62a.
and
it
is
the
rule
that
the
seventh
circuit
focused
on,
and
it
describes
what
should
be
in
the
original
submission.
and
it
says,
if
i
may
quote
part
of
it,
at
62a,
the
court
can
read
along
with
me:
that
"under
the
caption
"position
of
employees",
the
employees
must
clearly
and
briefly
set
forth
all
relevant
argumentative
facts,
including
all
documentary
evidence
submitted
in
exhibit
form
quoting
the
agreement
or
rules
involved,
if
any;
and
all
data
submitted
in
support
of
employees'
position,
must
affirmatively
show
the
same
to
have
been
presented
to
the
carrier
and
made
a
part
of
the
particular
question
in
dispute.
"
that
rule
is
referring
to
the
investigative
process
as
to
whether
--
for
example,
one
of
the
engineers
ran
a
red
light,
it's
alleged.
so
we
are
going
to
argue
about
that.
they
put
on
testimony.
we
have
witnesses.
there
is
cross-examination.
and
then
the
investigative
officer
makes
a
decision
about
whether
that's
going
to
be
put
in
the
record.
the
conference
is
an
informal
phone
call.
it's
not
specified
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
about
it.
but
it's
an
informal
phone
call
that
takes
place
after
the
whole
contract
grievance
procedure
has
been
exhausted,
and
then,
before,
it
can
be
30
seconds
--
you
know,
charlie
ridenour,
can
call
up
mr.
stone
and
say
--
you
know,
can
we
settle
this?
no.
we
can't.
okay.
that's
--
that's
a
conference.
that's
all
it
is,
and
what
has
to
happen
under
the
act
and,
unfortunately
--
and
it
is
unfortunate,
we
did
not
put
in
the
joint
appendix,
section
2,
part
6,
152,
part
6,
of
the
railway
labor
act,
which
describes
what
happens.
the
union
has
to
send
a
letter
requesting
a
conference.
i
hope
it
is
not
out
of
turn,
given
that
we
have
been
describing
evidence,
but
we've
got
letters
about
all
of
these
conferences,
saying,
we
want
to
have
a
conference.
once
that
happens,
that
triggers
a
process.
they
have
to
specify
--
both
sides
have
to
get
together
and
specify
a
meeting
take
place.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
oh,
it's
in
section
2
of
part
6
of
the
railway
labor
act.
we
did
not
cite
that.
it's
in
the
statute.
the
conferencing,
by
the
way,
is
in
section
2
of
the
railway
labor
act.
the
board
and
its
power
and
procedures
is
in
section
3.
section
3
has
no
mention
of
conferencing
whatsoever
in
it.
there
isn't
--
the
word
doesn't
appear
in
the
section
which
describes
what
the
board
is
supposed
to
do
or
the
board's
procedures.
and
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
cfrs
either.
the
cfr's
have
this
rule,
your
honor,
that
says
--
you
know,
trial
type
evidence
has
to
be
presented
at
this
investigative
hearing
below.
why?
because
it's
an
appellate
court
mand
you
don't
want
to
get
surprised
--
you
know,
the
union
can't
come
forward
in
this
case
and
say,
well,
we
have
a
surprise
witness
that
shows
mr.
smith
didn't
run
the
red
light.
i
mean,
that's
just
out
of
bounds.
it
surprises.
it's
blind-siding.
you
can't
do
it.
the
seventh
circuit
said:
wait
a
second.
this
rule
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
of
proof
of
whether
this
phone
call
occurred
after
the
whole
written
record
has
been
created
below.
there
are
no
rules
about
this,
and,
given
that
there
are
no
rules
--
and
given
that
the
union
--
and
the
panel
says
this
in
its
opinion
--
is
waving
before
the
panel
--
you
know,
mr.
neutral,
we
have
letters
--
you
know,
back
and
forth
between
the
parties
about
the
fact
that
conferences
occurred,
and
they
don't
dispute
that
two
of
them
occurred.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
your
honor,
that's
a
good
question.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
there
are
no
procedures
on
this
because
it
wasn't
--
it's
not
part
of
the
--
the
process
was
set
up
to
develop
the
trial
type
evidence
--
you
know,
whether
the
red
light
was
run
or
not.
it
wasn't
set
up
to
determine
how
conferencing
occurred,
and
it's
artificial
to
put
the
rulemaking
in
here.
the
seventh
circuit
said:
giving
--
given
the
how
and
why
of
it,
it
should
be
done
in
a
way
that
is
least
prejudicial
to
the
parties.
the
union
pacific
could
have
raised
this
issue
when
we
filed
the
notices.
they
didn't.
they
didn't
because
the--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--your
honor,
the
answer
is
past
practice.
although
this
is
not
a
collective
bargaining
situation,
we
are
not
applying
the
contractor.
that
was
the
past
practice.
that's
what
we
alleged.
this
case
was
to
show--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--the
adjustment
board
could
adopt
a
rule.
that
is
the
agency
--
and
it
still
exists.
it
has
got
offices
here
in
washington,
d.c.,
34
members.
they
were
given
this
explicit
rulemaking
power
by
congress.
they
were
delegated
with
the
authority.
if
there
is
an
agency
out
there
that
is
entitled
to
chevron
type
deference,
that
is
the
agency.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
i--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--no,
no,
your
honor.
our
--
our
position
is--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--we
don't
think
that
the
board
can
or
should
do
that.
what
we
do
think
is
that,
if
there
is
--
the
rule
that
i
just
read
from,
301.5,
says
that
you
raise
relevant
argumentative
facts.
union
pacific,
when
the
parties
exchanged
the
submissions,
did
not
say
that
there
wasn't
any
conferencing.
now,
their
--
their
comeback
to
that
in
the
reply
brief
was,
well,
we
didn't
know
you
had
not
conferenced
until
we
saw
that
you
didn't
have
any
evidence
of
it.
i
mean,
that's
just
not
--
slightly,
in
our
view,
disingenuous.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
your
honor,
in
our
view,
the
panel
couldn't,
but
the
adjustment
board
could,
and
the
adjustment
board
comes
out
with
these
little
procedures,
like
the
one
read
here
that
--
which
they
say
is
not
relevant,
that
says
--
you
know,
let's
have
these
joint
submissions,
let's
keep
evidence
of
conferencing
out.
they
are
trying
to
--
these
submissions
that
come
in
for
these
arbitration
cases
are
not
to
be
believed.
i
mean,
they
are
like
six
feet
high.
so
there
is
a
constant
effort
on
the
part
of
everybody
in
the
process
to
pare
down
the
submissions
to
what
is
actually
in
dispute.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
but,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--this
is
not
the
steelworkers
trilogy.
the
steelworkers
trilogy
is
about
private
arbitrators
determining
private
contracts
and
determining
the
procedures
under
private
contracts.
they
are
--
they
are
applying
the
procedural
rules
of
the
contract.
there
is
nothing
like
that
here.
we
are
here
because
a
government-funded
panel,
under
a
mandatory
procedure,
funded
by
the
government,
was
applying
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
not
rules
that
the
parties
agreed
to
themselves,
so
the
deference
that
is
given
to
--
by
this
court
to
a
private
arbitrator
applying
private
procedural
rules
that
the
parties
agree
to,
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
isn't
present
here
because
this
is
governmental
action.
it
is
a
governmental
agency.
now,
we
can
--
the
afl-cio
gets
into
an
argument
about
whether
it's
a
state
action.
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
these
are
arbitrators
paid
for
by
the
government.
the
arbitrators
are
selected
--
or
the
eligible
pool
is
selected
by
the
government.
they
are
applying
the
code
of
federal
regulations
to
keep
us
from
getting
to
any
procedural
rule
or
any
substantive
rule
under
a
private
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
looks
a
lot
like
governmental
action
blocking
the
people
from
getting
their
--
resolution
of
their
private
contractual
claims.
that's
why--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--it
should
be,
and,
in
the
hornbook
sense,
it
is,
the
reality
of
it
is,
and
that's
true
here.
we
can
say
it's
de
novo
review.
we
can
say
it's
a
different
standard
than
--
than
steelworkers
or
john
wiley,
and
this
is
not
a
john
wiley
case.
but
the
reality
is
you
aren't
going
to
get
a
court's
attention,
unless
they
did
something
that
is
actionable
under
the
steelworker
trilogy,
too.
and
the
steelworker
trilogy
has
the
enterprise
wheel
case,
which
says,
if
the
arbitrator
starts
making
up
rules
willy-nilly,
dispensing
"his
own
brand
of
industrial
justice.
"
not
drawing
their
essence
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or,
in
this
case,
the
cfrs.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
but
there
is
no
such
rule,
your
honor.
i
mean,
if
--
if
there
was,
we
would
be
in
a--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--your
honor,
all
i
can
say,
in
answer
to
that,
is
that
there
are
governmental
rules
that
have
very
specific
procedures
that
are
in
place.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
the
adjustment
board
down
the
street.
34
members.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
arguably,
in
the
board.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
well--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--your
honor,
that
didn't
happen
here.
if
i
may
explain,
there
is--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--the
whole
question
that
this
was
--
that
these
documents
were--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--i
--
well,
your
honor,
an
arbitrator
can
set
rules
of
procedure
within
the
parameters
of
what
is
allowed
by
the
act.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
but
the
act
itself,
and
the
cfrs,
are
very
clear
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
this
evidence
has
to
be
submitted
in
the
original
submission.
and
once
the--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--there
is
no
cfr
that
says
that
the
conferencing
materials
have
to
be
in
the
original
submission
or
the
case
is
dismissed.
there
is
nothing
like--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--well,
in
any
specific
way.
i
understand
your
honor's
point,
but
the
fact
of
it
is
that
the
record
that
you
attach
to
the
original
submission
is
only
about
the
relevant
argumentative
facts
that
are
in
dispute.
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
--
that
there
isn't
other
evidence
in
the
record
down
below.
what
happened
here,
and
this
is
different
from
all
the
other
cases,
is
that
the
union
came
in
and
said:
oh,
we've
got
evidence.
and
we've
got
evidence
that
relates
even
to
correspondence
between
the
parties.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
i
think
that
an
arbitrator
could
penalize
a
party
for
not
showing
up.
but
the
--
the
fact
of
this
is
that
there
is
no
authority
in
the
arbitrator
to
bar
evidence
of
conferencing
simply
because
it
wasn't
in
the
original
citation.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
we
did
not,
your
honor,
and
the
wells
case
in
particular,
where
there
was
no
question
that
the
rule
was
valid,
was
a
case
where
the
fourth
circuit
found
a
violation
of
due
process
because
the
parties
did
not
have
reasonable
notice,
or
the
carrier
in
that
case
did
not
have
reasonable
notice
that
it
was
the
postage
date
that
was
the
date
for
the
brief,
instead
of
the
postmark.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
i
would
say
that
it
is
also
in
excess
of
the
arbitrator's
power
under
the
act
because
this
arbitrator
does
not
have
rulemaking
power.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
your
honor,
you
were
asking
me
whether
he
could
require
the
parties
to
show
up
at
a
certain
time.
i
mean,
there
are
certain
rulings
that
are
in
the
case.
i
don't
want
to
get
hung
up
on
--
on
rules.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
well,
your
honor,
you
may
be
correct
in
your
view
of
it,
but
the
parties
have
interpreted
this
as
being
the
facts
that
are
in
dispute.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
and
remember,
this
is
a
procedure
that
is
not
about
conferencing
or
proving
conferencing,
it
is
a
procedure
that
--
about
what
happened
at
the
trial.
so
when
you
are
looking
at
that
301.5,
you
are
looking
at
a
rule
that
is
designed
to
make
clear
to
the
arbitrator
and
the
panel
what
it
is
that
is
being
disputed,
after
the
investigative
hearing
where
the
carrier
superintendent
signs
off
and
says,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
discharge
this
guy
because
he
ran
the
red
light.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
in
that
context,
it
is
not
about
conferencing
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
yes.
well,
that's
because
this
particular
rule
is
so
focused
on
what
happens
at
trial.
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
trial-type
procedures,
they
are
elaborate.
it
is
like
a
state
court
proceeding.
there
is
not
a
neutral
party.
there
is
a
carrier's
officer
behind
it.
but
you
have
union
representatives
who
are
better
than
most
lawyers,
i
must
say,
in
terms
of
putting
in
the
exhibits
and
evidentiary
record
and
cross-examination.
this
is
all
transcribed
elaborately
in
the
transcript,
so
that
it's
like
at
the
end
of
a
trial.
i
mean,
the
parties
know,
at
the
end
of
a
contested
criminal
or
civil
trial
that
may
go
on
for,
basically,
all
day,
what
the
facts
are
that
are
in
dispute.
but
at
any
rate,
this
is
the
regulation
that
was
created
in
1934,
and
it
was
not
about
proving
conference--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--your
honor,
this
isn't
a
system
of
precedent.
there
is
certainly
no
strict
stare
decisis
here.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
no,
your
honor,
not
in
or
our
view.
i
mean,
the
cases
they
cite
are
arbitration
awards
where
the
arbitrator
says,
looking
at
the
whole
record,
not
what
was
attached
to
the
original
submission
--
there
isn't
a
single
arbitration
award
that
says,
we
are
only
looking
at
the
original
submission
and
we
won't
look
at
any
other
evidence
that
might
have
been
in
the
record
below
and
you
want
to
add
now.
there
isn't
any
case
like
that.
so
--
but
there
are
only
a
handful
of
these
cases
that
they
cite
in
the
joint
appendix.
your
honor,
there
are
probably
60,000,
70,000
of
these
cases.
they
are
not
codified
online.
what
lawyer
--
what
lawyer
would
want
to
practice
law
in
a
system
where
the
procedural
rules
are
maybe
in
4
cases
out
of
80,000
that
are
not
codified--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--we
do
admit
that,
but
we
say
that
in
our
particular
case,
the
record
would
certainly
include
or
we
would
be
allowed
to
supplement
with
the
evidence
from
the--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--that's
correct
and
we
don't
know
of
any
case
that--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
wish
i
had
made
that
point
earlier.
i
mean,
they
--
they
--
originally
we
passionately
objected
to
this,
and
the
--
and
the
neutral
members
said,
oh,
fine,
you
know,
we
will
--
we
will
reconvene
for
--
we
will
reschedule
this
in
three
months,
come
back.
so
everybody
came
back
with
the
evidence.
union
pacific
came
back
with
what
--
i
mean,
they
found
out
that,
in
fact,
they
have
--
probably
two
of
these
cases
had
been
conferenced,
we
came
back
with
our
letters,
we
said
here
it
is,
and
--
and
the
neutral
member
said,
oh,
no,
you
don't
understand,
i
didn't
really
want
you
to
do
this.
so,
you
know,
why
--
why--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--we
think
of
it
as
relevant,
probative
evidence
as
to
conferencing
when
the
objection
had
not
been
raised
at
the
time
that
these
cases
were
conferenced,
at
the
time
that
this--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--your
honor,
i'm
afraid
there
is
such
a
rule,
and
that
is
301.5.
and
it
says
that
the
parties
have
to
raise
relevant
argumentative
facts
in
the
original
submission.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
only
has
to
be
in
the
original
submission,
but
there
was
only
one
submission
here,
and
they
did
not
raise
conferencing.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
well,
any
time
that
the
objection
is
raised.
if
--
if
it
is
not
done
in
a
way
that
prejudices
the
other
party,
the
answer
is
yes.
there
is
no
rule
that
prohibits
that.
and
the
purpose
of
the
act,
your
honor,
is
to
get
the
parties
to
have
contract
interpretations.
and
the
way
this
was
done
--
the
way
these
cases
were
dismissed
without
any
hearing
and
what
the
seventh
circuit
called
blind-siding
and
what
the
union
dissidents
said
was
gamesmanship
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
be
of
concern
of
this
court,
because
it
really
undermines
the
integrity
of
the
arbitration
process,
and
it's
very
important
to
keep
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
oh,
sure.
i
mean,
but
it--
mr.
thomas
h.
geoghegan
--i
don't
think
that
there
are
--
there
are
the
cases
that
we
cited
where
it
turned
out
there
wasn't
conferencing
and
the
arbitrator
said
go
back
and
conference.
i
mean,
you
can
step
outside
the
hall
and
do
it
in
30
seconds.
you
know,
it's
a
--
it's
a
statutory
procedure
that
is
not
really
part
of
this
proof
process
that
is
set
up
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
well,
my
time
is
up.
