mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
3
first
(q)
of
the
railway
labor
act
says
that
the
findings
in
an
order
of
the
division
shall
be
conclusive
on
the
parties,
except
that
the
order
of
the
division
may
be
set
aside
for
one
of
three
specified
reasons.
as
a
matter
of
plain
dictionary
meaning
in
this
context,
"except"
means
that
there
are
three
and
only
three
exceptions
to
the
otherwise
conclusive
nature
of
these
awards.
in
the
sheehan
case,
this
court
explains
that
the
dispositive
question
is
whether
the
parties'
objections
falls
within
one
of
the
three
reasons
specified
within
the
statute.
this
court
explained
that
the
statutory
language
means
just
what
it
says
and
that
a
contrary
conclusion
would
ignore
the
terms,
purposes--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--well,
your
honor,
it
certainly
would
be
this
court's
prerogative
and
appropriate
for
this
court
to
choose
to
reach
the
statutory
ground
first,
but
we
think
that
the
respondents
have
no
viable
claim
under
the
statute,
and
so
then--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--their
only
claim
under
the
statute
is
under
the
second
statutory
ground
of
review
for
an
award
that
fails
to
confine
or
conform
itself
to
the
board's
jurisdiction.
an
arbitrator's
jurisdiction--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--but,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--they
--
they
have
never
made
that
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
your
honor,
on
--
on
page
5
of
their
brief
to
the
seventh
circuit,
they
waived
any
argument
based
on
that
first
statutory
ground
of
review.
there
was
a
first
count
in
their
petition
for
review
that
was
based
on
that
statutory
ground,
and
on
page
5
they
renounced
it.
the
only--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--well,
if--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
an
important
difference.
the
first
ground
of
review
under
the
act
provides
review
for
violations
of
the
plain
terms
of
the
rla
itself.
the
second
ground
is
for
an
act
in
excess
of
jurisdiction,
which
the
lower
courts
have
correctly
understood
to
be
a
reference
to
this
court's
steelworker
trilogy
standard
of
review
for
labor
arbitration
generally.
an
arbitrator's
jurisdiction
is
to
interpret
and
to
apply
the
parties'
agreement
and
the
relevant
arbitral
rules.
an
arbitrator
exceeds
his
jurisdiction
if
but
only
if,
under
this
court's
well-settled
case
law,
his
decision
isn't
even
arguably
construing
or
applying
the
relevant
principles,
and
this
decision
clearly
satisfies
that
standard,
your
honor.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
board's
decision
in
this
case,
and
one
of
the
five
appears
at
pages
65
--
65a
to
72a
of
the
petition
appendix.
the
relevant
reasoning
starts
on
68a
to
71a.
the
award
contain
five
pages
of
careful
reasoning
by
the
board.
the
board
says
that,
quote:
"we
carefully
studied
the
arbitral
and
judicial
precedents
cited
by
both
parties
in
support
of
their
respective
positions.
"
and
that
"an
evidentiary
process
after
the
appeal
to
this
board
would
have
been
contrary
to
the
procedural
requirements
contained
in
circular
1,
as
well
as
the
weight
of
arbitral
precedents
supporting
the
carrier's
position.
"
well,
what
are
those
requirements?
section
301.2(b)
of
circular
1
expressly
says
that,
quote:
"no
petition
shall
be
considered
by
any
division
of
the
board
unless
the
subject
matter
has
been
handled
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
"
which
includes
the
statutory
requirement
that
a
conference
must
have
occurred.
the
board
has
reasonably
understood
that--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--it's
a
complex
question,
your
honor.
in
the
arbitration,
union
pacific
went
--
when
this
issue
came
up,
union
pacific
went
back
to
its
records
and
determined
that
it
had
proof
in
its
own
records
that
two
of
the
five
cases
had
been
conferenced.
and
so
we
essentially
conceded
that
point
in
the
arbitration.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
we
didn't
contest
that
point
in
the
arbitration.
of
course,
the
arbitrators
correctly
determined
that
it
was
irrelevant.
as
to
the
other
three,
the
--
union
pacific
did
not
have
in
its
files
the
paperwork
that
it
would
expect
to
see
there
if
conferences
occurred.
so--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--well,
we
took
the
position
in
the
arbitration
that
we
don't
know
for
sure
whether
conferencing
occurred
and
that
it's
respondent's
burden
to
prove
it,
and
that
the
proof
that
they
proffered
in
the
arbitration
was
not
convincing
and
sufficient
to
satisfy
their
burden.
we
think
that
constitutes
contesting
the
issue
in
an
ordinary
legal
sense.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
in
two
cases,
that
appears
to
be
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but,
of
course,
the
board
properly
determined
within
its
discretion
that
that
fact
is
not
relevant
because
the
board
enforced
its
procedural
rule
that
the
evidence
of
conferencing--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--but
your
honor,
the
board
was
--
i
think
the
board
is
entitled
to
mean
different
things
by
the
word
3
court
would
mean.
this
court
often
means
many
different
things
when
it
uses
that
word.
what
the
board
held
was
that
the
--
under
the
language
of
circular
1
and
the
weight
of
arbitral
precedent
the
board
cannot
consider
information
that
is
not
included
in
the
parties'
initial
submissions.
the
board
has
understood
for
a
very
long
time,
consistent
with
the
language
of
circular
1,
like
section
301.2(a),
that
it
is
an
appellate
body
that
makes
decisions
on
the
basis
of
a
record
that
is
before
it,
that
was
organized
on
property
and
presented
by
the
parties
in
their
initial
submissions.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
the
substance
--
i
think
it
can
--
you
can
get
tied
up
in
the
word
"jurisdiction"
in
a
way
that
makes
it
more
confusing
than
it
needs
to
be.
what
the
board
held
was
that
the
confluence
of
the
procedural
rules,
specific
procedural
rules,
in
circular
1
established
two
propositions:
first,
that
the
board
cannot
consider
a
matter
unless
conferencing
in
fact
occurred;
and
second,
that
the
only
evidence
that
the
board
is
ever
allowed
to
look
at
under
its
own
procedural
rules
is
the
evidence
that
is
in
the
initial
submissions.
if
you
put--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--that
--
we
don't
contest
that,
justice
ginsburg.
but,
of
course,
this
isn't
ordinary
agency
adjudication
of
the
sort
conducted
under
the
apa,
where
the
board
has
to
stand
behind
as
an
entity
every
decision
that
is
made
by
any
panel.
this
is
a
peculiar
sort
of
agency-supervised
arbitration,
and
it's
perfectly
appropriate
in
this
context
for
two
simultaneous
panels
of
the
board
to
reach
different
interpretations
of
the
same
language.
and
a
court
really--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
this
court
squarely
rejected
in
the
sheehan
case
itself
the
suggestion
that
there
is
independent
judicial
review
just
because
a
question
of
law
is
at
stake.
that
was
the--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--there
is
no
question,
no
one
has
ever
disputed
in
this
case,
that
the
board
was
entitled
to
hear
this
matter.
for
instance,
the
question
of
arbitral
jurisdiction,
no
one
has
ever
disputed
that
this
court
--
that
this
dispute
was
properly
before
the
board.
the
board
resolved
it.
the
board
simply
resolved
it
on
procedural
grounds.
and
the
explanation
that
it
gave
was
that
considering
material
outside
of
the
initial
submissions
would
be
contrary
to
circular
1
and
to
the
weight
of
arbitral
precedent
directly
on
the
point.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
again,
your
honor,
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
the
board
is
not
required
to
use
the
word
"jurisdiction"
in
precisely
this
sense.
there
is
no
question
that
the
board
has
jurisdiction
over
this
dispute.
it
is
a
minor
grievance
under
the
railway
labor
act
within
the--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--yes.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
they're
--
they
certainly
are
in
an
article
3
court,
your
honor.
but
this
court
has
said
many,
many
times
that
the
word
"jurisdiction"
is
a
word
of
many
meanings,
too
many
meanings.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
i
think
that
there
are
several
things
wrong
with
it,
your
honor,
starting
from
the
premise
that
the
statute
guarantees
in
all
instances
procedures
that
are,
quote
unquote,
"fair"
in
an
untethered
sense.
this
statute
guarantees
specific
procedural
rights,
which
if
you
put
them
together
do
guarantee
fair
procedures.
but
it
doesn't
guarantee
fairness
in
the
abstract.
so
what
you
have
to
look
at
are
whether
the
specific
procedures
that
are
guaranteed
by
the
statute
were
complied
with,
and
they
were.
now,
taking
a
step
back,
even
if
we
are
going
to
talk
about
what
is
fair
and
unfair,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
unfair
about
what
happened
here.
as
the
board
explained,
referencing
its
own
prior
precedents
and
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations
that
are
governing,
the
respondents
clearly
were
on
notice
that
they
had
to
do
this.
several
prior
decisions
of
the
board
had
dismissed
grievances
for
precisely
the
reason
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
conferencing
in
the
on-property
record.
that
is
if
you
look
at
page
40
of
the
joint
appendix
18679
from
the
first--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--as
the
board
has
explained
in
prior
cases,
the
ordinary
method
of
proving
that
conferencing
occurred
is
that
the
last
exchange
of
correspondence
on
the
property
between
the
carrier
and
the
union,
references
the
conference
that
had
occurred
and
what
happened.
and
then
both
parties
or
--
or
the
--
the
union
use
that
exchange
of
correspondence
to
--
in
their
initial
submissions
to
the
board
pursuant
to
section
301.2(a),
which
requires,
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
statute
itself,
that
every
submission
of
the
board
will
include,
quote,
"a
full
statement
of
the
facts
and
all
supporting
data
bearing
on
the
dispute.
"
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
a
full
statement
of
--
of
all
of
the
facts
and
supporting
data,
which
includes
conferencing.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
well,
that's
how
the
board
has
understood
it,
and,
of
course,
the
board
is
entitled
as
an
arbitral
body
to
interpret
its
own
rules.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
within
the
enormous
discretion
that
this
court
has
established
in
the
steelworkers
trilogy
standard
of
review,
which
is
that
as
long
as
the
arbitrator
is
even
arguably
construing
or
applying
the
appropriate
principles,
his
decision
has
to
stand.
there
is
no
real
question,
i
think,
if
you
look
at
the
five
pages
of
careful
reasoning
and
the
expressed
text
of
circular
1
here
that
this
--
this
is
an
exemplary
arbitral
award.
the
arbitrators
were
careful,
they
were
construing
and
applying
the
relevant
principles.
and
this
court
has
said--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--your
honor,
exactly
the
same
thing
happens
to
litigants
in
courts
all
of
the
time.
three
identically
situated
litigants
go
to
three
different
trial
courts
in
the
same
state
with
identical
claims
under
the
same
statute
and
they
present
those
claims
and
they
get
three
different
answers
from
the
state
trial
courts.
that
is
not
a
violation
of
due
process.
sometimes--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--your
honor,
it
is
a
feature
of
the
railway
labor
act
scheme
that
different
--
each
panel
of
the
board
is
its
own
discreet
interpretive
universe
and
is
to
be
judged
by
the
federal
courts
according
to
the
standards
set
up
in
the
statute.
it
will
happen
that
boards
--
that
panels
disagree
about
the
proper
resolution
of
an
issue.
that's
happened--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--three
things
about--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--three
things
about
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
that
instruction
sheet
doesn't
apply
here
at
all.
it
applies
only
when
the
parties
get
together
beforehand
and
agree
to
file
a
joint
--
a
joint
submission
to
the
board,
so
that
they
really
have
talked
about
what
is
in
dispute
and
what
isn't.
it
wasn't
even
promulgated
until
after
the
submissions
in
this
case
were
made.
and
it's
not
clear
how
the
board
is
going
to
understand
that
language.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
parties
can
omit
evidence
of
conferencing.
it
says
they
can
omit,
if
they
don't
dispute
it,
letters
requesting
a
conference.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
again,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
unique
or
new
about
what
the
board
did
here.
the
board
has
done
this
before.
now,
as
to
the
circular,
it
remains--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--no,
i'm
--
i'm
disagreeing
with
the
--
the
characterization
that
this
is
the
board
saying,
we're
going
to
make
up
a
new
rule
that
we've
never
applied
before.
that's
not
what
happened
here.
the
board
said
that
the
weight
of
arbitral
precedence
supports
the
carrier's
position.
now,
as
to
the
--
the
instruction
sheet,
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
the
board
is
going
to
interpret
that.
and
in
an
appropriate
case,
a
court,
if
they
interpret
it
in
a
manner
that
was
wholly
arbitrary
and
without
reason
and
would
violate
the
steelworkers
trilogy
arbitral
standard
of
review,
then
of--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--your
honor,
no
one
in
this
case
could
have
legitimately
relied
on
that
instruction
sheet,
whatever
it
means.
and
the
--
the
board
has
not
yet
construed
what
it's
going
to
mean.
but
it
doesn't
by
its
own
terms
apply
here,
because
a
joint
submission
was
not
made.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
your
honor,
in
an
appropriate
case,
if
a
board
panel
interpreted
that
language
in
--
in
a
manner
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
something
that
that
panel
then
did,
then
there
might
be
an
inherent
conflict
that--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--it's
not
applicable
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
it
--
it
only
applies
in
the
case
of
joint
submissions,
and
it
was
not
promulgated
until
after
the
submissions
here
were
filed.
so
no
one
could
legitimately
rely
on
that
instruction
sheet.
and
in
any
event--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--well,
the
board
obviously
does
not
consider
evidence
of
conferencing
unnecessary,
your
honor.
it
has
held
for
a
very
long
time,
going
back,
i
think,
40
years
to
award
18679
at
least,
that
evidence
of
conferencing
is
essential
to
the
board's
consideration
of
any
dispute
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
an
arbitral
decision
does
not
violate
the
steelworkers
standard
of
review
simply
because
other
arbitrators
disagree.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
your
honor,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
issues
of
procedural
arbitrability,
threshold
conditions
to
arbitration,
are
governed
by
the
same
standard
as
merits
issues
in
arbitration.
in
the
misco
case,
for
instance,
there
was
a
question
of
evidence,
and
the
arbitrator
refused
to
consider
certain
kinds
of
evidence.
and
this
court
said
questions
of
procedure
are
for
the
arbitrator.
in
john
wiley
v.
livingston,
which
is
in
many
ways
very
similar
to
this
case,
it
involved
a
procedural
precondition
to
arbitration
that
the
parties
have
to
meet
in
conference
prior
to
beginning
the
arbitration.
and
the
question
in
john
wiley
&
sons,
was
whether
that
precondition
of
conferencing
should
be
waived
on
the
grounds
that
on
the
facts
of
that
case
it
would
be
futile.
and
the
party
--
one
party
tried
to
get
a
court
to
intervene
on
that
question,
because
it
could
have
precluded
the
arbitration
entirely.
and
the
court
said
that
procedural
questions
arising
out
of
the
arbitration
and
bearing
on
its
disposition
are
for
the
arbitrator,
not
for
a
court.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
not
ordinarily,
justice
stevens.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
it
was
very
important
to
the
congressional
plan
and
so
it's
written
into
the
statute
that
the
parties
make
one
last
effort
to
settle
these
grievances
before
it
comes
to
the
board.
that
is
a
precondition
of
the
board's
consideration
of
any
grievance.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
your
honor--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--yes,
your
honor.
every
adjudicative
body
has
to
be
able
to
enforce
its
procedural
rules.
and
the
board
has
a
procedural--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--your
honor,
in
that--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--that
case
would
be
reviewable,
your
honor,
and
properly
so
under
the--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--statutory
ground
of
review
for
exceeding
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
because
in
that
case
the
arbitrator
is
not
even
arguably
construing
or
applying
the
rules;
he
is
dispensing
his
own
brand
of
industrial
justice,
as
this
court
said
in
the
enterprise
wheel
and
car
case.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
but
every
--
every
adjudicative
body
has
to
have
the
ability
to
set
and
enforce
procedural
rules
governing
its
procedures.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
in
the--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--well,
they
did,
your
honor.
they
have
sections
301.2(a)
and
(b),
which
if
you
put
them
together
give
at
least
fair
warning
of--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--under
the
--
under
the
steelworkers
standard
of
review
for
arbitral
decisions,
there
will
be
a
point
at
which
the
board's
interpretation
isn't
even
arguably
grounded
in
--
in
the
rules,
and
it
will
be
reviewable.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process,
which
is
what
we
are
here
talking
about
today,
there
probably
is
no
point
outside
of
the
substantive
interpretation
of
a
criminal
statute
where
that
kind
of
interstitial
gap-filling
or
interpretation
could
be
unfair.
it
happens
to
litigants
all
of
the
time
that
they
come
to
a
court
and
are
surprised
by
how
a
court
resolves
a
disputed
procedural
question.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
four
quick
points.
justice
stevens,
the
awards
that
you
are
looking
for
are
at
pages
40
and
45
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
also
we
would
suggest
that
you
look
at
first
division
award
23883,
which
is
easy
to
locate.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
all
these
decisions
are
rendered
by
one
panel.
the
board
never
sits
as
--
as
a
body.
the
respondent
suggests
that
the
steelworker
trilogy
standard
that
this
court
has
articulated
for
labor
arbitration
generally
doesn't
apply
under
the
rla.
there
is
no
authority
for
that,
that
many
i
am
aware
of.
the
lower
courts
have
understood
it
the
same
way,
and
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that's
correct.
congress
was
quite
clear
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
'66
amendment
that
it
anticipated
that
the
standard
of
review
under
this
statute
would
be
the
same
as
that
applied
in
ordinary
private
labor
arbitration.
and,
of
course,
the
sheehan
case
rejects
the
idea
that
there
is
some
kind
of
special
judicial
review
for
questions
of
law
under
the
rla.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
the
difference,
your
honor,
i
believe,
is
that
in
the
ordinary
arbitral
context
when
you
have
a
procedural
question,
the
question
is
what
the
parties
would
have
wanted.
here
the
question
is
what
congress
would
have
wanted,
but
there
is
no
--
about
the
correct
standards
of
review.
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
wanted
anything
other
than
what
the
parties
ordinarily
want
under
this
case
law,
which
is
for
procedural
questions
to
be
resolved
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
statute
in
section
2
second
requires
a
conference.
and
respondents
argued
initially
in
this
case
that
the
statute
shouldn't
be
read
that
way
and
there
should
be
an
exception
read
in
from
section
2
sixth.
that
was
rejected
by
the
district
court
and
they
chose
not
to
appeal
it
to
the
seventh
circuit.
it's
not
before
this
court.
now,
respondent
focuses
a
lot
on
section
301.5
in
its
language
about
argumentative
facts.
i
think
that
our
interpretation
here
today
of
that
language
isn't
ultimately
the
point.
that
this
is
a
question
for
the
arbitrators
to
resolve
unless
--
even
if
a
court
is
convinced
that
the
arbitrators
committed
serious
error.
but
the
more
important
maybe
threshold
point
is
that
the
arbitrators
didn't
say
that
they
were
resting
their
opinion
just
on
section
301.5.
they
never
invoked
section
301.5.
they
said
circular
one
and
the
weight
of
precedent
under
the
arbitration.
and
if
this
court
looks
at
section
301.2(a),
which
requires
the
parties
to
include
all
facts
relevant
to
the
dispute
in
their
initial
submissions,
i
think
that
resolves
the
question.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
relevant
standard
is
if
the
board
is
even
arguably
construing
or
applying
the
relevant
rules
and
its
decision
stands,
even
if
a
court
is
convinced
that
the
arbitrator
committed
serious
error.
