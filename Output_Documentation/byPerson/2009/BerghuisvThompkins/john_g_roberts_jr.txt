chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1470,
berghuis
v.
thompkins.
mr.
restuccia.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
question--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
question,
of
course,
is
not
whether
we
think
2
and
a
quarter
hours
under
all
the
circumstances
is
--
is
too
long
under
our
precedent.
the
question
is,
instead,
whether
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
state
court
to
determine
otherwise.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
saharsky.
ms.
jacobs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
happens
when
you
read
butler?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
have
it
to
the
extent
that
he
was
told
he
had
right
to
remain
silent
and
he
didn't
say,
i'm
not
going
to
talk
to
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
there
any
clearly
established
law
the
other
way,
which
is
the
pertinent
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
not
talking
--
we're
not
talking
about
the
fifth
amendment
right.
we're
talking
about
the
miranda
warnings.
there's
no
issue
of
voluntariness
in
this
case.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
suggestion
that
there's
--
that
the
statements
are
not
voluntary.
the
suggestion
is
that
they
may
have
violated
miranda.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
he
said,
do
you
want
to
remain
silent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
he
doesn't
answer
either
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
you
don't
have
to
invoke
your
rights,
but
butler
also
says
that
you
can
impliedly
waive
them.
you
don't
have
to
expressly
waive
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
so
the
question
under
aedpa
--
you
agree
there
can
be
an
implied
waiver;
that's
what
butler
says,
right?
so
the
question
under
aedpa
is
whether
the
state
court
was
unreasonable
to
determine
that
there
was
an
implied
waiver
on
these
facts?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
are
those?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
say:
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
it's
over.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
how
they
create
the
ambiguity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
this
gets
back
to
a
question
i
had
earlier.
i
thought
there
was
no
dispute
on
this
record
that
there
was
no
involuntariness.
we
are
talking
about
a
violation
of
the
technical,
important
but
formal,
miranda
requirements.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
person
says:
my
statements
were
involuntary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
correct
--
and
that's
where
--
how
i
read
butler;
you
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances.
and
you're
saying
no,
you
don't
look
at
any
circumstances;
they
have
got
to
ask
the
question
and
he
has
to
waive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
other
circumstances
are
irrelevant.
well
then,
if
yes,
why
are
you
talking
to
me
about
2
hours
15
minutes,
what
they
are
doing?
you
say
that
circumstances
don't
matter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case,
though.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
you've
lost
at
every
stage
on
the
voluntariness
and
have
not
renewed
that,
correct?
this
is
a
miranda
case;
it's
not
a
fifth
amendment
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one?
i
mean,
that's
--
i
don't
want
to
piggyback
off
justice
kennedy's
point,
but
that's
the
whole
point,
is
you
do
not
look
at
any
of
those
circumstances,
you
say.
before
they
can
say
anything
more,
they
have
to
get
a
waiver.
so
it's
30
seconds
if
they
go
on,
before
they
--
if
they
sit
there
for
how
long
before
--
how
long
do
they
have
to
ask,
do
you
want
to
waive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
--
could
you
describe
a
situation
where
you
think
there
would
be
an
implied
waiver?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
--
that
doesn't
sound
implied.
that
sounds
express
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
so
what
--
what
is
an
implied
waiver
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
now,
getting
back
to
ms.
saharsky's
point,
she
said
if
you
prevail,
you
have
to
overrule
butler.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
point
we're
at.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
there's
--
so,
there's
no
implied
waiver
with
respect
to
the
right
to
remain
silent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
restuccia,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
next
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
in
case
08-1470,
burghuis
versus
thompkins.
