wait.
do
--
do
we
have
any
case
that
says
that
2
and
a
quarter
hours
is
too
long?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
there
can't
be
a
waiver
after
2
and
a
quarter
hours?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
there's
no
clearly
established
supreme
court
law
that
2
and
a
quarter
hours
is
too
long.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
name
of
the
game
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
this
person
could
just
sit
there
for
2
hours
and
didn't
want
to
be
interrogated
and
doesn't
say:
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
answer
your
questions.
he
just
sits
there,
and
some
questions
he
doesn't
answer.
and
he
does
make
a
few
comments,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
have
a
rule
which
simply
says
if
you
don't
want
to
be
interrogated,
all
you
have
to
say
is
"i
don't
want
to
answer
your
questions?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
nice
and
clear,
wouldn't
be
any
problem
at
all.
that
was
never
said
here.
he,
in
fact,
submitted
to
having
these
questions
asked
of
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
the
police
have
to
play
this
game
of,
you
know,
an
hour
and
a
half,
2
hours,
2
hours
and
15
minutes,
5
hours,
7
hours?
why
don't
we
have
just
a
clear
rule:
you're
read
your
rights;
if
you
don't
want
to
be
questioned
all
you
have
to
say
is:
i
don't
want
to
be
questioned.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
difference
between
--
between
waiving
your
right
and
a
failure
to
assert
your
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
every
failure
to
assert
a
waiver?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
before
that?
what
is
happening
before
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
hasn't
asserted
his
right.
i
mean,
he
hasn't
said
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
has
done
neither.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
neither
waived
nor
asserted.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
saying
there
--
there's
a
difference,
i
--
i
assume,
between
not
waiving
and
positively
asserting
your
right
not
to
be
interrogated?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
--
if
he
had
--
here
he
simply
refused
to
sign
the
--
the
miranda
form,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
have
--
which
would
been
the
--
the
waiver.
and
--
and
you're
saying
it's
his
later
behavior
that
--
that
showed
that,
in
fact,
he
waived.
what
if
instead
of
just
refusing
to
sign,
he
had
said,
i
do
not
want
to
be
interrogated?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
he
has
the
right
to
terminate
the
whole
thing
by
asserting
his
right.
if
he
neither
asserts
the
right
nor
grants
the
waiver,
the
police
can
continue
to
try
to
obtain
a
statement
from
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless,
i
assume,
that
you
--
you
--
you
acknowledge
that
if
the
interrogation
had
go
on
--
had
gone
on
for
so
long
that
it
had
become
coercive,
then
that
--
that
--
that
last
statement
would
not
--
would
not
be
a
voluntary
waiver.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
--
what
you
need
to
make
"it",
it
depends
on
what
"it"
is.
if
--
if
you
mean
the
ultimate
confession,
i
think
i
don't
agree.
ultimately,
if
he
confesses
and
hasn't
been
coerced,
it's
voluntary.
but
if
by
the
"it"
you
mean
to
make
the
continuation
of
the
interrogation
voluntary,
that's
a
different
question.
and
i
don't
know
that
our
cases
establish
that
you
cannot
continue
the
interrogation
until
there
has
been
a
waiver.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
that
make
it
clear
that
--
that
there
has
to
be
a
waiver
before
the
interrogation
can
continue?
and
if
it
does,
how
does
it
square
with
butler?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
both
under
--
they're
both
under
miranda.
both
of
those
rights
are
miranda
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
read
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
had
him
read
a
portion
of
the
miranda
warning.
justice
antonin
scalia
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
they
had
him
read--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
i
--
boy,
i
--
what
more
do
you
need?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
he
--
he's
listening
when
--
when
they
read
it
to
him.
he
--
he
--
he
can
read
it
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
--
maybe
he
doesn't
want
to
talk
for
the
moment,
but
he
does
want
to
listen.
i'm
not
sure
you're
doing
defendants
a
great
--
a
great
favor.
i
mean,
some
of
them
might
want
to
listen
to
--
to
the
police
telling
them,
you
know,
by
the
way,
your
co-conspirator
is
singing
like
a
bird
and
he's
trying
to
pin
it
all
on
you,
and
maybe,
you
know,
if
--
if
you
don't
want
to
get
left
holding
the
bag,
maybe
you'd
better
to
talk
to
us
and
tell
us
what
really
happened.
i'm
not
sure
that
--
that
if
i
were
there,
even
if
i
didn't
want
to
talk
right
now,
i
might
still
want
to
listen,
which
is
apparently
what
this
--
what
this
person
did.
he
could
have
said,
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
talk.
and
it
--
and
it
would
have
ended.
that
would
have
been
an
assertion
of
his
right.
he
didn't
assert
his
right,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
--
he
sat
there
and
listened.
now,
maybe
he
wanted
to
find
out
what
the
police
would
have
to
say
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
those
facts
are
relevant
only
if
we
accept
your
--
your
principal
assertion,
which
is
that
you
--
you
don't
have
to
invoke
the
right
and
interrogation
must
cease
immediately.
if
we
agree
with
that,
then
all
of
these
facts
become
relevant.
but
if
we
think
that,
until
you
invoke
the
right,
the
police
can
continue
to
ask
you
questions
and
it's
up
to
you
to
answer
or
not,
then
those
facts
are
really
not
relevant
at
all,
are
they?
i
think
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
meant
to
be
a
trick
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
your
theory,
those
--
those
factual
things
are
irrelevant,
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--exactly,
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
i've
never
understood
that
to
be
the
law,
and
i
don't
think
it's
generally
understood
to
be
the
law,
that
unless
you
get
a
waiver
right
at
the
outset,
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
terminate
interrogation.
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
police
departments
that
don't
--
i've
never
understood
that
to
be
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
a
good
rule.
it
may
be
a
good
rule.
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
it
is
so
clearly
established
that
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
state
court
to
think
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
clear
rules.
your
rule
is
a
clear
one.
another
clear
one
would
be
just
the
opposite
of
yours;
that
is,
that
interrogation
can
continue
unless
he
asserts
his
right.
that's
another
clear
rule.
we
can
go
either
way,
and
it
will
be
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
doesn't
answer.
he
just
sits
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--impassively.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
they
have
to
stop?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
excuse
me.
a
waiver
of
what?
i
thought
the
chief
justice
was
talking
about
a
waiver
of
your
right
to
remain
silent.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wasn't
a
waiver--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
willing
to
talk
to
you,
i'm
willing
to
listen
to
you.
it
seems
to
me
you're
confusing
a
--
a
waiver
of
--
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
with
a
waiver
of
the
right
not
to
be
interrogated,
which
is
the
right
that
you
are
asserting
here,
a
right
not
to
be
interrogated,
unless
going
in
you
say,
i
waive
my
right
to
remain
silent.
that's
--
that's
the
new
right
that
you
are
asserting.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
right
not
to
be
interrogated.
