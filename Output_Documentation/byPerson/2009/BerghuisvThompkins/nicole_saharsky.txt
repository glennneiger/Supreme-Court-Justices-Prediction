ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent's
confession
was
properly
admitted
at
his
trial.
i'd
like
to
go
right
to
some
of
the
questions
that
this
court
had
about
the
language
that
was
used
in
the
miranda
decision
and
in
the
butler
decision.
both
--
all
of
this
language
comes
up
in
butler.
now,
butler
was
a
case
not
about
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
silence,
but
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel.
so
the
suspect
said
"i
will
talk
to
you",
but
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
said:
well,
we
don't
know
if
he
waived
his
right
to
counsel,
and
that's
why
the
court
got
into
a
question
of
implied
waiver.
so
the
court
in
its
analysis
in
butler
first
reviewed
this
language
that
the
court
has
talked
about
this
morning
from
miranda
that
says
"a
valid
waiver
will
not
be
presumed
simply
from
the
silence
of
the
accused
or
simply
from
the
fact
that
a
confession
was
in
fact
eventually
obtained.
"
and
this
is
our
understanding
of
that
language:
first,
it
is
not
the
case
that
a
failure
to
invoke
miranda
rights
will
be
taken
in
the
miranda
context
as
a
waiver.
now,
justice
scalia,
i
think
you
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
normal
rule
for
the
fifth
amendment
at
trial
is
that
you
assert
your
rights
or
they
are
waived.
but
miranda's
an
exception
to
that,
that
the
failure
to
assert
we
are
not
going
to
take
as
a
waiver.
the
government
has
to
do
something
more.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
as
long
as
the
warnings
are
given,
the
accused
has
been
told
of
his
rights,
and
that
the
police
will
respect
his
rights,
and
questioning
can
proceed.
the
court
said
in
davis
and
said
in
other
cases,
moran
versus
burbine,
that
the
primary
protection
afforded
by
miranda
is
to
level
the
playing
field
by
letting
the
accused
know
of
his
rights
and
that
the
police
will
respect
them.
and
after
the
point
that
he
gets
his
rights
and
understands
them,
the
police
can
question
him.
you'd
have
to
overrule
butler
to
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
waiver
before
any
questioning.
just
to
get
back
to
the
second
thing
that
the
court
said
in
miranda
that
was
picked
up
in
butler,
it
said:
we
are
not
going
to
assume
that
there
is
a
waiver
simply
from
the
fact
that
a
confession
was
eventually
obtained;
there
is
a
burden
on
the
government.
and
the
way
that
we
understand
that
is
that
the
government
can't
just
go
into
court
and
say:
look,
we
have
a
confession;
we
know
he
waived
his
rights.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
if
you
look
back
at
the
language
--
the
other
language
in
miranda,
it
says
that
a
waiver
is
a
prerequisite
to
the
admission
of
the
evidence
at
trial.
we
know
that
to
be
able
to
use
that
evidence
we
have
to
know
that
he
made
a
knowing
and
intelligent
and
voluntary
decision
to
talk.
but
that
he
--
that
doesn't
mean
he
has
to
make
the
decision
to
talk
right
away.
he
might
want
to
listen
to
what
the
police
have
to
say
about
the
benefits
of
cooperation
or
the
evidence
that
they
have
in
his
case.
and
that
--
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
the
police
could
say
that
could
be
understood
to
be
custodial
interrogation.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
what
i'm
saying
is
at
the
time
the
respondent
makes
his
statements,
that
waiver
--
there
has
to
be
a
waiver
and
it
has
to
be
a
knowing,
intelligent,
and
voluntary
one.
that
at
the
time
he
makes
his
statement
--
here
when
he
admitted
that
he
shot
the
boy
down,
he
had
to
understand
what
his
rights
were
and
there
had
--
those
statements
had
to
not
be
the
result
of
police
coercion.
and
no
court
here
has
found
that
they
were
the
result
of
police
coercion.
there
is
no
question
about
voluntariness
here.
so
what
we
understand
this
language
in
butler
to
mean
about
an
implied
waiver
is
the
fact
of
a
confession
itself
is
not
enough
to
show
the
government
has
met
its
burden.
when
the
court
talked
about
a
course
of
conduct,
it
talked
about
the
same
standard
that
it's
always
used
in
the
miranda
context,
that
came
up
again
recently
in
this
court's
decision
in
shatzer,
which
is
that
the
ultimate
question
is
a
knowing,
intelligent,
and
voluntary
waiver.
the
course
of
conduct
doesn't
mean
anything
more
than
that.
it
means
that
at
the
time
the
guy
spoke--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that
shows
that
he
decided
to
talk,
but
the
confession
itself
isn't
enough.
we
needed
to
have
--
the
state
needed
to
have
evidence
that
he
understood
his
rights,
which
he
said
he
did,
and
that
there
was
--
that
the
confession
was
not
the
product
of
police
coercion.
and
i
think
that
that
comes
through
directly
in
the
language
that's
at
issue
in
butler.
the
court
said
"an
express
written
or
oral
statement
of
waiver.
"
--to
remain
silent
or
the
right
to
counsel
--
"is
strong
proof
of
the
validity
of
the
waiver
but
not
inevitably
necessary.
"
"the
question
is
not
one
of
form,
but
whether
the
defendant,
in
fact,
knowingly
and
voluntarily
waived
the
rights
delineated
in
miranda.
"
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
before
the
evidence
can
be
admitted
at
trial.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
okay.
it's--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that
would
--
that
would
exact
a
substantial
price
on
law
enforcement,
and
that's
the
exact
argument
that
justice
brennan
made
in
the
butler
case
that
was
rejected.
he
was
in
dissent
in
that
case.
he
said
the
police
should
always
have
to
--
have
to
seek
a
waiver
before
they
interrogate.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
to
admit
the
evidence
at
trial,
there
has
to
be
a
waiver.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
not
every
police--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--manual
says
that.
that
brief
itself
cites
many
examples
going
both
ways.
it
is
often
the
case,
and
it
is
often
the
case
in
federal
law
enforcement,
that
the
police
try
to
seek
a
waiver
immediately
after
giving
rights
because
we
want
to
avoid
the
problems
of
proof
that
come
up
at
trial
if
we
don't
have
a
written
waiver.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
the
specific
citations
from
the
brief.
i
--
i
know
from
asking
the
federal
law
enforcement
agencies
--
dhs,
the
fbi,
and
the
dea
--
that
the
dea
does
not
invariably
seek
a
waiver
and
that
we
don't
understand
that
we
need
to
get
an
immediate
waiver.
and,
again,
that
was
what
justice
brennan
said
in
--
in
dissent
in
butler,
is
that
the
police
should
have
to
seek
an
immediate
waiver.
and
the
court
said,
no,
the
fifth
amendment
right
is
--
compel
--
about
compelled
statements
being
introduced
at
trial.
we
don't
need
this
protection,
that
the
police
have
to
seek
an
immediate
waiver.
in
fact,
if
you
adopted
a
rule
like
that,
it
would
essentially
take
any
burden
off
the
suspect
to
invoke
his
rights.
he
wouldn't
need
to
invoke
his
rights,
because
the
police
would
just
--
if
the
police
didn't
seek
a
waiver.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
exactly
right.
if
the
person--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
right.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
then
the
interrogation
stops.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
and
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
a
contrary
rule
would
have
to
overrule
butler,
because
the
court
said
you
can
clearly
infer
waiver
from
the
actions
and
words
of
the
person
interrogated.
that
assumes
that
the
person
is
being
interrogated.
just
to
talk
a
minute
about
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes,
at
the
time
that
the
person
makes
the
inculpatory
statements
that
are
going
at
be
introduced
at
trial,
it
must
be
the
case
that
he
decided
he
was
going
to
talk
to
the
police
knowingly,
intelligently,
and
voluntarily.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
and
we
say
that
the
waiver
occurred
at
the
time
he
answered
the
questions
about
his
belief
in
god.
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
he
said
in
response
to
the
earlier
questions,
as
long
as
at
the
time
that
he
answered
questions
about
god,
his
decision
to
talk
was
a
knowing
and
intelligent
and
voluntary
one.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
right.
but
respondent
made
a
voluntariness
argument
throughout
all
of
the
courts
in
this
case,
and
every
court
has
rejected
it.
