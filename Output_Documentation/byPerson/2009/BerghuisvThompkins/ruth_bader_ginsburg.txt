but
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
waive
them.
and
quite
unlike
butler
--
butler,
if
i
have
it
right,
said,
"i'll
talk
to
you".
so
that
was
a
statement--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
he
was
waiving
the
right
to
remain
silent.
he
volunteered
to
talk.
here
there
was
no
such
indication
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
didn't
say
--
we
don't
have
any
decision
that
says
the
police
are
home
free
for
2
and
a
quarter
hours.
you
said
that
that
this
was
not
lengthy
interrogation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
--
we
have
no
decision
that
says
that
the
police,
faced
with
a
silent
suspect,
goes
after
that
suspect,
questioning
him
incessantly
for
2
and
--
2
hours
and
15
minutes,
that
that
is
not
lengthy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
said
"yeah",
"no",
and
"i
don't
know".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
saying
then
that
the
defendant
has
to
--
never
has
to
invoke
his
right?
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
the
miranda
warning
adequate
in
this
case?
he
got
the
four
warnings,
but
then,
unlike
some
police
forms
that
then
ask
the
defendant,
do
you
waive
your
rights,
this
form
never
asked,
did
you
waive
your
rights?
it
just
said:
do
you
acknowledge
that
we
have
informed
you
of
your
rights?
