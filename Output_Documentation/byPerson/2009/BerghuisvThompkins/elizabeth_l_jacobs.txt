ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
i
review
miranda,
i
find
language
from
miranda
that
says
that
you
have
to
have
a
--
an
advice
of
rights
and
a
waiver
before
you
question.
and
i
just
want
to
direct
the
court
to
page
475
of
miranda:
requirement
of
warnings
and
waiver
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
not
simply
a
preliminary
ritual
to
existing
interrogation
methods.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
butler,
i
think,
is
an
interesting
case,
because
butler
is
mostly
aimed
at
the
right
to
counsel.
when
you
talk
about
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
to
remain
silent,
you
have
really
two
different
kinds
of
rights.
and
there's
an
assertion
requirement
in
the
right
to
counsel.
you
can't
exercise
that
right
without
getting
some
help
from
the
police.
but
the
right
to
remain
silent
--
we
don't
require
that
it
be
asserted.
it
is
a
presumption.
and
that
presumption
remains.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
essentially,
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
let
me
make
sure
that
i
--
that
i
said
yes
to
the
right
thing.
you
can
--
i
do
--
you
can
take
an
implied
waiver
of
the
--
of
the
right
to
silence.
i
--
i
do
agree
with
that.
and
i
look
at
the
cases
that
have
been
cited,
and
i
know
that
there
are
three
kinds
of
examples.
one
is
the
person
walks
into
the
police
station,
and
he
says
i
want
to
confess.
that's
a
voluntary
confession.
you
don't
have
to
assert
anything.
he's
--
he's
going
to
confess.
if
you
have
a
steady
stream
of
speech
in
which
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
talk
but
i'll
tell
you
about
this,
again,
you
have
somebody
acting
voluntarily.
someone
who
says
i'll
only
talk
about
drugs
but
i'm
not
going
to
talk
about
murder
--
he's
implied
he's
waived
his
right
to
that.
but
in
this
case,
when
you
look
at
this
case,
the
key
issue
really
is
was
it
volitional?
what
fact
would
lead
a
court
to
decide
that
there
--
that
my
client--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--yes,
absolutely.
you
have
an
implied
waiver.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
well,
davis
is
a
case
that
talks
about
the
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel,
but
does
not
apply
to
the
right
to
remain
silent.
so
i
think
as
long
as
you
still
have
the
presumption
of
--
the
presumption
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
a
presumptive
right,
the
police
have
to
do
something
to
move
you
off
square
one
in
order
to
make
it
voluntary.
am
i
answering
your
question,
justice
alito?
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
well,
justice
scalia,
i
just
read
you
page
475
from
miranda
that
says
the
requirement
is
warnings
and
waiver,
and
that's
not,
as
they
said,
a
preliminary
ritual.
that
means
more.
seibert
--
and
i
know
it's
a
preliminary
--
a
plurality--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--again,
butler
is
really
a
right
to
counsel
case.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
in
butler
the
--
the
waiver,
the
voluntary
act
of
the
person
being
interrogated
really
occurred
very,
very
early.
there
wasn't
any
kind
of
a
gap.
he
said,
i
don't
--
i
believe
he
said,
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
do
something
in
writing,
but
i'll
talk
to
you.
now,
that
is
a
voluntary
act:
i'm
going
to
talk
to
you.
that
is
clearly
a
waiver.
that
isn't
what
we've
got
in
this
case.
you
have
a
young
man
who
is
sitting
in
a
chair,
looking
at
the
ground;
he's
sullen.
the
only
time
he
looks
at
the
officer
is
when
the
officer
directs
him
to
look.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
no,
there
must
be
a
waiver.
there's
no
such
thing
as--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--okay.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
in
this
case,
because
it
went
--
because
the
interrogation
lasted
so
long--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--um--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--and
i
--
and
i
want
to
answer
you
with
what
--
what
i
read.
"the
requirement
of
warnings
and
waiver
is
fundamental.
"
my
argument
is
that
you
cannot
continue
to
question
someone
who
has
not
waived
the
right,
that
there's--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
think
you've
got
a
waiver.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
you've
got
a
waiver.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
but
he's
willing
to
talk
to
the
police.
in
my
case,
mr.
thompkins
was
unwilling.
he
could
--
he
would
not
look
at
anybody.
he
would
not
answer
questions.
we
don't
know
what
the
"i
don't
know"
and
the
"yeah"
was
to.
so
that's
a
very
--
my
case
is
a
very
different
case
than
what
you
are
proposing.
there
is
no
willingness
to
engage
with
the
police;
there
is,
in
fact,
this
feeling
that
there
is
coercion
going
on.
the
longer
that
interrogation--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
think
he
is
engaging
in
a
conversation.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
think
he's
engaging
in
a
conversation
with
the
police
and
that
the
police
at
that
point
can
continue
to
talk.
but
that
isn't
what
happened
in
this
case.
there
was
no
indication
by
my
client
that
he
wanted
to
listen,
that
he
wanted
to
talk.
the
longer
that
interrogation
lasted,
the
more--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--what
is
key,
i
think,
in
your
--
in
your
hypothetical
and
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
is
that
you
have
a
defendant
that
feels
comfortable,
that
is
not
being
oppressed
by
this
coercive
atmosphere.
my
client
did
not
engage
in
anything,
and
the
longer
he
sat
there,
the
greater
the
chances
that
anything
he
said
was
the
product
of
coercion.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
justice
stevens,
that's
kind
of
iffy.
the
police
officer--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--yes,
the
police
officer
in
this
case
said
either
"i
don't
remember
whether
i
asked
him.
"
or
"i
think
he
nodded
that
he
understood.
"
i
don't
think
we've
got
a
real
solid
proof
of
that.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes,
it
was
read
to
him.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
don't
think
they
had
him
read
a
portion--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--justice
scalia.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
okay.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
guess
it
was
just
that
they
didn't
ask
him
to
write
anything,
so
that
they
didn't
know
whether
he
could
write
in
english.
yes,
justice
scalia,
you're
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
you
need--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--you
are
presuming
that
a
defendant
thinks
that
they've
got
the
kind
of
power
to
look
at
a
police
officer
and
say,
"i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
"
"remove
me.
"
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
what--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--there
is
nothing
in
--
on
this
record
that
indicates
that
he
wanted
to
listen
to
them
as
opposed
to
what
justice
alito's
hypothetical
is,
where
the
gentleman
says:
well,
i'm
not
going
to
say
anything,
but
i
want
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say.
we
don't
have
that
here.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
there's
no
clearly
established
law
that
says
that
he
has
to
assert
his
right
to
remain
silent.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
think
that
because
there
is
the
presumption
of
the
--
the
privilege
is
a
presumptive
right,
that
he
does
not
have
to
assert
it.
this
is
--
this
is
--
the
right,
or
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
constitutional
command,
is
the
one
right
that
really
defines
our
criminal
justice
system.
it
means
that
you
cannot
talk
to
--
the
police
do
not
have
the
right
to
talk
to
the
defendant.
it
makes
us
an
accusatorial
system--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--well,
when--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--right.
that's
correct.
but
if
you
are
going
to
adopt
the
suggestion
of
the
government
that
you
do
pre-interrogation
waiver,
which
i
think
is
what
we're
talking
about
--
that
is,
you
don't
give
him
his
rights
and
then
you
can
just
talk
and
talk
until
you
are
blue
in
the
face,
that
that
ends
up
being
a
more
coercive
situation
than
we
have
now.
this
is
the
kind
of
situation
that
could
have
been
easily
resolved
just
by
the
officer
asking
mr.
thompkins,
do
you
want
to
talk
to
us?
instead,
once
they
establish--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--he
could
--
that's
fine.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
then
--
then
he's
not
cooperating.
he's
not
waiving
his
rights.
it's
not
voluntary.
take
him
back
to
the
cell,
that's
it.
because
the
police--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--the
state
of
the
--
the
state
of
the
law
is
a
defendant
does
not
have
to
invoke
his
right
to
remain
silent.
davis
is
the
invocation
case;
it
applies
to
the
second
stage
of
--
of
the
interrogation.
and
it
has
to
do
with--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
all
that
form
said.
and
what
the
officer
said
is
once
mr.
thompkins
would
not
sign
it,
he
then
moved
into
interview
mode.
there
was
no
further
--
if
this
was
an
ambiguous
act
to
him,
then
the
officer
should
have
asked
a
clarifying
question.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i'm
saying
you
don't
have
to
invoke
the
right
to
remain
silent,
that
that's
not
the
state
of
the
law,
that
only
the
right
to
remain
--
i'm
sorry
--
the
right
to
counsel
must
be
invoked.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
the
state
actually
found
two
--
i
think
you're
saying
that
there
was
an
objectively
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts
in
this
case?
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
and
i
think
that--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--it's
one
way
or
the
other.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
and
i
think
clearly
that
there
--
that
there
were
facts
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
found
that
were
not
supported
by
the
record
and
were
objectively
unreasonable.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
when
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
the
defendant
continued
to
talk
with
officers,
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
that
was
an
objectively
unreasonable
finding
because
there
was
no
continuation,
there
was
no
talking.
they
also
found
unreasonable
that
the
defendant
talked
with
officers
sporadically.
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
that
was
a
misrepresentation
of
the
record.
the
last
fact
that
they
talked
about
is
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
defendant
made
eye
contact
several
times
or
a
number
of
times.
and
the
sixth
circuit
said,
quote
--
this
is
what
the
--
they
said
that
that
was
incorrect.
what
the
officer
said
at
the
hearing
is
that
eye
contact
came
only
at
the
end,
one
of
the
very
--
one
of
the
very
first
times
came
only
at
the
end.
so
--
but
those
are
important
facts.
the
fact
that
he
was
not
continuing
to
talk
--
he
wasn't
talking
at
all.
how
do
you
find
this
--
this
voluntariness,
that
the
rights
are
waived--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
don't
want
to
say
it's
true--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--just
because
you
are
asking
it.
if
you
invoke
those
--
if
you
invoke
--
if
you
hold
that
he
has
to
invoke
those
rights.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
well,
my
theory
is
that
you
don't
get
past
the
failure
to
get
the
waiver.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
returning
now
to
--
to
the
idea
of
the
pre-interrogation
waiver,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
would
return
this
--
this
court
back
to
the
kind
of
test
that
miranda
stopped,
which
was
the
applying
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
and
that
you
would
then,
again,
revert
to
pre-miranda
law,
where
--
and
this
i
believe
is
what
the
wayne
county
prosecutor
amicus
wants
to
do,
is
just
apply
totality
of
the
--
the
circumstances
test
to
whether
in
fact
someone
has
waived
their
rights.
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
miranda
has
not
been
a
failure,
that
this
bright-line
rule
--
you
give
the
rights,
you
get
the
waiver,
then
can
you
talk
--
that
that's--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--justice
scalia,
the
opposite
of
that
then
becomes
the
ability
to
keep
the
defendant
in
a
room,
and
the
longer--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--and
we
would
just
suggest
that
the
state
court
applied
moseley
incorrectly
and
applied
miranda,
that
those
are
the
clearly
established
law
in
that
case.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
but
if
interrogation
continues,
the
longer
it
continues
the
less
likely
that
the
statement
that
is
taken
is
going
to
be
the
product
of
my
client's
free
will.
so
the
government
is
going
to
have
an
even
greater
burden
in
trying
to
prove
that
this
statement
was
voluntary
or
that
the
waiver
of
rights
is
voluntary.
so
this
court
should
not
adopt
a
pre-interrogation
waiver
rule,
especially
not
one
that
--
that
ends
up
being
as
long
as
this
case
is,
and
just
in
case--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
think
that
they
can
say
to
the
person:
do
you
now
want
to
waive
your
right
and
talk
to
us
or
do
you
want
to
remain
silent?
i
think
that
that's
an
easy
and
expedient
answer.
if--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--then
that's
it.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
then
that's
it.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
there's
no
burden
--
i
mean,
then
the
burden
isn't
met,
this
heavy
burden
that
he
has
knowingly,
intelligently,
and
voluntarily
waived
those
rights.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
well,
moseley
says
that
the
longer
that
you
question
someone,
that
--
moseley
is
the
persistent
questioning
case,
where
you
keep
questioning
the
guy
and
questioning
the
guy.
and
this
is
very
clearly
a
moseley
case.
you've
got
two
officers
in
that
room,
and
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
they
are
both
questioning
and
they
talk
about
the
different
themes
they
used.
and
the
very
fact
that
they
had
to
change
themes
showed
that
the
defendant
was
not
being
cooperative
and
not
--
and
was
not
engaging
in
this
conversation
willingly.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
and
all
they
had
to
say
--
i've
got
to
take
the
flip
side
--
is
--
and
because
it's
their
house,
because
if
they
don't
want
to
create
the
ambiguity,
they
are
the
ones
that
have
to
say:
will
you
talk
to
us
now?
they
don't
even
have
to
ask
him
to
sign
the
waiver,
although
i
think
the
waiver
is
proof
positive.
once
he
signs
the
waiver,
you
know,
i
haven't
got
much
to
argue
in
terms
of
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
but
if
they
create
the
ambiguity,
then
according
to
miranda,
that
ambiguity
is
resolved
against
them.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
because
they
are
leaving
--
they're
not
moving
off
of
square
one.
they're
leaving
this,
where
they
are
not
looking
for
an
answer
to
whether
the
rights
want
to
be
waived
and
they
are
immediately,
as
they
did
in
this
case,
going
into
interview
mode.
they
are
going
to
start
to
question
him.
and
this
gets
to
moseley,
where,
in
fact,
you
end
up
where
you
are
badgering
somebody,
and
in
this
case,
they
used
many
different
tactics:
the
softening
technique
--
here,
have
a
mint.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
if
you
are
going
to
base
this
on
an
implied
waiver,
don't
you
have
to
look
to
see
what
the
circumstances
were
that
were
going
on?
how
can
you
look
at
the
very
end
of
a
2-hour
and--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
if
you
find
that
the
officer
does
not
have
to
ask
the
question,
does
not
have
to
clarify
whether
in
fact
the
defendant
is
remaining
silent,
then
i
do
have
to
talk
to
the
rest
to
try
and
persuade
you
that
in
those
2
hours
and
45
minutes
he
was
not
being
cooperative,
he
was
not
willingly
entering
into--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--well--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
did
--
i
did
talk
about
voluntariness
in
my
brief
to
this
court.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
[laughter]
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
if
--
if
you
were
going
to
go
and
use
implied
waiver,
if
--
and
i
think
that
you
can
use
an
implied
waiver,
you
--
you
are
interested
in
looking
at
what
happened
in
this
case
to
decide
whether,
in
fact,
the
"yes"
answers
were
an
implied
waiver.
and
that's
why
i'm
arguing
about
the
circumstances,
that
there's
nothing
in
these
circumstances
that
could
lead
you
to
believe
that
after
2
hours
and
45
minutes,
there
was
a
voluntary
waiver,
the
implied
waiver.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i'm
willing
to
talk
to
you,
but
i
won't
put
anything
in
writing.
i'll
willing
to
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say,
but
i'm
not
going
to
answer
your
questions.
and
then
your
--
then
as
the
conversation
--
a
conversation
ensues,
and
i
think
this
is
what
justice
alito--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--okay.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
okay.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
then
let
me
give
another
example
of
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
remain
silent.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
well,
it's
not
a
new
right.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
it's
--
it's
not
a
new
right.
it's
not
a
new
right.
the
police
cannot
interrogate
the
defendant
unless
they
read
him
his
rights
and
my
understanding
of
miranda
is
that
they
obtain
a
waiver
of
those
rights.
without
obtaining
the
waiver,
questioning
cannot
ensue,
because
then
the
rest
of
the
questioning
becomes
trying
to
talk
the
defendant
into
waiving
the
rights,
trying
to
talk
the
defendant
into
confessing,
and
you
have
badgering
and
you
have
persistent
questioning,
and
you
don't
end
up
with
a
volitional
waiver
or
a
volitional
statement.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
well,
it's
--
the
implied
waiver
case
is
north
carolina
v.
butler.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
but
butler
--
i
don't
think
you
have
to
overrule
butler,
because
butler
really
was
a
right
to
counsel
case.
it
did
talk
about
the
right
to
remain
silent,
but
most
of
language
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
this
gentleman
did
not
waive
the
right
to
counsel.
so,
i
don't
think
you
have
to.
i
think
you
can
still
have
implied
waivers.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
that's
a
hard
question,
and
i
don't
have
--
i
don't
have
an
easy
answer
or
a
hard
answer
for
you.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
you
want
to
hog-tie
the
police.
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
the
police
should
be
able
to
talk
to
a
defendant,
but
there's
got
--
but
it's
got
to
be
voluntary,
and
that
in
order
to
do
that,
you
really
have
to
get
a
waiver.
u.s.
v.
cardwell
i
think
is
an
implied
waiver
where
the
defendant
starts
to
talk
to
the
officer
there
--
they're
in
a
police
car,
and
the
defendant
starts
to
talk
to
the
officer
after
an
hour
and
a
half
of
silence,
although
that,
again,
isn't
a
custodial
situation,
but
the
police
found
--
but
the
court
found
that
that
was,
in
fact,
a
waiver.
so
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
cede
my
time.
thank
you.
