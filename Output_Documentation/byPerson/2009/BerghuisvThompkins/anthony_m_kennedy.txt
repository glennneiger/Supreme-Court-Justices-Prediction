justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
clearly
established
rule
that
in
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
we
can
find
that
there
is
coercion,
time
being
one
aspect
of
those
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
that
is
a
clearly
established
rule,
and
then
it's
a
question
whether
2
and
a
half,
3
and
a
half,
4
and
a
half
suffices.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
--
your
position
is
that
if
--
same
facts,
but
it's
10
hours
instead
of
2
and
a
half,
is
that
a
closer
case,
at
least?
for--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
does
that
show
that
--
that
the
circumstances
are
coercive,
so
that
even
if
there
were
a
waiver
it
would
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you're
saying
there's
a
difference
between
a
waiver
and
a
failure
to
assert?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
do
you
read
--
yes.
so
do
you
read
miranda
as
saying
that
there
cannot
be
questioning
unless
there
is
a
waiver?
then
we'll
go
on
to
--
or
do
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--okay,
you
do
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
are
you
going
to
go
on
--
because
this
is
right
where
you
are.
are
you
going
to
go
on
to
say
that,
in
the
miranda
context,
the
failure
to
assert
can
--
can
suffice
to
allow
the
questioning
to
proceed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
isn't
that
language
that
you
quote
a
negative
inference
that
there
must
be
a
waiver?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there's
a
difference
between
waiving
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation
and
then
waiving
it
at
the
time
of
trial?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
where
we
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
--
you're
conceding,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
must
be
a
waiver?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
don't
understand
--
why
--
why
can't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
have
to
guide
the
police.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
don't
we
tell
the
police,
there
must
be
a
waiver
before
you
can
continue
to
interrogate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
why
you
didn't
answer
justice
stevens's
questions
by
saying,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
care
about
waiver.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
assertion
of
the
right.
but
you're
not
saying
that.
you
are
admitting
there
has
to
be
a
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
also
assumes
there
has
to
be
a
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
--
he
didn't
say
anything.
you
--
i
think
you
could
say
that
his
conduct
implied
the
very
kind
of
statement
that
justice
alito
suggested
in
his
hypothetical:
i'll
listen
to
you
guys
for
a
while.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought,
in
order
to
test
his
knowledge
of
english,
they
asked
him
to
read
one
or
two
paragraphs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
how
you
square
that
with
moseley.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
this
was
compressed
to
45
minutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
same
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
30
minutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
15?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
have
to
say

did
--

did
the
subsequent
cases

an

view
that's
closer
to
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
after
a
jury
trial
in
a
michigan
state
court,
van
chester
tompkins
was
convicted
of
murder.
in
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
that
there
had
been
two
separate
constitutional
errors
to
this
trial.
first,
they
determined
that
a
statement
by
the
accused
relied
on
at
trial
by
the
prosecution
had
been
elicited
in
violation
of
miranda
versus
arizona.
second,
it
found
that
failure
to
ask
for
an
instruction
relating
to
testimony
from
an
accomplice
was
ineffective
assistance
by
defense
counsel.
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
both
of
its
rulings.
we
begin
with
the
miranda
issue.
after
arresting
thompkins,
two
detectives
interrogated
him
and
one
was
detective
helgert.
helgert
presented
tompkins
with
a
written
form
derived
from
the
miranda
rule.
the
form
was
broken
down
into
five
parts
at
the
request
of
detective
helgert,
thompkins
himself
read
one
of
these
parts
out
loud
the
others
were
read
aloud
by
helgert.
the
officers
then
began
the
interrogation.
at
no
point
did
thompkins
say
he
wanted
to
remain
silent
or
that
he
did
not
wanted
to
talk
to
the
police
or
that
he
wanted
an
attorney.
he
was
largely
silent
during
the
investigation
and
it
lasted
about
three
hours.
about
two
and
three
quarters
hours
into
the
interrogation,
two
hours
and
45
minutes
helgert
asked
thompkins,
do
you
pray
to
god
to
forgive
you
for
shooting
that
boy
down.
thompkins
answered
yes
and
looked
away
and
that
was
the
statement
that
was
used
against
thompkins
at
his
trial.
thompkins
argued
that
he
invoked
his
right
to
remain
silent
by
not
saying
anything
for
a
sufficient
period
of
time.
so
that
the
interrogation
should
have
ceased
before
he
made
his
inculpatory
statements.
this
argument
is
unpersuasive.
to
invoke
the
miranda
right
to
remain
silent
an
accused
must
do
so
unambiguously.
a
requirement
of
an
unambiguous
invocation
of
miranda
rights
results
in
an
objective
inquiry
that
avoids
difficulties
of
proof
and
provides
guidance
to
officers
on
how
to
proceed
in
the
face
of
ambiguity.
thompkins
did
not
say
that
he
wanted
to
remain
silent
or
that
he
did
not
want
to
talk
with
the
police.
had
he
made
either
of
these
simple
statements,
he
would
have
invoked
his
right
to
cut
off
questioning.
now,
even
absent
the
accused
invocation
of
the
right
to
remain
silent,
a
statement
by
the
accused
during
custodial
interrogation
is
still
inadmissible
at
trial
unless
the
prosecution
can
establish
that
the
accused
in
fact
knowingly
and
voluntarily
waive
miranda
rights
when
making
the
statement
and
thompkins
contend
that
he
did
not
--
contends
that
he
did
not
waive
his
right
to
remain
silent.
the
course
of
decisions
since
miranda
informed
by
the
application
of
miranda
warnings
in
the
whole
course
of
law-enforcement
demonstrates
that
waivers
can
be
established
even
absent
formal
or
express
statements
of
waiver.
the
main
purpose
of
miranda
is
to
ensure
that
the
accused
is
advised
of
and
understands
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
the
right
to
counsel.
thus
the
miranda
rule
and
its
requirements
are
met
if
a
suspect
receives
adequate
miranda
warnings,
understands
them,
and
has
an
opportunity
to
invoke
the
rights
before
giving
any
answers.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
thompkins
waived
his
right
to
remain
silent.
there
is
no
contention
that
thompkins
did
not
understand
his
rights.
thompkins
was
given
a
form
that
listed
his
rights
and
all
of
the
rights
were
read
aloud
one
by
thompkins
and
the
others
by
detective
helgert.
thompkins’
answers
to
detective
helgert's
question
about
whether
thompkins
prayed
to
god
for
forgiveness
for
shooting
the
victim
is
a
course
of
conduct
indicating
waiver
of
the
right
to
remain
silent.
there
is
no
evidence
that
thompkins
statement
coerced,
nor
were
the
police
required
to
obtain
a
waiver
of
thompkins’
right
to
remain
silent
before
interrogating
him.
in
1979,
in
north
carolina
versus
paul
butler,
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
we
adhere
to
that
decision
today.
in
sum
the
state
court’s
decisions
rejecting
--
decision
rejecting
thompkins'
miranda
claim
was
correct.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
thompkins
counsel
provided
ineffective
assistance
by
failing
to
request
the
limiting
instruction
regarding
how
the
jury
could
consider
the
outcome
of
an
accomplice’s
trial.
for
reasons
given
in
our
opinion
the
record
establishes
that
it
was
not
reasonably
likely
that
the
instruction
would
have
made
any
difference
in
light
of
all
the
other
evidence
of
guilt.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
with
instructions
to
deny
the
petition.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
