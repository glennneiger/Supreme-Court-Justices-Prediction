justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
without
more
detail,
which
is
what
the
circuit
court
said,
about
what
the
limited
responses
--
i'm
using
your
word
--
were.
how
do
we
--
how
can
we
imply
waiver?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning
if
all
he
said
was,
yes,
i
want
them
in,
that's
much
different
than
saying,
if
someone
had
asked
him,
do
you
want
to
leave,
and
he
shakes
his
head
no.
the
latter
might
imply
to
me
that
he
waived,
but
the
former
certainly
would
be
neutral.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
we
do
with
our
case
law
that
says
that
you
can't
infer
waiver
simply
from
the
confession?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
we
have
said
that.
so
that's
pretty
clearly
established
statement--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--by
the
court.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
think
certainly
in
--
in
butler,
if
someone
in
their
confession
says,
i
know
i
don't
have
to
talk
to
you,
but
i
want
to,
that
that
would
be
using
those
words.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
can
you
say--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
can
you
say
that
an
appeal
to
someone's
religious
position
after
2
and
a
quarter
hours
is
a
voluntary
waiver?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
want
to
change
the
miranda
rule
to
say:
tell
someone
their
rights,
and
unless
they
explicitly
say
"i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
"
then
they
implicitly
under
virtually
any
circumstance
haven't.
that's
what
you
believe
the
rule
in
miranda
and
butler
and
davis
sets
forth?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
wasn't
--
there
wasn't
silence
in
butler.
there
was
an
express
"i
want
to
talk
to
you.
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
--
but
we
go
back
to
the
point
you
made
earlier.
your
position
is
the
moment
that
someone
confesses,
that's
an
implicit
waiver.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
as
i
read
this
transcript,
the
police's
tactic,
by
their
own
statement,
was
to
approach
him
and
say:
this
is
our
evidence.
explain
yourself
--
that's
the
words
the
officer
used
--
but
he's
entitled
to
an
alternative
explanation.
tell
us.
what's
clear
is
that
at
no
point
did
he
answer
those
questions,
because
nothing
about
the
nods
of
the
head
or
anything
else
showed
a
willingness
to
confess.
and
even
in
the
responses
he
gave,
he
answered
a
series
of
questions
with
a
"yes",
but
not
with
an
explanation,
which
was
what
was
being
requested.
so
my
question
is,
how
does
one
infer
a
voluntary
statement
from
a
situation
in
which
someone's
really
not
talking?
i've
never
understood
how
a
yes
or
a
nod
to
questions
that
don't
--
that's
what
the
circuit
said,
to
questions
that
we
don't
know
what
they
were
about
--
do
you
want
a
mint
or
not,
i
don't
even
know
that
--
can
reflect
voluntariness?
and
i
understand
that
in
butler
when
someone
says
i
don't
want
to
sign
that,
but
i'm
going
to
spill
my
guts
now,
and
does,
that's
a
course
of
conduct
one
could
view
as
voluntary.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
when
the
police
have
to
stop?
they
read
somebody
their
rights;
the
person
says
nothing.
are
you
saying
at
that
point
they
have
to
stop?
