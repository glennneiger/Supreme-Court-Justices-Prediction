but
in
this
case,
it
was
the
fact
of
the
concession
--
the
confession
that
constituted
the
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
--
just
refresh
my
recollection.
in
the
record
in
this
case,
do
we
know
whether
he
said
he
understood
his
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
was
present
in
butler.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
doesn't
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask,
can
you
go
back
to
page

in
your
reply
brief?
"once
warnings
have
been
given,
the
subsequent
procedure
is
clear.
"
"if
the
individual
indicates
in
any
manner,
at
any
time
prior
to
or
during
questioning,
that
he
wishes
to
remain
silent,
the
interrogation
must
cease.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
question
is
whether
during
those
two
hours
by
not
answering
a
--
a
number
of
questions,
did
he
indicate
in
any
way
that
he
wished
to
remain
silent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
says
that
any
--
in
any
manner
that
he
wished
to
remain
silent.
and
until
the
2
hours
and
a
half
later
when
he
did
answer
the
three
questions,
that's
pretty
--
it's
at
least
arguable
that
his
silence
indicated
he
wished
to
remain
silent.
