justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
happened
about
2
hours
and
15
minutes
into
the
exercise,
didn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
--
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
course
of
conduct,
2
hours
and
15
minutes
of
saying
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
say
that
that's
--
that's
gone
past
the
point
where--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
butler
he
said:
i
will
talk
to
you,
but
i
am
not
signing
any
forms.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
say
is,
"a
course
of
conduct"
--
we
will
not
hold
--
"this
does
not
mean
a
defendant's
silence,
coupled
with
an
understanding
and
a
course
of
conduct
indicating
waiver,
may
never
support
a
conclusion.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
the
prosecution's
burden
is
great.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
going
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
is
there
anything
during
the
2
hours
and
15
minutes
that
could
suggest
a
waiver?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
miranda
held
that
you
can't
question
a
person
unless
he
waives
his
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
question
him
even
after
he
--
it's
clear
that
he
hadn't
waived
his
right.
is
that
--
that's
miranda?
or
at
least
that's
unclear?
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
waiver.
i'm
saying,
imagine
that
it's
clear
that
a
person
hasn't
waived
his
right.
now
let's
suppose
he
says,
"i
do
not
waive
my
right.
"
okay?
now,
is
it
clear
law
that
once
he
says
the
police
cannot
continue
to
question
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
clear
law,
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
yes.
if
that's
clear
law,
would
you
say
that
at
some
point
before
the
2
hours
and
15
minutes
expires
where
they're
continuously
asking
him
questions
and
he
says
nothing,
that
it
has
become
clear
that
he
has
not
waived
his
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
the
question
is
not
this.
the
question
is
whether,
after
2
hours
and
15
minutes
of
silence,
it
is
clear
--
it's
nothing
about
supreme
court
law.
supreme
court
law
is
clear:
you
cannot
question
him
after
he
makes
clear
he
hasn't
waived
his
right.
so
then
the
question
becomes,
is
it
reasonable
for
a
state
court
to
say
--
after
2
hours
and
15
minutes
of
asking
questions
and
he
says
nothing,
is
it
reasonable
to
hold
that
he
has
not
--
conclude
that
he
has
not
waived
his
rights?
is
that
the
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
you
do
with
miranda's
statement
"but
a
valid
waiver
will
not
be
presumed
simply
from
the
silence
of
the
accused.
"
--i
grant
you,
as
modified
in
butler
to
say
that
the
state
has
a
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
the
silence
followed
by
a
confession
--
the
state
has
a
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
that
is
an
affirmative
waiver.
now,
those
i
think
are
the
two
statements
of
law,
the
third
being
that
after,
if
there
is
no
waiver,
the
police
cannot
continue
to
question.
now,
i
thought
that
was
the
clear
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
grant
you,
you
might
argue
for
a
change
in
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
say
it
would
change
the
police's
behavior?
inbau
and
reid
and,
you
know,
the
--
the
nac
--
the
defense
lawyers'
brief
here
is
filled
with
quotations
from
typical
police
manuals,
and
they
all
seem
to
say
things
like
you
have
to
have
at
--
once
the
waiver
is
given,
the
police
may
proceed
with
interrogation.
that
seems
to
be
what
police
today
are
instructed
across
the
country.
it
says
you
cannot
question
people
until
he
indicates
after
the
warning
is
given
a
willingness
to
answer
questions.
that's
the
police
manual.
so
why
do
you
say
this
would
extract
a
price
on
law
enforcement
when
the
typical
police
manuals
seem
to
say
what
the
petitioner
here
is
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
the
respondent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
--
which
are
the
police
manuals
that
go
your
way?
because
i
want
to
look
at
those,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
miranda
does
not
say
that.
i
mean,
i
think
--
i
think
that
justice
scalia
is
right
on
that,
that
miranda
doesn't
say
you
can't
question
him.
the
pages
that
you
read
to
us
say
that
if
you
have
a
lengthy
questioning,
then
the
fact
that
he
then
gives
a
statement
cannot
be
taken
as
a
--
cannot
be
admitted.
that's
--
that's
what
it
seems
to
say
on
page
476--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
absence
of
some
special
circumstance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right?
i
mean
miranda
does
not
explicitly
say
that
you
cannot
continue
questioning.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
because
i
don't
know.
i
didn't
see
it
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
think
that
was
the
question.
the
question,
at
least
as
i
understood
it,
is
that
miranda
says
you
cannot
admit
a
confession
into
evidence
unless
he
has
first
waived
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
it
says,
clearly,
that
even
if
the
police
and
the
prosecution
testify
he
did
waive
it,
even
if
they
say
he
did,
explicitly,
still,
if
there's
a
long
questioning,
even
then,
the
court
should
be
very
careful
about
admitting
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
doesn't
it
flow
from
that
a
fortiori
that
if
he
doesn't
admit
it
and
all
there
is,
is
the
long
questioning
that,
there
has
been
no
waiver?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
answered
three
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
one,
do
you
believe
in
god?
yes.
two,
do
you
pray
to
god?
three,
have
you
asked
god
for
forgiveness
for
shooting
the
boy?
okay.
so,
where
--
where
did
he
waive
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
this
case,
after
2
hours
and
15
minutes
when
he
gave
the
answers
i
just
said,
when
did
he
waive
his
miranda
rights?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
think
any
then
--
then
miranda
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
says
you
can't
admit
the
stuff
after
a
long
questioning
unless
he
waives.
obviously,
he
says
something
or
there
would
be
nothing
to
admit.
