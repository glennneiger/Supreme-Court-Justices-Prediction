justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
argument
is
that
you
can
infer
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
from
conduct,
but
you
can't
infer
waiver
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
from
conduct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
basically
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
defendant
here
had
said
at
the
beginning,
i
don't
know
whether
i
--
i
want
to
talk
to
you
or
not,
but
i'm
going
to
listen
to
your
questions
and
i
might
answer
some
and
i
might
answer
others
--
that
would
be
a
different
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
where
is
there
--
what
supreme
court
case
establishes
the
distinction
between
those
two
situations
clearly?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
really
understand.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
your
answer
was
that
there
does
not
have
to
be
a
waiver
before
questioning
can
occur.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
must
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--so,
what
if
the
person
says:
i'm
not
waiving,
but
i'm
not
saying
that
i
will
never
waive.
i'll
listen
to
your
questions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
he
says--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i'm
not
waiving?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
interrupt?
before
i
can
understand
your
case,
i
would
like
to
understand
this
hypothetical.
if
the
person
says:
i'm
not
waiving,
but
i'm
not
telling
you
that
i
won't
waive
at
some
point
in
the
future.
i'll
listen
to
your
questions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
a
waiver.
