mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
rejecting
mr.
thompkins's
miranda
claim
and
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
the
michigan
courts
did
not
unreasonably
apply
clearly
established
supreme
court
precedent.
i
plan
to
focus
on
the
miranda
claim.
now,
with
respect
to
the
miranda
claim,
there
really
are
two
distinct
inquiries
at
issue.
the
first
is
whether
mr.
thompkins
impliedly
waived
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
and,
second,
whether
he
invoked
his
right
to
remain
silent
during
a
police
interview.
regarding
the
waiver
question,
this
court
established
in
butler
that
there
may
be
an
implied
waiver,
even
where
a
suspect
remains
silent
after
having
received
his
miranda
warnings,
where
that
suspect
knowingly
receives
his
rights
and
there
is
a
course
of
conduct
that
indicates
waiver.
the
michigan
courts
here
did
not
unreasonably
conclude
that
mr.
thompkins
had
impliedly
waived
his
rights
where
he
expressly
acknowledged
his
rights
under
--
from
his
form.
after
having
read
out
loud
from
that
form,
he
participated
in
a
limited
fashion
during
the
interview.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
but--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--although
in
butler
this
court
noted
that
--
that
butler
himself
had
remained
silent
and
did
not
answer
the
--
answer
at
all,
or
remained
silent
when
asked
whether
he
wished
to
waive
his
right
to
counsel.
so
the
--
the
standard
that
was
established
from
which
the
michigan
courts
relied
is
really
on
this
--
this
language
of
the
standard
established
from
butler,
that
you
can
--
you
can
imply
waiver
from
the
knowing
reception,
and
then
a
course
of
conduct,
because
the
--
the
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
words
and
actions
of
the
person
interrogated.
and
here--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--i
have
to
carefully
delineate
between
waiver
and
invocation.
so
here
the
waiver
occurs
at
the
time
that
he
is
asked
the
series
of
questions:
do
you
believe
in
god?
do
you
pray
to
god?
did
you
pray
for
forgiveness--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
right.
it
happened
near
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
we--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
this
--
if
you're
looking
at
what
has
been
clearly
established
for
this
court,
this
court
has
never
--
i
mean,
one
of
the
arguments
raised
against
the
position
i'm
advocating
is
that
there
is
an
immediacy
requirement.
well,
this
court
in
butler
didn't
say
that
the
waiver
had
to
occur
immediately.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
right.
but
if
you
look
at
what's
the
clearly
established
law
--
this
court
identified
the
standard,
what
can
be
inferred
from
the
words
and
actions
of
the
person
interrogated.
and
if
you
look
at
what
the
two--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
right.
and
if
--
if
you
look
at
the
two
aspects
of
what
constitutes
a
waiver,
it's
knowing
and
intelligent,
and
voluntary.
at
the
time
that
mr.
thompkins
gave
his
answer
to
that
series
of
questions,
there's
nothing
in
the
course
of
that
interview
that
suggested
that
no
longer
did
he
know
that
he
didn't
have
to
answer
questions.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
the
--
the
--
the
waiver
occurs
at
the
time
that
he
answered
the
question.
so
the
answer
is
that
he
didn't
waiver
before
then,
but
that
--
it
still
is
evidence
to
show
that
that
course
--
that
nothing
the
police
had
done
--
there
were
no
threats--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--the
courts
on
direct
review
have
allowed
--
where
there's
a
knowing
reception
of
one's
rights,
have
allowed
the
answers
themselves
to
provide
the
evidence
that
the
person
did
waive
his
rights.
in
fact--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--but
that
would
be--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that
would
be
an
express
waiver,
though.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
well,
if
you
look
at
what
this
court
has
provided
in
terms
of
guidance
regarding
what
constitutes
a
lengthy
interrogation,
miranda
notes
that
a
lengthy
interrogation
would
be
strong
evidence
against
there
being
a
valid
waiver.
but
what
this
court
has
determined
to
be
a
lengthy
interrogation
were
interrogations
of
much
longer
duration.
in
fact,
miranda
even
talks
about--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
well,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
factual
record
here
was
established
by
the
state
court,
and
the
factual
record
isn't
that
he
remained
absolutely
silent,
but
that
he
participated--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
but
he
was
participating.
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
remaining
absolutely
silent
and
participating--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no,
and
in
fact--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no,
there's
no
case
law
to
that
effect.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
the
position
that--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
the
position--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--i
think
that's
right.
and
what
--
one
of
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
the
--
the
case
that
i
cited
was
frazier
v.
cupp,
in
which
the
interview
started
at
5:00
p.m.
and
it
finished
at
6:45
p.m.,
and
the
court
called
that
an
interrogation
of
short
duration.
and
it
is
important
to
remember
that
this
court
has
stated
expressly
in
davis
that
once
you
have
knowingly
received
your
rights,
that
the
knowing
reception
itself
dispels
the
inherently
coercive
aspect--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
a
very
different
case,
because
there
is
case
law
--
like
i
cited
blackburn
was
an
interview
that
ran
8
or
9
hours,
and
this
court
found
that
that
person
was
probably
incompetent
or
insane.
but
that
duration
is
--
there's
been
guidance
about
that
kind
of
long
duration,
whereas
in
our--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
that's
the
suggestion
from
miranda,
that
a
lengthy
interrogation
preceding
the
waiver
can
suggest
the
waiver
was
not
valid.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
right.
and,
ultimately,
the
question
is
what
guidance
is
there
to
the
state
of
michigan
in
applying
the
implied
waiver
doctrine
to
indicate
that
the
implied
waiver
couldn't
come
after
2
hours
and
15
minutes
of
interaction
in
which
it
concluded
that
the
--
that
the
suspect
had
been
a
willing
participant.
the
testimony
from
detective
helgert,
which
--
he
was
the
only
person
to
testify
at
the
evidentiary
hearing,
is
that--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no,
miranda
in
fact
talks
about--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--warnings
--
warnings
is
a
prerequisite
to
questioning,
but
the
waiver
is
not.
in
fact--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--if
there
is
a--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--yes,
that
if
there
is--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no.
the
factual
record--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--yes.
the
question
as
i
see
it
is
that
--
let
me
see
if
i
understand.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
question.
there's
a
difference
between
refusing
to
waive,
saying
i
will
not
waive
my
rights.
essentially
if
you
make
it
an
expressed
statement
that
you
are
unwilling
to
waive,
then
essentially
it
is
in
that
case
--
i
want
to
keep
this
separate,
but
that
would
be
an
invocation:
i
do
not
wish
to
answer
your
questions.
if
you
make
a
crystal-clear
statement
like
that,
it's
a
different
question.
but
here
mr.
thompkins
didn't
say
he
was
unwilling
to
waive.
he's
participating.
now,
you
suggest
that
there
was
silence--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--yes,
exactly.
here
--
the
fact
pattern
here
is
he
did
not
say
"i
am
unwilling
to
waive,
i
do
not
wish
this
interview
to
go
forward.
"
he
doesn't
do
that.
he
just
doesn't
assert--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--butler
states
that
where
there
was
silence
after
the
provision
of
the
miranda
warnings,
silence,
that
where
the
subsequent
conduct,
where
knowing
reception
of
rights
and
the
course
of
conduct
indicates
waiver--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--i
understand
that's
the
facts
of
butler.
but
the
standards
by
which
all
the
courts
are
operating,
including
the
michigan
court,
are
the
standards
articulated
by
butler.
butler
says
that
the
waiver
can
be
inferred
from
the
words
and
actions
of
the
person
interrogated,
indicating
that
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no,
because
there
could
have
been
actions
taken
by
the
police
during
the
course
of
this
interview.
there
were
no
threats.
there
were
no
improper
promises.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
mr.
thompkins--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--i
think
that
that
kind
of
cuts
to
the
nub
of
what
miranda
says.
miranda
says
that
ultimately
the
statement
has
to
be
the
free
election
of
the
suspect.
and
here
when
mr.
thompkins
answered
the
series
of
questions,
he
knew
that
he
didn't
have
to
answer
those
questions,
and
nothing
the
police
had
done
during
the
course
of
the
interview
had
undermined
the
provision
of
rights,
because
it's
those
two
aspects
which
are
the
core,
the
knowing
and
intelligent
and
when
it's
voluntary.
nothing
the
police
had
done
had
undermined--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--i
think
that's
right,
that
here
mr.
thompkins
at
any
point
could
have
said:
"i
want
to
stop"--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--it's
a--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--but
--
but
this
language
from
miranda
that
says
the
silence
of
the
accused
after
warnings
are
given
would
not
be
sufficient,
that's
right,
but
butler
then
fully
explained.
and
think
about
the
state
courts
are
coming
in
that
they
then
--
this
court
then
made
clear
that
even
silence
after
having
received
miranda
warnings
--
that
if
you
knowingly
receive
your
rights
and
there
is
a
course
of
conduct
that
indicates
waiver,
that
there
can
be
a
waiver.
that's
exactly
what
the
federal
courts
have
done
on
direct
review.
now,
thinking
about
the
michigan
courts
and
trying
to
determine
what's
--
how
these
rules
are
to
be
applied,
the
federal
courts
have
found,
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver,
where
a
suspect
knowingly
receives
his
rights
and
then
answers
questions
implicating
himself,
that
the
answers
themselves
can
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
finding
of
a
waiver.
that's
what
the
--
the
conclusion
that
mr.
thompkins
waived
here
is
a
reasonable
one.
it's
not
objectively
unreasonable.
and,
of
course,
you
have
to
recall
the
overarching
habeas
law
that
governs
this,
that
not
just
does
a
michigan
court
decision
have
to
be
incorrect,
it
has
to
be
objectively
unreasonable.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
yes,
there
is
a
difference,
that
here
mr.
thompkins
did
not
assert
his
right.
he
did
not--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no,
because
at
the
point
--
the
point
at
which
mr.
thompkins
waived
is
when
he
acts
inconsistent
with
the
exercise
of
his
rights.
when
he
answers
questions
knowing
that
he
doesn't
have
to
answer,
that
is
the
waiver.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
before
--
in
that--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
so
what
happens
is
he
has
not
waived
and
he
has
not
invoked.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
he
has
does
neither.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
and
there's
nothing
--
the
way
the
miranda
rule
works
is
that
the
waiver
is
a
--
is
a
prerequisite
for
the
--
for
admission
of
the
evidence,
but
not
for
the
interrogation
itself.
so
what
happens
is
the
--
well,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
well,
i
think
miranda
itself
contemplates
pre-waiver
interrogation.
if
you
look
at
page
14
of
the
--
of
the
reply
brief,
the
yellow
brief,
and
the
quote
from
miranda
talking
about
the
processes
is,
on
page
14,
"once
warnings
have
been
given,
the
subsequent
procedure
is
clear.
"
"if.
"
--it's
on
page--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--page
14
on
the
left
side
in
the
middle.
it's
a
block
quote
from
miranda.
this
is
miranda's
description
of
the
processes:
"once
warnings
have
been
given,
the
subsequent
procedure
is
clear.
"
"if
the
individual
indicates
in
any
manner
at
any
time
prior
to
or
during
questioning,
that
he
wishes
to
remain
silent,
the
interrogation
must
cease.
"
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
right.
but
then--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--but
here
mr.
thompkins
answered
a
series
of
questions
knowing--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
he
--
that's
what
the
federal
courts
have
done
on
direct
review
--
this
is
what
cardwell
did,
and
there
are
five
or
six
circuits
have
found
the
answers
to
the
questions
themselves
can
be
the
best--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--when
he
answered
those
questions,
because
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no,
because--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--the
--
that's
what
the
federal
courts
have
done
in
applying
butler,
because
the
words
and
actions
of
the
person
interrogated
can
give
rise
to
the
inference
that
the
person
has
waived.
where
the
person
has
taken
action
that's
inconsistent
with
the
exercise
of
his
rights,
it
is
proper
to
find
waiver.
the
--
this--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
right.
that
this
--
so
if
you
look
at
the
implication
analysis,
did
he
make
it
clear
that
i
don't
want
to
participate
in
this
interrogation?
detective
helgert's
testimony--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
what
happens,
though,
in
davis,
this
court
made
clear
for
the
purpose
of
invocation,
that
the
invocation
has
to
be
unambiguous
because
the
police
have
to
know
when
they
have
to
cut
off
their
questioning.
the
--
so,
if
it's
ambiguous,
it's
ultimately,
for
the
question
of
invocation,
his
burden
to
assert
the
right
to
take
an
affirmative
action
to
show,
i
don't
want
to
answer
any
questions.
detective
helgert
believed,
through
his
limited
responses,
the
give
and
take
of
part
of
this
interview,
that
he
was
a
willing
participant
in
the
interview.
this
is
the
factual
record
that
was
established
by
the
state
courts.
it's
important
to
remember
that
this
case
being
reviewed
in
habeas
that
those
factual
determinations
are
entitled
to
deference
unless
disproven.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
thank
you.
