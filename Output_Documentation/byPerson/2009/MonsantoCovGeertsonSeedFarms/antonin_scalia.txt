out.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
robbins,
can
i
ask
you
about
your
clients'
standing?
what
individual
plaintiff
here
stood
to
be
harmed
by
what
the
agency
had
done?
which
one
of
them
was
--
was
within,
what,
5
miles
of
any
--
any
field
of
the
genetically
engineered
alfalfa?
justice
antonin
scalia
what?
from
what?
from--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
somebody
within
5
miles,
10
miles,
20
miles?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
want
the
court
to
assume
that
somebody
is
going
to
be
planting
a
field
of
the
genetically
engineered
alfalfa
within,
what,
5
miles
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
of
your
named
plaintiffs?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fact
is
there
isn't
a
single
named
plaintiff
who
--
who
has
--
has
any
claim
that
within
the
utmost
limits
of
--
of
risk,
he
is
at
risk
currently.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
you
have
to
bring
in
a
member
from
that
organization--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
is
concretely
harmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
don't
think
the
free
market
would
produce
companies
that
advertise:
we
only
cut
natural
seed
fields?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that
would
happen?
i
am
sure
it
would
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
really
losing
you
now.
i
thought
he
was
referring
to
the
number
of
farmers
who
would
be
planting
and
harvesting
genetically
engineered
alfalfa.
isn't
that
--
farmers
who
wanted
to
do
it.
he
was
saying:
we
now
have
200,000;
we
are
going
to
have
a
million.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
acreage,
whatever.
he's
talking
about
acreage
of
farmers
who
plant
and
want
to
plant--
justice
antonin
scalia
--genetically
engineered
seed.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
talking
about
how
many
unwilling
farmers
are
going
to
have
infected
fields.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure
we
understood.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
pretty
doggone
imminent
if
the
agency
has
come
before
the
court
and
said:
this
kind
of
partial
deregulation
ought
to
be
allowed,
and
we're
in
favor
of
it.
i
mean,
you
are
not
sending
it
back
to
an
agency
that's
a
blank
slate.
you
know
that
the
agency
favors
this
degree
of
deregulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
--
i'd
--
you
know,
i
--
boy,
i'd
take
a
remand
to
the
agency
any
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
contamination
of
the
new
york
city
water
supply.
it's
the
creation
of
plants
of
--
of
genetically
engineered
alfalfa
which
spring
up
that
otherwise
wouldn't
exist.
it
doesn't
even
destroy
the
current
plantings
of
non-genetically
engineered
alfalfa.
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
world.
it
really
isn't.
the
most
it
does
is
make
it
difficult
for
those
farmers
who
want
to
cater
to
the
european
market,
which
will
not
accept
genetically
engineered
alfalfa.
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
have
a
field
of
100
percent
non-genetically
engineered.
but
that's
not
the
end
of
the
world,
mr.
robbins.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
comparing
it
to
new
york
city
dying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
poisoned
water?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
happened
with
corn?
you
--
you
--
you
said
--
gee,
i
was
unaware
--
i've
been
eating
corn
all
this
time.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happened
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
--
we
don't
necessarily
have
to
do
that.
we
just
have
to
decide
whether
the
lower
courts
did
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
we
concluded
that
they
didn't
do
it,
that
would
--
that
would
be
enough,
wouldn't
it?
we
wouldn't
have
to
do
it
ourselves.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
also
said
stuff
which
suggests
that
they
didn't
do
it.
