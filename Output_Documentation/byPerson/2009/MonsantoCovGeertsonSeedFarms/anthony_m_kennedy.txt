justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
it
your
position
that
that
gives
you
the
hook,
the
entry
point,
for
saying,
well,
now
the
district
judge
didn't
just
replicate
in
all
respects
the
universe
without
the
regulation;
it
had
some
specific
injunctive
relief,
and
it
didn't
go
far
enough?
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
your
view
the
correctness
of
that
ruling
has
been
preserved
in
the
questions
presented
to
this
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
litigated
the
injunction
was
that
by
its
terms
and
because
of
its
issuance
the
agency
on
remand
could
not
have
adopted
some
partial
measures
to
allow
controlled
planting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
no,
but
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
reason
that
the
manufacturers,
monsanto,
contested
the
injunction?
they
said
--
because
once
the
injunction
is
issued,
as
the
government
has
told
us
today,
they
cannot
issue
some
partial
regulatory
scheme
with
--
with
safeguards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
--
but
that
is
substantial.
it
takes
time,
and
the
district
court
injunction
that's
now
in
effect
prohibits
that.
and
they
have
standing
to
challenge
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
at
least
that's
their
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
deciding
irreparable
harm,
what
weight
if
any
should
be
given
to
the
proposition
that
there
was
an
environmental
impact
regulation
violation,
as
opposed
to
just
a
regular
suit
between,
say,
two
farmers
over
a
nuisance?
what
weight
do
we
give
to
the
fact
that
--
let's
assume
--
there's
a
--
a
violation
of
the
rule
requiring
an
environmental
impact
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
not
alone
a
sufficient
harm
to
justify
an
injunction,
is
it?
