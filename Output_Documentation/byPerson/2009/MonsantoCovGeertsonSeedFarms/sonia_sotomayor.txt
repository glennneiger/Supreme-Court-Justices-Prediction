justice
sonia
sotomayor
however,
you
haven't
in
your
brief.
didn't
you
say
you
weren't
challenging
the
vacating
order?
you
keep
saying
--
i
know
you
appealed
it
originally,
but
the
point
is
that
you
didn't
seek
certiorari
on
that
ground.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
whose--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
you
tell
me
what's
the
legal
error?
you
started
by
identifying
the
first
one,
which
was
short-circuiting
the
irreparable
harm.
this
seems
more
like
factual
correction
which
you're
getting
into.
put
it
into
a
legal
box
for
me.
what
are
your
legal
claims?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
go
to
the
second
part
of
justice
alito's
question,
which
was
the
issue
of
standing,
both
yours
and
the
petitioners'.
what
is
it
exactly
that
we're
being
asked
to
review?
obviously,
you're
going
ahead
with
the
eis.
you
haven't
sought
a
stay
of
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
what's
the
basis
of
the
challenge
to
the
injunction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
have
--
let's
just
--
if
this
had
--
if
the
order
had
vacated
the
deregulation
and
sent
it
back
to
you,
what
would
you
have
--
the
agency
have
had
to
do
to
issue
temporary
regulations
consistent
with
the
ones
you
proposed
to
the
district
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
short-circuited
that.
isn't
this
more
akin
to
you
seeking
a
stay
of
the
vacating
order?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
district
court
vacated
the
deregulation.
no
one
can
plant.
you
and
the
petitioners
go
into
court
and
say
to
the
court:
stay
that
deregulation
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
planting.
aren't
you
the
one
seeking
the
stay?
and
if
so,
isn't
it
your
burden
to
show
that
you're
entitled
to
whatever
it
is
you
seek?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
the
legal
error
you
identify?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
little
different
than
answering
justice
kennedy's
question,
which
is:
did
you
preserve
the
issue
that
the
district
court
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
in
stopping
you
from
further
deregulation?
that's
a
different
question
than
whether
or
not
it
should
have
granted
your
further
injunction
which
is,
according
to
you,
a
further
deregulation.
but
it's
a
different
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
am
i
factually
correct
that
the
harm
is
that
from
some
seed-grown
alfalfa,
a
bee
or
the
wind
is
going
to
take
the
pollen
and
put
it
into
a
conventional
field?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
is
that
--
am
i
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
states
grow
alfalfa
to
seed
as
opposed
to
letting
it
just
grow
into
hay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
handful
of
states--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
that
where
the
risk
exists?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
just
said
the
word
"different
levels
and
different
degrees",
but
this
is
an
all-size-fit
injunction.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
is
that
reasonable
when
the
risk
is
different
depending
on
the
place
and
type
of
growth?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you
something?
is
that
because
your
farmers
--
i
understood
farmers
of
hay
had
huge
tracts
of
land.
do
they
rent
equipment
from
someone
else
to
do
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me,
could
you
tell
me,
just
to
clarify
one
factual
matter,
the
popularity
of
corn
and
the
other
genetically
engineered
crops,
is
that
from
contamination
or
is
it
just
from
--
from
consumer
choice;
i.e.,
that
that's
what
farmers
like
because
it's
easy
to
grow?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
a
real
problem
if
the
whole
appeal
is
over
whether
or
not
the
district
court
should
have
accepted
the
agency's
views.
the
agency
has
told
us
that
it
has
side-stepped
going
through
all
of
the
regular
--
all
of
the
administrative
steps
it
was
required
to.
it
may
not
have
needed
to
give
notice,
but
it
needed
to
do
some
form
of
an
ea
and
get
comments
and
do
other
things.
and
it
didn't
do
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
can
we
say
that
the
district
court
acted
improperly,
when
it's
the
government
who
is
asking
the
district
court
to
forgive
it
from
doing
something
it's
legally
required
to
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
my
problem
is
i
don't
see
that
argument
either
in
your
brief
or
theirs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
see
only
the
argument
that
it
erred
by
not
accepting
something
that
the
government
had
no
power
to
do
outside
of
the
regulatory
scheme.
