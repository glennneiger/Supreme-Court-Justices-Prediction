mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
biotech
crops
have
produced
enormous
benefits
for
the
nation's
farmers
and
consumers.
the
district
court
in
this
case
issued
a
broad-based
injunction
against
the
planting
of
a
highly
beneficial,
genetically
engineered
alfalfa
crop.
in
entering
and
sustaining
that
injunction,
the
courts
below
erred
in
two
fundamental
respects.
first,
they
short-circuited
the
requisite
inquiry
into
the
likelihood
of
reparable
--
irreparable
harm,
because
they
reasoned
that
the
agency
was
going
to
get
into
this
anyway
in
the
course
of
preparing
its
environmental
impact
statement.
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
court
shouldn't,
justice
alito.
first
as
to
the
vacatur,
we
appealed
the
judgment
that
contains
the
vacatur
and
the
injunction.
and
our
notice
of
appeal,
which
is
on
page
59
and
61
of
the
excerpts
of
record
in
the
ninth
circuit,
makes
clear
that
we
explicitly
appealed
the
vacatur
as
well.
and
let
me
explain
that
a
little
bit
more,
but
first
i
want
to
say
as
to
the
environmental
impact
statement,
the
government
can
address
that
more,
but
my
understanding
is
that
we're
probably
about
a
year
away
from
the
environmental
impact
statement.
this
case
presents
important
legal
issues
concerning
the
entry
of
injunctive
relief.
we
think
the
court
properly
granted
certiorari
and
should
decide
those
issues.
we
think
that,
although
the
record
is
large,
that
this
court
can
decide,
as
it
did
in
winter,
that
as
a
matter
of
law
this
record
does
not
support
a
finding
of
irreparable
harm--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
did
appeal
the
vacatur
as
well
as
the
injunction
which
is
contained
as
part
of
the
same
judgment.
we
know
that
the
district--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
--
our
argument
all
along,
justice
sotomayor
has
been
that
the
court,
the
district
court,
erred
in
not
adopting
the
government's
proposed
judgment.
if
you
look
on
page
184
of
the
petition
appendix,
that
proposed
judgment
makes
clear
that
it's
intended
to
replace
the
district
court's
judgment,
including
the
vacatur.
so
all
along
the
whole
argument
about--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
judgment.
it's
true,
a
vacatur
is
different
than
an
injunction.
but
here--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the
district
court
could
have
vacated
the
order
in
its
entirety
and
send
it
back
to
the
agency.
it
didn't
do
that.
it
not
only
went
ahead
and
enjoined
the
planting
of
rra,
roundup
ready
alfalfa,
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
vacatur
was
in
part.
we
know
that
because
the
district
court's
judgment
allowed
the
continued
planting
and
harvesting
of
roundup
ready
alfalfa,
the
planting
before
2007.
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well
--
and
importantly,
the
district
court's
judgment
--
and
it's
on
page
108
of
the
petition
appendix--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
only
enjoined
the
planting
of
roundup
ready
alfalfa,
it
enjoined
the
agency
from
taking
interim
measures.
it--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i'm
not
going
to
disagree
with
you
on
that.
it
is
important
that
they
enjoined
the
agency
from
implementing
the
very
proposed
measures
that
we're
now
finding
--
fighting--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
the
context
of
an
injunction.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
108a.
it's
108a
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
planting
was
allowed
until
march
30,
2007,
and
then
that
alfalfa
could
be
continued
to
be
harvested;
seeds
would
be
harvested
and
maintained
separately.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely.
that
in
combination
with
the
fact
that
it
actually
enjoined
the
agency
from
what
it
could
have
done,
otherwise
done,
under--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
weinberger
involved
at
least
an
analogous
situation,
where
the
court
found
a
statutory
violation
of
the
clean
water
act.
it
didn't
involve
the
vacatur
of
a
decision,
but
the
court
then
went
on
to
add
an
injunction
on
top
of
that.
so
you
had
the
statutory
violation
that
arguably
prohibited
the
conduct--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
we
at
the
outset
at
the
district
court
stage,
if
the
--
if
the
district
court
had
done
that,
that
would
have
been
fine.
it
could
have
gone
back.
the
agency
could
have
adopted
the
very
proposed
measures
that
we're
now
talking
about
in
the
context
of
an
injunction.
the
district
court
did
not
do
that.
it
entered
the
injunction
not
only
as
to
the
sale
of
rra,
but
as
to
the
agency
taking--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--those
interim
steps.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
we
know
the
district
court
didn't
mean
that
literally,
because
its
own
judgment
allows
the
continued
planting
and
harvesting
of
rra
planted
before--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--march
2007.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
if
it's
a
regulated
article,
then
there's
no
use
of
it
allowed
at
all
unless
the
agency
is
granting
exceptions.
so
the
district
court's
grant
of
that
exception
was
an
exercise
of
its
equitable
authority
in
the
context
of
considering
respondents'
injunction.
respondents
have
litigated
this
all
along
as
though
the
injunction
provided
something
in
addition
to
the
vacatur,
and
this
court's
cases
establish
that
the
injunction
is
an
extraordinary
and
drastic
remedy
that
does.
it
allows
people
to
go
into
court
to
enforce
it.
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
contempt
sanctions.
if
i
could
just
--
if
i
could
address
the
issue
of
irreparable
harm,
there
are
two
key
things
the
court
--
we
hope
the
court
will
understand
in
adjudicating
the
question
of
irreparable
harm.
first
is
you
need
to
separate
out
hay
production
and
seed
production.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
whatsoever
of
any
cross-pollination
from
rra
hay
fields
to
another
hay
field.
so
the
district
court's
injunction
applies
broad-based
to
hay
production
and
seed
production.
but
at
a
minimum,
we
think
you
have
to
take
seed
production
out.
the
next
thing
is
that,
when
it
comes
to
the
risk
of
harm--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--when
alfalfa
is
grown
for
hay,
for
forage,
as
opposed
to
grown
for
seeds
which
can
then
be
planted.
the
next
thing
to
know
is
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
risk
that
--
and
roundup
ready
alfalfa
will
appear
in
a
conventional
or
organic
alfalfa
field.
we're
not
talking
about
transforming
a
single
alfalfa
plant
in
the
country.
it's
the
risk
that
an
existing
alfalfa
plant
will
produce
a
seed,
which
will
then
produce
another
alfalfa
plant
which
would
be
a
roundup
ready
alfalfa
plant.
so
not
a
single
alfalfa
plant
in
this
country
is
going
to
be
harmed
by
the
addition
of
roundup
ready
alfalfa.
the
district
court
found,
on
page
43
of
the
petition
appendix,
that
roundup
ready
alfalfa
provides
no
harm
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--sure.
there's
three
legal
arguments
we
have,
justice
sotomayor.
the
first
is
the
district
court
short-circuited
the
whole
analysis
by
assuming
up
front
that,
since
this
was
going
to
go
to
environmental
impact
statement,
it
didn't
have
to
seriously
get
into
the
likelihood
of
irreparable
harm.
and
we
think
that
that's
clear
error
under
this
court's
amoco
decision.
and,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--federal
law
and
the
regulation
at
40
c.f.r.
1506.1(a)
allows
action
to
go
forward
where
there's
not
an
adverse
environmental
impact.
the
agency
has
explained
in
great
detail
in
declarations
that
allowing
the
very
limited
use
of
rra
under
the
restricted
conditions
of
the
proposed
injunctions
would
not
result
in
any
environmental
impact.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
kennedy,
to
answer
your
question,
this
court
in
amoco
held
that
you
don't
give
special
weight
to
that;
that
you
apply
the
traditional
equitable
factors.
your
honors,
we
absolutely
did
challenge
the
vacatur
below.
that's
spelled
out
in
note
1
of
our
reply
brief.
the
whole
fight
in
this
case
going
forward
since
the
district
court
has
been
over
whether
or
not
the
court
erred
in
not
adopting
the
government's
proposed
measures.
on
page
184
of
the
petition
appendix,
it
makes
clear
that
the
government's
proposed
measures
were
intended
to
replace
the
deregulation
order.
so
the
vacatur
and
the
proposed
measures
are
one
and
the
same.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
it--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
district
court
at
least
acted
improperly
in
enjoining
the
agency
from
doing
that
on
remand.
and
if
that's
all
the
court
thinks
it
did
improperly--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
it's
part--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
--
our
view
is
it's
part
and
parcel
of
the
vacatur
order.
the
district
court
looked
at
this
in
the
context
of
the
injunction
and
posed
those
traditional
factors
in
examining
the
scope
of
relief.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
mean,
it's
important
for
this
court
to
set
aside--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
terms
of
going
back
for
the
imminence,
we're
operating
under
this
injunction
which
is
unlawful.
it's
preventing
--
it's
causing
real
harm
to
the
nation's
farmers
today.
there
couldn't
be
more
imminence
in
terms
of
the
harm
that
we
suffer
because
of
this
erroneous
injunction.
with
respect,
it's
--
it's
the
farmers
that
are
challenging
this--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
you
go
back,
the
agency
could
allow
those
measures
to
be
implemented
and
that
would
solve--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--our
problem.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
not
necessarily,
justice
ginsburg,
but,
with
respect,
we've
been
operating
under
this
erroneous
injunction
for
3
years.
this
court
should
say
it's
erroneous.
there
are
other
cases
that
are
repeating
this
pattern.
it's
important
for
the
court
to
correct
this
error.
and
briefly
on
the
question
of
harm:
there
are
no
instances
in
this
record
of
any
cross-pollination
with
hay,
only
a
couple
of
--
a
few
isolated
with
respect
to
seed,
and
their
harm
really
boils
down
to
the
question
of
their
psychological
objection
to
genetically
engineered
alfalfa.
that
harm
is
not
cognizable
under
metropolitan
edison
or
anything
else.
thank
you,
your
honor.
