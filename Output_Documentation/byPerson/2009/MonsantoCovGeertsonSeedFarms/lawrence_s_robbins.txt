mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
petitioners
lack
standing
to
bring
this
case
to
this
court.
by
failing
to
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
the
deregulation
vacatur
either
in
the
ninth
circuit
or
in
this
court,
petitioners
have
an
insurmountable
redressability
problem.
they
cannot
get
the
practical
relief
they
seek
even
in
the
event
that
this
court
vacates
or
narrows
the
injunction,
and
that
is
because
the
vacatur
about
which
they
said
not
one
single
sentence
in
the
ninth
circuit
or
in
their
opening
brief
or
in
their
questions
presented
--
that
is
because
the
vacatur,
which
they
never
have
challenged,
had
the
unambiguous
effect
of
reregulating
rra.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
we're
--
we're
defending
it
on
the
alternative
ground,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
have
not
persuaded
you
on
our
threshold
question
that
there
--
that
there
is
a
lack
of
standing.
if,
for
--
i
mean,
they've
made
various
arguments
as
to
why
they
have
standing,
and
i'm
going
to
address
them
in
a
minute.
but,
you
know,
there's
always
a
chance
we're
going
to
lose
on
that
question--
[laughter]
--and
--
and
although
i
don't
think
we
ought
to,
we
thought
it
would
be
prudent
to
say
something
about
the
merits.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
the
answer
is
that
there
are
a
great
many
plaintiffs
who
put
in
declarations,
litigated
this
issue,
and
prevailed,
and
there
was
no
appeal
from
it.
for
example,
in
the
courtroom
today,
mr.
pat
trask
from
western
south
dakota,
a
hay
and
--
a
conventional
hay
and
seed
farmer,
who
alleged,
put
in
proof,
that
he
stood
--
if
the
deregulation
went
forward
without
any
injunction,
he
stood
to
--
a
risk
of
cross-pollination
and
contamination--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--from--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
we
have
to
be
clear,
your
honor.
what
--
what
--
what
was
enjoined
was
the
future
proliferation
of
this
product,
where
the
president
of
the
company
told
the
district
court:
if
you
let
us
continue
to
220,000
acres;
we
will
become
a
million
acres,
a
fivefold
increase.
and
that
was
on
the
assumption
that
the
eis
would
take
only
2
years.
it's
since
been
3
years,
and
now
i
hear
it's
going
to
be
a
fourth
year.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
let
me
be
clear.
we
have
organizational
clients
who
have
--
whose
members--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
and
we've
put
in
declarations
in
the
district
court,
multiple
declarations
from
those
members
and
from
mr.
geertson,
the
seed
--
conventional
seed
farmer
from
idaho,
and
mr.
trask
from
south
dakota.
but,
your
honor,
let
me
--
let
me,
without
begging
the
question
--
i
actually
think
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that
is
one
of
the
risks.
but
what
makes
this
case--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
one
of
the
risks
is
cross-pollination--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--most
of
the
seed
production
is
in
the
--
is
in
the
pacific
northwest
and
the
west.
there's
a
handful
of
states.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
oh,
no,
no.
the
risk
was
demonstrated
at
different
levels
and
to
different
degrees
both
in
the
hay-producing
states
and
in
the
seed-producing
states.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
because,
as
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
there
are
different
kinds
of
risks.
and
i
am
happy
to
turn
to
the
irreparable
harm
point,
your
honor,
of
the
proposition
that
the
risk
must
be
sufficiently
likely,
which
by
the
way,
does
not
mean
more
likely
than
not,
a
suggestion
made
in
the
reply
brief.
no
court
has
ever
said
so.
"sufficiently
likely"
talks
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
harm.
here,
whether
you
are
growing
hay
or
whether
you
are
growing
alfalfa
for
seed,
there
is
a
sufficiently
likely
risk
not
only
of
cross-pollination
or
all
the
other
ways
that
contamination
happens
--
through
dropping
seeds,
through
seed
mixing,
through
custom
cutting,
through
missing
ends
of
fields--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--they
often
do.
there's
custom
cutting
where
you
can't
--
you
know,
you
don't
own
the
equipment.
you
hire
a
custom
cutter
who
may
be
cutting
an
rra
field
today
and
your
field
tomorrow.
and
the
--
the
risk
--
and
this
is
all
in
the
record
--
the
risk
of
a
seed
contaminating
another
seed
or
getting
into
a
hay
field
is
easily
sufficiently
likely
to
not
constitute
an
abuse
of
discretion--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
the
--
well,
the
record,
justice
scalia,
before
the
district
court
does
not
tell
us
one
way
or
the
other,
but
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think
it's
relevant
to
one
of
the
categories
of
harms
that
we
think
is
cognizable
for
purposes
of
an
injunction,
and
that
is
the
effect
on
consumer
choice
and
producer
choice
to
be
in
a
non-gmo
business.
and--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--oh,
it's
--
it's
--
not
only,
justice
ginsburg,
is
it
not
pulled
out
of
thin
air,
we're
taking
their
word
for
it.
their
president,
fgi's
president,
said:
we
anticipate
a
fivefold
increase
from
220,000
acres
to
a
million.
and
that
was
on
the
premise
that
the
eis
was--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
from
a
range
of
contaminating
sources.
it's--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
no;
i'm
talking
about
acreage,
justice
scalia.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
i
--
i
understand.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
but
the
--
but
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--but
i
took
--
i
took
justice
ginsburg's
question
to
be
asking:
what
was
the
--
the
relevant
risk
that
the
district
court
had
to
consider
for
purposes
of
irreparable
harm?
and
certainly
one
factor
which
powerfully
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
court's
decision
in
winter
is
that,
whereas
the
navy
had
been
running
these
exercises
for
some
40
years
and
there
was
a
well-developed
track
record
as
a
consequence,
here
this
is
a
new
technology
that
was
about
to
spread
at
least
fivefold
over
2
years.
but
i
--
i
do
want
to
get
back
to
the
--
to
what
i
think
is
the
insurmountable
problem
that
the
--
that
the
petitioners
have
on
the
issue
of
standing,
because
i
heard
mr.
garre
say
this
morning
in
answer
to
one
of
the
court's
questions
that
the
--
that
the
notice
of
appeal
recited
the
vacatur
as
part
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
that
is
true.
that
is
because
the
notice
of
appeal,
like
most
notices
of
appeal
that
lawyers
file,
simply
quoted
the
judgment.
but
when
you
get
to
the
papers
--
the
briefs,
the
questions
presented,
the
argument,
the
oral
argument,
the
questions
presented
in
this
court,
the
opening
brief,
there
is
not
a
single
word
saying
that
the
vacatur
was
wrong.
and
that's
important
because,
as
i
believe
the
chief
justice
was
adverting
before,
the
vacatur
does
not
--
is
not
governed
by
the
same
injunctive
standards.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
--
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
some
considerable
force
to
the
point
that
the
injunction
in
that
respect
exceeded
the
scope
of
the
vacatur.
and
it
may
be
--
it
may
be
that
they
have
standing
only
to
challenge
so
much
of
the
injunction
as
exceeds
the
scope
of
the
vacatur,
but
that's
not
what
they
want.
what
they
want
is
to
do
all
the
planting
that
the
vacatur
says
they
may
not.
and
so
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
would
put
it
slightly
differently.
[laughter]
i
would
say
that
the
mistake
that
was
made
was
in
not
appreciating,
though
it
was
called
to
his
attention
by
the
lawyers
i
--
by
the
party
i
represent,
that
the
vacatur
did
have
this
effect.
i
do
think
that
the
injunction
was
sort
of
allowed
to
be
litigated.
there
were
many
reasons
why
they
litigated
the
injunction.
we,
for
example,
wanted
a
more
demanding
injunction--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
that
is
a
reason
why
my
clients
sought
the
injunction.
they
sought
--
they
sought
other
things
in
the
injunction
as
well,
but--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--there
is
--
that's
doubtless
one
reason
why
they
litigated
the
injunction,
but
it
is
not
a
reason,
justice
kennedy,
that
they
have
standing,
because
vacating
the
current
injunction
will
give
them
nothing
that
they
--
that
they
--
that
isn't
already
prohibited
by
the
vacatur,
except
--
and
i
grant
you
this
--
it
will
allow
them
to
go
back
to
the
agency,
seek
a
partial
deregulation,
which
mr.
stewart
told--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i'm
not--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that
is
their
argument,
but
it
isn't
right,
and
here's
why:
one
of
the
standing
requirements
is
imminence,
that
it
must
be
an
actual
harm
or
an
imminent
harm.
now,
here
are
the
things
that
would
have
to
happen
for
that
scenario
to
come
to
pass:
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
agency.
mr.
stewart
told
us
this
morning
there
would
have
to
be
at
least
an
environmental
--
an
ea
prepared,
that
may
or
may
not
come
out
in
favor
of
a
partial
deregulation.
there
would
then
be--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
we
don't
know.
i
heard
mr.
stewart,
who
speaks
for
the
government,
tell
us
that
it
would
require
additional
steps.
but
this
court's
imminence
cases,
you
know,
can't
--
do
not
accommodate
this
many
if's.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
right.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
can
--
i
can
tell
you,
your
honor,
maybe
the
best
authority
i
could
give
you
on
how
imminent
this
is,
how
--
whether
it
really
meets
this
court's
standings
tests,
here's
what
petitioners
said
about
this
exact
scenario
when
they
were
in
the
court
of
appeals:
they
said
that
the
prospect
of
a
future
grant
of
partial
deregulation
is,
quote,
nepa
controversy>
["],
end
quote,
that,
quote,
"rests
upon
contingent
future
events
that
may
not
occur
as
anticipated
or,
indeed,
may
not
occur
at
all.
"
i
take
that
to
be
the
very
definition
of
what
is
not
imminent
for
purposes
of
this
court's
standing
cases.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
--
i
--
you
know,
i
think
the
--
the
answer
is
contextual,
but
in
this
context,
mr.
chief
justice,
has
i
think
never
been
understood
to
mean
more
likely
than
not.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
but
there
are
cases
--
i
mean,
the
issue
has
not
been
addressed
by
this
court
one
way
or
the
other.
i
would
say
city
of
los
angeles
v.
lyons
and
the
amoco
case
both
used
the
phrase
"sufficiently
likely",
and
the
lower
courts
have
understood
that
to
mean
sufficiently
likely
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
harm.
consider,
if
we
were
talking
about
the
probability
of
the
contamination
of
the
water
supply
of
new
york
city,
would
anybody
suppose
that
the
--
if
the
probability
were
10
percent
rather
than
50.9
percent,
that
no
one
could
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction?
neither
the
private
litigants
--
you
know,
put
them
to
one
side.
the
government's
own
authority
to
obtain
injunctive
relief
would
be
critically
hampered
if
such
an
order
came
about,
and--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
don't
think
we
bore
the
burden,
an
end-of-the-world
burden,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
we
bore
the
burden
to
show
sufficient
evidence
of
irreparable
harm
such
that,
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
it
was
appropriate.
but
let
me--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no.
no,
i
was--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
--
i
thought
--
i
--
it
had
been
my
--
my
--
it
had
been
my
purpose
to
simply
try
to
suggest
that
it
does
not
make
sense
to
adopt
a
"more
likely
than
not"
standard
for
likelihood
of
success
or
likelihood
of
irreparable
harm.
but
i
do
--
if
i
could
come
to
your
honor's
question
about
what
the
harm
really
is,
there
are
three
types
of
harms.
there
is
the
contamination
of
products,
and
we've
talked
about
that.
but
there
are
two
things
we've
not
talked
about.
one
of
them
is
the
choice
to
be
in
a
line
of
business
that
farmers
and
businessmen
across
this
country
have
chosen
to
be
in.
some
of
them
are
in
this
courtroom
today.
they
have
chosen
organics
or
conventional
farming
that
is
gmo-free.
they
have
chosen
to
sell
natural
beef.
and
they
have
chosen
this
in
a
rapidly
growing,
large
business
with
dollars
--
billions
of
dollars
at
stake.
you
mention,
for
example,
justice
scalia,
the
european
market.
that
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
the
japanese
will
not
take
--
which
take,
by
the
way,
75
percent
of
our
alfalfa
exports
--
will
not
--
despite
their
formal
government
policy,
will
not
take
gmo
products--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
history
remains
to
be
written
about
what
will
happen
in
response
to
that
draft
eis
that's
a
year
away.
we'll
see
how
it
comes
out.
but--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes,
it's
very
popular,
but
it's
also
--
you
know,
past
is
prologue.
we've
seen
what
happened
with
genetically
engineered
corn.
you
can
ask
taco
bell--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
i
understand.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
there's
--
there
was
the
so-called--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--there
was
the
so-called
starlink
controversy
in
which
there
was
genetic
contamination
of
corn.
there
was
genetic
contamination
of
organic
soybeans
and
organic
canola
in
canada.
there
was.06
percent
contamination
of
--
of
--
of
rice
from
genetically
engineered
rice
that
nearly
--
that
--
that
cost
the
rice
industry,
as
the
rice
growers'
brief
makes
clear
--
the
amicus
brief
makes
clear.
the
fact
is
the
judge
had
before
him
all
of
this
evidence,
and
he
said
it
is
sufficiently
likely
to
--
to
constitute
irreparable
harm.
now,
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
correct
that
the
draft
eis
says
this
is
coming.
so,
in
a
year,
6
months,
whenever
it
is,
people
may
have
to
get
ready
for
a
brave
--
for
a
--
for
a
different
world
if
not
a
brave
new
world.
but
it's
worth
looking
at
that
draft
eis,
because
it
is
very
candid
about
how
different
the
world
will
look.
it
tells
us
we
know
this
is
going
to
shut
down
the
--
the
export
market.
we
know
that
the
japanese
and
the
koreans
and
the
europeans
won't
buy
your
products.
we
know
this
will
hasten
the
consolidation
of
farming.
we
know
it
will
hasten
the
--
it
will
hasten
the
demise
of
organic
farming,
a
rapidly
developing
business
in
this
country--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
indeed--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
--
i
agree
that
there
is
a
respect
in
which
the
injunction
goes
beyond
the
vacatur,
and
i
think,
you
know,
there
are
arguments
why
the
district
court
took
that
additional
measure.
but
i
--
i
think
the
upshot
is
that
if
that
is
the
only
respect
that
the
injunction
exceeds
the
limit
of
the
vacatur,
i
don't
understand
how
the
petitioners
can
possibly
have
standing
to
argue
all
the
things
that
they
argue,
which
is:
we
want
to
plant
tomorrow.
we
want
to
plant
the
next
day.
we
don't
want
to
have
to
go
back
before
the
agency
and
let
them
do
another
ea.
we
don't
want
to
have
more
litigation
over
a
partial
deregulation.
we
want
to
plant
now.
that's
their
argument
before
this
court.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
vacatur
tells
them
independently
they
may
not
do,
and
they
didn't
challenge
that.
they
didn't
and
they
haven't.
they
didn't
say
a
word
until
we
brought
it
up
in
our
bottom-side
brief.
then
we
heard
about
it.
and,
justice
kennedy,
this
is
precisely
the
situation
that
was
before
this
court
in
renne
v.
--
the
california
constitutional
provision--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--in
which
your
honor
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court.
where
there
are
overlapping
provisions,
or
for
--
you
know,
two
pieces
of
law
that
have
overlapping
effect,
and
you
challenge
one
but
not
the
other,
you
have
a
fatal
redressability
problem.
that's
where
we
are
today.
and
i
have
not
heard
--
i
mean,
i
understand
that
the
vacatur
was
perhaps
only
in
part
because
the
judge
in
his
discretion
grandfathered
certain
pre-march
30
growers
--
fine.
maybe
it
was
there
for
a
partial
vacatur.
but
whatever
form
of
the
vacatur
it
was,
they
didn't
challenge
it.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
injunction
is
based
on
the
vacatur.
but
i
do
want
to
--
i
do
think,
though,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
every
appeal
is
from
a
judgment.
i
mean,
that's
more
or
less
--
excepting
unusual
circumstances,
that's
the
only
thing
you
can
appeal.
but
if
i
were,
for
example,
appealing
a
criminal
conviction,
a
judgment
of
conviction
entered
and
sentence,
and
i
raised
only
evidentiary
arguments,
and
i
fail
to
raise
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
i
--
i
can't
get
a
dismissal
in
the
court
of
appeals,
because
i
have
--
i've
failed
to
raise
an
issue.
and
it
will
not
avail
me
one
whit
to
tell
the
court
of
appeals,
well,
gosh,
i
appealed
the
judgment,
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
embedded
in
the
judgment.
no.
the
way
we
appeal
things
in
this
country
is
we
write
sentences
in
our
briefs
about
--
we
write
questions
presented;
we
present
questions
to
this
court.
and
i
will
say
that,
although
all
manner
of
arguments
have
been
smuggled
under
the
tent
through
the
camel's
nose
in
this
case,
when
i
look
at
the
questions
presented
in
this
case,
you've
got
to
really
squint
to
find
even
some
of
the
arguments
they
have
made,
much
less
this
one,
which
they
have
not
made.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
i
think
what
we
--
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
relief
that
they
are
seeking
is
separately
prohibited
by
the
vacatur
and
whether
that
excess,
which
may
arguably
go
beyond
the
vacatur,
is
sufficiently
imminent
to
meet
this
court's
standing
cases.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
that
was
an
available
option.
i
think
the
reason
he
didn't
is
that,
among
other
things,
the
--
the
parties
were
arguing
about
whether
the
--
the
injunction
should
be
broader
than
the
vacatur.
and,
of
course,
he
had
the
authority,
as
the
government
has
told
us
in
its
brief,
to
decline
to
vacate
at
all.
so
it's
not
as
if
the
remedy
phase
had
no
point.
it
had
a
point.
it's
was
all
up
for
grabs.
but
in
the
end
he
issued
a
judgment
with
multiple
parts,
only
a
subset
of
which
petitioners
elected
to
appeal.
that
was
their
choice.
but
now
having
made
that
choice,
it
seems
to
me
surpassingly
odd
to
draw
this
court
into
a
close
reading
--
and
this
goes
back
to
one
of
the
first
questions
of
this
morning,
from
justice
alito
--
the
question
about
digging
into
this,
what
the
district
court
appropriately
called
the
voluminous
record
of
--
of
--
of
declarations
and
evidence.
that's
an
--
just
a
--
i
think
a
passingly
--
a
passing
strange
use
of
this
court's
resources,
to
dig
into
those
materials,
when
in
point
of
fact--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--respectfully,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
only
way
you
can
say
they
didn't
do
it
is
by
doing
it
yourself;
because
they
said
they
did
it.
you
look
at
pages--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
--
i
won't
--
and
i
am
not
here
defending
every
particular
line
in
some
of
the
opinions,
but
there
is
no
question
that
at
69a
through
71a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
district
court
articulated
the
standard
four-part
injunction
test.
the
court
of
appeals
articulated
it
as
well,
said
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient.
and,
indeed,
in
this
record,
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
a
finding
of
a
likelihood
of
irreparable
harm,
reviewable
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
your--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
--
i
--
i
think,
given
that
standing
is
a
threshold
question,
i
don't
see
how
the
court
could
do
that.
i
think
the
court
could
say:
we
conclude
that
the
vacatur
prohibits
exactly
the
same
things
as
the
petitioners
are
demanding
from
this
court.
they
didn't
challenge
it;
they
have
a
redressability
problem,
case
dismissed--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--or
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
the
government
--
well,
the
government
i
think
has
the
same
vacatur
problem,
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
burden
i
have
to
meet,
because
under
--
i
think
it's
diamond
v.
charles,
the
--
the
standing
has
to
be
by
the
party
that
called
upon
this
court's
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
it
--
it--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no.
and
no
--
no
one
is
claiming
that
an
eis
violation
standing
alone
gives
rise
to
an
injunction,
but
it
carries
some
important
weight.
and
if
i
could
just
answer
the
question
notwithstanding
the
red
light,
the
answer
to
the
question
is
the
fact
that
they
violated
the
eis
requirement
tells
us
at
a
minimum
that
this
was
a
significant
--
a
major
federal
program
that
had
a
significant
impact
on
the
environment.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you.
