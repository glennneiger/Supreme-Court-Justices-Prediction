justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
garre,
the
respondents
argue
that
we
should
dismiss
the
writ
here
as
improvidently
granted,
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
explain
why
that
isn't
the
preferred
course
of
conduct.
they
contend
that
when
this
was
before
the
ninth
circuit,
your
firm
could
have
but
did
not
contest
the
--
the
vacatur
of
the
aphis
deregulation
order.
it's
argued
that
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
likely
to
be
issued
very
soon,
or
fairly
soon.
maybe
the
solicitor
general
could
give
us
an
estimate.
if
we
agree
with
your
argument
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
the
wrong
preliminary
injunction
standard
and
remand
for
them
to
apply
the
right
preliminary
injunction
standard,
the
case
may
be
moot
by
the
time
they
do
that.
and
the
alternative
is
for
us
to
plow
into
the
extremely
fact-bound
question
whether
applying
what
you
contend
to
be
the
correct
preliminary
injunction
standard
of
relief
would
be
warranted
on
this
record.
in
light
of
all
that,
why
shouldn't
we
take
their
suggestion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
answer
mr.
robbins's--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i'm
sorry
to
interrupt.
how
do
you
answer
mr.
robbins's
imminence
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
involves
a
challenge
to
a
decision
by
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
to
deregulate
completely
a
particular
variety
of
genetically
engineered
alfalfa.
the
district
court
held
that
the
department
violated
the
national
environmental
policy
act
by
issuing
its
deregulation
decision
without
first
completing
a
detailed
assessment
of
the
decisions
likely
environmental
impact.
to
remedy
that
violation
the
district
court
vacated
the
agency's
decision
enjoined
the
agency
from
deregulating
the
alfalfa
in
whole
or
in
part
pending
completion
of
the
mandated
environmental
review
and
prohibited
virtually
all
planting
of
the
alfalfa
on
an
interim
basis.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
entry
of
permanent
injunctive
relief.
we
hold
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
enjoined
the
agency
from
affecting
any
deregulation
of
matter
how
limited
pending
its
environmental
review.
at
this
point,
we
do
not
know
whether
and
to
what
extent,
the
agency
will
seek
to
effect
a
partial
deregulation
if
it
is
free
to
do
so.
we
do
know
that
subject
to
certain
exceptions
not
relevant
here,
the
genetically
engineered
alfalfa
cannot
be
grown
or
sold
commercially
and
thus
poses
no
threat
to
the
environment
until
such
time
as
the
agency
issues
a
new
deregulation
decision,
and
we
also
know
that
if
and
when
the
agency
makes
such
a
decision
any
party
aggrieved
by
that
decision
may
file
a
new
suit
challenging
that
decision
and
seeking
appropriate
preliminary
relief.
because
it
was
premature
to
foreclose
even
the
possibility
of
a
limited
deregulation,
it
was
likewise
inappropriate
to
enjoin
any
and
all
parties
from
planting
the
alfalfa
in
accordance
with
such
a
deregulation
decision.
for
these
and
other
reasons
set
out
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
