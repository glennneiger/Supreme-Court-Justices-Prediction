justice

bader

but
winter
didn't
involve
something
--
as
i
understand,
the
--
the
decision
vacated
the
deregulation
order.
you
are
not
challenging
that.
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
there's
no
deregulation
decision
in
place,
then
we're
back
to
the
plant
protection
act,
and
there's
no
authorization
for
the
planting
of
these
crops.
so
as
long
as
you
haven't
challenged
the
vacation
of
the
deregulation
decision,
i
don't
see
how
there's
anything
for
us
to
deal
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
looking
at--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
looking
at
page
58a.
maybe
that
--
you
referred
to
what
as
the
district
court's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
i
thought
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
injunctive
provision
was
to
spare
the
people
who
had
already
purchased
seeds,
allowing
those
to
be
planted
until
march
30,
2007.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
garre,
i'm
looking
at
the
injunction,
and
it
says
that
the
deregulation
decision
is
vacated
and
roundup
ready
alfalfa
is
once
again
a
regulated
article.
we
could
simply
say
as
far
as
it
goes,
that's
all
right;
anything
else
is
surplusage.
we
take
it
to
be
the
judgment
that
roundup
ready
alfalfa
is
once
again
a
regulated
article,
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
i
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
was
just
a
dispensation
to
people
who
had
already
bought
the
seeds.
that
was
recognizing
that
they
had
incurred
an
expense,
that
they
were
all
ready
to
plant.
that
--
that
was
the
only
exception.
it
goes
back
to
the
status
of
a
regulated
article
with
this
one
exception.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
explain,
mr.
garre,
why
that's
so,
because
i
thought
that
the
federal
law
is
before
the
agency
engages
in
an
action
that
requires
an
eis,
it
has
to
do
the
eis?
so
this
unit
of
the
department
of
agriculture
violated
federal
law
by
deregulating
prior
to
the
completion
of
an
eis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
--
when
you
--
can
you
stop
right
there,
because
i
thought
the
law
was,
government
agency,
before
you
engage
on
a
major
activity,
eis
first,
and
then
you
can
have
a
deregulation
order?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
the
court
is
concerned,
it's
conceded
that
nepa
was
violated,
an
eis
was
required.
and
then
the
district
court
vacates
the
deregulation
decision.
i
thought
that,
under
the
apa,
at
that
point,
the
court
is
obliged
to
say,
well,
the
agency
engaged
in
conduct
that
was
not
in
accord
with
law,
and
so
we
send
it
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
--
would
you
agree
that
if
the
district
court
had
just
said
the
deregulating
decision
is
vacated
and
roundup
ready
alfalfa
is
once
again
a
regulated
article,
period,
that
would
be
okay?
and
you
would
have
no
basis
to
prevent
this
from
going
straight
back
to
the
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
all,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
district
court
did
do
in
addition
to
that
is
to
say
that
alfalfa
seeds
may
be
planted
--
alfalfa
seeds
that
are
--
that
have
already
been
purchased
may
be
planted
prior
to
march
30,
2007.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
only
exception.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robbins,
is
it
--
is
it
relevant
to
that,
that
in
the
case
of
other
genetically
engineered
crops
--
sugar
beets,
for
example,
soybeans
--
that
the
plantings
became
overwhelmingly
the
genetically
engineered,
rather
than
the
organic
or
natural?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
point
of
how
many
now,
how
many
at
this
moment?
but
you
projected
that
there
would
be
an
enormous
increase,
and
that
was
not
just
pulled
out
of
thin
air.
i
assume
it
had
something
to
do
with
what
happened
to
other
crops.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robbins,
but
if,
as
is
likely
--
i
think
the
government
told
us
that
the
eis
is
about
a
year
away,
but
that
the
eis
is
going
to
say
deregulate--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
going
to
recommend
a
deregulation
decision.
so
we're
talking
about
the
--
whatever
the
farmers
of
organic
or
conventional
--
they're
only
a
year
away
from,
so
they
will
have
to
accept
that
there
are
other
planters
who
want
to
do
the
genetically
engineered
crop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
you
yourself
told
us
how
it
came
out
with
other
crops,
that
the
genetically
engineered
crop
was
very
popular
and
took
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
it
be
the
same
problem
for
the
farmers
if
we
had
only
the
deregulation
decision
vacated?
they
can't
do
anything
until
the
agency
then
gives
them
permission
to
do
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
going
to
take
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
it's
going
to
take
time,
and
you
have
the
eis
on
track
within
a
year.
so
are
you
going
to
do
this
other
operation
in
6
months?
