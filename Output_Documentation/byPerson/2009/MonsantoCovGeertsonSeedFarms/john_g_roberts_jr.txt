chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
09-475,
monsanto
company
v.
geertson
seed
farms,
et
al.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
that
those
are
two
different
things,
then,
right?
the
vacatur
is
one
thing
and
the
injunction
is
another,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
under
the
vacatur,
the
normal
apa
remedy
is
a
remand
to
the
agency.
in
fact,
there
are
some
courts
that
say
you
can't
get
anything
else.
but
whether
you
can
or
can't,
it's
clear
that
the
burden
is
on
you
to
get
something
short
of
complete
remand.
the
burden
is
on
your
friends
to
get
--
establish
the
injunction.
the
problem
with
combining
the
two,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
you
are
imposing
on
them
the
burden
to
meet
the
injunction
standard
simply
to
get
a
remand
to
which
they
are
entitled
under
the
apa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
vacatur
does
that.
you
can't
plant
once
the
deregulation
order
is
vacated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
say
that
the
injunction
is
limited
only
to
a
decision
the
agency
might
make
to
allow
partial
planting?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
why
did
it
do
that?
i
mean,
the
way
the
apa
works,
this
is
sent
back
to
the
agency.
if
the
agency
wants
to
partially
deregulate,
it
can
do
it.
and
then
you
can
challenge
it
under
the
normal
apa
procedures.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
very
odd
to
get
an
injunction
to
an
agency
telling
them
they
can't
do
something
under
the
apa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
authority
do
you
have
for
the
proposition
that
when
a
court
vacates
an
administrative
order,
it
has
the
authority
to
tailor
an
injunction
rather
than
simply
remand
the
matter
to
the
agency?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
--
weinberger,
of
course,
involved
a
statute.
i
mean,
the
concern
is
that
the
authority
to
determine
how
far
to
go
in
deregulating
or
partial
deregulating
is
for
the
agency
to
make.
and
once
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
apa,
it
goes
back
to
the
agency.
what
the
district
court
did
here
was
assume
that
responsibility
itself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
the
burden
to
establish
your
entitlement
to
those
conditions
that
are
short
of
a
remand,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure,
sure.
agencies
can
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure,
because
--
but
here
the
question
is
whether
the
court
can
do
that.
the
court
is
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
the
agency.
and
i
would
say
it's
--
i
mean,
there's
authority
that
you
can't
do
that
at
all,
but
certainly
you'd
have
the
burden
to
establish
that
those
reliefs
short
of
remand,
that
you
are
entitled
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
short-circuiting
notice
and
comment
or
whatever
else
is
required,
the
reason
we
send
this
to
an
agency,
because
they
are
expert
and
all
that.
the
agency
is
acting
without
the
benefit
of
any
input
on
the
partial
deregulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
when
you're
talking
about
the
elements
of
the
injunction
that
are
short
of
remand
to
the
agency,
that
the
respondents
do
not
have
the
obligation
to
meet
the
injunction
standards
with
respect
to
those?
in
other
words,
it's
part
of
the
judgment.
it's
not
an
injunction,
and
you
have
the
burden
if
you
want
the
court
to
do
anything
other
than
send
it
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
to
the
--
about
the
types
of
activities
that
would
be
prohibited
if
the
court
just
remanded
it
back,
vacated
it,
which
is
everything
--
you
can't
plant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
my
point
is
they
don't
need
an
injunction.
the
thing
that's
bothering
me
is
you've
got
two
different
things,
the
vacatur
and
the
injunction.
and
it
seems
to
me
by
melding
them
together,
you're
trying
to
impose
the
burden
on
the
plaintiffs
to
meet
the
injunction
standard
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
vacatur.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
injunction
doesn't
do
anything,
why
are
you
bothering
to
defend
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt.
just
from
the
seeds
blowing
in
the
wind?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
--
there's
a
flip
side
of
that
that
is
not
so
good
for
you,
because
one
of
the
things
you
want
from
the
injunction
is
a
prohibition
on
the
agency
partially
deregulating.
well,
you're
not
entitled
to
that,
because
the
vacatur
sends
it
--
should
send
it
back
to
the
agency
and
they
can
decide.
and
if
they
decide
to
partially
deregulate,
you
have
the
apa
challenges
available
to
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
argument
is
that
the
district
court
judge
made
a
mistake
in
mixing
up
the
vacatur
and
the
injunction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
answer,
but
they've
already
done
an
ea
in
support
of
total
deregulation,
presumably,
and
they
found
no
adverse
--
presumably,
that
would
be
a
fortiori
for
partial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
go
back
to
something
you
said
a
while
ago,
that
"likely"
does
not
mean
more
likely
than
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
--
i
thought
that
would
be
obvious.
if
i
say
your
friends
are
likely
to
win,
that
means
they
are
more
likely
than
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
--
i
--
i
was
surprised
that
this
apparently
hasn't
been
decided
over
the
however
many
years
we've
had
this
standard.
is
there
a
case
that
says
"likely"
does
not
mean
more
likely
than
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
a
decision
for
the
government
to
decide,
aphis,
and
their
lawyer,
mr.
stewart,
who
is
in
the
courtroom
told
us
what
the
aphis
view
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
arguments
you
can
make
before
hp
--
aphis
and
which
presumably
were
made
before
aphis--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
can
be
made
before
aphis
if
this
is
remanded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
entitle
you
to
an
order
saying
aphis
can't
do
anything
in
the
meantime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
kind
of
artificial
to
separate
the
two
out.
i
mean,
it's
one
judgment,
and
they
say
they're
intertwined.
the
injunction
is
based
on
the
vacatur.
and
so
if
they
challenge
the
injunction,
you
can't
say,
well,
they're
not
challenging
the
vacatur.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
we
have
to
decide
--
for
you
to
prevail
on
that,
we
have
to
decide
that
the
injunction
does
no
more
than
the
vacatur.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
the
district
judge
was
wrong.
he
should
have
--
if
you
say
the
injunction
adds
nothing
to
the
vacatur,
he
should
have
ended
by
saying
it's
vacated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you're
--
if
you
are
right
that
the
injunction
does
nothing,
they
don't
have
standing
because
of
that,
we
should
throw
the
injunction
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
don't
have
to
worry--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
government
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
standing,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
garre,
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
case
09-475,
monsanto
company
versus
geertson
seed
farm.
