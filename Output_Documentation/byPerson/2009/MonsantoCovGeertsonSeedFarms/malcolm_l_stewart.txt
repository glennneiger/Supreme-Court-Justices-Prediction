mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
first
to
address
briefly
justice
alito's
question
about
the
length
of
time
that
the
agency
anticipates
the
eis
will
take.
the
agency
now
anticipates
that
its
best
estimate
is
that
the
eis
will
be
ready
approximately
a
year
from
now.
a
draft--
eis
has
been
submitted
for
public
comment.
the
public
comment
period
was
extended
until
early
march
of
2010.
the
agency
has
received
on
the
order
of
145,000
public
comments.
and,
so,
in
addition
to
parsing
through
those
and
seeing
which
of
them
need
to
be
responded
to,
the
agency
wants
to
consult
with
other
federal
agencies.
and,
so
this
process
is
going
to
take
longer
than
aphis
had
anticipated
at
the
outset.
now,
we
said
in
our
brief
in
opposition
that
the
fact
that
the
eis
process
was
ongoing
was
a
reason
for
this
court
to
deny
certiorari.
i
think
regardless
of
how
good
an
argument
that
was
at
the
cert
stage,
the
court
has
granted
cert,
and
we
think
that
the
court
should
decide
the
case.
there's
no
realistic
prospect
that
the
case
will
become
moot
before
this
court's
decision
is
rendered.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
when
the
district
court
issued
its
summary
judgment
ruling,
it
asked
the
parties
to
propose
their
own
forms
of
a
judgment.
and
aphis
might
have
done
what
the
chief
justice
suggested
ought
to
have
been
done;
that
is,
it
might
have
indicated
that
the
court
--
that
either
it
should
simply
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
or
that
it
should
vacate
the
deregulation
order,
and
the
matter
would
have
been
remanded
to
the
agency
to
decide
what
to
do
next.
and
if
that
had
happened,
the
agency
could
then
have
issued
an
administrative
order
that
embodied
the
same
proposed
conditions
that
were
embodied
in
the
injunction.
presumably,
the
plaintiffs
would
have
challenged
that,
and
we
would
have
had
a
new
lawsuit.
now,
what
aphis
tried
to
do,
in
essence,
was
to
streamline
the
process
by
combining
into
one
steps
that
could
otherwise
have
been
taken
separately.
and
it
proposed
an
injunction
that
said
the
deregulation
decision
is
vacated
and
replaced
by
the
following
protective
conditions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
our
burden;
that
is,
if
the
--
if
the
order
had
simply
been
--
the
deregulation
order
had
simply
been
vacated
and
remanded
to
the
agency,
and
the
agency
had
then
performed
the
analysis
that's
reflected
in
the
hoffman
declarations
and
said
we
are
putting
in
place
a
complete
deregulation--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--agencies
can
do
that.
and
it
--
on
review
of
that,
it
would
not
have
been
our
burden
to
establish
that
those--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
in
the
ordinary
course,
you're
absolutely
correct.
and
in
the
usual
case,
it's
an
important
principle
to
us
that
the
court
should
not
usurp
the
agency's
role.
here
i
think,
in
fairness
to
the
district
court,
if
the
court
had
issued
the
injunction
we
proposed
with
the
protective
measures
that
were
reflected
in
the
government's
proposed
judgment,
the
court
would
not
have
been
usurping
the
agency's
role,
because
it
would
have
been
adopting
the
very
protective
measures
that
the
agency
identified
as
appropriate.
so
we
think
that
the
district--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
is
certainly
acting
with
the
benefit
of
whatever
information
it
received
in
the
form
of
public
comment
in
its
original
environmental
assessment
for
the
complete
deregulation.
and
in
addition,
the
district
court,
in
deciding
whether
the
agency's
proposed
conditions
would
have
been
appropriate
could
have
entertained
comments
from
obviously
the
respondents
and
from
anyone
else
who
wanted
to
intervene.
but
to
go
back
to
justice
sotomayor's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--our
view
is
that,
first,
that
we
would
not
have
had
to
go
through
public
notice
and
comment,
because,
under
5
u.s.c.
553(b)(2),
there
is
an
exception
for
good
cause,
and
here
the
relatively
limited
timeframe
that
we
were
talking
about
in
our
view
would
have
constituted
good
cause.
obviously,
the
plaintiffs
might
have
challenged
that.
now,
we
would
have
had
to
perform
some
sort
of
environmental
analysis
to
comply
with
our
nepa
obligations
in
order
to
feel
sufficient
confident
--
confidence
that
implementation
of
our
proposed
measures
would
not
cause
significant
environmental
impacts.
it
wouldn't
have
had
to
be
an
eis;
that
is,
nepa
provides,
in
appropriate
circumstances--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
--
it
is
correct
to
say
that,
as
a
matter
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
an
agency
cannot
decide
to
prepare
an
eis
on
a
particular
act,
decision,
and
then
implement
that
very
decision
during
the
pendency
of
the
eis.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
our
--
our
core
point
here
is
that
what
we
were
proposing
for
the
interim,
that
is
allowing
continued
planting
subject
to
various
protective
measures,
was
fundamentally
different
from
the
action
on
which
the
eis
was
being
prepared.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--you
are
correct.
and
we
are
not
asserting
the
right
to
implement
the
deregulation
decision;
that
is,
the
decision
removing
all
federal
constraints
from
the
planting
and
harvesting
of
rra.
we're
not
asserting
the
right
to
do
that
during
the
pendency
of
the
eis
process.
the
ceq
regulations
speak
to
this
question,
and
they
don't
say
while
an
eis
is
ongoing,
no
activity
related
to
the
action
for
which
the
eis
is
being
prepared
may
go
forward.
they
say
in
the
interim
the
agency
can't
do
things
that
will
have
an
adverse
environmental
impact
or
will
foreclose
reasonable
alternatives.
so,
what
the
agency
might
have
done
at
the
outset
was
say:
we
need
to
do
an
eis
before
implementing
a
complete
deregulation
decision.
the
effects
of
doing
that
are
at
least
potentially
sufficiently
great
that
an
eis
is
being
prepared.
however,
we
feel
confident
that
interim
planting
during
this
limited
period,
subject
to
these
proposed
protective
measures,
will
not
have
adverse
environmental
impact--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
hope
i
didn't
misunderstand
the
question.
if
you're
referring
to
the
types
of
activities
that
would
have
been
prohibited
even
under
our
proposed
injunction;
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
think
in
order
for
the
--
the
plaintiffs
to
get
an
injunction
against
those,
they
would
have
had
to
meet--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
if
this
had
happened
through
the
alternative
events
--
course
of
events
that
i
discussed
previously;
that
is,
if
the
matter
had
been
remanded
back
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
had
issued
an
administrative
order
that
embodied
these
proposed
protective
conditions,
then
the
plaintiffs
would
presumably
have
either
filed
a
new
lawsuit
or
challenged
this
within
the
confines
of
this
suit.
the
burden
would
have
been
on
them
to
show
both
that
those
protective
measures
were--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
all
that
the
court
had
decided
up
to
the
point
when
we
submitted
our
proposed
judgment
was
that
an
eis
was
needed
before
the
agency
could
implement
complete
deregulation.
and
i
think
in
this
respect
the
case
is
similar
to
winter;
that
is,
in
winter
in
the
district
court
--
the
district
court
initially
imposed
six
restrictive
measures
on
the
navy,
and
the
navy
elected
not
to
challenge
four
of
them
but
challenged
the
other
two.
i
suppose
that
the
navy
could
have
asked
for,
in
a
sense,
vacatur
of
its
proposed
action
and
then
announced
a
new
action
that
consisted
of
compliance
with
the
four
unchallenged
restrictive
measures
and
noncompliance
with
the
other
two.
from
our
perspective,
rather
than
short-circuiting
the
process,
as
i
say,
we
were
trying
to
streamline
it;
that
is,
the
court
could
have
sent
it
back
to
us,
we
could
have
told
it
what
protective
measures
were
appropriate,
and
then
some
months
later
we
would
have
been
back
in
court
to
review
the
adequacy
of
those,
particularly
because
we
thought
of
the
--
any
injunction
as
being
something
that
would
stay
in
effect
only
for
the
relatively
limited
period
of
time
while
the
eis
was
being
prepared.
we
tried
to
speed
up
the
process
by
telling
the
court
in
advance
these
are
the
protective
measures
we
think
are
appropriate
without
the
need
for
a
remand.
and
the
court's
fundamental
error
was
in
equating
what
we
had
proposed
with
the
complete
deregulation
that
was
the
subject
of
the
lawsuit.
i
think
that
the
--
the
agency's
declarations
explained
why
the
protective
measures
that
were
embodied
in
the
government's
proposed
injunction
would
have
been
fully
sufficient
to
prevent
irreparable
harm
to
the
plaintiffs
during
the
pendency
of
the
eis--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
the
legal
error
we
identify.
we
also
think
that
the
district
court
did,
without
quite
using
these
words,
announce
a
presumption
in
favor
of
injunctive
relief;
that
is,
the
district
court
said,
wrongly
in
our
view,
that
it
couldn't
assess
the
adequacy
of
the
proposed
protective
measures
because
that
would
duplicate
the
analysis
that
was
going
on
in
the
eis.
we
think
that
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
district
court
could
have
done
that
and,
as
i
say,
if
--
if
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
didn't
just
say
that.
in
its
judgment,
which
i
believe
is
at
page
108a
of
the
petition
appendix
--
and
mr.
garre
referred
to
this
previously
--
it
said
in
addition
that
the
agency
is
enjoined
from
deregulating
even
in
part
genetically
engineered
alfalfa.
so
the
district
court
didn't
simply
vacate
the
--
the
deregulation
order
and
send
it
back
to
the
agency
to
decide
whether
some
interim
protective
measures
would
be
appropriate.
it
said
the
agency
can't
do
anything
while
the
eis
is
being
prepared
to
allow
the
planting
or
harvesting
of
rra
except
to
the
limited
extent
that
the
district
court
was
authorizing
with
respect
to
already
planted
alfalfa.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
i
think
--
yes,
i
think
absolutely.
because
the
fundamental
controversy
both
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
has
been
not
whether
an
injunction
should
have
been
entered
at
all.
for
better
or
for
worse,
i
think
both
the
petitioners
and
the
government
have
acquiesced
in
the
entry
of
some
form
of
injunction.
the
controversy
has
been,
should
the
district
court
have
entered
the
government's
proposed
injunction
instead
of
the
one
that
it
actually
entered?
and
clearly
if
the
proposed
injunction
had
been
entered
instead,
the
petitioners
would
have
been
better
off
because
there
would
have
been
a
continued
market
for
their
seed
to
planters
who
wanted
to
grow
rra
in
compliance
with
the
proposed
protective
measures.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
sure
to
what
extent
the
petitioners
or
--
or
the
government,
frankly,
have
focused
precisely
on
that
particular
language
of
the
district
court's
judgment.
but
it
has
certainly
been
kind
of
the
fundamental
basis
for
our
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
for
petitioners'
appeal
and
certiorari
petition
that
what
they
are
complaining
about
was
the
fact
that
a
complete
injunction
was
put
in
place,
instead
of
an
injunction
that
embodied
the
government's
proposed
protective
measures,
and
we
were
focusing
on
the
choice
between
two
injunctions.
we
didn't
focus
specifically
on
the
alternative
course
of
action
in
which
the
matter
might
have
been
sent
back
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
would
then
have
embodied
those
proposed
protective
measures
in
an
administrative
order.
but
i
think
the
issue
whether
those
protective
measures
would
have
been
sufficient
to
prevent
irreparable
harm
to
the
plaintiffs
has
been
preserved
throughout.
just
to
say
one
more
thing
about
the
ceq
regulations,
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
those
are
entitled
to
deference,
and,
again,
they
don't
preclude
all
action
during
the
pendency
of
the
eis.
