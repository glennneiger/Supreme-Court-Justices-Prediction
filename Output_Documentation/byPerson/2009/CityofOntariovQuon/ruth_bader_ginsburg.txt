justice

in
addition
to
--
that
was
said
at
the
meeting
--
and
lieutenant
duke,
who
was
the
same
one
who
later
says:
i'm
not
going
to
monitor
as
long
as
you
pay
the
difference.
there
was
the
statement
at
the
meeting
by
that
same
person.
wasn't
there
something
in
writing
by
the
police
chief
to
follow
up
after
that
meeting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then,
according
to
what
you
just
said,
the
jury
determination
was
superfluous.
if
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
the
officers
were
told
this
is
just
--
we
treat
this
just
like
e-mails,
it
can
be
monitored,
it
can
be
made
public,
then
there
would
be
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
and
there
would
be
no
question
to
go
to
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
take
it
that
the
stored
communications
act
does
say
that
the
provider
may
not
give
out
the
transcripts,
if
we
take
that
as
given,
then
how
can
the
department
lawfully
use
the
transcripts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
--
why
is
that
so?
i
mean,
it
did
say
associated
equipment.
and
--
and
if
an
employee
is
told
now
e-mails
aren't
private,
so
we're
warning
you,
we
can
monitor
them,
wouldn't
such
an
employee
expect
the
same
thing
to
apply
to
the
pager?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
question
is,
an
employee
reads
this
policy
and
says,
oh,
my
e-mails
are
going
to
be
subject
to
being
monitored--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wouldn't
that
employee
expect
that
the
policy
would
carry
over
to
pagers?
i
mean,
would
--
when
you
think
of
what's
the
reason
why
they
want
to
look
at
the
e-mails,
wouldn't
the
same
reason
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
he
said
--
he
was
saying:
but
as
far
as
billing
is
concerned,
i'm
not
going
to
look
at
these;
if
you
use
more
than
25,000
characters,
you
pay
the
extra,
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it.
if
you
contest
that,
then
i'll
look
to
see
whether
those
in
excess
of
25,000
characters
were
for
work
purposes
or
private
purposes.
and
so
he's
talking
about
the
billing.
he
hasn't
retracted
what
was
said
at
the
meeting
about
--
that
these
text
messages
are
subject
to
audit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
say
"we"?
he
--
even
quon
didn't
say
that.
duke
said
he
wouldn't
do
it.
but
earlier,
the
--
at
the
meeting,
the
statement
was
made
that
these
are
open
to
audit.
didn't
say
only
by
lieutenant
duke.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
policy
was
limited
personal
use.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
the
notice
was
we're
going
to
treat
these
just
like
e-mails,
and
e-mails
were
limited
personal
use.
