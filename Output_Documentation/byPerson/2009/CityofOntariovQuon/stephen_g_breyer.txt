justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what's
wrong
with
his
deciding:
i
don't
like
to
do
this
anymore?
i
don't
want
to
collect
all
this
money;
it's
too
complicated;
and
so
i
don't
know
how
many
of
these
messages
are
related
to
work
and
how
many
they
are
just
mucking
around
prying
into
each
other's
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
would
like
to
know,
so
therefore
i'm
going
to
look
and
see.
now,
what's
unreasonable
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying
what's
--
the
city
owns
the
pager.
it's
a
pager
used
for
work.
they
are
giving
a
privilege
to
people
if
they
want
to
use
it
off
work.
it
seems
to
be
involving
a
big
amount
of
collection,
and
so
what
he
wants
to
do
is
he
wants
to
see
how
much
of
this
is
being
used
for
work
and
how
much
is
of
this
not
being
used
for
work.
my
question,
which
i
just
repeated,
is
why
is
that
an
unreasonable
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
and
then
if
that's
not
unreasonable,
why
is
what
went
on
here
that
was
any
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that
differ
from
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
understand.
i
thought
it's
just
a
more
--
a
few
more
words
to
say
just
what
i
said.
that
they
wanted
to
look
into
this
because
they
are
tired
about
collecting
so
much
money.
it's
the
third
time
i've
said
the
same
thing;
probably
it's
my
fault
i'm
not
being
clear.
but
it
looked
as
if
they
wanted
to
know
how
many
are
being
sent
for
work
purposes,
how
many
for
private
purposes
including
prying
into
people's
business,
which
wasn't
too
desirable,
and
--
and
--
so
that
they
could
get
the
--
the
charges
right.
now,
that
sounds
like
what
the
jury
said
they
were
doing,
too.
and
my
question
was
--
i
don't
see
anything,
quite
honestly,
unreasonable
about
that,
where
you're
the
employer,
where
it's
a
swat
team,
where
--
where
--
where
you're
paying
for
this
in
the
first
place.
so
the
reason
i
ask
it
is
i
would
like
you
clearly
to
explain
what's
unreasonable
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
conclusion.
now,
what's
your
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
explain
that
one
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
being
naive
about
this,
if
i
had
a
--
like,
20,
30,000
characters
in
1,800
messages
and
i
wanted
to
know
which
are
personal
and
which
are
work-related,
a
good
way
to
get
at
least
a
good
first
cut
would
be
to
read
them.
[laughter]
okay?
so
i
start
off
thinking
that
seems
to
be
reasonable
to
me.
that's
what
i
would
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
all
right.
now
you
tell
me
why
that
isn't
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
the
officers
might
say:
i
don't
want
you
to
read
these
messages
because
they
happen
to
be
about
the
sexual
activity
of
some
of
my
coworkers
and
their
wives
and
me,
which
happened
to
be
the
case
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
guess
if
you
had
asked
for
consent,
the
officer
would
have
said
no.
[laughter]
now,
he
says,
i
still
want
to
know.
i
will
be
repeating
it.
all
right.
so
what
--
that
didn't
sound
very
practical.
what's
the
other
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
officer
is
going
to
say,
hey,
these
are
all
big
--
work-related.
i'll
tell
you
that.
i
only
had
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
what's
a
third
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
have
been
rough
on
them.
because
you
want
to
let
them
have
a
few;
you
need
pizza
when
you're
out
on
duty.
you
want
to
--
there
are--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--look,
so
far
i
listened
to
four
things,
and
i'm
just
being
naive
about
it.
i'll
read
it
more
closely,
but
i
don't
see
why
these
four
things
are
so
obviously
more
reasonable
than
what
they
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
question,
in
the
constitution,
the
word
is
"unreasonable".
is
it
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable?
so
the
question
--
what
i
asked
is
not
maybe
you
would
have
gotten
a
better
result
if
you
had
hired
bain
associates
and
bain
would
have
done
a
4-month
study
at
a
cost
of
$50,000.
but
i
could
say
a
person
who
doesn't
want
to
hire
bain
and
who
doesn't
want
to
rely
on
the
unverified
word
of
the
officers
who
were
using
these
for
god
knows
what
is
not
being
unreasonable.
that's
the
ultimate
issue.
and
that's
why
i'm
putting
it
to
you
to
show
me
that
what
they
did
was
unreasonable.
