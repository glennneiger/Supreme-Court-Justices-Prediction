mr.
dieter
dammeier
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
an
underlying
fact
that
we
might
be
skipping
over
is
--
is
--
and
both
the
lower
courts
recognize
this
--
that
the
computer
policy
that
the
department
had
didn't
apply
to
the
pagers
on
its
own.
it
--
it
only
came
into
play
after
lieutenant
duke
modified
that
policy
and
told
people
at
the
--
at
the
meeting
that
was
referred
to
earlier
that
the
pagers
are
now
going
to
be
applying
with
--
with
this
policy.
it
--
it--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well,
the
policy
itself
has
two
components
to
it.
one
is,
don't
use
our
equipment,
all
associated
equipment
for
personal
business.
the
other
part
of
that
policy
deals
with
the
no
privacy,
and
it
informs
the
people
there
could
be
monitoring.
and
specifically
on
the
acknowledgment
form
of
that
policy,
which
is
at
appendix
156
of
the
petition,
it
specifically
says
the
city
will
periodically
monitor
e-mail,
internet
use,
and
computer
usage.
and
--
and,
again,
i
think
this
is
why
the
--
both
lower
courts
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
computer
policy
on
its
own
wasn't
in
play
until
lieutenant
duke
announced
that,
hey,
now
the
pagers
are
going
--
are
going
to
be
in
play
with
this
computer
policy.
this
is
the
same
lieutenant
duke--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--sure.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
i'm
sure
the
same
reasons
could
apply,
but
the
--
the
city
is
the
one
that
writes
the
rules
here.
the
--
if
they
want
to
make
it
clear
on
what
it
applies
to,
it
certainly
should
be
on
them
to
write
them
clear
so
the
employee
understands.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
sure.
the
e-mail,
looking
at
the
computer
policy
--
that
goes
through
the
city's
computer,
it
goes
through
the
city's
server,
it
goes
through
all
the
equipment
that
--
that
has
--
that
the
city
can
easily
monitor.
here
the
pagers
are
a
separate
device
that
goes
home
with
you,
that
travels
with
you,
that
you
can
use
on
duty,
off
duty,
and--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--certainly,
certainly.
but
in
this
--
in
this
--
in
this
instance
with
the
pagers,
it
went
through
no
city
equipment;
it
went
through
arch
wireless
and
then
was
transmitted
to
another
--
another
person.
so,
again,
to
duke
--
duke
is
the
one
that
said:
hey,
this
--
this
comes
into
play.
but
lieutenant
duke
is
also
the
one
that
gave
the
privacy
guarantee
to
the
swat
team
members
and
said:
as
long
as
you
pay
the
overages,
we're
not
going
to
look
at
your
pagers;
we're
not
going
to
look
at
the
messages.
so
if
--
if
you
couple
both
of
those
modifications,
both
by
the
same
lieutenant
--
and
he
wasn't
just
some
subordinate;
he
was
the
lieutenant
in
charge
of
the
administrative
bureau;
he
was
the
administrative
bureau
commander.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
this
--
this
is
what
sergeant
quon
testified
to,
that
he
attributed
to
lieutenant
duke:
if
you
don't
want
us
to
read
it,
pay
the
overage
fee.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
he
can
certainly--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well,
he
certainly
could
say
i
don't
want
to
do
this
anymore,
and
he
could--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--and
he
could
tell
everybody.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
i
don't
think
that
request
is
unreasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
here
the
jury
--
the
only
fact
that
was
determined
by
the
jury
was
the
reason
for
the
search.
and
that's
found
at
the
appendix
to
the
petition
page
119.
this
is
the
only
finding
that
the
jury
made
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
search:
to
determine
the
efficacy
of
the
existing
character
limits
to
ensure
that
officers
were
not
being
required
to
pay
for
the
work-related
expenses.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
it
--
it
comes
into
play
on
--
on
the
scope
of
the
search.
again--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--the
scope
of
the
search
was
unreasonable.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
under
--
under
--
looking
at
o'connor,
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
look
to
make
sure
that
the
search
is
not
excessively
intrusive.
here,
what
they
did
was
they
took
all
the
messages
and
started
reading
them.
given
the
purpose,
the
limited
purpose
that
was
found
by
the
jury
for
the
search,
they
didn't
need
to
do
that.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
they--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well,
that's
certainly
one--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--that's
one
of
the
ways
they
could
have
done
it.
they
could
have
got
--
they
could
have
got
consent
from
the
officers
first
to
do
it.
they
could
have
had
the
officers
themselves
count
the
messages.
after
all,
the
officers
were
the
ones
that
were
paying
for
the
overages.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
right.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
they
could
have
--
they
could
have
had
the
officers
themselves
count
the
messages.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well--
[laughter]
mr.
dieter
dammeier
okay.
they
--
the
lieutenant
could
have
said,
hey,
we're
going
to
stop
this
practice
that
i
started,
and
from
this
month
forward
make
sure
all
you
do
is
business-related.
no
more--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--the--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--they
also
--
they
could
have
had
the
officers
redact
the
private
messages
and
then
given
it
--
given
it
to
the
department.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well,
other
than
my
one
sample
of
--
example
of
saying,
hey,
let's
--
let's
stop
the
personal
use
and
we're
going
to
have
a
test
month
to
determine
exactly
how
many
messages
we
need
for
our
business-related
purposes.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
but
the
--
the
sole
purpose
of
the
search
was
only
to
find
out
if
officers
were
paying
for
business-related
messages
that
they
didn't
need
to
pay
for.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
i
think
it
comes
down
from
that
perspective
on
the
excessiveness
of
the
search.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
that
--
that's
exactly
what
we're
saying.
i
mean,
the
interest
here
is
--
is
for
the
officer
to
be
upfront
as
far
as
what's
business-related
to
--
if
he's
paying
for
things
that
he
shouldn't
be
paying
for,
i'm
sure
he
would
--
he
would
be
forthright
about
that.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
that's
true.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
certainly
--
certainly
that
could
happen
in
any
number
of--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--but
that
--
that
could
be
a
possibility
on
any
--
on
anything
that
they
do
in
their
lives,
whether
it
be
their
personal
life
or--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--correct.
correct.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
it's
just
like
my
mail
that
i
might
send
out
to
somebody.
it
might
be
discoverable
in
litigation,
but
that
doesn't--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--no,
it
--
obviously,
there
are
different
reasons
that
could
come
into
play
that
would
legally
produce
these
messages,
certainly.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
no.
it's
like
--
this
--
in
o'connor,
all
nine
justices
in
o'connor
found
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
dr.
ortega's
desk,
because
even
though
it
was
a
state-owned
desk,
you
still
have
an
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
there
are
--
as
talked
about
in
o'connor,
there
are
certainly
a
lot
of
valid
reasons
to
go
through
a
public
employee's
desk,
if
you're
looking
for
a
file
or
if
you're
looking
for--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--or
for
--
or
for
an
investigation.
but
still,
there
was
that
expectation
of
privacy.
you're
talking
about
employees
that
--
in
today's
society,
i
think
work
and
private
life
get
melded
together.
here,
we're
talking
about
swat
people
24/7--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--correct.
i
don't
think
we're
taking
away
the
government's
ability
to
do
searches
under
proper
circumstances.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
the
initial
circumstance
might
be
proper,
but
how
they
effectuated
it
was
not.
it
was
excessively
intrusive.
they
did
not
--
the
purpose
was
to
find
out
if
they
were
paying
for
enough
work-related
messages.
they
did
not
need
to
look
at
these,
what
they
knew
were
going
to
be
private
messages.
they
knew
--
the
lieutenant
had
this
arrangement
that
they
could
use
this
for
personal
purposes.
they
knew
what
they
were
going
to
be
looking
at.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
not
until
they
read
them.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
but
there
certainly
--
they
certainly
knew
what
might
be
coming
because
of
the
arrangement
that
lieutenant
duke
had
in
place.
here
--
here
i
think
that's--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--his--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--no,
but
according
--
according
to
sergeant
quon's
testimony,
he
told
him:
as
long
as
you
pay
the
overages,
we're
not
going
to
read
them.
and
that--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--true.
true.
i
agree.
but
it
was
lieutenant
duke,
the
one
that
was
making
the
announcement
that
now
these
pagers
are
going
to
fall
under
the
computer
policy,
the
same
lieutenant
who
then
gave
the
assurance
that
as
long
as
you
pay
the
overages,
we're
not
--
we're
not
going
to
look
at
them.
i
mean,
when
you're
talking
about
the
operational
reality
of
o'connor,
that
was
the
operational
reality.
the
swat
members
knew:
as
long
as
i
pay
the
overages,
my
messages
aren't
going
to
be
reviewed.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
i
don't
think
that's
in
the
record.
however,
my
understanding
is
that
you
would
get
it
in
between
messages.
so
messages
are
going
out
and
coming
in
at
the
same
time,
pretty
much.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
i
believe
so.
it
identifies
where
it's
coming
from.
it
identifies
the
number
of
where
it's
coming
from.
if
you
know
the
number,
you
know
where
it's
coming
from.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
i
think
with
the
text
messages
--
and
that's
what
we
are
talking
about
the
transcripts
of,
were
the
text
messages
that
were
data
transferred
from
device
to
device,
and
here,
you
know,
we
come
back
to
--
i
did
want
to
touch
a
little
bit
on
the
stored
communications
act
having
play
on
somebody's
expectation
of
privacy
--
you
know,
it's
--
lawfully,
those
messages
were
protected.
and
i
think,
looking
at
people's
expectation
of
privacy,
that
should
be
a
component.
it
certainly
may
be
not
the
end-all
to
the
question,
but
it
should
be
a
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
an
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
that's
not
in
--
that's
not
in
the
record.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
but--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--right.
well,
we
can
assume
that,
but
we
also--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--i
still
don't
think
anything,
given
the
operational
realities--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well,
it's
--
it's
just
like
the
california
public
records
act.
we
should
also
assume
he
didn't
know
about
that
as
well,
because
the
--
petitioners
make
an
argument
that
because
there
is
this
california
public
records
act,
that
that
may
diminish
one's
expectation
of
privacy.
certainly,
if
we're
going
to
have
that,
then
we
should
also
be
having
the
stored
communications
act
that
might
enhance
the--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--i
do.
we,
in
our
brief,
try
to
analogize
that
to
the
mail.
i
think
when
they
sent
messages
to
--
to
sergeant
quon,
that
was
a
letter
that
i
sent.
and
here,
the
department
didn't
go
get
that
letter
from
sergeant
quon
after
--
after
delivery,
meaning
go
get
it
from
his
pager.
they
went
to
the
equivalent
of
the
post
office,
which
was
arch
wireless,
and
got
a
copy
off
of
their
server.
so
i
--
i
think
--
and,
again,
analogizing
to
the
mail,
they
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
while
that
message
is
in
the
course
of
delivery.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
until
the
point
that
it's
on
quon's
pager.
i
think
under
that
scenario,
that
they
could
have
obtained
the
messages
from
quon,
but
they
went
over
to
arch,
the
equivalent
of
the
post
office,
and
got
them
from
them.
it's
like
if
i
--
i
make
a
copy
of
a
letter
before
i
send
it
to
somebody.
you
know,
down
the
road,
i
might
not
know
what
happens
and
i
might
lose
my
expectation
of
privacy
down
the
road,
but
that
copy
i
kept,
i
think
there
is
still
an
expectation.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
i
--
i
agree
with
that,
and--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--i
think
it's
just
a
slightly
different
one.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
they
didn't
lawfully
get
it;
there
was
a
violation
of
the
stored
communications
act
to
get
it.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
but
here,
again,
had
they
gotten
consent
from
--
from
quon
and
got
it
from
him
directly,
that's
a
--
that's
a
different
story.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
that's
--
that
is
true.
i
mean,
they
expect--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well,
they
--
they
expect
that
some
company,
i'm
sure,
is
going
to
have
to
be
processing
the
delivery
of
this
message.
and--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--it's
--
i
mean,
it's
like
with
e-mails.
when
we
send
an
e-mail,
that
goes
through
some
e-mail
provider,
whether
it
be
aol
or
yahoo.
it's
going
through
some
service
provider.
just
like
when
we
send
a
letter
or
package,
it's
going
through
--
some
provider
is
going
to
move
that
for
us,
until
it
gets
to
the
end
recipient.
and
like
the
mail,
that
message
enjoys
an
expectation
of
privacy
while
it's
with
the
post
office--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well,
he
could
have
ultimately,
sure.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
and
--
and
like,
when
i
get
a
piece
of
mail
from
somebody,
i
could
do
that
as
well,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
gets
to
go
to
the
post
office
and
get
my
mail
before
i
get
it.
i
think
--
i
think
that,
you
know,
certainly
adds
a
little
bit
to
the
correspondence
that
dealt
with--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--i
think
it's
certainly
a
harder
argument
for
me
to
make--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--that
they
have
an
expectation
after
--
after
quon
has
it.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
yes,
but
i
think
in
today's
--
i
think
in
today's
society
that's
--
that's
a
reasonable
assumption
to
make.
one--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--i
think
it
might
have
been
florio
testified
that
she
actually
called
her
carrier
to
find
out,
you
know,
if
--
if
the
messages
that
she
would
transmit
would
be
maintained
and
that
was
--
that
they
didn't
maintain
a
copy.
so
there
was
some
understanding
of
how
the
process
worked.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
yes.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
sure.
yes.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
they
can
delete
them.
just
like
if
they
received
a
letter,
they
could
be
put
in
the
shredder.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
well,
i
think
then
certainly
your
expectation
may
be
diminished.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
but
that
would
create
a
free-for-all
in
service
providers.
if
--
if
while
this
message,
after
it's
sent
and
it's
in
transit--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--it's
a
free-for-all.
the
government
could
just
go
in
and--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--well,
certainly,
obviously
the
statute
could
come
into
play
in
addition
to
the
fourth
amendment.
but
here,
you
know,
i
come
back
to
the
mail
analogy.
just
because
at
the
end
of
the
line
somebody
might
disseminate
my
letter
doesn't
lose
an
expectation
in
the
copy
that
i
make
that
i
may
keep
or
that
in
the
course
of
delivery
the
post
office
might
keep.
i
still
enjoy
an
expectation
--
and
the
fourth
amendment
should
certainly
protect
that
copy,
that
either
i
kept
or
the
post
office
is
keeping
in
the
course
of
delivery.
certainly,
at
the
end
of
the
line,
that
letter
could
be
published
to
the
world,
but
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
the
government
coming
in
and
getting
a
copy
of
it
while
it
was
being
delivered.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
honestly,
i'm
not
--
that's
not
in
the
record,
and
the
--
how
that
pager
works
as
far
as
deleting,
i
couldn't
be
certain
that
it
would
be
deleted
forever.
i
would
certainly
not.
one
--
one
of
the
points
to
--
to
raise,
too,
was
that
most
of
these
texts
took
place
off
duty
when
dealing
with
sergeant
quon.
so,
again,
back
to
looking
at
the
actual
practice
that
o'connor
has
us
look
at,
you
know,
here
again--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--there
were
--
there
were
a
large
number
on-duty.
i
think
it
was
broken
down
to
where
the
average
was
27
in
a
work
shift
and
the
most
on
one
day
was
80.
but
also
they
talked
about
--
they
took
about
15
seconds.
so
you're
talking
about
an
average
of
about
7
minutes
during
--
during
a
work
day.
but
the
testimony
of
sergeant
quon
was
that
most
of
these
were
actually
off-duty.
and,
you
know,
i
certainly
--
i
think
that
should
come
into
play,
given
the
department
--
they
gave
them
pagers.
and
it
wasn't
a
one-way
use;
it
wasn't,
hey,
this
is,
you
know,
for
the
benefit
of
the
employee.
the
department
received
a
benefit.
i
mean,
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
have
these
swat
guys
show
up
quickly,
respond
quickly,
and
there
was
a
mix
on
--
on
the
reasons
for
these
pagers.
the
exchange
was,
we're
going
to
let
you
use
these
for
personal
purposes,
and
given
that
reality,
you
should
be
able
to
have
some
--
some
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
use.
it's
like
if
i
pick
up
a
phone
and
i'm
a
public
employee
and
i
call
my
wife,
i
should
be
able
to
have
some
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
conversation,
especially
given,
you
know
--
you
talk
about
guys
that
are
on
24/7.
do
they
have
no
private
life,
now?
do
they
not
have--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--the
computer
policy
was
limited
personal
use.
again,
depending
on
how
that
comes
into
play
with
what
lieutenant
duke--
mr.
dieter
dammeier
--correct.
with
--
with
the
additional
modification
by
--
by
duke,
that
you
could
also
use
them
for
personal
purposes,
from
day
one
when
the
pagers
were
issued.
mr.
dieter
dammeier
thank
you.
