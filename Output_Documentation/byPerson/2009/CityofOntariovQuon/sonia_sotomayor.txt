justice

sotomayor
--counsel,
let's
assume
that
in
this
police
department,
everyone
knew,
the
supervisors
and
everyone
else,
that
the
police
department
people
spoke
to
their
girlfriends
at
night.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
one
of
the
chiefs,
out
of
salacious
interest,
decides:
i'm
going
to
just
go
in
and
get
those
texts,
those
messages,
because
i
just
have
a
prurient
interest.
does
that
officer
have
any
expectation
of
privacy
that
his
boss
won't
just
listen
in
out
of
prurient
interest?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
if
in
fact
--
and
whether
we
agree
with
this
conclusion
or
not,
we
accept
the
lower
court's
views
that
there
was
an
expectation
that
the
chiefs
were
not
going
to
read
these
things,
some
expectation
of
privacy--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
limits
of
it
have
to
be
limited
for
all
of
the
reasons
you've
said,
doesn't
this
case
begin
and
end
on
whether
or
not
what
the
jury
found
is
reasonable
grounds
for
what
the
city
did?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
want
to
--
you
want
to
--
you
want
to
undo
o'connor's
operational
realities
of
the
workplace
and
say
the
minute
you
issued
a
written
policy
that
renders
all
searches
okay,
even
if
the
operational
realities
are
different?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
may
have
an
argument
that
the
nature
of
the
policy
here
and
all
of
the
activities
related
to
it
don't
prove
an
operational
reality
of
privacy,
but
i
don't
know
why
--
you
want
a
flat
rule
that
says
once
you
have
a
written
policy,
there'
no
expectation
of
privacy.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
suppose
that
their
application
of
what
--
how
much
was
being
spent
on
business-related,
all
of
your
suggestions
about
having
the
officer
do
things
does
nothing
about
their
application.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
you're
relying
on
the
very
person
you're
auditing
to
do
the
audit
for
you.
that
doesn't
seem
either
practical
or
business-wise.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
goes
back
to
--
i
don't
understand
that.
you're
still
relying
on
the
person
you're
auditing
to
say
to
you
i'm
only
using
it
for
business.
that
--
that's
just
not
logical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
theory,
or
do
you
make
any
argument
that
florio,
trujillo,
and
quon's
wife
can
succeed
in
their
fourth
amendment
claims,
if
quon
can't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
the
factual
record
was
the
opposite,
that
in
fact
most
of
the
calls
were
--
not
most,
but
a
huge
number
of
calls
were
happening
on
duty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
means
the
government
can
set
up
an
interception
mechanism
on
telephone
transmissions,
on
e-mail,
computer
transmissions--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
answer
his
argument
that,
yes,
you
could
take
anything
from
quon,
but
the
storage
--
you
went
to
the
storage
facility,
which
is
a
post
office.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
have
to
get
into
who
owned--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--whether
this
was
a
--
we
have
to
get
into
the
storage
act
and
figure
out
whether
this
was
an
rcn
or
acs?
