justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
that
point,
do
we
take
it
as
the
law
of
the
case
or
as
a
given
that
it
was
illegal
for
i
think
arch
to
turn
over
the
transcripts
to
the
police
department?
what
do
we
do
with
that
part
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
remand
--
has
there
been
a
final
judgment
issued
as
to
arch,
or
is
that
just
being
held--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
you
have
two
arguments:
one,
that
it's
--
there's
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy;
even
if
there
were,
that
this
was
a
reasonable
search.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
something
like
the
plain
view
argument?
in
search
and
--
search
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i'm
serious.
in
other
words,
there
is,
under
your
view--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--legitimate
grounds
to
look
at
the
messages,
and
then
once
they
see
it,
they
don't
have
to
ignore
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this:
suppose
the
department
asks
for
opinion
of
legal
counsel
whether
or
not
transmittal
of
the
transcripts
by
arch
to
the
department
was
a
violation
of
the
act,
and
the
counsel
said:
this
was
a
violation
of
the
act;
they
had
no
right
to
send
them
to
you.
would
the
department
then
still
have
had
a
right
to
look
at
the
transcripts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
--
no,
my
hypothetical
is
that
the
--
that
there
is
a
legal
counsel's
opinion
that
this
was
in
violation
of
the
act,
and
let's
say
the
district
court
said
it
is
in
violation
of
the
act.
let's
say
we
say
it's
in
violation
of
the
act.
is
that
the
end
of
case?
the
department
cannot
look
at
the
transcripts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
california
v.
greenwood
was
a
question
of
--
of
a
fourth
amendment
standard
that
had
to
be
nationwide.
so
you
say
it's
the
same
--
same
thing
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
greenwood
was
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
criminal
proceedings.
i
certainly
think
that
states
--
at
least
we
could
make
the
reasonable
argument
that
states
can
have
different
policies
with
respect
to
their
employees,
that
have
to
be
respected.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
certainly
--
criminal
defense
attorneys
challenging
probable
cause
would
want
to
look
at
these.
they
would
want
to
see
if
there
is
exonerating
evidence,
under
the
rule
that
all
exonerating
evidence
has
to
be
submitted.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it's
quite
likely,
as
justice
stevens'
question
indicates,
that
there
is
going
to
--
that
these
are
going
to
be
discoverable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
not
--
you're
not
a
police
officer
who
is
making
arrests.
i
mean,
this
--
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
determining
probable
cause
and
mitigating
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
he's
talking
with
a
girlfriend,
and
he
has
a
voice
mail
saying
that
your
call
is
very
important
to
us;
we'll
get
back
to
you?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
city
of
ontario
is
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
california.
this
case
arose
out
of
incidents
when
jeff
quon
was
employed
by
the
ontario
police
department.
he
was
a
police
sergeant.
he
was
also
a
member
of
the
special
weapons
and
tactics
team,
those
teams
are
commonly
known
as
swat.
the
city
issued
pagers
to
quon
and
other
swat
team
members
and
these
pagers
could
send
and
receive
text
messages.
under
the
city's
service
contract,
each
pager,
and
therefore
each
employee
who
had
one,
was
allotted
a
limited
number
of
characters
sent
or
received
each
month.
use
in
excess
of
that
amount
would
result
in
an
additional
fee.
within
the
first
or
second
billing
cycle
quon
exceeded
his
monthly
allotment.
lt.
duke
was
the
officer
in-charge
of
the
pagers.
he
reminded
quon
that
under
city
policies
messages
sent
on
the
pagers
were
not
private
and
could
be
audited
and
duke
told
quon
that
duke
could
audit
the
messages,
but
he
suggested
that
quon
instead,
reimburse
the
city
for
the
entire
overage
fee
to
make
an
audit
unnecessary.
quon
wrote
a
check
for
the
city
for
the
overage.
over
the
next
few
months,
quon
and
other
employees
exceeded
their
character
limits
various
times.
eventually
duke
informed
the
city
--
the
chief
of
police
who
chief
lloyd
scharf
that
he
was
tired
of
being
a
bill
collector.
chief
scharf
decided
to
audit
the
messages
on
quon’s
pager
as
well
as
those
of
another
employee
who
had
exceeded
his
allowance
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
existing
character
limits
were
too
low
and
officers
were
having
the
pay
for
work
related
messages.
the
audit
revealed
that
quon
sent
numerous
personal
messages
while
on
duty.
some
were
sexually
explicit.
quon
was
found
to
have
violated
department
rules.
quon
and
other
respondents
who
were
individuals
who
of
course
corresponded
with
and
communicated
with
quon
on
his
pager,
filed
suit.
they
alleged
that
the
city,
the
department
and
the
chief
scharf
had
violated
their
fourth
amendment
rights
when
reviewing
the
transcript
of
--
and
the
text
of
quon’s
messages.
the
district
court
ruled
for
the
defendants
but
the
united
state's
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
panel
concluded
that
quon
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
context
of
his
messages
and
that
the
trans
--
and
that
the
defendants
had
unreasonably
violated
that
expectation
by
reviewing
the
transcript.
we
granted
certiorari.
the
fourth
amendment
forbids
“unreasonable
searches
and
seizures”
and
that
provision
guarantees
the
privacy,
dignity,
and
security
of
persons
against
arbitrary
an
invasive
acts
by
officers
of
the
government.
the
fourth
amendment
applies
when
the
government
acts
in
its
capacity
as
an
employer.
the
court's
precedents
have
not
definitively
established
how
to
determine
when
and
weather
an
employee
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
workplace.
cell
phone
and
text
messages
--
and
their
and
related
communications
are
so
pervasive
that
some
persons
may
consider
them
to
be
essential
means
or
necessary
instruments
for
self-expression,
even
self
identification.
that
might
strengthen
the
case
for
an
expectation
of
privacy.
on
the
other
hand,
one
could
counter
that
employees
who
need
cell
phones
or
similar
devices
for
personal
matters
can
purchase
and
pay
for
their
own
and
employer
policies
concerning
communications
will
of
course
shape
the
reasonable
expectations
of
their
employees,
especially
to
the
extent
that
the
employer
policies
are
clearly
communicated.
we
need
not
explore
these
matters
further
in
this
case
however.
that
is
because
even
on
the
assumption
that
quon
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
text
messages,
the
search
was
reasonable.
the
search
was
justified
by
a
legitimate
work-related
rationale.
chief
scharf
ordered
the
search
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
character
limit
on
the
city's
contract
was
sufficient
to
meet
the
city's
needs.
the
department
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
ensuring
that
employees
were
not
being
forced
to
pay
out
of
their
own
pocket
for
work-related
expenses
or
on
the
other
hand
that
the
city
was
not
paying
for
extensive
personal
communications.
as
for
the
scope
of
the
search,
reviewing
the
transcripts
was
reasonable
because
it
was
an
efficient
and
expedient
way
to
determine
whether
quon’s
overages
were
the
result
of
work
related
messaging
or
personal
use.
the
fact
that
quon
likely
had
only
a
limited
privacy
expectation,
lessened
the
risk
that
the
review
would
intrude
on
highly
private
details
of
his
life.
but
if
a
search
happened
to
reveal
intimate
details
of
quon's
life,
does
not
make
it
unreasonable.
in
concluding
that
the
search
was
unreasonable
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
to
ways
that
the
search
could
have
been
conducted
that
would
be
less
intrusive
on
quon’s
privacy.
this
approach
was
inconsistent
with
controlling
precedents.
this
court
has
repeatedly
refused
to
declare
that
the
only
--
that
only
the
least
intrusive
search
practicable
can
be
reasonable
one
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
that's
because
judges
engaged
in
post-talk
evaluations
of
government
conduct
can
almost
always
imagine
some
alternative
means
by
which
the
objectives
of
the
government
might
have
been
accomplished.
the
analytic
errors
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
illustrate
the
necessity
for
this
principle.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion.
the
court's
judgment
is
unanimous.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
