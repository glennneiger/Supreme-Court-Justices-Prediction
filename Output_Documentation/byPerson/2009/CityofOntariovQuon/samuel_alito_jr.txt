justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
someone
wanted
to
send
a
message
to
one
of
these
pagers,
what
sort
of
a
device
would
you
need?
do
you
need
to
have
another
pager,
or
can
you
--
could
you
send
a
message
to
one
of
these
devices
from
some
other
type
of
device?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
what
other
type
of
device
could
you
use
to
send
a
message
to
one
of
these
pagers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
a
little
bit
puzzling
because
there
are
--
electronic
communications
are
stored
all
over
the
place
in
--
and
there
isn't
a
history
--
these
are
--
these
are
relatively
new.
there
isn't
a
well-established
understanding
about
what
is
private
and
what
isn't
private.
it's
a
little
different
from
putting
garbage
out
in
front
of
your
house,
which
has
happened
for
a
long
time.
if
--
if
statutes
governing
the
privacy
of
that
information
don't
have
any
bearing
on
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
some
--
i
--
i'm
at
something
of
a
loss
to
figure
out
how
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
regarding
any
of
those
things.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
the
arrangement
that
lieutenant
duke
had
in
place?
i
thought
all
he
said
was:
i
don't
have
an
intent
to
read
these,
because
it's
too
much
trouble,
so
if
you
go
over
and
you
pay
me
the
extra,
i'm
not
going
to
read
them.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
he
ever
say
that
--
that
i'm
not
--
that
you
have
a
privacy
right
in
these
things?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
--
i
mean,
suppose
that
the
department
gave
mr.
quon
a
policy
--
a
statement
that
says:
sign
this,
you
acknowledge
that
your
pager
is
to
be
used
only
for
work
and
that
you
have
no
privacy
interest
in
it
whatsoever;
we're
going
to
monitor
this
every
day.
and
then
these
other
individuals
sent
him
messages.
you
would
still
say
they
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
those
messages?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
an
officer
who
has
one
of
these
pagers
delete
messages
from
the
pager--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--so
that
they
can't
be
recovered
by
the
department
if
the
pager
is
turned
into
the
department?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
can
delete
them?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
sure
that
--
are
you
sure
about
your
answer
to
the
question
of
deletion?
it's
not
like
deleting
something
from
a
computer
which
doesn't
really
delete
it
from
the
computer?
