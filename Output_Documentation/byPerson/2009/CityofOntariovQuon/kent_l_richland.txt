mr.
kent
l.
richland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
less
restrictive
constitutional
standards
applied
when
government
acts
as
employer,
as
opposed
to
sovereign,
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
here.
first,
ontario
police
sergeant
jeff
quon
had
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
vis-Ã -vis
the
ontario
police
department
in
text
messages
on
his
department-issued
pager
in
light
of
the
operational
realities
of
his
workplace,
which
included
the
explicit
no
privacy
in
text
messages
policy.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that
is
the
argument,
mr.
chief
justice.
but,
in
fact,
there
was
no
inconsistency
between
the
no
privacy
in
text
messages
aspect
of
the
written
policy
and
the
oral
information
he
was
given.
first
of
all,
the
written
policy
itself
was
broad
enough
to
cover
text
messages.
it
stated,
for
example,
at
appendix
152,
that
it
applied
to
city-owned
computers
and
all
associated
equipment.
and
again
at
152:
"city-owned
computer
equipment,
computer
peripheral,
city
networks,
the
internet,
e-mail,
or
other
city-related
computer
services.
"
and,
finally,
the
agreement
to
the
policy
was
that
it
applied
--
this
is
at
appendix
156
--
to
city-owned
computers
and
related
equipment.
so
certainly
the
written
policy
itself
was
broad
enough
to
cover
text
messaging
pagers,
but
in
addition
to
that,
nothing
in
the
oral
statements
made
by
lieutenant
duke
undermined
the
no-privacy
aspect
of
the
written
policy.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes,
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
not
when
he
was
told
at
the
same
time
that
these
text
messages
were
considered
e-mail
and
could
be
audited,
and
that
they
were
considered
public
records
and
could
be
audited
at
any
time;
that
is,
it
has
to
do
with
a
different
aspect
of
what
the
policy
--
the
oral
policy--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--yes,
there
was,
justice
ginsburg.
there
was
a
memo
that
was
sent
that
memorialized
the
statements
at
the
meeting,
that
specifically
stated
that
the
text
messages
were
treated
as
e-mail
under
the
written
policy.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
not--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--yes.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
assuming
all
the
other
factors
in
this
case
were
present--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--that
is,
he
is
using
his
department-issued
pager;
he
is
a
police
officer
and
indeed
a
member
of
the
high-profile
swat
team
of
the
police
department.
he
should
be
aware
just
by
virtue
of
that
fact
that
there
is
going
to
be
litigation
involving
incidents
that
the
swat
team
gets
involved
in
where
there
will
be
requests
for
the
communications
that
are
made
on
that
official
department-issued
pager.
and,
in
addition,
he
should
be
aware
of
the
fact
--
and
this
is
something
that
the
dissenters
to
denial
of
en
banc
said
below.
he
should
be
aware
that
there
may
be
inquiries
from
boards
of
the
police
to
determine
whether
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
a
particular
incident
is
appropriate.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes,
and
that's
the
policy.
that
is
the
written
policy,
justice
scalia.
i'm
sorry
for
the
confusion.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that
is
the
written
policy,
and
the--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
of
course,
what
the
--
what
officer
quon's
point
of
view
is
must
also
be
tempered
by
what
we
are
reasonably
going
to
accept
as
a
society
of
his
understanding
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
would
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
for
several
reasons.
number
one,
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
mere
fact
that
something
is
contrary
to
the
law
does
not
in
itself
permit
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
just
two
terms
ago,
in
virginia
v.
moore,
this
court
said
precisely
that.
and
of
course
it
said
it
earlier
in
california
v.
greenwood,
and
in
a
number
of
other
cases
--
oliver
v.
united
states.
because
the
effect
of
that,
of
course,
would
mean
that
we
would
be
constitutionalizing
every
positive
law
that
might
be
enacted
by
a
state
or
the
federal
legislature.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
it
is
law
of
the
case
that
is
binding
on
this
court,
since
this
court
is
a
higher
court.
although
it
is
true
that
this
court
denied
certiorari
on
that
issue,
i
don't
believe
it
is
bound
by
the
ninth
circuit
determination
of
that,
and
in
fact
it
is
our
contention
that
that
was
incorrectly
decided.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
believe
that
everything
has
been
stayed
pending
the
determination
by
this
court.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
justice
sotomayor,
as
to
the
first
aspect,
the
question
of
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
the
motive
should
have
no
impact.
the
motive
of
looking
should
have
no
impact.
the
question
of
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
must
be
analyzed
according
to
the
relationship
between
the
officer
and
his
--
and
his
employer.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i
think
that
what
this
case
begins
and
ends
with,
if
we
assume
that
there
was
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
is
under
the
plurality
opinion
in
o'connor:
whether
the
search
itself
was
reasonable.
and
the
jury
did,
of
course,
make
a
determination
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
search.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
and
i
think
the
reason
why
you
must
have
the
two-step
analysis
in
a
case
of
this
sort
--
that
is,
first
look
at
the
question
as
to
whether
there's
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
then
determine,
if
there
was,
whether
the
search
was
reasonable
--
is
precisely
for
the
reason
that,
without
that,
what
we
will
have
in
every
case
is
the
claim
that
there
was
a
salacious
reason,
that
that
was
the
reason.
and
we'll
be
litigating
every
one
of
those
cases--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
should
never
have
gone
to
the
jury,
that
summary
judgment
should
have
been
granted
in
favor
of
the
ontario
police
department.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
if
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
facts,
i
presume
the
jury
must
resolve
those
--
that
factual
conflict.
but
in
this
case,
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
facts,
and,
therefore,
it
is
a
judge
question.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
it
did,
once
there
was
an
initial
determination
made
as
to
the--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
it
treated
them
differently
out
of
--
because
there
were
two
aspects
to
the
case.
one
aspect
was
the
initial
determination
that
chief
sharp
ordered
to
say:
i
just
want
to
know,
is
our
character
limit
efficacious
here,
or
do
we
need
to
have
a
higher
character
limit?
and
for
that
purpose,
they
needed
to
just
look
at
all
of
them.
and
they
did;
they
looked
at
all
of
the
text
messages.
but
then
when
they
saw
that
some
of
them
may
have
involved
violations
of
department
regulations,
then
it
was
sent
to
internal
affairs,
and
they
redacted
the
off-duty
messages
because
they
were--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--i
suppose.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
redacted
because
the
inquiry
--
the
second
stage
of
the
inquiry
in
internal
affairs--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--was
simply
to
determine
how
much
time
was
being
spent
on
duty
sending
personal
messages.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
so
the
internal
affairs
department
said:
we
don't
need
to
look
at
the
off-duty
messages.
we're
going
to
redact
them.
why
get
into
all
of
that?
we
don't
have
to
look.
the
department
was
pretty
scrupulous.
and
i
think
that's
part
of
what
makes
the
entire
approach
that
they
took
to
this
reasonable.
it
makes
the
search
aspect
of
the
case
reasonable.
and
i
think
it's
important,
in
that
regard,
to
look
at
the
nature--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--no,
it
was
the
other
way
around.
they
looked
at
the
on-duty
text
messaging
at
the
later
stage,
at
the
internal
affairs
stage.
but
they
looked
at
all
of
the
text
messages
when
the
only
purpose
for
the
inquiry
was
to
determine
how
many
of
the
text
messages
in
general
are
job-related
and
how
many
were
personal?
because
the
question
was:
do
we
need
to
raise
the
character
limit--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well
--
well,
you
did,
because
of
the
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
were
job-related
communications
even
while
there
was
off-duty.
these
officers
were
swat
team
officers.
they
were
on
duty,
as
sergeant
quon
said,
24/7.
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
had
the
text
messaging
pagers.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
no,
there
were
messages
that
were
sent
from
various
other
devices.
is
the
question
whether
that
could
be
physically
done,
electronically
done?
because,
yes,
clearly
that
was--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--it
--
oh.
i'm
not
certain
if
it
was
something
other
than
another
text
messaging
pager.
it
did
appear
that
there
were
some
e-mail
entries
in
the
transcripts
themselves,
which
suggested
that
there
might
have
been
a
way
to
communicate
to
them
with
e-mail,
but
that's
just
--
that's
all
in
the
record
that
suggests
that.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
i
may
have
misspoke.
they
were
on
call
24/7.
they
were
the
swat
team,
and
they
had
to
respond
to
emergencies.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
justice
ginsburg,
first
of
all,
there
was
no
--
there
is
no
current
claim
that
anything
that
the
department
did
with
respect
to
the
stored
communications
act
was
unlawful.
so
it
may
be
that
the
other
entity,
arch
wireless,
violated
the
stored
communications
act,
but
that
would
not
preclude
the
department
--
which
was,
after
all,
the
subscriber
--
from
requesting
to
see
what,
in
fact,
the
transcripts
disclosed.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
also
the
fact
that,
as
i
said
before,
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
couldn't
be
based
simply
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
statute,
and
particularly
not
a
statute
like
the
stored
communications
act,
because
that's
a
statute
that's
extremely,
extremely
technical.
and
there
is
a
--
one
has
to
determine
whether
an
entity
was
working
either
as
an
electronic
communications
service
or
a
remote
computing
service,
and
so
on.
courts
are
all
over
the
board
on
this.
as
this
court
noted
in
united
states
v.
payner,
a
complicated
law
like
that
simply
cannot
be
the
basis
for
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
thank
you.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
thank
you.
i
would
first
like
to
just
make
it
clear
that
what
it
is
being
claimed
was
the
guarantee
of
privacy
by
lieutenant
duke
is
really
absolutely
not
that
at
all.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
joint
appendix
page
40,
which
does
summarize
that,
and
it
says
--
here
is
what
precisely
what
lieutenant
duke
said:
"because
of
the
overage
lieutenant
duke
went
to
sergeant
quon
and
told
him
the
city-issued
two-way
pagers
were
considered
e-mail
and
could
be
audited.
"
so
that's
what
he
said
first.
then
he
said
--
he
told
sergeant
quon
it
was
not
his
--
his
intent
to
audit
employees'
text
messages
to
see
if
the
overages
were
due
to
work-related
transmissions.
he
advised
sergeant
quon
he,
sergeant
quon,
could
reimburse
the
city
for
the
overages
so
he,
duke,
would
not
have
to
audit
the
transmission
and
see
how
many
messages
were
non-work-related.
lieutenant
duke
told
sergeant
quon
he
is
doing
this
because
if
anybody
wished
to
challenge
their
overage,
he
could
audit
the
text
transmissions
to
verify
how
many
were
non-work-related,
and
then,
finally,
lieutenant
duke
added,
the
text
messages
were
considered
public
records
and
could
be
audited
at
any
time.
that
is
what
is
being
characterized
as
a
guarantee
of
privacy.
it's
hard
to
see
how
that
in
any
way
undercuts
the
official
written
policy.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
we
do,
with
respect
--
in
at
least
one
respect,
and
that
is:
if
sergeant
quon
loses,
then
we
think
the
other
plaintiffs
must
also
lose.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
that,
once
one
has
sent
a
communication
or
an
object
to
another
person,
they
lose
their
expectation
of
privacy
in--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--it
--
it
does
not
mean
that,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
and
he
says
it's
a
post
office,
but
the
truth
is
that
all
of
these
plaintiffs
admitted
that
they
knew
that
this
was
a
department-issued
pager,
and
this
wasn't
a
post
office.
arch
wireless
was
the
department's
agent.
these
text
messages
were
being
sent
to
someplace.
both
the
written
policy
and
the
oral
policy
indicated
that
they
were
being
stored--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--excuse
me.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
i
think
that
--
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessary
to
do
that,
because
i
think
that
all
that
must
be
determined
is
--
and
i
don't
think
whether
it's
an
ecs
or
rcs
is
--
you
would
require
that
to
determine
who
owned
it,
because
it
was
clear
that
arch
acted
solely
as
the
city's
agent.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i
understand--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--the
point
is--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--i
don't
mean
"agent"
in
--
in
the
most
literal
sense,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
what
i
mean
is
that
they
were
--
in
effect,
when
there
was
a
delivery
to
arch
wireless,
it
was
a
delivery
to
the
city.
and
all
of
these
individuals
knew
that
this
was
city
equipment,
and,
therefore,
this
was
being
delivered
to
the
city.
