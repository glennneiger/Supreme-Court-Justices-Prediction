justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
basic
background
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?
this
is
swat
team
work.
supposing
it
was
an
officer
answering
911
calls
or
things
like
that.
isn't
there
sort
of
a
background
expectation
that
sooner
or
later,
somebody
might
have
to
look
at
communications
for
this
particular
kind
of
law
enforcement
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
wouldn't
you
just
assume
that
that
whole
universe
of
conversations
by
swat
officers
who
are
on
duty
24/7
might
well
have
to
be
reviewed
by
some
member
of
the
public
or
some
of
their
superiors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it's
over
official
--
it's
over
the
official
communications
equipment
that
they
use
for
purposes
of
law
enforcement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there's
no
normal
reason
for
going
through
somebody's
desk;
whereas,
there
would
be
a
very
ordinary
--
ordinary
reason
for
reviewing
calls
made
to
the
swat
--
members
of
the
swat
team,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
