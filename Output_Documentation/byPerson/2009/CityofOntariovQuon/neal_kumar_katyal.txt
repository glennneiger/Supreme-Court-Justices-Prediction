mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
millions
of
employees
today
use
technologies
of
their
--
of
their
employers
under
policies
established
by
those
employers.
when
a
government
employer
has
a
no-privacy
policy
in
place
that
governs
the
use
of
those
technologies,
ad
hoc
statements
by
a
non-policy
member
cannot
create
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
put
most
simply,
the
computer
help
desk
cannot
supplant
the
chief's
desk.
that
simple,
clear
rule
should
have
decided
this
case.
instead,
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
1999
policy
applied
to
pagers,
but
then
concluded
that
that
1999
policy
was
informally
modified
years
later.
and
that
decision
should
be
reversed.
it
disregards
this
court's
repeated
holdings,
including
2
years
ago
in
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
engquist
v.
oregon
about
the
greater
amount
of
leeway
that
the
government
has
when
it
acts
as
an
employer.
and
it
also
is
not
consistent
with
the
plurality
opinion
in
o'connor,
which
observed
that
when
the
government
adopts
a
policy
that
its
employees
lack
privacy,
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
exists.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
so
the
question
is
if
the
stored
communications
act
is
violated?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
don't
think
the
stored
communications
act
was--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--oh,
absolutely
not.
i
mean,
i
think
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
--
that
various
privacy
laws
don't
determine
the
scope
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
it
said
so
most
clearly
in
california
v.
greenwood.
and
i
think
that's
for
a
very
simple
reason,
that
things
like
the
stored
communications
act,
justice
kennedy,
the
electronic
communications
privacy
act,
came
about--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
--
i
do
think
it's
the
same,
and
for
this
simple
reason,
that
when
you
have
a
nationwide
standard
or
a
state
standard,
it's
to
fill
the
gap,
whatever
isn't
necessarily
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
and
here--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
i
think
the
only
question
is,
if
the
--
if
i
understand
your
question
it's,
does
a
federal
statute
about
privacy
somehow
matter
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
about
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy?
and
there
our
contention
is,
no;
it's
precisely
because
congress
enacted
the
stored
communications
act
to
fill
gaps
in
fourth
amendment
law.
that
--
that's
why
it's
enacted.
and
for
--
for
this
court
to
then
use
that
very
act
to
be
the
template
on
which
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
may
spring
i
think
would
be
a
very
--
it
would
be
a
novel
proposition.
nor
should--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
justice
alito,
i
do
think
that
the
underlying
premise
of
your
question
is
one
with
which
we
entirely
agree.
these
are
technologies
that
are
rapidly
in
flux,
in
which
we
don't
have
intuitive
understandings
the
way
we
do
about,
say,
trash
and
so
on.
and
it's
precisely
for
that
reason
i
think
the
court
should
be
very
careful
to
constitutionalize
and
generate
fourth
amendment
rules
in
this
area
at
the
first
instance.
to
do
so
i
think
really
does
freeze
into
--
into
--
into
place
something
that
the
legislature
can't
then
fix,
going
to
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in,
for
example,
murray
v.
giarratano,
in
which
he
said
that
constitutionalizing
in
that
area
--
constitutionalizing
may
pretermit
legislative
solutions.
now,
here
the
stored
communications
act
is
not
violated
under
any
way,
shape,
or
form.
the
stored
communications
act
has
two
different
provisions
in
it,
one
having
to
do
with
remote
--
remote
computing
services,
rcss.
that's
when
an
entity
offers
storage
facilities.
and
the
other
is
for
an
electronic
communications
service.
that
is
essentially
transmission
of
messages
from
point
to
point.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
best
way
--
i
think
the
most
--
the
easiest
way
for
the
court
to
resolve
this
is
to
simply
say
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
what
is
reasonable,
we
look
to
the
policy.
and
here
there's
a
policy
by
the
employer,
it
says
that
computer-associated
--
computer-related
equipment
and
others,
there's
no
expectation
of
privacy.
you
have
a
person
who
is
told
that
repeatedly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
think
the
clearest
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
decide
what
is
reasonable
and
what
isn't
is
actually
the
terms
of
the
policy.
and
it
seems
to
me
very
little
is
more
unreasonable
than
expecting
a
right
to
privacy
after
you've
been
told
in
a
policy
you
have
no
privacy.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely.
there
are
two
arrows
in
the
city's
quiver,
and
i
think
they're
right
as
to
both
of
them.
but--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
government's
position
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
just
from
the
get-go
got
the
standard
wrong
by
citing
--
by
using
a
schowengerdt
test
which
was,
was
this
--
was
this
search
the
least
restrictive
alternative?
and
we
think
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that's
the
wrong
way
of
thinking
about
it,
that
that
puts
judges
in
the
position
of
second-guessing
searches
on
the
ground,
that
they're
not
really
fully
--
fully
equipped
to
do
so.
so
i
do
think
that
is
a
possible
way
to
resolve
this,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
easier,
in
the
following
sense:
i
think
that
thousands
of
employers
across
the
country
rely
on
these
policies
and
millions
of
employees.
and
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
puts
that
reliance
in
some
jeopardy,
because
it
said
that
you
can
have
an
official
policy
and
it
can
be
taken
back
by
what
some
ad
hoc
subordinate
says.
and
that
is,
i
think,
a
very
destructive
notion
to
the
idea
of
reliance
on
these
policies
and
setting--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--to
the
--
under
this
policy,
yes.
you
might
have
an
employer
that
sets
a
different
policy
and
allows
for
some
de
minimis
use
and
a
zone
of
privacy
in
that
use.
you
can
have
a
variety
of
different
things.
but
what
i
think
would
be
dangerous
is
to
have
a
blanket
rule
that
constitutionalizes
and
says
you
always
have
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
in
this
technology.
the
result
may
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
employers
then
won't
give
that
technology
at
all
to
their
employees
and
--
and
eliminate
even
that
de
minimis
use.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
had
also
asked
before
about
the
standpoint
of
quon
in
--
in
evaluating
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
--
of
the
search
in
his
perspective
of
the
policy.
we
think
that
is
the
wrong
way
of
looking
at
it.
instead,
we
think
the
proper
test
is
the
written
policy,
what
it
says,
and
that
is
the
simplest
way,
i
think,
to
provided
administrability
to
the
lower
courts.
they
can
simply
say
was
this
policy
in
existence,
and
not
get
into
those
questions
of
is
it
like
a
parking
ticket,
did
i
flip
through
it
too
quickly,
did
i
understand
that
the
policy
and
the
like.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
not
at
all,
justice
sotomayor.
i
take
it
the
language
about
operational
realities
in
the
workplace,
what
is
right
next
to
it
is
looking
to
whether
or
not
there
are
regulations
in
place,
and
here
a
policy
is
a
regulation.
and
so--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
what
o'connor
says
with
respect
to
the
--
as
long
as
the
policy
is
in
place,
that
--
that's
what
o'connor
permits.
