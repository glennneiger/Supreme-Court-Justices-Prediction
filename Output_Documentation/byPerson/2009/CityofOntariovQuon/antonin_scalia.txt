justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
richland,
a
little
earlier
you
referred
us
to
page
152
and
156
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we
don't
decide
our
--
our
fourth
amendment
privacy
cases
on
the
basis
of
whether
there
--
there
was
an
absolute
guarantee
of
privacy
from
everybody.
i
think
--
i
think
those
cases
say
that
if
you
think
it
can
be
made
public
by
anybody,
you
don't
--
you
don't
really
have
a
right
of
privacy.
so
when
the
--
when
the
filthy-minded
police
chief
listens
in,
it's
a
very
bad
thing,
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
offending
your
right
of
privacy.
you
expected
somebody
else
could
listen
in,
if
not
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
a
judge
question
or
a
jury
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
said
they
did
get
to
the
off-duty
text
messaging
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
if
they
were
on
duty
24/7,
there
weren't
any
off-duty
messages,
were
there?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
we
find
a
right
of
privacy.
is
that
the
end
of
the
case?
i
mean,
wouldn't
you
also
--
in
order
to
sustain
this
lawsuit,
wouldn't
you
also
have
to
find
that
it
was
an
unreasonable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
the
government's
position
on
the
unreasonableness
of
the
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
an
easier
way,
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dammeier,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
private
phones.
there
are
obviously
circumstances
in
which
whether
you
were
making
a
call
between
certain
times
becomes
relevant
to
litigation.
so
you
could
say
that
destroys
the
expectation
of
privacy?
i'm
not
sure.
i
hope
we
don't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
to
say
that
there's
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
desk
doesn't
say
that
every
intrusion
into
that
expectation
of
privacy
is
an
unreasonable
one.
there
could
be
that
expectation
of
privacy
and,
still,
for
some
reason
--
let's
assume
there
has
been
a
theft
in
the
building,
and
it's
known
that
what
was
taken
has
not
gotten
out
of
the
building.
it's
conceivable
that
that
would
be
a
valid
reason
to
intrude
upon
the
expectation
of
privacy,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
this
a
proper
circumstance?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
know
which
ones
were
private
messages,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
until
they
read
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
--
did
he
know
about
that
statute?
i
didn't
know
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
assume
he
didn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
difference
would
that
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
it
can
affect
his
expectation
of
privacy,
if
he
didn't
even
know
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
excuse,
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
--
when
you
send
a
text
message
to
somebody
else,
aren't
you
quite
aware
that
that
text
message
will
remain
confidential
only
to
the
extent
that
either
the
recipient
keeps
it
confidential
--
and
he
can
disclose
it
--
or
somebody
else
who
has
power
over
the
recipient
or
over
the
recipient's
phone
chooses
to
look
at
it?
don't
--
isn't
that
understood
when
you
send
somebody
a
text
message?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
she
should
have
understood
that,
you
know,
whoever
could
get
ahold
of
his
phone
lawfully
can
read
the
message.
in
other
words,
i
don't
see
that
she's
in
a
--
in
a
different
position
from
quon
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
it
doesn't
go
right
to
the
other
thing?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
print
these
things
out?
could
quon
print
these
--
these
spicy
conversations
out
and
circulate
them
among
his
buddies?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
i
didn't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
sent
somebody
a
letter
and
--
and
i
have
privacy
in
that
letter,
and
let's
assume
it's
intercepted
at
the
post
office,
but
i
have
also
published
the
letter
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
newspaper.
i
have
written
the
following
letter
to
sergeant
quon.
do
i
still
have
a
right
--
a
right
of
privacy
in
that
letter?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
the
situation
here.
the
--
the
central
location
that
stores
the
message
is
one
thing,
but
she's
made
--
made
the
message
public
effectively
by
sending
it
to
quon.
once
it
gets
to
quon,
she
knows
that
quon
can
make
it
public
or
that
the
employer
can
--
can
find
out
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
that
--
and
that's
why
you
have
the
statute,
because
the
fourth
amendment
wouldn't
solve
the
problem,
because
you
are
effectively
making
it
public
by
sending
it
to
somebody
whom
you
don't
know
is
immune
from
disclosure.
so,
in
order
to
stop
the
intermediary
from
making
it
public,
you
needed
the
statute.
otherwise
you
wouldn't
need
it;
the
fourth
amendment
would
solve
the
problem,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
richland,
do
you
take
any
position
on
whether
jerilyn
quon,
april
florio,
and
steve
trujillo
stand
in
the
same
position
as
sergeant
quon
insofar
as
this
lawsuit
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
whoa,
whoa.
i'm
not
sure
you're
doing
the
city
a
favor
by
making
arch
the
city's
agent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
opposed
to
an
independent
contractor
who
is
doing
business
with
the
city.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
sure
you
want
to
live
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
