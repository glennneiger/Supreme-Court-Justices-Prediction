chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-1332,
the
city
of
ontario
v.
quon.
mr.
richland.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
written
policy?
[laughter]
the
whole
--
the
argument
here,
of
course,
is
that
that
was
modified
by
the
instructions
he
got
from
the
lieutenant.
do
we
follow
the
written
policy
or
the
policy
they
allegedly
enforced
in
practice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
are
dealing
with
mr.
quon's
reasonable
expectations,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
even
with
the
written
policy,
he
has
the
instructions
--
everybody
agrees
--
you
can
use
this
pager
for
private
communications.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
not
going
to
audit
them.
right?
that's
what
he
said.
he
has
to
pay
for
them.
now,
most
things,
if
you're
paying
for
them,
they're
yours.
and
this
--
it
particularly
covered
messages
off-duty.
now,
can't
you
sort
of
put
all
those
together
and
say
that
it
would
be
reasonable
for
him
to
assume
that
private
messages
were
his
business?
they
said
he
can
do
it.
they
said,
you've
got
to
pay
for
it.
he
used
it
off
duty.
they
said
they're
not
going
to
audit
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
ask
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--let
me
ask
you
to
put
the
written
policy
aside.
hypothetical
case:
there's
no
written
policy.
would
he
have
a
reasonable
expectation
in
the
privacy
of
his
personal
e-mail,
text
messages,
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
all
we
know
is
the
list
that
i
went
through
earlier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
written
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
policy
itself,
from
the
point
of
view
of
officer
quon,
is
a
little
bit
more
complicated
than
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
agree,
i
think,
that
if
the
sca,
the
stored
communications
act--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
that
made
it
illegal
to
disclose
these
e-mails,
then
he
would
certainly
be
correct
that
he
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy;
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
people
are
going
to
follow
the
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
your
client
treat
on-duty
text
messages
different
from
off-duty
text
messages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
it
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
it
treat
them
differently?
under
your
theory,
they're
all
the
same
--
no
expectation
of
privacy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
did
--
i'm
sorry.
i
still
don't
understand.
it
redacted
them,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
don't
have
to
look
at
the
messages
to
determine
that
with
respect
to
the
off-duty
messages,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly,
counsel.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
point
that
you
made
just
a
moment
ago,
that
we
don't
want
to
freeze
into
place
the
constitutional
requirements
with
respect
to
new
technology,
i
wonder
if
it
cuts
the
other
way.
we're
dealing
with
an
amendment
that
looks
to
whether
something
is
reasonable.
and
i
think
it
might
be
the
better
course
to
say
that
the
constitution
applies,
but
we're
going
to
be
more
flexible
in
determining
what's
reasonable
because
they
are
dealing
with
evolving
technology.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
puts
a
lot
of
weight
--
i
mean,
there
are
some
things
where
we
don't
bind
them.
you
know,
you
get
the
usual
parking
garage
thing
that
has
got
all
this
small
print
on
the
back.
we
--
we
don't
say
that
you're
bound
by
that,
because
nobody
reads
it.
but
in
here,
i
just
don't
know.
i
just
don't
know
how
you
tell
what's
reasonable
--
i
suspect
it
might
change
with
how
old
people
are
and
how
comfortable
they
are
with
the
technology
--
when
you
have
all
these
different
--
different
factors.
you
know,
they're
told
you
can
use
it
for
private;
you've
got
to
pay
for
it.
i
think
if
i
pay
for
it,
it's
mine,
and
it's
not
the
employer's.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
your
--
your
position
would
require
people
basically
to
have
two
of
these
things
with
them,
two
whatever
they
are,
text
messager
or
the
blackberries
or
whatever,
right?
because
assuming
they're
going
to
get
personal
things,
you
know,
some
emergency
at
home,
they're
also
going
to
get
work
things--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dammeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
--
maybe
everybody
else
knows
this,
but
what
is
the
difference
between
a
pager
and
e-mail?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
do
that
with
e-mails.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
only
reason
--
the
only
reason
the
officer
would
not
be
accurate
--
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
why
the
redaction
is
such
a
bad
idea.
he
just
says
these
are
private.
and
that
allows
--
and
then
you
could
look
at
everything
else.
you
can
see
if
he's
going
too
far
because
then
everything
else
would
be
there.
but
in
terms
of
--
the
jury
found
this
was
not
done
to
find
out
what
was
in
the
messages,
so
they
don't
need
to
find
out
what's
in
the
messages.
that's
just
a
question.
he
has
to
pay
for
everything
he
--
he
redacts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
it's
no
different
than
the
police
coming
in
and
saying,
well,
we're
going
to
look
at,
you
know,
what's
in
every
drawer
and
then
--
you
know,
then
if
it
turns
out
to
be
personal
and
private,
we
won't
--
you
know,
we
won't
--
it
just
happens
that
we
came
upon,
i
guess,
is
justice
kennedy's
point.
it's
kind
of
the
plain
view
doctrine,
except
they
get
to
decide
how
broad
what
they
can
view
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
happens,
just
out
of
curiosity,
if
you're
--
he
is
on
the
pager
and
sending
a
message
and
they're
trying
to
reach
him
for,
you
know,
a
swat
team
crisis?
does
he
--
does
the
one
kind
of
trump
the
other,
or
do
they
get
a
busy
signal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
would
you
know
where
the
message
was
coming
from?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
again,
it
depends
upon
their
reasonable
expectation.
do
any
of
these
other
people
know
about
arch
wireless?
don't
they
just
assume
that
once
they
send
something
to
quon,
it's
going
to
quon?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
they
can't
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
based
on
the
fact
that
their
communication
is
routed
through
a
communications
company.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
--
i
wouldn't
think
that.
i
thought,
you
know,
you
push
a
button;
it
goes
right
to
the
other
thing.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
just
--
just
to
be
clear:
you
think
if
these
messages
went
straight
to
quon
that
there'd
be
no
problem
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
senders?
i
mean,
no
problem
in
searching
--
getting
them
from
quon?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
have
to
assume
for
your
argument
to
succeed
that
they
know
that
this
goes
somewhere
else
and
then
it's
processed
and
then
it
goes
to
quon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
richland,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
081332,
city
of
ontario,
california
versus
quon.
