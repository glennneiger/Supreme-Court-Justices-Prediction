chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-7621,
sullivan
v.
florida.
mr.
stevenson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
won't
the
next
case
we
get
be
an
argument
that
for
a
juvenile,
particularly
one
as
young
as
--
as
your
client,
40
years
is
too
long;
40
years
doesn't
recognize
his
capacity
for
moral
development
within
a
reasonable
period?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
--
i
mean,
you
look
at
the
federal
government
allows
this
sentence,
right?
thirty-eight
states
allow
this
sentence.
i
just
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
there
is
a
consensus--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
this
type
of
sentence
is
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
reasonable
under
your
approach
to
have
a
different
result
in
these
two
cases?
a
difference
in
terms
of
consensus
or
when
sentencing
is
allowed
would
result
in
a
different
result
in
your
case
than
in
mr.
graham's
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me,
once
--
excuse
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
way
to
take
that
into
effect
is
through
our
normal
proportionality
review
and
in
a
case
by
case.
your
--
your
client
--
his
crime
is
horrendously
violent.
at
the
same
time,
he
is
much
younger
than
in
the
typical
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
requiring
under
the
eighth
amendment
consideration
of
his
age,
as
i
said
earlier,
i
guess,
avoids
all
these
line-drawing
problems
which
seem
--
the
arbitrariness
of
the
line-drawing
seems
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
the
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
--
i
would
have
thought
your
argument
that
this
is
so
rare
suggests
that
maybe
that
analysis,
to
the
extent
it's
permitted
under
state
law,
has
worked
well
for
children.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
death
is
different,
is
what
we
said,
and
because
death
is
reserved,
as
this
court
said
in
roper,
for
the
worst
of
the
worst.
and
we
know
that
life
without
parole
is
not
reserved
for
the
worst
of
the
worst.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
line
is
13,
and
for
obvious
reasons.
another
line
is
going
to
be
16
for
obvious
reasons.
when
the
15-year-old
comes
in,
he
is
going
to
say
15,
the
17-year-old
--
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
why
drawing
the
line
on
the
basis
of
the
eighth
amendment
--
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
eighth
amendment
that
suggests
there
is
a
difference
between
16
and
17.
everybody
with
a
different
client
is
going
to
have
a
different
line,
which
suggests
to
me
that
it
ought
to
be
considered
in
each
individual
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
because
that's
a
policy
judgment
by
the
legislature.
here
we
are
talking
about
the
dictates
of
the
eighth
amendment.
and
the
idea
that
the
eighth
amendment
draws
those
kinds
of
arbitrary
distinctions
is
one
that
i
don't
understand.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stevenson.
mr.
makar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
of
these
cases
is
worse?
a
16-year-old
committing
the
crimes
that
graham
committed;
a
13-year-old
committing
the
crimes
that
sullivan
committed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is,
if
you
had
to
consider
youth
as
one
of
the
factors
that
we
consider
under
proportionality
analysis,
how
do
you
come
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
off
the
charts
on
age
or
off
the
charts
on
violence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
--
would
the
standards
applied
in
that
situation
be
any
different
than
the
standards
that
would
apply
if
you
prevailed
on
his
reading
of
the
procedural
bar?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
see
if
this
jurisdictional
issue
makes
any
difference.
if
you
are
saying
--
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
saying,
well,
if
he
wins,
he
wins,
and,
if
he
loses,
he
loses.
i
don't
think
he
cares
whether
it's
under
the
procedural
bar
or
some
other
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
makar.
mr.
stevenson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stevenson,
mr.
makar.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
third
case
is
sullivan
versus
florida.
this
case
was
argued
--
and
case
number
08-7621,
sullivan
versus
florida
was
argued
on
the
same
day
as
graham.
in
this
case,
the
court
has
issued
a
unanimous
per-curium
opinion
and
it
states,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed,
is
improvidently
granted.
