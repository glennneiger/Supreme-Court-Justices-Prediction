justice
antonin
scalia
but
roper
was
decided
under
a
regime,
which
i
--
i
think
still
exists,
that
death
is
different.
how
could
it
possibly
be
thought
to
apply
to
this
case,
which
is
not
a
death
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
said
kids
are
different
for
purposes
of
the
death
penalty,
which
is
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
the
only
federal
question
in
the
case
now
--
or
at
least
the
preliminary
federal
question,
the
threshold
federal
question,
is
simply
whether
the
state
court
was
right
about
what
roper
did.
and
if
we
agree
with
the
state
court
about
what
roper
did,
then
the
state's
bar
automatically
applies
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
about
that.
we
--
is
the
argument
here
that,
unless
roper
mandates
this
result,
you
don't
urge
that
the
constitution
requires
it?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true,
but
once
we
analyze
the
question,
if
we
decide,
as
the
trial
court
decided,
that
in
fact
roper
does
not
demand
the
result
in
this
case
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
exception
to
the
procedural
bar
of
florida,
which
makes
an
exception
where
the
fundamental
constitutional
right
asserted
was
not
established
within
the
period
provided
for,
once
we
decide
that
in
fact
roper
didn't
establish
it,
you're
out
of
court,
it
seems
to
me.
then
--
then,
automatically,
the
--
the
procedural
bar
of
florida
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
--
did
you
raise
below
your
assertion
that
the
exception
--
that
there
is
an
exception
for
challenging
--
for
vacating
sentences,
that
there
is
--
that
that
is
an
exception
to
the
normal
rule
of
2
years'
limitation?
did
you
make
that
argument
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
you
have
established
is
that
there
is
a
consensus
that
that
sentence
should
be
rare,
not
a
consensus
that
that
sentence
should
not
be
available,
because
most
states
make
it
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
murderers
who
get
life
without
parole.
not
every
murderer
gets
--
gets
executed.
so
how
can
you
say
that
these
are
worst
of
the
worst?
murderers
are
the
worst
of
the
worst,
and
they
get
life
without
parole.
justice
antonin
scalia
call
them
the
"worse
of
the
worse"
maybe,
but
they
are
not
the
worst
of
the
worst.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
how
horrible
the
crime
is
that
they've
committed,
doesn't
it?
but
you
say
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
depend
upon
how
horrible
it
is
and
how
much
retribution
society
demands.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
non-homicide.
six--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
speaking
too
fast.
i
can't
understand
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
i
--
i
don't
understand
what
he's
saying.
can
i
understand
this
first?
he's
there
for
the
homicide
offense
or
for
the
non-homicide
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
burglary,
not
for
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
are
saying
he
could
lose
here
on
the
procedural
bar,
and
then
win
later
in
the
state
courts.
is
that
right?
