justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
arguendo
we
assume
that
the
judge
is
right,
that
roper
did
not
establish
a
rule
that
applies
in
this
case.
then
what
position
are
you
in
with
reference
to
the
procedural
bar?
do
you
have
any
other
arguments
that
overcome
the
procedural
bar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
the
--
under
florida
law,
the
question
is
not
whether
the
right
was,
to
use
the
phrase,
"clearly
established"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
right
is
whether
or
not
--
it
had
--
what
was
your
phrase?
"a
significant
bearing"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
wouldn't
apply
to
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
talking
about
the
first
sentence
of
(b),
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
age
was
he
at
that
point?
