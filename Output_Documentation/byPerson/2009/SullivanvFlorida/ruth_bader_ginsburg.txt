justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stevenson,
there's
a
serious
question
before
we
get
to
the
particulars
of
this
case.
justice
kennedy
suggested
it
in
the
last
argument.
this
--
the
time
ran
out
for
postconviction
relief
in
1993,
and
this
petition
is
brought
in
2007.
there's
a
2-year
statute
of
limitations.
florida
said
there's
a
procedural
bar;
we
don't
get
to
the
merits
of
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
said
there's
a
question
whether
that
means
an
illegal
sentence,
like
the
judge
gave
more
than
the
maximum
punishment.
do
you
have
any
indication
in
florida
law
that
correcting
a
sentence
any
time
overtakes
the
limitation
on
postconviction
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
--
let
me--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
this
judge
said:
yes,
there's
a
federal
question
in
this
case:
does
roper
render
unconstitutional
life
without
parole
for
juveniles?
he
answered
that
question:
no.
and
then
he
said:
there
is
no
other
federal
question
in
the
case;
i
do
not
reach
the
question
that
you
are
raising,
that
is,
life
without
parole
being
cruel
and
unusual.
all
--
the
only
federal
question
that,
under
our
rules,
i
reach
is,
does
roper
cover
this
case?
no.
anything
else
is
procedurally
barred.
what
was
wrong
with
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
--
i
thought
simmons
got
life
without
parole.
i
thought
that
simmons's
sentence
was
life
without
parole.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
that
would
completely
overtake
the
specific
provision.
i
mean,
if
you
say
the
catchall
illegal
sentence,
open
to
challenge
at
any
time,
then
there's
nothing
left
to
the
specific
provision
that
says
2-year
statute
of
limitations,
unless
three
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
leave
out
graham,
then?
your
rule,
you
say
under
the
age
of
14,
so
you
are
distinguishing
your
case
from
graham's?
you
are
not
saying
all
juveniles,
just
--
you
are
setting
the
line
at
14?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
thompson,
where
the
line
was
16?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
about
a
homicide,
a
13-year-old?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
you
are
differentiating
your
position
based
on
young
age
from
graham's
counsel,
who
said
for
murder,
even
in
the
case
of
a
youthful
offender,
life
without
parole
is
an
appropriate
--
is
an
available
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
if
you
raise
the
--
raise
the
lectern
a
bit
--
no,
the
other
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
which
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
tell
--
tell
us
something
about
that
catchall
that
says
an
illegal
sentence
can
be
reopened
at
any
time,
illegal
sentence?
what
--
mr.
stevenson
said
that
is
not
limited
to
just
--
the
maximum
is
15
years
and
the
defendant
got
20.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
what
--
during
the
--
during
the
time,
the
postconviction
period,
would
he
--
he
had
an
appointed
lawyer
at
trial.
then
we
know
that
he
has
a
lawyer
in
2007.
in
between,
was
counsel
available
to
sullivan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
mean
--
i
mean,
he
does
--
he
had
representation
in
2007.
he
didn't
for
his
first
postconviction
motion.
i'm
not
asking
as
a
matter
of
right,
but
did
he,
in
fact,
have
counsel
during
this
stage,
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
did
say
in
--
in
your
brief
that
if
graham
should
prevail
in
his
petition,
that
sullivan
would
get
the
benefit
of
that
decision.
how,
if
we
--
if
we
say
--
just
say
there
was
an
adequate
independent
state
ground
and
we
have
no
authority
to
do
anything
more,
how
would
--
how
would
sullivan
get
the
benefit
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
new
--
a
new
postconviction
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
it's
not
consistently
applied,
then
it's
not
an
adequate
ground.
if
so
--
if
the
citations
are
correct
and
florida
sometimes
treats
it
as
rigid
and
sometimes
doesn't,
then
it's
not
a
consistently
applied
--
not
an
adequate
state
ground.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
in
your
cert
petition,
which
i
don't
have
with
me,
you
raised
the
question
of
the
adequate
state
ground
in
the
second
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
a
question
that
you
raised,
and
then
your
opening
brief
doesn't
discuss
it
at
all.
your
reply
brief
responds
to
the
state
and
then
brings
up
something
in
a
footnote
that
the
state
doesn't
have
a
chance
to
answer.
that
doesn't
seem,
to
me,
a
very
sound
way
to
approach
a
question
that
you,
yourself,
raised.
