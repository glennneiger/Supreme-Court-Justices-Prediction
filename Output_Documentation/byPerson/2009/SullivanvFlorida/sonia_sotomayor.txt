justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
the
court
there
applied
39(a)
and
said:
yes,
it's
a
change
in
law,
but
it
hasn't
been
made
retroactive.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
that
what
the
court
said
here?
it
said,
first
of
all,
roper
doesn't
command
the
results
you
are
seeking;
and,
second,
it
didn't
make
its
application
retroactive.
so
wasn't
it
really
consistent
with
39(a),
the
florida
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
that's
an
unfair
characterization.
what
the
judge
said
was
roper
didn't
say
that
it
applied
to
life
without
parole.
that's
a
very
--
vastly
different
thing
than
saying
that
the
reasoning
shouldn't
be
applied.
it
said
that
we
are
not
choosing
to,
but
that's
not
what
roper
said.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
you
go
back
through
the
statistics
for
me?
for
children
under
14,
how
many
are
in
prison
for
life
without
parole
for
homicide
and
non-homicide
cases?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there's
a
certain
number
of
states
that
didn't
respond
at
all.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
mean
it
was
done
twice?
i
thought
he
raped
only
one
person.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
adversary
provided
statistics
to
show
that
other
people
who
have
committed
rapes
have
gotten
much
smaller
terms
of
imprisonment,
the
average
being,
i
think
we
were
told,
10
years.
so
explain
to
me
why
someone
who
commits
a
rape
is
getting
10
years
and
this
13-year-old
--
it's
the
most
heinous
crime
for
a
13-year-old
that
justifies
life
without
parole.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
did
the
florida
--
what
do
the
florida
courts
do
with
that
series
of
cases
in
your
footnote,
in
the
yellow
brief,
where
it
did
apply
apprendi
after?
did
it
rule
that
it
wasn't
retroactive?
what
did
it
do
in
those
cases--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
consider
the
apprendi
challenges?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
are
wrong
and
they
did
do
exactly
what
your
adversary
said
and
considered
the
issue
of
the
legality
of
the
sentence
under
apprendi,
does
that
vitiate
your
argument
here?
is
your
--
does
that
make
your
adversary's
argument
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
missing
the
point.
what
florida
says
and
what
your
adversary
is
saying
is
--
you're
absolutely
right,
if
you
win
under
graham,
you
could
go
under
39.a
--
if
you
win
under
graham,
and
graham
makes
its
rule
retroactive,
that
fits
right
into
(b)(2)
directly,
and
so
those
cases
you
have
no
problems
with.
what
he
is
saying,
however,
is
you
can't
go
in
to
florida
and
ask
them
to
announce
the
constitutional
rule
under
a
case
where
it
hasn't
been
already
held.
