mr.
bryan
stevenson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
joe
sullivan
was
13
years
of
age
when
he
was
arrested
with
two
older
boys,
one
15
and
one
17,
charged
with
sexual
assault,
ultimately
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
life
without
parole.
joe
is
one
of
only
two
children
this
age
who
have
ever
been
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
for
a
non-homicide,
and
no
child
has
received
this
sentence
for
non-homicide
in
the
last
18
years.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
yes,
there
are
two
responses.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
challenges
to
sentences,
florida
law,
under
rule
3.850,
makes
it
very
clear
that
a
challenge
to
a
sentence
can
be
brought
at
any
time.
what
the
trial
court--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--yes,
we
cite
in
our
brief
summers
v.
state,
which
is
an
example
of
someone
challenging
their
sentence
after
this
court's
decision
in
apprendi
long
after
the
time
would
have
run.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
that
--
that's
correct.
but
the
propriety
of
that
determination
is
exactly
what
can
be
--
is
engaged
in
by
the
state
courts,
and
that's
what
we
simply
sought
here.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
no,
justice
sotomayor.
the
only
thing
the
judge
said
here
was
that
i
don't
think
the
reasoning
of
roper
can
be
applied
to
someone
serving
life
in
prison
without
parole.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
but
our
argument
--
and
i
accept
that.
our
argument
was
we
recognized
that
roper
dealt
with
the
death
penalty
as
opposed
to
life
without
parole,
but
our
argument
was
that
the
reasoning
of
roper
is
similarly
applicable
to
someone
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
the
trial
judge
could
not
evaluate
the
procedural
question
without
analyzing
roper,
and
that's
what
the
trial
court
did.
the
trial
court
conceded
that
if
roper
applies,
joe
sullivan
is
entitled
to
review.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
well,
because
--
because
what
the
court
said
in
roper
categorically
for
the
first
time
is
that
kids
are
different,
and
in
this
context
we
were
arguing--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--well,
i
think
our
argument
was
that
they
are
different
for
the
purposes
of
sentencing.
and
what
triggered
this
--
and
this
is
why
this
is
relevant
to
this
procedural
question
--
was
that
the
state
of
florida
did
apply
roper
to
juveniles
who
had
been
sentenced
to
death
after
this
court's
decision.
and
the
case
we
cited
to
the
florida
appeals
court,
bonifay
v.
florida
--
it's
on
page
38
of
our
joint
appendix
--
was
a
case
where
florida
implemented
that
law,
and
the
law
under
florida
was
that
death
row
prisoners
sentenced
at
the
time
of
joe
sullivan--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--had
their
sentences
reduced
to
life
in
prison
with
parole.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
well,
because
under
your
precedent,
if
the
question
--
if
the
judgment
of
procedural
default
is
dependent
on
an
analysis,
an
assessment
of
federal
law,
in
any
context,
then
it
is
not
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground,
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
we--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--yes,
that
is
the
rule
would
still
allow
us
to
challenge
the
sentence
under
the
notime
restriction
as
it
relates
to
the
sentence--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--well,
yes,
but
if
you
agree
with
the
state
court
about
roper
did,
then
we
don't
--
we
are
not
entitled
to
relief
under
--
under
either
theory,
under
a
merits
theory
or
a
default
theory,
but
the
point
is--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--no.
our
argument
simply
is
that
the
question
that
the
trial
judge
dealt
with
here
was,
in
part,
dependent
on
an
assessment
of
the
federal
constitution,
whether
the
eighth
amendment
does
constrain
a
sentence
like
this.
we
relied
on
roper.
the
court
found
that
roper
was
not
available
to
mr.
sullivan
when
his
case
was
on
appeal,
prior
to
1993.
based
on
that
determination,
the
court
then
engaged
in
an
analysis.
and,
again,
what
triggered
this
--
and
i
just
want
to
make
this
really
clear,
that
death
row
prisoners
after
roper
in
florida
got
a
better
sentence
than
joe
sullivan.
they
got
life
with
parole
eligibility
after
25
years.
the
argument
was
that
that
established
a
reasonable
basis
for
joe
sullivan--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--simmons
did,
your
honor,
in
missouri.
but
in
florida,
at
the
point
at
which
these
sentences
were
being
imposed,
there
was
no
life
without
parole
for
capital
murder.
people
convicted
of
capital
murder
could
--
could
only
be
sentenced
to
life
in
prison,
with
parole
eligibility
after
25
years.
and
so
the
question
was
generated
by
this
court's
decision
in
roper,
how
is
it
constitutional
under
the
eighth
amendment
for
the
death
sentence
prisoner
to
get
life
with
parole
after
25
years,
and
joe
sullivan
at
13,
convicted
of
a
non-homicide--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--my
argument
is
that
if
roper
applied
--
if
roper
is
relevant
--
because
what
the
state
courts
of
florida
have
said
is
that
when
you
are
looking
at
this
question
there
are
three
things.
one,
is
it
a
rule
from
the
florida
supreme
court
or
united
states
supreme
court?
two,
is
it
a
rule
of
constitutional
--
of
a
constitutional
nature?
which,
obviously,
this
would
be.
three,
is
it
a
rule
of
fundamental
significance?
that's
all.
we
don't
have
to
establish
that--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
we
could
say
that
--
that
some
rule
that
has
to
do
with
antitrust
applies,
but
the
judge
wouldn't
have
to
consider
that,
wouldn't
have
to
evaluate
that;
it
wouldn't
be
determinative.
here,
the
judge
could
not
reject
our
claim
without
an
analysis
of
roper.
the
judge
engaged
in
that,
and
let
--
let
me
just
point
out,
this
is
not
a
case
of
procedural
default,
state
court
ruling,
we
are
now
in
federal
habeas.
this
is
a
question
about
jurisdiction.
the
question
that
the
state
is
raising
is:
does
this
court
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
federal
question
that
was
presented
below,
when
the
trial
court
itself
engaged
in
an
analysis
of
roper?
this
court
doesn't
lose
its
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
a
federal
question
when
the
state
court
analyzed
that
question
to
reach
its--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--no,
justice
scalia.
the
other
provision
of
3.850
would
still
allow
us
to
challenge
this
sentence
because
it
is
a
challenge
to
a
sentence,
and
florida
says
that
there
is
no
time
limitation
on
the
challenge
of
a
sentence.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
florida
applies
the
provision,
the
construct
that,
with
regard
to
challenges
to
sentences,
at
least,
there
is
no
time
limitation.
we
contend
that
the
more
relevant
challenge
is
generated
by
this
court's
decision
in
roper.
but,
even
without
that,
we
are
entitled
to
merits
review,
and
no
one
has
argued
against
that.
i
mean,
it's
worth
stating
here
that
there
was
no
responsive
pleading
filed
by
the
state
in
the
trial
court.
there
was
no
responsive
pleading.
no
one
asserted
an
affirmative
defense
arguing
that
these
procedural
defaults
be--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--that's
correct.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
that's
right.
that
comes
from
summers
v.
state,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
justice
kennedy,
where
the
court
has
made
it
clear,
because
they
have
to
sometimes
engage
in
these
questions
about
what's
retroactive,
how
does
it
apply?
they
have
done
that
with
regard
to
apprendi.
they
have
done
that
with
regard
to
some
of
this
court's
other
decisions
in
a
vast
array
of
areas.
eighth
amendment
questions
come
up
all
the
time
before
the
florida
supreme
court
under
that
analysis.
and
with
that
in
context,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
real
question
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
that's
the
issue
here:
do
you
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
federal
question
that
was
considered
below?
mr.
bryan
stevenson
no,
because
at
no
point
did
the
state
make
any
argument
that
we
were
barred
or
precluded
in
any
way.
on
appeal,
we
did
reference
the
provision
in
the
--
in
bonifay
v.
state,
which
was
a
case
that
talked
about
how
these
provisions
can
be
challenged,
how
these
sentences
can
be
challenged
at
any
time.
that
was
the
way
the
case
was
presented,
justice
scalia,
because
at
no
point
did
the
state
ever
argue
an
affirmative
defense
of
procedural
default.
and
that's
how
the
case
gets
here.
it
gets
here
in
the
posture
of
a
very
rare
sentence.
and
i
do
want
to
respond
to
the
notion
that
we
are
uncertain
about
what
will
happen.
there's
no
uncertainty
about
what
will
happen
to
joe
sullivan
if
this
court
rules
in
his
favor.
florida
law
clearly
states
what
the
next
sentencing
option
is.
he
could
only
be
sentenced
to
40
years
in
prison
with
good
time
and
credits
available.
that's
what
florida
law
says.
under
775.082,
anyone
not
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
can
only
receive
a
maximum
sentence
of
40
years.
and
that--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--mr.
chief
justice,
you
may
get
that
case
and
this
court
will
have
to
evaluate
that.
but
i
think
here
what
we
haven't
resolved,
which
i
think
we
have
to
resolve,
is
the
question
of
whether
life
without
parole
is
unconstitutional,
whether
that's
excessive.
and
i
think
there's
a
great
deal
of
evidence
to
support
that
this
court
should
make
that
finding,
in
part
because
of
its
lack
of
consensus.
there
are
only
nine
kids
in
the
entire
country
that
have
been
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
for
any
crime.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
i
think
with
regard
to
very
young
kids,
i
--
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that
the
states
have
adopted
or
considered
or
approached
this
kind
of
sentence,
in
part
because--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
that
the
judgment
that
they
have
made
it
available
in
some
conscious
way
can't
really
be
defended,
because
no
one
who
has
set
the
minimum
age
for
imposing
a
sentence
of
life
without
parole
has
set
it
as
young
as
--
as
13.
when
states
have
taken
up
this
question,
they
have
never
said
that
a
child
of
13
should
be
subject
to
life
without
parole.
what
they
said
is--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--it
would
be
conceivable.
it
wouldn't
be
desirable.
i'll
concede
that.
but,
yes,
it's
conceivable
only
in
the
sense
that
we
know
that
states
like
florida
that
have
created
no
minimum
age
for
trying
children
as
adults,
but
have
created
life
without
parole
for
these
adult
sentencers
have
created
this
world
where
these
things
are
possible.
but
if
you
accept
that
florida
has
adopted
life
without
parole
for
a
child
of
13,
you
also
have
to
accept
that
they
have
adopted
it
for
a
child
of
6
or
5,
because--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--sorry.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
i
understand
your
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
the
court
should
proceed,
for
two
reasons:
one
--
one
is
that
that
kind
of
case
by
case
analysis
hasn't
worked
well
for
children.
it
is
in
part
because
these
kids
are
so
vulnerable,
are
so
at
risk
in
this
system,
that
they
end
up--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--well,
but
--
but
i
--
i
think
in
many
ways
it
--
it
hasn't.
i
mean,
joe
sullivan
never
had
his
case
reviewed,
never
had
his
sentence
reviewed.
the
lawyer
filed
an
anders
brief
on
direct
appeal.
he's
been
in
prison
for
20
years
and
wouldn't
be
in
this
court
but
for
this
court's
decision
in
roper
that
created
some
new
categorical
exemptions.
and
i
think
the
problem
with
the
individualized
review,
as
justice
kennedy
wrote
actually
in
roper,
is
that
in
this
context,
age
can
actually
be
an
aggravating
factor.
i
mean,
the
court
could
have
said
in
the
death
penalty
context,
let's
deal
with
this
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
we
actually
have
a
proportionality
review
that's
enshrined
in
our
capital
jurisprudence.
states
have
to
do
that.
but
we
didn't,
because
we
recognize
that
there
are
distinctions
between
kids
and
adults
that
have
to
be
respected
by
our
constitution,
that
have
to
be
reflected
in
our
constitutional
norms.
and
i
think--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--but
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
for
--
for
--
for
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
we
are
talking
--
for
non-homicides,
life
without
parole
is
reserved
for
the
worst
of
the
worst.
that's
what
this
court
effectively
created
with
its
decision
in
kennedy.
and
in
that
context,
the
same
difference
that
can
be
made
between
kids
and
adults
in
the
death
penalty
context,
we
believe,
needs
to
be
made
here.
to
equate
the
crime
of
a
13-year-old
with
a
25
or
a
30-year-old,
particularly
one
like
joe
sullivan--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--yes,
they
do,
justice
scalia.
but
my
point
is
that,
with
regard
to
non-homicides,
life
without
parole
occupies
the
same
kind
of
end-of-the-line
status
that
the
death
penalty
does
with
homicide.
and
to
fail
to
make
a
distinction
between--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--well,
that's
one
way
of
characterizing
it.
i
think,
though,
whatever
we
say
about
children
and
adults,
we
know
that
there
are
distinctions,
and
those
distinctions
that
were
articulated
in
roper
are
applicable
here.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
i
would
like
you
to
adopt
a
rule
that
bans
life
without
parole
for
any
child
under
the
age
of
14.
and
i
think
that
would
be
supported
by
the
judgment
--
that
ruling
wouldn't
actually
invalidate
a
single
state
law.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
well,
i
support
--
my
client
is
13,
and
there
are
differences
between
kids
who
are
14
and
younger
and
kids
who
are
older.
but
i
support
a
line
that
actual
draws
the
line
at
18.
i
think
that
that
distinction
can
and
should
be
made.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
well,
i
mean,
the
difficulty
of
course,
is
that
--
and
thompson
was
a
plurality
opinion.
we
don't
--
you
could
draw
the
line
anywhere.
and
we
briefed
our
case
recognizing
that
this
court
has
discretion.
there
could
be
distinctions
that
could
be
made
between
younger
kids
and
older
kids,
but
we
certainly
support
a
judgment
that
all
children
should
be
shielded
from
this
age
difference.
the
reason
why
we
make
that
distinction
is
because
that
there
are
legal
distinctions.
there
are
states
that
have
set
the
minimum
age
for
trying
kids
or
imposing
these
sentences
of
life
without
parole
at
16
or
17.
we
do
recognize
long
traditions
on
the
age
of
14.
in
the
court's
opinion
in
stanford
v.
kentucky
authored
by
justice
scalia
--
you
referenced
this
earlier
--
at
common
law
we
recognize
that
there
was
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
children
14
and
younger
could
not
be
tried
for
felonies,
that
they
were
incapable.
and
so,
we
are
just
arguing
that
these
distinctions
can
be
made.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
it's
our
position
that,
based
on
the
incidence
of
these
sentences,
that
even
between
non-homicide
and
homicide,
no
child
of
13
should
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
that
is,
only
--
in
44
states,
no
child
for
any
kind
of
crime
has
received
that
kind
of
sentence.
and
this
notion
that
we
--
we
have
to
think
about
who
children
are
in
the
context
of
this
--
for
the
crime
of
rape,
the
median
sentence
in
this
country
is
10
years.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
--
that
is,
we
think
that
the
data,
that
is
the
consensus,
would
support
both
from
an
age
perspective
and
from
a
consensus
perspective
an
absolute
ban
on
life
without
parole
for
any
child
of
13.
it
--
it
has
been
rejected
by
virtually
every
state
in
terms
of
its
application.
it
has
been
rejected
by
many
states
in
terms
of
its
even
concept.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
states
in
this
country
where
you
can't
get
any
kind
of
adult
sentence
for
a
crime
at
13.
we
don't--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--i
guess
we
make
these
categorical
distinctions
in
lots
of
contexts,
not
just
in
the
death
penalty
context.
we
appended
to
our
brief
hundreds
of
laws
that
draw
lines,
that
say
if
you
are
14
you
can't
drive,
you
can't
enter
into
a
contract.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
well,
it
is
this
court's
history.
that
is,
in
thompson
you
drew
a
line
between
15
and
those
who
are
younger.
in
--
in
--
in
roper
you
have
drawn
the
line
at
18
and
17.
in
other
contexts,
we
wrestle
with
this
all
the
time.
in
atkins,
you
had
to
draw
a
line
of
defining
mental
retardation
in
some
sphere.
what
we
are
ultimately
arguing
is
that
there
are
people
who
are
vulnerable,
that
there
are
people
who
need
protection,
and
children
are
some
of
those
people.
their
diminished
capacity,
their
diminished
culpability,
their
inability
to
be
responsible,
their
vulnerability
to
negative
peer
pressures,
and
their
capacity
to
change
and
reform
is
what
we
think
generates
this
question,
and
we
think
it's
an
honest
question.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
i
think
for
--
for
a
child
of
13
with
regard
to
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
i
think
in
our
construct,
where
we
don't
always
impose
these
sentences
even
for
those
horrible
offenders,
to
not
recognize
the
difference
between
a
child
and
an
adult
is
cruel
and
unusual.
to
say
to
the
13-year-old
in
this
case
that
you
get
life
without
parole,
but
to
the
17-year-old
you
get
4
years
and
you
are
released
in
6
months,
or
to
the
15-year-old
you
get
juvenile
treatment,
speaks
to
the
kind
of
difficulty
we
have
with
the
absence
of
a
categorical
ban.
we
make
these
bans
all
the
time.
and
i
think
that
the
states
are
capable
of
implementing
them.
we
cite
gerstein
v.
pugh
as
an
example
where
this
court
found
time
between
arrest
and
presentation
to
be
violative
of
constitutional
norms,
and
the
states
were
empowered
to
implement
that.
with
regard
to
joe
sullivan,
we
don't
have
to
speculate.
we
know
what
the
sentence
will
be.
if
he
is
returned
and
resentenced,
he
will
be
sentenced
up
to
40
years,
or
actually
the
points
that
were
applied
to
him
would
recommend
a
sentence
between
27
years
and
40
years.
and
we
don't
contend
that
that
would
be
violative
of
the
constitution,
because
there
is--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--there
are
73
children
14
and
younger
who
have
been
imprisoned
for
life
without
parole.
they
can
be
found
in
only
18
states.
for
the
age
of
13
and
younger,
there
are
only
nine
kids,
and
that's
including
both
kids
convicted
of
homicide
and
non-homicide.
for
non-homicide,
there
are
only
two.
they
are
both
in
florida,
and
joe
sullivan
is
one
of
them.
so
the
universe
of
children
under
14
and
younger
is
very,
very
small,
smaller
than
what
this
court
was
dealing
with
in
roper
in
terms
of
the
number
of
death
sentences,
smaller
than
what
this
court
was
likely
dealing
with
in
atkins.
it's
what
this
court
has
looked
at
generally
to
find
consensus.
and
here,
where
only
18
states
have
imposed
these
sentences,
a
judgment
that
this
is
rejected,
this
is
outside
the
norms,
would
be
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents
in
roper
and
atkins
and
coker
and
kennedy
and
the
other
cases.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
yes.
that
would
be
111.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
seventy-seven.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
six.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
and
with
regard
to
children
younger,
we're
also
talking
about
just
the
universe
of
six,
14
and
younger,
all
in
florida.
and
so
it
is
this
absence--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--non-homicide,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
and
so
it
is
this
absence
of
a
categorical
rule
that
has
created
some
of
these
results.
there
are
some
other
arbitrary
features
about
this
population
that
we've
raised
in
our
brief
that
are
concerning.
they
are
disproportionately
kids
of
color--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--well,
these
statistics
come
from
the
states'
departments
of
corrections,
your
honor.
i
mean,
we
--
we
gave
the
state
--
the
state
doesn't
contest
our
data,
at
least
in
their
pleading,
and
we
don't
control
these
numbers.
the
departments
of
corrections
control
these
numbers,
and
where
these
data
are
within
their
power
of
the
state
to
present,
we
don't
think
there's
any
real
question
about
the
reliability
of
the
data
that
we
are
relying
on.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
there
are
very
few.
in
one
study,
there
were
only
two
states.
in
the
report
that
we
generated,
we
got
the
information
from
all
states.
i
see
my
white
light
is
on.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
sotomayor,
the
case
is
hughes
v.
state.
it
is
cited.
it
is
an
application
of
apprendi,
where
the
defendant
does
not
prevail
but,
nonetheless,
is
entitled
to
that
review.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
in
this
case
that,
if
a
death
row
prisoner
who
was
a
juvenile
was
still
on
death
row
in
florida,
had
not
sought
the
relief
and
obtained
the
relief
that
he
is
entitled
to
under
roper,
he
would
be
barred
from
such
relief
because
he
did
not
file
within
the
2
years.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
well,
i
--
and
that's
what
i
disagree
with,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
is
doing
in
hughes.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
is
doing
in
these
other
cases.
otherwise,
a
lot
of
this
court's
rules
don't
have
clear
and
direct
categorical
lines.
you
have
to
apply
them.
you
have
to
apply
them
in
context.
and
it
would
mean
that
people
whose
sentences
are
now
illegal
under
the
law,
only
when
applied,
would
be
so
banned,
and
that's
what
i
don't
think
the
florida
legislature
or
the
florida
courts
are
saying.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
yes
--
yes,
there
are,
justice
alito,
and
--
and,
again,
i
just
want
to
contextualize
why
this
is
the
way
it
is.
at
no
point
did
the
state
make
any
of
these
arguments
in
the
lower
courts.
they
did
make
it
at
trial.
they
did
not
make
it
on
appeal.
this
issue
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
that's
correct.
there
are
other
situations
where
they
have
made
eighth
amendment
claims
and
analyses,
and
sometimes
the
petitioners
lose;
sometimes
they
prevail.
they
have
done
it
in
other
contexts.
and
so
i
do
think
that
it's
quite
clear,
from
the
way
florida
applies
these
cases,
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
bryan
stevenson
we
did
--
well,
what
we
raised
was
that,
without
this
court
intervening,
that
people
like
joe
sullivan
would
likely
never
get
review.
our
point
was
that,
without
an
intervention
from
this
court,
people
like
joe
sullivan
--
there
hasn't
been
a
sentence
like--
mr.
bryan
stevenson
--yes.
justice
ginsburg,
we
read
that
second
question
to
be
should
this
court
take
an
interest
in
a
case?
should
this
court
be
barred?
should
this
court
intervene
where
a
child
of
13
has
been
sentenced
to
life
without
parole,
and
there
may
never
be
another
example?
he
can't
go
to
federal
habeas
corpus
because
he
is
time-barred
from
that.
so
this
court's
opportunity
to
review
the
case
is
critical.
that's
what
we
thought
we
were
raising
in
the
second
question.
frankly,
we
thought
that
the
jurisdictional
question
was
a
question
that
was
pretty
clear
--
plain
on
its
face
because
the
trial
court's
disposition
of
the
this
case
was
completely
dependent
on
its
interpretation
of
roper,
and
i
think
that's
what
gives
this
court
jurisdiction.
you
have
said,
repeatedly,
in
ohio
v.
reiner,
in
ake
v.
oklahoma,
when
the
analysis
of
a
state
procedural
rule
does
depend
on
an
assessment
of
the
federal
law,
you
have
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
that
jurisdiction
should
be
exercised
in
this
case
to
declare
that
this
sentence
is
unconstitutional.
it
is
unquestionably
unusual
to
have
--
no
child
of
13
in
this
country
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
in
44
states
makes
it
clear
that
this
is
an
unusual
sentence.
but
we
also
contend
to
say
to
any
child
of
13
that
you
are
only
fit
to
die
in
prison
is
cruel.
it
can't
be
reconciled
with
what
we
know
about
the
nature
of
children,
about
the
character
of
children.
it
cannot
be
reconciled
with
our
standards
of
decency,
and
we
believe
that
the
constitution
obligates
us
to
enforce
those
standards
and
reverse
this
judgment.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
