stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
do
what
you
have
just
done
with
the
category
non-homicide
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
life
without
parole?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
the
age
of
18
when
committed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
hundred
and
eleven.
of
those
111,
how
many
are
in
florida?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
seventy-seven.
and
of
the
remaining,
how
many
states
are
they
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
six.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
it's
suspect.
what
is
your
opinion,
so
far
as
you
can
do
it,
following
category:
non-homicide,
life
without
parole,
under
the
age
of
18
when
committed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
in
your
own
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
know
how
many
people
in
florida--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--non-homicide,
life
without
parole,
under
the
age
of
18
when
committed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
say
77?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
let's
--
let's
count
it
their
way.
let's
say
that
a
--
non-homicide--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
--
so
in
your
example,
mr.
smith
was
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
for
a
robbery.
then
you
said
mr.
smith
also
killed
someone.
now,
was
he
convicted
of
killing
someone?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
and
so
did
the
judge
have
in
front
of
him
the
conviction
for
the
killing
of
the
person
as
well
as
for
the
burglary
or
whatever?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
so
i
think
i
could
count
that
as
a
homicide
offense.
i
understand
your
point.
now,
let's
suppose
that
we
take
those
out
of
it;
in
other
words,
for
argument's
purpose,
concede
that
where
there
is
also
a
homicide
offense,
it
counts
as
homicide,
not
in
the
set
i
am
asking
you
about.
i'm
asking
you
about
the
set
of
those
non-homicide
offenses,
life
without
parole,
and
they
were
under
the
age
of
18
when
committed.
how
many
in
florida?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
you
gave
--
said
that
the
reason
for
the
difference
was
a
set
of
instances
that
i
just
asked
you
to
put
to
the
side.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
is
the
right
--
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
think
if
you
want
to
address
it,
that
the
basic
argument
here
is
we
want
a
bright
line.
and
the
justification
for
the
bright
line
is
(a)
it's
pretty
unusual
to
have
this.
so
that
is
one
part
of
the
clause.
and
in
respect
to
it
being
cruel,
you
go
back
to
what
is
supposed
to
be
some
kind
of
rough,
basic
connection
between
criminal
law
and
generally
accepted
principles
of
morality.
and
the
confusion
and
uncertainty
about
the
moral
responsibility
of
a
13-year-old
is
such
that
it
is
not
--
it
is
a
cruel
thing
to
do
to
remove
from
that
individual
his
entire
life.
you
say
we're
at
the
extreme.
now
that's
roughly
what's
perking
around
in
my
mind,
and
i
would
like
you
to
reply
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
wasn't
my
point.
i
guess
i
wasn't
clear.
my
point
was,
of
course,
there
can
be
cases
in
any
set
which
go
in
all
kinds
of
different
directions.
but,
as
a
general
matter,
human
beings
are
uncertain
about
how
much
moral
responsibility
to
assign
to
individuals
in
a
particular
category,
and
that
category
roughly
corresponds
with
an
age
of
maturity.
so
you
get
into
arguments
when
you
get
to
10,
no;
11,
no;
17,
yes
maybe;
16,
yes
maybe.
but
as
long
as
we
are
around
3
years
old,
5,
7,
9,
12,
and
they
want
to
say
certainly
14,
we
are
in
that
area
of
ambiguity.
and
not
just
we,
people
all
over
america,
some
thinking
one
way,
some
thinking
another.
and
that's
enough
to
cut
the
connection
with
morality,
a
strong
enough
connection
that
could
justify
taking
the
person's
entire
life
away.
you
see,
i'm
trying
to
make
a
general
argument,
and
maybe
i
haven't
stated
it
perfectly.
but
if
you
can
get
the
drift
of
what
i'm
talking
about,
i
would
like
to
hear
your
reply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
comment
on
the
district
court,
the
--
the
--
what
--
what
the
--
your
opponent
says
is
that
this
florida
rule
is
a
rule
as
the
district
court
applied
it
that
said
the
following:
you
have
to
file
a
challenge
within
2
years.
there
are
three
exceptions
to
that.
one
and
three
clearly
don't
apply.
and
as
to
two,
roper
isn't
clear
enough
to
make
it
apply.
their
response
to
that
is
there
is
no
florida
law
that
says
you
have
to
challenge
a
sentence
within
2
years.
that
florida
courts
--
and
then
they
have,
like,
14
cases
listed
here.
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
said
that
when
you
are
trying
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence,
that
whole
part
of
the
statute
does
not
apply.
okay?
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
what
i
should
do
is
go
look
up
and
see
what
those
cases
hold,
and
--
and
you
said
to
the
lower
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
--
you
said
their
argument
is
wrong.
the
2-year
statute
does
apply.
there
are
three
exceptions,
and
you
do
not
fit
within
section
(b)
because.
where
did
you
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
state
didn't
even
deny
what
he
was
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
state
--
he
says
that
whole
section
doesn't
apply.
there
is
no
2-year
statute.
and
you
say
florida
did
not
reply
in
a
brief
to
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
any
case,
there
is
a
circularity
point
here,
i
guess.
if
we
were
to
say
in
our
opinion
--
if
we
were
to
say
that
roper
does
hold
that
there
is
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
which
we
extend
to
this
case
and
it
applies
here,
and
it
applies
to
the
--
retroactively
to
those
whose
--
certainly
those
who
are
raising
the
issue,
then
we
would
send
it
back
and
florida
now
would
not
bar
it
under
this
statute,
because
it
would
fall
squarely
within
the
exception.
is
that
right?
