mr.
scott
d.
makar
may
it
please
the
court:
as
to
the
data,
in
our
view,
the
data
is
unreliable.
the
data
--
unlike
the
death
penalty
context,
where
there
is
a
rich
literature
of
data
that's
been
generated
over
years
on
mitigating
factors
and
so
forth
and
there's
full
regard,
the
data
here
is
suspect--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--justice
breyer,
we
have
no
data
on--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
i'm
sorry,
let
me
--
in
florida,
it
was
the
non-homicide.
we--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--one
hundred
and
fifty.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
they
say
77.
that's
correct.
the
reason
being
is
that
the
study
they're
relying
upon,
which
was
generated
this
summer
while
this
case
was
pending--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i'm
sorry.
the
reason
it's--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
the
reason
why
is
that
the
annino
study
upon
which
they
rely,
which
was
generated
just
this
past
summer,
doesn't
count
a
non-homicide
offense
that
happens
to
also
be
bundled
with
a
homicide
offense.
so,
for
example,
if
someone
went
down
the
street,
committed
an
armed
burglary
as
graham
did,
but
then
they
went
across
the--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--this
is
an
individual
that
they
don't
count.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
and
this
is
a
person
who
committed,
for
example,
an
armed
burglary.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
and
then
--
and
put
in
jail
and
sentenced
to
life
without
parole.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
right,
non-homicide.
but
they
happened,
as
the
course
of
a
crime
spree,
to
commit
a
homicide
offense
down
the
road
at
a
different
location.
they
don't
count
that
sentence
for
the
non-homicide
offense
in
their
data.
they
undercount
the
data
dramatically.
and
in
addition,
the
states
--
this
is
not
an
easy
issue.
the
states
have
primary
offenses
and
secondary
offenses.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
yes,
and
he
was--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--yes,
sir.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
by
our
number,
it's
150.
they
say
77.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
okay.
if
you
are
asking
me
to
accept
their
number,
if
they
use
that
definition,
that
is
correct.
it
would
be
77
individuals
that
would
be
life
without
parole.
that's
correct.
and--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
worse
in
which
sense?
i
mean,
under
the
eighth
amendment,
which
would
be--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
think
certainly
in
this
case
we
are
at
the
far
extreme.
we're
off
the
charts.
this
is
one
of
those
unfathomable--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--violence,
i'm
sorry.
the
violence
meaning
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
severe
violent
acts
that
any
human
being
could
perpetuate
upon
anyone
else.
it
was
done
twice;
there
was
two
counts.
so
in
that
regard--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--two
different
--
the
woman
--
there
was
two
counts
of
--
of
sexual
battery
in
the
--
he
committed
the
offense
in
two
different
ways
upon
this
woman,
and--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
when
we
look
at
the
data
for
sexual
battery,
there's
a
distribution,
and
there's
all
kinds
of
factors
underlying
each
of
those
sentences,
and
we
have
hundreds
of
sexual
battery
sentences
in
florida.
each
one
is
unique,
and
each
one
is
presented
to
the
trial
judge
who
makes
the
determination
about
the
sentence.
and
there
are
very
harsh
sentences,
certainly,
for
some
offenses
and
not
for
others.
but
to
take
the
notion
that
one
could
average
them
together
and
walk
into
court
and
say,
i'm
way
above
the
average,
i
should
somehow
get
an
eighth
amendment
remedy,
we
believe
is
just
the
wrong
methodology.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
certainly
--
and
i've
got,
mr.
chief
justice,
questions
about
how
does
age
play
a
role
in
proportionality
and
so
forth.
and
i
think
here
that
a
13-year-old
can
commit
the
most
heinous
of
crimes.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
sure.
well,
i
think
what
you
are
getting
to,
justice
breyer,
is
that
--
two
things:
one
is
that
the
distribution
as
a
function
of
age.
we
know
that
at
younger
ages
the
crime
occurrence,
the
incidence,
goes
down.
and
that
goes
to
the
second
point,
which
is
that
this
is
a
good
thing.
it's
--
it's
a
lawful
sentence
that
can
be
imposed,
but
it's
rare.
and
we
are
--
we
should
be
proud
of
that,
that
it
doesn't
occur
with
a
--
with
a
great
regularity.
it's
an
unfortunate
thing
that
it
happens,
that
we
have
these
gross
acts
of
depravity
that
would
justify
it
even
for
someone
that's
very
young.
sullivan
is
not
here
to
tell
the
court:
i
should
not
be
punished.
he
has
told
the
court:
i
can
be
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
all
he
is
asking
for
is
this
opportunity
to
get
out,
this
parole
opportunity.
that's
what
--
what
we
are
talking
about.
and
this
issue
that
he
has
presented
obviously
was
not
one
the
florida
trial
court
could
have
addressed
whatsoever.
justice
ginsburg,
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head.
to
interpret
the
rules
the
way
they
are
interpreting
our
rules
in
florida
would
swallow
the
3.850(b)(2)
exception
that
says--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
that's
incorrect.
the
two
rules
he
is
citing
to
at
this
point
--
one
raised
in
the
reply
brief
--
deal
with
motions
to
correct
a
sentence
that
exceeds
limits
provided
by
law
--
that
exceeds
the
limits
provided
by
law.
and
the
florida
courts
have
held
that
this
is
--
in
these
situations,
it's
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing.
in
other
words,
if
--
and
--
and
then
there's
the
exception
under
3.850(b)(2)
that
says--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no,
because
3.850(b)(2)
--
well,
i
think
if,
for
example,
at
the
time
of
sentencing--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--right.
that's
the
one
they're
relying
upon:
a
motion
to
vacate
a
sentence
that
exceeds
the
time
limits
provided
by
law
may
be
filed
at
any
time.
that
has
been
interpreted
in
the
florida
courts
not
to
allow
a
new
constitutional
right
that
has
been
applied
retroactively
to
be
raised.
it's
applied
to
say:
at
the
time
of
your
sentencing,
on
the
face
of
it,
can
--
was
there
an
error
that
was
made?
okay.
and
--
and
to
interpret
it
their
way
would
swallow
the
exception.
florida
is
entitled,
like
every
other
state,
to
create
a
limited
exception
under
its
postconviction
rules
to
say:
we
are
only
going
to
consider
new
fundamental
constitutional
rights
that
are
applied
retroactively.
i
think,
simply
put,
the
florida
trial
court
couldn't
answer
the
question
they
want
this
court
to
now
answer.
it
was
beyond
the
trial
court's
jurisdiction.
the
court
below
couldn't
create
a
new
right,
extend
one,
or
make
it
retroactive.
the
trial
court
did
what
we
would
expect
the
trial
court
to
do
here,
is
take
a
quick
look:
what
are
you
asking
me
to
do?
do
you
want
me
to
apply
roper
in
a
context
that
it
doesn't
state?
i
can't
do
that.
the
rule
3.850(b)(2)
says
i
can't
do
that.
and
the
judge
said
it
on
the
record
here,
joint
appendix
56,
57,
and
58:
the
claim
does
not
fit
into
the
limited
category
of
claims
allowed
to
be
brought
after
the
expiration
of
the
2-year
period.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
not
as
a
matter
of
right,
and
he
did
file,
i
believe,
a
habeas--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--not
--
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
he
did
file
a
pro
se
state
postconviction
challenging
the
--
the
failure
to
have
a
semen
sample
taken
and
the
failure
to
examine
one
of
his
--
his
codefendants
at
trial.
and
that
was
a
pro
se
pleading.
i
have
looked
at
it,
and
it
--
it
is
actually
not
bad.
it
was
one,
i
guess,
that
was
probably
done
while
--
along
the
--
in
the--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--he
would
have
been
approximately,
i
think,
16,
somewhere
late
teens,
i
believe;
it
was
a
few
years
after,
'89,
or
'90.
it
was
about
4,
so
he
was
about
17,
i
think,
or
thereabouts.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
that's
not
what
those
cases
stand
for.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
state
brief
filed
in
opposition
to
his
appeal.
that
the
first
district
pca--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--didn't
deny
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
no,
because
i
think
it
was
so
obvious
from
the
trial
judge's
order
that
he
was
relying
on
the
procedural
bar
of
3.850(b)(2).
the
trial
court
had
no
--
the
trial
court
couldn't
do
anything.
the
trial
court
couldn't
say--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i
think
--
i
think
roper
applies.
and
he
said
it
just
doesn't
apply
here.
it's
barred.
i
--
i
can't
do
anything
more
with
it.
so
--
and
i
think
the
fact
that
he
took
a
quick
look
at
the
roper
decision
and
made
that
determination
under
florida
law
--
this
court
said
in
footnote
10
in
harris
v.
reed
that
the
trial
court
shouldn't
be
fearful
of
looking
at
the
federal
issue
for
--
for
fear
of
having
it
come
up
as
being
a
--
establishing
federal
jurisdiction.
and
then
in
tyler
v.
cain,
this
court
had
a
retroactivity
issue
presented
to
it
as
well.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
that's
exactly
right,
justice
breyer.
if
in
the
graham
case
you
have
a
categorical
rule
that
says
18
and
under,
then
prospectively
that
line
is
established,
and
sullivan
could
file
a
postconviction
motion
under
3.850(b)(2)
and
pursue
it.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
he
could
file
--
the
next
day
he
could
file
a--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--absolutely.
absolutely.
and
that
the
florida
court
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
exception
to
consider,
given
that
it
would
establish
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
that's
retroactive
in
application
to
his
situation.
so--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i'm--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
think
that
--
but
his
winning
would
be
hinging
upon
graham,
rather
than
winning
in
this
forum
today,
on
a
new
claim,
that
the
trial
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
but
that's
premised
upon
this
court
establishing
a
new
fundamental
right
in
graham,
a
categorical
rule,
that
would
apply
to
him
in
his
case,
retroactive
application.
that's
--
that's
possible,
and
we
--
we
acknowledge
that.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
my--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--my
recollection
is
that
the
retroactivity
was
there,
so
that
they
would
apply
it,
but,
frankly,
i
cannot,
as
i
stand
here,
i
can't
tell
you
all
--
what
all
the--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
don't
think
that
a
court
here
or
there
that
may
deviate
from
the
rule
would
establish
the
precedent.
i
think
they
--
they've
cited,
in
their
--
in
their
brief,
the
--
the
decision
of
carter
v.
state
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
which
i
think
has
a
pretty
good
recitation
of
how
the
rule
operates.
and
it
may
be
that
there's
a
fifth
district
case
they
rely
upon,
where
the
--
the
language
is
a
little
squishy,
but
those
are
--
those
are
anomalies,
and
they
are
not
the
rule
in
florida.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
there
is
no
question
that
3.850(b)(2)
is
consistently
and
regularly
applied.
these
other
rules,
i
would
submit,
are
consistently
and
regularly
applied.
the
one
--
the
two
fifth
district
opinions
they
cite
--
i
have
looked
at
them
and
the
language
there,
it's
ambiguous,
it's
not
exactly
clear,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
lower
court,
the
lower
appellate
court's
rulings
would
override
the
florida
supreme
court
who
controls
the
rules.
they
set
the
rules
in
florida.
they
have
rulemaking
authority.
that,
somehow,
that
would
throw
out
the
adequacy
of
the
--
of
the
state
law
ground.
in
conclusion,
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
we
ask
that
the
court
dismiss
this
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
alternatively,
we
ask,
as
to
this
case
and
the
others,
that
--
that
the
questions
presented
should
be
addressed
and
answered,
which
is
whether
there's
a
categorical
ban
and
--
that
they
do
not
--
a
categorical
ban
does
not
exist.
thank
you.
