justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
argument
is
that
because
the
--
the
state
judge
had
to
decide
whether
roper
dictated
or
required
the
result
that
you
were
asking
for,
that
--
that
it's
not
an
independent
state
ground.
that's
the
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
i'm
--
i'm
interested
in
how
we
decide
whether
it's
independent.
if
you
had
cited
--
if
you
said
marbury
v.
madison
dictates
this
result,
well,
the
judge
would
have
to
decide
what
marbury
v.
madison
required.
that's
a
federal
--
that
can
be
characterized
as
a
federal
question.
that
would
make
the
--
that
would
make
it
--
the
state
law
ground
not
an
independent
ground?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
categorical
rule
that
you
would
like
us
to
adopt?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
your
response
to
the
state's
argument
that
these
statistics
are
not
peer-reviewed?
and
these
are
statistics,
am
i
right,
that
you
generated
yourself?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
address
this
in
footnote
35
of
your
reply
brief,
and
it
would
have
been
a
little
bit
helpful
if
you
had
raised
it
initially,
so
that
the
state
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
reply,
but
you
introduced
the
citation
there
with
"for
example",
and
then
you
cite
some
cases.
are
there
others?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
--
there
are
other
cases
in
which
the
lower
florida
courts
have
used
--
have
said
that
this
particular
subsection
is
appropriate
for
raising
a
constitutional
challenge.
