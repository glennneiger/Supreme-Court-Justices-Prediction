ms.
celia
a.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
creating
exceptions
to
the
rule
of
edwards
means
a
clear
rule
is
lost.
it
introduces
uncertainty
into
the
determinations
of
what
constitutes
custody
and
what
length
of
time
might
be
adequate
to
excuse
the
protection.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes,
it
does,
justice
alito.
the
edwards
rule
provides
two
ending
points
as
it
stands
right
now.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes,
justice
alito,
because
badgering
in
this
context
has
become
a
term
of
art.
it
is
used
in
quotation
marks
in
the
montejo
opinion.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
it
means
an
attempt
by--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--i
think
it
means
returning
in
an
attempt
to
get
a
suspect
to
change
his
or
her
mind.
and
in
this
case,
the
suspect
said
when
first
questioned--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well,
first
of
all,
i
didn't
answer
the
question
properly.
but
the
police,
i
think,
can
run
a
rap
sheet
and
find
out
from
prior
arrests
if
a
person
has
been
taken
into
custody.
and
that
would
alert
a
police
officer
that
that
person
may
have
invoked
their
right
and
they
should
do
more
to
find
out.
and
second--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well,
the
police
officer
should
attempt
to
do
so.
but
i
understand
that--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--yes.
because--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--if
they
have
invoked
the
right,
then
the
second
approach
means
an
attempt
to
persuade
the
person
to
change
their
mind
about
having
counsel.
and
where
they
haven't
done
so
in
the
interim,
that
amounts
to--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--it
should.
but
let's
look
at
this
case,
your
honor,
because
here
this
suspect
was
questioned
about
the
same
allegations
by
detectives
from
the
same
police
department
and
while
he
was
in
custody
continuously.
and
under
those
circumstances
edwards
and
the
rationale
of
edwards
should
apply
strongly.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
i
--
i
believe
the
court
could
adopt
a
type
of
rebuttable
presumption
under
these
circumstances
but
it
shows
the
difficulty
that
courts
would
have
and
police
officers,
too,
in
measuring
degrees,
degrees
of
coercion
or
degrees
of
custody.
i
think
the
foregoing
discussion
has
illustrated
that
prisoners
may
be
under
different
types
of
coercion
in
their
prison
context.
i
just--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--yes.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
right.
the
problems
with
the
break
in
custody
are
a
break
will
exist
in
almost
every
case,
and
even
in
edwards
there
was
a
change
in
custody--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--between
the
police
to
a
state
or
county
jail.
so
there
is
a
change
in
--
a
break
in
custody
right
there.
the
prisoner
was
removed
from
the
police
department
and
taken
to
the
county
jail.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
but
a
--
a
release
from
custody
does
not
signal
that
a
person
who
has
asked
for
counsel
has
changed.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
no,
i
don't--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--there
is
more
of
a
break,
justice
sotomayor,
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
that
person's
choice
to
proceed
with
counsel,
and
if
counsel
is
not
provided
then
the
attorney
is
excluded
from
the
adversary
system
of
federal
justice.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
i
don't
think
anything's
wrong
and
i
don't
think
a
new
rule
is
needed
to
cover
that
situation,
because
it
is
conceivable
that
a
person,
even
in
a
prison
environment,
if
they
have
control,
say
if
they
were
to
telephone
out
or
to
be
free
to
refuse
visitors,
might
not
be
considered
in
custody.
but
in
this
case
michael
shatzer
lived
in
a
prison
environment.
he
was
not
free
to--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--no,
it
does
not,
but
i
think
the
state
has
the
burden
to
show.
the
circumstances--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well,
the
record
does
show
that
he
lived
in
a
maximum
security
prison--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--and
does
not
show
that
he
would
be
free
to
refuse.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
we
don't
know
that
he
could
have
refused
under
the--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--right,
we
don't
know
that.
but
justice
stevens--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--this
shows--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well,
i
think--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--this
discussion
shows
the
problems
with
allowing
such
a
determination
in
the
first
place.
our
position
is
the
definition
of
custody
for
miranda
purposes
must
be
the
same
for
edwards
purposes,
for
a
prisoner
lives
within
confined
space
under
constant
surveillance,
and
with
no
freedoms
and
limited
expectation
of
privacy.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
it
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
language
that
this
court
in
montejo
utilized,
if
a
person
is
in
control,
if
a
person
is
not
in
custody,
they
are
in
control
and
can
shut
the
door
or
walk
away.
if
that's
an
operable
definition,
then
it
did
not
apply
in
this
case,
because
michael
shatzer
did
not
have
such
freedom
of--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--we
--
i
think
we
should.
the
police
officers
have
lived
with
the
edwards
decision
which
says--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well,
in
this
case
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
this
suspect
changed
his
mind.
when
first
given
his--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--i
think,
though--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well
this
court
could
adopt
a
rule
that
the
edwards
protection
--
an
alternative
that
was
raised
in
united
states
v.
green
--
that
the
edwards
protection
extends
to
the
same
case
for
which
the
police
initially
questioned
the
suspect
and
for
which
he
asked
for
counsel.
that's
one
alternative
and
i
submit
that
would
be
more
clear
than--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well,
i
think
from
the
suspect's
point
of
view
it
is
the
same
situation.
he
was
in
the
same
position,
facing
the
police
in
2003
as
he
was
in
2006,
in
that
he
was
accused
of
committing
crime
and
in
the
interim
he
had
no
access
to
counsel
and
i
think
that
this
is
significant
in
this
case,
because
it's
not
clear
that
even
if
he
had
been
able
to
call
out
of
the
prison
he
would
have
had
representation,
because
the
public
defender's
office
was
under
no
constitutional
or
statutory
duty
to
provide
counsel
for
a
person
who's
not
presently
being
questioned
and
who
has
not
yet
been
charged.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
i
agree.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
it
would
be
easier,
yes;
and
it
would
apply
to
this
case
because
it
was
the
same
crime.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
well,
it
does
present
some
tensions
with
roberson.
however,
this
case,
since
it
is
limited
to
the
same
crime,
does
it
extend
as
far
as
roberson
does?
and
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question.
in
this
case,
the
suspect
was
told
--
he
was
advised
of
his
rights
and
said,
"i
have
the
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
and
have
him
present
with
me
while
i'm
being
questioned.
"
"if
i
cannot
afford
to
hire
a
lawyer,
one
will
be
appointed
to
resent
--
represent
me
before
any
questioning,
if
i
wish.
"
those
rights
were
never
fulfilled
in
the
two
years
and
seven
months
they've
had.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes.
they
have
to.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
but
that's
not
the
same,
chief
justice
roberts,
as
having
the
counsel
present
during
questioning.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
if
your
miranda
advice--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--says
that
you
have
the
right
to
have
a
counsel
present
during
questioning,
and
all
that
advice
means,
after
time,
is,
we
will
stop
questioning
you,
then
the
right
has
been
diminished
over
time.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
i
think
the
risk
is
the
same.
the
risk--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--well,
that's
possible
--
well,
the
rationale
that
was
extended
in
the
greene
case
is
that,
if
questioning
is
about
a
different
time,
the
perception,
from
the
suspect's
point
of
view,
that
the
police
are
badgering
him,
would
be
less.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes.
it
does.
now,
a
police
officer
in
that
situation,
really,
has
three
alternatives.
one,
they
could
wait
until
counsel
was
present,
to
be
sure
of
obtaining
a
statement
admissible
in
the
state's
case-in-chief.
number
2,
they
could
take
a
chance,
as
happened
in
this
case,
where
detective
hoover
never
opened
a
case
file
and
didn't
know
that
the
suspect
had
ever
invoked
his
right,
take
a
statement
anyway,
and
run
the
risk
that
it
may
have
to
be
excluded.
or,
three--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--yes.
i
know
that,
but
that
--
this
court,
in
miranda,
was
concerned
with
the
limits
that
society
must
impose,
consistent
with
the
constitution,
in
prosecuting
crimes,
and
i
think
edwards
strikes
the
balance
between
the
individual
faced
in
captivity
questioned
by
interrogators
and
the
state.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
well,
a
person
is
going
to
be
in
custody
in
each
edwards
scenario
at
the
time
they
are
questioned,
so
the
question
is
the
intervening
time
period.
and
what
i'm
saying
is--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--yes,
because
edwards
only
applies
to
custodial
interrogation,
and,
under
these
circumstances,
edwards
strikes
a
balance
in
a
familiar
and
predictable
way.
the
fact
that
these
case
--
this
case
does
not
--
does
not--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--permit
an
exception.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes,
some
form
of
jail.
but
there
is
--
you
know,
chief
justice
roberts
referred
to
the
difference
between
the
--
the
police
station
and
the
prison.
there
are
also
pretrial
detention
centers,
and
there
is
a
range
of
custodial
scenarios
that
--
that
police
officers
might
encounter.
and
advancing
an
exception
to
the
rule
for
a
break
in
custody
presents
practical
problems.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
but
a
transfer
within
--
look.
if
it
doesn't,
then
--
then
it
doesn't,
but
there
should
not
be
a
break
there.
otherwise,
there
would
have
been
a
break
in
edwards
and
in
many--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--but,
from
the
suspect's
point
of
view,
the
only
thing
that
changed
is
the
state
agents
who
temporarily
held
him
in
a
room
for
questioning.
he
was
still
under
custody--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--it's
--
it's
one
possibility,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
workable
rule.
the
circumstances
of
custody
within
an
institution
can
change
dramatically.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
it
doesn't,
justice
stevens,
but
i
think
the
problem
is
it's
a
hard
rule
for
police
officers
to
know.
if
they
go
to
an
institution
to
question
someone,
how
do
they
know
if
that
rule
is
applicable
to
that
prison?
ms.
celia
a.
davis
i
still
think
it
presents
difficulties.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
correct.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
that's
correct.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
exactly.
and,
justice
sotomayor,
i
wanted
to
answer
your
question
about
the
time
period,
where
the
circuit
courts
have
sanctioned
a
break
in
custody.
one
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief,
at
page
27,
is
holman
versus
kemna,
and
a
one-day
break
was
--
was
authorized
in
that
case.
that's
a
very
short
time
period.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
well,
that
was
the
case
that
is
not
entirely
analogous,
but
it's
close,
where
the
question
was
whether
a
statement
was
tainted
by
an
edwards'
violation.
it
also
involved
the
sixth
amendment,
i
believe,
so--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--i
think
it
was
a
release
home.
if
i
recall
correctly,
i
would
have
to
double-check,
but
there
was
a
one-day
period
that
the
court
recognized.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
it
isn't
enough,
justice
scalia,
because
--
and
i
think
this
came
out
of
arizona
versus
roberson.
merely
repeating
advice,
when
the
right
to
counsel
has
not
been
fulfilled,
is
not
enough
because
the
person,
over
time,
might
lose
hope
of
ever
seeing
an
attorney,
and,
certainly,
a
prisoner
has
less
means
than
someone
on
the
street
to
hire
an
attorney.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
but,
if
he
has
asked
for
an
attorney
in
the
past
and,
over
two
years
and
seven
months,
has
never
seen
the
right
fulfilled,
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
pressure
to
cooperate
with
interrogators
has
increased.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
well,
in
this
case,
chief
justice
roberts,
the
sixth
amendment
never
attached
because
this
suspect
had
never
been
charged.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
but
i
think--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--it
did,
but
for
a
prisoner
in
custody
questioned
about
the
same
offense,
the
coercive
pressures
that
were
present
in
miranda
are
present
for
him
as
well.
that's
why
we
think
the
core
holding,
the
core
rationale,
of
edwards
applies
very
strongly
in
this
case.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
i
think
it's
--
it's
possible.
but
in
this
case,
where
the
right
to
counsel
went
unfulfilled
for
that
period
of
time,
a
person
might
lose
hope
that
that
advice
that
he
asked
for
help
would
ever
be
fulfilled.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
go
ahead.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
i
think
it
would
come
out
the
same
way.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
well,
what's
different
is
in
this
court,
i
think
may
be
clear
in
michigan
v.
mosley:
asking
for
help
from
an
attorney
is
materially
different
than
saying,
i
choose
to
remain
silent.
and
the
reason
is
a
person
who
invokes
the
right
to
silence
while
questioned
in
custody
is
in
control
and
chooses
to
stop
the
questioning.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
well,
and
they
treated
it
as
a
clear
invocation
of
the
right
to
counsel
by
documenting
it
in
two
places
and
putting
that
in
the
case
file.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
yes.
i
--
i
think
what
he
said
was,
"i
won't
speak
to
you
without
an
attorney.
"
is
the
same
as
asking
for
an
attorney.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
oh,
anything
over
two
years
and
seven
months.
[laughter]
ms.
celia
a.
davis
that
still
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
we've
argued
that
edwards
continues
to
the
end,
and
the
reason
is--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--it's
all
or
nothing,
justice
alito,
because
--
because
this
court
has
already
said
in
edwards,
we
will
allow
the
police
to
come
back
if
the
suspect
changes
his
or
her
mind
or
if
an
attorney
is
present.
and
those
two
--
those
two
alternatives
are
available
every
day
and
they
are
easy
for
the
police
to
ascertain.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
that's
right.
ms.
celia
a.
davis
that
is
the
badgering.
that
is
the
specter
of
coercion
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
constitutional
right
related
to
miranda
to
have
counsel
present.
and
that
is
the
reason
why--
ms.
celia
a.
davis
--it
is
not
confined
to
time,
justice
sotomayor,
but
the
termination
point
is,
especially
for
a
prisoner,
it's
easy
for
the
prisoner
to
contact
the
police.
just
tell
the
jail
guard
that
you'd
like
to
talk
to
the
police
about
that
investigation.
they
will
make
arrangements
quickly
for
that
to
happen,
i'm
quite
sure,
or
counsel
could
be
present
and
questioning
can
proceed
in
that
instance,
and
those
are
the
reasons
i
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
thank
you.
