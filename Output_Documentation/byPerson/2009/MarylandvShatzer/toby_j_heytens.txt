mr.
toby
j.
heytens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
that
edwards
v.
arizona
is
a
prophylactic
rule
designed
to
implement
the
protections
of
miranda
v.
arizona,
and
it
does
so
by
operating
as
an
anti-badgering
rule.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
colorable
argument
that
mr.
shatzer
was
badgered
into
waiving
his
sixth
amendment
rights.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
breyer,
i
think
there
is
a
few
problems
with
that
approach.
first
of
all,
this
case
is
not
about
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
it's
about
the
fifth
amendment
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination,
and
this
court
has
said
several
times
that
rules
of
legal
ethics
are
not
relevant
to
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
rule.
it
says
that
in
the
burbine
case,
for
example.
that
is
the
case
where,
although
the
questioner
knew
that
the
suspect
had
an
attorney
who
was
trying
to
reach
him,
the
court
said
that
is
not
a
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
problem,
because
we
have
to
look
at
things
from
the
perspective
of
the
suspect.
the
question
is
whether
the--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--counsel
has
something
to
do
with
it,
but
the
court
has
made
clear
going
back
to
miranda
that
when
we're
we
are
talking
about
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
the
only
reason
that
counsel
matters
is
to
help
to
make
sure
that--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
are
not--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
have
--
in
the
fifth
amendment
context,
we
are
interested
in
counsel
only
as
a
derivative
of
his
right
not
to
be
forced
to
incriminate
himself.
it
is
in
this
context
a
purely
derivative
right,
and
we
need
to
look
at
it
from
his
perspective.
i
think
the
reason
that
this
case
matters
in
an
intensely
practical
way
is,
there
are
approximately
a
million
and
a
half
prison
inmates
in
this
country
right
now,
many
of
whom
are
serving
extremely
long
sentences.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that
would
certainly
be
open
to
the
court
to
say
that,
justice
alito.
ultimately,
this
is
a
--
a
second-order--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
and,
justice
scalia,
that's
precisely
why
we
think
the
break
in
custody
exception--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
suspect
that's
what
the
police
would
do,
if
you
ruled
against
the
state
in
this
case.
but
i
think
the
reason
that
you
shouldn't
do
that
is
you
have
to
ask
yourself
what
is
the
benefit
that
such
a
rule
is
trying
to
accomplish.
the
court
has
made
clear
again--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
justice
stevens--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
stevens,
if
he
didn't
want
to
talk
to
the
officer,
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
he
is
in
custody,
justice
stevens,
but
the
premise
of
miranda
is
that
a
person
who
is
given
the
miranda
warnings
can
choose
to
decide
whether
to
talk
or
not
to
talk.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
certainly.
the
reason
this
case
is
important,
justice
scalia,
is
that
because
under
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
decision
no
police
officer,
no
corrections
official,
can
approach
any
prisoner
without
first
attempting
to
determine
if
at
some
point,
to
someone,
at
some
place,
during
the
period
of
continuous
incarceration
he
has
ever
invoked
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
they
can't
approach
him
for
questioning.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
stevens,
the
problem
in
that
situation,
again,
though,
is
that
ultimately
the
only
basis
for
applying
this
presumption
at
all
is
if
it's
appropriate
to
apply
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that,
even
though
we
gave
him
the
miranda
warnings
and
even
though
he
said,
i
am
happy
to
talk
to
you,
we
should
presume
that
when
he
said
that,
that
wasn't
the
truth.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
under
rhode
island
v.
ennis,
you
are
entitled
to
--
to
update
him
on
the
status
of
the
interrogation,
but
you
are
not
entitled
to
resume
custodial
interrogation
unless
there
has
been
a
break
in
custody
or
something
has
terminated
edwards.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
i
think
defendants
may
well
argue
that
it
was--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
scalia,
and--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
think
there
would
be
a
risk
of
that
happening.
i
think
the
other
reason
is
--
again,
this
is
a
second
order
prophylactic
rule
that
the
court
has
adopted
solely
in
order
to
prevent
people
from
being
coerced,
coerced
into
incriminating
themselves
when
they
don't
want
to.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
we
--
we
--
think
the
break
in
custody
approach
is
the
more
appropriate
one
that
will
lead
to
fewer
line-drawing
problems.
it
is
certainly
open
to--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
we
certainly
don't
oppose
the
court
adopting
a
time
rule
in
the
event
that
it
rejects
our
primary
submission.
in
united
states
v.
green,
the
government
argued
for
a
raw
passage
of
time
approach,
and
we
think,
ultimately,
this
is
the
court's
rule,
it's
a
second
order
prophylaxis
rule
that
is
designed
to
implement
the
fifth
amendment,
and
it
would
certainly
be
open
to
the
court
if
it
thought
necessary
to--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
though,
there
are
so
--
as
you
point
out,
justice
kennedy,
there
are
so
many
exceptions
to
that.
we
think
that
would
be
far
longer
than
would
be
necessary
or
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
i
mean--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
i
think
that
is
another
potential
defect
in
adopting
a
pure
passage
of
time
approach,
though
i
think
this
case
is
particularly
easy.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
concluded
that
two
years
and
seven
months
is
covered
by
an
anti-badgering
rule
just
shows
at
some
point
how
far
this
has
departed
from
the
original
purposes
of
edwards
in
the
first
place.
so,
i
do
think
--
i
mean,
the
court
could
simply
say
this
case
is
too
long,
though
at
that
point
the
court
isn't
providing
a
great
deal
of
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
that
have
to
deal
with
these
problems
on
a
day-to-day
basis.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
absolutely.
it
would
also
not
provide
very
much
guidance
to
the
police
to
just
say
two
years
and
seven
months
is
too
long.
and
that's
again
why
we
think
an
approach
that
is
either
--
easy
to
tether
to
the
break
in
custody,
which
as
i
think
i
have
said,
we
think
better
maps
on
to
the
concern
that
motivated
edwards--
let
me
address
for
a
moment
the
catch
and
release
situation.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
the
court
has
mentioned
respect
in
the
choice.
i
think,
with
respect,
ultimately
though,
that
can't
be
the
basis
for
the
edwards
rule.
the
court
has
made
clear
repeatedly
that
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
only
compelling
someone
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
