justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
the
rule
is
three
days?
what
rule
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
you
--
you
are
not
arguing
for
a
seven-day
limit
no
matter
what,
even
if
he
is
held
in
jail,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
a
good
idea
to
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
liked
clear
lines
in
this.
i
mean,
the
police
won't
know
what
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
started
to
tell
us
why
this
case
was
important.
would
you
--
would
you
finish
that?
you
said
there
were--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
--
i
thought
that
you
couldn't
approach
him.
i
thought
that
once
he's
invoked
his
right
to
counsel,
you
can't
approach
him
and
say,
would
you
like
to
talk
now?
right?
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
the
incarceration
is
a
continuation
of
custodial
custody,
to
be
redundant,
if
it
is
a
continuation
of
the
custody,
then
why
wouldn't
asking
him
whether
he
would
like
to
see
visitors
who
want
to
ask
him
about
a
particular
crime,
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation
of
edwards?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
they
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
--
the
--
the
scheme
that
justice
stevens
proposes
wouldn't
work.
you
would
be
violating
edwards
when
you
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
see
interrogators.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
to
the
police
who
have
to
decide
whether
they
can
interrogate
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
mean
badgering.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
ought
to
get
another
term
for
it
then.
[laughter]
questioning?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
attempt
in
this
hypothetical
to
get
him
to
change
his
mind.
they
didn't
know
he
had
made
up
his
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
--
do
we
have
to
ask
him,
you
know,
what
visitors?
i
mean,
is
that
the
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
to
have
any
visitors
today?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says,
i
don't
know.
is
it
my
mother?
[laughter]
or
--
or
do
you
ask
him,
are
you
willing
to
speak
to
investigators
about
a
crime?
and
he
says
what
crime?
i
mean,
how
specific
does
--
does
the
request
for
permission
to
have
visitors
have
to
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
this
rule
to
cut
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
what
is
the
ethical
rule
about
counsel?
i
thought
if
--
if
there's
counsel
in
a
particular
case
and
you
want
to
approach
the
client
about
that
case,
you
can't
do
it
without
going
to
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when
there
is
an
entirely
different
case,
there
is
totally
different
litigation,
you
can't
approach
the
fellow
without
going
back
to
the
counsel
whom
he
hired
for
a
different
case?
i
don't
think
that's
the
ethical
rule.
but
that's
the
effect
of
edwards.
even
if
it's
a
different
crime,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
counsel
whom
he
hired
for
a
different
prosecution?
that
bears
no
relationship
to
the
ethical
rules
of
--
of
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
--
what
if
we
limited
edwards
to
the
same
crime?
that
would
--
that
would
really
make
it
much
easier
for
the
police
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
know
whether
this
person
in
fact
invoked
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
are
being
very
unrealistic.
have
you
ever
known
defense
counsel
who
says,
"oh,
yes",
to
submit
to
the
interrogation?
i
mean
--
you
know,
once
they
are
lawyered
up,
they
are
not
going
to
talk.
you
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
--
but
doesn't
the
beginning
of
the
miranda
warning
tell
him
that
he
doesn't
have
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
i
misunderstand
miranda
warnings?
isn't
he
told,
at
the
very
outset
of
the
miranda
warning,
that
he
doesn't
have
to
talk,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
talk?
is
that
--
is
that
any
less
strong
than
--
than
asking
him
whether
he
wants
to
receive
visitors,
in
general?
or,
in
particular,
a
visitor
who
wants
to
ask
him
about
a
particular
crime?
i
mean,
he
is
--
he
is
told
that
with
the
miranda
warning,
which
he
is
given
the
second
time.
if
you
don't
want
to
talk,
you
don't
have
to.
if
you
want
a
lawyer
to
be
present,
you
are
entitled
to
a
lawyer,
or
--
and
--
and
or,
else,
we
terminate.
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
care
whether
he
gets
an
attorney,
so
long
as
he
doesn't
have
to
talk
to
the
investigators.
that's
the
issue,
whether
he
must
talk
to
these
investigators,
and
he
is
told,
right
up-front,
you
don't
have
to
do
it,
and
if
--
if
you
want
an
attorney
for
it,
we
will
get
you
an
attorney.
otherwise,
we
--
we
will
terminate
the
interview.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
ask
for
an
attorney.
he
just
says,
i
don't
want
to
talk
without
an
attorney.
that's
what
he
says.
he
doesn't
demand
an
attorney.
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
talk
without
an
attorney.
and
the
investigators
say,
okay,
in
that
case,
we
won't
talk
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
right
to
counsel
in
the
course
of
interrogation.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
court
of
appeals
maryland.
in
2003
a
police
detective
went
to
the
maryland
prison
where
respondent
michael
shatzer
was
incarcerated
for
a
prior
offense
and
attempted
to
question
him
about
allegations
that
he
had
sexually
abused
his
son.
shatzer
invoked
his
miranda
right
to
have
counsel
present
during
custodial
interrogation.
so
the
detective
promptly
terminated
the
interview.
shatzer
was
released
back
into
the
general
prison
population
to
continue
serving
his
sentence
and
the
investigation
was
closed.
two-and-a-half
years
later
in
2006,
the
department
received
more
specific
allegations
about
the
incident
with
shatzer's
son,
so
another
detective
reopened
the
investigation
and
attempted
to
interrogate,
shatzer
who
was
still
in
prison.
this
time
shatzer
agreed
to
speak
to
the
detective
without
an
attorney
present.
he
signed
a
written
waiver
of
his
miranda
rights
and
he
made
inculpatory
statements.
shatzer
later
sought
to
suppress
the
statements
on
the
basis
of
the
presumption
of
the
involuntariness
created
in
a
case
called
edwards
versus
arizona.
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
once
a
suspect
invokes
his
miranda
right
to
a
counsel,
a
subsequent
waiver
of
that
right
in
response
to
a
police
in
attempt
at
interrogation
is
irrebuttably
deemed
involuntary.
the
trial
court
refused
to
suppress
the
statements
reasoning
that
edwards
did
not
apply
because
shatzer
had
experienced
a
break
in
miranda
custody,
that
is
interrogative
custody,
between
his
2003
invocation
and
the
2006
invocation
--
interrogation.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
reversed,
holding
that
the
passage
of
time
alone
does
not
end
the
edwards
protections
and
that
even
if
a
break
in
custody
exception
to
edwards
did
exist,
shatzer's
release
back
into
the
general
prison
population
did
not
constitute
a
break.
we
granted
certiorari.
edwards
is
a
judicially
created
prophylactic
rule.
its
fundamental
purpose
is
to
protect
a
suspect's
choice
not
to
be
interrogated
without
counsel
by
preventing
the
police
from
badgering
the
suspect
into
waving
his
previously
asserted
right.
it's
easy
to
believe
that
a
suspect's
waiver
was
badgered
or
coerced
in
the
paradigm
edward's
case.
when
the
suspect
is
held
in
uninterrupted
pretrial
custody
between
the
first
and
second
attempts
at
interrogation,
he
remains
cut
off
from
his
normal
life
in
isolated,
in
an
unfamiliar
police
dominated
atmosphere
where
his
captors
appear
to
control
his
fate.
by
contrast
when
a
suspect
is
released
from
custody
after
the
initial
attempted
interrogation
and
returns
to
his
normal
life
for
some
time,
there
is
little
reason
to
believe
that
his
change
of
heart
was
coerced.
during
the
break
in
custody
he
was
not
isolated.
he
was
likely
able
to
seek
advice
from
an
attorney,
family
or
friends.
he
was
in
familiar
surroundings
and
he
had
learned
from
his
earlier
experience
that
he
could
end
the
interrogation
by
simply
refusing
to
speak
without
a
counsel
present.
applying
edwards
in
that
situation
would
not
further
its
fundamental
purpose.
moreover,
extending
edwards
past
a
sufficient
break
in
custody
would
have
enormous
costs,
because
it
would
prohibit
the
police
from
interrogating
suspects
who
had
ever
invoked
the
miranda
right
to
counsel
in
connection
with
any
offense
in
any
jurisdiction.
the
duration
of
a
break
in
custody
here,
two-and-a-half
years,
was
plainly
enough
to
eliminate
the
residual
coercive
effect
of
the
prior
custody,
but
would
one
year
be
enough
or
one
week?
it
is
impractical,
we
think,
to
leave
to
case
by
case
adjudication
in
the
future,
the
question
of
what
length
break
in
custody
is
sufficient
to
end
the
edwards
protections,
because
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
requisite
police
action,
namely
abstention
from
further
interrogation,
has
been
established
by
opinion
of
this
court
rather
than
by
statute,
we
think
it
appropriate
to
specify
the
necessary
period
of
time.
in
our
judgment
14
days
will
provide
plenty
of
time
for
the
suspect
to
get
reacclimated
to
his
normal
life,
to
consult
with
friends
and
counsel
and
to
shake
off
any
residual
coercive
effects
of
his
prior
custody.
there
remains
a
second
question
in
this
case,
whether
shatzer's
release
back
into
the
general
prison
population
qualifies
as
a
break
in
interrogative
custody?
without
minimizing
the
harsh
realities
of
incarceration,
we
think
lawful
imprisonment
imposed
upon
conviction
does
not
create
the
coercive
pressures
identified
in
miranda.
when
sentenced
prisoners
are
released
back
into
the
general
prison
population,
they
return
to
their
accustomed
surroundings
and
daily
routine.
they
regain
the
degree
of
control
they
had
over
their
lives
prior
to
the
attempted
interrogation.
they
are
not
isolated
with
their
accusers
and
their
continued
detention
is
relatively
disconnected
from
their
prior
unwillingness
to
cooperate
with
the
investigation.
the
inherently
compelling
pressures
of
custodial
interrogation
ended
when
shatzer
returned
to
his
normal
life
in
state
prison.
because
shatzer
experienced
a
break
in
miranda
custody
lasting
more
than
two
weeks
between
the
2003
and
2006
attempts
at
interrogation,
edwards
does
not
mandate
suppression
of
his
2006
statements.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
maryland
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
