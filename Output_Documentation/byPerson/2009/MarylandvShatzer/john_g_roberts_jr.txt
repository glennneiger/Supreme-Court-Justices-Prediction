chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
term
in
case
08-680,
maryland
v.
shatzer.
general
gansler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
without
regard
to
the
time?
a
break
in
custody
of
one
day,
do
you
think
that
should
be
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
it's
repeatedly
done?
you
know,
you
--
you
bring
him
in,
you
give
him
his
miranda
rights.
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
talk.
you
let
him
go.
you
bring
him
in,
give
him
his
miranda
rights.
you
know,
just
sort
of
catch
and
release,
until
he
finally
breaks
down
and
says,
all
right,
i'll
talk.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mean
he
is
not
--
i
assume
you
mean
he
is
not
free
to
leave
the
prison.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
terms,
pehaps
it's
inaccurate,
jail
is
where
you
are
when
they
are
still
questioning
you
and
figuring
out
what's
going
to
happen
to
you.
your
argument
is
when
he
is
sent
to
prison,
he
is
no
longer
in
custody
for
edwards
purposes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
thought
roberson
told
us
it's
not
a
different
question,
that
it's
the
same
question.
roberson
did
not
draw
a
distinction
between
what
crime
he
was
being
questioned
on
the
second
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
heytens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
davis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
--
interrupt
there,
and
i
will
let
you
get
back
to
the
answer.
they
should
attempt
to
do
so.
the
rule
here
does
not
allow
the
police
to
approach
that
person,
a
murder
suspect.
and
you
are
saying
he
cannot
even
be
approached
to
see
if
he
would
waive
his
rights
ten
years
later
because
he
was
--
invoked
the
right
in
connection
with
joy
riding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
was
one
day.
he
said
he
wanted
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
remain
silent
in
the
evening,
and
at
9:00
the
next
morning
they
were
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
i
don't
understand
why
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
hypothetical
was
what
it
was,
because
that
person
obviously
was
not
in
custody.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
miranda
rights
do
not
require
the
police
to
provide
counsel.
they
have
to
mean
--
mean
you
have
to
stop
questioning,
until
the
person
has
right
to
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
one
thing
this
person
knew
from
the
prior
miranda
situation
--
was
2003?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that,
if
he
said,
"i
don't
want
to
talk
without
counsel.
"
the
one
thing
he
knew
is
that
the
police
would
stop
questioning
because
that's
what
they
did.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
miranda
doesn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say,
"in
captivity",
but
you
think
the
rule
applies,
whether
they
are
in
captivity
or
not.
in
--
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
the
person
was
free
for
40
years,
so
captivity
is
not
a
limitation
on
your
--
your
proposed
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose,
if
they
are
in
a
pretrial
detention
center,
they
know
they
are
still
being
looked
at
for
the
crime
as
to
which
they
have
invoked
the
miranda
warnings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
wouldn't
call
that
--
and
i
don't
understand
the
other
side
to
argue
that
that
is
--
there
is
a
break
in
custody
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
agree
with
you.
there
shouldn't
be
a
break
there,
but,
here,
the
situation
is
quite
different.
there
is
a
break
between
jail
for
questioning
and
prison
for
15
years
--
or
whatever
your
sentence
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
a
--
isn't
that
a
sixth
amendment
question?
that's
not
a
miranda
question,
if
he
has
not
been
provided
a
lawyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
it's
the
fifth
amendment
we
are
worried
about,
and
that
is
directed
to
coercion--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
that
is
addressed,
if
you
stop
questioning
him.
you
don't
even
start
questioning
him,
if
he
says,
look,
i
don't
want
to
talk
without
a
lawyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
talking
stopped,
as
it
did
the
very
--
the
first
time
he
was
approached.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
says
--
i'm
sorry--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
you
done
answering?
so
if
he
said,
instead
of
i
want
to
talk
to
a
lawyer,
if
he
said,
i
want
to
remain
silent,
your
case
comes
out
differently?
he
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
lawyer.
he
says,
look,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
all
your
arguments
about
he
hasn't
been
provided
a
lawyer,
there
is
an
ethical
obligation
to
provide
a
lawyer.
those
--
those
are
off
the
table.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
davis.
general
gansler,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
08-680,
maryland
against
shatzer.
