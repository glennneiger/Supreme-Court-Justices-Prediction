justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
rationale
for
the
break
in
custody
that
there
is
a
likelihood
of
non-coercion?
is
that
the
reason
that
you
offer
for
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
but
this
person
was
in
custody
in
the
sense
he
was
in
prison
and
the
brief
said,
oh,
he
was
released
to
the
general
population.
but
the
possibilities
for
coercion
or
pressure
are
very
substantial
in
the
prison.
the
warden
comes
in
and
says:
oh,
your
cell
doesn't
have
a
window.
i
mine,
there's
countless
way
in
which
a
prisoner
in
the
general
prison
population
would
consider
that
he
is
--
that
there
has
been
no
break
in
custody.
i
think
that's
a
very
difficult
rule
that
you
are
proposing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
join
counsel
for
the
state
in
just
not
wanting
to
argue
for
a
time
rule,
which
seems
to
me
the
only
thing
that
would
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
become
apparent,
and
i'm
indicating
that
i
think
the
time
rule
might
have
some
benefits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
give
us
any
--
any
suggestions.
as
--
you
know,
the
state
opens
the
bidding
with
seven
days.
[laughter]
but
the
speedy
trial
act,
with
many
exceptions,
requires
that
you
go
to
trial
within
70
days.
would
that
be
a
benchmark?
