but
if
the
defendant
goes
home,
he
can
contact
a
lawyer.
in
prison
he
can't
do
that.
so,
if
the
whole
idea
is
to
protect
his
right
to
counsel,
then
it
makes
a
big
difference
whether
he's
at
home
or
in
prison.
justice

in
those
cases,
was
there
a
considerable
interval
between--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
just
the
break
in
custody?
a
week--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
enough?
justice

suppose
it's
the
same
officer.
does
--
you
said
in
your
brief
and
just
now
it
was
a
different
officer.
suppose
it
was
the
same
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
could
limit
it
to
the
same
police
department,
the
same
investigation,
so
you
are
not
covering
the
waterfront
of
every
interrogation
about
any
crime,
any
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
--
in
this
case
it's
two
years
and
seven
months.
why
should
the
court
take
that
--
a
period
of
that
length
and
say,
well,
we
are
going
to
now
rule
for
all
future
cases
it
should
be,
say,
six
months.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
make
a
difference?
does
it
make
a
difference?
if
--
we
can
limit
it
to
the
same
case.
but
here,
the
reason
that
the
police
came
back
is
that
they
had
additional
evidence,
and
so
they
wanted
to
ask
him,
confront
him
with
the
new
evidence.
it's
not
the
same
situation
that
it
was
when
he
was
initially
questioned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
he
think,
i
invoked
my
right
to
remain
silent
without
a
lawyer
two
years
and
seven
months
ago,
i
will
do
it
again;
they
will
have
to
stop
questioning?
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
most
likely
mindset
of
the
defendant?
he
knew
that
it
worked
the
first
time.
why
should
it
not
work
the
second
time?
