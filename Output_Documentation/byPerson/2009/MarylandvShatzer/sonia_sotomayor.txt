justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
if
he
asks
for
a
lawyer.
he
said:
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you
without
a
lawyer,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
state
doesn't
provide
him
with
a
lawyer,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
what
gives
him
an
understanding
that
one
will
be
provided
the
next
time
he's
questioned?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
because
we
tell
the
police
they
have
to
stop.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
presumably
they
shouldn't
re-engage
until
the
lawyer
is
present,
correct?
that's
what
edwards
tells
them
not
to
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
this
is
a
different
part
of
your
argument.
this
is
not
the
custody
or
break
in
custody.
this
is
the
time
and
the
fact
that
such
a
prolonged
period
of
time
has
minimized
any
coercive
effect,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
catch
and
release
then
no
longer
--
catch
and
release
is
unimportant
to
you?
there
is
no
meaning
to
edwards
in
that
situation,
because
every
prisoner,
because
he
is
a
captive,
is
questioned
in
a
place
and
then
told
to
go
back
to
his
room.
his
room
happens
to
be
a
locked
cell.
so
he
doesn't
have
the
freedom
to
leave
and
he
doesn't
have
the
freedom
necessarily
to
make
calls
to
discuss
his
choice
with
anyone.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
a
very
different
situation
then
someone
who
is
free
to
go
home.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
he
is
not
in
custody,
when
he
is
in
jail.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
he
can't
leave,
can't
necessarily
use
a
phone
and
can't
confer
with
anyone
he's
no
longer
in
custody.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what's
the
smallest--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
the
hypothetical
you
are
positing
is
an
investigation
about
unrelated
crimes.
we
are
talking
about,
and
i
think
it's
what
justice
ginsburg
was
pointing
to,
it
was
an
invocation
on
this
crime,
on
this
criminal
activity,
not
one
in
another
state
or
another
police
department.
and
so
that's
a
substantially
different
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
the
shortest
time
period
that
any
circuit
court
has
found
a
break
in
custody
in
a
similar
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
between
the
invocation
of
counsel
and
a
requestioning.
you
said
a
number
of
circuit
courts
have
recognized
this
break
in
custody
theory.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
are
days?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
any
are
days?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
that,
but
there
were
two
aspects
to
edwards.
one
was
the
coercion,
but
the
other
was
the
respect
for
the
advisement
of
counsel.
and
so
the
test
that
you
are
proposing
only
addresses
the
coercion
prong
of
it,
not
the
respect
for
the
invocation
of
counsel.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
ask
something?
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
hypothetical
justice
alito
gave
you,
which
is
the
person
is
not
in
custody,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
is
arrested
for
joy
riding;
he
is
let
go;
and
you
are
saying
that
for
20,
40
years
he
is
now
immunized
from
being
reapproached
by
the
police
under
the
edwards
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
advocating
that
no
break
in
custody
ever
stops
the
edwards
clock.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are
now
--
you
are
now
accepting
your
adversary's
point
that
somehow
a
--
a
change
from
a
locked
room
in
a
prison
to
a
different
locked
room
is
a
release
from
custody.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
don't
--
if
we
don't
accept
that
proposition,
isn't
there
a
clear
break
when
someone
is
let
to
go
home?
when
someone
is
released
and
permitted
to
go
home?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
we--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--we
don't
have
a
case.
none
of
the
cases
in
this
area,
where
we
have
applied
edwards,
has
dealt
with
a
situation
with
--
where
a
prisoner
has
been
released
from
custody,
in
any
sense
of
that
word,
i.e.,
sent
home.
in
all
of
the
three
situations
that
i
am
aware
of,
in
which
the
edwards
rule
has
applied,
the
prisoner
has
stayed
in
jail
--
some
form
of
jail.
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
i
have
a
clarification
of
the
facts
for
a
moment?
in
2003,
he
was
in
one
state
facility,
a
sentenced
prisoner.
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
he
was
just
moved
from
one
state
prison
to
another.
he
wasn't
in
pretrial
detention
in
either
of
these
timeframes.
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
are
just
talking
about
a
change
in
facility,
not
in
status?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
were
the
circumstances?
i
don't
recall
the
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
was
the
prisoner
in
a
prison
the
entire
24
hours?
or
was
the
individual
released
home,
that
sort
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--your
adversary
says
that
they
--
he
can't
change
his
mind.
it
has
to
be
a
spontaneous,
you
know,
somehow
they
have
to
be
in
a
room
together
that
wasn't
planned
and
he
has
to
come
up
and
say,
i
am
confessing
out
of
the
kindness
of
my
heart.
the
police
can't
even
approach
him,
according
to
you,
once
he
has
invoked
counsel,
to
ask
him
whether
he
wants
to
change
his
mind.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
point.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
is
no
termination
point,
really?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but
there
was
no
difference
in
those
cases,
as
i
understand
it.
each
of
the
prisoners
was
in
a
particular
room
being
questioned,
and
then
he
was
released
into
a
more
general
room
later.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
brought
back.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
no
difference
between
that
and
a
holding
cell,
a
maintenance
room,
and
being
put
back
into
general
prison
to
go
sleep.
