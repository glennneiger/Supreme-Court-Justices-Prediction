g.

i
know
that
you're
going
to
go
into
the
question
of
how
we
shape
a
rule,
and
i
would
like
you,
and
perhaps
on
rebuttal
your
other
counsel,
to
comment
on
the
following:
i
don't
see
--
as
justice
kennedy
had
a
problem,
so
do
i
have
a
problem
with
anything
that
just
says
break
in
custody,
and
taking
time
seems
fairly
arbitrary.
suppose
you
--
could
you
try
to
shape
a
rule
on
the
civil
situation,
the
codes
of
ethics,
where
you
are
not
supposed
to
talk
to
a
client
who
is
represented
by
a
lawyer?
that's
where
my
mind
is
going.
and
the
best
i
could
do
at
the
moment
is
you
would
say:
when,
due
to
a
breach
in
custody
and
the
passage
of
time,
the
questioner
did
not
and
would
not
reasonably
believe
that
the
suspect
was
looking
for
or
was
represented
by
counsel?
what
i've
tried
to
do
is
take
the
purpose
of
the
civil
rule,
the
ordinary
ethical
rule,
and
then
use
it
to
shape
a
standard.
so
i
would
appreciate
any
comments
on
that
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
quite
a
lot
of
what
i
read
was
about
the
problems
of
counsel.
counsel
has
nothing
to
do
with
this,
nothing
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
--
are
we
interested
in
counsel
or
not?
if
we
are
interested
in
whether
he's
represented
by
counsel,
and
miranda
covers
both,
then
i
would
repeat
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
are
not
interested
in
representation
by
counsel,
then
i
would
withdraw
my
question
and
you
don't
have
to
answer
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
in
case
--
just
in
case
we
don't
--
we
want
to
put
a
time
limit
on
it,
which
i
know
you
don't
want
us
to
do.
i'm
now
thinking
and
i
would
like
your
comment,
if
you
want,
of
a
combination
of
what
justice
alito
said
and
what
i
said,
that
is,
that
there
are
two
parts
to
the
edwards
thing.
one
is
the
lawyer
part,
and
the
other
is
the
incriminating
self
part.
now
the
lawyer
part
would
be
handled
by
shaping
a
rule
based
on
the
rules
of
evidence,
along
the
lines
i
suggested.
and
that
would
give
you
a
time.
and
then
the
miranda
part
could
be
handled
by
saying:
but
the
suspect
retains
the
right
to
show
that
this
questioning
is
badgering
without
the
question
marks.
in
other
words
what
they
are
really
up
to
is
to
try
to
get
him
to
change
his
mind.
now
would
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you're
--
if
you
are
going
to
use
the
edwards,
which
i
think
is
a
good
idea,
as
counsel
part,
which
i
think
is
a
good
starting
place,
you
and
every
other
member
of
the
bar
deals
with
this
problem
every
day
of
the
week.
not
every
day
of
the
week,
but
very
often.
you
know
somebody's
represented
in
a
case,
and
you
know
you
are
supposed
to
talk
to
the
lawyer.
but
eventually
time
passes,
and
then
you
are
probably
free
to
talk
to
him,
because
the
whole
thing's
gone
away.
now
that's
a
pretty
vague
rule.
you
could
make
it
more
specific,
but
the
--
the
bar
has
lived
with
that
kind
of
situation,
i
guess
for
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
can't
we
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
that's
not
what
i
mean.
i
mean
that
the
obligation
to
deal
with
counsel,
you
don't
have,
after
enough
time
passes,
that
it's
no
longer
reasonable
to
think
that
that
individual
either
has
or
wants
counsel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
thought
is,
can
you
use
the
rule
for
lawyers,
which
has
worked,
to
help
shape
a
rule
that
would
work
here?
