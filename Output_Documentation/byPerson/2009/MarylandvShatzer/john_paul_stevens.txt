justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
know
exactly
what
the
miranda
warning
in
this
case
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
did
it
tell
the
person
in
prison
he
could
do
about
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
it
tell
him
how
he
could
get
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
in
prison
and
they
give
you
the
miranda
warnings,
what
would
that
tell
the
average
prisoner
with
respect
to
access
to
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
they
have
provided
a
lawyer
to
him
right
away
if
they
had
--
he
had
asked
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
he
is
in
prison,
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
if
he
thinks,
well,
i'd
like
a
lawyer,
what
can
he
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
on
the
spot,
when
he
is
in
the
room
there
and
they
give
him
the
miranda
warnings
and
he
says,
that
sounds
like
a
good
idea,
what
would
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
miranda
warning
is
a
little
misleading,
isn't
it,
in
that
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
also
say
it
will
be
provided
to
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
not
going
to
be
provided
to
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
he
free
to
leave
the
interrogation
room?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
he
free
to
leave
the
interrogation
room?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
to
say
that
the
breaking
custody,
i
think,
has
many
more
problems
than
time,
but
you
don't
seem
to
place
much
emphasis
on
time.
true,
we
have
to
reach
out
and
find
some
arbitrary
number,
but
after
all,
edwards
is
an
arbitrary
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
wonder
if
you're
right
about
that
premise.
supposing
the
prison
had
a
rule
that
the
inmate
does
not
have
to
see
visitors
and
they
say
that:
somebody
here
wants
to
talk
to
you.
and
he
says:
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
him.
and
if
he
refused
to
talk,
then
if
he
did
talk,
it
would
be
voluntary,
rather
than
the
situation
you
described.
do
i
make
myself
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
carrying
--
carrying
that
analysis
one
step
further,
if
you
are
just
talking
about
people
who
were
inmates
pursuant
to
prior
conviction,
why
wouldn't
the
better
rule
be
that
if
the
inmate
is
given
the
opportunity
to
say
no,
i
don't
want
a
visitor
today,
and
then
if
he
accepts
the
visitor,
you
would
say
he
is
no
longer
in
custody?
but
if
he
says,
i
don't
want
to,
then
he
--
then
he
is
in
custody
and
you
preserve
the
presumption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
--
such
a
rule
would
accomplish
the
benefit
when
he
really
wants
--
willing
to
talk,
he
would
say:
i
would
be
glad
to
talk
to
the
officer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
doesn't
want
to,
he
should
just
say
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
a
little
different
when
the
man
first
comes,
says,
will
you
talk
to
the
officer.
he
can
very
clearly
say
no.
but
if
he
is
in
the
room
with
two
or
three
people
around
in
a
different
setting,
then
he
is
still
in
custody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
true,
because
my
hypothetical,
if
you
told
him
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
the
officer,
and
you
could
produce,
they
could
question
every
--
everybody
in
jail
all
over
the
country.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can't
force
him
to
attend
the
questioning.
but
if
they
give
him
an
opportunity
to
say,
i
--
i'm
a
prisoner,
i
just
want
to
stay
in
the
prison
population
and
not
go
to
an
interrogation
room.
and
if
he
is
willing
to
go,
you
could
question
him.
you
do
not
have
the
example
of
no
possibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
a
different
approach?
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
somebody
who
was
constantly
in
custody
but
for
a
different
reason
than
the
during
the
pretrial
situation.
he
is
in
the
general
prison
population.
what
--
what
would
be
wrong
with
the
rule
that
said
that
a
person
in
that
situation
should
be
advised
that
somebody
wants
to
question
him,
and
he
has
a
right
to
say
i
do
or
do
not
want
to
talk
to
the
visitor?
and
if
he
is
willing
to
talk
to
the
visitor,
then
you
have
to
give
him
new
miranda
warnings
and
you
start
from
scratch.
but
have
the
--
have
the
focus
on
whether
he
is
in
custody
at
the
time
of
the
questioning,
and
say
that
an
inability
to
refuse
to
go
to
the
interrogation
room
would
be
not
treated
as
custody.
it
would
be
treated
as
in
the
general
prison
population.
what
would
be
wrong
with
such
a
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
whether
he
was
given
an
opportunity
to
say
"i
don't
want
any
visitors
today.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
a
question
who
has
the
burden
of
showing
he's
in
custody
or
is
he
free
to
leave.
if
he
has
the
burden,
he
didn't
carry
the
burden
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
can
still
live
in
a
maximum
security
prison
and
say
i
don't
want
any
visitors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
far
as
the
records
show.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
require
us
to
overrule
roberson?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
agreed
that,
if
he
is
questioned
and
he
is
not
in
custody
when
he
is
being
questioned.
if
he
stopped
on
the
street
or
in
his
living
room,
they
can
question
him
there.
that's
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
--
but
wouldn't
it
make
sense
to
treat
the
--
the
change
from
a
pretrial
detention
to
a
general
prison
population
as,
by
itself,
a
no
longer
custody,
provided
he
is
told
that
he
doesn't
have
to
talk
to
people
who
want
to
pay
him
a
visit.
he
could
say
--
they
could
have
a
rule,
say
that
the
prisoner
does
not
have
to
talk
to
everybody
who
comes
--
comes
around,
and
then
you
could
treat
that
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
not
being
in
custody.
wouldn't
that
be
a
sensible
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can,
but,
if
you
say,
as
a
condition
to
--
to
questioning,
he
just
has
to
know
that
he
doesn't
have
to
see
visitors
he
doesn't
want
to
see,
which
doesn't
seem,
to
me,
a
very
hard
rule
to
administer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
have
the
prisoner
there,
and
he
shows
up,
and
then
--
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
