mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
from
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
suppressed
a
statement
that
was
given
by
respondent
following
what
the
trial
court
found
to
be
a
valid
waiver
of
his
miranda
rights
and
following
a
free
and
voluntary
confession.
the
reason
why
the
court
did
so
is
because,
two
years
and
seven
months
prior
to
that,
the
defendant
was
in
a
different
custodial
interrogation
and
at
that
time
invoked
his
right
to
counsel.
we
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
it
is
our
position
that
a
break
in
custody
from
custodial
interrogation
should
be
the
bright
line
that
this
court
adopts
in
order
to
end
the
irrebuttable
presumption
that
this
court
created
in
the
edwards
case.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
your
honor,
we
do
think
one
day
should
be
enough,
as
long
as
it
is
not
in
the
pretrial
detention
category.
obviously,
the
three
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court,
edwards,
minnick
and,
roberson,
all
--
two
of
them
were
three
days,
and
one
of
them
was
one
day,
but
those
defendants
were
in
the
pretrial
detention
status.
so
if
in
fact
a
defendant
is
brought
in,
questioned,
and
then
released
back
to
his
or
her
daily
routine,
and
away
from
the
isolation
of
the
custodial
interrogation,
we
feel
that
that
should
be
the
bright
line
for
a
break
in
custody.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
there
is
parade
of
horribles
of
catch
and
release
and
your
honor
just
went
through
one
of
them,
and
there
are
obviously
a
number
of
hypotheticals
that
one
could
posit.
we
would
suggest
that
the
break
of
custody
would
be
the
end
of
the
edwards
irrebuttable
presumption.
however,
there
are
still
three
responses
to
that.
the
first
would
be
the
defendant
could
still
say
that
his
or
her
miranda
rights
were
not
given
voluntarily
and
willfully.
secondly,
the
due
process
jurisprudence
that
this
court
had
prior
to
miranda
still
is
in
existence,
and
therefore
the
defendant
could
argue
that
that
confession
was
given
in
an
overborne
way,
that
his
will
was
overborne.
but
finally
and
i
think
most
relevant,
because
this
is
sort
of
the
other
side
of
this
case,
is
that
there
has
been
--
since
1982
eight
federal
circuits
and
over
20
states
have
had
the
break
of
custody
rule
in
effect.
and
in
fact
this
court
in
the
mcneil
case,
albeit
in
dicta
and
parenthetically,
assumed
a
break
in
custody
as
the
rule.
there
has
not
been
one
published
opinion,
at
least
that
we
could
find,
that
has
this
--
that
has
that
scenario--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--your
honor,
it
goes
to
--
yes,
this
court
has
said,
most
recently
again
in
montejo,
that
the
reason
for
edwards
is
that
we
want
to
prevent
badgering.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
well,
the
courts
--
the
lower
courts
have
shown
that
there
is
a
difference
between
police
interrogational
custody
and
correctional
custody.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
once
the
person
--
in
our
case,
for
example,
in
the
second
interview,
the
defendant
was
in
what's
called
--
what's
called
a
maintenance
room
in
the
room,
with
a
metal
table
and
the
two
chairs.
it
was
clearly
an
interrogation
context.
when
that
person
is
released
from
that,
some
people
are
habitual
criminals
and
they're
put
back
into
the
general
population
amongst
--
that's
where
they
live
for
that
time
period.
other
people
go
home.
but
the
break
in
custody
for
edwards
purposes
ought
to
end
at
the
end
of
the
interrogation.
now,
could
there
be
an
interrogational
situation
while
the
person's
in
prison?
absolutely.
you
can
envision
a
correctional
officer
coming
to
the
cafeteria
when
there's,
the
public
is
there,
the
public
being
other
inmates,
and
that
would
not
be
deemed
to
be
an
interrogation
atmosphere.
if,
however,
they
cleared
the
cafeteria
and
had
officers
standing
by
the
doors
and
blocking
the
doors
and
saying
no
one's
allowed
to
come
in
here,
that
could
then
become
interrogation
custody.
and
this
court
and
other
courts,
the
courts
all
the
time,
have
to
decide
in
the
edwards
context
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
in
custody
when
the
statement
was
given.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
your
honor
--
well,
first
of
all,
the
defendant
while
they're
in
prison
can
contact
a
lawyer
in
some
circumstances.
for
example,
during
the
two
years
and
seven
months
between
these
two
interrogations
he
could
have
written,
he
could
have
called.
but
let's
say
that
that
was
unavailable
to
that
particular
defendant.
it's
our
position
that
what
edwards
does,
miranda,
edwards,
roberson,
minnick,
it
provides
the
opportunity
to
consult
counsel.
but
the
--
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
custodial
interrogation
situation.
in
other
words,
the
police
don't
have
to
get
somebody
a
lawyer.
whether
or
not
somebody
has
the
opportunity
to
consult
a
lawyer
or
not,
as
long
as
they
are
provided
with
their
miranda
rights,
the
miranda
rights
themselves
are
the
protection
that
the
defendant
has.
we
know,
for
example,
in
this
case--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--the
miranda
warnings
in
this
case
the
judge,
the
trial
judge,
found
exactly
comported
with
the
miranda
warning--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--that
he
had
the
right
to
a
lawyer
and--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--it
didn't--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--it
would
tell
them
they
have
a
right
to
counsel
and
if
they
couldn't
get
one
one
would
be
provided
to
them.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
well,
had
he
asked
for
one,
which
he
did
the
first
time,
what
they
did
there--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--yes.
it's
unclear
from
the
record
whether
they
would
have
or
not.
that
would
be
conjecture.
what
they
do
what
the
bright
line
of
edwards
says
is
they
have
to
stop
asking
questions.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
he
could
--
during
those
two
years
and
seven
months
in
this
case,
he
could
have
tried
to
get
a
lawyer
through
--
either
his
own
lawyer
in
the
case.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
he
would
not
be
given
a
lawyer
by
the
police
at
that
time.
there's
not
a
lawyer
sort
of
waiting
outside.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
well,
i
would
argue
that
it
is
not,
because
he
is
given
the
right.
he
said,
if
you
want
a
lawyer
before
talking
to
us,
that's
fine;
you
have
to
invoke
your
right
to
counsel.
he
invokes
the
right
to
counsel,
they
stop
talking
to
him.
what
he
can--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--yes,
but
he
can
--
there's
a
number
of--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--well,
it
would
be,
your
honor,
if,
for
example,
the
lawyer
in
his
underlying
case
came,
he
could
say,
look,
i
need
a
lawyer,
they're
asking
me
questions
about
this
other
case;
can
you
represent
me
on
that
case?
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
in
2003,
yes.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
well,
what
he
does
understand
from
the
first
time
he
is
questioned
--
and
he
understood
the
rights
because
he
himself
invoked
that
right
to
counsel.
so
he
knew
that
he
could
say
"i
want
a
lawyer",
and
he
did.
what
he
understands
is
the
police
will
stop
questioning
him
at
that
point.
there
is
no,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
jurisprudence
and
this
court's
holdings,
there
is
no
obligation
for
the
police
to
actually
go
out,
nor
would
i
suggest
that
you
want
to
have
that
rule,
to
go
out
and
actually
ascertain,
get
a
lawyer.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
well,
edwards
tells
them
to
stop
questioning.
minnick
says
that
if
they
have
the
opportunity
to
consult
with
a
lawyer
they
still
can't
start
without
the
lawyer
being
there.
but
that
is
a
different
analysis
than
this
because
had
they
asked
him
on
the
second
time,
after
they
read
his
rights
and
he
said,
i
want
a
lawyer,
they
couldn't
keep
going
until
there
was
a
lawyer
present.
he
chose
during
that
two
years
and
seven
months
when
he
had
a
mental
reset
that
he
didn't
need
a
lawyer.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
no,
your
honor.
we
would
still
argue
that
--
in
this
case,
obviously
both
exist.
the
court
could
fashion
a
bright
line
rule.
this
court
has
shown
an
interest
in
bright
line
rules
in
this
area.
and
this
court
could
adopt
a
bright
line
rule
of
a
particular
time
period.
we
are
arguing
the
better
bright
line
rule
would
be
a
break
in
custody.
obviously
a
break
in
custody
plus--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--well,
in
this
case--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--i'm
not
sure
--
the
question
sort
of
posits
two
different
scenarios.
one
scenario
is
when
the
defendant
is
arrested,
they
are
questioned
and
then
they
are
put
into
a
cell.
that
is
a
different
scenario.
that
would
be
a
pretrial
detention
analysis,
which
in
minnick,
roberson
and
edwards
extended
up
to
three
days,
which
we
would
argue
is
sort
of
the
end
of
the
time
line
right
as
it
exists
today.
the
different
scenario,
which
is
in
this
case,
is,
yes,
he
is
locked
up
in
the
general
population,
he
comes
in
for
the
interrogation,
he
is
then
released
back
to
his
daily
routine.
and
at
that
point
our
view
is
that
the
rebuttable
presumption
of
edwards
ends.
and
you
know--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--he
is
not--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
he
is
in
custody
in
the
sense
that
he
is
not
free
to
leave
the
jail,
but
as
in
the
miranda
cases,
he
can
still
be
questioned.
he
is
not
in
correctional
custody,
and
he
is
certainly
not
under
interrogation.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
no,
and
we
are
not
--
we
--
we
accept
that
he
was
in
police
interrogational
status
both
in
2003
and
in
2006
when
he
was
read
his
miranda
rights.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--the
reason
why
i
think
break
in
custody
is
not
as
problematic,
and
this
goes
to
the
justice's
earlier
question
as
well,
is
because
literally
the
year
after
edwards,
1982,
was
the
first
of
the
eight
federal
circuits
that
found
the
break
in
custody
rule.
and
there
is
no
--
they
have
been
able
to
work
with
this.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
not--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
yes,
your
honor.
obviously,
in
different
cases
there's
different
lengths
of
time.
but
if
--
in
justice
kennedy's
question,
if
we
were
going
to
adopt
a
time
limit,
i
--
we
would
suggest,
like,
for
example,
a
seven-day
time
limit.
the
court
suggests
that
is
arbitrary.
the
reason
why
i
would
pick
seven
days
is,
right
now
the
rule
is
three
days,
and
you
cannot
envision
the
situation,
at
least
i
can't,
where
somebody
would
be
held
without
being
presented
for
more
than
three
or
four
days,
so--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--because
right
now,
if
you
look
at
edwards
being
the
next
day,
minnick
and
roberson
being
three
days,
that
that
is
the
only
cases
from
this
court
which
says
when
the
edwards
presumption
goes.
so
we
don't
have
--
whether
--
what
respondent's
rule
would
do
is,
in
our
view,
extend
it
right
now
from
the
three-day
limit
--
now,
many
have
suggested
that's
in
perpetuity.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
if
he
is
held
in
jail
on
his
own
case
--
see,
the
most
difficult
scenario,
in
our
view,
is
one
that
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
here,
which
is
actually
the
green
case
from
the
district
of
columbia,
where
he
is
held
on
his
own
case
in
a
pretrial
detention--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--scenario,
because
then
he
does
have
different
incentives
to
cooperate
or
not
cooperate
with
the
police
and
then
the
question
would
be,
well,
does
that
--
is
the
break
of
custody
there
at
conviction
or
at
sentencing?
and
we
can
quibble
about
that.
we
don't
need
to
get
to
that
in
this
case.
but
if
he
is
held
in
jail
on
another
case,
that's
where
he
lives.
he
is
there
for
10,
15,
20
years,
and
he
is
brought
in,
away
from
the
life
that
he
is
accustomed
to,
and
put
there
with
different
officers
in
a
metal
room--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--well,
i
actually
think
for
--
in
this
case,
with
detective
blankenship
and
detective
hoover,
the
court
should
assume
it's
one
and
the
same.
in
fact,
roberson
said
just
that,
that
within
the
same
department
--
but
it
is
instructive
in
this
sense.
in
respondent's
--
if
respondent's
rule
were
to
be
adopted,
there
is
no
way
that
one
police
department
can
know
what
happened
in
front
of
another
police
department,
in
front
of
another
police
department,
while
that
person
is
being
detained--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--except
for
right
now,
we
live
in
a
world
of
roberson,
where
we
do.
so
in
other
words,
if
a
defendant
invokes
in
california
for
a
shoplifting
case
and
then
is
transported
to
iowa
and
then
to
maryland,
the
maryland
authorities
have
no
idea
whether
he
invoked
in
one
of
the
other
two.
what
is
worse
is
right
now,
since
we
don't
have
a
break
in
custody
rule,
this
defendant,
shatzer
himself,
could
have
invoked
counsel
20,
25
years
ago
in
some
other
state.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
it
is,
though
he
is
not
being
held
on
--
on
that
crime.
he
is
being
held
on
a
completely
unrelated
sexual
abuse
case.
i
mean,
it's
related
in
the
sense
it's
the
same
crime,
but
it's
a
different
case.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
that's
exactly
right,
and
that's
what
creates
the
problem
that
if
defendant
--
if
we
don't
have
a
break
in
custody
rule,
a
defendant
who
invokes
anywhere
at
any
time
is
forever
immune
from
being
questioned
by
the
police,
regardless
of
what
would
be
a
sort
of
a
wholly
irrational
view
and
an
absurd
result,
which
i
think
is
where
we
live
right
now.
and
it
becomes,
obviously,
greater
in
a
world
where
we
have
dna.
obviously,
there
was
no
dna
in
1981,
but
with
these
cold
cases
coming
back
15,
20,
25
years
later--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
know
sort
of
what
the
protocol
of
each
of
the
prisons
would
be,
but
i
would
think
that
if
a
prisoner
did
not
want
to
speak
with
the
officers
that
came
to
see
him
about
a
crime,
the
prisoner
would
be
able
to
say
so
and
has.
and
this
defendant
has
--
has
actually
been
able
to
invoke
that
himself.
if
there's--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--a
break
in
custody
that--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--actually,
all
--
eight
federal
circuits.
i
don't
know
what
the
shortest
is.
but
there
are
cases
that
are
weeks
rather
than
years
that
they
have--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--what's
that?
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
and
with
that,
i
will
reserve
--
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
the
ethics
rules
do
not
apply
to
the
police,
only
to
lawyers,
and
i
think
justice
scalia
hit
it
right,
exactly
right,
where
this
--
he's
actually
--
in
this
case,
he
is
not
represented
at
all.
he
is
in
custody
because
his
case
has
been
concluded.
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
yes,
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
one
second.
and
i
agree
--
and
that's
exactly
right.
the
visitors
in
jail
theory
that
justice
stevens
brought
up:
the
defendant
could
say,
"i
told
them
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
any
visitors,
no
matter
what.
"
"i
don't
want
to
talk
to
any
visitors.
"
"they
dragged
me
up
there,
made
me
go
into
this
room
and
answer
questions.
"
then
you
have
--
while
edwards,
in
our
view,
would
have
already
been
terminated,
you
have
still
the
argument
that
my
--
my
miranda
warnings
were
not
waived
voluntarily
and
freely,
and
moreover,
i
was
denied
due
process.
in
terms
of
the
time
limits
of
the
cases,
in
the
state
of
maine,
stafiali
was
six
hours,
and
the
following
day,
dunkins
v.
thigpen
in
the
eleventh
circuit
was
the
next
day,
following
a
break
in
custody.
now,
those
cases,
the
guy
basically
went
home
in
those
scenarios.
the
confusion
seems
to
be,
in
a
lot
of
the
questions,
regarding
what
is
custody?
we
will
not
--
we
don't
argue
--
we
are
talking
about
interrogational
police
custody,
which
is
different
than
being
in
jail,
lying
on
your
cot,
watching
cable
television.
we
--
this
is
--
in
our
scenario,
the
three
days
that
now
exist,
whereas
no
one
questions
in
the
roberson,
minnick,
and
edwards
cases,
those
three
days
were
pretrial
police
custody
situations.
there
is
no
break
in
custody--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--my
understanding
of
this
case--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--my
understanding
of
this
case,
they
were
in
the
--
sort
of
the
box,
as
we
call
it,
and
then
they
were
put
into
a
holding
cell,
a
cell,
and
then
brought
back
to
the
box.
very
different--
mr.
douglas
f.
gansler
--the
latter
--
the
latter
scenario
is
very
different,
because
that's
where
they
live.
that's
their
daily
routine.
through
no
part
of
the
state,
they
are
habitual
offenders.
they
live
in
the
general
population
of
a
jail,
in
this
case
it
is
medium
security,
not
maximum
security,
and
they
were
put
--
there
were
people
around.
they
have
recess,
they
have
television,
they
have
a
cafeteria,
and
so
forth.
finally,
going
to
justice
alito's
question
regarding
the
time
limit,
where
you
do
it.
this
court
has
the
county
of
riverside
--
obviously,
there's
48
hours
from
presentment
is
the
time.
