justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
couldn't
we
say
that
in
--
in
the
situation
where
there
is
a
change
from
pretrial
status
to
post-conviction
status,
the
edwards
rule
is
no
longer
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
but
it's
simply
a
rebuttable
presumption?
and
that
there
--
that
the
rule
would
not
apply
if
the
prosecution
could
show
that
under
the
circumstances
the
reason
for
the
rule,
the
concern
about
law
enforcement
badgering,
was
not
present?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
change--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
an
area
where
it
is
very
difficult
to
draw
lines,
at
least
i
find
it
difficult
to
draw
lines.
so
let
me
start
you
out
with
an
extreme
hypothetical,
and
i
would
like
you
tell
me
whether
you
think
the
edwards
rule
reaches
this
far.
and
if
it
doesn't,
then
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
why
it
doesn't.
and
what
limitations,
if
any,
on
the
rule
you
would
be
willing
to
defend
as
consistent
with
the
rationale
for
the
rule.
someone
is
taken
into
custody
in
maryland
in
1999
and
questioned
for
joy
riding,
released
from
custody,
and
then
in
2009
is
taken
into
custody
and
questioned
for
murder
in
montana.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
first
questioning,
the
--
the
suspect
invokes
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
now,
does
the
edwards
rule
apply
to
the
second
interrogation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
don't
think
that's
a
ridiculous
application
of
the
rule?
first
of
all,
how
are
the
authorities
in
montana
possibly
going
to
know
whether
this
person
was
interrogated
previously
on
a
crime
for
which
the
person
was
never
convicted
in
maryland,
and
that
invoked
the
right
not
to
be
questioned
without
--
without
an
attorney?
and
you
think
there
is
badgering
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
all
right,
they
run
the
rap
sheet
and
they
find
out,
if
they
do,
that
the
person
was
arrested
ten
years
earlier
in
maryland
and
then
what?
they
try
to
find
the
detective
that
questioned
the
--
the
suspect
in
1999
in
maryland?
and
they
find
out
that
the
detective
is
retired
and
is
now,
you
know,
fishing
down
in
the
florida
keys,
and
they
have
to
track
this
person
down
and
say,
now
do
you
recall
whether
this
person
--
that's
the
rule
you
are
arguing
for?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
pose
you
my
hypothetical
again,
the
same
joy
riding
questioning,
and
then
40
years
later
after
the
person
has
gotten
a
law
degree
and
become
an
entrepreneur
and
made
$20
million,
he's
taken
into
custody
and
questioned
by
the
federal
authorities
for
stock
fraud.
forever,
you
know,
this
right
that
was
invoked
back
in
adolescence
continues
forever.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
there
a
greater
risk
of
badgering
when
the
questioning
is
about
a
different
offense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
you
just
said
we
could
--
you
were
suggesting
an
--
as
an
alternative,
that
--
that
edwards
be
limited
to
situations
where
the
questioning
is
about
the
same
offense.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean,
this
isn't
fanciful.
we
just
were
asked
to
take
a
case
involving
a
statute
of
limitations
issue
for
a
murder
that
was
committed
like
30
years
ago,
and
it
said
suppose
somebody
is
questioned
by
state
authorities
for
a
murder
and
taken
into
custody
and
then
released
and
then,
30
years
later,
taken
into
custody
by
federal
authorities
and
questioned
for
a
civil
rights
violation,
based
on
the
same
underlying
transaction.
you
would
say
the
edwards
rule
applies
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
can
think
of
--
i
can
think
of
at
least
one
situation
in
which
the
court
has
held
that
there
is
a
time
limit
in
which
something
has
to
be
done
in
order
to
comply
with
a
constitutional
requirement.
if
we
were
to
choose
a
time
period
here,
what
would
--
what
would
you
propose?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
would
be
a
serious
--
what
would
be
a
serious
answer
to
that
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
or
nothing.
