as
far
as
the
interests
of
your
client
are
concerned,
is
there
any
functional
difference
between
what
happened
here
and
what
could
happen
very
routinely
even
if
the
board
had
five
members,
namely
that
after
the
case
was
assigned
to
a
three-member
panel
one
of
the
three
members
of
the
panel
became
unable
to
sit
on
that
case,
but
the
remaining
two
members
were
able
to
reach
agreement
so
the
case
could
be
decided?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
a
well-established
practice
on
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
a
three-judge
panel
for
some
reason
loses
one
of
the
members
due
to
a
death
or
resignation
or
recusal,
the
panel
can
continue
to
decide
the
case
if
the
remaining
two
judges
can
agree.
and
--
and
do
you
see
--
do
you
think
the
--
the
situation
is
different
with
the
nlrb
for
some
reason?
or
do
you
think
that
that
--
that
those
decisions
on
the
courts
of
appeals
are
unlawful
as
well?

samuel
a.

i
was
surprised
by
your
answer
to
--
i
was
surprised
by
your
answer
to
one
of
the
earlier
questions,
because
one
of
your
amici
says
that
any
member
of
the
board,
regardless
of
whether
he
or
she
sits
on
the
panel
hearing
a
case,
may
request
that
the
case
be
heard
by
all
five
board
members.
is
that
--
is
that
not
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
amicus
says
that
the
members
of
the
board
not
serving
on
a
panel
are
given
the
opportunity
to
review
draft
decisions,
thus
no
case
will
issue
unless
it
reflects
the
majority
opinion
of
the
full
board.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
that
can
be,
in
effect,
the
opportunity
for
full
board
review
before
a
draft
decision
is
issued
in
final
form;
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
them
to
vote
to
hear
the
case
en
banc
before
it's
ever
issued.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
begs
the
question--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
hasn't
the
situation
that
has
prevailed
now
for
some
time
changed
the
--
the
decision-making
process
of
the
board
in
at
least
two
important
ways?
first,
there
isn't
any
opportunity
for
full
board
review
of
cases.
but
more
important,
if
you
have
only
two
members
on
the
board
and
only
two
members
on
the
panel,
the
process
is
very
different
from
a
panel
in
which
there
were
three
members,
or
in
which
two
members
can
be
supplemented
with
an
additional
member
if
they
can't
agree.
what
are
the
two
to
do?
they
have
to
--
they
have
to
split
the
difference
all
the
time.
and
there
have
been
decisions
in
which
the
members
have
--
basically
have
suggested
that
that's
exactly
what
has
happened.
