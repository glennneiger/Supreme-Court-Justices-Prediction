justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
your
position
that
all
of
the
actions
of
the
board,
including
those
taken
by
the
regional
offices
and
by
the
general
counsel
and
by
everybody
else,
is
inoperative
once
--
once
the
membership
falls
below
three?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
has
a
separate
--
a
separate
authorization
for
these
three
--
three-person
adjudicatory
panels
as
well,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but
that's
a
different
argument
from
the
argument
you
were
starting
off
with,
which,
as
i
understood
it,
was
once
the
membership
of
the
board
falls
below
the
quorum
of
three,
by
reason
of
that,
the
three
--
former
three-member
panels,
of
which
there
are
now
only
two
left,
cannot
act.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
membership
of
the
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
membership
of
the
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understood
that
argument
and
i
thought
that
was
the
only
one
you
were
making.
but
you
are
making
a
broader
one,
that
it
also
happens
whenever
the
--
whenever
the
board's
quorum
disappears.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
regional
offices
can't
function,
of
the
nlrb?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
board
pay
salaries?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
really
reluctant
to
rely
upon
this
first
argument
that
you
are
making,
because
i
really
don't
know
what
it
does
to
all
of
the
functioning
of
the
board.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
that.
would
you
--
would
you
make
that
argument
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
another
difference?
is
it
not
the
case
that
the
decisions
of
these
panels
can
be
appealed
to
the
full
board?
are
they
automatically
final?
can
the
board
not
revise
the
decision
of
one
of
its
panels?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
you
--
you've
got
to
tell
me
more
than
you
believe
in
it,
what
--
what
--
what
is
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
adjudication
is
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
appeal
to
the
full
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
a
totally
different
argument
from
the
one
that
relies
upon
the
size
of
the
board,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
board
were
still
properly
constituted
and
had
a
full
five
members,
if
one
of
the
three
members
to
a
--
a
board
should
die,
it
would
no
longer
be
a
three-member
board
and
could
no
longer
be,
as
your
argument
goes,
the
recipient
of
the
delegation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
are
shifting
arguments.
you
can't
keep
jumping
back
and
forth
between
the
two
arguments.
the
one
is
that
the
appointing
body
has
to
still
be
fully
constituted,
or
at
least
have
a
quorum,
and
the
other
one,
which
i
thought
justice
alito
was
addressing,
is
the
quite
separate
argument
that
the
recipient
of
the
delegation
has
to
be
three.
and
when
it
falls
below
three
it's
only
two.
and
i
don't
know
that
you
have
a
response
to
--
to
--
to
his
point,
with
respect
to
the
latter
argument,
except
--
except
that
it's
a
different
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
is
no
legislative
history,
it
could
be
true.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
use
of
having
a
five-member
board,
then?
i
really
don't
understand
what
--
what
has
been
accomplished--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
have
a
--
you
are
changing,
oh,
we
had
a
three-member
board,
that's
no
good,
we
thought
that's
unfair.
we
are
going
to
make
to
five.
but
then
we
allow
the
five
to
convert
themselves
to
three
for
finally
deciding
all
the
cases.
what
--
what
has
been
accomplished?
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
i
am
really
confused
now.
is
it
or
is
it
not
the
case
that
the
full
board
has
the
power
to
review
a
decision
of
one
of
these
panels?
before
you
said
no;
before
you
said
it's
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
--
that
is
my
question,
whether
they
--
they
can
review
it
before
it
is
rendered,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
review
it
before
it
is
rendered.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
before
the
third
member
no
longer
became
--
no
longer
was
a
member
of
the
board.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
knowing
when
it
gave
it
to
this
three
member
panel
that
it
would
shortly
become
a
two-member
panel,
and
that
thereby
the
board
would
be
able
to
act
with
only
two
members
instead
of
with
three,
which
is
what
the
quorum
requirement
for
the
board
is.
i
must
say
that
seems
to
be
a
very
strange
procedure
when
you
have
a
statute
that
says
the
board
has
to
--
has
to
have
three
for
a
quorum.
when
the
board
sees,
oh,
god,
we
are
about
to
lose
our
third
member,
let's
set
up
a
three-member
panel
with
this
guy
who's
about
to
go
off.
it
will
immediately
become
a
two-member
panel
and
then
we
can
act
with
only
two
members.
that's
wonderful.
it
doesn't
seem
to
you
like
an
evasion
of
the
whole
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
quorum
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
--
don't
you
think
it
is
significant
that
the
--
the
vacancy
clause
that
you
were
discussing
--
where
is
it?
it's
in
(b).
"a
vacancy
in
the
board
shall
not
impair
the
right
of
the
remaining
members
to
exercise
all
of
the
powers
of
the
board.
"
and
it
says
nothing
about
a
vacancy
in
the
group
not
impairing
the
power
of
the
group.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
--
which
buttresses,
it
seems
to
me,
the
argument
that
when
the
group
is
no
longer
a
group
of
three
the
delegation
is
no
longer
effective.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
board.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
say
that
about
the
group.
that's
my
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
the
--
this
whole
passage
distinguishes
between
the
board
and
the
group.
i
mean,
it's
--
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
mean
the
group
when
it
says
"the
board"
and
the
board
when
it
says
"the
group".
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
quorum
for
the
group
should
be
three,
then.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends.
i
mean,
if
shutting
down
is
the
only
way
to
put
pressure
on
congress
to
--
i
mean,
you
may
have
a
congress
that
is
just
delighted
to
have
only
two
democratic
members
left
on
the
board
and
all
the
cases
decided
by
two
democratic
members.
what
possible
incentive
does
that
congress
have
to
increase
the
board
to
--
to
the
level
that
it
should
be?
none.
if
you
want
to
solve
the
crisis
that
you
are
so
worried
about,
the
only
way
to
solve
it
is
to
say:
boy,
you
know,
there
is
--
it's
armageddon
coming;
we
are
going
to
not
be
able
to
act
at
all.
that
would
solve
the
crisis.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
much
more
impressed
by
--
by
your
opponent's
assertion,
which
i
don't
think
you
have
contradicted,
that
for
many
years
whenever
there
was
a
death
in
one
of
the
three-member
panels,
that
panel
was
reconstituted.
a
new
person
was
appointed,
instead
of
just
letting
it
continue
to
operate
with
only
two.
doesn't
that
mean
something?
doesn't
that
suggest
that
these
panels
were
viewed
by
the
board
as
requiring
three
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
never
did
it
when
they
had
a
full
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
whenever
there
was
a
death
of
one
of
the
members
of
a
three-judge
panel
or
a
three-member
panel,
they
filled
it
and
the
panel
did
not
operate
with
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
could
have,
even
though
the
quorum
provision
was
just
as
it
is
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
panels
did
not
operate
with
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
--
do
we
have
any
notion
when
--
when
the
board
will
reduce
to
one?
[laughter]
when
--
when
--
when
is
one
of
the
two's
term
over?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
this
year.
at
which
point
there
will
be
some
pressure
on
congress,
i
guess,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
just
the
--
just
the
representation
cases,
not
the
unfair
labor
practice
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
i
understand.
