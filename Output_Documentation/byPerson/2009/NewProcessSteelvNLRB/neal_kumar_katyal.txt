mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
that
the
plain
text
controls
this
case
and
there
are
three
features
to
that
text.
first,
section
153(b)
permits
delegation
of
any
or
all
of
the
board's
power
to
three
or
more
members.
second,
that
section
sets
out
a
general
quorum
rule
of
three
members.
and
third,
as
justices
alito
--
justices
alito,
kennedy
and
ginsburg
have
pointed
out,
there
is
the
phrase
"except
that"
in
the
rule,
a
special
quorum
provision
that
sets
up
panel
quorums
at
two
members.
and
in
this
case,
faced
with
a
vacancy
crisis,
the
board
validly
delegated
its
powers
in
december
2007
to
a
three-member
panel,
and
petitioners
have
never
contested
otherwise.
rather,
they
argue
that
when
the
board
dropped
it
down
to
two
members--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
true.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it's
precisely
what
was
--
what
the
text
allows,
because
it's
not,
justice
scalia,
simply
a
three-member
quorum
requirement.
it's
a
three-member
quorum
requirement,
"except
that".
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
is
the
same
group
of
people
that
were--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
justice
stevens,
the
language
is
written
in
the
past
tense.
it's
10a.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
"of
any
group
designated
pursuant
to.
"
the
first
sentence.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
group
was
designated
on
december
20,
2007,
and
that
met
the
requirements
of--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
--
and
with
respect
to
2
years
later,
i
submit
to
you
that
that
penultimate
sentence
in
153(b)
is
met.
that
is
a
designated
group
pursuant
to
the
first
sentence.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
sure,
i
think
you
could
say
something
like
constitute
a
--
that
two
members
shall
constitute
a
quorum
of
any
group
that
continues
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
first
sentence
thereof,
or
something
like
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
so
let
me
say
a
few
things
about
that.
the
first
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
the
first
thing
to
say
about
that
argument,
justice
breyer,
and
it's
one
that
justice
scalia
brought
up
to
my
friend
before--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it
is
a
totally
different
argument.
it
really
does
rest
on
the
first
sentence
of
153(b).
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
my
friend
admitted,
it's
a
totally
new,
different
argument.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it's
not
in
the
question
presented.
it's
not
before
the
court.
but
were
the
court
interested
in
it,
i
do
think
that
the
language
of
the
quorum
provision,
"quorum"
meaning
a
number
sufficient
to
transact
business,
is
the
most
relevant
language,
and
that
suggests
that
two
is
enough
so
long
as
you
have
that
initial
delegation
to
a
group
of
three
and
then
one
member
drops
off.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
--
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
don't
think
so.
the
--
the
language
is
"a
vacancy
in
the
board
--
in
the
board
shall
not
impair
the
powers
of
the
remaining
members
of
the
board.
"
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
of
the
board.
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
but
by
definition,
justice
scalia,
the
members
that
had
been
delegated
this
power
on
december
20th
are
members
of
the
board.
and
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
simply
extraneous
actors.
and
so
the
vacancy
clause,
i
think--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
it
--
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
distinction.
i
think
that
there
when
they
say
the
board,
it
by
definition
includes
the
group,
because
that
is
part
of
the
board.
they
aren't
extraneous
individuals.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
quorum
--
well,
except
that,
justice
scalia,
it
says
--
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
quorum
is
actually
two.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
if
--
if
the
initial
delegation
did
give
any
and
all
of
the
powers
to
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
then
--
then
i
take
it,
yes,
they
could
exercise
that
delegation.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
under
the
statute.
now,
there
may
be
other
problems
with
it.
so
153(a),
which
is
found
in
our
brief,
in
our
government
brief
at
page
10a,
sets
out,
for
example,
removal
for
cause.
and
if
some
members
of
a
group
were
somehow--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
i
suppose
that
--
i
mean,
it's
not
presented
here
but
yes,
i
suppose
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
underscores
that
the
statute
itself
can't
control
all
of
those
problems
and
whether
you
set
the
quorum
at
three
or
two,
even
if
you
have
a
full
board
of
five,
you
can
have
these
machinations
that
are
potentially--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
that
the
purpose,
as
the
legislative
history
reveals,
and
it's
set
out
in
our
brief,
was
to
increase
efficiency
and
to
have
overlapping
panels
adjudicating
cases.
i
do
think
that
there's
a
--
there's
ways
to
prevent
your
situation
from
happening;
that,
and
they
include
not
just
removal
for
cause,
which
i
think
this
would
be
the
paradigmatic
case
if
three
members
of
the
body
were
trying
to
cut
out
two
members
from
doing
their
job.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
succeeding,
absolutely.
and
i
think--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
would
be
the
president.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
then
you
would
have
other
--
you
would
have
other
checks
as
well.
if
you
had
one-party
government
and
all
of
these
factors
aligning
in
the
way
you
are
suggesting,
you
would
have
the
possibility
that
the
circuit
court's
review
under
160(f)
might
come
into
play,
i
mean,
because
each
board
decision
can
be
potentially
appealed
to
a
circuit
court.
there
is
budgetary
processes
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
don't
think
the
statute
itself
constrains
it--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--under
either
my
friend's
reading
or
mine.
i
think
that
rather,
it
is
a
matter
of
etiquette,
practice,
tradition,
and
all
sorts
of
institutional
checks
that
are
laced
into
the
way
in
which
the
board--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
--
i
think,
justice
breyer,
that
the
board
traditionally
doesn't
engage
in
much
rulemaking.
it
does
make
its
decisions--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
i
do
agree
that
--
that
at
stake
here
is
the
potential
to
decide
cases.
now,
when
you
mention
the
taft-hartley
act,
i
think
that
that
legislative
history
is
important
for
a
different
reason,
which
is
up
in
--
from
1935
to
1947,
and
this
is
set
out
in
footnote
1
of
our
brief,
that
board
decided
over
460
cases
as
a
two-member
body.
there
was
a
vacant
third
position.
and
there
were
2
years
of
debate,
contentious
debate,
as
you
alluded
to
before,
about
taft-hartley,
and
yet
they
left
that
piece
intact.
they
permitted
two-member
bodies
to
decide
these
cases.
and
so
to
the
extent
legislative
history
is
relevant
for
members
of
the
court,
we
suggest
it
strongly
suggests
that
what
the
board
did
here,
faced
with
this
vacancy
crisis,
mirrors
what
happened
between
1935
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--sir,
they
are
set
out
at
page
28
of
our
brief.
they
are
united
states
v.
wyder,
the
two
donovan
cases.
i
think
it
is
a
long-established
principle
that
principal/agent
relationships,
which
we
don't
think
necessarily
apply
to
this
case,
but
even
did
you
--
even
were
you
to
disagree,
as
the
premise
of
your
question
suggested,
that
government
delegations
survive
the
loss
of
that
principal.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
--
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
kennedy,
those
--
that's
a
different--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
that's
a
different
point.
what
i'm
saying
and
what
these
cases
say
is
that,
for
example,
when
an
attorney
general
designates
their
power
to
--
the
wiretap
authority
to
a
subordinate,
an
assistant
attorney
general,
and
then
that
attorney
general
leaves
office,
that
wiretap
authority
nonetheless
continues
in
the
subordinate
until
it
is
revoked
by
a
successor.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
alito,
i
am
not
here
suggesting
that
the
two-member
board
is
ideal
or
equivalent
or
optimal
to
a
--
an
optimal
thing.
congress
set
out
five.
but
faced
with
a
vacancy
crisis
and
shutting
down
the
board
entirely,
i
think
the
board
did
the
prudent
thing
here
by
continuing
to
operate,
continuing
for
these
800
or
so
days
to
decide
these
cases.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
do
think
that
congress
had
before
it
a
well
--
it
was
well-known
that
over
460
times
the
board
had
decided
cases
with
only
two
members,
with
the
third
being
vacant.
and
i
think
that's
what--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--as
opposed
to
shutting
down
the
entire
board,
yes,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that's
the
purpose
of
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
the
politics
in
armageddon
could
cut
different
ways,
depending
--
i
mean,
these
are
nomination
battles
that
are
focused
on
individual
personalities.
and,
justice
scalia,
the
only
empirical
evidence
we
have
--
this
is
not
the
first
time
the
board
has
done
this,
contrary
to
my
friend's
suggestion
earlier.
in
2005,
the
board
was
faced
with
the
exact
same
situation.
the
board
was
going
to
go
down
to
two
members.
they
decided
to
do
the
exact
same
delegation
and
give
--
give
all
the
powers
to
a
group
of
three,
and
four
days
later,
congress
fixed
the
problem
with
the
president.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no,
it
suggests
that
they
thought
three
was
optimal,
where
it
was
--
where
they
could
get
three
bodies.
but
here,
when
they
only
have
two
--
and
again,
faced
with
shutting
down
and
not
deciding
the
lion's
share
of
cases,
which
aren't
the
controversial
ones
that
give
rise
to
the
disagreement,
justice
alito,
that
you
were
positing
--
they've
decided
to
go
and
do
it
--
and
do
their
business
and
try
and
resolve
these.
and
they
have
done,
i
think
--
the
corpus
reveals
a
really
remarkable
job
at
reaching
agreement
in
a
large
number
of
cases
on
the
basis
of
existing
precedent.
are
these
decisions--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
believe
that
there
is
586
or
so
decisions
that
they
have
rendered,
and
of
those
they
have
set
aside
about
approximately
70.
it
was
65
as
of
a
few
days
ago
and
it's
gone
up,
because
they
involve
questions
about
overturning
precedent
or
novel
issues,
and
so
they
haven't
reached
agreement
in
those.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
if
--
if
--
if
the
board
is
disabled?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
if
there
is
--
if
there
is
no
board,
then
i
take
it
the
cases
would
get
stuck
after
the
alj.
there
is
nothing
to
take
exception
to,
and
so
i'm
not
sure
they
could
go
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
the
statute,
160(f),
i
think,
doesn't
permit
review
from
an
alj
decision
directly
up.
it
permits
review
only
of
the
board's
decisions.
and
if
there
is
no
board
decision,
then
presumably
these
cases
get
stuck
until
we
have
a
three-member
quorum.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
the
--
the
board
only
went
down
to
two
members
as
a
whole
starting
in
1993.
it
has
happened
four
times:
in
1993
for
2
months;
in
2001,
i
believe
for
1
month;
in
2005
for
only
a
few
days.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
460
cases
were
between
1935
and
1947.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
in
--
in
--
in
1993
and
in
2001,
the
board
didn't
do
this,
because
those
were
short
periods
of
time.
in
2005,
they
did
do
precisely
what
they
did
here,
but
congress
resolved
the
situation,
so
there
are
only
about
6
cases
decided
in
that
4-day
period.
and
now
from
2007
to
now,
approximately
586
cases
or
so
have
been
decided.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
they
never
delegated--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
we
are
not
standing--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it
could
have,
but
it's
not--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
it's
not
optimal,
justice
scalia,
to
have
two.
but
if
--
if
the
choice
is
shutting
down
or
going
with
two,
the
board
made
the
choice
in
this
circumstance
to
go
with
more.
and,
justice
breyer,
you
had
mentioned
before
the
change
in
the
word
"except
that",
and
i
do
think
that
that
is
crucial
language,
because
that
is
a
subordinating
conjunction.
and
what
it
does
is
essentially
modify
that.
the
two-member
quorum
language
modifies
what
happens
before,
the
"at
all
times"--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--precisely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
precisely
correct.
you
need
it
grammatically
because
otherwise
if
you
didn't
have
something
like
that,
it
would
suggest
that
the
panel
quorum
would
be
three
as
well.
but
--
but
the
language
is
quite
specific
on
this
and,
contrary
to
what
the
d.c.
circuit
found,
"at
all
times"
is
modified
by
that
subordinating
conjunction
in
the
phrase
that
follows.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
--
the
alj
is
appointed
by
the
board
and
they
essentially
write
tentative
decisions
that
the
board,
as
i
understand
it,
can
approve
or
disapprove.
exceptions
can
be
taken
by
litigants
up
to
the
board.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
--
and
this
goes
to
justice
scalia's
first
question
of
the
argument,
i
--
i
think
that
it's
possible.
i
think
that
there
is
--
the
d.c.
circuit's
reasoning
is
--
potentially
could
be
read
so
broadly
as
to
say
that
the
entire
board
goes
poof
and
everything
under
it,
including
the
salaries.
i
think
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
--
to
write
a
decision
like
that,
we
would
try
to
look
to,
as
you
mentioned
before,
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
and
the
specific
language
of
the
delegations
to
the
alj's
and
the
specific
language
to
the
general
counsels,
to
try
to
see
if
there
is
a
way
to
preserve
all
of
the
board's
action
in
this
circumstance.
of
course,
that
isn't
before
the
court
at
this
point,
but
i
understand
that
the
dramatic
consequences,
potentially
dramatic
consequences
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
ruling,
may
inform
the
judgment.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
in
the
absence
of
any
further
confirmations
or
other
appointments,
one
of
the
members,
member
schaumber,
will
leave
on
august
27th
of
this
year.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
there
will.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
there
are
three
nominees
pending
right
now.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes.
and
they
have
been
pending.
they
were
named
in
july
of
last
year.
they
were
voted
out
of
committee
in
october.
one
of
them
had
a
hold
and
had
to
be
renominated.
that
renomination
took
place.
there
was
a
failed
quorum
--
a
failed
cloture
vote
in
february.
and
so
all
three
nominations
are
pending.
and
i
think
that
underscores
the
general
contentious
nature
of
the
appointment
process
with
respect
to
this
set
of
issues.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
--
the
recess
appointment
power
can
work
in
--
in
a
recess.
i
think
our
office
has
opined
the
recess
has
to
be
longer
than
3
days.
and
--
and
so,
it
is
potentially
available
to
avert
the
future
crisis
that
--
that
could
--
that
could
take
place
with
respect
to
the
board.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
