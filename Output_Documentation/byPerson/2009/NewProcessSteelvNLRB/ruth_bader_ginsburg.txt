justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
act
does
two
things.
first,
it
said
that
the
full
board
can
delegate
full
powers
to
any
three-member
group.
that
was
step
one,
and
that
was
done
here.
and
then
it
says
there's
this
rule
that
a
quorum
is
three,
but
then
it
said:
except
as
to
one
of
these
three-member
groups
that
has
been
designated,
except,
and
there
the
quorum
is
two.
so
why
doesn't
the
statute
answer
the
question
that,
yes,
a
quorum
is
three,
except
when
it's
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
an
agent
of
the
board
because
the
three-member
group
that
has
a
quorum
of
two
has
the
full
powers
of
the
board.
so
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
three-member
group
that
has
a
quorum
of
two
being
an
agent
of
the
board.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
where
does
the
statute
make
that
three-member
group
with
a
quorum
of
two,
a
quorum
of
two,
an
agent?
it
says
they
may
be
designated
to
exercise
any
and
all
powers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
d.c.
circuit
i
think
was
the
source
of
your
opening
argument
because
they
said
when
the
number
drops
below
three
there
is
no
board,
and
i
guess
that's
what
your
opening
argument
was
based
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
have
been
situations
before
where
the
board
dwindled
to
two
members.
is
this
the
first
time
that
the
board
has
continued
to
adjudicate
the
cases
that
they
can,
or
when
there
were
prior
periods
with
only
two
did
the
board
continue
to
adjudicate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
heard
an
initial
--
an
initial
decision.
but
just
--
the
review
of
the
panel
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
could
have
initially
a
panel
of
five,
but
that
would
not
be
reviewing
the
panel
of
three?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
different
from
the
practice
that
some
courts
of
appeals
follow
of
circulating
a
panel
decision
to
the
full
court
some
days
before
it's
issued
to
the
public?
that
doesn't
put
the
non-panel
members
on
the
panel.
is
this
practice
that
you
are
describing
the
same
or
is
it
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
quite
different
from
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc.
the
practice
of
circulating
the
opinion
does
not
put
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
on
the
panel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
point
that
official
acts
done
stay
in
effect
even
though
the
official
is
gone,
until
the
official's
successor
in
office
is
appointed
and
that
successor
can
remand
the
instruction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
--
how
has
it
--
how
has
it
worked?
and
i
understand
that
they
are
not
dealing
with
controversial
decisions.
how
many
decisions
are
there
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
--
there
are
two
nominees,
are
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
three?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except
that
it
said
"except".
[laughter]
at
all
times
"except".
