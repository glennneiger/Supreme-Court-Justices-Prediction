except
--
may
i
just
interrupt
a
bit,
just
on
the
"except"
clause
at
the
very
bottom.
when
you
are
talking
about
individual
cases
it's
easy.
sure,
one
member
dies;
the
other
two
can
finish.
but
you
are
talking
about
long-run
governance
of
the
board.
the
two
members
--
two
members
shall
constitute
a
quorum
of
any
group
designated
pursuant
to
the
first
sentence.
now,
2
years
later,
after
--
what
is
the
group
designated
pursuant
to
the
first
sentence
at
the
time
of
the
decision
2
years
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
no
such
group
exists
at
the
time
that
that
power
is
being
exercised.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
not
the
past
tense.
"two
members
shall
constitute
a
quorum.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
no
group
around
at
the
time
they're
--
that
this
case
is
being
decided,
that
was
designated
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
--
your
inquiry
is
focusing
on
what
happens
2
years
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
only
is
the
two-member
board
not
--
not
ideal.
do
you
think
it
is
reasonably
possible
that
congress
back
in
1947
contemplated
this
particular
problem
and
would
have
solved
it
the
way
you
suggest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
always
when
there
is
--
there
is
in
existence
three
people
who
could
have
served.
but
the
particular
problem
we've
got
now,
going
on
for
2
or
3
years:
all
the
decisions
by
two
members.
do
you
think
congress
would
have
authorized
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
december
of
2007,
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
one
vacancy
and
four
members.
the
board
expected
two
more
members,
two
more
vacancies
at
the
end
of
the
year
just
a
few
away,
which
would
leave
the
board
with
only
two
members.
too
few
to
meet
the
quorum
requirement
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
requires
three
members.
the
four
sitting
members
attempted
to
preserve
the
board’s
ability
to
function
by
delegating
all
of
the
board’s
powers
to
a
group
of
three
members
with
the
expectation
that
when
the
term
expired
for
one
of
the
group
members
a
few
days
later,
the
remaining
two
members
could
continue
to
issue
decisions,
as
a
quorum
of
that
three-member
group.
for
the
next
27
months,
the
board
issued
decisions
with
only
two
members.
petitioners
sought
review
of
two
of
those
decisions
challenging
the
authority
of
the
two
member
board
to
act.
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
that
the
government
including
that
the
two
members
could
properly
act
for
the
entire
board.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
circuit
split
on
this
issue.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
two
remaining
board
members
could
not
exercise
the
board’s
authority.
the
portion
of
the
act
that
allows
the
board
to
delegate
its
authority
to
a
group
of
no
fewer
than
three
members
must
be
read
to
require
that
the
group
maintain
a
membership
of
three
in
order
to
continue
to
exercise
the
board’s
powers.
the
contrary
reading
allowing
two
members
to
exercise
authority
as
a
quorum
of
the
defunct
three-member
group
would
allow
permanent
circumvention
of
a
quorum
requirement
for
the
board
which
demands
three
members.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg,
justice
breyer
and
justice
sotomayor
have
joined.
