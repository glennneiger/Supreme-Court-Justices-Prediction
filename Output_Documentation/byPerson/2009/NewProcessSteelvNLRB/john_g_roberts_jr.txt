chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
08-1457,
new
process
steel
v.
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
richie.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
only--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--only
if
a
majority
of
the
board
wants
to
do
that,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
member
of
the
full
board
can
overturn
a
group
delegation,
in
other
words,
and
hear
the
initial
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
one
board
member
wants
to
do
that
and
four
don't?
what
happens?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
member
wants
to
review
the
group's
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
counsel,
if
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
go
ahead;
finish.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
--
let's
say
the
board
delegates
to
a
group
the
authority
to
act
as
the
board
until
december
31st,
2010.
and
on
december
30th,
2010,
the
group
delegates
to
itself
because
it's
acting
as
the
board
the
authority
to
act
until
december
31,
2011.
is
that
valid?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
the
powers
of
the
board
until
december
31st.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
a
delegee
can
delegate
to
itself
the
full
authority
of
the
--
the
master
in
the
master
--
agent
relationship?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no;
they
are
just
--
you
know,
they
make
the
distinction
that
the
board
should
continue
to
function.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
their
original
delegation
was
limited
to
2010--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they,
acting
as
a
board,
get
to
delegate
to
themselves
as
the
group
the
authority
to
go
beyond
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
what
if
the
board,
consisting
of
five
members
--
let's
say
three
democrats
and
two
republicans
--
the
three
democrats
delegate
to
a
group
the
authority
to
act
as
a
board.
they
designate
themselves
as
the
members
of
the
group.
they
have
at
that
point,
authorized
themselves
to
act
as
the
board
with
as
little
as
two
members,
even
though
they
couldn't
have
done
that
as
members
of
the
board.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
the
whole
--
even
though
the
whole
purpose
of
expanding
from
three
to
five
was
to
ensure
that
more
than
two
are
required
for
the
board
to
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
trying
to,
but
succeeding
in
doing
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
it
depends
upon
who
would
remove
them
for
cause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
who
would
remove
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
he's
perfectly
content
to
have
two
democrats?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
there
is
nothing
to
constrain
--
if
you
have
three
democrats,
three
--
or
two
republicans
or,
of
course,
the
other
way
around,
nothing
to
constrain
them
from
acting
fully
as
the
board
with
only
two
--
two
democrats?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
actually
happens
on
--
on
the
ground?
somebody
complains
about
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
the
board,
and
let's
say
the
petitioner
prevails
and
the
board
can't
function.
what
happens
next?
is
there
--
i
don't
know
if
there
would
be
a
review
or
not,
but
can
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
assume
there
is
no
board.
as
you
say,
the
--
the
problem
that
would
happen
if
you
don't
prevail?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
recess
appointment
power
doesn't
work
why?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
richie,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
statute
of
limitations
at
least
be
told
during
the
period
when
they
can't
do
anything?
i
suppose
that's
a
different
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
does
however
have
our
next
announcement
case
08-1457;
new
process
steel
versus
the
national
labor
relations
board.
