but
isn't
that
tied
to
a
quorum
for
the
board
as
a
whole
to
act?
once
it's
delegated
a
responsibility
to
a
three-member
board,
it's
already
said,
unless
it
takes
another
vote,
that
it's
going
to
let
those
three
people
decide.
it
has
--
i
understand
the
word
"delegated"
to
mean
it's
given
over
its
power
to
a
subgroup.
if
it
wants
to
take
it
back,
it
needs
a
quorum
to
do
that.
that's
what
i
understand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
problem
is
that
that
exists
whether
we
read
your
rule
or
not
in
the
way
you
want.
you
have
--
you've
conceded
that
a
three-member
board
could
lose
a
member,
a
three-member
group
could
lose
a
member
and
its
acts
still
be
binding,
as
long
as
you
say
there
is
--
there
is
three
members
on
the
full
board.
but
this
lack
of
opportunity
for
dissent
exists
any
time
there
is
a
vacancy.
you
just
don't
like
the
system.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
you
are
now
saying
that
the
group
always
has
to
be
three
members?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
somebody
can't
die,
leave,
recuse
themselves
from
that
group
without
invalidating
the
actions
of
that
subgroup.
where
in
the
statute
do
you
read
that
limitation
when
it
says
a
quorum
of
two
is
okay
to
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
group.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
group
is
not
defined
as
three
or
more
people.
it's
defined
as
three.
the
board
is
defined
as
three
or
more.
the
group
is
defined
as
three.
so
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
confused.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
see.
