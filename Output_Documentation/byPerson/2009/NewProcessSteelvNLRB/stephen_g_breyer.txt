justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
should
--
you
should
have
a
very
direct
answer
to
this
question.
were
you
finished,
because
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
that
train
of
thought?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
--
can
you
--
if
you
are
right,
it
seems
to
me
you
should
have
a
very
clear,
concise
answer
to
the
question
that
i'm
just
going
to
ask
you.
and
this
is
the
question:
imagine
that
there
was
no
delegation,
none.
now
we
have
five
members;
is
that
right?
one
of
them
dies.
so
there
is
a
vacancy.
now,
can
the
remaining
four
exercise
the
board's
power?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
clearly.
okay.
so
what
is
the
difference
between
the
situation
i
just
described
and
this
situation
where
the
board
simply
delegated
its
power
to
three
people
and
one
of
them
dies?
what's
the
difference?
i
can't
find
any
difference
in
the
language.
so
what
is
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
except
that
two
members
shall
constitute
a
quorum
of
any
group
designated
pursuant
to
the
first
sentence,
which
says
"the
board
is
authorized
to
delegate
to
any
group
of
three
all
of
the
powers
which
it
may
itself
exercise.
"
so,
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know
that,
but
i'm
asking
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
except.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
is
the
reason
--
i
now
see.
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
the--
vacancy
clause
applies
to
the
full
board
but
not
to
the
group.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
now,
got
that
answer.
and
now
i
see
how
you
could
read
the
statute
that
way.
so,
now
i
would
like
--
and
that
would
be
in
your
favor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and,
therefore,
i
would
like
to
know,
since
you
could
also
read
it
the
other
way,
why
should
it
be
read
your
way?
i
mean,
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
reasons
why
not.
one
is
something
that
justice
scalia
was
raising:
it
may
work
havoc
as
to
what
remains
effective,
what
doesn't,
what
about
the
board
staff
decisions,
which
are,
which
aren't.
i
can
see
a
lot
of
reasons
for
not
doing
it.
but
what
are
your
best
reasons
for
reading
that
vacancy
clause
the
way
you
want
me
to
read
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
would
have
thought,
but
this
is
only
me
--
other
people
don't
necessarily
go
in
for
this
kind
of
argument.
but
in
thinking
of
the
--
the
--
the
arguments
in
your
favor,
the
one
that
sort
of
resonated
a
bit
with
me
was
that
this
is
a
very
republican
congress
in
1947
that
passed
taft-hartley,
and
one
of
the
things
they
were
really
aiming
at
was
to
move
the
board
from
three
to
five.
and
this
is
a
way
so
that
that
just
doesn't
happen.
but
i
assume
from
the
briefs
filed
that
there
is
no
supporting
legislative
history
for
that,
what
i've
just
said,
so
i
better
wipe
it
out
of
my
mind.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
read
--
you
can
read
the
language
the
way
you
want,
that
--
because
of
the
vacancy
clause.
you
see,
there
is
a
sentence
there
that
says
"a
vacancy
shall
not
impair
the
right
of
the
remaining
members
to
exercise
the
power.
"
that
implies
in
the
absence
of
that
clause,
five
to
four,
they
couldn't.
okay?
now,
you
say
that
clause
applies
to
the
remaining
members,
i.e.,
to
the
three.
and
now
we
don't
have
three.
and
since
we
don't
have
three,
there
are
--
and
you
have
to
have
three.
because
they're
not
--
there's
not
--
there
are
not
the
remaining
members,
you
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
long
as
there
was
another
member,
you
could
--
you
could
do
it.
but
without
that
remaining
member,
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
other
legal
--
this
is
what
--
one
thing,
if
i
were
thinking
without
the
language
for
a
moment,
and
i
--
the
taft-hartley
congress
did,
i
think,
want
to
limit
the
powers
in
a
number
of
ways
of
the
board,
maybe
expand
the
membership
to
be
sure
there
would
be
both
parties
in
larger
numbers.
if
you
could
limit
this
to
adjudications,
you
would
say,
well,
then
they
can't
set
major
policy
with
just
two
members.
but
i
don't
see
a
way
to
do
that,
particularly
since
the
board
has
often
set
rules
in
adjudication
which
have
broad
application.
so
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
we
have
to
decide
either,
it
is
okay
for
two
members
to
set
the
most
major
policies,
or
we
have
to
say
they
can't
even
conduct
adjudication,
even
the
simplest
adjudication,
even
the
least
significant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
that
is
a
rule.
they
set
a
rule
in
the
adjudication--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
is
it
--
is
it
correct
numerically
that,
in
fact,
under
identical
language
except
the
word
1935
to
1947,
there
were
two-member
panels
and
they
decided
about
400
cases,
and
then
they
took
the
same
language,
and
now
since
1947,
roughly,
what
are
the
figures?
how
many
cases?
has
it
only
been
this
instance
where
it
has
been
two
members
or
have
there
been
other
instances?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
when
the
400
cases
that
you
are
talking
about
were?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
1947.
and
how
many
cases
were
decided
by
two
members
about,
i'm
not
asking
for
--
during
the
times
you
are
talking
about
before
the
present
two-member
boards?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
need
the
"except
that"
once
you
have
language.
you
need
it
because
now
you
have
a
bigger
board
and
it
says
there
is
a
three-member
quorum.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
they
--
they
simply
are
taking
the
earlier
phrase,
the
earlier
statutory
phrase,
and
they
are
changing
those
words
because
grammatically
you
now
need
it?
