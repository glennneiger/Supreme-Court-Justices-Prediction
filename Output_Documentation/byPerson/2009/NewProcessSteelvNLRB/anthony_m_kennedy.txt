well,
just
on
this
same
point
before
justice
breyer
i
think
moves
to
another
point.
the
statute
does
use
the
word
"quorum"
twice
and,
as
justice
ginsburg
has
pointed
out,
except
that
two
members
--
in
its
last
phrase
it
uses
the
word
"quorum"
twice:
"except
that
two
members
shall
constitute
a
quorum.
"
it
doesn't
say
two
members
may
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
"shall
constitute
a
quorum".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
brings
you
back
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
there's
five
members
on
the
board.
clearly
they
can
delegate
under
the
statute.
now
there
are
only
four
members.
something
happens
to
the
fifth.
under
your
theory,
the
entity
that
originally
delegated
no
longer
exists
and
therefore
the
group,
the
entity
that
received
the
delegation
of
powers,
must
cease,
must
cease
to
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
quorum
of
three
that
authorized
two
to
act
disappears
and
that
means
the
principal
is
no
longer
there,
so
the
agent
can't
exercise
the
authority,
why
isn't
it
the
same
when
five
become
four?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
could
write
the
sentence
without
the
"ed"
unless
you
want
to
say
--
to
make
your
point,
if
the
statute
had
been
written
the
other
way,
to
any
group
continuously
being
designated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
--
suppose
our
first
inquiry
were
agency
law,
and
we
concluded
that
under
agency
law
when
the
principal
ceases
to
exist
the
agent
may
no
longer
function.
let's
assume
we
conclude
that
under
agency
law.
could
you
then
cite
us
a
case
or
a
rationale
for
saying
that
agency
law
should
not
apply
to
a
government
agency,
to
a
problem
of
this
type,
and
if
so,
what
is
your
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
is
like
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine.
it
could
be
that,
if
the
petitioner
prevails
here,
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
would
leave
in
place
everything
that
has
been
done.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
a
different
--
different
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
authority
does
an
alj
purport
and
in
fact
exercise?
he's
not
acting
or
she's
not
acting
for
the
board?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
the
petitioner's
theory,
if
there
is
no
quorum
would
those
appointments
then
be
invalidated,
too?
