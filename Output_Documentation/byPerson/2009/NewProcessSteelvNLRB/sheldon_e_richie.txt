mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
can
continue
to
issue
adjudicatory
decisions
when
its
membership
falls
to
two.
the
national
labor
relations
act
clearly
states
that
at
all
times,
a
quorum
of
the
board
will
be
not
less
than
three
members.
the
board's
interpretation--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--no,
justice
scalia,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
general
counsel,
the
statute
at
153(d)
has
a
separate
enumeration
of
--
of
obligations
and
powers
and
authority,
so
we
don't
think
that
that
fails.
we
also
think
that,
with
respect
to
certain
administrative
type
functions--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--it
has
--
it
does,
justice
scalia.
it
does
have
a
separate
authorization
for
panels
of
three
or
more
members.
it
does
not
have,
as
in
this
case,
a
separate
authorization
for
panels
of
two
members.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
it
is
our
argument
that
the
--
that
once
the
membership
falls
below
three,
that
the
national
labor--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
when
the
membership
of
the
board
falls
below
three.
but
we
also
believe
that
when
the
membership
of
the
group
falls
below
three,
that
the
delegee
group's
authority
to
make
adjudicatory
decisions
lapses.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
you
are
correct,
justice
scalia.
we
are
making
that
argument.
it's
because
of
the
first
sentence
of
153(b),
which
states
that
the
delegations
have
to
be
to
members
of
three
or
more
members.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
well,
we
believe
they
can
function.
they
can
receive,
for
example,
unfair
labor
practices
complaints.
they
can't
make
adjudicatory
decisions.
and
we
think
that
that
is
exactly
what--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--we
believe
they
can,
because
there
is
probably
a
different
statute
that
enumerates
that,
justice
scalia,
other
than
this
statute
with
respect
to
the
authority
with
respect
to
adjudicatory
decisions.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
well,
one
of
the
--
justice
scalia,
one
of
the
things
that
we
think
is
clear
is
that
the
remedy
for
fixing
an
undersized
board
is
not
for
the
board
to
redefine
itself
and
to
read
the
statute,
but
for
congress
or
the
president
to
act.
and
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
president
and
congress
could
--
could
fix
the
problem
of
an
undersized
board.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
well,
i
think
there
is
two
answers
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
one
is
here
the
government
--
the
board
takes
the
position,
as
they
say
on
page
29
in
a
footnote
to
their
brief,
that
when
a
delegate
group
possessed
of
all
of
the
board's
power
acts,
it
is
acting
as
the
board
and
not
as
an
agent
of
the
board.
so
first,
we
would
say
that
the
second
quorum
provision
isn't
even
applicable
to
this
group
that
was
established
--
of
members
kirsanow,
liebman
and
schaumber.
and
so
we
think
the
three-member
quorum--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--certainly,
justice
scalia.
the
government
--
i'm
sorry,
"the
government".
the
nlrb
in
its
brief
in
footnote
21
on
page
29,
as
well
as
in
the
delegation,
the
minutes
of
the
delegation
in
2007,
which
are
found
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
on
--
i
think
it's
pages
4a
and
5a.
both
say
that
when
--
the
nlrb
says
in
the
footnote
"when
the
delegee
group
possessed
of
all
of
the
board's
powers.
"
which
is
what
we
have
here,
"acts,
it
is
acting
as
the
board
and
not
as
an
agent
of
the
board.
"
"so
our
position
is
that
when
you
become
the
board,
as
this
group
did,
now
you
are
subject
to
that
minimum
three-member
delegee
--
three
member
quorum
requirement.
"
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
it's
a
--
it's
a
group
that
is
delegated
authority,
and
therefore,
whether
it's
a
full
delegation
or
partial
delegation,
we
believe
that
the
common
law
principles
of
agency
and
principal
make
that
delegee
group
an
agent.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
justice
ginsburg,
it
does
not
say
the
word
"agent"
in
it.
but
the
delegation
that
it's
referring
to
is
at
common
law
a
principal-agency
relationship.
so
it's
our
position
that
once
that
delegation
occurs
that
the
--
in
a
normal
situation,
because
you
could
have
a
three-member
group
of
four
members,
a
board
of
four
or
a
board
of
five,
and
you
could
have
a
group
with
three
members.
when
the
delegation
is
made,
it's
our
position
and
we
believe
that
this
is
the
position
that
the
d.c.
circuit
took
as
well,
that
that's
an
agent
of
the
board.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
it
did
say
that.
but
it
also
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
applying
the
rules,
the
common
law
rules
of
principal
and
agency,
and
that
when
the
board
without
three
members
lost
its
authority
to
act,
that
the
delegee
group
to
which
the
delegation
was
made
also
lost
authority
to
act.
and
in
this
case
that's
exactly
what
happened.
we
had
a
three-member
board
--
we
actually
had
four
delegate
to
three,
and
then
two
terms
expired.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
justice
kennedy--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
we
have
to
start
first
--
and
you
are
correct,
there
are
two
quorum
provisions,
but
"quorum"
is
not
defined
differently.
quorum
--
i
think
we
agree
within
nlrb
that
a
quorum
is
the
minimum
number
of
members
of
a
body
necessary
to
transact
business.
we
have
two
different
bodies
defined
in
this
statute.
we
have
the
board
as
one
body
and
we
have
the
group
as
a
different
body.
and
so
when
the
--
when
the
exception
appears
in
the
statute,
we
agree
again
with
the
d.c.
circuit's
interpretation
of
that
as
simply
defining
two
different
numbers
of
people
necessary
to
fill
out
a
quorum
of
these
two
different
bodies
that
are
defined
within
the
statute.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
clearly.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
justice
breyer,
the
difference
is
that
in
this
statute
there
is
a
clear
statement
that
at
all
times
the
board
must
have
a
three-member
quorum.
in
your
hypothetical
there
were
still
four
members.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
the
board
was
still
in
place.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
well,
the
difference
is
that
once
the
--
the
difference
between
the
hypothetical
and
the
situation
we
are
in
is
that
there
were
four
members,
and
the
statute--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--it
makes
a
difference
because
the
statute
requires
that
at
all
times
the
board
shall
have
a
quorum
of
three
members,
a
minimum
quorum
of
three
members.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
well,
i
think
the
problem
is,
justice
sotomayor,
that
the
delegation
to
a
group
of
three
is
indeed
a
valid
delegation.
we
don't
contest
that.
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
phantom
group.
and
what
the
--
what
the
board
said,
because
member
kirsanow's
term
expired
in
december,
about
11
days
after
the
delegation.
and
if
you
look
at
the
minutes
of
the
board
when
they
are
delegating
to
the
group,
it
says
in
the
minutes
that
they
"are
continuing
to
be
a
two-member
quorum
of
a
three-member
group.
"
as
if
member
kirsanow
is
a
phantom.
it's
a
fiction.
the
group
ceases
to
exist
and
the
board
--
it's
not
just
that
the
board
falls
below
three
and
the
board
ceases
to
exist
with
all
delegated
powers
to
this
group.
the
group
ceases
to
exist.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
justice
kennedy,
i--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--well,
we
believe
that
the
reason
that
it
isn't,
justice
kennedy,
the
same
is
--
terrible
sentence.
it's
not
the
same
because
the
statute
contemplates
vacancies
on
the
board
and
multiple
vacancies,
so
long
as
they
don't
go
below
three.
the
statute
--
the
vacancy
clause
in
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
a
group
at
all.
so
the
delegating
group
in
the
hypothetical
clearly
is
still
in
place
as
the
board
because
it's
the
board
that
delegated.
and
the
board
still
exists.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
justice
alito,
the
difference
is
that
here
there
was
never
a
way
to
reconstitute
this
board
--
i'm
sorry,
the
group
--
as
three
members.
when
you
have
five
or
you
have
four
members
of
the
board
and
a
member
of
a
three-member
group
is
unable
to
perform
his
or
her
function--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--well,
i
believe
that
the
board
could
revise
the
decision
of
one
of
its
panels.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
the
adjudication
is
final.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
of
the
three-member
group.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that
is
correct.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that's
true.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
justice
breyer,
we
--
we
believe
that
it
is
important
to
have
a
promote
--
to
have
a
robust
debate
and
an
expression
of
--
a
potential
for
expression
of
dissent.
and
what
you
have
here
is
you
have
two
members
in
a
group
and
--
who
have
publicly
announced
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
over
the
last
2
years
plus
3
months
when
this
board
has
sat
with
only
2
members,
that
they
have
sometimes
compromised
their
opinions
in
the
interest
of
the
institutional
purposes,
basically
to
keep
the
doors
open.
and
so
you
don't
have
a
full
and
robust
debate.
you
don't
have
the
potential
for
an
expression
of
a
dissenting
view,
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
distinction
that
we
see.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
justice
sotomayor,
if
we
consented
that
when
there
was
an
absence,
a
member
who
dies,
retires,
is
incapacitated,
that
the
two
members
of
a
properly
constituted
three
--
three-member
group
could
still
function,
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
say
that.
we
do
not
consent
to
that
or
agree
with
that
proposition.
what
--
what
somebody--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--yes.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
the
definition
of
a
quorum,
justice
sotomayor,
is
the
minimum
number
of
persons
of
a
body
necessary
to
transact
business.
the
body
here
is
defined
as
three
or
more
people.
so,
when
the--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--i
am,
too.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
in
the
statute,
the
group
is
defined
as
--
the
board
is
authorized,
and
i'm
reading
from
153(b),
appendix
1a
to
our
brief:
"the
board
is
authorized
to
delegate
to
any
group
of
three
or
more
members--
"
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--"any
or
all"
--
that
is
where
we
find
it
necessary
that
the
group
must
contain
at
least
three
members.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
it
is,
and
we
think
it's
an
additional
argument.
we
think
there's
multiple--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
but
what's
happened
routinely
for
--
for
60
years
since
1947
when
taft-hartley
was
passed,
is
that
what
the
board
did
was
it
reconstituted
the
panels
any
time
a
member
died
or
retired.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
this
is
the
first
time,
yes.
for
over
--
from
1947
through
19
--
up
to
2007,
any
time
the
board
fell
to
two
members
--
as
far
as
we
know,
any
time
the
board
fell
to
two
members,
the
board
reconstituted
--
i'm
sorry.
any
time
a
group
fell
to
two
members,
the
board
reconstituted
the
group
to
a
three-member
group.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
well,
justice
alito,
i
think
it's
a
different
statute.
but
we
also
--
i
also
think
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
the
delegating
body
that
forms
the
--
the
three-member
courts,
still
is
in
existence.
and
if
we
just--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--well,
justice
scalia,
it's
a
different
statute
but
it's
also
a
very
temporary
and
limited
circumstance.
you
have
a
panel
that
was
formed
to
hear
a
case.
here
you
have
got
a
delegation
of
all
the
authority,
the
board
has
--
the
group
has
become
the
board,
and
we
effectively
have
a
two-member
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
justice
breyer,
the
legislative
history
i
think
is
--
there
is
no
legislative
history
on
what
happens
when
the
board
falls
below
two
members.
but
it
is
clear
that
from
1935
to
1947,
the
board
was
made
up
of
three
members,
and
the
statute
clearly
said
under
the
wagner
act
two
members
could
be
a
quorum
of
a
three-member
board.
in
1947
when
taft-hartley
was
passed,
congress
intentionally
increased
the
quorum
and
increased
the
size
of
the
board.
if
it
had
intended
to
have
only
two
members
serve
at
any
time
as
a
two-member
board,
they
would
not
--
that
would
be
a
strange
way
to
do
it,
in
a
statute
that
not
only
increases
the
size
of
the
board,
but
changes
the
minimum
quorum
requirement
from
two
to
three.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that
is
correct,
but
that's
to
hear
it
as
opposed
to
overturn
it
once
the
decision
is
made.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
--
the
--
the
five-member
board
would
not
review
the
three-member
group's
decision.
but
in
response
to
justice--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--what
was--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--multiple--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
multiple
members
of
three.
and
so
before
you
had
a
--
a
--
without
a
delegation,
you
had
a
group
of
three
members.
they
could
--
that
group
could
hear
--
or
board--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--it's
a
draft--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--yes,
justice
alito,
it
does.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that's
not--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
can
agree
to
--
to
review
the
decision
and
they
can
agree
before
the
decision
is
made
to
join
the
panel,
basically
is
what
they
do.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
one
member
wants
to
join
the
panel?
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that
member
would
review
the
group's
decision.
he
wouldn't
be
able
--
he
or
she
wouldn't
be
able
to
overturn
the
group's
decision.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
the
decision
is
final
once
it
is
rendered.
they
can
review
the
decision
in
draft
form
before
it
is--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--they
can
do
that
or
they
can
ask
to
be
included
on
the
--
on
the
panel.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
but
they
can't
overturn
it.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
i
believe
it's
the
same,
justice
ginsburg,
that
it's
exactly
the
same.
but
--
but
you
have
an
additional
opportunity--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that's
correct,
justice
alito.
it
does.
and
it
--
and
therefore
you
have
what
we
don't
have
here,
is
an
opportunity
for
a
robust
debate.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
first,
let
me
address
the
--
the
issue
of
what
happens
if
we
prevail,
how
will
the
problem
be
fixed.
there
are
two
types
of
cases.
there
are
representation
cases,
and
then
there
are
cases
dealing
with
unfair
labor
practices.
the
unfair
labor
practices,
mr.
chief
justice,
have
a
limitations
period
to
them.
the
--
the
issues
--
the
issues
with
respect
to
representation
have
no
limitations.
so
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
comment
--
i
believe
it
was
justice
ginsburg
--
there's
a
--
when
a
successor
comes
on
board,
these
issues,
if
these
--
if
we
prevail
and
our
decision
is
vacated,
those
are
--
can
be
reheard
by
the
board
when
a
successor
is
in
place.
the
d.c.
circuit--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--that's
correct.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
well,
except
to
the
extent,
justice
scalia,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
has
not
run
on
those
unfair
labor--
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
--cases.
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
that's
an
argument.
that's
a
different
case.
i
don't
know
the
answer.
and
i'm
sure
the
litigants
would
argue
that.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
--
whether
it's
three
members
that
are
required
on
both
the
board
and
the
group,
the
d.c.
circuit
didn't
deal
with
that,
but
they
did
deal
with
the
exception
issue.
and
they
said
--
i'm
reading
from
the
appendix
page
89
of
our
petition:
the
board
forum
requirement
therefore
must
be
satisfied
regardless
of
whether
the
board's
authority
is
delegated
to
a
group
of
its
members.
a
modifying
phrase
such
as
--
as
this,
talking
about
the
"at
all
times
three
members"
denotes
that
there
is
no
instance
in
which
the
board
forum
requirement
may
be
disregarded.
and
then
the
court
said:
"it
therefore
defies
logic
as
well
as
the
text
of
the
statute
to
argue
as
the
board
does
that
a
congress
which
explicitly
imposed
a
requirement
for
a
three-member
quorum
at
all
times
would
in
the
same
sentence
allow
the
board
to
reduce
its
operative
quorum
to
two
without
further
congressional
authorization.
"
mr.
sheldon
e.
richie
and,
justice
ginsburg,
that
was
what
the
d.c.
circuit
was
referring
to
was
the
"except
that"
language,
and
saying
in
that
same
sentence,
where
there
is
a
requirement
at
all
times
of
a
three-member
quorum
of
the
board,
that
it
is
--
it
defies
logic
that
congress
would
in
that
same
sentence
state
except
when
there
is
three
that
falls
to
two.
and
i
think
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
conclude
is
that
the
--
my
time's
up.
thank
you.
