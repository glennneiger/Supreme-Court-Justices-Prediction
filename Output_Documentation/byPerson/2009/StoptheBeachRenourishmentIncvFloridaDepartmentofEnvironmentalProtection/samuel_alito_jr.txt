justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--why
isn't
it
a
fundamental
change
in
florida
property
law
to
extend
these
concepts
of
accretion
and
avulsion
to
things
that
are
done
by
the
state?
if
someone
owns
beachfront
property,
they
accept
--
they
--
they
understand
the
risk
that
a
hurricane
may
cause
avulsion,
a
hurricane
may
knock
down
their
house.
does
that
mean
the
state
could
come
in
and
knock
down
the
house
and
say
this
is
an
artificial
avulsion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what's
the
difference?
you're
taking
a
concept
that
has
to
do
with
a
risk
that
you
bear
because
of
the
--
the
vagaries
of
--
of
the
weather
and
storms,
and
you're
applying
it
to
something
that's
done
by
the
state.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
talking
about
a
label,
and
putting
the
avulsion
label
and
the
accretion
label
on
something
that
the
state
does,
doesn't
--
doesn't
eliminate
the
fact
that
there's
been
a
fundamental
change.
you
have
taken
a
doctrine
that
applies
to
things
that
occur
as
a
result
of
nature
and
you've
applied
it
to
things
that
are
produced
by
the
state.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
that
--
suppose
that
a
city
decided
that
it
wanted
to
attract
more
students
who
are
going
to
the
beach
in
florida
for
spring
break,
and
so
therefore
it
decided
it
was
going
to
create
a
huge
beach
in
front
of
--
of
privately
owned
homes.
under
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
i
don't
see
anything
that
would
stop
the
city
from
doing
that.
so
you
could
have
--
you
could
have
televised
spring
break
beach
parties
in
front
of
--
of
somebody's
house.
now,
in
--
as
a
practical
matter,
doesn't
that
have
a
real
effect
on
the
value
of
the
property?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
understand
that,
but
if
the
--
but
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
there
isn't
any
right
--
if
there
is
a
manmade
extension
of
the
beach,
there
is
no
right
to
exclude
people
from
it;
it's
--
the
beach
is
owned
by
the
state.
so
all
of
that
could
take
place,
couldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
just
ask
you
this,
mr.
kneedler,
before
your
time
expires,
what
--
i
agree,
martin
v.
busch
seems
to
be
the
case
that's
most
--
provides
the
greatest
support
for
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
here.
but
what
do
we
do
about
the
fact
that
the
florida
supreme
court
didn't
rely
on
it?
