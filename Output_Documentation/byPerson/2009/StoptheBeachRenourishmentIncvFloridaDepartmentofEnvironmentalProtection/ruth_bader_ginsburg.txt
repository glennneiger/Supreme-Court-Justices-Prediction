justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
basic
position
in
the
litigation
in
florida
was
that
the
florida
legislation
violated
the
takings
protection,
and
so
it's
kind
of
strange
to
switch
your
target
from
the
legislature,
which
enacted
this
measure,
and
then
say,
because
the
judiciary
upheld
it,
the
judiciary
somehow
is
complicit
in
this
violation
by
the
legislature
implemented
by
the
administrative
offices.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
applied
in
a
new
situation.
it
was
never
the
kind
of
situation
involved
here
with
the
beach
restoration
project.
the
--
the
precedent
did
not
involve
the
kind
of
situation
that
this
case
presents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
--
can
you
explain
something
that's
unclear
to
me
from
the
briefs
and
the
records?
that
is,
there
--
this
--
what
is
referred
to
as
"the
foreshore",
was
that
wet
all
the
time?
i
thought
the
suggestion
was
that
that
was
in
effect
beach,
public
beach,
that
people
could
walk
on,
not
swim
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
--
and
the
public
--
what
--
what
was
the
situation
here?
was
there
a
strip
of
dry
land
that
the
public
has
been
using?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
owns
that
land?
i
mean,
when
it
was
submerged
it
belonged
to
the
state.
and
is
it
your
position
that
the
owners
in
your
organization,
that
they
have
title
to
that
land
that
was
once
owned
by
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
mean
--
i
mean,
without
condemning
it,
you
say
the
title
is
held
by
the
private
owners
even
though
the
title
was
held
by
the
state
when
the
land
was
submerged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
happened?
there
were
a
succession
of
hurricanes,
i
thought.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
the
answer
to
the
question
that
was
asked
of
your
colleague?
that
is,
here
we
have
an
organization
representing
several
landowners.
is
there
any
indication
about
how
these
beachfront
owners
in
these
communities
--
what
their
view
is,
that
they
are
benefited,
that
they
are
harmed?
is
there
any
indication
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
statute
provides--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
very
statute
says
if
--
if
what
happens
is
a
taking,
then
there's
compensation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
did
they
drop
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
why
isn't
it
--
it
is
equally
an
addition
to
the
private
property
owners'
rights
when
they
had
a
narrow
beach
and
now
they're
claiming
that
--
that
it's
all
theirs,
the
full
75
feet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
have,
under
your
theory,
much
more
property
than
they
had
before.
they
have
a
wider
beach
that's
theirs,
so
they
have
gained
property,
but
that
doesn't
count?
