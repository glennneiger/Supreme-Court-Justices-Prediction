we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
08-1151,
stop
the
beach
renourishment
v.
the
florida
department
of
environmental
protection.
mr.
safriet.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
somebody
wanted
to
put
up
a
hot
dog
stand
on
this
new
land,
would
you
have
the
right
to
tell
them
they
can't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
do
you
have
any--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--do
you
have
any
reason
to
suppose
that
that's
a
redefinition
of
--
of
property
that
the
legislature
isn't
free
to
change
tomorrow?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be
--
what
would
your
position
be,
assuming
you
still
have
title,
you
still
have
the
right
of
littoral
title,
contact
with
the
water?
would
you
concede
that
the
state
has
different
regulatory
interests
with
respect
to
that
new
strip
of
land
versus
the
old
strip
of
land?
it's
still
your
property.
the
state
can
regulate
your
property.
presumably,
they
regulate
your
beach
property
now.
would
their
different
--
would
their
authority
to
regulate
be
greater
with
respect
to
the
new
area?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
your
--
you
would
still
have
the
title
to
the
property.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
still
your
property.
you
know,
the
state
regulates
property
all
the
time,
in
zoning
--
would
their
authority
be
broader
with
respect
to
that
new
land
than
with
respect
to
the
old?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sometimes
--
and
i
don't
actually
know
what
the
law
is
on
this.
sometimes
the
state
builds,
you
know,
sidewalks
in
front
of
people.
maybe
they
do
it
on
their
own
land,
and
they
say:
we're
putting
this
easement,
and
people
can
walk
across
it.
would
this
be
in
the
same
category
of
public
project?
they
say,
well,
it's
your
land
because
you
have
a
right
to
the
mean
high-water
land,
but
we
built
it
so
we
have
greater
rights
with
respect
to
regulation
than
we
might
have
with
respect
to
the
natural
beach.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
the
state--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--could
the
state
sell
this
new
land
to
somebody
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
safriet.
mr.
makar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
it
depends
on
--
or
maybe
not
--
how
quickly
it
all
happens.
i
mean,
if
the
state
project
is
such
that
they
add
a
foot
a
year,
is
that
an
avulsion
or
accretion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
your
view
whenever
the
state
does
it,
it's
an
avulsion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
know.
my
--
my
questions
was
what
if
it
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
recall
how
quickly
things
happened
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
it's
--
if
it's
gradual,
even
though
the
state
is
doing
it,
it
can
be
an
accretion,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
foot
a
year.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
on
these
facts--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--on
these
facts,
if
the
state's
project
added
sand
at
a
foot
a
year,
the
landowner
would
win?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
foot
--
are
we
dickering
over
the
distance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then,
wherever
you
want
to
say
it's
an
accretion
--
what
--
it's
an
inch,
6
inches--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so,
you're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
i
can
--
we're
arguing
about
the
application
of
a
doctrine
to
this
case.
i'd
like
to
step
back
if
i
can
and
talk
about
the
doctrine
through
a
hypothetical,
if
that's
all
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
--
the
--
let's
say
the
legislature
passes
an
act
saying
the
boundary
of
beachfront
property
is
now
where
the
sand
starts,
and
not
the
mean
high-water
mark
but
the
mean
high-sand
mark.
all
right?
and
--
and
then
--
so
that's
sued.
you
--
you
sue
under
that,
and
the
court
says:
yes,
of
course,
that's
a
taking;
our
precedents
have
always
said
it's
the
mean
high-water
line
and
nothing
else.
florida
has
judicial
elections.
say,
somebody
runs
for
election
for
the
florida
supreme
court
and
says:
i'm
going
to
change
that
law.
i'm
going
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
taking.
i
think
people
should
be
able
to
walk
right
up
to
the
land.
and
that
person
is
elected,
and
the
law
is
changed.
now,
is
--
is
that
a
judicial
taking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
a
possibility
or
is
it
a
clear
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
know.
you're
changing--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
understand
you
have
a
different
view
about
here.
but
under
my
hypothetical,
would
you
agree
that
the
action
of
the
florida
supreme
court
is
a
taking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
question.
i
mean,
you
just
said
that,
let's
assume
the
--
assuming
the
property
line
doesn't
change.
the
other
side
is
saying
the
property
line
is
the
mean
high-water
line,
and
so
if
you
--
whoever
adds
sand,
the
state,
mother
nature,
you
dumping
it
--
i
guess
you
can't
do
that,
but
whoever
adds
it,
the
property
line
is
the
mean
high-water
line--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
but
that's
because
you
think
the
property
line
is
the
ecl
rather
than
the
mhwl.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
same
as
the
property
right
he
held
before,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he
can
exclude
people
from
the
additional
60
feet?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
that's
what
the
case
is
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
doesn't
--
why
don't
you
take
your
list
and
justice
breyer's
list
and
submit
that
in
the
just
compensation
hearing?
when
the
landowner
comes
in
and
says,
look,
you
have
taken
my
property
and
it
is
worth
$100,000,
and
you
come
in
and
say
oh,
no,
no;
it's
not
worth
$100,000;
look
at
all
these
things
we
saved
and
gave
you.
it's
only
--
what
you
have
lost
is
only
worth
$20,000.
and
a
court
will
review
that
and
say
yes,
no,
whatever,
and
that's
what
you
get.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
again,
that
is
what
the
whole
case
is
about,
whether
they
have
a
right
to
contact
the
water
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
if
your
only
answer
to
every
question
is
they
don't
have
the
right,
you're
just
completely
begging
the
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
on
behalf
of
the
state,
you
concede
if
any
of
this
list
--
these
--
the
list
of
good
things
that
the
land
owner
gets,
if
the
legislature
next
year
takes
them
away,
that
would
be
a
taking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
complete
your
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
that's
a
clever
ploy.
we're
talking
about
judicial
takings
and
you
say,
don't
look
at
what
the
court
did;
look
at
what
the
legislature
did.
that
changes
the
whole
ball
game.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
choice.
if
their
argument
is
what
the
court
did
constituted
the
taking,
they
couldn't
have
raised
that
earlier--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
said,
oh,
we
think
we
know
that
the
court
is
going
to
change
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
judicial
--
judicial
taking
if
that
were
the
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
accretion
--
accretion,
of
course,
would
change.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
take
submerged
state
land
and
give
it
to
the
landowner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
a
foot
--
i'll
get
back
to
what
i
raised
earlier.
a
foot
a
year,
if
the
state
does
it
and
it's
a
foot
a
year,
does
the
property
owner
get
the
foot,
or
does
the
state
get
the
foot?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
makes
a
difference
whether
it's
done
in
a
day
or
done
in
a
month?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
is
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
what
--
what
is
your
view
on
the
hypothetical
i
posed
to
your
--
to
your
friend?
the
legislature
moves
it
to
the
vegetation
line.
the
state
supreme
court
says
that's
a
taking.
somebody
runs
for
election
to
the
state
supreme
court,
saying,
i'm
going
to
change
that.
he's
elected.
he
changes
the
law.
is
that
a
judicial
taking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
--
it's
not
pretextual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
says,
i
think
they
got
the
law
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
adding
an
amusement
park,
though,
under
your
theory,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
the
state's
property.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
the
state's
property.
they
can.
if
they
want
to
put
an
amusement
park
on,
they
can--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--let's
see
if
there
are
any
further
questions.
(no
response.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
safriet,
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
081151,
stop
the
beach
renourishment
inc.
versus
the
florida
department
of
environmental
protection.
he
has
asked
that
i
announce
the
opinion
for
him.
in
this
case,
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
we
deal
with
complicated
facts
and
the
summary
that
follows
leaves
out
some
minor
details.
under
florida
law,
the
state
owns
in
trust
for
the
public
land
permanently
submerged
beneath
navigable
waters
and
the
land
between
the
low-tide
line
and
the
mean
high-water
line.
thus
the
mean
high-water
line
is
the
ordinary
boundary
between
private
beachfront
or
littoral
property
and
state-owned
land.
littoral
owners
have
certain
rights
that
include
as
relevant
here,
the
right
to
ownership
of
the
accretions
to
their
littoral
property.
an
accretion
is
in
addition
to
shore
property
that
occurs
gradually
and
imperceptibly.
an
addition
created
by
a
sudden
change
such
as
a
hurricane
is
called
an
avulsion
and
does
not
belong
to
the
littoral
owner,
when
an
avulsion
occurs
the
seaward
boundary
of
littoral
property
remains
what
it
was,
the
mean
high-water
line
before
the
event.
thus,
when
an
avulsion
has
added
new
land,
the
littoral
owner
no
longer
owns
oceanfront
and
any
later
accretions
to
the
new
land
belong
to
the
owner
of
the
seabed
which
is
ordinarily
the
state.
florida's
beach
and
shore
preservation
act
establishes
procedures
for
restoration
projects,
that
consists
of
depositing
sand
on
eroded
beaches.
when
such
a
project
is
undertaken,
the
respondent,
board
of
trustees
of
the
internal
improvement
trust
fund
which
holds
title
to
the
seabed
sets
a
fixed
“erosion
control
line”
to
replace
the
fluctuating
mean
high-water
line
as
the
boundary
between
littoral
property
and
state
property.
once
the
new
line
is
recorded,
the
common
law
ceases
to
apply.
thereafter,
when
accretion
moves
the
mean
high-water
line
seaward,
the
littoral
property
remains
bounded
by
the
permanent
erosion-control
line
and
is
thus
no
longer
oceanfront
property.respondents,
the
city
of
destin
and
walton
county
sought
permits
to
restore
6.9
miles
of
beach
eroded
by
several
hurricanes,
adding
about
75
feet
of
dry
sand
seaward
of
the
mean
high-water
line
which
was
to
become
fixed
as
the
erosion-control
line.
petitioner,
a
nonprofit
corporation
formed
by
owners
of
oceanfront
property
bordering
a
project,
brought
an
unsuccessful
administrative
challenge.
respondent,
the
florida
department
of
environmental
protection
approved
the
permits,
and
this
suit
followed.
the
district
court
of
appeal
for
the
first
district
concluded
that
the
department's
order
had
eliminated
the
petitioner
member's
right
to
receive
accretions
to
their
property,
thus
affecting
an
uncompensated,
an
unconstitutional
taking.
the
court
of
appeal,
therefore
set
aside
the
order,
remanded
the
proceeding
and
certified
to
the
florida
supreme
court
the
question
whether
the
act
unconstitutionally
deprived
petitioner's
members
of
littoral
rights
without
just
compensation.
the
state
supreme
court
answered
“no”
and
quashed
the
remand,
concluding
that
the
members
did
not
own
the
property
supposedly
taken.
petitioner
sought
rehearing
on
the
ground
that
the
florida
supreme
court's
decision
affected
a
taking
of
petitioner's
member's
littoral
rights
contrary
to
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
rehearing
was
denied
and
we
granted
certiorari.
i
will
describe,
first
the
holding
of
a
plurality
of
the
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
scalia
joined
by
me,
justice
thomas
and
justice
alito.
well,
the
classic
thinking
is
a
transfer
of
property
to
the
state
or
to
another
private
party
by
eminent
domain,
the
takings
clause
applies
to
other
state
actions
that
achieve
the
same
thing.
thus
we
upheld
that
it
is
a
taking,
if
the
government
recharacterize
as
public
property
what
was
previously
private
property.
the
takings
clause
is
not
addressed
to
the
action
of
a
specific
branch
or
branches,
it
is
concerned
simply
with
the
act,
and
not
the
governmental
actor,
nor
shall
private
property
be
taken
is
what
it
says.
there
is
no
textual
justification,
for
saying
that
the
existence
or
the
scope
of
a
state's
power
to
expropriate
private
property
without
just
compensation,
varies
according
to
the
branch
of
government
affecting
the
expropriation.
nor
does
common
sense
recommends
such
a
principle,
it
would
be
absurd
to
allow
a
state
to
do
by
judicial
decree
what
the
takings
clause
forbids
it
to
do
by
legislative
fiat
and
our
precedents
provide
no
support
for
such
a
thing.
in
some,
if
a
legislature
or
a
court
declares
that
what
was
once
an
established
right
to
private
property,
no
longer
exist.
it
has
taken
that
property,
no
less
than
if
the
state
had
physically
appropriated
it
or
destroyed
its
value
by
regulation.
the
plurality
opinion
then
rejects
several
arguments
of
respondents
opposing
the
principle
that
there
can
be
a
judicial
taking
or
adding
to
it,
conditions
that
would
not
apply
to
a
legislative
or
executive
taking.
one
is
that
the
federal
courts
lacked
the
knowledge
of
state
law,
required
to
decide
whether
a
judicial
decision
that
purports
merely
to
clarify
property
rights
has
instead
taken
an
established
property
right.
but
in
non-takings
context,
federal
courts
must
often
decide
what
state
property
rights
exist
and
indeed
they
must
do
so
to
resolve
claims
that
legislative
or
executive
action
has
affected
a
taking.
another
argument
is
that
we
must
not
deprive
common-law
judging
of
needed
flexibility
but
that
argument
has
little
appeal
when
directed
against
the
enforcement
of
a
constitutional
guarantee,
adopted
in
an
era
when
courts
had
no
power
to
change
the
common-law
and
there's
no
apparent
reason,
why
judges
need
more
flexibility
to
change
the
legislatures
or
executives.
now
as
described,
the
test
we
apply
for
a
judicial
taking
is
whether
the
decision
eliminates
an
established
property
right.
the
petitioner
proposes
instead
an
“unpredictability
test”
maintaining
that
a
judicial
taking
consists
of
a
decision
that
“constitutes
a
sudden
change
in
state
law,
unpredictable
in
terms
of
relevant
precedents”.
we
reject
that,
what
counts
is
not
whether
there
is
precedent
or
warning
for
the
allegedly
confiscatory
decision,
warning
or
not,
what
matters
is
whether
the
property
right
allegedly
taken
was
established.
the
portions
of
the
opinion
i
next
describe
are
unanimous,
they
pertain
to
whether
a
taking
has
occurred
and
are
joined
by
the
four
justices,
who
find
no
need
to
decide
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
judicial
taking.
at
the
outset,
the
city
and
county
argue
that
petitioner
cannot
state
a
cause
of
action
for
a
taking
because
though
petitioner's
members
own
private
property,
petitioner
itself
does
not
and
that
the
claim
is
un-right
because
petitioner
has
not
sought
just
compensation,
neither
objection
appeared
in
the
briefs
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
since
neither
is
jurisdictionally
deemed,
both
waived.
petitioner
argues
that
the
florida
supreme
court
took
its
members,
right
to
accretion
by
simply
declaring
that
the
right
did
not
exist.
we
conclude
however,
that
there
was
no
pre-existing
established
right
to
accretion
under
the
circumstances
produced
by
florida's
beach
and
shore
preservation
act,
the
new
land
added
to
the
shore
would
not
come
by
way
of
accretion,
that
is
gradually
but
by
way
of
avulsion,
a
sudden
addition
by
dumping
along
the
shore,
sand
dredged
from
farther
out.
prior
florida
cases
suggest
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
fill
in
submerged
land
and
then
an
avulsion
created
by
the
state
is
no
different
from
any
other
avulsion.
it
cannot
be
said
therefore
that
the
florida
supreme
court's
decision
deprived
petitioner's
members
of
an
established
property
right,
since
they
had
no
established
right
to
additions
by
avulsion.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
affirmed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justice
sotomayor
has
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
the
case.
