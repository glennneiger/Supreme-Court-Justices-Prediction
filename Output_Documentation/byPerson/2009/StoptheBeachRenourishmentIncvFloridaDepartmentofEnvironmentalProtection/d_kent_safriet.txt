mr.
d.
kent
safriet
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
we
ask
this
court
to
expressly
recognize
that
a
state
court
decision,
unpredictable
in
terms
of
relevant
precedents,
which
redefines
century-old
property
rights
to
no
longer
exist,
violates
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
florida
supreme
court
suddenly
and
dramatically
redefined
littoral
property
rights,
converting
oceanfront
property
into
oceanview
property
to
avoid
the
finding
of
a
taking.
it
did
so
in
the
context
of
a
beach
restoration
project
which
could
have
been
accomplished
without
taking
any
private
property
at
all.
given
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
a
state's
legislative
and
executive
branches
cannot
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
we
see
no
reason
why
the
judicial
branch
should
be
treated
any
differently.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
below,
the
case
was
litigated
as
one
of
a
taking
by
the
legislature
when
it
passed
the
act.
when
it
passed
the
beach
and
shore
preservation
act,
it
contained
a
provision
within
section
161.141,
which
is
a
savings
clause,
that
said
to
the
extent
the
beach
restoration
cannot
be
accomplished
without
taking
property
rights,
the
requesting
authorities
have
to
use
eminent
domain
proceedings
to
take
those
rights.
at
the
first
district
court
of
appeal,
they
agreed
with
us
that
the
littoral
rights
were
being
taken
by
the
act
of
the
legislature
and
that
those
had
to
be
compensated
for.
when
we
arrived
at
the
florida
supreme
court,
again,
all
of
the
parties
were
arguing
those
issues,
whether
there
was
a
physical
taking
of
these
rights
or
a
regulatory
taking
of
these
rights
by
the
act
and
whether
the
savings
clause
would
apply.
to
everybody's
shock,
the
florida
supreme
court
said:
we're
going
to
go
back
to
step
one
and
decide
you
don't
have
any
littoral
rights.
the
legislature
didn't
eliminate
any
protected
littoral
rights
that
you
thought
you
once
had
for
over
a
hundred
years
as
the
relevant
precedents
in
common
law
indicate.
so
it
was
that
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
that
said
you
have
--
no
longer
have
property,
that
gives
rise
to
the
issue
before
this
court
is,
can
the
florida
supreme
court
redefine
those
100-year-old
rights
to
no
longer
exist?
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
precedent
with
respect
to
the
beach
and
shore
preservation
act
as
it
has
ever
been
applied.
we
do
concede
that.
however,
there
are
two
fundamental
principles
of
florida
law
that
have
existed
for
more
than
a
hundred
years,
and
those
are
property
that
must
--
property
that
borders
the
mean
high-water
line
and
must
remain
in
contact
with
the
mean
high-water
line
to
possess
common
law
littoral
rights.
if
that
connection
is
not
there,
there
are
no
common
law
littoral
rights.
common
law
littoral
rights
are
constitutionally
protected
and
cannot
be
taken
without
due
process
and
just
compensation.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
under
the--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--well,
because
the
avulsion
in
this
case,
your
honor,
was
the
hurricanes
that
the
state
cites
as
the
reason
for
the
beaches
being
washed
away,
and
--
and
it
was--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--that
is
right,
your
honor,
but
the
--
there
is
no
case
law
in
florida
or
no
principle
that
says
avulsion
can
occur
by
artificial
means.
so
there
is
--
the
beach
restoration,
where
they
placed
sand
on
the
beach,
is
not
avulsion.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
no,
the
case
law
specifically
says
that
avulsion
is
a
result
of
natural
occurrences,
by
the
action
of
the
wind
and
the
water.
that's
what
avulsion
is
in
florida
and
has
been
--
you
know,
for
at
least
50
years,
i
believe.
it's--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--the
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
the
doctrine
of
avulsion
--
as
part
of
the
doctrine
of
avulsion
is
the
doctrine
--
or
the
right
to
reclaim
what
was
lost
by
the
landowner.
so
when
an
avulsion
event
occurs,
the
landowner
that
has
lost
property
has
a
right
under
common
law
to
reclaim
what
they
lost.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
what
--
what
was
lost
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
the
right
to
contact
the
mean
high
--
water
line,
and
i
think
there's
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
contact
the
mean
high-water
line
and
the
water's
edge.
the
florida
supreme
court
didn't
address
the
former
issue,
contact
with
the
mean
high-water
line.
that's--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--right.
across
the
foreshore,
yes,
your
honor.
and
also,
as
part
of
the
common
law
rights
of
access--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--that's
correct.
we
have
that
right--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
point
i
was
getting
to.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
i
think
the
statute
provides
no
permanent
structures
can
be
constructed
on
that
new
property.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
it
certainly
does.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
it
says
that
the
--
you
know,
your
regular
common
law
uses
that
cannot
be--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--yes.
yes.
it's
says
no
uses
of
that
property
can
be
injurious
to
the
common
law--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--of
course,
now--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--yes,
the
legislature
can
change
this
definition
of
property.
they
can
define
property
in
the
state
of
florida
as
to
whatever
they
want
it
to
be,
but
if
they
do
so
and
take
property,
they
must
pay
for
it
under
the
just
compensation
clause--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--if
somebody
wanted
to
put
one
in
the
water,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
we
had
no
exclusive
right
to
exclude
them
from
that
property.
but
they
could
not
unnecessarily
interfere
with
our
right
to
view
or
our--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--yes.
the
ecl
in
this
case,
as
the
case
was
litigated,
was
assumed
to
be
located
directly
on
top
of
the
mean
high-water
line.
we
did
not
abandon
a
challenge
to
the
ecl.
what
we
abandoned
was
any
challenge
as
to
where
the
ecl
was
placed
in
relation
to--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
it
certainly
could
sit
in
a
foot
of
water.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
anybody
allowed--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--absolutely,
your
honor.
the
value
of
beachfront
property
is
a
premium.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
in
this
case--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--the
foreshore,
your
honor,
is
typically
the
land
area
between
the
mean
high-water
line
and
the
low
high-water
line,
and
depending
on
the
tide
cycles
of
the
day,
some
of
that
foreshore
is
dry,
and
then
at
other
times--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--there's
--
the
foreshore,
your
honor,
which
is
periodically
dry
on
any
given
day
and
periodically
wet
--
the
public
can
use
that,
and
they
have
always
been
able
to
use
that.
that
is
state-owned
land,
and
they
can
use
that
to
traverse
up
and
down
the
beach.
but,
again,
because
it's
wet
every
day,
you
don't
have
hot
dog
vendors
putting
hot
dog
stands
in
the
water.
you
don't
have
people
laying
their
blankets
in
the
water
to
enjoy
that
beach.
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
exclusive
right
to
use
the
dry
sand
area
that
stays
dry
all
of
the
time
in
our
case,
which
in
our
case
was
a
200-foot
stretch
of
beach
before
this
project
began,
and
we
had
200
feet
of
beach,
and
we
had
the
right
to
exclude
commercial
vendors
or
anybody
else
from
that
property.
now
what
we
have
after
that,
according
to
this
project,
is
another
80
feet
to
100
feet
of
dry
sand
beach
owned
by
the
state
where
the
landowners
have
no
ability
to
exclude
commercial
vendors
or
any
other
obnoxious
uses
of
that
property--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
it's
our
position
that
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
public
use
under
the
takings
clause,
can
condemn
that
property
and
make
a
public
beach
in
front
of
a
private
one.
they
absolutely
can
do
that.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
landowners
own
that
new
80-foot
stretch
of
beach
now,
as
it
currently
exists.
what
we
argue
is
we
own
to
the
erosion
control
line,
which
is
the
property
boundary
that
the
state
created
in
this
case.
and
the
state,
by
operation
of
the
act,
claims
title
to
the
new
80-foot
strip
of
beach.
and
what
we're
trying
to
obtain
here
is
the
state
to
go
through
eminent
domain
proceedings
to
pay
us
compensation
for
the
loss
of
littoral
rights
that
they're
taking
by
creating
this
public
strip
of
beach.
now,
the
state
may
at
the
end
of
the
day
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
claim
title
to
that;
we're
going
to
reinstate
your
boundary
as
the
mean
high-water
line
--
that
would
be
80
feet
further
out
--
and
no
compensation,
in
that
case,
would
be
due.
but--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--as
the
owner
of
the
property,
your
honor?
if
the
state
owned
that
property?
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
okay.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
the
state
already
has
broad
authority
to
regulate
property
already,
and
then
would
--
i
wouldn't
see
any
need
for
them
to
have
any
broader
authority
for
that
new
strip
of
beach
if
our
members
owned
it.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
any
greater
rights
to
that.
i
mean,
if
--
if
the
landowners
are
the
fee-simple
title
owner,
then
the
state
has
its
basic
police
powers
to
regulate
as
it
would
any
other
land,
absent
some
type
of
easement
or
reservation
of
our
agreement
with
the
landowners
that
give
them
greater
rights
and--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--ecl.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
that
--
that
may
well
be
the
case,
your
honor,
but,
again,
they
haven't
provided
us
the
opportunity
to
go
to
that
trial,
that
jury
trial,
to
argue
that
these
--
the
value
of
this
new
75-foot
stretch
of
beach
on
top
of
the
200-foot
stretch
of
beach
provides
value
above
and
beyond
the
taking
of
the--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--yes,
your
honor,
they
are
able
to
offset
that,
and
the
--
the
statute
provides
for
that
offsetting
such
that
in
an
eminent
domain
proceedings
whatever
value
the
landowners
lost
as
a
result
of
their
--
losing
their
contact
with
the
mean
high-water
line,
that
any
benefit
provided
by
the
additional
sand
would
be
offset--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--that
--
that
is
according
to
the
statute
that
was
passed,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
no,
your
honor.
our--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
members,
they
thought
it
was
a
bad
deal,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
i
think
that's
the
fundamental
misunderstanding
in
this
case.
the
beach
was
not
eroding.
it
was
not
lapping
under
these
houses.
there
was
200
feet
of
dry
beach,
and
the
beach
is
accreting,
meaning
it
grows
gradually,
day
by
day
or
week
by
week--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--with
the
exception
of
hurricanes.
but
hurricanes
are,
again,
avulsive
events
that
don't
change
the
property
boundary
line.
we
talked
about
the
right
to
reclaim
earlier.
so
this
is
an
a
accreting
beach,
200-foot
accreting
beach.
these
property
owners
did
not
view
that
they
were
gaining
anything--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--that's
a
risk
that
they
--
petitioner's
members
--
were
willing
to
take.
they
bought
oceanfront
property.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
sure.
sure,
your
honor,
there
are
a
lot
of
properties,
probably
even
in
this
stretch,
where
water
is
lapping
under
the
houses,
and
the
--
and
the
landowners
will
want
sand,
and
they'll
be
willing
to
waive
any
types
of
property
rights
claims
or
compensation
claims
to
get
that
sand.
but
that's
not
what
happened--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--in
this
case.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
yes.
there's
no
reason
they
couldn't,
because
they
own
the
fee-simple
title
to
it,
as
well
as
they
could
send
the
sovereign
submerged
lands
in
front
of
the
property.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be,
your
honor.
the
statute
provides
that
right
of
access--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--so
basically
it's
not
an
easement
per
se
that
inheres
in
our
title.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
yes,
but
we
don't
have
common
law
rights
anymore,
your
honor,
because
we
don't--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--contact
the
mean
high-water
line.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
under
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
yes,
because
it
purports
to
reserve
common
law
rights
across
this
new
stretch
of
state-owned
beach.
it's
our
contention
that
all
common
law
rights
have
been
lost
when
we
lose
connection
to
the
mean
high-water
line.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
the
test
that
we
would
suggest,
as
justice
stewart
noted
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
hughes.
and
the
test
we
would
propose
is
that
a
judicial
taking
occurs
when
a
state
court
effects
a
sudden
and
dramatic
change
in
state
law,
unpredictable
in
terms
of
relevant
precedents,
that
have
no
fair
or
substantial
support
in
well-established
background
principles
of
state
law.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
your
honor,
i
think
the
test-again,
the
fair
and
substantial
support
--
provides
adequate
deference
to
the
state
court.
and
in
objectively
reviewing
the
precedents,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
become
an
expert
in
state
law.
it
merely
has
to
review
those
precedents
to
make
sure
that
the
florida
supreme
court
in
fact
relied
on
background
principles
of
law
rather
than
creating
nonexistent
rules
of
state
substantive
law--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--yes,
the
case
law,
your
honor,
and
the
incremental
changes
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
that
would
be
part
of
your
test
is
the
government
or
the
state
can
gradually
change
these
property
rights
or
property
laws
so
long
as
they
leave
the
owner
with
the
rights.
and
in
this
case
what
the
florida
supreme
court
has
done
is
said:
we're
not
just
gradually
changing
them
and
leaving
you
with
these
common
law
littoral--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--we're
taking
them.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
right.
we're
taking
them.
what
the
petitioner's
members
possessed,
the
state
now
possesses.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
yes,
the
martin
v.
busch
case.
that--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--that
case,
ironically,
has
--
has
been
relied
upon
by
the
state
at
the
florida
supreme
court
level.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
it's
not
weird,
because
in
1987
in
the
sand
key
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
the
proposition
that
the
state
has
cited
that
case
for
was
not
the
issue
there
in
that
case.
it
said
that
case
dealt
with
a
property
boundary
dispute.
it
didn't
deal
even
deal
with
the
doctrine
of
avulsion
or
reliction
or
accretion.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
i
do
think
that's
true,
because
the
majority
in
sand
key
said
that
it
dealt
with
them.
[laughter]
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
thank
you.
[laughter]
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
martin
v.
busch
does
not
stand
for
the
principles
that
the
respondents
suggest
they
do.
the
court
in
sand
key
said,
and
in
--
and
in
distinguishing
the
martin
v.
busch
case,
and
i
quote,
"our
subsequent
decisions
show
there
was
no
intent
to
change
common
law
principles
regarding
the
right
to
accretion
and
relictions
in
martin
v.
busch.
"
and
even
if
it
did
stand
for
that
principle,
the
martin
v.
busch
case
didn't
discuss
whether
the
landowner
was
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
severance
of
their
waterfront
property
as
a
result
of
the
lowering
of
the
water.
what
also
must
be
noted
here
is
the
state
is
changing
the
deeds.
they're
changing
the
legal
description
and
the
deeds
of
the
petitioner's
members.
these
petitioner's
members
own
to
the
mean
high-water
line.
they
have
a
right,
not
only
under
florida
common
law
to
own
to
the
mean
high-water
line;
under
their
deeds,
that's
what
they
purchased.
and
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
and,
i
think,
maybe
some
confusion
about
this
right
to
contact
the
water.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
no,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
temporarily,
your
honor,
because
under
the
doctrine
of
reclamation,
they
can
reclaim
the
boundary
line
that
they
lost,
just
as
if
in
a
case
where
the
hurricane
washes
sand
away,
the
landowner,
under
common
law,
the
doctrine
of
reclamation,
can
bring
in
sand
where
the
water
is
to
reconnect
to
that
mean
high-water
line
that
would
be
underwater
following
a
hurricane.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
yes,
florida
law
allows,
under
the
doctrine
of
reclamation,
which
is
what
the
florida
supreme
court
relied
on--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--you'd
have
to
remove
the
sand.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
i'm
not
sure
the
common
law
envisioned
rock
coming
up
to--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--i
think
that's
wrong,
your
honor.
under
the
doctrine
of
reclamation--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--under
the
doctrine
of
reclamation,
they
can
reclaim
the
boundary
line.
if
that's
by
depositing
new
sand
where
the
water
is
to
reach
the
mean
high-water
line,
where
it
was
prior
to
the
hurricane.
they
can
do
that.
conversely,
if
sand
is
washed
up
as
a
result
of
a
hurricane,
they
can
remove
the
sand
to
bring
the
water
line
back
to
them.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
that
wouldn't
be
state
--
they
can
--
the
common
law
allows
them
to
reclaim
what
they're
lost
--
what
they
lost,
your
honor.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
tries
to
rely
on
this
doctrine
of
reclamation
in
this
case.
it
asserts
that
the
state
is
only
doing
what
it
was
allowed
under
common
law,
reclaiming
the
land
that
it
lost.
but
in
this
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
--
or
the
state
of
florida
didn't
ever
possess
any
dry
sand
land,
so
they
can't
reclaim
any
dry
sand
land.
the
only
thing
they
have
ever
owned
was
the
foreshore
and
the
sovereign
submerged
lands.
so
that's
the
only
thing
they
can
reclaim.
i
think
there
was
another
question
about
the
support
for
this
case.
there
is
more
than
five
landowners
that
don't
support
this
case.
in
the
lower
courts,
there
was
another
group,
save
our
beaches,
that
had,
i
believe,
roughly
150
members
that
opposed
this
project
as
well
in
the
city
of
destin.
in
this
case,
we're
also
dealing
with
a
physical
taking.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
lack
of
standing
at
the
administrative
hearing,
your
honor.
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case
is
a
physical
taking.
what
rights
were
physically
possessed
by
the
respondent's
members
--
the
petitioner's
members
in
this
case
are
now
possessed
by
the
state.
it's
a
wholesale
transfer
of
these
rights,
along
with
the
transfer
of
the
deed
--
or
the
description
of
the
deed.
we're
not
asking
this--
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
well,
they
haven't
gained
property,
your
honor,
because
the
state's
claiming
title
to
that
new
beach.
so
our
--
the
petitioner's
members
owned
exactly
what
they
owned
as
of
september
7,
2003,
when
the
property
boundary
was
changed,
and
the
new
boundary
would
--
the
new
land
would
be
state-owned.
mr.
d.
kent
safriet
thank
you.
