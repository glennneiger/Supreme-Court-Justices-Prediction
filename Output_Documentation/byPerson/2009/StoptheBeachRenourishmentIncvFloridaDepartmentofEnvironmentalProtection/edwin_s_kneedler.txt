mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
the
outset,
this
case
has
been
a
challenge
to
the
actions
of
the
florida
legislature
and
its
executive
branch
in
enacting
and
implementing
the
beach
restoration
act.
that
is
a
conventional
takings
claim
and
that
is
the
way
i
think
it
is
most
useful
for
this
court
to
approach
it.
rather
than
seizing
on
particular
statements
in
the
opinion
of
the
florida
supreme
court
and
regarding
the
florida
supreme
court's
judicial
act
as
itself
a
taking,
it's
best
to
focus
on
the
act
itself.
and
with
respect
to
the
act
itself,
what
--
what
has
happened
here
is
the
state
has
exercised,
not
just
sovereign
regulatory
rights;
it
has
exercised
critical
sovereign
proprietary
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
--
but,
in
fairness,
first
of
all,
that's
how
this
case
originated,
was
a
challenge--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
my--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--my
--
my
point
isn't
--
isn't
so
much
about
whether
it
could
have
been
raised
earlier.
it
is
that
what
--
what
is
--
what
is
being
objected
to
here
is
a
--
is
a
--
this
was
not
a
judicial
declaration,
for
example,
that
somebody
who
has
littoral
property
can
walk
up
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
can't
touch
it.
there
was
no
abstract
declaration
on
littoral
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
--
that
would
be
more
like
hughes.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
analyze
it
as
a
judicial
taking.
i
think
another
way--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
come
at
this
--
and
this
may
even
be
suggested
in
--
in
justice
scalia's
dissent
in
the
cannon
beach
case
--
is
that
the
--
the
usual
principle
that
where
state
law
is
interposed
in
a
way
that
would
--
would
defeat
a
federal
constitutional
right,
a
court
can
look
to
see
whether
there
is
a
fair
and
substantial
basis
for
it.
that's
not
really
a
--
there's
no
need
to
fashion
a
new
judicial
taking
doctrine
when
you
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
--
and
maybe
so,
but
--
but,
again,
i
think
it
--
it
would
be
possible
to
--
to
review
it
under
the
general
principle
about
whether
a
state
interpretation
of
state
law
that
would
defeat
a
claim
to
federal
right
would
be
without
any
fair
or
substantial
basis,
without
--
without
saying
that
the
supreme
court
itself
has
committed
an
unconstitutional
act.
it
--
it
could
be
looked
at
that
way.
but
if
i
--
but
if
i
could
turn
to
the
--
the
operation
of
this
statute,
what
--
what
has
happened
here
is
--
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases,
the
authority
of
the
state
over
its
submerged
lands
is
a
critical
aspect
of
sovereignty.
it
is
held
in
trust
for
the
public
and
for
public
uses,
and
what
has
happened
here
is
the
state,
with
respect
to
its
own
sovereign
lands,
has
filled
that
land.
that
does
not
change
the
ownership
of
the
sovereign
lands.
they
remain
sovereign
lands,
and
the
state
has
done
it
for
a
critical
public
purpose,
to
protect--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--accretion--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--accretion
would,
but
--
but
avulsion
or
rapid
change
would
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
don't
want
to
quibble,
but
i
think
it
depends.
the
--
the
florida
supreme
court's
decision
in
sand
key
was
a
situation
where
the
state
had
--
had
erected
a
jetty
or
an
offshore
structure
that
caused
sand
to
accrete
on
the
--
on
the
property,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
belongs
to
the
littoral
property
owner
under
the
doctrine
of
--
of
accretion.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
state
came
along
once
a
year,
on
one
day,
and
added
a
foot,
that
would
not
be
gradual
and
imperceptible,
but
would
be
quite
perceptible
because
the
state
would
have
added
a
foot
of
property.
and
even
though
it's
a
small
avulsion,
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
would
still
count
as
an
avulsion--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
--
the
difference
between
accretion
and
avulsion
is
whether
it's
gradual
and
imperceptible
or
whether
it's
--
whether
it's
dramatic
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
florida
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
--
in
the
peppe
case
relied
on
martin
v.
busch,
which
--
i
agree
with
justice
scalia,
it's
very
critical
here,
where
there
was
state
action
in
draining
the
lake,
which
exposed
the
surface
--
the
--
the
formerly
submerged
land,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
land
belongs
to
the
state,
it
was
action
by
the
state
in
a
dramatic
way.
and
florida--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
--
they
did
not
there,
but
in
--
but
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
my
point
was,
in
peppe,
where
--
where
there
was
actually
an
avulsion,
the
court
characterized
what
happened
in
martin
v.
busch
as
an
avulsive
act.
but
you
don't
need
to
label
avulsion,
because
there's
a
separate
doctrine
that
when
the
state
fills
its
own
land,
it
remains
its
own
land.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
--
this
is
not
a
unique
doctrine--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
i
think
it
is
surprising,
although
the
florida
supreme
court
did
discuss
avulsion,
but
if
--
if
i
could
just
make
one
point.
this
is
not
a
--
a
unique
notion
in
florida
law.
this
court's
decision
in
hughes
v.
washington,
which
dealt
with
accretion,
responded
to
the
--
to
the
point
that
was
--
that
was
made
there
and
said,
well,
the
--
the
littoral
property
right
is
vulnerable
anyway
because
the
owner
of
the
adjacent
submerged
lands
can
always
take
action
on
his
own
lands
that
could
affect
what
the
upland
property
owner
did.
and
this
--
and
this
court
said,
yes,
that's
right,
but
we're
talking,
here,
about
natural
causes.
and
in
--
in
hughes,
the
court
cited
two
cases,
one
in
washington
state,
for
example,
where
the
--
where
there
was
an
absolute
right
to
fill
the
submerged
lands
even
if
that
completely
cut
off
access.
it
also
pointed
out
another
case,
from
new
jersey,
where
--
where
the
--
a
case
of
this
--
from
this
court,
where
the
court
said,
you
have
a
right
to
accretion
as
long
as
nobody's
filled
the
land
in
between.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
once
the
land--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--again,
i
think
i
would
analyze
it
under
the
fair
and
substantial
basis.
but,
yes,
if
there
--
if
there
is
no
justification
in
background
law,
if
it's
basically
pretextual
in
the
same
way
that
--
that
any--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
pretextual,
but
if
there's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
--
but
the
phrasing
the
court
has
used
in
the
due
process
is
whether
it's
unforeseen
and
indefensible.
i
mean,
if
--
if
there's
just
--
if
there's
just
--
if
it's
just
ipse
dixit.
but
there
--
but
there
--
but
that's
by
no
means
true
here.
and
it's
important
that
martin
v.
busch
was
cited
in
the
two
--
and
distinguished
in
the
two
principal
cases
on
which
the
petitioner
relies
here.
in
sand
key,
the
court
distinguished
martin
v.
busch
on
the
ground
that
in
sand
key
it
was
an
accretion,
but
--
and
it
distinguished
martin
v.
busch
on
the
--
on
the
ground
that
there
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
sudden,
dramatic
action
by
the
state,
and
the
--
and
the
same
thing
was
also
true
in
the
florida
national
case,
where
the
--
the
court
again
distinguished--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--martin
v.
busch
on
that
ground.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
--
i
would
say
there
--
i
would
say
it's
tied
up
with
the
right
of
access,
as
long
as
the
littoral
property
owner
remains
adjacent
to
the
water.
but
what
you
have
here
is
a
neighboring
property
owner,
the
sovereign,
exercising
critical
sovereign
rights
over
its
property,
which
has
its
own
property
interests,
and
if
under
florida
law
the
--
the
state
is
permitted
to
put
sand
on
the
beach
--
this
is
--
this
is
not
filling
for
an
amusement
park.
this
is
adding
something
that
is
very
germane
to
the
maintenance
of
the
beach,
for
critical
public
purposes,
the
very
reasons--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
universal
theory
of
this.
as
i
--
as
i
said
in
--
in
the
port
of
seattle
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
it
varies.
and
in--
that
may
be
true
in
the
port
of
seattle
case
discussed
in
hughes,
where
the
state
had
the
--
you're
balancing
the
rights
of
adjacent
property
owners,
just
like
--
just
like
nuisance
or
other
principles
do.
in
washington
state,
apparently,
you
could
completely
fill
the
submerged
land
and
the
upland
owner
had
no
rights.
in
florida
--
florida
is
actually
more
protective
than
that.
it
has
limited
rights.
you
have
a
--
you
maintain
a
right
of
view,
a
right
against
unreasonable
interference.
so
there's
no
one
constitutionally
based
rule.
it's
a
question
of
florida
property
law.
and
the
background
principles
of
florida
property
law
under
martin
v.
busch
and
the
fact
that
the
state
owns
the
adjacent
land,
i
think,
not
only
is
there
--
there
is
more
than
a
fair
and
substantial
basis
here.
there
is
a
--
it's
very
solidly
grounded
in
state
law.
