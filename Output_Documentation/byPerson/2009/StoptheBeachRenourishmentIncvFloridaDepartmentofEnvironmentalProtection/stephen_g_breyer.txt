justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have
a
new
situation.
it's
sort
of
like
an
avulsion.
it's
sort
of
like
an
accretion.
the
only
precedent
of
--
you
keep
talking
about
a
hundred
years
--
it
seemed
to
me
some
dictum
in
a
case
called
sand
key,
which
does
say
that
the
upland
property
owner
has
the
right
to
touch
the
water.
so
in
this
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
says
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
make
certain
that
the
upland
property
owner
could
go
to
the
water.
and
so
here
we
have
a
case
that
assures
he
can
go
to
the
water,
and
they
have
a
new
situation,
which,
as
i
think
justice
scalia
said,
looks
an
awful
lot
like
an
avulsion,
though
of
course
there
are
differences.
so
it
sounds
like
a
typical
common
law
situation.
a
new
situation
arises.
you
try
to
apply
old
precedent,
and
they
reached
the
result
they
did.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
because
that's
the
argument
the
other
side
makes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
lose
any.
it
just
went
out
the
front
door
there.
the
land
ended
here,
and
the
new
avulsion
comes
in
and
extends
it
further.
you
didn't
lose
one
inch.
all
you
lost
was
the
right
to
touch
the
water.
but
the
court
here
says
you
in
effect
have
that
right
because
you
can
walk
right
over
it
and
get
to
the
water.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
you
have
a
right
to
walk
across
and
put
your
boat
in
the
water
and
swim,
and
nobody
can
stop
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
you
have
that
right.
they
didn't
take
that
away
from
you.
the
statute
gives
it
to
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
"absolutely
not".
i
thought
there
was
a
provision
in
this
law
that
said
they
cannot
put
anything
on
that
strip
which
destroys
your
right
of
enjoyment
of
the
upland
right.
now,
if
they
put
a
noisy
hot
dog
stand
that
keeps
you
up
at
night,
doesn't
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
your
right
to
peaceful
enjoyment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
does
it
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
does
the
statute
say
about
your
right
to
have
peaceful
enjoyment
of
your
land?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
injurious,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
they
say
is
the
following
--
this
is
what
they
say,
i
think:
they
point
to
a
case
called
sand
key,
and
in
sand
key
it
says
littoral
property
rights
include
the
following
vested
rights:
one,
the
right
of
access
to
the
water,
including
the
right
to
have
the
property's
contact
with
the
water
remain
intact.
that's
what
the
court
said.
and
in
the
court's
opinion
what
it
says
about
that
is
it
says,
in
this
case,
the
act
expressly
protects
the
right
of
access
to
the
water,
which
is
the
sole
justification
for
the
subsidiary
right
of
contact.
so
what
they're
doing
is
their
reading
what
they
said
in
sand
key,
and
they're
asking
why
was
it
there
in
sand
key,
and
that's
what
they
come
up
with.
now,
after
this
sentence
i
just
read
you,
there
is
no
citation.
so
i
want
you
to
add
anything
you
would
like
to
say
why
this
is,
that
sentence
i
read
you,
justifiable
under
florida
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
giving
you
what
i
took
was
--
i
don't
want
to
characterize
the
answer.
i
might
have
found
it
sufficient,
others
might
not
have.
i
don't
know.
i'm
saying
they
point
to
sand
key.
i've
read
you
what
i
thought
was
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tell
me
if
i'm
right,
and
if
i
am
right,
that
that
is
meant
to
be
the
answer,
justify
it,
if
you
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
do
we
have
to
say
that?
i
mean,
they're
writing
a
--
a
--
an
opinion
here
against
a
background
of
an
act,
and
as
i
read
that
opinion
--
you
can
add
something
to
this
if
you
want
--
i
make
a
list
of
what
they
say
in
effect
provides,
not
perfectly,
but
provides,
roughly,
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
the
sand
key
statement
provided.
one,
you
can
go
to
the
water;
two,
you
have
a
right
of
ingress
and
egress,
if
that's
any
different
from
the
first.
i'm
not
positive.
three,
you
have
a
right
under
the
act
that
nobody
can
put
anything
on
that
strip
which
is
injurious
to
the
upland
owner.
all
right?
so
those
are
at
least
three
things,
and
i
think
there's
a
fourth.
yes,
the
fourth
is
that
nobody
can
build
anything
there
that
is
harmful,
except
if
it's
to
do
with
the
environment;
that's
not
harmful,
that's
helpful
to
the
beach
owner.
it's
supposed
to
be
helpful.
and,
five,
you
get
your
beach
guaranteed.
so
all
of
those
things
are
things
you
get
under
this
act
in
an
intermediate
case
where
it's
a
little
like
an
avulsion
and
a
little
not
like
an
avulsion.
now,
do
i
add
anything
to
my
list?
and
do
you
have
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
what
more?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
the
question
here
that
the
reason
they
don't
under
florida
law
is
in
a
situation
where
the
law
isn't
clear,
we
draw
the
florida
law
this
way
rather
than
that
way,
and
that
is
a
reasonable
common
law
decision
because
of
the
six
points
that
we've
listed
on
the
list?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
not
that
it's
a
taking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you're
compensating;
it
is
a
reason
why
this
is
a
--
i
am
somewhat
putting
words
in
your
mouth,
but
i
mean
----
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
not?
because
--
because
what
they
said
is:
we
have
a
right
to
touch
the
water,
and
you've
taken
it.
that's
what
they
said
this
act
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
court
said:
you've
never
had
that
right.
and
it's
just
like
a
person
who
owns
40
acres
in
the
middle
of
vermont,
and
the
state
wants
to
build
a
nuclear
power
plant,
and
they
say,
you
have
to
pay
us.
no,
says
the
state.
and
the
court
of
the
state
upholds
it
on
the
ground
there
is
an
implicit
easement
under
blackstone
to
take
land
for
power
plants
without
paying
for
it;
it's
called
the
power
plant
easement.
okay?
now,
in
such
a
case,
it
would
be
the
judicial
taking
because
their
ground
is
not
--
whatever
you
normally
have,
but
their
ground
is
you
never
had
that
property
right
in
the
first
place.
now,
how
--
if
that
ever
were
to
happen
--
and
that
probably,
perhaps,
is
not
this
case,
but
if
that
ever
were
to
happen,
wouldn't
there
have
to
be
a
remedy
under
the
constitution
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
how
does
that
work?
i
mean,
i
have
a
beachfront
property;
i
wake
up
one
morning
and
there's
a
little
half-mile
island
attached
to
half
of
it,
and
there
we
are.
mean
high-water
mark
is
half
a
mile
away.
you
say
i
can
reclaim
that
under
florida
law?
what's
that
mean?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
--
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no.
this
is
--
you
can't.
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
rock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
can
happen.
okay.
so
my
point
is,
i
think,
which
is
the
same,
i
think,
as
justice
scalia,
that
he
--
that
the
upland
owner
no
longer,
under
the
law
of
florida,
has
a
way
of
getting
his
land
out
to
the
mean
high-water
mark.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
because?
