justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this
question
on
florida
valuation.
assume
you
prevail,
there's
a
cause
of
action
for
a
taking.
you
have
a
beachfront
area,
beachfront
home,
in
which
there's
a
hurricane
and
there's
a
loss
of
the
beach
and
a
sudden
drop,
so
that
it's
now
a
60-foot
--
a
60-foot
drop.
the
state
comes
in
and
says
the
only
way
we
can
fix
this
is
to
extend
the
beach
and
make
it
a
larger
beach
on
what
was
formerly
our
submerged
land.
and
it
does
that
that.
under
--
and
it
--
and
it
has
the
same
rule.
under
your
view,
is
the
state
required
to
pay
you
for
the
loss
of
your
right
of
contact
to
the
beach,
your
littoral
right,
because
there's
let's
say
another
100
foot
of
new
beach?
are
they
entitled
to
offset
that
against
the
enhanced
value
to
your
property
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they've
saved
it
from
further
erosion
and
have
given
you
a
beach
where
there
was
none
before?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
enhancement
from
the
post-project
benefit
is
a
credit
to
the
state
in
the
takings
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
would
be
subject
to
the
easement
that
the
state
acknowledges
you
have,
which
is
the
easement
of
access?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
--
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
no.
as
i
understand
the
supreme
court's
opinions,
you
have
several
special
and
exclusive
--
or
exclusive
--
or
exclusive,
common
law
littoral
rights:
right
to
have
access,
right
to
reasonable
use
of
the
water,
right
to
accretion
and
reliction,
right
to
the
unobstructed
view.
they
can't
sell
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
hypothetical
is
the
state
says
that
the
property
owner,
the
upland
owner,
has
these
rights.
the
chief
justice
asked
you,
could
this
property
be
sold?
i
think
the
answer
would
be
yes,
but
it
would
be
subject
to
the
continuance
of
that
easement
in
the
dominant
estate.
that
has
to
be
the
answer
under
the
supreme
court's
opinion.
now,
you
may
not
agree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
that
gets
to
the
question,
if
we
agree
with
you
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
judicial
takings,
what
is
the
standard
by
which
we
decide
when
the
federal
courts
can
and
must
intervene
to
disagree
with
the
--
with
the
state
law
and
to
characterize
it
as
a
taking
when
the
state
has
said
that
it
is
not?
would
we
just
find
all
sorts
of
adjectives
--
it's
sudden,
unexpected,
unfounded
--
we
just
have
a
string
of
adjectives,
sort
of
like
an
adequate
independent
state
ground
rule
or
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
i'm
familiar
with
that
opinion.
now,
in
this
case,
number
one,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
do
that,
we
have
to
become
real
experts
in
florida
law.
number
two,
once
we
do
that
it
seems
to
me
that
this
opinion
really
addresses
something
that's
--
that's
new,
and
it's
--
it's
grounded
in
common
law
doctrines.
it's
a
close
case.
it
might
have
gone
either
way.
let's
assume
that.
does
there
have
to
be
some
finding
that
the
state
decision
is
clearly
unreasonable?
i
mean,
if
it's
a
close
case,
does
the
state
win
under
your
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that,
reading
the
opinion,
i
--
i
can
get
there.
there
was
some
talk
about
the
belvedere
case
as
helping
you.
i
thought
it
did
not
at
all.
that
was
a
very
odd
case
where
the
easement
is
wholly
separated
from
the
dominant.
it's
the
reverse.
they
take
the
main
property
and
leave
the
easement,
rather
than
vice
versa.
so
i
just
thought
that
was
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
state
can
do
an
accretion--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
not
an
avulsion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
problem
with
the
argument
that
i'm
having
is
that
in
the
last
colloquy
with
justice
breyer,
we
heard
how
reasonable
this
act
was.
that's
one
thing.
but
you
have
taken
the
position
that
it's
your
property
and
you
can
do
with
it
what
you
want
anyway.
now,
maybe
in
this
case
it
won't
make
a
difference,
because
it's
so
reasonable,
it's
--
there's
not
a
taking.
but
what
about
--
what
do
you
call
those
--
the
spring
fling,
the
spring
break--
[laughter]
--hypothetical,
or
a
permanent
oceanography
museum?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
you
think
there's
a
taking
as
a
matter
of
georgia
--
pardon
me,
of
florida
law
if
enjoyment
of
the
view
and
access
is
substantially
impaired?
i
mean,
is
that
the
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
either
all
of
the
time
or
some
of
the
time
a
public
beach
would
--
that
intervenes
between
the
upland
and
the
water
would
be
a
substantial
impairment
of
the
upland
owner's
rights?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that's
exactly
my
point.
you
say
that
the
state
owns
the
beach,
and
it's
okay
because
there's
a
protection
against
unreasonable
use.
and
i'm
asking
whether
or
not
a
state
beach
with,
what
do
you
call
them,
port-a-johns
and
hot
dog
stands
and
so
forth,
isn't
a
substantial
impairment
of
the
upland
owner's
use?
and
you
say,
well,
the
state
owns
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that
takes
away
from
your
earlier
argument
that
we
don't
need
to
worry
because
there
can
be
no
interference
with
substantial
enjoyment.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
alito's
question
has
still
not
been
answered
in
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
you
to
talk
to
me
about
what
the
constitutional
law
ought
to
be
in
this
case
as
a
general
matter.
we'll
figure
out
facial
and
--
and
as-applied
later.
i
still
see
that
your
argument
leaves
open
this
question
in
my
mind
raised
by
the
concerns
that
justice
alito
has
expressed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
when
they
do,
they're
going
to
be
met
by
you
when
you're
in
the
trial
court
and
you
say
the
state
owns
the
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
authority
is
there
in
florida
law
or
in
general
law
to
say
that
the
act
of
an
--
an
artificial
person
is
an
accretion
or
avulsion,
instead
of
just
an
act
of
nature?
what
--
what
case
do
i
read
or
authority
do
i
read?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
did
they
call
it
an
avulsion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that
--
so
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
