mr.
scott
d.
makar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
the
court:
let
me
go
ahead
and
address
some
issues
that
have
come
up
about
florida
law.
number
one,
this
idea
of
artificial
avulsion
that
was
discussed
earlier,
the
bryant
v.
peppe
case,
which
cites
the
martin
--
that
was
discussed
in
the
martin
case,
talks
about
when
the
state
comes
in
on
its
own
property
and
either
lowers
the
water
or,
in
this
case,
puts
sand
on
the
--
on
the
state
side
of
the
property
line,
that
that's
an
artificial
avulsion,
the
state
retains
title
to
its
state
lands,
the
upland
owner,
the
private
property
owner
retains
ownership
of
their
land.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
it
would
be
an
avulsion.
it
would
still
be
the
state
adding
sand
to
its
side
of
the
line.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
if
it's
on
--
if
it's
on
its
property,
that's
absolutely
the
case.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
no,
no.
under,
florida
law
the
bryant
v.
peppe
case,
which
was
an
avulsion
case
that
arose
out
of
a
hurricane,
where
there
was
land
that
was
previously
submerged,
it
came
up,
it
was
over
state
property,
the
private
owners
wanted
to
get
the
--
get
it,
and
they
asserted
that
it
was
theirs
in
accretion,
and
the
court
said
no,
and
it
cited
to
martin.
there's
no
right
to
having
contact
with
the
water.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
but
it
was
done
by
the
state.
i'm
sorry,
maybe
i'm
confusing
cases.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
martin--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--oh,
no,
no,
no.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
no,
no,
no.
an
--
an
accretion
would
have
to
be
a
sudden,
imperceptible
change
in
the
shore
line.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
when
the
state
adds
to
its
side
of
the
line,
adds
sand
in
this
case,
that's
not
a
gradual,
imperceptible--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--oh,
well,
sure.
no,
it's--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
if
it's
gradual
and
perceptible--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
it
would
be
yes.
and
if
the
state
came
in
and
took
that
property,
yes.
the
100
years--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--on
these
facts--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i
would
disagree
with
that,
because
what
--
that
is
not
a
gradual
imperceptible
change.
it's
a
--
water.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
we
are,
i
think,
because
in
this
case
what
happened--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
that's
--
but
that's
not
the
way
it
is
under
--
under
florida
law,
if
the
state
comes
in
on
its
own
property
and
adds
to
it,
as
it
did
in
martin,
where
it
lowered
the
--
the
water
or
in
this
case
where
they
added
the
sand,
it
--
the
state
retains
the
right
to
it.
the
upland
owner
doesn't
get
it.
it's--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no,
absolutely--
[laughter]
no,
absolutely
not.
i
mean,
what
the
state
did
here
is
it
--
40
years
ago,
was
to--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
maybe
we're
on
mars
and
venus
here
because
we're
talking
about
a
label.
we're
talking
about
the
state's--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
there's
no
question
under
florida
law
that
the
state
has
the
right
on
its
sovereignty
lands
to
control
those
lands
and
use
those
for
the
public
trust.
and
what
the
florida
legislature
did
40
years
ago
--
keeping
in
mind
this
has
been
on
the
books
40
years,
200
miles
of
beaches
have
been
restored
over
those
years,
and
no
one
has
complained
that
this
is
a
taking
of
property.
that
--
it's
a
reasoned
response
for
the
florida
supreme
court
to
come
in
and
say,
okay,
they're
challenging
the
act.
they
say
it
denies
them
two
things:
the
right
to
future
accretion
and
the
right
to
have
contact
with
the
water.
martin
v.
busch
and
bryant
v.
peppe
say,
look,
if
--
you
don't
have
a
right
of
contact
with
the
water,
if
you
have
avulsion
or
if
you
have
it
in
--
in
martin,
it
was
a
state
drainage
project.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
sure.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
i
think
under
the
scenario
you're
posing
that's
a
possibility.
that's
where
the--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
think
it
would
--
if
it
--
if
it's
--
it
sounds
like
this
is
the
cannon
beach
situation,
where
the
court
judicially
said,
okay,
you
don't
own
to
the
mean
high-water
line;
now
you
own
up
--
only
up
to
the
vegetation
line.
or
something
along
those
lines
where
it
was
an
ouster.
here
there's
no
ouster
of
property
rights.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
right.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
yes,
i
would
--
i
would
countenance
that
--
that
here
we
have
a
far
different
situation,
which
we
have
an
act
of
the
legislature
that
draws
this
line,
and
that
the
two
attributes
that
they
are
claiming
have
no
basis
whatsoever
in
background
principles
of
florida
law.
there
is
no
case
they
can
point
to,
to
say
that
we
have
a
right
of
contact--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
you're
talking
about
the
legislation.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
i'm
talking
about
the
sand
key--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--oh,
sure.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
sure.
what
they're
citing
to
is
some
dicta
in
sand
key
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
holding
of
that
case,
and
if
you
try
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
citations
to
the
cases
that
sand
key
cites
for
that
proposition
of
contact
with
the
water,
none
of
them
have
to
do
with
contact
with
water.
instead,
the
most
important
point
is
to
look
at
martin
v.
busch,
which
was
a
case
where
the
state
lowered
the
water
in
a
lake,
the
upland
owners
at
--
the
property
line
was
determined
not
to
have
moved,
they
didn't
have
any
contact
with
the
water
any
longer,
and
the
submerged
sovereignty
lands
became
the
state's
property.
there's
no
right
of
contact
there.
it's--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no.
well,
two
points
here
i
would
like
to
make.
number
one,
let's
assume
there
was
an
avulsive
event
that
added
sand
on
the
state's
property
along
the
beach
line,
so
now
we
have
the
property
line
not
changing,
it's
exactly
where
it
was
before,
but
now
we
have,
say,
75
feet
of
sand,
new
sand
seaward,
over
the
state's
property.
that's
the
state's
property--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--but
--
but
--
well
--
but
under
this
avulsive
event
where
there
is
sand
added
seaward,
the
contact
by
the
upland
owner
with
the
water
no
longer
exists,
and
that's
been
on
the
books
in
florida
for--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
put
the
act
aside
and
just
say
at
common
law
in
florida.
if
the
sand
is
added
through
avulsive
events,
the
upland
owner
has
no
contact
with
the
water
any
longer.
they
certainly
have
access.
and
the
florida
act
is
so
solicitous
of
protecting
the
property
rights
of
riparian
ownership.
you
go
through
the
statute,
and
you
see
they
preserve
common
law
littoral
--
littoral
rights.
they
have
a
section--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--that
was
my
second
point.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
absolutely,
absolutely.
and
that's
a
major
misnomer
in
this
case,
is
that
the
upland
owner
here,
even
after
the
beach
restoration
project,
has
riparian
littoral
property.
that's
what
the
florida
supreme
court
has
held,
that's
what
the
florida
legislation
says.
there's--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i
--
i
would
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
but
it's
not
his
--
it's
not
their
property.
it's
the
state's--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
--
i
agree
that's
what
they
have
tried
to
make
it
about.
what
they've
said
is
the
state
now
has
this
swath
of
sand.
it's
a
barrier
to
protect
against
erosion.
it's
no
wider
than
this
courtroom.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
justice
alito,
in
response,
what
i'd
say
here
is
keep
in
mind
this
is
the
beach
and
shore
preservation
act.
it
isn't
designed
to
create
some
recreational
playground
for
spring
breakers.
it's
designed
to--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
not
under
the
act,
because
--
here's
why:
under
the
act,
what
has
to
be
done
is
a
survey.
and
you'd
have
the--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
if
there
was
--
if
there
were
some
other
act
where
the
legislature
passes
a
law--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
they
--
they
would,
but
the
point
being
is
that
they
would
have
to
preserve
the
littoral
rights
of--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no,
well,
there's
--
there's
even
more,
justice
breyer.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
what
the
legislature
in
florida
did
as
well
is
to
say
that
when
they
do
the
survey,
as
you
see
in
the
document
attached
in
the
joint
appendix,
they
have
to
set
out
what
the
width
of
the
berm
will
be,
the
sacrificial
sand
that's
there
to
erode
away
over
time.
they
put
the
width
in
there.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
it's
about
75
feet.
and
it's
going
to
erode
away.
that
cannot
be
increased
without
the
consent
of
the
owners--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
under
background
principles
of
florida
law,
they
have
no
right
to
contact
with
the
water,
and
this
accretion
right
is--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--but
under
--
with
due
respect,
under
florida
law,
they
don't.
and
the--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--absolutely.
given
this--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--absolutely.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
certainly
our
position
is
that
there's
no--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--other
than
these
petitioners,
justice
ginsburg,
no
one
has
complained
about
this
and
said
that
--
and
brought
an
action
or
--
or
otherwise.
this
is
a
very
beneficial
program.
it's
basically
a
beachfront
property
protection
act,
so
it's
sort
of
anomalous
that
anyone
would
complain--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--sure,
justice
kennedy.
we
have
cases
in
florida,
for
example,
where
a
bridge
was
built
entirely
across
the
view
of
the
--
of
the
river,
and
the
upland
owner
in
that
situation
had
a
total
impairment
of
their
right
to
view,
and
that's
compensable.
so
--
so
--
but
here
what
we
have--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--right.
that
said--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--that's
the
law
in
florida,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
if
there's
a
substantial
impairment.
there's
cases
that
say
that--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--sure,
if
they
took
away
the
--
the
swath
of
littoral
rights
or
a
substantial
portion,
that
would
be
highly
problematic
and
likely
be
a
taking.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
no,
no,
no.
the
--
the
state
owns
the
beach,
and
let
me
make
this
analogy.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
believe
the
answer
is
that
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
there
could
be
an
as-applied
challenge.
keep
in
mind,
the
association
here
owns
no
property.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well
--
and
the
florida
supreme
court
was
very
careful
in
narrowing
its
decision
and
saying
that
the
actual
property
owners
may
pursue,
if
they
feel
--
beyond
this
opinion,
they
may
pursue
an
as-applied
claim,
where
they
--
this
has
no
takings
record
before
this
court
whatsoever,
and
that
would
have
to
be
developed,
keeping
in
mind
that
much--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
just
because
the
state
owns
the
property
doesn't
mean
there
cannot
be
an
impairment
of
the
--
of
the
right.
this
is
an
analogy
to
say
this
was
a
road
where
--
if
i
might--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--sure.
that
if
this
were
a
road
and
the
traffic
--
there's
a
country
road
and
there's
very
little
traffic,
and
over
the
years
the
traffic
built
up,
that
somehow
the
owner
of
the
property
along
that
road
would
have
a
cause
of
action.
it's
just
not
the
case.
thank
you
very
much.
