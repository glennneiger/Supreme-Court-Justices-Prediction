justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
--
they're
eliminated
--
at
least
the
right
of
contact
with
the
water
can
be
eliminated
by
an
avulsion,
right?
when
there's
--
when
there's
avulsion,
even
at
common
law
and
under
florida
law,
it
--
it
can
happen
that
some
land
between
the
property
owner
and
--
and
the
water
will
be
owned
by
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
wasn't
this
an
avulsion?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
well,
well,
well.
there
were
--
there
were
two
avulsions.
one
was
the
avulsion
of
its
being
washed
away
and
the
other
was
the
--
the
rapid
replacement
of
sand.
that
--
that
is
not
a
natural,
gradual
phenomenon.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
no
case
law,
it
seems
to
me
you've
lost
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
have
quiet
hot
dog
stands
during
the
daytime.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
such
--
such
boats
floating
in
--
in
the
water
below
the
mean
highwater
mark
are
available
with
respect
to
all
littoral
properties.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
can't
happen
with
other
littoral
property
is
that
folks
can't
come
in
and
lay
down
beach
blankets
and
occupy
that
sand,
right,
so
that
you
have
open
sand
in
front
of
--
in
front
of
your
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
people
pay
a
lot
more
money
for
beach
--
beachfront
homes,
for
that
reason,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
quite
different
from
having
a
house
behind
the
beach
at
coney
island,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
gave
you
some
quid
pro
quo
for
this,
which
is
to
say
this
new
sand
is
projected
to
last
6
years,
has
to
be
replaced
regularly,
because
your
--
your
property
is
being
eroded,
which
is
the
reason
the
state
went
into
this.
and
what
the
state
has
given
you
in
exchange
is
that
if
and
when
there
is
further
erosion,
you
will
continue
to
own
up
to
whatever
this
new
line
is
called.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ecl.
you
will
continue
to
--
to
own
up
to
there,
despite
the
fact
that
under
common
law
when
there's
more
erosion,
your
--
your
line
would
recede
to
the
new
mean
high-water
mark.
so,
you
know,
who
--
who
knows?
maybe
that's
sufficient
compensation.
you
know,
if
you
go
in
and
ask
for
compensation,
the
state
might
say,
you
know,
we've
given
them
--
given
them
this
property
right
in
exchange,
and
the
difference
between
that
and
what
they
have
now
is
two
dollars.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
any
of
these
beachfront
owners
think
this
was
a
good
deal,
that
the
state
has
prevented
further
erosion
of
their
land
and,
you
know,
the
price
they
pay
for
that
is
that
they
have
this
60-foot
stretch
that
--
that
the
public
can
use,
and
that
may
wash
away
in
6
years
anyway,
and
if
they're
lucky
the
state
won't
have
enough
money
to
put
it
back?
or
----
[laughter]
did
anybody
--
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
bad
deal.
and
they're
guaranteed
against
--
against
further
loss
of
property
because
they
will
continue
to
own
up
to
that
--
to
that
new
line,
even
if
it's
all
covered
by
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
--
nobody
thought
it
was
a
good
deal?
everybody
thought
that
they
had
been
done
out
of
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
petitioner's
members,
but
other
people
along
--
along
the
same
coast?
i
mean,
if
i
had
a
place
and
it's
being
--
it's
being
eroded
by
hurricanes
constantly,
you
know,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
i
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
want
to
have
the
sand
replaced,
even
at
the
--
at
the
cost
of
having
a
60-foot
stretch
that
the
state
owns.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
not
change
the
property
line,
but
all
of
your
property
might
be
under
water--
[laughter]
--right?
that
wouldn't
be
very
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
your
members
were,
but
i
was
asking
whether
some
other
people
might
not
have
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
martin
was
--
the
martin
case
was
--
was
pretty
close,
the
lake
that
--
that
the
state
lowered.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
--
did
the
florida
supreme
court
cite
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
weird?
why
didn't
they
cite
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
they
said
that.
do
you
think
that's
true?
when
i
read
it,
it
seemed
to
me
to
deal
with
reliction
precisely.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
good
lawyerly
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
thought
avulsion
by
definition
is
a
sudden
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
you're
--
we're
wandering
off
the
point.
why
wasn't
it
an
avulsion?
it
was
an
avulsion
in
that
case,
wasn't
it,
because
it
was
sudden?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
--
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
a
case
for
the
proposition
that
an
--
what
would
otherwise
be
an
avulsion
is
an
accretion
if
it's
done
by
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
vice
versa.
what
would
otherwise
be
an
accretion
is
an
avulsion
if
done
by
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
sand
key's
statement
strikes
one
as
--
as
correct
simply
because
i
think
that's
--
that's
the
view
of
the
common
law.
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
unique
or
distinctive
to
florida.
i
think
it
would
be
very
strange
to
have
a
principle
that
all
the
--
all
the
littoral
owner
gets
is
a
right
to
access
the
water
and
not
the
right
to
be
on
the
water,
to
have
his
property
on
the
water.
i
think
--
i
think
in
every
state,
beachfront
owners
would
be
astounded
to
learn
that
that's
the
case.
so,
i
--
you
know,
i
thought
that
sand
key
was
just
expressing
what
--
what
was
the
common
law.
and
the
notion
that
--
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
contact
with
the
water
is
so
that
you
can
have
access,
that
is
--
is
that
not
silly?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
person
still
be
considered
a
littoral
owner?
justice
antonin
scalia
after
there
has
been
the
avulsive
event
that
separates
him
from
the
ocean
by
60
feet
of
state-owned
land,
would
he
still
be
a
--
a
riparian
owner?
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he's
not
talking
about
the
act.
he's
just
talking
about
your
theory
of
the
case.
your
theory
of
what
the
rights
of
beachfront
owners
consist
of
would
permit
this
to
happen,
if
not
under
this
act,
under
some
other
act,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
well,
it's
the
spring
break
act
of
2010,
okay?
[laughter]
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
under
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
won't
disagree
with
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wouldn't
own
to
the
mean
high-water
mark
if
there
were
an
avulsion,
if
--
right?
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
by
nature,
this
60-foot
beach
had
been
put
in,
then
their
deed
would
be
changed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
shovel
away
the
sand.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it's
going
the
opposite
way?
what
if
it's
--
if
they
built
up
sand?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
go
on
the
state
land
to
do
that?
because
that
sand
is
sitting
on
state
land.
