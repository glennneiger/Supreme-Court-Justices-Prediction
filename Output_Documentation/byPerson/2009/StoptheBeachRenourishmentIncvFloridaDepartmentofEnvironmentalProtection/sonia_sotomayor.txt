justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
before
this
legislation,
in
the
seaward
side
of
the
land
that
belonged
to
the
state,
from
the
mean
high-water
mark,
a
hot
dog
stand
could
have
sat
in
the
water,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
someone
could
have
stood
there,
a
boat
could
have
docked
there,
assuming
that
it
--
it
was
a
shallow
boat.
you
had
no
control
over
anyone
placing
anything
on
the
seaside
submerged
lands
that
belonged
to
the
state,
outside
of
whatever
regulations
the
state
decided
it
wanted
to
impose?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
ecl
that
has
been
created
by
this
legislation
--
you
gave
up
any
challenge
to
it
--
it
was
established
at
that
mean
water
mark,
wasn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
right
now,
we
just
have
to
assume
that
it
was
--
that
it
--
it
has
established
the
line
at
a
point
where
the
state
owns
all
the
land
seaward
of
the
ecl,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
after
this
project
finishes,
that
hot
water
--
that
hot
dog
vendor
will
be
on
stateside
land,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
different
than
what
exists
today,
before
the
legislation,
which
is
if
the
hot
dog
vendor
wanted
to
sit
in
a
foot
of
water,
it
could
have?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
none
of
your
actual
use
rights,
pleasure
rights,
or
anything
else
has
been
changed.
what
you're
arguing
is
that
--
and
what
the
florida
state
supreme
court
described
as
the
contingent
future
possibility
that
the
high-water
mark
might
change
and
you
could
push
that
hot
dog
vendor
back
another
foot
or
two.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
you
have
answered
justice
scalia's
question
that
there's
a
common
--
a
generally
understood
common
law
right,
littoral
right,
to
contact
with
the
water?
would
you
say
there
is
not?
