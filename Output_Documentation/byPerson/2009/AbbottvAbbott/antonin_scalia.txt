how
many--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
has
to
be
psychological
harm
to
the
child;
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
psychological
harm
to
the
woman
who
can't
work
in
the
country
would
be
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
that
would
secondarily
affect
the
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
most
courts
in
countries
signatory
of
the
treaty
have
come
out
the
other
way
and
agree
that
a
ne
exeat
right
is
a
right
of
custody,
and
those
courts
include
the
u.k.,
france,
germany
--
i
believe,
canada.
very
few
come
out
the
way
you
--
how
many
come
out
your
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
i
mean--
[laughter]
you're
writing
our
opinion
for
us,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but,
still,
in
all,
i
mean,
they
include
some
biggies,
like
the
house
of
lords,
right?
and
--
and
the
purpose
of
a
treaty
is
to
have
everybody
doing
the
same
thing,
and
--
and
i
think,
we
--
if
it's
a
case
of
some
ambiguity,
we
should
try
to
go
along
with
what
seems
to
be
the
consensus
in
--
in
other
countries
that
are
signatories
to
the
treaty.

germany.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
australia
--
is
australia
unclear?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
according
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
if
this
is
inaccurate,
the
australian
court
followed
the
english
court
of
appeal's
decision
that
justice
ginsburg
referred
to,
emphasizing
the
desirability
of
uniform
interpretations
of
the
convention,
and
i
count
that
against
you,
the
australia.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
will
have
to
parse
them
out,
obviously.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
these
things
were
effective--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
wouldn't
--
we
wouldn't
have
a
treaty,
would
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
these
local
remedies
were
effective,
we
wouldn't
have
a
treaty.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
does
that
provision
of
texas
law
override
the
--
the
treaty
that
the
united
states
has
entered
into?
justice
antonin
scalia
texas
can
ignore
the
treaty,
because
the
child
is
over
12
years
old?
