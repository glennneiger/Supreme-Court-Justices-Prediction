justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
have
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
what
if
--
what
if
you'd
have
a
country
in
which
ne
exeat
orders
are
routinely
imposed
in
every
custody
case?
then
it's
almost
like
your
statutory
case
here.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
custody?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
--
excuse
me,--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i'll
just
finish
my
own
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
are
saying
is
that,
in
some
countries,
there
--
there
is
a
presumption
that
there
is
always
custody
in
the
party
--
in
both
parties.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
long
as
you
brought
that
up,
i
was
just
going
to
ask:
should
--
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
should
there
be
a
remand
to
see
if
that
section
applies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying
--
i
know
the
white
light's
on
--
but
you
are
saying
that
every
case
that
involves
the
chilean
government,
the
convention
here
is
applicable,
requiring
return?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
every
case
originating
in
chile
must
come
out
this
way,
so
that
there
is
a
return
required?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
seems
to
me
remote
from
the
concept
of
custody
that
the
convention
has
in
mind.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
could
say
that
the
limitation
on
the
custodial
right
is
the
right
of
the
husband
to
visit
once
a
month
or
3
--
3
weeks
a
month.
i
--
i
think
that's
slightly
an
artificial
approach.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
--
that
cuts
both
ways
so
far
as
you
are
concerned,
because
it
includes
--
might
mean
that
custody
includes
the
right
to
insist
on
living
in
a
specific
country.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
textually,
that's
certainly
plausible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
one
question
for
the
other
counsel
and
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
ask
it.
if
the
respondent
were
return
to
chile,
would
she
face
criminal
charges
or
contempt
charges?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
ne
exeat
order--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
was
going
to
say
the
ne
exeat
order,
under
your
view,
is
the
one
order
that
can't
be
enforced
anyplace.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
--
but
that's
a
defense
to
a
removal
order.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
is
08-645,
abbott
versus
abbott.
mr.
and
mrs.
abbott
moved
to
chile
with
their
young
son.
now,
there
was
marital
discord.
the
couple
separated.
the
chilean
courts
granted
the
mother
daily
care
and
control
over
the
boy
while
awarding
the
father
regular
visitation
rights.
the
chilean
law
also
conferred
upon
the
father
ne
exeat
right.
now,
a
ne
exeat
right
allows
a
parent,
and
here
it
was
father,
to
consent
before
the
other
parent
can
take
the
child
out
of
the
country.
this
right
was
of
no
avail
however,
the
mother
took
the
boy
out
of
chile
without
the
father's
consent
and
this
abduction
violated
the
father’s
ne
exeat
right.
both
parents,
both
parties
agree
on
that
point.
the
father
found
ms.
abbott
and
the
boy
in
texas.
the
father
brought
this
suit
in
united
states
district
court.
he
sought
an
order
requiring
his
son’s
return
to
chile
under
the
hague
convention
on
the
civil
aspects
of
international
child
abduction.
now
that
convention
is
a
treaty
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
congress
has
implemented
it
by
statute.
the
district
court
denied
the
father's
requested
remedy.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
both
parties
agree
too
that
the
convention
applies
to
this
dispute,
and
that's
because
the
boy
is
under
16
years
old.
he
was
a
habitual
resident
of
chile
and
both
chile
and
united
states
are
contracting
parties
to
the
convention.
the
disagreement
concerns
how
to
interpret
a
key
provision
in
the
convention
and
that
phrase
is
rights
of
custody
and
the
question
becomes
whether
or
not
the
ne
exeat
right
is
also
a
right
of
custody
under
the
convention.
if
the
ne
exeat
right
that
the
father
has
is
a
right
of
custody
then
the
father
may
assert
a
return
remedy
in
the
united
states
courts.
on
this
theory
the
trial
court
would
have
to
issue
an
order
directing
that
the
child
be
returned
to
chile
unless
certain
exceptions
apply.
this
court's
inquiry
is
shaped
by
the
text
of
the
convention,
the
views
of
the
united
states
department
of
state,
decisions
addressing
the
meaning
of
rights
of
custody
and
courts
of
other
contracting
states
and
the
purposes
of
the
convention
and
after
considering
these
sources
the
court
determines
that
the
father’s
ne
exeat
right
is
a
right
of
custody
under
the
convention.
the
convention
defines
rights
of
custody
to
include
rights
relating
to
the
care
of
the
person
of
the
child
and
in
particular
the
right
to
determine
the
child's
place
of
residence.
a
parent
holding
an
ne
exeat
right
has
both
the
right
to
determine
a
child's
place
of
residence
and
rights
relating
to
the
care
and
person
of
the
child.
the
phrase
place
of
residence,
does
encompass
the
child's
country
of
residence
and
this
is
especially
so
in
light
of
the
convention's
purpose
to
prevent
wrongful
removal
across
international
borders.
here
the
ne
exeat
right
gives
the
farther
a
joint
right
to
determine
his
son's
country
of
residence
as
the
boy
cannot
live
in
any
country
other
than
chile
with
the
father's
consent
--
without
the
father's
consent.
the
father’s
ne
exeat
right
also
give
him
rights
relating
to
the
care
of
the
person
of
the
child.
few
decisions
are
as
significant,
as
the
language
the
child
speaks,
the
identity
he
finds
or
the
culture
and
traditions
she
will
come
to
absorb.
these
factors
are
linked
in
an
inextricable
way
to
the
child's
country
of
residence,
one
need
only
consider
the
different
childhoods
a
child
would
experience
if
he
or
she
grew
up
in
the
united
states,
chile,
germany
or
north
korea
to
understand
how
taking
joint
part
in
choosing
the
child's
country
of
residence
is
a
right
related
to
the
care
of
the
person
of
the
child.
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
breach
of
ne
exeat
right
does
not
give
rise
to
return
remedy
would
render
the
convention
meaningless
in
many
cases
where
it
is
most
needed.
the
convention
provides
a
return
remedy,
when
a
parent
takes
a
child
across
international
borders
in
violation
of
a
right
of
custody.
the
conclusion,
the
court
reaches
in
today's
case
is
supported
and
informed
by
the
state
department's
view
that
ne
exeat
rights
are
rights
of
custody.
the
executive
is
well
informed,
concerning
the
diplomatic
consequences
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
convention.
this
includes
the
likely
reaction
of
other
contracting
states
and
the
impact
on
the
state
department's
ability
to
reclaim
children
who
are
abducted
from
this
country.
the
conclusion
that
ne
exeat
right
are
rights
of
custody
is
further
informed
by
the
views
of
other
contracting
states.
as
is
explained
in
today's
opinion,
the
court
has
consulted
cases
interpreting
the
convention
in
the
high
courts
of
the
united
kingdom,
israel,
austria,
south
africa
and
germany
and
the
opinion
discusses
those
cases.
they
all
agree
that
ne
exeat
rights
are
rights
of
custody.
it
is
true
on
the
other
hand
that
the
canadian
supreme
court
has
indicated
a
contrary
view
in
dicta
and
the
french
courts
are
divided,
yet
even
in
light
of
this
division,
the
court
and
scholars
in
this
area
agree
that
there
is
an
emerging
international
consensus
that
ne
exeat
right
are
rights
of
custody.
the
view
that
the
convention
provides
a
return
remedy
for
violation
of
ne
exeat
right,
accords
with
the
convention's
objects
and
purposes.
ordering
a
return
remedy
does
not
alter
the
allocation
of
custody
rights.
it
does
allow
the
courts
of
the
home
country
to
decide
what
is
in
the
child's
best
interests.
custody
decisions
are
often
difficult.
judges
must
always
strive
to
avoid
a
common
tendency
to
prefer
their
own
society
and
culture,
a
tendency
that
ought
not
to
interfere
with
objective
consideration
of
all
the
factors
that
should
be
weighed
in
determining
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
international
law
serves
a
high
purpose
when
it
underwrites
the
determination
by
nations
to
rely
upon
their
domestic
courts
to
enforce
just
laws
by
legitimate
and
fair
proceedings.
to
interpret
the
convention
to
permit
an
abducting
parent
to
avoid
a
return
remedy
even
when
the
other
parent
holds
ne
exeat
right
would
run
counter
to
the
convention's
purpose
of
deterring
child
abductions
by
parents
who
attempt
to
find
a
friendlier
forum
for
deciding
custodial
disputes.
this
court
should
be
most
reluctant
to
adopt
an
interpretation
that
gives
an
abducting
parent
an
advantage
by
coming
here
to
avoid
a
return
remedy
that
is
granted
for
instance
in
the
united
kingdom,
israel,
austria,
germany
and
south
africa.
requiring
a
return
remedy
in
cases
like
this
one
does
helps
deter
child
abductions
and
abduction
can
have
devastating
consequences
for
the
child.
child
psychologists
believe
that
the
trauma
children
suffer
from
an
abduction
is
one
of
the
worst
forms
of
child
abuse.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
thomas
and
breyer
joined.
