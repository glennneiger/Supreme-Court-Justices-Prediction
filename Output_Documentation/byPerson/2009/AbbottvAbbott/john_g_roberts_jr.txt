chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-645,
abbott
v.
abbott.
ms.
howe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
answer
you
just
gave
about
concern
for
the
protection
of
the
child,
that
applies
only
to
the
child?
in
other
words,
in
the
case
that
we
have
been
discussing,
if
the
woman
would
be
subject
to
whatever
persecution
or
domestic
violence,
but
the
child
--
you
know,
there's
no
suggestion
of
any
harm
targeted
to
the
child,
that
would
not
be
a
case
in
which
they
could
grant
refuge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
only
--
only
to
the
child?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
woman
would
be
subject
to
--
if
she
wanted
to
remain
with
the
child,
there
would
be
no
protection.
she
would
have
to
choose
between
subjecting
herself
to
violence
or
being
apart
from
the
child?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
convention,
for
the
returning
state
to
say,
we
are
returning
the
child,
but
only
if
--
you
know,
bang,
bang,
bang?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
anders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
--
so
that
if
you
have
the
mother
taking
her
daughter
from,
say,
a
country
where
she
would
be
forced
to
be
raised
under
sharia
law
and
that
--
that
is
up
to
that
country
to
decide
whether
the
child
has
to
be
returned?
or
is
there
a
basis
for
a
domestic
tribunal
in
the
court,
in
the
--
what
is
it
called,
the
country
of
refuge?
can
that
country
decide
that
the
child
should
not
be
returned?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
your
position
that,
in
that
case,
the
mother
should
return
her
daughter
to
the
country
where
she
will
be
raised
under
a
system
that
the
mother
finds
quite
offensive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
--
i
know
ms.
howe
cited
it.
what
is
the
standard
on
the
13(b)
defense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
--
does
the
status
of,
in
this
case,
women
in
the
country,
does
that
constitute
grave
risk,
or
is
it
an
individualized
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
country
is
going
to
make
a
determination
in
favor
of
their
domestic
law
and
their
domestic
system.
presumably,
they
are
not
going
to
say:
we
think
it's
a
grave
risk
to
the
child
to
be
raised
under
our
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hays.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
howe,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
a
little
taken
aback
by
your
answer
to
justice
breyer.
you
think
the
grave
prosecution
standard
means
whatever
is
the
best
interest
of
the
child?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
agree
with
what
i
understood
to
be
the
solicitor
general's
position,
that
that's
an
individual-specific
and
not
a
culture-specific
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
three
cases.
