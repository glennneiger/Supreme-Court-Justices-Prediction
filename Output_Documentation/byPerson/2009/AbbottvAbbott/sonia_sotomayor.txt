there
is
an
alternative,
isn't
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
for
the
woman
to
go
to
the
chilean
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
ms.
anders,
that's
the
point,
isn't
it?
the
purpose
of
the
convention
is
which
court
will
decide
the
life
of
that
child,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
to
avoid,
as
i
understood
the
convention
structure,
this
flight
from
court
to
court
and
this
long,
drawn-out
process
from
country
to
country
over
who's
going
to
make
that
choice,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
the
idea
is,
whether
it's
one
custody
right
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
whether
it's
one
custody
right
or
many,
which
court
is
going
to
decide
what's
in
the
best
interest
of
that
child?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
said
in
your
brief
that
this
position
by
the
solicitor
general
is
long-standing.
i'm
quoting.
what
do
we
look
to,
to
see
how
far
back
and
under
how
many
administrations
this
position
has
been
taken
and
in
what
form?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we
have
been
a
part
of
the
special
commission
since
1989,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
anything
in
the
history
of
the
negotiation
and
passage
of
the
--
of
the
treaty
that
--
that
reflects
what
the
u.s.'s
position
was
on
this
particular
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
there's
a
law
that
says
joint
custody;
mom
can
determine
the
place
to
live;
mom
can
determine
the
education
of
the
child;
dad
can
visit
when
he
wants;
dad
can
review
choices
but
not
veto
them.
but
we
consider
this
joint
custody.
under
your
view,
what
defines
custody
under
the
convention
in
a
way
that
would
justify
an
american
court
saying,
that's
not
a
custodial
right;
even
though
the
law
of
that
domestic
jurisdiction
defines
that
and
says,
that's
our
terms
of
joint
custody,
but
we
create
this
kind
of
joint
custody?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
regardless
of
what
the
terms
of
that
right
are,
so
long
as
the
domestic
law
deems
it
such,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
except
the
--
the
convention
doesn't
define
custodial
rights,
correct?
it
doesn't
give
them
meaning
except
in
one
way,
the
right
to
determine
a
place
of
residence,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
that's
a
little
tough,
because
parents
provide
care
in
so
many
different
ways.
and
weren't
the
convention
members
very
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
in
different
countries
that
has
different
meanings?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
not
the
word
they
used.
they
used
"custody
rights
including
determining
the
place
of
residence.
"
so
they
didn't
give
any
greater
meaning
to
the
word
"care"
than
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
convention
article
13
starts
at
14,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
mr.
abbott
still
in
chile?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
at
the
time
when
the
child
was
removed,
there
was
ongoing
custody
motions
before
the
court
in
chile?
