justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
imagine
a
well-educated
american
woman
marries
a
man
from
a
foreign
country
x.
they
have
a
divorce.
the
judge
says,
the
man
is
completely
at
fault
here,
a
real
rotter.
the
woman
is
100
percent
entitled
to
every
possible
bit
of
custody,
and
the
man
can
see
the
child
twice
a
year
on
christmas
day
at
4:00
in
the
morning.
that's
it.
now,
there's
a
law
like
chile's
that
says
you
can't
take
the
child
out
of
the
country
without
the
permission
of
the
father
too,
this
person
who
gets
to
see
the
child
twice
a
year.
and
you're
saying
that
that's
custody.
it's
custody,
and
--
and
what
is
the
woman
supposed
to
do?
she
can't
get
a
decent
job
worthy
of
her
education.
the
--
the
--
all
the
courts
said
that
she's
entitled
to
the
child.
she
has
to
choose
between
her
life
and
her
child.
and
--
and
is
that
what
this
--
this
convention
is
aimed
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
--
now,
of
course,
what
i'm
asking
you
with
my
example--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
why
interpret
it
that
way,
where
all
that
you
have
is
a
rule
of
law
that
applies
to
everybody,
even
in
the
case
i've
tried
to
imagine,
where
to
say
it's
a
right
of
custody
would
ruin
the
life
of
the
woman,
would
give
the
husband
something
which
he
should
--
certainly
shouldn't
have
in
any
moral
term,
it
would
seem,
and
she
comes
back
to
the
united
states
and
is
forced
to
give
her
child
back
to
whatever
this
country
is.
i
have
called
it
x.
now,
why
give
that
kind
of
interpretation
to
this
statute,
which
seems
to
have
a
purpose
that's
looking
after
women
and
children?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
your
conclusion.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
--
to
see
if
there
is
any
humane
purpose
underlying
the
interpretation
that
you
have
advocated,
and
certainly
there
are
two
interpretations
here.
your
opponents
will
soon
present
us
with
a
different
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
get
at
what
the
humane
purpose
would
be,
given
your
interpretation
of
the
law
in
this
kind
of
situation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
law
--
what
is
the
law
if
a
mother
and
a
child
--
sorry.
what's
the
law
if
a
couple
living
in
a
foreign
country
has
a
decree
of
the
court,
and
the
decree
of
the
court
grants
certain
visiting
rights
to
the
father,
and
the
father,
violating
those
rights,
takes
the
child
to
a
different
country.
can
the
mother
get
it
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
normal
law
where
you
have
a
couple
--
they're
supposed
to
leave
the
child
in
the
country,
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
there's
no
ne
exeat
thing.
they've
just
agreed
to
certain
visiting
rights.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
violation
of
those
rights,
the
father,
say,
takes
the
child
to
another
country
in
violation
of
the
divorce
decree
of
the
first
country.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
you
are
not
understanding
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is,
outside
this
convention--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
--
forget
the
convention.
suppose
there's
just
a
divorce
decree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
suppose
a
parent,
violating
the
decree,
takes
the
child
to
another
country
in
violation
of
an
ordinary
divorce
decree.
does
the
injured
parent
have
a
way
of
getting
the
child
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sure
there
isn't,
but
under
the
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
would
go
and
take
the
court's
order
to
a
court
in
the
united
states
and
try
to
enforce
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
american
court
would
be
under
obligation,
i
guess,
to
enforce
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
so
our
question
here
is
which
of
the
two
mechanisms
should
we
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
think
that,
but
i'm
still
worried
about
my
mother
in
the
case
that
--
that
you
gave
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
read
through
that,
and
i'll
tell
you
that,
on
the
basis
of
my
reading
through
all
that
stuff,
my
mind
is
in
equipoise.
i
find
some
one
way,
some
the
other.
i
think
maybe
each
side
does
a
little
overstating
here,
but
--
but
i
--
i
am
in
equipoise,
having
looked
at
that
quickly.
so
i
know
--
i
know
the
stuff,
you
can
--
but
that's
why
i
am
trying
to
get
to
the
underlying
humane
idea
that's
supposed
to
underlie
that,
and
see
if
it
applies
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
seem
to
be
thinking
of
--
this
is
--
maybe
you
can
get
at
what
is
bothering
me.
i'm
perhaps
not
articulating
it
very
well.
but
the
--
where
there's
any
kind
of
a
custody
right,
i
normally
think
there
was
a
human
being
called
a
family
law
judge
who
has
a
very
tough
job,
and
he
has
looked
at
the
situation
of
these
two
people
here
and
the
child.
and
he
said,
at
least:
smith
and
mrs.
smith,
you
are
each
going
to
have
a
little
bit,
at
least.
now,
but
in
a
situation
where
he
says
to
mr.
smith,
nothing,
i
want
to
give
you
nothing
--
he
thinks
this
is
frankenstein's
monster;
he
does
not
want
to
give
him
a
single
thing
--
that,
on
your
interpretation
of
this
statute,
that
doesn't
matter.
just
because
chile
has
a
general
law
that
says
you
can't
take
anybody
out
of
the
country
without
permission,
just
because
of
that,
even
frankenstein's
monster
is
considered
to
have
custody
for
the
purposes
of
this,
though
the
human
being
who
looked
at
this,
called
the
family
law
judge,
said:
don't
let
him
near
that
child.
all
right?
now,
that's
--
don't
pick
up
on
my
errors
in
that
i
know
i
haven't
stated
it
quite
right,
but
look
at
what
i'm
driving
at.
and
that's
what's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
there
are
ways
out,
but
why
should
we
include
custody
to
be
a
situation
where
the
human
being
who
looked
at
this
couple
thought
that
that
individual,
the
husband,
should
have
nothing
but
visit
him
occasionally
on
christmas?
why
should
we
interpret
the
word
"custody"
in
this
treaty
to
include
even
that
situation,
which
turns
the
treaty
into
a
general
"return
the
child"
no
matter
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
could
we
interpret
the
words
"great
psychological
harm"
to
include,
for
example,
a
situation
where
an
educated
woman
with
an
advanced
degree
is
unable
to
get
work
in
the
country
where
her
child
lives
and
has
to
live
under
conditions
that
are
--
that
are
really
--
we
would
say
are
fairly
primitive
because
of
her
inability
to
find
an
appropriate
employment?
can
you
include
that
under
great
psychological
harm,
so
that
the
child
wouldn't
have
to
go
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
has
there
ever
been
--
would
you
advocate
that
kind
of
very
broad
standard
of
great
psychological
--
and
what
would
be
your
position,
or
what's
the
government's
position
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
i
--
if
i
think,
as
justice
alito
was
starting
out,
that
if
the
--
a
court
order
in
the
divorce
case
says
the
father
and
mother
will
jointly
decide
what
house
to
live
in,
that
the
father
has
a
custody
right,
if
it
jointly
says
the
father
and
the
mother
will
decide
what
state
to
live
in,
that
that's
a
custody
right.
that
it
says
that
the
father
and
mother
will
decide
what
city,
same.
the
father
and
mother
will
jointly
what
country
to
live
in,
same.
but
suppose
that
there
is
no
such
decree;
rather,
the
jurisdictional
statutes
of
the
nation,
without
considering
this
family,
have
a
rule
that
says
they
have
to
live
in
chile
without
court
permission.
is
there
any
way
i
can
draw
a
line,
in
terms
of
this
statute,
between
the
two
situations,
the
one
being
where
the
divorce
judge
actually
focused
on
the
needs
and
circumstances
of
a
family,
the
other
being
where
there
was
no
more
than
a
jurisdictional
law
in
a
nation
that
tried
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
its
courts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that,
but
what
i'm
wondering
is
if
--
if
--
i
thought
you
would
agree
with
me
about
that,
and
since
i
thought
you
would
agree
with
me
about
that,
you
would
explain
to
me
how
i
could
reach
that
result,
consistent
with
the
language
of
this
convention,
which
talks
about
custody
rights
granted
by
operation
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who's
against
it?
i
--
as
i
read
their
brief,
france
is
not
on
their
side.
it's
split.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
canada
is
on
your
side;
that
the
house
of
lords
is
--
has
some
dicta
written
by
two
judges,
which
is
good,
but
it
wasn't
a
holding
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
that's
about
it,
and
so
maybe
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--germany.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
do
you
count
for
you
of
the
seven,
just
so
i
can
write
it
down
and
go
back
and
read
them?
any
one
of
the
seven
for
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
any
other
for
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
canada.
okay.
and
who's
against
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
asked
who
is
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
one
against
you,
one
for
you,
the
rest
unclear?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
old
is
the
child?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
didn't
your
client
just
ask
the
judge
there
to
leave
chile?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
read
that
exception
there
to
say
--
"grave
injury"
and
so
forth
--
can
we
read
it
as
in
essence
saying,
look,
do
what's
best
for
the
child?
