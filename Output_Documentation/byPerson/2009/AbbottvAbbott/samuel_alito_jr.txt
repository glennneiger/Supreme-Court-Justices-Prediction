justice
samuel
a.
alito,

well,
suppose
there's
a
court
order
that
prohibits
the
--
one
of
the
parents
--
the
parent
with
whom
the
child
lives
most
of
the
time
from
moving
more
than
an
hour's
drive
from
the
prior
place
of
residence,
would
that
be
--
would
--
would
the
--
the
other
parent
then
have
custody?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
court
order
says
that
the
--
that
the
child
may
not
move
from
the
house
where
the
child
lives
now.
would
that
be
custody?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what's
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
"determine
the
place
of
residence"?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
okay.
so,
if
--
it
there's
a
court
order
that
says
the
child
shall
not
move
from
123
maple
street
without
the
consent
of
both
parents,
do
both
parents
then
have
custody?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
is
more
important,
determining
the
house
in
which
the
child
is
going
to
live
or
determining
the
country
in
which
the
child
is
going
to
live?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
the
signatories
of
this
convention
have
wanted
to
regard
a
parent
as
having
custodial
rights
if
the
parent
has
the
right
to
veto
a
change
of
address
within
a
country,
but
not
when
the
parent
has
the
authority
to
veto
the
future
nationality
and
cultural
background
of
the
child?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
point
too
much,
but
maybe
you
could
just
give
me
an
example
of
a
court
order
that
you
believe
would
give
a
parent
the
right
to
determine
place
of
residence
and,
therefore,
would
constitute
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
convention.
