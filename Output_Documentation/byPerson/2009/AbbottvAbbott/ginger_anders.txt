mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ne
exeat
provision
at
issue
in
this
case
gave
petitioner
the
power
to
prevent
exactly
the
harm
that
is
the
hague
convention's
central
concern.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
agree
that
chile
has
by
law
decided
that
the
ne
exeat
right
should
arise
automatically
in
any
parent
who
has
visitation
rights.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
convention
--
the
explanatory
report
makes
clear
that
the
convention
is
designed
to
protect
all
of
the
ways
in
which
joint
custody
can
arise
and
be
awarded
under
domestic
law.
and
i
think
we
have
a
variety
of
situations
in
every
country
in
which
joint
custodial
rights
arise
automatically.
for
instance,
in
the
united
states,
when
two
parents
are
married
and
separated,
and
there
has
been
no
custody
order
yet,
we
would
say
that
both
of
those
parents
have
automatic
joint
custody
rights
in
the
child.
in
civil
law
countries,
there
are
a
variety
of
automatic
joint
custodial
decision-making--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--it
would
not
be
a
different
case,
because
the
convention
protects
rights
of
custody,
and
it
specifies
that
those
rights
can
be
awarded
jointly.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
the
mother
may
have
most
of
the
custodial
rights,
what
we
would
think
of
as
physical
custody,
but
the
convention
protects
rights
of
custody.
and
i
think
what's
particularly
important
is
that
it
separates
out
the
right
to
determine
residence
as
the
most
important
custody
right
with
which
it
is
concerned.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
chile
could
have
made
a
determination
as
a
matter
of
its
domestic
law,
that
it
would
be
in
the
child's
interest--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
the
convention's
fundamental
principles
actually
are
in
line
with
your
concerns,
because
what
the
convention
says
is
that
anytime
that
the
child
has
been
abducted
in
violation
of
a
decision-making
right
that
the
--
that
one
or
the
other
parent
has,
then
the
child
should
be
returned.
but
the
return
remedy
is
not
a
determination
that
the
child
should
live
with
the
left-behind
parent
or
that
he
should
live
out
the
rest
of
his
life
in
chile.
it's
simply
a
determination
that
the
courts
of
the
country
of
habitual
residence
should
decide
what
should
happen
with
the
child
going
forward.
that's
the
fundamental
premise
in
it.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
right.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
exactly
right,
and
i
think
the
ne
exeat
right
is
very--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--there
are
narrow
defenses
to
return,
and
one
of
those
is
the
grave
risk
defense
in
article
13(b).
there's
also
a
fundamental
principles
defense
in
article
20.
but,
fundamentally,
i
think
the
convention
is
premised
on
the
idea
that
the
courts
of
the
various
states
parties
will
be
well-placed
to
determine
the
custody--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
that
would
not
necessarily
be
the
case.
presumably,
that
mother
could
raise
the
13(b)
defense
or
the
article
20
defense
to
return,
and--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--it
says,
"a
grave
risk
that
the
return
would
expose
the
child
to
physical
or
psychological
harm.
"
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
it
would
generally
be
an
individualized
determination.
but
i
think
the
convention
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
wherever
--
wherever
the
parent
started
out,
wherever
their
custody
determinations
are
being
made
to
begin
with,
that
is
the
country
that
should
continue
in
the
normal
situation
to
determine
what
should
be
in
the
interest--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
it
would
be
the
--
it
would
be
the
courts
in
the
country
of
residence
that
would
be
making
that
determination.
but
i
think
the
question
of
which
court
might
have
a
more
favorable
determination,
that
--
that
kind
of
forum-shopping
is
precisely
what
the
convention
was
trying
to
prevent.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
--
i
presume
that
you
could,
in
an
individual
case,
offer
evidence
that
might
include
things
like--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--it's
that
the
defense
would
be
more
narrow
than
that.
but
that's
because,
first,
the
convention
is
based
on
the
idea
that
--
that
the
courts
of
the
country
of
habitual
residence
can
make
this
determination
in
the
child's
best
interest,
and
that
they
should
be
the
ones
to
do
that
--
we
shouldn't
allow
forum-shopping
--
and
also
because
the
return
remedy
is
not
a
determination
that
the
child
will
have
to
stay
in
the
country
for
the
rest
of
his
life
or
even
that
the
mother
would
necessarily
have
to
return
with
him.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
correct.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
it
might
be
relevant
evidence--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--right.
right.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
it's
certainly
the
position
as
memorialized
in
our
brief
here.
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
memorialized
it
in
writing
prior
to
this
brief,
but
this
court
has
in
the
past
looked
to
the
government's
position
as
memorialized
in
an
amicus
brief
in
this
court.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
correct.
and
in
the
first
special
commission
meeting
in
1989
and
then
again
in
1993,
this
issue
was
on
the
agenda,
and
the
united
states
joined
the
consensus
of
the
states
parties
that
a
ne
exeat
right
should
be
considered
a
custody
right
under
the
convention.
and
so--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--not
on
this
particular
issue
specifically,
but
this
has
been
our
position
as
--
as
expressed
in
the
special
commission
meetings
and
the
reports
to--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
believe
the
state
department's
legal
analysis
stated
that
the
typical
case
might
be
one
in
which
a
parent
with
--
with
primary
physical
custody
had
the
child,
but
the
visiting
--
the
parent
with
visitation
rights
took
the
child
to
another
country.
but
the
fact
that
it
was
a
typical
case
means
that
it
wasn't
the
only
type
of
case,
and
as
--
as
family
law
has
developed
over
the
past
30
years,
joint
rights
of
custody
have
become
more
and
more
prevalent,
and
we,
therefore,
think
that
this
is
a
joint
right
to
determine
residence
under
the
convention,
because
it
gives
the
father
the
right
to
withhold
or
grant
consent
to
the
child's
removal
from
the
country.
