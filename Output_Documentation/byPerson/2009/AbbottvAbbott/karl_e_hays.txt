mr.
karl
e.
hays
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rights
of
custody
and
rights
of
access
are
very
different
and
distinct
substantive
rights.
the
hague
convention
makes
a
distinction
between
those
two
sets
of
rights
and
provides
the
automatic
return
remedy
only
in
those
situations
where
there
has
been
a
breach
of
a
right
of
custody.
what
mr.
abbott
is
seeking
in
this
case
is
to
have
the
court
define
a
bright-line
rule,
saying
that
in
any
instance
where
there
is
a
statute
or
a
provision
which
limits
the
rights
of
the
custodial
parent
to
remove
a
child
outside
of
--
of
the
particular
jurisdiction,
that
any
time
there
is
a
statute
or
ordinance
or
order
to
that
effect,
that
you
confer
rights
of
custody
upon
an
individual
who
would
otherwise
only
have
rights
of
access.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
the
mother
did
not
have
the
right
to
take
the
child
out
of
the
country
without
either
obtaining
the
permission
of
the
father
or
obtaining
permission
of
the
court
to
do
that.
that
was
a
limitation
on
her
exercise
of
custodial
rights.
it
did
not,
in
and
of
itself,
grant
a
right
to
the
father.
the
father
was
not
granted
a
custodial
right.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
in
--
in
that
situation,
the
--
the
rights
are
created
under
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction,
and
that
--
and
that
--
in
that
instance,
it
would
be
a
joint
custodial
right.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
right.
but
in
this
instance
the
chilean
courts
have
not
created
a
joint
custodial
right
within
the
common--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--no,
your
honor.
what
happens
is
the
--
the
convention
contains
an
understanding
of
what
the
parties
at
the
time
of
the
drafting
of
the
convention
understood
custodial
rights
to
entail.
the
focus
of
the
convention
was
on
maintaining
the
relationship
between
the
parent
that
was
providing
care.
and
so
the
members
of
the
convention--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--they
were.
but
they
understood
that
there
was
a
commonly
accepted
understanding
of
custody
in
terms
of
the
party
who
had
care
for
the
child.
and
that
was--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--the
--
the
exact
definition
from
article
5
is
"rights
of
custody
shall
include
rights
relating
to
the
care
of
the
person
of
the
child.
"
and
then
they
said,
"and
in
particular,
the
right
to
determine
the
child's
place
of
residence.
"
mr.
karl
e.
hays
no.
here
again,
that
is
--
that
is
simply
a
restriction
placed
upon
that
parent's
right
to
exercise
custody.
it
is
--
it
is--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--again,
that
is
--
that
is
simply
a
restriction
on
that
parent's
right
to
exercise
their
--
their
custodial
authority.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
"determine
the
place
of
residence"
was
--
was
placed
into
the
convention
because
that
ordinarily
is
a
right
of
custody.
a
parent
who
ordinarily
has
the
care
of
the
child
has
the
child
with
them.
and
i
would
hazard
a
guess
that
if
you
were
to
ask
anyone
in
this
courtroom
what
their
residence
was,
they
would
tell
you
that
their
residence
is
123
maple
street,
that
it
doesn't
entail
the
determination
of
the
actual
country--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--in
--
in
that
instance,
there
may
be
a
--
a
joint
right
regarding
the
--
the
determination
of
the
residence,
which
is
not
what
we
have
in
--
which
is
not
what
we
have
in
this
case.
but
here
again,
it
is
--
it
is
more
in
keeping
with
simply
putting
a
restriction
upon
the
parents
who
--
the
parent
who
has
the
right
of
custody,
their
right
to
exercise
that.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
it's
important
to
understand
here
that
--
that
he
does
not
have
a
--
a
right
under
the
chilean
statute.
if--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--the
--
the
statute
says,
first
of
all,
that
if
you
--
you
have
the
consent
of
the
parent,
but
if
you
don't
get
the
consent
of
the
parent,
you
go
--
you
go
to
the
court.
so
it
is--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--it's
actually
not
--
it
--
and
that's
--
and
that's
the
position
that
mr.
abbott
wants
this
court
to
--
to
take,
is
that,
well,
it's
a
right,
and
since
it's
not
a
right
of
access,
it
has
to
be
a
right
of
custody.
it's
--
it's
actually
not
a
substantive
right.
it
is
a
means
of
doing
two
things,
which
is
what
the
united
states
recognized
at
the
time
of
the
drafting
of
the
convention.
it
is
a
means
of
preserving
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
it
is
also
a
means
of
enforcing
access
rights.
it's
a
procedural
right;
it
is
not
a
substantive
right.
and
the
--
the
hague
convention
clearly
makes
a
distinction
between
substantive
rights
of
custody
and
substantive
rights
of
access.
but
what
--
what
the
--
mr.
abbott
wants--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--actually,
your
honor,
what
the
--
what
the
convention
does
is
not
specifically
define
either
term.
the
--
the
terminology
is
--
is
it
includes
these
particular
rights,
because
they
didn't
want
to
get
specific
as
to
what
exactly
rights
of
custody
entailed,
what
exactly
rights
of
access
entailed.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
that
was
not
the
understanding
of
the
--
of
the
drafters
of
the
convention,
because
--
and--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--textually,
when
--
when
you
examine
article
--
when
you
examine
article
5
in
conjunction
with
article
3
and
article
13,
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
follow,
because
article
3
and
article
13
both
provide
that
the
rights
had
to
be
actually
exercised.
and
when
you
--
you
read
the
p√©rez-vera
report,
which
is
analyzing
both
of
those
sections,
it
--
it's
clear
that
the
intent
of
the
drafters
at
the
time
was
that
you
had
to
have
actual
physical
care
of
the
child,
because
the
purpose
of
this
--
of
this
convention
was
to
prevent
the
situation
that
this
court
has
already
discussed,
and
that
is,
a
parent
who
has
custodial
rights,
full
custody
of
a
child
--
the
other
parent
kidnaps
the
child
and
takes
them
to
another
country
in
order
to
seek
a
--
another
court
order.
in
this
case,
you
don't
have
that
situation.
chile
already
determined
that
mrs.
abbott
had
full
custody
of
her
child.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
absolutely
not.
she
could
decide
wherever
she
wanted
to
live
in
chile
under
the
court
order
that
she
was
given.
she
had
full
control
over
deciding
where
--
where
her
son
was
to
live--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--that's
correct.
that
she
had
to
first
get
either
his
permission
or
go
to
court
and
get
permission
of
the
--
of
the
court.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
absolutely.
she
--
she
had
the
absolute
right
to
decide
all
issues
with
respect
to
her
son.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
for
purposes
of
the
convention,
determining
the
house
where
--
where
the
child
lives,
determining
the
issues
relating
to
the
care
of
the
child,
because
that
was
what
the
convention
was
intended
to
protect,
that
relationship,
because
you
were
having
situations
where
a
parent
who
had
a
custodial
relationship
with
the
child
would
have
that
relationship
severed
by
the
other
parent
taking
the
child,
going
to
another
country,
and
then
seeking
a
court
order.
and
there
is
one
thing
that
i
think
needs
to
be
corrected
here.
when
mrs.
abbott
went
to
texas,
she
did
not
attempt
to
obtain
a
court
order
that
would
have
stripped
mr.
abbott
of
his
rights.
in
fact,
in
texas
the
presumption
is
joint
managing
conservatorship.
and
she
asked
for
sole
managing
conservatorship,
which
would
have
been
the
equivalent
of
what
she
was
granted
under
chilean
law.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
they
very
well
may
not
have
intended
either
of
those
instances
to
create
a
--
a
joint
right
of
--
of
custody.
at
the
point
in
time
when
the
convention
was
being
drafted,
joint
custodial
rights
were
--
were
basically
a
new
concept,
and
there
were
--
there
was
not
a
lot
of
experience
in
the
exercise
of
joint
--
of
joint
custodial
rights.
the
--
the
focus
of
the
convention
was
ensuring
that
the
parent
who
had
the
primary
relationship
with
--
with
the
child,
that
that
relationship
would
not
be
severed
by
someone
taking
a
child
out
of
--
of
the
country.
and
that
was
the
focus
of
--
of
the
convention,
which
is
why
there
was
a
distinct
difference
drawn
between
protecting
rights
of
access
and
protecting
rights
of
--
rights
of
custody.
rights
of
access
were
given
different
protection
mechanisms
under
--
under
the
convention,
as
opposed
to
the
mandatory
return
that
was
--
that
was
envisioned
by
rights
--
by--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--typically
--
typically
in
--
in
texas,
texas
adheres
to
a
position
of
joint
managing
conservatorship.
the
presumption
in
texas
is
that
both
parents
have
equal
ability
to
make
decisions
regarding
their
child.
and
so
the
courts
will
routinely
enter
orders
to
say
both
parents
get
to
decide
education,
both
parents
get
to
decide
medical
issues.
even
in
that
instance,
though,
the
court
will
attribute
the
right
to
determine
the
primary
residence
of
the
child
to
one
parent
or
the
other,
and
will
impose
a
--
a
restriction
on
the
exercise
of
that
right.
they
will
impose
a
geographical
restriction
and
say,
you
can
establish
residence
only
in
this
county
or
--
or
contiguous
counties.
that's
in
the
nature,
though,
of
a
--
of
a
joint
managing
conservatorship
or
joint
custody
situation.
what
we
have
in
this
case,
though,
is
an
instance
where
all
of
the
custodial
rights,
all
of
the
decisionmaking
authority
was
given
solely
to
the
mother.
the--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--actually,
your
honor,
that
--
that
statement
in
the
briefs
is
a
--
is
a
misstatement
of
what
happened
in
the
beaumont
case.
in
duran
v.
beaumont,
there
are
--
there
are
distinctions
that
have
not
been
made
by
--
by
mr.
abbott.
most
importantly,
there
was
no
court
order
in
that
case.
and,
when
there
is
no
court
order,
under
chilean
law,
it
is
a
situation
where
there
is
joint
custody
as
a
matter
of
law.
secondly,
the
actual
affidavit
--
and
the
language
of
the
affidavit
is
quoted
in
the
dissent
to
that
case.
the
actual
affidavit
states
both
parents
have
the
guard
and
custody
of
their
daughter,
and
the
decisions
of
major
importance
must
be
adopted
by
both
parents.
so,
clearly,
the
chilean
authority
was
referencing
in
their
--
in
their
affidavits
they
provided
in
that
case,
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
joint
custody
situation.
and
they
--
they
didn't
decide
it
solely
on
the
basis
of
--
that
this
ne
exeat
statute
created
a
right
of
custody.
also--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--the
wording
--
the
wording
of
--
of
the
sentence,
it
includes
the
statute.
it's
like
the
statute,
comma,
the
guard
and
custody,
and
also
decisions
of
major
importance.
it's
--
it's
a
number
of
things.
it's
not
just
singled
out
the
way
that
mr.
abbott
has
--
has
presented
it
to
the
court.
they
don't
make
a
statement
saying,
this
statute
equates
to
rights
of
custody.
it's
a
situation
where
they
say,
you
take
all
of
this
together,
the
fact
that
they
had
the
guard
and
custody
of
their
daughter
and
the
decisions
of
major
importance
must
be
adopted
by
both
parents
--
you
take
all
of
that
together
as
the
finding
of
the
chilean
authority
that,
in
fact,
the
parent
in
that
case
had
joint
decisions
and
had
--
had
rights
of
custody
that
were
being
breached.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
the
purpose
of
the
convention
was
--
was
not
focused
on
protecting
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--our
position
is
that
this
does
not
give
any
sort
of
affirmative
right
to
the
father,
and
it
is
not
a
right
to
determine
because,
if
you
take
the
common
usage
of
the
right
to
determine,
it
is
to
make
an
affirmative
decision,
and--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--actually,
your
honor,
the
united
states
and
canada
do,
and
the
analysis
that
we--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--the
--
the
united
states
and
canada
--
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
and
i
believe
that
it's
pointed
out
in
other
amicus
briefs,
the
--
there
have
only
been
seven
courts
of
last
resort
that
have
heard
this
issue.
there
are
some
81
countries
that
belong
to
the
hague
convention.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
if,
in
fact,
there
were
a
--
a
consensus,
but
there
--
there
is
not
a
consensus
in
this
instance
because
we
--
as
we
analyze
in
our
brief
and
i
believe
the
11
law
professors
analyzed
in
their
brief,
you
cannot
get
a
clear
consensus
of
what--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--correct.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
correct.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
that
was
--
there
--
there
have
been
--
that
is
one
instance.
however,
you
also
have
the
situation
of
the
--
the
canadian
opinions
which
are
well-reasoned
opinions--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--which,
actually,
even
though
--
even
though
they
did
not
return
the
child
based
on
the
--
on
the
ground,
they
still
made
the
--
the
decision,
and
the
second
case
that
followed--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--well,
the
german
constitutional
court
in
that
instance,
their
specific
reference
in
the
case
itself
to
the
fact
that
this
involves
also
joint
custody
rights,
as
do
--
as
do
a
number
of
the
other
foreign
--
of
the
other
foreign
cases.
ireland,
also,
is
one
that
is
cited
by
mr.
abbott,
and
that
one
involved
a
situation
of
joint
parental
responsibility.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
yes,
the--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--the
circuit
courts
in
the
united
states--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--and
canada.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
the
--
well,
france
is
divided.
france
has--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--against
us,
it's
--
other
than
--
other
than
the
dicta
that
--
that's
pointed
out
in
the
english
opinions,
we
take
the
position
that
the
other
ones,
it's
unclear
as
to
--
as
to
how
you--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--unclear,
because--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--yes.
i
--
the
--
the
australian
case
dealt,
again,
with
a
--
with
a
joint
custody
situation,
and
in
--
in
that
particular
case,
i
believe
--
if
i
am
correct
in
my
recollection
of
it
--
the
australian
court
expressed
some
reservation
about
making
a
bright-line
rule
that
these
type
of
ne
exeat
clauses
actually
established--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--the
--
the
point
that
we
are
making,
however,
is
that,
if
you
have
a
--
one
or
two
or
even
three
countries
that
have
gone
one
way
and
then
you
have
other
countries
that
have
gone
the
other
way,
that
there's
not
a
clear-cut
overwhelming
majority
of
the
other
jurisdictions
that
have
ruled
in
favor
of
establishing
ne
exeat
orders,
and--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--there
--
there
is
a
possibility
of
--
of
that.
there
is
also
a
possibility
under
the
--
there
was
a
question
as
to
--
the
--
what
--
what
remedies
could
--
could
be
used.
there
are
--
there
are
--
under
the
hague
convention,
article
21
provides
remedies
for
access
rights,
which
is
what
mr.
abbott
has.
also,
as
was
recognized
by
the
state
department,
when
they
sent
their
--
when
they
sent
their
analysis
to
the
senate
in
favor
of
ratification,
the
state
department
recognized
that
there
are
mechanisms
within
the
united
states
to
enforce
these
orders,
namely
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
and
enforcement
act
that
mr.
abbott
could
avail
himself
of.
and
mr.
abbott,
in
fact,
did
file
an
action
in
texas
to
enforce
his
visitation
rights.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
if
they--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--these--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--now,
the
--
the
--
a
violation
of
the
ne
exeat
provision
could
be
enforced,
but
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
means
of
enforcing
the
ne
exeat
provision
falls
under
the
auspices
of
the
hague
convention.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
absolutely.
under
texas
law,
a
child
that
reaches
the
age
of
12
--
the
court
is
entitled
to
consider
that
child's
--
that
child's
desires.
and
under--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--that,
also,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
the
--
one
of--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--that
--
no,
it's
a
specific
provision
of
the
treaty,
your
honor.
under
article
13,
the
court
--
the
court
that
is
deciding
whether
to
return
the
child
has
the
discretion
not
to
return
the
child
if
the
child
is
of
sufficient
age
for
the
court
to
take
the
wishes
into
account
and
the
child
doesn't
want
to
go
back--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--it
--
yes,
it
is
a
defense
to
a
removal--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--the
child
is
14
and
half
right
now.
and
the--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--the
--
the
convention
article
does
not
specify
the
age.
it
leaves
it
up
to
--
to
the
determination
of
--
of
the
particular
jurisdiction
in
which
the
case
is
--
is
tried.
however,
because
this
is
in
texas,
the
--
the
texas
statutes
provide
that
you
begin
to
take
a
child's--
mr.
karl
e.
hays
--mr.
abbott's
still
living
in
chile,
yes.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
actually,
that's
incorrect,
your
honor.
there
was
not
a
custody
proceeding
in
--
in
chile
at
the
time.
there
were
three
proceedings
going
on.
there
was
a
protective
order
proceeding.
there
was
a
request
by
mr.
abbott
to
increase
his
visitation
rights,
his
rights
of
access.
and
then
there
was
a
child
support
action
where
my
client
was
attempting
to
get
some
$23,000
in
past-due
child
support.
those
were
the
actions
that
were
pending.
there
was
no
attempt
at
that
time
by
mr.
abbott
to
change
custody.
just
as
i
was
saying,
there
was
no
attempt
by
my
client
to
change
custody
when
she
moved
to
texas.
mr.
karl
e.
hays
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
if
there's
no
further
questions--
