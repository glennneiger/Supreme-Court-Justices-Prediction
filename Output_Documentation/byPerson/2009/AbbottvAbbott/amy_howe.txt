ms.
amy
howe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
hague
convention
exists
to
ensure
that
custody
disputes
are
resolved
by
the
courts
of
the
country
of
habitual
residence
rather
than
through
abduction.
it
thus
generally
requires
the
return
of
a
child
who
is
abducted
in
violation
of
a
right
of
custody.
so
too,
a
ne
exeat
right
permits
a
parent
to
require
that
the
child
reside
in
the
country
of
habitual
residence,
thereby
rendering
international
abduction
illegal.
ne
exeat
rights
are
not
only
rights
of
custody
under
the
text
of
the
convention,
but
they
also
track
the
convention's
vital
purpose
of
ensuring
that
children
are
not
subject
to
international
abduction.
under
the
convention,
mrs.
abbott
cannot
evade
the
jurisdiction
of
the
chilean
courts
by
abducting
the
child
to
texas
and
then
asking
a
texas
state
court
to
nullify
the
rights
granted
to
mr.
abbott
under
chilean
law.
that's
the
sound
view
of
the
great
majority
of
signatory
courts
to
consider
the
issue
as
well
as
essential
authorities
in
both
the
united
states
and
chile.
ms.
amy
howe
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
mr.
abbott
has
a
statutory
ne
exeat
right
as
well.
the
fact
that
he
also
has
this
right
under
the
order
is
irrelevant,
we
believe,
because
no
one
is
arguing
for
--
that
--
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
has
rights
of
custody
under
chilean
law,
and
it's
chilean
law
that
confers
the
ne
exeat
right.
the
fact
that
he
also
has
this
right
under
the
order
is
--
is
irrelevant
for
this
case.
if
mrs.
abbott--
ms.
amy
howe
--we
are
relying
just
on
the
statute.
ms.
amy
howe
it
would
be
a
right
of
custody,
justice
breyer,
that
the
convention
doesn't
look
to
the
purpose.
all
it
looks--
ms.
amy
howe
--yes.
ms.
amy
howe
certainly.
the
--
the
statute
that
you
hypothesize
in
this
case,
justice
breyer,
reflects
the
domestic
country's
judgment
that
the
child
should
remain
in
the
country,
unless
the
father
agrees
to
its
departure.
we
don't
look
to
why
the
child's
--
why
the--
ms.
amy
howe
--certainly
--
i
mean--
ms.
amy
howe
--there
is
an
alternative.
i
mean,
certainly
under
chilean--
ms.
amy
howe
--exactly,
justice
sotomayor.
under
chilean
law
and
presumably
under
the
law
that
you've
hypothesized
as
well,
justice
breyer,
the
woman
could
go
to
court
and
ask
for
permission
to
leave
the
country,
and
that's
precisely
what
mrs.
abbott
could
have
done
in
this
case.
she
just
never
opted
to
do
that.
ms.
amy
howe
okay.
ms.
amy
howe
well,
the
right
to
determine
whether
your
child
will
remain
in
the
country
or
go
to
another
country
is
a
very
important
right,
and
it's
simply
that
that's
the
--
if
that's
the
law
that
the
--
that
the
country
has
decided
to
establish,
the
convention
doesn't
look
to
why
that
is.
and
the
drafters
expressly
envisioned,
justice
breyer,
that
there
would
be
cases
in
which
one
parent
would
have
physical
custody
of
the
child,
the
other
parent
would
simply
have
the
right
to
determine
the
child's
place
of
residence.
ms.
amy
howe
well,
that,
again,
simply
reflects
that
country's
judgment.
ms.
amy
howe
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
there
may
be
a
presumption.
we
have
researched,
and
we
don't
believe
that
that's
actually
particularly
common,
justice
breyer.
but
certainly
in
many
countries,
there's
now
a
presumption
of
joint
custody.
and
so,
in
all
of
those
cases,
under
the
convention,
the
left-behind
parent
would
be
entitled
to
the
child's
return.
and
the
convention,
again,
doesn't
look
to
the
purpose.
it
doesn't
look
to
--
there's
nothing
in
the
convention,
certainly,
that
requires
that
there
be
one
category
of
parents
who
have
rights
of
custody
and
are
entitled
to
the
return
and
another
category
of
parents
who
are
not
entitled
to
the
return
remedy.
there's
a
--
there's
a
system
of
mutual
trust
under
the
convention
and--
ms.
amy
howe
--two
things,
please,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
that
that
could
happen
in
any
case,
not
simply
a
case
involving
a
ne
exeat
right,
but
also
a
case
in
which
the
left-behind
parent
had
joint
custody,
and
so
to
a
--
the
second
is
that
the
convention
--
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
no
--
no,
justice
ginsburg.
article
13(b)
of
the
convention
provides
an
affirmative
defense
to
--
to
return
if
the
court
in
the
country
of
refuge
determines
that
the
child
would
face
either
a
grave
risk
of
physical
or
psychological
harm
or
otherwise
face
an
intolerable
situation.
ms.
amy
howe
article
13(b)
has
not
previously
been
raised
in
this
case,
but
in
any
event,
regardless,
if
this
court
were
to
rule
in
our
favor,
then
the
appropriate
course
would
be
to
remand
for
resolution
of
any
remaining
issues,
yes,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
amy
howe
the
--
the
statute
does
--
the
text
does
apply
to
the
grave
risk
of
physical
or
psychological
harm
to
the
child,
and
certainly--
ms.
amy
howe
--only
to
the
child,
although
arguably
there
would
be
some
risk
of
psychological
harm
if
what
the
woman's
allegation--
ms.
amy
howe
--well,
the
courts
could
also,
of
course,
chief
justice
roberts,
try,
you
know,
to
solve
the
problem
through
undertakings
and
placing
conditions
on
the
child's
return,
if
the
--
if
the
article
13(b)
were
not
fully
able
to
address
the
court's
concerns.
if
the
court--
ms.
amy
howe
--well,
in
other
contexts,
for
example
in
the
context
of
visas,
yes.
the
special
commission
meetings,
when
this
issue
has
come
up,
has
specifically
urged
the
court
--
or
urged
courts
to
consider
undertakings
and
also
to
consider
intergovernmental
negotiations
in
an
attempt
to
ensure
both
the
mother
and
the
child's
safe
return,
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
i'm
sorry.
could
you--
ms.
amy
howe
--yes.
ms.
amy
howe
if
the
mother
had
rights
of
custody,
then
those
rights
of
custody
would
be
breached
by
the--
ms.
amy
howe
--okay.
i
apologize,
justice
breyer.
ms.
amy
howe
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
there's
no
international
--
other
international
remedy.
in
the
united
states,
for
example--
ms.
amy
howe
--there
could
be,
for
example,
the
uccjea
in
the
united
states.
you
could
go
to
court
with
an
international
order
and
attempt
to
seek
the
child's
return
in
that
manner,
yes.
you
would
attempt
to
seek
enforcement
of
the
court's
order
in
the
united
states.
ms.
amy
howe
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
in
theory,
yes.
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
we
should
use
this
convention,
justice
breyer--
ms.
amy
howe
--one
thing
that
--
that
may
give
you
some
comfort,
as
far
as
the
convention's
drafters
are
concerned,
is
that
this
was
a
scenario
that
the
convention's
drafters
had
in
mind
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
drafting
process.
they
had
five
scenarios
that
they--
ms.
amy
howe
--okay.
the
--
the
convention
was
drafted
on
the
premise
that
the
best
interests
of
children
are
served
by
their
return
to
the
country
of
habitual
residence,
so
that
the
courts
in
that
country
can
make
the
decisions.
the
convention--
ms.
amy
howe
--that's
right.
they
were
--
they
were
not
enforcing
foreign
court
orders,
and
it's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
as
you
say,
that
the
sort
of
prototypical
case
that
was
present
when
they
drafted
the
convention
was
that
one
parent,
usually
the
mother,
would
have
sole
physical
custody
and
the
father
would
have
just
visitation,
and
it
was
intended
to
address
that
problem.
but
at
the
time
that
they
drafted
the
convention,
they
also
had
in
mind
the
increasing
prevalence
of
joint
custody
and
included
that
in
the
convention.
and
they
also
recognized,
as
i
said,
that
there
would
be
scenarios
in
which
one
parent
would
have
what
we'd
consider
to
be
physical
custody
of
the
child;
the
other
parent
would
have
other
rights,
such
as
the
right
to
determine
the
child's
place
of
residence.
and
they
did
intend
for
the
parent
who
did
not
have
physical
custody
but
had
other
important
rights
relating
to
the
child,
such
as
the
right
to
determine
the
child's
place
of
residence,
to
be--
ms.
amy
howe
--it's
true.
but
again,
justice
ginsburg,
you
don't
look
at
why
the
country
attributed
those
particular
rights.
you
just
look
at
whether
the
parent
has
those
rights.
and
i
think
it's
helpful
to
think
of
the
chilean
system,
in
effect,
as
a
--
as
a
form
of
joint
custody,
just
as
some
countries
have
a
presumption
of
what
we
would
regard
as
joint
custody.
ms.
amy
howe
we
believe
that
the
chilean
system
is
analogous
to
joint
custody.
there's
a
presumption
that
--
but
it--
ms.
amy
howe
--but--
ms.
amy
howe
--no.
we
are
arguing
that
the
ne
exeat
right
is
a
right
of
custody
under
the
text
of
the
convention.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
ms.
amy
howe
--if
the
parent
has
visitation
rights,
then
yes.
that's
simply
the
way
that
chile
has
opted
to
do
it.
ms.
amy
howe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
child
support,
there
was
an
ordinary
dispute
over
the
amount
of
child
support
that's
not
addressed
in
the
record
and
which
was
finally
resolved
and
which
mr.
abbott
paid.
the
question
of
criminal
charges
--
we
are
not
aware
on
any
charges
pending
in
chile.
mr.
abbott
has
no
intent
to
bring
such
charges
if
mr.
abbott
--
if
mrs.
abbott
returns
to
chile.
and
with
regard
to
article
13
and
the
question
about
the
child's
age,
article
13
is
discretionary
rather
than
mandatory,
so
all
that
the
court
in
the
united
states
would
be
doing
would
be
to
send
the
child
back
so
that
the
courts
there
could
resolve
the
dispute.
turning
to
the
--
the
issues
about
--
the
question
of
both
"determining"
and
"the
place
of
residence".
as,
justice
alito,
you
alluded,
this
is
an
international
convention.
the
convention
doesn't
care
if
mrs.
abbott
moved
with
the
child
from
one
address
in
chile
to
another.
the
convention
cares
very
much
when
a
child
is
abducted
from
one
country
to
another.
and
as
regards
the
definition
of
residence,
it's
not
defined
in
article
5(a),
but
it
also
appears
in
article
5(b),
which
refers
to
rights
of
access.
it
refers
to
the
right
to
take
the
child
to
a
place
other
than
the
child's
habitual
residence.
and
the
drafting
history
on
this
point
makes
quite
clear
that
this
refers
not
only
to
the
right
to
take
--
take
the
child
from
the
home,
but
to
the
right
to
take
the
child
out
of
the
country.
in
the
convention
context,
the
word
mrs.
abbott
would
attribute
to
it.
the
convention
contemplates
that
rights
will
be
held
jointly
and
requires
parents
to
work
collaboratively.
so
in
this
case,
the
abbotts,
by
virtue
of
the
ne
exeat
right,
by
virtue
of
the
ne
exeat
statute,
had
a
shared,
enforceable
right
to
determine
whether
their
child
would
remain
in
chile
or
would
move
somewhere
else.
and
despite
what
mr.
hays
has
argued
and
has
argued
in
his
brief,
it
is
a
substantive
right.
the
parent
who
holds
the
right
has
the
right
to
ensure
that
his
child
remains
in
the
country
of
habitual
residence,
which
has
huge
implications
for
the
language
and
culture
in
which
the
child
will
be
raised,
and
it
ensures
that
the
courts
of
chile
can
resolve
any
disputes
relating
to
the
child.
it's
certainly
not
a
mere
enforcement
mechanism
for
mr.
abbott's
access
right.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
abbott
needed
to
have
care
and
control
of
the
child
to
invoke
rights
of
custody,
article
5(a)
of
the
convention
is
what
defines
rights
of
custody.
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
that
statute
that
requires
the
person
invoking
the
convention
to
have
physical
care
of
the
child.
ms.
amy
howe
that
--
you
could
read
that
as
a
form
of
a
best
interests
of
the
child
standard.
i
believe
that
we
would
regard
it
as
a
little
bit
narrower
and
a
grave
risk
of
harm
to
the
child
or
otherwise
place
the
child
in
an
intolerable
situation.
but
it
is
a
form
of
the
best
interest
standard,
certainly.
ms.
amy
howe
we
do
agree,
yes.
ms.
amy
howe
no,
i
believe
it's
a
stricter
standard
than
simply
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
it's
the
--
you
know,
it's
a
--
i
believe
it
speaks
for
itself.
it
is
a
grave
risk
of
psychological
harm
to
the
child.
the
convention--
ms.
amy
howe
--yes,
we
do.
article
13
is
simply
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
--
once
a
judge
has
found
that
rights
of
custody
exist
and
have
been
breached.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
convention
that
reflects
any
intent
by
the
drafters
to
narrow
the
meaning
of
13.
and
finally,
mr.
hays
cannot
point
to
anything
other
than
a
single
french
trial
court
decision
that
holds
squarely
in
his
favor,
and
when
that
trial
court
decision
was
raised
at
the
1993
special
commission
meeting,
it
garnered
no
support
from
the
delegates.
