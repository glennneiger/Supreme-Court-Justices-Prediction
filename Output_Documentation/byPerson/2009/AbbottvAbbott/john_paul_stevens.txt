justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
argument
really
boil
down
to
the
claim
that
this
was,
in
effect,
joint
custody?
it
seems
to
me
it
clearly
was
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
say
it's
not,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
--
but
are
you
arguing
that
this
--
that
this
case
is
--
is
the
equivalent
of
a
joint
custody
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
a
distinction
between
the
--
what's
before
us
in
this
case
and
the
different
case
in
which
the
order
specifically
said
custody
shall
be
joint?
the
same
--
would
that
not
be
a
different
case,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
decree
says
that
custody
--
the
mother
is
the
one
who
has
custody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hays--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
question
about
the
term
"place"
--
"place
of
residence"?
putting
aside
the
control
of
the
ne
exeat
that
would
prevent
her
from
leaving
the
country,
just
looking
at
the
situation
within
chile,
what
--
did
she
have
any
limitation
on
her
right
to
pick
that
place
of
residence
within
chile?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
only
control
that
the
--
the
husband
had
was
the
right
--
whatever
right
was
given
by
the
ne
exeat
provision,
that
you
can't
take
the
child
out
of
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
if
there
had
been
no
fight
of
the
kind
that
developed,
she
would
have
had
a
unrestricted
right
to
pick
the
place
of
residence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
general
question?
is
there
any
danger
that
the
child
is
old
enough
to
make
the
decision
now,
and,
therefore,
the
cases
are
really
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
no
matter
what
we
do,
the
child
may
actually
provide
the
answer
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent,
putting
aside
removing
the
child
from
the
country,
that
within
chile
itself
the
custodial
parent
had
the
full
right
to
determine
the
place
of
residence?
