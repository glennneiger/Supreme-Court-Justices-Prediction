justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
be
on
absolutely
sound
ground
if
this
were
a
convention
on
the
mutual
recognition
of
jurisdiction
and
judgment,
but
it's
not.
you
--
you
said
the
whole
question
is
deferring
to
the
courts
of
habitual
residence,
but
this
statute
is
not
raised
in
terms
of
court
jurisdiction.
it's
in
terms
of
the
right
of
a
custodial
parent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
relying
on
the
order;
you're
just
relying
on
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happens
to
the
woman
who,
now
she
has
abducted
the
child
to
texas,
and
she
says
to
the
texas
court:
if
you
send
me
back,
i
am
going
to
be
beaten
by
this
man
who
has
a
history
of
being
a
batterer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
saying
that
the
court
--
the
court
that's
asked
to
give
effect
to
the
convention
is
helpless,
that
it's
automatic
that
if
there
is
a
custody
right,
the
court
in
the
state
to
which
the
child
has
been
taken
must
order
that
the
child
be
returned?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
howe,
wasn't
the
--
the
problem
that
gave
rise
to
this
abduction
convention
just
the
situation
that
justice
breyer
brought
up?
that
is,
the
parent
that
has
visitation
rights
snatches
the
child,
takes
it
to
that
parent's
home
country,
and
then
you
are
relying
on
only
the
court
order.
that's
why
we
have
the
hague
convention
on
the
abduction
of
children.
it
wasn't
for
the
--
i
mean,
this
--
this
case
is
not
the
usual
case.
the
usual
case
is
the
noncustodial
parent
takes
the
child
out
of
the
country
where
the
custodial
parent
lives.
and,
internationally,
there
was
a
huge
problem
of
getting
the
child
back,
and
that's
why
we
have
the
hague
convention
on
abduction,
because
courts
weren't
enforcing
foreign
court
orders.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
significance
of
their
breaking
down
the
two
categories?
one
is
the
rights
of
custody,
and
the
other
is
rights
of
access.
because
i
take
it
that
under
your
view
of
the
chilean
law,
given
that
the
noncustodial
parent
will
always
have
this
right
to
block
taking
the
child
out
of
the
country,
then
there's
really
no
difference
between
the
two
categories,
because
every,
say,
father
with
the
right
of
access
--
not
custody,
just
access
--
would
automatically
by
virtue
of
the
law
of
chile
have
this
one
custodial
right;
that
is,
to
block
taking
the
child
out
of
the
country.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
question
what
the
representative
of
the
mother
has
said
in
this
case,
that
the
emphasis
--
when
this
hague
convention
was
before
congress,
the
emphasis
was
on
the
custodial
parent
--
that
is,
the
person
in
the
situation
of
the
mother
here
--
that
what
congress
was
told
was
the
urgent
problem
was
the
noncustodial
parent
taking
the
child
away
from
the
custodial
parent.
that
was
the
--
the
major
thing
that
drove
this
convention
and
that's
what
the
state
department
told
congress;
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
could
say
--
you
can
say
that
the
mother
did
not
have
full
custodial
rights.
one
custodial
right
is
certainly
to
determine
where
the
child
will
live.
and
the
mother
did
not
have
that
right
with
respect
to
taking
the
child
out
of
the
country.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
provision--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
he
has
the
right
to
say
no,
don't
take
the
child
out
of
the
country,
then
he
has
something
more
than
a
right
of
access.
you
--
you
are
talking,
well,
she
has
the
rights
of
custody.
but
because
he
--
it's
not
just
the
court,
because
it's
his
consent
in
the
first
instance.
he
has
a
right
to
determine
that
the
child
shall
not
live
outside
the
country
of
habitual
residence.
that
is
not
a
right
of
access.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
statute
says
the
consent
of
the
--
of
the
other
parent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
true
of
custody
decrees
generally.
we
get
them
modified
by
a
court
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
so
it
--
but
in
the
first
instance,
it
says
--
it's
he
has
the
consent
or
withholding
consent.
and
my
question
to
you
is,
whatever
that
is,
it
isn't
a
right
of
access?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
just
says
that
the
right
of
access
is
the
right
to
take
a
child
for
a
limited
period
of
time
to
a
place
other
than
the
child's
habitual
residence.
there's
nothing
about
procedure
or
substance
in
this;
it
says
this
is
what
right
to
custody
is,
and
this
is
what
right
of
access
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
according
to
the
--
what
is
it,
the
chilean
central
authority,
you
know,
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
the
second
circuit,
i
think
in
the
duran
case.
the
--
the
authority
within
chile
that
is
responsible
for
the
implementation
of
this
hague
convention
said
that
it
regarded
that
statute
to
create
a
custody
right
for
purposes
of
the
hague
convention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
a
sentence
in
there
--
and
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
that
said
that
the
statute,
under
chilean
law,
amounted
to
a
right
of
joint
custody.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
--
you
have
a
lady--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--elizabeth
butler-sloss
in
the
court
of
appeal
in
england,
and
that
was
a
square
holding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
are
dicta.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
well,
you
can
take
the
german
constitutional
court.
