chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1553,
kawasaki
kisen
kaisha,
ltd.
v.
regal-beloit
corporation,
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
ballenger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
--
what
if
congress
was
wrong?
i
mean,
the
language
that
they
adopted
sure
looks
quite
different
to
me
than
what
was
applicable
prior
to
1978,
and
the
boilerplate
provision
that,
oh,
when
we
codify
this
we
don't
mean
to
change
anything
--
i
mean,
which
prevails,
the
actual
language
they
used
or
that
boilerplate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
are
--
those
are
two
different
arguments,
right;
your
rail
carrier
argument
and
your
pre-1978
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
prior
to
1978.
if
i
think
you
lose
under
that
question
under
the
law
as
happens
to
be
currently
codified,
but
would
prevail
under
the
pre-1978
law,
what
is
your
strongest
case
for
the
proposition
that
what
i
referred
to
earlier
as
the
boilerplate
language
trumps
the
plain
language
of
the
currently
codified
version?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
a
difficult
--
i
mean,
if
you
are
a
shipper
and
you
are
trying
to
figure
out,
okay,
let's
ship
some
goods,
and
you
pick
up
the
law
and
it
says,
well,
this
is
what
the
law
says,
who's
going
to
tell
you
that,
well,
you
may
think
that's
what
the
law
says,
but
you
are
really
governed
by
the
pre-1978
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
ballenger.
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
read
--
i
read
your
brief,
like
your
friend's,
as
relying
almost
exclusively
on
the
pre-1978
language.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
union
pacific
petition
appendix?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
may
not
have
anything
to
do
with
anything.
is
there
a
reason
the
stb
doesn't
appear
on
your
brief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
did
in
the
kirby
case
just
a
few
years
ago.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
part
of
your
argument
--
you
don't
rely
heavily
on
your
plain
language
argument
when
it
comes
to
deciding
that
these
huge
ocean
vessels
are
rail
carriers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
a
little
bit
different
from
your
argument
that
they
are
a
rail
carrier
because
their
bill
of
lading
would
cover
the
train
ride
to
chicago.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
weren't
--
if
it
weren't
for
the
--
for
the
track
from
long
beach
to
los
angeles,
you
would
say
then
they
are
not
a
rail
carrier?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
unless
we
hold,
as
your
friends
argue
on
the
other
side,
that
they
can
opt
out
under
10709.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
a
different
question
with
respect
to
liability
and
claims
than
with
respect
to
venue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
now
you
could
respond
to
my
question
about
the
distinction
under
10502
between
claims
and
liability
and
venue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
a
little
--
i
mean,
am
looking
at
page
64a
of
the
petition
appendix,
where
they
are
saying
you
can't
exempt
through
contractual
terms
for
liability
and
claims.
venue
is
treated
elsewhere,
separately
from
liability
and
claims.
so
again,
under
--
you
are
the
plain
language
team,
and
that
seems
fairly
plain
that
venue
is
not
covered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
the
liability
is
not
where
you
can
bring
your
suit.
liability
is
liability.
venue
is
where
you
can
bring
your
suit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
because
they
have
contracted
for
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
don't
own
union
pacific's
rail
line.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
i
--
if
i
own
a
container
being
pulled
by
somebody
else's
train,
i'm
in
the
train
business?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
wouldn't.
it
would
just
--
it
may
not
just
mean
that
they
don't
have
the
regulatory
authority
because
that
container
is
a
rail
carrier.
what
is
carrying
it
is
the
rail
carrier.
it's
a
container.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
--
they
can't
contract
around
liability
for
an
event
such
as
the
one
that
happened
here.
because
they
have
to
offer
carmack-compliant
terms,
and
if
the
owner
of
the
goods
has
the
option
of
accepting
those,
they
can't
contract
around
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
ballenger,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
today
in
case
08-1553,
kawasaki
kisen
kaisha
versus
beloit
corp.
and
the
consolidated
case.
