i
thought
the
government
told
us
in
this
--
in
that
case
that
carmack
wasn't
in
the
case
because
it
was
either
waived
or
something.
but
the
case
was
considered
on
the
basis
of
on
the
one
hand,
cogsa,
and
on
the
other,
the
law
of
50
states.
justice
ruth

ginsburg
yes,
but
uniformity
is
one
thing
when
you
are
talking
about
50
states
and
another
when
it's
just
two
federal
statutes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
are
looking
where,
now?
