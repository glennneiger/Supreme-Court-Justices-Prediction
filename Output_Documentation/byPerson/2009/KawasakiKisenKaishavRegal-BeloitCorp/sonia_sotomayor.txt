justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
taking
--
are
you
taking
a
position
different
than
the
u.s.,
that
it
applies
to
exports
but
not
imports?
i
think
the
--
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
any
import
or
export.
is
it
yours
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
imports?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
something?
is
there
--
do
you
know
if
there
is
a
railroad
line
from
the
u.s.
through
to
--
through
mexico?
i
know
there
is
one
from
new
york
to
canada,
a
freight
line.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
are?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
--
i'm
sorry.
i'm
a
little
confused.
your
position
is
that
"k"
line
--
you
are
representing
whom
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
a
bit
of
a
conflict,
don't
you?
because
isn't
"k"
line
taking
the
position
it's
not
a
rail
line,
and
who
are
you
speaking
for
when
you
say
it's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
it's
considered
what?
if
it's
considered--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--where
is
that
defined
in
carmack?
where
in
the
pre-1978
provisions
or
in
the
current
statute
is
that
to
be
read?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
--
i
am
trying
to
find
it,
statutorily.
and
what
case
says
that?
what
case
of
ours
defines
a
--
a
receiving
carrier
in
that
particular
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
only
one--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
only
one
who
has
--
the
board
has
jurisdiction
over
is
the
railroad.
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over
the
ocean
carrier
receiving.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
you
are
the
--
you
have
to
be
the
person
--
the
railroad
has
to
be
the
person
receiving
the
goods,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are
not
reading
the
language.
doesn't
the
language
say
the
person
who
receives
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
keep
going
back
to:
what
language
tells
me
that
particular
point
in
the
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
my
problem.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
always
thought
that
the
purpose
of
carmack
was
to
ensure
rail
responsibility,
rail
carrier
responsibility,
so
that
it
was
one
bill
of
lading
with
respect
to
all
railroad
connections.
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
carmack--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
on
the
rail
line.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
on
rail
--
on
rail
transportation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
historically
you
say
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
pre-1978
carmack,
there
is
a
--
if
you
want
to
take
a
look
at
it,
it
is
in
page
99a
of
your
petition.
it
reads:
"if
the
loss,
damage,
or
injury
occurs
while
the
property
is
in
the
custody
of
a
carrier
by
water,
that
liability
--
the
liability
of
such
carrier
shall
be
determined
by
the
bill
of
lading
of
the
carrier
by
water
and
by
and
under
the
laws
applicable
to
transportation
by
water.
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
explain
to
me
what
happens
in
domestic
water
cases.
it
says
that
you
can
have
a
different
bill
of
lading
for
the
water
transport.
that
bill
of
lading
controls
your
damage
on
the
water,
and
it
separates
that
out
from
damage
on
the
rail
side?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
railroad
is
covered
by
any
damage
that
occurs
on
land?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
already
is
domestically
two
different
forms
of
liability
protection?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me,
can
i
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
perhaps,
as
i
understand
this,
i
think
we
are
all
forgetting
that
none
of
these
liability
provisions
come
into
play
until
there
is
proof
that
an
incident
has
occurred
somewhere,
either
on
a
railroad
or
on
the
ocean,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
the
issue
becomes
which
set
of
rules
governs
that
particular
incident--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--where
it
happens.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
justice
breyer
asked
you
why
it
made
sense
that
there
would
be
two
rules
in
effect
for
what
happens
on
the
ocean
and
what
happens
on
land;
and
if
we
had
it,
wouldn't
it
create
great
difficulty.
i
think
--
you
may
correct
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
your
case
--
does
your
case
end
if
we
hold
that
"k"
line
is
not
a
railroad
carrier?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
a
delivering
carrier.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
just
--
just
briefly
before
you
answer
the
justice
--
the
chief.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
what
capacity
--
"k"
line
is
the
contracting
party
with
union
pacific.
under
what
contract
could
the
shipper
sue
union
pacific?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
"k"
line
is
--
is
the
shipper.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
regardless
of
whether
the
shipment
was
by
them
directly
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
--
i
am
a
little
bit
confused
now.
now,
back
to
being
confused.
you
are
suggesting
that
from
the
landing,
it's
an
ocean
carrier.
and
the
minute
that
the
containers
are
unloaded
from
the
vessel
and
put
on
land,
it
becomes
a
railroad
carrier,
even
though
its
delivery
contract
may
have
ended
at
that
point?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
about
--
what
is
it
that
you're
arguing
makes
them
a
railroad
carrier
once
they
put
it
there.
let's
assume
the
reverse
is
the
hypothetical
that
you
--
that
you
posited.
they
deliver
to
the
dock,
and
union
pacific
is
the
one
that
owns
those
three
to
six
miles
of
connection
to
its
main
railroad.
it's
the
one
who
is
going
to
provide
the
motor
carriage.
it's
the
one
who
is
going
to
take
it
from
the
--
the
dock
and
bring
it
in.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
not
merely
that
it
has
possession
of
the
container
that
it
has
dropped
somewhere.
it
has
to
transport
it
in
some
way
in
relationship
to
the
railroad?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
you
say
"engaging
in",
are
you
talking
about
vis-à-vis
this
shipment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
is
it
just
in
general?
vis-à-vis
you?
