mr.
anthony
yang
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
a
few
of
the
questions
that
have
come
up
already.
justice
sotomayor
you
asked
what
supreme
court
decision
addresses
the
receiving
carrier.
there
is
a
series
of
decisions
which
address
receiving
carriers
and
the
nature
of
the
receiving
carrier
as
the
initial
care
that
receives
goods
from
the
shipper.
i
would
--
mexican
light
and
power
company,
1947,
is
probably
the
best,
but
that
traces
its
way
back
all
the
way
to
the
1910s,
galveston
wharf
company,
ward,
starburg,
lish
milling,
riverside
mills.
these
cases
are
largely
cited
at
our
brief
at
page
27
to
28,
footnote
10.
regarding
the
geographic
scope
of
carmack
on
the
current
text,
we
believe
that
the
current
text,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
petition
appendix
at
69a
--
if
you
look
at
the
combination
of
both
the
first
and
the
third
sentences
of
carmack,
we
believe
that
that
reproduces
the
historic
scope
as
encompassing
only
domestic
transportation,
purely
domestic
transportation,
and
transportation
to
an
adjacent
foreign
country
when
it's
an
export.
the
first
sentence
requires
that
the
rail
carrier
be
providing
transportation
or
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
issue
a
receipt
or
bill
of
lading.
the
very
purpose
of
carmack
from
the
very
beginning,
its
core
purpose,
was
to
allow
a
shipper
to
sue
the
initial
carrier.
the
initial
carrier
was
responsible
for
the
entire
shipment.
all
the
connecting
carriers
were
deemed
to
be
agents
of
the
initial
carrier
and
therefore
there
was
an
easy
defendant
for
the
shipper
who
dealt
directly
with
that
shipper
--
or
that
carrier,
and
received
a
bill
of
lading
from
that
carrier
to
sue.
mr.
anthony
yang
our
brief
addressed
the
first
sentence
briefly
in,
i
believe,
the
prior
page.
page
20
to
21
deals
with
the
first
sentence,
and
then
22
with
the
third.
but
our
point
is
that
the
first
sentence
sets
an
anchor
in
the
united
states
as
the
--
as
the
origin
of
the
shipment.
part
a
jurisdiction
--
this
is
reproduced
at
page
62a
in
the
petition
appendix.
it
does
cover
shipments
that
themselves
transit
united
states
and
foreign
countries.
mr.
anthony
yang
62a
of
the
petition
appendix.
this
is
section
10501,
which
defines
part
a
jurisdiction
of
the
stb.
and
then
i'm
looking--
mr.
anthony
yang
--they
are
both
--
both
of
them
are
actually
the
same.
both
the
petition
appendixes
are
the
same.
so
i'm
looking
down
at
--
a.
2
provides
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
stb
applies
only
to
transportation
into
the
united
states
when
that's
between
--
you
know,
part
of
a
larger
transit
between
the
u.s.
and
a
foreign
country
or
even
purely
domestically.
so,
a
shipper
--
or
a
carrier
that
is
subject
to
stb
jurisdiction
has
to
be
providing
this
u.s.
transportation
when
it
issues
the
bill
of
lading.
so
the
--
again,
the
central
purpose
was
to
provide
a
carrier
by
which
--
against
whom
the
shipper
can
bring
suit
in
a
convenient
form,
the
person
that
the
shipper
dealt
with.
and
that's
now
reflected
in
section
--
the
forum
provision
of
carmack
which
is
subsection
(d)(2),
it
provides
that
a
suit
under
carmack
may
only
be
brought
against
the
originating
rail
carrier
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
point
of
origin
is
located.
and
the
prior
provision
said
that
that's
a
u.s.
district
court
or
a
state
court.
carmack
itself
anchors
the
transportation
as
starting
in
the
united
states.
and
then
the
third
sentence
explains
the
remainder
of
the
historic
scope.
the
third
sentence--
mr.
anthony
yang
--this
is
back
to
69(a)
of
carmack.
the
third
sentence
in
subsection
(b),
it
defines
the
liability
under
carmack.
it
says
"the
liability
under
this
section
is
for
damage
caused
by
the
receiving
carrier,
the
delivering
carrier
or
another
rail
carrier
over
whose
line
or
route
the
property
is
transited
in
the
united
states
or
from
a
place
in
the
united
states
to
a
place
in
an
adjacent
foreign
country.
"
so,
what
that
does
is
that
provides
the
center
for
the
two
bookends.
the
first
bookend
is
the
originating
carrier,
the
receiving
carrier
that
received
the
goods
in
the
united
states,
provides
the
bill
of
lading
to
the
shipper.
the
second
bookend
is
the
delivering
carrier,
and
in
between
--
remember
carmack
was
intended
to
cover
the
entire
carriage
as
a
unified
whole.
the
in-between
is
transportation
in
the
united
states
or
export
transportation
from
the
united
states
to
a
point
in
a
foreign
country.
we
believe
that
that
text,
read
as
a
whole,
reflects
the
historic
scope
of
carmack
that's
existed
since
1915
when
it
was
extended
beyond
purely
domestic
transportation.
mr.
anthony
yang
correct.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
we
believe
the
portion
of
(a)(3),
which
now
looks
like
it's
in
(a)(3),
the
"over
whose
line
or
route
the
property
is
transited
--
transported.
"
actually
applies
to
the
receiving
and
delivering
rail
carrier.
if
you
would
turn
to
page
5a
and
6a
of
the
reply
brief
of
union
pacific,
there
is
a
side-by-side
comparison.
mr.
anthony
yang
i'm
sorry--
mr.
anthony
yang
--from
5a
to
6a,
you
will
see
5a
is
the
1978
version
of
carmack
that
was
enacted
in
the
1978
codification.
mr.
anthony
yang
the
current
version
is
reflected
on
the
facing
page.
there
was
no
paragraph
indentation
in
1978.
and
in
1995
when
congress
changed
the
text,
it
did
include
a
paragraph
indentation,
but
the
committee
report
--
the
conference
report
is
very
clear
that
carmack
was
not
changed.
also--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
i
don't
know
--
you
mean
the
indentation?
mr.
anthony
yang
the
indentation
was
inadvertent.
and
i
would
actually
direct
the
court
to
73a,
which
is
the
other
part
of
carmack
that
now
exists
for
motor
transportation
and
freight
forwarders.
there
is
no
indentation.
the
current
version
of
the
other
half
of
carmack
does
not
provide
the
indentation.
the
indentation
is
inadvertent.
and
in
'95
--
the
'95,
which--
mr.
anthony
yang
--73a.
(a)(1)
reproduces
what
we
were
just
looking
for
--
looking
at
in
the
rail
carrier.
mr.
anthony
yang
it's
a
single
paragraph.
that's
the
way
it's
existed
since,
you
know,
1915,
basically,
or
1927
when
they
added
receiving
carrier.
so
what
the
court
can
do
--
it's
true,
carmack
is
less
clear
than
it
used
to
be.
it
was
made
somewhat
less
clear
in
'78
and
in
'95.
but
we
believe
that
when
you
take
the
text
as
a
whole,
particularly
when
read
in
light
of
the
context
of
this
court's
decision,
the
longstanding
practice
in
the
united
states
reflected
in
the
stb
--
the
stb's
decision,
that
is
the
icc's
decision,
the
predecessor,
that
at
least
the
provision
is
ambiguous.
and
if
the
provision
is
ambiguous,
section
3(a)
that
mandated
the
statute
should
not
be
construed
to
make
a
substantive
change
in
the
law
should
control.
mr.
anthony
yang
the
stb
does
not
appear
in
our
brief--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it
did.
it
did.
the
stb
has
not
taken
a
position
about
the
current
scope
of
carmack
and
therefore
decided
not
to
join
our
brief.
mr.
anthony
yang
no.
i
would
say,
though,
that
the
icc's
decisions
remain
binding.
that
is
1995,
the
statute,
icda
section
204(a),
which
is
a
note
now
to
section
701
of
title
49,
specifically
provided
that
the
icc's
orders
and
determinations
would
remain
binding
unless
changed
by
the
stb.
the
stb
just
did
not,
at
this
point,
come
on
record
and
take
a
position
about
the
scope
of
carmack.
mr.
anthony
yang
in
part.
there's
--
if
you--
mr.
anthony
yang
--that
would
take
care
of
the
initial
carrier,
what
we
believe
is
the
initial
receiving
carrier
in
the
case,
"k"
line.
however,
i
believe
the
argument
is
being
made
that
carmack
could
suddenly
apply
mid-carriage
at
the
border.
mr.
anthony
yang
i
believe
the
argument
is
that
the
first
carrier
who
receives
property
in
the
united
states
would
be
deemed
the
receiving
carrier.
mr.
anthony
yang
that's
a
separate
argument.
mr.
anthony
yang
you
would
have
--
excuse
me?
mr.
anthony
yang
it
did
not.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
did
not.
mr.
anthony
yang
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
is
a
different
--
but
we
think
it's
clearly
wrong
in
light
of
carmack's
historic
purpose.
this
would
be
to
divide
the
--
the
--
if
that
were
correct,
it
would
divide
the
transportation
in
two.
mr.
anthony
yang
thank
you.
