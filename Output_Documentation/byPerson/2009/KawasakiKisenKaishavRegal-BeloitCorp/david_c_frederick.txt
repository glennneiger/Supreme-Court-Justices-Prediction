mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
does
not
take
great
mental
gymnastics
to
read
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
and
resolve
it
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
favor
of
respondents.
the
case
is
controlled
by
the
plain
language
of
several
federal
statutes,
and
they
have
been
averted
to,
to
some
extent.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
2-1/2
pages
of
our
merits
brief,
starting
at
page
26
and
going
over
to
page
28,
we
not
only
cite
the
full
language
in
full
of
the
carmack
amendment
and
the
jurisdictional
provision
of
the
stb,
but
explain
how
union
pacific
is
a
delivering
carrier
within
the
meaning
of
the
carmack
amendment;
under
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute,
they
are
liable
for
the
loss;
the
carmack
amendment
applies
to
their
receipt
of
the
property;
and
the
train
derailment
which
was
caused
by
their
negligence
comes
within
the
plain
terms
of
the
carmack
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
in
fact,
carmack--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--explicitly
says,
quote:
"failure
to
issue
a
receipt
or
bill
of
lading
does
not
affect
the
liability
of
a
rail
carrier.
"
carmack--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
do
not
have
to
issue--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
it
won't,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
not
--
it
is
true
and
not
true,
but
for
different
reasons.
and
if
i
could
take
a
moment
to
explain,
because
i
think
it
is
important.
in
1978
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
defined
what
the
stb's
jurisdiction
is.
they
do
not
dispute
that
the
last
part
of
the
jurisdictional
provision
is
the
stb
jurisdiction
when
a
--
a
shipment
is
in,
quote,
"between
the
united
states
and
a
place
in
a
foreign
country.
"
but
the
stb
only
has
jurisdiction
to
the
extent
the
transportation
occurs
in
the
united
states.
so
it
is
true
that
imports
into
the
united
states
are
covered
by
the
carmack
amendment,
but
only
to
the
extent
of
the
transportation
being
within
the
united
states.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
let
me
go
back
--
let
me
go
back
to
the
international
point,
justice
breyer,
because
the
railroads
argued
against
an
international
uniform
rule
that
would
apply
both
to
ocean
carriage
and
inland
carriage
in
the
rotterdam
rules.
and
they
made
the
representation
to
the
international
community,
you
don't
need
to
have
a
uniform
rule
that
applies
to
both
ocean
carriage
and
inland
carriage,
because
we
have
this
thing
called
the
carmack
amendment.
and
they
made
the
representation
that
the
carmack
amendment
would
apply
to
imports,
as
this
court
in
the
woodbury
case
written
by
justice
brandeis,
decided
in
1920,
and
a
month
earlier--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i'm
arguing
that
their
position
is
inconsistent
with
their
representations,
and
therefore
the
plain
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
i'm--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--their
earlier
--
their
earlier
position
was
correct
under
the
plain
language
of--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
plain
language,
justice
scalia,
as
it
is
currently
enforced
i
think
disposes
of
the
case
without
any
real
argument.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
how
the
world--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--correct.
and
that's
how
--
that's
how
europe
operates.
europe
has
separate
conventions
for
rail
and
road
that
apply
to
damage
that
occur
on
land
and
the
european
nations
have
acceded
to
the
various
versions
of
hague
rules--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
it's
transport--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
the
surface
transportation
board,
justice
breyer,
that
has
the
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
they
can.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
can.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
i
want
to
answer
justice
kennedy's
question.
they
can.
these
are
background
rules
that
we
are
talking
about
and
they
will
be
contracted
around.
after
the
sompo
decision
was
decided
in
the
second
circuit,
union
pacific
went
right
out
and
changed
the
contract
that
they
had
with
ocean
carriers
to
ensure
that
the
ocean
carriers
would
indemnify
them
if
they
were
liable
and
did
not
get
the
full
benefits
of
contractual
extensions.
what
we're
talking
about
here--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--is
whether
there's
an
american
forum
for
american
cargo
interests
for
an
american
train
that
is
derailed
in
the
united
states.
that's
what
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
let
me
go
to
that
point
now,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
port
of
long
beach
is
situated
more
than
20
miles
from
los
angeles
and
the
port
has
60
miles
of
train
track
with
intermodal,
multimodal
facilities
that
get
the
cargo
containers,
which
20
miles
away
to
the
los
angeles
train
depo
where
union
pacific
picks
them
up.
now,
under
20-mile
transport.
we
would
submit
as
a
factual
matter,
which
of
course
would
need
to
be
done
on
remand,
that
there
are
facts
that
can
be
adduced
to
establish
the
functionality
test
which
the
icc
has
long
administered
to
look
at
the
functions
being
performed
as
well
as--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
didn't
make
that
argument.
our
argument
was
that,
based
on
the
functions
and
them
holding
themselves
out
to
be
a
rail
carrier,
which
they
have
done,
they
qualify
under
the
normal
icc
method
of
determining
rail
carrier.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
argument
as
the
icc
is
defined
it
also
looks
at
things
like
the
multimodal
facilities,
like
the
containers,
and
--
and
the
holding
themselves
out
as
a
rail
carrier
in
their
advertising.
those
are
important
parts
of
the
functionality
test.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
there
are
--
there
are
two
ways
to
read
the
text
and
resolve
the
case.
one
is
to
say
up,
union
pacific,
as
the
delivering
rail
carrier.
under
the
statute
up
is
not
required
--
although
the
first
part
says
you
are
supposed
to
issue
a
bill
of
lading,
their
liability
for
the
train
derailment
does
not
turn
on
whether
they
issued
a
bill
of
lading
or
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
"k"
line
gets
out
of
the
case.
we
would
have
to
go
to
tokyo
to
pursue
"k"
line
under
the
bill
of
lading.
but
we
could
continue
our
suit
against
union
pacific
as
a
delivering
rail
carrier
delivering
carrier
under
the
carmack
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
you
would
need
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
exempt
carriage
under
10502
takes
away
the
option
of
a
10709
contract.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
and
let
me
address
that
if
i
might.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
sure.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
under
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--directly
under
the
carmack
amendment.
and
in
fact,
when
union
pacific
removed
this
case
from
state
court
to
federal
court,
the
federal
question
was
they
said:
there
is
a
carmack
amendment
claim
being
asserted
against
us.
that's
how
we
get
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
and
when
they
--
when
they
sought
to
transfer
the
case
from
california
to
new
york,
they
did
so
on
the
basis
of
the
convenience
of
28
of
the
32
witnesses
to
their
train
derailment
being
american
citizens.
so
it's
not
like
there
needs
to
be
some
special
--
there
is
a
special
cause
of
action
within
the
carmack
amendment,
justice
sotomayor,
that
provides
a
means
of
redress
for
damaged
cargo
interests
to
go
directly
against
the
railroad.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct,
if
they
caused
the
damage.
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
carmack
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
the
stb,
in
an
authoritative
determination
that
is
entitled
to
our
deference,
has
said
that
when
it
issues
an
exemption
for
certain
categories
of
rail
carriage,
which
it
has
done
with
the
multimodal
shipments,
those
exemptions
remove
the
possibility
of
a
10709
contract
carriage.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
both
situations
the
rail
carrier
has
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
carmack-compliant
terms
to
be
given
to
the
shipper.
if
it's
exempt
cargo
carriage
under
10502,
10502(e)
says
that
the
carrier
must
provide
carmack-compliant
terms
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
exemption
and
contract
under
the
exemption.
10709
provides
contract
carriage,
but
only
if
the
rail
carrier
provides
common
carrier
tariffs
that
a
cargo
interest
could
ship
under.
here,
because
the
transportation
is
exempt
under
105
--
10205,
there
is
no
common
carrier
tariff
that
is
applicable.
and
that's
why
the
stb
has
said
if
there
is
no
common
carrier
tariff
applicable
under
11101,
then
there
cannot
be
an
opportunity
for
contract
carriage.
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
make
the
statute
a
complete
deregulation
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no
--
well,
liability,
your
honor,
is
where
you
can
bring
your
suit
and
what
your
suit--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
--
the
way
the
board
has
construed
this
in
the
letter
brief
that
they
filed
in
the
--
in
the
second
circuit,
which
is
entitled
to
our
deference,
says
the
ninth
circuit
in
regal-beloit
got
it
right
with
respect
to
the
interplay
between
10502,
10709,
and
--
and
contract
carriage.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
is
what
this
court
held--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
"mead
did
not
overrule
auer,
and
in
auer
the
court,
this
court,
gave
deference
to
a
brief
by
the
federal
government
that
was
setting
forth
the
authoritative--
"
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
that
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
i
don't
know
why
--
it's
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
because
here
the
second
circuit
invited
the
views
of
the
stb
to
tell
us:
what
do
you
think
is
the
interplay
between
these
various
provisions?
and
the
stb
gave
an
authoritative
view
to
the
second
circuit
so
that
it
could
resolve
a
case
in
which
the
stb
was
not
a
party.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
those
are
the
chassis.
they
are
the
containers
that
are
used
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
--
the
--
cogsa
applies
tackle
to
tackling.
the
damage
is
occurring
on
a
ship.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
stb
has
no
jurisdiction
over
that.
carmack
does
not
apply.
it
is
only
once
the
ship--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
cogsa
itself,
which
is
set
out
in
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
i
can
give
--
the
provision
of
cogsa
that
you
are
looking
for
is
the
definition
of
"carriage",
which
is
set
forth
in--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--page
48a
of
the
petition
appendix,
and
it
is
1(e).
the
term
"carriage
of
goods"
covers
the
period
from
the
time
when
the
goods
are
loaded
on
to
the
time
when
they
are
discharged
from
the
ship.
and
as
the
court
in
kirby
said--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--right.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
carmack
only
applies
if
it
is
carriage
and
transportation
within
the
stb's
jurisdiction.
the
stb
has
no
jurisdiction
over
cogsa
carriers.
that's
the
federal
maritime
commission.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
ship
is
performing
two
different
functions,
justice
breyer.
it
is
performing
an
ocean
function,
and
then
once
its
on
land
--
and
there
were
thousands
of
"k"
line
containers
all
over
the
united
states
right
now
where
"k"
line
is
performing
services,
motor
service
and
rail
carriage
services,
here
in
the
united
states.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
own
them.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
they
own
the
containers
that
union
pacific
is
pulling.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
under
the
definition
of
functionality,
where
that
is
part
of
how
the
stb
regulates.
and
to
say
otherwise,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
to
deny
the
federal
government
the
regulatory
authority
over
containers
that
come
into
this
country
representing
approximately
80
%
of
the
trade.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
they
--
well,
at
one
level,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
sort
of
academic,
because
the
stb
exempted
from
part
a,
which
includes
the
carmack
amendment,
those
containers,
and
it
did
so
in
an
exemption
order
which
we
cited
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
so
at
some
level,
there
is
an
academic
quality
to
this
colloquy.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
if
its
delivery
contract
ended
at
that
point
it
did
not
hold
itself
out
as
a
rail
carrier--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
can
i
just
add
to
the
hypothetical
the
fact,
which
is
an
important
fact:
did
the
rail
carrier
hold
itself
out
to
the
public
as
a
rail
carrier
in
making
the
contract
with
the
original
shipper?
because
that
is
an
important
fact
that
does
not
help
us
resolve
your
particular
hypothetical,
justice
sotomayor.
if
up
is
picking
up
the
goods
with
its
equipment,
the
ocean
carrier
is
not
a
rail
carrier
under
our
theory
of
the
case.
there
has
to
be
functions
being
performed
that
are
multimodal
functions
and
the
ocean
carrier
has
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
that's
the
best
way
to
understand
the
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
--
on
62a,
the
petition
appendix
defines
the
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
at
(a)(2)
--
will
you
look
at
(a)(2),
please?
(a)(2)
says
jurisdiction
under
paragraph
1
applies
only
to
transportation
in
the
united
states.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
the
united
states.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
exactly.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
thank
you.
[laughter]
now,
it
is
not
true
that
the
law
was
settled
prior
to
1978.
the
woodbury
case
applied
the
carmack
amendment
to
imports.
union
pacific
v.
burke
applied
it
to
imports.
and
in
those
cases,
this
court
made
the
determination
that
the
words
"from"
and
"to"
were
also
meaning
"between".
and
congress,
when
it
cleaned
up
the
statute
in
1978
and
provided
words
that
are
very
easy
to
understand
now,
was
not
changing
what
had
been
a
well-settled
practice
of
goods
that
were
getting
--
arriving
at
a
port
in
the
united
states
and
then
being
transported
by
land
means.
and
it's
important
to
understand
the
context
in
which
this
arose.
because
i
think
our
fundamental
disagreement
with
the
solicitor
general's
presentation
is
that
it
ignores
the
container
revolution
that
was
occurring
between
the
late
1950's
and
the
'70s,
when
this
act
was
codified
and
cleaned
up.
and
in
that
container
revolution,
prior
to
the
time
when
containers
were
used
for
multimodal
transportation,
it
was
common
for
goods
to
be
repackaged
at
ports
in
the
united
states.
they
were
taken
off
ships.
they
were
repackaged,
put
onto
trains
or
trucks,
and
that
required
a
separate
contractual
arrangement.
now,
this
court,
in
woodbury
and
burke,
had
said
it
is
not
so
important
whether
or
not
there
is
a
separate
contract,
so
long
as
the
function
and
the
intent
is
clear
that
it
is
being
moved
by
rail
or
road
in
the
united
states.
the
carmack
amendment
will
apply,
justice
sotomayor.
you
are
completely
correct
that
the
purpose
of
the
carmack
amendment
was
to
hold
railroads
and
motor
carriers
responsible
for
the
liabilities
caused
by
their
loss.
but
when
congress
cleaned
that
up
and
put
it
in
section
3,
it
was
not
intending
to
obviate
the
clear
and
unambiguous
language
of
the
statute.
it
was
simply
providing,
you
know,
some
boilerplate
that
i
think
is
very
difficult
to
--
to
cause
the
court
to
override
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
today.
and
in
1995,
when
congress
eliminated
--
terminated
the
icc
and
enacted
the
icc
termination
act,
it
reenacted
that
language.
it
did
not
encompass
section
3
at
that
time,
so
the
statute
as
it
presently
exists
does
not
have
a
statutory
pointer
as
to
how
you
are
to
interpret
the
language.
and
under
the
normal
canons
that
this
court
has
instructed
for
courts
in
the
bar,
the
easiest
way
to
practice
law
in
this
area
is
to
look
at
the
statute,
see
what
it
says,
and
not
have
to
go
back,
not
just
through
the
last
iteration
of
the
statute,
but
the
one
before
that,
and
not
just
to
be
able
to
look
at
what
was
in
the
u.s.
code,
but
to
have
to
go
back
to
the
statutes
at
large
to
see
what
other
statutory
provisions
congress
had
put
into
the
statute.
that
would
make
the
practice
of
law
extremely
difficult.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
--
i
would
concede
the
point
of
interchange
at
the
port,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that.
i
will
concede
that
point,
so
long
as,
you
know,
we
are
talking
about
an
immediate
nexus
between
the
vessel
and
the
ship.
and
--
and
that
is
not
--
not
a
point
that
we
have
to
prevail
on
to
win
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
are
60--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
there
was
no
discovery
because
this
was
decided
on
the
pleadings
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
believe
that
once
discovery
is
permitted,
if
you
allow
the
case
to
go
back
for
factual
development,
that
the
facts
would
reveal
that
"k"
line
was
engaging
in
significant
rail
operations
that
at
least
get
us
beyond
--
into
the
realm
of
legitimate
advocacy.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
when
my
colleague
here
says
that
we
take
the
position
that
carmack
cannot
be
contracted
around,
that
is
not
true.
our
point
here
is
that
when
there
is
exempt
carriage,
the
stb
has
already
defined
this
as
something
that
can
be
provided
by
contract,
but
we
believe
that
10502(e)
says
that
they
have
to
provide
carmack-compliant
terms.
the
industry
will
adapt
to
a
decision
by
this
court
in
setting
the
background
rules.
we
would
submit
that
the
simpler
regime
and
the
one
that
the
railroad
had
advocated
in
the
international
community
was
their
--
was
for
there
to
be
a
u.s.
statute
that
applies
and
not
to
allow
complete
deregulation
through
contracts--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
and
--
and
the
point
here
about
the
forum
is
an
important
one,
because
union
pacific
has
never
thought
that
in
these
ocean
bills
of
lading
that
that
entitles
american
cargo
interest
to
have
to
go
to
a
foreign
country
under
the
ocean
carrier's
bill
of
lading
in
order
to
vindicate
the
interests
in
damage
to
their
cargo.
that
was
an
invention
by
up
sought
to
remove
it
under
the
carmack
amendment
and
transfer
it
to
new
york,
and
up
joined
that
motion
and
has
argued
throughout
that
the
carmack
amendment
applies.
it
would
be
unusual,
to
say
the
least,
to
allow
up
now
to
take
advantage
of
a
contractual
extension
of
cogsa
where
section
12
of
cogsa,
by
its
plain
terms,
in
language
that
is
completely
ignored
by
the
other
side,
says
cogsa
stops
basically
at
the
tackle-to-tackle
period
and
does
--
otherwise
does
not
affect
otherwise
applicable
law.
and
there
is
a
specific
reference
in
section
12
to
the
harter
act
and
any
other
applicable
law.
and
in
1936,
when
congress
enacted
cogsa
to
implement
the
united
states
--
of
the
hague
rules,
it
was
aware
of
the
carmack
amendment.
