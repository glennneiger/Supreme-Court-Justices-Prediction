mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
its
enactment
in
1906
until
very
recently,
it
has
been
settled
law
for
a
century
that
the
carmack
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
inland
leg
of
an
import
through
shipment.
this
court
had
a
factually
identical--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
both
of
our
position
is
that
the
current
scope
of
carmack
is
consistent
with
its
historic
scope,
which
had
a
very
limited
special
application
to
exports
to
canada
and
mexico.
other
than
that,
it
doesn't
apply
to
foreign
trade
at
all.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
there
certainly
are
rail
connections
between
the
united
states
and
mexico,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
yes,
absolutely.
this
court
had
a
factually
identical
import
case
just
a
few
years
ago
in
kirby
and,
although
it
did
not
discuss
the
carmack
amendment,
this
court
agreed
unanimously
on
both
reasoning
and
a
result
that
are
flatly
inconsistent
with
respondent's
arguments
here.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
that's
correct,
justice.
the
united
states
represented
to
this
court
that
--
that
carmack
was
not
in
the
case,
either
because
it
was
waived
or
because
the
traffic
was
moving
under
49
u.s.c.
section
10709,
which
of
course
is
true
here
as
well.
our
view
has
always
been
that
this
court
wouldn't
have
granted
certiorari
purely
on
the
basis
of
a
waiver.
but
in
any
event,
this
court's
reasoning
in
kirby
was
that
it's
very
important
to
foreign
trade
and
to
the
uniformity
of
rules
on
a
through
shipment--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
but
the
--
for
more
than
a
century,
the
relevant
federal
statutes
have
been
construed
harmoniously
not
to
overlap
in
this
particular
situation.
foreign
ocean
commerce
is
governed
by
the
carriage
of
goods
at
sea
act,
and
the
carmack
amendment
has
always
governed
purely
domestic
traffic
and
exports
to
canada
and
mexico.
now,
respondents
say
that
the
settled
meaning
of
that
statute
changed
dramatically
in
1978,
but
congress
said
that
it
didn't.
and
it's
not
really
that
hard
to
read
the
present
language--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court's
task,
as
always,
is
to
read
the
statute
as
a
whole,
which
includes
that
language
that
your
honor
characterizes
as
boilerplate,
and
also
includes
the
language
that
we
are
here
to
construe.
and
you
would
want
to
read
it
all
together
if
possible.
so
let's
look
at
the
--
at
the
present
language.
it
appears
at
the
back
of
union
pacific's
reply
brief
at
page
6a.
just
like
it
always
has,
carmack
distinguishes
between
receiving
carriers,
delivering
carriers,
and
connecting
carriers.
the
simplest
way
to
resolve
this
case
is
that
i
believe
even
respondents
would
concede
that
for
carmack
to
apply,
you
need
a
receiving
carrier
that
is
a
rail
carrier.
"k"
line
is
the
receiving
carrier
here
and
they
are
not
a
rail
carrier.
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
confirm
what
the
statute
plainly
says,
which
is
that
a
rail
carrier
is
a
party
providing
common
carrier
railroad
transportation,
not--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--they
are,
your
honor.
the
simplest
way
to
resolve
this
case
is
that
the
present
language,
even
taken
on
its
face,
requires
a
receiving
carrier
that
is
a
rail
carrier.
"k"
line
is
the
receiving
carrier
here.
they
are
not
a
rail
carrier.
this
court
and
the
icc
have
long
held
that
merely
subcontracting
for
common
carrier
service
does
not
make
you
a
common
carrier.
this
court
held
that
in
the
american
railway
express
case.
the
icc
made
this
crystal
clear
in
the
csx/sealand
matter
in
1987,
where
they
held
that
the
ocean
carrier
sealand
was
not
a
rail
carrier
simply
because
it
subcontracted
for
inland
rail
transportation
and
provided
carrier
containers
to
the
inland
rail
carrier.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
i
--
my
client
is
union
pacific,
but
i
am
here
today
speaking
for
both
of
the
petitioners,
"k"
line
and
union
pacific.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
for
both
of
us,
your
honor,
because
that
resolves
--
actually
resolves
the
case
for
both
"k"
line
and
union
pacific.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
"k"
line
--
the
statute
requires
--
to
be
triggered,
it
requires
a
receiving
carrier
that
is
a
rail
carrier.
"k"
line
is
the
receiving
carrier
here
and
they
are
not
a
rail
carrier.
so
then
the
question
becomes
--
union
pacific
certainly
is
a
rail
carrier.
the
question
becomes:
can
you
treat
union
pacific
as
the
receiving
carrier?
you
can't.
the
receiving
carrier
language
has
been
in
the
statute
since
1906.
it
has
never
changed.
and
for
a
century
it
has
always
meant
the
carrier
that
receives
the
property
from
the
shipper
at
the
point
of
origin.
the
current
language--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--well,
there
are
--
there
is
not
an
explicit
definition
of
the
term
"receiving
carrier",
your
honor.
it
appears
in
the
first
sentence
of
11706,
where
it
has
always
appeared
in
the
first
sentence
of
carmack,
and
then
there
are
implications
in
--
throughout
the
rest
of
carmack,
which
i'm
happy
to
talk
about.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
well,
let's
start
with
the
statutory
language,
if
we
may.
the
first
sentence
of
carmack
says
that
"a
rail
carrier
providing
transportation
or
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
under
this
part
shall
issue
a
receipt
or
bill
of
lading
for
property
it
receives
for
transportation
under
the--
"
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--that's
how--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
then
the
question
is--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--no,
your
honor.
the
receiving
carrier
has
always
been
the
party
at
the
point
of
origin
of
the
shipment.
and
you
see
if
you
look
at
the
venue
provision
in
the
current
language--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--no,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
two
separate
requirements.
it's
always
been
understood
as
two
separate
requirements.
carmack
requires
that
the
receiving
--
a
receiving
carrier
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
then
it
also
has
to
be
the
receiving
carrier.
the
receiving
carrier
is
the
originating
carrier.
if
you
look
at
the
venue
provision--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--because
otherwise
the
whole
structure
of
the
statute
doesn't
work.
carmack
draws
a
distinction
between
receiving
carriers,
delivering
carriers,
and
connecting
carriers.
if
receiving
property
directly
from
another
common
carrier
and
merely
moving
it
for
a
portion
of
the
journey
in
connecting
were
enough
to
make
you
a
receiving
carrier
--
and,
of
course,
it
is
in
common
parlance;
you
are
receiving
goods
in
that
circumstance.
--but
receiving--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--"receiving
carrier"
has
always
been
a
term
of
art
in
this
statute.
if
that
were
enough
to
make
you
a
receiving
carrier,
then
the
statutory
structure
would
fall
apart,
because
every
interim
carrier
in
the
line
would
be
a
receiving
carrier.
every
single
one
of
them
receives.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
that--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--it's
not
how
--
that's
not
how
the
statute
is
worded,
justice
scalia.
the
--
the
statute--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--correct.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
it
has
always--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--it
has
always
meant
that.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
has
always
meant
that.
it
has
to
mean
that,
because
otherwise,
if
you
read
it
to
mean
receives
from
another
carrier
then
every
connecting
carrier
or
delivering
carrier
in
the
chain
would
be
a
receiving
carrier
as
well
as
a
connecting
or
delivering
carrier
and
required
to
issue
its
own
bill
of
lading,
which
would
turn
the
historic
purposes
of
carmack
on
its
head.
the
purpose
of
carmack
was
to
require
the
first
carrier
in
the
chain
to
issue
a
single
through
bill
of
lading
to
the
destination
that
would
govern
the
whole
voyage
under
uniform
consistent
liability
terms.
no
one
else
in
the
chain
is
supposed
to
issue
a
bill
of
lading,
so
there
is
only
one
receiving
carrier.
it's
the
first
carrier
who
deals
directly
with
the
shipper.
if
you
look
at
the
venue
provision
you
can
see
that
the
statute
uses
the
term
"originating
carrier"
interchangeably
with
"receiving
carrier",
and
it
provides
venue
over
that
carrier
only
at
the
point
of
origin
of
the
shipment.
that
would
make
absolutely
no
sense
if
someone
downstream
could
be
the
receiving
carrier.
in
this
circumstance
you
would
say,
i
suppose,
that
union
pacific
was
the
receiving
carrier.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
that's
not
quite
correct,
your
honor.
historically,
as
this
court
explained
in
atlantic
coast
line
v.
riverside
mills
and
in
the
ward
case,
the
purpose
of
carmack
was
to
require
through
transportation,
a
through
bill
of
lading,
from
the
originating
point
to
the
destination
point,
a
single
bill
of
lading
under
consistent
terms,
so
that
the
shipper
does
not
have
to
prove
where
damage
occurred.
the
point
of
carmack--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--on--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--on
any
transportation,
actually,
your
honor.
the
way
that
the
statute
works,
it
can--
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
that
provision
was
introduced
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920.
it's
talking
about
domestic
water
carriers.
and
it's
still
there
in
the
statute.
it's
just
in
the
carmack
provision
when
congress
split
carmack
into
three
in
1995
it
moved
that
provision
to
14706(c)(2).
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
in
domestic
--
congress
drew
a
distinction
between
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
for
a
very
long
time,
your
honor.
in
domestic
commerce
the
rule
has
been
that
a
rail
carrier
could
interconnect
with
a
domestic
water
carrier
and
the
a
domestic
water
carrier
could
carry
it
for
a
leg
of
the
trip.
and
the
whole
trip
would
still
be
governed
by
the
carmack
through
bill
of
lading.
but
if
there
was
damage
during
the
water
portion,
it
would
be
governed
by
the
water
law,
which
was
the
harter
act.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
the
railroad
is
liable
on
a
through
transportation
basis
for
the
entire
trip,
but
if
the
damage
occurred
during
the
water
leg
its
liability
is
limited
and
confined
by
the
law
that
governs
the
water
leg.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
congress
made
that
compromise,
because
congress
was
forced
to
choose
between
not
having
through
bills
of
lading
at
all
domestically
or
making
--
or
essentially
repealing
the
harter
act
in
circumstances
where
rail
carriers
interact
with
them.
congress
made
the
choice
to
compromise
and
have
kind
of
a
hybrid
arrangement.
but
in
foreign
trade
--
the
geographics
of
carmack
was
always
confined,
that
carmack
did
not
apply
to
imports
at
all
and
it
did
not
apply
to
exports
except
for
exports
to
adjacent
foreign
countries.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
interpreted
language
of
that
nature.
but
in
a
different
context
with
a
much
weaker
statutory
language,
the
fourco
glass
line
of
cases,
this
court
applies
a
strong
thumb
on
the
scale
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
change
the
law.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
read
the
statute
in
a
countertextual
way.
you
just
have
to
do
what
this
court
has
always
done
and
read
the
statute
as
a
whole,
including
giving
some
weight
to
that
provision
which
is
in
the
text
of
the
statute
and
reading
the
rest
of
the
statute
in
light
of
it.
and
i
think
if
you
do
that,
particularly
in
this
case,
it's
really
not
that
hard
to
reconcile
the
pre-1978
law
with
the
current
law.
union
pacific
cannot
be
a
receiving
carrier
because
it
didn't
receive
the
goods
at
the
point
of
origin.
"k"
line
isn't
a
rail
carrier.
that's
enough
to
resolve
this
case
and
this
court
doesn't
need
to
go
any
farther.
actually
that
would
as
a
practical
matter
mostly
resolve
the
commercial
problem
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
resolve.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
not
exactly,
your
honor,
because
of
course
respondent's
position
is
that
carmack
is
a
mandatory
regime;
there
is
no
way
to
contract
around
it
if
it
applied.
so
respondent's
position
is
that
carmack
mandatorily
must
govern
the
inland
leg
of
any
of
these
through
shipments.
the
practical
consequence
of
that
is
that
true
through
bills
of
lading,
unity
of
responsibility
in
one
shipper
under
consistent
terms
for
the
entire
voyage
will
become
impossible
in
foreign
trade.
so
there
won't
be
a
way
to
correct
that.
mr.
j.
scott
ballenger
thank
you,
your
honor.
even
respondents
can't
really
bring
themselves
to
say
that
union
pacific
is
the
receiving
carrier
here.
it's
obviously
not.
they
say
that
somehow,
up
could
be
liable
as
the
delivering
carrier
under
carmack.
but
of
course,
if
"k"
line
is
not
a
rail
carrier,
there
is
no
receiving
carrier
who
is
obligated
to
issue
a
bill
of
lading
under
carmack.
no
one
is
allowed
to
under
carmack.
that
is
how
the
statute
always
worked,
from
1906
to
1978.
if
the
receiving
carrier
was
not
governed
by
carmack,
as
it
was
not
in
any
import
case
and
in
any
export
case
except
for
canada
and
mexico,
then
carmack
did
not
apply
to
anyone.
you
can't
parachute
in
midstream
into
the
middle
of
a
big
movement
and
impose
carmack's
obligations
at
the
midpoint,
because
that
would
turn
the
historic
purpose
of
carmack
completely
upside
down.
it
would
read
carmack
as
mandating
the
commercial
problem
that
carmack
was
designed
to
solve.
the
point
of
carmack
and
the
through
bills
under
carmack
and
cogsa
is
uniformity
of
responsibility
under
consistent
terms
for
the
whole
voyage
in
one
person.
and
the
reason
is
that
in
order
to
recover
from
anyone,
the
shipper
has
to
prove
receipt
of
the
goods
in
good
condition
by
that
carrier,
and
if
you
break
the
chain
of
the
through
bill,
then
you
would
have
to
prove
--
the
shippers
would
have
to
prove
that
union
pacific,
for
instance,
received
the
property
in
good
order,
when
as
respondents
concede,
all
that
union
pacific
gets
is
a
sealed
container.
it
has
no
idea
at
that
point.
and
--
and
so
the
shipper
would
be
left
in
a
position
at
the
end
of
the
day;
it
opens
the
container,
there's
damage;
no
one
knows
where
it
occurs;
and
there
is
--
there
is
no
source
of
law,
no
source
of
facts
to
figure
out
where
the
damage
occurred.
respondents
raise
a
lot
of
questions
about
some
track
that
they
say
"k"
line
owns
from
long
beach
to
los
angeles.
none
of
this
is
in
the
record,
and
it's
waived
at
this
point,
your
honors.
it's
not
actually
true,
that's
not
"k"
line;
it's
an
affiliate;
and
they
don't
provide
rail
transportation,
it's
a
union
pacific
subsidiary
that
provides
the
rail
transportation.
but
the
real
point
is
that
all
of
this
is
far
too
late.
this
case
was
decided
on
a
rule
12(b)(3)
motion
to
dismiss
for
improper
venue,
and
the
lower
courts
have
made
clear,
sensibly,
that
if
you
are
confronted
