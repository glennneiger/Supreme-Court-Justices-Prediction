justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
question,
and
i
know
that
your
white
light
is
on.
can
i
assume
that
whether
we
rule
for
petitioners
or
respondents
in
this
case,
the
shipping
world,
the
cargo
world,
will
immediately
adjust
to
our
decision?
it's
not
going
to
be
a
problem.
there
are
insurers,
there
are
freight
forwarders,
there
are
form
contracts.
people
will
know
exactly
what
to
--
they
will
adjust
in
1
week
to
what
we
do.
am
i
right
about
that?
or
can
you
say
that
if
we
adopt
the
respondent's
position
it
will
be
disruptive
to
the
shipping
trade
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
--
how
does
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
work
with
the
language
of
the
statute?
they
--
it
just
goes
to
los
angeles
and
it
--
there
is
a
railroad
track
right
by
--
by
the
wharf,
and
it's
the
union
pacific
railroad.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
these
cases,
cargo
owners
wanted
to
ship
goods
from
china
to
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
destinations
where
points
in
the
midwest.
to
arrange
the
shipment
the
cargo
owners
contracted
with
“k”
line.
now
“k”
line
operates
ocean
vessels
and
the
documents
the
parties
use
for
the
shipment,
documents
they
sign
with
“k”
line
cover
the
shipment
from
china
to
the
final
delivery
point
in
the
united
states
and
that’s
why
they
are
called
through
bills
of
lading.
the
bill
of
lading
is
for
the
entire
journey.
to
complete
the
shipment
in
the
united
states,
“k”
line
subcontracted
with
union
pacific
railroad
company,
so
after
the
“k”
line
shipped
the
goods
in
one
of
its
own
vessels
from
the
china
to
california,
it
then
transferred
the
cargo
to
union
pacific.
union
pacific
began
the
rail
segment
of
the
shipment
but
the
cargo
was
allegedly
destroyed
when
the
chained
train
derailed
in
oklahoma.
the
cargo
owners
sued,
they
sued
in
a
california
court.
“k”
line
and
union
pacific
said,
well
you
can't
bring
the
suit
in
california
because
there
is
a
bill
of
lading
and
the
bill
of
lading
says
that
through
the
bill
of
lading
says
that
you
must
sue
in
japan.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
ruled
for
“k”
line
and
the
union
pacific.
it
held
the
suit
had
to
be
dismissed
because
the
tokyo,
japan,
forum
selection
clause
was
enforceable.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
it
concluded
that
a
federal
statute
which
is
known
as
the
carmack
amendment,
applicable
to
railroads
applies
to
the
domestic
inland
leg
of
an
international
shipment
under
a
through
bill
of
lading
and
the
carmack
amendment
would
override
the
tokyo
forum-selection
clause
that’s
because
carmack
specifies
that
suits
must
be
brought
in
specific
locations
in
the
united
states.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
carmack
amendment
does
apply
to
the
domestic
inland
leg
of
this
shipment?
we
conclude
that
it
does
not.
carmack
only
applies
if
a
rail
carrier
is
required
to
issue
its
own
bill
of
lading
and
carmack
only
requires
that
a
receiving
rail
carrier
issue
their
own
bills
of
lading.
all
that
means
is,
all
this
means
is
the
we
have
to
decide
whether
union
pacific
was
a
receiving
carrier
and
we
hold
that
it
was
not,
that
is
because
the
cargo
had
been
first
delivered
to
“k”
line
and
it
was
not
a
rail
carrier
covered
by
carmack.
if
carmack’s
bill
of
lading
rules
refer
to
any
rail
carrier
that
in
the
colloquial
sense
received
the
property
from
another
carrier,
then
every
carrier
during
the
shipment
would
have
to
issue
its
own
separate
bill
of
lading.
this
would
be
altogether
contrary
to
carmack’s
purpose
of
making
the
receiving
and
delivering
carriers
liable
for
any
damages
under
single
initial
bill
of
lading.
indeed,
this
wouldn’t
affect
outlaw
through
shipments
under
single
bill
of
lading
in
circumstances
like
this.
now
whether
text
of
a
statute
permits
congressional
enactment
should
be
construed
to
be
consistent
with
one
another
and
the
opinion
points
out
that
the
interpretation
of
carmack
that
the
court
now
adopts,
attains
the
most
consistency
between
carmack
and
a
second
federal
statute,
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act,
that
statute
is
known
as
cogsa
and
cogsa
applies
of
its
own
force
only
to
ocean
carriage
but
the
statute
explicitly
states
the
parties
can
extend
cogsa’s
terms
by
contract,
that
is
what
the
parties
did
here.
cogsa
unlike
carmack
would
allow
the
tokyo
forum-selection
clause.
the
court
gives
practical
reasons
in
support
of
its
statutory
construction
and
in
some
because
the
journey
here
included
no
receiving
rail
carrier
that
was
required
to
issue
bill
of
ladings
under
carmack.
that
statute
does
not
apply.
the
parties’
agreement
to
litigate
these
cases
in
tokyo
is
binding.
the
cargo
owners
must
abide
by
the
contracts
they
made.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
