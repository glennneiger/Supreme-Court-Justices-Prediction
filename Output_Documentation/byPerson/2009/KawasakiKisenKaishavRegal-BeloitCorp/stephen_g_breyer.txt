justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
the
language?
the
--
if
it
helps
with
justice
scalia's
question,
the
language
says
"a
rail
carrier
providing
transportation
or
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
stb
shall
issue
a
receipt
or
bill
of
lading
for
property
it
receives.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
that's
what
it
has
to
do.
it's
a
bill
of
lading
for
property
it
receives.
and
you
are
saying
"receives"
means
receives
from
the
shipper.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
not
mean
receives
from
another
carrier.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
--
is
there
a
way
to
--
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
even
get
into
this
problem
if
--
unless
the
ship
line
is
a
rail
carrier?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
says
"a
rail
carrier
providing
transportation
or
service
subject
to
the
stb
shall
issue
a
receipt
or
a
bill
of
lading.
"
that's
what
leads
us
into
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
mid-carriage
--
it
only
talks
about
--
they
use
that
word
"received".
that's
why
i
thought
possibly
it
didn't
because
it
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
a
separate
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
the
ninth
circuit
pass
on
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
the
ninth
circuit
pass
on
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
did
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
not
right
in
front
of
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
quite
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
under
that
view,
i
guess
that
--
that
any
intermodal
transport,
china,
all
the
goods
coming
from
china,
which
tend
to
move
under
a
single
bill
of
lading,
as
soon
as
they
get
to
the
united
states
and
go
on
a
train
for
50
miles
a
new
bill
of
lading
must
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
issue--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
if
they
don't
have
to
issue
a
separate
receipt,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
bill
of
lading
that
was
issued
by
the
ship.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
that's
correct
and
if
the
ship
--
the
only
one
that
has
to
do
that,
it
says,
is
a
rail
carrier,
and
a
rail
carrier
is
a
person
providing
common
carrier
rail
transport.
and
then
that's
defined
to
include
intermodal
equipment
used
by
or
in
connection
with
a
railroad.
and
my
understanding,
which
i'm
asking
you
for
correction
--
is
that
the
argument
here
is
the
ship
is
providing
intermodal
equipment
used
by
or
in
connection
with
a
railroad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
the
words
"used
by
or
in
connection
with.
"
that
i
am
focusing
on,
because
to
apply
those
words
here
seems
to
me
to
bring
every
international
shipment
in
the
world,
no
matter
how
small
the
american
portion
by
rail
and
no
matter
how
big
the
foreign
part
of
this
transport,
it
brings
it
all
within
carmack.
and
it
means
that
the
bill
of
ladings
issued
by
people
throughout
the
world
are
all
going
to
have
to
apply
to
meet
the
terms
of
the
carmack
amendment,
which
had
the
purpose
of
railroads
in
the
united
states,
and
that's
going
to
be
a
nightmare.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
first,
is
it
true
what
i
said?
and
second,
if
it
is
true
why
isn't
it
way
contrary
to
purpose
and
a
nightmare?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
don't
they
have
to
issue
a
bill
of
lading?
that's
what
they
say.
so
every
company,
the
finnish
company,
chinese,
every
company,
every
shipowner,
even
if
you've
never
have
been
to
the
united
states
--
sad
for
him,
but
nonetheless
--
if
every
one
of
those
is
going
to
have
to
issue
a
bill
of
lading,
whatever,
meeting
whatever
requirements
are
there,
and
we
know
at
least
one
requirement
you
think
applies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
point
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it
creates
such
difficulty,
why
were
the
railroads
in
favor
of
it
before?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anything
here
that
says
on
land?
anything
in
carmack
that
says
on
land?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
if
it's
in
a
ferry
boat?
remember,
we
have
a
very
broad
definition
of
"rail"
where
"rail"
includes
all
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
rail.
so
now
we
have
got
that
broad
definition,
and
i
would
have
thought
we
through
what
has
to
be
in
the
receipt
and
then
we
get
to
the
--
that
section
and
where
it's
exempt,
because
they
got
--
want
to
get
rid
of
it;
then
you
have
to
put
in
--
you
have
to
put
in
a
certain
kind
of
waiver,
which
is
very
hard
to
achieve.
and
that
--
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
they
can't
get
rid
of
the
thing
you
like.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
do
they
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
two
things
here
i
don't
understand.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
clear.
in
the
first
part,
706(a),
it
talks
about
--
in
the
definition
of
"rail
carrier".
102-6,
i
guess
--
it
says
railroad
includes
--
railroad
transport
will
include
intermodal
connect
--
intermodal
equipment
transport
used
in
connection
with
a
railroad.
what
is
intermodal
equipment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
now,
if
we
read
it
literally,
to
go
back
to
my
--
i'm
trying
to
produce
the
worst
example
that
frightens
me
the
most.
there
is
three
miles
of
railroad
transport
in
the
united
states,
but
it
carries
the
chassis,
or
it
carries
that
big
box,
which
has
come
all
over
the
world,
from
all
over
the
world.
and
if
we
read
this
with
no
limitation,
this
definition
makes
ships
that
carried
it
from
other
places,
railroads,
and
once
that's
railroad
transportation,
we
are
into
carmack.
and
now,
if
stb
exempts
it,
what
happens
is
the
provision
comes
into
play
that
says
you
can't
exempt
an
exempt
carrier,
in
effect,
from
the
liability
provision.
and
it
means
the
ships
that
had
to
issue
the
bill
of
lading
now
have
to
allow
the
kinds
of
suits
--
now,
here
is
the
point
i'm
not
certain
about
--
i
would
think
against
them,
not
just
against
a
railroad
carrier,
and
perhaps
against
them
for
anything
that
happens,
even
on
the
ocean,
and
not
just
the
railroad
carrier
for
something
that
happens
within
the
united
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
explain
to
me:
what
is
it
that
gets
us
out
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
where
does
it
say
that?
because
i
better
read
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
where?
do
you
know
--
do
you
know
offhand
where
it
says
that,
just
so
i
can--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
cogsa.
that's
not
carmack.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
gets
us
out
of
carmack?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
are
we
suing
--
why
are
we
suing
--
why
does
the
ship
being
sued
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
go
back
one
more
second?
can
you
just
give
me
the
citation
in
carmack
--
not
cogsa,
but
carmack
--
that
would
get
our
intermodal
shipment
out
of
the
board's
jurisdiction?
because
what
i'm
thinking
about
is
the
intermodal
shipment
and
the
boat
sinks
near
hawaii.
okay?
now,
on
your
reading
of
carmack,
not
cogsa,
what
gets
that
shipment
sunk
in
hawaii
--
or
midway
or
guam
or
someplace
--
what
gets
them
out
of
carmack?
which
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
includes
transport
just
as
you
defined
it
between
the
united
states
and
another
place
--
united
states
and
a
place
in
a
foreign
country.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
what
this
is.
this
is
a
shipment
between
shanghai
and
san
francisco.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
sorry,
between
a
place
in
--
oh,
transportation
in
the
united
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
between
a
place
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
--
how
do
you
get
out
of
the
language
that
says
that
a
rail
carrier
providing
transportation
shall
issue
a
receipt
for
property
it
receives?
now
the
boat,
oddly
enough,
is
a
rail
carrier
under
the
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore,
it
should
have
issued
--
since
you
agree
it's
the
receiving
character,
it
should
have
--
it
should
have
issued
a
--
a
bill
of
lading,
that
then,
if
it's
within
carmack
as
i've
just
tried
to
put
it,
requires
it
to
have
certain
things
in
it
that
they
say
aren't
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right;
and
now
we
see
a
rail
carrier;
we've
got
the
definition
there;
and
it
includes
somebody
who
provides
intermodal
equipment
and
you
look
at
transportation
and
transportation
includes
services
related
to
that
equipment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
now
all
right.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
now
just
give
me
how
--
what
i
would
write
in
the
opinion
that
would
in
fact
--
because
what
they
did
here,
the
ship,
is
it
took
the
container
and
put
it
on
the
train.
okay?
so
that's
interservice
equipment.
what's
the
language
that
does
it
your
way?
