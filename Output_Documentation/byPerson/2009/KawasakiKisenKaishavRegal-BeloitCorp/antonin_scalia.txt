yes,
but
not
--
not
every
--
where
you
are
dealing
with
--
with
intermodal
transportation,
not
every
receiving
--
not
every
rail
carrier
would
be
the
receiving
rail
carrier.
i
mean,
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
client
is
the
first
rail
carrier
to
receive,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
what
--
what
are
you
referring
to
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
--
why
doesn't
the
(2),
(a)(2),
the
delivering
rail
carrier
--
if
what
you
say
is
true,
that
should
be
the
delivering
rail
carrier
delivering
in
a
--
in
an
adjacent
foreign
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that
limitation
is
strangely
missing
from
(2).
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
wait
a
minute
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
paragraphing
you
say
is
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
--
you
are
saying
that
--
i
think
what
you
are
saying
is
that
all
we
have
to
use
the
statutory
statement
that
"nothing
was
meant
to
be
changed
or.
"
is
to
say,
well,
that
paragraphing
in
3
is
just
wrong,
right?

i'm
losing
you.
73a?
justice
antonin

rail
carrier.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
you
arguing,
estoppel?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
one
is
right?
that's
what
we
are
concerned
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
one
is
right?
their
earlier
position
or
their
current
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
speak
to
that
rather
than
the
fact
that
they
had
an
earlier
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
you
say
we
have
to
defer
to
a
letter
brief
in
another
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
most
of
my
colleagues
would
not
defer
to
a
letter
brief
in
this
case.
and
you
are
saying
that
we
owe
deference
to
a
letter
brief
in
another
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
i
didn't
agree
with,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
another
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
that
case.
do
we
have
a--
brief
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
--
about
whether
--
whether
the
shipper
becomes
a
rail
carrier?
suppose
it's
not
three
to
five
miles.
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
american
rail
carrier
is
waiting
right
at
the
foot
of
the
wharf.
all
these
wharfs
have
rails
that
go
out
to
the
ship,
okay?
and
let's
assume
that
that's
owned
by
the
shipping
company.
and
a
crane
takes
the
--
the
goods
off
of
the
ship,
puts
it
on
a
--
on
a
car
that
rides
along
those
rails
for
a
couple
of
hundred
yards.
is
that
enough
to
make
the
shipper
a
railroad?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
here
they
own
rail
lines
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
go
for--
