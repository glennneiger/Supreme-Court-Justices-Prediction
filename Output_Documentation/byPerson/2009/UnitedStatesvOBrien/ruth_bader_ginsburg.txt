justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
life
part
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
the
substantive
crime
was?
is
it
the
attempted
robbery
or
whatever
it
was?
is
that
--
because
this
is
--
you're
--
you're
saying
this
is
an
add-on
to
an
underlying
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
--
then
you
wouldn't
be
relying
on
what
might
be
a
life
sentence
for
the
underlying
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
where
do
you
get
the
maximum?
you
say,
oh,
these
are
just
minimums.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
where
is
--
where
is
the
maximum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
can't
we
just
say,
as
judge
boudin
did,
they
weren't
--
this
revision
was
on
the
books
before
castillo
was
decided,
so
obviously
congress
wasn't
trying
to
adjust
the
statute
in
response
to
castillo.
and
they
--
they
made
it
read
more
easily.
we
know
the
one
thing
congress
was
concerned
with
was
adding
possession,
which
was
not
there
before.
so
they
added
possession.
they
made
it
more
readable.
some
of
the
concerns
that
were
expressed
in
castillo
are
certainly
present
here.
there
is
a
huge
jump
from
a
5-year
add-on
to
a
30-year
add-on
for
--
for
the
machinegun.
so
why
don't
we
just
say,
well,
this
statute
has
been
revised,
but
it
wasn't
in
response
to
castillo?
it's
not
all
that
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
short
--
what
is
it,
the
one
that
gets
10
years,
the
short-barreled
rifle?
that's
--
that's
--
those
two
are
together
in
the
statute,
and
you
said
that
it
would
be
startling
because
of
the
difference
between
10
years
and
the
30
years,
but
the
short-barreled
rifle
is
the
same
amount
of
time
in
discharging,
and
discharging
is
a
sentencing
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
they
have
to
because
that's
what
harris
said,
brandished--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--brandished
is
a
sentencing
factor.
