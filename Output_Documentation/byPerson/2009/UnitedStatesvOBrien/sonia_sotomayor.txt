no,
but
you're
forgetting
the
words
of
this
subsection.
i
mean--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
subsection
would
be
(b)
itself.
if
you're
convicted
of
carrying
a
machinegun,
you
get
--
i'm
sorry
--
a
short-barrel
rifle,
et
cetera,
you
get
10
years.
if
it's
a
machinegun,
you
get
30.
what's
--
what's
irrational
about
reading
the
statute
that
way
when
it
uses
the
word
"subsection"?
it
didn't
use
"subparagraph".
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
didn't.
it
kept
in
(a)
the
subdivisions
of
use
and
brandishing,
which
we
all
agree
are
elements
of
the
crime.
so
i
don't
know
what
it
means
to
say
that
it
moved
it
away
from
the
elements.
it
mixed
up
in
(a)
elements
and
sentencing
factors,
and
so
what
we
have
to
discern
was,
did
it
intend
to
make
(b)
sentencing
factors
or
not?
and
i
think
what
justice
breyer
was
asking
you:
what
in
the
legislative
history
shows
that?
where
do
we
read,
outside
of
castillo,
a
conclusion
that
somehow
congress
radically
changed
the
assumptions
we
identified
in
castillo,
which
is
historically
it's
not
a
sentencing
element?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
a
sixth
amendment
problem
with
reading
a
statute
this
way,
with
--
with
reading
a
statute
to
provide
for
an
unlimited
maximum
when
congress
hasn't
specified
it,
and
now
you're
going
to
have
the
judge
find
the
minimum
and
the
maximum?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
there
a
sixth
amendment
problem
with
not
knowing
what
you
are
exposed
to?
and
then
doesn't
the
minimum
in
that
case
sort
of
become
de
facto
the
maximum?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
a
minimum
always
a
maximum?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
--
to
the
person
who
would
otherwise,
in
the
judge's
discretion,
qualify
for
a
lower
sentence,
doesn't
it
become
that
person's
maximum
once
you
have
indiscretion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
you
can
rely
on
in
an
indeterminate
sentencing
regime
without
a
minimum
is
that
you've
got
a
statutory
maximum,
whatever
it
may
be,
but
a
judge's
discretion
to
start
from
zero.
if
that
judge
was
inclined
to
give
you
zero,
isn't
the
minimum
then
your
statutory
maximum?
you're
--
because
that's
what
the
judge
has
to
give
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
we
find
it
with
this
statute,
if
there's
a
10-year
minimum/maximum
under
(a)
subdivision
(iii)
if
the
firearm
is
discharged,
and
it's
10
years;
and
if
it's
a
short-barreled
rifle
under
(b),
it's
also
an
equal
amount,
of
10
years?
i
think
that's
what
justice
ginsburg
was
pointing
to.
so
the
question
i
have
for
you
is:
how
do
we
find
substantive
unreasonableness?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
unreasonableness,
that
there
was
an
act
of
manipulation
here,
or
intent
to
manipulate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
