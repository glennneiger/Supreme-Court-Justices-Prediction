mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
924(c)(1)
starts
by
defining
a
single
crime
of
using
or
carrying
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence
or
a
drug
trafficking
crime.
next,
it
addresses
sentencing,
and
it
does
that
by
giving
the
judge
some
rules
to
channel
his
discretion
in
particular
cases,
and
among
those
is
a
requirement
that
a,
quote,
"person
convicted
of
a
violation".
"shall
be
sentenced"
to
a
greater
minimum
sentence
when
the
firearm
is
of
a
particular
type.
and--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
no,
and,
of
course--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
phrase
(a)
as
well.
to
the
extent
a
statute
is
going
to
direct
a
particular
sentence,
it's
going
to
use
those
words.
but
i
think
the
--
we're
relying
a
lot
more
on
the
language
in
the
beginning
of
subparagraph
(b),
that
says,
"if
the
firearm
possessed
by
a
person
convicted
of
a
violation.
"
which
necessarily
presupposes,
then,
that
there
has
been
a
conviction--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
agree.
that's
true.
that
is
certainly
an
accurate
statement--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
certainly
don't
claim
that
they
--
that
the
elements
in
the
principal
paragraph
of
(a)
are.
the
point
i'm
--
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that,
with
respect
to
firearm
type,
which
is
at
issue
here,
is
that
the
firearm
type
provisions
are
introduced
by
specific
language
that
says
--
that
tells
the
reader
these
are
relevant
to
a
person
convicted
of
a
violation;
these
are
not
relevant
to
whether--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
agree
it
doesn't
use
"subparagraph".
and
924(c)
as
a
whole.
but
--
but
looking
to
the
word
"this
subsection",
justice
sotomayor,
is
not
--
is
not
useful
for
distinguishing
among
the
elements
and
the
sentencing
factors,
because
of
course
there
are,
i
think
--
certainly
this
court's
holding
in
harris
says
that
the
brandishing
and
the
discharge
provisions
are
sentencing
factors.
they
are
part
of
this
subsection.
all
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held,
and
it's
the
entirely
natural
inference
of
the
recidivism
provisions
in
subparagraph
(c),
which
is
also
part
of
this
subsection,
are
--
are
themselves
sentencing
factors.
so
saying
that
something
is
in
this
subsection
means
that
it
might
be
part
of
a
violation
doesn't
actually
answer
what
is
or
is
not
part
of
the
violation
versus--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that
--
that
i
think
would
be
so
precise
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
discussing
it
today.
i
agree
with
that.
but,
of
course,
congress
has
also
used
that
same
reference
to
(c),
it
appears
in
subparagraph
(d),
which
is
not--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--which
is
not
then
to
say
that
this
subsection
--
that
everything
in
this
subsection
is
an
element.
the
court
has
held
otherwise
already.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
that
certainly
would
be
the
inference.
and
that
would
be
quite
contrary
to
the
traditional
treatment
of
recidivism.
but,
more
generally,
the
tradition
that
congress
is
working
within
in
this
new
statute
--
which,
i
want
to
point
out,
is
significantly
different
in
--
in
a
very
substantive
way
from
the
old
statute
--
that
the
new
statute
proscribes
a
statutory
maximum
of
life
in
all
cases.
that
is
different
from
the
old
statute.
the
old
statute--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
several
specific
changes
that
congress
made.
and
i
think
it
would
be,
perhaps,
useful
to
look
at
the
old
statute
and
the
new
one,
the
old
statute
and
the
new
one
together
and
see
why
the
things
that
--
that
the
court
said
in
castillo
are
gone
in
the
new
one.
so
the
old
statute
is
in
the
petition
appendix
at
11a.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
and
then
the
new
statute
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
opening
brief
at
1a
and
2a,
so
you
can
look
at
them
side
by
side.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it
is.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it
is,
although,
of
course,
you
have
to
turn
the
page,
and
i--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--perhaps
it's
helpful
to
look
at
them
next
to
each
other,
because
the
differences
are
quite
stark--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--when
you
do
that.
so
the
first
thing
is,
as
you
suggested,
justice
breyer,
the
firearm
type
provisions
were
moved.
but
i
think
that
that
move
signals
something
contrary
to
what
this
court
had
perceived
in
castillo.
in
castillo,
the
firearm
type
provisions
were
part
of
the
initial
sentence
that
defined
the
elements.
the
sentence
is
rolling
along,
talking
about
using
or
carrying
a
firearm,
and
then
in
the
same
breath
it
goes
on
to
start
talking
about
specific
weapons.
and
that
is
what,
in
my
reading
of
castillo,
drove
the
court's
impression
that
the
they
--
that
the
machinegun
provision
there
should
be
an
element.
the
difference
in
the
new
statute
is
--
is
that
congress
has
moved
it
away,
textually,
conceptually,
structurally,
away
from
the
elements,
which
ought
to
suggest
that
congress
doesn't
think--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--so
a
few
answers
there.
first
of
all,
in
the
new
--
in
the
new
structure
of
the
statute,
on
the
government's
view,
the
elements
finish
in
the
principal
paragraph,
and
then
--
then
we're
into
sentencing
factors.
so
brandishing
and
discharge
were
held
in
harris
and
acknowledged
in
dean
to
be
sentencing
factors.
so
we
are
sort
of,
at
that
point,
on
to
sentencing
factors.
so
i
take
from
what
this
court
said
in
harris,
about
the
separation
of
brandishing
and
discharge
from
the
elements
in
the
principal
paragraph
to
indicate
that
they
are
sentencing
factors,
would
apply
even
more
strongly
to
subparagraph
(c),
which
is
even
farther
away.
there's
--
there's
a
period,
a
structural
break,
a
new
sentence.
the
thought
in
the
principal
paragraph
is
certainly
complete.
we've
already
been
through
some
other
sentencing
factors,
and
now
we're--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
because
the
tradition,
as
i
understand
it,
is
relevant
because
it
might
indicate
what
congress
was
thinking
or
what
suppositions
it
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
a
statute.
and
there's
a
very
--
there
was
a
very
different
tradition
at
the
time
of
the
1986
enactment
of
the
old
statute
and
the
1998
enactment
of
the
new
one,
which
is
--
the
big
difference
is
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
came
into
effect
in
between
those
two
times.
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
--
sentencing
guideline
2k2.1,
the
principal
determinant
of
base
offense
level
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
for
firearm-centric
offenses
in
the
federal
criminal
law,
was
firearm
type.
so
it
was
unmistakably
that
--
it
was
unmistakable
at
the
time
in
1998
when
congress
enacted
these
--
these
firearm-type
provisions,
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
already
making
firearm
type
a
sentencing
consideration
for
the
judge.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
the
guidelines
--
as
before
and
as
now
for
this
offense,
the
guidelines
level
is
the
minimum.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i'm
sorry.
and
your
--
if
i
understand
you--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--a
reasonable
--
well,
certainly
courts
have,
since
booker,
imposed
even
up
to
a
life
sentence
for
offenses
that
did
not
otherwise
trigger
the
elevated
minimums.
there's
at
least
one
case
in
the
few
years
since
booker
that
implied
a
--
that
imposed
a
life
sentence
for
a
--
for
an
offense
that
would
have
been
subject
only
to
the
base
5-year
maximum.
there
are
several
that
imposed
--
imposed
a
life
sentence
for--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--the
--
the
maximum
is
not
textually
in
the
statute,
but
all
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
have
understood
that.
certainly,
it
seems
to
be
the
supposition
of
this
court's
statutory
holding
in
harris
that
the
nature
of
--
the
structure
of
this
--
of
the
sentencing
provision
here
is
that
there's
a
life
maximum,
and
then
the
firearm--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
it
is
certainly
the
case,
if
we
simply
take
(a)(1)--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
absolutely
disagree.
if
it
says
"at
least",
that
can
only
mean
that
there
can
be
some
--
a
sentence
higher
than
that.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
or
not
less
than.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
wouldn't
describe
it
as
an
add-on.
it
is
a
separate
federal
crime,
in
--
in
the
sense
--
in
the
sense
that
it
is
bad
enough
and
dangerous
enough
to
commit
a
drug
trafficking
offense
or
engage
in
a
crime
of--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
may
have
--
may
have
misspoken.
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
my
answer
--
my
answer
was
directed
to
imposing
a
life
sentence
on
the
924(c)
conviction,
separate
from
whatever
sentence
may
have
been
imposed
on
the--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
they
are
minimums
because
they
say
5
years>
["].
that
applies--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--the
--
well,
because
there
is
no
stated
maximum,
the
--
the
assumption
then
must
be
that
a
sentence
higher
than
5
years
is
appropriate.
there
is
no--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
don't
--
i
disagree
that
the
judge
is
finding
the
maximum.
the
--
the
implied
maximum
term
here
is
--
is
life.
congress--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
the
trouble,
justice
scalia,
is
then
that
i
don't
otherwise
know
what
the
maximum
would
be.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
maximum--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
sense
to
treat
them,
as
you
are
describing
them,
as
add-ons.
there's
no
question
that
this
--
that
this
statute
defines
an
offense
that
someone
can
be
convicted
of.
that
certainly
is
the
implication
of
this
court's
holding
in
deal.
it
is
a
separate
offense
which
therefore
should
carry
its
own
punishment.
and
the
contrast--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
then
to
compare
this
to
the
--
the
language
of
the
prior
statute,
which
describes
exactly
what
you
are
describing.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
which
is
--
which
is
that
whoever
during
or
in
relation,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
uses
or
carries
a
firearm--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i'm
sorry,
this
is
at
11a
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
or
3a
of
the
--
of
the
government's
--
the
government's
brief.
the
old
statute
said
exactly
what
you
are
describing,
justice
scalia,
which
is
that
whoever
during
or
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence,
et
cetera,
uses
or
carries
a
firearm
shall,
in
addition
to
the
punishment
provided
for
such
crime
of
violence,
et
cetera
--
and
then
it
specifies--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--particular
determinate
sentences.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
if
congress
had
wanted
to
continue
that
approach,
i
assume
it
would
have
kept
that
language.
it
didn't.
it
changed
the
language.
the
new
language
says
"be
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
not
less
than
5
years.
"
which
leaves
--
which
leaves--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that
--
i
understand
that
language,
the
in
--
the
"in
addition
to"
language,
to
have
--
to
have
been
to
make
clear
that
this
is
a
separate
offense.
there
is
separate
punishment
for
a
separate
conviction
of
this
separate
offense.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
and
that
then
it
is
a
separate
--
then
from
there
it
is
a
question
what
is
the
appropriate
sentence
for
a
conviction
on
the
offense
described
in
924(c)(1),
which
is
to
say,
well,
it's
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
not
less
than
5
years,
which
holds
open--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
--
i
agree.
and
if
you
look
in
subparagraph
(d)(ii)
it
says
that
the
term
of
imprisonment
imposed
under
this
subsection
shall
run
consecutive
to
the
other
one,
which
--
which
again
shows
that
--
that
the
considerations
for
sentencing
in
this
--
in
this
law
are
distinct
from
the
--
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
separate
question
what
the
sentence
on
the
924(c)--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
to
answer
--
well,
first
of
all,
there
certainly
has
not
been
in
--
in
the
briefing
or
argument
here,
any
opportunity
for
this
court
to
consider
what
it
would
need
to
consider
to
overrule
mcmillan.
we're
not
talking
about
overruling
harris.
we're
talking
about
overruling
mcmillan.
and--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
and
that's
--
and
that
would
be
my
--
my
second
point,
is
that
--
is
that
since
--
i
think
it
has
been
become
clearer
since
harris
that
the
rule
in
mcmillan
and
the
rule
in
apprendi
coexist
quite
well
and
coexist
in
a
principled
fashion,
and
that
there
is
--
and
that
there
is
no
--
harris
was
correct
in
light
of
apprendi,
which
is
--
which
is
in
the
following
respect.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
yes,
we
would
certainly
want
to
set
it
for
reargument--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--obviously.
[laughter]
but
--
but
i
--
again,
i
don't
even
think
that's
necessary.
respondents
have
offered
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
justification
for
overruling
harris.
and
again,
the
distinction
is--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
disagree
that
it's
not
all
that
different.
and
--
and
for
the
following
three
--
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
setting
aside
my
disagreement
with
justice
scalia,
if
you
accept
that
the
statutory
maximum
is
life,
as
i
believe
every
court
to
have
confronted
this
understands
it
to
be,
then
this
statute
belongs
to
an
entirely
different
tradition
than
the
tradition
that
castillo
belonged
to,
which
is
to
say
that
this
statute
--
the
--
the
role
of
firearm
type
in
this
statute
is
to
channel
the
sentencing
judge's
discretion
by
ruling
out
certain
low
sentences
when
certain
facts
are
present,
such
as
the
presence
of
a
machinegun.
that
is
something
that
when
congress
wants
to
channel--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--no,
i--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
disagree
with
that
because
the
principle
--
the
background
--
the
basic
principle
behind
apprendi
and
our
criminal
law
is
that
what
you
can
rely
on
is
what
congress
has
said
in
the
statute
or
in
--
as
booker
holds--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
disagree
with
that,
because
it
is
not
the
only
thing
the
judge
can
give
you.
the
full
range
of
punishment
above
those
minimums
is
available.
i
was
indicating
earlier
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
right,
and
perhaps
only
half
of
that
one,
which
is
--
which
is
that
in
the
--
on
the
question
of
--
of
tradition,
congress
apparently
exclusively
uses
sentencing
factors
when
it
wants
to
do
nothing
more
than
give
some
rules
to
the
judge
to
channel
his
discretion
with
minimum
sentences.
we
observed
this
in
our
opening
brief,
and
respondents
said
nothing
in
response.
as
far
as
we
know,
every
time
congress
wants
to
channel
a
sentencing
judge's
discretion,
it
does
it
with
a
sentencing
factor.
that
is
a
difference.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
number
two
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
--
the
--
the
linguistic
change
here,
the
textual
change,
the
fact
that
subparagraph
(d)
says
"a
person
convicted
of
a
violation
of
this
subsection.
"
that
presupposes
there
has
been
a
conviction,
that
the
jury
has
been
charged
with
whatever
the
elements
of
the
offense
are
and
that
now
what's
going
to
be
stated
in
clauses
(b)(i)
and
(b)(ii)
are
things
that
are
relevant
at
sentencing.
and
then
the
third
--
and
then
the
third
point
is
--
is
that
--
is
essentially
the
structural
change
from
--
that
i
alluded
to
earlier,
of
moving
firearm
type
wholly
away
from
the
elements
of
the
offense.
that
made
a
difference
to
this
court
in
harris.
it
is
--
it
would
be,
i
think,
irreconcilable
with
this
court's
holding
in
harris
to
say
that
brandishing
and
discharge
have
been
moved
far
enough
away
from
the
elements
to
make
them
sentencing
factors,
or
rather
are
stated
far
enough
away
from
the
elements,
structurally
separated
enough
to
make
them
sentencing
factors,
but
then
to--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
would
agree
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
would
--
i
would
point
out
--
of
course,
one
has
to
--
one
has
to
recognize
what
congress
had
before
it
when
it
--
when
it
made
the
change,
which
is
to
say,
when
it
--
when
it
embarked
on
these
revisions,
there
was
a
one-to-one
circuit
split
on
the
question.
and
by
the
time
it
had
finished
making
the
changes,
it
was
actually
three
to
one
in
favor
of
sentencing
factor
interpretation
in
the
old
statute.
now,
i
agree
that
if
castillo
had
been
on
the
books
and
congress
had
said
nothing
about
it,
that
might
be
a
basis
to
say
that
congress
was
acquiescing
in
that
interpretation.
but
it's
--
it's
--
congress
was
certainly
concerned
with
much
more
substantial
issues
in
the
revisions.
and
the
fact
that
it
did
not
comment
further
should
not
be
a
reason
to
--
to
not
pay
attention
to
the
structural
and
textural
changes
that
it
did
make.
i'd
like
to
reserve.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
thank
you.
justice
kennedy,
just
to
answer
your
question:
the
definition
of
921(a)(3)
includes
a
weapon
that
is
designed
to
expel
a
projectile,
so
one
that
can
be
restored
to
do
so
also
qualifies
as
a
firearm
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
my
friend
made
the
comment
that
brandishing
and
discharge
would
have
been
treated,
under
the
old
statute,
as
sentencing
factors.
but
they
couldn't
be,
because
the
old
statute
had
determinant
sentences,
and
brandishing
and
discharge
weren't
relevant
to
it.
so
there
wouldn't
be
a
higher
sentence
for
those.
and
that
--
that
reveals
sort
of
a
basic
flaw
in
this
notion
that
somehow
those
can
be
treated
as
sentencing
factors,
but
congress
wasn't
embarking
on
a
general
litany
of
sentencing
factors.
congress
inserted
those
to
be
sentencing
factors,
as
the
court
recognized
in
harris.
then
what
it
did
is
move
the
firearm-type
provisions
next
in
line,
because
that's
what
it
thought
of
them
as,
not
as
elements.
it
moved
them
away.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
recidivism,
which
is
also
a
sentencing
factor.
so
the
overall
result,
then,
of
the
statute
is
that
it's
sort
of
an
instruction
manual.
the
first
thing
that
comes
up
is
the
elements;
that's
what
the
judge
uses
to
charge
the
jury
or
take
a
plea.
that
ends.
the
statute
takes
up
the
next
topic,
which
is
sentencing.
the
judge
needs
to
ascertain
the
limits
of
his
discretion.
and
then
the
statute
ends
with
some
technical
considerations.
that
--
that
approach
is
entirely
in
line
with
the
sentencing
factor
tradition,
and
that's
--
that
seems
to
be
what
congress
intended.
but
my
friend's
understanding
of
the
statute
is
sort
of
this
disorganized
jumble,
and
he's
making
very
much
of
the
idea
that
when
congress
revises
a
statute,
it
tries
to
confront
--
it
tries
to
make
it
better,
on
his
view.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
there
is
no
legislative
history,
but
there
is
the
fact
that
the
form
manual
says
if
you're
going
to
embark
on
this,
here
are
some
ideas
for
how
to
do
it.
but
it
doesn't
tell
you
--
it
does
not
tell
congress
substantively
what
it
should
do.
someone
had
to
make
a
choice
to
write
that
introductory
language,
"a
person
convicted
of
a
violation.
"
and
that
is
what
congress
passed,
and
so
congress
intended
that
those
things,
firearm
type,
that
follow
that
are
relevant
after
the
person
has
been
convicted
of
a
violation.
one
final
answer
to
your
question
justice
scalia,
about
the
life
maximum.
this
court
held
--
in
custis
v.
united
states
interpreted
the
same
language,
"not
less
than"
a
certain
number
of
years.
that's
in
924(e)
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
the
court
held
that
to
have
a
life
maximum
sentence
there.
so
i
think
the
same
would
apply
--
the
same
would
apply
here.
and
so
the
final
thing
i
would
want
the
court
to
take
away
then
from
this
is
that
congress
is
using
firearm
type
to
channel
a
sentencing
judge's
discretion.
the
life
maximum
exists
in
all
cases.
there
have
been
cases
sentenced
up
to
life
even
where
that
was
far
above
the
minimum.
and
when
congress
does
that,
it
uses
a
sentencing
factor.
it
doesn't
create
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses
for
the
jury;
it
does
it
by
addressing
the
person
who
is
in
charge
of
sentencing,
which
is
the
judge,
and
giving
him
a
rule
of
decision.
that's
what
the
text
and
the
structure
indicate
here
and
that's
what
the
court
should
hold.
thank
you.
