justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
this
to
do
--
i
mean,
the
obvious
question,
to
me,
is
--
since
i
wrote
the
--
i
think
i
wrote
the
opinion
in
castillo
--
is
we
looked
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
very
similar
to
this,
and
we
said:
machinegun
means
a
separate
crime.
and
they
recodified
it.
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
all
they
did
was
take
the
things
that
we
previously
said
were
separate
crimes
and
put
them
in
(b),
and
take
the
things
that
are
obviously
sentencing
factors
and
put
them
in
(a)
and
(c).
all
right.
now,
that's
what
it
looks
like
if
you
just
read
the
statute.
i
didn't
find
anything
in
the
history
that
suggested
any
other
intent.
so
why
do
you
think
that
that
change
makes
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
make
your
life
a
little
more
complicated
and
difficult,
though
perhaps
it
makes
it
easier,
we
reach
the
questions
that
justice
scalia
was
raising,
i
think,
and
they
are
important
only
if
you
win,
only
if
we
say
that
it
is
a
sentencing
factor.
if
it
is
a
new
crime,
we
don't
have
any
problem,
because
if
it's
a
new
crime,
the
jury
has
to
find
the
fact.
but
if
it's
a
sentencing
factor,
then
we
get
into
the
problem
of
harris
versus
apprendi.
and
then
you
have
to
decide
whether
it's
maximum,
minimum,
et
cetera.
but
in
harris,
i
said
that
i
thought
apprendi
does
cover
mandatory
minimums,
but
i
don't
accept
apprendi.
well,
at
some
point
i
guess
i
have
to
accept
apprendi,
because
it's
the
law
and
has
been
for
some
time.
so
if
and
in
fact,
unfortunately
for
everyone,
i
was
--
it
was
5-4
in
that,
i
think,
so
my
vote
mattered,
and
i
don't
know
what
other
people
think
but
in
--
on
this
court.
but
if
that
becomes
an
issue,
if
that
should
become
an
issue
about
whether
mandatory
minimums
are
treated
like
the
maximums
for
apprendi
purposes,
should
we
reset
the
case
for
argument?
or
do
you
feel,
in
your
opinion
that
--
that
you've
had
enough
of
an
argument
because
you
devoted
two
or
three
pages
to
this
topic?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
think
basically
apprendi
did
significantly
change
mcmillan,
but
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
the
government
believe
that
it
has
sufficiently
argued
this,
or
would
you
suggest
on
the
government's
behalf
that
if
it
becomes
an
issue
it's
set
for
reargument?
that
was
really
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
their
--
their
--
their
basic
argument
is
look
at
the
statute.
(a)
has
what
is
undoubtedly
a
set
of
sentencing
factors.
brandishing
and
discharging
are
as
traditional
as
they
come.
then
look
at
(c),
and
you
find
some
other
ones
that
are
sentencing
factors,
because
recidivism
is
as
traditional
as
it
comes.
and
between
those
two
they
put
(b).
so
since
the
neighbors,
(a)
and
(c),
are
certainly
sentencing,
they
must
have
meant
(b)
to
be
a
sentencing
factor,
too.
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
one
of
their
basic
arguments.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
other
--
do
we
have
anything
other
than
the
statute
itself?
when
i
looked
at
the
statute
itself,
i
thought,
well,
all
that's
happened
here
is
nobody's
thought
of
this
issue
at
all;
nobody's
read
castillo.
what
really
happened
is
somebody
in
the
legislative
drafting
section
was
focusing
on
what
he
said
they
were
focusing
on,
bailey,
and
then
they
have
a
form
manual.
so
they
followed
the
form
manual.
now,
is
there
anything
to
suggest
that
isn't
what
happened?
