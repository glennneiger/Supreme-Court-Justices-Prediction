counsel
--
counsel,
i
think
you
had
said
you
had
three
responses
to
justice
ginsburg--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
only
got
one
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
number
two?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
are
all
--
all
three
of
those
are
--
are
pretty
subtle
ways
for
congress
to
change
the
view
in
castillo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
moving
something

thank
you,

otherwise
receive

what?

he
could
otherwise
receive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
we
know
that's
a
sentencing
factor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
court's
--
the
court's
opinion
in
castillo
quite
carefully
noted
that
it
wasn't
addressing
this
statute.
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
of
a
bait-and-switch
to
say
that,
well,
castillo
decides
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
horwich,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice

our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-1569,
