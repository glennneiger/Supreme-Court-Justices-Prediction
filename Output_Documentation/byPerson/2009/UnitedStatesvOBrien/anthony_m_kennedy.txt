what's
the
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
nice
organization
here.
but
what
is
the
principle,
the
general
rule,
that
you
articulate
to
support
the
distinction
between
30
being
necessarily
an
element
and
7
a
sentencing
factor?
what's
the
general
rule
here?

other

is
that

it's
a
collateral
point:
does
the
government
have
to
show,
or
does
the
--
don't
you
have
to
find
that
the
machinegun
is
operable?
justice

in
this
case,
united
states
versus
o'brien
et
al,
the
respondents
attempted
to
rob
an
armored
car
at
gunpoint.
they
fled,
but
were
later
captured
and
charged
with
various
federal
offenses.
one
of
the
counts
in
the
indictment
charged
them
with
use
of
firearms
during
a
crime
of
violence
and
a
second
--
a
separate
count
charged
them
with
using
a
machine
gun
during
their
crime.
now
use
of
a
firearm
during
a
crime
of
violence
carries
a
five-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
but
if
a
firearm
is
a
machine
gun,
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence
is
30
years
imprisonment
and
the
dispute
here
is
this.
does
the
machine
gun
provision
of
the
controlling
statute
state
an
element
of
an
offense
to
be
established
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial
or
is
it
a
sentencing
factor
that
need
only
be
found
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
sentencing
phase?
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
ruled
that
whether
a
machine
gun
was
involved
is
an
element
of
the
offense
to
be
proved
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
the
government
disputes
this
conclusion.
the
government
contends
that
the
machine
gun
question
is
a
sentencing
factor,
so
that
the
relevant
facts
are
for
the
judge
to
determine
a
sentencing.
the
controlling
statute
is
18
u.s.c.,
section
924
(c)(1).
we've
interpreted
the
statute
before.
indeed
one
of
those
cases
castillo
versus
united
states
was
on
this
very
point,
but
the
statute
as
it
was
interpreted
--
as
castillo
was
later
amended,
so
we
found
it
necessary
to
revisit
the
matter.
castillo
was
decided
10
years
ago.
the
court
then
held
in
a
unanimous
opinion
that
the
machine
gun
provision
in
an
earlier
version
of
the
statute
was
an
element
of
the
offense.
we
reached
that
same
conclusion
here
and
we
agree
with
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
since
the
statute
has
to
be
considered
in
each
of
its
parts,
it's
appropriate
to
make
this
discussion
and
summary
even
more
brief
than
usual.
when
evaluating
the
statutory
provision
as
it
existed
in
castillo,
the
court
looked
to
five
factors
in
determining
whether
a
particular
fact
is
either
an
element
or
a
sentencing
factor.
first,
the
language
and
structure
of
the
statute;
second,
whether
the
facts
were
historically
treated
as
elements
or
sentencing
factors;
third,
the
comparative
risk
of
unfairness
accompanying
each
interpret
--
either
interpretation;
fourth,
the
severity
of
the
additional
sentence;
and
fifth,
the
legislative
history.
today's
opinion
discusses
these
factors
and
we
conclude
as
we
did
in
castillo
that
the
machine
gun
provision
is
an
element
of
an
offense
rather
than
a
sentencing
factor.
little
of
import
has
change
since
castillo.
the
second
through
fifth
factors
continue
to
point
in
the
same
direction
they
did
ten
years
ago
and
given
the
court's
conclusion
in
castillo
that
the
machine
gun
provision
was
an
offense
element;
a
substitutive
change
in
the
statute
should
not
be
inferred
absent
a
clear
indication
from
congress
of
a
change
in
policy.
nothing
in
the
congressional
amendment
to
section
924
suggests
that
change.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
