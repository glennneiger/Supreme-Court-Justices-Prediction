justice
antonin
scalia
well
wait.
there's
--
there's
some
sentencing
stuff
in
--
in
the
first
part
as
well.
there's
sentencing
stuff
in
(a).
you
can't
say
that
(a)
deals
only
with
elements
and
(b)
deals
with
sentencing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
(a)
says,
"shall
be
sentenced
to
5
years.
"
or
to
7
years,
or
to
10
years.
so
there's
sentencing
stuff
in
(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
so
does
--
so
does
the
language
of
(a)(ii)
and
(a)(iii),
which
is
the
same
language:
"if
the
firearm
is
brandished";
"if
the
firearm
is
discharged"
--
they
all
apply
to
a
conviction
for
carrying
the
firearm.
there
has
to
be
a
conviction
before
those
things
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
makes
(a)
the
same
as
(b).
and
--
and
you
don't
claim
that
the
elements
in
(a)
are
just
sentencing
elements,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
still
and
all,
if
--
if
congress
were
being
precise
and
if
the
statute
is
to
be
read
the
way
you
suggest,
the
introduction
to
capital
(b)
should
have
been
"if
the
firearm
possessed
by
a
person
convicted
of
a
violation
of
paragraph
(a)
above.
"
and
then
pick
it
up,
"is",
so
forth.
right?
i
mean,
that
would
--
would
be
more
precise.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
i
agree
with
you
that
if
(b)
is
--
if
(b)
is
an
element,
(c)
would
be
an
element,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
old
one
in
your
brief,
too,
in
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
3a
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
that
with
--
with
(c),
you
--
you
could
say
that
traditionally
recidivism
has
been
a
sentencing
factor,
and
you
cannot
say
with
respect
to
(b)
that
whether
it's
a
short-barreled
rifle
or
a
machinegun
has
traditionally
been
a
sentencing
factor.
to
the
contrary,
it
was
an
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
--
let's
talk
about
the
guidelines.
without
the
application
of
(b),
the
guidelines
would
provide
for
a
much
shorter
sentence,
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
guidelines
--
do
you
think
that
if
under
the
guidelines
the
sentence
was
30
years
because
of
a
machinegun,
do
you
think
that
that
would
be
upheld?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it
would
be
upheld
as
a
reasonable
sentence
under
our
booker/fanfan
theory
of
--
of
how
the
guidelines
are
to
be
applied?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
is
the
life
sentence
maximum,
by
the
way?
i
--
you
say
this
is
a
minimum.
it's
just
a
mandatory
minimum
because
the
maximum
is
specified
to
be
life.
where
is
that
specified?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
do
you
get
the
life
maximum?
i
--
i'm
reading
through,
and
there's
--
it
mentions
nothing
about
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
mentions
nothing
about
life,
then
these
are
not
mandatory
minimums.
to
the
contrary,
they
are
--
they
are
new
maximums.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
find
that
implied
at
all.
i
don't
see
why
it's
implied.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
her
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you
are
exposed
to,
as
i
read
the
statute,
(c)(1)(a)
does
not
impose
a
new
sentence
at
all.
it
just
says
there
will
be
added
to
whatever
the
sentence
is
for
the
crime
of
violence
or
the
drug
trafficking
crime
--
there
will
be
added
to
that
sentence.
then
it
says
you'll
add
7
years;
you'll
add
25
years;
you'll
add
30
years.
those
are
not
mandatory
minimums.
those
are
add-ons
to
the
sentence
provided
by
the
substantive
crime
to
which
(c)(1)(a)
refers.
that
way,
the
whole
thing
makes
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
amend
what
i
said.
it
is
a
mandatory
minimum
if
the
substantive
crime
referred
to
in
(c)(1)(a)
is
above
what
is
specified
in
--
in
this
statute.
but
if
it
--
if
it
is
below
that,
if
the
drug
trafficking
crime
only
provided
for
15
years,
and
you
did
the
crime
with
a
machinegun,
you
get
30
years,
that's
an
add-on.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
also
on
3a
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
(c)(1)(a):
"who,
in
furtherance.
"
"possesses
a
firearm
shall,
in
addition
to
the
punishment
provided
for
by
such
crime
of
violence,
be
sentenced
to.
"
5
years,
7
years,
10
years.
and
then
if
the
firearm,
blah,
blah,
blah,
is
blah,
blah,
blah
--
since
your
--
i
assume
that
that
introductory
language
"in
addition
to
the
punishment
provided
for.
"
is
implicit
in
(b).
it's
expressed
in
(a),
but
i
think
it's
implicit
in
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
addition
to
the
term
that's
--
that
exists
for
the
substantive
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
right
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
tall
lawyers
today.
what
is
this,
tall
lawyer
day?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
guess
i'm
not
following
the
ball
here.
i
thought
the
government
had
conceded
that
sub
(i),
sub
(ii),
sub
(iii)
under
(a)
are
not
sentencing
factors
but
are
elements.
is
that
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
even
worse,
then.
i
agree
with
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
believe
there
is
a
background
of
life
sentence?
you
agree
with
the
government
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
either
is
or
isn't.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
must
be
some
statutory
provision
that
you
--
that
you
--
that
you
rely
upon.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
7
years
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
prior
statute
--
which
was
18
u.s.c.
924(c)(1),
right?
that
did
deal
with
short-barreled
rifle,
short-barreled
shotgun,
machinegun,
and
so
forth,
but
that's
--
that
provision
didn't
say
anything
about
brandishing
or
discharge.
where
--
what
was
--
how
were
they
treated
under
the
prior
law?
