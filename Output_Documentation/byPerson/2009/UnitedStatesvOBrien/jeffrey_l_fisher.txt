mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
set
the
context
for
this
case.
the
government
cannot
point
to
a
single
defendant
under
this
provision
for
the
conduct
at
issue
who
has
ever
received
more
than
10
years
in
prison
absent
the
use
of
a
machinegun.
we
cited
a
long
string
of
cases
in
the
o'brien
brief
and
the
government's
response
in
its
reply
brief
was
silent.
so,
therefore,
the
government
is
here
today
claiming
that
it
is
entitled,
based
on
the
fact
of
a
machinegun,
to
get
20
years
more
than
any
defendant
that
perpetrated
this
conduct
has
ever
gotten,
and
indeed
18
more
years
than
the
government
itself
asked
the
district
judge
in
this
case
for,
once
the
machinegun
provision
was
off
the
table,
under
the
guise
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
sentencing
factor.
we
think
that
this
court's
statutory
interpretation
jurisprudence
as
well,
if
necessary,
this
court's
constitutional
jurisprudence
foreclose
such
a
result.
let
me
start
with
statutory
interpretation.
on
the
government's
theory
in
1998,
congress
stepped
in
and
took
a
statute
that
made
machinegun
use
an
element
and
transformed
it
into
--
into
a
sentencing
factor.
in
other
words,
congress,
without
a
peep,
a
mutter,
or
anything,
and
in
--
in
the
course
of
doing
something
entirely
different,
which
was
reacting
to
this
court's
bailey
decision,
stepped
in
and
took
a
fact
that
formerly
had
to
be
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
trigger
a
30-year
sentence
and
left
that
same
sentence
in
place
but
now
allowed
it
to
be
proved
to
a
judge
by
a
preponderance,
based
on
a
presentence
report,
and,
indeed,
according
to
the
government,
also
stripped
away
the
mens
rea
requirement
that
attached
to
the
statute
when
it
was
an
element.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
we
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
if
this
court
had
to
construe
that
statute
in
a
different
case,
that
provision,
it
would
find
it's
still
an
element.
now,
i
grant
that
it's
a
difference,
a
very
significant
difference
between
10
and
30
years,
but
structurally
it
is
an
element.
and
i
think
an
--
a
good
way
to
go
about
understanding
this
--
i
heard
my
--
my
opponent
today
say
that
this
would
be
indistinguishable
from
harris
or
fly
in
the
face
of
harris.
well,
there's
three
very
important
differences
between
the
machinegun
provision
at
issue
here
and
the
discharge
provision
in
dean
and
the
brandishing
provision
in
harris.
the
first
difference
is
that
this
an
entirely
separate
subparagraph.
now,
if
you
imagine
somebody
amending
the
statute
and
wanting
to
accomplish
what
the
government
says
was
accomplished
here,
why
wouldn't
the
firearm
type
provisions
just
have
been
(iv)
and
(v)
under
capital
letter
(a)?
they're
not.
what
the
draftsperson
did
instead
is
break
them
out
into
an
entirely
separate,
stand-alone
provision.
as
the
ausa
described
it,
when
he
charged
them
in
the
alternative
in
the
district
of
massachusetts,
he
said
i
think
it's
a
greater
and
lesser
offense
situation.
and
that's
what
we
think.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
what
the
government
has
said.
i
believe
the
government's
argument
is
that
the
big
paragraph
with
capital
letter
(a)
sets
forth
the
elements,
and
then
sub
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii)
are
merely
sentencing
factors.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
so
what
sub
(b)
does,
as
i
said,
is
it
creates
a
greater
offense,
and
so,
it's
broken
out
in
a
way
that
incorporates
the
earlier
elements
up
above
in
the
main
paragraph
by
using
the
phrase:
if
a
"firearm
possessed
by
a
person
convicted
of
a
violation
of
this
subsection.
"
that
phrase,
we
believe,
incorporates
the
earlier
elements.
remember
in
harris
this
court
emphasized
that
the
brandishing
provision
just
kept
going
in
the
sentence
and
did
not
incorporate
earlier
elements.
so
when
the
government
stands
here
today
and
says,
well,
when
you
incorporate
the
earlier
elements,
that
shows
it's
a
sentencing
factor,
too,
it
seems
to
me
a
situation
of
heads,
i
win;
tails,
you
lose.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
and
let
me
--
let
me
give
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
if
you
--
if
you
look
again
at
the
appendix
of
the
government's
main
brief,
which
is
1a
and
2a,
the
guts
of
the
statute
is
the
"use
or
carry"
language
or
"possesses
a
firearm"
language
in
the
main
paragraph.
and
then,
the
--
from
the
(iii),
what
you
have
is
the
bailey
fix
right
there.
so,
then
what
happens--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
the
case,
justice
scalia.
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--has
said
a
couple
of
times
that
this
is
a
theoretical
maximum
sentence,
but,
surely,
if
nothing
else,
the
sentencing
reform
act
sets
a
maximum
sentence
here
if
it's
not
just
a
straight
determinant
sentence.
and
we've
argued
at
length
in
the
o'brien
brief
that
the
reasonableness
requirement
under
3553
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
would
have
to
set
a
maximum
sentence.
and
for
the
reason
i
said
at
the
outset,
given
that
no
one
has
ever
received
more
than
10
years
absent
a
machinegun
here,
certainly
that
maximum
sentence
would
be
far
less
than
life
and
far
less
than
30
years.
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--let
me
answer
it--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
i
might
say
one
more--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
i
might
say
one
more
sentence
to
justice
breyer,
and
then
i'll
answer
that.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
breyer,
the
other
thing
i'd
point
out
is
that,
so
therefore,
once
you
make
the
bailey
fix,
you
just
come
--
in
the
old
statute,
then
you
come
to
the
machinegun
provision,
and
you
just
leave
it
where
it
was.
and,
in
fact,
there
are
plenty
of
statutes
that
we've
cited
in
both
briefs
where
there
are
elements
in
the
middle,
sandwiched
between
sentencing
factors.
now,
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
the
general
principle.
the
general
principle
is
this,
at
least
in
terms
of
this
court's
sixth
amendment
law,
is
that:
the
critical
question
to
ask
is
whether
the
defendant
could
receive
the
sentence
the
government
seeks
without
the
fact
at
issue.
seven
years
is
a
sentence
the
defendant
here
could
receive
without
the
machinegun
finding.
thirty
years
is
absolutely
off
bounds.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
there
is
both,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
guidelines
are
not
binding--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
the
guideline
sentences
as
--
as
to
this
statute
are
pegged
exactly
to
the
mandatory
minimums.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
under
the
facts
that
either
we
prove
to
the
jury
or
are
admitted
by
the
defendant.
so
--
so
in
this
case,
the
defendant
could
receive
7
years,
and
we've
conceded
that.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
oh,
certainly,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
seven
years
comes
from
--
comes
from
the
statute,
for
brandishing,
which
is
what
both
defendants
had
admitted
that
they
did.
seven
years--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
they've
admitted
it.
so
they've
waived
any
sixth
amendment
right
as
to
that
sentencing
factor.
we're
willing
to
concede
that.
but
then
you
go
to
the
guidelines,
which
sets
a
7-year
--
a
7-year
recommended
sentence.
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
following
booker,
we
know
that
we
take
that
recommendation
and
we
plug
it
into
section
3553(a),
which,
if
you
want
the
statutory
language,
directs
that
a
sentence
"no
greater
than
necessary
to
serve
the
following
factors.
"
be
introduced
--
i'm
sorry,
be
imposed.
and
when
you
look
at
those
factors,
disparity
is
a
factor
this
court
has
left
in
place
and
emphasized
at
every
term
since
booker,
and
the
guideline
sentence.
and
when
you
put
--
plug
those
things
into
the
facts
here,
we
simply
suggest
there
is
no
way
that
it
would
be
upheld
as
substantively
reasonable
if
the
defendant
got
30
years
absent
the
machinegun
fact
here.
and
we've
also
cited
in
our
brief
several
places
where
the
government
itself
makes
this
--
the
mirror
image
of
the
argument
that
i'm
making
in
the
post-booker,
gall,
rita
world,
when
judges
deviate
downward
from
the
guidelines.
they
emphasize
--
we
quoted
one
eleventh
circuit
case
in
our
brief
where
the
government
got
overturned,
as
substantively
unreasonable,
a
downward
variance
from
a
guideline
recommendation,
because
no
defendant
had
ever
received
such
a
low
sentence.
but
i
don't
have
to,
of
course,
hang
my
hat
on
this
--
on
the
strict
application
of
apprendi
here.
we
think
there's
also
an
even
deeper
problem
that
predates
this
court's
apprendi
jurisprudence,
which
was
flagged
by
this
court
as
early
as
mcmillan,
where
this
court
said
that
if
what
congress
does
is
step
in
and
manipulate
the
elements
of
a
crime
in
order
to
relieve
the
government
of
its
obligation
to
prove
ordinary
and
traditional
elements,
then
we
have
a
pure
due
process
problem,
irrespective
of
any
sixth
amendment
problem.
now,
this
court
has
never
found
such
a
problem,
but
i
would
emphasize
that
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--how
do
we
find
substantively
unreasonable
after
booker?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
if
you're
asking
me
the
question
--
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
and
answer
the
question.
if
you're
asking
me
how
applying
the
principle
this
court
first
articulated
in
mcmillan,
and
you
apply
it
here--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
think
you
have
to
look
any
further
--
well,
there
is
two
places
you
can
look.
you
can
look
both
at
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
effect
of
what
it
did.
the
intent
of
congress,
at
least
as
hypothesized
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
laid
out
at
page
33
of
its
merits
brief,
where
it
says:
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
here
is,
quote,
"simplify
and
streamline
guilt-stage
proceedings"
by
relieving
the
government
of
its
burden
to
prove
this
case
--
this
fact
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
the
judge.
so
that
strikes
one
as,
as
this
court
put
it
in
harris,
an
intent
to
evade
the
ordinary
requirements
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
then,
as
to
effect,
you
can
look
at
what
i've
also
--
what
i've
already
emphasized,
which
is
that
this
sentence
simply
is
not
otherwise
available,
absent
that
fact.
and
that,
on
its
own,
ought
to
tell
this
court
that
it's
dealing
with
an
element.
but
if
it
wants
to
dig
even
deeper,
it
could
--
it
could
describe
it
in
terms
of
a
20-year
increase
over
what
the
defendant
would
otherwise
get
or
what,
indeed,
as
we've
said,
anyone
has
ever
gotten
for
this
act,
absent
a
machinegun.
it
could
do
it
in
terms
of
percentage
and
say
it's
83
percent
higher;
the
court
used
the
phrase
once,
"tail
wagging
the
dog".
i
don't
think
it
matters
exactly
what
exact
avenue
this
court
would
pick.
again,
if
it
were
doing
a
constitutional
analysis
--
i'm
speaking
right
now
constitutionally
instead
of
statutorily
--
it
would
all
end
up
at
the
same
place.
but
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
your
question
also,
with
due
respect
to
you,
justice
ginsburg,
because
what
i
was
talking
about
was
10
years
under
(a)(iii),
of
course,
is
a
sentencing
factor,
as
this
court
held
in
dean,
whereas
under
(b)(i),
the
same
length
of
a
sentence
might
be
an
element.
that
was
a
matter
--
that
was
a
statutory
answer,
and
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
which
is,
of
course,
the
first
thing
you're
going
to
address
in
this
case,
what
we
think
we
can
win
on
without
even
reaching
the
constitutional
questions.
and
the
differences
would
be,
apart
from
the
same
sentence,
you
have
the
structural
difference
that
i've
emphasized.
you
have
the
tradition.
and
let
me
say
a
word
about
tradition,
if
i
might.
the
government
emphasizes
the
guidelines
and
other
kinds
of
statutes.
when
this
court
applies
the
tradition
canon
that
it
established
in
almendarez-torres
and
castillo,
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
look
any
further
than
castillo
itself
to
answer
the
tradition
question.
in
jones,
as
this
court
put
it,
the
reason
we
look
to
tradition
is
because
if
it's
a
close
case,
we're
going
to
not
assume
that
congress
intended
a
radical
departure
from
past
practice.
well,
the
past
practice
here
is
absolutely
unequivocal.
this
court
held
in
castillo,
9-0,
that
congress
intended
this
to
be
an
element.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
contend
that
castillo
absolutely
decides
the
case.
my
contention
that
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
when
this
court
looks
to
tradition
for
purposes
of
construing
the
new
amendments,
that
castillo
gives
the
answer
on
--
at
least
on
tradition,
at
least
as
applying
that
particular
question.
because
congress,
we
know,
intended
it
to
be
an
element
at
least
until
1998.
but
i
think
that
even
--
even
if
you
were
to
step
back
from
the
castillo
analysis
itself
and
the
castillo
factors
themselves,
you
would
also,
i
think,
do
well
to
give
--
again,
not
dispositive,
but
--
but
careful
treatment
to
castillo,
because
congress
steps
in,
of
course,
and
amends
statutes
all
the
time.
they
step
in
and
they
amend
one
portion
of
a
statute,
and
while
they
are
at
it,
we
know
from
the
manuals
that
we've
cited
and
from
the
examples
in
the
back
of
the
o'brien
brief
that
congress
often,
while
they're
amending
one
part,
they
reorganize
or
reword
other
parts
of
the
statute.
and
this
court,
across
its
statutory
interpretation
jurisprudence,
within
criminal
law
and
outside,
has
always
said
that
once
we
say
the
law
means
something,
we're
not
going
to
assume
that
congress
changed
the
law
unless
we
get
some
sort
of
clear
indication
from
congress
that
it
--
that
it
intended
to
change
the
law.
now,
here,
as
i
think
has
been
emphasized,
but
i'll
just
reiterate,
there's
not
a
peep
of
anything
in
the
legislative
history
or
anything
to
suggest
that
congress
was
--
was
intending
to
change
the
law
here.
and,
in
fact,
it's
not
even
a
mere
silence
case.
we
know
quite
clearly
and
affirmatively
that
congress
was
intending
to
do
something
entirely
different,
which
was
respond
to
this
court's
bailey
decision.
but
even
in
the
language
--
and
the
only
thing
i
think
the
solicitor
general
even
has
for
it
in
this
case
is
the
language
and
structure,
which
are
some
different
words
and
different
placement
that
it
can
at
least
build
an
argument
off
of,
because
the
other
four
of
the
five
castillo
factors
are
entirely
unchanged.
but
even
the
language,
we
submit,
is
a
far
cry
from
the
kind
of
change
this
court
ought
to
require
before
it
does
a
180-degree
switch
as
to
what
it
had
said
the
prior
law
meant.
just
for
purposes
of
stability
in
the
law,
if
nothing
else,
i
think
this
--
it
behooves
this
court
to
take
its
prior
decisions
seriously
and
to
--
and
to
engage
in
a
dialogue
with
congress
that
encourages
congress
to
be
clear
when
it
wants
to
change
what
the
prior
law
is.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
they
--
as
you
say,
they
were
not
in
the
statute
itself.
my
understanding
is
that
judges
as
--
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
would
have
treated
those
as
sentencing
factors.
and
what
congress
did
--
when
it
came
in
to
respond
to
this
court's
bailey
decision,
i
think
it
codified
all
of
the
different
manners
of
using
the
gun
in
the
context
of
one
of
these
crimes.
so
it
not
just
dealt
with,
yes,
possessing
ought
to
be
covered,
but
it
talked
about
other
manners,
brandishing
and
discharging.
in
castillo,
this
court
emphasized
again
the
big
difference
between
manner
of
using
a
gun
and
the
type
of
firearm
which
lies
at
the
core
of
this
offense.
if
i
would
turn
--
if
i
would
leave
the
court
with
nothing
else,
let
me
emphasize
again
to
the
court
the
difference
between
this
statute,
which
i
think
the
government
wants
you
to
think
is
no
different
in
intent,
effect,
or
operation
than
the
two
that
this
court
prior
--
dealt
with
in
harris,
as
a
matter
of
both
statutory
construction
and
constitutional
law,
and
in
mcmillan,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
what
this
court
emphasized
in
both
of
those
cases
was
that
there
was
a
preexisting
law
on
the
books
that
criminalized
certain
activity.
and
then
a
legislature
later
stepped
in
and
set
a
mandatory
minimum
for
a
particular
fact
that
could
accompany
the
crime
at
issue.
and
it
did
so
in
a
very
minor
way.
for
example,
in
pennsylvania,
the
various
crimes
covered
by
the
firearm
mandatory
minimum
in
that
case
gave
10-,
20-year
sentences
routinely,
and
all
the
pennsylvania
legislature
did
was
step
in
and
say:
if
he
uses
a
gun,
we
want
at
least
5
years.
and
in
harris,
as
i've
just
emphasized,
i
think,
in
discussing
with
justice
scalia,
the
court
dealt
with
a
bump
of
just
2
years.
again,
what
judges
were
already
customarily
doing,
i
think,
under
the
statute.
here,
this
is
entirely
and
dramatically
different.
here,
the
fact
allows
a
sentence
--
indeed,
requires
a
sentence
--
that
is
20
years
longer
than
anyone
has
ever
gotten
for
this
conduct
at
issue.
that
is
a
difference
not
just
--
it's
not
a
minor
difference.
it
is
a
categorically
different
difference
that
we
think
is
enough,
combined
with
other
principles
of
statutory
and
constitutional
interpretation,
to
--
i'm
sorry,
statutory
interpretation
to
resolve
this
case
on
the
statute
alone.
but
if
you
need
to
look
to
the
constitution,
we
think
that
the
sixth
amendment,
either
as
the
bright-line
rule
articulated
in
apprendi
dictates
that
any
fact
that
allows
a
greater
sentence
than
the
defendant
could
otherwise
receive
is
subject
to
the
sixth
amendment,
or
sort
of
plain,
pure
due
process,
tail-that-wags-the-dog
analysis,
that
this
court
emphasized
in
mcmillan
--
either
of
those
would
be
enough,
and
indeed
require,
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
here
and
a
finding
this
court
can
avoid.
and
if
nothing
else,
justice
breyer,
i
would
say
that
we
think
that
this
case
can
be
resolved
on
statutory
grounds.
we
think
there
are
narrower
constitutional
arguments
that
would
either
require
reading
it
narrowly
or
striking
it
down
if
you
had
to,
on
even
narrower
grounds.
but
if
nothing
else,
then
we
would
ask
this
court
to
revisit
harris,
if
necessary.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
resolve
the
case
for
us
here,
but
we
think
that
would
be
appropriate
if
it
--
if
it
needed
to
get
there.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
assume
so,
but
i
don't
know
the
specific
answer
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
what
there
is
a
dispute
about,
of
course,
is
whether
the
--
if
it
were
a
sentencing
factor,
whether
the
government
has
to
prove
knowledge.
and
we
do
emphasize
that
that
would
be
an
alternative
basis
for
this
court
to
decide
this
case,
by
saying
you
at
least
have
to
prove
knowledge
even
if
it's
a
sentencing
factor.
and
let
me
just
leave
you
with
this,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions:
the
government
makes
a
couple
points
in
its
reply
brief
suggesting
that
certain
arguments
were
not
preserved
or
made
properly
in
this
case.
the
knowledge
argument
that
i
just
referred
to
is
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition
for
mr.
o'brien
at
pages
23
to
25.
so
under
rule
15
of
this
court,
that
argument
was
properly
presented
at
the
cert
stage.
you
will
also
find
that
argument
at
pages
34
to
37
of
the
joint
appendix.
also
with
respect
to
the
sixth
amendment
substantive
reasonableness
as-applied
argument,
the
government
suggests
that
for
some
reason,
that
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
reach
or
rely
on.
again,
we
disagree.
first
of
all,
we
can't
understand
why
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
reach
or
rely
on
that
constitutional
argument,
whereas
it
is
apparently
appropriate
for
this
court
to
address
the
mcmillan
argument
or
the
"overrule
harris"
argument.
they're
all
three
constitutional
arguments
that
are
present
in
this
case.
and,
again,
if
there
were
any
doubt
they
were
raised
below,
pages
38
and
39
of
mr.
burgess's
first
circuit
brief,
pages
32
to
35
of
mr.
o'brien's
first
circuit
brief,
and
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
which
the
government,
in
its
reply
brief
at
the
cert
stage,
responded
to
without
claiming
any
error
or
any
waiver
problems.
so
we
think
absolutely
all
the
arguments
that
are
made
in
the
blue
--
in
the
red
briefs
are
clearly
before
you.
if
the
court
has
any
additional
questions,
i
would
be
happy
to
entertain
them.
otherwise,
i
am
prepared
to
submit
the
case.
