justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
--
what
power
conferred
upon
the
federal
government
by
the
constitution
permits
the
federal
government
to
assure
that
sexual
predators
are
not
at
large?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
said
no.
i
mean,
there
is
no
constitutional
power
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
to
protect
society
from
sexual
predators.
and,
you
know,
once
the
federal
custody
is
at
an
end,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
only
power
you
could
be
relying
upon.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
fully
reestablished
once
he
walks
out
of
federal
prison,
at
least
if
he
walks
out
of
federal
prison
into
a
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
don't
fall
through
the
cracks
if
the
federal
government
notifies
the
state
into
which
this
prisoner
is
to
be
released:
we
are
going
to
release
a
prisoner;
we
think
he's
sexually
dangerous;
you
should
take
some
action
to
be
sure
that
he
doesn't
harm
society.
because
that's
a
state
police
function,
it's
none
of
our
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
kagan,
you
are
relying
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
right?
you
say:
but
"necessary
and
proper"
doesn't
mean
it's
necessary
and
proper
for
the
good
of
society.
it
means
it's
necessary
and
proper
for
the
execution
of
another
power
that
the
federal
government
is
given
by
the
constitution.
now,
why
is
this
necessary
for
the
execution
of
any
federal
power?
the
federal
criminal
proceeding
has
terminated.
the
individual
is
released.
you
could
say
it's
necessary
for
the
good
of
society,
but
that's
not
what
the
federal
government
is
charged
with.
why
is
it
necessary
to
any
function
that
the
federal
government
is
performing?
it
has
completed
its
performance
of
the
function
of
incarcerating
this
individual
until
he
has
served
his
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
kagan,
i
--
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
if
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
wrote
the
governor
of
the
state
into
which
this
person
is
to
be
released,
and
they
try
to
release
him
in
the
state
where
he
--
he
will
in
the
future
reside,
and
said,
we
are
about
to
release
this
person
in
60
days
or
whatever,
in
our
view
there
are
serious
mental
problems,
and
we
think
the
state
ought
to
consider
commitment
proceedings,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
an
elected
governor
or
an
elected
attorney
general
would
ignore
that
letter.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
governor
is
going
to
say
that
at
the
next
election:
it
would
have
cost
too
much
to
put
this
guy
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
it
costs
$65,000.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
i'm
--
i'm
not
terribly
impressed
with
--
with
the
argument--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
states
won't
do
it.
[laughter]
i
mean,
this
--
this
is
a
recipe
for
the
federal
government
taking
over
everything.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
states
won't
do
it;
therefore,
we
have
to
do
it.
it
has
to
be
done,
and
therefore
the
federal
government
steps
in
and
does
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
release
from
the
army?
would
that
--
would
that
also
--
if
i
want
to
turn
this
--
this
person
after
discharge
at
--
you
know,
loose
upon
the
society,
could
the
federal
government
commit
that
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i'm
sure
you
didn't.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
--
we
have
a
federal
agency
that's
--
that
deals
with
communicable
diseases.
it's
part
of
the
national
institute
of
health,
i
believe.
is
that
agency
ultra
vires?
i
mean,
aren't
communicable
--
i
mean,
if
anything
relates
to
interstate
commerce,
it's
communicable
diseases,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
try
the
tenth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
[laughter]
the
government
can
spend
money
on
whatever
it
wants.
that's
the
spending
power.
they
can
set
up
hospitals.
the
issue
is
whether
they
can
force
somebody
into
a
hospital,
not
whether
they
can
set
up
hospitals.
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
tell
us
why
the
sky
will
not
fall
if
we
--
if
we
go
the
way
you
would
like
us
to.
i
assume
that
if
the
problem
is
that
the
states
are
unwilling
to
incur
the
expenses
for
these
people,
that
congress
could
pass
a
statute
saying
the
federal
government
will
pay
the
expenses
of
any
prisoners
released
from
federal
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
to
me
that
statute,
combined
with
a
letter
to
the
elected
governor,
who
probably
wants
to
be
re-elected,
or
the
elected
attorney
general,
will
make
it
pretty
certain
that
the
state
will
take
over
the
responsibility
for
the
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
--
don't
states
have
involuntary
commitment
procedures?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
couldn't
the
federal
government
fund
a
federal
--
would
you
find
a
constitutional
problem
in
the
federal
government
funding
an
office
which
brings
involuntary
commitment
proceedings
in
a
state
where
a
prisoner
is
released
when
the
federal
government
believes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
prisoner
is
unsafe?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
presume
the
state
couldn't
--
if
the
--
if
the
court
says
commitment
is
proper,
the
state
would
have
to
accept
the
commitment,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
they
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
most
of
the
argument
for
why
this
is
constitutional
is
simply
it's
necessary,
and
therefore
it's
constitutional.
but
i'm
not
even
sure
it's
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
they
send
them?
the
last
residence
where--
