mr.
g.
alan
dubois
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
really
think
the
government
gives
the
game
away
a
bit
in
its
opening
statement
when
it
characterized
this
law
as
a
law
that
was
necessary
to
prevent
the
problem
of
releasing
sexually
dangerous
individuals.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
is
designed
to
do.
the
power
to
enforce
the
law
which
brought
the
defendants
into
federal
custody
in
the
first
place
has
been
exhausted.
the
defendant
has
been
tried
and
convicted,
and
he's
sentenced
and
he's
served
his
sentence.
that
law
has
been
fully
vindicated.
at
that
point,
any
further
detention
must
stand
on
an
independent
constitutional
footing.
it
cannot--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
is
a
--
is
a
different
case
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
off,
the
commitment
that
flows
from
a
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
verdict
is
directly
linked
to
the
federal
law
which
brought
you
into
custody
in
the
first
place.
the
person
is
found
to
be
--
to
have
been
committed
the
crime,
but
he
is
only
--
he
is
only
excused
from
punishment
for
that
crime
by
basis
of
his
mental
illness.
so
there's
a
direct
link
between
the
--
the
crime
which
brought
you
into
federal
custody
and
your
subsequent
commitment.
the
other
distinction,
of
course,
is
that
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
must
be
pled
by
the
defendant,
and
in
some
sense
the
commitment
is
in
lieu
of
punishment;
it's
not
an
additional
punishment
tacked
on
at
the
end
of
the
sentence.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
infirmities
of
4248
are
at
play
at
all
in--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--they
are
vindicating
their
interest
in
the
specific
criminal
law
which
brought
the
individual
into
custody,
which
presumably
in
most
cases
--
in
all
cases,
i
guess
--
is
supported
by
an
enumerated
power.
it
is
--
as
i
say,
the
commitment
is
--
is
a
substitute
for
punishment,
it's
in
lieu
of
punishment,
but
it's
directly
linked
to
the
crime
which
brought
the
individual
into
federal
custody.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
your
honor,
i
think
a
single
individual
with
a
single
communicable
disease,
a
defendant
with
tuberculosis--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--or
something
of
that
nature,
i
don't
think
would
--
would
call
for
that
type
of
--
of
federal
government--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--i
would
say--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that,
in
the
same
way
that
mental
health
is
a
uniquely
state
function,
so
too
is
public
health.
and
we
would
say
that,
no,
the
federal
government
cannot
detain
that
person
past
the
end
of
his
sentence,
and
that--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--i
was
about
to
say,
your
honor,
you
know,
that's
the
--
that's
the
other
i
think
significant
difference
that
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
that
there
is
a
clear
hook
to
interstate
commerce
when
we
are
talking
about
communicable
diseases,
and
that
hook
is
simply
not
present.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
no,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
the
federal
government
has
that
power.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
it
doesn't
have
the
power
to
detain
individuals
as
a
result
of
their
mental
illness
based
on
the
fear
that
they
are
going
to
go
out
and
commit
a
crime.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
would
not
be
a
very
large
extension,
if
it's
an
extension
at
all,
of
the
holding
in
morrison,
that
the
federal
government
could
not
do
that.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
or
the
tenth
amendment,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--that
would
certainly
not
be
the
case
here,
your
honor.
all
of
these
individuals
--
there
is
no
claim
that
these
individuals
became
mentally
ill
while
in
the
custody
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
these
are
all,
as
far
as
i
understand,
illnesses
which
predate
their
entry
into
the
federal
prison--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
have
a
power,
but
it's
not
an
unlimited
power.
that
power
is
addressed
by
statute--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--they
have
a
power,
but
it's
not
an
unlimited
power.
there
is
a
statute,
4245,
which
allows
the
government
to
transfer
an
individual
who
becomes
ill
while
in
the
custody
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
to
a
psychiatric
facility
for
care
and
treatment.
now,
by
the
terms
of
that
statute,
however,
that
commitment
must
end
at
the
end
of
their
sentence,
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
extent
of
the
government's
power.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
because
at
that
point,
the
government
has
no
live
federal
interest.
they
are
--
they
have
effectuated
the
power
which
brought
the
person
into
custody.
they
have
fully
vindicated
the-the
criminal
law
that
brought
them
into
--
into
the
prisons.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
and
i'm
sure
stuff
like
that
does
happen,
justice
kennedy,
and,
again,
the
government
does,
while
the
person
is
in
the
custody
of
bureau
of
prisons,
is
entitled
to--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--because
he
has
--
he
has
caught
some
disease--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--while
in
the
system?
again,
i
think
--
first,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
any
prisoner
would
take
that
deal.
they
would
rather
be
treated
in
the
community.
so
it
becomes
a
question
of
whether
the
person
can
be
held
for
the
safety
of
others,
and
again,
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
your
honor,
i
think
the
federal
government
would
have
no
power
to
do
that.
the
--
while
the
individual
is
in
the
custody
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
the
federal
government
does
have
a
limited
parens
patriae
power
to
see
to
their
care
and
treatment.
now,
i
think
we
are
getting
a
little
bit
far
afield
from
the,
you
know,
indefinite,
potential
lifetime
detention
at
issue
here
and
whether,
under
doctor's
orders,
the
--
tells
the
person,
well,
you
ought
to
stay
in
the
hospital
for
an
extra
week
so
this
leg
sets
properly
--
you
know,
something
of
that
limited
duration,
perhaps,
might
be
a
good--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--that
the
federal
government
cannot
set
up
a
system
of--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
again,
that
would
have
to--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
i
think
it
would
have
to
relate
to
an
enumerated
power,
and
it
would
have
to
be--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--in
furtherance
of
an
enumerated
power.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
--
and
that
option,
which
we
--
we
definitely
believe
is
the
best
option--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
make
that
assumption,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
--
the
fear
is
that
the
state
will
decline
responsibility,
i
do
not
think
that
federal
power
can
expand
or
contract
based
on
a
state's
willingness
or
unwillingness
to
accept
a
responsibility--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
your
honor
--
your
honor,
i
think
that
may
be
right,
but
there
--
but
there
are
--
the
question
is:
what's
a
constitutional
response
to
that
problem?
we
can
imagine
plenty
of
unconstitutional
responses.
for
instance,
a
person--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
i
think
the
different
constitutional
question
is
--
again,
i
do
not
believe
the
federal
government
has
a
general
quarantine
power
that
doesn't
--
that
would
allow
it
to
hold
prisoners
past
their
release
date.
i
think
that
is
a
public
health
problem,
except
for
--
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
a
closer
nexus
to
a
forward-looking
commerce
clause
hook
that
doesn't
exist
in
this
case.
the
government's
argument
is
purely
backwards
looking.
they
--
they
locate
the
power
to
commit--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government's
argument
essentially
collapses
into
the
notion,
well,
if
it's
a
good
idea,
it
must
be
necessary
and
proper
to
do
it.
i
think
that's
just
simply
not
correct.
it's
very
--
we're
going--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
there--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--absolutely,
the
government
--
the
government
has
a
responsibility,
but
they
have
certain
constitutional
limits
that
also
must
be
respected.
so
the
statute--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--right.
and
--
and
--
well,
i
think
there's
--
there's
a
number
of
weapons
in
the
federal
government's
arsenal.
first
of
all,
there's
the
federal
spending
power.
second
of
all,
there
is
already,
in
the
statute
of
4042,
a
specific
duty
to
warn,
just
as
justice
scalia
was
positing.
it
already
exists.
any
time
the
federal
government
is
going
to
release
a
person
they
believe
to
be
violent
or
dangerous,
they
are
required
to
warn
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
within
a
certain
period
of
time
before
their
release.
at
that
point,
i
do
believe
it
becomes
a
problem
of
the
state
polity.
if
the
state
governor
is
going
to
be
cavalier
about
that
type
of
release,
then
i
think
the
answer
for
that
lies
in
the
voters
of
that
state,
to
say,
no,
we
want
you
to
take
this
problem
seriously
and--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--and
he's
going
to--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--exactly.
the
federal
government
has
to,
and
at
that
point,
the
state
must
make
that
hard
political
decision.
do
we
want
to
take
this
person
on,
spend
the
money
necessary
to--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--and
so,
in
that
sense,
it's
no
decision
at
all
because
the
constitution
requires
that
they
be
released.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
i--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
we'll
just
start
--
i
think,
a
couple
of
responses.
first
off,
this
is-that
is
no
part
of
the
government's
argument
in
this
case.
their
--
their
argument
is
a
backward-looking
argument
that
locates
its
power
in
the
fact
that
they
have
had
these
people
in
their
custody,
and
they
can't
responsibly
let
them
go.
what
you
are
positing
is
more
of
a
forwardlooking
argument
that
would
essentially
create
a
federal
parens
patriae
power,
that
the
federal
government
has--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
it
--
it
is
complex,
justice
breyer,
and
it's
also,
i
think,
historically-the
federal
government
has
not
historically
thought
to
have
been
able
to
have
the
sort
of
general
parens
patriae
power
that
--
that
the
states
do
enjoy
to
take
care
of
the
health
and
well-being
of
its
citizens.
i
think
it
would
be
quite
a
step
for
the
federal
government
to
embark
on
an
enterprise
of
that
nature.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
every
state
does,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
there
would
have--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--there
would
be
absolutely
no
problem
with
that,
your
honor.
the
congress,
with
spending
power,
would
have
clear
ability
to
fund
that
type
of
program
run
--
run
and
administered
by
the
states.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
they
should
do
that.
i
mean,
what
they
are
doing
here
is
what
they
can't
do.
just--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--and,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
to
answer
your
question,
justice
stevens,
you
are
absolutely
right.
and
i
think
there
--
there
are
many
tools
that
congress
has
at
its
disposal
to
address
this
problem.
the
spending
power
is
one.
every
one
of
these
individuals
would
be
on
federal
supervised
release.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
the
first
thing
they
can
do
is
act
as
a
liaison
between
the
individual
and
the
state.
every
one
of
these
individuals
will
have
a
federal
probation
officer
who
will
be
responsible
for
their
supervision
during
the
period
of
supervised
release.
they
also
have
the
ability
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
conviction
and
seek
modifications
of
the
terms
of
supervised
release,
that
they
have
certain
concerns--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--those
modifications
could
include
things
like
mandating
mental
health
treatment
during
the
term
of
supervised
release,
certain
limitations
on
travel,
certain
limitations
on
activities
with
computers.
a
fairly
large
range
of--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
concern,
the
--
the
fact
that
we
want
to
do
something
before
the
release
is
addressed
by
4042,
which
is
the
duty
to
warn
statute.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
that
would
not
be
constitutional,
justice
sotomayor,
because
of
the
indefinite
nature
of
the
commitment.
you
can
envision
a
system
--
and
we
had
that
type
of
system
in
the
'50s,
'60s,
and
'70s
--
of
indeterminate
sentencing,
where--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--so
if
we
have
an
indeterminatetype
sentence
where
you
--
you
get
a
sentence
of
10
years
and
you
are
periodically
reviewed
to
see
if
you
are
safe
to
be
released,
of
course
that's
constitutional.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
it's
a
part
of
the
sentence.
it's
part
of
the
punishment
for
the
crime
which
brought
you
into
custody.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
sure.
a
judge
--
whether
you
are
being
sentenced
for
bank
robbery
or
--
or
some
sort
of
sexual
offense,
the
judge
can
take
into
account
the
whole
of
your
criminal
history
in
determining
what
you
are
being
sentenced
for,
but
you
are
still
only
being
sentenced
for
the
crime
for
which
you
are
convicted.
and
that
would
be
cabined
by
the
varying
statutory
maxes
for
each
specific
offense.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
that's
why
in
this
case
it's--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
that
point
the
enumerated
power
which
supported
the
crime
has
been
fully
effectuated.
it
has
been
exhausted.
there
is
no
further
backward-looking
federal
power
to
be
vindicated
under
article
i.
now,
there
may
be
a
forward-looking
power.
if
there
is
one,
the
government
hasn't
identified
it.
but
that's
where
the
constitutional
justification
would
have
to
be
found
in
this
case.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
and
--
and
that
really
is,
i
think,
historically,
sort
of
an
anomalous
argument
in
the
sense
that
civil
commitment
has
never
been
thought
to
be
part
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
they
are
two
separate
spheres
of
government
control
and
government
authority.
and
while
they
may
intersect
at
the
state
level,
a
state
doesn't
civilly
commit
its
citizens
based
on
the
fact
that
it's
running
a
prison
system
or
the
fact
that
it
has
them
in
custody.
it
commits
these
people
based
on
their
parens
patriae
and
general
police
powers.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
think
under
greenwood
that
type
of
commitment
is
appropriate.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
constitutionally
significant,
because
--
well,
there's
a
couple
of
reasons.
but
the
first
reason
is,
again,
you
have
a
direct
link
to
the
unexhausted
power.
the
power
to
prosecute
still
exists,
and
the
government's
interest
only
isn't
the
interest
in
punishment;
the
government
does
have
an
interest
in
obtaining
a
conviction,
which
is
still
alive.
and
if
the
person
does
restore
--
regain
competency
to
the
extent
that
he
can
be
tried,
he
can
be
convicted.
even
if
he
cannot
be
--
he
cannot
be
punished
any
further,
he
still
can
be
tried
and
convicted,
and
the
government's
interests
can
be
vindicated.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
and
i
think
that
was
the
--
the
logic
or
the
trade-off
in
greenwood,
which
was
that
we
were
not
going
to
require
courts
to
make
finely
grained
determinations
about
whether
or
not
this
person
or
that
person
might
regain
competency,
and
just
decide
to
have
a
simpler
test
that
commitment
is
appropriate
as
long
as
the
federal
government's
interest
has
not
been
exhausted
or
vindicated.
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
well,
i
think
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
at
the
time
of
conviction
and
sentence,
the
interest
in
--
the
official
regulation
of
interstate
commerce,
say,
has
been
vindicated
by
this
person's
conviction
for
doing
an
activity
which
congress
has
judged
to
be
interfering
with
interstate
commerce.
and
that--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
congress
does
have
almost
unlimited
authority
to
set
statutory
maximums
for
different
crimes
based
on
their
estimation
of
the
severity
of
the
crime.
i
--
i
don't
see
that
that
causes
a
problem.
the
problem
here
is
that
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
the
--
say,
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
desire
to
prevent
primarily
local
sex
offences.
it's
very
difficult
to
say
how
preventing
general,
statetype
violent
crimes
has
anything
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce.
and
that's
what
this--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--well,
i
really
think
that
that
argument
the
government
raises
is
a
bit
of
a
red
herring.
i
have
been
practicing
as
a
federal
defender
for
a
very
long
time.
i
have
never
yet
had
a
defendant
where
the
bureau
of
prisons
didn't
know
where
to
send
them.
and
there
has
never
been
a
case
where
a
defendant
did
not
have
a
state
to
go
to,
and--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--the
--
the
default
is
--
as
the
government
indicated,
is
the
court
of
conviction,
the
place
of
conviction,
which
is
probably
about
90
percent
of
the
time
their
home
state,
anyway.
but
if
--
if
they
are
from
a
different
home
state,
generally
the
bureau
of
prisons
tries
to
come
up
with
a
release
plan
to
release
them
to
their
state
of
domicile.
and--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--and
every
--
and
then,
following
that
examination,
they
could
be
then
detained
indefinitely?
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
constitutional,
your
honor,
because
it
still
would
have
to
be
part
of
the
punishment
for
the
crime.
civil
commitment
is
a
civil--
mr.
g.
alan
dubois
--we
do
not
know
that
this
statute
cannot
be
written
constitutionally.
all
we
know
is
this
statute
is
not
written
constitutionally,
because
it
is
effectively
unlimited.
it
effectively
does
require
no
connection
between
the
underlying
criminal
charge
and
the
subsequent
commitment.
you
can
be
in
custody
for
any
crime
whatsoever.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
sex-related.
you
can
never
have
been
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
whatsoever.
so
it
really
is
--
there's
almost
a
complete
de-linking
of
the
crime
which
brought
you
into
federal
custody
and
your
subsequent
commitment.
can
we
imagine
hypotheticals
that
--
that
create
a
link,
that
rolls
it
into
the
punishment?
perhaps,
but
that's
not
this
statute,
and
this
statute
must
fail
for
that
reason.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
thank
you.
