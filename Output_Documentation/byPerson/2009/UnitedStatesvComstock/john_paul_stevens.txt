justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
this
statute
applies
even
if
a
person
has
not
been
a
sexual
offender
in
the
past?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
argument
doesn't
take
care
of
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
my
point
is
the
law
applies
to
a
person
who
is
convicted
of
armed
robbery
or
bank
robbery,
and
just
before
the
end
of
his
term
in
prison
the
authorities
decide
he
is
in
fact
a
potential
sexual
offender.
they
can
detain
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
--
that's
not
a
necessary
element
of
the
--
of
the
statute
--
under
the
statute,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dubois,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
hypothetical
that
general
kagan
posited?
supposing
after
a
man
has
been
sentenced,
say,
to
30
days
for
gun
possession,
20
--
10
days
before
he
is
to
be
released,
it's
determined
he
has
a
communicable
disease
--
he
would
spread
a
disease
if
he
gets
out.
could
the
--
could
the
federal
government
have
the
power
to
detain
him
at
the
end
of
the
30
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
not
call
for
it.
my
question
is
would
it
have
the
power--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
to
release
him,
because
there
--
there's
strong
evidence
that,
as
soon
as
he
gets
into
the
society,
the
disease
will
--
will
pass
to
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
that
goes
to
--
that
goes
to
the
question
of
the
wisdom
of
the
statute.
i
think,
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
we
have
to
assume
that
there
are
cases
out
there
in
which
there
will
be
no
solution
such
as
the
one
justice
scalia
proposes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
why
congress
acted,
because
they
think
there
are
such
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
are
asked
to
decide
a
question
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
states
and
there
are
governors
who
will
not
react
to
the
problem
of
particular
prisoners
who
are
released
in
arizona
or
some
place
when
they
originally
came
from
michigan
or
whatever
it
is.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
statute
would
--
would
play
a
role.
justice
john
paul
stevens
absolutely,
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
that
the
constitutional
answer
is
the
same
in
this
statute
as
in
the
case
of
somebody
who
incurs
a
very
communicable
disease
and
the
government
wants
to
prevent
him
from
infecting
the
community.
why
is
it
a
different
constitutional
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
it's
purely
backwards
looking,
and
it
takes
care
of
the
case
that
--
the
premise
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
the
release
itself
is
a
federal
act
that
has
to
be
done
responsibly,
and
the
very
release,
if
it
causes
harm
to
the
community,
can
be
prevented.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
we
can
all
think
of
a
lot
of
different
statutes
congress
might
have
enacted.
we
have
to
decide
whether
this
one
is
constitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
follow
up
on
justice
alito's
question.
supposing
congress
passed
a
statute
that
said
at
the
expiration
of
every
sentence,
the
prisoner
shall
examined
for
certain
reasons,
and
if
he
fails
certain
tests,
he
shall
not
be
released
for
another
30
days.
say
he
should
be
examined
to
determine
whether
he
is
a
sexual
predator.
and
that's
in
every
--
every
sentence
at
the
time
of
the
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and
it
says
so
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
elements
of
the
punishment
is
that
you
are
subjected
to
this
examination
that
otherwise
you
wouldn't
have
to
take.
it
seems
to
me
maybe
your
case
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
--
that
congress
hasn't
written
the
right
statute.
