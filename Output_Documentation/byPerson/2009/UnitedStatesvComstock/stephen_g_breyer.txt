justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
--
why
not?
i
mean,
is
there
anything
to
prevent
the
united
states
government
to
say:
mental
illness
is
a
serious
problem
in
the
united
states,
and
we
feel
the
states
sometimes
do
a
good
job,
sometimes
they
don't,
but
we
want
to
set
up
a
group
of
federal
mental
hospitals
and
treatment
centers
of
the
most
modern
kind,
and
in
these
circumstances,
there
will
be
a
handful
of
people
who
pose
a
threat
to
themselves
or
others,
in
which
case
they
must
be
restrained.
there
might
be
due
process
problems,
whether
you
have
the
right
person,
whether
they
should
be
restrained,
et
cetera.
but
doesn't
the
constitution
give
authority
to
the
federal
government
to
set
up
a
system
of
mental
illness
prevention
and
cure,
if
in
fact
they
determine
that
that's
a
desirable
use
of
federal
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
have
the
power
to
set
up
hospitals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
if
the
doctors
were
to
say,
there
are
a
thousand
people
here
suffering
from
mental
illness,
your
own
daughter
or
mine
or
someone
has
a
--
is
threatening
suicide
or
threatening
murder?
there
are
lots
of
real
cases
like
that,
where
people
have
terrible
times,
and
there
are
not
adequate
state
facilities.
and
were
the
federal
government
to
say,
this
is
a
problem
that
we
wish
to
go
into
and
help
with,
you
are
saying
the
constitution
prohibits
that?
where
does
it
prohibit
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
once
you're
down
that
road
--
i
was
rather
surprised,
but
not
too
surprised,
that,
i
think
perhaps
with
prompting,
i
heard
you
say,
i
think,
that
the
tenth
amendment
would
prohibit
the
federal
government
from
setting
up
a
system
of
mental
care,
which
you'd
better
tell
the
people
across
the
street,
if
that's
your
view.
the
--
the
--
is
that
what
you
are
actually
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
national
mental
care
for
mentally
ill
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you
either
think
that
the
constitution
prohibits
that
or
you
think
it
permits
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
probably
the
commerce
clause
power.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
fine--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
--
go
back
once
more
because
i
am
obviously
getting
nowhere
with
this,
but
i
thought
that,
if
you
set
up
a
set
of
hospitals,
as
i
think
the
government
could
do,
there
will
be
a
few
people,
sometimes,
who
have
to
be
restrained
in
those
hospitals
for
themselves
or
others'
benefit.
if
you
set
up
a
system
of
mental
hospitals,
that's
even
more
true.
if
you
set
up
a
university,
some
people
will
be
sick,
and
they
will
be
in
the
infirmary,
and
occasionally,
you
will
come
across
a
person
who
has
to
be
restrained,
et
cetera.
now,
once
you
are
down
the
road
where
you
admit
the
government
can
do
that,
how
is
a
prison
any
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
set
up
a
prison
where,
in
fact,
occasionally,
people
have
to
be
restrained
for
health
reasons,
et
cetera,
and
just
as
in
the
other
cases,
sometimes
that
can
last
past
the
normal
release
date,
so
can
it
in
prison.
maybe
there's
a
better
way,
but
why
isn't
this
just
a
normal
part
of
running
this
institution,
just
as
it
is
in
the
other
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not,
actually.
i'm
just
showing
you
the
connection
between
running
an
institution,
which,
for
whatever
set
of
reasons
in
the
constitution,
you
have
the
authority
to
do,
and
then
it
becomes,
as
part
of
that
institution,
part
of
the
job
to
take
care
of
people
in
a
certain
way.
sometimes
that
requires
a
restraint,
and
sometimes
that
restraint
could
last
beyond
the
period
where
in
the
absence
of
that
need
the
person
would
no
longer
be
part
of
the
institution.
that's
true
of
a
hospital,
of
a
mental
hospital,
and
of
a
prison.
whether
they
rest
on
the
same
power
or
a
different
power,
the
government
has
the
power,
federal,
to
establish
all
of
those
institutions.
i'm
just
drawing
institutional
connections.
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
saying.
maybe
that's
an
unnecessarily
complex
argument,
but
i
was
just
seeing
it
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
federal
statute
authorizes
federal
authorities
to
confine
a
federal
prisoner,
who
is
mentally
ill
and
sexually
dangerous;
dangerous
to
others.
beyond
the
time,
his
prison
term
expires.
the
respondents
here
challenged
the
statute
on
several
different
constitutional
grounds
only
one
of
which
is
before
us.
does
article’s
necessary
and
proper
clause,
grant
congress
the
power,
the
authority
to
enact
the
statute,
we
conclude
that
it
does.
article
1
sets
forth
a
list
of
specifically
enumerated
legislative
powers
that
the
constitution
grants
to
congress.
it
says
for
example,
that
congress
can
regulate
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
it
can
establish
post
offices
and
so
forth.
article
1
also
contains
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
which
grants
congress
the
authority,
“to
make
all
laws
which
shall
be
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
execution
the
foregoing
powers.”
this
court
is
pointed
out
that
every
law
enacted
by
congress
must
be
based
on
one
or
more
enumerated
powers.
but
as
the
court
earlier
pointed
out
in
the
famous
case
mcculloch
v.
maryland,
a
government
entrusted
with
such
powers
must
also
be
entrusted
with
ample
means
for
their
execution.
in
language
that
is
come
to
define
the
clause,
chief
justice
marshall
wrote
that
the
end
be
legitimate,
that
it
be
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution
and
all
means
which
are
appropriate,
which
are
plainly
adapted
to
that
end,
which
are
not
prohibited
but
consistent
with
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution
are
constitutional.
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
thus
supplements
the
authority
granted
in
the
specifically
enumerated
clauses
with
broad
powers
to
enact
laws
that
are
convenient
or
useful,
or
conducive
to
the
more
specific
authorities,
beneficial
exercise,
and
the
court
has
since
added
that
the
choice
of
means
for
pursuing
constitutionally
delegated
objectives
is
a
matter
primarily
to
the
judgment
of
congress.
now
the
statute
before
us
in
our
review
meets
all
these
criteria
and
any
other
related
criteria.
congress
certainly
can
enact
criminal
laws
necessary
and
proper
to
the
execution
of
specifically
enumerated
power,
such
as
the
commerce
power
and
the
post
office
power,
so
forth.
thus
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
authorizes
the
enactment
of
further
laws
providing
relevant
punishment,
including
prison.
it
authorizes
the
enactment
of
more
detailed
laws
providing
say
for
the
training
of
federal
prisoners
for
work
after
release
or
otherwise
preparing
prisoners
for
relief
including
laws
that
say
just
when
and
under
what
circumstances
prisoners
will
be
released,
once
their
prison
terms
have
expired.
in
a
word,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
provides
authority
for
congress
to
enact
detailed
legislation
dealing
with
a
host
of
subsidiary
matters,
concerning
the
implementation
of
programs
that
are
properly
the
subject
of
legislation
under
article
1,
that
is
what
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
is
all
about.
to
return
to
the
present
case,
in
our
view,
given
the
constitution's
authority
to
enact
criminal
laws,
to
provide
for
prisons
and
to
set
forth
the
details
of
prison
administration,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
also
provides
authority
for
a
federal
law
permitting
the
attorney
general
to
set
forth
the
terms
of
the
federal
prisoners
release,
including
the
authority
to
provide
for
continued
confinement
even
after
expiration
of
his
prison
term
in
appropriate
circumstances.
imagine
for
an
example,
an
instance
where
prison
was
too
ill
to
leave
the
prison
hospital.
similarly,
no
one
doubts
that
the
clause
would
authorize
a
law
permitting
the
authorities
to
retain
a
prisoner
who
had
a
severe
communicable
disease
that
might
threaten
the
community
and
as
far
as
basic
constitutional
authority
is
concerned,
we
can
see
no
significant
difference
between
the
last
mentioned
case
of
a
prisoner
ill,
was
say
communicable
tuberculosis
and
a
prisoner
who
is
mentally
ill
and
dangerous
to
himself
or
to
others.
at
the
same
time
the
statute
before
us
is
narrowly
drawn
so
as
not
to
impinge
unreasonably
upon
the
authority
of
the
states.
it
permits
federal
authorities
to
detain
the
mentally
ill
and
dangerous
individual,
only
if
the
state
where
the
individual
was
domiciled,
or
where
he
was
tried
refuses
to
do
so,
and
it
permits
federal
detention
only
until
that
person
is
no
longer
dangerous
or
a
state
will
assume
responsibility
for
his
custody,
care
and
treatment.
we
explore
these
matters
further
in
our
opinion,
where
we
also
refer
to
president
in
support
of
our
conclusions.
we
do
not
consider
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
for
other
reasons
related
for
example
to
due
process
guarantees
for
those
other
matters
are
not
before
us.
we
reverse
the
contrary
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
concurs
in
part.
