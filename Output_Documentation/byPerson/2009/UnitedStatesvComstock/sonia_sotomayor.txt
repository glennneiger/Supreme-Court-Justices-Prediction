justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
your
theory
--
under
the
theory
that
you
are
proposing,
then,
any
dangerous
person,
whether
it's
because
of
mental
illness
or
any
other
reason,
could
be
held
indefinitely--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--under
a
civil
commitment
statute,
because
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
federal
government,
merely
because
of
their
--
their
time
in
control
of
the
individual,
has
an
unlimited
constitutional
power
to
then
civilly
commit
this
dangerous
person.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what
--
what
constrains
the
government
under
the
due
process
clause
from
invoking
a
dangerousness
merely
because
someone
has
a
long
history.
we
have
many
criminal
defendants
with
long
histories
of
violent
behavior.
many
of
them
continue
that
violent
behavior
in
prison,
and
some
of
them
at
the
end
of
their
term
are
let
out,
because
their
term
has
been
completed.
so
what
--
what
in
the
due
process
clause
protects--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that's
where
i'm
trying
to
understand--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
connection
between
the
nature
of
the
mental
illness
and
the
constitutional
power
that
you
are
claiming.
what
--
what
is
it
that
gives
you
that
power?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
--
but
that's
an
easier
case,
because
at
least
you
have
an
interstate
connection
to
the
offensive
conviction
and
the
ground
for
future
commitment.
but
these
statutes
don't
depend
on
that
element
being
a
part
of
the
commitment
process.
there's
no
--
there's
no
congressional
--
there's
no
tie
to
a
congressional
power
that
justifies
the
commitment
other
than
that
the
person
is
sexually
dangerous.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
that
special
relationship.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
doesn't
take
care
of
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
would
be
released
before
there
was
a
cure
found
for
the
alleged
mental
illness,
meaning
supervised
release
generally
has
a
term
limit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
--
what
would
happen
if
congress
said,
as
part
of
a
sentence,
a
judge
could
incorporate
a
civil
commitment
finding
and
say:
you
are
going
to
serve
x
amount
in
jail
and
y
amount,
and
then
we
are
going
to
civilly
commit
you
indefinitely,
because
as
of
today,
i
am
finding
you
a
sexual
predator
subject
to
a
mental
illness.
would
that
be
constitutional,
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
--
let's
assume
it
incorporates
all
the
protections
of
--
of
this
statute
with
respect
to
periodic
review.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
constitutional
because
it's
part
of
the
sentence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
because
it's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
so
that
would
be
true
whether
or
not
you
were
convicted
of
a
sex
crime
or
a
tax
crime
or
any
other
crime,
so
long
as
the
judge
was
making
a
finding
that
this
was
necessary
to
protect
the
public?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
what
you're
saying
is,
then,
that
the
nexus
is
--
the
nexus
with
the
need
for
the
criminal
justice
system
or
the
proper
and
necessary
power
to
address
this
problem
ends
at
the
point
of
sentencing,
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
says
that
it
exists
as
a
result
of
its
control
over
this
individual,
its
special
relationship,
and
the
fact
that
at
the
end
of
the
sentence,
it
has
an
obligation
to
the
public.
