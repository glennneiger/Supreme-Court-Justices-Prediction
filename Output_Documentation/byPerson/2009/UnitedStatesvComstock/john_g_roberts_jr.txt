chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1224,
united
states
v.
comstock.
general
kagan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
say
that
the
federal
government
has
no
such
power
independent
of
the
criminal
conviction?
in
other
words,
that
congress
could
not
pass
a
law
saying,
just
as
this
one
says,
we
are
going
to
commit
people
who
are
sexually
dangerous
until
a
determination
that
they
are
not
or
until
the
state
can
take
them?
that
power
would
not
be
in
article
i?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
this
power
is
necessary
and
proper,
given
the
fact
that
the
person
is
in
federal
custody
for
some
other
reason,
criminal
conviction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't
the
federal
government's
authority
to
have
custody
because
of
the
criminal
justice
system
end
when
the
criminal
justice
system
is
exhausted?
in
other
words,
when
the
sentence
is
done?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
there
were--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but,
general--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
understood
you
in
your
response
to
justice
alito
to
say,
if
i
remember,
that
it
was
not
just
the
fact
of
federal
custody,
but
the
fact
that
there
are
no
states
or
there
may
well
often
be
no
states
willing.
what
if
every
state
is
willing;
i
mean,
every
state
is
willing
to
take
the
people
on
out
of
a
concern
to
protect
their
citizens.
does
that
somehow
mean
there's
no
necessary
and
proper
power?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
it
wouldn't
be
necessary,
is
what
you
are
saying?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thanks
for
thinking
it
was
a
promotion.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
dubois.
is
it
"due-bwah"
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mr.
dubois.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he's
not
going
to
be
cavalier.
he
doesn't
have
--
he's
going
to
say:
don't
do
it.
this
is
a
dangerous
person,
the
federal
government;
don't
release
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
want
the
federal
government
to
have
to
be
in
the
position
of
saying,
well,
we
have
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
may
be
the
federal
government's
hard
political
position.
they
are
the
person
holding
them,
and
the
attorney
general
is
saying,
don't
release
him,
and
then
the
federal
government
is
going
to
make
the
decision,
well,
we
have
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dubois.
general
kagan,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
in
this
morning
in
case
08-1224
united
states
versus
comstock.
