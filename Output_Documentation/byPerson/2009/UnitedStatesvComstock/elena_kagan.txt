ms.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
article
i
of
the
constitution
permits
congress
to
enact
section
4248,
which
is
the
limited
federal
civil
commitment
statute
at
issue
in
this
case.
to
see
why,
to
understand
the
basis
for
this
statute,
it
might
be
helpful
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
1945,
when
what
this
court
later
called
"a
conspicuously
able
committee
of
federal
judges.
"
recommended
that
congress
pass
section
4246,
a
very
similar
civil
commitment
law
that
has
been
on
the
books
for
some
60
years.
the
committee
there
wrote
that
the
law
was
necessary
to
deal
with
what
it
called
the
serious
problem
of
what
to
do
with
insane
criminals
--
and
i'm
quoting
now
--
"upon
the
expiration
of
their
terms
of
confinement,
where
it
would
be
dangerous
to
turn
them
loose
upon
society
and
where
no
state
will
assume
responsibility
for
their
custody.
"
that
is
exactly
what
congress
concluded
here.
congress
could
reasonably
find
that
section
4248
was
necessary
to
prevent
a
similar
problem.
the
federal
government
has
mentally
ill,
sexually
dangerous
persons
in
its
custody.
it
knows
that
those
persons,
if
released,
will
commit
serious
sexual
offenses;
and
it
knows
too
that
states
are
often
not
in
a
position
to
deal
with
such
dangers,
not
in
a
position
to
take
custody
and
care
and
responsibility
for
those
persons
upon
release
from
federal
prison.
this
is
essentially
a
transitional
problem
that
the
court
was
--
that
the
congress
was
dealing
with,
how
to
manage
the
transition
from
federal
custody
to
state
superintendence
and
responsibility.
ms.
elena
kagan
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
in
fact,
what
the
statute
requires
is
for
the
attorney
general
really
to
--
immediately
upon
commitment,
to
go
to
a
state,
if
he
hasn't
done
so
beforehand
--
to
go
to
two
states,
the
state
of
domicile
and
the
state
of
prior
conviction.
ms.
elena
kagan
well--
ms.
elena
kagan
--what
congress
found
was
that
states
often
were
not
willing
to
incur
that
extra
expense,
even
if
the
federal
government
was
not
going
to
do
that
for
them,
and
what
this
legislation
was,
was
a
response
to
that
reality.
it
was--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
it
is
unusual,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
not
the
usual
course
that
the
state
does
take
responsibility.
but
the
federal
statute
commits
the
attorney
general
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
try
to
persuade
a
state
to
take
custody,
to
defer
to
the
state
if
a
state
has
some
reason
to
take
custody,
but
--
but
makes
sure
that
the
federal
government
is
a
kind
of
backstop,
so
that
if
the
state
does
not
take
responsibility
and
does
not
take
custody,
the
federal
government
will
ensure
that
the
person
will
not
be
released,
the
person
who
has
been
found
to
be
both
mentally
ill
and
sexually--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
that
that's
fair,
that
the
likelihood
is
that
the
person
will
stay
in
federal
custody
until
such
time
as
a
court
finds
that
the
reasons
for
that
custody
have
lapsed.
but,
again,
the
state
always
has
the
ability
to
come
in
and
say:
we
would
like
to
take
control
over
this
person.
and
more
to
the
point,
the
attorney
general
has
the
responsibility
to
keep
going
to
the
state
and
to
try
to
see
if
he
can
transfer
custody
to
the
state.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think
the
power,
justice
scalia,
is
the
power
to
run
a
responsible
criminal
justice
system,
to
run
a
criminal
justice
system
that
does
not
itself
endanger
the
public.
ms.
elena
kagan
without
the
person
having
entered
the
criminal
justice
system
in
any
way.
ms.
elena
kagan
that
has
been
the
government's
case
throughout
this
litigation,
that
it
has
always
depended
on
the
fact
of
federal
custody,
on
the
fact
that
this
person
has
entered
the
criminal
justice
system,
has
been
--
four
of
the
five
of
these
people--
ms.
elena
kagan
--have
been
convicted
and
have
served
prison
terms.
and
the
question
really
is,
well,
given
that,
given
that
the
federal
government
has
custody
of
these
people,
that
it's
difficult
for
the
states
to
--
to
take
responsibility
for
these
people
after
the
prison
term
is
finished.
ms.
elena
kagan
because
the
federal
government
has
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
release
of
the
people
it
has
in
its
custody
is
done
responsibly,
is
done
in
such
a
way--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
that
the
power
to
run
a
responsible
criminal
justice
system
extends
to
the
way
in
which
the
federal
government
releases
these
prisoners.
and--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case.
there
are
some
people,
of
course,
who
are
on
supervised
release
and,
for
example--
ms.
elena
kagan
--okay.
well,
i'll
grab
your
difficult
hypo,
then.
and
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
that
the
federal
government
would
not
have
the
--
the
power
to
commit
a
person
who
is
--
has
been
released
from
prison
and
whose
period
of
supervised
release
is
also
completed.
at
that
point,
the
release
has
been
--
the
transfer
to
state
responsibility
and
state
control
has
occurred,
and
the
federal
government
would
have
no
appropriate
role.
ms.
elena
kagan
yes,
i
think
that
that's
correct,
that
at
that
point
the
state
police
power
over
a
person
has
been
fully
reestablished.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think
that
that's
not
right,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
there
is
a
transition
period,
and
what
this
statute
is
designed
to
do
is
to
deal
with
that
transition
period
and
to
make
sure
that
sexually
dangerous,
mentally
ill
people
don't
fall
through
the
cracks
between
federal
custody
and
the
reestablishment
of
state
control.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think
congress
could
reasonably
find
that
that
is
insufficient.
congress
could
reasonably
find
that
the
state
--
that
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
individual
has
been
sufficiently
disrupted
as
a
result
of
what
is
in
many
of
these
cases
an
extended
period
of
federal
custody,
that
it's
not
so
easy
to
establish
--
reestablish
it
all
at
once.
and
i
would
point
to
you
as
proof
of
this
the
supervised
release
system
itself.
ms.
elena
kagan
no--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
what
would
prevent
that,
justice
sotomayor,
is
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
obviously
the
case
that
there
are
other
constraints
on
governmental
action
than
article
i.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
that
the
history
of
this
court's
cases
would
suggest
that
if
this
were
a
person
without
mental
illness
that
the
civil
commitment
statutes--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes,
that
the
civil--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
if
you
go
back
to
a
case
like
kansas
v.
hendricks,
which
is
of
course
where
this
court
thought
about
civil
commitment
statutes
with
relation
to
sexually
dangerous
offenders,
i
think
the
court
made
clear
that
it
was
important
in
that
case
that
there
be
not
only
sexual
dangerousness,
but
also
mental
illness,
in
order
to
invoke
the
civil
commitment
statutes.
ms.
elena
kagan
you
said
it
better
than
i
did,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
exactly
right,
that
of
course
there
are
constraints
on
the
federal
government
in
using
civil
commitment
statutes,
that
they
are
the
same
as
the
--
the
constitutional
constraints
on
the
states
when
they
use
that
power.
but
this
is
a
different
question.
the
question
presented
here
is
only
whether
--
assuming
that
the
federal
government
is
acting
within
other
constitutional
constraints
in
making
this
civil
commitment,
whether
article
i
enables
it
to
do
so
because
of
the
special
custodial
role
in
these
cases.
and--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
court
has
always
said,
justice
scalia,
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
the
question
is,
is
it
necessary
and
proper
to
the
beneficial
exercise
of
federal
powers?
and
so
this
is,
that
it
is
necessary
and
proper
to
the
beneficial
or,
what
i
said
before,
the
responsible
exercise
of
the
federal
power
to
operate
a
criminal
justice
system,
which
includes
the
responsibility
to
ensure
that
those
people
who
have
been
in
custody
in
that
federal
--
in
that
criminal
justice
system
are
not
released
irresponsibly.
ms.
elena
kagan
just
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
the
question,
that
the
reason
for
the
enactment
in
part
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
assumed
custodial
responsibility
and
has
disrupted
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
citizen,
i
think
that
that's
exactly
right,
justice
alito.
but
in
some
sense,
it's
not
just
that
the
federal
system
finds
itself
in
possession
and
custody
of
these
people,
but
the
federal
--
what
congress
could
reasonably
find
is
that
the
federal
government
knows
that
there's
nobody
else
to
take
appropriate
custody
and
care
and
that
the
reason
that
there's
nobody
else
to
take
appropriate
custody
and
care
has
to
do
with
the
federal
action
itself.
ms.
elena
kagan
the
default
position
is
that
the
prisoner
is
released
to
the
place
where
the
prisoner
was
convicted.
now,
that
--
the
prisoner
may
or
may
not
have
any
relationship
with
that
state.
the
person
may
have
lived
there,
may
not
have
lived
there.
the
--
the
federal
prison
system
does
sometimes
make
other
arrangements.
the
idea
behind
any
release
is
to
try
to
make
sure
that
the
person
is
released
to
the
place
where
a
--
a
future
lawful
life
will
be
most
likely.
but
in
many
of
these
cases,
the
prisoner
ends
up
being
released
to
a
state
that
has
no
current
relationship
with
the
--
with
the
prisoner,
sometimes
has
had
--
never
had
any
relationship
with
the
prisoner,
and
at
any
rate
doesn't
now,
because
the
period
of
federal
custody
has
disrupted
that
relationship.
and
what
the
federal
government
is
doing
here
is
essentially
to
deal
with
this
transition
problem
to
make
--
to
make
sure
these
people
don't
fall
between
the
--
the
cracks,
and
to
ensure
that
where
there
is
a
sexually
violent
and
mentally
ill
person
who
one
has
reason
to
believe
will
commit
further
offenses,
that
appropriate
care
and
custody
of
those
people
is
ensured.
now,
this
is
no
different
from
what
congress
has
done
on
other
occasions
as
well.
this
is
not
the
first
such
federal
civil
commitment
statute.
this
is
not
a
newfangled
thing.
section
4248
is
identical
in
--
in
all
relevant
constitutional
respects
to
section
4246,
which
is
the
general
civil
commitment
statute
for
mentally
ill,
dangerous
people
generally,
not
with
any
sexual--
ms.
elena
kagan
--component
to
it.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
we
are
asking
ourselves
whether
congress
reasonably
acted
in
a
given
situation--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
if
--
if
--
that's
exactly
right,
that
if
the
facts
before
congress
were
such
that
there
were
no
difficulty
with
this
transition
period
and
that
nobody
ever
fell
between
the
cracks,
an
entirely
different
question
would
be
presented,
and
then
there
would
be
some
kind
of
argument
that
at
that
point,
in
those
circumstances
state
police
power
would
be
the
appropriate
default
position.
but--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
do
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
congress
reasonably
could
have
found
that
there
were
difficulties
in
making
this
transition.
the
cost
of
commitment
of
these
people
is
very
high,
much
higher
than
standard
incarceration.
i
believe
the
states
say
in
their
amicus
brief
that
it's
some
$65,000
a
year
per
person
per
year,
and
--
and
the
state
may
feel
as
though
it
shouldn't
have
responsibility
over
this
person--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
think
people
--
people
make
judgments--
ms.
elena
kagan
--people
make
judgments
all
the
time.
and
i
think
there's
--
there's
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
congress
was
not
acting
reasonably
in
understanding
this
as
a
significant
problem.
and--
ms.
elena
kagan
--that
is
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
maybe
that's
the
--
the
best
answer
to
justice
scalia,
is
history,
and
it's
history
on
two
separate
occasions,
which
this
court
has
noted.
it's
history
when
--
when
this
committee
of
federal
judges
chaired
by
calvert
magruder,
including
learned
hand,
said
we
have
a
real
problem
here
with
people
being
let
go
out
of
the
federal
system
and
the
states
not
stepping
forward
and
taking
responsibility
for
them.
and
the
court
confronted
and
--
and
thought
about
the
exact
same
problem
when
congress
passed
in
1984
section
4243,
which
is
the
civil
commitment
statute
that
applies
to
insanity
acquittees,
people
who
are
acquitted
on
the
basis
of
insanity.
and
this
court
in
shannon
said
that,
i
think
the
--
the
language
is,
"federal
courts
decried
time
and
again
the
gaping
statutory
hole.
"
that
is
the
hole
that
--
that
existed
because
people
were
acquitted
on
the
basis
of
insanity
and
--
and
states
were
not
willing
to
step
forward
and
take
custody
of
those
people
in
the
way
that
they
would
have
taken
custody
of
those
people
if
they
had
been
acquitted
of
insanity
in
the
state
court
systems.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
can
tell,
justice
scalia.
ms.
elena
kagan
no,
i--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
i
think,
in
fact,
that
--
that
congress
on
each
of
these
three
occasions
has
limited
the
civil
commitment
power
only
to
people
who
have
been
--
who
are
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
government
and
over
whom
the
federal
government
has
a
distinctive
responsibility.
i
will
give
you
an
example,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
suppose
that
there
was
some
very
contagious
form
of
drug-resistant
tuberculosis
that
had
--
had
become
prevalent
in
the
prison
system,
and
states
were
not
able
to
deal
with
that,
with
quarantining
these
people
upon
their
release
date,
and
congress
said:
you
know,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
have
the
federal
government
act
as
the
appropriate
quarantining
authority
because
we
don't
think
that
states
are
able
to
step
up
and
deal
with
this
problem.
would
anybody
say
that
the
federal
government
would
not
have
article
i
power
to
effect
that
kind
of
public
safety
measure?
and
the
exact
same
thing
is
true
here.
this
is
exactly
what
congress
is
doing
here,
is
to
make
sure
that
mentally
ill,
sexually
dangerous--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
as
you
say,
justice
kennedy,
the
government
has
never
argued
the
commerce
clause
here
in
the
sense
that
it
has
never
argued
that
these
activities
have
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
and
it
hasn't
done
so
because
of
the
morrison
--
the
morrison
precedent.
the
commerce
clause
i
think
is
relevant
in
two
ways.
it's
relevant
first
because,
of
course,
it's
often
the
commerce
clause
that
gives
rise
to
the
power
to
criminalize
conduct
and
to
punish
people
for
that
conduct.
so
i
think
in
--
in
three
of
the
five
of
these
cases,
the
initial
power
to
criminalize
the
conduct
is
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
the
commerce
clause
is
also
relevant
here
because
the
commerce
clause
does
give
rise
to
a
set
of
federal
laws
having
to
do
with
sexual
offenses,
sexual
solicitation
of
a
minor,
sexual
exploitation
of
a
minor
when
interstate
commerce
is
involved,
and
when
the
internet
is
involved.
and
we
do
think
that
that
provides
an
additional
basis,
not
a
sufficient
basis,
but
an
additional
basis
to
--
to
approve
this
law
in
the
sense
that
these
are
the
people
who
are
most
likely,
really,
to
violate
such
federal
laws
which
are
based
on
the
commerce
clause
in
the
future.
and
the
reason
they
are
most
likely
is
because
all
of
them
have
done
it
once
before,
and
all
of
them
have
been
found
to
have
the
kind
of
mental
illness
that
makes
it--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
--
the
essential
tie
to
a
congressional
power
is
the
tie
of
these
people
to
the
federal
criminal
justice
system
because
they
are
in
federal
custody.
ms.
elena
kagan
that's
--
that's
right.
and
in
addition
to
that,
these
are
the
people
who
are
most
likely
to
violate
federal
laws
based
on
the
commerce
clause
in
the
future
--
most
likely
to
violate
such
laws
because
they
have
done
so
in
the
past
and
because
they
have
mental
conditions
that
make
it
extremely
difficult--
ms.
elena
kagan
--it
--
it
does,
justice
stevens.
there
have
been
103--
ms.
elena
kagan
--just
to
put
some
numbers
on
the
table,
there
have
been
103
people
who
have
been
certified
under
these
laws.
eight
under
--
under
this
law.
eighty-three
of
them
have
committed
sexual
offenses;
20--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes,
yes,
that's
right.
as
i
was
saying,
20
of
these
people
fall
within
that
category,
that
--
that
they
are
in
prison
for
a
nonsexual
offense.
ms.
elena
kagan
all
of
those
people
have
had
prior
sexual
convictions
in
their
history.
ms.
elena
kagan
what
is
necessary
is
two
things:
first,
that
the
person
in
fact
have
engaged
in
sexually
violent
behavior
or
child
molestation.
so
there's
a
factual
predicate
there.
and
--
and
so
far,
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
found
that
about
15,000
people
whom
it
has
reviewed
meet
that
factual
predicate.
of
those,
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
certified
only
105
of
those,
who
were
also
found
to
have
the
kind
of
mental
illness
that
made
it
reasonably
likely
that
--
that
they
would
continue
to
commit
this
--
these
kinds
of
offenses.
ms.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
--
excuse
me,
justice
scalia
--
i
didn't
mean
to
promote
you
quite
so
quickly.
[laughter]
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
scalia,
i
--
i
do
think
that
the
military
has
special
responsibilities
with
respect
to
those
people
in
it.
in
general,
i
would
say
that
the
relationship
between
a
prisoner
and
a
--
and
a
jailer
is
more
comprehensive
than
any
other
kind
of
relationship
that
one
can
name.
but
i
do
think
that
the
military
relationship
approaches
that.
and
in
the
military,
i
think
the
military
indeed
would
take
this
kind
of
--
these
kinds
of
facts
extremely
seriously,
probably
would
commit
such
a
person
and
--
and
try
very
hard
to
transfer
that
person
eventually
to
state
custody.
if
i
can
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
elena
kagan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
congress
said
here
was
something
pretty
simple
and
very
reasonable.
it
said
if
we,
the
federal
government,
have
somebody
in
our
custody,
and
we
know
that
that
person
has
the
kind
of
mental
illness
that's
going
to
cause
grave
danger
to
the
community,
and
we
know
that
there
is
no
one
else
who
is
in
a
good
position
to
prevent
it,
and
we
know
that
we
are
in
part
responsible
for
that
vacuum,
then
we
should
be
able
to
do
something
about
it.
that's
what
section
4248
says,
and
section
4248
is
constitutional
for
that
reason.
justice
scalia
has
several
times
suggested
that
maybe
there
is
no
experience
of
this,
but
i
think
that
the
facts
of
the
judicial
conference
committee
report,
stating
that
there
were
these
problems
with
respect
to
mentally
ill
people
generally,
rebuts
that.
so,
too,
this
court's
view
in
shannon,
that
section
4243
was
necessary
because
there
was
a
gaping
statutory
hole
where
states
were
not
willing
to
step
forward,
rebuts
that
as
well.
in
fact,
it
is
not
and
has
never
been
the
case
that
the
test
here
is
whether
a
government
action
is
absolutely
necessary
to
aid
or
effect
a
governmental
or
congressional
power.
the
wisdom
of
the
statute
here
is
not
what's
at
issue:
maybe
this
is
the
right
statute;
maybe
there
might
be
a
better
one.
the
only
question
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
that
sort
of
wisdom,
whether
there
might
be
a
better
statute,
that's
for
congress
to
decide.
