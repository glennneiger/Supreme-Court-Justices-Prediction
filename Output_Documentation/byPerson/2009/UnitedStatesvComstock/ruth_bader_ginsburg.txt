justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
experience
under
4246?
you
pointed
out
that
that
has
been
on
the
books
for
some
time,
and
there
efforts
must
be
made
to
have
the
state
take
the
person.
when
the
civil
commitment
is
used
following
the
end
of
a
term
--
let's
say
someone
is
insane
--
how
often
does
it
end
up
that
the
state
takes
responsibility
and
how
often
is
it
that
the
person
stays
in
federal
custody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
likelihood
is
that
the
person
will
stay
in
federal
custody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
as
far
as
those
limitations,
the
question
that
justice
sotomayor
was
asking,
the
limitations
on
the
federal
government
would
be
the
same
as
they
are
on
the
states?
but
that's
a
different
question
from
whether
the
federal
government
has
any
power
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
is
the
prisoner--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
it
--
is
it
a
prisoner
who
has
served
his
time
in,
say,
a
federal
penitentiary
in
ohio
but
is
a
domiciliary
of
arizona,
what
happens
when
the
prisoner
is
released,
say,
after
10
years?
released
to
ohio,
sent
back
to
arizona?
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
--
was
that
a
consideration?
you
mentioned
that
this
originated,
4246,
with
a
--
with
a
committee
of
judges
who
said,
we
have
a
problem.
did
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
--
mr.
dubois,
do
you
take
that
same
position
with
respect
to
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity?
someone
is
convicted,
say,
in
the
district
of
columbia
--
say,
john
hinckley
is
found
by
the
jury
to
be
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
must
he
then
be
allowed
out
of
federal
custody,
and
it
depends
if
his
home
state
or
any
other
state
wants
to
pick
him
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
what's
the
power
that
the
federal
government
is
exercising
when
it
commits
someone
who
has
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
more
than
the
question
of
good
idea.
you're
talking
about
endangering
the
health
and
safety
of
people,
so
it's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
government
has
some
responsibility,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
say,
if
the
state
is
unwilling
to
take
the
person,
and
apparently,
that
is
the
problem
that
precipitated
4246
and,
now,
4248,
and
that
--
you
--
the
federal
government
is
just
helpless
short
of
passing
a
spending
measure
and
saying,
state,
if
you
do
this,
we'll
give
you
the
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
you
mention
in
your
brief.
you
said
you
could
vary
the
conditions
of
supervised
release,
but
you
were
not
at
all
specific
about
that.
you
said
the
federal
government
--
the
person
has
gotten
out,
they
know
the
person
is
dangerous,
so
what
--
what
are
the
measures
that
they
would
take
to
do
what
you
said
in
the
brief
the
federal
government
could
do;
that
is,
set
the
terms
of
supervised
release
in
order
to
account
for
sexual
dangerousness?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
would
the
modification
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
someone
who
is
incompetent
to
stand
trial?
i
take
it
you
think
that
that's
a
perfectly
proper
application
of
4246?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
matter
that
the
person
who
has
been
found
incompetent
to
stand
trial
has
now
been
in
custody
for
three
times
longer
than
the
maximum
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
it
may
be
purely
imaginary;
that
is,
that
this
particular
person,
all
of
the
experts
agree,
will
never
be
competent
to
stand
trial.
