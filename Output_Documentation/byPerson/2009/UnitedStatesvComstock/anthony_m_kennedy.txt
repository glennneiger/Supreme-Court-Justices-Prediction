justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
that
you
can
be
committed
to
federal
custody
for,
say,
a
year
and
then
the
state
takes
it
over?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
would
a
state
want
to
incur
that
extra
expense
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
the
federal
government
is
going
to
do
it
for
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
federal
government
order
a
commitment
of
anyone
who's
been
in
federal
custody
over
the
last
10
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no.
that
makes
your
--
my
hypo
too
easy
for
you.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
must
be
because
there
is
a
lack
of
federal
power.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
brief
--
excuse
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
when
i
was
thinking
about
your
hypothetical,
i
thought,
well,
that's
a
pretty
easy
commerce
power
argument.
i
--
i
notice
that
in
--
in
the
government's
position,
you
don't
argue
the
commerce
clause
very
much,
and
i
--
we've
got
morrison
v.
brzonkala
looking
at
you
and
printz
and
so
forth.
but
it
--
suppose
congress
said
there
is
a
class
of
committable,
dangerous
sex
offenders
that
are
crossing
state
lines
and
using
interstate
facilities,
and
made
those
findings.
would
that
be
sufficient
to
establish
a
federal
commitment
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
hear.
you
think
they
have
a
power
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
the
government--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
suppose,
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
he
caught
the
communicable
disease
in
the
prison
as
a
result
of
poor
prison
conditions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
the
hypothetical
is
that
his
sentence
ends,
and
they
want
to
commit
him
to
a
federal
health
facility.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
is
--
there
is
in
the
sense
that
the
relation
between
the
prisoner
and
his
or
her
state
is
disrupted
for,
say,
15
years,
and
then
this
person
is
just
a
derelict.
