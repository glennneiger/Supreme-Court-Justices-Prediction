justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
the
case
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
i
was
going
to
ask,
is
it
the
case
that
the
unwillingness
of
states
to
step
into
this
area
in
these
instances
is
a
consequence,
at
least
in
part
and
perhaps
in
large
part,
of
the
federal
incarceration,
that
as
a
result
of
the
federal
incarceration,
the
person
is
no
longer
viewed
by
the
state
as
--
as
having
domicile
within
the
state,
the
state
of
prior
domicile
has
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
person
would
return
to
a
domicile
in
the
prior
state?
is
that
--
do
you
think
that
is
a
fair
understanding
of
the
reason
for
the
enactment
of
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
the
congress
has
the
power
to
remedy
problems
that
are
caused
by
the
operation
of
the
federal
prison
system,
caused
by
incarceration?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
general
proposition
that
if
--
if
the
incarceration
causes
a
problem,
then
the
federal
government
has
the
power,
ancillary
to
the
power
to
operate
the
--
the
criminal
justice
system,
to
remedy
the
problems
that
it
has
caused
by
the
incarceration?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
does
it
end
at
that
point?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
the
person
is
simply
injured
in
prison
as
a
result
of,
let's
say,
an
attack
by
another
prisoner,
and
now
the
sentence
expires.
the
federal
government
has
no
power
to
set
up
hospitals
or
facilities
to
care
for
that
person
for
the
duration
of
the
--
of
the
injury
that's
--
that
was
caused
during
the
period
of
incarceration?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
explain
why
the
constitutional
power
that
provides
the
basis
for
a
federal
criminal
conviction
is
exhausted
at
the
end
of
the
--
either
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
congress
chooses
to
establish
when
it
enacts
the
statute
or
at
the
end
of
the
particular
term
that
is
given
to
this
prisoner?
i
understand
why
it's
relevant
for
statutory
purposes.
it
may
be
relevant
for
other
constitutional
purposes
--
double
jeopardy
and
due
process
--
but
why
as
a
--
why
does
the
power,
the
commerce
clause
power,
the
power
to
make
rules
for
federal
property
and
so
forth,
why
is
that
exhausted
at
the
end
of
the
--
either
of
those
two
periods?
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
only
to
the
extent
that
that's
what
the
statute
says.
take
whatever
the
offense
is,
would
it
be
a
violation
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause?
let's
say
it's
a
commerce
--
it's
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
would
congress
exceed
it's
powers
under
the
commerce
clause
if
it
imposed
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole?
i
mean
it
raises
other
constitutional
questions,
but
why
does
it
raise
a
question
as
to
the
extent
of
the
power
that's
being
exercised
by
--
by
congress?
