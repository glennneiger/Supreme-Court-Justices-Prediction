mr.
mark
h.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
plaintiff's
counsel
in
this
case
earned
a
large
fee
award
based
on
prevailing
market
hourly
rates
and
a
substantial
number
of
hours
expended.
however,
the
district
court
determined
that
the
$6
million
lodestar
was
insufficient
to
compensate
them
for
the
quality
of
their
representation
or
their
results
obtained.
this
court
has
previously
held
that
factors,
such
as
novelty
and
complexity
of
the
issues,
contingency,
and
superior
performance
cannot
be
used
to
increase
the
lodestar
amount
because
the
factors
are
subsumed
within
that
determination.
but
because
of
this
court's
indication
that,
in
rare
or
exceptional
circumstances,
upward
adjustments
may
be
permissible,
district
courts,
such
as
the
one
below,
have
used
quality
and
results
to
increase
lodestar
awards,
even
though
the
--
the
multiplication
of
the
reasonable
number
of
hours
expended
times
the
reasonable
hourly
rate
constitutes
a
fully
compensatory
fee
and
serves
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
attract
competent
counsel
without
providing
a
windfall.
now,
with
respect
to
quality
of
representation,
that
normally
involves
two
factors:
the
skill
and
experience
of
the
attorney,
and
also
the
effort
it
takes
to
succeed
in
the
case.
in
this
case,
the
lead
counsel
submitted
affidavits
indicating
that
they
sought
hourly
rates
that
were
within
the
prevailing
market
rates
in
the
atlanta
market;
and,
in
fact,
lead
counsel's
market
rate,
the
court
found,
was
at
the
upper
end
of
that
market.
when
the
district
court
determined--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--it
was
the
market
for
attorneys
with
similar
skill
or
experience
doing
similar
work
as
these
counsel
did.
so
what
the
court--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--similar
work
would
be
federal
court
work,
where
you
--
involving
class
actions,
for
example.
but
the
focus
is
mostly
on
the
skill
and
experience
and
reputation
of
the
attorney.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
what
the
court
did
in
this
case,
though,
was,
rather
than
take
those
hourly
rates,
which
were
prevailing,
which
the
record
was
clear
were
prevailing,
the
court
determined
the
quality
factor
justified
an
increase
because
they
advanced
case
expenses,
because
they
were
not
paid
on
an
ongoing
basis,
and
because
their
fees
were
contingent
upon
the
success
of
the
case.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
well,
for
whatever
reason,
the
court
determined
to
use
contingency-related
factors
to
increase
the
fee
award
based
on
the
quality
factor.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
correct.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
and
the
third
one
was
that
they
weren't
paid
on
an
ongoing
basis.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
that's
right.
but
that
is
not
a
rare--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
it's
not
a
rare
or
exceptional
circumstance
when
you're
talking
about
a
fee-shifting
statute.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
he
did
say
that
they
exhibited
the
best
skill
and
professionalism,
justice
ginsburg,
that
he
had
seen
in
his
time
on
the
bench.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
that
is
not
a
reason
to
enhance
the
lodestar
because--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor,
because,
if
that
$200-an-hour
associate
was
doing
other
work
for
other
clients,
the
bill
would
be
for
$200
an
hour,
regardless
of
what
the
result
would
have
been
or
how
good
that
associate
would
have
been.
it's
basically--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--what
i
meant
by
that
position
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
was
that,
in
presenting
affidavits
to
support
the
hourly
rate
of
that
associate,
that
associate
may
present
hourly
affidavits
that
the
rate
was
between
$200
and
$300
per
hour,
and
the
judge
could
determine,
because
of
how
good
he
did,
i'm
going
to
give
him
at
the
upper
end
of
that
market.
and--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--well,
remember,
your
honor,
that,
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
it
was
said
in
the
congressional
reports
that
they
wanted
to
compensate
for
the
expenditure
of
time
and
to
reimburse
the
plaintiff,
if
you
will,
for
what
the
plaintiff
put
out
in
terms
of
expenses
and
fees.
well,
if
you
are
--
if
you
are
going
to
basically
treat
that
second-year
associate
as
a
15-year
partner
and
award
him
a
$500-an-hour
rate,
what
you
are
actually
doing
is
overcompensating
that
person
for
what
the
expenditure
of
time
was
and
for
what
the
actual
fee
they
would
have
charged
to
their
client
was.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
no,
it
wouldn't--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--and
no
reasonable
law
firm
would
do
that,
which
is
why
a
judge
would
be
beyond
his
discretion
--
or
her
discretion--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--but
those
are
private
agreements
that
are
entered
into
with
a
client.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
that's
not
the
--
i'm
sorry.
that's
not
the
traditional
market,
your
honor.
the
traditional
market
is
the
hourly
rate
that's
envisioned
by
the
lodestar.
we
don't
replicate
all
possible
private
fee
agreements
into
fee-shifting
statutes.
that's
what
this
court
has
said.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
no.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
well,
congress
was--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--i'm
sorry.
congress
also
was
not
thinking
of
replicating
all
possible
private
fee
arrangements
because
they
also
indicated
that
the
--
the
amount
of
the
fee
should
not
be
dependent
on
a
proportion
of
the
damage
award.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
well,
that's
--
in
answer
to
your
hypothetical,
again,
in
the
market
where
you
have
an
hourly
rate
for
an
associate,
that's
the
hourly
rate
that
that
client
is
going
to
be
billed
by
that
law
firm,
and
they
are
not
going
to
have
a
results
fee
or
a
bonus
fee
because
that
attorney
happened
to
do
better.
the
hourly
rates--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--you
don't
in
the
traditional
way
of
billing
that
you
are
talking
about,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
other
thing
to
point
out
is
that
when
the
submissions
are
made
to
the
court,
they
are
supposed
to
be
broken
down
by
tasks
actually.
and
here
the
district
court
considered
the
submissions
not
by
what
lawyer
did
what
task,
but
how
many
hours
were
expended
on
individual
tasks.
and
when
the
court
determined
to
actually
lower
the
amount
because
of
excessive
hours,
they
looked
at
tasks
and
said,
for
summary
judgment,
for
example,
too
many
hours
were
expended.
so
they
--
the
court
doesn't
normally
look
at
lawyer
doing
particular
tasks.
it
looks
at
tasks
being
done
by
the
lawyers
in
general.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
well,
i
would
submit,
though,
that
when
the
judge
decides
how
to
do
the
lodestar
rate,
he
is
looking
at
the
affidavits,
talking
about
what
the
range
of
the
market
is
for
that
area.
he's
also
looking
at
the
number
of
hours
reasonably
expended.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
quality
of
performance
is
built
within,
i
would
say
subsumed
within,
the
hourly
rate
and
the
number
of
hours
expended,
as
this
court
has
said
in
delaware
valley
i.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
well,
but--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--correct.
and--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--but
superior
performance
is
just
the
reason
that
hourly
rates
are
what
they
are.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
pierce
v.
underwood.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
well,
no.
the
--
the
lawyer
doesn't
get
a
fee
in
a
fee-shifting
statute
if
he
loses.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
as
it
is
for
the
normal
lawyer
working
on
a
private
matter
for
a
client.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
they
get
paid
an
hourly
rate
and
it's
win
or
lose.
and
what
the
judge
tried
to
do
here
is
to
say,
well,
i
need
to
give
them
a
little
extra
because
their
winning
this
case
was
dependent
upon
a
contingency,
and
the
factors
that
he
built
into
that
enhancement
were
contingency-related
factors.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
well,
but
in
the
normal
system,
your
honor
--
and
i
would
ask
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
--
that
that
hourly
rate
that
that
first-year
or
second-year
associate
gets
is
the
rate
that
they
bill
their
clients.
they
don't
adjust
it
afterwards
unless
they
have
a
special
fee
arrangement,
as
--
as
justice
sotomayor
said.
they
don't
adjust
it
when
they
send
the
final
bill
and
they
say:
this
associate
is
the
best
--
did
the
best
work
that
you
have
ever
seen,
and
we're
going
to
increase
that
hourly
rate
exponentially
because
of
that
work.
that's
not
the
market
with
respect
to
billable
rates.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
than
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
start
out
with
the
little
joke
that
mr.
clement
made,
is
that
you
get
what
you
pay
for.
you
do
get
what
you
pay
for.
is
because
i
am
getting
paid
half
my
hourly
rate
in
this
case
means
i
exert
half
of
what
i
would
do
for
another
client
who
would
pay
my
full
rate?
no.
because
my
professional
responsibility
is
that
when
i'm
hired
by
a
client
for
an
hourly
rate,
i'm
supposed
to
represent
that
client
zealously
within
the
bounds
of
the
law.
so
to
say
that
in
a
case
like
this
that
these
lawyers
would
have
done
a
different
type
of
job
had
they
not
known
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
quality
enhancement
is
an
insult,
frankly,
to
ms.
lowry
and
her
group,
because
they
do
this
all
the
time.
they
do
it
without
getting
an
enhancement;
they
never
asked
for
one
before.
and,
clearly,
if
this
court
determines
that
a
quality
enhancement
is
going
to
be
available
even
in
rare
or
exceptional
circumstances,
you
are
going
to
have
arbitrary
results
and
you
are
going
to
have
inconsistency
which
the
analytical
part
of
the
lodestar
guards
against.
second
point
i
would
make
is
that
mr.
clement
mentioned
about
the
new
york
rates
and
the
overhead.
that
was
not
the
rationale
for
the
district
court's
awarding
a
quality
--
or
an
enhancement
here.
that
was
not
part
of
it
at
all.
getting
back
to
what
the
court
has
mentioned:
"the
best
lawyer
i
have
ever
seen.
"
look
at
what
the
purpose
of
this
fee-shifting
statute
is.
it's
to
attract
competent
counsel
by
awarding
them
a
reasonable
fee.
what
attorney
is
going
--
who
wouldn't
normally
take
a
civil
rights
case
is
going
to
say:
maybe
i
will
take
it,
because
maybe
the
judge
will
say
i'm
the
best
he's
ever
seen
or
one
of
the
best
i've
ever
seen?
it's
not
a
rational
reason
to
give
out
there
to
attract
competent
counsel.
counsel
are
going
to
take
a
civil
rights
case
because
they
know
if
they
prevail
they
are
going
to
get
their
prevailing
market
rate,
they
are
going
to
get
all
their
hours,
their
reasonable
number
of
hours
put
in.
in
this
case,
it
was
25,000
hours
over
a
3-year
period.
and
they
got
their
reasonable
rates.
the
judge
also
double-counted
for
quality
because
ms.
lowry
got
a
$495
rate
in
part
because
of
her,
quote,
"stellar
performance",
as
the
district
judge
decided.
so
to
count
that
again
by
giving
an
enhancement
is
impermissible
double-counting,
as
this
court
has
held
in
previous
cases,
including
delaware
valley.
finally,
i
would
say
that
the
district
judge's
order
in
this
case,
if
left
undisturbed,
will
create
additional
applications
for
enhancements
and
whether
they
are
granted
or
not,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
the
delaware
valley
ii
case
in
her
concurrence,
it's
not
the
issue
of
the
rarity
of
the
granting
of
the
enhancement.
the
issue
is
the
requesting
of
it.
and
the
requests
are
going
to
come
out
the
wazoo,
and
district
courts
are
going
to
be
deciding
things
arbitrarily
and
on
different
bases.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
would
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
reverse.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
if
you
determine
that
the
enhancement
was--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--we
are
arguing
that
the
enhancement
in
this
case
was
unreasonable,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
--well,
no,
i
understand
that.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
for
quality
or
result.
mr.
mark
h.
cohen
for
those
two
factors.
