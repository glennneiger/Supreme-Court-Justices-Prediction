justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
could
you
repeat
what
the
market
was?
was
it
the
market
for
all
attorneys
or
only
for
attorneys
doing
this
type
of
work?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
you
get
a
second-year
associate
whose
billing
rate
for
2
years
of
experience
is
$200,
and
a
partner's
rate
is
$500,
and
a
judge
says:
this
individual
didn't
perform
like
a
2-year
associate;
he
did
the
quality
and
kind
of
work
of
someone
far
superior
in
years
in
skill
and
experience.
that
would
not,
under
your
argument,
entitle
the
court
to
give
an
enhancement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
haven't
dealt
with
my
hypothetical.
he
didn't
perform
like
a
second-year
associate.
he
performed
like
a
15-year
lawyer.
the
difference
is
not
with
respect
to
skill
and
experience.
it's
with
respect
to
performance.
and
so
what
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
is,
what
you
are
basically
saying,
the
quality
of
that
representation,
even
though
it
reflected
more
than
the
market
one
would
look
at
objectively
on
the
basis
of
the
years
of
experience,
that
judge
can't
enhance,
even
though
someone
performed
far
above
whatever
else
the
market
would
consider
his
or
her
skills
at
the
moment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
not
true.
law
firms
get
bonuses
from
clients
all
the
time.
they
get
negotiated.
some
of
the
amici
gave
examples
of
what's
happening
in
the
--
what
happens
in
the
marketplace.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
can't
the
judge
determine
a
reasonable
fee
in
the
same
way
the
market
does?
which
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no,
but
the
--
but
the
congress
didn't
use
the
per-hour
lodestar--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
the
method.
if
that's
all
it
wanted,
it
could
have,
and
there
were
suggestions
that
it
consider
limiting
the
--
the
award
to
just
a
lodestar
calculation.
so
obviously
congress
was
thinking
of
something
broader
than
just
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
part
of
the
market
anyway.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
that's
why
we
have
held
in
our
cases
that
it
should
be
a
rare
and
exceptional
circumstance.
the
difference
that
we
are
engaged
in
is
whether
the
quality
of
performance
can
ever
constitute
that
rare
exception
that
would
justify
a
district
court
saying,
you
performed
greater
than
what
the
market
would
have
valued
you
at
before
your
performance.
that's
really
what
the
issue
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
of
the
purposes
of
congress
--
one
of
the
purposes
of
congress
was
to
ensure
that
litigants
under
these
fee-shifting
statutes
could
attract
competent
counsel,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
market
doesn't
give
them
attorneys
to
start
with
because
there
are
so
many
risks
involved
in
this
process
and
it
sets
a
reduced
fee
because
of
those
risks,
how
do
you
attract
competent
counsel?
how
do
you
attract
counsel
that
is
better
than
the
norm
in
that
field
to
pursue
as
private
attorney
generals
cases
that
congress
has
determined
are
worthy
of
being
pursued,
unless
you
have
a
quality
adjustment
factor?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
doesn't
mean
dague
was
right,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
one
is
arguing
a
different
point?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
aren't
you
--
most
of
your
arguments
are
suggesting
that
the
counter
--
that
your
adversary
is
now
limiting,
that
the
adjustment
should
be
made
--
tied
to
something,
and
that
something
would
be
the
actual
rate.
and
most
of
the
factors
you
are
talking
about
--
whether
the
person's
a
national
attorney
with
overhead
or
whether
that
person's
a
--
has
done
better
work
--
the
example
i
used,
a
second-year
associate,
could
be
adjusted
just
in
the
rate,
and
that
would
give
you
a
grounded
place
to
make
a
judgment
about
the
exercise
of
a
court's
discretion.
why
isn't
that
a
more
structured,
more--
