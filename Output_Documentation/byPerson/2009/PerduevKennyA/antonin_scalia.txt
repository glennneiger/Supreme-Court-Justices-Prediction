what
is
similar
--
what
is
similar
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
quality
of
the
representation,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
it
name
those
factors
as
--
as
the
determinative
factors,
instead
of
saying,
and
therefore
they
should
get
more
money
for
quality?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
they
advanced
--
they
advanced
money
for
experts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--during
the
case.
the
contingency,
which
we
rejected
as
a
--
as
a
basis.
and
what
was
the
third
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
weren't
paid
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
same
as
contingency?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
the
question
under
the
statute
is
whether
it
would
be
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee,
and
i
guess
one
way
to
determine
that
is
to
ask
whether
it
would
be
considered
reasonable
if
a
law
firm
that
billed
a
client
according
to
their
regular
hourly
rates
came
in
and
said,
but
we're
going
to
kick
it
up
another
--
you
know,
another
$10,000
because
this
--
this
second-year
associate,
boy,
he's
a
whiz,
and
he
performed
like
a
senior
partner.
so
we
are
going
to
--
we
are
billing
him
at
the
$500
rate,
instead
of
the
$200.
would
--
would
that
be
considered
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
indeed,
you
don't
know
that
the
brilliance
of
the
second-year
associate
enables
the
$500-an-hour
partner
to
spend
less
time
on
the
matter.
presumably
it
does.
it's
so
great
when
it
comes
to
him,
he
doesn't
have
to
do
much
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
we
can
never
exceed
the
lodestar
amount?
i
mean,
we
have
said
in
some
cases
that
in
extraordinary
circumstances
it
can.
what
are
those
extraordinary
circumstances,
or
do
you
think
there
are
none?
justice
antonin
scalia
such
as?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
you
referring
to,
if
not
attorney
performance?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
what
we
had
in
mind,
huh?
you
think
that's
what
we
had
in
mind
when
we
said
they
are
extraordinary
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
very
imaginative,
but
i
would
never--
[laughter]
--but
i
would
never
have
thought
of
it,
and
i
doubt
whether
we
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
what
is
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
[laughter]
i
mean,
if
--
if
you
get
rewarded
for
unpopularity,
you
ought
to
be
get
penalized
for
popularity.
you
got
a
lot
more
clients
because
of
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
wait.
that's
pretty
objective:
results
obtained.
i
mean,
if,
you
know,
the
--
what
was
sought
in
the
complaint
was
100,
and
in
fact
you
got
only
30,
you
are
still
a
prevailing
party,
but
you
shouldn't
--
you
shouldn't
be
compensated
as
though
you
got
everything
that
was
sought.
i
think
that's
much
more
objective
than
whether
--
whether
this
attorney
is
the
best
one
i've
seen
in
28
years.
i
have
another
problem
with
it.
i
don't
like
judges
--
it's
certainly
not
in
the
tradition
of
the
bench
to
comment
upon
the
performance
of
lawyers.
i
can't
tell
you
how
often
i
would
like
to
give
a
separate
grade
for--
[laughter]
--for
the
lawyer
who
won
a
case.
you
know,
one
grade
for
the
case
and
the
other
for
the
lawyer.
but
we
don't
do
that.
and
if
you
do
this
going
up,
you've
got
to
do
it
going
down.
and
you
could
expect
the
judge
to
say:
this
is
the
worst
performance
i
have
seen
in
28
years.
judges
don't
do
that
in
our
system,
and
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
we
should
set
up
a
mechanism
that
induces
them
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
discretion.
i
say
randomness.
i
mean,
that
is
not
a
matter
of
discretion.
it
is
a
matter
of
randomness.
how
--
how
long
has
the
judge
who
observed
this
case
been
on
the
bench?
if
he
has
been
there
just
a
couple
of
years,
kiss
good-bye
to
your
--
your
extra
money
for
being
excellent.
that's
random.
that's
not
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
want
this
court
to
look
to
those
cases
--
you
know,
it's
the
world
turned
upside
down.
instead
of
the
lower
courts
reading
our
cases,
we
have
to
read
lower
court
cases
to
decide
what
this
statute
means.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
this
statute
was
passed
before
we
adopted
the
lodestar
approach,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
this
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
i
would
think
it
cuts
the
other
way.
congress
was
not
contemplating
that
we
would
adopt
approach
--
an
approach
which
takes
into
account
the
excellence
of
counsel.
