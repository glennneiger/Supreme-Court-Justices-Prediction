mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
the
colloquy
that
involved
justices
ginsburg
and
justice
kennedy
about
the
rates
and
whether
you
can
have
sort
of
pre-enhanced
rates
as
part
of
the
lodestar
or
whether
you
can
only
do
the
enhancement
after
the
fact.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
as
long
as
it
is
established
in
this
case
that
you
can
have
an
enhancement
for
quality,
i
suppose
that
my
--
my
clients
would
be
satisfied.
the
point
is,
though,
that
the
preexisting
law
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
most
circuits
does
not
allow
for
a
pre-enhanced
rate
to
be
used
to
calculate
the
lodestar.
they
are
either
done
completely
mechanically,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggests
--
the
laffey
index
in
the
d.c.
circuit
--
or
they
are
done
through
a
simple
calculation
of
the
prevailing
market
rates.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
let
me
say
that
i
don't
think
that
you
need
any
more
standards
for
the
possibility
of
an
upward
departure
than
you
need
for
the
possibility
of
a
downward
departure.
and
this
court
has
already
held
in
farrar
v.
hobby
that
the
results
obtained
is
an
adequate
basis
for
departure,
and
not
a
small
departure.
in
farrar
v.
hobby,
the
lodestar
amount,
the
mechanical
calculation
that
we're
talking
about,
was
$280,000.
what
was
the
reasonable
attorney's
fee?
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
two
things,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
results
obtained
is
one
of
the
two
factors
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
i
think
results
obtained
can
be
objective
and
be
a
basis
for
an
upward
adjustment
as
well
as
a
downward
adjustment.
as
you
heard
the
lawyer
in
the
earlier
case
say,
you
know,
in
a
complaint,
it
is
a
wish
list.
and
it's
a
rare
case
where
the
attorney
gets
everything
they
ask
for
in
the
complaint.
this
is
that
rare
case
where
everything
that
was
asked
for
in
the
complaint
was
obtained.
so
that's
one
factor,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean,
i
defer
to
you,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
comports
with
my
experience.
i
have
seen
lawyers
come
into
this
court
and
concede
a
point
in
oral
argument,
and
i
have
seen
that
prominently
featured
in
this
court's
opinion,
so
it
does
seem
to
me
that
sometimes
the
quality
of
the
performance
and
the
results
obtained
do
depend
on
the
lawyer's
performance
and
are
not
foreordained
just
by
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint.
and
so
i
think,
again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
think
what
he
says
is,
in
the
hands
of
another
counsel,
the
relief
that
was
obtained
might
have
been
significantly
less.
this
was
an
enormous--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
maybe
not
--
no,
not
how
good.
how
tenacious.
i
mean,
this
case
settled.
with
a
different
lawyer
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
than--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
maybe
your
perspective's
changed,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
i
would
say
certainly
in
the
context
of
a
consent
decree,
when
to
give
up,
when
to
fight
further,
is
going
to
be
factored
into
the
results.
and
i
think
it's
a
fair
point
that
a
judge
in
today's
system,
especially
in
the
context
of
class
relief
like
this,
sees
a
lot
of
cases
that
end
up
with
a
coupon
settlement
that
really
doesn't
do
any
good
for
the
class.
they're--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
on
that
my
perspective
has
changed,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
let
me
say
two
things:
one
is,
less
than
10
percent
of
the
total
rates
here,
the
total
compensable
hours
here,
were
top-of-the-market
rates.
only
the
two
lead
counsel
were
compensated,
at
sort
of
$495
and
$450
an
hour.
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
--
the
lowry
declaration,
which
is
one
thing
that
mr.
shah
brought
up,
what
he
quoted
from
was
essentially
the
conclusion
of
that,
where
as
part
of
the
existing
eleventh
circuit
precedent
that
looks
to
prevailing
rates
in
the
atlanta
market,
there
is
a
recitation
that
that
is
the
sort
of
the
prevailing
rate
consistent
with
the
quality.
that's
essentially
something
that
the
eleventh
circuit
requires
you
to
say.
i
think
the
more
relevant
part
of
that
declaration
is
at
joint
appendix
at
page
35,
where
ms.
lowry
points
out
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
rates
in
the
atlanta
market
do
nothing
to
account
for
the
fact
that
she
has
to
pay
new
york
overhead,
and
that
her
real
rates
are
a
national
rate
based
on
providing
a
service
that
almost
no
one
else
in
the
country
can
provide.
this
is
really
a
unique--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
the
numbers
aren't
broken
down.
but
i
can
tell
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
what
i
think
you
can
say
for
sure,
justice
breyer,
is
that
what
came
out
of
that
is
a
lot
more
if
you
have
your
office
in
new
york--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--than
if
you
have
your
office
in
atlanta.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
do,
justice
breyer,
but
i
also
think
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
you
can
ever
have
an
enhancement.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
take
issue,
though,
with
the
hypothetical
that
all
these
lawyers
are
getting
the
top,
top
rate.
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
is
happening,
either
in
this
case
or
in
general.
and
one
of
the
things,
if
you
look
out
at
the
circuits,
you
will
see
that,
because
this
court
has
always
said
that
the
lodestar
method
is
a
two-step
process,
the
first
step,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
described
it,
is
an
estimate.
because
of
that,
the
circuits
have
some
looseness
as
to
how
they
go
about
estimating
the
reasonable
hourly
rate.
they
do
not
say:
let's
take
the
tippy-tip-top
rate
and
use
that
to
calculate
the
rate.
they
use
a
variety
of
formulas.
as
i
say,
the
laffey
index
in
the
d.c.
circuit
is
quite
formulistic
and
doesn't
--
it
puts
you
in
three-year
groups
and
doesn't
change
your
compensation
between
your
8th
and
11th
year
and
your
12th
and
20th
year,
so
it's
very
mechanical.
in
some
circuits,
you
can
get
a
national
rate.
so
in
a
circuit
--
if
this
case
would
have
been
litigated
in
cincinnati
in
the
sixth
circuit,
then
ms.
lowry
may
have
been
able
to
get
$700
an
hour,
which
is
a
national
rate.
on
the
other
hand,
because
this
was
in
atlanta,
she
was
able
to
get
the
prevailing
market
rate
in
atlanta,
which
was
495.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
no.
but
i
don't
mean
to
--
i
would
start
with
this
court's
cases
that
say
it
is
to
be
in
a
rare
case.
now,
they
say
that
repeatedly,
so
i
take
this
court
at
its
word,
and
i
would
think
that
the
rare
case
might--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
--
but
he
had
one
case
in
28
years,
so,
i
mean,
whatever
the
denominator
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
a
huge
denominator,
and
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
actually,
i
don't
think
that's
a
crazy
way
to
approach
it,
which
is
this
really
is
supposed
to
be
something
that's
reserved
for
the
rare
case.
i
am
not
--
i
don't
want
to
see--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
maybe
the
judge
stays
his
or
her
hand
in
the
first
year.
i
mean,
this
is
a
discretionary
judgment.
there
is
an
element
of
discretion
in
this,
that
starts
with
the
statutory
text
--
which
is
"may",
not
"must"
--
and
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
time
again
that
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
no,
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
discretionary
judgment.
i
mean,
the
--
the
district
courts
are
going
to
be
exercising
that
discretion
guided
by
what
this
court
has
said.
this
court
has
said
it
should
be
the
rare
case
in
which
there's
an
enhancement.
i
think
they
are
entitled
to
take
this
case
--
this
court
at
its
word,
and
i
think
there's
a
reason,
by
the
way,
as
this
court
has
rejected
enhancement
based
on
other
factors,
that
it
has
always
held
out
the
possibility
for
the
enhancement
in
the
rare
case,
for
the
quality
of
service
and
the
excellence
of
results.
the
reason
is,
if
you
take
that
off
the
table,
then
the
statute
becomes
unrecognizable
to
the
congress
that
passed
it.
this
is
not
a
difficult
question
about
whether
the
congress
that
passed
the
statute
intended
for
there
to
be
bonuses
or
enhancements
based
on
exceptional
quality
and
results.
those
of
you
that
look
to
legislative
history,
in
this
context
of
interpreting
this
statute,
have
repeatedly
looked
to
the
senate
report.
the
senate
report
provides
three
exemplary
cases
as
to
how
you
should
correctly
apply
an
attorney's
fee.
two
of
those
three
cases
applied
enhancements
based
on
exceptional
performance
and
results.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
two
--
two
responses,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
know
you
don't,
and
i
know
that
because
i
read
your
dissent
--
or
your
concurrence--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
blanchard.
the
rest
of
the
court
did
that
in
blanchard,
and
i
think
it
should
continue
to
do
that
because
you
are
interpreting
a
word
like
"reasonable",
and
i
think
have
you
to
look
somewhere,
and
the
--
and
the
senate
report
provides
guidance.
the
second
thing
though
is,
justice
scalia,
you,
in
a
number
of
contexts,
have
pointed
out
that,
if
you
don't
look
to
legislative
history,
it's
okay
to
look
at
how
a
term
was
interpreted
by
courts
at
the
time
that
congress
adopted
it.
and
that's
another
way
to
get
at
the
same
result,
which
is,
in
this
is
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
would
say
that
--
you
know,
you
can
look
to
the
fact
that
we
have
had
a
lot
of
inflation
since
then.
you
can
make
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
you
should
because,
again,
what
congress
said
it
was
trying
to
do
here
was
not
to
try
to
make
people
indifferent
between
whether
they
became
lawyers
or
not.
they
were
looking
at
lawyers
and
they
were
trying
to
determine,
we
want
to
essentially
make
you
indifferent
between
engaging
in
civil
rights
work
and
other
complex
civil
litigation,
like
antitrust,
and
if
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--before
you
adopted
the
lodestar,
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
not
before
the
lower
courts
had
adopted
the
lodestar,
and
which
way
does
that
cut?
i
think
that
cuts
very
strongly
against
adopting
a
rule
that
says,
the
lodestar
is
not
just
a
guiding
principle
but
is
an
absolute
ceiling
on
the
award.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again,
your
honor,
with
respect,
i
don't
think,
in
any
direct
way,
the
lodestar
takes
into
account
the
quality
of
counsel.
prevailing
market
rates,
as
justice
stevens
indicated,
win
or
lose
--
those
are
the
prevailing
market
rates.
so
i
don't
think
it
directly
takes
it
into
account.
and,
the
question
here
is
whether
you
can
ever
take
that
into
account.
and
i
actually
think,
if
you
are
looking
for
guidance,
you
can
look
to
the
early
third
circuit
cases
that
were
decided
before
congress
passed
the
statute,
and
what
those
third
circuit
cases
decided
--
there
was
an
en
banc
case,
lindy
ii,
by
judge
aldisert
and
a
panel
opinion
in
merola
by
judge
garth.
and
what
those
decisions
did
is
they
said
the
great
thing
about
having
a
lodestar
with
adjustments
is
that,
in
the
mine
run
of
cases,
the
rates
are
going
to
get
quality
of
performance
results
about
right.
but
what
they--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think,
right
now,
they
are
sort
of,
at
best,
staying
stagnant
and
maybe
going
down
a
little
bit.
i
think
this
court
has
always
looked
to
the
market
in
setting
rates
a
bit.
i
think
the
main
thing
the
fact
that
rates
are
not
going
up
in
sort
of
an
inevitable
cycle
suggests
to
me
is
that
this
court
has
to
recognize
that
the
one
basis
for
enhancement
that
it
has
already
consistently
recognized,
which
is
an
enhancement
for
delay,
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
contingency.
this
court
recognized
that
enhancement
for
delay
was
appropriate
in
the
case
of
missouri
v.
jenkins.
now,
this
court
indicated
that
you
can
take
account
for
delay,
either
through
current
rates,
instead
of
historical
rates,
or
through
an
enhancement.
i
think
the
one
thing
we
know
now
is
you
have
to
be
careful
about
using
current
rates
to
take
into
account
for
delay
because
the
assumption
that
that
would
work
was
based
on
this
assumption
that
rates
inevitably
go
up.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
--
and
maybe
that's
right,
and
maybe
there
should
be
adjustment
in
those
cases.
maybe
you
shouldn't
just
take
the
prevailing
rate
for
the
general
provision
of
services.
you
should
take
into
account
that,
actually,
you
have
lawyers
here
who
are
willing
to
do
it
for
free.
sometimes,
i
think
you
get
what
you
pay
for,
but
that's
a
different
subject.
[laughter]
i
do
think
that
you
can
make
adjustments,
and
that's
what
is
--
think
about
the
term
"the
lodestar".
i
mean,
the
lodestar
is
not
a
destination.
it's
not
a
complete
calculation.
the
lodestar
is
a
guiding
light.
it
gets
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
not,
but
if
we
want
to
resort
to
what
congress
had
in
mind,
i
think
that
only
favors
the
idea
that
you
would
have
adjustments
upward
and
downward.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
the
term
is
"reasonable",
and,
again,
i
think,
if
you
were
looking
for
fertile
ground
to
derive
a
bright-line
rule
that
you
never,
ever
have
an
enhancement
for
quality--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
guess
what
i
would
say,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
that
potentially
could
be
more
structured.
i'm
not
sure
it
inherently
is,
which
is
to
say
i
think
--
you
know,
in
some
ways,
it
may
be
more
transparent
to
say,
we
are
just
going
to
use
the
laffey
index,
or
we
are
going
to
use
the
prevailing
market
rates,
and
then
we
are
really
going
to
hone
in
on
the
issue
of
quality
and
exceptional
results
after
the
fact.
i
think,
if
the
court
wants
to
suggest
that
you
should
take
those
factors
into
account
in
setting
the
rate
--
and
the
rate
should
not
be
just
a
rigidly
calculated
rate
that
comes
from
an
index
or
comes
from
the
prevailing
market
--
i
think
the
one
thing
i
would
very
much
want
to
urge
on
you
is,
if
you
take
that
route,
that
you
allow
a
remand
for
an
opportunity
for
my
clients
to
make
that
showing
to
the
district
court
because
there's
no
question,
from
the
record
here,
that
they
were
responding
to
extant
law
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
and
that
extant
law
did
not
provide
that
possibility
for
adjustment
with
the
prevailing
market
rates.
those
were--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
first
let
me
say
that
i
had
understood,
and
perhaps
this
was
wishful
thinking,
but
i
had
understood
that
justice
sotomayor
was
suggesting
the
possibility
of
a
broader
inquiry
at
the
rate-setting
stage,
not
just
a
narrow
focus
sort
of
within
bands.
so
i
just
--
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
respond
to.
as
to
trying
to
cabin
the
discretion,
let
me
try
to
offer
some
thoughts
about
cabining
the
discretion,
but
let
me
also
say
that,
to
paraphrase
justice
scalia,
what
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
i
mean,
this
court
has
said
that
there
are
bases
for
downward
departures,
and
including
downward
departures
all
the
way
to
zero
in
farrar
v.
hobby,
and
the
court
has
not
been
overly
concerned
about
cabining
that
discretion.
and
that
kind
of
discretion
goes
on
downward
all
the
time.
it
can
take
place
in
the
terms
of
looking
at
a
particular
motion
and
saying
that
wasn't
a
very
good
motion;
you
were
wasting
your
time.
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
that
that
can
be
taken
into
account
downward,
and
this
court
hasn't
felt
that
concerned
about
cabining
the
discretion.
now,
if
this
court
wants
to
cabin
the
discretion,
i
think
certainly
there's
two
factors
here:
there's
the
quality
of
service
and
there
is
the
exceptional
results.
as
to
the
quality
of
service,
i
would
certainly
say
that
you
ought
not
to
have
a
rigid
rule,
which
is
essentially
what
petitioners
are
asking
for,
that
would
cap
you
with
prevailing
market
rates.
there
ought
to
be
some
flexibility
for
that,
for
the
judge
to
take
into
account
the
actual
experience
that
the
judge
has
with
the
lawyers
in
the
courtroom.
the
second
thing
i
would
say
is
that
i
do
think
it
ought
to
be
fair,
if
you
are
going
to
do
this
kind
of
calculation,
that
you
don't
base
it
on
something
like
the
laffey
index,
and
you
don't
base
it
on
a
rule
that
a
national
expert
can
never
get
a
national
prevailing
rate,
but
even
though
they
are
sitting
in
new
york,
they
have
to
get
the
top
rate
only
in
the
atlanta
market.
i
think
those
differences
should
be
taken
into
account
on
the
compensation
side
of
things.
and
then
if
at
some
point,
the
judge
wants
to
say,
and
i
want
to
give
either
this
rate
or
this
multiplier
for
the
quality
of
the
performance,
then
that's
something
that
you
can
certainly
assess.
as
to
the
exceptional
results,
i
also
think
there,
too,
you
can
focus
on
specific
factors
of
the
case
before
you,
and
you
can
say
things.
now,
i
would
say,
for
example
in
this
case,
part
of
the
reason
the
results
are
exceptional
--
i
would
point
to
at
least
three
things:
one
is
the
advance
of
capital
here
in
order
to
take
on
a
case
of
this
breadth
and
undertaking
is
really
an
exceptional
undertaking.
and
if
you
look
at
the
goldberg
declaration
at
joint
appendix
75,
that
declaration
points
out
that
a
smaller
firm
would
have
essentially
been
bankrupted
by
this
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
district
judge
cut
--
cut
out
all
of
them
following
this
court's
decision
in
casey,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
was
still,
though,
i
should
say,
something
on
the
order
of
$750,000
in
reimbursable
expenses
that
had
to
be
advanced.
it's
worth
pointing
out
that
one
factor
that
judge
shoob
took
into
account
in
giving
an
enhancement
here
was
the
delay
in
payment.
that
is
a
permissible
factor
under
missouri
v.
jenkins,
and
even
if
you
use
current
rates,
that
doesn't
do
anything
to
compensate
you
for
the
delay
in
reimbursement
of
expenses.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
i
was
just
making
a
narrow
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
the
current
rates
don't
take
into
account
the
fact
that
there
was
a
delay
in
repayment
for
reimbursable
expenses.
some
of
these
expenses
were
paid
out
4
years
ago,
i
mean
at
the
time
of
the
fee
calculation.
you
don't
get
sort
of,
you
know,
today's
copying
expenses
or
today's
fedex
expenses.
you
get
the
expenses
at
the
time
you
did
them,
and
you
don't
get
any
prejudgment
interest
on
that.
so
that
is
one
thing
judge
shoob
thought
ought
to
be
compensated
here.
again,
that's
one
factor
that
makes
this
exceptional.
another
factor
is
that
this
was
an
entrenched
problem
that
they
were
dealing
with.
in
1989
the
foster
care
child
system
in
georgia
was
described
as
a
crisis;
by
1996
it
had
been
upgraded
to
a
catastrophe.
this
is
a
very
difficult
problem.
the
last
thing
is
the
scope
of
the
relief,
which
really
is,
i
think,
very
broad
here
and
that's
what
judge
shoob
was
recognizing.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
i
do
think
in
an
era
of
coupon
settlements,
a
judge
is
entitled
to
look
at
a
case
like
this
and
say
this
is
really
a
remarkable
result
that
has
been
achieved
here,
and
the
normal
rates
--
normal
prevailing
market
rates
don't
compensate
for
this
kind
of
result.
so
i
do
think
there
are
things
that
the
court
could
point
to
in
this
case
or
in
other
cases
to
try
to
cabin
that
discretion.
i
do
think,
though,
that
discretion
is
an
inherent
feature
of
this
statutory
regime,
and
this
court
has
tolerated
a
degree
of
discretion
in
a
variety
of
contexts
including
with
respect
in
the
area
of
downward
departures.
i
do
want
to
get,
before
i
sit
down,
this
point
about
getting
the
incentives
right,
because
one
thing
that
congress
was
clearly
very
concerned
about
was
getting
the
incentive
rights
for
counsel.
and
if
you
accept
petitioner's
position
that
the
lodestar
is
a
ceiling
and
not
something
that
is
subject
to
adjustment
up
or
down,
then
what
you
are
telling
lawyers
is
the
that
the
maximum
amount
they
can
make
in
a
civil
rights
case
is
the
minimum
amount
they
can
make
in
a
different
case,
where
by
the
way
they
will
get
paid
every
30
days
and
their
expenses
will
get
reimbursed
in
real
time.
then
you
are
also
telling
them
something
else,
which
is,
that's
actually
just
a
starter
because
there
are
multiple
ways
for
district
courts
to
cut
down
on
the
lodestar
amount,
either
because
you
spent
too
much
time
on
this
or
we
didn't
like
your
travel
expenditures.
and
so
there
are
multiple
ways
for
those
hours
to
be
cut
down.
if
you
accept
petitioner's
rule
and
there
is
no
way
to
get
those
rates
bumped
up
in
any
circumstances,
then
you
are
basically
guaranteeing
that,
as
i
say,
the
maximum
you
can
make
in
a
civil
rights
is
the
minimum
you
can
make
in
any
other
kind
of
cases.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
two
things,
mr.
chief--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--two
things,
mr.
chief
justice:
one,
it's
the
law
of
the
eleventh
circuit
and
i
think
every
circuit
that
before
submitting
your
fees
to
the
court
you
are
supposed
to
use
billing
judgment
and
take
care
of
some
of
those
things,
approximating
maybe
what
your
client
would
do
for
you.
but,
second,
and
i
think
more
tellingly,
the
client
may
do
that
to
you.
the
client
doesn't
have
the
help
of
your
opposing
counsel
to
egg
them
on
and
give
them
suggestions,
and
that's
what
a
district
court
does
in
the
context
of
one
of
these
cases.
so
i
really
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
you
are
systematically
undercompensating
counsel.
and
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
take
into
account
practicalities,
i
am
not
here
to
reargue
the
dague
case,
but
if
you
want
to
talk
about
practicalities,
the
fact
that
all
of
these
cases
are
contingency
cases
and
the
rational
market
for
those
would
be
much
higher
than
--
if
you
are
worried
about
sort
of
windfalls
for
plaintiff
counsel
in
these
kind
of
cases,
you
really
can
worry
about
something
else,
with
all
due
respect,
because
the
combined
effect
of
dague
and
casey
makes
it
very
difficult
to
get
sort
of
comparable
compensation.
as
i
say,
i
am
not
here
to
reargue
those
cases.
i
do
think,
frankly,
dague
is
distinguishable
because
there
you
had
the
prevailing
party
language.
the
other
thing
about
dague
that's
distinguishable
that
i
will
say
before
i
sit
down
is
one
of
this
court's
concerns
in
dague
was
creating
an
asymmetry.
blanchard
had
already
said
that
contingency
fees
could
not
cap
your
awards;
they
didn't
want
to
have
an
asymmetrical
system.
that's
exactly
what
petitioners
are
asking
you
for,
is
a
completely
asymmetrical
system.
farrar
v.
hobby
says
you
can
reduce
downwards
based
on
exceptionally
poor
results.
there
would
be
no
basis
whatsoever
to
even
adjust
a
little
bit
under
their
rule
for
exceptional
results
on
the
upside.
thank
you.
