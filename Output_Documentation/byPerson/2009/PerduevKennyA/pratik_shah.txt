mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1988
permits
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
that
means
going
above
and
beyond
the
lodestar
amount
can
be
justified
only
if
the
lodestar
is
unreasonably
low.
we
submit
that
a
lodestar
based
on
prevailing
market
rates
does
not
require
a
performance
bonus
on
top
of
the
lodestar
to
make
an
award
reasonable.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
there
are
none
for
attorney
performance,
your
honor.
there
may
be
other
circumstances--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
the
government
sets
out
one
example
in
our
brief
of
where
we
think
an
upward
enhancement
might
be
appropriate,
and
that's
where
an
attorney
takes
on
a
particularly
unpopular
client
or
cause
that
causes
some
external
harm,
external
to
the
case,
to
his
practice
or
income,
where--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
circumstance
is
much
more
closely
tied
to
the
statutory
purpose
of
section
1988,
which
is
to
attract
competent
counsel
in
this
subset
of--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
what
our
--
what
our
enhancement
would
allow
for,
even
if
you
can't
make
the
ex
ante
determination
that
taking
on
this
representation
is
going
to
cause
me
some
special
harm;
that
is,
all
my
clients
will
leave
my
firm
if
i
take
on
this
case
--
even
if
you
don't
know
that
before
the
fact,
the
fact
that
there
is
an
ability
for
the
court
to
give
you
an
enhancement
when
that
occurs
--
remember,
this
is
done
after
--
after
the
case
is
already
complete
is
when
the
--
fee
hearing
determination
is
made.
the
ability
of
a
court
to
give
that
sort
of
compensation
would
provide
an
insurance,
a
guarantee
to
the
attorney
before
they
take
on
a
case
that
if
it
turns
out
badly
that
--
that
they
will
still
get
compensated.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well
--
well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
it
is
--
your
honor,
it
is
one
of
the
10
--
one
of
the
johnson
factors
set
forth,
so
it's
not
coming
out
of
thin
air.
and
i
think
it
is--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
that
is
the
only
one
that
i
think
is
left
after
this
court's
fee-setting
jurisprudence
over
the
last
25
years.
it
has
consistently
knocked
down
other
bases
for
an
enhancement
such
as
complexity
of
issues,
novelty
of
issues,
contingency
risk,
delayed
payment.
all
of
those
other
grounds
of
potential
enhancement
that
the
legislative
history
refers
to
have
been
categorically
prohibited
by
this
court's
jurisprudence.
i
think
that--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
i
think
the
limited
circumstances
which
allow
for
a
downward
adjustment
would
be
those
set
forth
in
this
court's
decision
in
hensley.
i
don't
think
that
poor
performance
alone
would
justify
a
downward
departure--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
so
if
there
were
certain
claims
that
the
poor
performance
led
--
led
the
plaintiff
to
be
unsuccessful
on
certain
claims
but
not
all
the
claims,
i
think
a
downward
departure
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
a
downward
departure
would
be
appropriate
in
that
circumstance,
because
that's
what
the
--
the
prevailing
market
would
not
allow
for
a
downward
departure.
normally,
these
are
standard--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well
--
well,
your
honor,
that
would
be
taken
care
of
in
the
setting
of
the
lodestar
rate.
remember,
there
are
two
components--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
it
--
not
in
the
lodestar
rate,
but
in
the
number
of
reasonable
--
there
are
two
components
to
the
lodestar
calculation:
the
number
of
--
number
of
hours
reasonably
spent
on
the
matter
and
the
reasonable
hourly
rate.
the
situation
you
posit
would
be
addressed
by
a
downward
adjustment
of
the
number
of
hours
reasonably
spent
working
on
the
case.
if
the
judge
made
a
determination
that
any
competent
lawyer
could
have
done
this
in
10
hours,
he
would
not
credit
50
hours
of
work.
and
that's
--
that's
how
that
situation
would
be
taken
care
of.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
no,
your
honor,
that
would
not
require
a
reduction.
that
would
be
an
extra
award
for
the
attorney
taking
on
that
type
of
--
of
case.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
in
the
--
in
the
private
market
for
that
sort
of
downward
adjustment.
justice
sotomayor,
if
i
can
address
your
concern
about
these
alternative
arrangements
that
--
that
occur
in
--
that
are
starting
to
emerge
--
at
least
respondents
suggest
in
their
brief
to
this
court
by
citing
a
few
newspaper
articles
and
the
proverbial
word
on
the
street
that
these
are
an
emerging
trend.
first
of
all,
there's
no
--
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
those
type
of
arrangements
were
available
in
the
relevant
market.
but
even
if
they
were,
those
sort
of
alternative
arrangements
are
essentially
modified
contingency
arrangements.
and
this
is
made
most
clear
in
respondents'
own
amicus
brief,
the
brief
of
the
law
and
economic
scholars.
and
this
is
at
page
10
and
11
of
their
brief.
they
call
these
partial
contingency
or
hybrid
contingency
arrangements.
it's
not
the
same
standard
hourly
rate
and
then
a
client
decides
to
throw
in
a
kicker
of
a
million
dollar
bonus.
rather,
these
are
discounted
rates
with
a
success
bonus,
essentially
a
modified
form
of
contingency
arrangement.
they
are
prohibited
for
exactly
the
same
reason
that
this
court
prohibited
a
contingency
risk
enhancement
in
dague.
the
same
reasons
would
prohibit
relying
on
those
sort
of
alternative
arrangements
to
provide
an
attorney
enhancement
for
performance.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
two
responses,
your
honor:
first,
the
problem
that
you
posit
about
attorneys
having
--
being
deterred
by
having
to
absorb,
you
know,
the
--
the
upfront
outlay
of
significant
expert
expenses
or
to
having
absorbed
the
contingency
risks,
those
are
problems
created
by
this
court's
precedent
in
dague,
not
before
this
court
now.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
no
one
has
asked--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no
one
in
this
case
has
asked
the
court
to
revisit
dague.
but
more
--
more
to
the
point
of
your
question,
the
type
--
even
accepting
respondents'
formulation
of
this
enhancement,
it
would
only
be
available
in
the
rare
and
exceptional
case.
and
no
reasonable
attorney
making
an
ex
ante
determination
to
whether
to
take
on
a
representation
would
rely
on
the
speculative
and
remote
possibility
that
the
district
judge
is
going
to
have
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
best
cases
he
has
ever
seen
in
making
that
calculation.
respondents'
own
numbers
suggest
that
these
are
granted
less
than
one
time
--
once
a
year.
that
suggests
that
no
reasonable
attorney
would
take
that
into
consideration,
and
it
does
not,
in
fact,
further
the
statutory
purpose
in
that
event
of
attracting
competent
counsel.
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point,
and
this
is
to
bring
us
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
think
respondents'
own
trial
counsel
--
the
discussion
that
they
give
of
the
lodestar
rates
used
in
this
case
i
think
is
particularly
telling.
and
this
is
the
affidavit
of
marcia
lowry,
who
was
the
lead
plaintiff's
trial
counsel,
and
this
was
submitted
during
the
fee
--
setting
hearing,
and
the
relevant
excerpt
appears
on
page
41
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
i
want
to
read
from
paragraph
25,
and
here's
what
she
has
to
say
about
the
rates
used
by
the
court:
"the
standard
hourly
rates
reflected
in
exhibit
2.
"
--and
those
are
the
rates
used
by
the
district
court
--
"are
fair,
reasonable
and
consistent
with
the
hourly
rates
in
the
atlanta
market
for
the
price
of
legal
services
of
comparable
quality
rendered
in
cases
demanding
similar
skill,
judgment,
and
performance.
"
now,
the
affidavit
goes
on
to
say
that
the
rates
are
still
too
low
for
the
other
factors
that
mr.
cohen
discussed
--
contingency
risk,
delayed
payment,
expert
fees
--
but
not
for
attorney
performance.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
thank
you,
your
honor.
