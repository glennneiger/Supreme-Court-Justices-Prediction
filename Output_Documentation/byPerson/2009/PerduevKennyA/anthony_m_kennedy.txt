it
is
not
clear
to
me
what
the
district
judge
should
do
in
making
the
lodestar
calculation
when
he
considers
quality
of
performance.
i
guess
you
are
saying
--
i
think
maybe
you
have
already
said
--
that
he
can
consider
quality
of
performance,
but
only
within
the
confines
of
what
is
a
reasonable
rate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
brief
for
the
respondent
said:
well,
you
know,
you
are
really
counting
this
at
the
front
end,
and
if
you
can
do
that,
why
not
put
it
in
at
the
back
end?
and
i'm
just
having
problems
with
that
still.
suppose
the
judge
at
the
outset
said:
this
quality
of
performance
is
so
good
that,
so
far
as
the
lodestar
is
concerned,
i
think
a
reasonable
fee
is
above
the
usual
hourly
rate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
so
that
in
computing
the
lodestar
rate,
he
cannot
consider
quality
of
performance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
that
he
does
not
look
to
actual
quality
of
performance.
he
just
looks
to
market
rates
without
reference
to
that.
i
--
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
why
i'm
having
--
i'm
--
i
mean,
you
know,
the
--
the
question
presented
is
--
is
just
quality
of
performance
and
results
obtained;
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
see
why
that
can't
be
considered
as
part
of
the
lodestar,
and
if
it
can
be,
then
i
don't
see
what
the
argument
is
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
extraordinary
circumstances,
what
about
a
very,
very
popular
cause
and
he
wins
and
they
are
beating
his
door
down?
can
we
reduce
it
for
that?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
--
were
expert
witness
fees
reimbursable
in
this
case,
under
--
under
the
statute?
i
noticed
they
were
cut
down,
but
i
didn't
know
if
he
cut
out
all
of
them
or
just
part
of
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
