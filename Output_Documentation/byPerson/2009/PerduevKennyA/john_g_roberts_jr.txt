chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-970,
perdue
v.
kenny
a.
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
this
--
this
brilliant
second-year
associate
we
are
talking
about,
the
way
these
submissions
to
the
court
are
--
the
way
they're
presented,
do
they
carve
out
her
contribution
to
a
particular
filing?
to
the
extent
i
have
looked
at
them
they
have
something
like,
you
know,
draft
motion
to
dismiss,
and
the
associate
has
40
hours
and
the
junior
partner
has
10
hours
and
the
senior
partner
has
5
hours
dedicated
to
that.
i
mean,
if
the
associate
is
doing
--
in
the
hypothetical,
is
doing
work
at
the
partner
level,
how
do
you
know
that
the
brilliance
isn't
contributed
by
the
4
hours
of
the
partner
rather
than
the
40
hours
of
the
associate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
one
of
the
long-standing
traditions
of
the
bar
that
lawyers
are
expected
to
do
that
in
the
normal
course.
so
why
would
that
be
a
special
circumstance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
tell
--
how
do
you
tell
whether
a
client
is
popular
or
unpopular?
i
mean,
a
lot
of
unpopular
clients
in
the
abstract
sense
are
in
fact
--
they
have
a
lot
of
support
in
the
community.
i
suppose
one
of
the
more
unpopular
clients
these
days
is
a
wall
street
banker.
[laughter]
but
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
say
--
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
law
firms
charge
more
when
they
represent
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
will
let
you
answer
your
second
point,
but
just
on
that,
i
don't
understand
the
concept
of
extraordinary
success
or
results
obtained.
the
results
that
are
obtained
are
presumably
the
results
that
are
dictated
or
command
or
required
under
the
law.
and
it's
not
like,
well,
you
had
a
really
good
attorney,
so
i'm
going
to
say
the
law
means
this,
which
gives
you
a
lot
more,
but
if
you
had
a
bad
attorney
i
would
say
the
law
has
this
and
so
he
doesn't
get
a
multiplier.
the
results
obtained
under
our
theory
should
be
what
the
law
requires,
and
not
different
results
because
you
have
different
lawyers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
what
does
a
judge
say
when
he
said,
you
have
achieved
extraordinary
results?
that
if
you
weren't
there,
i
would
have
made
a
mistake
on
the
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
that's
saying
the
same
thing
i
said,
which
if
it
weren't
for
how
good
you
are,
i
would
have
made
a
mistake.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
we
have
a
different
perspective.
you
think
the
lawyers
are
responsible
for
a
good
result,
and
i
think
the
judges
are.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
this
lawyer
--
i'm
sorry,
this
judge
said
they
were
extraordinarily
good,
but,
i
mean,
where's
the
cutoff?
if
the
judge
said,
this
is
in
the
top
10
lawyers
i've
ever
seen,
or
the
top
20,
where
do
you
get
an
enhancement
and
where
do
you
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
that's
the
thing.
it's
hard
to
tell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
for
28
years
--
the
judge
was
on
the
bench
28
years,
right?
well,
if
you
are
in
the
top
28,
is
that
a
rare
case
or
not?
it's
once
a
year.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
we
are
trying--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
are
trying
to
establish
a
principle,
and
other
judges
are
going
to
have
to
follow
this.
and
do
they
think,
well,
this
was
really
good,
but
it
wasn't
as
good
as
that
law
firm
or
lawyers
we
had
3
years
ago;
they
were
really
good.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
assume
--
how
long
--
how
does
a
judge,
who
is
on
the
bench
in
his
or
her
first
year,
do
this?
well,
this
is
the
best
lawyer
i've
had
in
the
eight
months
i
have
been
here.
[laughter]
but
how
does
he
or
she
know
that
that
--
that
may
be
as
good
as
it
gets,
for
the
next
28
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
a
flip
side
to
the
unpopular
case
situation
the
s.g.
talked
about,
which
is
lawyers
and
law
firms
sometimes
take
on
a
particular
high-profile
case
to
increase
their
profile,
and
they
would
have
done
it
for
a
lot
less.
we
have
lawyers
who
argue
here,
who
are
doing
it
for
free,
because
it's
a
big
deal
to
be
recognized
as
doing
something
in
the
supreme
court.
so
when
you
use
prevailing
rates
with
respect
to
that
type
of
work,
you
are
overcompensating
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
also
not
the
term
congress
used.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
want
to
resort
to
what
congress
said,
which
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
rates
are
set
with
--
based
on
a
law
firm's
record
of
--
i
mean,
just
because
you
bill
a
client
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
going
to
pay
or
that
they
are
going
to
pay
at
what
you
billed
them.
and
i
think
the
rates
are
set
to
take
into
account
that
over
the
past
year
whatever
you
have
a
realization
rate
of
--
whatever,
80
percent
or
85
percent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
--
general
counsel
do
that
all
the
time
when
they
get
a
bill
from
a
law
firm.
they
cut
it
down.
they
say
you
spent
--
you've
spent
too
much
time
with
this
associate
only
because
he
or
she
is
a
first-year
associate
and
is
learning
and
training;
i'm
not
going
to
pay
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
the
same
--
it's
the
same
thing
that
happens
when
a
district
court
looks
at
the
--
the
lodestar
and
cuts
it
down.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
clement.
mr.
cohen,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
justice
alito
has
her
opinion
this
morning
case
08-970
perdue
versus
kenny
a.
