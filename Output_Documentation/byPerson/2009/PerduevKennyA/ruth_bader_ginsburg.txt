justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cohen,
i
thought
this
judge,
judge
shoob,
said:
these
lawyers
were
amazingly
good;
i
have
never
seen
a
better
performance.
so
don't
we
take
him
at
his
word?
i
mean,
he
certainly
talked
about
the
quality
of
the
performance
of
these
lawyers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cohen,
you
said
in
your
brief
that,
in
such
a
case,
the
prevailing
party
could
argue
that
counsel
should
obtain
a
higher
hourly
rate
in
the
litigation
than
the
customary
rate
he
or
she
charges
in
other
cases,
and
that's
the
situation
justice
sotomayor
inquired
about.
but
that
sounds
to
me
--
you
take
the
second-year
associate,
pay
him
at
the
rate
of
the
top
partner
because
her
performance
was
so
outstanding.
that's
an
enhancement,
but
it
isn't
as
transparent
as
the
one
that
judge
shoob
gave.
but
you
--
this
suggestion
--
maybe
you
are
going
to
retreat
from
it
--
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
take
the
second-year
associate
and
pay
at
a
higher
hourly
rate
than
the
customary
rate
for
that
associate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
necessarily--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
we
are
going
back
to
the
judge,
who
did
say
that
this
was
the
best
performance
he
ever
saw.
so
i
can't
credit
just
that
it
was
just
contingency.
but,
first,
you
have
clarified
that
what
you
said
in
your
brief
meant
only
the
top
range
for
a
lawyer
of
this,
period.
so
this
is
more
limited
than
--
than
one
might
take
it
to
be.
in
some
circuits,
like
the
d.c.
circuit,
the
rate
is
set
by
the
number
of
years
that
the
person
is
out
of
law
school,
and
there
isn't
any
flexibility.
i
mean,
you
give
the
1-year
associate
so
much,
the
5-year
associate
so
much.
so
how
in
a
system
like
that
could
you
take
into
account
quality
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
--
is
there
another
example?
i
mean,
you
--
you
are
saying
the
rule
isn't
never;
it
is
sometimes.
and
you
have
given
us
one
sometime.
is
there
any
other
illustration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
a
downward
adjustment?
you
have
the
hourly
rate,
the
number
of
hours,
and
the
judge,
after
trimming
the
hours,
then
says:
this
has
been
a
case,
even
though
they
prevailed,
the
lawyer
wasn't
prepared;
i
am
not
going
to
give
the
hourly
rate.
can
a
judge
adjust
the
lodestar
down
for
poor
performance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
hensley
is
you
lost
on
an
issue,
so
you
don't
get
paid
for
what
you've
done.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
plaintiff
--
the
plaintiff
prevailed
on
everything.
it's
just
that
the
judge
said
this
was
a
really
poor
--
poor
performance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
cohen
said
that
that
would
be
a
very
limited
adjustment.
he
wasn't
contemplating
in
his
suggestion
in
his
brief
that
you
could
go
outside
what
the
associate
would
get;
you
just
go
to
the
top.
let's
say
it
could
be
200
to
400,
you
give
him
400,
but
you
don't
give
him
500.
justice
alito
asked
--
he
was
concerned
about
standard
list
enhancements,
so
one
question
is
when
do
you
enhance?
another
is,
in
this
case
it
was
75
percent.
how
do
you
know
what's
the
right
multiplier?
that
--
the
concern
is
you
are
going
to
have
variations
from
district
judge
to
district
judge
in
how
good
the
performance
was,
in
what
is
the
appropriate
multiplier.
are
there
any
handles
that
would
prevent
this
from
becoming
just
random,
just
rudderless?
