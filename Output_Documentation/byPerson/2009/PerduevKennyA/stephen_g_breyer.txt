is
the
overhead?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
overhead?
i
mean,
that's
something
that
i
find
interesting
and
important,
and
i
can't
find
it
anywhere.
the
numbers
began
to
bother
me
in
the
same
way
they
did
with
justice
alito.
i'm
thinking:
there
are
30,000
hours.
they
got
10.5
million.
that
translates
into,
what
is
it,
$350
an
hour.
now,
if
the
lawyer
works
for
2,000
hours
of
the
year,
which
is
a
little
high,
he
is
being
compensated
at
$700,000
on
average
in
this
case.
but
he
has
to
pay
overhead.
so
what's
that?
40
percent?
30?
20?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
if
you
have
any
rough
idea
at
all,
because
i
think
if
it's
anywhere
near
$700,000
on
average,
you
say
to
a
taxpayer:
you
are
going
to
pay
this,
and
that's
more
money
than
99
percent
of
the
taxpayers
hope
to
see
in
their
lives,
and
suddenly
they
are
paying
that
money
to
somebody,
which
is
--
i
could
say:
okay,
pay
them
400,000.
that's
what
he
would
get
as
the
average
fee
for
the
toppest,
most
top
lawyer.
and
that's,
you
know,
pretty
high.
and
--
but
$700,000
a
year
for
a
lawyer.
wow.
and
that's
what
this
judge
paid.
now,
what
is
it
that
came
out
of
that?
that's
what
i
want
to
know
before
i
make
up
my
mind,
frankly.
and
i'm
going
to
try
to
look
it
up,
but
i'm
trying
--
i'm
trying
to
get
a
rough
idea
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
know,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
doesn't
help
me,
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
help
me
is
because
if
it's
a
very,
very
high
number
in
dollars
per
year,
then
i
am
tempted
to
think:
well,
very
high
is
enough.
you
don't
need
very,
very,
very
high.
you
see
my
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
i
would
be
saying:
be
satisfied
forever
with
very,
very
high,
the
most
top
pay
that
any
top
lawyer
gets;
do
not
want
even
more
than
that.
and
if
in
fact
i
doubt
that
i
have
really
made
a
difference
to
incentives
on
that
one,
for
the
reason
that
the
solicitor
general
said
--
and
my
goodness,
how
do
we
explain
this
to
the
average
person?
that
--
those
are
the
questions
that
are
genuinely
going
through
my
mind.
i
haven't
made
up
my
mind
how
i
will
come
out
in
this
case.
so
it's
not
a
kind
of
putting
this
to
you.
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
i
--
should
i
look
at
the
fact
that,
in
the
early
1970s,
when
this
was
done,
legal
fees
were
not
quite
so
high?
and
perhaps,
comparatively
so,
they
weren't
quite
so
high,
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
just
inflation.
i
think
the
discrepancy
between
these
top
legal
fees
and
the
fee
of
the
average
person
--
or
the
work
of
the
average
person,
the
average
wage
for
a
family
of
four
has
changed
quite
a
lot.
i
suspect
that's
true,
but
i
could
look
it
up.
but
should
i
look
it
up?
