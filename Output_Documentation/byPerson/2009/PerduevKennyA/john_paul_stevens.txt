but
does
that
--
does
that
mean
that
the
fee
would
be
the
same
under
the
lodestar
whether
the
lawyer
won
or
lost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
for
some
reason,
if
--
if
you
did
had
some
reason
to
calculate
it,
theoretically
it
would
be
the
same
fee
as
if
he
had
lost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
the
quality
of
performance
really
is
totally
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
judge
found
as
a
fact
that
this
lawyer
spent
50
hours
doing
what
any
good
lawyer
could
do
in
5
hours?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
that
is
set
forth
in
the
lodestar
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
one
final
question:
we
have
a
question
of
law
before
us,
whether
there's
an
absolute
ceiling
here.
am
i
justified
in
assuming
that
if
we
could
reach
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
enhancement,
there's
no
argument
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
assuming
for
purposes
of
decision
that
the
enhancement
was
reasonable,
if
that
was
--
if
it's
ever
available,
because
you
are
not
challenging
the
amount.
in
other
words,
you
are
making
an
argument
of
law.
even
if
they
give
them
a
$10
enhancement,
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
issue
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
it,
the
question
of
law
presented
is
that
even
if
the
enhancement
had
only
been
$1,000--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
would
say
that
was
equally
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
