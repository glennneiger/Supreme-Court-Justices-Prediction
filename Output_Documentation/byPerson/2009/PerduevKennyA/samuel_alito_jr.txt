justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
sometimes
there's
a
great
advantage
in
doing
things
mechanically,
because
it
--
it
provides
an
element
of
fairness.
and
i'll
tell
you
what
troubles
me
about
this,
and
maybe
you
can
convince
me
that
i
shouldn't
be
troubled
by
it.
here
the
district
judge
in
effect
takes
four
plus
million
dollars
from
the
taxpayers
of
georgia
and
--
and
awards
it
above
the
lodestar
calculation
to
these
attorneys
and
says
--
and
i
--
i
certainly
take
him
at
his
word
--
this
was
the
best
performance
i
have
seen
in
28
years.
but
it
seems
totally
standardless,
and
i
see
no
way
of
policing
it,
and
i
see
a
great
danger
that
trial
judges
are
going
to
use
this
as
a
way
of
favoring
their
favorite
nonprofit
foundation
or
their
favorite
cause
or
their
favorite
attorneys,
because
they
think
they
generally
do
good
work.
and
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
like
private
litigation
where
the
money
is
coming
out
of
the
pocket
of
a
corporation.
it's
coming
out
of
the
pocket
of
taxpayers.
so
that
is
very
troubling.
and
i
don't
know
how
you
can
provide
standards
for
determining
whether
this
kind
of
transfer
is
based
on
anything
reasonable.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
--
maybe
your
perspective
has
changed
too,
mr.
clement.
[laughter]
but
your
argument
is
that,
you
know,
for
$495
an
hour
you
really
can't
get
a
good
lawyer?
you
need
to
have
--
you
need
to
pay
more
than
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you,
yourself,
make
the
point
in
your
brief
that
the
--
that
legal
fees
are
changing.
and
do
you
think
that's
relevant?
are
they
going
up?
or
are
they
going
down
now?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit
42
u.s.c
section
1988
authorizes
courts
to
award
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees
for
prevailing
parties
in
civil
rights
actions.
in
awarding
fees
in
this
action
in
this
record
calculated
the
so-called
load-star
amount,
the
hours
worked
multiplied
by
a
reasonable
hourly
fee
and
enhanced
that
amount
by
an
additional
75%
for
superior
performance
and
results
obtained.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
the
load-star
amount
may
be
increased
due
to
superior
performance
but
only
in
unusual
circumstances
under
which
the
load-star
does
not
adequately
account
for
performance.
in
addition
any
enhancement
must
be
based
on
a
reviewable
methodology
and
must
be
supported
by
specific
evidence
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
these
standards
in
this
case
we
reverse
and
remand
for
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
kennedy
and
justice
thomas
have
filed
concurring
opinions,
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
stevens
ginsburg
and
