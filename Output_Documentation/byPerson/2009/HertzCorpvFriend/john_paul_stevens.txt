mr.
schneider,
can
i
just
inject
this
thought?
it
goes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
i
don't
think
we
are
just
concerned
about
the
defendants
gaming
the
system.
i
think
one
other
very
important
concern
is
plaintiffs
sometimes
in
small
communities
want
to
sue
somebody,
and
sometimes
they
would
much
rather
be
in
federal
court,
because
sometimes
the
judges
are
better
than
the
local
judges,
and
so
forth.
so
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
plaintiffs
want
to
get
into
federal
courts.
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
important
to
have
a
rule
that
makes
it
easy
for
the
plaintiff
to
decide
what
is
the
citizenship
of
the
defendant,
can
i
get
into
federal
court
or
not.
and
i
see
it
as
a
great
argument
in
favor
of
a
very
simple
rule
to
benefit
plaintiffs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
must
acknowledge
that
it's
a
lot
easier
for
a
plaintiff
--
there
is
some
place
to
get
on
the
internet
and
say
where
is
their
principal
place
and
they
get
a
simple
answer.
if
you
get
a
question,
well,
i
got
to
analyze
their
business
all
over
the
country
to
decide,
that's
a
formidable
obstacle
for
a
--
for
a
plaintiff
to
overcome.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
an
interstate
business
who
are
commonly
defendants
in
a
lot
of
lawsuits
--
in
a
personal
injury
suit,
and
the
question
is,
can
i
easily
decide
what
the
place
of
incorporation
of
that
defendant
is.
