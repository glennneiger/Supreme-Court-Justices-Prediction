stephen
g.
breyer
the
constitution
provides
that
federal
courts
may
hear
controversies
between
citizens
of
different
states.
let’s
supposed
the
citizen
of
nebraska
brings
a
federal
diversity
case
in
federal
court
against
the
corporation
that
does
some
business
in
nebraska,
and
some
business
elsewhere.
is
the
corporation
a
citizen
of
nebraska,
same
state
so
they
couldn’t
bring
it
or
of
a
different
state
in
which
case
they
could?
a
congressional
statute
answers
this
question
by
stating
that,
“a
corporation
shall
be
deemed
to
a
citizen
of
any
state
by
which
it
has
been
incorporated
and
of
the
state
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business”
that
helps,
but
what
does
principal
place
of
business
mean?
lower
courts
have
reached
different
conclusions,
taking
highly
divergent
approaches
to
the
interpretive
problem.
one
major
treaty
for
example
devotes
73
pages
to
describing
a
host
of
different
tests
used
in
different
circuits,
with
some
circuits
emphasizing
the
locus
of
operations,
others,
the
corporate
nerve
center
and
still
others
working
with
various
combinations
of
plant
size,
service
or
sales
centers,
employment
and
other
factors
designed
to
locate
a
center
of
gravity.
ultimately,
we
conclude
that
the
phrase
“principal
place
of
business”
refers
to
what
some
lower
courts
have
called
the
corporation's
nerve
center.
the
place
where
a
corporation's
officers
direct,
control
and
coordinate
the
corporations
activities.
typically,
the
nerve
center
will
be
found
at
a
corporation's
headquarters.
our
opinion
sets
forth
our
reasons
for
reaching
this
conclusion
in
some
detail.
they
include
our
reliance
upon
the
statute
language,
for
example,
the
phrase
“principal
place
of
business”
that
word
place
is
singular
not
plural
and
the
word
principal
requires
us
to
pick
out
the
main,
prominent
or
leading
place.
but
we
also
place
considerable
weight
upon
the
practical
need
for
administrative
simplicity.
many
of
the
lower
court
tests
complicate
the
case,
eating
up
time
and
money
as
the
parties
litigate
not
the
merits
of
their
claims
but
which
court
is
the
right
court
to
decide
those
merits.
we’ve
recognized
that
there
maybe
no
perfect
test
that
satisfies
all
administrative
and
purposive
criteria,
but
we
believe
a
nerve
center
approach
will
point
courts
in
the
right
direction.
it
will
provide
a
test
that
is
easier
to
apply
most
of
the
time
perhaps
not
all
the
time.
though
it
will
indeed
sometimes
produce
counterintuitive
results
because
the
ninth
circuit
approached
the
jurisdictional
problem
before
us
differ.
we
vacate
its
judgment
and
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
