mr.
todd
m.
schneider
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
50
years
every
circuit
save
the
--
save
the
seventh
had
agreed
--
has
agreed
on
one
overriding
principle:
that
courts
must
perform
a
balancing
in
determining
the
principal
place
of
business
of
a
corporation,
and
that
balancing
must
include
a
determination
of
where
the
corporation's
people
and
property
are.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
in
this
case
noted
that
43
percent
more
employees
for
hertz
are
in
california,
75
percent
more
property,
60
percent
more
revenue,
and--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
i
think
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
the
first
answer
is
that
congress
was
using
a
term
of
art
that
was
imported
from
the
bankruptcy
code.
in
all
of
the
bankruptcy
code
cases
prior
to
1958,
the
11
usc
11
cases
take
an
aggregation
approach
when
they
look
at
it
state-by-state,
so,
if
we
raise
principal
place
of
business
as
a
term
of
art
that
congress
imported
into
this
statute,
then
we
have
to
look
at
an
aggregated
state-by-state
approach.
the
other
answer,
i
think,
is
more
of
a
semantic
answer,
which
is
how
did
congress
define
the
word
"place"?
certainly,
the
english
language
provides
that
a
place
can
be
a
building,
as
hertz
would
have,
or
a
place
could
be
a
state,
as
we
--
my
place
of
birth,
for
example,
is
new
york
state.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
they
didn't,
and
congress
was--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--your
honor,
congress
chose
the
phrase
"principal
place
of
business"
because,
to
quote
the
legislative
history,
there
were
many
cases
on
the
books,
and
it
was
an
easily
understood
phrase.
i
think
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
not
have
us
end
up
here,
to
take
a
phrase
which
was
known
in
the
case
law
and
to
import
it--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--your
honor,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
i
believe
it
was
clear,
from
all
of
the
case
law,
that
we
were
talking
about
place
equalling
an
aggregation
of
all
of
the
activity
in
the
state.
with
regard
to
your
question,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
two
district
court
opinions
that
performed
a
scholarly
review
of
all
of
the
case
law
at
the
time
that
congress
passed
the
1958
amendments.
particularly
of
import
is
the
inland
rubber
case.
and
what
the
court
found
in
the
inland
rubber
case
is,
while
there
was
two
lines
of
thinking,
there
was
the
--
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
nerve
center
line
of
thinking
and
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
business
reality
line
of
thinking.
the
nerve
center
test
could
almost
all
be
explained
by
the
fact
that,
in
those
cases,
the
corporation
only
had
one
place
of
business,
there
were
some
outliers,
but
for
the
most
part,
the
two
judges,
in
the
gilardi
case
and
in
the
inland
rubber
case--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--yes.
that's
the
total
activities
test,
your
honor,
and
the
total
activities
test
would
put
initial
weight
on
the
nerve
center,
but
if
one
--
and
then,
of
course,
weigh
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
predominance
of
all
of
--
of
all
of
the
other
factors
somewhere
in
the
country,
which,
frankly,
is
not
a
lot
different
than
the
ninth
circuit
case
--
test.
the
ninth
circuit
simply
does
it
in
the
other
way.
it
asks--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--it
asks
the
same
question,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
--
a
substantial
predominance
--
finds
substantial
predominance,
not
just
predominance,
but
substantial
predominance.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
i
think,
to
understand
it,
one
must
look
at
the
purpose
of
diversity.
the
real
question
is,
is
diversity
to
be
used
as
a
sword
by
a
corporation,
such
that
a
corporation
can
choose
its
place
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
or
is
it
a
shield
to
protect
the
corporation,
a
truly
foreign
corporation,
from
local
bias?
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
courts
have
found
that
corporations
are
best
known
where
they
have
most
of
their
people
and
their
property.
that's
because
employees
go
out
in
the
community,
property
is
bought
and
sold
in
the
community,
so
the
local
people
will
know
the
corporation
more
where
they
have
their
people
and
property
than,
necessarily,
where
they
have
the
headquarters.
until
this
case
began,
i
had
no
idea
where
hertz
headquarters
are.
there
is
many
corporations
in
the
state
of
california,
that
i
have
no
idea
are
headquartered
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
unless,
of
course,
hertz
were
to
change
its
place
of
incorporation
to
new
jersey.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
i
think
the
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
to
that
question
goes
back
to
how
the
phrase
"principal
place
of
business"
was
looked
at
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
was,
in
fact,
a
state-by-state
analysis,
rather
than
a
state
versus
country
analysis.
now,
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
me,
did
it
mean
that
all
corporations
were
going
to
end
up
being
california
corporations?
california
--
the
ninth
circuit
has
been
doing
it
this
way
for
50
years.
every
other
circuit
has
had
--
save
the
seventh
--
has
had
some
balancing
test
for
50
years,
and
it
has
not
come
to
pass
that
all
corporations
are
california
corporations.
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
think
of
a
corporation
that
sells
skis,
they
are
likely
going
to
be
a
colorado
corporation,
or
they
are
going
to
be
a
utah
corporation.
a
--
a
corporation
that
sells
mining
equipment
is
likely
to
end
up
in
west
virginia
or
one
of
the
mining
states.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
congress
made
a
decision
in
rejecting
the
any
place
where
you
are
doing
business
test,
that
it
would
not
prevent
corporations
from
removing
cases
in
any
state
where
they
are
doing
business.
the
question
in
diversity
jurisdiction
is
not
whether
or
not
a
corporation
should
be
allowed
to
use
the
federal
forum
to
decide
if
that's
the
best
forum
for
it,
but
the
question
is
a
different
one.
will
there
be
bias
in
the
--
in
the
state
court?
and
because
hertz
does
so
much
business
in
california,
it's
hard
to
argue
that
we
bias
by
being
in
the
state
court
in
california.
remember,
this
case--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--congress
had
two
goals,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
goal
was
to
prevent
gaming
of
the
system.
the
simplest
test
is
also
the
most
easily--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--but
even
a
--
even
a
real
headquarters
wouldn't
prevent
gaming
of
the
system.
if
--
if
a
corporation
truly
wanted
to
stay
out
of
state
court
in
a
state
where
it
was
doing
significant
business,
even
all
of
their
business
under
hertz'
test,
they
would
only
have
to
actually
move
their
headquarters
out
of
that
state.
there
is
a
second
reason
that
congress
passed
the
'58
amendment--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--because
the
test
is
only
a
seventh
circuit
test,
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
for
a
corporation--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--it
would,
but
it
wouldn't
be
dispositive.
we
do
know
that
corporations
move
for
all
sorts
of
economic
reasons.
they
move
for
tax
reasons,
they
move
because--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--there
is
--
as
witnessed
by
congressional
findings
in
the
class
action
fairness
act,
there
is
a
perception
that
state
courts
in
certain
states
are
not
good
for
corporations.
whether
that
--
that
perception
is
a
real
perception
or
whether
it's
not
a
real
perception
isn't
before
us
today.
but
if
a
corporation
has
all
of
its
people
and
all
of
its
property
and
is
doing
all
of
its
business
in
one
of
those
states,
the
corporation
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
game
the
system
by
simply
moving
its
headquarters,
it's
real
headquarters
out
of
that
state.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
that
the
case
law
has
borne
that
out.
again,
i
have
read
no
studies
that
say
corporations
are
more
often
california
citizens
simply
because
of
the
population
of
california
--
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
study
hasn't
exist
--
doesn't
exist.
i
simply
haven't
read
it.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
we
do,
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
fact-intensive
test
for
citizenship
for
individuals
based
on
their
intent
to
stay
in
a
place.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
i
do
believe
it
is
less
likely
that
an
individual
would
either
have
the
sophistication
or,
frankly,
the
litigation
volume
to
make
such
a
decision?
but
a
corporation
may,
in
fact.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
second
reason
that
congress
passed
the
'58
amendment
and
that
was
because
of
the
notion
of
overcrowding
of
the
federal
docket
because
too
many
diversity
cases
--
because
there
were
too
many
diversity
cases
because
most
litigation
was
happening
far
away
from
the
facts.
suits
involving
corporations
generally
arise
where
they
have
a
lot
of
contacts
with
the
public,
where
there
people
are
and
where
their
property
are.
if
we
allow
a
corporation
to
move
all
of
its
litigation
where
the
bulk
of
its
people
and
property
are
to
federal
court,
congress's
second
goal--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--the
--
again,
for
50
years,
justice
stevens,
plaintiffs
and
plaintiffs'
lawyers
have
been
able
to
under
the
various
tests
figure
out
where
corporations
are
citizens.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
it
may
or
may
not
be,
depending
upon
the
corporation.
the
vast
majority
of
corporations
are
local
corporations,
so
we
are
really
just
talking
about--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
and
because
most
of
those
entities
are
public
corporations,
there
is
a
lot
of
information
available
in
fcc
filings,
et
cetera,
as
to
where
they
are
actually
doing
business.
you
can
also
simply
look
out
your
door
and
figure
out
whether
have
i
seen
a
lot
of
hertz
outlets
where
i
am.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
under
the
ninth
circuit
test,
the
principal
place
of
starbucks,
there
is
a
case
that
says
starbucks
is
in
california.
let
me
give
you,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
--i
was
--
i
was
surprised
as
well.
but
--
but
let
me
give
you
the
numbers
so
that
it
makes
sense,
because
i
have
read
the
case.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
headquarters
is
in
seattle,
washington.
but
over
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
that's
my
understanding,
yes.
however,
over
100
percent
more
workers
from
starbucks
are
in
california
than
washington.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
i
don't
know
the
total
numbers
of
the
workers.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
i
--
i
don't
know
the
raw
numbers
from
starbucks,
i'm
sorry.
i
just
read
the
opinion.
and
what
the
opinion
tells
us
is
that
starbucks
has
10
percent
of
its
employees
in
washington
and
27
percent
in
california.
over
300
percent
more
of
its
gross
revenue
comes
from
california
than
any
other
state,
200
percent
more
of
its
retail
stores
are
in
california
than
in
any
other
state.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
it
would
--
it
would
be,
your
honor,
wherever
there
is
a
substantial
predominance
of
its
people
and
property.
i
would
assume
--
and
i
don't
know
the
facts
of
eddie
bauer,
but
i
would
assume
eddie
bauer
has
a
central
location
from
which
it
does
its
sales,
which
it
does
its
factory
work,
where
it
is
shipping
things
from.
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
no.
but
by
business
you
mean
revenue,
your
honor?
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
the
test
we
posit,
your
honor,
focuses
on
people
and
property.
the
test
would
look
first
to
the
location
of
employees,
tangible
properties
and
production
activities,
and
then
second
to
income
earned,
purchases
made
and
where
sales
take
place.
mr.
chief
justice,
did
the
court
have
interest
in
the
jurisdictional
argument?
mr.
todd
m.
schneider
okay.
then
if
the
court
has
any
questions
about
the
--
our
jurisdictional
argument,
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
them.
and
without
further
questions--
