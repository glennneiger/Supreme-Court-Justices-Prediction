justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
problem
with
every
test
is
that
you
can
find
an
exception
that
makes
the
application
ridiculous.
let's
assume
that
we
accept
that
headquarters
or
nerve
center
may
have
some
applicability
to
a
corporation
that
has
a
business
in
a
variety
of
different
states.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
that's
--
your
situation
is
perhaps
the
most
attractive--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
whether
california
has
20
percent
and
florida
14
or
15
percent,
to
me
the
differences
are
not
terribly
substantial.
i
can
imagine
mcdonald's
having
1
percent
in
every
part
of
the
world,
and
how
do
you
choose
then?
california
would
say,
then
you
--
you
go
back
to
headquarters.
but
i
don't
know
why
you
start
there.
but
let's
posit
the
simpler
situation.
headquarters
in
new
jersey,
but
everything
else
is
in
california.
your
test
would
ignore
completely
that
--
and
it
depends
on
how
you
define
"headquarters".
if
they
have
three
corporate
executives,
that's
the
entire
extent
--
or
let's
say
one
corporate
executive
who
started
the
company
and
who
lives
in
new
jersey,
and
he
flies
out
to
california
half
the
time
and
runs
the
business
from
there
but
happens
to
live
in
new
jersey.
then
you
would
say
diversity
is
still
new
jersey,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
have
not
articulated
a
--
at
least
to
me,
a
meaningful
principle
in
which
to
set
that
exception.
it
has
to
be
tied
somehow
to
the
test
and
why
the
test
in
some
situations
would
have
applicability
and
others
may
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
i
don't
know
the
difference
between
one
headquarters
and
two
places
to
do
business
or
three,
but
i
can
still
see
that
some
factoring
has
to
be
done
when
the
places
of
business
are
more
limited.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
constitutes
headquarters?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
executives
have
to
live
there?
what
else
has
to
exist
there?
and
then
what
is
the
default
rule
if
those
things
don't
exist?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
all
you
are
talking
about
is
not
necessarily
nerve
center,
because
in
reading
the
examples
in
your
brief,
what
you
are
talking
about
is:
where
is
the
place
where
they
have
the
most
important,
significant,
influential
contact?
now,
the
ninth
circuit
has
defined
that
as
the
place
where
business
is
done;
you
are
suggesting
that
it's
the
place
where
the
nerve
center
is.
but
it
goes
back
to
begging
my
question:
why
--
just
simply
their
declaring
it
on
a
tax
form
doesn't
make
it
important,
influential,
or
significant
contact.
there
has
to
be
something
more
to
the
test,
and
it
can't
be
just
what
i
declare
my
headquarters
to
be.
there
has
to
be
some
form
of
activity
in
that
place.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
--
that's
the
point.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
--
is
there
something
to
a
rule
that
says
headquarters
is
presumptively
the
nerve
center,
but
a
challenged
party,
whoever
that
is,
can
rebut
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
the
point
that
i
raised,
which
is
that
the
headquarters
is
not
an
important,
consequential,
or
substantial.
you
can
rebut
it
if
you
can
show
that
it
is
a
shell
headquarters.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
the
problem,
which
is,
the
party
comes
in,
alleges
by
summary
judgment
that
--
in
a
summary
judgment
motion:
this
is
my
corporate
headquarters.
the
other
side's
going
to
have
to
come
forth
with
evidence
that
shows
something.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
it's
always
a
rebuttable
presumption.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
actually
do
not
know
whether
public
filings
define
what
"headquarters"
mean.
is
there
a
--
i
know
you
have
said
it
in
your
brief,
but
what
i
didn't
know
is
whether
those
public
filings
define
the
activity
necessary
to
designate
a
place
as
"headquarters".
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
--
why
didn't
they
say
place
of
doing
business?
that's
not
the
terminology
that
they
used.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
would
be
more
consistent
with
an
aggregation
of
--
of
all
of
the
factors
the
ninth
circuit
starts
with.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
what's
very
clear
from
all
of
the
articles
i
have
read
in
the
lower
court
decisions
is
that
congress
may
have
thought
it
was
picking
a
well-defined
phrase,
but,
in
fact,
it
wasn't,
that
the
courts
below
are
confused
about
what
they
were
doing
before
the
statute.
so
i
don't
know
why
importing
the
belief
that
something
was
clear
into
a
reality
that
it's
not
helps
us.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
think
that
the
circuits
courts
--
the
vast
majority
of
them,
the
third,
the
first,
the
second,
the
fifth,
they
all
start
with
the
proposition
that,
if
a
place
has
far-flung
businesses,
then
the
nerve
center
test
should
start
the
inquiry
and
control
it
more
than
in
a
situation
where
there
are
lesser
places
of
business?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
a
big
difference.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
you
know,
to
me,
the
word
50
percent.
i'm
having
a
hard
time
understanding
what
the
appreciable
difference
is
between
20
percent
and
14
and
the
balance
being
spread
over
so
many
other
places.
what
--
that
seems
very
arbitrary
in
terms
of
the
place
that
generates
the
most
money.
that's
it.
that's
the
place
you
are
at
home.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
that's
what
--
but
that
goes
back
to
the
point,
if
we
are
talking
about
shields
or
swords,
congress
had
before
it
a
provision
that
would
say,
anywhere
you
do
business,
you
are
not
a
foreigner,
because
you
are
there.
the
people
are
going
to
perceive
you
as
a
business
--
the
local
business
that
is
doing
business
in
that
location,
and
congress
rejected
that.
so
foreign
has
to
have
a
meaning
that
was
somewhat
different.
and
you
don't
think
the
corporate
headquarters
where
management
is,
where
the
direction
for
the
operation
of
the
business
is
coming
from,
is
the
place
that
needs
the
most
protection
in
this
system
because
they
are
the
ones
making
the
decisions,
and
so
aren't
they
the
ones
who
need
to
be
protected
from
local
bias?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
very
first
little
shop
was
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
what
100
percent
means?
are
the
number
of
workers
in
seattle
inconsequential?
is
there
one
worker
there
or
are
we
talking
about
1,000
in--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--isn't
that
important?
as
justice
scalia
said
that
per
capita
california
is
going
to
dwarf
anybody
anywhere
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
multi-location
place
of
business.
so
don't
you
have
to
know
the
raw
numbers?
