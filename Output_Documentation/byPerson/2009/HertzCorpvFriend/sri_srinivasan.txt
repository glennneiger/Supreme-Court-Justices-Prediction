mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
diversity
statute
deems
a
corporation
a
citizen
of,
quote,
"the
state
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
"
closed
quote.
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
holding
that
petitioner
hertz
is
a
citizen
of
california,
even
though
hertz
is
headquartered
in
new
jersey
and
conducts
over
80
percent
of
its
operations
outside
the
state
of
california,
and
even
though,
under
the
court's
approach,
national
corporations
could
regularly
be
deemed
california
citizens
if
they
conduct
operations
in
that
state
that
are
proportional
to
the
state's
population.
the
better
reading
of
the
statute,
in
our
view,
is
that
it
points
to
the
location
of
the
corporation's
headquarters,
the
site
from
which
a
corporation
directs
and
controls
all
the
company's
operations
throughout
all
of
its
locations.
and
that
is
particularly
the
correct
reading
when
the
statutory
language
is
considered
in
light
of
two
considerations.
first,
the
strong
preference
for
simplicity
and
ease
of
administration
in
jurisdictional
rules;
and
second,
congress's
purposes
in
1958
to
preserve
diversity
jurisdiction
for
corporations
in
48
states
and
to
deny
access
to
diversity
jurisdiction
only
in
one
state,
the
state
where
the
corporation
had
its
home
or
principal
place
of
business.
now,
with
respect
to
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
statutory
text,
the
critical
phrase
is
"principal
place
of
business".
and
dictionary
definitions
of
that
term
define
the
term
"principal
place
of
business"
as
corporate
headquarters,
and
that
is
fortified
by
federal
and
state
laws,
which
also
define
the
term
as
"company's
headquarters"--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
we
would,
your
honor.
but
let
me
--
let
me
start
first
with
accepting
your
honor's
premise,
that
in
the
situation
of
a
multistate
corporation
with
--
with
diverse
operations,
the
principal
place
of
business
would
be
the
headquarters.
now,
i
take
your
point
that
there
are
situations
in
which
the
test
may
not
seem
so
straightforward,
but
we
think
even
in
the
--
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
posits,
the
better
answer
--
at
least
our
first
submission
would
be,
the
better
answer
is
the
headquarters
would
control.
and
that's
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
although,
again,
the
one
exception
that
we
would
have
to
our
rule
is
exactly
your
honor's
hypothetical,
and
let
me
just
bracket
that.
now,
the
reason
we
think,
first
and
foremost--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
and
let
me
--
let
me--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
--
well,
we
think
first
and
foremost
that
the
headquarters'
role
would
apply
even
in
your
honor's
situation,
and
i
will
get
to
that
to
the
exception
--
fashioning
the
exception
in
just
one
second--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
and
we
would
certainly
accept
the
resolution
of
the
case
in
--
in
that
light.
if
the
court
were
to
announce
a
rule
that
says,
multistate
corporations
with
diverse
operations,
the
principal
place
of
business
in
that
situation
is
the
headquarters,
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
that
certainly
we
would
prevail
under
that
and
that
would
be
entirely
acceptable
to
us.
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
--
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
we
certainly
don't
want
to
throw
it
away.
we
certainly
don't
want
--
first
and
foremost,
we
would
like
to
prevail.
and
i
think
even
under
the
narrow
approach--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes.
and
--
and
that's
why
we
would
accept
that
result,
justice
ginsburg.
we
certainly
would.
let
me
just
put
that
out
there
first
and
foremost.
now,
with
respect
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
know
that
i,
in
fact,
started
the
answer,
mr.
chief
justice--
[laughter]
--with
respect.
the
answer
is
that
even
in
that
situation,
for
the
reasons
that
justice
scalia
highlights,
we
would
say
that
the
headquarters
controls.
and
let
me
give
two
--
two
principal
reasons
why.
the
first
is
that
even
if
the
operations
are
in
one
state
and
the
headquarters
are
in
a
different
state,
the
headquarters
still
is
where
the
direction
and
control
comes
from.
and
i
think
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
phrase
"principal
place
of
business"
in
that
situation
would
still
direct
attention
to
the
headquarters.
and
the
dictionary
definitions
that
we
identified
in
--
in
our
brief
and
every
federal
and
state
law
that
defines
the
term
"principal
place
of
business"
defines
it
at
headquarters
--
as
headquarters,
without
any
exception
for
the
hypothetical
situation
that
your
honor
posits.
but
the
other--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
your
honor,
i
think
--
and
that
--
that
is
the
sort
of
different
set
of
questions
which
is
other
ambiguities
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
a
headquarters
in
certain
situations.
now,
by
and
large,
the
headquarters
is
relatively
straightforward.
it's
made
in
public
filings
which
are
an
easy
place
to
look,
and
if
you
look
at
the
experience
of
the
seventh
circuit,
which
of
course
has
applied
the
headquarters
approach
across
the
board
over
the
course
of
several
decades,
i
think
we
can
see
that
that
test
has
been
straightforward
and
it
is
simple
in
application,
in
the
main.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
are
not
issues
about
the
definition
of
headquarters
at
the
outer
perimeters.
there
are.
and
i
think
the
place
i
would
look
first
and
foremost
is:
where
does
direction
and
control
for
the
corporation
come
from?
that
is
the
situs
at
which
the
headquarters
would
be
found.
and
i
would
look
also
to
what
a
corporation
itself
identifies
as
headquarters
in
public
filings.
in
10-k
filings
and
under
the
model
business
corporations
act,
corporations
have
to
report
their
headquarters
in
annual
reports.
and
of
course
they
are
doing
those
reports
for
other
reasons
other
than
establishing
jurisdiction
in
a
particular
case,
so
i
think
they
come
with
an
air
of
objectivity
about
them.
that's
where
i
would
look.
now,
i
would
make
this
other
point,
though,
about
the
ambiguity
that
your
honor
points
to
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
a
headquarters.
that
--
that
is
not
at
all
an
ambiguity
that
only
applies
to
our
test,
because
under
respondent's
test
and
under
the
test
of
every
court
of
appeals,
they
take
into
account
the
headquarters.
now,
we
would
think
that
that
is
dispositive.
the
other
courts
consider
it
at
least
highly
relevant,
albeit
not
dispositive.
but
whatever
ambiguities--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
first
in
a
situation
with
a
multistate
corporation
with
dispersed
operations,
as
we
point
out
in
footnote
2
of
our
reply
brief,
i
think
the
courts
of
appeal
are
generally
in
agreement
that
the
headquarters
would
control
in
that
situation.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
you
would
have
an
across-the-board
headquarters
rule,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
what
happened
is,
the
first
court
to
consider
this
question
was
the
third
circuit
in
the
scott
case,
pretty
soon
after
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1958.
and
that
court,
with
respect,
didn't
wrestle
with
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
statutory
terms,
and
it
didn't
wrestle
with
the
strong
premium
on
simple
and
administrable
jurisdictional
rules.
and
then
that
doctrine
sort
of
took
on
a
life
of
its
own,
i
think.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
they
do.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
--
there
is
a
variety
of
different
approaches.
i
think
all
of
them
share
the
common
feature
that
they
consider,
essentially,
a
totality
of
the
circumstances.
and
all
of
them,
in
our
view,
share
a
common
flaw,
which
is--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
the
bankruptcy
courts
--
i
think
the
fairest
assessment
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
as
of
1958
was
that
it
was
a
model.
now,
since
then,
the
collier's
treatise,
for
example,
would
tell
you
that
the
majority
and
predominant
rule
is
the
headquarters
rule,
even
in
the
bankruptcy
context.
pre-1958,
i
think
there
was
a
conflict.
that's
what
the
treatises
said
and
that's
what
we
explain
in
our
brief.
but
there
certainly
were
some
courts
that
adopted
a
headquarters
approach,
even
in
the
bankruptcy
context.
but
i
think
one
thing
i
would
caution
the
court
about
is
assuming
that
just
because
some
courts
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
because
of
bankruptcy-specific
considerations
--
and
a
specific
consideration
was
the
felt
need
to
have
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt
estate
within
the
purview
of
the
court
so
that
the
court
could
administer
the
estate
--
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
import
every
judicial
application
down
to
every
nuanced
detail
in
the
bankruptcy
context
over
to
the
jurisdictional
context,
where
we
know
that
congress
thought
that
simplicity
was
a
real
virtue.
and
i
think,
as
your
honor's
opinion
in
wachovia
v.
schmidt
a
few
terms
ago
points
out,
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
taken
one
word
in
the
venue
context
and
applied
the
exact
same
meaning
to
that
same
word
in
the
jurisdictional
context.
and
here,
because
of
the
strong
preference
--
excuse
me
--
in
favor
of
simplicity
and
administrability
in
jurisdictional
rules,
that
is
a
particularly
poignant
reason
why
the
headquarters
approach,
in
our
--
in
our
point
of
view,
should
govern
in
all
circumstances.
now--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think,
if
--
if
what
you
are
asking,
justice
ginsburg,
is,
where
would
the
principal
place
of
business
be
under
the
bankruptcy
statute,
the
majority
rule
now,
under
the
fifth
circuit
case
commonwealth
oil
refining
and
the
seventh
circuit
case
peachtree,
would
show
that
the
majority
rule
now
is
that
the
principal
place
of
business
would
be
new
jersey.
and
one
point
i
would
like
to
get
to
in
that
regard
is
the
sort
of
oddity
of
saying
that
the
--
the
principal
place
of
business
of
a
company
like
hertz
would
be
somewhere
other
than
new
jersey.
the
ninth
circuit
has
a
view
that
the
principal
place
of
business
of
hertz
is
california,
based
on
the
fact
that
hertz
conducts
20
percent
of
its
business
in
california.
but
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
statute
is
a
zero-sum
game.
so
that
if
hertz
is
deemed
to
have
its
principal
place
of
business
in
california,
such
that
it
is
disabled
from
getting
access
to
diversity
jurisdiction
in
california,
the
consequence
is
that
hertz
would
be
enabled
to
gain
diversity
jurisdiction
in
every
other
state
--
and
i'm
putting
to
one
side
delaware,
the
state
of
incorporation
--
but
it
would
be
enabled
to
gain
access
to
--
to
diversity
jurisdiction
in
every
other
state.
so
the
consequence
would
be
that
if
hertz
were
sued
in
a
state
court
action
in
park
ridge,
new
jersey,
the
site
of
its
headquarters,
hertz
could
get
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
that
jurisdiction
on
the
theory
that
it's
an
out-of-state
company,
it's
a
california
company,
because
it
performs
20
percent
of
its
business
in
california.
now
that
--
the
oddity
of
that,
in
our
view,
is
particularly
poignant
if
one
takes
into
account
a
company
like
wal-mart.
wal-mart
is
universally
recognized
to
be
an
arkansas
corporation
because
it
is
headquartered
in
bentonville,
arkansas,
but
wal-mart
also,
it's
undisputed,
does
substantially
more
business
by
any
of
the
measures
that
the
ninth
circuit
considers
significant
in
texas.
it
has
more
employees
there;
it
has
more
stores
there;
it
generates
more
revenues
there,
by
a
significant
factor
well
in
excess
of
50
percent
over
and
above
any
other
state.
but
the
consequence
of
deeming
wal-mart
a
texas
corporation
based
on
the
amount
of
business
it
does
in
texas
would
be
not
only
that
wal-mart
would
be
disabled
from
getting
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
texas,
but
that
wal-mart
would
be
enabled
to
get
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
bentonville,
arkansas,
on
the
theory
that
even
in
arkansas,
wal-mart
would
be
an
out-of-state
corporation,
a
texas
corporation,
because
of
the
level
of
business
that
it
conducts
in
texas.
and
we
don't
think
that
is
the
result
that
congress
would
have
envisioned
in
1958
when
it
enacted
the
principal
place
of
business
provision.
instead,
what
congress
presumably
had
in
mind
is
that
corporations,
as
a
general
matter,
are
identified
with
the
location
of
their
headquarters.
so
in
the
wal-mart
situation,
wal-mart
rightly
is
universally
acknowledged
to
be
an
arkansas
corporation
because
of
the
presence
in
that
state
of
its
headquarters.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
does,
your
honor,
and
we
think
--
i
guess
the
--
the
comparison
i
would
make
is
to
an
individual,
because
an
individual
can't
declare
that
he
or
she
is
a
domiciliary
of
a
particular
state
and
have
it
be
so
for
citizenship
purposes.
there
has
to
be
something
behind
that,
and
so
too
with
corporations.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
exactly,
and
we
--
we
share
that
view.
a
corporation
couldn't
simply
declare
that
its
headquarters
are
located
in
a
--
in
a
location
where
it
has
a
mailbox,
for
example,
and
have
that
be
dispositive
for
citizenship
purposes.
what--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think
certainly
it
would
be
a
vast
improvement
over
what
the
ninth
circuit
has.
so
i
would
say
that
as
a
starting
point,
your
honor.
i
think
--
in
our
view,
of
course,
a
principal
submission
is
the
headquarters
controls
in
all
--
in
all
situations,
and
the
cost
of
having,
you
know,
a
rebuttable
presumption
would
be:
what
does
it
take
to
rebut
it?
that
would
be
question.
and
i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes.
and
i
think
in
that
situation,
i
guess
--
i
guess
there
is
two
different
ways
that
one
could
look
at
that.
one
is
to
say
that
you
could
rebut
it,
but
the
other
is
to
say
that
it
is
not
the
headquarters.
and
i
guess
that's
the
way
that
i
would
look
at
it,
is
to
say
that
if
the
corporation
identifies
a
location
at
which
it
in
fact
doesn't
direct
and
control
the
operations
of
the
corporation
throughout,
it
wouldn't
constitute
the
headquarters.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
so
i
guess
that's
where
i
would
place
the
load-bearing
weight.
it
may
be
semantic,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
and
if
--
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
is,
your
honor,
and
if
the
other
side
were
able
to
show
that
the
location
that
the
party
identifies
as
--
as
its
headquarters
does
not,
in
fact,
function
as
a
headquarters,
in
the
sense
that
suppose
there
is
no
executives
there,
or
suppose
that
the
officials
that
are
there
in
fact
don't
direct
and
control
the
company's
operations
in
other
locations.
well,
then,
that
--
that
would
be
a
real
issue.
but
there
are
checks
against
that,
because
corporations
identify
their
headquarters
in
other
public
filings,
and
in
the
main,
those
headquarters
are
the
locations
in
--
from
which
the
chief
executives
direct
and
control
the
companies'
operations--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
they
--
they
do
in
the
following
sense,
your
honor.
for
example,
with
the
10-k
report
for
publicly
traded
companies,
i
think
the
question
that
is
asked
is
not
the
location
of
the
headquarters
but
the
location
of
the
principal
executive
offices.
and
so
i
think,
by
definition,
in
answering
that
question
the
principal
executives
would
be
located
at
that
--
at
that
location.
now,
if
they
weren't,
we
would
certainly
take
your
honor's
point
that
there
could
be
a
back-and-forth
about
that,
but
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
in
--
in
response
to
the
latter
point,
your
honor,
i
think
the
one
thing
we
do
know
from
1958
is
that
congress
didn't
think
that
a
corporation
should
be
disabled
from
getting
diversity
jurisdiction
anywhere
where
it
does
a
substantial
business,
because
it
had
that
proposal
before
it,
and
it
rejected
it.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
instead
chose
an
approach
whereby
a
company
is
disabled
from
getting
diversity
jurisdiction
in
one,
and
only
one,
jurisdiction,
the
jurisdiction
in
which
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
and
i
think
what
congress
had
in
mind
is
that
corporations,
as
a
general
matter,
are
identified
with
their
headquarters.
and
that
is
why
wal-mart,
for
example,
is
universally
recognized
as
an
arkansas
company.
it
may
be
that
wal-mart
does
substantial
business
in
texas,
substantially
in
excess
of
other
states,
but
wal-mart
also
does
substantial
business
in
a
variety
of
jurisdictions.
but
congress
decidedly
didn't
have
the
rule
that
says
wherever
wal-mart
does
a
substantial
business
and
is
a
well
recognized
company,
it
should
be
disabled
from
getting
to
federal
court.
it
limited
it
to
one
jurisdiction.
and
we
think
the
best
reading
of
the
phrase
"principal
place
of
business"
is
the
situs
of
the
headquarters
in
that
there
were
--
with
--
with
respect
to
the
bankruptcy
decisions,
your
honor,
there
--
there
were
bankruptcy
courts
that
did
have
a
"headquarters"
approach.
and,
in
fact,
the
one
bankruptcy
court
of
which
i
am
aware
that
looked
at
the
meaning
of
the
ordinary
language
--
we
cite
the
--
the
relevant
--
the
portion
of
the
court's
opinion
at
page
50
of
our
opening
brief
in
footnote
5.
it
is
the
first
circuit's
opinion
in
the
burdick
case.
and
what
the
first
circuit
said
was
that
a
corporation's,
quote,
"principal
office",
rather
than
a
factory,
mill
or
mine,
according
to
ordinary
understanding
and
speech,
constitutes
the
principal
place
of
business
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
so
even
before
1958,
i
think
there
was
definitely
a
sense
out
there
that
the
term
"principal
place
of
business"
does
mean
headquarters.
and
this
gets
to
your
honor's
other
question
which
is:
if
congress
really
meant
"headquarters",
why
wouldn't
they
have
used
the
term
"headquarters"
instead
of
"principal
place
of
business"?
and
i
think
our
answer
to
that,
with
respect
to
your
honor,
is
that
"principal
place
of
business"
is
an
alternative
formulation
for
"headquarters".
and
so
i
don't
think
one
can
glean
too
much
from
the
fact
that
congress
chose
"principal
place
of
business"
rather
than
"headquarters"
when
"principal
place
of
business"
in
our
view
is
a
reference
to
the
headquarters.
and
this
court's
opinion
last
term
in
the
oswell
harlow
versus
united
states
case
is
a
good
example
of
that,
because
there
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
used
the
term
"facilitate"
rather
than
the
term
"aid
or
abet".
and
one
could
have
readily
made
the
argument
that
because
the
statute
uses
the
term
"facilitate"
rather
than
"aid
or
abet",
that
normal
principles
that
accompany
aiding
and
abetting
liability
shouldn't
apply
in
the
statute.
but
the
court
rightly
in
our
view
reached
the
contrary
conclusion,
and
it
was
based
on
the
notion
that
the
term
"facilitate",
according
to
black's
law
dictionary,
means
the
very
same
thing
as
"aid
or
abet".
and
once
you
cross
that
bridge,
then
you
can
apply
aiding
or
abetting
principles
to
the
term
"facilitate".
and
here,
likewise,
the
term
"principal
place
of
business",
according
to
black's
law
dictionary,
means
"headquarters".
that's
how
black's
law
dictionary
defines
the
term.
and
so
the
fact
that
congress
chose
one
alternate
formulation
versus
another,
i
don't
think
speaks
too
loudly
to
the
question
of--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure,
and
--
and,
again,
i
would
look
at
the
public
filings.
in
the
public
filings
in
the
10-k,
for
example,
hertz
universally
identifies
its
headquarters
as
park
ridge,
new
jersey.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
chief
executive
officials
are
all
located
in
park
ridge.
now,
there
is
a
large
administrative
apparatus
in
oklahoma
city,
and,
according
to
the
affidavit,
its
administrative
activities
are
performed
in
oklahoma
city
to
a
lesser
extent.
and
that
is
at
paragraph
11
of
the
affidavit,
which
is
at
pages
29a
to
30a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
real
dispute
that
hertz's
main
headquarters
are
located
in
park
ridge
rather
than
oklahoma
city.
in
point
of
fact,
what
you
have
in
oklahoma
city
--
and
--
and
this
isn't
spelled
out
in
the
--
in
the
affidavit,
but
what
you
have
in
oklahoma
city
is
essentially
the
rental
call
center
and
plus
principal
back-office
duties
like
information
technology
support.
but
what
you
have
in
park
ridge
is
all
of
the
company's
chief
executives.
so
the
decision
making
locus
for
the
company's
most
important
decisions
is
absolutely
in
park
ridge,
new
jersey,
rather
than
oklahoma
city.
and
there
is
no
dispute
on
the
point
that
is
before
the
court.
this
court
comes
--
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
the
assumption
that
hertz's
headquarters
are
located
in
park
ridge.
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
that
headquarters
location
should
be
dispositive
for
purposes
of
defining
a
company's
principal
place
of
business.
now,
if
i
could
--
if
i
could
turn
for
one
moment
to
the
cost
in
terms
of
simplicity
and
demonstrability
of
an
alternative
formulation
if
the
court
were
to
accommodate
a
formulation
that
didn't
look
to
the
headquarters,
we
see
three
potential
categories
of
costs
that
are
brought
about
by
the
--
the
proposed
approach
of
respondents
in
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
established.
the
first
is
the
one
that
underlies
the
strong
preference
in
favor
of
simple,
demonstrable,
jurisdictional
rules.
and
that
is
just
the
time
and
resources
that
would
be
invested
at
the
threshold
jurisdictional
stage
in
defining
whether
the
case
is
--
is
before
the
proper
court.
that
in
itself
is
reason
enough,
in
our
view--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right.
yes,
that's
our
point,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
a
"headquarters"
test
is
simple
and
straightforward
in
that
respect,
and
a
"totality
of
circumstances"
approach
isn't.
but
there
is
also
two
additional
costs
that
i
would
point
out
about
a
"totality
of
circumstances"
approach.
one
is
that
you
can
have
the
very
real
possibility
because
of
the
indeterminacy
in
that
approach
that
different
courts
would
reach
divergent
conclusions
about
the
citizenship
of
the
very
same
corporation.
and
as
we
point
out
on
page
40
of
our
brief,
that
has
already
happened.
two
district
courts
in
the
ninth
circuit
alone
in
two
california
courts
reached
divergent
conclusions
on
the
citizenship
of
united
airlines.
one
court
concluded
that
united
was
an
illinois
citizen,
and
another
court
concluded
that
united
was
a
california
citizen.
and
that
is
not
altogether
surprising
that
you
would
have
those
sorts
of
divergent
conclusions
given
the
open-ended
nature
of
the
"totality
of
circumstances"
approach.
the
third
cost
that
i
would
point
to
is
the
possibility
that
because
of
the
indeterminacy
in
the
approach
you
could
have
a
situation
in
which
a
district
court
finds
there
is
jurisdiction,
proceeds
to
have
a
trial
on
the
merits
and
renders
--
renders
judgment
on
the
merits,
and
then
several
years
later
the
court
of
appeals
would
reverse
the
judgment
because
the
district
court
had
gotten
the
jurisdictional
input
wrong
at
the
outset.
and,
again,
that
also,
as
with
the
situation
with
divergent
conclusions
on
the
citizenship
of
the
same
corporation,
is
not
just
a
problem
of
theory.
it
has
actually
happened.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
--
i
guess
my
point
is
that
precisely
because
subject-matter
jurisdiction
can
be
raised
at
any
point--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure,
right.
i
guess
what
my
point
is
that
you
could
have
a
situation
where
a
trial
court
has
reached
a
resolution
on
the
merits.
several
years
--
several
years
later
the
court
of
appeals
on
direct
review
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
district
court
got
it
wrong
on
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
there
is
a
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
diaz
--
diaz
versus
pep
boys
case,
that
involve
that
situation.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
your
honor,
just
one
point
and
i
will
be
brief.
the
idea
that
corporations
would
switch
their
--
location
of
their
headquarters
in
order
to
achieve
jurisdictional
results
hasn't
been
borne
out
in
any
example
in
which
i'm
aware.
and
there
is
a
fundamental
reason
why.
when
a
corporation
decides
to
relocate
its
headquarters,
it's
making
a
very
important
business
decision
about
what
is
the
location
from
which
its
direction
and
control
is
going
to
emanate.
that
is
not
a
gamesmanship
decision.
that's
a
bona
fide
decision
about
where
its
headquarters
are
going
to
be
located
and
where
its
most
important
decision
--
business
decisions
are
going
to
be
made.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
does.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
