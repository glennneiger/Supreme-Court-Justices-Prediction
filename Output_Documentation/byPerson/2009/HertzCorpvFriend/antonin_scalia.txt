justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
would
we
say
that?
just
because
it
wins
your
case
and
it
solves
your
problem?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
to
do
that,
you
abandon
your
principal
argument,
which
that
--
which
is
that
"place"
doesn't
mean
"state".
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
talk
about
the
whole
state
of
california
as
the
principal
place
of
doing
business
--
i
mean,
if
congress
meant
that,
it
would
have
said,
the
principal
state
in
which
business
is
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
to
throw
away
that
good
argument,
do
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
--
more
than
what,
more
than
any
other
single
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
say
the
--
the
"principal
state
of
business".
it's
the
"principal
place
of
business".
is
there
a
difference
between
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why,
somehow,
a
californian
is
more
likely
to
identify
with
hertz,
simply
because
there
are
more
californians
and,
hence,
more
hertz
outlets,
than
a
new
jerseyite
is
likely
to
identify
with
hertz.
per
capita,
there
are
probably
as
many
hertz
outlets
in
new
jersey
as
there
are
in
california.
the
only
reason
that
you
come
up
with
california
is
it's
an
enormous
state.
it
has
10
percent
of
the
population.
but
as
far
as
the
citizens
of
the
state
identifying
with
that
--
with
that
company
and,
therefore,
the
unfairness
of
--
of
letting
that
company
--
you
know,
remove
to
federal
court,
new
jersey
and
california
are
absolutely
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
one
of
the
factors
in
other
--
in
other
states
as
well.
it's
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
you
certainly
increase
your
odds
to
move
your
headquarters.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
worry
about
private
individuals
gaming
the
system,
do
we,
by
--
you
know,
in
--
in
order
to
get
into
or
out
of
federal
court,
establishing
residence
in
a
different
state?
we
don't
worry
about
them
gaming
the
system,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
but
--
but
you
can
have
a
genuine
intent
to
go
somewhere
else,
and
i
don't
know
that
people
do
it
for
foreign
reasons
because
they
want
to
get
in
or
out
of
federal
court.
you
really
don't
worry
about
that,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
some
rich
individuals
that
might
have
the
incentive.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
surprise.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that
means
that
its
principal
officers
and
their
families
have
to
move.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
biggest
disincentive
it
seems
to
me.
