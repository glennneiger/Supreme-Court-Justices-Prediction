justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
case
doesn't
call
for
that
judgment,
because
you
have
a
multistate
corporation,
and
it
--
i
assume
you
would
be
satisfied
with
saying
that
when
a
corporation
has
dispersed
operations,
it
doesn't
have
its
business
center
or
its
headquarters
--
doesn't
have
its
business
center
dominant
in
any
one
state,
that
it's
dispersed,
then
you
take
the
headquarters,
because
there's
no
way
to
pick
among
--
choose
all
the
others,
and
it
certainly
isn't
worth
the
labor
to
try
to
do
that.
so
you
could
have
a
rule
that
says,
dispersed
across
many
states,
you
pick
headquarters.
and
that
--
you
don't
have
to
urge
anything
further.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
never
get
to
california's
thing
about
state.
if
you
say
multistate,
you
pick
the
place.
the
headquarters
is
the
place,
it's
within
a
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
did
the
others
all
go
through
some
through
total,
totality
of
the
factors
test?
i
mean,
obviously,
you
could
pick
the
headquarters.
you'd
say
congress
wanted
one
place;
headquarters
is
a
logical
choice,
end
of
--
but
most
circuits
have
made
it
more
complicated
than
that.
the
seventh
circuit
is
the
only
one
who
said,
keep
it
simple,
as
you
urge
--
headquarters.
why
are
the
other
circuits
resistant
to
the
solution
that
you
are
proposing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it
--
they
--
they
do
it
in
different
ways.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some
say
business
operations,
some
say
headquarters.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
--
how
do
the
bankruptcy
courts
do
it?
i
mean,
you
brought
out
that
1332,
1958.
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
--
that
it
is
inevitably
headquarters
for
the
bankruptcy
courts.
i
mean,
there's
--
sometimes
it
is
in
other
places,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
case
--
this
is
purely
hypothetical,
but
suppose
hertz
were
to
be
bankrupt,
file
a
petition
in
bankruptcy,
where
--
new
jersey
would
be
the
place,
on
your
--
or
the
assets
are
dominantly
someplace
else,
so
it
would
be
another
place?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know,
but
didn't
congress
pick
"a
principal
place
of
business"?
and
we
know
that
they
looked
at
the
bankruptcy
courts.
there
are
lots
of
expressions
in
other
statutes.
some
say
"headquarters".
some
say
--
well,
there
are
a
variety
of
things,
but
congress
picked
this
particular
term,
"principal
place
of
business".
and
i
was
thinking,
when
you
gave
the
example
of
texas,
that
the
idea
of
diversity
is
you
are
not
going
to
get
a
federal
forum
where
you
are
at
home.
and
so
one
would
think,
well,
if
wal-mart
is
doing
so
much
in
texas,
it's
really
no
stranger
in
texas.
why
shouldn't
there
be
diversity
in
texas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
rejected
it,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
her
argument
that
--
that
hertz
has
this
new
jersey
headquarters,
but
its
reservation
center
is
in
oklahoma?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
--
even
when
the
direct
--
the
--
even
subject-matter
jurisdiction
is
precluded
after
final
--
final
judgment
after
direct
--
so
that's
a
little
extreme,
the
example
you
gave.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
any
point
in
the
direct
--
up
to
denial
of
cert
on
direct
review.
after
that
it's
precluded,
even
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
you
can't
collaterally
attack
on
that
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
with
your
--
your
approach
--
and
california
is
unique
in
this
respect,
is
--
california
is
a
very
large
state,
lots
of
business,
and
you
are
comparing
to
the
next
state
that
has
the
next
number
of
employees
--
you
know,
florida.
if
i
were
entertaining
your
approach,
i
would
think,
well,
you
would
compare
california
against
the
whole
rest
of
the
nation
and
not
pick
for
a
dispersed
--
a
corporation
that
is
widely
dispersed.
california
is
going
to
be
the
big
winner
in
this.
it's
going
to
be
able
to
keep
all
those
cases
in
its
state
court
because
so
many
multi-state
corporations,
i
imagine,
would
come
out,
just
the
way
hertz
does.
am
i
right,
that,
under
your
analysis,
the
one
place
where,
if
you
say,
we
don't
want
federal
courts
to
be
dealing
with
corporations
that
are
at
home
in
the
state,
but
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
under
your
view
of
things,
a
new
jersey
citizen
could
sue
hertz
in
federal
court
in
new
jersey,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
do
you
say,
well
--
why
is
it
that
the
ninth
circuit's
method,
california
versus
florida,
instead
of
california
and
let's
see
what
the
rest
of
the
business
is
--
is,
in
the
whole
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
cannot
be
advised
by
the
state
court
in
new
jersey
either.
the
--
you
correctly
pointed
out
that
congress
said
place
of
business.
it
didn't
even
do
as
it
did
with
--
it
didn't
do
as
it
did
with
--
with
corporate
citizenship,
that
is
you
could
be
a
citizenship
of
as
many
states
as
you
incorporate
in.
but
if
it's
got
to
be
one
place,
so
why
not
just
keep
it
simple
and
say
presumptively
it's
the
business
headquarters,
in
a
particular
case
you
could
show
otherwise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be
a
phony
headquarters.
but
nobody
is
suggesting
that
--
that
the
headquarters
of
hertz
in
new
jersey,
that
that's
a
sham
set-up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
phenomenon?
i
mean,
i
can
see
that
as
a
hypothetical,
but
does
it
happen
in
the
real
world,
that
a
corporation
moves
its
headquarters
in
order
to
escape
the
federal
courts
in
a
particular
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
would
they
move
simply
to
avoid
a
federal
court
or
to
gain
access
to
the
federal
court
in
a
particular
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
are
not
talking
about
all.
i
mean,
that
would
be
--
that's
why
you
make
it
a
presumption,
the
headquarters
is
a
presumption
which
could
be
rebutted.
but
you
are
not
talking
about
all
business.
you
are
talking
about
california
where
there
is
a
sizeable
amount
of
business,
simply
because
it's
the
size
of
the
state,
the
population
of
the
state.
and
i
would
understand
your
position
better
if
you
would
say,
well,
we
would
measure
against
the
entirety
of
the
united
states.
but
california
is
going
to
come
out
the
winner
much
more
often
than
any
other
state
under
this
test
simply
because
of
its
size.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
--
where
is
its
headquarters.
