justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
was
on
the
third
circuit
for
eight
years
under
this
regime.
and
it
didn't
seem
to
me
that
the
sky
was
falling.
in
fact
i
can't
remember
any
cases,
any
appeals
involving
this
issue,
and
we
had
lots
of
cases
of
a
variety
of
kinds.
so
maybe
there's
--
i
don't
want
to
be
a
witness
in
this,
but
you
know,
convince
me
that
the
sky
really
will
fall
if
we
were
to
adopt
this.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
eleventh
circuit
was
wrong
on
that
issue?
didn't
they
hold
that
this
was
--
this
was
separate
from
the
merits?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
--
are
you
arguing
that
the
collateral
order
door
is
closed
now?
that
--
that
nobody
else
is
going
to
get
through
that
door?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
an
interlocutory
appeal
doesn't
have
to
stop
everything,
does
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.
kneedler,
is
true
that
true,
that
the
case
goes
on?
isn't
it
true
that
of
the
civil
cases
that
get
through
discovery,
only
a
tiny
percentage
ever
come
to
an
appealable
final
judgment?
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
these
things
are
settled,
are
they
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right,
because
there
never
could
be
an
appeal.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
means
that
the
erroneous
--
if
there
was
an
erroneous
ruling,
it's
built
into
the
--
it's
irretrievably
built
into
--
well
not
irretrievably,
but
powerfully
built
into
the
bargaining--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
the
privilege
were
in
a
statute,
that
would
make
a
difference?
