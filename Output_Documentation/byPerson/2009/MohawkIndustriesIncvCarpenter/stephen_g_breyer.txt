justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
think
that
your
--
that
this
privilege
--
or
is
it
--
more
important
than
any
other
privilege?
i
mean,
justice
scalia's
question
and
your
answer
convinced
me
that
you
can
protect
this
the
same
as
you
can
any
other
trade
secret
--
any
trade
secret.
of
course,
you
do
disclose
it
to
the
opposing
party,
but
that
is
also
true
of
any
breach
of
any
privilege,
so
husband-wife,
priest-penitent,
psychiatrist
and
patient.
i
take
all
of
those
are
privileged.
do
we
allow
collateral
appeals
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
we
don't
allow
collateral
appeals
with
the
husband
and
wife,
with
the
priest
and
--
and
someone
in
--
you
know,
confession
or
something,
i
don't
--
with
a
priest,
or
with
a
psychiatrist
who
is
dealing
with
a
patient,
why
would
we
allow
collateral
appeal
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
if
we
grant
your
collateral
appeal,
don't
we
have
to,
perhaps,
equally
grant
it
in
every
situation,
where
a
judge
arguably
makes
an
erroneous
ruling
on
a
question
of
privilege?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
--
in
your
opinion,
it's
more
important
to
protect
the
lawyers,
who
talk
to
clients,
from
erroneous
rulings,
than
protect
the
priest
or
protect
the
wife
or
husband
or
protect
the
psychiatrist
who
is
dealing
with
a
patient?
now,
that's
hard
for
me
to
see
why.
i
mean,
i
think
lawyers
are
very
important,
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
why
they
are
more
important
than
these
other
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so,
i
think
any
system
of
--
that
denies
you
the
interlocutory
appeal,
will,
in
fact,
work
some
injustice.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
any
system
that
allows
too
many
interlocutory
appeals
wrecks
the
judicial
system
through
delay.
now,
i
think
on
that
kind
of
question
which
is
here,
maybe
there
is
some
information
that
you
come
across
with
the
aba,
for
example,
which
has
300,000
--
maybe
600
--
you
know,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
members.
there
might
be
instances
in
the
circuits
where
appeal
was
denied,
where
the
lawyers
would
say,
my
goodness,
appeal
was
denied,
i
want
to
tell
you
the
hardship
that
that
worked.
has
anyone
gone
around
and
tried
to
find
if
there
are
such
instances,
as
there
must
be,
how
serious
it
was?
how
harmful,
how
often
do
we
have
any
empirical
information
on
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
wrong
for
me
to
expect
that
if
this
would
work,
a
lot
of
instances
of
serious
hardship
not
allowing
the
appeal,
some
lawyers
in
their
meetings
would
be
upset
and
they
would
raise
a
few
examples?
so
doesn't
the
fact
that
you
have
been
unable
to
find
any
tend
to
count
against
you?
