ms.
judith
resnik
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
before
1997,
no
circuit
held
that
there
was
appeal
as
of
right
for
privilege
or
waiver,
and
most
of
the
circuits
continue
that
approach.
that
is
the
right
approach
because
attorney-client
privilege
cases
do
not
fit
the
parameters
of
the
cohen
appealability
and
there
are
alternative
responses
that
are
available
on
the
remedial
side.
in
terms
of
the
cohen
factors,
the
factor
of
importance
which
has
just
been
discussed
here,
this
court
has
over
the
60
years
of
some
30
opinions
refined
the
importance
test
and
moved
it
away
from
the
questions
of
place,
shape
of
litigation,
dynamics
of
litigation,
to
a
very
narrow
set
of
cases
in
which
a
government
is
typically
a
party
or
a
government
official,
and
there
is
a
very
significant
either
constitutional
or
statutory
question
principally
of
immunity
from
suit.
ms.
judith
resnik
i
think
the--
ms.
judith
resnik
--as
i
understand
the
government's
position
here,
it's
that
ordinary
lawyers
don't
get
the
privilege
in
ordinary
litigation.
the
government
is
here
to
speak
to
the
question
of
state
secrets
and
particular
kinds
of
particular
official
privileges,
but
not
to
the
regular
case.
and
i
think
it's
important
that
we
understand
from
the
presence
of
them
that
this
is
a
rule
that
is
appropriate
for
lawyers
on
all
sides
of
the
fence,
because
the
immediate
availability
of
appeal
as
a
right
stops
in
the
tracks.
the
case
was
decided
at
the
district
court
in
october
of
2007
and,
holding
aside
these
proceedings,
it
was
august
of
2008
when
the
eleventh
circuit
rejected
the
mandamus
and
the
appeal.
so
the
wisdom
of
the
final
judgment
rule
is
precisely
because
the
cost
and
delay,
particularly
in
the
area
of
discovery
and
evidentiary
privileges,
is
so
significant
given
that
there
are
so
many
of
these.
and
one
of
the
important--
ms.
judith
resnik
--well,
there
are
remedies
--
there
are
two
directions
for
an
answer.
one
is
that
in
all
the
courts
of
appeal
of
the
three
circuits
that
have
this
rule,
work
product
as
well
as
attorney-client
privilege
is
available
on
appeal
in
the
third
circuit.
trade
secrets
is
available,
although
the
third
circuit
has
now
raised
questions
given
will
v.
hallock
and
cunningham
about
whether
or
not
this
remains
a
viable
position,
but
trade
secrets
is
available.
psychotherapists
is
appealable,
spouse
is
appealable,
and
nontestifying
experts
as
well.
which
is
the--
ms.
judith
resnik
--well,
the
third,
the
ninth
and
the
d.c.
together
are
the
three
that
have
opened
up
the
door,
and
they
have
found
--
the
experience
of
those
appellate
judges
has
not
found
that
it
is
easy
to
make
the
distinction
among
these,
and
as
a
consequence
there
is
appeal
as
of
right
to
this
entire
cluster
of
cases.
ms.
judith
resnik
well,
i
take
to
be
--
the
cheerful
news
is
that
by
and
large
everyone
is
getting
it
right
at
the
trial
level.
but
we
are
looking
at
the
question
--
first
of
all,
one
question
would
be
how
to
count
the
cases
of
whether
there's
these
other
appeals
as
well.
but
more
importantly,
both
the
law
professor
and
judge
amici
in
our
brief
asked
to
look
at
the
pipeline,
and
there
are
two
levels
of
the
pipeline,
or
three.
one
is
that
in
the
district
courts
we
try
to
look
at
the
numbers
of
instances
when
trial
judges
write
opinions,
magistrate
and
district
judges,
which
is
only
the
tip
of
that
iceberg.
as
best
we
can
tell,
somewhere
between
10
and
30
times
a
month
in
westlaw
reports
one
can
find
a
conclusion
either
upholding
or
denying
disclosure.
moreover
it's
sequential--
ms.
judith
resnik
--we
found
about
half
the
cases,
and
the
law
professors
amici
and
judges
amici
found
about
104,
in
which
in
which
disclosure
was
required,
in
the
six-month
period.
so
there
is
a
significant
number
at
the
trial
level
that
exists
in
terms
of
the
pipeline.
if
we
go
just
to
the
case
that
is
before
you,
the
federal
district
judge
reserved
question
on
a
second
attorney-client
privilege
question
because
issuing
a
protective
order
on
the
deposition,
there
is
a
related
case
here
and
he
precluded
the
lawyers
from
participating
in
it.
ms.
judith
resnik
i
am
not
going
to
convince
you
that
the
sky
is
going
to
fall,
but
i
am
going
to
suggest
that
the
cohen
rule
does
not
apply
to
these
cases
not
only
because
the
sky
isn't
going
to
fall.
the
empirical
question
is
there
will
be
more
cases
for
sure
and
there
will
be
more
people
with
comparable
privileges
knocking
at
the
appellate
doors,
and
they'll
be
sorting,
so
that
goes
to
the
county.
do
we
count
the
cases
that
knocked
and
you
said
no
to
as
well
as
the
cases
you
said
yes
to.
the
other
case
is
that
the
cohen
rule
requires
a
particular
kind
of
importance
and
a
particular
kind
of
severability.
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
said,
in
fairness,
there
has
been
a
waiver
because
you've
injected
new
issues
in
the
case.
in
order
to
get
to
the
in
fairness
waiver
injection,
you
have
to
know
the
facts
of
the
case
and
weigh
the
waiver
against
the
other
facts
in
the
case.
ms.
judith
resnik
in
our
view,
every
one
of
the
--
this
case
failed
the
test
on
all
four
--
three
to
four
of
the
cohen
prongs,
which
is
separability
and
conclusiveness
or
--
or
distinct
ideas,
potentially,
importance,
and
remediability.
and
therefore,
the
embeddedness
here
is
typical
of
cases,
crimestar
was
an
example
already
mentioned,
in
which
the
factual
predicates
are
here.
in
terms
of
coming
back
to
the
piecemeal,
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
reserved
the
question.
the
lawyers
below
have
asked
for
a
pre-ruling.
the
questions
to
be
asked
at
the
deposition
will
not
waive
attorney-client
privilege.
the
trial
judge
said,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
it
hasn't
been
fully
breached
and
we
don't
know
what
you
are
going
to
ask.
therefore,
in
this
very
case,
if
the
rule
were
that
you
could
appeal
as
a
right,
you
could
be
back
in
this
case
twice
to
the
eleventh
circuit
during
the
pendency
of
the
case.
ms.
judith
resnik
well,
cohen
involved
the
major
question
of
the
application
of
the
erie
principle
in
1949
involving
a
state
--
the
right
of
security
for
expenses.
and
i
would
take
cohen
and
the
vale
case
and
the
drugging
case
of
sell
as
instances
in
which,
is
the
litigant,
during
the
pendency
of
the
case,
going
to
be
economically
secure
or
free,
or
drugged
or
not
drugged,
as
distinct
qualities
which
are
all
framed
in
either
state
law
or
constitutional
premises.
if
we
look
over
the
course
of
the
60
years,
the
category
is
not
neat.
but
the
turning
point
is
in
1978
with
the
coopers
opinion
which
says
death
knell,
which
says
strategic
interactions,
the
shape
of
class
actions,
is
not
available
for
appeal
as
a
right.
in
1994,
one
might
have
thought
of
the
digital
case
that
a
contract
not
to
continue
by
--
just
settle
would
have
been
within
the
set,
but
the
court
said,
no,
that
kind
of
private
contractual
interest
is
not
sufficient.
and
in
2006,
in
the
will
case,
the
court
narrowed
it
again
by
saying
the
res
judicata
sequence
is
insufficient.
so
in
the
last
decade
the
cohen
cases
have
come
down
to
basically
qualified
immunity
or
constitutionally-freighted
--
structural
or
almost
abstract,
not
interpersonal
dynamics
of
the
litigation,
including
contractual
relationships
or
evidentiary
privileges.
ms.
judith
resnik
well,
cohen
predates
this
--
the
congress's
creation
of
1292(b),
which
you
mentioned
earlier,
justice
ginsburg.
and
so
what
it
is
looking
at
is,
when
cohen
was
initially
decided
it
opened
a
window,
but
in
the
relationship
between
court
and
congress,
the
judicial
conference
went
to
the
congress
and
said,
we
need
a
broader
window,
and
congress
adopted
verbatim
in
1958
the
1292(b)
criteria
which,
clearly,
cohen
would
have
been
eligible
for
or
potentially
eligible
for,
and
there
are
attorney-client
privilege
cases
that
do
go
off
under
1292(b).
ms.
judith
resnik
there
are
a
few
selective
waiver
cases.
there
are
a
few
of
these
that
come
up,
but
you
are
completely
right
that
it
is
a
hurdle
but
we
have
alternatives
here
as
well.
as
the
example
of
the
--
once
the
federal
court
study
committee
suggested
we
needed
more
appeal
rights
after
the
coopers
case,
congress
responded
by
authorizing
the
court
through
its
rulemaking
to
provide
interlocutory
orders
as
final,
and
23(f)
is
the
next
example,
which
also
provides
the
mechanism.
the
basic
point
is
that
there
are
other
routes.
the
remedial
prong
of
cohen
is
amply
responded
to
here,
because
first,
internal
to
the
case,
there
could
be
protective
orders
and
limited
disclosure.
second,
you
can
take
the
issue
and
stipulate
it
against
you.
third,
you
could
actually,
if
you
ever
did
go
to
trial,
not
testify.
that's
the
jackie
b.
redman
scenario.
fourth,
you
have
the
after-a-fact
appeal.
fifth,
mandamus
is
available,
and
there
are
circuit
courts.
ms.
judith
resnik
in
the
extraordinary
case
there
is
mandamus.
there
is
also
certification,
and
all
of
these
are
routes
that
are
filtered.
cohen
opens
the
door
completely.
ms.
judith
resnik
i
can't
forecast
future
cases,
except
to
say
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
in
the
last
decade
narrowed
the
door
substantially.
and
i
take
it
it
has
come
in
relationship
to
the
door
opening
through
the
other
mechanisms,
congressional
carve-ups
like
the
classified
informations
procedure
act,
the
congressional
carve-up
in
catha,
and
each
of
those
isn't
a
wide-open
door,
but
either
discretionary
or
timeframed
or
limited.
and
of
course,
that
goes
to
the
problem
that
an
interlocutory
appeal
really
is
interlocutory
and
stops
everything,
whereas
the
23(f)
rule
says
absent
the
court
order,
there's
nothing
stayed
at
the
district
court
level.
ms.
judith
resnik
the
--
as
a
rule
of
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
with
a
court
of
appeal
at
the
--
a
statutory
rule
provision
puts
the
--
stays
the
district
court
activity.
that's
why
23(f)
moderates
that
rule,
as
i
understand
it.
further,
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
the
question
here
in
terms
of
importance.
rule
501
and
502
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
number
502
has
just
been
reworked.
501
remains
that
in
some
of
these
the
existence
of
the
privilege
will
arise
--
will
be
a
question
of
state
law.
i
know
of
no
one
of
the
erie
cases
in
which
the
interlocutory
appellate
question
turns
on
the
question
of
state
law
as
a
predicate,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
rule
is
that
it's
when
there's
an
adverse
privilege
ruling
that
you
get
appeal
as
a
right.
it's
--
that's
the
d.c.
circuit's
rule
for
--
and
indeed,
it
had
several
of
these,
not
very
many,
but
a
few
of
these
cases.
so
then
502
has
just
come
with
the
workings
of
the
judicial
conference
and
the
congress
together,
and
the
lawyers,
to
shape
a
rule
that
is
very
protective
of
inadvertent
waiver,
protective
about
its
sequential
impacts
as
well,
and
articulating
and
federalizing
that
area
of
law,
as
well
as
providing
under
502(a)
for
--
if
you
waive
in
the
course
of
a
federal
proceeding,
502
organizes
the
way
a
district
court
should
think
about
it.
if
there
were
appeal
as
a
right
of
waiver
right
now,
after
this
case,
then
all
those
502
cases
could
come
directly,
whereas
instead
a
few
might
get
here
or
not
by
1292(b).
and
again,
if
it
looked
like
there
needed
to
be
a
wholesale
reworking
because
of
the
vulnerability
of
the
system,
then
the
court
and
committee
working
with
the
lawyers
can
draft
together
some
revision.
but
the--
ms.
judith
resnik
--well,
it
is
the
case
that
judge
wilkinson
recently
reiterated
judge
friendly's
suggestion
that
--
or
commentary
that
contempt
is
a
provision
that
is
available.
and
it
is
a
route.
but
we've
found--
ms.
judith
resnik
--what
--
we
have
found
that
many
courts
of
appeals
have
responded,
precisely
because
of
either
the
draconian
nature
of
criminal
contempt
or
the
possibility
that
it
won't
issue,
by
looking
at
some
of
these
cases,
in
the
extraordinary
instance,
through
mandamus
and
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
mandamus--
ms.
judith
resnik
--that
is
directly
--
that
is
exactly
correct,
yes.
it
is
that
the
appeal
of
these
unappealing
groups
is
because
the
final
judgment
rule
says
even
if
there
is
an
error
and
even
if
it's
a
very
important
error,
absent
this
very
narrow
category
of
cases
that
are
final
through
our
gloss
on
cohen,
the
basic
plan
is
you
wait
till
the
end.
in
this
instance,
this
district
judge,
in
the
related
case,
certified
under
1292(b),
the
rico
question
that
came
back
--
came
up
to
this
court,
it
also
had
a
23(f)
appeal
in
this
case.
so
this
is
actually
a
textbook
case,
if
you
will,
of
watching
both
the
pros
and
cons
of
interlocutory
appellate
review,
and,
in
this
instance,
what
we
see
is
that
the
district
court,
here,
said
this
is
too
run-of-the-mill
for
1292(b).
however,
if
you
want,
cooperating
with
the
lawyers,
i
will
--
i
will
put
everything
in
abeyance,
if
you
want
to
seek
mandamus.
and
so
the
district
judge
was
attentive
to
the
lawyers'
concerns,
moreover
because
the
district
judge
has
put
a
protective
order
on
related
materials.
we
have
an
example
of
a
district
judge,
who
is
very
aware
of
the
parameters
of
the
litigation,
and
that
goes
to
remedies.
we
dont'
know--
ms.
judith
resnik
--in
--
the
--
underlying
the
privilege
is
the
workings
of
the
system
for
both
private
ordering
and
for
the
justice
system.
the
rare
instances
in
which
a
trial
judge
affirmatively
makes
a
finding
of
waiver
through
conduct,
in
this
instance
or
in
some
other
way,
are
going
to
not
undermine
the
privilege
in
its
initial
formation,
and
the
final
judgment
rule
has
said,
repeatedly,
we
could
get
it
wrong
on
class
action
certification.
we
could
get
it
wrong
on
attorney
disqualification.
nevertheless,
the
costs
of
the
final
judgment
rule
are
so
substantial--
ms.
judith
resnik
--i
appreciate
--
and
before
you
on
amici,
on
both
sides,
are
people
deeply
committed
to
the
administration
of
justice.
ms.
judith
resnik
and
i
believe
that
the
judges
and
lawyers
and
law
professors,
who
have
written
to
you
on
the
other
side,
are
committed
to
understanding
that
the
privilege
is
important
instrumentally.
the
trial--
ms.
judith
resnik
--there
are
many
provisions
short
of
going
to
jail,
and,
furthermore,
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
--
to
the
rule,
the
limited--
ms.
judith
resnik
--yes.
it
is.
ms.
judith
resnik
and
the
--
the
underlying
insight
of
cohen,
is
that
there
are
many
instances
when
dramatic
events
occur
in
the
dynamics
of
trial,
but
the
congress
has
concluded
that
the
final
judgment
rule
requires
waiting
till
you
get
to
the
end.
and
in
the
instances
--
contempt,
as
standing
here
as
an
alternative
around
that
rule,
as
is
mandamus,
as
is
1292(b),
are
small
windows,
not
for
the
regular
course
of
events.
the
empiric
suggests
that,
by
and
large,
people
are
getting
it
right,
but
there
will
a
lot
of
requests
for
review
and
the
strategic
dimension,
which
is
what
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
the
class
action
holdings
in
cohen
are
about,
will
invite
more
of
the
strategic
play,
so
that,
in
the
plea
from
the
judges
who
also
participated
in
the
amicus--
ms.
judith
resnik
--these
are
packages
that
--
yes,
the
attorney-client
privilege
--
and
this
is
granular
work
by
district
and
magistrate
judges
of
--
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pieces
of
paper.
it
could
go,
piecemeal,
to
the
court
of
appeals
more
than
one
time
and
it
can
also
come
up,
even
at
trial,
interrupting
a
trial.
so
we
could
watch
the
sequence
of
a
frequent,
repetitious
return
back
and
forth
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
kind
of
privilege
and,
potentially,
on
other
kinds
of
privileges.
thank
you
very
much.
