mr.
randall
l.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
well
over
a
century
this
court
has
recognized
the
importance
of
the
attorney-client
privilege.
in
hunt
v.
blackburn
in
1888,
the
court
clearly
stated
that
the
seal
of
secrecy
upon
communications
between
client
and
attorney
is
founded
upon
the
necessity,
in
the
interest
of
justice,
that
the
aid
and
advice
of
persons
having
knowledge
and
skill
in
the
practice
of
law
provide
that
advice
in
a
manner
that
is
safely
and
readily
available
and,
importantly,
free
from
the
consequences
or
apprehension
of
disclosure.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
justice
scalia,
there
are
--
there
are
several
answers
to
the
question.
let
me
start,
first,
with
the
--
the
issue
of
the
importance
of
--
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
as
a
key
and
central
element
of
the
administration
of
justice
that
this
court
has
recognized,
not
just
with
hunt,
but
in
a
number
of
cases
since.
but
the
question
i
think
also
goes
more
to
prong
three
of
cohen,
which
is
the
reviewability
standard.
in
the
context
of
attorney-client
privileged
information,
once
that
information
is
disclosed
to
your
adversary,
it
is
disclosed
to
the
last
person
on
earth
you
might
want
to
see
it.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
well--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--i
think
with
trade
secrets--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--your
honor,
we
do
not
argue
that
--
here,
that
there
should
be
an
interlocutory
appeal
for
trade
secrets.
i
think
the
practical
resolution
to
the
trade
secret
question
is
present
in
most
cases
of
commercial
litigation,
where
the
court
would
provide
a
protective
order
limiting
access
to
the
trade
secret;
in
other
words,
limiting
access
to
counsel.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
but,
with
regard
to
the
attorney-client
privilege,
first
on
the
issue
of
the
protective
order,
the
protective
order
cannot
limit
the
adversary's
counsel
from
seeing
the
information.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
think
that's
the
last
person
in
the
world
you
would
want
to
see.
you
could
limit
access
to
trade
secrets
to
counsel,
who
could
make
no
use
of
the
coca-cola
formula
or
--
or
colonel
sanders'
chicken
recipe,
but
--
but
the--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--but
--
but
the
answer
to
the
--
the
importance
question,
i
think,
has
to
return
to
the
central
and
important
role
that
the
privilege
plays
in
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
it
--
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
at
least
in
part,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
your
honor,
i
--
don't
think
we
are
here
to
suggest
that
it
would
stop
people
from
talking
to
their
lawyers.
i
think
the
point
is
that
the
incremental
erosion
of
the
rule
is
going
to
lessen
the
value
of
the
privilege.
at
this--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
suggest
that
--
that
erroneous
orders
on
privilege
are
occurring
routinely.
certainly,
we
have
suggested
they
occurred
in
this
case
and
that
they
happened
in
other
cases.
but
i
think
the
more
direct
answer
to
your
question
goes
to
the
court's
holding
in
upjohn.
one
of
the
things
that
upjohn
points
out
is
that
what
is
necessary
--
and
i
think
the
court
makes
a
similar
observation
in
swidler
&
berlin,
that
one
of
the
things
that's
necessary
for
the
privilege
to
have
effect
is
predictability.
if
--
if
there
is
no
predictability,
then
you
fall
back
to
the
apprehension
or
the
worry
of
disclosure
that
is
observed
in
hunt.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
your
honor,
i
don't
disagree
that
--
that
the
rule
we
search
for
will
not
still
have
problems
with
the
protection
of
the
attorney-client
privilege,
but
i
do
disagree
that
it
will
not
significantly
improve
the
quality
of
the
rules
that
counsel
are
--
are
designed
--
or
counsel
are
--
are
instructed
to
follow.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
believe
that
you
do.
i
used
the
term
"interlocutory"
only
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
appeal
would
take
place
while
the
case-in-chief
proceeds.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
i
don't
think
1292
would
--
would
obtain,
in
this
instance,
and
i
think
the
--
the
judge
in
the
district
court
made
this
observation
himself,
although
he
did
not
expound
on
his
reasoning.
it
would
appear
that
the
reasoning
would
be
that
this
--
that
a
decision
in
this
case
is
not
likely
to
materially
advance
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
litigation,
so,
therefore,
i
think
1292(b)
would
not
be
applicable
in
the
ordinary
case
to
a
--
to
a
ruling
finding
waiver
of
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
no,
your
honor,
you
have
not.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
the
issue
of
those
other
privileges
has,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
come
before
this
court.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
i
don't
believe
you
do,
your
honor,
and
let
me
say,
first
of
all,
the
--
the
instance
that
your
honor
points
to,
where
the
information
would
be
disclosed
to
the
other
party,
it's
not
the
other
party
in
this
instance,
that--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--that
you
are
worried
about
in
first
instance.
it
is,
in
fact,
the
counsel.
and
--
and,
second
of
all,
i
think
the
importance
criteria
as
--
as
previously
defined
in
this
court's
cases,
is
a
measure
of
the
importance
of
the
interest
that
will
be
lost
if
appeal
is
not
available
now.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
your
honor,
that
--
i
apologize.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
that
is
the
analysis
that
the
eleventh
circuit
applied,
and
i
think
it
was
incorrect
for
the
following
reasons:
first
of
all,
it
treats
the
attorney-client
privilege
as
if
it
is
a
use
privilege,
as
you
describe
it
in
your
questioning.
it
is
not
a
use
privilege.
it's
a
right
to
be
free
from
compelled
disclosure.
so
returning
to
--
to
trial
is
not
going
to
undisclose
the
information
that's
already--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--that's--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
the
attorney-client
privilege
cases,
this
court
did
not
find
that
collateral
order
jurisdiction
did
not
obtain
because
of
the
fact
that
the
attorney-client
privilege
or
the
attorney-client
--
excuse
me
--
disqualification
cases
were
not
important.
the
court's
ruling
was
premised
upon
the
fact
that
that
order
was
sufficiently
reviewable
under
prong
three
of
cohen.
so
it's
not
--
the
decisions
were
not
based
on
cohen--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--justice
sotomayor,
the
--
the
importance
in
this
instance
is
--
is
measured
against
the
societal
importance
or
the
societal
need
for
non-piecemeal
application
of
the
final
judgment
rule.
so
when
you
measure
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
the
role
that
it
plays
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
ensuring
observance
with
laws
against
a
rule
of
efficiency,
in
this
instance
in
our
view,
the
attorney-client
privilege
weighs
heavier
in
that
consideration.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
i
understand
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
in
this
instance,
the
facts
that
the
court
would
need
to
consider
are
sufficiently
narrow
that
it
should
not
trouble
the
final
judgment
rule
and
sufficiently
collateral--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--i
agree,
justice
ginsburg
that
that
was
the
kind
of
narrow
issue
that
was
at
issue
in
--
in
cohen
v.
beneficial
industrial.
but
this
court
has
considered
much
more
factually
intensive
cases
in
the
context
of
qualified
immunity
or
maybe
as
a
better
example,
the
context
of
the
double
jeopardy
claim
such
as
in
abney.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
my
only
point
is
that
the
appellate
courts
are
perfectly
capable
and
able
to
consider
the
facts
that
are
at
issue
in
those
cases,
and
it
does
not
unduly
burden
the
appellate
process
in
the
context
of
those
type
of
cases.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
no,
your
honor,
the
--
the
party
losing
the
claim
would
not
have
the
same
right
to
appeal.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
i
think
access
to
information
in
the
course
of
discovery
does
not
trigger
the
same
important
interest
that
orders
compelling
discovery
of
attorney-client
would
trigger?
so
i
don't
think
that
they
would
in
any
way
satisfy
that
test.
and
i
think,
in
fact,
the
question
presented
as
designed
even
by
respondent
does
not
capture
orders
that
deny
the
disclosure
of
attorney-client
privilege
information.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
focus
on
the
role
that
the
privilege
plays
in
the
administration
of
justice,
and
it's
why
i
went,
in
response
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
why
i
went
to
the
balancing
between
the
interest
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
versus
the
interest
of
a
more
rigorous
application
of
the
final
judgment
rule.
so
--
so,
while
i
think
it
is
instructive
to
compare
the
privilege
to
other
privileges
that
the
court
may
in
the
future
confront,
i
think
the
proper
analysis
is
to
balance
that,
that
rigorous
application
of
the
final
judgment
rule,
to
the
attorney-client
privilege.
and
i
think
in
that
instance
it
resolves
more
quickly.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
that
the
attorney
would
be
obligated
to
take
the
appeal.
and
i
believe
that
the
--
that
the
facts
that
we've
laid
out
in
our
brief
with
regard
to
what
has
actually
occurred
--
we
wonder
how
many
appeals
might
take
place.
we
know
how
many
appeals
might
take
place,
because
we
have
the
experience
in
the
third
and
the
ninth
and
the
d.c.
circuits
that
tell
us
that
in
the
11
years
since
ford
was
decided
by
judge
becker
in
the
third
circuit,
the
opinion
by
judge
becker
in
the
third
circuit,
that
there
have
been
only
11
such
cases
brought
up
on
appeal.
so,
we
have
some
experience
to
tell
us
what
will
actually
happen.
but
i
don't
believe
it
requires
that
the
attorney
as
a
matter
of
obligation
take
that
appeal.
the
court,
i
believe,
dealt
with
this
same
issue
in
the
behrens
v.
pelletier
case,
which
is
a
qualified
immunity
case,
where
the
court
wondered
whether
or
not
there
were
going
to
be
an
increase,
a
significant
increase
in
the
--
the
appeals
that
arose
out
of
--
out
of
the
court's
holding.
and
the
court
observed
that
the
only
conclusion
that
could
be
reached
--
and
i
believe
the
court
quoted
in
that
opinion
the
opinion
of
judge
easterbrook
in
the
able
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
--
that
the
only
conclusion
that
could
be
drawn
is
that
there
was
forebearance
by
the
lawyers
in
taking
appeals
that
they
otherwise
had
the
opportunity
to
take.
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
conclude
that
there
would
be
a
difference
in
the
analysis
in
--
in
the
case
here.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
correct,
your
honor.
we
have
asked
that
the
court
address,
in
this
instance,
the
question
presented
having
to
do
with
only
waiver
cases.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
your
honor--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--i
think
it's
certainly
--
it
certainly
should
be
assumed
that
if
this
court
rules
in
our
favor,
it
must
conclude
that
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
important.
if
it
concludes
that
the--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--i
--
i
agree.
but
--
but
in
order
to
get
to
--
to
the
position
we
advocate,
the
court
must
pass
that
threshold
and
establish
importance.
if
the
court
reaches
that
conclusion
it
is
certainly
likely
that
the
importance
test
in
other
existence-of
privilege
cases,
for
example,
would
obtain.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
compels
the
conclusion
that
any
case
addressing
privilege
must
therefore
be
permitted
collateral
order
jurisdiction.
for
example,
i
believe
you
recited
the
crime
fraud
exception
in
your
question.
certainly
crime
fraud
exception
might
present
a
difficulty
with
prong
two
of
the
cohen
analysis,
which
has
to
do
with
the
separability
of
the
issue
on
appeal
for
merit.
so
it
may
well
be
that
in
crime
fraud
cases
there
is
not
sufficient
separability
of
the
issue
from
the
merits
and
therefore
collateral
order
jurisdiction
would
not
obtain.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
i
think
we
are
in
agreement
that
orders
that
deny
the
disclosure
of
information
would
not
be
immediately
appealable.
so
there
are
--
there
are
a
number
of
instances
that
this
court
might
find
in
what
i'll
call
general
privilege
cases
that
might
not
obtain,
and
it's
the
course
that
the
court
has
taken
in
other
sort
of
general
areas
of
law.
for
example,
in
the
attorney
disqualification
cases,
the
court
started
off
in
firestone
finding
that
orders
denying
disqualification
did
not
satisfy
collateral
order
jurisdiction
and
it
limited
its
holdings
to
--
to
that
instance.
in
flanagan
it
took
up
the
question
of
whether
or
not
collateral
order
jurisdiction
obtained
in
disqualification
cases
and
criminal
cases,
and
in
richardson-merrell
in
civil
cases.
so
the
court
has
traditionally
taken,
if
you
will,
the
facts
of
the
case
presented
to
them
and
limited
its
rulings
to
the
facts
of
those
cases.
we
suggest
that
approach
in
this
case.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
other
than
the
examples
that
i
--
that
i
just
gave,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
principled
difference
between
the
finding
of
importance,
and
that
is
--
that
is
clearly
a
threshold
issue.
as
court
said
in
will,
it's
the
--
the
--
what
the
issues
ultimately
boil
down
to.
so
with
regard
to
that
issue
i
--
i
agree,
but
with
regard
to
crime
fraud
exception
or
instances
when
no
disclosure
is
ordered,
another
example
that
i
think
the
respondent
points
to
in
their
brief
is
instances
of
inadvertent
disclosure.
instances
of
inadvertent
disclosure
would
not
trigger
the
--
the
prejudice
element
necessary
because
the
--
if
you
will,
the
cat
is
in
fact
already
out
of
the
bag
at
that
point.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
no,
your
honor--
mr.
randall
l.
allen
--we
do
not
extend
the
--
the
rule
that
we
advocate
to
work
product
in
the
--
in
the
broad
sense.
certainly
there
are
exceptions
within
rule
26
to
when
work
product
can
in
fact
under
the
right
circumstances
be
disclosed.
so
we
are
not
embracing
the
--
the
work
product
as
a
general
rule.
certainly
the
mental
impressions
of
client
--
of
counsel,
which
is
the
important
exclusion
of
the
work
product
doctrine
in
rule
26,
we
would
embrace
as
a
--
as
an
appropriate
limitation
on
the
rule
that
we
are
advocating.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
randall
l.
allen
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
that
justice
alito
raised
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
an
appeal
of
a
collateral
issue
dealing
with
waiver
or
privilege
would
stay
the
litigation.
the
answer
is
it
does
not.
the
case
remains
with
the
district
court,
the
district
court
is
empowered
to
manage
the
case.
only
the
question
addressing
the
issue
would
go
up
with
collateral
order
jurisdiction.
indeed,
in
this
case,
the
court
did
not
stay
the
litigation
below.
so,
the
court
maintains
that
ability
to
manage
its
own
docket.
to
be
sure--
mr.
randall
l.

--he
has
not
gone
ahead
with
the
trial.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
he
is
certainly
empowered
to
do
so.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
your
honor,
the
scenario
that
you
raise
would
put
the
attorney
or
the
client,
depending
on
who
is
in
the
box,
if
you
will,
to
some
hard
choices.
but
there
are
two
ways
that
the
case
stays:
either
the
district
court
has
to
order
that
the
case
stays
or
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
order
that
the
case
stays.
the
parties
and
their
counsel
cannot
stay
the
case.
so,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
could
be
a
difficult
situation
for
the
parties.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
i
am
unaware
that
it
has
--
it
has
ever
happened,
your
honor,
and
i
hope
it
doesn't.
but
the
--
but
point
is
that
the
district
court
maintains
that
power
and
authority
to
run
--
to
run
its
courtroom.
the
united
states
cites
will
for
the
proposition
that
--
that
the
collateral
order
doctrine
is
designed
to
impact
some
particular
value
of
high
order,
and
it
recites
from
will
a
number
of
those
particular
values
of
high
order,
including
qualified
immunity.
as
this
court
recognized
in
--
in
harlow,
a
--
a
doctrine
of
common
law
origin,
much
like
the
attorney-client
privilege,
the
--
the
doctrine
in
harlow,
qualified
immunity
is
designed
to
impact
and
affect
the
efficient
operation
of
government.
the
design
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
intended
to
have
the
same
impact
on
the
efficient
and
effective
operation
of
the
administration
of
justice.
if
i
could
go
back,
justice
breyer,
to
the
question
that
you
raised
with
regard
to
other
privilege.
i
would
suggest
that
a
holding
in
this
case
in
our
favor
would
have
no
impact
on
the
court's
later
determination
of
privileges
of
husband,
wife,
spousal
privileges,
or
of
priest
and
penitent
type
privileges.
i
would
suggest
that
the
better
course
would
be
to
examine
a
case
that
develops
the
importance
or
the
impact
of
those
privileges,
but
certainly
with
regard,
for
example,
to
spousal
immunity
or
spousal
privilege,
the
way
that
the
states
recognize
them
--
i
believe
that
all
50
states
recognize
spousal
privilege
--
is
varied.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
your
honor,
i
do
not
have
any
empirical
information
to
answer
that
question.
but
to
go
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
the
underlying
premise
of
whether
or
not
those
other
cases
might
generate
some
flood
gate,
if
you
will,
i
think
we
have
--
we
have
answered
to
be
clear
with
respondent's
description
of
our
counting.
i
don't
think
it
is
a
statistical
analysis.
we
simply
counted
the
actual
appeals,
11.
mr.
randall
l.
allen
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
should
count
against
us.
