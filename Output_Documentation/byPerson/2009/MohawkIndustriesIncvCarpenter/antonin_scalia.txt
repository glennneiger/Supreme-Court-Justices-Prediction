scalia
mr.
allen,
except
for
the
fact
that
you
and
i
are
lawyers,
do
you
really
think
that
the
--
that
confidentiality
right
is
any
more
important
to
the
proper
functioning
of
society
than,
let's
say,
the
protection
of
trade
secrets?
so
that
in
a
case
of
discovery
where
the
defendant
says,
if
i
produce
this
i
would
be
giving
up
a
trade
secret
and
it's
not
necessary
for
the
case,
and
the
judge
says
no,
turn
it
over
--
would
there
be
in
your
view
a
right
to
interlocutory
appeal
in
that
case?
and
if
not
there,
then
why
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
thing
with
a
trade
secret.
it
is
a
suit
between
another
company
who
is
a
competitor
of
yours--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
judge
says,
turn
over
your
trade
secret,
the
formula
for
cocoa-cola,
and
you
say
no.
no
interlocutory
appeal,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
do
you
say
there
should
be
an
interlocutory
appeal
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
let's
talk
about
predictability.
once
you
make
an
exception
for
waiver,
there
is
already
that
limitation.
it's
not
absolute.
maybe
it
can
be
waived.
secondly,
you
have
to
worry
about
a
district
court
finding
it
to
have
been
waived,
even
though
it
really
wasn't.
that's
another
point
of
doubt.
and,
thirdly,
you
have
to
worry
about
the
supreme
court
affirming
a
district
court
that
wrongly
found
it
to
have
been
waived
because
we
give,
you
know,
weight
to
the
fact-finding
of
the
--
of
the
district
court.
once
you
--
once
you
factor
in
all
of
those
uncertainties,
you
are
not
talking
about
a
--
you
know,
about
a
fail-safe
privilege
at
all.
there
are
those
doubts,
and
i'm
not
sure
the
doubts
are
increased
enormously,
by
simply
saying
a
district
court
may
make
a
mistake
without
--
without
your
being
able
to
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
mistake.
