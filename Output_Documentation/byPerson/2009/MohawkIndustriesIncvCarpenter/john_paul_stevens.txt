justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
two
yes
or
no
questions?
one,
did
you,
in
fact,
ask
for
a
1292(b)
right
to
appeal,
make
an
interlocutory
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
second
question
is,
would
your
rule
apply
if
the
decision
had
gone
the
other
way?
if
they
had
denied
access
to
the
documents,
would
the
other
--
would
the
person
seeking
discovery
have
the
same
right
to
appeal
that
you
asked
for
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
attorney-client
claim
sometimes
raised,
along
with
a
host
of
other
discovery
issues,
as
a
bargaining
chip?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
go
ahead
with
the
trial,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
never
would,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
go
ahead
with
trial
while
a
material
issue
is
still
pending,
i
can't
imagine
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can't
imagine
a
judge
going
to
trial
in
a
case
when
an
important
issue
like
this
is
pending
on
appeal.
has
that
ever
happened?
