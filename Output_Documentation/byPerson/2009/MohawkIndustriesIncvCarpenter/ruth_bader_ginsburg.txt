mr.
allen,
you
used
a
term
before,
and
i
think
you
were
right
in
using
it
--
you
said,
v.
beneficial
is
a
narrow
exception
and
it
--
the
theory
is,
it
is
a
final
judgment.
it's
not
interlocutory.
and,
nowadays,
the
courts
have
1292(b).
they
can
certify
a
question,
if
they
think
it's
sufficiently
important
and
they
need
an
answer,
without
pretending
that
it's
a
final
judgment
in
the
case.
so,
given
1292(b),
shouldn't
we
be
particularly
reluctant
to
extend
cohen
v.
beneficial
to
include
a
case
of
a
privilege
that
maybe
was
wrongfully
denied?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
1292(b)
was
meant
to
deal
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
rule
of
efficiency.
it's
a
firm
final
judgment
rule
that
we
have
in
the
federal
system.
and
we
are
talking
about
a
narrow
exception.
the
exception
was
first
declared
in
cohen
v.
beneficial.
the
question
there
was
security
for
costs,
yes
or
no?
does
that
--
that
is
a
pure
question
of
law.
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
variety
of
factual
circumstances.
attorney-client
is
quite
different
because
it
can
often
be
fact-bound.
it
depends
upon
this
particular
case.
cohen
v.
beneficial
was
meant
for
the
kind
of
question
that
doesn't
get
you
into
the
facts.
otherwise,
once
you
get
into
--
once
it's
a
fact-bound
question,
you
are
really
eroding
the
final
judgment
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
carving
out
an
area,
attorney-client
privilege,
as
opposed
to
the
kind
of
situation
cohen
v.
beneficial
dealt
with.
here's
a
rule
that
a
state
has.
you
have
to
put
up
security
for
costs
before
you
go
ahead
with
a
class
action.
the
answer
to
that
is
either
yes
or
no,
that
it
either
requires
it
or
it
doesn't
require
it.
no
facts
at
all.
you
just
have
a
class
action,
you
need
security
for
costs.
maybe
this
particular
case
doesn't
involve
many
facts,
but
there
will
be
attorney-client
privileges
cases,
waiver
cases
that
surely
do.
so
we
can't
take
that
category,
attorney-client
privilege,
and
equate
it
to
what
was
the
kind
of
question
at
issue
in
cohen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
those
are
cases
that
say
your
right
is
not
to
be
tried,
your
right
is
not
to
be
exposed
to
trial
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
allen,
one
of
the
purposes,
one
of
the
--
the
underpinnings
of
cohen
v.
beneficial
is
that
this
kind
of
question
is
not
going
to
come
up
very
often,
but
attorney-client
privilege,
once
you
say
that
that's
open
to
--
everything
stops
while
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
get
that.
and
if
you
--
and
if
we
hold
the
way
you
want
us
to,
then
a
lawyer
will
be
obligated
every
time
she
thinks
that
she
has
a
valid
claim
to
the
privilege
or
that
it
hasn't
been
waived,
she
would
be
obligated
to
take
an
appeal
which
you
are
urging
would
be
an
appeal
of
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
sensible
line
between
an
invocation
of
the
privilege,
denied,
and
a
holding
that
the
privilege
has
been
waived?
i
know
in
your
reply
brief
you
--
you
draw
some
kind
of
a
distinction
between
waiver
of
the
privilege
and
the
existence
of
the
privilege.
i
didn't
follow
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
another.
you
are
stressing
the
importance
of
the
attorney-client
relationship,
the
work
of
the
attorney.
do
you
extend
your
position
to
work
product?
it's
not
privileged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
certainly
--
it's
certainly
protected
against
disclosure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
allen
has
told
us
that
there
are
very
few
cases,
in
fact
11
cases
in
i
don't
know
how
many
years,
in
the
third
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
you
suggesting
that
--
that
cohen
itself
wouldn't
come
out
the
same
way
today
if
the
question
of
security
for
costs,
whether
state
or
federal,
hadn't
been
settled?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is
only
in
egregious
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
--
how
is
it
--
unless
the
judge
cooperates,
it
has
to
be
criminal
contempt.
it
wouldn't
be
civil
contempt.
the
judge
says,
i'm
not
going
to
hold
you,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
mandamus
is
supposed
--
not
supposed
to
be
a
run
about
the
final
judgment
rule,
and
if
--
and
if
cohen
v.
beneficial
is
available,
then
mandamus
would
not
lie,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
could
--
you
could
seek
an
interlocutory
appeal
under
1292(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
i
think
i
have
this
right,
but
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
i
thought
in
cohen
v.
beneficial,
it
wasn't
just
a
question
that
we
would
like
to
get
this
legal
question
settled,
but,
in
fact,
for
many
plaintiffs
if
security
for
costs
was
something
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
put
up
up
front,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
lawsuit.
it
would
be
the
practical
end
of
the
lawsuit.
unlike
in
an
attorney-client
privilege,
the
suit
goes
on.
so
cohen
v.
beneficial
wasn't
simply
that
this
was
an
important
question
unsettled
under
erie,
it
was
the
practical
reality
that
plaintiffs
who
had
to
put
up
security
costs
would
be
out
of--
