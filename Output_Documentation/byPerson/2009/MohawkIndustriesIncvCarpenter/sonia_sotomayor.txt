justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
if
the
court
doesn't,
as
justice
scalia
has
posited?
the
court
here
could
do
the
same
thing,
depending
on
the
secret
being
disclosed.
it
could
set
up
any
number
of
protective
mechanisms.
the
issue
is
broader
than
that,
which
is:
why
is
the
public
policy
of
anti-disclosure
any
more
important
in
the
attorney-client
privilege
than
in
the
trade
secret
context?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
ah.
are
you
sure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
the
role
--
the
central
role
--
role,
is
to
encourage
the
frank
and
open
communication
between
client
and
attorney?
that's
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
if
that
is
the
purpose,
the
very
existence
of
exceptions
infringes
that
purpose.
the
minute
you
create
an
exception,
you
are
placing
some
sort
of
limitation
to
the
frank
and
open
discussion
that
you
are
permitting,
so
the
damage
is
already
done.
the
further
disclosure
doesn't
really
serve
the
purpose
--
or
help
the
purpose
in
any
meaningful
way.
the
fact
that
an
erroneous
decision
on
attorney-client
disclosure
is
not
going
to
stop
people
from
talking
to
lawyers
if
they
really
need
to
and
they
are
staying
within
the
rules.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well
--
but
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out,
because
you
are
positing
that
erroneous
decisions
on
disclosures
are
being
made
routinely
by
the
lower
courts.
assuming,
as
i
do,
that
there
are
some
erroneous
disclosures,
but
that
that's
not
necessarily
the
majority,
why
is
there
an
incremental
erosion
significant
enough
to
overcome
our
interests
in
the
finality
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
the
use
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
if
i
cut
you
off.
but
what
is
the
use
by
the
adversary
lawyer
that
you
are
worried
about?
that
the
lawyer
is
going
to
use
the
information
against
your
client,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
is
a
remedy.
after
final
judgment,
if
the
information
was
disclosed
erroneously,
the
court
sets
aside
the
judgment,
sends
it
back,
and
says,
you
can't
use
it
in
the
future
and
so
make
your
case
without
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
that
an
effective
remedy
for
the
harm
that
you
are
claiming
exists
in
the
disclosure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
to
a
right
to
choose
your
lawyer
and
not
to
be
--
and
not
to
be
represented
by
a
--
by
a
different
lawyer,
and
yet
we
don't
permit
that
to
be
interlocutorily
appealed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
is
this
any
greater
in
terms
of
the
harm
that
your
client
suffers?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understand
what
the
court
below
did.
i'm
just
following
up
on
your
point
about
the
importance
of
this
privilege
and
why
it's
critical
that
it
be
subject
to
interlocutory
appeal
as
opposed
to
the
final
judgment
ruling.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
--
just
so
i'm
clear
about
your
position,
are
you
arguing
that
all
issues
related
to
attorney-client,
whether
they
are
waiver,
crime
or
fraud,
scope
of
the
privilege,
et
cetera,
that
all
issues
are
immediately
appealable
because
the
public
interest
is
the
same
in
all
cases
related
to
the
attorney-client
privilege,
or
are
you
wanting
us
to
limit
this
rule
only
to
the
waiver
cases?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
but
your
position
logically
would
apply
to
everything,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
otherwise,
how
do
we
distinguish
or
make
a
difference
in
your
analysis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
one
is
doubting
its
importance.
the
issue
is
whether
or
that
importance
outweighs
the
finality
rule.
that's
a
very
different
thing
for
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
in
the
third
circuit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
ms.
resnick,
can
you
go
back
and
articulate
what
you
see
as
the
rule
that
we
have
on
what
is
important
enough?
because
that
is
what
really
is
at
question.
so
how
would
you
articulate
a
rule
that
would
apply
both
to
the
cases
in
which
we
have
granted
interlocutory
appeal
and
to
those
that
you
are
advocating
we
don't.
because
it's
not
just
freedom
from
suits
like
qualified
immunity
or
double
jeopardy.
we
have
granted
interlocutory
appeal
in
other
areas,
including
in
the
cohen
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
only
going
to
jail
that
gives
you
criminal
intent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
immediately
appealable.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
section
1291
of
the
judicial
code
confers
on
federal
courts
of
appeals
jurisdiction
to
review
final
decisions
of
the
district
courts.
although
the
final
decisions
typically
are
ones
that
trigger
the
entry
of
judgment,
we
have
recognized
that
they
also
include
a
small
class
of
prejudgment
orders
that
resolve
important
questions
collateral
to
the
merits
of
an
action
and
are
effectively
unreviewable
on
appeal
from
final
judgment.
in
this
case,
petitioner
mohawk
industries
attempted
to
bring
a
collateral
order
appeal
after
the
district
court
ordered
it
to
disclose
certain
confidential
information
on
the
ground
that
mohawk
had
waived
its
attorney-client
privilege.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
mohawk's
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
disclosure
orders
adverse
to
the
attorney-client
privilege
qualify
for
immediate
appeal
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
we
hold
that
they
do
not.
we
readily
acknowledge
the
importance
of
the
attorney-client
privilege.
by
assuring
confidentiality
the
privilege
encourages
full
and
frank
communications
between
clients
and
counsel
which
in
turn
promotes
a
well
functioning
adversarial
system.
the
crucial
question,
however,
is
not
whether
the
privilege
is
important
in
the
abstract.
it
is
whether
deferring
appellate
review
until
final
judgment
so
imperils
the
vitality
of
the
privilege
as
to
justify
the
cost
of
allowing
immediate
appeal
of
all
adverse,
privilege
rulings.
in
our
estimation,
traditional
post-judgment
appeals
generally
suffice
to
protect
the
right
of
litigants
and
to
assure
adequate
incentives
for
candid
attorney-client
consultation.
moreover
when
litigants
are
confronted
with
particularly
novel
or
injurious
privilege
rulings,
they
have
several
potential
avenues
of
immediate
review
apart
from
collateral
order
appeal,
including
interlocutory
appeal,
pursuant
to
section
1292
(b),
a
mandamus.
in
short,
the
benefits
of
extending
the
collateral
order
doctrine
to
attorney-client
privilege
rulings
are
likely
to
be
minimal
while
the
cost
might
well
be
significant.
authorizing
litigants
to
pursue
successive
piecemeal
appeals
of
all
such
rulings
which
disrupt
the
orderly
progress
of
ongoing
litigation
and
needlessly
burden
the
court
of
appeals.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
thomas
concurs
in
part
and
concurs
in
the
judgment.
