mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
last
15
years,
this
court,
in
applying
the
principles
of
cohen,
has
repeatedly
stressed
that
a
necessary
requirement
is
that
the
order
involved
and
the
issues
implicated
be
important
and,
particularly,
that
the
issues
be
so
important
as
to
outweigh
the
values
served
by
the
important
and
usual
rule
of
a
final
judgment
requirement.
in
our
view,
the
denial
of
an
assertion
of
attorney-client
privilege
in
an
individual
case
does
not
rise
to
that
level
and
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
we
do
not
--
we
--
to
be
clear,
we
are
not
asserting
that
an
--
that
an
assertion
of
attorney-client
privilege
by
the
government
is
--
is
immediately--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--let
me
also
stress,
we
are
not
arguing
that
a
denial
of
the
assertion
of
the
deliberative
process
privilege
is
immediately
appealable.
our
--
the
--
the
submission
that
we
make
in
the
latter
part
of
our
brief,
and
that
we
urge
the
court
not
to
foreclose
here,
is
the
presidential
communications
privilege,
which
applies
to
communications
involving
the
president
or
his
top
advisors.
and
we
also
say
that
the
state
secrets
privilege
raises
similar
concerns.
both
of
those
serve
functions
of
constitutional
significance.
we
do
not
make
the
same
claim
about
--
about
the
general
government
privilege
for
deliberative
process.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
want
to
rule
out
the
possibility
that
there
could
be
a
statutory
privilege
of
some
--
of
some
particular
sort--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
--
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
available
in
an
appropriate
case.
there
are
the
--
there
are
the
limitations.
we
trust
that
a
court
would
--
would
grant
that,
but
these
--
these
are
interests
of
the
highest
order.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
not
--
we
don't
get
an
interlocutory
appeal
under
--
under
1291.
we
are
not
arguing
for
that
--
for
that
position.
and,
for
the
two
particular
privileges
that
--
that
we
have
identified
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
it
is
possible
that
1292(b)
certification
would
be
granted
by
the
--
by
the
court,
but
it
is
also
possible
that
it
would
not.
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
i
would
like
to
identify
--
and
i
think
justice
sotomayor
asked
about
--
about
a
test
for
importance,
and
the
court,
in
its
recent
decision
in
will,
tried
to
summarize
what
--
what
it
has
been
driving
at
over
the
last
15
years
on
this
importance
prong
and
whether
the
importance
outweighs
the
--
the
final
judgment
values.
and
what
the
court
said
there
is
that
there
has
--
that
the
denial
of
an
immediate
appeal
has
to
undermine
--
let
me
--
let
me
quote
--
"has
to
undermine
some
particular
value
of
high
order.
"
and
then
the
court
identified
the
things
that
have
fallen
into
that
category.
it
mentioned
separation
of
powers.
the
court
mentioned
disruption
of
government
operations
through
the
denial
of
qualified
immunity,
and
i
would
add
the
denial
of
statutory
immunity
under
the
westfall
act
to
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
--
i
think
the
--
i
do
not.
and
i
think
the
problem
is
that
the
denial
of
attorney-client
privilege
is
tied
up
with
discovery
of
the
sort
that
happens
every
day
in
federal
court.
it's
bound
up
with
--
with
discovery
plans,
that
--
objections
on
relevance,
materiality,
various
--
various
privileges.
one
of
the
important
values
served
by
the
final
judgment
rule
is
that
the
conduct
of
--
of
district
court
proceedings
like
that
is
committed
to
the
judgment
and
discretion
of
the
district
court,
and
if
a
disappointed
litigant
could
automatically
run
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
undermines
the
ability
of
the
district
court
judge
to
manage
the
day-to-day--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
the
more
precise
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
whether
the
--
the
question
is
whether
the
denial
of
an
attorney-client
privilege
threatens
to
--
so
substantially
undermine
the
values
of
the
privilege
to
warrant
an
immediate
appeal,
and
i
think,
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
several
of
the
justices
here,
there
are
--
there
are
exceptions
to
the
privilege,
which
--
which
will
--
might
undermine
the
confidence
people
might
have
in
it.
there
are
uncertainties
at
trial.
these
are
often
fact-based
determinations
that
would
be
subject
to
clearly
erroneous
review
on
appeal.
the
very
sorts
of
reasons
why
issues
like
this
are
committed
to
the
district
court's
discretion
and
reviewed
on
final
judgment
when
you
can
find
out
whether
the
error
actually
made
a
difference
on
a
particular
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's
not
entirely
meaningless.
it
can
--
if
the
evidence
was
used
in
the
trial
and
had
--
had
a
substantial
impact
you
can
have
a
reversal
of
the
judgment,
and
--
and
the
--
the
injury
can
be
mitigated
by
saying
that
the
--
that
the
evidence
cannot
be
--
cannot
be
used
in
the
retrial.
that
is
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
again,
the
--
the
question
is
--
the
attorney/client
privilege
is
not
for
competence
in
its
own
right
but
to
encourage
frank
communications
in
order
to
promote
litigation
in
the
function
of
lawyers.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
denial
of
a
privilege
in
a
particular
case
will
so
undermine
that
privilege
as
a
general
matter
to
warrant
an
immediate
appeal.
and
we
think
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
and
also
the
loss
of
the
privilege
to
the
individual
litigant
we
think
is
not
a
sufficient
basis,
because
the
other
cases
that
i
mentioned,
and
that
the
court
identified
in
will
are
situations
where
the
injury
transcends
the
particular
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
--
that's
a
very
important
--
that's
a
very
important
point.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
are.
and
i
--
i
--
i
think
that
supports
the
point
for
not
having
immediate
appealable--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that's
the
nature
of
trial
proceedings
and
discovery.
judges
may
make
erroneous
rulings.
and
this
court,
again,
acknowledged
in
will
that
the
purpose
of
the
final
judgment
rule
is
no
to
protect
--
prevent
particular
injustices
that
might
happen
in
a
particular
case.
again,
to
go
back
to
what
the
court
has
stressed,
there
has
to
be
a
--
a
--
a
value,
and
the
court
said
constitutional
or
statutory
or
something
with
a
large
public
pedigree
where
the
--
where
the
injury
will
--
will
not
be
--
where
the
weighing
of
the
costs
and
benefits
comes
out
quite
differently.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
so
if
there
was
a
statute
that
just
codified
the
--
the
privileges
like
this.
what
i
--
what
i
--
what
i
was
suggesting
is
there
might
be
a
statute
that
would
identify
a
particular
governmental
interest
as
in
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
in
the
--
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
and
that's
a
--
district
judges
are
--
are
--
who
manage
these
cases
every
day
can
see
through
that,
and
--
and
--
and
can
be
trusted
to,
by
and
large,
make
correct
results.
it
may
be
that
there
will
be
an
occasional
erroneous
determination.
but,
again,
as
for
privileges
generally,
that's
--
that's
so.
i
did
want
to
make
one
final
point
about
--
about
irreparable
injury.
for
the
sorts
of
privileges
that
we
have
identified
in
--
in
our
brief,
the
--
the
presidential
communications
privilege
and
whatnot,
that
--
that
harm
is
immediate
and
broad
on
behalf
of
the
nation
as
a
whole.
that
is
a
different
question
from
the
harm
to
a
particular
litigant
when
a
privilege
is
denied
in
a
particular
case
and
it
doesn't
undermine
the
broader
purposes
of
the
privilege.
