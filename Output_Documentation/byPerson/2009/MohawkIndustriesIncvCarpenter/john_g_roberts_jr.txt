chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-678,
mohawk
industries
v.
carpenter.
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
some
time
ago
justice
breyer
asked
the
question
of
why
is
this
different
than
the
other
privileges,
and
i
would
like
your
answer
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
resnik.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
get
to
that,
i
think,
when
the
government
lawyer
gets
up.
but
does
that
distinction
make
sense
to
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
government
lawyers
get
the
privilege,
private
lawyers
don't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
are
talking
about
the
central
privilege
to
the
maintenance
of
the
adversary
system
which
we've
determined
to
be
central
to
maintaining
the
rule
of
law.
this
is
not
like
the
other
privileges,
priest-penitent,
other
evidentiary
privileges,
because
it
is
the
privilege
that
allows
lawyers
to
protect
the
interests
in
those
other
cases.
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
--
that
to
allow
a
single
ruling
by
a
district
court
judge
to
undermine
the
privilege
is
going
to
affect
people.
what
--
i
mean,
the
statement
of
the
lawyer
could
be,
look,
you
are
going
to
lose
this
case,
and
you
are
saying
the
district
court
can
require
the
disclosure
of
that
without
allowing
at
least
a
quick
trip
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
check
it
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
matters
which
they
do,
right?
if
they
are
denying
disclosure
the
statistics
don't
mean
much.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
is
a
bit
of
a
hurdle,
isn't
it,
since
you
do
have
to
satisfy
the
materially
advanced
--
the
litigation
and
those
other
criteria?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
usual
way
that
the
district
court,
after
denying
the
recognition
of
the
privilege,
insists
that
people
proceed
is,
they
want
the
lawyer
to
go
to
jail.
they
say,
you've
got
contempt,
you
can
appeal
contempt.
the
district
judges,
as
you've
mentioned,
they
want
these
things
to
move
on
and
they
tend
not
to
think
that
their
rulings
are
in
error,
and
the
lawyers
are
frequently
confronted
with
an
extremely
difficult
choice,
of
violating
what
they
think
is
their
ethical
obligation
or
going
to
jail.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
a
protective
order
isn't
going
to
work
--
a
protective
order
isn't
going
to
work
at
all.
you're
not
going
to
--
i
mean,
the
lawyers
on
the
other
side
get
the
privileged
material,
so
they
don't
care
--
i
mean,
in
terms
of
the
viability
and
protection
of
the
privilege,
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
clients
get
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
--
you
know,
the
--
the
american
bar
association
has
said
the
exact
opposite.
it
will
say
that
the
opening
up
of
the
privilege
and
the
disclosure,
however
rare
the
case
is,
will,
in
fact,
undermine
the
--
the
value
of
the
privilege.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
sure,
the
other
people
are,
too,
but
we
--
i,
at
least,
look
at
a
brief
of
the
american
bar
association
and
view
that
as
a
representation
of
how
the
people
affected
here,
the
lawyers,
view
the
value
of
the
privilege
and
what
will
happen
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
but
the
law
--
the
law
professors
aren't
the
ones
who
deal
with
this
question
on
a
day-to-day
basis
and
have
to
worry
about
going
to
jail,
if
they
want
to
protect
their
client's
--
what
they
view
as
their
ethical
obligations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
except
when
the
government
is
the
one
raising
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but,
in
the
government
context,
what
would
be
in
the
private
context,
an
attorney-client
privilege,
is
redressed
as
a
different
type
of
governmental
privilege.
when
you
give
advice
to
a
government
agency,
you
don't
call
that
the
attorney-client
privilege.
you
call
it
a
governmental
privilege,
a
deliberative
privilege,
all
these
other
things.
in
the
private
sector,
when
you
are
an
attorney
and
you
give
advice
to
a
client,
you
can't
say,
this
has
got
something.
it's
the
attorney-client
privilege.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
that
you
--
government
lawyers
cannot
seek
an
interlocutory
appeal
of
any
privilege
claimed,
other
than
presidential
communications
and
state
secrets?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
there
are
problems
with
1292(b).
are
you
telling
me,
when
your
office
writes
a
letter
to
the
department
of
interior
and
says,
look,
we
are
not
going
to
appeal
--
we
will
appeal
your
case,
but
we
think
you
have
got
a
really
bad
case,
you
are
likely
to
lose;
and
you
assert
--
the
only
privilege
you
can
assert
is
the
attorney-client
privilege,
and,
if
a
district
judge
says,
that's
not
covered,
for
one
reason
or
another,
you
--
you
don't
get
an
interlocutory
appeal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
the
attorney-client
privileges
rises
to
the
level
of
who
gets
to
--
who
has
to
put
up
security
for
costs
that
was
an
issue
in
cohen?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
are
not
talking
about
--
i
guess
what,
perhaps,
the
case
comes
down
to
is,
if
you
think
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
like
every
other
evidentiary
privilege
that
you
have
just
listed,
relevance,
materiality,
all
those
sorts
of
things,
or
if
you
think
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
different,
even
more
important
than
who
has
to
post
security
for
costs,
because
it
is
central
to
the
rule
of
law,
because
it
is
central
to
how
the
adversary
system
functions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
review
--
i
follow
your
answer
but
the
review
on
final
judgment
is
meaningless.
i
mean,
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
injury
to
the
party,
but
not
the
injury
to
the
attorney-client
privilege.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
putting
aside
the
question
of
whether
the
attorney-client
privilege
has
a
good
pedigree
in
public
law,
my
experience
has
been
that
litigants
on
one
side
frequently
request
and
demand
in
discovery
material
that
they
know
is
covered
by
the
attorney-client
privilege,
one,
precisely
because
that's
where
the
good
stuff
is;
and
two,
because
it
gives
them
leverage,
because
they
know
that
the
other
side
is
going
to
have
to
go
through
this
impossible
process
and
can't
get
an
immediate
appeal.
why
isn't
that
a
concern
that
we
should
have?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
allen,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
08-678
mohawk
industries
incorporated
versus
carpenter,
justice
sotomayor
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
