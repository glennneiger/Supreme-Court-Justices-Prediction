justice
antonin
scalia
and
for
lawyers?
justice
antonin
scalia
lawyers
have
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
their
clients;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
courts
should
review
lawyers'
fees
for
--
on
the
basis
of
whether
it's
a
fair
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
different
from
normal
trust
law,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
normally
where
you
are
a
fiduciary,
it's
up
to
you
to
prove
that
it
was
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
congress
evidently
did
not
mean
ordinary
trust
law
to
apply
in
this
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
he
protects
the
company
ultimately,
because
when
investors
leave
the
company
that
is
charging
excessive
fees
to
go
to
other
companies,
the
company
that
they
are
leaving
sees
that
something's
wrong
and
has
to
lower
its
compensation
to
its
adviser.
why
doesn't
that
affect
the
company
at
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
i
don't
understand
your
statement
that
they
can't
fire
the
investment
adviser.
maybe
they
can't
fire
him,
but
they
can
insist
that
he
accept
a
lower
fee,
right?
surely
they
can
do
that,
can't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they
insist
that
he
accept
a
lower
fee?
can
they
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
that's
something
different.
let's
assume
you
have
a
disinterested
board
of
directors,
which
is
what
the
statute
requires.
you
tell
me
even
though
they
are
disinterested,
they
can't
fire
the
adviser.
it
seems
to
me,
while
they
can't
fire
him,
they
can
say:
we
are
going
to
cut
your
fee
in
half.
whereupon
they
don't
have
to
fire
him.
he
will
pack
up
and
leave,
and
they
will
get
a
new
adviser.
doesn't
that
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
must
be
aware
of
the
--
of
the
divergence
between
the
fees
that
investment
advisers
charge
to
these
companies
and
what
they
charge
to
other
clients.
isn't
the
sec
aware
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
has
brought
no
suits
against
this
industry?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
disclosure,
just
for
disclosure.
but
that
suggests
to
me
that
the
sec
may
think
that
this
is
indeed
a
self-contained
industry
and
that
the
comparison
with
investment
advice
given
to
other
entities
is
--
is
not
a
fair
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if
there
is
full
disclosure,
your
position
is
in
every
case
a
court
must
decide
whether
the
fee
is
reasonable
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
wonderfully
clear
command,
isn't
it?
such
consideration
as
is
appropriate?
what
is
the
language?
read
it.
what
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it's
meaningless.
it
tells
the
court
to
make
its
own
judgment.
such
consideration
as
the
court
deems
due.
give
it
whatever
--
whatever
consideration
you
--
you
feel
like.
it's
utterly
meaningless
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
applied?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
applied,
whose
judgment
you
want
us
to
affirm?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
should
remand
it
for
application
of
the
test
that
you
propose?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
that's
a
disputed
fact,
isn't
it?
and
you
want
us
to
dispose
--
or
you
want
this
to
be
disposed
of
on
summary
judgment.
the
other
side
says
the
services
aren't
that
much
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
talking
about
this
particular
case.
it
was
talking
about
in
general,
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
are
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
--
would
you
give
us
the
citations
of
the
parts
of
the
record
that
you
say
render
it
unnecessary
for
us
to
remand
for
the
lower
court
to
consider
a
comparison
with
non
--
with
institutional
charges?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
16a
of
the
joint
appendix
you
are
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
petition.
