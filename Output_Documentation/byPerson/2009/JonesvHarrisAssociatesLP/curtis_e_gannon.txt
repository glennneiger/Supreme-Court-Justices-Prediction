mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fiduciary
duty
imposed
by
section
36(b)
prohibits
an
investment
adviser's
fee
from
being
outside
the
range
that
arm's-length
bargaining
would
produce.
the
courts
below
erred
by
failing
to
consider
evidence
about
what
the
investment
adviser
in
this
case
charges
its
unaffiliated
clients
when
it
provides
services
that
petitioners
claim
are,
in
fact,
comparable
to
the
services
at
issue
here.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
we
do
think
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
we
do
think
that
the
term
v.
litton,
the
case
that
counsel
for
petitioners
was
already
referring
to.
that's
a
case
that
actually
involved
corporate
directors
and
there
the
same
test,
the
same
ultimate
standard,
was
stated,
which
is
whether
the
bargain
carries
the
earmarks
of
an
arm's
length
bargain
and
whether
it's
inherently
fair.
and
so
we
do
think
that
in
the
development
of
the
legislation
in
1969,
the
memorandum
that
the
sec
submitted
to
congress
in
1969
explained
that
the
shift
from
reasonableness
to
fiduciary
duty
largely
achieved
some
procedural
objectives
of
shifting
the
focus
from
the
board
of
directors
to
the
investment
adviser,
and
the
text
of
the
statute
specifically
makes
it
a
fiduciary
duty
with
respect
to
receipt
of
compensation.
we
think
one
salutary
affect
of
that
was
to
--
to
make
it
clear
that
the
court's
burden
here,
the
court's
duty
here,
wasn't
just
to
establish
what
the
single
most
reasonable
fee
would
be,
but
harking
back
to
the
pepper
v.
litton
test,
whether
the
bargain
fell
within
the
range
of
what
arm's
length
bargaining
otherwise
would
have
achieved.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
in
the
abstract,
it
might
make
more
sense,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
choice
that
congress
made
here
was
to
counterbalance
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
even
under
this
statute,
the
sec
has
the
authority
to
file
suits
under
section
36(b).
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it
hasn't
filed
any
since
--
since
1980,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
the
sec
in
this
context
--
it
has
--
it
has
primarily
directed
its
resources
and
energies
into
encouraging
there
to
be
better
disclosure
of
fees,
both
the
disclosure
of
information
to
the
board,
disclosure
to
investors,
better
education
to
shareholders
so
that
they
would
be
able
to
go--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
is
aware
of
that.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
since
1980
it
hasn't
used
section
36(b).
it
has
used
less
formal
mechanisms
in
the
context
of
examinations
and
investigators--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
when
the
sec
helped
draft
the
statute
in
the
1960s,
it
recognized
that
there
was
this
systematic
disparity
between
the
amounts
that
mutual
funds
were
being
charged
by
investment
advisers
and
the
amounts
that
investment
advisers
were
charging
their
unaffiliated
clients,
and
in
the
1969
memorandum
that
i
referred
to,
which
is
reprinted
in
an
appendix
to
the
amicus
brief
by
john
bogel
in
its
entirety,
the
sec
mentioned
that
comparison
as
being
something
that
may
well
be
relevant
in
proving
in
an
individual
case
that
that
particular
investment
adviser's
fees
are
excessive.
and
we
think
that
the
test
here
of
whether
under
all
the
circumstances,
which
is
what
section
36(b)(2)
points
the
court
towards,
of
having
to
weigh
--
having
to
weigh
the
board's
approval
of
fees
in
light
of
all
the
circumstances,
that
those
circumstances
include
things
like
the
evidence
that
petitioners
have
presented
here.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
it
also
comes,
justice
ginsburg,
from
the
text
of
section
36(b)(2).
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
footnote
that
you
are
talking
about
did
point
out
that
in
that
case
the
comparison
that
the
plaintiffs
were
attempting
to
draw
between
the
money
market
fund
at
issue
and
a
pension
fund
wasn't
a
particularly
relevant
one,
because
the
services
at
issue
were
so
different.
and
here
the
parties
appear
to
dispute
how
different
the
services
are.
and
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
the
respondent
stated
that
it
disputed
how
comparable
the
relevant
services
were.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
considered
that
dispute
immaterial
because,
instead
of
comparing,
instead
of
determining
whether
this
investment
adviser
is
selling
the
same
services
at
half
the
price
to
its
unaffiliated
clients
who
actually
can
engage
in
arm's
length
bargaining,
those
courts
simply
said
that
if
it
--
if
it
falls
within
the
range
that
is
charged
by
other
mutual
funds,
that
would
be
acceptable.
and
we--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
does
say
that
you
should
give
the
board--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--such
consideration
as
is
deemed
appropriate
under
all
the
circumstances.
that's
correct.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
that
it
demonstrates
that
the
court
is
obligated
to
look
to
all
the
circumstances
simply
to
determine
whether
the
board's
approval
--
how
much
weight
it
should
be
given.
and
as
this
court
explained
in
daily
income
fund,
the
entire
point
of
section
36(b)
is
to
provide
an
independent
check,
the
--
independent
of
the
fact
that
the
directors
approved
the
fees.
we
think
that
an
appropriately
informed
board
that
asks
the
right
questions,
that
gets
the
right
information
and
fully
considers
the
sort
of
factors
that
are
discussed--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
think
that
--
that
the
right
process
followed
by
the
board
would
be
probative,
but
something
like
double
the
price
may
--
may
demonstrate
that
that
is
an
unfair
bargain.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
if
there
was
a
lack
of
full
disclosure,
that
might
in
the
abstract
be
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
even
under
the
seventh
circuit's
test.
we
think
that
if
it
didn't
actually
have
an
effect
on
the
fees,
then
it
wouldn't
be
actionable
here
because
there
would
be
no
actual
damages
flowing
from
the
lack
of
disclosure.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
a
court
would
need
to
decide
whether
the
plaintiff
has
met
its
burden
of
proving
that
it
falls
outside
the
range
of
fees
that
arm's-length
bargaining
would
have
arrived
at,
and
that's
a
cause
of
action
that
would
be--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
the
term
of
art
of
"fiduciary
duty"
doesn't
necessarily
demonstrate
how
much
deviance
away
from
the
range
there
would
be.
i
think
that
depending
upon
the
segment
of
the
market
the
range
might
be
more
or
less
narrow.
in
segments
of
the
market
where
services
are
more
commodified
and
standardized,
perhaps
with
index
funds,
there
might
be
a
much
narrower
range
of
fees
that
are
arrived
at
through
arm's-length
bargaining,
and
even
--
and
smaller
disparities
might
be
inappropriate
there.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it
--
i
think
that
the
chief
way
it
differs
from
reasonableness,
justice
kennedy,
is
in
saying
that
the
court
doesn't
actually
have
to
decide
what
the
single
most
reasonable
fee
is.
but
as
the
sec
explained
in
1969,
the
shift
from
reasonableness
to--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
reasonableness
is
--
is
inevitably
going
to
be
part
of
the
inherent
fairness
inquiry
that
this
court
referred
to
in
pepper
v.
litton
as
being
part
of
the
fiduciary
duty
status
as
to
whether
the
transaction--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
--
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
different
from
the
status
of
a
president
of
a
corporation;
that
--
that
the
term
of
art,
"fiduciary"
which
congress
was
invoking
here
can
mean
different
things
in
different
circumstances.
pepper
was
a
case
that
involved
corporate
directors.
the
chief
difference
here
and
what
congress
was
intending
to
counteract
was
the
inherent
structural
impediment
to
arm's-length
bargaining
between
the
investment
adviser
and
the
board
of
directors.
and
that's
what
makes
that
high
burden
that
was
used
in
pepper
v.
litton
for
controlling
shareholders
the
relevant
analogy,
we
believe.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
