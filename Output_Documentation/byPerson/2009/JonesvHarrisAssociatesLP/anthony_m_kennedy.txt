is
harris
a
fiduciary
in
the
same
sense
as
a
corporate
officer
and
a
corporate
director?
or
does
his
fiduciary
duty
differ?
is
it
higher
or
lower,
same
with
a
guardian,
same
with
a
trustee?
i
mean,
the
word
"fiduciary"
--
does
fiduciary
imply
different
standards,
depending
on
what
kind
of
fiduciary
you
are?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
the
test
for
compensation
in
this
case
be
the
same
as
any
director
or
any
officer
of
a
corporation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
know,
is
the
fiduciary
duties
the
same?
is
the
fiduciary
standard
the
same,
without
getting
into
how
its
applied?
is
the
fiduciary
standard
the
same
for
jones,
for
a
guardian,
for
a
trustee,
for
a
corporate
officer
or
a
corporate
director,
always
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
that
congress
used
"fiduciary"
in
a
special
sense.
then
--
then,
i
have
to
conclude
that
your
earlier
answer
is
confusing
for
me,
because
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
us
that
this
investment
adviser
has
the
same
fiduciary
standard
that
officers
and
directors
of
corporations
have.
then
you
say
that
congress
used
it
in
this
special
sense.
so
that
doesn't
quite
square.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
congress
used
the
term
"fiduciary"
in
a
very
special
sense
here?
i
will
just
tell
you
the
problem
i'm
having
with
the
case.
if
i
look
at
a
standard
that
the
fees
must
be
reasonable
and
i
compare
that
with
what
a
fiduciary
would
do,
i
thought
a
fiduciary
has
the
highest
possible
duty.
but
apparently
the
submission
is
the
fiduciary
has
a
lower
duty,
a
lesser
duty
than
to
charge
a
reasonable
fee.
i
just
find
that
quite
a
puzzling
use
of
the
word
"fiduciary".
now,
if
congress
uses
it
as
a
term
of
art
or
in
some
special
sense,
fine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
an
odd
use
of
the
term
"fiduciary".
i
don't
know
why
congress
didn't
use
some
other
word.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
the
--
how
is
the
standard
you've
just
described
different
from
a
standard
of
reasonableness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
"reasonableness"
always
meant
one
--
one
figure.
it
could
mean
a
range.
