justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
section
36b
of
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
imposes
a
fiduciary
duty
on
investment
advisors
with
respect
to
the
receipt
of
compensation
for
services
provided
to
the
mutual
funds
they
manage.
the
petitioners
who
are
shareholders
in
mutual
funds
managed
by
respondent
investment
advisor
filed
this
suit
alleging
that
respondent
violated
the
fiduciary
duty
by
charging
excessive
fees.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
the
appropriate
standard
for
determining
whether
an
investment
advisor
has
violated
its
fiduciary
duty
is
the
standard
outlined
by
the
second
circuit
over
25
years
ago
in
gartenberg
versus
merrill
lynch
asset
management
inc.
under
the
gartenberg
standard,
to
be
guilty
of
a
violation
of
section
36b
an
investment
adviser
must
charge
a
fee,
that
is
so
disproportionately
large
it
bears
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
services
rendered
and
could
not
have
been
the
product
of
arms
length
bargaining.
this
standard
reflects
the
meaning
of
the
term
fiduciary
duty
as
described
in
our
analogous
cases
as
well
as
section
30-6b's
place
in
the
statutory
scheme
because
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
adopt
the
gartenberg
standard,
we
vacate
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
judgment
of
court
is
unanimous,
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
