chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-586,
jones
v.
harris
associates.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
this
is
different.
i
mean,
this
is
part
of
an
expense
of
a
fund.
they
don't
get
fees,
but
--
but
they
get
--
they
have
to
pay
for
the
lawyers,
just
like
they
have
to
pay
for
management
advice.
so
why
wouldn't
you
review
the
lawyers'
fees
to
make
sure
they
are
fair?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel
for
the
fund.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
if
you
are
having
courts
decide
--
review
what
is
fair,
a
fair
fee,
what
if
the
adviser
had
given
such
good
advice
that
the
fund
beat
the
industry
average
for
his
category
of
fund
by
5
percent
over
the
last
5
years.
does
he
get
double
the
normal
compensation
of
the
average
fees?
does
he
get
triple?
50
percent
more?
how
is
the
court
supposed
to
decide
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
surely
you
think
it
is.
when
you
say
they
don't
give
the
money
back,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
amount
of
the
fees
should
be
the
same
regardless
of
whether
they
outperform
by
10
percent
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
is
different
parameters,
right,
in
the
sense
that
you're
trying
--
the
company
is
trying
to
attract
investors
to
the
mutual
fund.
if
you
are
advising
a
pension
fund,
it
is
not
the
case
that
they
are
trying
to
attract
pensioners
who
have
other
choices.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
technological
changes
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
disclosures
required?
these
days
all
you
have
to
do
is
push
a
button
and
you
find
out
exactly
what
the
management
fees
are.
i
mean,
you
just
look
it
up
on
morningstar
and
it's
right
there
and
you
can
make
--
as
an
investor
you
can
make
whatever
determination
you'd
like,
including
to
take
your
money
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
could
look
at
--
you
know,
as
the
fund
grows
bigger
and
he
doesn't
get
those
benefits
he
can
go
look
at
another
fund.
it
takes
30
seconds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
companies
--
companies
change
who
they
invest
with
under
the
401(k)'s
all
the
time.
the
employees
are
not
happy
with
the
return
they
are
getting
because
the
company
has
limited
their
choices,
they
change.
it
happens
all
the
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
told
me
just
a
little
while
ago,
or
told
somebody,
congress
wasn't
interested
in
protecting
investors;
they
were
interested
in
protecting
the
companies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
we
are
going
to
have
regulation
of
what
fees
can
be
charged,
you
cite
in
your
brief
the
various
regulations
the
sec
has
issued.
it
makes
a
lot
more
sense
to
have
the
sec
regulate
rates
than
to
have
courts
do
it,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
not
suggesting
the
sec
wouldn't
have
authority
to
do
that,
are
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
statute
does
not
say,
in
considering
the
rates
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
am
i
right?
it
says,
in
considering
whether
to
defer
to
the
board,
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
board.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
isn't
that
different
than
saying,
in
looking
at
what
the
rates
should
be
or
whether
they
are
excessive,
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances?
it
may
well
be
that
you
don't
defer
to
the
board,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it's
a
free-for-all
in
deciding
what
you
do
look
at.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
is
"so
far
out
of
bounds"?
in
other
words,
you
are
saying,
you
can
look
at
what
the
directors
did
if
it's,
as
you
said,
too
far
out
of
bounds,
but
10
percent
off,
50
percent
off?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
double,
as
they
say
is
the
case
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
double,
as
they
say
is
the
case
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
you
say:
look
to
see
if
it's
outside
the
bounds,
and
now
you
tell
me
there
is
no
way
to
look
to
see
if
it's
outside
the
bounds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
you
should
look
at
the
range
and
how
far
it's
off,
do
you
mean
that
in
the
gartenberg
sense
--
in
other
words,
if
it
is
way
out
of
line,
then
you
assume
or
can
at
least
look
further
at
whether
there
was
a
fair
process?
or
do
you
mean
it
in
the
normal
case,
in
sort
of
setting
the
rates
you
just
look
how
far
it
is
off.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
probably
--
you're
not
the
person
to
--
to
ask,
but
do
you
understand
the
solicitor
general's
position
to
be
your
understanding
of
the
gartenberg
sense
or
something
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
your
friend
correct,
that
these
funds
have
better
than
average
performance
and
lower
than
average
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
in
this
morning
in
case
08-586
jones
versus
harris
associates.
