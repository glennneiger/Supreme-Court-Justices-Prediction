but
there
was
in
this
record,
was
there
not,
a
submission
by
the
adviser
comparing
what
mutual
funds
this
fund
was
charged,
what
institutional
funds
were
charged,
but
explaining
the
differential
in
terms
of
the
services
provided,
that
more
services
were
provided
to
the
fund
and
less
services
were
provided
to
the
institutional
investors.
justice
ruth

who
would
have
the
burden?
you
said
that
is
an
issue
that
has
not
been
decided,
it's
a
disputed
issue
of
fact,
appropriate
for
remand.
who
--
would
you
have
the
burden
if
they
came
forward
and
said,
look,
this
is
what
our
situation
is.
these
are
the
services.
would
you
have
the
burden
to
show
that
in
fact
they
were
comparable
and
the
differences
did
not
warrant
the
differences
in
the
fee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
have
the
burden?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
filed
any?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gannon,
the
--
all
the
circumstances,
that
comes
from
the
second
circuit's
gartenberg
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
--
in
that
case,
at
least
there
was
a
footnote
that
seemed
to
say,
you
don't
have
to
engage
in
a
--
in
the
comparison
with
what
institutional
investors
are
paid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
the
fund
adviser
here
--
i
mean,
the
investment
adviser
did
disclose
--
that's
in
the
record
--
did
disclose
the
difference
between
what
were
charged
mutual
funds,
what
were
charged
institutional
investors,
and
then
explained
that
the
services
were
different
and
that
justified
the
difference.
but
they
weren't
trying
to
think,
no,
we
don't
have
to
come
forward
with
this
information.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
--
but
in
the
seventh
circuit,
judge
easterbrook
said,
mainly
you
have
to
look
to
see
if
there
was
full
disclosure,
and
then
there
might
be
cases
where
it's
so
out
of
line.
and
he
said
the
comparison
would
be
to
other
mutual
funds.
he
excluded
the
comparison
with
institutional
investors.
so
to
that
extent,
was
the
second
circuit
wrong,
saying
this
is
not
a
relevant
factor;
what
other
mutual
funds
pay
investment
advisors
may
be
a
relevant
factor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
petitioners'
allegation
that
the
investment
adviser
did
not
provide
full
and
accurate
information?
and
they
mention
particularly
concerning
economies
of
scale,
profitability,
and
several
other
matters,
that
what
everybody
agrees
is
necessary,
full
disclosure,
had
not
occurred.
is
that
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
or
of
further
inquiry?
