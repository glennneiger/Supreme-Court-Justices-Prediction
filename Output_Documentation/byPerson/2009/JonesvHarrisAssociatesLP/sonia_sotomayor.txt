justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
can
i
unpackage
your
argument
a
little
bit.
because
using
the
word
"fair
fee"
in
my
mind
is
meaningless,
because
it
has
to
be
fair
in
relationship
to
something.
and
so
what
is
your
definition
of
what
that
something
is
that
it's
fair
to,
and
--
or
unfair
against?
and
start
from
there,
because
i
understood
the
seventh
circuit
to
be
saying:
look,
a
fair
fee
is
paying
market
value.
if
one
takes
a
sort
of
reading
--
whatever
negotiation
goes
on
between
the
two,
as
long
as
there
has
been
full
disclosure
as
required,
that's
the
market.
so
that's
fair.
you're
saying
it's
something
else.
what's
that
something
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
you
start
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
let's
stop
confusing
this
--
the
articulation
of
the
standard,
which
is
--
that's
fair.
what
would
an
arm's-length
transaction
produce?
and
let's
go
to
what
seems
to
be
part
of
your
argument
and
sort
of
what
everyone's
skirting
around,
which
is
what's
the
proof
that
a
particular
transaction
is
not
arm's-length?
the
seventh
circuit
appeared
to
be
saying,
it's
arm's-length
when
the
parties
have
done
all
of
the
disclosure
that
is
required,
because
then
the
buyer
can
decide
whether
they
want
to
pay
that
fee
or
not,
and
once
they
choose
to
it's
a
fair
price.
it's
an
arm's
length
transaction.
you
are
saying
not,
and
that's
what
--
that's
where
i
am
trying
to
get
to
the
nub
of
why
not?
why
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
--
now,
that's
begging
the
question,
because
congress
hasn't
said
a
reasonable
fee.
it
did
say
fiduciary
duty,
but
it
didn't
--
there
is
a
subtle
but
very
important
difference
between
reasonable
and
--
a
reasonable
fee
and
a
fiduciary
duty
with
respect
to
fees.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
still
begging
the
question,
fair
against
what.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
if
they
agree
to
pay
double
the
price?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
that's
what
--
are
you
advocating
that
there
is
a
stand-alone
cause
of
action
or
breach
of
duty
when
there
isn't
full
disclosure,
even
if
the
fee
is
within
arm's
length
--
normal
--
begging
the
question
of
what's
normal,
but
assuming
that
it's
within
an
arm's-length
transaction
range
in
the
market?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
much
deviance,
and
what
is
the
scope
of
the
range?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
that
all
of
the
independent
board
of
director
members
vote
for
a
particular
fee,
but
the
fee
is
negotiated
by
an
insider,
and
the
insider
is
the
one
who
does
the
evaluation,
looks
at
them
and
says:
i
think
this
is
really
a
great
deal,
guys.
and
they
just
fell
for
it.
is
that
a
process
that
would
guarantee
an
arm's-length
transaction
in
the
sense
that
congress
intended
in
this
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
cause
of
action--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--under
what?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
then
their
process
is
part
of
your
definition
of
"fiduciary
duty"?
a
court
has
to
look
at
the
nature
of
process?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
--
now
you
are
adding
what
has
been
added,
which
is
outside
of
the
range,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
but
what
you
are
--
but
what
you
are
arguing
is,
if
the
process
is
fair,
even
if
the
fee
is
outside
the
range
of
an
arm'slength
transaction,
there
is
no
cause
of
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
that
they
claim
that
you
were
receiving
additional
payment
for
the
services,
or
some
or
at
least
a
substantial
number
of
the
services,
that
you
claim
are
attributed
by
the
difference.
so
they're
saying
if
you
compare
apples
to
apples,
you
are
charging
twice
the
amount.
if
you
compare
apples
to
oranges,
there
are
differences
because
the
oranges
were
different,
but
you
were
getting
paid
for
those
oranges
separately.
i
think
that
was
their
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
the
issue
of
disputed
fact.
so
let's
go
back.
are
you
disavowing
the
seventh
circuit's
approach?
because
i
read
your
brief
and
it
doesn't
appear
as
if
you
are
defending
their
market
approach
that
says
so
long
as
the
process
was
fair,
any
fee
is
okay.
that's
how
i
thought
they
had
reached
their
conclusion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
i'm
talking
--
i
am
using
his
words
in
terms
of
case--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
you're
disavowing
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
positions
is
no
different
than
the
solicitor
general's,
that
there
has
to
be
some
measure
of
fair
process
and
some
measure
of
a
fair
fee,
at
least
within
--
in
terms
of
it
not
being
outside
the
range
an
arm's
length
transaction?
