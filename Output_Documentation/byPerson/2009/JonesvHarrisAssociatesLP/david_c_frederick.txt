mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1970,
congress
amended
the
investment
company
act
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
when
an
investment
adviser
breaches
its
fiduciary
duty
with
respect
to
compensation.
the
seventh
circuit
upheld
summary
judgment
for
respondent
under
a
legal
standard
for
fiduciary
duty
that
respondent
here
no
longer
defends.
for
three
reasons,
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
should
be
reversed.
first,
under
the
court's
longstanding
precedent,
in
this
context
a
fiduciary
duty
requires
a
fair
fee,
achieved
through
full
disclosure
and
good-faith
negotiation.
second,
the
best
gauge
of
a
fair
fee
is
what
the
investment
adviser
charges
at
arm's-length
in
other
transactions
for
similar
services.
and,
third,
applying
that
standard
here,
harris
charged
twice
as
much
in
percentage
terms
for
providing
virtually
identical
advisory
services
in
arm's-length
transactions
with
institutional
investors.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
the
standard
for
fiduciary
duty
has
been
clear
from
this
court's
cases,
at
least
since
pepper
v.
litton,
in
which
the
court
said
that
a
fair
result
in
the
circumstances
--
a
fair
fee
--
was
an
important
component
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
congress
was
aware
of
that
standard
when
it
enacted
the
1970
amendments
to
the
investment
company
act.
the
sec
brought
the
case
to
the
congress'
attention,
and
that
standard,
we
submit,
is
one
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate.
applying
that
standard,
where
pepper
said
that
the
best
gauge
of
a
fair
fee
is
what
the
person
--
the
fiduciary
charges
in
arm's-length
transactions,
applied
here,
the
best
way
to
understand
how
that
fiduciary
duty
is
being
breached
in
this
context
is
what
harris
is
charging
for
same
or
similar
services
at
arm's-length
to
institutional
investors.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
basic
concept,
justice
kennedy,
is
the
same.
there
are
two
components,
where
there
must
be
full
disclosure
of
information
and
a
fair
result,
and
that
fair
result
translates
in
different
contexts
in
different
ways.
here,
because
of
the
statutory
references
to
fiduciary
duty
with
respect
to
compensation,
one
focuses
on
the
fairness
of
the
fee
charged.
but,
as
professor
dumont
points
out
in
her
amicus
brief,
the
idea
of
a
fiduciary
duty
is
one
that
is
well
known
in
various
circumstances
of
the
law,
and
as
applied
here
the
concept
goes
to
the
fairness
of
the
fee.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
difference
here,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
in
those
circumstances
the
indicia
of
an
arm's-length
transaction
may
be
achieved.
the
directors
can
fire
the
head
of
a
company.
they
can
call
for
changes.
here,
the
investment
adviser
has
appointed
the
members
of
the
board.
as
this
court
said
in
the
daily
income
fund
case,
the
earmarks
of
an
--
of
an
arm's-length
transaction
are
absent
precisely
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
the
concept
is
fair
result
through
full
information
and
good-faith
negotiations.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
for
lawyers--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
is
true.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
how
courts
do
it
every
day
in
this
country,
justice
scalia,
when
they
are
asked
to
make
fee
applications
for
reasonableness.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
lawyers'
fees
in
which
context,
mr.
chief
justice?
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
counsel
for
the
fund
is
--
that
is
actually
not
at
issue
here,
but
the
issue
of
what
constitutes
reasonable
expenses
may
arise
in
various
circumstances.
the
statute
prohibits
fees
that
are
unreasonable
in
terms
of
their
unfairness
to
the
fund.
the
concept
here
is
that
the
board
cannot
fire
the
investment
adviser.
so
in
evaluating
the
fairness
of
the
fee
the
adviser
is
charging
the
fund,
the
normal
indicia
of
an
arm's-length
transaction
is
absent,
and
that
is
the
key
principle
here
because
this
adviser
is
using
the
same
manager
to
provide
the
same
research
analytics
from
the
same
research
group,
from
the
same
meetings,
buying
the
same
stocks,
and
simply
allocating
them
to
different
accounts
and
charging
those
to
whom
it
owes
a
fiduciary
duty
twice
what
it
is
getting
at
arm's-length.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
where
there
is
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
for
which
summary
judgment
is
not
appropriate,
because
the
plaintiffs
submitted
evidence
that
in
fact
the
services
provided
to
the
institutional
investors
were
greater,
even
though
they
were
being
charged
a
lower
amount
of
money.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
have
the
burden.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
true.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
disagree
with
that
last
part,
justice
scalia.
we
agree
that
congress
did
make
modifications
to
the
way
a
cause
of
action
ordinarily
would
have
been
brought
at
common
law
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
in
several
respects,
including
imposing
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
investor.
where
we
disagree
is
that
when
they
used
the
phrase
"fiduciary
duty"
they
intended
to
mean
something
less
than
what
fiduciary
duty
had
meant
at
common
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
there
is
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
how
relevant
performance
is.
they
didn't
give
the
money
back
when
their
performance
lagged
behind
the
market,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case.
so
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
performance
metric
is
relevant
is
certainly
a
factor
that
will
be
entitled
to
less--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
when
they
charge
the
same
amount,
buying
the
same
stocks,
to
institutional
investors
and
achieve
the
same
performance,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
mutual
fund
should
be
charged
twice
as
much.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
the
investor
doesn't
gain
because
of
the
marketing
skill
of
the
adviser.
simply
having
a
larger
asset
pool
which
increases
the
fee
that
the
adviser
can
charge
doesn't
inure
to
the
individual
benefit
of
the
investor.
and
the
point
of
this
statute
was
to
provide
protection
against
investors
so
that
when
the
adviser
charged
excessive
fees
that
excess
would
be
returned
to
the
fund
for
the
pro
rata
benefit--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
just
add
the
extra
words
of
the
statute,
because
what
congress
said
was
a
fiduciary
duty
"with
respect
to
compensation".
and
so
when
i
say
special
sense,
i
mean
that
congress
used
additional
words
to
elaborate
on
the
circumstance
in
which
the
fiduciary
duty
would
be
examined.
here
what
is
happening
is
that
an
arm's-length
transaction
for
the
same
services
--
the
same
manager
is
going
out
and
touting
his
services
to
the
institutional
investor,
but
simply
charging
them
half
as
much
money
for
providing
the
same
portfolio
of
management.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
fact
that
an
investor
may
know
going
in
what
the
fee
is
does
not
address
the
problem
congress
was
intending
to
address,
which
is
that
as
larger
and
larger
sums
of
assets
were
accreted
to
the
mutual
fund,
the
investor
was
not
obtaining
the
benefits
of
economies
of
scale.
and
that's
the
central
point--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
that
again
doesn't
address
the
problem
congress
was
trying
to
get
at,
which
is
to
protect
the
company,
not
the
individual
investor.
the
individual
investor
might
lessen
the
damages
that
that
investor
suffers,
but
the
fund,
the
people
remaining,
continue
to
pay
excessive
fees.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
a
large
number
of
assets
under
management
in
mutual
funds,
something
like
26
to
35
percent
according
to
materials
that
are
in
the
record,
are
from
401(k)
plans,
where
the
investor
is
essentially
locked
into
the
fund
that
his
or
her
company
chooses
to
make
that
investment.
and
even
as
to
investors
who
are
not
locked
in,
there
are
significant
tax
consequences
where
over
time
an
investor
might
be
in
the
oakmark
fund
and
have
to
suffer
large
tax
consequences
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
statute--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
mr.
chief
justice,
as
the
court
recognized
in
the
daily
income
fund
case,
this
is
a
unique
cause
of
action
in
which
congress
was
intending
to
protect
the
entire
corpus
of
the
investors
in
the
fund,
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
company
is
comprised
of
the
investors,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
the
right
of
action
does
not
do
is
to
provide
individual
damages
to
the
investor
who
brings
the
suit.
the
recovery
inures
to
the
entire
benefit
of
all
the
investors.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
what
the
court
said
in
pepper
is
that
fair
is
what
is
reflective
of
what
an
arm's-length
agreement
would
produce.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
the
directors
can't
fire
and
walk
away
from
the
advisor.
in
any
arm'slength
transaction,
if
i
sell
you
a
car
and
you
don't
like
the
price
can
you
walk
away.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
true.
there
are
two
components:
was
there
full
information
and
good
faith
negotiating;
and
was
the
result
fair.
in
pepper,
the
court
said
if
the
result
is
not
fair
there
can
be
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
fair
against
what
the
adviser
actually
charged
for
same
or
similar
services
to
an
outsider
who
had
the
right
to
walk
away.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
practical
terms,
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
the
adviser
picks
the
board
of
directors.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
is
actually
no
evidence
in
any
record
i
am
aware
of
where
that
has
actually
happened.
the
directors
have
no
leverage.
and
that's
the
problem
the
court
--
this
court
recognized
in
the
daily
income
fund
case.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
at
this
recording
here
did
not
make
findings
--
this
was
a
summary
judgment
case,
and
in
fact,
the
court
didn't
find
that
the
disputes
were
nonexistent.
in
fact,
on
page
30a,
the
district
court
said
that
the
disputes
were
nonmaterial,
and
that's
a
very
important
distinction
because
the
joint
appendix
that
you
have
before
you
contains
a
lot
of
evidence
in
which
it
is
disputed
whether
or
not
these
were
similar
services.
the
harris
manager
on
page
6
--
ja
650,
the
portfolio
holdings
of
the
funds,
are
very
similar.
on
512,
the
harris
fund
manager
testimony
that,
when
he
buys
a
stock,
he
buys
it
for
all
mutual
funds
and
independent
accounts,
with
the
same
investment
objective.
on
505
to
506,
the
harris
research
director
testimony
that
the
managers
of
the
mutual
funds
and
independent
accounts
share
equally
all
work
done
by
the
research
department,
and
513
to
514,
that
the
harris
fund
manager
says
all
of
our
analysts
do
research
for
all
of
our
clients.
there
is
disputed
evidence
here
as
to
what
constitutes
similarity,
justice
sotomayor,
these
are
comparing
apples
to
apples
because
the
record
indicates
that
there
are
separate
contracts
for
the
additional
fees
that
they
charge
to
the
mutual
funds
for
the
additional
services
provided.
we're
simply
talking
about
comparisons
of
money
management,
but--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
one
small
aspect
of
the
damages
period,
that
is
correct,
and
after
that
was
found,
they
had
lower
than
average
performance
and
higher
than
average
fees,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
a
damages
period
that
encompasses
several
years.
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
point,
though,
about
the
fiduciary
duty,
what
judge
cardozo,
when
he
was
on
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
said,
a
fiduciary
represents
the
punctilio
of
honor,
and
that
is
contrasted
with
the
morals
of
the
marketplace
operating
at
arm's-length.
it
surely
cannot
be
the
case
that,
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
fiduciary
duty
--
which
is
a
higher
standard
recognized
in
the
law
--
that
you
can
charge
twice
as
much
as
what
you
are
obtaining
at
arm's-length
for
services
that
you
are
providing.
the
gartenberg
court,
justice
breyer,
in
fact,
had
the
opposite
language
that
you
are
averting
to,
and
that
is
at
page
694
f.
2nd
928,
where
the
court
said,
"the
test
is
essentially
whether
the
fee
schedule
represents
a
charge
within
the
range
of
what
would
have
been
negotiated
at
arm's-length
in
the
light
of
all
the
surrounding
circumstances.
"
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
right.
the
second
circuit
that
went
on
to
flip
it
and
say,
we
had
to
prove
a
negative,
which
is
not
ordinarily
what
a
plaintiff
has
to
prove
in
any
law
case,
by
showing
it
--
it
is
so
disproportionate
it
could
not
have
been
achieved
at
arm's-length,
and
that
is
where
we
think
the
court
--
courts
have
gotten
this
wrong.
