mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
point
that
mr.
gannon
just
made
and
that
mr.
frederick
made
before,
that
there
was
some
structural
impediment
to
negotiations
between
a
mutual
fund
board
and
adviser,
is
at
the
heart
of
this
dispute,
because
that
is
a
judgment
that
congress
made.
the
investment
company
act
in
the
first
instance
delegates
responsibility
to
the
board
of
directors
to
approve
fees.
a
fee
may
not
be
approved
that
does
not
have
the
consent
of
a
majority
of
the
independent
trustees
in
the
first
instance.
the
independent
check
on
fees
that
is
erected
by
section
36(b)--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--it
may
not
and
it
may
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action.
but
as
i
started--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--a
cause
of
action--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--it
may
give
a
cause
of
action
under
section
36(b)
if
the
circumstances
you
described,
justice
sotomayor
are
--
have
an
impact
upon
the
fee.
and
the
reason--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--if
there
is
an
impact
upon
fee
that
is
outside
of
the
range
of
what
could
have
been
bargained.
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
will
a
process
flaw
alone
justify
a
section
36(b)
cause
of
action?
my
answer
is
no.
will
a
process
flaw
that
affects
a
fee
justify
a
36(b)
action?
yes,
it
will.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
no,
i
--
i
--
i
doubt
that
as
well.
there
are
two
separate
causes
of
action,
i
can
imagine,
under
36(b):
one,
a
process
flaw
that
has
a
fee
impact;
and
second,
a
fee
that
is
so
far
outside
of
the
bounds
of
what
could
have
been
bargained
that
it
justifies
independent
review.
the
question
under
36(b)
is
whether,
having
delegated
responsibility
in
the
first
instance
to
a
board,
there
is
a
reason
to
second-guess
their
judgment.
and
the
independent
check
that
mr.
gannon
referred
to
at
section
36(b)
or
(a)
should
not
be
a
de
novo
judicial
review
of
the
size
of
the
fee
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
the
first
of
which
is
section
36(b)(2).
that
statute
instructs
courts
to
give
such
consideration
as
they
consider
due
to
the
deliberations
of
the
board.
what
did
they
see?
what
did
they
get?
did
they
negotiate?
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
the
language
is
"such
consideration
that
the
court
considers
due
under
the
circumstances.
"
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
but
there
would
be
no
reason
for
that
instruction
at
all,
your
honor,
if
a
court
were
to
make
its
own
judgments
about
what
is
fair
and
reasonable.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
what
i
think
congress
was
doing
was
considering
what
the
source
of
the
common
law
had
been
before.
the
corporate
context,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
was
what
inspired.
at
corporate
law,
a
decision
would
not
be
second-guessed
by
a
court
unless
there
was
a
reason
to
do
so,
unless
the
judgment
of
directors
and
the
presumption
of
regularity
that
attached
to
their
decisions
could
for
some
reason
be
second-guessed.
was
there
a
process
flaw?
was
it
so
far
out
of
bounds?
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
mr.
chief--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
as
the
plaintiffs
say
is
the
case
here.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
i
suggest
there
is
no
numerical
basis,
because
in
fact
every
kind
of
mutual
fund
and
ever
stripe
of
mutual
fund
is
different.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
well,
i
think
--
the
first
comparative
would
be
other
funds
of
a
similar
stripe.
so,
for
example,
you
could
imagine
that
a
mutual
fund
with
the
same
investment
objective
and
style
that
is
two
times
might
be
inappropriate.
you
could
also
imagine
a
different
circumstance
where,
passively
managed
funds
for
example,
a
multiple
of
fees
would
be
inappropriate.
you
could
also,
though,
imagine
a
case
where
there
is
substantial
risk
taken,
where
the
types
of
securities
that
are
invested
in
are
unusual,
where
substantial
differences
could
be
justified.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
pardon?
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
test.
judge
easterbrook--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--i
don't
think
you
have
to.
and
the
reason
is
because
of
what
the
district
court
did.
and
there
i
get
to,
justice
ginsburg,
what
you
said.
the
--
the
argument
is
made
that
services
are
the
same.
in
fact,
that
is
not
the
record.
and
if
you
look
at
page
161
of
the
joint
appendix
and
following,
there
is
a
list
of
services
that
the
trust
--
the
investment
adviser
gave
to
the
trustees
in
this
case,
about
all
of
the
services
that
they
did
for
their
fee
in
the
case.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
they
are
very
different.
page
161
and
following
will
tell
you
how.
and
the
district
court
at
page
360
--
16a,
excuse
me,
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
notices
that
the
services
were
different.
so,
under--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--no,
he
was
talking
about
this
case,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
that
is
their
argument
and
it's
not
accurate,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
i
think
what
judge
easterbrook
said,
and
we
don't
agree,
is
if
there
is
deceit
of
directors
that
would
justify
a
cause
of
action
under
36(b).
but
in
the
absence
of,
in
his
words,
"pulling
the
wool
over
the
eyes
of
the
trustees--
"
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--i
do--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--i
do
not
defend
that,
because
i
can
imagine,
as
your
hypothetical
asked
earlier,
directors
or
trustees
who
--
are
not
paying
attention--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--the
solicitor
general
gets
it
right
when
she
describes
gartenberg
as
the
standard.
is
this
a
result
that
could
have
been
fairly
bargained
at
arm's
length.
where
we
part
company
is
with
respect
to
two
things:
one
is,
she
says
and
mr.
gannon
said
today,
that
the
most
important
consideration
is
a
comparison
to
other
kinds
of
fees,
and
that
is
required
in
the
calculus
in
the
district
court.
in
fact,
that
would
make
mandatory
what
the
sec
rules
only
make
discretionary.
chief
justice,
you
asked
earlier
about
the
sec's
rules
in
this
area.
and
in
fact,
they
compel
disclosure
of
fees
charged
by
advisers
to
their
funds
and
their
conflicts
of
similar
investment
objectives.
they
do
not
require
disclosure
of
accounts
within
an
advisor's
business
operations
that
are
institutional
accounts.
now
to
be
sure--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--that
are
--
advisers
--
institutional
accounts
adviser
services.
if--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case
the
trustees
did
have
the
information.
the
adviser
did
disclose
it,
but
the
sec
does
not
require
them
to
ask
that
question.
all
it
requires
them
to
do
is
if
they
do
ask
the
question,
if
they
do
study
the
material,
they
must
disclose
the
weight
they
put
on
to
it.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
it
could
be,
sure.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
and
the
trustees
did
ask
it
here.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
justice
breyer--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--there
is
no
problem
with
saying
that
if
it
is
a
relevant
consideration.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
the
solicitor
general
and
the
plaintiffs
would
make
the
question
and
the
answer
dispositive
in
every
case.
i
would
acknowledge
as--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--precisely.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
it
is
a
factor
that
i
consider
that
is
likely
to
be
relevant--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--my
objection
--
my
objection
to
sending
it
back
is
only
that
that
analysis
was
done.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
made
that
comparison.
judge
easterbrook
did
say
that
the
services
of
institutional
accounts
ordinarily
are
different
from
mutual
fund
accounts.
i
agree
that
in
the
first
instance,
the
first
comparator
usually
should
be
mutual
funds,
and
regrettably
judge
easterbrook
did
not
cite
to
the
record
for
the
reasons
to
identify
those
differences.
but
it
is
in
fact
in
the
record,
and
there
is
no
other
record
that
suggests
that
they
were
the
same.
all
we
had
below
was
the
assertion
that
on
the
one
hand,
an
advisory
contract
for
an
institutional
account
said
advisory
services.
and
in
the
other
we
had
a
mutual
fund
advisory
contract
that
said
advisory
services.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
i
look
at
it
in
the
gartenberg
sense,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
because
as
i
--
from
what
i
said
the
first
question
is,
is
when
do
you
ask
courts
to
substitute
their
judgment?
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
i
believe
they
interpret
in
the
gartenberg
sense.
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general's
position
and
the
respondent's,
with
respect
to
the
standard
that
you
ought
to
apply,
is
gartenberg.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
i
agree
you
can
turn
the
words
upside
down.
i
think
they
turned
it
upside
down--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--i
think
they
turned
them
upside
down
for
a
reason,
and
the
reason
is
36(b)(1),
which
imposes
the
burden
of
proof
upon--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--i
would
accept
the
proposition
that
it
is
reasonable
if
it
is
outside
of
what
could
have
been
bargained
at
arm's
length.
i
think
they
turned
it
upside
down
the
fact
for
the
reason
that
the
statute
reverses
the
burden
of
proof
and
i
think
that
they
also
acknowledge
that
it
is
a
process-oriented
thing
for
judges
to
do,
because
after
all
you
are
asking
here
a
standard
for
judges
to
apply
in
a
contested
situation
that
recognizes
the
responsibility
of
the
board
in
the
first
instance.
that's
what
36(b)(2)
is
all
about.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
start
at
page
16a
and
17a
of
the
district
court's
opinion
where
at
page
16a
at
the
bottom
the
district
court
said
the
services
supplied
are
different.
and--
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
the
petition.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
correct,
it's
16a
of
the
petition,
which
is
judge
kocoras'
opinion.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
you
will
see
that
he
said,
the
services
harris
provided
to
institutional
clients
varied
but
in
all
events
were
more
limited
than
those
provided
the
funds.
if
you
then
go
on
to
page
17,
he
goes
through
with
respect
to
each
of
these
three
funds
and
chronicles
the
fees
they
paid
and
by
comparison
the
fees
charged
to
institutional
accounts
with
similar
investment
objectives.
the
statement
by
the
plaintiff,
petitioners
here,
that
the
fee
charged
was
a
2x
multiple,
does
not
refer
to
that
array
of
institutional
accounts.
it
takes
one
in
order
to
make
the
comparison
what
it
is.
and
then,
justice
scalia,
i
would
then
go
to
page
32a
of
the
district
court's
opinion
where
he
describes
what
appear
to
be
disputed
issues
of
fact.
and
what
he
said
those
dispute
issues
of
fact
were
about
were
what
the
petitioners
claimed
were
flaws
in
the
negotiation
process,
in
substance,
what
they
would
have
done
had
they
been
negotiating,
rather
than
the
trustees.
it
is
not
a
dispute
about
the
ultimate
test,
was
this
fee
so
far
out
of
bounds
it
could
not
have
been
reasonable.
to
be
sure,
throughout
a
record
that
is
as
large
as
this
one,
you
could
imagine
the
parties
disputed
lots
of
things.
what
you
could
not
fairly
dispute
is
whether
these
fees,
for
these
funds,
using
comparable
funds
and
using
institutional
accounts,
as
judge
kocoras
did,
were
so
far
out
of
bounds,
they
could
not
have
been
fairly
bargained,
and
if
that
is
the
test,
there
is
no
need
for
remand.
if,
as
i
suggest
and
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests,
gartenberg
is
the
appropriate
standard,
gartenberg
is
what
the
district
court
applied.
this
court
has
to
be
sure,
on
occasion,
and
it
is
rare,
both
announce
the
test
and
apply
it
in
the
same
circumstances.
in
circumstances
where
courts
are
looking
for
guidance
on
what
the
standard
is
and
how
to
apply
it,
i
suggest
this
is
a
case
in
which
affirming
what
the
district
court
did
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
john
d.
donovan
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
and,
again,
i
would
go
back
to
what
judge
kocoras
said
on
32(a).
there
was
absolutely
suggestions
in
the
record
by
the
plaintiff
that
they
would
have
negotiated
differently,
but,
for
example,
with
respect
to
ostensible
misrepresentations
on
--
among
other
things,
profitability
and
the
rest,
this
was
because
the
plaintiffs'
expert
did
an
accounting
and
accounted
for
costs
differently
and
said,
had
you
accounted
for
costs
and
allocated
them
the
way
i
did,
you
would
have
reached
a
negotiated
result
that
was
different.
well,
that
just
isn't
what
happened.
that's
why
judge
kocoras
said,
this
goes
to
the
integrity
of
the
negotiation.
would
the
negotiation
have
been
different?
the
plaintiffs
say,
i
would
have
done
it
differently,
but
that's
all
they
said,
and
it's
not
a
misrepresentation
to
say,
i
would
have
accounted
for
costs
differently.
finally,
i
would
--
the
other
question
you
asked
is
where
in
the
record
--
justice
scalia,
i'm
sorry.
it's
at
page
161
and
following,
where
the
background
of
all
the
difference
in
fees
and
the
difference
in
services
is
chronicled.
you
can
tell,
from
the
pull-out
charts
at
page
171,
what
fee
is
charged
for
each
of
these
mutual
funds
and
what
fee
is
charged
for
institutional
accounts.
if
you
take
the
plaintiffs'
point
of
view
and
say
that
a
comparison
to
institutional
accounts
is
always
required
and
may
be
dispositive
and
is
always
a
fraction
of
what
mutual
fund
charges
and
that
judges
are
the,
in
the
first
instance,
the
ones
to
decide
who
is
fair
and
reasonable
or
what
is
fair
and
reasonable,
as
opposed
to
directors,
i
suggest
you
consign
8,000
mutual
funds
to
a
trial.
on
this
record,
these
were
funds
that
had
best
in
class
performance
for
fees
that
were
at
or
below
industry
averages.
that
is
not
a
record
upon
which
a
reasonable
person
could
conclude
that
the
adviser
has
over-reached.
that
is
at
the
heart
of
fiduciary
duty.
i
see
my
time
is
about
to
expire.
thank
you,
your
honor.
