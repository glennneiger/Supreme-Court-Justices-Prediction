justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
were
appointed
to
a
committee,
just
set
my
pay,
that
might
be
helpful.
i'd
say
i'll
pay
you
$50,000
a
year
to
do
it,
as
long
as
i
am
satisfied
with
your
results.
now,
would
you,
for
example,
not
have
in
your
mind,
i
would
like
to
know
what
he's
paid
by
other
people
that
don't
have
someone
like
me
setting
his
pay?
wouldn't
that
be
in
your
mind?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
so
wouldn't
that
be
a
normal
question
to
ask?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know
if
they
asked
it
--
i
mean,
i
think
we
are
reviewing
the
district
court
opinion,
i
think
we
are
reversing
--
we
are
reviewing
--
sorry.
we're
reviewing.
[laughter]
i
have
laryngitis;
i
don't
speak
accurately.
i
think
we
are
reviewing
a
--
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
setting
a
standard,
and
so
wouldn't,
when
we
set
the
standard,
say,
we
can't
say
if
in
every
case
you
are
not
going
to
go
out
and
ask
him
what
he
charges
when
he
mows
the
neighbor's
lawn,
but
we
would
like
to
know
what
he
charges
when
he
asks
for
money
from
people
who
do
not
have
this
kind
of
supervision,
and
we
would
like
if
it's
a
lot
different
to
ask
him
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
what's
the
problem
then
with
saying
that
in
the
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
pretty
unusual
that
it
won't
be,
and
i
think
certainly
you
have
in
the
case
in
front
of
us
a
case
where
it
would
be
relevant.
you
may
have
an
answer
to
the
question.
there
may
be
a
perfectly
good
answer,
so
let's
listen
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
dispositive?
well,
i
don't
see
it
should
be
dispositive,
maybe
the
answers
would
be
quite
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
--
but
you
no
objection,
then
i'm
not
sure
there
is
much
of
an
issue.
there
might
--
i
mean,
maybe
there
is
some.
that's
the
only
issue,
whether
this
should
be
dispositive
always,
or
whether
it
should
be
a
factor
to
take
into
account
where
relevant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
have
no
objection
to
send
it
back
and
say
look,
of
course
this
is
relevant,
perhaps
quite
often
relevant;
why
don't
you
look
at
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
do
about
gartenberg?
that
is
to
say,
the
key
sentence
you
can
read
either
way.
the
key
sentence
could
mean
--
it
just
depends
on
tone
of
voice.
you
must
charge
a
fee
that
is
not
so
disproportionately
large
that
it
bears
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
services
rendered
and
could
not
--
could
not
have
been
the
product
of
arms-length
bargaining.
or
you
could
say,
look,
it's
unlawful
where
it's
so
large
--
it
doesn't
--
where
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship.
and
if
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship,
how
could
it
have
been
the
product
of
arm's-length
bargaining?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
object
if
we
turn
them
upside
down?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
saying
the
tone,
be
a
little
careful
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
can
say
the
substance
is
--
i'm
just
trying
this
out
--
the
substance
is
to
look
and
see
if
it's
reasonable,
and
if
it's
reasonable
it
certainly
is
the
product
of
arm-length
bargaining,
if
it's
not
reasonable,
how
could
it
be?
got
to
get
an
answer
to
that,
okay?
so,
that
way
you
see
the
tone
is
be
careful,
you
are
a
judge,
you
are
not
a
rate-setter.
how's
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought,
by
reversing
that,
picking
out
what
the
essence
was,
you
would
get
pretty
close
to
what
you
are
arguing
for,
without
getting
into
all
this
thing
of
whether
it's
just
like
a
trustee
or
whether
a
lawyer
should
be
a
trustee
or
--
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
here
that
could
float
around,
of
any
language
we
use.
