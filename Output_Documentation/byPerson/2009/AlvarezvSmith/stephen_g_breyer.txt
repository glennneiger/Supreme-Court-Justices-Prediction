justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
he
was
just
talking
about
probable
cause.
how
could
that
be
duplicative?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
i
thought
this
case,
though
i
grant
you
i
could
well
be
wrong,
is
not
about
a
final
forfeiture
hearing
where
you
have
to
show
that
it's
more
probable
than
not
that
the
car
was
used
for
drugs.
but
under
the
illinois
law,
just
as
justice
alito
said,
you
can
seize
a
car
without
a
warrant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
are
lists
of
circumstances.
but
in
the
florida
statute
that
justice
thomas
wrote
about,
it
said
that
a
person
whose
car
it
is,
is
entitled
to
a
hearing,
i
thought,
in
a
brief
time
to
see
if
there
was
probable
cause,
just
as
a
person
arrested.
you
have
to
bring
them
before
a
magistrate
within
a
short
time
to
see
if
there's
probable
cause.
now,
how
do
you
do
that
in
chicago?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
the
answer
to
the
question
is
there
is
no
way?
a
person
who
doubts
this
probable
cause
has
no
way.
he
has
to
wait
6
months
until
there's
a
forfeiture
hearing.
he's
out
of
luck
because
then
it
merges
with
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
your
answer.
there
is
no
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
don't
see
why
you
win
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
there
a
way
or
not?
you
have
pointed
to
three
statutes.
do
they
give
him
any
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
that
what
is
--
what
is
the
rationale
your
supporting
it
for
the
following:
my
car
was
parked
on
the
street.
there
happened
to
be
some
big
drug
crime
nearby,
and
the
policeman
took
my
car.
in
my
opinion,
there
was
no
probable
cause.
i
would
like
my
car
back.
now,
i
take
it
that
in
illinois
there
is
no
proceeding,
as
there
was
in
florida,
so
that
i
can
claim
there
was
no
probable
cause,
and
i
--
none
at
all.
i
never
get
that
determination
made;
and,
moreover,
i
have
to
wait,
for
6
months
possibly,
before
i
get
a
different
determination
made,
which
is
whether
they
had
--
more
likely
than
not,
whether
that's
entitled
to
forfeiture
on
the
merit.
is
that
the
law?
if
anything
like
it
is
the
law,
what's
the
constitutional
justification
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
they
can
keep
my
car
even
if
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
it
was
never
involved?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
still
--
okay,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
that
is
--
all
right.
that's
a
burden
of
proof
thing
at
the
final
thing.
that's
not
the
thrust
of
my
question.
the
thrust
of
my
question
is:
do
i
have
to
wait
for
up
to
6
months
before
i
have
any
magistrate,
any
neutral
official,
pass
on
my
claim
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
take
my
car?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
florida
statute,
by
the
way,
doesn't
do
that.
it
says
of
course
you
get
a
hearing
on
probable
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
nobody
gives
you
--
they
go
around
taking
cars
even
without
probable
cause.
there's
no
way
to
do
--
it
happens
in
every
state.
what's
the
constitutional
justification
for
making
a
person
wait
for
6
months
before
he
gets
a
neutral
judicial
official
to
say
whether
there
was
even
cause
to
take
his
car?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
i
have
a
different
position,
which
is
i'd
like
to
see
if
it's
practical
to
decide
this
case
now,
two
things
stand
in
the
way
in
my
mind
which
i'd
like
you
to
address.
the
first
is
your
opponents
are
saying,
no,
you
shouldn't
really
address
this
issue
now
because
there
are
three
illinois
statutes
which
actually
give
them,
anyone
who
wants
it,
a
right
to
a
hearing
at
least
on
probable
cause.
and
that's
a
matter
of
illinois
law.
and
although
the
statutes
don't
seem
to
say
it,
they
might.
and
the
second
is
that
this
seems
mixed
up
in
my
mind
--
not
necessarily
your
fault;
it
may
be
my
mind
--
but
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
quite
separate
questions:
when
you
are
entitled
to
a
final
hearing
of
whether
forfeiture
is
right
or
wrong;
and
whether
you
are
entitled
to
a
preliminary
hearing
on
whether
there
was
probable
cause
under
the
statute
to
obtain
the
car.
now,
that
latter
question
i
think
might
be
impractical
in
many
cases
to
work
out
until
there's
been
a
trial
of
an
individual
who's
accused
of
a
crime,
which
may
be
much
later.
but
the
former
question
is
where
i
think
you
have
a
point,
that
there
are
five
instances
here
in
this
statute
where
a
policeman
could
seize
a
car
without
a
warrant
and
he
has
to
have
probable
cause
under
most
of
them
nonetheless.
so
your
clients
might
say:
he
did
not
have
probable
cause;
i
want
a
neutral
magistrate
to
contest
it.
now,
in
my
mind
that
reaches
--
that's
a
different
question
than
the
final
hearing
about
who's
entitled
to
the
car.
and
i
also
see
the
three
statutes
and
now
i
see
a
case
where
here
in
front
of
me
everything
is
mixed
up.
so
i
think
--
perhaps
i'm
just
seeing
it
that
way,
but
those
issues
are
mixed
up
confused
and
not
separated
out.
so
why
don't
we
wait?
what's
your
answer
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
can
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--go
ahead.
finish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
can
i
get
to
the
merits
for
a
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
back
to
what
justice
alito
and
justice
sotomayor
were
asking.
this
statute
gives
a
policeman
the
right
to
seize
some
property
without
a
warrant
if
it's
a
circumstance
where
you
could
seize
a
person
without
a
warrant.
that's
basically
what
it
says,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
in
that
kind
of
situation,
i
would
think
maybe
you
are
entitled
to
a
quick
hearing
where
the
only
subject
would
be:
was
that
language
carried
out?
was
that
policeman
right?
was
there
probable
cause,
or
wasn't
there?
now,
if
that's
the
issue,
i
don't
see
why
you
give
up
at
all
on
the
baseball
card.
i
mean,
if
somebody
comes
into
my
house
and
takes
a
baseball
card,
and
he's
supposed
to
have
probable
cause
and
he
doesn't,
i
don't
see
why
i
can't
go
get
a
judge
or
a
magistrate,
determine
whether
he
had
at
my
baseball
card,
and
pretty
quickly,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
you
go
to
the
other--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you
go
to
the
other,
which
is
whether
there's
an
innocent
owner
or
whether
in
fact
you
should
give
bail
to
the
property
--
i
mean,
that's
--
i
know
we
give
bail
to
people,
but
i
don't
know
that
we
give
bail
to
property.
maybe
real
property,
but
that
seems
a
much
more
complex
argument.
so
i
want
to
know:
what's
your
authority
that
we
should
give
bail
to
the
property
and
have
a
hearing
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
do
you
give
up
in
respect
to
baseball
cards
or
anything
in
effect
to
the
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
illinois
law
and
certain
circumstances,
the
police
can
seize
a
car
or
cash
without
a
warrant;
i
suppose
they
were
arresting
somebody
and
they
didn't
have
time
to
get
the
warrant.
now
the
question
in
this
case
was,
whether
illinois
law
provides
such
a
person
with
a
sufficiently
speedy
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing,
so
he
could
contest
that
the
law
--
that
he
--
that
it
was
an
unlawful
seizure.
well
when
oral
argument
was
taking
place
here,
we
learned
that
all
the
real
arguments
between
the
parties
have
ended.
the
state
returned
the
cars.
the
disputes
over
the
cash
had
been
settled.
the
case
was
not
a
damages
case,
not
ongoing.
it
wasn't
a
class
action.
it
didn't
involve
the
kind
of
threat
of
repetitive
action
that
might
evade
review.
so
we
have
to
say
there
is
no
continuing
controversy
and
have
to
conclude
that
the
case
was
moot.
now
there
is
still
an
issue,
because
ordinarily
when
a
case
is
moot
what
we
do
is
we
order
the
judgment
below
vacated
and
we
remand
the
case
to
the
lower
court
with
instructions
to
dismiss.
but
there
was
a
question
here
because
in
a
case
called
bankcorp,
we
said
we'd
let
that
lower
court
judgment
stand,
we
wouldn't
vacate
it.
when
the
mootness
occurred
because
the
parties
settled
the
underlying
case,
we
thought
it
seemed
somewhat
unfair
to
permit
a
party
to
moot
a
case,
say
deliberately
or
intentionally
just
by
settling
it
to
avoid
our
decision,
understandable
but
we
did
it,
but
sometimes,
but
here
however
the
termination
of
respondent's
underlying
forfeiture
case
in
the
state
courts
were
not
really
settlements
as
the
case
bankcorp
meant
to
use
that
term.
we
explain
in
our
opinion
that
the
termination
of
those
forfeiture
cases
seem
to
have
nothing
to
do
or
very
little
to
do
with
any
effort
to
avoid
a
decision
here
so
we
ended
up
saying
we
will
follow
our
ordinary
practice.
we
vacate
the
judgment
below.
we
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
case.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
