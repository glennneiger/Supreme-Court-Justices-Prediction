mr.
castiglione,
you
have
been
asked
to
address
the
mootness
question
--
both
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
forfeiture
proceedings
occurred
in
the
plaintiffs'
cases?
is
there
any
lingering
question
concerning
the
status
of
the
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
concluded?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
were
no
damage
claims
when
the
final
judgment
was
entered
in
the
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
a
final
judgment,
and
it
went
up
on
appeal.
and
at
what
point
did
they
seek
to
--
i
mean,
while
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
final
judgment
dismissing
the
case,
there
was
nothing
for
the
district
judge
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
did
not
ask
for
damages
originally.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
we
have
a
district
court
final
judgment
dismissing
the
case.
the
case
was
only
for
injunctive
relief.
it
goes
to
the
seventh
circuit.
it's
in
that
shape.
we
are
taking
the
case
from
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
been
there
originally,
but
the
problem
is
it
wasn't
there.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
complaint
that
is
simply
for
injunctive
relief.
and
that
is
moot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
plaintiffs
--
the
plaintiffs
didn't
appeal
the
denial
of
certification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
we
should
--
we
should
ask
the
plaintiffs
about
that.
but
you're
saying
that
the
two
cases
that
were
defaulted
are
not
moot?
isn't
a
default
the
end
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
in
your
opening
that
there
is
just
the
one
proceeding,
and
that's
the
petition
for
forfeiture.
but
in
your
brief
you
suggested
that
there
is
a
means
that
these
plaintiffs
could
get
back
their
property
pending
the
ultimate
forfeiture
proceeding.
you
mentioned
a
slocum
type
hearing,
a
petition
for
return
of
their
property.
so
i
don't
understand
your
argument
that
there's
one
and
only
procedure,
the
forfeiture
procedure,
when
on
the
other
hand
you
are
telling
us
that
there
is
a
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
get
an
expedited
hearing?
i
thought
--
i
thought
for
property
under
20,000,
the
state
--
the
time
before
the
forfeiture
proceeding
could
be
187
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
bond
is
for
costs,
not
to
get
your
car
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
--
is
there
any
procedure
for
putting
up
a
bond
for
the
car
so
you
can
get
the
car
back,
for
the
full
value
of
the
car?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
--
there's
no
hardship
under
the
illinois
statute?
there
is
no
provision
comparable
to
the
federal
legislation
for
hardship,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
peters,
i
think
the
court
in
geraghty
said
it
split
the
interests.
and
they
said
his
interests
in
challenging
the
denial
of
class
action
status
continued
even
though
he
was
no
longer
incarcerated.
so
they
were
concentrating
on
his
right
to
appeal
the
denial
of
class
action
certification.
and
that's
what
you
don't
have
here.
and
that's
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
geraghty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
must
take
it
as
it
came
into
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
no
appeal
from
the
denial
of
class
certification.
so
we
have
individual
plaintiffs
who
are
seeking
to
overturn
the
denial
of
injunctive
relief.
and
that's
all
that's
before
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
--
i
thought
the
government
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
cash.
so
that
--
which
we
are
told
is
85
percent
of
the
seizures
involved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
one
of
the
problems
with
the
seventh
circuit
decision?
that
it
covers
the
waterfront.
it
covers
cash,
as
well
as
any
property.
it's
not
concentrated
on
cars.
and
what
your
complaint
asks
for
--
you
said
it
was
as
applied,
but
you
are
asking
for
a
declaration
that
defendants
must
hold
a
post-seizure
probable
cause
hearing
within
10
business
days,
and
you
are
asking
the
court
to
enjoin
the
defendant's
current
practice
of
seizing
property
and
retaining
custody
without
a
judicial
determination
of
probable
cause.
that
sounds,
to
me,
like
a
facial
challenge
to
this
statute,
and
you
are
asking
for
a
declaration
that
the
statute
is
invalid,
not
as
applied
to
any
particular
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
--
where
does
the
seventh
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
where
you
said
--
you
said
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
seventh
circuit
--
your
complaint,
you
say,
is
--
you
asked
for
the
universe,
every
kind
of
property
of
due
process
hearing
within
10
days
or
a
short
period.
but
you
said
the
seventh
circuit
narrowed
the
relief.
and
i'm
looking
at
the
seventh
circuit
decision,
and
i
really
don't
see
what
was
narrowed.
i
think
they
left
everything
open
for
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
--
where
is
there
any
narrowing?
