justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
has
there
ever
been
a
case
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
merits
of
a
dispute
where
the
individual
claims
of
the
named
plaintiffs
expired
before
we
heard
argument
and
a
--
and
a
class
had
not
yet
been
certified?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
the
class
has
not
yet
been
certified,
has
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
--
the
claims
of
all
the
named
plaintiffs
are
--
have
expired?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
ask
you
this
about
the
government's
interest
involved
here
and
the
practicality
of
the
situation,
and
i
want
to
put
aside
the
innocent
owner
defense,
which
i
hope
to
ask
your
adversary
about.
but
putting
that
aside,
let's
take
what
i
envision
as
sort
of
the
typical
case
where
the
police
officer
arrests
someone
in
a
vehicle
for
a
drug
offense
and
--
without
a
warrant
--
and
then
has
to
file
a
complaint
in
court.
what
--
what
is
the
government
--
what
is
the
burden
on
the
government,
and
what
would
be
the
burden
on
chicago
or
the
state
of
illinois
in
a
requirement
that
within
some
reasonably
brief
period
of
time
after
that
that
there
must
be
the
equivalent
of
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
court,
just
as
you
would
for
the
arrest
of
an
individual
without
a
warrant,
where
the
only
issue
would
be
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
seizure,
not
whether
there,
you
know,
is
some
innocent
owner
defense,
but
just
whether
there's
probable
cause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--exactly
what
you
think
needs
to
take
place
at
this
hearing?
and
the
hearing
you
think
has
to
take
place
within
10
days?
is
that
your
figure?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
whatever
the
period
is:
10
days,
14
days,
whatever.
some
short
period.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
have
two
questions:
must
it
be
an
adversarial
hearing,
and
must
the
state
disprove
the
innocent
owner
defense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
but
my
understanding
of
krimstock
is
that
a
lot
of
those
seizures
--
and
others
know
more
about
this
than
i
do
--
were
for
dwi,
and
that
it
is
possible
to
assert
an
innocent
owner
defense
there.
and
that's
where
i
see
a
great
impracticality
in
this.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
expect
the
state
to
come
into
court
within
such
a
short
period
and
have
any
burden
of
contesting
an
innocent
owner
defense
without
compromising
a
criminal
investigation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
this
example
which
is
pretty
much
based
on
something
that
you
--
you
wrote
in
your
own
brief.
joe
is
arrested
on
a
drug
offense
driving
a
car,
and
there
are
drugs
in
the
car.
but
joe
isn't
the
owner
of
the
car;
john
is
the
owner
of
the
car.
then
john
comes
in
10
days
later
or
14
days
later
and
says,
well,
you
know,
i
never
had
any
inkling
that
joe
was
using
the
car
to
deal
in
drugs
and
had
no
reason
to
know
that.
and
you
think
that
within
that
short
period
of
time
the
state
has
to
disprove
that,
you
know,
that
john
didn't
have--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--reason
to
believe
that
joe
was
involved
in
drug
dealing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
situation
is
much
worse
than
that,
that
they
don't
have
the
--
that
they
need
time
to
investigate.
they
may
have
the
registered
owner
under
investigation.
they
may
think
he
is
involved
in
the
drug
conspiracy
as
well.
they
may
have
him
on
wiretaps.
they
may
be
preparing
to
arrest
him.
now,
you
want
to
force
them
to
come
into
court
within
10
or
14
days
and
disclose
the
details
of
a
--
of
a
pending
criminal
investigation
and
prepare
to
--
that
makes
a
great--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
then
i
don't
understand
how
this
--
how
you
can
possibly
have
the
innocent
owner
issue
adjudicated
at
this
quick
hearing.
i
can
understand
the
argument
that
you
have
to
have
the
filing
of
the
equivalent
of
a
--
of
a
complaint
when
you
--
that
has
to
be
filed
when
someone
is
arrested
without
a
warrant,
where
it's
not
adversarial
and
you
establish
probable
cause
for
the
seizure.
but
when
you
start
to
go
beyond
that
in
drug
forfeiture
cases,
at
least,
not
--
not
dwi
cases,
i
just
don't
see
how
that's
workable.
