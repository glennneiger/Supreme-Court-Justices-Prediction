is
there
any
other
area
--
is
there
any
other
area
of
law
where
we
permit
a
prejudgment
attachment
and/or
seizure
of
property
without
a
neutral
magistrate
reviewing
the
reason
for
that
seizure?
we
don't
permit
a
pretrial
attachment,
do
we,
except
in
some
narrow
circumstances?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
don't
deny
that
there's
a
state
interest.
the
question
is
who
tests
that
interest?
in
what
time
frame?
meaning
you
can
assert
an
interest,
but
someone
has
to
determine
whether
it
really
exists
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
am
i
forgetting,
but
didn't
this
start
out
as
a
class
action
and
wasn't
the
claim
--
wasn't
the
class
action
denied?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you
didn't
appeal
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
did
the
illinois
court
do?
didn't
it
remand
for
an
appropriate
hearing
to
be
given?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
you
take
the
car
and
then
you
investigate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but
you
are
--
but
you're
sort
of
begging
the
question.
you
are
saying
to
me
that
initial
period
is
for
the
government
to
figure
out
if
it
made
a
mistake
or
not,
and
we're
entitled
to
that
time.
you're
not
entitled,
meaning
you,
property
owner,
to
go
to
a
neutral
magistrate
who
will
make
that
decision
without
a
personal
interest
in
the
outcome,
because
the
person
who
seized
does
have
an
interest
of
some
sort.
many
local
police
departments
do
in
seizing
property,
because
they
keep
the
proceeds.
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
constitutionally
it's
okay
for
the
party
holding
on
to
property
without
a
warrant
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
wants
to
give
something
back,
whether
or
not
there's
--
there's
a
viable
defense.
i'm
a
little
confused.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
it
wasn't.
the
appeal
in
geraghty
included
an
appeal
of
the
denial
of
class
certification.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
both
issues
--
both
the
merits
and
the
denial
of
the
class
certification
--
were
still
active
before
the
court.
here
you
didn't
appeal
the
dismissal
of
the
class
certification
or
the
mootness
of
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but
in
many
appeals
parties
plead
in
the
alternative
and
say,
if
you
--
if
we
win
on
the
merits,
reverse
the
dismissal
of
the
class
certification
because
we
still
want
to
proceed
as
a
class.
you
didn't
do
that.
you
waited
for
the
merits
to
be
adjudicated
and
then
filed
a
new
class
action.
it's
a
very
different
procedural
step.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
can
you
unpackage
for
me
this
hearing?
because
there
is
a
confusion
in
it
that
appears,
both
in
your
papers
and
in
this
argument.
there's
a
probable
cause
component,
which
is
the
police
coming
before
a
neutral
magistrate
and
saying,
this
is
the
reason
i
seized;
i
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
car
was
involved
in
an
illegal
activity,
and
this
is
why.
and
then
there
is
what
sounds
like,
to
me,
a
sort
of
remission-type
component
to
the
hearing
you
are
looking
at,
which
is
a
magistrate
saying,
okay,
you
have
probable
cause,
but
there's
no
reason
for
the
seizing
authorities
to
keep
the
car
because
you
can
post
a
bond
instead,
or
something
else
should
be
done
to
mitigate
the
damage
to
you
during
this
process
of
forfeiture.
am
i
correct
that
there
are
two
components
to
your
request?
and
if
there
are,
i
understand
the
probable
cause
component,
but
i'm
not
sure
how
you
get
to
the
second
component
of
how
and
why
due
process
would
require
the
state
to
have
a
--
i'm
calling
it
remission
--
but
a
remission-like
proceeding?
am
i
correct?
am
i
understanding
what
--
what
it
is
you're--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
just
get
clarification?
under
your
state
law,
there
is
no
way
for
an
owner
to
come
in
and
challenge
probable
cause
to
seize?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
a
defense--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
the
examples
judge
breyer
said:
my
car
was
just
sitting
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
and,
second,
is
there
any
procedure
under
your
state
law
to
do
the
second
half
of
what
your
adversary
said
he
was
looking
for,
a
remission-type
proceeding
that
would
balance
the
government's
need
to
hold
the
property
and
the
individual's
need
for
it,
and
whether
there
is
a
bond
that
could
be
posted
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
may
be
part
of
the
mathews
issue,
that
once
you
prove
probable
cause,
giving
away
--
giving
back
money
just
never
would
probably
be
rational
to
hold
a
hearing
about,
but
that
might
not
be
true
for
real
property,
correct?
under
--
even
under
mathews,
under
--
in
a
mathews
analysis.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
apply
a
mathews
analysis--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
multifaceted
item
would
say
for
the
seizure
of
cash,
maybe
only
the
hearing
has
to
address
probable
cause,
but
for
real
property
it
has
to
go
further.
not
real
property,
in
the
sense
of
real
personal
property.
it
has
to
go
further,
because
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
individual,
pending--
