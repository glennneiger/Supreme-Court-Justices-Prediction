chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-351,
alvarez
v.
smith.
mr.
castiglione.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
suppose,
if
the
case
is
moot,
then
you
are
entitled
to
a
munsingwear
order.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there's
no
controlling
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
i
suppose
the
district
court
doesn't
know
whether
to
award
damages
or
not
until
it
gets
a
final
decision
from
--
or
a
decision
from
the
seventh
circuit
or
this
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
surely
your
position
is
going
to
be
that
the
statutory
procedure
pre-empts
and
takes
the
place
of
any
slocum
hearing,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
somebody
comes
in
and
files
a
petition
saying,
here
i'm
raising
this
right
under,
you
know,
an
early
19th
century
procedure,
and
you're
not
going
to
say,
okay,
here's
our
position
or
here's
the
property.
you
are
going
to
say,
wait
until
the
forfeiture
proceeding
that
is
provided
under
illinois
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
slocum
then
is
the
answer
to
a
very
different
case.
it's
a
case
where
you
have
a
class
action
of
people
whose
cases
fell
through
the
cracks
and
never
got
the
procedures
they
were
entitled
to.
it
doesn't
seem
at
all
responsive
to
the
claim
that
they
are
entitled
to
procedures
before
it
falls
through
the
cracks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
afford
you
additional
time
because
the
court's
questions
have
intruded
upon
your
rebuttal
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
you'd
begin
with
the
mootness
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
peters.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
then
if
it's
--
if
it's
money
that
is
being
conditionally
released,
there's
no
security
for
the
government.
if
it
turns
out
later
on
it
shouldn't
have
been
released,
it's
probably
gone.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
at
your
innocent
owner
or
the
hearing
that
you
are
seeking,
you
establish,
well,
i
was
going
to
sell
my
baseball
card
to
give
me
the
money
to
--
to
survive,
to
get
food?
that
was
my
--
i
mean,
what
happens
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
just
to
get
back
to
the
cars,
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
alito
was
a
little
abstract.
in
the
absolute
concrete
case,
where
the
drug
--
the
suspect
is
driving
the
car,
there
are
drugs
in
the
car.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
your
hearing,
the
--
it's
not
registered
to
him.
the
registered
owner
comes
in
and
says,
that's
my
car,
i
had
no
idea
it
was
being
used
for
drugs.
who
wins,
the
state
or
the
registered
owner?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
aren't
they
always
going
to
say
that?
they
are
going
to
say,
well,
we
don't
know
if
the
registered
owner
is
involved
in
the
drug
conspiracy.
we
don't
know
how
closely
he
is
tied
with
the
owner,
so
it's
reasonable
to
assume
he
knew
what
was
going
on,
and
besides,
we've
got
a
lot
of
other
bigger
fish
to
fry
during
this
period.
we
are
trying
to
find
out
the
scope
of
the
conspiracy.
we
are
trying
to
find
out
where
the
sales
were
going
to
take
place.
why
do
you
force
us
to
--
to
focus
our
energies
on
the
relationship
between
a
registered
owner
and
the
guy
driving
the
car?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
as
--
so
it's
as
applied
in
every
case,
which
i
think
ties
in
a
little
bit
to
the
mootness
question
that
we
began
with.
because
it
focuses
on
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
claimants,
and
if
the
individual
claimants
have
already
had
their
property
returned,
i
think
it
accentuates
the
mootness
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
an
interesting
--
that's
an
interesting
question.
i
mean,
is
it
becoming
moot
through
their
voluntary
cessation
or
activity
when
the
state
law
requires
them
to
take
particular
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
castiglione,
why
don't
you
take
3
minutes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
answer
is
that
they
didn't
all
settle.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
08-351,
alvarez
versus
smith.
