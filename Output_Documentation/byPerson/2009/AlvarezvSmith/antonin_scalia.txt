justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
granted
then,
and
it
still
hasn't
been
granted.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
nobody
before
this
court
with
a
live
claim,
neither
the
original
named
plaintiffs
nor
a
certified
class.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
who's
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
were
they
seeking
to
have
enjoined?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
i
--
since
they
defaulted
in
the
--
in
the
final
hearing,
how
can
--
can
they
possibly
have
any
claim
left
with
regard
to
an
interim
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
--
and
they
can
do
that
before
the
--
before
the
time
period
has
expired?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
is
a
dead
letter
if
you
allow
a
slocum
action.
all
you
--
all
you
need
is
a
slocum
action,
and
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
you
have
to
wait
for
--
you
know,
that
the
government
has
40
days,
is
meaningless.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
it's
a
way
of
defeating
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
statute
says
the
government
isn't
dilatory
until
--
until
the
time
period,
40
days.
it
has
40
days.
what
does
that
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
has
40
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
the
40
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
well,
that's
a
different
story.
these
people
are
asking
for
a
hearing
before
the
elapsing
of
the
40
days,
and
if
all
--
if
all
you
say
that
slocum
provides
is
a
hearing
after
the
40
days
have
elapsed
and
nothing
has
occurred,
that
doesn't
satisfy
what
they
are
asking
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
for
40
days,
is
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
if
it
--
you
don't
dispute
that
doesn't
have
to
do
anything,
but
you
--
you
assert
that
if
it
does
nothing,
you
can
bring
a
slocum
action.
i
mean,
which
is
it?
one
or
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
ten
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
ten
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
--
you've
given
up
the
position,
then.
you've
said
time
does
matter.
so
we
are
just
arguing
over
what
the
time
is,
whether
it's
10
years,
1
year,
or
40
days,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be,
but
that's
a
different
argument.
it's
--
it's
not
an
absolute.
it's
--
we
have
to
consider
whether
the
time
period
is
reasonable,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
were
they
seeking
to
enjoin?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
a
situation
in
which
the
property
taken
is
really
essential
to
the
--
to
the
living
of
the
person
from
whom
--
who
owns
it
--
a
car
--
and
the
person
needs
a
car
to
get
to
work
every
day.
and
--
and
there
is
really
no
reason
why
the
--
why
the
government
has
to
wait
that
long.
is
there
no
procedure
by
which
he
can
say,
you
know
--
do
it
quickly.
you
don't
have
to
wait
so
long.
i'm
the
owner.
i'm
the
only
owner.
i
can
--
i
can
prove
that.
let's
have
a
quick
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
it
was
likely
to
--
these
same
named
plaintiffs
were
likely
--
likely
--
to
face
this
same
situation
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
are
relying
on
--
on,
you
know,
"capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review.
"
that's
--
that's
the
test,
whether
--
whether
indeed
these
people
stand
a
chance
of
having
the
same
thing
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
begging
the
question.
that
is,
you
are
assuming
that
the
class
is
a
valid
class.
it
hasn't
been
certified.
how
--
how
can
you
make
that
--
that
argument
when
there
is
no
class?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
an
asserted
class
on
your
part.
there's
no
class.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
it
turns
out
it
--
it
wouldn't
have
been
gratuitous.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
--
i
thought
you
said
the
innocent
owner
defense
didn't
have
to
be
inquired
into
in
the
probable
cause
here.
i
thought
that
was
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
you
want--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
that
makes
it
harder.
you're
challenging
this
--
this
statute
on
its
face,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
applied?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
how
can
you
have
an--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
can
you
have
an
as-applied
challenge
to
an
entire
class?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
--
to
--
to
have
an
as-applied
challenge,
regardless
of
whether
the
illinois
law
provides
a
--
a
remedy,
wouldn't
you
be
able
to
individually
assert
under
section
1983
unconstitutional
action?
i
mean,
isn't
there
a
federal
remedy?
if
all
you're
concerned
about
is
as-applied,
you
mean
you
are
being
treated
unconstitutionally
by
a
state
and
you
have
no
remedy?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
will
know
about
the
probable
cause
hearing
that
you
want
to
--
that
you
want
set
up,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
--
which
is
why
you
are
asking
for
a
facial
challenge.
you
want
these
hearings
in
all
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
--regardless
of
what
the
individual
circumstances
are;
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
are
the
individual
circumstances
of
all
the
other
people
in
the
class?
we
don't
know
what
they
are.
we
don't
know
whether
it's
a
car
that
has
been
taken,
money
that
has
been
taken,
whether
they
are
millionaires,
whether
they
need
the
car.
we
know
nothing
about
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
--
you
think
it's
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
everybody
who
is
not
given
this
--
this
preliminary
hearing.
that's
--
that's
what
the
complaint
says.
your
--
the
class
you
want
certified
is
the
class
of
everybody
who
has
not
been
given
a
preliminary
hearing.
i
don't
know
the
difference
between
that
and
saying
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
just
--
just
because
you
don't
say
in
your
complaint,
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
it
amounts
to
a
facial
challenge.
you
say,
everybody
who
has
not
been
given
a
preliminary
hearing
is
entitled
to
relief
because
the
statute
is
bad
as
to
all
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
the
class
you
asked
to
be
certified.
you
asked
to
certify
everybody
who
had
been
denied
a
preliminary
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
change
this
--
this
action
from
a
class
action
--
from
a
facial
challenge
into
a
nonfacial
challenge.
they
can't
change
your
complaint.
you
were
either
asking
this
to
be
struck
down
on
its
face,
or
you
weren't.
and
what
--
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
doesn't
change
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
them
are
worth--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
lot
of
money.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
"my
potential
class",
you
should
call
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
they
didn't.
i
thought
some
didn't
have
it
returned,
but
there
was
a
settlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
mootness
was
not
a
result
of
any
settlement
between
the
city
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
--
your
friend
said
the
opposite.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
got
all
of
their
property
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
understand.
they
got
their
cars
back,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
people
who
had
money
at
stake,
what
happened
to
the
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
settlement?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
at
least
one
case
where
the
mootness
is
attributable
to
a
settlement.
you
have
at
least
one
plaintiff,
and
you
can't
get
the
kind
of
remand
for
mootness
that
you
are
asking
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
don't
do
munsingwear
orders
where
--
where
the
mootness
is
a
result
of
a
settlement.
