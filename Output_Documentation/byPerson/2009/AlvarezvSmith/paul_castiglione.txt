mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
mr.
--
excuse
me.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
despite
the
holding
in
von
neumann
that
the
civil
forfeiture
hearing
itself
is
all
the
process
that
is
due
for
the
seizure
of
personal
property,
the
seventh
circuit
struck
down
illinois's
drug
asset
forfeiture
procedure
act
specifically
because
it
does
not
require
an
additional
adversarial
hearing
that
takes
place
post-seizure
but
before
the
forfeiture
hearing.
as
far
back
as
this
court's
decision
in
gelston
v.
hoyt
and
slocum
v.
mayberry,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
civil
forfeiture
hearing
itself
is
the
single
unitary
hearing,
where
all
persons
having
an
interest
in
the
property
are
present
and
the
following
questions
are
resolved:
one--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--except
in
some
narrow
circumstances,
and
i
note
--
and
certainly
in
garnishment
cases
and
in
replevin
cases
that
you
would
have
to
have
that
type
of
hearing.
but
the
interests
are
different
here.
the
state's
interests
in
the
--
in
the
seized
property
takes--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
your
honor,
historically,
that
has
always
been
at
the
civil
forfeiture
hearing,
and
that's
going
--
as
i
say,
going
back
to
gelston,
because
what
--
what
gelston
recognized
is
that--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
no
--
your
honor,
the
forfeiture
cases
have
concluded,
it's
true.
we--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--they
have
concluded.
the
--
there
are
three
--
three
of
the
respondents
sought
the
return
of
cars.
three
had
had
cash
seized.
in
the
three
car
cases,
the
cars
had
actually
been
returned.
in
two
of
the
cash
cases,
the
respondents
defaulted,
and
in
one
of
the
cash
cases,
the
--
the
state
and
the
respondent
reached
an
agreement.
so
those
cases
are
over.
but
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
this
case
is
not
moot
because,
subsequent
to
the
seventh
circuit
decision
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
filed
an
amended
motion
for
class
certification,
and
that's
at
docket
49
--
docket
number
49
of
the
northern
district
docket,
filed
on
june
19th,
2008,
specifically
asking
for
damages
and
restitution,
in
addition
to
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
that's
not
the
case
here,
your
honor.
at
least
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
respondents,
a
certain
tyhesha
brunston
--
her
forfeiture
case
ended
in
2009,
so
at
the
time
the
amended
motion
for
class
certification
was
filed
asking
for
damages
and
restitution.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
no,
it
has
not,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
the
injunctive
claims
may
have
expired,
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
two
respondents
whose
--
whose
cash
cases
were
defaulted.
but,
no,
the
damage
claims,
i
think
were--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
but
after
the
--
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
district
judge's
decision
granting
the
motion
to
dismiss,
upon
--
upon
remand,
the
plaintiffs
--
then,
at
that
point,
asked
for
a
certification
of
the
damage
class
and
a
restitution
class
and
expressly
stated
that
they
wished
to
pursue
a
claim
--
a
claim
for
damages
and
restitution
based
on--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--that's
true,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--i
would
--
well--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--for
--
for
mootness
purposes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
the
fact
that
plaintiffs
were
allowed
to
ask
for
damages
and
--
and
filed
a
pleading
asking--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--no,
they
did
not.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
i
would--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--we
would
--
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
--
whether
or
not
a
damage
claim
could
go
forward
would
depend
on
the
--
on
the
validity
of
the
seventh
circuit
decision.
and
our
view,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
--
when
--
the
--
upon
--
even
though
they
did
not
formally
amend
the
complaint
--
that's
true;
we
acknowledge
that,
but
in
the
--
in
the
motion
for
class
--
in
the
amended
motion
for
class
cert,
i
think
the
assertion
of
the
claim
for
damages,
at
least
for
mootness
purposes,
is
enough
to
give
this
court
jurisdiction
over
--
over
those
claims.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
that
--
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
two
respondents
whose
claims
defaulted,
your
honor,
in
that
it's
unclear
what
it
--
to
the
extent
they
were
seeking
the
return
of
their
property,
their
situation
has
not
changed.
their
property
never
was
returned.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
they
were
seeking,
your
honor
--
they
were
asking
the
court
to
declare
that
the
illinois
statute
was
unconstitutional
for
not
providing
an
interim
hearing,
and
an
injunction
preventing
--
preventing
illinois
from
enforcing
the
statute.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
i
just
think
the
nature
of
their
claim
hasn't
changed.
to
the
extent
they
were
seeking
the
return
of
their
property
through
such
an
injunction,
that
hasn't
changed
for
those
two
plaintiffs,
yunker
and
williams.
but
we
rest
our
--
our
response,
your
honor,
and
we
will--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--it
was
denied
as
moot,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
appeal
at
all.
the
plaintiffs
appealed
the
district
court's
order,
which
--
it
was
a
single
order
that
granted
--
i'm
sorry
--
that
granted
our
motions
to
dismiss
and
denied
plaintiffs'
motion
for
class
certification
as
moot.
that
was
the
order.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
the
two
--
well,
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
they
appealed
the
order
--
they
appealed
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
--
i'm
sorry
--
the
granting
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
i'm
saying
they
may
not
be
moot,
your
honor,
in
that
the
claim
for
relief
has
not
--
and
they
defaulted
before,
in
at
least
one
of
the
cases,
before
the
complaint
was
even
filed.
so
nothing
has
really
changed
in
the
status
of
their
case.
i
believe
mr.
williams
--
nothing
has
changed
in
his
case
from
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
maybe
i
can
explain,
and
i
think
it
also
goes
to
the
--
what
is
--
why
the
8,850
--
the
use
of
8,850
and
the
barker
speedy
trial
factors
makes
sense.
the
one
hearing
where
these
issues
are
resolved
is
a
civil
forfeiture
hearing,
it's
true.
but
i
think
what
slocum
does,
just
in
a
similar
way
to
how
speedy
trial
factors
operate,
it
gives
the
claimant
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
ask
the
court
to
tell
the
government
to
fish
or
cut
bait.
so
you
either
file
an
action
or
release
the
property.
i
think
it
operates
much
the
same
way
that
the
speedy
trial
factors
would
operate
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
they
can
certainly
do
that.
that's
a
remedy
that's
available
up
until
--
up
until
the
forfeiture
case
is
filed,
and
from
that--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
i
--
the
--
what
slocum
does,
your
honor,
we
think
--
we
believe
that
illinois
has
recognized
for
at
least
over
50
years
that
a
property
owner
has
a
common
law
right
to
come
in.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
that's
certainly
true,
your
honor,
but
that--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
slocum
i
think
is
a
way
of
getting
into
court,
getting
the
government--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
once
--
once
the
government
does
act,
your
honor,
then
at
that
point
i'd
say
if
in
fact
the
government's
being
--
once
the
government
files
a
forfeiture
action,
if
the
government's
dilatory,
there's
remedies
under
--
under
illinois
law,
our
code
of
civil
procedure,
or
even
perhaps
a
motion
to
dismiss
for--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--oh,
the
--
i
think
--
i
think
certainly,
your
honor,
the
government
does
have
the
time
periods.
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
the
government
certainly
has
the
time
periods.
but
if
the
case
were
to
somehow
to
fall
through
the
cracks
and
nothing
would
happen,
i
think
what
--
what
the
common
law
remedies
provide
is
a
safety
net
for
property
owners
to
be
able
to
get
into
court.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
no,
i
would
say
after
the
40.
i
would
say--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
i
would
say
slocum
provides
a
hearing
after
40
days,
your
honor.
i
would
say,
if
the
government
does
nothing,
it's
a
way
of
getting
into
court.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
and--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
slocum
is
an
equitable
remedy.
if
someone
can
establish
--
i
don't
think
before
the
time
has
run
out
in
our
procedures
one
could
probably
establish
that,
but
it's
possible
if
a
case
were
to
--
were
to
fall
through
the
cracks,
and
it
gives--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
the
statute
--
is
the
regime
that
illinois
has
adopted
with
the
time
periods,
does
--
does
comply
with
due
process.
it
provides
a
way
of
dealing
with
some
number
of
the
issues
respondents
have
raised.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
under
this
court's
view
--
decision
in
fdic
v.
mallen,
i
don't
think
you
would
look
to
the
outer
limits,
your
honor.
but
i
think--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--again,
applying
--
well,
if
it
is
possible
for
the
states
to
do
it
in
a
shorter
fashion--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--and
if
a
state
--
if
a
state's
practice
were
to
do
so,
but
i
would
say--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--one
year
later.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
that's
shorter
than
the
time
period
that
this
court
found
complied
with
due
process
in
8,850--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--i
think
--
i
think--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--i
would
not
agree
--
i
would
not
agree
that
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
i
think
facially
it
is.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
i
think,
again,
i'd
go
back
to
fdic
v.--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
no,
i
would
say
10
years
without
any
judicial
intervention--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
40
days
i
think
is
consistent,
is
i
think
a
reasonable--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--if
--
if
--
i
would
say
this:
if
the
statute
said
you
can't
come
in
--
the
state
said
you
can't
proceed
for
10
years
and
no
one
has
any
--
property
owner
or
interest
owner
has
no
way
of
going
into
court,
that
probably
would
be--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--i
think
there
are
several
burdens.
one,
i
think
that
hearing
would
be
duplicative
of
the
ultimate
forfeiture
hearing.
i
think
if
it's
an
adversarial
hearing,
it
might
be
a
way
of
doing,
like,
a
--
like,
almost
back
door
discovery
in
the
--
in
the
attendant
criminal
case
if
we
had
to
do
an
adversarial
hearing
in
a
civil
forfeiture
case.
i
think
it
disregards
the
state's
interest,
your
honor,
in
--
in
promoting
informal
negotiation
and
settlement.
and
that's
something
i
had
hoped
to
talk
about.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
just
something
along
the
line--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--yes.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
first
of
all,
justice
breyer,
we
say
the
complete
deprivation
of
one's
liberty
is
not
the
same
as
the
deprivation
of
property.
the
way
we
do
it
under
our
statute
--
the
way
we
deal
with
this
issue
is
there's
--
the
statutory
regime
really
has
two
concepts,
one
for
property,
seized
property,
that
--
whose
value
exceeds
20,000,
and
one
where--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--it
does
merge
with
the
merits.
that's
historically--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--well,
there's
still
a--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--there's
no
formal
hearing.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
those
statutes
are
a
way
to
getting
into
--
to
getting
into
court--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--to
expedite
the
hearing.
and
once
the
hearing
is
filed,
your
honor,
it
is
certainly
possible
to
--
you
know,
to
move
to
expedite
the
trial.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
forty-five
of
those
days,
your
honor,
is
what
would
be
the
property
owner
deciding
whether
to
file
a
claim.
and
if
--
i
mean,
one
of
the
possibilities
--
it's
at
section
6
of
our
statute,
which
is
actually
nonjudicial
in
rem
forfeitures.
if
one
were
to
simply
file
--
a
property
owner
simply
file
a
claim
but
not
a
cash
bond,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
judicial
proceeding.
it
would
just
be
informal
negotiations
with
the
state's
attorney.
one
could
always
go
to
court
by
filing
a
cash
bond.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
the
bond
is
for
costs,
right.
but
the--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--there
isn't,
your
honor.
i
would
briefly
address
that.
i
know
i
have
1
minute
remaining.
i
would
like
to
--
to
reserve
the
time
for
rebuttal.
i
would
like
to
answer
this
question.
no,
your
honor.
for
bond,
about
80
to
85
percent
of
our
cases
are
cash,
seizures
of
cash,
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
recognized,
posting
a
cash
bond
for
cash
is
an
absurdity.
with
respect
to
cars,
your
honor,
the
problem
is
the
state's
duty
is
to
be
able
to
preserve
and
prevent
the
destruction
or
dissipation
of
the
property
prior
to
the
forfeiture
hearing.
if
we
bond
it
out,
we
can't
guarantee
that
at
the
ultimate
forfeiture
hearing,
that
property
would
be
--
would
be
preserved.
your
honor,
i
would
like
--
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
thank
you,
your
honor.
well,
your
honor,
initially,
two
of
the
claimants
here
lost
their
property.
they
defaulted.
three
had
their
property
returned.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
matter
--
the
underlying
matter
is
concluded
by
voluntary
cessation.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
one
did,
your
honor,
but
it
wasn't
in
response
to
the
federal
litigation.
so
our
position
would
be
if
this
is
moot,
this
is
really
--
munsingwear
would
apply.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
that's
correct.
well,
i
mean
--
it
didn't
settle
because
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
it
settled,
your
honor,
just
as
through
a
normal
course.
it
was
not
a
response
to
the
federal
litigation
that
was
going
on
independently.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
well,
i'm--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--oh,
no,
no.
in
most
cases,
yes,
your
honor.
the
private
--
the
hearing
--
the
cases
went
to
hearing
and
the
three
--
with
the
three
car
owners
and
they
ultimately
received
their
cars
back.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
two
of
them
--
two
defaulted
and
one
reached
a
settlement
with
the
state.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
no,
i
understand,
your
honor.
i'm
just
making
the
point
that
if
this
case
--
if
the
court
finds
it's
moot,
that
we
would
want
--
would
ask
for
an
entry
of
an
order
vacating
the
orders
below
pursuant
to
--
pursuant
to
munsingwear.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
settlement
wasn't
in
response.
we
didn't
settle
the
federal
--
we
didn't
settle
the
federal
litigation.
the
--
the
underlying
forfeiture
case
was
--
was
resolved.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
they
all
didn't
settle.
that's
right.
in
fact,
that's
a
better
answer,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
they
could.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
they
certainly
could,
if
you
--
they
have
the
right
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
we
--
and
we
would.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
there--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--right.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
there
is
not,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
forfeiture
is
not
going
to
help.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
not
that
we
--
illinois
doesn't
provide
for
a
bond,
your
honor.
as
we
indicated,
there
are
problems
with
bonds,
certainly
for
cash
and
for
--
and
for
other
personal
property
as
well,
but--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
let
me
attempt
to
address
that.
the
--
the
statute
does
contemplate,
your
honor,
section
--
especially
section
6
of
dafpa,
nonjudicial
remedies,
and
then
essentially
if
the
amount
of
property
is
under
20,000
or
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
car,
which
falls
under
section
6,
those
cases
are
routinely
dealt
with
by
negotiation,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that's
the
best
way
to
deal
with
hardship
--
the
hardship
examples
given
--
is
that
both
through
negotiation
and
a
speedy
hearing--
mr.
paul
a.
castiglione
--thank
you,
your
honor.
