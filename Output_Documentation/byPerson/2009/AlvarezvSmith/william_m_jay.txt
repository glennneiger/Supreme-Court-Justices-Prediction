mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin,
if
i
may,
with
the
colloquy
that
justice
stevens
and
justice
scalia
had
with
my
co-counsel
about
the
hypothetical
where
the
state
mandates
a
minimum
time--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
would
be
happy
to
begin
with
the
mootness
question,
your
honor.
and
i
--
although
i
think
that
it's,
to
some
degree,
a
question
for
the
respondents
what
precisely
they
are
seeking.
because
there
are
two
respondents,
yunker
and
williams,
who
have
lost
their
property.
the
property
is
in
the
possession
of
the
state.
and
if
their
position
is
that
unless
a
hearing
is
held
within
10
days,
which
is
what
they
originally
asked
for
in
their
complaint,
a
probable
cause
hearing
within
10
days,
if
after
that
no
forfeiture
is
possible
because
timely
post-deprivation
process
has
not
been
afforded,
if
that's
their
claim,
then
it
appears
their
claim
is
still
alive
because
the
state
still
has
their
property.
if,
however,
their
claim
expires
when
the
forfeiture
proceeding
is
actually
held,
then
that
proceeding
is
over
and
we
agree
that
their
injunctive
claims
are
moot.
mr.
william
m.
jay
it's
not
entirely
clear
from
their
complaint,
your
honor.
they
were
--
they
were
asking
for
the
imposition
of
this
10-day
hearing
requirement,
but
it
--
and
they
are
--
they
were
contending
--
now,
each
of
these
was
filed
after
the
10
days
had
run.
the
most
recent
seizure
had
occurred
2
months
before
the
class
action
complaint
was
filed
in
district
court.
so
it
appears
they
were
contending
that
they
wanted
the
forfeiture
proceeding
stopped
because
a
hearing
had
not
been
held
within
10
days.
so
the
complaint
doesn't
make
perfectly
clear
what
kind
of
injunction
they
were
seeking
except
that
they
wanted
the
imposition
of
this
10-day
procedure.
mr.
william
m.
jay
your
honor,
the
seventh
circuit
remanded
for
the
district
court
to
fashion
--
to
fashion
some
kind
of
procedure,
that's
right.
and
after
that
remand
order
the
plaintiffs,
interpreting
what
the
seventh
circuit
had
said,
filed
the
amended
motion
for
class
certification
that
mr.
castiglione
referred
to,
and
in
that
they
said
they
wanted
a
class
certified
to
pursue
damages
for
the
time
that
their
property
was
detained,
and
they
wanted
the
court
to
certify
a
class
of
anyone
who
had
had
their
property
held
for
more
than
7
days
this
time
without
--
without
a
proper
hearing.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
let
me
begin,
your
honor,
by
pointing
out
that
it's
not
the
law,
because
the
state's
ultimate
burden
at
the
hearing
is
not
preponderance
of
the
evidence;
it's
probable
cause.
it's
--
it's
precisely
the
same
burden
that--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--when
the
--
when
the
state
shows
probable
cause,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
claimant
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
--
so
the
ultimate
burden
is
by
a
preponderance.
mr.
william
m.
jay
but
it's--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--and,
justice
breyer,
you--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
florida
statute--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
florida
statute
--
you
are
correct
--
unique
as
far
as
i
know
among
all
the
statutes
legislated
by
the
50
states
that
use
asset
forfeiture
or
the
federal
government,
does
provide
an
adversarial
probable
cause
hearing
within
the--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
constitutional
justification,
justice
breyer,
requires
that
a
reviewing
court
look
at
each
step
in
the
process,
and
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
6
months
from
beginning
to
end.
that
process
in
illinois
and
in
many
other
systems
has
different
steps.
the
first
step
is
investigation
and
notice.
the
--
and
then
the
second
step
is
deciding
whether
to
pursue
this.
the
third
step
is
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
claimant,
where
the
claimant
decides
whether
to
pursue
a
judicial
hearing.
and
the
fourth--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--your
honor,
there's
more
to
investigate
than
just
the
probable
cause
to
seize.
in
many
cases,
the
probable
cause
to
believe
the
car
is
forfeitable
is
ironclad,
but
there
is
more
to
investigate
because,
for
example,
an
innocent
owner
in
illinois
by
statute
is
entitled
not
to
have
her
car
or
her
gun
or
her
personal
--
other
personal
property
--
it
could
be
currency
--
forfeited.
and
that--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--let
me
respond
to
that
in
a
couple
of
steps.
and
the
first
is
to
respond
to
your
point
about
the
incentives
that
local
police
departments
may
face.
there
is
no
incentive
to
--
to
hold
property
longer
than
necessary
because,
while
the
property
is
being
held,
there
is
no
ability
to
access
that
property.
if
it's
currency,
for
example
--
as
mr.
castiglione
pointed
out,
85
percent
of
their
seizures
are
--
the
currency
is
held
in
a
suspense
account
and
is
not
accessible
by
the
--
by
the
seizing
government
at
all.
so
the
government
has
no
interest
in
delaying
longer
than
necessary,
especially
for
cars.
the
government
has
to
take
care
of
the
car,
maintain
it
in
a
lot,
you
know,
preserve
it
from
--
from
harm.
second,
on
the
basic
question
of
what
is
the
government
doing
during
this
time?
the
government
has
a
due
process
obligation,
especially
in
an
in
rem
proceeding
like
this
one,
which
deals
with
a
piece
of
property
to
which
there
may
be
competing
claims.
the
government
has
a
--
itself
has
a
due
process
obligation
to
notify
everyone
who
has
a
claim
to
this
property
that
it's
in
the
government's
custody
and
that
there
will
be
a
proceeding
to
adjudicate
the
competing
claims
to
it.
i
mean,
this
court
in
robinson
v.
hanrahan,
a
decision
in
1972,
held
that
illinois
under
its
forfeiture
statute
had
violated
due
process
by
not
providing
notice
to
the
owner
--
to
the
registered
owner
of
a
car,
because
it
sent
notice
to
that
owner
at
his
address
when
in
fact
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
notify
--
to
investigate,
especially
after
a
seizure,
even
if
it
is
a
car
which
only
a
minority
of
seizures
are
--
even
if
it
is
a
car.
identifying
the
driver
is
not
enough
to
identify
who
has
a
claim
to
that
car.
there
may
be
a
registered
owner.
there
may
be
--
there
may
be
a
security
interest.
in
currency
cases,
it's
even
more
difficult,
because
on
the
face
of
currency
there
is
no
indication
who
owns
the
currency--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--and
that,
of
course,
as
i
think
the
hypothetical
recognizes,
justice
stevens,
is
different
from
a
statute
like
we
have
here
where
there's
a
maximum
time,
but
it
may
well
take
place
within--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--my
answer,
justice
stevens,
is
that
it
might
well
be
unconstitutional
as
applied.
and
the
court,
in
8,850,
says--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
justice
stevens,
because
sometimes
the
state
has
a
valid
interest
in
holding
property
for
more
than
a
year,
as
mr.
castiglione
said.
in
8,850
itself,
the
property
was
held
for
18
months.
the
court
has
said
in
any
due
process
case--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
the
state
responded
to
an
8,850
defense
and
said
--
and
said
nothing
other
than
the
statute
says
18
months
or
10
years,
and
--
you
know,
and
we
have
done
nothing
during
that
time,
i
think
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
applied.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
states
and
the
federal
government
are
not
sitting
around
doing
nothing
after
seizing
property.
they
are
actively
investigating
who
has
a
claim,
they
are
notifying
all
claimants,
they
are
allowing
--
allowing
those
claimants
to
file
claims
if
they
wish.
a
majority
of
all
seizures
are
uncontested.
and
then
whenever
a
claimant
wants
one,
that
claimant
is
entitled
to
an
in
rem
judicial
hearing,
where
all
--
all
claimants
come
into
court
and
have
--
have
the
government's
right
to
seize
the
property
adjudicated
and
also
the
affirmative
defenses,
such
as
the
innocent
owner
defense.
now--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
think
that
as
the
federal
framework
reflects,
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
that
is
--
that
can
be
addressed
by
legislation.
and
the
federal
hardship
provision,
18
u.s.c.
983(f),
is
a
good
way
of
illustrating
that;
that
the
government
has
competing
interests
in
all
these
cases
that
compete
with
the
claimants'
interests
and
in
cases
such
as
currency,
where
the
government
can't
be
secured
against
the
possibility
that
the
property
will
disappear,
then
--
then
there's
no
hardship
exception.
and
--
but
the
government
--
congress,
after
extensive
study,
has
made
a
hardship
provision
for
other
forms
of
personal
property.
mr.
william
m.
jay
you
are
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
that
there
is
no
statutory
provision,
no.
