justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
before
the
statute
was
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
basic
argument
that
you
make
that
a
forfeiture
hearing
is
all
the
process
that
is
due?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
question:
suppose
your
statute
said
there
shall
be
a
forfeiture
hearing
with
all
the
procedures
you
want,
but
the
forfeiture
hearing
shall
take
place
1
year
after
the
seizure.
would
that
be
adequate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i'm
saying
the
minimum.
the
hearing
will
take
place
1
year
after
the
seizure,
nothing
earlier
or
nothing
later.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
clearly,
it's
possible
to
do
it
in
less
than
a
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
no
practice,
no
background
practice.
this
is
a
new
statute.
so
this
--
you
have
to
have
a
forfeiture
hearing,
as
you
describe
it,
that
shall
take
place
6
months--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
a
year
later.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
what
the
court
has
held.
i'm
asking
your
view
of
that
hypothetical
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
agree
that
it's
unconstitutional,
then
you
have
to
agree
that
time
is
--
is
relevant
to
the
question
whether
the
forfeiture
hearing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
you
would
then
say
it
would
be
constitutional
to
say
one
hearing
1
year
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
get
you
to
answer
what
i
thought
you
were
going
to
do
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
how
do
you
answer
my
hypothetical?
you
have
a
forfeiture
hearing,
but
you
have
a
provision
that
it
shall
not
take
place
for
6
months.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it's
different.
i'm
just
curious
to
know
what
your
answer
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
it
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
justify
a
statute
that
says
in
all
cases
it
shall
be
held
for
at
least
18
months
without
telling
the
owner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
all
of
these
problems
really
arise
out
of
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
basically
was
to
overrule
the
motion
to
dismiss,
left
everything
open
on
remand.
so
if
we
said
it
is
moot,
you'll
just
get
another
plaintiff
and
bring
another
lawsuit,
which
is
what
you
do
if
the
court
--
we
are
trying
to
get
into
the
case
much
earlier
than
we
should,
it
seems
to
me.
just
let
the
proceedings
go
ahead
on
remand
and
find
out
what
all
the
--
all
these
factual
answers
that
--
or
these
questions
that
should
be
answered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
mootness
--
the
mootness
decision
won't
really
decide
anything.
you'll
just
say
you've
got
to
file
another
lawsuit
and
start
over
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
just
say,
we
--
probably,
in
my
judgment,
we
ought
to
dismiss
this
writ
as
improvidently
granted
and
let
the
record
be
developed
and
the
case
go
by,
and
we
could
decide
the
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
good
would
a
munsingwear
order
do,
anyway?
they'll
just
file
another
lawsuit,
won't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
if
the
district
judge
said
--
having
read
this
opinion,
which
was
vacated,
says,
well,
i
guess
it
states
a
cause
of
action,
i
will
deny
the
motion
to
dismiss
--
we
would
be
exactly
where
we
are
now.
