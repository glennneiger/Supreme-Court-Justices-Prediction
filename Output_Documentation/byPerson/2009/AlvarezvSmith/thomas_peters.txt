mr.
thomas
peters
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
moot.
it's
not
moot
because
at
the
time
that
the
plaintiffs
filed
the
case
they
clearly
had
standing.
they
immediately
moved
for
class
certification.
and
although
their
motion
for
class
certification
was
denied,
it
was
denied
because
the
merits
of
the
case
were
simultaneously
denied.
and,
in
fact,
this
court
has
addressed
a
situation
remarkably
similar
to
this
in
united
states
parole
commission
v.
geraghty.
in
the
geraghty
case,
the
class
was
not
certified.
it
was
denied,
as
it
was
here.
the
case
became
moot
because
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
a
federal
prisoner,
had
been
released
on
parole,
and
nonetheless
the
court
allowed
the
case
to
proceed.
and
the
reason
the
court
allowed
the
case
to
proceed,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
"capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review.
"
doctrine
was
invoked.
once
that
document
is
invoked,
the
claim
--
the
standing
relates
back
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
there
was
standing,
and
the
putative
class--
mr.
thomas
peters
--no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
what
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
thomas
peters
--i
respectfully
beg
to
differ,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
class
actions
and
cases
where
the
plaintiff
has
timely
requested
to
certify
a
class,
the
"capable
of
repetition"
relates
to
the
class.
there
is
right
now
today
a
class
of
people
in
the
city
of
chicago
who
have
their
cars
impounded.
that
--
their
claims
are
repeating
daily.
mr.
thomas
peters
well,
i
--
i
can
make
that
argument--
mr.
thomas
peters
--yes,
and
that
was
also
true
in
geraghty,
your
honor.
there
were
--
the
motion
for
class--
mr.
thomas
peters
--yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
peters
well,
we
couldn't,
your
honor,
because
it
was
inextricably
linked
to
the
merits.
in
geraghty--
mr.
thomas
peters
--i
don't
think
that
it
is
significantly
different
when
one
considers
the
concerns
that
animated
the
court's
decision
in
geraghty.
the
concerns
that
were
at
issue
in
that
case
were
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
was
representing
a
class
that
was
going
to
continue
to
exist
and
that
as
to
that
class
there
was
constantly
going
to
be
a
claim
repeating;
and
that
that
person,
even
though
the
class
was
denied
--
in
that
case
it
truly
--
it
was
denied
on
the
merits,
because
he
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
merits.
we
did
not
have
a
--
opportunity
to
litigate
the
merits
of
the
rule
23
issue.
mr.
thomas
peters
i
--
i
certainly
agree
that
it
is
not
an
identical
situation,
your
honor.
but
i
think
--
as
i
said
before,
i
think
again
that
the
concerns
that
caused
the
court
to
reach
that
position
in
geraghty
are
in
fact
the
same
because
in
this
case
the
--
there
is
a
continuing
activity
with
respect
to
the
class.
there
is
some
--
there
are
a
group
of
people
who
are
aggressively
pursuing
the
rights
of
that
class.
there
is
a
live
controversy
between
the
government
and
that
class.
so
in
all
of
those
respects,
which
are
similar
to
what--
mr.
thomas
peters
--that
was
--
that
was
all
that
was
before
the
seventh
circuit
because
i
don't
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
just
sort
of
a
gratuitous
gesture
to
say,
i
am
appealing
the
denial
of
the
class
certification
ruling,
when
the
class
certification
ruling
is
itself
based
entirely
on
the
denial
of
the
merits.
if
there
had
not
--
if
there
had
been
any
inkling,
any
ruling
that
suggested
that
the
rule
23
aspect,
the
class
aspect,
was
being
denied
on
class-related
grounds,
then
of
course
there
would
be
an
appeal.
but
what--
mr.
thomas
peters
--well
--
i
understand
your
honor's
position,
although
i--
mr.
thomas
peters
--i
think
that
--
that
waiting
would
be
the
prudent
thing
to
do.
and
it's
unquestionably
true
that
what
we're
suggesting
with
respect
to
the
preliminary
hearing
is
not
identical
to
the
final
hearing.
the
final
hearing
is
--
is
on
the
merits.
it
decides
where
the
property
is
going
to,
finally
and
ultimately.
the
hearing
we
are
talking
about
is
a
conditional
release
hearing,
similar
to
what
happens
in
krimstock,
similar
to
what
happens
under
the
civil
asset
forfeiture
review
act.
mr.
thomas
peters
well,
there
--
there
could
be
grounds
for
--
there
could
be
ways
of
getting
security
for
it.
i
mean,
perhaps
a
person
would
post
some
other
collateral
because
they
desperately
needed
the
cash
at
that
moment.
i
certainly
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
bond
procedure
is
much
more
in
tune
with
and
much
more
likely
to
work
with
cars
than
with
other
property.
mr.
thomas
peters
sure.
mr.
thomas
peters
no,
your
honor.
in
the
complaint
we
did
reference
10
days,
and
the
reason
we
did
that
is
because
we
thought
that
that
was
an
appropriate
time
frame.
mr.
thomas
peters
yes.
mr.
thomas
peters
no
and
no.
i
think
that
the
--
with
respect
to
whether
it's
an
adversarial
hearing,
i
--
what
we
envision
is
a
hearing
similar
to
what
happens
in
krimstock
where
basically
the
government's
burden
is
met
by
having
police
reports
which
on
their
face
establish
probable
cause
to
at
least
seize
the
car.
mr.
thomas
peters
well,
if
there
was
--
my
answer
to
that,
i
think,
your
honor,
is
in
two
parts:
one
is
the
federal
government
is
already
doing
something
like
that
with
the
cafra.
there
are
hardship
provisions,
and
part
of
the
hearing
could
include
showing
by
the
car
owner
or
the
property
owner
that
they
are
in
fact
likely
to
prevail
as
an
innocent
owner.
now--
mr.
thomas
peters
--the
cafra
doesn't
apply
to
cash.
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
peters
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
peters
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
burden
will
be
on
the
property
owner
to
establish
first
that
that
the
person
is
the
owner
of
the
property,
and
second
to
establish
to
some
yet-undefined
degree
that
they
have
a
likely
innocent
owner
defense.
mr.
thomas
peters
it
--
it
is
not
ordered
by
the
seventh
circuit
but
i
--
we
would
believe
that
an
innocent
owner--
mr.
thomas
peters
--argument
should
be
included,
and--
mr.
thomas
peters
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
peters
as
applied.
mr.
thomas
peters
yes,
we
made
that
clear
in
the
complaint.
there
has
never
been
any
argument--
mr.
thomas
peters
--to
the
contrary
until
this
court.
mr.
thomas
peters
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
what
we're
suggesting,
the
order
of
the
seventh
circuit
does
not
invalidate
any
provision
of
this
act
and
in
fact
it's
entirely
consistent
with
section
2
of
the
act,
which
incorporates
by
reference
federal
remedies
which
include
interim
remedies.
so
it
is
not
how
the
act
on
its
face
is
written.
it's
how
it
is
being
applied
to
these
people.
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
every--
mr.
thomas
peters
--there
is
a
federal
remedy,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not--
mr.
thomas
peters
--that's
--
that's
certainly
not
enough,
your
honor,
for
the
following
reason:
it
is
largely
impractical
for
most
people
--
many
of
the
people
who
are
involved
in
drug
forfeiture
seizures
are
people
with
modest
to
low
incomes,
probably
little
to
no
access
to
attorneys.
the
likelihood
of
them
understanding,
first
of
all,
that
they
may
have
this
right,
then
contacting
an
attorney
and
getting
an
attorney
to
litigate--
mr.
thomas
peters
--if
--
this
is
why
it
should
be
a
class,
and
it
clearly
applies
to
a
large
class
of
people.
mr.
thomas
peters
no,
your--
mr.
thomas
peters
--no,
that
is
not
so.
mr.
thomas
peters
yes,
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
thomas
peters
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
that's
a
function
of
the
fact
that
this
case
came
to
the
court
without
the
benefit
of
discovery,
without
having
an
opportunity
to
identify.
but
what
i
was
--
what
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
is
this:
we
are
not
suggesting
that
every
single
person
who
has
a
piece
of
property
taken
is
necessarily
entitled
to
this
hearing.
if,
for
example,
the
police
seize
my
favorite
baseball
card,
i
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
the
mathews
criteria
because
my
favorite
baseball
card
does
not
justify
putting
the
government
through
the
expense.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
categories
of
people
--
say
they
seized
$5,000.
there
is
some
limit
below
which
the
hearings
may
not
apply.
but
if
all--
mr.
thomas
peters
--there
would
have
to
be
--
first
of
all,
we
don't
know
how
that
would
administratively
be
handled
because
of
the
posture
of
the
case,
but
my
suggestion,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
this:
that
the
likely
result
in
a
case
--
in
this
case,
is
that
there
should
be
hearings
for
all
car
owners
and
that
there
should
be
a
baseline
dollar
value
below
which
a
person
is
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
now,
how
that--
mr.
thomas
peters
--yes.
mr.
thomas
peters
well,
in
--
in
those
circumstances
and
that's
the
only
car,
i
would
say,
most
likely,
the
property
should
be
returned
to
the
car
owner.
however,
i
would
add
that,
if
the
government
has
some
concerns
about
--
for
example,
that
they
need
additional
time
to
investigate
this
innocent
owner
claim,
then
by
having
the
hearing
in
front
of
a
neutral
and
detached
person--
mr.
thomas
peters
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
likely
to
happen,
and
i
think
what's
going
on
in
new
york
is
proof
that
that
is
not
how
it
works
out,
and
i
think--
mr.
thomas
peters
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
mr.
thomas
peters
well,
except--
mr.
thomas
peters
--yes,
your
honor,
but
let
me
go
back
in
response
to
your
question
and,
i
think,
in
part
to
justice
alito's.
the
seventh
circuit
hasn't
ordered
any
specific
hearing,
so
i
am,
at
this
point,
advising
the
court
of
what
i
think
this
hearing
should
look
like.
it
could
well
be,
upon
remand
and
discovery,
that
what
i
am
suggesting
the
--
the
hearing
should
look
like,
it
may
--
it
may
not
look
like
that
at
all.
it
could
be
that--
mr.
thomas
peters
--i
think
it's
invalid
as
applied
to
categories
of
people,
but
i
would
continue
to
maintain--
mr.
thomas
peters
--on
that--
mr.
thomas
peters
--the
seventh
circuit,
however,
did
not
endorse
completely
what
we
alleged
in
the
complaint.
we,
of
course,
in
the
complaint,
like
most
complaints,
ask
for
as
much
as
you
think
you
might
be
able
to
get.
but
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
order
hearings
across
the
board
for
every
single
person
whose
property
is
taken.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
every
single
person
whose
property
is
taken
will
necessarily
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
thomas
peters
there
are--
mr.
thomas
peters
--there
are
going
to
be
circumstances
when
the
value
of
the
property
is
de
minimis
as
compared
to
the
cost
of
the
hearing.
and--
mr.
thomas
peters
--yes,
i
--
i
did,
your
honor,
and
in
that
regard,
i
was
mistaken,
but
the
seventh
circuit
corrected
my
mistake
and
only
ordered
a
remand
for
a
determination
as
to
who
it
would
be,
who
would
be
entitled
to--
mr.
thomas
peters
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
does
change
it
because
now
the
ruling
is
what
was
determined
by
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
say
that
every
single
person
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
thomas
peters
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
peters
yes.
mr.
thomas
peters
i
don't--
mr.
thomas
peters
--well,
i
wouldn't
like
to
give
up
my
favorite
baseball
card,
but
the
reason
that
i
said
that,
your
honor,
is
this:
the
mathews
criteria,
which
we
are
espousing
here,
require
a
cost-benefit
analysis,
and
if
the
value
of
the
property
under
that
--
using
that
criteria
does
not
warrant
a
hearing,
then
as
to
that
property,
there
shouldn't
be
a
hearing.
so
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
hearing
in
every
case.
there
may--
mr.
thomas
peters
--i
--
i
continue
to
maintain,
your
honor,
that
the
--
as
long
as
there
was
standing
when
the
case
was
filed,
and
as
long
as
there
is
a
live
class
that
could
be
represented
by
these
class
--
or
putative
class--
mr.
thomas
peters
--potential
class.
yes,
your
honor.
then
there
is
standing
on
--
and
i
believe
that
the
standing
can
be
established
through
the
geraghty
decision.
i
agree
that
it
is
not
literally
identical
to
geraghty,
but
i
think
the
underlying
circumstances
that
animated
the
court's
decision
in
that
case
are
the
same
and
that,
therefore,
these
people
maintain
standing.
if,
however,
in
response
to
a
question
that
you
asked
mr.
castiglione
earlier,
if
the
case
became
moot
as
a
result
of
the
return
of
the
property,
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
munsingwear
situation.
it
would
be
a
bancorp
v.
bonner
situation,
because
if
it
became
moot
as
a
result
of
the
settlement
of
the
case
after
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
then
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
should
stay
in
place.
so
if
--
i
do
not
agree
that
the
case
is
moot,
but
if
hypothetically
the
case
were
moot,
then
we
are
not
in
a
munsingwear
situation;
we
are
in
a
bancorp
situation,
because
the
mootness--
mr.
thomas
peters
--no,
what
--
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
if
we're
--
if
we're
defining
mootness
as
the
ultimate
return
of
the
property,
then
the
property
was
returned
pursuant
to
settlements
in
four
of
the
cases.
the
plaintiffs
agreed,
we'll
pay
$400
instead
of
$20,000,
if
you
return
our
car.
the
car
was
returned.
so
if
the
case
was
settled
and
became
moot
because
of
the
settlement,
it
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
court
can
adopt
the
munsingwear
position.
it
really
is
a
bancorp
situation,
and
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
remains--
mr.
thomas
peters
--i
certainly
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
--
there
are
many--
mr.
thomas
peters
--yes.
mr.
thomas
peters
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
very
wise
choice
of
action.
mr.
thomas
peters
for
obvious
reasons.
but
beyond
that--
mr.
thomas
peters
--well,
they--
mr.
thomas
peters
--well,
the
narrowing,
as
i
perceive
it,
your
honor,
is
this:
i
believe
the
court
said
at
different
times
whether
an
appropriate
remedy
can
be
fashioned.
the
court
did
not
say
for
whom.
it
didn't
say
it
must
be
for
everybody.
it
didn't
say
what
would
be
necessary
to
trigger
the
right
to
the
hearing.
it
didn't
say
how
much
time
would
elapse.
it
left
--
it
did
leave,
in
that
sense,
everything
open,
but
by
leaving
everything
open,
it
also
allows
the
court
to
narrow
the
categories
of
people
who
would
be
entitled
to
this
hearing
that
--
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
be
an
effective
practical
remedy.
mr.
thomas
peters
thank
you.
