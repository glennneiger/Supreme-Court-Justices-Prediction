mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
ginsburg,
your
reading
of
the
schedules
is
completely
accurate.
there
was
nothing
more
that
ms.
reilly
could
have
done
to
indicate
her
intent
to
exempt
the
property
in
full.
the
bankruptcy
court
looked
at
this.
the
bankruptcy
judge
sees
thousands
of
these
kinds
of
schedules
and
made
that
determination.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
form--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
kennedy,
the
form
doesn't
call
for
that.
the
form
calls
for
a
list--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that's--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
but
consistent
with
the
form
and
the
information
the
form
requests,
she
completely
and
accurately
provided
the
information
the
form
requests.
and
she
--
as
the
bankruptcy
court
looked
at
this
and
said,
this
is
--
she's
claiming
the
property
in
full.
the
district
court
looked
at
this,
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
this,
all
to
the
same
conclusion.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
underscore
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
rules.
they
address
a
very
practical
problem.
we
need
to
know,
right
away,
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
is
this
property
the
debtor
gets
to
keep,
or
is
this
property
of
the
estate,
which
the
trustee
can
sell?
we
need
to
know
this
because,
under
section
363(b),
a
trustee
cannot
sell
property
if
it
is
not
property
of
the
estate.
and
if
the
property
is
claimed
as
exempt
and
nobody
files
an
objection,
it
is
exempt
under
522(l).
the
trustee
cannot
sell
it.
now--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--just
so
i'm
clear,
chief
justice
roberts,
if
she
claims
that
she
--
$15,000,
but
she
puts
a
value
of
$100,000?
is
that--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
if
she
undervalues
her
equipment,
for
a
hundred
years,
chief
justice
roberts,
that
has
been
grounds
for
objection.
for
a
hundred
years,
the
practice
has
been--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--not
quite,
chief
justice
roberts,
and
here's
why:
the
trustee
gets
the
form,
and
then
there
is
the
meeting
of
creditors,
and
the
trustee
gets
to
ask
questions
before
the
deadline
actually
occurs.
here,
the
trustee
went
and
asked
somebody
else,
do
you
think
this
is
worth
more
than
she's
claiming?
and,
apparently,
somebody
said,
perhaps
it
is.
then
the
trustee
could
ask
the
questions
of
the
debtor
directly,
and
if
the
debtor
--
if
the
trustee
needs
more
time,
the
trustee
can
do
one
of
two
things:
move
for
an
extension
of
time
to
object
or
simply
adjourn
the
meeting
of
creditors.
the
timing
is
completely
in
the
trustee's
control.
they
have
plenty
of
time.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
that's
what
the
statute
does.
it
poses
the
burden
on
the
trustee.
the
rule,
rule
4003,
imposes
the
burden
on
the
trustee
to
object
if
the
trustee
has
any
grounds
for
thinking
what
the
debtor
has
done
is
improper.
now,
these
schedules
are
signed
under
penalty
of
perjury.
there
are
criminal
sanctions
under
18
u.s.c.
sections
152
and
157
if
the
debtor
is
engaged
in
fraud.
there
are
penalties
under
section
727
or
707.
the
case
can
be
dismissed.
the
debtor
can
lose
her
discharge.
this
is
very
serious
affair,
stating
this
information.
the
debtor
here
very
thoughtfully
itemized
all
of
the
property,
she
filled
out
all
the
information
on
the
form,
and
she
did
something
else,
chief
justice
roberts.
on
page
28a
of
her
schedules,
she
checked
a
box
that's
required,
and
that
box
that
the
debtor
requires
--
is
supposed
to
check
basically
tells
the
trustee:
this
is
a
no-asset
case;
there's
not
any
value
left
over
for
anybody
else
after
you
account
for
my
exemptions.
it's
very
clear
from
the
box
she
checked
off,
from
the
information
that
she
provided,
she
was
claiming
the
property
in
full,
the
very
property
that
she
wanted,
her
tools
of
trade
to
engage
in
her
business.
again,
thousands
of
these
forms
are
done.
here,
the
bankruptcy
court
looked
at
this
and
said
she
was
exempting
the
property
in
full.
the
trustee
knows
this.
the
trustee
sees
thousands
of
forms.
he
had
the
information
that
he
claims
forms
the
basis
of
his
objection
well
before
his
deadline
passed,
yet
he
allowed
the
30-day
period
to
go
by
without
presenting
an
objection.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
in
the
last
column,
justice
alito?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
she
meant
that
the
value
she
claimed
in
full
of
her
property
was
what
she
was
claiming
as
exempt.
the
entire--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--she
held
the
property.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
she
very
carefully
listed
it,
and
a
debtor
in
bankruptcy--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that
was
her
valuation
of
the
equipment,
justice
alito.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia,
because
she
didn't
exhaust--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
justice
scalia,
she
did
not
exhaust
her
exemption
availability.
she
had
additional
exemption
availability
left
over
after
she
took
for
her
equipment.
she
detailed,
she
listed
the
assets,
she
listed
a
value.
and
under
our
law,
debtors
in
bankruptcy
who
own
property
are
considered
experts
with
respect
to
the
valuation
of
their
own
property.
shane
v.
shane,
891
f.
2d
at
872,
the
owner
of
property
is
competent
to
testify
as
to
its
value,
is
competent
to
testify
to
it.
here,
the
trustee
offered
nothing.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
rebut
her
valuation
that
she
swore
under
penalty
of
perjury
was
accurate.
she
did
--
again,
justice
scalia,
she
had
more
exemptions
she
could
have
used.
and
if--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
justice
alito,
because
$10,718
is
not
her
max.
that's
not
the
maximum
amount
of
value
that
she
could
have
claimed.
she
properly
did
what
all
debtors
have
to
do.
they
are
required
to
do
this
under
the
forms.
they
are
required
to
inventory
their
property
in
schedule
b;
they
are
required
in
schedule
c
to
state
a
value,
if
in
fact
they
know
it.
and
in
good
faith--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--she
used
it
for
perishable
food
items.
she
didn't
have
to
use
it
for
perishable
food
items.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
actually,
the
other
way
around,
justice
scalia.
she
valued
the
equipment
first.
then
she
determined
she
had
leftover,
leftover
exemption
ability,
and
she
applied
it
to
additional
items.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
actually,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
the
opposite.
after
taylor,
after
this
court's
decision
in
taylor,
trustees
understood
if
they
had
a
valuation
objection,
if
they
had
concern
that
the
debtor
might
be
getting
a
windfall,
they
needed
to
make
an
objection.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy,
but
that
was
the
appropriate
thing
to
say
for
that
particular
asset,
an
unliquidated
lawsuit.
when
we're
talking
about
tangible
property
such
as
cooking
equipment,
where
you
can
figure
out
--
you
look
at
the
pot
and
you
have
an
idea
of
what
it's
worth,
you
are
required
to
state
that
amount.
now,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
a
good
rule
of
decision
is
--
or
a
good
principle
of
decision
here
is
that
the
exemptions
are
part
of
the
fresh
start
in
bankruptcy,
and
we
construe
exceptions
to
that
fresh
start
against
creditors,
against
the
trustee.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
breyer,
there
has
not
been
an
avalanche
of
pro
forma
objections
being
filed
in
these
cases.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
yes,
your
honor.
he's
a
former
bankruptcy
judge.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
certainly--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
under
the
rules,
the
trustee
has
the
burden
of
objecting
if
the
trustee
has
any
basis
for
objection,
including
valuation,
and
--
but
the
trustee
has
to
have
a
good
faith
reason
for
objecting,
and
how
that
is
determined
is
the
trustee
looks
at
the
schedules,
asks
questions
at
the
meeting
of
creditors,
a
section
341
meeting,
and
then
if
the
trustee
has
any
objection
at
all,
present
it.
if
the
trustee
doesn't
present
it,
you
move
on.
we
have
--
finality
is
very
important
here.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
sotomayor,
and
the
trustee
has
had
that
burden
for
about
a
hundred
years.
and
under
the
former
bankruptcy
act,
they
had
much
shorter
deadlines
--
20
days,
15
days.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
they'd
have
to
do
that
in
their
motion
to
sell
anyway,
justice
sotomayor.
and
also
in
most
cases
it's
going
to
be
simple.
the
most
common
asset
that
this
is
about
is
a
car.
you
take
the
car
and
you
check
the
book
value
of
the
car,
and
the
trustee
can
do
a
simple,
easy,
expedient
comparison.
it's
a
little
more
complicated
when--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--in
a
situation
where
the
debtor
claims
the
property
as
exempt,
yes,
and
here's
why,
justice
kennedy:
because
the
trustee
again
can--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
if
the
debtor
claims
the
whole
property
is
exempt,
then
it's
not
property
of
the
estate
unless
the
trustee
interposes
a
timely
and
successful
objection,
because
section
362
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
authorizes
sales,
only
specifically
authorizes
sales
of
property
of
the
estate;
and
if
someone
claims
property
as
exempt,
if
no
objection
is
interposed
under
522(l),
then
the
property
claimed
as
--
is
exempt.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
if,
in
fact,
the
debtor
claims
the
property
as
exempt,
that's
correct.
unless
the
debtor
concedes,
the
trustee
can
sell
it.
that
has
to
happen
anyway,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
kennedy,
and
here's
why:
because
the
statute,
for
example,
points
that
the
court
is
going
to
determine
in
the
first
instance
whether
the
objection
claim
is
valid,
if
there
is
in
fact
an
objection.
how
do
we
know
this?
because
section
522(a)
says
value
is
determined
as
of
the
date
the
debtor
files
for
bankruptcy.
we
do
not
have
sales
to
determine
whether,
in
fact,
the
property
is
what
it's
worth.
we
determine
whether
the
--
that
the
claim
of
exemption
is
valid.
first,
there's
a
judicial
determination
of
value.
it's
geared
towards
the
date
of
the
petition
date.
why?
because
congress
understood
that
debtors
want
this
property,
not
just
a
check
from
the
trustee.
it's
part
and
parcel
of
their
fresh
start.
as
this
court
explained
in
rousey
and
in
owen,
that
the
fresh
start
policy
embraces
the
exemption.
that
is
very
plain.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
am
certain
about
it.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
would
say
that,
justice
breyer.
i
am
certain
about
that.
i
have
just
--
answered
one
question,
then
taken
off
to
another
one.
i
didn't
get
to--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
the
practical
reality
is
that
there
are
over
a
million
bankruptcy
cases
that
are
filed
a
year.
most
of
those
are
chapter
13
or
chapter
7
cases,
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them.
and
that's
why
the
box
that's
checked
on
page
28a
is
a
key
piece
of
information
for
the
trustee.
when
the
debtor
says,
this
is
basically
a
no-asset
case;
after
you
take
account
of
my
exemptions,
there's
no
property
left
over
for
unsecured
creditors
--
the
trustee
looks
at
that.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
trustee
makes
a
judgment
--
a
judgment
call:
hmm.
i
look
at
all
the
things,
does
it
look
right?
if
i
feel
like
i
need
to
ask
questions,
i
will
ask
them
at
the
meeting
of
creditors.
which
is
what
happened
here.
if
the
trustee
then
is
still
suspicious
in
some
way,
then
the
trustee
can
seek
an
appraisal,
and
if
the
trustee
wants
to
get
that
appraisal,
then
the
trustee
can
ask
for
additional
time
to
do
it.
if
the
court
thinks
that
there's
perhaps
merit
to
it,
the
trustee
will
give
--
the
court
will
give
the
trustee
additional
time.
more--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
exactly
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
trustee
here,
before
the
meeting
of
creditors,
went
and
talked
to
an
auctioneer.
in
the
ordinary
situation,
it
will
happen
a
little
bit
differently,
where
the
trustee
will
look
at
the
schedules,
and
perhaps
before
the
meeting
of
creditors,
the
trustee
might
inquire
with
someone
else,
but
oftentimes
the
trustee
might
ask
questions
at
the
meeting
of
creditors.
and
then
if
the
trustee
wants
to,
if
the
trustee
thinks
it's
worth
it
to
get
an
appraisal,
then
the
trustee
will
ask
for
the
--
for
the
additional
time
to
do
--
do
the
appraisal,
by
either
asking
the
court
for
an
extension
or
by
adjourning
the
meeting
of
the
creditors.
but
it's
very
important
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
--
there's
a
very
important
finality
question
here,
a
finality
principle.
the
debtor
needs
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
--
and
this
is
why
we
have
an
objection
deadline.
the
debtor
needs
to
know
as
soon
as
possible:
is
this
my
property?
can
i
take
this
cooking
equipment
and
can
i
use
it?
am
i
the
one
who
is
to
insure
it?
can
i
conduct
my
business?
can
other
creditors
lend
me
money
now,
now
that
i'm
going
through
bankruptcy
and
i
have
my
discharge?
or
is
this
something
that
the
trustee
is
going
to
take
and
sell?
that
is
why
we
have
this
objection
deadline,
to
basically
say
to
the
trustee,
if
you
have
any
objections
whatsoever
about
the
debtor
keeping
this
property
--
whether
their
value,
or
the
statutory
basis
under
522(d)
is
incorrect
--
whatever
reason
it
may
be,
make
your
objection
and
we'll
have
a
quick
determination
by
the
court.
it
cannot
be
true,
as
the
trustee
would
like
it,
that
the
trustee
can
sell
at
any
particular
point
in
time
in
the
future
without
having
to
make
an
objection,
because
that--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--not
precisely,
justice
ginsburg,
because
many
of
these
issues
are
resolved
by
unpublished
orders.
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
evaluate
and
get
a
hold
of.
but
i
think
by
and
large
the
vast
majority
of
bankruptcy
courts
follow
taylor
in
this
--
in
this
area
and
will
say,
well,
when
you
list
the
value
of
the
asset,
if
the
trustee
has
an
objection
as
to
value,
then
the
trustee
must
make
the
objection.
if
the
trustee
doesn't
make
the
objection--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
so
the
courts
have
to
apply
the
holding
in
taylor
to
a
slightly
different
factual
context.
but
most
bankruptcy
courts
say
this
is
really
the
same
situation.
because
after
all,
in
taylor,
what
the
trustee
was
saying
was
that
i
think
the
debtor
is
getting
too
much
--
was
getting
too
much
at
the
end
of
the
day.
and
the
same
thing
here,
the
trustee
is
saying:
i
think
the
debtor
is
getting
too
much;
it
may
be
worth
more.
but
if
the
debtor
thinks
there's
a
problem
with
the
valuation
--
again,
make
an
objection,
because
we
need
to
have
that
finality.
finality
was
a
key
concept
in--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
thank
you
for
correcting
me.
if
the
trustee
thinks
there
is
a
problem,
the
trustee
has
to
make
an
objection.
we
get
that
finality
taken
care
of,
and
then
we
can
move
on.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
can
see
that,
justice
sotomayor,
but
i
think
that
here
are
much
worse
incentives
with
the
trustee's
rule,
and
much
worse
problems,
much
greater
harm
to
the
statutory
scheme.
now,
your
honor's
question
about
these
court
of
appeals'
decisions
--
i
think
a
lot
of
them
are
driven
by
the
following,
which
has
since
been
cured
by
an
amendment
to
the
rule.
a
lot
of
them
involve
situations
where
the
court
of
appeals
was
thinking
--
and
looking
at
the
record
and
thinking
the
debtor
was
engaging
in
some
kind
of
misrepresentation
or
manipulation.
and,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
his
concurrence
in
taylor,
you
know,
there
is
this
--
what
about
this
problem?
are
there
105
powers?
are
there
--
is
there
authority
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
basically
act,
if
you
have
a
basically
bad-acting
debtor?
now
the
current
version
of
rule
4003
makes
an
exception
for
fraud.
if
there
were
bad
things
that
happened,
that's
been
taken
care
of
now
under
the
rule.
but
we
shouldn't
assume
that
and
certainly
not
in
this
case.
ms.
reilly
was
perfectly
honest
and
straightforward.
she
set
forth
everything
that
the
forms
required.
the
really--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it's
not
an
irrational
conclusion,
except
it
is
one
that
is
contrary
to
the
statutory
scheme.
it
basically
says
to
the
trustee,
you
need
not
object
by
the
30
days,
if
you
want
to
sell
the
property.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
but,
justice
sotomayor,
it
is
the
filing
of
the
objection
that
triggers
the
negotiation,
and
this
is
key.
this
is
--
this
is
really
quite
key
because
the
practice
is
that,
if
the
trustee
exempts
to
the
--
exempts
--
sorry
--
objects
to
the
valuation,
then
there
is
a
court
hearing,
and
the
court
will
resolve
the
objection
if
the
parties
can't
negotiate
it
afterwards.
and
if
you
look--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
if
there
is
no
objection,
then
is
no
involvement
of
the
court,
and
the
conversation
stops.
and
the
reason
why
you
have
the
objection
is
because
the
trustee
has
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
demonstrating
that
the
debtor's
valuation
is
wrong.
and
that's
important
because
when
the
trustee
is
now
saying,
oh,
i
just
need
to
sell,
i
don't
have
to
object,
the
trustee
is
evading
his
burden
of
proof.
by
just
simply
saying,
i'm
authorized
to
sell,
i
am
going
to
sell,
as
long
as
it
is
not
the
debtor
who
doesn't
object.
the
trustee's
proposal
inverts
the
burden
of
proof.
it's
now
under
the
trustee's
proposal,
when
the
trustee
files
a
motion
to
sell,
the
debtor
has
to
come
forward
and
object
and
now
say,
wait,
i
have
a
valuable
exemption
here.
what
--
what
the
trustee
then
has
done
is
simply
said,
i
don't
have
to
comply
with
my
burden
of
proof
that's
set
by
the
rule
and
the
statute.
after
all,
section
522(l)
puts
the
burden
on
the
trustee,
as
well,
to
object.
so
they
are
inverting
the
burden
of
proof,
and
congress
and
rules
have
put
the
burden
of
proof
completely
in
the
opposite
way.
and,
again,
we
need
that
--
we
need
that
finality.
the
trustee
would
basically
have,
under
his
proposal,
an
ability
to
file
a
motion
to
sell
a
year
later,
2
years
later,
4
years
later,
by
reopening
a
case
that's
been
closed,
if
the
trustee
thought
that.
our
whole
point
about
finality,
which
was
a
key
principle
animating
the
decision
below
and
also
this
court's
decision
in
taylor,
where
the
court
made
the
observation
that,
although
these
deadlines
may
yield,
in
some
situations,
unwelcome
results,
they
serve
very
important
finality
interests.
the
debtor
needs
to
know,
is
this
my
property?
can
i
use
it?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
instead
she
said,
this
--
the
trustee
wants
to
sell
all
of
the
property.
he's
filing
--
he
filed
a
motion
to
sell
all
of
it.
the
trustee
did
not
give
her
an
opportunity
to
do
that
allocation,
which
she
would
have
had
if
the
trustee
had
filed
an
objection.
in
responding
to
the
objection,
she
could
have
said,
well,
i'm
only
going
to
allocate
something,
because
the
objection
would
have
been
under
the
exemption
rules;
whereas,
the
trustee,
when
the
trustee
filed
the
motion
to
sell,
it
was
under
363,
which
is
the
motion
to
sell
rules,
where
the
debtor
would
then
have
had
to
come
forward
and
object
to
the
motion
for
some
reason,
but,
again,
you
don't
have
that
allocation
option
under
section
363.
and,
again,
the
trustee
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse.
the
trustee
cannot
sell
property,
unless
it
is
property
of
the
estate,
and
under
section
522,
if,
in
fact,
the
debtor
claims
property
as
exempt,
if
there
is
no
exemption
--
no
objection,
it
is
exempt,
and,
therefore,
it's
not
property
of
the
estate.
"exempt"
means
exempt
from
property
of
the
estate.
a
trustee
cannot
sell.
congress
set
up
this
regime
purposefully,
to
have
judicial
determinations
of
exemptions
right
away,
and
that,
again,
is
triggered
by
an
objection
being
filed.
that
way,
we
know,
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
does
the
debtor
have
the
property?
can
she
use
it?
can
she
continue?
third
parties
--
can
they
rely
on
that?
or
is
this
something
the
trustee
is
going
to
be
able
to
sell?
now,
it's
important
also
because
the
practice,
in
bankruptcy,
as
reflected
in
the
collier
forms,
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
can
make
a
judicial
determination.
say,
for
example,
the
bankruptcy
court
here
had
said:
i
think
there
is
some
merit
to
the
trustee's
objection;
the
property
is
worth
$12,000.
the
practice,
as
reflected
in
the
sample
form,
is
for
the
court
then
to
say
to
the
debtor:
debtor,
if
you
want
to
keep
this
property,
give
the
trustee
a
check
for
the
difference
between
what
you're
entitled
to
claim
and
what
i'm
establishing
the
value
to
be.
that
can
happen
if
an
objection
to
the
exemption
is
filed,
and
we're
under
section
522
exemptions.
that
can't
happen
if
we're
under
section
362
sales.
so,
again,
the
trustee's
rule
eliminates
that
established
practice
and
that
established
option
in
favor
of
the
debtor.
also,
the
debtor
could
say
--
could
reallocate
--
the
debtor
has
the
right,
under
the
rules,
under
rule
1009,
to
reallocate
her
--
her
exemptions
after
the
trustee
has
--
she
could
have
sacrificed
some
other
area
or
something
and
taken
--
taken
her
additional
exemption
availability
somewhere
and
applied
it.
all
those
options
are
foreclosed,
where
the
trustee
doesn't
file
an
objection
and
the
trustee
moves
to
sell
instead.
now
--
i
see
my
time
has
not
expired.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
thank
you.
