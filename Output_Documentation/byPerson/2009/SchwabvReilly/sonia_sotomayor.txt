justice

has
that
happened
in
the
two
circuits
that
apply
a
rule
similar
to
this,
the
sixth
and
the
third?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
under
your
rule,
the
trustee
has
30
days
to
get
this
good
faith
basis.
does
that
mean
that
he
or
she
has
to
get
a
valuation
on
everything
that's
listed
at
full
value,
that
that
is
really
the
burden
we're
talking
about?
it's
not
the
burden
of
filing
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
i
want
an
a
exemption,
or
even
one
that
says
i
have
an
objection.
it's
what
it
takes
to
support
that
objection
and
how
much
effort
goes
to
that
activity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
there's
a
huge
difference
between
a
rule
that
says
you
don't
have
to
actually
go
after
this
information
in
a
formal
way.
if
someone's
claiming
only
the
exempt
amount,
then
i'll
go
ahead
and
i'll
administer
the
estate,
and
over
time
i'll
talk
informally
to
people
and
get
a
sense
of
whether
the
valuation
is
right
or
not,
but
i
won't
actually
--
actually
have
to
get
a
formal
appraisal
because
i'll
just
use
my
judgment.
your
rule
would
require
something
else.
they
would
have
to
get
the
appraisal
to
lodge
the
request
for
an
extension
or
to
lodge
the
request
for
an
objection.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
in
--
what's
interesting
is
that
all
of
the
circuits
or
most,
the
majority,
have
not
announced
the
fixed
rule.
the
rule
they've
said
is:
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
and
so
it
appears
to
me
that
most
of
the
courts
are
saying
to
us:
we
don't
want
a
default
rule,
because
we
have
to
see
what
has
happened
and
see
what
has
happened
between
the
parties
to
determine
in
one
situation
rather
than
another
what
the
intent
was.
it's
not
an
irrational
rule.
why
shouldn't
we
be
considering
that
as
an
alternative?
because
once
we
make
an
announcement
like
the
one
that
you're
proposing,
it
is
an
inducement
to
undervalue
your
property,
for
a
debtor,
because
--
in
the
hopes
that
an
overly
worked
trustee
won't
have
either
the
time
or
opportunity
or
wherewithal
to
understand
that
the
value
is
off
and
that
they're
going
to
lose
something
that
the
estate
is
entitled
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
there
are
comparable
circuit
court
opinions
and
situations
very
analogous
to
this
one,
where
the
circuit
courts
have
looked
at
what
the
trustee
and
the
debtor
have
done
during
the
process.
and
if
the
debtor
has
not
made
it
clear
that
they're
seeking
the
full
value
of
the
property,
as
happened
here,
there
was
a
conversation
that
the
value
was
off,
the
debtor
did
not
tell
the
trustee
that
she
was
claiming
the
full
amount
of
the
property.
and
there
are
analogous
situations
where
the
circuits
have
said,
no,
that
doesn't
show
your
intent
because
you
didn't
articulate
it
to
the
trustee
in
the
informal
meetings.
that's
not
an
irrational
conclusion
by
those
circuits.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
what
it
says
is,
if
you're
engaged
in
good
faith
negotiation
over
a
value
or
over
the
claimed
exemption,
you
should
--
both
sides
should
be
open
about
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
most
of
these
cases,
the
objections
are
--
the
discussions
are
not
at
the
time
of
objection.
they
are
at
the
time
of
the
creditors'
meeting.
it
is
part
of
the
discussion.
that's
what
the
courts
are
looking
to.
what's
happening
between
the
parties?
have
they
made
their
intent
clear,
and
what
does
that
intent
reflect?
