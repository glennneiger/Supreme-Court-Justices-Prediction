chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-538,
schwab
v.
reilly.
mr.
goldblatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
a
remarkable
coincidence
if
her
equipment
happened
to
be
worth
exactly
what
congress
said
she
could
exempt,
which
is
a
very
odd
way
of
reading
what
she's
put
in
the
schedule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
the
most
natural
way
of
reading
it
is
that
she's
claiming
the
equipment
because
she
thinks
that's
the
value
of
the
equipment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
thank
you,
mr.
goldblatt.
i'll
afford
you
rebuttal
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
does
she
put
down
if
she
thinks
this
is
what
the
property
is
worth,
but
she
doesn't
know
for
sure?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
accurately
value
a
bunch
of
kitchen
equipment.
what
is
she
supposed
to
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
goes
through
--
i
think
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
you
have
to
go
through
a
long
process
if
you're
going
to
have
an
auction,
and
for
this
sole
proprietorship,
it
seems
like
a
waste
of
money
and
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
i
mean,
this
is
a
government
form,
and
you
say,
even
though
it
says
"value
of
the
claimed
exemption"
and
"current
market
value",
that
these
debtors
should
know,
oh,
you
should
put
in,
as
your
friend
said,
put
in
an
asterisk
and
write
something
else
in
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
wall.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
it
turns
out
that
this
business
equipment
was
worth
$100,000
and
the
trustee
looks
at
it
and
says,
oh,
she's
only
claiming
--
you
know,
less
than
she's
entitled,
$10,000,
and
doesn't
object,
she
gets
that
dramatic
windfall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no.
she
--
she
--
and
it
may
be
even
in
good
faith
or
--
or
bad
faith,
depending
on
the
rule
we
--
we
adopt,
but
she
gets
that
incredible
bonus
because
it
turns
out
her
business
equipment
is
worth
a
lot
more
than
she
put
down.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
--
the
trustee
doesn't
know.
he
doesn't
know.
he
looks
at
it
and
says,
oh,
that
sounds
like
kitchen
equipment
might
be
worth
that,
and
so
he
doesn't
object.
what
you're
doing
is,
i
think
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
you're
requiring
the
trustee
to
object
to
everything,
lest
he
lose
the
$100,000
that
it
turns
out
this
is
worth.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
the
point
is,
that
drags
out
the
whole
process.
you're
imposing
a
burden
on
the
trustee.
he
loses
everything
if
he
doesn't
object,
and
i
think
the
idea
is
that
these
things
move
as
quickly
as
you
can,
and
you
don't
want
the
trustees
--
you
know,
i
may
be
severely
prejudiced;
the
creditors
might
if
i
don't
object,
so
i'm
going
to
object
to
everything;
we'll
sort
it
out
later.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
mr.
goldblatt,
2
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
08-538,
schwab
versus
reilly,
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
