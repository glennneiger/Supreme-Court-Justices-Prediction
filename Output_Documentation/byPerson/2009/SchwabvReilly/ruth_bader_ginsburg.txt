mr.
goldblatt,
i
thought
that
what
she
said
--
i'm
looking
at
schedule
c,
property
claimed
as
exempt.
she
lists,
as
property
claimed
as
exempt,
"see
attached
list
of
business
equipment.
"
and
then
we
have
an
inventory
going
for
several
handwritten
pages
of
all
these
items
of
kitchen
equipment.
and
that's
what
she
says
is
the
property
claimed
as
exempt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
--
in
her
inventory,
she
gives
figures,
and
they
add
up
to
the
amount
that
she's
claiming,
so
she
evidently
thinks
that
those
numbers
will
cover
all
of
her
business
equipment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
--
mr.
goldblatt,
this
is
--
this
is
really
my
concern.
it
seems
what
she
wants
is
her
cooking
equipment,
not
the
money
equivalent.
and
if
the
trustee
had
objected,
she
could
have
said:
well,
if
they
think
that
this
cooking
equipment
is
worth
more
than
the
value
that
i
put
down,
i'll
cut
out
the
coffee
maker,
i'll
cut
out
the
microwave;
but
what
i
want
is
the
equipment,
not
the
dollar
--
dollars
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
going
through
all
the
administrative
expenses
of
having
an
auction
where
if
the
trustee
had
tipped
her
off,
it
would
be
like
amending
your
pleading.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
she
was
so
--
so
upset,
she
said:
i'll
get
out
of
the
bankruptcy;
i
want
my
cooking
equipment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
very
clear
that
that's
what
the
debtor
wanted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
whether
--
the
question
is
whether
the
trustee
had
to
make
an
objection,
when
it
seemed
really
as
clear
as
could
be
that
what
she
was
seeking
was
to
keep
her
equipment,
not
to
get
the
--
some
monetary
equivalent
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
she
has
--
on
your
reading,
her
claim
is
improper
because
she's
claiming
more
than
she's
entitled
to.
if
her
claim
is
improper,
then
the
trustee
has
an
obligation
to
object
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
--
can
you
--
that
was
--
what
you've
just
said,
no
requirement
that
the
trustee
object
to
valuation,
one
of
the
briefs
--
it
may
have
been
wrong,
but
it's
the
nacba
brief
at
page
27
--
said
"challenges
to
valuation
are
the
most
common
types
of
objections
to
exemptions.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
concern
is
keeping
it
simple,
giving
fair
notice
to
people.
she's
got
the
same
amount
under
exempt
--
the
last
two
columns.
a
rule
is
proposed.
it
says
when
the
two
columns
have
the
same
amount,
that's
a
clue
to
the
trustee
that
the
debtor
is
claiming
all
of
the
--
that
particular
property.
that's
a
nice,
simple
rule.
it
tells
the
trustee
when
he
has
to
object,
and
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
in
kind
in
the
sense
that
she
keeps
the
asset
no
matter
what.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
is
contending
that
she
would
like
to
keep
her
cooking
equipment
and
she
was
entitled
to
notice
before
it's
going
to
be
sold
at
an
auction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
--
then
her
claim
is
wrong,
her
claim
is
objectionable,
and
the
trustee
should
have
made
an
objection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it's
not
the
asset
itself
and
it's
just
about
money,
here
i
have
a
piece
of
property
and
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
it
was
a
case
of
widgets
or
my
grandmother's
diamond
ring.
but
congress
--
this
is
a
peculiar
list
it
has.
it
has
personal
jewelry,
tools
of
trade.
it
sounds
like
--
even
though
those
have
a
dollar
cap,
it
sounds
like
congress
said
these
are
the
kinds
of
things
a
debtor
would
want
to
keep
in
kind.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
she
did
do,
she
said:
that
unsettles
me
so
much
that
i'm
going
to
withdraw
from
this
bankruptcy
proceeding;
beyond
anything,
i
want
to
keep
that
--
that
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
but
the
bankruptcy
court
did
that
simultaneously
with
saying:
and
i'm
going
to
deny
the
trustee's
motion
to
have
an
auction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
she
could
have
done
is
trimmed
some
items
from
the
list.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
much
less
informative
than
if
she
said
--
i
mean,
here
she
--
she
has
one
list
that's
showing
what
she
paid
for
it.
she
makes
her
best
guess.
it's
--
you're
suggesting
that
she
would
be
entitled
to
the
notice
if
she
put
down
100
percent>
["].
so
your
--
on
your
theory,
in
order
to
do
what
she
obviously
wants
to
do,
preserve
her
kitchen
equipment,
she
has
to
give
no
information
or
inaccurate
information.
if
she
said
--
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
if
she
said
a
100
percent,
instead
of
saying
what
she
thought
was
the
--
the
value,
or
if
she
said
unknown,
she
would
be
entitled
to
notice
from
--
to
an
objection
from
the
trustee.
but
because
she
has
tried
her
best
to
put
down
what
the
form
calls
for,
she
doesn't
get
any
objection
from
the
trustee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
she--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
can
you
elaborate
on
this
additional
--
she
--
you
said
she
could
have
listed
something
that
came
to
a
higher
number.
are
you
talking
about
the
part
of
the
leftover
of
the
wildcard
exemption
that
she
--
she
used
it
for
food,
didn't
she?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
what
--
what's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--here
i
thought
that
the
trustee
got
the
appraisal
before
the
creditors'
meeting,
because
at
the
creditors'
meeting
he
said
to
her,
you
put
down,
what,
10,000;
i
have
an
estimate
that
says
$17,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
brunstad,
do
we
know
what
is
the
division
among
bankruptcy
judges
on
this
issue?
i
mean,
you
are
urging
that
when
those
columns
3
and
4
match,
that's
a
tip-off
that
the
debtor
is
claiming
the
entire
property
is
exempt.
do
we
know
what
is
the
lay
of
the
land
among
bankruptcy
judges?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
debtor
did
know
at
the
creditors'
meeting
--
she
certainly
knew
that
the
trustee
was
claiming
the
property
was
worth
more
than
what
she
listed
it
as
being
worth.
she
could
have,
at
that
point
--
so
she
had
the
notice
of
what
he
was
thinking.
she
could
have,
at
that
point,
said,
i
will
remove
as
many
items
as
necessary
to
bring
me
safely
within
the
limit.
she
didn't
do
that.
