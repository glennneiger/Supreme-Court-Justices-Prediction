mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
is
not
saying
that
it's
a
coincidence
that
these
numbers
in
the
third
and
fourth
columns
are
the
same.
it
is
a
common
practice.
a
debtor
will
often
estimate
what
she
believes
to
be
the
market
value
of
her
property
and
then
divvy
up
a
wild
card
across
items
in
hope
--
hopes
of
keeping
them.
the
government's
and
petitioner's
only
point
is
that
where
a
debtor
does
that,
as
respondent
did
here,
she's
still
claiming
the
fixed
exemption
of
what
she
believes
to
be
the
market
value.
now,
i
take
your
concern,
justice
ginsburg,
this
might
be
unfair
to
debtors
who
wouldn't
be
tipped
off.
that
is
not
true
here,
where
the
trustee
came
to
the
creditors'
meeting
and
said:
i
construe
your
exemption
as
limited,
and
i
think
the
property
is
worth
about
$7,000
more,
and
i
intend
to
sell
it.
and
at
that
point,
a
debtor
who
really
believed
that
her
schedule
claimed
full
value
would,
it
seems
to
me,
have
said:
you're
misreading
my
schedule.
she
didn't
do
that.
she
didn't
do
that
until
after
the
30-day
period
had
run
when
the
trustee
moved
to
sell
the
property.
now,
she--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
right.
but
she
--
but
she
--
she
did
walk
in.
she
didn't
say:
you're
misreading
my
schedule.
she
said:
i
don't
want
you
to
sell
the
property
if
indeed
it's
worth
more
than
the
exemption
i've
claimed,
and
so
i
want
to
dismiss
my
bankruptcy.
which
she
doesn't
have
a
right
to
do
under
chapter
7.
she
has
to
show
cause
under
section
707(a).
the
bankruptcy
court
found
that
she
had
not
shown
cause,
and
the
debtor
didn't
appeal
that
determination,
which
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right.
and
on
remand,
it
would
certainly
be
open
to
her
to
attempt
to
convince
the
bankruptcy
court
again
that
she
had
shown
cause
under
707
to
dismiss.
i
think
the
government's
point
is
that
there
is
a
process
for
sale.
so
even
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case,
when
the
trustee
wants
to
sell
property,
he
has
to
give
20
days'
notice
to
the
debtors
and
the
creditors
under
section
363
of
the
code
and
rule
2002.
so
if
the
trustee
here
had
not
even
said
anything
at
the
creditors'
meeting
but
had
moved
to
sell,
he
would
have
had
to
give
notice
to
the
debtor,
who
at
that
point
could
always
amend
her
schedules
under
rule
1009.
if
she
had
any
exemption
left
to
claim,
she
could
walk
in
and
say:
i'm
going
to
amend
my
schedule,
and
i'm
going
to
increase
my
exemption,
because
i
underestimated
the
property
value.
the
reason
she
didn't
and
couldn't
do
that
here
is
because
she
had
maxed
out
her
wild
card.
but
it's
--
indeed,
even
on
remand--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--and
she
still
could
on
remand.
even
on
remand,
she
could
walk
in
and
amend
her
schedule
and
say:
i'm
going
to
itemize
exactly
the
equipment
that
i
want
to
keep
with
my
wild
card.
and
i'm
going
to
say
which
of
my
kitchen
equipment
i
want
to
keep
with
my
$10,225,
and
which
i
don't.
so,
it's
not
that
--
there's
nothing
about
petitioner's
approach
that
denies
the
debtor
the
fresh
start
to
which
she
is
entitled
under
the
code.
she
--
she
can
always
claim
right
up
to
the
legal
limits.
what--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
there
are
a
number
of
questions
there,
justice
breyer.
but
with
all
respect,
that
is
not
what
the
statute
and
the
rules
say.
what
the
statute
and
the
rules
say
is
if
you
have
an
objection
to
the
property
claimed
as
exempt
on
the
list
--
and
as
a
historical
matter
over
time,
schedule
c
has
required
debtors
to
put
additional
information
besides
their
exemptions.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
it
says
the
list
of
property
claimed
as
exempt.
so,
for
instance,
for
nearly
the
first
100
years
after
they
set
up
the
system
in
1898,
on
schedule
c
and
its
predecessors
the
debtor
put
down
the
location
and
present
use
of
property.
but
no
one
thought
that
the
location
was
part
of
the
claim
of
exemption,
such
that
if
the
trustee
believed
the
property
was
in
one
place
than
another,
he
had
to
object.
the
idea
was
we'll
provide
some
useful
information
to
the
trustee
beyond
the
claim
of
exemption,
so
that
if
he
wants
to
file
a
turnover
complaint
to
get
the
property
into
the
estate,
he
knows
where
it's
located.
but
it
just
isn't
true,
as
a
historical
or
logical
matter,
that
everything
that
shows
up
on
schedule
c
is
part
of
the
claimed
exemption.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
that's
entirely
fair.
they
do
have
to
have
a
creditors'
meeting,
so
they
do
have
to
--
you
know,
within
20
to
40
days
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
but
i
think
what
will
happen
on
respondent's
approach
as
a
practical
matter
is
the
world
will
look
no
different;
it
will
just
have
a
lot
more
litigation.
whenever
the
numbers
in
columns
3
and
4
match
up,
the
trustee
will
file
a
pro
forma
objection
or
extension
request.
cases
will
proceed
exactly
as
they
do
now.
property
can
be
sold.
some
will
be
returned
to
the
debtor
and
some
will
not.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
exactly.
and
i
think
the
reason
that
it's
odd
to
set
up
that
kind
of
presumption
is
because
you're
basically
presuming
that
the
debtor
is
acting
to
claim
an
exemption
in
kind
to
which
he
is
not
entitled
under
the
code.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
the
debtor
would
do
exactly
what
she
did
here,
and
if
the
trustee
went
to
sell
and
she
had
remaining
exemption
left,
she
could
come
in
and
amend
her
schedules
and
say--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
if
the
debtor
actually
wanted
to
claim,
say,
full
value
or
100
percent
of
value
--
there
are
debtors
that
commonly
do
that.
since
at
least
taylor
20
years
ago,
debtors
on
the
form
have
been
writing
down,
in
the
third
column--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
don't
even
think
it
has
to
be
an
asterisk.
it's
--
debtors
commonly
will
put
in
on
these
forms
where
they
want
to
claim
full
value,
even
if
they're
not
entitled
to
it
under
the
code,
full
value,
100
percent
of
value.
the
debtor
in
taylor
wrote
down
"unknown".
some
contingent
term
that
places
the
trustee
on
notice
that
says:
hey,
whatever
the
value
of
the
property
is--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
debtor
does
have
a
duty
to
report
the
market
value
in
the
fourth
column,
what
she
believes
it
to
be,
but
the
third
column
supports
her
claim
and--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
no.
she'd
write
it
in
the
third
column
because
what
she'd
be
saying
is
--
the
third
column
is
just
subjective.
it's
just
what
you
want
to
claim,
and,
under
100
percent
of
value.
and
then,
in
the
fourth
column,
she
would
make
an
estimate
as
to
what
she
believed
that
value
to
be.
and,
in
the
event
that
she
underestimated,
she
could
always
come
in
and
amend
her
exemptions.
i
think
it
would
be
odd
to
read
a
form
where
she
cited
statutory
provisions
that
allow
her
to
claim
interest
up
to
a
dollar
cap
and
then
she
had
put
down
definite
and
fixed
numbers
to
say
to
the
trustee,
you
should
assume,
despite
the
statutory
text
she
is
citing
and
the
numbers
she
is
giving
you,
that
she
is
claiming
an
unauthorized,
in-kind
exemption,
despite
the
very
statutory
provisions
on
which
she's
relying
as
the
bases
for
her
exemption.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
wherever
the
debtor
lists
a
contingent
term
in
the
third
column,
whether
it's
unknown
or
100
percent
of
value,
the
trustee
absolutely
has
to
object.
it
--
but
--
but
where
the
trustee
doesn't
object
is
where
the
debtor
does
what
she
did
here
and
lists
a
fixed
sum.
