justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
petitioner
william
schwab
is
a
trustee
of
respondent
reilly’s
chapter
7
bankruptcy
estate.
reilly
filed
for
bankruptcy
when
her
catering
business
failed.
when
a
debtor
files
for
bankruptcy,
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that,
all
of
the
debtor’s
assets
become
property
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
subject
to
the
debtor’s
right
to
reclaim
certain
property
as
exempt.
the
bankruptcy
code
specifies
the
types
of
property
debtors
may
exempt
and
also
limits
the
value
of
the
exemptions
a
debtor
may
claim
in
certain
assets.
property
a
debtor
claims
as
exempt,
will
be
excluded
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
unless
a
party
in
interest
such
as
a
trustee
like
schwab
objects
to
the
exemption
within
a
certain
time
period.
in
this
case,
we
resolve
the
disagreement
among
the
courts
of
appeals
about
what
kind
of
information
triggers
the
duty
to
file
such
an
objection.
reilly’s
professional
cooking
equipment
was
one
of
the
assets
that
became
property
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
this
equipment
had
sentimental
and
professional
value
to
reilly
and
quite
understandably,
she
wished
to
exempt
it.
the
bankruptcy
code
and
rules
require
debtors
who
wish
to
exempt
certain
property,
from
their
estates
to
fill
out
a
form,
that
form
is
known
as
a
schedule
c
and
on
that
form
they
must
provide
certain
information
about
their
exemption
and
the
property
to
which
the
exemption
applies.
the
dispute
in
this
case
arose
because
it
is
possible
to
read
the
information
on
reilly's
schedule
c
form
in
one
of
two
ways.
either
as
a
claim
to
exempt
the
entire
value
of
her
cooking
equipment
which
would
be
objectionable
because
the
equipment's
total
value
exceeds
the
dollar
amount
that
the
code
allows
for
exemptions
in
such
assets
or
it
could
be
read
as
a
claim
to
exempt
only
an
interest
in
the
equipment
worth
a
certain
dollar
amount
within
the
code’s
limits,
which
would
then
be
proper
and
therefore
unobjectionable.
the
bankruptcy
code
provisions
that
reilly
cited
on
her
schedule
c,
entitled
her
to
exempt
an
interest
in
her
cooking
equipment,
not
to
exceed
a
certain
dollar
amount
because
reilly
schedule
c
expressly
listed
the
value
of
the
claimed
exemption
as
a
specific
dollar
amount
below
the
code’s
limits.
schwab
did
not
object
to
the
exemption
before
he
asked
the
bankruptcy
court
for
permission
to
sell
the
cooking
equipment,
so
that
he
could
pay
reilly
the
amount
of
her
exemption
and
distribute
the
equipment's
remaining
value
to
reilly’s
creditors.
reilly
object
into
the
proposed
sale
on
the
grounds
that
schwab
should
have
read
her
schedule
as
a
claim
to
exempt
the
equipment
in
its
entirety
even
though
its
appraised
value
exceeded
the
code’s
exempted
limits.
the
district
court
agreed
with
reilly
and
held
that
schwab’s
failure
to
make
a
timely
objection
entitled
her
to
keep
the
equipment.
court
of
appeals
affirmed
citing
this
court’s
1991
decision
in
taylor
versus
freeland,
that
the
deadline
for
bankruptcy
objections
must
be
strictly
enforced.
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
a
better
schedule
c
entries
must
be
read
in
light
of
the
code,
the
bankruptcy
code
provisions
that
govern
the
exemptions
set
forth
in
the
schedule
and
code’s
requirement
must
control
over
a
debtor’s
intent
or
a
standalone
reading
of
the
schedule.
in
this
case,
the
code
provisions
that
govern
reilly’s
exemptions
define
the
property
that
she
claimed
exempt
as
an
interest
in
her
cooking
equipment,
not
as
a
equipment
itself,
and
place
a
specific
dollar
limit
on
the
value
of
that
interest
because
the
dollar
value
reilly
assigned
the
interest
on
schedule
c
was
below
the
code’s
specified
limits.
schwab
was
entitled
to
treat
her
claim
as
a
valid
exemption
in
the
amount
she
listed
and
thus
did
not
have
to
object
to
the
claim,
in
order
to
preserve
for
the
estate,
the
value
in
the
equipment
beyond
that
amount
because
reilly’s
claimed
the
exemption
in
the
equipment
was
not
objectionable,
neither
bankruptcy
rule
4003’s
deadline
for
making
objections,
nor
our
taylor
decision,
if
in
enforcing
that
deadline
applies
here.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
breyer
have
joined.
