justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
that
case
--
in
that
case,
i
guess
there
wouldn't
be
a
--
a
lawsuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
in
that
case,
the
debtor
is
never
going
to
object.
so
we're
never
going
to
have
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
you
sit
down
with
the
creditors,
and
you
look
at
the
list
and
you
try
to
work
things
out.
that
meeting
goes
on
as
long
as
you
want.
and
if
it
appears
there's
an
argument
about
valuation,
you
file
an
objection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
appears
everybody
can
work
everything
out,
fine.
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
rule
is
--
and
that's
what
it's
about
--
the
rule
is
about
where
you
object,
the
trustee
objects
to
the
list.
the
list.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
called
schedule
c.
if
you
have
an
objection
to
the
list,
then
it
says:
here's
what
you
do,
trustee.
meet
with
the
creditors,
try
to
work
it
out.
and
if
in
fact
30
days
thereafter
and
you
don't
need
any
more
time,
so
you
don't
ask
the
judge
for
more
time,
file
an
objection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
sounds
very
complicated.
i
--
i
mean,
the
thing
that
sort
of
persuaded
me
so
far
on
this
is
this
is
what
collier
says,
the
other
side
--
it's
what
all
the
bankruptcy
judges.
ambro
is
a
bankruptcy
judge.
this
is
a
simpler
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look
at
the
procedural
rule.
it's
just
what
i've
said.
it
says:
if
you
have
an
objection
to
the
list
of
property
--
the
list
of
property
is
c,
okay?
so
here's
what
you
do,
trustee:
sit
down
with
the
creditors.
see
if
there's
really
an
argument.
now,
if
there's
no
argument,
fine;
they'll
let
you
do
what
you
want.
if
there
is
an
argument
and
it
has
to
do
with
that
list,
c,
particularly
valuation,
which
is
what
these
things
are
all
about,
then
file
your
objection.
that's
so
simple.
and
it
seems
in
most
places
they
do
it.
so
why
do
we
want
to
run
around
robin's
barn
or
something
to
get
somewhere
we
can
get
to
much
simpler?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
rule
403
doesn't
say
that.
my
rule
403
says:
"a
party
in
interest
may
file
an
objection
to
the
list
of
property
claimed
as
--
as
exempt
within
30
days
after
the
meeting.
"
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
"the
list".
so
that's
where
i
think
you're
becoming
awfully
legalistic,
to
try
to
distinguish
between
the
list
and
the
property
in
a
and
b.
i
mean,
what
do
you
--
these
are
about
valuation,
says
collier.
that's
all
we're
interested
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
sense
of
how
it
works
in
practice?
i'm
a
little
worried
by
justice
kennedy's
question,
because
the
government
says
in
practice
what's
been
happening
is
that
in
most
places,
trustees
don't
--
they
don't
object
to
these
kinds
of
valuations
problems,
and
now
suddenly
when
the
rule
has
changed
in
some
circuit,
they
do
object
as
a
matter
of
form,
which
is
unnecessary
paperwork.
the
impression
i
had
from
reading
collier,
and
it
was
--
the
opposite
was
so,
that
normally
when
you
have
the
creditors'
meeting,
things
would
appear,
what
was
a
problem
or
what
wasn't,
and
the
creditor
would
then
file
an
--
or
the
trustee
would
then
file
an
objection.
well,
what
is
the
case?
how
does
the
practice
work?
i'm
--
i'm
pretty
uncertain.
i'm
not
a
bankruptcy
expert.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
how
did
it
work
normally
for
years
and
years?
you'd
go
into
a
committee
meeting
of
creditors.
they'd
get
into
an
argument
about
the
valuation.
i'm
sure
that
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
that
happened,
did
trustees
file
objections
within
30
days
or
didn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
i
was
impressed
by
ambro.
isn't
he
the
judge
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
had
been
a
bankruptcy
judge,
so
maybe
he
knows.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
don't
know
who
knows,
because
i'm
worried
the
government
has
looked
into
this,
and
somebody's
telling
them
who
knows
it's
the
opposite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
very
confused
because
of
your
answer
to
justice
sotomayor.
i
thought
what
you
were
saying
--
she
said,
well,
you
only
have
30
days;
you
get
all
this
value.
that
doesn't
say
very
much.
you
said,
well
--
you
--
you
said
less.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
less
time.
which
isn't
much
of
an
answer,
but
it's
something.
now,
i
would
have
thought
you
were
going
to
say
but
it's
30
days
from
the
creditors'
meeting
ending,
and
that's
a
movable
feast
that
could
last
5
years.
you
could
keep
postponing
it.
you
can
go
to
the
judge
and
say,
judge,
give
me
an
extension,
which
he'll
do.
so
there's
no
problem
here.
but
you
didn't
say
that.
so
the
fact
that
you
didn't
say
that
suggests
to
me
you're
not
certain
about
what
this
practical
impact
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
certain?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
how
long
do
these
creditors'
meetings
last?
how
easy
are
they
to
postpone?
how
--
how
easy
is
it
for
the
trustee
to
get
this
information
together
during
the
creditors'
meeting,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
where
do
i
look
to
find
out
the
answer
to
that
question?
