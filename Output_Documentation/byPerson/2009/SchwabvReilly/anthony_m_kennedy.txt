justice
anthony
m.

well,
they
don't
always
liquidate
the
asset,
if
they
--
if
they
elect
--
if
everybody
agrees
that
they
get
the
asset
itself,
they
don't
have
to
sell
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
--
what
you
are
doing
there,
you
--
you
argue
that
ambiguities
are
construed
against
the
person
that
made
the
form.
i
think
that's
a
little
harsh
when
the
trustee
is
a
repeat
player
and
knows
--
and
knows
the
rules.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
what
you
have
going
for
you
is
that
the
trustee
is
going
to
always
be
at
risk
that
the
asset
is
worth
more
than
what's
listed
and
is
going
to
have
to
take
steps
to
value
it
in
every
--
every
case.
in
this
case,
it's
--
it's
clear
that
she
--
she
knew
that
the
honda
was
worth
more.
she
was
only
claiming
$2,900,
$2,950
on
a
honda.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
if
you
take
that
together
with
--
and
--
and
the
kitchen
equipment
comes
next,
and
she
--
and
the
value
is
the
same
in
each
column.
so
that
indicates
that
she
was
claiming
the
full
value.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
also
true
--
tell
me
about
this:
one
of
my
concerns
is
that
the
trustees
simply
don't
have
time
in
every
case
to
have
a
creditors'
meeting
and
go
through
every
asset.
if
they
did,
then
justice
breyer's
suggestion,
where
they'd
sit
down
and
talk
about
all
this
stuff,
would
be
--
would
be
fine.
am
i
right
or
wrong
in
making
that
empirical
assumption?
i
mean,
i
just
don't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
has
to.
otherwise,
he
is
at
risk
that
it
might
be
worth
$400,000
or
whatever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
she
could
have
said
"in
full".
you
can't
say
she
couldn't
have
done
nothing
more.
she'd
put
"in
full".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
100
percent
of
value>
["].
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
you've
said
that
there's
nothing
else
she
could
do,
and
i
said,
of
course,
there's
something
else
she
could
do.
in
taylor,
the
case
you
cite,
they
put
"unknown".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
understand
your
position,
but
you
can't
say
there's
nothing
else
she
could
have
done.
that's
--
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
do
you
know
that
from
the
form?
number
one,
i
think
both
sides
have
--
have
an
argument
as
to
what
the
form
means.
i
don't
think
it's
at
all
clear-cut.
as
i
say,
i'm
looking
for
some
kind
of
a
rule
to
tilt
the
case
one
way
or
the
other.
all
right?
i
don't
put
a
lot
of
credence
in
the
fact
that
she
--
the
ambiguities
are
construed
against
her.
i
am
concerned
that
in
every
case,
under
your
rule,
the
trustee
is
at
risk
unless
he
makes
an
objection,
and
i
think
that's
just
going
to
make
bankruptcy
proceedings
much
more
protracted
and
much
more
complex.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
therein
--
the
problem
was
triggered
when
they
put
in
the
word
"unknown".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
in
every
single
case
where
an
asset
is
sold,
there
has
to
be
a
valuation
beforehand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
--
if
he
claims
the
whole
property
is
exempt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
was
--
i
thought
i
understood
your
remark
to
say
anytime
there's
a
sale,
there
has
to
be
a
valuation
or
an
appraisal
before
the
sale.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
--
but
the
very
fact
that
it's
--
that
there's
going
to
be
a
sale
may
indicate
that
your
premise
is
not
true
most
of
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
once
again,
taylor
had
the
word
"unknown",
and
this
doesn't.
and
that's
the
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
if
the
trustee
thinks
there's
a
problem?
