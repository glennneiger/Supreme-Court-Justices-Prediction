justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
i
look
at
that
number,
i
--
and
maybe
i
don't
understand
this,
so
maybe
you
or
your
adversary
can
clarify
it
for
me.
but
when
i
look
at
that
number,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
ways
to
interpret
it.
one
is
that
she
is
saying:
i
want
the
full
amount
that
i'm
allowed
by
law.
and
the
other
is:
that
i
want
the
value
of
my
equipment,
and
it
just
so
happens
to
total
exactly
to
the
dollar
the
amount
that
i'm
entitled
to
by
law.
am
i
correct
that
those
are
the
two
possible
readings
of
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
question
is
which
of
those
is
the
more
plausible
reading?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
when
she
put
down
the
figure
$10,718
on
page
58a
of
the
joint
appendix,
what
did
she
mean
by
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
she
meant
that
that
was--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--she
had
--
she
had
figured
out
the
value
of
the
property,
and
her
estimation
of
its
fair
market
value
was
$10,718?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
wasn't
$10,717?
it
wasn't
$10,719?
it
was
$10,718?
that's
what
she
meant?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
a
--
that's
a
totally
different
question.
it's
just
--
it
is
--
your
submission
is
that
it
is
a
pure
coincidence
that
her
good
faith
estimation
of
the
current
market
value
of
this
property
just
happens
to
add
up,
to
the
dollar,
to
the
amounts
that
she
was
entitled
to
exempt
under
the
specific
statutory
provisions
that
she
cited
in
the
previous
column?
