justice
antonin
scalia
where
would
she
say
that,
100
percent
interest
in
the
equipment?
would
she
say
that
in
--
in
column
3?
justice
antonin
scalia
column
3
says
"value
of
claimed
exemption".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
say
that.
but,
boy,
i
wouldn't
read
--
i
wouldn't
read
the
--
i
wouldn't
read
the
--
the
chart
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
a
column
that
says
"value
of
claimed
exemption".
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
the
--
that
the
last
column
does
--
it's
very
clearly
entitled
"current
market
value
of
property"
without
deducting
exemptions.
there's
no
way
to
read
that
last
figure
of
10,718
except
as
her
assessment
of
the
market
value
of
her
cooking
equipment.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
is
that
where
she
would
write
100
percent
--
in
the
third
column,
rather
than
the
fourth?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
wait.
why
would
the
trustee
object?
i
mean,
he
would
still
be
objecting
to
the
valuation.
you
say
that
he
has
no
--
no
obligation
to
object
to
the
valuation.
but
if
she
writes
100
percent
of
value
in
the
third
column,
that's
what
she's
claimed,
and
then
values
it
at
something
above
the
exemption,
right?
above
the
permissible
objection,
he's
still
objecting
to
the
valuation,
isn't
he?
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
a
realistic
valuation.
nobody
thinks
that
that's
an
honest
valuation
of
the
equipment.
it's
simply
adding
up
the
--
the
exemption
she
was
entitled
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
--
her
valuation
just
happened
to
be
exactly
the
amount
that
the
two
exemptions
she
had
would
add
up
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
she
was
maxed
out.
once
she
used
it
for
that,
she
was
maxed
out,
but
she
wanted
to
have
her
cake
and
eat
it
too.
she
wanted
to
get
the
exemption
for
the
food
and
she
wanted
to
get
the
exemption
for
the
--
for
the
equipment.
and
so
it
just
so
happened
that
the
equipment
valuation
added
up
to
precisely
what
was
left
over
after
she
took
the
exemption
for
the
--
for
the
food.
