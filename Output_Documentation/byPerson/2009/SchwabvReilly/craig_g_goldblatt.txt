mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
debtor
in
this
case
claimed,
in
the
third
column
of
schedule
c,
a
$10,718
exempt
interest
in
her
kitchen
equipment.
that
claim
of
exemption
was
fully
proper.
the
trustee
did
not
object
to
it
because
it
was
unobjectionable.
the
debtor's
position
here
is
that
because
of
what
she
wrote
in
the
fourth
column,
where
she
estimated
the
value
of
the
equipment
as
the
same
amount
of
the
exemption,
that
her
claim
of
exemption
itself
should
be
read
to
say
something
different
from
and
greater
than
what
it
actually
says.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
incorrect.
if
you
turn
to
her
schedule
c,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
57
and
58a,
the
first
column
is
a
description
of
the
property,
and
the
third
column
contains
the
value
of
the
claimed
exemption.
the
property
claimed
as
exempt
here
is
the
$10,718
interest
in
the
asset
listed
in
column
a.
and
the
reason
that's
clear,
your
honor,
it's
clear
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
because
the
statutory
language
of
522(l)
provides
that
the
debtor
files
a
list
of
property
that
the
debtor
claims
as
exempt
and
that,
unless
a
party
in
interest
objects,
the
property
claimed
as
exempt
is
exempt.
522(l)
refers
to
the
property
claimed
as
exempt
under
subsection
(b),
and
subsection
(b)
in
turn
references
subsection
(d),
which
is
the
basis
for
the
claim
of
exemption
here.
and
522(d),
when
it
describes
the
exemption,
says
the
following:
"the
following
property
may
be
exempted:
one,
the
debtor's
aggregate
interest,
not
to
exceed
$18,450
in
property.
"
--it
goes
--
and
it
enumerates
a
series
of
exemptions.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
justice
ginsburg,
it
may
--
that
may
well
be
true.
she
may
--
the
debtor
here
may
well
have
believed
that
the
value
of
the
equipment
here
was
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
exemption.
but
no
one
contends
in
any
serious
way
that
the
trustee
is
required
to
object
to
the
debtor's
valuation
of
the
equipment.
after
all--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--your
honor,
the
debtor
here
may
well
have
wanted
the
equipment.
the
question
here
is,
did
she
make
a
claim
on
her
schedule
that
the
equipment
was
itself
exempt
in
kind?
there
are
a
number
of
ways
that
debtors
can
do
that.
they
can
write,
"i
claim
an
exemption
in
the
full
amount.
"
here,
take
--
take
a
debtor
who
is
saying:
look,
all
i
want
is
the
exemption
that
congress
gives
me.
i
understand
that
all
i'm
entitled
to
here
is
a
$10,718
interest
in
my
equipment.
i
think
my
equipment
is
worth
that.
if
it
turns
out
that
i'm
wrong
and
it's
worth
more,
i
don't
want
any
more
than
the
bankruptcy
code
gives
me.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
we
--
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
the
most
natural
way
to
read
what
she
has
said
in
the
schedule
is
that
she's
claiming
exactly
what
she
says,
which
is
that
she
is
claiming
a
$10,718
interest
in
the
property.
to
get
to--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--if
she
wanted
to
claim
the
equipment
itself
as
exempt,
there
were
a
number
of
ways
that
one
could
do
that.
she
could
say:
i
claim
100
percent
interest
in
the
equipment;
i
claim
an
in-kind
interest.
here
it
would
be
odd
to
read
that,
because
there
is
no
suggestion
that
has
been
made
by
anyone
that
she
has
any
entitlement
to
an
in-kind
exemption
in
the
equipment.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
in
either
column
--
yes,
in
column
3.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
debtors
can
certainly
list
in
the
schedule.
they
can
list
an
asterisk
and
say:
i
claim
an
interest
in
the
property
itself.
here
the
--
because--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--there's
a--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--correct,
and
the
value
of
the
claimed
exemption
here
was
$10,718--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--which
is
exactly
what
the
trustee
proposes
to
give
her.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
that
claim
of
exemption
was
proper.
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
fair
question,
which
is
what
--
what
is
a
debtor
to
do
here
if
she
wants
equipment
itself,
the
debtor
is
surely
entitled,
justice
ginsburg,
to
--
if
the
trustee
seeks
to
sell
the
equipment
at
auction,
to
participate
in
that
auction
and
to
credit-bid
her
exemption.
and
no
--
no
one
disputes
that.
so
if
the
--
if
the
debtor
wants
to
come
to
the
auction
and
say,
look,
i'm
bidding
my
exemption,
and
that
will
buy
me
as
much
of
my
equipment
as
it
will
buy
me,
the
debtor
is
fully
entitled
to
do
that.
and
in
that--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--well,
in
fairness,
in
this
case
itself,
the
trustee
happened
to
come
to
the
section
341
meeting
and
say:
i
believe
that
there's
value
here
for
the
estate.
i
think
there's
value
in
excess
of--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--that's
right,
but--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--and
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
trustee
took
the
position
that
she
was
entitled
to
the
exemption
that
congress
permits
and
no
more
than
that.
and
the
debtor
didn't
say--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
imagine
you
had
a
debtor
who
--
who
came
into
court
and
said:
look,
i
believe
my
equipment
is
worth
something
equal
to
the
amount
that
is
permissible,
that
i
may
permissibly
claim
as
exempt,
but
i
don't
mean
to
make
an
improper
in-kind
exemption.
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
more
value
than
congress
intends
me
to
keep.
if
it
turns
out
to
be
worth
more,
that
belongs
to
my
creditors.
all
i
want
is
what
i'm
entitled
to
by
statute.
that
debtor
would
have
no
alternative
way
to
express
that
but
to
do
exactly
what
this
debtor
did
here.
and
we
think
the
most
plausible
way
to
read
it
is
--
is
to
read
it
to
have
this
debtor
be
expressing
an
intention
that
is
consistent
with
law
and
not
one
that
is
improper.
there
is
--
there
is
no
basis
under
which
this
debtor
is
entitled
to
keep
more
than
a
$10,718
interest,
and
under
the
ordinary
presumption
that
you
presume
parties--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--justice
ginsburg,
it's
only
improper
if
it's
read
to
mean
something
different
from
what
it
says.
what
she
said
here
in
the
schedule
is:
i
claim
an
exempt
interest
of
$10,718
in
the
equipment,
and
i
believe
the
equipment
is
worth
that
amount.
the
question
is,
should
that
be
read
to
be
making
an
improper
claim
that
the
equipment
itself
is
exempt
in
kind,
a
claim
that
would
be
--
would
be
clearly
improper,
or--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--that's
--
that's
certainly
--
we
think
that
that's
right.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
right,
and
we
--
we
think
that
--
that
for
a
number
of
reasons,
the
more
plausible
reading
is
to
say:
all
i
want
is
what
the
law
permits
me.
the
--
the
principal
reason
is
that
as
a
general
proposition
you
wouldn't
presume
someone
to
be
making
a
claim
for
which
there
would
be
no
legal
basis.
and
in
any--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia,
but
the
critical
point
is
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
any
trustee
come
in
and
object
to
a
valuation
if
the
valuation
is
improper.
imagine
she
had--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--let
me
--
let
me
explain
this
for
a
moment,
if
i
may.
imagine
the
debtor
here
had
listed
the
value
at
$15,000
and
her
exempt
interest
as
10,718.
in
that
case,
the
debtor
--
the
trustee
would
surely
be
entitled
to
sell
the
asset.
the
debtor
themselves
acknowledges
that
on
page
30
of
the
respondent's
brief.
in
that
case,
what
the
value
that
the
equipment
would
obtain
would
be
whatever
a
willing
buyer
and
willing
seller
would
pay.
it
could
be
$15,000,
it
could
be
$30,000,
it
could
be
$130,000.
and
the
fact
that
the
actual
value
of
what
--
what
a
buyer
would
pay
for
it
was
different
from
the
debtor's
valuation
would
be
of
no
moment.
whatever
value
the
trustee
was
able
to
obtain
for
the
asset--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--no.
that's
exactly
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
that's
exactly
right.
but
--
but
the
point
here
is
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
--
when
a
debtor
files
an
individual
bankruptcy
case,
on
schedule
b
the
debtor
lists
the
valuation,
their
estimated
valuation
of
all
of
their
assets.
there
is
absolutely
no
requirement
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
bankruptcy
rules,
or
anywhere
else
that
a
trustee
go
through
and
say
whether
they
agree
or
disagree
with
the
debtor's
positive
valuation.
instead,
what
a
trustee
does
is
they
liquidate
the
asset,
they
generate
the
value
that
is
there,
and
they
distribute
that
value
to
creditors.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
that's
exactly
right.
the
trustee
may
determine
to
abandon
an
asset
to
the
debtor
if
there's
no--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--well--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--that's
right,
and
that
was
subject
to
a
security
interest
here.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
with
--
with
respect
to
the
--
the
automobile,
there's
--
there's
a
claim
of
exemption
and
the
rest
is
subject
to
a
security
interest.
here
--
i
mean,
the
critical
point
is
if
a
debtor
wants
to
--
to
put
to
--
to
the
issue
and
say,
listen,
i
really
want
to
keep
the
equipment
itself,
i
don't
think
there's
any
value
here
for
the
estate,
there
is
a
statutory
mechanism
to
address
that.
section
554(b)
says
quite
clearly
that
if
--
if
a
party
in
interest
believes
that
there
is
an
asset
as
to
which
there
is
inconsequential
value,
they
can
seek
an
order
compelling
the
bankruptcy
--
compelling
the
trustee
to
abandon
that
asset
to
the
debtor.
so
there
is
--
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg's
question
--
there
is
a
mechanism
for
addressing
the
concern
that
your
honor
has
with
a
debtor
who
wants
a
determination
that
they
keep
a
particular
asset,
but--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
a
--
a
simpler
rule
would
be
that
if
a
debtor
wants
to
say,
i
have
an
in-kind
exemption
in
an
asset,
the
debtor
should
say
that.
they
should
use
a
term
that
is
understood
to
mean
that.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
well,
that's
exactly
what
the
debtor
is
contending
here.
she
--
the
debtor
here
is
saying
that
this
--
this
said
even
if
i'm
wrong
about
the
value--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
right.
here
the
debtor
was
told
at
the
341
meeting
that
the
trustee
intended
to
sell
it.
her
claim
is
that
even
--
even
if
he
can
get
more
value
than
she
said
it
was
worth,
she
keeps
all
of
that
value,
regardless
of
what
it's
worth,
because
--
because
her
schedule
told
us
unequivocally
that
she
got
to
keep
it
regardless
of
its
actual
value.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
but
the
best
reading
of
her
schedule
is
not
to
make
such
a
claim,
but
rather
to
read
her
schedule
to
--
to
mean
what
it
says,
which
is
that
she
claimed
to
have
a
$10,718
exemption
in
the
property,
and
insofar
as
the
property
is
worth
more
than
that,
that
that's
--
that
--
that
is
a
question
of
valuation,
which
isn't
the
subject
of
an
obligation
to
raise
an
objection.
also,
to
the
point
of
simplicity,
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
may,
the
--
the
virtue
of
the
rule
that
we
urge
here
is
that
--
that
it
does
provide
for
simplicity.
a
debtor
can
clearly
put
the
trustee
on
notice.
the
consequence
of
the
debtor's
rule
would
be
to
require
trustees,
whenever
schedules
happen
to
use
the
same
number,
to
come
in
and
file
pro
forma
objections.
and
it
doesn't
seem
that
there
is
any
reason
as
a
matter
of
bankruptcy
policy
or
statutory
construction
to
simply
require
more
paperwork
to
get
to
the
same
result.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
what
i
understand,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
that
--
the
answer
to
that
is
yes
and
that
in
the
third
circuit
following
this
decision
that
trustees
are
filing
those
kinds
of
pro
forma
objections.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
and--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--the
--
the
question
is
what
is
the
rule
where
--
where
there
remains
disagreement?
and
as--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--and
--
and--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
--no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
it's
just
different
from
what
the
--
what
the
statute
says.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
in
the
absence
of
an
objection,
the
property
claimed
as
exempt
becomes
exempt.
and
if
you
look
at
522(d)
and
see
its
description
of
the
property
that
becomes
exempt,
that
language
is
clear
that
it
is
the
debtor's
interest
up
to
a
dollar
amount
in
an
asset.
the
term
"property"
here
is
subject
to
monetary
caps.
it's
not
the
asset
itself.
and
the
statutory
language
in
that
regard
couldn't
be
clearer.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
well,
but
those
have
always
been
subject
--
as
this
court
explained
in
owens
v.
owens,
those
types
of
--
of
--
of
assets
have
always
been
subject
to
monetary
caps,
and
the
same
is
true
here,
and
522(d)
makes
that
clear.
insofar
as
the
debtor
would
like
to
keep
it,
the
debtor
is
entitled
to
credit-bid
at
an
auction.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
well--
mr.
craig
g
goldblatt
thank
you.
i
have
two
points,
one
practical
and
one
about
what
the
forms
here
mean.
first,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
task
of
liquidating
and
selling
the
--
the
assets
of
the
estates
is
the
work
that
is
done
throughout
bankruptcy
case.
mr.
brunstad's
suggestion
that,
historically,
that
there
was
--
the
deadline
applied
to
the
work
of
liquidating
the
estate
is
simply
incorrect.
and,
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
you
asked,
where
do
i
turn
to
find
out
how
hard
it
is
to
simply
extend
the
deadline?
the
answer
to
that
question,
with
respect
to
the
341
meeting,
is
page
7-7
of
the
u.s.
trustees'
manual,
which
says,
quite
clearly,
that
such
extensions
should
be
granted
only
under
exceptional
circumstances,
and
the
trustee
should
not
continue
the
341
meeting
when
the
debtor
appears
at
that
meeting.
so
that
we
have
a
real
practical
problem
of
basically
undermining
congress's
judgment
about
giving
the
trustee
adequate
time
to
liquidate
the
assets
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
with
respect
to
what
these
schedules
mean
and
whether
the
debtor
was
claiming
an
in-kind
exemption,
chief
justice
roberts,
you
had
it
right
when
you
said
--
you
know,
when
the
debtor
files
what
the
value
of
the
property
is
worth
is
unclear,
the
debtor
doesn't
know,
when
they
file,
what
