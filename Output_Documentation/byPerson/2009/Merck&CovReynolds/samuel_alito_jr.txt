justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
arguing
that
if
the
--
if
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
made
diligent
investigation,
they
would
have
uncovered
facts
about
the
safety
of
vioxx
that
the
fda
was
unaware
of?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
because
the
fda
never
took
any
action
during
this
period,
other
than
changing
the
label.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
actual
knowledge
means
things
that
the
plaintiff
doesn't
actually
know,
then
i
don't
know
what
the
difference
is
between
actual
knowledge
and
constructive
knowledge.
it's
a
meaningless
distinction
if
that's
how
actual
knowledge
is
defined.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
problem--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
is
wrong
with
the
--
with
the
inquiry
notice
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
set
out
on
pages
29a
to
30a
of
the
joint
appendix?
this
is
from
a
seventh
circuit
--
quoting
from
a
seventh
circuit
decision:
"the
facts
constituting
inquiry
notice
must
be
sufficiently
probative
of
fraud,
sufficiently
advanced
beyond
the
stage
of
a
mere
suspicion,
sufficiently
confirmed
or
substantiated,
not
only
to
incite
the
victim
to
investigate
but
also
to
enable
him
to
tie
up
any
loose
ends
and
complete
the
investigation
in
time
to
file
a
timely
suit.
"
so
that
the
statute
would
run
upon
inquiry
notice,
provided
that
within
the
2-year
period,
the
plaintiff
could,
if
the
plaintiff
diligently
investigated,
find
sufficient
facts
to
--
to
file
a
complaint
that
would
satisfy
--
satisfy
the
plra?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
your
--
your
position
is
that
the
statute
begins
to
run
at
the
time
when
a
--
a
plaintiff
is
--
has
constructive
knowledge,
at
least,
of
information
that
would
be
sufficient
to
file
a
complaint
that
would
satisfy
the
plra?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
my
question
--
why,
then,
did
congress
allow
2
years
after
that?
at
that
point,
the
plaintiff
has
everything
that's
necessary
to
file
a
complaint.
so
why
does
the
plaintiff
need
2
years
after
that
point?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
there
also
a
substantial
support
in
the
lower
court
case
law
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
provision
for
the
existence
of
inquiry
notice?
and
is
that
therefore
also
incorporated
into
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but,
under
your
position,
as
--
the
concept
of
inquiry
notice
becomes
essentially
very
unimportant,
if
not
completely
meaningless.
you
just
ask
at
what
point
would
a
reasonably
diligent
investor
have
obtained
knowledge
of
the
necessary
facts.
and
so,
what
difference
does
it
make
when
a
person
was
put
on
inquiry
notice?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
does
the--
