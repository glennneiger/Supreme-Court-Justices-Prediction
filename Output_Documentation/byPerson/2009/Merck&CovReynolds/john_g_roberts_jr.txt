what
would
you
--
what
would
you
--
what
phrase
would
you
use
to
describe
what
happens
when
inquiry
notice
culminates
in
finding
out?
you
have
to
say,
oh,
there
looks
like
there
might
be
scienter,
i
have
to
look
at
it.
and
after
a
year,
you
find
it;
yes,
there
was
scienter.
what
--
what
would
you
call
what
happens
when
they
find
out
there
was
scienter?

thank
you,

chief

john
g.

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

i
don't
understand
--
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
if
there
are
facts
that
would
cause
a
reasonable
person
to
inquire,
you
say
that
those
only
come
to
fruition
for
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitations
when
they
discover
it,
when
they
have
constructive
discovery,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
inquiry
notice
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
maybe
--
and
maybe
it
turns
out
that
you
could
find
them
within
a
week
and
maybe
it
turns
out
you
could
find
them
within
3
months
or
when
the
fellow
from
burma
is
released,
but
in
either
case,
it's
when
they
discover
it
or
should
have
discovered
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shanmugam,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer

our
opinion
in
case

vs
reynolds.
