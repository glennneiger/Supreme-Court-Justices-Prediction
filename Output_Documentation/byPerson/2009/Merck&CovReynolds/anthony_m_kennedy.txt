well,
but
if
we
had
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
we
had
that
kind
of
analysis,
where
the
--
where
the
company
has
to
reserve
all
of
its
defenses,
then
we
would
never
get
to
the
statute
of
limitations
problem.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
the
--
that
their
theory
of
the
case
is
correct.
we
have
to
--
to
assume
it
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes.
of
course,
you
deny
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
think
you
don't
get
--
get
very
far.
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me,
as
justice
stevens's
and
justice
ginsburg's
questions
indicate,
that
the
companies
can't
have
it
both
ways.
they
can't
endorse
the
twombly
case
and
then
say
just
an
inquiry
notice
of
a
general
--
of
a
general
nature
suffices.
you
have
to
have
specific
evidence
of
scienter.
and
there's
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
the
plaintiffs
had
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
on
--
on
--
but
you
have
you
to
say,
on
their
theory
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
not,
then
the
whole
storm
warning
theory
that
you
have
conceded
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
even
if
we
adopt
your
theory
of
the
case,
there
is
some
problem
with
the
allegation
that
there
was
fraud,
because
vioxx
did
not
--
because
merck
did
not
disclose
that
the
hypothesis
was
only
hypothetical,
and
the
fda
august
letter
made
that
clear.
so
it
seems
to
me
you
may
have
a
problem
as
to
that
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
again,
i'm
not
sure
we
would
parse
that
out
up
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
well,
you
mean
we
have
to
look
to
see
how
the
analysts
react?
