justice
sonia
sotomayor
counselor,
that
presumes
that
then
congress
is
using
unnecessary
words
when
it
differentiates
in
a
statute
between
discovery
of
facts
constituting
a
violation
and
a
different
statute,
like
section
13
or
77m,
however
you
want
to
call
it,
when
it
says
"due
diligence".
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
we
supposed
to
presume
that
they
like
using
unnecessary
words?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
answering
me
yes,
it's
unnecessary.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
you
tell
me
what
that
investigation
would
entail?
meaning,
you
started
by
saying,
go
talk
to
experts,
but
i'm
not
sure
what
talking
to
experts
would
have
added
to
the
market
mix
of
information.
you
either
pick
one
expert
who
said
the
theory
was
sound
or
one
who
didn't.
outside
of
publicly
available
information,
what
--
and
finding
it
--
what
other
inquiry
could
they
have
made
that
would
have
led
them
to
discover
sufficient
information
to
file
a
lawsuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
they
had
talked
to
those
lawyers,
is
there
anything
to
suggest
that
those
lawyers
had
more
information
than
the
ones
they
included
in
the
publicly
available
lawsuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
is
there
some
information
in
some
publicly
filed
lawsuit
up
until
the
time
of
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit
that
disclosed
more
information
about
scienter
than
existed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
could
you
tell
me
what
the
difference
is
between
actual
knowledge
and
constructive
knowledge?
because
as
i
read
the
amici
who
have
submitted
briefs
arguing
that
actual
discovery
should
be
our
standard,
they
appear
to
say
that
actual
discovery
or
actual
knowledge
includes
anything
that's
in
the
public
domain;
that
parties
are
presumed
--
and
we
have
plenty
of
cases
that
say
that
--
to
know
what's
out
there.
so
outside
of
that,
how
would
constructive
knowledge
or
constructive
discovery
be
any
different?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
would
require
the
shareholder
to
find
the
guy
in
burma?
or
to
go
and
attempt
in
every
case
to
engage
employees
in
dishonorable
conduct
by
talking
about
their
business
in
private,
company
business
--
as
i
understood
it,
we
were
asking
employees
to
engage
in
potentially
fiduciary
breaches?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
going
further
than
the
amici
are
suggesting.
the
amici
are
suggesting
--
and
assuming
we
accept
their
suggestion
--
that
it
should
be
everything
that's
in
the
public
domain,
which
seems
reasonable
to
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what,
in
addition,
do
you
think
constructive
knowledge
would
include
that
the
actual
knowledge
standard
doesn't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
putting
all
of
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
in
addition
to
that
would
it
include,
in
your
mind?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
so
you
are
conceding
amici's
point
that
actual
--
an
actual
knowledge
standard
is
the
same
as
a
constructive
knowledge
standard?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
--
can
you
tell
me
what
you
see
as
the
difference
between
the
two?
i
keep
going
back
to
what
the
amici
has
argued,
which
is
actual
knowledge
that
includes
knowledge
of
what's
in
the
public
domain,
under
the
theory
that
every
shareholder
is
presumed
to
know
what's
in
the
public
domain
because
that's
what
they
buy
with
and
that's
the
market
theory
of
securities
law.
so,
what
do
you
see
as
a
difference
between
the
two?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i
--
it
sounds
right,
but
give
me
a
practical
--
give
me
a
practical
example--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--of
what
you
are
talking
about,
where
--
where
an
individual
investor
would
have
something
that's
not
in
the
public
domain.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well
--
but
actual
knowledge
would
include
anything
the
investor
had
in
their
possession
because
that's
what
actual
knowledge
is;
i
have
it
in
my
possession
--
or
i
have
it
in
the
public
domain.
you
start
it
from
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
--
the
only
difference
then
would
be
information
the
individual
would
have
been
able
to
get
that
wouldn't
have
been
in
the
public
domain?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
so
we
are
in
agreement
that
on
a
fraud-on-the-market
case,
it
might
have
a
different
--
they
would
be
identical?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
suggesting
that,
in
an
individual
fraud
case,
the
inquiry
has
to
be
constructive
knowledge
because
there
could
be
things
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
you
are
admitting
that
you
filed
an
improper
complaint,
that
you
didn't
have
a
basis
--
a
good
faith
basis
for
the
complaint
you
filed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
if
you
had
a
good
faith
basis,
what
was
--
what
was
in
your
possession
that
gave
you
that
good
faith
basis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
--
whether
it's
a
legal
nullity
or
not,
answer
my
question
which
is:
you
had
to
have
a
basis
for
your
complaint.
what
was
in
your
possession
or
in
the
public
possession
that
gave
you
that
basis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
think
there
was,
because
you
filed
suit
a
month
after
that
study
in
2003.
