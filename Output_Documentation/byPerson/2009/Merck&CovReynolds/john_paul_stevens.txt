justice

paul
stevens
but
one
of
the
things
they
could
not
have
done
was
file
a
lawsuit
right
then.
is
that
correct?
because
they
would
not
have
had
adequate
facts
to
comply
with
the
rules
barring
plaintiffs
from
filing
suits
based
on
information
and
belief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
those
cases,
of
course,
the
statute
would
not
run.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
go
back
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
it
says
2
years
after
discovery,
and
you
argue
it
should
mean
2
years
after
he
should
have
discovered,
though
--
and
that
period
being
measured
by
a
date
from
inquiry
notice,
which
is
not
mentioned
in
the
statute
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
you
are
reading
as
though
it
meant
2
years
after
he
should
have
discovered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart,
you
are
talking
about
a
hypothetical
case
here,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
--
we
are
talking
about
this
particular
case.
does
the
inquiry
notice
contribute
anything
to
answering
the
question
when
this
plaintiff
or
the
--
the
class
of
plaintiffs
should
have
discovered
this
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
in
this
particular
case,
we
should
ignore
inquiry
notice
entirely?
