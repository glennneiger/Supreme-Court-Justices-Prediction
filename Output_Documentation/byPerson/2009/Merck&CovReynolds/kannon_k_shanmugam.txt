mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
of
limitations
for
private
securities
fraud
claims
incorporates
the
equitable
principle
known
as
the
discovery
rule;
that
is,
the
principle
that
the
limitations
period
begins
to
run
from
the
discovery
of
the
facts
constituting
the
violation.
under
the
discovery
rule,
a
plaintiff
who
suspects
the
possibility
that
the
defendant
has
engaged
in
wrongdoing
is
on
inquiry
notice
and
thereafter
must
exercise
reasonable
diligence
in
investigating
his
potential
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
erred
at
the
first
step--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
congress
did
say
that,
justice
sotomayor,
in
section
77m,
section
13
of
the
1933
act,
but
we
don't
think--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
we
don't
think
that
congress's
inclusion
of
that
express
language
referring
to
constructive
discovery
in
that
provision
was
significant,
and
that's
because
of
the
default
understanding--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
terms
of
the
application
of
the
rule.
and,
indeed,
there
are
cases
applying
section
13
of
the
1933
act
that
interpret
it
in
exactly
the
same
manner
that
we're
suggesting
the
court
should
interpret
section
1658(b)
in,
in
this
case.
and
that's
simply
because
the
default
understanding
has
long
been
that
when
a
statute
of
limitations
is
triggered
by
a
discovery
rule,
that
includes
both
express
and
--
both
actual
and
constructive
discovery,
and
with
the
exception
of
three
sentences
in
respondents'
brief,
the
parties
before
this
court
are
really
in
agreement
on
that
proposition.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
no,
justice
scalia.
we
believe
that
the
concept
of
constructive
discovery
itself
incorporates
the
specific
principle
of
inquiry
notice,
which
is--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
adopt
the
principle
of
inquiry
notice,
but
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
particularly
significant
additional
step.
and
that
is
simply
because
that
principle
has
likewise
long
been
understood
as
part
of
the
discovery
rule
with
regard
to
fraud
claims
specifically,
and
it
was
well
understood
to
be
part
of
the
application
of
the
discovery
rule
with
regard
to
securities
fraud
claims
specifically,
at
the
time
congress
enacted
section
1658(b).
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
that's
right,
and
at
least
where--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--at
least
where
a
plaintiff
fails
to
conduct
an
investigation--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--as
is
the
case
here--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
limitations
period--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
it's
true
that
at
that
point
the
plaintiff
discovers
the
remaining
fact,
and
so
to
the
extent
that
the
court
embraces
our
fallback
approach,
under
which
a
plaintiff
who
actually
exercises
reasonable
diligence
and
conducts
an
investigation
gets
the
benefit
of
additional
time,
one
can
essentially
embrace
and
codify
that
understanding
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
say
a
plaintiff
at
the
point
of
inquiry
notice
suspects
the
possibility
that
the
plaintiff
has
a
claim.
the
plaintiff
may
not
be
in
possession
of
information
bearing
on
each
and
every
element
of
the
underlying
violation,
but
if
the
plaintiff
at
that
point
exercises
reasonable
diligence
and
uncovers,
discovers
any
remaining
information--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--at
that
point
the
plaintiff
will
have
discovered
the
underlying
facts.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
right.
well,
just
to
be
clear,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
as
i
understand
respondents'
position,
it
is
that
the
alleged
misstatement
in
this
case
is
that
merck
made
misstatements
when
it
expressed
its
belief
that
the
naproxen
hypothesis
was
the
likely
explanation
for
the
disparity
in
cardiovascular
events
that
was
reported
in
the
vigor
study.
now,
as
a
first-order
response,
we
believe
that
there
was
considerable
information
in
the
public
domain
suggesting
the
possibility
that
petitioners
had
engaged
in
securities
fraud
when
they
made
those
statements.
at
that
point,
we
believe
that
respondents
were
on
inquiry
notice,
and
that
is
a
point
that
is
more
than
2
years
before
the
limitations
period--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--before
the
plaintiffs
filed.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
there
was
more
than
that.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
most
notably,
you
had
the
fda
specifically
accusing
merck
of
deliberate
wrongdoing
in
connection
with
its
public
representations
concerning
the
cardiovascular
safety
of
vioxx.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
but
the
fda
did
more
than
that
in
the
warning
letter.
it
accused
merck
of
misrepresenting
the
cardiovascular
safety
profile
of
vioxx,
and
it
accused
merck
of
minimizing
the
potential
of
cardiovascular
arrests--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--but
i
do
think
that
the
fair
reading
of
the
fda
warning
letter
is
that
the
fda
was
accusing
merck
of
intentional
misrepresentation.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
it
is
true
that
merck
continued
to
maintain
its
belief
in
the
naproxen
hypothesis.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
sufficient
somehow
to
toll
the
running
of
the
limitations
period.
such
an
approach
would
render
the
limitations
period
in
section
1658(b)
effectively
triggered
by
a
continuing
violation
theory.
but
i
do
want
to
get
back
to
your
question
about
what
more
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
have
done,
because
i
do
think
that
that
is
a
very
critical
question
here.
we
do
believe
that
there
was
sufficient
information
in
the
public
domain
to
cause
respondents
to
suspect
the
possibility
that
petitioners
had
engaged
in
wrongdoing.
at
that
point,
there
are
several
things
that
petitioners
could
have
done.
they
could
have
talked
to
experts
to
test
the
validity
of
merck's
naproxen
hypothesis--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
we
don't
believe
that
the
respondents
would
have
had
sufficient
information
to
file
a
complaint
then;
and,
indeed,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
they
still
don't
have
sufficient
facts
to
satisfy
the
pslra's
pleading
requirements.
and
i
think
it's
notable
in
this
case
that
respondents
really
can't
point
to
any
facts
that
came
into
the
public
domain
between
the
date
of
the
fda
warning
letter
and
the
date
in
october
of
2003
when
the
plaintiffs
first
filed
suit--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
somehow
provided
them
additional
information.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
right.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
it
may
very
well--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--it
may
very
well
be
that
the
plaintiffs
have
to
possess
at
least
some
information
bearing
on
scienter.
and
again,
under
our
fallback
approach,
where
a
plaintiff
suspects
that
a
defendant
has
engaged
in
securities
fraud
but
doesn't,
at
the
point
of
inquiry
notice,
possess
information
bearing
on
every
element
of
the
claim,
if
the
plaintiff
then
investigates,
the
plaintiff
will
have
the
benefit
of
additional
time
until
the
plaintiff
comes
into
possession
of--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--information
relating
to
scienter.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
that
there
are
at
least
a
couple
of
other
things
they
could
have
done.
one
thing
that
they
could
have
done
is
talked
to
former
merck
employees
and
consultants.
another
thing
that
they
could
have
done
is
talk
to
the
lawyers
who
had
filed
other
vioxx-related
lawsuits.
there
were
quite
a
few
as
of
the
inquiry
notice
date.
there
were
even
more
by
the
time
they
actually
filed
the
securities
fraud
complaint--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
there's
no
way
to
know,
of
course,
because
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
failed
to
conduct
an
investigation
at
all.
one
other
thing--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
would
say
that
the
very
fact
that
other
lawsuits
were
filed
that
accused
merck
of
making
intentional
misrepresentations
with
regard
to
the
very
same
statements
that
are
at
issue
here
actually
itself
constitutes
additional
information
that
should
have
put
the
plaintiffs
on
inquiry
notice
in
the
first
place--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
ginsburg,
the
market
did
respond.
we
don't
think
that
a
market
response
is
dispositive
for
purposes
of--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--inquiry
notice
analysis.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
a
brief
drop
in
response
to
the
fda
warning
letter,
a
substantial
drop,
but
the
stock
price
did
rebound;
and
a
longer
term
drop
over
the
course
of
2001
when
the
various
other
events
that
are
discussed
in
the
briefs
were
occurring.
so
i
think
that
there
was
a--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
the
fda
did
issue
the
warning
letter,
and
the
label
was
changed
to
incorporate
language
indicating
the
cardiovascular
disparity
from
the
vigor
study.
that
took
place
in
2002.
and
i
think
that
it
is
noteworthy
for
purposes
of
the
merits
of
this
case
that
the
fda
itself
thought
that
that
was
sufficient.
but
in
this
case,
respondents
seem
to
be
pointing
to
much
later
information
as
the
point
on
which
they
were
on
inquiry
notice.
they
seem
to
suggest
in
their
brief
that
they
were
not
on
inquiry
notice
until
as
late
as
2004
when
the
wall
street
journal
published
an
article
disclosing
certain
internal
e-mails.
now,
leaving
aside
the
sort
of
fundamental
embarrassment
to
their
position,
i
would
submit,
that
that
suggests
that
they
were
on
inquiry
notice
after
the
complaint
was
actually
filed.
i--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
there's
no
doubt,
justice
breyer,
that
the
easiest
rule
in
some
sense
for
the
court
to
apply
would
be
a
rule
that
started
the
clock
running
from
the
date
of
inquiry
notice.
but
when
you're
comparing
our
fallback
position,
a
rule
that
is
triggered
by
an
actual
investigation
by
the
plaintiff,
with
respondents'
rule,
which
looks
to
what
a
hypothetical
plaintiff
could
have
done,
i
really
do
believe
that
our
rule
is
going
to
be
much
easier
to
administer
because
respondents'
rule
by
definition
calls
for
speculation.
and
in
the
context--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
again,
justice
ginsburg,
the
fundamental
inquiry,
so
to
speak,
in
determining
whether
a
plaintiff
is
on
inquiry
notice
is
simply
whether
a
reasonable
investor
based
on
the
information
in
the
public
domain
would
at
least
suspect
the
possibility
that
the
defendant
has
engaged
in
securities
fraud.
and
a
plaintiff
need
not
possess
information
bearing
on
each
and
every
element
of
the
underlying
violation
in
order
to
be
on
inquiry
notice.
were
the
rule
otherwise,
the
concept
of
inquiry
notice
would
collapse--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well
--
well,
that's
correct.
but
this
court
has
never
tethered
the
running
of
the
limitations
period
to
the
ability
to
satisfy
any
applicable
heightened
pleading
requirements.
indeed,
to
the
contrary,
in
rotella,
this
court
held
quite
the
opposite--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
--
i'm
by
no
means
conceding
that
the
storm
warning
theory
doesn't
work.
i
am
simply
suggesting
that
a
plaintiff
need
not
possess
information
specifically
relating
to
scienter
in
order
to
be
on
inquiry
notice.
and
that,
we
would--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
there
are
certainly
going
to
be
cases,
justice
breyer,
in
which
a
plaintiff
frankly
can
never
get
to
the
point
where
the
plaintiff
can
satisfy
the
pslra's
pleading
requirements.
and
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--no.
we
certainly
don't
believe--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
that
in
understanding
the
term
"discovery",
justice
stevens
--
that
term
really
can't
be
meaningfully
understood
without
reference
to
the
common
law
against
which
the
statute
was
enacted.
and
this
court
in
interpreting
discovery
rules--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that's
right,
and,
again,
i
think
that
getting
to
the
point
of
"should
have
discovered"
is
a
fairly
modest
step.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
in
interpreting
the
discovery
rule
that
a
plaintiff
must
exercise
reasonable
diligence
in
order
to
invoke
the
rule's
benefits,
and
that
is
simply
because
the
discovery
rule
is
an
equitable
rule,
and
it
effectively
incorporates
the
principle
of
laches,
that
is
the
principle
that
a
plaintiff
who
sleeps
on
his
rights
is
not
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
equity.
indeed--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
no,
i
don't--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
court
did
choose
to
essentially
incorporate
the
language
from
--
it
was
section
9(e)
of
the
1934
act.
there
were
various
provisions
in
the
'33
act
and
the
'34
act
that
incorporated
discovery
rules.
and
that's
one--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
one
potential
difference
is
that
section
13,
section
77m,
refers
to
discovery
of
the
untrue
statement
or
the
omission.
but
i
think
more
broadly
with
regard
to
both
section
9(e)
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
1934
act
to
which
the
court
looked,
courts
had
actually
construed
those
provisions
as
reaching
both
actual
and
constructive
discovery
at
the
time
the
court
decided
lampf.
so
i
really
don't
think--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--no,
there
was
really--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--there
was
no
difference
between
the
two,
and
i
think
really
for
the
reasons
that
the
government
states
in
its
brief
as
well
as
the
reasons
that
we
state
in
our
opening
brief,
the
default
understanding
has
always
been
that
a
reference
to
discovery
includes
at
least
constructive
discovery.
and
a
rule
that
triggers
the
limitations
period
from
actual
discovery
would
have
significant
vices
because
it
would
give
plaintiffs--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
think
it's
an
open
question,
justice
sotomayor,
as
to
what
actual
discovery
would
--
would
actually
mean,
and
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
pretty
good
argument
that
you
don't
actually
discover
the
underlying
facts
until
the
plaintiff
himself
subjectively
actually
has
them
in
his
possession.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
it
does
--
constructive
knowledge
obviously
also
includes
information
in
the
public
domain,
and
we
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
on
inquiry
notice
precisely
because--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--of
that
information.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
for
purposes
of
the
inquiry
notice
analysis,
i
think
that
that's
all
you
look
to.
you
look
to
either
information
in
the
plaintiff's
possession
or
information
in
the
public
domain.
and
once
there
is
sufficient
information--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
would
hope
at
a
minimum
that
if
the
court
were
to
embrace
an
actual
discovery
standard,
it
would
look
to
information
in
the
public
domain,
precisely
because
otherwise
you
really
would
be
rewarding
an
ostrich
plaintiff
because
a
plaintiff
who
claimed
not
to
read
what
was
in
the
newspapers
could
have
the
benefit
of
additional
time.
but--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
again,
that's
not
how
i
would
ordinarily
understand
the
phrase
"actual
knowledge".
but
i
think
that
it's
important
to
remember
that
if
in
essence
the
standard
that
this
court
were
to
adopt
is
a
standard
that
does
not
start
the
clock
running
until
there
is
sufficient
information
in
the
public
domain
for
a
plaintiff
actually
to
plead
a
complaint,
that
would
radically
extend
the
limitations
period
for
private
securities
fraud
actions.
mr.
kannon
k.

no
circuit--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
think
i'll
answer
that
question,
and
then
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
i
think
the
only
problem
with
that
rule
is
that,
at
the
tail
end,
it
effectively
mandates
the
same
hypothetical
plaintiff
inquiry
that
respondents
suggest.
it
requires
a
court
to
attempt
to
assess
whether
a
plaintiff
could
have
discovered
the
remaining
information
within
a
2-year
period.
and
that
has
all
of
the
same
vices,
we
would
submit,
as
respondents'
rule
and
the
government's
rule.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
narrow
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
a
plaintiff
must
possess
information
specifically
relating
to
scienter
in
order
to
be
on
inquiry
notice.
and
really
under
any
standard
for
inquiry
notice,
there
was
abundant
information
in
the
public
domain
as
of
2001
at
least
suggesting
the
possibility
that
petitioners
in
this
case
had
engaged
in
securities
fraud.
now,
my
brothers
don't
really
dispute
that
proposition.
instead,
they
really
advance
two
other
options
for
interpreting
section
1658(b),
under
which
the
concept
of
inquiry
notice,
the
well-established
concept
of
inquiry
notice,
really
has
no
role.
my
friend
mr.
frederick
suggested,
at
least
in
cases
involving
alleged
fraud
on
the
market,
that
the
standard
really
should
be
an
actual
discovery
standard.
but
no
court
of
appeals
has
adopted
that
interpretation
of
section
1658(b),
and
as
a
practical
matter
that
would
dramatically
lengthen
the
limitations
period
for
private
securities
fraud
actions.
and
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
congress's
inclusion
of
a
statute
of
repose
makes
everything
okay.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
inclusion
of
the
statute
of
repose
suggests
that
congress
was
simply
particularly
concerned
with
the
inclusion
--
with
the
fact
that
plaintiffs
could
bring
stale
claims,
and
that
congress
in
no
way
intended
to
modify
the
traditional
operation
of
the
discovery
rule.
with
regard
to
the
suggestion
that
the
court
should
simply
adopt
a
constructive
discovery
rule
that
pays
no
heed
to
inquiry
notice,
which
is
the
standard
that
the
government
seems
to
be
advancing,
i
think,
first
of
all,
respondents'
difficulty
in
coming
up
with
a
date
on
which
constructive
discovery
occurs
in
this
case
simply
illustrates
the
problem
that
would
be
multiplied
a
hundredfold
if
that
standard
is
applied
nationwide.
and
where
a
statute
of
limitations
is
concerned,
one
needs
to
have
clear
rules
and
rules
that
courts
can
easily
apply
without
inconsistency.
i
do
think
that
that
rule
would
also
lead
to
abuse.
it
would
lead
to
the
abuse
of
the
ostrich
plaintiff
who
simply
lies
in
wait
and
waits
to
see
how
a
company's
stock
performs
before
bringing
suit.
and
make
no
mistake
about
it:
that
is
what
precisely
happened
in
this
case.
by
counsel
for
respondents'
own
admission
in
the
district
court,
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
in
2003,
before
the
withdrawal
of
vioxx
from
the
market,
was
triggered
by
a
disappointing
earnings
report
that
led
to
a
decline
in
the
stock
price.
and
one
can
expect
that
that
phenomenon
will
be
multiplied
if
such
a
hypothetical
plaintiff
inquiry
is
adopted.
in
this
case,
there
was
abundant
information
in
the
public
domain
by
virtue
of
the
fda
warning
letter
and
other
sources
as
of
2001.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
conducted
no
investigation
at
that
point.
and
this
court's
cases--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
plaintiff
may
not
have
suffered
an
injury
by
that
point,
but
it
is
clear
that
section
1658(b)
refers
to
the
facts
constituting
a
violation
of
section
10(b),
not
all
of
the
elements
of
a
private
cause
of
action.
so
congress
itself
contemplated
the
possibility
that
the
limitations
period
could
begin
to
run
before
the
loss
occurred.
and
if
i
can
just
say
one
thing
about
this
court's
cases
concerning
the
discovery
rule,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
my
friend
mr.
frederick.
this
court's
cases
make
clear
that
a
plaintiff
must
exercise
reasonable
diligence
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
discovery
rule.
indeed,
recently
in
klehr
in
the
context
of
civil
rico,
this
court
held
that
a
plaintiff
must
exercise
reasonable
diligence
even
to
invoke
the
doctrine
of
fraudulent
concealment--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--and
under
our
approach,
if
a
plaintiff
comes
forward
and
shows
that
the
plaintiff
exercised
reasonable
diligence
but
was
unable
to
discover
any
remaining
information,
the
plaintiff
will
have
the
benefit
of
additional
time.
thank
you.
