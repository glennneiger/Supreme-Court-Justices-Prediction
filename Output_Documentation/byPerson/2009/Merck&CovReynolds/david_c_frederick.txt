mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
congress
intended
the
word
1658
to
have
its
normal
and
well-established
meaning.
by
contrast,
merck
asks
the
court
to
add
concepts
to
section
1658
not
found
in
its
text
by
interpreting
the
word
2-year
limitations
period
to
be
triggered
when
facts
cause
an
investor
to
suspect
the
possibility
of
fraud.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
we
say,
at
the
first
part
of
our
submission,
that
the
court
can
decide
the
case
on
an
actual
discovery
--
actual
knowledge
standard.
we
have
gone
on
to
brief
constructive
discovery
because,
prior
to
1934,
in
the
numerous
state
statutes
that
use
the
phrase
"discovery
of
facts
constituting",
many
courts
had
adopted
a
constructive
knowledge
standard.
we
think
we
win
under
either
standard.
if
the
court
decides
this
is
an
actual
knowledge
case--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
a
fraud-on-the-market
case,
like
this
one,
where
an
efficient
market
is
pleaded,
there's
no
practical
difference.
in
an
individual
case,
where
the
securities
fraud
alleges
that
an
individual
investor
is
harmed
by
the
individual
actions
of
some
broker
or
some
other
person,
there
could
very
well
be
a
difference
in
terms
of
what
the
reasonable
investor
should
have
known
on
the
basis
of
information
that
would
be
available.
and
the
point
of
the
constructive
knowledge
standard
was
to
have
plaintiffs
not
rest
on
their
--
their
ability
to
hide
information,
but
to
be
diligent,
reasonably,
in
ascertaining
that
information,
and
the
constructive
knowledge
standard
really
came
to
address
a
case
different
from
the
case
that
we
have
here,
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--sure.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
would
be
information
that
the
--
the
broker,
for
instance,
would
have
made
available
to
the
investor,
that
the
investor
simply
didn't
look
at,
or
that
the
investor
could
have
asked
for,
but
--
but
never
followed
up
in
obtaining.
and
that
kind
of
constructive
knowledge
standard,
this
court
has
held
in
numerous
cases,
dating
back
to
the
19th
century,
is
an
appropriate
form
of
attributing
knowledge
to
a
reasonable
person.
and
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
--
kirby,
wood
--
those
kinds
of
cases
talk
about
what
a
reasonable
person
in
those
kinds
of
circumstances
would
be
imputed
to
know.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
through
reasonable
inquiry,
that
by
following
up
with
questions
to
the
broker
or
to
other
persons
associated
with
that
entity.
it's
a
different
theory,
concededly,
justice
sotomayor,
in
a
fraud-on-the-market
case,
which
is
what
this
case
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
could
be
actual
or
constructive,
depending
on
the
facts
and
circumstances,
but
the
important
point
to
draw
away
from
this
is
that
congress
also
wrote
in
a
5-year
period
of
repose
in
this
statute
and
followed
up
on
the
suggestion
of
the
lampf
dissenters,
who
believed
that
the
period
of
repose
was
too
restrictive.
so,
in
2002,
when
congress
amended
the
statute,
they
cited
the
lampf
dissenters
and
extended
the
period
of
repose,
which
created
an
absolute
bar
to
claims
of
fraud
being
brought
against
defendants.
the
statute
of
limitations
period
--
by
using
a
discovery
rule
--
was
intended
to
preclude
persons
from
resting
on
their
rights
and
not
taking
action
when
they
had
discovered
the
facts
constituting
the
violation.
it
was
not
intended--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--from
the
violation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
violation
would
be
a
material
misstatement
made
with
scienter.
and,
here,
what
we
assert
in
the
class
period,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
first
statements
that
were
made
with
scienter
were
those
statements
after
vioxx
was
put
on
the
market,
in
which
merck
touted
the
naproxen
hypothesis
as
an
explanation
for
what
it
asserted
to
be
a
cardio-neutral
effect
of
vioxx,
which
was
only
subsequently
--
there
was
empirical
evidence
to
--
tending
to
disprove
that
thesis.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
the
period
of
constructive
knowledge
of
all
of
the
elements
of
the
violation
would
have
occurred
in
november
of
2004
with
the
publication
of
the
wall
street
journal
article.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
i'm
saying--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--first,
let
me
say
that
the
first
complaint
is
now
a
legal
nullity.
it
has
been
superseded
by--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--shortly
before
the
filing
of
the
first
complaint,
there
were
public
releases
of
a
study
that
was
done
by
the
harvard
brigham
and
women's
study,
and
that
was
a
large
epidemiological
study
that
was
the
first
empirical
basis
that
disproved
an
aspect
of
the
naproxen
hypothesis.
naproxen
was
not
a
drug
studied
at
that
time.
but
what
the
study
showed
was
that
vioxx
and
celebrex
users
had
a
higher
rate
of
cardiovascular
incidents,
and,
in
fact,
vioxx
had
higher
than
celebrex.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
to
an
investor
who
was
following
this
information,
that
very
well
may
have
led
to
a
strong
inference
of
scienter
because
of
the
vociferous
denials
that
merck
subsequently
made
to
a
study
that
was
publicly
reported
as
being
funded
by
a
merck
grant.
now,
whether
that
would
have
met
a
post-tellabs
pleading
standard,
we
will
not
know
because
that
was
not
subject
to
that
kind
of
scrutiny.
we're
here
on
a
subsequent,
superseding
complaint
that
pleads
those
allegations,
and
we're
here
on
a
statute
of
limitations
argument
in
which
merck
attempts
to
argue
that
the
suit
was
filed
too
late,
rather
than
too
early.
obviously--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
but,
of
course,
at
that
time,
justice
ginsburg,
the
case
wasn't
about
the
pleading
standards
for
scienter
of
the
first
complaint.
it
had
long
since
gone
past
that,
and
the
fourth
and
now
the
fifth
amended
complaint,
which
merck
acceded
to
its
filing
in
the
district
court
after
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
is
now
the
operative
complaint,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
allegations
well
--
established
the
pleading
standards
for
scienter.
of
course,
that's
not
an
issue
before
the
court,
and
the
question
of
whether
the
first
complaint
was
premature
is
also
not
before
the
court.
but
the
fact
that
there
is
constructive
knowledge
only
on
the
basis
of
new
information
that
came
to
light
is
relevant
because
merck
cannot
point
to
a
single
fact
that
came
out
between
the
fda
warning
letter
and
the
file
--
and
2
years
before
the
filing
of
the
first
complaint,
so
that
narrow
window
between
september
2001
and
november
6,
2001.
and,
in
fact,
when
the
fda
expanded
the
uses
of
vioxx
in
april
2002,
it
approved
a
label
that
specifically
addressed
the
uncertainty
about
the
naproxen
hypothesis.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
that
was
the
general
rule,
prior
to
1934,
when
congress
first
wrote
those
words
into
the
federal
statute.
but,
justice
alito,
we
have
also
provided
information
to
the
court
of
a
case
in
the
19th
century
called
martin
--
this
is
on
page
25
of
our
brief
--
in
which
the
standard
was
seen
to
be
somewhat
lower
than
the
normal
pleading
standard,
and
that
is
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
believed
that
he
had
been
subject
to
fraud.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
the
legislative
reports
that
accompany
the
act
in
2002,
what
the
senate
described
in
its
report
was
a
concern
that
a
1-year
period
would
be
too
short
for
a
plaintiff
to
file
an
action,
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
then
gain
discovery
about
the
possibility
of
other
codefendants
who
had
participated
in
that
fraud.
this
was
the
era,
justice
alito,
in
which
enron
and
worldcom
exposed
to
the
world
the
complexity
of
vast
and
difficult-to-ascertain
frauds,
and
congress
was
seeking
to
extend
that
period
so
that
investors
would
have
an
opportunity
responsibly
to
bring
cases
that
would
ferret
out
that
fraud
and
to
get
at
all
of
the
people
who
might
have
participated
in
that
fraud.
that
was
the
explanation
that
the
--
the
senate
gave
for
that,
and
that
couples
with
the
action
by
congress
in
the
pslra,
which
was
intended
to
ensure
that
these
pleading
standards
would
be
well
investigated
and
well
ferreted
out
prior
to
pleadings.
the
2-year
period
was
intended
to
ensure
that
that
kind
of
action
would
--
would
take
place.
and
when
you
couple
that
with
the
5-year
statute
of
repose,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
simply
an
--
an
insurance
that
a
plaintiff
is
not
resting
too
far
on
information
within
its
possession
when
the
statute
of
repose
is
going
to
provide
absolute
protection.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
the
difference
--
here
is
the
difference:
we
accept
that
the
pleading
standard
rule
advocated
by
the
government
is
the
brightest
line
rule
and
that
this
court
should
adopt
it.
if
it
adopts
something
less
than
that
and
adopts
a
reasonable
person's
believing
that
fraud
had
occurred,
that
might
not
quite
meet
the
pleading
standards,
but
would
nonetheless
encapsulate
the
laws
that
existed
prior
to
1934,
and
we
would
prevail
under
that
standard,
too.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
do
agree
on
that.
and
the
difference
is
that
if
you
talk
to
the
person
in
burma,
justice
breyer,
you
may
not
get
enough
facts
to
get
a
pslra-compliant
pleading
on
file,
but
you
might
have
the
belief
that
a
fraud
had
occurred.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
our
position
is
that
the
pleading
standard
is
correct,
and
that
if
you
don't
adopt
a
pleading
standard,
something
a
little
bit
less
than
a
pleading
standard
--
their
standard
--
is
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
difference
--
the
space
between
our
the
position
and
the
government
is
really
quite
small,
and
it
rests
on
pre-1934
interpretations
of
"discovery
of
the
facts
constituting"
that
did
not
seem
to
tie
specifically
to
pleading
standards,
but
nonetheless
adopted
a
reasonable
person
standard
based
on
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
believed
that
fraud
had
occurred.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
this
was
brought
as
a
motion
to
dismiss,
justice
ginsburg.
most
times,
a
statute
of
limitations
defense,
which
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
defendants
have
the
burden
to
show
--
most
often
they
are
brought
as
motions
for
summary
judgment,
in
which
there
are
undisputed
facts
that
the
defendant
attempts
to
argue.
here,
i
think
what
the
third
circuit
was
holding
was
that,
this
is
not
proper
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
deny
it
as
a
motion
to
dismiss.
but
there
--
it
is
routine
in
the
law
that
where
there
are
motions
to
dismiss,
there
subsequently
are
facts
developed
and
subsequent
pleadings
brought.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
was
saying
anything
other
than,
this
is
the
normal
course
in
which
motions
to
dismiss
which
should
not
have
been
granted
would
be
allowed
for
further
percolation
by
the
case--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
think
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
you
can
in
these
ways,
because
the
market
had
no
reaction.
the
analyst
who
looked
at
the
fda
warning
letter
said
that
this
was
not
changing
their
information.
the
fda
has
said--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
that
was
part
of
the
factual
inquiry
that
merck
itself
submitted
as
part
of
its
motion
to
dismiss.
whether
the
court
treats
that
as
relevant
for
ascertaining
at
this
time
whether
to
affirm
the
third
circuit,
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach,
but
i
would
point
out
that
our
brief
goes
into
this
in
quite
some
detail,
that
the
publicly
available
information
made
clear
there
was
absolutely
no
market
reaction
that
would
have
led
any
person
reasonably
to
suspect
that
merck
did
not
honestly
believe
the
naproxen
hypothesis
that
it
were
positing
at
the
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
to
be
sure,
subsequently
information
came
to
light
that
brought
merck's
very
serious
fraud
to
public
attention.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
very
serious
fraud
that
had
significant
adverse
consequences
to
investors,
we
have
brought
suit.
but
it
would
be
the
height
of
irony
that
for
merck's
success
in
concealing
its
fraud
through
the
scientific
uncertainty
that
was
occurring
with
the
naproxen
hypothesis,
that
it
would
have
this
suit
thrown
out
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds
and
never
face
the
day
in
court
that
the
investors
here
expect
and
deserve.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
