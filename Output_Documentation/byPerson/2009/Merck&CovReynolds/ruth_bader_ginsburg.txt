justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
--
how
could
that
--
let's
descend
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
that
is
this
case.
the
story
that
was
being
put
out
is,
yes,
this
drug
may
produce
heart
attacks,
but
there's
no
indication
that
it
does
so
--
that
the
other
drug
that
it's
comparing
with
may
have
an
anti-heart
attack
element.
and
that's
accepted.
we
could
--
it
could
be
one
explanation;
it
could
be
the
other.
how
would
the
most
diligent
plaintiff
have
gone
about
finding
out
whether
merck
really
had
no
good
faith
belief
in
this
so-called
naproxen
hypothesis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
didn't
stop
it.
didn't
--
didn't
merck
submit
a
curative
label,
whatever,
and
the
fda
said
that
was
okay?
and
that
--
that
submission
continued
to
give
the
naproxen
hypothesis?
not
the
--
the
reason
that
we
are
seeing
this
heart
attack
thing
showing
up
is
that
the
other
drug
has
a
--
has
a
clotting
inhibitor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
when
--
when
there
were
--
doctors
across
the
country
were
continuing
to
write
prescriptions
for
this,
when
the
market
apparently
accepted
this
--
it
may
be
one
thing,
it
may
be
another
--
but
there
were
not
signals
from
the
market
itself,
and
the
medical
profession
seemed
to
be
going
on
and
writing
--
lots
of
doctors
were
writing
prescriptions
for
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
very
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
brief
drop,
but
it
came
right
back
up
again.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
say
that
because
of
one
--
one
element
of
the
claim
is
scienter,
that
there's
no
inquiry
notice
based
on
--
there
may
have
been
a
misrepresentation,
whether
it
was
innocent
or
deliberate,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
why
not
say
because
scienter
is
an
element
of
the
claim,
and
you
can't
get
your
foot
in
the
door
in
the
court
unless
you
can
plead
that
with
particularity,
that
it's
only
when
you
have
that
indication
that
you
have
what
you
call
inquiry
notice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
inquiry
--
it's
notice
of
what?
and
--
the
law
is
that
one
element
that
must
be
pleaded
with
particularity.
if
you
don't
have
that,
you
have
no
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
does
the
--
when
does
the
5-year
--
what
is
the
trigger
for
the
5-year
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
the
violation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
you
say
that
you
did
--
you
did
begin
this
action
even
before
that
point
was
reached
because
you
--
you
attribute
this
to
the
disclosure
of
the
internal
e-mails
in
the
wall
street
journal
article?
so
you
--
you
say,
well,
we
sued
even
earlier
than
--
than
the
point
at
which
we
had
evidence
of
scienter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
judge
sloviter
used
the
so-called
harvard
study,
it
seems,
in
her
opinion.
she
thought
that
that
was
the
point
at
which
you
had
enough
to
suspect
scienter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
before
you
--
you've
finished,
there's
something
puzzling
about
the
third
circuit
decision,
and
it's
that
judge
sloviter
says
at
the
end,
in
summary,
"we
conclude
that
the
district
court
acted
prematurely.
"
she
doesn't
seem
to
close
off
a
statute
of
limitations
defense.
it's
--
and
the
same
thing
on
page
48a,
footnote
17.
she
says,
this
--
her
conclusion
is,
"at
this
stage
of
the
evidence.
"
--she
doesn't
say
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
limitation
period
--
in
its
judgment
about
the
limitation
period
having
expired.
she
just
said
it
was
premature.
what
--
what
did
she
mean
by
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and,
mr.
stewart,
the
--
you
said
--
the
phrase
that
you
used
were
(1)
facts
constituting
an
alleged
violation
--
which
you
say
is
the
test
--
and
(2)
facts
evidencing
scienter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
long
as
the
stock
price
was
holding,
how
was
the
plaintiff
injured?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it's
true
that
everything
was
locked
up
internally
at
merck,
all
the
reasonable
diligence
in
the
world
would
not
have
uncovered
what
eventually
came
out.
