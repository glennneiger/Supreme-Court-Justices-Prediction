justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
--
i
take
it
the
point
of
general
principle,
as
opposed
to
this
case,
is
i
take
it
you
will
concede
the
following:
let's
imagine
on
january
1
some
investors
look
out
and
there
are
not
only
storm
clouds,
thunder,
whatever
you
want,
lots
to
put
them
on
notice.
so
then
the
statute
begins
to
run.
but
it
could
be
the
case
that
once
they
start
to
investigate,
there
is
a
key
element,
say
scienter,
the
only
evidence
for
which
would
take
them
an
extra
six
months
to
find,
because
it's
in
the
hands
of
a
person
who
is
in
jail
in
burma.
all
right?
[laughter]
so,
you
are
prepared
to
say
in
that
situation
the
statute
does
not
begin
to
run
on
january
1;
it
begins
to
run
on
july
1,
if
they
really
look
into
it.
but
if
they
don't
really
look
into
it,
then
it's
january
1.
that's
i
think
the
basic
difference,
as
i
gather,
between
the
sides,
or
one
major
difference
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
that's
correct,
why?
that
is
to
say,
it
seems
to
me
that,
in
treating
these
differently,
you
have
proposed
a
real
morass
for
courts
to
get
into.
did
they
really
investigate
on
january
1?
was
it
an
inadequate
investigation?
was
it
a
thorough
investigation?
along
with
the
difficulty
of
drawing
a
distinction
between
why
it
should
be
that
that
difference
should
exist,
why
not
just
apply
the
same
rule
to
the
investors
whether
they
really
do
investigate
or
whether
they
don't
and
in
both
cases
the
statute
begins
to
run
on
july
1,
not
january
1?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
he
would
have
to
file
a
complaint
possibly
before
he
has
enough
evidence
to
even
bring
a
case.
that
is,
suppose
my
guy
in
burma
is
going
to
be
in
jail
for
3
years;
he
can't
get
to
him
for
3
years.
now,
he's
going
to
have
to
file
his
complaint
before
he
could
have
the
evidence
that
there
was
scienter.
now,
that
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
is
there
a
difference
--
i'm
trying
to
get
these
terminological
differences
clear
in
my
mind,
and
i'm
not
quite
certain
of
the
difference
between
you
and
the
government.
if
you
go
back
to
my
--
my
burma
example,
i
think
both
you
and
the
government
agree
that
the
statute
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
you
find
this
person
in
burma.
but
now,
i'm
not
sure
you
disagree
about
--
whether
you
agree
or
disagree
about
this.
so
i
think
--
you
find
the
person
in
burma.
that's
6
months
after
you
had
all
the
other
indications.
now,
both
of
you
say
the
statute
begins
to
run.
you
would
say,
when
you
find
that
person
in
burma,
you
have
to
get,
through
him,
enough
information
to
be
able
to
file
your
complaint
now
in
respect
to
scienter.
but
the
government
would
say,
when
you
get
that
person
in
burma,
he
has
to
be
able
to
give
you
enough
storm
clouds,
in
respect
to
--
to
scienter.
is
that
what
the
--
is
there
that
difference?
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
no
difference,
then,
between
the
two
of
you,
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
do
you
think
--
you
think
the
standard
should
be
--
and
i
can
find
out
from
the
government,
and
i
will,
i
guess
--
that
it
should
be
--
that
you
have
to
--
a
reasonable
person
having
talked
to
the
guy
in
burma
would
walk
away
thinking,
fraud.
that's
the
standard;
you
think
they're
both
there
--
but
both
of
you
agree
you
have
to
find
the
guy
in
burma,
though
it
could
turn
out
that
other
features
of
the
case,
6
months
earlier,
would
put
a
reasonable
person
on
notice
to
begin
looking
for
somebody
in
burma?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
both
agree
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
you
want
to
say,
you
ought
to
get
enough
information
from
that
or
in
all
the
other
things
the
same,
so
that
you
have
--
are
able
to
file
the
complaint.
they
want
to
say
you
have
to
get
enough
so
a
reasonable
person
would
believe
a
fraud
had
occurred.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
so
worried
about
that.
i
know
there's
a
lot
less,
but
--
or
more,
whatever
--
but
i
am--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
--
how
--
what's
the
right
phrasing?
because
i
--
i
understood
that
inquiry
notice
has
somehow
made
an
appearance,
and
it
seems
to
confuse
me.
so
you
say
the
statute
begins
to
run
when
a
reasonable
person
would
have
found
facts
sufficient
to
show
a
violation
or
sufficient
to
permit
him
to
file
a
complaint
that
alleges
a
violation?
how
--
does
that
come
in
any
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
say
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
basically
in
agreement.
and
then
the
way
that
the
--
the
--
then
the
way
that
this
inquiry
thing
comes
in
is
that
sometimes,
perhaps
quite
often,
a
reasonable
person,
given
certain
facts,
would
begin
to
inquire.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
happened
to
be
a
case
where
inquiry
played
no
role,
then
it
wouldn't.
it's
all
a
question
of
what
a
reasonable
person
would
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
this
case
spoke,
this
is
upon
a
statue
of
limitations
that
requires
a
plaintiff
in
a
securities
fraud
action
to
file
a
complaint,
no
more
than
two
years,
no
more
than
two
years
after
the
plaintiff
?discover
the
facts
constituting
the
violation.
once
you
discover
the
facts
and
you
have
two
years
to
file
the
complaint,
it
can't
be
longer
than
that.
the
complaints
here
filed
a
complaint
to
plaintiff,
file
a
complaint
and
here
is
what
it
claims.
first,
merck
a
drug
company
created
a
drug
called
vioxx
it
was
supposed
to
be
painkiller
in
the
same
class
as
aspirin
and
naproxen
which
i
think
is
some
of
the
well
known
brand
name.
second,
merck
conducted
a
study
that
showed
among
other
things
that
people
who
took
vioxx
when
you
compare
it
to
the
naproxen.
once
you
took
vioxx,
it
showed
sometime
increased
risk
of
suffering
a
heart
attack.
then,
merck
argued
publicly
that
the
heart
attack
difference
and
it
wasn't
a
great
difference,
the
heart
attack
difference
might
reflect
the
fact
that
naproxen
helps
stop
heart
attacks.
it
was
naproxen
that
helps
to
stop
them;
it
wasn't
vioxx
that
helps
to
start
them.
that
was
called
the
naproxen
hypothesis
and
then
they
say
that
forth
all
the
time
merck
knew
that
vioxx
itself
created
an
additional
heart
attack
risk:
naproxen
or
no
naproxen.
so
it
was
the
naproxen
that
started
that,
that's
what
the
plaintiff's
claim.
then,
they
say
when
the
true
facts
came
out
which
they
say
they
were
facts
the
stock
price
of
merck
fell,
not
surprisingly
hurting
their
investments
and
entitling
these
plaintiffs
to
damages
for
securities
fraud.
now,
they
filed
a
complaint
saying
all
these
things
in
november,
early
november
2003.
merck
said,
well
november
2003
the
court
should
dismiss
the
complaint
because
it
was
too
late
and
the
question
that
they
presented
was
whether
the
plaintiff's
has
discovered
the
facts
constituting
the
violation
they
were
complaining
about
before
early
november
2001,
two
years
earlier
because
according
to
them
that
was
when
the
time
started
to
run.
if
that's
true,
the
plaintiffs
were
too
late.
the
district
court
agreed
with
merck,
it
said
it
was
too
late
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
agreed
with
merck
and
they
reversed
the
district
court.
we
now
agree
with
the
court
of
appeal.
we
think
the
plaintiffs
were
not
too
late;
we
think
they
filed
their
complaint
on
time.
in
reaching
our
holding,
we
interpret
the
statute
of
limitations
and
we
decide
several
matters
and
those
are
the
general
points
we
make
aside
from
this
case.
first,
the
phrase
in
the
statute
discovery
of
the
facts
violating,
constituting
the
violation
covers
both
what
the
plaintiffs
really
knew
and
also
what
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
known.
in
other
words,
what
these
people
discovered
in
front
of
us
and
also
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
discovered.
the
history
of
the
statute
and
of
statute
of
limitations
in
general
over
the
centuries
shows
that
statutory
phrases
of
the
kind
before
us
hold
plaintiffs
responsible
not
just
or
what
they
did
learn
but
also
for
those
things
that
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
learned.
second,
the
statute
includes
among
the
facts,
scienter
that
is
the
defendant
state
of
mind
for
example,
the
fact
that
a
defendant
knew
he
was
not
telling
the
truth.
it
includes
them
among
the
facts
that
a
plaintiff
has
to
have
discovered
before
the
two
year
limitations
period
begins
to
run.
third,
that
a
fact
that
plaintiff
learns
of
a
simple
possibility
of
fraud
is
not
enough
to
start
the
limitations
period
running,
where
some
times
a
possibility
is
such
that
it
could
lead
a
reasonable
plaintiff
to
investigate
further.
fourth,
the
facts
before
us
here
those
which
will
basically
uncontested
or
taken
by
the
lower
court
as
a
given,
they
do
not
show
that
by
early
november
2001
the
plaintiff
knew
or
should
have
known
the
facts
constituting
the
violation
that
they
alleged
in
their
complaint.
well,
that's
the
reason
basically
that
the
district
court
in
our
view
which
dismissed
the
complaint
as
being
file
too
late
was
wrong
and
the
court
of
appeals
which
held
that
the
complaint
was
filed
on
time
was
right
and
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
we
explain
all
these
highly
detailed
matters,
further
if
you'd
like
to
read
them
further
in
our
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment,
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
thomas.
