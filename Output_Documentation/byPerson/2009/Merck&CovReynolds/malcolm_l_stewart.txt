mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
its
terms,
section
1658(b)(1)
provides
that
the
2-year
period
of
limitations
will
commence
to
run
upon
discovery
of
the
facts
constituting
the
violation.
in
isolation,
the
word
"discovery"
could
refer
either
to
actual
or
constructive
discovery.
between
the
period
of
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
lampf
and
the
enactment
of
the
new
limitations
period
in
2002,
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
had
concluded
that
constructive
discovery
would
suffice,
and
we
believe
that
congress's
enactment
of
the
statute
tracking
that
language
constitutes
acquiescence
in
that
view.
nevertheless,
it's
noteworthy
that
the
statute
refers
to
facts
constituting
the
violation,
and
it's
absolutely
essential
to
this
court's
section
10(b)
jurisprudence
that
can
there
be
no
10(b)
violation
without
scienter.
scienter
is
an
essential
element
of
the
offense,
and
the
coverage
of
section
10(b)
would
be
dramatically
expanded
if
it
were
read
to
cover
innocent
mistakes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
were
certainly
frequent
references
to
the
concept
of
inquiry
notice.
there
was
not
uniformity
among
the
courts
of
appeals
as
to
precisely
what
role
inquiry
notice
would
play
in
the
analysis.
the
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
believed
as
we
believe
that
inquiry
notice
is
a
subsidiary
step
along
the
way
to
determining
when
a
reasonable
plaintiff
would
have
actually
discovered
the
facts
constituting
the
violation.
and
so
you
look
first
to
see
when
would
a
reasonable
person
have
become
suspicious,
and
then
you
ask:
once
the
reasonable
person's
suspicions
were
aroused,
how
long
would
it
take
to
complete
the
investigation
and
have
actual
knowledge?
and
that's
consistent
with
our
view.
there
certainly
were
courts
that
adopted
petitioners'
view
that
the
statute
began
to
run
at
the
time
of
inquiry
notice,
at
the
time
suspicions
were
aroused--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
you
are
right
that
that
is
the
ultimate
question
for
the
court:
when
would
a
reasonably
diligent
person
have
obtained
actual
knowledge?
the
concept
of
inquiry
notice
can
be
a
useful
subsidiary
step,
because
even
once
it
has
been
established
--
for
instance,
there
are
many
cases
of
this
court
in
which
the
plaintiff's
failure
to
exercise
reasonable
diligence
consisted
of
the
failure
to
look
at
documents
that
were
available
in
public
records
offices
or
corporate
records
that
were
open
for
inspection.
and
in
that
situation,
once
you
identify
the
point
at
which
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
commenced
to
look,
there
won't
be
a
very
long
gap
in
time
before
the
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
found
what
he
was
looking
for.
and
in
that
situation,
it's
really
integral
to
identify
the
point
of
inquiry
notice,
the
point
at
which
the
plaintiff
would
have
started
looking.
now,
the
fact
that
inquiry
notice
is
not
the
be-all
and
end-all
shouldn't
be
surprising,
because
it's
a
term
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute.
and
so
the
fact
that
it
ultimately
plays
a
subsidiary
role
in
undertaking
the
ultimate--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
we
--
under
our--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--under
our
standard,
the
--
the
individual
would
have
knowledge
of
facts
constituting
the
violation
once
he
had
facts
sufficient
that
if
--
if
alleged
in
a
complaint,
they
would
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they
would
establish--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
there
certainly
would
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
inquiry
notice
is
--
in
many
instances,
identifying
the
point
of
inquiry
notice
is
often
essential
to
identifying
the
point
at
which
a
reasonable
person
would
have
discovered
the
facts
that
would
support
a
well-pleaded
complaint.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
for
instance,
suppose
it
was
common
ground
that
there
were
records
available
in
an
admittedly
obscure
public
records
office,
and
that
a
plaintiff,
once
he
started
to
conduct
an
investigation,
would
find
those
records
within
a
week.
we
still
wouldn't
know
the
point
at
which
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
should
have
found
those
records
until
we
could
first
determine
when
would
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
have
started
looking,
and
that
would
be
the
point
of
inquiry
notice.
and
so,
it
might
be
that
at
a
certain
point,
the
plaintiff
had--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
but
we
--
again,
knowing
only
that
the
records
would
have
taken
a
week
to
be
discovered
once
the
plaintiff
started
looking,
wouldn't
tell
you
when
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
found
those
records,
unless
you
also
knew
the
date
on
which
the
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
begun
his
investigation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
typically
in
a
fraud
--
on-the-market
case,
inquiry
notice
will
really
tell
us
nothing
meaningful--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--because
the
whole
premise
of
the
case
is
the
market
as
a
whole
was
defrauded.
certainly,
a
reasonably
diligent
investigation--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
we
should
ask:
when
would
a
reasonably
diligent
investor
have
discovered
sufficient
facts
to
file
a
well-pleaded
complaint?
now,
constructive
discovery
does
still
play
a
role,
because
if
there
was
information
in
the
public
domain,
but
a
particular
investor
simply
didn't
read
news
reports,
didn't
follow
even
public
information
about
the
--
the
nature
of
what
was
going
on
with
vioxx,
that
person
wouldn't
be
shielded
from
the
running
of
the
limitations
period
simply
because
he
didn't
have
actual
knowledge.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
i
think
if
you
read
tellabs
as
a
construction
of
this
statute,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
our
view.
but
the
tellabs
court
was
talking
about
something
else.
it
was
construing
the
heightened
pleading
requirements
of
the
pslra.
now,
the
pslra
pleading
requirements
do
distinguish,
in
adjacent
subsections,
between
the
requirement
that
a
plaintiff
plead
with
particularity
the
specific
statements
that
are
alleged
to
be
false
or
misleading
and
the
reason
that
they
are
false
and
misleading,
on
the
one
hand
--
that's
in
subsection
(1)
--
and
then,
in
subsection
(2),
it
requires
also
to
be
pleaded
with
particularity
the
facts
that
establish
strong
inference
of
scienter.
and
the
court
in
tellabs
used
the
term
(1);
namely,
you
have
to
plead
with
particularity
facts
about
the
alleged
misstatement
and
why
it's
misleading.
the
statute
itself,
the
pslra,
does
not
use
the
term
"facts
constituting
the
violation"
to
describe
the
first
category.
and
the
word
10(b)
naturally
encompasses
both
what
the
defendant
did
and
what
his
state
of
mind
was.
the
other
thing
we
would
say
--
two
other
things
we
would
say
in
that
regard
are,
first,
as
the
introductory
language
of
section
1658(b)
points
out,
this
limitations
period
only
applies
to
suits
in
which
the
plaintiff
alleges
misconduct
involving
fraud,
deceit,
manipulation,
or
contrivance.
and
so,
the
limitations
period
is
limited
to
violations
that
have
scienter
as
an
element.
and,
therefore,
it
would
be
particularly
peculiar
to
think
of
a
violation
as
not
encompassing
the
fact
of
scienter.
the
other
thing
we
would
say
--
and
justice
scalia
was
asking
earlier
about
the
differences
between
78i(e)
and
77m
--
and
there
are
really
too
salient
differences.
the
first
is
that
77m
is
explicit
in
providing
that
constructive
as
well
as
actual
discovery
will
suffice.
and
we
think
that
1658(b)(1)
is
properly
read
to
encompass
constructive
discovery,
even
though
it
doesn't
say
so
in
so
many
words.
but
the
other
salient
difference
is
that
the
period
in
77m
doesn't
commence
to
run
by
its
terms
upon
discovery
of
the
violation
or
the
facts
constituting
the
violation.
the
statute
says
discovery
of
the
false
or
misleading
statement
or
omission.
that's
natural
in
77m,
because
77m
deals
with
violations
that
don't
have
scienter
as
an
element.
but
if
this
court
had
incorporated
that
language,
it
would
have
given
the
impression
that
knowledge
of
scienter
was
not
sufficient
--
was
not
required.
