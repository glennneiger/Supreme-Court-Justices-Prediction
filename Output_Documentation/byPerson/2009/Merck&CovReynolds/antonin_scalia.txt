but
you
want
to
go
beyond
constructive
discovery?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
there's
a
line
between
constructive
discovery
--
constructive
discovery
asks,
when
should
you
have
known?
and
the
rule
you
are
arguing
for
is
something
beyond
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
your
rule,
what
happens
when
you
are
put
on
inquiry
notice?
that's
the
point
at
which
you
should
be
conducting
additional
investigation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
where
the
--
statute
begins
to
run,
at
the
point
when
you
should
have
conducted
additional
investigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
say
that,
you
must
believe
that
there
is
substantial
evidence
of
fraud
when
there
is
simply
substantial
evidence
of
inaccuracy,
without--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
any
evidence
of
scienter.
what
evidence
of
scienter
was
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
deliberate
wrongdoing
--
as
i
understood
that,
it
was
simply
you
didn't
give
adequate
weight
to
the
--
to
the
other
--
to
the
other
side
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
means
it's
--
that
means
it's
wrong.
you
can
misrepresent
something
without
having
scienter
to
defraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shanmugam,
in
lampf
we
--
we
had
to
choose
between
what
statute
of
limitations
provision,
federal
one,
we
thought
applied.
and
we
had
two
choices:
one
was
section
77m,
which
reads:
"after
such
discovery"
--
"after
the
discovery
of
the
untrue
statement
or
the
omission
or
after
such
discovery
should
have
been
made
by
the
exercise
of
reasonable
diligence.
"
that
was
one
choice.
the
other
choice
was
78i(e),
which
simply
said:
"unless
brought
within
one
year
after
the
discovery
of
the
facts
constituting
the
violation.
"
no
statement
of
"or
after
it
should
have
been
made
by
the
exercise.
"
okay?
we
chose
the
latter
in
lampf.
now,
you
are
telling
me
that
there
was
no
choice
between
the
two,
that
--
that
"after
discovery"
always
means
after
discovery
was
made
or
after
it
should
have
been
made?
what
were
we
doing
in
lampf,
spinning
our
wheels?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
read
this
--
this
statute
--
and
1658
tracks,
not
77m,
which
says
"after
discovery
should
have
been
made.
"
it
tracks
78i(e),
which
says
"after
discovery".
now,
to
me
that
means
after
discovery,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
tell
me
what
the
difference
it
was
between
77m
and
77i(e)?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
difference,
unless
it
was
that
77m
--
i'm
sorry,
78i(e)
--
absolutely
required
knowledge?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
was
no
difference
between
the
two--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
we
were
just
wasting
our
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
adding
--
you're
adding
concepts
to
it,
as
well.
nobody
arguing
before
us
intends
discovery
to
mean
actual
discovery.
your
--
you
say
constructive
knowledge
is
enough;
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
prove
scienter,
though.
