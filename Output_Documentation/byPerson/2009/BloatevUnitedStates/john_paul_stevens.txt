mr.
roberts--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you,
mr.
roberts,
to
comment
on
your
opponent's
argument
that
you
are
creating
a
rule
that
if
a
particular
district
has
a
standing
order
that
motions
be
filed
after
seven
days
and
then
another
district
has
a
standing
order
that
it
be
21
days,
the
effect
of
your
rule
would
be
to
make
the
seven-day
district
an
86-day
--
give
them
86
days
under
the
speedy
trial
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
for
response
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
automatically
excluded,
so
that
won't
affect
the
--
well,
like
you
said,
it's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
difference
is
specifically
authorized
by
congress?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
it
seem
fairly
clear
that
the
district
which
has
a
21-day
rule,
they
won't
have
to
--
normally,
they
won't
need
extra
time
in
the
routine
case
for
an
extra
motion,
whereas
the
districts
with
a
seven-day
rule
would
pretty
automatically
need
another
10
days
or
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
repeat
that
just
so
i
have
you:
it
comes
under
(h)(1)
--
what
sub?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
what
--
what
subsection
does
all
this?
i
really
--
i
got
lost
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
you
agree,
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
not
covered
by
(d).
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
subsection
does
cover
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
not
governed
by
any
lettered
subsection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
no
period--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no
subsection
talks
about
another
proceeding?
that's
just
your
gloss
on
the
statute;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just
one
quick
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
described
in
(7)(a)
would
fit
your
description
of
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
tough
argument.
