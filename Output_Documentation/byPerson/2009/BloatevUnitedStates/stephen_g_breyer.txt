justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
--
how
do
you
think
it
should
work?
it
seems
to
me
they
are
two
separate
things.
on
september
7th,
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
"judge,
you've
told
me
i
have
to
have
everything
ready
by
the
13th.
"
"i
would
like
additional
time
to
prepare.
"
and
what
he
said
was,
25th>
["].
he
said
that
on
the
13th:
25th>
["].
this
is
what
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
asking,
in
part.
now,
what
the
judge
did
is
excluded
everything
from
september
7th
all
the
way
to
october
4th.
and
if
i
understand
your
argument
--
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
it,
but
on
the
7th
to
the
13th,
that
really
wasn't
additional
time,
but
nonetheless,
maybe
there's
something
there.
what
about
the
period
from
the
25th
to
the
4th?
i
don't
know
what
the
theory
could
be
on
excluding
that
one,
because
what
the
defendant
said
on
the
7th
--
on
september
13th,
he
said,
"judge,
i
don't
want
any
more
time.
"
"i
don't
even
want
to
file
any
motions.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
on
the
25th,
he
said
that.
so
what
is
the
basis
of
excluding
the
25th
to
the
4th?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
i
understand.
you
get
the
period
from
the
--
the
25th
to
the
4th
comes
under
(d)
or
(h).
it's
a
motion
that
is
filed,
and
it's
under
advisement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
comes
under
(d)
or
(h).
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
little
(h)(1).
i
mean
big
(h).
it's
attributed
to
a
period
during
which
any
proceedings
actually
under
any
advisement
--
or
maybe
it
comes
under
(d)
--
a
motion
not
to
file
a
motion
is
a
motion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
right,
(d)
has
a
special
time
limit
built
into
it
--
i
mean,
(h)
or
whatever
the
number
is
now.
it
says
not
to
exclude
30
days.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
none
of
the
others
do.
so
i
would
say
right
there,
congress
doesn't
want
the
judge
to
have
it
for
more
than
30
days.
congress
doesn't
say
a
word
in
any
of
the
others
that
says
anything
about
preparation
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
know.
but
there
is
not
an
indication
about
preparation
time.
their
argument
is
a
literal
argument
under
the
statute.
is
it
from
other
proceedings?
yes,
we
know
that
because
of
(d),
okay?
does
it
result
from
other
proceedings?
yes,
because,
in
fact,
the
preparation
time
is
a
direct
result
of
the
other
proceedings
as
defined
in
(d).
therefore,
it
is
an
ancillary
matter
related
to
other
proceedings
that
was
caused
by
the
other
proceedings.
qed,
their
argument
is
literal
and
there
is
no
policy
against
it.
that's
what
they
said.
now,
as
soon
as
you
get
to
the
last
(h),
you
would
find
a
big
policy
against
it.
called
not
exceeding
30
days.
now,
i
take
it
that's
roughly
their
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
least
my
interpretation
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
six
days
make
a
difference
to
your
case?
if
they
lose
six
days,
do
you
win?
