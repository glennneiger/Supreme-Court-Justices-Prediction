is
it
clear
that
a
period
of
time
attributable
to
a
defense
request
for
time
to
prepare
pretrial
motions
can
fall
within
(h)(7)?
because
(h)(7)
speaks
of
a
continuance.
isn't
that
a
very
--
wouldn't
that
be
a
very
odd
use
of
the
word
"continuance"?
if
you
make
an
application
to
a
judge
for
time,
additional
time
to
prepare
pretrial
motions,
do
you
say,
"i
want
a
continuance
of
the
date
on
which
my
pretrial
motions
are
due?
"
justice
samuel

alito,

well,
there's
--
but
the
courts
of
appeals
have
almost
universally
read
(h)(1)(d),
or
overwhelmingly
read
(h)(1)(d)
to
apply
in
this
situation
as
well.
i'm
sorry.
not
(h)(1)(d),
but
the
introductory
phrase.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
rule
that
you
are
arguing
for
really
will
accomplish
nothing,
other
than
to
benefit
a
small
set
of
defendants
who
--
who
got
pretrial
preparation
time
in
reliance
on
court
of
appeals
decisions
saying
that
those
could
be
done
without
making
explicit
ends
of
justice
findings
on
the
record?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
is
the
public
going
to
benefit
if
all
the
judge
needs
--
presumably,
district
judges
are
not
granting
these
extensions
of
time
in
situations
in
which
they
do
not
think
that
the
ends
of
justice
are
served
by
granting
the
extension
of
time.
so
what
is
going
to
be
served
by
requiring
them
to
recite
this
--
to
make
this
rote
recitation
on
the
record?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
does
that
show,
because
the
disposition
time
isn't
going
to
be
the
same
from
district
to
district?
districts
vary.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
congress
could
have
required,
as
they
have
in
some
instances,
to
have
a
judge
decide
a
matter
within
a
certain
period
of
time.
they
didn't
do
that,
did
they?
