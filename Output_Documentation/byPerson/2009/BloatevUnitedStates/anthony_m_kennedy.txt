justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me
how
it
works
in
district
courts?
this
district
court
set
september
13
originally
for
the
--
for
the
motion.
do
the
district
courts
generally
have
a
custom
schedule
for
every
case
where
they
set
times
or
do
they
have
local
rules
on
the
subject?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
--
that's
part
of
--
that
there
in
the
local
rule
of
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that
isn't
--
that
that
argument
doesn't
cut
both
ways.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
if
that
--
if
you
have
a
district
where
you
have
five
days,
a
very
short
period
and
almost
nobody
can
comply
with
it,
then
maybe
that's
an
argument
for
the
government's
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
an
assumption
in
your
mathematical
analysis
is
that
there
will
be
a
difference
in
the
time
that
it
takes
to
dispose
of
the
motion.
if
the
time
to
dispose
of
the
motion
is
the
same,
then
you
are
wrong,
i
think.
i
will
work
it
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
your
systemic
concern
with
the
--
with
the
government's
rule?
the
judge
has
to
grant
the
continuance
under
either
--
under
either
of
your
rules,
and
you
say
he
has
to
make
a
finding
that
it's
good.
but
are
you
concerned
the
continuance
would
be
because
the
attorney
wants
to
play
golf
or
take
a
vacation
with
his
kids,
and
that
that's
not
the
cause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that's
what's
driving
your
concern?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
wouldn't
judges
in
many
cases
do
that
anyway
just
in
the
course
of
deciding
whether
to
grant
a
continuance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
give
--
give
me
the
consequences
of
ruling
for
the
government
that
you
see
that
are
adverse
in
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
my
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
the
district
judge
will
ask.
or
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
do
you
doubt
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
for
my
--
just
for
my
information,
what's
a
motion
to
--
to
waive?
i
mean,
why
does
he
need
permission
to
waive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see.
