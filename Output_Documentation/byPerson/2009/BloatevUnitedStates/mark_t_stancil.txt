mr.
mark
t.
stancil
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
pretrial
motion
preparation
time
is
not
automatically
excluded
under
section
3161(h)(1)
of
the
speedy
trial
act.
such
delays
are
subject
to
exclusion
only
on
a
case-by-case
basis
under
(h)(7).
i
would
like
to
focus
today
on
three
features
of
the
statutory
text
that
make
that
abundantly
clear.
first
and
foremost,
when
crafting
(h)(1)
congress
specifically
addressed
pretrial
motion
delays
and
precisely
defined
that
exclusion.
subparagraph
(d)
declares
that
the
exclusion
shall
begin
with
the
filing
of
the
motion
and
end
with
the
hearing
on
or
other
prompt
disposition
of
the
motion.
reading
the
general
language
in
(h)(1)
to
encompass
preparation
time
would
circumvent
the
deliberate
legislative
choice
to
limit
the
pretrial
motion
exclusion.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
the
government's
motions
and
the
defense
motions
are
treated
equally
under
(h)(1),
which
is
why
the
government's
rule
to
treat
defense
motions,
or
defense
requests
for
additional
time
differently--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--the
exclusion
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the
exclusion
begins
with
the
filing
of
the
motion,
be
it
the
defense
motion
or
the
government's
motion.
that
is
clear
on
the
text,
the
face
of
the
text
of
the
statute,
which--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
our
position.
the
clock
runs
up
until
the
moment
of
filing.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
whether
it
is
a
defense
motion
or
a
government
motion.
so--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
their
response
to
the
motion,
it
is
tolled
--
or
the
clock
stops
during
the
preparation
of
the
response
by
either
side.
and
that
was
a
deliberate
legislative
choice
by
congress.
it
says
--
on
the
face
of
(h)(1),
it
says
the
clock
stops
at
filing
and
remains
stopped
through
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
or
other
prompt
disposition
of
the
motion.
that
was
an
express
choice
by
congress.
it
was
not
lost
on
them
that
a
response
time
would
be
treated
differently.
and
the
government's
suggestion
that
that,
therefore,
means
we
should
factor
back
in
preparation
time
is--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--it
is
too
late
because
this
court
answered
that
question
--
that
very
question
in
zedner
and
held
that
an
(h)(7)
ends
of
justice
finding
cannot
be
supplied
retrospectively
on
remand.
that
was
the
precise
question
put
to
this
court
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
unanimously.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
zedner
says
that
as
long
as
it
is
made
--
or
the
latest
it
could
be
made
is
the
time
by
which
the
district
court
rules
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
speedy
trial
--
on
speedy
trial
grounds.
so
it
can
be
made
in
the
district
court
up
until
the
time
the
district
court
decides
the
speedy
trial
motion.
it
does
not
--
at
least
it
is
left
open
in
zedner.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
remanded
with
instructions
to
dismiss.
however,
the
district
court
--
it
remains
for
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
to
dismiss
with
or
without
prejudice
according
to
the
factors
specified
in
the
act.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
think
that's
not
an
unusual
reading
of
the
term
"continuance",
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
frequently
--
trial
counsel
will
frequently
ask
for
a
continuance
of
the
date.
but
what
i
think
both
parties
agree
is
that
that
is
how
the
courts
almost
universally
interpret
(h)(7),
that
any
time
that
is
excluded,
even
if
it
doesn't
result
in
the
moving
of
the
trial
date
per
se,
is
treated
as
an
(h)(7)
exclusion--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
rule
wasn't
confined
to
pretrial
motions.
so
even
in
those
jurisdictions
that
follow
the
majority
position
at
issue
here,
also
to
my
understanding
use
(h)(7)
to
exclude
intermediate
delays
before
trial.
in
fact,
in
the
government's
brief,
the
government
acknowledges
that
courts
treat
pretrial
motion
delays
under
either
(h)(1)
or
(h)(7),
and
more
specifically
(h)(7)(b)(iv),
which
specifically
speaks
in
terms
of
preparation.
and
in
fact,
that's
still
further
evidence
that
congress
specifically
contemplated
that
preparation
time
would
go
under
(h)(7).
both
(h)(7)(b)(ii)
and
(h)(7)(b)(iv)
specifically
direct
district
courts
to
consider
the
need
for
additional
time
for
adequate
or
effective
preparation.
and
justice
alito,
back
to
your
concern
specifically
with
motions.
(b)(ii)
specifically
refers
to
pretrial
proceedings.
so
i
think
there,
in
that
sense,
there
is
evidence
that
congress
didn't
think
that
a
continuance
under
(h)(7)
would
refer
only
to
a
continuance
of
the
trial
date.
at
least,
that's
--
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
court
--
and
congress
did
decide
to
expand
or
clarify
the
end
point
and
beginning
point
of
the
(h)(1)(d)
exclusion.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
reverse--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--not
in
a
speedy
trial
context,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
is
not
a
proceeding.
there
is
no
pretrial
proceeding
until
the
motion
is
filed.
that
is
--
that
is
the
definition
of
a
pretrial
motion
proceeding.
it
is
a
formal
initiation
before
the
district
court.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
if
that
were
correct,
your
honor,
then
preparing
your
witnesses
is
a
proceeding
respecting
trial.
i
think
that
takes
"proceeding"
and
expands
it
so
that
everything
would
be
excludable
delay.
but
if
--
if
i
may
return
to
your
original
question,
congress
did
look
at
preparation
time
when
drafting
(h)(1)
and
(h)(1)(b)
specifically--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--pardon
me.
yes,
the
senate
judiciary
committee
specifically
considered
a
proposal
by
the
government
no
less
to
include
preparation
time,
and
the
committee
rejected
that
proposal
as
unreasonable.
i
think
this
is
simply
not
a
case
in
which
we
are
left
to
guess
whether
preparation
time
was
on
the
table.
it
was
on
the
table
and
it
was
declared
unreasonable
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
within
the
automatic
exclusion.
moreover,
i
think
that
makes
abundant
sense.
it
is
not
the
case
that
simply
asking
for
more
time
necessarily
means
that
you
have
some
prejudice
in
the
speedy
trial
context,
or
even
that
the
trial
date
necessarily
would
move.
in
this
case,
the
counsel
requested
the
extension
for
pretrial
motions.
that
extension
was
granted.
the
trial
date
held.
it
wasn't
moved
until
much
later,
under
an
(h)(7)
exclusion
on
unrelated
grounds.
so
i
think
it's
a
--
i
think
it's
a
false
--
a
red
herring,
if
you
will,
for
the
government
to
suggest
that
when
the
defendant
asks
for
something,
it's
necessarily
--
it
ought
to
be
granted,
fair
enough,
but
that
it's
necessarily
going
to
prejudice
the
speedy
trial
calculation.
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
the
case.
i
think
ordinarily,
these
things
will
come
very
early
in
the
speedy
trial
--
speedy
trial
clock,
and
there
will
be
relatively
brief
delays.
and
so
i
think
it's
quite
reasonable
to
think
that
district
courts
could
be
allowed
to
give
more
flexible
preparation
time
to
decide
whether
to
file,
what
to
file,
and
then
the
exclusion
starts
with
the
filing.
and
i
think
congress
has
made
that
abundantly
clear
in
--
on
the
text
of
the
statute.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
disagree,
your
honor.
first,
i
think
courts
will
granted
them
when
necessary.
again
because
it
is
early
in
the
clock,
there
won't
necessarily
be
speedy
trial
--
some
sort
of
speedy
prejudice
to
the
government.
but
moreover,
all
this
means
is
that
the
court
needs
to
put
findings
on
the
record
to
say
this
is
preparation
time
that
is
legitimately
needed,
the
defendant's
interests
here
outweigh
the
public's
interest,
and
so
i'm
going
to
grant
that
and
i'm
going
to
put
those
findings
on
the
record.
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
statute
that
that's
how
congress
anticipated
this
would
work.
but
i--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
think
--
i
don't
believe
that
precise
question
has
come
to
the
court.
but
courts
are
very
permissive
in
terms
of
how
much
needs
to
be
put
on
the
record,
and
it's
my
understanding
that
this
happens
quite
literally
every
day
in
scores
of
contexts
where
courts,
as
long
as
they
make
the
finding,
it
is
reviewed
for
an
abuse
of
discretion
only
and
that's
sufficient.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
if
we
are
correct,
the
decision
will
have
significant
effect
on
the
public's
interest.
in
fact,
an
individual
defendant
has
very
little
to
gain
from
such
gamesmanship
as
the
government
suggests
would
be
at
issue.
what
you
get
is
a
dismissal
of
your
indictment
with
or
without
prejudice,
and
there
are
no
statute
of
limitations
problems--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--first,
your
honor,
it's
not
rote.
it
specifies
four
factors
that
they
have
to
consider,
including
and
before,
it
says,
whether
its
time
--
the
time
is
necessary
for
effective
preparation,
taking
into
account
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
what
this
--
what
putting
this
under
(h)(7)
and
making
that
process
required
will
do
is
weed
out
the
very
worst
sorts
of
delays
where
counsel,
even
for
the
defendant
or
the
government,
comes
in
and
asks
for
the
delay
without
the
exercise
of
due
diligence
and
without
any
showing
that
this
is
actually
necessary.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what
congress
was
doing
by
not
putting
this
under
the
automatic
exclusion
in
(h)(1).
if
it's
automatically
excluded,
and
there
is
additional
time
granted
for
no
reason
whatsoever
or
for
something
that
wouldn't
meet
the
due
diligence
standard
in
(b)(iv),
the
speedy
trial
clock
is
effectively
lengthened
automatically.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
with
respect
to
pretrial
motions
specifically?
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
it
varies
widely
from
district
to
district.
for
example,
in
some
districts
the
default
is
21
days.
so,
if
you
try
a
case
in
chicago,
you
go
to
arraignment,
your
pretrial
motions,
unless
set
by
a
different
rule,
are
due
in
21--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
your
honor.
in
d.c.,
it
is
11
days.
in
many
other
jurisdictions
and
here,
there
is
no
set
time
limit.
and
one
of
the
problems
--
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
with
the
government's
rule
that
a
request
--
a
defense
request
for
additional
time
must
be
treated
differently
and
does
stop
the
clock,
is
that
gives
speedy
trial
consequences
to
those
variations
in
local
rules.
so,
in
districts
where
you
have
a
very
short
standard
timeframe,
the
defendant
has
to
run
in,
if
he
wants
to
file
pretrial
motions,
and
stop
the
clock
almost
automatically.
if
you
have
--
say,
your
motions
are
due
automatically
in
seven
days;
you
have
got
to
run
in
there
and
stop
the
clock.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
speedy
trial,
the
70
days,
it's
that
much
longer
in
those
districts
because
you
have
got
to
stop
the
clock
compared
to
districts
where,
say,
21
days
are
ordinarily
allotted.
well,
they
may
not
have
to
stop
the
clock.
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
illustrates
the
problem,
because
if
there
is
a
--
call
it
an
unreasonably
short
time
period
in
this
district,
the
speedy
trial
clock
only
burns
for
four
or
five
days
or
a
week,
and
then
someone
is
going
to
have
to
run
in
and
stop
it.
so
those
trials
are
just
going
to
take
longer.
let's
assume
that
it
takes
two
weeks
on
average
or
three
weeks
on
average
to
prepare
a
reasonable
pretrial
motion.
well,
in
those
jurisdictions
that
have
that
local
rule,
the
short
local
rule,
you
get
two
extra
weeks
on
the
speedy
trial
clock,
because
you
have
to
run
in
and
hit
stop
on
the
clock
by
asking
for
additional
time.
in
those
districts
that
give
you
21
days
by
default,
by
contrast,
that
whole
21
days
counts
against
the
70
days.
and
that
is,
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
an
essential
judgment
that
congress
made.
it
decided
on
70
days--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
if
you
assume
hypothetically
21
days
to
prepare--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--21
days
to
respond
and
call
it
21
days
to
rule--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--in
a
district
that
allows
21
days
of
preparation
time
by
default
rule,
21
days
will
burn
and
then
42
days
with
response
and
ruling.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
in
a
district
that
allows
only
five
days,
five
days
burn,
and
then
you
have
to
stop
the
clock
for
the
additional
16
days
of
preparation,
plus
21,
plus
21.
you
end
up
effectively,
if
the
difference
is
5
days
or
21
days,
there
is
an
86-day
speedy
trial
clock
in
the
district
with
the
short
rule
and
a
70-day
speedy
trial
clock
in
the
district
with
the
local
rule
--
with
the
21-day
rule.
and
so
i
think
it's
--
and
it's
clear
that
what
congress
did
not
want
in
the
speedy
trial
act
was
these
time
periods
to
be
amended
by
local
rule
effectively.
and
that's
what
would
happen.
i
think
more
fundamentally--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
in
subparagraph
(h),
3161(h)(1)(h)
allows
only
30
days
during
which
a
matter
is
actively
under
--
actually
under
advisement
by
the
district
court.
so
here
they
actual
did
set
a
30-day
clock
on
which
to
rule.
there
is
an
exception
to
that.
if
there
is
a
hearing
subparagraph
(d)
says,
well,
you
know,
we
are
not
going
to
govern
the
time
in
the
hearing,
and
this
court's
decision
in
henderson
gives
district
courts
flexibility
in
that
regard,
when
there
is
a
hearing.
but
congress
was
pretty
clear
in
trying
to
put
a
book
end
at
either
end.
it
starts
on
filing
and
it
ends
with
disposition,
and
we
only
give
you
30
days
without
a
hearing
or
after
the
hearing
to
dispose
of
it.
and
i
think
more
fundamentally
this
is
a
quintessentially
legislative
judgment.
congress
said,
this
is
a
system
of
rules
that
we
need
in
place
to
move
cases
more
expeditiously
toward
trial.
we
are
going
to
give
you
70
days.
we
are
going
to
exclude
certain
things
automatically,
and
we
are
going
to
give
district
courts
flexibility
under
(h)(7).
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
don't
--
that
sounds
a
lot
like
a
prospective
waiver
of
speedy
trial,
which
is
--
this
court
rejected
in
zedner.
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical
correctly,
if
the
district
court
says
if
i
give
you
extra
time,
we
are
not
going
to
complain
about
it
later.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
could
do
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
consistent--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think,
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical
correctly,
if
a
--
if
we
appear
before
the
district
judge
and
the
judge
says
exclusions
or
extensions
for
pretrial
motions
will
qualify
for
(h)(7),
that
sounds
like
to
me
in
an
individual
case
a
prospective
waiver
of
that
defendant's
speedy
trial
act--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor.
if
it's
done
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
where
the
time
is
requested
and
the
continuance
or
the
delay
is
granted
with
the
(h)(7)
findings
made
either
then
or
later,
that
would
be
perfectly
appropriate.
that's
how
congress--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no.
i'm
not
sure
i
--
i
apologize.
i'm
not
sure
i
under--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
--
that
time
is
not
excluded
if
it
is
just
set
by
local
rule.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes.
under
18
u.s.c.,
i
believe
it's
3288
and
3289,
essentially
gives
the
government
six
months
after
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
to
reindict
a
defendant.
and
courts
have
almost
universally
held
that
that
applies
--
or
i
believe
it's
universally
held
that
that
applies
where
the
dismissal
is
based
on
speedy
trial
act
grounds.
i
think
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
government
that
there
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations
problem.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the
speedy
trial
clock
starts
anew
after
a
new--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
clear
under
the
statute.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
don't
know.
my
supposition
is
that
it's
not
very
many.
the
government
certainly
hasn't
suggested
that
there
are
a
lot.
it
would
have
to
be
cases
within
those
eight
districts
or
--
pardon
me
--
i
guess
it
would
be
nine
or
ten,
that
have
either
not
taken
a
position
or
take
the
government's
position,
in
which
the
defendant
raised
this
argument
in
the
trial
court--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--in
a
timely
manner.
so
i
think
if
that
is
the
case,
it's
an
exceedingly
small
number,
and
for
that
matter,
that
would
be
a
problem
in
any
case
in
which
this
court
reverses
an
incorrect
ruling.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor,
but
nor
has
there
been
any
indication
that
district
courts
in
the
two
jurisdiction
where
they
get
the
rule
right
in
our
view
deny
defense
requests
for
additional
time.
i
think
--
i
think
this
rule
will
matter
if
you
assume
that
the
average
pretrial
motion
extension
is
relatively
modest
and
that
the
lawyers
are
fairly
reasonable
in
what
they
request.
we
are
talking
about,
you
know,
additional
delays
of
a
week
or
two
weeks,
but
that
is
--
again,
that
backs
right
up
into
the
congressional
judgment,
the
legislative
judgment
that
congress
made.
and
so
those
trials
will
on
average
in
the
majority
of
jurisdictions,
i
think,
just
take
that
much
longer
to
get
to
trial.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
that--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
that
would
be
--
that
is
the
most
important
function
of
(h)(7),
to
screen
out
the
truly
unmeritorious
delays.
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
get
at
most
of
all.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the
court
may--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--the
consequence
--
ruling
for
the
government
would
mean
that
any
time
a
defendant
needs
any
extra
time,
or
--
or
we
would
say
either
side
needs
any
extra
time,
the
clock
stops.
and
so
any
time
you
need
additional
time
for
pretrial
motions
there
is
no
balancing.
so
in
the
routine
case
that
is
not
complex,
where
the
--
where
the
defendant's
counsel
may
be
just
simply
not
exercising
due
diligence,
you
could
ask
for
two
weeks
and
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
balancing.
the
district
court
doesn't
even
have
to
ask,
what's
the
delay,
you
know,
why
the
extra
delay?
and
that
time
is
automatically
excluded.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
in
the
absence--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
am
sure
it
will
vary
from
court
to
court.
but
in
the
absence
of
(h)(7)
and
putting
it
on
the
record,
the
district
court
is
certainly
not
required
to
ask
and
may
not
--
certainly
won't
put
those
findings
on
the
record.
and
i
think
this
court
made
that
point
very
clear
in
zedner,
that
(h)(7)
balances
substantive
open-endedness
with
procedural
strictness,
and
the
procedure
is
what
matters,
and
congress
made
that
explicitly
clear
in
drafting
(h)(7).
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
would
like
to
quickly
address
what
i
hope
to
be
just
four
points.
the
first
is
the
government's
fundamental
principle.
the
fundamental
tenet
is
that
the
specific
treatment
of
pretrial
motions
in
subparagraph
(d)
suggests
no
negative
inference
or
limiting
inference
on
the
general
standard
of
(h)(1).
the
flaw
in
that
is
evident
by
looking
at
subparagraph
(h),
which
automatically
excludes
up
to
30
days
during
which
a
matter
is
under
advisement
by
the
district
court.
if
the
government's
reasoning
is
correct,
subparagraph
(h)
just
does
not
address
or
contains
--
or
suggests
no
negative
inference
on
whether
the
31st
day
of
a
matter
being
under
advisement
is
automatically
excludable
under
(h)(1).
that's
why
there
are
settled
canons
in
the
statutory
interpretation.
we
take
the
general
standard,
first
of
all,
is
it
a
proceeding?
there
is
no
pretrial
motion
proceeding
until
the
motion
is
filed.
second,
if
you
think
there
is
any
uncertainty
as
to
what
a
proceeding
is,
well,
look
at
how
the
enumerated
subparagraphs
that
follow,
what
do
they
describe.
one
specifically
addresses
pretrial
motions.
it
has
a
starting
point
and
it
has
an
end
point.
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
but
even
if
you
think
you
want
to
look
further.
well,
is
there
any
support
in
these
enumerated
subparagraphs
for
the
government's
rule
that
you
would
treat
a
defense
request
for
additional
time
differently?
no.
none
of
the
enumerated
subparagraphs
distinguishes
between
defense
requests
and
government
requests.
none
distinguishes
between
routinely
granted
time
or
specifically
alloted
time.
in
fact,
with
respect
to
defense
requests
specifically,
it
was
not
lost
on
congress
how
to
--
how
to
treat
government
counsel
and
defense
counsel
differently.
in
(h)(7)(c),
which
is
about
the
end
of
justice
exclusion,
it
specifies
that
the
government
cannot
get
an
end
of
justice
exclusion
based
on
its
inability
to
exercise
due
diligence
in
obtaining
a
witness
or
preparing.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
the
government's
rule
i
think
is--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--that's
not
their
position
in
their
brief,
your
honor.
they
say
the
defense
requests
for
additional
time--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--they
don't
say
anything
about
government
request.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
if
that's
their
position,
it's
more
unmoored
from
the
text
of
subparagraph
(d),
because
then
both
types
of
requests
--
so
subparagraph
--
pardon
me
--
so
(h)(1)'s
general
standard
is
expanded
even
farther--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
i
disagree
about
subparagraph
(d)
your
honor.
(d)
says
from
point
b
to--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--but
there
is
no--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--there
is
no
difference,
your
honor,
between
not
exceeding
30
days
and
from
and
to.
and
i
think
this
is
--
this
case
--
it
comes
to
that
and
that
alone,
which
is
congress
specifically
addressed
pretrial
motions,
any
delay
resulting
from
a
pretrial
motion
and
it
said
from
point
a
to
point
b.
and
even
if
you
had
to
look
behind
that,
you
would
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
senate
judiciary
committee
was
asked
a
specific
question
by
the
government
no
less,
can
we
include
preparation
time,
and
they
said
no.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
as
the
question
was
presented,
your
honor,
it
was
specific
to
preparation
time
and
the
period
--
and
the
period
from
--
i
don't
want
to
get
the
dates
wrong
but,
september
7th
to
october
4th.
but
i
would
add
that
the
government
didn't
raise
this
argument
below,
either.
nor
did
the
government
suggest,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
delay
that's
at
issue
here
results
from
the
grant
on
september
7th
of
additional
time.
rather
their
argument
as
i
have
understood
it
and
understood
it
when
reading
their
briefs
is
that
the
delay
--
the
ancillary
delay
stems
from
the
pretrial
motion,
the
time
allotted
for
pretrial
motions
itself.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
plead
ignorance
the
same.
