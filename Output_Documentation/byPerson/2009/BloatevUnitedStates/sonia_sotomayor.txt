justice
sonia
sotomayor
shouldn't
we
be
looking--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
at
the
time
that
(h)(1)(c)
--
or
(d)
was
being
looked
at,
wasn't
it
a
fact
that
some
circuits
had
reviewed
the
prior
exclusion
as
applying
only
to
the
date
in
which
there
were
actual
hearings
before
the
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
isn't
it
--
shouldn't
we
be
looking
at
what
you
did
with
respect
to
this
time
period
in
light
of
the
need
that
it
was
addressing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what's
wrong
with
the
logic
of
district
courts
who
have
ruled
in
this
--
in
the
government's
favor,
that
say
congress
was
only
looking
at
that
particular
part
of
the
proceeding
--
what
related
to
the
hearing,
the
filing
of
the
motion,
its
actual
adjudication
--
but
they
weren't
considering
a
motion
by
the
defendant
for
time
to
investigate,
and
that
can
be
another
proceeding?
can
you
imagine
a
situation
in
which
a
court
grants
that
adjournment
to
a
defense
attorney
where
we
would
reverse
that
finding
by
the
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
a
defense
attorney
comes
to
a
court
and
says,
i
need
an
adjournment,
and
the
court
says,
you
can
have
it,
isn't
that
implicitly
a
proceeding
in
which
the
court
is
saying
there
is
a
need
for
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
"proceeding"
doesn't
mean
an
act
--
it
is
an
act
before
the
court.
the
entire
action
is
before
the
court.
but
it
is
a
proceeding
in
which
the
defense
attorney
is
looking
at
whether
there's
anything
to
file
motions
about.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
senate
did.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wait
a
minute.
if
a
defense
attorney
comes
in
to
you
and
says
--
i'm
a
district
court
judge
--
i
need
time
to
prepare;
granted,
i
am
excluding
time
under
(7)(a).
you
are
saying
that
is
insufficient?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
not
okay
for
a
district
court
to
say,
you
tell
me
how
much
or
you
have
21
days
to
prepare
motions
and
i'm
excluding
time
because
of
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
local
rule
from
a
district
court
judge:
defendant
is
arraigned;
you
have
21
days
to
file
motions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
finish
answering
one
earlier
question.
you
said
that
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
problems
if
we
rule
in
your
favor.
could
you
explain
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
under
that
retrial
provision
the
court
begin
excluding
time?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
convictions
would
be
at
risk
for
reversal
under
this
rule,
that
would
be
currently
pending
and
subject
to
a
ruling
in
your
favor
now?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
a
timely
manner.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
you
disagree
with
your
adversary,
that
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
problem
if
we
rule
against
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
is
it
superfluous?
because
what
your
adversary
is
saying
is
that
congress
wanted
district
courts
to
think
about
why
some
things
were
being
--
additional
time
was
being
requested.
not
all
motions
by
defendants
would
a
district
court
actually
feel
were
warranted
and
might
say
to
that
individual
if
they
came
in:
look;
that
shouldn't
take
you
three
weeks;
that
should
only
take
you
a
week.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
doesn't
answer
my
point.
without
a
requirement
that
the
judge
actually
has
to
make
a
finding
in
the
interest
of
justice,
once
the
defense
attorney
comes
in
and
says,
i
want
a
month,
and
isn't
the
judge
required
to
give
him
the
month
because
it's
automatically
excludable?
what,
otherwise,
forces
the
judge
to
look
at
the
request
and
say,
"no;
is
it
really
in
the
interest
of
justice
for
me
to
give
you
that
month?
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
--
so
what
additional
requirements
are
we
imposing
on
the
judge
that
the
statute
itself
doesn't
command?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
judge
always
has
to
listen
to
the
reason,
weigh
it,
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
in
the
interest
of
justice
or
not,
how
much
more
burden
are
we
putting
on
a
judge
than
to
say,
look,
you
are
right,
you
need
a
month;
i
will
exclude
it
under
(7)(h).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
have
never
required
the
judge
to
give
a
litany
of
each
of
the
factors
under
(h)(7).
we
have
never
required
him
or
her
to
do
a
detailed
finding.
we've
just
required
them
to
say
there's
some
reason
for
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
zedner
seems
to
suggest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
a
normal
course
of
practice?
i've
never
quite
heard
of
other--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
then
the
court's
view
a
decision
or
statement
that
no
motions
are
going
to
be
filed
as
a
request
for
a
waiver
of
that
obligation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
intent
to
waive.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
didn't
see
it
as
a
motion.
it
didn't
move
to
waive.
it
said,
"i
waive".
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
idea
of
how
many,
if
we
rule
against
you,
until
we
--
speaking
hypothetically,
how
many
convictions
would
be
at
risk
for--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
it's
--
it's
not
everybody
who
invokes
a
speedy
trial
act
violation
objection.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
would
have
been
--
i
would
have
been
interested
in
knowing
the
effects
of
zedner.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
how
--
what
kind
of
burden
it
placed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
true
of
all
speedy
trial
act
actions
by
the
district
court.
they
always
run
the
risk
of
forgetting
to
make
a
finding.
that's
why
you
have
two
attorneys,
presumably--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
remind
them.
