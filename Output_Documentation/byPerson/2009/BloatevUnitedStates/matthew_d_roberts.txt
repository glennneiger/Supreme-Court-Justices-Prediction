mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
additional
time
granted
for
preparation
of
pretrial
motions
is
automatically
excluded
from
the
speedy
trial
act
deadline
for
commencing
trial.
for
three
reasons,
that
time
falls
under
section
3161(h)(1)
which
excludes
delay
resulting
from
other
proceedings
concerning
the
defendant.
first,
section
(h)(1)
excludes
delay
resulting
from
various
listed
proceedings
and
other
proceedings
that
are
analogous
or
ancillary
to
those
proceedings.
a
court's
grant
of
additional
motions
preparation
time
is
ancillary
to
pretrial
motions
themselves,
which
are
a
listed
proceeding.
it
facilitates
the
motions
because
adequate
time
to
prepare
them
is
critical
to
their
fair
and
accurate
resolution.
the
exclusion
is
similar
to
other
excludable
delays
that
result
from
proceedings
ancillary
to
listed
proceedings.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
the
time
from
september
7th
to
october
4th.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
delay
is
just
the
time
that's
being
used
for
preparation,
which
was
presumably
the
time
all
the
way
up
to
the
period
at
which
the
waiver
of
the
intent
to
file
motions
was
filed.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
think
the
act--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
that's
--
that's
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
act
doesn't
exclude
the
time
before
a
routine
deadline
for
filing
the
motion,
because
it
only
excludes
the
time
--
the
delay
resulting
from
an
individualized
proceeding.
but
it
makes
sense
not
to
exclude
the
--
the
time
before
the
routine
deadline
as
a
general
matter,
because
if
you
excluded
all
that
time,
then
you
--
the
result
would
be
that
the
basic
deadline
of
the
act
would
be
extended
and
time
would
be
excluded
in
cases
where
no
time
was
being
used
for
consideration
or
preparation
of
pretrial
motions.
but
once
you
know--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
time
running
from
the
order
of
the
district
court
granting
additional
time.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
there
were--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
request
--
the
request
for
time,
that
proceeding
was
done.
but
the
order
--
the
order
granting
additional
time
is
a
proceeding,
and
the
additional
time
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
order
--
an
order
is
a
step
in
the
case,
an
act
of
the
court--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--and
it's
a
proceeding.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
it's--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
but
it's
the
delay
resulting
from
the
order
that
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
courts
have
excluded
from
the
filing
of
a
motion
seeking
an
examination,
yes.
you
could
also,
that
would
probably
be
excluded
under
(h)(1)(d)--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
delay
resulting
from
the
examination
would
--
would
be
excluded
from
the
order
granting
the
examination
until
the
examination
was
complete.
and
then
there
would
be
a
determination
of
competence
or
incompetence.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
--
i
think
that
that's
--
that
that's
a
different
--
a
different
deferral,
your
honor.
it's
not
for
the
court's
consideration
of
a
plea
agreement
or
even
for
negotiations.
it's
saying
we're
going
to
take
time
out
so
that
the
defendant
can
demonstrate
his
--
his
good
conduct.
i
think
that
the
plea
agreement
provision
is
once
the
parties
have
proposed
an
agreement
to
the
court,
the
court
has
time
to
consider
whether
it
should
approve
that
and
that
time's
excluded.
and
in
fact
courts
have
excluded
the
time
that
the
parties
are
engaged
in
plea
negotiations
as
ancillary
to
that
provision
of
consideration
of
the
proposed
plea
agreement.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm
not
sure.
if
you
think
that
the
--
that
there's
delay
that
results
from
the
grant
of
the
extension,
i
don't
think
that
the
petitioners
ever
challenged
the
length
of
the
delay
that
was
excluded,
so
the
only
issue
that's
before
the
court
is
whether
that
delay
is
excluded.
i
don't
know
that
the
petitioners
preserved
any
argument
about
the
length
of
the
delay,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm
not
sure
that
we
lose.
i
have
to
confess
that
i
haven't
calculated
the
--
the
exact
amount
of
time
that
--
that
results.
in
any
case,
there
are
other
periods
of
delays--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yeah.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
right.
i
guess
i
would
say,
if
there
was
some
question
about
the
length
of
delay,
the
appropriate
thing
would
be
to
--
to
rule
for
us
on
the
issue
that's
before
the
court,
remand
to
the
courts
below,
allow
them
to
decide
whether
the
petitioners
preserved
the
question
about
the
length
of
delay
and
what
the
effect
is
on
a
rule
that
would
only
limit
the
additional
delay.
you
know,
we
also
have
other
arguments
for
the
fact
that
we
think
that,
even
if
this
time
isn't
excluded,
that,
based
on
--
based
on
the
additional
preparation
time,
that
there's
still
no
speedy
trial
act
here,
that
we
raised
in
the
--
in
the
brief
of
--
in
opposition,
and
we
would
think
that
that
should
be
taken
into
account
on
any
remand
like
that
as
well.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
because
the
--
on
september
25th,
petitioner
filed
a
notice
of
intent
to
waive
pretrial
motions,
and
then
there
was
a
hearing
on
that
on
the
4th,
and
so
that
filing
would
be
analogous
to
a
motion
or
a
motion
that
would
trigger
it's
own
delay,
that
it
would
trigger
it's
own
exclusion
of
time
even
if
the
time
starting
on
september
7th
was
not
excluded.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
--
the
court
had
originally
said
--
the
court
had
originally
provided
in
its
order
that
on
the
deadline
for
filing
motions
the
--
the
petitioner
should
either
file
the
motions
or
indicate
whether
he
wanted
to
waive
the
motions
and
then
set
a
hearing
on
either
one,
on
the
4th,
and
that's
what
happened.
after
he
filed
that
paper
on
the
4th,
the
court
held
a
hearing,
and
the
defendant
--
discussed
with
the
defendant
personally
whether
he
wanted
to
waive
his
right
to
file
motions.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
the
defendant
waived
his
right
to
file
motions,
which
had
a
consequence,
you
know,
in
the
case.
the
second
reason
that
the
additional
time
granted
for
preparation
of
pretrial
motions
is
automatically
excluded
is
that
the
exclusion
in
section
(h)(1)(d)
for
delay
resulting
from
pretrial
motions
themselves
excludes
the
time
that
a
court
grants
the
non-moving
party
to
prepare
a
response.
and,
as
justice
ginsburg,
in
her
questions
suggested,
it
would
make
little
sense
automatically
to
exclude
time
granted
to
respond
to
motions,
but
not
the
time
granted
for
the
specific
purpose
of
preparing
them.
in
fact,
this
court
employed
similar
reasoning
to
that
in
the
henderson
case
when
it
held
that
the
act
excludes
the
time
after
a
court
has
held
a
hearing
on
a
motion
while
the
court's
awaiting
further
written
submissions.
the
court
reasoned
that
it
would
make
no
sense
not
to
exclude
that
time
because
the
act
excludes
all
the
time
before
the
hearing,
as
well
as
30
days
after
a
motion's
taken
under
advisement;
and
likewise
it
would
make
no
sense
not
to
exclude
time
that
is
specifically
granted
to
prepare
motions
when
the
court
excludes
the
time
granted
to
respond
to
them.
third--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
section
--
section
(h)(1),
your
honor,
expressly
states
that
it
excludes
delays,
including,
but
not
limited,
to
the
listed
delays,
so
no
negative
inference
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
listed
examples
don't
specifically
address
delays
resulting
from
the
grant
of
additional
motions
preparation
time.
section
(h)(1)(d)
is
addressing
a
related,
but
different
delay,
the
delay
from
the
pretrial
motion
itself.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
because
congress
specifically
amended
it
in
1979,
in
response
to
previous
interpretations
by
some
courts
that
had
excluded
only
the
time
that
was
spent
in
actual
court
hearings,
and
the
language
makes
clear
that
all
the
time
from
the
filing
of
the
motion
through
the
hearings,
including
the
--
not
just
the
court
hearing
time
--
is
excluded,
and
it
--
the
language
continues
to
--
to
make
that
clear,
even
if
preparation
time
is
also
sometimes
excluded.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
i
don't
think
that
there
are
statute
of
limitations
problems,
your
honor,
but
requiring
judges
to
make
superfluous
ends
of
justice
findings--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
a
court
should
always
be
doing
that
in
considering
whether
to
grant
additional
time
that's
requested,
your
honor.
neither
the
defendant
nor
the
public
is
going
to
have
an
interest
in
rushing
to
trial
without
adequate
time
to
prepare--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
--
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
give
him
the
additional
time.
presumably,
the
judge
should
only
give
him
the
--
the
additional
time
if
more
time
is
needed
to
prepare
the
--
the
motions,
based
on
the
justification
that
the
defendant--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
what--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
judge
has
to
specifically
consider
all
of
the
specified
factors
that
are
in
(b)(1)
through
(4)--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
the
court
--
the
statute
says
that
the
judge
shall
consider
the
specific
factors,
and
some
courts
at
least
have
--
have
reversed
--
if
a
--
situations
where
the
court
hasn't
considered
the
factors.
in
addition,
there
have
to
be
specific
ends
of
justice
findings,
which
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
counsel
on
the
other
side:
the
findings
have
to
be
made
before
the
continuance
is
granted.
what--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--what
zedner
says
is
the
findings
have
to
be
made
before
the
continuance
is
granted.
they
can
be
recorded
later,
but
they
have
to
be
made,
because
otherwise
the
continuance
isn't
made
on
the
basis
of
the
findings.
so
if
the
judge
didn't
go
through,
consider
the
factors,
and
make
the
findings,
if
only
in
the
judge's
mind,
then
the
judge
shouldn't
be
recording
them
later
on.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
is
recorded.
i
guess
--
i
guess
not,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
act
just
doesn't
operate
so
that
--
so
that
all
the
districts'
excludable
delays
are
even
across
districts.
the
exclusion
in
section
(h)(1)(d),
the
exclusion
for
pretrial
motions,
excludes
the
time
that's
allotted
to
prepare
responses.
and
there
is
wide
variation
among
the
different
districts
in
the
time
that's
allotted
to
prepare
responses.
so,
for
example,
the
northern
district
of
florida
gives
14
days
after
the
motion.
the
northern
district
of
illinois
gives
ten
days
after
the
motion.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
for
response
time.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
going
to
be
different.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
so
it's
the
same
--
it's
the
same
issue.
they're
just
--
it
isn't
in
lockstep.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
this
is
specifically
authorized
by
congress,
too,
because
section
(h)(1)
is
--
is
a
general
exclusion
for
delay
resulting
from
proceedings
concerning
the
defendant.
and,
you
know,
these
are
--
the
list
of
things
are
examples
only.
and
this
covers
those
proceedings
and
other
proceedings,
including
those
that
like
this
one
that
are
ancillary
to
the
listed
ones.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
it
depends
on
the
particular
case
and
what
motions
are
in
--
or
what
motions
are
involved,
your
honor.
but
the
--
the
rule
is
going
to
operate
differentially,
too.
under
petitioner's
theory,
people
come
in
asking
for
different
extensions
of
time
to
get
(h)(7)
continuances,
which
petitioner
says
are
not
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
get
granted.
so
i
think,
both
in
terms
of
the
response
time
varying
and
in
terms
of
the
rule
having
the
same
effect,
whether
it's
excluded
under
(h)(1)
or
(h)(7),
i'm
not
sure
that
you
are
going
to
ever
get
a
complete
parity.
that's
really
not
what
congress
was
intending.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
the
way
the
courts
have
interpreted
it,
because
once
the
--
once
the
determination
has
been
made
that
there
should
be
time
to
prepare
a
response,
then
you
know
that
you're
outside
of
the
case
where
you
don't
know
whether
any
of
this
time
in
the
routine
deadline
is
being
used
for
response
--
for
consideration
of
motions
or
preparation
of
motions.
you
know
that
counsel
is
using
time
for
that
purpose.
but
i
would
say,
you
know,
the
same
answer
back
to
you,
that
--
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
additional
time
should
--
is
excluded
when
it's
granted.
the
issue
isn't
how
much
time
should
have
been
excluded.
and
if
--
if
the
court
thinks
that
an
incorrect
amount
of
time
has
been
--
was
calculated
as
excluded,
i
think
that
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
in
that
circumstance
would
be
for
the
court
to
leave
that
open
on
remand,
assuming
that
it's
--
that
it's
preserved.
but,
you
know,
i
think
that
--
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
right,
your
honor.
i
--
petitioner
never
argued,
at
least
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
that
the
error
was
a
miscalculation
of
the
amount
of
time,
rather
than
the
exclusion
of
the
time
under
the
wrong
statutory
provision.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
on
the
25th.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
as
i
was
saying
before,
what
--
he
did
make
a
filing
on
the
25th,
and
the
court
took
action
in
response
to
that
filing
on
the
4th,
by
holding
a
hearing
at
which
he
waived
the
motions
as
he
indicated
that
he
was
doing
on
the
--
on
the
25th.
so--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor,
he
made
a
filing
and
then
the
court
--
the
court
held
a
hearing
in
response
to
that,
and
actually
engaged
in
a
colloquy
with
the
defendant,
asked
the
--
asked
the
defendant,
"do
you
understand
what
you
are
giving
up?
"
"do
you
want
to
waive
these
motions?
"
he
said,
"yes,
i
want
to
do
that.
"
and
the
court
ruled,
then,
on
that
on
the
4th.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
it's
a
general
practice,
your
honor.
it
does
seem
to
be
typical
in
this
--
in
this
district,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
it
was
in
fact
a
waiver
notice,
a
notice
of
intent
to
waive,
that
the
defendant
filed.
not
just--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
mean,
it
was
framed
as
a
waiver,
a
waiver
of
pretrial
motions.
it's
docket
entry
21.
but
i
don't
think
it's
--
you
know,
it's
in
the
record,
but
not
in
the
--
in
the
ja.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
--
that's
true,
but
the
court
didn't
--
the
court
held
the
hearing
on
the
4th.
and
it
engaged
in
this
conversation
with
the
defendant
and
then
made
a
decision
on
the
4th
that
the
time
was
waived,
that
the
--
the
waiver,
not--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--not
at
the
time
it
was
filed.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
that
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
comes
under
--
it
probably
comes
under
(h)(1),
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
mean,
it
could
come
under
(d),
your
honor.
it
could
come
under
(h)(1).
i
would
say
it
really
comes
under
both
--
best
fits
under
(h)(1)
as
analogous
to
a
motion
that's
not
exactly
a
motion.
but,
you
know,
either
way,
the
point
is
that
it
was
something
that
the
court
required
the
court
action,
or
at
least
as
the
court
had
set
the
rules
in
this
proceeding
required
court
action,
and
then
it
did
ultimately
did
have
court
action
on
the
4th.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
just
under
--
i
would
say,
your
honor,
just
under
the
general
language
of
(h)(1),
because
it's
not
strictly
a
pretrial
motion,
but
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
pretrial
motion.
but
you
could
say
that
it
falls
under
--
under
(h)(1)(d),
and
think
of
it
as
a
motion
itself.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
couldn't
say
precisely,
your
honor,
but
it
is
the
rule
that's
been
followed
in
eight
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
that's
true.
i
mean,
i
can't
say
that
they
are
going
to
be
--
and
i
would
have
to
agree
with
--
with
petitioner's
counsel
that,
you
know,
that
there
are
consequences
in
whatever
ruling
that
the
court
--
that
the
court
makes
in
a
case.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yeah.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
any
precise
--
precise
information
on
that.
but
i
think
that,
you
know,
even
apart
from
the
transitional
effects
that
there
are
going
to
be
on
a
going-forward
basis,
sometimes
judges
are
going
--
would
--
would
grant
additional
preparation
time
and
neglect
to
make
the
required
finding.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
right--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--and
that
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
if
findings
under
(h)(7)
were
necessary.
but
section
(h)(1)
is
designed
to
address
frequently
recurring
situations
in
which
the
ends
of
justice
are
virtually
always
going
to
be
served
by
delaying
the
trial
for
the
purpose.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
we
--
we
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
that's
why
petitioner
is
wrong
in
saying
that
(d)
addresses
the
delay
we
are
talking
about
here
and
precludes
its
recognition
under
--
under
(h)(1).
the
delay
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
resulting
from
the
pretrial
motion,
it's
resulting
from
the
grant
of
--
the
order
granting
additional
time
to
prepare
for
the
motion.
and
that,
that
is
the
related
but
different
proceeding
and
a
different
kind
of
delay
related
to
motions
practice.
so
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
the
order
granting
the
additional
time
of
the
proceeding--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--and
if
the
delay
results
from
that
order
and
the
order
is
ancillary
to
a
listed
proceeding,
which
is
the
pretrial
motions
because
it
facilitates
that
proceeding,
because
it
provides
for
adequate
preparation,
which
enabled
the
motions
to
be
resolved
favorably
and
accurately.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
(h)(1),
the
general
provision,
which
courts
have
used
to
exclude
numerous--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
it's
a
--
another
proceeding
that
--
that
is
covered
by
the
including
but
not
limited
to
language
on--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--(h)(1).
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
think
(h)(1)
says
any
period
of
delay
resulting
from
other
proceedings
concerning
the
defendant.
that
could
be
a
period,
and
it
covers
a
whole
range
of
proceedings
that
generate
delay.
and
then--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--then
there
is
a
list
of
examples.
and
the
examples
are
intended
only
to
be
illustrative.
and
what's
--
what's
covered
is
in
addition
to
those
examples,
other
proceedings
that
are
analogous
or
ancillary
to
them.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
is
the
proceedings
beforehand,
your
honor.
yes.
but
the
--
that's
not
the
--
you
know,
first
of
all,
as
i
said,
a
proceeding
is
a
--
is
an
act
done
by
the
court
or
under
the
court's
authority,
so
in
order
to
fit
squarely
within
that.
plus
i
would
direct
you
to
(h)(1)(f),
which
indicates
that
orders
can
be
proceedings
here
because
it
excludes
delay
following
an
order
of
removal
or
an
order
directing
the
transportation
of
the
defendant.
and,
so,
i
think
that
there's
indication
in
the
examples
themselves
when
orders
are
sometimes
proceedings.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
--
there
--
there
would
be
an
order,
so
there
would
be
a
proceeding.
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
proceeding
that
would
be
covered
under
(h)(1)
because
it
--
to
be
covered
it
has
to
be
a
proceeding
of
the
type
that
is
listed
here.
it
has
to
be
analogous
to
these
proceedings
or
ancillary
to
them,
facilitating
these
proceedings
in
some
way,
your
honor.
