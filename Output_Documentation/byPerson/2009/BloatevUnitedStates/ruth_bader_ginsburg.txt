justice
ruth
bader

that
would
allow
the
prosecutor's
time
to
be
excluded,
right?
on
your
theory
that
it
starts
--
the
trigger
is
the
filing
of
the
motion,
and
it
ends
when
the
motion
is
disposed
of.
so
the
prosecutor
might
say,
i
need
additional
time,
and
that
would
be
included
in
the
suspension
period,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
clock
--
the
clock
would
run,
on
your
theory,
during
the
preparation
time
of
the
defendant.
it
would
not
run
during
the
preparation
time
of
the
prosecutor.
so
i
don't
think
they
are
being
treated
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
prosecutor's
answer
to
the
defense
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
point
that
i
would
like
you
to
clarify.
i
--
i
understand
you
to
take
the
position
that
the
interest
of
justice
would
be
the
route
to
take,
where
the
judge
would
have
to
stop
and
make
a
finding.
in
your
view,
would
it
be
appropriate,
assuming
your
interpretation
of
(b)(i)
holds,
for
us
to
send
the
case
back,
or
is
it
too
late,
because
the
interest
of
justice
finding
was
never
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
think
it
could
be
found.
if
it
doesn't
have
to
be
found
on
the
spot
by
the
judge,
when
is
the
latest
time
the
judge
could
make
the
interest
of
justice
filing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
result
in
your
case
would
be
that
the
case
is
dismissed,
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
certainly
encourage
judges
who
don't
want
to
get
involved
with
making
findings,
which
you
have
to
do
to
satisfy
interest
of
justice,
to
just
say:
motion
denied;
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
have
the
clock
run
while
you
--
you
are
asking
me
for
a
favor.
you
want
time
to
prepare,
and
the
clock
is
going
to
run
in
the
meantime.
forget
it.
you
are
not
going
to
get
the
extension.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
must
the
judge
--
the
judge
must
make
a
finding
orally
or
in
writing.
can
it
just
say,
okay,
i'm
giving
it
to
you
in
the
interest
of
justice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
--
is
there
any
indication
in
the
circuits
that
follow
what
seems
to
be
the
majority
rule
--
that
is
that
the
clock
is
stopped
during
preparation
time
--
that
there
have
been
excessive
delays,
in
comparison
to
the
--
what
is
it,
two
circuits
who
go
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
--
what
was
the
second
point
you
just
made,
mr.
roberts?
that,
even
if
the
clock
is
running,
you
would
still
have
an
argument
that
you
come
within
the
70
days
because?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
would
argue
it
wasn't
reserved
because
both
sides
thought
the
period
was
from
september
7th
until
october
4th,
and
one
thought
that
that
whole
period
should
be
excluded?
that
was
your
position,
and
then
the
other
side
said
none
of
it--
