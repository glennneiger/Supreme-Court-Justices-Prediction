chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-728,
bloate
v.
united
states.
mr.
stancil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
a
district
judge,
as
part
of
his
normal
pretrial
order,
say
that
i
am
inclined
to
grant
normal
motions
for
extensions,
but
i
think
so
we
don't
run
into
these
problems
that
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
justice
that
whatever
time
i
grant,
i
issue
an
order
covered
by
(h)(7)(a)?
that
avoids
all
this
problem.
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
speedy
trial
act
when
i
grant
you
a
motion,
because
whatever
i
grant
you
is
going
to
be
excluded
under
(h)(7)(a).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
presumably,
a
judge
can
do
it
in
every
case.
you
are
saying
they
can't
tell
you
in
advance
this
is
what
they
are
going
to
do,
but
they
can
do
it
automatically
in
every
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
ask
a
specific
date
question?
am
i
right
that
you
would
exclude
the
time
from
september
7th
to
october
4th?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
makes
much
sense.
before
the
motion
for
extension
was
filed,
the
hearing
date
for
pretrial
motions
was
september
20.
after
the
extension
was
filed
and
granted,
the
hearing
date
was
october
4th.
so
the
only
period
of
delay
that
you
could
say
resulted
from
the
extension
was
from
september
20
to
october
4,
or
13
days.
well,
how
can
you
possibly
count
the
time
as
a
delay
after
he
filed
his
extension
up
to
the
point
when
things
would
have
been
due
anyway?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
how
is
that
a
--
how
is
the
time
being
spent
for
preparation
a
delay,
when
some
of
that
time
was
going
to
be
allowed
anyway?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
motions
were
not
due
until
september
25th.
so
i
don't
see
how
the
time
he
spent
before
then
can
be
regarded
as
a
delay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
proceeding
from
which
you
count
in
determining
what
should
be
excluded?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
that
order
--
that
proceeding
was
initiated
and
ruled
on
the
same
day.
the
person
comes
in
and
says:
i
would
like
time.
the
judge
that
same
day
says
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
proceeding
takes
a
day.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
additional
time
flowing
from
the
order
is
a
proceeding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
one
day.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ah.
now
that
--
now
--
now
i
don't
see
how
that's
consistent
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
act.
if
you
take
(h)(1)(a),
that
excludes
delay
resulting
from
any
proceeding
to
determine
mental
competency.
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
under
your
theory
that
would
include
the
time
from
the
filing
of
that
motion
to
the
end
of
the
determination
of
mental
competency,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ah.
well
--
yes.
well,
or
--
yes
--
no,
i'm
looking
at
(h)(4).
now
(h)(4)
excludes
any
period
of
delay
resulting
from
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
--
is
mentally
incompetent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
redundant
if
you
exclude
the
delay
from
the
examination
and
then
also
exclude
mental
incompetence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
well,
let's
look
at
(h)(1)(g).
that
excludes
delay
resulting
from
consideration
by
the
court
of
a
proposed
plea
agreement.
but
then
(h)(2)
says
any
period
of
delay
in
which
prosecution
is
deferred
pursuant
to
a
written
--
written
agreement
with
the
defendant,
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
defendant
to
demonstrate
his
good
conduct,
which
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
a
plea
agreement
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
disagree
with
you
that,
when
the
time
that
is
extended
before
a
hearing
on
the
pretrial
motions
and
the
acceptance
of
a
waiver,
which
runs
from
13
days,
september
20,
the
original
date,
and
the
date
that
it
actually
took
place,
which
is
13
days,
and
if
i
think,
contrary
to
your
submission,
which
is
that
the
whole
time
from
the
filing
of
the
extension
to
the
final
hearing
is
delay,
even
though
it
was
only
13
days
that
was
pushed
back,
then
you
lose,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
putting
aside
what
petitioners
may
or
may
not
have
argued,
if
i
think
that
the
delay
is
only
how
far
the
date
for
consideration
of
a
motion
and
acting
on
the
motion
has
been
moved
--
in
this
case,
from
september
20
to
october
4;
in
other
words,
it's
13
days,
not
28
days
--
then
you
lose,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
it
would
be,
take
15
days
from
what
time
you
have
calculated,
and
that's
--
that's
under
the
wire
--
or
is
it
above
the
wire?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
i
am
contesting
15
of
your
days,
and
you
figured
out
how
much
days
you
think
can
be
excluded
or
not
excluded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
this
may
be
the
same
question
i
was
asking
earlier,
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i've
got
your
answer.
let's
say
the
original
date
for
filing
motions
is,
as
it
was
here,
september
13th,
right?
on
september
7th,
mr.
bloate
asks
for
additional
time.
so
the
judge's,
you
know,
runs
a
tight
ship,
and
he
says,
i
will
give
you
one
day.
one
more
day,
so
now
it's
due
on
september
14th.
you
would
say
the
delay
resulting
from
that
extension
was
seven
days,
from
september
7th,
when
he
filed
it,
to
september
14th,
and
not
one
day.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
delay
--
so
saying
i'm
not
going
to
file
any
pretrial
motions
results
in
a
delay
from
a
pretrial
motion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stancil,
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
is
your
friend
correct
that
the
issue
of
the
proper
calculation
is
not
before
us?
so
that
the
time
i
spent
figuring
that
out
should
be
excluded
from
something?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
whether
or
not
you
think
that
type
of
delay
is
excludable
depends
on
what
that
type
of
delay
is,
which
requires
some
sense
of
how
it's
going
to
be
calculated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
this
case
is
submitted.
but
before
we
rise
for
--
the
afternoon,
i
would
like
to
note
that
we're
very
pleased
to
have
visiting
with
us
today
is
president
augusto
ibanez
and
other
members
of
the
columbian
supreme
court,
welcome,
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
number
08-728,
bloate
versus
united
states.
he
has
asked
that
i
read
his
announcement.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
on
august
24,
2007
for
federal
firearm
and
drug
crimes.
his
trial
was
delayed
by
various
events,
including
his
request
for
additional
pretrial
motion
preparation
time.
the
trial
eventually
began
on
march
5,
2008,
179
days
after
petitioner's
indictment.
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
pretrial
delay
exceeded
the
70-day
limit
set
forth
in
the
speedy
trial
act.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
after
determining
that
the
act
itself
excluded
most
of
the
delays
from
the
70-day
deadline.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed.
it's
relevant
to
our
decision
today
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
additional
time
granted
to
petitioner
for
pretrial
motion
preparation
should
be
automatically
excluded
under
section
3161
h1,
which
directs
a
district
court
not
to
count
?delay
resulting
from
proceedings
concerning
the
defendant."
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
pretrial
motion
preparation
time
should
be
considered
not
under
the
general
language
of
section
3161
h1,
but
under
the
more
specific
language
of
3161
h1-d,
which
addresses
delay
resulting
from
any
pretrial
motion
and
thus
governs
the
pretrial
motion
related
delay
at
issue
in
this
case.
because
sub
paragraph
d
provides
for
the
automatic
exclusion
only
of
delay
from
the
filing
of
the
motion
through
its
conclusion
or
disposition,"
preparation
time
which
precedes
the
beginning
of
the
automatically
excludable
period
is
not
automatically
excludable.
this
reading
of
the
statute
respects
congress'
decision,
that
the
benefits
of
pretrial
motion
related
delay
always
outweigh
the
parties
and
public's
interest
in
a
speedy
trial
only
after
the
filing
of
the
motion.
it
also
respects
the
fact
that
congress
did
authorize
the
exclusion
of
pretrial
motion
related
delay
falling
outside
the
parameters
of
sub
paragraph
d,
but
only
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
subsection
h7
expressly
permits
a
district
court
to
grant
a
continuance
in
order
to
give
the
defendant
adequate
and
effective
preparation
time.
the
delay
caused
by
such
a
continuance
may
be
excluded
based
only
on
specific
written
findings
by
the
court.
subsection
h7
thus
provides
district
courts
ample
means
to
permit
the
pretrial
motion
related
delay
necessary
to
fair
proceedings
without
risking
dismissal
under
the
act.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
