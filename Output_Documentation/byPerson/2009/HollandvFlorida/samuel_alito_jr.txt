justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
facts
here
--
the
facts
here
are
quite
extreme,
but
i
am
troubled
by
where
you
think
the
line
should
be
drawn.
if
it
is
just
mere
negligence,
would
that
be
enough
for
equitable
tolling?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well
--
the
difference
between
mere
negligence
and
gross
negligence
--
one
of
the
things
i
remember
most
clearly
from
torts
in
law
school
is
that
that's
pretty
--
that's
an
ephemeral
distinction.
but
that's
the
one
you
one
you
think
we
should
draw,
between
mere
--
if
it's
gross
negligence,
then
there's
equitable
tolling;
if
it's
mere
negligence,
it's
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
just
tell
me
in
a
sentence
or
two
what
test
you
think
we
should
apply
for
equitable
tolling?
what
is
necessary
in
order
for
there
to
be
equitable
tolling?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does
"extraordinary
circumstances"
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
lawyer
lies
to
the
client
and
the
client
says
my
time
is
running
out,
have
you
filed
my
--
my
federal
habeas
petition,
and
the
lawyer
says,
yes,
i
filed
it
and
here
it
is,
and
it
has
a
--
a
forged
date
stamp
on
it?
no
equitable
tolling
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
there
at
least
one
additional
thing
here?
holland
filed
a
request
--
a
pro
se
request
to
be
relieved
of
collins's
representation,
and
that
was
rejected
by
the
--
that
was
rejected
by
the
court
because
he
was
pro
se.
and
therefore
he
couldn't
ask
--
he
couldn't
file
something
himself?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
that
denied
on
the
ground
that
he
was
pro
se?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
i
don't
understand
is,
how
can
a
--
how
can
a
client
request
to
have
--
to
be
relieved
of
representation,
if
the
client
can't
file
that
motion
pro
se?
i
understand
the
other
things,
but
i
don't
understand
why
--
how
--
how
you
can
deny
the
request
to
get
rid
of
this
lawyer?
unless
he
has
to
have
the
lawyer
file
the
motion
for
him?
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
were
the
lies?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
--
give
me
an
example
of
a
lie
that
he
told
him?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
that
go
without
saying,
that
every
attorney
--
and
every
attorney
presumably
undertakes
not
to
miss
the
statute
of
limitations?
is
there
a
difference
between
the
attorney
who
simply
says
nothing
and
the
attorney
who
says,
yes,
i'm
not
going
to
miss
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
a
lie?
