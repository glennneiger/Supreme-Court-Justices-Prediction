justice

well,
that
--
but
that's
the
case
in
every
case
where
--
where
the
lawyer
is
negligent
and
doesn't
do
something
that
--
that
should
have
been
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
assured
the
client,
i
will
take
care
of
your
case,
and
he
doesn't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
that
happened
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
never
held
that
equitable
tolling
for
anything
is
available
under
this
statute
of
limitations
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
should
it
be?
it
seems
to
me,
this
is
not
like
the
ordinary
statute
of
limitations,
where
it
says,
you
know,
the
statute
is
five
years,
and
courts
make
all
sorts
of
necessary
exceptions
to
the
five
years.
but
here
you
have
a
statute
that
--
that
provides
exceptions,
for
example,
"the
limitation
period
shall
run
from
the
latest
of
the
date
on
which
the
impediment
to
filing
an
application
created
by
state
action
in
violation.
"
"is
removed.
"
in
other
words,
we're
going
to
toll
it
for
that
particular
event.
"the
date
on
which
the
constitutional
right
asserted
was
initially
recognized
by
the
supreme
court.
"
--we're
going
to
toll
it
for
that.
"the
date
on
which
the
factual
predicate
of
the
claim
or
claims
presented
could
have
been
discovered
through
exercise
of
due
diligence.
"
many
of
--
many
of
the
equitable
tolling
holdings
involved
precisely
that.
we'll
toll
it
since
you
couldn't
have
found
out
about
the
violation
within
the
statutory
period.
but
all
of
these
things
are
handled
already
in
2244(d).
why
should
we
--
why
should
we
assume
the
right
to
create
some
additional
exceptions
from
the
--
from
the
1-year
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
a
case
this
afternoon
involving
an
opinion
of
ours
named
mcnally,
which
held
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
fraud
action
for
a
right
to
honest
services.
how
many
of
the
courts
of
appeals
had
held
that
there
did
exist
such
a
right
when
we
held
that
there
didn't
in
mcnally?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
single
court
of
appeals
that
had
faced
it
had
held
that
there
was
such
a
right.
so
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
11
court
of
appeals
that
have
found
that
they
have
extraordinary
power
--
judges
like
to
find
that
they
have
power
--
and
that
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then
it's
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
what
caused
--
what
caused
the
inability
to
--
to
bring
the
habeas
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
that
is
--
is
preliminary
to
that.
this
may
have
been
a
very
irresponsible
lawyer,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
event
that
--
the
simple
event,
failure
to
file
in
that
what,
30-day
period,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--fourteen
days.
it
seems
to
me
"extraordinary"
means
unusual.
so
you
say
any
unusual
event
is
a
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
unusual
event
is
a
possible
for
a
court
to
say,
oh,
yes,
it
says
a
year,
but
this
is
unusual
so
we
will
give
you
a
year
and
a
half.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
had
a
lot
of
time
to
devote
to
it.
