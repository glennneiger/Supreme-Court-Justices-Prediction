mr.
todd
g.
scher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
undisputed
that
petitioner
was
not
provided
notice
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
denied
his
postconviction
appeal
and
had
issued
its
mandate,
with
the
result
being
that
his
aedpa
statute
of
limitations
expired.
the
very
day
he
learned
this,
petitioner
immediately
prepared
a
pro
se
habeas
petition
and
filed
it
within
24
hours.
before
this,
petitioner
had
taken--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
first
of
all,
we
have
what
the
eleventh
circuit
characterized
mr.
collins's
conduct
as,
which
was
gross
negligence.
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
confluence--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--we
have
a
repeated
pattern.
for
example,
first
of
all
we
have
to
go
back
in
terms
of
what
happened
in
state
court.
first
we
have
mr.
collins's
assurances
to
mr.
holland
that
he
would
in
fact
file
his
federal
--
or
was
aware
of
this--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
correct.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
well
--
well,
in
terms
of
that
what
we
have
here,
for
example,
is
mr.
collins
was
given
two
opportunities
--
or
the
record
shows
that
there
were
two
opportunities
for
mr.
collins
to
provide
answers
to
these
very
questions.
the
most
significant
of
those
responses
was
--
was
in
the
federal
district
court
where
the
federal
district
judge
in
fact
issued
a
show
cause
order
to
mr.
collins
asking
him
to
respond
specifically
to
mr.
holland's
allegations.
and
in
that
response
mr.
collins
completely
ignored
all
of
mr.
holland's
allegations.
he
never
denied
that
--
being
instructed
to
file
the
petition.
he
never
denied
that
he
had
in
fact
informed
mr.
holland
that
he
wouldn't
--
that
he
would
file
the
petition.
he
never
denied
any
of
the
allegations
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
mr.
holland
wanted
that
federal
habeas
petition
filed
on
time.
he
just
went
on
to
address--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
here
we
have--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--this
--
this
goes
beyond
the
case
of
mere,
garden-variety
negligence
that
some
of
the
courts
have
--
have
addressed,
because
here
we
have
a
combination
of
not
only
a
failure
--
we
have
the
failure
to
notify
mr.
holland
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
in
fact
denied
its
opinion,
despite
repeated
instructions
from
holland
to
mr.
collins
that
he
file
his
petition.
mr.
holland
wrote--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--no,
courts
--
and
this
court
in
lawrence
has
held,
for
example,
that
mere
negligence
is
not
sufficient.
what
we
have
here
certainly
is
suggestive--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
we
know
certainly
that
the
floor
from
--
from
cases
from
this
court
and
from
other
courts
is
this
mere
or
garden-variety
negligence.
but
when
you
get
to
other
factors--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
this
court--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--this
and
other
courts
have
--
have
been
able
to
draw
that
line,
and,
of
course
you
have
to
look
at
the
specifics
of
each
particular
case,
because
not
only--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
the
way--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
in
some
circumstances,
courts
have
just
said,
unfortunately
you
lose,
your
attorney
didn't
commit
--
it
was
just
a
mere
mistake.
but
what
we
have
here,
of
course,
is
not
--
we
don't
have
a
mere
mistake;
we
have
a
confluence
of
these
particular
factors.
and
i
think
one
of
the
more
salient
points
that
distinguishes
mr.
holland's
case,
for
example,
from
lawrence
and
from
the
situation
in
coleman,
is
that
mr.
holland
tried
to
rid
himself
of
mr.
collins
on
numerous
occasions
while
this
case
was
in
state
court.
in
lawrence
and
in
coleman,
the
petitioners
were
not
allowed
to
be
free
of
their
lawyers;
they
accepted
those
lawyers'
representation
--
they
accepted
their
representation
and
the
acts
and
omissions
that
occurred
in
lawrence
and
in
coleman
were
attributed
to
--
to
the
petitioners
in
those
cases.
here,
however,
by
contrast,
mr.
holland
did
everything
he
could
--
he
could,
to
be
--
reasonably,
to
be
free
of--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--no,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--correct.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
correct
enough,
but
i
think
each
--
well,
certainly
those
were
some
of
the
individual
factors
that
the
eleventh
circuit
discussed
when
saying
gross
negligence
isn't
enough.
i
think
in
mr.
holland's
case--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--because
when
you
look
at,
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
when
we
are
talking
about
an
exceptional
circumstance,
you're
talking
about
a
lot
of
times
--
and
courts
have
done
this
--
is
the
confluence
of
what
the
attorney
did
or
didn't
do
versus
what
the
petitioner
did.
so
we
have,
of
course
--
along
the
lines
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances
here,
we
have
petitioner's
diligence.
and
in
some
respects
they
dovetail.
and
i
think
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
was
say
we
don't
care
what
the
petitioner
did;
we
don't
really
care
what
the
lawyer
did;
anything
the
lawyer
did
unless
the
lawyer
was
mentally
ill
or
had
divided
loyalties,
then
that's
--
those
are
the
only
factors
that
were
going
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
equitable
tolling.
but
that
is
--
that
is
antithetical
to
the
very
nature
of
equity.
here--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--that's
correct.
this
court,
however--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
concur
with
the
premise
that
those
four
particular
subsections
of
2244(d)
are
exceptions
or
--
or
are
tolling
provisions.
indeed,
this
court
in
jimenez
said
that
those
four,
(a),
(b),
(c)
and
(d),
are--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--eleven
circuits
--
all
of
the
circuits,
and
the
only
circuit
that
hasn't
held
that
is
the
d.c.
circuit
where
it
remains
an
open
question.
so
all
of
the
circuits
that
have
addressed--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--correct.
and,
in
fact--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--correct.
and,
certainly
here,
i
think
we
have
what
they
deemed
to
be
gross
negligence,
which
i
think
certainly
has
an
element
of,
let's
say,
for
example,
to
use
the
term
"recklessness".
i
mean,
we've
got
six
or
seven
circuits
which
have
addressed
this
particular
issue
in
terms
of
this
line
between
mere
negligence
and
--
and
something
more
than
that,
and
those
circuits
have
all
--
in
the
13
or
14
years
since
aedpa
has
been
around,
all
been
able
to
effectively
deal
with
these
particular
cases
on
their
particular
facts.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
i'm
not
familiar.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
well
--
and
i--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--yes.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
in
this
particular
case
or
in
another
case?
mr.
todd
g.
scher
there
are
certainly
some
cases
that
address
the
tolling
and
then,
of
course,
address
the
merits
of
the
petition.
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
that
link
the
two.
but,
certainly,
if
you
have,
for
example
--
the
respondent
has
argued
that
the
floodgates
are
just
going
open,
but
certainly
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
ways
that
a
federal
district
court
can
deal
with
this
and
has
dealt
with
this
in
the
past
13
years
is
to
look
at
the
petition.
and
if
the
petition
raises
something
that's
so
palpably
meritless,
you
don't
even
need
to
get
to
anything
about
whether
it's
--
just
dismiss
the
petition
because,
of
course,
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
aedpa
addresses
in
this
particular
chapter
are
noncapital
cases
and
are
pro
se
cases.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
in
the
petitioner's
case?
mr.
todd
g.
scher
he
had
--
well,
there
were
a
number
of
issues
that
he
raised
on
direct
appeal.
there
was
issues
regarding
counsel.
for
example,
i
know
in
the
postconviction
motion,
one
of
the
key
issues
was
he
had
a
what's
termed
in
florida
"a
nixon
issue",
which
is
where
counsel
conceded
some
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
but
--
but--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
what
happened
is
that
that
particular
explanation
came
up
after
the
fact.
i
think
what's
significant
about
that,
number
one,
is
that
his
explanations
have
been
a
moving
target
to
a
large
extent.
but
what's
even
more
important
is
that
none
of
that
information
was
ever
imparted
to
mr.
holland
while
the
case
was
pending.
while
mr.
collins
was
providing
assurances
and
reassurances
to
mr.
holland
--
about,
don't
worry,
your
state
postconviction
motion
will
be
filed
on
time,
your
federal
rights
will
be
honored,
everything
will
be
done,
your
appeal
will
be
taken,
once
we
are
done
in
the
florida
supreme
court
we
will
go
off
to
the
federal
district
court
--
at
no
time
did
mr.
collins
ever
say:
we've
got
a
big
problem
here;
the
statute
may
have
run,
and
so
we
need
to
start
thinking
in
advance
of
ways
to
deal
with
this.
for
example,
if
mr.
collins
truly
believed
that
the
statute
had
already
run,
the
day
the
florida
supreme
court
issued
that
decision,
he
should
have
been
in
federal
court
filing
something
right
away.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
the
test
is
the
test
that
this
court
has
applied,
which
is
in
pace
and
in
lawrence,
which
is
extraordinary
circumstances
coupled
with
diligence.
i
think
under
those
particular
--
coupled
with
diligence,
the
petitioner's
diligence.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
it's
--
it's
a
case-by-case
type
of
issue.
it's
because
it's
an
equitable
remedy.
it's
not
something
that's
susceptible
to
rigid
rules,
which
of
course
is
the
problem
with
the
eleventh
circuit's
categorical
exclusion
of
a
particular
large
chunk
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
attorney.
but
certainly
here,
where
we
have
extraordinary
circumstances,
we
have
lack
of
notice
to
the
petitioner
that
his
state
court
opinion
had
been
issued,
that
they
had
affirmed,
that
the
mandate
had
come
out;
and
a
failure
to
communicate,
wholesale
failure
to
communicate,
bordering
on,
in
fact,
abandonment--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--fourteen
days.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
well,
i
think
the
one--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
what
makes
this
case
i
think
unusual,
and
it's
the
first
type
of
case
that
this
court
has
seen,
is
under
these
circumstances
you
have
this
confluence
of
events.
and
i
think
what
makes
this
case
--
what
sets
this
case
apart
from
the
other
ones
that
this
court
has
seen
and
that
certainly
other
courts
have
seen
is,
for
example,
it's
extraordinary
--
or
it
was
diligent
for
mr.
holland
to
have
asked
the
florida
supreme
court
on
two
occasions
to
rid
himself
of
collins,
and
he
asked
to
proceed
pro
se.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
well--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
i
think--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--i
think
the
problem
we
have
here
with
mr.
holland
is
that
the
more
diligent
he
was,
the
more
the
respondent
and
the
lower
courts
have
said
he
should
have
done.
and
so
he
did
x,
y,
and
z;
they
say
you
should
have
done
a,
b,
and
c.
but
what
i
think
is
--
is
significant
here
is
he
was
stuck
with
this
lawyer.
he
tried
to
get
rid
of
the
lawyer.
the
state
filed
motions
saying
you
can't
--
not
only
can
you
not
fire
him,
you
can't
file
a
pro
se
motion
because
you
are
represented
by
the
lawyer.
so
all
mr.
holland
hears
from
the
courts
is
that:
you
can't
speak
to
us
and
we
can't
speak
to
you.
so
he's
stuck.
and
then,
of
course,
he's
writing
to
the
florida
supreme
court
clerk
begging
for
information,
and
in
fact
in
footnote
11
of
the
brief--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--well,
what
we
have,
your
honor,
is
if
you
look
on
page
11,
in
footnote
11,
mr.
holland
wrote
a
letter
to
the
florida
supreme
court
clerk,
toward
the
end
of
which
he
says:
"i'm
not
trying
to
get
on
your
nerves.
"
"i
would
just
like
to
know
exactly
what
is
happening
with
my
case
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
"
so
we
certainly
have
in
the
clerk's
office
--
and,
again,
that
was
on
page
11,
footnote
11.
it's
also
at
the
joint
appendix
at
146
to
147.
what
we
have
here
is
petitioner
putting
the
florida
supreme
court
on
explicit
notice
that
he
is
having
a
problem
with
his
lawyer,
and
further
--
earlier
in
that
particular
letter,
he
apologizes
to
the
clerk,
saying:
i'm
sorry
to
pester
you
with
these
--
with
these
requests,
but
if
i
had
a
lawyer
who
was
responding
to
my
letters
and
who
was
listening
to
me
and
who
would
send
me
the
documentations,
i
wouldn't
have
to
be
bothering
you,
but
this
is
the
situation
that
i'm
in.
and
then,
of
course,
he
tries
to
not
only
have
mr.
collins
substituted,
but
he
asks
to
go
pro
se.
that's
an
extraordinary
circumstance.
and
what
makes
it
even
further,
more
extraordinary
is
the
state
coming
in
and
saying,
no,
you
can't
not
only
do
that,
but
you
are
not
even
allowed
to
file
the
paperwork
asking
to
do
that.
and,
in
fact,
when
mr.
holland
did
file
his
pro
se
petition
in
federal
district
court,
the
state
moved
to
strike
it
because
he
was
represented
by
--
by
counsel.
and
so--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--i
think
not
only
under
my
--
i
think,
certainly,
courts
have
--
have
discussed
this,
that
that's
--
that's
just
an
unfortunate
mere
mistake.
but
i
think
certainly
we
don't
have
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
there
has
never
been
any
suggestion
that
there
was
any
miscalculation.
we
just
have
complete
abandonment
by
--
by
the--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--and
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
--
when
i
--
when
i
used
the
word
"abandonment",
i'm
--
i'm
referring
to,
of
course,
in
terms
of
abandonment
with
regard
to
preserving
--
enforcing
the
assurances
that
collins
had
made
with
respect
to
filing
the
petition.
and,
of
course,
he
also
had
told
--
that
--
mr.
holland
that
he
would
inform
him
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
decision,
because
that,
of
course,
is
the
triggering
date.
we
have
mr.
holland,
who
had
already
been
--
you
know,
asked
his
lawyer,
you
know,
please
file
certain
issues
in
my
case
and
please
keep
me
informed.
when
those
two
promises
and
assurances
were
not
kept
by
the
lawyer,
mr.
holland
at
that
point
has
reason
to
be
concerned
that
the
additional
promise,
which
is,
i
will
file
on
time,
was
not
going
to
be
honored.
and
so
mr.
holland
embarked
on
a
series
of
diligent
steps
in
order
to
get
some
information,
but
he
didn't
know
where
to
turn.
and,
then,
of
course,
for
example,
he
writes
to
the
clerk's
office
of
the
supreme
court.
sometimes
they
send
him
information;
sometimes
they
tell
him
to
send
a
check.
he
doesn't
know.
he
is
not
getting
any
consistency,
and
he's
certainly
not
getting
any
response
from
his
attorney.
then
he
files
these
motions
in
the
state
supreme
court,
which
are
opposed
by
the
state
as
nullities
because
he
is
represented
by
counsel.
he
then
writes
to
the
florida
supreme
court
saying,
can
you
give
me
the
information
about
your
web
site
--
maybe
i
can
have
some
friends
look
up
this
case.
because,
of
course,
he
knows
at
this
point
that
there
is
a
problem,
and
he
knows
that
the
triggering
date
for
the
filing
in
the
federal
petition
is
the
denial
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
issuance
of
the
mandate.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
i
think
the
--
the
distinction
that
i
was
making
--
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
a
difference
in
terms
of
paid
or
appointed
counsel,
but
here
where
you
have
appointed
counsel,
i
think
one
of
the
extraordinary
factors
is
the
state
coming
in
and
--
and
moving
to
strike
these
pro
se
pleadings,
telling
mr.
--
sending
a
signal
to
mr.
holland
that
you
are
stuck
with
collins,
you
can't
speak
to
the
supreme
court,
and
the
supreme
court
can't
speak
to
you.
everything
has
to
be
funneled
through
your
lawyer.
and,
of
course,
the
ironic
thing
is
that,
had
mr.
holland
been
permitted
to
proceed
pro
se,
he
would
have
gotten
copied
with
the
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
he
would
have
gotten
copied
with
the
mandate.
and
then
he
would
have
known
when
the
mandate
issued.
and
as
we
know,
when
he
found
out
--
i
mean,
the
other
extraordinary
factor
here
is
that
when
he
found
out
that
this
happened,
he
prepared
that
petition
that
day
and
mailed
it
the
next
day.
this
is
not
somebody
who
sat
on
his
rights.
he
didn't
start
complaining
and
writing
letters
and
bemoaning
his
situation.
he
took
action,
which
also
distinguishes
this
case
from
a
number
of
others.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
well,
because
in
lawrence
and
in
--
in
coleman
this
court
had
--
had
said
that
that
made
a
difference.
in
lawrence,
this
court
had
said
lawrence
was
out
of
luck
because
it's
not
like
he
asked
for
another
lawyer
or
asked
to
proceed
pro
se.
and
so
holland
--
and
so
lawrence
was
stuck.
i
would
respectfully
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
i
just
have
a
couple
of
brief
points.
first,
to
clarify,
the
respondent
argued
that
mr.
holland
never
asked
to
proceed
pro
se
in
the
state
court,
and
that's
just
incorrect,
and
it's
flatly
contradicted
by
their
brief
on
page
43,
where
they
write:
"holland
moved
to
replace
collins
with
another
attorney
(whom
holland
presumably
thought
would
raise
any
issues
holland
desired)
or
to
proceed
pro
se
if
substitute
counsel
could
not
be
appointed.
"
and
i
think,
again,
going
back
to
one
of
the
things
that
justice
breyer
was
discussing
with
respondent's
counsel,
was
i
think
that
that
--
the
problem
with
the
eleventh
circuit's
analysis
is
this
categorical
exclusion.
equitable
tolling
and
extraordinary
circumstances
have
to
be
considered
as
a
--
consider
all
the
circumstances,
and
so
to
categorically
exclude
this
one
particular
area,
we
submit,
is
what
the
problem
is
here.
and
we
also
do
have,
contrary
to
what
the
respondent
contended--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--that's
where
courts,
including
this
court,
have
drawn
the
line.
that
seems
to
be
the
floor,
but,
you
know,
obviously,
when
you
get
into
the
particular
circumstances
of
a
case,
that's
where
a
categorical
rule
excluding
a
particular
type
of
area
beyond
just
garden-variety
neglect
--
really,
that's
the
problem
here,
is
that
was
antithetical
to
the
notion
of
equity.
and
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
briefly
that
this
record
does
avail
itself
of
numerous
instances
where
mr.
holland
had
alleged
that
the
attorney
lied
to
him.
ja
--
in
the
joint
appendix
on
170,
mr.
holland
writes
that
mr.
collins
lied
to
him.
on
the
joint
appendix
on
194,
that
mr.
collins
deceived
him
and
misled
him--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--about
when
the
petition
was
going
to
be--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--these
were
in
the
context
of
mr.
collins
telling
mr.
holland
that
he
would
protect
his
federal
habeas
rights.
those--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--i
think
it
makes
it
more--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--i
think
it
makes
it
makes
it
more
extraordinary.
and
what
makes
that
situation
even
yet
more
extraordinary
is
where
the
client
has
tried
to
rid
himself
of
this
lawyer
on
a
number
of
occasions
or
to
go
pro
se,
precisely
because
he
has
been
experiencing
these
--
these
--
lack
of
trust
and
other
problems
in
terms
of
these
deceptions
from
his
lawyer,
so
he
was
really
hamstrung
by
the
time
that--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--it
was
too
late.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
i
think
in
terms
--
i
think
the
test
would
be
appropriate,
what
justice
breyer
articulated,
which
is--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--no,
no.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
no,
the
other
test,
the
other
test.
we
need
a
hurricane
exception
in
florida.
but
in
terms
of
the
eleventh
circuit
was
incorrect
in
excluding
this
particular
type
of
attorney
misconduct
and
negligence
because
that's
antithetical
to
equity,
and
so
i
think--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--i
certainly
think,
given
the
unique
facts
here,
we
have,
again,
the
confluence
of
circumstances.
we
have
the--
mr.
todd
g.
scher
--correct.
mr.
todd
g.
scher
well,
but
certainly
--
but
the
other
part
of
the
test
for
equitable
tolling
is
diligence,
and
i
think,
when
--
when
one
looks
at
the
--
at
the
body
of
case
law
that
has
developed
since
1997
on
the
issue
of
equitable
tolling
and
aedpa,
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
are
disposed
on
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
is
indiligent.
here,
of
course,
the
respondent,
if
i
heard
correctly,
is
now
conceding
that
the
petitioner
was
diligent.
and
so
there
are
certainly
other
ways
to
avoid
even
having
to
get
to
the
question
of
exceptional
circumstances;
for
example,
just
looking
to
the
diligence
prong.
but
here,
where
you
have
a
failure
to
notify,
you
have
the
failure
to
heed
the
instructions
from
a
client,
you
have
the
client
saying
you've
lied
to
me,
the
client
telling
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
this
lawyer
is
not
my
agent
anymore,
i
don't
want
him,
i
don't
trust
him,
he
has
misled
me,
he
has
deceived
me
--
all
of
those
factors
certainly
go
to
a
consideration
of
whether
equitable
tolling
should
be
warranted,
and
the
problem
here
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit
said
no,
categorically
no.
thank
you
very
much.
