of
course,
that
also
assumes
that
mcnally
was
correctly
decided
----
[laughter]
--and
i
don't
think
it
was.
may
i
ask
you
another
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--prompted
by
justice
kennedy's
question?
have
any
of
the
circuits
taken
a
look
at
the
probable
merit
of
the
underlying
claim
in
evaluating
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
in
this
particular
case.
but
justice
kennedy
says
it's
equally
unjust
to
the
client
whether
it's
negligence
or
gross
negligence,
and
i'm
just
asking
whether
in
any
of
the
reviews
of
this
issue,
that
you
are
familiar
with,
have
they
sometimes
looked
at
the
probable
merit
of
the
claim,
and
if
there
was
merit,
why,
you
were
more
disturbed
about
attorney
negligence,
whereas
if
it's
a
frivolous
claim,
they
wouldn't
be.
but
do
you
know
if
any
of
them
take
a
look
at
that
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
just
an
information
question
before
you
--
are
the
postconviction
lawyers
in
these
cases
that
are
appointed,
are
they
compensated
by
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
it
doesn't
go
to
the
merits,
but
i'm
really
curious.
the
lawyers
selected
for
postconviction
work,
which
i
understand
now
are
compensated
by
the
state,
are
they
selected
from
the
same
panels
as
the
lawyers
that
represent
defendants
generally
and
who
are
appointed
by
the
state
in
criminal
matters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
collateral
counsel
registry
is
a
different
group
of
lawyers
than
are
generally
appointed
in
criminal
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
