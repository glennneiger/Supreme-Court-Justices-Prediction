how
many
circuits
have
said
that
there
is
equitable
tolling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
it's
a
question
of
what
are
exceptional
circumstances
and
whether
it
has
to
be
something
deliberate,
which
is
what
the
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
--
yes,
if
it
was
bad
faith
--
if
it
was
a
lie,
a
deception--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
they're
drawing
the
line
between
intentional
and
--
and
without
intending
but
just
being
careless.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
scher,
one
point
that
you
didn't
mention,
but
you
did
i
thought
stress
it
in
your
brief,
was
that
counsel
here
said:
oh,
the
deadline
had
run
even
before
i
was
engaged,
even
before
i
was
appointed
to
represent
this
man,
so
there
was
nothing
that
i
could
do
for
him,
because
the
time
had
already
expired.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
never
asked
--
he
wrote
to
the
clerk,
but
he
never
asked
to
be
informed
when
the
judgment
came
down.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
are
--
you
seem,
from
what
you
just
said,
to
be
relying
on
a
distinction
between
paid
counsel,
who
is
just
as
careless,
and
court-appointed
counsel,
because
in
the
one
case
the
client
had
picked
that
attorney,
and
in
the
other
case,
the
client
was
given
this
attorney
by
the
state.
so
i
think
you're
suggesting
that
the
state
has
some
responsibility
when
it
provides
the
counsel.
but
before
you
said,
no,
your
answer
would
be
the
same
if
you
were
not
making
a
distinction
between
court-appointed
and
paid
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
state
--
the
state
has
no
responsibility
even
though
it
made
this
appointment?
so
you
agree
there's
no
difference,
whether
it
was
paid
counsel,
somebody
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
picked
to
represent
him,
and
someone
that
he
just
had
to
take
because
it's
what
the
state
gave
him?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
--
on
direct
appeal,
if
counsel
conducted
himself
this
way,
the
state
would
--
he'd
have
to
get
relief
because
the
state
would
have
the
burden,
but
not
--
not
on
collateral?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
say
--
it
is
--
you
could
categorically
excuse
ordinary
negligence
as
opposed
to
gross
negligence?
