justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
should
--
why
should
that
be?
two
cases.
two
criminal
defendants.
one
spends
a
lot
of
time
trying
to
find
the
most
competent
lawyer
he
can,
and
he
does.
he
finds
a
highly
skilled
lawyer,
who
makes
one
little
mistake
and
it's
negligence.
the
other
doesn't
care.
he
gets
a
lawyer
that's
really
incompetent,
and
the
lawyer
is
grossly
negligent.
now,
you
would
be
penalizing
the
client
who
exercised
the
most
diligence
under
your
rule.
i
don't
understand
the
--
the
justice
of
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
client
should
be
better
off,
not
worse.
now,
maybe
this
is
for
your
friend
on
the
other
side
to
answer
as
well,
but
i'm
not
sure,
even
following
justice
alito's
initial
line
of
questioning,
we
can
distinguish
between
gross
and
mere
negligence,
that
--
that
it's
even
fair
that
we
do
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
his
line
of
questioning,
but
it
seems
to
be
consistent
with
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what's
the
--
what's
the
point?
what's
the
justice
in
doing
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than
just
limit
the
number
of
cases
in
which
we
are
going
to
set
aside
convictions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
looked
in
the
brief
to
see
if
there
was
reference
to
the
merits,
underlying
merits
of
the
case.
can
you
just
tell
me
very
quickly
what
the
key
arguments
are,
if
we
ever
reach
the
merits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
shouldn't
probably
take
your
time
with
that.
i
will
look
at
the
state
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
client
--
this
client
was
sort
of
the
pesky
client,
but
apparently
knew
a
lot
more
about
aedpa
than
most
people
generally
do.
i
mean,
aedpa's
not
exactly
an
ordinary
term.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
suppose
you
have
a
client
who
is
just
bewildered.
he
doesn't
know
aedpa;
he
doesn't
know
federal
court.
why
should
he
be
in
any
worse
position
than
this
client?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
the
other
way
around.
this
fellow
knew
enough
that,
if
he
had
really
just
done
a
little
bit
more,
he
would
have
--
well,
he
tried
to
file
a
petition,
but
he
might
have
done
a
little
bit
more.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
uninformed
client,
the
ignorant
client,
could
never
have
approached
this.
i
don't
know
why
he
shouldn't
be
more
protected
than
your
client,
which
goes
back
to
justice
alito's
question.
i'm
not
sure
how
we
draw
this
line.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
also,
just
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
how
--
how
often
do
these
deadlines
missed
(a)
in
capital
cases
and
(b)
in
aedpa
cases?
do
you
have
any
statistics
on
that,
or
can
you
tell
us
from
your
experience?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
--
i
didn't
hear.
you
say
there
has
been
discipline
or
there--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
we
or
--
this
would
probably
be
the
congress
--
assuming
some
rule
maker
had
probably
be
the
congress,
assuming
some
rulemaker
had
authority
to
do
this,
would
it
make
sense
to
say
that
the
state
is
going
to
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling
on
a
rather
broad
standard
--
we're
going
to
give
equitable
tolling
often
--
unless
the
state
has
attorney
discipline
procedures,
so
that
this
happens
only
once
and
then
the
attorney
can
no
longer
practice
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
obviously,
what
we're
looking
for
is
some
sort
of
a
rule
to
keep
the
deadline,
and
if
we're
going
to
accommodate
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
to
have
--
to
have
some
rule
about
exceptional
--
exceptional
cases.
