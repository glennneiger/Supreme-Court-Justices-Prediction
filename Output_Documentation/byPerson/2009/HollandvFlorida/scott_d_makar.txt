mr.
scott
d.
makar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
we
believe,
is
decided
by
one
principle--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--yes,
they
are.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
i
can
tell
you
anecdotally
the
attorneys
that
handle
these
cases
in
florida,
that
the
equitable
tolling
issue
comes
up
with
some
regularity.
i'm
aware
of
three
cases
just
in
jacksonville
where
i
live
where
the
district
judge
there
has
had
evidentiary
hearings
and
has
looked
at
these
equitable
tolling
issues.
in
florida,
we
have
394
individuals
on
death
row,
and
those
cases
are
at
various
stages
in
the
litigation.
so
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
that
that
goes
on.
as
to
the
noncapital
cases,
we
know
that
the
system
is
flooded
with
habeas
petitions.
obviously,
most
of
those
are
unrepresented.
but
there
still
is,
in
those
cases
--
a
study
i
saw
recently,
a
2007
study
from
vanderbilt
university,
that
about
20
percent
of
those
cases
are
dismissed
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds.
i'm
inferring
from
that
that
there
is
some
equitable
tolling
action
going
on
there,
but
the
specific
amount
we're
not
sure
of.
but
certainly
in
both
the
capital
and
noncapital
area,
this
is
an
issue.
and
if
i
could
get
to
the
standard
here,
obviously,
we're
asking
this
court
to
use
the
analysis
it
has
done
in
other
cases
to
find
that
there
is
no
equitable
tolling
whatsoever.
we--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--precisely,
your
honor.
i
mean--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well
--
well,
there
are
some,
certainly,
safety
valves
if
there's
a
natural
disaster,
some--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well
--
well,
for
example,
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
were
recently
amended
to
allow
for
late
filing
when
the
courthouse
is
inaccessible.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
precisely,
your
honor.
and
we
think--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
two
responses.
number
one,
we
do
not
believe
that
equitable
tolling
was
intended
by
congress
under
this
complex
statute
of
limitations
for
all
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
exactly.
and
it
relates
to
the
same
result,
it
seems
--
to
the
same
result
as
this
court
came
to
in
beggerly
and
brockamp,
where
the
--
if
congress
intended
that
to
be
the
case,
that's
the
case.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
under
our
position
that
congress
intended
to
draw
a
very
clear
line,
no.
if
the
--
if
the
court
assumes
or
decides
there
is
some
sort
of
equitable
tolling,
then
that's
a
different
case,
and
--
and
in
those
situations
where
there's
something
beyond
the
incompetence
of
the
lawyer.
and
that's
our
rule.
if
the
court
decides
there
is
equitable
tolling
or
assumes
it
exists,
it
has
to
be
that
the
rule
that
the
incompetence
of
the
postconviction
counsel
cannot
be
a
basis
for
relief.
that's
what
this
court
has
essentially
said
in
lawrence
and
also
in
coleman,
and
also
what
congress
inferentially
said
in
--
in
2254(i).
so,
under
those
circumstances,
here
our
rule
works
because
you
don't
get
into
those
gradations
of
negligence,
you
know,
is
it
gross
negligence?
well,
how
gross?
and
the
bottom
line
here
in
this
particular
case,
of
course
--
and
the
court
has
asked
these
questions
here
--
is
what
really
happened
in
this
case?
all
you
had
was
a
lawrence
error,
which
was--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
the
answer
--
is
it
extraordinary?
the
answer
is
no.
this
is
common--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--it's
not
just
florida;
it's
nationwide
there's
--
there's
problem
with
this
complex
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
there
--
there
has
been
no
bar
discipline,
to
my
knowledge,
for
missing
a
deadline.
and
that
--
and
this
court
has
held
that
is
not
an
extraordinary
circumstance,
in
lawrence.
the
only--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--to
my
knowledge,
there
has
not
been
for
missing
a
deadline.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
perhaps
something
along
those
lines
legislatively
might
be
--
be
considered,
but
--
but
in
the
end,
what
we
have
here
is
garden-variety
attorney
negligence
miscalculating
and
missing
a
deadline.
the--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
let
me
clarify
that,
because
there's
a
misconception
going
on
here.
in
the
florida
supreme
court
postconviction
process,
collins
--
i'm
sorry,
holland
twice
filed
motions
to
remove
collins.
importantly,
holland
never
asked
to
go
pro
se.
that
is
incorrect.
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
134
and
149
--
those
are
the
two
pro
se
filings
that
holland
made
here.
in
both
of
those,
he
said:
i'm
having
a
conflict
with
my
lawyer.
my
lawyer
won't
do
what
i
want
him
to
do;
i
want
a
new
lawyer.
and
that's
all
he
said:
i
want
a
new
lawyer.
he
never--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--the
first
motion
was
stricken.
it
was
then
denied
because
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
that
point.
keep
in
mind,
this
is
in
the
state
postconviction
process.
this
is
not
where
the
federal
aedpa
deadline
and
so
forth
is
being
kicked
about.
in
fact,
there
is
really
no
discussion
whatsoever
about
what
the
actual
deadline
to
file
this
petition
was
at
all
in
the
record.
the
only
time
holland
asked
to
go
pro
se
in
any
court
filing
is
after
he
filed
the
pro
se
petition
in
federal
court
--
the
untimely
one.
he
then
shortly
thereafter
filed
an
emergency
motion
to
relieve
collins,
and--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no,
i
think
that
certainly
the
filing
of
the
motion,
i
think
perhaps
it
was
--
it
shouldn't
have
been
stricken
the
first
time,
but
the
court
then
on
the
merits
denied
it
the
second
time.
and
keep
in
mind
--
i
forget
who
alluded
to
it
--
this
has
been
somewhat
of
an
unusual
case
from
the
outset,
in
that
if
you
look
at
the
three
florida
supreme
court
opinions
that
have
been
issued
in
this
case,
it
shows
that
at
the
first
trial
holland
absented
himself
from
the
--
absented
himself
from
the
trial
and
he
had
to
watch
on
circuit
--
closed-circuit
tv
because
he
was
being
very
difficult.
and
then
in
the
second
trial,
we
had
two
faretta
hearings
amounting
to
hundreds
of
pages
in
which
the
florida
supreme
court
then
said,
well,
he
wants
to
represent
himself,
but
he
can't
conduct
himself
properly
and
so
forth.
and
also
there's
the
issue
of
his
--
his
--
there's
a
mental
issue
there
as
well,
that
he
has
raised
on
appeal
as
well.
so
the
court
--
the
florida
courts
are
sort
of
put
in
this
difficult
posture
of
saying,
we
want
you
to
have
counsel,
we
need
you
to
have
counsel
because
we
want
you
to
have
effective
representation,
but
then
throughout
the
process
here
it's
been
a
difficult,
difficult
number
of
decades,
essentially,
in
this
situation.
so
i
think
it's
an
unfair
characterization
to
say
that
the
florida
courts
and
also
the
office
of
attorney
general
who
--
who
routinely
moves
to
strike
these
--
it's
not
because
we're
trying
to
deny
anyone's
day
in
court.
it's
because
you
have
a
lawyer
and
they
have
to
speak
to
the
lawyer,
and
the
hybrid
representation
is
impermissible.
so--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--exactly.
and
--
and
that's
the
way
the
court's
decision
in
coleman
has
allocated
the
burdens
and
the
risks.
i
mean,
what
the
court
said
was
okay,
if
it's
a
direct
appeal
where
the
state
is
charged
with
that
responsibility,
that's
one
thing;
but
when
it's
postconviction,
it's
shifted.
the
whole
paradigm
and
whole
structure
is
flipped
the
other
way,
and
you,
the
petitioner,
bear
the
burden,
and
not
the
state.
this
is
important
under
aedpa,
because
aedpa--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--sure.
on
direct
appeal,
if
the
lawyer
is
deemed
to
be
ineffective,
then
that
would
be
a
constitutional
error,
and
that
would
be
subject
to
some
sort
of
relief,
but
it
flips
in
the
postconviction
stage,
as
this
court
has
held
in
coleman.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
i
think
two
responses
there:
obviously,
we
believe
that
attorney
incompetence
or
so
forth
cannot
be
a
basis
for
equitable
tolling.
these
other
situations
about
natural
disasters
and
hypotheticals
where
some,
you
know,
very
unusual,
bizarre
situation
comes
in
that's
external
to
the
attorney-client
relationship,
perhaps
those
--
those
could
be
considered.
but
we
believe
that
the
congress,
through
its
purpose
in
enacting
this
statute
of
limitations,
a
complex
one
that
has
exceptions,
that
--
that
is
designed
to
alleviate
the
burdens
and
delays
--
its
intent
was
not
to
allow
equitable
tolling,
because
we--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--but
that
can
be
rebutted.
that
can
be
rebutted,
and
we
believe
has
been
rebutted
by
the
record
here,
which
shows
that
these
are
precisely
the
kind
of
delays
that
congress
intended
to
avoid
by
having
a
strict
1-year
statute
of
limitations,
that
there's
burdens
put
on
--
not
just
the
states
but
the
courts--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--sure.
well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--sure.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
under
the
structure
of
the
brockamp
decision,
what
the
court
looked
at
there
to
determine
when
there
is
no
equitable
tolling
intended
by
congress,
that
here
likewise
there
is
no
equitable
tolling,
and
as
the
court
held
in
brockamp,
the
fact
that
there
may
be
unfairness
in
individual
cases
was
the
price
congress
was
willing
to
pay,
the
tradeoff
it
was
willing
to
allow,
to
have
a
habeas
system
that
was
functioning.
now,
assuming
that
position
is
rejected
by
the
court
or
the
court
assumes
equitable
tolling,
the
next
question
is
what
should
be
allowed.
and
we
believe
it
has
to
be
exceptionally
narrow.
and
certainly
in
this
case
--
and
this
case
is
all
about
attorney
negligence
or
attorney
gross
negligence
--
those
--
those
sort
of
circumstances
are
not
enough.
and--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
we
agree
with
the
eleventh
circuit
standard
to
the
extent
it
says,
you
know,
that
this
sort
of
attorney
negligence,
gross
negligence,
incompetence,
is
not
enough.
where
we
differ
from
the
eleventh
circuit
is
we're
concerned,
based
upon
our
pragmatic
day-in,
day-out
handling
of
these
cases,
that
when
you
say
dishonesty,
well
--
or
a
conflict
--
that
those
concepts
can
be
conflated
into
things
that
they
are
not,
particularly
when
these
communications
between
lawyer
and
client
are
outside
the
state's
view.
we
are
not
privy
to
what
goes
on
between
lawyer
and
client.
the
lawyer
says,
i
will
do
this,
says
it
verbally
or
maybe
even
in
writing.
we
don't
know
about
that.
we're
not
privy
to
all
that.
and
it
creates
this
potential,
when
we
allow
the
standard,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
held
--
we
allow
the
standard
to
gravitate
away
from
its
core
purpose
and
allows
it
to
be
used
to
sort
of
game
the
system
in
a
way
to
gain
an
advantage.
that's
why
we
are
concerned
about
any
degree
of
attorney
misconduct
or
behavior
because
it
could
easily--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--unfortunately,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
data
on
that.
there
are
not
that
many.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
we
say
it's
not
because
congress
intended
not
to
have
equitable
tolling,
and
then
to
the
extent
it
did,
it
could
have
drafted
something
along
the
lines
of
what's
in
2263,
which
is
the
next
chapter
--
it's
the
companion
chapter
that
says
instead
of
having
365
days
with
no
equitable
tolling,
you
can
have
180
days
and
30
days
for
good
cause
if
there's
a
deadline
missed--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
under
these
facts--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--meaning
the
eleventh
circuit's
standard?
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
that
goes
to
the
issue
that
--
of
not
--
of
diligence,
of
course,
which
is
not
the
issue
we're
looking
at.
we're
looking
at
the
extraordinary
circumstances,
not
the
diligence.
extraordinary
circumstance
has
to
be
something
that
--
attributable
to
the
lawyer
or
something
along
those
lines.
we're
not
--
we'll
concede
diligence
for
the
moment
and
say
here
it's
what
the
lawyer
did,
as
lawrence
held.
he
missed
the
deadline.
in
fact,
this
case
--
you
know,
lawrence,
obviously
--
it
was
364
days
before
they
even
filed
the
state
postconviction
motion,
and
the
lawyer
in
that
case
wasn't
appointed
for
300
days,
and
the
state
postconvictions
process
was
sort
of
in
disarray.
and
all
those
things
that
the
court
in
lawrence
said
are
not
supportable
for
equitable
tolling
apply
equally
here.
the
only
difference
in
this
case
is
this
allegation
about
the
--
the
lawyer
didn't
communicate
with
his
client.
well,
if
that
becomes
the
governing
rule,
all
is
lost,
because
attorney
communication
with
client
is
perhaps
even
more
amorphous
a
concept.
it
could
be
based
on
verbal
representations
and
so
forth.
so
we
are
very
concerned
that
it
not
slip
into
that
sphere
where
it
can
be
easily
manipulated
for
the
advantage
of
getting
some
sort
of
delay.
and
as
i
say,
the
analysis
here
of
purpose
of
aedpa,
structure
of
aedpa,
and
the
burdens
--
as
i
say,
the
burdens
are
important
to
the
state
and
to
the
court
system.
i
was
looking
at
that
recent
study,
the
2007
study,
that
seemed
to
suggest
that
aedpa
is
--
basically,
when
these
cases
are
being
filed
in
federal
district
court,
it
has
taken
a
year
and
a
half
to
2,
3
years
for
them
to
be
resolved,
and
in
this
case
keep
in
mind
it
took
18
months
in
the
district
court,
18
months
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
then
further.
but
that's
allowing
the
invocation
of
this
doctrine,
not
just
in
this
case.
we're
worried
about
the
noncapital
context
as
well,
that
that
will
somehow
put
an
end
to
the
importance
of
what
congress
enacted.
there
is
a
pre-aedpa
mentality
out
there,
i'm
afraid.
and
it's
natural.
it's
understandable.
we're
all
human.
there's
a
pre-aedpa
mentality
that
there
must
be
a
remedy.
there
must
be
some
equity
done.
and
i
think
that
sort
of
undergirds
why
perhaps
most
of
the
circuits
have
either
assumed
--
i
think
11
have
either
assumed
or
adopted
some
sort
of
equitable
tolling.
i
think
they
are
waiting
for
this
court,
which
has
left
the
question
open
to
provide
guidance
on
that
issue,
and
we
suggest
that
either
there
be
no
equitable
tolling
or
that,
if
there
is
to
be
equitable
tolling,
on
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
has
to
be
extreme
attorney
misconduct
or
incompetence,
and
that
just
simply
is
not
established
on
this
record.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
i
guess
the
short
answer,
of
course,
is
the
courts
have
said
no,
that's
not
enough,
we
need
something
that's
truly
extreme,
something
far
from
just
missing
a
deadline.
we
probably
all
know
lawyers
who
have
missed
deadlines.
we
all
know
lawyers
who
haven't
communicated
with
their
clients.
those
things
are
ordinary,
run-of-the-mill,
happen-every-day
sort
of
events.
it
has
to
be
something
beyond
that.
it
has
to
be
something
that
is
truly
extreme
for
the
exception
to
kick
in.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i
mean,
the
example
i've
tossed
about
in
our
conversations
is
--
is
to
say,
well,
what
if
the
postconviction
lawyer
is
bribed
by
the
victim's
family
to
not
file
something
on
time?
i
mean,
oh
gosh,
that
strikes
us
all
as
just
--
that's--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no.
no.
but
the
question
i
thought
you
were
asking
is,
you
know,
how
extreme
can
we
think
about
a
situation,
and
--
and--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--it
has
to
be
something
beyond
just
attorney
incompetence.
what
the
--
that's
a
concept
that
we
can
get
our
arms
around,
and
we
certainly
get
into
this
line-drawing
of,
well,
is
a
failure
to
communicate
three
or
four
times
enough?
or
a
failure
to
have
a
letter
go
to
the
client
in
response
to
his
request
--
is
that
enough?
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
there's
a
collateral
counsel
registry
list.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
there's
actually
what
they
call
ccrc.
there's
actually
state
lawyers
around
the
state
who
provide
this,
and
then
there's
a
registry
list
as
well.
and
they
have
to
meet
certain
standards.
chapter
27
of
our
florida
statutes
set
out
the
standards
that
these
counsel
have
to
meet.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
yes.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
your
honors,
if
there's
no
further
questions,
we
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit
below,
either
on
the
basis
that
there's
no
equitable
tolling
or
that
on
this
record
there's
no
basis
for
it
under
the
attorney
incompetence
standard.
thank
you.
