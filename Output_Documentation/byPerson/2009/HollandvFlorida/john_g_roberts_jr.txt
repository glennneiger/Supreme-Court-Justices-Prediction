chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-5327,
holland
v.
florida.
mr.
scher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
case
different
if
the
filing
error
--
i
understand
there
was
a
lot
going
on,
but
if
the
lawyer
just
miscalculated
the
days
and
was
off
by
one
day,
this
case
comes
out
the
other
way
in
your
view,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i
understand
what
the
cases
have
said.
i
--
i
have
trouble
understanding
why
that
should
make
a
difference,
why
that
should
be
so
pertinent,
why
he
should
be
in
better
shape
than
somebody
who
says:
look,
i
don't
know
anything
about
this.
i
need
a
good
lawyer.
this
is
what
i
get.
i'm
trusting
you.
tell
me
what
i
should
do,
and
i
leave
it
in
your
hands.
and
that
person
is
in
somehow
worse
shape?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
makar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i'm
concerned
about
some
of
the
situations
justice
breyer
mentions,
you
know,
if
there
is
an
earthquake,
a
plane
crash,
but
the
law
seems
to
be
focusing
on
other
things
when
it's
talking
about
extraordinary
circumstances.
like
here,
we're
talking
about
how
diligent
he
was
in
pursuing
his
lawyer.
there
seems
to
be
a
disconnect
there.
i
don't
know
why
--
i
mean,
assuming
we're
going
to
have,
for
argument,
equitable
tolling,
what
should
we
be
looking
at?
the
unusual
nature
of
the
situation
that
comes
up,
or
whether
you've
got
a
pesky
client?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
legislated
against
the
background
of
cases
like
irwin
that
stated
the
general
proposition
is,
unless
congress
says
otherwise,
there
is
equitable
tolling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
--
you're
not
worried
about
justice
breyer's
case
of
the
really
extraordinary
circumstance
where
everybody
would
say,
well,
that's
--
you
know,
we
understand.
you're
worried
that
if
you
create
an
exception,
that
all
sorts
of
other
stuff
will
come
in.
and
so
why
isn't
the
answer
to
that
concern
that
you've
got
an
unusual
case
here
where
you
do
have
the
client
saying,
do
this,
do
this,
do
this,
and
the
lawyer
doesn't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
very
hard
to
argue
against
--
against
equity,
against
equitable
tolling.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
you
do
need
a
constraining
principle
that
it
doesn't
do
away
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
why
isn't
what
we
have
here
good
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
meaning
the
fact
that
you
have
got
a
client
who
is
constantly
telling
the
lawyer,
do
this,
you
know,
get
it
done;
doesn't
get
the
judgment.
and,
you
know,
it's
not
just
your
run-of-the-mill
case
where
the
lawyer
happens
to
miss
a
deadline.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
why
isn't
it
extreme
attorney
incompetence
to
miss
a
deadline?
i
mean,
you
either
miss
it
or
you
don't.
it's
not
going
to
get
--
why
doesn't
that
qualify
as
extreme
attorney
misconduct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
give
me
an
example.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
worse
than
missing
the
deadline.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
don't
--
that's
not
negligence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
--
it
has
to
be
criminal
behavior?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
scher,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i'm
worried--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
i'm
worried
about
the
open-ended
nature
of
what
you're
asking
for,
how
--
how
would
you
state
the
test
you
would
like
in
the
most
restrictive
terms?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
hurricane
or
kidnapping?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
the
different
one.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
type
--
the
problem
comes
up
when
you
say
"this
type
of
attorney
negligence".
what
is
your
test?
what
type
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i
know
your
test
will
mean
your
client
wins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
i
mean,
can
you
articulate
it
more
--
because
i'm
very
concerned
that
if
you
start
saying,
well,
you
can
forgive
an
inequitable
case,
every
time
a
case
comes
up,
you're
going
to
--
there's
going
to
be
sympathy
for
the
client.
the
lawyer
goofed.
of
course,
you
don't
want
to
penalize
the
client,
but
congress
obviously
had
something
more
in
mind.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
