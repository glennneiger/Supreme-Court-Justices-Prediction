justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
to
imply
that
earthquake,
fire,
flood,
mad
postman
burns
mail
truck,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
even
if
it's
a
terrible
earthquake,
all
these
people
are
just
out
of
luck?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why?
natural
disaster,
yes,
you
said
no
equitable
tolling,
they're
out
of
luck?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
so,
are
you
--
you
read
the
statute
to
say
in
some
cases,
you
could
do
it.
if
you're
going
to
read
it
in
some
cases
you
can
do
it,
then
i
guess
we're
at
a
discussion
of
is
this
one
of
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
earthquake,
fire,
flood,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
should
it
matter?
it's
certainly
unusual.
isn't
that
what
we
are
after,
one,
is
he
diligent?
answer,
yes,
he
has
been
diligent.
two,
is
it
extraordinary?
i
would
think
it
was
fairly
extraordinary
that
a
person
writes
these
letters
to
counsel
and
so
forth,
then
the
--
the
thing
isn't
filed.
is
that
extraordinary
or
not?
whether
it
was
his
fault,
whether
he
himself
was
kidnapped.
i
mean,
maybe
it
wasn't
the
counsel's
fault.
you
can
imagine
a
lot
of
circumstances.
but
the
question,
i
would
think,
is,
is
it
extraordinary
and
is
it
fair?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
counsel
in
florida
often
when
--
miss
deadlines
and
so
forth
when
their
counsel
--
when
their
client
specifically
says
to
them,
even
a
few
weeks
before
and
by
mail
several
times,
please
file
such-and-such,
is
not
extraordinary
in
florida?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
a
problem
with
the
bar,
don't
we,
if
--
if
--
if
the
--
if--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
could
you
not
say
here
--
i
mean,
the
key
sentence,
i
take
it,
is
the
eleventh
circuit
and
it
says:
"no
allegation
of
lawyer
negligence
or
failure
to
meet
the
standard
of
care.
"
--none
--
without
"proof,
bad
faith,
dishonesty,
mental
impairment.
"
on
the
part
of
the
lawyer,
could
ever
qualify.
now,
that's
--
so
we
just
say,
no,
no,
that
isn't
so.
sometimes
it
could,
when
combined
with
other
circumstances.
and
then
go
back
and
let
them
--
i
don't
know
what
this
particular
individual
petitioner's
prior
conduct
has
been.
i
understand
the
problems
that
you
have.
but
do
you
--
i
guess
you're
going
to
say
no
to
this,
but
--
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
why
you
couldn't
have
a
narrow
standard
but
just
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
under
certain
circumstances,
just
negligence
or
even
less
--
maybe
the
lawyer
wasn't
even
at
fault;
maybe
he
got
kidnapped.
you
know,
i
mean,
there
are
odd
things
that
happen
in
life.
and
just
say
go
look
for
this;
see
if
it's
truly
extraordinary,
if
it's
fair,
if
he
was
diligent.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
would
there
be
--
i
mean,
what
i'm
actually
worried
about
is
not
a
lawyer
being
kidnapped.
i'm
actually
worried
what
can
happen
in
a
person's
life.
he
gets
deathly
ill.
his
wife
gets
sick.
something
happens
to
the
children.
some
very
unusual
thing
comes
along
at
the
last
minute,
and
all
the
plans
go
awry.
and
to
have
a
little
bit
of
flexibility
in
this
statute
to
take
care
of
those
very
unusual
human
circumstances
seems
a
reasonable
reading
of
it.
but
you
say
it's
not
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
the
second
case
is
holland
versus
florida
that
a
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
with
certain
exceptions
gives
a
state
prisoner
one
year
from
the
time
a
state
court
conviction
becomes
final,
until
the
time
he
must
file
a
habeas
petition
in
federal
court.
the
answer
in
this
case,
two
questions
related
to
the
running
of
that
one
year
period.
first,
is
that
statute
of
limitations
subject
to
the
doctrine
of
equitable
tolling?
that
doctrine
means
that
a
judge
can
toll
i.e
postpone
the
running
of
the
statute
for
strong
equitable
reasons.
the
doctrine
would
permit
a
federal
judge
to
extend
the
one
year
habeas
corpus
time
limit,
provided
there
are
sufficiently
strong
equitable
grounds
for
doing
so.
eleven
courts
of
appeals
upheld
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
tolling
does
apply.
federal
statutes
of
limitations
are
normally
subject
to
this
kind
of
tolling
and
we
can't
find
any
good
reason
here
for
departing
from
that
nor.
to
the
contrary,
the
underlying
subject
matter
habeas
corpus
is
itself
an
equitable
remedy
and
that
fact
makes
application
of
the
equitable
tolling
doctrine
a
particularly
suitable
thing
to
do.
so
like
the
others,
we
hold
it
applies.
second,
did
the
court
of
appeals
properly
apply
the
doctrine
in
this
case?
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
where
a
prisoner
seeks
equitable
tolling
on
the
ground
that
his
lawyer
behaved
badly,
the
petitioner,
the
prisoner
can
succeed
in
showing
he
needs
equitable
tolling
only
if
he
proves
quote
bad,
faith,
dishonesty,
divided
loyalty,
mental
impairment
and
so
forth.
in
our
view
this
standard
is
too
rigid.
equitable
doctrines
are
by
their
very
nature,
more
flexible
and
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
applied
a
more
flexible
test
set
out
in
our
prior
cases
i,e
equitable
tolling
may
be
justified,
one,
in
extraordinary
circumstances
as
long
as,
two,
the
petitioner
has
been
indulged
in
seeking
his
remedies.
we
believe
there
is
adequate
judicial
precedent
to
guide
this
for
courts
in
applying
this
more
general
standard.
given
the
facts
of
this
case
which
we
set
out
in
our
opinion,
the
petitioner
maybe
entitled
to
equitable
tolling
under
this
more
flexible
standard.
so
we
remand
the
cases
to
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
it
can
reconsider
them.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins
in
part.
