justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
--
what
in
the
record
shows
us
that
the
failure
to
tell
him
that
by
the
lawyer
was
anything
other
than
negligence?
what
in
the
record
suggests
that
the
lawyer,
just
as
many
lawyers
do,
forgot
to
call
the
client,
forgot
to
send
him
something?
what
shows
that
this
is
more
than
negligence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
the
basis
for
that
finding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
what
his
intent
was.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
people
say
i'm
going
to
do
something,
and
they
fail
to
do
it
often
because
something
else
comes
up,
because
something
has
happened.
that
doesn't
show
intentionality
in
--
the
failure
to
act
doesn't
necessarily
prove
that
it
was
intentional.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
there
should
be
a
different
standard
for
those
habeas
petitioners
who
are
--
whose
counsel
is
appointed
for
them
by
the
state
or
by
the
federal
government,
as
opposed
to
just
a
lawyer
they
hire?
that's
what
i'm
hearing
you
say.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
if
the
standard
is
going
to
be
the
same
--
i
--
i
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
which
is,
the
eleventh
circuit
is
saying
negligence/gross
negligence,
the
line
is
too
fine
to
draw.
but
there
is
a
difference
in
a
line
between
negligence,
however
one
defines
it,
and
an
intentional,
bad
faith,
dishonest,
conflicted
malfeasance.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
why
isn't
that
a
more
workable
line,
given
that
you
can't
have
equitable
tolling
without
exceptional
circumstances?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
argued
why
not,
is
what
i'm
saying
to
you.
if
exceptional
circumstances
has
to
mean
something
that
really
makes
something
exceptional,
why
is
negligence
of
any
variant
exceptional?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
--
you
say
--
you
say
"complete
abandonment".
but
this
lawyer
filed
a
whole
lot
of
things
on
behalf
of
this
client.
he
missed
a
very
critical
thing,
the
federal
habeas
filing.
but
it's
not
abandonment
of
a
client
in
the
sense
of
not
doing
anything
for
the
client.
so
it
goes
back
to
my
beginning
question,
which
is,
where
is
the
line
drawn
between
the
types
of
negligence
and
what
the
circuit
suggested,
which
is
some
sort
of
intentional
malfeasance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
go
back
to
just--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
--
what
i
worry
about
is
that
you're
confusing
the
--
or
perceive
--
confusing
the
fact
that
lawyer
negligence
may
not
be
the
type
of
situation
that
congress
was
looking
at.
with
the
hypotheticals
that
justice
breyer
listed,
which
are
a
different
kind
of
situation,
and
you
are
trying
to
pigeonhole
both
and
say
congress
didn't
intend
for
both
to
be
covered.
and
yet
you
suggested
a
little
later
that
they
may
have
intended
what
justice
breyer
was
thinking
about.
i
--
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
structure
of
the
statute
that
would
preclude
what
justice
breyer
listed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
can
we
read
to
suggest
that
--
forget
about
the
lawyer
malfeasance;
let's
talk
just
about
equitable
tolling--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
its
traditional
sense.
most
of
the
cases
in
equitable
tolling,
by
the
way,
have
to
do
with
court
errors.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
idea,
before
the
eleventh
circuit
announced
its
standard,
how
many
habeas
petitions
were
tolled
by
district
courts
in
that
--
in
your
--
in
florida,
on
the
basis
of
equitable
tolling,
that
--
that
they
permitted
petitions
to
go
forward
after
the
statute
of
limitations?
