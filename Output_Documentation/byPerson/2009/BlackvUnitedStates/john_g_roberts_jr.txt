chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-876,
conrad
black
et
al.
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
theory
--
your
theory
that
return
to
the
pre-mcnally
cases
would
help
you
is
based
almost
entirely
on
the
d.c.
circuit
case
--
case
in
lemire
--
lemire.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
--
the
government
tells
us
it
was
an
outlier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
say
you
have
a
bank
that
is
going
to
be
opening
up
a
lot
of
branches
in
the
state,
and
one
of
the
directors
knows
this
and
knows
where
they
are
going
to
open
them.
and
he
goes
around
and
buys
up
the
real
estate
where
the
bank
is
going
to
put
its
--
put
its
branch,
so
that
he
gets
the
benefit
of
the
--
of
the
sale.
and
assume
that
the
price
that
--
that
he's
going
to
charge
is
a
fair
market
price,
no
different
than
what
anybody
else
would
charge.
now,
is
that
sort
of
self-dealing
covered
under
your
view
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
is
not
stealing
--
he
is
not
stealing
the
confidential
information.
as
the
director,
he
has
the
perfect
right
to
know
the
confidential
information.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
call
it
a
corporate
--
i
don't
know
if
i
would
call
it
a
corporate
opportunity.
they
are
not
looking
to
sell
the
land;
they
need
to
buy
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
presumably,
the
one
thing
it's
odd
to
suggest
congress
did
was
sort
of
run
1346
through
1341,
when
what
it
was
trying
to
fix
was
the
court's
understanding
of
what
1341
provided.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
in
the
record
do
we
find
your
argument
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
were
--
i
think
you
were
about
to
tell
me
where
you
raised
it
in
the
court
--
the
constitutional
argument
in
this
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
mr.
dreeben,
you
agree
that
it
would
be
very
unusual
if
in
june
we
announced
the
opinion
in
your
case
agreeing
with
you
and
then
the
next
case
announced
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
that
--
does
the
right
to
intangible
services
refer
to
an
obligation
that
is
legal
or
moral?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
only
--
only
legal?
so
that
if
in
a
state
their
corporate
law
says
conflicts
of
interest
with
respect
to
spouse
and
children
must
be
disclosed,
but
conflicts
of
interest
with
respect
to
nieces
and
nephews
need
not,
you
would
say
you
cannot
use
this
statute
to
prosecute
somebody
who,
under
some
abstract
sense,
should
have
told
their
employer
that,
"my
niece
is
going
to
get
$10
million
if
we
go
ahead
with
this
contract?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
could
i
ask
--
could
i
ask
you
just,
in
terms
--
the
terms
of
the
statute,
does
your
theory
give
any
independent
substance
to
the
word
"right"?
it
seems,
to
me,
your
argument
is
that
--
that
someone
who
deprives
another
of
honest
services.
i
don't
know
where
the
concept
of
"right"
comes
in,
which
is
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
point
--
i
guess
maybe
this
is
--
maybe
i
asked
you
this
before.
the
--
the
right
is
not
limited
to
specific
legal
obligations,
but
to
a
developing
federal
common
law
of
criminal
liability?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
estrada,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
submitted.
