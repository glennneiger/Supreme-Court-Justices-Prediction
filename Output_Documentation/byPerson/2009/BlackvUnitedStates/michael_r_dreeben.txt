mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
petitioner
today
has
sought
to
present
a
question
to
this
court
that
he
chose
not
to
include
in
his
questions
presented,
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague
in
all
of
its
applications.
what
he
did
present
in
his
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
there
is
an
element
of
contemplated
economic
harm
inherent
in
the
concept
of
fraud
in
section
1341,
so
that
any
honest
services
prosecution
must
show
contemplated
or
foreseeable
economic
harm
in
order
to
be
sustained.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--maybe
you
should
wait
for
a
petitioner
who
presents
the
question,
rather
than
granting
relief
to
a
petitioner
who
chose
not
to
raise
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
the
court
should
reach
that
issue,
the
issue
whether
there
is
contemplated
economic
harm
as
a
requirement
for
the
statute,
and
the
government
briefed
that
issue,
and
i
disagree
with
petitioner
that
contemplated
economic
harm
is
either
an
element
of
the
statute
or
necessary
to
save
its
constitutionality--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
this
statute
is,
justice
kennedy,
is
congress's
effort
to
reinstate
the
body
of
law
that
this
court
held
was
not
a
valid
construction
of
the
mail
fraud
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
the
court
wished
to
address
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
the
government
would
brief
it
more
fully,
including
by
making
the
points
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
skilling
case
raises
the
question
of
whether
if
this
court
does
not
interpret--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
the
court
believes
that
that
is
a
necessary
question
to
resolve,
then
it
should
be
briefed
in
a
supplemental
passage--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
not
in
this
case,
because
i
think
if
a
petitioner
comes
to
this
court
and
presents
a
particular
statutory
construction
question
and
then
seeks
to
smuggle
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
because
in
skilling,
justice
sotomayor,
the
question
is
whether
an
element
of
personal
or
private
gain
needs
to
be
read
into
the
statute
in
order
to
render
it
constitutional.
now,
in
all
fairness
to
mr.
skilling,
he
has
not
filed
his
opening
brief;
the
government
has
not
filed
its
response.
so
that
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
case
may
present
a
--
a
different
issue.
but
again,
i
--
i
think
that
if
a
petitioner
wishes
to
come
to
this
court
and
say
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague
in
all
of
its
applications,
this
is
not
a
statute
that
offends
first
amendment
rights
or
anything--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--agreed.
[laughter]
i
would
vastly
prefer,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
court
hold
that
it
is
constitutional.
and
i
think
that
it
should,
because
--
let
me
outline--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
probably
a
fair
characterization
of
language
in
his
brief,
but
it
does
bear
note
that
he
never
asked
this
court
to
decide
that
question.
now,
the
question
that
is
before
the
court,
and
i
think
it
will
illuminate
the
vagueness
concerns
that
are
on
the
justice's
minds,
is:
what
does
the
statute
mean?
and
the
way
to
understand
this
statute
is
to
recognize
that
when
this
court
held
in
mcnally
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
did
not
protect
intangible
rights,
congress
came
back
in
response
to
this
court's
invitation
and
said:
yes,
it
does;
it
protects
the
intangible
right
of
honest
services
which
had
assumed
the
status
of
a
term
of
art
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
description
of
the
lower
courts
as
massively
confused
is
not
correct.
it's
not
a
fair
description
of
the
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
all
of
the
lower
courts
used
essential
synonyms
for
what
congress
sought
to
reinstate.
they
refer
to
the
right
of
honest
services,
faithful
and
honest
services,
loyal
and
honest
services,
and
they
were
talking
about
one
thing:
divided
loyalties
of
an
agent
or
a
fiduciary.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
i
hope
you
give
me
a
moment
to
explain
my
theory
of
the
statute
in
response
to
your
question.
the
statute
covers
bribes,
kickbacks,
and
undisclosed
conflicts
of
interest
by
an
agent
or
fiduciary
who
takes
action
to
further
that
interest.
these
were
well-recognized
categories
of
honest
services
violations.
virtually
every
circuit
that
examined
the
pre-mcnally
case
law
said
these
are
the
prototypical
cases.
bribes,
kickbacks,
undisclosed
conflicts
of
interest
by
an
agent
or
fiduciary
who
takes
action
to
further
that
interest.
these
are
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--legal,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
obligation
under
1346
is
a
federal
obligation.
congress,
by
reinstating
this
body
of
law,
by
virtue
of
1346,
created
a
federal
obligation
that
is
not
dependent
on
state
law.
and
i
think
we
will
address
this
more
in
the
weyhrauch
case,
where
that
issue
is
specifically
presented,
but
it
should
not
be
understood
as
a
state
law
obligation.
second,
the
core--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
line
is
personal
conflicting
financial
interests
of
the
individual,
which--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
prefer
not
to
address
the
skilling
case
until
that
has
been
briefed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
trying
to
do
that,
justice
sotomayor.
a
personal
conflicting
financial
interest
is
not
subtle,
it
is
ascertainable,
it
is
core,
it
is
the
characterizing
feature
of
the
vast
majority
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
know
what
professor
altshuler's
alternative
b
was.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
not
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
the
same
thing
and
i
think
this
goes
back--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
causing
economic
harm
because
there
are
instances
where
important
fiduciary
relationships
are
breached
personally.
for
example,
doctor-patient,
lawyer-client,
union-union
representative,
where
the
harms
are
intangible;
they
are
noneconomic;
they
were
intended
to
be
picked
up
by
this
statute.
but
to
answer
your
question
directly,
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
--
that
is
--
implicates
a
--
one
of
the
two
important
limiting
principles
on
this
statute
which
is
materiality
and
intent
to
defraud.
and
i
do
not
think
that
any
jury
would
find
and
the
government
would
be
very
foolish
to
prosecute
that
material--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
the
point
that
i
was
making
is
that
this
statute
does
not
establish
a
free-floating
federal
crime
based
on
a
breach
of
a
trivial
duty.
it
requires
materiality,
as
all
fraud
statutes
do;
it
requires--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
issue
of
materiality--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
agree,
justice
sotomayor,
but
materiality
as
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
rybicki
opinion
is
a
time-tested
way
of
separating
out--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--with
all
respect--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
sotomayor,
the
second
circuit
in
its
rybicki
opinion
in
the
en
banc
opinion
did
not
say
that,
nor
i
think
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
second
circuit
had
ever
said
that
economic
loss
was
an
element
of
an
intangible
rights
fraud,
either
pre-mcnally
or
post-mcnally.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
materiality,
justice
scalia,
it
takes
the
classic
definition
of
your
opinions
for
the
court
in
kungis
and
gaudin
as
reasonably
likely
to
affect
the
decision
of
the
body
to
whom
the
statement
is
made.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
government
proves
that
it
would
be.
and
i
should
add--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
it's
not
the
ball
game.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
materiality
isn't
the
only
element.
it's
not
a
divided
loyalties
issue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'll
--
i
agree,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
intend
to
answer
that
question,
but
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say,
for
me
that
by
acknowledging
that
something
can
be
material
if
the
employer
would
take
different
action
does
not
mean
that
everything
that
the
employee
does
is
a
crime.
the
employee
is
not
exercising
the
official
powers
of
his
office
or
job,
and
that
is
what
was
critical.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
is
still
not
exercising
the
powers
of
his
company,
he
is
off
on
a
frolic
and
detour.
what
the
pre-mcnally
cases
were
looking
at
were
agents
who--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
related
to
it,
justice
ginsburg,
in
that
in
a
business
setting
materiality
will
be
in
most
cases
coextensive
with
economic
harm
at
least
if
economic
harm
is
conceived
as
i
conceive
it,
and
as
the
cases
have
conceived
of
it
as
extending
to
things
like
harm
to
reputation
that
will
interfere
with
a
business's
ability
to
go
forward.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--fraud.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
--
the
first
line
of
response
to
this,
justice
scalia,
is
that
these
are
all
--
what
you
are
describing
are
all
money
or
property
frauds
that
could
be
charged
if
the
government
so
chose
so
long
as
the
mails
or
the
wires
were
involved.
the
mail
fraud
statute
doesn't
by
itself
carve
out
de
minimus
frauds.
the
concept
of
materiality,
though,
in
my
concept
of
the
divided
loyalties
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
honest
services
fraud,
includes
in
itself
the
concept
of
an
undisclosed
interest
that
is
important
in
some
way,
because
the
obligation
of
the
employee,
the
agent,
the
fiduciary,
the
company
executive,
the
politician
who
has
been
elected
to
office,
is
defined
by
a
bedrock
substratum
of
fiduciary
duties
that
are
universally
recognized
in
the
common
law,
that
were--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
there
is
no
bright
line
rule
just
based
on
economic
harm
versus
everything
else.
there
is
no
bright
line
rule
in
the
law
of
mail
fraud
in
these
issues
but
the
scope
of
the
duty
that
has
been
recognized
in
the
pre-mcnally
cases
had
to
do
with
the
conflicts
of
interest
produced
by
bribes,
produced
by
people
who
took
kickbacks,
produced
by
self-dealing
where
somebody
was
selling
his
own
product
to
the
company
but
not
disclosing
that
he
had
an
interest
in
the
company.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
it's
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
was
no
pre-mcnally
case
that
ever--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
by
moonlighting,
justice
breyer,
you
mean
somebody
who
has
a
business
on
the
side
and
in
dealing
with
his
own
company.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
that's
--
no,
no.
self-dealing
in
the
kind
that
i
am
talking
about
is
where
somebody
has
--
he
is
playing
the
role
of
loyal
corporate
employee,
loyal
corporate
officer,
but
he
is
actually
working
for
himself
by
buying
from
his
own
company,
without
disclosing
that
to
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
i
--
i'm
describing
for
you
are
the
core
cases,
so
that
this
court
can
put
a
definition
on
honest
services
fraud
that
would
be
familiar
to
the
lower
courts
which
have
had
this
body
of
case
law
ongoing
for
close
to
40
years
now
and
have
never
encountered
the
problems
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
real--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
the
theory
that
the
government
proposes
to
this
court,
which
involves
personal
conflicting
financial
interests,
that
the
agent
or
fiduciary
furthers
by
taking
official
action
provides
a
set
of
cases
that
subsumes
what
you're
interested
in,
justice
sotomayor,
and
provides
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
and
to
prosecutors
on
what
can
be
charged.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
your
son,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
adult
son
is
not
you,
personally,
no.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
the
--
the
core
of
the
pre-mcnally
cases
involve
personal
conflicting
financial
interest.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
petitioner
and
i
agree
that
congress
wrote
this
statute
with
the
use
of
the
phrase
"right
of
honest
services"
as
a
term
of
art,
in
order
to
refer
to
a
body
of
law
that
it
understood
had
a
consistent
core,
and
that
core--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
but
it,
in
fact,
did
have
one,
and
the
reason
that
it
had
one,
even
though
this
court
held
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
did
not
protect
the
deprivation
of
intangible
rights,
there
was,
nonetheless,
at
the
heart
of
the
pre-mcnally
cases,
a
substratum
of
a
universal
common
law
rule
of
fiduciary
duties
and
agency
that
has,
as
an
undisputed
and
not
at
all
vague
core,
that
agents
can't
engage
in
undisclosed
self-dealing.
they
can't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
ginsburg,
it's
when
the
same
person
is
on
two
sides
of
the
transaction,
so
you
have
in,
for
example,
this
case,
mr.
black
is
going
to
receive
compensation
from
his
company,
and
on
behalf
of
the
company,
he
is
authorizing
and
entering
into
alleged
noncompetition
agreements
that
recharacterize
the
money
or,
in
a
case
of
count
7,
i
think
justice
alito
is
absolutely
correct,
outright
steal
the
money.
he--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
right
refers,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
the
acknowledgment
that
there
was
a
common
law
fiduciary
duty
that
was
assimilated
into
the
law
of
fraud,
really,
beyond
dispute.
i
haven't
understood--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
it
certainly
is
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
congress
intended
to
basically
say
to
this
court,
you
have
determined
that
intangible
rights
are
not
protected
under
the
mail
fraud
statute.
only
money
or
property
is.
congress
desired
to
correct
the
statute
by
protecting
frauds
that
involve
intangible
rights,
and
it
did
that
by
using
a
term
of
art
that
was
replete
throughout
the
legislative
debates,
for
those
who
read
them,
as
referring
to
the
same
core
body
of
cases
that
we
rely
on
here.
and
those
cases
--
any
--
any
legal
rule
will
have
cases
at
the
margins,
in
which
reasonable
jurists
will
debate
whether--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
was
a
larger
body
of
public
sector
cases.
there
was
a
very
substantial
body
of
private
sector
cases,
many
of
which
were
cited
in
your
honor's
dissent
in
the
mcnally
case.
and
those
cases,
i
think,
as
mr.
--
the
chief
justice
indicated
earlier,
contained,
but
a
single
opinion,
the
lemire
opinion
from
the
d.c.
circuit,
that
talked
about
contemplated
economic
harm.
petitioner
seeks
to
assimilate
that,
somehow,
into
the
notion
of
an
intent
to
defraud
that
he
says
was
inherent
in
the
mail
fraud
statute
everywhere
and
always
before
mcnally.
but
if
he
seriously
believes
in
that
theory,
then
he
would
have
to
say
that
a
--
an
intangible
rights
defendant
would
have
to
contemplate
economic
harm,
foresee
economic
harm
in
any
intangible
rights
case,
which
would
knock
out,
immediately,
many
of
the
critical
pre-mcnally
public
official
cases,
in
which
a
legislator
takes
a
bribe
for
action
that
doesn't
implicate
the
pecuniary
interests
of
the
holder
or
the
fiduciary
duty
or
in
which
a
union
official
accepts
payment
for
someone
who
wants
to
apply
for
membership.
membership
fees
are
fixed.
it's
not
as
if
the
union
is
losing
money.
and
it's
really
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
passed
a
statute
to
say,
we
don't
want
this
law
to
be
limited
to
property
rights.
and
somehow,
through
the
back
door,
smuggle
in
the
same
test
of
contemplated
economic
harm.
what
the
right
way
to
handle
this
issue
is
--
is
to
look
at
it
under
the
rubric
of
materiality
because
materiality
is
flexible.
it
considers
what
the
rights
are
of
the
particular
fiduciary--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
the
point,
justice
breyer,
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
materiality
would
function
much
like
the
petitioner's
contemplated
economic
harm
requirement
in
private
sector,
private
enterprise
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
not
immediately,
because
there
needs
to
be
an
intent
to
defraud,
which
includes
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
finish.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--which
includes
knowledge
of
the
legal
duty
that
the
employee
is
violating
and
will
include
materiality.
and
these
are
the
issues
that
screen
conflicts
and
prosecutions
in
a
variety
of
public
corruption
type
cases,
and
across
the
board
economic
harm
requirement,
which
i
understood
today
petitioner
to
disavow
would
devastate
the
application
statute
in
its
core
areas
of
public
corruption
cases.
