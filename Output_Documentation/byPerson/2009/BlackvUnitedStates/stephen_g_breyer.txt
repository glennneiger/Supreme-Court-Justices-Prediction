justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
--
do
you
--
does
the
government
feel
that
it
hasn't
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
brief
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
might
this
come
up
in
the
skilling
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
to
say,
in
your
view
--
no,
i'm
just
--
i'm
cutting
into
you
because
i
don't
--
you
answered
it
once
you
said
that.
the
--
the
--
what
i
wonder
is,
does
the
government
feel,
in
order
to
have
a
full
opportunity
to
brief
constitutionality,
that
we
should
issue
an
order
saying:
please
brief
the
constitutionality?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
should
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
as
i
hear
that
--
i
am
exaggerating,
possibly,
but
i
think
every
agent
has
a
duty
of
loyalty
to
provide
loyal
and
honest
services
to
the
master,
master
agent.
every
worker
is
an
agent
of
his
master,
the
employer.
so
every
instance
in
which
a
worker
does
not
provide
honest
services
to
the
employer,
he
has
met
your
test.
i
think
there
are
300
--
perhaps
there
are
150
million
workers
in
the
united
states.
i
think
possibly
140
of
them
would
flunk
your
test.
[laughter]
i
mean,
that's
what
worrying
me.
now,
why?
because
--
i
--
"do
you
like
my
hat"?
says
the
boss.
"oh,
i
love
your
hat.
"
says
the
worker.
why?
so
the
boss
will
leave
the
room
so
that
the
worker
can
continue
to
read
the
racing
form.
deception?
designed
to
work
at
reading
the
racing
form
instead
of
doing
your
honest
work
and,
therefore,
violation?
now,
explain
to
me
how
your
test
does
not
--
and
i
think
you
can
probably
do
it;
i
just
don't
understand
it
at
the
moment.
explain
it
to
me,
how
your
test
does
not
make
this
statute
potentially
criminalizing
100
million
workers
in
the
united
states,
or
some
tens
of
millions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
this
--
i'm
just
getting
a
label,
and
as
i
hear
you
talk,
i
think
it's
not
what
you
necessarily
--
i
found
in
the
brief,
or
didn't
understand
it
from
the
brief
--
but
i
found
precisely
what
you
said,
it
seems
to
me
in
what
i
have
labeled
altshuler
alternative
b,
does
that
ring
a
bell?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
you've
read
the
briefs
--
you've
read
the
briefs.
he
has
alternative
a
and
alternative
b.
and
alternative
a
he
says
kickbacks,
and
it
could
be
limited
to
bribery
or
kickbacks.
in
alternative
b
he
adds
bribery,
kickbacks
and
undisclosed
self-dealing
capable
of
causing
economic
harm.
that's
what
i
got
out
of
the
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
i
just
heard
what
you
said
and
it
sounded
like
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
not
causing
economic
harm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
about
my
racing
form?
he
is
acting
for
himself
and
not
his
employer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
different
matter.
the
foolish
to
prosecute,
jury
defined,
worries
me
for
the
reason
that
what's
in
the
back
of
my
mind
--
and
you
will
see
what
--
i
am
disclosing
to
you
what
is
in
the
back
of
my
mind.
[laughter]
when
the
criminal
code
was
reenacted
and
never
was,
one
kind
of
joke
was
that
it
there
it
would
be
--
there
would
one
law,
the
law
would
be
read
as
a
crime
to
do
wrong,
okay?
"it
is
a
crime
to
do
wrong.
"
sometimes
adding,
"in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
"
all
right.
now
you
see
the
problem?
it
may
be
you
would
never
prosecute
it.
it
may
be
a
jury
would
never
convict.
but
that
isn't
the
basis
for
having
a
statute
that
picks
up
80
or
100
million
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
--
that
is
altshuler
b,
which
i
--
that
seems
to
work,
but
then
you
want
to
go
beyond
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
think
in
going
beyond
that
is
the
paradigm
case
of
--
of
moonlighting?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no,
no.
i'm
trying
to
get
--
encapsulate
your
test
in
my
mind.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
a
way,
so
as
i
listen
to
you,
i
think
what
you
are
driving
at
--
a
paradigm
case
of
what
you
are
driving
at
would
be
moonlighting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
--
no
--
yes.
he
takes
a
day
--
he
leaves
an
hour
early
because
he
is
selling
real
estate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to
have
all
those
elements?
one
--
i
mean,
everybody
is
working
for
the
company.
everybody
has
loyalty
to
the
company
owner.
and,
now,
you
are
saying
everybody
has
competing
things
that
they
sort
of
like
to
do,
which
would
deprive
the
owner
of
the
honest
services,
but
you
are
saying,
in
addition
to
that,
he
has
to
have
his
own
company?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
addition
to
that,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
materiality
just
has
to
do
with
whether
a
false
statement
you
make,
in
fact,
causes
the
effect,
or
is
likely
to,
that
is
the
harmful
effect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
always
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
and
the
--
and
the
reason
i
say
with
--
maybe
i
have
the
example
that
i
mean
now.
in
the
cases
you
just
mention,
the
bribe
case?
right,
the
legislature
is
not
going
to
gain.
the
legislator
or
the
briber
might,
but
somebody
will.
and
the
object
of
those
bribes
was
that
there
would
be
economic
gain,
and
that
was
what
--
when
i
went
through
all
those
mcnally
cases,
i
thought
i
could
fit
them
into
this
alternative
altshuler
thing,
but
now,
you
--
you
worry
me
that
you
have
a
different
test
that
will
bring
in
like
any
failure
to
fill
out
a
disclosure
form.
a
deliberate
failure
to
answer
a
box,
one
out
of
1,000,
for
every
government
employee,
would
immediately
--
20
years
in
jail.
