are
--
are
you
saying
that
unless
we
adopt
the
limiting
instruction
that
you
propose,
the
statute
is
then
vague?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
while
we
are
on
the
oeschler
thing,
and
then
you'll
probably
want
to
go
on
to
the
other
thing.
assume
this
trial
were
held
again.
the
government
said:
all
the
same
evidence
--
same
evidence.
would
that
evidence
suffice
for
an
instruction
to
the
jury?
could
the
case
go
to
the
jury
under
the
oeschler
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
kickback
or
bribe.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
the
test
that
you
propose,
is
the
test
the
same?
does
the
statute
read
the
same
way,
and
is
the
test
the
same
for
private
and
public
officials?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
we
--
then
if
we
accept
your
view,
we
have
to
have
one
subset
of
definitions
for
private
officials
and
another
for
public
officials.
it's
hard
to
do
that
under
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
the
judge's
bribery
case
that
we
just
--
that
you
discussed
earlier,
couldn't
you
take
the
position
that
that
money
the
judge
took
as
a
bribe
really
should
have
been
paid
to
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
would
fit
your
test,
though.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
a
little
--
it's
a
little
odd
that
you
--
you
would
say
that
an
argument
that
shows
a
way
the
statute
can
be
saved
cannot
be
--
cannot
be
presented.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
he's
saying
the
statute
could
be
saved,
if
at
all,
if
you
adopt
this
--
this
construction.
and
if
you
do,
his
--
his
conviction
must
be
set
aside.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
just
can't
find
a
--
a
grounding
in
the
statute
for
it,
then
that's
because
the
statute's
vague.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
the
employee
would
be
fired
if
defalcation
had
come
to
light,
that's
material?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
that's
the
ball
game.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
that's
the
ball
game.
hypo:
you
go
to
the
ball
game,
the
government--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
employer
finds
out
about
it,
he
fires
--
so
it's
material
because
you
would
be
fired
for
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
about
just
materiality.
just
materiality
would
be
satisfied.
you
said
that
if
the
employer
would
fire,
that
is
material.
and
then
we
had
the
ball
game
hypothetical.
then
you
said
oh,
well,
and
then
some
other
thing.
but
we
are
talking
just
about
materiality
so
you
should
stick
with
that
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
drives
to
the
ball
game
in
the
government
--
in
the
company
car.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
336.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
said
honest
services
include
fiduciary
duties
under
corporate.
