justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
what's
so
discretionary
and
harmful
about
a
bribery
or
kickback
case.
let's
take
just
the
limiting
principle
of
the
trunk.
whether
it's
in
the
private
or
the
public
sector,
why
would,
offering,
there
be
any
discretion
or
any
sense
of
vagueness
about
saying:
it's
illegal
to
give
a
bribery?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
get
a
contract,
to
pass
legislation,
it's
illegal
to
take
a
kickback.
there
is
nothing
seemingly
vague
about
that
or
seemingly
troublesome
about
prosecutorial
discretion
in
those
--
at
least
those
two
situations.
we
could
then
go
to
the
self-dealing
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--does
skilling
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
directly
answer
this
question:
does
skilling
present
the
pure
question
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
don't
know
if
that's
going
to
be--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--then
what's
the
source
--
and
i
think
that's
inherent
in
the
chief
justice's
question
--
what
is
it
--
where
did
he
draw
the
line
and
where
do
we
go
to
look
to
where
you
draw
the
line
on
what
information
needs
to
be
disclosed?
because
if
it's
not
a
niece,
my
best
friend
is
going
to
get
a
1.4
million
on
this
deal.
where
is
the
line
drawn,
and
what
is
the
source
of
the
law
that
we
look
to
to
figure
out
where
to
draw
that
line?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
talking
about
private
gain?
do
i
gain
something
as
opposed
to
--
because
that
--
i
know
that
is
the
skilling
case.
but
if--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no,
but
that's
--
you
have
to,
because
you
have
to
tell
us
what
draws
--
you
have
to
give
us
the
source
or
some
source
of
limiting,
of
limitation.
and
that's
what
justice
breyer
has
been
talking
about.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
defined
how?
that's
what
i'm
--
i'm
trying
--
material
in
what
way?
because
if
you
don't
how
by
an
economic
loss
to
the
victim
or
by
private
gain
to
the
--
to
the
perpetrator,
then
you
are
left
with
what
substance
to
the
issue
of
materiality?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
becomes
important?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
the
--
for
an
auditor
on
april
14th
his
guy
--
or
april
1st
his
employee
goes
off
to
a
ball
game?
it
could
be
a
huge
economic
loss
to
that
employer
by
that
employee's
decision
at
that
particular
moment
to
go
to
a
baseball
game
as
opposed
to
working.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
second
circuit
said
economic
loss--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
there
has
to
be
the
risk
of
economic
loss--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
the
private
sector.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
is
the
problem
the
nondisclosure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
is
the
problem
the
--
the
self-dealing
itself,
the
fact
that
the
person
is
receiving
a
gain?
there's
where
i'm
trying
to
draw
the
line
because
i
keep
going
back
to
--
what
is
the
source
of
information
that
would
put
a
limitation
on
how
much
you
disclose
or
don't
disclose?
it
has
to
be
--
the
issue
has
to
be
looked
at
differently,
which
is
the
evil
is
the
self-dealing,
the
gain
the
person's
receiving.
i
know,
you
don't
want
me
to
go
there
because
of
skilling,
but
i'm
troubled
because
the
issue
of
disclosure
creates
a
federal
common
law
of
what's
important
to
tell
either
the
public
or
a
private
employer?
and
i
don't
know
how
to
define
that
issue
of
importance--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--other
than
to
say
that
it's
a
gain
that
the
individual's
receiving
or
something
the
individual's
doing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
you're--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
know
you
are
running
out
of
time,
but
you
are
speaking
so
fast
i
can't
even
follow
you
anymore.
