well,
since
the
--
since
the
body
of
pre-mcnally
lower
court
cases
was
hardly
completely
consistent,
do
you
think
this
is
a
workable
approach?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
just
take
a
moment
and
explain
why
any
error
in
the
honest
services
instruction
wasn't
harmless
as
applied
to
the
forum/paxton
transaction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
evidence
there
that
the
$600,000
was
a
--
a
recharacterized
management
fee;
isn't
that
correct?
