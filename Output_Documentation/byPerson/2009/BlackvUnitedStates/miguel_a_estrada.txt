mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
two
decades,
courts
of
appeals
confronting
section
1346
have
been
unanimous
on,
at
most,
three
points.
the
first
one
is
that
the
unvarnished
text
of
the
statute
is
vague,
amorphous,
open-ended,
and
essentially,
not
very
helpful.
the
second
one
is
that
a
meaningful
attempt
to
construe
the
statute
can
take
place,
if
at
all,
only
in
light
of
a
body
of
law
that
this
court
rejected
in
mcnally
and
congress
likely
intended
to
restore
in
the
act.
and
the
third
is
that
this
exercise
is
fraught
with
due
process
and
federalism
problems
and
risks
the
creation
of
common
law
crimes,
especially
in
the
private
sector
where
the
pre-mcnally
precedent
was
not
well-developed.
the
principal
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
prosecution
may
be
sustained
under
a
1346
theory,
under
a
theory
that
was
not
successful
before
mcnally
and,
in
fact,
had
been
affirmatively
rejected,
even
in
the
heyday
of
the
intangible
rights
doctrine.
because
the
answer
to
that
question
is
"no",
all
convictions
in
this
case
must
be
reversed.
it
would
be
well
to
start
by
acknowledging
that
the
root
difficulty
in
this
case
is
that
this
court
asked
congress
to
speak
clearly,
and
congress
did
not
do
that.
as
a
result,
there
is
no
solution
that
is
really
capable
of
providing
an
--
an
elegant
out
to
the
morass
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
confronting,
but
the
choices,
essentially,
fall
on
three
categories.
and
the
first
is
to
return
the
matter
to
congress,
either
because
the
statute
is
vague
in
all
of
its
applications,
both
public
or
private,
or
as
to
private
conduct,
because
there
are
not
enough
guideposts
for
judicial
decision-making
to
give
meaning
to
the
statute.
the
second
category
of
choices--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
we
do.
i
mean,
we
--
we
have
--
we
have
written
a
question
that
necessarily
has
that
as
a
predicate,
which,
under
this
court's
cases,
leave
that
predicate
open
to
the
court.
we
have
an--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
have
argued
that.
it
is
also
--
you
know,
just
to
--
just
to
finish
painting
the
picture,
justice
kennedy,
we
have
--
we
have
the
trunk
of
a
tree,
and
that's
--
you
know,
the
statute,
is
it
vague
or
isn't?
then
we
have
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
limiting
construction,
and
professor
altshuler,
for
example,
has
made
a
case
that
limiting
the
statute
to
bribes
and
kickbacks
is
a
possibility,
as
that
being,
arguably,
the
only
core
conduct
that
congress
could
have
contemplated.
and
--
and
the
third
one
is
to
go
beyond
bribes
and
--
and
kickbacks,
and
to
expand
the
statute
to
what
congress
likes
to
call
self-dealing
or
non-disclosure,
which
is
really
a
wholesale
takeover
of
state
commercial
law.
in
our
view,
if
the
court
is
disposed
to
reach
that
far
into
the
third
category,
it
is
essential
that
the
restrictions
that
had
been
recognized
before
mcnally
be
enforced
against
--
against
the
government,
but
we
have
briefed
the
case
in
the
way
we
have
to
this
--
basically
assuming
that
this
tree
is
not
imaginary
and
actually
exists--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
that
is
not
a
fair
statement,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion,
of
course,
is
indeed
very
helpful,
but
it
was
a
--
a
distillation
of
what
other
courts
of
appeals
have
told
the
government
again
and
again,
in
ballard
in
the
fifth
circuit,
in
feldman
in
the
seventh,
in--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
it
had
a
different
view,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
when
they
filed
the
brief
in
the
carpenter
case.
but
the
fact
is,
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
can
be
judged
by
what
the
contemporaneous
cases
were.
and
von
barta,
dixon,
all
cases
in
the
second
circuit,
feldman
in
the
seventh,
ballard,
all
had
indicated
that
this
was
a
requirement
of
the
theory
in
intangible
rights
cases.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
honest
answer
is:
i
do
believe
that
the
statute
is
vague
in
all
of
its
--
all
of
its
applications,
and
i
am
happy
to
explain,
quickly,
because
of
that,
why
that
is.
obviously,
there
are
obvious
problems
of
notice
with
the
statute.
the
more
fundamental
problem
with
the
statute,
as
if
the
notice
problems
were
not
enough,
is
in
the
second
prong
of
the
vagueness
doctrine,
which
is
the
conferral
of
discretion
to
select
the
defendant
on
the
government,
and
in
particular,
the
prosecutors.
and
this
is
a
situation
not
unlike
that
as
was
outlined
by
justice
breyer's
concurring
opinion
in
the
morales
case.
and
what
he
pointed
out,
pointing
to
cases
like
coates
v.
city
of
cincinnati,
was
that
a
statute
that
essentially
confers
discretion
on
the
--
on
the
police
and
the
prosecutors
to
select
the
quarry
and
come
up
with
that
appropriate
justification
to
sell
to
the
court
later--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
absolutely
agree
with
the
statements
that
you
made,
justice
sotomayor.
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
a
--
that
a
statute
that
proscribes
bribery
or
kickbacks
can
constitutionally
be
written,
if
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
that
is
not
a
fair
statement,
justice
ginsburg,
because
in
our
economic
system,
i
think
it
is
fairly
inferable,
and
any
jury
could
so
find
that
if
you
are
a
supply
agent
for
a
corporation
and
you
are
taking
a
bribe
of
$10,000
to
steer
the
contract
to
company
x,
company
x
would
be
more
than
happy,
and
it
would
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
company
x
to
just
give
a
10k
break
to
your
employer.
so
it
is
inherent
in
the
economic
system
in
the
private
sector
that
if
you're
talking
about
bribes
and
kickbacks,
there
is
an
obvious,
though
perhaps
not
fully
quantifiable,
risk
of
loss
to
the
person
to
whom
the
duty
is
owed.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think,
justice
scalia--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
and
that
was
going
to
be
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
justice
sotomayor,
and
it
is
a
point
that
justice
breyer
also
made
in
the
morales
case,
taking
--
taking
the
example
of
coates
v.
city
of
cincinnati
where
the
law
basically
said,
"you
shall
not
engage
in
annoying
conduct.
"
now,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
many
of
us
would
agree
100
out
of
100
that
certain
things
are
definitely
annoying.
and
the
fact
that
you
could
find,
for
example,
that
an
assault
is
annoying
does
not
mean
that
this
statute
gives
notice
that
--
that,
you
know,
your
conduct
is
--
is
within
its
written
terms--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
think
that
sort
of
self-dealing
likely
would
be
covered,
not
under
my
view
of
the
statute,
but
under
carpenter,
because
if
you
were
stealing
confidential
information
from
your
employer,
and
the
court
in
carpenter
did
say
that
confidential
information
is
a
--
is
a
form
of
property
as
a
matter
of
federal
law--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--but
under
either
view,
if
you
are
going
to
steal
the
corporate
opportunity,
that,
too,
is
a
form
of
property,
and
in
fact,
the
property
counts
in
this
very--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--precisely,
but
--
but
this
is
not
unlike
cases
like
o'hagan,
or
even
carpenter
itself,
in
which,
you
know,
the
value
of
the
use
of
the
information
comes
from
learning
the
confidential
plans
of
your
employer.
and
in
those
circumstances,
carpenter
said
that
the
information
itself
could
be
a
form
of
intangible
property.
and
so
that
is
a
different
problem
than
a
native
duty
violation,
which
is
what
we
are
dealing
here.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
under
the
obstruction,
or
--
i
mean,
under
the
--
under
the
kickback--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
it
couldn't.
i
mean,
part
of
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
is
that
under
any
of
these
choices,
whether
the
statute
is
vague
or
unapplicable
to
private
conduct,
choice
one,
or
whether
it
is
a
kickback
or
bribe,
choice
two,
there
would
not
be
a
case
to
send
to
the
jury
for
the
defendants
in
this
case.
the
only
argument
comes
up
if
you
really
want
to
climb
to
the
thinnest
reed
of
the
thinnest
branch
and
say
that
it
could
extend
to
naked
non-disclosure
of
confidential
information
or
use
of
confidential
information
in
violation
of
a
duty
imposed
by
contract
or
state
law,
or
maybe
even
a
consent
decree,
as
in
sorich.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
i
can
give
an
answer
that
would
be
fully
satisfactory
to
a
pure
textualist,
that
this
can
be
taken
out
of
the
words
of
the
statute.
as
a
practical
matter,
however,
if
you
consider
the
legislative
record,
and
the
avowing
hint
to
restore
some
part
of
what
mcnally
had
thrown
out,
then
a
harder
question
comes
up,
and
the
issue
of
what
that
was
actually
becomes
highly
relevant.
but
i
do
not
think
that,
even
under
the
textualist
view,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
congress
went
in
the
private
sector
from
a
view
of
fraud
that
is
--
that
was
classically
property
kind
to
a
view
of
fraud
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
property.
and
the
reason
for
that
takes
understanding
what
--
what
the
problem
really
was
that
congress
was
trying
to
fix,
and
that
the
intangible
rights
cases
were
trying
to
fix.
and
it's
really
one
of
symmetry.
it
has
always
been
the
case
that
mail
fraud
is
a
specific
intent
crime.
and
it
has
always
been
the
case,
and
this
is
clearly
stated
in
cases
like
regent
office
supply
and
dixon,
from
judge
friendly,
that
a
part
of
the
specific
intent
to
defraud
is
an
intent
to
harm.
now,
in
classic
fraud,
the
defendant
intends
to
harm
the
victim
by
obtaining,
in
a
corrupt
manner,
his
property.
so
there
is
a
perfect
symmetry
between
the
intended
harm
to
the
victim
and
the
expected
gain
of
the
defendant,
because
the
gain
comes
from
the
victim's
pocket.
the
problem
of
bribes
and
kickbacks
that
the
intangible
rights
cases
were
trying
to
deal
with
is
not
that
they
were
trying
to
dispense
with
the
harm's
requirement
to
the
victim;
they
were
trying
to
deal
with
the
lack
of
symmetry
where
the
person
given
the
payoff
is
not
deceived
and
the
harm
to
the
victim
is
non-quantifiable.
and
to
fix
that
problem,
you
could
say
that
this
statute
could
then
say
that
the
term
of
art,
as
the
government
calls
it,
that
congress
used
was
intended
to
cover
that
situation.
now,
the
proof
in
the
pudding
on
that
comes
from
a
very
well-known
case.
let's
take,
you
know,
the
holzer
case,
which
was
cited
extensively
by
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
in
mcnally.
you
may
recall
it
was
a
state
court
judge
who
had
been
taking
bribes,
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
in
an
opinion
by
judge
posner,
which
he
cited
in
this
case
again,
which
appears,
i
think,
at
816
f.
2d,
and
it
was
just
a
straight
intangible
rights
affirmment.
he
sought
cert,
you
know,
judge
holzer
did,
and
he
got
a
gvr
in
light
of
mcnally.
and
judge
posner
got
the
case
back.
judge
holzer
goes
back
and
there
is
a
second
opinion,
840
f.
2d,
and
judge
posner
has
to
conclude
that
judge
holzer
has
to
be
let
go
on
the
mail
fraud
counts.
and
the
reason
he
gives
is:
look,
the
judge
obviously
got
lots
of
money,
but
he
didn't
get
the
money
from
anybody
who
was
deceived,
and
all
of
his
victims,
which
were
the
public
and
the
litigants
against
whom
the
cases
were
fixed,
those
people
didn't
lose
any
money,
so
that
under
the
mcnally
paradigm,
because
the
money
that
judge
holzer
got
in
bribes
did
not
come
from
the
victims,
that
--
that
judge
had
to
be
let
go.
and
i
think
that
that's
part
of
what
congress
clearly
had
in
mind
as
was
trying
to
fix.
now,
i
agree
with
your
--
with
your
apparent
antecedent
view
and
what
i
call
issue
one
in
the
case,
that
the
way
that
congress
did
it
has
been
one
of
not
complying
with
the
request
that
this
court
made.
it
did
not
make
anything
clear
in
a
way
that
sets
forth
in
the
text
what
it
does.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
there
are
any
--
there
are
any
number
of
problems
with
how
congress
chose
to
do
this,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
actually
the
tip
of
the
iceberg,
because
if
you
look
as
a
textual
matter
to
the
first
words
of
section
1346,
you
will
see
that
this
new
amended
definition
of
63
of
title
18.
there
are
11
of
those.
and
in
addition
to
mail
and
wire
fraud,
at
least
three
of
them
--
bank
fraud,
securities
fraud,
and
healthcare
fraud
--
used
the
phrase
"scheme
to
defraud".
and
unless
you
are
prepared
to
try
to
save
the
statute
by
--
by
trying
to
identify
a
core
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
that
is
squarely
anchored
in
the
pre-mcnally
law,
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
successful
enterprise,
you
do
not
have
any
textual
guidance
that
will
tell
you
whether
this
theory
that
the
government
likes
to
state
at
a
very
high
level
of
generality
would
not
become
a
deus
ex
machina
in
a
number
of
other
statutes
that
we
have
yet
to
--
to
hear
from.
and
that
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--then
it--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--you
should
not.
and
in
that
event,
we
fully
support
--
actually,
we
support
anyway
--
the
--
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers,
for
the
proposition
that
as
an
essential
matter,
this
statute
cannot
be
saved.
i
am
merely
pointing
out,
justice
scalia,
that
for
somebody
who
is
not
a
textualist,
that
question
may
not
be
as
clear-cut.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
made
it
--
we
made
it
in
the
district
court
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
and
i
don't
believe
that
is
part
of
the
joint
appendix,
but
it
is
docket
entry
261.
and
in
that
same
motion,
we
argued
that
this
statute,
if
it
were
to
be
applied
at
all,
had
to
be
interpreted
solely
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
which
oddly
enough,
is
the
position
that
the
government
has
finally
now
taken
in
the
weyhrauch
case.
and
we
argued
based
on
the
jerome
case
and
cleveland
case,
which
are
the
cases
that
the
government
has
finally
discovered.
we
argued
again
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
argued
expressly
that
although
the
seventh
circuit
had
--
had
previously
indicated
that
it
would
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
against
a
vagueness
challenge,
that
judge
easterbrook,
writing
for
the
court
in
thompson,
had
left
open
the
possibility
that
they
may
yet
find
a
case
in
which
that
would
be
revisited.
and
we
expressly
argued
that
this
was
the
case
for
which
thompson
had
left
the
--
the
question
open.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
a
problem
that
is
inherent,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
trying
to
do
anything
to
save
the
statute.
but
let
me
say--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
oddly
enough,
that
was
an
argument
that
was
made
to
judge
posner
and
remanded,
the
holzer
case,
and
judge
posner
said,
well,
that
is
really
untenable.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
yes,
in
a
--
in
a
very
formal
way.
but
--
but
if
i
could
say
just
one
word
on
the
question
of
the
public
v.
private
distinction,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
think
it
is
important,
in
trying
to
figure
out
how
one
goes
about
trying
to
fix
what
is
basically
a
mess,
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
courts
had
accepted
the
intangible
rights
theory
before
mcnally,
and
which
congress
presumably
and
--
or
likely
was
trying
to
bring
back,
had
--
had
not
taken
the
view
that
they
were
doing
something
other
than
fraud.
but
they
have
taken
the
view
that
there
was
a
basis
in
the
concept
of
fraud
for
distinguishing
between
the
public
and
the
private,
even
before
mcnally.
and
some
of
this
--
this
is
found
in
the
briefing
in
mcnally
and
is
set
forth
in
justice
stevens's
dissenting
opinion,
that
there
was
this
other
statute,
section
371
of
18
u.s.c.,
the
conspiracy
statute,
that
uses
the
phrase
"conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states.
"
and
on
the
basis
of
that
statute,
before
mcnally,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
--
have
ruled
that
an
intent
to
interfere
with
the
property
rights
of
the
government
was
not
an
element
of
the
core
meaning
of
the
fraud.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
since
1905,
in
a
case
called
hask
v.
henfold,
and
followed
later
by
a
case
called
hammerschmidt,
this
court
had
said
that
in
order
to
be
convicted
of
defrauding
the
government
under
this
other
statute,
no
need
--
there
was
no
need
to
show
that
the
government's
property
interests
were
--
were
interfered
with
solely--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
--
we
raised
that
as
a
predicate
for
our
question
presented.
and
we
said
this
is
vague,
but
--
but
if
--
but
if
you
do
not
accept
this
proposed
restriction
that
has
been
accepted
by
the
--
by
the
courts
of
appeals,
then
you
would
really
have
to
take
the
--
take
the
step
of
actually
striking
it
down.
if
you
are
asking
whether
we
tendered
it
as
a
separate
question
presented,
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
under
this
court's
cases
that
is
not
needed.
and
the
cases
that
i
would
direct
the
--
the
court
to
for
that
proposition
are
--
some
of
them
are
cited
in
the
chambers
brief.
and
the
first
one
is
u.s.
v.
grubbs,
where
this
court
said
that
in
a
case
involving
the
technical
sufficiency
of
a
search
warrant
it
was,
of
course,
open
to
the
court
to
consider
whether
the
particular
type
of
warrant,
an
anticipatory
search
warrant,
was
categorically
improper
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
--
because,
as
the
court
explained,
it
was
an
antecedent
question
that
was
a
predicate
for
a
logical
disposition
of
the
actual
question
in
front
of
the
court.
in
doing
that
--
that,
by
the
way,
was
a
unanimous
opinion
by
justice
scalia.
in
doing
that,
you
know,
the
court
cited
to
the
case
of
wilkinson
v.
austin,
which
was
another
unanimous
opinion,
this
time
by
justice
kennedy.
in
that
case
the
issue
on
which
cert
had
been
granted
was
the
--
the
question
of
what
process
was
due
to
a
--
to
a
prisoner
in
state
custody.
and
the
state
of
ohio,
that
case
had
affirmatively
conceded
that
there
was
a
liberty
interest
and
that
the
suggestion
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
--
the
court
concluded
that
whether
or
not
there
was
even
a
liberty
interest
was
an
antecedent
question
and
was
a
logical
predicate
for
--
for
the
intelligent
consideration.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
--
that's
count
seven?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
the
argument
on
that,
justice
alito,
was
entirely
different.
the
--
the
record
does
show
that
the
executive
committee
of
hollinger
and
the
full
board
unanimously,
including
every
member
of
the
audit
committee,
had
approved
the
execution
of
the
noncompetes
with
paxton
and
--
and
forum.
and
the
only
other
evidence
as
to
why
they
were
not
in
fact
executed
as
contemplated
by
the
board
resolutions
was
radler's
testimony
that
kipnis
simply
forgot.
now,
significantly,
after
the
jury
came
back
and
found
all
three
of
the
defendants
guilty
on
that
count,
judge
sansieve
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal
for
kipnis
on
count
seven,
finding
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
as
to
him.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
just
a
few
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
it
bear
emphasis
that
the
government
has
once
again
said
that
this
is
a
federal
obligation.
this
entire
case
was
tried
based
on
talmudic
debates
of
the
ins
and
outs
of
section
144
of
the
delaware
law
of
corporations.
we
had
motions
to
dismiss,
we
had
briefing.
the
jury
was
given
detailed
instructions,
and
this
goes
to
all
of
the
fraud
counts,
justice
alito.
you
cannot
say
that
you
can
uphold
something
as
harmless
when
the
entire
theory
on
which
the
case
was
tried
actually
has
been
changed
at
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
relatedly,
i
would
like
to
add,
because
the
government
said
that
count
seven
was
a
theft,
that
the
government's
theory
on
count
seven
was
that
the
noncompetes
were
frauds
from
their
inception,
because
the
reps
from
paxton
and
forum,
none
was
wanted.
and
in
fact,
other
counts
that
charged
forum
and
paxton,
two
and
three,
you
know,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
and
as
did
judge
sansieve
on
kipnis
on
seven.
and
that
makes
it
highly
likely
that
--
that
the
jury
convicted
based
on
the
government
's
argument,
that
even
though
every
single
member
of
the
audit
committee
approved
the
noncompetes
as
a
member
of
the
board,
that
delaware
law
required
a
separate
and
prior
application
to
the
audit
committee.
and
if
that's
what
the
jury
was
told,
you
cannot
really
say
that
count
seven
is
separate.
second--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
the
jury
was
told
--
let
me
find
that,
i
think
it's
around
page
336.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yeah,
336
and
337,
and
the
jury
was
given
detailed
instructions
as
to
how
all
this
turned
on
whether
the
transactions
at
issue
were,
quote,
entirely
fair
under
delaware
law.
and
the
jury
was
further
told--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--correct.
and
then
you
then
went
to
say
that
--
that,
you
know,
delaware
was
controlling
--
this
is
the
middle
of
page
336
a
--
under
delaware
law,
a
corporation's
officers
have
these
duties,
one
of
them
is
loyalty.
loyalty
requires
this
and
such
under
delaware
law.
one
of
the
things
that
--
that
would
allow
the
jury
to
convict
was
the
notion
that
the
government
in
entirely
just
has
odds
for
understandable
reasons,
but
this
was
not
entirely
fair.
and
a
transaction
could
fail
to
be
entirely
fair
if
every
disclosure
that
should
have
been
made
in
accordance
with
delaware
law
was
not
made.
on
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
the
question
of
whether
we
are
really
embarking
on
the
federal
common
law
of
materiality.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
apologize,
your
honor.
the
second
question
i
wanted
to
address
is
a
question
that
you
raised,
justice
sotomayor,
it
is
false
to
say
that
the
materiality
is
a
filter.
criminal
law,
just
as
a
question
of
doctrine,
has
always
looked
at
the
mens
rea,
as
the
filter
that
takes
out
the
culpable
from
the
nonculpable.
in
this
case,
you
know,
the
so-called
filter
is
elusory.
if
you
have
a
money
or
property
case
--
your
honor,
may
i
finish?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--you
know
what
the
decision
is
that
you
are
supposing
to
induce,
whether
you
--
whether
the
person
would
part
with
the
money.
here
the
but-for
world,
was
the
decision
that
the
employer
might
make,
do
i
dock
his
pay;
do
i
give
him
a
demotion;
do
i
fire
him
for
all
purposes,
or
do
i
simply
say,
that
i
would
not
have
authorized
him
to
be
absent
at
all
for
the
ball
game.
none
of
those
things
is
specified,
and
the
entire
test
of
the
filter
is
as
vague
as
the
statute.
