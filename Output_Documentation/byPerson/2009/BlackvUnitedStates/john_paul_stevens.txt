justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
can
i
ask
this?
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
there
is
some
economic
harm
amounting
to
the
cost
of
a
world
series
ticket,
that's
all
--
or
the
amount
of
gas
used
to
drive
to
the
ballpark,
that
could
still
not
meet
the
materiality
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
i
should
know
this,
but
refresh
my
memory.
the
body
of
pre-mcnally
court
of
appeals
cases,
to
what
extent
were
they
just
public
rights
versus
private?
was
there
a
substantial
body?
