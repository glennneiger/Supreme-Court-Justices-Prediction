justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
your
--
it's
not
within
your
test,
as
i
understand
it.
your
test
is,
there
has
to
be
economic
harm
to
the
person
owed
the
duty
of
loyalty.
now,
you
could
have
a
bribe
or
a
kickback
that
will
line
the
pockets
of
the
person
who
takes
it,
doesn't
deceive
the
person
who
is
giving
it,
and
doesn't
harm
the
company
to
whom
a
duty
of
loyalty
is
owed.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
bribe
and
kickback,
which
i
think
is
heartland
mcnally,
would
not
be
included
in
yours.
it
must
be
economic
harm,
actual
or
contemplated,
to
the
person
owed
the
duty
of
loyalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
it
have
been
a
term
of
art
when
the
courts
--
the
lower
courts
were
massively
confused?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
wasn't
even
a
uniform
terminology
in
the
lower
courts.
they
didn't
all
use--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--excuse
me,
may
i
ask
you
to
put
--
in
terms
of
your
brief,
you
said
your
definition
of
materiality
--
you
said
materiality
is
related
to
but
different
from
what
mr.
estrada
is
urging
the
court
to
adopt:
economic
harm
to
the
victim.
so
can
you
tell
us
how
materiality
is
related
to
economic
harm
to
the
victim
and
how
it
is
different
from
economic
harm
to
the
victim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
kickbacks
and
--
and
bribes
is
clear.
sometimes,
the
government
just
talks
about
conflict
of
interest.
sometimes,
it
says,
"taking
action
under
conflict
of
interest.
"
well,
action
is
quite
broad.
and
that's
--
what
do
you
include
concretely
within
this
self-dealing
category?
taking
or
taking
action
on
the
basis
of
undisclosed
information?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
was
that
in
the
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
charge
--
the
judge
charged
the
jury
in
terms
of
delaware
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
next
announce
the
decision
in
number
08-876,
black
versus
united
states.
as
in
skilling
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
charged
with
fraud.
at
trial
the
government
pursued
alternative
theories,
money
or
property
fraud
and
honest-services-fraud.
the
government
sought
to
pinpoint
the
theory
or
theories
on
which
the
jury
relied
in
the
event
of
a
conviction.
to
that
purpose
the
government
proposed
special
verdict
forms
asking
the
jury
to
say
whether
the
verdict
rested
on
money
or
property
fraud
or
honest-services-fraud
or
both.
the
defendants
resisted
and
the
government
ultimately
acquiesced
in
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury
for
an
unelaborated
general
verdict.
on
appeal
the
defendants
urged
the
invalidity
of
the
honest-services-fraud
instructions.
the
seventh
circuit
found
no
infirmity
in
those
instructions
but
went
on
to
move
that
in
any
event
the
defendants
had
forfeited
their
objection
to
the
instructions.
defendants
did
show
the
court
of
appeal
said
by
opposing
the
government
proposed
special
verdict
forms
which
would
have
revealed
whether
the
jury
found
honest-services-fraud
or
only
money
or
property
fraud.
we
reverse
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
under
our
decision
today
in
skilling;
the
honest-services
instructions
given
to
the
jury
in
this
case
were
incorrect.
by
timely
objecting
to
those
instructions
at
trial,
the
defendants
secure
their
right
to
challenge
them
on
appeal.
the
defendants
did
not
forfeit
that
right
by
declining
to
acquiesce
in
the
government
proposed
special
verdict
forms.
as
in
skilling
however,
we
leave
for
consideration
on
remand,
the
question
whether
the
instructional
error
was
ultimately
harmless.
