you
--
you
don't
ask
for
the
first,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
with
the
bribe
or
kickback
explanation,
unlike
--
or
you
contend,
unlike
yours,
is
that
there's
no
basis
in
the
statute
for
limiting
it
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
--
we
can't
find
a
statute
that
says,
"no
person
shall
commit
a
bad
act.
"
we
can't
find
that
to
be
non-vague
as
applied
to
murder.
everybody
knows
that
murder
is
a
bad
act.
would
that
--
would
that
law
be
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
estrada,
let
--
let
me
pursue
the
notion
i
--
i
floated
earlier,
that
the
problem
with
professor
altshuler's
approach
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
would
enable
you
to
limit
it
to
kickbacks
and
--
and
bribes.
is
there
anything
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
makes
your
proposal
any
better?
i
mean,
to
be
sure,
it
does
--
it
does
make
this
a
kind
of
fraud,
and
in
the
past,
fraud
did
require
injury
to
somebody.
but
it
defined
a
new
kind
of
fraud,
namely,
fraud
that
consists
of
the
deprivation
of
honest
services.
that's
the
fraud.
that,
in
and
of
itself,
under
the
text
of
the
statute,
i
take
to
be
the
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
--
what
if
i
think
that
even
--
i
mean,
much
of
your
case
is
directed
to
the
point
that
you
--
you
have
to
narrow
it
this
way
to
avoid
constitutional
problems.
what
if
i
think
you
don't
avoid
constitutional
problems?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
--
why
should
i
turn
somersaults
to
--
to
come
out
with
the
--
with
the
interpretation
that
you
want?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
the
heart
to
inquire
into
that
question
if
i
think
that
the
whole
statute
is
bad.
and
that's
the
point
he
is
raising,
that
it's
--
it's
a
predicate
to
our
considering
that
question,
that
if
you
agree
with
him,
you
think
the
statute
will
be
sustained.
but
if
i
think
the
whole
statute
is
bad,
what
--
you
know,
why
should
i
engage
in
--
in
this
exercise?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
make
me
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
--
just
so
we
--
we
know
what
is
--
what
is
going
on
here:
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
petitioner
here
has
said
here
that
if
we
adopt
his
interpretation,
it
will
render
the
statute
constitutional.
he
doesn't
say
that.
he
says
that
if
we
adopt
his
interpretation,
we
can
avoid
reaching
the
constitutional
question,
because
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
it
at
least
requires
the
--
the
kind
of
financial
harm
that
--
that
he
asserts.
so
he
is
not
asserting
that
if
we
--
if
we
accept
his
position,
the
statute
is
constitutional.
i
don't
read
his
brief
as
saying
that,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
--
i
mean,
i'm
still
waiting
to
hear
what
materiality
consists.
it
is
just
--
de
minimus
doesn't
count?
is
that
all
you
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it
--
it
doesn't
answer
the
racing
form
case.
i
mean,
you
are
using
materiality
in
two
senses.
all
you
mean
by
materiality
is
that
the
misrepresentation
must
have
been
material,
okay?
so
in
the
racing
form
case,
let's
say
the
question
the
boss
asked
is,
you
know,
"are
you
going
to
work
hard
this
afternoon?
"
"or
do
i
have
to
stand
here
and
look
over
your
shoulder?
"
and
he
says,
"boss,
i'm
going
to
work
hard
this
afternoon.
"
"okay,
then
i'll
leave".
and
the
boss
leaves.
that
representation
is
material
in
that
it
got
the
boss
to
leave,
whereupon
he
reads
the
racing
form.
but
you
know,
that's
immaterial
in
another
sense,
it's
a
--
it's
not
a
substantial
crime.
and
that's
--
that's
what
we
are
looking
for
here,
something
that
--
that
separates
reading
the
racing
form
from
really
harming
the
employer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
a
substantial
degree.
and
you
have
nothing
in
your
--
in
your
brief
or
in
your
argument
that
eliminates
these
de
minimus
kind
of
--
what
should
i
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--misrepresentations
to
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
my
son
gets
the
money?
i
don't
get
the
money.
my
son
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
adult
son.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
--
that
is
how
a
lawyer
is
supposed
to
advise
his
client.
he
says,
well,
what
this
means
is
the
core
of
pre-mcnally
cases.
[laughter]
and
he
--
and
he
sends
him
off
to
read
the
pre-mcnally
cases.
and
i
have
to
tell
you,
they
are
a
mess,
i
don't
understand
them
at
all.
it's
one
of
the
reasons
mcnally
came
out
the
way
it
did.
is
--
you
speak
as
though
it
is
up
to
us
to
write
the
statute.
we
can
make
it
mean
whatever
it
--
you
know,
whatever
would
--
would
save
it
or
whatever
we
think
is
a
good
idea,
but
that's
not
our
job.
what
--
what
does
the
statute
say?
and,
if
all
it
does
is
refer
us
to
the
pre-mcnally
cases,
i'm
at
--
i'm
at
sea.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
was
wrong.
just
because
it
understood
it
had
a
consistent
core,
it
has
a
consistent
--
consistent
core?
