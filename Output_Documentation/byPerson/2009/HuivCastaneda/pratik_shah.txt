mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
its
plain
terms,
section
233(a)
precludes
any
civil
action
against
officers
and
employees
of
the
public
health
service
arising
out
of
performance
of
their
medical
duties.
instead,
it
makes
an
action
against
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
the
exclusive
remedy
for
injury
arising
out
of
phs-provided
care.
unlike
the
westfall
act,
section
233
contains
no
carve-out
for
constitutional
claims,
nor
is
there
any
textual
basis
for
which
to
imply
one.
accordingly,
this
court
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
allowing
respondents'
bivens
claims
against
the
individual
petitioners
on
top
of
their
ftca
claims
against
the
united
states.
now,
even
assuming
congress
did
not
specifically
have
bivens
claims
in
mind
at
the
time
that
they
enacted
this
statute,
that's
no
reason
to
limit
the
plain
terms
of
section
233(a).
first,
justice
kennedy,
going
to
your
question
about
whether
there's
authority
for
that
proposition
that
when
congress
doesn't
specifically
anticipate
a
certain
set
of
facts
yet
the
plain
terms
control,
that
that
is
the
correct
result,
this
court
has
stated
both
in
the
rico
context
as
well
as
in
other
contexts
that
the
fact
that
congress
doesn't
specifically
contemplate
application
of
the
statute
to
particular
circumstances
simply
demonstrates
the
breadth
of
the
statute
and
not
any
ambiguity.
those
statements
are
set
forth
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
sedima,
yeskey,
and
others.
the
second
point
i
would
make
is
the
best
indication
of
congress's
broad
intent
is
simply
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute.
congress
could
have
enacted
a
statute
that
only
provided
immunity
for,
say,
negligent
performance
of
medical
duties.
it
included
no
such
limitation
in
233(a).
it
could
have
made
the
ftca
remedy
exclusive
of,
say,
only
common
law
causes
of
action
or
state
law
causes
of
action,
or
even
existing
causes
of
action.
it
did
not
do
that.
it
said
it
is
the
exclusive
remedy
for
any
other
civil
action
by
reason
of
the
same
subject
matter.
congress
could--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
that
latter
phrasing
"exclusive
of
any
other
civil
action
or
proceeding.
"
for
example,
the
gonzalez
act,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
gray
brief
on
page
1a
of
our
--
of
the
government's
appendix,
it
uses
very
similar
language.
it
says:
the
ftca
remedy
shall
be
exclusive
of
any
other
civil
action
or
proceeding
by
reason
of
the
same
subject
matter.
that's
identical
language
to
that
used
in
233(a).
now,
there
is
a
way
in
which
233(a)
is
even
broader
than
any
of
those
other
statutes
in
its
description
of
what
type
of
performance
of
medical
duties
is
covered.
there,
there
is
no
modifier
of
negligence
or
wrongful
act
or
omission.
it
simply
says:
any
performance
of
medical
duties
is
covered.
in
the
gonzalez
act,
which
we
would
submit
has
as
quite
broad
language
and
should
have
the
same
effect,
they
at
least
have
a
qualifier
of
negligent
or
wrongful
act
or
omission.
not
that
that
should
create
a
change
in
result,
but
it
just
goes
to
show
the
incredibly
broad
language
that
congress
used
to
show
--
that
congress
used
in
233(a).
and
i
think
on
the
gonzalez
act
point
--
and
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
this
goes
to
your
question
about
whether
there
are
other
statutes
--
even
though
that
congress
may
not
have
contemplated
bivens
at
the
time,
the
gonzalez
act
was
passed
in
1976,
5
years
after
bivens
had
decided,
and
yet
congress
used
the
identical
language
or
nearly
identical
language
as
present
in
233(a)
in
enacting
the
gonzalez
act.
presumably,
congress
was
aware
of
the
potential
for
bivens
liability
at
the
time,
yet
they
chose
to
use
the
same
categorical
text.
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
gonzalez
act,
they
say
they
used
that
text
for
the
specific
purpose
of
ensuring
total
financial
immunity
--
immunity
from
total
financial
liability
for
dod
and
armed
forces
medical
personnel.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
outside
which?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
there's
6,000
--
approximately
6,000
commissioned
officers.
of
those,
slightly
more
than
1,000
of
the
commissioned
phs
officers
work
in
either
the
bureau
of
prisons
or
in
ice
detention
facilities.
so
the
remaining
5,000
of
the
commissioned
officers
may
not
work
in
what
you
would
call
a
strictly
custodial
context.
a
bulk
--
the
majority
of
them
work
for
the
indian
health
service,
and
that's
true
for
both
employees
and
the--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--for
the
indian
health
service.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
would
want
to
immunize
bureau
of
prison
personnel.
and,
in
fact,
that's
where
a
majority
of
these
types
of
claims
come
up.
that,
of
course,
is
another
custodial
setting,
and
--
and
i
think
congress
would
have
been
aware--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--oh,
i
see.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
you're
right.
if
they
were
--
if
they
were
a
bop
employee--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--as
opposed
to
phs
personnel,
then
you're
right,
they
would
fall
under
the
westfall
act,
and
there
would
be
the
carve-out
for
constitutional
claim.
now,
what
we
do
know
is
that
congress
enacted
this
special
protection
for
public
health
service
personnel
and
singled
them
out
at
the
surgeon
general's
request
in
1970.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember,
in
1970
--
this
is
pre-westfall
act
--
it
was
not
at
all
clear
that
federal
medical
personnel
were
immune
even
from
common
law
negligence,
for
example.
and
so
even
from
that
point,
putting
bivens
liability
aside,
congress
chose
to
accord
special
protection
to
phs
personnel
above
and
beyond
that
entitled
to
those
who
they
were
working
with
side
by
side,
say
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
or
in
detention--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well
--
well,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
--
in
terms
of
the
ordinary
claims,
the
common
law
claims,
of
course,
that
would
be
covered
by
the
westfall
act.
in
terms
of
bivens,
in
terms
of
insurance
against
bivens
claims
in
particular,
my
understanding
--
and
this
is
anecdotal
--
is
that
most
--
most
of
the
medical
personnel
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
do
not
have
any
other
protection
beyond
that
that's
provided
by
the
westfall
act.
that
is,
they
don't
have
separate
policies.
there
is
--
at
least
according
to
the
citation
in
respondents'
brief
about
a
web
site
that
shows
that
you
can
get
bivens
insurance.
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
that's
available
to
federal
--
federal
medical
personnel,
at
least
in
the
amounts
of
insurance
that
might
be
necessary
to
adequately
protect
them--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--justice
scalia,
i
completely
agree.
i
think
it's
correct
that
the
important
fact
is
the
fact
that
congress
accorded
them
special
protection.
again,
this
was
--
this
was
at
the
request,
the
specific
request
of
the
surgeon
general,
and
they
did
this
to
help
revitalize
the
public
health
service.
now,
i
don't
think
that
it's
--
that
the
public
health
service
--
it's
anomalous
that
they
get
this
protection.
i
think
they're
in
many
ways
similarly
situated
to
medical
personnel
who
have
served
for
dod
in
the
armed
forces.
like
dod
medical
personnel,
phs
officers
can
be
assigned
to
very
difficult
situations
and
settings,
sometimes
in
armed
conflict,
other
custodial
settings,
and
they
can
be
ordered
to
perform
certain
medical
conditions.
in
the
gonzalez
act
legislative
history,
congress
says
that
that
was
a
reason
--
an
additional
reason
as
to
why
they
wanted
to
accord
immunity.
and
i
think
phs
personnel
are
similarly
situated.
if
this
court
were
looking
for
a
reason,
the
fact
is
they
were
accorded
the
same
immunity,
and
that's
the
dispositive
factor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
i
don't
know
if
they
all
came
out
of
the
same
committee,
but
these
certainly
span
a
wide
spectrum
of
years,
all
the
way
from
the
1960s
to
--
to
the
late
1970s,
in
terms
of
when
these
various
immunity
provisions
were
enacted.
some
of
them
happened
at
the
same
time,
like,
i
believe,
the
provision
for
nasa
personnel
was
added
at
the
same
time
the
gonzalez
act
was
passed.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
it
may
be
a
closer
case
but
i
don't
think
that
the
result
would
be
different,
and
here's
why:
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
233(a)
--
and
this
is
on
the
very
last
page
of
the
--
of
the
government's
brief
--
it
does
refer
to
the
ftca
in
terms
of
the
remedy
that
a
--
that
a
plaintiff
should
seek,
but
it's
not
--
it
does
not
look
to
the
ftca
to
make
that
remedy
exclusive.
instead,
it
provides
independent
language,
independent
of
the
ftca,
to
make
the
remedy
exclusive.
it
says,
"the
remedy
against
the
united
states.
"
under
the
ftca
--
that's
what
it
references
--
"for
damage
for
personal
injury
including
death
resulting
from.
"
medical
performance
--
and
then
it
has
its
own
language
--
"shall
be
exclusive
of
any
other
civil
action
or
proceeding
by
reason
of
the
same
subject
matter.
"
it
does
not
reference
the
ftca
in
that
latter
clause,
and
it's
that
latter
clause
that
makes
the
remedy
exclusive.
so,
regardless
of
the
language
of
the
westfall
act,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference
to
the
result
if
congress
had
used
the
wording
that
you
suggest,
justice
alito.
the
one
--
the
one
final
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
i
think
it
bears
emphasizing
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
no
other
relief
than
a
bivens
remedy
available.
the
ftca
remedy
is
not
only
available
generally,
but
the
united
states
has
already
admitted
liability
on
respondents'
medical
negligence
claim
in
this
case.
the
only
difference
from
respondents'
amount
--
from
respondents'
perspective
now
is
the
amount
of
damages
that
are
recoverable,
and
we
would
submit--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--to
my
knowledge,
plaintiffs
have
not
made
that
argument
in
this
case,
that
they
were
not
acting
within
the
scope.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
they
would
lose
their
ftca
claim
against
the
government,
then,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
thank
you.
