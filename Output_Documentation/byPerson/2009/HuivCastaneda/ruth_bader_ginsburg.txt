what
are
the
immunities
set
forth
in
the
westfall
act?
i
thought
that
they
were
--
they
applied
to
all
federal
employees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
including
the
public
health
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
a
--
there's
a
ceiling,
because
the
tort
claims
act
refers
to
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
in
this
case
it's
california?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
would
put
a
lid
on
the
damages,
since
this
is
a
death
case,
of
250,000?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shah,
is
that
--
is
that
the
same
--
in
all
the
statutes
that
carlson
cites
on
page
20,
when
they
say
that
congress
follows
the
practice
of
explicitly
stating
what
it
means
to
make
the
ftca
an
exclusive
remedy,
there's
this
--
the
gonzalez
act
and
there's
233(a),
and
then
there
is
the
swine
flu.
are
they
all
--
are
all
those
provisions,
provisions
like
233(a),
that
say
"any
civil
action"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
--
could
the
plaintiff
contest
the
certification
that
this
was
within
the
scope
--
and
say
it
was
so
egregious,
it
was
outside
the
scope,
and,
therefore,
it
doesn't
come
--
come
within
233(a)
or
anything
else,
and
so
we
have
a
straight
claim
against
the
defendants?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
they
would
lose
their
argument
against
the
--
i
mean,
they
would
lose
their
claim
against
the
government
if
they
were
taking
that
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
that's
quite
a
surprising
statement
for
you
to
make,
when
the
very
first
statute
that
carlson
mentions
is
233(a).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
get
that
out
of
the
way.
it's
put
on
page
20,
because
one
of
the
reasons
why
carlson
enables
--
allows
the
bivens
act
is
that
it
doesn't
contain
language
and
the
--
and
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
this
--
that
this
paragraph
is
contrasting
statutes
with
carlson,
because
in
carlson
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
other
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
just
(a).
we're
just
talking
about
(a).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
says
233(a),
where
does
that
say
anything
other
than
--
i
mean,
it
reads
like
it's
immunity
from
any
civil
action.
that's
--
those
are
the
words
i
think
that
you
have
to
overcome.
it
says:
plaintiff
has
a
substitute
remedy
against
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
the
employee
is
immune
from
any
civil
action.
and
then
you
say,
but
any
civil
action
doesn't
include
bivens
actions.
and
you
must
be
saying
that
the
later
act
shrinks
the
former
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
amended
233(a)--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--without
mentioning
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
gonzalez
act
is
after
bivens.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
the
same
thing
--
even
though
bivens
was
before
congress
--
and
even
though
the
gonzalez
act
doesn't
have
an
exception
for
bivens
claims,
you
read
one
into
the
gonzalez
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
westfall
act
could
be
read
to
say
we're
now
covering
all
these
people
who
did
not
have,
who
were
not
sheltered
by
immunity
before,
but
this
amendment
saves
out
bivens
claims.
one
could
read
that
as
self-contained
and
not
touching
other
statutes
that
existed
independently
before.
