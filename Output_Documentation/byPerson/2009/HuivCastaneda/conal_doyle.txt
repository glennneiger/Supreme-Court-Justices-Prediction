mr.
conal
doyle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
233
does
not
bar
bivens
claims
here
for
two
principal
reasons.
first,
233
does
not
abrogate
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
because
it
cannot
satisfy
carlson's
explicit
declaration
test,
which
is
a
type
of
clear
statement
rule.
mr.
conal
doyle
your
honor,
i
believe
you're
referring
to
the
dicta
in
carlson
on
page
20.
mr.
conal
doyle
and
it's
interesting
to
note
how
that
issue
was
raised.
in
the
briefs,
it
wasn't
raised
arguing
that
233(a)
bars
bivens
claims;
the
government
didn't
make
that
argument.
and,
in
fact,
it
was
raised
in
the
respondents'
cert
petition
or
brief
in
opposition
for
the
proposition
that
--
that
the
language
of
that
statute
actually
allowed
a
bivens
claim
because
it
didn't
preclude
it.
and
in
--
in
response
the
government
actually
argued
that
because
bivens
hadn't
been
decided
in
--
in
1970,
that
it
could
not
have
possibly
preserved
bivens
claims.
so
it
was
actually
the
opposite
issue
that
was
--
that
was
addressed
in
carlson--
mr.
conal
doyle
--justice
ginsburg,
if
i
may
reply,
i
believe
that
that's
not
the
proper
way
to
read
that
dicta
for
two
reasons.
first,
i
think
justice
stevens
mentioned
the
assistant
surgeon
general
of
the
united
states
was
actually
a
defendant
in
the
case,
and
so
although
this
233(a)
immunity
wasn't
--
wasn't
decided
in
carlson,
certainly
the
court
was
aware
that
a
--
that
a
public
health
service
defendant
was
in
the
case,
and
they
wouldn't
have
permitted
an
action
to
move
forward
against
that
defendant
had
they
believed
that
233
barred
bivens.
and,
second,
it
--
it
specially
characterizes
the
explicit
declaration
as
applying
to
malpractice,
not
bivens
claims.
and
other
--
for
example,
another
statute
in
the
category
there
was
the
federal
drivers
act,
and
certainly
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
a
federal
driver
could
be
liable
under
--
under
bivens.
and
so
i
think
a
better
reading
of
that
dicta
is
that
the
court
is
just
saying:
here's
an
example;
these
statutes
show
that
when
congress
makes
an
explicit
declaration,
but
the
issue
is
explicit
as
to
what?
and
it's
clear
i
think
from
reading
that
dicta
based
on
the
existence
of
the
surgeon
general
in
the
case
and
the
fact
that
the
dicta
was
qualified,
that
it
didn't
apply
to
bivens.
but
moving
back
to
the
carlson
test,
233
can't
satisfy
the
test
because
carlson
never
even
--
or
congress
never
considered
whether
the
ftca
was
a
substitute
for
bivens
in
1970.
and
this
point
is
underscored
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
enacted
before
bivens
and
that
the
cause
of
action
at
issue
here
wasn't
recognized
until
10
years
later
in
carlson.
and,
second,
when
congress
did
finally
consider
for
the
first
time
whether
the
ftca
was
an
adequate
substitute
for
bivens
in
1988,
it
expressly
preserved,
rather
than
barred,
bivens
claims
in
the
westfall
act.
and
the
westfall
act
was
a
comprehensive
statute
that
was
intended
to
provide
an
overhaul
of
personal
immunity
at
the
request
of
this
court
in
westfall
v.
erwin,
and
it
applied
to
all
federal
employees,
including
members
of
the
public
health
service.
and
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
smith.
and
petitioners'
reading
here
would
actually
require
this
court
to
write
in
an
implied
exception
to
the
westfall
act
that
doesn't
exist,
that
would
exempt
out
public
health
service
personnel
from
the
explicit
carve-out
of
bivens.
moreover,
the
petitioners'
reading
here--
mr.
conal
doyle
--no,
your
honor,
there's
no
implicit
repeal
here,
although
we
can--
mr.
conal
doyle
--your
honor,
there's
no
implicit
repeal
here
for
the
--
because
233(a)
still
has
independent
work
to
do.
but
we
do
concede
that
under
our
reading,
there
would
be
no
--
it
wouldn't
really
do
any
more
work
for
public
health
service
employees,
because
they
have
a
broader
protection
under
the
westfall
act,
because
it
applies
to
any
wrongful
act
or
omission.
mr.
conal
doyle
the
provision--
mr.
conal
doyle
--well,
there
were
no
--
there
would
be
no
repeal
because
there
are
a
number
of
other
provisions
within
section
233
itself
that
it's
relevant
to.
and
so
the
public
health
service
act--
mr.
conal
doyle
--yes,
but
these
other
provisions
refer
back
to
(a).
and
if
i
could--
mr.
conal
doyle
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
and
i
don't
mean
to
repeat
myself,
but
to
answer
that
question--
mr.
conal
doyle
--i
believe
there
is.
but
i
think
that
the
fundamental
issue
you
have
to
look
at,
your
honor,
is
whether,
in
1970,
congress
intended
to
abrogate
a
constitutional
cause
of
action.
and
in
this
court's
line
of
clear
statements--
mr.
conal
doyle
--okay.
mr.
conal
doyle
there's
--
there's
two
relationships
between
the
westfall
act
and
the
public
health
service
act.
first,
the
westfall
act
simply
applies
on
its
face
to
all
government
employees.
this
court
has
held
that,
and
so--
mr.
conal
doyle
--justice
breyer,
if
i
could
answer.
this
court,
in
smith,
held
that
the
immunity
conferred
by
section
(1)
applies
to
all
federal
employees.
and
you
have
to
read
(1)
and
(2)
together.
i
mean,
you
can't
divorce
them,
because
section
(1)
grants
immunity,
but
subsection
(2)
affects
it
and
--
and
helps
define
it
by
saying
that--
mr.
conal
doyle
--yes.
and
that
said--
mr.
conal
doyle
--well,
it
isn't
--
the
older
act
refers
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
as
providing
the
exclusive
remedy
in
this
case.
and
the
ftca
is
the
only
remedial
scheme
in
the
case.
so,
in
other
words,
233
doesn't
set
forth
within
it
different
remedies
that
prospective
plaintiffs
can
get
against
the
public
health
services.
it
decided
to
define
it
by
referring
to
the--
ftca.
and
when
you
go
to
the--
mr.
conal
doyle
--it
is.
right.
mr.
conal
doyle
the
westfall
act
is
just
simply
an
amendment
to
the
ftca.
mr.
conal
doyle
okay.
well,
the
first
clause
of
section
233(a)
states
that
--
that
the
remedy
against
the
united
states
provided
by
1346(b)
is
remedy
available.
and
so
you
go
to
1346(b),
and
congress
defined
the
1346(b)
--
i
believe
it's
on
page
5a
of
the
--
of
our
appendix
--
and
says
that
--
that
the
remedy
is
subject
to
the
entire
provisions
of
the
ftca.
and
so
you
have
to
look
to
the
entire
provisions
of
the
ftca
to
determine
what
the
remedy
is,
because--
mr.
conal
doyle
--the
later
act
amended
the
former
act;
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
conal
doyle
it
--
it
did,
in--
mr.
conal
doyle
--effect,
because
it's
incorporated
by
reference
through
the
act.
so
1346(b),
the
first
sentence
says
"subject
to
the
provisions
of
chapter
171.
"
which
is
the
entire
ftca.
and
within
that
chapter,
there's
a
provision
entitled
"exclusiveness
of
remedy".
and
that
defines
--
and
that
really
addresses
the
precise
issue
before
the
court,
whether
the
ftca
is
the
exclusive
remedy
here
for
a
bivens
action.
and
it
specifically
says
in
that
section
that
bivens
actions
are
excluded.
and
so
if
you
want
to
find
out
what
remedy
is
available
to
a
prospective
plaintiff,
you
have
to
look
at
how
congress
defined
the
remedy,
and
it
specifically
defined
it
by
limiting
it
under
its
exclusiveness
clause
to
common
law
torts,
not
bivens
claims.
but
i
think
one
of
the
key
principles
here
that
we
have
to
acknowledge
is
that
you
defer
--
the
court
defers
to
congress
in
policy
considerations
like
this
because
presumably
congress
is
in
a
better
position
than
the
court
to
--
to
weigh
policy
decisions
like
providing
immunity
to
certain
government
employees.
but
the
deference
there
is
only
appropriate
where
congress
has
actually
faced
the
issue
and
balanced
the
policy
considerations.
and
it
could
not
have
done
so
in
1970,
because
bivens
hadn't
been
decided;
estelle
v.
gamble
hadn't
been
decided
until
1976,
which
--
which
established
the
deliberate
indifference
standard;
and
then
carlson
wasn't
decided
until
1980.
and
when
congress,
for
the
first
time,
actually
looked
at
the
issue--
mr.
conal
doyle
--only
--
only
as
to
constitutional
causes
of
action,
justice
scalia.
and
i
think--
mr.
conal
doyle
--well,
i
think
that
the
issue
here
is,
is
that
when
congress
is
going
to
--
was
going
to
abrogate
a
constitutional
right
or
recognize
a
constitutional
remedy,
it
has
to
do
so
in
a
clear
way.
and
in,
for
example,
webster
v.
doe
or,
in
effect,
the
blatchfield
--
blatchford
case,
has
very
similar
language.
it's
all
civil
actions,
and
that's
in
a
context
of
whether
indians
can
bring
an
action
against
the
state
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
all
civil
actions
did
not
include
the
right
to
bring
an
action
against
the
eleventh
amendment
--
a
state
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
because
you're
dealing
with
a
constitutional
issue.
and
in
this
case
--
i
think
that
goes
to
justice
kennedy's
point
--
we're
not
saying
that,
you
know,
any
cause
of
action
that
perhaps
was
created
after
1970
wouldn't
be
barred,
but
when
you're
talking
about
a
constitutional
cause
of
action,
there
is
a
difference.
and
you
--
congress
has
to
at
least
consider
the
issue,
balance
the
policy
considerations,
and
make
an
informed
decision
in
order
for
this
court
to
abrogate
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
conal
doyle
well,
carlson
sets
forth
the
clear
statement
rule
here,
the
explicit
declaration
test,
and
then--
mr.
conal
doyle
--i
think
webster
v.
doe
is
another
example
of
a
case
where
this
court
would
not
abrogate
a
constitutional
right
based
on
fairly
clear
language
that
said
the
director
of
the
cia
had
discretion
to
terminate
anybody.
and
in
that
case,
he
terminated
a
cia
employee
because
he
was
homosexual,
and
he
brought
a
variety
of
different
constitutional
causes
of
action.
and
then,
you
know,
the
court
held
that
to
abrogate
a
constitutional
cause
of
action,
there
has
to
be
--
there
has
to
be
a
clear
statement.
and
so
we
don't
believe
there
has
been
that
clear
statement,
but--
mr.
conal
doyle
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
conal
doyle
and
so,
it's
not--
mr.
conal
doyle
--it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
apply
as
--
as
strongly,
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
sequence
of
enactment
is
dispositive,
i
think
is
the
point.
mr.
conal
doyle
or
constitutional,
but
it
has
to
be
clear
that
congress
addressed
the
issue
and
considered
abrogating
a
constitutional
claim.
i
mean,
that's
what
the
cases
are
clear
about.
and
so--
mr.
conal
doyle
--it
is.
mr.
conal
doyle
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
say
the
gonzalez
act
also
wouldn't
bar
bivens
claims,
because
it's
just
the
sequence
of
enactment
--
but
i
mean,
if
it
was
--
if
it
had
shown
in
some
way
that
congress
considered
the
constitutional
issue
--
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
gonzalez
act
shows
that
it
did
not
at
that
time
--
if
there
was
some
indication
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
anywhere
that
a
constitutional--
mr.
conal
doyle
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia,
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
conal
doyle
no,
your
honor.
and
if
i
--
if
i
meant
to
imply
that,
i
misspoke.
mr.
conal
doyle
it
--
it
--
i
think
that
in
the
statute,
in
the
--
in
the
text
of
the
statute
itself,
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
from
congress
that
it
considered
it.
i
think
that
you
can
look
at
other
factors
to
try
to
figure
out
what
--
what
congress
was
thinking,
of
course.
however,
in
this
case,
i
think
the
point
is
clear
that
whether
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
whether
you
look
at
the
alternative
remedial
scheme--
mr.
conal
doyle
--that
--
that's
correct.
you
have
to
start
with
the
text.
mr.
conal
doyle
well,
obviously
if
--
if
the
statute
unambiguously
bars
constitutional
claims
by
mentioning
the
constitution,
i
don't
think
you
look
at
the
legislative
history.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
conal
doyle
i
think
that
if
--
if
--
if
any
statute
is
ambiguous--
mr.
conal
doyle
--you
can
look
to
the
legislative
history.
mr.
conal
doyle
well,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
and
--
and
--
and
the
carlson
test--
mr.
conal
doyle
--your
honor,
all
i'm
saying
is
that--
mr.
conal
doyle
--all
i'm
saying
is,
i
believe,
is
that
--
is
that
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
the
actual
statute
that's
at
issue,
no
matter
what
test
you
use,
whether
you
--
whether
you
--
whether
you
like
legislative
history,
whether
you
--
whether
you
only
look
at
plain
text,
or
whether
you
want
to
look
at
what's
the
alternative
remedy,
is
it
equivalent
to
a
constitutional
claim,
this
statute
doesn't
pass
muster.
it
is
clear
that
congress
never
considered
whether
or
not
to
abrogate
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
in
1970.
mr.
conal
doyle
your
honor,
again,
i
don't
want
to
repeat
my
answer
to
that
question,
but
just
to
emphasize
that
--
that
the
court
in
carlson
did
not
specifically
say
that
bivens
claims
were
barred
by
reference
to
233.
it
mentioned
malpractice.
and
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
malpractice
and
deliberate
indifference
in
1980,
because
estelle
had
been
decided
4
years
earlier.
so,
one
of
the
other
anomalies
here
is
that
looking
at
--
at
--
at
the
practical
effect,
going
to
your
implied
repeal
question,
justice
scalia,
the
only
work
that
--
that
233(a)
would
have
left
to
do
under
the
petitioners'
reading
is
--
is
to
bar
bivens
claims.
and
when
congress
enacted
the
statute
in
1970,
bivens
didn't
even
exist.
and
so,
the
protection
that
--
the
--
the
position
that
we
are
advocating
protects
doctors
because
the
westfall
act
extends
much
broader
immunity
to
common
law
torts,
to
any
wrongful
act
or
omission,
not
just
actions
performing
medical
functions.
and
so,
this
is
completely
consistent
with
congress's
intent
in
1970
when
constitutional
claims
didn't
even
exist.
and
so,
when
congress
looked
at
the
issue,
examined
it
and
decided
whether
--
whether
there's
a
difference
between
bivens
and
the
common
law
and
whether
the
ftca
was
adequate
to
substitute
for
bivens,
it
made
a
decision
to
expressly
preserve
bivens
actions
in
this
case.
and
even
if,
your
honors,
you
believe
that
233
bars
bivens
claims
here,
you
have
to
reconcile
it
with
the
westfall
act,
because
the
westfall
act
expressly
preserves
bivens
claims.
and
it
is
a
comprehensive
statute;
it
is
a
later
passed
statute;
and
it
is
specific
to
the
issue
before
the
court,
which
is
can
--
can
a
bivens
claim
be
brought
against
a
public
health
service
doctor?
mr.
conal
doyle
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
a
reasonable
reading,
because
at
the
time
of
the
westfall
act's
passage
in
1988,
no
court
had
held
that
bivens
claims
were
barred
by
section
233
or
any
other
pre-act
immunity
statute
like
the
gonzalez
act
or
and
the
va
act.
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
westfall
act
shows
that,
in
1988,
congress
believed
that
the
westfall
act
would
simply
extend
the
protections
available
to
--
to
government
employees
before
westfall
v.
erwin,
and
that
--
and
that
people
would
still
be
able
to
bring
constitutional
claims
against
members
of
the
federal
government.
and
so,
congress
had
no
reason
in
1988
to
go
back
and
amend
the
--
the
earlier
passed
233,
because
there
was
no
indication
--
judicial
construction
or
the
legislative
history
--
that
233
ever
barred
bivens
claims
in
the
first
place.
and
so,
adopting
the
petitioners'
position
in
this
case
would
--
would
subvert
congressional
intent,
because
it
would
say
that,
you
know,
when
congress
finally
weighed
all
of
the
considerations
in
the
case,
decided
whether
bivens
and
the
ftca
were
adequate,
it
decided
to
--
it
decided
to
preserve
bivens
claims
rather
than
bar
them.
and
--
and
--
and
so,
accepting
the
petitioners'
position
would
just
subvert
that
intent
based
on
an
act
that
was
passed
prior
to
bivens
existing,
prior
to
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
being
accepted
for
this
type
of
action,
and
it
--
and
it
would
just
be
completely
inconsistent
with
what
congress
has
--
has
done
to
protect
federal
employees.
mr.
conal
doyle
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i
got
to
finish
that
answer
before.
but
if
you
look
at
--
at
the
appendix
to
our
--
our
brief
from
page
28
to
62,
there's
two
pages
in
there,
page
29
and
page
55,
that
show
that
section
(a)
still
has
meaning,
because
there's
a
host
of
non-federal
employees,
people
that
--
that
are
government
contractors
that
provide
services
to
free
health
clinics
and
the
like
that
can
be
deemed
employees
of
the
public
health
service
and
then
take
advantage
of
their
immunity.
but
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
immunity
under
ftca,
because
they
aren't
federal
employees.
so
233(a)
still
has
work
to
do,
even
under
our
construction.
and
so,
surely,
it
would
not
protect
public
health
service
employees
any
more
because
they
have
greater
protections
in
the
westfall
act,
and,
again,
the
petitioners'
reading
here
would
--
the
only
work
it
would
have
left
to
do
would
be
to
bar
bivens
claims,
but
bivens
didn't
even
exist
in
1970,
when
--
that
the
act
was
passed.
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
make
much
common
sense.
and
before
i
--
i
conclude,
i
just
want
to
speak
for
a
moment
about,
you
know,
the
importance
of
this
case
under
the
--
the
bivens
jurisprudence.
i
mean,
the
purpose
of
bivens
--
this
court
has
acknowledged
recently
in
meyer
and
malesko
is
to
provide
deterrence
to
--
to
federal
officers.
and
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
case
that
--
that
--
where
deterrence
is
important,
because
government
employees
should
not
feel
that
they
can
--
they
can--
mr.
conal
doyle
--not
for
the
--
not
for
a
bivens
claim,
and--
mr.
conal
doyle
--it
depends.
sometimes
they
can't.
mr.
conal
doyle
yes.
mr.
conal
doyle
no,
they
haven't
collected
money
yet.
mr.
conal
doyle
on
one
claim,
but
one
of
our
claims,
the
most
important
claim
here,
is
--
is
--
will
be
extinguished
under
california
law,
which
highlights
why,
you
know,
congress
would
not
want
to
--
why
this
court
in
carlson,
first
of
all,
said
that
the
ftca
is
not
an
effective
substitute
for
bivens,
and
congress
ratified
that
decision
8
years
later
in
the
westfall
act
by
finding
the
same
thing,
that
--
that
bivens
claims
and
the
ftca
are
complementary
and
parallel
causes
of
action,
because
for
the
very
reason
that,
under
california
law
in
this
case,
a
survival
claim
for
pre-death
pain
and
suffering
for
--
for
mr.
castaneda,
who
endured
an
incredible
ordeal
for
2
years
at
the
hands
of
a
government
medical
provider,
that
that
--
that
claim
would
be
barred.
and
so
i
would
urge
this
court
to
follow
its
--
its
precedent
in
carlson
and
recognize
that
congress,
8
years
later
in
the
westfall
act,
actually
ratified
that
holding
that
said
that
the
ftca
is
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
bivens
action
for
the
reasons
i've
set
forth.
thank
you,
your
honor.
