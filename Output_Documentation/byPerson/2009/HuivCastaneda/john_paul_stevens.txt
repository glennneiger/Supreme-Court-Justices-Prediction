comment

justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
the
fact
that,
in
the
carlson
case,
apparently
the
assistant
surgeon
general
was,
in
fact,
a
defendant,
and
the
government
failed
to
make
this
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you're
right,
they
should
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that's
kind
of
interesting
that
apparently
the
government
was
not
aware
of
the
breadth
of
the
position
they're
--
you're
now
taking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
think
your
clear
statement
argument
would
apply
even
if
carlson
had
been
decided
before
the
statute
was
enacted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument?
is
the
westfall
act
--
would
it
have
covered
every
immunity
that
the
public
health
act
previously
provided?
so,
is
it
correct
that
the
--
the
prior
statute
is
now
totally
unnecessary
and
does
nothing
except
preserve
the
bivens
--
preserve
the
immunity
for
bivens
actions?
