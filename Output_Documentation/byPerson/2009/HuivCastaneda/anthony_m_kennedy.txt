justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that,
quite
apart
from
the
westfall
act,
there's
a
more
--
more
basic
answer
that
you
would
make
to
justice
sotomayor's
question.
and
that
is,
because
the
nature
of
immunity
clauses
are
to
make
the
employees
secure
against
unforeseen
causes
of
action
as
well
as
foreseen.
i
think
that's
a
principled
answer
you
could
make.
if
i
made
that
answer,
do
you
have
authority
i
could
cite
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
limit
it,
then
congress
would
have
to
reenact
a
statute
every
time
there
was
some
new
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
would
bar
a
later
bivens
claim.
i
assume
you
could
bring
a
bivens
action
first,
and
the
bar
provision
would
not
apply,
assuming
you
can
bring
the
bivens
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
carlson
is
your
best
authority
for
that?
even
though
i
don't
think
carlson
is
directly
on
point,
carlson
is
still
your
best
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
a
different
context,
but
that
--
but
carlson
is
still
your
best
authority
for
that
proposition?
