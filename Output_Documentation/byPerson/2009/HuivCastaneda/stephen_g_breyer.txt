justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
your
westfall
act
argument.
i
must
be
missing
something.
my
understanding
is,
many
years
ago,
congress
passes
a
statute
and
says:
give
absolute
immunity
from
bivens
actions.
sue
the
government;
don't
sue
the
employee.
it
says
that,
basically.
a
long
time
ago.
then,
sometime
after,
congress
passes
another
statute,
and
in
paragraph
(a)
of
that
statute,
it
says:
an
even
larger
group
of
people,
just
sue
the
government.
and
then
it
says:
as
to
this
larger
group
of
people,
paragraph
(1)
of
this
statute
doesn't
apply
to
bivens
actions.
so,
what
does
that
got
to
do
with
this
earlier
statute?
doesn't
it
refer
to
it.
i
don't
--
in
other
words,
i
understand
your
carlson
argument.
i
got
that
one,
but
i
don't
understand
this
argument
if
i
have
the
statutes
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
an
answer
to
the
question?
because
that
would
be
important.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
carlson
argument.
i
got
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that
one.
the
one
i
don't
understand
is
what's
the
relation
of
the
westfall
act
to
this
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right.
they
give
the
government
employees
the
same
kind
of
immunity
that
--
a
little
more
limited,
and
that's
in
paragraph
(1).
and
then
paragraph
(2)
says:
paragraph
(1)
doesn't
apply
to
bivens
actions.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
earlier
statute.
it
applies
to
a
different
group
of
people.
it
has
all
kinds
of
requirements,
nothing
involved
with
233.
okay.
so,
what
is
it
to
do
with
this
case?
now,
what
i'm
thinking
now
from
your
hesitation
is
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case;
it's
the
carlson
thing
that
is
the
important
thing.
now,
you
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
talking
about
the
westfall
act.
absolutely
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
say,
what
does
the
act
have
to
do
with
this
older
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
westfall
--
westfall
act
is
not
--
is
not
the
ftca,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
it
is
the
--
in
other
words,
you
think
--
i
thought
the
ftca
act
is
an
act
that
gives
you
action
against
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
says:
this
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy
--
the
ftca
is
an
exclusive
remedy
for
all
employees,
but
this
provision
which
gives
us
an
exception
does
not
give
you
the
exception,
does
not
make
it
exclusive
for
bivens
actions.
okay.
you
go
ahead.
you
explain
it
to
me.
i
don't
want
to
keep
repeating
my
skepticism,
i
want
to
listen.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
his
point
is
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
did
or
didn't
consider
it;
the
question
is
the
statute
was
decided
by
justice
brennan
as
an
example
of
a
statute
where
congress
did
explicitly
say
whatever
it
thought
that
this
particular
remedy
was
a
remedy
exclusive,
an
exclusive
remedy,
and
that
satisfied
the
second
requirement
of
carlson.
that
was
justice
ginsburg's
first
question.
and
--
and
there
--
that's,
i
think,
the
problem
for
you
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can't
they
sue
the
federal
government
and
collect
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean,
can't
your
clients
--
anybody
who
has
a
case
like
yours
--
can't
they
sue
the
federal
government
and
collect
damages
for
their
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
your
clients
sue
the
federal
government?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
collect
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but
if
they
win,
will
they?
