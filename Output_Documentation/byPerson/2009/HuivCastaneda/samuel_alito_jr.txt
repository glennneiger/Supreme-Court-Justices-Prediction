if
section
2679(b)(2),
instead
of
saying
paragraph
(1)
does
not
extend
nor
apply,
had
said
the
remedy
against
the
united
states
provided
by
sections
1346(b),
et
cetera,
and
repeated
that
language
from
(b)(1),
and
then
said:
"is
not
the
exclusive
remedy
in
any
civil
action
against
an
employee
of
the
government.

and
continued
with
subsection
