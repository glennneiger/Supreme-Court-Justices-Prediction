justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
i
don't
look
to
see
what
congress
intended.
i
look
to
see
what
the
statute
says.
i
don't
know
that
we
--
we
--
we
psychoanalyze
the
text
of
a
statute
on
the
basis
of
what
the
congress
at
that
time
knew.
the
text
says
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
we're
--
you
know,
we're
talking
here
as
though
congress
is
a
perpetual
unchanging
institution.
why
would
it
have
done
this
for
public
health
service
employees
and
not
have
done
this
for
bureau?
it
wasn't
the
same
congress
that
passed
those
two
acts.
the
one
may
have
been
a
stingier
congress
than
the
other,
or
there
--
there
may
have
been
more
lobbying
by
one
of
the
other
groups
in
one
case.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
we
have
to
philosophically
reconcile
the
--
the
granting
of
--
of
greater
immunity
to
public
health
service
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
do
all
of
these
immunity
provisions
come
out
of
the
same
committee?
or
can
one
assume
that
the
public
health
service
may
have
come
out
of
one
committee
of
congress,
the
bureau
of
prisons
may
have
come
out
of
another
committee
of
congress,
the
dod
may
have
come
out
of
a
third
committee
of
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
claim
the
westfall
act
implicitly
repealed
233(a)?
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
provision
says
that
it's
exclusive,
and
you're
saying
the
westfall
act
says
it's
not
exclusive.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
isn't
just
made
superfluous.
it
is
repealed.
the
provision
of
it
that
says
"it
shall
be
exclusive"
is
repealed.
justice
antonin
scalia
implicitly,
because
it's
not
specifically
referred
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
any
--
any
other
civil
action
that
--
that
did
not
exist
prior
to
the
enactment
of
233(a)
would
not
be
covered
by
its
exclusion
because
congress
couldn't
have
known
that
this
civil
action
existed,
so
that
it
only
covered
those
causes
of
action
that
existed
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
mean,
if
your
theory
is
it
doesn't
preclude
anything
they
didn't
know
about,
if
they
didn't
know
about
something,
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
what
--
what
reason
is
there
to
say
it's
precluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
legislative
history
will
do,
so
--
so
we
don't
require
this
clear
statement,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
legislative
history
will
do
the
job,
so
you're
abandoning
the
--
the
proposition
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
statement
by
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you
said.
i
thought
you
said
if
--
if
it
was
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
considered
bivens
actions
and
nonetheless
enacted
language
similar
to
233(a),
that
wouldn't
be
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you're
confusing
me
again.
[laughter]
is
--
is
--
is
important
what
congress
was
thinking
or
what
congress
said?
i
thought
your
proposition
was,
unless
the
statute
says
that
it
bans
constitutional
actions,
it
doesn't.
is
that
your
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it
doesn't
matter
what
congress
was
thinking,
does
it?
unless
congress
says
that,
your
--
your
position
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but,
ah,
but
if
it
doesn't
unambiguously
bar
it,
you
can
then
look
to
legislative
history
and
say
although
it
didn't
bar
it,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
was
intended
to
bar
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
abandoning
carlson
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
carlson
was
your
big
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
abandoned
its
proposition
that
there
has
to
be
a
statement
in
the
statute.
