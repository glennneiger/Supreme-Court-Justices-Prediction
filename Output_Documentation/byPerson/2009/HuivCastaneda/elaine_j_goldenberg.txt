ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i'm
very
glad,
your
honor.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
section
233(a),
congress
extended
an
absolute
immunity
to
officers
and
employees
of
the
public
health
service.
that
provision,
reflecting
congress's
policy
judgment
that
the
immunity
was
necessary
to
revitalize
the
public
health
service,
makes
a
claim
against
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
the
exclusive
remedy
for
injury
or
death
resulting
from
the
performance
of
medical
or
related
functions
and
precludes
any
other
civil
action
or
proceeding
against
the
individuals
by
reason
of
the
same
subject
matter.
without
grappling
with
the
language
of
section
233(a),
respondents
have
tried
in
a
number
of
different
ways
to
imply
a
limitation
into
the
test
for
constitutional
claims,
but
none
of
those
arguments
creates
any
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
bivens
exception,
found
in
the
westfall
act
itself,
applies
only
to
the
immunity
set
forth
in
the
westfall
act
and
says
nothing
about
the
scope
of
the
entirely
separate
and
distinct
immunity
set
forth
in
section
233.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
yes,
that's
correct.
public
health
service
employees
can
take
advantage
both
of
the
immunities
set
forth
in
the
westfall
act
and
also
of
the
separate,
preexisting,
more
specific
immunity
that's
afforded
to
them
by
section
233(a).
and
this
court's
decision
in
smith,
i
think,
made
clear
that
those
two
immunities
can
coexist.
there's
no
conflict
between
them.
and
what
this
court
said
in
smith
is
that
the
westfall
act
immunity
adds
to
the
prior
immunity,
and
employees
can
take
advantage
of
both
of
them.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
certainly
it's
true
that
when
congress
enacted
the
westfall
act
it
could
have
broadly
said,
for
instance,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
no
federal
employee
shall
assert
a
statutory
immunity
to
constitutional
claims.
but
it
didn't
do
that.
it
did
something
much
more
narrow
than
that,
which
is
that
what
it
said
was
in
section
2679(b)(2),
paragraph
(1)
--
the
immunity
for
federal
employees
that
was
just
set
forth
shall
not
apply
to
constitutional
claims.
and
that's--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--yes.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
there
are
a
number
of
them,
your
honor.
most
of
them
apply
to
federal
medical
workers,
although
not
all
of
them.
there
is
10
u.s.c.
section
1089,
the
gonzalez
act,
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
and
in
the
government's
brief,
which
applies
to
army
doctors.
there
are
statutes
applying
to
nasa
doctors,
to
veterans
administration
doctors,
to
certain
medical
volunteers.
so
there
are
a
number
of
these
statutes
passed
over
a
period
of
several
decades.
but
in--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
i
think
that
this
court
has,
you
know,
broadly
speaking,
in
talking
about
judicially
created
immunities
--
that
immunity
is
for
hard
cases
as
well
as
easy
cases.
and
the
van
de
kamp
decision
that
this
court
recently
issued
with
respect
to
judicial
immunity
i
think
says--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--something
along
those
lines.
but
i
think
it's
true,
certainly,
that
--
it's
true
that
congress,
when
it
passed
section
233,
didn't
know
for
sure
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
bivens
cause
of
action
that
was
going
to
be
allowed.
but
it
spoke
very
broadly.
it
said
"any
other
civil
action
or
proceeding.
"
and
when
it
did
that,
it
surely
meant
civil
actions
or
proceedings
that
were
created
by
the
courts
at
some
later
point
in
time
as
well
as
those
that
existed
at
the
time.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
exactly,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
problem
with
the
interpretation
that
makes
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
depend
on
the
timing
of
the
bivens
decision
is
pointed
up
by
two
different
statutory
provisions
and
the
odd
results
that
you
would
have.
one
is
that
the
gonzalez
act,
which
i
referred
to
earlier
--
it's
10
u.s.c.
section
1089
--
was
enacted
in
1976,
it
has
immunity-conferring
language
that's
extremely
similar
to
the
immunity-conferring
language
of
section
233(a).
in
fact,
we
know
that
when
congress
enacted
the
gonzalez
act,
it
looked
at
and
thought
about
section
233(a),
and
yet
if
it
mattered
whether
bivens
had
yet
been
decided,
the
gonzalez
act
would
bar
bivens
claims,
but
233(a)
wouldn't,
even
though
you
can't
make
that
kind
of
distinction
based
on
their
text.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree.
and
the
text
here
is
very
broad
and
very
clear
that
it's
any
other
civil
action
or
proceeding
that--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--that
results
from
the
same
subject
matter.
and
i
think
one
thing
that's
important
is
that
"subject
matter"
here
clearly
means
the
same
set
of
facts
or
the
same
set
of
circumstances.
so
that,
it
--
it's
not
the
case
that
you
only
get
immunity
where
your
cause
of
action
is
somehow
similar
to
the
cause
of
action
you
have
under
the
ftca.
if
you
--
you
get
immunity
if
you
have
any
claim
against
the
individuals
that
comes
out
of
the
--
the
same
set
of
facts,
even
if
it
were
true
that
there
was
some
requirement
of
an
ftca
remedy,
which
we
don't
believe
there
is.
and
what's
absolutely
clear
here
as
well
is
that
respondents
do
have
an
ftca
remedy
against
the
united
states.
they
have
brought
an
ftca
claim
against
the
united
states.
the
united
states
has
admitted
liability
on
that
claim.
that's
found
at
page
328
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
so
the
question
now
is,
what
damages
will
the
respondents
recover
from
the
united
states?
and
--
and
in
that
setting,
most
certainly
the
claim
against
the
individuals
is
barred
by
section
233(a).
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
your
honor,
california
law
is
what's
been
discussed
in
the
briefs.
i
understand
that
it's
possible
that
respondents
might
argue
that
some
of
the
acts
or
omissions
here
took
place
in
the
district
of
columbia,
because
that's
the
place
where
some
of
the
decisions
were
made
about
the
treatment
authorization
requests.
but
california
law
is
what
has
been
asserted
so
far
in
the
case.
that's
true.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
not
exactly,
your
honor.
there
is
no
limit
whatsoever
on
the
economic
damages
in
a
case
arising
out
of
professional
negligence.
there
is,
under
california
law,
a
$250,000
cap
on
noneconomic
damages.
as
we
have
said
in
our
briefs,
we
think
that
in
this
case,
where
respondents
have
argued
intentional
wrongdoing
by
the
united
states,
for
which
they
can
recover
under
the
ftca,
if
they
can
prove
that
something
more
than
negligence
was
at
issue,
then
it's
possible
under
california
law,
although
california
law
is
not
entirely
clear,
that
they
could
actually
exceed
that
$250,000
cap
for
noneconomic
damages.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
why
the
defense
wasn't
raised
in
the
case.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
not
necessarily,
because
there
may
be
factual
issues
that
--
that
we're
not
now
aware
of.
in
other
words,
it
may
be
that
the
government
concluded
that,
despite
what
was
alleged
in
the
complaint,
that
when
that
particular
individual
took
the
acts
complained
of,
he
wasn't
somehow
wearing
his
phs
hat,
he
was
operating
in
some
other
capacity.
so
--
but
that's
obviously
just
speculation.
and
it's
--
it
is
not
clear
why
that
defense
wasn't
raised.
what
is
clear
is
that
it
was
not
raised
and,
not
only
that,
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court,
there
is
no
reference
made
to
the
fact
that
he's
in
the
public
health
service.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
necessarily
the
conclusion
i
would
draw.
as
i
say,
there
may
be
factual
reasons
why
it
wasn't
raised.
there
may
be
strategic
reasons
why
it
wasn't
raised.
it's
hard
to
speculate
on
that
so
long
after
the
--
after
the
fact.
but
what
is
clear
from
carlson
is
that
the
way
that
section
233(a)
did
arise
in
that
case
is
that
the
court
used
it
as
a
specific
example
to
contrast
with
the
ftca
itself,
and
said
that
section
233
was
a
place
where
congress
had
made
known
explicitly
its
intent
that
the
ftca
be
the
exclusive
remedy
and
that
other
remedies
be
precluded.
that's
the
way
that
233(a)
was
argued
in
the
briefs
in
that
case,
and
that's
how
the
court
used
it.
and
that's
obviously
extremely
supportive
of
the
petitioners'
plea
for
immunity
here.
this
court
has
already
essentially
recognized
in
carlson,
in
reasoning
in
support
of
its
holding,
that
that
is
the
role
that
233(a)
plays,
and
the
court
must
have
been
talking
about
barring
bivens
claims
because
that's
what
carlson
was
about.
so
that's
the
significance
of
233(a)
in
that
case.
the
respondents
also
--
on
a
subject
we
haven't
touched
on
yet,
i
think,
look
at
the
title
of
section
233(a)
and
some
of
its
other
subsections,
and
there
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
title
can't
vary
the
clear
statutory
text
in
any
way.
even
if
the
title
were
relevant
here,
it
talks
about
negligence
and
malpractice.
and
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
at
pages
18
to
19,
the
authorities
showing
that
when
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1970,
malpractice
was
thought
to
sweep
very
broadly
to
cover
any
bad
acts,
any
malpractice,
and
so
it
doesn't
operate
--
the
title
here
can't
operate
as
a
limitation
on
the
scope
of
this
provision.
with
respect
to
the
history,
the
one
other
thing
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
i
didn't
get
to
in
my
answer
before
is
another
odd
result
that
you
would
have,
if
you
looked
at
when
bivens
was
decided
and
made
that
your
deciding
factor,
is
that
the
ftca's
judgment
bar,
at
28
u.s.c.
section
2676,
which
was
enacted
in
1948,
which
says
that
when
you
take
a
claim
against
the
united
states
under
the
ftca
all
the
way
to
judgment,
you
are
barred
from
raising
any
other
civil
action
or
proceeding
by
reason
of
the
same
subject
matter.
so
very
similar
language
to
what
we
have
here.
that
wouldn't
bar
bivens
claims,
even
though
every
court
of
appeals
to
have
looked
at
the
issue
has
said
that
it
does
cover
bivens
claims
in
a
different
sense.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
but
the
--
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
it's
the
"any
other
civil
action
or"--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--proceedings
"language
in
the
judgment
bar.
"
"if
you
looked
at
whether
bivens
had
been
decided
yet,
it
wouldn't
cover
bivens
because
the
statute
was
enacted
prior
to
the
time
that
bivens
was
decided.
"
"it
was
enacted
in
1948.
"
"so
it's
not
--
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
make
your
statutory
interpretation,
your
interpretation
of
those
words,
hinge
on
the
fact
that
bivens
had
or
hadn't
been
decided
yet.
"
"if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
"
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
just
two
quick
points,
if
i
may.
one
is
that
i
think
you
can't
read
this
court's
bivens
jurisprudence
to
set
forth
any
kind
of
clear
statement
rule
in
this
context.
in
many
cases
after
carlson
was
decided,
this
court
has
looked
for
indications
that
congress
thought
the
judiciary
should
stay
its
hands,
and
it
has
found
those
indications
in
the
mere
existence
of
some
kind
of
statutory
scheme,
even
where
congress
has
said
nothing
express
about
whether
that
scheme
should
be
exclusive
or
not.
if
it
can
be
the
case
that,
simply
by
setting
forth
an
elaborate
scheme,
congress
can
indicate
its
intent
that
this
particular
implied
cause
of
action
shouldn't
go
forward,
then
it
must
be
true
also
that
where
congress
expressly
says
that
it
shouldn't
go
forward,
that
that
can
be
given
effect.
and
i
point
out
that
there
is
not
a
cutting
off
of
a
constitutional
right
here.
it's
just
that
there
is
a
specific
cause
of
action
that
isn't
going
to
be
allowed
to
go
forward
because
it's
one
that
this
court
would
imply.
secondly,
just
to
go
back
to
my
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
before,
the
case
that
i
meant
to
cite
to
you
was
van
de
kamp
v.
goldstein,
129
supreme
court
855,
and
that
talked
about
absolute
immunity
reflecting
a
balance
of
evils.
here,
i
think
congress
has
done
that
balancing.
congress
has
decided
that
it
would
rather
protect
the
phs,
make
sure
that
causes
of
action
and
liability
aren't
hanging
over
the
heads
of
phs
officers,
even
if
that
means
that
some
individuals
don't
get
recovery
against
certain
specific
phs
personnel
on
their
claims,
when
they
can
of
course
recover
from
the
united
states.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'd
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
be
reversed.
