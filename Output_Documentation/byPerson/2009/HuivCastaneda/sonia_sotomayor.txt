justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
our
job
is
to
determine
congress's
intent
when
it
passed
233(a).
what
we
do
know
is
that
there
was
no
bivens
immunity
at
the
time;
the
ftca
had
only
a
limited
application
under
certain
driver-related
accidents.
so
we
really
don't
have
anything
to
tell
us,
because
they
didn't
even
know
that
there
was
a
constitutional
claim
that
could
be
raised,
what
they
would
have
intended
or
not
intended.
and
i
thought
that
justice
ginsburg's
point
would
be
that
the
westfall
act
tells
us
what
they
intended,
because
by
its
nature
it
applied
to
all
employees
and
didn't
differentiate
among
them,
and
copied
233's
immunity,
so
that
one
can
look
at
it
and
say,
ah,
that
speaks
of
congress's
intent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
other
act
besides
233(a)
that
is
similar--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
gives
separate
immunity?
which
are
those?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
how
many
phs
personnel
work
in
settings
outside
custodial
settings?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
custodial
settings.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
for
the
indian--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
is
there
a
reason
congress
would
want
to
immunize
phs
personnel
against
bivens
claims
in
a
custodial
setting,
but
not
immunize
bureau
of
prison
personnel?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
not
every
doctor
--
if
they
come
under
the
ftca,
they
--
their
--
constitutional
claims
are
not
immunized
against
them--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--unless
they
are
phs
personnel.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
case
arises
from
francisco
castaneda’s
claim
that
petitioners
the
u.s
public
health
service
personnel
repeatedly
denied
him
necessary
medical
treatment,
while
he
was
in
immigration
detention.
immediately
after
his
release
from
detention,
castaneda
was
diagnosed
with
cancer.
he
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court,
raising
medical
negligence
claims
against
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
constitutional
claims
against
petitioners
under
bivens
v.
six
unknown
federal
narcotics
agents.
after
castaneda
died,
respondents
were
substituted
as
plaintiffs.
petitioners
moved
to
dismiss
the
bivens
claims
on
the
grounds
that
42
us
code
section
233(a)
makes
them
immune
from
suit.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
based
on
the
plain
language
of
section
233(a)
we
hold
that
phs
officers
and
employees
are
not
personally
subject
to
bivens
actions
from
harms
arising
out
of
the
conduct
described
in
that
section.
by
making
the
remedy
against
the
united
states
provided
by
the
ftca
“exclusive
of
any
other
civil
action
or
proceeding"
for
harms
resulting
from
the
performance
of
medical
or
related
functions
within
the
scope
of
phs
employment.
section
233(a)
grants
phs
personnel,
absolute
immunity
from
suit
for
harms
arising
from
such
conduct.
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
our
opinion,
we
find
respondent’s
counter
argument
unpersuasive
because
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
section
233(a)
does
not
immunize
petitioners
from
suit
in
these
circumstances.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
that
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
