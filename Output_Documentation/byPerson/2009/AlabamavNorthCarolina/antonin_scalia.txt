justice
antonin
scalia
but
how
much
--
how
much
did
the
commission
give
before
this?
it
just
did
that
out
of
the
goodness
of
its
heart?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
best
indications
of
what
--
what
a
contract
means
is
the
manner
in
which
the
parties
act
under
the
contract,
and
that
suggests
to
me
that
it
was
never
contemplated
that
north
carolina
alone
would
foot
the
bill
for
--
for
obtaining
this
license.
justice
antonin
scalia
were
there
any
benefits
to
the
contract
at
all
until
--
unless
and
until
there
was
a
waste
facility
constructed?
justice
antonin
scalia
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
to
me
pretty
hypothetical.
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
commit
money
and
a
liability
for
failure
to
do
so
in
a
compact
which
says
that
the
state
can
withdraw
at
any
time.
you
talk
about
good
faith
withdrawal.
what
would
be
bad
faith
withdrawal?
north
carolina
simply
says:
it's
no
longer
worth
our
trouble.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
precedent
from
this
court
for
reading
into
a
contract
between
states
an
obligation
of
good
faith?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
they
agree
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
they
are
just
tender-hearted?
i
mean,
even
though
north
carolina
had
an
obligation
to
fund
all
of
it?
they
just
come
forward
and
say:
yes,
extort
us.
i
mean,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
suggest
it's
not
the
power
to
extort;
it's
the
power
to
withdraw.
and
that
power
to
withdraw
suggests
that
there
is
no
absolute
obligation
to
come
up
with
the
funding.
the
two
seem
to
me
so
--
so
inconsistent
with
--
with
one
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
you
can
withdraw
at
any
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
to
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--while
we
are
on
7(c),
i'm
not
clear
on
how
you
are
reading
that
last
section.
is
the
last
phrase
--
"relating
to
the
enactment
of
this
compact.
"
--is
it
your
position
that
that
phrase
is
joined
not
only
with
the
immediately
preceding
words
--
"the
laws
of
the
party
states.
"
relating
to
the
enactment
of
this
compact
--
but
that
it
also
refers
back
to
compliance
with
the
conditions
and
requirements
of
this
compact
relating
to
the
enactment
of
this
compact?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
certainly
isn't
grammatically
compelled,
but
does
it
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
conditions
and
requirements
relating
to
the
enactment
of
the
compact?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
didn't
you
withdraw?
i
mean,
all
this
is
very
good.
you
had
that
absolute
right
to
withdraw,
but
you
didn't
withdraw
in
--
when
was
it
--
'97.
you
went
on
for
2
years,
still
as
a
member
of
the
compact
and
still
subject
to
obligations
under
the
compact.
how
could
it
be
said
that
you
were
taking
all
appropriate
steps?
what
is
the
language
--
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
took
no
steps
at
all.
you
took
zero
steps.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
you
withdraw?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
had
no
benefit
from
the
compact
for
those
2
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
are
not
arguing
impossibility,
though.
i
mean,
the
other
side--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
north
carolina
continue
to
fund
the
authority
during
this
interim
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
didn't
do
nothing
during
this
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
the
authority
still
in
existence,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
they
have
any
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
somebody
has
to
be
keeping
the
authority
alive,
right?
who
did
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
wait,
wait,
wait.
you
said
all
the
commission
funds
were
for
prior
expenditures.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
never
passes
through
the
states,
and
this
provision
just
waves
a
magic
wand
and
says
that
it
represents
the
financial
commitments
of
all
party
states
to
the
commission.
what
proportion
from
each
state?
do
we
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
all
this
means
is
that
that
is
the
only
financial
commitment
that
the
states
are
obliged
to
--
to
make.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can't
be
the
money
of
the
states
if
you
can't
say
how
much
of
it
belongs
to
each
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ability
to
withdraw
terminates
upon
completion
of
the
facility?
justice
antonin
scalia
six
months
afterwards.
so
the
--
the
facility's
completed.
it's
clear
they
are
going
to
have
to
--
they
are
going
to
be
charging
more
than
south
carolina,
which
is
a
lower
cost
facility,
having
been
in
existence
for
longer.
why
wouldn't
everybody
get
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
before
us
pursuant
to
our
original
jurisdiction
over
suits
between
the
states.
in
1986,
congress
granted
its
consent
to
the
southeast
interstate
low-level
radioactive
waste
management
compact
which
originally
had
eight
party
states,
including
north
carolina.
the
compact
is
administered
by
a
commission
which
was
required
among
other
things
to
“identify
a
host
state
for
the
development
of
a
new
regional
facility
for
the
disposal
of
low-level
radioactive
waste."
the
commission
designated
north
carolina
as
a
host
state,
thereby
obligating
it
to
take,
and
this
the
language
of
the
compact,
appropriate
steps
to
ensure
that
an
application
for
a
license
to
construct
and
operate
a
low-level
radioactive
waste
storage
facility
is
filed
with
and
issued
by
the
appropriate
authority.
in
1988,
north
carolina
asked
the
commission
for
assistance
with
the
substantial
costs
of
licensing
and
building
a
facility.
the
commission
adopted
a
resolution
declaring
it
“appropriate
and
necessary”
to
provide
financial
assistance
and
ultimately
paid
almost
$80
million
to
north
carolina
from
1988
through
1997.
the
commission
acquired
that
money
from
fees
paid
by
generators
of
low-level
radioactive
waste
at
the
expend
disposal
facility
in
barnwell,
south
carolina
which
the
new
facility
was
ultimately
supposed
to
replace.
north
carolina
also
expended
$34
million
of
its
own
funds,
yet
by
the
mid
1990s,
north
carolina
was
still
many
years
and
many
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
away
from
obtaining
a
license
and
constructing
a
facility.
in
1997,
the
commission
notified
north
carolina
that
absent
a
plan
for
funding
the
remaining
steps
of
the
licensing
process,
it
would
not
provide
any
additional
funds.
north
carolina
responded
that
it
could
not
continue
without
external
funding.
after
the
parties
fail
to
agree
on
a
financing
plan,
in
december
1997
the
commission
ceased
its
financial
assistance
to
north
carolina
and
north
carolina
ceased
taking
steps
towards
obtaining
a
license.
in
june
1999,
florida
and
tennessee
filed
a
complaint
with
the
commission
seeking
monetary
sanctions
against
north
carolina
and
the
next
month,
north
carolina
withdrew
from
the
compact.
in
december
1999,
the
commission
determined
that
north
carolina
had
failed
to
fulfill
its
obligation
to
take
appropriate
steps
under
the
compact
and
adopted
a
resolution
demanding
that
the
state
repay
the
approximately
$80
million
and
in
addition
pay
other
monetary
penalties.
north
carolina
did
not
comply.
in
2003,
we
granted
the
plaintiffs’
here,
four
states;
alabama,
florida,
tennessee
and
virginia
plus
the
commission
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint
against
north
carolina
under
our
original
jurisdiction.
the
complaint
alleges
claims
of
violation
of
the
state's
rights
under
the
compact
count
one,
breach
of
contract
count
two,
unjust
enrichment
count
three,
promissory
estoppel
count
four
and
money
hadn’t
received
count
five,
[laughter]
and
requests
money
and
other
relief
including
a
declaration
that
north
carolina
is
subject
to
sanctions
and
that
the
commission's
sanctions
resolution
is
valid
and
enforceable.
we
assigned
the
case
to
a
special
master
who
filed
two
reports,
making
recommendations
with
respect
to
each
of
the
foregoing
claims
and
with
respect
to
north
carolina's
motion
to
dismiss
certain
claims
on
grounds
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
parties
fined
nine
exceptions
to
the
master’s
reports.
for
the
reasons
provided
in
our
opinion,
we
overrule
all
of
them.
we
first
conclude
that
the
express
terms
of
the
compact
do
not
authorize
the
commission
to
impose
monetary
sanctions
against
north
carolina
and
since
that
is
so
we
reject
it
as
moot
the
plaintiffs’
argument
that
north
carolina
could
not
avoid
monetary
sanctions
by
withdrawing
from
the
compact
and
we
deem
plaintiffs’
argument
that
north
carolina
forfeited
its
right
to
object
to
monetary
sanctions
abandoned
but
in
any
event
without
merit.
we
also
reject
plaintiffs’
argument
that
we
are
bound
by
or
should
defer
to
the
commission's
conclusion
that
north
carolina
breached
the
compact.
the
terms
of
the
compact
do
not
make
the
commission
the
sole
arbiter
of
disputes
arising
under
it
and
hence
we
are
not
bound
by
the
commission's
conclusion,
nor
do
we
apply
deferential
administrative
law
standards
of
review,
but
instead
as
the
exclusive
arbiter
of
controversies
between
the
states,
we
exercise
our
own
independent
judgment
as
to
both
fact
and
law.
we
further
reject
plaintiffs’
primary
argument
that
north
carolina
breached
its
obligation
under
article
5(c)
of
the
compact
to
take
appropriate
steps
towards
obtaining
a
license.
the
compact
requires
north
carolina
to
take
only
those
licensing
steps
that
are
appropriate.
the
party’s
course
of
performance
establishes
that
it
was
not
appropriate
for
north
carolina
to
proceed
with
a
very
expensive
licensing
process
when
it
had
become
clear
that
it
will
receive
no
further
financial
assistance
for
that
purpose,
and
when
it
appeared
that
even
if
the
license
were
obtained
there
would
be
no
funding
for
construction
of
the
facility.
the
compact
does
not
require
north
carolina
to
cover
all
licensing
and
building
costs
on
its
own.
we
reject
plaintiffs’
argument
that
north
carolina
breached
an
implied
duty
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
when
it
withdrew
from
the
compact
in
june
1999.
we
have
never
held
that
an
interstate
compact
includes
such
a
duty
and
we
decline
to
do
so
here.
the
compact
by
its
terms
imposes
no
limitation
on
south
carolina's
right
to
exercise
its
statutory
right
under
article
7(g)
to
withdraw.
we
also
overrule
north
carolina's
two
exceptions.
it
was
reasonable
for
the
special
master
to
deny
without
prejudice
north
carolina's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
plaintiffs'
equitable
claims
counts
3-5.
the
special
master
concluded
that
those
claims
require
further
briefing,
argument
and
possibly,
discovery.
we
granted
the
special
master,
the
discretion
to
manage
the
proceedings
in
this
case
and
we
approve
of
his
reasonable
case
management
decision.
the
special
master
was
also
correct
to
deny
without
prejudice
north
carolina's
motion
to
dismiss
the
commission's
claims
on
grounds
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
commission
of
course
is
not
a
state
and
hence
cannot
take
advantage
of
the
state's
consent
to
suit
by
other
states
in
this
court
that
the
constitution
contains.
under
a
case
called
arizona
versus
california,
however,
we
held
that
a
non-state
can
join
the
suit
by
states
so
long
as
it
asserts
the
same
claims
and
seeks
the
same
relief.
with
respect
to
counts
1
and
2
the
commission's
claims
under
those
compact
related
counts
are
wholly
derivative
of
the
plaintiff
states'
claims.
counts
3
to
5
however
are
on
a
different
footing.
the
special
master
concluded
that
further
the
factual
and
legal
development
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
commission's
claims
under
those
counts
were
identical
to
those
of
the
plaintiff
states.
we
conclude
the
special
master's
case
management
decision
was
reasonable.
in
sum
we
grant
north
carolina's
motions
to
dismiss
count
1
and
for
summary
judgment
on
count
2.
we
deny
plaintiffs’
motions
for
summary
judgment
on
counts
1
and
2
and
we
deny
without
prejudice
north
carolina's
motions
to
dismiss
the
commission's
claims
on
sovereign
immunity
grounds
and
for
summary
judgment
under
counts
3
to
5.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
sotomayor
has
joined.
