mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
north
carolina
breached
the
southeast
compact
in
this
case.
whether
you
examine
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
sanctions
that
were
imposed
by
the
commission,
or
whether
you
evaluate
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
repeated
statements
by
the
executives
of
the
commission
that
there
had
been
a
material
breach
and
a
repudiation,
or
whether
you
examine
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
undisputed
record
that
was
collected
by
the
special
master,
the
conclusion,
it
seems
to
me,
is
inescapable
that
what
north
carolina
did
here
by
taking
no
action
between
december
1997
and
july
of
1996
simply
does
not
fulfill
the
responsibilities
that
they
had
--
that
north
carolina
had
assumed,
and
therefore
the
only
issue
should
be:
what
is
the
appropriate
remedy
for
this
extraordinary
breach?
to
go
to
the
specific
record,
just
to
be
clear
about
this,
the
special
master
says
at
page
10
of
his
report:
"the
parties
do
not
dispute
that
north
carolina
did
not
take
additional
steps
to
pursue
a
license
for
a
waste
facility
during
that
period.
"
our
undisputed
statement
of
facts
is
that
north
carolina
took
no
further
steps
to
license
between
1997
and
1999.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
north
carolina
assumed
the
responsibility
more
than
a
decade
prior
to
that
time
to
take
all
appropriate
steps
in
order
to
provide
for
licensing
and
for
construction
of
a
facility.
"appropriate
steps"
in
that
context
has
to
mean
something
more
than
simply
doing
nothing,
declaring
categorically
that
you
are
going
to
repudiate
the
agreement,
and
attempting
to
extort
from
the
compact
and
its
commission
additional
monies
that
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
commission
has
no
responsibility
to
north
carolina
to
pay.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it
did
it
with
--
with
the
approval
of
the
other
states
in
the
compact,
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
--
of
the
contract--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
language
of
the
--
of
the
compact
itself,
justice
scalia,
is
quite
plain.
it's
clear
that
the
commission
has
no
responsibility
to
create
--
to
pay
for
the
creation
of
this
--
of
this
facility.
that
was
clear
from
day
one.
north
carolina,
not
only
in
its
legislation
authorizing
its
authority,
but
also
its
governor
repeatedly
saying,
we
understand
that
we
have
a
responsibility
to
create
this
facility,
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--at
whatever
cost--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
would
say
that
the
--
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
would
have
--
have
a
defense
of
impossibility
if
they
could
argue
that
going
down
this
path
would
have
bankrupted
north
carolina.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
but
the
--
but
the
payment
of
$80
million
by
the
commission
was
way
above
what
any
of
the
parties
expected
at
the
beginning
of
the
process
as
well.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
was
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
construction
of
the
facility
itself
would
have
cost
an
additional
$75
million.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
probably
34
million
to
complete
the
license.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
the
--
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure,
but
the
--
but
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
know
that
there
were
any
initial
estimates,
at
least
that
i
recall.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
doubt
that
that
would
have
included
the
full
construction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
north
carolina
--
first
of
all,
north
carolina
never
did
assert
a
right
of
impossibility.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
said
it
wouldn't
complete
this
project.
it
imposed
upon
us
and
unilaterally
imposed
upon
the
other
states
to
the
compact
the
obligation
to
fund,
an
obligation
none
of
them
had
--
had
assumed
under
the
contract.
to
be
sure,
they
had
provided
moneys
to
north
carolina
with
the
expectation
that
north
carolina
would
use
those
moneys
ultimately
to
build
a
project.
but
the
reality
is
in
1997,
in
december,
north
carolina
unilaterally
declared
that
they
were
not
going
to
complete
the
project
and
that
they
were
going
to
take
no
actions
further
--
in
furtherance--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
our
argument
is
that
--
you
know,
whether
--
you
know--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
there's
an
open
question
of
whether
the
withdrawal
in
'97
would
have
been
in
good
faith
or
not.
that
would
be
a
separate
issue.
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
one
thing
that
a
contracting
party
does
not
have
the
right
to
do
is
to
unilaterally
decide
to
repudiate
the
agreement,
get
the
benefit
of
the
agreement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
and
--
and
the
question
then,
obviously,
that
--
the
legal
issue
that
that
presents
is
whether
or
not
a
party
to
a
contract
who
is
not
entitled
to
expect
the
other
participants
to
the
agreement
to
pay
any
more
money
or
in
fact
any
money
whatsoever
has
the
authority
essentially
to
attempt
to
extort
that
money
while
continuing
to
gain
the
benefits
of
the
contract
for
an
additional
year
and
a
half;
at
that
point,
then
they
--
then
they
withdraw.
we
can
debate
about
whether
the
withdrawal
was
in
good
faith
or
not.
but
the
bottom
line
is
there
is
no
substantial
difference
between
the
repudiation
and
the
complete
disregard
of
the
contractual
obligations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
benefits
of
being
a
part
of
the
compact
is
all
of
the
powers
that
the
commission
had
to
deal
with
other
compacts
in
terms
of
how
to
license
--
not
how
to
license,
but
how
to
dispose
of
waste.
they
got
all
of
the
benefits
of
being
a
part
of
a
compact
during
the
entirety
of
that
period.
so,
you
know,
it
was
not
in
their
interest
to
repudiate
this
agreement
or
to
withdraw
from
it
until
they
got
to
the
point
where
they
were
--
where
they
recognized
that
they
were
about
to
be
sanctioned
for
their
failure
to
comply
with
their
responsibilities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
were
huge
benefits,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
barnwell
facility
in
south
carolina
was
disposing
of
waste
and
was
only
going
to
take
wastes
from
the
compact
states
in
the
southeast
compact.
so
north
carolina
had
--
had
ample
access
to
that
south
carolina
facility
that,
if
it
had
never
joined
the
compact,
it
never
would
have
had
available
to
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
1995,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
they
still
had
the
benefit
of
the
compact's
--
the
commission's
authority
to
negotiate
on
behalf
of
the
member
states
deals
with
other
compacts
for
the
disposal
in
those
facilities
which
you
otherwise
don't
have
the
benefit
of.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
this
would
be
bad
faith
withdrawal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
where
the
state
assumes
--
accepts
$80
million,
goes
down
a
path,
is
not
entitled
to
any
of
that
money
or
to
any
other
money,
and
then
unilaterally
withdraws--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
an
open
issue
at
this
point.
we
haven't
analyzed
that.
that's
part
of
what
i
think
what
would
be
involved
with
the
last
three
counts
of
the
--
of
the
complaint.
we
don't
know
exactly
whether
that
money
was
properly
spent
or
not.
but
--
but
either
way,
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that,
even
if
it
were
not,
quote
80
million?
is
it
the
six
members
of
the
compact
today?
no.
it's
north
carolina.
if
the
--
if
the
federal
government
were
to
declare
tomorrow,
in
response
to
some
terrorist
problem,
that
on-site
storage
of
low-level
nuclear
waste
is
no
longer
permissible
and
that
those
wastes
have
got
to
be
disposed
of
somewhere
other
--
in
some
other
kind
of
a
facility,
the
state
that
is
--
other
than
texas,
which
is
about
to
start
one
up,
but
the
state
that's
clearly
in
the
best
position
to
do
that
today
is
north
carolina.
why?
because
they
have
got
a
$134
million
jump
on
everybody,
$80
million
the
benefit
of
which
was
conferred
by
the
commission
and
the
compact
and
the
sister
states
that
were
a
part
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
--
i
think
if
--
it
would
be
a
tougher
case
if
they
had
taken
the
80
million
and
come
to
the
conclusion
of
this
and
there
was
a
finding
by
the
state
authorities
that
this
facility
simply
cannot
be
built
consistent
with
health
and
safety.
i
think
that
would
be
an
argument
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
the
money
back.
but
what
i
think
you
are
not
entitled
to
do,
as
north
carolina,
is
to
decide
unilaterally
that
more
money
should
be
paid,
which
is
not
provided
for
under
the
agreement,
and
insist
on
that
as
a
condition
of
fulfilling
any
of
its
responsibilities
under
the
agreement.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
i
mean,
well,
the
working
assumption
is
that
the
facilities
would
be
in
operation
for
20
years.
and
the
reality,
justice
alito,
is
that
once
you
have
one
of
these
facilities
built,
given
that
there
are
not
very
many
of
them
and
they
are
and
would
be
a
monopoly
within
the
compact
region,
you
have
virtually
limited
--
unlimited
authority
to
dictate
whatever
price
you
want
to
require
for
taking
on
the
disposal.
and
if
you
look
at
the
sites
that
exist
--
it
was
true
in
barnwell;
it's
certainly
true
in
utah
and
in
washington
--
i
mean,
those
are
licenses
to
print
money,
essentially,
at
this
point.
and
the
expectation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
none
so
far.
texas
i
think
is
as
--
is
as
far
along
in
its
process
as
--
as
anyone,
and
it's
--
and
it's
part
of
a
compact.
but
you
know,
obviously
there
is
a
"not
in
my
backyard"
mentality
here.
but
the
--
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
fundamental
question
remains,
you
know,
what
--
who
bears
the
responsibility?
north
carolina
--
it
wasn't
as
though
north
carolina
was
the
unfortunate
recipient
of
this
particular
decision
and
then
said,
you
know,
we
don't
want
to
do
this,
we
can't
pay
for
this,
there's
no
way
we
can
accomplish
this.
north
carolina,
after
having
been
designated
as
the
host
state,
affirmatively
passed
legislation
accepting
that
responsibility
and
committing
the
state
to
actually
providing
for
a
facility.
now,
justice
stevens,
i
agree,
if
it
had
turned
out
that
as
a
matter
of
public
health
and
safety
--
that's
the
big
bugaboo
here
--
if
that
had
been
an
obstacle,
or
maybe,
justice
sotomayor,
if
the
expense
had
been
so
far
out
of
the
range
of
what's
conceivable,
maybe
there's
an
impossibility
element
to
it.
but
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
course.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
the
only
thing
--
there
is
nothing
express
in
the
contract,
in
the
compact,
that
would
prevent
them
from
doing
that.
i
do
think
there
is
an
implied
duty
of
good
faith.
but
in
the
situation
you
pose,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
they
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
other
than
--
other
than
the
fact
that
to
say
"we
can't"
strikes
me
as
utterly
implausible.
to
say
"we
don't
want
to"
strikes
me
as
much
more
arguable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
the
problem
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
the
problem
--
what
turns
it
into
bad
faith
is
taking
the
80
million,
consistently
committing
to
going
forward
with
it,
and
then
walking
away
right
before
you
are
going
to
get
sanctioned
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
--
with
the
agreement.
i
think
those
are
the
elements
that
make
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
have
any
--
any
decision
of
this
court.
i
do
have
an
opinion
by
the
d.c.
circuit
some
years
ago
that
says
that
every
contract
carries
with
it
an
implied
duty
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing.
you
may
remember
that
opinion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
only
--
the
only
argument
we
have
with
respect
to
that
--
and
it's
important
to
recognize,
we
don't
have
to
win
this
issue
in
order
to
win
the
breach
of
contract
claim
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
there's
massive
repudiation
long
before
the
--
the
question
still
is,
what
do
you
do
with
1997
to
1999?
before
they
withdraw,
they
have
repudiated
the
agreement.
they
have
breached
it
totally.
the
very
essence
of
the
agreement
was
lost
once
north
carolina
refused
to
take
any
steps,
much
less
appropriate
steps.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
take
--
well,
what
they
are
supposed
to
do
is
take
appropriate
steps
to
license,
which
means--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--continue
to
do
what's
necessary
to
get
a
license.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
that
there
is
specific
authority
for
that
proposition.
but,
justice
breyer,
it
seems
to
me
what
you
describe
there
is
exquisitely
close
to
what
this
--
what
this
court
resolved
in
mobil
oil
exploration,
where
congress
passed
a
statute
saying
that
the
administrative
side
would
not
be
permitted
to
go
forward,
and
this
court
said
that
action
constituted
a
repudiation
of
the
underlying
obligation,
even
though
it
was
far
from
clear
that
there
would
ever
be
any
exploration
or
production
of
oil
on
this
--
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
sites
that
were
in
there.
this
court
said
that
when
--
that
if
an
obligor
will
commit
a
breach
that
would
of
itself
give
the
obligee
a
claim
for
damages
for
total
breach,
so
that
it
so
substantially
impairs
the
value
of
the
contract,
and
the
government
said
it
would
break
or
did
break
an
important
contractual
promise,
impairing
the
value
of
the
contract,
then
the
government
must
give
the
companies
back
the
money.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
think
that's
a
fair--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
we
have
other
arguments,
obviously,
but
then
--
but
on
the
breach--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
should
win.
in
my
judgment,
that's
--
the
conduct
of
north
carolina
between
1997
and
1999
is
exactly
the
same
conduct
that
the
united
states
entered
into
in
mobil
exploration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
it's
a--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
believe
that
they
are
the
sole
judge,
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
article
7(c).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
okay.
that's
in
the
--
that
will
be
in
the
sanctions
order
that's
in
the
appendix,
so
that
--
in
the
record.
i
think
it's
around
page
400.
i
will
get
that
for
you,
justice
breyer.
but
the
specific
finding
is
that
north
carolina
had
a
duty
to
go
forward
and
--
and
stopped
completely.
it
repudiated.
in
addition
to
that,
when
north
carolina
announced
that
it
was
shutting
down
the
project
and
that
it
was
not
going
forward,
that
it
was
just
going
to
run
out
and
wait
and
hope,
frankly,
that
additional
funding
would
come
forward,
the
--
the
compact
--
the
director
of
the
compact
specifically
wrote
to
the
governor
twice,
saying:
these
are
acts
in
repudiation
and
in
violation
of
the
agreement;
it
is
your
responsibility.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
refused,
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
basic
proposal
--
the
draft
memorandum
of
understanding
would
have
--
would
have
led
to
the
commission
providing,
i
think,
about
$21
million,
and
the
generators
in
the
southeast
states
providing
a
loan
to
north
carolina
of
an
additional
--
i
think
it
was
$13
million.
and
that
gets
you
the
$34
million
--
comes
from
--
for
the
--
for
the
finalized
elements
of
getting
a
license
put
in
place.
so
we
had
--
you
know,
we
thought
we
had
in
place
an
offer
to
fund.
i
mean,
that's
what
makes
north
carolina--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
might
want
to
ask
mr.
dellinger
that
question.
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
provide
us
with
any
explanation
for
why
they
didn't-why
they
turned
that
down.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
that
would
have
been
a
loan
for
the
future.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
everybody
on
our
side
had
agreed
to
that,
including
the
--
the
other
members
of
the
compact.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
you
know,
when
you
--
when
you've
got
the
power
to
extort,
you
know,
the
temptation
to
go
down
that
path,
justice
scalia,
is
obviously
pretty
strong.
and
the
reason
they
did
it
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
difficulty--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
remember,
you
are
talking
now
also
about
the
commission
and
the
other
compact
states
having
sunk
$80
million
in
the
investment
to
get
this
site
up
and
running.
so
we've
--
i
mean,
we've
already
got
$80
million
in
the
hole.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
our
position
would
be
exactly
the
same.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
--
you
know,
of
course,
is:
what's
the
appropriate
remedy
for
the
particular
breach
in
any
given
case?
in
this
context,
if
we
were
talking
about
a
couple
thousand
dollars--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
i
--
well,
i
think
the
ultimate
question
is
still:
what
is
the
obligation?
and
justice
breyer
identified
it,
i
think,
quite
precisely.
and
again,
this
is
only
with
respect
to
count
2
in
that
breach
claim.
but
our
argument
there
is
that
they
had
a
responsibility
from
december
1997
until
july
of
1999
to
take
appropriate
steps.
and
they
massively
repudiated
that
obligation
and
repudiated
the
entirety
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
the
contract.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
subject
to
what
i
would
think
was
a
duty
of
good
faith,
they
could
have
done
that.
but
they
didn't
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
think
it's
more
subtle
than
that,
justice
sotomayor.
i
mean,
my
point
is
they
always
had
an
obligation
to
take
appropriate
steps
to
get
licensed.
that
was
an
obligation
that
lasted
until
they
withdrew.
and
from
--
from
december
1997
on,
they
refused
to
take
any
steps
toward
getting
a
license.
and
we
don't
know
today
whether
something
could
have
happened
in
that
year
and
a
half
that
might
have
changed
the
entire
dynamic
of
this
and
allowed
it
to
in
fact
be
completed
in
a
way
that
all
of
the
parties
would
have
been
satisfied
with.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
of
course.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it's
a
pure
legal
argument.
i
think
we
have
put
forward
everything
before
the
special
master
that
we
think
is
relevant
for
the
--
for
a
disposition
of
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
the
bill
of
complaint
itself
doesn't
distinguish
between
claims
based
on
any
particular
party.
they
list
the
parties
and
they
list
the
claims,
and
there
is
no
effort
to
mix
and
match
as
between
them.
in
terms--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
would
think
at
a
minimum
we
are
very
much
like
the
private
oil
companies
in
the
maryland
v.
louisiana
case,
in
any
event,
where,
you
know,
the
claims
were
out
there;
it
was
far
from
clear
exactly
how
those
claims
were
going
to
play
out
in
one
way
or
another.
and
this
court
didn't
sit
down
and
say:
we
have
to
sort
that
out
ahead
of
going
forward
with
the
litigation.
what
the
court
said
was:
these
all
look
to
be
pretty
close
and
there's
no
basis
on
which
to
assume
that
they
are
doing
more
--
that
they
are
asking
for
more,
and
therefore
there's
no
eleventh
amendment
problem.
and,
of
course,
remember
the
special
master
has
held
open
the
possibility
that
if
for
some
reason
the
claims
of
the
commission
were
to
deviate
from
the
claims
of
--
of
any
of
the
compact
states,
which
as
far
as
i
can
tell
to
this
point
they
have
--
they
have
not
deviated
one
iota,
then
the
special
master
would
allow
north
carolina
to
revisit
--
to
renew
its
motion
at
that
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that
--
it
seems
to
me,
justice
sotomayor,
what
you
are
doing
there
is
collapsing
the
question
on
the
merits
into
the
jurisdictional
issue
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
although--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
although
this
--
this
court
has
also
recognized
in
georgia
v.
united
states,
for
instance,
that
if
--
if
there
are
clearly
claims
that
exist,
that
are
legitimately
litigable,
notwithstanding
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
there
may
be
some
question
about
others,
that
the
court
nevertheless
should
go
forward
and
figure
out--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--which
ones
work
and
which
ones
don't.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
--
just
as
the
special
master
said,
it's
premature
to
try
to
judge
that
until
we
get
to
a
point
in
the
litigation
where
it
becomes
clear
that
there
is
some
departure
between
what
the
states
are
doing
and
what
the
commission
is
doing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
get--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
the
commission
is
asking
for
the
money
on
behalf
of
the
--
of
the
compact
states,
and
the
compact
states
are
asking
for
the
money
on
their
own
behalf.
i
do
think
it's
an
easier
vehicle
for
the
court
to
be
able
to
provide
a
remedy
by
giving
money
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
number
of
the
points
that
have
been
made.
it
seems
to
me
the
most
fundamental
one
that
mr.
dellinger
relies
upon
is
the
notion
that
this
$80
million
was
not
the
money
of
the
compact
states,
and
he
--
he
keeps
saying
that
repeatedly
--
you
know,
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
money
doesn't
come
through
the
treasury
of
the
states.
but
he
ignores,
on
12a,
article
4(h)(2)(b),
which
says,
with
respect
to
the
levying
of
the
special
fees
or
surcharges,
which
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
entirety
of
the
$80
million
comes,
that
this
must
represent
the
financial
commitments
of
all
party
states
to
the
commission.
it
was
the
understanding
that,
in
exercising
the
authority
to
levy
these
amounts
of
money
in
order
to
generate
this,
that
that
was
the
states'
money,
all
of
the
states'
money,
and
ultimately,
if
this
court
would
have
determined
that
the
money--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
says
each
state
hosting-you
know,
"shall
annually
levy
surcharges".
the
total
of
those
surcharges
represent
the
financial
commitments
of
all
of
the
party
states
to
the
commission.
that
seems
to
me
to
say
that
it
is
the
commitment
of
the
party
states
that's
--
that's
being
provided
for
in
that
context.
it's
not
the
money
of
the
commission.
it's
not
the
money
of
the
generators.
it's
the
money
of
the
compact
states
that's
being
used
for
whatever
purpose
is
necessary
in
order
to
fulfill
the
overall
objectives
of
the
compact.
in
this
context,
it
was
used
to
ask
north
carolina
to
go
forward
to
site
a
facility.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
don't
know,
and
we
wouldn't
--
and
the
truth
is,
at
the
end--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
there's
no
question
that
it
--
that
it
can
be
read
as
--
as
saying
that,
which,
of
course,
then
tells
you,
if
it's
not
the
commission's
responsibility
and
it's
not
the
states'
responsibility,
then
it
was
clearly,
from
the
outset
and
has
always
been,
north
carolina's.
but
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that,
justice
scalia.
i
think
it
actually
tells
you,
as
an
agreement
among
all
of
the
party
states
to
this
compact,
that
this
is
the
money
of
the
states,
and
ultimately--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
no.
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
would
be
a
way
to
allocate
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
--
that
either
the
commission,
based
on
the
vote
of
the
parties
--
the
party
states,
could
either
allocate
it
back
on
a
pro
rata
basis,
or
they
can
do
it
on
the
basis
of
the
percentage
of
the
--
of
the
waste
that
was
used
in
any
particular
fund.
there's
no
specific
provision
on
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
doesn't
detract,
justice
scalia,
from
the
fundamental
point
that
what
the
compact
members
agreed
upon
was
that
this
money
would
be
the
money
of
all
of
the
states.
and,
therefore,
we
can't
keep
it
as
a
commission.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
south
carolina,
in
this
particular
context.
the
--
immediately,
it
would
be
south
carolina,
and
ultimately,
then
--
assuming
north
carolina
or
another
state
were
to
site
a
facility,
then,
from
there
on,
that
money
would
continue
to
be
their
commitment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
because
the
compact
agreed
among
themselves,
as
part
of
this
agreement,
that
the
--
that
they
would
have
authority
to
impose
those
surcharges
on
the
generators,
as
they
brought
the
money
in.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
they
could
have,
actually.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no,
but
i
--
through
their
membership,
they
certainly
did.
if
the
states
agreed
to
disband
the
compact
and
the
--
the
commission
disappears
and
there's
$80
million
in
the
pot,
that
money's
going
somewhere.
it's
not
staying
in
--
it
may
get
paid
for
legal
fees,
but
other
than
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean,
in
terms
as
a
percentage
off
the
--
off
the
normal
charges?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that
would
be
a
bit
high.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
the
generator
does.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
represents
the
commitment
of
the
states.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
all
that's
saying
is
that
that
money,
even
though
that
--
i
mean,
the
alternative
way
to
do
it,
obviously--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
then
it
comes
to
the
commission--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
the
commission
then
used
it
in
this
context.
but
that's
the
basic
point,
justice
breyer.
if
they
didn't
have
this
provision,
you
would
--
you
might
assume
it
was
the
generators'
money
or
somebody
else's
money.
the
whole
point
of
this
provision
was
to
say
these
moneys,
which
can
only
be
levied
because
of
the
compact
and
the
commission's
authority,
remain
the
responsibility
of
the
states
and,
ultimately,
to
my
mind
at
least,
would
clearly
go
back
to
them.
justice
breyer,
i
wanted
to
answer
your
question
with
respect
to
findings
of
breach.
january
'98,
there
is
--
the
joint
supplemental
appendix,
page
55,
makes
the
--
is
the
commission
sanction
order,
and
april
'99
--
and,
again,
at
appendix
323
and
appendix
412
--
those
are
specific
findings
by
the
commission
that
there
have
been
breaches.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i'm
relying
on
this
provision
of
the
compact
that
says
it
is
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--then
we
have
an
agency
theory
as
well.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
yes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
--
i
think
that
the
court
--
yes,
i
think
the
court
would
still
have
the
authority,
even
in
dealing
with
what
is
the
appropriate
rule
of
restitution,
because
we
are
too
far
away
from
that
at
this
stage.
we're
not
--
we're
not
there.
but
i
think,
if
the
court
finds
that
north
carolina
breached
the
compact,
it
ought
to
try
to
find
a
reasonable
way
to
remedy
that
particular
problem,
even
if
the
technical
standards
didn't
apply.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no,
justice
sotomayor,
you
do
do
that.
i
mean,
when
the
court
in
kansas
v.
colorado
was
trying--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
seems
to
me
the
court
still
has
the
authority,
in
deciding
what
is
the
appropriate
standard
of
restitution
in
a
problem
as
unique
as
this
one,
to
do
what
it
did
in
kansas
v.
colorado,
which
is
to
say:
how
do
we
measure
the
damages
to
this
party?
let's
look
at
what
the
injury
was
to
the
farmers
who
were
completely
unrelated
to
it.
they
clearly
wouldn't
--
they
weren't
parties
to
that
litigation,
and
the
court
said
that's
a
perfectly
legitimate
way
to
figure
out
the
right
damages.
so
i
think
we
would
still
have
an
argument
that
you
--
that
the
court
would
have
the
authority
to
grant
that
form
of
restitution
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
dellinger
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
what
strikes
me
as
sort
of
a
complete
fantasy
with
respect
to
the
funding
situation
that
north
carolina
faced.
you
know,
once
south
carolina
left,
to
be
sure,
we
lost
the
ability
to
take
money
and
help
north
carolina.
but
the
notion
that
north
carolina,
if
it
had
completed
this
facility,
was
not
going
to
have
a
license
to
print
money
in
the
--
in
going
forward
and
that
funding
wouldn't
have
been
available
back
in
those
days
is
not
in
the
record.
and,
frankly,
it's
completely
counterintuitive,
because
they
have
a
monopoly.
that's
what
the
compact
specifically
provides
for
them,
is
the
monopoly
to
be
able
to
control
the
fees
that
--
on
these
particular
wastes.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
six
months
afterwards.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the
risk
that
south
carolina
is
going
to
pull
up
stakes
and
stop
because
it's
been
making
that
noise
from
the
beginning
--
that
was
the
reason
for
the
crisis.
washington
and
south
carolina
said:
we're
not
going
to
take
every
other
--
every
other
state's
waste,
and
we
are
getting
out
of
this
business.
so
the
risk
you
would
take
in
jumping
out
in
the
six
months
is
that
you
then
find
out
at
the
back
end
you
have
no
place
to
dispose
of
your
waste.
so
the
reality
is,
they
had
--
all
of
the
incentives
to
go
forward
existed
as
much
in
1997
as
they
did
in
1995,
as
they
did
in
1999.
the
only
thing
that's
fundamental
here
is
they
had
a
responsibility
not
just
to
do
what
was
appropriate;
it
was
to
do
what
was
appropriate
to
get
a
license,
and
that's
what
they
never
did.
they
walked
away.
they
took
no
action.
trying
to
negotiate
funding
in
the
abstract
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
moving
forward
to
get
a
license.
on
that
score,
the
authority
shut
down
and
closed.
justice
sotomayor,
you
asked:
is
there
any
benefit
that
remains?
well,
the
reality
is,
geology
studies
and
hydrology
studies
that
get
done,
those
things
don't
change
for
a
billion
years.
so
every
one
of
those
studies
that
was
done
is
going
to
be
just
as
valid
today
12
years
later,
although
i
do
think
the
right
way
to
analyze
this
is
not
in
terms
of
12
years
later,
but
what
would
have
happened
at
the
time.
i
thank
your
honors.
