justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
what
cost?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
the
special
master
said
was,
i
believe,
that
there
was
never
an
obligation
to
do
it
at
all
costs.
they
didn't
have
to
bankrupt
their
treasury
to
do
this;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
accept
that
as
a
working
proposition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
think
there
was
certainly
a
significant
amount
of
evidence
that
the
cost
of
completing
this
project
was
way
above
any
reasonable
expectation
of
the
parties
at
the
time
of
contracting,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
--
what
do
you
believe
the
evidence
shows
with
respect
to
the
reasonable
cost
of
completing
this
project?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
about
a
--
an
additional
34,000
to
get
the
license?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke.
so
over
$100
million?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
an
amount
equal
to
what
they
had
already
--
everybody
had
already
put
in?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
about
how
many
times
greater
than
the
initial
estimates?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
it
was
about
20
or
30
million
dollars
was
initially
estimated
to-to
do
this
project.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i'm
only
going
through
these
to
try
to
get
a
sense
from
you
of
at
what
point
did
north
carolina
have
a
right
to
claim
impossibility?
you
are
saying
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
it
did
by
saying,
we
can't
complete
this
project.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
interrupt
just
a
moment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
they
hadn't
taken
the
80
million.
let's
assume
they
had
sunk
all
of
that
money
themselves--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
they
looked
and
said:
it's
going
to
take
us
another
120
million
to
complete
this;
we
just
can't.
what
in
the
compact
stopped
them
from
withdrawing?
because
the
only
provision
i
see
in
the
contract
about
withdrawing
is
the
one
that
says
once
the
facility
is
completed--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
have
to
keep
--
you
have
to
give
notice,
four-year
notice.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right,
okay.
so
assuming
they
are
acting
in
good
faith,
i
still
don't
quite
understand
what
the
difference
is
except
the
fact
that
they
took
what
you've
described
in
other
counts
as
an
unjust
enrichment.
you
got
us
to
give
you
some
money
to
help
you
along
in
this
project.
but
the
situation
hasn't
changed.
we
can't
spend
more
money.
we
certainly
can't
spend
the
amount
of
money
it
will
take
to
complete
this
project.
i'm
not
sure
what
turns
that
into
bad
faith,
other
than
your
claim
that
they--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
but
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
before
you
described
as
good
faith:
just
too
much
money.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
turns
it
into
bad
faith?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
--
my
problem
remains--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--with
that
answer,
is
that
you
earlier
said
that
they
could
--
forgetting
if
they
didn't
take
any
money
--
under
the
terms
of
this
compact
--
and
justice
scalia
has
been
noting
this
repeatedly
--
have
withdrawn
at
any
time
because
they
didn't
want
to
sink
any
more
money
into
this
project;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
let's
put
aside
that
duty
of
good
faith--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
with
that
duty
of
good
faith,
you're
suggesting
that
merely
because
they
took
a
million
--
that's
what
the
chief
justice
is
asking
you
--
or
80
million,
that
that
somehow
converted
or
changed
the
express
terms
of
the
contract
and
bound
them
in
some
way
to
find
funding
that
they
chose
not
to.
that
--
that's
really
the
argument
i'm
hearing
you
make.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
on
the
sovereign
immunity
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
factual
development
that
needs
to
occur
before
the
special
master
to
address
the
legal
questions
that
have
been
presented?
and
i
see
the
legal
questions
as
whether
or
not,
in
fact,
the
claim
belongs
to
the
commission
or
to
the
states
for
the
$80
million
and
the
$10
million
in
lost
revenue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
factual
development
that
needs
to
occur,
or
is
that
a
pure
legal
question
based
on
the
arguments
that
are
contained
in
the
briefs
before
us?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
there
an
obligation
before
we
exercise
original
jurisdiction
to
ensure
that
there
is
at
least
a
potential
viable
claim
by
the
states
that
they
have
a
cause
of
action?
i
mean,
that
then
becomes
a
legal
question.
is
the
compact
--
is
the
commission
an
agent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
the
states
own
these
revenues?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
suggesting
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
we
do
that
all
the
time,
for
example,
with
--
with
sovereign
immunity.
we--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--we
tell
district
courts
when
there
is
a
sovereign
immunity
issue,
do
the
--
whatever
discovery
you
need
on
the
question,
but
address
it,
because
it's
jurisdictional.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
has
to
be
a
basis
for
the
claim.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
--
i'm
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
don't
question
that
the
states
may
have
some
legitimate
claims.
the
question
is
do
they
have
legitimate
claims
to
what
the
commission
is
seeking.
i
think
that's
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
ask
you,
what
is
the
policy
advantage
of
the
rule
you
are
proposing
with
respect
to
the
first
question,
the
joinder
of
the
commission
in
this
original
action,
of
us
proceeding
to
answer
substantive
questions
about
the
interpretation
of
the
compact,
et
cetera,
without
addressing
initially
the
right
of
the
commission
to
bring
this
action
as
an
original
action
at
all?
it
seems
to
be
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse,
or
--
because
i'm
not
sure
why
we
should
be
reaching
the
merits,
deciding
the
merits,
before
identifying
which
are
the
parties
and
what
claims
they
have
before
us.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
one
won't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
did
that
help
the
other
compacting
states,
giving
them
the
$80
million
and
north
carolina
walking
away?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
hard-pressed
to
understand
where
that
comes
from.
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
--
the
compact,
the
compact
expressly
says
that
none
of
the
contracting
states
have
any
liabilities
with
respect
to
this--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
all
of
this
money
that
has
been
spent
or
was
spent
up
until
1999
--
has
it
been
washed
away?
meaning
--
and
this
may
be
what
remains
for
the
unjust
enrichment
claims,
but
is
there
any
value
left
to
what
occurred?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there's
no
facility--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
provision
just
says
the
states
don't
have
to
give
anything
more
than
that,
that
that's
what
satisfies
whatever
obligations
they
may
or
may
have.
but
where
does
it
say
that
money
belongs
to
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
just
understand
--
and
i
don't
know
if
i
am
missing
something
--
your
theory
that
this
belongs
to
the
states
relies
exclusively
on
either
an
agency
or
an
ownership
theory
as
alternatives?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there's
nothing
else
that
would
make
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
--
that's
--
if
we
disagree
with
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--all
right.
and
then
we
have
to
address
that.
is
there
any
other
theory
that
would
give
the
states
the
right
to
make
the
claims
the
commission
is
making?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
for
the
return
of
the
$80
million.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
don't
do
that,
what
are
you
left
with?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
already
posed
a
hypothetical.
don't
--
if
we
don't,
what
is
left
of
this
case?
