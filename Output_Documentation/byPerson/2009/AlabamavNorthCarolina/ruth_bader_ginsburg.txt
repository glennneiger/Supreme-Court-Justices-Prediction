justice

bader

mr.
phillips,
the
point
that
north
carolina
makes
is
it
would
be
throwing
away
the
taxpayers'
money
to
no
purpose.
that
is,
what
is
the
point
of
continuing
to
pursue
a
license
when
north
carolina
does
not
have
the
funding
to
continue
the
process
and
to
open
the
disposal
facility?
so
north
carolina's
point
of
view
is:
what
does
it
mean
to
continue
to
seek
the
license
when
they
are
not
going
to
have
the
money
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
your
argument
is
then
that
they
acted
2
years
too
late.
when
they
gave
notice
that
they
were
not
able
to
go
forward,
but
they
were
going
to
keep
this
thing
going,
so
if
the
funds
should
somehow
become
available,
they
would
have
the
--
they
would
have
things
still
in
place.
they
wouldn't
have
terminated
the
effort.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
they
had
done
everything
the
same--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they
told
you
what-it
was
totally
up-front.
they
said:
look,
we
can't
go
forward
with
this.
we
haven't
got
the
money.
we'll
let
everything
sit,
to
see
if
someone
will
come
up
with
the
money.
that's
--
it's
--
you
paint
a
picture
of
repudiating
the
contract,
when
north
carolina
gave
notice
in
'97
that
it
would
have
to
fold
if
it
didn't
get
the
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
were
the
benefits
that
north
carolina
was
getting
by
paying
whatever
it
was
--
400-odd
thousand
dollars
--
to
keep
it
going
for
another
2
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
what
point
did
south
carolina
withdraw?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
they
--
by
1997,
they
didn't
have
any
access
to
barnwell
anymore.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
--
but
in
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--case
of
this
compact
and
the
other
ones,
as
i
--
do
i
understand
correctly,
mr.
phillips,
that
none
of
these
--
none
of
these
compacts
that
were
negotiated
around
the
same
time,
none
of
them
yielded
a
disposal
--
an
operative
disposal
facility?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
also
--
you
said
--
you
said
in
your
brief
that
the
--
in
1997,
the
commission
came
forward
with
some
kind
of
additional
funding
proposal,
which
north
carolina
came
down
--
turned
down.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
was
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
did
--
why
did
north
carolina
turn
it
down?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
there
was
a
package,
that
there
was
a
--
an
offer
in
place
where
the
commission
would
pay
x
and
the
generators
would
kick
in
an
additional
amount
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
--
that
--
everybody
had
signed
--
everybody
who
was
part
of
that
offer
had
signed
onto
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
--
mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kneedler,
do
we
have
any
decision
that
deals
with
the
standing
of
a
commission
to
sue
a
state
in
its
own
right?
or
this
is
a
novel
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
relying
on
the
caption
to
article
7
--
"eligible
parties;
withdrawal;
revocation;
entry
into
force;
termination?
"
the
caption
to
article
7?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dellinger,
what
of-what
of
mr.
phillips's
argument
that
that
$80
million
gave
north
carolina
a
leg
up,
should
there
ever
be
any
revival
of
the
development
of
a
disposal
facility;
north
carolina
is
much
better
situated
than
anyone
else
to
do
this,
because
they
have
already
sunk
$80,000
into
pursuing
a
license?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
how
did
it
come
about
that
the
right
to
withdraw
any
time
until
the
second
plant
was
operable,
was
that
--
that
was
north
carolina's
proposal
after
it
was
designated
to
be
the
site?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dellinger,
your
brief
makes
--
i
think
the
reply
brief
made
some
reference
to
north
carolina's
attempting
to
get
funding
from
another
source
after
barnwell
--
the
revenues
from
barnwell
were
no
longer
available
to
it.
i
think,
in
--
in
your
reply
brief,
you
make
some
reference
to
an
effort
on
north
carolina's
part
to
get
--
what
--
what
was
that
effort?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
offer
--
what
about
the
offer
that
mr.
phillips
brought
up,
said
commission
was
ready
to
pay
another
$21
million,
and
there
was
going
to
be
loans
from
the
generators?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
in
--
hess
came
up
in
a
different
posture.
it
wasn't
--
i
think
--
it
was
an
attempt
to
sue
the
authority,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
don't
think
that
they
are
at
all
comparable.
this
is
a
case
of
does
the
--
does
the
authority
have
standing
or
--
to
bring
the
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
why
not?
i
mean,
if
it's
totally
a
creature
of
states
--
that's
all
it's
--
there's
no
other
shareholders,
nobody
in
the
picture,
just
--
they
are
all
states
that
create
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
create
it,
though.
they
--
the
states
create
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
can
--
how
could
they
not
be,
mr.
dellinger?
there's
only
one
complaint,
and
that
complaint
is
on
behalf
of
all
the
plaintiffs,
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there's
no
discrete
claim
made
by
the
commission
as
distinguished
from
south
carolina.
