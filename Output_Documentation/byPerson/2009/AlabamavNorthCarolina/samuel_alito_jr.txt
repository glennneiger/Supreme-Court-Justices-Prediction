samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
your
position
--
what
do
you
say
that
the
states
contemplated
regarding
the
financing
of
these
--
of
these
projects?
that
the
state
that
was
unfortunate
enough
to
be
selected
as
the
second
state
would
have
to
pay
the
full
cost,
even
if
it
was
$200
million,
and
then
would
--
how
long
would
it
take
for
that
state
to
get
that
money
back?
would
it
have
to
wait
until,
you
know,
80,
100
years
later
to
get
the
benefit
of
some
other
state
having
to
finance
a
project?
