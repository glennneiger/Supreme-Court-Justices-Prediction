did
it
misspend
that
money?
are
you
saying
the
money
was
misspent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
claims
of
the
states
are
identical
to
the
claim
the
commission
is
asserting,
which
was
the
--
which
was
the
instance
in
the
arizona-california
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
the
obligation
of
the
commission
to
show
that
there
is
an
absolute
parallel
between
the
claims.
and
i
just
don't
see
where
i
can
infer
from
the
record
or
conclude
that
that
is
the
case.
and
if
--
and
if
that
is
not
so,
then
the
commission
is
not
like
the
indian
tribes
in
the
arizona
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
am
conscious
of
your
white
light,
but
it
does
seem
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
the
commission
is
--
is
asking
for
the
money
for
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
here
the
commission
is
seeking
sums
for
itself.
what
assurance
do
we
have
that
the
commission,
if
it
received
the
money,
would
give
it
back
to
the
states
exactly
in
the
ratio
the
states
demand
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
think
it's
their
obligation
to
show
the
complete
parallel
between
--
between
the
claims,
and
that
that
has
not
been
done.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
take
a
hypothetical
case
where
north
carolina
did
have
a
real
advantage
and
they
used
the
money
to
create
a
facility,
would
that
bear
on
the
unjust
enrichment
claim
or
even
the
sanctions
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
--
you
said
the
only
state
that
contributed
money
to
the
commission
was
north
carolina?
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
heard
that
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
--
suppose
we
think
that
the
same
state
--
or
the
same-claim
rule
applies,
and
that
if
the
commission
is
asserting
the
same
claim
as
the
state,
that
then
it
can
sue.
suppose
that's
the
rule.
are
these
the
same
claims?
