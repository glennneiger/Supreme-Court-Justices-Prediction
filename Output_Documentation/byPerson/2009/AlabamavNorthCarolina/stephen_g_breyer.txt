justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
how
do
you
--
what
is
--
is
that
absolutely
necessary?
any
party
state
may
withdraw
from
the
compact
by
enacting
a
law
repealing
the
compact.
that
sentence
seems
to
me
your
toughest
point
because
that's
what
they
did.
they
simply
withdrew.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
where
in
the
contract
is
it
something
that
says
--
i
mean,
maybe
that
was
foolish,
to
put
that
in
there,
but
they
did
put
it
in.
and
so
how
do
you
deal
with
that
sentence,
which
is
one
that
justice
scalia
brought
up
in
his--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well
--
all
right.
well,
go
ahead,
explain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
in
this
implicit
that
the
state
of
north
carolina,
prior
to
their
withdrawal,
while
they
are
still
acting,
will
appropriate
reasonable
amounts
of
money
for
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
appropriate
steps
include--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
they
--
does
this
--
if
we
have
a
lend-lease
agreement
entered
into
a
treaty
and
absolutely
ratified,
i
suppose
that
if
congress
decides
not
to
lend
and
won't
appropriate
the
money
to
do
it,
we
are
in
breach
of
the
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
assume
if
there
is
a
similar
agreement
here
and
north
carolina's
legislature
doesn't
appropriate
any
money
for
whatever
internal
reasons,
north
carolina
is
in
breach
of
the
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
understand
this
correctly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
when
a
legislature
does
not
appropriate
the
money
that
the
executive
of
a
state
has
committed
to
another
state,
that
state
is
in
breach,
irrespective
of
whose
fault
it
is
within
the
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
this
case
then
boils
down
to,
am
i
correct,
in
the
years
prior
to
their
withdrawal,
did
they
take
the
steps,
appropriate
steps,
that
this
contract
obliges
them
to
make?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
they
did
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
--
but
if
you
win
on
that
one,
you
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
state
of
the
finding
of
the
commission
in
respect
to
that
precise
point,
and
it's
called
--
what
is
it
called?
the
"impact
commission"?
do
we
have
the
same
thing
in
mind,
the
commission?
is
that
what
it's
called?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have
--
they
are
the
ones
who
are
the
judge,
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that's
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
findings
in
respect
to
that
specific
2-year
point
are
what,
and
where
are
they
in
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
--
to
go
back
to
the
word
"sanctions",
when
i
read
the
word
"sanctions"
in
the
law,
the
thing
that
comes
to
my
mind
first
and
foremost
is
the
money,
like
a
fine;
and
sort
of
second,
imprisonment.
but
paying
a
fine,
that
--
that
seems
to
me
the
most
primitive
and
basic
sanction
of
anything.
and
--
and
why
--
and
particularly,
if
you
say
the
fine
was
limited
to
giving
back
money
you
previously
took.
so,
why
wouldn't
you
read
this
clause
here
which
says
"including"
--
and
then
it
doesn't
mention
money,
but
it
includes
some
other
things,
and
you
say
well,
sure,
they
include
the
other
things
because
the
word
"sanction"
doesn't
automatically
call
to
mind
those
other
things,
but
it
does
automatically
call
to
mind
a
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
are
we
supposed
to
--
are
we
supposed
to
treat
compacts
among
states
as
if
we
are
dealing
with
those
who
want
to
impose
obligations
on
the
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here,
aren't
we
trying
to
say
what
obligations
did
the
states
themselves
want
to
impose
on
themselves?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
adds
--
it
adds-it
starts
"qualifications".
it
says
it's
the
judge
of
qualification
and
it's
the
judge
of
their
compliance
with
the
conditions
and
requirements
of
this
compact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"and
the
laws
of
the
states
relating
to
the
enactment
of
the
compact.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
see.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
i
was
thinking
of
this,
is:
what
we
have
are
a
group
of
states,
each
of
whom
feels
it's
necessary
to
build
a
cholera
plant.
and
they
know
that
the
cholera
plant
will
be
hated
by
everybody
in
their
state,
but
it's
necessary.
so
they
each
say:
we'll
undertake
it,
okay?
but
the
deal
is
you
do,
too.
now,
that's
their
basic
deal.
i
don't
know
that
they
ever
would
have
entered
into
this
as
part
of
the
basic
deal
that
state
a
depends
for
4
years
on
state
b
doing
it,
but
when
it's
state
a's
turn,
they
run
away.
well,
that's
the
deal.
they
can
run
away.
but
in
addition,
take
$80
million?
okay.
that's
where
we
are
back
with
the
chief's
question.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
an
appropriate
step
or
not
an
appropriate
step
to
keep
the
80
million
as
well
as
running
away.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
an
arbitrator
that
was
supposed
to
decide
whether
it
was
or
whether
it
wasn't,
and
they
said
it
was
an
appropriate
step.
they
foresaw
you
would
take
the
80
million,
never
give
it
back,
at
least.
but
the
commission
thinks
it
isn't.
and
the
arbitrator
paid
no
attention
whatsoever
to
the
commission.
and
what
the
commission
says
in
the
language
that
i
quoted
is
that
the
commission
is
the
judge
of
the
members'
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
this
contract.
so
when
i
read
that,
i
think:
surely,
he
should
have
paid
some
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
thought
that
what
was
keeping
the
80
million
was
not
an
appropriate
step.
now,
there
we
are.
that's
my
question.
and
the
only
answer
i've
heard
so
far
is,
if
i
read
the
rest
of
the
sentence,
it
talks
about
laws
of
states
relating
to
the
enactment
of
this
contract
--
compact.
and
i
don't
know
that
you
read
"enactment"
so
narrowly
to
refer
to
laws
that
talked
about
how
you
adopt
it.
there
might
be
a
whole
lot
of
laws.
i
guess
you
pay
attention
to
all
of
them.
so
i
don't
see
what
the
last
phrase
has
to
do
with
it.
but
anyway,
that's
my
basic
question
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
your
opinion,
the
commission
is
not
the
judge
of
anything
other
than
membership?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
therefore,
the
six
pages
or
so
of
this
compact
that
has
to
do
with
a
lot
of
detailed
issues
that
might
appear
before
the
commission
--
it
is
not
the
judge
of
whether
there
is
compliance
with
those
issues--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
this
concerns
only
membership?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
--
why
would
anyone
stay
in
the
contract?
i
take
it
that
your
point,
which
is
an
awfully
good
one,
is
that
this
compact
was
designed,
like
others,
to
solve
a
political
problem.
it's
necessary
for
the
country
to
store
low-level
radioactive
waste,
necessary
for
health
and
safety,
but
because
of
the
politics
and
people's
understanding,
incomplete,
no
one
wants
it,
and
so,
now,
the
states
have
formed
a
series
of
compacts.
and
we
are
told,
in
an
amicus
brief,
that,
if
this
compact
is
interpreted
to
allow
one
state
to
take
advantage
of
another
state's
having
done
so
for
years
and
then
run
away
and
keep
$80
million
to
boot,
it
will
be
impossible
for
many
other
states
to
resist
that
same
route.
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
compacts
through
the
united
states,
and
what
we
will
have
is
low-level
waste
without
storage.
that's
argument,
roughly,
that's
made
in
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
know
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
--
what
--
you
just
said
--
i
may
not
have
misunderstood,
but
i
thought
you
said,
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
that,
during
1997
and
'98,
when
he
said
why
didn't
you
take
appropriate
steps,
that
you
said
you
didn't
do
anything,
and
that
was
the
appropriate
step;
is
that
right?
if
you
--
if
you
said
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
i
heard
you
correctly.
all
right.
but
then
it
shows
in
the
--
in
the
special
master's
report
that,
during
that
time,
you
received
from
the
commission
funds
over
$7
million.
so
you
may
not
have
done
anything,
but
you
did
take
$7
million
at
that
time
from
other
people.
and
so
they
are
saying,
fine,
if
you
didn't
take
any
anything,
didn't
do
anything,
and
that
was
the
appropriate
step,
why
isn't
it
the
appropriate
step
now
to
give
us
the
7
million
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
--
well
--
in
other
words,
north
carolina's
money
in
'97
and
'98,
which
was
$4
million,
went
to
pay
for
current
expenditures
during
north
--
during
that
year,
'97/'98,
but
the
commission's
money,
which
amounted
to
$7
million
in
that
time,
was
not
spent
on
current
things?
it
was
rather
a
payment
for
things
done
in
the
past?
this
sounds
not
--
i'm
not
--
i
mean,
that's
possible,
but
i
just
don't
recall
anything
that
suggests
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
whole
formula--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
whole--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work?
i
mean,
how
does
it
work?
the
--
there's
a
--
there's
a
plant
in
south
carolina,
and
a
truck
comes
up
filled
with
radioactive
waste
out
of
georgia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
go
to
a
booth,
and
now
they
are
charged
something.
and
is
the
fee
and
special
surcharge,
which
this
refers
to,
the
total
charge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
total
charge.
and
what
does
that
amount
to,
primarily?
do
we
have
any
idea
on
a
typical--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no
--
well,
i
don't
know
how
they
did
it.
but,
anyway,
there's
a
charge.
say
it's
$1,000,
or
maybe
it's
$10,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
the
truck
company
has
to
pay
$10,000
to
the
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
are
saying
here
that
that
$10,000
represents--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
financial
commitment
of
all
party
states
to
the
commission.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
money
might
--
seems
to
come
from
a
private
company.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
comes
from
a
private
company.
it
goes
to
the
--
it
goes
to
the
commission
--
it
goes
to
south
carolina--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
they
give
it
to
the
commission.
