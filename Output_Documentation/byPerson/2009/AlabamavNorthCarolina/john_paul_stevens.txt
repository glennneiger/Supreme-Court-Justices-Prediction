paul
stevens
but,
mr.
phillips,
i
really
don't
quite
understand
a
part
of
your
argument.
i'm
not
sure
what
happened
to
the
$80
million,
and
i
guess
you
aren't,
either.
and
if
in
fact
--
and
maybe
it
was
--
they
had
in
good
faith
used
that
money
to
try
and
complete
the
facility
and
then
decided
it's
just
not
worth
it,
would
you
still
be
entitled
to
get
the
80
million
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
basic
question
about
the
eleventh
amendment
argument?
you
--
you
framed
it
entirely
in
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
is
there
not
also
a
common
law
immunity
that
the
states
can
plead
against
non-sovereigns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
money
that's
--
but
the
money
that
is
talked
about
in
that
section,
as
i
read
it,
that's
money
that
would
be
generated
after
the
facility
was
completed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
the
money
generated
by
the
south
carolina
facility
was
the
money
of
the
compact
members?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
the
money
that
was
given
to
north
carolina?
