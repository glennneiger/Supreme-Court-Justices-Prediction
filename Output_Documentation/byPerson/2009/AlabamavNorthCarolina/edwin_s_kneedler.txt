mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
has
participated
in
this
case
both,
at
the
court's
invitation,
at
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
stage
and
then
before
the
special
master,
primarily
on
the
issues
that
were
addressed
in
the
special
master's
preliminary
report,
which
go
to
questions
of
the
assertion
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
original
actions
as
well
as
the
structure
of
the
compact
and
the
compact's
power
to
assess
monetary
sanctions
itself.
today
we
make
two
principal
arguments:
one,
that
the
court
should
deny
north
carolina's
motion
to
dismiss
the
commission
as
a
party,
rejecting
at
this
time
or
for
the
time
being
the
assertion
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity;
and
second,
that
the
court
should
deny
the
claim
that
the
commission
has
the
power
itself
to
impose
monetary
sanctions
under
article
7(f).
that's
not
to
say
that
the
states
party
may
not
seek
monetary
relief,
appropriate
monetary
relief,
themselves
in
an
original
action
in
this
court.
it's
only
to
say
that
the
compact
commission
is
not
a
forum
established
by
the
compact
itself,
which
is
not
only
a
compact
between
the
states,
but
an
act
of
congress,
to
do
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
--
i,
think,
as
mr.
phillips
suggested,
this
court's
decision
in
--
in
the
united
states
v.
georgia
establishes
the
court
is
not
required
to,
and
in
some
circumstances
it
--
it
may
be
possible
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
--
on
the
merits
because
the
plaintiff
states
in
this
case
i
think
undoubtedly
have
a
cause--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
plaintiff
states
undoubtedly
have
a
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
the
compact.
they
are
parties
to
the
compact,
and
as
parties
to
the
compact,
they
can
bring
an
action
whether
or
not
the
commission
is
properly
before
--
before
the
court.
and
the
question
of
whether
the
--
north
carolina
violated
the
compact
therefore
can
be
adjudicated
solely
on
the
basis
of
--
of
the
plaintiff
states'
claim,
without
having
to
reach
the
question
of
--
of
whether
the
commission
could
properly
be
made
a
party.
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
the
special
master
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
compact,
then
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
could
be
--
could
also
bring
that
claim
and
what
--
what
remedy
there
might
be
for
that,
either
to
the
states
or
to
the
commission,
would
never
have
to
be-to
be
reached.
so
there
is,
i
think,
some
efficiency
with
--
with
respect
to
that.
but
on
the
eleventh
amendment
question--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
is
--
this
is
a
novel
question
as
--
as
far
as
i
--
as
far
as
i
am
aware.
and
--
and
that
may
be
one
reason
why
the
court
would
prefer
not
to
specifically
address
the
question.
but
i
--
but
i
do
think
on
the
--
on
the
basic
principles
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
that
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
v.
california,
at
least
at
this
stage
of
the
case,
is
dispositive.
because
there
the
court
concluded
that
the
states
--
because
the
united
states
had
intervened,
they
had
no
assertion
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
dispute.
as
the
court
put
it,
the
tribes
are
not
bringing
any
new
claims
or
issues
before
the
court,
and
therefore
the
judicial
power
of
this
court
would
not
be
enlarged
and
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
would
not
be
compromised
by
the
indian
tribes'
participation
in
the
case.
we
think
that's
an
important
principle,
at
least
with
respect
to
indian
tribes,
who
this
court
recognized
in
arizona--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
--
i
don't
think
the
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
two
things
about
that.
in
maryland
v.
louisiana,
which
was
a
suit
brought
by
a
number
of
states
to
challenge
a
--
a
louisiana
tax
on
commerce
clause
grounds,
that
case
went
forward
on
the
suit
of
the
--
of
those
states,
but
the
natural
gas
companies
who
paid
the
tax
were
permitted
to
intervene,
and
the
court
did
that,
notwithstanding
the
eleventh
amendment.
surely,
the
claim
of
the
states
parens
patriae
was
not
identical
to
the
claims
of
the
individual
natural
gas
companies
to
get
a
refund
on
their
own
behalf,
but
the
court
nonetheless
allowed
them
to
intervene,
and
the
court's
judgment
in
this
case
awarded
--
required
the
state
of
louisiana
to
make
refunds
to
--
to
all
taxpayers.
so
i
--
i
don't
think
--
especially
in
an
original
action
where
the
state
has
a
certain
parens
patriae
responsibility,
i
don't
think
that
the
claims
have
to
be
identical
in
the
precise
way
that
they
were
in
--
in
arizona
v.
california.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
although
i
--
i
think-i
think
--
i
don't
know
whether
this
falls
within
the
precise
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
compact
commission
is
regarded
as
a
citizen
of
another
state,
which
i
think
it
would
not
be.
but,
yes,
it
would
be
the
--
the
principle
recognized
in
alden.
but
i
--
the
principles
that
i
am
describing
here
i
think
would
apply
equally
to
that
immunity,
as
they
would
to
the
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
--
there
are
several
points
that
i
think
are
important
to
bear
in
mind
with
this.
i
think
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
monetary
liability
on
the
part
of
a
state
is
distinct
from
prospective
relief,
and
i
think
the
court
should
not
lightly
assume
that
states
have
agreed
to
have
a
nonjudicial
forum,
like
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and
as
we
point
out
in
pages
26
and
27
of
our
--
of
our
brief,
there
were
three
--
it's
actually
four
compacts
that
were
adopted
or
approved
in
the
very
same
act
of
congress
which
specifically
provide
for
monetary
sanctions
--
or
monetary
--
monetary
remedies,
which
shows
that
the
compacting
parties
knew
how
to
do
it
when
they
wanted
to.
but
beyond
that,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
overall
structure
of
article
7,
where
the
sanctions
power
appears.
first
of
all,
article
7(f),
which
is
on
page
19a
of
the
blue
brief,
refers
to
any
party
state
which
fails
to
comply,
et
cetera,
"may
be
subject
to
sanctions,
including
suspension
of
rights
under
the
compact
and
revocation.
"
those
are
all
forward-looking
sanctions.
but
--
but
i
think
what
really
reinforces
that
is
if
you
look
at
the
title
of
article
7,
which
is
on
page
17a,
it
says
--
it
deals
with
eligible
parties,
withdrawal,
revocation,
entry
into
force,
and
termination.
article
7
is
all
about
membership
in
the
--
in
the
commission.
the
commission's
powers,
by
contrast,
are
set
out
in
article
4
of
the
--
of
the
compact.
there
are
enumerated
powers
there
and,
for
example,
article
4(e)(11),
on
page
11a
--
the
only
enumerated
power
with
respect
to
sanctions
there,
at
the
bottom
of
11a,
is
to
revoke
the
membership
of
a
party
state
in
accordance
with
article
7(f).
one
would
think,
if
there
--
if
there
was
an
extraordinary
power
to
grant
monetary
sanctions,
that
it
would
have
appeared
in
the
enumerated
powers,
and
in
fact,
in
the
one
compact
adopted
at
the
same
time
that
provides
for
imposition
of
fines,
it
actually
appears
in
the
enumerated
powers
portion
of
the
relevant
compact,
not
in
the
membership.
and,
justice
breyer,
you
asked
about
section
--
article
7(c),
with
respect
to
the
power
of
the
commission
to
be
the
judge
of
--
of
certain
matters.
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
what
that's
driving
at
is
the
commission
being
the
judge
of
the
qualifications
of
the
--
of
the
states
and
the
members
of
the
commission
appointed
by
the
states
to
participate.
it's
like
the
power
of
any
legislative
body,
the
power
of
congress
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
someone
who's
about
--
who
has
been
voted
in,
should
that
person
be
seated.
i
think
article
7(c)
is
directed
at
that,
not
at
some
power
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
if
you
continue
--
"and
the
laws"--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
but
--
but
--
the
--
the
laws
of
the
parties
--
if
i
may
finish?
"the
laws
of
the
parties
state.
"
the
final
phrase
relating
to
the
enactment
of
the
compact,
i
think
would
modify
the
qualifications
--
compliance
with
the
conditions
and
requirements
of
the
compact
with
respect
to
membership.
again,
i
think
that
comes
from
the
first
part
of
article
7(c),
but
i
think
it's
--
it's
the
overall
thrust
of
article
7
that
it
deals
with
membership.
