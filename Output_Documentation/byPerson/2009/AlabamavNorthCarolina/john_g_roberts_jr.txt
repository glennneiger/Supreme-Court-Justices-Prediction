chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
132
on
our
original
docket,
alabama
v.
north
carolina.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
your
position
be
the
--
be
the
same
if
it
were
$20
million?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
whatever
the
commission
contributed?
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
enough
to
trigger
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
north
carolina
to
move
forward.
i
assume
there
is
some
level
where
you
would
say,
you
know,
they
took
their
chances,
and
it
didn't
work
out
--
as
opposed
to
they
obviously
committed
in
light
of
the
money
they
accepted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
there's
a
breach.
i
would
say
that
if
you
gave
them
$1
million,
you
should
not
view
that
as:
well,
we've
supported
your
efforts;
you
are
committed
to
do
this,
no
matter
how
much
it
costs,
because
we
have
given
you
$1
million.
it
seems
to
me
at
some
point
the
amount
becomes
pertinent
in
assessing
whether
you
have
a
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
dellinger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
took
--
you
took
$80
million,
and
they
got
nothing
for
it.
that
would
be
a
question
your
grandson
might
ask.
[laughter]
what
did
you
do
with
the
$80
million?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
mr.
phillips,
have
you
10
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then
--
but
those
states
couldn't
take
the
money.
they
couldn't
say,
i
want
my
share?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
saying
it
was
their
money,
but
they
had
no
access
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
original
action
132,
alabama
against
north
carolina.
