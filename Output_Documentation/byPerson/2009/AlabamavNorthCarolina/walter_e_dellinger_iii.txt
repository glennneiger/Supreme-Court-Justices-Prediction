mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
should
begin
with
a
simple
question
that
my
grandson
asked
me,
which
is
why
did
north
carolina
quit?
which
i
think
sheds
light
on
what
its
obligations
were
and
what
the
understanding
was.
this
is
a
compact.
it
is
not
based
upon
a
coercive
model.
you
could
have
one,
where
states
--
all
the
states
are
required
to
remain
in
the
compact,
withdrawal
is
a
nullity,
the
commission
can
enforce
financial
sanctions,
and
the
compact
members
waive
sovereign
immunity
and
can
be
sued
in
federal
court.
this
compact
is
based
on
a
consensual
model,
where
it
--
each
--
each
state
can
withdraw,
and
therefore
the
compact
has
to
be
in
the
rough
financial
interest
of
each
of
the
states
at
any
point
in
time,
which
is
what--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
$80
million
came
from-not
the
state
--
the
statement
that
the
states
gave
north
carolina
$80
million
and
north
carolina
has
kept
it
and
didn't
give
it
back
is
a
shorthand
that
is
misleading
in
every
single
respect.
the
funds,
of
course,
didn't
come
from
the
states.
they
contributed
$25,000
apiece.
it
came
from
charges
on
generators
from
all
over
the
country.
the
funds
went
to
the
authority
established
under
north
carolina
law
and
could
only
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
the
low-level
waste
authority,
and
indeed
they
all
were
used
for
the
purposes
of
the
low-level
waste
authority.
the
master
assumes
that
--
that
all--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
no
one
was
helped
by
this
process
or
the
process
of
the
other
compacts,
none
of
which
resulted
in
a
--
in
a
facility.
but
what
north
carolina
did
was
to
carry
out
its
responsibilities
to
take
appropriate
steps
and,
as
i
will
show
in
a
moment,
fully
in
accord
with
the
understanding
of
the
commission
and
north
carolina,
that
they
would
be
--
it
would
be
jointly
financed,
even
though
the
commission
had
no
legal
obligation.
but
the
key
reason--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
and
it
says
that
the
commission
does
not
have
any
legal
obligation--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--under
the
compact
to
fund
it,
either.
but
it
was
because
this
is
a
consensual
compact
and
because
of
the
right
to
withdrawal,
as
the
master
noted,
it
would
have
been
surprising
if
a
facility
were
constructed
without
significant
assistance
from
the
states
that
were
not
the
host
state
because
of
the
right
to
withdraw,
and
that
indeed
was
recognized
from
the
very
beginning.
for
example,
in
1996,
when
the
--
the
chairman
of
the
commission
was
hoping
to
speed
up
the
completion,
the
chairman
noted
that
the
opening
of
a
new
regional
facility
in
north
carolina
would
ensure
a
source
of
revenues
for
site
development
in
the
third
host
state.
indeed,
it's
not
surprising
that,
from
the
beginning
of
the
compact,
the
commission
provided
a
substantial
amount
of
the
funding
because
north
carolina
could
have
withdrawn
at
any
point.
and
the
commission
repeatedly
recognized
that
it
was,
quote,
"necessary
and
appropriate
and
reasonable
and
equitable.
"
for
the
commission
to
contribute
to
this.
mr.
phillips
cites
the
north
carolina
legislation
--
the
north
carolina
legislation,
which
notes
that,
among
the
commission's
--
the
authority's
corporate
powers,
when
it
sets
up
the
authority
or
the
financing
--
but
the
north
carolina
legislation,
as
the
commission
expressly
recognized
and
cited
in
providing
the
money,
provides
that
north
carolina
may
accept
funds
from
its
general
assembly.
the
north
carolina
authority
may
accept
funds
from
the
north
carolina
general
assembly,
from
the
commission
compact,
from
other
states,
from
the
federal
government,
or
from
generators.
and
they
begin
to
say
it's
necessary
and
appropriate.
at
every
step,
they
--
the
commission
says
that
in
--
in
february
of
'88,
october
of
'89,
september
of
'92,
november
of
'92,
"reasonable
and
equitable
to
provide
this
funding.
"
and
of
course
it
makes
sense,
given
the
consensual
nature
of
the
compact.
so,
what
happened?
why
did
north
carolina
quit?
what
happened
was,
because
of
the
right
to
withdraw,
south
carolina
withdrew
in
1995.
when
south
carolina
withdrew,
this
of
course
deprived
the
commission
of
a
ready
source
of
funding
from
the
fees
that
were
being
paid
to
the
facility
in
barnwell,
south
carolina.
but
much
--
or
of
equal
significance
is
the
fact
that
south
carolina,
having
withdrawn,
no
longer
had
to
comply
with
the
compact
requirement,
that
south
carolina
ceased
operating
a
facility
on
december
31,
1992.
why
was
that
important?
because
the
compact
creates,
as
mr.
phillips
noted,
something
like
a
monopoly
within
the
region,
and
when
you
are
financing
the
facility
you
know,
if
you
are
the
financing
authority,
that
you
will
have
a
captive
market--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--unless
--
unless
states
can
withdraw.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
all
right.
i'll
--
i'll
answer
them
in
reverse
order:
the
keeping
the
80
million
and
the
commission's
judgment
about
that.
their
argument
is
either
that,
you
know,
the
commission
is
somehow
the
sole
judge
of
these
issues
or
that
there's
some
--
that
you
should
treat
a
state
as
something
like
a
regulated
industry
under
an
agency
model.
and
they
--
and
they
point
to
7(c),
or
at
least
the
part
of
7(c)
that
they
leave
in
their
quote,
as
establishing
that.
and
what
i
think
mr.
kneedler
was
attempting
to
say
when
his
time
ran
out
is
that,
if
you
just
read
7(c),
it's
about
membership.
7(c)
is
in
a
five-provision
sequence:
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
and
(e).
(a)
lists
the
initial
state
members;
(b)
says
how
other
states
can
become
members;
(d)
provides
that
the
first
three
states
which
enact
and
pay
their
fees
will
bring
the
compact
into
existence.
and
(e)
states
that
members
of
other
compacts
are
not
eligible
for
membership.
then
(c),
in
the
middle,
says
that
each
state
shall
be
declared
a
party
state
upon
payment
of
the
fees
and
enactment,
and
the
commission
is
the
judge
of
the
qualifications
of
the
party
states
and
of
its
members
and
their
compliance
with
the
conditions
and
requirements
of
the
compact
--
and
if
i
may
go
"dot,
dot,
dot"
--
relating
to
the
enactment
of
this
compact.
now,
that
phrase
"relating
to
the
enactment"
might
refer
just
to
the
preceding
phrase
about
laws
of
the
party
states.
but
mr.
kneedler
and
i
both
read
it
more
naturally
in
the
context
of
the
commission
as
judge,
that
this
is
about
how
you
judge
who's
a
member.
it
is,
in
that
sense,
like
the
house
of
representatives
provision
they
quote,
except
it
doesn't
say
"sole
judge".
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
not
with--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--with
respect
to
parties
to
the
compact,
the
commission,
of
course,
has
to
interpret
the
compact
when
it
engages
in
its
sanction
authority.
if
it's
going
to
sanction
a
state
that
is
blocking
the
transmit
of
other
states,
it
has
to
interpret
what
it
is
applying.
i
think
what
the
--
counsel
is
arguing
that
it
was
entitled
to
some
special
deference,
and
what
the
master
is
saying
is:
given
the
right
to
withdraw,
why
should
north
carolina
--
why
should
it
be
allowed
any
deference
over
a
determination
by
the
state
that's
not
a
party
to
the
compact?
it
was
not
required
to
--
not
a
party
to
--
at
that
point,
to
the
compact.
now,
i
do
want
to
answer
your
question
about
north
carolina
keeping
the
money,
because
this
is
important.
where--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
i
am.
and
that's
not
grammatically
compelled;
it
is
permitted.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
it
does.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
this
is
about
--
it's
not
very
beautifully
done,
but
it's
about
the
commission
judging
who
becomes
a
member.
in
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
and
(e),
and
as
mr.
kneedler
noted,
in
the
other
compacts
that
were
based
on
a
model,
this-the
seventh
article
is
all
about
eligibility
for
membership.
the
powers
and
sanctions
and
parts
are
elsewhere
in
the
compact.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
and
it's
--
it's
also
captions
about
that
subject.
but
if
i
may
return
to
the
question
of
who's
got
the
money:
the
$80
million
coming
from
fees
generated
by
users
around
the
country
went
through
the
commission
to
the
authority.
it
was
set
up
in
a
special
separate
account
just
for
the
purposes
of
the
authority.
all
of
the
funds
were
expended
over
this
process
of
a
massive
amount
of
studies
that
were
done.
not
a
penny
of
it
could
ever
be
spent
by
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
for
any
purposes
whatsoever.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
it
has
been
10
or
12
years
since
this
occurred,
justice
ginsburg,
and
there
has
been
no
effort
and
no
plan
in
north
carolina
to
build
a
facility,
and
to
begin
the
licensing
process
anew.
some
of
the
information
they
--
the
authority
retained,
which
would
be
of
use
to
the
commission
anywhere,
whether
there
is
any
sitespecific
information
that
would
still
be
good
15
or
20
years
out,
i
think
is
just
pure
speculation.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
it
might
well
bear
on
the
unjust
enrichment,
if
there
was,
you
know,
an
enrichment.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
appropriated
money
that
went
to
the
authority.
properly
considered,
north
carolina
--
the
commission
provided
money
to
the
authority.
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
provided
money
for
the
authority.
all
the
funds
were
spent.
the
only
state
that
contributed
money
to
this
process
was
north
carolina,
and
north
carolina
contributed
$34
million.
now,
why
did
they
--
i
think
one
of
the
most
useful
documents
we
have
is
in
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--every
state
contributed
$25,000--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--to
sign
up.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
but
aside
from
that,
north
carolina
general
assembly
appropriated
$34
million
to
the
north
carolina
authority,
the
--
the
waste
disposal
authority.
they
were
the
only
state
to
do
so.
so
80
million
had
come
from
the
fees
generated
at
barnwell,
34
million
from
north
carolina,
and
the
--
what
happened
was
--
once
south
carolina
withdrew
from
the
compact,
was
liberated
from
this
obligation
to
close,
was
announcing
that
it
was
now
going
to
continue
and
is
open
to
the
world,
they
had
a
cost
advantage
and
a
location
advantage
over
north
carolina.
so
in
--
in
1996,
the
joint
supplemental
fact
brief
at
--
appendix
at
page
143,
is
where
the
head
of
the
north
carolina
authority
writes
to
the
head
of
the
commission
and
notes
that,
with
the
withdrawal
of
south
carolina
and
their
decision
to
continue
the
operation
at
barnwell,
the
financing
options
have
been
substantially
changed.
under
the
current
compact,
any
state
can
withdraw
up
until
the
north
carolina
facility
becomes
operational.
with
an
available
alternative
disposal
facility
now
in
south
carolina,
there
is
no
assurance
to
potential
bondholders
or
financiers
that
there
will
be
a
revenue
stream
from
which
to
repay
any
indebtedness.
therefore,
the
authority
is
in
a
position
where
the
intended
vehicles
for
financing
are
no
longer
possible.
one
possibility
is
to
modify
the
compact
to
preclude
withdrawal
from
the
compact,
once
the
license
is
issued
for
the
north
carolina
facility,
and
that
would
--
such
an
amendment
would
allow
--
future
use
of
the
facility
would
be
assured,
and
revenue
financing
could
be
considered.
it
was
not
practical
to
submit
that
to
all
seven
of
the
other
--
all
seven
legislatures
and
to
congress,
but
the
other
problem
is
it
would
not
have
--
its
--
its
passage
would,
by
no
means,
have
been
assured.
the
states,
at
that
moment,
could
either
stay
in
or
go.
so
north
carolina
is
faced,
after
south
carolina's
withdrawal,
with
the
prospect
of
advancing
--
trying
to
advance
bonds
for
another,
at
minimum,
$75
million
for
construction
costs,
which
would
bring
the
whole
project
up
to
223
million,
close
to
a
quarter
of
a
billion
dollars,
and
with
now
a
south
carolina
facility
that
is
closer
to
every
state
in
the
compact,
except
virginia,
and
where,
because
it
was
built
in
1981,
it
has
a
competitive
cost
advantage.
so
why
is
georgia
going
to
stay
in
the
compact,
when
it
has
what
may
be
a
--
a
less
costly
and
less
distant
alternative
in
going
to
barnwell,
south
carolina?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
my
response
to
that
is
that
the
amicus'
suggestion
that
a
decision
for
north
carolina
would
impair
the
very
useful
mechanism
of
interstate
compacts
has
it
exactly
backwards.
states
establishing
compacts
remain
entirely
free
to
include
or
add
provisions
limiting
the
right
to
withdraw;
permitting
the
imposition
of
sanctions,
including
financial
sanctions;
imposing
those
on
states
that
are
no
longer
members;
defining
whether
the
limits
will
be
a
million
dollars
or
a
hundred
million
for
what
they
will
impose
--
or
no
limits
at
all;
and,
as
the
central
compact
did,
requiring
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
so
that
these
judgments
can
be
enforced
in
federal
court.
all
that's
possible.
but
a
decision
in
--
whether
or
not
you
decide
for
north
carolina,
if
that's
what
you
want
in
a
compact,
you
can
have
that
compact,
and
nothing
in
a
decision
for
north
carolina
would
change
that.
a
decision
in
favor
of
north
carolina
would,
in
fact,
benefit
the
compacting
process
because
it
would
provide
assurances
to
state
legislators
that
you
can
pick
up
a
copy
of
the
proposed
compact
and
read
it
and
know
that
that
is
the
extent
of
the
liabilities
to
which
you
are
imposing
your
--
exposing
your
state,
and
that
is
the
limit
of
the
obligations
you
are
taking
on
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
the
original
compact
had
no
limits
whatsoever
on
withdrawal,
and
when
north
carolina
was
chosen
as
the
site,
it
proposed,
as
a
necessary
condition
to
its
not
--
not
withdrawing,
that
the
compact
be
admitted
to
add
a
provision,
7(h),
which
would
say
that
after
--
30
days
after
the
second
facility
becomes
operational,
no
state
may
withdraw
without
the
consent
of
all
the
other
states.
so
north
--
north
carolina
added
a
limitation
on
the
--
at
their
behest,
a
limitation
on
the
right
to
withdraw.
when
south
carolina
pulled
out,
it
was
clear
that
that
limitation
on
the
right
to
withdrawal
wasn't
good
enough
because
it
meant
that
states
could
withdraw
at
any
time
up
until
the
new
facility
became
operational,
in
which
case
it
was
going
to
be
too
late.
if
they
pulled
out
then
and
went
to
--
to
barnwell,
that
made
it
unbondable
because
there's
no
guarantee
--
what
made
it
possible
to
contemplate
financing
this
by
bonds
and
by
other
financing
mechanisms
was
the
insurance
of
a
market
and
the
right
to
withdraw--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
appropriate
steps--
mr.
walter

ensure
that
a
license
is

and
obtained.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
north--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because
north
carolina
hoped
that
--
and
no
longer
spending
2
million
a
year,
it
spent
half
a
million
to
get
--
to
keep
the
authority
going,
north
carolina
kept
open
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
some
possible
financing
that
might
allow
this
project
to
be
completed.
they
did
not,
as
mr.
phillips
suggested,
i
think
in
error
--
they
did
not
have
access
by
staying
in
the
compact
to
the
facility
at
barnwell,
south
carolina.
south
carolina
was
--
would
close
that
to
north
carolina,
so
--
so--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--but
the
steps
north
carolina
took
for
those
last
19
months
were
exactly
the
steps
that
were
appropriate.
because
they
did
not
have
an
obligation
to
fund
this
at
whatever
cost
and
because
they
were
willing
--
north
carolina's
willingness
to
continue
the
same
ratio
of
funding
that
had
been
a
part
of
the
process
for
the
preceding
8
years
was
not
going
to
provide
the
sums
necessary
to
complete
it,
it
would
have
been
a
waste
and
a
squandering
of
the
money
of
north
carolina's
taxpayers
and
the
commission
to
take
any
steps
that
required
the
expenditure--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
justice
scalia.
i'm
not
arguing
that
it's
impossible.
what
--
what
i'm
arguing
is
that,
if
north
carolina
had
continued
the
level
of
funding,
about
$3
million
a
year,
on
--
on
average,
north
carolina
had
been
contributing;
the
commission,
an
average
of
$7
million
had
been
--
if
north
carolina
had
contributed
that
and
some
--
it
would
not
have
come
close
--
after
the
withdrawal
of
south
carolina,
it
would
not
have
come
close
to
providing
the
funds
needed
to
complete
the
facility.
therefore,
any
funds
expended
would
have
been
wasteful
and
inappropriate.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
the
document
i
cited,
december
13,
'96,
begins
to
set
out
some
of
the
proposals.
one
proposal,
for
example,
was
to
ask
generators
--
major
generators
to
take
an
equity
position
in
the
authority,
that
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
would
continue
its
funding
at
the
same
rate
it
had.
till
the
last
day,
north
carolina
was
willing
to
spend
at
that
rate.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
breyer,
there
is
a
--
i
--
there
is
a
disconnect
between
when
funds
are
expended
and
when
they
are
paid
into.
there
is
some
deficit
financing,
so
that
the
commission's
payment
in
1998
would
have
been
to
provide
for
expenditures
that
occurred
earlier.
so
there
was
no
--
there
was
--
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
there
is
any
money
left
over.
and
--
and,
how
can
i
put
it?
north
carolina
doesn't
--
never
had
that
money.
it
went
to
the
authority
in
a
separate
and
dedicated
fund
that
could
only
be
used
for
the
authority's
purposes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
north
carolina
spent
half
a
million
dollars
a
year
to
fund
the
authority
for
the
remaining
19
months.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that's
correct.
and
let
me
read
you--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--north
carolina's
2
million
also
would
have
been
paid
for
past
--
there
was
not
$2
million
spent
on
activities
in
1998.
that's
--
that's
the
payment
of
prior
bills.
there's
--
these--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--these
funds
are
coming
into
the
--
coming
into
the
authority.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
they
do.
that's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
admission
of
--
the
authority
with
funds
from
--
that
had
come
from
the
commission
and
from
the
north
carolina
general
assembly.
here's
the
actual--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
not
necessarily.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
to
say
--
there
was
not
$6
million
expended
during
that
period.
there's
not
an
exact
match-up
between
that
list
of
when
payments
were
made
and
when
expenditures
were
made.
but
the
record
showed
that
north
carolina
spent
about
--
i
believe
about
--
the
authority
spent
about
half
a
million
dollars
those
last
19
months.
now,
here's
the
--
here's
the
actual
admission
that
north
carolina,
quote,
"did
nothing".
paragraph
--
this
is
at
the
plaintiffs'
appendix
460.
the
admission
request
was:
admit
that
north
carolina
took
no
further
steps
after
december
19th
to
ensure
that
an
application
for
a
license
was
filed.
response:
it
is
admitted
that
the
authority
was
deprived
of
funding
upon
notification
from
the
commission
in
or
around
1997
that
the
commission
was
terminating
its
transmittal
to
the
authority
of
portions
of
funds
derived
from
fees
and
surcharges
imposed
on
generators.
it
is
further
admitted
that
the
authority
had
justifiably
relied
--
the
north
carolina
authority
--
on
the
continued
provision
of
these
funds
in
light
of
the
commission's
previous
words
and
actions.
for
this
reason,
the
authority
did
not
thereafter
take
--
thereafter
take
additional
steps
to
site--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
proposal,
first
of
all,
left
a
significant
shortfall,
as
the
master
found.
even
with
that
proposal,
which
north
carolina
thought
there
were
some
legal
problems
with
whether
it
would
be
--
that
loans
from
private
generators
would
allow
bonding
of
the
remaining
financing
--
the
master
says
it
was
still
a
substantial
gap
left,
even
if
north
carolina
continued
to
pay
the
same
amount
of
money.
so,
with
north
carolina
willing
to
continue
to
pay
at
the
same
rate
it
had
for
the
previous
8
years,
and
the
commission
unwilling
or
unable
to
do
so,
it
meant
that
that
level
of
expenditure
by
north
carolina
would
be
a
worthless
expenditure
of
its
taxpayers'
money
and
the
commission's
money.
the
commission's
position
seems
to
be
that
they
should
have
taken
steps
just
for
the
sake
of
taking
steps,
like
building
half
a
bridge
to
nowhere,
when
you
know
that
there's
no
financing
in
sight.
they
could
have
withdrawn
on
december
19th,
and
they
took
exactly
the
steps
that
were
appropriate,
which
is
not
to
spend
money
that
is
futile
and
wasteful.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
don't
know
that
there
is,
justice
sotomayor.
i
would
not
assume
there
is
any-any
value.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there's
no
--
as
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
value
to
north
carolina.
there's
no
--
in
that
sense.
the
--
of
the
quasi-contract
claims.
could
i
turn,
if
i
could,
to
the
participation
of
the
commission,
which
we
think
raises
a
--
a
substantial
constitutional
question?
this
is
actually,
and
should
be,
a
very
simple
question.
states,
either
at
common
law
or
constitutionally
--
for
these
purposes,
it
doesn't
matter
which
side
of
the
fence
you
are
on
in
alden.
states
have
a
right
not
to
be
subject
to
suit
by
parties
that
aren't
the
united
states
or
a
sister
state,
absent
a
valid
abrogation.
the
commission
is
neither.
it's
not
a
state,
and
that
should
be
pure
and
simply
the
answer
to
the
question.
the
issues
are
whether
somehow
there
should
be
an
exception
for
a
compact.
it
should
be
treated
like
a
state
and
allowed
to
sue;
or,
even
if
it's
treated
like
any
other
private
litigant,
there
is
some
kind
of
same-claims
exception
--
in
fact,
there
is
one
case,
arizona,
only,
which
really
addresses
this
point
--
there
should
be
a
same-claims
exception.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
whether
the
compact
ought
to
be
able
to
sue
as
if
it
were
a
state,
i
think
that's
resolved
--
and
this
court,
when
it
rejected
a
compact
suit
in
number
131
--
of-the
commission
suit,
might
have
thought
the
same
--
by
the
hess
case.
it
says
that
compacts
cannot
claim
sovereign
immunity.
if
they
don't
have
the
dignity
or
status
to
claim
sovereign
immunity,
they
surely
ought
not
be
able
to
affirmatively
pierce
the
sovereign
immunity
of
something
that
is
undoubtedly
a
state.
they
are
not--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
you
could
distinguish
them
--
but
--
distinguish
the
two
situations.
but
that
would
cut
in
favor
of
this
situation.
you
might
think
that
a
compact
has
the
right
to
sue
as
if
it
were
a
state,
another
state,
a
state,
and
still
think
that
--
you
might
think
it
had
sovereign
immunity,
but
not
that
it
could
bring
a
suit
against
a
state.
but
you
certainly
wouldn't
think
that
if
it's
not
even
entitled
to
invoke
sovereign
immunity
on
its
own
behalf,
that
it
ought
to
be
able
to
bring
it.
but
no
matter.
there's
no
good
argument.
with
or
without
hess,
there
is
no
good
argument
for
treating
a
compact
as
if
it
were
a
state.
that
is
a
slippery
road--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
states
do
not
control
this
private
--
this
separate
entity.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
states
created
it.
it
is
run
by
a
group
of
commissioners,
two
from
each
state,
who
vote
individually
and
are
not
bound.
for
example,
the
representatives
from
georgia
and
mississippi
on
the
commission
voted
to
bring
this
litigation
against
north
carolina.
the
states
of
georgia
and
mississippi
did
not
decide
to
join.
they
--
they
voted
differently
from
where
their
states
are.
and
--
and
one
of
the
things
about
the
--
the
commission
doesn't
have
the
same
constraints
that
a
state
has.
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
might
think
long
and
hard
before
submitting
an
onerous
document
discovery
request
on
a
sister
state
and
making
that
kind
of
scorched-earth
litigation
a
practice.
something
that's
not
a
state
doesn't
have
those
constraints.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
they
are
--
first
of
all,
they
are
not
the
same
claims.
the
states
who
gave
$25,000
are
trying
to
claim
that
the
commission
either
is
their
agent
or
that
they
can
bring
a
suit
that
restitution
ought
to
be
made
to
the
commission,
that
is
a
--
the
short
answer
is
those
are
different
routes.
they
are
not
the
same
claims,
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
but
you
would
have
the
same
last
line
of
a
complaint
if
1
million
people
joined
the
state
who
brought
an
antitrust
suit
against
another
state.
it
is
simply
that
--
award
the
plaintiffs
such
damages
as
this
court
deems
just
and
proper.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
the
commission
is
making
a
straight-up
restitution
claim,
which,
as
the
--
the
entity
that
provided
the
funds,
it
does
not.
but
let
me
say
why
i
think
the
separate
and
--
even
if
the
claims
were
identical,
we
don't
know,
at
this
point,
that
they
will
wind
up
being
identical,
and
states
shouldn't
have
to
litigate
until
we
find
out.
the
master
just
says
it's
not
necessarily
the
case
that
they
will
wind
up
being
identical.
mr.
phillips
says
--
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
said
they
would
not
concede
that
they
would
not,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
forgo
any
claim
on
behalf
of
the
--
of
the
states
that
the
commission
didn't
have.
but,
most
importantly,
there
is
alden.
alden
makes
this
a
civil
case
because
alden
says
that
private
suits
against
non-consenting
states
present
the
indignity
of
subjecting
a
state
to
the
coercive
processes
of
judicial
tribunals.
if
you
allow
another
party
in
that's
not
a
state,
you
are
subjecting
a
state
to
all
of
the
discovery,
all
of
the
different
theories,
all
of
the
depositions,
all
of
the
document
requests.
a
sister
state
may,
in
its
attorney
general's
office,
think
twice
about
doing
that.
a
private
litigant
will
not.
so
i
think
this
case
is
that
--
i
believe
if
you
didn't
want
to
overrule
arizona,
you
could
say
it's
a
case
where
the
united
states
brought
a
case
in
its
role
as
trustee
for
the
indian
tribes
and
the
tribes
themselves
were
allowed
to
intervene,
and
they
were,
therefore,
virtually
one
and
the
same
party.
and
you
wouldn't
need
to
overrule
it.
i
don't
think,
if
it
stands
for
any
broader
principle,
it
can
survive
alden
v.
maine.
now,
if
the
commission
is
out,
then
we
think
there
is
--
and
if
you
agree
that
there
was
no
breach
of
contract,
then
i
think
the
court
should
direct
the
dismissal
of
the
quasi-contract
claims
because
only
the
states
will
be
left
as
a
party.
and
those
claims
--
quasi-contract
claims
of
restitution,
it's
--
they
are
claims
that
are
governed
by
the
subject
matter
of
the
compact
between
the
states,
and
as
to
parties
to
the
compact,
there
can't
be
any
such
claims,
and
i
think
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
thank
you.
