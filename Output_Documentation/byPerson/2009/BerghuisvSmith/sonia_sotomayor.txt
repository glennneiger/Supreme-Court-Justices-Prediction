you
would
suggest
that
in
a
population
that
has
9
percent
of
any
group,
protected
group,
that
if
they
didn't
have
one
person
serve
on
a
jury
per
year
of
that
group,
that
that
would
not
--
under
an
absolute
disparity
test
using
the
10
percent
figure,
that
would
not
give
rise
to
any
kind
of
suspicion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
would
not
meet
the
duren's
second
prong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
make
any
sense
to
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
that
any
court
has
suggested
that
the
complete
absence
of
the
protected
group
in
that
kind
of
number
wouldn't
give
rise
to
a
fair
representation
claim.
that's
why
this
court,
the
michigan
court,
and
many
others
have
said
that
the
absolute
disparity
test
just
can't
be
used
in
every
circumstance.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't.
the
question
i
have
you
for
you
is
--
that's
what
you
have
been
advocating,
or
at
least
your
brief
suggested
we
should.
wouldn't
it
be
better
for
to
us
leave
this
in
the
hands
of
the
courts
to
sort
of
figure
out
what
test
is
better
under
what
circumstances
than
us
announce
a
flat
rule
that
would
lead
to
a
result
like
the
example
that
i
just
used?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
agree
that
if
a
protected
group
is
1
percent
of
the
population,
that
it's
not
likely
that
their
absence
is
going
to
give
rise
to
any
flags.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
i
don't
--
i
just
don't
know
statistically
where.
and
we
have
to
leave
this
in
the
judgment
of
the
lower
courts
as
to
where
between
1
and
9
or
1
and
10
a
difference
makes
sense.
and
that's
what
the
courts
are
saying,
is:
we
can't
use
one
test
to
determine
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so,
what
--
what
did
it
result
in?
it
resulted
over
a
6-month
period
and
a
difference
between
18
percent
underrepresentation
and
15
percent.
and
your
adversary
says
that's
not
statistically
meaningful
difference,
that
3
percent,
because
it
only
takes
a
difference
of
a
couple
of
people
to
change
it
from
18
to
15.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
--
what's
unreasonable
about
that
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
can't
--
you
are
comparing
apples
and
oranges,
because
your
pre-spike
was
over
a
year
and
your
post-spike
was
over
6
months.
we
don't
know
what
would
have
happened
--
or
didn't
have
statistics
of
a
year
or
longer.
