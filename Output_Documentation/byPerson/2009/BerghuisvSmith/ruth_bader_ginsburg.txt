justice
ruth
bader

i
think
your
point
was
that
duren
was
quite
different
in
the
numbers--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--starting
out
with
women
54
percent
of
the
population,
and
then
dwindled
to
14.5
percent
of
the
--
of
the
jurors,
available
jurors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
but
your
test
is
10
percent.
and
if
you
have
a
minority,
what
is
it
here?
7
point
--
whatever
it
is.
7--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
under
10
percent.
that
would
mean
that
a
district
is
free
to
just
disregard
all
the
people
who
are
under
10
percent
of
the
population.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
the
michigan
supreme
court
do
essentially
what
justice
alito
suggested,
that
they
said:
we'll
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,
go
on
to
the
third.
but
on
that
third,
it
seems
to
me
there's
nothing
that
shows
us
what
was
the
representation
in
the
district
before
they
made
the
change
vis-à-vis
the
circuit
courts,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
--
that's
in
the
--
in
the
circuit
court.
do
we
know
what
the
figures
were
just
for
the
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
they
would
not
have
--
have
gone
on
to
the
systemic
issue,
because
the
disparity
was
so
marked,
just
on
the
--
just
on
the
numbers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
point
of
information:
what
is
the
michigan
id?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
there
you
were
dealing
with
an
express
exemption.
there
was
an
exemption
for
a
woman,
and
also
in
the
record
was
that
the
jury
clerk
was
sending
out
notices
saying:
women,
if
you
do
not
wish
to
serve,
return
the
summons
to
the
judge
named
on
the
reverse
side
as
quickly
as
possible.
and
then,
further
--
systematic
--
if
the
card
was
not
returned,
if
a
card
sent
to
a
woman
was
not
returned,
it
was
automatically
assumed
that
she
did
not
wish
to
serve.
there
was
no
follow-up.
so
there
was
all
kinds
of
evidence
of
systematic
problems
in
duren
that
are
not
present
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
the
court
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
that
was
after
--
that
was
after
showing
the
systematic
factors.
it
was
the
plaintiff's
burden
--
or
the
defendant
in
the
case,
duren
--
burden
to
show
there
was
a
systematic
factor.
that
was
the
automatic
exception
for
a
woman
and
how
it
worked
in
practice.
after
all
of
that,
then
justice
white
tells
us,
the
state
could
still
come
back
and
say
yes,
that's
true,
but
there
were
other
reasons
why
women
didn't
show
up.
maybe
they
were
disproportionately
elderly,
or
maybe
they
were
involved
with
child
care.
that's
what
--
that's
what
duren
said,
that
the
--
showing
a
systematic
factor
was
the
plaintiff's
burden,
and
then
the
state
could
justify
why
the
numbers
came
out
that
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you
there
for
a
moment?
because
one
of
the
things
that
was
in
the
duren
opinion
was
that
a
child
care
excuse
would
be
okay.
i
think
justice
white
said
at
the
end,
now,
i'm
not
touching
the
typical
hardship
excuses,
and
one
of
them
was
child
care,
and
that
is
--
certainly,
in
the
early
'70s,
was
going
to
disproportionately
affect
women.
you
have
far
fewer
women
if
you
give
a
child
care
exemption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
--
he
wasn't
talking
about
individual
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
--
is
there
a
federal
district
that
corresponds
to
this
kent
county?
is
there
a
federal
district
court
that
would
be
calling
jurors
in
--
in
the
same
geographical
area?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
have
--
you
don't
have
comparable
--
comparable
records
for
what
was
going
on
in
the
--
in
the
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back
to
your
point
about
--
that
there
was
a
big
change
when
the
draw
came
from
the
circuit
first,
before
the
districts.
i
thought
it
was
agreed
that,
before,
there
was
an
18
percent,
on
average,
comparative
difference
and,
after,
15
percent.
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
big
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
question
of
what
was
permitted.
here
you're
trying
to
say
this
is
required.
the
school's
case
was,
these
are
measures
the
district
could
take
if
it
wanted
to.
but
you
are
saying
these
are
measures
the
district
must
take
because
the
constitution
requires
it.
they
are
quite
different
settings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
sixth
amendment
secures
to
persons
charged
with
crime,
the
right
to
be
tried
by
an
impartial
jury
drawn
from
sources
reflecting
a
fair
cross
section
on
the
community.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
was
that
right
accorded
to
responding
diapolis
smith,
an
african-american
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
by
an
all
white
jury
in
kent
county,
michigan
in
1993.
in
duren
v.
missouri
a
1979
decision,
this
court
described
three
showings
essential
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendments
fair
cross
section
requirement.
a
defendant
must
show
that
a
group
qualifying
as
‘distinctive’
is
not
fairly
represented
in
jury
pools
and
that
the
under-representation
is
due
to
systematic
exclusion
in
the
jury
selection
process.
the
defendant
in
duren
readily
met
all
three
measures.
he
complained
of
the
dearth
of
women
in
the
jackson
county
missouri
jury
pool.
women
54%
of
the
jury
eligible
population,
but
only
14.5%
of
those
in
the
pool
from
which
jurors
withdrawn.
identifying
the
systematic
cause
of
the
under-representation,
duren
pointed
to
missouri's
law
exempting
all
women
from
mandatory
jury
service
and
to
the
manner
in
which
jackson
county
administered
the
exemption.
we
have
reviewed
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
holding
that
smith
satisfied
the
criteria
established
by
duren
and
granting
him
habeas
corpus
relief.
the
disparity
in
smith’s
case
was
not
so
dramatic
as
in
duren.
at
the
time
of
smith’s
trial
african-americans
were
7.28%
of
the
county’s
jury
eligible
population
and
6%
of
the
pool
from
which
jurors
were
drawn.
warranting
heavyweight,
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
in
a
cogent
decision
had
held
that
smith’s
evidence
failed
to
prove
systematic
exclusion.
relevant
to
our
appraisal
in
1996
in
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
congress
placed
tight
constraints
on
federal
habeas
review
of
state
court
convictions.
nevertheless
the
sixth
circuit
found
the
matter
settled,
a
decision
contrary
to
its
own
that's
what
it
said
would
involve
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
we
reverse
the
sixth
circuit’s
judgment.
no
decision
of
this
court
clearly
establishes
smith’s
entitlement
to
federal
court
relief.
the
sixth
circuit
featured
kent
county’s
practice
of
assigning
prospective
jurors
first
to
local
district
boards.
only
after
local
needs
were
filled
did
a
county
assign
persons
remaining
on
the
master
list
to
the
countywide
circuit
court,
the
sole
court
competent
to
hear
felony
cases
like
smith’s.
the
michigan
supreme
court
however
had
rejected
smith’s
principle
plea
for
lack
of
proof
that
the
assignment
procedure
in
fact
posed
significant
under-representation.
as
that
determination
was
not
at
all
unreasonable
the
sixth
circuit
had
no
warrant
to
disturb
it.
smith
also
urged
that
a
host
of
factors
combined
to
reduce
systematically
the
number
of
african-americans
appearing
on
kent
county
jury
list,
for
example,
kent
county’s
practice
of
executing
people
without
adequate
proof
of
alleged
hardship
and
the
refusal
of
kent
county
police
to
enforce
court
orders
for
prospective
jurors
to
appear.
this
court
it
suffices
to
observe
has
never
held
or
even
hinted
that
a
bare
cross
section
claim
can
be
grounded
in
generally
applied
jury
selection
process
features
of
the
kind
smith
lists.
our
decision
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
unanimous.
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
