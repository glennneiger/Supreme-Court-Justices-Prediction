john
paul

may
i
interrupt
with
this
question
that
goes
both
to
what
justice
ginsburg
asked
and
the
other?
should
we
treat
all
areas
the
same,
depending
--
say
it's
--
the
disparity
between
a
jurisdiction
which
has
only
3
or
4
percent
of
a
minority
should
be
treated
similarly
to
a
jurisdiction
where
they
have
30
or
40
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
perfectly
obvious
that
you're
going
to
have
dramatic
differences
where
you
only
have
a
very
small
percentage,
as
in
--
in
grand
rapids,
for
example,
and
where
you
have
a
major
percentage
as
you
did
in
duren.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
possible
--
it's
awfully
hard
to
get
these
percentages
when
you
get
small
numbers,
as
you
do.
but
doesn't
it
seem
intuitively
obvious
that
if
you
give
the
district
courts
first
crack
of
--
of
the
size
of
the
pool
that
has
more
of
the
african-american
potential
jurors
in
it
than
the
other,
that
it's
--
it's
bound
to
have
an
impact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
there's
a
much
higher
percentage
of
african-americans
in
grand
rapids
than
there
is
in
the
county
as
a
whole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
the
jurors
that
served
on
the
district
court,
were
they
--
were
they
taken
from
the
entire
county,
too,
or
just
from
grand
rapids?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
district
court
jurors
could
--
could
include
as
many
jurors
who
are
not
from
grand
rapids
as
they
could
from
grand
rapids?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
--
apparently,
we
were
not
communicating
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
the
jurors
who
served
on
the
district
court
were
primarily
from
grand
rapids,
rather
than
kent
county
as
a
whole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
factual
question.
could
they
put
on
the
district
court
jurors
who
did
not
come
from
grand
rapids?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then,
inevitably,
if
you
give
the
district
court
jurors
first,
a
pool
of
african-american
jurors
are
going
to
be
larger
serving
in
the
district
court
than
in
the
--
in
the
felony
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
factual
question:
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
michigan
in
fact
has
changed
the
practice
with
regard
to
giving
priority
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
make
sure
i
understand
your
position.
assume
that
there
is
an
--
an
identifiable
disparity
of
2
percent
or
3
percent,
or
whatever
it
might
be
to
get
to
the
threshold
of
being
significant,
that's
entirely
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
members
of
the
minority
have
personal
excuses
that
justify
non-service.
what
do
you
do
with
that
case?
do
you
find
that
it
was
--
it's
unconstitutional,
or
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is.
it's
assuming--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
didn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
is
it
unconstitutional,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
society
benefits
because
--
if
you
make
them
serve;
the
society
benefits
if
you
grant
the
excuses,
too.
