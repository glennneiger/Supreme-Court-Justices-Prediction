mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
okay.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
annual
jury
call
of
minorities
at
the
courthouse
in
grand
rapids
is
down
by
7.28
percent
of
the
total
number
of
jurors
called,
that
means
if
it
happens
in
detroit,
that
means
almost
nothing,
but
if
it
happens
in
grand
rapids,
that's
every
minority.
the
petitioner's
goal
is
to
have
this
court
enshrine
into
law
a
rule
that
the
two
situations
are
exactly
the
same.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
i
think
that
certainly
if
you
adopt
the
petitioner's
test
for
60
percent
of
the
country,
duren
would
not
apply
regarding
african
--
americans;
90
percent
of
the
country,
wouldn't
apply
to
hispanics;
and
duren
protections
would
never
apply
to
native
americans
anywhere.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
i
would
make
this
observation:
that
in
duren
v.
missouri,
on
page
366,
the
court
stated,
"his
undisputed
demonstration
that
a
large
discrepancy
occurred,
not
just
occasionally,
but
in
every
weekly
venire
for
a
period
of
nearly
a
year,
manifestly
indicates
that
the
cause
of
the
representation
was
systematic
--
that
is,
inherent
in
the
particular
jury
selection
process
utilized.
"
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
first
of
all,
that's
completely
correct;
however,
the
rule
in
duren,
the
u.s.
supreme
court
stated
that
the
numbers
alone
prove
systematic.
then
the
court--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--on
page
366.
and
then
in
--
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
state
is
arguing
that
there's
various
neutral,
benign
reasons
for
the
underrepresentation--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--it
did.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
justice
scalia,
my
reading
of
duren
does
indeed
include
that
third
test,
but
the
problem
is,
is
that
duren
puts
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
test
on
the
state.
they
said
at
pages
368
to
369
that
the
state
is
claiming
there
were
all
sorts
of
neutral,
legitimate
reasons
for
the
underrepresentation--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
we
did
show
a
number
of
systematic
factors,
but
if
you
look
at
duren
itself,
on
page
366
it
says,
the
numbers
alone
proved
it.
on
--
further
on
366,
they
stated
that
duren--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
i
believe
that
we
met
the
three-prong
test,
but
i
feel
that
it
is
an
error
in
reading
duren
to
say
anything
other
than
that:
the
state
must
show
how
this
came
about,
not
the
defendant.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--did
show
it,
and--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--it
says
that
at
pages
368
to
369.
and
the--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
i
would
read
one
sentence
from
duren,
if
i
could:
"assuming,
arguendo,
that
the
exemptions
mentioned
by
the
court
below
would
justify
failure
to
achieve
a
fair
community
crosssection
on
jury
venires,
the
state
must
demonstrate
that
these
exemptions
caused
the
underrepresentation
complained
of.
"
and
i
think
that
all
of
the
courts,
all
along
the
way,
including
michigan's
supreme
court,
have
overlooked
that
important
principle.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
that
is--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--that's
right.
because
those
jurors
that
were
pulled
out
for
district
court,
many
of
them
did
not
serve
in
district
court.
the
majority
did
not,
but
they
were
still
removed
from--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--from
the
overall
pool.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
i
don't
believe
either
side
established
that.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
the
court
because
it
is
not
necessary,
in
our
view,
that
each
specific
item
that
led
to
underrepresentation
be,
itself,
something
that's
unconstitutional,
but
rather,
the
collective
nature
of
it,
that
15
out
of
17
months
persistently
and
repeatedly
came
up
with
substantial
underrepresentation.
you
are
talking
about
34.8
percent
here.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
i
feel
that--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--i
feel
that
there
are
a
number
of
factors.
i
suppose
that
we
could
do
it
on
the
basis
of
height
and
then
be
surprised
when
there's
fewer
women
on
the
jury.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
the
record
showed--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--that
the
people
who
were
actually
showing
up
for
the
jury
panels
at
circuit
court
were
very
heavily
overrepresented
in
the
rural
areas
of
kent
county
and
heavily
underrepresented--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--right.
well,
i
guess--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--yes.
well,
first
of
all,
grand
rapids
has
several
district
courts,
and
the
largest
one
is
the
district
court
for
the
city
of
grand
rapids.
and
as
one
would
predict,
the
judicial
business
of
a
large
city
is
certainly
going
to
be
more
extensive
than
the
judicial
business
in
rural
areas.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
i
guess
i
would
simply
say
that
the
court
administrator
testified
and
the
district
judge
found
that
they
had
substantial
underrepresentation
that
was
very
noticeable,
very
visible,
a
severe
problem,
and
after
my
client's
trial,
they
--
they
concluded
that
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
this
was
to
end
the
siphoning
process,
which
they
did.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
i--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
one
being
that
what
--
one
thing
that
was
eliminated
was
the
spikes,
like
we
had
in
my
client's
month,
34.8,
even
though
the
average
underrepresentation
was
only
18.1.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
okay.
well,
in
the
case
of
duren,
you're
talking
about
--
they
had
a
10-month
period
that
was
involved,
but
as
for
the
numbers
being
small,
i
can
only
refer
you
to
cases
that
i
very
much
disagree
with
--
united
states
v.
sanchez-lopez,
cited
in
my
brief,
where
hispanics
comprised
5.59
percent
of
the
southern
district
of
idaho
--
and
the
court
basically
said:
since
that's
less
than
10
percent,
who
cares
if
there
are
hispanics
on
the
juries?
the
same
in
united
states--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--okay.
well,
first
of
all,
kent
county
is
not
really
that
big.
it's
--
anybody
can
drive
from
the
farthest
end
of
the
county
to
downtown
grand
rapids
in
approximately
20
to
30
minutes.
it
wouldn't
be
that
difficult
to
get
there.
i
bet
members
of
this
court
have
a
longer
commute.
but,
more
importantly,
the
--
the
fact
that
you're
only
talking
about
25
people
out
of
2,250
people
simply
means
that
the
problem
will
be
easy
for
court
administrators
to
solve,
if
they
have
an
incentive
to
do
it.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
the
statistics
showed,
for
example,
that
african-americans
had
a
much
higher
rate
of
not
having
an
automobile.
and
so
if
you
say,
well,
if
you
have
trouble
getting
a
ride,
you
could
tell
somebody,
come
on
down
anyway;
or
you
can
say,
that's
all
right,
take
the
day
off.
and
if
african
americans
have
a
very
substantial
higher
rate
of
single-parent
households,
well,
then,
of
course,
it's
going
to
be
harder
to
get
a
babysitter.
now,
you
can
tell
those
people,
well,
that's
okay,
stay
home;
or
you
can
say,
try
to
get
down
here
anyway.
and
the
court
--
and
if
somebody
simply
didn't
show
up,
statistics
have
shown,
in
the
brief--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--no
doubt
that
that's
true,
and
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
wrong
to
give
real
hardship
exemptions.
here--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
in
this
case,
one
of
the
things
that
happened
is
that,
if
somebody
didn't-simply
didn't
show
up,
that's
it.
now,
judges
--
the
court
administrator
said,
yes,
we
tried.
the
judges
would
issue
orders
to
show
cause,
but
the
police
department
made
a
decision
that
they
were
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
serving
or
participation
in
these
orders
to
show
cause,
orders
to
show
up.
and
isn't
that
police
department
decision
part
of
the
system?
it
is
systematic.
when
the
police--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--tell
the
courts
what
to
do,
shouldn't
the
courts
tell
the
police
what
to
do?
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
if
you
find
that
it
is
persistent,
month
in
and
month
out--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--then
you
have
a
problem
because
society
benefits
when
jurors
are
drawn
from
the
broadest
spectrum
of
the
system.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
overall,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
granting
excuses
for
genuine
hardship;
however,
when
you
have
this
factor
and
factor
2
and
factor
3
and
factor
4,
and
they
persistently
come
up
with
all-white
juries,
that's
what
richard
hillary
testified
to,
98
percent
of
the
time,
nothing,
but
all-white
juries.
and
if
somebody
could--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
there
is
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
michigan
that
covers
a
very
large
amount
of
territory,
and,
frankly,
i
have
not
studied
their
statistics,
but
i
know,
from
personal
knowledge,
that
the
african
american
population
in
the
western
district
of
michigan
would
be
smaller
than
in
kent
county
or
in
the
city
of
grand
rapids,
where--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--well,
if
you
mean
the
united
states
district
court--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--no,
i
--
i
have
not
studied
that
situation,
and--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--i
don't
know
of
a
court
that
arrests
people,
and
i
--
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
a
question
of
arresting.
the
local
judges
made
a
decision:
we
are
going
to
issue
orders
to
show
cause;
people
will
be
required
to
come
in.
the
police
decided,
no,
we're
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
and
i
feel
that
that's
part
of
the
system
because
the
police
are
part
of
the
system.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
in
order
to
solve
this
problem,
all
that
kent
county
would
have
to
do
is
to,
if
you
take
people
to
district
court,
put
back
the
ones
that
aren't
being
used.
that
would
certainly
help,
but,
instead,
they
take
an
excess
number,
like
any
court
does,
but
the
excess
people
are
totally
removed
from
the
system.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
that
is
what's
happening,
but
i
don't
believe--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--we
know
that
the
--
as
soon
as
they
stopped
doing
it,
this
created
a
substantial
increase
in
the
number
of
african-americans
on
the
juries,
and
i
think
that
that's--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--at
the
county
level.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
yes.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
okay.
the
--
well,
it
is
in
the
testimony
of
--
well,
if
you
look,
it's
--
i'm
sorry
that
i
don't
have
the
page
number,
but
right
at
the
time,
it
was
said,
we
have
two
or
three
african
--
americans
within
this
group,
that
was
either
60
or
100.
and
i'm
sorry
that
the
record
is
less
clear,
but
even
if
it
is
3
out
of
60,
you're
talking
about
5
percent,
whereas
the
population
is
7.28
percent.
if
it
just
happens
once
or
twice--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--not
a
problem,
but
it
happens
every
month.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
if
there
were
two
more,
it
would
be
right
on
target,
just
--
it
would
only
be.28
percent
low,
which,
if
you
simply
send
out
a
second
letter,
because
the
testimony
of
kim
foster
was
that,
later
on,
when
they
started
sending
out
the
second
letter,
half
of
the
people
who
did
not
respond
would
respond--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--but
it's
a
step
in
the
right
direction,
and
what
we
want
to
do
is
we
want
to
promote
more
minority
participation
on
jurors
--
juries,
instead
of
creating
a
rule
that
tells
court
administrators
all
over
the
country,
the
heat's
off,
you
don't
have
to
do
anything.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
one
element
of
the
entire
system
might
be
insignificant,
but
you
are
talking
about
numerous
elements
that
went
together,
and
duren
says
they
have
to
show
what
caused
the
underrepresentation.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
each
district,
the
jurors
are
acquired
from
that
district--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--and
the
circuit
is
acquired
from
all
the
districts
of
the
county.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
i
don't
expect
those
outlying
districts
to
have
more
--
a
larger
percentage
of
blacks
than
the
population;
i'm
only
expecting
that
from
the
county.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
i
think
that
we
should
allow
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
to
local
court
administrators.
as
i
mentioned
in
the
brief,
in
the
parents
involved
in
community
schools
case,
there
was
a
discussion
in
the
concurrence
by
justice
kennedy
about
exactly
what
local
governments--
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
--can
do
to
--
to
get
an
appropriate
representation
of
minorities
without
using
racial
classifications.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
i
admit
that
it
is
a
different
setting.
however,
i
feel
--
well,
no,
i
won't
say
"i
feel".
duren
holds
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
connection
between
the
african-americans
that
appear
on
the
jury
arrays
and
the
population
as
a
whole.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
well,
you
are
certainly
correct,
and
i
would
simply
say
that
the
people
of
grand
rapids
looked
up
at
the
juries;
98
percent
of
the
time
they
saw
nothing
but
white
faces.
i
think
that
duren
requires
that
the
local
system
do
something
about
it.
there's
a
lot
of
options.
so
you
should
give
them
flexibility.
mr.
james
sterling
lawrence
thank
you,
your
honor.
