justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
don't
have
any
urns
here.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
wrong--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
what's
wrong
with
a
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
a
rule?
with
picking
a
number,
rather
than
leaving
it
up
to
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
district
courts
to
use
different
numbers,
different
times?
i
don't
have
to
review
all
of
these
cases
all
the
time.
why
don't
we
pick
a
number?
you
want
10,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
why
las
vegas
makes
a
profit,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
to
be
a
--
a
resident
of
the
district
in
order
to
serve
as
a
juror
in
the
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
if
this
system
were
not
in
effect,
and
if
grand
rapids
had
to
take
white
jurors
from
other
counties
as
opposed
to
a
larger
percentage
of
black
jurors
from
grand
rapids,
then
you'd
have
a
claim
in
grand
rapids,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
--
you'd
have
a
jury
pool
in
grand
rapids
that
wouldn't
reflect
the
larger
number
of
blacks
in
grand
rapids.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
damned
if
you
do
and
damned
if
you
don't,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
--
if
that
statement
is
true,
then
--
then
there
is
--
there's
no
third
part
to
the
three-part
test.
i
thought
duren
established
a
three-part
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
third
one
was
that
you
had
to
establish
--
after
having
already
established
the
disparity,
you
had
to
establish
that
there
was
a
selection
process
which
caused
the
disparity.
and
you
are
telling
us
that
you
don't
have
to
proceed
to
step
3.
once
you
show
the
disparity,
it
is
assumed
that
it
is
the
product
of
the
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
third
test?
please
tell
me
how
you
reconcile
that
statement
with
the
fact
that
it
did
set
forth
a
three
--
a
three-prong
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sterling,
i
don't
--
you
seem
to
acknowledge
that,
to
make
your
case,
you
have
to
show
that
grand
rapids
district
drew
from
the
pool
a
disproportionate
number
of
people.
why
--
why
do
you
have
to
prove
that?
if
grand
rapids
contributes
to
the
pool
an
inordinate,
disproportionate
number
of
the
minority
--
blacks
in
this
case
--
even
if
grand
rapids
simply
took
back
a
proportionate
number
from
the
pool,
it
would
still
have
a
disproportionate
effect
on
reducing
the
number
of
blacks
in
the
overall
pool,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
a
step
--
a
step
in
the
right
direction
is
not
enough.
you
were
adducing
that
to
prove
that
the
prior
system
had
a
significant
effect,
and
it
turned
out,
it
didn't
have
a
very
significant
effect.
it
doesn't
prove
your
point
to
say,
well,
it's
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
if
it's
insignificant,
it's
insignificant.
whether
it's
insignificant
in
the
right
direction
or
the
wrong
direction
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
still
don't
--
i
don't
understand
this
problem
of
--
of
you
have
to
show
that
they
took
back
more
than
they
contributed.
let's
assume
that
grand
rapids
is
--
is
entirely
black,
and
its
entire
delegation
that
goes
to
the
pool
are
all
black,
okay?
and
let's
assume
that
those
blacks
are
10
percent
of
the
--
the
totality,
and
there
are
no
blacks
from
anywhere
else,
okay?
then
grand
rapids
takes
back
simply
the
number
of
people
it
--
it
took,
its
set,
which
would
be
10
percent,
and
it
takes
black
--
takes
back
all
of
the
blacks,
who
are
the
grand
rapids
residents.
all
of
the
other
districts
would
thereby
have
zero
percent
blacks
instead
of
10
percent,
which
is
what
they
ought
to
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
so
why
expect
the
other
districts
to
have
10
percent
blacks
simply
because
grand
rapids
contributed
10
percent
of
the
totality,
all
of
whom
were
black?
there
--
then
there's
a
requirement
for
each
district
to
have
10
percent
blacks,
right?
but
if
grand
rapids
takes
back
its
--
its
--
the
people
it
sent,
there
are
no
more
blacks
left
to
go
around.
