justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
i
suppose
the
thrust
of
justice
stevens's
question
was
that
if
you
have
a
very
small
population
that
we
are
concerned
with,
then
the
disparity
can
be
very
substantial,
especially
if
you
use
the
comparative
disparity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
--
at
least,
i
was
interested
in
that
aspect
of
his
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
we
have
a
halfhour.
i'd
kind
of
like
to
know
how
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
systematic
exclusion
--
and
we
are
assuming
good
faith,
no
intent
to
discriminate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
systematic
exclusion
is
always
proven
or
disproven
by
statistics?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i'll
--
i'll
allow
you
to
answer,
of
course,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
not,
how
do
we
show
systematic
exclusion?
again,
assuming
good
faith,
no
intent
to
discriminate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
get
that.
if
--
if
a
procedure
routinely
results
in
statistical
underrepresentation
that
is
significant,
is
that
not
a
clear
showing
of
systematic
exclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
yes
--
no,
that's
--
it's
a
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
routinely
results
in
significant
underrepresentation,
then
that
is
automatically
systematic
exclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
isn't
the
--
i'm
trying
to
think
about
the
third
prong
of
--
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
duren.
isn't
--
if
it's
routine
and
it's
predictable
and
it's
constant,
isn't
that
always
due
to
systematic
exclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
policy.
can't
you
say
that
that
is
systematic
exclusion
because
it's
part
of
the
system?
