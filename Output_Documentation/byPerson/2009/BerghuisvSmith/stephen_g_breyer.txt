justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
--
i
don't
know
if
this
is
relevant
or
how
to
use
it,
but
years
ago,
i
took
a
course
in
this
kind
of
thing
at
the
kennedy
school.
i
was
teaching,
and
they
said
the
only
way
you
could
figure
out
what
--
what's
what
here
is
you
use
something
called
1,000
balls,
and
60
of
them
are
red,
and
940
are
black,
and
then
you
select
them
at
random,
and
--
and
12
at
a
time.
you
know,
fill
12
--
fill
a
hundred
with
12
in
each.
and
when
we
tried
to
do
that,
just
for
the
interest
of
it,
i
--
i
found
that
you
would
expect,
with
these
numbers,
something
like
a
third
to
a
half
of
juries
would
have
at
least
one
black
person
on
it.
now,
that
may
be
wrong,
because
i
am
not
a
mathematician,
but
--
but
putting
that
together,
it
looks
as
if
there
is
a
pretty
big
disparity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
other
hand,
that
isn't
what
they
testified
to,
so
i
guess
you're
going
to
tell
me
just
ignore
it
and
forget
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
know,
maybe
it's
the
only
way
to
do
it,
that
the
statistician
stays
with
these
urns,
which
i
guess
they
have
computer
programs
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
don't
know,
in
other
words,
and
maybe
i
should
just
--
i
hate
to
write
something,
like,
saying
2
and
2
is
6.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
you
can
skip
it,
if
you
want.
if
there's
any
comment,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
the
one
thing
i
learned
from
the
urn
business
is
it
never
turns
out
the
way
you
think.
[laughter]
for
example,
it
had
the
example
of,
like,
the
eight:
there
are
eight
out
of
a
hundred,
and
you
run
this
thing
a
thousand
times,
and
you'll
discover
that
there
is
one
black
juror
on
about
half
the
juries,
or
a
third,
anyway.
that's
much
more
than
i
would
have
thought
intuitively.
and
i
might
not
have
even
read
the
example
correctly.
so
you
see
why
i
--
i'm
at
sea,
as
soon
as
you
tell
me
to
be
a
statistician.
i
even
got
a
book
called
statistician
for
lawyers.
that
didn't
help
me
very
much.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so,
is
there
anybody
who
said
whether
--
if
all
--
they
all
take
their
jurors
first,
the
districts,
and
grand
rapids
uses
a
higher
percentage
of
jurors.
so
now
there
--
and
they
have
more
of
the
black
jurors,
so
that
there
are
fewer
left
over--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
could
be.
now,
is
there
any
--
in
this
record,
does
anybody
say
whether
that's
okay
or
not?
i
mean,
to
--
to
have
people
serve
jury
duty
near
where
they
live
or
nearer
where
they
live,
on
its
face,
is
not
so
bad.
did
--
did
anybody
say
whether
this
is
good
or
bad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why
is
it
--
i'm
just
not
clear
in
my
mind.
why
is
this
siphoning
bad?
my
impression,
which
may
be
wrong,
is
you
--
you
have
a
thousand
people
in
the
room,
let's
say,
and
if
you
let
the
district
courts
choose
first,
people
will
serve
nearer
where
they
live.
now
--
and
so
most
of
them
would
rather
serve
nearer
where
they
live.
and
the
result
of
that
could
be,
for
the
reasons
that
were
stated,
that
then
there
are
fewer
minorities
on
the
more
general
jurors
that
draw
from
a
wider
area,
and
i
don't
know
about
the
merits
of
that.
i
mean,
i
see
a
negative,
and
i
see
a
positive.
so
is
it
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
obviously
bad,
nor
is
it
obviously
good.
so
what
should
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
--
but
that's
just
the
explanation
of
the
problem
that
we're
seeing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
we're
seeing
is
that
if
grand
rapids
has
a
higher
juror
utilization
rate
and
they
have
a
higher
minority
population,
then
you
will
end
up
with
the
leftover
juries
having
a
lower
minority
population.
now,
the
explanation
for
that
is
that
you
choose
the
district
judges
--
you
choose
the
district
jurors
first.
my
question
to
you
is:
i
--
if
you're
just
a
--
i'm
not
instructed
in
this
area.
if
you
were
just
to
tell
me,
what
do
i
think
of
that,
i
would
say
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
you
have
fewer
minorities,
that's
true,
but
people
get
to
serve
closer
to
home.
now
--
now,
can
you
enlighten
me
a
little
bit
about
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that,
but
i
still
haven't
--
i
will
try
again.
forget
the
cases.
as
i'm
hearing
this,
all
i'm
hearing
is:
well,
if
you
let
the
--
if
you
say
that
the
wider
area
should
choose
first,
you
will
get
a
higher
number
of
minorities,
but
very
tiny
number;
i
mean
a
very
small
addition,
one
or
two
people.
and
if
you
do
it
the
way
they're
doing
it,
you'll
lose
those
one
or
two
people,
but
you
will
let
people
serve
closer
to
home.
so
i
just
think
--
as
a
person,
not
as
a
judge
--
that's
why
i
am
letting
you
answer
it
as
a
judge
--
but
i
mean,
i'd
say,
well,
it
doesn't
sound
like
much
of
a
big
deal.
and
--
and
i
do
see
an
advantage
in
this,
of
the
way
they
are
doing
it,
so,
now,
you
tell
me
what's
--
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
the
--
the
more
i
listen,
the
more
i
think
you
think
there
are
a
lot
of
things
people
could
do.
they
could
send
three
letters;
they
could
explain
in
the
letters
why
it's
important
to
come;
they
could
try
reversing
the
thing
a
little
bit
with
the
districts
first
or
not
first
--
all
kinds
of
things.
but
what
--
but
now
you're
forcing
them
into
this
legal
rubric.
so
what
about
a
decision,
which
you
wouldn't
like,
probably,
but
it
would
say
we
can't
say
that
they're
unreasonable
in
respect
to
not
having
all
of
these,
but
there
--
who
knows?
you
know,
when
they
get
around
and
others
try
them,
et
cetera.
in
other
words,
unreasonable/reasonable
is
one
standard,
and
ambiguity
plays
a
--
a
role
here,
too,
that
might
be
helpful.
