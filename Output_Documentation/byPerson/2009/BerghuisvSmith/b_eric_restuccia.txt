mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
really
a
case
about
the
law
of
habeas
corpus
for
this
murder
conviction
that
was
obtained
in
the
michigan
courts.
the
issue
was
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court
unreasonably
applied
clearly
established
supreme
court
precedent
in
rejecting
mr.
smith's
claim
that
his
jury
was
not
drawn
from
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community.
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
act
unreasonably
in
concluding
that
there
was
no
unconstitutional
underrepresentation
and
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion.
this
court's
decision
in
duren
did
not
require
a
different
result
on
either
point,
and
this
court
should
reverse
the
sixth
circuit.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
there
are
two
prongs
at
issue:
the
fair
and
reasonable
representation
prong
and
the
systematic
exclusion
prong.
and
it's
also
significant
to
understand
that
the
disparities
at
issue
here
are
relatively
small,
that
the
time
period
at
issue
runs
from
--
from
april
of
1993
to
october
of
1993,
where
there
was
information
--
for
those
6
months
for
which
the
processes
at
play
were
measured.
and
the
percentage
of
african-americans
that
appeared
in
the
venires
during
that
time
period
was
--
they
comprised
6
percent
of
the
venires,
where
the
jury-eligible
population
was
7.28
percent.
so
your
--
so
there
was
a
1.28
percent
absolute
disparity
during
this
6-month
time
period.
that
can
also
be
measured
as
an
18
percent
comparative
disparity.
now,
if
you
compare
that
to
the
disparities
that
are
issue
--
at
issue
in
duren,
they
really
are
a
magnitude
of
difference,
that
the
disparities
in
duren
involve
the
exclusion
of
women
in
missouri,
where
they
comprised
--
women
comprised
54
percent
of
the
population
and
only
14.5
percent
of
the
venires
over
an
8-month
period
of
time.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
well--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
if
you're
looking
at
the
michigan
supreme
court
decision,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
it's
not
just
that
it
would
have
to
be
incorrect;
it
would
have
to
be
objectively
unreasonable
under
the
aedpa
standard,
that
what's
at
issue
here
is
did
the
michigan
supreme
court
unreasonably
apply--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--yes.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
right.
that
it's
not
unreasonable,
and
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
the
fact
that
this
decision
was
not
unreasonable
is
i
--
in
the
blue
brief,
i
put
together
a
table
of
what
the
other
circuits
have
done
with
comparable
statistical
disparities.
and
it
runs
--
from
the
first
circuit
through
the
tenth
circuit,
i
have
seven
circuits'
worth
of
opinions,
and
of
course,
there
really
are
additional
cases,
if
you
examine
this.
and
if
you
look
at
the
kinds
of
disparities
that
have
been
examined
by
other
courts
on--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
the
--
in
my
view,
this
court
really
didn't
provide
guidance
in
duren
about
how
this
should
be
measured.
in
fact,
duren
doesn't
specify
what
kind
of
measurement
tools
should
be
used
for
examining
disparity.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
well,
i
think
that's
right.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
on
direct
review
the
courts
are
virtually
unanimous
in
rejecting
these
kinds
of
small
disparities.
so
if
you
look
at
the
table
on
pages
32
and
33,
the
circuits,
on
direct
review,
that
were
most
comparable
were
the
second
circuit
decision
in
which
the
percentage
of
the
distinct
group
in
the
community
was
7.08
percent
and
in
the
jury
pool
it
was
5.0
percent--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
right.
at
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
as
kind
of
the
first
matter,
it
seems
like
this
court
doesn't
have
to
really
reach
that
hard
question,
insofar
as
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
is
entitled
to
deference
under
aedpa,
meaning--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--okay.
no,
i
understand.
i
understand.
i
just
want
to
make
that
as
kind
of
a
first
point.
now,
for
the
second
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
absolute
disparity
test
is
the
better
measure
for
examining
--
examining
these
questions.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
objectively
captures
the
number
of
missing
jurors
that
are
part
of
the
venire,
whereas
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--7.28.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
the
10
percent
test
is
not
really
necessarily
tied
to
the
absolute
disparity.
in
other
words,
this
court
could
conclude
that
the
absolute
disparity
test
is
the
better
test
without
using
that
10
percent
threshold.
the
reason
i
suggest
the
10
percent
threshold
is
that's
really
what's
happening
on
the
ground
in
the
federal
courts.
it's
very
hard
to
find
a
case
in
which
there's
a--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
right.
under
--
if
this
court
adopted
it--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
right.
if
the
court--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--it
reflects
the
actual
practice
of
the
courts
because
of
the
--
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
the
--
it
seems
--
looking
at
what
the
federal
courts
have
done,
they've
all
--
they've
generally
used
multiple
tests.
now,
there
are
several
circuits
that
have
relied
on
this
10
percent
threshold,
but
it's
not
necessary
for
the
state
to
prevail
in
order
for
this
court
to
adopt
the
10
percent
threshold.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
i
--
i
understand
that
point.
the
reason
that
i'm
suggesting
a
threshold
also
is
it
corresponds
to
a
practical
aspect
of
the
application
of
these
rules.
the
--
if
you
have
a
sufficiently
small
absolute
disparity,
as
a
matter
of
probability,
it's
not
likely
to
affect
the
actual
composition
of
the
petit
jury.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
well
--
and
one
of
the
concerns
i
have
is
i
--
for
example,
i
know
in
kent
county
that
if
you
look
at
the
other
distinct
groups-you
look
at
the
1990
census
for
kent
county,
it
was
comprised
of
2
point
--
2.9
percent
latino-americans,
1.1
percent
asian-americans,
and
0.6
percent
native
americans.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
one
month
that's
been
placed
at
issue,
in
which
mr.
smith
is
indicating
that
there
was
a
35
percent
comparative
disparity
for
that
one
month,
if
that
becomes
the
threshold,
the
standard
used,
which
the
sixth
circuit
concluded
was
--
established
a
violation
of
the
second
prong,
then
if
you
think
about
the
practical
application
that
--
for
michigan,
for
kent
county,
if
you
take
your
158
jurors
in
that
jury
pool,
you'd
expect
for
that
one
month
for
there
to
be
four
or
five
latino-americans,
two
asian
--
americans,
and
one
native
american.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
what's
missing
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
what's
wrong
with
what?
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that
what
was
i--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that
has
been
the
practice
of
the
courts
below.
that's
why
i'm
--
i'm
advocating
it.
but
it
does
correspond
to
this
idea
that
below
a
certain
point,
absolute
disparity
will
have
no
practical
--
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
venire
at
issue,
according
to
the
state
trial
court,
included
60
prospective
jurors,
and
there
were
three
african
--
americans,
which
would
then
constitute
5
percent.
now,
in
order
for
that
percentage
to
correspond
exactly
to
the
jury-eligible
population,
there
would
had
to
have
been
one
or
two
more
african
--
american
jurors
as
part
of
that
venire.
well,
as
a
matter
of
probability,
if
you
have
12
being
selected
from
60
--
this
is
kind
of
your
point,
justice
breyer
--
that
it's
not
--
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
would
have
no
effect
on
the
actual
selection
of
the
petit
jury--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--i
think
that's
right.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
reasons,
also
--
talking
about
this
10
percent
as
a
rule
--
is
that
if
you
look
through
these
cases,
you'll
see
a
lot
of
--
a
lot
of
the
courts,
on
direct
review
--
and
i
think
--
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
this
point,
that
this,
of
course,
is
an
aedpa
case,
so
the
question
is
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court
acted
unreasonably.
and
so
i
think
there's
a
different
standard,
that
it
doesn't
have
to
have
gotten
it
right;
it
had
to
have
been
objectively
unreasonable.
but
setting
that
aside,
you'll
find
many
cases
in
which
there
are
disparities
of
5
percent
and
7
percent
which
have
been
rejected.
and
the
reason
is
you
have
neutral
processes,
processes
that
everyone
would
agree
are
reasonable
on
their
face,
which
result
in
disparities
for
distinct
groups.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
no.
i'm
making
just
the
--
the
opposite
point,
that
under
the
third--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
please.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
the
duren
case
involved
a
categorical
distinction,
meaning
women
were
exempted
in
a
different
way
than
men.
women
had
an
automatic
exemption.
this
court
didn't
delineate
in
duren
that
if
you
had
just
a
disparate
impact
based
on
a
neutral
process,
that
that
would
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
systematic
exclusion.
and
that's
really
been
the
way
the
federal
courts
have
applied
it
on
direct
review,
that
there--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--i
think
that
may
be
the
easiest
way
to
resolve
this
case,
because
under
the
third
prong,
the
michigan
supreme
court
on
the
question
of
jury
assignment
concluded
that
mr.
smith
had
failed
to
factually
show
that
there
was
any
underrepresentation
that
arose
from
that
process.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
the
--
the
information
that
mr.
smith's
expert
provided
is
he
--
he
had
--
there
are
two
jury
terms
that
were
described,
one
for
6
months,
in
which
this
juror
assignment
to
the
local
courts
first
occurred,
and
then
1
year
for
the
following
year,
in
which
the
jury
assignment
did
not
send
them
to
the
local
courts
first.
so
you
have
two
different
pools
that
are
being
compared.
the
--
if
you
look
at
page
13
of
the
blue
brief,
it
outlines
what
the
disparity
was
according
to
mr.
smith's
expert
for
the
time
which
the
assignment
to
local
courts
occurred.
and
in
that
diagram,
it
shows,
at
the
end,
that
there
was
an
18
percent
comparative
disparity.
and
that's
the
final
column
in
the
totals.
now,
that's
what
occurred
at
the
time
of
which
the
jury
assignment
to
the
local
courts
occurred
first.
the
following
year,
the
comparative
disparity
was
15
percent,
where
the
--
where
the
jurors
were
not
sent
to
local
courts
first.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
difference
of
a
3
percent
comparative
disparity.
now,
no
one
suggests
that
a
3
percent
comparative
disparity
could
--
could
justify
a
claim
of
a
violation
of
duren.
it's
--
it's
not
statistically
significant,
because
when
you
talk
about
3
percent
comparative
disparity
or
4
percent
comparative
disparity,
you
are
talking
about
two
or
three
jurors
over
the
entire
time
period--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no.
there
--
there
was
no
information
--
the
reason
--
the
michigan
supreme
court
ultimately
rejected
the
claim
on
the
jury
assignment
process
because
there
was
no
evidence
other
than
anecdotal
testimony
about
how
sending
jurors
to
local
courts
would
result
in
a
deficiency
of
african
--
americans
in
the
circuit
court
or
the
felony
court
--
courts.
so
that
was
the
basis.
they
--
so
in
a
way,
this
touches
on
wood
v.
allen.
it
was
a
factual
determination,
whether
it's
under
2254(d)(2)
or
2254(e)(1).
the
michigan
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
mr.
smith
had
failed
to
show
factually
that
there
was
any
underrepresentation
that
arose
from
the
jury
assignment
process
is
entitled
deference.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
no.
there's
--
there's
no
logical
necessity
that
sending
courts
--
because
you
understand
that
you
have
the
entire
county,
and
the
county
is
then
broken
up
into
districts?
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
and
the
districts
are
the
local
courts,
and
they
are
misdemeanor
courts.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
right.
but
all
those
other
outlying
areas
also
have
to
send
their
jurors
to
the
district
court
first,
too.
it's
not
like
it's
just
one
segment
gets
sent
to
the
district
court.
all
of
the
jurors
get
sent
to
the
district
courts
first.
the
only
--
the
--
the
proof
required
to
show
that
somehow
the
district
court
for
grand
rapids
went
through
more
jurors
than
did
the
other
local
courts
proportionately--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--no,
they
were
--
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
district
courts
--
grand
rapids,
rockford,
all
of
these
small
municipalities
--
drew
from
the
circuit
court
pool.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
exactly.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
in
other
words,
the
proof--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
all
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
it
does
take
grand
rapids
people,
that's
right.
that's
how
it
happens.
you're
drawing
from
the
entire
county.
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
if
i've
--
if
i've
stated
it
in
a
way
that's
misleading.
i
apologize.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
all
of
the
jurors
from
the
entire
county
are
drawn
into
one
pool.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
and
then
the
--
the
local
courts
can
identify
those
people
that
came
from
within
their
jurisdiction
and
draw
them
out.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
everyone
does
it.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
the
--
there's
no
information
to
--
in
the
record--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that
indicates
that.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
no.
the
--
the
district
court
for
grand
rapids
had
to
be
grand
rapids
residents.
you're
exactly
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
it
all
depends
on
the
local
courts
and
their
usage
of
jurors.
if
--
if
grand
rapids
actually
required
fewer
jurors,
it
would
--
it
would
result
in
a
larger
number
of
african-americans
being
present
on
the
circuit
court.
the
whole
concept
underlying
the
claim
that
--
that
this
had
a
disproportionate
effect
is
the
idea
that
grand
rapids
must
have
needed
proportionately
more
jurors
than
the
other
local
courts
might.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that
would
be
the
argument.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
well,
there
wasn't
really
testimony
whether
it
was
good
or
bad.
the
--
the
anecdotal
information
was
that
it
--
it
took
african
--
american
jurors
out
of
the
larger
pool.
the
anecdotal
information
from
the
court
administrator
was:
we
were
afraid
this
process
was
draining
--
"siphoning"
was
the
language
--
siphoning
jurors
from
the
circuit
court.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
yes.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
it
would
create
a
problem
in
grand
rapids.
that's
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
nothing
other
than
the
anecdotal
testimony.
like,
for
example,
the
court
administrator
said
it
is
believed
that
this
process
results
in
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
jurors
--
of
african-american
jurors--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
right.
and
that
information
was
not
provided,
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
the
michigan
supreme
court
rejected
the
claim
factually,
that
it
had
not
been
demonstrated.
and,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
information
that
mr.
smith's
expert
put
forward,
it
really
confirms
that
the
--
even
the
best
showing
for
mr.
smith
is
a
very
small
correlation.
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
a
3
or
4
percent
comparative
disparity
difference.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
it
would
have
to
be
significant,
and
i
don't
think
there's--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--oh,
if
the--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--not
--
not
under
my
reading
of
duren.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
--
i
don't
think
that's
the
--
the
proper
rule.
and
i
--
the
reason--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--well,
i
--
i
don't
think
the
numbers
were
sufficient
to
justify--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
and
that's
the
argument
being
raised
by
mr.
smith.
no,
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
this:
you
have
--
the
federal
courts,
on
direct
review,
have
looked
at
voter
registration
and
challenges
to
voter
registration.
voter
registration
may
have
a
disparate
--
or
affect
distinct
groups
differently.
in
the
same
way
that
the
second
and
tenth
circuit
have
looked
at
cases
where
they
failed
to
follow
up
on
non-returns,
that
--
if
you
don't
follow
up
on
non-returns,
it
may
affect
distinct
groups
differently.
the
analysis
of
the
federal
courts
on
that
issue
has
been
that
the
decisions
to
exempt
yourself
from
jury
service
or
the
failure
to
respond
to
an
invitation
for
jury
service
is
outside
the
system.
even
if
it
occurs
regularly
and
is
persistent,
it's
still
not
inherent
in
the
process.
that's
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
said
here
about
the
excuses
for
hardship
and
transportation
--
for
the
excuses.
but
it's
also
true
that
the
process
by
which
you
select
jurors
in
district
courts
is
not
something
that
is
a
systematic
exclusion
of
anyone.
it's
--
on
its
face,
it
is
neutral,
and
if
you
--
if
this
court
concludes
that
neutral
practices
like
sending
out
--
using
a
certain
body,
whether
voter
registration
or
if
it's
driver's
licenses
and
michigan
identification
cards,
or
not
following
up
on
non-returns,
or
allowing
excuses
for
hardship,
or
--
or
assigning
jurors
to
a
district
court
first,
if
that
is
--
can
result
in
systematic
exclusion,
what's
going
to
happen
is
that
all
these
neutral
processes
that
michigan
has
may
result
in
disparities.
and
so,
as
it
stands
now,
kent
county
doesn't
identify
the
race
and
ethnicity
of
all
of
its
jurors.
well,
it's
going
to
have
to
if
it's
going
to
have
to
have
this
perfect
correspondence
of
the
juryeligible
population.
it
will
no
longer
have
this
kind
of
blind
neutrality--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
true.
there
is
--
there
is
then
the
rebuttal.
but
then
what
happens
is
you
are
subject
to
these
challenges.
the
question
is:
does
the
court
--
does
the
state
ever
wish
--
ever
wish
to
be
in
a
position
of
having
to
be
subject
to
the
challenge?
but
--
but
i
think
i
want
to
come
back
to
--
one
of
the
prevailing
points
of
all
of
this
is
that
this
is
also
the
michigan
supreme
court.
there's
no
question
that
it
had
reached
the
merits
and
was
entitled
to
aedpa
deference.
and
the
--
the
question
was:
was
there
adequate
guidance
to
the
state
of
michigan
to
know
that
this
was
both
systematic
--
that
this
was
systematic
exclusion
and
inherent
in
the
process?
and
duren
was
not
clear
on
that
point.
the
--
the
analysis
of
the
michigan
courts
really
corresponds
quite
closely
to
what
the
federal
courts
have
done,
so
it
cannot
be
objectively
unreasonable.
and
if
there--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--oh,
what
happens
if
you
don't
have
it
--
some
people
don't
have
a
right
to
a
driver's
license,
so
you
can
still
obtain
an
identification
card
even
if
you
are
not
able
to
drive.
so
it's
trying
to
get
as
wide
a
group
as
possible
for
your
pool
of
jurors.
and
if
there
are
no--
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
--that's
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
that's
right.
mr.
b.
eric
restuccia
i
just
have
two
brief
points.
one
is
that
--
i
want
to
just
remind
the
court
that
this
is
a
case
under
aedpa
review,
so
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
to
be
not
just
incorrect;
it
has
to
be
objectively
unreasonable.
and
its
conclusion,
i
think
probably
the
easiest
analysis
here
is
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
showing
of
systemic
exclusion,
because
mr.
smith
failed
to
show
that
there
was
any
underrepresentation
that
arose
from
the
jury
assignment
process,
is
probably
one
of
the
strongest
points,
because
if
you
look
at
the
3
percent
comparative
disparity,
that's
less
than
half
of
1
percent
absolute
disparity.
no
one
claims
that
that's
statistically
significant.
so
i
think
whether
it's
reviewed
under
2254(d)(2)
or
2254(e)(1),
this
court
should
reverse.
thank
you.
