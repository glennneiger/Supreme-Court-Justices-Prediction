chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1402,
berghuis
v.
smith.
mr.
restuccia.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
the
point
is,
just
following
up,
it's
not
that
you're
going
to
say
2
plus
2
is
6.
i
suppose,
under
aedpa,
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
2
plus
2
is
somewhere
between
3
and
5,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
does
depend,
doesn't
it,
on
the
size
of
the
--
the
urn?
in
other
words,
if
it's
a
smaller--
[laughter]
if
it's
10,000
of
these
balls
and
you
are
going
to
go
through
it
10,000
times,
it's
more
likely
that
you
are
going
to
get
a
sample
that
reflects
the
overall
percentage,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
that
--
i'm
confused.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
the
other
way
around.
i
thought
grand
rapids
gave
however
many
--
you
know,
30
percent
to
the
pool
and
then
took
grand
rapids
people
back?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
do
we
have
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
--
i
gather
this
whole
claim
depends
upon
grand
rapids
having
more
need
for
jurors
per
capita
than
anywhere
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
do
we
have
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
that's
the
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that's
something
we
can
find
out
pretty
easily,
right?
i
mean,
you
look
and
see
how
many
jurors
are
pulled
for
--
how
many
jurors
grand
rapids
needs
in
a
particular
period--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--compare
it
to
how
many
jurors
rockland
needs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lawrence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
had
a
community
with
one
african-american,
your
argument
would
be
the
same,
if
that's
the
disparity?
that
means
every
--
every
minority
is
left
off
the
jury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i'm
--
i
guess
i'm
echoing
justice
stevens's
question
of
whether
or
not
this
type
of
statistical
analysis
really
works
when
you're
dealing
with
relatively
small
numbers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
i
understand
your
siphoning
theory
to
depend
upon
grand
rapids
drawing
a
disproportionate
number
of
jurors
from
the
pool?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
results
in
fewer
minorities
going
up
to
the
county
court,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
removed
from
the
county--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--where
--
where
in
the
record
is
it
established
that
grand
rapids
had
a
disproportionate
need
for
jurors
from
the
pool?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
--
if
your
theory
depends
upon
grand
rapids
drawing
a
disproportionate
number
and
it
is
not
in
the
record
that
grand
rapids
drew
a
disproportionate
number,
i
think
that
means
you
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course.
of
course,
but
we
have
to
look
at
this
on
a
proportional
basis,
right?
grand
rapids
is
also
sending
a
higher
number
of
jurors
to
the
pool
than
--
than
the
small
rural
county.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
theory
depends
upon
grand
rapids
drawing
not
just
a
proportional
number,
if
it's
contributing
30
percent
and
it
draws
30
percent;
your
theory
depends
upon
grand
rapids
contributing
30
percent
to
the
pool
and
drawing
40
percent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that?
don't
those
people
then
have
to
become
professional
jurors?
they
have
to
serve
on
every
jury,
or
you're
going
to
have
the
disproportion
that
the
statistics
show.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
is
--
is
no,
right?
because
the
idea
is,
if
grand
rapids
sends
up
a
pool
that's
30
percent
minority
and
if
it
takes
back
the
same
number
as
everybody
else,
it's
going
to
get
--
the
county
is
going
to
get
the
same
proportion.
it's
only
when
they
take
back
more.
they
have
the
more
heavily
african-american
pool,
and
they
are
going
to
draw
from
it
more
than
everybody
else
is
drawing
from
theirs,
so
there
will
be
fewer
african
--
americans
to
go
to
the
county.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
have
no
evidence
that
grand
rapids
takes
back
more
than
its
share,
proportionally,
than
anybody
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
the
county
level?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
was
there
any
evidence
that
your
venire
--
that
minorities
were
underrepresented
on
your
venire?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
help
me--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--help
me
--
help
me
with
the
math.
if
there
were
one
more
african
--
american,
what
would
the
percentage
be?
pretty
close
to
what
you're
saying
it
should
be,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
restuccia,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-1402,
berghuis
versus
smith.
