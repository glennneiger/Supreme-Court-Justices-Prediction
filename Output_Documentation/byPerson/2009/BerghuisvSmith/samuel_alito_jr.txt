justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
statistical
issue
is
very
interesting,
but
i
--
i
wonder,
if
we
were
not
looking
at
this
through
aedpa,
why
we
--
why
a
court
should
necessarily
have
to
start
with
the
question
--
with
the
elements
of
the
prima
facie
--
with
the
question
of
whether
there
is
unconstitutional
underrepresentation,
when
in
the
end,
as
i
understand
duren,
the
defendant
has
to
identify
some
aspect
of
the
jury
selection
process
that
has
a
disproportionate
impact
on
the
group
involved
and
is
unreasonable?
and
unless
that
can
be
done
at
the
outset,
why
struggle
with
these
statistics?
now,
here,
to
illustrate,
the
aspect
of
the
jury
selection
process
that
the
sixth
circuit
thought
was
unreasonable
was
the
prior
practice
of
choosing
the
jurors
first
for
the
district
courts,
the
misdemeanor
courts,
rather
than
the
circuit
courts,
the
--
the
felony
courts.
but
the
--
the
trial
judge,
it
seemed
to
me,
address
this
in
--
in
a
very
thoughtful
way,
and
he
said
there
just
isn't
any
proof
that
this
old
system
had
that
effect.
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
it
could
have
that
effect,
unless
the
--
the
number
of
jurors
chosen
for
the
district
courts
in
grand
rapids
was
disproportionate
to
the
number
chosen
for
the
district
courts
in
the
other
jurisdictions
within
the
county.
so
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
end
of
the
case.
and
why
does
it
make
sense
to
--
to
struggle
with
this
rather
complicated
statistical
problem,
if
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it's
going
to
come
down
to
something
of
that
nature?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
concluding
that
it's
systematic
doesn't
mean
that
the
defendant
wins.
it
just
means
that
the
state
has
to
--
has
to
justify
the
--
the
mechanism
that's
causing
--
that's
causing
this
--
this
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
says
that
the
state
has
to
show
that
it
has
a
reason,
a
good
reason,
for
--
the
aspect
of
the
selection
process
that
has
been
identified
as
causing
the
disparity.
but
does
it
say
that
it's
the
state's
obligation
to
go
through
every
factor
that
may
cause
the
disparity
and
justify
every
one?
or
is
it
the
defendant's
obligation
to
point
to
some
aspect
of
the
selection
--
of
the
--
of
the
system
that
causes
the
disparity?
then
once
the
defendant
identifies
that,
then
the
state
can
show
if
it
--
can
try
to
show
that
there's
a
good
reason
for
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
the
only
factor
that
the
sixth
circuit
identified
as
illegitimate,
was
this
--
was
this
siphoning
system.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
rejected
everything
else,
didn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
there
--
are
there
courts
that
you
know
of
that
do
what
you
are
suggesting
needs
to
be
done?
when
a
juror
does
not
show
up,
the
judge
issues
a
bench
warrant,
and
--
and
the
police
are
sent
out
to
arrest
the
person
and
drag
the
person
into
court,
or
somebody
says,
i
am
a
single
parent,
and
i
have
children,
and
i'm
too
poor
to
have
a
nanny
or
an
au
pair,
and,
therefore,
please
excuse
me;
and
they
say,
no,
you
have
to
find
some
way
of
getting
here.
are
there
courts
that
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
the
case--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
--
if
grand
--
if
grand
rapids
uses
a
disproportionate
number
of
jurors
in
its
district
courts,
then
you
are
going
to
have
this
problem
--
the
only
way
to
fix
the
problem
would
be
to
have
a
separate
jury
system
for
the
district
courts.
if
you
have
the
--
the
circuit
courts
going
first,
then
the
people
in
the
district
courts
are
going
to
have
the
problem
that
you
identify.
if
you
have
a
system
in
which
it's
all
done
randomly
--
circuit
court,
district
court
--
the
people
who
come
toward
the
end
are
going
to
have
the
problem.
so
i
don't
see
any
way
out
of
this,
if
in
fact
there
was
a
statistical
basis
for
it,
other
than
having
a
separate
selection
process
for
the
district
courts.
is
that
what
you
think
is
necessary?
