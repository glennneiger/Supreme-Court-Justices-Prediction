justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
interested
in
--
in
two
different
things
and
you
can
address
them
during
the
course
of
your
argument.
one
is
the
assumption
of
the
argument
seems
to
be
that
there
are
in
place
parole
--
throughout
all
the
states
--
parole
systems
which
are
effective,
which
are
operating,
and
that
they
have
the
capacity
to
make
accurate
judgments
about
rehabilitation.
what
can
i
read
--
what
--
what
studies
do
you
have
to
--
that
--
that
comment
on
that?
secondly,
unrelated,
at
some
point
i
think
you
ought
to
talk
about
the
procedural
bar,
which
is
something
you
go
over
very,
very,
very
--
let's
see
--
that's
sullivan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pardon
me.
that's
sullivan,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
would
you
do
if
there
were
a
crime
spree
and
there
were
different
jurisdictions?
one
jurisdiction
imposes
for
35
years,
the
next
jurisdiction
for
another
35
years,
to
be
served
consecutively.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
second
jurisdiction
has
the
obligation,
but
not
the
first?
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
hear
the
second.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
look
just
at
deterrence,
my
initial
instinct
is
that
the
difference
in
life
and
life
without
--
life
with
parole
and
life
without
parole
is
just
not
a
factor
in
deterrence.
i
--
i
don't
know
how
i'd
confirm
that
one
way
or
the
other,
but
let's
--
let's
assume
that
there
is
some
basis
for
that
intuition.
then,
insofar
as
the
deterrence
prong
is
concerned,
since
it's
not
a
deterrent,
and
if
you
assume
that
there
is
rehabilitation,
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
keeping
the
accused,
the
--
the
defendant
in
custody
for
the
rest
of
his
life
if
he
has
been
rehabilitated
and
is
no
longer
a
real
danger?
what's
the
state's
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
could
say
retribution,
but
then
you
have
judges
on
a
case-by-case
basis
deciding
when
there
should
be
retribution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
the
deterrence
interest
is
quite
minimal
if
you
assume
rehabilitation
or
strong
evidence
of
rehabilitation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
just
a
little
bit
about
the
florida
correctional
systems,
the
policies
with
respect
to
rehabilitation
programs?
if
they
don't
have
parole,
then
you
might
say,
well,
they
don't
need
rehabilitation
programs
or
that
they
might
need
them
more.
had
the
rehabilitation
programs
been
increased
or
decreased
since
the
phasing
out
of
parole?
or
is
it
about
the
same?
or
are
they
--
are
they
non-existent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
a
juvenile
have
a
constitutional
right
to
hope,
but
an
adult
does
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
second
case
in
which
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
is
graham
versus
florida,
number
08-7412.
the
petitioner
jamar
graham
was
sentenced
by
the
state
of
florida
to
life
without
parole
for
armed
burglary
with
assault
or
battery,
a
crime
he
committed
at
the
age
of
16.
the
sentence
was
imposed
after
graham
was
charged
with
additional
serious
crimes
at
the
age
of
70.
he
challenges
his
sentence
under
the
eighth
amendment's
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause,
the
eighth
amendment's
prohibition
is
applicable
to
the
states
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
rejecting
graham's
eighth
amendment
challenge
the
first
district
court
of
appeal
of
florida
affirmed
the
judgment
and
sentence
and
we
now
review
that
ruling.
the
eighth
amendment
forbids
cruel
and
unusual
punishments.
the
concept
of
cruelty
is
not
merely
descriptive,
it
necessarily
embodies
a
moral
judgment.
to
determine
whether
a
punishment
is
cruel
or
unusual,
the
courts
must
look
beyond
historical
conceptions
to
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
mark
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society.
this
court's
precedents
establish
that
the
eighth
amendment
forbids
the
imposition
of
otherwise
permissible
punishments
when
they
are
disproportionate
to
the
offense
or
to
the
offender's
culpability.
the
present
case
involves
an
issue
the
court
is
not
considered
previously,
and
that
is
a
categorical
challenge
to
a
term
of
years
sentence.
here
the
sentencing
practice
itself
is
in
question
rather
than
the
application
of
a
particular
sentence
to
a
particular
defendant,
so
the
appropriate
analysis
is
a
categorical
one.
under
this
approach
the
court
must
determine
whether
there
is
a
national
consensus
against
the
sentencing
practice
at
issue
and
then
it
must
decide
and
exercise
of
its
own
independent
judgment
whether
the
punishment
violates
the
constitution.
the
laws
of
37
states
as
well
as
the
district
of
colombia
and
the
federal
government
permit
sentences
of
life
without
parole
for
juvenile
non-homicide
offender
in
some
circumstances,
13
states
do
not
allow
them.
relying
on
this
metric,
the
state
and
its
amici
who
filed
supporting
briefs
for
the
state,
argue
that
there
is
no
national
consensus
against
the
sentencing
practice
at
issue.
however,
an
examination
of
actual
sentencing
practices
in
jurisdictions
where
the
life
without
parole
for
juvenile
non-homicide
offenders
is
permitted
by
statute
discloses
a
consensus
against
its
use.
there
are
only
129
juvenile
non-homicide
offenders
serving
life
without
parole
sentences
across
the
nation.
a
significant
majority
of
those,
77
in
total,
are
serving
sentences
imposed
in
florida.
the
rest
are
in
prison
in
just
10
states
and
the
federal
system.
thus
only
12
jurisdictions
in
fact
sentence
juvenile
non-homicide
offenders
to
life
without
parole
and
most
of
those
imposed
the
sentence
quite
rarely.
well
26
states
as
well
as
the
district
of
columbia
do
not
impose
the
sentence
at
all
despite
apparent
statutory
authority.
although
we
recognize
a
consensus
against
the
use
of
this
sentence
the
task
of
interpreting
the
eighth
amendment
remains
our
responsibility.
our
cases
have
established
that
juveniles
have
lessened
the
culpability
and
so
are
less
deserving
of
the
most
severe
punishment.
it
is
also
well
settled
that
the
defendants
who
do
not
kill
or
intend
to
kill
are
less
deserving
of
the
most
severe
penalties.
it
follows
that
when
compared
to
an
adult
murderer
a
juvenile
offender
who
did
not
kill
or
intend
to
kill
has
a
twice
diminished
moral
culpability.
a
life
without
parole
sentence
is
the
second
harshest
sentence
available.
it
is
especially
hard
for
a
juvenile.
the
various
penalogical
justifications
for
life
without
parole
either
are
inapplicable
or
apply
with
weakened
force
to
juvenile
non-homicide
offenders.
these
offender's
diminished
moral
culpability
makes
the
sentence
disproportionate
on
retributive
grounds.
as
for
deterrence
juveniles
characteristics
make
it
less
likely
that
they
will
be
deterred
by
possible
punishments
than
adults
are.
incapacitation
is
an
impermissible
rationale
to
support
the
sentence
of
life
without
parole
because
it
requires
a
sentence
or
to
make
a
judgment
that
juvenile
is
incorrigible
at
the
outset
of
the
sentencing
and
as
made
clear
in
roper
versus
simmons,
the
characteristics
of
juveniles
make
those
judgments
questionable.
finally
life
without
parole
sentences
forswear
entirely
the
goal
of
rehabilitation.
defendants
serving
life
without
parole
sentences
are
often
denied
access
to
the
vocational
training
or
other
rehabilitative
services
that
are
available
to
other
inmates
and
for
juvenile
offenders
who
are
most
in
need
of
and
receptive
to
rehabilitation
the
absence
of
rehabilitation,
rehabilitative
opportunities
or
treatment
makes
the
disproportionality
of
the
sentence
all
the
more
evident.
penalogical
theory
is
not
adequate
to
justify
life
without
parole
for
juvenile
non-homicide
offenders.
this
determination,
the
limited
culpability
of
juvenile
non-homicide
offenders
and
the
severity
of
life
without
parole
sentences
all
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sentencing
practice
under
consideration
is
cruel
and
unusual.
the
court
now
holds
it
for
juvenile
offender
who
did
not
commit
homicide
the
eighth
amendment
forbids
the
sentence
of
life
without
parole.
the
state
need
not
guarantee
eventual
freedom
to
juveniles
convicted
of
non-homicide
crimes,
but
it
must
give
them
some
meaningful
opportunity
to
obtain
release
based
on
demonstrated
maturity
and
rehabilitation.
it
is
for
the
states
in
the
first
instance
to
explore
the
means
and
mechanisms
for
compliance.
the
judgments
of
other
nations
in
the
international
community
are
not
dispositive
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
amendment,
but
the
court
finds
support
for
its
conclusion
in
the
fact
that
the
united
states
in
continuing
to
impose
life
without
parole
sentences
on
juveniles
who
did
not
commit
homicides
adheres
to
a
sentencing
practice
rejected
the
world
over.
the
judgment
of
the
first
district
court
of
appeal
of
florida
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
stevens
is
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
sotomayor
joined.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
joins
and
in
which
justice
alito
joins
in
part.
justice
