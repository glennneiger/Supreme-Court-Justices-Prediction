justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
urging
that
in
all
cases,
including
homicide
cases?
or
are
you
drawing
the
line
at
homicide?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
a
fact
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
the
other
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
difference
in
the
terms
of
incarceration
making
this
harsher
than
otherwise?
i
think
you
suggested
in
--
in
your
brief
that
educational
and
vocational
training
is
not
given
to
people
who
are
in
for
life
without
parole
because
they
will
never
be
out
on
the
street
so
they
don't
need
to
be
transitioned
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
is,
first,
you
say
that
they
are
not
available.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
--
that's
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
are
the
terms
of
incarceration?
they
just
stay
in
their
cells
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
--
is
there
disproportionality
review
generally
in
florida
and
particularly
for
juvenile
offenders?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
that's
what
i
meant,
whether
you'd
have
to
create
a
--
a
procedure
that
does
not
exist
in
florida
for
proportionality
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
a
problem
with
that
argument
in
this
case,
because
the
sentencing
judge
made
it
quite
plain
that
he
was
treating
graham
as
a
recidivist,
not
as
a
first-time
offender.
he
said
--
graham
got
a
very
light
sentence,
just
12
months
in
detention
and
then
3
years'
probation,
and
the
judge
said:
now,
you
better
toe
the
line
or
else
you
could
be
put
away
for
a
long
time.
and
then
he
committed
--
it
really
was
--
the
sentence
was
for
the
later
activities,
even
though
they
weren't
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
that
graham
admitted
to
a
couple
of
--
to
more
armed
robberies.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
--
that's
one
of
the
problems,
is
the
individual
sentencing
judge
might
think
that
graham
is
a
very
bad
individual,
but
the
prosecutor
had
a
different
judgment
of
it.
and
florida
doesn't
have
any
kind
of
proportionality
review,
doesn't
have
any
review
--
appellate
review
of
the
sentences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
judge,
i
think,
surprised
everyone
in
the
courtroom
with
the
--
with
the
sentence.
certainly
it
was
far
beyond
what
the
prosecutor
recommended.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
no
one?
what
was
your
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
why
the
co-perpetrators
got
so
--
their
sentences
were
dramatically
lower.
do
we
know
why
that
was
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
he
assisted
the
prosecutor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
think
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
this
very
offense,
this
home
invasion,
i
didn't
think
that
anyone
other
than
graham
had
gotten
life
without
parole.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
--
how
do
you
answer
the
argument
that
unlike
an
adult,
because
of
the
immaturity,
you
can't
really
judge
a
person
--
judge
a
teenager
at
the
point
of
sentencing?
that
it's
only
after
a
period
of
time
has
gone
by,
and
you
see,
has
this
person
overcome
those
youthful
disabilities?
that's
why
a
proportionality
review
on
the
spot
doesn't
accommodate
the
--
what
is
the
driving
force
of
the
--
your
--
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
you
can't
make
a
judgment
until
years
later
to
see
how
that
person
has
--
has
done.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
florida
does
--
and
every
state
--
recognize
the
difference
between
an
adult
and
a
minor.
and
you
have
to
make
the
line.
we
have
it
at
18.
but
think
of
the
teenager
can't
drink,
can't
drive,
can't
marry.
there
are
so
many
limitations
on
children
just
because
they
are
children.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
don't
make
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
they
say
no
juvenile
can
drink
--
no
juvenile.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
question
is:
will
the
difference
between
life
with
parole
and
life
without
parole
deter
anybody?
i
mean
any
--
that
--
that's
what
we
are
talking
about.
and
i
don't
think
you
really
were
urging
that
that
difference
will
deter
the
teenager
so
he
might
think,
oh,
if
i
commit
this
violent
crime,
then
i
will
have
life
without
parole.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
there
was
a
parole
system
still
functioning,
so
--
although
it
will
be
phased
out
over
time,
but
for
people
who
were
incarcerated
under
the
old
regime
--
and
i
think
the
suggestion
was
that
that
system
would
take
care
of
the
handful
of
people,
not
more
than
that,
that
this
decision
would
involve.
