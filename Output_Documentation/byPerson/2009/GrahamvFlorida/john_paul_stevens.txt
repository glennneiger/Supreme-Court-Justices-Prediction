mr.
gowdy,
can
i
ask
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
client
in
this
case
had
been
processed
in
the
juvenile
system
instead
of
the
adult
system,
what
would
the
maximum
penalty
he
could
have
received
been?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
choice
is
between
that
short
a
term
and
an
indefinite
term?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this:
is
there
a
minimum
age
when
a
juvenile
can
be
transferred
to
--
to
adult
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
just
interested
in
one.
is
there
a
minimum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
an
arbitrary
line,
or
how
do
you
--
how
do
we
know
it
shouldn't
be
higher
or
lower
than
the
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
could
i
interrupt
with
one
question?
isn't
it
correct
that
the
age
is
relevant
on
whether
or
not
to
transfer
the
person
to
the
adult
system,
but
once
he's
in
the
adult
system,
age
is
entirely
immaterial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
don't
understand.
just
to
make
sure
i
get
the
point
correct:
after
the
decision
has
been
made
to
have
them
prosecuted
in
the
adult
system,
at
that
--
after
that
decision
has
been
made,
is
the
age
of
the
defendant
a
relevant
factor
in
sentencing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
statutorily?
as
a
matter--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
answer
is
no.
it's
--
under
the
statutes,
it's
totally
irrelevant
after
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
adult
stage.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
doesn't
draw
any
distinctions
once
he
is
in
--
in
the
adult--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
question?
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
amicus
briefs
in
this
case,
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
read
them
all
by
any
means.
do
any
of
the
briefs
or
any
of
the
materials
with
which
you
are
familiar
discuss
the
rate
of
--
the
difference
between
the
danger
of
recidivism
of
a
young
offender
and
one
who
is,
say,
40
or
50
years
old?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
sort
of
--
as
a
matter
of
intuition,
justice
kennedy
made
the
same
sort
of
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
older
people
are
less
likely
to
be
recidivists
than
the
younger
ones,
but
is
--
is
there
any
empirical
evidence
that
says
that's
an
incorrect
or
correct
judgment?
