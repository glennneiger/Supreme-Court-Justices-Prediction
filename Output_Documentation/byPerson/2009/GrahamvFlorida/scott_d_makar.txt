mr.
scott
d.
makar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
categorical
rule
that
petitioner
seeks
here
would
undermine
what
florida
and
other
states
have
adopted
in
terms
of
juvenile
justice.
and
in
particular,
it
would
go
against
three
major
trends,
that
being
strong
punishment
for
serious
violent
crimes
by
juveniles;
second
trend,
transfer
laws
allowing
juveniles
to
be
treated
as
adults;
those
laws
have
been
enacted
in
the
last
15
years--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
agree
in
florida
and
other
states
as
well
that
age
does
matter,
and
we
ask
that
there
be
three
things
that
the
court
look
at.
first,
look
at
the
legislative
structure.
florida
structure
doesn't
--
florida
structure
is
a
very
balanced,
thoughtful
approach,
in
waiving
children
into
the
adult
court
only
when
it's
a
violent
crime
and
only
under
certain
--
when
certain
ages
are
in
play.
look
at
the
age.
it
does
play
a
role.
the
judicial
discretion
plays
a
role.
the
trial
judge--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--it's
a
three-tiered
system,
justice
stevens.
and
let
me--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--yes.
the
way
in
which--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
the
legislature
has
set
the
line
at
14-15
for
certain
crimes
and
16-17
for
others.
and
then
for
indictment,
where
it
goes
to
a
grand
jury,
there
is
no
age
limitation.
that
has
been
on
our
books
for
the
better
part
of
50,
60
years,
allowing
indictment
--
allowing
the
grand
jury
to
make
a
decision
about
whether
the
particular
juvenile
shall
be
brought
into
the
adult
court.
so--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
sure.
and
as
i
say,
there's
the
three
factors
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at.
first,
the
structure
that
we
have
here
in
florida,
which
many
states
have,
that
deal
with
the
age.
age
does
matter.
ninety-nine
out
of
100
juvenile
offenders
in
our
system
do
not
go
into
adult
court,
and
an
even
smaller
percentage
of
that
ultimately
get
into
the
adult
sanctions.
the
trial
judges
in
florida,
unless
--
unless
it's
a
very
violent
crime,
have
some
discretion
to
sentence
as
to
age.
if
you
look
at
the
transcript
here
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
trial
judge
here
struggled
with
this,
struggled
with
age,
and
said:
juvenile
sanctions
are
inappropriate;
youthful
offenders
--
youthful
offender
sanctions
are
inappropriate;
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
to
--
to
adult.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
that's
not
accurate,
justice
stevens.
under
the
statute
985.226,
227,
and
225,
we
have
a
system
in
which
the
grounds
are
set
for
when
juveniles
can
be
either
mandatorily
or
discretionarily
brought
into
the
adult
system.
and
then
under
the
statute
985,
the
punishment
is
graduated.
in
other
words,
for
the
lower
offenses,
the
juvenile
sanctions
must
be
considered
and
the
youthful
offender
sanctions
must
be
considered.
it's
only
in
certain
limited
instances,
like
indictment,
where
it's
a
life
offense,
where
the
juvenile
has
been
indicted
for
life,
that
the
trial
judge
is
forced
to
do
adult
sanctions.
in
this
case,
graham
was
under
the
discretionary
direct
--
direct
file,
meaning
that
the
prosecutor
had
discretion
whether
to
bring
the
case
or
not.
he
brought
it
into
the
adult
system.
graham
accepted
being
processed
as
an
adult.
he
was
put
on
probation,
and
then--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--the
age
--
they
get
a
presentence
report.
the
age
is
woven
in--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
the
statute
doesn't
specifically
say
the
trial
judge--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--not
exactly,
because
the
range
of
remedies
the
trial
judge
can
impose
is
based
upon
what
method
by
which
the
juvenile
was
transferred
or
waived
into
the
adult
court.
in
graham's
case,
he
was
allowed
to
have
juvenile
and
youthful
offender
sanctions
considered
because
of
his
age.
i
mean,
that's
the
way--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
absolutely,
the
trial
judge
does.
and
you
can
see
the
trial
judge
here
grappling
with
that.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
i
guess
the
answer
to
your
question
is
there
is
no
specific
statute
that
says
the
trial
judge
shall
consider
age
specifically.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
no
--
i
mean,
certainly
not
under
any
federal
constitutional
principle
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
right,
right.
well,
certainly
here,
i
mean,
what
we
would
say,
assuming
there
is
no
categorical
rule
and
the
court
decides
to
go
into
the
proportionality
balance
here,
we
think
that
certainly
graham's
offense
certainly
is
off
the
scales
and
would
be
grossly
--
probably
be
--
it
would
be--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
the
prosecutor
recommended
30
years,
that's
correct,
and
the
judge
here
entered
life.
as
i
say,
that
translates
into
--
essentially
a
46-year
actuarial
life
sentence.
that
was
within
the
trial
judge's
discretion,
and
particularly
given
the
seriousness
of
the
offenses
that
graham
committed.
we
are
talking
about
violence.
and
violence
does
matter.
this
court
has
said
--
and
certainly
in
oral
argument
in
solem
and
others,
the
--
violence
versus
non-violent
acts
plays
a
major
role
in
sentencing,
and
it
should
play
a
major
role
as
well
when
it
comes
to
juveniles.
i
don't
read
roper
to
say
that
it
takes
off
the
table
lengthy
sentences
for
violent
crimes
by
juveniles.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
yes.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
it
certainly
raises
a
concern
about
the
age.
age
does
matter.
and
as
the
age
goes
down,
it
does.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
right.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
sure.
it
matters
--
i
think
it
does
matter
and
it
certainly
matters
from
a
legislative
perspective,
from
a
judicial
perspective,
and
from
an
eighth
amendment
perspective.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
certainly
that
historical
perspective
has--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--sure.
and
it
has
importance.
to
some
extent,
the
states
have
displaced
the
common
law
with
their
juvenile
justice
systems.
and
we
--
as
i
say,
i
believe
florida's
is
--
is
very
balanced.
going
back
to
your
question,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
the
way
age
plays
a
role
is
that
we
--
in
our
system
in
florida,
we
have
no
one
under
the
age
of
13.
and
that's
sort
of
provides
us--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i'm
sorry.
no
--
no
one
in
our
system
is
under
the
age
of
13
with
life
without
parole.
you
know,
there
are
very--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no,
the
legal
system
permits
it.
i--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--under
the
indictment
statute,
there
is
no
age
limitation.
so,
theoretically--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--that
is
theoretically.
we
would
hope
that
the
system
would
not
allow
that
to
occur.
and
that
that
would
be
certainly
violative
of
the--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
we
suggest
that
it
may
matter
in
a
particular
case,
and
when
you
get
to
the
gross
disproportionality--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
--
i
--
i
think
our
--
country's
traditions
recognize
it--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
believe
it
could
be
certainly
a
part
of
the
eighth
amendment
analysis.
i
think
just
--
certainly
age
matters
in
the
legislative
branch,
judicial
branch,
executive
branch.
it
matters
that
we
look
at
the
age
and
make
considerations
about
it
when
florida
has
made
those
considered
judgments.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
if
the
court
decides
to
go
down
the
path
that's
perhaps
fraught
with
more
line-drawing
than
one
can
imagine
and
decides
that
age
will
be
a
part
of
the
proportionality,
it
creates
serious
problems.
but
here--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well
--
well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
of
course--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
if
that's
applied,
and
even
if
you
consider
age
in
these
cases
that
are
before
the
court,
they
are
on
the
violent
side
of
the
line.
they
are
out
in
the
tail
of
the
distribution
in
terms
of
seriousness
of
the
offense.
so
it
would
be
the
same
result
in
either
case.
i
think
perhaps--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--there
is,
but
the
legislatures
make
the
judgment
about
how
they
are
going
to
punish
those.
and
in
florida,
we
have--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--because
it
is
still
a
very
serious,
violent
crime.
we
are
talking
about
weapons
and
guns
and
people's
lives
at
risk.
and
the
legislature
has
made
the
judgment
in
florida
and
other
states
to
say
that
that
type
of
crime--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
think
the
prosecutor
certainly
offered
up
to
30
years.
and
the
trial
judge
who,
as
you
can
tell
from
the
transcript,
was
familiar
that
there
were
these
home
invasions
going
on
around
our
county,
that
there
had
been
a
task
force
established,
and
so
forth,
the
--
the
trial
judge
was
aware
of
that
and
the
seriousness
of
it.
in
one
instance,
one
of
graham's
codefendants
actually
killed
someone
as
a
part
of
a
home
invasion.
these
were
serious
problems
afflicting
our
community
in
jacksonville.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
is
this
as
to
the
home
invasion
or
the
armed--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--the
home
invasion
--
there
was
an
11-year
sentence
for
the
codefendant.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
he
helped
--
helped
and
testified
and
basically
assisted
the
prosecution,
so
i
believe
he
got
a
lower
sentence.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
right.
the
third
one
is
in
jail,
life
without
parole
on
a
murder
charge,
life
without
parole
on
the
same
charge
graham
has
for
another
home
invasion,
and
then
has
the
other
serious
sentences.
so
he
--
for
his
home
invasions,
he
is
--
he
is
life
without
prison--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i
mean,
life
without
parole.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well
--
well,
graham
got
life
without
parole,
and
it
relates
back
to
his
armed
burglary
with
assault
and
battery.
he
got
the
life
sentence
under
that
charge,
which
is
then
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
violation-of-probation
hearing.
there
were
these
secondary
--
these
second
incidences
of
home
invasions
where
meigo
bailey
was
the
codefendant
who
got
life
for
murder
and
also
for
armed
burglary
as
a
part
of
one
of
the
home
invasions.
so
they
--
you
know,
they
got
serious
punishment.
this
is
a
serious
punishment
that
was
meted
out
to
them.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
justice
ginsburg,
we
respect
that,
and
certainly
in
roper
that
was
the
linchpin
to
the
decision.
here
we
are
in
a
different
context
that
deals
with
these
--
these
terms
of
years,
and
there
--
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
parole.
and
certainly
that
is
a
purely
legislative
decision
to
be
made,
and
states
have
said
we
are
not
going
to
have
parole.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
true.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
and
it
--
and
it
goes
to
the
core
of
the
state's
sovereignty
to
decide
what
laws
to
enact.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
and,
justice
ginsburg,
we
ask
that
the
same
respect
for
our
juvenile
justice
system
be
given
to
those
laws
enacted
in
florida
that
protect
the
--
the
juveniles.
it
is
the
legislature
on
the
ground
there
and
seeing
what's
going
on
in
our
state
that
makes
these
decisions
about
who
can
drive,
who
gets
the
right
to
have
a
tattoo,
or
who
gets--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--that's
true
but
at
the
same
--
by
the
same
token,
the
juvenile
justice
system
in
florida
--
and
keep
in
mind
we
had
a
juvenile
justice
division
--
department
established
in
1994
because
of
the
severe
problems
as
we
outlined
in
our
brief
--
that
florida
has
a
--
has
committed
resources
and
--
and
programs
and
so
forth
to
the
juvenile
justice
system.
so
given
all
of
that,
that
what
the
court
--
i
am
sorry
--
what
the
state
has
done
as
--
as
to
age,
that's
why
we
say
that
it
matters.
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
that
to
pursue
the
categorical
rule
that
they
seek,
the
court
would
have
to,
of
course,
abandon
the
various
firewalls
that
would
stand
between
terms
of
years
and
also
the
death
penalty.
but,
in
addition,
if
the
court
decides
to
go
down
the
proportionality
route,
my
concern
is
the
five
principles
in
the
harmelin
concurrence
about
the
states
having
the
ability
to
have
diverse
juvenile
justice
programs
and
not
have
the
--
sort
of
a
lawnmower
coming
through
and
making
them
all
uniform.
the
harmelin
concurrence,
justice
kennedy,
talked
about
the
deference
in
structuring
these.
and
there's
going
to
be
differences.
some
states
are
going
to
have
the
most
harsh
laws.
the
eighth
amendment
doesn't
dictate
any
particular
penological
theory.
there's
great
--
and
it
--
it
would
turn
the
eighth
amendment
analysis
on
its
head
to
first
allow
this
diversity
among
the
states
and
allow
strong
medicine
for
certain
types
of
violent
crimes
and
then
to
kind
of
compare
them
and
say,
well,
gosh,
florida
is
unusual;
it's
different;
and
that
shouldn't
be
the
case
whatsoever.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
think
certainly
the
state
of
florida's
interest
as
among
other
states
is
first
of
all
to
punish.
certainly
i
think
deterrence
plays
a
role.
we
recognize
that
deterrence
may
have
less
impact
on
some
juveniles,
but
it
doesn't
have
--
it
doesn't
have
zero
impact.
it
does
have
some
impact--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
but
the
deterrence
goes
to
those
who
would
commit
the
same
act.
rather
than
deterring
this
particular
individual,
it
goes
to
others
who--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i
don't
--
i
have
not
seen
empiricism
on
this
at
all
to
say,
you
know,
what
--
does
it
really
matter
or
not.
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
on
the
street
people
do
talk
about
these
things.
i
mean,
would
they--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i
--
i
have
seen
none,
and
it
--
it
goes
to
the
question
here,
which
is
that
graham
will
be
serving
a
lengthy
prison
term.
and
what
he
is
seeking
is
essentially
the
right
to
get
out
at
some
point
in
the
future
and
even
saying
that
40
years
would
be--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i
--
i
don't
have
that
at
my
grasp,
but--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
in
terms
of
recidivism,
i
think,
number
one,
violence
matters.
i
think
there
are
studies
--
i
can't
quite
put
my
finger
on
--
that
says
that
the
violent
offenders
tend
to
recidivate
more
than
the
non-violent.
and
that
as
one
ages
--
i
think
judge
posner
has
written
a
book
called
"aging
and
old
age"
that
talks
about
--
in
one
of
its
chapters
about
how
age
matters,
and
that
crime
rates
go
down
as
--
as
the
population
ages.
so
i
mean
there
are
those
sorts
of
things
out
there
that--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--there
are
--
there
are
studies
everywhere,
and
i
have
looked
at
many
of
them,
and
it
appears
that
it
certainly
increases
from
age
13,
and
it
goes
up
to
14.
and
it
keeps
going
up
until
about
16,
17,
and
18.
it
peaks.
it
depends
on
the
crime,
and
it
depends
upon
what
jurisdiction,
and
so
forth.
but
it
tends
to
peak
in
the
early
20s,
the
late
teens
or
early
20s.
so
that's
--
that's
--
i
think
that's
typical.
one
thing
i
would
point
out
that
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
say:
the
empirical
question
in
this
case,
i
think,
is
very
important
because
they
are
asking
that
a
constitutional
rule
be
established
on
studies
that
have
just
been
generated
literally
over
this
summer
and
have
not
been
subject
to
meaningful
review.
we
have
a
concern
with
that.
we
think
that
the
definitional
questions
that
they
have
raised,
you
know,
about
the
offenses
and
what
is
life
--
is
life
--
the
studies
tend
to
focus
on
life.
but
what
is
life?
well,
in
florida
we
have
some
juveniles
who
are
serving
prison
terms
that
have
50-,
60-,
70-,
80-year
sentences,
but
they
are
not
included
within
that
study.
we
also
have
in
this
case,
for
example,
graham,
he
had
a
--
let's
say
that
the
judge
decided
to
give
him
30
years
for
the
main
offense
and
15
for
the
second
and
made
them
consecutive.
that's
45
years.
graham's
actuarial
life--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
they've
conceded,
in
their
brief,
that
what
this
all
boils
down
to
is
that
if
graham
wins
and
he
gets
to
go
back
and
be
resentenced,
that
either
the
florida
legislature
has
to
pass
a
law
to
reinstitute
parole
for
this
category
of
offenders,
or
the
trial
judge
could
say,
okay,
the
actuarial
table
says
you
are
going
to
live
to
be
64.2,
we're
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
to
something
less--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--there
is
still
a
parole
board.
its
functions
have
been
minimized
greatly.
it
has
not
been
applicable
to
anyone
since
1983.
it
would
take
a
legislative
act
or
perhaps
even
an
executive
act
of
some
sort
to
reinstitute
that
board
and
to
take
account
of
these
cases.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
no,
no.
they
are
in
existence.
i
cannot
specifically
answer
that,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
don't
know
all
the
different
programs
that
are
available.
there's
the
various
programs
that
deal
with
drug
offenses
and
alcoholism
and
so
forth.
and
there
--
there
are
certain
educational
programs.
for
example,
when
graham
was
in
the
county
jail
--
that
was
the
county
versus
the
state
--
he
was
able
to
go
to
school.
i
don't
believe
there
is
anywhere
near
sort
of
the
total
absence
and
deprivation,
sort
of
a
weems
case,
sort
of
we
put
you
in
a
cell
and
you
rot
there
for
the
rest
of
your
life,
at
all
in
our
system.
there's
all
these
various
rights
that
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
are
--
enable
--
they
are
able
to
have
familial
relationships.
they
can
have
the
maslow's
hierarchy.
i
mean,
they
--
physiological
needs
and
emotional
needs
and
so
forth
are
still
available
to
be
met
in
prison.
so
i
can't
give
you
specific
programs,
justice
kennedy,
but
in
florida's
system,
they
do
exist.
if
there's
no
further
questions--
