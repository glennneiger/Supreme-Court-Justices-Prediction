mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
sentencing
an
adolescent
to
life
without
any
possibility
of
parole
condemns
him
to
die
in
prison
and
rejects
any
hope
that
he
will
change
for
the
better.
this
sentence,
like
the
death
penalty,
cruelly
ignores
the
inherent
qualities
of
youth
and
the
differences
between
adolescents
and
adults.
at--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--we
are
--
we
are
drawing
the
line,
your
honor,
at
--
at
non-homicide
cases
because
we
recognize
under
the
eighth
amendment
that
we
must
look
at
societal
consensus,
and
society
has
said
that
murder
is
different
and
has
said
that
in
the
sentencing
practices,
as
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
outside
of
florida
judges
and
juries
have
imposed
this
sentence
on
just
30
non-homicide
offenders
in
just
6
states.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
thirty--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--the
vast
majority
allow
it
and
they
have
for
some
time,
and
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
it
has
been
allowed
for
so
long
and
imposed
so
rarely,
as
the
states
themselves
have
admitted,
is
--
is
strong
evidence
of
societal
consensus.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
your
honor,
i
would
--
i
would
disagree.
i
would
--
if
--
if
there's
30
--
31
states
that
have
allowed
it
and
have
never
imposed
it,
in
--
in
our
judgment,
that
--
that's
evidence
that
it's
very
unusual,
and
you
couple
that--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--no,
your
honor,
it
has
to--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
our
position
is
that
you
are
looking
at
two
things.
one,
is
it
cruel?
it's
cruel
because
life
without
parole
is
unique,
is
particularly
cruel
to
adolescents
because
it
--
it
gives
up
on
the
adolescent
and
determines
that
he
is
forever
unfit
to
live
in
civil
society.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
we
draw
the
line
at
18,
the
same
line
that
the
court
drew
in
roper.
and
it's
cruel
because
of
the
inherent
--
the
inherent
qualities
of
youth.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
your
honor,
that's
--
that's
correct.
the
life
--
yes.
a
life
with
parole
sentence
would
be
constitutional,
and
that
may
mean
that
person
you
describe
still
spends
his
entire
life
in
prison,
but
life
with
parole
gives
some
hope
to
the
adolescent
who
has
an
inherent
capacity
to
change.
it
gives
him
some
hope
that
later
in
time
he
may
be
released.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
it
should
be
left
up
to
the
states
to
decide.
we
think
that
the
--
the
colorado
provision
would
probably
be
constitutional.
we
will
have
to
see
what
different
states
do.
i
mean,
but
--
but,
yes,
even
that
long
amount
of
time
would
give
at
least
some
hope
to
the
adolescent
offender.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
i
think
all
that
would
have
to
be
required,
your
honor
--
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient.
all
that
would
have
to
be
required
is
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
the
adolescent
offender
to
demonstrate
that
he
has
in
fact
changed,
reformed,
and
is
now
fit
to
live
in
society.
it
--
that's
all.
that's
all
we
are
asking
for.
we
are
not
asking
that
it
be
automatic
right
to
get
back
out.
if
terrance
graham
or
joe
sullivan--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--your
honor,
first,
i'm
--
i'm
not
conceding
that
with
50.
the
question
was
asked
about
40.
but
i
understand--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
this
sentence
that
we
are
here
today
before
is
unequivocally,
unmistakably
a
condemnation
that
you
will
never
be
released
from
prison,
and
so
this
sentence
clearly
falls
on
the
line
of
being
cruel
because
it
tells
an
adolescent,
for
an
adolescent
mistake,
you
can
never
live
in
civil
society.
there
will
be
other
sentences
that
people
will
argue
are
the
equivalent
of
this
sentence,
and
--
and
people
may
argue
that
with
a
50-year
sentence.
but
this
sentence
here
is
unequivocal,
and
there
is
no
question
that
it's
cruel
because
of
--
of
the
fact
that
it
rejects
any
hope
that
the
adolescent
can
be
changed.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
with
leave,
i
will
let
mr.
stevenson
answer
about
the
procedural
bar.
but
on
the
first
question,
your
honor,
i
would
point
you
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
various
correctional
officers
that
talk
about
the
types
of
programs
that
can
be
done.
i
think
that
that
has
--
is
very
thorough
and
--
and
would
answer
it
far
better
than
i
can
in
a
couple
minutes
up
here.
but,
yes,
to
answer
short,
we
--
we
believe
that
--
that
the
parole
systems
in
place
can
be
effective
to
do
this,
and
in
all
seven
states
where
there
are
currently
non-homicide
juvenile
offenders,
they
all
have
functioning
parole
systems.
even
florida
has
it.
even
though
it
--
it
abolished
parole
in
1983,
florida
still
has
6,000
parole-eligible
inmates
and
last
year
they
heard
over
--
they
made
over
1,700
parole
determinations.
so
the
--
the
administrative
burden
to
the
state
of
adding
these--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--going
forward,
it
has
abolished
parole--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--and
florida
could
choose
to
make
that
sentence
and
instead
impose
a
sentence,
as
its
prosecutor
recommended
here,
a
30-year
determinant
sentence,
if
florida
doesn't
want
to
reinstitute
parole.
we
are
not
saying
it
has
to
do
parole.
that's
just
one
of
several
constitutional
options.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
well,
your
--
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
that
you
would
get
into
the
question
about
whether
that
sentence
is
the
equivalent
of
life
without
parole,
and
there
could
be
an
argument
made
that
if
you
--
obviously,
if
you
sentence
someone
to
150,
200
years,
there's
no
conceivable
hope
of
ever
release,
150
years
without
parole.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
i
would
think
that
the
--
if
you
had
that
--
i
would
think
that
the
--
that
the
judge
making
that
sentence
would
have
to
take
that
into
consideration,
that
this
sentence
is
going
to
--
based
on
all
adolescent
conduct
--
it
has
to
be
all
adolescent
conduct,
not
if
some
of
the
conduct
is
post-juvenile.
but,
yes,
i
would
think
that
the
--
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
would
need
to
take
that
into
consideration.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
would
be
okay,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--i
think--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--i
think
there
has
to
be
some--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--your
--
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
coming
so
close
to
the
--
the
constitutional
line,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
that
as
constitutional,
but
--
but--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--your
honor,
i'm--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--your
--
your
honor,
there
would
definitely
be
a
--
a
difficult
line
to
draw
at
that
case.
life
without
parole,
though,
is
unequivocal.
and
even
that
sentence
that
you
are
describing,
there
is
some
difference
between
it
and
life
without
parole,
because
only
life
without
parole
makes
the
unequivocal
assessment
that
the
adolescent
cannot
be
returned
to
civil
society.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
yes.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
well,
two
things:
first,
your
honor,
roper
states,
and
the
science
--
states
it
based
on
the
science,
that
at
that
age
we
cannot
make
a
determination
about
whether
or
not
the
adolescent
will
or
will
not
reform.
even
an
expert
psychologist,
psychiatrist
cannot
do
it.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
well,
anywhere
you
draw
the
line,
your
honor,
you're
going
to
come
up
with
an
example
where
you
are
1
day
before
or
1
day
after,
and
the
court
in
roper
struggled
with
where
to
draw
the
line
between
maturity
and
immaturity,
and
it
concluded,
rightly
so,
to
draw
the
line
at
18
based
on
both
the
science
and
the
legislative
determinations.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
i
think
it's
because
adolescents
are
different.
adolescents
are
different
in
that
we
can't
tell
at
this
age
whether
they
are
going
to
reform
or
not.
and
all
we
are
proposing
is
that
an
adolescent
not
necessarily
be
released,
but
that
he
be
given
a
later
opportunity.
and
it
boils
--
it
just
comes
down
to
adolescents
are
different,
your
honor,
and
the
determination
can't
be
made
at
age
17
even
for
the
most
heinous
crimes
that
are
committed.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
if
i
understand
your
question,
would
it
be
different
if
those
type
of
programs
are
made
available
to
life-without--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--yes.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
yes,
that
is
generally
true.
and
the
--
and
the
very
website
that
the
state
of
florida
cites
makes
a
point
of
saying
that
the
programs
are
for
the
purpose
of
reentry
into
society,
and
so
those
are
obviously
the
opposite
of
what
life
without
parole
is.
you
are
never
going
to
reenter
society.
and
it's
generally
true
that
those
programs
are
not
available
to
offenders
who
get
life
without
parole,
and
that's
what
makes
the
sentence
so
particularly
cruel,
to
give
up
on
a
kid
at
that
point
in
his
life.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
varies
obviously
by
facility
by
facility.
but
the
sentence
means
you
are
going
to
stay
in
your
cell
and
die
there.
you
are
going
to
stay
in
your
cell
for
60
or
70
years,
whenever
you
reach
your
natural
death,
and
die
there.
you
know,
they
--
they
do
have
some
limited
freedoms,
as
the
state
of
florida
has
pointed
out,
the
same
types
of
freedoms
that
people
on
death
row
have.
but
ultimately
both
sentences
mean
that
you
are
going
to
die
in
a
state-controlled
institution.
and
they
are
very
hopeless--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--well,
the
state
makes
the
point
in
their
brief,
your
honor,
that
you
have
the
right
to
exercise
your
religion,
you
have
the
--
you
have
the
right
to
petition
the
courts.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
your
honor,
i
--
obviously
everything
varies
facility
by
facility,
but
it's--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
you
are
correct.
i'm
not
suggesting
they
are
in
solitary
confinement.
but
they
are
locked
up
for
the
rest
of
their
life,
and
they're
not
allowed
to
rejoin
civil
society
even
if,
as
some
of
the
former
juvenile
offenders
who
filed
a
brief
in
this
case,
can
demonstrate
that
they
have
become
model
citizens.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
particular
case.
no.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
familiar
with
that
case.
your
honor,
the
reason,
first
of
all,
the
court
has
said
and
said
so
clearly
in
kennedy
that
murder
is
different.
in
the
kennedy
decision,
you
also
said:
horrible
facts,
someone
who
raped
their
stepdaughter.
but
yet
this
court
drew
a
line
and
exempted
from
capital
punishment
adult
defendants
who
commit
horrible
crimes.
but
to
get
to
the
core
of
your
question
as
to
why
not
do
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
because
you
can
only
make
the
determination
about
the
adolescent
later
in
life.
and
i
--
we
would
agree
that
there
should
be
a
case-by-case
determination
as
to
--
as
to
whether
or
not
that
offender
should
spend
his
whole
life
in
prison,
but
we
say
it
needs
to
happen
later,
once
he
has
matured,
once
he's
reached
past
adulthood,
because
when
you're--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--we
are
not
suggesting
that
it
goes
to
the
point
of
zero.
we're
not
--
and
we
concede
the
state
has
a
right
to
--
to
exact
retribution
from
the
juvenile
offender.
and
in
this
case,
30
years
would
have
been
a
lot
of
retribution
for
terrance
graham,
both--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--well,
your
honor,
we
--
but
a
juvenile
is
--
not
only
does
he
have
an
inherent
capacity
to
grow;
he
is
less
culpable.
and
so
to
exact
the
most
--
for
a
non-homicide
crime
whether
you
are
adult
or
juvenile,
this
is
the
most
severe
punishment
you
can
receive,
and
to
exact
that
most
severe
punishment
for
a
less
culpable
offender
that
the
court
has
recognized
is
a
less
culpable
offender
doesn't
--
is
too
much
retribution.
we
are
not
saying
the
state
can't
exercise
retribution,
but
that
life
without
parole
is
--
is
too
much
for
those
types
of
crimes.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
yes,
justice.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
he
would
have
had
to
have
been
released
when
he
was
22
years.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
no,
no,
your
honor.
we
--
we
concede
that
the
state
of
florida
may
continue
to
prosecute
juveniles
in
adult
court
and
that
makes
sense
in
order
to
get
a
term
of
years
that
is
longer
than
you
can
get
in
juvenile
court.
and
in
this
case,
if
the
judge
had
gone
along
with
the
prosecutor's
recommendation,
it
would
have
meant
a
30-year
sentence
for
my
client,
which
would
have
been
far
longer
than
he
could
have
gotten
in
the
juvenile
court.
worse--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--well,
i
guess
we
will
come
back
to
the
point
that
i
think
life
with
parole
would
be
a
long
sentence,
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
at
age
17.
you
can
certainly
do
it--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--there
is
no
--
no.
under
florida
law,
there
is
no
basis
to
challenge
a
sentence
as
being
excessive
or
disproportionate
as
long
as
it's
at
the
statutory
maximum.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
right.
i
guess
i
understood
justice
ginsburg's
question
as
if
under
florida
law.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
can
you--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--right.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
i
guess
a
--
i
know
under
federal
--
under
federal
sentencing
law,
statutory
law,
there's
a
reasonableness
review.
and
i
was
--
i
guess
i
was
trying
to
draw
a
comparison
with,
and
maybe
i'm
not
answering
the
question
correctly,
that
we
don't
have
that
in
florida.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
well,
there
would
--
it
would
have
to
be
strictly
federal
law.
it
would
have
to
be
a
procedure
on
a
--
if
you
do
this
case-by-case
suggestion,
it
would
--
it
would
have
to
be
strictly
based
on
federal
constitutional
law,
because--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--you
can--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--you
--
you
could
make
that
argument.
and
we
do
--
we
do
--
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
do
have
a
fallback
position
in
our
papers
based
on
mr.
graham's
offense
of
armed
burglary
and
--
and
the
fact
that
in
only
two
states
could
mr.
graham
have
gotten
this
sentence
and
that
the
only
state
that
has
actually
imposed
it
for
a
first-time
armed
burglary
is
florida.
and
it--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--he
--
he
admitted
to
the
police,
and
i
don't
want
to
get
too
much
into
the
facts,
but
that
--
but
even
if
your
honor
concedes
that
he
was
convicted
of
all
those
crimes,
which
he
was
not
convicted
of,
but
the
judge,
as
you
say,
correctly
relied
upon
for
this
sentence,
then
we
only
have
two
states
that
we
know
of
that
have
imposed
life
without
parole
for
a
recidivist
robbery
or
burglary
crime,
and
that's
california
and
florida.
and
we
--
we've
set
forth
that
argument
to
give
the
court
that
option,
but
we
believe
our
primary
argument,
the
categorical
rule,
is
more
logical
because
of
the
fact
that
you
can't
do
a
case-by-case
determination
of
an
adolescent
at
the
time
--
based
on
his
juvenile
offense.
and
maybe,
in
these
horrible
crimes--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--well,
you--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--there
is
not
much
difference,
your
honor,
but
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
and
society,
as
this
court
recognized
in
roper,
has
generally
drawn
that
line
at
18--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--as
between
the--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--you
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
based
on
--
i
would
just
ask
to
conclude
and
then
i
will
sit
down.
based
on
the
--
on
what
scientists
have
told
us,
the
categorical
approach
is
the
most
logical
approach
because
we
can't
tell
which
adolescents
are
going
to
change
and
which
aren't.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
i'm
sorry.
the
three
trends
are:
the
strong
punishment
for
juveniles
that
states
have
enacted
over
the
last
15
--
20
years;
the
various
transfer
and
waiver
laws
that
states
have
enacted
over
the
last
10,
15,
20
years
allowing
juveniles
to
be
transferred
into
adult
court;
and
then
finally,
what
is
really
at
issue
is
parole.
parole
has
been
eliminated
in
many
states.
fifteen
states
have
totally
eliminated
it
in
the
last
10,
15
years.
so
what
they
are
seeking
is
a
categorical
rule
that
goes
against
the
national
consensus
and
the
national
trend.
the
concession
here
was
that
graham's
sentence
could
be
even
up
to
life
as
long
as
there
is
the
possibility
of
parole.
we
believe
that's
very
telling.
in
their
brief,
they
point
out
that
graham
could
have
been
sentenced
to
something
just
short
of
his
actuarial
life.
his
actuarial
life
is
around
64
years
old,
which
means
just
about
a
46-year
sentence.
and
the
standard
that
we
suggest
here
is
that
there
cannot
be
any
categorical
rule,
for
the
reasons
justice
alito
pointed
out.
we
have--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
because
the
juvenile
is
different
than
an
adult.
a
juvenile
is
less
culpable.
he's
--
we
know
over
time
he
will
change
and
--
and
potentially
reform,
as
opposed
to
an
adult.
once
you
are
fully
formed,
you
are
more
culpable
and
you
don't
have
that
same
inherent
capacity
to
change.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
no,
your
honor,
and
nobody
was
willing
to
say
that
in
roper,
but,
yet,
the
court
still
drew
the
line
at
18
for
the
death
penalty
in
roper.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
we
are
not
--
we
were
not--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--well,
i
--
first,
we
--
we
are
not
asking
that
the
procedural
rules
in
the
intricate
individualized
death
penalty
sentencing
scheme
be
transported
or
moved
over
to
the
noncapital
cases.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
because
those
rules
make
no
sense
when
you
are
talking
about
adolescents,
who
are
different,
because
those
--
which
a
court
recognized
in
roper,
that
those
rules
can't
be
applied
to
adolescents
because
we
--
you
can't,
as
a
sentencer,
predict
the
future.
and
so,
though
death
is
different,
it's
not
different
in
any
critical
respects
here
because
the
punishment,
life
without
parole,
just
like
death,
says
that
the
offender
is
forever
irredeemable,
is
forever
unfit
to
live
in
society,
and
must
die
in
prison.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
your
--
your
honor,
i
think
the
only
difference
here
is
--
between
life
without
parole
and
life
with
parole,
is
that
there
will
be
a
determination
later,
at
age
30
or
40
or
sometime
thereafter,
as
to
whether
that
is
the
right
sentence.
and
the
--
the
parole
official,
just
like
the
judge,
can
consider
the
offense
as
the
offender,
as
a
juvenile.
we're
just
saying
that
you
can't
make
that
complete
determination
at
such
a
young
age,
and--
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
--and
you
will
have
a
more
accurate
determination
later.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
your
honor,
as
my
brother
noted,
i
think
that
the
evidence
shows
that,
as
people
get
older,
they
are
less
likely
to
recommit
crimes.
mr.
bryan
s.
gowdy
it
--
it
decreases
over
time,
undoubtedly,
and
that's
--
that
supports,
i
think,
our
argument
here,
that
the
--
that
terrance
graham,
at
age
47,
will
not
be
the
person
he
was
at
age
17.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i'll
sit
down.
