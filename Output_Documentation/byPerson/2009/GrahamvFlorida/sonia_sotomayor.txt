justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
haven't
answered
justice
alito's
point,
which
is:
what's
the
difference
a
month
before
he's
18
and
a
month
after?
what
makes
us
more
capable
at
the
18th
birthday
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
affirm
a
judgment
that
someone
can't
be
--
can't
be
--
can't
be
rehabilitated?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--do
you
think
that
it
categorically
violates
the
eighth
amendment
for
a
10-year-old
to
be
sentenced
to
life
without
parole?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
once
it
matters,
the
question
for
me
is
--
help
me
draw
the
line
--
if
10
is
in
my
judgment
too
early,
why
isn't
14,
16,
or
18?
meaning
why
should
a
--
someone
below
the
age
of
14
be
sentenced
to
life
without
parole?
that's
the
--
that's
the
sullivan
case--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
it
begs
the
question,
which
is
age
is
--
matters
a
lot.
and
so,
take
on
your
adversary's
argument
that
it
matters
a
lot
because
this
is
a
less
culpable
person.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
because
judges
haven't
chosen
to
impose
it
or
because
your
legal
system
doesn't
permit
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
young
could
the
youngest
person
in
florida
be
to
be
prosecuted
as
an
adult
and
be
eligible
for
life--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--without
parole?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
a
5-year-old
could
be
put
away
for
life?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
not
seriously
suggesting
that
the
crimes
at
issue
here
are
comparable
to
a
rape
or
a
permanent
infliction
of
serious
disability
or
any
of
those
other
very
violent
crimes
that
are
close
to
homicide
that
justice
alito
spoke
about?
there
is
a
quantitative
and
qualitative
difference
between
those,
isn't
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
if
we
--
if
we
have
already
said
that
you
can't
impose
death
on
an
adult
who
hasn't
committed
a
homicide,
an
intentional
death,
and
so
for
an
adult
the
most
serious
sentence
that
we
can
give
them
is
life
without
parole,
why
should
that
same
sentence
be
given
to
a
juvenile
who
we
have
recognized
as
being
less
capable
than
an
adult?
and
why
should
we
permit
it
for
a
crime
that's
not
comparable
to
a
homicide
and/or
something
akin
in
seriousness
to
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
it
true
--
and
i
think
one
of
my
colleagues
already
questioned
you
--
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
think
that
this
merited
life
without
parole.
didn't
the
parole
supervisor
say
that
this
young
man,
mr.
graham,
was
compliant
with
other
conditions
of
his
probation?
he
went
to
school.
he
did
other
things.
it
does
suggest
some
hope
for
him.
