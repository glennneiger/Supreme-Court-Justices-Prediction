justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
making
a--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
you
are
making
a
per
se
argument,
no?
you
can
imagine
someone
who
is
a
month
short
of
his
18th
birthday,
and
you
are
saying
that,
no
matter
what
this
person
does,
commits
the
most
horrible
series
of
non-homicide
offenses
that
you
can
imagine,
a
whole
series
of
brutal
rapes,
assaults
that
render
the
--
the
victim
paraplegic
but
not
dead,
no
matter
what,
the
person
is
sentenced
shows
no
remorse
whatsoever,
the
worst
case
you
can
possibly
imagine,
cannot
--
that
person
must
at
some
point
be
made
eligible
for
parole.
that's
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
agree
with
you--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
we
agree
with
you,
at
what
point
must
the
parole
consideration
be
given?
there
is
a
suggestion
in
your
brief
that
maybe
the
colorado
statute,
which
says
that
a
person
can
get
parole
consideration
after
40
years,
would
be
constitutional.
is
that
your
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
florida
has
abolished
parole,
has
it
not,
going
forward?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
eventually,
if
things
are
allowed
to
take
their
course,
the
florida
parole
board
will
go
out
of
business.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
why
isn't
the
--
the
most
sensible
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
you
are
raising,
the
one
that
the
chief
justice
suggested,
to
permit
as-applied
proportionality
challenges
that
take
into
account
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
juvenile
in
question,
rather
than
this
per
se
rule
that
you
are
advocating,
which
would
deprive
the
state
of
florida
from
reaching
the
judgment
that
there
are
some
--
there
are
some
juveniles,
some
individuals
who
are
short
of
their
18th
birthday,
who
cannot
--
who
deserve
imprisonment
in
--
life
imprisonment
without
parole?
some
of
the
actual
cases
that
--
in
which
this
sentence
has
been
imposed
in
florida
involve
factual
situations
that
are
so
horrible
that
i
couldn't
have
imagined
them
if
i
hadn't
actually
seen
them.
raping
an
8-year-old
girl
and
burying
her
alive.
are
you
familiar
with
that
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
raping
a
woman
in
front
of
her
12-year-old
son
and
then
forcing
the
son
to
engage
in
sexual
conduct
with
the
mother.
are
you
familiar
with
that
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
know
anybody
who
is
willing
to
say
that,
as
a
categorical
matter,
that
--
you
know,
the
18th
birthday
is
the
magical
date
for
every
single
person?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
because
the
court,
up
to
this
point,
has
said
that
death
is
different,
and
the
rules
--
the
eighth
amendment
rules
in
capital
cases
are
entirely
different
from
the
eighth
amendment
rules
in
--
in
all
other
cases.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
--
you
know,
if
we
abandon
that,
then
one
of
two
things
has
to
happen,
either
the
rules
for
noncapital
cases
have
to
change
dramatically,
or
the
rules
for
capital
cases
have
to
change
dramatically,
unless
death
is
different,
in
fact.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
know
you
are
not
asking
for
that,
but
that
--
isn't
that
where
this,
logically,
is
going?
if
death
is
not
different,
then
there
should
be
uniform
rules
across
the
board.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
does
it
say
that?
why
doesn't
it
just
say
that,
in
this
particular
case,
what
this
individual
has
done
is
so
bad
that,
even
if
this
person
can
be
rehabilitated
and
would
not
present
a
danger
to
--
to
society
at
age
60
or
70,
that
this
person
is
--
should
be
sentenced
to
life
without
parole?
that's
--
that's
what
it
means
for
an
adult
offender.
