chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-7412,
graham
v.
florida.
mr.
gowdy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thirty-eight
states
allow
this
sentence,
though,
don't
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thirty-eight,
39.
i
know
you
have
a
little
dispute,
but
the
vast
majority
of
states
allow
the
imposition
of
this
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
would
be
strong
evidence
that
they
appreciate
the
gravity
of
the
sentence
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
juveniles
and
therefore
only
impose
it
rarely.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
--
what
if
it's
the
--
pursuant
to
the
usual
state
parole
system,
and
it
turns
out
that
grants
parole
to
1
out
of
20
applicants?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
--
your
argument
suggests
that
you
are,
quite
rightly,
focusing
on
the
particular
facts
that
have
life
without
parole.
but
if
you
concede
that
it's
all
right
to
have
a
sentence
of
50
years
and
then
a
consideration
where
1
out
of
20
people
are
granted
parole,
i
think
it
suggests
that
the
line
you
would
draw
is
--
is
pretty
artificial
--
or
certainly
suggests
that
the
next
case
we
will
get
is
somebody
with
life
with
parole
after
50
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
saying
there
is
something
in
the
eighth
amendment
that
draws
a
distinction
between
40
and
50
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
--
you
are
arguing
for
a
categorical
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
on
the
other
side
is
arguing
for
a
categorical
rule,
always
permissible.
but
we
have
a
precedent
that
suggests
in
--
in
an
individual
case,
you
assess
the
proportionality
of
the
sentence
to
the
crime.
now,
we
know
from
roper
that
death
is
different,
and
we
know
from
roper
that
juveniles
are
different.
wouldn't
it
make
sense
to
incorporate
the
consideration
of
the
juvenile
status
into
the
proportionality
review?
so
that
if
you
do
have
a
case
where
it's
the
17-year-old
who
is
1
week
shy
of
his
18th
birthday
and
it
is
the
most
grievous
crime
spree
you
can
imagine,
you
can
determine
that
in
that
case
life
without
parole
may
not
be
disproportionate.
but
if
it's
--
and
i
know
you
would
argue
that
these
are
the
facts
here
--
if
it's
a
less
grievous
crime
and
there
is,
for
example,
a
younger
defendant
involved,
then
in
that
case
maybe
it
is
disproportionate.
why
--
why
doesn't
that
seem
more
sensitive?
and
it
avoids
all
of
the
line-drawing
problems
we
have
been
discussing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
understand.
but
i
don't
think
they'll
say
that
we
can't
make
that
determination
at
17
years
51
months,
but
we
can
make
that
determination
at
18
years
1
month.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
is
because,
as
they
told
us,
death
is
different.
and
you
do
--
once
you
decide
that,
you
do
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere.
i'm
just
wondering
why
we
have
to
go
all
the
way
in
with
you
or
all
the
way
with
your
opponent
when
our
precedent
allows
us
to
consider
an
issue
of
this
sort
on
a
caseby
--
case
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
logic
in
roper
was
very
straightforward.
it
says,
"death
is
reserved
for
the
worst
of
the
worst.
"
i
think
that
was
the
quote.
we
know
that
juveniles
are
not
the
worst
of
the
worst,
for
the
reasons
you
have
articulated,
that
they
are
not
fully
developed,
don't
have
moral
sense
to
the
same
extent
as
an
adult.
but
life
without
parole
is
not
reserved
for
the
worst
of
the
worst,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
logic
of
our
precedent
suggests
that
you
can't
necessarily
rely
on
the
juvenile
status
to
exempt
them
from
a
penalty
that
is
not
reserved
for
the
worst
of
the
worst,
but
perhaps
it
makes
sense
to
consider
in
a
particular
instance
whether
the
penalty
is
disproportionate,
given
the
juvenile's
characteristics
that
you
suggest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
wasn't
prior
to
our
death
penalty
jurisprudence,
either.
and
i
thought
we
reviewed
proportionality
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
the
solem
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
did
i,
but
we
are
talking
about
constitutionality
under
the
eighth
amendment--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--which
is
federal
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gowdy.
mr.
makar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
are
arguing
for
a
categorical
rule
of
your
own.
you
are
saying
that
under
a
--
under
--
juveniles
under
the
age
of
18,
what,
it's
never
--
it
can
be
never
determinative
that
they
are
juvenile
in
setting
the
sentence
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then
the
--
what
is
your
objection
to
an
approach
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
life
without
parole,
for
the
reasons
that
your
brother
has
articulated,
you
must
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
consider
the
juvenile
status
of
the
defendant
before
that
sentence
is
imposed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
not
a
--
not
a
categorical
rule
that
it
automatically
makes
a
difference,
but
not
a
categorical
rule
that
it
can
never
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
--
and
there's
--
well,
i
guess
that
answers
my
question.
he
is
not
required
to
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
he
can
say:
i
am
not
considering
the
fact
that
this
is
a
juvenile
because
i
think
his
crime
should
be
treated
as
an
adult
crime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
what
we
are
arguing
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
--
in
your
earlier
response
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
you
said
age
certainly
matters.
as
--
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
what
law?
in
other
words,
i
understood
your
submission
to
be
that
there
was
nothing
in
federal
law
that
requires
different
consideration
of
age.
so
when
you
say
age
matters,
why?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
the
authority
of
what
law?
age
matters
in
a
particular
case
because
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
of
the
eighth
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
why
is
that?
if
you
go
down
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
there
are
no
line-drawing
problems.
you
just
simply
say
age
has
to
be
considered
as
a
matter
of
the
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
apply
the
proportionality
review
that
we
articulated
in
harmelin,
and
solem
and
ewing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
already
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
along
those
lines
--
and,
again,
maybe
this
was
in
the
amicus
briefs.
do
you
have
a
study
about
what
age
cohort
is
responsible
for
most
violent
crime?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
makar.
mr.
gowdy,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
reason
states--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--one
reason
states
and
the
federal
government
moved
to
abolish
parole
in
--
in
recent
decades
was,
with
depressing
regularity,
prisoners
released
on
parole
committed
crimes
again.
and
i'm
just
--
is
there
any
empirical
evidence
that
tells
us
how
often
people,
say,
from
17
--
17-year-olds,
when
released,
commit
crimes
again,
as
opposed
to
18
to
20-year-olds?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
isn't
that
--
i
remember
some
of
those
studies
that
--
i
mean,
the
cutoff,
there's
sort
of
a
magic
age
at
some
point,
where
people
over
the
age
of
35,
or
whatever,
typically
don't
engage
in
violent
activity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
