justice
antonin
scalia
no
sentence
can
be
--
can
be
imposed
rarely?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
a
sentence
is
imposed
rarely,
it
becomes
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
your
position?
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
make
it
crueler
to
him.
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
crueler
to
an
adolescent
than
it
is
to
--
what
--
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
at
21?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
if
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
he
--
he
could
sentence
up
to
1
year
before
the
life
expectancy
of
the
--
of
the
person
in
prison?
that
--
that
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's
he
supposed
to
do?
how
many
years
can
he
give--
justice
antonin
scalia
--consecutive?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
obviously
does.
what
do
you
propose?
i
propose,
you
know,
1
year
before
his
life
expectancy.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
1
year
before
life
is
also
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
two
years
before
life?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
--
the
same
kind
of
freedom
that
people
on
death
row
have?
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--aren't
they
released
into
the
general
population
for
exercise,
for
--
which
i
don't
think
death
row
inmates
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
doubt
whether
this
varies.
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
principle
where
if
you
are
in
for
life,
you
are
in
solitary.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
assume
--
doesn't
your
argument
assume
that
the
only
purpose
of
punishment
is
deterrence
in
the
sense
of
protecting
society
from
this
person
in
the
future,
so
that,
you
know,
once
that's
no
longer
a
problem,
we
should
let
this
person
out.
but
that
isn't
the
only
purpose
of
punishment
that
we've
acknowledged.
one
of
the
purposes
is
retribution,
punishment
for
just
perfectly
horrible
actions.
and
i
don't
know
why
that
value
of
retribution
diminishes
to
the
point
of
zero
when
it's
a
person
who's,
you
know,
17
years
9
months
old.
justice
antonin
scalia
most
states
didn't
--
don't
think
so,
or
many
states
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
sure,
but
you
can
make
that
claim
in
florida
courts,
can't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
you
argue
in
florida
courts
that
this
sentence
is
disproportionate
and
violates
the
eighth
amendment,
whereupon
the
florida
courts
would
have
to
decide?
wouldn't
they
have
to
decide
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere
only
if
we
accept
your
approach
that
there
has
to
be
a
categorical
exemption.
a
line
does
not
have
to
be
drawn
somewhere
if
you
adopt
the
approach
of,
case
by
case,
decide
whether
this
is
proportional,
given
how
old
the
individual
was,
given
the
nature
of
the
crimes,
and
all
of
the
other
factors.
you
don't
have
to
draw
a
line
then,
and
that's
the
attraction
of
that
approach.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
the
trial
judge
under
florida
law
does
not
have
discretion
to
choose
a
lower
sentence
because
of
the
--
of
tender
years
of
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
historical
perspective?
i
mean,
you
might
appeal
to
the
fact
that
at
common
law,
which
was
in
effect
when
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
was
adopted,
12
years
was
--
was
viewed
as
the
year
when
a
--
when
a
person
reaches
the
age
of
reason.
and
--
and
the
death
penalty
could
not
be
inflicted
on
anyone--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
all
felonies
were
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
we
apply
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
means
whatever
seems
--
seems
like
a
good
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
say
the
same
thing
of
--
of
adults,
of
somebody
over
18.
you
really
can't
tell
how
redeemable
this
individual
is
until
he
is
in
prison
for
some
time;
and,
therefore,
you
should
not
give
anybody
life
without
parole.
they
--
they
may
all
be
savable.
so
we
should
defer
--
defer.
we
shouldn't
have
any
non-parole
sentences.
everybody
should
be
evaluated,
which
was
indeed
the
approach
that
--
that
many
jurisdictions
used
to
take.
wasn't
that
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
there
was
parole
for
everybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
there's
also
no
empiricism
on
whether
the
committed
juvenile
feels
a
lot
better
knowing
that
he
will
get
out
when
he
is
75
years
old
than
he
would
feel
knowing
that
he
was
there
for
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
empirical
studies
about
how
much
that
improves
the
spirits
of
the
committed
juvenile?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
are
not
sure
that
those
70-year
sentences
are
any
good,
either,
because
your
--
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
you
know,
is
not
willing
to
--
to
pick
a
number
at
which
the
sentence
amounts
to
life
without
parole.
maybe
a
70-year
sentence
does.
