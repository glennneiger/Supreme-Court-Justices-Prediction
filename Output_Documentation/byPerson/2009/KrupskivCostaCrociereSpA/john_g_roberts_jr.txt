chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
09-337,
krupski
v.
costa
crociere,
s.
p.
a.
mr.
bendure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
--
your
client
tripped
over
the
cable,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
case
were
there
were
two
people
behind
her
and
she
was
pushed?
and
she
didn't
know
which
one
pushed
her,
jones
or
smith.
so
she
sues
jones,
and
smith
knows
all
about
it
because,
of
course,
he's
a
key
witness
or
whatever.
can
he
be
substituted
later
on
because
he
was
the
person
she
should
have
sued?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
just
the
real
name.
it's
not
that
jones
pushed
her,
but
his
real
name
is
johnson.
it's
that
jones
--
whoever
pushed
her;
i
forget
--
but
one
guy--
[laughter]
one
of
the
people
pushed
her,
and
she
named
that
--
she
named
the
other
person.
she
made
a
mistake
about
who
pushed
her.
can
they
have
substitution
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
the
non-pusher
has
notice--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
everything
else.
but
there's
no
relationship
between
the
two
of
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
glazier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
the
--
the
definition
of
carrier
includes
independent
contractors.
i
mean
--
i
--
i
would
--
other
than
that
they
are
more
closely
related,
i
can
see
someone
thinking,
well,
costa
cruise
is
at
least
an
independent
contractor
with
which
costa
crociere
does
business.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
don't
--
i
mean,
there's
some
sharp
practice
going
on
here.
paragraph
10
of
their
complaint
sues
costa
cruise
lines
because
--
saying
they
owned,
operated,
managed,
supervised,
and
controlled
the
ocean-going
passenger
vessel.
and
it's
the
same
lawyer
for
costa
cruise
as
for
costa
crociere,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
that
lawyer
looks
at
this
and
says:
aha,
they
made
a
mistake;
they
named
the
cruise
line
rather
than
the
name
in
italian.
so
i'm
going
to
wait
until
the
statute
of
limitations
runs,
and
then
a
couple
of
days
after,
i'm
going
to
say
aha.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
would
have
said
the
previous
paragraph,
9,
says:
"the
plaintiff
has
complied
with
all
the
pre-suit
requirements
of
the
passenger
ticket.
"
so
you
know
they
read
the
ticket.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
which
is
it?
is
that
a
freudian
slip?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
a
mistake.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bendure,
you
have
9
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
would
have
been:
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
equity
at
all.
it's
just
the
interpretation
of
a
legal
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
09-337
krupski
versus
costa
crociere.
