m.

let
me
--
i've
been
thinking
about
the
chief
justice's
question
where
the
two
people
are
pushed
and
you
don't
know
which
person
--
or
two
people
fired
the
shotgun,
and
there's
only
one
pellet,
and
you
don't
know
which
gun
the
pellet
came
from.
in
that
case,
i
think
we
could
stipulate
that
even
by
reasonable
inquiry,
you
wouldn't
know.
in
your
case,
i
think
the
--
and
i
think
the
difference
in
the
case
is
that
"reasonable
inquiry"
means
you
should
have
known.
so
now
we
have
a
rule
that
excuses
something
you
should
have
known
but
doesn't
excuse
something
you
--
you
couldn't
have
known,
which
seems
odd.
and
because
it's
odd,
therefore,
maybe
that's
why
it
only
applies
to
clerical
errors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
your
amended
complaint
contain
any
new
and
material
allegations
other
than
the
name
correction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
it's
below
them,
you
mean
it
owns
all
the
shares
in
its
--
in
its
subsidiary
company?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
--
one
question
about
the
face
of
the
ticket,
the
one
with
the
picture
on
it.
is
it
costa
cruise
or
costa
crociere
that
got
this
big
award
for
b.e.s.t.

["]?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pardon
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
make
the
assumption
that
it's
the
cruise
line,
crociere,
that
got
the
award.
so
the
ticket
itself
confuses
the
two
companies.
is
that
a
mistake,
incidentally?
[laughter]
if
i
am
right,
is
that
a
mistake?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
many
--
if
you
have
a
1,000-page
ticket,
how
many
pages
do
you
have
to
read?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
is
the
first
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
one
i
pointed
out
to
you
with
the
mistake,
that's
the
first
one.
