justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
--
i
didn't
understand
you
to
deny
that
the
ticket
made
it
very
clear
who
operated
the
ship.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
contest
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
not?
don't
you
read
the
contract
carefully
before
you
bring
a
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
--
you
either
are
contesting
or
you're
not
contesting
that
it's
clear
from
the
ticket.
i
had
assumed
it
was
clear
from
the
ticket.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
had
--
so
then
you
had
notice
even
before
the
suit
was
filed.
it
was
on
the
--
it
was
on
the
ticket.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
--
not
if
you
read
the
definitions
on
page
1.
and
if
you
are
not
going
to
read
all
11
pages
before
you
file
suit,
i
would
think
you
would
at
least
read
page
1.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
made
it
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
the
only
condition
was
that
it
had
to
arise
out
of
the
same
event
or
transaction,
which
would
give
you
much
more
running
room
than
--
than
what
you
assert.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bendure,
can
--
can
i
come
back
to
your
--
i'm
not
sure
why
it
matters,
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
giving
too
narrow
an
interpretation,
and
i
would
not
like
our
opinion
to
read
any
more
narrowly
than
the
statute
allows.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
assert
a
different
claim
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction,
you
would
be
able
to
amend.
if
you
will
look
at
(c)(1)(c),
which
is
what
you're
asserting
here,
right?
(c)(1)(c)
says,
"the
amendment
changes
the
party
or
the
naming
of
party
against
whom
the
claim
is
asserted,
if
rule
15(c)(1)(b)
is
satisfied.
"
then
you
go
back
to
(1)(b)
and
it
says,
"the
amendment
asserts
a
claim
or
defense
that
arose
out
of
the
conduct,
transaction,
or
occurrence
set
out.
"
it
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be
the
same
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
that's
why
i
don't
understand
why
you're
arguing
a
more
narrow
--
a
more
narrow
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you're
home
free
with
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes,
but
--
but
those
are
the
only
things
we
--
we
have
to
argue
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
doubt
that
you
are
asserting
--
even
if
you
were
asserting
a
different
claim,
it
certainly
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
event,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
wife
made
a
mistake.
i
don't
think
you
made
a
mistake.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
19a
of
the
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
am
not
following
it.
where
--
where
--
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
but
he's
talking
about
constructive
notice--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
--
by
the
defendant,
not
constructive
knowledge
by
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
says
it
includes
stewards.
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
includes
the
stewards
on
the
boat,
according
to
your
--
your
friend.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that
--
that
assumes
--
that
assumes
--
when,
what
is
it,
1(c)(ii),
4(m).
now,
in
the
early
part
of
that
period,
at
--
at
one
point
in
the
period
you
should
have
known.
and
at
another
point,
because
the
answer
was
filed,
you
shouldn't
have
known.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
they
filed
an
answer
which
--
i'm
sorry
--
that
--
that
you
filed
an
answer
which
made
it
very
clear
to
them
what
the
situation
was.
but
was
there
any
point,
any
--
and
all
it
takes
i
think
is
any
point
within
that
4(m)
period
--
when
you
--
you
knew
or
should
have
known?
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
--
assuming
the
lawyer
would
just
look
at
the
cover
before
he
files
a
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
object
to
your
relying
upon
the
--
the
answer
as
--
as
establishing
compliance
with
(c)(ii),
because
(c),
in
the
prologue,
says
"is
satisfied,
if
within
the
period
provided
by
rule
4(m).
"
and
there
is
at
least
some
point
within
that
period
before
the
answer
was
filed.
and
if,
within
that
period
before
the
answer,
you
knew
or
should
have
known
that
it
was
a
mistake,
it
seems
to
me
you
lose.
do
you
understand
what
i'm
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
--
the
only
thing
you
could
rely
on
for
that
short
period
before
the
answer
is
filed
is
simply
the
ticket,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
are
reading
"within
the
period"
to
mean
"throughout
the
period".
it
doesn't
say
"throughout
the
period".
it
says
"if
within
the
period".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
an
important
issue
with
respect
to
the
statute.
i
don't
think
we
can
treat
cavalierly
whether
"within
the
period"
means
"throughout
the
period".
that's
one
of
the
issues
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
sort
of
an
equitable
rule,
isn't
it,
this
mistake?
we're
going
to,
you
know
--
equity
takes
account
of
such
things.
it
seems
to
me
very
reasonable
to
say:
if
the
mistake
is
egregious,
it
doesn't
apply.

antonin
scalia
