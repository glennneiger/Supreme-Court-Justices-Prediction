yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--being
realistic
about
it,
as
i
understand
it
you're
relying
entirely
on
the
condition,
general
conditions
of
passage
in
the
ticket,
the
fine
print
describing
the
term
"carrier".
that's
--
but
do
you
take
into
account
that
the
cover
of
the
ticket,
which
is
what
the
passenger
would
look
at,
uses
"costa
cruises",
blah,
blah,
blah
--
"costa
cruise
lines"
and
so
--
and
doesn't
even
mention
the
carrier?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think,
looking
at
that
ticket,
if
you
were
a
passenger
you
would
think
you
were
doing
business
with
costa
cruise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
looking
at
the
cover?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
that
on
the
cover
of
the
ticket,
the
italian
name
isn't
used
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
that
what
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
the
passenger
would
normally
look
at,
understand
who
he
is
doing
business
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
question
is
whether
the
lawyer
made
a
mistake.
isn't
that
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
did
make
a
mistake.
justice
john
paul
stevens
despite
that,
they
made
a
mistake.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
made
a
mistake,
right?
they
read
the
ticket,
and
despite
that,
they
made
a
mistake.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
--
why
doesn't
the
rule
cover
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
puzzled,
because
rule
(c)
just
requires
--
describes
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant,
correct?
c(i)
and
(ii);
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
true
that
under
(i),
the
defendant
did
receive
such
notice
of
the
action,
would
not
be
prejudiced?
that's
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
also
true
that
at
the
time
they
received
the
complaint,
they
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
action
would
have
been
brought
against
the
carrier
instead
of
the
broker?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
understand
how
you
get
around
the
plain
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
--
you
don't
think
that
the
agent
didn't
realize
that
they
would
have
sued
the
carrier
if
they
had
known
the
identity
of
the
right
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
all
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we're
talking
about
the
--
about
mindset
of
the
defendant,
and
to
say
that
they
wouldn't
have
sued
--
they
would
have
sued
the
broker
instead
of
this
carrier?
it's
absurd.
