bader

do
you
know,
mr.
bendure,
what
exactly
the
corporate
relationship
was
between
the
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
first
--
when
was
your
first
notice
of
that?
i
mean,
it
was
on
the
first
page
of
the
ticket,
but
the
answer
came
after
the
statute
of
limitations.
was
that
your
first
notice
that
there
was
this
different
entity,
or
did
you
know
that
earlier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
--
did
the
name
show
up
any
place
other
than
page
1
of
the
general
conditions
of
passage?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
--
and
this
is
what?
an
11-page,
very
small
print--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
bendure,
would
you
explain
one
factual
matter
to
me?
i
might
have
gotten
this
wrong,
but
i
thought
the
answer
was
filed
after
the
1
year
had
run.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
when
the
answer
was
filed
it
was
too
late
for
you
to
come
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
thought
that
would
be
the
answer
that
you
would
give
to
justice
sotomayor,
because
when
you
got
the
answer
--
which
was
filed
after
how
many
days?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
had
gotten
that
a
few
days
earlier,
you
could
have
amended,
and
then
we
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
basic
point
is
the
answer
didn't
come
in
until
you
were
already
out
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
from
their
point
of
view,
nothing
else
matters;
you
were
out
when
they
filed
their
answer,
and
you
could
do
nothing
to
cure
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bendure,
in
addition
to
the
mailing
of
the
ticket
--
the
mailing
of
the
ticket
came;
it
said
"costa
cruise"
--
were
there
any
other
connections
between
the
plaintiff
passenger
and
costa
cruise
beyond
the
ticket
coming
in
an
envelope
that
says
"costa
cruise"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
glazier--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any
other
than
that
one
page
on
the
ticket,
that
against
the
mailing
envelopes
that
she
got
that
say
"costa
cruise"
--
is
there
anything
in
the
entire
record
other
than
that
definition
page
that
includes
carrier,
that
includes
steward,
anything
else
that
tips
her
off
that
this
is
a
different
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
relationship
between
those
corporations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
they
--
are
they
sister
corporations,
a
parent-sub--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
you
went
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
went
to
the
web
site,
which
was
mentioned,
for
costa
cruise,
there
would
be
a
tab
that
says
"our
ships"
"our
ships"
--
and
one
of
those
ships
is
costa
magica,
whatever.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"our
ships",
and
it
identifies
costa
cruise
as
the
cruise
operator.
that's
the
information
that's
given
to
passengers
in
the
united
states
who
are
going
to
book
on
these
ships.
it
says
costa
cruise,
our
ships,
costa
cruise
is
the
operator.
that's
what
was
being
put
forth
to
the
public.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
shouldn't
matter
that
this
confusion
was
caused
in
large
part
by
this
entity
that
advertises
in
english
under
the
name
"costa
cruise"
and
identifies
costa
cruise
as
the
operator.
"the
largest
european
cruise
operator"
is
how
costa
cruise
is
--
is
identified
in
--
in
the
advertising.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
answer
is
filed
conveniently
after
the
1-year
period
has
run.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
answer
say
the
statute
--
the
1-year
period
has
run?
was
that
raised
as
a
defense
in
the
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
was
it
raised
as
a
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
--
the
rule
4(m)
period
concerns
when
you
can
serve.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
any
more
than
what
was
the
term
of
the
--
of
the
passage,
was
1
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
--
where
is
the
defense
--
i
mean,
the
ticket
says
suit
must
be
filed
within
1
year
of
the
date
of
any
alleged
injury.
and
where
is
the
--
that
defense
stated?
you
said
it
comes
up
10
weeks--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
we
--
let's
clarify
that
point
now.
i
am
looking
at
3a,
which
is
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
it
says
that
"costa
crociere
moved
to
dismiss,
arguing
that
it
had
been
sued
after
the
1-year
ticket
period
allowed
for
claims
set
forth.
"
--as
set
forth
in
the
ticket.
then
the
rule
tells
us
that
you
have
this
much
time
to
serve,
and
then
the
complaint
will
--
the
--
the
amendment
will
relate
back
to
the
date
of
the
original
filing.
it
doesn't
change
your
statement,
your
defense.
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations
isn't
affected.
what
is
affected
is
the
complaint
will
relate
back
if
there's
an
amendment
filed.
but
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations
remains,
and
you
didn't
bother
to
answer
until
the
--
that
time
had
run.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
relation
back
is
different
from
the
point
at
which
the
statute
has
run.
the
statute
runs
after
1
year.
then,
if
she
does
what
the
rules
say,
it
can
relate
back
to
the
date
of
the
original
filing.
the
fact
remains
that
you
didn't
file
your
answer
until
after
the
limitation
period
had
run.
