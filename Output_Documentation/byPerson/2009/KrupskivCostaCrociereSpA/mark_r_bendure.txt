mr.
mark
r.
bendure
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
revolves
around
rule
15(c)(1)(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
in
pertinent
part,
if
two
subsections
are
--
are
satisfied,
the
rule
permits
relation
back
of
an
amendment
adding
a
new
defendant
after
expiration
of
the
limitations
period.
the
courts
below
found,
and
respondent
does
not
question,
that
we
satisfied
the
first
subsection:
notice
and
no
prejudice.
that
arose
from
the
service
of
the
original
complaint
upon
costa
cruise,
the
agent
and
corporate
affiliate
represented
by
the
same
attorney
as
respondent
costa
crociere.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
no,
your
honor,
not
the
corporate
relation.
the
functional
relationship
as
described
in
the
affidavit
is
that
costa
cruise
is
the
booking
agent
for
costa
crociere.
and
for
the
notice
procedure,
according
to
the
affidavit
of
mr.
klutz,
costa
cruise
engaged
the
irsi
adjustment
service
to
resolve
claims
arising
on
the
ship.
so
in
that
respect
it
was
also,
in
our
view,
an
agent
of
costa
crociere.
but
the
specific
corporate
relationship
is
not
known.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
because
of
that
timely
service
on
costa
cruise,
we
satisfied
the
first
subsection.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
schiavone,
timely
service
on
one
defendant
may
serve
to
give
imputed
notice
to
a
related
defendant,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
if
you're
talking
about
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
real
name,
probably--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--i
would
say
yes,
because
--
again,
assuming
that
all
of
the
other
criteria
are
satisfied.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
yes.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
it's
--
it's
obviously
a
slightly
different
and
more
difficult
case
from
our
perspective,
but
what
i
think
is
critical
is
the
status
that's
involved.
in
this
particular
case,
the
suit
was
filed
against
the
vessel
operator,
and
that
vessel
operator
was
identified
as
costa
cruise,
when
we
know
that
the
actual
identity
was
costa
crociere.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
it
was
--
we
say
that
was
the
first
notice.
now,
the
circuit
court
used
an
imputed
knowledge
rationale
to
suggest
that
the
inclusion
of
the
name
"costa
crociere"
within
the
definitions
section
gave
us
what
i
would
call
constructive
notice.
but
in
terms
of
actual
knowledge
that
--
that
we
had
sued
the
wrong
party,
it
was
the
answer
which
was
filed
after--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--i'm
not
sure--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--i
contest
that
it
makes
it
very
clear,
but
i
don't
contest
that
one
could
conclude
that
that
provided
constructive
notice,
that
if
read
carefully
one
might
infer.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
well,
actually
it
was
under
definitions.
and
according
to
the
definitions,
costa
crociere
fell
within
the
same
definition
of
"carrier"
as
the
steward,
the
ship
itself,
any--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--i'm
not
--
i
am
not
agreeing
that
it's
clear.
i
am
agreeing
that
it
provides
constructive
notice
from
which
one
might
infer
that.
not
clear,
but
discernible.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
we
had
what
the
circuit
court
referred
to
as
"imputed
knowledge".
now,
i
think
there's
a--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
it's
an
11-page,
small
print
document.
and
one
thing
that
bears
mention
is
that
reference
is
under
the
designation
"definitions",
because
respondent
makes
some
hay
out
of
the
fact
that
we
complied
with
other
requirements
which
are
under
a
different
heading
which
says
"limitations
of
liability".
but
what
we
also
had
was
that
we
purchased
the
ticket
from
costa
cruise;
it
was
sent
by
costa
cruise.
we
had
the
pre-suit
notice
sent
to
costa
cruise,
responded
by
the
--
the
gentleman
under
the
heading
"costa"
that
says
"claims
administrator
for
costa
cruise".
so
there
was
certainly
what
i
would
call
conflicting
information
at
best
about
which
was
the
name
of
the
actual
vessel
operator--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--well,
it
--
well,
under
the
same
definition,
the
steward
would
be
a
carrier
every
bit
as
much
as
costa
crociere,
s.
p.
a.
so
it
seems
to
me
by
that
reasoning
you
could
conclude
that
the
steward
or
the
janitor
is
the
vessel
operator
because
they
are
likewise
defined
as
the
carrier
in
that
definitional
section.
and,
in
fact,
it
also
includes
the
vessel
itself
within
the
definition.
so
let's
assume
that
my
client
had,
instead
of
suing
costa
cruise,
sued
costa
magica,
the
name
of
the
vessel
itself.
most
of
the
cases
would
say
that
an
amendment
like
that
to
add
the
actual
name,
once
you
have
identified
the
status
of
the
defendant
you
seek
to
sue,
falls
within
the
subsection
(ii),
which
is
addressed
primarily
to
the
constructive
notice
of
the
defendant,
that
they
knew
or
should
have
known
that
they
would
have
been
brought
in
the
suit
but
for
a
mistake
concerning
the
proper
party's
identity.
but
the
general
focus
of
that
second
subsection,
i
think,
is
to
look
to
whether
this
defendant
knew
or
should
have
known
that
it
was
the
intended
target.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
well,
actually
when
it
talks
of
mistake,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
notion
of
mistake
connotes
error.
i
looked
at
a
couple
of
definitions,
dictionary
definitions.
merriam
webster's
defines
a
mistake
as,
quote,
"a
wrong
judgment"
or,
quote,
"a
wrong
action
or
statement
proceeding
from
faulty
judgment,
inadequate
knowledge,
or
inattention.
"
so,
at
least
in
that
colloquial
sense,
the
very
nature
of
mistake
implies
some
measure
of
blameworthiness.
and,
indeed,
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
a
mistake
that
couldn't
be
avoided.
and
i
think
that's
the
problem
with
looking
to
the
ticket,
because
what
the
definition
on
the
ticket
essentially
says
is:
with
due
diligence,
you
might
have
avoided
the
mistake.
but
in
my
view,
and
i
think
in
the
view
of
the
language
of
the
rule,
that
doesn't
change
the
very
nature
of
it
as
being
a
mistake.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
certainly.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
i
think--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--let
me
respond
both
legally
and
factually.
legally,
i
submit
that
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
because
under
the
text
of
the
rule
if
during
that
4(m)
period
they
had
the
knowledge
that
you're
suggesting
and
which
would
be
suggested
by
the
respondent
when
they
say,
i
think,
if
you
had
filed
the
amended
complaint
and
served
it
a
month
after
the
answer,
it
would
have
been
timely,
we
would
have
done
it.
that
acknowledges
that
there
was
a
mistake,
and
once
there
is
a
mistake,
if
during
that
120-day
period
they
knew
or
should
have
known
that
it
would
have
been
brought
against
them
but
for
the
mistake,
that
knowledge
doesn't
evaporate
by
later
events,
as
long
as
there
is
knowledge
during
that
period.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
okay.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
let
me
point
out
factually
--
and
i
did
not
stress
it
in
my
brief.
the
answer
was
filed
on
february
25th.
twenty-three
days
later,
on
march
20th,
the
court
entered
a
scheduling
order
which
said:
you
have
until
the
end
of
june
to
amend
your
complaint
to
add
parties.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
a
defendant
faced
with
a
court
order
that
says
the
time
for
amendment
extends
till
the
end
of
june
would
not
be
drawing
any
conclusions
that
the
plaintiff's
state
of
mind
had
changed.
and
one
difficulty
with
trying
to
look
at
different
points
during
the
120-day
period
is
that
it
seems
to
me
you'd
have
a
constantly
moving
target.
if
you
say
that
we
satisfied
120(m)
at
one
point
in
time
but
somehow
that's
not
enough
and
at
a
later
point
in
time
maybe
they
didn't
know
it
any
more,
and
then
perhaps
i
guess
in
theory
you
could
have
them
again
--
if
we
had
sent
them
a
letter
even
after
that
and
said,
you
know,
we
really
did
mean
it,
and
then
for
some
reason
they
concluded
otherwise,
you'd
have
a
constantly
moving
target.
and
that's--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--it
had.
it
had.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
absolutely
true.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
it
was
filed
i
think
24
days
after
the
complaint.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
that's
certainly
true,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
also--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--no,
your
honor.
the
120
days
is
the
time
frame
for
the
notice
to
the
defendant.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
it
--
120
days
after
the
amended
complaint
is
our
time
for
service
of
the
amended--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--complaint
on
the
new
defendant.
but
i
think
the
point
that
is
raised
by
justice
ginsburg
is
this:
once
we
find
out
and
the
limitation
period
has
already
expired,
school's
out.
if
we
tried
to
amend
immediately
thereafter
--
if
we
hadn't
made
a
mistake
--
we
couldn't
amend
1
day
after
expiration
of
the
limitation
period.
so
if
we
had
acted
immediately,
we
still
don't
get
relation
back
unless
we've
satisfied
the
two
criteria
of
the
subsections.
but
if
we
do
satisfy
those
within
the
120-day
period,
then
we
fall
in
the
safe
haven
provided
by
the
rule
whether
the
amendment
itself
occurs
1
week,
3
weeks,
or
7
weeks
afterwards.
that--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--correct.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
we
could
do
nothing
to,
as
a
matter
of
right,
file
within
the
limitation
period.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
it
actually
was
a
second
count,
but
it
was
the
same
allegations
against
costa
crociere
that
had
been
made
against
costa
cruise.
we
did
not
amend
the
theories
of
liability.
and,
again,
getting
back
to
the
question
of
status
and
theories,
i
think
that's
the
critical
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
cases
they
rely
upon,
ish
yerushalayim
and
things
like
that,
where
you're
changing
from
an
individual
defendant
to
an
institutional
defendant
or
vice
versa
on
a
different
theory.
and,
of
course,
you
couldn't
mistake
an
individual
for
an
institution.
and
that
i
think
is
the
line
of
demarcation
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
draw,
and
it
explains
why
in
the
lower
courts
the
decisions
which
present
our
paradigm
all
or
virtually
all
allow
relation
back;
whereas,
those
that
seek
to
amend
a
change
from
an
individual
to
a
corporation
or
vice
versa
often
don't
permit
relation
back--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--only
if
you're
amending
against
the
same
defendant.
if
you
are
adding
a
new
defendant,
you
have
to
satisfy
(i)
and
(ii),
which
look
to
the
notice
and
reason
to
know
of
the
new
defendant.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
there
was
the
--
the
pre-suit
claims
notice
which
was
sent
to
costa
cruise
at
the
florida
address,
in
attempted
compliance
with
the
provision
of
the
ticket
which
says
you
must
file
notice
to
the
carrier
before
filing
suit.
and
you
have
to
do
that
within
185
days.
so
we
not
only
got
the
ticket
from
costa
cruise
--
we
bought
it
from
costa
cruise
--
the
ticket
itself,
if
you
look
at
i
think
it's
25a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
there
is
a
prominent
page
which
says
"costa
cruise,
cruise
company"
next
to
a
picture
of
the
vessel.
so
we
have
that.
then
when
we
filed
the
notice,
we
sent
it
to
costa
cruise,
we
get
a
letter
back
from
a
person
who
claims
to
be
in
a
position
to
resolve
the
liability
of
the
vessel
over
--
owner,
signed
by
him
as
claims
administrator
for
costa
cruise.
those
are
the
things
--
oh,
and
then
we
have,
prior
to
the
commencement
of
suit,
the
internet
investigation
about
which
florida
company
is
registered
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
michigan,
and
we
look
at
the
costa
cruise
web
site,
which
says:
"costa
crociere
with
several
offices
in
several
countries,
united
states
office,
costa
cruise,
florida.
"
so
those
are
some
of
the
things
which
give
rise
to
the
mistake--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--there's
no
question
we
satisfy
that.
everybody
agrees.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
because
i'm
forced
to--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--unfortunately,
(c)
then
goes
on
and
says:
"and
if,
within
the
period
provided.
"
(i)
and
(ii).
so--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
certainly.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
additional
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
obviously,
from
the
questions,
the
court
has
a
good
grasp
of
the
facts
and
the
issues
in
our
arguments.
i'd
just
like
to
clarify
a
couple
of
factual
points.
the
district
court
ruling
didn't
rely
on
the
ticket
at
all.
what
the
district
court
said
was:
i
adopt
the
legal
premise
that
if
you
knew
before
the
filing
of
--
before
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
but
didn't
sue,
that
would
not
be
a
mistake.
and
here,
says
the
district
court
judge,
they
filed
their
answer
after
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
that's
why
you
lose
under
a
rule
that
requires
that
notice
before
the
statute
of
limitations
expires.
that
was
the
district
court
rationale.
the
circuit
court
was
the
one
who
relied
upon
the
imputed
knowledge
notion
that
is
now,
i
think,
disavowed
by
respondent
himself.
with
regard
to
the--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--i
think
now
one
gets
into
a
wonderful
process
of
trying
to
identify
mistakes
on
a
scale
of
egregiousness.
like,
how
many
points
of
egregiousness
would
it
take?
and
i
think
that's
beyond
the
statute,
or
the
court
rule
itself,
which
just
uses
the
plain
language
"mistake".
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
certainly.
and
the
rule
itself
--
i
understood
justice
scalia's
point
to
be
that
the
interpretation
of
the
rule
is
designed
to
be
liberal
in
its
application
to
avoid
the
forfeiture
of
potentially
meritorious
causes
of
action
over
technical
mistakes
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits.
i
thought
that
was
the
sense
in
which
you
used
the
word
"equitable".
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
even
though
it's,
in
my
view,
legally
insignificant,
is
their
argument
regarding
the
nature
of
the
delay.
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed
on
may
6th.
two
days
later,
the
court
erroneously
dismissed
the
lawsuit
for
a
period
of
approximately
a
month.
it
was
then
reinstated
on
june
5th,
and
our
response,
which
sought
relation
back,
was
filed
on
june
13th.
so
in
addition
to
the
scheduling
order,
there
is
a
1-month
period
of
time
in
which
the
case
was
erroneously
dismissed.
so
if
it
were
significant,
we
could
say
there's
not
significant
delay.
but
the
ultimate
point
is
it's
legally
beside
the
point.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--it
may
well--
mr.
mark
r.
bendure
--i
don't
know.
i'm
not
a
maritime
lawyer,
your
honor.
but
i
think
certainly
if
the
court's
opinion
were
to
note
it,
the
maritime
commission
might
well
