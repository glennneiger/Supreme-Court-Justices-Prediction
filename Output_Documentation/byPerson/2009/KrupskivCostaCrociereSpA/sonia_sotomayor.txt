justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assume
i
accept
your
argument,
and
i
am
the
cruise
operator
--
the
cruise
owner,
cruise
ship
owner,
and
i
look
at
the
complaint,
and
i
say:
i
think
they
really
meant
me,
but
--
i
think.
now,
within
the
4(m)
period,
which
is
the
period
in
which
i
am
supposed
to
reasonably
know
that
i
would
have
been
named
absent
a
mistake,
here
an
answer
is
filed,
and
you
are
told
there
is
a
mistake,
and
you
don't
correct
the
mistake.
what
conclusion
would
a
reasonable
person
at
that
second
juncture
make
about
whether
you
made
a
mistake
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
i
think
that's
what
the
issue
is
here,
which
is,
assuming
the
complaint
could
be
read
as
a
mistake
during
the
4(m)
period,
wasn't
that
mistake
corrected,
and
you
refused
or
failed
to
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
makes
so
little
sense
to
me.
here
i
think
--
and
for
the
following
reason:
you
seriously
i
don't
think
could
contend
that
if
you
had
sought
to
amend
a
year
later,
that
that
would
have
been
timely,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
but
putting
aside
prejudice--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
the
lower
court
said
was
because
your
delay
speaks
to
a
choice,
that
that's
the
only
thing
a
reasonable
defendant
would
have
assumed,
that
having
been
told
that
you
sued
the
wrong
party
and
you
continued
in
that
action,
that
that's
what
you
intended
to
do,
to
sue
that
wrong
party.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
you
have
120
days
to
amend,
don't
you,
from
the
filing
of
the
complaint?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
complaint.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
can't
costa
cruise
be
perceived
to
hold
one
of
those
roles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
not
what
the
rule
says.
the
rule
doesn't
talk
about
what
kind
of
mistake
or
why.
the
rule
says
what
the
defendant
should
have
known.
and
so,
when
you
read
this
complaint,
it's
very
clear
you
know
you're
the
carrier.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
know
cruise
--
the
other
line,
the
sales
agent,
can't
be
the
carrier,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
either
a
factual
or
a
legal
mistake.
there
is
no
other
way
to
read
that
other
than
that
there
is
a
mistake.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
--
then
have
you
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question,
which
is:
what
conceivable
reason
that
is
not
either
negligence
or
unintentional
or
inadvertent
or
just
plain
stupidity,
however
you
want
to
define
it,
that
someone
who
is
injured
would
want
to
name
a
party
who
wasn't
responsible
for
the
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but,
counsel,
don't
--
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
whether
once
the
answer
was
filed,
they
were
dilatory
in
making
their
motion.
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
argue
that
the
day
you
received
this
complaint,
you
didn't
understand
that
some
sort
of
mistake
had
been
made.
the
day
that
the
answer
came
in,
you
might
start
to
have
a
doubt
because
of
their
delay
in
the
motion
to
amend,
but
doesn't
that
go
to
a
15(a)
question,
whether
the
judge
should
have
given
leave
to
amend
because
of
dilatory
tactics?
isn't
that
a
15(a)
question,
not
a
15(c)
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
anything
in
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
would
suggest
anything
but
a
mistake?
now,
forget
--
i'm
being
very
specific.
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
you
read
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
does
it
say
that?
where
does
it
say:
"i
know
that
the
carrier
is
costa
crociere?
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
the
complaint
says
is
that
costa
cruise,
the
operator
of
the
vessel,
injured
me,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
is
that
an
accurate
statement
of
fact?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
rule
15(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
governs
when
an
amended
pleading
“relate
backs”
to
the
date
of
a
timely
filed
original
pleading
and
is
thus
itself
timely
even
though
it's
filed
outside
an
applicable
statute
of
limitations.
where
an
amended
pleading
changes
a
party
or
party’s
name,
the
rule
requires
among
other
things
that
within
a
certain
time
period
after
the
pleading
was
filed,
“party
to
be
brought
in
by
amendment
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
action
would've
been
brought
against
it
but
for
a
mistake
concerning
the
proper
party's
identity”.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
here
was
a
passenger
on
a
cruise
ship
when
she
tripped
and
broke
her
leg.
to
recover
for
her
injury,
she
sued
a
company
called
costa
cruise
which
had
issued
her
ticket.
costa
cruise
responded
that
she
should
have
sued
a
related
company
called
costa
--
i
am
going
to
ask
my
colleague
justice
scalia
to
say
it
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
crociere--
i
want
to
put
the
spanish
accent
on
it.
crociere
instead
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired,
she
amended
her
complaint
to
add
costa
crociere
but
the
district
court
held
that
her
complaint
did
not
relate
back
because
she
had
chosen
to
sue
costa
cruise
instead
of
costa
crociere
and
thus
had
not
made
a
“mistake
concerning
the
party
of
the
proper
party's
identity.”
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
two
grounds,
it
first
held
that
rule
15(c)
was
not
satisfied
because
the
plaintiff
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
proper
defendant
before
filing
her
original
complaint.
the
court
also
held
that
relation
of
that
was
not
appropriate
because
the
plaintiff
had
unduly
delayed
in
seeking
to
amend.
we
hold
that
neither
of
these
reasons
was
a
proper
ground
on
which
to
deny
relation
back,
relation
back
under
rule
15(c)
depends
on
what
the
party
to
be
added
knew
or
should
have
known,
not
on
the
amending
the
party's
knowledge
or
timeliness
in
amending,
this
is
clear
from
the
text
of
the
rule
which
focuses
on
what
the
party
to
be
added
knew
or
should
have
known.
moreover
that
a
plaintiff
knows
of
a
party's
existence
does
not
preclude
her
from
making
a
mistake
with
respect
to
the
party's
identity,
making
a
deliberate
choice
to
sue
one
party
instead
of
another
while
fully
understanding
the
factual
and
legal
difference
between
the
two
parties
is
the
antithesis
of
making
a
mistake
concerning
the
proper
party's
identity.
however
a
plaintiff
may
choose
to
sue
one
defendant
over
another,
based
on
a
misunderstanding
about
their
own
identities
that
kind
of
deliberate
but
mistaken
choice
should
not
foreclose
a
finding
that
rule
15(c)
has
been
satisfied.
similarly
there
is
no
support
in
the
rule
for
the
conclusion
that
a
plaintiff’s
dilatory
conduct
can
justify
the
denial
of
relation
back
under
rule
15(c).
the
rule
sets
forth
an
exclusive
list
of
requirements
and
the
plaintiff's
diligence
is
not
among
them.
under
these
principles,
the
court
below
erred
and
in
denying
relation
back.
the
plaintiff's
original
complaint
explained
that
she
meant
to
sue
the
company
that
“owned,
operated,
managed,
supervised
and
controlled
the
ship
on
which
she
was
injured”.
that
complaint
also
indicated
mistakenly
that
costa
cruise
performed
these
roles
because
costa
crociere
had
constructive
knowledge
of
the
complaint
within
the
time
period
specified
by
the
rule,
it
should
have
known
that
it
was
not
named
as
a
defendant
in
that
complaint,
only
because
of
the
plaintiff's
misunderstanding
about
which
costa
entity
was
in
charge
of
the
ship.
clearly
“a
mistake
concerning
the
proper
party's
identity”.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
