justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
no
mistake
if
you
happen
to
know
it,
if
you
happen
to
know
who
the
right
party
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ever?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
ever
driven
a
car
where
your
wife
has
said
turn
left
and
you've
turned
right?
[laughter]
has
that
ever
happened
to
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
anything
you
didn't
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
asking
about
this
question,
my
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
anything
you
didn't
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
did
you
do
it
by
mistake?
yes,
of
course,
you
did.
it's
happened
to
every
human
being.
there
are
millions
of
instances
in
which
people
do
things
by
mistake
where,
in
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
my
wife
does
not
make
mistakes.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
make
mistakes,
and
sometimes
i
make
mistakes
knowing
all
the
facts,
and
so
do
you
and
so
does
everybody
else.
so
i
never
heard
of
this
thing
that
you
can't
make
a
mistake
knowing
all
the
facts.
but
anyway,
here
we
have
a
person
who
didn't
know
all
the
facts.
what
the
judge
says
is
he
should
have
known
all
the
facts.
where
in
the
record
does
he
say
he
did
know
all
the
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different
matter.
my
wife
told
me
to
turn
left
and
i
turned
right,
okay?
but
i
didn't
take
it
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
a
different
matter.
where
does
it
say
that
he
did
know
the
facts
as
opposed
to
he
should
have
known
the
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
the
citations
to
the
page.
i
wasn't
challenging
you.
i
just
wanted
the
citations
to
the
page--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
there's
a
finding
that,
in
fact,
he
knew
that
this
company
called
"costa
cruise"
in
italian
is
the
same
as
the
company
called
"costa
cruise"
in
english?
i
take
it
"crociere"
means
"cruise".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
one
is
called
"costa
cruise"
in
italian
and
one
is
called
"costa
cruise"
in
english.
and
i
just
want
to
know
where
it
says
in
the
record
that
the
client
or
he,
the
lawyer,
actually
knew,
actually
knew
that
he
should
have
sued
the
one
that
spells
its
name
in
italian?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
ask
you
that
question.
i'm
asking
for
a
record
citation
as
to
where
there
is
a
finding
that
this
particular
plaintiff
knew
that
the
italian
company
called
"costa
cruise"
was
in
fact
the
one
he
should
have
sued?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
write
them
down
and
look
at
them
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
what
the
district
court
said
was
"impute"
the
knowledge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
where
does
it
say
that
on
19a?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
--
i
know.
i
would
say
in
reading
this,
that
both
courts
have
made
the
most
elementary
mistake
of
the
english
language
in
thinking
that
when
a
person
doesn't
know
something
but
should
have
known
it,
that
that's
inconsistent
with
a
mistake.
that's
the
very
definition
of
a
mistake.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
all
i
want
is
some
citation
from
you
that
shows
that
isn't
what
they
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
the
conclusion,
and
when
i
read
two
sentences
down,
it
said
they
may
have
had
constructive
knowledge.
the
word
"constructive"
to
me,
when
i
hear
i
want
to
run
out
the
door,
because
what
the
word
"constructive"
to
me
means
is
not
knowledge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
on
page
19a.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
constructive
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
what
is
--
where
is
the
page
that
it
says
that
the
plaintiff
had
actual,
as
opposed
to
imputed,
knowledge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
understand
what
the
lawyer
reading
the
ticket
has
to
do
with
this
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
true,
is
it?
in
the
english
language,
it's
not
true?
i
mean,
that's
why
i
was
giving
you
some
examples.
i
don't
know;
maybe
there's
some
special
legal
language
somewhere
written
in
blackstone,
or
maybe
it's
lord
coke,
i
don't
know,
that
says
when
you
use
the
word
"mistake"
don't
use
it
in
english,
use
--
use
it
in
italian.
0
[laugshter.]
but
i
mean,
if
we're
going
to
use
it
in
english,
there
--
it's
not
hard
to
find
instances
where
a
person
would
know,
but
he'd
still
make
a
mistake.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there's
even
a
fortiori--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
he
doesn't
know,
even
if
he
should.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
that
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
possible
reason
is
there
that
somebody
who
is
hurt
on
a
ship
and
has
a
lawyer,
and
she
has
a
broken
leg,
and
she'd
like
to
get
recovery,
would
deliberately
sue
the
wrong
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
such
a
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
just
saying,
did
he
do
it
by
mistake?
if
you
were
representing
this
person,
would
you
want
to
sue
the
company
that
could
give
you
some
money
if
they
are
liable?
or
would
you
rather
sue
the
bank
of
america
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
want
to
ask
you
about
that,
because
in
your
brief
you
refer
in
your
footnote
on
page
6
to
requirements
of
the
federal
government
44101-44103.
so
i
looked
those
up.
i
discovered
that
44103
says
that
it
is
a
requirement,
and
you
say
you
follow
these
requirements,
that
you
shall
establish
under
regulations
of
the
fmc
financial
responsibility.
and
those
regulations
tell
you
that,
at
least
as
best
i
could
read
them,
that
you
must
furnish
a
written
designation
of
a
person
in
the
united
states
as
a
legal
agent
for
service
of
process,
and
they
are
referring
to
instances
in
which
somebody
on
a
ship
suffered
an
accident.
so
since
you
say
that
you
are
complying
with
that,
i
would
like
to
know
the
name
and
address
of
that
person
in
the
united
states
for
whom
you
must
send
legal
process,
because
if
obviously
that
had
been
on
the
ticket,
that
is
precisely
the
man
to
whom
this
plaintiff
would
have
sent
the
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
were
you
correct
when
you
said
in
your
--
in
your
brief
that
this
company
which
you
represent
does
comply
with
44103?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
relevant,
i
think,
because
it
adds
to
the
confusion
if
they
are
under
a
legal
requirement
to
have
a
service
--
an
agent
to
receive
service,
and
then
they
not
only
don't
do
it,
but
they
don't
have
it
printed
on
the
ticket.
and
they
get
everybody
mixed
up
by
having
the
same
name
in
english,
or
a
very
similar
one,
and
announcing
someone
you're
supposed
to
serve,
and
then
it
turns
out
to
be
not
that
person
you're
supposed
to
serve.
it's
a
mysterious
person
that
you
can't
find.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
odd.
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
explanation
is
of
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
might
be
tangential,
but
is
there
a
reason
to
suggest
the
federal
maritime
commission
look
into
this?
because
i
read
the
regs.
i
don't
understand
quite
what's
going
on,
because
it
seems
to
me
they
have
a
rule
that
is
designed
to
prevent
this
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
true,
what
i'm
suggesting
or
not?
you
know
the
area
better.
