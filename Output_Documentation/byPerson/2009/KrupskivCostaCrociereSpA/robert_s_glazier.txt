mr.
robert
s.
glazier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are,
we
suggest,
two
issues
before
the
court:
the
first
is
the
legal
question
of
whether
a
plaintiff's
knowledge
about
the
identity
of
the
proper
party
can
preclude
a
finding
that
there
was
a
mistake
concerning
the
identity
of
the
proper
party.
that,
we
suggest,
is
in
some
ways
the
easier
issue,
because
there
are
--
there's
abundant
authority
from
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
and
from
this
court
in
nelson
v.
adams
usa,
where
the
court
said
the
rule
requires
a
mistake.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
mistake.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
correct.
and--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--yes.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
what
the
facts
are
here,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--you
know--
[laughter]
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
there
is
nothing
that
you
did
not
know.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
i
think--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--where
--
in
three
different
times
the
plaintiff
was
informed
of
the
facts.
but
let
me
say
on
the--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
circuit
court
refers
--
talks
about
imputed
knowledge.
we
disavow
that.
there
was
no
need
for
imputed
knowledge
in
this
case.
what
imputes
knowledge
is
someone
who
does
not
have
knowledge.
courts
and
lawyers
make
that
up.
if
you
don't
have
knowledge--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--there
are--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--they
are
--
they're
separate
corporations.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
they
are
separate
corporations.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
says--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--there
is
a
finding--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
finding
on
page
19a
of
the
district
court
opinion
says--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--19a
of
the
cert
petition
says
"her
failure
to
timely
naming
costa
crociere,
s.
p.
a.
as
defendant.
"
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
no.
no,
the
district
court
did
not
impute
knowledge,
and
this
is
an
important
point.
the
circuit
court
imputed
knowledge,
and--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--19a
--
it's
not
precisely
it,
but
it
says,
"her
failure
to
timely
named
costa
crociere
as
defendant
was
not
the
result
of
a
mistake.
"
it
does
not
specifically
say--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
the
best
i
can
do
is
the
conclusion
that
there
is
not
a
mistake.
but
i
--
i
need
to--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--i'd
like
to--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
--
there
--
there
is
not
that
sentence--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--in
the
opinion.
what
there
is,
is
the
plaintiff
made
a
conscious
choice.
the
facts
of
the
case
are,
first
of
all,
before
the
lawsuit
is
filed
the
plaintiff
has
the
ticket.
there
is
no
doubt,
no
doubt
whatsoever,
that
the
plaintiff
or
her
attorney
read--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--there
are
three
different
pieces
of
evidence.
the
first
is
the
ticket.
the
ticket
defines
carrier
as
costa
crociere.
it
is
the
only
entity
stated
by
name--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--it
lists
one
entity
by
name,
costa
crociere,
and
lists
others
by
role.
now,
there
may
be
some
dispute
over
whether--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
one
might
argue
that
there
might
be
a
number
of
different
entities
that
might
be
a
carrier,
but
there
is
only
one
entity
which
is
clearly
the
carrier,
indisputably
a
carrier--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--costa
crociere
is,
i
believe,
one
level
removed
an
owner
of
costa
cruise
lines.
costa
crociere
operates
around
the
world.
they
have
different
companies
that
operate
as
sales
and
marketing
agents
in
different
regions--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--no.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
costa
crociere
is
parent,
and
i
believe
there's
a
corporation
below
them,
and
then
that
corporation
owns
costa
cruise
lines.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
there
might
be
more
than
one
carrier,
but
there
is
one
carrier
identified
by
name.
it
is
the
first
--
it
is
the
first
person
listed.
costa
crociere
is
the
carrier.
i
--
i
suggest
that
if
one
reads
the
first
page
of
the
ticket,
one
might
have
questions
about
whether
there
might
be
some
other
entities
that
are
carriers,
but
there
is
simply
no
doubt
that
costa
crociere
is
the
carrier.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
now,
there
is
no--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--yes.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
what
--
what
--
the
relationship
between
the
parties
was
governed
by
the
ticket.
the
ticket
says,
for
example,
the
claim
against
the
carrier
has
to
be
filed
within
the
southern
district
of
florida.
this
claim
was
filed
in
southern
district
of
florida,
but
they
did
not
sue
the
carrier
as
identified
on
the
ticket.
and
the
question
is
was
there
a
mistake
concerning
the
identity
of
the
proper
party--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--we
--
we
believe
that
the
ticket
is
clear,
and
that
governs.
but
even
if
one
would
disagree
with
that,
then
we
move
forward.
if
there
were
any
confusion,
there's
an
answer
filed.
costa
cruise
lines
is
sued.
costa
cruise
lines
denies
that
it
can
be
held
liable,
says
it
wasn't
the
carrier,
it
wasn't--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
answer
is
filed,
but
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
knew
or
should
have
known
that
there
--
it
--
it
would
have
been
sued
but
for
a
mistake,
the
inquiry
there
is
not
within
the
limitations
period.
it
was
until
the
1991
amendment,
which
followed
the
schiavone
case.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
the
measuring
period.
it
was
before
the
1991
amendment.
now,
what
happened
here
is
the
answer
is
filed,
which
makes
clear
the
defendant
--
the
defendant
costa
cruise
lines
denies
it
was
involved
with
the
ownership,
operation,
or
management.
that's
joint
appendix
30.
joint
appendix--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--it
was
not
raised
in
the
--
in
the
defense
--
it
was
not
raised
as
defense
in
the
answer.
it
--
it
was
not.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
it
was
raised
10
weeks
later
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
was
still
within
the
rule
4(m)
period,
and
that
is
the
crucial
period.
if
upon
reading
the
answer,
which
says
the--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
the
rule
4(m)
period
is
awfully
important
because
rule
15(c)
turns
on,
since
1991,
on
the
rule
(4)(m)
period.
if
during
the
rule
4(m)
service
period,
the
--
it
became
clear
to
costa
crociere
that
it
was
an
intended
defendant,
that
it
would
have
been
sued
but
for
a
mistake,
then
the
complaint
against
costa
crociere
would
relate
back,
even
though
it
was
not
timely
filed.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
well--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
answer,
we
submit,
is
no.
when
they
filed
the
complaint,
the
complaint
indicated
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all,
they
were
suing
costa
cruise
lines,
but
they
had
read
--
the
complaint
made
clear
that
they
had
read
the
ticket.
they
specifically
relied
on
the
venue
provision
of
the
ticket.
so
we
knew
that
they
had
read
the
ticket,
which
clearly
identifies
costa
crociere
as
being
the
carrier,
yet
they
still--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
--
which
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
it's
docket
entry
19.
the
affidavit
which
is
--
was
filed
with
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
in
the
--
the
joint
appendix
at
joint
appendix
33.
and
the
motion
--
the
answer
made
clear
that
costa
crociere
is
the
carrier
which
could
be
liable,
not
costa
cruise
lines--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--but
there
was
no
change.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
the--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--if
what--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--on
the
cover,
the
italian
name
is
not
used.
the
ticketing
agent's
name--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--is
costa
cruise
lines.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
if
one
were
to
not
read
the
ticket,
which
on
page
1--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--we
know
--
if
this
were
a
question
of
uncertainty
whether
the
lawyer
read
the
ticket,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
we
know
that
the
lawyer
read
the
ticket.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
well--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
principle
is
if
one
knows
what
the
true
facts
are
--
if
one
knows
what
the
true
facts
are
and
proceeds
in
any
event,
then
there's
no
mistake
concerning
the--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--we
have--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--what
we
have
up
front
is
the
--
the
ticket.
if
we
move
past
that,
it's
sort
of
a
test
case.
all
right,
did
this
plaintiff
really
not--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
plaintiff--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
looked
at
the
web
site
and
chose
a
united
states
corporation
instead
of--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
if
it
were
--
if
i
had
to
sue
costa
crociere
through
the
hague
convention
in
genoa,
maybe
a
lawyer--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--i
cannot
answer
the
question
now.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
my
understanding
is
the
answer
is
yes,
but
i
cannot
address
the
specific
question.
i
submit--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--but
the
question,
though--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
the
question
is
not
a
more
generalized
blame
explanation,
but
under
the
rule,
the
language
of
the
rule,
whether
costa
crociere
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
action
would
have
been
brought
against
it
but
for
a
mistake
concerning
the
proper
party's
identity.
and
the
most
problematic
case
--
part
of
the
case
for
the
plaintiff
is
why,
when
they
were
told
in
the
answer
that
they
had
not
sued
the
proper
party,
that
costa
cruise
lines
was
not
the
carrier,
was
not
the
operator,
but
costa
crociere
is,
why
did
the
plaintiff
not
do
anything?
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
but
if
--
if,
during
the
120-day
period
--
you
know,
the
rule
15(c)
happens
to
rely
upon
the
measuring
point,
but
service
is
not
the
crucial
point.
within
that
120-day
period,
if
the
plaintiff
had
done
anything,
anything
at
all,
to
indicate
that
she
had
not
sued
costa
crociere
because
of
a
mistake,
then
the
complaint
would
have
related
back,
a
very
easy
case--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--yes.
yes,
we
did
not
file
the
answer.
they
filed
the
lawsuit
on
the
eve
of
the--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--if--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--we
do
not
rely
at
all
upon
imputed
knowledge.
the
court
granted
review,
but
we
don't
think
there
is
imputed
knowledge
here.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
the
rule
contemplates
by
its
structure
that
the
mistake
will
be
the
cause
of
the
reason
why
the
--
the
plaintiff
did
not
sue
the
parties.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
we--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--and
then--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--the
most
powerful
evidence
is
simply
when
they
were
informed
of
the
claimed
mistake,
they
did
nothing
for
95
days
to
indicate
in
any
manner
whatsoever
that
it
was
a
mistake.
they
had--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
this
--
whether
something
is
a
mistake
ultimately
is
a
factual
issue.
there's
a
legal
question
of
whether
a
plaintiff's
knowledge
of
the
identity
of
a
proper
party
can
preclude
a
finding
of
mistake.
but
once
we
get
past
that--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
delay
in
moving
to
amend
via
15(a).
but
15(c)
requires
the
judge
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
mistake.
and
here,
in
essence,
we
have
a
test
case:
well,
the
plaintiff
is
claiming
that
the
reason
why
she
did
not
sue
costa
crociere--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--yes,
i
believe
there
is.
the
complaint
specifically
makes
clear
that
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
read
the
ticket.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
the
complaint
certainly
does
not
say
that.
what--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--it
says
that
the--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--that
--
it's
not
an
accurate
statement
of
fact.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
right.
and
in
the
paragraph
before,
venue
is
proper
in
broward
county;
defendant's
passenger
ticket
contains
a
forum
selection.
so
we
know
when
costa
--
costa
cruise
lines,
or
costa
crociere
learns
of
this,
we
know
that
the
plaintiff
decided--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--no.
no,
because
we're
--
because
we're
not
disputing--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--we're
not
--
we
are
not
disputing
the
notice
issue.
what
--
what
is
clear
is
they
have
read
the
ticket,
and
despite
that--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--they
have
decided
to
sue
costa
cruise
lines.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
no.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
we
don't
think
so.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
but,
again,
if
we
move
past--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
there's
nothing
in
--
just
the
point--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--there's
nothing
in
the
rule
--
the
ticket
and
the
complaint
--
there's
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
that
only
events
up
to
point
of
the
running
of
the
limitations
period
or
the
service
of
the
answer
are
relevant.
it
is
throughout
the
certain
--
within
the
period--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--well,
the
district
court,
which
is
serving
as
the
fact-finder
there,
looked
at
all
the
evidence.
and
the
powerful
evidence
is
the
service
of
the
answer,
which
identifies
the
party--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
i
don't
know
the
answer
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
i
--
your
honor
--
clearly,
as
you
said,
costa
crociere
is
the
vessel
operator.
the
ticket
makes
it
clear
on
the
next
page,
the
very
next
page--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--here,
you
only
have
to
read
one.
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
well,
this
is--
mr.
robert
s.
glazier
--it's
--
it's
on
the
cover.
the
ticketing
agent
here,
costa
cruise
lines,
adds
the
cover.
the
first
page
of
the
provisions
say
costa
crociere
is
the
--
is
the
vessel
operator.
but,
again,
if
one
looks
at
the
answer,
there's
no
response.
no
response,
and
then
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
still
nothing.
if
the
plaintiff
had
merely
said
in
an
e-mail
or
a
phone
call,
hey,
i
made
a
mistake,
then
it
would
be
clear.
an
easy
case.
but
they
did
not
act
despite
being
informed.
despite
being
informed
in
the
answer
of
the
identity
of
the
proper
party
and
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
trial
court,
serving
as
the
trier
of
fact
here
on
this
issue,
