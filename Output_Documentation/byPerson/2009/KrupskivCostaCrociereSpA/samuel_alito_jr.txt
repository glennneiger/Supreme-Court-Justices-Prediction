justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
does
that
even
matter?
i'm
not
really
sure
i'm
following
this
argument.
let's
say
that
the
answer
was
filed
during
the
limitations
period,
and
the
lawyer
--
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
is
a
solo
practitioner,
and
he
or
she
is
out
of
the
office
because
the
lawyer's
on
a
cruise--
[laughter]
--and
doesn't
come
back
for
2
weeks.
and
by
that
time,
the
limitations
period
has
run.
it's
still
a
mistake.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
do
you
see
in
--
the
question
on
which
cert
was
granted
has
to
do
with
imputed
knowledge.
where
do
you
see
in
the
text
of
this
rule
anything
that
picks
up
the
concept
of
either
imputed
knowledge
or
actual
knowledge?
it
just
talks
about
a
mistake.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
where
--
just
--
where
do
you
--
where
in
the
rule
is
there
anything
that
relates
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
mistake?
what
if
it
is
the
most
foolish,
negligent
mistake
you
can
possibly
imagine?
is
it
not
still
a
mistake?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
evidence
from
which
the
absence
of
a
mistake
might
be
inferred.
i
agree
with
that,
but
that
doesn't
establish
that
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
a
mistake.
