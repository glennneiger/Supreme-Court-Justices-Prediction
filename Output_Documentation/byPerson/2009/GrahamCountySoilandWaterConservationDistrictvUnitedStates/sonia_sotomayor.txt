how
will
that
happen?
meaning,
how
will
they
know,
a,
that
the
investigation
is
occurring;
and
second,
what
can
they
do
under
federal
or
state
law
to
require
the
disclose
of
ongoing
investigative
materials?
i
don't
know
--
mind
you,
i
haven't
studied
them
--
but
the
ones
that
i
am
familiar
with
never
permit
the
public
--
none
of
the
freedom
of
information
act-type
legislation,
never
permit
the
disclosure
of
ongoing
investigative
material.
so
i
am
a
little
bit
confused
by
how
that
would
happen.

but
congress
obviously
wanted
more
than
that,
because
if
congress's
intent
was
the
one
that
you
are
announcing
then
it
should
have
just
permitted
original
sources
to
sue.
but
that's
not
the
choice
it
made.
it
broadened
the
scope
of
qui
tam
actions
to
include
more
sources
or
more
reward
for
individuals
who
don't
have
original
information.
justice

but
why
can't
it
--
why
can't
it
protect
itself
if
these
reports
are
in
its
possession?
how
are
they
any
more
in
the
--
or
less
in
the
government's
possession
than
articles
in
the
news
media,
than
state,
criminal,
civil,
and
administrative
hearings?
you,
yourself,
make
it
very
clear
that
the
government
--
it
isn't
keeping
track
of
all
of
those
other
sources.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
argument
suggesting
that
the
court
didn't
even
need
to
reach
this
issue,
even
assuming
that
the
state
administrative
reports
are
included
in
the
bar?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
aren't
you
arguing
that
what
was
in
this
audit
report
wasn't
sufficient
to
show
the
fraud?
that's
not
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
which
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
way?
all
it
said
was
that
this
person
wasn't
chosen
by
bidding.
but
aren't
there
situations
in
which
non-bids
are
permitted?
