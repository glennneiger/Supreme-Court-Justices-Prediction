mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
think
the
discussion
this
morning
illustrates,
the
federal
nature
of
the
second
category,
the
phrase
that
is
directly
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
self-evident
from
the
text.
the
terms
congressional
and
gao
are
federal
and
under
the
doctrine
or
canon
of
construction
noscitur
a
sociis--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
want
to
start
by
making
clear
that
we
disagree
that
that's
a
better
interpretation
of
the
first
clause,
but
i
will
take
it
as
the
premise.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it
--
it
may
indeed
be
harder
to
do
that.
we
think
that
it
is
warranted
in
light
of
the
policy
that
motivated
congress
and
in
light
of
other
references
to
federal
administrative,
civil
and
criminal
hearings
in
the
statute.
but
even
if
those
reasons
which
we
think
justify
limiting
the
first
category
to
federal
proceedings
--
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
that,
that
would
not
justify
disregarding
the
clear
indications
of
the
federal
limitations
on
the
second
clause.
and
there
is
no
policy--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
that
again,
as
justice
alito's
question
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
argument
illustrated,
the
literal
language
of
the
word
administrative
would
encompass
hearings
conducted
by
private
hospitals
or
universities
as
well.
now
petitioner
es
hewed
that
interpretation--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
governmental
in
a
particular
nature,
of
a
particular
nature,
the
federal
government.
as
is
the
court's
decision
in
cook
county
made
clear,
municipal
governmental
entities
are
with
respect
to
the
false
claims
act
the
same
as
private
corporations.
the
--
the
court
recognized
that
municipalities
are
the
recipients
of
many
federal
dollars.
in
that
case
the
local
governmental
entity
whose
conduct
is
at
issue
was
a
county
hospital.
and
--
and
county
hospitals
receive
funds
under
the
same
programs
that
private
hospitals--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
relevant
context.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no,
your
honor,
it
is
--
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that
it
was
federal
proceedings
that
congress
had
in
mind.
and
--
and
if
you
would
take--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--if
you
would
look
on
page
19
of
the--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i'm
--
that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
we
have
the
--
the
committee
report
and
the
bill
that
was
recorded
by
the
house
which
states
specifically
at
that
point,
the
public
disclosure
bar
referenced
information
which
the
government,
capital
g,
disclosed
the
basis
of
allegations
in
a
prior
administrative
civil
proceeding.
that
was
the
house.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
excuse
me?
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
as
we
note,
your
honor,
the
statute
uses
the
term
"government"
with
a
capital
g
throughout
to
refer
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
excuse
me?
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
congressional
--
the
--
the
term
congressional
is
frequently
used
without
a
capital,
but
state
legislatures
are
not
referred
to
as
congresses.
and
that
is
one
of
the
anomalies
that
petitioners
simply
cannot
explain:
why
congress
would
have
thought
that
an
administrative
report
issued
by
a
local
school
board
should
give
rise
to
the
bar,
but
a
report
or
a
hearing
conducted
by
a
state
legislature
would
not.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well
--
well,
your
honor,
it
is
of
course
a
--
a
truism,
that
--
that
programs
are
administered
by
the
executive
branch
more
than
the
legislative
branch,
but
that
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
have
meant
to
exclude,
if
those
state
legislatures
did
conduct
a
hearing
with
respect
to
fraud
by
the
state,
exclude
that
as
a
public
disclosure.
the
reason
that
congress
didn't
include
state
legislative
reports
is
because
it
didn't
include
state
reports
at
all.
it
was--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
more
likely
as
--
as
the
development
and
progress
of
the
clause
reflects,
that
congress
was
focused
on
what
does
the
government
know
and
what
does
the
disclosure
show
about
the
whether
the
government
is
already
or
is
likely
to
focus
on
the
fraud.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
there
--
i
--
there
are
currently
under
consideration
bills
or,
and
as
i
understand
it,
they
are
not,
there
are
other
bills
that
are
in
contemplation
that
would
revise
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
--
but
would
not
necessarily
focus
on
this.
there
are
a
number
of
other
issues
connected--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
--
i
don't
know.
but
of
course--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
--
i
don't
believe
that
as
of
yet
the
department
has
taken
a
specific
position
on
--
on
the
legislation
that
is
contemplated
in
this
particular
ambiguity.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the
senate--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
context
is
--
is
federal.
references
to
states
in
connection
with
the
act
that
congress
has
thought
about
it
are
treating
states
like
other
private
qui
tam
relators.
they
petitioner
referred
to
the
dean
case,
and,
in
fact,
that
was
something
that
the
--
the
legislative
history
refers
to,
but
what
was
offensive
about
the
decision
in
the
dean
case
was
that
wisconsin
had
been
the
original
source
of
the
information,
but
had
been
barred
because
it
had
provided
that
information
to
the
government.
and,
under
the
government
knowledge
bar,
they
had
been
precluded,
so
--
so
wisconsin
would
have
been
taken
care
of
under
the
original
source
provision,
but
it
doesn't
reflect
a
view
that
states
have
a
particular
distinctive
role.
in
fact,
as
this
court's
decision
in
cook
county
reflects,
municipalities
are
treated
just
like
any
private
corporation
for
purposes
of
the
act.
they
can
be
defendants,
they
could
be
plaintiffs,
qui
tam
relators,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
construe
the
statute
in
a
way
that
would
allow
a
local
government,
technically,
to
shield
itself
from
qui
tam
suits
by
disclosing
the
facts
that
would
be
the
underlying
information
support
of
the
fraud
claim
in,
perhaps,
a
report
that
was
intended
to
--
to
whitewash
the
situation--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that,
in
order
to
be
a
public
disclosure
--
the
second
category
at
the
very
least
--
all
that
needs
to
have
happened
is
that
information
be
disclosed
to
--
to
one
additional
person.
that
--
and
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
when
we
are
talking
about
disclosures
of
the
government
--
federal
government's
own
reports
because,
if
the
federal
government
is
already
investigating
and
pursuing
the
fraud,
one
other
person
that
finds
out
about
it
and
then
files
a
qui
tam
action
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
own
effort
is
precisely
the
situation
that
congress
sought
to
preclude.
but
it
doesn't
make
any
senses
when
we
are
talking
about
a
disclosure
to
an
individual
by
a
state
or
local--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
we
think
that
the
--
the
disclosures
--
the
allegations
in
the
types
of
reports,
audits,
investigations,
that
are
referenced
in
the
clause
are
the
type
that
would
evidence
that
the
government
is
pursuing
them.
and
--
but
where
a
state
--
perhaps
a
local
school
board
discloses
facts
that
might
give
rise
to
an
allegation
of
fraud
in
a
hearing
where
there
was
only
one
or
two
members
of
the
public
in
attendance,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
that
information
is
going
to
be
brought
to
the
federal
government's
attention.
the
purpose
of
the
bar
is
to
balance
--
congress
was
seeking
to
balance
two
rules.
one
is
to
encourage
qui
tam
relators
to
bring
information
and
bring
suit
where
the
information
was
unlikely
to
be
something
that
the
government
--
federal
government
was
focusing
on.
where
the
federal
government
was
able
to
protect
itself
and
bring
this
suit
on
its
own,
then
there's
no
reason
for
the
federal
government
to
have
to
share
its
recovery.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
petitioners'
reference
to
this
audit
being
in
the
possession
of
the
government
--
it's
happenstance
that
this
particular
report,
the
crisp
&
hughes
report,
was
sent
to
the
federal
government
official.
but
the
vast
majority
of
state
and
local
governmental
investigations,
audits,
and
reports,
are
not
going
to
be
given
to
the
federal
government,
and
even
though
they
are
--
they
cite
the
single
audit
act,
which
is
only
a
very
narrow
subset
of
audits
that
states
or
local
governments
perform
--
do
not
actually
disclose
the
allegations
of
the
fraud.
in
order
to
get
to
the
actual
information
of
the
fraud,
the
--
first
of
all,
it
would
have
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
relevant
federal
agency.
usually,
the
cognizant
agency
is
the
one
that
has
the
most
money
at
stake,
but
the
fraud
may
have
to
do
with
a
different
federal
program,
so
it
has
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
program
whose
interests
are
actually
at
stake.
they
have
to
go
beyond
the
report
that
is
--
that
is
publicly
available
in
the
clearinghouse
website,
which
tells
you
virtually
nothing,
to
an
underlying
report
which
is
itself,
generally,
fairly
vague,
and
all
petitioners
say
is
that
the
working
papers
of
the
auditor
are
available
to
the
government,
not
even
in
the
government's
possession,
they
are
available
to
the
government
if
it
requests
it.
the
government
has
to
drill
down
many
levels
before
it
necessarily
is
going
to
know
about
that
fraud.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no
--
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no
--
again,
this
report
here
did
have
information
that
was
indicative
of
fraud,
and
this
report--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--excuse
me?
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
there
--
there
were
multiple
allegations.
one
of
the
allegations
underlying
the
relator's
claim
is
that
the
government
--
the
county
certified
that
certain
procedures
were
followed
that
would
have
included
a
requirement
that
it
be
bid
out,
and
that
it
was
not.
another
was
that
certain
work
was
paid
for
or
billed
for,
but
wasn't
performed
or
was
not
performed
well,
so
there
were
--
there
were
different
allegations,
and
where
that
would
be
disclosed
to
a
single
person,
that
would
constitute
a
public
disclosure,
at
least
with
respect
to
federal--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--but
only
if
we--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--and
what
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
federal
government
is
ever
going
to
learn
of
the
fraud.
