justice

but
under
your
proposal
a
state
that
itself
is
guilty
of
fraud
can,
in
effect,
immunize
--
if
not
immunize
itself,
at
least
render
the
information
unusable
by
conducting
a
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
a
--
would
it
be
a
civil
hearing?
a
deposition
--
you
would
consider
a
deposition
to
be
a
civil
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
provision
would
it
come
under?
justice
antonin
scalia
documents
are
--
documents
are
a
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
meant
more
than
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
argument
that
doesn't
go
very
far
with
me.
i
mean,
"hearing"
means
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
there
would
be
a
good
lawsuit
as
to
whether
gao
report.
i
think
that's
a
lawsuit.
i
don't
think
it's
at
all
as
clear
as
you
suggest.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
that
argument
does
not
scare
the
government.
i
think
the
government
would
like
to
read
"administrative
hearing"
in
the
first
--
in
the
first
phrase
as
being
limited
to
federal
administrative
hearing
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
on
--
on
the
basis
of
the
first,
the
first
phrase
rather
than
the
second?
justice
antonin
scalia
stars
and
stripes,
maybe.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
stop
calling
them
clauses.
they
are
really
phrases.
justice
antonin
scalia
phrases.
justice
antonin
scalia
part
of
the
random
nature
of
the
whole
provision,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
should
we
read
the
second
category
back
to
alter
the
meaning
of
the
first,
rather
than
reading
the
first
phrase
forward
to
alter
the
meaning
of
the
second?
it
--
it
is
absolutely
clear
when
you
read
this,
"in
a
criminal,
civil,
or
administrative
hearing.
"
there
is
no
limitation
to
federal
on
that.
and
you
acknowledge
that
the
criminal
and
civil
apply
to
--
to
state
civil
and
criminal
proceedings,
right?
so
when
you
read
that
phrase,
"administrative"
simply
means,
obviously
means
state
administrative.
now,
why
shouldn't
i
read
that
forward
and
say,
well,
since
it
means
state
there,
it
must
mean
state
in
the
next
one,
in
a
congressional,
administrative,
or
gao
report.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
just
as
to
administrative.
don't
you
acknowledge
that
the
criminal
and
civil
apply
to
state
criminal
and
civil?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
the
whole
thing
to
be
just
federal?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
category?
justice
antonin
scalia
news
media,
they
are
likely
to
be
keeping
track
of
all
local
newspapers
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
they
could
have
said
"national
news
media".
it
didn't
say
"national
news
media".
it
said
"news
media".
justice
antonin
scalia
it
includes
a
local
radio
station,
a
local
community
newspaper,
right?
all
of
that
is
included.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet,
state
proceedings,
which
are
excluded,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
state
supreme
court
cases
and
so
forth.
it
seems
strange
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
show
that
it
makes
sense.
it
just
shows
that
congress
wasn't
thinking
clearly.
there's
as
difference
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
decision
of
ours
do
you
think
would
prompt
congress
to
go
back
and
do
this
right?
i
mean,
do
you
think
that
finding
the
way
the
government
wants
us
to
find
will
produce
a
revision
of
this
really
terrible
text
so
that
it
makes
sense;
or
do
you
think
that
finding
for
the
other
side,
giving
the
government
some
incentive
to
get
this
fixed,
would
likely
produce
a
proper
amendment?
what
do
you
think?
i
think
the
latter,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
be
more
specific
when
you
say
that
congress
had
in
mind?
just
so
i
know
what
you
are
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
committee
that
reported
the
bill.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
both
houses
or
just
one
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
justice
department
seeking
to
get
this
--
this
piece
of
--
of
statutory
text
clarified?
i
mean,
you
do
have
some
operation
over
there
that
proposes
to
congress
amendments
of
those
provisions
that
are
not
working
out
well.
is
there
--
is
there
any
effort
to
get
this
clarified?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
make
it
worse?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
attorney
general
can
always
bring
suit,
right?
i
mean,
all
we
are
arguing
about
is
whether
this
information
that
is
in
the
in
the
state
and
local
thing
could
be
the
basis
of
a
qui
tam
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
government
finds
out
about
it,
the
attorney
general
could
always
bring
suit,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
we
say
everybody's
working
in
a
certain
context,
how
--
how
many
people
is
everybody?
what
percentage
of
the
house
and
of
the
senate
were
involved
in
these
committees
that
were
drafting
these
bills
and
that
issued
the
committee
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
your
claim
is
--
is
that
the
government
--
the
federal
government
is
not
the
only
person
harmed?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore
--
you
know,
we
should
listen
to
them,
so
long
as
they
don't
--
they
want
to
come
out
this
way,
you
are
saying
the
state
and
local
governments--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
significantly
harmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
the
federal
government
doesn't
care
about,
right?
