mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
word
"administrative"
as
used
in
the
public
disclosure
bar
of
the
false
claims
act
includes
state
audits
and
reports
or
is
limited
to
federal
sources.
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
a
relator
can
simply
copy
a
state
report
or
a
state
criminal
indictment
and
then
proceed
with
a
qui
tam
action,
there
will
be
a
proliferation
of
opportunistic
qui
tam
actions
brought
under
this
statute.
such
construction
of
the
statute
would
have
a
devastating
effect
upon
states,
local
governments,
and
the
federal
fisc.
much
of
the
work
of
state
government
involves
cooperative
federal
and
state
programs.
states
have
been
an
effective
partner
in
fighting
against
fraud
and
abuse
with
respect
to
those
programs.
for
example,
many
states
have
turned
to
computerized
software
to
identify
irregularities
in
connection
with
medicaid
billings.
california
has
implemented
a
process
of
analyzing
both
its
medicare
and
its
medicaid
databases
in
order
to
identify
doctors
who
bill
in
excess
of
24
hours
in
a
given
day.
under
the
decision
below,
that
investigatory
work
can
simply
be
copied
by
a
qui
tam
plaintiff
and
an
action
brought
based
upon
that
public
report.
the
result
is--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the
government
certainly
argues
that
it
would
result
in
state
and
local
governments
immunizing
themselves
from
qui
tam
liability.
with
respect
to
states,
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
expressly
includes
reports
of
the
state
government.
states,
of
course,
are
not
liable
under
the
qui
tam
provisions,
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
vermont
department
of
natural
resources
v.
united
states
ex
rel.
stevens.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes
--
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
--
even
if
there
is
a
state
report
that
a
--
that
a
--
is
in
the
public
domain,
a
local
government
could
still
be
sued
under
that
document,
if
--
in
spite
of
that
document,
by
either
the
united
states
or
a
qui
tam
plaintiff
that
stands
as
an
original
source.
so--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
congress
looked
at
the
pre-1986
public
disclosure
bar,
the
provisions
that
existed
between
1943
and
1986,
and
during
that
time
frame
an
action,
a
qui
tam
action,
would
be
barred
if
it
was
based
upon
information
that
was
available
to
the
--
the
federal
government.
congress
decided
that
that
cut
off
too
many
qui
tam
actions,
and
as
a
result
it
reached
a
compromise.
many
members
of
congress
wanted
to
totally
eliminate
the
government
knowledge
bar.
on
the
other
hand,
the
united
states
department
of
justice
at
the
time
was
arguing
that
the
existing
bar
should
remain
in
effect
as
a
result
of
abusive
and
frivolous
qui
tam
actions
and
their
concern
with
respect
to
that.
so
a
compromise
was
reached
in
which
the
bar
was
completely
changed.
it
was
changed
to
allow
for
a
--
for
an
original
source
to
bring
the
qui
tam
action,
essentially
a
relief
valve
that
addressed
congress's
concerns
with
respect
to
cases
such
as
united
states
ex
rel.
wisconsin
v.
dean.
it
also
in
the
1986
amendments
set
out
specific
sources
of
information
and
directly
identified
the
type
of
public
information
that
a
qui
tam
action
can
be
based
upon.
that
list,
of
course,
includes
many
sources
that
might
or
might
not
be
readily
available
to
the
united
states
government.
for
example,
it
includes
reports
by
a
news
media.
a
--
an
obscure
article
in
a
weekly
publication
of
limited
circulation
does
not
realistically
put
the
government
on
notice
of
a
particular
fraud.
the
same
can
be
true
--
said
with
regard
to
an
action
filed
in
federal
court,
a
private
action
between
civil
litigants
based
upon
diversity
jurisdiction.
if
that
--
if
there
is
a
summary
judgment
motion
filed
in
that
case
and
there
are
a
number
of
depositions,
one
of
which
might
indicate
fraud,
that
are
filed
in
that
summary
judgment
motion
and
the
case
settles,
that
--
there
will
never
be
--
that
summary
judgment
motion
wouldn't
be
reviewed
by
the
federal
district
court
judge.
but
still,
there
is
no
question
that
the
filing
of
that
document
with
the
federal
court
would
constitute
a
public
disclosure
under
the
first
clause
of
the
public
disclosure
bar.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
referring
to
a
deposition
that
is
actually
filed
with
the
court
in
connection
with
the
summary
judgment
motion
and
the
case
then
settles.
generally,
the
--
the
courts
have--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
the
phrase
"criminal,
civil,
or
administrative
hearing.
"
the
courts
have
consistently
read
that
word
"hearing"
as
--
as
including
all
courts'
proceedings,
not
simply
the
hearing
itself,
documents
that
are
filed
with
the
clerk's
office--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
--
if
congress
had
meant
to
limit
that
word
"hearing"
to
literally
in-person
oral
arguments
or
in-person
testimony,
it
--
the
result
would
be
that
a
criminal
indictment
could
be
copied
by
a
qui
tam
plaintiff
and
an
action
brought
based
upon
that.
that,
of
course,
was
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess.
the
--
it
is
clear
from
the
congressional
history
that
congress
wanted
to
change
that
result
by
--
so
congress
used
the
word
"hearing"
that
obviously
meant
more
than
--
than
simply--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
part
of
the
problem,
is--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
--
the
problem
is
--
is
that
congress
really
did
not
speak
very
clearly
at
all
with
respect
to
the
false
claims
act,
and
so
we're
--
we're
left
with
this
mess
of
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
congress
intended.
the
phrase--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--justice
alito,
the
petitioners
would
not
read
that
phrase
as
--
that
broadly.
when
the
congress
has
used
the
word
"administrative
hearing",
that
would
appear
to
indicate
action
by
the
government.
and,
under
any
of
the
dictionary
definitions
of
"administration",
clearly
a
state
administrative
proceeding,
a
state
administrative
report,
would
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
dictionary
definition.
we
don't
believe
the
court
needs
to
read
that
language
as
including
private
hospitals,
private
universities.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
public
disclosure
bar
uses
the
phrase
"administrative
hearing"
twice,
and
it's
referring
to
black's
law
dictionary.
it
defines
"administrative
hearing"
as,
essentially,
a
hearing
conducted
by
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
then
in
the
second
clause
it
proceeds
to
use
the
phrase
"congressional,
administrative,
government
accounting
office
hearing,
audit,
investigation,
or
report.
"
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
redundancy
based
upon
petitioner's
construction
of
the
statute.
but
congress
was
not
particularly
concerned
about
redundancy
in
the
false
claims
act.
for
example,
again
it
uses
the
phrase
"congressional,
administrative,
or
gao.
"
gao,
of
course,
is
a
body
that
reports
to
congress.
its
head
is
appointed
by
the
president.
so
under
any
definition
gao
would
either
be
congressional
or
administrative,
so
there
is
a
redundancy
there.
there's
also--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
let
me
also
point
out
that
there
is
a
redundancy
in
connection
with
the
use
of
"audit,
report,
or
investigation.
"
essentially,
congress
is
using
the
same
word
to
mean
essentially
the
same
thing
in
that
clause
as
well.
but
yes,
our
reading
does
result
in
a
redundancy
in
the
statute.
of
course,
the
government
reads
this
entire
clause
as
being
limited
to
federal
proceedings.
they
would
urge
a
redundancy
in
the
statute
as
well.
but
what's
more
important
is
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
it
will
not
read
the
same
phrase
as
having
a
different
meaning
in
the
same
sentence.
yes,
congress
has
created
a
redundancy,
but
that
is
no
more
egregious
than
the
fact
that
it
used
the
phrase
"government
accounting
office"
to
refer
to
what
was
clearly
the
general
accounting
office.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
justice
scalia.
that
is
their
argument
today.
of
course,
just
11
months
ago
in
united
states
ex
rel.
poteet
v.
medtronic,
the
government
argued
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
a
qui
tam
action
should
be
dismissed
based
upon
a
state
court
complaint.
they
convinced
the
sixth
circuit
to
accept
that
position
and
dismissed
that
complaint
on
january
14
of
this
year.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
based
upon
the
first
clause
of
the
statute.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
two
audit
reports
--
i'm
sorry,
there
are
two
reports.
the
key
one
is
the
report
that
identifies
or
asserts
that
this
work
at
issue
should
have
been
sent
out
by
bid.
that
was
prepared
by
an
accounting
firm
for
graham
county,
north
carolina,
the
same
auditor
that
was
engaged
by
the
county
to
comply
with
the
single
audit
act--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
would
have
to
go
beyond
the
record,
but
yes,
we
have
conducted
a
--
submitted
a
public
information
act
request,
and
essentially
a
week
after
the
document
was
transmitted
to
graham
county
it
was
transmitted
to
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
justice
breyer,
first
of
all,
the
government
hasn't
been
consistent.
as
we
pointed
out
in
united
states
ex
rel.
poteet,
they
have
taken
the
exact
opposite
position
with
regard
to
clause
1
in
the
first
circuit.
but
the
real
issue
here
and
what
should
concern
the
court
is
the
fact
that
there
will
be
a
tremendous
number
of
opportunistic
qui
tam
plaintiffs
that
arise.
if
someone
can
simply
go
to
an
ongoing
state
or
local
government
investigation,
copy
it,
and
bring
it--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
weight
that
should
be
given
is
to
the
partners
of
the
federal
government,
states
and
local
governments
that
are
in
the
trenches
administering
these
programs,
that
will
have
tremendous
difficulty
if
there
is
a
rash
of
qui
tam
actions
that
are
brought
that
disrupt
ongoing
medicaid
and
other
investigations.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
justice
sotomayor,
there
are
going
to
be
some
exceptions
to
many
states'
public
information
act
requests,
things
such
as
attorney-client
communications,
in
some
cases
criminal
investigations.
but
for
most
states
there
will
not
be
any
sort
of
prohibition
against
a
plaintiff's
attorney
filing
a
public
information
act
request
saying,
print
out
--
give
us
a
copy
of
all
printouts
that
show
disparities
and
irregularities
with
regard
to
medicaid
billings.
moreover,
most
states
are
--
by
law
are
required
to
receive
complaints
concerning
the
state's
medicaid
program.
those
are
generally
processed
by
the
state's
system
integrity
program.
and
those
reports
are
going
to
be
readily
available
to
public
information
act
requests.
essentially,
what
this
court
should
be
worried
about
are
state
employees
who
know
where
the
documents
can
be
located.
you
can
simply
copy
the
document,
bring
a
qui
tam
action,
and
produce
a
windfall
for
yourself,
potentially
disrupting
the
state
investigation.
and
if
congress
really
wanted
to
do
that,
if
they
wanted
to
create
this
rash
of
ill-advised
qui
tam
actions,
this
flood
that's
about
to
fall
upon
the
states,
congress
should
have
written
a
little
bit
more
clearly
before
doing
so.
it
isn't
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute
or
with
congressional
intent.
throughout
the
legislative
history
it
is
clear
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
was
to
have
access
to
true
insiders,
the
whistleblowers,
to
obtain
information
that
would
be
confidential,
that
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
--
it
added
the
original
source
provision,
and
it
identified
certainly
sources
of
information
and
said,
you
cannot
bring
an
action
based
upon
those
specific
sources.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
those
include--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
exactly.
the
government
argues
that
the
false
claims
act
is
exclusively
federal,
the
public
disclosure
bar
should
therefore
be
read
as
exclusively
federal.
but
the
existence
of
this
category
of
news
media
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
public
disclosure
bar
to
be
exclusively
federal
sources.
there
--
there
--
under
the
government's
theory
that
all
of
this
fall
--
the
entire
public
disclosure
bar
should
be
read
as
limited
to
federal
sources,
the
only
news
media
that
would
be
able
to
--
to
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
public
disclosure
bar
would
be
the
voice
of
america,
which
is
the
only
federal
news
media
currently
in
existence,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
two
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
response
is:
first,
these
clauses
--
and
there
are
three
clauses,
the
first
one
beginning
with
"in"
and
the
third
one
beginning
with
"from"
--
they
do
not
serve
different
purposes.
rather,
they
serve
to
identify
the
sources
that
congress
did
not
want
to
give
rise
to
a
qui
tam
action.
so
this
list
has
to
be
read
as
a
whole.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
throughout--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
these
three
phrases,
the
--
throughout
the
legislative
history,
the
year
and
a
half
that
the
false
claims
act
was
being
debated,
there
were
only
two
clauses
that
began
with--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--the
preposition
"in"
--
phrases.
[laughter]
--that
began
with
the
preposition
"in"
and
then
"from"
in
connection
with
"news
media".
it
was
only
on
october
3,
1986,
that
the
--
when
it
was
--
the
provision
was
finally
enacted
by
the
senate,
that
this
second
"in"
was
added
before
the
second
clause.
so,
congress
undoubtedly
did
not
intend
to
make
this
11th-hour
change
and
have
some
substantive
change
to
the
statute.
rather,
it
should
best
be
read
as
a
last-minute
insert
to
make
the
clause,
the
three
clauses
as
a
whole,
read
and
flow
much
better
than
they
did
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
if
there
has
been
a
public
disclosure--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
essentially
what
the
lower
courts
have
done
is
they
would
allowed
a
qui
tam
action
to
go
with
regard
to
a
completely
different
claim.
but
if
it
were
simply
the
fact
that
the
public
disclosure
covered
a
portion
of
the
time
period
but
not
all
of
it--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes.
yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
under
--
under
that
scenario,
if
the
qui
tam
action
is
filed
before
the
public
disclosure,
then
the
qui
tam
action
would
not
be
bourne--
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
--
as
justice
alito
pointed
out
when
he
served
on
the
third
circuit,
that
some
of
these
prepositions
are
very
awkward
indeed.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
justice
scalia.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
first
turn
to
your
comments
or
your
questions
about
legislative
history;
here,
i
think
the
legislative
history
tells
us
very
little
because
of
the
many
changes
in
the
senate
version
and
the
house
version,
and
unfortunately,
there
was
not
a
conference
committee
report,
so
we
won't
know
the
nature
of
the
compromise.
at
most,
the
legislative
history
helps
us
to
show
what
congress
was
generally
concerned
about,
and
throughout
the
original
committee,
the
senate
and
house
report,
there
is
a
concern
about
qui
tam
actions
based
upon
public
information.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
justice
breyer,
that
the
government
assumes
and
repeats
throughout
its
brief
that
the
false
claims
act
is
exclusively
federal
in
nature;
therefore,
you
read
all
of
its
terms
as
essentially
being
--
being
federal.
that,
of
course,
does
not
answer
what
congress
intended
with
the
public
disclosure
bar--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
justice
scalia,
your
point
is
well-taken,
that
this
would
only
be--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes.
continuing
with
your
--
your
question,
if
i
could,
justice
breyer,
that
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
public
disclosure
bar
should
be
exclusively
federal.
it,
of
course,
includes
news
media,
which
is
not
federal.
it
also
includes
criminal,
civil,
or
administrative
hearings.
but
moreover,
there
are
many
aspects
of
the
false
claims
act
that
are
not
exclusively
federal
in
nature.
the
very
change
that
we
are
talking
about
--
the
--
the
change
to
the
public
disclosure
bar
was
a
result
of
a
push
by
the
national
association
of
attorney
generals
to
actually
change
the
public
disclosure
bar
to
make
sure
that
states
could
bring
qui
tam
actions.
that
is
why
the
public
disclosure
bar
includes
an
original
source
provision.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
again,
that
our
concern
from
the
perspective
of
the
states
--
and
it's
a
concern
shared
by
local
governments
--
is
the
reading
that
respondents
advocate
will
produce
a
flood
of
qui
tam--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
it
does
give
rise
to
a
--
a
false
claim
will,
of
course,
give
rise
to
criminal
liability.
moreover,
it
is
a
case
dealing
with--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
is
some
older
authority
to
that
affect.
the
specific
case
--
i
apologize.
the
name
escapes
me.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
we
are
--
we
are
partners--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--the
federal
government
has,
i
think,
taken
a
very
short-sighted
view
because
these
sort
of
qui
tam
actions
will
be
very
disruptive
to
what
the
federal
government's
partners
are
actually
doing
in
the
trenches
in
administering
these
programs.
moreover,
the
federal
false
claims
act
--
it
is
clear
that
it
is
not
exclusively
federal.
when
it
was
amended
in
1986,
congress
changed
section
3732(b),
which
allowed
pendent
state
claims
to
be
brought,
so
a
state,
if
there
is
a
federal
false
claims
action,
could
intervene
to
protect
the
state's
portions
of
the
--
the
monies
that
are
at
issue.
moreover,
in
section
3733(l)(7)(a),
the
civil
investigative
demand
provisions,
congress
expressly
viewed
the
word
"administrative"
to
include,
not
only
federal
administrative
proceedings,
but
state
administrative
proceedings
as
well.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes.
they
will
be
very
enthusiastic
if
they
can
simply
take
a
state
report
showing
medicaid
fraud
and
bring
a
qui
tam
action.
that
will
be
very
disruptive
to
states
and
to
local
governments.
thank
you,
your
honor.
