in
your
view,
must
an
administrative
report
be
a
report
that
is
generated
by
some
government
unit?
could
it
be
a
report
by
the
administration
of
a
university,
for
example?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i'm
not
sure
why.
you
--
if
--
unless
"administrative"
is
informed
by
the
other
adjectives
in
that
prepositional
phrase,
"in
a
congressional,
administrative,
or
government
accounting
office.
"
presumably
gao,
"report",
it
--
unless
that
is
the
--
you
know,
unless
it's
informed
by
those
other
references,
and
that's
why
it
has
to
be
governmental,
i'm
not
sure
how
you
limit
"administrative"
to
governmental
reports.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
the
federal
government
is
focusing
on
everything
that
is
disclosed
in
every
civil
proceeding
that
occurs
in
federal
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
the
second
phrase
said
"in
a
congressional,
news
media,
or
gao
report.
"
would
you
read
"news
media"
to
be
governmental?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
the
way
it's
phrased
now?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
no.
right
now
we
have
"in
a
congressional,
administrative,
or
government
accounting
office
report.
"
and
you
say
you
have
to
read
gao>
["].
but
what
if
it
said
"in
a
congressional,
news
media,
or
government
accounting
office
report?
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
you
make
the
same
argument
with
relation
to
"news
media"?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that?
