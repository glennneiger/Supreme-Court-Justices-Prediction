justice
john
paul

--may
i
ask
this
question:
is
the
fact
that
they've
included
the
news
media
consistent
with
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
seems
to
be
a
much
more
open
source
of
information
than
you're
raising.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i,
just
one
--
one
quick
question.
i
--
i
--
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood.
do
you
draw
any
distinction
between
the
preposition
"in"
and
the
preposition
"from"?

mr.
hurt,
let
me
just
give
you
what's
really
troubling
me
about
this
case.
you
have
two
citizens
of
a
small
town.
one
of
them
goes
to
the
hearing
and
gets
all
this
information,
the
other
one
doesn't
go
to
the
hearing
and
reads
about
it
in
the
newspaper.
the
latter
is
a
permissible
plaintiff,
the
former
is
not;
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice

the
false
claims
act,
which
was
enacted
during
the
civil
war,
authorizes
not
only
the
attorney
general,
but
also
private
parties
known
as
qui
tam
relators
to
recover
from
those
who
make
false
or
fraudulent
claims
for
payment
to
the
united
states.
since
1986,
the
act
has
contained
a
provision
known
as
the
public
disclosure
bar
that
forbids
qui
tam
suits
when
the
underlying
information
has
already
entered
the
public
domain
through
certain
channels.
in
particular,
the
1986
act
bars
qui
tam
suits
based
on
allegations
disclosed
“in
a
congressional,
administrative,
or
gao
report.”
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
public
disclosure
bar
extends
not
just
to
federal
administrative
sources,
but
also
to
state
and
local
sources.
for
reasons
set
forth
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
bar
does
apply
to
nonfederal
sources
and
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
in
a
portion
of
the
patient
protection
and
affordable
care
act,
enacted
a
few
days
ago,
congress
adopted
an
amendment
to
the
false
claim
act
that
expressly
limits
the
disclosure
bar
to
federal
administrative
reports.
because
that
amendment
is
not
retroactive,
it
does
not
affect
our
decision
today.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
