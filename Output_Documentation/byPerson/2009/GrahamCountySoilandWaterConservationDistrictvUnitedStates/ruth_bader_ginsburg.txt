and
it's
also
the
original
source,
if
--
if
the
relator
is
the
original
source
of
the
information.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
argument
that
congress
wanted
to,
in
its
most
recent
provisions,
wanted
to
expand
qui
tam
availability
and
this
would
--
if
you
would
--
if
you
include
state
and
local
reports,
that
will
shrink
the
availability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
"twice",
you
mean
in
the
first
clause
that
says
"in
a
criminal,
civil,
or
administrative
hearing?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
a
redundancy
there
if
the
statute
means
what
you
say
it
does;
it
says
"administrative
hearing"
in
both
the
first
clause
and
the
second
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
particular
audit
report
we
are
talking
about,
this
is
the
audit
report
was
done
by
an
independent
accountant?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
--
is
that
audit
on
file
with
the
department
of
agriculture?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
begin
at
the
beginning,
and
that
is
with
the
first
phrase
with
the,
what
is
it,
"civil,
criminal,
administrative
hearing.
"
do
you
as
the
government
--
do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
you
have
to
insert
"federal"
there,
too?
or
does
that
phrase--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--include
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
--
suppose
it
isn't?
suppose
the
general
"civil,
criminal,
administrative"
is
read
to
mean
--
include
state.
why
shouldn't
the
second,
if
it
we
are
picking
latin
phrases,
be
read
in
pari
materia?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
what
was
the
reason
for
that
be,
given
that
there
are
so
many
joint
federal-state
grant
programs,
like
the
one
that's
involved
here?
why
wouldn't
a
state
report
be
as
much
of
a
public
disclosure
as
a
federal
report?
i
mean,
we
are
told
that
this
particular
report
was
filed
with
the
u.s.
department
of
agriculture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
audit
report
is
required
by
federal
law,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
go
back
to
the
other
latin
phrase.
if
you
begin
at
the
beginning
and
you
begin
with
a
phrase
that
you
have
no
reason
to
say
is
modified
by
federal,
"civil,
criminal
or
administrative
proceeding.
"
why
shouldn't
that
drive
the
statute,
what's
in
the
first
phrase?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
a
lot
hard
to
say
you
have
to
put
a
caret
mark
and
say
--
vidi
--
means
federal
civil,
criminal
and
administrative
hearings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
an
explanation
for
it
in
the
opposing
brief,
that
congress
in
--
what
was
it
--
1986
didn't
think
that
the
legislature
was
generating
reports,
audits,
as
distinguished
from
administrative
agencies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
that
--
that
doesn't
follow
like
the
night
the
day.
it
could
be,
as
it
was
explained,
they
didn't
include
state
legislatures
because
they
didn't
think
they
would
be
generating
relevant
material.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
the
question
was
has
the
department
of
justice,
recognizing
that
there's
a
circuit
split
this
very
question
recommended
that
congress
amend
the
statute
in
this
particular--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
think
that
the
--
when
a
--
when
state
employees
want
to
immunize
themselves
from
fraud,
they
are
going
to
say,
okay,
we
will
disclose
it
where
anybody
--
a
prosecutor
could
pick
it
up,
but
we
will
take
care
of
the
qui
tam
obligation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
lots
of
disclosures
--
there's
lots
of
disclosures
in
federal
reports
that
the
government
isn't
pursuing.
