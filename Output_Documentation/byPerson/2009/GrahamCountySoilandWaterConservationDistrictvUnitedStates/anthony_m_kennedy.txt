justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
just
as
a
practical
matter,
suppose
--
suppose
the
county
says,
you
know,
we
found
out
that
we
were
defrauded
by
this
contractor,
and
it
sues
the
contractor.
but
its
suit
doesn't
cover
really
all
of
the
damages,
only
half
of
it.
can
a
qui
tam
action
then
be
commenced
for
the
portion
that
the
county
isn't
seeking?
i
mean,
how
does
that
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
there
would
be
if
there's
a
complaint
filed
by
the
county--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--against
the
contractor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
depends
on
the
identity
of
the
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
suppose
in
their
race
to
the
courthouse,
the
qui
tam
plaintiff
files
on
monday
and
the
county
files
on
tuesday?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
very
first
question.
i
want
you
to
assume
that
in
category
1
it
means
state
or
federal.
maybe
you
disagree,
maybe
you
don't.
i
want
you
to
assume
that.
if
we
assume
that,
does
it
make
any
sense
to
confine
category
2
to
federal
only?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what's
the
practical
--
your
answer
was,
well,
that's
because
--
i
want
to
know
the
practical
rationale
for
that,
the
practical
reasons
why
that
should
make
sense.
