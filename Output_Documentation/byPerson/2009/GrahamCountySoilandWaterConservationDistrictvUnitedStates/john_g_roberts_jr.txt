justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-304,
graham
county
soil
and
water
conservation
district
v.
the
united
states,
ex
rel.
wilson.
mr.
browning.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
not
terribly
persuasive.
in
the
statute
there
are
separate
provisions,
they
talk
about
disclosures
"in
criminal,
civil
or
administrative
hearings.
"
"in
a
congressional
administrative
or
government
accounting
office
report,
or
from
the
news
media.
"
simply
because
you
want
to
limit
"administrative"
or
not
limit
"administrative"
does
not
mean
that
the
other
side's
view
requires
news
media
to
be
modified
by
"federal".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
mr.
hurt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
are
you
sure
that
--
your
argument
is
that
this
is
sandwiched
between
two
federal
descriptions?
are
you
sure
"congressional"
is
limited
to
federal
congress?
the
first
definition
in
black's
dictionary
is
"a
formal
meeting
of
delegates".
and
i
don't
know
--
maybe
i
should
--
i
don't
know
if
all
50
states
refer
to
their
legislature
by
some
term
other
than
"congress".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hallward-driemeier?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
clear
limitations,
you
really
have
only
one,
right?
i
mean
you
have
no
argument
construing
administrative
in
a
federal
way
other
than
it
is
sandwiched
between
two
other
federal--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
would
just
--
we
would
just
take
the
sections
from
your
brief
today
and
say
well
no,
you
have
got
to
read
it
in
the
context
in
which
it
appears
and
this
is
all
federal,
which
means
it's
all
governmental.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
well,
north
carolina
has
got
a
government,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
north
carolina
has
a
government,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
same
rule
for
congress?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
same
rule
for
congressional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
browning,
you
have
six
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
--
to
follow
up,
i
think
it
was
a
question
that
justice
breyer
asked
earlier.
do
you
have
any
tie-breaker
on
your
side?
i
mean,
if
we
do
decide
the
arguments
are
pretty
much
in
equipoise,
the
suggestion
was
that
the
federal
government
is
both
the
beneficiary
and
the
loser
in
the
qui
tam
actions,
from
the
sense
they
lose
a
percentage
of
recovery,
and
so
we
ought
to
let
them
strike
the
balance.
what
argument
do
you
have
on
your
side?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
same
--
that's
one
of
the
arguments
that,
i
think,
is
balanced
on
the
other
side.
for
example,
is
--
do
--
have
we
ever
said
--
and
this
is
an
unusual
statute,
of
course,
with
a
private
attorney
general
and
all
that.
have
we
--
does
--
is
there
any
authority
for
the
idea
that
we
should
read
it
restrictively
because
of
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
have
we
ever
--
have
we
ever
said
that
that's
a
basis
for
reading
the
act
restrictively?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-304,
graham
county
soil
and
water
conservation
district
versus
the
united
states.
