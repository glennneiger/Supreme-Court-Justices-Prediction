mr.

t.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
correct
because
the
text
of
the
false
claims
act
compels
the
result,
and
the
purpose
--
and
also
the
purposes
of
the
1986
amendments
to
the
act.
as
the
fourth
circuit
noted,
congress
grouped
the
disclosure
sources
in
paragraph
(a)
of
the
public
disclosure
bar
into
three
distinct
categories.
in
category
2,
the
term
"administrative"
which
is
at
issue
here
is
sandwiched
between
the
terms
"congressional"--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--no.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
no,
the
--
the
text
of
category
2
compels
the
result
here,
although
we
do
believe
that
the
better
view
of
category
1
is
that
it
is
also
federal
as
well,
and
the
context
--
the
overall
context--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--because
each
of
those
categories
is
distinct,
not
only
grammatically,
but
as
far
as
function.
the
first
category
is
clearly
adjudicative
in
nature.
the
second
is
non-adjudicative.
and
the
third
category
is
--
is
news
media
and
stands
on
its
own.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
the
argument
for
category
2
is
less
compelling,
we
agree.
the
argument
for
category
1
is
most
compelling
because
these
categories
are
distinct
and
should
be
looked
at
as
separate
units
for
that
purpose.
you
have
category
2
as
non-adjudicative,
and
category
1
is
adjudicative.
and
so
you
have
--
you
have
distinction
there.
if
you
were
looking
at
the
three
categories
and,
for
instance,
you
don't
say
category
3
and
say
category
3
is
nongovernmental,
so
therefore
we
should
construe
category
2
to
include
private
administrative
reports.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
yes.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
no.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
no,
we
think
the
better
view
is
that
the
whole
category
is--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--exclusively
federal.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
have
basically
gone
the
other
way,
but
they
have
looked
at
it
in
a
very
superficial
matter
and
have
not
really
directly
addressed
the
issue.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
well,
the
false
claims
act
in
sections,
the
pertinent
sections
3729
and
3730,
refers
to
the
federal
government
many
times
but
never
with
the
modifier
"federal".
they
do
it
through
context.
and
in
fact--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--yes,
the
--
the
legislative
history
shows
throughout
--
beginning
with
the
house
and
senate
bills
and
going
forward
that
these
--
the
earlier
version
shows
these
were
exclusively
federal.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
exactly,
and
you
have
references--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--yes.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
on
that
point,
and
in
fact
if
you
look
at
the
senate
bill
that
was
passed
august
11,
you
have
the
final
version
of
paragraph
(a),
and
then
you
--
which
was
enacted
in
law,
and
paragraph
(b)
was
somewhat
different,
but
it
had
the
phrase
"government
or
news
media",
"disclosures
to
government
or
news
media.
"
it's
clearly
referencing
back
to
paragraph
(a)
and
categorizing
those
sources
as
either
sources
of
capital
"g"
government,
the
federal
government,
or
the
news
media.
and
the
changes
--
the
subsequent
changes
to
paragraph
(b)
give
no
indication
that
congress's
background
understanding
of
that
changed.
there
is
no
indication
of
that.
and
of
course
you
have
the
senate
sponsors
of
the
bill
making
the
same
statements
that
this
was
clearly
federal.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
because
it
gives
no
--
a
report
produced
by
a
state
or
a
local
government
--
and
again,
their
argument
is
not
just
state
but
every
little
local
entity
producing
these
reports
fall
under
the
category
2,
according
to
them.
simply
the
fact
that
a
local
or
state
official
might
be
producing
this
report
gives
no
indication
that
the
federal
government
is
focusing
on
it
or
looking
at
it.
and
in
fact--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--no,
but
congress
was
selecting
general
categories
and
as
a
general
category
the
federal
proceedings
they
thought
were
more
likely
to
put
the
government
on
notice--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--well,
i
think
that
as
a
general
category
it
was
reasonable
for
congress
to
assume
that
the
news
media
disclosures
would
be
disseminated
in
general
to
the
general
public
and
would
put
pressure
on
the
government
to
take
action,
and
the
government
would
pay
attention
to
that
in
general.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
it
said
"news
media".
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
congress
was
drawing
the
lines--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--yes.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
well,
under,
under
--
this
court
recognized
in
cook
county
that
the
1986
amendments
abolished
the
government
knowledge
rule
and
allowed
the
qui
tam
relators
to
bring
cases
even
where
the
government,
federal
government,
had
possession
of
information
about
the
fraud.
what
we
are
doing
here
is
not
even
--
we
are
not
even
sure
the
government
has
possession
of
these
reports.
a
lot
of
these
reports
are
just
sitting
in
file
cabinets
all
around
the
country
in
these
little
administrative
office
buildings.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
correct.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
it
does,
because
congress
drew
it
--
picked
it
as
a
general
category.
they
were
thinking
probably
most
likely
the
new
york
times
or
newspapers
that
have
actual
investigative
reporting
resources,
and
that
was
what
they
had
in
mind.
here
you
have
a
whole--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--one
of
the
huge
problems
with
petitioners'
position
is
it's
going
to
sweep
into
category
2
an
enormous
number
of
reports
and
audits
that
the
federal
government
is
likely
to
never
see,
never
come
across,
and
you
need
these
concerned
citizens
to
go
--
you
want
the
citizens
to
go
and
look
at
these.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
the
petitioners
have
not
pointed
to
an
example
of
a
state
congress.
i
think
it's
generally
conceded
that
that
would
be
federal.
and
also,
when
you
look
at
gao,
that's
clearly
a
federal
entity
there
as
well.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
yes--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--because
reports
and
audits
are
just
a
totally
--
a
category
that
is
much
--
many
magnitudes
greater
than
the
number
of
criminal,
civil,
and
administrative
hearings.
you
are
going
to
have
millions
of
documents
all
over
this
country
in
file
cabinets
that
are
generated
by
local
and
state
governments
that
there
is
no
possibility
the
vast
majority
of
those
would
ever
come
across
the
attention
of
the
federal
government.
and
so
you
want
concerned
citizens
to
be
looking
through,
monitoring
their
local
governments,
digging
up
these
reports
and
bringing
lawsuits
based
on
those.
the
federal
government's
simply
not
going
to
do
it.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
well,
unfortunately
we
have
to
deal
with
the
statute
as
it
is.
and,
you
know,
the
--
our
position
uses
all
the
clues
in
the
statute
to
construe
it.
the
other
side
construes
it
in
a
crude
manner
and
says,
let's
treat
it
like
a
laundry
list,
let's
not
use
any
of
the
grammatical
clues
in
construing
this
language,
and
also
let's
construe
it
in
a
way
that
ignores
what
congress
did
in
1986,
which
was
to
abolish
the
government
knowledge
part.
this
is
a
reimposition
of
that
bar.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
because
it
is
--
congress
did
put
it
in
a
separate
category,
so--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--i
think
that--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--i
think
the
contextual
clues
would
be
less
compelling
there
in
that
situation,
and
you
would
have--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--because
you
would
have
a
category
that
would
have
a
mixture
of
exclusively
federal
and
nonfederal.
here
you
have
a
category
that
you
can't
construe
consistently
as
exclusively
federal,
given
the
contextual
clues
in
there.
so
as
it
is
drafted
now,
if
you
look
at
all
the
clues
you
do
have
distinct
categories
that
can
be
construed
each
on
its
own
merits.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
yes,
as
are
many
reports,
medicaid
reports
by
private
recipients,
today.
this
report
was
only
done
because
the
local
government
was
a
recipient
of
federal
money,
no
different
from
any
private
recipient,
a
not-for-profit.
so
there
was
no
real
distinction
there.
it
was
not
really
a
governmental
report,
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word,
as
it
should
be
construed
or
regarded
for
purposes
of
the
public
disclosure
bar.
and
that's
--
that
shows
the
real
--
one
of
the
real
problems
of
going
down
to
the
--
to
the
local
and
state
level.
you
get
all
of
these
problems
where
the
recipient
is
generating
the
reports
rather
than
the
--
the
administrator
versus
the
recipient.
you
get
all
those
problems
going
down
to
this
level,
the
local
and
state
governments,
and
it
shows
the
real
problem
with
that.
again,
this
is
the
--
the
overall
statute
is
federal,
it's
to
recover
the
federal
government's
money.
the
statute
has
a
strict
dichotomy
between
the
federal
government
and
everyone
else.
if
the
states
or
local
governments
are
going
to
be
qui
tam
relators,
they
bring
it
as
a
private
person.
thank
you.
