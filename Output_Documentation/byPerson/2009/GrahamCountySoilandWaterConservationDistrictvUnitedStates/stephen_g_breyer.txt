justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
arguments
in
this
case,
my
initial
reading
of
them,
are
more
balanced
than
any
i
can
remember,
really.
for
each
one,
there
is
a
counterargument
and
i'm
somewhat
left
up
in
the
air.
so
if
--
since
we
have
to
decide
it,
it
should
--
should
i
take
this
into
account:
that
if
the
respondents
are
right,
you
are
absolutely
correct
that
there
will
be
a
lot
of
people,
perhaps,
who
get
rewards
at
the
federal
government's
expense
who
shouldn't
have
them.
no
question.
they
front-run
the
government.
they
read
the
report,
run
in
court
fast,
before
it's
in
the
newspaper.
but
if
you
are
right,
then
they
are
going
to
have
to
assign
people
to
look
at
these
obscure
administrative
reports
that
didn't
even
get
in
the
newspaper.
so
they
want
to
do
that,
they
don't
have
people
to
do
it,
and
they
say
these
people
are
performing
a
service
of
sorts
by
reading
them,
the
reports,
for
them
and
telling
them
about
it.
and
there
it
is,
balanced.
but
they
are
the
ones
who
suffer.
you
see,
they
suffer
both
ways.
they
suffer
if
people
don't
tell
them;
they
suffer
if
in
fact
too
many
people
are
getting
unjustified
rewards
because
the
money
comes
from
the
federal
government,
the
10
percent,
25
percent.
so
if
they're
the
ones
who
suffer,
should
i
not
pay
special
attention
to
their
views
as
to
how
the
balance
works
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
you
can
tell,
i
have
taken
that
point
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
my
question
wasn't
that.
my
question
was,
should
i
or
should
i
not
give
them
a
little
expertise
weight
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
the
ones
who
know
it
best,
that
they
are
the
victims?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is,
what
sense
does
that
make?
i
mean
--
and
i
thought
you
said
that
the
category
1,
which
is
the
criminal
proceeding,
civil
or
administrative
proceeding,
i
thought
you
said
it
does
not
apply
to
state
proceedings
in
your
view.
you
said
that
was
the
better
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
state
of
the
law
on
that?
i
thought
it
was
virtually
--
what
is
the
state
of
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
you'd
have
to
say
that.
but
--
but
now,
what
is
the
state
of
law
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
i
mean,
to
me
it
makes
no
sense.
we
are
only
talking
about
things
that
don't
get
into
the
newspapers.
so
--
and
the
purpose
of
the
federal
government's
reading
of
this
would
be,
look,
we
don't
have
people
to
go
send
around
to
every
--
read
every
state
report.
we
just
don't
have
that
personnel.
so
we
rely
on
these
whistleblowers
and
we
know
some
will
be
unjustified.
i
would
think
the
same
thing
would
be
absolutely
true
of
state
criminal
proceedings
that
don't
get
into
the
newspaper.
there
are
probably
50
--
several
thousands
--
thousands
and
thousands.
so
how
to
read
these
differently
is
a
problem
for
me.
and
i
think
that's
on
your
side
of
it.
but
we
are
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
which
to
me
is
the
--
is
the
question
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
history,
which
i
pay
attention
to
--
is
there
any
legislative
history
or
anything
else
that
you
can
point
to,
to
me
that's
important,
showing
that
that
first
criminal
hearing
means
just
federal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
meant
criminal
hearing.
criminal
hearing
meant
federal
criminal
hearing,
not
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
"exactly".
i
was
looking
for
the
backup
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
to
get
your
expertise
on
this,
because
you
have
probably
read
the
legislative
history
of
the
1986
amendment.
all
right,
am
i
right
in
thinking
this?
if
i
go
back
and
read
it
--
which
i
will
--
i
will
discover,
not
once
in
this
entire
1986
history
anywhere,
house,
senate
or
conference,
does
the
word
state
appear
in
any
relevant
context?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
right.
okay.
so
when
it
appears--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i'm
--
the
relevant
context
has
to
do
in
my
mind
at
the
moment
primarily
in
respect
to
the
first
clause,
"criminal,
civil,
or
administrative
proceeding.
"
is
there
any
indication
that
those
were
meant
to
apply
--
any
indication
that
those
were
meant
to
apply
to
state
as
opposed
to
uniquely
federal,
criminal,
civil,
or
administrative
proceedings?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
clear
from
the
record
--
clear
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
word
hearing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
is
one
ambiguity
whether
this
clause,
the
first
--
what
we
call
first
and
second
refers
to
state
as
well
as
federal.
if
the
debate
took
place
in
a
context
where
everyone's
just
thinking
of
federal,
it's
not
surprising
they
didn't
put
in
the
word
federal.
they
don't
think
of
everything.
all
right.
now,
that's
my
question.
you
started
with
the
house.
the
house
to
me
does
think
just
of
federal.
the
senate's
ambiguous
on
that
point--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
conference
is
yet
more
ambiguous
on
that
point.
so
is
there
anything
--
when
i
look
at
the
conference
and
the
senate
versions,
i'm
going
to
say,
gee,
they
did
--
sorry,
they
did
actually
think
of
federal
and
state,
too,
and
it's
sort
of
mixed
up?
or
am
i
going
to
see
that
that
context
there
is
federal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
i
think
it's
the
silence,
though,
that
might
cut
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
that
it's
--
it's
basically
silence
--
the
reason
i
am
thinking
that
cuts
against
you
is
because
of
this
sorting
of
the
context
where
they
are
focusing
on
federal.
and,
if
everybody
is
working
in
that
context,
then
nothing
said
about
state
means
they
are
just
assuming
it's
all
applying
to
federal.
now,
what
i'm
looking
for,
you
might
be
able
to
put
your
finger
on,
is
something
that
shows
that
my
last
statement
is
not
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
in
the
--
it
was
--
it
probably
came
out
in
governmental
affairs
in
the
senate,
which
i
think
had
17
members
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
point
here
is
--
i
will
put
it
in
cash
terms,
is
the
federal
government,
who
will
pay
a
lot
of
qui
tam
lawyers
some
percent
to
go
and
look
through
all
these
state
criminal
hearings
and
state
reports
and
all
these
things
that
didn't
get
into
the
newspaper
and
to
bring
cases,
so
it
may
be
cheaper
to
pay
them
then
it
would
be
to
hire
staff
to
do
that.
now,
your
point
is
that
they
get
a
little
over-enthusiastic
sometimes,
and
they
can
bring
actions
that
maybe
not
be
so
well-justified,
and
the
--
the
federal
government
is
going
to
have
to
hire
people
to
sort
those
out
anyway,
and
so
would
the
states
in
that
kind
of
mess.
is
that
your
point?
