mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
erisa
case,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
a
deferential
standard
of
review
to
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
the
xerox
plan,
but
not
to
the
plan
administrator's
interpretation.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
got
it
backwards.
under
either
a
deferential
standard
of
review
or
a
de
novo
standard,
the
plan
administrator's
interpretation
should
prevail.
that
interpretation,
unlike
the
district
court's
interpretation,
is
grounded
in
the
language
of
the
plan.
it
recognizes
the
fundamental
actuarial
principle
of
the
time
value
of
money,
and
it
avoids
conferring
windfalls.
in
firestone
and
glenn,
this
court
looked
to
the
language
of
the
plan,
which
reflects
the
intent
of
the
plan's
sponsor.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
we
think
under
trust
law,
which
the
court
has
looked
to
in
glenn
and
firestone,
where
the
plan
of
the
settlor
of
the
trust
has
assigned
the
responsibility
for
making
the
discretionary
determinations
to
the
plan
administrator
or
to
the
trustee,
unless
there's
been
a
showing
of
bad
faith
or
some
other
reason
to
think
that
the
discretion
will
not
be
exercised
honestly
and
fairly,
it
--
it
is
really
up
to
the
plan
administrator
to
make
that
discretionary
determination--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
we--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
think
these
situations
of
the
--
of
the
multiple
bites
at
the
apple
will
be
rare.
trust
law
has
had
this
rule
for
decades,
and
that
has
not
been
a
problem--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i'd
--
i'd
have
a
two-part
answer,
justice
breyer--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
first,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
quite
unusual
to
say
the
standard
of
review
is
up
to
the
court,
that
it
can
be
either--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well
--
well,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
professor
scott,
who
was
the
reporter
for
both
the
second
and
the
first
restatement--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
whose
treatise
correlates
with
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
section
numbers
correlate
exactly
with
the
sections
of
the
restatement
for
which
he
was
reporter.
if
you
look
in
section
187
of
his
treatise,
which
correlates
with
section
187
of
the
restatement
second,
the
principle
is
that
unless
there's
been
bad
faith
or
some
other
reason
to
expect
that
the
trustee
will
not
exercise
the
discretion
fairly
and
honestly
--
i
mean,
there
--
and
there
are
examples,
illustrations
11
and
12.
if
--
if
the
amount
is
unreasonably
low--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
it's
quite
different,
with
--
with
respect,
justice
breyer.
the
--
the
reconstructed
account
methodology
really
looked
to
the
performance
of
a
hypothetical
account,
but
the
--
what
we
call
the
plan
administrator's
interpretation,
the
interpretation
that
came
up
for
the
first
time
after
the
second
circuit,
overruling
the
district
court,
said,
you
know,
this
plan
provision
that
clearly
tells
you
how
to
do
it
is
actually
invalid--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--because
it
wasn't
properly
disclosed.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
we
think
the
standard
is
that
if
--
as
long
as
there
is
discretion
to
be
exercised
within
the
limits
that
would
be
set
by
the
court's
opinion,
absent
a
showing
of
bad
faith
or
other
reason
to
think
the
discretion
won't
be
exercised
honestly
and
fairly,
it
ought
to
be
left
to
the
plan
administrator,
because
that's
what
the
plan
provides.
now,
i
think--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
and
that's
right
at
the
heart
of
the
case,
and
you
are
quite
correct.
the
second
circuit
did
say
there
was
not
adequate
notice
of
the
reconstructed
account
methodology,
but
it's
an
important
part
of
our
submission
that
the
plan
administrator's
interpretation
on
remand
is
significantly
different.
this
is
the
way
these
offsets
are
typically
done.
there's
nothing
hypothetical
about
it.
you
take
the
lump
sum
that
was
actually
paid
to
these
plan
participants.
you
look
to
the
annuity
that
could
have
been
purchased
with
that
lump
sum,
using
the
annuity
rates
that
are
put
out
by
the
federal
government,
by
the
pbgc.
this
is
the
typical
way
this
offset
is
performed.
this
is
--
falls
within
the
safe
harbor,
the
chief
actuaries
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
saying
this
is
quite
typical,
so
this--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
and
the
--
and
the
second
circuit
did
not
decide
this
question
of
whether
the
notice
of
the
plan
administrator's
interpretation
was
sufficient,
and
--
but
we
think
there
are
very
strong
arguments
that
it
--
that
it
was.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
it
did
describe
the
circumstances
in
which
there
could
be
an
offset,
which
is
what
the
statute
and
the
regulation
requires.
and,
second,
it
is
the
law
in
the
second
circuit,
as
elsewhere,
that
in
a
summary
plan
description
--
which
is
just
that,
a
summary
--
you
need
not
describe
in
detail
every
offset
and
every
actuarial
adjustment.
there
are
many
such
adjustments
in
erisa
plans.
they
frequently
apply
to
relatively
small
numbers
of
participants.
if
it
were
a
requirement
of
the
statute
that
each
of
these
be
described
in
detail
in
a
summary
plan
description,
you
would
risk
defeating
the
purpose
of
the
summary
plan
description
and
invalidating
many
erisa
plans
across
the
country.
so
we
would
urge
the
court,
strongly,
not
to
accept
this
argument
that,
oh,
well,
you
know,
if
the
--
if
the
notice
of
the
reconstructed
account
methodology
is
inadequate,
then
it
must
also
be
the
case
that
the
notice
of
this
different
--
i
would
say
"plain
vanilla"
kind
of
offset
--
typical
offset,
must
also
be
inadequate.
we
don't
think
that
is
true--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
at
the
time
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--when
it
went
back
on
remand
from
the
second
circuit
the
first
time,
the
plan
administrator
adopted
a
--
a
new
interpretation.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is
what
i'm
calling
the
"plain
vanilla"--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well
--
and
there
was
a
provision
in
the
plan
that
specifically
told
him
to
do
the
offset
in
this
way,
and
the
second
circuit--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
no.
it
was
also
in
the
plan
before
1990.
it--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
a
lot
of
this
case
started
because
it
got
dropped
out
of
the
1989
restatement,
by
accident,
for
a
period
of
3
months,
and
all
of
these
dire
consequences
are
really
flowing
from
that.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
there
--
there
was.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
and
that's
another
important
point
in
this
complicated
case.
i
mean,
the
only
period
in
which
this
--
what
we
call
the
reconstructed
account
methodology
that
gave
specific
instructions
about
how
to
do
it,
so
we
say
it
was
not
at
all
unreasonable
for
the
plan
administrator
to
follow
those
specific
instructions.
it
dropped
out
in
this
1989
restatement
for
a
very
short
period
and
then
got
put
back
in.
and
that's
--
the
second
circuit
said,
well,
then
you
get
into
problems
with
anti-cutback
and
different
types
of
things,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--there
were
a
variety
of
summary
plan
descriptions,
obviously,
and
i
think,
in
general,
justice
ginsburg,
they
simply
had
the
statement
that
your
benefit
may
be
reduced,
if
you
have
received
a
prior
distribution.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
--
that
is
correct,
during
that
period,
although,
again--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it
was--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
it
was
really
in
about
1995.
the
descriptions
got
gradually
more
detailed,
as
we
go
into
the
1990s,
but
through
the
'80s
and
up
into
the
--
i
think
until
about
1995
or
so,
there
would
have
been
simply
a
statement
that
your
benefit
may
be
reduced--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--oh
--
well,
i'm
sorry
if
i
misunderstood
you,
justice
scalia.
i
was
talking
about
the
language
of
the
plan,
and
we
are,
after
all,
talking
about
benefits
due
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
and
the
plan
did
include
this
specific
reconstructed
account
methodology,
except
for
the
3-month
period.
now,
the
summary
plan
description
had
a--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--had
a
much
--
a
much
briefer
--
but,
again--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--an
additional
point
on
this,
justice
scalia,
is
--
i
mean,
this
is
a
claim
for
benefits
due
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
and,
you
know,
there
--
there's
actually
a
circuit
split
on
this.
but
if
the
claim
is
something
like,
well,
a
summary
plan
description
wasn't
good
enough;
it
didn't
contradict
the
plan,
and
it
told
me
the
circumstances
in
which
the
benefits
might
be
reduced,
but
it
didn't
tell
me
how
--
and,
that's
just
not
good
enough.
often,
you
have
to
make
some
sort
of
showing
of
reliance
and
prejudice,
so
it's
really--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
they
call
it
phantom
accounting.
right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well
--
well,
no,
and
i
--
i
mean,
what
happened
is
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
they
were
hired
after
the
--
rehired
after
the
1989
restatement
went
into
effect,
and
so
that's
when
this
--
when
this
provision
that
specifically
described
the
reconstructed
account
methodology
was
dropped
out,
and
that's
when
all
the
trouble
started.
the
only
reason
i
was
mentioning
the
reconstructed
account
methodology
was
trying
to
address
justice
scalia's
question,
although
i
may
have
confused
it
further
to
say
that
the
plan,
the
terms
of
the
plan,
did
include
this
specific
provision,
so
it
was
not
crazy
for
the
plan
administrator
to
be
following
that.
now,
it
was
struck
down
by
the
second
circuit,
invalidated,
and
the
plan
administrator
is
not
seeking
to
challenge
that
on
remand;
obviously,
they
can't.
but
coming
up
with
a--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--absolutely.
it's
the
remaining--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--absolutely.
it's
the
remaining
plan
terms;
there
is
a
new
interpretive
question
here,
which
is:
how
do
we
make
sense
of
the
remaining
plan
terms,
now
that
the
second
circuit
--
unlike
the
plan
administrator,
unlike
the
district
court
--
has
held
that
this
provision
that
specifically
addresses
this
is
invalid
and
can't
be
used.
and
that
is
really
a
new
interpretive
question
that
came
up
in
litigation.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--justice--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
mean,
just
a
couple
of
points
in
response,
justice--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
mean,
first
of
all,
it's
not
just
the
word
"duplication"
or
"non-duplication".
section
9.6,
which
is
on
page
32a
of
the
joint
appendix,
says
that
if
there
has
been
a
prior
distribution,
the
accrued
benefit
based
on
all
the
years
of
participation--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--shall
be
offset
by
the
accrued
benefit
attributable
to
such
distribution.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
no,
your
honor,
the
judgment
of
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
was
what--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
--
but,
i
mean,
it's
similar
in
a
sense
that
i
think
is
clearly
favorable
to
the
plan--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
mean,
if
i
could
--
this
is
a
floor-offset
plan,
and
the
basic
concept
of
the
flooroffset
plan
is
to
give
a
kind
of
an
insurance
policy,
that
if
the
defined
contribution
plan
performs
poorly,
the
defined
benefit
component
of
the
plan
will
guarantee
that
you
get
a
certain
minimum
benefit.
and
so
the
way
the
thing
works,
if
the
defined
contribution
balance
is
above
the
defined
benefit,
then
your
defined
contribution
is
your
benefit.
and
that's
good.
that
means
you
have
exceeded
the
floor.
and
what
happened
here
is
--
this
whole
thing
--
we
are
calculating
the
defined
benefit,
the
floor.
that's
what
we
are
doing,
and
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
what
sort
of
offset
do
you
take
into
account
because
these
people
got
lump
sums;
in
some
cases
quite,
quite
large.
mr.
frommert
got
almost
$145,000
10
or
20
years
ago.
so
if
--
the
notion
is,
if
mr.
frommert
had
continued
working
for
xerox
throughout
his
career,
this
money
would
have
continued
to
grow;
it
would
have
increased
his
defined
contribution
benefit;
and
he
would
have
not
needed
to
use
his
insurance
policy--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but
--
and
the
key
point--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but
the
key
point,
if
i
--
yes.
but
the
key
point
is
he
had
the
use
of
this
money
for
all
these
years.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
--
and
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
pensions,
of
erisa,
that
there
is
a
time
value
of
money.
and
if
you
accept
this
interpretation
that
the
district
court
adopted,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
said:
well,
we
will
just
give
it
deferential
review;
we
won't
even
give
it
de
novo
review,
it's
--
it's,
you
know,
one
reasonable
interpretation
among
many--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
in
terms
of
whether
this
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
the
plan,
it
is
a
question
of
law.
and
i
think
it
is
unreasonable
--
i
mean,
certainly,
looking
at
the
plan
language,
there
is
plan
language
that
does
speak
to
this,
and
then
also,
i
mean,
this--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but
it's
a
claim
for
benefits
due
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
you
know,
i
read
you
the
language.
"accrued
benefit"
is
a
defined
term
in
the
plan.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
so,
that
--
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
us
that
if
you're
talking
about
the
terms
of
the
plan,
even
if
you're
trying
to
fashion
a
remedy
for
a
violation
of
erisa,
that
is
still
a
de
novo
review
question,
and
there
would
be
terrible
problems
with
uniformity
of
plan
interpretation
if
you
said,
oh,
well,
you
know,
it's
just
a
discretionary
kind
of
review;
let's
let
every
district
court
interpret
this
plan
in
its
own
fashion.
but
--
but
the
notion
of
having
--
essentially,
what
the
district
court's
interpretation
does
is
to
say
we're
going
to
have
a
zero
interest
rate,
which
is
--
i
mean,
the
chief
actuary's
brief
says
they
have
never
in
their
entire
careers,
none
of
them,
have
ever
seen
an
erisa
plan
that
does
that.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
until
the
district
court
said
it
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
this
plan.
and,
in
fact--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
you
--
absolutely
you
start
with
the
language,
and
we
don't
think
it
is
quite
that
bare
bones.
the
section
9.6,
which
says
the
offset
is
the
accrued
benefit
attributable
to
the
prior
distribution,
and
then
section
1.1,
which
is
the
definition
of
65
in
an
amount
computed
in
accordance
with
section
4.3.
and
then
4.3
says
the
monthly
benefit
which
could
be
purchased
with
the
member's
transitional
retirement
account
--
that's
the
defined
contribution
account
--
as
calculated
using
--
using
annuity
rates
established
by
the
pbgc.
so
it's
not
quite
that
bare-bones.
but
then
we
would
also
say
--
you
would
look
to
this
notion
that
the
time
value
of
money
is
an
absolutely
central
concept
to
pensions,
and
the
notion
of
people
would
have
use
of
money
for
10
years
or
20
years
at
a
zero
interest
rate
--
and
indeed,
it's
--
it's
even
worse
than
that
because,
i
mean,
ultimately
this
has
to
be
expressed
in
the
form
of
an
annuity.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
with
--
with
respect,
justice
alito,
that
is
absolutely
ridiculous.
i
mean,
no
employer
would
do
that
to
their
current
employees.
that
would
treat
the
current
employees
like
suckers.
and
it
certainly
didn't
happen
here.
there's
no
evidence
that
that
happened.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
that
has
ever
happened.
i
mean,
you
can
give
people
a
bonus--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
if
you--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--if
you
said
to
the
current
employees
--
i
mean,
basically,
mr.
frommert,
to
take
him
as
an
example,
he's
--
i
mean,
if
someone
who
is
otherwise
similarly
situated
to
him
had
just
kept
working
for
xerox,
they
would
not
have
needed
the
insurance
policy,
either.
their
defined
contribution
account
would
have
been
above
the
floor,
and
so
they
would
get
their
defined
contribution
account.
mr.
frommert
had
the
use
of
all
this
money
for
all
these
years.
we
don't
know
what
he
invested
it
in,
but
presumably
it
grew
in
the
investments.
but
under
the
district
court's
interpretation,
he--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--exactly.
they'd
say
i've
been
working--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
and
--
and
that's
what
the
plan
administrator's
interpretation
is
trying
to
achieve
as
closely
as
possible
for
the
rehires.
it's
trying
to
treat
them
the
same.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--absolutely,
justice
scalia,
the
defined
contribution.
now,
in
this
case,
for
mr.
frommert,
for
example,
was
this
large
lump
sum
that
he
got.
i
mean,
another
fact
i'll
mention
is
that
xerox
stopped
making
additional
contributions
to
this
defined
contribution
account
in
1990,
just
when
mr.
frommert
returned.
that's
--
that's
where
this
$5
thing
comes
from.
his
benefit,
his
defined
contribution
benefit,
was
that
large
lump
sum
given
many
years
before
a
normal
retirement
date.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the
remaining
plan
terms
are
not
silent.
section
9.6
says
that
the
offset
should
be
the
accrued
benefit
attributable
to
the
prior
lump-sum
distribution,
and
that's
an
annuity
payable
at
age
65.
so
there
is
plan
language.
it's
--
it
is
not
completely
unambiguous,
but
the
plan
is
certainly
not
silent,
and
the
solicitor
general,
in
its
brief
on
the
merits
to
this
court
did
--
retracted
that
suggestion
that
the
plan
was
silent.
on
this
question
of
the
1990
amendment
and
when
the
--
the
reconstructed
account
methodology
that
the
second
circuit
said
was
invalid
got
put
back
in,
pages
66a
and
67a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
shows
that
that
got
put
back
in,
in
1990,
and
not
later.
on
trust
law
and
what
trust
law
shows,
obviously,
the
court
will
have
to
sort
it
out,
but
we
stand
with
professor
scott,
with
his
treatise,
which
is
key,
to
the
restatement
second,
which
was
in
effect
when
erisa
was
adopted.
section
187
of
his
treatise,
which
correlates
with
section
187
of
the
restatement
second,
we
think
supports
our
approach
that,
unless
there
is
bad
faith
or
the
trustee
is
acting
outside
the
bounds
of
discretion
--
and
the
court
will
get
the
trustee
within
the
bounds
of
discretion,
but
unless
there
is
some
reason
to
think
the
trustee
can't
fairly
and
honestly
exercise
the
discretion,
the
terms
of
the
trust
assign
that
responsibility
to
the
trustee,
and,
therefore,
the
trustee
should
exercise
that
discretion.
and
then,
finally,
on
this
question
of
notice
and
whether
there
was
adequate
notice,
not
of
the
reconstructed
account
methodology,
but
of
the
plain
vanilla
annuity,
the
ordinary
way
this
is
done,
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
accept
these
representations
that,
oh,
it's
just
the
same
question;
if
the
notice
for
one
is
inadequate,
the
notice
for
the
other
must
also
be
inadequate.
i
mean,
there's
actually
second
circuit
law,
the
mccarthy
against
dun
&
bradstreet
case,
that
holds
that
a
summary
plan
description
does
not
have
to
completely
explain
how
you
do
every
offset
and
actuarial
adjustment.
there
are
so
many
of
them.
many
of
them
apply
just
to
relatively
small
groups
of
people,
including
this
one
that
we're
talking
about.
there
are
14,000--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
if
the
court
had
actually
held
that
--
i
mean,
i
would
urge
you
not
to
read
the
court's
opinion
that
way.
i
mean,
i
think,
if
it
held
that,
i
think
that
would
be
a
mistake
because
there
--
there
are
--
you
know,
it's
just
so
typical
that
you
have
actuarial
adjustments
in
pensions
and
in
--
and
in
general.
i
mean,
people
don't
expect
to
take
out
a
mortgage
on
a
house
for
20
years
and
pay
no
interest
or
buy
a
bond
from
the
treasury
for
20
years
and
receive
no
interest.
so
i
think,
if
it's
going
to
be
the
ordinary,
plain
vanilla
way
this
is
done,
the
pbgc
way,
the
safe
harbor
way,
it
may
be
sufficient
--
may
very
well
be
sufficient
to
simply--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right,
and
--
and
those
statements,
which
are
non-plan
documents,
said
there
--
there
may
be
an
adjustment
or
there
will
be
an
adjustment
for
prior
distributions.
and
in
a
case
like
mr.
frommert's,
that's
the
$5
case,
the
reason
it's
$5
is
because
his
entire
defined
contribution
benefit
virtually
came
from
that
large
lump
sum.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
because
those
--
those
particular
forms,
which
again
are
not
plan
documents
and
he
really
should
show
individual
reliance
and
prejudice,
didn't
do
the
calculation.
he
got
another
document
that
did
do
the
calculation,
and
that's
when
this
started.
thank
you,
your
honor.
