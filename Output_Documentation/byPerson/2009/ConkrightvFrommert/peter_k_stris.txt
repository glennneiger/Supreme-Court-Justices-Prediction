mr.
peter
k.
stris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
hearing
mr.
long,
i'd
like
to
address
my
remarks
to
two
broad
areas.
first,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
why
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
were
not
required
to
defer
the
legal
principle.
and
then
in
light
of
some
of
the
factual
claims
he
has
made,
which
are
belied
by
the
record
and
directly
contradict
the
findings
of
the
lower
court
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
explain
why
they
didn't
defer.
because
sitting
here,
the
irony
to
me
is
the
core
focus
of
his
position
is
that
courts
have
episodic
involvement
with
these
very
complicated
plans,
and
yet,
as
i'll
get
to
in
my
second
point,
most
of
his
position
is
predicated
on
things
that
are
directly
contrary
to
the
court
in
this
case
that
was
on
the
ground
that
looked
at
these
issues.
he
wants
this
court,
which
has
even
less
of
an
--
a
typical
and
constant
involvement
with
the
plan,
to
second-guess
the
lower
court,
but--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--yes.
to
me,
that's
the
most
difficult
question
in
this
case.
i'm
--
i'm
glad
we
are
going
straight
to
it.
but
then
i'm
going
to
go
back
to
deference
just
to
make
sure
we
don't
lose
on
that
point,
where
i
think
we
are
squarely
right.
now
to
your
question.
here's
what
happened:
xerox
made
two
arguments
in
the
first
round
of
litigation.
this
is
very
important.
their
first
argument
was
that
a
later
plan
applied
retroactively.
they
didn't
want
to
apply
the
'89
plan.
their
second
argument
--
and
this
is
--
here
are
the
best
places
where
you
can
find
it:
page
42a
of
the
petition
appendix
--
that's
the
second
circuit;
page
75a
and
85a
of
the
petition
appendix
--
this
is
where
the
district
court
said
it.
their
second
argument
was
that
section
9.6
of
the
1989
plan
permitted
an
appreciated
offset,
something
more
than
just
a
nominal
offset.
this
was
rejected
as
arbitrary
and
capricious.
now,
the
phantom
account
was
rejected,
but
so
was
the
broad
principle
that
there
could
be
an
appreciated
offset.
now,
here's
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
alito:
it
would
have
been
totally
appropriate
at
that
point
in
time
for
the
second
circuit
to
say
there's
going
to
be
a
nominal
offset.
we
would
have
been
done.
we
wouldn't
be
here
anymore.
but
xerox
essentially
made
a
fairness
argument.
they
said:
well,
this
is
a
scrivener's
error;
we
only
left
this
out
for
3
months
--
which
isn't
true,
by
the
way.
they
left
it
out
for
5
years.
but
the
court
said:
well,
if
that's
true
and
if
this
is
going
to
be
windfall,
maybe
xerox
has
an
equitable
defense.
this
is
an
(a)(1)(b)
claim
for
--
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
but
they
remanded
this
to
the
lower
court
out
of
consideration
for
xerox,
so
that
the
lower
court
could
look
at
equitable
principles
and
say:
well,
since
the
plan
doesn't
foreclose
an
appreciation,
maybe
under
equity
we
should
have
some
appreciation.
and
then
what
happened
--
and
this
is
the
irony
--
is
xerox
went
back
--
and
this
right
out
of
page
143a
of
the
joint
appendix
--
they
proposed
an
offset
that
effectively
is
an
undisclosed
$16
million
appreciation.
here's
why
this
is
important:
their
phantom
account
in
the
first
round,
it
was
an
undisclosed
$17
million
appreciation.
they
didn't
come
in
and
say
--
they
made
equitable
arguments.
if
you
look
at
their
briefs,
they
said:
we're
--
we're
not
saying
that
this
is
what
the
plan
means,
but
the
plan
has
been
invalidated;
we're
going
to
make
equitable
arguments
of
things
that
might
be
consistent
with
the
plan.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
the
position
i
--
i
would
take:
i
think
if
they
did
them
at
the
same
time
--
it's
a
difficult
question
--
i
think
they
would,
because
i
think
if
you
give
them
at
the
same
time
and
you
admit
that
there
is
an
ambiguity,
you're
giving
the
court
options.
you
are
saying:
defer
to
my
judgment;
i
think
this
is
right,
but
here's
the
alternative.
what
xerox
did
here,
and
this
is
very
important:
they
made
the
strategic
choice
in
round
one
of
this
litigation
to
say
we
think
there
is
one
option,
it's
terrible
for
--
for
petitioners--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--no,
i
--
i
don't
--
well,
i
guess
i
would
give
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is,
in
the
first
instance,
if
you
seriatim
said
here
are
12
different
interpretations
of
the
plan
in
ranked
order,
i
don't
think
you
would
get
deference.
i
think
for
efficiency's
sake,
like
you
say,
we
want
administrators
to
say:
this
is
what
we
think
the
interpretation
of
the
plan
is.
i
agree
with
you.
but
in
a
rare
case
like
this
one
--
where
xerox's
main
point
is:
we
screwed
up;
we
left
out
the
provision
--
i
think
the
appropriate
thing
for
xerox
to
do
would
have
said:
we
think
we
can
rely
on
it
and
take
this
interpretation,
even
though
we
left
out
the
provision;
but
if
not,
then
this
is
how
we
interpret
the
plan.
i'm
not
saying
you
would
--
they
would
definitely
get
deference,
but
at
least
there
would
be
an
argument
that
there's
a
presumption
of
competence,
that
there's
efficiency.
here,
the
standard
trust
law
rule,
which
i'm
going
to
get
to
in
a
second,
says:
you
staked
your
ground,
xerox.
you
said
that
this
is
what
you
thought
the
plan
meant.
we
held
that
you
were
arbitrary
and
capricious,
not
an
--
not
an
honest
--
not
a
small
procedural
mistake.
you
--
you
picked
something
that
was
unreasonable,
and
now
you
want
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
no.
yes,
i--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--right.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
and
--
and
this
is
the
core
answer
to
your
question:
that
is
why
the
law,
under
the
common
law
of
trusts,
said
that
once
there
was
a
finding
by
a
court
of
abuse
of
discretion,
it
could
decide
to
defer.
i
agree
with
xerox.
ordinarily,
the
courts
would
defer.
under
erisa,
ordinarily,
if
there's
factual
issues,
they
send
it
back.
here,
the
court
said,
under
these
specific
facts,
under
this
abuse
of
discretion,
for
a
host
of
reasons,
not
the
least
of
which,
your
honor,
is
that
they
are
trying
to
take
a
fallback
position
on
the
exact
same
issue,
which
the
court
expressly
found
in
this
case.
they
exercised
their
discretion
not
to
defer.
the
rule
--
in
order
for
xerox
to
get
reversal
on
the
first
question,
they
have
to
convince
this
court
that
what
the
rule
should
be
is
that,
not
that
--
not
--
we
don't
have
to
convince
you
that
there
should
be
--
there
shouldn't
be
deference
in
all
of
these
cases.
they
have
to
convince
you
that
a
lower
court
never
has
the
option,
unless
there's
a
finding
of
bad
faith,
to
say,
yeah,
i'm
not
going
to
defer.
and
that's
not
the
law.
this
very
court,
in
1888,
in
the
colton
case,
which
the
government
cites
in
their
brief,
and
we
--
and
we
cite,
there
--
the
trustee
said:
we're
not
giving
a
benefit.
the
court
said:
that's
arbitrary
and
capricious.
this
court
ordered
the
lower
courts
to
set
the
benefit.
they
never
made
a
finding
of
bad
faith.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
okay.
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
tell
you
the
factors
that
existed
at
trust
law
and
in
erisa
and
that
i
think
they
are
right.
one
very
important
factor
is:
is
it
the
exact
same
question?
and
here
it
was.
it
was
the
same
question.
i
disagree
with
mr.
long's
characterization.
they
took
a
position
as
an
alternative
on
the
meaning
of
section
9.6
under
this
plan.
now,
they
want
to
say,
well,
now,
we're
going
to
rely
on
different
provisions,
in
addition
to
the
one
we
did
before,
but,
i
mean
--
justice
scalia,
to
your
question
earlier
--
that
would
be
like
saying:
here's
a
contract;
i
think
that
we
--
i
interpret
this
provision
looking
at
pages
1
and
2.
you
hold
that
i
acted
in
an
arbitrary
fashion.
and
i
say,
okay,
i
want
to
interpret
it
again;
i'm
going
to
look
at
1
and
2,
but
this
time,
i'm
going
to
look
at
pages
7,
8,
9;
it's
a
new
issue
because
i
didn't
consider
those
--
those
points
before.
it's
still
the
same
question,
so
that's
one
factor.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
oh,
i
--
i--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--yes,
i
--
i
wouldn't
exactly
say
that.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
yes.
what
the
court
of
appeal--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--no.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
--
now,
actually,
there's
three
things
i'd
like
to
respond
to,
and
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
factors.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
spds
did
not
disclose
an
appreciation.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
relevant
provision
in
this
plan,
the
only
one
that
would
have
applied
time
value
of
money
was
missing,
but
i
argue
that
the
consequence
of
these
things
is
that
you
can't
have
a
time
value
of
money.
so
i
am
going
to
get
to
that
in
a
second.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
now,
to
the
last
point
you
made
about
it's
a
different
issue.
i
think
we're
saying
the
same
thing.
this
is
semantic.
yes,
xerox
is
right,
that
the
task
was
slightly
different.
the
first
time,
they
interpreted
what
the
offset
should
be
under
the
'89
plan,
looking
at
a
few
things,
and
this
time,
they
said,
oh,
we
were
arbitrary,
so,
now,
we
would
like
to
resolve
the
same
legal
question,
looking
at
a
few
more
things.
so,
in
one
sense--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--or
--
or
you
may
spend
it.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
during
my
time,
it--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--okay.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
--
i
understand
that
entirely.
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
things.
all
of
these
points
would
be
very
important
if
we
were
designing
a
plan
in
the
first
place.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
result
in
this
case
is
what
parties
would
bargain
to
in
the
first
instance,
if
they
had
all
the
information.
i'm
not
going
to
defend
that.
the
question
here
is
xerox
left
a
provision
out
of
the
plan,
and
now
we
have
a
problem.
what
are
we
going
to
do?
that's
how
we
get
to
equity.
in
fact,
i
think
it
would
have
been
appropriate
--
if
i
were
litigating
the
case
at
that
point,
i
would
have
argued
you
can't
have
an
equitable
defense,
you
need
to
enforce
the
nominal
offset,
but
that
ship
has
sailed.
so
we
go
back
on
remand,
and
to
--
to
mr.
long's
point
about
how
it's
standard
to
have
an
actuarial
offset
--
take
disclosure
away
for
a
minute.
it's
not
standard
to
apply
the
--
the
time
value
of
money
to
the
entire
defined
contribution
balance.
i
will
not
accept
that
characterization.
under
the
principle
of
duplication,
we
presented
an
alternative
that
used
the
time
value
of
money
offset,
but
it
applied
it
to
the
relevant
principle.
xerox
didn't
like
that,
so
they
--
they
advocated
something
else.
here's
why
it's
relevant
to
your
question--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
don't
think
so.
this
is
a
defined
benefits
plan,
and
--
you
know,
from
a
regulatory
standpoint,
as
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
it
is
a
defined
benefits
plan.
section
9.6
of
the
plan
talks
about
non-duplication.
with
no
other
information,
if
--
if
you
force
me
to
say,
well,
let's
make
an
argument,
what
are
we
going
to
think
about
non-duplication,
we're
trying
to
say
that
we're
not
going
to
give
you
money
under
this
floor
--
as
you
put
it,
justice
breyer
--
of
the
defined
benefits
plan,
if
it
duplicates
your
prior
defined
benefit
payment.
what
my
clients
got
was
from
an
entirely
separate
plan,
and
it
was
a
defined
contribution
plan.
they're
integrated--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
actually
think
that's
not
true.
it's
not
clear
from
the
record,
but
my
understanding
is
that
most
of
my
clients
didn't
--
didn't
have
that
option.
now,
i'd
like
to
get
back,
just
for
a
second,
justice
alito,
to
your
question,
because
it
goes
to
the
core
of
deference.
another
very
important
factor
is,
are
there
fact
questions?
and
this
is
important
because
you're
thinking
about
broad
principle.
this
comes
up
in
erisa
all
the
time.
i
see
this
all
the
time.
even
after
an
abuse
of
discretion,
courts
regularly
say,
we
are
going
to
send
this
back,
because
they're
not
going
to
be
in
the
business
of
holding
evidentiary
hearings
and
looking
at
complicated
fact
questions.
so
that's
a
factor
that
--
where
you
might
say,
you
know
what?
they
abused
their
discretion,
but
i'm
sending
it
back.
not
only
was
that
not
an
issue
here,
the
lower
courts
explicitly
held
that
they
waived
this,
they
didn't
want
it
sent
back.
another
important
factor
is
whether
or
not
it's
a
regulatory
infraction--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i'm
saying
that,
when
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
never
even
considered
sending
it
to
the
administrator
because
there
would
be
no
reason
to
do
that.
they
didn't
ask
for
it.
this
isn't
one
of
those
cases,
where
there's
--
it's
a
medical
case,
where
you
need
new
evidentiary
hearings
on
whether
someone's
sick.
this
goes
to
justice
alito's
question
of
in
which
cases,
after
an
abuse
of
discretion,
are
courts
likely
to
defer?
that's
a
factor
where
they
are.
let
me
give
you
another
one.
if
you
have
a
minor
procedural
infraction
--
and
this
case
is
anything
but
--
the
disclosures
were
wrong
for
5
years,
and
contrary
to
mr.
long's
claim,
this
wasn't
missing
from
the
plan
for
3
months.
this
was
missing
from
the
plan
for--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--pages
--
pages
29a
and
30a
of
the
petition
appendix.
you
have
to
read
it
very
carefully,
and
i
know
this
stuff
is
boring,
and
i
apologize,
but
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
offset
was
reinserted.
it
was
in
1993,
in
section
1.45(f),
that
xerox
finally
put
the
offset
back.
here's
the
confusion.
they
keep
referring
to
this
1990
amendment.
the
1990
amendment,
which
is
invalid,
it
didn't
put
an
offset
back.
it
just
put
in
the
words
"phantom
account".
it
was
--
it
--
it
created
a
phantom
entitlement.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
it
put
in
the
words
'89
restatement.
if
you
look
in
--
at
section
1.35,
and
it's
in
the
joint
appendix.
it's

of
the
joint
appendix.
this
is
the
definition
of
"retirement
account".
this
is
the
account
that
actually
applies
to
my
clients.
there's
a
phantom
account
here.
there
has
always
been
the
phantom
account
in
the
plan.
they
removed
the
offset.
so
this
--
the
relevant
thing
is
the
offset,
and
it's
been
gone
for
5
years.
now,
to
get
back
to
this
deference
question
which
i
--
i
think
is
important
because
these
factors
matter.
let's
take
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
regularly
defers
after
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
u.s.
points
this
out
--
where
do
they
point
it
out
--
page
23
of
their
brief.
the
miller
v.
united
welfare
fund
case
out
of
the
second
circuit
does
precisely
what
xerox
says
the
second
circuit
overruled.
so,
unquestionably,
the
second
circuit
realized
that
it
could
defer,
but
it
chose
not
to
here.
this
wasn't
a
small
procedural
infraction.
this
wasn't
you
have
to
decide
in
30
days,
and
xerox
took
33
days
to
decide.
this
was
xerox
sending
personal
benefit
statements
to
people
for
5
years
that
said
you're
going
to
get
$2,000,
you
are
going
to
get
$3,000.
the
--
the
summary
plan
description
in
this
case,
it's
on
page
47a.
it
says
the
amount
you
receive
may
also
be
reduced
if
you
have
previously
left
the
company
and
received
a
distribution
at
that
time.
mr.
long
gets
up
here
--
and
i
understand
what
he's
saying
--
he
says,
we
have
to
disclose
everything
in
a
summary
plan
description?
how's
it
going
to
be
a
summary?
no,
we
suggest
that
you
have
to
say
there
is
going
to
be
some
appreciation.
you
have
to
do
something
to
suggest
to
average
plan
participants
that
there's
going
to
be
a
20
percent
interest
rate,
an
8.5
percent
interest
rate,
that
it's
going
to
apply
to
your
entire
distribution.
and
that's
what
the
lower
court
decided
here.
they
were
there;
they
saw
the
facts;
they
found
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
--
and
they
said:
you
know
what
--
in
this
rare
case
--
and
it
is
rare
in
the
second
circuit
--
they
said
in
this
rare
case,
because
of
this
particular
abuse
of
discretion
that
involves
the
same
issue,
that
involves
statutory
disclosure
violations,
that
involved
xerox
trying
to
pay
people
$5.31
a
month
when
they
told
them
they
were
paying
them
$2,300
a
month,
we're
not
going
to
defer.
and
they
went
the
extra
mile.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
of
course.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that's
true.
i
wouldn't
wish
it
upon
you.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
agree
with
you.
it
wouldn't
--
i
wasn't
suggesting
the
contrary.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
oh
--
ohh
--
here's
why
i
think
it's
--
i
was
unclear.
here's
why
i
think
that
is
important.
the
law
at
trust
law
was
that
there
is
a
bright-line
rule.
the
bright-line
rule
was,
once
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
the
court
gets
to
decide
will
you
continue
to
defer.
xerox
isn't
coming
before
you
and
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
abused
its
discretion
in
choosing
not
to
defer.
they're
advocating
a
bright-line
rule
that
says
a
court
must
defer
unless
there
is
a
finding
of
bad
faith.
and
so
my
point--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--no.
defer
means
if
it
was--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--oh,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
that's
flatly
not
happened
at
trust
law.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
the
government
cites
on
--
in
their
brief,
it's
pages
17
and
18.
they
cite
a
host
of
cases.
if
you
look
at
the
colton
case,
if
you
look
at
the
quote
directly
from
the
leading
bogert
treatise,
there
are
many
cases
like
this
one
where
the
court
said:
we're
not
going
to
give
you
a
second
chance.
we're
--
not
just
that
we
are
going
to
listen
to
you
and
not
--
and
not
give
you
deference
--
we're
going
to
listen
to
you
and
disagree;
we
are
not
going
to
listen
to
you.
and
that's
the
rule
that
we
and
the
government
are
advocating.
it
was
the
law
at
trust
law
and
out
of
fidelity
to
glenn
and
firestone.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
may
i
answer
that?
mr.
peter
k.
stris
okay.
i
didn't
want
to
be
presumptuous.
i
would
characterize
it
slightly
differently.
i
would
say
that
under
the
first
rule,
you
listen
and
if
you
think
it's
reasonable,
you
maybe
consider
as
a
factor
where
the
line
of
reasonableness
is,
but
you
reject
it.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i'm
saying
that
was
not
the
law,
that
has
never
been
the
law.
the
law
is,
once
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion,
the
court
has
the
right
to
say
we're
going
to
decide
for
ourselves,
we
are
going
to
decide
what's
reasonable,
and
if
you
characterize
that
as
not
listening
to
you--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
don't
think
it
would
ever
happen,
but
that's
how
it
worked
at
trust
law.
they
wouldn't
have
to.
but
i
think
courts
are
more
reasonable
than
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
