justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
there's
no--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
there's
no
bad
faith,
then
how
many
shots
does
the
plan
administrator
--
who
i
don't
think
is
named
sam
--
gets
to--
[laughter]
--to
try
to
answer
this
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
is
not
a
discretionary
decision
for
the
district
court
--
let's
assume
it's
not
a
discretionary
decision
for
the
--
for
the
administrator.
but
if
it's
--
and
if
it's
also
not
a
discretionary
decision
for
the
district
court,
if
what
the
district
court
is
required
to
do
is
to
say
what
the
plan
means,
what
would
you
suggest
that
the
district
court
should
have
looked
to,
when
the
--
the
provision,
the
--
the
plan
language
that
the
district
court
has
to
look
at
is
very
bare
bones?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
respondents
say
that
this
was
a
--
sure,
it's
a
--
a
benefit
to
them
to
be
--
to
have
this
offset
only
by
the
amount
that
they
received
and
not
take
into
account
the
time
value
of
money,
but
this
was
an
incentive
that
lured
them
into
accepting
employment
again
with
xerox.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
even
if
the
--
even
if
no
deference
was
owed
to
the
administrator,
could
you
explain
why
the
task
for
the
district
court
was
not
then
simply
to
interpret
what
the
plan
means?
what
puzzles
me
about
--
something
that
puzzles
me
about
the
--
the
two
decisions
by
the
second
circuit
are
(a)
why
this
is
remedial;
why
isn't
it
just
a
reinterpretation
of
the
plan;
(b)
where
their
--
what
do
equitable
principles
have
to
do
with
this;
and
why
should
it
be
a
discretionary
decision
for
the
district
court?
what
does
the
plan
mean?
that
would
be
the
issue.
isn't
that
the
question,
if
there's
no
deference
due
to
the
administrator?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
this
is
a
discretionary
decision
for
the
court
that
finds
the
initial
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
administrator,
what
are
the
factors
--
what
are
the
relevant
factors
in
determining
whether
the
administrator
should
get
a
second
shot
and
which
ones
are
present
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
i
don't
understand
what
the
purpose
of
the
remand
from
the
second
circuit
to
the
district
court,
after
the
second
circuit's
first
decision,
was.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
they
--
they
found
that
anything
other
than
an
offset
for
the
amount
of
money
that
was
actually
received
by
the
beneficiary
upon
leaving
xerox
would
be
--
would
violate
the
notice
requirements.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
that
interprets
the
plan.
there's
nothing
left
to
do,
then.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
that
the
concept
of
any
appreciation
of
that
amount
based
on
the
time
value
of
money
is
invalid,
because
there
wasn't
proper
notice
for
that.
so
there's
nothing
left
to
do
on
remand,
it
seems
to
me.
i
don't
understand
what
the
purpose
of
the
remand
was.
