mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
plan
administrator
has
abused
its
discretion
in
construing
plan
terms,
courts
are
not
required
to
defer
to
the
plan
administrator's
fallback
interpretation
of
the
same
terms.
that
rule
follows
from
trust
law,
and
a
contrary
rule
would
undermine
erisa's
protections
for
plan
participants.
it
would
reduce
incentives
for
administrators
to
interpret
plans
reasonably;
it
would
discourage
participants
from
challenging
unreasonable
benefit
denials;
and
it
would
make
employers
less
likely
to
draft
clear
plans.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
you
don't
think
it's
the
same
terms,
that
would
present
a
--
a
different
question
about
whether
deference
was
required.
but
still
deference
would
have
been
inappropriate
here,
because
the
fallback
interpretation
by
the
plan
administrator
presented
the
same
notice
problems
that
the
original
phantom
account
interpretation
had
provided,
because
the
summary
plan
description
didn't
provide
notice
that
there
would
be
an
appreciated
offset.
but
the
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
was
that
deference
was
not
required
when
it
was
the
same
terms,
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that.
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
--
in
resolving
that,
to
decide
whether
it
was
the
same
terms
here.
we
think
it
--
it
was,
because
the
--
the
petitioners
made
two
arguments
in
defending
their
initial
benefits
determination.
one
was
we
can
apply
the
post-1998
terms,
and
the
other
one
was,
even
applying
the
1989
plan,
that
authorizes
use
of
the
phantom
account,
because
of
the
non-duplication
of
benefits
provision.
and
now
they
have
come
back
on
remand
and
they're
saying
well,
no,
we're
now
reading
the
non-duplication
of
benefits
provision
differently.
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
same
plan
terms.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
we--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we
think
there
would
be
no
difference
on
b
if
it
was
just
a
second
reading
of
the
same
--
of
the
same
term.
under
that
logic--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--you
want
the
administrators
to
give
their
most
reasonable
interpretation,
but
under
the
logic
of
letting
them
be
able
to
put
the
first
interpretation
there,
they
could
just
put
a
list
of
10
interpretations--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--starting
with
the
one
that's
most
favorable.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
then
a
court
might
choose
to
defer
if
it
thought
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
a
reason
to
suspect
that
they're
just
trying--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
they
wouldn't
have
to
find
bad
faith.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
standard
would
be--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--ordinarily,
if
we
are
talking
about
they
have
put
forward
an
interpretation,
now
they
want
to
put
forward
a
fallback
interpretation,
generally,
if
--
generally,
if
they
have
--
haven't
put
that
forward
before,
we
think
that
deference
wouldn't
be
appropriate,
because
they
had
the
opportunity
to
address
the
issue,
and
the
unreasonableness
of
the
initial
interpretation
suggests
that
they
may
not
act
reasonably
on
remand.
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
according--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--according--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
right,
and
--
but
there
are
--
there
are
concerns
here
about
undermining
erisa's
protections
for
plan
participants
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
right.
because
erisa
requires
the
summary
plan
description
to
identify
any
circumstances
that
will
result
in
an
offset,
to
describe
the
offset
in
a
manner
calculated
to
be
understood
by
the
average
plan
participant,
and
not
to
minimize
the
significance
of
the
offset.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
don't--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
don't
know
that
the
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
found
that
the
first
time
around.
our
point
is
that
that
was
the
consequence
of
the
lack
of
notice
that
was
in
--
in
the
summary
plan
description.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
--
we
--
we
think
in
most
cases,
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
in
light
of
the
lack
of
notice
in
the
summary
plan
description
to
apply
an
appreciated
offset.
but
the
district
court
also
did
consider
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
plan
--
plan
participants,
and
there
might
have
been
other
countervailing
considerations
that
could
have
been
advanced
by
the
--
the
plan
administrator,
perhaps,
about
the
financial
solvency
of
the
plan
or
some
other
matters,
but
--
but
those
weren't
presented
here.
the
point
is
that,
once
the
court
--
when
the
court
remanded,
the
first
task
for
the
district
court
on
remand
was
to
look
at
the
plan
terms
because
this
was
a
benefit
action,
determine
whether
those
plan
terms
addressed
how
to
calculate
the
offset,
but
here,
the
court
couldn't
rely
on
the
plan
terms,
really,
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
the
district
court
said,
the
plan
said
virtually
nothing
about
how
to
do
it;
and,
second,
the
point
that
i
was
making
before,
erisa
prohibited
the
court
from
adopting
an
interpretation
that
provided
for
more
than
the
--
an
offset
greater
than
the
face
value.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
in
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--if
the
plan
--
if
the
plan
terms
--
in
an
ordinary
case,
if
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
interpreting
the
plan
terms,
the
plan
terms
would
still
address
the
issue.
there
wouldn't
be
an
additional
violation
of
erisa's
notice
requirement.
this
is
a
unique
case,
in
the
sense
that,
here,
you've
got
not
just
an
arbitrary
--
an
unreasonable
interpretation
of
the
plan
terms,
but
you've
also
got
the
problem
of
the
lack
of
notice
in
the
summary
plan
description,
and
you've
also
got
the
problem
that
the
plan
terms
are
really
silent
on
this
issue.
they
just
don't
say
anything
about
how
to
calculate
the
offset.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
it's
a
windfall,
your
honor,
because
it
depends
on
what
the
employees
were
promised
when
they
were
deciding
whether
to
come
back--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well
--
first
of
all,
when
you've
got
a
defined
benefit
plan
and
defined
contribution
plan,
there's
no
requirement
in
erisa,
and
employers
frequently
--
or
at
least,
sometimes,
would
not
offset
the
defined
contribution
benefits
from
the
defined
benefit
plan,
and
even
in
a
flooroffset
arrangement,
where
they
would,
an
employer
could
provide
less
than
the
full
amount--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--oh,
god.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
that's
essentially
--
that's
essentially
the
--
the
principle
that
we're
--
that
we're
talking
about--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
court's
not
required
to
apply
its
use
of
discretion
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--review
again.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
it's
--
i
think
any
responsible
district
court
would
--
would
do
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
they
would
do
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
of
course.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
think
that,
in
trust
law,
that
--
under
the
principles
of
trust
law,
that
mr.
stris
is
correct,
that
the
district
court
has
the
--
the
--
the
court
would
have
discretion
to
formulate
the
remedy
and
could
direct
the
trustee--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--in
a
benefits
action,
the
first
question
is
to
interpret
the
plan,
but
what
you
have
here
is
a
plan
that
is
silent
and
a
plan
that
--
where
interpreting
the
plan
to
provide
for
a
certain
kind
of
offset,
there
is
inadequate
notice
in
the
summary
plan
description,
so
there's
a
violation
of
erisa.
so,
in
this
circumstance,
not
ordinarily,
whenever
there's
a
misinterpretation
of
the
plan,
but
in
the
circumstances
here,
it
is
a
remedial
decision
because
the
court
has
to
fill
the
gap
in
the
plan
that's
the
result
of
the
silence
of
the
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
when
--
the
analogy
here
is
to
the
trust
law
situation,
where
trusts
--
where
--
where
courts
modify
the
terms
of
a
trust
because
the
terms
are
illegal
or
there's
a
change
of
circumstances,
like
the
cy
pres
doctrine.
