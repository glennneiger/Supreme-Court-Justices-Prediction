chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
number
08-810,
conkright
v.
frommert.
mr.
long.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
stris.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
i
could
switch
to
the
deference
point.
let's
say
you
have
an
administrator
who
says
i
interpret
this
particular
provision
to
mean
a;
and
he
says
but,
if
that's
rejected,
there
are
these
other
provisions
that
should
be
read
to
mean
b.
that
goes
up;
the
court
--
the
rejects
a.
does
the
administrator
get
deference
on
his
reading
of
the
other
provisions
b?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
it's
kind
of
odd
to
say
to
the
administrator:
look,
if
you
want
discretion,
you
should
make
as
many
rulings
as
you
can
possibly
think
of
because
then
you'll
get
discretion
as
to
each
of
them.
but
if
you
only
do
what's
efficient
and
say
here's
how
i
read
it,
then
you
don't
get
any
discretion
at
all
on
the
other
provisions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
it's
not
just
that
they
abused
their
discretion;
they're
discretion
abusers?
you
can't
trust
them
on
the
next
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
do
that
with
the
district
court.
we
get
a
district
court,
and
we
use
all
of
these
pejorative
terms
--
"abuse
of
discretion",
"arbitrary
and
capricious",
"clear
error"
--
and
we
send
it
back
for
them
to
do
the
same
--
you
know,
they
make--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they're
the
fact
finder.
here,
the
plan
administrator
is
the
primary
interpreter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
what's
the
relevant
principle?
isn't
it
what
the
lump
sum
was
that
he
took
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
chose
to
take
it
out
of
that
plan,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
since
that's
a
fairly
stark
disagreement
among
counsel
on
a
factual
matter,
where
in
the
record
do
you
see
5
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
put
in
the
words
"phantom
account"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
defer
doesn't
mean
uphold
in
every
circumstance,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
well,
then
i
don't
think
it's
proper
to
say
they
can
choose
not
to
defer.
they
can
defer
and
--
and
choose
to
find
it's
still
an
abuse
of
discretion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
so
i
understand,
there
are
two
different
views.
one
is
we
are
going
to
listen
to
you,
and
we
may
not
agree
with
you.
and
the
other
is
we're
not
even
going
to
listen
to
you.
and
you
are
arguing
for
the
second
rule.
you
think
the
proper
way
to
approach
this
is
saying
we
don't
care,
plan
administrator,
what
you
think.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
don't
even
need
to
accept
a
brief
from
the
plan
administrator--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
hypothetical
i
asked
your
friend?
you
know,
this
is
how
we
read
the
provision,
reading
a,
and
we
recognize
there's
some
ambiguity
there,
and
if
a
court
disagrees
with
it,
our
--
our
second
reading
is
--
is
b.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
deference
on
b?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
that
make
sense?
i
mean,
don't
you
want
the
administrators
to
give
you
their
best
--
best
understanding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
they
can--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they
can
--
they
can
take
it
to
the
extreme.
but
if
it
looks
like
a
good
faith
effort,
to
say
--
you
know,
it's
tough
to
interpret
and
administer
these
plans,
and
they
say,
this
is
what
we
think
it
means,
but
we're
human;
maybe
we
made
a
mistake.
and
this
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
one
strike
and
you're
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
that's
assuming,
it
seems
to
me
--
it
makes
sense
if
there's
bad
faith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
you
make
fallback
arguments.
you're
here
and
say
this
is
how
we
read
this,
but
if
you
don't
agree
with
it,
this
is
how
we
read
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
you
disagree
with
mr.
stris.
do
you
think
the
district
court
should
listen
to
what
the
plan
administrator
has
to
say?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
thank
you.
mr.
long,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-810,
conkright
versus
frommert.
this
is
a
case
arising
under
a
federal
law
known
as
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
or
erisa.
that
law
governs
pension
plans;
under
erisa,
the
companies
setting
up
such
a
plan
can
specify
that
the
administrator
of
the
plan
has
discretion
to
interpret
its
terms.
in
such
a
case,
the
court
construing
the
plan
must
defer
to
the
administrator's
interpretation
as
long
as
it
is
reasonable.
now
here
the
lower
courts
determined
that
the
administrator's
interpretation
of
a
plan
provision
was
unreasonable
and
they
explained
the
basis
for
that
decision.
the
question
is
whether
the
courts
should
go
ahead
and
decide
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
plan
on
their
own,
how
the
plan
should
be
read
once
the
erroneous
interpretation
is
taken
out
of
the
plan
or
whether
the
issue
should
go
back
to
the
administrator
to
exercise
his
discretion
anew,
now
that
he
has
been
told
what
was
wrong
with
his
original
interpretation.
so
in
other
words,
is
the
rule
one
strike
and
you're
out
or
try
again,
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
rule
is
for
the
administrator
to
try
again.
we
think
such
an
approach
is
more
consistent
with
the
principles
that
cause
us
to
defer
to
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
administrators
in
the
first
place.
now
of
course,
if
there
are
signs
of
bad
faith
or
an
administrator
just
keeps
adopting
unreasonable
interpretation,
courts
will
not
have
to
defer
but
one
honest
mistake
should
not
mean
that
courts
can
take
over
the
administrator's
job.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
it
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justices
scalia,
kennedy,
thomas
and
alito
joined
the
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
