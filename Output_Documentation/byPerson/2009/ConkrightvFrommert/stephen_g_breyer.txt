justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
sg
says
that
isn't
trust
law.
the
sg
says
that
trust
law
--
when
you
make
a
mistake
and
you
send
it
back,
that
the
district
judge
has
a
choice
here,
which
would
make
sense.
the
district
judge,
if
he
thinks
he's
going
to
get
something
out
of
the
trust
--
the
administrator,
listens
to
him.
i
mean,
it
sounds
like
common
sense
would
be:
listen
to
the
administrator,
but
you
don't
have
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
it's
very
complicated.
he
may
understand
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
is
she
wrong?
you're
saying
if
i
look
at
those
cases,
i'll
find--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
not
--
it's
not
a
standard
of
review.
it's
--
he's
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
word
"duplicative"
means,
okay?
and
the
--
and
the
administrator
did
his
best.
he
says
it
means
what
it
meant
before,
which
is,
like,
14
pages
of
who-could-understand-it.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
it
turns
out
that
that
isn't
what
it
means,
and
the
district
judge
says:
that's
affirmed.
so
now
he
says:
give
me
another
shot.
if
it
were
me,
i'd
listen,
but
if
i
thought
this
isn't
really
that
great,
i
would
try
to
figure
out
something
else.
and
then
if
i
were
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
i'd
say
it's
up
to
the
district
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
luckily,
the
sg
says
that
is
the
law.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
says
it
isn't
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
just
that?
he
came
back,
the
administrator,
i
think,
the
second
time,
with
something
that
very
closely
resembled
the
first
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
about
that
for
a
reason
thinking
he's
not
in
that
good
of
faith?
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
--
it
struck
me
if
--
it's
hard.
i
don't
necessarily
follow
it
at
all,
but
the
--
you
had
this
original
plan
where,
basically,
you
were
trying
to
figure
out
how
much
money
they
took
away,
and
you
compared
it
with
what
it
would
have
made
if
you
had
invested
it
in
certain
funds.
so
now
we
have
a
new
word,
which
is
called
"duplicative";
you
can't
be
duplicative,
something
like
that.
and
then
the
second
circuit
says
that
new
word
called
"duplicative"
for
new
plans
doesn't
really
pick
up
this
old
phantom
system;
at
least,
it
doesn't
give
notice.
now
he
sends
it
back,
and
the
poor
district
judge,
since
he
thought
that
was
perfectly
sensible
to
say
it
did
pick
that
up,
says:
well,
they
told
me
it
didn't,
so
i'll
ask
the
administrator
what
do
you
think
we
do
now?
the
administrator
says:
i
have
a
great
idea;
the
plain
vanilla
system.
the
plain
vanilla
system
happens
to
be
very
much
like
the
old
system,
except
in
following
your
own
funds,
you're
not
doing
it;
you're
following
the
--
the
insurance
industry's
funds.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
i
mean,
that's
--
it's
what
they'll
pay
for
an
annuity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
called
--
that's
called
their
funds.
that's
called
what
they
think
they'll
earn.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
correct,
and
the
question
is:
what
is
attributable
to?
and
they
struck
down
your
phantom
system
for
doing
it,
and
then
the
administrator
comes
back
with
a
new
system,
which
new
system
is
going
to
take
the
judgment
of
the
insurance
companies
about
what
was
accrued.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
and
then
what
he's
thinking
is
that's
awfully
similar.
we
just
substituted
different
people
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
similar
in
a
sense,
and
it's
different
in
a
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
--
the
more
you
hypothetically
grow
it,
the
less
chance
they'll
get
the
floor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
they'd
like
it
to
get
the
floor,
and
so
they'd
like
it
to
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
up
until
this
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why
--
as
i
understand
it
--
which
big
if
--
you
and
i
are
both
working
at
xerox,
and
in
year
1
--
and
we
each
have
500,000
in
our
contribution
account,
and
you
leave,
and
you
take
the
500,000.
i
stay,
and
i
don't.
okay?
now,
my
500,000
over
the
next
10
years
is
going
to
grow
somewhat
--
as
long
as
it
wasn't
2007.
but
it--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
might
spend
it,
but
if
i
leave
it
there,
it
would
grow,
okay.
but
some
--
some
people
leave
it
there,
they
grow.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
when
figuring
the
floor,
what
xerox
does
is
look
to
see
how
much
it
grew.
they
look
at
the
whole
thing,
now,
10
years
later,
and
they
say,
you're
up
above
the
floor,
good-bye,
we
will
give
you
this,
not
the
floor,
okay.
now,
you
are
in
the
same
position,
and
you
happen
to
come
back
to
xerox,
and
all
they
want
to
do
is
say,
you
know,
we'd
like
to
assume
yours
grew,
too,
i
mean,
not
--
a
little,
anyway,
and
the
first
thing
they
wanted
to
do
is
to
say
it
should
have
grown
the
same
way
we
treat
our
own
guys,
as
it
having
grown.
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
that's
wrong
because
you
left
the
words
out,
but
send
it
back
to
see
it's
fair.
so
then
the
expert
comes
in,
and
the
expert
says,
well,
they
didn't
want
to
give
us
that
way
to
grow
it;
here
is
how
--
we
will
assume
it
grew
like
an
insurance
company,
the
most
incredibly
conservative
people
in
the
world,
how
--
how
they
would
have
treated
it
as
growing,
if
you
bought
an
annuity
right
then,
and
that
just
gives
us
even
a
lower
number.
and
--
and
they
want
to
say,
why
didn't
you
at
least
listen
to
that,
instead
of
coming
to
the
fact
which
is
very,
very
unusual,
it
didn't
grow
at
all,
in
which
case,
you
are
eligible
for
the
floor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
think
that's
why
they
think
it's
either
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
you
should
have
listened
more
to
the
--
to
the
expert
--
should
have
done
something
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
pretty
big
windfall
for
people.
you're
working
at
xerox,
and
your
plan
is
about
approaching
the
minimum
level
--
let's
quit
and
then
go
invest
it,
and
then
come
back
3
days
before
you're
bound
to
retire,
and
then
you're
going
get
whatever
the
plan
grew,
and
you'll
also
get
your
minimum.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
would
anyone
promise
them
that
kind
of
a
deal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
--
a
bit
more
serious
question
--
i
mean,
that
is
a
serious
question,
but
the
more
general
question,
what
about
something
that
is
analogous
to
skidmore
deference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
say--
[laughter]
you
say
--
you
take
the
--
the
district
judge
here
can
take
--
takes
the
administrator's
opinion
for
what
it's
worth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
has
to
listen
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
essentially
the
principle,
i
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
does
have
to
read
it.
he
has
to
read
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--read
it,
and
take
it
for
what
it's
worth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
think
they
would
--
you
think
they
would
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
