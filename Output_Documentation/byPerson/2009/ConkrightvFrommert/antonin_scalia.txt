justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
--
but
when
the
administrator
has
interpreted
the
plan
incorrectly
and
the
court
finds
--
the
court
of
appeals
finds
that
he
has
interpreted
it
incorrectly,
it
doesn't
have
to
send
it
back
and
say,
you
know:
give
me
another
bid;
try
something
else.
it
says:
you
did
it
incorrectly,
and
we
find
that
what
you
should
have
done
is
this.
isn't
that
what
normally
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
a
court
can
do
in
those
trust
cases
is
to
say:
you've
got
it
wrong,
sam;
go
back
and
do
it
again.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
gets
it
wrong
again,
and
he
goes
back
to
court;
the
court
says:
sam,
it's
still
wrong;
go
back
and
do
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
believe
that
that's
what
the
law
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
--
this
is
important
to
me,
whether
the
plan
administrator
was
interpreting
the
same
language
when
this
case
was
remanded
back
down.
originally,
he
was
simply
applying
the
methodology
that
had
been
specified
in
1990,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
court
said
that
was
no
good
because
you
didn't
give
these
people
notice
of
it.
but
that
--
he
had
been
applying
that
test
not
since
1990,
but
since
1980.
in
other
words,
he
had
taken
that
to
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
very
summary
language
in
--
in
the
plan
itself,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when
it
went
back,
why
didn't
he
stick
with
that
and
say:
yes,
they
didn't
have
adequate
notice
of
that,
but
that
is
still
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
original
plan,
even
before
we
specified
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
why
did
he
do
that?
inasmuch
as
the
first
interpretation
was
not
adopted
in
1990,
but
it
was
adopted
under
the
same
language
that
he
is
now
interpreting
in
1980,
right?
he
was
applying
it
between
1980
and
1990.
that's
what
he
thought
he
--
that's
what
he
thought
the
plan
meant
in
all
those
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
after
1990.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
didn't
understand.
i
didn't
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
your
--
your
brief
says:
"the
plan
administrator
has
consistently
applied
the
reconstructed
account
methodology
since
the
early
'80s.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
'90>
["]
--
"1990,
the
plan
language
requiring
this
methodology
provided
as
follows.
"
so
i
took
that
to
mean
there
was
no
such
language
before
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
plan
language
requiring
it
before
1990.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that's
--
that's
what
i
thought,
and
i
thought
you
said
no
when
i
asked
that
question,
that
this
detailed
description
of
the
ram
didn't
come
in
until
1990.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh
--
oh,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
claim
--
you
claim
that
what
he
is
interpreting
when
it
comes
back
to
him
is
not
the
same
text
that
they
invalidated--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
rather
it's
the
plan
without
this
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
of
appeals
said
it's
just
an
application
of
equitable
principles--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
an
interpretation
of
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
--
well,
i
thought
you
said
what
this
affects
is
just
the
floor;
it
doesn't
affect
the
level
of
the
--
of
the
defined
contribution.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
same
question.
when
the
court
has
held
that
1
and
2
was,
in
effect,
not
in
the
contract
because
you
didn't
give
enough
notice
of
it.
so
now
you
have
a
contract
without
1
and
2
in
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
a
different
question.
what
does
this
contract
mean
without
1
and
2?
now,
you
may
have
a
different
point,
if
--
if
you
say
that
what
--
and
it
seems
to
me
you
did
say
this,
that
the
court
of
appeal
--
the
court
of
appeals,
not
only
decided
that
there
was
no
notice
and,
therefore,
this
provision
wasn't
any
good,
but
you
claim
that
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
that
you
cannot
account
for
the
time
value
of
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
now,
that
would
be
a
totally
different
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
didn't
read
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
little
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
are
you
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals
sending
it
back
to
the
district
court,
or
are
you
talking
about
the
district
court
sending
it
back
to
the
administrator?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can
handle
those
facts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
can
handle
those
facts
just
as
easily
as
the
district
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
--
we
don't
have
to
look
at
the
witness's
demeanor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
just
because
a
decision
has
some
factual
basis
--
every
decision
has
some
factual
basis.
that
doesn't
mean
that
--
that
an
appellate
court,
including
this
one,
can't
decide
the
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
keep
stressing
that
--
you
know,
the
district
court
was
there
and
saw
these
facts?
that's
fine--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
don't
think
it's
the
same
terms?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
in
principle,
if
--
if
we
accept
your
argument,
if
other
retirees
who
are
later
rehired
bring
a
lawsuit
in
another
court,
you
might
have
a
different
result
because
it
would
be
up
to
the
--
up
to
that
court
to
decide
what
was
--
what
was
a
proper
result,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
consequence
of
not
deferring
to
the
plan
administrator.
you
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
we
go
back
to
the
urns?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
interpret
gaps
in
--
in
documents
all
the
time.
that's
part
of
interpreting
a
document,
figuring
out
what
it
provides
for
in
a
lot
of
situations
that
it
does
not
explicitly
cover.
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
interpreting
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
one
was
inadequate
because
it
did
not
say
that
you
were
going
to
take
into
account
the
time
value
of
money.
if
that's
the
reason
it
held
that
this
one
was
bad,
the
same
reason
would
apply
to
the
plain
vanilla.
