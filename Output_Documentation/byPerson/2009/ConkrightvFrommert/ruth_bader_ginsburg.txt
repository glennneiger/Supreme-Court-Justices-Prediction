mr.
long,
we're
talking
in
the
abstract--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--referring
to
scott,
but
--
that
this
case
--
what
i
took
away
from
the
second
circuit's
opinion
was
the
flaw
here
was
not
that
the
method
was
no
good
if
you
had
adequate
notice;
the
flaw
was
the
people
affected
were
not
told
in
what
is
the
language
of
erisa,
in
plain,
simple
language,
what
their
entitlement
was.
and
that's
--
that's
the
problem,
not
that
this
method
wasn't
perfectly
satisfactory
if
you
gave
everybody
notice.
but
the
second
circuit
said,
you
didn't
give
them
notice.
either
it
said
nothing
or
it
was
totally
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
--
if
there
were
information,
but
the
--
the
erisa
provision
says
that
you
are
supposed
to
give
the
summary
description
of
the
plan
"in
a
manner
calculated
to
be
understood
by
the
average
plan
participant.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
all
that
the
1989
statement
said
was
the
amount
the
employees
received
may
be
reduced,
if
they
previously
left
the
company
and
received
a
distribution
at
that
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
where
is
it
--
what
--
what
was
in
the
summary
plan
description
on
this
point
between
1980
and
1990,
where
is
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
so
there
was
no
description
of
this
in
the
summary
plan
description?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
it
--
but
what
period?
between
1980
and
1990
or
the
3-month
period--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
talking
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
seem
to
be
rearguing
the
--
i
thought
that
the
--
i
thought
that
you
had
surrendered
on
--
what
is
it
called?
frommert
i.
that
--
that
the
second
circuit
said:
what
you
had
was
no
good,
because
it
violated
the
notice
provision
and
it
violated
the
anti-cutback
provision.
so
that's
what
they
call
a
phantom--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--account.
it's
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
out.
but
you
seem
to
now
be
telling
us
that
was
really
a
wrong
decision
on
the
second
circuit's
part,
that
there
was
--
that
it
was
perfectly
good,
that
it
was
described
in
the
plan
itself,
although
not
in
the
summary
plan
description.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
--
how
does
it
hurt
the
current
employees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
they
--
they
don't
get
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
some
kind
of
equal
protection,
that
another
worker
will
say:
i
didn't
get
that
boon
that
my--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there's
no
--
no
--
nothing
--
no
deduction
from
the
current
workforce.
they're
getting
what
the
plan
said
all
along
is
the
right
calculation
of
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
i
thought
you
said
in
this
--
in
this
case
--
and
we're
only
dealing
with
this
case
--
there
was
the
same
basic
problem,
the
same
flaw
in
the
second
interpretation.
and
you
said
in
both
cases,
they
wouldn't
satisfy
erisa's
notice
requirement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
--
is
it
--
mr.
roberts,
is
it
a
remedy?
so
that's
--
one
thing
is
you
can
view
this
as
the
district
court
as
substitute
interpreter
of
the
plan,
or
another
way
you
can
look
at
it
is
to
say,
the
--
the
benefit
determination
was
wrong,
we
reject
it,
the
court
rejects
it.
so,
now,
there
is
a
remedy
for
that
wrongful
determination.
so
is
this,
what's
going
on
in
the
district
court,
an
interpretation
of
the
plan
or
a
remedy
for
a
wrongful
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
long,
would
you
--
would
you
explain
your
position
on
the
picture
we
were
given
of
these
people
who
were
rehired
and
--
and
they
get,
periodically,
a
statement
that
says,
you
are
going
to
get
2,000-some-odd
dollars;
and
then,
5
years
later,
they
get
a
statement
that
says,
no,
it's
only
$5.18,
or
something
like
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
not
even
about
why
--
why
it
was
$5.
it's
why
did
he
get
notices
that
gave
him
the
perception
he
was
going
to
get
over
2,000
when
it
was
so
much
less?
