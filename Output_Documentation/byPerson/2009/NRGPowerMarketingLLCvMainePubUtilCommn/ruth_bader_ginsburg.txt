mr.
lamken,
you're
not
a
challenger?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
question
relates
to
the
other
side--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
to
his
side--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
course,
there
is.
what's
--
what's
really
lurking
behind
this
case
is
whether
this
is
a
contract
rate,
and
there
ferc
disagrees
with
you,
i
take
it.
you
were
talking
about
that
the
rate
that
emerges
from
a
contract
between
two
people
--
nobody
else
is
party
to
it,
but
you
say
the
rate
stands;
ferc
cannot
abrogate
the
rate;
nobody
can
ask
ferc
to
abrogate
that
bilateral
contract
rate.
but
here
we're
not
talking
about
a
bilateral
contract,
where
how
many
people
were
involved
in
the
settlement?
well
over
a
hundred.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
quite
a
different
picture
than
the
bilateral
contracts
that
were
at
issue
in
sierra
and
mobile.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
of
appeals
never
got
to
what
ferc
thinks
is
the
heart
of
the
case,
whether
this
is
a
contract
rate,
whether
--
you
say
it
is
not
--
and
whether
ferc
has
the
authority
nonetheless
to
apply
the
public
interest
standard.
but
none
of
those
have
been
addressed
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
their
simple
question
was
mobile-sierra
binds
the
contracting
parties,
and
it
doesn't
--
the
rate
doesn't
stick
for
anybody
else.
that's
all
they
decided.
and
the
question
that
you're
asking
certainly
is
looming
over
this
whole
case,
but
it
isn't
presented
to
us
because
it
wasn't
even
dealt
with
in
any
way,
shape,
or
manner
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
one
large
difference
--
i
thought
justice
scalia
suggested
that
the
rate
negotiated
by
--
in
that
bilateral
agreement,
that
that
rate
would
not
be
subject
to
just
and
reasonable
attack
by
anyone,
that
the
public
interest
standard
attaches
to
that
rate
and
ferc
can't
abrogate
it.
it's
a
rate
that's
set,
it's
binding
on
ferc,
and
ferc
presumably,
because
it
has
no
authority
to
abrogate
it,
could
not
entertain
any
complaint
that
would
ask
to
have
it
abrogated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
follow.
i
didn't
think
there
was
--
was
there
a
memphis
clause
in
this
settlement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
shouldn't
we
tell
them
that,
and
then
they
can
pick
it
up
from
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
what
they
did
say
could
be
--
have
heavy
consequences.
we
know
that
that
has
already
happened.
ferc
has
revised
a
number
of
contracts
to
conform
to
the
d.c.
circuit's
idea
that
it's
the
parties
to
the
--
to
the
contract,
not
the
rate
that's
sheltered
by
mobile-sierra.
that's
a
very
consequential
decision,
and
so
we
would
tell
the
d.c.
circuit,
if
we
agreed
with
ferc
and
the
petitioners
on
that:
d.c.
circuit,
you've
got
that
wrong.
now,
there
may
be
other
matters,
other
issues
like
the
ones
that
you
would
like
us
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
first
view,
but
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out
more
than
once,
we
have
a
question.
it
is
the
very
question
that
the
d.c.
circuit
decided.
why
should
we
go
beyond
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
third
standard
between
just
and
reasonable
and
public
interest?
you
want
us
to
add
another
tier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
defending
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision?
i
mean,
you
are
up
here
saying
that
was
the
right
judgment,
sierra-mobile
--
mobile-sierra
has
to
do
with
the
two
contracting
parties.
it
doesn't,
as
the
counterargument
goes,
shelter
the
rate
from
any
attack
by
anyone,
including
ferc.
it's
put
in
terms
of
ferc
cannot
abrogate
that
rate.
but
your
--
you
are
defending
the
position
that
it's
just
as
between
the
contracting
parties;
it's
not
the
rate
itself
that
is
sheltered
by
mobile-sierra,
because
that's
what
the
d.c.
circuit
decided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine
named
for
two
over
half-century
old
decisions
of
this
court,
concerns
superintendents
of
power
rate
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
this
case
is
about
the
dimensions
of
that
doctrine.
when
an
electricity
rate
is
set
by
freely
negotiated
wholesale
energy
contracts.
mobile-sierra
instructs,
the
commission
is
to
presume
that
the
rate
qualifies
as
just
reasonable
under
the
federal
power
act.
the
presumption
may
be
overcome
however,
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
rate
seriously
harms
the
public
interest.
for
many
years
new
england
supply
of
electricity
capacity
was
barely
sufficient
to
meet
the
region's
demand.
the
federal
commission
and
new
england's
generators,
electricity
providers
and
power
customers,
made
several
attempts
to
address
the
problem,
this
case
stems
from
the
latest
effort
to
design
the
solution.
concerned
parties
negotiated
a
comprehensive
settlement
agreement,
their
accord,
which
the
commission
approved,
established
rate-setting
mechanisms,
for
sales
of
energy
capacity,
and
provided
that
the
mobile-sierra
public
interest
standards
would
govern
rate
changes.
objectors
to
the
settlement
sought
review
in
the
dc
circuit.
by
and
large,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
commission's
order
but
it
agreed
with
the
objectors
on
the
point
here
at
issue.
when
the
contract
rate
is
challenged
by
non-cut
contacting
third
parties,
the
court
held,
the
mobile-sierra
presumption
that
the
rate
is
just
and
reasonable
does
not
apply.
we
reverse
that
determination.
mobile-sierra's
public
interest
standard
we
hold,
applies
to
all
challenges,
to
contract
rates
whether
initiated
by
contracting
parties
or
non
contracting
parties.
for
this
conclusion,
we
rely
heavily
on
this
court's
2008
morgan
stanley
decision,
which
we
announced
three
months
after
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
in
the
instant
case.
morgan
stanley
makes
it
unmistakably
clear
that
mobile-sierra's
public
interest
standard
is
not
as
the
dc
circuit
suggested
independent
of
and
sometimes
at
odds
with
the
just-and-reasonable
standard,
rather
the
public
interest
standard
defines
what
it
means
a
rate
to
satisfy
the
just-and-reasonable
standard
in
the
contract
context.
we
state
three
principal
reasons
for
our
opinion,
first
if
the
commission
itself
as
adjudicator
of
great
challenges
must
presume
that
contract
rates
resulting
from
fair
arms
length
negotiations
are
just
unreasonable
and
how
can
non-contracting
parties
escape
that
presumption.
second,
mobile-sierra
as
take
account
of
third-party
interest
where
the
doctrine
directs
the
commission
to
reject
the
contract
rate
that
seriously
harms
the
consuming
public.
most
critically,
the
dc
circuit's
confinement
of
mobile-sierra
to
challenges
by
contracting
parties
defeats
the
doctrine's
animating
purpose,
promotion
of
the
stability
of
supply
arrangements
which
all
agree
is
essential
to
the
health
of
the
energy
industry.
a
presumption
applicable
to
contracting
parties
but
inapplicable
to
all
others
who
might
challenge
a
contract
rate
could
scarcely
provide
the
stability
mobile-sierra
aimed
to
secure.
whether
the
rates
at
issue
qualify
as
contract
rates
for
mobile-sierra
purposes,
and,
if
not,
whether
the
commission
had
discretion
to
treat
them
analogously,
our
question
is
left
open
for
the
dc
circuit's
consideration
on
remand.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
