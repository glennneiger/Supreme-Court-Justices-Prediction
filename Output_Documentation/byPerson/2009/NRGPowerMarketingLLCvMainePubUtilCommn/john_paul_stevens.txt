could
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
--
of
a
challenge
to
a
rate
that's
set
under
this
whole
program
that
would
succeed
under
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
and
fail
under
the
public
interest
standard,
or
vice
versa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
answers
my
question.
could
there
be
--
could
there
be
a
rate
that
would
violate
one
standard
and
not
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
is
your
view,
is
it
not,
that
the
rates
that
result
from
the
auction
are
not
contract
rates
within
the
meaning
of
mobile-sierra?
