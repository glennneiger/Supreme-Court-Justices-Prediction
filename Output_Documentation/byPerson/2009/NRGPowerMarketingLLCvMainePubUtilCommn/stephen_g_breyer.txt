justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
case
in
which,
as
i
think
most
cases
where
they
approve
contracts,
what
they're
finding
is
that
the
contract
rate
in
this
circumstance,
or
here
the
settlement
rate
in
this
circumstance,
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
because.
all
right?
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
i
mean,
are
you
going
to
say
he's
wrong,
the
lower
court's
wrong,
because
they
got
the
whole
thing
mixed
up.
i
mean
--
could
we
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
if
we
were
to
do
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
would
--
would
you
agree
with
my
assumptions
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
what
this
case
is
about
--
and
it's
a
fortiori
from
the
ordinary
contract
case
--
is
that
sometimes
an
agency,
because
of
particular
economic
circumstances,
concludes
that
a
particular
rate-setting
system
is
a
just
and
reasonable
system,
and
once
that's
in
place,
then
as
part
of
that
system
is
the
rule
you
can
only
challenge
it
when
it
violates
the
public
interest,
for
example.
now,
you
can
go
and
attack
the
whole
business
on
the
ground
the
whole
business
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
it
departs
from
the
statute.
but
if
the
whole
business
is
okay,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
have
i
just
said
the
correct
law
in
your
view
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
not
interested
in
if
you
have
a
back-up
or
not.
i'm
interested
in,
is
it
correct
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
can
we?
i
mean,
that's
a
--
why
not
answer
a
case
--
a
question
about
employment
discrimination
law?
where
--
where
in
this
ferc
thing
does
this
say
that
these
are
contracts
of
a
kind
that
mobile-sierra
was
about?
i
mean,
i
don't
even
know
if
mobile-sierra
--
whether
you
could
--
a
third
party
could
attack
such
a
contract
under
public
--
under
a
just
and
reasonable
standard,
unless
i
knew
first
what
the
commission
thought
about
it
in
this
context,
because
then
the
commission's
question
would
be:
is
that
a
reasonable
view?
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
would
have
to
take
it
on
the
assumption
--
wait,
i
don't
want
--
you
have
5
minutes
left
that
you're
reserving?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
assumption?
the
assumption
is
the
court
of
appeals
thinks
that
the
contract
between
--
among
the
generating
--
the
generators,
that
that
is
a
mobile-sierra
contract.
so
we're
supposed
to
say,
if
that
were
a
mobile-sierra
contract,
which
it
isn't,
then
we
should
decide
whether
a
third
party
could
attack
it,
about
which
the
commission
has
said
nothing.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
transition
rates?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
reasonableness
depends
upon
the
other.
the
validity
depends
upon
the
other.
it's
all
part
of
a
package.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
true,
but
i
would
want
to
know
what
the
commission
thought
about
that
one,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
are
you
powerless?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
you
to
go
to
the
commission
and
say:
commission,
there
is
always
special
circumstances.
you
may
think
that
in
this
kind
of
situation,
which
is
a
special
situation,
that
the
public
interest
standard,
whether
it's
in
a
contract
or
whether
it's
in
a
tariff
or
wherever
you
want
to
put
it,
is
the
right
standard
for
review.
you
may
think
that.
but
you
don't
think
it
for
yourselves,
you
don't
think
it
for
somebody
else,
and
here's
some
reasons
why
you
don't
think
it
for
us.
and
if
they
agree
with
your
reasons,
they'll
say:
fine,
go
ahead.
and
if
they
don't,
they
don't.
why
aren't
you
exactly
as
powerful
or
powerless
as
anybody
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
point
is
if
you
don't
like
that
as
applied
to
your
situation,
you
have
a
remedy.
that's
what
the
public
--
that's
why
they're
there,
agencies.
they
are
there
to
listen
to
you
and
give
you
a
remedy,
and
the
remedy
is,
if
you
convince
them
you
shouldn't
be
subject
to
that,
they'll
say
fine;
and
otherwise
not.
why
are
you
coming
to
us
who
know
nothing
about
natural
gas
and
asking
us
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
electricity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you're
going
to
say
you
mean
they
never
can
do
it,
but
it's
well
settled.
it's
well
settled
that
they
sometimes
can
say
--
i
mean,
my
point
is
this:
i
just
found
the
quote
i
was
looking
for.
so
i
was
thinking
natural
gas.
it
applies
to
electricity
capacity,
too.
justice
jackson:
"the
wealth
of
midas
and
the
wit
of
man
cannot
produce
or
reproduce
a
natural
gas
field.
"
that
applies
to
electricity
capacity.
we
can't
reproduce
it.
you
can't.
the
commission
devises
a
system
for
trying
to
get
it
done,
and
if
they
do
it
reasonably,
they
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
standard
--
the
statute
is
"just
and
reasonable".
that
calls
up
a
whole
mechanism
from
the
1930s.
i
thought
that
it
is
long
--
we're
long
past
that
point,
that
--
that
whatever
brandeis
thought
it
was,
which
they
did
in
the
thirties
and
forties,
that
it
has
also
been
interpreted
to
include
the
power
to
the
commission
to
deviate
from
that,
because
they
find,
for
example,
contract
rates
under
certain
circumstances
to
be
just
and
reasonable,
even
though
you
don't
use
cost-of-service
ratemaking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
the
answer
then
maybe
where
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
scalia
were
going,
that
--
because
where
i'm
coming
from,
why
i
have
been
asking
this,
is
i
actually
think
the
answer
to
the
question
so
far
on
the
question
presented
is
"sometimes".
sometimes
you
can't;
sometimes
you
can.
and
it
depends
on
a
lot
of
things
--
situations,
circumstances,
arguments
to
commissions,
what
they
held,
et
cetera.
so
maybe
that's
the
thing
to
do,
you
answer
the
question,
say
"sometimes".
sometimes
they
can
use
one;
sometimes
it's
the
other.
indeed,
in
this
very
case,
they've
argued
that
it's
--
that
it's
not
even
within
the
mainstream
of
mobile-sierra.
and
maybe
that's
so,
maybe
not.
send
it
back,
say
it
depends
on
circumstances,
time,
et
cetera.
and
then
they
can
argue
all
these
things
out
that
we've
just
been
hearing.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
are
you
aware
of
any
law
or
any
statement
by
any
judge,
ever,
that
exempts
the
--
the
ferc
from
the
basic
requirement
that
its
rules,
regulations,
and
everything
else
not
be
arbitrary,
capricious,
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
okay.
thank
you.
[laughter]
and
so,
as
long
as
that's
so,
i
guess
you
could
mount
a
challenge
on
the
ground
that
to
apply
the
contract
regime
system
to
circumstance
x,
y,
and
z,
without
permitting
your
challenge
that
you
want,
is,
in
fact,
a
violation
of
the
apa,
at
the
least.
okay?
now,
that's
why
i
say
"sometimes".
could
you
imagine
such
a
situation,
which
i
think
is
what
justice
sotomayor
was
getting
at,
or
do
you
want
it
all
the
time?
if
you
want
it
all
the
time,
i'm
not
--
you're
not
getting
sympathy
from
me.
if
want
to
say
there
could
be
such
a
time,
maybe.
i
think
i
could
think
of
five.
all
right?
so
--
so
where
are
we?
