mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
a
bedrock
principle
of
federal
--
federal
energy
law,
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine.
the
question
presented
and
the
issue
decided
below
is
whether
mobile-sierra's
public
interest
standard
ceases
to
apply
whenever
a
contract
rate
is
challenged
by
a
noncontracting
party.
ferc
and
we
agree
that
the
answer
is
no.
mobile-sierra's
presumption
of--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
i
represent
--
we
represent
--
i
represent
nrg,
which
entered
into
the
settlement
agreement
and
is
--
would
like
to
be
bound
by
the
results
of
the
auction
contract.
and
so
we
are
happy
with
the
agreements
we
enter
into,
and
a
concern
that
we
have
is
that
nonparties
can
come
in
and
challenge
the
contracts
under
a
lower
standard.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we
certainly
are
in
a
different
position,
but
they--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we
are
not
a
challenger.
we
are--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
nobody
is
arguing
that
a
noncontracting
party
is
bound
to
terms
that
it
didn't
agree
to
in
a
contract.
the
question
is
that,
when
a
noncontracting
party
comes
in
to
challenge
the
terms
that
two
consenting,
willing
buyer
and
a
seller
have
agreed
to,
what
is
the
standard
that
should
apply
for
that
outsider
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
rate
the
two
people
have
agreed
to?
and
mobile-sierra
and
morgan
stanley
all
provide
the
answer,
and
that
is
the
public
interest
standard.
the
standard
is
that,
under
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
must
presume
the
contract
rate
meets
the
just
and
reasonable
requirement
provided
by
law.
unless--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it
certainly
applies
to
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
and
it
would
be
a
rather
odd
rule
that
the
agency
which
is
charged
with
congress
with
administering
the
statute,
has
the
greatest
expertise,
is
bound
by
a
more
demanding
standard,
but
an
entity,
an
outsider
with
no
such
statutory
mandate
and
no
such
expertise
is
subject
to
a
lower
standard
when
it
comes
in
and
asks
for
a
contract
rate
to
be
overturned
or
abrogated.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
can't
be
reconciled
with
mobile-sierra's
foundation
and
the
need
for
contractual
certainty.
the
whole
point
is
to
provide
certainty
of
contract
so
that
companies
can
invest
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
infrastructure
projects
without
worrying
that
their
contracts
will
be
abrogated
lightly
after
the
fact.
but
few
could
risk
entering
into
such
contracts
and
make
those
investments
if
any
noncontracting
party
--
if
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine
applied
only
to
contracting
parties,
the
two
people
who
signed
the
contract.
but--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
the
nonparty
isn't
actually
paying
the
rate.
the
two
parties
are
paying
the
rate.
the
nonparty
is
saying:
i'm
adversely
affected
by
that
rate
indirectly.
and
we're
all
regularly
adversely
affected
by
contracts
we
didn't
enter
into.
the
example
we
give
in
our
brief
is
the
theatergoers
affected
by
the
amount
the
theater
pays
for
the
movies
and
the
popcorn
and
things
like
that.
but
the
question
is
what's
the
standard
for
that
outsider
to
abrogate
a
rate
the
two,
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller,
have
entered
into?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
it
certainly
applies
to
the
parties
most
directly
affected,
which
are
the
parties
that
actually
entered
into
the
contract
and
are
paying
the
rates.
so
it
applies
to
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
which
is
the
expert
regulator,
and
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
have
another
--
another
exemption
for
some
category
of
not
directly
bound
but
sufficiently
--
sufficiently
affected
parties.
it
would--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
the
answer
is
i
don't
know
if
there
is
other
areas
where
there's
a
possibility
of
a
memphis
clause,
if
that's
what
you're
referring
to,
where
the
parties
can
actually
--
when
they
enter
into
a
contract,
they
can
actually
lower
the
standard.
but
the
general
rule
is
that
when
a
party
comes
in
and
tries
to
abrogate
a
contract,
they
have
no
greater
rights
to
challenge
the
contract
than
the
parties
who
entered
it
themselves.
if
they
are
a
third-party
beneficiary,
it's
the
same
right.
and
if
they're
a
nonparty,
at
least
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
they
have
no
right
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
contract,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
contract
law.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
there
is
certainly
no
such
claim
before
this
court,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
one.
but
what
came
out
of
the
process
were
agreements
with
respect
to
rates,
and
the
settled
rule
is
that
such
agreements
cannot
be
abrogated
unless
the
public
interest
would
be
severely
harmed.
and--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--scores,
yes.
and--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--certainly
ferc
agrees
with
us
that
at
least
some
of
the
rates
before
this
court
are
contract
rates.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
the
lower
court
didn't
address
the
question.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
you
did
not,
and
this
court
regularly
declines
to
address
matters
that
were
merely
assumed
or
presumed
by
the
court
below
and
instead
answers
the
question
that
was
actually
answered
by
the
court
below,
which
in
this
case
is
an
important
and
recurring
question.
based
on
the
decision
below,
ferc
has
actually
gone
back
and
rewritten
more
than
50
contracts
to
create
an
exemption
for
noncontracting
parties,
including
contracts
that
are
clearly
bilateral
contracts,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
simply
to
say
that
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine
can't
apply
when
the
challenge
is
brought
by
a
noncontracting
party,
but
rather
what
ferc
wrote
into
the
contracts
effectively
was
the
highest
standard
permitted
by
law
will
be
applied
to
them.
and
nobody
sitting
at
these
tables
can
tell
this
court
what
that
standard
would
be,
which
is
precisely
why
this
is
an
important
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
we
don't,
which
is
precisely
one
of
the
--
we
don't
believe
that
the
court
had
authority
to
announce
that
rule.
we
actually
believe
the
court
erred
in
announcing
that
rule.
it--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
whether
or
not
these
are
contracted--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
the
lower
court
got
everything
wrong,
it
got
the
whole
thing
mixed
up;
send
it
back.
[laughter]
very
simple
and
very
straightforward.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
i--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--we
would
not
--
that,
justice
breyer,
in
fact
would
be
our
back-up
position.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
would
be
our
back-up
position.
our
position
is
once
you
have--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
we
would
agree
with
it,
that
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
law.
but
our
primary
position
and
the
primary
error
in
the
court
below
was
it
said
even
when
you
have
a
contract
rate,
nonparty
--
there
is
an
exemption
based
on
the
identity
of
the
challenging
party.
and
that
simply
cannot
be
reconciled
with--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
right.
it
merely
assumed
it.
and
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
the
answer
is
that
this
court
regularly,
regularly,
addresses
the
question
presented
and
the
issue
answered
below
without
delving
into
underlying
assumptions.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right,
and
one
example--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
precisely
right.
a
good
example
would
be
jama
v.
immigration
and
customs
enforcement,
where
the
question
was
whether
the
attorney
general
could
deport
an
alien
to
a
foreign
country
without
making
sure
the
country
would
accept
him.
and
the
court
said:
we're
not
going
to
address
whether
the
person
is
an
alien;
we
won't
address
whether
somalia
is
a
country;
we're
not
going
to
even
address
whether
this
person
is
removable
--
that's
all
for
the
court
on
remand;
we're
only
going
to
address
whether
or
not
there
has
to
be
a
prior
determination
that
the
country
will
accept
him.
the
same
rule
would
apply--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--are
you
asking
me
can
i
conceive
of
such
a
rate
that
would
fail
and
succeed
under
one?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
that
--
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
the
just
and
reasonable
standard,
the
ordinary
just
and
reasonable
standard,
is
you
can
actually
look
at
the
interests
of
the
contracting
parties
to
a
degree
that
you
cannot
under
the
public
interest
standard.
the
point
of
the
public
interest
standard
is
it
has
to
adversely
affect
the
interests
of
the
public.
the
whole
point--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
they
are
both
the
just
and
reasonable
standard.
and
the
one
could
violate
one
application--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
they
were
parties
to
the
settlement
process
simply
shows
that
they've
met
the
sort
of
broad
administrative
law
standing
requirements.
it
does
not
show
they
were
an
actual
purchaser
under
the
agreements
here.
and
i
think
that
is
actually
part
of
the
nub
of
what
was
bothering
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
d.c.
circuit
may
have
been
bothered
that
there
might
be
actual
purchasers
here,
people
who
directly
themselves
purchase
under
the
rate
who
haven't
agreed
to
it.
but
that
concern
is
wholly
subsumed
within
the
notion
of
whether
or
not
the
rate
that
entity
is
paying
is
a
contract
rate.
but
which
rates
here
are
contract
rates
or
not
contract
rates
is
an
issue
the
d.c.
circuit
didn't
actually
get
to.
it's
not
clear
it
was
properly
preserved
before
the
d.c.
circuit,
because
the
claim
that
some
of
the
rates
are
not
contract
rates
was
raised
only
by
intervenors.
so
while
we
adhere
to
our
view
that
these
are
contract
rates,
this
court
need
not
get
to
it.
it
need
only
address
the
issue
the
court
addressed
below,
which
is
whether
there
is
a
broad-based,
third-party
exception
to
mobile-sierra.
and
the
answer
is
no.
mobile-sierra
can't
be
energy
law's
equivalent
of
the
maginot
line,
that
it
protects
against
direct
assaults
from
the
contracting
parties
themselves
but
provides
no
protection,
not
whatsoever,
if
it's
flanked
by
noncontracting
parties
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
hope
you
use
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
