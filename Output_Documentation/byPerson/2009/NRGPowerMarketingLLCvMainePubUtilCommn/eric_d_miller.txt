mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
mobile-sierra
public
interest
standard
is
inapplicable
when
contract
rates
are
challenged
by
a
noncontracting
third
party.
that
error
provides
a
sufficient
basis
for
reversing
the
judgment
below,
and
although
there
are
other
issues
in
the
case,
those
issues
were
not
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
court
should
remand
and
allow
them
to
be
resolved
by
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
addressing
them
itself
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
this
court
in
morgan
stanley
described--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
the
--
the
court
in
morgan
stanley
held
that
mobile-sierra
rests
in
part
on
the
idea
that
when
wholesale
businesses
negotiate
a
contract
for
the
sale
of
power,
that
that
can
be
presumed
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no.
we
quarrel--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
the
way
that
this
court
has
described
the
standard.
now,
of
course,
in
this
case
the
commission
looked
at
the
mechanism
created,
the
forward
capacity
auction,
and
it
looked
at
the
transition
rates,
and
it
didn't
simply
presume
them
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
it
--
based
on
its
examination
of
them
--
determined
that
the
rates
set
out
in
the
settlement
and
the
rates
that
would
be
established
under
the
mechanism
created
by
the
settlement
would
be
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
the
settlement
--
no
one
is
suggesting
that
the
settlement
agreement
itself
is
a
mobile-sierra
contract.
the
settlement
was
a
resolution
of
a
disputed
proceeding
before
the
commission.
it's
sort
of
analogous
to
a
consent
decree.
the
commission
had
to
approve
that
before
it
became
effective.
by
its
own
terms,
the
settlement
agreement
wouldn't
become
effective
as
binding
between
the
parties
unless
the
commission
approved
it.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
we
--
we
do
think
that
you
should
reverse
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
to
the
extent
that
you
think
that
there
are
other
issues
that
are
presented
other
than
the
question
presented
as
stated
by
the
petition.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
should
have
been
granted.
right.
yes.
that's
right.
it
--
i
mean,
our
view
is
that
the
appropriate
disposition
is
a
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
allow
it
to
decide
whether
these
other
issues
are
properly
before
it,
and
the
answer
to
that
may
be
--
be
no,
but
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
that
in
the
first
instance.
the
reason
that,
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
holding
that
there's
a
third-party
exception
to
mobile-sierra
is
that,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
court
in
morgan
stanley
recognized
that
mobile-sierra
rests
on
a
presumption
that
the
rate
negotiated
between
sophisticated
wholesale
businesses
it
can
be
presumed
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
that's
a
feature
of
the
rate.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
same
rate
for
the
same
power
could
be
just
and
reasonable
when
it's
challenged
by
one
person,
but
not
when
it's
challenged
by
somebody
else.
second,
the
purpose
of
the
public
interest
test
under
mobile-sierra
is
to
allow
contract
modification
only
when
it's
necessary
to
protect
third
parties;
that
is,
members
of
the
public.
so
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say
that
that
test
is
inapplicable
whenever
you
have
a
challenge
that's
presented
by
one
of
those
third
parties
or
a
member
of
the
public.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
in
the
contract
setting?
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes,
third
parties
could
come
in,
and
if
they
--
they
would
have
to
satisfy
the
public
interest
test.
they
would
have
to
show
that
there
are
--
the
court
has
described
it
variously
as
extraordinary
circumstances,
severe
impact
on
the
public
interest.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
that
sort
of
argument
would
be
foreclosed
by
sierra.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
you
have--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--what
--
what
the
court
said
in
sierra
is
that
mere
unfairness,
one
of
the
--
the
fact
that
one
of
the
contracting
parties
got
a
bad
bargain
is
not
a
reason
to
set
aside
the
contract,
except
for
the
court
did
reserve
the
extraordinary
circumstance
where
it's
going
to
put
the
supplier
out
of
business,
which
would
adversely
affect
the
public
interest
if
they
can
no
longer
deliver
power
at
that
rate.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
draws
no
distinction
between
those
two--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--okay.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes.
and
i
think
certainly
the
commission
appreciates
the
idea
that
there's
something
wrong
about
--
or
there's
something
unfair
about
a
and
b
getting
together
and
deciding
on
the
rate
that
c
is
going
to
pay.
and
to
the
extent
that
you're
concerned
about
that
situation,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
when
a
and
b
set
the
rate
that
c
has
to
pay,
c
is
not
paying
a
contract
rate
in
the
mobile-sierra
sense,
because
c
is
not
--
c
is
paying
a
rate
it
has
not
agreed
to.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
court
did
not
use
that
mode
of
analysis.
the
court
below
said
that
we
were
talking
about
contract
rates
and
their
being
challenged
by
nonparties
to
the
contract,
and
the
court
thought
that
in
that
context
the
mobile-sierra
public
interest
standard
doesn't
apply,
and
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right,
because
c's
rate
in
that
scenario
is
not
a
rate
that
it
has
agreed
to.
it's
being
set
unilaterally
by
people
other
than
it,
and
so
it's
in
our
view
more
appropriately
characterized
as
a
tariff
rate
that
is
not
subject
to
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
that
is--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right.
and
the
d.c.
circuit
made
that
quite
clear,
particularly
on
page
20a
of
the
petition
appendix
in
its
opinion,
where
it
described
the
question
before
it,
yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
--
that
is
our
view,
that
that's
--
it's
not
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
--
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
the
court
didn't
reach--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
we
think
the
court
should
answer
only
the
question
that
was
ruled
upon
below
and
leave
those
other
issues
to
the
extent
that
they
have
been
properly--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
think
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
it
is
quite
common
for
this
court
to
decide
a
case,
taking
the
case
on
the
same
assumption
that
the
court
of
appeals
did,
and
answer
the
questions
that
are
raised--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i'm
not--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--right.
right.
[laughter]
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no,
your
honor,
because
we
do
agree
that
at
least
some
of
the
rates
that
are
covered
by
the
public
interest
review
clause
in
the
settlement--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
transition
rates
as
between
the
settling
parties.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
their
validity
doesn't
--
their
validity
depends
upon
the
mechanism
that's
created
by
the
settlement,
which
the
commission
reviewed
under
the
ordinary
just
and
reasonable
standard.
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
clearing
prices
of
the
auctions,
which
are
the
--
i
mean,
what
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--what
--
what
the
commission
thought
is
that
the
--
the
commission
looked
at
the
auction
mechanism
and
determined
that
it
was
likely
to
produce
just
and
reasonable
results.
and
the
commission
emphasized
that
at
any
point
anybody
can
come
in
and
challenge
the
auction
rules
and
say
that
they're
not
just
and
reasonable,
and
the
commission
will
review
that
entirely
unencumbered
by
this
provision
of
the
settlement.
and,
in
addition,
within
45
days
after
each
auction,
anybody
can
come
in
and
challenge
those
results.
and
only
after
that
45-day
period
does
the
public
interest
review
clause
become
effective.
the
--
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
about
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
is
that
this
court
made
clear
in
morgan
stanley
that
mobile-sierra
applies
to
the
commission
when
it
is
acting
sua
sponte,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
ferc's
power
should
depend
on
whether
somebody
has
filed
a
complaint.
if
ferc
is
bound,
public
interest
standard,
under
mobile-sierra
when
there
is
a
mobile-sierra
contract,
it
makes
very
little
sense
to
say
that
it
ceases
to
be
bound
by
that
as
long
as
anybody
in
the
world
other
than
the
contracting
party
comes
in
and
files
the
complaint
to
initiate
the
ferc
investigation.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
had
not
understood
that
to
be
their
position,
but
i
think
it
would
be
very
strange--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--if
the
commission
had
one
standard,
and
on
review
of
the
commission
order,
the
court
were
to
apply
a
standard
different
from
what--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
i
think
we
would
agree
that
they're
both
quite
strange.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--thank
you.
