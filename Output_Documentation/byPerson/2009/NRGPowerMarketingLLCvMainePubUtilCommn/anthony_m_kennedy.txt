justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am
i
correct
--
and
maybe
this
is
more
proper
for
the
government
than
for
you,
or
for
all
the
parties.
i
take
it
no
one
questions
the
propriety,
the
lawfulness,
of
the
ferc
determination
to
convene
the
settlement
process?
there's
no
argument
that
this
was
an
improper,
an
unlawful
process?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
the
--
are
the
respondents
correct
and
was
the
court
of
appeals
correct
in
calling
this
a
presumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
calling
the
rate
that
was
agreed
upon
a
presumption
of
a
reasonable
rate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
don't
quarrel
with
that
word--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
would
you
quarrel
with
that
characterization?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
rationale
is
the
commonsense
notion
that
it's
a
presumptively
reasonable
rate,
and
if
that's
true,
how
is
that
altered
by
the
identity
of
the
party
that
attacks
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
is
--
why
is
it
not
presumptively
a
commonsense
notion
when
some
different
party
attacks
it?
it
--
it's
still
a
determination
that
this
rate,
as
a
commonsense
matter,
is
presumptively
reasonable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
that's
different
than
mobile-sierra,
although
mobile-sierra
did
invoke
market
forces
of
another
kind
--
of
another
kind.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
anything
in
your
argument
turn
on
the
fact
that
the
respondents
were
parties
to
the
settlement
process?
