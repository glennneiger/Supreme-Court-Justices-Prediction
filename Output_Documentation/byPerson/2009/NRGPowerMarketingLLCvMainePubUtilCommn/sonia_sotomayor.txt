justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
it
matter
who
is
the
challenger?
are
you
in
a
different
position
than
the
other
parties
to
this
action?
you're
a
third
party
who
is
being
bound
to
a
particular
rate.
the
others
do
have
a
different
interest,
or
they're
in
a
different
position
with
respect
to
their
challenges,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
aren't
you
in
a
different
position
than
those
other
challengers?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
doesn't
that
difference
do
what
the
d.c.
circuit
said?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
i
do
understand
that,
but
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
the
d.c.
circuit
court's
reasoning
was
very
simple:
you're
a
contracting
party;
you're
bound
to
it.
why
should
the
others
who
didn't
agree
to
this
term
be
bound
by
mobile-sierra?
that's
the
essence
of
their
holding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
then
does
that
bind
all
types
of
third
parties?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
just
said
to
justice
scalia
that
the
court
below
didn't
find
that
this
was
a
contract
rate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
assumed
it,
so
you're
asking
us
to
assume
the
same
thing
and
announce--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--an
advisory
opinion
that
if
these
are
contract
rates,
they're
bound
by
mobile-sierra;
and
if
they're
not,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
--
what
would
happen
in
a
situation
in
which
there's
a
tariff
price
instead
of
a
contract
price?
in
those
situations,
the
buyer
could
come
in,
presumably,
and
say:
it's
not
a
fair
and
just
price
vis-Ã -vis
me;
i
didn't
agree
to
it;
it's
not.
in
a
normal
situation
with
a
contract
price,
third
parties,
many
not
--
not
the
main
--
main
parties,
like
the
maine
public
utilities
commission,
could
come
in
and
say
what?
it's
not
fair
to
the
public
in
general?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
they
come
in
and
show
that
between
the
contracting
parties
the
price
is
unfair?
is
that
what
this
is
about,
that
they
would
try
to
come
in
and
somehow
define
the
public
interest
as
being
informed
by
the
unfairness
to
the
individual
parties?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
that's
the
question
before
us.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
d.c.
circuit
said
they
shouldn't
be
bound
by
that
determination,
and
you're
arguing
that
they
should
be
because--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
it
goes
back
to
my
original
question
with
your
adversary,
which
is:
is
there
a
difference
among
the
objectors
here,
between
those
who
are
objecting
to
the
terms
between
the
two
contracting
parties
as
outsiders,
as
members
of
the
public,
and
those
who
are
objecting
because
this
settlement
agreement
does
something
different?
it
binds
them
personally
to
a
buying
price,
and
so
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
different
approach
to
those
individuals?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
agree.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
the
question
is:
should
there
be
a
distinction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that's
what
the
third
circuit
--
i'm
sorry,
that's
what
the
court
below
didn't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
they
can
self-supply,
can't
they?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
--
can
i
go
--
stop
you
there,
just
so
that
we're
all
on
the
same
page?
if
this
were,
hypothetically,
a
contract
rate
--
some
of
the
transition
fees
appear
to
be.
the
parties
to
that
agreement
are
saying,
we're
going
to
pay,
in
transition
fees,
x
amount.
assuming,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
transition
fees
are
contract
rates,
are
you
disputing
the
circuit
court's
analysis
that
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine
applies
to
those
contract
rates
and
binds
third
parties
who
are
challenging
that
particular
rate
between
those
two
parties?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
--
you
can't
because
that's
the
doctrine.
okay.
under
what
circumstances
could
a
third
party
challenge
that
rate
as
not
fair
and
reasonable,
as
opposed
to
being
contrary
to
the
public
interest?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
under
what
circumstances
--
i've
given
you
the
absolute
minimum
example.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there's
a
rate
set
between
two
parties,
what
third
parties
--
under
what
circumstances
could
a
third
party
come
in
and
say
--
on
some
standard
different
than
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
how
could
they
prove
other
that
that
rate's
not
fair
and
reasonable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
does
the
word
"directly
affected"
mean
to
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
now,
you're
trying
to
confuse
the
issue.
yes,
that's
the
auction
question
and
whether
that
auction
is
a
contract
price
subject
to
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine
at
all.
that's
a
different
issue.
i've
given
you
the
simple
hypothetical.
could
all
of
those
other
respondents
--
except
nstar
--
come
in
and
say
that
it's
not
fair
and
reasonable
to
me
because,
at
the
end,
i'm
going
to
pay
more;
i'm
going
to
do
something
--
it's
going
to
affect
me
in
some
indirect
way.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
there's
something
else
that
ferc
must
do
when
those
third
parties
come
into
--
into
that
simple
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
want
to
keep
going
back
to
the
facts,
and
i'm
dealing
with
a
hypothetical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
taking
the
extreme
--
you
are
accepting
that
--
what
the
lower
court
said?
under
every
circumstance,
if
it
involves
a
contract
price,
fair
and
reasonable
being
something
other
than
contrary
to
the
public
interest?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
adversary's
arguments
that
what
you're
really
saying
is
you
can
never
have
finality
to
a
contract
agreement
between
parties
because
any
third
party
can
come
in
and
raise--
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
contracting
parties
and
argue
the
rate's
not
fair
and
reasonable?
