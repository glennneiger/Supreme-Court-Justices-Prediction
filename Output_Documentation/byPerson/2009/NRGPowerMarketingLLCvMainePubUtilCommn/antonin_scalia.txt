justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
lower
court
reach
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
we
grant
cert
on
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
took
the
words
right
out
of
your
mouth.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
call
them
all
advisory
opinions
if
you
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
whenever
there
is
another
issue
in
the
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
which
we
remand,
you
could
say,
oh,
we're
just
giving
an
advisory
opinion
on
the
issue
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
and
reasonable,
or
would
comply
with
the
public
interest
standard?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what's
the
use
of
having
mobile-sierra
if
--
if
they're
going
to
reexamine
the
thing
under
the
usual
standard
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
mobile-sierra
does
not
apply
to
an
agreement
between
a
and
b
that
not
only
sets
the
rate
between
the
two,
but
also
fixes
the
rate
that
one
of
them
will
charge
to
c?
the
last
feature
is
not
a
mobile-sierra
--
is
not
eligible
for
mobile-sierra
treatment.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
that's
--
but
that's
not
what
the
d.c.
circuit
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
d.c.
circuit
said
that
the
entire
--
there
is
no
application
of
mobile-sierra
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
--
we
don't
know
that
that's
the
other
side's
position.
i
was
going
to
ask
him
that.
their
position
is
that
the
third
party
can
--
can
attack
the
--
the
agreement
without
being
encumbered
by
mobile-sierra,
but
i
don't
know
that
they've
said
that
once
a
third
party
does
mount
such
an
attack
the
commission
is
suddenly
also
unencumbered
by
mobile-sierra.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
assumed
that
their
position
is
the
commission
remains
bound
by
mobile-sierra,
but
these
third
parties
can
--
can
demand
a
court
--
that
a
court
apply
a
different
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
that's
any
stranger
than
saying
the
commission
has
one
standard
until
somebody
else
challenges
it,
whereupon
the
commission
has
a
different
standard.
you
don't
think
that's
strange?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
bound
to
it.
they
--
they
are
saying
that
--
claiming
--
that
their
rates
are
too
high
because
the
contract
was
too
high,
so
--
and
therefore,
their
rates
are
unreasonable.
and
what
mobile-sierra
says
--
it
certainly
says
it
as
between
the
two
contracting
parties
--
that
if
it's
at
arm-length
between
sophisticated
seller
and
buyer
of
--
of
the
power,
they
are
bound
by
it,
and
the
--
and
the
issue
is
here
is
whether
somebody
downstream
who
says
that
since
this
contract
is
so
exorbitant,
the
rates
are
too
high,
whether
that
person
is
likewise
bound
by
mobile-sierra.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
--
that's
because
of
section
4.c,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
which
--
which
gives
the
commission
a
good
deal
of
flexibility,
which
you
say
you
--
your
clients
don't
have
or
your
state
doesn't
have.
but
that
isn't
the
basis
on
which
this
case
was
decided
below.
it
was
decided
on
the
very
simple
basis
that
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine
simply
does
not
apply
to
challenges
by
third
parties.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
details
of
4.c
and
the
--
the
excessive
discretion
given
--
given
to
the
commission
but
not
to
you.
it
was
a
very
simple
proposition
on
which
we
granted
cert,
whether
mobile-sierra's
public
interest
standard
applies
when
a
contract
rate
is
challenged
by
an
entity
that
was
not
a
party
to
the
contract.
that's
the
question.
and
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
support
the
opinion
of
the
--
of
the
court
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
about
contracts.
it's
about
reasonable
rates.
i
thought
what
it
was,
was
a
determination
by
the
commission,
approved
by
--
by
this
court,
that
when
two
giants
of
the
industry,
very
knowledgeable,
deal
at
arm's-length
and
come
up
with
--
with
a
contract,
that
is
presumptively
reasonable,
and
unless
it
contravenes
the
public
interest,
that
rate
will
--
will
be
upheld.
now,
you
say
it
should
be
upheld
only
between
the
two
contracting
parties.
what
good
does
that
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
we
don't
like
to
decide
these
questions,
you
know,
initially.
we
--
we
like
to
have
some
lower
court
do
the
dirty
work,
and
we
can
correct
them.
[laughter]
it's
--
it's
a
lot
easier
that
way,
and
we're
more
likely
to
reach
a
correct
result,
rather
than
--
than
wading
in
with,
you
know,
--
from
scratch.
that's
our
usual
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
anybody
before--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
suggested
that
mobile-sierra
is
a
"sometimes"
thing?
do
--
did
any
of
our
opinions
say
that
it's
a
"sometimes"
thing,
except
in
one
respect,
and
that
is
the
doctrine
does
not
apply
when
--
when,
downstream,
the
rates
--
or
even
between
the
parties,
the
rates
would
violate
the
public
interest?
that's
a
"sometimes".
it
won't
apply
then,
but
have
we
ever
suggested
that,
you
know,
today
it
may;
tomorrow
it
--
it
won't?
or
have
we
ever
suggested
what
standards
might
determine
the
"sometimes"
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
suggested
how
you
can
--
you
can
have
a
"sometimes"
doctrine
which
will
produce
the
stability
in
the
industry
that
mobile-sierra
was
intended
to
produce?
i
mean,
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
mobile-sierra.
people
had
to
be
able
to
predict
whether
they
can
take
natural
gas
out
of
the
ground,
how
much
they
can
make
on
it,
and
once
they
enter
into
an
arm's-length
contract,
they
should
be
able
to
rely
on
it.
that
was
the
whole
purpose.
and,
now,
you
want
to
us
say,
well,
sometimes
it
will
work,
and
sometimes
it
won't.
and
we're
not
going
to
say
when;
we're
going
to
leave
it
to
the
d.c.
circuit
to
invent
some
"sometimes".
that
doesn't
make
any
sense,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
ferc
can't
--
can
ferc
--
can
ferc
challenge,
too?
because
ferc's
a
--
sort
of
a
third
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
--
so
mobile-sierra
doesn't
apply
to
ferc,
even?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
does
it
apply
to?
i
mean,
it's
just
--
just
the
two
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
a
noncontracting
party
go
to
ferc
and
challenge
it
before
ferc,
whereupon
ferc
is
no
longer
bound
by
mobile-sierra?
or
is
ferc
suddenly
unchained
when
a
third
party
brings
a
proceeding
before
ferc?
it's
a
strange
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
the
public
interest
standard
is
a
just
and
reasonable
standard.
what
--
what
it
amounts
to
is
saying,
when
--
when
you
have
a
contract
rate
that's
been
negotiated
between
sophisticated
parties,
that
rate
is
presumptively
just
and
reasonable,
and
the
only
way
you
can
show
that
it
is
not
just
and
reasonable
is
to
show
that
the
public
interest
is
harmed.
it's
--
it's
not
something
different
from
the
just
and
reasonable
standard,
or
it
would
be
contrary
to
--
to
the
statute
because
the
statute
requires
that
the
rates
be
just
and
reasonable,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
that.
that's
very
imaginative.
[laughter]
