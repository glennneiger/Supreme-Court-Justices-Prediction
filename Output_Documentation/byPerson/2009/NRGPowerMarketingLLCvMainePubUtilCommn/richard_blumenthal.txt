mr.
richard
blumenthal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
one
central
truth
here
on
which
we
and
the
government
agree.
these
are
not
contract
rates
at
issue
here.
they
are
tariff
rates.
that
is
a
central
truth
that
unites
the
government
and
the
respondents,
because
these
rates
out
of
the
auction
process
will
be
rates
of
general
applicability,
applying
not
only
to
those
contractors,
the
parties
who
agreed
to
the
contract,
but
they
will
be
binding
on
nstar,
which
sells
25
percent
of
the
power
in
the
new
england
market;
they
will
be
binding
on
the
other
five
respondents,
including
maine
and
massachusetts
as
well
as
connecticut.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
even
if
they
had
that
option,
justice
sotomayor,
it
would
not
change
a
tariff
into
a
contract.
just
because
there
is
the
option
of
self-supply
doesn't
mean
that
parties
who
are
disputing
the
contract,
disagreeing
with
it,
not
to
mention
not
contracting,
should
be
bound
to
it
as
though
it
were
a
contract.
the
option
of--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--justice
scalia,
with
all
due
respect,
that
situation
is
not
here.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
absolutely
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
d.c.
circuit's
reasoning
here
was
based
on
facts
that
were,
in
fact,
not
present
here.
we
agreed
then,
we
argued
to
the
ferc,
we
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
argued
in
opposition
to
certiorari,
that
what's
involved
here
are
tariff
rates.
and
the
d.c.
circuit's
ruling
in
our
view
was
correct,
and
its
reasoning
was
correct
insofar
as
mobile-sierra
binds
contracting
parties,
as
justice
scalia
has
just
articulated
and
morgan
stanley
reiterated.
it
involves
parties
trying
to
escape
an
improvident
bargain.
what
we
have
here
is
an
auction
system
that
sets
rules
of
general
applicability.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
section
4.c
of
the
settlement
agreement
that
ferc
approved
under
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
says
to
the
world:
we
can
make
an
exception
for
ourselves
under
the
just
and
reasonable
--
under
the
memphis
rule.
we
can
make
an
exception
to
the
public
interest
standard.
the
government
says
it
can
make
an
exception
for
itself.
the
only
ones
powerless
to
invoke--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--there
is.
there
is
in
section
4.c
in
effect
a
modified
memphis
clause
which
says
that
the
parties
can
come
together
and
agree
to
a
different
standard,
justice
ginsburg.
so,
in
a
sense,
the
irony
here,
if
the
court
were
to
reverse
and
apply
morgan
stanley
--
i'm
sorry,
mobile-sierra
and
morgan
stanley
--
would
be
that
the
only
ones
powerless
to
invoke
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
to
review
the
auction
rates
would
be
the
respondents--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--who
never
agreed
to
this
supposed
contract.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
justice
breyer,
there
is
an
immense
difference,
as
you
and
the
court
is
well
aware
because
it
has
been
articulated
in
opinions,
between
the
public
interest
standard
and
the
ordinary
just
and
reasonable
standard,
and
the
government
would
like
that
discretion
to
say
in
effect--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--we're
not
here
by
choice,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
blumenthal
if
you
tell
me
at
this
point
to
go
home,
i'm
happy
to
do
it.
[laughter]
we're
here
because
we
believe
that
the
section
4.c
establishes
a
standard
that
is
contrary
to
the
statute,
the
just
and
reasonable
standard.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
but
the
--
the
commission
should
not
be
accorded
discretion
to
adopt
a
standard
that
contravenes
the
statute.
we're
dealing
here--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
whether
the
government
and
the
commission
should
have
virtually
unbridled
discretion
to
adopt
a
standard
that
has
been
called
"practically
insurmountable",
as
recently
as
morgan
stanley.
it
was--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--section
4.c
of
the
agreement--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--our
answer
is--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--we
do
support
it,
justice
scalia,
and
the
reason
we
do
is
that
mobile-sierra
is
about
contracts.
and--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--it
--
it
can
be
held
--
upheld
only
between
the
two
contracting
parties
if
they're
the
ones
who
have
agreed
to
it.
under
mobile-sierra,
there
is
a
presumption
of
free
negotiation
and
consent.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
because,
your
honor,
the
question
also
is
what
the
standard
should
be
if
it's
presumptively
reasonable;
and
it
is
taken
as
such,
because
it
is
freely
negotiated,
because
there
is
consent
to
it.
because
one
of
them
is
seeking
to
escape
it,
and
use
the
commission
to
escape
it,
then
mobile-sierra
says
it
should
be
presumed
just
and
reasonable,
and
only
when
the
public
interest
is
seriously
harmed--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--as
to
this
case,
again,
there
are
no
rates
yet.
we're
talking
about
an
auction
mechanism
that
will
not
even
involve
a
contract,
and
the
government
says
so
as
well,
that
--
we
and
the
government
agree
that
it
will
not
involve
a
contract.
so
how
can--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--well,
you
know,
i
feel,
with
all
due
respect,
that
we
are
talking
in
alternate
universes
here,
the
government
and
the
petitioners
and
we;
and
the
reason
is,
as
the
court
has
quite
aptly
identified,
the
court
of
appeals
used
a
rationale
that
simply
is
not
wholly
fitting
to
the
facts
here.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
well--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--because
addressing
that
question,
justice
ginsburg,
as
justice
breyer
said,
is
not
the
question
that
the
commission
addressed.
it
isn't
the
question
in
terms
of
the
factual
situation
here
that
is
really
at
issue.
we're
dealing
here
with
tariff
rates
that
are
set
through
the
auction
mechanism.
if
the
court--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--and
the
government's
position
on
certiorari
was
that
there
should
be
a
remand
without
reversal
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
morgan
stanley.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
i
recognize
that
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
court
is
presented
with
a
dilemma
here
because
it's
dealing
with
tariff
rates
when
the
question
presented
talks
about
contract
rates.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and,
justice
breyer,
the
"sometimes"
is
absolutely
right
from
our
standpoint.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
there
may
be--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--no.
in
our
view,
mr.
chief
justice,
noncontracting
parties
under
mobile-sierra
cannot
be
bound--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--by
tariff
rates.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
the
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
"sometimes"
would
include
contract
rates.
in
other
words,
where
there
are
strictly
contract
rates
--
whereas,
here,
we
have
tariff
rates
--
ferc
would
not
have
that
discretion.
it
cannot
have
discretion
to
apply
the
public
interest
standard
to
tariff
rates
any
more
than
it
could
apply
the
ordinary
just
and
reasonable
standard
to
contract
rates
which--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--mobile-sierra
fits.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
mobile--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--again,
i
may
have
been
unclear,
and
i
apologize
if
i
was,
in
response
to
justice
breyer
and
the
chief
justice's
question,
but
the
point
is
that
the
"sometimes"
would
not
apply
to
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
where
there
are
rates
of
general
applicability
and
tariffs.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
justice
sotomayor,
we
are
not
challenging
that
a
contract
should
bind
those
two
parties
or
those
hundred-plus
parties
that
agree
to
the
contract.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
well,
the
public
interest
standard,
as
articulated
in
morgan
stanley,
would
require
showing
an
extraordinarily
high
burden
of
proof.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
if--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--if
that
party
were
directly
affected--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--it
would
mean
having
to
pay
rates
that
flow
inevitably--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--our
position,
justice
sotomayor
--
and
it's
a
hypothetical
here
because,
again
--
and
i
apologize
for
belaboring
the
point,
but
what
we
have
here
are
rates
of
general
applicability.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
the
hypothetical,
i
would
say,
is
answerable
that
the
just
and
reasonable
standard,
as
it
was
applied
in
bridgeport
energy
and
milford
power
and
tens
of
other
cases--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--fair
and
reasonable
is
a
standard
different
from
the
public
interest
standard.
that's
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
well,
ferc
is
--
is
bound
by
the
same
law
that
applies
to
third
parties,
which
is--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--mobile-sierra
applies--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--mobile-sierra
effectively
says
those
two
parties
are
bound
by
the
contract,
and
ferc
is
bound
by
it
--
that's
morgan
stanley
--
no
matter
when
the
issue
is
raised.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
a
noncontracting
party,
if
it
is
a
rate
that
applies
generally,
can
challenge
it.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
ferc
is
bound
by
the
just
and
reasonable
standard.
that's
what
the
law
says.
this
law
is
a
public
--
is
a
consumer
protection
statute
that
says,
upon
complaint
or
upon
ferc's
own
motion,
it
may
apply
that
just
and
reasonable
standard.
now,
the
public
interest
standard
looks
for
serious
harm
to
the
public.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
it
--
it
is
part
--
they
are
one
standard,
as
morgan
stanley
very
clearly
says,
and
the
question
of
what
noncontracting
parties
can
challenge
a
statute
depends
on
who
the
noncontracting
party
is,
the
nature
of
the
contract,
what
interest
is
affected,
and
i
would
presume
some
of
those
factors
might
affect
ferc's
judgment.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
where
we
are
is,
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
court
were
to
modify
or
clarify
the
public
interest
standard
to
make
it
more
accommodating
to
the
kinds
of
challenges
we've
been
discussing,
that
could
be
one
outcome
here.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
well,
simply
to
clarify
that
it
involves
not
necessarily
an
insurmountable
barrier.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
it
is
again
a
question
not
presented,
and
none
of
us
so
far
on
this
side
of
the
table
has
mentioned
the
chenery
doctrine,
but
perhaps
that
also
should
be
considered,
that
the
agency
made
a
decision
on
a
different
basis
than
it
is
now
advocating
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
--
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
we're
defending
the
d.c.
circuit's
ruling
and
decision.
the
question
presented,
in
a
sense,
takes
a
different
view
of
the
factual
situation
that
the
government
and
we
agree
prevails
here,
and
we
are
suggesting
that
perhaps
for
the
d.c.
circuit
to
have
said
in
its
opinion
mobile-sierra
does
not
apply
to
noncontracting
parties
when
there
are
contracts
that
produce
tariff
rates.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and
one
modifier
would
have
spared
this
court
and
ourselves
the
difficulties
that
we
now
have,
but
it
is
that
modifier
that
would,
in
effect,
surmount
the
very
difficult
and
thorny
issues
that
the
court
has
well
identified
here.
thank
you.
