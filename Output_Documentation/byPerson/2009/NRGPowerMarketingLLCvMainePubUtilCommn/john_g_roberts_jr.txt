chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
08-674,
nrg
power
marketing
v.
maine
public
utilities
commission.
mr.
lamken.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
bit
much
to
say
that
the
importance
is
to
preserve
the
stability
of
two
parties'
contract,
and,
therefore,
a
third
party
who
didn't
sign
the
contract
is
bound
to
the
two
parties'
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
why
don't
you
--
why
isn't
it
restricted
to
some
type
of
direct,
parties
directly
affected,
as
well
as
--
i
mean,
you
complain
about
the
hordes
of
people
who
will
be
able
to
challenge
these.
well,
it
assumes
that
anybody
can
challenge
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
what
do
you
mean,
an
exemption
for
noncontracting
parties?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
agree
that
ferc
has
the
authority
to
exempt
noncontracting
parties
from
the
binding
effect
of
the
contract
rates,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
opening
statement
about
what
this
court
should
do
is
a
change
from
your
statement
of
what
we
should
do
in
your
briefs.
in
your
--
you
just
said
the
court
should
remand
for
further
considerations
other
issues.
in
your
brief,
you
say
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
insofar
as
it
granted
the
petitions
for
review.
you've
changed
your
position
on
what
we
should
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
change.
before
you
didn't
think
there
were
other
issues
that
affected
the
determination
or
might.
you
said
we
should
grant
--
reverse
the
determination
insofar
as
it
granted
the
petitions
for
review.
if
we
say
that
the
petitions
for
review
should
have
been
denied,
then
we
don't
send
it
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
just
to
follow
up,
you
think
we
should
not
address
either
of
those--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--whether
it's
a
contract
or
whether
you
have
authority
to
make
an
exception
to
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
get
to
reserve
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
blumenthal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
in
a
very
tough
position
because
of
the
way
this
has
progressed.
i
think
you
can
make
a
strong
argument
that
you
shouldn't
be
bound
by
these
contract
rates
if
ferc
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
discretion
to
let
you
go.
if
ferc
has
a
lot
of
discretion
to
let
you
go,
your
argument
that
you
shouldn't
be
bound
is
a
lot
weaker.
and
the
way
the
case
has
been
presented,
we're
pushing
on
only
one
--
one
side
of
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
we
ruled
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
we
decided
it
on
that
basis,
we
would
be
giving
ferc
a
victory
on
the
question
of
its
authority
to
depart
from
mobile-sierra,
even
though
that
wasn't
presented
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
know--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
justice
breyer
was
hypothesizing
that
sometimes
they
can
be,
and
sometimes
they
can't
be.
and
you
accepted
his
proposition.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that's
a
very
significant
question.
ferc
wants
to
argue
it
here,
but
it's
not
before
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
also
a
third
question
that's
not
presented,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lamken,
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
08-674
nrg
power
marketing
versus
main
public
utilities
commission,
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
