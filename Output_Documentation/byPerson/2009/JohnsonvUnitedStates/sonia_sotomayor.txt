can
i
ask
you
something?
in
your
definition,
you
appear
to
hinge
it
on
the
fact
that
the
force
used
has
to
cause
injury
of
some
type,
that.
that
appears
to
be
the
only
definition
you
can
give.
but
the
use
of
physical
force
means
just
the
use
of
force,
strong
force,
violent
force,
aggressive
force,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
necessarily
has
to
cause
injury.
would
my
rearing
back
and
slapping
you?
in
those
instances
slapping
doesn't
cause
physical
injury
as
that
term
is
defined
in
the
common
law,
which
is
an
injury
of
lasting
effect.
you
may
have
some
redness
for
a
second,
but
that's
all.
would
that
qualify
as
a
crime
of
violence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
violence
has
a
broader
meaning.
it
generally
means
a
strong
force
or
a
strong
--
physical
force
generally
has
some
relative
degree
of
--
of
impact.
i
agree
with
you,
the
common
definition
talks
that
way.
why
should
we
read
something
more
into
it,
like
physical
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
many
will,
but
don't
--
serious
use
of
force
doesn't
necessarily
always.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel
--
i'm
sorry.
please
finish
and
then
i
will--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
you
see
that
you
don't
have
the
inquiry.
the
issue
is
not
whether
it
causes
serious
injury
or
not,
the
issue
is
whether
the
nature
of
the
force
used
is
physical
force.
and,
so,
if
you
look
at
the
common
definition
of
"physical
force"
in
the
dictionary,
which
your
adversaries
did
very
well
in
their
brief,
physical
force
has
in
its
ordinary
meaning
the
use
of
some
strength,
of
some
power,
and
generally
kissing
doesn't
require
that
strength
or
power,
touching
someone
on
the
shoulder,
doesn't.
all
of
these
activities
are
prohibited
by
this
statute
if
they
are
unwanted.
so
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
they
present
the
risk
of
physical
injury,
the
issue
is
whether
in
all
applications
or
in
a
substantial
number
they
don't
require
the
use
of
strength
to
--
in
its
application.
that's
a
different
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mainly
because
--
now
we
are
getting
to
judge
easterbrook's
argument
about
the
dime
--
you
know
if
i
touch
myself,
i
have
now
used
force.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
--
i'm
sorry.
before
you
go
on,
your
adversary
claims
you
waived
by
not
raising
this
as
an
--
as
an
alternative
in
the
cert
stage.
could
you
fold
that
into
your
continuation
of
this
answer?
