ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
primary
definition
of
violent
felony
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
as,
justice
alito,
you
have
noted
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
you
have
noted,
almost
precisely
tracks
the
general
definition
of
the
crime
of
battery;
that
is,
the
unlawful
application
of
physical
force
to
the
person
of
another.
petitioner's
primary
submission--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
it's
certainly
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
congress
could
have
defined
the
category
of
predicates
for
the
acca
in
that
way
by
listing
certain
offenses,
which
would
then
require
the
courts
to
determine
what
the
generic
elements
of
those
offenses
were,
as
this
court
did
with
respect
to
burglary
in
taylor.
but
congress
instead
decided
to
list
in
its
primary
definition
of
violent
felony
the
common
element
that
it
thought
as
a
categorical
matter
indicated
a
sufficient
potential
for
harm
that
the
crime
ought
to
be
singled
out
as
a
predicate
for
acca
enhancement.
and
that
single
element
was
the
use
of
physical
force
against
the
person
of
another.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
creates
a
mandatory
minimum
of
15
years.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
there
are
a
few
responses
to
that
question.
the
first
is
that
a
threatened
use
of
force
is
normally
considered
and
normally
punished
under
the
criminal
law
as
a
crime
of
assault.
and
for
the
reasons
that
justice
breyer
has
noted
already
in
the
arguments,
it
seems
awfully
unlikely,
particularly
in
light
of
legislative
history
of
this
provision
for
those
justices
who
consider
such
considerations
relevant,
that
congress
meant
to
exclude
the
crime
of
assault.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
and
again,
two
responses:
the
first
is
as
a
practical
matter
that
is
not
a
crime.
normally
the
law
of
assault,
in
order
to
constitute
a
criminal
threat,
there
has
to
be
more
than
simply
the
use
of
words.
there
has
to
--
the
defendant
has
to
manifest
by
conduct.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct.
there
have
been
a
handful
of
cases,
that
are
cited
in
petitioner's
brief,
in
the
--
in
which
the
florida
statute
has
been
used
to
criminalize
rude
touchings.
we
think
that
those
rude
touchings,
as
a
matter
of
general
usage
in
the
common
law
and
in
the
general
definition
of
battery,
do
in
fact
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force.
that
is
a
usage
that
has
been
in
force
in
the
majority
of
states
for
quite
some
time.
and
we
think
that
it
does
no
particular
violence,
if
you
will
pardon
the
expression,
to
the
statute
to
interpret
it
to
encompass
the
full
range
of
common
law
batteries,
batteries
as
they
are
prosecuted--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--pick
pocketing
actually
doesn't
involve
a
touching
necessarily.
normally
if
you--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
pick
pocketing,
normally
as
it
is
criminalized
in
most
states,
does
not,
in
fact,
require
as
an
element
that
the
prosecution
prove
that
the
--
the
defendant
touched
the
victim.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
the
clumsy
pick
pocket
would,
in
fact,
be
in
most
jurisdictions
a
robber.
and
robbery
is
precisely
the
kind
of
offense
that
we
know
that
congress
was
intending
to
cover
in
subsection
1
of
the
acca.
it
was
one
of
the
first
acca
predicates,
and
it
remains,
i
think,
a
paradigmatic
example
of
a
crime
that
has
as
an
element
the
use
of
force
and
is,
therefore,
covered
under
the
plain
statutory
language.
but
i
think
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--but
i
think
that
the
essential
thrust
of
the
argument
so
far
has
been
that
if
it's
possible
to
commit
battery
under
the
common
law
under
the
laws
of
27
states,
including
florida,
under
federal
law
in
the
way
that
individual
instances
doesn't
seem
to
present
a
serious
risk
of
injury,
then
it
can't
possibly
be
a
violent
felony.
and
i
think
that
we
know
from
the
way
the
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
to
date
that
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
this
court
addressed
a
very
similar
argument
in
taylor--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
you
are
exactly
right,
that
the
inquiry
that
is
set
out
in
subsection
1
is
simply,
does
this
crime
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force?
our
submission
is
that
every
battery
under
florida
law,
under
common
law
and
under
the
laws
of
27
states
and
the
federal
government
does
have
an
--
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
right.
there
is
some
suggestion
in
judge
easterbrook's
opinion
that
that
usage
is
somehow
peculiar
to
newtonian
physics.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
it
is
actually
a
very
common
usage
in
the
criminal
law.
there
are
a
number
of
judicial
opinions,
for
example,
that
we
instead
of
using
the
formulation
that
we
see
in
florida's
battery
statute,
instead
use
the
formulation
use
of
force
of
the
slightest
degree.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that's
precisely
the
problem
with
the
petitioner's
submission.
it
creates
a
kind
of
required
element
under
the
acca
that
has
no
clear
parallels
in
the
substantive
criminal
law.
and
it
would
require
federal
sentencing
courts
to
ask
precisely
the
kinds
of
questions
the
law
of
battery
has
historically
thought
to
avoid,
just
how
much
physical
force
is
enough.
the
reason
why
a
statute
like
florida
has
reached
the
least
touching
of
another
in
anger
is
as
blackstone
told
us,
that
too
is
a
form
of
violence.
it
has
so
been
considered
for
centuries.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
to
return
to
your
question
earlier,
florida
itself
actually
does
classify
the
crime
of
battery
as
defined
under
its
statute
as
a
crime
of
violence
for
certain
purposes.
the
ordinary
understanding
of
the
crime
of
battery--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--it--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
we
think
that
both
variants
of
that
offense
in
your
hypothetical
would
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think,
first
of
all,
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
think
that
congress
defines
the
range
of
acca
predicate
with
particular
consideration
to
the
ways
that
hypothetical
defendants
might
--
might
commit
even
quintessentially
violent
crimes
in
particular
cases.
this
court,
for
example,
considered
in
taylor
v.
united
states
a
very
similar
argument,
which
was
that
the
statutory
reference
to
burglary
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
would
limit
it
to
aggravated
burglaries
of
a
certain
sort,
armed
burglaries
or
burglaries
of
occupied
buildings,
in
order
to
make
sure
that
that
reference
to
burglary
better
fit
with
congress's
purposes
in
selecting
the
worst
of
the
worst.
this
court
declined
that
invitation
because
it
decided
that
congress's
unmodified
views
of
the
word
"burglary"
indicated
that
congress
meant
for
that
word
to
take
on
its
ordinary
meaning
as
it
was
used
in
the
laws
of
the
many
states.
it
said
that
congress
would
have
recognized
that
ordinary
burglaries
can
be
committed
in
individual
instances
in
ways
that
don't
seem
particularly
harmful,
by
unarmed
defenders
of
unoccupied
buildings
in
remote
locations,
but
that
congress
nevertheless
made
a
categorical
judgment
that
burglaries
as
a
whole
present
sufficient
potential
for
harm
that
they
ought
to
be
covered
as
acca
predicates.
and
i
think
a
similar
analysis
applies
here.
congress
probably
wasn't
focused
on
the
least
amount
of
force
that
it
takes
to
commit
the
crime
of
battery,
but
it
was
entitled
to
make
a
judgment
that
any
battery,
any
unlawful
use
of
force
against
another
person,
categorically
presents
sufficient
potential
for
harm
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
the
response
is,
first,
we
think
that
the
proper
approach
is
one
that
pays
respect
to
the
words
that
congress
used
to
define
the
crime.
in
ordinary
criminal
law,
despite
what
some
intuitions
seem
to
be,
the
least
touching
of
another
in
anger
is
a
form
of
violence.
it
is
a
use
of
physical
force.
i
think
to
the
extent
that,
your
honor,
you
are
inclined
to
look
to
the
purposes
of
this
statute,
what
congress
would
have
thought
the
mind
run
of
cases
that
would
fall
under
subsection
1's
use
of
force
provision
would
cover,
i
think
there
you
look
at
the
reported
cases
in
florida,
we
see
that
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
are
prosecuted
under
the
touching
or
striking
prong
of
that
statute
are,
in
fact,
quite
harmful.
it's
not
at
all
difficult
to
see
why
congress
would
have
been
concerned
about
these
types
of
crimes,
both
because
in
many
instances
they
involve
conduct
that
is
probably
better
described
as
touching
or
striking
but
it
is
--
nevertheless
risks
substantial
harm
to
the
victim,
like
choking,
like
beating
the
victim's
head
against
the
car
window,
to
use
an
example
from
one
of
those
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
it
probably
is
not
the
way
that
we
ordinarily
talk
in
day-to-day
conversation,
but
it
certainly
is
the
way
that
the
law
has
talked
about
it
for
centuries,
and
i
think
there
is
a
reason
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
technical
definition
of
battery
rather
than
ordinary
parlance,
if
for
no
other
reason
because
it
tracked
so
closely
the
general
definition,
that
technical
definition
of
1.
and
also
because
now
that
the--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that,
justice
stevens.
i
do
think
that
one
reason
why
the
misdemeanor
versus
felony
distinction
is
somewhat
unimportant
to
the
interpretation
of
the
18
u.s.c.
16,
which
by
its
terms,
applies
to
both
misdemeanors
and
felonies,
and
congress
has
of
course
subsequently
used
that
very
same
language
to
define
a
class
of
misdemeanor
crimes
of
domestic
violence
in
section
922(g)(9),
we
think
to
the
extent
that
this
court
is
inclined
to
interpret
the
extent
of
the
similar
language
in
the
similar
statutes
in
a
similar
manner,
the
use
of
physical
force
language
should
remain
consistent
across
them.
one
of
the
principal
vices
of
petitioner's
arguments
is
also
that
it
would
leave
the
federal
domestic
violence
provisions
like
section
922(g)(9)
with
relatively
patchwork
and
haphazard
application,
which
is
precisely
one
of
the
considerations
that
motivated
this
court's
decision
just
last
term
in
the
united
states
v.
hayes.
whether
the
court--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--there
are
--
the
range
of
predicate
offenses
that
can
be
used
for
the
section
922(g)(9)
domestic
gun
violence
prohibition,
ordinarily,
as
this
court
recognized
in
hayes,
encompasses
the
general
assault
and
battery
statutes
of
the
united
states.
twenty-seven
of
these
states
define
battery
in
more
or
less
the
way
that
florida
does,
to
include
a
range
of
uses
of
physical
force
from
the
least
degree
of
physical
force
to
very
severe
beatings,
so
under
petitioner's
reading,
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
for
sure
in
more
than
half
of
the
country
that
a
domestic
violence
conviction,
even
a
battery
conviction
that
is
specifically
denominated
as
a
domestic
violence
battery
conviction
in
many
a
state,
would
qualify
under
section
922(g)(9).
it
seems
unlikely
that
congress,
in
enacting
that
statute,
which
was
designed
to
create
a
nationwide
solution
to
the
nationwide
problem
of
the
combination
of
guns
and
domestic
strife,
would
have
intended
for
that
statute
to
have
such
a
haphazard
impact.
and
yet
that
is
precisely
what
the
effect
of
petitioner's
reading
would
be.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
is.
it's
in
the
statutory
appendix
to
the
gray
brief.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
the--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--it's
on
page
3(a)
of
the
statutory
appendix.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
contains
section
921(a)(33)(a),
which
provides
the
definition
of
"misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence".
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct.
the
substantive
prohibition
is
in
section
922(g)(9),
and
the
definitional
provision
is
reprinted
on
page
3(a).
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
it's
within
the
court's
discretion
to
decide
how
to
dispose
properly
of
the
case.
i
think
that
the
section
--
the
subsection
2
issue
was
preserved
in
the
courts
below.
the
district
court
rested
its
decision
on
both
subsections
1
and
2,
and
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
only
subsection
1.
we
think
that
if
the
court
decides
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
its
interpretation
of
subsection
1,
then
the
appropriate
thing
in
order
to
determine
what
petitioner's
correct
sentencing
should
be
would
be
to
remand
to
allow
the
court
of
appeals
to
address
the
alternative
argument
about
subsection
2.
but
the
reason
why
the
subsection
1
inquiry
is
so--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--certainly.
i
think
that
rule
15.2
of
the
rules
of
this
court
requires
us
in
a
brief
in
opposition
to
raise
any
material
matters
that
relate
to
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
concerns
just
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
which
was
subsection
(1)
of
the
statute.
we
think
it's
not
at
all
unusual
for
this
court
to
decide
that
a
court
of
appeals
judgment
is
in
error
and
then
remand
to
allow
the
court
of
appeals
to
address--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
it's
difficult
to
read
those
four
words
in
that
manner,
justice
breyer.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
if
for
no
reason
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
so
much
as
acknowledge
the
existence--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--it
was
argued.
it
was
--
it
was
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
it's
--
again,
it's
difficult
to
read
that
piece
of
loose
language
in
the
court's
opinion
as
a
direct
holding,
particularly
considering
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
so
much
as
cite
the
language
or
even
the
code
provision
that
relates
to
the
argument.
but
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
court
questions
whether
it
would
qualify
under
subsection
(2),
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
battery
is
--
qualifies
under
this
court's
interpretations
of
that
subsection
in
chambers
and
begay
and
james.
it
is
a
crime
that
is
typically
purposeful,
violent
and
aggressive.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
it
is
like
them
in
that
it
poses
risks
that
are
similar
in--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
i
think
it
would
still
be
consistent
with
this
court's
analysis
of
subsection
(2)
in
begay
in
that
battery
by
touching,
if
you
consider
it
to
be
a
separate
crime,
which
again
i
think
is
a
highly
contested--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
but
what
this
court
said
in
begay
was
that
it
doesn't
present
risks
that
are
similar
in
degree
and
kind
to
the
risks
that
are
presented
by
the
enumerated
offenses.
and
battery,
including
battery
by
touching
or
striking
under
florida
law,
presents
risks
that
are
quite
similar
in
degree
and
kind
to
the
enumerated
offenses,
particularly
burglary.
it
is--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
--
first
of
all,
to
clear
up
a
misconception,
simply
because
the
statutory
text
covers
the
slightest
touching
doesn't
mean
that
it
covers
only
the
slightest
touching.
it
covers
a
wide
range
of
degrees
of
physical
force
beginning
with
the
slightest
touching
and
including--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--right.
and
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
concerns
only
that
question.
it
concerns
the
proper
interpretation
of
subsection
(1).
whether
the
crime
is
one
that
has
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i'm
not
entirely
sure
why
that
would
be
true.
but
i
do
think
that
it's
right
as
a
descriptive
matter
that
most
of
the
crimes
that
are
encompassed
by
subsection
(1)
would
also
qualify
under
subsection
(2).
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
you
have
to
look
at
the
contact
that
the
person
was
convicted
of
with
respect
to
the
elements
of
the
crime,
that
is
the
nature
of
the
category--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
is
incorrect.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
subsection
(2)
like
subsection
(1)
proceeds
by
looking
at
the
elements
of
the
offense--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--just
at
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
which
the
defendant
was
convicted.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
justice
scalia,
i
would
certainly
be
inclined
to
agree
with
you
but
it's
particularly
clear
given
the
text
and
context
of
the
purposes
of
section
922(g)(9)
that
battery
ought
to
be
covered
by
that
definition,
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
but
we
think
that
the
reason
why
it
is
also
clear
under
subsection
(1)
of
the
acca
is
that
the
use
of
force
element
of
the
definitional
provision
is
separate
from
the
degree
of
seriousness
with
which
the
state
chooses
to
treat
the
crime,
yet
the
crime
is
punished
as
a
felony,
and
if
has
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force,
then
it
qualifies
as
a
violent
felony
under
the
acca,
just
as
if
it
is
punished
as
a
misdemeanor,
it
qualifies
as
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence
under
section
922(g)(9).
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
the
court
in
united
states
v.
rodriguez
in
analyzing
the
coordinate
provision
of
the
acca
that
covers
serious
drug
offenses
said
that
the
felony
aspect
of
that
definition
is
satisfied
by
a
recidivist
enhancement.
and
we
think
that
the
conclusion
in
that
case,
and
it
is
not
disputed
among
the
parties,
applies
with
equal
force
in
this
case
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
violent
felony.
but
it
was
certainly
true
by
the
time
that
congress
enacted
the
acca,
which
the
legislative
history
indicates
congress
understood
would
cover
assault
crimes,
for
example,
that
there
were
certain
kinds
of
batteries
and
assaults
that,
although
otherwise
may
be
punished
as
simple
batteries
and
assaults,
as
misdemeanors,
could
be
elevated
to
a
felony
if
for
example
they
were
committed
against
a
law
enforcement
officer.
it
simply
was
not
unheard
of
for
simple
battery
to
be
elevated
to
a
felony
under
certain
circumstances
in
1986
congress
enacted
the
present
version
of
acca.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
think
that
congress
--
every
indication
that
we
have
in
both
the
text,
the
context,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
its
background
suggests
that
congress
was
in
fact
deliberately
tracking
the
definition
of
battery
when
it
enacted
the
primary
definition
of
violent
felony
in
subsection
(1).
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
aside
from
the
fact
that
they
didn't
use
the
word
battery.
instead
they
chose
to
incorporate
the
general
definition
of
the
crime
of
battery;
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
inclined
to
restrict
the
terms
of
--
that
congress
chose
to
use
itself
to
physical
force
as
only
exceeding
a
certain
threshold,
to
include
some
batteries
and
not
other
batteries,
the
court
would
be
setting
up
a
very
difficult
test
for
federal
sentencing
courts
to
apply
in
the
real
world.
essentially--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted,
states
don't
have
quite
the
same
compulsion
to
sort
different
factual
offenses
into
different
boxes.
prosecutors,
as
the
prosecutor
did
in
this
case,
can
use
either
of
the
two
alternative
prongs
of
florida's
battery
definition
to
punish
what
is
essentially
the
same
offense,
which
is
the
crime
of
battery,
that
deserves
the
same
punishment
regardless
of
which
prong
the
prosecutor
proceeds
under,
whether
the
bodily
injury
prong
or
the
touching
or
striking
prong.
and
petitioner's
concession
that
at
least
federal
sentencing
courts
could
draw
distinctions
between
touches
and
strikes,
may
have
some
resonance
in
the
state
of
florida,
but
has
resonance
for
the
rest
of
the
country.
most
state
assault
and
battery
statutes
don't
contain
explicit
references
to
striking,
but
subsume
striking
within
the
range
of
conduct
prescribed
by
their
offensive
touching
prong.
so
it
simply
wouldn't
be
possible,
in
most
cases,
for
a
court
to
look
at
the
cold
record
of
the
underlying
state
conviction
and
try
to
discern
exactly
how
much
force
was
involved
in
the
offense
and
whether
that
force
satisfied
the
petitioner's
proposed
threshold,
whatever
it
means.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
principal
question
before
the
court
is
one
that
is,
primarily,
relevant
to
the
section
922(g)(9)
provision
and
other
federal
misdemeanor
domestic
violence
provisions
and
one
that
we
think,
in
considering
the
purposes
of
those
statutes
and
the
very
serious
dangers
that
they
address,
the
court
ought
to
interpret
the
plain
text
of
the
statutes
in
light
of
their
plain
meaning.
