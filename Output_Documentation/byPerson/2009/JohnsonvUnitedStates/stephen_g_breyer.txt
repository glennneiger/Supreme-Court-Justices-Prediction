justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
--
what
--
before
we
can
even
get
into
this,
i
think
we
have
to
decide
if
those
words
"striking
or
touching"
describe
one
crime
or
two.
and
what
we
said
in
chambers
is
that
the
nature
of
the
behavior
that
likely
underlies
a
statutory
phrase
matters
in
this
respect.
if
you
think
of
the
seven
different
things
covered
by
one
statute
in
james
or
chambers,
two
of
them,
failing
to
return
from
a
furlough
and
failing
to
return
from
work
in
day
release,
seem
to
me
quite
possibly
to
describe
one
thing,
not
two.
now,
how
do
we
know
that
striking
or
touching
describes
two
things?
i
couldn't
find
any
instance,
and
we
had
the
library
looking.
i
couldn't
find
any
instance
in
florida
where
those
two
things
have
ever
been
charged
separately.
and
they
looked
at
hundreds.
so
--
so
why
do
we
think
it's
two
crimes,
rather
than
just
one
called
"striking
or
touching"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does,
too,
in
chambers.
it's
"not
returning
from
furlough
or
not
returning
from
work
release.
"
you
know,
and
i'd
--
i
would
say
the
behavior
is
the
same.
it's
not
like
burglary
of
a
dwelling
versus
burglary
of
a
boat.
those
are
two
separate
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here,
why
do
you
think
they
are
two
separate
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
they
are
separate
things,
what
is
the
evidence?
there
is
a
legal
question.
you
say
the
touching.
spitting,
is
that
enough
to
rise
under
the
--
to
fall
within
the
federal
statute?
suppose
i
agree
with
you
on
that;
the
answer's
no.
how
do
i
know
whether
touching
as
applied
in
florida
as
a
separate
matter
in
the
mine
run
of
cases,
involves
spitting
or
involves
something
that
causes
far
more
serious
harm?
how
do
i
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
--
most
--
this
statute
actually,
we
looked
into
it
and
it
seems
to
be
used,
particularly
the
touching
part,
also
to
cover
unwelcome
physical,
sexual
advances.
and
it's
not
hard
to
consider
such
matters
to
have
involved
force
of
exactly
the
kind
that
the
federal
statute
is
aimed
at.
and
there
was
no
striking,
but
there
was
in
fact
use
of
harmful
force,
touching.
that
was
serious.
now,
how
do
we
know
which
is
more
normally
the
case
when
this
statute
is
used
in
its
touching
respect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
that's
certainly
wrong
under
our
cases.
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
reason
that
burglary,
for
example,
is
a
violent
crime
is
not
because
in
every
instance
there
is
a
risk
of
physical
harm,
because
in
the
mine
run
of
instances
there
is
a
risk
of
physical
harm,
and
i
thought
we
said
that
in
at
least
three
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
an
element
--
you
mean
we
should
interpret
"element"
in
the
first
part
of
this
in
a
radically
different
way
than
we
have
interrupted
equivalent
words
in
the
second
part,
and
we
should
say
that
burglary
--
in
other
words,
assault
or
--
or
--
in
other
words,
unless
in
every
case
of
prosecution
there
is
going
to
be
force
actually
applied
or
something
like
that,
that
it
doesn't
fall
within
one?
i'm
surprised
at
it.
i
mean,
i
guess
it's
possible.
what
would
be
the
argument
for
doing
that,
which
would
be
totally
different
than
we
have
handled
the
other
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
what
about
an
assault?
i
guess,
using
a
law
school
hypothetical,
i
mean,
a
statute
for
assault
--
i
guess
you
could
assault
somebody
by
threatening
to
throw
a
marshmallow
at
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
assault
is
out
of
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
i
mean,
on
your
definition,
as
you
and
justice
scalia
were
suggesting,
because
it
is
conceivable
that
you
could
assault
somebody
by
threatening
to
throw
a
marshmallow,
that
means
assault
is
no
longer
a
crime
of
violence,
and
that
can't
be
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
assault
is
not
a
crime
of
violence;
it's
not
a
use
of
force.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
attempted
murder?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
didn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
what
worries
me
more
than
--
than
your
application
to
battery
is
the
methodology,
because,
if
it's
true
that
in
section
1,
unlike
section
2,
a
single
instance
of
where
you
could
commit
the
crime
without
using
force
is
sufficient
to
take
it
out
of
the
statute,
then,
just
looking
through
this,
generally,
you
would
take
out
assault,
probably
have
to
take
out
kidnapping.
you
would
probably
have
to
take
out
domestic
violence.
you
would
have
to
take
out
extortion,
certainly,
explosives
laws.
i
mean,
the
very
--
laws
that
i
would
think
congress
certainly
intended
to
include
in
that
first
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
very
worrying,
and
why
i
don't
think
it's
the
right
methodology.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
an
element
could
be
an
element
that
is
a
--
the
word
is
"element",
the
use
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force.
now,
an
element,
say
like
abduction,
could
be
an
element
that
uses
physical
force
if
in
the
mine
run
of
cases
it
uses
physical
force,
even
though
one
can
sometimes
think
of
an
exception.
that's
how
we
have
interpreted
2.
so
if
we
interpret
1
a
different
way,
we
are
going
to
take
outside
the
statute
the
very
things
that
congress
wanted
inside;
and,
if
we
interpret
it
the
same
way,
i
think
we
would
get
to
the
right
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rape
can
be
convicted
without
--
rape
can
be
conducted
without
force.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now
rape
is
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
element
of
rape
is
not
force;
it's
lack
of
consent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
do?
you
agree
that,
then
--
in
other
words,
section
2
is
not
about
property
crimes
that
involve
force,
which
is
what
congress
happened
to
say
nonstop
in
the
legislative
history,
which
i
know
isn't
read
by
everyone.
but
it
seemed
to
me
reading
that
history,
the
first
part
is
dealing
with
those
things
that
aren't
property
crimes.
the
second
part,
like
arson,
extortion,
which
they
had
in
mind
of
a
certain
kind,
and
whatever,
the
explosives-related
things,
were
things
that
they
thought
didn't
--
could
be
property
crimes
that
also
involved
harm
to
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
can't
say
yes
to
both
of
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
wouldn't
have
to
say
that.
they
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
crime
like
the
three
that
are
mentioned,
which
i
can't
remember
--
it's
arson,
extortion
--
and
what's
the
third?
using
explosives.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
burglary,
arson,
extortion
--
all
right.
you
would
say
it's
not
like
that.
it's
dui;
it
was
not
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
get--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
we
interpret
the
statute,
the
act
of
the
statute
as
requiring
more
force
than
that,
as
requiring
something
more
than
spitting.
now,
suppose
that
sometimes,
as
they
have
made
a
strong
case,
that
touching
is
a
separate
thing
under
this
statute
because
that's
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
and
moreover,
there
are
prosecutions
that
seem
not
to
fit
within
striking.
how
do
we
know
whether
by
and
large
this
were
a
touching
as
used
in
florida,
covers
things
with
mostly
minimal
touching,
minimal
force
or
enough
force
to
get
within
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might
have,
but
battery
by
touching
does
seem
a
separate
category.
and
at
that
point,
you
have
to
decide,
is
there
an
element
there
of
force?
and
i
think
it
requires
more
force
than
just
the
simplest
touching.
now,
on
justice
scalia's
approach,
the
fact
that
there
is
one
conviction
for
spitting
is
sufficient
to
take
it
outside
the
statute.
that's
not
my
approach.
i
would
say,
in
the
mind
run
of
cases,
does
there
have
to
be
more
force
than
just
spitting?
and
now
i
don't
know
how
it's
prosecuted.
so
why
don't
i
say
in
this
case,
from
my
perspective,
very
well,
i
don't
know.
no
one
knows.
no
one
has
told
me.
no
one
has
looked
into
it.
it's
very
hard
to
look
into,
but
not
impossible.
it's
the
government's
job,
faced
with
a
15-year
statute,
to
do
the
looking.
they
have
the
resources.
more
than
a
defense
attorney.
therefore,
uncertain
as
i
am,
i
must
decide
this
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
hear
what
they
said,
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
it
said
that
if
battery
under
florida
law
fits
within
the
description
of
(1),
then
it
is
a
violent
crime
for
acca
purposes.
and
then
it
says
if
not,
then
not.
and
as
long
as
the
issue
was
in
front
of
them
i
would
think
that
those
last
four
words
are
a
holding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
it
argued?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
pretty
hard
to
see
it
given
begay,
how
this
is
like
arson
or,
you
know,
the
other
three
there,
burglary,
arson--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--explosives.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
felt
--
what
they
said
was,
"if
not,
then
not".
and
it
was
raised
in
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
i
--
i
thought
--
you
know,
it's
--
it's
like
the
other
four
listed
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
we
are
rereading
these
three
other
examples
out
because
then
"other"
covers
any
crime
that
poses
a
risk
of
violence,
or
whatever
the
words
are
there
--
i
forget
the
words.
poses
a
risk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
think
drunk
driving
doesn't
present
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury?
