justice
antonin
scalia
this
--
this
statute
is
a
misdemeanor
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
and
the
only
reason
what
happened
here
was
elevated
to
a
felony
was
that
he
had
a
prior
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
understandable
that
the
slightest
touch
could
--
could
constitute
a
misdemeanor.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
don't
have
to
know
what's
more
normal
anyway,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
any
conviction
is
possible
under
the
element
of
the
crime
to
touch,
when
there
is
simply
slight
physical
force,
your
argument
still
stands,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
it's
right.
you
don't
have
to
touch
somebody
for
an
assault.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
just
threaten
somebody.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
crime
of
violence.
ms.
call:
and
that
would
be--
--of
course
it's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
a
separate
--
a
separate
battery
crime,
aggravated
battery,
in
--
in
florida,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
a
felony
battery
statute.
this
is
a
misdemeanor
battery
statute,
which
has
been
elevated
to
a
felony
in
this
case
only
because
the
fellow
had
a
prior.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
besides
the
misdemeanor
battery
statute,
there
are
two
felony
battery
statutes
in
florida,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
--
how
are
they
defined?
justice
antonin
scalia
misdemeanor
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
would
have
to
have
other
states
which
only
have
a
battery
statute
that
is
defined
as
broadly
as
this
misdemeanor
battery
statute
in
florida.
if
they
have
a
higher
degree
of
battery,
just
as
florida
does,
which
is
a
felony,
then,
if
the
--
if
the
prosecutor
wants
this
fellow
to
be
convicted
of
a
violent
crime,
he
--
he
could
charge
him
with
that
--
with
that
higher
degree.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
states
that
have
only
this
simple
battery
statute,
which
is
--
which
is
met
by
a
simple
touching?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
you
mistook
my
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
states
in
which
the
only
prosecution
for
battery
that
can
be
brought
is
under
a
statute
as
broad
as
this
one,
which
is
--
is
covered
by
even
a
touching?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
all
of
the
other
states
that
have
a
touching
statute
also
have
higher
degree
of
battery
statutes?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
use
battery
in
the
statute
here?
i
am
looking
for
it.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
the
word
"battery"
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
under
1
it
depends
upon
the
elements,
but
what
about
2
and
especially
the
residual
provision
of
2,
"any
other
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another?
"
i
would
think
rape
qualifies
under
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
many
of
the
other
crimes
that
justice
breyer
has
been
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
dare
say
that
the
next
time
somebody
comes
to
argue
before
this
court
that
a
crime
is
not
included
within
section
2
because
it's
not
a
property
crime,
i
don't
think
that
person
is
going
to
get
one
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
they
all
had
such
--
such
aggravated
statutes
in
your
answer
to
me.
now
you
just
said
many
of
them
do.
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
--
you
would
have
us
believe
that
by
"violent
felony"
in
this
--
in
this
statute,
congress
meant
the
threat
--
the
threat?
it
doesn't
even
have
to
be
the
act.
you
know,
if
you
don't
shut
up,
i
am
going
to
come
over
and
thwonk
you
on
your
shoulder
with
my
index
finger.
i'm
going
to
(snap).
this
is
a
violent
felony
under
this
statute
which
gets
him
how
many
more
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
fifteen
years
for
(snap).
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
all
he's
necessarily
been
convicted
of.
when
a
verdict
is
brought
in
in
florida
under
this
misdemeanor
statute,
all
you
know
for
sure
is
that
he
threatened
to
go
(snap).
that's
all
you
know
for
sure
that
he
has
been
convicted
of,
and
you
are
going
to
give
him
15
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you
don't
prosecute
them
for
pick
pocketing.
you
have
a
clumsy
pick
pocket
and
you
prosecute
him
for
battery,
right?
and
he
gets
15
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
guess
it
comes
down
to
whether
we
think
that
in
--
in
b1,
congress
was
using
technical
language
or
congress
was
using
simply
ordinary
language,
because
you
are
quite
right
that
the
definition
of
--
of
battery
covers
even
the
slightest
touching.
the
use
of
physical
force,
which
would
include
the
slightest
touching.
but
in
using
that
definition
to
define
the
term
"violent
felony",
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
congress
was
using
the
term
in
a
technical
sense,
and
was
not
using
the
term
"physical
force",
"the
use
of
physical
force"
to
mean
something
more
than
a
mere
touching.
but
that's
--
that's
basically
what
we
are
arguing,
isn't
it?
whether
that
--
whether
that
phrase
there,
"threatened
use
of
physical"
--
"use
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force.
"
is
technical
language
which
is
the
definition
of
battery,
or
rather
more
common
usage.
you
--
you
would
acknowledge
that,
that
in
more
common
usage,
no
one
--
no
one
would
think
that
if
you
go
over
to
somebody
and
point
your
finger
at
him
on
his
lapel
and
say,
"now,
you
listen
to
me.
"
that
that
would
be
considered
the
use
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
the
provision?
922(g)(9),
is
that
in
your
brief
somewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
looking
for
it.
i
don't
see
it.
922(g)(9).
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hate
people
talking
about
statutes
that
i
don't
have
in
front
of
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
3(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
922.
that's
what
i
thought
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
explosives.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
(2)
--
(2)
looks
to
the
conduct,
it
doesn't
look
to
the
element
of
the
crime.
so
you
could
actually
look
to
the
conduct
of
which
the
person
was
convicted,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
you
look
to
the
crime
--
under
(1),
you
look
to
the
crime
he
was
convicted
of,
and
if
--
if
--
if
none
of
its
elements
require
serious
physical
force,
you
can
say
it
doesn't
qualify
under
(1),
but
under
(2)
if
in
fact
you
see
the
misdemeanor
he
was
convicted
of
was
really
whacking
somebody
really
hard,
then
--
then
it
could
possibly
come
within
--
come
under
(2).
justice
antonin
scalia
just
at
the
elements.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
about
--
about
922?
you
point
to
the
--
the
definition
there,
the
definition
in
921.
but
that
is
a
definition
of
the
term,
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
and
in
the
context
of
defining
that
term,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
believe
that
the
use
or
attempted
use
of
physical
force
means
even
the
slightest
touching,
as
--
as
battery
does.
you
are
talking
about
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
but
what
we
have
before
us
here
is
a
term
--
a
different
term
that
is
being
defined
and
that
term
is
violent
felony.
and
i
find
it
a
lot
harder
to
swallow
that
--
that
that
definition
embraces
merely
the
slightest
touching.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
dare
say
that
congress
in
my
view
probably
didn't
even
contemplate
that
something
which
is
a
misdemeanor
could
become
a
violent
felony
if
you
did
it
the
second
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
approved
that,
by
the
way,
kicking
it
up
to
the
felony
category
simply
because
of
recidivism?
justice
antonin
scalia
states
do
it
all
the
time
when
they
have
different
degrees
of
battery.
misdemeanor
--
felony
battery
--
they
do
it
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitioner
curtis
johnson
pleaded
guilty
to
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
ammunition
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.,
section
922(g)(1).
the
government
sought
an
enhanced
penalty
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
which
provides
that
a
person
who
violates
section
922(g)
and
who
has
three
previous
convictions
for
a
violent
felony,
that’s
a
crucial
language,
shall
be
imprisoned
for
a
minimum
of
fifteen
years
and
a
maximum
of
life.
the
act
defines
a
violent
felony
to
include
among
other
things
a
felony
offense
which
quote
“has
as
an
element
the
use
attempted
use
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force
against
the
person
of
another.”
the
government
proffered
three
prior
felony
convictions
to
establish
johnson's
eligibility
for
sentencing
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
johnson
did
not
dispute
the
two
of
those
convictions
qualified
as
violent
felonies,
but
he
objected
to
third,
namely
a
2003
felony
conviction
in
florida
for
battery.
that
conviction
was
for
simple
battery
under
florida
law
which
ordinarily
is
a
first
degree
misdemeanor,
but
is
a
third
degree
felony
for
a
defendant
who
has,
as
johnson
had,
been
convicted
of
battery,
even
simple
battery,
previously.
under
florida
law
the
elements
of
battery
may
be
satisfied
in
one
of
three
ways.
a
person
actually
and
intentionally
strikes
another
person;
he
intentionally
causes
bodily
harm
to
another
person
or
and
this
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
he
actually
and
intentionally
touches
another
person.
nothing
in
the
record
of
johnson's
2003
battery
conviction
permitted
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
it
rested
upon
anything
more
than
the
least
of
these
acts,
touching,
which
the
florida
supreme
court
has
held
is
satisfied
by
any
intentional
physical
contact,
no
matter
how
slight.
under
florida
law,
this
is
a
quote
from
the
supreme
court
“a
tap
on
the
shoulder
without
consent
establishes
a
battery.”
accordingly,
johnson's
conviction
was
a
predicate
violent
felony
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
only
if
intentionally
touching
another
person
constitutes
the
use
of
physical
force
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
district
court
concluded
that
it
does
and
sentenced
johnson
to
a
prison
term
of
15
years
and
5
months.
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed,
we
granted
certiorari.
the
armed
career
criminal
act
contains
no
statutory
definition
of
physical
force
and
we
therefore
give
that
phrase
its
ordinary
meaning.
the
adjective
physical
is
clear
in
meaning;
it
is
the
noun
force
that
poses
the
difficulty.
force
has
a
number
of
meanings.
we
exclude
its
specialized
meaning
in
the
field
of
physics,
a
cause
of
the
acceleration
of
mass.
in
more
general
usage
it
refers
to
strength
and
power
of
an
unusual
degree
and
to
violence
directed
against
a
person
or
thing.
the
ordinary
usage
of
the
word
therefore
suggests
a
degree
of
power
that
would
not
be
satisfied
by
the
merest
touching
such
as
a
tap
on
the
shoulder.
there
is
however
a
more
specialized
legal
usage
of
the
word
force.
it’s
used
in
describing
one
of
the
elements
of
the
common-law
crime
of
battery
which
consisted
of
the
intentional
application
of
unlawful
force
that
was
the
definition,
against
the
person
of
another.
the
common
law
held
that
this
element
of
force
was
satisfied
by
even
the
slightest
offensive
touching.
we
do
not
believe
the
term
‘force’
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act
has
the
specialized
meaning
that
it
bore
in
the
common-law
definition
of
battery.
although,
common-law
term
of
art
should
be
given
its
established
common-law
meaning,
we
do
not
force
term
of
art
definitions
into
contexts
where
they
plainly
do
not
fit.
here
we
are
interpreting
the
phrase
physical
force
as
used
in
defining
not
the
crime
of
battery,
but
rather
the
statutory
category
of
violent
felonies.
we
think
it's
clear
that
in
the
context
of
the
statutory
definition
of
violent
felony,
the
phrase
‘physical
force’
means
violent
force
that
is
force
capable
of
causing
physical
pain
or
injury
to
another
person.
even
by
itself
the
word
violent
connotes
a
substantial
degree
of
force.
when
the
adjective
violent
is
attached
to
the
noun
felony,
its
connotation
of
strong
physical
force
is
even
clear.
it
is
significant
moreover
that
the
common-law
crime
of
battery
to
which
the
specialized
meaning
of
force
was
attached
was
a
misdemeanor.
it
is
unlikely
that
congress
would
select
as
a
term
of
art
defining
violent
felony,
a
phrase
that
the
common-law
gave
peculiar
meaning
only
in
its
definition
of
a
misdemeanor.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
