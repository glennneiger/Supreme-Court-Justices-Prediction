justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
this,
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
point?
are
there
any
other
crimes
other
than
battery
that
--
that
create
the
same
situation
where
in
the
first
time
it
is
committed
it's
a
misdemeanor,
but
then
it
becomes
a
felony
because
it's
committed
twice?
so
what
we
have
here
is
conduct
that
first
time
is
misdemeanor,
second
time
is
a
felony.
are
there
any
other
examples
of
crimes
that
fit
that
category
that
come
within
subparagraph
1?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
district
court
thought
that
the
two
were
related.
the
district
court,
if
it
thought
a
slightest
touching
was
qualified
under
(1)
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
say
that
it
would
also
qualify
under
(2).
but
if
that
argue
ment
is
rejected
under
(1),
it
seems
to
me
it
would
follow
necessarily
that
it
would
also
be
rejected
under
(2).
