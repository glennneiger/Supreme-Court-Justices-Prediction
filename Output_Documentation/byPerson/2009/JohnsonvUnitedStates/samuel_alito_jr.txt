well,
acca
uses
the
words
"physical
force",
and
any
touching
involves
some
physical
force.
now,
how
do
we
determine
how
much
more
than
the
minimum
physical
force
is
necessary
in
order
to
fall
within
the
federal
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
there
were
a
state
statute
that
made
it
a
battery
to
engage
in
offensive
and
unwelcome
sexual
touching,
your
argument
would
be
that
that
would
not
fall
within
the
first
prong
of
acca,
because
there
is
not
a
--
it's
not
likely
to
cause
a
physical
injury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
there
was
a
statute
that
said
--
in
the
old
days
i'm
told
people
used
to
throw
the
contents
of
chamber
pots
out
the
window.
if
there
were
a
--
a
state
statute
that
said
it
is
a
crime
to
dump
the
contents
of
a
chamber
pot
on
somebody's
head,
you
would
say
that's
--
that
doesn't
fall
within
the
first
prong
of
acca?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
--
those
are
classic
batteries--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
the
language
of
the
first
prong
of
acca
really
tracks
the
language
of
the
common
law
crime
of
battery?
