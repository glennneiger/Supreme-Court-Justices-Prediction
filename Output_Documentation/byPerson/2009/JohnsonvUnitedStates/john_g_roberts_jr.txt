chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-6925,
johnson
v.
united
states.
ms.
call.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
about
the
government's
argument
that
your
interpretation
would
dramatically
limit
the
reach
of
this
provision
of
acca
because
of
the
number
of
states
that
define
battery
in
the
same
way
florida
does?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
it's
--
it's
usually
easier
just
to
charge
the
lowest
common
denominator,
the
battery
that
doesn't
necessarily
require
violent
force,
and
the
point
--
this
was
the
argument
that
was
accepted
in
--
in
hayes,
that
the
interpretation,
say,
advanced
by
the
dissent
in
that
case,
would
mean
that
there
be
a
vast
number
of
states
that
weren't
covered.
i
mean,
presumably,
congress
meant
to
cover
all
the
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
the
evidence
was
pretty
clear
that
congress
was
adopting
the
common
law
definition
of
battery
here,
which
doesn't
require
that
higher
degree
of
force
or
violence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
why
didn't
they
say
--
why
didn't
they
just
say
battery,
if
that's
what
they
meant?
it's
a
lot
simpler
and
also
clearer
than
to
say
physical
force
against
the
person.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wait,
i
don't
follow
that
at
all.
i
mean,
i
understand
your
argument
that
physical
force
means
the
slightest
touching,
but
i
don't
understand
the
argument
that
the
slightest
touching
presents
a
serious
risk
of
potential
physical
injury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
your
argument
is
to
try
--
is
asserting
that
the
slightest
physical
touching
is
covered
by
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
every
indication
except
for
the
fact
that
they
didn't
use
the
word
battery.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
call,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-6925,
johnson
versus
united
states.
