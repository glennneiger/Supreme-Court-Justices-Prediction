and
that's
--
you
say
that's
federal
law.
would
it
make
a
difference
if,
contra
what
florida
held
in
the
hearns
case,
a
state
had
typed
a
battery
statute
as
a
crime
of
violence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no,
no.
it's
exactly
the
--
it's
exactly
the
statute
florida
has.
and
somebody
has
a
plea,
and
we
don't
know
from
the
record
what
the
conduct
was.
but
the
state,
unlike
florida,
says,
our
battery
statute
for
our
state
law
purposes
is
a
crime
of
violence;
therefore,
for
our
state
law
enhancements
the
person
who
pleads
guilty
to
a
battery
offense
will
be
deemed
one
who
has
committed
a
crime
of
violence,
if
that's
the
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
we
knew
--
knew
what
happened.
it's
the
same
statute,
and
it
would
be
possible
to
have
a
conviction
for
a
rude
touching
under
it.
but
this
man,
instead
of
pleading
guilty,
in
fact
went
to
trial,
and
we
know
that
he
beat
somebody
badly.
if
--
if
that
were
the
case,
if
we
knew
what
the
facts
were,
then
would
the
acca
enhancement
be
in
order?
the
statute
covers
the
waterfront
from
a
rude
touching
to
beating
somebody
to
a
bloody
pulp.
but
we
know,
because
there's
been
a
trial,
exactly
what
this
person
does,
and
what
he
does
would
fall
under
the
aggressive
violence,
capable
of
doing
physical
injury
to
another.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
just
clarify
an
answer
that
you
gave.
you
described
florida
as
unique,
but
i
thought
there
were
many
states
that
had
a
codification
of
common
law
battery
that
would
include
both
touching
and
more
aggressive
behavior.
i
thought
florida
was
not
alone
in
having
that
kind
of
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
have
been
rude
touchings
where
there
is
no
danger
of
physical
injuries
to
the
person.
there
have
been
prosecutions
in
florida,
i
understand,
for
what
would
be
considered
a
rude
touching
as
opposed
to
an
aggressive
use
of
force
that
would
risk
physical
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
for
recidivism.
not
for
recidivism
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
you
saying
that
suppose
to
florida
split
this
statute,
and
some
states
do,
so
one
crime
is
a
rude
touching
crime,
and
the
other
is
the
use
of
physical
--
aggressive
physical
force
that
endangers
the
physical
safety
of
another.
if
you
have
both
of
those
statutes,
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
either
one
of
them
would
fit
under
acca
as
a
crime
that
has
the
use
of
physical
force,
because
you
are
saying
the
rude
touching
is
physical
force?
even
if
you
split
off
the
touching
from
the
striking,
you
would
say
that
the
touching
falls
under
acca?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
the
worse
of
the
worst
in
acca,
the
armed
career,
whatever
--
that
they
meant
to
get
after
people
who
go
around
poking
other
people
in
a
rude
manner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
no
provisions
that
would
include
domestic
violence
and
the
gun
possession
provision.
