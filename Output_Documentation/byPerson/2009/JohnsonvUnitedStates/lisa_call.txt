ms.
lisa
call
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
johnson's
conviction
for
battery
in
the
state
of
florida
can
be
sustained
by
the
slightest
contact.
such
a
conviction
does
not
qualify
as
a
violent
felony
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
a
violent
felony
means
one
that
has
as
an
element
the
use,
attempted
use,
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force
against
the
person
of
another.
physical
contact
is
not
the
same
as
physical
force.
physical
force
in
this
context
means
something
more
than
a
mere
quantum
of
physical
contact,
and
it
requires
violent
aggression
that
is
likely
to
cause
physical
injury.
this
conclusion
is
guided
by
the
rules
of
statutory
construction
in
this
court's
precedents.
the
better-reasoned
circuits
have
applied
these
principles
to
find
that
physical
force
means
something
more
than
de
minimis
contact.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
state
statute
required
that
the
offender
admit
the
use
of
force
as
part
of
the
elements
of
his
prior
offense--
ms.
lisa
call
--then
--
no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
then
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
found
that
it
qualified
under
its
own
recidivist
statute
would
not
bind
the
federal
court.
why
we
say
that
hearns
is
binding
is
the
proposition
that
it
found
the
elements
of
a
battery
offense
and
the
--
the
acc
looks
to
those
elements
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
violent
felony.
congress
didn't
say
that
it
--
the
offender
had
to
have
conduct
that
involved
the
use
of
physical
force,
but
a
prior
that
had
as
an
element
the
use.
so
the
fact
that
the
state
statute
may
qualify
under
its
state
recidivism
wouldn't
be
the
same
determination
that
it
didn't
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
force.
here--
ms.
lisa
call
--your
honor,
two
reasons.
first,
the
face
of
the
statute
itself
has
"or",
so
it
doesn't
require--
ms.
lisa
call
--yes.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
because
hearns,
the
florida
state
supreme
court
decision,
described
them
as
three
separate
offenses
and
spelled
out
that
this
statute
could
be
violated
and
it
said
by:
first,
touching
someone
intentionally
and
against
their
will;
second,
by
striking;
or
third,
by
causing
bodily
harm.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
you
would
apply
first
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
"to
touch"
means
the
slightest
contact,
as
the
courts
have
held.
at
pages
41
to
42
we
spelled
out
the
offenses
of
spitting,
making
slight
contact,
that
justified
a
battery
conviction.
"strike"
obviously
has
to
mean
something
else
or
the
legislature
wouldn't
have
included
both
types
of
conduct
within
the
battery
provision.
ms.
lisa
call
for
a
first
offense,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
the
problem
with
saying
that
just
because
it's
a
felony,
therefore
it
can't
be
considered
is
that
the
statute
first
describes
the
prohibited
conduct
and
says
that
the
conduct
is
in
the
first
subparagraph,
the
penalty
is
in
the
second.
so
the
very
same
conduct
is
necessary
for
either
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor,
and
essentially
no
force
times
two
is
still
zero.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
it
is
a
qualitative
line
that
sentencing
judges
would
have
to
make,
like
all
of
the
other
difficult
decisions
that
they're
called
on
to
make
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
these
3553
factors.
we've
asserted
as
a
proposed
test
that
it
be
conduct
just
like
the
begay
test,
that
it
would
be
physical
force
of
a
kind
that
is
violent
and
aggressive
and
likely
to
cause
injury.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
the
government
has
cited
a
footnote
of
6,000
convictions,
and
there
is
no
way
to
know
of
those
convictions
whether
they
were
charged
as
to
touch,
to
strike,
or
to
cause
bodily
harm.
ms.
lisa
call
no,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor,
as
to
looking
to
both
the
enumerated
offenses
and
those
that
fall
in
the
otherwise.
the
first
prong
of
the
acc,
though,
does
not
talk
about
conduct
and
it
does
not
refer
to
an
ordinary
case.
it
says
an
offense
that
has
as
an
element.
and
therefore
it
is
directed
to
looking
at
a
particular
florida
state
statute
rather
than
a
generic
battery
or
how
battery
might
ordinarily--
ms.
lisa
call
--your
honor,
the
reason
why
is
that
congress
was
directing
in
the
first
prong
those
crimes
that
were
directed
against
persons
and
would
be
defined
by
their
elements.
in
the
second
prong
congress
did
list
out
four
enumerated
offenses
that
they
thought
were
committed,
a,
by
career
criminals,
and,
b,
that
created
that
substantial
risk.
in
the
first
part
it
does
not
talk
about
risk
to
others.
it's
that
offender's
conduct
and
an
elements-based
test.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
because--
ms.
lisa
call
--yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that
does
not
qualify
under
the
first
prong.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
it
does
because
it
talks
about
in
florida
the
element
is
the
slightest
contact.
and
we
were
not
arguing
that
that
offender
who
spits
or
touches
or
does
these
other
disrespectful
acts
doesn't
deserve
to
be
charged
and
can't
be
charged
with
battery
under
florida's
state
law.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
again,
it
depends
on
each
particular
statute
and
its
elements.
ms.
lisa
call
well,
your
honor--
ms.
lisa
call
--correct.
ms.
lisa
call
yes.
ms.
lisa
call
two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is,
looking
at
the
underlying
facts
would
violate
the
categorical
approach
of
saying
we're
not
looking
at
what
each
offender
might
have
done
in
any
particular
case,
but
what
are
the
elements
that
he
necessarily
admitted.
and
under
the
florida
statute
it
would
qualify
as
a
violent
felony
because
the
florida
statute
defines
it
as
an
offer
to
do
violence
coupled
with
the--
ms.
lisa
call
--your
honor,
yes,
if
it
has
as
an
element
the
use
of
force.
and
that--
ms.
lisa
call
--yes,
but
under
the
acca,
which
is
one
of
the
phrases
that
the
government
elides
out
of
its
analysis,
it's
not
simply
the
actual
use
of
force,
but
an
attempted
or
threatened
use
of
force.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
some
of
these
questions
will
be
difficult
lines
for
the
court
--
a
sentencing
court
to
draw.
we
have
offered
the
definition
that
violent
felony,
the
word
"violence"
encompasses
sort
of
a
rough
use
of
force
that
could
lead
to
injury
or
is
likely
to
lead
to
injury,
not--
ms.
lisa
call
--your
honor,
the
court
wouldn't
have
to,
and
part
of
where
we
drew
this
from
is
the
court's
language
in
begay
that
indicated
that
crimes
within
clause
(1)
of
acca
are
those
crimes
which
are
also
likely
to
present
a
serious
risk
of
potential
injury
to
others.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
the
qualitative
line
falls
somewhere
higher
than
mere
contact,
which
would
simply
be
the
standard
for
florida
battery
conviction.
ms.
lisa
call
no,
your
honor.
knowing
the
added
fact
of
the
actual
conduct
would
not
answer
the
question
because
it
is
based
on
the
elements.
however,
if
the
prosecutor
charged
it
as
to
strike,
or
there
was
a
division
--
for
example,
at
page
19
of
our
reply
brief
we
showed
the
fifth
circuit
case
in
robledo.
it
tracked
the
exact
same
florida
statute
that
is
at
issue
here
and
said
the
offender
did
touch
or
strike
the
victim,
comma,
by
striking
him
with
a
vehicle.
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
under
the
modified
categorical
approach
to
look
at
the
charging
document
and
the
offender's
necessary
admission
shows
that
was,
in
fact,
a
crime
of
violence.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
two
other
felony
battery
statutes,
apart
from
this
one
that
do--
ms.
lisa
call
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
there
are.
two
other
separate--
ms.
lisa
call
--your
honor,
they
add
the
mens
rea
of
whether
or
not
the
battery
was
intended
to
cause
great
bodily
harm,
permanent
disfigurement,
or
permanent
disability;
and
the
other
says
simply
that
you
committed
a
battery
and
did
cause
--
the
higher
standards.
but
--
and,
in
addition,
the
misdemeanor
battery
includes
the
element
of
causing
bodily
harm,
and
offenders
can
be
charged
simply
with
that
provision.
ms.
lisa
call
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the
felony
version
is
to
cause
great
--
great
bodily
harm.
ms.
lisa
call
and
the
misdemeanor
is
to
cause
bodily
harm,
which
florida
law
defines
as
low
as
causing
a
bruise
or
mark
like
that.
so,
if
someone
were
charged
with,
in
state
court,
a
predicate
that
involved
that
kind
of
injury,
a
prosecutor
using
his
or
her
discretion
could
charge
under
causing
bodily
harm
and
--
which
showed
facts
that
could
support
the
finding
of
a
violent
felony.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
government
exaggerates
the
concerns
of
that
because
there
are
statute
that
both
require
an
admission
of
the
use
of
force
or
have
that
as
an
alternative
that
could
be
prosecuted
in
the
appropriate
case.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
however,
because
the
--
in
hayes,
the
court
was
looking
at
the
"committed
by"
and
whether
that
was
the
--
the
necessary
part
of
the
prior
conviction.
here,
given
the
fact
that
the
statute
can
be
charged
both
in
florida
and
many
other
statutes
to
be
included,
shows
that
those
cases
would
--
it
would
only
be
a
small
number
of
cases
that
are
likely
to
be
affected
where--
ms.
lisa
call
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
according
to
lafave,
only
florida
and
i
believe
one
other
state
has
such
a
broad
definition--
ms.
lisa
call
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
lisa
call
no,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor,
according
to
lafave,
all
states
have
aggravated
battery
statutes
that
include
either
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
or--
ms.
lisa
call
--your
honor,
in
the
legislative
history,
the
only
time
that
they
talked
about
battery
--
in
one
house
report
it
references
battery
and
assault,
simply
by
those
descriptions.
every
other
time,
they
talked
about
assault
and
battery
with
a
deadly
weapon
and
something
more
than
a
simple
touching.
ms.
lisa
call
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
enumerated
offenses
in
the
first
prong.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
when
they--
ms.
lisa
call
--well,
your
honor,
they
did
use
the
word
"element",
and
an
element
is
a
constituent--
ms.
lisa
call
--your
honor,
i
would
have
two
responses
to
that.
the
first
is,
in
the
second
prong,
congress
used
the
word
"conduct".
and
if
they
had
meant
conduct
to
be
included
in
1
rather
than
the
elemental
definition,
that
would
have
been
a
very
easy
definition.
second,
when
they
talked
about
the
crimes
intended
for
category
1,
they
gave
the
examples
of
someone
with
murder
convictions,
rape
convictions,
a
gangland
enforcer.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
your
honor,
it
depends
on
the
element
of
the
offense.
ms.
lisa
call
and,
certainly,
if
the
government
believes--
ms.
lisa
call
--yes,
your
honor.
i
certainly
agree
that--
ms.
lisa
call
--yes,
your
honor,
and--
ms.
lisa
call
--well
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
legislative
history
certainly
indicates
that
1
and
2
had
different
purposes,
but
this
court
didn't
find
begay
and
chambers
on
the
easy
test,
to
say
simply
that
dui
is
not
a
property
crime,
therefore
it
doesn't
qualify.
so
i
hesitate
to
offer
that
as
a
solution
to
the
court,
but
keeping
in
mind
that
the
government--
ms.
lisa
call
--it
is
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
and--
ms.
lisa
call
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
but
if
the
government
failed
to
prove
that
a
predicate
qualified
under
the
first
prong,
it
could
offer
argument
in
evidence
to
the
sentencing
judge
to
show
that
it
met
the
begay
test
and
was,
in
fact
a
serious
risk
of
injury,
that
--
purposeful
violence,
et
cetera.
it's
simply
not
that
battery
by
touching
qualifies.
and,
your
honor,
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder.
ms.
lisa
call
there
are
other
states,
your
honor,
that
have
the
common
law
definition,
but
they
also
have
alternative
versions.
many
of
the
states
also
have
alternative
versions
that
require
either
the
use
of
force
or
the
aggravated
if
the
underlying
conduct
or
the
underlying
charge
was
that
serious
matter
of
involving
physical
force
to
qualify
under
a
violent
felony.
ms.
lisa
call
well,
many
have
alternative
versions
that
require
admission
of
use
of
force,
not
simply,
say,
touching
or
striking
like
florida.
but
all
do
have
felony
versions
of
aggravated
felony.
ms.
lisa
call
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
call
justice
kennedy,
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
that
because
it
was
fully
briefed,
fully
argued--
ms.
lisa
call
--and
i
take
the
--
the
provision
that
when
they
indicated
that
the
test
was
exclusively
under
the
first
prong.
second,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
simply
be
a
waste
of
judicial
resources
if
the
court
finds
that
this
battery
by
touching
doesn't
have,
as
an
element,
the
use
of
force,
the
test
would
be
to
remand
it
to
decide
whether
it
meets
the
begay
standard,
which
is
purposeful,
violent,
aggressive,
and
all
of
those
tests.
ms.
lisa
call
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
other
note
i
would
make
is,
factually,
at
page
40
of
the
joint
appendix,
they
indicated
there
were
no
other
shepard
documents
to
offer
to
the
court,
so
the
entire
record
is
available
for
reconsideration
and
is
available
to
this
court.
ms.
lisa
call
and,
your
honor,
i
wanted
to
note
this
is
not
just
an
academic
exercise
on
noticing
what
physical
force
means.
absent
this
one
finding
of
mr.
johnson's
prior
conviction
was
a
violent
felony,
it
raised
his
guideline
range,
from
27
to
33
months,
to
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
15
years.
so
the
danger
of
including
this
crime,
when
the
art
or
criminal
act
was
not
designed
to
include
all
crimes
or
all
offenders,
means
that
it
took
all
discretion
away
from
the
sentencing
judge.
in
acca,
congress
set
a
superior
high
standard
requiring
three
priors
on
three
--
that
occurred
on
three
separate
occasions,
and
so
looking
at
this
decision,
when
mr.
johnson
was
put
inside
the
box,
that
tied
the
judge's
hands.
if
this
were
not
considered
a
violent
felony,
the
sentencing
judge
could
consider
that
under
the
guidelines
in
the
3553
factors.
but
to
read
physical
force
so
broadly
is
to,
in
essence,
collapse
the
distinction
between
those
violent
offenses
that
are
meant
to
be
included
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act
and
those
that
are
not.
your
honors,
i
would
also
note
one
matter,
that
physical
contact
is
used
in
the
assault
statutes
under
the
federal
code,
so
there
is
a
different
provision
--
a
different
meaning
to
physical
contact
than
to
physical
force,
and
the
physical
force,
in
this
definition,
is
looking
at
what
level
and
what
sort
of
force
congress
intended
to
require
to
impose
this
very
high
sentencing
standard.
and
this
court
had
rejected,
in
shepard,
the
government's
same
happenstance
argument
that
prosecutions
would
depend
on
recordkeeping
and
charging
decisions,
