how
about
pick
pocketing,
would
pick
pocketing
be
a
violent
crime
if
it
involves
a
touching
necessarily?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
a
very
good
pick
pocket
could
get
--
could
get
just
the
wallet
and
not
touch
the
person,
i'm
not
sure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
really
a
question
for
petitioner's
counsel,
and
i
didn't
have
time
to
ask
as
your
white
light
goes
on.
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
you
do
not
prevail
on
your
argument,
that
this
is
under
roman
--
small
roman
1,
that
if
--
you
have
to
remand
for
small
roman
2?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
an
argument
that
you
anticipate
objecting
to
that
remand?
or
is
this
absolutely
clear-cut
that
we
must
remand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
don't
want
to
waste
too
much
of
your
time
on
the
remand,
but
i
can't
really
fault
the
government
for
waiving
a
right
to
raise
a
claim
under
clause
2,
which
is
your
second
reason
for
not
--
not
remanding,
and
it
--
it
does
seem,
to,
me
that
the
eleventh
circuit
--
one
permissible
reading
was
that
they
were
just
looking
at
1,
so
that
we
would
have
to
remand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
except
in
this
area,
i
am
a
little
reluctant
when
it
hasn't
been
argued
before
as
to
make
a
definitive
holding,
but
i
will
look
at
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
again.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
