justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gura,
do
you
think
it's
at
all
easier
to
bring
the
second
amendment
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
than
it
is
to
bring
it
under
our
established
law
of
substantive
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
easier
to
do
it
under
privileges
and
immunities
than
it
is
under
substantive
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
--
whether
the
slaughter-house
cases
were
right
or
wrong.
i'm
saying,
assuming
we
give,
you
know,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
your
definition,
does
that
make
it
any
easier
to
get
the
second
amendment
adopted
with
respect
to
the
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
why
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
150,
140
years
of
prior
law,
when
--
when
you
can
reach
your
result
under
substantive
due
--
i
mean,
you
know,
unless
you're
bucking
for
a
--
a
place
on
some
law
school
faculty--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
what
you
argue
is
the
darling
of
the
professoriate,
for
sure,
but
it's
also
contrary
to
140
years
of
our
jurisprudence.
why
do
you
want
to
undertake
that
burden
instead
of
just
arguing
substantive
due
process?
which,
as
much
as
i
think
it's
wrong,
i
have
--
even
i
have
acquiesced
in
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
rights
rooted
in
the
traditions
and
conscience
of
our
people?
would
--
would
that
do
the
job?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
happens
to
be
the
test
we
have
used
under
substantive
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
lot
of
statistical
disagreement
on
whether
the
miranda
rule
saves
lives
or
not,
whether
it
results
in
the
release
of
dangerous
people
who
have
confessed
to
their
crime,
but
the
confession
can't
be
used.
we
don't
--
we
don't
resolve
questions
like
that
on
the
basis
of
statistics,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
would
this
one
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
statistics?
if
there's
a
constitutional
right,
we
find
what
the
minimum
constitutional
right
is,
and
everything
above
that
is
up
to
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
want
to
have,
you
know
--
i
think
we
mentioned
in
heller
concealed
carry
laws.
i
mean,
those
are
--
those
are
matters
that
we
didn't
decide
in
heller.
and
you
may
have
a
great
deal
of
divergence
from
state
to
state.
and
on
that,
i
suppose,
you
would
do
statistics,
wouldn't
you?
or
the
legislature
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
judges.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
would
be
for
the
legislatures.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we
--
i
guess
we
have
applied
substantive
due
process
with
regard
to
the
necessity
of
permitting
homosexual
conduct
and
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
permitting
abortion
on
demand.
we
have
not
adopted
a
more
rigid
rule
for
the
federal
government
than
we
have
adopted
for
the
states
in
either
of
those
instances,
have
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
is
the
last
time
an
opinion
of
ours
made
that
the
test,
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty?
it
sounds
very
nice.
but
when
is
the
last
time
we
used
it?
i
think
it
was
1937.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
it
been
the
basis
of
our
decision
in
any
case
since
palko?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
are
a
lot
of
countries
that
don't
give
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
even
england
does
not
give
it
in
all
criminal
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
may
be
the
reason
it
was
put
there.
but
it
was
put
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
crucial
fact.
it
is
either
there
or
it
is
not
there.
and
if
it's
there,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
difference
why
they
chose
to
put
that
one
there
as
opposed
to
other
ones
that
they
didn't
put
there.
it's
either
there
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
basis
would
there
be
to
--
to
deny
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
firearms
kill
people
is
what
the
states
say,
and
--
and
we
ban
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
other
countries
have
done
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
did
do
it,
i
think
you'd
have
to
say
it's
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
the
reason
is
guns
are
dangerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said
that
is
the
reason
it
was
codified.
they
did
not
say
that
that
is
the
function
of
what
was
codified.
the
function
of
what
was
codified
was
to
enforce
the
traditional
right
of
the
people
to
bear
arms.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
say
that
that
wasn't
the
reason
it
was
codified
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
it
consists
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
let
me
take
your
argument
at
--
at
its
face
value.
let's
assume
that
the
only
reason
it
is
there
and
the
only
purpose
it
serves
is
the
militia
purpose.
isn't
that
militia
purpose
just
as
much
defeated
by
allowing
the
states
to
take
away
the
militia's
arms
as
it
would
be
by
allowing
the
federal
government
to
take
away
the
militia's
arms?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
if
you
assume
that
the
whole
thing
turns
around
the
militia
prologue,
that
prologue
is
just
as
--
just
as
important
with
respect
to
the
state's
depriving
the
people
of
arms.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
switching
horses
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
just
focus
on
your
argument
that
--
that
--
that
deals
with
the
prologue.
you
say
this
is
different
because
of
that
prologue.
but
that
prologue
has
just
as
much
force
if
the
states
take
away
the
militia's
arms
as
if
the
federal
government
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
eleven
of
the
colonies
had
a
guarantee
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
and
i
believe
something
like
44
states
currently
have
in
their
constitutions
protection
of
the
right
to
bear
arms.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
suggest
anything
about
--
about
how
fundamental
it
is
generally?
justice
antonin
scalia
"subject
to
such
regulation"
certainly
excludes
banning
them
entirely,
which
is
what
you
assert
can
be
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
purpose
of
a
state
constitutional
guarantee
which
has
at
the
end
of
it
"subject
to
such
regulation
as
the
legislature
may
proscribe.
"
if
that
regulation
includes
banning
it
entirely?
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
make
a
nullity
of
the
constitutional
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
what
you're
asserting
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
states
have
to
allow
firearms?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
didn't
think
so,
either,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
does
your
last
argument
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
said
as
much
in
heller.
justice
antonin
scalia
handguns
in
the
home?
justice
antonin
scalia
handguns
in
the
home?
that's
what
heller
addressed.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
can't,
because
they
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
see,
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
right
there.
it's
right
there
in
the
bill
of
rights.
where
do
you
find
the
right
to
self-defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
want
us
to
impose
that
one
on
the
states
but
not
--
not
the
explicit
guarantee
of
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
that
seems
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
district
of
columbia
did.
that's
what
heller
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
urging
is
really
a
mixed
blessing
for
gun
control
advocates.
to
the
extent
we
sever
the
federal
guarantee
from
what
the
states
are
obliged
to
comport
with,
we
encourage
a
stricter
federal
second
amendment,
one
that
forbids
all
sorts
of
regulations
that
the
federal
government
might
otherwise
be
allowed
to
do,
because
it
doesn't
matter
--
the
states
can
take
care
of
it.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
--
if
you
sever
the
two,
you're
encouraging
a
broader
prohibition
at
the
federal
level,
and
that's
what
--
heller
was
very
careful
not
to
impose
such
a
broad
prohibition
precisely
because
it
realized
that
--
that
this
is
a
national
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
trouble
you.
