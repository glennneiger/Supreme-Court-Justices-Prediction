justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
how
does
that
work?
i
think
that
would
be
useful
for
either
you
or
mr.
clement,
if
you've
thought
this
through.
is
this
right
different
from
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
two
ways.
one
is
that
--
look
at
--
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
briefs.
look
at
the
statistics.
you
know,
one
side
says
a
million
people
killed
by
guns.
chicago
says
that
their
--
their
gun
law
has
saved
hundreds,
including
--
and
they
have
statistics
--
including
lots
of
women
in
domestic
cases.
and
the
other
side
disputes
it.
this
is
a
highly
statistical
matter.
without
incorporation,
it's
decided
by
state
legislatures;
with,
it's
decided
by
federal
judges.
now,
think
of
this,
too:
that
when
you
have
the
first
amendment,
or
some
of
the
other
amendments,
there's
always
a
big
area
where
it's
free
speech
versus
a
whole
lot
of
things,
but
not
often
free
speech
versus
life.
when
it's
free
speech
versus
life,
we
very
often
decide
in
favor
of
life.
here
every
case
will
be
on
one
side
guns,
on
the
other
side
human
life.
statistics,
balancing
life
versus
guns.
how
are
federal
judges
in
your
opinion,
rather
than
legislatures
in
the
states
in
a
federal
system
--
how
are
federal
judges
supposed
to
carry
this
out?
i
want
to
see
where
we're
going.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
heller,
i
didn't
think,
explained
that
with
great
--
i
was
dissenting,
though.
i
didn't
think
it
explained
it
with
total
clarity,
but
that's
a
dissenter's
view.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
be
specific,
suppose
chicago
says,
look,
by
banning
handguns
not
in
the
hills,
not
hunting,
nothing
like
that,
nothing
outside
the
city
--
in
the
city,
we
save
several
hundred
human
lives
every
year.
and
the
other
side
says,
we
don't
think
it
is
several
hundred,
and,
moreover,
that
doesn't
matter.
how
do
you
decide
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
they
can
have
--
no
matter
what,
that
the
city
just
can't
have
guns
even
if
they're
saving
hundreds
of
lives
--
they
can't
ban
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
difference
here
with
the
other
amendments.
there
is
a
difference,
and
the
other
amendments
--
you
have
the
first
amendment's,
the
first
amendment
expression.
here
we
have
right
in
the
amendment
written
a
militia-related
clause.
and
the
way
that
--
the
way
--
the
way
that
the
right
might
be
incorporated
in
respect
to
that
is
light
years
different
from
the
way
it
might
be
interpreted
if
you
think
what
it
is,
is
the
right
to
have
a
gun
to
shoot
a
burglar.
they're
just
two
separate
things.
and
as
to
the
first,
it's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
see
why
you'd
incorporate
it,
for
reasons
i
won't
go
into.
as
to
the
second,
i
understand
it.
so
we're
starting
with
a
difference
in
purposes
at
the
least.
and
shouldn't
that
make
a
difference
in
how
you
incorporate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
the
--
one
of
the
reasons--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
least,
is
that
--
you've
read,
i'm
sure,
that
all
the
law
professors
at
harvard,
yale,
princeton,
london,
et
cetera,
that
say
even
blackstone
in
the
17th
century
thought
that
this
is
primarily
a
right
to
raise
an
army
through
parliament
to
--
well,
i
can't
go
on
here.
i'm
just
saying
think
of
that
brief,
and
you'll
see
the
differences,
even
accepting
heller.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
do
we
read
the
--
the
clause
at
the
beginning
--
the
militia
clause
--
we're
supposed
to
read
the
words
of
the
constitution,
aren't
we?
i
guess--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
answer
to
that's
yes.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
very
well,
and
doesn't
that
suggest
what
the
purpose
of
putting
the
right
there
is
even
under
heller
or
at
least
one
purpose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
does
that
not
give
us
a
clue
as
to
what
they
thought
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
ordered
liberty
was?
that's
your
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
suppose
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
it
is.
assume
for
argument's
sake
that
it
is.
still,
i
take
from
what
you
are
saying
that
--
let's
make
up
an
imaginary
importance
of
ordered
liberty
chart,
and
we
give
it
to
james
madison
and
the
other
framers.
and
he
would
say,
insofar
as
that
right
to
bear
arms
is
important
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
militia,
it's
high
on
the
ordered
liberty
chart.
insofar
as
the
right
to
bear
arms
is
there
to
shoot
burglars,
it's
low
on
the
ordered
liberty
chart.
and
if
that's
what
they'd
say,
it's
conceivable
that
part
of
this
amendment
would
go
through
and
be
incorporated;
namely,
that
part
which
would
prevent
a
law
that
would
disarm
people
to
the
extent
they
couldn't
form
militias.
but
that
part
which
would
disarm
people
to
the
extent
that
they
couldn't
shoot
burglars,
that
would
not
be
incorporated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
step
one
--
step
one
is
make
my
chart.
step
two
is
look
at
what's
high.
step
three
is,
even
though
that
high
part,
even
that
high
part,
nobody
could
think
was
incorporated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
did,
actually.
he
did.
that's
how
he
went
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
alito
said
justice
stevens
has
written
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
that
discusses
why
the
fourteenth
amendment's
guarantee
of
the
substantive
due
process
does
not
include
a
right
to
possess
a
firearm
in
the
home
for
the
purpose
of
private
self-defense
and
i
agree
with
the
conclusion
of
that
opinion,
but
in
addition
i
have
a
written
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
sotomayor
joined
and
that
separate
opinion
directly
address
the
incorporation
question
that
you’ve
just
heard
about
and
particularly
the
majority's
conclusion
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporates
and
applies
against
the
states
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
for
the
purpose
of
private
self-defense.
the
opinion
explains
why
we
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
now
the
opinion
has
three
parts,
not
short.
[laughter]
in
the
first
part,
it
returns
to
heller.
the
court
then
there
concluded
and
i
quote,
"that
individual
self-defense
was
the
central
component
of
the
second
amendment's
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms."
four
justices,
i
was
one,
disagreed
with
that
conclusion.
since
heller
was
decided,
numerous
historians
and
scholars
have
expressed
the
view
that
the
court
got
its
history
wrong
and
i
like
to
think
by
implication
that
the
dissenters
got
it
right.
so
given
the
shakiness
of
the
historical
foundations,
why
should
the
court
now
go
on
to
extend
in
a
very
broad
way
heller's
applicability.
but,
heller
has
been
decided
and
majority
of
the
court
does
not
wish
to
revisit
that
case,
so
we
go
on
to
the
second
part
of
the
opinion
which
accepts
heller
as
a
given
and
explains
why
even
on
that
assumption,
the
majority's
incorporation
conclusion
is
wrong.
well,
why
is
it
wrong?
why
is
this
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
for
purposes
of
personal
self-defense?
why
is
it
not
fundamental
enough
to
warrant
incorporation
and
application
to
the
states?
first,
as
the
court
conceded
in
heller
and
here
i
quote
heller
again,
"the
threat
that
the
new
federal
government
would
destroy
the
citizen's
militia,”
that’s
the
militia
part
of
this,
“by
taking
away
their
arms
was
the
reason.
that
right
was
codified
in
a
written
constitution."
thus
the
protection
of
the
different
part
of
it,
the
right
to
private
self-defense
was
from
a
framer's
perspective
at
best
a
secondary
motive.
second,
there
is
no
consensus
in
america
that
the
right
to
private
armed
self-defense
is
fundamental.
rather
there
are
opposing
points
of
view,
each
held
by
many
americans.
some
believe
that
the
right
is
necessary
to
protect
their
lives,
of
those
attacked
in
their
homes.
others
believe
that
regulation
of
the
right
is
necessary
in
order
to
save
the
lives
of
those
attacked
with
guns.
and
therefore
the
appropriate
level
of
gun
regulation
has
long
been
and
continues
to
be
a
hotly
contested
matter
of
political
debate.
third,
unlike
other
rights,
and
i
think
every
other
right
that
the
court
has
found
to
be
incorporated,
incorporating
the
private
self-defense
right
will
not
further
some
important,
broader,
additional
constitutional
objective.
unlike
the
first
amendment's
rights
of
free
speech,
free
press,
assembly
and
petition,
the
private
self-defense
right
is
not
part,
an
essential
part
of
a
democratic
process.
unlike
those
others,
no
one
claims
this
is.
unlike
the
first
amendment's
religious
protections,
the
fourth
amendment's
protection
of
criminal
suspects,
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment's
insistence
upon
fair
criminal
procedure
or
the
eighth
amendment's
protection
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
the
private
self-defense
right
does
not
significantly
protect
individuals,
i
might
say
quite
often
unpopular
individuals,
who
would
otherwise
suffer
very
unfair
or
inhumane
treatment
at
the
hands
of
a
majority.
unlike
the
fifth
amendment's
insistence
on
just
compensation
for
government
takings,
it
does
not
protect
the
property
rights
of
what
is
likely
a
minority
of
individuals
from
the
unfair
acts
of
a
majority.
unlike
the
protections
offered
by
almost
all
of
these
same
amendments,
the
right
at
issue
here
does
not
involve
as
to
which
judge,
a
matter,
as
to
which
judge
is,
when
you
compare
them
to
legislatures,
seem
to
have
the
greater
expertise
of
application.
we
have
no
reason
here
to
think
that
the
political
process
is
not
perfectly
capable
of
safeguarding
the
interests
that
the
second
amendment
protects.
fourth,
to
the
contrary
of
what
i
have
just
said,
we
do
have
strong
reason
to
believe
that
incorporation
of
this
private
right
of
self-defense
will
significantly
interfere
with
other
basic
constitutional
objectives,
particularly
those
related
to
the
constitution's
assignment
of
different
tasks
to
different
institutions,
to
legislatures
and
to
courts,
to
states
and
to
the
federal
government.
for
one
thing,
consider
the
effect
of
incorporation
on
the
relationship
between
courts
and
legislatures.
every
state
and
many
local
communities
have
highly
detailed
and
complicated
regulatory
schemes
governing
nearly
every
aspect
of
firearm
ownership.
who
can
sell
guns,
how?
who
can
purchase
guns,
how?
where
they
can
be
possessed,
what
kinds
and
so
forth.
each
of
these
regulations
is
now
a
potential
subject
of
a
federal
constitutional
challenge
and
how
our
federal
judges
suppose
to
decide
all
this
issues.
certainly,
the
stakes
are
high.
in
nearly
every
case,
the
government
is
going
to
argue
that
those
regulations
are
necessary
to
help
prevent
death
and
injury.
we
are
told
that
firearms
cause
well
over
60,000
deaths
and
injuries
in
the
united
states
each
year.
an
amicus
brief
in
the
chicago
case
says
that
that
handgun
ban
there
may
have
saved
close
to
a
thousand
lives
since
its
enactment,
but
just
as
they
have
here,
challengers
to
regulations
are
going
to
argue
to
the
contrary.
well,
who
is
right
and
how
are
judges
supposed
to
answer
these
questions?
legal
reasoning
is
not
just
going
to
somehow
mechanically
find
the
answer
and
you
can
quote
as
much
as
you
like
blackstone's
saying
that,
a
man's
home
is
his
castle
or
whatever,
but
that
will
not
give
you
the
answer
and
courts
can't
simply
ignore
the
fact
that
these
answers
to
these
kinds
of
questions
will
rest
on
matters
of
empirical
fact.
how
can
they
decide
how
important
the
state's
regulatory
interest
is
without
addressing
the
consequences
of
the
gun
regulation
in
question?
how
can
they
decide
if
there
is
some
less
restrictive
way
to
further
than
interest
unless
they
try
to
figure
out
what's
actually
going
to
happen
if
those
other
ways
are
implemented.
the
point
is
that
empirical
matters
are
bound
in
all
these
questions
and
judges
just
do
not
know
answers
to
the
sorts
of
questions
that
they
will
have
to
evaluate
in
order
to
decide
the
need
for
particular
kinds
of
gun
regulation,
say
the
extent
to
which
a
ban
on
loaded
handguns
will
help
save
the
lives
of
homeowners
or
of
children.
nor
do
we
judges
have
readily
available
tools
for
finding
the
answers.
i’m
not
saying
they
can
never
do
it.
i’m
just
saying
it's
not
their
natural
forte.
but
at
the
same
time,
legislatures
do
have
the
ability
to
do
just
this
kind
of
thing;
to
uncover
facts,
to
evaluate
the
facts,
to
work
out
how
those
evaluations
of
facts
are
to
given
legislative
meaning,
given
the
desires
of
people
in
their
community,
they
understand
facts,
they
have
the
tools,
they
understand
the
relevance,
and
legislatures,
unlike
article
iii
judges,
can
be
held
democratically
responsible
for
their
empirically
based
and
(inaudible)
conclusions,
that’s
their
job.
for
another
thing,
consider
the
effect
of
incorporation
on
the
constitutional
relationship
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
since
the
framing,
the
states
have
had
plenary
authority
to
regulate
private
use
of
firearms.
indeed,
such
regulation
is
the
quintessential
exercise
of
the
police
power
which
traditionally
has
included
the
power
to
protect
the
lives
and
whims
of
all
persons
within
the
state.
the
court
today
substitutes
federal
regulation
for
state
regulation
in
this
area.
that
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
states
to
legislate
in
ways
that
reflect
local
preferences
and
conditions
in
an
area
where
it
is
particularly
important
that
they
have
the
freedom
to
do
so.
the
incidents
of
gun
ownership
and
gun
violence
very
substantially,
as
between
crowded
cities
and
rural
communities
and
among
different
regions
of
the
country,
different
states
and
their
local
communities
have
historically
differed
about
the
need
for
gun
regulation
as
well
as
about
its
proper
level.
federalism,
traditionally,
means
that
a,
"single
courageous
state
can
serve
as
a
laboratory
of
democracy
in
search
of
the
right
level
of
regulations,
the
level
that
best
balances
its
individual
need
to
prevent
gun
violence
with
its
citizens
desires
to
encourage
self-defense."
democracy
means
that
the
people
can
continue
to
decide
these
matters
by
vote.
by
way
of
contrast,
incorporation
means
that
a
single
national
standard
will
be
imposed
on
the
people
of
every
state
by
unelected
federal
judges.
in
some,
the
police
power,
the
need
for
local
decision
making,
the
superiority
of
legislative
decision
making,
the
lack
of
manageable
judicial
standards,
the
comparative
desirability
of
democratic
decision
making
and
the
life
threatening
harm
that
may
flow
from
setting
regulations
aside
all
argue
here
against
incorporation.
where
the
incorporation
of
other
rights
has
been
at
issue,
and
justice
alito's
completely
right
about
this,
some
of
these
problems
have
arisen.
but
in
this
instance,
all
of
these
problems
are
present,
all
at
the
same
time
and
all
likely
present
in
most,
perhaps
nearly
all
of
the
cases
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
a
gun
regulation
is
at
issue.
and
at
the
same
time
the
general
factors
present
in
other
cases
that
had
favored
incorporation
here
are
absent.
the
court
does
not
examine
at
great
length
the
factors
i
have
mentioned,
but
rather
it
rests
review,
primarily
not
exclusively,
upon
its
view
of
history.
the
third
part
of
the
dissent
explains
why
that
history
cannot
justify
incorporation.
in
our
view,
the
civil
war
history
really
shows
something
about
discrimination
and
why
it's
wrong,
not
about
possessing
guns,
these
are
special
rights,
but
that’s
debatable.
but
we
conclude
the
historical
records
shows
that
states
and
localities
have
consistently
enacted
firearms
regulations,
including
regulations
similar
to
those
at
issue
here
throughout
our
nation's
history.
conclusion,
one,
the
framers
did
not
write
the
second
amendment
in
order
to
protect
a
private
right
of
armed
self-defense.
two,
there
is
no
consensus
if
the
right
is
or
was
fundamental.
three,
no
broader
constitutional
interest
or
principle
supports
legal
treatment
of
that
right
as
fundamental.
four,
incorporation
is
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
constitution's
allocation
of
responsibilities
between
states
and
the
federal
government,
between
courts
and
legislatures.
and
five,
nothing
in
18th,
19th,
20th
or
21st
century
history
shows
an
unambiguous
historical
consensus
that
the
right
is
sufficiently
fundamental
as
to
warrant
incorporation.
in
our
view,
heller
or
no
heller,
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
incorporate
a
private
right
of
arm
self-defense
and
apply
that
right
against
the
states.
