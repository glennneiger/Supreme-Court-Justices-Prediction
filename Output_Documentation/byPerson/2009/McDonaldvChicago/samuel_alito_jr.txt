justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
thought
your--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
we
should
go
back--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
mr.
clement,
why
shouldn't
we
go
back
completely
to
justice
harlan's
view
about
the
way
in
which
the
bill
of
rights
applies
to
the
states?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
your
position
is
that
a
--
a
state
or
local
government
could
completely
ban
all
firearms?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
argument.
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
if
a
state
or
local
government
were
to
ban
firearms
completely,
this
court
might
hold
that
that
violates
substantive
due
process
because
the
right
to
use
a
firearm
for
self-defense
is
--
might
be
held
to
be
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty;
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
--
but
i
thought
you
began
by
saying
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
not
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
we
took
the
approach
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
we
took
the
approach
that
justice
breyer
outlined,
would
--
why
would
we
not
do
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
all
the
applications
of
all
of
the
amendments
that
up
to
this
point
have
been
regarded
as
being
completely
incorporated,
along
with
all
of
our
decisions?
so
why
would
we
not
look
at
all
of
our
decisions
under
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment,
and
rank
all
of
those
interpretations
on
some
scale
of
ordered
liberty?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
does
it
include
the
right
to
contract?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
an
unenumerated
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
two
years
ago
in
district
of
columbia
versus
heller,
we
held
that
the
second
amendment
protects
an
individual
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
in
the
home
for
purposes
of
self-defense.
the
heller
case
did
not
involve
a
law
enacted
by
a
state
or
by
any
subdivision
of
a
state,
and
therefore,
heller
did
not
decide
whether
the
second
amendment
applies
to
the
states.
this
case
requires
us
to
address
that
question.
this
litigation
began
when
several
chicago
residents
brought
suit,
challenging
chicago
ordinances
that
effectively
ban
handgun
possession
by
virtually
all
private
persons
in
the
city.
chicago
has
high
rates
of
violent
crime
and
the
chicago
residents
who
brought
suit,
fear
for
their
safety
and
want
to
keep
handguns
in
their
homes
for
self-protection.
the
litigation
against
chicago
and
similar
litigation
against
the
chicago
suburb
of
oak
park
were
dismissed
by
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed,
relying
primarily
on
several
cases
decided
by
this
case
--
this
court
in
the
late
19th
century.
we
granted
certiorari.
in
order
to
explain
the
question,
we
must
decide,
it's
helpful
to
review
very
briefly
some
basic
constitutional
history.
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
originally
applied
only
to
the
federal
government
and
that
is
how
things
stood
until
after
the
civil
war.
after
the
civil
war,
the
ratification
of
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
changed
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
two
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
figure
in
the
present
case.
the
first
is
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
which
prohibits
a
state
from
abridging
"the
privileges
or
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states.”
the
second
is
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
prohibits
a
state
from
depriving
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
at
the
time
of
the
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
were
those
who
thought
that
the
phrase
"privileges
or
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states"
protected
all
of
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
bill
of
rights
and
there
are
prominent
scholars
today
who
continue
to
hold
that
view.
the
meaning
of
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
came
before
the
court
in
the
slaughter-house
cases
in
1873.
in
that
case,
in
a
sharply
divided
decision,
the
court
gave
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
of
their
own
very
narrow
interpretation
and
the
late
19th
century
cases
on
which
the
seventh
circuit
relied
have
generally
been
interpreted
as
holding
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
does
not
qualify
as
one
of
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
national
citizenship.
while
the
slaughter-house
cases
meant
that
the
right
set
out
in
the
bill
of
rights
would
not
be
protected
by
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
against
infringement
by
the
states,
the
court
beginning
around
the
turn
of
the
century
began
to
consider
whether
those
rights
were
protected
against
abridgment
by
the
states
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court's
decisions
on
this
question
fall
into
two
distinct
errors.
the
first
runs
from
around
to
the
end
of
the
19th
century
until
roughly
the
middle
of
the
20th
century.
the
second
one
is
from
the
end
of
the
prior
era
to
the
present
day
and
has
featured
what
has
often
been
called
the
process
of
“selective
incorporation.”
now
let
me
return
to
the
pre-selective
incorporation
era.
the
three
characteristics
of
the
cases
that
were
handed
down
during
that
period
should
be
noted.
first,
some
of
the
court's
cases
during
this
era
said
that
the
due
process
clause
protects
only
those
rights
that
are
indispensable
characteristics
of
any
civilized
society.
second,
the
court
during
that
time
was
not
hesitant
to
hold
that
a
right
set
out
in
the
bill
of
rights
was
not
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
and
third,
even
when
a
right
set
out
in
the
bill
of
rights
was
held
to
fall
within
the
conception
of
due
process,
the
protection
or
the
remedies
that
were
available
against
the
states
often
differed
from
the
protection
or
remedies
that
were
available
against
the
federal
government.
during
this
pre-selective
incorporation
era,
there
was
viable
theory
concerning
the
relationship
between
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
states
and
that
has
often
been
called
the
theory
of
"total
incorporation"
which
as
the
name
suggests
meant
that
the
due
process
clause
would
be
totally
incorporated
--
would
totally
incorporate
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights.
the
court
never
accepted
that
theory,
but
eventually
it
moved
in
that
direction
by
beginning
the
process
of
selective
incorporation.
and
selective
incorporation
meant
that
the
court
incorporated
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
one-by-one
rather
than
all
at
once.
the
court
abandoned
the
three
characteristics
of
the
earlier
era
that
i
have
previously
noted.
first,
the
court
made
it
clear
that
the
governing
standard
is
not
whether
a
right
is
an
essential
feature
of
any
civilized
nation.
instead,
the
court
considered
whether
or
right
it's
fundamental
from
a
distinctly
american
perspective.
second,
the
court
shed
any
reluctance
to
hold
that
rights
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights
met
the
requirements
for
protection
under
the
due
process
clause.
indeed
the
court
eventually
incorporated
virtually
all
of
the
rights
in
the
bill
of
rights
under
the
due
process
clause.
and
third,
the
court
emphatically
rejected
what
it
called,
"the
notion
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
the
states
only
a
watered-down,
subjective
version
of
the
individual
guarantees
of
the
bill
of
rights.”
instead,
the
court
took
the
position
that
incorporated
bill
of
rights
protections
"are
all
to
be
enforced
against
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
according
to
the
same
standards
that
protect
those
personal
rights
against
federal
encroachment."
i
now
turn
directly
to
the
question
before
us
in
this
case,
does
the
second
amendment
right
recognized
in
heller
apply
to
the
states
and
if
so,
does
it
apply
to
the
states
to
the
same
extent
as
it
applies
to
the
federal
government.
the
court
holds
that
it
does.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
setting
out
the
judgment
of
the
court.
justice
thomas
joins
that
opinion
in
part,
but
he
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
explaining
that
he
would
hold
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
one
of
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
national
citizenship.
i
will
now
describe
the
remainder
of
the
opinion
that
i
have
filed
and
that
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy.
we
analyzed
the
question
presented
here
under
the
due
process
clause,
that
is
the
practice
that
the
court
has
followed
now
for
more
than
a
century
and
we
continue
on
that
path
and
we
hold
that
the
heller
right
easily
meets
the
standard
that
the
court
has
used
during
the
last
half
century.
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
implicit
in
our
understanding
of
ordered
liberty
and
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
traditions
of
our
country.
heller
thoroughly
explored
the
origins
of
the
right
and
show
that
it
was
considered
fundamental
by
those
who
drafted
and
ratified
the
bill
of
rights.
this
understanding
continued
during
the
early
years
of
the
republic
when
many
states
adopted
constitutional
provisions,
protecting
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
evidence
from
the
civil
war
period
is
particularly
instructive.
when
the
civil
war
ended,
soldiers
in
the
union
army
were
allowed
to
keep
their
rifles
when
they
returned
home.
more
than
180,000
african-americans
served
in
the
union
army
and
when
they
returned
home
often
to
the
states
of
the
old
confederacy,
systematic
efforts
were
made
to
disarm
them
and
other
blacks.
armed
parties
often
consisting
of
ex-confederate
soldiers
serving
in
the
state
militias
forcibly
took
firearms
from
newly
freed
slaves
and
other
blacks.
the
reconstruction
era
congress
was
alarmed
by
these
practices.
a
document
that
was
published
by
congress
at
that
time
recounted
the
following
story
which
is
representative.
in
one
town
the
marshal
took
all
arms
from
the
returning
black
soldiers
and
then
was
"very
prompt
in
shooting
the
blacks
whenever
an
opportunity
occurred."
union
army
commanders
tried
to
stop
these
abuses
by
issuing
orders,
securing
the
right
of
all
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms,
but
congress
decided
that
more
was
needed.
it
first
turned
to
ordinary
legislation.
it
enacted
the
freedmen’s
bureau
act
of
1866
which
explicitly
guaranteed
the
right
of
all
citizens
"to
have
the
full
and
equal
benefit
of
the
constitutional
right
to
bear
arms."
the
civil
rights
act
1866
had
a
similar
aim,
but
congress
feared
that
these
civil
rights
laws
would
be
held
to
exceed
congress'
power
and
congress
then
proposed
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
was
ratified.
in
the
face
of
this
evidence,
chicago
and
oak
park
contend
that
the
reconstruction
era
congress
did
not
want
to
protect
the
right
of
all
persons
to
keep
and
bear
arms,
but
solely
sought
to
outlaw
discriminatory
laws
and
practices.
this
argument
is
implausible.
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
clear
terms
of
the
freedmen's
bureau
act
of
1866
and
outlawing
the
private
possession
of
firearms
in
the
south
would
have
left
blacks
vulnerable
to
their
worst
abusers,
the
local
peace
officers
and
the
state
militias.
chicago,
oak
park
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
this
case
make
many
other
arguments
against
incorporation
of
the
heller
right.
i
will
comment
on
only
three.
the
first,
--
the
first
set
of
these
arguments
basically
disputes
heller's
interpretation
of
the
original
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
in
light
of
recent
scholarship.
it
is
hard
to
think
of
a
question
of
original
meaning
that
has
now
been
explored
more
thoroughly
than
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
we
reaffirm
heller's
analysis
of
that
issue.
the
second
argument
is
basically
a
plea
that
we
return
to
the
pre-incorporation
era
case
law
at
least
for
this
one
case.
it
is
argued
that
conditions
vary
from
state-to-state
and
from
city-to-city
and
that
each
state
and
city
should
be
free
to
enact
the
firearm
laws
that
are
most
consistent
with
its
interests
and
the
values
of
its
citizens.
it's
also
argued
that
it
is
beneficial
to
allow
states
and
cities
to
experiment
with
a
variety
of
different
approaches.
these
arguments
are
not
new.
they
are
precisely
the
arguments
that
would
--
were
made
by
dissenters,
most
notably
by
justice
harlan
when
the
court
began
the
process
of
“selective
incorporation.”
it
was
argued
that
the
entire
county
should
not
be
bound
by
a
single
rule
regarding
searches
and
seizures,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
double
jeopardy,
the
right
to
counsel
and
so
on,
but
the
court
disagreed.
those
who
proposed
that
we
return
to
the
old
approach
in
this
case
are
presumably
not
asking
that
we
undo
all
the
incorporation
cases
decided
during
the
past
half
century.
what
is
proposed
instead,
it
seems,
is
a
return
to
the
old
rules
for
the
second
amendment
right
only.
we
refuse
to
take
that
approach.
incorporation
must
be
governed
by
neutral
principles.
the
other
argument
that
i
will
comment
on
is
this.
it
is
argued
that
the
second
amendment
right
should
not
be
incorporated
because
it
has
controversial
public
safety
implications.
the
argument
goes
as
follows.
some
people
think
that
the
proliferation
of
handguns
leads
to
increased
crime.
other
people
think
that
allowing
private
citizens
to
own
handguns
and
keep
them
in
their
homes
for
self-defense
will
promote
public
safety.
it
is
argued
that
because
it
is
unclear
which
view
is
correct,
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
should
not
be
made
binding
on
the
states.
this
argument
like
the
one
just
discussed
is
inconsistent
with
our
“selective
incorporation”
cases.
the
second
amendment
right
is
not
the
only
provision
in
the
bill
of
rights
that
has
controversial
public
safety
implications.
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
to
governed
law
enforcement
practices,
the
prosecution
of
cases,
criminal
cases
and
the
punishment
of
offenders
all
have
disputed
public
safety
implications,
but
the
court
has
never
refused
to
incorporate
any
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
on
that
ground.
accordingly
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
the
right
recognized
in
heller
is
fully
applicable
to
the
states.
as
heller
notes
it,
this
right
is
not
unlimited.
heller
held
that
the
particular
ordinances
at
issue
in
that
case
violated
the
second
amendment,
but
the
holding
went
no
further.
the
decision
on
the
second
circuit
--
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
reversed,
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
