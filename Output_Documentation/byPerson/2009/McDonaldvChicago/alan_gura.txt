mr.
alan
gura
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
chicago's
ordinances
cannot
survive
the
faithful
application
of
due
process
doctrines,
there
is
an
even
simpler,
more
essential
reason
for
reversing
the
lower
court's
judgment.
the
constitution's
plain
text,
as
understood
by
the
people
that
ratified
it,
mandates
this
result.
in
1868,
our
nation
made
a
promise
to
the
mcdonald
family;
they
and
their
descendants
would
henceforth
be
american
citizens,
and
with
american
citizenship
came
the
guarantee
enshrined
in
our
constitution
that
no
state
could
make
or
enforce
any
law
which
shall
abridge
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
american
citizenship.
the
rights
so
guaranteed
were
not
trivial.
the
civil
war
was
not
fought
because
states
were
attacking
people
on
the
high
seas
or
blocking
access
to
the
bureau
of
engraving
and
printing.
the
rights
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
understood
to
include
the
fundamental
rights
honored
by
any
free
government
and
the
personal
guarantees
of
the--
mr.
alan
gura
--your
honor,
the
slaughter-house
cases
should
not
have
any
stare
decisis
effect
before
the
court.
the
court
has
always
found
that
when
a
case
is
extremely
wrong,
when
there
is
a
great
consensus
that
it
was
simply
not
decided
correctly,
especially
in
a
constitutional
matter,
it
has
less
force.
mr.
alan
gura
state--
mr.
alan
gura
--justice
sotomayor,
states
may
have
grown
accustomed
to
violating
the
rights
of
american
citizens,
but
that
does
not
bootstrap
those
violations
into
something
that
is
constitutional.
mr.
alan
gura
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct.
the
framers
and
the
public
understood
the
term--
mr.
alan
gura
--although
it's
impossible
to
give
a
full
list
of
all
the
unenumerated
rights
that
might
be
protected
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
just
as
it's
impossible
to
do
so
under
the
due
process
clause,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
we
have
wonderful
historical
guideposts.
there
are--
mr.
alan
gura
--it's--
mr.
alan
gura
--it's
easier
in
terms,
perhaps,
of
--
of
the
text
and
history,
the
original
public
understanding
of--
mr.
alan
gura
--justice
scalia,
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
would
be
no,
because--
mr.
alan
gura
--no.
no.
i
have
left
law
school
some
time
ago,
and
this
is
not
an
attempt
to
--
to
return.
mr.
alan
gura
justice
scalia,
we
would
be
extremely
happy
if
the
court
reverses
the
lower
court
based
on
the
substantive
due
process
theory
that
we
argued
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and,
indeed,
had
the
seventh
circuit
accepted
our
substantive
due
process
theory,
which
was
our
primary
theory
in
the
court
below,
we
might
not
be
here,
or
perhaps
we
would
be
here
in
a
different
posture.
mr.
alan
gura
of
the
unenumerated
rights,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
alan
gura
well,
the
framers
clearly
used
language
that
to
them
meant
rights
beyond
those
guaranteed
in
the
first
eight
amendments.
and
whenever
they
spoke
about
those
unenumerated
rights,
they
gave
some
concrete
examples.
so
i
think
that
there
might
be
two
categories
of
unenumerated
rights
if
a
claim
were
before
the
court
under
that
provision.
if
a
right
is,
for
example,
the
sort
of
right
that
was
mentioned
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
the
piece
of
legislation
enacted
by
a
supermajority
of
congress,
where
the
congress
said,
over
president
johnson's
veto,
here
are
the
rights
of
american
citizenship,
and
they
are
--
they
listed:
to
make
and
enforce
contracts;
to
sue,
be
parties,
and
give
evidence;
to
inherit,
purchase,
lease,
sell,
hold,
and
convey
real
and
personal
property.
that's
the
sort
of
right
that
would
be
easy
to
find
because
there
is
a
contemporaneous
source
for
telling
us--
mr.
alan
gura
--the
large
--
the
population
at
the
time
that
did
not
have
those
rights
needed
their
protection,
primarily
in
the
south,
which
is
why
the
civil
rights
act--
mr.
alan
gura
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
alan
gura
married
women
were
considered
citizens
of
the
united
states,
just
like
children
were
considered
citizens.
however,
the
law
did
not
always
protect
people
fully,
and
we've
made
great
strides
in
this
country
giving
a
greater
level
of
protection
to
--
to
certain
rights.
we
understand
certain
rights
better
today
than
we
did
140
years
ago,
and
the
fact
that
first
amendment
rights
weren't
fully
respected,
second
amendment
rights
weren't
always
respected,
fourth
amendment
rights
were
not
always
understood
well--
mr.
alan
gura
--as
we
mentioned
--
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
this
court
in
benton
v.
maryland
decided
that
henceforth
american
history
and
tradition
are
important
to
consider
what
rights
are
protected
in
this
country.
it's
true
that
our
friends
overseas
who
have
more
or
less
civilized,
free
societies
don't
respect
rights
to
the
same
level
that
we
do.
for
example,
england,
which
is
a
free
society,
has
a
monarchy.
they
have
hereditary
lords
in
parliament.
they
don't
have
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
alan
gura
as
understood
by
the
people
who
ratified
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
not
a
free-flowing
license,
necessarily,
for
judges
to
announce
unenumerated
rights.
however,
to
the
extent
that
we
have
unenumerated
rights
which
the
framers
and
ratifiers
didn't
literally
understand,
they
nonetheless
left
us
guideposts
that
we
can--
mr.
alan
gura
--yes.
mr.
alan
gura
that's
correct
and,
as
judge
o'scannlain--
mr.
alan
gura
--in
the
ninth
circuit
observed
in
the
nordyke
decision,
the
slaughter-house
dissenters
seemed
to
arrive
at
the
same
point,
perhaps,
that
this
court
did
in
the
glucksberg
case.
mr.
alan
gura
it
would
be,
your
honor.
the
fact--
mr.
alan
gura
--the
second
amendment
is
not
so
limited
and
neither
is
the
right
to
arms,
even
outside
the
second--
mr.
alan
gura
--an
unenumerated
right
to
arms
in
the
absence
of
the
second
amendment
would
be,
perhaps
--
probably
identical
to
that
secured
by
the
second
amendment,
because
the
second
amendment
codified
the
understanding
of
that
right
that
people
have
historically
had
in
the
country.
so
there
would
not
be
a
difference
between
the
right
to
arms
if
it
were
a
part
of
the
second
amendment
or--
mr.
alan
gura
--with
respect
to
the
substantive
due
process
argument
that
we're
making?
mr.
alan
gura
we
are
not
challenging
--
we
are
not
the
party
that's
before
the
court
that
is
challenging
anything
that
has
gone
on
before
in
terms
of
substantive
due
process.
we
believe
that
those
cases
were
by
and
large
decided
appropriately,
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
reconsider
any
of
them
for
some
reason,
it
--
that
has
really
nothing
to
do--
mr.
alan
gura
--yes,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
alan
gura
--well--
mr.
alan
gura
--federal
judges
should
carry
this
out
in
the
same
way
that
was
announced
in
this
court's
decision
in
heller.
so--
mr.
alan
gura
--heller
stood
for
the
proposition
that
some
activities
are
within
the
core
boundaries
of
a
right,
and
so
long
as
people
wish
to
do
something
that
is
literally
understood
to
be
a
part
of
the
boundaries
of
the
right,
it
is
to
be
protected,
and--
mr.
alan
gura
--we
decide
that
by
looking,
not
to
which
side
has
the
better
statistics,
but
rather
to
what
the
framers
said
in
the
constitution,
because
that
policy
choice
was
made
for
us
in
the
constitution.
they--
mr.
alan
gura
--the
city
cannot
ban
guns
that
are
within
the
common
use
as
protected
by
the
right
to
arms.
mr.
alan
gura
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
as
your
opinion--
mr.
alan
gura
--that--
mr.
alan
gura
--well,
your
honor,
we
do
agree
that
statistics
are
not
important
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
right--
mr.
alan
gura
--that's
right.
mr.
alan
gura
a
legislature
should
respect
the
fact
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
at
issue,
and
this
court
in
footnote
27
in
heller
explained
that
under
the
carolene
products
paradigm,
footnote
4,
rights
enumerated
in
the
constitution
are
entitled
to
a
greater
measure
of
respect.
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
gura
sure.
mr.
alan
gura
well,
apart
from
the
second
amendment
right,
which
is
being
denied
to
people
in
the
united
states
by
chicago
at
least,
there
are
other
rights
--
other
rights
enumerated
in
the
first
eight
amendments
that
were
thought
to
be
the
personal
guarantees
as
well
as
certain
unenumerated
rights
which
were
understood
to
be
part
of--
mr.
alan
gura
--the
jury
trial--
mr.
alan
gura
--there's
not
much
left,
your
honor.
those
are
the
only
two
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
have
not
been
held
incorporated
under
due
process,
which
informs
us
that
perhaps
we
should
have
the
second
amendment
incorporated.
there's
no
reason
to
treat
it
any
differently.
with
respect
to
the
unenumerated
rights
that
perhaps
are
not
being--
mr.
alan
gura
--yes
--
well,
it's
not
just
what
we're
saying;
it's
what
the
framers
of
the
constitution
said.
and
as
justice
scalia
noted
in
apprendi,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
for
example,
may
not
be
efficient,
but
it
is
free.
mr.
alan
gura
that's
right.
we're
talking
about
the
grand
jury
clause;
we
have
28
states
right
now
out
of
the
50
that
allow
prosecutors
to
pursue
felony
charges
without
indictment
by
a
grand
jury,
but
the
other
22
states
do
require
it.
mr.
alan
gura
sure.
mr.
alan
gura
we
can't
give
a
full
description
of
all
unenumerated
rights
that
are
going
to
be
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
either--
mr.
alan
gura
--no,
it
does
not,
and
it
shouldn't
trouble
the
court
because
the
court
addresses
due
process
cases
all
the
time
without
saying
we're--
mr.
alan
gura
--the
right
to
contract--
mr.
alan
gura
--that
is
literally
understood
by
the
framers
to
be
an
unenumerated
right
under
the
privileged
immunities.
we
know
that
because
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
that's
the
very
first
right
that
they
mentioned
as
something
that
people
in
the
south
should
be
enjoying,
because
they
were
not
allowed
to
pursue
a
livelihood.
mr.
alan
gura
no,
your
honor;
our
approach
might
actually
provide
judges
with
perhaps
no
more
than
what
they
have
now,
perhaps
even
less,
because
our
approach
is
rooted
in
text
and
history.
it's
not
a
license
for
judges
to
make
up
unenumerated
rights
that
they
believe--
mr.
alan
gura
--sure.
if
i
may?
mr.
alan
gura
thanks.
we
believe
that
it's
more
limited
because
that
--
that
text
had
a
specific
understanding
and
that
there
are
guideposts
left
behind
in
texts
and
history
that
tell
us
how
to
apply
it,
unlike
the
due
process.
but
at
least
we
know
one
thing,
which
is
that,
in
1868,
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
was
understood
to
be
a
privilege
or
immunity
of
citizenship,
and
if
the
court
is
considering
watering
down
the
second
amendment,
perhaps
it
should
look
to
text
and
history.
