chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1521,
mcdonald
v.
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
gura.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
this
argument
is
contrary
to
the
slaughter-house
cases,
which
have
been
the
law
for
140
years.
it
might
be
simpler,
but
it's
a
big
--
it's
a
heavy
burden
for
you
to
carry
to
suggest
that
we
ought
to
overrule
that
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
--
in
that
context,
is
your
position
that
the
rights
that
are
incorporated
as
essential
to
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
do
they
bring
all
of
our
decisions
with
them?
when
you
say
the
first
amendment
is
covered,
does
that
mean
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
is
incorporated
as
well?
or
is
it
only
some
lesser
version
of
the
incorporated
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
still
allows
scope,
once
you
determine
that
the
right
is
incorporated,
for
recognizing
that
the
states
might
have
broader
interests
that
the
federal
government
doesn't
have.
but
i
would
suppose
that
would
come
up
in
the
application
of
the
right,
rather
than
in
an
effort
to
determine
whether
parts
of
it
are
incorporated
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
respond
if
you
want,
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
exactly
--
that's
exactly
right.
and
that
is
what
the
court
elaborated
on
in
duncan.
i
do
think
the
focus
is
our
system
of
ordered
liberty,
not
any
abstract
system
of
ordered
liberty.
you
can
say
japan
is
a
free
country,
but
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
trial
by
--
by
jury.
the
--
the
concept
only
makes
sense,
i
think,
if
you
limit
it
to
our
system.
under
our
system,
as
you
said,
the
--
the
right
to
a
jury
is
essential.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
think
that's
right,
why
wouldn't
you
think,
for
all
the
reasons
given
in
heller,
that
the
second
amendment
right
is
essential
to
our
system,
whatever
it
may
be
with
respect
to
france
or
england
or
anywhere
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
heller
and
not
take
away
from
it
the
notion
that
the
second
amendment,
whether
you'd
want
to
label
it
fundamental
or
not,
was
extremely
important
to
the
framers
in
their
view
of
what
liberty
meant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure,
and
it's
still
going
to
be
subject
to
the
political
process
if
the
court
determines
that
it's
incorporated
in
the
due
process
clause.
all
the
arguments
you
make
against
incorporation,
it
seems
to
me,
are
arguments
you
should
make
in
favor
of
regulation
under
the
second
amendment.
we
haven't
said
anything
about
what
the
content
of
the
second
amendment
is
beyond
what
was
said
in
heller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
the
argument
you
make
is,
well,
given
this
context,
you
should
not
be
able
to
have
concealed
carry.
well,
maybe
that's
right,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
don't
incorporate
the
second
amendment
to
allow
you
to
enforce
that
type
of
regulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
sounds
an
awful
lot
to
me
like
the
argument
we
heard
in
heller
on
the
losing
side.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
to
get
back
to
justice
breyer's
point,
which
i'm
not
sure
you
answered,
is
your
theory
that
you
simply
--
it's
not
a
question
of
is
it
in
or
is
it
out?
but
you're
saying,
well,
what
is
in
and
what
is
out,
are
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
it's
in
or
out,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
know
your
reasons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
take
a
position
on
whether
or
not
you
want
us
to
not
only
pick
and
choose
among
which
amendments
are
part
of
our
abstract
notion
of
ordered
liberty,
or
if
you
want
us
also
to
take
amendments
that
might
be
in
and
refine
them
and
shave
them
off
a
little
bit
and
say,
well,
this
part
of
the
amendment
is
in,
and
this
part
isn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
your
argument
is
all
in
or
all
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
how
you
think
madison
went
about
his
job?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
asking
counsel.
do
you
think
that's
how
madison
went
about
his
job?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
all
those
may
be
perfectly
valid
today,
or
--
if
the
court
incorporates
the
second
amendment.
incorporation
doesn't
say
anything
by
itself
about
whether
those
types
of
regulations,
which
you
think
are
reasonable
and
your
friends
think
may
not
be
reasonable,
are
valid
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
is
it
the
position
of
the
city
of
chicago
that
we
should
rely
on
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
griswold?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
is
no,
you're
not
going
to
follow
that
approach,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gura,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
approach
--
your
original
approach
would
give
judges
a
lot
more
power
and
flexibility
in
determining
what
rights
they
think
are
a
good
idea
than
they
have
now
with
the
constraints
of
the
due
process
clause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
privileges
and
immunities
give
you
a
lot
more
flexibility
than
due
process,
because
it's
not
limited
to
procedural
--
where
you
don't
have
to
deal
with
the
hurdle
that
it's
limited
to
procedural
by
the
text.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning,
in
case
08-1521,
mcdonald
versus
the
city
of
chicago.
