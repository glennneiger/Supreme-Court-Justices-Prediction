justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
understood
the
chief
justice's
question
--
maybe
i
misunderstood
it,
but
my
understanding
of
the
question
as
important
is
this:
under
incorporation
by
reference,
the
states
are
bound
by
the
rights
in
all
--
with
all
of
the
refinements
and
sophistication
with
which
we
interpret
them
for
the
federal
government.
it's
the
same.
you
don't
just
apply
the
core
of
the
right.
you
apply
all
of
the
right
as
it
is
elaborated
by
the
cases.
is
--
is
that
same
consequence
--
does
that
same
consequence
follow
if
we
adopt
the
privileges
and
immunities
interpretation
that
you
are
urging
upon
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
was
also
the
harlan
view,
although
a
separate
opinion
in
the
griswold
case
and
in
poe
v.
ullman.
do
you
think
that
it
best
describes
the
approach
that
the
court
has
used
over
the
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
mr.
clement
what
test
he
thought
the
court
used.
if
you
looked
at
all
the
cases,
you
think
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
its
rationale
was
that
because
of
its
fundamental
character,
the
right
to
bear
arms
must
be
understood
as
separate
from
the
qualifying
phrase
of
the
militia
clause,
all
people,
most
people
in
the
united
states.
the
public
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
was
that
there
was
an
individual
right
to
bear
arms,
and
that's
because
it
was
fundamental.
if
it's
not
fundamental,
then
heller
is
wrong,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
due
process
liberty--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
would
self-defense
be
part
of
liberty
under
the
due
--
substantive
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you've
given
--
you
said
there
were
two
reasons.
so
you
have
given
us
both
in
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
repeating
that
and
just
so
i
understand
your
position,
how
could
some
member
of
the
court
write
the
--
this
opinion
to
say
that
this
right
is
not
fundamental,
but
that
heller
was
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
--
but
there
are
provisions
of
the
constitution,
of
the
bill
of
rights,
that
have
been
incorporated
against
the
states,
where
the
states
have
substantial
latitude
and
ample
authority
to
impose
reasonable
regulations,
rights
respecting
--
rights
respecting
property,
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause.
we
look
to
see
what
the
political
process
does.
we
look
to
see
--
why
can't
we
do
the
same
thing
with
firearms?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
there
is
existing
authority
with
reference
to
other
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
would
allow
us
to
incorporate
just
the
core
of
heller
with
respect
to
the
states?
just
the
core
of
the
second
amendment
with
respect
to
the
states,
along
the
lines
to
this
question
justice
stevens
was
asking
earlier?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
so,
what's
--
what
case
do
we
look
to
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
at
the
--
at
the
very
outset
of
your
argument,
justice
sotomayor
asked
the
question
which,
as
i
understood
it,
essentially
said
what
are
examples
of
privileges
and
immunities
that
are
being
denied
by
the
states
that
--
which
denial
would
be
remedied
by
following
your
proposal
to
overrule
the
slaughter-house
case?
and
let's
leave
the
second
amendment
out.
let's
assume
the
second
amendment
is
a
wash;
it's
either
going
to
be
incorporated
or
not
going
to
be
incorporated
the
same
--
to
the
same
extent
under
either
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
or
the
due
process
clause.
leaving
the
due
process
--
the
second
amendment
out
of
it,
what
privileges
and
immunities
are
now
being
denied
citizens
of
--
of
the
united
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
examples
of
those?
the
jury
trial
in
civil
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
grand
jury.
what
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
we're
using
up
your
time.
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
want
me
to
leave
the
bench
thinking
grand
jury
indictment
and
civil
trial
and
jury
case
--
that's
it.
there's
no
other
--
what
are
these
other
unenumerated
rights?
