justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
the
rights
--
if
you
could
clarify
your
conception
of
privileges
and
immunities.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
to
keep
and
bear
arms
would
be
included
even
if
we
had
no
second
amendment,
as
you
envision
privileges
and
immunities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
just
tell
us
the
dimensions
of
what
it
is.
i
mean,
we
have
the
eight
amendments,
so
i
know
you
say
that's
included.
keep
and
bear
arms
would
be
included
even
absent
the
second
amendment.
what
unenumerated
rights
would
we
be
declaring
privileges
and
immunities
under
your
conception
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
--
that
court
does
not
have
the
prerogative
to
overturn
any
of
this
court's
decisions,
and
i
think
it
said
--
said
as
much.
so
it
was
kind
of
a
pass-through
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
i
really
would
like
you
to
answer
the
question
that
you
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
finish
answering,
and
that
is:
what
other
enumerated
rights?
what
does
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
united
states
citizenship
embrace?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
--
even
though
a
large
portion
of
the
population
at
that
time
didn't
have
those
rights?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
throughout
--
throughout
the
nation
at
the
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
married
women
at
that
time
across
the
nation
have
the
right
to
contract,
to
hold
property,
to
sue
and
be
sued?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
work
just
one
way?
i
mean,
if
the
notion
is
that
these
are
principles
that
any
free
society
would
adopt,
well,
a
lot
of
free
societies
have
rejected
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
--
then
it's
not
one
expression
of
this
unenumerated
rights,
natural
rights,
or
the
rights
that
any
free
society
--
basic
to
a
free
society.
so
you
--
you
have
to
trim
your
definition.
it's
not
basic
to
any
free
society.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
heller
--
heller
allowed
for
reasonable
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
heller
decision
allowed
for
reasonable
regulation,
and
it
gave
a
few
examples,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
saying
that
under
--
under
your
view,
every
state
would
have
to
use
a
grand
jury
to
bring
criminal
charges;
no
more
information.
and
that
every
state
would
have
to
have
a
civil
jury,
if
any
party
in
the
case
requested
it.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
a
criminal
case;
that's
quite
different.
