mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
amendment
should
not
be
incorporated
and
applied
to
the
states
because
the
right
it
protects
is
not
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty.
states
and
local
governments
have
been
the
primary
locus
of
firearms
regulation
in
this
country
for
the
last
220
years.
firearms,
unlike
anything
else
that
is
the
subject
of
a
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights,
are
designed
to
injure
and
kill.
and
the
very
same
features
that
make
firearms
valuable
for
self-defense
as
the
court
noted
in
heller
also--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
--
the
court
has
--
the
court
has
used
the
term
in
a
number
of
cases.
since
then,
it
has
used
it
in
--
not
in
corporation
cases
as
recently
as
the
glucksberg
case.
it
used
it
in
mapp.
it
has
used
it
in
other
cases,
but
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
do,
and
here's
the
reason
why.
in
1833,
this
court
has
held
in
barron
v.
baltimore,
in
a
--
in
a
ruling
that
chief
justice
marshall
said
was
not
a
difficult
one,
although
important,
that
the
bill
of
rights
did
not
apply
to
the
states.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
justice
has
ever
disagreed
with
that
--
with
that
ruling
or
suggested
he
was
wrong
in
so
ruling.
from
--
it
was
--
the
only
reason
--
and
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed
and
ratified
in
the
late
1860s,
again,
the
--
the
framers
did
not
directly
apply
the
bill
of
rights
to
the
states.
they
gave
us
some
generalities.
and
the
court
has
always
understood
that
when
it's
applying
the
due
process
clause,
what
it
asks
is
not
just
is
something
in
the
constitution,
but
is
this
something
that's
so
fundamental
it's
a
necessary
condition--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
is
in
the
following
sense:
when
you're
talking
about
a
procedural
right
that's
embedded
in
a
particular
procedural
system,
you
have
to
look
at
how
that
system
operates
and
how
the
--
the
right
works
within
that
particular
system.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
--
i
agree
--
i
--
i
think
that's
right.
i
was
just
distinguishing
between--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
question
that
the
court
was
addressing
in
heller
was
not
--
again,
was
not
how
important
the
second
amendment
right
was,
or
how
implicit
it
is
in
our
system;
it
was
what
did
it
say
and
what
did
the
--
what
restrictions
did
the
framers
of
the
second
amendment
impose
on
the
federal
government.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that's
right.
the
question
is
what
right
--
what
did
they
impose
upon
the
--
as
restrictions
upon
the
government
when
the
second
amendment
was
ratified.
and
as
to
that,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
it's
fundamental
any
more
than
with
the
grand
jury
clause
or
with
the
civil
jury
trial
right--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--under
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
--
it
was
important,
but
actually
what
heller
says
is
this:
the
second
amendment
preexisted
the
--
its
inclusion
--
or
the
right
that's
in
the
second
amendment
preexisted
its
inclusion
in
the
bill
of
rights.
but
the
reason
it
was
codified,
the
reason
it
--
the
reason
it
was
put
into
the
bill
of
rights
was
because
the
framers
were
concerned
about
the
federal
government
disarming
the
militia.
the
right
of
self-defense,
which
had
been
previously
recognized
and
highly
valued,
i
would
agree,
was
--
had
--
according
to
heller,
quote,
"had
little
to
do
with
its
codification--
"
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--with
its
inclusion
in
the
constitution.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
--
i
agree
as
far
as
the
federal
government
goes.
but
now
there's
a
different
question
being
asked,
and
the
second
amendment
in
this
respect
is
unlike
any
of
the
other
amendments
that
have
been
incorporated.
the
same
--
very
same
reason
why
the
first
--
the
various
rights
in
the
first
amendment
were
put
there
in
1791
is
exactly
the
reason
why
it
was
held
--
why
it
was
incorporated
and
applied
to
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
that
--
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
what--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
what
--
and
that's
what
heller
said.
and
here's
the
difference
--
is,
it
is
it
is
now
urged
that
this
right
is
fundamental
because
of
its
importance,
the
importance
of
firearms
in
self-defense.
that
was
true
also
in
1791,
but
it
wouldn't
have
been
in
the
constitution
for
that.
that
had
little
to
do
with
putting
it
in
the
constitution.
this
is
a
right
that
has
always
been
subject
to
the
political
process
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
--
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
--
the
argument
that
i'm
making
is
that
states
and
local
governments
under
the
political
process,
which
as
far
as
we
know,
if
the
only
issue
had
been
self-defense,
the
framers
would
have
been
satisfied
to
leave
this
to
the
states
and
to
leave
this
to
the
political
process,
and
not
to
put
it
in
the
constitution
--
that
--
that
--
that
as
far
as
the
right
to
self-defense
goes,
that's
something
that
has
always
been
effectively
regulated
through
the
political
process
and
especially
at
the
state
and
local
level.
and
through
our
history,
as
technology
has
changed,
state
and
local
regulation
has
altered
to
draw
the
balance
that
has
to
be
drawn.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
the
state
and
local
government
did
that,
i
think
would
it
raise
two
questions.
one
question
would
be,
there
is
always
review
under
the
due
process
clause
and
under
the
equal
protection
clause
for
provisions
that
are
arbitrary.
and
i'd
want
to
know
why
a
state
had
done
that.
it's
certainly
relevant
that
in
the
last
220
years,
no
state
has
done
that
or
even
come
close,
and,
in
fact,
as
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
from
some
of
the
states
show,
they
are
quite
in
the
opposite
direction.
but
the
second
point
would
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
there's
always--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
that
has--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
has
not
led
to
states
doing
it
in
--
in
this
country.
the
second
question--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
the
second
--
there
would
be
two
questions
actually.
one
would
be
was
this
arbitrary,
or
is
that
actually
based
on
a
reason
that's
--
a
sound
reason?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
second
argument
would
be,
the
court
at
that
point,
if
in
the
very
unlikely
event
a
that
a
state
or
local
government
tried
to
do
that,
then
the
court
might
have
to
wrestle
at
that
point
with
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
self-defense
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
in
other
words,
this
court
has
never
said--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
mean,
if
by
that
is,
do
you
have
a
substantive
right
to
self-defense,
the
court
actually
has
never
answered
that
question,
but
i'm
willing
to
accept
that
there
is
such
a
right
for--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
and
--
and
what
i'd
say
about
the
right
to
self-defense
is,
if
--
if
the
challenge
--
if
a
state
or
local
government
banned
all
firearms
it
might
raise
the
question
of,
given
that
there
--
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
self-defense,
has
the
state
prohibited
you
from
reasonable
means
of
exercising
that
right?
but
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
--
the
court
would
just
say
that
what
heller
held
was
if
you
look
at
the
meanings
that
the
words
in
the
second
amendment
had,
the
common
meaning
--
as
the
court
said
in
the
heller
opinion
--
the
common
meanings
that
the
word
had
in
1791,
it
imposed
limitation
on
the
state.
it
took
a
preexisting
right
that
had
not
been
--
it
was
not
codified
in
the
constitution,
and
it
said,
this
self-defense
right
we
need
in
the
constitution
in
order
--
in
order
to
protect
the
militia
against
being
disarmed
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
it's
actually
what
the
court
said
in
its
opinion.
what
the
court
said
in
its
opinion
is
the
reason
it
was
codified
was
the
concern
that
the
framers
had
with
the
--
that
the
federal
government
might
disarm
the
militia.
not
self-defense.
self-defense
according
to
the
court
in
heller,
quote,
"had
little
to
do
with
the
codification
of
the
right.
"
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
that
--
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
--
that's
correct,
and
i'm
not
arguing
today
about
what
it
consists
of,
but
the
point
being
that
this
was
a
right
that
had
been
--
that
the
framers
as
far
as
we
know
would
have
been
satisfied
to
leave
to
the
political
process
if
it
was
just
a
question
of
the
feature
of
it.
but
today--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
that
was
recognized
--
i
don't
think
actually
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
itself
is.
perhaps
the
right
to
self-defense
is,
and
then
like
other
rights,
similar
rights,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
that
is
constitutionally
protected,
the
question
would
be
is
the
state
now
giving
you
sufficient
means
to
exercise
that
right?
not
whatever
means
you
want,
but
sufficient
means
so
that
you
reasonably
can
exercise
that
right.
i
would
think
that
would
be
the
only
way
that
that
kind
of
analysis
could
go,
if
you
start
off
from
self-defense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
but
i
--
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
the
argument
--
the
primary
argument
that's
being
made
today,
that
this
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
or
sufficiently
fundamental
or
whichever
other
formulas--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i'm
not.
no--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
--
i
think
that
few
people
today
would
say
--
and
in
fact
few
people
in
1868
would
say
that
the
concern
to
protect
the
state
militias
is
something
that's
so
fundamental
or
essential
to
a
concept
of
ordered
liberty
or
central
to
our
system
that
it
has
to
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--protected--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
--
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
possible,
but
another
--
another
way
to
look
at
it
is
that
the
question
that
the
court
had
--
the
court
has
never
answered
the
question,
is
this
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
or
should
this
be
incorporated
under
any
other
test?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
by
just--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
the
court
would.
and
what
i
was
really
responding
to
justice
breyer
was,
we
understand
that
the
second
amendment
is
in
the
constitution
and
binds
the
federal
government,
but
it
has
always
been
understood,
from
1868
on,
that
before
an
amendment
applies
to
the
states,
you
need
something
more
than
just
finding
that
it's
in
the
constitution,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
--
actually
my
--
excuse
me.
my
answer
to
the
question
would
be
it's
--
i
think
it's
out,
because
all
that
shows
is
the
framers
certainly
had--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
--
i
think
the
best
argument
is
that
it's
out,
for
this
reason:
when
the
framers--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--okay.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
that's
not
the
argument
that
we're
making.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
argument
that
we're
making
--
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
argument
that
we're--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
--
in
our
view,
the
things
that
the
framers
--
the
framers
had
their
reasons
for
putting--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
no,
i
think
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
framers
had
reasons
to
put
everything
in
the
constitution
that
they
put
in
it.
but
the
question
about
whether
it
should
be
incorporated
against
the
states
is
a
different
question
than
whether
they
put
it
in
the
constitution.
and
what
you
have
in
the
second
amendment
--
and
it's
right
clear
on
the
face
of
it
from
the
prologue;
it's
clear
--
it's
clear
from
the
opinion
in
heller
--
is
the
reason
they
put
it
in
the
constitution
is
not
the
primary
reason
why
people
today
are
arguing
that
this
is
a
right
that
--
that
is
so
fundamental
that
it
has
to
be
applied
against
the
states.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that's
the
underlying
standard,
but
the
court
has
certainly
looked
at
our
history
and
our
traditions
in
answering
this
question,
and
i
think
they
are
relevant
in
this
area,
as
they
were--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
would
say
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
and
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
not.
we
have
discussed
already
1791,
and
the
reasons
why
--
the
reasons
even
that
the
framers
thought
that
--
well,
i've
already
discussed
that.
i
don't
want
to
go
into
it
again.
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
--
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
--
what
the
court
actually
said
in
heller
was
that
there
were
two
states
at
the
time,
in
1791,
that
had
a
firearms
right,
and
with
--
there
were
possibly
two
more
where
the
evidence
was
a
little
bit
more
ambiguous.
as
far
as
today,
it
is
true
that
44
states
have
some
kind
of
recognition
of
a
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
now,
some
of
those
states
--
a
couple
of
them,
at
least,
two
to
four
--
recognize
that
only
in
connection
with
the
militia,
and
it's
really
quite
different
from
the
right
that
this
court
recognized
in
heller.
many
other
of
the
rights
that
are
recognized
in
state
constitutions
include
provisions
that
really
would
be
unheard
of,
and
that
actually
point
to
the
reasons
why
this
is
not
fundamental,
like,
say,
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
religion.
they
have
provisions
that
say:
subject
to
such
regulation
as
the
legislature
may
prescribe,
or
the
like.
and
that
points
out
the
other
difference.
because
firearms
are
--
the
same
features
that
make
them
useful
for
self-defense
make
them
also
useful
as
instruments
of
violent
crime,
suicide,
and
accidental
death.
their
--
regulation
of
these
items
has
--
is
a
part
of
our
tradition
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
think
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--with
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
overwhelming
consensus
among
the
state
courts
in
interpreting
the
wide
variety
of
different
types
of
provisions
that
they
have
is
that
it
imposes
a
reasonable
regulation
standard
that
is
not
violated
by
banning
a
particular
weapon
or
a
particular
class
of
weapons,
as
long
as
you
are
allowing
some
kind
of
firearm,
and
that
is
not
the
right
that
this
court--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--recognized
in
heller.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
--
i
didn't
think
i
was.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
what
i'm--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
what
i'm
saying
--
i'm
sorry.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
right
that
is
embodied
in
the
wide
variety
of
different
state
constitutions
--
the
overwhelming
consensus
is
that
what
the
states
have
determined
as
a
result
of
their
own
processes
and
in
light
of
their
own
conditions
is
that
you
can't
ban
all
kinds
of
firearms,
but
you
can
ban
some
kinds
of
firearms.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
that
is
--
and
the
kinds
of
firearms
that
have
traditionally
been
banned--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
well
--
and
the
kinds
of
firearms
that
have
traditionally
been
banned
by
the
states
and
that
actually
the
period
around
the
time
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
a
good
period
to
look.
at
or
around
that
time,
there
are
numerous
states
that
had
regulations
barring
the
carrying
and
even
that
go
up
to
the
point
of
possession
of
pistols
and
bowie
knives,
which
are
not
firearms,
but
are
also
arms
under
the
second
amendment,
and
so
on.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
court
in
heller
did
hold
that
a
ban
on
--
a
ban
on
handguns
is
invalid.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
case.
and
these
are
--
these
were
laws
that
were
passed
that
are
very
close
to
that.
in
the
1860s
and
the
1870s,
in
texas,
in
wyoming,
places
that
--
not
necessarily
for
the
whole
state--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they
banned
--
i
--
well,
not
--
i
can't
say
that
they
banned
handguns
in
the
home
per--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
if
you
look
at
the
decision
--
no,
if
you
look
at
--
actually,
if
you
look
at
the
decisions,
some
of
them
banned
the
sale;
they
banned
carrying
them
anywhere
in
the
jurisdiction,
and
in
such
a
way
that
--
and
some
of
the
judicial
decisions
even
say:
this
was
intended
to
eliminate
these
weapons
from
our
jurisdiction.
and
they
were
generally
upheld
at
that
time.
now,
those
were
responding
to
local
conditions
at
the
time,
and
generally,
the
history
of
firearms
regulation,
because
of
the
risk
that
firearms
pose,
has
been
that
in
this
country,
it
has
been
widely
recognized
that
in
many
places
it's
appropriate
to
carry
firearms.
and
many
jurisdictions
have
found,
and
reasonably
found,
that
allowing
broad
use,
carriage,
and
whatever
of
firearms
is
appropriate,
but
there
are
some
jurisdictions
that
have
found
that's
not
to
be
the
case,
throughout
our
history.
and
that
has
been
a
state
and
local
decision
that
has
worked
through
the
political
process
in
those
jurisdictions.
and
that
political
process
here
is
another
distinction
between
the
second
amendment
and
some
of
the
other
amendments
that
have
been
incorporated
--
is
that
one
basis,
i
think,
for
incorporating
the
other
amendments
and
for
applying
them
against
the
states
has
been
that
there
is
a
concern
about
a
discrete
minority
or
a
highly
unpopular
view
that's
not
going
to
get
a
fair
shake
in
the
political
process.
i
don't
think
that
has
ever
been
the
case
here.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
framers
didn't
think
that
was
the
case
with
respect
to
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
it's
a
right
that
gets
controlled
in
accordance
with
local
conditions,
with
local
cultures,
and
with
local
views
about
the
necessarily
difficult
questions
about
how
best
to
protect
public
safety.
that
is
--
that
has
been
a
part
of
our
--
of
our
history
since
1860,
since--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
it's
just
that
the
end
--
i
have
really
two
points
i'd
like
to
make
about
that.
one
is
the
analysis
the
court
used
in
heller.
in
heller,
what
the
court
said
is:
this
is
not
the
time
to
balance
things;
you
cannot
ban
handguns.
now,
there
may
be
local
--
there
have
been
local
jurisdictions
before
and
there
are
now
ones
where
they
feel
allowing
some
firearms,
but
banning
handguns,
is
the
best
way
to
achieve
public
safety
and
to
increase
the
zone
of
ordered
liberty
for
their
people.
and
those
things
would
be
apparently
impermissible
under
heller.
but
even
more
than
that,
heller
construed
the
second
amendment's
"bear"
--
the
word
"bear",
"to
keep
and
bear
arms"
--
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
"carry"
in
this
court's
case
in
muscarello,
much
later.
and
to
carry
--
generally
to
carry.
many
--
there's
a
long
history
of
regulation
of
not
just
concealed
carry,
as
the
court
did
recognize
in
heller,
but
of
banning
open
carry
in
a
variety
of
jurisdictions.
again,
generally,
it's
someplace
that
is
--
it
has
a
particular
problem;
it's
a
city
or
something
like
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
that
there
would
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
really
this
--
i
cannot
offhand
think
of
a
case
that
would
lead
you
to
that
--
would
lead
to
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
actually
the
other
point
i
make
is
if
you
approach
it
from
the
other
point
of
view,
the
case
has
not
been
made
here
--
it
hasn't
even
been
brought
--
that
the
city
of
chicago
is
denying
people
the
--
the
right
to
have
any
kind
of
firearm
or
the
right
to
have
any
kind
of
reasonable
means
of
self-defense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
what
i
would
say
is
that
--
what
i
would
say
is
that
if
the
court
--
what
i
was
saying
is
that
if
the
court
approaches
it
from
the
standpoint
of
perhaps
if
there
is
--
if
the
court
chooses
in
an
appropriate
case
to
recognize
a
fundamental
right
to
self-defense,
it
would
then
raise
those
kinds
of
questions.
and
someone
could
make
the
case
that
they
are
being
denied
any
right
to
self-defense
or
any
reasonable
right
to
exercise
self-defense
because
of
a
jurisdiction's
firearms
regulations;
the
court
could
address
that.
that's
not
a
claim
that
has
been
made
in
this
case;
that's
not
a
claim
that
could
be
made
in
this
case
because--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
actually
i
--
i
don't
want
to
impose
that
on
the
states.
i
think
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
court
would
ever
be
called
upon
to,
because
our
history
for
the
last
200
years
--
220
years
had
been
of
reasonable
state
and
local
regulation
of
firearms
that
responds
to
local
conditions,
to
local
threats
of
violence,
and
so
on
that
occur.
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
think
that
there
will
be
a
jurisdiction
that
would
try
to
sufficiently
ban
firearms
that
people
wouldn't
have
a
reasonable
means
of
self-defense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
the
district
of
columbia
in
any
event
is
controlled
by
second
amendment
as
it
--
as
it's
written.
that's
not
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
there
is
the
reasonable
regulation
standard.
there's
an
article
by
professor
winkler
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
goes
very
extensively
through
the
ways
that
state
courts
have
dealt
with
their
own
rights
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
have
adopted,
really
by
overwhelming
consensus,
that
kind
of
a
reasonable
regulation
standard,
which
generally
recognizes--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--excuse
me.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
well,
it's
just
our
view
would
be
that
what
chicago
has
done
here,
which
is
permit
you
to
have
a
--
permit
you
to
have
long
guns
but
ban
handguns,
is
the
kind
of
regulation
that
throughout
our
history
jurisdictions
in
their
own
--
that
are
most
familiar
with
their
own
particular
needs,
their
own
particular
problems,
and
in
a
position
to
balance
the
--
the
need
for
self-defense
with
the
risks
to
the
use
of
firearms
--
for
violence,
for
accidental
death,
and
for
suicide
--
that
the
city
of
chicago
has
come
up
with
something
that
is
well
within
our
tradition.
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
--
i
think
that,
if
i
may
--
that
the
restriction
that
the
second
amendment
imposes
on
the
federal
government
should
be
and
is
controlled
by
what
the
meaning
of
that
second
amendment
was
in
1791.
it
shouldn't
vary
one
way
or
the
other
with
whether
there's
incorporation
against
the
states.
thank
you.
