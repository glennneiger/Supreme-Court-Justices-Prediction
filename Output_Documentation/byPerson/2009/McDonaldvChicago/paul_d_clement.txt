mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
this
court's
existing
jurisprudence,
the
case
for
incorporating
the
second
amendment
through
the
due
process
clause
is
remarkably
straightforward.
the
second
amendment,
like
the
first
and
the
fourth,
protects
a
fundamental
preexisting
right
that
is
guaranteed
to
the
people--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
in
that
respect
the
sixth
amendment
is
a
bit
of
an
outlier.
for
most
of
the
provisions
and
as
far
as
i
know
all
of
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
have
been
incorporated
against
the
states,
this
court
has
incorporated
basically
all
the
jurisprudence
that
comes
with
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
guess
maybe
it's
mapp,
is
one
way
of
thinking
about
it.
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
could
quibble
about
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
sure.
we
could
quibble
whether
--
i
think
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
more
of
a
substantive
guarantee.
but
in
any
event,
with
respect
to
certainly
like
the
first
amendment
guarantees
that
this
court
has
incorporated
through
the
liberty
--
the
liberty
subclause,
if
you
will,
of
the
due
process
clause,
there
too
i
think
this
court
--
certainly
i
understand
this
court's
jurisprudence
as
incorporating
all
of
the
cases
that
go
along
with
that.
so
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
is
the
law
of
all
50
states,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
and
i
think
that
in
a
sense
the
virtue
of
that
approach
is
probably
even
more
apparent
with
the
second
amendment
than
it
might
be
with
some
other
jurisprudence--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
also
right,
your
honor,
though
i
guess
i
would
stress
that
i
think
that,
whatever
the
debate's
about
substantive
due
process
when
it
comes
to
unenumerated
rights,
i
think
the
gist
of
this
court's
incorporation
doctrine
is
that
the
textual
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
stand
in
a
favored
position
with
respect
to
incorporation.
and
so
glucksberg
has
its
discussion
about
the
standard
for
unenumerated
rights,
but
it
starts
that
off
by
saying
of
course
the
bill
of
rights
are
different.
and,
of
course,
the
bill
of
rights,
i
think,
as
i
read
this
court's
selective--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
though,
it's
interesting
that
the
one
place
that
i
--
that
i
see
where
the
court
has
not
effectively
translated
all
the
case
law
is
one
of
the
procedural
rights,
the
sixth
amendment
criminal
jury
right.
and
i
think
with
respect
to
the
substantive
rights
--
and
i
think
the
alliance
here
or
the
similarity
between
the
first
and
the
second
amendments
are
very
stark
in
this
respect
--
this
court
has
incorporated
essentially
not
just
the
amendment
and
not
just
the
right,
but
all
of
the
jurisprudence
as
well.
and,
you
know,
i
would
--
just
to
dwell
for
a
moment
if
i'd
could
on
the
--
on
the
first
and
the
second
amendment,
i
think
it's
striking,
very
striking,
that
if
this
court's
not
going
to
reconsider
its
privileges
or
immunities
clause
jurisprudence,
the
cruikshank
case
actually
stands
as
very
good
precedent
for
incorporating
the
second
amendment,
just
as
it
was
the
precedent
this
court
relied
on
in
incorporating
the
assembly
and
petition
rights
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
de
jonge
case.
and
the
reason
is
cruikshank
--
the
whole
reason
that
cruikshank
said
the
first
and
second
amendments
aren't
privileges
of
national
citizenship
is
because
they
were
preexisting
rights
that
didn't
depend
on
the
constitution
for
their
existence.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
pretty
good
working
definition
of
what
a
fundamental
right
is,
one
that
is
so
fundamental
and
basic
that
it
preexisted
our
very
constitution.
and
so
it's
not
surprising
that
de
jonge
cited
cruikshank
as
favorable
precedent
for
incorporation.
i
think
the
exact
same
logic
would
apply
to
the
second
amendment
here,
and,
as
i
say,
i
do
think
the
consequence
of
that,
certainly
the
most
logical
consequence,
would
be
to
carry
over
the
jurisprudence
under
the
second
amendment.
now,
right
now,
that's
not
carrying
over
a
lot,
right?
that's
carrying
over
the
heller
case.
but
i
think
in
a
way
that
points
up
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
virtues
of
incorporation
is
that,
because
the
miller
decision
of
this
court
sowed
confusion,
we
don't
have
substantial
second
amendment
jurisprudence.
and
i
would
think
that
it's
going
to
be
difficult
enough
to
develop
the
second
amendment
jurisprudence
that
you
wouldn't
want
to
make
it
more
difficult
by
having
to
develop
a
federal
second
amendment
jurisprudence
and
then
some
sort
of
shadow
version
of
that
jurisprudence
for
the
states.
and
i
think
in
the
more
recent
incorporation
cases,
this
court
was
quite
candid
that
it
wasn't
going
to
adopt
sort
of
a
shadow
version
of
the
federal
guarantee
or
some
watered-down
version
of
the
federal
guarantee,
but
it
really
saw
the
virtue
of
incorporating
not
just
the
right
but
the
jurisprudence
that
came
with
that
right.
and
so
i
do
think
that's
in
a
sense
something
that
counts
in
favor
of
incorporating
the
second
amendment
and
doing
so
through
the
due
process
clause,
the
same
way
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
other
substantive
guarantees
of
the
bill
of
rights.
and
i
think
if
you
apply
that
jurisprudence,
the
case
really
is
very
straightforward.
in
fact,
i
think
if
you
compare
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
second
amendment,
they
have
the
same
textual
guarantee
to
the
people,
they
trace
their
origins
to
preexisting
rights
back
to
the
english
bill
of
rights,
back
to
even
earlier
constitutional
history.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
--
and,
again,
justice
stevens,
you
know,
since
i
think
that
--
that
the
incorporation
clause
is
--
i
mean,
the
incorporation
jurisprudence
is,
to
put
it
lightly,
a
gloss
on
the
text
of
the
due
process
clause--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right.
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
but
i
guess
i
would
say
is
that,
putting
the
sixth
amendment
to
one
side,
which
i
think
is
a
bit
of
an
outlier
in
the
jurisprudence
here,
i
think
the
trend
of
all
of
this
court's
incorporation
jurisprudence
has
been
more
towards
complete
incorporation
of
the
right
and
the
jurisprudence.
so
--
i
mean,
mapp
is
a
perfect
illustration.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
the
same
thing
can
be
said
for
any
other
one
of
the
other
incorporated
amendments.
so
i
think
the
same
thing
might
be
true
in
the
first
amendment.
there
are
certainly
going
to
be
situations
that
the
federal
government
confronts
that
the
state
governments
won't
confront
the
exact
analogue
situation
and
vice
versa.
now,
you
know,
there
may
be
unique
issues
about
national
parks
that
the
states
aren't
going
to
have
to
confront,
and
the
jurisprudence
can
take
that
into
account.
but
i
think
that's
far
different
from
saying
that
we
really
are
going
to
have
this
shadow
jurisprudence
for
one
of
the
provisions.
and
i
think,
again,
to
go
back
to
mapp
just
as
an
illustration,
when
this
court
first
incorporated
the
fourth
amendment
and
said,
well,
we'll
talk
about
the
exclusionary
rule
later;
maybe
we
won't
incorporate
the
fourth
--
the
exclusionary
rule.
we'll
just
incorporate
the
fourth
amendment's
basic
guarantee.
and
the
trend
of
later
cases
was
to
say,
no,
kind
of
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--let's
bring
the
jurisprudence
with--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
harlan
was
a
terrific
justice.
justice
black
was
a
terrific
justice
in--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
his
total
incorporation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
if
we
are
going
to
go
back,
maybe
we
should
go
back
to
the
first
justice
harlan,
who
actually
had
an
--
an
approach,
i
think,
that
would
be
much
more
similar
to
the
approach--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
we
take
in
this
case
and
that
mr.
gura
takes
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
mean,
i
guess
what
i
--
what
i
don't
understand
is
why,
given
the
way
that
this
court
wrestled
in
the
heller
decision
with
how
to
basically
apply
the
operative
clause
in
light
of
the
prefatory
clause,
why
one
would
want
to
come
to
a
different
conclusion--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect
to
the
states.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean,
obviously
this
court
was
focused
very
much
on
blackstone's
writings
in
the
heller
decision,
and
i
think
the
majority
read
blackstone
actually
as
being
primarily
concerned
with
the
self-defense
right,
which
goes
a
long
way
to
understand
why
the
heller
decision
came
out
the
way
that
it
came
out.
and
i
would
simply
finish
by
noting
that
the
one
thing
that
i
think
we
can
come
to
a
conclusion
about
blackstone
is
the
very
fact
that
blackstone
dwelled
on
the
right
is
good
evidence
that
it's
a
fundamental
right
that
should
apply
to
the
states.
