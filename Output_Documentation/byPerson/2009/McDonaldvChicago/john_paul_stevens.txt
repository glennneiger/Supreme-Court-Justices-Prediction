mr.
gura,
can
i
ask
you
the
same
question
justice
ginsburg
asked
about:
what
if
there
were
no
second
amendment?
you
say
the
right
would
still
be
protected
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
what
about
--
would
it
also
be
protected
under
substantive
due
process
if
there
were
no
second
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
the
--
the
importance
of
the
right
to
protection
--
and
would
that
apply
to
the
entire
scope
of
the
second
amendment
or
just
the
right
to
keep
the
gun,
a
homeowner's
right
to
keep
a
gun
for
self-protection
against
intruders
into
the
home,
under
the
--
without
the
second
amendment,
just
the
liberty
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
we
don't
have
a
second
amendment
for
purposes
of
the
substantive
due
process
analysis.
i'm
asking
you
what
is
the
scope
of
the
right
to
own
a
gun
that
is
protected
by
the
liberty
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
is
it
just
the
right
to
have
it
at
--
at
home,
or
is
the
right
to
parade
around
the
streets
with
guns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clement,
would
you
comment
on
justice
kennedy's
question
about
whether
that
necessarily
incorporates
every
jot
and
tittle
of
the
federal
right
into
the
federal,
keeping
in
mind
that
with
regard
to
trial
by
jury
in
criminal
cases,
there's
a
difference.
it's
nonunanimous
juries.
why
does
this
incorporation
have
to
be
every
bit
as
broad
as
the
second
amendment
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
last
case
in
which
we
incorporated
a
substantive
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mapp
was
a
procedural
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mapp
was
a
fourth
amendment
case.
i'm
asking
you
cases
involving
incorporation
of
substantive
rights,
as
opposed
to
procedural
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
procedural
cases
come
in
under
the
due
process
language,
but
the
substantive
cases
comes
under
the
word
"liberty",
and
"liberty"
picks
up
the
first
amendment
and
so
forth.
and
i
take
it
it's
the
word
"liberty"
that
picks
up
the
second
amendment.
and
if
it
does,
why
does
it
have
to
be
precisely
the
same
scope
as
the
second
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
stand
in
a
favored
position,
but
we've
never
said
had
to
be
literally
all
the
way
down
the
line,
or
we
couldn't
have
done
the
criminal
jury
--
nonunanimous
criminal
jury
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true
of
the
criminal
jury
trial
right,
too,
all
of
those
things?
and
yet
we
don't
--
it's
not
exactly
the
same.
i
just
don't
see
why
it
has
to
be
exactly
the
same.
i
can
understand
your
argument
that
it
should
be
substantially
the
same,
but
i
don't
see
that
there's
anything
in
the
text
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
would
justify
saying
it
must
be
precisely
the
same,
or
of
any
of
our
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
incorporation
jurisprudence
is
--
we
haven't
had
an
incorporation
case
for
30
years
or
more.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
--
you're
dead
right--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
the
majority
of
the
court,
but
it's
interesting
that
during
this
whole
period,
justice
harlan
staked
out
a
separate
position
on
whether
it
should
be
just
the
substance
of
the
right
or
the
--
every
detail.
and
we
have
followed
justice
harlan,
rather
than
the
majority
in
a
number
of
cases
in
--
in
the
recent
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
is
very
much
against
you,
and
he's
a
very
important
member
of
our
--
of
our
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
look
to
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
griswold,
where
he
says
the
fourteenth
amendment
stands
on
its
own
bottom
and
it
can
be
either
more
or
less
than
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights,
and
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
why
this
court
could
not
adopt
the
same
position
here
and
say:
insofar
it's
incorporated,
it
applies
only
within
the
home.
the
court
had
ample
precedent
for
that.
