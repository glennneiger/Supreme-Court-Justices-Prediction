what

liberty
been
badly
affected?
justice

mr.
feldman,
our
selective
incorporation
doctrine
under
the
due
process
clause
does
suggest
that
there
are
some
rights
that
were
fundamental
enough
to
be
incorporated
and
some
that
are
fundamental,
but
not
fundamental
enough
to
be
incorporated.
we've
drawn
a
line.
is
it
the
ordered
liberty
concept
alone
in
our
jurisprudence
that
you
are
relying
upon,
or
is
it
any
other
articulation
of
our
incorporation
doctrine
that
supports
your
view?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the

says:
yes,
if
we
look
at
it,
we
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
our
history,
our
structure.
so
address
his
question
as
to
why--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
our
structure
or
our
history,
it's
not
fundamental
enough--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
incorporate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
be
happy
if
we
incorporated
it
and
said
reasonable
regulation
is
part
of
the
incorporation?
and
how
do
we
do
that?
