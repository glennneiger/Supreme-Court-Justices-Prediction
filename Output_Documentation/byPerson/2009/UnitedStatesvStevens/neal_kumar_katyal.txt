mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ten
years
ago,
in
section
48
of
title
18,
congress
crafted
a
narrowly
targeted
restriction
against
certain
depictions
of
actual
animal
cruelty.
yet
the
third
circuit
struck
the
statute
down
on
its
face
without
even
attempting
to
apply
substantial
overbreadth
analysis.
the
statute
has
four
critical
features
and,
just
as
the
court
last
year
in
united
states
v.
williams
began
with
statutory
construction,
analysis
should
begin
there.
first,
like
the
statute
at
issue
in
the
united
states
v.
ferber,
this
statute
only
reaches
depictions
of
cruelty
to
actual
living
beings
--
animals,
not
simulated
ones
or
the
written
word.
second,
the
statute
only
applies
to
commercial
messages,
ones
that
congress
found
drove
the
market
for
animal
cruelty.
third,
the
statute
examines
the
work
as
a
whole--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--before
congress?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
before
congress
--
congress
had
a
bunch
of
testimony
that
showed
that
there
were
extensive
--
there
was
a
robust
market
in
animal
cruelty
videos,
largely
focusing
on
crush
videos
--
2
to
3,000
crush
videos
that
were
in
--
that
were
--
that
were
being
sold
at
the
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
hunting
we
think
is
excluded,
and
i
could
talk
about
that
in
a
moment,
from
the
reach
of
the
act.
congress
spoke
in
general
terms,
and
i
don't
think
that
mr.
stevens's
statement
at
page
13
of
his
merits
brief,
which
is
to
the
effect
that
congress
repeatedly
disavowed
any
attempt
to
regulate
animal
fighting
--
dog
fighting
--
i
don't
think
that
is
correct
and
the
record
does
not
support
that.
congress
spoke
in
general
terms.
they
had
a
for-profit
commercial
market
about
animal
cruelty,
and
the
statute
dealt
with
it
in
general
terms.
and
they
reasoned
that
by
--
by
punishing
the
sale
of
these
videotapes,
they
would
get
at
the
underlying
clandestine
market--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes.
and
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
struck
down
the
statute
with
respect
to
crush
videos,
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
video
--
the
creation
of
dog
fighting
videotapes,
because,
remember,
the
statute,
section
48,
doesn't
just
encompass
the
--
the
sale
of
videotapes.
it
also
encompasses
the
creation
of
dog
fighting
videotapes.
and,
yet,
the
--
the
third
circuit
struck
that
down
as
well.
that,
i
think,
was
a
fundamental
error
under
this
court's
principles,
most
particularly,
united
states
v.
williams,
which
says
that
the
statute
should
only
be
struck
down
if
there
is
a
substantial
--
if
there
is
substantial
overbreadth
and
only
if
it
is
a
last
resort
of
the
court,
not
the
first.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
in
one
sentence,
if
--
if
--
if
congress
sees
a
compelling
interest
in
regulating
the
means
of
production
and
does
not
target
the
underlying
content,
they
can
--
they
can
regulate
a
depiction,
so
long
as
it
leaves
alternative
mechanisms
for
that
expression
in
--
in
place,
and
that
is
i
think
what
ferber--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--united
states
v.
ferber
--
new
york
v.
ferber.
in
ferber,
the
court
--
the
court
dealt,
as
modified
or
as
glossed
by
your
decision
in
free
speech
coalition,
because
what
ferber
and
free
speech
coalition
together
say
is
that
congress
was
not
--
or
the
legislature,
was
not
targeting
the
contents
of
a
depiction;
rather,
it
was
trying
to
get
at
and
dry
up
the
underlying
market,
child
exploitation
in
that
case.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
this
case
is
fundamentally
different
from
all
of
those
because
here
congress
is
not
aiming
at
the
underlying
communicative
impact.
it's
not
saying,
as
it
was
in
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--quite
to
the
contrary,
justice
scalia.
the
bona
fides
of
this
statute
are
evident
right
on
its
face,
because
the
very
same
depictions
that
mr.
stevens
or
anyone
else
swept
up
under
the
statute
wants
to
portray,
they
can
--
they
can
do
it,
so
long
as
they
use
simulated
or
images.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
think
so,
for
two
reasons.
i
think
what
congress
is
dealing
with
with
the
exemptions
clause
in
this
statute
was
just
reflecting
the
underlying
nature
of
the
market
that
they
saw
in
1999,
a
for-profit
commercial
market
in
cruelty.
and
so
they
exempted
educational
depictions,
religious,
and
so
on,
because
that
wasn't
what
was
driving
the
underlying
market
for
crush
videos--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
often
they
will
fall
under
that
exemption.
my
point
is
that
congress
carved
a
broad
exemption
in
section
48
precisely
to
make
sure
that
expressive
messages
aren't
swept
up.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
line
will
sometimes
be
difficult
to
draw,
just
as
its
difficult
to
draw
in
child
pornography--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--quite
to
the
contrary,
justice
sotomayor.
in
this
--
this
court
approved,
in
osborne
v.
ohio,
a
statute
that's
on
child
pornography,
that
had
the
following
exemption:
for
a,
quote,
"bona
fide
artistic,
educational,
religious,
governmental,
judicial,
or
other
purpose
by
or
to
a
physician,
psychologist,
sociologist,
persons
pursuing
bona
fide
research
studies,
a
judge
or
other
persons
having
a
proper
interest
in
the
material
or
performance.
"
and
this
court
pointed
to
that
exemptions
clause
to
make
the
statute
constitutional
at
two
--
at
two
pages
in
that
opinion.
and
so
this
court
has
already
gone
down
the
path
of
saying
these
decisions
are
tough
to
make
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
but
nonetheless
the
legislature
should
have
a
freer
hand
to
act
when
it
is
regulating,
not
the
expressive
message,
but
targeting
the
underlying
content,
the
--
targeting
the
underlying
production,
not
the
content.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
want
to
answer
your
hypothetical,
but
if
i
could
just
have
20
seconds
or
so
to
--
to
respond
more
generally
to
all
of
these
hypotheticals
which
i
think
are
going
to
reoccur
in
the
course
of
our
conversation.
we
believe
that
section
48
will
have
as-applied
constitutional
challenges
that
will
be
inferred
from
case
to
case.
but
what
this
court
has
said
is
that,
in
your
decision,
justice
scalia,
in
united
states
v.
williams,
is
that
we
should
be
careful
about
that
endless
stream
of
fanciful
hypotheticals
precisely
because
the
test
under
substantial
overbreadth,
which
knocks
an
entire
act
of
congress
out
on
its
face,
is
that
there
must
be
a
realistic
danger
that
the
statute
will
be
applied
in
--
in
the
manner
the
hypothetical
suggests.
with
respect
to
your
bullfighting
hypothetical,
there
is
no
realistic
danger.
we
have
had
ten
years
of
experience
under
the
statute.
congress
itself
said
--
the
legislative
history,
which
i
know
will
not
be
of
relevance
to
you
but
may
to
others
on
the
court
--
they
explicitly
exempted
spanish
bullfighting
and
said
that
is
the
paradigmatic
case
of
what
is
educational
and
artistic
and
the
like.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
spanish
depictions
of
bullfighting--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
that
is
true
because
it
is
educational,
and
--
and
a
prosecutor
would
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
some
dogfights
certainly
are,
which
is
my
answer
to
justice
sotomayor's
question.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
have
had
ten
years
of
experience,
justice
breyer,
under
the
statute,
and
we
haven't
seen
those
things
being
chilled.
indeed,
respondents--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--last
year
in
united
states
v.
williams,
an
opinion
that
virtually
every
member
of
this
court
joined,
including
you,
justice
kennedy,
this
court
said
that
it
would
look
to
the
experience,
the
post-ferber
experience,
in
prosecuting
cases
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
--
two
terms
in
the
statute,
"promotes"
and
"presents",
were
vague
and
would
raise
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
actually,
justice
kennedy,
the
reason
that
came
up
in
the
case
is
because
there
were
hypotheticals
being
advanced
such
as
police
--
a
man
who
wants
to
call
the
police
that
says
that
child
pornography
arrived
in
my
--
in
the
mail
and
so
on.
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
even
though
the
words
in
the
statute,
just
as
the
words
in
this
statute,
could
be
read
broadly
or
narrowly--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
do
think
that
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
do
think
that
the
exceptions
clause
does
some
of
the
constitutional
work
to
exclude
some
of
the
hypotheticals
like
bullfighting
and
the
like.
we
do
think
the
statute
itself
has
a
number
of
restrictions
built
into
it
on
its
face
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--dogfighting
and
cockfighting
are
illegal
in
all
50
states
and
therefore
would
be
swept
up.
some
certain
depictions
of
dogfighting
and
cockfighting
would
be
swept
up,
not
all.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
may
or
may
not
be.
there
aren't,
at
least,
specific
statutes
generally
dealing
with
it,
but--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--okay.
so--
[laughter]
in
hunting,
as
well
as--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
let
me
just,
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
not
all
dogfighting
videos
are
swept
up
by
section
48.
there
may
be
educational
videos,
along
the
lines
that
justice
sotomayor
said,
raised
which
are
not
swept
up.
bullfighting
is
the
same
basic
thing.
it's
not
that
there
is
a
categorical
--
a
categorical
exemption
on
bullfighting;
it
is
rather
that
there
are
certain
ones
that
are
educational
and
not,
just
like
in
child
pornography.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
if
it
meets
the
other
terms
in
the
statute,
right.
so
commercial
and
things
like
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
now,
with
respect
to
hunting,
hunting
is
generally
not
considered
animal
cruelty.
and
it
doesn't--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
correct.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
something
that
resembles
the
terms
of
the
statute,
the
language
of
which
is
"maimed,
mutilated,
tortured,
wounded,
or
killed--
"
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--yes,
sir,
your
honor.
i
do.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
the
decision
you
wrote
last
year
in
united
states
v.
williams,
which
interprets
the
words
"promotes
and
presents",
which
you
yourself
in
the
opinion
said
are
capable
of
a
wide
variety
of
meanings.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
--
and
here
the
word
"kill"
in
context
is
a
term
that
the
statute--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it
means
killed
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
is
defining
the
words
"animal
cruelty",
and
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
the
definition
that
is
being
defined
by
the
legislature--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
the
legislature
under
no
way,
shape,
or
form
was
targeting
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
think
that
it
basically
did
say
that
by
using
the
words
"animal
cruelty"
in
the
statute.
now,
if
there's
a
disagreement
about
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
scalia,
in
leocal,
this
court
defined
the
term
ina
had
--
that
the
ina
interpreted
wrongly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
it
could
have
been
done
in
williams.
it
could
have
been
done
in
the
child
pornography
cases,
which
also
have
vague
terms.
but
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
using
the
substantial
overbreadth
doctrine
to
do
that
leaves
gaping
holes
in
place.
if
we
followed
your
invitation,
justice
breyer,
we
would
leave
crush
videos
unprotected.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
here
i
think
we
should
give
congress
some
credit,
because
what
it
actually
did
in
the
exemption
clause
was
borrow
this
court's
own
jurisprudence
from
the
obscenity
context
on
exceptions
like
literary,
artistic,
political
and
scientific.
it
had
found
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
complicated
because
congress
would
have
to
find
that
by
targeting
the
underlying
videos
but
leaving
alternative
simulated
mugging
videos
in
place,
somehow
it
would
have
reduced
the
market
for
muggings
or
something
like
that.
i
think
that's
very
hard.
and
it
goes
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
whether
this
statute
is
aimed
at
the
communicative
of
impact,
which
we
don't
think
it
is,
or
it
is
aimed
at
just
reducing
the
first
order
problem
which
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
dog
fighting
is
illegal
in
all
50
states
along
with
crush
videos.
i
don't
think
that
--
there
may
be--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right.
this
court
has
dealt
with
that
in
footnote
19
of
ferber
in
which
it
said
that
just
because
something
is
legal
somewhere
else,
it's
often
very
hard
to
figure
out
where
the
underlying
material
is
made.
it
doesn't
have
a
gps
component.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
this
is
--
i'm
sorry
if
i'm
not
following
the
hypothetical.
this
is
historical--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
it
sounds
like
it
would
fall
under
the
historical
exemption,
at
least
in
the
hypothetical
as
you
have
raised
it.
so,
it
wouldn't
be
prohibited
by
section
48--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
there
again,
it
would
raise
some
first
amendment
interest
in
suppressing
historical
--
historical
information.
now,
justice
scalia,
you
said
who
knows.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
this
statute
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
prove
that
there
is
no
historical
or
educational
value.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
i
do
think
that
is
the
court's
own
jurisprudence
with
respect
to,
for
example,
obscenity
and
child
pornography,
both
of
which
this
court
has
accepted
precisely
those
types
of
exceptions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
actually
read
child
pornography
to
be
obscenity.
the
rationale
of
ferber--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
first
mr.
stevens,
of
course,
even
in
the
japan
videos
you
mentioned,
he
sent
his
dogs
to
japan
to
--
to
fight.
and
this
statute
encompasses
real
time
transmissions
of--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it
was,
just
--
again,
like
child
pornography
and
the
like.
the
second--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
agree
with
that.
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
underlay
either
this
court's
ferber
decision
or
the
free
speech
coalition.
the
move
that
ferber
makes
is
to
say
that
the
legislature
can
target
the
underlying
loaded
production,
so
long
as
it
leaves
alternative
mechanisms
for
that
same
exact
message
to
be
spoken.
and
this
statute
does
that.
mr.
stevens
can
produce
the
exact
same
message,
just
as
long
as
he
doesn't
involve
the
torture
or
mutilation
to
an
actual
living
animal.
and
to
compare
this--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
congress
hasn't
stamped
that
out.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
with
simulated
messages,
the
written
word.
he
has
written
an
entire
book
about
that.
he
has
a
whole
variety--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--simulate
--
absolutely.
this
statute
leaves
that
in
place,
justice
scalia.
that's
the
key
to
understanding
why
this
statute
is
not
like
the
traditional
statutes
that
come
before
this
court
in
which
the
government
asserts
some
paternalistic
interest
and
says
viewers
can't
see
this
because
of
the
offense
of
the
message.
this
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
offense
of
the
message.
it
has
to
do
with
trying
to
dry
up
an
underlying
market
for
animal
cruelty.
if
the
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
there
is
one
analytic
move
congress
made
in
section
48,
which
is
simple
and
obvious,
and
it
explains
why
both
the
human
sacrifice
channel
is
constitutional,
as
well
as
section
48
itself.
that
is
the
logic
of
ferber.
when
congress
tries
to
dry
up
a
market
for
underlying
cruelty
by
targeting
depictions
and
leaves
alternative
mechanisms
for
that
expression
in
place,
the
legislature
has
latitude.
when
the
statute
is
not
aimed
at
the
communicative
impact
of
the
message,
like
the
hitler
video,
but,
rather,
is
aimed
at
reducing
underlying
acts
of
exploitation,
that
is
an
area
which
congress
has
great
leeway.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i'm
saying
that,
if
congress
identified
a
market
and
if
a
video
--
if
the
snuff
video
market
was
driving,
somehow,
people
to
get
killed,
congress
would
be
fully
within
its
power
to
regulate
it.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
precisely
correct,
but,
here,
congress
did
find
an
overwhelming
market
in
animal
cruelty,
and
the
state
attorney's
general
that
filed
a
brief
before
you
saying
that
section
48
is
a
success
story,
that
it
dried
up
3,000
crush
videos,
that
it
has
reduced
the
market
for
animal--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--there
--
there
haven't
been
any
prosecutions
for
crush
videos,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
because
the
market
dried
up
very
quickly
after
the
enactment
of
section
48.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
oh,
no.
if
there
is
an
underlying
argument--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
that
does
start
to
reach
into
questions
about
obscenity
and
expressive
impact
on
viewers,
which
is
not
before
this
court.
congress
is
not
resting
its
judgment
here
on
something
saying
these
images
are
repulsive
and
can't
be
seen.
rather,
it
is
saying--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--again,
that
raises
a
whole
different
set
of
questions
under
obscenity
and
expressive
impact
that
isn't
before
the
court
here.
now,
if
i
could
return
to,
justice
stevens,
you
had
he
wasn't
clear
on
the
position
on
hunting.
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this.
hunting,
like
the
other
hypotheticals,
is
not
covered
by
section
48
for
two
reasons:
first,
the
statute
--
the
statute's
term
"animal
cruelty"
should
be
defined
to
encompass
torture,
mutilation
and
the
like,
and
not
simple
acts
of
ordinary
hunting,
most
of
which,
by
the
way,
are
legal
anyway
under
animal
cruelty.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
again--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
again,
justice
scalia,
as
i
said
before,
i
think
that
comes
within
a
definition
of
animal
cruelty.
that's
the
term
being
defined.
and
just
as
this
court
has
defined,
for
example,
crimes
of
violence
to
exclude
certain
things
that
otherwise
would
be
within
the
statute,
such
as
drunk
driving
offenses
in
the
context
of
the
ima,
a
similar
result
is
possible
here,
particularly
because
of
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
avoidance.
and,
so,
we
are
saying
that
if
this
court
were
to
write
an
opinion
that
made
clear
that
these
things
are
outside
of
the
purview
of
section
48,
there
would
be
no
chilling
effect,
and
you
wouldn't
have
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it
would
have
to
be
for
a
reason
of
animal
cruelty
or
something
like
torture,
mutilation
and
the
like.
so
there
may
be
certain
hunting
examples
that
fall
within
it--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
motive,
it
has
to
do
with
what
happens
to
the
animal.
and,
so,
there
could
be
images
of
hunting
which
are
not
really
hunting,
like
the
images
in
this
case.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
the
images
in
this
case
and
what
congress
was
getting
at
was
not
shooting
a
little
low.
these
are
the
most
horrific
images
that
you
can
imagine
of
cruelty
to
living
animals.
and
that's
what
congress--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
my
point
if
those
--
if
there
are
those
cases
at
the
area
--
at
the
gray
areas,
that
is
perfect
for
as
applied
challenge,
but
it's
not
what
this
court
--
this
court
shouldn't
be
blessing
the
third
circuit's
decision
to
in
toto
invalidate
an
entire
statute
which
has
produced
--
which
has
produced
3,000
crush
videos
and
the
like.
