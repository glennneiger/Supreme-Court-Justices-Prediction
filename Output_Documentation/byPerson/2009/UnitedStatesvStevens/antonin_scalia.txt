justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
a
"for-profit
commercial
market"?
you
mean
anything
that
is
sold,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
it
is.
i
mean,
you
can't
separate
the
means
from
the
end
and
say,
since
its
end
is
simply
to
prevent
the
--
the
activity,
the
means,
which
is
to
prevent
the
communication,
is
okay.
it
is
targeting
the
communication
of
videos
that
depict
this
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
child
--
child
pornography
is
obscenity
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
and
it
has
been
treated
as
part
of
that
same
traditional
classification
which
there
has
always
been
permission
for
the
government
to
prohibit.
this
is
something
quite
different.
i
mean,
you
know,
what
if
--
what
if
i
--
i
am
an
aficionado
of
bullfights
and
i
think,
contrary
to
the
animal
cruelty
people,
i
think
it
--
they
enoble
both
beast
and
man,
and
i
want
to
persuade
people
that
bullfights
are
terrific
and
we
should
have
them.
i
would
--
i
would
not
be
able
to
--
to
market
videos
showing
people
how
exciting
a
bullfight
is.
right?
i
would
be
able
to
talk
and
say,
oh,
you
should
really
allow
bullfights,
but
i
cannot
make
the
most
significant
point
that
i
want
to
make,
get
people
to
watch
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
wait.
i
don't
understand
that.
any
depiction
of
bullfighting
is
educational?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
true
because
congress
said
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
a
dogfight
is
educational,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
noneducational
bullfighting
would
be
prohibited?
if
i
market
this
just
because
i
think,
boy,
bullfighting
is
really
exciting?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
it
is
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
"or
killed".
how
do
you
limit
"killed"
to
cruel
--
you
say
in
your
brief
that
it's
noscitur
ex
sociis.
but
that's
a
doctrine
that
says
when
you
have
a
string
of
words,
one
of
which
has
various
meanings,
which
meaning
it
has
depends
upon
the
words
with
which
it
is
associated.
so
if
you
speak
of
staples,
staples
--
what,
thumb
tacks,
nails,
and
other
fasteners,
"nails"
obviously
doesn't
mean
toenails.
it
means
a
nail
that
is
a
fastener,
the
word
"nail"
having
various
meanings.
"kill"
has
one
meaning,
which
is
kill.
and
you
can
--
you
cannot
limit
that
meaning
just
because
in
addition
to
killing
you
also
prohibit
torturing
and
other
things.
do
you
have
a
single
case
where
--
where
that
doctrine
is
used
not
to
give
meaning
to
an
ambiguous
word,
but
to
limit
the
meaning
of
a
word
which
on
its
face
is
absolutely
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it's
not
susceptible
to
a
wide
--
that's
my
whole
point.
it
means
kill.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
people
think
eating
an
animal
is
animal
cruelty.
these
people
don't
eat
meat
because
it
is
the
product
of
killing
animals.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
shouldn't
have
said
that,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
a
single
case
in
which
a
--
an
absolutely
clear
word
like
"kill"
is
given
a
more
narrow
meaning
because
of
other
words
that
are
different
from
that
word.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
first
order
problem
occurs
in
states
where
it
is
not
illegal.
these
videos
are
taken
in
states
where
bullfighting
or
dog
fighting
or
cock
fighting
is
entirely
legal.
so,
i
don't
know
how
you
distinguish
a
--
a
movie
which
many
people
think
that
violence
in
movie
brutalizes
people
and
causes
violence
in
people's
action.
why
couldn't
congress,
persuaded
by
these
people
say,
you
know,
you
can't
have
--
cannot
depict
torture?
you
know,
these
horror
films
that
come
out
around
halloween,
you
can't
depict
that
anymore.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
what
you
have
done
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
knows.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
dress
up
like
an
ancient
roman,
the
whole
thing
is
of
historical
interest?
[laughter]
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
different
category.
that
is
traditional
first
amendment
law
that
obscenity
is
not
protected.
and
child
pornography,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
and
i
think
as
far
as
the
court
is
concerned
is
obscenity.
justice
antonin
scalia
his
message
is
that
getting
animals
to
fight
is
fun.
that's
his
message.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
he
--
you
know,
he
can
convey
that
message
in
some
other
way,
how
else
does
he
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
simulated
dog
fights
would
be
okay
under
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
requires?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
such
an
unusual
word.
i
haven't
heard
it
in
a
legal
argument
in
a
long
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
not
significant
value;
significant
artistic,
educational.
what
are
the
others?
scientific?
justice
antonin
scalia
strictly
entertainment
value
doesn't
count,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
most
of
the
hunting
videos
i
have
seen
people
watch
for
the
entertainment.
they
like
to
see
a
hunt.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
be
that
the
reason
hunting
videos
are
still
out
there
is
that
the
producers
were
quite
confident
that
this
court
would
not
allow
them
to
be
prohibited
on
the
base
of
a
statute
such
as
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
think
you
should
focus,
ms.
millett,
not
on
the
educational
value
for
--
to
make
people
hate
bull
fighting
and
things,
but
on
quite
the
opposite,
it
seems
to
me.
on
the
right
under
the
first
amendment
of
people
who
like
bull
fighting,
who
like
dog
fighting,
who
like
cock
fighting,
to
present
their
side
of
--
of
the
debate.
and
unless
it's
a
subject
like
obscenity,
which
from
the
beginning
has
not
been
considered
protected
speech,
it
seems
to
me
that
side
of
the
debate
is
entitled
to
make
its
point
as
--
as
forcefully
as
possible.
that's
it
seems
to
me
what
the
problem
is
here.
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
create
a
lot
of
first
amendment
horribles.
what
about
--
what
about
a
new
adolf
hitler?
can
we
censor
any
depiction
of
that
new
adolf
hitler
and
the
horrible
things
that
he
is
proposing,
including
extermination
of
a
race?
is
that
proscribable
under
the
first
amendment?
is
that
any
less
horrible
than
the
human
sacrifice
contemplation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought
that
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
comment
about
catering
to
people's
worst
instincts
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment,
at
least,
would
have
been
that
it's
not
up
to
the
government
to
decide
what
are
people's
worst
instincts.
if
--
if
the
first
amendment
means
anything,
that's
what
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
up
to
the
government
to
tell
us
what
our
worst
instincts
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
for
those
areas
that
have
traditionally
been
outside
the
area
of
--
of
protected
speech,
and
--
and
once
you
allow
this
one,
what
other
--
what
other
base
instincts
do
people
have,
besides
this
one?
one
can
contemplate
a
lot
of
other
areas,
where
government
could
say,
you
are
appealing
to
people's
worst
instincts,
and,
therefore,
the
--
the
movies
cannot
be
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
adolf
hitler,
can
we
keep
him
off
the
screen,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
are
you
saying,
since
there
is
no
human
sacrifice
in
this
country
and
no
market
to
be
dried
up,
the
videos
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah;
but
we
don't
have
any
human
sacrifice.
nobody's
doing
that
stuff.
so
you
could
not
proscribe
the
human
sacrifice
channel.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
the
statute's
term,
"kill"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
should
that
be
interpreted
to
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
shoot
a
little
low
and
wound
the
animal,
that
is
cruelty
even
though
you
didn't
intend
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
about
your
response
to
justice
stevens
on
the
hunting
matter?
i
understand
congress
wasn't
directed
at--
