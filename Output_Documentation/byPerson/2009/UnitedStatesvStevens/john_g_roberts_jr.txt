chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear,
first,
this
morning,
case
08-769,
united
states
v.
stevens.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
would
you
--
if
you
could
do
it
in
one
sentence,
what
is
your
test
for
determining
which
categories
of
speech
are
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
to
say
that
they
are
not
concerned
with
the
content,
i
--
i
think
is
contradicted
by
the
exceptions.
you
have
to
look
at
the
content
and
make
a
decision,
is
this
bona
fide
scientific,
journalistic,
educational,
historical?
so
you
have
to
look
at
the
content
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
speech
is
prohibited.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
you
tell
these
aren't
political
videos?
you
do
have,
with
organizations,
peta
and
others,
depictions
of
the
same
sort
of
animal
cruelty
that
is
used
to
generate
support
for
efforts
to
prohibit
it.
why
aren't
these
videos
the
exact
opposite,
you
know,
efforts
to
legalize
it,
and,
in
each
case,
it
would
fall
under
the
political
exemption?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
would
this
--
would
a
statute
like
this
apply
to
humans
be
constitutional?
you
can't
depict
videos
of,
say,
violent
muggings
or
things
of
that
sort?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
think
--
i
think
ferber
analytically
is
the
hard
case
for
you,
because
the
court
in
ferber
did
said
--
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
763:
"the
evil
to
be
restricted
so
overwhelmingly
outweighs
the
expressive
interest
at
stake.
"
that
was
their
articulation
of
the
test.
now,
why
shouldn't
we
apply
that
test
to
this
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
but
this
definition
or
these
exceptions
are
not
drawn
out
of
thin
air.
they
are
drawn
from
miller,
and
the
court
in
miller
recognized
that
they
were
significant
in
causing
the
restriction
of
obscenity
to
pass
constitutional
muster.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
understood
your
answers
to
justice
alito
to
acknowledge
that
there
would
be
situations
where
this
statute
could
be
constitutionally
applied,
or
as
you
put
it,
you
could
draft
a
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
this
statute.
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
if
in
fact
there
were
situations
where
we
thought
a
narrowly
drafted
statute
could
be
applied
to
particular
instances,
perhaps
the
crush
videos,
perhaps
others,
why
isn't
that
enough
to
say
that
this
statute
is
valid
on
its
face
and
then
we
will
consider
as-applied
challenges?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i
am
just
trying
to
get
at
what
your
understanding
of
what
the
test
is
for
overbreadth
in
this
area.
how
much
of
an
area
of
constitutional
application
is
necessary
before
you
decide
that
a
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
will
consider
as-applied
challenges?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry;
you
agree
you
can
prohibit
it,
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i'm
sorry.
i'm
still
looking
for
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
hypotheticals.
can
congress
ban
the
human
sacrifice
channel
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
unwilling
--
you
are
unwilling
to
say
that
congress
can
pass
a
law,
even-handed,
straightforward,
you
cannot
have
a
human
sacrifice
channel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
don't
like
--
we
don't
like
human
sacrifice,
and
so
congress
passes
a
law
saying
you
cannot
have
a
channel
that
shows
human
sacrifice
--
real
human
sacrifice.
you
think
that
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
right,
but,
i
mean,
the
hypothetical
is
we
can't
do
anything
about
it.
it
is
beyond
our
reach
to
stop
the
human
sacrifice
taking
place
wherever
in
the
world,
so
that
that
argument
--
the
ferber
argument
is
off
the
table.
in
that
situation,
you
think
it's
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
pass
a
law
saying
there
can
be
no
human
sacrifice
channel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katyal,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
i
just
understand
you
to
agree
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side,
that
congress
could
not
ban
the
human
sacrifice
channel
because
there
would
be
no
connection
between
drying
up
the
underlying
activity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i'm
saying
there
is
no
connection.
we
can't
reach
the
activity
where
it
is
taking
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
congress
is
--
and
we
will
give
you
sufficient
rebuttal
time.
so,
if
congress
is
saying,
look,
we
just
don't
like
what
--
is
being
shown
on
the
human
sacrifice
channel,
we
don't
want
people
to
see
it,
they
can't
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
both
counsel,
for
very
able
presentation.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-769,
stolt-nielsen
versus
animal
feeds
international.
