justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
i
made--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
look
what
you
have
done,
and
this
is
what
is
bothering
me.
you
take
these
words,
which
are
a
little
vague,
some
of
them,
"serious
religious,
political,
scientific,
educational,
journalistic,
historical,
or
artistic
value.
"
and
you
say
that's
a
standard
that
a
judge
or
prosecutor
will
apply.
and
people
have
to
understand
it
because
they
have
to
know
what
to
do
to
avoid
the
risk
of
being
prosecuted.
now,
as
i
have
gotten
out
of
these
briefs,
you
then
require
people
to
apply
that
standard,
not
simply
to
the
crush
videos
or
to
the
dogfighting,
but
also
to,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
bullfighting,
sheep
hunting,
bear
hunting,
deer
hunting,
fox
hunting,
humane
slaughter,
and
for,
i
think
somewhere
i
found,
the
stuffing
geese
for
pate
de
fois
gras.
all
right,
so
there
is
a
whole
long
--
quail
hunting.
there's
a
whole
long
list
in
here
of
things
that
people
might
want
to
do.
they
won't
know
if
it
falls
within
this
exemption.
nobody
in
every
state
wants
to
forbid
these
things.
sometimes
they
are,
sometimes
they
are
not.
they
won't
know
whether
or
not
they
can
make
this
particular
film,
picture,
or
other.
that's
the
overbreadth
argument.
and
i
would
like
to
hear
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
want
to
say
"cruelly
kill"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
"cruelly
kill"
is
not
exactly
crystal
clear.
and
therefore
my
question
is
why,
given
the
need
for
you
to
save
this
statute
to
read
so
many
words
that
are
so
general,
those
contained
here
that
i've
read,
cruelly
kill,
cruelly
wound
as
opposed
to
just
wound
or
kill.
you
are
doing
that
in
order
to
prevent
chilling
people
who
are
engaging
in
activities
that
aren't
intended
to
be
covered
by
this
statute.
why
not
do
a
simpler
thing?
rather
than
let
the
public
guess
as
to
what
these
words
mean,
ask
congress
to
write
a
statute
that
actually
aims
at
those
frightful
things
that
it
was
trying
to
prohibit.
now,
that
can
be
done.
i
don't
know
why
they
couldn't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
you
say
a
crush
video,
my
description
that
i
read
of
it,
you
would
have
a
strong
case.
i'm
not
saying
you
would
win,
i
don't
have
to
decide
that.
but
you
have
a
very
strong
case.
so
you
say
to
congress,
write
a
statute
that
focuses
on
that.
you
are
worried
about
dog
fighting,
write
a
statute
that
focuses
on
that,
and
moreover,
talks
about
something
unlawful
in
every
state.
i
am
not
giving
congress
advice,
though
i
seem
to
be.
[laughter]
i'm
just
saying
why
--
why
can't
you
here
write
a
statute
that
does
not
force
the
courts
into
the
work
of
interpreting
these
very
vague
words
to
prevent
the
statute
from
being
held
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
point
--
the
point
i
guess
is
when
you
say
yes
to
this,
what
you
are
thinking
is
that,
just
as
real
obscenity
when
depicted
does
nothing
communicative
but
rather
appeals
to
the
instinct
of
lust,
so
congress
could
find
a
category
of
things
that
do
not
communicate,
but
appeal
to
the
instinct
of
sadism;
and
that
is
true
when
other
creatures
are
killed
for
the
pleasure
of
the
people
who
want
to
see
them
killed.
now,
that's
what
you
are
saying.
now
--
and
i
think
maybe
that's
true.
we
don't
have
to
decide
that,
perhaps.
but
the
government
says
that
is
this
statute,
that
is
this
statute
read
in
light
of
its
basic
intent,
and
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
interpret
it
so
as
it
achieves
that
objective.
and
you
say
that's
not
possible.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
what
--
i
think
what's
going
on
is
--
is
not
--
your
conflating
two
things.
one
is
you
are
trying
to
produce
education
about
something
that
has
no
communicative
value.
in
so
far
as
you
are
trying
to
make
an
argument
or
educate,
of
course,
it
is
protected,
but
the
government,
here,
is
saying
i
think
the
statute
is
intended
to
forbid
a
different
thing
entirely,
and
it's
hard
to
draw
a
line.
maybe
it's
impossible;
but
promoting
a
thing
which
communicates
nothing,
but
appeals
to
people's
worst
instinct,
that
is
not
to
advocate
it
or
not
to
advocate
it.
it
is
to
try
to
make
money
out
of
it,
and
that's
what
they
think,
i
believe,
the
statute
is
aimed
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
why
they
have
the
journalistic
exception.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
are
going
to
advertise
a
drug
that
is
known
to
kill
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
are
advertising--
