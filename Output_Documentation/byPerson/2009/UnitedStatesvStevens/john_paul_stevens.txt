what
about
hunting
with
a
bow
--
what
about
hunting
with
a
bow
and
arrow
out
of
season?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
hunting
with
a
bow
and
arrow,
and
some
depictions
of
hunting
are
pretty
--
are
pretty
gruesome.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
view
of
the
breadth
of
the
statute.
i
didn't
yet
really
get
an
answer
out
of
your
opponent.
do
you
think
the
statute
would
prohibit
depictions
of
hunting
if
it
involved
killing
in
the
district
of
columbia,
because
hunting
as
i
understand
it
is
not
allowed
in
the
district
of
columbia,
it's
prohibited.
does
that
mean
that
any
depictions
of
hunting
that
show
the
killing
and
cruelty
are
prohibited
by
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wait,
i
want
to
just
be
sure
i
understand
you.
even
if
the
hunting
depiction
is
very
offensive
and
cruel
and
all
the
rest,
and
that
the
cruelty
to
the
animal
using
bow
and
arrows
or
knives
or
something,
you
say
it's
not
--
and
even
if
it's
illegal
in
this
particular
jurisdiction,
you
say
the
statute
still
does
not
apply
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
hunting
would
never
qualify,
because
the
hunter's
motive
is
benign;
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
