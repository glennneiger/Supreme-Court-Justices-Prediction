what
record
do
you
have
of
that
fact?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
i
understand,
but
crush
videos
is
only
one
species
of
cruelty
to
animals.
what
evidence
was
there
that,
for
example,
dog
fighting
had
as
large
and
robust
a
market
or
that
hunting
videos
in
those
states
in
which
hunting
was
illegal
had
a
robust
market,
et
cetera?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
could
you
tell
me
what
the
difference
is
between
these
video
and
david
roma's
documentary
on
pit
bulls?
i
mean,
david
roma's
documentary
had
much,
much
more
footage
on
the
actual
animal
cruelty
than
the
films
at
issue
here,
greater
sections
of
the
film,
and
more
explicit.
in
this
film,
the
--
the
respondent
didn't
let
the
video
show
the
actual
tearing
of
the
jaw.
david
roma's
did
much
more
than
that,
showed
much
more
than
that.
so
isn't
--
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
judgment
inherent
in
this
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
not
in
child
pornography
because,
there,
congress
says
the
very
act
--
it
doesn't
matter
how
artistic
it
is.
that
very
act
of
child
pornography
is
illegal.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
mean
by
"even-handed",
please?
i'm
not
--
you
are
using
those
words.
what
do
you
mean
about
"even-handed
and
narrowly
tailored"?
