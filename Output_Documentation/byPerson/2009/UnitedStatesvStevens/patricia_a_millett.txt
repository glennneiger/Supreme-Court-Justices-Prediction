ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
not
the
exact
same
message,
if
you
are
forced
in
a
popular
debate
that
is
going
around
this
country
now
about
the
treatment
of
animals.
to
require
one
side
to
engage
--
to
use
simulated
images,
which
is
exactly
what
the
government's
reply
brief
at
page
3
insists
upon,
while
those
who
want
to
ban
conduct
are
allowed
to
use
real
images.
that
puts
the
government's
censorial
thumb
on
the
scale
of
public
debate.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
--
i
think
there's
a
--
that
a
properly
drawn
law
could
very
well,
at
least
in
my
humble
opinion,
this
court
would
have
to
decide,
survive
strict
scrutiny.
there
is
also,
i
suppose,
some
argument
whether
it
would
fit
into
--
you
wouldn't
need
strict
scrutiny,
you
would
fit
it
into
an
unprotected
category
of
speech
like
obscenity
or
it
would
be
the
production
issue
that
would
--
like
you
have
in
ferber.
but
what
--
beyond
that
i
do
think
we
need
to
keep
in
mind
a
couple
of
things--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
no.
i
think
--
i'm
saying
that
there
are
three
alternative
ways
in
which
to
get
to
it.
my
first
if
one
is
that
not
this
statute,
but
under
a
properly
drawn
statute--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
might
survive
scrutiny.
i'm
not
sure
you
would--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to,
say
this
statute,
because
i
don't
think
this
statute
--
but
if
the
statute
said,
this
--
i
think
this
court
disagree
--
it
disagrees
with
me
sometimes
--
but
i
think
this
could
pass
constitutional
muster.
a
statute
that
says
the
patently
offensive
intentional
torture
and
killing
of
an
animal
for
--
designed
to
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
for
the
purpose
of
producing
the
image,
i
think
that
would
satisfy
--
i
think
it
would
satisfy
strict
scrutiny.
the
court
might
also
decide
that
it's
close
enough
to
obscenity
or
it's
like
the
ferber
production
rationale.
that's
my
position;
there
are
sort
of
three
ways
it
could
be
analyzed,
a
statute
like
that.
that's
not
this
statute
and
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that
this
statute,
because
congress
has
the
authority
to
reach
something,
that
when
it
throws
a
blanket
net
as
wide
as
this
one
has
that
this
means
this
statute
is
the
mechanism,
a
lawful
mechanism
for
getting--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--a
properly
drawn
statute
with
the
requisite
congressional
findings
or
record
of
a
need
to
attack
--
it
sound
to
me
like
this
is
a
need
to
attack
production.
as
in
child
pornography,
the
fact
that
the
image
taking
is
legal
overseas
does
not
mean
that
it
can't
be
prohibited
here.
and
if
you
had
the
type
of
record
of
a
statute
that
says
we
want
to
stop
the
production;
it's
not
the
content,
it
is
the
production,
as
this
court
explained
in
free
speech
coalition
for
child
pornography.
but
that
is
a
statute
that
then
wouldn't
have
--
either
you
would
have
to
decide
which
things
are
in
and
out
--
if
you
started
saying
animal
cruelty
production,
but
we
we'll
let
the
bullfights
in
but
the
pitbull
fights
out
and
the
cock
fights,
then
you'd
have
problems--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
theory
--
i
mean,
ultimately
this
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
ferber
is
limited
to
an
obscenity
that's
historically
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
if
this
court
--
two
things.
it
would
have
to
be
a
very,
very
narrowly
drawn
statute,
i
think
going
to
the
production
theory
like
ferber;
and
the
question
i
think
before
this
court
would
be,
given
the
nature
of
the
harm
that
presumably
would
be
found,
the
nature
of
the
market,
the
synergistic
effect,
where
the
--
i
am
assuming
the
findings
here
would
be
that
the
crime
and
the
image
are
one
and
the
same,
inextricably
intertwined
--
then
maybe,
although
i
still
think
it
would
be
a
bit
harder
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
here.
we
don't
make
it
up
as
we
go
along.
at
the
time
that
the
first
amendment
was
written
dog-fighting
was
legal
in
this
country.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
two
things.
first
of
all,
there
is
interpreting
and
then
there
is
alchemy,
and
i
think
this
statute
requires
alchemy.
this
is
reno
versus--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--alchemy,
alchemy.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there's
construction
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--we
don't
often
get
statutes
that
are
so
far
off
base
that
we're
going,
i
think
in
my
opinion,
so
far
beyond
construing
ambiguity
and
doing
instead
what
was
asked
of
this
court
and
the
court
declined
in
reno
v.
aclu,
and
that
is
to
write
the
statute
for
congress.
the
ambiguity,
as,
justice
scalia,
you
explained
--
you
would
have
to
excise
this
statute
in
and
out,
sever
so
many
things.
i
don't
know
what
you'd
have
left
unless
it's
the
statute
i
posited
to
justice
alito,
which
might
have
a
couple
of
words
that
overlap
with
this
statute.
but
that
is
not
statutory
construction.
this
court's
job
is
not
to
write
the
statute
for
congress.
and
also
keep
in
mind,
in
the
past
this
court
consistently
under
the
first
amendment
has
required,
not
just
the
right
words,
but
a
record
from
congress.
in
the
first
amendment
area
we
can't
just
posit
the
problems;
we
have
to
really
have
confidence
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
there
is
not.
and
in
fact
they
spent
their
time,
as
we
said
in
our
brief
--
and
this
is
perfectly
accurate.
members
of
congress,
to
the
extent
they
discussed
other
things,
kept
saying
in
the
floor
debates:
that's
not
in;
bull-fighting's
not
in;
dog-fighting's
not
in;
hunting's
not
in;
these
things
are
not
in.
so
they
mentioned
them
in
the
context
of
saying
these
are
not
in.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
don't
think
that
is
a
legal
test
that
is
adopted
under
the
first
amendment.
i
think
that
is
a
description
of
the
types
of
categories
that
by
history
and
tradition
had
been
outside
the
first
amendment
and
the
rationale
for
why
ferber
came
in,
which
was,
yes,
there's
overlap,
but
i
think
it
actually
bridges
the
world
of
obscenity
and
virtual
incitement
because
you
have
the
crime
and
the
image
one
and
the
same
wrapped
up
together.
there
is
in
this
instance
--
there
are
about
five
different
ways
that
this
is
different
from
child
pornography.
the
first
is
that
there
has
never
been
any
finding,
any
assertion,
even
by
the
government,
that
creating
the
image
is
the
primary
or
sole
motive
for
creating
these
images.
it's
not
if
you
lock
mr.
stevens
up
--
if
you
throw
away
every
dog-fighting
video
in
the
country
tomorrow,
dog-fighting
will
continue.
it
--
no
one
thinks
that
it
will
go
away.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
you
don't
dry
up
the
market
by
having
a
sweeping
value
exception
like
they
have
here.
if
congress
wants
to
dry
up
the
market,
what
ferber
says
is
there's
two
things
that
have
to
happen:
one,
you've
got
to
prove
causation.
you
can't
simply
say,
we
got
a
problem,
let's
go
first
to
the
speech
and
cut
that
off
as
our
first
prosecutorial
tool
when
we
are
not
even
ready
to
make
the
crime
itself
a
felony,
but
we
will
make
the
speech
a
felony.
you've
got
to
prove
causation,
that
these
images
cause
the
harm,
they
are
one
and
the
same
with
the
harm
as
they
are
with
child
pornography.
you
also
have
got
to
prove
that
congress
is
acting
in
an
evenhanded
way.
it
is
not
leaving,
as
justice
scalia
said,
appreciable
damage
to
the
interests
that
its
asserting
uncovered
by
its
many,
many
exceptions--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
they
are
prohibited
subject
to
the
value
police
and
the
value
trial
like
we
had
here,
which
i
think
is
antithetical
to
the
first
amendment.
it's
a
very
different
rule
under
the
obscenity
statute.
so
it
would
all
depend
on
whether
a
jury
decided
that
that
had
serious
value,
which
was
defined
as
significant
and
great
import
in
this
particular
case.
that
would
decide
whether--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--scientific,
social,
artistic,
journalistic--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
it
does
not.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
that's
exactly
right
and
that's
what
the
safari
club
and
the
nra
have
told
us.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
first
of
all,
this
is
about
--
this
is
miller
doubled
--
there's
a
lot
more
here
--
categories
here.
but
it's
a
very
different
role
that
value
plays
under
miller
in
obscenity.
first
of
all,
this
court
made
quite
clear
again
in
reno
v.
aclu
that
miller
only
works
if
you
have
all
three
prongs.
you
can't
just
use
the
serious
value
prong
to
take
care
of
your
constitutional
problem.
second,
you
were
dealing
in
an
area
that
by
history
and
tradition
is
unprotected
speech.
milller--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
what
you
do
is
you
look
at
text
of
the
statute,
and
then
you
ask
yourself,
how
much
of
a
strain
is
it
to
come
up
with
a
factual
pattern
that
will
fit
into
it?
in
williams
you
had
to
first
of
all
read
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
at
some
level
congress
has
a
job
to
write
with
a
scalpel
and
not
a
buzz
saw
in
the
first
amendment
area,
and
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
happens
is
to
look
at
the
text
and
say,
does
this
text
fit
the
purpose,
does
it
fit
what
the
constitution
will
allow?
and
when
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
does
for
this
reason.
people
--
and
this
gets
a
little
bit
to
justice
kennedy's
vagueness
concern.
people
have
a
right
to
know
how
to
--
outside
the
courtroom
how
to
conform
their
conduct
to
the
law.
if
i
got
a
call
from
the
general
counsel
of
outdoor
channel
or
someone
making
hunting
videos
and
they
said,
"does
this
fall
within
this
statute.
"
i
wouldn't
have
to
come
up
with
a
strained
factual
scenario.
i
would
say
yeah,
it
falls
squarely
in,
subject
to
a
prosecutor
or
jury
anywhere
where
you
market
in
this
country,
deciding
that
it
has
serious
--
one
of
the
adjectives
--
value.
i
would
have
to
say
that
to
that
person,
and
that
would
be
accurate
legal
advice.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
one
would
hope,
and
i
think
quite
frankly
the
nra
has
been
quite
honest
in
it's
brief
and
said
you
know,
this
--
this
is
not
an
actively
enforced
statute.
people
were
shocked
to
learn
--
to
become
aware
of
it.
now
maybe
everyone's
supposed
to
know
the
existence
of
laws,
but
i
think
the
reality
is
that
once
people
looked
at
what
this
said,
they
became
very,
very,
very
concerned,
and
i
think
when
you're
talking
about
a
criminal
prohibition
here
--
this
is
not
a
civil
suit,
this
is
criminal
prohibition
with
severe
penalties.
the
penalties
for
speech
are
higher
than
most
animal
cruelty
statutes.
and
the
whole
point
of
the
criminal
law
is
to
deter
conduct
and
to
make
people
stay
wide
of
the
margins
here,
wide
of
the
borders.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
you
can't
do
that
in
the
first
amendment.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
not
this
statute.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
different.
i
think
that's
very
different.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
in
the
first
amendment
--
i'm
not
talking
--
if
i
heard
you
right
we
were
not
talking
about
this
statute.
if
you
have
another
statute--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
and
this
court
has
been
clear
that
the
overbreadth
has
to
be
both
quantitative
and
qualitative.
it
hasn't
set
a
particular
ratio.
i
think
this
one
is
easy.
we
are
talking
about
2,000
crush
videos
and
tens
if
not
hundreds
of
thousands
of
other
images
that
are
captured
by
this
statute.
i
think
normally
when
this
court
says
it
wants
to
--
to
apply
overbreadth,
it
has
been
dealing
with
situations
for
the
most
part
in
two
contexts.
one
where
congress
has
already
regulated
in
an
area
that
is
unprotected
under
the
first
amendment,
unprotected
in
the
sense
that
they
are
allowed
to
ban,
regulate
heavily.
they
are
already
there,
and
the
question
is
did
they
draw
the
margins
too
broad?
that
is
not
this
case.
we
are
dealing
in
an
area
that
was
never
until
december
1999
barred
by
anybody,
never
considered
to
be
outside
the
conception
of
the
first
amendment's
freedom
of
speech.
the
other
scenario
where
we
see
substantial
overbreadth
is
when
congress
is
regulating
conduct.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
this
covers
photographs,
so
this
would
go
back
as
far
as
photographs.
i'm
not
sure
it
wouldn't
cover
a
sketch
artist
or
a
hieroglyphic,
for
all
i
know.
all
it
requires
is
that
it
be
a
depiction
in
some
form.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
market--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--with
respect,
i
can't
answer
that.
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
if
there
is
a
market
for
dog
fighting
videos.
there
is
a
few,
but
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
a
market.
will
somebody
buy
something?
i
guess
somebody
in
this
world
will
buy
anything.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--none
whatsoever,
and
in
fact
what
we've
seen
is
robust
enforcement,
and
we
cite
the
article
in
our
case,
we
have
seen
robust
enforcement;
there
was
just
an
arrest
a
few
weeks
ago
for
i
think
a
couple
hundred
people
involved
in
dog
fighting
rings.
so
the
dog
fighting
rings
are
going
on
unabated
and
they
are
getting
found
and
discovered
and
prosecuted
successfully,
and
in
fact
the
images
sometimes
help
with
the
prosecution.
this
is
a
place,
when
we
start
talking
we
are
going
to
take
something
outside
the
first
amendment,
one
of
the
other
things
that
unifies
the
categories
of
speech
outside
the
first
amendment
is
a
judgment
that
more
speech
doesn't
work.
this
is
an
area
where
we
know
speech
works
powerfully.
speech
about
these
ugly
images
produced
this
statute.
it
informed
people.
unlike
children
and
child
pornography,
people
need
to
see
images
to
understand
what's
going
on
with
animals,
and
to
make
these
important
decisions
and
engage
in
these
important
debates
that
our
society
is
having.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
--
i
agree.
i--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
no,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
--
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
this
is
in
fact
a
contrast.
first
of
all
--
a
contrast
between
the
two
situations
between
dealing
with
the
subject,
a
very
topical
subject
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
that
is
100
percent
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
problem
with
this
statute
is
that
presumably
that
statute
would
be
even-handed
and
would
it
not
say
if
the
sacrifices
were
religious,
or
journalistic,
or
historic.
or--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
justice
scalia.
again,
i
agree,
because
what
the
first
amendment
says
is
we
allow--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
agree
that,
just
because
something
is
repulsive,
incredibly
offensive
or
maybe
even
involves
some
harm
to
people
does
not
mean
that
--
depictions
of
it
that
do
not
cause
that
harm,
that
are
not
integrally
tied
to
it,
that
are
not
the
purpose
and
animating
motivation
for
that
harm
cannot
be
proscribed.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
--
if
--
at
a
minimum,
congress
has
got
to
be
evenhanded.
the
point
there
is
that
you
are
trying
to
say
we
are
concerned
about
the
creation
for
purposes
of
the
image.
we
are
concerned
about
what
the
government
calls
the
"snuff
video
situation".
this
whole
reason
that
this
is
created
is
for
purposes
of
creating
the
image.
if
you
establish
the
causation
--
and
i
don't
think
we
--
the
court
does
just
defer
to
congress
on
these
things.
it
looks
carefully
at
factual
records
in
--
as
it
has
in
the
child
pornography
are
under
the
first
amendment,
justice
kennedy.
if
congress
proves
the
causation
and
shows
that
it
is
--
it's
the
least
restrictive
means
--
compelling
and
least
restrictive
means,
the
strict
scrutiny
that
congress
--
the
government
never
wanted
this
statute
to
march
through.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
--
the
fact
that
conduct
is
repulsive
or
offensive
does
not
mean
we
automatically
ban
the
speech.
you
would
have
to
have
--
it
would
have
to
follow
this
court's
patterns,
either
it
would
be
an
even-handed
ban
on
production,
under
the
ferber
theory,
or
you
would
have
to
establish
that
those
images
were
never
within
the
constraints--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
--
when
it
comes
to
promoting
illegal
conduct,
we
have
the
brandenburg
test,
and,
if
you
are
close
enough
to
be
inciting
it,
to
be
causing
it
--
which
i
think
is
where
ferber,
largely,
is.
they
are
just
intertwined.
that's
one
thing.
but
if
it's
not
--
just
because
we
have
the
really
disgusting,
despicable
channel
doesn't
mean
that
we
automatically
ban
it.
maybe
it
will
be
educational.
maybe
we
will
learn
from
it.
i
think
congress
is
going
to
have
to
show,
before
it
goes
to
speech
as
its
first
tool
of
repression
to
attack
conduct
with,
very
specialized,
narrow
circumstances--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
is
commercial--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
is
commercial
speech.
the
fact
that
you
want
to
get
paid
for
speaking
does
not
make
it
commercial
speech.
samuel
johnson,
himself,
said
that
no
one
but
a
blockhead
ever
wrote,
except
for
money.
i
don't
necessarily
agree
with
that,
but
it
is
--
it
would
be
a
shock
to
him,
to
thomas
payne,
who
sold
his
tracks
of
"common
sense",
that
the
first
amendment
would
go
all
--
leap
all
the
way
from
commercial
speech
and
say,
just
because
you
are
doing
it
for
money,
you
need
to
make
a
buck.
your
honor--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
it
means--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
means--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
agree,
justice
scalia.
the
answer
to
that
instance
is
more
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
the
answer--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
--
the
--
i
think
--
i
--
i
will
start
by
saying
--
no.
let's
start
with
that
and
see.
maybe
--
maybe
it
won't
work,
but
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
it
did,
it
would
have
to
be
even-handed
and
have
narrow
tailoring,
but
the
problem
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--when
--
when
the
attack
--
justice
sotomayor,
when
the
attack
is
on
the
production
--
if
it
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
i
want
to
be
direct
in
answering.
it
depends
on
two
things.
if
the
theory
is
we
don't
like
the
content,
we
don't
want
people
to
see
the
content,
i
don't
think
congress
can
do
it.
i
think
the
answer
is
more--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no
one
has
ever
found
one,
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
get
--
there
are
two
theories--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
a
dangerous
proposition.
that's
what
the
first
amendment
says
we
won't
do.
there
is
--
so
if
it's
just
that
we
don't
like
the
content,
outside
obscenity,
we
--
congress
doesn't
get
to
ban
it.
the
answer
is
more
speech.
if
you
have
got--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think,
if
the
point
is
that
we
don't
like
the
could
content,
we
don't
--
we
want
to
protect
people
from
these
images,
the
first
amendment
says
a
lot
about
that.
if
it's
a
different
--
snuff
video,
because,
like
child
pornography,
like
i
said,
it's
not
the
content
that
we
are
concerned
about,
where
obscenity
is
a
pure
content
baseline.
it
is
--
we
got
to
stop
--
we
can't
stop
the
conduct.
the
conduct
and
the
speech
are
inextricably
intertwined.
the
only
way
we
can
stop
human
sacrifice
is
to
stop
the
image
because
the
sacrifice
is
solely
for
the
image.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
--
i
think
the
fact
that
--
i
think
it
would
be
a
lot
harder
under
the
first
amendment
to
say
why
congress
is
doing
that.
if
it's
not
something
--
if
it's
not
conduct
it
has
any
authority
to
regulate,
i
don't
--
then
the
only
compelling
interest
is
--
i'm
trying
--
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
watch
this
channel,
and
people
should
fight
with
their
wallets
and
their
votes
and
not
support
these
things,
but
--
i'm
sorry.
may
i
finish?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but,
under
the
first
amendment,
if
the
only
rationale
congress
is
giving
is
we
are
here
to
shield
your
eyes
for
you,
we
will
make
this
censorial
decision,
it
has
got
to
find
some
basis
to
think
that
was
never
freedom
of
the
speech
under
the
first
amendment,
in
the
way
that
obscenity
was.
you
don't
get
to
make
it
up
as
you
go
along.
we
are
interpreting
a
constitution.
