justice

bader

mr.
katyal,
the
court
summarily
dealt
with
a
case
some
years
ago,
american
booksellers
v.
hudnut,
where
cities
attempted
to
make
not
even
a
criminal
offense,
but
the
subject
of
a
civil
suit,
a
violent
depiction
--
depictions
of
women
as
sexual
objects
enjoying
pain
and
humiliation
and
degradation.
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
that
was
a
blatant
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
to
go
after
purveyors
who
show
these
women
in
the
shocking,
degrading
photographs,
and
i
believe
we
summarily
affirmed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
a
--
what
is
"and
the
like"?
how
about
cockfighting?
what
is
the
difference
between
--
perhaps
i
missed
something
a
few
moments
ago
--
between
bullfighting,
cockfighting,
dogfighting?
you
say
dogfighting
is
included,
but
bullfighting
--
and
i
don't
know
where
you
put
cockfighting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
bullfighting?
isn't
that
illegal
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
we
--
have
we
finished
with
the
category
of
fights?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
--
illegal
in
japan,
and
part
of
the
video
here
were
dog
fights
in
japan;
legal
where
it
occurred,
no
different
from
bull
fighting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
katyal,
there
is
something
quite
different
between
ferber,
because
the
abuse
of
a
child
is
occurring
at
the
very
time.
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
stevens
was
not
a
promoter
of
dog
fights.
he
was
just
filming
them.
and
so
the
--
the
--
the
simultaneous
abuse
of
the
child,
it
occurs
only
because
the
picture
is
being
taken.
the
dog
fight
goes
on
whether
mr.
stevens
is
there
with
his
camera
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
it
was
legal
for
him
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
even
--
what
i
would
like
you
to
confront
is
that
the
very
taking
of
the
picture
is
the
offense.
that's
the
abuse
of
the
child.
the
abuse
of
the
dog
and
the
promotion
of
the
fight
is
separate
from
the
filming
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
this
--
would
this
record
support
any
ban?
i
mean,
there
was
a
real
concentration
on
crush
videos.
so
there
is
that.
is
there
anything
else
in
the
current
record
other
than
the
crush
videos?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
the
government
does.
it
says
that
is
how
you
dry
up
the
market.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
indication
that
there
has
been
any
dry-up
of
the
market
for
dog
fights
as
a
result
of
this
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
alito
suggested
that
until
the
third
circuit's
decision,
that
there
were
fewer
crush
videos
produced.
but
with
respect
to
dog
fights,
animal
fights,
is
there
any
indication
that
there
has
been
--
there
have
been
fewer
animal
fights
as
a
result
of
this
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
goes
with
snuff
movies
--
snuff
movies.
i
don't
know
if
they
really
exist,
but
they
have
been
described.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
prosecutions
have
there
been
for
crush
videos?
