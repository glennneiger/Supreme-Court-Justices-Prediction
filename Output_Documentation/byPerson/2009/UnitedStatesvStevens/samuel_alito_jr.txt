justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
justice
scalia
spoke
about
the
aficionada
of
spanish
bullfighting.
suppose
that
i
am
an
aficionado
of
the
sort
gladiatorial
contests
that
used
to
take
place
in
ancient
rome,
and
suppose
that
some
--
rome
or
some
other
place
decides
that
it
wants
to
make
money
by
staging
these
things
and
selling
videos
of
them
or
broadcasting
them
live
around
the
world.
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
that
could
be
prohibitive?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
gladiatorial
contests
where
the
gladiators
fight
to
the
death.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
that
could
be
prohibited?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
no,
not
under
this
statute,
under
a
different
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
crush
videos,
which
apparently
were
the
focus
of
congress's
attention
when
it
drafted
these?
now,
i
suppose
by
an
analogy
to
what
justice
scalia
just
said
about
the
message
of
dog
fighting
videos,
the
people
who
produce
crush
videos
think
they
have
a
message,
and
the
message
is
that
this
is
--
this
is
sexually
exciting
or
it's
exciting
in
some
way
to
see
a
woman
in
high
heeled
shoes
crushing
a
little
animal
to
death.
do
you
think
that
is
constitutionally
protected?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
are
not
--
you
are
not
even
willing
to
say
that
that
could
be
prohibited?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
a
properly
drawn
statute--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--might.
i
would
really
like
you
to
tell
me
whether
it
would;
whether
you
are
willing
to
concede.
because
we
are
trying
to
determine
whether
this
is
overly
broad.
and
this
is
the
category
of
activity
that
congress
particularly
targeted.
so
to
me
at
least
it's
important
to
know
whether
at
least
as
applied
to
what
congress
principally
had
in
mind,
the
statute
could
--
could
pass
constitutional
muster.
if
it
were,
you
know,
as
applied.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
in
determining
whether
this
is
over
--
overly
broad,
do
we
--
do
we
think
of
all
of
the
hypotheticals
that
we
possibly
can
think
of
that
might
fall
within
this
statute:
somebody
hunting
in
the
district
of
columbia,
somebody
producing
fois
gras
with
a
goose
and
say,
"well,
we've
thought
of
a
lot
of
hypothetical
situations
where
this
statute
might
apply
and
therefore
it's
overly
broad?
"
or
do
we
look
at
what's
going
on
in
the
real
world?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
we
really
think
of
all
the
hypotheticals.
that's
how
you
think
we
determine
the
constitutionality
of
this
under
the
overbreadth
doctrine?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it's
the
fact
that
during
the
ten
years
when
this
statute
has
been
in
effect
there
has
been
no
decrease
in
hunting
videos
and
hunting
shows
on
tv,
and
all
of
the
rest
--
the
only
perceptible
change
in
the
real
world
is
that
these
--
is
that
the
market
for
crush
videos
dried
up,
at
least
until
the
third
circuit's
decision,
does
that
have
any
relevance?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
due
to
changes
in
technology?
before
people
could
show
--
could
watch
videos
at
home,
this
sort
of
thing
would
--
would
be
very
difficult.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
is
there
--
in
the
real
world
is
there
a
market
for
sketches
of
dog
fights?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
people
get
a
thrill
from
seeing
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
that's
100
percent,
then
what
about
people
who
--
who
like
to
see
human
sacrifices?
suppose
that
is
legally
taking
place
someplace
in
the
world.
i
mean,
people
here
would
probably
love
to
see
it.
live,
pay
per
view,
you
know,
on
the
human
sacrifice
channel.
[laughter]
they
have
a
point
of
view
they
want
to
express.
that's
okay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
if
there
is
no
chance
of
drawing
up
the
activity?
suppose
you
have
the
ethnic
cleansing
channel
on
cable
tv,
and
there
is
no
--
this
is
taking
place
in
a
country
that's
beyond
our
power
to
influence.
congress
couldn't
prohibit
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
complicated
arbitration
issues
and
so
for
present
purposes,
it
suffices
to
say
that
we
hold
that
imposing
class
arbitration
on
parties
who
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
their
disputes
but
have
not
agreed
to
authorize
class
arbitration
is
not
consistent
with
the
federal
arbitration
act.
we
therefore
reverse
and
remand.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
breyer
have
joined.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
