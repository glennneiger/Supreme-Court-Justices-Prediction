justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
and
what
case
--
what
case
do
you
have
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
where
we
said
a
statute
which
might
otherwise
be
overbroad
is
not
overbroad
because
prosecutors
have
been
restrained?
can
you
give
me
one
case
where
we've
said
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
a
case
where
we
knew
what
the
content
was.
the
content
was
not
subject
to
an
--
to
an
overbreadth
challenge.
the
content
was
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
--
that
went
to
intent.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
your
framework
is
and
if
it
is
wrong,
tell
me
that
it
is
wrong.
this
statute
without
the
exceptions
clause
would
be
wildly
overbroad.
so
you
say
it's
not
overly
broad
because
of
the
exception
or
the
savings
clause.
i
will
call
it
the
exceptions.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
exceptions
must
be
then
tested
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
vague.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
have
you
to
show
that
they
are
not
vague.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
more
--
one
more
question
along
the
lines
of
justice
alito.
forget
this
statute.
under
a
properly
drawn
statute,
suppose
that
bull-fighting
or
pitbull-fighting
is
unlawful
in
every
state.
could
a
theater
have
a
live
broadcast
of
a
pitbull
fight
in
japan
and
charge
ten
dollars?
and
let's
add
the
hypothetical
fact
that
a
lot
of
the
revenue
goes
back
to
japan
and
promotes
more
bull-fighting.
could
a
properly
drawn
statute
prohibit
that?
and
then
perhaps
justice
scalia,
alito,
has
a
follow-up
question
on
his
own
hypothetical.
could
a
properly
drawn
statute
prohibit
that,
that
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
are
asking
whether
or
not
that
specific
instance
could
be
prohibited
under
a
properly
drawn
statute,
just
like
justice
alito's
hypothetical
was
under
a
properly
drawn
statute
you
could
prohibit
the
conduct,
the
speech
broadcast
in
that
conduct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
answer
to
my
hypothetical
is
yes
it
could
be
prohibited
under
a
properly
drawn
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
an
argument
--
excuse
me.
suppose
an
argument
had
been
made
to
the
court
in
ferber,
that,
you
know,
it's
really
good
for
people
to
see
molestation
of
children
because
then
they
will
be
outraged
and
they
will
enforce
the
statute
more.
i
just
can't
see
the
court
accepting
that
argument
for
a
single
--
for
a
minute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
the
argument
you
are
making.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
--
if
there
is
a
significant
chance
that
congress
can
affect
an
illegal
market,
an
illegal
activity
by
a
statutory
regulation
we
ought
to
defer
to
congress
on
that
ground.
i
think
you
still
have
speech
arguments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
this
economic
causation,
i
think
we
have
to
defer
to
congress
largely.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
hypothetical
about
human
sacrifice?
