why
wouldn't
that
simply
be
going
through
the
motions?
the
second
circuit
put
the
wrong
label
on
it,
but
everything
it
said
could
have
been
plugged
into:
our
decision
is
under
rule
12(b)(6)
rather
than
12(b)(1)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
they
come
down
on
your
side
if
they
say
there
is
no
private
right
of
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dubbs,
you
said
something
that
i
thought
quite
revealing
in
this
--
in
your
brief.
i
mean,
this
case
is
australian
plaintiff,
australian
defendant,
shares
purchased
in
australia.
it
has
"australia"
written
all
over
it.
and
in
your
reply
brief
you
said:
"if
the
plaintiff
is
a
foreign
securities
purchaser
as
this
one
is,
sinochem
makes
it
clear
that
forum
non
conveniens
may
dictate
dismissal
of
an
action
brought
in
the
u.s..
"
and
taking
that,
why
not
--
of
the
applicable
laws
to
this
transaction,
to
this
alleged
fraud,
isn't
the
most
appropriate
choice
the
law
of
australia
rather
than
the
law
of
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
just
a
question
of
proper
forum,
but
the
proper
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
all
that
were
done
and
it
were
never
communicated,
there
wouldn't
be
any
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
communication
was
done
in
australia
by
the
australian
bank.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
--
let's
go
back
to
the
question
that
i
asked
you
about
the
appropriate
forum.
you
--
you
seem
to
give
this
very
case
--
the
plaintiff
is
a
foreign
securities
purchaser.
when
the
plaintiff's
choice
is
not
--
is
not
its
home
forum,
the
presumption
in
the
plaintiff's
favor
applies
with
less
force,
et
cetera.
but
you
have
an
australian
plaintiff
suing
in
the
united
states
based
on
shares
purchased
in
australia
and
the
lead
defendant
is
the
australian
bank.
so
what
--
what
did
you
mean
when
you
were
referring
to
sinochem
and
forum
non
conveniens?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
had
only
homeside's
conduct,
nothing
else,
there
wouldn't
be
any
violation
of
10(b);
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
nothing
has
happened.
suppose
it
had
been
caught
by
the
australian
bank,
and
they
didn't
act
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
i
concede
your
argument
that
a
big
component
of
this
fraud
was
what
went
on
in
florida,
but
it
needed
to
be
disclosed
to
the
public.
it
needed
to
be
put
out
there.
and
that
wasn't
done
in
florida
by
the
florida
defendants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
if
it's
decided
here,
unless
you
want
to
say,
the
australian
court
to
say,
the
united
states
taking
this
case
is
so
outrageous
that
we
will
not
respect
its
judgment.
and
that's
a
factor,
too.
it's
--
what
conflict
of
laws
is
all
about
is
you
have
two
jurisdictions,
both
with
an
interest
in
applying
their
own
law,
but
sometimes
one
defers
to
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
morrison--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dubbs,
morrison,
the
first-named
plaintiff,
was
a
derivative
holder.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you
have
--
you
have
two
classes
of
plaintiffs,
one
the
australians,
who
bought
their
shares
in
australia;
then
you
have
morrison,
who
has
an
adr,
and
who
is
dismissed
because
he
wasn't
able
to
show
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
u.s.
investor
was
harmed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--purchased
--
purchased
or
sold?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
--
on
the
extraterritorial
presumption
against
it,
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
tells
us
that
in
all
the
cases
where
the
presumption
applied,
all
of
the
conduct
was
someplace
else,
and
they
give
the
aramco
case
and
say
that
was
an
employee
hired
in
--
was
it
saudi
arabia--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
everything
happened
outside
the
country.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here,
i
mean,
you
have
to
concede
that
a
component
of
the
alleged
fraud
occurred
in
florida.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
roberts,
because
your
time
is
running
out,
there
is
a
basic
question
here.
you
are
asking
us
to
make
a
distinction
between
what
the
sec
can
sue
for
and
what
a
private
party
can
sue
for.
congress
did
that
with
respect
to
aiders
and
abettors.
is
there
any
other
instance
in
which
we
have
made
a
distinction,
yes,
the
sec
has
a
claim
but
the
private
litigant
doesn't?
