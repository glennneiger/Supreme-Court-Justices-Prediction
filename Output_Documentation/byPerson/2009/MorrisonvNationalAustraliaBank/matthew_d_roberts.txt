mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
distinct
questions:
first
whether
the
fraud
alleged
by
petitioners
violated
section
10b;
and
second,
whether
petitioners
may
bring
a
private
action.
in
our
view,
the
alleged
fraud
violated
section
10b,
because
significant
conduct
material
to
the
fraud's
success
occurred
in
the
united
states.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
so.
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the
direct
cause
part,
which
it
will
be
--
the
significant
limit
on
private
actions,
as
this
case
illustrates,
the
district
courts
even
accepting
the
allegations
in
the
plaintiff's
complaint
will
often
be
able
to
dismiss
the
suit
on
the
pleading
for
its
failure
to
satisfy
that
test.
it's
not
a
difficult
test--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
right.
and
in
terms
of
the
other
test,
again,
i
don't
think
it's
that
complicated.
the
--
the
significance
part
of
it
is
essentially
trying
to
assess
the
amount
of
the
conduct
of--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--if
--
if
--
the
critical
question
is
whether
there's
significant
conduct
here
that's
material
to
the
broad
success.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
if
section
10b
didn't
cover
that
kind
of
conduct,
then
that
would
risk
allowing
the
united
states
to
become
a
base
for
orchestrating
securities
frauds
for
export.
it
would
allow
thing
like
masterminds
in
the
united
states
engineering
international
boiler
room
schemes
in
which
they
direct
agents
in
foreign
countries
to
make
fraudulent
representations
that
victimize
investors.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
schmidt
is
in
germany?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
defrauder
is
in
germany?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
can
i
ask
you
if
everybody
is
in
germany?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
okay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
okay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm
sorry.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
question
is,
is
there
significant
conduct
in
the
united
states--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
right.
and
the
sec
would
be
able
to
take
action
if
there
is
significant
conduct
in
the
united
states--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--if
the
conduct
is
directed
or
controlled
from
the
united
states--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--then
it
would
--
then
the
direct
causation
test
would
be
--
would
be
met.
the
critical
question
is,
is
the
conduct
in
the
united
states
have
a
close
enough--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--in
terms
of
a
private
plaintiff
suing,
in
our
view,
the
question
is
whether
the
united
states'
conduct
has
a
close
enough
connection
to
their
--
to
--
to
their
injury--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
if
the
action
was
just
ministerial
over
overseas,
it
would
--
it
would
be
met.
again,
the
critical
question,
in
our
view,
under
the
direct
cause
test
is,
was
there
culpable
conduct
in
the
united
states
that
is
directly
responsible
for
the
plaintiff's
injury?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
--
the
fact
that
the
transaction
happens
on
the
australian
exchange
is
not
dispositive,
because
if
--
if
somebody
in
the
united
states
is
directly
--
is
--
is
executing
the
fraud
--
if
it
turned
on
just
a
transaction
on
the
australian
exchange,
then
a
domestic
investor
could
be
injured
by
a
fraud
that
is
hatched
entirely
here
that
is
executed
entirely
here,
and
he
is
tricked
into
executing
a
transaction
on
an
overseas
exchange.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
the
--
the
--
the
private
litigants
are
--
have
numerous
elements
that
they
have
to
show
that
the
sec
doesn't
have
to
show:
reliance,
loss,
loss
causation.
all
of
those
go
to
the
causal
link
between
the
injury
and
--
and
the
fraud.
and
we
think
that
the
direct
injury
requirement
is
an
appropriate
application
of
those
more
general
causation
requirements
in
the
context
of
transnational
fraud.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
don't
think
it's
a
--
a
jurisdictional
question
in
the
sense
of
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
it's
a
--
a
test
about
the
scope
of
the
statutory
coverage.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
it's
true
that
bright
line
rules
--
it's
true
that
bright
line
rules
are
easier
to
administer,
but
the
--
there
is
a
danger
in
bright
line
rules
for
fraud
prohibitions
because
they
can
provide
a
road
map
for
evasion
of
the
statute.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
by
australia
and
united
kingdom
and
france
are
limited
to
the
private
right
of
action.
they
base
their
--
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
limit
the
private
rights.
and
i
think
the
united
kingdom
brief
specifically
says
that
--
it
thinks
that
sec
action
could
be
appropriate
here,
and
that's
a
reason
why,
if
the
court
adopts
the
--
a
limit
on
the
private
actions,
that
it
need
not
--
it
need
not
be
concerned
about
the
possibility
that
--
that
fraud
would
be
launched
in
the
united
states
or
directed
in
the
united
states
and
it
couldn't
be
addressed.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
and
we
would
certainly
prefer
that
you
decided
the
case
solely
on
the
private
right
of
action
if
the
alternative
for
a
holding
substantive
prohibitions
didn't
apply
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
those
are
the
two
administrative
adjudications.
the
sec's
administrative
adjudicatory
authority
is
limited
to
people
involved
in
the
securities
industry,
and
a
lot
of
these
frauds
that
happen
are
--
don't
involve
people
that
are
registered
broker/dealers
and
the
like.
there
are
numerous
civil
actions
that
the
sec
has
brought
where
it
has
taken
the
same
approach.
the
sec
v.
berger
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
is
one
of
them.
i
can
name
some
others.
there
is
sec
v.
wolfson,
which
is
a
case
that's
in
the
district
court
in
utah,
and
sec
v.
shay
in
--
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
sec
v.
banger
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
those
involve
international
boiler-room
schemes
of
the
kind
i
was
alluding
to
before,
where
masterminds
in
the
united
states
basically
direct
agents
that
they
have
got
in
countries
like
thailand
or
spain
to
--
to
make
false
statements
and
engage
in
high-pressure
selling
to
target
investors
in
other
countries.
sometimes
they
induce
them
to
engage
in
transactions
in
still
other
countries.
so--
