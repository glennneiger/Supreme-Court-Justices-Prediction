mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
for
two
reasons.
first,
petitioners
have
identified
nothing
in
the
text
of
section
10(b)
that
overcomes
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
or
the
charming
betsy
rule.
the
statutes
should
thus
be
construed
not
to
apply
to
transactions
and
shares
of
foreign
issuers
on
foreign
exchanges.
second,
unlike
the
rights
of
action
that
this
court
has
addressed
in
other
extraterritoriality
cases,
the
section
10(b)
right
is
purely
implied.
congress
didn't
intend
for
this
right
of
action
to
exist
even
domestically,
let
alone
extraterritorially.
given
the
threat
that
the
section
10(b}
implied
right
presents
to
the
sovereign
authority
of
other
nations,
as
reflected
in
the
amicus
briefs
of
australia,
the
united
kingdom,
france,
and
the
diplomatic
note
from
the
swiss
government,
the
court
should
construe
the
implied
right
not
to
extend
to
claims
of
purchasers
and
sellers
of
securities
of
foreign
issuers
on
foreign
markets.
the
two
clear
statement
rules
are,
obviously,
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
and
the
charming
betsy
rule.
both
require
an
affirmative
intention
of
the
congress
clearly
expressed
before
the
statute
can
be
applied
to
apply
to
foreign
transactions
or
to,
you
know,
matters
that
it
infringes
on
the
sovereign
authority
on
other
nations.
my
friends
don't
identify
anything
in
the
statute
that
comes
even
close
to
a
clear
statement.
they
principally
rely
on
the
definition
of
"interstate
commerce",
but
as
this
court
said
in
aramco,
that
kind
of
boilerplate
simply
doesn't
suffice
to
overcome
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--well,
our
test
is
that,
at
a
minimum,
section
10b
should
be
held
not
to
apply
to
transactions
involving
shares
of
foreign
issues
on
foreign
exchanges,
because
that
presents
the
greatest
danger
of
conflict
of
foreign
law,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
modern
section
10b
implied
right,
which
has
the
fraud
on
the
market
presumption
and
holds
issuers
liable,
as
here
for
example,
for
two
and
a
half
years
of
trading,
all
on
an
australian
exchange.
that
is
massive
transfer
of
wealth
that
the
petitioners
here
are
seeking
an
american
court
to
effect,
and
that
is
--
basically,
it's
a
direct
form
of
market
regulation
that
australia
has
not
seen
fit
to
impose
upon
itself.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
we
would
--
well,
we
would
submit
that
that
rule
should
be
the
same.
that
they
should
--
they
should
not
also,
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
sue
under
section
10b.
they
--
they
--
you
know,
those
people
chose
to
purchase
on
the
australian
exchange.
and
in
terms
of
the
threat
to
international
comity,
i
think
it
would
be
probably
take
--
i
don't
think
other
countries
would
take
nicely
to
a
--
to
a
rule
of
law
that
would
allow
americans,
essentially,
to
bring
their
rules,
their
law,
their
remedies,
fraud,
on
the
market,
what
have
you
to
foreign
countries--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--yes.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
well,
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
i
think
the
fraud
is
carried
out
when
the
transaction
occurs
in
a
foreign
country.
but
i
do
agree
that
professor
sachs
is
absolutely
right--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--yes.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
yes,
sir.
[laughter]
that's
a
much
different
case,
obviously,
than
the
fraud
in
the
market
case
that
we
have
here.
but
your
honor,
yes,
that
is
a
stronger
circumstance.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
problem
is,
in
order
to
have
that
conduct
swept
within
the
statute,
you
have
to
ignore
the
language
and
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality.
if
you
go
to
petition
appendix
78,
that
has
its
text
in
section
10b,
and
section
10b
refers
to
the
use
or
employment
of
any
manipulative
device
or
contrivance,
and
it's
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security
registered
on
a
national
securities
exchange.
and
that's--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--that's
correct.
any
security
not
so
registered.
and
this
court
has
held
--
it
has
held
in
cases
like
aramco,
american
banana,
moritson,
that
the
words
"any"
and
"every",
words
of
universal
scope,
do
not
--
do
not
mean
that
these
--
that
something
referred
to
is
anything,
anywhere
else
in
the
world.
and
for
example,
the
court
in
small
against
the
united
states.
in
the
case
where
the
presumption
of
extraterritoriality
didn't
really
apply
the
court
held
that
in
a
statute,
you
normally
assume
that
things
being
referred
to
are
thing
in
the
united
states.
now--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--i
think
they
do.
i
think
they
look
to
--
i
think
their
view
is
that
the
statute
is
vague
and
you
have
to
do
essentially
what
judge
friendly
did
and
the
seventh
circuit
did
for
many
years,
is
you
have
to
make
do
and
decide
what
the
best
rule
is.
and
with
respect
to
the
government,
that
is
essentially
doing
what
this
court
has
said
under
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
the
court
shouldn't
do.
that's
essentially
legislating,
trying
to
figure
out
what
congress
would
have
done,
had
"a
particular
problem"--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--your
honor,
i
think
the
problem
with
the
government's
test
and
with
the
second
circuit's
test,
is
that
it
would
still
allow
the
application
of
u.s.
law
in
a
manner
that
would
infringe
the
sovereign
authority
of
other
nations.
and
i
can
give
an
example.
there
was
a
case
over
the
summer
that
the
petitioners
attached
to
their
first
supplemental
brief
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
and
it's
a
case
called
cp
shifts.
and
it's
an
interesting
case
because
it
involved
a
canadian
company
with
headquarters
in
britain
and
most
of
whose
shares
traded
on
the
toronto
stock
exchange.
and
what
happened
there
was
that
the
ceo
spent
time
in
florida
--
it
was
a
shipping
company.
we
spent
time
in,
miami
running
the
show
from
miami.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit,
in
a
ruling
that
it
held
was
consistent
with
the
second
circuit
decision
in
this
case
held
that
nonetheless,
the
application
of
u.s.
law
could
be
applied
to
transactions
of
--
of
foreign
plaintiffs
on
the
toronto
stock
exchange.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
yes,
discovery
alone.
yes,
your
honor.
discovery
alone.
i
think
the
french
brief,
for
example,
points
that
out.
i
think
a
number
of
the
brief
--
there
have
been
blocking
statutes
that
have
been
enacted
by
various
countries
because
of
the
--
what
they
deem
to
be
the
offensive
scope
of
discovery.
in
france,
you
are
really
only
allowed
to
obtain
evidence
that
is
actually
admissible
in
trial.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
it
should
only
be
applied--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute.
and
this
court
is
required,
under
both
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
under
its
decision
and
the
charming
betsy
rule
to
interpret
a
statute,
take
the
permissible
construction
of
the
statute
that
is
least
likely
to
result
in
an
extraterritorial
of
the
law.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
purchased
or
sold,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
that
that
would
state
a
claim,
a
private
claim
under
blue
chip
stamps.
and
any
--
and
if
the
share
or
the
securities
are
held
abroad,
if
it's
a
foreign
security,
and
i
think
the
liability
in
that
hypothetical
--
i'm
assuming
that
if
it's
a
foreign
security
held
by
a
foreigner
--
that
really
would
be
something
that
would
be
subject
to
foreign
law,
whether
or
not
australia
wants
to
represent
--
recognize
holder
claims
of
the
sort
that
this
court
rejected
in
blue
chip
stamps.
that's
a
question
for
australia
to
decide.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
no,
and
in
fact,
we
told
the
district
court,
we
did
not
move
to
defense
on
extraterritoriality
grounds
the
claims
of
mr.
morrison,
who
inexplicably
is
still
here.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
we
argued
that
mr.
morrison's
claims
should
be
defeated
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
no
damages,
which
was
an
absolutely
ironclad
calculation
best
based
on
a
--
on
a
provision
of
the
pslra,
and
we
also
argued
that
all
of
the
claims
should
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
plead
fraud
with
the
requisite
particularity
of
the
pslra.
but
we
certainly
do
not
dispute
that
when
a
company
like
ours
registers
shares
on
--
registers
shares
with
the
sec,
adrs
with
its
sec
and
lists
them
on
a
new
york
stock
exchange,
it's
subjecting
itself
to
new
york
--
i
mean,
u.s.
law
for
purposes
of
those--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--it
could,
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
true.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
mean,
a
lot
of
the
other
aspects
of
--
of
this
litigation,
which
this
court
has,
you
know,
noted
that
is
potentially
highly
vexatious,
i
mean,
that
is
only
1.1
percent
of
the
flow
--
of
the
total
equity
securities
of
the
--
the
national
australia
bank.
so
the
dangers
of
--
of
a
threat
of
--
of
coerced
settlements
is
much,
much
less.
it's
a
much,
much
easier
case
to
deal
with
if
--
if
--
if
you
are
only
dealing
with
the
adrs.
now
if
another
company
decides
to
list
half
its
equity
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
well,
it
can
--
it
makes
the
determination
for
itself,
how
much
of
this
kind
of
litigation
it
wants
to
subject
itself
to.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
i
think
the
--
i
think
you
have
to
take
each
statute
separately.
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
language
of
the
statute
says,
whether
it
--
it
admits
fault
in
an
extraterritorial
reading,
and
whether
that
--
frankly
whether
that
extraterritorial
reading
is
required
or
compelled.
if
there
is
any
other
possible
construction,
as
the
court
said
in
--
in
charming
betsy,
the
court
is
required
to
accept
that
construction,
accept
the
construction
that
doesn't
result
in
extraterritorial
application
or
doesn't
result
in--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--that--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--well,
my--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--we
do
concede
that
some
of
the
conduct
that
ultimately,
you
know,
led
--
in
a
but-for
causal
relationship
to
what
happened
in
the
australia
occurred
in
the
united
states,
but
that's
true
in
a
lot
of
other
cases.
for
example,
aramco,
mr.
boureslan
was
hired
in
houston.
so
was
the
cook
in
foley
brothers
v.
filardo.
and
in
microsoft
v.
at&t,
basically
all
of
the
conduct,
the
relevant
conduct
was
in
the
united
states,
because
what
the
--
what
section
271(f)
proscribed
in
microsoft
was
the
shipment
--
the
supply
in
or
from
the
united
states
of
a
component
of
a
patented
invention.
and
what
this
court
held
in
microsoft
was
that
notwithstanding
at&t's
argument
that,
"hey,
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
doesn't
really
apply
because
this
is
just
regulating
the
supply
in
and
from
the
united
states.
"
this
court
held
that
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
applied
because
what
would
happen
is,
a
single
act
of
supply
would
result
in
a
springboard
for
liability
each
time
a
--
a
disk
was
put
into
a
computer
abroad.
and
that
is
exactly
analogous
to
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
where
what
we
--
what
happened
was
some
--
some
allegedly
false
information
was
transmitted
to
australia;
it
was
then
republished
in
annual
reports,
print,
print,
print;
sent
out
to
the
--
sent
out
to
the
australian
market,
and
resulted
in
--
allegedly,
as
they
would
have
it
--
resulted
in
liability
every
single
time
somebody
purchased
--
purchased
a
share
of
stock
of
the
national
australia
bank
on
the
australian
securities
exchange.
and
so
that
is
exactly
analogous
to
--
to
microsoft
v.
at&t.
again,
another
point
i
think
that's
relevant
is
the,
section
30
of
the
exchange
act.
congress
did
not
make
a
clear
statement
in
section
10.
it
did
make
clear
statements
in
section
30.
section
30(a)
addresses
transactions
on
foreign
exchanges.
section
30
as
a
whole
is
entitled
foreign
exchanges,
and
section
30(a)
makes
it
--
makes
--
gives
the
sec
power
to
promulgate
regulations
that
--
that
apply
to
brokers
and
dealers
who
effect
transactions
of
securities
on
foreign
exchanges,
if
those
transactions
are
transactions
of
shares
of
shares
of
u.s.
issuers.
and
that's
at
--
for
reference,
the
text
of
section
30
is
at
page
19
of
the
law
professors'
brief.
and
section
30(b)
also,
it
says
that
the
sec
can
regulate
the
--
regulate
businesses
in
securities
of
--
of
businesses
--
securities
that
are
abroad,
but
only
to
the
extent
the
sec
finds
it
necessary
to
prevent
evasion
of
the
act
domestically.
and
so
congress
made
two
clear
statements
in
section
30.
it
did
not
make
any
clear
statement
in
section
10.
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
that's--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--that's
absolutely
right.
the
reading
--
my
friend's
reading
of
section
30
would
render
section
10(b)
--
i
mean
the
reading
of
section
10(b)
would
render
section
30
superfluous.
and
there
are
other
provisions
of
--
that
are
in
the
exchange
act
where
congress
has
made
clear
statements
to
show
that
it
can
make
clear
statements.
section
30a
which
immediately
follows
section
30,
is
the
foreign
corrupt
practices
act.
so
congress
--
if
congress
--
if
there
is
a
loophole,
and
that's
what
this
court
said
in
microsoft
v.
at
if
there
is
some
kind
of
loophole
that
presents
some
kind
of
a
problem,
that
congress
needs
to
fix,
congress
can
do
it.
congress
can
do
it
with
a
clear
statement.
in
sum,
your
honors,
countries
--
nations
of
the
world
do
things
differently.
they
--
they
--
they
have
different
rules
of
liability.
we
see
in
the
amicus
briefs
different
rules
of
materiality,
different
rules
of
disclosure.
and
some
rely
on
--
on
public
enforcement
more
than
others.
the
french
rely
on
l'action
publique,
as
they
say;
and
some
nations
approach
ours
in
their
generosity
to
plaintiffs.
australia
allows
opt-out
class
actions;
so
does
canada.
canada
allows
opt-out
class
actions;
it
dispenses
with,
for
example,
the
proof
of
reliance,
it
dispenses
with
scienter
in
some
cases.
yet
it
--
it
does
all
that,
but
it
restricts
liability
to
$1
million
or
5
percent
of
a
--
of
a
company's--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--well,
it
hurts
australia--
mr.
george
t.
conway
iii
--exactly
the
same
way
this
court
said
it
hurts
in
empagran.
in
empagran
this
court
noted
that
--
that
a
reading
of
the
rule
that
would
allow
--
a
reading
of
the
ftaia
that
would
have
allowed
foreign
plaintiffs
to
come
and
sue
for
--
for
foreign
vitamins
transaction
in
a
foreign
country
would
essentially
allow
plaintiffs
to
avoid
the
--
the
narrower
rules
of
the
liability
and
the
narrower
remedies
that
other
nations
provide.
and
that
is
exactly
true
here,
where,
you
know,
for
example,
australia
does
not
permit
fraud-on-the-market
class
actions.
it
doesn't
allow
--
it
doesn't
recognize
the
fraud-on-the-market
presumption.
and
as
i
said,
for
example,
canada
restricts
these
actions,
it
has
generous
liability
rules
and
allows
opt-out
class
actions,
but
it
says
--
it
caps
damages
at
5
percent
of
an
issuer's
market
capitalization
or
$1
million,
whichever
is
greater.
and
so
that's
the
--
that
is
the
problem.
it's
not
just
substance
but
it's
remedy.
other
nations
want
to
do
things
in
different
ways;
they
should
be
allowed
to.
what
is
going
on
here
is
essentially
a
--
brandeising
--
experiment
a
global
scale.
and
that's
a
good
thing.
it's
a
good
thing
because
it
enables
countries
to
judge
for
themselves
what
kind
of
rules
they
want
to
have
for
people
who
buy
shares
on
their
own
exchanges.
and
to
apply
section
10(b)
it
cases
like
this
would
cut
that
experiment
short.
it
would
amount
to
exactly
the
soft
of
legal
imperialism
that
this
court
rejected,
rightly,
in
empagran.
the
court
should
reject
it
here
as
well
and
it
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
thank
you.
