justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
there's
also
the
issue
of
whether,
if
everybody
is
agreed
that
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
question,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
i
mean,
as
i
recall,
the
other
side
says
we
shouldn't
get
to
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
are
not
--
you
are
not
pressing
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
isn't
worth
anything,
right?
i
mean,
that's
--
they
haven't
conducted
a
rulemaking
or
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
just
--
just
appeared
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
they
don't
come
out
on
your
side
anyway,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
only
talking
about
this
case.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
are
only
talking
about
this
case,
right?
if
we
send
it
back,
we
send
it
back
to
have
this
case
decided
and
they'd
come
out
against
you
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
could
--
and
that
is
going
to
change
the
second
circuit's
view
of
things,
the
fact
that,
in
addition
to
their
initial
opinion,
it
has
been
reconfirmed,
although
on
different
grounds,
by
--
by
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
reason
to
send
it
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
--
but
australia
says:
look,
it's
up
to
us
to
decide
whether
there
has
been
a
misrepresentation,
point
one;
and
whether
it's
been
relied
upon
by
the
--
by
the
plaintiffs,
point
two.
and
we
should
be
able
to
decide
that
and
we
don't
want
it
decided
by
a
foreign
court.
you
are
talking
about
a
misrepresentation,
if
there
was
one
in
this
case,
made
in
australia
to
australian
purchasers;
it
ought
to
be
up
to
us
to
decide
that
issue;
and
here
you
are
dragging
the
american
courts
into
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
to
these
plaintiffs.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
have
to
join
the
misrepresentation
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
misrepresentation
to
these
plaintiffs
was
made
in
australia
by
an
australian
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
--
that
isn't
the
issue.
the
--
the
--
the
issue
for
the
australians
is:
we
want
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
misrepresentation
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
want
the
determination
of
whether
there
has
been
a
misrepresentation
on
the
australian
exchange
and
whether
australian
purchasers
relied
upon
that
misrepresentation
to
be
determined
by
an
american
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
is
your
test
for
whether
--
whether
it's
being
applied
internationally
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
how
you
interpret
the
language
that
you
--
that
you
just
read,
when
you
say
to
use
or
employ
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security
registered
on
the
national
security
exchange
or
any
security
not
so
registered.
now,
is
it
your
point
that
in
order
to
avoid
an
international
extension
of
it,
it
should
apply
only
to
securities?
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
securities
purchased
and
sold
in
the
united
states?
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it's
not
--
what
if
it
--
what
if
the
fraud
produces
neither
a
purchase
or
a
sale
but
induces
somebody
to
hold
on
to
stock
that
otherwise
the
person
would
dispose
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
that
your
only
point?
or
is
your
point
also
that
you
wouldn't
need
section
30
if
--
if
10(b)
were--
justice
antonin
scalia
--were
read
as
broadly.
justice
antonin
scalia
schmidt
is
the
german.
he's
in
germany.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
frankly
less
concerned
with
your
--
your
test
for
the
private
cause
of
action,
the
direct
cause
test
--
i
--
i
guess
i
could
work
with
that
--
than
i
am
with
your
test
for
--
for
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
sec,
which
is
sort
of
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that's
an
appropriate
test
for
a
jurisdictional
question.
you
don't
want
to
spend
time
litigating
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we
don't
have
to
say
anything
about
--
about
what
the
government
can
do,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondent
national
australia
bank
limited
was
the
largest
bank
in
australia.
its
ordinary
shares
what
in
america
would
be
called
common
stock,
were
traded
on
the
australian
stock
exchange,
and
on
other
foreign
securities
exchanges
but
not
on
any
exchange
in
the
united
states.
the
complaint
alleges
in
summary
the
following
facts;
national
bought
respondent
homeside
lending,
inc.;
a
mortgage
servicing
company
headquartered
in
florida.
the
value
of
homeside's
assets
appeared
in
national
financial
statements.
from
1998
until
2001,
national’s
annual
reports
and
other
public
documents
touted
the
success
of
home
side's
business
as
did
senior
officers
of
national
and
homeside
who
are
respondents
here.
but
on
two
occasions
in
2001,
national
announced
that
it
was
writing
down
the
value
of
homeside's
assets
by
significant
amounts.
according
to
the
complaint,
homeside
and
three
of
its
senior
officers
had
manipulated
homeside's
financial
models
to
make
its
business
appear
more
successful
than
it
really
was.
the
complaint
alleges
that
national
and
its
chief
executive
officer
were
aware
of
this
deception
by
july
of
2000,
but
did
nothing
about
it.
as
relevant
here,
the
petitioners
russell
leslie
owen
and
brian
and
geraldine
silverlock,
all
australians
purchased
national’s
ordinary
shares
in
australia
before
the
write-downs.
they
sued
national,
its
ceo,
homeside
and
three
homeside
executives
in
the
united
states.
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
for
alleged
violations
of
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
and
sec
rule
10b-5
promulgated
pursuant
to
section
10(b).
they
sought
to
represent
a
class
of
foreign
purchasers
of
nationals
ordinary
shares
during
a
specified
period
up
to
the
last
write-down.
respondents
moved
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
12(b)(1)
and
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
under
rule
12(b)(6).
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
on
the
former
ground
finding
no
jurisdiction
because
the
acts
in
this
country
were
”had
most
link
in
the
chain
of
an
alleged
overall
securities,
fraud
scheme
that
culminated
abroad"
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
on
similar
grounds,
we
granted
certiorari.
our
opinion
first
addresses
a
threshold
error
in
the
second
circuit's
analysis.
the
second
circuit
considered
the
extraterritorial
reach
of
section
12(b)
to
raise
a
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
is
why
it
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal
under
rule
12(b)(1).
but
to
ask
what
conduct
sections
10(b)
reaches
is
to
ask
what
conduct
section
10(b)
prohibits
which
is
a
merit’s
question
not
a
jurisdictional
one.
petitioners
asked
us
to
remand
in
light
of
that
error,
but
we
think
that
unnecessary.
the
same
analysis
that
would
permit
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
under
12(b)(1)
would
also
justify
dismissal
for
fairly
a
dissipated
claim
under
12(b)(6).
so
we
proceed
to
discussion
of
the
merits.
it
is
a
long-standing
principle,
this
is
a
quote
from
one
of
our
cases,
“it
is
a
long-standing
principle
of
american
law
that
legislation
of
congress,
unless
a
contrary
intent
appears,
is
meant
to
apply
only
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.”
this
principle
represents
a
presumption
about
a
statute’s
meaning
rather
than
a
limit
on
congress's
power
to
legislate.
it
rests
on
the
perception
that
congress
ordinarily
legislates
with
respect
to
domestic
not
foreign
matters.
when
a
statute
gives
no
clear
indication
of
an
extraterritorial
application,
it
has
--
despite
this
principle
of
interpretation
a
long
and
often
recited
in
our
opinions,
the
second
circuit
believed
that
because
the
exchange
act
is
silent
as
to
the
extraterritorial
application
of
10(b)
it
was
left
to
the
court
to
“discern"
whether
congress
would
have
wanted
the
statute
to
apply.
this
is
regard
of
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
did
not
originate
with
the
court
of
appeals
panel
in
this
case
but
rather
is
common
to
the
manner
in
which
various
courts
of
appeals
over
many
decades
have
determined
the
application
of
the
exchange
act
and
section
10(b)
in
particular
to
fraudulent
schemes
that
involve
conduct
and
effects
abroad.
these
courts
effectively
excise
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
from
the
jurisprudence
of
section
10(b)
and
replaced
it
with
the
inquiry
whether
it
would
be
reasonable,
and
hence
what
congress
would
have
wanted
for
the
statue
to
apply.
predictably
enough,
the
tests,
the
various
courts
used
to
discern
what
would've
been
congress's
intent
were
not
easy
to
administer
and
became
increasingly
complicated.
while
the
courts
applied
the
same
fundamental
methodology
of
discerning
what
congressional
intent
would
have
been.
they
produced
a
proliferation
of
vaguely
related
conduct
that
affects
tests.
we
think
that
the
results
of
this
judicial
speculation
made
law
divining
what
congress
would've
wanted
if
it
had
thought
of
the
situation
before
the
court,
demonstrate
the
wisdom
of
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
rather
than
guess
a
new
in
each
case,
we
applied
the
presumption
in
all
cases
preserving
a
stable
background
against
which
congress
can
legislate
with
predictable
effects.
on
its
face
section
10(b)
contains
nothing
to
suggest
it
applies
abroad.
petitioners
and
the
solicitor
general
contend
that
there
are
three
indications
in
the
statute
that
we
find
that
none
of
them
is
sufficient
to
overcome
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality.
petitioners
however
contend
that
they
seek
no
more
than
domestic
application
anyway
since
florida
is
where
homeside
and
its
senior
executives
engaged
in
the
deceptive
conduct
of
manipulating
homeside's
financial
models.
this
is
less
than
answer
to
the
presumption
against
extraterritorial
application,
than
it
is
an
assertion
--
a
quite
valid
assertion,
that
the
presumption
here
as
often
is
not
self-evidently
dispositive,
but
its
application
requires
further
analysis.
for
it
is
a
rare
case
that
prohibited
extraterritorial
application
that
lacks
all
contact
with
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
applying
the
mode
of
analysis
we've
employed
in
prior
cases
involving
the
presumption
against
its
territoriality,
we
look
here
to
the
focus
of
the
exchange
act
and
we
find
that
it
is
not
upon
the
place
where
the
deception
originated
which
might
in
florida,
but
upon
the
place
where
the
purchases
and
sales
of
securities
incurred.
section
10(b)
does
not
punish
deceptive
conduct,
but
only
deceptive
conduct
“in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security
registered
on
a
national
securities
exchange
or
any
security
not
so
registered.”
in
its
lowest
transactions
that
the
statute
seeks
to
regulate,
it
is
parties
or
prospective
parties
to
those
transactions
that
the
statute
seeks
to
protect,
and
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
opinion
it
is
in
our
view
only
transactions
and
securities
listed
on
domestic
exchanges
and
domestic
transactions
in
other
securities
to
which
section
10(b)
applies.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
a
different
test
which
petitioners
also
endorse
namely,
a
transactional
securities
fraud
violates
section
10(b)
when
the
fraud
involves
significant
conduct
in
the
united
states
that
is
material
to
the
fraud
success.
neither
the
solicitor
general
nor
petitioners
provide
any
textual
support
for
this
test
nor
is
their
support
for
in
our
precedents.
the
solicitor
general
sets
forth
a
number
of
purposes
which
such
a
test
would
serve
among
which
is
preventing
the
united
states
from
becoming
what
she
calls
a
barbary
coast
for
malefactors
perpetrating
frauds
in
foreign
markets.
it
is
our
function
to
give
the
statute
the
effect
its
language
suggests,
however
modest
that
maybe.
not
to
extend
it
to
admirable
purposes,
it
might
be
used
to
achieve.
if
moreover,
one
is
to
be
attracted
by
the
desirable
consequences
of
the
significant
and
material
conduct
tests,
one
should
also
be
repulsed
by
its
adverse
consequences,
while
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
united
states
has
become
a
barbary
coast
for
those
perpetrating
frauds
abroad,
some
fear
that
it
has
become
the
shangri-la
of
class-action
litigation
for
lawyers
representing
those
allegedly
cheated
in
foreign
securities
markets.
in
short,
section
10(b)
reaches
the
use
of
the
manipulative
or
deceptive
device
or
contrivance
only
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities
listed
on
an
american
stock
exchange
and
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
other
security
in
the
united
states.
this
case
involves
no
securities,
listed
on
domestic
exchange,
have
all
aspects
of
the
purchases
complained
of
by
petitioners
occurred
outside
the
united
states.
petitioners
have
therefore
failed
to
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted.
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
