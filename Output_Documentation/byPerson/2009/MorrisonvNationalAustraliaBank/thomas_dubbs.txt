mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
given
that
the
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
appears
not
to
be
in
dispute,
the
issues
before
the
court
today
are:
first,
the
scope
of
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
exchange
act
when
applied
to
alleged
fraudulent
conduct
with
respect
to
financial
information
that
is
to
be
sent
to
australia
for
incorporation
into
the
financial
statements
of
the
respondent,
national
australia
bank.
and
second,
the
reasonableness
of
the
application
of
the
statute
under
these
circumstances
and
the
norms
of
enforcement
pursuant
to
the
private
cause
of
action
or
otherwise.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
your
honor,
it's
our
view
that
that
--
that
is
a
possible
outcome,
which
of
course
as
i
understand
it
would
leave
--
leave
the
decision
below
standing.
we
have
urged
in
the
supplemental
brief
that
it
may
want
to
remand
for
consideration
of
the
change
of
position
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
with
respect
to
the
tests
that
they
have--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--no,
we
still
believe
that
the
best
way
to
handle
the
case
is
to
remand;
but
we
leave
that
for
the
court's
discretion.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
well,
your
honor,
the
question
and
the
issue
is
inherently
somewhat
speculative
as
to
what
the
second
circuit
would
do,
but
we
would
rely
not
necessarily
only
on
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
issues
being
addressed
--
and
your
honor
is
quite
right
that
they
may
say,
well,
the
label's
changed,
but
everything
else
stays
the
same.
what
we
particularly
thought
might
be
instructive
for
this
court
is
to
hear
what
the
second
circuit
that
sits
in
our
nation's
financial
capital
thought
of
a
new
fact,
and
that
new
fact
is
that
for
the
first
time
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
come
in
and
said
as
a
matter
of
administrative
deference
the
court
should
defer
to
our
test
in
cases
like
that.
sure,
they
have
submitted
amicus
briefs
in
the
past.
they
have
done
lots
of
things.
but
this
is
the
first
time
they
have
said:
we
as
the
agency
responsible
for
the
statute
have
said
this
is
how
courts
should
handle
the
case.
that's
what's
new
and
different,
but
if
your
honors
don't
wish
to
proceed
along
that
line
we
are
prepared
to
go
forward
on
--
on
the
merits
here
today.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
well,
they
haven't
conducted--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--well,
they
haven't
conducted
a
full
rulemaking
that
would
be
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
but
they
have
done
something
less
than
that.
and
whether
it's
entitled
to
deference,
skidmore
deference,
or
something
lesser
than
that
is
an
open
point.
but
so
we
leave
it
to
the
court's
decision
as
to
whether
it
is
just--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--well,
your
honor,
they
come
out
on
our
side
except
for
that
last
turn
they
make
at
the
end,
where
they
--
they
bring
in
the
intervening
clause
at
the
end
of
the
last
act.
other
than
that--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--well,
they
didn't
say
there
was
no
private
right
of
action.
what
they
said
was
there
was
no
private
right
of
action
in
this
case
because
of
their
application
of
the
intervening
clause
test,
which
we
submit
was
error
and
clear
error
in
light
of
the
factors
that
have
to
go
into
the
intervening--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--sorry?
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
they--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--your
honor--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--well,
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
up
to
the
court.
i
mean,
it's
your
--
you're
basically
educating
--
making
an
educated
guess
as
to
whether
the
second
circuit
would
pay
attention
to
the
sec.
in
the
past,
they
have.
they
may
not
now.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
no--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--no,
your
honor.
we
think
that,
given
the
scope
of
section
10(b),
american
law
can
and
should
be
applied
here.
and
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
observation
that
this
case
has
"australia"
written
all
over
it.
indeed,
from
our
point
of
view
it
has
"florida"
written
all
over
it
because
florida
is
where
the
numbers
were
doctored,
florida
is
where
the
fraudulent
conduct
in
putting
the
phony
assumptions
into
the
valuation
portfolio
were
done.
everything
happened--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
the
communication
was
done
between
florida
and
--
and
australia,
and
the
senior
management
of
homeside
in
florida
created
those
numbers
with
the
expectation
and
the
knowledge
that
those
would
go
into
the
financial
statement.
so
that
means
there
is
substantial
conduct
in
florida
in
terms
of
the
fraud.
they
made
the
misrepresentation
pursuant
to
what
1934
dictionary.
they
engaged
in
hard-core
fraudulent
conduct
by
doctoring
the
books,
by
putting
the
phony
assumptions
into
the
computer
model.
without
that
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
phony
number.
in
one
sense
it's
a
one-issue
case,
or
a
one-number
case,
which
is
the
mortgage
servicing
rights
number
that
appears
on
--
on
the
balance
sheet
at
page
11--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--we
meant
two
things,
your
honor.
the
first
thing
we
meant
was
that,
in
addition
to
the
other
tests
that
are
proposed,
putting
sinochem
at
the
beginning
of
the
train
would
sort
out
some
of
these
questions
in
general.
that's
in
general.
as
to
our
particular
case,
we
believe
we
would
win
a
forum
non
conveniens
argument,
though
one
was
never
made
and
that
was
not
explored
by
any
district
judge.
and
we
would
win
that
because
the
statute
specifically
provides
in
section
10(b)
that
fraud
can
be
caused
in
any
number
of
ways
--
three
ways,
including
through
the
mails,
through
foreign
or
interstate
commerce,
or
over
an
exchange.
and
that
fraud
was
caused
in
florida
and
the
mails
were
used
and
it
was
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce.
and
the
people
who
committed
the
fraud
on
a
nuts-and-bolts
level
are
the
senior
management
who
are
defendants
from
homeside
bank
in
florida,
so
to
that
extent
it
is
a
florida
case.
and
we
also
think
that
any
district
judge
in
looking
at
a
forum
non
motion
would
also
look
at
the
various
interests
of
national
australia
bank
in
homeside
in
the
united
states
to
judge
the
overall
fairness
of
letting
the
suit
proceed
against
them
and
to
counter
the
issue
that
this
is
really
all
about
australia.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
we
might
or
we
might
not.
but
that
is
not
determinative.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
there--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--there
is
a
strong
united
states
interest.
it's
on
two
levels.
the
first
strong
united
states
--
united
states
interest
deals
with
the
conduct
at
issue
here,
namely
the
conduct
in
florida
by
homeside.
this
was
the
sixth
largest
mortgage
service
provider
in
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
we
do
not
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
they
made
a
representation
by
creating
the
false
numbers,
or
otherwise
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
what
they
did
is
create
a
deceptive
device--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--your
--
your
honor,
that
goes
to
a
different
element
of
the
cause
of
action.
that
doesn't
go
to
the
scope
of
the
statute.
that
goes
to
how
the
private
cause
of
action
is
enforced.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
it
was
done
in
australia
and
we
can
prove
that.
and
--
the
point
is
we
are
not
--
all
we
are
proving
through
doing
that
is
the
effects
of
the
fraud
in
florida.
to
use
professor
beale's
example,
where
you
have
poison
candy
in
one
jurisdiction,
that
poison
candy
is
sent
to
another
jurisdiction,
and
in
the
first
jurisdiction
there
is
a
law
that
says
"thou
shalt
not
make
poison
candy.
"
through
the
exercise
of
legislative
jurisdiction
that
statute
in
the
first
jurisdiction
is
appropriate,
and
both
jurisdictions
have
an
interest
in
that.
now,
if
we
are
in
the
poison
candy
jurisdiction
and
we
are
bringing
a
case
about
poison
candy,
if
the
statute
in
addition
says,
"you
have
to
show
some
harm
from
the
poison
candy.
"
indeed
you
might
as
a
matter
of
proof
have
to
show
effects
from
that
other
forum.
but
that's
different
than
regulating
conduct
in
the
second
forum
or
anything
else
in
the
second
forum.
that
is
simply
looking
at
the
statute
or
the
legal
prescription
against
making
poison
candy.
and
we
say
section
10(b)
is
like
the
poison
candy
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
i
will
try
to
keep
the
subparts
in
mind.
why
don't
we
start
from
the
end
and
try
to
work
backwards.
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
the
record
is
the
solicitor
general's
view
that
as
a
general
matter
--
and
i
will
get
to
the
specifics;
i'm
not
ducking
that.
but
as
a
general
matter
the
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws,
unlike
the
antitrust
laws,
has
not
historically
and
today
they
do
not
believe
runs
--
raises
a
substantial
risk
of
interstate
conflict.
now,
as
to
the
specific
briefs
that
your
honor
referenced,
if
we
look
at
those
briefs
and
we
look
at
those
compared
to
what
happened
in
hartford
fire,
those
briefs
--
and
let's
focus
on
australia's
for
the
moment
because
that's
the
country
we
are
talking
about.
australia's
brief
essentially
says
they
have
a
regulatory
system
that
may
--
that
we
may
or
may
not
have
been
able
to
litigate
this
cause
of
action
in
australia,
but
let's
assume
that
we
could.
they
are
not
saying
--
they
did
not
say
in
that
brief
that
there
was
some
fundamental
conflict,
like
the
plurality
found
in
hartford
fire;
nor
did
they
say
that
there
was
the
kind
of
conflict
that
comes
up
in
the
application
of
403(h)
of
the
restatement,
which
justice
scalia
looked
to
in
his
opinion
in
hartford
fire.
so
there
is
not
the
kind
of
conflict
that
leads
necessarily
--
necessarily
--
to
not
reasonably
applying
the
statute.
the
reason
there's
not
is
that
because,
one,
there
is
not
a
rule
in
australia
that
one
has
to
abide
by
and
a
rule
in
the
united
states
that
one
has
to
abide
by
that
are
contradictory.
at
most,
what
you
have
is
you
have
a
clear
rule
in
the
united
states
that
says
thou
shalt
not
commit
fraud
in
florida
through
either
the
florida
through
either
--
for
or
in
interstate
commerce,
the
mails
or
through
an
exchange.
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
what
you
have
is
maybe
they
could
have
brought
suit
over
here
and
we
have
a
robust
regulatory
system
and
a
robust
litigation
system;
more
power
to
them.
but
that
doesn't
mean
--
saying
that,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
first
state
where
the
poison
candy
was
made
suddenly
has
no
interest
in
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
well,
let
me
deal
with
the
dragging
in
part
in
a
minute,
because
that's
subliminally
very
important
to
the
case.
but
let
me
address
the
direct
question.
the
australians
may
believe
that,
but
the
question
is
was
there
a
misrepresentation
both
in
the
united
states
and
possibly
in
australia?
if
there
was
in
australia,
that's
for
the
australians.
that's
dealing
with
the
effects
of
eating
the
poison
candy.
but
we
say
a
misrepresentation
was
made
in
the
united
states--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--sorry--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--we
have
joined--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--there
are
two
ways
to
connect
the
fraud
to
the
plaintiffs.
the
one
is
the
"in
connection
with"
requirement
that
deals
with
conduct,
which
we
meet,
and
this
court
has
construed
very
broadly
in
dabit,
in
zandford
and
any
other
number
of
cases.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
assuming
that
the
scope
of
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
conduct
in
florida,
we
then
get
to
the
second
question,
which
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
application
of
the
statute,
and
without
a
conflict,
we
would
then
look
at
--
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states
and
compare
them
to
the
australians.
and
the
australians
can
say,
we
can
--
you
know,
we
can
go
after
eating
that
poison
candy.
and
we
say,
fine,
if
you
want
to,
that's
great.
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
can't
go
after
the
act
of
poisoning
the
candy
in
florida.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
they--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--and
we
say
more
power
to
you,
you
can
decide
that
question.
the
question--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
question
is
should
there
be
deferral
in
this
case.
and
we
say
if
you
apply
the
standards
of
--
of
hartford
fire
or
the
standards
of
the
restatement,
you
don't
end
up
in
deferral.
you
end
up
in
prosecution
of
the
section
10(b)
cause
of
action
in
florida.
and
you
do
that
for
a
couple
of
different
reasons.
first,
you
look
at
the
magnitude
of
the
conduct
in
florida,
the
size
of
this.
this
is
a
$1.75
billion
writedown
in
a
portfolio.
you
have
a
portfolio
of
$187
billion
worth
of
mortgages
sitting
down
in
jacksonville,
florida.
those
are
all
mortgages
on
american
homes,
2
million
american
homes.
so,
this
is
not
just
australia,
australia,
australia.
that's
what's
in
the
portfolio
and
that's
what's
being
misrepresented.
and
when
they
doctor
the
numbers
and
send
them
to
australia,
it's
a
misrepresentation
of
that.
in
addition,
you
have
the
overarching
consideration
of
is
it
appropriate
to
sue
national
australia
bank
in
the
united
states
at
--
at
a
--
at
a
more
abstract
level?
and
the
answer
to
that,
we
submit,
is
yes.
they
have
invested
--
if
you
care
to
look,
it's
on
the
sa-11
and
sa-41
of
the
supplemental
appendix,
they
have
invest
--
they
have
$25
billion
worth
of
assets
here.
they
own
a
bank
in
michigan,
they
have
a
huge
trading
operation
on
park
avenue
that
trades
billions
of
dollars
in
derivatives
every
day.
this
is
not
the
situation
--
this
is
not
the
stereotype
of
a
gotcha
where
you
have--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--well,
they
are
only--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--they
are
only
at
issue
in
the
following
sense,
which
is
that
the
position
on
the
mortgage
servicing
rights
was
hedged
in
new
york.
when
the
hedge
came
undone,
there
were
losses
in
new
york
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge.
that
goes
to
the
point
of
were
there
any
affects
in
the
united
states,
because
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
on
that.
there
were
some
effects
here
from
the
hedge.
there
were
some
effects
on
--
in
the
adr
market,
but
we
are
not
--
we
are
not--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--disputing
that
most
of
the
effects
were
over
there.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
no,
your
honor.
he
was
the
holder
of
an
adr.
the
derivatives
come
in
because
they
are
the
activity
in
new
york
that
is
the
other
side
of
the
transaction.
homeside--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--that's
true.
there
--
there
are
no
americans
left.
this
is
strictly
australians.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
the
--
the
question
is,
were
there
effects
on
the
u.s.
market?
there
were
u.s.
investors
who
were,
in
all
likelihood,
harmed
but
none
have
stepped
forward
with
respect
to
adr
holders.
but
if
the
question
in
the
abstract
is
were
there
economic
effects
from
this
transaction
in
the
united
states,
the
answer
is
--
is
yes,
there
were
fallout
from
--
on
--
on
the
derivative
side,
which
is
the
other
side
--
which
was
the
other
side,
in
effect,
the
short
side
of
what
the
long
position
was,
which
was
$187
billion
worth
of
mortgages
in
florida
that
what
is
--
what
the
portfolio
consisted
of.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
well,
it
was
--
there
are
two
issues.
the
statute
was
intended
to
cover
that
kind
of
stuff
if
the
antecedent
of
"stuff"
is
fraud
in
florida.
now,
that's
a
separate
question
from
how
we
deal
with
the
private
right
of
action
in
these
circumstances.
now,
let's
back
up.
the
general
criticism
of
these
cases
is
that
they
are
gotcha
cases.
you
put
in
a
little
bit
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
private
bar
comes
and
attacks
you.
i
mean,
that's
the
stereotype.
well,
the
stereotype
is
wrong
and
it's
important
to
understand
why
the
stereotype
is
wrong.
because
if
all
you
have
is
a
very
modest
investment
in
the
adr
market,
1
percent
like
my
friends
from
nab,
those
cases
get
bounced
at
the
beginning
on
personal
jurisdiction
as
they
did
in
the
district
of
new
jersey
in
scors
and
the
novagold
case.
we
are
not
aware
of
any
case
where
if
all
you've
got
is
that
little
toehold
that
you
stay
in.
you
get
bounced
by
--
on
personal
jurisdiction.
and
to
pick
up
on
the
discussion
that
i
was
having
with
justice
ginsburg,
we
thought
that
in
addition
to
that,
if
the
court
wanted
to
send
signals
with
respect
to
these
kinds
of
cases,
if
you
put,
as
you
can,
sinochem
at
the
beginning
of
the
train,
even
more
of
these
cases
if
they
are
fallacious
are
going
to
be
screened
out
of
the
system.
so,
the
point
is
that
we
can
all
tell
our
australian
friends
that
there
are
very
rigid
safeguards
in
place
so
that
this
horror
story
in
reality
doesn't
happen
and
it
has
not
been
proven
to
happen.
it
is
an
attractive
myth,
but
it
hasn't
happened.
those
cases
go
out
and
they
go
out
early--
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
--i
do
know
that
and
let
me
answer
briefly,
because
i
want
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
i
disagree
with
your
fundamental
observation,
justice
kennedy.
these
cases
are
paid
attention
to
by
the
district
judges
and
they
go
out
early.
they
go
out
early
on
personal
jurisdiction;
there
is
not
a
lot
of
discovery
on
that.
they
go
out
early
--
if
sinochem
gets
applied
faithfully,
it
would
go
out
early
on
that
if
there
is
a
close
question.
and
then
you
go
to
the
12(b)(6).
and
pursuant
to
the
private
securities
litigation
reform
act,
one
of
the
purposes
of
that
is
no
discovery,
no
discovery
until
after
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
decided.
so
it
is
not
true
that
there
is
a
lot
of
discovery,
there
is
a
lot
of
transaction
costs,
before
we
know
the
answer
to
one
of
the
threshold
questions,
which
is:
should
this
case
be
in
our
system
or
not?
that
can
be
handled
and
it
is
being
handled
on
a
daily
basis,
notwithstanding,
you
know,
some
stereotypes.
now,
my
final
point
with
respect
to
professor
sachs'
articles
and
some
of
the
other
articles
is
they
in
effect
--
if
they
advocate
a
rule,
which
many
of
them
do,
which
it
should
be
limited
to
exchanges,
that
goes
back
to
my
threshold
point
of
the
scope
of
the
statute.
and
it
takes
an
eraser
to
the
statute
and
it
says:
it's
only
exchanges;
it's
not
in
connection
with
foreign
or
interstate
commerce
or
through
the
mails;
it's
limited,
contrary
to
the
express
words
of
the
statute,
in
a
way
that
the
statutory
construction
we
don't
believe
can
stand
it.
now,
there
are
other
legitimate
ways
of
cabining
the
private
cause
of
action.
but
that
--
if
you
are
faithful
to
the
statute,
we
submit
that
is
not
one
of
them.
mr.
thomas
a.
dubbs
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
begin
with
justice
alito's
question,
and
i
promise
to
get
back
to
judge
friendly
and
the
brooklyn
bridge.
as
to
--
we
have
alleged
that
in
--
that
effectively,
ministerial
activities
did
occur
here.
the
second
circuit
held,
interpreting
our
complaint,
that
the
numbers
were
mechanically
incorporated.
that's
as
close
to
ministerial
as
you
get.
we
used,
in
the
complaint,
the
were
"adopted".
we
said
that
they
were
asleep
at
the
wheel.
the
meaning
is
the
same,
but
the
--
there
were
no
checkpoints.
the
checkpoints
are
illusory.
if
there
was
a
checkpoint,
the
guard
was
asleep
at
the
checkpoint,
and
the
msr
number
went
right
through
the
checkpoint.
those
are
the
allegations,
and
we
should
be
able
to
stick
with
the
allegations.
now,
turning
to
the
statute,
my
colleague
indicated
that
the
language
with
respect
to
foreign
and
interstate
commerce
and
so
on,
based
on
the
aramco
decision,
was
boilerplate.
that's
wrong.
in
this
statute,
those
specific
statutory
approaches
towards
stopping
fraud
are
in
the
substance
of
the
statute.
they
are
not
in
the
jurisdictional
statute.
that's
important.
that's
why
that's
different.
as
to
the
leasco
example
and
bersch
example,
what
leasco
shows
is
a
long
chain
of
causation,
because
leasco
involved
an
american,
not
a
foreigner,
which
was
very
important
under
judge
friendly's
typology.
and
in
leasco,
you
have
this
extended
line
of
causation
beginning
with
representations
in
the
united
states
about
a
friendly,
tender
offer.
then
there
was
a
phone
call,
maybe
in
london,
maybe
in
the
united
states,
and
then
there
was
a
command
by
saul
steinberg
to
his
investment
bankers:
go
into
the
london
stock
exchange
and
start
to
buy.
that
extended
line
of
causation
would
not
pass
muster
under
the
direct
cause
test.
the
direct
cause
test
as
this
court
is
using
it
in
the
rico
area
under
cases
like
hemi,
that
would
not
pass
muster.
what
that
shows,
and
judge
friendly
said
that
if
you
have
a
foreign
plaintiff,
the
direct
cause
is
appropriate,
that
shows
that
the
direct
cause
test
is
narrower,
it's
a
screening
device,
and
it
limits
the
possibilities
when
you
have
a
foreign
plaintiff.
now,
that
is
a
proper
way
to
cabin
the
private
cause
of
action.
taking
an
eraser
to
the
statute
and
saying:
the
only
words
that
count
are
on
an
exchange,
doesn't
do
it
if
you
are
going
to
keep
a
linkage
between
the
private
cause
of
action
and
the
expressed
words
of
the
statute.
so
if
that
can't
do
it,
what
are
the
other
tools?
and
the
other
tools
are
the
direct
cause
test,
and
this
court
has
been
very
ably
working
through
some
of
these
difficult
fact
patterns
in
the
rico
area.
now,
in
this
case,
there
is
not
the
problem
that
there
is
in
hemi;
there
is
not
the
intervening
cause.
you
have
a
related
party,
nab,
that
may
or
may
not
be
involved
that
allegedly
is
broken
--
breaking
the
chain
of
causation.
it
is
--
has
to
be,
under
that
doctrine,
a
totally
third
party,
as
it
was
in
hemi,
where
you
have
the
state
of
new
york,
the
city
of
new
york
and
had
all
these
bouncing
balls
going
back
and
forth.
this
is
a
straight
shot
between
that
msr
being
fabricated
in
florida
and
going
on
to
the
financial
statements.
there
is
no
intervening
cause.
and
even
if
we
assume
that
in
some
senses,
it
was
normal
to
look
at
those
financial
statements,
that
in
and
of
--
of
itself
has
failed.
