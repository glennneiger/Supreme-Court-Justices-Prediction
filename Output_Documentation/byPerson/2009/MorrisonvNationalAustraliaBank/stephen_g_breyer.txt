justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
--
i
would
like
you
to
follow
that
up
specifically.
that
is,
in
my
mind
the
difficult
issue
in
this
case
is
not
the
jurisdictional
issue
under
principles
of
international
law.
it's
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
statute.
and
there
the
things
against
you
are
three.
one
is
professor
sachs's
argument,
which
i
would
like
to
know
your
answer
to.
the
second
is
in
judge
friendly's
two
opinions.
the
first
opinion
--
the
second
one,
rather,
bersch,
he
says
if
you
had
a
foreign
exchange
and
foreign
plaintiffs
as
--
and
there
was
no
foreign
plaintiff,
the
security
issued
over
a
foreign
exchange,
even
if
that
fraud
takes
place
totally
in
the
united
states,
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
it.
that's
friendly,
which
started
this.
and
the
third
thing
is
what
he
says
in
leasco.
he
says:
we
cannot
see
any
sound
reason
for
not
taking
your
position,
at
least
for
the
plaintiffs
who
are
americans.
okay?
now,
france,
britain
and
australia
have
filed
briefs
in
this
case
giving
what
they
consider
very
sound
reasons,
which
are
reasons
that
judge
friendly
never
considered.
and
those
three
reasons,
as
we
know,
is
they
point
to
a
number
of
conflicts,
that
if
you
win,
how
that
will
interfere
with
their
efforts
to
regulate
their
own
securities
markets,
right?
that's
all
one
question:
professor
sachs,
friendly
in
bersch,
and
friendly
in
leasco.
but
that's
what
i'd
like
to
hear
your
answers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
--
do
you
want
to
finish?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
--
i
mean,
i
can
see.
i
will
give
you
all
that.
that
isn't
what
is
bothering
me.
i
think
you
are
right
so
far
as
what
you
have
argued.
but
the
part
that
i
think
is
most
difficult
is
why
i
--
i
shorthand
referred
to
professor
sachs'
article.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
what
australia
is
actually
saying
is
what
we
don't
like
about
--
about
the
american
system,
you
know,
their
--
their
common
criticisms
of
class
actions.
we
say,
first
of
all,
the
american
rule
means
even
if
our
companies
here
are
right,
that
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
their
legal
fees.
we
don't
like
punitive
damages.
we
don't
like
that
we
have
the
opt-out.
and
these
are
all
our
citizens,
and
we
don't
want
to
subject
our
companies
on
our
exchange
to
that
stuff.
now,
fine,
they
have
a
reason
on
their
side.
then
professor
sachs
says:
read
the
statute,
because
they
argue
--
it
was
never
intended
to
cover
that
kind
of
stuff.
now,
that's
what
i
would
like
you
to
address
specifically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me
reasons
for
it.
the
strongest
one
for
it,
the
strongest
example
against
you
it
seems
to
me,
is
judge
friendly's
example.
schmidt,
a
citizen
of
germany,
flies
to
new
york
and
meets
jones
in
the
hotel.
and
jones
says,
i
have
a
bridge
i
want
to
sell
you.
look
out
the
window.
say,
do
you
own
the
brooklyn
bridge?
yes.
and
that's
a
lie.
here's
what
you
do.
you
invest
in
buying
shares
of
my
company
sold
on
the
german
exchange.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
conduct
took
place
in
the
united
states,
a
terrible
fraud.
this
is
contrary
to
fraud
and,
says,
i
think,
judge
friendly
and
others,
it
should
apply
at
least
where
schmidt
is
an
american
citizen
and
professor
sachs
says
no,
not
even
then.
what
do
you
do
with
that
case?
the
fraud
took
place
totally
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sign
the
paper
here
in
new
york.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sign
the
paper,
right
here,
and
give
me
the
money,
because
i
have
an
urgent
appointment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
your
position
and
hers
is:
that's
no
more
a
valid
claim
than
this
one
or
any
other
one
we
dream
up.
that's
why
it's
a
pure
example,
and
i
want
to
know
how
you
feel
about
it.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
any
other.
or
--
read
the
next
word.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
hurt
the
other
countries
if
what
we
would
say
on
their
reading
of
this
is,
congress
has
said,
"look,
if
some
terribly
bad
conduct
happens
in
the
united
states;
they
lie
through
their
teeth;
and
you,
whoever
you
are
in
the
world,
who
buys
some
shares
and
as
a
result
you
are
hurt,
we
will
give
you
a
remedy.
"
"come
to
us.
"
--now,
how
does
that
hurt
australia?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
france
or
england
or
any
of
these
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
not
as
easy
to
apply
this,
you
think?
now,
on
your
theory,
i
guess
schmidt
is
in
germany
and
we
have
our
brooklyn
bridge.
okay,
now
wait.
what
happens
is
he
calls
schmidt
on
the
telephone,
jones,
and
he
says
i
own
the
brooklyn
bridge.
actual,
right,
direct?
under
your
test,
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
schmidt
is
in
germany.
he
calls
him
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
--
everything
--
you
have
to
assume
he's
going
to
buy
the
thing
on
the
exchange
in
germany
but
the
fraud
is
in
brooklyn.
he
is
lying
about
--
he
doesn't
really
own
the
brooklyn
bridge.
so
he
calls
schmidt.
i
am
interested
in
--
he
calls
schmidt.
causation,
that's
what
your
last
pages
of
your
brief,
focus
on
that.
he
calls
him
and
he
lies
to
him.
actual.
in
your
theory--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
[laughter]
go
back
to
my
brooklyn
bridge
example.
everything
is
hatched
in
your
boiler
room.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
communicate
the
lie
by
calling
schmidt
in
berlin
on
the
telephone,
directly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
looking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
i'm
focusing
on
the
last
pages
of
your
brief.
where
you
turn
this
whole
thing
on
the
directness
of
the
causation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
accepting
that
for
the
moment.
what's
bothering
me,
taking
off
from
what
the
chief
justice
said,
is
the
feasibility
of
your
test.
your
test,
it
seems
to
me
on
causation,
would
say
that
when
you
phone
schmidt
and
lie
to
him,
he
can
sue.
but
when
you
phone
your
parent
company,
knowing
that
they
will
put
it
in
the
prospectus
and
schmidt
will
read
it,
you
can't
sue.
and
then
what
occurs
to
me
is
suppose
you
phoned
a
reporter,
or
suppose
you
phoned
your
parent
company
and
you
knew
they
would
tell
a
reporter.
i'm
focusing
on
the
practicality
of
your
causation
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
that's
the
question
here?
you
think
the
question
is
whether
this
really
took
place
in
florida?
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
skip
--
skip
my
question
because
other
people
may
ask.
