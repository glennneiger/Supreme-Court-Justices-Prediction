anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
it
happens
in
advance
of
considerable
discovery.
i
--
i
--
i
would
agree
that
the
judge
can
confine
discovery
to
forum
non
conveniens
or
for
personal
jurisdiction,
but
in
--
in
these
cases
one
of
the
things
we
are
really
talking
about
is
the
burden
of
discovery.
that's
the
cost
of
litigation.
you
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
government
going
to
tell
us
that
its
test,
which
differs
from
the
foreign
exchange
test,
is
based
on
considerations
like
those
suggested
in
justice
breyer's
brooklyn
bridge
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
limitations
on
discovery
give
you
substantial
protection
were
we
to
adopt
the
government's
test
or
say
the
foreign
exchange
test
with
the
subset
exceptions
for
the
--
that
takes
account
of
the
government's
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
a
consideration
that
this
discovery
alone
would
be
an
offense
to
foreign--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
there
were
litigation
with
substantial
allegations
of
wire
fraud
violations
as
predicate
for
rico
violations,
and
the
case
begins
to
proceed,
and
then
there
is
a
second
cause
of
action
under
the
securities
law.
would
--
would
the
fact
that
there
is
going
to
be
discovery
and
substantial
litigation
in
the
--
in
the
united
states
courts
be
a
factor
in
retaining
the
--
the
securities
violation
in
this
suit?
or
would
the
test
be
just
the
same
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you
give
no
weight
to
the
fact
that
it
was
on
the
australian
exchange?
