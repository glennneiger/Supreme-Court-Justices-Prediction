mr.
david
d.
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
as-applied
challenge
asks
whether
the
government
can
make
it
a
crime
for
ralph
fertig
and
the
humanitarian
law
project
to
speak
in
association
with
the
kurdistan
workers
party.
specifically,
they
seek
to
advocate
for
legal
reform
in
congress
and
the
un,
to
write
and
distribute
articles
supportive
of
kurdish
rights,
to
inform
the
kurds
of
their
international
human
rights
and
remedies,
and
to
advise
them
on
peaceful
conflict
resolution.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
kurdistan
workers
party
engages
in
a
wide
range
of
lawful
activities
and
that
plaintiffs
seek
to
support
only
lawful
ends.
the
government
has
a
concededly
compelling
interest
in
combatting
terrorism,
yet
it
has
not
even
tried
to
defend
these
prohibitions
under
strict
scrutiny.
instead,
it
rests
its
entire
case
on
the
proposition
that
criminalizing
plaintiffs'
speech
is
a
regulation
of
conduct,
not
speech,
and
therefore
can
be
upheld
under
o'brien.
that
view
is
mistaken
for
two
fundamental
reasons.
first,
as
this
court
has
already
held,
o'brien
is
inapplicable
where
the
government
prohibits
pure
speech--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--some
of
my
clients'
speech?
mr.
david
d.
cole
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
any
of
it
could
be
prohibited,
your
honor,
unless
the
government
can
satisfy
the
stringent
scrutiny
that
this
court
applies
when
congress
seeks
to
prohibit
pure
speech.
so,
no,
i
don't
--
i--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
think
that
certainly
all
of
the
speech
that
i've
just
identified,
which
is
the
core--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
yes.
it's
core
--
and
i
think
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
it
is
core
political
speech
on
issues
of
public
concern.
it
is
advocating
only
lawful,
peaceable
activities.
this
court
has
never
upheld
the
criminal
prohibition
of
lawful
speech
on
issues
of
public
concern.
mr.
david
d.
cole
i
think
money
is
different,
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
cole
i
think
money
is
different
because
it's
--
it's
conduct,
not
speech.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
and
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
answer
is
no,
for
the
--
unless
the
government
can
meet
the
higher
standard
of
scrutiny
that
applies
when
you're
regulating
speech.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
necessarily
be
brandenburg.
i
think
for
--
in
order
to
apply
--
to
decide
this
case,
your
honor,
all
the
court
has
to
find
is
that
when
the
speech
advocates
solely
lawful,
peaceable
activities
of
the
sort
advocated
here,
that's
not
sufficient.
i
think
specific
--
we've
suggested
a
specific
intent
standard,
which
is
lower
than
brandenburg,
would
be
appropriate--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
again,
your
honor,
that
--
if
the
government
--
if
the
connection
between
the
speech
and
the
government's
concern
were
sufficiently
close,
then
maybe
it
could.
but
the
problem--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
think
the
test
is
whether
the
--
whether
the
speech
--
when
it's
speech,
i
think
the
test
is
whether
the
speech
has
been
provided
with
specific
intent
or
knowledge
that
it
will
further
unlawful,
terrorist
ends
of
the
group.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
well,
two
answers.
does
your
question
refer
to
the
nazi
party
today
or
the
nazi
party
during
world
war
ii?
mr.
david
d.
cole
okay.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right,
right.
so
i
think
--
the
reason
i
ask,
your
honor,
is
that
it
may
make
a
difference
if
we
are
at
war.
the
law
of
treason
prohibits
aid--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--okay.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
well,
i
think
all
the
court
held
in
regan
and
zemel
was
that
it
is
permissible
for
the
government
to
regulate
conduct
--
not
speech
--
travel,
and
economic
transactions,
not
speech.
those
were
essentially
o'brien
cases.
and,
in
fact,
in
regan
the
court
distinguished
a
prohibition
on
travel
to
cuba
across
the
board
from
a
prohibition
directed
at
a
group,
the
communist
party,
in
the
kent
and
aptheker
cases,
where
the
court
held
that--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right,
your
honor.
but
that
--
but
that's
essentially
an
o'brien
situation.
the
prohibition
is
on
a
conduct,
whether
it's
draft
card
burning
or
travel.
the
individual
who
seeks
to
engage
in
that
conduct
says,
i
want
to
do
it
for
speech
purposes.
but
the
court
says
the
government
has
a
freer
hand
in
regulating
conduct
than
speech,
and,
therefore,
as
long
as
you're
regulating
the
non-expressive
element
of
the
conduct,
we'll
apply
o'brien.
but
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
when--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--from
meeting?
no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
then,
if
it's
--
if
it's
traveling
for
the
purpose
of
association,
then
it
would
be
targeted
at
association,
not
at
the
conduct
of
travel.
the
whole--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no,
but
the
whole
point
of
the
cuba
--
the
cuba
travel
cases
is
that
--
again,
as
this
court
said,
it
was
an
across-the-board
ban.
it
did
not
apply
to
different
political
groups.
it
applied
to
anyone
who
sought
to
travel
to
cuba.
and
it
was
about
travel.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
well,
then
i
think
--
i
think
that's
--
that's
different
from
this
case,
right,
because
this
case
--
suppose
it's
a
ban
on
speech
wherever
it
occurs.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
well,
with
respect
to
the
hypothetical,
i
think
the
question,
your
honor,
would
be
whether
the
government's
interest
in
banning
that
travel
is
unrelated
to
the
associational
or
speech
purposes.
mr.
david
d.
cole
there's
no
--
there's
no
dispute,
your
honor,
that
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
in
cutting
off
aid
to
terrorism.
the
question
is
whether
it
can
do
so
by
criminalizing
pure
speech.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right,
but,
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
don't
--
i
think
it's
not
in
this
--
in
this
sense,
justice
scalia.
imagine
a
statute
that
banned
aid
to
overthrow
the
united
states
government.
and
it
had
three
provisions:
one,
you
can't
assassinate
the
president;
two,
you
can't
provide
bombs
and
weapons
to
groups
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government;
three,
you
can't
advocate
overthrow
of
the
government.
if
that
were
applied
to
someone
for
speaking
in
advocacy,
we
wouldn't
say
it's
a
regulation
of
speech.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
but--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
the
government
says
if
they
--
even
if
they
speak
in
conjunction
with
the
group,
they
--
and
they're
providing
a
benefit
to
the
government,
that's
prohibited.
so,
for
example--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--so,
for
example,
under
that
view,
the
new
york
times,
the
washington
post,
and
the
l.a.
times,
all
of
which
published
op-eds
by
hamas
spokespersons
--
hamas
is
on
the
list
--
thereby
providing
a
benefit
to
hamas,
working
with
the
hamas
spokesperson,
they're
all
criminals.
president
carter--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--but--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right,
and,
your
honor,
there's
no--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
it
is,
though.
it
is,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it's
--
ralph
fertig
is
not
the
new
york
times,
and
he's
not
president
carter,
but
it's
the
same
sort
of
support,
right?
president
carter--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no,
but
it's
not
about
--
it's
not
about
whether
you
meet
with
them.
it's
about
whether
you
coordinate
with
them,
and
they've
certainly
coordinated
with
the
hamas
spokesperson
in
editing
and
accepting
and
then
publishing
his
editorial.
that
is
--
that
would
be
providing
a
service.
it
would--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
let
me
--
let
me
also
answer
it
this
way,
justice
scalia:
if
you
look
at
the
specific
speech
which
our
clients
seek
to
engage
in,
it
includes
writing
and
distributing
literature
in
conjunction
with
the
kurdistan
workers
party
in
the
united
states
advocating
their
support.
how
is
that
different
from
the
new
york
times?
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
i
think
--
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
specifically
intend
and
know
that
your
aid
will
further
the
group
in
its
terrorist
activities,
then
it's
not
protected
speech.
but
if
you're
--
if
you
don't
know
that
and
you
don't
intend
that,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
justice
alito,
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge.
so
the
question
simply
is
whether
training
in
what
international
human
rights
consist
of,
in
how
to
advocate
for
international
human
rights,
and
how
to
advocate
politically
in
congress
and
other
bodies.
that's
the
speech
that's
at
issue
here.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no,
i
was
just--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no.
i
think
--
i
think,
again,
it
depends
upon
the
form
of
speech.
there
may
be
some
forms
of
training
that
are
so
closely
connected
to
the
--
to
the
end
that
congress
seeks
to
--
legitimately
seeks
to
proscribe,
like
training
in
bombmaking
or
training
in
military
exercises.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
well,
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
the
argument
that
the
united
states
made
to
this
court
in
scales.
and
here
i'm
quoting
from
the
government's
brief:
"active
membership
can
be
proscribed
even
though
the
activity
be
expended
along
lines
not
otherwise
illegal,
since
active
support
of
any
kind
aids
the
organization
in
achieving
its
own
illegal
purposes.
"
that
was
with
respect
to
an
organization
that
congress
spent
10
years
studying,
made
findings
that
it
was
an
international
conspiracy
directed
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union
with
the
aim
of
overthrowing
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence,
using
terrorism.
and,
nonetheless,
this
court
in
scales
held
you've
got
to
distinguish
between
that
aid
and
support
and
membership
which
is
furthering
the
lawful
activities
and
that
which
is
furthering
the
illegal
activities;
otherwise
you
are
penalizing
the
exercise
of
lawful
speech.
the
court
said
the
same
thing
in
de
jonge.
mr.
david
d.
cole
it
did,
justice
ginsburg,
but
only
because
it
interpreted
the
statute
to
be
--
to
be
limited
to
specific
--
to
members
--
active
membership
that
is
specifically
intended
to
further
the
illegal
ends
of
the
group,
precisely--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
i
--
right,
but--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
two
things
in
response
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
first,
that
is
what
the
united
states
argued
in
scales.
and,
again,
the
court,
not
only
in
scales
but
in
a
host
of
cases
striking
down
communist
party
statute,
said
you
have
to
distinguish
between
aid
that's
intended
to
further
lawful
activity
and
aid
that's
intended
to
further
illegal
activity
when
it's
in
the
form
of
protected
activity
--
association,
here
speech
and
association.
and,
secondly--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--active
membership--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--which
the
government
says
constitutes
more
than
mere
nominal
membership.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
your
honor,
in
de
jonge,
one
of
these
cases,
one
of
this
court's
first
first
amendment
cases,
the
government
argued
that
mr.
de
jonge
aided
the
communist
party
in
its
illegal
ends
by
conducting
a
meeting
for
them
and
being
their
lead
speaker
at
the
meeting.
and
this
court
said:
we've
got
to
look
at
what
he
did,
and
what
--
yes,
he
conducted
the
meeting;
yes,
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party;
yes,
he
solicited
people
to
join
the
communist
party.
but
what
did
he
do?
he
advocated
lawful
peaceable
activities.
and
this
court
said--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
don't
think
it
would--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right,
but
your
honor,
what
would
--
if
congress
came
along
after
the
communist
party
cases
and
said,
okay,
you've
said
we
can't
make
it
a
crime
to
criminalize
membership
in
the
communist
party;
we
are
now
going
to
make
it
a
crime
to
speak
in
conjunction
with
the
communist
party
--
do
you
think
the
decisions
would
have
come
out
any
differently?
i
don't
think
so,
because
this
court
has
said
that
speech
is
different
from
money,
that
it--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--your
honor,
this
--
this
court
accepted
congress's
findings.
congress's
findings
were
not
that
this
was
a
philosophical
debating
society,
but
that
it
was
an
international
criminal
conspiracy
directed
by
our
enemy
to
overthrow
us
through
terrorism.
mr.
david
d.
cole
oh,
sure--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
--
i
don't
think
that's
fair,
justice
scalia.
the
humanitarian
law
project
has
no
interest
in
furthering
terrorism,
but
the
kurdistan
workers
party
are
the
principal
representatives
of
the
--
of
the
kurds
in
turkey.
they
do
have
an
interest
in
protecting
the
rights
of
the
kurds.
they
do
have
an
interest
in
encouraging
the
kurdistan
workers
party
to
--
to
disavow
violence
and
engage
in
lawful
peaceful
means
of
resolving
their
disputes--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--yes.
we
didn't
actually
concede
that,
your
honor.
that's
a
misstatement
on
the
part
of
the
government.
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
what
we
said,
for
the
record,
is
that
it
would
pose
a
very
different
constitutional
question.
and
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
it
might
pose
a
different
constitutional
question.
one
is
--
and
that
was
--
i'm
picking
up
on
my
question
back
to
mr.
chief
justice,
is
it
during
wartime
or
not?
and
during
wartime,
congress
has
broader
powers
pursuant
to
the
treason--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
think
it
might
be
different
if
we
were
at
war
with
these
groups.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well
--
well,
two
things,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
--
it
might
be
different
if
you
--
if
you're
talking
about
treason.
tokyo
rose,
for
example,
was
engaged
in
speech,
but
she
was
doing
so
with
--
with
the
purpose
of
aiding
the
enemy
and
the
specific
intent
of
betraying
the
united
states.
and
that's
what's
required.
and
what
the
supreme
court
has
said
is
that
the
--
the
aid
has
to
be
to--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--yes.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
i
think
it
would
depend,
your
honor,
because
the
--
what
--
what
treason
requires
is
aid
to
the
enemy,
and
aid
might
be
in
the
form
of
speech.
but
it
also
requires
a
specific
intent
to
betray
the
united
states.
and
when
you
aid
someone
with
whom
we
are
at
war,
there
is
an
--
there
may
well
be
an
intent
to
betray
the
united
states.
there
is
no
betrayal
of
the
united
states
here.
and,
number
two--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
think
the
question,
your
honor,
is
there
--
is
there
any
realistic
nexus
between
writing
an
op-ed,
advocating
before
congress,
urging
a
group
to
use
lawful
nonviolent
means
to
resolve
its
disputes,
and
killing
americans?
and
there
just
isn't.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
and
--
and
--
and
i
guess
my
answer
to
that
would
be
it
would
depend
upon
whether
the
--
the
--
what
is
being
prohibited
is
speech.
if
what
is
being
prohibited
is
speech,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
government
to
say
we're
going
to
criminalize
your
speech,
even
though
it's
advocating
lawful
activities,
because--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that's
right.
and
--
and
that's
exactly
what
de
jonge
was
essentially
charged
with.
and
the
communist
party
was,
again,
found
to
be
engaged
in
criminal
activity,
to
be
a
criminal
syndicate,
essentially,
by
the
oregon
statute.
the
court
didn't
question
that.
at
that
time
it
was
illegal
to
even
advocate
illegal
activity.
he
was
charged
with
providing
his
person,
personnel,
by
conducting
a
meeting
under
the
auspices
of
the
communist
party
and
providing
the
lead
speech
there.
and
the
court
said,
even
though
the
argument
was--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
--
again,
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge
with
respect
to
the
particular
speech
that
our
clients
seek
to
engage
in,
so
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
require
the
court
to
decide
whether
any
nonspeech
assistance
could
be
proscribed.
in
fact--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
if
--
if
that
were
what
they
were
doing,
your
honor,
if
it
was
teaching,
then
it
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
but
if
--
i
took
chief
justice
roberts's
question--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no,
no.
i--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no.
justice
sotomayor,
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
number
one,
the
statute
regulates
speech.
it
regulates
speech
because
of
what
it
conveys.
therefore,
the--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--yes.
mr.
david
d.
cole
yes.
exactly.
and
that's--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
answer
--
maybe
i
wasn't
clear
in
responding
to
justice
alito.
but
with
respect
to
speech
advocating
solely
lawful
activity
of
the
type
at
issue
here,
i
think
the
connection
between
the
government's--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--all
right.
well,
i--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
i
think
the
question
--
the
question
at
the
--
at
the
--
at
the
bottom
would
be
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
connection
between
the
speech
which
is
being
expressed
and
the
government's
compelling
interest.
and
if
--
certainly
there
would
be
if
it's
--
meets
brandenburg.
i
think
there
might
be
if
it
is
specifically
intended
or
known
that
it
will
further
terrorist
activity.
but
where
--
with
respect
to
our
speech,
there's
really
no
realistic
likelihood
that
the
speech
that's
being
expressed
here
will
further--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
federal
election--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--federal
election
commission
v.
wisconsin
right
to
life
was
a
pre-enforcement,
as-applied
challenge
to
the
provisions
of
the
bcra.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
david
d.
cole
oh,
i'm
sorry
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
i
thought
i
was,
and
maybe
--
but
the
answer
would
be
we
are
in
a
military
conflict
with
the
al-qaeda
and
the
taliban.
this
court
has
recognized
that.
it's
authorized
by
the
authorization
to
use
military
force.
therefore,
treason
law
might
be
applicable,
number
one.
number
two,
it's
not
clear
that
the
al-qaeda
engages
in
any
lawful
activities
at
all,
and
the
--
the
principle
this
court
established
with
respect
to
the
communist
party,
a
group
that
clearly
engaged
in
illegal
activities
of
a
very,
very
dangerous
kind,
but
also
engaged
in
lawful
activities,
is
that
that's
--
that
that
the
group
has
to
be
a
dual-purpose
group.
and
here
there's
absolutely
no
dispute
that
the
kurdistan
workers
party
and
the
ltte
engage
in
a
wide
variety
of
lawful
activities
and
that
all
our
clients
seek
to
do
is
support
those
lawful
activities.
thank
you.
mr.
david
d.
cole
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
start
by
addressing
the
question
of
strict
scrutiny.
the
--
the
--
justice
kennedy,
you
asked,
and
a
number
of
the
justices
asked,
doesn't
it
make
a
difference
that
what
they've
done
is
prohibited
a
wide
range
of
conduct
and
just
some
of
that
is
speech?
well,
that's
precisely
an
accurate
description
of
the
breach
of
the
peace
statute
in
cohen
v.
california.
it
forbade
breaches
of
peace
through
loud
noises,
through
horse
racing
in
the
streets,
through
any
kind
of
offensive
conduct.
but
when
california
applied
that
statute
to
the
words
on
mr.
cohen's
jacket
and
then
argued
because
we
are
not
interested
in
the
words
on
his
jacket,
we
are
interested
in
preserving
the
peace,
however
it's
breached,
o'brien
should
apply,
the
court
said
no.
we
deal
here
with
the
conviction
resting
solely
upon
speech,
not
upon
any
separately
identifiable
conduct.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no.
well,
the
government
doesn't
object
because
there
are
actually
many
cases,
and
fec
v.
wisconsin
right
to
life
is
only
the
most
recent.
but,
again,
the
notion
is
somebody
who
is
told
you
can
meet
with
a
group,
you
can
discuss
with
a
group
--
in
fact,
the
house
report
says
that
you
are
free
to
speak
with
and
on
behalf
of
a
designated
group.
but
then
you
have
a
statute
that
says,
if
you
advocate
in
any
coordinated
way,
if
you
tell
them
anything
that's
derived
from
specialized
knowledge,
if
you
tell
them
anything
of
specific
skill,
you're
--
you're
engaged
in
a
crime
and
you
could
go
to
jail
for
15
years.
that's
why
the
humanitarian
law
project
came
to
me.
they
said:
we've
been
doing
this
kind
of
lawful
activity.
we
think
it's
our
right,
but
we're
not
going
to
risk
going
to
jail
for
15
years
to
do
it.
the
government
has
spent
a
decade
arguing
that
our
clients
cannot
advocate
for
peace,
cannot
inform
about
international
human
rights.
mr.
david
d.
cole
if
o'brien
applies,
then
i
think
the
court
would
still
be
applying
the
scrutiny
that
asks,
is
there
a
reasonable
fit
--
is
there
a
reasonable
fit
between
the
specific
speech
that's
at
issue
here,
speech
on
issues
of
public
concern,
advocating
only
lawful
activity,
and
the
--
and
that
the
government
legitimately
seeks
to
further,
which
is
stopping
support
for
terrorism?
now--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
the
lower
courts
struck--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
the--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no,
and,
in
fact,
the
government
has
never
even
attempted
to
defend
the
statute
under
strict
scrutiny,
because
i
think
it
clearly
could
not
satisfy
strict
scrutiny.
and
under
this
--
under
cohen,
strict
scrutiny
is
what
must
be
applied
here.
in
addition--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand
for
--
for
application
of
strict
scrutiny
if
you
read
it
that
o'brien
doesn't
apply.
o'brien
also
doesn't
apply
if
the
statute
is
not
content
neutral.
this
is
a
statute
that
doesn't
bar
all
aid;
it
doesn't
even
bar
all
speech.
it
permits
unlimited
provision
of
religious
materials,
even
if
they
advocate
jihad,
but
proscribes
any
secular
material,
even
if
they
are
advocating
peace.
so
--
so
there
are
--
the
--
the
lower
court,
again,
found
that
the
statute
was
vague,
that
our
clients
were
reasonably
chilled,
that
they
had
a
right
to
engage
in
this
activity.
i
think
you
can
reach
that
result
either
through
vagueness,
or
you
can
reach
it
by
applying
strict
scrutiny,
or
i
think
because
the
fit
is
so
poor
here,
and
because
--
and
the
vagueness,
in
fact,
undermines
the
fit,
because
people
are
chilled
from
engaging
even
in
speech
that
the
government
doesn't
want
to
prohibit.
all
right,
if
i
am
told
you
--
you
--
you'll
go
to
jail
if
you
tell
them
anything
that's
derived
from
special--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
well,
one
--
well,
we're
not
--
we're
not
teaching
them
how
to
get
money.
we're
seeking
to
teach
them
how
to
advocate
for
lawful
human
rights
or--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
that
--
that
claim
has
been
mooted
because
the
ltte
is
no
longer
--
has
no
role
in
sri
lanka.
so
what's
left
is
solely
--
has
nothing
to
do
with
money.
secondly,
congress
only
made
a
finding
about
money.
at
the
same
time
that
it
made
a
finding
that
money
is
fungible,
it
said
this
is
a
statute
--
and
this
is
from
the
house
report
--
only
affects
one's
contribution
of
financial
and
material
resources
and
does
not
prohibit
speaking
in
concert
with
and
on
behalf
of
designated
groups.
well,
that
suggests
that
congress
thought
that
what
our
clients
want
to
do
is
--
should
be
protected.
mr.
david
d.
cole
and
we
have
suggested
that
you
should,
therefore,
interpret
the
statute
in
--
consistent
with
that.
thank
you.
