ms.
elena
kagan
with
your
permission,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
may
take
some
time.
[laughter]
i'm
sure
it
will
on
the
other
side,
too.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
material
support
statute
is
a
vital
weapon
in
this
nation's
continuing
struggle
against
international
terrorism.
the
statute
prohibits,
in
terms
that
ordinary
people
can
understand,
the
provision
of
material
resources,
material
resources
of
all
kinds,
to
foreign
groups
that
engage
in
terrorist
acts
that
threaten
the
security
of
the
united
states
or
its
citizens.
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
in
any
way
petitioners'
independent
advocacy.
petitioners
can
say
or
write
whatever
they
wish
about
the
pkk
or
the
ltte,
and
all
their
activities
both
legal
and
illegal.
what
petitioners--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
sotomayor,
if
--
if
there
are--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
excluded
from
the
statute
--
should
be
excluded
from
the
statute,
and
indeed
even
petitioners
have
never
suggested--
ms.
elena
kagan
--because
i
think
that
there
the
canon
of
constitutional
avoidance
would
clearly
come
into
play.
if
there
is
a
criminal
defendant,
even
a
civil
defendant
where
there
may
be
sixth
amendment
issues,
where
there
may
be
due
process
issues,
it
would--
ms.
elena
kagan
--it
can--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
statute--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
statute
cannot
legitimately
be
read
to
--
to
include
their
independent
advocacy.
but
the
statute,
in
fact,
does
not
cover
their
independent
advocacy.
judge
fertig
and
all
the
rest
of
the
petitioners
can
lobby
congress,
can
lobby
international
organizations--
ms.
elena
kagan
--as
they
see
fit.
ms.
elena
kagan
again,
the
statute--
ms.
elena
kagan
--again,
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
petitioners
from
petitioning
peacefully.
what
the
statute
does
is
to
prohibit
petitioners
from
giving
support
to
foreign
terrorist
organizations
in
their
ability
to
petition
international
organizations.
and
that's
a
very
different
thing.
it's
a
different
thing
for
several
reasons.
first,
remember
that
these
are
foreign
organizations,
and
as
several
of
you
have
suggested,
the
ability
of
congress
and
of
the
executive
branch
to
regulate
the
relationships
between
americans
and
foreign
governments
or
foreign
organization
has
long
been
acknowledged
by
this
court.
it
was
acknowledged
in
cases
like
regan
and
zemel
and
others,
not
only
with
respect
to
nations
with
which
we
are
at
war,
but
with
respect
to
foreign
nations
and
other
entities
as
well
--
foreign
nationals.
and
in
fact,
the
petitioners'
supposed
first
amendment
claims
really
are
not
speech
claims
at
all.
they
are
all
association
claims.
petitioners
can
do
whatever
independent
advocacy
they
wish.
what
petitioners
cannot
do
is
to
provide
support
to
a
foreign
terrorist
organization.
and
there,
indeed,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
association
clause
does
not
extend
that
far
to
give
americans,
american
citizens,
the
ability
to
deal
in
whatever
way
they
wish
with
foreign
nations--
ms.
elena
kagan
--or
foreign
organizations.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
ginsburg,
you're
exactly
right
that,
in
addition
to
engaging
in
independent
advocacy,
petitioners
can
meet
with
members
of
the
foreign
terrorist
organizations,
can
join
the
foreign
terrorist
organizations,
that
membership
is
not
prohibited
by
the
statute.
what
the
statute
does
prohibit
is
active
support
of
all
kinds,
both
material--
ms.
elena
kagan
--absolutely,
justice
kennedy.
if
--
if
judge
fertig
or
the
other
petitioners
wanted
to
say
to
these
organizations,
you
should
change
your
ways,
nothing
in
the
statute--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
kennedy,
i
want
first
--
i'm
going
to
answer
your
question,
and
i'm
going
to
say
that
that's
still
not
covered,
but
i
want
also
to
make
a
general
point,
which
is
that
this
court
can
exhaust
all
the
hypotheticals
that
it
has
in
this
case,
and
it
will
be
irrelevant
to
the
case
at
hand,
and
that
would
be
so
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
with
respect
to
overbreadth,
all
of
those
uncertain
or
even
unconstitutional
applications
will
be
but
a
thimbleful,
compared
to
the
ocean
full
of
completely
legitimate
applications
of
this
statute.
and,
second,
because
those
hypotheticals
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
cole
said
several
times,
i
heard,
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge,
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
court
thinks
that
there
are
certain
categories
of
activity
that
the
statute
could
not
prohibit
that
would
raise
serious
constitutional
concerns
--
which
i
must
say
i
--
i
disagree
with,
but
there
may
be
some.
to
the
extent
that
that's
true,
the
court
can
--
can
put
those
off
to
another
day,
another--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
objection
is
exactly
what
justice
kennedy
suggested
with
his
hypothetical,
because
his
hypothetical
is
actually
perfectly
aligned
with
this
case.
you
can't
give
tsunami
aid,
but
the
question
is:
can
you
instruct
these
organizations
about
how
to
get
tsunami
aid?
and
then
these
organizations
get
tsunami
aid,
and
they,
in
fact,
use
that
aid
in
such
a
way
that
they
also
have
more
money
to--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
that
something,
which
is
the
teaching
the
foreign
terrorist
organization
how
to
petition
international
bodies
in
order
to
get
various
kinds
of
support,
financial
or
otherwise,
that
will
strengthen
those
organizations
in
everything
that
they
do.
what
congress
decided--
ms.
elena
kagan
--congress
was
the
reasonable
person
here.
and
congress
reasonably
decided
that
when
you
help
a
terrorist
--
foreign
terrorist
organization's
legal
activities,
you're
also
helping
the
foreign
terrorist
organization's
illegal
activities.
hezbollah
builds
bombs.
hezbollah
also
builds
homes.
what
congress
decided
was
when
you
help
hezbollah
build
homes,
you
are
also
helping
hezbollah
build
bombs.
that's
the
entire
theory
behind
this
statute,
and
it's
a
reasonable
theory
for
exactly
the
kinds
of
reasons
that
justice
kennedy
was
suggesting
by
that
hypothetical.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
--
i
actually
don't
think
--
i
mean,
congress
clearly
did
not
mean
to
include
that.
and
i
think
that
the
normal
words
that
congress
used
make
that
pretty
clear.
when
you
think
about
personnel,
when
you
think
about
training,
when
you
think
about
expert
advice
and
assistance,
even
when
you
think
about
service,
you
--
the
notion
that
i
am
serving
a
terrorist
organization
simply
by
the
act
of
membership
i
think
would
not
be
correct.
and--
ms.
elena
kagan
--that
is
certainly
not
the
way
the
government
reads
the
statute,
and
that's
not
the
way
the
government
has
ever
read
the
statute.
and,
indeed,
the
government,
as
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
believes
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
joint
activities
that
would
be
allowed
by
the
statute.
now,
that's
not
to
say
that
congress
could
not
have
gone
farther.
in
this
specific
context,
where
one
is
regulating
dealings
with
a
foreign
organization,
it's
possible
that
congress
could
have
gone
further.
but
we
understand
the
statute
and
--
and
i
think
there's
a
--
i
think,
quite
reasonably,
as
providing
only
material
support,
a
true
service,
something
that
will
help
the
foreign
organization
in
whatever
it
does.
ms.
elena
kagan
this
would
be--
ms.
elena
kagan
--and
i
think
you
are
exactly
right
about
that.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
breyer,
i
believe
that
the
legislative
record
is
quite
clear
that
congress
thought
that
various
kinds
of
aid
given
to
the
legal
and
legitimate
activities
of
the
terrorist
organization,
in
fact,
further
the
aims
of
the
--
in
fact,
further
the
illegal
and
illegitimate
goals.
congress
made
findings
about
the
fungibility
of
these
resources.
congress
said
over
and
over
that
these
organizations
have
no
firewalls,
no
organizational
firewalls--
ms.
elena
kagan
--no
financial
firewalls.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
ginsburg,
i
agree
with
you
that
there
may
be
some
hard
cases
that
are
at
the
borderline
between
the
two,
as
there
are
in
most
statutes;
that
there
may
be
hard
cases.
this
is
not
one
of
them.
and
i
think
it
would
--
it's
very
instructive
for
the
court
--
i'm
sure
you've
all
done
this
--
but
to
actually
go
back
and
look
at
the
petitioners'
complaints
in
this
case
and
look
at
judge
fertig's
declarations
in
this
case,
because
what
they
show
is
the
extensiveness
of
the
activities
that
they
--
of
the
services
that
they
wish
to
offer
to
these
foreign
terrorist
organizations
and
the
value
that
those
services
are
going
to
give
those
foreign
terrorist
organizations.
ms.
elena
kagan
no,
i
believe
we
--
we
have,
mr.
chief
justice,
although
if
we
didn't
emphasize
it
enough,
i
--
i
will
plead
error,
because
i
think
that
it
is
an
--
a
crucial
point
to
this
case.
but
i
think
in
the
part
of
our
brief--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes.
in
the
part
of
our
brief
where
we
discuss
the
application
of
the
o'brien
standard,
and
we
say
what
are
the
governmental
interests
there.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think
that
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
have
not
specifically
addressed
the
strict
scrutiny
argument.
i
think
this
would
pass
a
strict
scrutiny
standard,
but
i
actually
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
thought
a
strict
scrutiny
standard
were
appropriate,
a
remand
might
be
in
order,
that
no
court
has
ever
actually
gone
off
on
that
ground,
that--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
alito,
i
think
that
the
--
the
training
and
advice
clauses
are,
of
course,
part
of
a
statute
which
regulates
material
support
and
resources
of
all
kinds,
and
to
the
extent
that
what
you're
saying
is,
you
know,
training
and
advice,
those
are
always
speech
restrictions
if
you
find
them
in
a
statute,
i
think
that
that's
not
right.
i
mean,
if
you
think
about
the
range
of
things
that
training
can
involve:
training
how
to
build
a
bomb,
training
how
to
fly
a
plane,
training
how
to
use
sophisticated
communications
equipment,
and
training
how
to
engage--
ms.
elena
kagan
--congress,
of
course,
allowed
them
to
engage
in
all
the
advocacy
that
they
wish
on
behalf
of
these
groups.
indeed,
congress
did
not
prohibit--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
think
if
they
are
engaged
in
just
discussion
of
ideas,
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
that.
what
the
statute
prohibits
is
the
provision
of
actual
support,
services
to
the
organizations
that
the
organization
can
use
in
its
activities,
both
legal
and
illegal.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
kennedy--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes,
i
think
that
would
be
a
service.
in
other
words,
not
an
amicus
brief
just
to
make
sure
that
we
understand
each
other.
the
petitioners
can
file
amicus
briefs
in
a
case
that
might
involve
the
pkk
or
the
ltte
for
themselves,
but
to
the
extent
that
a
lawyer
drafts
an
amicus
brief
for
the
pkk
or
for
the
ltte,
that
that's
the
amicus
party,
then
that
indeed
would
be
prohibited.
that's
the
kind
of
service
that--
ms.
elena
kagan
--no,
no,
no,
because
petitioners
here
are
arguing
for
themselves.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
petitioners
can
do
all
the
advocacy
they
want,
can
engage
in
courts
in
any
way
they
wish.
the
only
thing
that's
prohibited
is
if
the
pkk
hired
a
lawyer
to
write
an
amicus
brief
on
its
behalf.
at
that
point--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
if
the
pkk--
ms.
elena
kagan
--if
--
if
the
pkk
or
the
ltte
or
al-qaeda
or
any
of
the
other
organizations
on
this
list
said
we
want
amicus
briefs,
and
somebody
provided
an
amicus
brief--
ms.
elena
kagan
--for
themselves
--
for
themselves,
there
would
be
no
problem.
the
only
problem
is
if
somebody
drafted
an
amicus
brief--
ms.
elena
kagan
--for
the
pkk
itself.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
here
we
have
the
congressional
definition
of
what
kind
of
training
is
bad,
and
that
definition
focuses
on
training
in
specialized
activities.
now,
you
say,
well,
maybe
training
a
--
playing
a
harmonica
is
a
specialized
activity.
i
think
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
there
are
not
a
whole
lot
of
people
going
around
trying
to
teach
al-qaeda
how
to
play
harmonicas.
ms.
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
i--
[laughter]
but
i
don't
mean
to
make
fun
of
the
hypothetical
at
all,
justice
sotomayor,
because
i
think
you're
raising
an
important
point,
but
it's
really
a
point
that
goes
to
how
to
sensibly
read
a
statute.
what
congress
did,
when
in
response
to
some
lower
court
decisions,
it
further
clarified
and
defined
the
word
"training"
and
the
word
"expert
advice
and
assistance",
i
have
to
say
i
think
that
congress's
own
responses
here
--
i
mean,
they
--
congress
was
both
responsive
and
responsible,
that
it
really
took
into
account
court
decisions
and
tried
to
go
back
to
the
statute
and--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
breyer,
i
want
to
sort
of
repeat
the
--
what
i
--
what
i
said
about
the
need
to
find
a
substantial
amount
of
uncertain
or
unconstitutional
applications,
or
with
respect
to
any
kind
of
facial
challenge
or
with
respect
to
this
challenge--
ms.
elena
kagan
--to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
constitutional
claim
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
representation,
whether
it's
a
sixth
amendment
claim
or
a
due
process
claim
that
might
exist
in
criminal
cases,
that
might
exist
in
habeas
cases,
that
might
exist
in
civil
cases,
then
the
government
believes
that
the
statute
should
be
read
so
as
not
to
include
that.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
i
--
i
do
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
justice
scalia.
ms.
elena
kagan
no,
i
think
my
line
is
you
can
communicate,
but
you
can't
provide
material
support.
you
can't
make
a
donation,
whether
it's
tangible
or
intangible.
ms.
elena
kagan
no--
ms.
elena
kagan
--you
can
communicate
with
--
on
your
own,
for
sure.
independent
advocacy
of
all
kinds
is
not
touched
by
this
statute.
in
addition
to
that--
ms.
elena
kagan
--can
you
say
to
an
organization:
look,
you
guys
really
should
lay
down
your
arms.
and
two
things--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
now
you
can't,
because
when
you
tell
people
here's
how
to
apply
for
aid
and
here's
how
to
represent
yourself
within
international
organizations
or
within
the
u.s.
congress,
you've
given
them
an
extremely
valuable
skill
that
they
can
use
for
all
kinds
of
purposes,
legal
or
illegal.
and
it's
not
sufficient
for
the
petitioners--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
discussion
must
stop
when
you
--
when
you
go
over
the
line
into
giving
valuable
advice,
training,
support
to
these
organizations.
at
that
point--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
the
--
both
the
lower
courts
--
i
think
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
had
a
kind
of
confused
analysis
here,
which
is
that
they
said,
well,
it's
vague
as
applied.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
it's
not
vague
on
its
face,
and
there
is
no
facial
vagueness
claim
here,
and
yet
they
appeared
to
incorporate
aspects
of
overbreadth
analysis
into
their
as-applied
claim.
i
think--
ms.
elena
kagan
--no,
that's--
ms.
elena
kagan
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia,
and
--
and
--
and
with
respect
to
the
as-applied
vagueness
claim,
the
government's
position
is
there's
--
there's
--
there
--
it's
not
vague,
because
you
can
go
through
these
declarations,
you
can
go
through
these
complaints,
and
you
can
know
exactly
what's
included
within--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
statute
and
what's
not.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
it--
ms.
elena
kagan
--no,
i
--
i
--
i
don't
think
you
are
wrong,
justice
kennedy,
and
especially
with
respect
to
a
case
where
all
the
activity
is
--
clearly
fits
in
one
box
or
the
other.
in
other
words,
you
can
go
through
the
complaints,
you
can
go
through
the
declarations,
and
know
exactly
what
is
covered
and
what's
not
covered.
all
the
independent--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
as
i
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
will
be
some
hard
cases,
there
always
are
when
it
comes
to
applying
statutes.
the
question
is
never
are
there
hard
cases.
ms.
elena
kagan
the
question
is
the
indeterminacy.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think
it
--
it
actually
is
pretty
clear
in
this
case.
if
you
read
the
declarations,
if
you
read
the
complaints,
the
expertise
of
these
parties
actually
shines
through.
judge
fertig
is
proud
of
his
expertise,
justifiably
so.
he
has--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
this
is
not
the
typical
case.
this
is,
of
course,
a
case
that
might
never
have
reached
this
court,
except
that
it
was
brought
as
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
for
the
most
part,
what
the
government
prosecutes
are
cases
which
involve
a
wide
variety
of
support
to
foreign
terrorist
organizations.
ms.
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry?
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
stevens,
i
do
believe
that
this
individual
can
make
whatever
speeches
he
wants
at
the
united
nations.
to
the
extent
that
he
is
acting
as
a
representative
or
as
an
agent
of
the
pkk,
he
does
fall
within
the
contours
of
the
statute.
that's
a
different
thing.
ms.
elena
kagan
of
course,
that's
a
different
thing
as
to
how
prosecutorial
judgment
is
used
to
decide
which
are
the
high-priority
cases
and
which
are
the
low-priority
cases.
ms.
elena
kagan
again,
the
government
did
not
bring
this
action.
judge
fertig
and
the
petitioners
brought
this
action
to
try
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment.
as
applied
to
them,
the
statute
indeed
covers
their
various
efforts
or
proposed
activities
of
being
an
agent
of,
of
representing
the
pkk
and
the
ltte,
that
falls
within
the
statute
and
i
think
makes
the
as-applied
claim
here
not
vague
at
all.
