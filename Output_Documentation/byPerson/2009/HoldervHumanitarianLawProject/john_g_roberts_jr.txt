chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1498,
holder
v.
humanitarian
law
project
and
the
cross-petition.
mr.
cole.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
it
goes--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if
it
goes
to
the
mere
existence
of
a
group?
let's
say
you
have
the
nazi
party,
and
you
are
talking
about
advice
or
speech
on
some
purely
mundane
issue.
the
nazis
have
a
hospital,
and
you
are
giving
them
advice
on
how
to
run
a
hospital,
but
the
government
decides
that
anything
that
legitimizes
the
nazi
party,
you
know,
promotes
that
group's
terrorist
activities.
can
the
government
make
that
kind
of
determination?
i'm
thinking
of
something
like
regan
v.
wald--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--where
they
say,
look,
you
can't
travel
to
cuba
because
we
don't
want
to
do
anything
that
legitimizes
the
regime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
meant
during
world
war
ii.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
an
example
that
doesn't
implicate
the
particulars
of
the
issue
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
--
my
hypothetical
was
confusing.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
we
were
at
war.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
meant
to
hypothesize
a
group
that
the
government
could
reasonably
determine
should
not
be
supported
in
any
way--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
it
legitimizes
it.
it's
going
to
make
their
hospital
run
better.
people
are
going
to
like
their
hospital.
so
the
party,
the
group,
will
be
legitimized.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you've
picked
--
you've
picked
hypotheticals
that
are
very
easy
for
you.
what
about
personnel?
is
there
a
connection
between
providing
personnel
that
participate
in
legal
activity
on
behalf
of
a
terrorist
organization,
and
the
organization
can
then
say,
well,
because
you
are
providing
this
personnel,
we
can
take
them
out
and
shift
them
to
bombmaking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
one
of
the
things
that's
being
prohibited
here
that
you
challenge
is
providing
personnel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
your
argument
limited
to
personnel
that
engages
in
speech,
or
does
it
cover
personnel
that
--
a
nurse
at
one
of
the
--
if
there
are
any,
hamas
hospitals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cole.
general
kagan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general,
you've
talked
about
--
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
legitimate
activities
allowing
--
facilitating
illegitimate
activities
by
freeing
up
personnel
and
all
that,
and
legitimizing
the
group.
is
that
an
argument
you've
made
before
this
court
or
below?
i
looked
at
your
briefs,
and
i
thought
it's
almost
all
about:
this
is
o'brien,
this
is
conduct,
this
is
not
speech.
i
didn't
see
the
argument
that
we've
spent
a
lot
of
time
talking
about,
which
is
the
legitimate
activities
allow
the
illegitimate
activities
to
take
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
--
i
don't
mean
to
--
do
you
have
particular
references
to
where
in
your
brief
you
made
the
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
it
seems
to
me
your
case
is
all
about
o'brien.
i'm
not
sure
you
have
an
answer
to
whether
or
not
strict
scrutiny
is
satisfied.
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
some
of
this
activity
is
speech,
i
don't
see
the
argument
that
you've
presented
on
strict
scrutiny.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
you
can
communicate
on
--
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt.
but
you
can
communicate
on
your
own,
but
you
can't
communicate
with
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
i
mean,
expert
advice
or
assistance
--
i
don't
know
sitting
down
that
i
could
tell,
you
know,
how
to
advocate
for
peaceful,
you
know,
resolution
or
whatever.
is
that
expert
advice?
is
that
specialized
knowledge?
and
i
understand
training,
service,
personnel,
but
that
one's
a
little
hard
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
my
--
my
point
is
that
this--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
my
point
is
that
even
knowing
what
they
intend
to
do,
it's
kind
of
hard
to
decide
whether
that's
based
on
specialized
knowledge
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
cole,
we'll
give
you
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
don't
--
why
don't
we
remand
it
to
the
lower
courts
to
apply
strict
scrutiny
if
we
agree
with
you
that
o'brien
doesn't
apply
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
08-1498,
eric
holder,
attorney
general
versus
the
humanitarian
law
project
and
the
cross
petition.
this
litigation
involves
a
challenge
to
a
federal
law,
making
it
a
crime
to
provide
“material
support
or
resources
to
a
foreign
terrorist
organization.”
it
is
up
to
the
secretary
of
state
to
designate
a
group
as
a
foreign
terrorist
organization
under
the
law.
that
designation
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
if
the
designation
is
upheld
or
not
challenged,
it
becomes
unlawful
to
provide
the
group
with
material
support.
the
statute
defines
material
support
to
include
things
like
money
and
weapons,
but
also
the
types
of
support
that
are
at
issue
here,
training,
expert
advice
or
assistance,
services
and
personnel.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
challenge
the
statute,
seeking
an
injunction
to
prevent
the
government
from
prosecuting
them.
they
claim
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
not
in
general,
but
as
applied
to
particular
activities
that
they
want
to
pursue.
the
plaintiffs
want
to
provide
support
to
two
designated
foreign
terrorist
organizations,
the
pkk
which
is
a
group
dedicated
to
establishing
an
independent
kurdish
state
in
turkey
and
the
ltte
which
is
dedicated
to
establishing
an
independent
tamil
state
in
sri
lanka.
both
groups
engage
in
political
and
humanitarian
activities,
but
they
also
engage
extensively
in
terrorism,
including
terrorist
attacks
that
have
harmed
american
citizens.
the
plaintiffs,
however,
explain
that
they
wish
to
support
only
the
peaceful,
lawful
activities
of
the
pkk
and
the
ltte.
in
particular
they
want
to
train
the
pkk
to
use
international
law
to
resolve
disputes
peacefully,
teach
the
pkk
to
petition
the
united
states
and
other
representative
bodies
for
relief
and
engage
in
political
advocacy
on
behalf
of
kurds
living
in
turkey
and
tamils
living
in
sri
lanka.
now
this
litigation
has
a
very
complicated
12-year
history.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
district
court
partially
enjoying
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
against
the
plaintiffs
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
decision.
plaintiffs
argue
that
the
material
support
statute
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
is
too
vague
and
that
the
statute
violates
their
rights
of
free
speech
and
association
under
the
first
amendment.
all
members
of
the
court
agree
that
the
material
support
statute
is
not
vague
as
applied
to
these
plaintiffs.
the
court
of
appeals
below
reached
the
opposite
conclusion,
but
it
did
so
by
improperly
merging
plaintiff's
vagueness
claims
with
their
first
amendment
claims.
it
essentially
concluded
that
the
statute
was
vague
because
it
applied
to
speech,
but
if
a
clear
statute
applies
to
speech
it
is
still
clear.
the
statute
might
violate
the
first
amendment
but
that
is
separate
from
a
claim
that
it
is
vague.
under
a
proper
analysis
plaintiffs
cannot
succeed
on
their
vagueness
claims
because
their
application
of
the
statute
to
their
proposed
activities
is
straightforward.
turning
to
the
first
amendment
issue
both
sides
in
the
case,
the
government
and
the
plaintiffs,
present
extreme
positions,
and
we
reject
them
both.
we
reject
the
plaintiff's
view
that
the
statute
bans
pure
political
speech,
it
does
not.
under
this
law
the
plaintiffs
may
say
anything
they
wish
on
any
topic.
they
may
speak
and
write
freely
about
the
pkk
and
the
ltte,
the
governments
of
turkey
and
sri
lanka,
human
rights
and
international
law.
they
may
advocate
before
the
united
nations.
what
they
may
not
do
is
engage
in
a
narrow
range
of
speech
that
qualifies
as
material
support
under
the
statute,
training,
advice
or
services
to
or
in
connection
with
foreign
terrorist
groups.
now
at
the
same
time
we
also
reject
the
government's
view
that
this
case
is
only
about
conduct
not
speech.
these
plaintiffs
want
to
speak
to
the
pkk
and
teach
them
things
like
international
dispute
resolution.
that
means
that
the
government
has
to
satisfy
a
more
demanding
standard
than
if
the
case
were
just
about
conduct.
now
no
one
doubts
that
the
government
has
a
strong
interest
in
preventing
terrorism,
but
the
players
argue
that
prohibiting
their
speech
will
not
further
that
interest
because
they
seek
to
promote
only
the
lawful,
nonviolent
activities
of
the
pkk
and
ltte,
not
their
terrorism.
both
congress
and
the
executive
branch,
however,
have
considered
the
question
and
determine
that
it
is
not
possible
to
draw
a
meaningful
distinction
between
support
for
a
terrorist
groups
lawful
activities
and
support
for
terrorism.
when
congress
enacted
this
law,
it
specifically
found
that
foreign
terrorist
organizations
“are
so
tainted
by
their
criminal
conduct
that
any
contribution
to
such
an
organization
facilitates
that
conduct.”
the
executive
branch
shares
this
view.
the
state
department,
for
example,
has
concluded
that
“given
the
purposes
organizational
structure
and
planned
--
and
nature
of
foreign
terrorist
organizations
it
is
highly
likely
that
any
material
support
to
these
organizations
will
ultimately
inure
to
the
benefit
of
their
criminal
terrorist
functions,
regardless
of
weather
such
supports
was
ostensibly
intended
to
support
non-violent,
non-terrorist
activities.
we
have
no
basis
for
disagreeing
with
our
conclusion.
terrorist
groups
do
not
meaningfully
segregate
their
non-violent
activities
from
the
violent
ones.
in
fact
they
often
use
their
peaceful
components
to
raise
funds
that
can
be
put
to
deadly
purposes.
material
support
for
terrorist
organizations
also
undermines
a
nation's
relationship
with
its
allies,
including
allies
they
are
defending
themselves
against
these
terrorist
groups.
in
this
particular
case,
training
the
pkk
on
how
to
use
international
law
to
resolve
disputes
may
sound
benign,
but
training
and
advising
a
terrorist
group
augments
the
tools
available
to
that
terrorist
group
and
those
tools
will
not
always
be
used
to
achieve
good
ends.
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
how
better
international
negotiation
and
dispute
resolution
skills
may
be
used
this
part
of
a
broader
terrorist
strategy.
the
pkk
appears
to
have
just
done
in
the
past.
negotiating
agreements
to
buy
time
and
recover
from
set
backs
all
the
while
preparing
to
renew
terrorist
attacks.
in
addition,
teaching
the
terrorist
groups,
how
to
petition
united
nations
for
relief
could
obviously
generate
funds
that
could
be
redirected
to
support
terrorist
activities.
now,
there
is
thoughtful
dissent
in
this
case
for
three
members
of
the
court
and
it
has
ensured
that
the
majority
has
considered
all
the
arguments
on
the
other
side.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
however,
the
court
cannot
agree
with
the
dissent
that
advise
and
training
plaintiffs
that
they
hope
to
share
with
these
designated
foreign
terrorist
organizations
is
necessarily
all
to
the
good.
congress
and
the
executive
disagree
with
that
view
and
so
do
we.
the
dissent
would
insist
that
the
government
provide
more
specific
evidence
showing
that
the
activities
of
these
plaintiffs
will
lead
to
terrorist
attacks.
we
think
that
would
be
a
dangerous
requirement.
this
law
does
not
punish
terrorist
acts,
but
instead
seeks
to
prevent
them
by
denying
terrorists
material
support.
in
that
context,
the
government
must
often
rely
to
a
greater
extent
on
informed
judgment
rather
than
hard
evidence
of
a
particular
connection
between
the
proposed
support
and
the
group's
terrorist
agenda.
the
hard
evidence
may
not
be
available
until
it's
too
late
to
prevent
the
diversion
of
training
and
advice
for
lawful
activities
to
be
used
to
promote
terrorism.
in
reaching
our
conclusions,
we
find
it's
significant
that
congress
has
proceeded
carefully
in
this
area
with
appropriate
regard
for
first
amendment
interest.
it
applied
the
law
only
to
designated
foreign
terrorist
organizations.
there
has
always
been
a
limited
numbers
of
such
groups
and
any
group
so
designated
can
have
a
court
review
the
designation.
second:
congress
added
clarity
to
the
statue
by
providing
harrowing
definitions
of
its
terms
on
several
occasions.
third:
congress
has
created
limited
exceptions
to
the
ban
on
material
support,
including
for
medicine
and
religious
materials.
finally
and
most
importantly,
congress
has
avoided
any
restriction
on
independent
advocacy
or
indeed
any
activities
not
directed
to
coordinated
with
or
controlled
by
foreign
terrorist
groups.
now
at
bottom,
the
plaintiffs
simply
disagree
with
the
considered
judgment
of
congress
and
the
executives
that
providing
material
support
to
designated
foreign
terrorist
organizations
even
seemingly
benign
support
advances
the
terrorist
actives
of
that
organization,
we
have
no
basis
for
over
turning
there
judgment.
finally
it
is
important
to
recognize
what
we
do
not
decide.
we
do
not
decide
whether
future
applications
of
the
material
support
statue
to
speech
or
advocacy
other
than
that
described
by
these
plaintiffs
will
survive
first
amendment
scrutiny.
we
in
no
way
suggest
that
regulation
of
the
independent
speech
would
pass
constitutional
muster
even
if
the
government
were
to
show
that
such
speech
benefits
foreign
terrorist
organization.
this
case
is
not
about
independent
political
speech.
congress
drew
a
line
between
independent
and
coordinated
activities
in
the
material
support
statue
and
that
is
an
important
distinction.
we
also
do
not
suggest
that
congress
could
extend
the
same
prohibition
on
material
support
at
issue
here
to
domestic
organizations.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
joined
by
justices
ginsburg
and
sotomayor.
