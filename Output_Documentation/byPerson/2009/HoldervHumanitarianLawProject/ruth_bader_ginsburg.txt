but
if
you
can't
travel
there
--
suppose
you
want
to
travel
there
so
that
you
can
meet
with
and
discuss
lawful
activities
with
people
there.
if
you
can't
get
there,
you
can't
speak.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
cole,
as
i
remember,
scales
upheld
a
conviction,
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
cole,
would
you
distinguish
--
i
think
this
came
up
in
the
court
of
appeals.
there
are
a
lot
of
groups
on
the
list.
i
think
the
al-qaeda
was
one
instance
that
was
mentioned,
and,
at
least
according
to
the
briefs,
you
conceded
that
if
you
wanted
to
do
just
what
you
describe
with
respect
to
the
kurdish
group
or
the
tamil
group,
the
ban
would
be
permissible,
if
the
group
--
if
the
group
were
al-qaeda,
and
i'll
throw
in
the
taliban.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
--
then
as
--
suppose
the
group
is
not
the
two
that
we
have
here--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
al-qaeda
and
the
taliban?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
want
to
give
an
answer
to
the
taliban
and
the
al-qaeda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--whatever
way
they
wish.
they're
making
clear
that
it's
only
in
connection
with
lawful
activity
of
the
group,
and
indeed
it's
to
train
them
in
using
lawful
means
to
achieve
their
end.
and
i
thought
you
went
further
than
saying
there
has
to
be
strictly
independent
advocacy.
you
recognized
in
your
brief
that
they
could
meet
with
members
of
these
terrorist
organizations.
they
could
meet
and
communicate
with
them,
but
they
can't
communicate
advice
on
how
to
pursue
their
goals
through
lawful
means?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
but
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
say
that
the
--
not
only
the
membership,
but
they
can
meet
and
they
can
discuss.
and
i
don't
understand
the
line
between
meeting
with
these
terrorist
organizations,
discussing
things
with
them,
and
instructing
them
on
how
they
can
pursue
their
goals
through
lawful
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
involved
here
--
i
think
they
said
that
they
want
to
train
them
how
to
do
lawful
things,
how
to
pursue
their
goals
in
a
lawful,
rather
than
a
terrorist,
way.
and
that
is
speech.
it
is
not
conduct.
they
want
to
engage
in
advocacy
of
peaceful
means
of
achieving
the
goals
of
these
groups.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
want
to
communicate,
and
you
say
they
can
communicate.
and
i
still
am
having
trouble
with
the
line
of
what
they
can
communicate
and
what
they
can't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
answer
on
the
other
side
is:
all
we
want
to
do
is
speak
about
lawful
activities.
we're
not
supplying
any
guns,
any
communication
equipment.
we
just
want
to
speak
about
lawful
activities.
and
i
go
back
to
my
failure
to
understand
your
line
between,
yes,
you
can
communicate
with
these
people,
but
you
can't
communicate
about
going
about
their
aims
through
peaceful
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
can
--
you
can
communicate,
but
the
communications
are
censored.
that's
--
you
said
you
can
meet
with
--
you
can
be
a
member,
you
can
attend
meetings,
you
can
discuss
things,
but
there
are
only
--
there's
a
certain
point
at
which
the
discussion
must
stop,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
this
--
what
--
what
these
plaintiffs
are
seeking
to
do
--
does
it
have
any
resemblance
to
the
150
prosecutions
that
you
have
brought
under
this
act?
it
was
my
understanding
that
those
were
for
supplying
weapons,
supplying
other
equipment.
are
there
any
prosecutions
that
are
--
that
aim
at
training
to
pursue
the
organization's
aims
through
peaceful
means?
