justice
stephen
g.
breyer
supposing
that
--
what
you
say
is
you
want
to
engage
in
political
advocacy
on
behalf
of
the
kurds.
that's
your
words.
all
right.
suppose
--
and
these
are
two
hypotheticals.
hypothetical
one,
your
clients,
let's
say,
or
some
other
people,
know
that
what
the
kurds'
hypothetical
plan
is,
is
to
pretend
they're
a
political
advocacy
organization,
but
to
go
around
shooting
the
people
who
don't
agree
with
them.
okay?
case
one,
the
hypothetical
defendant
knows
it.
in
case
two,
he
doesn't
know
it,
but
it's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wait.
they
want
to
apply.
they
want
to
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
say
in
this
case
that
they
want
to
provide
training
in
the
issue
of
humanitarian
international
law,
and
they
want
to
provide
training
and
expert
advice
and
assistance
in
respect
to
how
you
petition
the
un.
now
focusing
on
those
two
things,
and
going
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
why
--
what
is
the
government's
interest
in
the
following?
under
o'brien
or
any
other
test,
you
look
at
it
and
say,
does
teaching
have
a
first
amendment
interest
--
training?
yes.
and
what
about
teaching
about
advocacy?
that's
what
they
are
doing,
teaching
about
a
certain
kind
of
advocacy.
therefore
there
is
a
first
amendment
interest
implicated,
seriously.
now,
when
that
is
seriously
implicated,
there
is
also
a
government
interest,
on
the
other
side,
in
not
having
terrorism.
but
there
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative
which
they
suggest,
that
in
that
situation,
what
they're
entitled
to
read
this
statute
as
saying
is
that,
if
they
believe
and
a
person
reasonably
would
believe
that
their
teaching,
assistance,
training,
would
not
significantly
aid
this
organization
in
its
unlawful
ends,
then
they
are
not
guilty.
now,
what
is
the
government's
interest
in
not
accepting
that
interpretation?
the
first
amendment
is
hurt;
there
is
an
interest;
but
there
is
what
they
describe
as
--
and
what
i
have
narrowed
--
a
less
restrictive
way
of
going
about
it.
and
they
have
to
be
reasonable
in
what
they
think.
now,
what's
the
objection
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
talking
about
tsunami
aid.
i
am
talking
about
the
instance
where
the
teaching
is
itself
teaching
about
how
to
do
something,
and
that
something
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
first
amendment
protects.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
and
if
a
reasonable
person
would
know
that,
that
it's
going
to
help
them,
then
it
is
unlawful,
if
it's
going
to
help
them
and
a
reasonable
person
would
think
it
was
going
to
help
them
in
their
unlawful
activities.
but
we're
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
but
petitioning
the
united
nations
--
and
that's
what
you
are
teaching
them
--
does
not,
on
its
face,
seem
to
me
to
be
something
that
reasonably
you
would
think
was
going
to
aid
them
in
their
unlawful
objectives,
but
for
the
realm
of
ideas.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
then
congress
put
a
thing
in
here
which
says:
don't
construe
this
statute
in
a
way
that
will
abridge
first
amendment
rights.
so
it's
aware
of
the
problem
of
first
amendment
rights.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
any
evidence
that
something
like
that
would,
in
fact,
but
for
the
realm
of
ideas,
help
this
organization
commit
its
terrorist
acts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
that
--
on
the
--
just
forget
the
harmonica
for
a
second;
i'm
more
worried
about
the
lawyer.
you're
saying
that
a
--
a
group
abroad
which
may
have
some
american
citizens
in
it
--
let's
assume
they
do
--
want
to
hire
a
lawyer.
and
this
lawyer
is
supposed
to
file
some
amicus
briefs
and
do
other
activities.
you're
saying
congress
has
forbidden
that
in
this
statute,
and
that's
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
want
to
know
if
that's
what
you're
saying,
what
i
just
said:
that
an
organization
has
american
citizens,
engages
in
terrible
stuff,
but
they
are
not
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
have
a
lawyer
in
the
united
states
who
does
legal
work
like
filing
amicus
briefs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
ginsburg,
justice
sotomayor
and
i
dissent.
we
agree
with
the
court
that
the
statute
is
not
vague,
but
we
do
not
agree
that
the
constitution
permits
criminal
prosecution
for
what
the
plaintiffs
want
to
do
here
as
you
heard,
train
the
members
of
the
pkk
how
to
use
humanitarian
and
international
law
to
peacefully
resolve
disputes,
teach
them
how
to
petition
various
representative
bodies
such
as
the
united
nations
and
engage
in
political
advocacy
on
their
behalf
for
peaceful
purpose.
now,
the
issue
before
us
as
you
also
heard
raises
a
more
general
problem.
how
does
the
first
amendment
apply
where
national
security
interests
are
at
stake?
in
cases
like
that
our
decisions
have
to
reflect
the
constitution's
grant
of
foreign
affairs
and
defense
powers
to
the
president
and
to
congress,
that's
appropriate,
but
without
denying
our
own
special
judicial
obligation
to
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals.
that
means
that
national
security
does
not
always
win.
rather
when
applying
the
constitution
at
the
least
we
have
to
examine
the
competing
harms
and
justifications
and
with
an
understanding
that
departures
from
ordinary
protective
norms
must
come
accompanied
with
strong
justifications.
the
majority
seems
to
accept
this
general
approach,
but
in
our
view
it
does
not
properly
apply
that
approach
in
this
case.
now
remember
the
activity
at
issue.
it
consists
of
teaching
pkk
members
how
to
use
international
human
rights
law
to
peacefully
resolve
disputes
and
how
to
petition,
for
example
the
united
nations,
for
help.
this
activity
involves,
one,
speech
and
teaching,
two,
the
subject
matter
that
is
how
to
petition
and
use
law,
three,
for
peaceful
purposes.
it
is
the
kind
of
activity
to
which
the
first
amendment
ordinarily
offers
it's
strongest
protection.
well,
what
then
can
justify
the
suppression
of
that
activity
here?
now,
let's
see
what
is
said.
first,
the
government
and
the
majority
as
you
heard
emphasizes
the
fact
that
only
coordinated
activity,
not
independent
activity
violates
the
statute.
the
point
presumably
is
that
the
statute
is
not
as
restrictive
of
first
amendment
rights
as
we
think
because
the
plaintiffs
remain
free
to
act
independently
without
coordination,
but
this
coordination
requirement
whatever
it
does
doesn't
help
these
plaintiffs
or
their
activities.
how
can
they
teach
a
class
about
human
rights
law?
how
can
they
teach
about
petitioning
the
un
to
achieve
a
particular
political
goal
without
coordinating
the
details
of
the
teaching
activity
with
members
of
the
group?
to
suppress
this
teaching
activity
on
the
ground
that
it
is
coordinated
is
to
suppress
the
activity
itself.
second,
the
government
and
the
majority
say
that
the
teaching
is
fungible.
to
permit
it
could
free
up
resources
more
readily
put
to
sinister
use.
now,
i
understand
that
concepts
of
fungibility
where
money
or
the
equivalent
is
at
issue.
money
given
for
charitable
purposes,
for
example,
could
free
up
all
their
money
used
to
buy
arms,
but
i
do
not
understand
how
fungibility
works
or
teaching
human's
rights
law
is
involved.
the
government
and
the
majority
rely
mostly
on
an
affidavit
and
some
statements
in
the
statute
but
if
you
look
at
what
they
say,
they
talk
not
about
first
amendment
rights,
they
talk
about
money
or
things
equivalent
to
money.
so,
how
is
the
affidavit
relevant
to
the
problem
before
us?
third,
the
government
says
the
teaching,
the
pkk
about
human
rights
law
could
lend
the
group
legitimacy.
well,
so
does
virtually
any
speech
related
activity
that
favors
such
a
group's
political
aims
including
and
i'd
say
particularly,
the
independent
advocacy
that
the
government
would
not
make
criminal.
that
certainly
helps
make
them
legitimate.
so,
to
accept
this
kind
of
argument
when
put
in
only
general
terms
as
a
justification
is
to
say
that
in
such
a
case
security
interests
always
trump
the
first
amendment.
that
never
has
been
and
it
should
not
be
the
law.
the
government
points
to
nothing
more
specific
that
could
show
some
special
problem
here
related
to
some
special
circumstance.
fourth:
the
majority
in
trying
to
fill
what
i
see
is
a
void
in
the
government's
general
claim
with
it's
own
thoughts
says
that
training
members
of
the
pkk
about
how
to
use
international
human
rights
law
to
peacefully
resolve
disputes
could
allow
the
pkk
“to
buy
time
allowing
opponents
into
complacency”
or
the
pkk
might
use
it's
new
information
about
the
structures
of
the
international
legal
system
“to
threaten,
manipulate
or
disrupt,”
but
these
arguments
simply
amount
to
a
general
claim
that
bad
faith
is
possible
and
they're
right.
bad
faith
is
always
a
possibility
where
speech
and
learning
about
law
and
negotiation
are
at
issue,
so
is
good
faith
a
possibility,
but
a
general
claim
that
there
might
be
bad
faith
by
itself
cannot
justify.
suppression
of
speech
here
without
doing
the
same
in
vast
numbers
of
other
cases
where
important
first
amendment
rights
are
at
issue.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
logic
or
constitutional
principle
or
prior
case
law
that
would
find
justification
for
suppressing
speech
related
activity
where
the
justification
consists
just
of
this
kind
of
general
assertion
which
comes
down
to
saying
a
little
knowledge
about
the
international
legal
system
is
too
dangerous
a
thing
or
teaching
about
human
rights
law
is
dangerous
because
it
might
lead
to
a
group's
insincerely
pretending
to
be
interested
in
negotiation.
the
absence
of
authority
or
logic
or
constitutional
reason
that
would
support
that
kind
of
view
to
me
is
not
surprising.
in
a
nation
such
as
ours,
a
democracy
committed
to
the
resolution
of
disputes
to
what
justice
brandeis
has
called
the
deliberative
forces.
fifth
and
finally,
the
majority
says
that
the
statute
itself,
it's
aims
and
objectives
shows
the
need
for
applying
it's
criminal
provisions
here,
but
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
i
believe
shows
the
opposite.
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
when
reporting
the
bill
from
committee
said
that
he
was
“convinced
we
have
crafted
a
narrow
but
effective
provision
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
knowingly
provide
material
support
to
the
terrorist
functions
of
foreign
groups
while
safeguarding
the
freedom
to
associate
which
none
of
us
would
willingly
give
up.”
and
the
statute's
express
written
provisions
themselves
seek
to
protect
the
rights
the
first
amendment
guarantees
for
they
expressly
forbid
construing
it's
language
“so
as
to
abridge
the
exercise
of
rights
guaranteed
under
the
first
amendment.”
the
majority's
conclusion
we
think
is
particularly
unfortunate
for
there
is
no
need
to
interpret
the
statute,
to
apply
to
the
activities
in
question
when
they
are
engaged
in
innocently.
we
could
simply
interpret
the
word
knowingly
in
the
statute
so
that
it
criminalizes
this
conduct
only
where
a
defendant
knows
that
his
or
her
activities
are
likely
to
help
the
organization
engage
in
not
peaceful
but
terrorist
work.
in
doing
so,
interpreting
in
that
way
we
think
we
would
maintain
the
statute's
ability
to
achieve
its
core
national
security
objectives
while
simultaneously
maintaining
the
constitution's
core
protection
for
free
speech
and
free
association.
we
explain
this
further
in
our
opinion.
in
essence,
we
fear
that
the
court
has
failed
to
examine
the
justification
the
government
advances
with
sufficient
care.
it
is
relied
too
heavily
on
general
assertion.
it
has
failed
to
insist
upon
the
tailoring
of
means
to
fit
compelling
ends
and
ultimately,
it
has
deprived
the
individuals
before
us
of
the
protection
that
in
our
view
the
first
amendment
warrants.
with
respect
we
dissent.
