justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
can't
there
be--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
the
government
stop
you
from
meeting
anywhere
with
the
terrorists?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
meeting,
traveling
to
one
of
these
countries
to
actually
do
your
teaching
to
a
terrorist
--
let's
say
the
law
said
you're
prohibited
from
traveling
to
meet
any
of
these
individuals.
how
would
that
be
different
than
the
cuba
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
no
different
than
the
cuba
situation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
cole--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--when
--
but
the
way
you
define
the
speech
that
you
want
protected
is
speech
that
is
advocating
some
lawful
activity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
unlawful
about
teaching
people
medicine
and
how
to
cure
people
from
infection?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
see
no
difference
--
you're
not
advocating
a
difference
in
this
case
between
training
that
could
reasonably
be
used
in
terrorist
activities,
because
teaching
people
how
to
care
for
the
ill
could
be
used
to
teach
people
how
to
care
for
the
wounded.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right?
and
the
political
speech
that
your
group
is
advocating,
i.e.,
the
petitioning
--
you're
not
willing
to
draw
a
distinction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
saying
to
us
the
case
stands
and
falls
on
whether
or
not
we
accept
that
this
statute
regulates
conduct
as
opposed
to
speech?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
it
regulates
training.
and
what
--
the
question
i
asked
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--was
whether
there
was
a
way
in
your
challenge,
or
whether
you
are
advocating
any
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
speech,
that
it's
--
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
the
question
--
because
the
only
answer
you
have
given
us
is
if
it's
lawful
speech,
it's
protected.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
give
me
an
analytical
framework
to
address
that
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
government
says
under
o'brien
even
the
speech
that
you
want
--
forget
about
the
tsunami
aid
speech.
let's
just
talk
about
the
political
petitioning
speech,
the
petitioning
for--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
there
a
difference
and
under
what
analytical
framework
would
we
reach
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
a
terrorist
was
arrested
in
the
united
states
from
one
of
these
groups,
would
they
be
barred
under
the
statute
from
serving
as
their
attorney
in
a
u.s.
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
material
support
under
the
definition
that
you
have
been
advocating?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
but
i'm
asking
you
why.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
can
i
--
can
i
ask
you
something?
i
mean,
part
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
right
for
the
--
to
petition
the
government
for
redress
of
grievances.
putting
aside
all
of
the
other
aid
they
are
claiming,
the
tsunami
aid,
the
training
and
other
things,
can
the
statute
constitutionally
be
read
to
bar
them
from
petitioning
legitimate
agencies,
legitimate
government
agencies,
to
peacefully,
using
the
words
of
the
constitution,
to
effect
legal
change?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
--
that's
part
of
what
they're
claiming
their
speech
involves--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--training
and
doing
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
doesn't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--answer
--
what
is
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble?
now,
mind
you,
i
understand
this
is
the
right
of
u.s.
citizens
in
the
united
states.
but
what
in
the
first
amendment
or
even
in
this
statute
could
justify
congress
from
barring
individuals
to
petition
peacefully
united
--
world
agencies
or
even
u.s.
agencies--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--for
the
recognition
of
a
--
of
a
legitimate
goal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
training
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--general,
i
understand,
i
could
be
wrong,
that
many
petitioners
or
respondents
go
out
to
the
industry
and
say
we
need
some
amicus
briefs,
and
they
flood
in
from
all
sides.
would
that
be
illegal?
because
the
--
the
organization--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--came
out
and
said
we
need
a
brief
--
amicus
briefs
from
law
professors?
from--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--without
pay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
can
we
can
ever
separate--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--under
the
definition
of
this
statute,
teaching
these
members
to
play
the
harmonica
would
be
unlawful.
you
are
teaching
--
training
them
in
a
lawful
--
in
a
specialized
activity.
so
how
do
we
--
there
has
to
be
something
more
than
merely
a
congressional
finding
that
any
training
is
bad.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
o'brien
applies,
what
remains
of
your
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
analysis
of
the
activities
that
you
are
proposing
has
not
been
done
by
the
lower
courts,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
--
they
haven't
--
they
struck
it
on
vagueness
grounds,
but
none--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--none
of
the
courts
either
subjected
this
to
strict
scrutiny
or
the
reasonable
fit--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
cole,
there
were
congressional
findings
that
money
is
fungible
first
for
terrorist
groups,
like
--
that
if
you
give
them
money
for
legitimate
means,
that
it's
going
to
be
siphoned
off
and
used
for
illegitimate
means.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
why
isn't
that
enough,
either
under
strict
scrutiny
or
a
lesser
standard,
reasonable
fit
standard,
to
say
that
you
can't
teach
these
groups
how
to
get
money?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
one
of
your
--
one
of
your
stated
aims,
at
least
of
one
of
the
groups
is
to
teach
them
how
to
get
aid
for
tsunami
relief.
