justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
the
government,
i
assume
--
i
assume
you
will
say
ngo
or
other
organization
or
person
from
giving
tsunami
aid
to
one
of
these
organizations,
from
giving
them
money?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
--
could
the
government
prohibit
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
let's
assume
the
government
could
prohibit
that.
then
the
next
question
is:
could
the
government
prohibit
speech
instructing
the
terrorist
organization
how
to
get
the
tsunami
aid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
brandenburg?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
if
you
get
tsunami
money,
that
frees
up
your
other
assets
for
terrorist
money.
so
why
can't
the
government
forbid
teaching
how
to
get
that
money?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
what's
the
test?
is
it
--
you
say
it's
not
brandenburg?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it's
a
ban
just
for
travel
to
meet
with
terrorist
organizations,
justice
sotomayor's
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
about
the
--
what
about
the
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
what
the
chief
justice
says:
in
any
context,
support
ultimately
will
inure
to
the
benefit
of
a
terrorist
organization,
and
we
have
a
governmental
interest
in
not
allowing
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i
thought
that
he
was
--
he
wants
to
meet
with
the
people.
the
new
york
times
didn't
meet
with
hamas
to
tell
them
how
great
their
editorial
was.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
didn't
--
it
was
not
a
statute
which
involves
banning
financial
or
other
tangible
support,
and
page
17
of
your
brief
made
--
this
is
a
difficult
case
for
me.
and
the
second
paragraph,
page
17,
you
say:
"the
narrow
focus
of
plaintiffs'
claims
in
this
court
means
that
the
case
does
not
involve
the
propriety
of
banning
financial
or
other
tangible
support.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
you
say:
"nor
does
it
involve
speech
advocating
or
teaching
criminal
or
violent
activity.
"
but
it
does
involve
speech,
let's
say
arguendo,
that
is
tantamount
to
material
support.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
speech
is
tantamount
to
material
support
in
that
it
legitimizes,
encourages,
or
strengthens
the
organization.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
is
support.
it's
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
wasn't
a
statute
on
the
books
that
prohibited
material
support--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
here
there
is,
and
this
is
in
aid
of
that
prohibition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
have
to
be
conscious
of
the
white
light.
i
have
just
one
--
one
question.
the
old
equity
rule
was
that
you
don't
enjoin
a
criminal
statute;
you
wait
until
something
happens.
and
the
reason
is
then
we
have
specific
facts.
and
if
we
said
that
here,
you
would
say,
oh,
you're
chilling
speech.
what's
your
best
case
in
the
precedents
of
this
court
for
our
entertaining
an
challenge
that
--
this
is
not
really
--
we
usually
talk
about
as-applied
after
the
fact.
coates,
there
was
a
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
--
what's
your
best
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
they
--
can
they
advocate
to
the
association?
there
are
many
kinds
of
advocacy.
you
can
advocate
to
the
world
that
they
are
right.
can
you
advocate
to
the
association
that
you
should
change
your
ways,
that
you
should
use
lexis
to
find
international
law
precedents,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
suppose
the
organization's
board
of
directors
agrees
with
that
and
wants
them
to
address
the
general
membership
on
that
point,
and
they
are
doing
it
with
the
blessing
of
the
organization.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
stick
with
the
argument
made
below
that
it's
unlawful
to
file
an
amicus
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
i'm
right
in
saying
it
that
that
was
the
argument
below.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
ginsburg's
question
is:
can
you
advocate
peaceful
means?
and
let's
assume
that
if
they
embrace
peaceful
means,
they
get
more
interest
in
their
organization,
the
organization
becomes
stronger
for
all
purposes.
can
you
do
that?
that
was
justice
ginsburg's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
here's
how
to
do
it.
and
here's
how
to
go
to
the
u.n.,
and
here's
how
to
apply
for
aid,
and
here's
how
to
file
an
amicus
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
i
have
the
same--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
had
the
same
question
as
justice
stevens.
it's
a
very
odd
as-applied
challenge
because
there
hasn't
been
a
prosecution.
and
vagueness
as
applied,
i
think
as
professor
cole
can
answer,
is,
it
seems
to
me,
if,
you
know,
that
it
applies,
it
isn't
vague.
i
don't
understand
that,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
think
of
a
case
in
which
the
court,
pre-prosecution
in
a
declaratory
judgment,
has
said
that
it's
improper
as
applied
to
certain
things.
or
maybe
i'm
wrong.
maybe
i
am
missing
some
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
agree.
and
that
was
as
applied
to
a
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
haven't
seen
an
as-applied
challenge
on
declaratory
relief.
the
government
doesn't
seem
to
object
to
that
procedure.
