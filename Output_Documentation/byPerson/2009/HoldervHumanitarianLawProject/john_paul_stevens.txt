justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
cole,
don't
you
agree
that
some
of
the
speech
could
be
regulated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
of
the
speech
of
your
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
all
of
the
speech
at
issue
is
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
identified
quite
a
bit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
those
cases,
the
real
question
was
whether
membership
was
enough,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
that
point.
you
think
the
issue
in
this
case
would
be
different
if
we
were
at
war?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
true,
why
aren't
we
now
at
war,
with
regard
to
our
opposition
to
these
organizations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
difference,
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
question
that
i
want
to
be
sure
you
are
focusing
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
in
the
issues
in
this
very
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
they
be
different
if
we
were
now
at
war?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
seems
to
me
that
your
opponent's
argument
here
today
is
prohibited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
sort
of
basic
question
that
i've
had
trouble
with
throughout
the
whole
argument?
we're
talking
about
whether
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge
or
on
its
face.
and
what
the
district
judge
did
was
hold
part
of
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
being
too
vague:
the
words
"training"
and
"advice",
et
cetera.
why
isn't
that
a
facial
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
specifically,
does
this
particular
man
have
to
be
prosecuted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
particular
individual
in
risk
of
being
prosecuted
if
he
makes
the
speech
to
the
united
nations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
there
evidence
that
he
would
be
prosecuted
if
he--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
in
essence,
this
is
an
action
to
enjoin
a
potential
prosecution
against
somebody
for
making
a
potential
speech?
that's
really
what
we
are
fighting
about,
i
think.
