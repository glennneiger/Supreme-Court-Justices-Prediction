and
that
applies--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
that
goes
for
all
forms
of
training?
no
form
of
training
or
expert
assistance
can
be
prohibited
unless
the
individual
specifically
intends
to
further
--
that
the
training
will
be
used
to
carry
out
terrorist
activities?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
just
out
of
curiosity,
i
thought
your
position
was
that
no
form
of
training
or
assistance
could
be
prohibited--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
that's
not
your
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
doesn't
that
lead
to
--
kind
of
logically
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
mere
membership
could
be
prohibited?
could
you
explain
how
someone
could
be
a
member
of
one
of
these
organizations
without
providing
a
service
to
the
organization?
simply
by
lending
one's
name
as
a
member
--
that
might
be
regarded
as
a
service.
if
you
attended
a
meeting
and
you
helped
to
arrange
the
chairs
in
advance
or
clean
up
afterwards,
you'd
be
providing
a
service
to
the
organization.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
o'brien
the
correct
standard?
how
can
you
argue
that
training
and
providing
advice
is
not
speech?
