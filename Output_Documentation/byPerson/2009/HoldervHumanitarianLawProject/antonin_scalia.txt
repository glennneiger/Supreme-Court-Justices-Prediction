justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
hasn't
criminalized
speech.
it
has
criminalized
providing
aid
and
assistance
to
these
organizations.
most
of
that
aid
and
assistance
that
is
prohibited
is
not
in
the
form
of
speech,
but
it
happens
to
include
speech
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
quite
different
from
a
law
that
is
directed
explicitly
at
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
right
--
that's
not
the
right
number
three.
the
right
number
three
is
you
cannot
advise
and
assist
an
organization
that
is
seeking
to
overthrow
the
government.
that's
what
is
at
issue
here,
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
independently
promoting
the
objectives
of
these
terrorist
organizations.
your
--
your
clients
are
free
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when
they
assist
the
organization
by
providing
advice,
that's
a
different
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
when
they
provide
a
benefit,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
--
we
can
cross
that
bridge
when
we
come
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge,
and
we
are
talking
about
the
kind
of
advice
and
assistance
that
your
clients
want
to
give.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
new
york
times
editorial.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
"coordinating"
means,
doesn't
it?
and
we
can
determine
that
in
the
next
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
end
that
congress
seeks
to
proscribe
is
the
existence
of
these
terrorist
organizations.
and
the
theory
of
the
legislation
is
that
when
you
aid
any
of
their
enterprises
you're
aiding
the
organization.
hamas,
for
example,
gained
support
among
--
among
the
palestinians
by
activities
that
are
perfectly
lawful,
perhaps
running
hospitals,
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
what
fosters
the
terrorist
organization
and
enables
the
terrorist
activities.
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
connection?
any
assistance
you
provide
to
these
organizations
cannot
be
separated
from
assistance
to
their
terrorist
activities.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
very
unrealistic
to
compare
these
terrorist
organizations
with
the
communist
party.
those
cases
involved
philosophy.
the
communist
party
was
--
was
--
was
more
than
a
--
than
an
organization
that
--
that
had
some
unlawful
ends.
it
was
also
a
philosophy
of
--
of
--
of
extreme
socialism.
and
--
and
many
people
subscribed
to
that
philosophy.
i
don't
think
that
hamas
or
any
of
these
terrorist
organizations
represent
such
a
philosophical
organization.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be,
but
people
joined
it
for
philosophical
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
joined
it
for
philosophical
reasons.
these
terrorist
organizations
have
very
practical
objectives.
and
the
only
reason
for
joining
them
or
assisting
them
is
to
assist
those
practical
objectives.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
a
way
there
is.
what
about
--
what
about
aiding
organizations
that
are
acting
criminally,
killing
innocent
civilians,
with
regard
to
one
of
our
allies?
and
we're
seeking
to
gain
the
assistance
of
these
allies
against
those
terrorists
who
aim
their
terrorism
at
us,
and
yet--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
--
we
are
supposed
to
allow
our
citizens
to
assist
the
terrorist
organizations
that
are
directing
their
violence
against
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
a
sufficiently
serious
reason
for
the
government
to
do
what
it's
done
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
congress
clearly
did
not
intend
that?
you
know,
i
would
have
guessed
that
you
are
providing
a
service
or
personnel
when
you
make
yourself
a
member
of
the
organization.
why
do
you
say
congress
clearly
did
not
intend
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mohammed
atta
and
his
harmonica
quartet
might
tour
the
country
and
make
a
lot
of
money.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
these
hypotheticals
make
any
difference?
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge.
we
should
look
to
the
activities
that
this
organization
wants
to
conduct,
unless
--
unless
you
think
that
there
is
an
overbreadth
problem.
and
that
seems
to
me
--
i'm
not
even
sure
that
the
petitioners
assert
that
here.
clearly,
the
--
the
broad
scope
of
this
statute
is
--
is
constitutional,
and
whatever
aspects
of
speech
it
may
run
afoul
of
are
--
are
minimal.
that
being
the
case,
of
what
relevance
are
these
hypotheticals?
it's
a
lot
of
fun,
and
it's
very
interesting,
but
we
can
deal
with
all
of
that
when
the
situations
arise,
can't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you're
in
an
overbreadth
situation,
a
vagueness
challenge
can
be
an
as-applied
challenge.
a
statute
can
be
vague
as
applied
to
certain
conduct,
although
the
core
conduct
that
it
covers
is
clearly
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
cases
like
that.
