justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
another
discretion
that
you
don't
seem
to
object
to.
you
say
that
one
--
one
way
the
debtor
can
get
out
of
the
bind
that
he's
put
in
by
the
fixing
of
the
confirmed
plan
is
simply
to
move
for
a
revision
of
the
confirmed
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
constrains
the
judge
in
allowing
or
not
allowing
the
revision?
doesn't
he
have
the
same
kind
of
discretion
with
regard
to
the
revision
that
you're
objecting
to
with
regard
to
his
establishing
the
payments?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
same
thing
that's
being
argued
here,
that
--
that
you
start
with
the
fixed
calculation
based
on
the
6
months
before
and
then
you
have
to
show
that
there
were
some
extraordinary
circumstances
that
justify
a
change.
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
your
case
comes
down
to
is
the
bankruptcy
court
can
do
this,
but
it
has
to
do
it
by
simply
revising
the
plan,
not
by
establishing
the
plan
initially
but
by
revising
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a
friendly
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
come
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
whether
there
would
ever
be
the
opportunity
to
adjust
the
confirmed
plan?
because
as
you
say,
the
plan
here
would
not
have
been
confirmed,
but
that
--
that
isn't
the
case
always.
i
mean,
in
many
cases
a
plan
would
be
confirmed
because
the
--
the
bankrupt
could
--
could
barely
make
the
payments
that
it
requires;
and
then
when
it
--
it
is
clear
that,
because
of
the
extraordinary
event
in
the
preceding
6
months,
the
bankrupt
is
--
is
not
going
to
have
that
--
that
amount
of
money,
there
would
be
the
opportunity
to
adjust.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
is
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg
"always",
that
it
will
always
be
the
case
that
where
there
would
be
an
adjustment
under
this
theory,
there
would
not
have
been
a
confirmation
in
the
first
place?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
--
yes,
there
is
one
more
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
whether
1323,
which
you
have
now
invoked,
does
not
provide
the
same
kind
of
discretion
to
the
court
that
you
are
objecting
to?
what
--
what
standards
are
there
for
granting
or
not
granting
modification
of
the
plan?
is
it
pretty
much
up
to
the
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
--
then
--
okay.
you
are
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place.
either
1323
gets
you
out
of
that
formula,
which
is
what
you've
said,
it's
one
way
out,
or
it
isn't.
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
any
--
any
amendment
has
to
relate
to
a
period--
justice
antonin
scalia
--subsequent
to
the
filing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
--
you
have
lost
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
the
6-month--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
got
--
i
got
it
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
--
i
see.
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
"know
will
happen"
is
quite
different
from
"likely
to
happen",
and
i
thought
your
test
was
likely
to
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
--
not
likely,
based
on
what
you
know.
well,
that's
quite
different
from
you
know
it
will
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
a
difference
between
your
test
and
the
respondent's
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
"know
will
happen".
that
is
"know
will
happen".
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can,
at
one
and
the
same
time,
say:
courts
shall
not
speculate,
and
then
say
that
the
test
is
"likely
to
happen".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
to
--
you
know,
to
look
forward
and
say:
is
it
likely
or
not
likely?
that's
speculation.
i
don't
know
a
better
definition
of
speculation,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
