chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-998,
hamilton,
the
chapter
13
trustee,
v.
lanning.
mr.
hamilton.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
review
of
the
determination
or
the
request
to
move
the
period
is
--
is
what?
up
to
the
total
discretion
of
the
--
of
the
judge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
objection
to
the
fact
that
the
judge
has
more
discretion
with
respect
to
defining
"projected
disposable"
--
you
don't
mind
the
discretion
on
the
other
side.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
but
the
only
purpose
of
moving
the
time
period
is
to
change
the
income.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
a
good
answer,
isn't
it,
because
your
point
would
be
the
statute
does
not
allow
that
exercise
of
discretion
with
respect
to
projected
disposable
income,
but
it
does
in
the
other
areas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
my
--
my
point
and
what
i
thought
your
point
would
be
is
that
the
fact
that
there
is
exercise
of
discretion
in
two
different
areas
is
not
the
problem.
the
problem
is
that
in
one
area
the
discretion
is
specifically
permitted
and
in
the
other
area,
projected
disposable
income,
it's
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that,
by
the
way,
the
provision
that
allows
it
to
move
the
6-month
period?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
follow
his
suggestion
and
just
move
the
6-month
period,
because
the
statute
specifically
grants
that
authority
to
the
judge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that's
exactly
right
when
you
look
at
term
"projected
disposable
income".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you
look
as
"disposable
income"--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--as
a
defined
term
and
then
add
"projected",
i
think
it's
a
different
--
different
--
different
argument,
different
kettle
of
fish.
i
mean,
because
particularly
in
a
statute
intended
to
restrict
discretion,
it's
a
way
to
do
it.
you
look
at
it
in
the
abstract,
"projected
disposable
income",
it
doesn't
achieve
that
objective.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
--
you
wanted
to
achieve
your
friend's
result
and
you
had
a
definition
of
disposable
income,
and
you
wanted
the
court
to
--
you
don't
want
to
say
project
that
forward,
what
--
what
word
would
be
more
natural
than
saying
projected?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that's
altering
disposable
income
--
the
definition
of
disposable
income.
i'm
asking
isn't
the
most
natural
word
to
achieve
your
friend's
result
to
use
projected.
what
other
word
would
you
say
when
you
say
this
is
the
period
you
look
at
and
you
want
to
take
it
forward?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
harrington.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that,
particularly
since
you
are
adopting
a
fairly
broad
--
well,
depending
on
how
broad
a
theory
you
are
adopting
of
what's
projected
and
what's
not,
that
you
are
taking
into
account
a
lot
of
things
that
are
more
properly
taken
into
account
when
it
comes
to
whether
the
plan
should
be
confirmed
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
going
to
happen?
what's
the
situation
going
to
be?
what
should,
you
know,
the
creditors
get?
what
should
the
debtor
get?
there
is
no
reason
to
kind
of
shoehorn
those
into
the
projected
disposable
income.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
i
mean,
let's
say
your
friend
wins
up
to
the
point
and
somebody
else,
when
it
gets
to
confirmation,
can
say:
well,
look,
you
know,
there
was
this
big
payout
before
the
filing.
so
don't
confirm
it.
we
know
she
has
got
all
this
--
all
this
other
money.
that
--
it
could
do
it
that
way,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
whatever
the
situation
is,
can't
that
be
taken
into
account
when
it
comes
to
confirmation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
creditor
has
the
option
of
objecting
the
confirmation
of
the
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
can't
say:
i
object
because
the
6-month
period
is
unrepresentative
because
of
this
particular
event?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
government
have
a
position
on
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
the
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
harrington.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hamilton,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
an
opinion
in
this
morning
in
case
08-998,
hamilton
versus
lanning.
