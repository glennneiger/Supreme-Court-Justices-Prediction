but
in
a
sense
that
cuts
against
you.
as
i
was
--
when
i
was
reading
your
opening
brief,
it
seemed
to
me
the
tone
was,
well,
if
you
accept
the
respondent's
position
congress
did
nothing
at
all.
well,
they
did
do
something
very
important.
they
had
a
formula
for
disposable
income.
the
question
is,
does
that
formula
apply
to
projected?
can
that
formula
be
modified
altered
or
projected
for
projected?
so
it's
not
as
if
congress
did
nothing
or
it's
not
as
if
the
amendment
accomplishes
nothing
even
under
the
respondent's
view.
it
accomplished
something
very
important.

what
--
where
can
you
move
it?
i
don't
really
--
this
is
the
same
line
of
inquiry
as
justice
ginsburg.
what's
the
--
what
has
to
be
the
ending
date
if
you
move
the
--
you
can't
move
it
any
--
much
beyond
the
date
of
what,
the
hearing?
justice
anthony

without
the
word
"projected"?
