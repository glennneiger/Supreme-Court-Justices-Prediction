mr.
jan
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tenth
circuit
and
stephanie
lanning
were
wrong
in
ignoring
the
new
chapter
13
means
test
contained
in
the
2005
amendments
to
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
amendments
to
the
2005
bankruptcy
code
were
intended
to
reduce
judicial
discretion
by
inserting
a
formula
rather
than
the
judicial
discretion
that
had
previously
been
accorded
to
judges
and
to
the
litigants.
stephanie
lanning
fell
afoul
of
the
means
test
because
during
the
first
2
months
of
a
6-month
lookback
period,
which
i
will
explain
in
a
moment,
she
had
more
income
than
what
she
had
in
the
rest
of
the
6-month
lookback
period.
that
income
was
from
a
buyout
from
her
former
employer,
payless,
and
distorted
what
her
income
appeared
to
be
during
that
6-month
period
of
time.
because
of
that,
the
amount
which
the
means
test
showed
that
she
would
be
required
to
pay
to
her
creditors
was
more
than
she
could
actually
pay.
mr.
jan
hamilton
what
happens
to
her
and
what
could
have
happened
to
her
may
be
two
different
propositions,
justice
ginsburg.
in
the
first
place,
there
are
two
parts
to
that
6-month
lookback
period,
which
are
found
in
101(10a)
of
the
united
states
bankruptcy
code
--
and
the
statutes,
by
the
way
here,
are
found
at
pages
83
through
96
of
the
petition
appendix.
101(10a)
has
a
first
part
which
defines
the
6-month
lookback
period
as
being
6
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
date
of
the
petition
--
actually,
the
end
of
the
month
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition.
congress's
thought
was,
it
seems,
that
that
would
be
more
representative
of
what
an
individual's
actual
income
would
be.
there
is
a
second
part
to
that
6-month
lookback
period
which
says
essentially
that
the
debtor
can
move
that
6-month
lookback
period
by
not
filing
certain
papers
with
the
court.
mr.
jan
hamilton
the
part
of
the
statute
that
you
are
referring
to
is
under
523,
and
it
essentially
says
that
debtor
shall
file
--
521,
excuse
me
--
shall
file
certain
schedules
and
that
would
include
the
income
and
expense
schedules,
schedule
i
and
schedule
j.
and
certainly
the
court
has
the
ability,
under
that
statute,
to
extend
the
time
or
to
excuse
the
performance
of
a
debtor
in
that
regard.
so
there's
nothing
incongruous
about
that
wording
in
the
statute.
mr.
jan
hamilton
certainly
all
of
those
time
frames
can
be
moved,
justice
sotomayor.
there
is
--
again,
the
actual
timing
of
the
confirmation
hearing
in
a
chapter
13
case
may
be
fluid,
although
there
are
certain
time
limits
for
the
first
meeting
of
creditors
and
for
when
the
first
--
when
the
confirmation
hearing
is
held.
they
can
be
extended,
just
as
the
confirmation
hearing
would
be
in
a
chapter
12
or
in
a
chapter
11
case.
so
the
idea
is
the
second
part
of
101(10a)
allows
the
debtor
to
say:
your
honor,
my
6-month
time
frame
immediately
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
is
not
representative
of
my
income;
i
would
like
to
have
that
time
frame
moved.
and
that
time
frame
would
appear
to
be
moveable
up
to
the
confirmation
hearing.
mr.
jan
hamilton
no,
your
honor.
that
would
be
up
to
the
court.
it
would
be
discretionary
with
the
court,
as
the
language
suggests
in
the
second
part
of
101(10a).
mr.
jan
hamilton
certainly
prior
to
the
2005
amendments,
your
assessment
is
correct.
the
court
had
the
discretion
to
be
able
to
assess
the
debtor's
situation,
use
its
discretion
to
determine
what
income
and
expenses
should
be
calculated
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
debtor
was
paying
his
or
her
best
efforts
under
1325(b)(1).
here,
there
is
a
clear
formula.
and
if
you
read
these
--
there
are
three,
three
key
statutes
that
form
a
triangle
in
order
to
give
me
the
conclusion
that
i
make
and
that
i
suggest
to
your
honor.
and
that
is,
we
start
with
1325(b)(1),
which
is
the
statute
that
brings
into
play
the
disposable
income
and
projected
disposable
income
requirements.
"disposable
income"
is
now
defined
as
"current
monthly
income".
mr.
jan
hamilton
respectfully,
justice
alito,
i
don't
any
agree
with
the
assessment
that
--
of
what
you
just
stated.
essentially,
this
formula
allows
the
bankruptcy
court
to
move
that
6-month
period
of
time,
not
to
ignore
the
formula.
the
formula's
there.
the
formula
defines
"current
monthly
income".
from
the
current
monthly
income
then
is
subtracted
reasonable
and
necessary
expenses.
and
formerly,
under
the
old
law,
the
'78
code,
those
reasonable
and
necessary
expenses
contained
a
few
specifics,
but
largely
it
was
up
to
the
court
to
determine
them.
mr.
jan
hamilton
in
--
under
101(10a),
the
second
part,
yes.
but
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
some
other
--
other
avenues
for
the
debtor
that
are
statutory.
mr.
jan
hamilton
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
jan
hamilton
well,
there
--
there
are
a
couple
of
avenues.
there
is
a
new
statutory
provision
under
1325(a)(7)
that
says
the
plan
must
be
filed
in
good
faith
and
--
i'm
sorry,
the
petition
must
be
filed
in
good
faith.
1325(a)(3)
provides
that
the
petition
must
be
filed
in
good
faith.
so
we
still
have
the
good
faith
analysis
that
the
debtor's
actions
may
be
subjected
to
even
after
the
plan
is
filed.
and
that
would
be
as
trustee
the
avenue
that
i
would
approach
is
that,
even
though
the
schedule
formula
may
have
been
complied
with,
that
if
there
had
been
a
drastic
increase
in
income
post-petition,
then
that
--
that
should
need
to
be
accounted
for.
mr.
jan
hamilton
my
answer,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
congress
provided
the
formula,
and
it's
not
up
to
the
courts,
i
suggest,
to
modify
that
formula.
part
of
the--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--two
points,
justice
sotomayor.
one
is
that
there
was
no
formula
before.
there
was
some
general
guidance
that
was
given
in
the
statute.
it's
much
like
the
proposition
of
good
faith.
good
faith
is
almost
incapable
of
definition,
yet
every
circuit
in
the
united
states
has
a
laundry
list
of
factors
that
are
taken
into
account
for
good
faith.
here,
reasonable
and
necessary
expenses
under
the
old
law
had
a
few
suggestions
as
to
what
needed
to
be
involved
with
them.
now
we
have
a
portion
of
another
part
of
the
triangle,
which
is
under
707(b).
mr.
jan
hamilton
my
answer,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
definition
of
the
word,
quote,
"projected",
end
of
quote,
has
--
there's
never
has
been
one
in
the
code.
that
was
a
term
that
was
in
the
1978
code
and
is
carried
over
into
the
present
code.
how
it
was
applied
is
vastly
different.
the
dispute
under
the
prior
law
was
over
whether
or
not
the
court
could
take
into
account
changes
in
circumstances
which
were
likely
to
occur
post-confirmation.
and
so
we
had
cases
like
the
anderson
v.
satterlee
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
midkiff
case
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
that
disagreed
as
to
how
that
ought
to
be
applied.
in
the
anderson
v.
satterlee
case
the
chapter
13
trustee
requested
that
the
debtor
sign
essentially
a
pledge
that
they
would
devote
their
excess
income
to
the
plan,
and
the
anderson
court
said:
wait
a
minute;
there
is
another
statute
at
issue
here
and
that
is
1329.
1329
allows
for
the
modification
of
the
plan
after
the
plan
has
been
confirmed.
prior
to
the
confirmation
of
the
plan,
the
debtor
still
has
the
ability
--
and
this
ties
in
with
some
of
the
comments
made
by
justice
alito
--
the
debtor
still
has
the
ability
to
amend
the
plan
under
1323.
so
all
of
these
statutes
need
to
be
read
together
to
show
what
the
result
is.
now
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
changes
should
be
taken
into
account
for
post-confirmation
that
may
be
likely
to
occur,
but
whether
or
not
the
court
may
deviate
from
the
statute
where
congress
has
said
this
is
how
we
want
you
to
determine
current
monthly
income,
therefore
disposable
income
and
consequently
projected
disposable
income.
mr.
jan
hamilton
no,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
that
privilege
is
accorded
only
to
the
debtor
to
move
that
6-month
period.
neither
the
unsecured
creditors
nor
the
trustee
have
the
ability
to
request
that
that
6-month
period
be
moved.
mr.
jan
hamilton
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
or
not
that
occurred.
mr.
jan
hamilton
it
would
be
up
to
confirmation,
but
the
confirmation
hearing
could
be
continued
as
the
court
saw
fit.
mr.
jan
hamilton
it
appears
to
be
so
under
the
statute,
chief
justice
roberts.
mr.
jan
hamilton
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
discretion
is
not
in
determining
the
income,
only
in
determining
the
time
period.
mr.
jan
hamilton
that's
true.
and
there
are
other
options
that
the
debtor
had
available
in
addition
to
that,
that
we
have
referred
to
as
the
four
options,
which
would
be
the
debtor
could
have
here
just
delayed
filing
the
case
for
a
couple
of
months
and
these
problems
would
not
have
occurred.
mr.
jan
hamilton
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jan
hamilton
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
so.
1329
has
been
subject
to
quite
a
bit
of
litigation,
but
the
argument
that
we
make
in
our
reply
brief
is
that
it
would
be
simply
necessary
to
plug
in
and
plug
out
whatever
the
change
in
circumstance
is.
so
the
debtor
would
be
able
to
say,
my
wife's
income
is
now
gone,
so
we
want
to
take
that
out
of
the
formula.
mr.
jan
hamilton
there
may
not
be,
except
that
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
as
to
how
that
is
accomplished
and
that's
where
the
101(10a)(ii)
comes
into
play.
it's
not
so
much
that
there
is
a
problem
with--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
that
certainly
is
one
way.
mr.
jan
hamilton
it
may
be,
yes.
it
depends
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
jan
hamilton
well,
again
i
respectfully
disagree,
chief
justice
roberts.
1329--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--i'm
sorry?
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
jan
hamilton
i
agree.
[laughter]
mr.
jan
hamilton
that
depends
on
which
jurisdiction
one
would
be
in,
justice
alito.
the
most
current
example--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--i
think
it
should
be.
for
example,
a
good
example
of
this
would
be
debtor
is
expected
2
years
from
now
to
no
longer
have
to
repay
a
401(k)
loan.
and
so
one
view
would
be
that
you
ought
to
take
that
into
account
as
of
that
date
and
figure
those
calculations,
which
becomes
extremely
unwieldy.
you
are
guessing
at
that
point.
the
debtor
may
say:
well,
i
may
be
losing
that,
but
i
don't
know
what
my
actual
circumstances
are
going
to
be
2
years
from
now.
chapter
13
is
a
fluid
process.
mr.
jan
hamilton
no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
my
argument.
mr.
jan
hamilton
well,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
plan
cannot
be
confirmed
as
it
stands
because
the
debtor
would
have
to
be
able
to
make
those
payments
and
the
debtor
obviously
is
not
capable
of
making
those
payments.
but
it's
because
she
chose
the
wrong
options.
if
she
had
chosen
the--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--well,
i
agreed
with
that.
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
question
that
i
was
asked.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
statute
needs
to
be
followed
and
if
the
debtor
had
followed
the
statutes
here
then
the
debtor
likely
could
have
obtained
a
confirmed
plan
by
moving
that
6-month
time
frame.
mr.
jan
hamilton
yes.
well,
the
other
options
--
and
i
referred
to
them
as
the
four
options
and
the
101(10a)(ii)
is
one
of
those
options.
as
i
said,
she
could
have
delayed
filing
the
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
schedules
that
would
indicate
that
she
was
filing
this
bankruptcy
under
exigent
circumstances.
there
is
no
foreclosure,
there
is
no
repossession,
there's
no
garnishment,
there's
no
lawsuit.
so
delay
would
have
been
a
possible,
and
a
debtor
is
always
able
to
determine
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
the
second
thing
that
she
could
have
done
is
file
a
chapter
7,
and
this
is
the
anomaly
between
chapter
13
and
chapter
7,
is
that
she
would
have
qualified
in
all
likelihood
for
a
discharge
under
chapter
7
because
she
would
have
met
the
special
circumstances
test
in
707(b).
mr.
jan
hamilton
that's
very
possible,
but
it's
a
formula
that
congress
thought
to
place
into
effect
and
it's
not--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--here,
justice
ginsburg,
the
reason
is
plain
and
simple,
and
that
was
i
sought
to
enforce
the
rule
of
law
in
order
to
have
the
courts
determine
how
the
rules
were
supposed
to
be
interpreted.
by
my
view,
it
seemed
like
that
had
she
followed
the
rules
maybe
she
would
have
gotten
there,
but
the
way
she
did
it
she
can't.
it's
kind
of
like
driving
a
car.
you
can't
expect
that
a
the
car
is
going
to
perform
well
if
you
don't
turn
the
engine
on.
mr.
jan
hamilton
and
here
she
didn't
turn
the
engine
on.
mr.
jan
hamilton
maybe
not
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jan
hamilton
if
the
plan
is
not
confirmable
by
an
analysis
of
schedules
i
and
j,
which
are
the
income
and
expenses
statutes,
i
am
not
going
to
recommend
confirmation,
and
nor
do
i
think
any
trustee
would.
any
events
that
are
in
the
equation
before
the
date
of
confirmation
would
likely
be
then
subject
to
1327,
the
res
judicata
provisions
of
chapter
13.
so
if
the
plan
is
confirmed,
say
in
stephanie
lanning's
case,
with
these
facts
known,
then
she
would
not
be
able
to
come
in
afterwards
and
ask
for
the
court
to
modify
under
1329
because
that's
part
of
the
confirmation
order.
the
other
options
that
were
available
--
we
discussed
briefly
the
ability
to
file
this
as
a
chapter
7.
she
also
could
have
converted
this
case
to
a
chapter
7
post-petition
with
the
same
result,
or
she
could
have
dismissed
this
case
and
refiled.
mr.
jan
hamilton
because,
justice
ginsburg,
the
statute
does
not
permit
that.
it's
not
within
the
formula,
and
that's
the
question:
is
the
formula
binding
or
is
it
not
binding?
if
it
is
binding
then
this
--
obviously.
congress
intended
a
more
rule-bound
statute.
it
got
that.
it
was
obvious
that
it
intended
to
reduce
judicial
discretion,
and
the
statute
seems
to
accomplish
that.
mr.
jan
hamilton
only
in
moving
the
6-month
period,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jan
hamilton
that
would
be
the
only
discretion
that
the
statute
would
appear
to
accord
to
the
court.
mr.
jan
hamilton
it's
in
101(10a)
and
it
provides
that
the
term
6-month
period
ending
on
--
and
then
we
come
to
subsections
(i),
little
(i)
--
or
(ii).
and
those
are
--
that's
the
disjuncture;
it's
the
6-month
period
prior
or
some
other
time
frame,
and
the
language
is
important.
mr.
jan
hamilton
well,
justice
alito,
i
think
i
would
tie
in
1323
with
respect
to
the
first
proposition,
and
that
is
if
the
debtor's
circumstances
have
markedly
changed,
then
the
debtor
has
the
ability
to
file
an
amended
plan;
and
that
amended
plan
could
ask
the
court
to
move
that
time
frame
forward
to
a
confirmation
hearing
that
would
take
into
account
the
drop
in
income.
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
your
proposition,
and
that
is
an
increase
in
income,
then
i
as
chapter
13
trustee
would
have
the
ability
to
object
to
it
on
the
basis
of
--
of
good
faith
under
either
1325(a)(3)
or
1325(a)(7),
either
the
plan
or
the
filing
of
the
case
itself.
and
those
--
the
filing
of
the
1325(a)(3)
was
the
primary
way
in
which
all
of
these
disputes
were
resolved
before
the
1984
amendments
which
brought
in
subsection
(b)
to
1325
which
introduced
the
concept
of
disposable
income.
mr.
jan
hamilton
those
are--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--those
are
two
different
propositions,
your
honor.
one
is
if
the
plan
is
confirmed
and
one
if
it
is
not
confirmed.
if
it
is
not
confirmed,
then
you
are
correct;
at
some
point
the
trustee
and
the
court
are
going
to
want
to
see
a
schedule
i
and
j
to
see
what
the
actual
income
and
expenses
are.
if
the
plan
has
already
been
confirmed,
then
the
ability
to
change
the
plan
has
to
be
done
under
1329,
which
is--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--i
don't
agree
with
the
word
"jurisdiction",
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
jan
hamilton
the
debtor
would
certainly
have
the
ability
to
ask
the
court
to
be
excused
from
that
requirement
given
a
change
in
circumstances.
but
again
it
would
be
the
formula
that
would
be
honored,
rather
than
the
court
substituting
judicial
discretion.
if
there--
mr.
jan
hamilton
--okay.
mr.
jan
hamilton
no.
i
believe
again
the
court
is
bound,
justice
scalia,
by
the
101(10a)
formula.
it's
obvious
that
congress
intended
the
formula.
it
would
not
make
much
sense
to
read
the
statute
to
have
some
other
formula.
mr.
jan
hamilton
i
haven't
said
that
it
gets
me
out
of
the
formula.
it
gets
me
out
of
the
time
frame
issue,
because
certainly
the
statute
doesn't
take
into
specific
account
what
happens
if
the
debtor
loses
a
job,
say,
post-petition?
obviously
--
example,
husband
loses
the
job
at
goodyear
after
the
bankruptcy
petition
is
filed.
and
i
think
1323
is
broad
enough
to
allow
an
amendment
which
would
involve
only
moving
the
time
frame.
mr.
jan
hamilton
i
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jan
hamilton
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
chief
justice
roberts.
mr.
jan
hamilton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
note
that
the
plan
is
not
confirmed
in
this
case;
this
was
an
interlocutory
appeal.
there
is
an
amended
order
at
the
bap
level
that
allows
it
as
an
interlocutory
appeal.
so
the
debtor
still
has
preconfirmation
options,
rather
than
having
to
rely
upon
1329
or
something
else
in
the
record.
secondly
i
want
to
point
out
that
1325
as
has
been
suggested
by
justice
ginsburg
only
incorporates
a
part
of
707(b),
and
the
part
it
doesn't
incorporate
is
the
special
circumstances
on
the
income
side.
it
only
incorporates
special
circumstances
on
the
expense
side.
the
significance
of
that
is
that
what
has
been
substituted
for
special
circumstances
on
the
income
side
is
the
101(10a)
formula
minus
certain
expenses
from
707(b).
the
certain
expenses
from
707(b)
are
not
a
wild
card.
they
are
irs
standards
in
certain
other
specially
defined
circumstances.
the
idea
that
this
would
allow
a
phantom
car
payment
--
no,
we
don't
think
so.
there
is
language
in
that
section
that
says
that
the
expenses
have
to
be
applicable
and
actual.
and
one
case
recently
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ransom
case,
says
that.
you
have
to
look
at
the
language
in
707(b)
in
order
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
expenses,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
applicability
of
the
6-month
time
frame.
what
the
government
and
what
the
respondent
choose
to
do
here
is
to
basically
gut
the
entire
means
test
based
upon
one
word,
and
that's
"projected".
and
they
choose
to
use
an
undefined
term
"projected"
over
the
statutory
language
that
congress
chose
to
determine
what
debtors
should
pay
to
their
creditors,
and
it's
a
congressional
choice.
and
as
many
commentators
have
suggested,
if
there
is
a
remedy
here,
it
is
a
congressional
remedy
and
not
a
judicial
remedy.
thank
you.
