ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
bankruptcy,
as
in
many
areas
of
the
law,
congress
has
tried
to
balance
on
the
one
hand,
doing
case-specific
justice,
and
on
the
other
hand,
ensuring
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
administrable.
now,
congress
certainly
could
have
chosen
to
elevate
simplicity
over
accuracy
by
telling
bankruptcy
courts
to
take
a
debtor's
current
disposable
income
and
multiply
that
number
by
the
number
of
months
in
the
plan
in
assessing
whether
the
plan
is
confirmable.
but
there
are
several
strong
signals
in
the
code
that
that
is
actually
not
what
congress
intended
courts
to
do.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
certainly
not,
justice
alito.
bankruptcy--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
bankruptcy
courts
--
we
are
not
saying
that
bankruptcy
courts
should
ever
speculate
about
what
might
happen
in
the
future.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
bankruptcy
courts
should
take
into
account
what
they
know,
in
this
case,
already
has
happened,
but
also
what
they
know
will
happen.
and
so
to
give
an
example
of
a
change
that
would
benefit
creditors,
if
as
--
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
if
a
debtor
has
secured
a
higher-paying
job
just
before
or
just
after
she
filed
her
petition,
a
court
should
be
able
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
her
income
going
forward
would
be
greater
than
would
be
reflected
in
the
calculation
of
her
current
disposable
income.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
likely
to
happen
based
on
what
you
know
now.
i
think
--
we
haven't
suggested
a
particular
burden
of
proof.
i
think--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--right.
so
there
is
an
example
mentioned
earlier:
if
the
debtor
is
repaying
a
loan
to
her
401(k)
program,
that
is
the
type
of
loan
that
can't
be
extended
time-wise.
and
so
she
will
keep
making
those
payments,
which
will
be
deducted
as
an
expense
in
the
calculation
of
her
current
disposable
income,
but
--
but
you
know
at
a
certain
point,
she
is
likely
to
stop
making
those
payments.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
not
according
to
what
i
heard
mr.
goldstein
say
at
the
argument.
again,
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
a
court
should
use--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
think,
in
part,
it
depends
on
what
type
of
change
you
are
talking
about.
again,
we
would
never
say
that
a
court
should
speculate
about
what
should
happen.
but,
for
instance,
to
take
another
example
on
the
expense
side,
if
a
debtor
when
she
proposes
her
plan
owns
a
second
home,
a
vacation
home
that
is
secured
by
a
mortgage,
then
that
secured
debt
payment
is
an
expense
that
would
be
deducted
from
her
income
in
the
calculation
of
her
current
disposable
income.
but
if
she
proposes
to
surrender
that
property
as
a
condition
of
her
plan,
she
will
no
longer
have
that
debt
payment
going
forward.
and
so
that's
the
type
of
--
so
it
will
no
longer
be
an
expense
going
forward.
under
petitioner's
view,
a
court
would
not
be
able
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
that
current
expense--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
again,
in
this--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--okay.
but
then,
we
wouldn't
--
we
are
not
trying
to
advance
that
view
of
"likely".
and
again,
in
this
case
the
change
had
already
occurred,
so
there
is
no
uncertainty
about
what
her
situation
is
now
and
what
we
can
project
it
to
be
going
forward.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
this
is--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
except
that
if
the
creditor
or
a
trustee
objects,
then
the
calculation
of
projected
disposable
income
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
confirmability
of
the
plan.
the
court
can't
confirm
it
unless
it
can--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i'm
sorry,
if
she
got
a
higher-paying
job
just
before?
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
it
could
affect
the
--
well,
one
thing
that
is
important
to
note
that
hasn't
been
brought
up
is
under
section
1325(a)(6),
the
court
is
actually
--
which
is
the
feasibility
provision
--
the
court
is
actually
required
to
think
about
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
future,
whether
a
debtor
is
going
to
be
able
to
repay
her
creditors.
and
so
it
doesn't
make
very
much
sense
to,
on
the
one
hand,
require
a
court
to
consider
what
it
knows
will
happen
in
the
future
in
determining
feasibility,
and
then
on
the
other
hand,
if
there's
an
objection
by
the
creditor
or
the
trustee
and
1325(b)
comes
into
play,
to
prohibit
a
court
from
considering
the
same
facts
it
knows
about
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
future--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
i
think
one
purpose
of
having
the
6-month
lookback
period
in
the
calculation
of
current
income
is
exactly
to
take
into
account
those
situations.
there
are
many
people
who
are
gainfully
employed
full
time,
but
whose
--
whose
income
fluctuates
over
time.
and
so
requiring
that
courts
use
the
6-month
lookback
period,
i
think,
gives
creditors
a
better
sense
of
whether
the
current
income
figure
provided
by
the
debtor
is
accurate.
it
reduces
the
chance
for
strategic
filing
because
it
sort
of
takes
some
of
the
significance
away
of
the
time
of
filing.
and
so
it
seems
fairer
in
that
case
to
consider
that
6-month
average
in
a
case
where
income
fluctuates
up
and
down
as
an
accurate
sense
of
what
the
--
what
the
debtor's
current
income
is.
and
again,
in
many
--
in
a
significant
number
of
cases
the
calculation
of
a
current
disposable
income
will
be
a
good
prediction
of
what
the
debtor's
disposable
income
will
be
going
forward.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
the
special
circumstances
exception
comes
in,
in
the
calculation
of
the
debtor's
current
disposable
income,
but
it
doesn't
tell
you
what
to
do
in
terms
of
projecting
that
disposable
income.
and
so
you
can
adjust
what
you
think
the
current
disposable
income
is
based
on
an
expense
that
isn't
accounted
for
in
the
standard
expenses
or
an
expense
that
is
accounted
for,
but
is
higher
than
is
accounted
for
in
those
expenses.
but
again,
it
doesn't
tell
you
what
to
do
--
how
to
project
that
number
going
forward.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
that
is
certainly
true
of
this
debtor,
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
that
is
not
an
option
available
to
all
debtors,
many
of
whom
are
facing
foreclosure
proceedings
or
imminent
foreclosure
proceedings.
delay
is
simply
not
an
option.
and
if
i
could
address
section
101(10a)(a)(ii)
option
that
the
petitioner
offers
--
i
mean,
one
thing
to
note
is
it
doesn't
give
the
court
the
discretion
to
set
any
other
--
to
just
pick
any
other
6-month
lookback
period.
they
pick
a
date
and
go
6
months
back
from
whatever
that
date
is.
so
if
a
change
occurs
very
soon
before
the
filing
of
the
petition,
it
makes
it
very
hard
for
a
court
to
use
that
provision
to
change
the
lookback
period
because
you
would
have
to
wait
6
months,
essentially,
after
the
filing
of
the
petition
to
set
it
back.
but
again,
the
biggest
problem
with
using
that
section
as
a
workaround
is
that
that
is
an
option
that
is
available
to
debtors,
but
not
to
creditors.
if
a
debtor
files
a
chapter
13
petition
along
with
all
the
schedules
that
are
required
under
section
521
of
the
code,
then
the
debtor
has
no
option
for
--
excuse
me,
the
creditor
has
no
option
and
the
trustee
has
no
option--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--they
can
object
to
confirmation
of
the
plan,
but
on
what
--
what
basis?
if
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
calculation
of
projected
disposable
income
is
merely
a
mechanical
multiplication
of
the
current
disposable
income
times
60
or
36,
then
they
have
no
way
of
allowing
the
court
to
take
account
of
a
change
that
has
happened
just
before
or
after
the
time
of
the
petition
that
would
inure
to
the
creditor's
benefit.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
they
could
say
that,
but
it's
not
clear
in
the
code
that
that
is
a
basis
for
refusing
to
confirm
a
plan.
i
think
they
would
have
to
make
the
argument
that--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
think
unless
there
were
bad
faith
it's
not
clear
how
that
can
be
a
basis
for
not
confirming
a
plan,
and
that
was
the
--
the
reason
that
my
friend
on
petitioner's
counsel
suggested.
but
again,
it's
not
clear
how
that
would
be
bad
faith,
if
a
debtor
proposes
a
plan
that
--
that
commits
all
of
her
projected
disposable
income
under
the
trustee's
view
of
what
that
number
is,
it's
hard
to
see
how
you
could
say
that
that
was
a
plan
that
was
proposed
in
bad
faith.
so
again,
i
just
want
to
--
just
to
respond
to
the
--
the
argument
that
the
government
in
respondent's
view
reads
the
6-month
period
totally
out
of
the
code--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--okay.
the
calculation
of
a
--
a
debtor's
current
disposable
income
will
often
be
a
reliable
predictor
of
her
future
disposable
income
and
when
that's
the
case,
then
a
reliable
way
of
projecting
is
simply
be
multiplying.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
thank
you.
