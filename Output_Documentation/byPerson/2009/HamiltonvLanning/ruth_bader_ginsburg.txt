justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
means
--
which
means
what?
what
is
the
consequence
of
that?
you
concede
that
on
the
strict
application
of
the
6
months
she
--
her
income
is
much
too
high
for
her
possibly
to
pay
the
creditors.
so
what
happens
to
her?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
--
can
you
explain
that?
it
seems
very
odd.
it
says
she
can
do
that
if
she
doesn't
do
what
the
statute
requires
her
to
do.
i
mean,
she's
supposed
to
file
that
schedule.
she's
required,
the
statute
says,
to
file
it.
but
she
gets
an
advantage
if
she
doesn't
do
what
she's
instructed
to
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
moveable
to
where?
what
--
what
would
be
--
you
say
--
this
time
period,
the
statutory
--
the
6-month
lookback,
she
has
these
2
extraordinary
months.
so
now
she's
going
to
say:
court,
please
change
the
period.
change
it
to
what?
anything
she
wants?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
already
told
us
that
there
could
be
a
deviation
through
this
101(10a)(ii).
and
why,
if
that
was
all
that
needed
to
be
done,
did
the
trustee
recommend,
did
the
trustee
say,
bankruptcy
judge,
let's
move
the
period,
let's
use
this
provision
and
we
will
get
another
period
that
doesn't
have
those
2
months
with
the
extraordinary
income?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
could
have
been
suggested
to
the
debtor:
you
can
accomplish
what
you
want
by
using
this
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let
me
just
stop
you
there,
because
then
the
answer
you
gave
to
the
chief
and
to
justice
scalia
doesn't
fit.
chief
--
you
can
not
--
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
not
going
to
confirm
the
plan
was
she
has
to
pay
over
$1,000
a
month,
because
she
could
never
do
that.
so
you
are
not
going
to
get
that
confirmed
plan
which
could
be
amended
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
in
addition
to
--
you
brought
up
the
101
solution
that
she
doesn't
do
what
the
statute
tells
her
to
do,
so
she's
able
to
move
it
if
the
judge
agrees.
and
you
said
she
has
other
options.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
the
creditors
would
have
been
a
lot
worse
off,
would
they
not
have
been?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
would
--
why
would
the
trustee
be
urging
the
possibility
that
it
would
be
okay
for
her
to
file
under
chapter
7,
in
which
case
the
unsecured
creditors
would
get
very
little,
but
it's
not
okay
for
her
to
use
chapter
13
with
a
plan
that
would
give
the
unsecured
creditors
substantial
payments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
amount
to
just
a
--
a
waste
of
everybody's
time,
to
dismiss
it
and
then
refile
it,
and
then
she
gets
a
time
period
that
doesn't
--
why
--
why
not
just
drop
out
those
2
months
that
are
not
representative
of
her
income?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
thing
is
--
but
you
have
explained,
your
number
one
solution
for
her
is
this
101
route,
which
is
--
gives
lots
of
discretion
in
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
deal
with
the
petitioner's
--
the
two
arguments
petitioner
makes?
one
is
that
on
the
expense
side,
congress
provided
for
special
circumstances,
exceptions,
and
it
didn't
on
the
income
side?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
this
is
a
simple
thing;
she
didn't
have
to
file
the
plan
--
she
didn't
have
to
file
the
petition
at
a
time
when
those
two
months
would
be
in
the
6-month
lookback.
she
could
have
waited.
