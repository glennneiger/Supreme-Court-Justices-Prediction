mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court,
i
think,
has
the
parties'
arguments
very
well
in
hand.
i
think
the
--
the
one
point
that
i
can
hopefully
address,
and
it
is
i
think
the
hardest
part
of
our
case,
is
to
address
the
issue
that
justice
alito
raised,
and
that
is,
is
there
an
anomaly
in
the
fact
that
in
bapcpa
congress
added
the
6-month
period,
which
would
suggest
perhaps
that
congress
was
trying
to
lock
in
a
particular
period
that
we
would
look
at.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
and
i
want
to
take
you
to
the
relevant
statutory
provisions.
everything
is
going
to
be
in
the
cert
petition.
i
am
going
to
start
in
the
petition
appendix
at
91,
which
is
1325,
which
is
the
operative
provision
here.
and
1325(b)(1)
tells
us
that
if
the
trustee
or
a
creditor
objects,
then
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
plan
it's
only
going
to
be
confirmed
in
subsection
(b),
which
is
the
third
full
paragraph
on
page
91
is
going
to
control.
the
plan
has
to
provide
that
all
of
the
debtor's
projected
disposable
income
to
be
received
in
the
applicable
commitment
period
beginning
on
the
date
the
first
payment
is
due
under
the
plan
will
be
applied
to
make
payments
to
unsecured
creditors
under
the
plan.
and
the
thing
to
note
first
about
that
provision
is
that
it,
too,
sets
a
timetable.
it's
not
just
projected
disposable
income,
but
it's
projected
disposable
income
of
a
very
particular
type,
to
be
received
in
the
applicable
commitment
period.
so
unless
there
is
something
particularly
strange
about
the
definition
of
"disposable
income",
congress
specified
a
period
that
the
income
is
going
to
be
measured
in,
and
that's
over
the
course
of
the
plan;
the
word
"projected"
tells
us
to
get
a
realistic
estimation
of
what
that
amount
of
money's
going
to
be.
now,
my
friend
makes
the
point
that
disposable
income
after
bapcpa
is
a
defined
term;
the
definition
comes
in
the
next
paragraph;
it's
subsection
(2),
1325(b)(2).
for
purposes
of
this
subsection
the
term
"disposable
income"
means
current
monthly
income
received
by
the
debtor
subject
to
some
deductions
and
then
the
expenses.
so
then
we
have
to
go
to
the
definition
of
"current
monthly
income".
current
monthly
income
is
in
101;
it's
at
page
83.
that's
where
we
get
the
6-month
period.
and
it
tells
us
that
current
monthly
income
is
the
average
monthly
income
from
all
sources,
so
it's
very
encompassing,
without
regard
to
whether
such
income
is
taxable
income
derived
during
the
6-month
period.
so,
my
friend's
argument
is
that,
well,
congress
said
6
months.
the
answer
to
that
point
is
a
couple
fold.
first,
as
was
suggested
in
the
first
half-hour,
congress
was
addressing
a
very
specific
problem
there.
before
bapcpa
courts
didn't
know
what
the
--
didn't
agree
on
what
the
baseline
was
for
determining
someone's
income.
some
courts
would
say,
all
right,
you
are
a
chapter
13
debtor,
right
away
i'm
going
to
look
at
the
latest
month.
some
courts
said
6
months.
we
have
a
court
in
our
brief
that
said
4
years.
so,
we
have
to
have
a
starting
point
to
project
from.
but
the
second
point
is
that
this
term
13
term
at
all.
so,
my
friend's
argument
is
that
congress
stuck
this
6-month
period
into
chapter
13,
so
it
would
be
very
anomalous
if
we
could
just
--
in
effect,
he
says
we
are
throwing
it
out,
we
are
giving
the
district
judges
discretion.
it's
not
quite
right.
the
place
to
look
is
in
section
707,
which
is
two
pages
later.
707
is
a
chapter
7
provision.
and
my
friend
started
out
by
saying
the
problem
with
our
position
is
that
we
were
not
following
the
chapter
7
means
test.
that's
the
key.
this
term
is
really
a
--
borrowed
from
chapter
7.
so
707(b)(2)(a)(i)
is
at
the
beginning
of
page
85
of
the
appendix.
and,
so,
we
are
in
a
chapter
7
case
here.
and
this
is
the
means
test.
it
tells
us
that:
1>
["],
so
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
if
there
is
a
presumption
of
abuse
under
chapter
7
--
"whether
the
granting
of
relief
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
provisions
of
this
chapter,
the
court
shall
presume
abuse
exists
if
the
debtor's
current
monthly
income,
reduced
by
the
amounts
determined
under
clauses
2,
3,
and
4.
"
--those
are
expense
clauses
--
"and
multiplied
by
60
is
not
less
than.
"
a
certain
amount.
so
what
happened
is
congress
in
bapcpa
created
this
presumption
of
abuse
in
chapter
7
and
it
then
borrowed
that
concept,
as
my
friend
pointed
out,
in
chapter
13.
so
that
6-month
period
has
real
force
and
effect
in
the
bankruptcy
code
in
chapter
7.
so
it's
not
like
congress
in
chapter
13
fixed
the
6-month
period,
which
would
give
--
have
a
sort
of
a
gravitational
pull.
you
wouldn't
want
to
throw
that
out
too
lightly.
justice
sotomayor,
i
do
agree
that
we
ought
to
be
pretty
--
we
ought
to
stick
to
it.
it
indicates
congress
is
concerned
with
the
6-month
period.
but
it's
not
like
congress
added
to
chapter
13
this
6-month
concept.
it
added
it
to
chapter
7,
where
it's
in
full
force
and
effect.
can
i
make
one
other
point
about
that
language,
just
to
repeat
it
again?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
it's
back.
we
have
to
go
back
two
pages.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
sure.
i'm
sorry.
the
term
is
"current
monthly
income".
so
we
are
in
chapter
7,
so
four
lines
down.
"the
court
shall
presume
abuse
exists
if
the
debtor's
current
monthly
income.
"
--that's
the
6
months,
current
monthly
income.
that's
the
6-month
period
of
income.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
see,
that's
mostly
where
it
matters.
then
congress
borrowed
it
in
chapter
13.
but
it
didn't
get
rid
of,
as
was
pointed
out
before,
the
term
--
"projected";
it
didn't
get
rid
of
the
period,
the
commitment
period.
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
something
very
particular
about
this
language.
here's
the
phrase:
"current
monthly
income,
reduced
by
the
amounts
determined
under
clauses
2,
3,
and
4.
"
--those
are
expenses
--
60>
["].
that's
what
my
friend
says
the
phrase
"projected
disposable
income
to
be
received
over
the
applicable
commitment
period
is.
"
our
point
is
that
if
congress
intended
that
mechanical
formulation,
it
would
have
used
the
exact
words
that
i
have
just
read
from
you
in
chapter
7,
because
that's
mechanical.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
exactly.
they
used
"multiplied".
and
congress
did
that
several
times
in
bapcpa
and
before
bapcpa.
when
congress
wanted,
look,
we
are
going
to
have
a
mathematical
formula,
it
used
a
mathematical
formula.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
let
me
make
a
few
points
about
that,
sir.
so
i'll
again
read
the
language
again.
so
we
are
on
83.
it
says
that
--
little
(ii)
is
going
to
be
--
it's
going
to
be
"6
months
ending
on
the
date
on
which
current
income
is
determined
by
the
court
for
purposes
of
this
title
if
the
debtor
does
not
file
the
schedule
of
current
income.
"
a
couple
of
points
about
that.
justice
alito,
you
were
right,
this
is
a
one-way
prodebtor
ratchet,
right.
the
creditor
and
the
trustee,
if
the
debtor
a
month
before
confirmation
gets
a
new
job
or
their
expenses
go
down
--
let's
say
you
had
a
car,
but
you
know
that
the
car
payments
are
going
to
be
done.
under
the
trustee's
view,
then
you
still
get
to
count
the
car
payments
which
are
totally
pretend,
or
if
you
got
a
much
higher
paying
job.
in
fact,
in
this
case
she
did
get
a
higher
paying
job.
towards
the
end
of
the
period,
she
got
a
raise.
and
we
say
that
has
to
be
counted,
too.
we
have
to
have
a
debtor
and
creditor-neutral
provision.
in
a
statute
that's
designed
to
make
sure
the
debtor
pays
a
much
as
possible
to
her
creditors,
it's
very
strange
to
put
this
entirely
in
the
debtor's
hands.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
contrast
between
1325
and
1329.
what
i
tried
to
do
in
my
brief,
and
i
have
laid
it
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument
section.
that's
where
we
try
to
articulate
our
rule.
what
we
have
done
is
we
have
looked
at
the
cases.
as
you
pointed
out,
this
is
pre-bapcpa
practice.
courts
have
set
a
pretty
high
bar,
both
in
terms
of
the
level
of
certainty
and
the
degree
of
deviation.
and
courts
have
said
--
i
will
give
you
an
example
that
will
illustrate
the
difference
perhaps.
you
have
times
when
someone
expects
to
get
a
raise.
they
don't
know
that
they
are
going
to
get
it,
or
they
expect
to
get
a
promotion.
and
courts
will
say,
even
if
that's
pretty
likely,
until
you
have
actually
got
it
we
are
not
going
to
count
it
for
purposes
of
1325(b);
come
back
under
1329.
and
we
point
out
in
our
merits
brief
that
in
fact,
it's
not
quite
on
point,
but
she
got
a
settlement
post-confirmation
here,
and
under
1329
that
money
was
applied.
so,
justice
scalia,
there
are
post-confirmation
events,
but
if
you
know
ahead
of
time
--
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example,
it
--
we
know
she
is
not
going
to
get
another
buyout
from
payless
shoe
stores.
when
it's
known
or
virtually
certain,
we
think
that
is
sufficient
--
akin
to
justice
sotomayor's
point
about,
you
know,
making
it
hard.
let
me
make
one
other
point.
i
wanted
to
finish
off
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice
about
101.
this
provision
has
taken
on
greater
significance
in
the
oral
argument
and
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner.
i
did
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
a
provision
that
is
not
reproduced
in
the
parties'
briefs,
but
if
the
court
were
to
go
this
route
it
would
want
to
be
aware
of,
and
that's
521(i).
and
521(i)
tells
us
that
you
do
have
to
file
the
forms
at
the
beginning
or
you
have
to
file
them
within
45
days,
but
upon
request
of
the
debtor
made
within
45
days
after
the
date
of
filing
the
petition,
the
court
may
allow
the
debtor
an
additional
period
of
not
to
exceed
45
days.
so
it
does
seem
to
constrain
the
power
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
shift
this
period
all
around.
so,
i
have
made
two
points.
one
is
it's
a
one-way
ratchet
for
the
debtor;
second,
it's
not
unlimited.
the
third
is
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
why
would
congress
design
a
system
that
would
have
all
of
these
machinations.
if
we
agree
that
congress
wants
--
it
seems
my
friend
and
i
agree
that
congress
believes
that
she
shouldn't
have
to
make
the
payments
that
would
be
required
under
the
trustee's
reading
of
"projected
disposable
income".
the
question
is
how
we
get
there.
the
trustee's
answer
is
that
you
are
required
by
the
text;
i'm
sorry,
congress
took
this
option
away.
and
i
think
that,
as
i
have
explained,
the
term
"projected
disposable
income
to
be
received
in
the
applicable
commitment
period.
"
really
is
not
language
that
you
would
ordinarily
construe
to
ignore
changes
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
that
is
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice,
why
i
started
with
the
definition
of
"current
monthly
income
in
the
6-month
period.
"
i
agree
that
it
is
an
important
point.
it
is
their
strongest
argument.
my
only
point
is
that
i
have
explained,
i
think,
why
congress
put
the
6-month
period
in
for
purposes
of
chapter
7
and
also
to
have
the
starting
point.
if
i
--
to
give
you
an
example,
take
inflation.
if
we
were
to
define
inflation
as
the
amount
in
the
rise
in
prices
over
the
previous
6
months,
if
congress
did
that
in
a
statute
and
then
told
us
to
look
at
projected
inflation,
we
would
still
not
ignore
things
that
will
tell
us
that
there
are
going
to
be
--
there
has
been
an
oil
price
spike
or
an
increase
in
health
care
costs.
it
would
take
a
pretty
firm,
firm
period
that
told
us
to
only
look
into
the
past
and
not
look
into
the
future,
particularly
when
the
whole
point
of
the
statute
is
to
make
sure
that
the
money
goes
into
the
creditor's
hands
that
the
debtor
is
able
to
pay.
on
the
point
of
discretion,
i
should
also
say
bapcpa
as
a
whole
was
intended
to
reduce
discretion.
and,
so,
it's
kind
of
odd
to
say
that
the
answer
to
our
position
is
to
turn
to
all
of
these
other
discretionary
provisions--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
--
i
--
i
would
use
the
language
that
congress
did
in
707.
remember,
the
current
monthly
income
reduced
by
the
amounts
determined
under
clauses
2,
3,
and
4
and
multiplied
by
60.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
multiply.
and
congress
did
that
a
bunch
of
times.
projected
--
if
we
try
to
project
something,
we
try
and
make
the
--
and
everybody
agrees
on
the
definition,
so
really,
it's
not
an
unusual
term.
it
is:
you
make
your
best
estimate
of
the
future
based
on
the
data
you
have
now.
my
friend
is
right.
one
piece
of
data
we
have
now
is
her
previous
6
months'
income.
another
piece
of
data
is
we
know
that
she's
not
going
to
have
the
same
income
in
the
future.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
