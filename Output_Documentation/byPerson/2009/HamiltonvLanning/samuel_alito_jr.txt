justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
before
the
2005
amendments,
bankruptcy
courts
were
recognized
as
having
discretion
in
calculating
projected
disposable
income
to
take
into
account
changes
in
the
debtor's
income
after
the
filing
of
the
plan,
and
shouldn't
we
presume
that
--
that
congress
intended
to
continue
essentially
the
same
regime,
unless
congress
provided
some
clear
indication
that
they
wanted
to
depart
from
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
is
odd
that
congress
provided
this
very
detailed
formula
and
--
and
that
they
would
provide
such
a
detailed
formula
and
then
say:
but
the
bankruptcy
court
can
modify
that
based
on
a
projection.
but
still
we
have
the
word
"projection
--
projected".
and
your
interpretation
leads
to
very
strange,
really
absurd
results;
isn't
that
true?
and
you
have
to
devise
some
really
elaborate
escape
strategies
in
order
to
allow
a
debtor
to
avoid
those
very
strange
results.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
say
that
that
can
be
done
only
if
the
debtor
fails
to
file
a
form
that
the
debtor
is
required
to
file;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
the
situation
in
which
the
change
that
is
projected
to
occur
and
in
fact
may
be
almost
certain
to
occur
is
one
that
causes
an
increase
in
the
debtor's
income?
let's
say
the
debtor
was
unemployed
through
almost
all
of
the
lookback
period
and
then
just
before
the
filing
of
the
plan
gets
a
job
with
a
good
salary.
you
would
say
that
the
--
if
you
just
look
at
the
lookback
period,
the
debtor
would
be
required
to
pay
practically
nothing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
a
creditor
to
do
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
can
the
--
can
the
plan
be
modified
based
on
--
can
the
plan
be
modified
based
on
something
that
was
known
before
the
plan
was
confirmed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
it
can't,
then
how
is
this
modification
remedy
going
to
work?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
argument
is
that
the
court
has
to
confirm
a
plan
that
is
really
not
confirmable
because
the
debtor
can't
possibly
make
the
payments
under
the
plan,
but
then
can
turn
around
immediately
and
modify
the
plan
so
that
it
does
call
for
payments
to
be
made.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
--
explain
it,
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
say
about
cases
in
which
moving
the
6-month
period
can't
solve
the
problem?
for
example,
if
the
debtor
had
good
income
for
many
years
going
back,
but
then
slight
--
shortly
before
the
filing
of
the
plan
loses
his
or
her
job,
and
there
is
no
prospect
that
the
debtor
is
going
to
get
another
job?
or
it
could
be
the
converse,
has
very
low
income
for
a
long
period
and
then
right
before
gets
a
job.
so
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
cure
those
problems
by
moving
the
6-month
period.
what
do
you
do
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this?
there
seems
to
be
at
least
a
subtle
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government's
position.
you
say
that
the
projected
disposable
income
will
be
different
from
the
disposable
income
calculated
during
the
lookback
period
when
it
is
known
or
virtually
certain
that
there
will
be
differences
in
income
or
expenses.
and
the
government
says
that
there
is
a
difference
when
something
is
likely
to
occur
in
the
future.
where
do
you
--
where
do
you
get
from
the
statute
your
known
or
virtually
certain
differences?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
think
bankruptcy
courts
are
supposed
to
be
economic
forecasters?
for
example,
if
you
--
after
calculating
the
debtor's
income
during
the
6-month
period,
the
6-month
lookback
period,
should
the
bankruptcy
court
said,
well
--
say:
well,
it's
--
inflation
is
projected
to
be
such-and-such
over
the
term
of
this
plan,
so
i
am
just
going
to
increase
it
by
the
amount
of
inflation;
or:
this
person
works
in
a
particular
industry
where
historically,
over
the
last
five
years
or
ten
years,
there's
been
a
3
percent
increase
in
salary
per
year,
so
i'm
going
to
multiply
it
by
--
multiply
the
disposable
income
figure
like
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
not?
you
say
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
should
take
into
account
things
that
are
likely
to
occur
in
the
future.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
debtor
is
a
waiter
and
during
the
last
month
of
the
6-month
period,
because
of
some
change
of
the
economy
the
waiter's
tips
have
gone
up
either
way
up
or
way
down?
what's
the
court
supposed
to
do
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
so
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
if
an
unsecured
creditor
or
a
bankruptcy
trustee
objects
to
the
confirmation
of
the
chapter
13
debtors
plan
for
the
repayment
of
deaths,
11
u.s.c.,
section
1325(b)(1)
requires
the
debtor
either
to
pay
unsecured
creditors
in
full
or
to
pay
all
“projected
disposable
income”
to
be
received
by
the
debtor
over
the
duration
of
plan.
we
hold
that
a
bankruptcy
court
may
calculate
projected
disposable
income
by
taking
into
account
foreseeable
changes
in
the
debtor's
income
or
expenses.
this
approach
is
consistent
with
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
undefined
word
projected
which
does
not
require
courts
to
assume
that
a
debtor's
past
income
and
expenses
will
necessarily
continue
unchanged
into
the
future.
it
is
also
consistent
with
congress'
use
of
the
word
projected
elsewhere
in
the
united
states
code
as
well
as
with
bankruptcy
practice
before
congress
enacted
the
bankruptcy
abuse
prevention
and
consumer
protection
act
of
2005,
which
did
not
eliminate
judicial
discretion
to
take
into
account
known
or
virtually
certain
changes
in
the
debtor's
income
or
expenses.
an
alternate
interpretation
of
projected
disposable
income
premised
upon
a
mechanical
extrapolation
of
the
debtor's
past
income
and
expenses
into
the
future
would
clash
with
certain
terms
of
section
1325
and
lead
to
anomalous
outcomes
in
which,
in
cases
in
which
a
debtor
experiences
unusually
high
or
unusually
low
income
during
the
period
immediately
preceding
the
filing
of
the
petition.
we
therefore
affirm.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
