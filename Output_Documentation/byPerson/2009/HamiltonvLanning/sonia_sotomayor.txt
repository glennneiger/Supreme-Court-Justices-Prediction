what
do
you
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
contention
that
the
court
is
bounded
by
other
requirements
such
as
the
timing
of
the
meeting
of
creditors
and
the
plan
confirmation,
that
that
binds
the
district
court
from
resetting
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
why
--
what
commends
going
through
all
these
machinations,
all
of
these
alternative
ways
of
avoiding
absurd
results?
isn't
the
answer
simply
that
we
just
narrow
the
circumstances
in
which
a
court
can
deviate
from
the
statutory
formula?
i
mean,
it's
not
--
even
before
this
change,
it
wasn't
that
the
district
courts
could
at
whim
change
the
projected
income.
they
have
to
have
a
clear
ground
to
do
so.
why
is
that
inadequate
to
protect
the
interests
that
congress
had
in
creating
this
new
formula
for
income
and
expenses?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
was
a
formula
before.
it
was
somewhat
ambiguous,
and
that's
what
led
to
the
more
defined
terms
for
income
and
expense.
but
that
says
nothing
about
changing
the
court's
power
to
act
in
a
situation
where
the
formula's
clearly
not
going
to
work.
that
was
the
standard
before.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
file
an
amended
plan
and
have
the
court
restart
the
clock,
when
101(10a)
says
only
if
the
debtor
has
not
filed
a
schedule
of
current
income?
if
there's
been
a
plan
confirmed
or
a
plan
proposed,
then
the
income
schedule
had
to
have
been
filed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
do
one
without
the
other.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
forget
about
1329.
i'm
going
to
the
situation
where
the
plan
has
been
proposed,
let's
say.
the
courts
--
if
a
schedule
of
income
has
been
filed,
then
it's
without
any
jurisdiction
to
change
the
6-month
lookback
period,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
can't
under
101(10a).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
his
words
were
"known
to
a
virtual
certainty",
which
are
--
likely
to
happen
is
different
than
likely
to
happen.
