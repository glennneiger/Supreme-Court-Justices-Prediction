chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
08-969,
hemi
group
v.
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
barnhouse.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
--
why
isn't
the
money
property?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
a
lawsuit
with
a
potential
recovery
regarded
as
property
of
an
individual?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
depend
upon
a
notion
that
the
causation
standard
as
--
in
rico
is
different
than
general
proximate
cause
standards
in
tort
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
that
proximate
cause
is
satisfied
only
with
respect
to
the
person
who
is
supposed
to
be
paying
the
taxes?
if
there's
some
way
in
which
someone
else
contributes
or
makes
it
feasible
or
makes
it
more
likely
that
the
person
is
not
going
to
pay
his
taxes,
that's
not
automatically
outside
the
scope
of
proximate
cause,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
koerner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
because
of
--
because
of
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
was
injured
by
the
consumer's
failure
--
it
was
injured
by
the
consumer's
failure
to
pay
the
taxes.
that
is
an
intervening
cause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
end
of
the
causation
chain?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
suing
him
for
setting
up
the
ambiance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
--
does
it
affect
your
ambiance
theory
that
the
website
has
the
language
that
your
friend
told
us
is
on
it,
that
you
have
to
--
you
know,
this
is
--
viability
varies
from
state
to
state
or
whatever
the
exact
language
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
still
creates
the
ambiance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
definition
and
giving
scope
and
meaning
to
the
concept
of
proximate
cause
is
one
that's
in
our
bailiwick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
because
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
or
at
least
in
many
of
them,
we
kind
of
wring
our
hands
and
say,
well,
we
don't
have
any
choice,
this
is
what
congress
did,
and
we're
faithful
to
that
intent.
but
i
guess,
as
i
tried
to
point
out
earlier,
this
is
a
different
question.
this
is
the
usual
judicial
application
of
concepts
of
proximate
cause,
and
i
would
have
thought
concern
about
how
broad
rico
was
written
and
how
broadly
it
has
been
interpreted
would
cause
us
to
look
very
carefully
to
the
proximate
cause
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
--
i
don't
understand
that.
the
injury
is
directly
caused
by
the
consumers
who
don't
pay
the
taxes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
a
mail
order
house
and
they
put
a
little
line
on
it,
says:
by
the
way,
if
you
live
out
of
state,
no
taxes,
no
sales
taxes.
then
they're
also
subject
to
rico
prosecution?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
whom
was
the
affirmative
misrepresentation
made?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
want
silence
to
be
interpreted
as
acquiescence,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
get
back
at
maybe
the
same
point
justice
kennedy
was
raising,
which
is
you're
focusing
on
--
you
keep
saying:
the
whole
purpose
of
this,
look
at
their
website.
but
the
issue
is
proximate
cause,
and
if
you've
got
to
go
through
the
individual
consumer,
it's
either
proximate
cause
or
not.
and
if
the
--
if
the
indirect
nature
of
what
they're
doing
because
the
direct
cause
is
the
consumer's
failure
to
pay,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
their
intent
is
pertinent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
barnhouse,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
it
--
well,
i
don't
know,
maybe
it's
more
--
but
isn't
it
a
proposition
that
you
don't
rely
on
illegal
conduct,
that
the
--
the
assumption
of
illegal
conduct
cuts
the
chain?
in
other
words,
there's
only
proximate
cause
if
you
assume
people
are
going
to
not
pay
taxes
that
they're
due,
contrary
to
law,
and
that
that
breaks
the
proximate
cause
chain?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that
you
have
to
--
in
order
to
maintain
--
this
is
a
helpful
question.
in
order--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
order
to
maintain
the
chain
of
connection,
i
thought
you
cannot
rely,
for
one
of
those
links
in
the
chain,
that
a
party
is
going
to
commit
illegal
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
a
good
place
to
end.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
an
opinion
this
morning
in
case
number
08-969,
hemi
group
versus
the
city
of
new
york.
the
city
of
new
york
taxes
the
possession
of
cigarettes.
if
you
sell
cigarettes
in
new
york
city
you
have
to
charge,
collect
and
remit
the
tax
to
the
city.
hemi
group,
however,
is
based
in
new
mexico
and
it
sells
cigarettes
online
to
residents
of
the
city.
neither
state
nor
city
law
requires
hemi
to
charge,
collect
or
remit
the
tax
and
the
purchasers
seldom
pay
it
on
their
own,
but
a
federal
law
called
the
jenkins
act
requires
out-of-state
vendors
like
hemi
to
turnover
customer
information
to
the
states
where
they
ship
the
cigarettes.
when
new
york
state
gets
this
customer
information
from
hemi,
it
can
pass
it
on
to
the
city.
when
the
city
has
the
customer
information,
it
can
pursue
payment
from
customers
who
do
not
pay
the
tax
on
their
own.
in
this
case
the
city
alleges
that
hemi
he
did
not
turn
over
the
jenkins
act
information
to
the
state.
without
that
information
the
city
could
not
recover
cigarette
taxes.
the
city
sued
hemi,
alleging
that
hemi's
actions
amounted
to
a
violation
of
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
known
as
rico.
now,
to
recover
under
rico,
the
city
must
show
that
it
lost
the
tax
revenue
by
reason
of"
hemi's
failure
to
file
jenkins
acts
reports
with
the
state.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
sits
in
new
york
city
held
that
the
city
met
that
requirement.
we
disagree.
to
establish
that
it
suffered
an
injury
by
reason
of
the
alleged
rico
violation,
the
city
must
show
that
the
alleged
fraud,
the
failure
to
file
the
jenkins
act
reports
with
the
state
not
only
was
a
cause
of
the
injury
but
that
it
was
the
proximate
cause.
proximate
cause
is
a
legal
concept
that
captures
the
same
notion
as
the
old
proverb
for
want
of
a
nail,
you
know
how
it
goes,
for
want
of
a
nail
the
shoe
was
lost,
for
one
of
the
shoe
the
horse
was
lost
and
so
on
to
the
loss
of
the
kingdom.
the
concept
of
proximate
cause
in
the
law
means
that
forgetting
the
nail
doesn't
make
you
liable
for
the
loss
of
the
kingdom.
as
justice
oliver
wendell
holmes
put
it
nearly
a
century
ago,
the
general
tendency
of
the
law
in
regard
to
damages
at
least
is
not
to
go
beyond
the
first
step.
now
in
the
rico
context,
we
have
made
clear
that
proximate
cause
focuses
on
whether
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
the
injury
asserted
and
the
harmful
conduct.
the
city's
causal
theory
here
cannot
satisfy
rico's
direct
relationship
requirement.
according
to
the
city,
hemi
committed
fraud
by
selling
cigarettes
to
city
residents
and
failing
to
submit
the
required
customer
information
to
the
state.
without
the
reports
from
hemi
the
state
could
not
pass
on
the
information
to
the
city.
some
of
the
customers
legally
obligated
to
pay
their
taxes
failed
to
do
so,
because
the
city
did
not
have
the,
did
not
receive
the
customer
information
it
could
not
determine
which
customers
had
failed
to
pay
the
tax.
the
city
thus
could
not
pursue
those
customers
for
payment
and
the
city
was
thereby
injured
in
the
amount
of
the
portion
of
back
taxes
that
were
never
collected.
because
the
city's
theory
of
causation
requires
us
to
move
well
beyond
the
first
step,
that
theory
cannot
meet
rico's
direct
relationship
requirement.
the
city's
theory
requires
that
we
extend
rico
liability
to
situations
where
the
defendants
fraud
on
a
third-party,
the
state
here,
has
made
it
easier
for
a
fourth
party,
the
taxpayer
to
cause
harm
to
the
plaintiff,
the
city.
put
simply,
hemi's
obligation
was
to
file
the
jenkins
act
reports
with
the
state,
not
the
city
and
the
city's
harm
was
directly
caused
by
the
customers
not
by
hemi.
we
have
never
before
stretched
the
causal
chain
of
the
rico
violations
so
far
and
we
would
decline
to
do
so
today.
now
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
bears
remembering
what
this
case
is
about.
it
is
about
the
rico
liability
of
a
company
for
lost
taxes
it
had
no
obligation
to
collect,
remit
or
pay,
which
harmed
a
party
to
whom
it
owed
no
duty.
it
is
about
imposing
such
liability
to
substitute
or
complement
the
governing
body's
uncertain
ability
or
desire
to
collect
taxes
directly
from
those
who
owe
them
and
it
is
about
the
fact
that
liability
under
rico
comes
with
treble
damages
and
attorney's
fees
attached.
now
this
court
has
interpreted
rico
broadly
consistent
with
its
terms,
but
we
have
also
held
that
its
reach
is
limited
by
the
requirement
of
a
direct
causal
connection
between
the
predicate
harm
and
the
wrong.
the
city's
injuries
here
were
not
caused
directly
by
the
alleged
fraud
and
thus
were
not
caused
by
reason
of"
it.
the
city
therefore
has
no
rico
claim.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justices
scalia,
thomas
and
alito
join
this
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
kennedy
have
joined.
justice
satomoyor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
now
in
case
number
07-11191,
briscoe
versus
virginia
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning
a
brief
per
curiam
opinion.
it
is
so
brief
that
i
will
read
the
entire
thing.
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
in
melendez
diaz
versus
massachusetts.
