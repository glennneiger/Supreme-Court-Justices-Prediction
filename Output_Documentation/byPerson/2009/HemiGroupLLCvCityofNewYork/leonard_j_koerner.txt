mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
property,
this
goes
back
to
wyoming
v.
oklahoma,
where
in
an
original
jurisdiction
case
wyoming
sued
the
state
of
oklahoma
on
the
ground
that
the
state's
regulation
which
attempted
to
require
oklahoma
coal-fired
generation
plants
to
use
10
percent
of
oklahoma
coal,
and
prior
to
the
legislation
all
of
wyoming
coal
was
used
in
the
generation
plant.
wyoming
sued
in
this
court
and
the
defense
was
that
wyoming
didn't
have
an
interest
because
it
lost
the
opportunity
to
collect
taxes.
this
court
found
standing
and
allowed
them
to
sue
and
successfully
challenge
under
the
interstate
commerce
rule.
that
was
before
we
get
to
pasquantino.
justice
ginsburg
is
quite
right--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
--
it
was
just
--
i
was
just
going
to
--
yes,
it
was
just
a
discussion
of
what
was
the
nature
of
wyoming's
interest.
was
it
substantial
enough
to
allow
them
to
sue,
challenging
the
oklahoma
statute.
in
pasquantino,
though,
the
issue
was
foreclosed.
in
that
particular
case
the
issue
of
definition
of
property
was
the
exact
same
issue
that
you
have
in
the
rico
case.
indeed,
mail
and
wire
fraud
is
a
predicate
for
rico.
in
that
case
there
was,
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
a
criminal
prosecution
based
on
the
importation
of
alcohol
into
canada
from
maryland.
the
charge
was
wire
fraud.
and
first,
there
were
two
issues:
one,
the
revenue
rule,
which
is
not
relevant
here.
but
the
first
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
opportunity
to
collect
taxes
which
canada
lost,
whether
that
was
an
injury
to
property.
and
there
was
a
long
discussion
by
this
court
equating
the
lost
opportunity
with
embezzlement
from
the
canadian
treasury
and
pointing
out
in
the
definition
of
black's
and
the
webster's
definition
that
property
includes
not
only
that
which
you
actually
have,
but
that
which
you
were
denied
the
opportunity.
in
this
particular
case,
the
reason
we
don't
have
the
taxes
is
because
of
the
act
of
fraud
as
we
allege
of
the
defendant.
it's
a
little
tough--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--the
fraud
of
the
defendant.
it's
a
little
hard
to
argue
when
you've
created
the
situation
so
we
can't
collect
that
an
inability
to
collect
then
becomes
no
property.
after
pasquantino
this
court
decided
the
anza
case,
which
i'll
discuss
for
both
issues.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
as
long
as
they
meet
the
definition
of--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--if
people--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--why
would--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--this
is
precisely
what
happened
in
anza.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
if
you're--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
they're
suggesting--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
they're
suggesting
a
stopping
place
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
actual
language
of
the
rico--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--well,
may
i--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--if
there
is
a
systematic
understatement
under
the
statute,
that's
exactly--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--it
says--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
and
in
these--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--and
indeed
that
--
that
is
what
congress
intended.
if
you
look--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--well,
in
fact
what
they
put
in
in
1978
was
the
contraband
cigarette
trafficking--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
the
reason
they
put
it
in
was
to
increase
the
criminal
penalties
as
well
as
recognize
the
civil
penalties.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
importation
--
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--well,
the
issue
hasn't
been
raised.
but
the
--
but
the
--
rico
has
been
consistently
interpreted
by
this
court
in
an
expansionist
mode,
and
despite
that
congress
has
not
truncated
it
except
in
the
one
area
of
securities
violation
and
only
because
they
found
that
there
were
ample
remedies
in
securities
law,
and
because
they
thought
it
was
inappropriate
to
use
exclusively
mail
and
wire
fraud.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
they
had
a
more
general
definition,
and
they
wanted
the
broadest
possible
interpretation.
but
the
cigarette
contraband
trafficking
act
was
put
into
rico
as
a
predicate
crime.
the
sole
economic
injury
in
that
act
is
lost
taxes
to
the
state
and
the
city.
it's
the
only
economic
injury.
it's
hard
to
say
that
congress
didn't
contemplate
this
when,
in
addition
to
the
general
definition,
they
put
this
in.
in
addition,
the
jenkins
act
was
passed
in
1949
precisely
for
this
problem,
so
it
was
on
congressional
minds.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
what
we're
saying
is
the
jenkins
act
is
some
evidence
of
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant
when
he
commits
this
fraud.
what
we
are
saying
is
he
is
aware
that
he
has
an
obligation
to
file
reports
with
the
state
indicating
both
the
identity
of
the
seller
and
the
identity
of
the
purchaser.
our
predicate
act
is
not
jenkins.
our
predicate
act
is
wire
and
mail
fraud.
even
if
jenkins
did
not
exist,
we
would
still
have
a
wire
and
mail
fraud
cause
of
action
based
on
the
representations
of
the
seller,
which
is
that
all
the
sales
are
tax-free.
what
jenkins
does
through
the
cooperation
agreement
is
it
gives
us
the
mechanism
to
collect
these
taxes
when
they're
complied
with.
if
the
defendant
by
active
intervention
does
not
file
and
instead
advertises
no
sales
tax
required,
he
is
preventing
us
from--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no.
we
have
--
we
have
alleged
that
he
has
not
--
not
filed
one
report
with
new
york
state.
indeed,
he
has
actively
represented
in
the
website
that
he
has
no
obligation
to
file
the
report,
and
that
any
information
that
he
obtains
from
the
purchaser
is
confidential.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but
in
the
antitrust
case
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
the
reason
there
that
the
state
was
not
allowed
to
sue
was
not
because
of
the
injury.
it
was
not
--
it
was
the
directness
of
the
injury.
this
court
pointed
out
the
fact
that
there
was
the
possibility
of
duplicative
recoveries,
and
the
state
of
hawaii
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
consumers.
here,
we
have
a
direct
injury.
the
city
was
the
only
one
injured
as
a--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
because
it's
--
while
the
consumer
has
failed,
we
are
suing
the
seller
because
he
set
up
the
ambiance,
the
environment
for
the
consumer
not
to
pay.
it
is
his--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--yes.
he
is
the
one
who
created
the
fraud,
by
leading
the
consumer
to
believe
they
didn't
have
an
obligation
to
pay.
we
are
suing
based
on
impedence
with
the
opportunity
to
collect
taxes,
where
there
are
three
parties
to
this
transaction--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
and
that's
something
we
could
establish
at
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
absolutely,
because
the
response
rate
of
individuals
on
their
own
when
the
jenkins
report
is
not
filed
is
extremely
low.
yet
when
the
jenkins
report
is
filed
they
do--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
know
with
respect
to--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--probably
very
low.
but
in
this
particular--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
we
do
have
a
cooperation
agreement.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
if
you
look
in
footnote
8
of
our
brief,
we
point
out,
even
in
this
case,
when
we've
settled
with
parties
and
they've
turned
over
the
information
we
have
been
able
to
recover
significant
amounts
of
the
taxes
owed.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
when
you
look
at
the
website
and
you
have
flashing
lights
that
say
"no
taxes
required",
indeed
we
allege
in
the
complaint
that
the
entire
business
model
is
predicated
on
the
fact
that
they
don't
have
to
pay
state
and
city
taxes.
the
wide
difference
allows
for
the
profit
for
the
seller
and
a
savings
for
the
buyer.
that
is
what
we
allege
and,
given
the
opportunity,
we
can
prove
that.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
easier
to
prove,
but
i
can't
dispute
justice
breyer's
fact
pattern,
that
if
you
had
an
underpayment
through
a
fraudulent
return
that
it
may
be
a
predicate
for
rico,
and
indeed--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--yes.
that
would
be
a
better
factor--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--well,
i
do
want
to
reiterate
the
fact
that,
apart
from
the
general
language
in
this
case,
we
do
have
this
contraband
cigarette
trafficking
act,
which
i
alluded
to
earlier.
that
--
that
act
precisely
deals
with
the
problem
of
underpayment
of
taxes
for
cigarettes.
it
was
passed
in
1978
and
then
amended
in
2006
to
include
localities.
it
has
very
severe
penalties
under
rico
criminally.
it
allows
for
fines
and
forfeitures.
but
more
important,
you
can
use
rico
civilly,
and
the
only
economic
injury
in
that
entire
legislation
is
the
lost
opportunity
to
collect
taxes.
so
it's
difficult
to
say
that
congress
was
not
aware
of
this
problem,
aware
of
its
potential
scope.
and
while
i
understand
this
court's
frustration,
it
seems
to
me,
as
this
court
has
said
in
many
cases,
including
the
last
one,
boyle,
it
resides
with
congress
to
change
it.
if
they
feel
there
is
a
misuse
of
this
legislation
and
suits
are
exploding
out
of
context
in
terms
of
what
they
contemplated,
then
they
should
change
it.
yet--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--it
is,
but
if
you
look
at
--
chief
judge,
if
you
look
at
how
you've
applied
proximate
cause
in
the
past
in
anza,
in
holmes,
what
you
said
is
that
there
are
other
factors
that
are
not
associated
with
the
unlawful
act,
and
therefore
you
didn't
want
courts
or
juries
to
have
to
parse
--
parse
out
legitimate
business
problems
and
illegitimate
business
problems
because
they
become
too
complex.
you
don't
have
that
here.
here,
you
have
direct
injury
to
the
city,
and
it's
an
easy
calculation.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
in
the
particular
cases
that
we
mentioned
in
footnote
8,
they
were
parts
of
settlements
for
the
people
who
had,
similar
to
this
particular
defendant,
had
advertised
as
tax-free,
and
we
had
settled
with
those
people
to
get
the
reports,
and
then,
based
on
the
reports,
we
were
able
to
track
them
down.
where
we
get
the
jenkins
--
where
people
voluntarily
disclose
the
jenkins
act
reports,
we
do
follow
up
aggressively,
but
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
not
yet,
no.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but
that
--
but--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--here's
what
would
be
worth
it:
if
we
can
stop
the
fraudulent
practices
that
these
sellers
represent
through
the
treble
damages.
the
only
benefit
that
these
internet
sellers
have
is
the
cost
saving
as
a
consequence
of
the
tax
saving.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
i
would
like
to
think
that
those
out-of-state
sales
entities
don't
exist
solely
to
try
to
deprive
receiving
states
of
tax.
the
difference
here
is
the
entire
business
plan
is
based
on
not
paying
tax.
now,
rico
has
been
in
business
since
1970.
your
decisions
have
expanded
its
use.
as
i
indicated,
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
restrict
it
in
any
way,
and,
indeed,
despite--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
in
the
proximate
cause
equation,
as
you
yourself
have
defined
it,
meaning
the
court,
you've
talked
about
unlawful
issues
and
lawful
issues.
and
as
i
indicated,
where
there's
a
combination
you
don't
want
a
court
to
weigh
what's
lawful
and
unlawful.
but
here
our
injury
--
injury
is
solely
the
result
of
an
unlawful
use.
there
are
no
intervening
factors.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
and
i
--
that's
--
that's
the
way
you
frame
it,
i
understand,
but
it
can
be
equally
framed
by
saying
the
injury
is
caused
by
the
seller's
misrepresentation,
which
encourages
the
purchasers
not
to
pay
taxes.
and
if
you
look
at
the
websites,
there
is
no
doubt
about
what
this--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no.
i'm
saying--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--i
know.
what
i
am
saying
is
that,
given
the
opportunity
to
prove
this,
we
can
show
that
the
entire
business
model
was
intended
never
to
have
any
taxes
paid
on
these
transactions.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
there
are
no
other
intervening
causes
between
the
fraud
and
the
injury
to
the
city.
it
is
--
we
lost
an
opportunity.
look--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--because
in
this
case,
they
don't
have
any
other
reason--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--the
law
of
proximate
cause
in
the
case
you
described,
you
would
have
to
consider
all
of
the
issues,
some
related
to
the
transaction
that
you're
suing
on,
some
not.
if
the
mail
order
catalog
could
show
there
were
other
reasons
for
their
sales,
not
attributable
to
the
unlawful
rico
definition,
then
it's
the
type
of
injury
you
don't
want
to
make
an
inquiry
to.
but
if
you
have--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--except
that
the
buyer
--
the
seller
is
advertising
it
as
tax-free.
he's
not--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--as
i
said,
it's
a
harder
case
because
there
may
be
other
reasons
why
that
mail
order
house
is
--
is
successful,
just
like
you
said
in
anza,
just
like
you
said
in
holmes.
but
in
this
case
there's
only
--
it's
the
whole
model.
there's
only
one
reason
why
they're
successful.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
except
that
the
seller
--
that's
not
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
seller
affirmatively
represented
that
there
are
no
taxes.
he
told
the
consumer,
and
then
kept
the
consumer's
identity
unknown--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--by
deliberately
not
filing
as
required
by
federal
statute,
and
places
us
in
a
--
in
the
position
in
the
circle
of
having
no
knowledge
of
who
the
buyer
is,
having
affirmative
misrepresentation,
and
we
are
the
only
one
in
this
transaction
who
are
directly
injured.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
customers.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
because
of
the
representation
that--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--they
would
never
contact
the
state
with
any
information
concerning
the
transaction.
that's
exactly
what
they
did.
everybody
understands
in
the
nature
of
these
purchasing
exactly
what
it's
about.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
what
i'm
telling
you,
that
it's
probably
easier
to
go
to
the
corner
store
and
obtain
a
package
of
cigarettes
than
order
it
over
the
internet.
what
i'm
saying,
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
of
the
facts.
the
facts
were
affirmative
misstatements
by
the
seller.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
i
think
it's
a
question
of
proof,
and
if
we're
able
to
show
that
these
individuals
thought
it
was
tax-free,
then
we
should
be
able
to
pursue
--
let
me
just
say,
forget
the
jenkins
act.
you
have
the
cigarette
trafficking
act.
that
is
within
rico.
that
sole
economic
injury
is
loss
of
revenue
to
the
state
and
the
city.
so
if
we
allege
the
cigarette
trafficking
act
--
it
was
not
applicable
at
the
time
of
this
case;
it
was
amended
to
apply
to
localities
slightly
after,
but
if
we
predicated
the
case
on
that,
would
you
still
say
there's
a
proximate
cause
issue
when
you
have
congress's
express
intent
to
allow
that
to
be
a
predicate
to
the
rico
count?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
no,
no.
it
was
rhetorical.
i
wasn't--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--i'm
just
trying
to--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
we're
seeking
--
the
injury
is
the
opportunity
to
collect,
which
we've
been
denied,
which
is
the
cigarette
traffic
act
contemplates.
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
that
act,
the
sole
purpose
was
to
make
it
a
very,
very
serious
felony,
and
with
civil
undertones,
in
order
to
discourage
the
act
as
a
disincentive,
so
that
this
trafficking,
which
is
a
major
problem,
started
to
be
reduced.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but
if
the
shipment
is
done
with
the
intent
of
avoiding
taxes,
which
was
contemplated
by
this
statute--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
correct.
there's
a
question
of
proof.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it
was
directly--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--may
i
address
the
rest
of
you?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
in
those
cases,
you
have
established
companies
and
you
may
have
to
look
behind
to
see
what
is
the
reason;
why
are
they
at
--
i
assume
they
have
other
businesses
that
are
legitimate.
this
particular
enterprise
has
no
legitimate
aspect.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
first
of
all,
in
time,
the
internet
has
raised
many
issues.
it's
unclear
how
congress
feels
about
this.
we
have
legitimate
enterprise.
but
cigarettes
have
been
a
particular
focus,
and
i
think,
in
effect,
you
cannot
use
the
general
argument
as
to
the
internet,
when
you
have
congressional
legislation
which,
one,
under
the
jenkins
act,
was
specifically
passed
in
1949
because
of
transactions
like
this,
where
states
were
--
were
being
deprived
of
the
revenues
through
the
interstate
shipments.
and
you
have
the
traffic
--
the
cigarette
trafficking
act
which
is,
again,
an
expression
by
congress
that
they
want
these
individuals
to
be
put
out
of
business.
that's
exactly
what
rico
is
about.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
state
has
records,
but
they
--
they've
been
uninterested
in
this
issue
for
political
reasons.
