justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
such
adjective
--
i
know
we
have
used
it,
but
there
is
no
such
adjective
as
"choate".
there
is
"inchoate",
but
the
opposite
of
"inchoate"
is
not
"choate".
justice
antonin
scalia
any
more
than
the
--
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
yes.
it's
like
"gruntled".
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
"disgruntled"
and
the
opposite
of
"disgruntled"
is
"gruntled".
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
this
different?
i
mean,
it's
clear
that
"property"
can
mean
that.
you
acknowledge
that
it
can
mean
the
government's
entitlement
to
money
from
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
can
mean
that.
now
why
--
why
should
we
say
it
doesn't
mean
that
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
word
"property"
used
in
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
--
and
it's
clear
that
for
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws,
property
does
not
include
the
government's
entitlement
to
income
from
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
--
that's
something
different.
this
isn't
just
the
general,
you
know,
you
hurt
the
economy
and
therefore
you
hurt
the
state.
here,
what
they're
saying
is:
you
caused
people
who
owed
me
taxes
not
to
pay
taxes,
an
identified
sum
of
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
might
have
been
inchoate
but
still
--
they
would
have
to
be
prove
that,
i
assume,
in
the
litigation
here,
wouldn't
they?
i
mean,
let's
assume
we
let
the
litigation
go
forward.
wouldn't
they
have
to
prove
what
taxes
were
not
paid?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
worry
about
that
later.
i
mean,
just
because
some
of
them
might
be
difficult
to
prove
or
not
provable
doesn't
mean
that
the
rest
that
are
very
clear
do
not
constitute
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
talk
about
that
one,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
got
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
it,
a
user
tax
once
it
gets
into
the
city?
justice
antonin
scalia
like
automobiles.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
like
automobiles.
if
you
buy
a
car
out
of
the
state,
you
haven't
paid
the
state
sales
tax,
but
if
you
bring
it
into
the
state,
you
have
to
pay
a
use
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
all
it
was
alleged
that
these
websites
said,
"tax-free"?
they
said
"tax-free"?
justice
antonin
scalia
"sales
are
tax-free".
that's
very
clever.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
--
"no
tobacco
tax"?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
a
tobacco
tax,
isn't
there?
don't
you
--
wouldn't
you
call
that
use
tax
a
tax
on
tobacco?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
sanctions
for
failing
to
comply
with
the
jenkins
act,
just
on
its
own,
without
having
to
go
through
rico?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
some
exemption,
anyway,
for
a
couple
of
cartons?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
what,
two
cartons?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
probably
cost
them
more
to
collect
than
--
than
it's
worth
the
money,
don't
you
think,
to
sue
individual
citizens
after
they
get
the
names?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
did
--
was
there
some
statute
at
issue
in
that
case
which
required
not
just
an
interest,
but
an
interest
in
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
should
that
help?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
can
you
call
it
--
i
mean,
part
of
the
problem
with
calling
it
property
is
there
--
there
is
such
a
low
chance
of
recovery
of
the
amount
owed
here.
even
if
the
jenkins
act
filing
had
been
made,
you
still
have
to
--
have
to
assume
that
this
--
number
one,
you
have
to
assume
that
the
state
would
turn
the
list
over
to
the
city,
which
the
state
isn't
required
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
state
isn't
required
to,
and
the
state
can
terminate
that
agreement
whenever
it
likes.
but,
secondly,
after
you
get
the
information
we
have
to
assume
that
you're
going
to
move
against
these
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
follow
up
by
writing
them
a
letter
and
what
your
footnote
8
says
is,
when
you
wrote
them
a
letter,
about
half
of
them
coughed
--
coughed
up
the
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
have
been
the
foolish
half.
did--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
were
the
other
--
were
the
other
half
pursued
by
the
city?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
yet.
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
can't
be
worth
it.
it
can't
possibly
be
worth
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
reason
on
whose
part?
some
reason
on
whose
part?
on
the
seller's
part
or
on
the
new
york
buyers'
part?
they
will
be
--
the
new
york
buyer
is
doing
it
because
it's
cheaper
because
he
is
not
going
to
pay
taxes
on
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
seller
couldn't
care
less
whether
the
buyer
pays
taxes
on
it
or
not.
so
long
as
he
pays
the
money
for
the
cigarettes,
the
seller
has
gotten
what
the
seller
wanted.
justice
antonin
scalia
usually
you're
not
liable
for
misrepresentation
unless
it
causes
--
it's
relied
on.
you
really
think
that
the
--
that
a
large
percentage
of
the
people
who
were
getting
this
stuff
really,
really
were
gulled
into
believing
that
new
york
state
was
somehow
being
done
out
of
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
am
sure
the
purchaser
knows:
i'm
not
going
to
pay
taxes,
even
though
i
should
pay
taxes.
but
you're
--
you're
telling
me
that
the
only
reason
the
purchaser
doesn't
pay
taxes
is
because
of
this
misrepresentation
that
you
don't
have
to
purchase
--
you
don't
have
to
pay
taxes.
i've
known
a
lot
of
new
yorkers,
and
not
many
of
them
are
that
gullible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure.
let's
talk
about
the
contraband
cigarette
trafficking.
i'm
not
sure
that
these
people
would
be
in
violation
of
it.
it
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
knowingly
to
ship
or
transport,
also
receive,
possess,
sell,
distribute,
or
purchase,
cigarettes
which
bear
no
evidence
of
payment
of
applicable
state
or
local
cigarette
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
no
applicable
state
or
local
cigarette
tax
upon
the
shipment
of
these
cigarettes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
makes
it
unlawful
to
knowingly
ship
it
when
they
bear
no
evidence
of
payment
of
applicable
taxes,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
is
no
applicable
taxes
at
the
time
that
they
ship
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
look
at
legislative
history.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
get
half-treble
damages.
what
is
that?
one-and-a-half
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
--
no,
no,
your
response
is,
but
for,
plus
foreseeable,
is
not
a
definition
of
proximate
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
need
more
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
wrong.
i
mean,
at
least
for
civil
torts,
you
can
--
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
where
the
landlord
leaves
out
the
bulb
in
the
--
in
the
stairway
and
one
of
the
residents
gets
mugged
and
he
sues
the
landlord
and
wins,
even
though
there
is
an
intervening
criminal
act.
now,
maybe
what
you
want
to
argue
is
that
that
--
that
has
never
been
applied,
to
my
knowledge,
to
either
criminal
liability
or
--
or
penal
provisions,
and
that
maybe
the
--
an
intervening
criminal
act
does
cut
off
causality,
for
purposes
of
penal
statute,
such
as
--
such
as
rico.
that
would
be
a
reasonable
argument.
