justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
status
of
taxes
owing
for
wire
fraud
purposes
was
settled
in
pasquantino.
there
it
was
a
question
of
alcohol
taxes
owed
to
canada.
there
were
taxes
due,
but
not
paid.
so
why
doesn't
pasquantino
settle
at
least
the
property
question
that
taxes
owed
to
a
sovereign
qualify
as
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
are
certainly
differences
from
this
case,
and
it
wasn't
a
rico
case,
either.
but
why
would
the
determination
of
what
--
whether
an
amount
owed
to
a
government
qualifies
as
property,
why
wouldn't
--
why
would
that
answer
differ?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
assessment
by
canada
in
the
pasquantino
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
said
the
--
the
defendant
was
smuggling
liquor
into
canada
and
getting
it
there
without
paying
the
canadians'
exorbitant
taxes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
talking
about
--
only
about
property,
not
standing
or
anything
else.
and
in
pasquantino,
the
court
said
that
a
scheme
aimed
--
aimed
at
depriving
canada
of
money
to
which
it
was
entitled
by
law
qualifies
as
property
for
wire
fraud
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
injured
because
it
couldn't
find
its
citizens
because
it
didn't
know
who
they
were.
and
that
was
the
whole
idea
of
the
jenkins
act,
was
to
help
states
find
the
people
who
were
evading
the
payment
of
the
use
tax
on
the
cigarettes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
go
back
to
the
question
i
had
asked
you
and
was
not
finished
getting
your
position
on.
jenkins
requires
report
to
the
state.
you
say
the
city
was
not
within
the
zone
of
interest.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
sellers,
the
out-of-state
sellers
of
cigarettes,
my
goodness,
would
they
really
want
not
only
to
have
the
burden
of
sending
a
list
of
names
to
the
state,
but
to
every
county
and
municipality?
isn't
it
the
--
just
as
it
is
in
new
york,
there
is
a
working
relationship.
the
state
gets
all
the
names,
and
then
it
sends
the
names
to
the
cities.
you
--
you
--
i
--
you're
suggesting
that
it
would
be
okay
if
the
jenkins
act
had
made
it
even
more
burdensome
to
the
cigarette
sellers
by
saying
not
only
do
you
have
to
disclose
to
the
state
but
also
to
any
municipality
that
independently
taxes
cigarettes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
--
we're
told
that
new
york
city
and
new
york
state
have
a
tax
informationsharing
agreement
pursuant
to
which
the
state
does
share
this
information
with
the
city.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
people
who
buy
cigarettes
out
of
state
come
back
to
their
home
state
and
voluntarily
pay
the
use
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
needs
the
names
so
it
can
collect
anything.
otherwise,
how
is
it
--
how
--
how
would
it
ever
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
if
these
jenkins
act
lists
--
are
they
in
fact
maintained
by
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
congress
said
--
we
were
just
told
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
congress
said
you
can
only
--
only
the
federal
prosecutor
can
sue
for
violations
of
jenkins--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
new
york
city,
not
new
york
state--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
it's
a
misdemeanor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
now
you
--
you
are
saying
the
jenkins
act
gives
you
a
basis
to
go
after
what
are
basically
aiders
and
abettors
of
use
tax
violations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you
know
--
do
we
know
that?
do
we
know
whether
the
petitioner
has
in
fact
filed
the
jenkins
act
report
with
new
york
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
--
you
gave
an
instance
in
your
brief
or
two
instances
of
successful
attempts
to
recoup
from
the
taxpayer,
that
is
the
cigarette
buyer.
did
those
come
about
because
the
city
received
the
jenkins
act
list
from
the
state?
how
did
the
city
get--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
is
what
they're
doing
any
different
from
what
out-of-state
mail
order
houses
have
done
in
--
they
set
--
they
set
up
in
states
without
a
sales
tax,
they
ship
into
a
state
that
has
a
compensating
use
tax,
that,
apart
from
automobiles,
i
don't
know
is
ever
collected.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
winter
in
the
second
circuit
said
the
state
appears
uninterested
in
enforcing
the
jenkins
act
and
may
not
collate
or
maintain
accurate
records
of
reports
from
out-of-state
vendors.
what
--
what
was
the
basis
for
his
statement
that
the
state
appears
uninterested?
