the

right,

but
none
of
them
involved
a
claim
to
taxes.
justice

well,
maybe
that
isn't
completely
true.
maybe
it's
a
matter
of
convenience,
at
least
theoretically.
you
buy
stuff
over
the
internet,
you
buy
these
advertised
cigarettes,
the
price
seems
all
right,
and
you
don't
--
whether
you
pay
the
tax
or
not
is
your
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
were--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
what
if
the
seller
didn't
make
those
misstatements
but
just
says
--
the
whole
operation
is
set
up
exactly
as
this
one
is,
but
they
don't
have
that
statement
in
there;
they
just
say:
get
advice
from
your
lawyer
about
whether
you
need
to
pay
taxes
or
not.
and
what
if
that
was
the
--
that
was
exactly
the
--
and
then
they
all
got
the
advice,
and
the
lawyer
says:
they'll
never
catch
you
if
you
don't
pay
it.
