mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
possessory
and
use
taxes
are
extremely
difficult
to
collect,
even
under
the
best
of
circumstances.
indeed,
here
the
city
alleges
in
its
second
amended
complaint
that
it
only
collected
40
cents
on
the
dollar,
and
its
response
claims
a
collection
rate
of
55
cents
on
the
dollar.
yet
it
wants
to
collect
300
cents
on
the
dollar
from
my
clients,
who
never
owed
these
taxes
in
the
first
place.
the
respondent
city
of
new
york
alleged
two
rico
claims
and
pendent
state
law
violations
that
the
city
said
resulted
in
a
lost
sovereign
opportunity
to
collect
cigarette
possessory
taxes
from
its
city
residents.
the
alleged
lost
opportunity
to
tax
was
based
on
claims
that
my
clients
and
50
other
defendants
in
four
consolidated
cases
did
not
send
names
of
customers
to
the
state
of
new
york
and
had
statements
on
their
website
saying
sales
were
tax-free
and
no
tobacco
taxes
applied.
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
all
claims.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
reinstated
one
of
the
city's
rico
claims
against
the
petitioners,
the
hemi
group
and
its
sole
owner,
kai
gachupin,
and
affirmed
dismissal
of
the
city's
other
rico
and
its
common
law
fraud
claims.
yet
reinstating
the
one
rico
claim
was
improper
because
the
city
does
not
have
standing
to
sue,
based
on
the
injuries
that
it
has
alleged.
it
does
not
have
standing
because
the
city's
claim
that
it
lost
the
sovereign
opportunity
to
tax
is
not
an
injury
to
--
to
business,
and
it's
not
an
injury
to
property.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
money
in
the
bank
would
be
property,
mr.
chief
justice
roberts,
but
an
opportunity
to
collect
money
is
an
inchoate
interest,
and
so
it
would
not
be
property
at
that
point.
it
would
be
the
opportunity
to
collect
it.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
the
lawsuit
would
be
--
the
lawsuit
itself
would
be
property,
but
the
--
but
any
recovery
would
not
be
property
until
it
became
choate,
until
there
was
an
amount
of
money
assigned
to
it.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
all
right.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
well,
i'm
wrong
on
the
--
on
the--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--but
i
think
i
am
right
on
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
is
"gruntled".
[laughter]
well,
it
would
--
it
would
be
inchoate
at
the
time
the
--
the
city
was
just
exercising
its
opportunity
to
tax,
but
had
not
--
or
exercising
its
sovereign
right
to
tax,
but
had
not
yet
assessed
the
tax--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--justice
ginsburg,
pasquantino,
the
holding
there
was
--
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution
by
the
u.s.
government,
and
it
dealt
with
the
term
1964(c)
requirement
of
injury
to
business
or
property.
moreover,
it
was
the
taxpayer
who
was
being
prosecuted,
the
person
who
actually
had
taken
the
liquor
into
canada,
not
some
third
party
that
said,
let
me
sell
you
the
liquor.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
justice
ginsburg,
once
the
amount
owed
is
assessed,
once
there's
a
determination
of
the
amount
owed--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--there
was--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--the
prosecution
on
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
criminal
--
well,
criminal
standing
was
not
an
issue
there.
it
was
the
u.s.
government--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--yes,
your
honor,
for
wire
fraud
purposes.
and
the
court
took
a
very
expansive
view
of
property
in
pasquantino.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
for
purposes
of
the
--
of
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
statute,
this
court
has
held
that
property
can
be
for
purposes
of--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--at
the
time,
because
of
the
overlying
standing
requirement
congress
placed
in
rico
of
injury
to
a
person's
business
or
property,
and
because
of
congress's
reliance
at
that
time
on
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
general
understanding
at
that
time
that
business
or
property
did
not
include
the
type
of
sovereign
interest
in
an
opportunity
to
collect
tax,
as
confirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court
in
hawaii
v.
standard
oil
of
california
that
this
court
affirmed,
where
the
sovereign
opportunity
to
tax
is
much
difference
--
different
from
the
actual
collection
of
a
--
of
a
set
amount
of
tax
that
the
government
knows
it
has
coming.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
the
standing
for
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
injury.
a
person
has
standing
who
has
been
injured
in
his
business
or
property.
it's
exactly
the
same
as
in
rico.
in
fact,
congress
took
the
language
from
the
antitrust
laws,
justice
scalia,
and
placed
it
into
rico
unchanged.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
yes,
your
honor.
in
hawaii,
this
court
made
it
clear
that--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--justice
stevens,
it
was
a
claim
of
injury
to
the
general
economy,
which
included--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--yes,
your
honor.
the
state
of
hawaii
brought
three
claims.
one
was
its
injury
to
itself;
one
was
the
potential
class
action;
and
then
the
parens
patriae
claim.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
injury
to
the
general
economy,
the
underlying
claim
was
that
by
losing
that
economic
engine,
that
the
state
itself
would
be
injured
because
of
the
loss
to
the
economy
and
in
its
governmental
functions.
the
actual--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--justice
scalia,
it's
not
an
identified
sum
of
money.
they
don't
know
--
they
can't
tell
who
owed
the
taxes,
in
what
amount,
whether
any
of
those
people
were
eligible
for
the
exemption
under
the
law.
it
was
inchoate.
it
was
not
known.
it
was
not
known
who
owed
it
or--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--they
would
have
to
--
they
would
absolutely
have
to
prove
that
for
purposes
of
damages.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
the
--
the
--
what
they've
alleged
here
is
not
that
they've
lost
the
taxes,
but
that
they've
lost
the
opportunity
to
tax.
moreover,
they
should
not
be
able
to
reach
that
point
because
the
allegations
themselves
are
that
the
injury
is
not
proximate.
it
is
the
city
itself--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--it
is
a
different
issue.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
i
was
hoping
for
a
smooth
transition,
justice
scalia.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
the
--
the
injury
to
the
city
is
much
like
the
injury
in
holmes,
where
the
city
claims
to
be
at
the
tail
end
of
the
chain
of
causation.
they
allege
two
injuries,
sources
of
their
injury.
one
was
that
statements
made
on
an
internet
website
somehow
caused
people
who
purchased
cigarettes
in
new
york
city
not
to
pay.
the
district
court
described
that
source
of
injury
as
farfetched.
those
were
judge
batts'
words.
the
second
source
of
injury
they
claim
is
that
by
not
reporting
to
the
state
of
new
york,
the
city
then
did
not
receive
information
about
which
city
residents
purchased
cigarettes,
and
the
city
could
then
not
go
to
those
residents
who
had
not
self-assessed,
and--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--well,
justice
alito,
the
allegations
here
are
not
that
there
were
no
taxes
due.
there
wasn't
someone
waving
a
tea
bag
and
saying,
"don't
pay
your
taxes".
what
the
website's
allegations
are
is
that
the
sales
are
tax-free,
and
the
sales
were
tax-free.
as
the
city
points
out,
they
--
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
city
to
impose
any
sales
tax
on
these
transactions
which
occurred
on
the
jemez
pueblo
in
new
mexico.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
exactly,
justice
scalia.
it's
a
possessory
tax--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--pardon
me?
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
that's
right.
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
and
the
obligation
to
pay
that
tax
is
on
the
person
who
brings
the
car
into
the
state.
the
obligation
to
pay
the
possessory
use
tax
is
on
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
"sales
are
tax-free".
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
and
"no
tobacco
tax".
those
are
the
two
allegations.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
no,
your
honor,
it's
specifically
not
a
tax
on
tobacco.
it's
a
tax
on
the
possession
of
cigarettes
and
there
are
exemptions
to
it.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
the--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
intervening,
justice
alito,
with
--
with
intervening
causes
of
the
city's
failure
to
collect
these
taxes.
the
--
rico
requires
someone
who
has
been
injured
in
their
business
or
property
by
reason
of
the
alleged
proximate
act,
and
the
fact
is
the
city
here
was
injured
in
its
--
was
injured,
if
at
all,
by
reason
of
its
citizens'
failure
to
self-assess
and
pay
their
taxes.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
jenkins
act
was
--
was
focused
on
allowing
states
to
help
find
those,
and
the
city
is
therefore
outside
the
zone
of
interest.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
proximate
cause
for
a
lawsuit
under
rico
against
the
seller
who
the
person
went
to
and
said:
my
goal
here
is
not
to
pay
taxes;
can
you
help
me
figure
out
a
way
to
get
them
into
the
city
in
a
way
that
i
don't
have
to?
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
an
intervening,
justice
kennedy,
there
would
be
the
intervening
cause
of
the
person's
decision.
it's
--
it's
beyond
the
first
step.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
your
honor,
the
intent
to
injure,
even
if
specific,
as
the
court
held
in
associated
general
contractors,
is
not
itself
sufficient
to
change
--
to
give
someone
standing
under
rico.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
no,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
the
proximate
cause
standard
that
the
court
has
adopted
rests
at
its
core
in
proximate
cause
analysis
in
tort
law.
when
the
court
first
started
applying
proximate
cause
requirements
in
the
antitrust
law
and
in
rico,
it
was
looking
at,
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
the
common
law
analysis
of
proximate
cause,
and
--
and
it
really
discussed
the
elements
of
that
quite
clearly
in
the
associated
general
contractors
case
where
it
talks
about
five
or
six
factors
that
the
court
has
to
look
at,
those
factors
being
the
nature
of
the
plaintiff's
alleged
injury,
is
it
--
whether
it
was
the
type
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
intended
to
forestall,
or
here
the
rico
laws.
we
would
submit
that
it
is
not.
it's
an
injury
to
a
sovereign
interest.
the
directness
of
the
injury.
here
the
injury
is
indirect.
it
either
comes
--
flows
through
the
citizens
who
didn't
pay
their
taxes
or
through
the
state
that
didn't
get
the
reports
of
customers
in
the
city.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
justice
ginsburg,
congress
could
have
given
the
states
power
to
share
those
lists,
but
it
did
not
under
the
jenkins
act.
and
it's
not
clear
that
--
that
--
even
the
agreement--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--the
--
the
agreement,
and
it's
quoted
on
page
6
of
the
response
--
and
i
want
to
get
this
right
--
says,
justice
ginsburg
in
paragraph
1
of
the
quote,
in
footnote
6:
"provided,
that
the
disclosure
of
that
information
is
permissible
under
existing
laws
and
agreements.
"
and
this
is
proprietary
information.
these
are
customer
lists.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
yes,
it
would
be
different,
because
in
that
instance
the
city
would
be
the
--
would
--
would
as
--
would
--
would
be
the
direct
victim,
would
be
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
statute.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
justice
scalia,
it's
a
misdemeanor
violation
and
it
has
to
be
prosecuted
by
the
u.s.
government.
those
--
that's
the
extent
of
the
jenkins
act.
and
--
and
the
--
and
what
the
city
has
done
here,
as
judge
winter
noted
in
his
dissent,
is
take
the
misdemeanor
federal
criminal
law
and
bootstrap
it
into
rico,
seeking
300
cents
on
the
dollar
through
mail
and
wire
fraud.
these
sales
occurred
on
the
jemez
pueblo
in
new
mexico.
and
it's
my
client's
position,
and
it's
no
secret,
he
says
on
his
websites
that
he
doesn't
--
that
the
jenkins
act,
the
scope
of
the
jenkins
act
does
not
include
his
sales.
there
--
there's
a
dispute
with
the
city
on
that,
but
it's
not
even
clear
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
get
these
names,
much
less
the
city.
yet
the
city
is
claiming
because
it
didn't
get
the
names
--
and
if
it
had
the
names
it
claims
a
recovery
rate
between
40
cents
and
55
cents
on
the
dollar
--
it
should
be
able
to
collect
300
cents
on
the
dollar
from
a
business
that
didn't
owe
them
in
the
first
place.
because
the
civil
rico
has
a
separate
standing
requirement
separate
from
mail
and
wire
fraud,
as
justice
o'connor
discussed
in
holmes
that
it's
not
just
the
predicate
act's
standing
requirement,
but
--
but
the
person
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
--
because
congress
took
this
"business
or
property"
language
right
out
of
the
antitrust
laws
unchanged,
the
court
in
hawaii
interpreted
that
language.
the
court
drew
a
bright
line.
it
was
a
pragmatic
line,
a
workable
line,
an
important
line,
that
that
business
or
property
did
not
include
injury
to
a
sovereign
interest.
the
opportunity
to
collect
taxes
is
a
sovereign
interest.
the
taxes
themselves,
once
collected
or
assessed,
could
be
property,
but
not
the
opportunity.
the
injury
flows
either
through
the
states
or
consumers
and,
therefore,
is
not
proximate.
these
websites
were
not
state-specific,
much
less
city-specific.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
it
wouldn't
automatically
be
outside
the
scope
of
proximate
cause,
but
if
--
if
it
was
action
that
made
it
more
or
less
feasible.
but
it
would
be
unreasonable
under
this
court's
decision
in
u.s.
v.
boyle,
where
you
--
where
the
court
held
that
you
cannot
rely
even
on
an
agent
for
purposes
of
not
filing
taxes
--
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
anyone
to
rely
on
language
on
a
vendor's
internet
--
commercial
language
on
a
vendor's
internet
website
to
--
to
--
to
decide
that
for
some
reason
they
didn't
have
an
obligation
to
pay.
and
these
websites
had
language
that
said
--
the
city
attached
the
--
the
pages
from
the
websites
themselves
to
the
--
they
were
part
of
the
record,
the
rico
record.
i
had
those
just
a
second
ago
and
i
can't
seem
to
find
them.
but
the
--
the
website
pages
for
my
client
specifically
had
languages
noted
in
the
briefs
that
said
these
are
not
city-specific
or
state-specific,
that
--
that
you
need
to
contact
--
you
should
contact
your
state
officials
for
purposes
of
determining
what
your
individual
obligations
are
regarding
possession
and
tax.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
in
the
response
to
the
petition,
the
city
said
it's
a
fraction,
i
believe,
of
the
people.
they've
also--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--there
is
an
exemption,
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
two
cartons
of
cigarettes.
and
--
but
--
but
it's
clear
that
possessory
and
use
taxes
are
a
bear
to
collect
for
any
government.
and
the
city
here,
as
i
--
as
stated
in
the
record,
says
even
under
the
best
of
circumstances,
justice
ginsburg,
it
collects
only
40
cents
on
the
dollar,
perhaps
as
much
as
55--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--it
would
rely
on
its
citizens
to
step
forward
and
pay
it.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
and
they
don't.
and
that's
the
intervening
cause
of
the
--
that's--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--it's
a
very
expensive
process,
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
and
it
--
it's
tedious.
you
get
the
names.
you
have
to
go
through
the
names
and
write.
there's
a
cost
involved
in
all
that.
there's
a
lot
of
friction
in
that
entire
process.
there
--
there
are
lots
of
reasons
that,
even
when
the
city
gets
the
names
and
even
under
its
allegations
of
collection
rates,
justice
ginsburg,
very
small,
40
cents
to
55
cents
on
the
dollar.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
it
--
it's
my
understanding,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
state
would
receive
jenkins
act
reports
from
some
vendors.
those
can
come
in
all
sorts
of
different
formats,
some
of
it
just
stacks
of
paper
perhaps.
and
it
would
be
the
state's
responsibility
then
to
go
through
those,
select
which
ones
were
residents
of
the
city
of
new
york,
and
then
decide
whether
under
existing
laws
it
was
even
permitted
to
share
this
proprietary
information
with
the
city,
before
giving
those
to
the
city.
it
would
then
be
the
city's
responsibility
to
take
the
list
given
to
it
by
the
state
and
decide
who
hasn't
paid.
then
there's
the
exemption
issue
that
comes
on
top
of
that.
and
then
go
out
and
try
to
collect
these
amounts,
which
they
allege
to
have
done
in
at
least
two
instances.
finally,
the
policy
--
i'm
sorry.
the
policy
that
this
court
adopted
in
hawaii
makes
a
--
makes
very
much
sense,
as
recognized
by
courts
who
have
looked
at
issues
such
as
additional
fire
protection,
payment
of
--
of
public
benefits,
other
instances
where
governments
have
come
forward
and
under
rico
tried
to
bring
a
claim
to
recover
actual
out-of-pocket
expenses,
overtime
that
was
paid
to
police
that
had
to
monitor
protests
against
abortion
clinics,
public
benefits
paid
to
people
who
were
not
legally
in
the
country
and
working
in
agriculture.
governments
have
brought
those
and
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
in
both
of
those
instances
said
those
are
injury
to
sovereign
interests,
citing
hawaii,
and
not
the
kind
of
injury
to
business
or
property
that
congress
intended
when
it
adopted
rico.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
stevens,
the
city
brought
exactly
that
case,
where
one
of
the
50
defendants
here
was
a
defendant
that
didn't
say
sales
are
tax-free,
and
that
case
was
similarly
dismissed
by
the
district
court,
and
that
dismissal
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit.
justice
breyer,
in
illinois
v.
fawaz,
the
states
was
going
after
$14,500
in
back
sales
and
gasoline
taxes.
after
having
prosecuted
the
individual,
they
were
seeking
civil
rico
damages,
in
that
seventh
circuit
case,
when
the
seventh
circuit
became
the
first
circuit
to
say,
we
--
we
hesitantly
believe
that
the
case
could
go
forward
beyond
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
that
would
be
but
for;
but
for
your
failure
to
give
us
the
names--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--we
would
have
collected.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
this
court
said,
in
holmes,
that
but
for
is
insufficient.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
this
was
an
internet
website,
justice
breyer,
that--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--was
it
foreseeable--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--and
is
it
foreseeable
that
no
one
will
pay
or
that
some
will
pay?
some
will
pay.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
it's
--
it's
foreseeable
that
some
won't
pay.
that's
foreseeable,
but--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--but,
at
that
point,
it
becomes
speculative,
justice
scalia,
and
it's
--
it's
foreseeable
that
some
won't
pay,
but
it's
also
foreseeable
that
some
people
won't
pay--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--i'm
sorry?
i
didn't--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--no,
your
honor,
but,
in
that
instance,
i
would
be
the
one
pushing
the
person,
and
not
the
one
--
i
would
be
the
person,
as
in
pasquantino,
who
did
not--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--yes.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
that
it's
foreseeable
that
they
won't
get
a
lot
of
money?
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
it's
but
for,
and
it
is
foreseeable
that
some
--
some
taxpayers
in
new
york
will
not
pay.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
but
it's
not
a
definition
of
proximate
cause.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
that,
itself
is
not--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--what
--
what
the
court
said
in
associated
general
contractors
is,
even
if
it's
not
only
foreseeable,
but
that's
your
intent,
but
that--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--but--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--it
--
if
we
assume
that
--
that
the
assumption
that
they
will
pay
their
taxes
breaks
the
proximate
cause?
i'm
not
--
i'm
sorry--
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
--yes,
sir.
that's
why
--
that's
why
i'm
trying
to
understand.
[laughter]
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
randolph
h.
barnhouse
that's
a
great
argument,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
