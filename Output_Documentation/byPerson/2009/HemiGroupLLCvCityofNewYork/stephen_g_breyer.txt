justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
get
to
anza,
this
might
be
a
good
time
to
ask
because
i
don't
think
we
focused
on
this
in
pasquantino.
but
if
in
fact
the
failure
of
a
state
to
collect
a
tax
is
property,
then
why
isn't
every
corporation
that
files
an
income
tax
return
and
makes
two
false
statements
automatically
liable
for
rico?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
that
would
mean
the
states
have
a
new
method,
which
i
don't
think
they
use,
a
new
method
of
collecting
treble
taxes
from
anyone
who
makes
two
false
statements
or
a
false
statement
in
two
income
tax
returns,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
would
have
vast
repercussions.
i
mean,
it
might
be
very
beneficial;
the
states
are
having
a
deficit
crisis;
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how,
how
--
why
would
it
not
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
they
left
--
they
don't
have
the
rico
predicate,
not
paying
your
state
taxes.
but
in
effect
you
would
read
into
the
rico
predicate
protecting
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be,
but
nobody
focused
on
this
issue.
so
--
so
that's
what's
bothering
me.
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
stopping
place?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
is
there
one?
and
if
there
is
none,
how
do
we
reconcile
this
view
of
--
they're
suggesting
a
stopping
place,
anza
and
pasquantino
to
the
contrary.
right.
but
they're
suggesting
a
stopping
place
on
a
matter
that
hasn't
come
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
focused
on.
it's
come
up
but
not
focused
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
your
view
california--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
has
a
$10
billion
deficit,
could
go
through,
find
every
instance
where
a
corporation
made
two
false
statements
in
two
tax
returns,
one
in
each,
and
collect
treble
what
they're
owed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
systematic
understatement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
two--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--predicate
acts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
predicate
acts
are
a
deliberate
false
statement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
did,
then
why
didn't
they
put
in
not
paying
your
state
tax
returns
as
a
predicate
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
that
cuts
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
if
they
put
in
one,
your
theory
--
they
don't
even
need,
whether
they
need
that
or
not.
your
theory
applies
to
every
tax,
every
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
go
back
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is,
forget
the
cigarette
taxes.
if
i
accept
your
argument,
am
i
then
saying
that
california,
new
york,
and
every
other
state
that's
owed
money
by
corporations
in
their
taxes
can
go
through,
look
for
two
tax
returns
that
have
a
false
statement
in
them
that
were
mailed
in,
and
thereby
collect
rico
damages?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
a
pretty
far-reaching--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
know
anybody,
any
court
that
has
ever
said
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
congress
wanted
that
result,
why
didn't
they
put
in
as
a
predicate
act
not
paying
your
income
tax
or
not
paying
your
state
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
i
think
that
their
response
to
the
mail
and
fraud
is,
you're
right,
it
is
all
mail
--
it
is
all
mail
fraud.
all
these
tax
violations,
in
fact
every
one,
you
mail
in
your
tax
return
normally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
all
of
these
would
be
mail
fraud.
but
mail
fraud
is
not
a
treble
damages
statute.
and
therefore
the
question
is
who
will
prosecute,
state
or
federal?
so
normally
it's
state
if
it's
a
state
tax.
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
congress
didn't
care
about
that
and
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
congress
didn't
care
if
the
states
were
going
to
use
this
in
order
to
collect
three
times
what
the
taxes
are
owed.
and
so
they're
looking
for
a
way
to
cut
off
this
tax
liability
for
ordinary,
simpleminded
tax
--
failure
to
pay
your
state
taxes.
and
that's
why
they've
hit
on
this
idea
of
the
antitrust.
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
satisfactory
idea.
i
don't
see
the
solution.
i
think
i
see
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
it
that
you
haven't
argued
--
why
haven't
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
is
that
relevant
as
far
as
cause
is
concerned?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
cause,
why
isn't
it
a
causal
connection
for
them
to
say,
look,
your
clients
don't
tell
them
who's
bought
it.
they're
supposed
to,
but
they
don't.
and
if
we
got
the
information,
we
go
write
a
letter
to
the
people,
and
half
of
them
would
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
isn't
that
a
direct
applicant
action,
but
for
foreseeable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
i
know,
but
there
is
more
here.
it
is
also
foreseeable
proximate
cause.
i
mean,
it
is
absolutely
foreseeable,
not
just
but
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
forget
the
website.
what
if
there
had
been
no
website?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
foreseeable
that,
when
they
don't
know
who
owes
the
money,
that
the
people
won't
pay,
but
when
they
know
who
owes
the
money,
they
can
write
them
a
letter,
and
half
pay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
pay.
some
don't.
they
have
the
numbers
there.
they
get
more
than
half.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
if
you
put
people
in
front
of
railroad
trains
and
half
survive,
then
it's
speculative?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if
you
put
somebody
in
front
of
a
railroad
train
and
half
survive
because
they
jumped,
does
that
make
it
a
speculative
cause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
it's
foreseeable
that
they
won't
get
a
lot
of
money.
and
that's
what
they're
arguing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
is
because
of
what
your
clients
did,
so
it's
but
for
and
foreseeable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
end
of
case.
now,
we
go
to
the
damage
section.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
took
torts
a
long
time
ago.
i
thought
that
was
part
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
there
can
be
other
things
that
cut
it
off.
proximate
cause.
foreseeable.
no
kind
of
an
event
that
would
cut
the
causal
chain,
like
some
odd
fluke
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
policy
reason
or
others
for
cutting
the
chain.
i
mean,
it's
torts
1
in
1962,
okay?
