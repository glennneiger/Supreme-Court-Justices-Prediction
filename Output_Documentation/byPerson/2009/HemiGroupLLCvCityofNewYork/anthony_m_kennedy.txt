justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
--
suppose
you
had
a
case
in
which
an
individual
that
lives
in
new
york
goes
to
a
person
with
a
supply
of
cigarettes
outside
the
state
and
says:
i
want
to
buy
a
lot
of
cigarettes
and
i
don't
want
to
pay
taxes;
can
you
help
me?
and
they
agree
on
an
arrangement
to
ship,
to
ship
the
cigarettes.
is
there
proximate
cause?
is
it
there
if
the
city
sues
for
injury
in
that
hypothetical
case?
would
you
say
there's
no
proximate
cause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
think
the
city
--
and
you
think
the
city
cannot
show
proximate
cause
in
a
suit
for
its
injury
against
the
seller
of
the
cigarettes?
you
think
there's
no
proximate
cause
in
that
hypothetical
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
those
are
the
only
two
people
that
have
made
the
arrangement,
and
that
was
the
whole
purpose
and
intent
of
the
arrangement?
and
you
still
say
there's
no
proximate
cause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
do
you
do
with
--
what
do
you
do
with
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical?
i
mean,
she
can
pursue
her
own
question,
but
i'm
interested
in
the
answer.
her
question
is,
suppose
the
statute
were
amended
so
that
the
information
had
to
be
given
to
the
city
as
well
as
to
the
state;
would
the
case
then
be
different,
hypothetical
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
satisfy
justice
breyer's
concern
--
and
maybe
the
answer
is
not
--
by
saying
that
if
there
were
a
corporation
that
went
around
to
california
taxpayers
and
said,
we
have
a
way
to
avoid
taxes,
that
then
there
would
be
a
rico
violation,
and
that
would
be
closer
to
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
--
well,
you're
certainly
consistent
and
persistent
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
--
it
would
seem
to
me
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
i
gave
you
a
way
to
differentiate
this
case.
and
isn't
that
consistent
with
rico
because
we
have
a
very
specific
enterprise
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
do
you
say
then
that
proximate
cause
is
in
part
established
because
of
the
specific
intent?
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i'm
glad
--
i'm
glad
you
said
that,
because
the
associated
contractors
said
specific
intent
is
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
in
--
in
the
world
and
in
the
lexicon
of
proximate
cause,
why
is
there
proximate
cause
because
this
was
the
business
model?
how
do
i
explain
that
in
terms
of
proximate
cause?
there's
not
specific
intent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know.
but
there
is
no
other
--
take
a
case
which
was
put
to
you
as
the
seller
who
has
many
reasons
for
selling
from
out
of
state.
they
have
a
good
catalog
business,
it's
a
well-established
name,
and
so
it's
not
just
to
avoid
taxes.
how
is
that
different
from
what
happened
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
and
in
terms
of
proximate
--
the
universe
of
the
law
that
we
call
proximate
cause,
how
do
you
explain
that?
it's
not
specific
intent.
