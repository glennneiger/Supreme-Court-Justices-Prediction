putting
aside
the
fact
that
the
jenkins
act
information
would
be
sent
to
the
state
rather
than
the
city,
why
--
how
can
you
--
how
can
it
be
said
that
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation
that
it's
farfetched
that
having
a
statement
on
the
website
"no
taxes
due"
is
--
doesn't
cause
people
to
purchase
those
cigarettes
for
the
very
purpose
of
avoiding
the
taxes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
isn't
that
just
a
question
--
a
substantive
fraud
question,
rather
than
a
proximate
cause
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
--
is
it
fraudulent
to
say
"sales
are
tax-free"
as
opposed
to,
you
know,
saying
no
taxes
are
due?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
--
to
prevail
on
that
theory,
would
you
have
to
prove
that
these
--
these
alleged
misrepresentations
in
fact
caused
people
not
to
pay
taxes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
to
prove
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
think
you
could
prove
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
--
what
percentage
of
the
--
of
the
residents
of
new
york
state
or
new
york
city
voluntarily
pay
a
use
tax
on
their
income
tax
returns
for
items
that
they
purchase
on
the
internet?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
make
a
guess?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
a
difference
--
would
appreciate
if
you
would
tell
me
the
difference
between
your
argument
as
to
this
situation
and
the
typical
internet
site
where
i
think
a
lot
of
people
buy
goods
on
the
internet,
because
they're
convenient
and
also
because
they
know
that
they're
not
going
to
have
to
pay
state
sales
tax
when
they
make
those
purchases.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
a
company
that
is
selling
cameras,
televisions,
whatever
over
the
internet
and
they
--
you
know,
you
put
your
--
you
put
in
your
credit
card
information
or
whatever,
and
then
it
tells
you,
"sales
tax
due",
and
if
they
have
no
outlet
in
the
state,
it
says
"sales
taxes
due:
zero".
what
is
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
this
situation?
