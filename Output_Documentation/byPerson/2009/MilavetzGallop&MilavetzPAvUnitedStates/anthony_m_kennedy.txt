if
it
were
confined
to
unlawful
activity
and
narrowly
drawn,
do
you
concede
that
such
a
statute
would
be
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
"perhaps".
yes
or
no?
can
congress
by
an
appropriately,
an
appropriately
drawn
narrow
statute,
prohibit
attorneys
from
advising,
a,
criminal
conduct
in
reference
to
a
bankruptcy;
or,
b,
civil
conduct
--
conduct
that
is
improper
under
the
civil
code
because
it's
a
fraud
on
creditors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
again
in
the
hypothetical
context,
could
congress
enforce
by
a
statute
what
it
requires
in
the
attestation
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
the
attestation
clause
cannot
be
the
basis
for
sanctioning
an
attorney?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
how
can
that
be
if
it's
too
vague.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
attestation
clause
is
designed
to
ensure
that
the
attorney
has
performed
in
an
ethical
and
proper
way,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
one
of
its
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
won't
take
up
too
much
more
of
your
argument,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
odd
that
you
can
enforce
an
attestation
clause,
but
not
a
statute
that
does
the
same
thing.
i
don't
understand
the
principle
for
that.
you
say
it's
a
gateway
and
it's
designed
to
facilitate
the
bankruptcy
process.
well,
the
government
could
say
the
same
thing
about
its
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
congress
often
forgets
about
the
first
amendment,
but
lawyers
don't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
assume
a
proper
limited
construction
--
i
know
you
disagree
with
that,
but
if
we
assume
that
we
can
limit
the
statute
properly
so
that
it
applies
just
to
unethical
conduct,
then
you
can't
give
that
advice
to
anybody,
and
the
fact
that
assisted
persons
is
a
subclass
of
that
is
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that
doesn't
go
to
your
other
point
that
there's
a
problem
in
determining
the
class
of
persons.
if
it's
unethical,
you
can't
give
it
to
anybody.
and
the
fact
that
the
class
of
persons
is
difficult
to
understand
is
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
heard
of
referring
to
legislative
history
when
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
i
haven't
heard
of
referring
to
legislative
history
to
make
the
statute
ambiguous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a,
i
suppose
you
don't
have
to
advertise;
or
b,
if
you
do,
you
can
say
in
your
bread
hypo:
under
the
federal
law
we
have
bread,
but
our
bread
is
--
i
don't
know
--
gluten-free
or
whatever.
you
can
use--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
can
always
add
--
add
in
order
to
make
it
non-misleading.
