mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
526(a)(4)
is
unconstitutional
because
it
proscribes
truthful
information
about
entirely
lawful
activity,
it
whipsaws
the
attorneys
who
are
trying
to
apply
it,
it
creates
an
impossible
situation
for
them,
and
it
harms
the
client.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
perhaps,
justice
kennedy,
but
the
real
challenge
is
to
actually
do
that
narrowing--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
if
it
were
narrowly
drawn
to
apply
to
criminal
activity
or
fraudulent
activity,
yes.
those
terms
have
well-established
meanings.
we
know
how
to
apply
them.
this
statute,
of
course,
does
not
do
that.
now,
the
government
does
not
defend
the
statute
as
written.
the
government
seeks
to
rewrite
it,
but
the
manner
in
which
the
government
seeks
to
rewrite
the
statute
really
doesn't
work
under
the
statutory
terms.
we
do
not
have
that
guidance.
the
government
in
its
brief
proposes
three
different
formulations
of
how
it
might
be
narrowed.
none
of
those
work,
even
if
we
--
we
were
to
accept
any
of
those
formulations.
we
don't
know
what
"abusive
conduct"
means.
the
government
simply
would
trade
a
first
amendment
problem
for
a
vagueness
problem.
we
do
not
have--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
two
reasons,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
the
707(b)
abuse
standard
is
a
completely
different
context.
it
involves
gatekeeping
to
the
access
to
bankruptcy
relief.
the
second
reason
is
that
congress
--
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever,
in
the
legislative
history
or
elsewhere,
that
congress
intended
to
import
the
abuse
standard
under
section
707
into
the
526(a)(4)
context.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
abuse
standard
is
too
nebulous
to
satisfy,
i
think,
scrutiny
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
can
be
the
basis
for
sanctioning
an
attorney--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
gateway
to
the
bankruptcy
procedures
or
basically
provisions,
like
section
707
or
in
the
chapter
11
context,
basically
are
equitable
inquiry
that
looks
into
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
whether
what
the
lawyer
has
done
or
what
the
debtor
has
done
--
and
really
it
looks
to
what
the
debtor
has
done
--
would
be
such
that
it
would
deny
access
to
bankruptcy
relief.
has
the
debtor
engaged
in
inequitable
conduct,
engaged
in
inequitable
conduct
in
some
way
that
would
basically
shut
the
door
to
bankruptcy
relief?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
in
a
sense.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
think
it
goes
more
towards
the
attorney
checking
the
information
that
the
debtor
has
basically
provided
in
the
petition
and
elsewhere
to
make
sure
that
the
information
that's
provided
is
accurate
and
that
the
bankruptcy
petition
is
not
being
proposed
in
essence
for
an
abusive
purpose.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
except,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
whereas
for
the
purposes
of
getting
into
bankruptcy
or
staying
in
bankruptcy
is
one
standard
that
courts
apply
basically
on
an
equitable
basis,
that
analysis
--
what
congress
did
there,
it
didn't
have
in
mind
first
amendment
concerns.
it
didn't
have
in
mind
trying
to
narrowly
tailor
the
statutory
regime
so
that
lawyers
basically
can
understand
what
they
are
doing
in
a
way
and
communicate
it
to
their
client.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
heart
of
the
problem
here.
the
problem
here
is
that
when
congress
basically
--
first
of
all,
congress
didn't
import
the
707(b)
standard
into
526(a)(4)--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress,
in
the
legislative
history
or
otherwise,
that
congress
intended
the
707{b}
standard
to
be
the
standard
that
governs
what
the
lawyer
can
tell
the
client
under
section
526
(a)(4)--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
stevens,
but
this
statute
is
not
reasonable
susceptible
to
the
government's
interpretation.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
but
the
problem
here
is
that
what
the
government
has
tried
to
do
is
tease
out
a
standard
from
the
526(a)(4),
and
the
problem
is
that
--
two
problems:
one,
the
"in
contemplation
of"
language
only
modifies
half
the
statute,
so
the
"or
pay
the
attorney"
prong
is
not
even
addressed
by
the
government's
narrowing
construction.
they
kind
of
ignore
that.
the
second
problem
is
that
the
"in
contemplation
of"
language
cannot
bear
the
weight
the
government
would
have
it
bear--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
think
it
means
what
the
court
said
it
meant
in
the
pender
case
interpreting
section
60(d)
of
the
former
bankruptcy
act
of
1898.
that
is,
whether
bankruptcy
is
likely
or
imminent;
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy,
taking
some
action
where
a
bankruptcy
case
is
imminent
or
likely.
now,
it
appears--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--not
necessarily,
justice
alito.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
would--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
think
that
that
would
assume
that
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
looms
entirely
in
the
consciousness
of
the
debtor
when
the
debtor
does
everything.
but
i
do
--
i
do
think
that
the
329,
is
a
neutral
phrase.
"in
contemplation
of"
means
nothing
more
than
is
the
bankruptcy
filing
likely?
it
doesn't
have
any
nefarious,
it
doesn't
have
any
abusive
context
to
it
at
all.
for
example,
section
329--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
do
see
a
causal
connection,
but
there
is
no
element
of
doing
something
improper
in
the
language
"in
contemplation
of".
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
scalia.
but
the
government
relies
and
hinges
its
argument
on
the
abusive
connotation
to
the
"in
contemplation
of".
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
doesn't
exist.
so
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
is
rewrite
the
statute
by
importing
meaning
into
a
phrase
that
has
never
been
there
and
doesn't
exist
there.
every
time
we
see
the
"in
contemplation
of"
phrase
appearing
either
under
the
current
law
or
under
a
prior
law,
if
there
was
some
element
of
abuse
coupled
with
it
that
was
separately
stated,
and
of
course
there
is
no
separate
statement
here.
now,
again
i
go
back
to
the
fact
that
this
--
the
practical
effect
of
section
526(a)(4)
is
to
make
an
impossible
situation
for
attorneys.
we
have
two
regimes:
one
under
applicable
normal
ethical
state
bar
rules
which
say
you
have
to
give
unfettered
candid
advice
to
your
client;
and
this
provision
which
gives
you
must
give
truncated
advice;
there
are
thing
you
cannot
say.
but
whether
you
are
in
one
regime
or
another
depends
upon
whether
the
debtor
is--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
so,
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--you
cannot,
no.
that
is
proscribed
by
the
state
rules.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
wouldn't
protect
your
right
to
give
unethical
advice.
the
problem
is
that
the
statute
sweeps
within
it's
scope
perfectly
truthful
advice
about
lawful
activity.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
but
just
as--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--the
first
amendment
would
not
protect
unethical
advice.
the
problem,
though,
is
that
the
term
"abusive"
which
the
government
wants
to
interlineate
into
the
statute
is
itself
inherently
vague,
unlike
"fraudulent
conduct"--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because
"abusive",
it's
like
"seditious
utterances".
it's
not
something
which
a
normal
person
who
just
looks
at
it
would
be
able
to
understand
what
it
means.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
have
some
ideas
about
what
means.
but
because
of
the
onerous
sanctions
that
section
526(c)
imposes,
if
i'm
wrong
i
can
be
basically
subject
to
a
whole
panoply
of
remedies,
some
very
serious
remedies
and
very
serious
punishments
for
making
a
mistake.
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
under
the
first
amendment--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i'll
give
you--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
i'll
give
you
--
i'll
give
you
a
perfect
example.
suppose
the
debtor's
problem
is
that
he
lives
in
a
house
that
is
too
expensive
for
him.
he
comes
to
the
lawyer:
i'm
in
financial
distress.
the
lawyer
suggests
--
the
lawyer
would
logically
suggest:
why
don't
you
sell
your
house
and
rent
an
apartment?
but
the
signing
of
the
lease
is
incurring
debt,
the
lease
obligation.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
would
be,
justice
scalia,
if
the
debtor
comes
to
you
in
financial
distress,
is
thinking
about
filing
for
bankruptcy,
and
wants
the
advice
in
that
context.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
it's
perfectly
legitimate
advice
about
perfectly
lawful
activity--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
what
happens
is
that
basically
it
interferes
with
the
lawyer's
ability
through
speech
to
communicate
full
and
candid
advice
to
the
client.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
ultimately
under--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
this
stupid
law
does
not
pass
either
strict
scrutiny
and
it
is
substantially
overbroad.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
doesn't
turn
on
that,
but
that
demonstrates
the
chilling
effect.
the
effect
of
the
statute
has
been
to
drive
conscientious
bankruptcy
counsel
from
the
practice.
why?
because
it's
not
just
difficult
to
apply;
it's
often
impossible
to
apply.
the
whole
statute
turns
on
whether
the
debtor,
the
client
or
prospective
client,
is
an
assisted
person,
which
depends
on
the
relative
wealth
of
the
client,
which
is
something
very,
very
difficult
to
determine
at
any
particular
given
point
in
time.
so
the
lawyer
doesn't
know:
am
i
restricted
in
my
speech
under
526(a)(4)
because
that
applies
or
does
526(a)(4)
not
apply
at
all
because
i
am
not
dealing
with
an
assisted
person,
such
that
i
am
under
normal
state
bar
rules
which
requires
me
to
give
unfettered
advice?
and
since
that
is
impossible
to
know
without
detailed,
careful
analysis
of
the
relative
wealth
of
the
client,
the
statute
is
basically
impossible
to
apply--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that
would
be
true,
justice
kennedy,
if
in
fact
we
could
tease
out
from
the
abusive
conduct,
if
people
could
actually
understand
what
"abusive"
meant.
does
that
proscribe
--
what
does
it
proscribe?
it's
too
vague.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
but
that
assumes
that
we
can
do
the
narrowing
construction,
i
think
as
your
honor
points
out.
and
that,
again,
is
a
fundamental
problem
because
the
standard
the
government
would
like
to
impose
or
interlineate
in
the
statute
is
entirely
vague.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
our
point
on
the
statutory
construction
piece
is
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
that
to
avoid
the
constitutional
questions
--
actually,
avoid
two
constitutional
questions
here,
the
constitutional
question
under
526(a)(4)
and
then
a
separate
constitutional
question
under
528(a)(4)
and
(b)(2)(b)--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--certainly
not,
justice
scalia,
which
is
why--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
our
argument
there,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
statute
does
not
unambiguously
embrace
attorneys.
101(12)(a)
where
you
think
it
would
be,
because
wherever
congress
has
otherwise
intended
to
regulate
attorneys
in
connection
with
bankruptcy
practice,
it
has
used
the
word
"attorney"
specifically.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
is
also
true,
justice
scalia,
because
we
do
make
a
substantial
overbreadth
argument.
the
statute
is
substantially
overbroad.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
a
lawyer
does,
justice
breyer.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
problem,
justice
breyer,
is
that
i
think
when
your
honor
was
quoting
from
section
101(4a),
your
honor
took
out
a
whole
lot
of
information
that
goes
between
the
word
"bankruptcy
assistance"
and
"legal
representation".
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
not
only
that,
but
i
think
that
that
language
is
inherently
ambiguous.
what
is
congress
getting
at
there?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
would
seem
to
be
with
respect
to
lawyers.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
it's
precluded
--
it's
preceded
by
language,
"any
goods
or
services
sold
or
otherwise
provided
to
an
assisted
person
with
the
express
or
implied
purpose
of
providing
information,
et
cetera,
about
legal
representation.
"
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
not
just
other
people,
but
what
it
looks
like,
is
it
looks
like
what
congress
was
getting
at
was
people
who
provide
things
like
what
attorneys
provide.
now,
there
are
a
whole
host
of
problems
with
including
attorneys
within
the
definition
of
"debt
relief
agency".
i
mean,
it's
counter
--
it's
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
what
congress
seemed
to
be
getting
at.
it
leads
to
anomalous
results.
it
does
various
things--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
but
there
it
was
interesting.
there,
there
--
in
the
heintz
case,
that
was
a
situation
where
lawyers
had
been
expressly
excluded
from
the
statutory
regime,
then
congress
repealed
the
exclusion,
so
a
clear
signal
to
include
attorneys.
here,
we
have
the
opposite.
we
have
a
very
ambiguous
legislative
history,
where
in
the
initial
version
of
this
legislation
the
house
report
accompanying
it
said
lawyers
were
included
and
the
language
was
"debt
relief
counseling
agency".
then
congress
amended
the
statute
--
congress
amended
the
proposed
legislation
in
1999,
and
thereafter
in
the
2001,
2003,
and
2005
house
reports
deleted
all
reference
to
attorneys
--
a
very,
very
strange
tale,
which
seems
to
signal
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
heintz
case.
so
we
have
a
very
ambiguous
legislative
history
that
seems
to
give
us
a
contrary
signal.
that
in
part
is
part
of
the
ambiguity
behind
this
statute,
which
i
think
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it's
perfectly
--
the
statute
is
readily
susceptible
to
an
interpretation--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--there
are
some
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
there
are
a
few
scattered
references
in
the
legislative
history.
but
again,
the
legislative
history
is
very
ambiguous.
it
seems
to
go
in
lots
of
different
directions.
now,
recall,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
statute
is
ambiguous
for
a
whole
host
of
reasons,
and
the
legislative
history
does
not
clear
up
the
ambiguity;
it
actually
deepens
it.
so
the
legislative
history
reinforces
the
other
indicators,
the
textual
indicators,
of
in
fact
ambiguity
here.
but
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
underscore
not
only
would
the
constitutional
avoidance,
application
of
that
canon
here,
by
excluding
attorneys
from
debt
relief
agencies
solve
the
problem
under
section
526(a)(4),
but
also
under
section
528(a)(4)
and
(b)(2)(b).
528--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--528,
justice
sotomayor?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
does
your
honor
mean
526
or
528?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
528.
528,
the
disclosures
in
the
advertising
provision?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
are
challenging
that
on
as-applied
it
violates
the
constitution--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
the
same
as
the
cincinnati
case,
where
in
fact
there
was
no
obligation
that
the
handbills
that
were
being
distributed
were
any
way
deceptive
or
misleading.
that's
the
same
situation
here.
the
district
court--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
ads
are
not
in
the
record.
but,
as
the
district
court
found,
there
is
no
evidence
suggesting
that
bankruptcy
assistance
advertisements
that
--
that
petitioners'
bankruptcy
advertisements
are
deceptive
in
any
regard.
the
government
never
alleged
that
petitioners
engaged
in
any
deceptive
advertising.
that's--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--with
respect
to
the
advertisements
with
the
commercial
speech?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
facial
challenge;
it's
an
as-applied
challenge.
but
here
--
here's
the
point
on
the
evidentiary
point.
the
government
never
sought
to
introduce
that
evidence
because
it's
not
at
issue.
there
is
no
dispute
that
petitioners'
advertisement
is
not
--
is--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--we
brought
this
lawsuit
as
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
unless
there
was
an
allegation
that
in
some
way
petitioners'
advertisements
were
misleading.
it's
not.
it's
not
a
disputed
question.
it's
not
a
disputed
factual
question.
there
is
no
dispute,
and
the
district
court
basically
found
that
there
is
no
allegation
that
petitioners'
advertising
is
deceptive
or
untruthful
in
any
way.
so
petitioners'
advertising
is
not
of
the
kind
that
congress
was
trying
to
target.
now,
the
problem
and
the
burden
that
528
imposes
is
that
it
requires
counterfactual,
misleading
statements
that
interfere
with
legitimate
advertising
messages.
that's
the
problem.
the
statute
is
not
narrowly
tailored
under
central
hudson
to
address
the
"make
debts
disappear"
problem
the
government
identifies
as
animating
this
particular
statute.
let
me
give
a
simple
illustration
to
sort
of
illustrate
my
point.
suppose
i
sell
bread
and
the
government
required
me
to
say
--
disclose:
i
am
a
bread
supply
agency;
i
sell
products
that
contain
wheat.
well,
what
if
the
bread
i
sell
does
not
contain
wheat,
it's
wheat-free?
forcing
me
to
make
that
statement
is
counterfactual
and
misleading.
that's
what
this
statute
does.
if
i
also
sell
milk,
it
requires
me
to
make
the
statement:
i
am
the
bread
relief
--
the
bread
supply
agency--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--the
problem,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
that
statement
inherently
is
misleading.
when
lawyers
--
when
clients
look
for
lawyers,
bankruptcy
lawyers
or
just
lawyers
in
general,
they
don't
want
to
see
someone
called
a
debt
relief
agency.
it
conveys
no
meaningful
information.
in
fact,
it's
misleading.
what
does
that
mean?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
but
the
debt
collection
statute
doesn't
require
that
in
advertising.
it
requires
that
in
letters
and
things
like
that
that
go
to
other
parties
where
you
are
actually
trying
to
help
collect
the
debt.
so
it's
a
communication
that
the
lawyer
is
making,
for
example,
and
a
disclosure
that's
required.
here
putting
in
your
advertising
"i'm
a
debt
collection
agency"
conveys
no
meaningful
information
to
the
public.
in
fact,
it
is
misleading.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
that
would
require
a
statement
in
our
advertising
that
is
actually
--
to
make
it
fundamentally
dissimilar
to
the
statement
that's
being
actually
imposed
on
us,
we
have
to
say
--
we
have
to
put
in
the
advertising
something
like
"this
product
contains
wheat".
then
we
also
have
to
say,
but
my
product
doesn't.
so,
for
the
consumer
who
is
looking
at
the
information,
it's
inherently
misleading
because
the
two
conflict--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
scalia,
but
this
statute
is
odd
because
it
requires
counterfactual
information,
it's
not
narrowly
drawn
to
address
the
problem
the
government
identifies.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
the
scope
of
528(b)(2)(b)
is
so
broad.
if
i
am
advertising
mortgage
foreclosure
services
having
nothing
to
do
with
bankruptcy,
i
still
must
make
this
counterfactual
statement.
528
--
for
example,
in
my
bread
hypothetical,
if
i
am
also
selling
milk,
and
the
government
says
when
i
am
selling
milk
through
my
milk
advertisement
i
have
to
say
i
am
a
bread
supply
agency,
i
sell
products
that
contain
wheat,
that
is
commpletelt
misleading
and
irrelevant
to
the
milk
advertisement.
but
this
statute
does
the
same
thing.
if
i
am
advertising
eviction
protection
services
having
nothing
to
do
with
bankruptcy
or
mortgage
foreclosure
services
representation
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
bankruptcy,
i
have
to
make
these
counterfactual
statements
that
are
inherently
misleading.
if
there
are
no
questions
at
the
moment,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
ginsburg,
your
example
about
the
woman
who
is
in
need
of
medical
attention
falls
squarely
within
the
statute.
the
lawyer
would
be
prohibited
from
advising
her
to
incur
debt
to
get
needed
medical
attention,
and
the
government,
in
trying
to
articulate
a
way
around
that
during
the
course
of
the
argument,
articulated
no
less
than
five
different
standards.
the
conduct
would
have
to
be
fraudulent
or
unethical
or
abusive
or
criminal
or
improper.
none
of
those
are
in
the
statute,
and
it's
impossible
to
know
which
one.
chief
justice
roberts,
you
are
absolutely
right:
what
this
statute
does
is
it's
basically
trying
to
interfere
with
the
attorney-client
relationship,
and
even
moreso
on
the
side
of
"or
pay
an
attorney".
and
justice
breyer,
here's
how
it
works.
the
client
comes
to
--
the
prospective
client
comes
to
the
lawyer
and
is
in
trouble.
and
may
not
know
whether
the
client
has
to
file
for
bankruptcy
or
not.
so
there
is
a
conversation
that
happens.
and
in
that
conversation,
it
may
be
decided
that
the
best
thing
for
the
client
to
do
is
to
file
for
bankruptcy,
and
of
course,
the
client
will
have
to
know:
how
am
i
going
to
pay
for
this?
well,
there
are
two
ways.
one,
the
client
can
pay
the
attorney
in
full,
up
front,
or
the
attorney
can
take
payment
over
time.
however,
this
all
happens
before
bankruptcy,
so
there
is
no
involvement
of
the
court
at
this
point.
if
the
attorney
accepts
payment
over
time,
which
many
do,
because
it's
very
expensive
to
file
for
bankruptcy
now
and
most
debtors
don't
have
the
wherewithal,
the
attorney,
by
saying,
i
take
payment
over
time,
and
the
debtor
accepting
that,
the
debtor
would
be
incurring
debt
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy.
incurring
debt
to
the
attorney.
the
attorney
would
be
proscribed,
under
the
statute,
from
actually
giving
that
particular
advice.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
you
can't--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because
you
can't
advise
the
client
in
advance
to
incur
that
debt.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
that
has
to
happen
anyway
under
section--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because
there,
in
that
situation,
you
would
be
advising
the
client
to
incur
the
debt.
remember,
it's
advising
the
client
to
incur
the
debt,
not
the
actual
incurrence
of
the
debt.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
except
debt--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
debt
is--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
think
it
includes
both,
justice
scalia.
for
example,
you
couldn't
advises
your
client
to
borrow
$1,000
from
your
mother.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
you
couldn't
--
and
you
also,
i
think,
advise
a
client
to
basically
borrow
money
from
you,
the
attorney.
you're
extending
services
on
credit;
that's
incurring
a
debt.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
the
statute--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it's
at
least
unclear,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is
the
heart
of
the
problem.
it's
very
unclear.
