g.

now,
but
when
you
say
it
isn't
referred
to,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
referred
to.
it
says
"the
term
"debt
relief
agency"
means--
"
"any
person
who
provides
any
bankruptcy
assistance
to
an
assisted
person.
"
and
the
term
"bankruptcy
assistance"
is
defined
to
include
"appearing
in
a
case
or
proceeding
on
behalf
of
another
or
providing
legal
representation
with
respect
to
a
case
or
proceeding.
"
doesn't
a
lawyer
provide
legal
representation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
doesn't
the
term
"provide
legal
representation"
include
a
lawyer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes;
they
include
other
people
besides
lawyers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
what
is
it
getting
at
with
"providing
legal
representation
with
respect
to
a
case?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
seem
to
be
a
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
those
are
other
people
who
are
covered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
--
what
i
think
his
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
is
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
"bankruptcy
assistance",
you
will
see
there
are
seven
different
things
that
a
person
could
do
and
fall
within
that
definition.
and
all
of
those
seven
things
are
probably
provided
by
the
kinds
of
agencies
you
see
advertised
on
television,
which
say:
we
will
help
you
with
your
debts.
and
they
probably
aren't
lawyers.
and,
so,
if
you
look
at
the
six
of
the
seven
things,
it's
clear
that
all
of
those
are
provided
by
those
television
companies.
and
the
seventh
is
simply
added
in,
namely
the
providing
legal
representation,
to
be
a
catch-all
to
be
sure
that
if
one
of
those
companies
actually
does
something
that
is
legal
representation,
even
though
they
are
not
lawyers,
they
are
caught,
too.
so
he
is
saying,
read
the
whole
paragraph
and
then
you
will
see
they
are
after
the
companies
that
appear
on
television
and
they're
not
after
lawyers.
and
then
he
says
that's
the
history
of
the
bill,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
okay.
now,
that's
the
argument,
and
so
it
isn't
--
can't
quite
be
brushed
off
as
quickly,
i
think,
as
you
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
there
could
not
only
be
lawyers.
i
mean,
there
are
numerous
proceedings
where
your
brother,
your
mother,
your
cousin,
your
friend
appears
for
you.
they
say:
bring
a
friend,
bring
one
of
us.
[laughter]
we
will
charge
you
very
little,
we
will
save
you
money.
i
am
a
lawyer,
by
the
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
relatives
who
aren't,
and
you
can
bring
one
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
how
this
works
exactly.
i'm
not
an
expert.
i
thought
that,
when
someone
goes
bankrupt,
that
one
of
the
things
you
ask
the
bankruptcy
judge
for
is
permission
to
pay
for
ongoing
expenses,
and
that
would
include
an
attorney's
fee.
otherwise,
people
could
never
be
represented.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
why
is
there
some
incentive
here?
all
the
attorney
has
to
do
is
follow
ordinary
procedure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
attorney
says
is,
here's
what
we
will
do;
when
we
file
for
bankruptcy,
i
will
ask
the
court
to
approve
my
own
fees
as
something
that
is
continuing
after
bankruptcy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
says,
this
is
what
they
will
be.
so
what
is
the
harm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--since
that's
what
he
has
to
do,
of
making
him
tell
his
client
that
that's
what
he
has
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
you
--
you
can't?
this
prevents
you
had
from
saying,
what
i'm
going
to
do
is
ask
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
approve
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course.
and
so
what's
wrong
with
the
law
that
tells
the
lawyer
that's
what
he
has
to
tell
the
client?
