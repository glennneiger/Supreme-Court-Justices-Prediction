wait.
it
doesn't
mean
is
it
likely.
"in
contemplation
of"
means
that
the
reason
you
are
doing
this
is
the
contemplated
bankruptcy.
you
don't
see
any
causal
connection
in
that
phrase?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true.
that
may
be
true
enough.
but
--
but
the
act
must
be
taken
because
you
are
about
to
file
a
bankruptcy
petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
leave
"abusive"
out.
let's
accept
your
point
that
"abusive"
is
not
there
and
the
government
is
reading
in
out
of
nowhere.
what's
--
what's
the
matter
with
the
statute
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
prohibits
giving
advice
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy
that
somebody
incur
more
debt.
what's
unlawful
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
only
reason
the
lawyer
gives
the
advice
is
because
he
knows
that
this
--
that
this
debtor
is
planning
to
file
bankruptcy,
he
says,
if
you
are
going
to
file
bankruptcy,
you
better
sell
the
house
and
move
to
an
apartment,
then
it's
no
good.
now,
it
may
be
a
stupid
law,
but
i
don't
see
why
it's
--
why
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
a
stupid
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
and
that's
why
it's
a
stupid
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
where
is
the
prohibition
of
stupid
laws
in
the
constitution?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
lawyers
who
are
protected
against
vague
criminal
statutes?
it's
okay
for
the
rest
of
the
world
to
have
to
--
cope
with
this
--
vagueness,
but
once
you
take
lawyers
out
of
it
it's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
--
so
then
there
is
no
reason
in
particular
to
take
lawyers
out
of
it
just
to
make
it
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
if
you
--
if
you
are
letting
that
argument
stand
on
its
own,
that's
a
fine
argument.
but
don't
--
don't
bring
in
the
fact
that,
well
then,
moreover,
if
it's
applied
to
attorneys,
it's
unconstitutional,
because
if
it's
applied
to
anybody
it's
unconstitutional
according
to
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
proposal
for
a
commercial
transaction,
right?
you
are
trying
to
get
a
consumer
to
hire
you.
and
the
first
amendment
standards
for
proposals
for
commercial
transactions
have
always
been
more
--
more
lenient
than
other
first
amendment
contexts.
we
--
we
--
we
regulate
the
content
of
advertising
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
if
indeed
"in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy"
means,
as
--
as
you
argue,
that
it
has
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
abusing
the
bankruptcy
code
--
right?
if
that's
true,
then
aren't
all
these
vagueness
arguments
irrelevant,
because
it
would
be
illegal
anyway,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
without
this
statute,
the
lawyer
would
have
to
worry
about
--
about
whether
he's
doing
something
that
is
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
lawyer
runs
that
risk
anyway,
whether
this
statute
applies
or
not.
he
has
--
he
has
to
decide
whether
what
he
is
doing
is
a
fraud
on
creditors.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they're
--
if
they're,
as
the
hypothetical
suggests,
representing
only
big
companies,
they're
probably
not
advertising
to
the
general
public
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
read
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
given
as
coming
within
the
statute.
i
think
what
--
what
it
means:
incurred
debt
to
pay
an
attorney,
i
don't
think
it
means
debt
to
the
attorney.
you
are
not
worried
about
the
attorney
cheating
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
making
himself
an
additional
creditor.
that's
ridiculous.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
it
talks
about
is
inducing
the
client
to
--
to
borrow
money
from
somebody
else
to
pay
the
attorney.
you
know,
and
that
seems
to
be
perfectly
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
would
you
worry
about
the
attorney,
you
know,
hurting
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
no
sense.
