but
there's
already
in
the
statute
an
--
a
required
attestation
from
the
lawyer
who
signs
a
bankruptcy
petition
that
the
petition
does
not
constitute
an
abuse.
this
is
707(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
words
are
something
like
"does
not
constitute
an
abuse".
so
apparently
it
has
meaning
there.
why
doesn't
--
why
don't
we
say,
well,
whatever
it
means
in
707(b),
it
also
means
in
5,
whatever
it
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
words
in
707(b)?
i
mean,
they
are
both
in
the
statute.
what
the
lawyer
has
to
attest
to
is
required
by
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
want
to
--
i
mean,
your
first
point
is
--
and
we
never
get
to
that
question
because
lawyers
shouldn't
be
under
this
act
at
all.
they
shouldn't
be
labelled
debt
relief
agencies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
it
any
different
from
including
lawyers
within
the
category
"debt
collectors",
which
lawyers
objected
to
in
this
court
unsuccessfully?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
in
the
legislative
history
there
were
examples
of
lawyers
overreaching,
that
the
conduct
that
congress
was
aiming
at
was
engaged
in
by
lawyers,
as
well
as
others.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
don't
want
to
be
--
lawyers
don't
want
to
be
called
debt
collectors
either,
and
in
this,
the
fair
debt
collection
act,
it
says
that
--
that
communication
must
say
the
communication
is
from
a
debt
collector,
except
that
formal
pleadings
are
not
--
you
don't
have
to
identify.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
--
that
would
be
a
harder
thing
for
a
lawyer
to
do,
to
identify
herself
in
an
advertisement
as,
i
am
a
debt
collector,
than
i
am
a
debt
relief
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
provision
that
says
the
directors,
employees,
are
not
included?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
an
associate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
some
of
the
examples
that
were
in
the
amicus
brief.
one
of
them
was
the
debtor
is
just
told
by
her
doctor
that
she
has
a
serious
cancer
that
needs
operation
and
radiation,
and
she
is
at
the
end
of
the
line
on
resources.
she
has
her
trade
tools,
which
she
could
sell
to
get
some
money,
but
then
she
won't
be
able
to
carry
on
her
business.
and
she
could
also
borrow
money,
but
incurring
that
debt
--
since
she's
on
the
brink
of
the
bankruptcy,
she's
incurring
the
debt
knowing
that
she's
on
the
brink
of
bankruptcy.
could
the
lawyer
say,
you
don't
have
to
sell
your
--
the
lawyer
could
say:
sell
your
equipment.
that
wouldn't
be
a
problem.
but
could
the
lawyer
say,
incur
the
debt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
take
this
circumstance.
there
is
no
other
--
the
person
is
on
a
brink
of
bankruptcy,
has
no
resources,
can
get
money
by
selling
assets
or
by
borrowing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
she
doesn't
have
a
home
equity
loan.
suppose
she's
a
renter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
thing
that
lawyers
who
render
services
for
money
want
--
is
to
be
sure
that
they
will
get
paid,
and
one
part
of
this
provision,
this
526(a)(4),
talks
about
incurring
debt
to
pay
an
attorney
for
representing
the
debtor.
so
what
can
a
lawyer
say
safely
about
the
lawyer's
getting
paid?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
one
of
the
aspects
of
this
that
makes
it
horrible
is
that
they
are
not
limited
to
saying,
"we
are
debt
relief
agencies;
we
help
people
file
for
bankruptcy.
"
they
can
say
anything
else.
but
there's
no
screening
--
there
is
no
administrator
that
a
law
firm
can
go
to
and
say,
"this
is
what
i
--
this
is
what
i
think
is
substantially
similar.
"
"is
it
okay?
"
