mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
threshold
statutory
question
if
i
may.
i
have
only
a
few
points
on
that.
a
debt
relief
agency
is
any
person
who
provides
specified
services
to
specified
clients
for
pay.
an
attorney
is
a
person,
a
defined
term
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
the
petitioners
have
affirmatively
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
they
provide
bankruptcy
assistance
to
assisted
persons.
we
think
that
is
all
that
is
required
to
determine
that
they
are
debt
relief
agencies
under
the
statute.
mr.
william
m.
jay
as
i
understand
petitioners'
argument
about
that
provision,
it
is
that
congress
would
surely
have
made
an
exception
for
partners
as
well
had
it
intended
to
include
attorneys.
we
think
that
that
is
a
multi-step
chain
of
reasoning
that
breaks
down
at
each
step.
congress
made
an
exception
from
the
definition
of
"debt
relief
agencies"
for
officers
and
employees
of
the
business
that
is
itself
a
debt
relief
agency.
partnerships,
of
course,
have
employees
as
well,
and
a
run-of-the-mill
employee
of
a
partnership
who
doesn't
provided
the
bankruptcy
assistance
services
himself
is
not
himself
a
debt
relief
agency--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
an
associate
is
an
employee,
so
if
the
associate
in
a
law
firm
provides
--
doesn't
provide
the
bankruptcy
assistance
herself,
then
she
is
not
a
debt
relief
agency.
it's
the
--
because
any
person
is
defined
under
the
bankruptcy
code
to
include
individual
partnership
or
corporation.
that
is
section
101(41).
it's
the
law
firm
that
provides
the
services,
is
a
person
who
provides
the
services
and
therefore
a
debt
relief
agency.
i
suppose
an
individual
who
provides
the
services
himself
or
herself
might
be
an
agency,
a
debt
relief
agency,
as
well.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
absence
of
a
specific
exception
for
partners
of
a
partnership
tells
us
anything
that
would
derogate
from
the
plain
meaning
of
the
defined
terms
in
the
statute.
the
fact
that
partners
are
liable
for
actions
of
the
partnership
is
a
commonplace
of
partnership
law.
and
it's
also
not
the
case
that
all
attorneys
practice
in
partnerships.
the
petitioner
law
firm
is
a
professional
corporation
and
one
of
the
individual
petitioners
is
a
director
of
that
--
of
that
professional
corporation.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
i
--
i
am
happy
to
respond
to
it
in
further
detail.
i
think
that
the
--
first,
the
reference
to
appearing
in
a
case
or
proceeding
on
behalf
of
another,
that
can
only
refer
to
lawyers.
even
if
as
you--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--that's
right,
justice
breyer,
and
i
think--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--but
appearing
--
appearing
in
a
case
or
proceeding
under
this
title,
your
honor,
means
entering
an
appearance
in
court.
i
think
that's
--
that's
the
natural
reading
of
that
phrase.
and
petitioners
have
suggested
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
catch
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
but
certainly
neither
the
plain
meaning
nor
the
legislative
record
suggests
that
people
who
are
not
lawyers
were
actually
engaging
in
conduct
so
brazen
as
to
show
up
in
federal
bankruptcy
court,
enter
--
file
a
notice
of
appearance
and
purport
to
be
a
lawyer.
that
is
not
what
this
statute
is
intended
to
catch.
at
any
rate,
the
legislative
history
i
think
amply
supports
our
view.
page
21
of
our
brief
collects
a
number
of
citations
to
the
legislative
record
specifically
referring
to
attorneys.
as
for
the
point
mr.
brunstad
made
about
the
change
in
the
drafting
history
of
this
bill
from
1999.
and
in
the
house
report
accompanying
the
1999
version
of
the
bill,
which
had
changed
from
"debt
relief
counseling
agency"
to
"debt
relief
agency",
the
house
report
said,
"it
applies
to
attorneys,
as
well
as
to
non-attorneys,
such
as
petition
preparers.
"
"that
is
page
120
of
house
report
106-123.
"
so
i
think
that
amply
refutes
the
point
about
the
drafting
history.
but
in
any
event,
if
the
court
were
to
look
at
legislative
history,
we
think
that
the
provisions
of
the
2005
house
report
accompanying
the
bill
that
actually
was
enacted
are
the
most
probative,
and
we've
cited
two
references
on
page
21
of
our
brief
that
we
think
amply
demonstrate
that
attorneys
are
included.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
about
the--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
statute
prohibits
only
advice
to
incur
more
debt
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
william
m.
jay
but
the
lawyer
in
your
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice,
has
not
advised
the
client
to
take
the
trip;
it
has
not
advised
the
client
to
do
that.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
suppose
that,
you
know,
there
might
be
a
fact
question
about
whether
a
particular
wink
and
nod
communication
between
an
attorney
and
client
were
in
fact
advice
to
engage
in
the
transaction,
that's
prohibited
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
fraudulent
or
abusive
transaction.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
if
--
if
that
debtor
reads
our
brief,
that
debtor
will
also
see
that
there
are
serious
consequences
for
the
debtor
himself,
which
is
precisely
why
congress
passed
this
statute
providing
for
relief
for
the
debtor
against
the
attorney
who
provides
this
unethical
or
abusive
advice.
an
attorney
--
sorry.
a
client
who
incurs
additional
debt
intending
to
defraud
the
creditor
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
a
discharge
of
that
debt
and
indeed
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
at
all--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
culver
case,
a
--
a
disciplinary
case
that
we
referred
to
in
our
brief,
is
a
good
illustration
of
this.
fraud
turns
on
the
defrauder's
intent
as
a
--
as
a
general
matter.
and
when
someone--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
advice
to
incur
the
additional
debt.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
--
that
a
debtor
who
read
our
brief
or
who
informed
himself
with
these
hints
that
you're
positing
the
attorney
giving,
i
don't
think
that
the
debtor
would
take
the
step
of
--
of
incurring
the
additional
debt,
precisely
because
there
are
consequences
for
the
debtor,
and
it's
--
it's
a
grave
risk.
that's
precisely
why
congress
prohibited
--
prohibited
this
form
of--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
think,
your
honor,
subject
to
some
kind
of
situations
of
willful
blindness,
that
the
attorney
in
that
situation
would
not
be
read
by
any
factfinder
to
have
advised
a
--
to
have
advised
her
client
to
incur
additional
debt
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy.
and
it
is
--
it
is
that
that
is
the
statutory
touchstone.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
think
the
lawyer
under
a
number
of
circumstances
could
say
incur
the
debt.
precisely--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
if
i
may,
justice
ginsburg,
the
hypothetical
doesn't
state
how
she's
going
to
borrow
the
money.
so
for
example,
if
she
has
an
open
home
equity
line
of
credit
and
she
borrows
against
that
home
equity
line
of
credit,
it's
a
secured
loan
that
is
not
going
to
be
discharged
in
a
chapter
7
proceeding,
i
think
that
that's
unobjectionable
under
our
reading
of
the
statute.
it's
not
--
it's
not
abusive,
because
it's
not
an
abuse
of
the
bankruptcy
system--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
the
two
--
the
two
scenarios
that
our
view
--
that
in
our
view
are
covered
by
the
statute
are
taking
on
debt
in
an
attempt
to
abuse
the
bankruptcy
system
or
to
defraud
the
creditor.
and
even
--
even
someone
without
--
without
a
home
equity
loan,
a
home
equity
line
of
credit,
can
take
on
additional
debt
without
intending
to
defraud
the
creditor
simply
by
--
by
intending
to
repay
it.
and
that
is
illustrated
in
the
culver
case,
in
which
the
attorney
had
advised
the
client
to
take
on
additional
debt,
to
--
indeed,
he
gave
her
a
credit
card
application
and
said,
get
some
more
cash
advances.
and
she
said:
i
don't
want
to
take
on
this
additional
debt.
and
he
said:
don't
worry,
i
will
represent
you
in
bankruptcy;
you
won't
have
to
repay
a
penny
of
it.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
explained
that
that
was
unethical
advice
under
the
rule
1.2(d),
the
model
rule
that
applies
in
just
about
every
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i'm
certainly
not
attempting
to
fight
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical.
i'm
attempting
to
illustrate
that
--
that
the
aspect
of
the
statute
that
prohibits
advice
to
defraud
creditors,
you
know,
will
turn
on,
among
other
things,
whether
there
is
any
intent
to
repay
the
debt.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
think
that
that's
right,
justice
alito,
that
in
that
hypothetical
there
is
no
--
the
mere
--
the
mere
fact
that
the
bankruptcy
may
be
looming,
even
in
the
hypothetical,
is
not
the
animating
cause.
and
the
court
has--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
two
prongs
of
--
of
our
reading
of
the
statute,
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
are
to
abuse
the
bankruptcy
code
or
to
--
or
to
defraud
creditors.
the
fraud
of
course
is
illegal--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--but
precisely
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
definition
of
fraud
turns
on
the
defendant
or
the
fraudulent
actor's
intent,
that's
true
under
present
law,
under
rule
1.2(d)
which
prohibits
all
attorneys
from
counseling
their
clients
to
commit
fraudulent
acts.
mr.
william
m.
jay
or
an
abuse
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
in
mr.
brunstad's
argument,
that
is
something
that
the
attorney
already
must
be
familiar
with
under
section
707(b)
and
must
certify
in
filing
any
chapter
7
bankruptcy
that
in
--
after
the
attorney's
professional
investigation,
that
the
granting
of
relief
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
attorneys
are
--
are
making
that
certification
every
day
when
they
are
filing
for
chapter
7
bankruptcies--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
don't
think
it's
unrelated,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
objective
is
in
many
--
in
some
instances
criminal
and
in
other
instances
it
is
prohibited
by
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
the
reason
that--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
it
is
certainly--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it
is
certainly
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
attorney
is
the
sophisticated
player
here.
it
is
the
attorney
who
is
the
repeat
player,
and
it
is
the
attorney
who,
by
being
made
subject
to
this
statute,
is--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
seeking
punitive
damages
is
not
illegal--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
i
think
that
the
restriction
that
you're
positing
is
that
advice
ever
to
seek
punitive
damages
is
--
is
going
to
be--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
no.
that
would,
of
course,
would
be
outside
the
bankruptcy
context,
and
we
are
relying
in
part
here
on
--
both
on
the
avoidance
doctrine
and
on
the
meaning
that
"in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy"
has
had
for
a
long
time.
but
--
but
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
that,
if
there
is
actually
a
tie
between
--
so
that
sounds
exactly
to
me
like
a
prohibition
saying
to
the
lawyer,
don't
file
complaints
for
punitive
damages
that
aren't
supported
just
under
the
normal
rule
11
standard.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
an
impermissible
attempt
to--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
here,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it's
an
extraneous
objective.
perhaps
i
am
misunderstanding
how
you
--
how
the
court
is
meaning
extraneous.
the
--
here,
the
advice
is
the
motivating
cause
in
some
of
these
instances
of
the
--
of
the
debtor
taking
the
step
that's
going
to
lead
to
actual
harm
to
the
debtor.
that's
why
congress
provided
that
the
remedy
for
a
violation
of
this
is
either
an
injunctive
action
by
a
government
official,
the
u.s.
trustee
or
by
the
court
or
state
attorney
general,
or
actual
damages
paid
to
the
debtor
who
has
suffered
harm
from
the
unethical
or
abuse
of
advice
given
to
him
or
her
by
the
attorney.
so
i
think
that
saying
that
--
that
it's
extraneous
to
the
attorney-client
relationship,
i
think
that's
not
the
statute
that
--
that
congress
enacted
here.
it
enacted
a
statute
that
protects
the
client
from
improper,
unethical,
abusive,
or
even
criminal
--
criminally
fraudulent
advice
by
the
attorney.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
i
would
like
to
note,
if
i
may,
justice
ginsburg,
that
we
don't
think
that
that
is
properly
part
of
this
challenge.
i
will
be
happy
--
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
the
question,
but
the
court
of
appeals
struck
down
this
statute,
and
it
said,
nine
times,
that
it
was
talking
about
the
portion
of
the
statute
referring
to
in
"contemplation
of
bankruptcy".
and
the
"to
pay
an
attorney"
provision
was
not
addressed
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
their
brief
in
opposition
to
our
cert
position,
so
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
it's
properly
here
--
it
hasn't
been
addressed.
but
to
--
to
answer
your
question,
the
statute
says
not
--
and
this
part
of
the
statute
is
on
page
5a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
--
"to
advise
an
assisted
person
to
incur
more
debt
to
pay
an
attorney
or
bankruptcy
petition
preparer.
"
so
advising
the
client
--
you
know,
that
the
client
ought
to
pay
the
fee
--
you
know,
here's
my
bill,
my
fee
is
due
on
day
x,
that
simply
doesn't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
it's
only
to
incur
more
debt
to
pay
the
attorney.
and
the
situation
that
we
think
congress
is
getting
at
is
the
circumstance
where
the
attorney
wants
to
be
paid
up-front,
again,
like
in
the
culver
case,
the
attorney
wants
his
client
to
take
out
a
cash
advance
from
the
credit
card
company,
knowing
--
and
to
give
that
money
to
the
attorney
to
pay
his
fee,
precisely
because
the
debt's
going
to
be
--
the
unsecured
debt
to
the
credit
card
company
is
going
to
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
don't
think
so,
justice
sotomayor,
precisely
because
the
attorney
--
the
attorney
still
hasn't
issued
the
advice
to
incur
more
debt.
i
mean,
the
client,
of
course,
also
has
the
opportunity
--
or
the
option
of
not
paying
the
fee
and
carrying
it
--
carrying
it
forward
into
bankruptcy.
so,
in
any
event,
we
don't
think
that
that
provision
can
--
can
be
the
basis
for
a
holding
that
the
other
provision
about
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy
is
substantially
overbroad,
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
here.
if
i
may,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
on--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--to
incur
more
debt
to
pay
an
attorney,
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
the
import
of
the
statute,
and
that's
because
congress
recognized
that
there
is
an
incentive
for
attorneys
to
put
pressure
on
their
clients
to
--
to
favor
the
attorney
as
creditor,
to,
essentially,
treat
the
attorney
as
a
creditor
in
a
better
position
than
other
creditors.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
in
some
of
the
examples
that
have
come
up
in
the
briefing
in
this
case
--
you
know,
a
refinancing
transaction,
for
example
--
you
know,
or
a
sale
--
sale
of
the
house
and
replacing
it
with
a
rental.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
more
debt.
mr.
william
m.
jay
it's
true
that
the
court
can
authorize--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--precisely
because,
justice
breyer,
different
standards
apply
to
the
--
to
payments
made
to
the
attorney
before
the
bankruptcy
commences
and
payments
made
to
the
attorney
after
the
bankruptcy
commences.
it's
a
--
the
standard
of
scrutiny
after
the
bankruptcy
commences
is
a
--
is
a
bit
more
searching
under
section
330.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
on
section
526,
i
do
want
to
address
section
528,
the
--
the
advertising
disclosure
requirements.
and,
there,
we
think
that,
as
justice
sotomayor
brought
out
in
her
exchange
with
mr.
brunstad,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
pertaining
to
the
particular
advertisements
that
petitioners
want
to
run.
they
simply
say,
on
pages
38
and
39
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
they
have
advertised,
and
they
wish
to
continue
to
advertise.
there
is
no
allegation
about
their
content.
and
they
sought
and
were
granted
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
on
the
theory
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
it's
anything
other
than
a
facial
challenge,
it's
an
as-applied
challenge,
as
applied,
essentially,
to
any
attorney
or,
indeed,
anyone
who
wants
to
run
these
advertisements.
we
think
that,
as
i
understand
the
gravamen
of
petitioners'
argument,
is
that
the
two-sentence
suggested
text
is
incorrect,
that
it's
--
that
it's
misleading
because
it's
wrong.
and
the
basis
for
that
is
saying
that
some
people
who
are
debt
relief
agencies
don't
help
people
file
for
bankruptcy
relief
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--four
points
on
that,
justice
alito.
first,
the
advertisement
can
and
indeed,
i'm
sure
always
will,
say
that
the
advertiser
is
a
lawyer.
nothing
forbids
the
advertisement
from
saying
that.
there
is
no
restriction
on
what
content
goes
in
the
ad,
only
that
it
include
this
is
disclaimer.
second,
the
term
"debt
relief
agency"
is
a
new
one.
it
was
coined
by
congress
in
2005
precisely
because
it
includes
--
it
includes
attorneys;
it
includes
bankruptcy
petition
preparers.
they
had
to
--
you
know,
they
had
to
come
up
with
an
amalgamated
term
that
includes
them
both.
the
fact
that
it's
a
new
term
--
it
came
freighted
with
no
--
no
preceding
--
no
baggage
from
its
preceding
history,
and
indeed,
if
the
statute
were
on
the
books
and
allowed
to
take
affect
once
this
challenge
is
disposed
of,
i
am
confident
that
the
meaning
would
become
much
more
well-accepted.
and
the
petitioners
have
invited
the
court,
and
this
is
on
page
87
of
their
opening
brief,
to
look
at
their
website.
and
of
course
that's
outside
the
record,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
court
looks
at
it,
the
court
will
see
that
petitioners
refer
to
their
bankruptcy
practice
as
providing
debt
relief.
we
think
that's
a
natural
way
of
--
of
pitching
what
the
services
made
available
by
a
bankruptcy
attorney
are:
relief
from
one's
debts.
so
we
don't
think
there
is
anything
wrong
with
that
term.
but
i
do
want
to
turn
back
to
why
it's
not
correct
to
say
that
a
debt
relief
agency
would
ever
not
--
not
help
people
file
for
bankruptcy
relief
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
that
is
because,
as
i
understand
petitioners'
argument,
it's
that
an
assisted
person
might
be
a
creditor.
that
is
not
correct.
the
definition
of
"assisted
person"
turns
on
having
nonexempt
property
in
excess
of
a
certain
amount.
under
section
522(l)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
indeed
under
this
court's
decision
in
owen
v.
owen,
there
is
no
exempt
property
until
there
is
a
filing
for
bankruptcy
and
an
assembly
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
and
a
filing
by
the
debtor,
or
someone
on
the
debtor's
behalf,
filing
schedules
that
specify
what
property
the
debtor
has
and
which
exemptions
the
debtor
chooses
to
claim.
that
is
only
done
when
there
is
a
debtor.
creditors
don't
do
that.
creditors
don't
have
nonexempt
property.
we
don't
think
a
creditor
could
be
an
assisted
person.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
first,
justice
sotomayor,
if,
for
example,
they
do
it
pro
bono,
then
it
wouldn't
--
then
it
wouldn't
trigger
the
definition
at
all.
but
assuming
that
the
brother-in-law
pays
for
the
services,
then
yes.
i
mean,
yes--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--not
ex
post
facto,
justice
sotomayor.
they
would
become
a
debt
relief
agency,
and
thereafter,
advertisements
directed
to
the
public
that
advertise
those
specific
services,
and
if
they
don't
have
a
bankruptcy
practice
at
all,
or
don't
advertise
the
services
that
are
listed
in
section
528,
then
the
disclaimer
requirement
doesn't
apply
at
all.
but
if
they
then
chose--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--that
--
that
may
well
be.
well,
they
may
have
a
website,
justice
scalia,
but
big
firms
have
to
deal
already
with
multifarious
disclaimer
requirements
in
every
state
where
they
practice,
and
firm
websites
often
have
a
lengthy
set
of
disclaimers;
you
know,
one
required
by
texas,
and
one
required
by
new
york,
and
so
on.
this
is
something
that
--
that
multijurisdictional
firms
are
already
familiar
with,
and
they
provide
these
disclaimers
without
problem.
and--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg,
and
there
is
of
course
the
safe
harbor.
by
using
this
two-sentence
statement,
the
advertiser
is
certain
that
there
will
be
no
problem.
but
i
think
that
--
that
a
substantially
--
a
substantially
similar
statement
is
a
permissive
standard,
and
if
there
would
be
any
constitutional
doubt,
it
would
be
to
resolve
it
in
favor
of
flexibility
in
that
regard.
