is
there
a
--
is
there
a
difference
between
unethical
and
illegal
advice?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
an
attorney
can
you
under
--
give
unethical
advice?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
the
state
rules
you
can
give
unethical
advice
as
a
lawyer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
you
are
not
permitted
to
do
so,
what
in
the
first
amendment
would
otherwise
give
you
that
right?
i
mean,
this
is
a
commercial
transaction
of
sorts.
it's
a
fiduciary
duty,
but
it's
a
commercial
transaction.
they
are
coming
to
you
and
they
are
paying
you
for
certain
advice,
so
why
would
the
person
then
protect
your
right
to
give
unethical
advice.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
are
assuming
that
it's
not
read
with
a
limitation
with
respect
to
abusive
conduct.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
that
is
read
into
the
statute
or
is
viewed
as
part
of
"in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy",
what
in
the
first
amendment
would
make
that
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
doesn't
explain
why.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
understand
what
it
means
as
a
lawyer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
before
you
go
on
on
528,
could
you
clarify
for
me:
what
is
your
challenge
to
528?
is
it
a
normal--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--528.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
a
normal
facial
invalidity?
is
it
an
overbreadth
invalidity?
is
it
an
as-applied
challenge?
what
exactly
are
you
claiming
with
respect
to
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--528.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
how
you
have
an
as-applied
challenge
when
i
don't
even
know
what
ad
is
at
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
have
scoured
the
record
for
a
handbill,
meaning
--
an
advertisement--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--by
you
that
i
could
look
at
and
say,
you
know,
i'm
looking
at
it
and
it's
not
misleading.
so
where
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
truly
have
never
heard
of
an
as-applied
challenge
when
we
don't
know
what
it
is
being
applied
to.
but
putting
that
aside,
so
you
have
an
as-applied
challenge;
do
you
have
a
facial
challenge
or
an
overbreadth
challenge?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
the
528.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
the
government
bring
this
lawsuit
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what,
were
they
supposed
to
scour
your
advertisements
to
find
the
violation?
was
that
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you
something?
when
you
are
an
attorney
advertising
as
an
attorney
who
gives
advice
on
bankruptcy,
why
aren't
you
a
debt
release
--
relief
advisor?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
--
that's
the
clear
case.
how
about
the
person
comes
in,
shows
the
attorney
his
or
her
financial
state.
there
is
no
money
to
pay
the
fee.
the
attorney
simply
gives
a
bill
and
says,
"i
need
it
by
friday".
no
self-respecting
person
would
believe
that
the
individual
is
going
to
pay
that
bill
without
borrowing
money
from
somewhere,
if
you
have
looked
at
their
financial
statement
and
there
is
no
money
to
be
had.
would
the
attorney
have
violated
the
statute
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
one.
so,
basically,
your
bottom
line
is
any
advice
to
incur
debt
to
pay
an
attorney
is
illegal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
perhaps
i
am
being
--
not
quite
understanding
you.
you
are
underscoring
the
more
debt,
that
is
going
to
always
be
additional,
if
the
advice
is
to
incur
it.
so
what
meaning
are
you
giving
to
more
that
i
am
missing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
a
law
firm
that
represents
the
biggest
companies
in
the
world?
and
so
they
are
never
going
to
consciously,
intentionally
seek
out
or
represent
a
person
defined
with
the
financial
limitations
of
this
category.
but
it
so
happens
that
one
of
their
very
rich
clients
comes
in
and
says,
i
have
a
small
--
my
brother-in-law
is
running
a
small
business;
help
him
or
her.
is
that
firm
in
violation
now
because
their
advertisements
did
not
include
what
528(a)
required?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
have
to
--
for
this
one
brother-in-law,
they
have
to
amend
--
they're
now
violated
the
statute
ex
post
facto
somehow?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
with
limited
exceptions,
the
bankruptcy
abuse
prevention
and
consumer
protection
act
of
2005
defines
the
term
debt
relief
agency
to
include
any
person
who
provides
bankruptcy
assistance
to
an
assisted
person
for
payment
or
who
is
a
bankruptcy
petition
for
payer.
the
act
imposes
certain
restrictions
on
professionals
who
meet
that
definition.
as
relevant
to
this
litigation,
the
act
prohibits
them
from
advising
clients
to
incur
more
debts
in
contemplation
of
filing
for
bankruptcy,
and
it
requires
them
to
make
certain
disclosures
in
their
advertisement.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
litigation,
a
law
firm
and
others,
to
whom
i
refer
collectively
as
milavetz
filed
a
pre-enforcement
action
seeking
declaratory
relief.
milavetz
contends
that
attorneys
are
not
debt
relief
agencies
under
the
act
and
therefore
are
not
bound
by
its
advice
and
disclosure
rules.
in
the
alternative,
milavetz
argues
that
the
advice
and
disclosure
rules
are
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
attorneys.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
milavetz.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
it
agreed
with
the
government
that
attorneys
are
debt
relief
agencies,
and
that
the
act's
disclosure
requirements
are
valid
as
applied
to
attorneys.
but
it
upheld
the
district
court's
judgment
that
the
advice
restrictions
broadly
prescribed
the
provisions
of
probational
advice
and
thus
run
afoul
of
the
first
amendment.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
circuit
conflict
regarding
the
scope
of
the
advice
provision.
we
first
conclude
that
the
act
defines
debt
relief
agency
to
include
attorneys.
as
the
eighth
circuit
found,
the
bankruptcy
assistance
that
circumscribes
the
relevant
class
of
professionals,
include
several
services
commonly
performed
by
attorneys,
including
some
such
as
the
provision
of
legal
representation
with
respect
to
a
case
of
proceeding,
that
can
be
performed
only
by
attorneys.
we
also
find
it
significant
that
in
enumerating
specific
exceptions
to
the
definition
of
debt
relief
agency,
congress
did
not
list
attorneys.
milavetz
counter
arguments
do
not
persuade
us
to
disregard
the
plain
language
of
the
definition.
next,
we
reject
the
eighth
circuit
broad
reading
of
the
acts
advice
restriction.
11
usc
code
5026
a4
and
conclude
that
it
prohibits
debt
relief
agencies
only
from
advising
a
debtor
to
incur
more
debt
because
the
debtor
is
filing
for
bankruptcy
rather
than
for
a
valid
purpose.
we
have
previously
construed
the
phrase
in
contemplation
of
filing
for
bankruptcy
to
indicate
that
the
expectation
of
filing
induced
or
held
the
conduct
in
question.
accordingly
we
construe
526
a4
to
prohibit
only
implies
that
it
induced
or
compelled
by
the
prospect
of
the
bankruptcy.
in
practice,
such
advice
will
generally
consist
of
encouragement
to
load
up
on
debt
with
the
expectation
of
obtaining
its
discharge.
the
statutory
context
supports
the
conclusion
that
section
526
a4
primarily
targets
this
type
of
conduct.
we
reject
milavetz
arguments
in
favor
of
a
broader
reading
of
the
restriction
as
well
as
its
claim
that
the
provision
as
narrowly
construed
is
impermissibly
vague.
finally,
we
agree
with
the
eighth
circuit
that
the
act’s
disclosure
requirements
codified
in
11
usc
code
section
528
are
valid
as
applied
to
milavetz,
because
those
provisions
are
directed
at
misleading
commercial
speech
and
impose
a
disclosure
requirement
rather
than
affirmative
limitation.
we
conclude
as
we
did
in
zauderer
versus
office
of
disciplinary
counsel
that
the
requirements
need
only
be
reasonably
related
to
the
government's
interest
in
preventing
consumer
deception.
we
find
that
the
challenge
disclosure
requirements
satisfy
that
standard
as
applied
to
milavetz.
for
the
reasons
summarized
here
and
further
elaborated
in
our
opinion.
we
affirm
the
eighth
circuit
judgment
as
to
the
definition
of
debt
relief
agency,
and
the
validity
of
the
act’s
disclosure
provisions,
and
we
reverse
as
to
the
scope
of
the
advice
provision.
the
consolidated
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
