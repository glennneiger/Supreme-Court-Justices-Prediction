but
isn't
there
another
problem?
even
if
congress
didn't
think
of
the
problem,
don't
we
have
the
duty
to
construe
the
statute
to
avoid
constitutional
problems
if
there
is
any
reasonable
basis
for
doing
so?
justice

that
is
an
entirely
different
argument
from
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
think
of
this
problem.
