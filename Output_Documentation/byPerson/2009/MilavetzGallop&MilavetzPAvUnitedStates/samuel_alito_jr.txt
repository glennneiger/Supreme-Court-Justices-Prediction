justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
think
that
means?
what
do
you
think
"in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy"
means?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
say
someone
goes
to
the
lawyer
and
they
discuss
the
person's
debt
situation
and
the
decision
is
made
that
a
bankruptcy
petition
is
going
to
be
filed
at
some
future
date.
and
you
think
that
everything
that
that
person
does
after
that
point
is
done
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then,
why
not?
the
person
drives
home
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy,
the
person
has
lunch
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
it
mean
--
"in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy"
means
because
of
the
expectation
of
filing
a
bankruptcy
petition
later?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
a
law
firm
--
if
a
law
firm
provides
representation
for
debtors
in
bankruptcy,
what
is
misleading
about
requiring
them
to
say:
we
help
people
file
for
bankruptcy
relief
under
the
bankruptcy
code?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
something
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy
done
only
--
isn't
something
done
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy
only
if
it
is
done
because
of
the
anticipation
of
filing
a
bankruptcy
petition?
so
that
if
--
if
a
person
takes
on
additional
debt
in
order
to
obtain
life-saving
treatment,
that
is
not
done
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy;
it's
not
done
because
of
the
bankruptcy.
it's
done
because
there
is
an
emergency
that
requires
immediate
expenditures.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
it
misleading
for
an
attorney
to
say,
i'm
a
--
i'm
a
debt
relief
agency?
nobody
is
going
to
know
what
a
debt
relief
agency
is,
unless
they
are
familiar
with
this
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
perspective
client
looks
at
that,
and
they
say,
well,
i
don't
want
a
debt
relief
agency,
i
want
a
lawyer.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
misleading.
