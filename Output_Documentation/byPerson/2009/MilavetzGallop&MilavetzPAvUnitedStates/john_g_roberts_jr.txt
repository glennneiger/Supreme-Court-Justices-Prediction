justice

g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1119,
milavetz,
gallop
&
milavetz
v.
united
states
and
united
states
v.
milavetz.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
much
of
your
case
depends
upon
the
difficulty
of
defining
what
--
if
you
accept
the
idea
that
"in
contemplation
of"
means
abusive
or
fraudulent,
how
much
of
your
case
depends
upon
the
proposition
that
it's
just
hard
to
tell,
that
it's
--
it's
a
multifactored
inquiry
and
that
the
lawyer
sort
of
has
to
stop
and
think
at
every
turn:
well,
could
this
be
construed
as
recommending
abuse,
or
is
this
just
construed
as
telling
clients
what
they
can
and
can't
do?
and
in
some
areas
it's
a
gray
area,
and
what
should
you
do
when
it's
a
gray
area?
is
that
--
does
your
case
depend
upon
that,
which
is,
i
guess,
just
an
issue
with
the
limiting
construction
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
brunstad.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
--
if
--
if
lawyers
are
debt
relief
agencies,
i
am
curious
how
your
limiting
construction
works.
if
a
client
comes
into
a
lawyer
and
says,
look,
i
know
we
are
thinking
of
filing
bankruptcy,
but
i
want
to
go
to
tahiti
and
charge
it;
can
i
do
it?
and
the
lawyer
says:
oh,
the
law
says
i
can't
give
you
advice
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy;
the
solicitor
general
says
that
means
i
can't
give
you
advice
in
aid
of
fraud
that
would
deprive
debtors
of
assets
they
might
otherwise
get,
so
i
can't
tell
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
has
that
person
violated
--
has
that
lawyer
violated
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
person
has
asked,
can
i
charge
the
trip
to
tahiti?
and
the
lawyer,
although
giving
perfectly
truthful
advice,
has
effectively
conveyed
to
his
client
that
if
he
does
he
would
be
depriving
debtors
of
assets
they
might
otherwise
get.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
has
communicated
to
the
client
that
if
he
takes
the
trip,
one,
he
will
have
a
good
time
in
tahiti;
and
two,
he
will
be
using
assets
that
would
otherwise
end
up
in
the
hands
of
the
debtors.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
the
lawyer
said:
i
can't
give
you
advice
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy,
but
here's
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
read
that.
[laughter]
and
a
reasonable
--
my
point
is
a
reasonable
person
reading
the
brief
would
say,
well,
the
reason
he
can't
give
me
advice
is
because
that
might
cause
me
to
do
something
that
would
defraud
the
debtors,
so
i'm
going
to
buy
the
ticket.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
one
of
the
things
i'm
concerned
about
your
limiting
construction,
"intending
to
defraud
the
debtor".
what
if
the
person
takes
a
trip
to
tahiti
every
november?
they've
always
done
it.
they
are
not
intending
to
defraud
the
debtor.
they
are
just
doing
what
they
have
always
done.
so
an
attorney
that
gives
that
advice,
would
be
--
that
would
be
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
--
so
if
the
lawyer
said
that,
i
can't
give
you
advice
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
fraud
turns
on
the
debtor's
intent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
the
whole
point
is
that
the
attorney
could
be
providing
advice
that
would
steer
the
debtor
away
from
doing
anything
wrong.
and
yet
the
other
--
the
government
would
say,
oh,
no,
no,
no,
no;
you
are
trying
to
tell
him
it's
okay
to
take
the
trip
to
tahiti.
if
he
says
you
can
take
the
trip
to
tahiti
so
long
as
your
intent
is
not
to
defraud
the
debtor
--
correct
advice
that
could
be
read
as
telling
the
debtor
not
to
do
anything
wrong
or
could
be
read
as
giving
the
debtor
a
little,
as
you
say,
a
wink
and
a
nod
and
saying,
you
know,
what
do
you
intend
to
do?
and
he
says,
oh,
i
just
intend
to
go
on
vacation,
not
to
defraud
the
debtors.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
come
up
with
your
own
hypotheticals
that
are
a
lot
easier
from
your
point
of
view,
and
justice
ginsburg
has
been
suggesting
some
that
are
much
more
difficult
because
they
depend
on
particular
facts.
and
under
your
construction
it
seems
to
me
that
a
lawyer
trying
to
give
correct,
legal,
ethical
advice
has
got
to
pause
before
every
sentence
and
think,
oh,
is
this
going
to
be
construed
in
violation
of
subsection
(a)(4)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
point
is
you
don't
know.
of
course
you
can't
give
advice
to
do
something
illegal.
but
i
--
i
would
think
that
some
of
the
questions
have
been
suggesting
that
it's
hard
to
know
whether
it's
illegal.
you
yourself
say
it
depends
on
the
debtor's
intent.
so
if
a
client
came
in
to
me
and
said,
can
i
do
this,
and
it
depends
on
his
intent,
as
a
lawyer
i
would
want
to
say:
it
depends
on
why
you
are
doing
it.
but
if
--
but
that
i
think
could
be
construed
as
being
--
giving
advice
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
a
regulation
of
the
attorney-client
relationship
to
pursue
an
unrelated
substantive
objective.
you
want
to
ensure
that
debtors
don't
do
something
and
you
think,
well,
the
way
--
it's
not
enough
to
tell
debtors,
don't
do
this.
you're
going
to
say:
we
are
going
to
regulate
what
lawyers
tell
them
as
a
way
of
pursuing
an
unrelated
objective.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
objective
is
criminal;
that
doesn't
mean
it
is
not
being
indirectly
enforced
by
interfering
with
the
attorney-client
relationship.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--or
affecting
the
attorney-client
relationship.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
it's
a
good
way
to
enforce
it,
to
tell
people
you
can't
get
legal
advice
about
it.
what
if
a
state
thinks
that
there
are
too
many
punitive
damage
awards,
that
they
are
out
of
control,
and
so
it
passes
a
law
saying
lawyers
may
not
tell
their
clients
that
they
can
get
--
they
can
seek
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
if
it's
done
with
the
purpose
of
fraud,
it
is.
if
you
think,
well,
i'm
really
--
i
really
wasn't
--
it
really
wasn't
malicious
conduct,
i
know
that,
or
whatever
the
standard
is
for
punitive
damages,
then
it's
illegal,
just
like
here
if
you
incur
debt
to
defraud
your
debtors
it's
illegal,
but
if
you
don't
it's
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no,
no,
no.
only
if
it's
--
you
know,
it
says
you
can't
give
that
advice
in
contemplation
of
filing
a
lawsuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
it's
a
difference
between
filing,
because
there
the
lawyer
signs
the
--
signs
the
complaint.
it's
giving
advice
to
the
client.
and
the
--
i
guess
what
i
would
see
as
the
parallel
is
that
it's
an
objective
outside
the
attorney-client
relationship.
it's
not
like
saying,
you
can't
charge
more
than
50
percent
contingent
fee
or
--
or
whatever
--
you
know,
designed
to
regulate
the
client
--
protect
the
client.
it's
--
it's
a
totally
extraneous
objective.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
brunstad,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

morning
in
case
08-1119,
milavetz,
gallop,

state
insurance
