justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i'm
not
sure.
and
getting
back
to
justice
alito's
point,
if
--
if
we
say
that
the
conviction
is
separate
from
the
sentence,
he
can't
challenge
the
conviction
without
being
--
meeting
the
successive
bar,
what
about
the
finding
of
death
eligibility?
why
--
why
can't
that
be
separated
from
the
sentence
just
like
the
earlier
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
followed
from
the
first
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
--
i
want
you
to
get
--
on
the
assessment
of
the
evidence,
i
just
want
to
ask
--
i
probably
should
know
this,
and
you
can
get
back
to
justice
alito's
question
as
well.
under
alabama
procedure,
at
the
sentencing
hearing
both
in
the
first
trial
and
the
second,
is
there
evidence
about
the
aggravating
and
mitigating,
or
do
you
just
look
at
the
evidence
that
was
proven
in
the
guilt
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
new
witnesses,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
clear
to
me
why
death
eligibility
wasn't
a
part
of
the
first
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
--
how
does
the
state's
definition
at
page
17
of
the
red
brief
not
comport
with
the
whole
idea
of
second
or
successive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
that's
not
--
that's
not
something
that
could
have
been
or
was
raised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
the
second
--
i
see
your
light's
on.
if
it's
the
second
time
around,
then
it's
just
barred
by
law
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
are
right,
but
mccleskey
was
pre-aedpa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
answer
under
aedpa
to
justice
scalia's
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
just
found
that
to
be
successive
under
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
case
do
i
read
that
supports
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
had
thought
that
law
of
the
case
issue
preclusion
would
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
old
--
the
former
rule
of
course,
was
that
you
could
bring
writ
after
writ
after
writ.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
it
--
was
mccleskey
the
first
time
that
that
--
that
that
was
foreclosed?
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that
just
--
that
just
incorporated
a
whole
body
of
law
which
was
very
much
like
issue
preclusion,
was
it
not?
