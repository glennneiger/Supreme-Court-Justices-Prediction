mr.
fisher--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
--
you
say
--
you
present
this
argument
that
it
is
a
second
petition
and
you
say
that's
the
only
issue
before
us
and
there
is
no
other
way
that
the
new
proceeding
would
be
cut
off
under
aedpa.
there
was
in
this
case,
in
the
first
--
when
the
--
the
sentence
was
set
--
set
aside,
an
order
by
the
district
judge;
and
it
said:
magwood,
i
want
you
now
to
bring
out
all
conceivable
--
all
conceivable
claims
on
pain
of
forfeiture.
why
doesn't
that
alone
--
this
is
an
order
by
the
court:
i
don't
want
you
to
engage
in
seriatim
litigation;
i
want
you
to
bring
forward
all
conceivable
claims.
and
that
was
an
order
and
it
was
made
on
pain
of
forfeiture.
why
isn't
that
dispositive
of
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
what
he's
bringing
up
now
was
a
conceivable
claim
that
he
could
have
brought
up
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
issue
is
the
same.
the
issue
is
that
he
didn't
qualify
for
the
death
penalty
because
at
the
time
he
committed
this
offense,
there
had
to
be,
in
addition
to
the
eligible
offense,
at
least
one
aggravator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
doesn't
preclusion
result
from
the
court's
order
that
says:
bring
up
all
conceivable
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fisher
--
mr.
fisher,
to
get
--
i
get
your
"second,
it's
a
new
judgment.
"
but
thinking
in
terms
of
what
aedpa
was
attempting
to
do,
we
have
two
claims,
one
after
the
other.
the
second
claim
is
one
that
would
take
away
the
death
penalty
forever,
that
would
be
it,
because
he
said
the
only
sentence
i
can
get
is
life
without
parole.
he
brings
instead,
first,
one
that
doesn't
make
him
--
that
still
leaves
him
exposed
to
the
death
penalty.
so
the
court
has
been
put
upon
twice.
if
he
had
brought
the
first
claim
and
he
is
right
about
that,
he's
not
death
eligible.
instead,
he
brings
a
claim
that
still
leaves
him
death
eligible,
and
the
court
has
been
burdened
twice,
when
easily
he
could
have
brought,
as
the
district
judge
instructed
him
to
do,
everything
the
first
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
mr.
fisher
uses
the
word
"claim"
as
--
differently.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
makes
a
distinction
between
"issue"
and
"claim".
yes,
it's
the
same
issue;
could
have
been
--
the
issue
could
have
been
raised
earlier,
but,
he
says,
it's
not
the
same
claim.
and
the
statute
uses
the
word
"claim".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
point:
suppose
it
was
raised
but
the
court
didn't
decide
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
test,
i
take
it,
is
that
he
must
have
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
question;
that
means
to
raise
it,
to
have
it
aired,
and
to
have
it
decided.
