i'm
sorry.
wouldn't
collateral
estoppel
block
the
relitigation
of
all
sentencing
--
resentencing
issues
that
were
decided
that
were
identical?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
go
back
to
justice
--
to
the
chief
justice's
example
to
you
at
the
very
beginning
of
your
argument?
justice

sotomayor
to
the
chief
justice's
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
an
order
to
resentence,
to
reduce
a
sentence
from
10
to
8
years.
the
prior
sentence
was
vacated.
there
is
a
new
proceeding,
a
new
booker
type
35538
proceeding
where
the
judge
is
thinking
about
everything,
and
he
says
i
am
going
to
reduce
it
from
10
to
8
years.
i
am
leaving
everything
else
the
same,
because
there
was
no
arguments
about
it;
there
is
no
anything
about
it.
does
your
rule
then
mean
that
that
petitioner
can
come
back
and
say,
my
fine
was
wrong,
my
supervised
release
was
wrong,
other
convictions,
other
sentences
that
were
consecutive
or
concurrent
are
wrong?
