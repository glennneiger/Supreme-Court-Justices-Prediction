then
--
then
you
get
to
--
you
get
to
justice
alito's
question,
because
in
fact
what
we
have
here
is
we
have
piece
of
paper
issued
in
1981,
and
on
that
piece
of
paper
it
says:
you,
billy
joe
magwood,
are
guilty
and
sentenced
to
death
by
electrocution.
then
we
have
another
piece
of
paper
which
was
issued
in
1986,
and
that
says:
you
are
ordered
and
adjudged
guilty
of
the
offense
of
aggravated
murder
and
sentenced
to
death
by
electrocution.
so
the
words
are
identical.
and
one
was
issued
in
'81
and
one
was
issued
in
'86.
so
you
are
saying
since
'86
--
this
piece
of
paper
in
'86
is
a
new
judgment,
you
can
start
all
over.
so
then
the
question
comes
up,
well,
if
you
can
start
all
over
in
respect
to
anything,
why
can't
you
start
all
over
in
respect
to
everything?
but
you
recognize
that
that
would
be
a
mess,
because
all
the
things
that
were
never
challenged
here,
like
those
things
related
to
guilt,
they
could
all
come
up
again,
too,
even
though
he
has
never
done
it.
so
what
is
--
what
is
--
what
is
your
answer?
clearly
you
are
going
to
start
saying
some
things
if
it
wasn't
at
issue
you
can
bring
up,
and
others
you
can't;
and
once
you
are
down
that
track,
how
do
we
know
whether
these
are
on
one
side
or
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
something
new
in
respect
to
the
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
something
new
in
respect
to
the
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah
!
but
it
is
not
new
in
respect
to
the
words.
they
are
identical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
happened--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
sentence
was
reimposed.
so
why
not
those
things?
does
your
concession
on
the
first
part,
which
i
agree
is
necessary,
imply
a
concession
on
the
second
part,
that
it's
not
new
in
respect
to
what
might
have
been
brought
up
before?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
think
what
you
would
have
to
do
--
it's
a
dilemma
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
would
have
to
say
to
follow
his
approach,
is
you
would
say:
judge,
here
is
what
you
would
do.
they're
filing
it
from
the
second
judgment.
okay?
so
it
is
not
second
or
successive.
but
wait.
if
there
is
a
first
judgment
that
says
the
same
thing,
then
it
is,
in
effect,
the
first
judgment
that
counts.
now,
what
happens
when
there
is
a
change?
well,
to
note
the
scope
of
the
change,
you
would
go
to
the
habeas
court
and
you
would
say,
to
the
extent
that
that
habeas
court
changed
--
reversed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
left
open
or
told
the
lower
court:
do
this
over;
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
new
judgment.
and
that
--
that
would
get
them
where
they
want
to
go.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait.
wait
right
there.
i
would
have
read
that
to
say
that
what
he
said
was:
vacate
the
sentencing
part.
now,
you
say:
well,
vacate
the
sentencing
part;
fine.
now
we
look
at
the
second
judgment,
and
we
say:
it's
a
new
judgment.
oh,
but
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
insofar
as
that
habeas
didn't
tinker
with
it.
but
they
did
tinker
with
it,
because
they
vacated
the
sentencing
part.
now,
why
doesn't
that
work?
and
his
argument
is,
that
works
much
easier
for
the
judges,
much
easier
for
everybody,
than
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
a
claim
could
have
or
couldn't
have
been
raised,
whether
a
sentence
was
changed
from
six
years
to
five
years,
or
who
knows
what
we
are
going
to
get
into;
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
argument
--
i
am
making
it
up,
but
i
mean,
he
doesn't
have
to
apply
these
arguments
--
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
against
this
is:
what
you
are
proposing
is
too
complicated.
there
are
thousands
of
these
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
all
you
would
like
is
you
would
like
the
court
of
appeals
to
look
back
and
say:
what
part
of
the
original
sentence
did
the
district
court,
habeas,
vacate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
look
into
the
reasons
for
it,
et
cetera.
because
once
we
start
going
into
the
reasons
for
it,
the
litigation
is
just
going
to
mushroom.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and,
you
know,
you
have
this
new
witness
but
not
that
new
witness,
et
cetera.
so
his
argument
is
one
from
simplicity.
start
with
the
judgment.
second,
keep
it
the
same
insofar
as
the
district
court
didn't
vacate
it.
and
deal
with
it
as
a
new
judgment,
which
it
is,
insofar
as
they
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
they
raised
--
your
view
is
a
simple
rule,
no
matter
how
many
judgments
there
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
this
claim
could
have
been
raised
and
would
have
been
fully
adjudicated
had
it
been,
it's
barred.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
either
it
couldn't
have
been
raised,
or
if
it
could
have
been
raised
and
wouldn't
have
been
fully
adjudicated
or
was
not
fully
adjudicated,
not
barred.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
applied
to
everything.
can
we
reconcile
that
with
the
language?
does
it
work
in
terms
of
the
language?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
judgment.
never
come
up
on
appeal.
yes,
it
did,
the
first
one.
and
let's
see.
there
were
15
issues
that
were
raised.
they
only
answered
--
you
know,
they
answered
one.
now
we
go
back
and
then
five
years
later
he
wants
to
bring
up
a
different
one.
fine.
you
can
do
it.
not
second
or
successive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
--
it's
there
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
one
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
makes
five
claims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
district
court
doesn't
decide,
for
some
reason,
i
don't
know,
number
3
or
4.
maybe
i
--
maybe
it's
not
realistic,
what
i
say.
let
me
think
about
it
some
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
full
--
see,
he
filed
his
petition
--
this
would
get
rid
of
--
i
think
there
are
--
i
am
worried
about
that
there
are
cases
out
there
that
say
the
opposite.
but
we
get
rid
of
all
those
cases,
if
there
are
any,
and
you
just
say
that
he
has
not
had
the
full
opportunity
to
have
the
litigation
on
a
claim
that
he
did
raise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
if
he
couldn't
have
raised
it,
it
doesn't
matter
if
there
was
one
judgment
forever.
he
can
raise
it
again
and
again,
as
long
as
he
only
does
each
one
once,
and
they
are
not
second
or
successive
even
if
they
appear
in
petitions
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
and
7.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
if
in
the
first
trial,
the
lawyer
thinks,
you
know,
i
have
two
claims
here;
one
is
mediocre
and
one
is
great.
and
i'm
not
going
to
win
in
the
court
of
appeals
unless
i
make
the
great
one;
just
forget
about
the
mediocre.
and
he
brings
it
and
he
wins.
okay?
now
he
goes
back.
now
can
he
make
the
mediocre
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
better
put
in
everything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
he
puts
in
everything
and
they
don't
reach
the
other
ones,
he's
okay,
because
he
can
raise
it
again.
