justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
2244
doesn't
make
any
reference
to
judgment,
2244(b).
and
now
you
bring
in
the
concept
of
a
judgment
by
looking
at
another
provision.
but
if
8
of
your
brief
can
be
correct;
namely,
that
when
a
prisoner
such
as
petitioner
obtains
habeas
relief
from
his
sentence
but
not
his
conviction,
any
habeas
petition
after
his
resentencing
that
challenged
his
conviction
would
be
successive.
you
suggest
that
there
are
two
judgments;
there
is
a
judgment
of
sentence
and
there
is
a
judgment
of
conviction.
but
for
habeas
purposes,
the
only
thing
that
is
relevant
is
the
judgment
pursuant
to
which
the
petitioner
is
held
in
custody.
and
that
is
the
judgment
--
that
is
the
sentence.
so
i
--
i
--
if
your
argument
is
correct
that
you
look
to
whether
there's
a
second
or
successive
application
as
to
a
judgment,
then
the
point
you
make
in
footnote
8
just
cannot
be
true.
so
that
if
petitioner
gets
sentencing
relief,
gets
resentenced,
in
the
second
petition
the
petitioner
can
challenge
the
conviction.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
a
--
if
someone
has
a
--
a
judgment
of
conviction,
but
is
no
longer
in
custody,
that
--
that
person
cannot
bring
habeas
petition,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it
--
it
is
the
judgment
pursuant
to
which
the
person
then
is
held
in
custody
to
which
the
habeas
petition
goes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
want
to
belabor--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
don't
want
to
belabor
this
point,
but
once
you
get
beyond
the
formal
argument
that
you
just
look
to
whether
it's
a
new
judgment
--
if
you
--
if
you
take
a
step
beyond
that,
and
if
you
--
if
you
don't
take
a
step
beyond
that,
then
footnote
8
is
wrong.
if
you
take
a
step
beyond
that,
then
there
--
then
there
isn't
a
textual
basis
for
drawing
this
distinction
between
the
sentence
and
the
conviction.
and
what
you
need
to
ask
is
what
is
consistent
with
the
scheme
of
that;
isn't
that
right?
