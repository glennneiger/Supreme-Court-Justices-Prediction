justice
clarence
thomas
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
number
09-158,
magwood
versus
patterson.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitioner
magwood
murdered
a
sheriff
and
was
sentenced
to
death
in
1981.
the
state
courts
denied
relief,
but
the
federal
district
court
granted
a
conditional
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
ground
that
state
trial
failed
to
consider
magwood's
metal
problems
when
sentencing
him
to
death.
the
state
trial
court
held
a
complete
and
new
sentencing
hearing,
took
magwood's
mental
problems
into
account
and
entered
a
new
death
sentence
in
1986.
the
alabama
courts
denied
relief
from
the
new
sentence,
but
the
district
court
granted
another
conditional
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
this
time
the
district
court
found
that
the
alabama
law
at
the
time
of
magwood's
crime
did
not
provide
them
with
fair
warning
that
the
crime
made
him
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
the
state
appealed,
arguing
that
magwood's
fair
warning
claim
should
have
been
dismissed
under
28
u.s.c.,
section
2244(b),
a
provision
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
that
restricts
review
of
claims
presented
in
second
or
successive
habeas
applications.
agreeing
with
the
state,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
decision
granting
relief
on
the
fair
warning
claim.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
magwood
presented
his
fair
warning
claim
in
his
first
application
challenging
his
new
death
sentence.
and
a
first
application
challenging
a
new
judgment
cannot
be
second
or
successive
under
section
2244(b).
accordingly
for
the
reasons
more
fully
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
stevens
and
sotomayor
join.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
ginsburg
and
alito
join.
