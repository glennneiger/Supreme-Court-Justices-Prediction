mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
habeas
petition
challenging
a
new
state
court
judgment
for
the
first
time
cannot
be
a
second
or
successive
petition.
aedpa,
of
course,
is
a
highly
complex
statutory
system
that
has
many
interdependent
parts.
the
pivotal
language
of
this
case,
section
2244,
is
reproduced
at
page
2
of
the
blue
brief,
of
petitioner's
brief.
what
that
section
does
is
it
restricts
claims
that
can
be
brought
in,
quote,
"a
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
application.
"
under
section
2254.
so
this
text
establishes
a
two-step
framework.
first,
the
court
needs
to
decide
whether
it's
dealing
with
a
second
or
successive
petition.
and
second,
if
it
is
and
only
if
it
is,
then
the
court
applies
the
modified
res
judicata
principles
set
forth
in
that
section.
now,
this
case
involves
only
the
first
of
those
two
steps.
and
a
petition,
as
here,
that
challenges
a
new
death
sentence
cannot
be
a
second
or
successive
petition
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
it
challenges
a
state
court
judgment
that
has
no
--
never
been
covered
in
a
habeas
petition
before.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but,
justice
alito,
let
me
make
clear
how
we
get
to
incorporating
judgment
and
then
answer
your
question.
the
way
that
you
incorporate
the
word
2244>
["].
and
section
2244
defines
--
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
of
page
2--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--defines
it
as
"seeking
relief
from
a
state
court
judgment.
"
now,
you
are
right
that
--
that
--
that
if
somebody
receives
relief
only
as
to
their
sentence
and
gets
a
new
death
sentence,
as
in
this
case,
that
the
judgment
he
is
challenging
is
new
only
as
to
the
sentence.
now,
there
--
the
word
u.s.
code.
there
is
two
other
places
i
am
aware
of
where
this
court
had
to
construe
the
word
"judgment".
one
of
them
is
when
this
--
is
with
respect
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
final
state
court
judgments.
and
in
that
realm
--
this
is
in
brady
v.
maryland
in
footnote
1
it's
laid
out.
in
that
realm,
this
court
treats
the
judgment
as
having
two
parts
that
can
be
final--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
and
in
burton
this
court
made
it
very
clear
that
the
judgment
that
he's
being
held
in
custody
as
to
is
the
new
judgment
that
he
is
challenging.
now,
what
i'm
saying
is
in
the
brady
context
this
court
has
treated
judgment
as
having
two
parts
that
can
be
final
as
to
one
and
not
as
to
the
other.
in
other
contexts
in
burton,
for
purposes
of
seeking
an
appeal
or
seeking
habeas
relief,
it
is
treated
as
inseparable.
and
the
common
thread
between
those
two
circumstances
has
been
what
minimizes
federal
intrusion
on
state
affairs?
and
so
in
this
context
that's
a
very
easy
answer,
because
what
this
court
always
assumed,
and
correctly
so,
i
believe,
is
that
if
the
only
thing
that
is
unconstitutional
is
somebody's
sentence,
that's
the
only
thing
a
federal
court
has
the
power
to
invalidate.
and
that's
the
only
thing--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
question
could
actually
arise
in
a
section
2254
case,
where
the
only
thing
a
federal
court
has
power
to
do
is
to
declare
one
way
or
the
other
whether
the
sentence
is
constitutional
or
not
and
then
leave
it
to
the
state
to
decide
in
further
proceedings
how
to
--
how
to
go
forward.
in
the
federal
context
in
section
2255,
the
question
you
suggest
might
arise,
and
indeed
it
has
in
a
few
places.
and
the
question
that
the
federal
courts
have
asked
themselves
in
the
second
habeas
petition,
the
second
in
time
habeas
petition,
is
the
--
is
the
petitioner
challenging
something
he
lost
on
the
first
time?
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
then
it's
a
successive
petition.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
he's
challenging--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
justice
alito.
i
think
there
are
two
textual
bases.
the
first
is
the
word
"judgment"
and,
as
i've
described,
sometimes
this
court
treats
the
judgment
as
having
two
parts
that
can
be
divided,
and
sometimes
it
doesn't.
i
think
in
this
context
it
ought
to
treat
them
as
able
to
be
divided.
the
other
place
you
look
is
the
words
"second"--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
certainly
it
has--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--he
is
being
held
in
custody
until
he
is
executed,
certainly,
under
his
conviction.
but
his
death
sentence
--
and
in
habeas
--
in
habeas
it's
always
been
understood
you
can
challenge
not
just
the
fact
of
your
custody,
but
the
terms
under
which
your
custody--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--so
i
think
the
death
sentence
here
is
most
easily
thought
of
as
the
terms
of
the
custody,
which
is
a
separate
thing
that
he
challenged
and
won
on
the
first
time
and
is
challenging
again
now.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
that
because
--
what
we're
we
are
really
talking
about
here
when
we
talk
about
death
eligibility
is
the
need
to
find
an
aggravating
circumstance.
and
here
that
goes
only
to
whether
--
his
penalty,
what
his
penalty
can
be.
it's
only
to
whether
he
can
receive
the
death
sentence
or
not.
so
it
goes
solely
to
punishment,
not
to
crime.
now,
justice
alito,
on--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
first
conviction
enabled
him
--
if
we
put
aside
for
the
moment
our
substantive
fight
over
whether
or
not
the
crime
itself
constitutes
an
aggravating
circumstance,
but
the
conviction
itself
carries
a
life
sentence
unless
an
aggravating
circumstance
is
found.
and
so
put
--
put
it
this
way,
justice
kennedy:
after
the
eleventh
circuit
granted
habeas
relief
the
first
time,
mr.
magwood
at
that
moment,
in
1986,
was
subject
to
a
conviction
that
carried
a
life
sentence.
and
it
was
the
state
that
elected
to
go
forward
at
that
point
and
to
seek
a
new
death
sentence.
and
all
our
position
is,
is
that
when
that
brandnew
full-blown
sentencing
hearing
was
held
--
and
the
alabama
trial
court
at
pet
app.
103a
called
this
a
"complete
and
new
assessment
of
the
evidence
and
the
law.
"
--when
this
new
hearing
was
held
it
had
to
comport
with
the
constitution.
i
don't
think
even
the
state
disputes
that
all
the
--
all
parts
of
the
constitution
applied
in
that
context.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--because
that
order
was
entered
in
one
case,
and
now
we
have
an
entirely
different
case,
justice
ginsburg.
that
order
was
entered
in
the
case
under
which
mr.
magwood
challenged
his
1981
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
it's
not
--
it
was
not
claim
he
could
have
brought,
and
this
is
an
important
point,
justice
ginsburg.
under
res
judicata
law,
he
is
not
making,
as
the
state
would
say,
the
same
claim
now
as
he
could
have
made
then.
the
fact
that
he
is
challenging
a
different
judgment
by
definition
makes
it
a
new--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
the
legal
--
the
legal
issue
that
he
is
raising
is
one
that
he
could
have
raised
then.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
because
you
can't
waive
something
by
failing
to
raise
it
in
a
different
case.
this
is
an
entirely
different
case,
in
the
district
court--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--so
let
me
answer
that
in
practical
terms
and
then
get
back
to
justice
alito
by
giving
a
--
giving
statutory
hook
for
it.
in
practical
terms,
even
though
the
new
judgment,
which
is
at
pet.
app.
106a,
reimposes
the
conviction,
it's
not
anything
new
as
to
that
conviction.
if
it
were
a
new
judgment
as
to
that
conviction,
the
state
of
alabama
would
have
to
have
a
whole
new
trial
on
guilt/innocence,
and
it
didn't.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
is
new
because
of
the
brandnew
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--they
imposed--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
it
doesn't.
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
lawlor.
this
is
discussed
in
our
opening
brief,
i
believe
around
page
23,
and
it's
a
res
judicata
case.
and
what
the
court
held
in
that
case
is
if
somebody
does
something
to
somebody,
the
exact
same
thing
multiple
times,
you
can
bring
a
new
case
when
they
do
it
to
you
the
second
time
or
the
third
time,
and
you
can
make
arguments
that
were
never
made
the
first
time.
there
is
no
waiver,
there
is
no
forfeiture,
and
the
reason
you
can
do
it
is
you
are
challenging
a
new
injury.
so
mr.
magwood
under
--
even
under
res
judicata
law,
which
this
court
has
said
is
stricter
than
habeas
law,
even
under
res
judicata
law
he
would
have
the
right
to
bring
this
claim
as
to
the
sentence
because
it's
challenging
something
new.
now
let
me
get
back
to
the
statute,
because
this
is
important.
the
other
place
that
we
get
our
--
our
answer
is
the
word--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--with
all
due
respect,
i
think
lawlor
does
apply.
one
example
in
that
case
is
an
abatable
nuisance.
imagine
that
smoke
goes
over
and
pollutes
somebody's
property
every
--
every
first
day
of
january
every
year.
somebody
brings
a
lawsuit
about
that
saying
it
violates
certain
laws,
and
they
lose.
if
the
next
year
smoke
goes
over
the
property
again,
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit
for
the
identical
thing.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
fair
enough.
well,
same
--
same
here.
the
first
case
mr.
magwood
brought
was
about
the
1981
judgment
sentencing
him
to
death,
and
this
case
is
about
the
1986.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
remember,
the
act--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
all
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
the
same
act.
the
same
act
as
to
the
conviction
carries
over,
but
this
was,
as
the
trial
court
put
it,
a
complete
and
new
assessment
of
the
evidence.
this
second--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
the
trial
judge--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--as
it
turns
out,
the
parties
did
not
put
new
witnesses
on
the
stand.
but
the
trial
judge
was
explicit
--
and
this
is
in
the
--
in
the
order
that's
in
the
back
of
the
appendix
--
it
was
explicit
that
the
parties
had
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
they
had
every
right--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--because
death
eligibility
hinges
on
the
finding
of
an
aggravating
circumstance.
and
so
that
was
vacated
when
the
--
when
the
--
when
the
state
elected
to
go
forward
and
tried
to
reimpose
a
death
sentence
and
the
--
reimpose
a
new
death
sentence
and
the
trial
judge
found
new
--
it
turned
out
to
be
the
same
aggravating
circumstance,
but
it
found
an
aggravating
circumstance
all
over
again.
imagine,
justice
kennedy,
the
state
if
it
had
wanted
to
at
the
second
death
sentence
hearing
could
have
submitted
evidence
to
try
to
prove
a
new
aggravating
circumstance.
the
defendants
could
have
submitted
evidence
trying
to
prove
new
mitigating
circumstances.
now,
mr.
--
justice
alito,
i
think
it's
important
to
get
back
to
your
question
for
the
second
actual
hook
for
my
argument,
and
it's
the
words
"second
or
successive".
it
has
to
--
in
some
way
to
make
any
sense
of
the
statute,
you
have
to
say
it's
second
or
successive
as
to
something.
now,
if
you
look
at
mccleskey,
which
is
this
court's
most
thorough
consideration
of
that
concept,
it
says
again
and
again
in
that
decision
what
makes
it
second
or
successive
is
that
you
are
asking
for
the
same
thing
you
have
been
denied
before.
you
are
coming
back,
as
--
as
--
as
it
used
to
be
the
case,
you
are
filing,
in
effect,
an
appeal,
endless
appeals
from
the
denials
that
you
have
been
getting.
we
are
giving
meaning
to
"second
or
successive"
by
saying
that
it's
second
or
successive
if
you
are
asking
for
relief
that
has
been
denied
before.
it
is
not
second
or
successive
if
it's
the
first
time
you
are
challenging
something
new
that
the
state's
imposed.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
going
to
tell
you
two
things.
first
of
all,
with
--
with
respect
to
the
two
different
claims,
given
the
severity
of
mr.
magwood's
mental
illness,
i
think
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
that
prevailing
on
that
claim
in
the
eleventh
circuit
would
have
put
an
end
to
the
state's
decision
to
seek
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
as
it
turns
out,
it
didn't
and
the
state
went
forward.
but
also
understand
that
the
state's
argument
here,
to
the
extent
you
are
ordering
the
claims
in
sort
of
a
level
of
importance,
would
apply
even
if
the
opposite
were
true,
even
if
mr.
magwood
had
brought
the
--
had
brought
some
other
claim
the
first
time
and
prevailed
on
it.
any
claim,
the
state
says,
that
you
could
have
raised
the
first
time
is
forever
barred.
and
that
gets
to,
well,
i
still
don't
think
i
have
quite
answered
the
question
on
second
or
successive,
so
let
me
continue
that.
we
are
giving
meaning
to
that
term
"second
or
successive".
it's
important
to
understand
that,
whatever
slight
difficulty
you
have
with
the
word
"judgment"
and
making
sense
of
the
words
"second
or
successive"
in
our
case
are
dwarfed
by
the
interpretive
difficulties,
in
fact
the
impossibilities,
with
respect
to
the
state's
proposal.
the
state's
proposal
--
and
it's
laid
out
at
page
17
of
its
brief,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
right
after
the
number
1
--
the
state's
proposed
rule
--
and
i
think
it's
useful
to
put
it
next
to
the
statute.
the
state's
proposed
rule
is
if
a
claim
could
have
been
or
was
raised
in
a
prior
petition,
it
is
barred
by
section
2244
(2)
or
(1).
now,
the
first
thing
you
will
notice
is
that
the
words
"second
or
successive"
appear
nowhere
in
the
state's
rule.
the
state
gives
no
definition,
no
meaning
whatsoever,
to
those
concepts.
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
is
--
is
ask
this
court
to
create
a
brandnew
waiver
system,
a
brandnew
waiver
system
for
all
second
in
time
petitions.
and
we
know
--
we
know
from
martinez-villareal
and
slack
and
other
cases
that
second
in
time
petitions
are
not
necessarily
successive
and
certainly
they
ought
not
to
be
thought
of
as
successive
when
they
challenge
a
different
judgment
or
a
different
conviction
or
the
like.
but
what
the
state
is
asking
for
is
a
brandnew
waiver
system
that
has
never
been
imposed
in
any
decision
from
this
court
and
there
have
been
three
decisions
from
this
court
where
it
would
have
come
up.
one
is
burton,
another
is
richmond,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
the
third
case
is--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--because
the
only
way
to
get
the
idea
of
second
or
successive
into
the
state's
definition
is
where
it
says
prior
habeas
petition.
so,
the
only
way
that
a
state
can
even
be
pretending
to
give
meaning
to
that
would
be
a
second
in
time
petition.
now,
we
know
that
can't
be
enough
because
of
slack
and
martinez-villareal.
but
even
more
than
that,
we
know
that
can't
be
enough
because
it
would
--
it
would
prohibit
defendants
from
bringing
second
habeas
petitions
even
as
to
things
that
are
novel
as
to
--
a
second
in
time
rule
would
apply
section
2244's
rules
to
even
second
in
time
petitions
that
are
brandnew
things
that
arose
at
the
retrial
or
resentencing.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
so
the
state
creates
additional
statutory
language
that
doesn't
exist.
it
could
have
been
or
a
previously
available
rule.
let
me
give
you
some--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
you
do
look
at
those
questions
once
it
has
been
determined
that
a
petition
is
second
or
successive.
you
have
never
looked
at
those
questions
in
order
to
determine
somehow
whether
it
gets
in
the
door.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
can
tell
you
lots
of
reasons
why
that
would
be
the
case.
so,
let
me
give
you
some
examples.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
word--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--because
the
word
the
statute
used,
justice
scalia,
is
"claim",
not
issue.
and
this
is
not
the
same
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
lawlor
tells
you
that,
and
res
judicata.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
it
refers
to
section
2254,
and
section
2254
uses
the
word
"judgment",
so
it's
our
belief
it
is
by
incorporation.
but
to
get
back
to
your
precise
question,
it's
important
because
the
statute
does
not
use
the
words
"issue"
or
"argument".
it
uses
the
word
"claim",
which
is
a
defined
term
in
legal
parlance.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but,
justice
scalia,
this
is
not
the
second
time
this
claim
could
have
been
presented.
in
1983
or
'84
when
he
filed
his
first
habeas
petition,
he
couldn't
make
this
claim
because
this
judgment
didn't
even
exist.
there
would
be
no
way
to
challenge
this
judgment.
and
i'm
not
being
overly
technical
here.
i
just
urge
you
to
look
at
res
judicata
law.
now
let
me
give
you
some
examples
of
the
difficulties
the
state
system
would
raise.
first
of
all,
with
--
with
respect
to
intervening
authority.
the
state
itself
concedes
in
its
brief
that
it's
not
clear
how
its
system
would
apply
in
the
case
of
somebody
who
gets
habeas
relief
and
then
later
wants
to
seek
habeas
relief
based
on
an
intervening
decision
of
this
court.
up
until
now
that
has
been
a
perfectly
easy
situation
because
the
new
judgment
allows
a
new
claim
to
be
brought,
but
under
the
state's
rule
it's
unclear.
to
the
extent
that
the
state
says,
well,
what
we
would
have
to
do
is
look
and
see
--
look
and
see
whether
if
there
was
fair
notice
of
that
decision,
the
defendant
would
have
raised
it.
that
gets
into
very
difficult
situations
about
how
new
is
the
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
that's
not
the
state's
rule,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
very
easy
to
say
whether
this
court
has
made
a
decision
retroactive.
it
would
be.
it
hasn't
happened,
but
i
imagine
it
would
be
very
easy.
the
state's
rule
is
any
new
decision
from
this
court
gives
the
defendant
a
new
--
gives
potential
rise
to
a
debate
as
to
whether
or
not
that
claim
was
previously
available.
let
me
tick
off
a
couple
of
other
things
before
i
sit
down.
what
about
a
situation
the
first
time
where
a
claim
is
teague-barred
or
procedurally
precluded
or
maybe
even
the
defendant
doesn't
raise
it
because
under
the
facts
that
the
first
trial
went
forward,
it
would
have
been
harmless
error.
all
of
those
situations
would
raise
very
difficult
questions
as
to
whether
that
claim,
as
the
state
would
put
it,
was
previously
available.
even,
again,
go
back
to
the
idea
of
having
a
new
trial
based
on
new
--
based
on
new
facts
and
new
evidence.
trying
to
figure
out
whether
it's
the
same
claim,
a
different
claim;
imagine
a
claim
based
on
a
prosecutor's
closing
argument.
well,
unless
the
prosecutor
reads
the
exact
same
script
a
second
time,
there
is
going
to
be
a
huge
fight
over
whether
it's
a
new
claim,
an
old
claim,
a
different
claim.
and
finally,
the
state's
other
--
the
other
prong
of
the
state's
test
is
about
claims
that
were
raised
before
are
now
barred.
now,
the
state
immediately
recognizes
that
that's
a
huge
problem
because
it
would
bar
defendants
from
making
--
from
seeking
habeas
relief
if
the
state
made
the
same
violation
the
second
time
around.
so
it
invents
a
brand-new
due
process
principle
that
has
never
been
held
to
be
--
to
be
in
existence
by
this
court.
and
indeed,
in
the
penry
case,
where
this
court
dealt
with
the
texas
situation,
where
the
state
court
made
the
same
error
twice,
it
went
straight
to
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
it
--
well,
it
shouldn't
be
barred.
because
it's
a
new
judgment,
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
get
relief
the
second
time
around.
it
would
be
a
very
strange
construction
of
the
habeas
statute,
and
it
wouldn't
be
law
of
the
case
because
it
would
be
a
new
case,
again,
justice
kennedy.
and
finally,
let
me
give
you
the
situation
of
claims
the
defendant
raises
but
then
loses
on
but
is
unable
to
appeal.
imagine
a
case
like
this
where
the
defendant
has
many
other
claims
that
he
loses
on
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
state
has
a
pickle
here.
it
has
to
either
say
that
those
claims
are
forever
barred
from
being
raised
again,
even
though
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
a
full
right
to
appeal
because
he
won
on
something
else
and
couldn't
appeal
the
losses
on
the
other
issues,
or
the
state
has
to
say
that
those
were
--
that
those
were
not
previously
available,
those
claims
were
not
previously
available,
in
which
all
of
its
rhetoric
about
resurrecting
past
claims
drops
away.
again,
a
very
difficult
question
that
this
court's
going
to
have
to
grapple
with
if
it
accepts
the
state's
rule.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have
left.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
let
me
make
two
points,
your
honor.
if
i
leave
you
with
nothing
else,
think
about
the
argument
that
you
just
heard
that
again
and
again
talks
about
abuse
of
the
writ,
abuse
of
the
writ,
abuse
of
the
writ.
well,
there
is
now
a
statute
that
occupies
this
field,
it's
section
2254.
and
abuse
of
the
writ
principles
apply
only
if
a
petition
is
second
or
successive.
so
if
this
court
does
nothing
else,
it
has
to
define
that
term,
and
we
are
the
only
ones
who
have
given
you
a
definition
of
second
or
successive.
and
congress
made
that
decision
for
a
reason.
it
thought
it
was
fair
to
impose
strict
burdens
on
relitigation
to
the
extent
that
the
defendant
lost.
but
when
he
wins,
and
gets
a
brand-new
trial
or
a
brand-new
sentencing
hearing--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
probably
not.
but
let
me
tell
you,
justice
sotomayor,
that
question
can
arise
only
in
a
federal
situation.
it
cannot
arise
under
section
2244
which
gets
to
the
other
important
point
i
wanted
to
make.
the
state
keeps
talking
about
what
the
district
court
said.
well,
when
the
state
--
when
this
case
went
to
the
eleventh
circuit
the
first
time,
the
state
made
it
very
clear.
it
complained,
it
said
the
district
court
can't
remand
this
to
the
state
courts,
it
can't
micromanage
what
a
state
court
does.
all
it
can
do
--
and,
justice
scalia,
this
is,
i
think,
most
clearly
put
in
your
wilkinson
concurrence
is
order
the
release
or
not.
the
federal
court
in
this
case
ordered
magwood's
release
from
the
death
penalty
unless
the
defendant
--
unless
the
state
wanted
to
elect
to
have
a
brandnew
sentencing
proceeding.
now,
the
state
elected
to
do
that,
and
had
every
right
to
do
it.
but
magwood
also
had
every
right
to
insist
on
every
constitutional
protection
in
that
circumstance.
and
if
i
might
finish
this
sentence,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
he
--
we
agreed
if
that
mr.
magwood
had
not
properly
preserved
this
argument
the
second
time
around,
it
would
be
procedurally
defaulted.
and
if
the
state
wants
to
make
that
argument
on
remand,
it
can.
but
understand
that
the
state's
argument
is
asking
you
to
say
that
a
claim
is
barred
from
federal
habeas
even
if
the
defendant
completely
properly
raises
it
the
second
time
around
and
loses
it
and
wants
to
then
bring
it
to
the
federal
courts.
