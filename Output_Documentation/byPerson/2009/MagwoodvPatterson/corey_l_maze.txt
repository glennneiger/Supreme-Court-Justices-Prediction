mr.
corey
l.
maze
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
even
though
they
rose
together,
the
state
has
litigated
magwood's
mitigating
circumstances
in
federal
court
from
1983
to
1986,
and
now
we
have
been
litigating
these
aggravating
circumstances
from
1997
through
today.
that's
piecemeal
litigation.
that's
precisely
the
reason
that
aedpa
was
passed
under
2244(b)
and
that's
precisely
what
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
was
designed
to
prevent.
and
it's
based
on
the
principle
that
this
court
unanimously
affirmed
again
yesterday.
you
have
equitable
principles
that
say
when
you
have
two
parties,
a
party
has
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
raise
a
claim
or
to
litigate.
but
the
other
party
also
has
a
finality
interest.
and
once
you
take
away
your
full
and
fair
opportunity
by
not
using
it,
the
other
party's
interest
in
finality
outweighs.
that's
what
congress
envisioned
in
aedpa.
that's
what
this
court
envisioned
with
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine.
that's
why
we
don't
allow
someone
who
had
a
claim
previously
available
that
didn't
use
it
to
bring
it
again.
and
if
i
may,
i
want
to
go
straight
to
justice
alito's
question
about
conviction
versus
sentence,
and
then
to
justice
kennedy's
about
whether
or
not
under
alabama
law
this
is
aggravated
with
something
new
to
the
resentencing.
as
far
as
judgment
--
conviction
versus
sentence,
i
had
two
answers.
justice
breyer
got
to
the
first.
on
page
106,
the
new
judgment,
as
mr.
magwood
would
say,
says,
"i
hereby
judge
you
convicted
of
the
underlying
offense
in
the
actual
guilt
phase
and
the
sentence.
"
so
it
contains
both,
if
you
consider
that
a
new
judgment.
but
the
second
point
is,
if
magwood
is
correct
that
you
can
separate
a
judgment
of
sentence
and
conviction,
then
burton
is
wrong.
burton
has
to
be
wrong.
because
the
argument
in
burton
was
--
he
cited
in
re
taylor,
which
was
the
exact
same
case
we
put
in
our
brief.
he
said:
my
first
petition
attacked
the
judgment
of
conviction;
my
second
petition
attacked
the
judgment
of
resentence,
and
because
those
are
two
separate
judgments,
this
was
my
first
chance
to
attack
the
judgment
of
sentence.
and
this
court
said:
no,
it's
one
judgment;
it's
conviction
and
sentence.
and
because
your
first
petition
attacked
that
judgment
that
contained
both,
your
second
petition
attacks
the
same
judgment
that
contained
both.
so
if
mr.
magwood
is
right
that
you
can
separate
the
two,
then
burton
has
to
be
wrong.
now--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
and
you
just
answered
justice
kennedy's
question.
the
question
in
this
case
is:
what
changed?
if
you'll
look
at
the
district
court's
opinion,
its
order
from
the
first
case
--
it's
page
228
of
the
opinion
--
it
said:
the
court
finds
that
this
case
must
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
for
resentencing
on
the
existence
of
mitigating
circumstances,
rather
than
two.
justice
kennedy's
question
was--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
because
it's
one
of
two
things.
either
you
vacated
the
entire
judgment
and
the
conviction
and
sentence
are
put
back
together
--
they
are
--
it
is
a
new
judgment
altogether.
or
you
look
at
specifically
what
the
constitutional
infirmity
was
that
the
court
identified
in
that
case.
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
is:
there
are
four
things
under
alabama
law
at
the
time
of
this
case
that
were
necessary
to
have
a
death
sentence.
the
first
was
an
indictment
with
an
aggravating
circumstance.
the
second
was
a
conviction
of
a
capital
offense.
the
third
was
the
state
announcing
an
aggravating
circumstance.
and
the
fourth
was
a
penalty
phase
recommendation
from
the
jury
that
was
unanimous.
when
this
case
went
back,
all
four
of
those
things
were
carried
over
from
the
first
trial.
we
didn't
do
any
of
those
things
again.
they
were
all
carried
over.
they
are
relics
from
the
original
trial.
the
only
thing
new
that
happened
was
we
added
the
two
mitigators
to
the
weighing
calculus
and
it
was
reweighed.
and
we
know
that
is
true
from
the
district
court's
opinion
in
the
second
case.
mr.
magwood
claimed
that
he
could
bring
a
claim
against
the
fact
that
we
didn't
re-empanel
the
penalty
phase
jury,
which,
again,
is
a
sentencing
claim,
and
the
district
court
said
no,
the
state
court
didn't
have
to
re-empanel
the
jury
to
give
another
recommendation,
because
that
wasn't
the
problem
in
the
first
case.
the
only
problem
in
the
first
case
was
not
having
the
two
additional
mitigators.
and
under
the
same
rationale,
the
state's
announcement
of
the
aggravator
was
also
a
relic
from
the
first
case.
and
in
fact,
we
know
that,
because
in
the
circuit
court's
opinion
in
the
first
case,
it
specifically
told
the
state
court:
if
you
will
weigh
the
same
aggravating
circumstance
against
the
four
instead
of
two,
we
won't
question
your
judgment.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
there
is
a
simple
answer
to
why
the
federal
courts
can
deal
with
this,
and
we
know
they
can
deal
with
it.
and
the
answer
is:
when
this
happens
on
direct
appeal
in
a
federal
prisoner's
case
--
for
example,
if
a
federal
prisoner
says
you
shouldn't
have
enhanced
my
sentence
for
this
one
reason,
and
he
gets
a
remand
where
the
sentence
is
vacated,
he
is
resentenced
and
it
comes
back
up
--
the
circuit
courts
are
unanimous.
they
all
say
you
can't
challenge
other
enhancers
from
the
original
sentence
because
you
could
have
raised
it
the
first
time.
i
can
give
you
case
after
case
after
case
where
they
have
done
that.
a
good
example:
judge
posner
had
the
case
u.s.
v.
parker
101
at
3rd
527,
where
he
says
the
exact
same
thing
and
his
analysis
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
a
party
cannot
use
the
accident
of
a
remand
to
raise
in
a
second
appeal
an
issue
that
he
just
as
well
could
have
raised
in
the
first
appeal.
and
the
principle
is
exactly
the
same,
that
the
federal
courts
in
state
habeas
will
look
to
see
is
this
was
an
issue
you
could
have
raised
the
first
time,
and
if
it
was,
you
are
out.
it
would
make
no
sense
under
aedpa
for
a
federal
prisoner
on
direct
appeal
to
give
the
u.s.
government
a
finality
interest
in
enhancers
that
could
have
been
challenged
the
first
time,
but
not
to
give
the
same
finality
interest
to
states
when
they
are
coming
into
federal
court
under
aedpa
for
aggravators
that
have
been
challenged
the
first
time.
again,
the
whole
purpose
of
aedpa
was
to
give
finality
to
the
state.
if
federal
government
is
going
to
get
a
greater
interest
than
the
states,
then
aedpa
is
completely
--
i
mean,
it's
just
completely
wrong.
now,
another
problem
with
magwood's
argument
is,
he
is
going
to
kill
an
entire
line
of
cases,
the
kyzer
cases,
where
you
can
challenge
good
time
credits,
parole
credits.
if
you
remember,
in
kyzer,
you
said
if
you
are
challenging
your
good
time,
you
can
raise
that
in
a
2254
petition.
now,
under
magwood's
rule,
if
you
read
it
as
a
second
or
successive
application
against
a
judgment
--
let's
assume
that
you've
lost
in
your
first
habeas,
so
your
first
petition
is
now
done
and
you
have
lost.
good
time
credits
are
taken
away
from
you.
under
this
court's
precedent,
you
raised
that
in
a
2254
petition,
but
that
petition
will
be
the
second
petition
under
the
same
judgment.
and
he
would
be
barred
because
the
good
time
credit
claims
would
meet
an
exception.
it's
not
new
facts
or
law
that
proves
he's
innocent,
and
therefore
it
is
barred.
the
only
way
that
the
circuits
have
been
able
to
deal
with
that
situation
is
exactly
the
way
the
state's
saying
here
and
that
justice
scalia
is
saying.
you
ask
the
question
first:
is
this
a
claim
that
has
been
available
before?
and
if
it's
not
a
claim
that
was
available
before,
and
because
it's
a
good
time
claim
that
wasn't,
then
you
say
this
is
not
a
second
or
successive
application,
because
it
is
the
first
application
in
which
he
could
have
brought
the
claim.
that's
directly--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
if
i
can,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is:
this
court
has
defined
a
claim
in
gonzalez
v.
crosby,
which
is
a
2254
case,
as
the
assertion
of
a
ground
that
entitles
the
petitioner
to
habeas
relief.
if
you'll
look
at
the
question
presented,
magwood
agrees
that
this
--
this
says
at
the
end:
"the
petitioner
could
have
challenged
his
previously
imposed
but
now
vacated
sentence
on
the
same
constitutional
grounds.
"
if
the
claim
is
grounds
that
can
give
you
relief
and
he
admits
that
it's
the
same
grounds
he
could
have
gotten
relief
on
the
first
time,
it
is
the
same
claim.
now,
to
the
extent
he
is
telling
you
this
is
a
new
injury,
that
--
the
smoke
example
that
mr.
magwood
is
talking
about,
we
disagree
with
that;
to
the
extent
that
he
would
be
right,
the
difference
is
in
this
case,
he
asked
us
to
blow
the
smoke
at
him
a
second
time.
remember
what
happened
in
the
first
proceeding.
magwood
didn't
challenge
the
aggravating
circumstance,
and
then
when
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
he
asked
specifically
the
eleventh
circuit
to
send
this
case
back
for
resentencing
so
that
the
four
mitigators
could
be
weighed
against
the
original
aggravator.
he
asked
for
this
to
go
back
and
to
--
asked
to
have
the
aggravator
applied
to
him
again.
so
he
invited
the
error.
this
is
not
like
a
normal
civil
case
where--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes.
and
again,
the
reason
is
--
it's
just
like
you
said
in
espinoza
yesterday
--
you
get
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
a
claim.
if
you
raise
the
claim
in
the
first
petition,
it's
not
abusive,
as
this
court
said
it
in
mccleskey,
because
mccleskey
says
it
is
only
abusive
if
you
could
have
but
didn't.
and
this
court's
really
already
answered
that
question
in
slack.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
it
was.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i
think
it's
the
same,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
because
in
slack,
you
had
a
first
petition
that
raised
an
exhausted
claim.
it
was
dismissed.
he
raised
what
everybody
acknowledged
was
a
second
in
time
petition,
but
you
said
because
he
didn't
get
an
adjudication
on
the
merits,
we're
going
to
let
him
do
it
again.
the
same
thing
happened
in
martinez-villareal.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
but
in
panetti
--
if
you
remember,
in
panetti,
he
raised
a
--
he
did
not
raise
a
ford
claim
the
first
time
around,
and
this
court
said
yes,
if
we
looked
at
it
only
a
second
in
time,
this
would
be
barred,
but
we
defined
second
or
successive
application
under
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine.
and
because
this
was
the
first
time
this
claim
was
right
you
allowed
him
to
do
it
and
called
it
a
first
application,
and
the
reason
was
because
he
couldn't
raise
it
the
first
time.
now,
back
to
the
point--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
absolutely.
the
point
would
be,
it's
not
an
abuse
of
the
writ
if
you
raise
a
claim
the
first
time
but
don't
have
the
chance
to
have
it
adjudicated.
you
abuse
the
writ,
as
this
court
has
always
said,
by
having
a
chance
to
raise
the
claim
but
then
not
doing
it.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes,
that's
it.
and
that's
directly
in
line--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--what
this
court
has
done
since
aedpa
came
out
on
two
different
occasions,
has
said
the
second
or
successive
petition
is
a
term
of
art,
which
would
give
substance
in
our
previous
habeas
corpus
cases,
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
cases.
this
court
has
always
said
since
aedpa
came
out
that
we
have
to
define
the
term
by
looking
at
what's
an
abuse
of
the
writ.
and
that's
what
the
circuit
courts
have
done.
the
circuit
courts
are
applying
the
same
rule
that
we
have
given
you,
which
is
precisely
what
justice
scalia
said
earlier.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
can
you
repeat?
i'm
sorry.
i
lost
you.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
okay.
the
claim
is
available.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
okay.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
okay.
while
you
are
doing
that,
i
want
to
make
another
point.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
and
it
does
happen.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes,
that's
right.
because
he
didn't
have
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
have
it
adjudicated.
now,
in
this--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
that
seems
to
be
what
the
court
said
in
martinez-villareal.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
and
in
the
forum
--
and
in
the
forum
rule,
number
9
in
the
instructions,
in
big,
bold
letters,
informs
the
petitioner:
you
have
to
raise
every
claim,
subject
to
the
fact
that
you
will
lose
it
if
you
don't.
now,
i
want
to
bring
up
a
point
on
why
this
matters
to
the
state.
on
page
48
of
our
red
brief,
we
showed
you
some
statistics
about
the
number
of
claims
the
petitioners
bring,
but
what
we
didn't
cite
--
it's
on
page
51
and
52
of
the
same
study.
the
study
shows
that
after
aedpa,
13
percent
of
capital
habeas
petitions
nationwide
--
and
if
you
take
texas
out,
it's
actually
18
percent
--
are
granted.
70
percent
of
capital
habeas
petitions
that
are
granted
are
granted
on
penalty
phase
claims
alone.
in
alabama,
we
looked,
and
we
haven't
found
a
conviction-based
grant
in
over
a
decade,
but
we
have
had
two
penalty
phases
in
the
last
two
years.
so
what
mr.
magwood
is
doing
is
asking
you
to
adopt
the
rule
that,
10
percent
of
the
time,
would
put
the
state
and
district
courts
in
the
position
of
relitigating
an
entire
capital
habeas
case.
and
what
we
showed
you
was
capital
habeas
proceedings
are
the
absolute
most
time-consuming
cases
in
the
district
courts.
and
he's
wanting
you
to
throw
away
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
and
the
successive
petition
doctrine
in
cases
where
there
was
a
limited
grant
in
the
first
case.
and
it--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
as
the
point
we
have
been
making
with
justice
alito,
i
just
don't
see
where
he
can
make
that
distinction
between
conviction
and
sentence.
and
if
this
court
just
comes
back
and
says:
new
judgment
means
it
resurrects,
i
can
assure
you
that
the
next
petitioner
will
come
along
and
say:
i
am
not
making
the
same
concession
that
mr.
magwood
did;
judgment
means
conviction
and
sentence,
see
burton.
and
he's
going
to
raise
50
repetitive
claims
from
his
conviction
and
from
his
original
sentence.
and
then
we
have
the
problem
that
the
federal
district
courts
are
already
dealing
with,
if
the
habeas
petitions,
as
we
showed
in
the
brief--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--no,
justice
sotomayor,
and
the
reason
is
collateral
estoppel
is
a
res
judicata
principle
that
doesn't
apply
to
federal
habeas
proceedings.
that's
the
reason
that
the
abuse
of
writ
doctrine
and
the
successive
petition
doctrine
were
created.
when
you
go
all
the
way
back
to
salinger--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--salinger.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no.
the
court
has
always
said
that
res
judicata
in
--
forms,
and
the
case
to
lack
back
to
is
all
the
way
back
to
salinger.
if
you
remember
salinger,
he
had
two
habeas
petitions.
the
first
one
raised
a
claim
on
which
he
lost.
the
second
petition
raised
exactly
the
same
claim,
and
he
lost
again.
and
the
federal
government
--
the
reason
he
lost
is
because
they
said
it
was
barred
by
res
judicata,
in
this
case
claim
preclusion.
it
went
up
to
this
court
and
this
court
said
res
judicata
doesn't
apply
in
federal
habeas
proceedings,
so
that
court
is
wrong.
but
we
understand
the
problems
the
courts
are
going
to
have
because
there
is
no
res
judicata;
therefore
we
are
creating
this
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine,
this
equitable
doctrine,
that
will
allow
the
courts
to
deal
with
the
law
of
collateral
estoppel.
the
only
thing
that
mr.
magwood
has
been
able
to
cite
to
the
court--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--yes.
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
and
--
and
again,
a
further
point
would
be
that,
you
know,
mr.
magwood
keeps
saying
that
just
because
he
won,
this
was
different.
but--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes.
no.
the
courts
always
said
it
is
a
modified
sort
of
res
judicata,
but
they
are
different
in
some
respects.
you
can
use
it
sort
of
as
an
analogy,
but
they
are
different.
the
court
has
said
res
adjudicata
doesn't
apply;
that's
why
we
have
to
have
this
similar
doctrine
because
without
it
you
could
raise
repetitive
claims.
it
was
the
whole
reason
that
the
rule
came
into
existence.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no.
if
he
didn't
raise
it
the
first
time,
he
has
lost
his
opportunity.
that's
wong
doo.
the
very
first
case
that
this
court
ever
decided
under
abuse
of
the
writ
principles,
wong
doo
raised
two
claims,
but
the
second
claim
he
decided
wasn't
good
enough.
he
failed
to
put
on
evidence
and
abandoned
it.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
and
we
will
let
him
do
that.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
the
underlying
claim
itself.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
the
first
--
the
first
answer
is,
the
claim
itself
is
that
i
have
did
i
have
fair
notice
in
1978
that
i
could
get
the
death
penalty?
the
claim
itself,
no,
is
not
meritorious,
but
of
course
that's
our
opinion.
the
eleventh
circuit
hasn't
decided
that
issue
yet,
nor
has
it
decided
what
has
always
been
our
principle
argument:
this
claim
is
also
procedurally
defaulted
because
he
didn't
fairly
present
it
to
the
state
courts.
the
state
courts
never
had
an
opportunity
to
decide
this
fair
warning
claim--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--not
--
not
by
the
state
courts
because
it
wasn't
fairly
presented
to
them.
the
only
--
only
court
to
have
even
talked
about
it
was
the
district
court.
but
again,
the
eleventh
circuit
hasn't
dealt
with
it
because
second
or
successive
is
a
jurisdictional
question,
and
if
the
claim
is
second
or
successive,
then
it's
barred
and
we
simply
haven't
gotten
to
it.
again,
your
honors,
all
we
are
asking
you
to
do
is
uphold
the
abuse
of
the
write
doctrine
for
the
same
reason
the
court
adopted
it
in
1924
all
the
way
through
aedpa,
and
that
is
we
are
going
to
force
petitioners
to
raise
every
claim
they
could
the
first
time,
so
we
prevent
the
state,
the
victim's
family
and
the
federal
court
from
going
through
second
or
third
rounds
of
federal
habeas
litigation
on
grounds
they
could
have
raised
the
first
time.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i
will
cede
my
time
to
the
court.
