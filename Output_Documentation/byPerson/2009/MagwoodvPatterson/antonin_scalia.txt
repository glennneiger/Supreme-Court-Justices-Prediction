justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
get
beyond
that,
what
you
are
talking
about
here
is
the
judgment
under
which
he
is
being
held
in
custody,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
--
even
if
you
divide
it,
that
judgment
hasn't
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
still
--
even
--
his
sentence
has
been
altered
and
it's
sent
back
for
resentencing,
but
he
is
still
being
held
in
custody
under
the
same
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
the
reason
lawlor
doesn't
work
is
what
you
have
there
is
different
acts.
the
later
judgment
is
--
is
not
just
a
later
judgment
with
respect
to
the
same
act.
it's
a
later
judgment
with
--
with
respect
to
a
different
act.
here
you
are
saying
you
want
to
apply
the
same
rule
with
respect
to
a
later
judgment,
redoing
the
judgment
for
the
same
prior
act.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
same
rule
has
to
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
identical
thing.
the
last
one
was
for
the
smoke
that
went
last
year.
the
next
one
is
for
the
smoke
that
went
this
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
act
of
his.
i'm
talking
about
the
act
that
is
the
basis
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
very
same
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
first--
before
you
get
off
whether
this
is
second
or
successive,
although
the
--
the
state
didn't
put
it
this
way,
i
think
what
the
state
is
clearly
saying
is
that
if
it
is
the
second
petition
that
could
have
raised
this
issue,
it
is
second
or
successive.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
that
fit
--
fit
the
statutory
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
use--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
use
"judgment",
either,
and
--
and
--
and
you
are
--
you
are
dragging
in
judgment
as
the
--
as
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
so
if
--
if
this
is
the
--
if
this
is
the
second
time
that
this
claim
could
have
been
presented,
it's
a
second
--
it's
a
second
or
successive
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
would
happen
if
it
had
been
sent
back
on
this
ground,
but
there
was
another
ground
that
he
had
appealed
on
which
the
court
never
reached?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
would
he
still
be
able
to
raise
that
one
on
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he'd
have
to
bring
them
all
in
petition,
too.
you
can't
say,
you
know,
there
are
five
that
weren't
reached
and
bring
a
separate
habeas
reach
for
each
one
of
the
five.
at
first
habeas,
you
would
have
to
bring
all
of
them,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
if
res
judicata
applied,
you
wouldn't
bring
habeas
in
the
first
place
on
an
issue
that
was
wrongly
decided,
right?
if
it
was
decided
res
judicata.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
your
--
your
habeas
claim
would
be
barred.
