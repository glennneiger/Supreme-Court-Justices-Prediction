chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-158,
magwood
v.
patterson.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
sentence
is
--
he
is
convicted,
sentenced
to
10
years,
and
raises
an
argument,
and
only
an
argument,
that
cuts
off
2
years
of
his
sentence.
he
says
under
the
statute
the
maximum
is
8
years,
and
the
court
says,
the
judgment
is
vacated
to
the
extent
it
goes
beyond
8
years.
can
he
then
bring
a
new
challenge
to,
say,
the
whole
sentence,
or
cut
it
off
at
4
years,
or
does
that
limit
his
challenge?
in
other
words,
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
point
that
it's
not
just
the
conviction,
but
if
it's
a
period
of
the
sentence
that
is
not
subject
to
challenge
the
first
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
an
issue
that
we
look
at
all
the
time
under
aedpa.
that's
not
a
new
approach.
aedpa
says,
you
know,
if
you
show
that
a
claim
relies
on
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
made
retroactive,
that
was
previously
unavailable.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
same
inquiry,
as
to
whether
or
not
a
claim
could
not
have
been
raised
in
a
prior
habeas
petition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
an
--
i
thought
your
point
--
i
thought
your
point
was,
oh,
this
is
going
to
be
hard
to
do,
impossible,
as
you
say.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me
those
are
the
exact
same
problems
that
would
arise,
do
arise,
under
aedpa.
you
have
got
to
show
that
it's
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
made
retroactive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
maze.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now,
just
to
follow
up:
it's
very
realistic.
i
think
a
reasonable
judge
might
decide:
look,
if
i
can
dispose
of
this
case
on
ground
one,
you
know,
why
should
i
go
and
decide
all
these
other
issues,
which
may
be
difficult?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
and
so
i
assume
your
point
is
that
he
can
raise
--
he
can
raise
again
issues
that
he
raised
before;
it's
no
fault
of
his
that
the
court
didn't
reach--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
not
the
whole
case.
i
mean,
he
concedes
that
the
conviction
can't
be
challenged.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
just
the
sentencing
aspect.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
maze.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
