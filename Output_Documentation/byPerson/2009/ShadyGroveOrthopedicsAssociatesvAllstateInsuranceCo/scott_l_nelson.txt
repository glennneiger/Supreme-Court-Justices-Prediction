mr.
scott
l.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
the
inception
of
the
rules
enabling
act,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
within
their
scope
of
operation,
rules
promulgated
under
that
act
govern
the
practice
and
procedure
of
federal
courts
in
diversity
and
federal
question
cases
alike.
this
case
concerns
whether
a
new
york
state
law
prohibiting
new
york
state
courts
from
certifying
a
class
applies
in
a
federal
diversity
action
and
displaces
the
otherwise
applicable
federal
class
certification
standards
set
forth
in
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23.
whether
the
case
is
viewed
as
presenting
a
question
under
the
rules
enabling
act
as
construed
in
hanna
v.
plumer,
or
instead
more
generally
as
an
erie
question,
the
answer
is
the
same.
the
state
rule
does
not
govern.
that
result
is
underscored
by
the
class
action
fairness
act,
which
extended
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
to
cases
of
this
type
precisely
so
that
federal
procedural
standards
would
apply.
in
the--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
to
begin
with,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
substantive
rule
because
it
reflects
a
policy.
the
policy
here,
as
described
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
sperry
case,
is
that
the
--
the
legislature
believed
that
class
actions
were
not
necessary
in
this
category
of
cases.
i
think
that
is
ultimately
a
procedural
policy.
it's
not
a
limitation
on--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--they
certainly
did
not
want
to
have
class
actions,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
the
cohen
case
i
think
is
different
in
this
respect,
although
when
cohen
was
decided
shareholder
derivative
actions
together
with
class
actions
were
under
rule
23.
those
things
have
now
been
divorced,
and
shareholder
derivative
actions
differ
from
class
actions
in
the
rule
23
sense
in
a
fundamental
way.
in
rule
23,
the
class
is
composed
solely
of
individuals
who
each
have
a
substantive
right
to
pursue
that
recovery
under
the
relevant
law.
in
a
derivative
action,
the
plaintiff
is
actually
asserting
a
substantive
right
to
--
to
really
assert
a
claim
on
behalf
of
someone
else,
the
corporation.
and
what
the
court
said
in
cohen
and
elaborated
more
in
the
kamen
case
in
1991
is
that
that
question
is
really
a
matter
of
the
law
of
shareholder-corporate
relations,
the
circumstances
in
which
a
shareholder
may
bring
a
derivative
suit,
and
isn't
really
answered
by
the
federal
rules.
and
in
cohen
in
particular,
what
the
court
focused
on--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
the
reason
is
that
rule
23
actually
does
address
the
issue,
and
it's
the
same
issue
that
the
--
that
the
state
rule
tries
to
address,
which
is
whether
the
matters
may
be
certified
as
a
class.
not
only
does
rule
23(b)
provide
explicitly
that
the
court
may
certify
an
action
if
the
rule
23(b)(1),
(2),
or
(3)
criteria
are
met,
but
this
court
also
emphasized
in
the
califano
v.
yamasaki
case
that
under
rule
1,
the
federal
rules
apply
to
all
actions
in
the
federal
courts.
and
what
that
means,
as
the
court
put
it
in
yamasaki,
is
that
a
class
action
is
available,
potentially,
if
the
23
standards
are
satisfied,
in
any
action
within
the
federal
courts,
unless
congress
has
exercised
its
power
to
override
a
federal
rule,
which,
as
the
author
of
federal
law,
congress
is
always
empowered
to
do.
the
difference
as
to
--
as
to
the
state
is
that
the
state
has
no
power
to
displace
federal
law,
and
rule
23,
promulgated
under
the
rules
enabling
act,
is
federal
law.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
i
would
--
i
would
actually
first
go
back
to
what
the
court
said
in
walker,
and
i
don't
think
it's
--
walker
v.
armco,
and
i
don't
think
it's
disavowed
that
that
the
federal
rule
is
given
its
plain
meaning,
and
when
a
collision
is
unavoidable,
the
court
--
the
court
recognizes
conflict.
gasperini,
i
think,
is
--
is
different,
with
due
respect
to
someone
who
probably
knows
more
about
it
than
i
do.
but
as
i
read
gasperini
at
least,
i
see
the
court
there
saying
that
what
is
going
to
be
applied
in
the
federal
court
is
what
it
saw
as
a
substantive
standard
limiting
damages.
that
is
to
say,
damages
are
excessive
if
they
are
in
excess
of
--
manifestly
exceed
what
is--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--it
wasn't
--
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
the
--
the
court
in
gasperini
said
what
it
saw
was
a
substantive
principle
of
new
york
law,
was
that
damages
could
not
exceed
reasonable
compensation
for
the
--
for
the
plaintiff's
injuries.
now,
that
--
that
is
not
a
cap
in
the
sense
of
$1
million,
$5
million,
$50,000.
but
it's
a
cap
in
the
sense
of
providing
the
substantive
standard
by
which
the
court
determines
excessiveness.
and
as
for
rule
59,
the
reason
the
court
saw
no
conflict
there
is
rule
59
simply
provides
the
procedural
mechanism
within
which
a
defendant
makes
a
motion
to
seek
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
of
excessiveness
of
damages.
but
it
--
but
excessiveness
of
damages
is,
to
go
back
to
a
point
that
was
made
in
the
previous
argument,
like
fairness.
fairness
in
relation
to
what?
excessiveness
of
damages
has
to
be
judged
according
to
what
the
state
law
is
on
what
damages
one
is
entitled
to
recover.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
no,
your
honor,
certainly
not.
especially
given
that
their
appendix
--
half
of
it
consists
of
federal
statutes,
which
of
course
are
valid
because
congress
--
congress
can--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
a
significant
number.
i
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
goodly
number.
now,
as
to
the
state
statutes,
i
think
the
state
statutes
are
very
different.
some
of
them
may
or
may
not
be
valid,
but
they
operate
very
differently
from
the
state
statute
at
issue
here.
they
focus
on
particular
rights
of
action.
some
of
them
set
forth
limits
on
recovery
that
really
are
set
forth
as
damages
caps,
and
all
of
them
are
tied
specifically
to
the
substantive
cause
of
action
created
by
state
law.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
i
would
agree
that
that
presents
a
very
different
question.
i'm
not
--
i'm
still
not
certain
that
i
--
that
i
think
that
the
state
court
can
do
that,
because
i
don't
think
that
a
limitation
on
whether
an
action
can
be
brought
as
a
class
establishes
substantive
rights
within
the
meaning
of
the
rules
enabling
act.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
i
--
again,
i
think
that's
what
the
best
answer
to
that
question
would
be,
because
the
--
the
right
in
a
class
action
is
still
an
individual
right;
it's
simply
the
--
the
question
is
simply
whether
multiple
claims
of
multiple
parties
can
be
aggregated
in
a
single
action.
that
doesn't
expand
the
right
that
the
--
that
the
state
legislature
has
created
for
the
individual.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
again,
what
i'm
saying
is
it
certainly
may
make
a
difference
in
the
sense
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
nearly
that
far
to
resolve
this
case.
if
that
case
were
presented,
i'm
simply
saying
that
--
that
i
still
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
establishes
a
substantive
right
within
the
meaning
of
the
rules
enabling
act.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
yes.
as
i've
said,
i
think
the
best
answer
to
that
question
is:
that
does
not
establish
a
substantive
right.
it
establishes
a
procedural
right
with
respect
to--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--yes,
my
answer
would
be
the
same,
but
this
--
the
result
here
doesn't
turn
on
that
answer
being
correct.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
i
think
--
i
think
it's
procedural
in
the
sense
that
it
establishes
--
if
it
establishes
a
right,
the
right
it
establishes
is
procedural
and
procedural
rights
don't
override
the--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--whether
you
--
when
--
when
what
determines
whether
you
get
it
is
the
form
of
the
action
that
you
have
brought
in
a
federal
court
and
whether
it
has
been
brought
aggregated
with
other--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--no.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
i
mean,
one
thing
that
the
court
could
do
is
that
it
could
establish
a
cap
that
applied
with
respect
to--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--i'm
sorry,
yes.
i
misspoke.
the
state
could
certainly
establish
a
cap
that
applied
whether
an
action
was
brought
as
a
class
action
or
an
individual
action.
in
other
words,
for
any
related
series
of
transactions,
the
overall
damages
to
which
this
defendant
can
be
subjected,
whether
in
a
multiplicity
of
individual
actions
or
in
a
class
action
is
x.
that,
i
think,
would
clearly
be
substantive.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
i
think
--
i
think
if
--
if
the
application
of
the
--
of
the
statute
depends
on
whether
--
whether
the
action
is
brought
as
a
rule
23
action
in
federal
court
or
not,
to
me
that's
--
that
is
placing
consequences
on
a
procedural
issue,
and
is
not
a
matter
of
substance.
but,
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
statute
is
very
different
from
that.
this
statute
is
a
statute
that
is
not
even
limited
to
rights
of
action
under
new
york
state
law.
this
is
an
action
that--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--i
--
i
actually
haven't
found
one
that
applies
it
to
actions
arising
under
other
state
laws.
i
have
--
i
found
actions
that
apply
it
to
actions
arising
under
federal
law.
and
the
principal
one--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--that
is
correct.
they
are
rules
--
there
are
decisions
of
the
appellant
division.
but,
as
you
know
this
court
very
shortly
after
deciding
erie
emphasized,
holdings
of
intermediate
state
court
of
appeals
are
very
persuasive
data
as
to
what
state
law
is.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
yes.
and
in
this
case,
the
statute
on
its
face
uses
the
term
"right
of
an
action
brought
under
a
statute.
"
there
is
no
suggestion
in
901(b)
that
it's
limited
to
new
york
state
statutes.
the
term
"statute"
in
the
--
in
the
civil
practice
law
and
rules
is
not
confined
to
new
york
state
statutes.
section
901
as
a
whole
clearly
is
applicable
to
--
to
rights
of
action
brought
under
any
source
of
law.
and
the
new
york
state
courts
in
the
--
the
most
applicable
case,
the
rudgayzer
case,
justified
its
application
of
the
statute
to
a
federal
right
of
action
on
the
ground
that
this
was
merely
an
--
a
--
a
rule
that
governed
local
forms
of
--
of
proceeding.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
a
statute
certainly
phrased
that
way
could
do
both.
the
question
is
when
the
statute
is
not
phrased
that
way,
when
it's
phrased
simply
as
a
general
procedural
instruction
as
part
of
the
general
procedural--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
the
--
the
question
i
think
is
--
is
what
basis
would
there
be
for
construing
it
to
be
both?
it
--
it
--
it's
unitary
in
language--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
i
--
i
certainly
agree
that
statutes
of
limitations
are
generally
applied
by
state
courts
to
foreign
causes
of
action.
and
that's
because,
i
think,
for
choice
of
law
purposes,
they
are
considered
and
were
traditionally
considered
to
be
procedural
matters.
it's
only
with
the
advent
of
erie
that
they
were
characterized
as
substantive
matters
for
purposes
of
--
of
the
application
of
--
of
the
doctrine.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
if
--
if
the
right
of
action
itself
is
delimited,
as
opposed
to
a
statute
of
limitation
which,
you
know,
cuts
off
your
ability
to
sue
but
supposedly
doesn't
cut
off
the
underlying
right,
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
but,
again,
that
goes
to
--
to
the
fact
that,
you
know,
it
does
make
a
difference
whether
a
legislature
chooses
to
establish
a
rule
as
a
general
procedural
matter
or
whether
it
makes
it
integral
to
the
--
to
the
definition
of
the
right.
and
as
this
court
said
in
the
--
in
the
byrd
case,
that
when
looking
at
--
at
state
law
--
and
there
the
question
was
whether
an
issue
was
an
issue
for
the
jury.
but
in
determining
whether
it
would
be
considered
to
be
substantive
or
procedural,
the
question
is
whether
it
is
so
bound
up
with
the
definition
of
the
rights
and
obligations
under
state
law
that
it
will
be
deemed
to
be
part
of
the
substance
of
the
law
or
whether
it
simply
relates
to
a
mode
of
enforcing
the
right.
and
--
and--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
byrd
--
byrd
turns
in
part
on
that,
but
it
also
turns
on
--
on
the
court's
view
that
--
that
that
issue,
whether
a
case
--
an
issue
is
decided
by
--
by
jury
or
judge,
is
--
is
one
that
is
not
substantive
under
the
erie
doctrine.
so
--
so
there
are
two
aspects,
i
think,
to
what
the
court
is
doing
in
byrd.
but
one
of
them--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
you
know,
the
court
didn't
decide
it
as
a
seventh
amendment
issue,
and
--
and
because
that
particular
question,
i
think,
was
--
was
a
question
that
arose
out
of
a
state
law
administrative
scheme,
i
think
it's
controversial
whether
it
--
whether
the
seventh
amendment
would
apply,
and
the
court,
i
think,
advisedly
decided
that
as
an
erie
case
rather
than
as
a
seventh
amendment
case.
i
want
to
also--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--sure.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
outcome
there
would
more
clearly
be
the
same,
because,
again,
it
would
not
be
--
it
would
not
be
part
of
the
--
of
the
new
york
state
law
definition
of
the
right
to
insurance--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
if
--
if
--
if
the
court
put
a
ceiling
on
rights
of
action
under
its
own
law--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--its
own
state
laws,
that
i
think
becomes
a
substantive
matter.
the
statute
that
i
think
you've
--
you've
hypothesized
here
is
one
that
is
based
on
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant
regardless
of
the
source
of
law
under
which
it's
being
sued.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
yes.
well,
that
then,
i
think,
becomes
very
similar
to
the
--
the
hypothetical
statutes
that
justices
ginsburg
and
sotomayor
were
positing,
and
i
acknowledge
that
that
is
--
that
that
is
a
much
harder
question.
but,
again,
i
think,
ultimately,
if
the
--
if
the
issue
addressed
by
the
statute
is,
shall
claims
of
individuals
be
aggregated
and
adjudicated
as
part
of
one
unit,
that
is
a
substantive
matter
--
or
a
procedural
matter
and
is
governed
in
the
federal
courts
by
a
federal
procedural
standard.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
there
--
that
i
think
would
be
a
statute
that
is
serving
a
manifestly
procedural
interest,
and
if
the
federal
courts
have
not
chosen
in
their
rules
to
impose
an
administrative
charge
on
class
actions,
a
state
law
that
purported
to
do
so
would
--
would
not
--
not
have
any
application
to
federal
procedure.
that
--
that
statute
i
think
would
be
not
only
foreclosed
in
its
operation
by
the
rules
enabling
act
and
hanna
v.
plumer,
but
would
just
be,
on
its
face,
something
that,
even
leaving
aside
the
federal
rules,
would
fall
on
the
procedural
side
of
the
line
in
just
classic
erie
terms
because
the
policies
that
it
reflects
are
manifestly
procedural.
and
i
think,
actually,
the
same
is
true
here.
a
statute--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
the
--
the
--
as
i
understand
the
court's
reasoning
in
cohen,
the
security
was
--
was
not
just
for
the
cost
of
the
action,
but
for
the
plaintiff's
liability
to
the
corporation
that
was
created
under
state
law
in
the
case
of
an
unsuccessful
derivative
action.
and
that
liability
was
what
the
court
looked
at
in
cohen
as
--
as
making
--
making
the
fundamental
issue
substantive,
and
the
bond
was
sort
of
the
--
you
know,
the
tail
on
the
dog,
in
the
sense
that
the
court
characterized
it
as
substantive,
having
first
characterized
the
damages
remedy
as
substantive
because
without
the
bond,
according
to
the
majority,
the
remedy
would
be
meaningless.
i
--
you
know,
the
proposition
was
certainly
debatable
--
even
justice--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--right,
and
--
but
--
but
the
remedy
i'm
referring
to
is
the
defendant's
right
to
recover
damages
from
the
plaintiff
under
state
law
if
a
derivative
action
was
unsuccessful.
and
it
was
securing
that
remedy
that
the
--
that
the
court
saw
the
bond
to
be
critical
to,
which
was
not
only
why
it
--
it
treated
it
as
substantive,
but
also
granted
an
interlocutory
appeal
because,
if
--
if
the
bond
wasn't
there,
the
right
to
recover
from
this
plaintiff
would
be
--
would
be
meaningless.
that
was
--
that
was,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court's
reasoning.
if
the
--
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
point
that
my
friend
made
about
the
901(b)
and
that
that
somehow
indicated
that
it
applied
only
to
new
york
state
statutes.
in
fact,
the
new
york
courts
have
applied
that
"unless"
clause
to
federal
statutes,
holding
in
one
case
that
the
truth
in
lending
act
satisfied
the
"unless"
clause
because
it
authorized
a
class
action,
and
in
another
that
the
telephone
consumer
protection
act
did
not
because
it
didn't
authorize
a
class
action.
so
it
actually
is,
i
think,
quite
clear
from
the
language
of
the
statute
and
from
the
court's
application--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--i
think
that's
right.
if
congress
had
provided
that
a
class
action
was
authorized
in
any
court
under
a
statute,
new
york
couldn't
prevent
it.
but
my
point
here
is
that
the
"unless"
clause
is
simply
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
statute,
which
makes
clear
that
it
applies
to
statutes
from
any
source.
and
that
means
that
far
from
being
in
the
heartland
of
erie,
this
is
far
outside
the
heartland
of
erie.
it's
a
case
where
the
state
court
for
procedural
--
or
the
state's
legislature,
for
procedural
reasons,
a
balancing
of
the
fairness
and
efficiency,
the
--
of
class
actions
and
those
things
that
must
--
that
are
requisite
to
the
just,
speedy,
and
efficient--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
but
that's
an
aspect
of
--
of
the
fairness
and
efficiency
of
proceedings.
remember,
of
course,
these
are
not
claims
for
which
the
plaintiffs
can't
recover
in
state
court.
they
are
simply
claims
that
they
have
to
proceed
individually
in
state
court
to
pursue.
and
the
further
point
i
would
make
is
that
the
judgment
that
the
--
that
the
new
york
legislature
makes,
that
statutory
penalties
under
any
set
of
statutes
are
not
appropriate
for
class
treatment,
is
really
contrary
to
the
decision
that
the
rules
drafters
of
rule
23
have
made,
which
actually
specifies
the
circumstances
under
which
classes
can
be
certified
exactly
by
reference
to
the
type
of
relief
sought.
so
it's
a
case
where
the
rule
and
the
state
statute
really
do
cover
the
same
ground,
to
use
the
approach
this
court
took
in
the
burlington
case,
where
it
said
that
a
state
statute
would
not
be
given
effect
when
the
federal
rule
occupies
the
territory.
and
that's--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--and
--
and
rule
59
doesn't
occupy
the
territory
of
the
standard
to
be
applied,
and
rule
41(b)
as
construed
in
semtek
just
does
not
address
preclusive
effect.
and
finally,
again,
on
the
issue
of
ex
ante
forum
choice,
congress,
in
the
class
action
fairness
act,
provided
jurisdiction
so
that
federal
procedural
rules
would
apply.
if,
as
my
friend
argues,
whether
or
not
a
case
can
proceed
as
a
class
action
is
a
matter
of
substantive
right,
that
principle
can't
be
cabined
to
cases
where
the
substantive
--
or
where
the
state
standard
precludes
class
actions.
if
a
class
action,
yes
or
no,
is
a
matter
of
substantive
right,
that
applies
equally
to
state
standards
that
--
that
would
promote
class
actions,
and
therefore,
even
though
as
--
as
my
friend
says,
it
would
be
a
hanna
issue,
there
would
be
an
abridgement
of
a
substantive
right.
so
--
i
see
that
my
time
is--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
the
thought
is
that
that's
an
indication
that
amenability
to
class
actions
should
be
treated
both
for
plaintiffs
and
for
defendants
as
a
matter
of
procedural
right
governed
by
the
federal
rules.
thank
you.
