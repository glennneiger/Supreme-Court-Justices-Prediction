justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
a
procedural
standard
that
has
a
manifestly
substantive
purpose,
which
is
to
restrict
recoveries
of
penalties.
in
that
sense,
it's
like
a
cap
on
damages.
and
if
you're
right,
then
the
purpose
that
new
york
had
would
be
completely
undermined,
because
what
lawyer
would
bring
a
$500
case
in
state
court
when
she
could
bring
a
$5
million
case
in
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
want
to
have
class
actions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
is
it
different
from
cohen
v.
beneficial,
the
security
for
costs?
procedural
in
one
sense,
but
with
a
definite
substantive
purpose
in
mind;
that
is,
to
restrict
derivative
actions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
say
just
as
well
here
that
the
question
isn't
addressed
by
the
federal
rules.
if
new
york
wants
to
say
this
kind
of
claim
can
be
brought
only
as
an
individual
action,
not
as
a
class
action,
why
shouldn't
the
federal
court
say
that's
perfectly
fine;
this
class
of
cases
can't
be
brought
as
a
class
action;
we
respect
the
state's
position
on
that.
why
should
we
as
a
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case
create
a
claim
that
the
--
that
the
state
never
created?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
court
in
its
recent
decisions
has
been
sensitive
to
not
overriding
state
limitations,
and
so
has
read
the
federal
rule
to
avoid
the
conflict.
gasperini
is
one
such
case
with
regard
to
rule
59,
interpreted
so
that
you
do
not
collide
with
the
state
policy,
and
the
same
thing
with
semtek
with
rule
41(b).
the
federal
rule
is
interpreted
so
as
not
to
conflict
with
the
state
policy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
wasn't
a
cap
on
damages
in
gasperini.
it
wasn't
a
cap.
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
that
we
want
the
courts
to
exercise
a
role
in
checking
these
damages
so
they
won't
be
excessive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
suppose
in
this
case
the
new
york
legislature,
instead
of
having
a
statute
that
covered
penalties
generally,
minimum
recoveries
generally,
wrote
into
each
statute,
each
penalty
statute,
each
minimal
recovery
statute,
that
this
suit
must
--
may
not
be
brought
as
a
class
action
--
instead
of
having
an
encompassing
statute
that
covered
all
of
them,
wrote
into
each
individual
statute
that
limitation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
--
are
you
telling
me
that
even
if
new
york
had
provided
for
a
specific
penalty
for
a
specific
matter,
the
federal
court
could
disregard
that
and
make
it
a
class
action,
even
if
the
state
that
created
the
right
said,
this
is
a
right
for
an
individual
only?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
even
if
it
--
then
you
are
telling
me
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
do
it
across
the
board,
as
they
did
here,
or
in
each
penalty
statute
it
says
no
class
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
does
it
or
not?
i
mean,
it
presented
you
--
here's
a
case
that
says:
you
can
sue
for
this
penalty
but
only
in
an
individual
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
saying
that
even
if
new
york
didn't
use
this
shorthand,
even
if
they
incorporated
it
into
each
penalty
statute,
your
answer
would
be
the
same--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
no
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
to
that
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
depends
upon
the
persuasiveness
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
statute
may
put
forth
both
a
substantive
policy
and
a
procedural
policy.
i'll
give
you
a
concrete
example.
new
york
establishes
a
claim
and
says
in
the
statute:
but
this
sort
of
claim
has
to
be
brought
within
1
year.
then
new
york
gets
a
similar
claim
under
another
state's
law,
and
it
says,
even
though
we
applied
our
--
even
though
our
statute
applies
to
our
own
law
in
a
substantive
way
--
that
is,
it
says
you
have
no
action
after
a
certain
amount
of
time
--
we
don't
want
our
courts
to
be
cluttered
with
claims
from
out
of
state
when
we
wouldn't
entertain
similar
claims
in
our
own
state.
that
is
certainly
the
way
statutes
of
limitations
have
been
interpreted
by
a
number
of
states
as
having
both
a
procedural
aspect
and
a
substantive
aspect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
is
not
altogether
true,
because
there
was
always
recognition
that
a
so-called
built-in
statute
of
limitations
was
substantive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
byrd
turned
on
the
characteristics
of
a
federal
court
and
that
is
the
judge/jury
relationship.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
wouldn't
matter
what
the
answer
to
that
was,
with
the
seventh
amendment
looming
over
that
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
it
different
from
security
for
costs?
i
mean,
that's
what
i
started
with.
that's
--
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
rules
that
say
security
for
costs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
without
the
bond,
the
remedy
would
be
--
i
don't
--
this
is
a
plaintiff
that
had
to
put
up
security
for
costs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
new
york
doesn't
have
--
as
the
--
the
question
that
justice
sotomayor
asked
and
that
justice
stevens
asked
--
doesn't
have
any
anti-class
action
as
a
procedural
policy.
it
has
picked
out
a
particular
kind
of
action,
one
for
a
penalty,
one
where
there's
--
what
is
it
--
minimum
recovery,
and
said
that
category,
we
have
--
we're
not
anti-class
action
in
general,
but
these
penalties
that
we
created,
we
don't
want
those
brought
as
class
actions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
--
one
question
that
was
raised
by
the
other
side
is,
well,
if
you're
saying
this
kind
of
restriction
--
restriction
on
class
action
--
applies
in
a
diversity
case,
why
not
a
state
that
says
we
love
class
actions
and
we
want
class
actions
to
be
--
not
to
be
hemmed
in
by
all
of
the
rule
23
requirements?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
could
be
--
it
could
be,
as
i
--
the
example
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
we
create
a
claim.
it
has
a
certain
life.
it's
dead
after
that
time.
that's
new
york
law.
a
sister
state
may
say,
we
create
the
same
claim,
but
we
think
it
has
a
longer
life.
new
york
would
say,
that's
fine.
bring
that
claim
in
your
own
state.
don't
clutter
up
our
courts
with
out-of-state
claims
when
we
would
not
hear
the
identical
claim
under
our
own
law.
there
are
policies
that
do
operate
as
procedural
limitations
and
have
a
substantive
thrust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
new
york
might
well
say,
look,
we
don't
hear
in
new
york
penalty
cases,
and
so
we
are
not
going
to
entertain
the
sister
state
claim
for
any
--
when
we
wouldn't
entertain
our
own.
we
are
not
frustrating
the
sister
state.
they
could
bring
the
class
action
there,
but
not
in
--
not
in
our
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
--
they
bring
up
the
class
action
fairness
act,
which
allows
a
plaintiff
--
they
allow
a
defendant
to
remove
a
class
action
from
a
state
court
to
a
federal
court,
but
they
also
allow
a
plaintiff
to
initiate
an
action
in
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
--
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
federal
statute,
there's
a
--
there's
a
factor
that
doesn't
come
up
when
you
are
dealing
with
sister
states,
and
that
is
the
supremacy
clause.
if
congress
has
made
a
judgment
--
let's
say
1983
--
i
don't
think
the
state
that
says,
for
our
comparable
claims,
we
don't
allow
class
action
could
--
could
apply
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
can't
see
how
that's
so
when
they
limit
just
a
particular
remedy
or
penalty.
if
they
were
saying,
well,
across
the
board
we
don't
want
class
actions,
i
could
follow
your
argument
much
better.
but
when
new
york
singles
out
penalties,
it
seems
to
be
talking
not
about
the
efficiency
and
fairness
of
proceedings,
but
that
it
doesn't
want
penalty
claims
to
be
magnified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
didn't
say
that
about
rule
59,
and
it
didn't
say
that
about
rule
41(b).
