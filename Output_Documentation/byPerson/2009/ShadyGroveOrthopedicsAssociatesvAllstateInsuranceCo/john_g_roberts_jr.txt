chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-1008,
shady
grove
orthopedic
associates
v.
allstate
insurance.
mr.
nelson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
--
under
your
theory,
are
all
of
the
statutes
set
forth
by
the
respondents
in
their
appendices
invalid
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
not
half.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
apply
to
individual
actions
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
basis
for
the
restriction
is
the
additional
administrative
costs
of
a
class
action?
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
say
you
can't
bring
it,
but
it
says
any
recovery
shall
be
reduced
by
10
percent
because
class
actions
cost
more
than
individual
actions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
landau.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
i
--
do
i
understand
your
response
to
turn
on
--
let's
say
the
state,
for
example,
limits
class
actions
because
it
doesn't
want
vast
exposure
under
the
penalty
provisions
that
you
could
get
in
a
class
action.
it
only
wants
to
pay
when
they
can
be
brought
on
an
individual
basis.
but
they
may
also
limit
class
actions
by
saying,
as
justice
sotomayor
suggested,
that
they
are
not
fair
and
efficient.
do
you
get
one
result
in
the
former
case
and
a
different
result
in
the
latter?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
tell?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
it's
pertinent,
then,
whether
they
do
it,
as
i
think
you
were
--
was
discussed
earlier,
on
an
across-the-board
basis
or
on
an
individual
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
guess--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
--
but
wouldn't
justice
stevens's
hypothetical
suggest
that
they
were
less
concerned
about
the
impact
of
--
of
the
class
action
procedure
than
they
were
about
its
procedural
efficiency?
in
other
words,
i
understand
your
position
if
you're
saying,
look,
we've
only
got
$20
million
in
this
fund
to
pay
plaintiffs
and
we
think
it's
better
to
go
on
an
individual
basis,
because
if
it's
a
class
action,
you
know,
it
would
be
over
in
one
shot
or
whatever--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
it's
not
appropriate
to
say,
we
don't
like
the
class
action
procedure
as
a
general
matter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
justice
stevens's
hypothetical,
it
applied
across
the
board,
which
would
cause
me,
anyway,
to
think
it
was
the
latter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
--
it
only
reflects
a
substantive
choice
--
if
it
is
a
substantive
choice.
if
they
say,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
class
actions
because
we
think,
procedurally,
they
are
a
bad
idea
because
we
think
lawyers
get
too
much
recovery
when
they
recover
--
in
other
words,
it
--
your
--
your
position
depends
upon
a
characterization
of
the
ban,
and
the
restriction
on
class
actions
is
either
substantive
or
procedural.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
question
is
new
mexico
causes
of
action.
can
they
decide
that
they
don't
want
actions
from
outside
of
the
state
to
be
brought
as
class
actions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
it
would
do,
it
seems
to
me,
is
make
it
clear
that
was
not
a
substantive
decision,
but,
instead,
a
procedural
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
landau.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
nelson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
thought,
if
you
like.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
081008,
shady
grove
orthopedic
association
versus
allstate
insurance.
