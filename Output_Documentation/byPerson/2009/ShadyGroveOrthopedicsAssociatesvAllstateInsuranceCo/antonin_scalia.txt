justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
applied
it?
if
i
recall
your
brief
correctly,
you
say
that
the
new
york
courts
have
applied
it
to
causes
of
action
arising
under
other
state
laws.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
a
statute
be
both?
can
a
statute
both
establish
a
substantive
limitation
and
also
establish
a
rule
of
procedure
for
new
york
courts?
why
can't
a
statute
say,
new
york
courts
will
not
entertain
any
action,
including
those
arising
under
foreign
law,
that
are
class
actions
seeking
penalties?
and
also,
no
new
york
state
cause
of
action
which
seeks
a
penalty
can
be
sued
on
in
a
--
in
a
collaborative
action?
couldn't
you
do
both
in
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
are
begging
the
question.
it's
a
general
instruction.
but
can't
--
can't
the
instruction
be
interpreted
to
be
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other,
though.
you
--
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
if
this
is
substantive,
as
you
contend,
it
cannot
be
procedural?
so
new
york
state
could
not
apply
this
--
this
rule
to
out-of-state
causes
of
action,
and
if
it
did,
you
--
you
ought
to
have
lost
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
now
the
petitioner
shady
grove
orthopedic
associates
provided
medical
care
to
sonia
galvez
for
injuries
she
suffered
in
a
car
accident.
as
partial
payment
for
that
care,
galvez
assigned
to
shady
grove
her
rights
to
insurance
benefits
under
a
policy
issued
in
new
york
by
respondent
allstate
insurance.
shady
grove
tendered
a
claim
for
the
benefits
to
allstate.
allstate
eventually
paid,
but
not
within
30
days
as
required
by
new
york
law
and
it
refused
to
pay
shady
grove
statutory
interest
that
accrued
on
overdue
benefits.
shady
grove
filed
this
diversity
suit
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
seeking
relief
for
itself
and
a
class
of
all
others
to
whom
allstate
allegedly
owes
interest
on
overdue
benefits.
the
district
court
concluded
that
it
could
not
certify
allstate’s
proposed
class
whether
or
not
the
class
satisfied
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23,
which
prescribes
the
requirements
for
class
actions.
because
new
york
civil
practice
law
section
901-b
provides
in
pertinent
part
that
absent
specific
statutory
authorization
“an
action
to
receive
a
penalty
may
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action.”
concluding
that
the
statutory
interest
shady
grove
sought
is
a
penalty,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
since
shady
grove's
claim
alone
not
gummed
in
with
the
class
action,
fell
far
short
of
the
amount
of
controversy
requirement
for
diversity
suits
in
federal
court,
visor
is
glazed
over
already.[laughter]
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit.
when
a
federal
rule
of
procedure
promulgated
pursuant
to
congress’
authorization
in
the
rules
enabling
act
answers
the
question
in
dispute,
the
federal
rule
controls
unless
it
exceeds
the
enabling
act's
authorization
or
congress’
rule
making
power.
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
federal
rule
23
answers
the
question
here
in
dispute,
whether
shady
grove
suit
may
proceed
as
a
class
action.
rule
23
states
that
“a
class
action
may
be
maintained”
if
rule
23’s
criteria
are
satisfied
and
if
the
suit
fits
into
one
of
the
categories
described
in
rule
23-b.
because
new
york
civil
practice
law
section
901-b
attempts
to
answer
the
same
question,
it
says
shady
grove
suit
may
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
because
of
the
relief
it
seeks,
it
cannot
apply
in
diversity
suits
unless
rule
23
is
ultra
vires.
the
second
circuit
held
and
allstate
argues
that
rule
23
and
901-b
do
not
conflict
because
they
address
different
issues.
rule
23
they
say,
addresses
whether
a
given
class
should
be
certified
while
901-b
addresses
the
antecedent
question
of
whether
a
particular
type
of
claim
is
eligible
for
class
treatment
at
all.
we
disagree.
this
eligibility,
certifiability
distinction
is
entirely
artificial.
both
eligibility
and
certifiability
amount
to
prerequisites
for
maintaining
the
class
action.
allstate
argues
that
we
should
read
rule
23
to
avoid
overstepping
the
rules
enabling
act.
if
rule
23
were
susceptible
of
two
readings,
one
that
violated
the
act
and
one
that
did
not,
we
would
agree,
but
it
is
not.
so
we
must
confront
head-on
whether
rule
23
validly
applies.
a
majority
of
the
court
concludes
that
it
does
though
not
all,
not
all
five
of
that
majority
for
the
same
reason.
in
the
plurality
opinion,
are
you
with
me,
[laughter]
in
the
plurality
opinion
joined
in
full
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
and
joined
in
part
by
justice
sotomayor,
we
hold
that
rule
23
is
valid
because
it
regulates
procedure.
the
liberty
of
a
federal
rule
of
procedure
is
not
governed
by
erie,
erie
railroad
versus
tomkins
which
applies
only
to
judge
made
rules,
but
rather
by
the
rules
enabling
act.
that
act
allows
this
court
to
promulgate
rules
of
procedure
for
the
federal
courts
with
the
limitation
that
those
rules
quote
“shall
not
abridge,
enlarge
or
modify
any
substantive
right.
we
held
nearly
70
years
ago
in
sibbach
versus
wilson
and
company
that
this
limitation
means
that
a
federal
rule
“must
really
regulate
procedure,”
that
is
the
judicial
process
for
enforcing
rights
and
duties
recognized
by
substantive
law
and
for
justly
administering
remedy
and
redress
for
disregard
or
infraction
of.”
we
have
applied
that
test
ever
since.
what
matters
then
is
not
whether
a
federal
rule
has
some
effect
on
substantive
rights,
most
procedural
rules
do.
what
matters
is
what
the
federal
rule
regulates.
applying
that
criterion
here,
rule
23
is
valid
insofar
as
it
allows
willing
plaintiffs
to
join
their
separate
claims
against
the
defendant,
just
like
ordinary
rules
of
joinder,
class
actions
merely
enable
a
federal
court
to
adjudicate
claims
of
multiple
parties
at
once
instead
of
separate
suits.
allowing
the
suite
to
proceed
as
a
class
action
does
not
change
the
party’s
rights,
the
availability
of
remedies
or
the
rules
and
the
decision.
allstate
argues
that
class
actions
drastically
alter
the
liability
defendants
face,
transforming
this
suit
from
a
$500
suit
to
a
$5
million
suit.
but
allowing
the
suit
to
proceed
as
a
class
action
does
not
change
allstate's
aggregate
liability
since
individual
plaintiffs
could
each
bring
their
own
lawsuit.
the
fact
that
fewer
plaintiffs
would
do
so
on
their
own
does
not
matter
that
is
the
sort
of
incidental
effect
of
the
federal
rule
that
we
have
said
does
not
violate
the
enabling
act.
allstate
also
argues
that
90-b
gives
it
a
substantive
right
not
to
face
class
action
liability
in
a
single
suit.
we
doubt
that
is
true,
but
it
is
beside
the
point.
the
substantive
character
of
the
specific
state
law
that
is
displaced
is
not
the
issue.
a
federal
rule
is
not
valid
in
some
states
and
invalid
in
others.
under
the
test
established
in
sibbach
and
followed
ever
since,
what
matters
is
whether
the
federal
rule
regulates
the
substance
or
procedure.
we
acknowledge
that
keeping
the
federal
court
door
open
to
class
actions
will
produce
forum
shopping.
that
is
unacceptable
for
judge
made
rules
governed
by
erie
for
where
positive
federal
law
does
not
provide
the
rule
of
decision
or
authorize
courts
to
supply
one,
state
law
must
control.
but
divergence
from
state
law
and
hence
the
forum
shopping
that
comes
with
it,
is
an
inevitable
and
perhaps
intended
consequence
of
a
uniform
system
of
federal
procedure.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
kennedy,
breyer
and
alito
have
joined.
