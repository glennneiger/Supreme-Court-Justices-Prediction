justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
was
you
are
entitled
to
$100
as
a
statutory
penalty
but
only
if
it's
an
individual
claim.
if
you
--
if
this
is
brought
as
a
class
action,
you
don't
get
the
statutory
penalty.
i
thought
that
was
the
substance
of
her
question.
now,
are
you
saying
that
also
is
merely
procedural
and
--
and
pre-empted
by
rule
23?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
get
$100
or
you
don't
get
$100.
how
can
you
be
any
less
substantive
than
getting
the
$100
or
not
getting
the
$100?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
under
your
view,
there
is
absolutely
nothing,
no
law
that
the
state
could
pass
that
would
not
conflict
with
rule
23--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
it
--
as
with
respect
to
class
actions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
mean
the
state
could
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
rule
23
a
judgment
by
congress
that
class
actions
that
meet
the
criteria
of
rule
23
are
fair
and
efficient,
correct?
that's
congress's
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
your
theory,
any
state
could
pass
a
law
that
says
no
cause
of
action
under
state
law
can
be
brought
as
a
class
action
ever.
that
would
be
your
theory
because
it's
substantive,
if
it's
an
erie
choice.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
quite
answered
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
state
can
come
in
and
say,
no
state
cause
of
action
will
ever
be
subject
to
class
treatment.
and
you
would
say
there
is
no
conflict
between
that
and
rule
23?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
no
state
cause
of
action
can
be
brought
as
a
class.
you're
saying
there
is
no
conflict
with
rule
23's
judgment
about
efficiency
of
federal
court
litigation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
what
it's
doing
here.
there
are
some
things
--
we
make
a
policy
choice,
the
state,
that,
contrary
to
rule
23,
that
there
are
some
causes
of
action
that
are
not
fairly
and
efficiently
brought
as
a
class.
that's
what
the
state
has
said
as
a
policy
choice,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
a
policy
choice.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
have
answered
my
question.
under
your
view,
a
state
could
say,
no
class
actions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
--
and
a
federal
court,
sitting
in
diversity,
could
never
aggregate
those
claims,
those
state
law
claims?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
how
can
you
say
that?
the
case
itself
says:
we
read
the
language
of
the
statute;
congress
didn't
say
this
was
to
be
a
class
action;
we
are
not
permitting
it.
i
understand
the
difference,
and
it
could
have
argued
or
analyzed
the
case
the
way
you
said,
but
the
appellate
division
there
did
exactly
what
your
adversary
said
it
did.
