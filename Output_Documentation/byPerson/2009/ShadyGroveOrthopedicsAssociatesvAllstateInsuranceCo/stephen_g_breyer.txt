suppose
the
reason
--
suppose
the
reason
that
they
did
that
--
suppose
they
are
very
honest
about
their
reasons,
and
they
say,
we
think
class
actions
are
very
often
a
very
good
thing,
because
a
lot
of
people
who
are
hurt
can
get
some
recovery
and
it
acts
as
a
deterrent.
but
there
is
some
bad
things
about
them.
and
one
of
the
bad
things
is,
somebody
files
a
lawsuit,
and
before
you
know
it,
the
litigation
expenses
are
so
high
that
the
company
feels
it
has
to
settle.
now,
in
our
view
that
latter
factor
predominates.
and
that
means
that
these
procedures,
class
actions,
will
sometimes
--
too
often
--
lead
to
the
unjust,
inefficient
settlement
of
disputes.
and
that's
why
we
are
doing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
if
that's
exactly
what
we
did,
why
isn't
that
second-guessing
the
judgment
of
the
rule
that
they
are
saying
it
is
efficient
--
an
inefficient
procedure.
it
is
inefficient
in
terms
of
the
object
of
--
of
the
federal
rules
and
what
the
class
wanted.
we
want
efficient
methods
of
achieving
justice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
overdeterrence
because
they
feel
that
the
class
action
procedure
is
one
that
leads
to
forcing
companies
to
settle,
and
to
that
extent
the
class
action
procedure
does
not
lead
to
the
efficient
determination
of
disputes
but
to
the
inefficient
and
unjust
determination.
that's
their
honest
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
does.
it
says
it's
the
judicial
process
that
does
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
judicial
process
and
its
expanse--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
forces
the
settlements
that
create
unjust
results.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be,
and
suppose
they
said,
you
know,
a
30-day
period
for
appeal
creates
unjust
results
in
our
opinion,
and
therefore
we
think
it
is
more
efficient
to
have
a
90-day
appeal
period.
that
wouldn't
last
for
2
seconds,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
is
this
different?
