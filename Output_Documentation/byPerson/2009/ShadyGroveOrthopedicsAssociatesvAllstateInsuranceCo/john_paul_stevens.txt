justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
brief
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
this
statute,
instead
of
being
as
broad
as
it
is,
said
any
statute
imposing
penalties
against
insurance
companies
may
not
be
brought
as
a
class
action,
any
claims
brought
under
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
that
if
it
puts
a
ceiling
on
it,
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
substantive
rather
than
procedural.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
can
make
it
a
claim
brought
under
the
insurance
code,
instead
of
against
insurance
companies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
well,
let
me
be
--
i
just
say
i
want
--
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
sotomayor.
is
it
your
position
that,
if
we
follow
your
view
in
this
case,
it
would
also
be
true
that
--
if
new
york
had
passed
a
statute
saying
no
cause
of
action
based
on
new
york
law
may
be
maintained
as
a
class
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
--
that
would
apply
not
only
to
statutory
causes
of
action
but
causes
of
action
based
on
new
york
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
am
not
lost
on
one
point.
does
this
just
apply
to
statutory
cause
of
action
created
by
new
york
law?
or
does
it
apply
to
a
statutory
cause
of
action
created
by
new
mexico
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
language
doesn't
limit
it
that
way,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
question:
supposing
it
did
apply
to
statutory
cause
of
actions
created
by
new
mexico
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
basically
is
that
new
york
can
decide
what
kinds
of
cases
shall
be
brought
as
class
actions,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
whatever
the
reason--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
some
good
reason.
