mr.
christopher
landau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
some
of
justice
ginsburg's
initial
questions
point
out,
this
case
falls
within
the
heartland
of
erie
because
allowing
plaintiffs
to
recover
state
law
penalties
in
federal
court
that
they
can't
recover
in
state
court
on
a
state
law
cause
of
action
would
powerfully
distort
ex
ante
forum
choices,
which
is
precisely
what
the
erie
doctrine
seeks
to
avoid.
mr.
christopher
landau
no,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
landau
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
of
course,
rule
23
is
not
enacted
by
congress.
that's
one
of
the
important
points
here,
that
it
comes
out
of
this
court.
it's
delegated
authority
under
the
rules
enabling
act
to
set
forth
these
rules,
so
there
is
always
a
limitation
on
what
a
rule
of
procedure
can
do.
that's
why
there
is
an
advisory
committee
that
sets
it.
it's
not
a
statute,
and
there
are
--
there
are
restrictions
on
--
on
the
rules
that
don't
apply
to
congress.
but
going
to
the
substance
of
your
question,
your
honor,
rule
23
governs
the
criteria
for
when
--
when
you
can
have
a
class,
but
it
doesn't
address
the
underlying
question,
which
is:
can
you
have
a
class
in
the
first
place?
is
there
--
the
legislature
that
creates
the
cause
of
action
can
say,
this
is
categorically
ineligible
for
class
certification.
mr.
christopher
landau
i'm
sorry.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
your
honor,
if
the
state
is
talking
about
its
own
state
law
causes
of
action,
the
state
is
the
master.
the
state
creates
these
causes
of
action
in
the
first
place.
if
a
state,
like
new
york
did
here,
says
certain
causes
of
action--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
your
honor,
it
could
be,
if
a
state
said
that
no
state
cause
of
action
could
be
brought
as
a
class
action,
that
that
--
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
state
was
doing
in
making
that
rule.
if
the
state--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
your
honor,
no,
because
the
policy
choice
here
is
a
substantive
policy
choice
to
limit
penalties
from
being
distorted
in
a
class
action
case.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
if
the
--
if
the
state,
your
honor,
makes
a
policy
choice,
it
is
a
substantive
policy
choice,
as
i
believe
--
your
hypothetical,
at
some
points,
was
talking
about
what
sounded
like
a
substantive
policy
choice.
if
it
makes
a
procedural
policy
choice,
as,
in
a
sense,
mississippi
has
done
and
virginia,
by
simply
not
having
class
actions
at
all
--
they
don't
have
that
--
well,
then
that
doesn't
raise
an
issue
under
the
rules
of
decision
act
because
it's
not--
mr.
christopher
landau
--a
state--
mr.
christopher
landau
--for
state
law
claims,
yes.
if
it
makes
a
substantive
decision
that
we
want
--
a
state
could
abolish
that
cause
of
action
altogether,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
concern
that
your
honor
is
expressing
is
somehow
that
federal
courts
could
be
flooded
with
state
law
causes
of
action.
well,
that
won't
happen
because
they
would
still
have
to
meet
federal
jurisdictional
norms
to
get
into
federal
court.
so
you
won't
get
small
state
law
claims.
you
would
still
have
to
meet
the
requirements
for
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
the
erie
--
you
could,
your
honor.
the
answer
--
the
short
answer
is
"yes",
because
the
erie
cases
have
looked
to
the
purpose.
i
think
justice--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
your
honor,
it's
not
always
easy.
erie
cases,
for
that
reason,
are
not
always
--
result
in
easy
line-drawing.
certainly,
in
making
the
erie
choice,
this
court
has
looked
to
the
state's
purpose.
here,
in
this
case,
it
happens
to
be--
mr.
christopher
landau
--i
think
that's
something
that
one
could
look
at,
as
part
of
determining
how
--
what
is
the
design
and
operation
in
state
court.
and
on
that
point,
i'll
say
the
other
side
does
try
to
make
it
seem
like
it
is
absolutely
dispositive
that
this
is
being
applied
more
broadly
than
new
york
state
law
causes
of
action.
there
is
two
responses.
first,
they
really
haven't
proven
that.
the
only
case
they
have
that
actually
has
applied
it
to
anything
other
than
a
new
york
cause
of
action
is
the
rudgayzer
case
under
the
telephone
consumer
protection
act,
which
is
a
very
unique
federal
statute
that
specifically
incorporates
state
law.
it
looks
to
state
law.
and
the
rudgayzer
court
didn't
come
in
and
say,
this
is
broadly
applicable
to
a
federal
cause
of
action.
it
relied
on
that
very
language.
mr.
christopher
landau
we
are
--
we
disagree
--
i
mean,
what
the
court
did
in
rudgayzer
--
they
did
not
say,
this
applies
broadly
to
all
new
york
--
to
all
federal
causes
of
action.
it
looked
at
the
tcpa
and
said
the
tcpa
is
a
special
statute
that
refers
to
the
law
of
the
state.
it's
an
unusual
statute.
so
again,
i
think
the
rudgayzer
case,
if
you
look
at
the
analysis,
it
supports
us.
but
even
more
broadly,
your
honor,
i
think
the
key
point
is
what
they
are
trying
to
get
at
somehow
by
--
by
saying
that
this
applies
broadly
is
to
say
that
new
york
would
treat
this
as
procedural.
and
they
are
--
they
are
asking
this
court
essentially
to
speculate
on
that.
but
there
is
no
need
to
speculate
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
2
years
ago
addressed
this
statute
in
quite
some
detail
in
the
sperry
case,
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
actually
went
through
why
the
statute
was
adopted,
why
901(b)
was
adopted.
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
it
was
a
response.
the
word
--
it
said,
you
know,
when
--
when
new
york
modernized
its
class
action
statute
regime
in
1975,
there
was
concern
expressed
among
a
lot
of
people
that
applying
penalties
on
a
class-wide
basis,
statutory
penalties
and
minimum
measures
of
recovery
unrelated
to
any
actual
damages,
would
be
distorted
and
there
would
be
overdeterrence
and
overkill
in
the
class
action
context.
mr.
christopher
landau
i
think
that's
exactly
what
they
did
here,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
landau
i'm
sorry,
to
the
extent
--
the
hypothetical
i
thought
you
were
saying,
they
were
recognizing
that
it
would
be
overdeterrence--
mr.
christopher
landau
--right,
your
honor.
i
think
what
--
what
i
hear
them
saying
in
your
hypothetical
is
not
really
the
operation
of
judicial
process.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
criteria.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
i
think--
mr.
christopher
landau
--i
think--
mr.
christopher
landau
--right,
but
i
think
there
they
are
looking
at
the
unjust
results.
as
i
hear
your
hypothetical,
you're
saying--
mr.
christopher
landau
--no,
because
then
you
would--
mr.
christopher
landau
--because
then
you
would
have
a
clear
hanna
problem,
your
honor.
i
think
--
let's
go
back
to
the
threshold
question.
they
try
to
get
around
what
is
a
clear
forum
distortion,
a
clear
erie
problem
by
saying
you
don't
even
get
to
erie
because
you
have
a
threshold
hanna
issue,
which
is
rule
23
answers
this
question.
i
didn't
hear
any
real
analysis
from
the
other
side
of
what
is
it
in
rule
23
that
actually
says
that
you
must
be
able
to
certify
a
class
in
every
single
cause
of
action
that
comes
before
you,
even
if
the
very
legislature
that
created
the
cause
of
action
says
you
may
not
have
a
class?
in
fact,
i
think
the
chief
justice
earlier
asked
how
this
case
differs
from
the
statutes
in
appendices
a
and
b.
and
i
think
i
really
didn't
really
hear
a
very
clear
answer.
the
statutes
in
appendix
a
are
all
statutes
where
states
and
the
federal
government
have
put
caps
on
the
recovery
in
class
actions.
that
shows
that
you
can
have
a
substantive
cap
on
what
is
a
procedural
device.
mr.
christopher
landau
yes,
your
honor.
if
new
york
did
that
--
i
guess
my
answer
is
--
you
really
would
have
to
look
behind
that.
if
it
simply
said
--
if
mississippi
and
virginia
codified
their
current
nonexistence
of
--
nonauthorization
of
class
actions
under
state
law
and
affirmatively
said
that
there
may
not
be
a
class
action--
mr.
christopher
landau
--right.
under
--
under
new
york
law.
if
they
were
making
decisions,
they
having
created
these
causes
of
action
under
their
own
state's
law,
if
they
think
it
would
be
overdeterrent
to
have
these
kinds
of
actions
brought
on
a
class-wide
basis
and
they
were
really
enacting
this
for
purposes
of
limiting
the
remedies
that
were
available
for
these
causes
of
action
that
they
created,
i
--
there
would
be
a
strong
argument
that
that
should
apply
under--
mr.
christopher
landau
--under
erie.
mr.
christopher
landau
right.
mr.
christopher
landau
right.
mr.
christopher
landau
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
if
you
have
an
unadorned
prohibition
on
class
actions
in
the
state
--
from
a
state,
i
think
the
most
natural
understanding
of
that
is
that
was
their
determination
of
how
the
procedures
in
their
courts
are
going
to
work.
mr.
christopher
landau
no,
your
honor
--
again,
i
think
they
can
blend.
i
think
in
gasperini
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
--
the
heightened
standard
of
judicial
review
of
damages
awards
had
a
manifestly
--
it
was
a
procedural
command
with
a
manifestly
substantive
purpose.
i
think
this
case
is
not
really
dissimilar.
instead
--
the
cases
in
appendix
a
say
that
in
a
class
--
excuse
me,
the
statutes
say
in
a
class
action
you
may
not
recover
more
than
x.
the
only
difference
here
is
it
says,
if
you
are
seeking
to
recover
more
than
x,
you
may
not
have
a
class
action.
and
with
respect
to
the
statutes
in
appendix
b,
those
say
there
may
not
be
a
class
action
for
particular
causes
of
action.
i
don't--
mr.
christopher
landau
--precisely,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
underscores
is
why
this
is
substantive
or
the
fact
that
this
reflects
a
substantive
policy
decision.
it
is
not
about
the
efficiency
or
operation
of
the
class
action
process
itself,
the
judicial
process.
this
is
a
substantive
decision
to
calibrate
the
remedy
that
new
york
has
afforded
under
its
own
law,
and
a
decision
that
when
you
have
penalties
that
new
york
has
decided
--
and
the
sperry
case
is
very
explicit
on
this
--
that
new
york
made
a
decision
that
the
--
the
appropriate
level
of
enforcement
for
those
was
the
level
in
an
individual
action,
and
that
when
you
got
--
when
you
tried
to
make
it
into
a
class,
that
that
would
be
overenforcement
of
those.
and--
mr.
christopher
landau
--then,
your
honor,
you
would
have
a
hanna
issue
because
rule
23
does
set
forth
the
criteria
for
a
federal
court
to
certify
a
class.
state
law
cannot
change
or
water
down
those
criteria
or
direct
that
you
get
to
the
goal
line
of
a
certified
class
by
some
mechanism
other
than
the
rule
23
criteria.
our
position,
your
honor,
our
point
is
that
you
don't
get
to
the
rule
23
criteria
if
the
state
law
or
the
substantive
law
that
creates
the
cause
of
action
sends
you
off
the
highway
before
you
get
into
the
land
of
the
criteria.
if
it
just
says,
this
is
categorically
unavailable
as
a
class,
as
many
states
have,
in
fact,
done
in
the
statutes
in
appendix
b
--
they
have
come
up
with
novel
causes
of
action
sometimes,
abusive
e-mail
cause
of
action.
and
they
said,
well,
we
do
not
want
a
class
action
to
be
brought
for
this
kind
of
claim.
that
is
a
decision
that
reflects
a
substantive
choice
by
the
legislature
that
it
would
be
overdeterrence
and
overenforcement
to
have
this
brought
on
a
class-wide
basis.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
you
can
--
you
can
assume
that,
if
they
are
not
changing
their
criteria
and
not
changing
the
rules
governing
all
class
actions,
but
singling
out
particular
causes
of
action
or
particular
penalties,
that
it's
done
for
a
substantive
reason.
here,
in
new
york,
we
actually
know
that's
true
because
the
sperry
court
says
that.
and
one,
i
think,
important
point
in
901(b)
is
the
initial
clause,
the
"unless"
clause,
that
we
have
been
focusing
a
lot
on
the
last
clause
that
says
it
may
not
be
brought
as
a
--
as
a
class
action,
if
it's
seeking
a
statutory
penalty.
but
it
says,
"unless
a
statute
creating
or
imposing
a
penalty
or
minimum
measure
of
recovery
specifically
authorizes
the
recovery
thereof
in
a
class
action.
"
that's
showing,
that
even
though
this
is
located
in
the
cplr,
that
it's
really
part
and
parcel
of
their
statutory
regime.
it's
saying,
this
is
our
statutory
default
rule.
to
be
sure,
a
new
york
statute
can
override
that,
but
the
idea
that
this
is
somehow
simply
procedural
because
it's
in
the
cplr
is
really
belied
by
that
language
that
--
that
really
shows
that
--
and,
frankly,
i
think
it
also
belies
the
fact
that
this
applies
to
causes
of
action
outside
of
new
york
because
the
"unless"
clause
really
can
only
be
understood
as
setting
a
default
baseline
for
the
new
york
legislature
in
enacting
a
statute,
that
they
may
want
to
specifically
authorize
class
actions
for
penalties.
so,
again,
i
think--
mr.
christopher
landau
--new
york
law,
your
honor.
there's
nothing--
mr.
christopher
landau
--you
are
right,
your
honor,
but,
again,
you
read
language
against
certain
background
assumptions
and
norms
that
states
when
they're--
mr.
christopher
landau
--you
know,
and
the
truth
is,
your
honor,
i
think
it
still
wouldn't
matter
at
the
end
of
the
day.
i
think,
in
gasperini,
the
law
--
the
provision
of
the
cplr
in
gasperini
provided
for
heightened
review.
there
was
no
indication
that
that
applied
only
to
new
york
causes
of
action.
again,
it
may
be
one
clue,
but
it's
not
dispositive.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
your
honor,
if
new
york
decides,
for
substantive
reasons
--
and
we
are
talking
about
new
york
causes
of
action--
mr.
christopher
landau
--okay.
mr.
christopher
landau
right.
well
--
well,
new
york
--
yes,
that
new
york
can
make
a
decision
that
it
doesn't
want
certain
new
york
causes
of
action
to
be
brought
as
class
actions,
and
the
federal
courts--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
raise
some
interesting
questions
about
new
york's
power
to--
mr.
christopher
landau
--correct,
your
honor.
that's
right.
and,
again
--
and,
again--
mr.
christopher
landau
--absolutely.
mr.
christopher
landau
and
i
think
the
point
--
i
agree
100
percent.
i
think
the
point
that
you
are
--
that
point
underscores,
your
honor,
is
that,
ultimately,
the
erie
issue
is
a
federal
issue.
you
can
look
to
new
york
to
try
to
understand
the
design
and
operation
of
the
state
rule
at
issue,
but,
ultimately,
you
are
being
asked,
as
a
federal
court,
to
set
the
appropriate
relationship
between
the
state
court
system
and
the
federal
court
system.
and,
again,
the
lesson
of
erie
is
you
don't
want
to
create
incentives
that
will
bring
people
like
a
magnet
to
federal
court
and
distort
these
ex
ante
foreign
choices
of
litigants
for
state
law
claims.
mr.
christopher
landau
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
class
action
fairness
act,
on
its
face
--
and
the
legislative
history
actually
makes
this
point
explicit
--
it
had
no
intention
to
change
the
operation
of
the
erie
doctrine
in
class
actions.
and
so
there
is
nothing
in
the
class
action
fairness
act
that
changes
the
scope
of
rule
23.
again,
rule
23
just
doesn't
address
this
antecedent
issue.
it
assumes,
but
does
not
require,
that
you
have
a
cause
of
action
that
is
amenable
to
class
certification
in
the
first
place.
and
if
you
were
to
construe
rule
23
otherwise,
as
overriding
this
kind
of
statute
--
all
the
statutes
in
appendix
b,
that
would
be
a
truly
remarkably
substantive
interpretation
that
this
court
has
always
stressed,
that
it
must,
in
construing
the
rules,
be
careful
not
to
tread
into
that
territory
and
has
construed
the
rules
with
an
eye
towards
the
limitations
of
the
rules
enabling
act.
the
other
side
--
shady
grove
would
walk
you
right
into
an
extremely
problematic
situation
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
rules
enabling
act,
as
well
as
creating
these
--
these
incentives
that
really
go
against
the
heart
of
the
erie
doctrine
that
would
turn
a
$500
case
into
a
$5
million
case.
and
one
interesting
point,
i
think,
is
that
all
these
statutes
that
are
listed
in
our
appendix
b
that
limit
class
certification
for
particular
causes
of
action
--
under
their
theory
that
rule
23
requires
that
everything
be
amenable
to
class
certification,
those
would
all
be
out
the
window.
i
don't
think
counsel
really
wanted
to
admit
that
this
morning,
but
the
logic
of
their
theory
that
--
is
that
rule
23
governs
this
case
and
rule
23
requires
that
every
cause
of
action
that
comes
before
it
be
eligible
for
class
certification.
that
would
knock
out
each
and
every
one
of
the
statutes
in
appendix
b.
they
don't
live
up
to
--
in
their
reply
brief,
at
footnote
10,
on
page
15,
they
try
to
distinguish
those
statutes
by
saying,
ah,
well,
the
limitation
on
class
actions
in
those
statutes
is
in
the
substantive
cause
of
action.
it's
not
in
--
it's
not
somewhere
else
in
the
code,
but
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
save
their
argument
under
rule
23.
they
really
can't
square
that
with
their
--
their
core
position
that
rule
23
itself
answers
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
and,
again,
what
we
would
ask
the
court
is
just
to
--
is
to
recognize
that
rule
23
occupies
the
ground
it
occupies,
but
it
doesn't
go
--
it
occupies
the
ground
of
the
criteria,
which
go
to
the
efficiency
and
fairness
of
the
process.
but
where
a
state
has
made
an
antecedent
decision
that
--
that
a
particular
cause
of
action
or
a
particular
remedy
is
categorically
unavailable
--
or
ineligible
for
class
certification,
that's
a
decision
that
federal
courts
should
respect
under
the
erie
doctrine.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
see
my
time
is
about
to
expire.
mr.
christopher
landau
thank
you,
chief
justice.
