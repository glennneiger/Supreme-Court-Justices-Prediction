justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
the
average
person
hearing
this
warning
would
envision
the
sort
of
procedure
that
occurs
before
a
grand
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
what
it
would
be
taken
to
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
warning
is
read
the
way
we
might
--
lawyers
might
read
a
statute
or
a
contract
or
something
like
that,
then
i
don't
know
why
saying,
"you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
"
isn't
potentially
misleading.
it
says
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
but
once
you
break
your
silence,
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
says
you
have
the
right
to
resume
your
silence.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
is
defective,
too?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
once
you
break
your
--
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
but
once
you
break
that
right,
the
fact
that
you
have
that
right
to
use
that
right
to
remain
silent
in
the
future
doesn't
mean
you
can
stop
answering
questions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
said
that
the
average
person
wouldn't
take
this
warning
to
mean
--
to
--
wouldn't
envision
a
procedure
like
the
grand
jury
procedure.
what
does
it
mislead
the
average
person
to
think?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
latter
part
of
that
is
the
grand
jury
question.
you
have
a
right
to
consult
an
attorney,
but
you
don't
have
the
right
to
have
an
attorney
present.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
so
then
your
argument
is
that
this
--
that
what
--
what
a
normal
--
an
average
person
would
take
this
to
mean
is
that
you
--
you
can
talk
an
--
to
an
attorney
before
starting
to
answer
questions,
but
not
once
the
questioning
begins.
that's
what
you
take
it
to
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
all
of
those
people
are
lawyers,
and
lawyers
are
known
to
read
legal
documents
very
precisely.
the
average
person
may
read
them
very
differently.
