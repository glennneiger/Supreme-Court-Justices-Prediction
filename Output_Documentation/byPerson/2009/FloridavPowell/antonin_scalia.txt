justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
elected
judges,
the
florida
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
--
how
long
is
their
term?
there's
a
retention
election
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
4
years.
and
they'd
have
to
run
for
their
retention
election
on
the
ticket
that
"we've
expanded
miranda
for
florida
purposes.
"
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
told
them:
you
are
entitled
to
confer
with
counsel
before
answering
questions,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
that
--
wasn't
that
the
warning
given
--
given
in
this
case?
you
are
entitled
to
consult
counsel
before
answering
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
once
we
say
this
is
properly
given,
my
goodness,
here's
--
here's
an
instruction
approved
specifically
by
this
court.
i
mean,
i
think
they
should
use
that,
don't
you?
i
mean,
the
other
one
they
are
going
to
have
to
guess
about,
but
this
one
is
approved
in
a
case
involving
florida
by
this
court.
so
you
--
it's
pretty
attractive
to
use
that
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
say
it's
okay.
you
are
arguing
that
it's
perfectly
okay,
so
why
do
you
hesitate
when
you
are
asked,
you
know,
could
the
state
go
back
to
doing
it?
you
should
say,
yes,
of
course,
they
--
they
might;
we
don't
think
it's
likely,
but
they
might,
and
if
they
did,
it's
perfectly
okay.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
constitution
requires
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
miranda
supposedly
says
the
constitution
requires
this
warning,
and
if
the
warning
must
be
in
a
standard
form
that
everybody
uses,
the
constitution
must
require
a
standard
form
that
everybody
uses.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
set
forth
the
substance
of
what
had
to
be
conveyed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it
set
forth,
on
page
484,
its
belief
that
the
fbi
warning
adequately
conveyed
that
substance.
it
said
this
warning
is
consistent
with
our
opinion
today.
and
--
and
that
warning
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
want
to
read
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that's
so
much
worse
than
--
than--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
you
have
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
court
said
in
miranda--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
must
say
i
--
this
is
--
this
is
angels
dancing
on
the
head
of
a
pin.
you
want
us
to
believe
that
your
client,
who
decided
to
talk,
even
though
he
was
told
he
could
consult
an
attorney
before
any
question
was
asked,
and
he
could
consult
an
attorney
at
any
time
during
the
interview,
and
he
went
ahead
and
--
and
confessed
--
you
are
saying,
oh,
if
he
had
only
known.
oh,
if
i
knew
that
i
could
have
an
attorney
present
during
the
interview,
well,
that
would
have
been
a
different
kettle
of
fish
and
i
would
never
have
confessed.
i
mean,
doesn't
that
seem
to
you
quite
fantastic?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
curious:
when
this
goes
back
to
them,
do
you
think
they
can
deviate?
they
were
answering
a
certified
question,
which
was
simply
whether
this
--
this
warning
complied
with
miranda.
that
was
the
only
certified
question.
so
when
it
goes
back,
i
assume
they,
having
said
no,
will
now
have
to
say
yes.
can
they
go
on
and
say:
oh,
and
by
the
way,
even
though
it
doesn't
violate
miranda,
we
think
it
violates
the
state
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
wasn't
the
question
asked
of
them.
the
only
question
asked
of
them
was
whether
it
complied
with
miranda.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
question
asked:
does
the
failure
to
provide
express
advice
of
the
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel
during
questioning
vitiate
miranda
warnings?
okay?
that's
the
question.
they
have
a
footnote
after
miranda,
which
reads,
"miranda
v.
arizona,
384
u.s.
436.
"
i
take
that
to
mean
that
the
question
is
whether
this
warning
violated
miranda.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true,
but
--
but
if
they
--
if
they
felt
the
authority
to
go
beyond
miranda,
wouldn't
they
have
had
to
say
no
to
this
question,
if
we
find
that
way,
and
then
go
on
to
say:
but
it
does
violate
our
own?
and
that's
beyond
the
question
that
they
--
that
they
--
that
was
certified
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--sometimes,
a
little
knowledge
is
a
dangerous
thing.
