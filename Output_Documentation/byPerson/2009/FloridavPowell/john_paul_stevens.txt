justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
did
it
in
this
case,
didn't
they?
under
your
view,
they
--
their
ruling
goes
beyond
miranda,
and
they
said
that
the
florida
constitution
requires
this
result.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
did
do
it
in
this
very
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
also
cited
the
--
the
florida
constitution,
did
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
it
not
also
say
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
--
i
mean,
of
the
florida
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
isn't
it
the
case
that
this
particular
warning
is
used
in
one
judicial
district,
and
the
warning
that
was
approved
in
traylor
was
used
in
the
rest
of
the
state?
and
so
there
is
an
interest
--
the
florida
supreme
court
has,
in
effect,
required
the
same
warning
throughout
the
state.
and
if
you
prevail,
there
may
be
one
standard
warning
in
one
judicial
district,
and
the
other
districts
may
continue
to
use
the
one
they
have
used
in
the
past.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true,
but
if
you
--
if
they
all
followed
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case,
then
they
all
would
use
the
same
warning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
most
of
them
do
already.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
all,
but
some.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
o'neil,
isn't
one
of
the
problems
here
that
florida
had
two
different
printed
forms
before
this
case
arose,
and
that
florida
supreme
court
has
said
they'll
all
have
the
same
one
hereafter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
at
least
two
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
wiser
generally
to
have
the
same
form
used
throughout
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
while
you're
looking
at
whether
it
would
be
an
undue
burden
on
law
enforcement,
it
was
--
it
has
a
burden
that's
consistent
with
the
ones
that
miranda
required
expressly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say
when
you
were
inquiring,
as
you
were
at
that
part
of
the
opinion,
into
how
burdensome
it
would
be
on
law
enforcement
to
give
these
warnings--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
are
saying
the
burden
would
be
consistent
under
the
new
warnings
with
those
previously
given
by
the
fbi.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
really
not
--
that's
really
not
quite
accurate,
because
they
used
the
term
"miranda
warnings"
generically--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
opposed
to
a
category
of
warnings
which
are
required
by
both
the
federal
constitution
and
the
state
constitution,
and
they
said
it
violated
the
state
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
in
the
question
they
--
they
took.
