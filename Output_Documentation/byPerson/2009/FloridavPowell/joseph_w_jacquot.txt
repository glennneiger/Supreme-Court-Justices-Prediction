mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
courts
have
recognized,
miranda
warnings
protect
fifth
amendment
rights
and
promote
voluntary
confessions,
confessions
important
to
seeking
truth,
solving
crimes,
and
securing
justice.
yet
the
florida
supreme
court
erred
in
two
ways
to
suppress
a
voluntary
confession
relied
upon
for
kevin
powell's
conviction.
first,
the
florida
court
misapplied
the
analysis.
rather
than
evaluating
the
warning
under
a
reasonably
conveyed
standard
for
the
right
to
an
attorney,
the
court
strictly
parsed
the
warning,
seeking
certain
words
in
a
certain
order.
second,
the
court
incorrectly
found
the
warning
to
be
misleading.
the
court
ignored
the
totality
of
the
warning.
the
court
overemphasized
the
order
in
which
the
rights
were
given,
and
furthermore,
the
court
applied
a
hypertechnical
analysis
of
the
warning's
language.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
your
honor,
the
florida
court
theoretically
could,
but
the
florida
court
would
have
to
do
that
on
state
grounds,
and
in
this
case,
they
relied
on
federal
grounds
to
reach
this
decision--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--theoretically.
but
this
court
found
in
evans
v.
arizona
that
just
because
of
the
theoretical
possibility
that
a
court
could
write
its
opinion
differently
on
state
grounds,
this
court
still
had
jurisdiction
because
the
original
opinion
rested
on
federal
grounds.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--your
honor,
the
florida
supreme
court
members
are
first
appointed,
and
then
they
are
subsequently
elected.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
correct.
there
is
a
retention
election
every
4
years.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
well,
your
honor,
they
are
elected.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
no,
your
honor.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
possibility
is
there,
but
in
its
decisions
it
has
found
--
particularly
in
the
case
before
you--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--no,
justice--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--no,
justice
stevens.
the
court
specifically
relied
on
federal
law.
it
just
got
it
wrong.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
it
cited
the
florida
constitution--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--yes,
your
honor,
it
mentioned
the
florida
constitution.
however,
in
those
same
sentences,
it
interwove
federal
law.
it
would
say:
under
the
florida
constitution
and
according
to
miranda.
and
this
court
in
michigan
v.
long
has
found
that
opinions
that
interweave
state
and
federal
law
are
appropriate
for
this
court's
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
we
do
indeed,
your
honor.
the
florida
court
in
powell
read
the
warning
to
--
in
line
with
miranda.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
well,
your
honor,
the
past
cases
have
said
that
the
florida
court
could,
but
they
haven't.
and
in
this
case
they
particularly
did
not.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
well,
your
honor,
under
michigan
v.
long
the
test
is
to
look
at
the
clear
face
of
the
opinion,
to
look
for
a
plain
statement
that
this
case
relied
on
adequate
--
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds,
and
that
is
not
there.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
your
honor,
in
miranda
the
court
did
use
the
terms
"clearly
inform".
however,
this
court
has
gone
on
in
prysock
to
use
the
term
"adequately
inform"
and
duckworth
uses
the
word
"reasonably
convey".
so,
yes,
although
the
rights
are
consistent
from
miranda
on--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
this
court
has
said
that
clarity
is
judged
by
whether
the
warnings
reasonably
convey
the
rights
under
miranda;
that's
the
standard.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
warning
conveyed
only
the
right
to
attorney.
it
did
not
have
the
specific--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--correct.
but
on
the
right
to
attorney
warning
at
issue
here,
it
said
only
that
the
suspect
has
the
ability
to
consult
counsel.
it
did
not
go
into
the
specific
--
detail,
the
explicit
nature
of
spelling
out
the
terms
"present"
and
the
terms
"during"
that
the
florida
supreme
court
required.
and
that's
the
real
issue
here
before
the
court,
is
whether
the
florida
supreme
court
applied
a
standard
that
is
significantly
different
than
the
standard
that
this
court
has
required.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
what
warning,
justice
scalia?
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
yes,
the
warning
in
this
case
said
you
have
the
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
of
our
questions.
and,
furthermore--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
warning
said,
"you
have
the
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
of
our
questions.
"
and
then
the
warning
went
on
to
say,
"you
have
the
right
to
use
this
right
at
any
time
during
this
interview.
"
we
would
argue
that
this
expresses
all
the
rights
required
under
miranda.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
well,
your
honor,
the
standard
being
"reasonably
convey"--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--the
warning
lays
out
that
you
have
the
right--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--the
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
yes,
but
a
--
your
honor,
a
grand
jury
operates
very
differently
than
a
criminal
interrogation--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
would
have
three
responses
to
that.
first,
under
miranda
the
fbi
warning
did
not
use
the
terms
"present",
did
not
use
the
terms
"with
you",
and--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--correct.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
be
very
clear
and
answer
justice
breyer
with
the
three
points
i
began.
miranda
requires
that
law
enforcement
effectively
communicate
the
fact
that
you
can
access
your
right
to
an
attorney
present
and
during
an
interrogation.
however,
in
the
miranda
opinion
they
approvingly
cited
the
fbi
warning
that
only
had
the
terms
--
the
generalized
warning:
consult
with
counsel.
furthermore,
the
ability
to
talk
to
your
lawyer,
which
is
at
issue
in
this
warning,
is
the
first
natural
step
to
getting
your
attorney.
and,
third,
as
this
court
has
held
in
minnick,
that
it's
the
representation
that
matters
in
custodial
interrogations--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--your
honor,
the
current
fbi
warning
does
have
that.
however,
there
have
been
several
cases
in
the
circuits
that
have
held
generalized
warnings
to
be
sufficient,
warnings
that
say
only
the
right
to
an
attorney.
and
one
of
the
issues--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--correct,
your
honor.
and
--
and
that
is
the
issue,
is
what
is,
first,
the
standard
that
courts
must
currently
apply
in
terms
of
whether
a
warning
reasonably
conveys.
that
is
not
the
standard
of
analysis
that
the
florida
court
applied.
and
secondly,
when
evaluating
that
warning,
the
--
the
florida
court
incorrectly
finds
that
this
warning
was
misleading.
now--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--correct.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
your
honor,
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
florida
supreme
court's
explicit
standard
is
problematic.
first,
the
same
standard
applies
to
written
warnings
as
to
verbal
warnings.
so
you've
had
situations
where
you
have
a
law
enforcement
officer
who
doesn't
have
his
card
in
the
field;
there's
a
verbal
error;
there's
an
inconsistency
in
translations.
if
a
suspect
is
asking
questions
trying
to
get
clarity,
the
law
enforcement
officer
is
going
outside
of
the
card
to
provide
that
clarity.
those
are
situations
that
may
not
meet
the
explicit
express
advice
standard
of
the
court.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
tampa
police,
in
having
this
warning
drafted,
is
attempting
to
reasonably
convey
the
warning,
and
there
is
good
public
policy
reasons
why.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
well,
your
honor,
we
would
claim
that
this
warning
falls
within
the
97
percent
cited
by
amici
because
it
has
the
word
"during"
in
the
warning.
the
florida
court
ignored
the
totality
of
the
warning.
it
chose
to
place
the
order
of
the
warning's
rights
in
a
way
that
this
court
in
prysock
and
duckworth
has
found
is
not
the
proper
analysis.
furthermore,
this
court
used
a
hypertechnical
approach.
it
took
the
words
"before
answering
any
of
our
questions.
"
turned
that
into
an
exclusive
statement
to
say,
"only
before
questioning"
and
then,
as
a
result
of
that,
attempted
to
discount
the
last
sentence
of
the
warning.
that's
the
kind
of
parsing,
that's
the
kind
of
precise
formulation,
that's
the
kind
of
construing
warnings
like
a
will
or
defining
terms
like
an
easement
that
this
court
has
rejected.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
your
honor,
you
are
correct,
in
that
tampa
has
a
new
form
now
that
does
have
the
words
"present"
and
"during"
in
a
different
formulation.
however,
there's
no
indication
that
they
would
go
back
to
the
other
form,
for
several
reasons.
one,
law
enforcement
has
an
incentive
to
have
miranda
rights
properly
given
because
they
desire
there
to
be
confessions
and
for
those
confessions
to
be
admissible--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--well,
your
honor,
law
enforcement
agencies
will
look
to
courts
for
approval
of
this
--
of
their
warnings.
the
warning
at
issue
in
powell--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--well,
justice
scalia,
as
a--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--justice
scalia,
they
theoretically
could,
because
the
warning
was
reasonably
conveyed.
it
was
sufficient.
however,
it's
unlikely
they
would.
law
enforcement
agencies
modify
their
warnings
when
they
become
issue.
so
when
a
litigation
begins
on
a
warning,
they
often
modify
it
at
that
point--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--well,
justice
stevens,
it
is
not
true
that
every
jurisdiction
in
florida
uses
this
same
warning.
there
are
varieties
of
warnings.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
well,
justice
stevens,
if
they
were
all
following
the
florida
supreme
court
here,
they
would
have
to
explicitly
state
certain
terms
in
their
warning.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
well,
not
necessarily.
in--
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
--some
--
some
do,
some
do
not,
and
one
of
the
fears
in
having
an
express
advice
standard
is
that
you
will
have
continuing
terms
that
are
required.
for
instance,
the
term
30
of
90
jurisdictions
in
florida.
there
is
nothing
to
stop
the
florida
supreme
court,
if
this
court
was
to
allow
an
express
advice
standard,
from
then
requiring
the
term
"before
questioning"
in
addition.
that's
the
kind
of
danger
in
having
an
analysis
that
is
much
stricter,
that
essentially
looks
at
words
that
should
be
in
a
warning,
rather
than
looking
at
whether
the
right
to
attorney
is
reasonably
conveyed
to
the
suspect.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
w.
jacquot
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
make
three
brief
points,
after
responding
to
a
question
that
justice
stevens
asked.
in
terms
of
independent
and
adequate
state
grounds,
in
our
brief,
we
relied
on
the
florida
court
citing
miranda,
the
case,
not
miranda,
as
the
phraseology,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
interwove
the
federal
law
based
on
miranda,
the
case
itself,
and
there
is
no
plain
statement
to
the
otherwise.
three
quick
points:
there
is
no
manipulation
behind
this
warning.
this
warning
is
the
result
of
litigation
in
thompson
v.
state.
that
was
a
1991
decision
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
--
the
tampa
police
had
changed
its
warning.
the
previous
warning
had
148
words.
this
warning
is
simpler,
with
79
words.
the
previous
warning
had
arcane
and
redundant
language.
this
language
is
more
straightforward.
those
are
the
reasons
behind
the
change
in
the
warning,
not
any
kind
of
inference,
as
amici
makes,
towards
manipulation.
second,
what
respondent
is
asking
for
is
exactly
what
this
court
chose
not
to
do
in
prysock.
it
told
the--
