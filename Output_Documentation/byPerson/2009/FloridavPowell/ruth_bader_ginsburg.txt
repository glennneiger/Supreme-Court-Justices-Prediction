justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
agree
that
it
--
suppose
we
accept
your
position
and
the
case
is
remanded.
the
florida
supreme
court
could
say:
well,
that's
very
nice,
but
we
have
a
florida
constitution
with
a
counterpart
to
the
fifth
amendment,
so
we're
just
going
to
have
the
same
opinion,
but
we
are
putting
it
under
--
squarely
under
the
florida
constitution.
they
could
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
that's
what
i
meant.
they
could
do
it
on
state
grounds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
miranda
itself
--
i
mean,
it
set
out
the
four
requirements,
but
there
was
a
charge
--
i
mean
there
was
a
warning
involved,
am
i
not
right?
well,
didn't
they
cite
the
then-fbi
warning?
it
has
been
improved
considerably,
but
there
was
an
fbi
warning
cited
in
miranda
itself,
was
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
also
said
you
have
a
right
to
keep
silent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
--
it
used
it
in
determining
--
in
--
in
stating
the
obligation
of
the
state,
but
it
didn't
use
those
words
in
setting
out
the
warning
that
the
fbi
then
gave.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
said,
this
is
what
--
states,
this
is
what
your
obligation
is,
what
you
must
say
to
the
defendant
is.
and
i
think
the
florida
court
is
the
same
way.
it
said:
you
are
entitled
to
the
help
of
a
lawyer.
then
it
spells
it
out
in
that
opinion,
but
--
but
what
it
said
had
to
be
communicated
was
not
the
--
the
full
range.
just
you're
entitled,
i
think
it
was,
to
the
help
of
a
lawyer.
so
there's
--
there's
a
confusion,
i
think,
between
what
miranda
spells
out
and
many
other
cases
spell
out
as
the
state's
obligation,
what
the
state
must
do,
and
the
statement
that
must
be
made
to
the
defendant
to
communicate
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
warning
that
justice
breyer
has
just
referred
to
--
that's
long
after
miranda
itself,
and
it
was
not
the
warning
that
the
fbi
gave
at
the
time
of
miranda.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
danger
that
tampa,
if
you
should
prevail,
will
go
back
to
the
old
way?
now,
it
has
a
clearer
form
--
whether
this
form
was
adequate
is
one
thing.
but
now,
it
has
the
form
that
the
--
like
the
one
the
fbi
currently
uses.
if
you
prevail,
then
tampa
can
go
back
to
what
it
had
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
about
the
reasonable
defendant
in
this
very
case?
powell's
lawyer
questioned
him
and
asked
him:
"you
waived
the
right
to
have
an
attorney
present
during
your
questioning
by
the
detectives?
"
answer:
"yes".
this
is
at
appendix
page
80.
so,
apparently,
counsel
understood
the
warning
to
have
conveyed
the
right
to
have
an
attorney
present
during
questioning
by
the
--
by
the
detectives.
counsel
understood
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
she
ever--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
she
asking
her
client
a
legal
question?
you
waived
the
right
to
have
an
attorney
present
during
your
questioning
by
detectives,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
think
that
a
suspect
would
think,
now,
i'm
in
this
custodial
room,
they
want
me
to
stay
put,
that
they're
going
to
have
me
hopping
in
and
out
of
the
room
to
talk
to
my
lawyer?
wouldn't
the
assumption
be,
i'm
stuck
in
this
room,
they
are
holding
me
here,
and
if
i
have
a
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer,
it's
got
to
be
there
and
not
my
walking
in
and
out
of
the
holding
room.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
the
--
the
court's
decisions
in
prysock
and
duckworth
that
dealt
with
the
right
to
appointed
counsel
and
the
suspect
was
not
explicitly
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
appointed
counsel
at
the
pre-arraignment
stage.
it
said
something
about
a
court
would
give
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
wouldn't
have
to
have
any
additional
information;
you
just
tell
them,
you
have
a
right
to
have
a
--
have
counsel
now.
that
would
be
fewer
words.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
one
of
them
say
"court",
and
the
suspect
was
not
in
court
at
the
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
that
the
court
will
appoint
counsel
for
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
are
--
they
are
free
to
do
that.
i
mean,
politically,
they
might
consider
it
risky,
but
if
we
say
that
the
charge
was
good
enough,
the
florida
court
could
say,
but
it's
not
good
enough
under
our
constitution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they
did
say
over
and
over
again
--
one
was
the
certified
question;
another
was
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
failure
to
provide
express
advice
of
the
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel
during
custodial
interrogation
violates
the
principles
espoused
in
miranda,
with
the
citation.
i
mean,
they
said
many,
many
times
that
the
question
was
--
what
did
miranda
mean
was
the
issue,
not
what
--
what
did
florida's
extension
of
miranda.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
would
have
had
a
much
weightier
argument
if
it
hadn't
been
for
michigan
v.
long.
if
you
could
have
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
could
have
then
remanded
to
ask
the
florida
supreme
court:
was
it
independently
ruling
under
its
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
miranda
against
arizona,
this
court
held
that
before
police
question
a
suspect
in
custody
they
must
clearly
inform
him
of
his
rights.
this
now
familiar
miranda
warnings
include
advice
of
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present
during
interrogation.
in
this
case,
tampa
police
arrested
kevin
powell
and
read
him
the
standard
miranda
form.
among
other
warnings,
the
police
told
powell
he
had
the
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
before
answering
any
of
their
questions
and
the
rights
to
use
any
of
his
rights
at
any
time
during
the
interview.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
this
advice
inadequate.
the
right
to
counsel
warning
was
misleading
the
court
believed
because
it
suggested
powell
could
talk
to
an
attorney
only
before
the
police
started
to
question
him
and
did
not
convey
that
the
lawyer
could
be
present
throughout
the
interrogation.
we
reverse.
our
opinion
first
confirms
that
we
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
case.
powell
argued
that
we
lack
jurisdiction
because
the
florida
supreme
court
relied
on
the
state's
constitution
in
addition
to
miranda,
hence
the
decision
rested
on
inadequate
and
independent
state
ground.
this
court's
decision
in
michigan
v.
long
councils
otherwise.
when
a
state
court
decision
appears
to
rest
primarily
on
federal
law
and
the
independence
of
any
state
law
ground
is
not
clear
from
the
face
of
the
opinion,
michigan
v.
long
requires
the
court
to
presume
that
federal
law
controls
the
outcome.
here
the
florida
high
court's
opinion
consistently
trained
on
what
miranda
demands
rather
than
on
what
florida
law
independently
requires.
thus
no
alternative
state
grounds
impedes
our
jurisdiction.
on
the
merits
we
hold
that
the
advice
how
received
satisfies
miranda.
by
telling
powell
he
could
talk
to
an
attorney
before
answering
any
of
their
questions,
the
tampa
police
communicated
that
he
could
consult
with
a
lawyer
before
responding
to
any
particular
question
and
the
statement
that
powell
could
invoke
this
right
at
any
time
during
the
interview
confirms
that
he
could
exercise
his
right
to
counsel
while
the
interrogation
was
underway.
in
combination
of
these
two
warnings,
reasonably
conveyed
powell's
right
to
have
an
attorney
present
at
all
times.
to
reduce
the
risk
that
a
court
would
later
find
miranda
advice
inadequate,
it
is
in
law
enforcement
only
interest
to
state
warnings
with
maximum
clarity.
the
fbi
standard
miranda
warnings
are
exemplary
on
the
right
to
counsel.
the
fbi
inform
suspects,
you
have
a
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
or
advice
before
we
ask
you
any
questions,
you
have
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
with
you
during
questioning.
different
words
were
used
in
the
advice
powell
received,
but
they
communicated
the
same
essential
message.
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
joins
in
part.
