justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
right
in
miranda
that
says
--
in
miranda
--
"we
hold
an
individual
held
for
interrogation
must
be
clearly
informed
that
he
has
the
right
to
consult
with
the
lawyer
and
to
have
the
lawyer
with
him
during
interrogation.
"
okay?
where
does
it
say
that?
interpret
it
any
way
you
want.
you
know,
we
are
used
to
grand
juries.
in
a
grand
jury,
he
can
go
consult
with
a
lawyer,
but
he
doesn't
have
the
lawyer
with
him.
so,
where
does
it
tell
him
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
asking
you
to
point
to
the
words
that
tell
him
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
have
you
a
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
at
a
grand
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
correct.
and
so
aren't
you
supposed
to
tell
this
person,
that
unlike
a
grand
jury,
you
have
a
right
to
have
the
lawyer
with
you
during
interrogation?
i
mean,
it
isn't
as
if
that
was
said
in
passing
in
miranda.
they
wrote
eight
paragraphs
about
it.
and
i
just
wonder,
where
does
it
say
in
this
warning
you
have
the
right
to
have
the
lawyer
with
you
during
the
interrogation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"present",
miranda?
it
says
right
here:
"we
hold"
--
it
says
--
"not
just
prior
to
questioning,
but
also
to
have
counsel
present
during
any
questioning.
"
that's
what
miranda
says.
and
then
miranda,
after
discussing
it
for
five
pages,
goes
on
to
use
the
words
i
just
said.
you
have
to
tell
him
he
has
the
right
to
have
counsel
with
him.
so
it
does
use
the
word
"present".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
fbi
are
we
talking
about?
because
the
fbi
advice
of
rights
says:
"you
have
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
with
you
during
questioning.
"
were
they
--
and
--
and
i
was
taken
by
the
fact,
"we
hold
that
an
individual
must
be
clearly
informed.
"
and
so,
is
there
some
other
case
that
says
--
or
some
other
fbi
statement
that
they
give
people
that
doesn't
use
the
words
"with
you",
that
says
you
don't
have
to
say
"with
you
during",
or
doesn't
have
to
say
"present
during"?
was
there
some
other
case
that
said
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excuse
me.
can
you
just
devote
one
minute
before
you
finish--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
the
question
of
why
these
are
adequate?
if
you
remember
my
question,
i
tried
to
explain
why
i
thought
they
might
not
be
adequate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
were
four.
one
is
to
have
during,
in
the
presence
of,
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
during
the
interrogation,
in
the
presence
of,
with
him
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
one
of
the
four.
that's
one
of
the
things
they
devote
two
pages
to
miranda,
and
they
repeat
it
when
they
summarize
what
you
have
to
say.
i
just
want
to
know
where
in
this
statement
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
i
guess
anybody
who
has
had
prior
experience
with
the
law,
as
this
man
might
have
done,
might
be
familiar
with
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
but
i
tell
you:
here's
your
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
before
questioning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
then
repeat,
you
can
assert
that
right
whenever
you
want,
to
talk
to
him
before
questioning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
my
question
is,
how
does
that
tell
him
he
has
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
with
him
during
questioning,
that
the
questioning
he
has
a
right
to
have
take
place
from
beginning
to
end
in
the
presence
of
a
lawyer,
a
matter
that
the
miranda
court
repeated
three
times
in
the
summary
and
wrote
eight
full
paragraphs
about
why
that
was
important?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
it
approves
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wasn't
though,
actually.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
consistent
with
it.
that's
interesting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
say
anything
about
during.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
anyway
--
then
they
don't
need
to
mention
fbi
warning
at
that
time,
j.
edgar
hoover's
letter
or
whatever
it
was,
just
talked
about
telling
you,
you
have
a
right
to
counsel.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
"during".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
you
think
that,
in
fact,
going
by
that
warning,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
have
them
say
a
word
about
during.
this
would
be
okay
if
they
said
nothing
at
all
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
--
is
there
since
then
--
i
mean,
as
i
read
it
now
i
see
that,
as
i
said,
it
seems
very
clear
that
they
intend
you
to
have
to
say
that
the
counsel
has
to
be
--
is
present
with
you.
present,
okay?
now
the
fbi
warnings,
which
they
did
say
is
consistent,
don't
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
since
the
time
of
miranda,
has
this
court
ever
talked
about
that?
has
there
been
any
lower
court
or
have
there
been
--
has
the
practice
of
the
departments
to
any
great
extent
been
such
that
they
stopped
talking,
or
did
not
talk,
or
never
spoke
about
a
right
to
have
a
counsel
with
you
during
--
during
--
"during"
just
dropped
out.
they
just
said
forget
about
"during".
it
wasn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
court
has
referred
to
"during".
