justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
--
has
the
florida
supreme
court
ever
explicitly
interpreted
--
what
is
it?
article
i,
section
8,
of
the
florida
constitution
more
expansively
than
--
and
explicitly
so
--
and
explicitly
so,
than
miranda?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
case
has
to
be
that,
if
we
adopt
the
petitioner's
petition,
it's
perfectly
fine
for
every
jurisdiction
in
the
country
to
use
this
warning,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
every
jurisdiction
in
the
country
can
use
it,
so
we
can
--
we
can
talk
about
whether
or
not
it's
adequate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
you
think
lack
of
uniformity
is
a
good
idea?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
us
where
that
is?
i
think
you
mean
page
479,
but
i'm
not
sure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
page
are
you
on
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
could
write
that
down.
it
could
be
the
next
case.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
case.
the
remand
in
long
was
only
to
address
another
issue.
the
long
court
took
its
determination
as
being
binding
on
the
issue
that
was
before
the
court
in
long--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
that
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
each
time,
it
said
that
it
was
by
extension
from
miranda.
it
always
linked
it,
and
that
was
the
question
that
was
presented
in
the
state
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
it
certified.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
whole
reason
we
have
jurisdiction,
so
that
miranda
will
not
be
confused,
and
so
that
it
won't
be
a
hazard
on
the
landscape
when
people
say
"miranda"
and
they
mean
something
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
the
washington
--
that
the
florida
supreme
court
could
in
this
case
go
back
to
the
constitution.
that's
--
you
can't
get
that
out
of
long.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
--
maybe
in
some
other
case.
not
necessarily
in
this
one,
because
long
leads
to
--
to
the
contrary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
no
case
in
which
the
florida
supreme
court
has
explicitly
said
that
we
have
a
warning
that
is
more
strict,
more
rigorous
than
what
miranda
requires?
you
have
no
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
the
words
that
it
quoted
from
the
lower
court
opinion
--
that
is,
we
are
talking
about
the
--
the
fifth
amendment,
and
by
extension,
article
i,
section
9.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
it's
incorporating,
not
going
further.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
the
opposite.
i
think
the
repeated
linkage
shows
that
they
think
they
are
the
same.
