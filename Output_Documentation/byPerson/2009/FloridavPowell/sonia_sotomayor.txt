justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
of
your
amici
--
one
of
the
amici
suggested
that
the
florida
courts
cannot
read
the
florida
constitution
more
expansively
than
the
federal
requirements.
are
you
rejecting
that
proposition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
it's
a
different
question.
one
of
the
amici
suggests
that
the
florida
constitution
and
florida
case
law
says
that
they
can't
read
the
florida
constitution
more
broadly
than
it
is
read
under
federal
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
this
could
be
a
first,
if
we
were
to
start
from
the
proposition
that
justice
ginsburg
did?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
--
do
you
see
a
conflict
between
the
language
of
our
decisions
where
we
often
say
that
miranda
rights
have
to
be
clear
and
those
decisions
that
say
that
whatever
is
said
has
to
reasonably
convey
the
essence
of
the
miranda
warnings?
is
there
a
difference
between
those
two
statements,
and
which
of
our
cases
or
statements
would
control?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
would
suggest
that
if
something
is
not
clear
and
it's
ambiguous,
that
that's
enough?
or
--
or
is
there
a
difference
between
reasonable
and
clarity?
that
has
to
be
read
in
a
certain
way;
otherwise
an
ambiguous
warning--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
have
a
difficulty
in
terms
of
this
argument
about
burdening
law
enforcement.
this
is
a
preprinted
form
that
the
police
made
up,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
added
burden
by
making
the
form
absolutely
and
abundantly
clear
or
conforming
the
form
to
the
statements
in
miranda?
what's
the
cost
to
the
state?
they're
going
to
print
the
form
anyway.
they
are
telling
their
officers
to
read
from
the
form
anyway.
what's
the
added
cost?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
there
is
a
question
about
how
much
the
subjective
intent
of
the
questioner
should
be
involved
in
this
process
or
not.
there
are
cases
where
it
appears
the
plurality
of
our
court
has
said
it
should
always
be
an
objective
standard,
and
others
where
certain
members
have
expressed
a
question
about
subjective.
but
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
printed
form,
why
wouldn't
the
intent
of
the
entity
at
issue
be
placed
in
question?
meaning,
you
could
have
--
the
police
here
could
have
chosen
to
be
explicit,
but
instead
they
chose
to
be
--
to
obfuscate
a
little
bit
and
be
less
explicit.
shouldn't
we
assume
that
that's
an
intent
to
deceive
or
perhaps
to
confuse?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why?
the
--
the
easy
solution
is
to
do
what
90
percent
of
the
jurisdictions
are
doing:
copy
miranda.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
that
justice
scalia
just
pointed
out,
if
we
approve
the
language
of
this,
then
--
of
this
particular
warning,
it
becomes
the
new
sort
of
floor.
and
if
we
make
it
the
new
floor,
it
--
doesn't
it
provide
an
incentive
for
police
departments
to
move
away
from
the
explicit
warnings
that
say
"during
and"
--
"before
and
during"
interrogations;
now
we're
saying
--
you
know,
generalize
them
more.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
aren't
we
encouraging
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
after
duckworth?
do
you
know?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we
don't
know
how
many--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
--
how
do
we
deal
with
the
fact
that,
if
the
purpose
of
miranda
is
to
give
clear
warnings,
and
your
adversary
says
--
not
your
adversary
--
your
co-counsel
--
petitioner's
counsel
says
that
means
--
"clear"
means
does
it
reasonably
convey?
we've
got
a
split
of
circuit
courts
and
state
courts
on
whether
this
reasonably
conveys
or
not.
shouldn't
that
be
enough
of
an
ambiguity
for
us
to
conclude
it
can't
reasonably
convey,
if
there's
this
many
courts
holding
that
it
doesn't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
calling
the
florida
state
supreme
court
majority
unreasonable
jurists?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
happens
now
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule,
and
--
but
this
was
the
rule,
meaning
this
was
the
form
that
they
were
reading.
and
if
it
has
some
significant
ambiguity
in
it,
sufficient
for
at
least
one
court
to
say
it
wasn't
sufficiently
clear,
it
wasn't
explicit
enough,
should
we
worry
about
the
exception
as
an
exception?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
so
i
get
the
bottom
line
--
if
all
this
warning
had
said
was,
you
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer
before
questioning--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer
before
questioning--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
would
be
your
position
that
standing
alone
that
would
be
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
bottom
line
in
my
mind
--
the
question
is,
whether
these
warnings
are
substantively
or
otherwise
different
than
the
fbi
warnings
that
some
believe
were
approved
in
miranda.
are
these
equivalent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
disagree
with
you,
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was,
did
the
fbi
warning
at
issue
or--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--not
at
issue
because
it
wasn't
at
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
was
reviewed
and
approved
in
miranda,
did
it
give
that--
