ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
clearly,
miranda
could
not
have
been
more
specific
when
it
said
an
individual
held
for
interrogation
must
be
clearly
informed
that
he
has
the
right
to
consult
with
a
lawyer
and
to
have
the
lawyer
with
him
during
interrogation.
that's--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--at
471.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
i
disagree
with
that
representation
that
it
was
approved
of.
what
this
court
said--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--consistent
with
is
not
the
same.
at
--
in
the
few
pages
beforehand,
the
court
specifically
set
forth
these
miranda
warnings
in
what
it
required,
including
the
presence
of
counsel--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--right.
correct,
at
page
479,
this
court
set
forth
the
warnings
that
it
wants
to
have
read
to
every--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--right.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
yes,
i
have
the
warning.
yes.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
yes,
i
can
read
it.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
the
--
the
warning
says
that
--
let's
see
--
at
the
--
at
the
outset
of
the
interview
that
he
is
not
required
to
make
a
statement,
that
any
statement
may
be
used
against
him
in
court,
and
that
the
individual
may
obtain
the
services
of
an
attorney
of
his
own
choice.
and,
more
recently,
that
he
has
the
right
to
free
counsel.
however,
the
purpose--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--yes,
and
the
purpose
of--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--of
saying
this
was
because
the
question
was,
is
this
going
to
be
burdensome
to
the
government,
to
the
police
to
issue
these
warden
--
these
warnings?
and
the
very
beginning
of
that
sentence,
right
before
they
said
it,
was
they
--
that
the
fbi
has
compiled--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--we
are
still
on
483.
we
are
in
the
sentence
right
above
it.
over
the
years
the
fbi
has
compiled
an
exemplary
record
of
effective
law
enforcement
while
advising
any
suspect
or
arrested
person
at
the
outset
of
the
interview
that
he
is
not
required
to
make
a
statement
--
and
then
i
just
read
it.
so,
the
--
that
was
to
counteract
whether
it
was
too
burdensome.
not
that
they
were
approving--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--consistent
with
but
not
identical.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
no,
i
--
in
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
this
court
went
a
little
further
and
required
the
presence
of
counsel.
and
then--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--it
doesn't
say
that
the
--
the
attorney
has
to
be
present
with--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--how
is
it
consistent?
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
it
--
because
it
--
it
gave
three
of
the
basic
--
you
know,
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
you
have
the
right
to
an
attorney,
the
services
of
an
attorney;
and
that
you
have
the
right
to
--
or
any
--
any
statement
you
make
will
be
used
against
you.
so
they
just
didn't
go
far
enough
in
the
fbi
warnings.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
it's
--
it's
consistent
to
a
point,
but
it--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--and
just
as
if
--
and
--
and
they
have
added
in,
more
recently,
the
right
to
free
counsel.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
i'm
sorry.
the--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--right.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
correct.
it's
--
it's
not
any
more
burdensome
by
adding
in
the
--
an
additional
requirement.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
uh-huh.
the
rights
of
the
individual,
right.
and
the
--
the
miranda
court
just
made
sure
that
they've
added
in
the
additional
requirement,
and
the
fbi
did
change
their
warnings,
and
has
continued
to
modify
and
change
their
warnings
to
be
consistent
with
miranda.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
i
don't
--
i
believe
that
--
that
requiring
the
presence
of
counsel
during
the
interrogation
goes
a
little
bit
--
a
lot
further.
and
it
--
it
is
not
equivalent
to
the
fbi.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
at
issue
in
miranda?
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
it
wasn't.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
no,
it
did
not.
and
that
why
--
and
that's
why
i
don't
believe
the
court
in
miranda
ever
said
we
--
it's
consistent
with,
but
they
never
said,
we
approve.
they
never
said,
we
are
adopting
that
language.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
no,
they
don't.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
they
do
not.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
no,
the
case
law
has
always
referred
to
both,
both
by
this
court
and
then
--
and
then
the
circuit
courts.
and
the--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--has
--
has
--
in
many
opinions,
it
talked
about
before
interrogation
and
during
interrogation
the
right
to
have
counsel
present.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
no,
your
honor,
especially
not
with
a
reasonable
suspect
that's
being
questioned.
there
--
there
--
we
are
not
talking
about
reasonable
lawyers
or
reasonable
justices;
we
are
talking
about--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--no,
counsel--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--never
--
never
asked
him
did
you
knowingly
waive;
did
you
intelligently
waive?
she
was
trying
to
set
up
the
fact
that
the
client
had
waived
his
rights
before
he
made
a
statement
in
order
to
get
to
his
--
his
argument
that
his
statements
were
coerced.
but
she
was
never
giving
up
the
argument
that
she
had
made
previously
to
that
--
that
testimony
that
--
that
the
waiver
was
knowing
and
intelligent.
she
just
had
already
lost
that
argument
in
front
of
the
judge,
and
now
she
was
addressing
the
jury.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
yes.
well,
he
did
waive
his
rights,
but
he
didn't
knowingly
and
intelligently
waive
his
rights,
and
he
did
sign
the
form.
because
that
was
the
next
question:
did
you
sign
the
form?
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
i
don't--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--i
--
i
don't
think
most
--
most
people
have
been
in
front
of
a
grand
jury,
so
i
don't
envision
that
they
would
have
that
kind
of
reaction.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
i
think
they
would
focus
on
the
"before".
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
and
a
right
--
but
they
never
told
him
that
he'd
have
the
ability
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
during
the
interrogation.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
it's
--
it's
hard
for
us
to
be
able
to
delve
into
the
minds
of
the
tampa
police
department
and
the
people
who
create
these
forms.
however,
in
the
thompson
case,
which
is
before
you
in
the
briefs,
in
1984,
they
had
it
right.
they
said
you
have
the
right
to
talk
to
an
attorney
beforehand
and
to
the
presence
of
an
attorney
during
interrogation.
this
was
in
a
death
case,
and
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
right
to
free
counsel.
they
either
didn't
give
it
to
them
or
not.
so
why
they
went
and
changed
the
part
to
the
right
to
an
attorney
before
--
before
the
questioning,
and
then
during
questioning,
we
don't
know.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
well,
professor
leo
could,
and
there
is
a
memo
he
attaches
at
the
end
of
his
appendix
in
the
amicus
brief,
but
i
--
i
would
just
say
that
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
the
motives
are,
and
that
it
all
depends
on
how
the
defendant
or
the
person
in
custody
is
--
is
perceiving
these
warnings
and
whether
he's
getting
the
information
he
or
she
needs
to
be--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--right.
the
--
the
language
in
those
cases
had
something
to
do
with
--
you
know,
the
idea
being
that,
it
was
almost
informational
--
too
much
information,
additional
information
as
to
when
you're
going
to
get
your
counsel.
but
the
four
core--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--well,
they
--
in
prysock
it
was
a
matter
of
the
order,
but
in
duckworth
it
was,
we
can't
get
one
for
you
at
this
moment
kind
of
thing.
and
no
state
is
obligated
--
or
agency
--
to
provide
counsel
on
demand.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
was
not
in
court?
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
right.
and
that
would
be
sometime
in
the
future.
but
--
but
they
did
--
but
they
did
tell
them
that
if
you're
going
--
if
you're
going
to
be
questioned,
you
have
the
right
to
counsel
with
you
at
that
time.
and
that
was
the
important
thing.
even
if
we
had
to
wait,
they
couldn't
question
him
until
he
had
his
attorney
with
him.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
no.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
except
for
that
--
that
catch-all
phrase
that
they
used
at
the
bottom,
which
is
you
have
the
right
to
use
any
of
these
at
any
time.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
well,
i
think
that
it
--
it's
probably
okay
as
far
as
reinforcing
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
informing
him
that
any
of
your
answers
can
be
used
against
you,
but
i
don't
think
it
salvages
a
right
that's
not
there,
which
is
the
right
to
presence
during
interrogation.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
well,
the
--
the
catch-all
phrase
might
inform
them
that
they
could
stop,
but,
clearly,
if
they
had
the
right
to
presence
of
counsel
with
them,
that
might--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--right.
and
i
do
--
i
also
contest
the
language
that
the
opposing
counsel
uses
that
says
that
we
have
somehow
locked
in
everybody
with
--
with
what
the
--
what
the
decision
below
said.
the
decision
below
held
that,
and
i
quote
at
541,
"we
hold
that
powell
should
have
been
clearly
informed
of
his
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel
during
the
custodial
interrogation.
"
it's
not
magic
language.
it's
not
so
--
so
written
in
stone
that
--
it's
not
explicit
language.
there's
--
there's
--
this
language
follows
what
this
--
this
court
has
said.
the
reasonable
language,
the
clearly
informed
language.
it
isn't
locking
everyone
into
these
exact
words
down
the
line.
and
there
are
hundreds
of
ways
that
this
could
be
said.
so
--
and
then
the
court
noted
that
the
catch-all
phrase
did
not
effectively
convey
to
mr.
powell
his
rights
to
presence
before
and
during
and
that
the
last
sentence
could
not
effectively
convey
a
right
that
he
was
never
told
he
had.
as
far
as
whether
or
not
this
case
should
even
be
here,
even
though
the
florida
constitution
and
the
florida
court
has
gone
along
the
same
road,
traveled
a
parallel
road
with
this
court,
and
it
hasn't
seen
a
need
to
deviate,
they
--
they
may
see
a
need
to
deviate
here,
should
this
court
disagree
with
what--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--correct.
and
--
and
i
believe
they
would.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
well--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--the
florida
supreme
court
must
have
referred
to
its
constitutional
provision,
article
i,
section
9,
at
least
five
times.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
right.
and
the--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--it's
almost
like
miranda
is
being
used
as
a
generic
concept
for
warnings
--
you
know,
we're
complying
with
miranda--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--right,
but
--
you
know--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--you
can't
go
lower
than
the
federal
constitution,
but
they
can
give
more
rights.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
well,
in
--
in
traylor,
which
is
the
court
that
--
it's
the
case
that
the
--
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
decision
below
relied
heavily
upon,
they
said
that
we
are
the
ceiling
and
the
court
is
the
bottom,
and--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--no,
and
they
--
they
didn't
feel
like
they
had
to
--
to
deviate,
because
they
felt
like
their
definition
of
presence
of
counsel,
which
was
the
right
to
consult
with
an
attorney
before
and
the
right
to
have
counsel
present
during
the
interrogation,
was
consistent
with
the
holdings
in
miranda.
so
they
didn't
feel
the
need
to
deviate.
but
they
did
say
that
that
is
our
definition
as
we
set
forth
in
--
in
traylor,
and
that
is--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--i
believe
they
can,
because
as
long
as
they
are
not
going
below
what
this
court
mandates--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--if
they
provide
more
protections.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
right.
and
they--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--generically,
and--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--yes,
they
did.
and
they
did
--
they
did
say
we
have
our
standard
under
traylor,
that
we
defined
the
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel
or
to
the
help
of
counsel
as
requiring
presence
during,
as--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--right.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
well,
if
--
if--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--no.
no,
that's
not
in
the
question.
but
there
is
a
way
to
--
you
know,
they
repeated
all
along
the
way,
article
i,
section
9.
they
kept
repeating
it.
they
didn't
have
to.
if
they
were
just
going
to
say,
oh,
by
the
way,
our
constitution
goes
along
with
this,
they
could
have
said
it
in
passing.
they
could
have
also
said
that
we
--
we
choose
not
to
interpret
this
other
right.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
well
--
and,
again,
i
would
say
that
they
--
they
agree
that
we
are
traveling
along
the
same
road,
but
they
have
--
they
have
--
they
are
stressing
the
fact
that
they
have
set
a
line
in
the
sand
as
far
as
what
they're
interpreting
the
right
to
presence--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--and,
of
course,
if
they
did
violate
the
baseline,
the
minimum
standard
set
forth
in
miranda--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--then
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
so
--
which
is
why
traylor
and
the
florida
constitution
kept
making
--
because
they
didn't
have
to
really
get
to
what
the
bottom
or
the
baseline
or
the
minimum
standard
was,
as
long
as
florida
had
set
forth
a
standard--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--and
i
believe
the
idea
that
they
didn't
think
it
was
deviating
from
the
miranda
case.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
but
if
this
court
finds
that
it
does,
then
they
--
they
will
probably
--
and
i
feel
confident
that
they
would
fall
back
on
the
constitution
--
of
the
florida
constitution.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
well,
they
do
have
a
section
in
looking
at,
you
know,
other
circuit
courts
in
the
federal
system,
and
all
--
what
our
florida
courts
are
doing,
and
--
which
is
when
they
get
into
the
concept
of
--
well,
they
start
out
talking
about
traylor
and
our
constitution
at
the
beginning,
and
they
--
they
repeat
it
at
the
end
because
they
believe
it
is
consistent
with.
they
believe
it
is
following
along.
but
they
never
say
that
--
that
our
constitution
isn't
insignificant
or
that
it's
not
important.
if
they
did,
they
wouldn't
have
felt
the
need
to
cite
traylor.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
it
--
it
would
have
been
nice.
[laughter]
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
i
--
i
will
keep
that
in
mind.
[laughter]
the
--
the
idea
of
clear,
reasonably
clear
--
whichever
the
standard
is,
justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
the
florida
supreme
court
used
the
correct
standard
and
used
the
one
by
saying
that
it
was
clear
--
you
know,
whether
or
not
mr.
powell
was
clearly
informed.
so
no
matter
which
standard
you
use,
as
far
as
functionally
equivalent
or
whatever,
i
believe
that
this
falls
within
the
four
corners
of
that.
the
obligation
--
let's
see,
i'm
looking
to
see
what
other
cases
--
general
cases.
they
--
the
opposition
cites
to
the
fact
that
there's
this
great
conflict
going
on
among
the
circuits.
i
don't
believe
that
such
a
conflict
is
--
whatever
those
cases
were
deciding,
i
don't
believe
they
would
have
approved
of
this
language.
this
language,
because
of
the
"before"
limiting
language
and
excluding
the
"presence
during"
language,
became
misleading.
and
the
--
the
general
cases
that
like
--
just
the
plain
language,
you
have
the
right
to
the
presence
of
counsel,
they
--
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
--
with
what
florida
has
required.
they
--
they
would
not
disagree
that
there--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--that
he
--
that
once
questioning
starts,
that
he
--
he
has
no
right
to
consult
with
a
lawyer
anymore,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
--
and
tell
him
that
he
has
the
right
to
the
presence
of
an
attorney
with
him
in
an
interrogation
room,
where
the
coercion
takes
on
a
highly
new
meaning.
i
mean
the
coercive
practices
that
are
--
that
are--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
--
any
--
any
of
the
normal
reasonable
suspects
are
--
would
probably
be
even
aware
of
what
the
grand
jury
proceeding
was
about.
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
correct,
and
i'm
not
the
only
one.
there
were
five
supreme
court
justices,
a
majority
on
the
second
--
the
majority
of
the
second
district
judges
in
powell
and
seven
judges
on
the
second
district
level,
who
all
found
that
to
be
the
case,
and
we're
talking
someone
who
doesn't
have
that
level
of
intelligence.
and
he
may
have
had
a
prior
record
--
he
did
have
a
prior
record,
but
that
doesn't
mean--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--correct,
and
in
this
case--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--yes.
and
i
do
believe
that,
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
that
would
set
a
new
floor
for
these
forms
and
that
there
would
be
the
danger
of
the
fact
that
--
i
mean,
if
--
if
the
tampa
public
--
police
department
is
always
changing
its
forms
--
which
they
have
shown
to
be
the
case
--
they
have
changed
these
forms
in
the
past
--
why
wouldn't
other
agencies
decide
to
change
their
forms
and
make
things
more--
ms.
deborah
k.
brueckheimer
--i
--
i
--
yes.
i
do
believe
that,
when
they
changed
the
form
to
comply
with
the
decision
below
and
with
what's
going
on
in
97
percent
--
or
96
percent
of
the
jurisdictions
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
exact
language;
it
just
has
to
be
there.
then
--
then
the
--
then
the
system
runs
beautifully.
i
can't
tell
you
the
last
time
i
had
a
miranda
warning
case,
and
i
have
been
doing
this
for
almost
30
years.
there
is
no
litigation
when
it's
done
correctly,
and
it's
mostly
done
correctly.
thank
you.
