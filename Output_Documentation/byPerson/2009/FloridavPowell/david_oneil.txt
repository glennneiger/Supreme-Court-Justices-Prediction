mr.
david
o'neil
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
go
directly
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
what
would
happen
if
this
court
affirmed
the
warnings
in
this
case,
and
i
think
respondent's
amici
make
the
argument
that
it
will
somehow
promote
a
race
to
the
bottom.
and
i
think
that
history
and
experience
are
the
best
answer
to
that
question.
respondent's
amici,
who
have
carefully
studied
this
issue,
have
found
that
some
police
officers
have
attempted
to
evade
miranda
by
interrogation
techniques,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
police
have
tried
to
accomplish
that
purpose
by
changing
the
language
of
the
warnings,
and
that
is
not
because
they
couldn't
do
so.
for
the
last
20
years,
duckworth
and
prysock
have
been
on
the
books,
and
have
made
clear
that
no
standard
formulation
of
the
warnings
is
necessary
and
that
variant
warnings
will
be
upheld.
and
if
it
were
true--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
justice--
mr.
david
o'neil
--justice
sotomayor,
i
have
two
responses
to
that:
the
first
is
that
this
court
upheld
the
warning
in
duckworth,
which
said,
we
have
no
way
of
providing
you
an
attorney,
but
one
will
be
provided
if
and
when
you
go
to
court.
now,
if
you
--
if
it
were
true
that
police
were
looking
for
every
way
to
get
around
the
warnings
and
if
changing
the
warnings
were
an
effective
way
to
do
that,
we
should
have
seen
every
jurisdiction
adopt
those
warnings.
in
fact,
of
the
900
warnings
that
are
included
in
the
survey
that
respondent
relies
heavily
on,
only
5
have
that
formulation.
second,
four
circuit
courts
have
held--
mr.
david
o'neil
--i
don't
--
it
doesn't
indicate
when
they
were
adopted,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that,
if
police
did
have
that
incentive,
that
we
would
have
seen
at
least
some
jurisdictions
adopt
that
warning.
mr.
david
o'neil
we
agree
that
this
warning
is
adequate,
and
our
position
is--
mr.
david
o'neil
--they
can,
and
we
think
that's
unlikely,
and
if
the
concern
here
is
that
it
will
destroy
the
uniformity
that
the
federal
government
thinks
is
a
good
thing
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we
think
that
that
concern
is
simply
not
warranted.
but,
yes,
we
do
agree
that
these
warnings
adequately
convey
the
substance--
mr.
david
o'neil
--no,
we
think
that
affirming
these
warnings
will
not
disrupt
the
uniformity
that
seems
to
be
in
place
around
the
country,
and
--
for
exactly
the
reason
that
i
said,
justice
kennedy,
because
justice
sotomayor
mentioned
general
right
to
counsel
warnings,
that
if
we
upheld
a
general
right
to
counsel
warning,
that
jurisdictions
would
begin
to
drop
the
more
specific
language
that's
contained,
for
example,
in
the
fbi
form.
well--
mr.
david
o'neil
--i
don't
believe
the
fbi
form
is
set
out
in
full.
it's
on
pages
383
and
384
of
miranda,
and
the
description
of
the
court's
discussion
is
on
page
29
of
our
brief.
and
i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
it's
significant
that
four
circuit
courts
have
upheld
general
right
to
counsel
warnings
of
the
kind
that
were
in
the
fbi
warnings
in
1966.
but
the
police
departments
in
those
jurisdictions
have
not
abandoned
the
more
specific
language
that
is
contained
in
the
fbi
formulation.
in
new
york
city,
the
second
circuit
has
held
in
lamia--
mr.
david
o'neil
--no,
justice
sotomayor.
this
is
not
like
a
qualified
immunity
inquiry,
where
grounds
for
debate
among
reasonable
jurists
would
invalidate
the
warning.
mr.
david
o'neil
no,
i
think
--
i
think
the
problem
with
a
standard
that
permits
of
no
ambiguity
is
that,
as
florida
just
said,
this
standard
will
apply,
not
just
to
printed
forms
--
and
it
is
easy
enough
to
create
a
printed
form
in
advance
that
includes
more
specific
language
--
but
it
will
also
apply
to
inadvertent
departures
from
the
standard
forms
as
a
result
of
mistake.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
exception
is
--
needs
to
be
captured
within
the
rule
that
this
court
adopts
as
--
as
the
standard.
i
--
i
also
think
that
it
--
it
is
--
it's
simply
not
the
case
that
if
this
court,
as
i
said,
adopts
a
standard
that
permits
a
less
explicit,
less
precise
warning
than
the
fbi
wants--
mr.
david
o'neil
--justice
stevens,
i'm
not
aware
that
florida
had
two
printed
forms.
i
mean,
each
jurisdiction
used
its
own
form,
and
this
was
the
form
that
was
in
place--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
every
jurisdiction
adopts
a
slightly--
mr.
david
o'neil
--it
is.
the
government
believes
it
is
wiser
to
do
that,
and
the
federal
law
enforcement
agencies
do
that
because
it
avoids--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
no,
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
precise
words
of
miranda.
mr.
david
o'neil
nowhere
in
miranda
does
it
say
that
a
--
a
standard
form
is
necessary,
and
this
court
summarily
rejected
exactly
that
argument.
mr.
david
o'neil
yes.
mr.
david
o'neil
justice
breyer,
these
warnings
state
three
rights:
the
right--
mr.
david
o'neil
--absolutely.
mr.
david
o'neil
justice
breyer,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
a
suspect
who
hears
that
he
can
talk
to
an
attorney
before
answering
any
questions
and
during
this
interview
would
infer
the
unstated
restriction
that
he
can
talk
to
an
attorney
but
only
by
phone
or
only
remotely--
mr.
david
o'neil
--but
for
the
same
reason
we
don't
ask
whether
the
suspect
has
sufficient
knowledge
to
supplement
the
information
he
needs.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
it--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
first,
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
miranda
went
out
of
its
way
to
--
to
specifically
approve
an
fbi
warning
that
said,
quote--
mr.
david
o'neil
--it
said
this
pattern
of
warnings
is
consistent
with
the
decision
that
we
announced
today.
and
i
think--
mr.
david
o'neil
--it
couldn't
have
been
clearer.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
that
argument
was
made
by
justice
clark
in
dissent,
and
the
court
did
not
agree
with
that.
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
court
thought
that--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
no,
they
didn't.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
i
think
that's
exactly
the
point,
that
you
don't
assume
that
a
suspect
is
only
capable
of
understanding--
mr.
david
o'neil
--i
think
a
--
a
--
advice
of
the
right
to
counsel
or,
as
the
court
put
it
in
a
different
place
in
the
miranda
opinion,
the
right
to
obtain
the
services
of
an
attorney
of
his
choice,
that
would
be
constitutionally
adequate.
the
federal
government
does
not
use
those
warnings
because
they
create
a
list
--
a
risk
of
litigation.
we
think
that's
the
correct
reading
of
miranda,
but
that,
of
course,
is
not
guarantee
that
other
courts
would
read
it
that
way.
and,
indeed,
2
years
after
miranda,
the
fifth
circuit
had
gone
the
other
way
and
decided
that,
in
fact,
a
right
to
counsel
warning
is
not
sufficient.
but,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
how
these
warnings
convey
presence
is
that
a
suspect
is
not
going
to
draw
the
highly
counterintuitive
assumption
that
if
he
is
told
that
he
can
have
an
attorney
not
only
before
answering
any
questions
but
during
this
interview,
that
he
is
going
to
need
to
walk
in
and
out
of
the
room
each
time
he
wants
to
talk
to
an
attorney.
it
may--
mr.
david
o'neil
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
we
think
that--
mr.
david
o'neil
--we
think
that
--
that
--
that
was
the
warning
that
this
court
confronted
in
bridgers,
and
we
think
that
would
be
a
much
closer
and
more
difficult
case,
but
we
think
that,
yes,
we
--
we
agree
with
the
decision
cited
in
our
brief
that
a
suspect
would
not
assume
that
that
attorney
will
become
unavailable
the
minute
the
first
question
is
asked.
we
think
that--
mr.
david
o'neil
--thank
you.
