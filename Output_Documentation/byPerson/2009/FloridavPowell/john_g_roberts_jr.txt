jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
today
in
case
08-1175,
florida
v.
powell.
mr.
jacquot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
"any"
--
just
to
make
sure;
you've
said
two
different
things.
it
says
"any
of
our
questions",
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
o'neil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
is
that?
is
that
set
forth
in
the
--
in
the
briefs?
the
fbi
form?
where
--
where
is
that
set
forth?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
brueckheimer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
the
fbi
warning
that
was
specifically
approved
in
miranda
was
inconsistent
with
miranda?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
says
consistent
--
consistent
with
the
procedure
which
we
delineate
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe,
but
it
says
--
it
says
the
--
what
the
fbi
--
the
pattern
of
warning
--
well,
let
me
make
sure
i
get
it
exact.
"the
present
pattern
of
warnings
and
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
individual
followed
as
a
practice
by
the
fbi
is
consistent
with
the
procedure
we
delineate
today.
"
and
the
fbi
warning
says
nothing
about
presence
or
with
--
or
with
counsel
with
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
okay.
i'll
take
"consistent
with".
that
means
that
it
complies
with
the
rule
in
miranda.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
how
is
the
fbi
warning
consistent
with
the
procedure
the
court
delineated
in
miranda?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
said
how
is
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
would
say
that
it's
not
consistent
with
miranda.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
it
says
is
that
the
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
individual
followed
in
the
fbi
is
consistent
with.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
--
is
there
any
--
i'm
not
sure
this
is
pertinent
--
but
is
there
any
malevolent
reason
tampa
police
would
adopt
this
warning?
i
mean,
someone
says,
well,
here's
what
the
fbi
uses.
and
they
say,
well,
i
tell
you
what,
if
we
just
say
you
have
a
right
to
an
attorney
before
answering
any
questions
and
then
later
say
you
can
exercise
this
right
any
time,
maybe
we'll
be
able
to
trick
some
people
who
don't
think
they
can
actually
have
the
lawyer
there.
in
other
words
was
this
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
--
and
you
can't
think
of
any
bad
reason
they
might
have
done
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
think
it's
a
good
thing,
though,
that
they
changed
their
forms
to
track
the
fbi
form
after
--
after
this
litigation
started.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-1175,
florida
versus
powell.
