isn't
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--isn't
the
crux
of
your
argument
that
for
present
purposes
the
term
"conviction"
must
include
a
determination
of
recidivism?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
would
you
say--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
do
you
say
about
21
u.s.c.
section
851,
the
federal
recidivism
provision,
which
says:
"no
person
who
stands
convicted
of
an
offense
under
this
part
shall
be
sentenced
to
increased
punishment
by
reason
of
one
or
more
prior
convictions.
"
so
under
that
statute,
the
conviction
does
not
include
the
recidivism
determination.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this
question--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
--
suppose
a
state
makes
simple
possession
a
felony.
now,
that
doesn't
make
it
a
felony
for
these
purposes,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
but
in
sentencing
the
--
the
defendant
in
state
court
for
this
felony,
the
--
the
defendant
concedes
that
he
had
a
prior
conviction,
and
the
judge
finds
that
and
takes
that
into
account
in
imposing
the
sentence.
what
would
happen
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what's
missing
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
--
and
a
situation
where,
just
because
of
the
vagary
of
state
law,
recidivism
is
something
that
has
to
be
proven
in
order
to
bring
the
offense
into
the
--
into
the
felony
level?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
seems
to
be
a
totally
formalistic
distinction
that's
based
on
the
vagaries
of
state
law.
what
--
what
is
the
difference
between
someone
who
is
found
by
a
court
under
a
state
recidivism
provision
to
have
--
to
be
eligible
for
an
increased
punishment
as
a
result
of
that
finding
and
someone
who
is
found
by
a
court
in
the
context
of
sentencing,
discretionary
sentencing,
to
have
a
felony
possession,
to
have
a
prior
--
a
prior
conviction
and
receives
an
increased
sentence
as
a
result
of
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
--
is
there
any
functional
difference
between
those
two
situations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
does
it
matter
in
that
situation
that
that's
an
element,
that
has
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
a
--
could
a
defendant
whose
prior
conviction
was
under
a
state
recidivism
statute
claim
that
that
conviction
was
invalid
because
that
defendant
was
at
that
time
deprived
of
the
right
of
counsel?
do
you
see
a
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
in
which
--
and
the
situation
in
the
sort
of
case
we
have
here
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
prior
conviction
was
invalid
because
of
the
deprivation
of
the
right
of
counsel?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
are
they
distinguishable?
you
could
--
you
can
--
you
could
--
a
person
faced
with
removal
could
challenge
a
prior
conviction
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
deprivation
of
the
right
of
counsel,
whether
or
not
it
was
pursuant
to
a
recidivism
--
whether
or
not
there
was
a
recidivism
issue
in
it,
couldn't
--
couldn't
they?
