justice
john
paul
stevens
the
petitioner
is
a
lawful
permanent
resident
who's
lived
in
the
united
states
since
he
was
five
years
old.
he
faces
deportation
under
federal
law
because
he
committed
two
misdemeanor
drug
offenses
in
texas.
for
first
offense
possession
of
less
than
2
ounces
of
marijuana,
he
received
a
sentence
of
20
days
in
jail.
for
the
second
offense,
possession
without
a
prescription
of
one
tablet
of
a
common
anti-anxiety
medication,
he
received
a
sentence
of
10
days
in
jail.
after
the
second
offense
the
federal
government
initiated
removal
proceedings
against
him,
he
conceded
that
he
was
removable.
the
claims
that
he
was
eligible
for
discretionary
relief
from
removal
under
section
1229b(a)
of
the
immigration
statute.
so
to
decide
whether
he's
eligible
for
cancellation
or
removal,
we
have
to
decide
whether
he
is
guilty,
whether
he
has
been
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony.
for
reasons
stated
in
my
opinion
for
the
court
and
in
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment
of
by
a
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas,
we
unanimously
hold
that
he
has
not
been
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony.
