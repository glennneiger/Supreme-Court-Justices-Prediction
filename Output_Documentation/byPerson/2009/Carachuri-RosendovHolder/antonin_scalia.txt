i
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
that
his
reentry
was
not
illegal
because
his
removal
was
illegal?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
state
felony?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
felony
has
to
be
a
federal
felony,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
punishable
as
a
felony
under
the
federal
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
was
punishable
as
a
felony
because
it
was
his
second
drug
offense.
he
was
a
recidivist.
and
although
it
was
only
a
misdemeanor
under
state
law,
under
the
controlled
substances
act
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
a
felony,
for
a
federal
felony.
i
--
i
--
i
don't
know
why
that
doesn't
fit
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't
be
convicted
of
a
federal
felony
in
a
state
court.
he
has
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
may
be
a
misdemeanor,
which
would
subject
him
to
a
felony
conviction
in
federal
court
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
and
i
think
that's
--
that's
what
this
is.
he's
convicted
of
a
drug
offense,
and
if
--
if
he
were
prosecuted
in
federal
court,
he
would
--
he
was
punishable
as
a
felon--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
federal
court
under
the
--
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
we're
not
talking
about
immigration
consequences.
let's
--
let's
assume
we're
talking
about
an
american
citizen
who
has
committed
a
--
a
misdemeanor
drug
offense.
when
he
is
brought
up
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
even
though
he
wasn't
found
to
have
been
a
recidivist
by
the
state
conviction,
couldn't
he
be
prosecuted
under
the
controlled
substances
act
for
a
felony
because
in
fact
he
is
a
recidivist?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
--
the
crucial
word
here
is
"punishable"
as
a
felony
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
and
the
fact
is
if
indeed
he's
a
recidivist,
he
could
be
punished
for
the
--
for
the
felony.
now,
you're
quite
correct
that
the
federal
court
would
have
to
find
the
recidivism,
but
--
but
still
he
would
be
punishable
as
a
recidivist.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we've
held
that's
okay--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you
don't
need
a
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
do
you
distinguish
nijhawan?
i
mean,
there
what
made
it
a
federal
felony
was
the
fact
that
more
than
$10,000
was
obtained
from
the
victims.
but
that
was
not
found
in
the
--
in
the
state
conviction.
it
simply
was
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
the
$10,000?
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
was
never
convicted
of
having
obtained
by
fraud
more
than
$10,000
from
the
victim.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
still
had
the
word
"convicted".
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
you're
relying
on.
that
word
was
applicable
there
as
much
as
it's
applicable
here,
and
we
did
not
require
him
to
have
been
convicted
of
having
obtained
more
than
$10,000.
