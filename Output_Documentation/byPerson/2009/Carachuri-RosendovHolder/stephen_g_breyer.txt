justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
you
go
further
than
you
need
to
and,
moreover,
imagine
a
state
offense
that
just
says
possession
of
marijuana,
zero
to
5
years.
now,
our
problem
is,
reading
those
words,
is
that
or
is
that
not
analogous
to
a
federal
--
a
federal
--
what
a
federal
law
would
make
a
felony?
and
suppose
you
discovered
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
all
the
people
who
did
have
a
prior
conviction
got
more
than
a
year.
in
simple
possession,
they
got
less
than
a
year,
which
you'd
have
to
do
research
to
find
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
those
were
the
facts,
i
would
say
it
is
analogous
to
the
federal
felony
where
this
person
was
sentenced
to
more
than
a
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
could
argue
that
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
don't
see
where--
that
there's
a
line,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
rule
is
set
forth
--
we
said
in
the
last
sentence
here
of
--
what's
the
case?
you
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
lopez.
it
says:
"a
state
offense
constitutes
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act
only
if
it
proscribes
conduct.
"
so
we're
not
looking
at
what
happened
in
reality.
we're
reading
some
words
from
a
state
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
proscribes
conduct
punishable
as
a
felony
under
that
federal
law.
this
would
be
normal.
we
get
some
words
in
the
state
statute,
and
you
have
to
decide
are
the
--
those
words
cover
some
events
in
the
world.
and
you
look
at
those
words,
what
--
the
events
they
cover
and
discover,
did
they
or
are
they
analogous
or
not
analogous
to
what
is
a
felony
under
federal
law?
sometimes
that's
easy,
sometimes
it's
not.
you
have
a
case,
i
think,
that's
easy.
but
i
can
imagine
the
case
you're
talking
about,
not
easy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
say,
what
do
you
do?
i
see
no
rule
there.
i
see
no
rule
absolute
how
you
treat
it,
so
i
probably
would
treat
it
by
trying
to
look
at
what
really
happens
under
this
statute
in
the
world.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
where
does
it
say
"offense
element"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
where
in
the
statute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
it
say
"offense
elements"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
say
that
it
says
"elements".
i
don't
see
any
of
our
cases
that
say
"elements".
and
i
--
and
i
think
that
--
that
what
we
could
do
is
look
to
the
conduct
that's
likely
to
be
at
issue
under
these
state
words,
and
if
in
fact
it's
regular
that
the
state
does
punish
people
for
more
than
a
year
when
in
fact
they
do
possess
for
the
third
time,
at
least
there
would
be
a
good
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
that
counts.
you
want
to
argue
it
doesn't
count,
okay.
i
don't
know
why
you
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
i
mean,
i'm
interested
in
why
you
do,
since
that
isn't
your
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
the
reason
i
ask
my
question
is
it
seems
to
me
your
approach,
which
i
think
is
consistent
with
lopez
and
nijhawan
absolutely--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
raise
the
question
you
are
talking
about.
so
i
want
to
know:
why
are
you
talking
about
it?
because
i
might
be
missing
something,
because
i
don't
think
--
if
i'm
right,
your
case
doesn't
raise
these
issues.
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well,
skip
the
question.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
exact
words
of
lopez,
which
i
think
are
important:
"we
hold
that
a
state
offense
constitutes
a
felony
punishable
under
controlled
substance.
"
"only
if
it
proscribes
conduct
punishable
as
a
felony.
"
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
federal
law.
now,
there's
an
ambiguity
when
you
use
a
word
like
"offense"
or
"crime".
sometimes
you
mean
what
this
guy
did,
and
sometimes
you're
referring
to
a
statute.
it's
statutes
that
proscribe,
not
what
this
guy
did.
so
we're
talking
about
the
statute.
so
what
it
tells
us
to
do
--
and
we
said
the
same
thing
in
nijhawan,
and
i
have
written
in
other
opinions
the
same
thing
--
you
go
read
the
state
statute.
forget
what
he's
done.
read
the
statute
and
see
if
the
statute
proscribes
conduct
that
would
amount
to
a
felony
under
federal
law.
so
let
us
read
the
statute.
we
turn
to
the
statute
of
conviction.
what
it
says
is
it
is
a
class
a
misdemeanor
for
which
you
are
punishable
of
less
than
a
year
if
you
possess
less
than
28
grams
or
whatever.
it
says
nothing
about
recidivism.
there
is
no
increased
punishment
for
recidivism.
so
all
we
did
was
read
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
proscribe
conduct
that
would
be
a
felony
under
federal
law;
it
proscribes
conduct
that
would
be
a
misdemeanor.
qed.
this
person
has
not
been
punished
in
texas
under
a
statute
that
proscribes
conduct
that
would
be
a
felony
under
federal
law.
end
of
case.
now,
what
is
the
matter
with
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean,
"a
two-step
inquiry"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
does
it
say
that?
where
does
it
say
that
in
the
language?
you
are
looking
to
the
conduct
that
the
statute
proscribes,
not
what
he
engaged
in.
suppose
the
state
statute
says
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
steal
a
chicken,
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
a
misdemeanor.
he
is
convicted
of
stealing
a
chicken.
it
turns
out
that
the
way
he
stole
the
chicken
was
to
burn
down
the
farmhouse.
[laughter]
that
is
a
felony.
now,
what
we
have
written
is:
forget
the
second.
i've
written
it
in
five
opinions
or
four
or
three,
most
of
which
had
a
majority.
it
is
called
--
it
is
written
right
here
in
this
case.
it
is
written
in
nijhawan.
what
is
it
that
tells
us
to
go
beyond
the
conduct
that
the
state
statute
proscribes,
not
some
other
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
the
additional
question?
read
me
the
words
of
the
statute
that
--
there
might
be.
i'm
not
--
i'm
being
argumentative,
but
i
want
to
know
what
words
in
the
statute
say
there
--
or
what
words
in
a
case
say
go
look
to
some
other
thing
beyond
what
the
state
statute
proscribes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
what
offense?
the
offense
proscribed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--by
state
law.
that's
why
i
asked
you:
where
does
the
state
statute
proscribe
something
that
has
to
do
with
recidivism?
i've
read
that
state
statute
three
or
four
times.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
related
question,
which
will
show
what
i'm
trying
--
another
thing
that's
worrying
me.
suppose
we're
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
now,
i
have
--
this
is
my
hypothetical.
you've
heard
of
cat
burglars.
well,
this
gentleman
is
called
the
pussycat
burglar,
and
the
reason
is
he's
never
harmed
a
soul.
he
only
carries
soft
pillows
as
weapons.
if
he
sees
a
child,
he
gives
them
ice
cream.
[laughter]
it
is
absolutely
established
that
this
person
in
breaking
into
that
house
at
night
only
wanted
to
steal
a
pop
gun,
and
he
is
the
least
likely
to
cause
harm
in
the
world.
question:
he
is
convicted
of
burglary.
is
that
a
crime
of
violence?
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
of
course,
because
we
are
not
looking
to
whether
he
is
the
pussycat
burglar
or
the
cat
burglar.
we
are
to
look
to
the
statute
of
conviction
and
see
what
it
is
that
that
behavior
forbids
--
the
statute
forbids.
lewis,
nijhawan
say
--
do
precisely
the
same
thing
with
this
part
of
that
long
list.
indeed,
nijhawan
lists
this
provision
as
an
example
of
what
you
would
do
the
same
thing
for.
now
i'm
back
to
my
first
question.
let's
do
it.
read
the
texas
statute.
and
where
in
that
texas
statute
does
it
say
a
word
about
recidivism
or
punish
that
conduct?
now,
if
i
adopt
your
position,
am
i
not,
not
simply
overturning
lewis
and
nijhawan,
but
getting
a
very
mixed
up
area
of
the
law
which
we
have
tried
to
straighten
out
--
taylor,
acca
--
once
again
totally
mixed
up.
that's
my
concern.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
was
worrying
me,
that's
why
i
asked
the
other
question.
but
the
--
what
was
worrying
me
would
be
a
statute
where
they
--
it's
big
enough
in
the
state
to
cover
possession
with
recidivism
or
not,
and
they
deal
with
it
at
the
punishment
stage,
and
i
can
see
your
point
in
respect
to
that.
but
that
isn't
this
statute.
this
statute
not
only
doesn't
deal
with
it
at
the
punishment
stage;
it's
forbidden
to
take
it
into
account
because
what
this
says
is
you
can
only
get
recidivism
if
you
previously
had
a
conviction
for
a
class
a
misdemeanor,
and
the
prior
conviction
here
was
a
class
b;
and,
therefore,
one
thing
we
know
about
the
statute
is
that
under
this
statute,
his
behavior
as
a
recidivist
is
as
close
to
irrelevant
as
you
could
make
it.
that's
why
i'm
back
to
the
cat
burglar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
did?
well,
nijhawan
uses
this
provision
as
an
example
of
where
it
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
--
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
she
got
to
that
argument
at
the
end,
and
she
said
my
--
i
wrote
that,
i
think,
and
i
--
when
i
used
as
an
example
or
the
text
uses
an
example,
this
provision
is
one
where
you
don't
look
to
real
conduct.
she
said
that
was
a
mistake,
really.
it
was
overstated,
because
what
they're
saying
is
that
recidivism
analogous
to
the
$10,000
was
meant
to
be
a
real
conduct
aspect,
not
just
offense
of
conviction,
and
--
and
she
gave
similar
reasons.
that's
why
--
similar
reasons
are
that
the
states
are
too
mixed
up
in
this;
it
will
be
too
difficult
to
look
at
that
element
itself.
so
she's
trying
to
analogize
that
to
the
$10,000.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
good
analogy?
