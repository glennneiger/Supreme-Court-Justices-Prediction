mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
long-time
lawful
permanent
resident
aliens
with
two
convictions
for
minor
drug
possession
offenses
are
subject
to
removal
from
the
united
states,
but
they
are
not
categorically
ineligible
to
seek
discretionary
relief
from
removal
from
the
attorney
general
based
on
their
connections
and
deep
family
ties
to
the
country.
categorical
ineligibility
for
discretionary
relief
arises
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
when
a
permanent
resident
has
been,
quote,
"convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony",
close
quote,
with
the
relevant
category
here
permanent
residents
who
have
been,
quote,
"convicted
of
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
close
quote.
individuals,
such
as
petitioner,
who
have
been
convicted
of
drug
possession,
but
as
to
whom
there
has
been
no
finding
of
recidivism,
have
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act
rather
than
a
felony.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
not
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
in
our
view.
and
the
government,
it's
notable,
doesn't
make
a
mootness
argument.
and
i
think
the
reason
they
don't
is
that
the
--
in
lopez,
this
court
understood
that
the
initial
removal
doesn't
annul
the
ability
of
an
individual
to
get
cancellation.
and
so,
as
your
honor
correctly
observes,
the
question
would
be
whether
the
reentry
has
an
effect
on
the
cancellation
and
the
eligibility
for
cancellation.
and
it
does
not
because
petitioner
was
removed
again
by
reinstatement
of
the
original
removal
order.
and
so,
if
there's
an
argument
that
the
initial
removal
order
wasn't
good
because
cancellation
should
have
been
granted,
that
also
carries
through
to
the
reinstatement.
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
procedural
context,
there
is
no
mootness
argument
and
i
think
that's
why
the
government
doesn't
make
--
doesn't
take
that
position.
so
the
question
before
the
court--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
it's
not
that
his
reentry
wasn't
illegal.
it's
that
when
he
was
then
again
removed,
that
the
--
the
way
that
that
was
accomplished
was
by
reinstatement
of
the
original
removal
order.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
so,
if
the
original
removal
order
would
have
been
extinguished
by
a
grant
of
the
cancellation
order,
then
that
carries
forward
to
the
reinstatement
of
the
original
removal
--
removal
order
as
well.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
nothing
additional
happens
because
of
the
reentry.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
doesn't
make
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
does,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
i
think
--
i
think
the
way
that
gets
taken
into
account
is
it
would
be
one
of
the
discretionary
considerations
that
the
attorney
general
could
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
grant
discretionary
relief
in
the
same
way
that
the
original
conviction
for
drug
possession
could
be
taken
into
account.
our
position--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
removal
order
would
stand,
but
if
cancellation
were
granted,
then
he
couldn't
be
removed
pursuant
to
that
removal
order,
because
the
--
the
effect
of
granting
cancellation
would
be
that
he's
no
longer
removable.
he
gets
favorable
discretionary
relief
that
enables
him
to
stay
in
the
country.
and
i
think
the
predicate
of
your
honor's
question
is
correct,
that
we
don't
contest
removability.
he
was
removable
because
of
his
drug
possession
--
drug
possession
conviction.
the
question
is
whether
he
retains
eligibility
to
seek
a
favorable
exercise
of
relief
from
the
attorney
general
based
on
affirmative
equities
in
his
--
in
his
favor,
such
as
his
deep
family
ties
to
the
country,
the
presence
of
united
states
citizen
children
here,
his
lack
of
connections
to
the
country
to
which
he
would
be
removed,
his
employment
history,
and
considerations
of
that
variety.
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
he
and
other
individuals
who
are
similarly
situated
should
have
an
opportunity
to
make
that
case
to
the
attorney
general.
he
is
removable.
the
question
is
whether
the
attorney
general
is
in
a
--
is
in
a
position
to
grant
him
a
favorable
exercise
of
discretion.
and
we
think
the
attorney
general
is,
because
in
order
to
be
categorically
ineligible
for
discretionary
relief
from
removal,
a
permanent
resident
alien
has
to
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
and
when
you've
been
convicted
of
drug
possession
and
there
has
been
no
finding
of
recidivism,
you
have
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
what
elements?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
sotomayor,
at
the
very
least
what
would
have
had
to
have
happened
is
that
he
would
have
had
to
have
been
found
to
be
a
recidivist
under
a
state
provision
that
attaches
sentencing
consequences
to
being
found
to
have
been
a
recidivist.
and
so,
what
you
need
is
an
analogous
state
offense
to
the
federal
offense
of
recidivist
possession.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
analogous
enough
to
count,
in
the
sense
that
what
you
need
under
the
federal
law
is
a
finding
of
recidivism
at
least.
that's
our
principal
submission.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it's
a
determination
by
the
court
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--by
the
state
convicting
court.
in
the
case
of
a
state
conviction,
it
would
be
a
determination
by
the
state
convicting
court
that
the
person
in
fact
has
a
prior
conviction.
and
then
as
a
consequence
under
the
state
scheme,
a
sentencing
consequence
would
attach.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes,
in
--
in
the
context
of
a
state
conviction.
it--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
state
felony,
no.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
correct.
and
that's
the
work
done
by
the
words
"punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
but
--
but,
justice
scalia,
he
has
to
have
been
convicted
of
the
felony.
that's
the
critical
distinction.
he
may
have
committed
a
felony--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--he
has
to
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--he
was--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--he
was
not
punishable
as
a
felon
in
federal
court
for
two
reasons:
first,
he
was
convicted
of
drug
possession.
a
person
in
federal
court
who
is
convicted
of
drug
possession
is
a
misdemeanant,
not
a
felon,
unless
and
until
there's
a
finding
that
he's
a
recidivist.
you
have
to
have
the
finding
of
recidivist
in
order
for
a
felony
sentence
even
to
conceivably
attach
to
an
individual,
and
you
just
don't
have
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
all
you
have
is
a
conviction
of
drug
possession
alone.
a
felony
sentence
doesn't
even
come
into
the
picture
unless
there's
a
finding
of
recidivism.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that
didn't
happen
in
the
state
court.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
for
present
purposes,
that's
correct.
and
justice
alito,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
--
and
this
goes
to
the
second
response
to
your
question,
justice
scalia
--
that
the
statute,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
defines
"conviction"
in
a
particular
way.
it
defines
"conviction"
as
"a
formal
judgment
of
guilt.
"
"entered
by
a
court.
"
as
your
honor's
opinion
for
the
court
in
deal
v.
united
states
understood,
statutes
could
define
convictions
in
one
of
two
ways:
it
could
define
a
conviction
as
a
finding
of
guilty,
or
it
could
define
a
conviction
as
the
formal
judgment
based
on
that
finding.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
here
we
have
the
latter.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
under--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--under
that
statute
--
different
statutes
conceive
of
it
different
ways,
but
the
applicable
definition
of
"conviction"
here,
because
we're
talking
about
an
immigration
consequence,
is
the
definition
of
"conviction"
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
and
that
definition
is
set
forth
at
page
2a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
blue
brief,
the
opening
brief.
and
it's
8
u.s.c.
1101(a)(48)(a),
and
it
says
that:
"the
term
"conviction"
means,
with
respect
to
an
alien,
a
formal
judgment
of
guilt
of
the
alien
entered
by
a
court.
"
and
so,
here
you
have
"a
formal
judgment
of
guilt"
as
the
operative
definition
of
a
conviction,
and
that
formal
judgment
of
guilt
includes
both
the
adjudication
of
guilt
and
the
sentence.
and
so
the
important
point
to
bear
in
mind
is
that
at
the
time
that
the
conviction,
as
defined
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
is
entered,
we
know
whether
the
person
has
been
found
to
have
been
a
recidivist.
at
that
point,
the
adjudication
of
guilt
has
happened,
the
sentence
has
been
imposed,
and
we
know
whether
a
finding
of
recidivism
has
been
made.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
finding,
the
maximum
sentence
they
could
attach
under
federal
law,
justice
scalia,
is
a
misdemeanor
sentence
of
1
year
of
imprisonment.
a
felony
sentence
is
not
on
the
table,
and
if
the
maximum
sentence
to
which
a
person
is
subject
is
a
misdemeanor
sentence,
the
person
has
been
--
has
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor;
they
haven't
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
and
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--oh,
sure.
but
--
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
confuses
two
things.
in
that
situation,
the
second
proceeding
is
in
federal
court--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--and
in
that
federal
court
proceeding,
you
can
take
account
of
the
prior
state
court
conviction,
but
in
that
second
proceeding,
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
previously
in
state
court
would
have
to
have
been
found
by
the
federal
court.
that's
the
relevant
finding
of
recidivism,
and
in
the
absence
of
that
finding
of
recidivism,
the
federal
defendant
wouldn't
be
subject
to
a
felony
sentence.
he
would
only
be
subject
to
a
misdemeanor
sentence.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
he
has
to
be
convicted
of
a
felony,
justice
scalia,
and
in
the
absence
of
a
finding
of
recidivism,
he
can't
have
been
convicted
of
the
felony.
he
may
be
punishable
as
a
felon
in
the
abstract
ex
ante.
so
i
don't
take
issue
with
the
proposition
that
a
person
commits
recidivist
possession
when
they
commit
possession
and
they
have
a
prior
conviction.
in
that
abstract
sense,
the
person
has
committed
recidivist
possession,
and
if
they
were
charged
and
found
to
have
been
a
recidivist,
they
would
be
convicted
of
recidivist
possession.
but
in
the
absence
of
that
finding,
they
haven't
been
convicted
of
recidivist
possession,
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
doesn't
have
to
be
by
a
jury,
and
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
state,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
by
a
jury,
because
i
think
several
states
have
the
recidivism
component
of
the
offense
as
a
finding
that
could
be
made
by
the
court,
but
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--and
you've
held--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
okay
as
a
constitutional
matter.
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
are--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
is
in
those
five
states,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
don't
think
that
should
give
the
court
a
great
deal
of
pause,
for
the
following
two
reasons.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
what
would
happen
is
this:
the
person
would
not
be
categorically
ineligible
for
discretionary
relief.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
they
wouldn't
have
been
convicted
of
recidivist
possession.
but
it's
important
to
note,
justice
kennedy,
that
doesn't
mean
that
those
prior
convictions
don't
enter
into
the
picture
at
all.
they
do,
because,
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
attorney
general,
the
attorney
general
can
take
into
account
any
prior
convictions,
including
those
that
don't
render
somebody
categorically
ineligible.
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
the
person
has
a
chance
to
make
a
discretionary
case.
they
do
have
that
chance
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
but
those
convictions
would
be
taken
into
account.
now,
i
want
to
point
out,
though,
that
there's
another
reason
that
i
think
the
fact
that
in
that
hypothetical
it
wouldn't
render
the
defendant
categorically
ineligible
for
discretionary
relief
shouldn't
give
the
court
a
great
deal
of
pause.
and
that's
because
the
relevant
category
of
aggravated
felony
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
illicit
trafficking
in
a
controlled
substance.
that's
the
category
that's
outlined
by
the
statute.
now,
with
respect
to
that
category,
every
state
has
trafficking
laws.
every
state
punishes
drug
trafficking.
so
every
state's
offenses
do
count
for
purposes
of
this
category
of
aggravated
felony.
when
we're
--
that's
the
iceberg.
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
is
recidivist
possession,
which
is
a
subset
of
illicit
trafficking
in
a
controlled
substance.
now,
with
respect
to
that
tip,
federal
convictions
for
recidivist
possession
still
do
count,
so
we
have
those.
with
respect
to
the
state--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
sure,
but
if
a
state
--
two
responses,
mr.
chief
justice:
if
a
state
prosecutor
does
prosecute
under
an
available
recidivist
possession
offense,
then
that
would
count
because
the
state
prosecutor
would
have
brought
the
charge,
the
finding
by
hypothesis
would
have
been
made.
that
would
be
felony
recidivist
possession
under
federal
law,
and
there
would
be
categorical
ineligibility.
now,
i
think
what
may
be
--
what
may
be
sort
of
lurking
beneath
your
honor's
question
is
the
recognition
that
the
federal
consequences
of
a
state
conviction
are
going
to
turn
on
state
prosecutorial
decisions.
that's
true.
but
that's
a
fixed
feature
of
any
scheme
in
which
federal
immigration
consequences
turns
on
what
happens
in
state
court,
and
this
court's
decision
in
lopez
recognizes
that.
for
example,
states
--
several
states
don't
have
a
federal
offense
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
drugs.
that's
a
federal
offense.
what
states,
some
states,
have
instead
is
possession
with
a
degree
of
penalty
attached
to
the
amount
of
drugs
possessed.
they
don't
have
the
separate
offense
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
now,
the
fact
that
certain
states
don't
have
that
offense
doesn't
mean
that
an
individual
who
is
convicted
of
state
possession
with
no
finding
of
an
intent
to
distribute
would
be
categorically
ineligible
for
discretionary
relief
from
removal,
because
what
congress
understood
was
that
some
states
will
have
qualifying
offenses
and
some
states
won't.
in
those
states
that
do,
where
the
state
has
the
offense
and
where
the
state
prosecutor
makes
the
decision
to
charge
under
that
offense
will
--
at
that
point
the
state
conviction
will
count
as
a
federal
felony.
it
will
be
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
and
the
person
at
that
point
would
be
categorically
ineligible
for
discretionary
relief.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
it
would
be,
justice
breyer,
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
lopez?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
is
it
lopez?
is
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well
--
well,
with
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
that's
the
inquiry
that's
called
for
even
by
this
sentence.
i
think
what
this
sentence
called
for
is
an
inquiry
into
what
the
state
offense
captures
in
its
offense
elements
to
make
up
a
conviction.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because
i
think
that's
the
--
the
necessary
inquiry
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it's
--
it's
necessarily
what's
at
issue.
it--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--this
sentence
doesn't
necessarily
--
it
asks
whether--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
asks
whether
it
proscribes
conduct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
asks
whether
--
the
sentence
asks
whether
the
state
offense
proscribes
conduct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
i
read
"proscribes
conduct"
to
mean
there
would
be
offense
elements
of
proscribed
conduct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
breyer--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes,
i
don't
want
to
take
issue
--
i
don't
want
to
argue
against
myself,
certainly,
but
i
would
just
make
the
following
point:
that
if
i'm
understanding
what
your
honor
is
saying
correctly,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
am,
but
if
i'm
understanding
what
you're
saying
correctly,
i
would
just
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
court
dealt
with
that
sort
of
situation
in
the
four
corners
of
lopez
itself
when
it
talked
about
--
talks
about
what
happens
with
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
some
states
don't
have
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
as
an
offense;
they
only
have
possession.
now,
i
--
as
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
suggesting,
you
could
look
at
all
the
--
the
ken
of
individuals
who
have
been
convicted
of
state
possession
and
you
could
ask
as
a
matter
of
fact,
do
they
in
fact
possess
with
intent
to
distribute?
and
then
you
could
reach
some
consequence
on
that
basis.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
okay.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
--
i
have
to
confess,
i'm
not
exactly
sure
what
your
honor
is
asking.
so--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
wouldn't
constitute
the
analogy
to
the
federal
offense
of
recidivist
possession,
justice
--
justice
alito,
because
that
could
also
happen
in
the
federal
system.
in
the
federal
system,
you
could
have
an
individual
who
is
convicted
of
possession,
and
then
the
fact
that
they
had
a
prior
conviction
could
have
some
role
in
the
--
for
example,
in
the
presentencing
report.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
you
don't
have--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--two
things
are
missing,
justice
alito:
first,
you
don't
have
a
formal
judgment
of
guilt
entered
by
the
court,
which
is
what
a
conviction
requires.
and
the
consequence
of
not
having
a
formal
judgment
of
guilt
is
that
the
statutory
maximum
penalty
isn't
raised.
and
i
think
what's
relevant
here
is
that
when
you
have
a
finding
of
--
a
formal
judgment
of
guilt
of
recidivism
in
the
federal
system,
which
happens
when
the
prosecutor
brings
a
charge
and
the
court
makes
the
finding
at
sentencing,
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
against
the
defendant
is
raised
from
a
misdemeanor
sentence
to
a
felony
sentence.
but
that
doesn't
happen
in
a
situation
in
which
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
is
taken
into
account,
for
example,
under
a
presentencing
report.
it
doesn't
raise
the
statutory
maximum,
and
there's
no
formal
judgment
entered
based
on
that
determination
by
the
court.
and
so
that's
the
distinction.
and
i
think
the
relevant
way
to
look
at
it
is
you
take
account
of
what
would
happen
in
the
federal
system
and
you
ask:
would
it
have
the
consequence
in
the
federal
system
of
rendering
somebody
guilty
of
the
felony
of
recidivist
possession
as
opposed
to
the
misdemeanor
of
simple
possession?
and
it
wouldn't
in
the
federal
system,
and
by
parity
of
reasoning
it
also
would
not
have
that
consequence
in
the
state
system.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
there
is,
justice
alito,
and
let
me
just
say
as
a
preliminary
matter
it's
not
based
on
the
vagaries
of
state
law,
because
it's
--
i'm
applying
the
same
analysis
to
state
convictions
as
i
do
to
--
to
federal
convictions.
but
one
way
to
look
at
it
is
to
ask,
suppose
that
a
state
or
even
federal
law
made
it
salient
for
sentencing
purposes
whether
somebody
intended
to
distribute
when
they
possessed.
they
were
convicted
of
drug
possession.
there
is
an
offense
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
but
they're
not
charged
with
that
offense;
they're
charged
with
drug
possession.
and
then
sentencing
somehow
makes
it
salient,
not
for
purposes
of
raising
the
statutory
maximum,
but
just
for
purposes
of
sentencing
within
the
range
whether
the
person
intended
to
distribute.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
say
that
the
individual
was
convicted
of
the
felony
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
because
the
--
the
judge
in
sentencing
took
into
account
an
intent
to
distribute
in
some
way
under
a
sentencing
scheme.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
has
to
be
a
sentencing
factor
that
raises
the
statutory
maximum.
and
the
reason
that
matters
is
that
under
this
statute,
the
person
has
to
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
and
the
only
way
they're
convicted
of
a
felony
is
the
offense
of
which
they
are
convicted
can
lead
to
a
felony
sentence.
and
the
sentencing
factor
in
this
case
of
recidivism
is
necessary
in
order
to
give
rise
to
a
federal
sentence.
in
the
absence
of
that
finding,
the
person
has
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor,
because
the
maximum
sentence
they
can
receive
is
a
misdemeanor
sentence
of
1
year
of
imprisonment.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right,
and
because
it's
essential
to
the
federal
statute,
it's
necessarily
a
part
of
our
argument.
i
don't
think
our
argument
would
be
any
different
if
the
federal
statute
read
differently,
but
you
can
only
be
punishable
as
a
felon
under
federal
law
if
you
had
a
prior
drug
conviction,
and
if
you
had
a
prior
drug
conviction
that
was
in
fact
found
to
exist.
and
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
make
in
rebuttal
--
there's
two
points
i'd
like
to
make.
the
first
addresses
a
question
you
raised
concerning
what
happens
in
a
situation
in
which
the
second
proceeding
is
a
federal
proceeding
rather
than
a
state
proceeding.
and
i
think
this
is
important
to
highlight
the
government's
response,
because
if
the
second
proceeding
is
a
federal
proceeding,
we
have
a
person
who
has
a
prior
conviction
for
drug
possession.
we
have
a
person
who
is
then
prosecuted
in
federal
court
for
a
second
time
for
drug
possession.
the
prosecutor
by
hypothesis
never
brings
the
initial
conviction
into
play.
the
court
therefore
never
finds
that
the
person
is
a
recidivist.
as
a
consequence,
that
person
cannot
as
a
matter
of
law
receive
a
felony
sentence.
they
can
only
be
sentenced
as
a
misdemeanant.
but
nonetheless,
the
government
would
say
that
they
have
been,
quote,
"convicted
of
a
felony,
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
close
quote--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--even
though
no
felony
sentence
could
be
imposed.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
were
--
there
were
two
things
that
made
it
a
federal
felony,
justice
scalia.
first
was
it
had
to
be
an
offense
that
involved
fraud.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
then
--
and
that
had
to
be
found
by
the
convicting
court.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
was
no
issue
about
that.
our--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--our
point
is
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
--
but
there's
a
very
important
textual
distinction,
justice
scalia,
because
under
the
provision
at
issue
in
nijhawan,
the
offense
had
to
involve
fraud,
and
then
there
was
a
separator
in
which
the
loss
exceeds
$10,000.
and
the
court
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
text
read
"in
which".
that
was
critical,
and
another
thing
that
was
critical
in
nijhawan
was
that
if
you
looked
at
federal
statutes
and
asked,
were
there
any
that
as
to
which
the
elements
would
require
a
loss
in
excess
of
$10,000,
there
were
none.
and
because
of
that
practical
consequence,
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
that
congress
would
have
intended,
that
the
$10,000
be
something
that
the
immigration
judge
could
have
found.
we
have
the
opposite
situation
here.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
you
had
--
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because,
again,
the
test
--
the
text
also
had
"in
which",
which
the
court
found
critical
--
that
text
is
lacking
here
--
and
because
the
statute
would
have
had
no
practical
consequence,
absent
the
court's
interpretation.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
not
true
here.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because
for
both
reasons
that
the
court
found
that
you
could
look
to
the
circumstances
in
nijhawan,
neither
of
those
two
reasons
applies
here.
you
don't
have
a
textual
separator.
you
don't
have
the
words
"in
which".
all
you
have
is
the
word
"convicted".
and
you
also
don't
have
the
consequence
that
the
--
the
provision
would
cease
to
have
any
practical
implications
under
our
reading.
it
would
absolutely
have
practical
implications
under
our
reading,
because
anytime
a
person
was
found
to
have
been
a
recidivist
and
their
sentence
was
raised,
their
maximum
sentence
was
raised
as
a
consequence,
they
will
have
been
deemed
to
have
been
aggravated
felon.
but
here,
that
didn't
happen.
you'd
have
to
understand
that
in
the
federal
system,
even
though
an
individual
could
not
as
a
matter
of
law
be
sentenced
as
a
felon,
they
nonetheless
would
have
been
deemed
to
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
and
at
the
very
least
--
and
this
is
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make,
if
i
could
just--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
principles
of
lenity
which
the
government
agrees
are
potentially
applicable
here
would
dictate
ruling
in
our
favor
even
if
you
thought
that
the
text
was
ambiguous.
the
principles
of
lenity
do
apply.
an
individual
who
pleads
guilty
to
possession
in
exchange
for
a
prosecutor's
decision
to
refrain
from
charging
him
as
a
recidivist
and,
therefore,
could
only
be
sentenced
as
a
misdemeanor
i
think
should
be
allowed
to
be
convinced
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
rather
than
a
felony.
