mr.
srinivasan,
as
a
threshold
question,
is
there
a
mootness
problem
here,
because,
as
i
understand
it,
the
petitioner
came
back
to
the
country
illegally
and
committed
another
minor
crime?
but
his
coming
back
illegally
and
being
turned
away
again,
as
i
understand
the
law,
means
that
he
cannot
get
any
dispensation
as
a
result
of
the
illegal
entry.
so
even
if
we
were
to
hold
in
your
favor
now,
i
take
it
that
he
could
not
--
he
would
not
have
any
hope
of
getting
any
cancellation
of
removal
or
any
other
dispensation.
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
--
i
--
i
think
also
in
the
picture
is
that
he
never
contested
removability.
the
only
thing
was
the
grace:
would
--
would
he
qualify
for
discretionary
relief
by
the
attorney
general?
so
the
--
the
removal
order
itself,
i
take
it,
would
stand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
saharsky,
do
we
take
into
account
at
all
--
i
mean,
in
lopez
as
i
understand
it,
the
petitioner
prevailed
because
it
would
not
have
been
a
felony
under
the
federal
law.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
we're
talking
about
two
crimes.
one
is
a
small
amount
of
marijuana.
he
gets
20
days
in
jail.
the
other
is
a
pill
that
i
never
heard
of,
a
xan-something,
and
then
he
gets,
what,
10
days
in
jail
for
that.
if
you
could
just
present
this
scenario
to
an
intelligent
person
who
didn't
go
to
law
school,
as
you're
going
to
not
only
remove
him
from
this
country,
but
say
never,
ever
darken
our
doors
again
because
of
one
marijuana
cigarette
and
one
xan-something
pill
--
it
--
it
just
seems
to
me
that
if
there's
a
way
of
reading
the
statute
that
would
not
lead
to
that
absurd
result,
you
would
want
to
read
the
statute.
if
you
are
forced
to
read
it
because
there's
no
other
way
--
but
maybe
there
is
another
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
if
it's
in
the
federal
court,
and
the
--
they
are
going
to
use
it
as
a
recidivist
offense,
(a)
the
defendant
is
notified
of
that,
and
(b)
is
given
an
opportunity
to
say
there's
something
infirm
about
that
first
conviction.
that's
totally
absent
from
this
picture.
you
say,
oh,
well,
that's
just
a
matter
of
procedure,
so
he
doesn't
have
to
get
that
anyplace.
i
think
that
congress
is
requiring
that.
it's
certainly
an
element
of
fundamental
due
process
fairness,
notice
and
opportunity
to
say,
no,
the
first
conviction
shouldn't
count.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
point
is
that
if
it
all
happened
in
the
federal
court,
if
these
two
possession
offenses
all
happened
in
the
federal
court,
at
the
time
of
the
second
one
the
--
the
defendant
would
have
gotten
the
notice
and
the
opportunity
to
knock
it
out.
i'm
not
talking
about
immigration,
but
just
--
and
he
doesn't
have
that
opportunity
the
way
you
treat
it.
he
doesn't
--
didn't
get
that
in
the
state
court
because
nobody
thought
that
this
was
a
recidivist
offense
in
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
practically,
both
on
the
state
side
and
on
the
federal
side,
do
prosecutors
presented
with
a
simple
possession
case,
do
they
--
do
we
ever
see
in
real
life
this
combination
that
somebody's
going
to
be
convicted
as
a
recidivist
when
it's
one
marijuana
cigarette
on
one
time
and
one
pill
on
another?
do
prosecutors,
federal
or
state,
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
your
time
is
running
out.
i
take
it
your
answer
would
be
the
same
--
at
least
these
two
misdemeanors
were
committed
a
year
apart,
but
if
they
were
10
years
apart,
your
answer
would
still
be
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
another
crime,
i
thought
a
more
serious
crime,
though
still
a
misdemeanor,
in
this
picture,
but
the
texas
prosecutor
didn't
make
anything
of
that.
remind
me
of
what
that
was,
but
i
thought
it
was
a
--
a
more
grave
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
we
respect
that
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
not
to
make
it
a
--
a
ground
for
a
recidivist
charge,
but
we
don't
respect
the
prosecutor
--
texas
prosecutor
saying
i'm
just
going
to
treat
this
like
it's
a
first-time
misdemeanor;
that's
it.
