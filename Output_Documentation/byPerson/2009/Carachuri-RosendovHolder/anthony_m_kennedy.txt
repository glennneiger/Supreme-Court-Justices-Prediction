but
--
but
does--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
does
it
make
the
--
the
second
unlawful
entry
now
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
--
i
thought
it's
a
separate
offense
to
enter,
to
reenter
improperly,
and
--
and
that
stays
no
matter,
isn't
that
correct,
regardless
of
the
correctness
of
the
prior
removal
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
have
five
states,
isn't
it,
that
have
no
recidivist
provisions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
thrust
of
your
argument
or
the
logical
consequence
of
your
argument,
if
you
have
one
of
those
states
with
no
recidivist
provisions
and
you
have
ten
separate
possession
convictions,
they're
still
not
a
recidivist
under
the
federal
rules?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
in
my
hypothetical,
what
would
happen
if
--
if
there
was
a
deportation
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
there
is
no
recidivist
finding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
would
happen
if
there
--
forget
the
state.
there
are
two
federal
offenses.
the
first
federal
offense
is
drug
possession;
the
second
federal
offense,
drug
possession,
but
the
prosecutor
is
not
quite
sure
that
he
has
a
strong
case
or
she
has
a
strong
case
for
recidivism
because
of
the
first
conviction.
so
the
--
on
the
second
go-around,
the
conviction
is
without
the
added
finding
of
recidivism.
what
does
the
ina
do
with
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
--
if
i
could
just
finish
on
this
one
--
this
one.
in
this
hypothetical
that
we're
discussing,
the
--
the
two
federal
offenses
but
no
finding
of
recidivism,
does
the
ina
have
the
authority
to
question
the
first
conviction
because
it
was
uncounseled
or
in
effect
collaterally
question
the
first
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
what
--
our
hypothetical
here
is
federal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
case
do
i
read
to
establish
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
almendarez-torres
was
a
different
offense;
was
it
not?
i
mean
this
is
--
this
is
a
drug
offender
who
--
it's
not
like
a
burglar
who
stops
burglary
to
take
up
a
new
trade.
this
is
--
this
is
a
drug
offender
who
continues
to
repeat
under
the
drug
offense
laws,
and
i
thought
the
position
was
that
this
shows
a
particular
propensity,
a
particular
immoral
attitude
that's
not
being
corrected.
and
so
that
the
recidivism
makes
him
a
worse
person.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
usually
think
of
recidivism
when
we
talk
about
statistics
as
being
repeated
for
any
crime.
this
is
a
recidivism
of
a
special
kind.
it's
repeating
the
same
--
the
same
thing.
is
that
essential
to
your
argument?
i
know
it's
essential
to
the
--
to
the
federal
statute.
