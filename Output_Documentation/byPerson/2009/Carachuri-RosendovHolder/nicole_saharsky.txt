ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress's
judgment
here
was
that
all
aliens
who
engage
in
the
same
serious
conduct
would
be
treated
the
same
for
immigration
purposes.
and
petitioner
doesn't
dispute
that
he
has
two
convictions
for
drug
possession,
and
he
also
doesn't
dispute
that
had
that
second
case
been
prosecuted
in
federal
court,
he
could
have
been
punished
as
a
felon.
what
he
is
saying
is:
i
don't
want
my
aggravated
felony
to
count
because
of
a
difference
in
state
law,
because
of
a
difference
in
the
state
prosecutor's
decision.
but
what
this
court
held
in
lopez
is
that
congress's
judgment
controls
about
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
because
this
is
a
two-step
inquiry
and
you
only
did
step
one.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
a
two-step
inquiry.
there
are
two
questions.
the
first
is:
does
the
state
offense
correspond
to
an
offense
under
the
csa?
does
it
correspond
to
a
federal
offense,
and
that's
based
on
the
elements,
and
the
court
said
that
that
was
based
on
the
elements
on
page
51
of
nijhawan--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--but
there's
a
second
question,
which
is:
if
it
corresponds
to
a
federal
offense,
how
would
that
federal
offense
be
punishable?
the
csa
language
determines
that
we
need
to
look
at
that
second
inquiry.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
if
in
addition
to
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
the
conduct
is
what
the
state
statute
proscribes,
but
there's
an
additional
question
of
how
it
is
punishable--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--okay.
this
is
on
the
gray
brief,
page
10a,
and
this
is
the
definition
that
is
incorporated
into
the
aggravated
felony
definition
in
the
ina,
and
it
says
that
it
encompasses,
quote,
"any
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
and
in
lopez
the
court
interpreted
that
language
to
mean
an
offense
that
is
punishable
as
a
felony
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
recidivism
isn't
part
of
the
offense.
it
is
a
sentencing
factor.
justice
scalia
mentioned
that.
that's
something
this
court
has
recognized
on
many
occasions,
that
recidivism
is
something
that
can
be
established
by
the
sentencing
court.
you
are
right:
the
offense
is
drug
possession.
he
was
convicted
of
drug
possession
in
state
court.
that's
what
he
would
have
been
convicted
of
in
federal
court.
but
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
of
drug
possession
doesn't
answer
the
separate
question
of
how
that
offense
is
punishable.
if
it
were
his
first
offense,
it
would
be
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor.
if
it
was
his
second
offense,
it
would
be
punishable
as
a
felony.
and
we
think
that
that
--
that
approach
is
dictated
by
two
different
opinions,
the
first
of
which
is
lopez,
which
says
we
look
for
a
correspondence
between
the
state
offense
and
the
federal
offense,
but
then
we
also
have
this
question
of
how
the
offense
is
punishable
in
federal
court,
and
this
punishability
question
is
extremely
relevant.
the
entire
basis
for
the
court's
--
the
entire
basis
for
the
court's
opinion
was
that
congress's
judgment
about
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
controls.
it
is
not
state
by
state
judgment.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
we
don't
think
that
there
is
another
way,
because
the
court
said
in
lopez
in
interpreting
the
statutory
language
that
the
state's
judgment
about
how
an
offense
is
punished
does
not
control.
what
controls
is
congress's
judgment,
and
congress
has
taken
a
hard
line
over
the
past
20
years
on
criminal
aliens,
particularly
recidivist
criminal
aliens--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--particularly--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that
would
count
as
an
aggravated
felony,
as
punishable
as
a
felony,
because
the
aggravated
felony
language
incorporates
the
word
"punishable",
how
it
could
be
treated
under
federal
law,
not
how
it
actually
was
punished.
and
that's
because
congress
made
a
--
a
judgment
in
the
immigration
code
that
what
it
wanted
to
do
was
to
take
all
individuals
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
same
conduct--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--repeated
drug
possession,
and
treat
them
the
same.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
because
it's
punishable
--
yes,
because
it's
punishable
as
a
felony
under
federal
law,
because
congress
made
a
judgment
that
those
two
drug
possession
offenses,
the
fact
of
recidivism
makes
it
serious
enough
that
it
could
be--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it
--
it's
well
established
that
those
kind
of
challenges
can't
be
brought
in
immigration
court.
what
needs
to
happen
is
they
need
to
be
brought
in
the
state
court
of
conviction
through
the
procedures
that
are--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
in
that
case
if
it
--
the
individual
would
need
to
seek
relief
in
federal
court
in
terms
of
getting
his
conviction--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--with
respect,
we
disagree
because
congress
made
different
judgments
in
the
immigration
context
and
in
the
criminal
context.
immigration
is
very
different
from
criminal
proceedings.
this
court
has
said
that
on
numerous
occasions
the
rights
in
terms
of
due
process
and
counsel
and
the
like
are
very
different.
and
in
immigration,
congress
made
a
categorical
judgment
that
individuals
who
have
been
convicted
of
conduct
should
all
be
treated
the
same
and
that
they
all
should
be
removed
from
the
united
states
and
should
be
--
not
be
able
to
get
discretionary
relief.
in
the
criminal
sentencing
context,
which
you
are
talking
about,
section
--
the
section
851
procedures,
congress
made
a
judgment
that
those
procedures
which
have
criminal
consequences
and
already
are
individualized,
that
there
would
be
this
notice
provision.
but
that
provision
congress
did
not
apply
anywhere
in
the
immigration
laws.
and
if
you
look--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
was
just
going
to
say,
if
you
look
all
through
the
aggravated
felony
provisions
--
they
are
in
our
brief;
there
are
21
of
them
--
for
none
of
those
provisions
was
congress
concerned
about
notice
or
the
like.
it
said
the
individual
has
engaged
in
this
conduct
that
we
think
is
serious.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
right.
and
that's
because
congress
made
the
decision
to
have
those
types
of
notice
procedures
in
criminal
proceedings,
but
they
are
not
applicable
by
their
terms
anywhere
in
the
immigration
laws.
and
just
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
the
hypotheticals
that
you
and
justice
kennedy
have
been
talking
about,
if
there
is
a
federal
prosecution
and
the
person
has
sought
to
challenge
the
validity
of
his
conviction
and
it
has
been
proven
to
be
invalid,
then
in
that
case,
yes,
there
would
be
a
question
whether
that
conviction
could
be
used
in
the
immigration
proceedings.
there
is
an
entire
body
of
law
that
when
a
conviction
has
been
vacated,
it
doesn't
count
as
a
conviction
under
the
immigration
proceedings.
so
the
answer
is
if
it
is
a
person
in
state
court
and
they
think
that
there's
a
problem
with
their
underlying
conviction,
they
need
to
go
to
state
court
or
use
whatever
procedures
are
available
for
challenging
that.
but,
again,
the
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
prior
convictions
are
presumed
valid.
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
assume--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
--
i
can't
speak
to
state
prosecutors.
i
know
there
are
circumstances
in
which
federal
prosecutors
do
it,
although,
quite
honestly,
most
of
the
federal
drug
prosecutions
regard
the
more
serious
drug
crimes.
the
persons
that
come
to
our
attention
usually
can
be
charged
with
at
least
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
or
drug
trafficking
or
something
like
that.
and
when
we
do
charge
them
with
possession,
it's
usually
because
they
pleaded
down
and
we've
agreed
not
to
give
them
an
enhanced
sentence.
but
the
judgment
here
is
the
one
that
congress
made
about
whether
two
drug
possessions
is
serious,
serious
enough
to
qualify
as
a
felony.
and
congress--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
burglary
definition
depends
on
the
court's
modified
categorical
approach,
you
just
look
to
see
what
he
had
been
convicted
of
and
not
the
individual--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--circumstances
of
the
case.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
with
respect,
i
think
that
our
position
is
entirely
consistent
and,
in
fact,
follows
from
lopez
and
nijhawan
and
is
consistent
with
the
court's
modified
categorical
approach.
so,
let
me
just
talk
about
lopez
and
nijhawan,
because
i
want
to
make
sure
there's
not
any
confusion
about
that.
lopez
said
that
we
have
a
question
here
about
whether
the
state
offense
--
and
a
state
offense
is
made
up
of
here
drug
possession;
recidivism
isn't
something
that
you're
convicted
of,
it's
a
sentencing
factor.
you
look
at
the
state
offense
and
you
see
does
it
correspond
to
a
federal
offense?
here
it
does.
there
is
state
drug
possession;
there
is
federal
drug
possession.
and
then
you
ask
another
question.
and
this
court
said
in
lopez
that
that's
an
important
question
because
we
care
about
what
congress
thought,
which
is
how
is
this
offense
punishable
under
federal
law.
this
is
a
two-part
inquiry
where
the
first
part,
the
offense
elements,
does
need
to
be
established
in
state
court,
and
the
second
part,
which
goes
to
how
it
is
punishable,
does
not
need
to
be
established
in
state
court.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
recognized
in
its
opinion
under
nijhawan--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--albeit
in
a
second--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--what
makes
an
offense
punishable
as
a
felony
under
the
federal
controlled
substances
act
is
contained
in
section
844,
which
defines
the
substantive
punishments
available.
it
says
that
drug
possession
is
punishable
as
a
felony
in
certain
circumstances.
and
this
court
in
lopez,
particularly
in
footnote
6,
recognized
that
repeat
drug
possession
qualifies
as
punishable
as
a
felony
and
under
the
csa
and--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
this
is
what
is
interesting.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i'm
sorry.
what's
interesting
is
the
court
cited
for
this
provision
section
844(a),
which
defines
the
substantive
penalties
available.
it
didn't
cite
--
no
one
thought
was
relevant
section
851,
which
defines
procedures
that
happen
after
a
conviction
to
impose
a
certain
punishment.
so,
what
we're
talking
about
are
these
procedures
that
are
necessary.
and
it's
not
a
finding
of
a
valid
conviction.
it's
--
it's
a
long
set
of
procedures.
there
doesn't
necessarily
need
to
be
a
finding
of
a
valid
conviction
if
the
defendant
doesn't
object
at
all.
there's
burden
shifting.
it's
very
complicated.
congress
did
not
apply
it
to
the
immigration
code
by
its
terms.
it's
not
applicable
to
the
states
by
its
terms.
what
the
court
said
in
lopez
in
saying,
in
footnote
6,
that
recidivist
possession
counts
as
punishable
under
the
csa,
it
pointed
to
section
844,
which
defines
the
penalties
available
and
not
anything
about
procedures.
and
even
conviction--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
that
--
that
raises
a
very
narrow
question
that,
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
has
never
been
addressed
in
the
immigration
context,
which
is
whether
there
could
be
a
proceeding
to
challenge
the
narrow
question
of
a
conviction
obtained
in
the
complete
absence
of
counsel.
this
court
said
in
custis
that
there
--
even
though
there
is
a
very
broad
general
rule
that
prior
convictions
are
presumed
valid,
that
in
one
narrow
situation,
the
complete
absence
of
counsel,
that
a
due
process
type
challenge
could
be
brought.
now,
that
question
has
never
been
raised
in
this
case,
whether
such
a
challenge
could
be
brought
in
immigration
proceedings
despite
the
general
rule
that
there
are
no
such
collateral
challenges,
but
that
is
a
different
rule
and
a
different
body
of
jurisprudence
from
this
court,
the
due
process
body,
as
opposed
to
importing
all
of
the
very
complicated
section
851
procedures
into
the
--
the
--
the
inquiry
here.
and
just
to
get
back
to
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes,
i
think
that
they're
potentially
distinguishable.
but,
you
know,
this
is
--
this
is
not
a
question
that
has
ever
come
up
in
the
immigration
context.
it
would
be
a
special
rule
that
would
be
based
on
the
court's
decision,
we
think,
in
custis
and
not
anything
about
851
procedures.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes,
but
i
think
recidivism
--
i
think
there's
some
confusion
in
the
court's
discussion,
perhaps,
that
recidivism
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
you're
never
convicted
of
recidivism.
you're
convicted
of
an
offense,
and
you
might
be
subject
to
an
increased
punishment
for
that
offense
because
you
are
a
recidivist.
and
that's
essentially
what
petitioner
wants
here,
is
to
define
the
state
court
offense
as
having
an
element
of
recidivism,
but
there
is
one
thing
that's
clear
from
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
this
point
is
that
recidivism
is
separate
and
unique
from
anything
else
that
might--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that
recidivism
is
separate
and
unique?
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
almendarez-torres
would
be
one.
the
court's
decision
in
rodriquez
would
be
another.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
what
this
court
said
in
rodriguez
generally
about
recidivist
punishments
is
you're
always
being
punished
for
the
last
offense,
but
you're
being
punished
more
severely
because
it's
shown
that
incapacitation
and
deterrence
isn't
working
for
you.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
and
what
--
what
i'm
suggesting
about
that
state
statute
is
that
--
and
this
court
said
this
in
lopez
--
that
congress
didn't
want
those
variations
in
state
law
to
change
the
treatment
for
individual
offenders.
what
it
wanted,
and
it
did
this
in
aggravated
felony
provisions,
all
throughout
them,
is
to
identify
categories
of
persons
who
had
done
certain
conduct
that
congress
thought
was
serious
enough
and
treat
them
all
the
same
for
immigration
purposes.
and
the
court
said
in
lopez,
we're
not
going
to
make
the
way
that
state
law
treats
recidivism
--
or
we're
not
going
to
make
state
law
treats
an
offense
change
the
outcome.
the
outcome
is
going
to
be
based
on
how
federal
law
treats
the
offense.
and
that's
why,
to
get
back
to
one
of
my
earlier
answers
to
your
questions,
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
nijhawan
is
extremely
important
here,
because
what
the
court
recognized
in
that
decision
is
that
congress,
in
defining
an
aggravated
felony,
sometimes
talks
about
required
elements
of
the
offense,
and
it
sometimes
talks
about
extra
facts
that
can
be
established
in
the
immigration
court.
in
nijhawan,
there
was
a
fraud
or
deceit
offense
with
this
extra
fact
of
this
loss
amount
of
$10,000
or
more.
and
congress
did
the
same
thing
in
this
provision.
they
had--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
we
think
that
that
refers
to
the
first
part
of
the
definition.
there
are
actually
two
parts
of
the
definition.
this
is
i
think
on
page
--
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
if
you
look
at
page
1a
of
the
gray
brief.
you
know,
there
are
two
different
parts
here.
in
43(b),
there
is
"illicit
trafficking
in
a
controlled
substance.
"
"including
a
drug
trafficking
crime,
as
defined
in
section
924(c).
"
so
this
--
this
first
part,
illicit
trafficking,
is
like
a
generic
burglary
type
offense
where
you
need
to
just
look
at
whether
the
--
essentially
elements
correspond
under
a
modified
categorical
approach.
but
then
the
second
part
of
it,
the
drug
trafficking
crime,
is
the
one
that's
defined
as
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
and
when
you
look
at
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
which
this
court
interpreted
in
lopez
as
a
--
an
offense
that
is
punishable
as
a
felony
under
federal
law,
it
is
just
like
nijhawan.
it
is
an
offense
with
a
certain
extra
fact.
in
nijhawan,
it
was
a
fraud--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--and
deceit
offense.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes,
and
i
think
that's
because
congress
has
said
when
it
wants
the
--
the
timing
to
matter.
for
example,
in
the
end
of
the
aggravated
felony
definitions,
congress
said
it
didn't
want
felony
convictions
that
were
more
than
15
years
old
to
matter.
you
know,
congress
--
when
it
wants
something
old
not
to
matter,
it
says
so,
an
older
conviction.
so
we
don't
think
that
there
would
be
a
difference
for
that
purpose.
so
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i've
answered
the
question.
we
just
think
this
is
like
that
situation
where
you
have
a
conviction
for
a
certain
type
of
offense,
which
here
is
drug
possession,
and
an
extra
fact,
how
it's
punishable
in
federal
court,
and
that
extra
fact
can
be
established
in
immigration
court.
it's
not
the
kind
thing
that
this
court
has
said
under
almendarez-torres
needs
to
be
treated
like
an
offense
element.
i
should
note
that
--
and
this
is
the
point
you
made,
justice
breyer,
that
there
was
not
a
recidivist
enhancement
available
in
texas
court.
justice
kennedy,
that
just
highlights
some
of
the
problems
that
you
identified
in
terms
of
the
wide
variations
that
we
would
see
in
how
similarly
situated
people
who
have
done
the
same
things,
two
drug
possession
offenses,
would
be
treated
differently
under
the
immigration
laws.
and
that's
just
not
what
congress
intended.
we
talk
in
our
brief
--
and
there's
a
long
list
of
differences
in
state
laws,
not
only
in
the
state
procedures,
which
vary
widely
from
federal
court,
but
in
the
state
laws
in
terms
of,
you
know,
if
you
can
consider
a
second
possession
offense
for
recidivist
enhancement,
or
only
a
third
or
fourth;
whether
the
first
offense
has
to
be
final,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
that
there
--
these
differences
would
just
lead
to
a
--
a
patchwork
application
laws
of
the
immigration
laws,
and
if
there's
any
place
where
we
don't
want
that,
it's
--
it's
in
immigration,
with
respect
to
immigration
consequences.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
you
might
be
thinking
of
his
prior
offense
for
domestic
violence.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that
that
may
have
been
able
to
be
used
to
--
to
enhance
his
--
his
drug
crime
to
an
enhanced
sentence,
but
that
--
there
wasn't
an
enhancement
sought
on
that.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that
was
a
--
a
2003
conviction.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
in
neither
case
does
the
prosecutor's
judgment
matter.
what
matters
is
the
offense
conduct
that
was
established
by
the
conviction
in
state
court.
what
matters
is
the
offense
that
the
person
was
convicted
of
and
if
that
corresponds
to
a
federal
offense
that
was
punishable
as
a
felony
in
federal
court.
it
is
true
that
some
charges
may
be
brought
and
some
charges
may
not
be
brought,
and
that
would
impact
what
a
person
has
been
convicted
of.
so
there
could
be
disparities
based
on
that.
but
what
congress
decided
was
that
it
had
to
balance
its
need
for
uniformity
with
a
rule
that
is
administrable,
and
the
rule
that
it
picked
as
administrable
is,
let's
look
at
the
offense
conduct
that
was
established
by
the
conviction.
and
when
you
look
at
that
offense
conduct,
you
have
to
ask
how
it
could
be
punished
in
federal
court.
and
it's
that
"punishable"
language
that
requires
this
more
hypothetical
inquiry
on
how
the
events
--
how
the
offense
could
be
treated.
and
just
to
summarize,
it
is
clear
from
the
last
20
years
that
congress
has
had
a
very
serious
concern
about
recidivist
criminal
aliens
in
the
united
states,
and
congress
has
made
a
judgment
since
1970
in
the
drug
laws
that
two
drug
possession
offenses
should
be
punishable
as
a
felony.
and
under
those
circumstances,
a
person
who
concededly
has
committed
those
two
drug
offenses
and
who
concededly,
if
taken
to
federal
court,
could
have
been
punished
as
a
felony,
just
should
not
be
able
to
escape
the
aggravated
felony
designation
that
congress
intended
for
all
aliens
who
are
similarly
situated.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
submit
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
