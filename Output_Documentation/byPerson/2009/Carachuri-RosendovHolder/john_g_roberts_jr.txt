carachuri-rosendo
v.

mr.

g.
roberts,

under
the
applicable
state
law,
what's
required
before
the
recidivist
sentence
is
triggered?
is
it
a
formal
finding
of
recidivism
by
the
--
by
a
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
the
state
prosecutors
often
prosecute
when
they
have
a
recidivist
provision
under
that,
rather
than
the
much
more
difficult
illicit
trafficking
crime.
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
go
to
jail
for
a
certain
amount
of
years
for
a
recidivist
possession,
that's
easier
to
show
than
illicit
trafficking.
