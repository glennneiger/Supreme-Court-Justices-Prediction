justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
elements
would
a
state
conviction
have
to
contain
to
qualify
as
a
finding
of
recidivism
in
your
view?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
what
would
have
had
to
have
been
determined
in
a
state
conviction
for
you
to
recognize,
under
your
argument,
that
it
would
qualify
as
a
felony
under
the
controlled
substances
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
know
of
any
state
law
that
is
analogous
to
the
federal
law,
precisely
analogous?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
--
to
get
to.
what
are
the
elements
of
that
finding?
what
exactly
--
because
different
labels
are
attached
to
different
crimes
that
qualify
you
for
recidivism
under
some
state
statutes,
et
cetera.
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
articulate
what
finding
of
recidivism
counts,
what
are
the
underlying--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
court
now,
the
state
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
arguing
that
a
state
court
has
to
make
a
finding
of
a
valid
prior
conviction;
is
that
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
has--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
you're
telling
us--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
something's
not
a
federal
felony
and
it's
now
subject
--
because
he
hasn't
been
convicted
in
federal
court
of
recidivism
--
now
he's
being
punished
under
the
ina
or
removed
under
the
ina
for
what
is
not
a
felony
under
federal
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
just
ask
you
one--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--under
the
federal--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--under
the
federal
statute,
it's
only
punishable
on
--
for
recidivism
purposes
if
the
prior
conviction
was
valid,
because,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
the
statute
permits
a
defendant
to
object.
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
proving
validity
is
irrelevant.
it's
not
punishable
as
recidivism
unless
the
prior
conviction
was
valid,
constitutionally
valid.
so
why
isn't
that
same
standard
or
proof
thereof
required
either
in
the
state
conviction
under
your
--
under
any
theory,
or
by
the
ij?
the
ij
fails
to
make
that
finding,
how
has
he
and
on
what
basis
has
he
ruled
that
there
was
a
valid
prior
conviction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
only
under
a
process
that
requires
notice--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
you
would
suggest,
then,
that
even
if
a
prior
state
court
conviction
was
secured
without
the
advice
of
counsel,
that
would
qualify
as
a
federal
offense
of
recidivism.
so
let's
assume
this
case,
that
in
neither
the
conviction
for
the
one
marijuana
stick
or
the
conviction
for
the
one
sleeping
pill,
that
if
those
convictions
were
secured
without
the
advice
of
counsel,
that
would
be
enough
to
qualify
him
as
a
recidivist
under
the
federal
law.
