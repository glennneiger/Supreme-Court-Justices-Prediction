justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there's
some
that
can't
be
found.
so
if
we
take
your
position,
there's
some
that
can't
be
found,
we
just
can't
create
our
database.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
the
problem
that's
underlying
the
fairness
of
this
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
terms
of
if
we
take
your
approach,
no
matter
how
hard
it
is
to
find
owners,
you
are
just
out
of
luck.
that
is
to
say,
there
will
not
be
databases
collected,
because
they
cannot
be
complete
because
we
cannot
find
the
owner.
if
we
take
the
position
that
it
is
sometimes
waiverable,
that
obstacle
disappears
and
now
it's
a
question
of
the
fairness
of
the
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
i
just
wonder
why
congress
would
have
ever
wanted
this
kind
of
provision
to
serve
as
that
kind
of
obstacle
in
any
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
underlying
fairness.
there
might
be
--
maybe
they
will
win
on
that.
i
don't
know
what
the
merits
of
that
are.
but
certainly
an
absolute
bar
might
sometimes
help
some
copyright
owners,
but
many
times
it
will
hurt
them,
because
since
they
can't
be
found
they
can't
be
compensated.
and
if
we
set
up
a
system
and
put
some
money
in
it,
so
if
they
are
ever
found
they
will
be
compensated,
that
will
help
them.
so
that's
why
i
ask
the
question,
why
would
a
congress,
that
wants
to
help
copyright
owners
create
this
kind
of
system?
when
all
the
things
you
are
talking
about
can
be
brought
into
play
when
we
consider
the
fairness
of
the
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
wouldn't
waive
it
then.
i
mean,
the
problem,
i
take
it,
realistically
is
this:
let's
take
a
group
of
people
who
want
to
make
databases;
now
they
want
to
use
copyrighted
material.
there
is
a
subset
of
people
who
have
written
it
they
can't
find,
so
they
say
here's
what
we
will
do.
we
will
take
$100
billion,
and
we
will
put
it
in
a
fund,
and
like
ascap,
that
fund
can
administer
this
money
for
the
benefit
of
anyone
who
turns
up.
now,
maybe
that's
illegal
under
some
law.
maybe
the
class
isn't
right.
maybe
they
can't
get
proper
representation.
maybe
it's
inadequate,
et
cetera.
but
what
i
don't
fail
to
see
--
what
i
fail
to
see,
is
how
--
whether
you
could
do
that
or
not
do
it
has
anything
to
do
with
registration,
because
we
are
talking
about
the
people
who
aren't
here,
all
of
whom,
if
you
ever
bring
suit
when
he's
found,
will
register
the
copyright.
the
only
reason
they
haven't
registered,
we
don't
know
who
they
are,
that's
why.
maybe
they
have
registered,
for
all
we
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
they
can't
do
that
because
it
would
be
an
unfair
result.
but
where
is
it
in
this
provision
of
law
that's
designed
to
stop
that
ever
from
happening?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
it
won't,
by
the
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
depends
on
what
the
terms
of
the
settlement
are.
we
could
have
a
subclass
that
allows
a
subset
of
those
people
to
come
into
court.
no
reason
you
couldn't.
so
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
it's
true
that
they
won't
register
when
they
are
found.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
1909
congress
thought
all
this
through
with
the
databases
and
so
forth?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
doesn't
it?
just
out
of
curiosity.
you
are
making
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
you
say
if
somebody
who
owns
the
copyright.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
no.
but
what
we
want
to
do
is
we
want
to
have,
in
our
database,
all
of
the
material
written
about
slavery,
and,
lo
and
behold,
there
are
4,000
books
that
we
can't
trace.
who,
now,
owns
the
copyright
100
years
later?
and
there
is
no
way
to
get
those
into
our
database.
whether--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
now,
that's
a
sort
of
loss,
and
my
same
point,
that
maybe
that's
as
it
should
be,
but
it's
rather
surprising
that
this
law
is
the
law
that
will
answer
that
question.
