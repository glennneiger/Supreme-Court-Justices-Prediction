mr.
charles
s.
sims
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
circuit's
decision
vacating
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
a
settlement
agreement
that
compensated
authors
for
all
their
arguably
infringed
works
in
the
face
of
congress's
direction
that
federal
district
courts
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
any
civil
action
arising
under
copyright
is
wrong
for
three
reasons.
first,
even
--
first,
the
decision
is
incorrect
under
the
unanimous
holding
three
years
ago
in
arbaugh
that
where
congress
affords
unqualified
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
other
statutory
provisions
argued
to
be
jurisdictional
that
do
not
clearly
restrict
that
jurisdiction
won't
be
deemed
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
well,
arbaugh
relied
heavily
on
the
zipes
case,
and
the
zipes
involved
a
statutory
threshold
condition
much
like
the
one
here.
you
couldn't
bring
a
title
vii
action
unless
you
filed
a
particular
kind
of
piece
of
paper
with
the
eeoc.
and
zipes
and
arbaugh
both
held
that
those
statutory
conditions
or
essential
ingredients
were
not
jurisdictional,
and
the
court
relied,
heavily
i
think,
on
the
fact
that
jurisdiction
was
separately
provided
for
and
the
provisions
at
issue
weren't.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
that,
even
putting
the
clear
statement
rule
of
arbaugh
to
one
side,
statutory
text,
structure,
purpose
and
history
all
point
to
classifying
411(a)
as
mandatory
but
not
jurisdictional.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
well,
the
court
did
apply
--
reiterate
and
apply
the
arbaugh
rule
in
the
rockwell
case
with
respect
to
a
provision
that
had
predated
arbaugh,
and
nothing
in
arbaugh
said
that.
but
in
any
event,
our
second
point
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
traditional
indicia
of
not
only
text
but
also
structure,
history
and
purpose,
this
provision
should
be
ranked
as
mandatory
but
not
jurisdictional.
and
the
third
point
i
want
to
get
to--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--justice
ginsburg,
we
certainly
agree
with
the
government
with
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals.
with
respect
to
the
district
court,
on
the
one
hand,
my
clients
don't
--
are
satisfied
with
the
government's
position.
on
the
other
hand,
as
justice
scalia's
decision,
i
think,
in
day
v.
mcdonough
pointed
out,
the
traditional
default
rule
really
is
that
defenses
are
up
to
defendants
to
raise.
in
this
particular
kind
of
situation
where
there
is
no
reason
at
all,
i
think,
to
suspect
that
defense
counsel
will
not
raise
411
whenever
--
none
of
the
cases
that
ms.
merritt
raises
for
example,
involve
situations
of
waiver,
where
the
issues
weren't
raised
until
the
court
of
appeals
--
i
think
that
the
court
can
rely,
frankly,
on
defendants
and
on
the
ability
of
district
judges
to
nudge
defense
counsel
when
they
need
nudging.
but
if
the
court
felt
that
the
provision
was
important
enough
so
that
it
wanted
to
impose
on
district
courts
the
obligation
of
strict
policing,
i
think
it
could.
but
as
i
say,
i
have
been
practicing
copyright
law
for
25
years;
i've
never
seen
a
defendant
who
either
missed
a
defense
or
chose
not
to
raise
it.
the
third
point
i
want
to
raise
if
there
is
time
is
simply
that,
even
if
411(a)
were
deemed
jurisdictional
at
the
outset
of
the
case
with
respect
to
its
language
which
talks
about
instituting,
nothing
in
either
its
text
or
purpose
suggests
that
congress
meant
to
deprive
district
courts
of
their
usual
power
to
settle
cases
with
respect
to
approving
settlement
agreements.
in
this
case,
because
the
plaintiffs
complied
with
411(a)
at
the
front
door
by
alleging
properly
that
they
had
complied
with
the
obligation,
we
think
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
send
the
parties
to
mediation
and
then
necessarily
to
approve
the
agreement
they
returned
with
three
years
later.
now
with
respect
to--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--i
don't
understand
the
amicus
to
be
making
that
argument.
if
your
honor
is
referring
to--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--the
third
--
the
third
sentence
of
411(a),
i
think
that's
the
principal
argument
she
makes
as
to
why
this
satisfies
arbaugh
and
we
think,
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
third
sentence
of
411(a)--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
--
because
of
the
way
411(a)
is
phrased,
dismissals
under
411(a),
whether
we
are
correct
that
it's
not
jurisdictional
or
whether
they
are
correct
that
it
is,
i
think
ordinarily--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--without
prejudice--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--absolutely.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
that's
the
nature
of
this
requirement.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
yeah.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
with
respect
to
the
arbaugh--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--the
problem
in
this
case,
and
really
the
reason
why
the
settlement
agreement
has
turned
out
the
way
it
did
is
there
is
no
effective--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--there
is
no
effective
statute
of
limitations
in
these
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
well--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--in
--
in
a
case
where
the
infringement
is
the
existence
of
something
on
the
web,
then
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
effectively,
because
the
argument
would
be
that
the
making
available
is
an
infringement.
we
don't
think
that
the
last
sentence
of
411(a)
satisfies
arbaugh
or
indeed
is
--
is
any
evidence
toward
this
being
jurisdictional.
the
last
sentence
was
inserted,
as
the
history
makes
perfectly
clear,
to
solve
the
problem
created
by
the
vacheron
decision
that
the
second
circuit
had
decided
in
1958.
and
in
that
case,
what
justice
--
judge
hand
had
done,
and
other
courts
have
done
it,
too,
is
to
say
it
is
--
district
courts
cannot
review
the
registrar's
action
in
denying
registration,
and
that
has
to
be
done
in
a
separate
mandamus
action,
at
that
point
in
washington,
d.c.--
so
the
lesson
simply
is
congress's
way
of
saying
very
clearly:
we
want
to
get
rid
of
that
rigamarole
and
we
want
to
allow
all
this
to
be
done
efficiently.
but
the
statement
that
this
could
be
done
even
if
the
registrant
didn't
show
up
is
not
at
all
any
statement,
much
less
a
clear
statement,
that
this
was
intended
to
be
jurisdictional.
now--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
we
made
that
argument.
we
did
--
we
did
issue,
we
did
say
that
sentence
in
one
or
two
places,
and
the
argument--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--but
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
different,
because
the
issue
in
the
district
court
was
the
fairness,
reasonableness
and
adequacy
of
the
settlement
and
there
was
an
attack
on
the
different
valuation
for
unregistered
claims.
in
that
context
we
relied
on
411(a).
the
argument
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
had
we
said,
as
we
should
have,
that
411(a)
is
mandatory
but
not
jurisdictional.
we
were
guilty
of
exactly
the
loose
language
that
this
court
was
guilty
of
in
robinson
and
smith,
as
it
pointed
out
in
eberhart
or
kontrick.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
but
as
--
but
as
the
court
decision
in
that
case
said,
there
was
no
need
to
overrule
robinson
or
smith
because
really
what
was
going
on
there
was
the
court
had
been
saying
the
rule
was
mandatory,
and
the
additional
language
that
was
jurisdictional
was
loose
language.
our
argument
never
focused
on
the
ranking
of
411(a).
it
was
always
rooted
in
the
existence
of
the
rule
which
did
justify,
and
on
the
merits
of
the
appeal
back
in
the
second
circuit
we
will
again
argue
did
justify,
a
different
valuation
of
the
claim.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
not
all
the
courts--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--your
honor,
the
first
court
of
appeals
which
said
that
411(a)
said
--
not
held
--
was
jurisdictional
was
in
1990.
that's
well
after
the
1976
act,
and
the
original
act
had
been
--
i
mean,
the
1909
act,
which
it
was
patterned
after,
had
been
nearly
100
years
earlier.
there
was
no
court
of
appeals
that
ever
said
that
the
1909
act
was
jurisdictional,
and
when
this
court
had
that
case
in
the
washingtonian
case
in
the
1930s,
there
was
no
reference
to
it
being
jurisdictional
by
either
the
majority
or
the
dissent.
and
i
think
washingtonian
is
particularly
interesting
because
there
the
district
court
had
originally
held
that
it
was
jurisdictional
and
then
sua
sponte
recanted
a
few
days
later
and
issued
another
position.
and
that
is
in
the
record
of
this
court
in
washingtonian
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
professor
ben
kaplan
in
the
report
to
the
register
and
to
congress
in
connection
with
the
1976
act.
so
the
issue
was
raised
for
people
to
think
about
if
anybody
had.
but
congress
did
not
in
1976
or
at
any
time
earlier
say
that
this
was
intended
to
be
jurisdictional
or
was
jurisdictional.
so
if
--
if
passing
the
arbaugh
argument
with
respect
to
text,
structure,
history
and
purpose
--
the
structure
i
think
is
particularly
telling,
because
in
this
case
the
provision
of
jurisdiction
is
in
title
28,
the
provision
of
registration
is
in
the
copyright
act.
they've
been
separated--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--i
don't
think
the
court
said
that.
i
think
that
the
court
said
that
in
bowles
with
respect
to
time
limits
for
appeal.
i
think
bowles
is
quite
clearly
limited
to
time
limits
for
appeal,
and
the
court's
decision
rested
on
--
heavily
on
stare
decisis.
with
respect
to--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--but
this
doesn't
involve
a
time
limit.
this
involves,
as
arbaugh
and
zipes
did,
ingredients
of
the
claim,
preconditions
to
the
claim,
threshold
steps
with
respect
to
the
claim,
and
i
think
there
is
no
reason
for
the
arbaugh
approach
not
to
apply.
but
in
any
event
the
structure
is
telling
here;
the
language
is
telling
as
well.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
i
think
not,
chief
justice
roberts.
the
language
here
has
been
used
in
copyright
statutes
in
1831,
as
our
reply
brief
points
out,
and
includes
the
language
for
statutes
of
limitation
and
for
copyright
notice.
and
all
of
those
have
always
been
deemed
mandatory.
none
of
them
has
been
deemed
jurisdictional.
again,
section
507
of
the
copyright
act,
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
here,
has
almost
exactly
the
same
language
as
in
411.
john
r.
sand
i
think
the
court
treated
as
in
bowles--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--well,
john
r.
sand
involved
a
special
situation
of
suits
against
the
government
and
considerations
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
well,
i
think
john
r.
sand
held
that
provision
was
jurisdictional,
but
i
think
the
decision
went
off
on
--
on
stare
decisis,
and
the
fact
that
the
court
had,
with
respect
to
the
tucker
act
and
matters
of
suits
against
the
government,
taken
a
different
position.
those,
i
think,
are
really
the
only
carve-outs,
the
statutory
time
limits
for
appeal
and
suits
against
the
government,
from
the
general
arbaugh
rule.
so
here
congress
has
used
this
language
repeatedly.
this
court's
own
forms
for
copyright
infringement,
which
were
first
promulgated
in
the
1930s,
have
patterned
our
argument
and
are
contrary
to
the
amicuses'.
they
have
always
treated
the
registration
provision
of
the
model
complaint
differently
from
the
jurisdictional
provisions.
those
are
in
separate
sections,
not
next
to
each
other
even.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
you
do.
the
federal
rule--
[laughter]
mr.
charles
s.
sims
and
because
they
haven't
changed
very
much
in
70
years,
you
probably
haven't
spent
much
time
with
them.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
yes.
it
was
originally
form
17.
we
have
gone
through
the
history.
but
i
think
there
is
really
only
one
change
and
in
every
respect
it
is
identical
to
what
it
was
in
1938.
and,
again,
as
i
say,
it
separates
out
the
registration
provision
from
the
jurisdictional
provision.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
make
registration
jurisdictional,
it
would
have
been
extraordinarily
easy
to
do
so.
all
they
would
have
had
to
add
at
the
beginning
of
411(a)
is
"notwithstanding
anything
in
1338
and
1331.
"
we
have
--
we
have
included
in
our
brief
as
an
appendix
about
60-odd
federal
statutes,
which
carved
out
jurisdiction
otherwise
provided
by
1331
or
other
provisions,
and
411(a)
looks
nothing
like
them.
they
all
look,
roughly,
like
each
other.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
well,
not
--
not
quite.
there
were
--
there
were
ten
authors
who
objected,
i
mean,
as
a
group,
and
they
wanted
more
money
for
unregistered
authors.
there
were,
needless
to
say,
tens
of
thousands
of
other
authors
who
didn't
object,
but
it
is
true
that
the
objectors
wanted
--
thought
that
they
had
gotten
a
bad
deal.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
i--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--well,
they
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
whether
the
objectors
had
any
registered
works.
i
know
that
the
named
plaintiffs
had
more
unregistered
works
than
registered
works.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
yes.
this
is
not
a
situation--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
fairness
of
the
settlement.
i
think
we
are
here
because
the
second
circuit
blew
up
the
settlement
and
said
we
can't
settle
this
case,
and
the
only
way
it
was
settleable
was
to
give
the
publishers
and
the
databases
complete
peace
by
clearing
all
off
of
this
off.
and
so--
mr.
charles
s.
sims
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
but
the
--
the
adequacy
and
fairness
of
the
settlement
is
back
in
the
second
circuit
on
remand.
mr.
charles
s.
sims
thank
you,
your
honor.
i,
first,
want
to
correct
the
misimpression
given
that
the
databases
think
they
are
special.
the
databases
haven't
thought
they
don't
need
to
get
permission.
they
thought
they
had
permission
under
section
201(c),
and
this
court
had
the
case
and
decided
--
two
of
you
believed
we
were
right,
and
more
of
you
believed
we
were
wrong,
but
the
databases
took
no
position
that
they
had
no
obligation.
they
got
the
rights
by
contract
from
the
publishers,
with
representations
and
warranties,
and
that's
why,
when
this
case
was
instituted,
they
went
to
mediation.
they
resolved
this
in
a
way.
they
got
money
from
the
publishers,
who
were
exposed
under
representations
and
warranties.
the
authors
were
represented
by
the
three
major
national
freelance
author
groups
in
the
country,
and
this
was
a
way,
we
thought,
to
address
this
problem
responsibly
and
without
taking
the
court's
time.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
roberts,
you
said
a
couple
of
times
that
you
wonder
whether
the
language
here,
v.
bock,
which,
i
think
--
if
i
am
remembering,
you
authored,
but,
in
any
event,
it
was
within
a
year
or
two,
said
that
was
boilerplate
language
used
all
the
time
for
statutes
of
limitations
that
are
not
jurisdictional.
and,
indeed,
that
is
correct.
in
the
footnote
of
our
reply
brief,
we
list
three
times
in
the
19th
century
when
that
very
language
was
used
for
statutes
of
limitations.
and,
if
you
put
it
into
lexis
or
westlaw,
you
will
get
a
zillion
statutes
with
respect
to
--
exhaust
nonjurisdictional
statutes.
so
i
think,
quite
to
the
contrary,
that
--
that
is
the
language
congress
uses
when
it
wants
something
to
be
not
jurisdictional.
now,
ms.
merritt
began
with
the
word
411(a).
i
want
to
be
clear.
this
case
was
instituted
in
compliance
with
411(a).
the
named
plaintiffs
registered
their
works
and
came
into
court.
it
went
to
mediation,
and
the
next
thing
the
court
knew,
it
had
a
settlement
agreement
to
review,
and
it
did
review
under
rule
23.
she
relies
on
the
hallstrom
case,
but,
of
course,
the
hallstrom
case,
which
did
avoid
saying
whether
it
was
mandatory
or
jurisdictional,
involved
the
enforcement
of
a
mandatory
--
at
least
mandatory
rule,
on
the
application
of
a
party,
and
that's
what
the
court
does,
and
that's
why,
to
some
extent,
other
than
with
respect
to
settlement
agreements,
this
case
doesn't
matter
a
lot
because
the
defendants
will
always
be
raising
this
defense.
