justice
ruth
bader

do
you
agree
with
the
--
with
the
government
that
it's
mandatory
for
the
district
court
but
prohibited
to
the
court
of
appeals?
the
government
has
this
hybrid
where,
because
of
the
public
purposes
served
by
registration,
not
only
can
but
the
district
court
should
raise
the
failure
to
register
on
its
own,
but
then
the
government
says
once
you
have
a
final
judgment
in
district
court,
it's
no
longer
open
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
raise
it
on
its
own.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
do
you
say
it's
for
the
defendants
to
raise,
and
if
they
don't
raise
it,
too
bad?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sims,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
you
have
taken
inconsistent
positions.
that
is,
back
in
the
district
court
before
there
was
a
settlement,
you
urged
before
the
district
court
that
411(a)
was
a
jurisdictional
bar
and
that
that
precluded
certifying
a
class
that
included
the
non-registered
copyright
holders.
you
did
make
that
argument
in
the
district
court,
and
now
you
are
saying
--
you
are
confessing
error,
that
was
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
argument--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
still
it's
a
statute
and
didn't
this
court
say
in
bowles
that
a
statutory
qualification
on
the
right
to
sue
is
generally
jurisdictional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
they
made
a
distinction
to
distinguish
the
other
cases,
the
one
--
i
forgot
--
the
one
involving
criminal
rule
33,
on
the
ground,
well,
that's
a
court
rule,
but
when
congress
makes
the
qualification
then
it's
jurisdictional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
court
said
it
was
mandatory.
i
don't
remember
when
they
used
the
word
"jurisdictional".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
form
19.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
--
that,
certainly,
would
be
open.
if
you
are
correct
that
the
second
circuit
shouldn't
have
cut
this
off
at
the
threshold
by
saying
it's
jurisdictional,
the
question
of
the
fairness
of
the
settlement
is
what
you
were
contending.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
position
is
that
the
district
court
really
should
have
dismissed
this
case
at
the
outset?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
candid
to
say
that
this
is
in
a
hybrid
category,
that
the
government
was
taking
an
intermediate
position.
do
you
know
of
any
other
provision
where
the
district
court
has
an
obligation
to
raise
the
question
on
its
own
motion
that
is
yet
not
jurisdictional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
very,
very
limited.
i
think
arizona
didn't
say
any
time
there's
--
there's
a
preclusion
plea,
the
court
can
raise
it
on
its
own.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
congressional
reaction
to
the
second
circuit's
decision?
it
provided
that
the
--
there
was
to
be
no
jurisdictional
bar
in
criminal
matters.
didn't
--
it
didn't
affect
jurisdiction
in
criminal
matters,
but
it
didn't
say
anything
about
civil
matters.
so
isn't
that
some
kind
of
reflected
acceptance
that
in
some
of
the
civil
--
in
civil
cases,
it
would
be
jurisdictional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
--
aren't
there
statutes
that
have
exhaustion
requirements,
or
like
the
eeoc
filing
requirement,
that
say,
you
can't
sue
until
you
have
gone
to
x
administrative
agency?
and
those
are
not
considered
jurisdictional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
--
that
last
sentence
is
just
relating
to
the
court
can
--
has
authority
to
decide
this
particular
issue,
copyrightability,
even
though
the
registrant
has
chosen
not
to
enter
the
suit.
the
sentence
simply
says,
court,
you
have
authority
to
decide
this
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
true,
though,
that
--
that
most
copyright
holders,
most
people
who
write
articles,
freelance
articles,
even
if
it's
only
$65,
it's
not
--
it's
not
worth
it
because
they
really
don't
expect
to
get
--
they
don't
think
anybody
is
going
to
infringe,
in
the
first
place,
and
if
they
did
what
establishes
to
be,
just
wouldn't
be
economically
worthwhile?
so
i
think
it's
a
fact
that
most
copyrights
are
not
registered,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
they
--
if
they
are
just
suing,
not
for
money
but
for
an
injunction,
do
they
have
to
register
before
bringing
an
injunction
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
so
mingle
--
rule.
i
think
ms.
anders
answered
that
question.
in
this
situation
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
judge
to
accept
the
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
--
if
we
are
talking
about
the
ordinary
case,
and
someone
sued
for
infringement
apart
from
this
settlement
in
the
context
that
we
are
in,
certainly
it's
not
going
to
raise
that
question
whether
it's
mandatory,
optional
or
whatever.
what
defendant
who
is
sued
for
infringement
wouldn't
say,
judge,
i'm
relying
on
411(a);
they
haven't
registered
their
copyright;
they
can't
sue
me?
i
can't
imagine
a
defendant
in
an
ordinary
copyright
case
who
wouldn't
raise
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
let's
switch
to
the
plaintiff.
if
the
plaintiff
is
in
it
for
money,
for
real
money,
for
damages,
the
plaintiff's
going
to
register
because
then
the
stakes
are
such
that
$65
is
well
worth
it,
if
the
plaintiff
thinks
it
can
get
a
large
infringement
award.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
rulemakers
got
it
wrong
in
form
19,
when
they
did
not
write
411(a)
as
jurisdictional.
they
say
copy
the
1331,
1338,
that
is
jurisdictional,
and
then
they
put
the
certificate
requirement
below
the
line
--
below
the
jurisdictional
line.
so
that
was
--
well,
that
was
wrong,
in
your
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
suppose,
if
you
picked
up
any
copyright
complaint,
you
will
see
the
jurisdictional
allegation
will
say
1331,
1338,
and
nothing
about
411.
