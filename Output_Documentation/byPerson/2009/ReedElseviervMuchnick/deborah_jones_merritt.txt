ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
will
start
with
the
statutory
language
as
the
court
has
been
discussing
for
the
last
half-hour.
section
411(a)
appears
on
page
1
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
it
uses,
first,
the
mandatory
word
"shall"
in
commanding
that
no
action
shall
be
instituted.
it
does
not
contain
a
limitations
period,
as
statutes
of
limitations
do.
it
simply
says,
"no
action
shall
be
instituted".
no
waiver--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--until?
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
that
makes--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--that
makes
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
requirement
that
registration
be
made.
it
is
quite
analogous,
although
stronger
than
the
statute
in
the
hallstrom
case.
the
hybrid
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
was
referring
to
is
the
court's
decision
in
the
hallstrom
case,
which
was
a
provision
of
the
environmental
statutes
that
is
common
in
several
of
those
statutes
providing:
no
action
may
be
commenced
until
a
notice
is
filed.
our
provision
here
is
stronger.
it
says:
"no
action
shall
be
instituted",
instead
of
"no
action
may
be
commenced".
even
if
this
case
is
not
--
even
if
this
statute
does
not
impose
a
jurisdictional
limit,
which
i
will
strongly
argue
that
it
does,
it
at
the
very
least
imposes
a
mandatory
command
like
the
statute
in
hallstrom.
and
there
is
no
reason
in
this
case
to
reverse
the
second
circuit,
even
if
this
is
a
mandatory
provision.
as
you
will
recall,
in
hallstrom,
the
parties
had
gone
through
four
years
of
complicated
environmental
litigation.
went
up
through
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
saying,
you
did
not
comply
with
this
notice
provision.
this
court
held
that
it
did
not
need
to
decide
whether
that
provision
was
jurisdictional
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
term,
because
it
was
at
least
mandatory.
and
the
court
reversed
despite
that
time,
sent
the
case
back.
in
fact,
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
about
whether
the
mandatory
issue
would
be
within
the
court's
grant
of
certiorari.
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
hallstrom
referred
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
the
court
decided
that
rather
than
get
to
the
strict
issue
of
jurisdiction,
it
would
decide
on
a
mandatory
forum.
but
there
is
no
reason,
if
we
are
--
if
the
court
wants
to
avoid
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
to
endorse
the
mandatory
hybrid
one,
the
second
circuit
should
still
be
affirmed
in
this
case.
the
parties
raised
section
411(a)
quite
clearly
to
the
district
court.
they
used
this
provision
as
their
major
defense
of
both
the
substance
of
the
settlement's
fairness
and
the
representation.
the
representation
was
the
major
issue
that
the
objectors
raised
in
the
district
court.
and
so
both
parties,
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants,
argued
in
their
briefs
--
and
it's
simply
not
a
few
sentences;
we've
provided
the
parts
of
the
record
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
--
that
the
reason
that
this
settlement
should
be
upheld
was
because
of
this
mandatory,
they
called
it
then,
jurisdictional
provision.
that
was
an
essential
argument
that
they
made
to
the
district
court
and
that
they
then
repeated
to
the
second
circuit
in
the
merits
briefs
long
before
the
circuit
said,
then:
wait
a
minute;
you
are
making
a
curious
argument
here
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
provision
that
upholds
your
settlement,
but
that
we
still
have
the
ability
to
look
at
this
settlement
if
it's
jurisdictional.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
language
of
section
411(a).
as
i
have
argued,
it
begins
with
this
mandatory
language,
"no
action
shall
be
maintained".
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
many
of
those
statutes
refer
specifically
to
exhaustion.
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
for
example,
that
some
of
the
parties
cite,
refers
specifically
to
exhaustion
of
remedies
after
the
"no
action"
sort
of
language.
every
jurisdictional
statute
has
its
own
language
and
its
own
story.
we
could
say
they
are
like
tolstoy's
unhappy
families;
they
are
all
different.
and
in
this
case,
the
story
of
the
copyright
act
and
its
language
is
very
distinctive,
both
in
the
public
purposes
that
it
furthers
and
in
the
language
that
it
uses.
again,
on
the
statutory
language,
we
have
the
very
mandatory
language,
"no
action
shall
be
instituted".
no
modifiers;
there's
no
provision
for
waiver.
the
solicitor
general's
assistant
mentioned
that
this
statute
is
like
fee
waivers.
it's
not
at
all
like
a
fee
waiver,
because
the
statute
for
fee
waivers
explicitly
gives
the
district
judge
authority
to
waive
the
fee
in
the
case
of
an
in
forma
pauperis
plaintiff.
this
statute
contains
no
waiver
for
the
parties.
it
contains
no
discretion
for
the
district
judge.
and
in
the
last
word
of
--
the
last
sentence
of
this
very
short
three-sentence
provision,
congress
referred
explicitly
to
jurisdiction.
and
i
would
like
to
look
very
closely
at
that
word,
because
any
plain
reading
of
this
section
will
show
--
shows
that
congress
intended
the
entire
provision
to
refer
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
that's
the
most
immediate
reference,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
three
sentences
work
together.
and
if
we
look
at
the
three
sentences,
they
appear
on
the
first
page
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
first
sentence
creates
two
categories
of
cases:
those
that
the
court
may
decide
and
those
it
may
not.
let
us
say
for
now
we
are
not
meaning
what
that
power
is.
we
are
simply
saying
two
categories
of
cases,
one
the
court
may
decide,
the
other
one
it
may
not.
the
second
sentence
then
adds
a
small
group
of
cases
to
this
first
category,
the
one
that
the
court
may
decide.
as
opposing
counsel
mentioned,
congress
did
that
in
response
to
a
particular
case,
the
vacheron
case.
vacheron
itself
was
built
on
a
line
of
cases
holding
that
the
previous
section
like
411(a)
was
a
jurisdictional
limit.
the
reason
that
courts
could
not
consider
a
copy
--
an
application
for
--
a
petition
for
infringement
complaint,
i'm
sorry,
from
a
person
who
had
not
yet
gotten
registration
was
because
they
construed
that
predecessor
as
jurisdictional
and
therefore,
they
had
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
an
infringement
claim
until
this
person
instituted
a
mandamus
suit
and
got
the
certificate
from
the
registrant.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
when
congress
revised
this
statute
in
1976,
it
had
before
it
60
years
already
of
courts
construing
its
language,
no
action
shall
be
maintained,
which
was
the
previous
1909
language
as
a
jurisdictional
limit.
there
had
not
been
any
resistance
to
that
notion.
even
courts
as
early
as
the
1920s
in
the
lumiere
case,
the
second
circuit
did
not
hold
there
was
"jurisdiction",
but
it
held
that
this
provision
was
unwaiverable.
what
the
parties
want
to
do
here,
of
course,
is
to
waive
the
provision.
so
the
language
was
working
quite
nicely
for
congress.
no
action
shall
be
maintained,
they
switched
it
to
instituted
to
make
clear
that
they
meant
at
the
beginning
of
the
action.
there
had
been
a
few
parties
who
had
argued
during
the
early
20th
century
that
if
they
snuck
in
the
door,
they
could
remain
inside
--
or
i'm
sorry,
once
they
got
inside,
they
could
file
the
--
certificate,
and
the
courts
rejected
that,
but
congress
cleared
up
that
particular
problem.
so
congress
knows
that
its
first
sentence
is
working
quite
well.
congress
then
adds
this
second
sentence
to
--
these,
of
course,
are
people
working
with
the
copyright
office,
experts
in
the
area
of
copyright
law.
congress
adds
the
second
sentence
which
adds
the
small
category
of
cases
to
the
ones
that
may
come
before
the
court.
and
then
in
the
final
sentence,
congress
gives
a
clarification
about
that
final
group
of
cases.
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
the
--
congress
made
clear
that
when
the
registrar
decides
not
to
appear
in
these
cases,
the
court
may
still
go
on
and
has
the
power
to
decide
these
cases.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
it
is
not
at
all
a
big
deal,
your
honor.
in
fact,
for
freelance
writers
one
may
register
an
entire
year's
worth
of
work
on
a
single
form
for
$65.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
not
at
all,
your
honor,
because
again,
the
copyright
statute
has
a
different
history
than
other
jurisdictional
statutes.
before
1909,
owners
of
copyright
had
to
dot
every
"i"
and
cross
every
"t"
within
a
limited
period
of
time.
if
they
didn't,
they
lost
their
entire
ownership
in
the
copyright.
what
congress
wanted
to
do
in
1909
was
to
give
copyright
owners
a
longer
period
of
time
to
comply
with
some
of
these
formalities.
but,
it
still
wanted
to
preserve
the
public
interest
that
registration
serves.
we
haven't
talked
yet
about
the
major
public
interest
that
congress
had
in
mind
here.
it
is
ironically
the
very
problem
that
gave
rise
to
this
lawsuit,
trying
to
find
the
owner's
of
copyrighted
works.
before
using
a
copyrighted
work,
any
person
needs
to
find
the
owner
to
ask
permission.
the
electronic
databases
in
this
case
have
argued
that
they
are
somehow
special,
that
because
they
need
to
obtain
many
permissions,
they
shouldn't
have
to
do
it.
universities,
libraries,
archives
obtain
as
many
or
more
permissions
as
electronic
databases
in
every
year.
for
large
universities
like
harvard
university
or
the
ohio
state
university,
we
have
to
obtain
permissions
for
every
article
that
is
distributed
in
course
packs
to
our
students.
if
one
of
those
articles
is
a
freelance
work,
written
by
mr.
muchnick,
for
example,
we
have
to
track
him
down
and
get
his
permission
to
use
that
article.
so
the
registration
system
was
congress's
response
to
this
problem
of
finding
the
owners
of
copyright.
in
this--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--the
beauty,
your
honor,
though,
of
the
solution
that
congress
adopted
with
the
registration,
moving
the
registration
to
a
jurisdictional
element
rather
than
to
an
element
of
the
claim,
as
it
was
in
the
19th
century,
is
that
the
copyright
owner
may
do
this
any
time.
copyright
lasts,
of
course,
for
the
lifetime
of
the
owner
plus
another
70
years
after
death.
sixty-nine
years
after
my
death,
my
heirs
could
register
my
copyright
if
they
are
finding
that
somebody
is
now
making
a
lot
of
money
off
of
my
works.
and
they
could
then
bring
an
infringement
suit
against
that
person.
it's
odd
to
think
of
a
jurisdictional
restriction
as
being
a
looser
element
than
a
claim
element,
but
in
this
particular
story
of
copyright,
it
is.
what
congress
did
was
to
say,
we
want
people
to
own
copyrights
immediately
without
complying
with
formality.
and
in
1976,
congress
even
extended
that
to
unpublished
works,
so
i
already
have
a
copyright
of
the
notes
i
have
in
front
of
me
and
in
the
e-mails
i
print
last
night
and
so
forth.
what
congress
said,
with
this
huge
sea
of
copyrighted
works,
before
somebody
can
bring
an
infringement
action
in
the
federal
court,
we
want
them
to
confer
a
public
benefit.
we
want
them
to
register
the
copyright
so
that
other
people
can
find
the
owner
and
request
permission.
what
will
happen
in
this
case
under
the
terms
of
this
settlement
is
that
the
defendant
who
did
not
take
time
to
find
the
owners
of
these
works,
even
though
the
owners
of
these
works
were
easier
to
find
than
many
of
the
very
elusive
of
works
that
archives
and
historical
societies
search
for,
they
did
not
find
--
look
for
the
owners
because
they
thought
it
would
be
too
difficult.
this
settlement
now
gives
the
defendants
a
perpetual
right
to
use
all
of
those
works
without
ever
identifying
the
owners,
and
without
the
owners
ever
being
identified
on
the
national
copyright
register,
which
is
what
congress
wanted.
if
i
want
to
create
a
competing
database
for
any
of
the
defendants,
i
have
to
undertake
the
arduous
work
of
tracking
down
all
the
owners.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
justice
breyer--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--i'm--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--justice
breyer,
that
concern
exists
for
everybody,
not
just
for
electronic
databases.
in
fact,
there
is
--
the
copyright--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--because
congress
wants
to
protect
the
rights
of
copyright
owners.
congress
has
more
than
200
years'
experience
balancing
these
two
interests.
and,
in
fact,
as
we
speak,
congress
is
considering
orphan
works
legislation
to
address
that
specific
issue.
what
congress
has
--
and
that
legislation
would
apply
to
all
types
of
works,
electronic
databases,
national
archives,
historical
documentaries.
and
what
congress
is
proposing
in
that
legislation
is
quite
illustrative.
congress
says
that
if
somebody
makes
a
diligent
search
and
cannot
find
the
owner,
then
the
person
may
use
the
work--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--this
is
a
--
the
system
that
congress
put
in
play
is,
your
honor,
one
in
which
copyright
owners
have
an
absolute
right
to
control
the
disposition
of
their
works.
that
is
the
current
system,
even
without
getting
to
the
jurisdictional
issue.
congress
may
change
that
disposition,
and
that
is
within
congress's
control.
what
they
have
been
trying
to
do
is
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
copyright
owner
with
the
interest
of
the
public
in
using
works.
and
that
is
the
perennial
challenge
in
copyright
law,
how
to
balance
those
two
interests.
section
411(a)
is
actually
a
vital
cog
as
part
of
that
balance,
because
what
section
411(a)
does
is
it
says
to
the
copyright
owner
don't
worry
about
all
this
business
of
registering
or
anything
else,
you
have
your
copyright,
and
you
will
have
it
for
your
life
plus
70
years.
if
it
ever
becomes
important
to
you
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
then
you
can
register
at
that
time,
come
into
court.
it's
a
deal
that
congress
has
offered
to
copyright
owners
in
order
to
strike
this
particular
balance
between
the
public
interest
and
the
private
interest.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
in
order
to
bring
any
action
--
if
the
injunction
is
based
on
infringement.
so
we're
--
if
the
plaintiff
brings
an
action
for
infringement
and
the
remedy
they
seek
is
an
injunction,
then
the
copyright
must
be
registered
first.
there
are
some
cases
in
the
lower
courts
in
which
we
have
a
plaintiff
who
has
a
longstanding
pattern
of
infringements
that
a
particular
defendant
has
been
engaged
in
against
that
plaintiff.
the
owen
mills
case
is
an
example.
a
local
photography
studio
was
upset
because
a
photo
duplicating
shop
kept
copying
their
copyrighted
photographs.
they
entered
an
action
for
infringement,
had
registered
several
of
the
photographs.
the
court
issued
an
injunction
that
covered
future
works
as
well,
but
those
were
all
works
within
the
same
judicial
controversy.
so
an
injunction
could
reach
further
than
a
single
registered
work
as
long
as
we
are
talking
about
one
single
controversy.
in
this
case
we
don't
have
an
injunction,
we
have
damages,
and
we
have
thousands
of
different
controversies.
as
the
court
knows
the
class
action
rules
do
not
change
the
substantive
law
or
the
rules
of
--
of
jurisdiction.
we
have
here
thousands
of
different
controversies
that
have
been
aggregated
for
convenience
under
rule
23(b)(3),
but
the
court
must
have
jurisdiction
over
each
of
those
controversies.
or
if
we
take
the
alternative
route
of
hallstrom,
the
hybrid
approach,
and
we
say
that
this
is
a
mandatory
requirement.
congress
has
been
quite
clear
about
this
mandatory
requirement,
and
that
mandate
must
be
satisfied
with
respect
to
every
controversy
in
this
class
action.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
it
depends
on
the
brand
of
mandatory,
your
honor.
there
are
in
this
case
three
different
proposals
before
the
court.
i,
as
appointed
amicus
i
have
argued
that
section
411(a)
is
jurisdictional
which
i
think
the
clear
history
and
language
of
the
statute,
which
i
will
still
come
back
to--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--yes,
because
then
the
two
versions
of
mandatory
are
--
the
flavor
of
mandatory
that
the
solicitor
general
urges
is
that
the
district
--
this
is
very
mandatory,
as
in
hallstrom
--
even
if
a
party
doesn't
raise
the
issue,
the
district
court
sua
sponte
should
raise
the
issue
on
its
own.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
that
was
--
that
was
what
ms.
anders
argued.
i
disagree
with
that,
because
the
public
interest
that
congress
has
put
forth
here
would
not
be
satisfied.
the
parties
in
this
case
argue
the
same
public
interests
that
parties
argue
in
every
copyright
case.
the
plaintiffs
in
a
copyright
case
always
argue
that
their
interest
should
be
protected
even
if
they
haven't
complied
with
congress's
mandates.
the
defendants
in
a
copyright
case
always
argue
that
allowing
them
to
copy
the
plaintiffs'
works
would
give
the
public
greater
access
to
those
works.
there
are
no
special
public
interests
here.
in
fact,
the
electronic
databases
in
this
case
have
been
superseded
technologically.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
actually
there
are
quite
a
number,
your
honor,
just
as
there
are
defendants
who
will
waive
statutes
of
limitations.
there
are
times
when
a
defendant
would
rather
have
the
resolution
on
the
merits,
because
that
then
would
not
allow
the
plaintiff
to
come
back
into
court
and
sue
again.
or
the
defendant
--
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
might
have
sued
--
that
you
are
referring
to
--
might
have
sued
for
infringement,
and
the
defendant
wants
to
make
clear
that
it
has
the
right
to
use
this
work.
that
would
then
establish
that
principle
with
this
plaintiff
with
related
works
or
with
other
works.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
many
naive
people
who
believe
that
famous
movies
and
novels
have
infringed
their
freshman
college
essays.
there
are
cases
exactly
like
that
in
the
courts.
and
in
fact
the
case
i
cite
in
the
brief
is
one
in
which
the
author
sued
the
university,
claiming
that
the
department
of
english
obviously
had
released
his
freshman
essay
to
hollywood,
because
this
movie
built
upon
his
fresh
man
essay.
in
those
cases,
and
this
is
another
distinction,
justice
stevens,
between
mandatory
and
jurisdictional,
the
defendant
doesn't
even
have
to
appear.
the
district
court
can
sua
sponte
dismiss
the
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
we
cite
i
believe
seven
or
eight
cases
in
the
brief
where
exactly
that
happened,
including
two
different
cases--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--all
of
the
people
who
haven't
registered
yet,
your
honor,
will
not
be
able
to
bring
suit,
because
the
class
action
will
extinguish
their
claims.
that's
the
important--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--this
provision,
if
we
go
back
to
section--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--right.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
justice
breyer,
once
again
the
copyright
act
itself
already
makes
that
choice
that
no
person
may
--
and
i'm
not
talking
yet
even
about
the
jurisdictional
provision
--
no
person
may
use
another's
copyrighted
work
without
their
permission.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
oh,
yes.
the
database
issue
--
sometime
--
sometimes
--
in
1976,
by
the
way,
congress
did
because
lexis
and
westlaw
existed
before
1976.
the
--
but
the
databases
are
a
red
herring
here.
sometimes,
technology
is
different,
and,
sometimes,
it's
not.
the
library
of
congress
recently
did
a
project
in
which
they
sought
7,000
permissions
for
a
single
project
because
they
were
digitizing
the
letters
of
hannah
arendt.
they
sought
those
permissions.
they
--
if
they
could
not
get
permission,
if
they
couldn't
find
the
author
or
if
they
didn't
get
an
okay
from
the
author,
they
had
to
leave
the
work
off
of
the
web
site
because
they
are
following
copyright
law.
they
have
a
copy
of
the
original
work
that
was
given
to
them
or
that
they
purchased,
and
they
may
display
that,
but,
if
they
are
going
to
make
a
copy
of
the
work,
then
they
have
to
comply
by
copyright
law.
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
the
databases
here
have
been
superseded
by
technology,
and
that
is
another
way
in
which
technology
is
not
--
is
not
different
in
this
case.
it
is
now
possible
for
works
to
be
scanned
in
photographic
form
or
pdf
form
and
put
in
to
electronic
databases
that
are
fully
searchable,
and
that
does
not
violate
copyright
law.
if
you
compare,
for
example,
law
review
articles
on--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--because
it
is
--
it
is
part
of
the
original
collection
--
i'm
sorry.
if
the
--
if
the
publisher
of
the
collected
work
consents
to
that.
i
am
thinking
of
this
case
in
the
new
york
times--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--yes.
but
who
owns--
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
--that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
this
law
relates
to
the
question,
your
honor,
because
this
law
relates
to
the
access
to
the
court.
the
way
it
relates
to
the
question
is
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
give
people
like
you
and
me
information
about
those
copyright
owners,
so
that
we
could
find
the
owner
of
the
book
on
slavery.
and,
as
a
way
to
maintain
that
register,
which
congress
started
in
1790,
it
said,
to
the
authors
of
copyrighted
works,
if
you
want
to
use
our
courts,
the
judicial
powers
of
the
united
states,
you
need
to
confer
this
benefit,
so
that
justice
breyer
could
find
you,
if
he
wants
to
include
your
work
in
the
database.
and
that
was
the
story
that
congress
did.
i
would
like
to
say
just
one
more
word
about
the
word
411(a)
because
we
were
interrupted
there.
the
parties
have
offered
no
convincing
explanation
for
that
word,
other
than
to
show
that
congress
understood
this
whole
provision
was
jurisdictional.
it
refers,
most
immediately,
to
registrability,
but
that
was
not
a
new
issue
in
1976.
courts
have
always
decided
registrability.
and,
as
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
make
clear
to
us,
a
party's
absence
never
deprives
a
court
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
as
the
--
as
the
congress
made
--
i'm
sorry,
as
the
court
made
clear,
in
issuing
those
forms,
they
are
advisory
only,
and
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
intended
to
give
legal
advice
to
counsel
about
what
the
issues
in
the
case
are.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
and
that
is
quite
common,
your
honor,
because,
in
many
situations,
what
congress
has
done
is
given
a
general
grant
of
jurisdiction
in
1331
or
1338
and
then
pulled
it
back
for
a
subcategory
of
cases,
which
is
what
411(a)
does.
in
those
circumstances,
not
just
in
copyright,
but
in
all
sorts
of
areas,
the
complaint
will
plead
jurisdiction
under
the
general
grant
and
then
may
show
that
it
satisfies
the
condition
later.
this
is
--
we
are
not
arguing
that
--
and
the
second
circuit
has
not
argued
that
411(a)
is
a
jurisdictional
grant.
it
is
a
section
that
takes
back
part
of
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
1331
and
1338.
congress
has
more
than
200
years'
experience
working
with
copyright
law,
as
the
questions
today
have
revealed
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
and
the
questions
today
have
revealed
striking
the
balance
between
the
public
and
the
private
interest
is
a
difficult
one.
ms.
deborah
jones
merritt
thank
you
very
much.
