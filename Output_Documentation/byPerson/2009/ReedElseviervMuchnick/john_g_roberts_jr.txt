roberts,

we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-103,
elsevier
v.
muchnick.
mr.
sims.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
a
lot
harder
case
than
arbaugh,
though.
arbaugh
involved
the
definition
of
an
employer
and
then
the
scope
of
the
statute.
this
one
says
no
suit
shall
be
instituted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you
are
right
that
arbaugh
at
least
set
forth
a
clear
statement
rule,
but
i
think
that's
significant
only
going
forward.
i
don't
know
that
congress,
when
it
passed
this
provision,
could
have
been
aware
of
the
clear
statement
rule
that
arbaugh
articulated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
are
talking
about
the
language,
what
about
john
r.
sand
&
gravel?
that
said
we
held
it
was
jurisdictional
when
the
statute
said:
"suits
shall
be
barred".
the
language
here
is
"no
suit
shall
be
instituted".
that
sounds
pretty
close.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that
was
--
that
was
a
statute
of
limitations
provision,
right?
it
shall
be
barred
after
six
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
forms
for
copyright
infringement
actions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
live
and
learn.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
anders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
discussion
of
that,
including
in
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg
and
in
your
brief,
do
you
think
that
that's
within
the
question
presented,
rephrased?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
an
example
of
the
non-ordinary
case?
i
mean,
you
seem
to
say,
either
--
i
guess
it's
not
always
after
judgment
that
it
shouldn't
be
implemented,
i
guess.
but
when
wouldn't
it
be
after
judgment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
more
--
so
it's
more
or
less
jurisdictional
after
judgment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
really
are,
in
our
recent
decisions,
it
seems
to
me,
two
different
lines
of
authority.
there
is
the
bowles
and
the
john
r.
sand
and
gravel,
which
treats
these
sorts
of
things
as
jurisdictional,
and
the
arbaugh
line
that
doesn't.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
language
here,
"no
suit
shall
be
instituted",
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
"suit
shall
be
barred",
or
the
other
language
in
--
in
bowles.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
anders.
ms.
merritt?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
cut
against
you
in
the
sense
that
the
same
paragraph
congress
used
the
word
"jurisdiction",
but
they
didn't
use
that
in
the
provision
that
you
are
arguing,
does
deprive
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
very
big
deal
to
register
your
copyright,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
--
but
--
but
doesn't
that
mean
that
it
would
be
odd
to
make
jurisdiction
over
an
action
for
infringement
hinge
on
whether
you've,
you
know,
dotted
an
"i"
and
crossed
a
"t"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
sims,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
merritt,
you
were
appointed
by
this
court
as
an
amicus
to
defend
the
judgment
below,
and
you
have
ably
discharged
that
responsibility.
on
behalf
of
the
court,
thank
you
for
doing
so.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-103
elsevier
versus
muchnick.
