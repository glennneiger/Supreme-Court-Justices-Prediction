mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
statutory
prerequisites
to
suit
like
section
411(a)
often
fall
into
one
of
two
distinct
categories.
they
are
either
jurisdictional
and
therefore
unwaivable
or
they
are
not
jurisdictional
and
are
fully
waivable.
section
411(a)'s
registration
requirement
falls
in
the
middle
of
those
two
extremes.
it
is
not
jurisdictional,
but
it
should
not
be
fully
waivable.
the
provision
does
not
speak
to
the
power
of
the
courts
to
decide
cases
and
therefore
it
does
not
limit
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
infringement
suits.
but,
because
of
this
phrase
and
mandatory
language,
the
requirement
should
be
strictly
enforced
whenever
the
defendant
asserts
it,
and
because
the
requirement
serves
important
public
interest
that
are
independent
of
the
concerns
of
the
parties
to
any
individual
suit--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that,
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
district
court
should
--
when
--
when
the
defendant
waives
the
requirement,
which
would
be
the
rare
case,
when
the
defendant
doesn't
assert
it.
when
the
defendant
waives
the
requirement,
the
district
court
should
consider
whether
accepting
that
waiver
would
undermine
the
public
interest
behind
411.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
it
may
not
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
consider
those
interests
and
decide
that
here
it
would
have
been
acceptable
to
accept
the
defendant's
waiver
and
permit
the
resolution
to
go
forward
because,
in
this
case,
the
periodicals
that
--
that
are
involved
--
the
works
at
issue
were
primarily
already
in
the
possession
of
the
library
of
congress,
because
they
had
been
registered
as
--
the
periodicals
themselves
had
been
registered.
so
the
library's
interest
is
not
as
strongly
implicated
here.
in
addition,
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
going
to
be
settlement,
so
the
court
wasn't
going
to
need
to
adjudicate
the
copyright
claims
and
therefore
the
opportunity
for
the
register's
views
to
be
taken
into
account
was
less
important.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
yes,
we
are
representing
the
interest
of
the
library
of
congress.
so
i
think
in
this
case
it
may
have
been
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
--
that
it
could
let
someone
go
forward,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
some
unregistered
copyrights
were
involved.
but
after
adjudication
on
the
merits,
the
defendant
has
waived
the
requirement,
and,
having
come
up,
section
411(a),
like
any
other
non-jurisdictional
rule,
should
be
subject
to
the
general
principle
that
issues
that
are
not
raised
below
should
not
be
considered
for
the
first
time
on
appeal,
absent
extraordinary
circumstances.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
believe
this
court
has
recognized
that
waiver
doctrines
in
general
are
discretionary,
and
so,
particularly
in
the
area
of
res
judicata,
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
plaut
v.
spendthrift
farm
and
arizona
v.
california
that
the
court
has
some
discretion
to
enforce
res
judicata
on
its
own
motion.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
correct.
i
think
also
the
plain
error
rule
presupposes
that
there
are
some
errors
that
the
district
court
has
a
responsibility
to
correct
on
its
own,
even
though
neither
party
has
brought
the
error
to
its
attention.
so
in
other
words,
the
district
court
has
the
obligation
to
issue
a
legal
ruling
that
neither
party
has
asked
for,
and
i
think
that
kind
of
regime
is
appropriate
here
because
the
public
interest
at
issue,
the
library's
interest
and
the
interest
in
the
public
record
of
copyright,
those
don't
depend
on
the
defendant's
litigation
decisions
--
they
shouldn't
depend
on
the
defendant's
particular
strategic
decisions
within
a
particular
case.
the
library's
interest
will
always
be
in
having
every
work
registered
and
the
public
interest
and
public
record
will
be
the
same.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
it
is
fairly
within
the
question
of
whether
the
rule
is
jurisdictional
or
not,
i
think,
is
--
also
encompasses
the
question
of
how
the
rule
should
be
enforced,
assuming
that
it
is
non-jurisdictional,
of
what
should
happen
in
this
case.
so
i
do
think
that
the
--
the
characterization
of
this
rule
as
a
mandatory
or
a
waivable
rule
is
--
is
within
the
question
presented.
so
i
think
that
the
regime
we're
proposing
best
gives
effect
to
the
mandatory,
but
non-jurisdictional
language
that
congress
used
in
section
411(a).
and
it
also
protects
the
public
interest
that
the
requirement
serves,
which,
again,
the
compilation
of
a
public
record
of
copyrighted
works
in
the
copyright
office,
which
allows
a
robust
licensing
system
under
the
copyright
act.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
don't
think
you
have
to
get
into
it,
justice
scalia.
i
think--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
that
may
be
the
case,
but
i
think
we
are
simply
trying
to
--
trying
to
explain
to
the
court
what
we
think
how
the
rule
should
be
applied
in
the
district
court,
in
the
--
in
the
ordinary
case,
and
then,
in
the
rare
case,
this
one,
where
the
defendant
has
waived,
and
permitting
the
settlement
to
go
forward,
it
wouldn't
adversely
affect
the
public
interest
that
are
normally
in
force
here.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
that
the
--
that
in
general,
the
requirement
would
be
considered
waived
if
it's
not
raised
before
judgment.
we
can't
think
of
a
case
in
which
the
extraordinary
circumstance
would
be
fulfilled.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
no,
i'm
sorry.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
i
don't
think
this
rule
could
ever
be
enforced,
in
the
first
instance,
on
appeal
if
it
has
been
waived
below.
i
think
the
general
civil
rule
for
non-jurisdictional
requirements
is
that
if
it's
not
raised
before
judgment,
it's
lost
on
appeal
--
circumstances--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
that's
the
rule
--
that's
the
rule
that
this
court
has
applied
to
constitutional
rights
with
the
plain
error
rule,
and
also,
with
respect
to
structural
constitutional
rights
that
might
implicate
other
public
interests,
the
general
rule
is
that
if
the
requirement
has
not
been
raised
during
the
--
during
the
trial
stages
of
the
case,
then
it
can't
be
enforced
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
unless
it's
plain
error,
and
in
this
situation,
if
the
plain
error
standard
applied,
or
something
even
more
--
even
more
heightened
in
the
civil
context,
we
can't
think
of
a
case
in
which
registration
requirements--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
those
--
those
circumstances
would
be
true
in
most
cases
in
which
the
--
for
some
reason,
the
requirement
hadn't
been
reached
at
the
trial
stage.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
extraordinary
circumstance
is
present
here
that
would
justify
overturning
the
independent
interest
in
judgment
that
our
legal
system
has,
the
finality
of
judgment,
the
rights
of
the
parties
in
relying
on
that
judgment
and
the
judicial
resources
expended.
you
know,
i
think
in
some
ways
we
can
think
of
this
requirement
as
sort
of
like
a
filing
fee,
that
it's
--
it
serves
interests
beyond
those
of
the
parties
at
the
district
court,
and
therefore
you
wouldn't
think
of
it
as
waivable
at
the
instance
of
the
defendant.
but--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
it's
similar
to
a
lot
of
language
that's
used
in
statutes
of
limitations,
which
are
traditionally
considered
non-jurisdictional,
that
no
statute
--
no
suit
shall
be
instituted.
i
think
what's
important
is
that
it
speaks
in
terms
of
the
actions
of
the
parties,
because
the
parties
institute
a
suit,
not
the
court.
so
it
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
the
power
of
the
court.
and
there's
no
evidence,
i
don't
think,
that
congress
intended
to
withdraw
the
broad
grant
to
jurisdiction
in
1331
and
1338.
i
think
bowles
and
john
r.
sand
are
cases
in
which
the
court's
own
precedents
had
previously
treated
the
rules
at
issue
as
jurisdictional,
had
accorded
them
jurisdictional
consequences.
so
those
are
cases
in
which
the
court
relied
on
stare
decisis,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
have
any
similar
situation
here.
there's
no--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think,
in
enacting
that,
congress
had
recognized
that
the
incentives
for
registration
should
stay
in
place
in
the
civil
context,
but
that
making
an
exception
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
make
a
difference
in
the
criminal
context.
i
think
congress
still
spoke
of
it
as
a
--
as
a
non-jurisdictional
requirement
in
the
legislative
history,
so
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
indication
that
congress
has
ratified
the
second
circuit's
decision
here.
