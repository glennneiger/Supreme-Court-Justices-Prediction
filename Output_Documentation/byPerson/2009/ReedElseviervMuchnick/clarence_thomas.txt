justice
clarence
thomas
now
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
in
new
york
times
versus
tasini,
we
held
that
several
print
publishers
and
owners
of
online
databases
had
infringed
the
copyrights
of
six
freelance
authors
by
reproducing
the
author's
works,
electronically,
without
for
securing
their
permission.
those
holding
affirmed
the
theory
of
liability
underlying
other
copyright
infringement
lawsuits
then
pending
against
the
publishers
and
database
owners
for
similar
conduct.
following
tasini,
these
other
lawsuits
were
consolidated
into
a
single
case.
the
authors
then
filed
an
amended
class-action
complaint
against
the
publishing
companies
and
database
owners.
the
named
plaintiffs
each
owned
at
least
one
copyright
that
they
had
registered
with
the
copyright
office
in
accordance
with
the
copyright
act.
but
class
also
included
authors
who
had
not
registered
their
copyright
works.
after
years
of
negotiations,
the
parties
reached
a
comprehensive
settlement
agreement
and
moved
to
district
court
to
approve
it.
some
of
the
authors
of
unregistered
works
objected,
arguing
that
settlement
treated
them
unfairly
as
compared
to
authors
of
registered
works.
the
district
court
overruled
these
objections,
certified
a
settlement
class
and
approve
the
settlement
agreement.
the
objecting
authors
appeal
before
oral
argument
to
court
of
appeals
on
its
own
accord
asked
the
parties
to
brief
whether
the
district
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
infringement
claims
involving
unregistered
copyrights.
the
basis
for
the
courts
inquiry
17
usc
4,
section
411
(a)
which
provides
an
relevant
part
that
no
civil
action
for
infringement
of
the
copyright
in
any
united
states,
in
any
united
states
work
shall
be
instituted
until
pre-registration
or
registration
of
the
copyright
claim
has
been
made
in
accordance
with
the
copyright
act.
all
parties
filed
briefs
contending
that
the
district
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
certify
a
class
of
claims
arising
from
the
infringement
of
unregistered
works
and
to
approve
a
settlement
with
respect
to
those
same
claims,
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
vacated
the
order
approving
the
settlement
agreement.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
section
41ll
(a)
is
a
registration
requirement,
is
a
pre-condition
to
filing
a
claim
for
copyright
infringement,
that
does
not
restrict
the
federal
court
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
congress
did
not
clearly
state
that
section
411
(a)
is
registration
requirement
is
jurisdiction
and
nothing
about
the
structure
of
section
411
(a)
or
its
context
including
this
court's
prior
interpretation
of
similar
provisions,
suggests
that
congress
nonetheless
ranked
the
registration
requirement
as
jurisdictional
despite
the
absence
of
clear
jurisdictional
label.
accordingly
the
district
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
certify
the
settlement
class
and
to
approve
the
settlement
agreement
even
though
it
included
claims
arising
from
the
alleged
infringement
of
unregistered
copyright
works.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
breyer
joined.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
