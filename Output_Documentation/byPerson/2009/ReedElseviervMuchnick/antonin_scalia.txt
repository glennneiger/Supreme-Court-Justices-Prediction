justice
antonin
scalia
can
--
can
i
ask
you,
one
of
the
points
made
by
the
amicus
is
that,
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
that
what
--
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
phrasing
it
this
way
was
to
enable
--
enable
the
party
who
had
not
gone
to
the
copyright
office
to
go
after
dismissal
on
jurisdictional
grounds,
and
the
implication
is
that
if
it
were
not
held
to
be
jurisdictional,
there
would
be
a
merits
dismissal
because
of
the
failure
to
have
gone
to
the
copyright
office
first.
and
therefore
would
not
--
the
plaintiff
would
not
be
able
to
come
back
to
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
think
it
related
to
the
third
sentence.
i
--
i
thought
she
said
the
whole
purpose
of
congress
was
to
make
sure
that
you'd
be
able
to
come
back,
that
your
failure
to
go
to
the
copyright
office
initially
would
not
result
in
a
merits
dismissal
so
that
you
could
not
later
go
back
and
then
rebring
the
suit.
if
it
was
jurisdictional,
just
a
jurisdictional
dismissal,
the
jurisdiction
could
be
cured
by
going
to
the
copyright
office
and
your
suit
could
then
proceed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you'd
be
able
to
come
back
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
you'd
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
shouldn't
use
loose
language,
especially
when
it's
the
same
loose
language,
supposedly,
that
seems
to
have
been
used
by
all
the
courts
of
appeals
and
all
the
district
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
years
and
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
how
--
how
would
we
get
to
hold
what
--
what
you
say
is
the
law?
it
seems,
to
me,
once
we
decide
it's
not
jurisdictional
and
once
we
agree
with
you,
that
it
doesn't
--
at
least
in
this
case
--
didn't
have
to
be
raised
sua
sponte
by
the
district
court.
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
and
so
why
do
we
have
to
engage
in
the
further
discussion,
well,
ordinarily,
the
district
court
must
raise
it
on
its
own
and
--
you
know,
and,
if
it
doesn't
ordinarily
--
you
know,
the
appellate
court
should.
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
we
shouldn't.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
normal,
but
not
invariable.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it
is
plain
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
pretty
plain
that
the
things
haven't
been
registered.
i
mean,
right?
and
it's
pretty
plain
that
if
they
hadn't
been
registered,
the
district
court
should
not
have
proceeded
with
the
case.
so
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
normally
be
plain
error
in
--
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
"until".
that's
a
limitation
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
until
preregistration
or
registration
has
been
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
our
limitation
period.
