justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
a
sort
of
basic
question
i
never
understood
about
this
case.
as
i
understand
it,
the
end-of-the-line
concern
of
the
fairness
of
the
settlement,
and
particularly
to
people
who
have
copyrights
who
have
never
been
registered.
am
i
right,
that
that's
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
those
were
people
who
owned
some
registered
copyrights,
but
had
other
works
that
were
not
--
had
no
registered
copyrights.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
there
any
of
those
people
who
had
no
--
no
copyrights
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
had
some
registered
works?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
risks
involved
here
is
whether
people
who
had
no
registered
works
are
being
adequately
protected
by
this
class
c
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
just
to
get
the
question
on
the
table
--
i
don't
want
to
take
up
much
of
your
time.
i
don't
understand
how
it
makes
any
difference
whether
you
say
the
rule
is
mandatory
or
the
rule
is
jurisdictional,
in
terms
of
the
fairness
of
the
settlement,
at
the
end
of
the
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
--
i
just
hate
to
reveal
my
ignorance
on
something
like
this,
but
i
had
the
same
problem
with
your
opponent.
i
really
don't
understand
why
it
makes
any
difference
whether
you
call
a
requirement
mandatory
or
you
call
it
jurisdictional
in
terms
of
the
fairness
of
settlement,
all
the
considerations
you
are
discussing.
it
seems
to
me
as
a
practical
matter
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
not
make
all
the
arguments
directed
at
the
fairness
of
the
settlements
and
so
forth
if
it
were
merely
mandatory?
