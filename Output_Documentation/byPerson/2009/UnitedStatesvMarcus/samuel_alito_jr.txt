justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this?
prong
three
of
--
of
olano
looks
to
prejudice,
right?
and
then
it's
your
position
that
prong
four
also
looks
to
prejudice?
where
you
have
two
prejudice
inquiries,
one
is
more
searching
than
the
other,
perhaps?
how
do
they
fit
together
in
that
relation
--
in
that
regard?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
under
--
under
three,
the
court
could
conclude
that
the
defendant
has
shown
that
it
isn't
clear
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
for
a
constitutional
error,
that
the
error
didn't
affect
the
outcome,
so
the
defendant
would
clear
prong
three,
but
in
prong
four,
a
defendant
might
still
lose
if
it's
fairly
clear,
but
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
--
is
that
--
that
how
it
would
work?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
if
the
--
what
if
the
period
--
the
--
the
period
that
was
charged
started
1
day
before
the
statute
took
effect?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
--
would
the
test
be
different?
now,
if
you
have
1
day
of
pre-enactment
conduct,
it's
possible
that
the
jury
could
convict
based
on
that
--
the
evidence
relating
to
that
1
day,
isn't
it?
and
so,
therefore,
if
the
test
is
any
possibility,
the
result
is
automatic
new
trial
in
that
situation.
is
--
is
that
where
your
argument
leads?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
the
conduct
that
--
we
didn't
have
--
what
if
we
did
not
have
pre-enactment
conduct?
what
if
we
--
if
this
statute
applies
only
within
the
united
states,
as
i
assume
that
it
does,
and
all
of
the
conduct
that's
now
pre-enactment
was
conduct
that
took
place
outside
the
united
states?
would
that
--
would
the
case
be
different
for
these
purposes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
instead
of
having
pre-enactment
conduct,
you
have
conduct
in
canada,
mexico,
someplace
else.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
of
course,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
mere
possibility
standard
would
apply
in
that
case
as
well,
or
whether
you
think
this
mere
possibility
standard
applies
only
in
the
case
of
pre-enactment
conduct?
