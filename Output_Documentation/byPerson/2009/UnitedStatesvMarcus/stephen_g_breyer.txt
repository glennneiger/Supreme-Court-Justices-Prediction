justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
assume
you
could
make
all
that
argument
on
remand,
if
we
remand
it.
but
what's
your
argument
--
apparently
from
what
i've
read
in
this
case,
the
second
circuit
uses
a
standard
of
plain
error
that
nobody
else
uses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
says
that
all
the
other
circuits
say:
this
is
our
set
of
standards,
and
we've
set
them
forth.
and
the
second
circuit
says:
no,
it's
--
you
have
to
have
a
new
trial
if
there's
any
possibility,
no
matter
how
unlikely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
nobody
else
uses
that.
it
seems
contrary
to
our
cases,
and
is
there
any
justification
for
their
using
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
unless
i
can
hear
a
justification,
i
would
guess
i
would
vote
to
say
send
it
back
and
let
them
use
the
same
standard
anybody
else
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
don't
you
make
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
very
magnitude
of
the
error
would
argue
for
--
you'd
win
on
any
test.
i
mean,
why
does
that
say
you
have
to
use
a
special
test
that
is
specially
designed
to
find
when
there
is
hardly
any
error?
here
there's
such
a
bigger
error,
according
--
that
you
think
that
you
would
have
won
under
any
test.
so
that
--
so
why
--
why
do
you
do
have
to
have
this
special
favorable
test?
that's
--
that's
the
question
that
i'm
thinking
of.
i'm
not
thinking
of
whether
you
are
right
or
whether
you
are
wrong
on
the
--
how
much
evidence
there
was
and
how
awful
it
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
and
also
no
person
should
be
convicted
with
a
confession
that
was
coerced.
and
no
person
should
be
convicted
with
evidence
given
under
torture.
and
no
person
should
be
convicted
with
evidence
unlawfully
seized
by
the
police.
now,
for
all
those
latter
things,
every
court
apparently
uses
the
normal
standard.
so
why
would
we
in
this
case
use
a
special
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
jury
convicted
the
respondent
glenn
marcus
of
sex
trafficking
crimes
that
took
place
between
“january
1999
and
october
2001”.
on
appeal,
for
the
first
time
on
appeal,
marcus
pointed
out
that
the
relevant
statute
that
he
was
convicted
under,
had
not
become
enactive,
wasn't
enacted
into
law
into
well
in
between
this
period
of
time
in
october
2000.
he
said
the
jury
might
have
based
its
conviction
on
events
that
took
place
before
the
statute
became
law
and
that
the
constitution
consequently
required
a
new
trial.
now
everyone
agrees
in
this
case
that
the
constitution
would
forbid
the
jury
to
convict
marcus
solely
on
the
basis
of
conduct
that
was
not
unlawful
at
that
time
because
the
statute
hadn’t
passed
and
that
a
failure
to
give
the
jury
an
appropriate
instruction
that
would've
made
sure,
they
knew
that,
was
a
mistake,
an
error
and
for
present
purposes,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
error
was
clear
enough
in
this
case
that
it
might
qualify
as
a
“plain
error"
which
is
the
kind
of
error,
court
of
appeals
can
take
into
account
even
if
the
defendant
doesn't
raise
the
matter
of
trial.
but
still
they
will
take
this
into
account
as
a
“plain
error”
only
if
among
other
things,
it
affects
the
defendant
substantial
rights
and
here
the
government
argued
there's
so
little
chance
that
the
jury
would
really
have
in
this
case
based
its
conviction
solely
on
the
basis
of
conduct
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
court
should
just
ignore
this
mistake.
now
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
government’s
argument,
but
not
because
it
thought
the
error,
probably
made
a
difference
in
the
case.
it
didn't
decide,
whether
the
error
did
or
did
not
make
a
difference
in
the
case,
rather
it
rejected
the
error
because
in
its
view
and
here
i
quote
the
standard
that
it
put
down,
“a
retrial
is
necessary
whenever
there
is
any
possibility,
no
matter
how
unlikely,
that
the
jury
could
have
convicted
based
exclusively
on
pre-enactment
conduct.”
now
no
other
circuit
has
followed
that
kind
of
rule
and
in
this
case,
we
hold
that
the
second
circuit
standard
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
holding
setting
forth
the
requirements
about
when
courts
can
recognize
and
when
they
can't
recognize
a
“plain
error”.
the
requirements
which
stem
from
the
rules
require
a
greater
likelihood.
then
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
error
really
did
make
a
difference.
the
words,
any
possibility,
no
matter
how
unlikely,
suggested
it
needn't
have
made
any
difference
at
all
but
the
law
requires
it
to
have
made
a
difference,
so
we
remand
the
case
so
that
it
considered,
it
can
reconsider
it
applying
the
correct
“plain
error”
standard.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
