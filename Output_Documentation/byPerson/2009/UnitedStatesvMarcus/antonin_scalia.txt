justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
us
to
do
it,
right?
you
want
us
to
remand
it
so
that
they
can
do
it,
right?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well
--
well,
but
the
same
constitutional
analysis
includes
step
four,
which
is
whether
it
undermines
confidence
in
the
result.
and
don't
you
think
that
some
constitutional
violations
more
undermine
confidence
than
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
if
the
instruction
told
the
jury
in
a
criminal
case
that
you
can
find
the
defendant
guilty
if
you
think
it
more
likely
than
not
that
he
committed
the
crime,
that
might
be
different,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
address
the
test
used
by
the
second
circuit.
that's
what
we're
concerned
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
the
question
pertained
to.
they're
using
a
test
nobody
else
used,
that
does
not
comport
with
--
with
our
prior
opinions.
why
shouldn't
we
send
it
back
and
tell
them,
you
know,
use
the
right
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
call
it
an
ex
post
facto
violation,
but
i
--
i
--
i
rather
agree
with
the
government;
it's
a
due
process
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
happened
is
improper
evidence
was
admitted,
because
it
concerned
pre
--
pre-statute
conduct.
but
it
might
have
been
evidence
that
was
--
that
was
irrelevant
for
some
other
reason.
that
would
be
just
as
much
of
a
--
a
due
process
violation.
what
is
special
about
the
fact
that
the
reason
the
evidence
before
the
jury
was
incorrect
was
that
it
--
the
conduct
occurred
before
the
--
before
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
when
a
state
court
allows
pre-law
conduct
to
uphold
a
conviction,
that
is
an
ex
post
facto
violation,
and
we
would
reverse
the
state
court
judgment.
but
that's
not
what
occurred
here.
what
occurred
here
is
that
the
trial
court
let
the
jury
consider
evidence,
as
evidence
bearing
upon
conviction,
which
it
should
not
have
let
the
jury
consider.
and
there's
a
lot
of
evidence
that
a
court
should
not
have
let
the
jury
consider.
i
don't
see
anything
particularly
special
about
fact
that
the
reason
this
evidence
shouldn't
have
been
before
the
jury
was
that
it
occurred
before
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and,
therefore,
no
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
also
no
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
which
is
in
article
i
of
the
constitution
and
which
says
no
ex
post
facto
law
shall
be
passed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
--
you
don't
have
an
ex
post
facto
law
that
was
passed
here.
you
have
an
incorrect
jury
charge.
you
have
the
judge
telling
the
jury
that
you
could
convict
on
the
basis
of
this
prior
conduct
when,
in
fact,
you
couldn't.
that
is
not
an
ex
post
facto
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
looking
for
marks,
where
is
that
in
--
is
that
in
your
brief
somewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
mentioned
several
times
the
marks
case.
what
case
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
see,
i
don't
know
what
that
case
is.
if
it
was
a
case
in
which
we
reversed
a
state
supreme
court
because
the
state
supreme
court
upheld
the
state
statute
that
--
you
know,
that
made
prior
conduct
unlawful,
then
i
--
i
think
i
could
say
that
was
an
ex
post
facto
violation
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
this
--
this
evidence
was
improper
because
if
the
legislature
had
made
that
action
punishable
when
it
occurred
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
now,
in
fact,
the
legislature
didn't
do
that,
and,
therefore,
we
have
no
real
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
but
we
do
have
the
admission
of
evidence
that
shouldn't
have
been
admitted,
which
is
no
different
from
evidence
that
should
have
not
been
admitted
for
some
other
reason.
for
example,
where
the
--
where
the
court
gives
an
instruction
that
permits
evidence
to
be
considered
as
evidence
of
the
crime
which,
in
fact,
is
irrelevant
to
the
crime.
and
the
jury
says
you
can
find
him
guilty
if
you
find
that
he
held
two
fingers
up
in
the
air,
when,
in
fact,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime.
why
is
this
any
different
from
that?
it's
just
evidence
that
the
jury
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
use
for
conviction.
i
don't
see
why
there
is
anything
special
about
the
fact
that
the
reason
it
shouldn't
be
used
for
conviction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
because
it
occurred
pre-statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
courtesy
--
courtesy
of
justice
kennedy,
i
have
--
i
have
before
me
the
marks
case.
and
the
--
the
summary
of
the
case
at
the
beginning
says:
"petitioners
were
convicted
of
transporting
obscene
materials
in
violation
of
the
federal
statute.
"
"held:
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
precludes
retroactive
application
to
petitioners
of
the
miller
standards.
"
it
was
a
due
process
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
the
due
process
clause
was
violated
when
the
court
let
that
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
--
you
have
to
persuade
us
that
there
is
something
special
about
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
that
lets
in
evidence
which
is
pre-statute,
as
opposed
to
violations
that
let
in
other
evidence
that
should
not
properly
be
used
to
convict
the
defendant.
and
i
frankly
don't
--
don't
see
why
it's
so
special.
