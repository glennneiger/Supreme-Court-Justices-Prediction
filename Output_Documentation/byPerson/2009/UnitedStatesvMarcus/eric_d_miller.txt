mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
reversal
of
respondent's
conviction
was
appropriate
on
plain
error
review
if
there
was
any
possibility,
no
matter
how
unlikely,
that
the
jury's
verdict
was
based
entirely
on
conduct
predating
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
under
rule
52(b),
a
defendant
asserting
a
forfeited
claim
of
error
may
prevail
only
by
showing
at
a
minimum
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
error
actually
affected
the
outcome
of
the
case.
in
particular,
the
fourth
prong
of
the
olano
plain
error
test
requires
a
defendant
to
show
a
serious
effect
on
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
that
test
calls
for
a
case-specific,
fact-intensive
inquiry,
and
the
defendant
cannot
satisfy
it
if
there
is
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
error
affected
the
outcome.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
cases
applying
prong
four
of
the
plain
error
test,
johnson,
cotton,
and
most
recently
puckett
from
just
last
term.
puckett
established
that
the
prong
four
inquiry
is
case-specific
and
fact-intensive
and
that
a
per
se
rule
at
prong
four
is
inappropriate.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
here,
applying
a
per
se
rule
that
if
there's
any
possibility
of
prejudice,
reversal
is
required.
in
addition,
johnson
and
cotton
made
clear
that
when
the
error
is
one
that
affects
an
issue
on
which
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
or
essentially
uncontroverted,
the
defendant
has
not
shown
a
serious
effect
on
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings,
and,
indeed,
reversal
in
that
context
on
the
basis
of
a
forfeited
error
that
didn't
affect
the
outcome
would
undermine
public
confidence
in
the
judicial
system.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
this
court
has
reserved
the
question
of
whether,
for
example,
a
structural
error
would
automatically
satisfy
the
"affects
substantial
rights"
component
of
the
--
of
prong
three
of
the
olano
test.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
the
sort
of
error
that,
if
properly
preserved,
would
result
in
automatic
reversal
without
an
assessment
of
harmlessness.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
mean
in
johnson,
for
example,
the
court
had
not
yet
decided
neder,
and
so
in
johnson
it
was
unclear
whether
the
omission
of
one
element,
the
failure
to
instruct
the
jury
on
one
element
of
the
offense,
was
a
structural
error.
and
in
johnson,
the
court
said,
even
assuming
that
that's
a
structural
error
and
even
assuming
that,
therefore,
the
defendant
has
satisfied
prong
three,
showing
an
effect
on
the
substantial
rights,
nonetheless
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
apply
prong
four
and
has
to
evaluate
on
the
basis
of
the
record
and
the
facts
in
that
particular
case
whether
there
was
an
effect
on
the
fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
there
wasn't,
because
the
evidence
on
the
point
that
was
the
subject
of
the
instructional
error
was
overwhelming,
and
essentially
uncontroverted.
and
that's,
in
our
view,
the
sort
of
analysis,
the
sort
of
case-specific
assessment
of
the
facts
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
undertaken
in
this
case.
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
essentially
to
carve
out
a
special
rule
of
plain
error
review
that's
applicable
only
to
a
particular
kind
of
error;
namely--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
that's
--
that's
right.
we
think
that
prong
three
in
the
case
of
a
constitutional
error
requires
at
least
a
reasonable
possibility
of
prejudice,
and
prong
four
i
think
demands
at
least
that
much
and,
in
some
cases,
may
demand
more.
one
example
of
a
case
where
a
defendant
could
satisfy
prong
three
but
not
prong
four
would
be,
for
example,
a
melendez-diaz
kind
of
error.
if
you
had
a
drug
possession
case
where
the
only
evidence
that
the
substance
the
defendant
possessed
was
cocaine
was
a
laboratory
certificate
admitted
without
confrontation,
that
would
be
a
plain
error
under
melendez-diaz,
and
that
would
--
the
defendant
would
be
able
to
show
an
effect
on
his
substantial
rights,
because
if
that
was
the
only
piece
of
evidence,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict
without
it.
nonetheless--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--under
prong
three.
but
looking
at
prong
four,
the
court
would
say
--
i
mean,
if,
for
example,
the
defendant
had
had
an
opportunity
to
subpoena
the
chemist,
if
he
hadn't
controverted
the
accuracy
of
the
report,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
concluding
on
those
facts
that
there
was
a
serious
effect
on
the
fairness
or
integrity
or
reputation
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
if,
under
three,
the
defendant
fails,
then
you
don't
need
to
apply
prong
four,
because
prong
four
--
prong
four
is
essentially
an
implementation
of
the
discretion
conferred
by
the
word--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--52(b).
in
order
for
the
court
to
have
any
authority
to
correct
a
plain
error,
it
must
be
one
that
affects
substantial
rights.
so--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
is
some
overlap
in
the
inquiries,
but
we
think
that,
you
know,
as
the
court
made
clear
in
puckett,
rule
four
requires
a
fact-intensive,
case-specific
inquiry.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
or
if,
you
know,
as
in
the
--
my
melendez-diaz
example,
or
if
the
nature
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
that,
you
know,
apart
from
the
effect
on
the
defendant's
rights
of
that
particular
error,
that
error,
in
the
context
of
the
case,
doesn't
undermine
public
confidence
in
the
outcome.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
was
to
create
a
special
rule
applicable
only
to
those
errors
involving
the
failure
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
may
not
convict
solely
on
pre-enactment
evidence.
the
court
didn't
give
any
reason
why
those
errors
should
be
treated
differently
from
other
kinds
of
errors.
instead,
it
was
simply
applying
a
line
of
circuit
precedent
that
went
back
to
cases
predating
olano.
and
there
is
no
reason
for
creating
a
special
rule
in
that
context.
to
the
contrary,
johnson
emphatically
rejected
the
proposition
that
there
are
errors
that
are
not
subject
to
rule
52(b)
analysis.
and
the
court
said
that
even
errors
implicating
fundamental
constitutional
rights
like
the
sixth
amendment
--
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
johnson
or
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
a
grand
jury
in
cotton
are
also
subject
to
the
application--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--this
court's
usual
practice
when
there's
an
issue
that
wasn't
passed
upon
below
is
to
leave
it
to
be
considered
on
remand.
we
think
that's
particularly
appropriate
because
of
the
fact
and
record-intensive
nature
of
the
argument
in
this
case.
so,
if
the
court
does
reach
that
issue,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
analysis
of
the
concurring
judges
below,
who
said
that,
with
respect
to
the
forced
labor
conviction,
respondent's
conduct
in
the
pre-enactment
and
post-enactment
periods
were
essentially
identical,
such
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
on
which
a
rational
jury
could
have
concluded
that
he
violated
the
statute
in
the
pre-enactment
period--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--indeed,
it
would.
in
order
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
forced-labor
statute,
the
government
had
to
show
that
respondent
had
obtained
labor
services
by
threats
of
serious
harm
or
by
a
scheme,
pattern,
or
plan
intended
to
cause
the
victim
to
believe
that
she
would
suffer
serious
harm.
and
so,
in
this
case,
there
was
essentially
a
uniform
course
of
conduct
of
the
respondent
obtaining
labor
services,
making
threats
of
harm,
and,
indeed,
brutally
carrying
out
those
threats.
and
so
the
pre-enactment
threats
and
pre-enactment
acts
carrying
out
the
threats
would
certainly
be
relevant
to
show
that
the
post-enactment
threats
were
indeed
genuine
threats
and
that
the
victim
could
take
them
seriously
as
threats,
and
that
they
did
indeed
induce
her
to
provide
the
labor
or
services.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
there
--
i
mean,
the
statute
refers
to
"labor
or
services".
and
creating
a
web
site
is
a
kind
of
labor
or
service,
and
maintaining
a
web
site
is
also
a
kind
of
labor
or
service.
and
there's
--
as
the
concurring
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
there's
no
basis
on
which
the
jury
could
have
concluded
that
one
satisfies
the
statute
but
the
other
does
not.
they're
both
--
they
both
fall
comfortably
within
the
ordinary
meaning--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
in
johnson
the
court
quite
clearly
said
that
even
very
serious
constitutional
errors
are
subject
to
the
same
analysis
under
rule
52(b).
and
certainly
there's--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--absolutely.
and
the
test
that
would
be
applied
would
be
the
same,
but
the
result
of
that
test
might
be
different.
for
example,
if
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
i
mean,
if
the
error
were,
for
example,
a
biased
judge
--
i
mean,
that
would
be
one
that
would
almost
invariably
undermine
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
because
the
error,
the
essential
error
in
this
case,
was
the
failure
to
give
the
jury
an
instruction
telling
them
that
they
could
not
convict
on
the
basis
of
pre-enactment
conduct.
and
that
is
essentially
analogous
to
the
error
that
you
had
in
johnson,
where
there
was
a
failure
to
give
the
jury
an
instruction
telling
them
that
they
had
to
find
materiality.
and
there--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
in
the
context
of
an
error
like
this,
there
isn't
any
reason
to
attach
extra
weight--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
that
very
well
might
be
different.
that's
right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no.
i
mean
--
that's
right.
the
ex
post
facto
clause
regulates
the
content
of
the
laws
that
congress
can
pass,
and
there
would
be
an
ex
post
facto
issue
in
the
case
if
congress
had
tried
to
make
section
1589
retroactive,
but
it
didn't.
and
everyone
agrees
that
section
1589
applies
only
prospectively.
so
the
constitutional
violation,
if
there
is
one,
comes
from
the
possibility
that
the
defendant
could
have
been
convicted
on
the
basis
of
congress
--
of
conduct
that
did
not
violate
the
statute.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
there
is
a
violation
in
the
failure
to
instruct.
and
we
think
it's
the
due
process
clause
that
is
the
source
of
the
requirement
that
the
defendant
not
be
convicted
on
the
basis
of
the
conduct
that
doesn't
violate
a
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
just
very
brief
--
excuse
me
--
very
briefly,
i'd
like
to
make
two
points.
the
first
is
that,
essentially,
the
error
in
this
case
was
the
failure
to
give
a
limiting
instruction
relating
to
the
use
of
pre-enactment
evidence,
and
that's
the
same
sort
of
instructional
or
evidentiary
error
that
can
be
considered
in
a
case-specific
analysis
under
prong
four
and
should
have
been
considered
through
that
analysis.
the
second
is
that
respondent
suggested
there
was
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
that
argument
rests
on
an
understanding
of
jurisdiction
that
this
court
rejected
in
cotton,
and
we
discussed
that
at
pages
9
to
11
of
our
reply
brief.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded.
