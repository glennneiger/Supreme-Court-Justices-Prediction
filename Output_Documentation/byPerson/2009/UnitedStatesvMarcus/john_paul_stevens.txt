mr.
miller,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
we
are
construing
rule
52(b)
here,
not
--
as
construed
in
olano,
which
has
developed
the
four
factors.
in
your
view,
does
the
character
of
the
violation,
in
this
case
an
ex
post
facto
violation,
does
that
ever
make
a
difference?
could
a
court
ever
think
that
one
kind
of
constitutional
violation
is
a
little
bit
more
serious
than
another,
or
are
they
all
fungible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
not
also
be
possible
that
some
constitutional
violations
undermine
confidence
a
little
more
than
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
is
the
second
circuit
so
wrong
to
say:
we
think
ex
post
facto
violations
are
perhaps
a
little
more
serious
than
some
others.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
all
omissions
in
jury
instructions
fungible,
then?
i'm
--
here
we
have
an
omission
in
a
jury
instruction
relating
to
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
does
--
the
fact
that
it
relates
to
the
ex
post
facto
clause
doesn't
give
it
any
extra
weight
or
any
lesser
weight
in
the
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
--
may
i
ask
this
question
about
the
--
i
--
i
should
know
this,
but
i
don't.
to
what
extent
has
the
regular
test
that
my
colleagues
referred
to
applied
in
ex
post
facto
cases
in
other
circuits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
those
ex
post--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--ex
post
facto
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
isn't
necessarily
a
conflict
between
this
case
and
all
other
plain
error
cases;
it's
a
narrow
category
of
cases
involving
ex
post
facto
violations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
not
only
allowed
the
evidence
before
the
jury,
but
it
also
told
the
jury
it
was
sufficient
to
convict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
he
could
be
convicted
on
the
basis
of
what
had
happened
in
canada.
that
would
be
the
same?
