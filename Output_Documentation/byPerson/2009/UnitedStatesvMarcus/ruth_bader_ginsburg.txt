are
there
errors
that
are
--
that
are
so
basic
that
they
would
call
for
an
automatic
new
trial?
you
say
this
--
this
is
not
such
a
--
such
an
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
mean
by
"structural"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
if
you
can
be
concrete,
other
than
a
reasonable
doubt
charge,
what
else
would
be
structural?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
was
made
that
in
the
pre-enactment
period
the
web
site
was
created,
and
that's
when
the
--
that
was
the
really
hard
labor,
as
compared
to
just
keeping
it
up
to
date?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
convicted,
but
not
--
there
was
a
possibility,
but
not
a
reasonable
possibility.
that
is,
it's
conceivable,
but
the
government
also
is
urging
the
reasonable
possibility
that
it
is
not
likely,
given
the
character
of
the
evidence
in
the
post-enactment
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
kennedy
suggested
that,
even
though
the
conduct
was
pre-enactment,
it
would
have
come
in
to
show
pattern,
scheme.
so
it's
one
--
one
thing
is
to
say
the
evidence,
the
jury
would
not
have
seen
that
evidence,
would
not
have
heard
the
evidence,
and
another
to
say
the
judge
should
have
charged
them:
now,
you
cannot
use
this
evidence
that
you've
heard
for
another
purpose.
you
cannot
use
it
to
determine
his
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
position
that
two
concurring
judges
said
that
evidence
should
not
have
been
--
not
that
it
shouldn't
have
come
in,
but
the
jury
should
have
been
told
you
can
convict
only
on
post
--
whatever
the
date
was?
but
they
also
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
most
severe
incidents
fell
in
the
post-enactment
period.
it
was
in
april
of
2001.
it
was
--
and
that
was
vivid
evidence
properly
--
properly
used
by
the
jury
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
position
is,
essentially,
plain
error
doesn't
apply
in
this
area;
it's
just
error
because
it
involved
evidence
pre-enactment?
that
error
is
enough;
it
doesn't
have
to
meet--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
doesn't
have
to
meet
the
standard
for
plain
error?
