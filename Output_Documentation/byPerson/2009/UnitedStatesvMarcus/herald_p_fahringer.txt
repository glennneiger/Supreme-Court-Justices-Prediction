mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
we
do
believe
there
are
errors
that
are
so
basic
that
they
require
a
reversal
automatically.
and
certainly
one
of
them
is
trying
a
person
for
conduct
for
2
years
that
violated
no
law.
it's
almost
unimaginable
and
it's
unheard
of.
there
are
very
few
cases
that
even
come
close
to
resembling--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--that's--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--what's
so
important
about
that,
if
it
please
your
honor,
is
that
he
couldn't
have
been
convicted
on
that
evidence.
the
court
would
have
instructed
that
this
evidence
was
received--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--but
here,
your
honor,
all
this
evidence
came
in,
and
he
could
be
convicted
and
was
convicted
on
the
--
what
we
lend
--
we
think
lends
an
awful
lot
of
force
to
our
argument
here
is
that
the
government
has
conceded
that
he
could
have
been
convicted
exclusively
on
the
pre-enactment
conduct
alone.
that
that
was--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well,
your
honor,
i
understand
that,
but
i
certainly
--
i'd
like
to
say
first,
in
terms
of
the
concession
that
was
made
here,
you
are
talking
about
2
years
of
conduct
that
came
into
a
trial
that
is
really
quite
extraordinary
and
terribly
dynamic.
the
one
--
last
third
of
that,
your
honor,
i
think
cannot
--
even
though
it
came
post-statute,
it
cannot
be
used
to
legitimatize
that
first
2
years.
and
--
and
the
jury
heard
all
of
it,
and
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
we
attach
a
great
deal
of
importance
to,
the
last
question
the
jury
asked
of
the
judge:
we
want
to
know
what
constitutes
labor.
and
they
put
in
their
note
the
--
the
largest
task
of
all,
the
building
and
the
designing
of
the
web
site
and
then
maintaining
it.
and
that
was
all
pre-enactment;
the
threats
were
all
pre-enactment.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
it
was
out
for
7
days,
your
honor.
seven
days
the
jury
deliberated
over
this
case.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
but
--
but,
your
honor,
i
wanted
to
mention
to
the
court,
of
course,
rule
403
that
says
that
if
the
prejudice
of
the
evidence
outweighs
the
probative
value.
i
think
if
we
could
take
ourselves
back
to
that
trial
court
and
a
lawyer
stood
up
and
said,
your
honor,
we
want
to
put
in
2
years
of
background
evidence,
i
--
i
think
there's
a
good
likelihood
that
it
would
have
been
excluded.
i
don't
think
you
can
say--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--sorry
to
hear
that,
your
honor.
but
in
the
--
in
the
course
of
taking
in
some
evidence
as
background,
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
of
this
magnitude
in
a
unique
case
where
the
evidence
that's
coming
in
bears
directly
on
the
liability.
and
i
think
the
--
the
question
is
terribly
important
because,
obviously,
it
shows
the
jury
was
focused
on
the
pre-enactment
conduct,
even
with
the
forced
labor.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--yes.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well,
one
point
you
make,
your
honor,
that
i--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--it's
certainly
welcome,
and
that
is
that
we
are
seeking
a
retrial
here.
you
know,
you
speak
in
just
genuine
fairness
that
--
that
the
gentleman
can
be
tried
on
that
conduct
that
was
post-enactment.
but
in
response
to
your
honor's
question,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
--
the
--
the
difficulty
is,
in
this
whole
case
is,
it
all
ran
together
in
front
of
the
jury,
and
they
saw
all
of
this
proof
with
no
instruction,
with
no
demarcation,
and
--
and
the
--
the
mere
weight,
the
volume
of
the
2
years
out
in
front
of
that
had
to
have
a--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
your
honor,
i
think
--
and
i
choose
my
words
carefully
--
i
think
that
this
test
under
this
circumstance
was
justified.
when
the
court
saw
the
magnitude
of
the
error
here,
they
had
to
say
if
there
was
any
possibility
that
the
jury
relied
exclusively--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
think
--
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
which
is
a
--
an
incisive
one,
and
that
is
because,
your
honor,
it's
only
--
the
court
made
it
very
clear,
we're
only
applying
this
test
to
ex
post
facto,
and
i
think
in
this
instance
you
are
right,
the
magnitude
of
the
error
prompted
them
to
say
that
if
there
was
any
possibility
that
this
2
years
of
conduct
--
the
jury
could
have
based
their
verdict
exclusively
on
that,
we
think
we
had
to
be
granted
a
new
trial.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
the
--
the
olano
test,
your
honor?
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well,
the
possibility
test
has
been
used
in
the
third
circuit
in
the
tykarsky
case.
it
has
also
been
used
in
several
states--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--georgia
being
one.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--in
the
--
in
this
very
narrow
category,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--your
honor,
as
i
know,
you
are
aware
of
the
marks
case.
they
held
that
the
ex
post
facto
concept
applied
to
judicial
precedent
as
well,
and
that
was
repeated
in
the
harris
case
in
--
as
well.
but
i
think,
your
honor,
certainly
the
whole
strength
and
--
and
weight
of
the
ex
post
facto
law
is
present
here.
the
second
circuit
said
that
it
certainly
involves
ex
post
facto
implications.
what
you
are
doing
is,
you're
taking
conduct
that
violates
no
law
before
the
law
is
passed,
and
you're
taking--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--your
honor,
that's
right.
it
--
it
--
what
is
special
about
it
is
--
i
think
it's
an
extremely
rare
and
irregular
case
that
would
allow
2
years
of
conduct
to
come
into
a
case--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well,
if
it
was
--
your
honor,
my
stand--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--my
argument
is,
your
honor,
that
no
person
in
this
country
under
our
constitution
should
be
tried
for
1
day
on
conduct
that
did
not
violate
a
law.
i
--
i--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well,
it's
different,
your
honor.
in
all
of
those
cases,
there
was
a
law,
at
least
giving
the
court
jurisdiction,
that
was
violated.
there's
a
very
serious
question
here
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
when
they
came
in.
jurisdiction
is
derived
solely
through
statutes
that
are
violated
in
the
criminal
field.
there
were
no
statutes.
so
there's
a
serious
question
of
whether
there
was
even
jurisdiction.
but
--
but
what's
different
is
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
a
law,
a
mail
fraud
law,
and
then
there
is
some
sort
of
a
violation
and
a
--
a
suppression
of
evidence
or
whatever
other
arguments
you're
going
to
make,
that's
--
that's
light
years
away
from
a
situation
where
there's
absolutely
no
law
to
--
to
violate.
and
the
conduct--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
but,
your
honor--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--but,
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
in
all
due
respect,
i
invite
your
attention
to
your
case
in
marks
and
--
and
the
harris
case
where
they
have
said
that
we
have
extended
ex
post
facto
to
obviously
a
--
a
whole
host
of
cases
now
that
involve
judicial
precedent
and
--
and
the
actions
of
prosecutors
and
what
not.
this,
i
can't
imagine
in
a
way
in
terms
of
the
concept
of
ex
post
facto
to
put
in
2
years
of
conduct
that
is
not
in
violation
of
any
law,
that
certainly
fits
within
the
presiding
spirit
of
the
ex
post
facto
concept
that
people
shouldn't
--
you
know,
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
our
very
basics,
and
that's
what
unique
about
this
case,
the
entitlement
to
notice
of
what
conduct
is
to
be
avoided,
a
statute
that
tells
you
what
conduct
you
have
to
avoid,
and
all
those--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
m-a-r-k-s.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
that's
in
--
in
our--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
--
i
believe
it
was
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
i
will
give
you
that
in
just
a
moment,
if
i
may.
but
--
but
i'm
under
the
impression,
your
honor,
from
our
research
that
there
were
a
number
of
cases--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
think
this
comment
is
relevant
to
what
you
just
said.
our
forefathers
in
--
in
imposing
an
ex
post
facto
clause
--
it's
one
of
the
few
that
they
imposed
on
the
states
as
well
as
the
federal
government,
and
i
think
that
lends
it
force
in
a
sense
that
the
states
have
an
ex
post
facto
clause
as
does
the
federal
government.
but
we
feel,
under
all
those
circumstances
here,
what
--
all
roads
lead
back
to
one
very,
very
critical
fact,
and
that
is
the
enormity
of
the
error
here
at
being
a
--
a
constitutional
error,
and
we
certainly
think
a
structural
error,
structural
error
in
the
sense
that
it
ran
from
the
beginning
of
the
case.
the
grand
jury
should
not
have
indicted
on
conduct
that
violated
no
law.
he
should
not
have
been
arraigned.
he
should
not
have
been
tried.
he
should
not
have
convicted.
he
should
not
have
been
considered.
all
of
this--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
--
i
understand
that,
and
i
think
i
know
what
you
are
referring
to,
your
honor.
i
find
much
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
extremely
distasteful,
but
we
are
operating
under
a
land
of
laws
and
constitution.
and
it
seems
to
me
his
rights
are
as
important
--
i
know
this
court
appreciates
that
--
as
any
other
person's.
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
much
of
this
very
unattractive
evidence
came
in
before
the
law
was
ever
enacted.
and
i
think
what
happens
is
--
and
this
is
a
reality
psychologically
--
it
all
blends
together,
it
all
comes
together.
and
without
any
kind
of
instruction.
i
--
my
view
would
be,
under
ex
post
facto
principles,
it
would
have
ordinarily
been
excluded.
it
wouldn't
have
been
brought
in.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
in
all
due--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--in
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
cases
and
supreme
court
cases
have
held
that
the
ex
post
facto
law
has
been
extended
to
judicial
precedent.
and
we
cite
those
cases,
your
honor,
in
our
brief.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
it's
an
ex
post
facto
law
being
applied
through
the
due
process
clause.
but
the
impact
and
the
force
of
that,
i
think,
is
still
just
as
great
and
just
as
powerful.
and
--
and
--
and
the
error
here
factually
is
--
is
absolutely
enormous.
and
--
and
what
i
think
the
very
least
a
defendant
in
his
position
is
entitled
to
is
--
he's
suffering
under
a
9-year
sentence.
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
have
another
trial
where
he
is
only
confronted
with
the
evidence
that
came
after
the
statute.
and
if
they're
going
to
put
in
evidence
that
goes
before
that,
they
would
have
to
justify
that
under
one
of
a
number
of
different
concepts,
rule
404(b)
or
one
of
the
others.
and
we
would
argue
in
that
context
--
none
of
this
was
ever
done
in
court
--
under
403,
if
it
was
too
extensive,
the
prejudice
outweighs
the
probative
value.
and
i
think
that
many
judges
would
be
sympathetic
to
that,
for
putting
in
a
whole
2
years
of
conduct.
some
might
come
in--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--and
the
only
thing
that
i
would
think
of
immediately
of
that
is,
is
the
statute
here.
he
was
--
there's
no
question
the
--
the
--
the
conduct
was
forbidden
by
statutes
in
--
in
time,
but
was
applied
in
advance
of
those
statutes,
before--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
don't
have
a
quarrel
with
you
on
that.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
your
honor,
i'm
endeavoring
to
pursue
it,
but
somewhat
unsuccessfully.
this
is
not
an
evidentiary
error.
it
is
in
every
sense
a
due
--
an
ex
post
facto
error,
but
it
is
through
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
that
there
we
meet
on
common
ground.
it's
through
the
due
process
clause
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
made
--
made
effective
in
trial.
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
--
i
mean,
the
indictment
here,
which
you
start
with,
charged
these
crimes
going
all
the
way
back
to
january
of
1999,
when
the
act
didn't
come
--
didn't
become
effective
until
october
of
2000.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
if
all
the
conduct
that
was
proven
at
the--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
--
i
think
it
would--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--yes,
that's
right.
and
i
--
all
i'm
suggesting
is,
wherever
the
evidence
comes
from,
it
shouldn't
be
admitted
except
under
one
of
the
very
narrow
exceptions,
such
as
rule
404(b).
and
we
would
argue,
under
403,
it
should
be
excluded,
wherever
the
evidence
came
from.
and
a
judge
would
--
as
i
understand
it,
a
judge
would
instruct
the
jury:
you
cannot
convict
mr.
marcus
on
any
of
this
evidence
whatsoever
that
is
pre-enactment.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i
think
the
possibility
standard
only
applies
to
ex
post
facto
statute
cases
and
pre-enactment
conduct.
that's
my
view,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
very
narrow
holding.
and
i'm
not
urging
that
this
would
be
the
standard
for
other
--
other
than
ex
post
facto
cases,
and
i'm
not
urging
this
would
be
the
standard
in
ex
post
facto
cases
where
--
what
this
does,
your
honor,
if
you
stop
and
think
about
it,
it
is,
in
a
sense,
a
bright-line
rule.
what
has
gone
on
in
the
past
is
we
have
to
measure.
we
have
to
take,
on
the
one
hand,
the
post
--
enactment
conduct,
and
we
take,
on
the
other
hand,
the
pre-enactment
conduct,
and
we
go
through
this,
what
i
--
i'm
of
a
generation
--
i
remember
betts
v.
brady
before
gideon
came
down,
and
it
was
always
a
constant
citing
in
that
context
whether
a
person
got
able
representation
until
you
decided
the
gideon
case,
gideon
v.
wainwright.
aren't
we
in
the
same
position
here?
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
have
a
rule
that
said,
where
clearly
you
shouldn't
be
bringing
in
pre-enactment
conduct
anyway,
if
you
bring
in
pre-enactment
conduct
and
there
is
any
possibility
that
the
jury
convicted
on
that,
there
will
be
a
new
trial?
it
seems
that's
going
to
avoid
all
of
that
balancing
and
weighing
and
perennial
--
perennial
appellate
review.
that's
what
i
think
is
--
is
commendable
about
the
second
circuit's
decision.
i
think
that's
where
there
is
a
great
deal
of
sense
behind
it.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
yes,
absolutely.
and
this
doesn't
affect
that
whatsoever.
i
mean,
i
think
there's
a
misconception
among
some
people.
we
--
the
second
circuit
took
the
four
olano
factors
and
applied
them,
one,
two,
three,
four.
they
didn't
touch
them.
they
didn't
in
any
way
alter
them.
what
they
did
is,
on
the
concept
and
the
rule
governing
ex
post
facto
adjudications,
that
was
purely
substantive,
but
the
any
possibility
doesn't
apply
to
plain
error.
those
four
prongs
have
been
left
intact.
and
so
they
haven't
disturbed
that
in
any
way
whatsoever.
they
set
those
four
prongs
out
in
the
preamble
of
their
opinion.
obviously,
what
they
found
was,
when
you
have
a
case
of
this
magnitude
of
pre-enactment
conduct
of
2
years,
they
felt
that
that
certainly
affected
the
fairness
and
the
integrity
of
the
trial
and
the
judicial
reputation.
i
say
it
myself.
it
appeared
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times:
man
convicted
for
2
years
of
conduct
where
there
was
no
law.
that,
i
would
guess,
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
reputation
of
our
judicial
process,
whereas
a
ruling
where
a
court
held
this
man
should
go
back
and
get
a
new
trial
on
the
conduct
that
violated
the
statute,
and
not
on
conduct
that
violated
no
law,
would
enhance
the
reputation
of
the
courts.
so
applying
that
factor,
we
feel
strongly
and
powerfully
that
the
correct
disposition
here
is
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
and
we
will
go
back
and
we
will
have
a
retrial
on
the
conduct
that
violated
the
statute.
if
you
have
no
other
questions,
i
--
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
