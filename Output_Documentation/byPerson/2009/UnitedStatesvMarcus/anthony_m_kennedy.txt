under
three.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
answered
justice
alito
by
saying
there
are
cases
in
which
your
inquiry
is
more
searching,
more
demanding,
under
four.
it
might
also
be
the
other
way
around.
i
mean,
if
you
satisfy
--
if,
under
three,
you
find
that
it
hasn't
affected
the
outcome,
then
i
don't
know
where
you'd
go
under
four.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
there
--
there
is
an
overlap.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
point
may
be
tangential,
but
if
both
counsel
were
aware
of
the
date
problem,
that
2001
was
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
and
the
jury
was
later
properly
instructed,
do
you
think
that
the
government
would
find
it
important
to
introduce
the
evidence
of
the
pre-enactment
conduct,
just
to
set
forth
scheme,
plan,
design,
purpose,
to
tell
the
jury
the
story?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
this
is
ex
post
facto,
as
opposed
to
a
general
due
process
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
--
you
agree
that
there
is
a
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
that
i
think
most
trial
judges
would
have
admitted
this
evidence
with
the
proper
instruction
to
the
jury,
that
it's
background
evidence
so
you
--
you
can't
tell
the
jury
the
story
and
just
begin
in
2001,
or
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
i
agree
there
was
not
a
proper
instruction
here,
there
should
have
been
an
objection,
and
so
forth.
but
in
an
ordinary
trial,
this
evidence
would
have
come
in
with
the
proper
limiting
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
--
of
--
of
course,
the
jury
would
have
to
be
instructed
very
carefully.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
was
a
long
--
a
long
jury
deliberation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
can
be
pleased
that
i
was
not
the
trial
judge.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
thought
what
we
have
said
that
it's
just
a
violation
of
due
process
to
convict
someone
for
conduct
that
was
not
criminal
when
the
conduct
was
--
was
made.
it's
--
it's
--
it's
just
a
due
process
--
it's
a
due
process
violation.
it
just
--
it's
a
serious
due
process
violation.
