that
begs
the
question.
they
were
concerned
with
people
who
had
disappeared,
but
why
is
it
logical
for
them
to
be
worried
about
people
who
disappear
prospectively
as
opposed
to
the
people
who
have
already
disappeared
and
have
failed
to
--
that's
basically
the
--
the
government's
argument,
which
is:
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
statute
is
to
capture
those
people
who
have
disappeared.
and
so
why
limit
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
is
that
the
people
who
had
traveled
previously
and
failed
to
register
would
no
longer
be
subject
to
any
--
either
any
registration
process
or
presumably
any
punishment
either,
because
they
were
no
longer
in
the
state
in
which
the
conviction
occurred,
so
any
change
in
that
statute
wouldn't
affect
them.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
think
that
i
remain
a
little
bit
confused
by
the
question
one
of
my
colleagues
answered,
and
i'm
not
sure
if
this
last
answer
by
you
is
helping
me
understand
it,
which
is
if
sorna
now
--
if
every
state
is
supposed
to
pass
legislation
which
requires
sex
offenders
who
have
been
convicted
elsewhere
and
moved
to
their
state
to
register,
why
do
you
--
i
think
that's
what
you
--
that
you
answered
affirmatively
for
justice
kennedy,
correct?
sorna
requires
every
state
to
pass
laws
that
obligate
people
who
have
been
convicted
in
other
states
to
register,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
why
do
you
need
sorna?
why
can't
those
states
that
the
individual
has
moved
to
simply
prosecute
the
person
for
a
failure
to
register?
why
do
you
need
sorna?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--understand
some
of
the
delay
congress
may
have
in
passing
a
law
with
specifics
about
how
things
are
done.
are
you
worried
at
all
under
lambert
whether
or
not
there
might
be
a
due
process
violation
in
all
the
indeterminate
provisions
of
this
law?
where
do
you
--
yes,
you're
supposed
to
register,
but
states
don't
have
a
place
for
you
to
register,
and
now
you
are
supposed
to
know
that
you
are
supposed
to
register
under
the
old
systems,
and
you
don't
know
how
much
time
to
do
it
in.
justice
sonia

i
--
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--absolutely--
justice

--but
they
don't
have
a
sorna
place
to
register.
justice
sonia

the
sex
offender
registration
and
notification
act
or
sorna
establishes
a
federal
criminal
offense
covering
any
person
who
one;
is
required
to
register
under
sorna,
two;
travels
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
and
three;
knowingly
fails
to
register
or
update
a
registration.
this
provision
is
codified
at
18
usc
section
2250.
we
grant
the
certiorari
to
consider
whether
section
2250
applies
to
sex
offenders,
who
traveled
before
sorna’s
effective
date,
and
if
so
whether
the
statute
violates
the
constitution's
prohibition
on
ex-post
facto
laws.
we
hold
that
liability
under
section
2250
cannot
be
predicated
on
pre-enactment
travel
and
thus
have
no
occasion
to
address
the
constitutional
question.
our
decision
follows
from
the
text
of
the
statute.
section
2250
sets
forth
three
elements
that
must
be
satisfied
and
served
in
sequence.
first
a
person
must
be”required
to
register
under
sorna”,
second;
the
person
must
travel
in
interstate
commerce
and
third;
the
person
must
failed
to
register
as
required.
the
first
of
these
elements
are
requirements
to
register
under
sorna
pre-supposes
that
sorna
has
become
the
law.
the
acts
of
traveling
and
failing
to
register
must
therefore
also
occur
after
sorna’s
enactment.
the
statute’s
use
of
the
present
tense,
verb,
travels,
bolsters
our
conclusion.
we
are
not
aware
of
any
instance
in
which
we
have
construed
a
present
tense
verb
in
a
criminal
statute
to
prohibit
acts
that
were
completed
before
the
statute
took
effect.
the
government
contends
that
limiting
section
2250
to
post
enactment
travel
is
anomalous
because
it
means
that
the
statute
will
covers
state
sex
offenders,
less
often
than
federal
sex
offenders
or
liable
under
section
2250
without
proof
of
travel.
it
is
entirely
reasonable
however
for
congress
to
have
chosen
to
treat
state
and
federal
sex
offenders
differently,
give,
giving,
given,
the
state's
primary
responsibility
for
punishing
state
offenders
who
failed
to
register.
the
government
also
asserts
that
reading
section
2250
to
apply
only
to
post
sorna
travel
is
at
odds
with
congress’s
goal
of
locating
missing
sex
offenders.
section
2250
however
is
not
a
stand-alone
provision;
many
other
provisions
of
sorna
advance
this
broad
objective.
considering
the
structure
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
we
conclude
that
section
2250
serves
a
more
specific
function,
is
subject
to
federal
prosecution
sex
offenders
who
after
sorna’s
enactment
undermine
the
statue's
effectiveness
by
traveling
across
state
lines.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
thomas
and
ginsburg
join.
