mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
uses
ordinary
words
in
the
statute,
those
words
should
get
their
ordinary
meaning.
in
sorna,
the
sex
offender
registration
and
notification
act,
congress
did
use
ordinary
words,
and
it
used
them
in
an
ordinary
way.
but
the
government
proposes
that
those
words
be
given
a
most
extraordinary
reading.
it
suggests
that
congress
wrote
one
of
the
elements
of
sorna's
criminal
offense
in
a
sort
of
shorthand,
and
it
should
be
taken
to
mean
something
quite
different
than
what
congress
actually
said.
it
proposes--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i'll
try
to
keep
straight
each
of
the
parts
of
the
question.
a
couple
of
reactions.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
the
ordinary
assumption
is
that
when
the
present
tense
is
used
in
a
statute
that's
creating
a
criminal
offense,
it
refers
to
conduct
that
takes
place
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
we
are
not
aware
of
and
the
government
has
not
cited
any
decision
of
this
court
in
which
it
has
interpreted
a
present
tense
verb
used
in
a
criminal
statute
as
attaching
criminal
consequences
to
conduct
that
took
place
before
the
act
--
before
the
statute
was
enacted.
but
before
delving
too
deeply
into
the
present
tense
question,
i
think
it's
helpful
to
take
a
look
at
how
that
fits
into
the
other
elements
of
the
sorna
criminal
offense,
because
there
are
a
number
of
things
about
the
statutory
language
that
we
think
compel
the
conclusion
that
congress
had
in
mind
only
the
attachment
of
criminal
consequences
to
travel
that
took
place
after
sorna
was
enacted.
for
example,
and
to
begin
with,
the
first
element
of
the
offense,
which
provides
that
the
defendant
is
required
to
register
under
sorna,
the
government
says,
and
we
agree,
that
the
elements
of
the
sorna
offense
have
to
be
read
sequentially
so
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
only
if
he
or
she
commits
them
in
order.
the
first
element,
as
i
said,
the
statutory
text,
is
sorna.
and
it
seems
undeniable
that
a
defendant
is
not
and
cannot
possibly
be
required
to
register
under
sorna
until
sorna
is
enacted
and
is
on
the
books.
and
that
is
enough
to
dispose
of
this
case
because,
as
the
government
agrees,
the
elements
are
sequential.
the
first
element
is
that
there
is
a
requirement
to
register
under
sorna.
the
second
element,
the
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
has
to
follow
the
first
element.
the
travel,
therefore,
must
follow
the
enactment
of
sorna.
that
we
think
is
sufficient
to
dispose
of
this
case.
the
government's
answer
to
that
point
is
to
say
--
really,
to
candidly
acknowledge
that
the
statutory
language
has
to
be
rewritten
if
they're
to
prevail.
they
say
when
congress
said
"is
required"--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
are
not
questioning
that.
congress
specifically
authorized
in
sorna
that
the
attorney
general
had
the
authority
to
designate
pre-sorna
offenses
as
triggering
the
registration
requirement.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
--
it
certainly
is
unusual.
i
think
it's
not
for
us
to
comment
on
whether
that
was
a
sensible
thing
for
them
to
do.
but
we
don't
dispute
here
that
--
that
congress
did
it
and
that
the
attorney
general
was
authorized
to
do
what
he
did.
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it's
--
it's
actually
quite
helpful
to
our
argument
in
this
case
that
congress
was
aware
of
how
to
confer
retroactive
authority
on
the
attorney
general
for
some
things,
which
it
did,
the
designation
of
pre-sorna
sex
offenses
as
triggering
the
registration
requirement.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
their
argument.
but
the
way
that
they
reach
that
conclusion
is
to
say
that
the
first
element
of
the
offense,
which
is
sorna,
was
really
a
shorthand
by
which
congress
meant
"committed
a
sex
offense"
that
congress--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
--
we
agree,
but
i
think
--
we
do
not
agree,
obviously,
with
the
government's
understanding
of
the
first
element
of
the
offense.
it's
not
that
the
sex
offense
took
place.
it's
that
the
sorna
registration
requirement
attached.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
which
is
what
the
statute
says.
and,
again,
the
government's
only
attempt
to
answer
that
point
is
to
say
that
congress
actual
meant
something
different
when
it
wrote
the
first
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
they--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
of
course
don't
agree
with
the
government
on
everything,
but
we
do
agree
that
they
are
right
about
the
sequence,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
that
it
follows
--
i
think
it's
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
statutory
language
that
one
is
required
to
register,
travels
in
commerce,
and
knowingly
fails
to
register.
it
explains
why
congress
put
the
interstate
travel
element
second,
which
is
somewhat
a
peculiar
thing
to
do
otherwise.
and
if
that
were
not
the
case,
it
creates
the
problem
of
what
we
we've
been
calling
the
"lincoln
tunnel
baby".
if
someone
were
an
infant
traveling
and
went
through
the
lincoln
tunnel
from
new
york
to
new
jersey,
lived
in
new
jersey
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
committed
a
sex
offense
at
age
50
--
if
sequential
fulfillment
of
the
elements
was
not
necessary,
that
person
would
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
under
sorna.
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
sometimes
it
is
and
sometimes
it
isn't.
it's
certainly
not
a
universal
rule
that
it
has
to
be.
but,
again,
the
language
here
makes
that
a
sensible
rule.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no.
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--looking
for--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--you
would
have
to
make
it
up,
but
if
one
were
to
depart
from
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
says
"is
required
to
register
under
sorna.
"
so,
necessarily,
the
travel
took
place
after
sorna
was
enacted.
and
i
think
the
statutory
language
disposes
of
the
case.
there's
no
reason
to
look
beyond
that
to
broader
purposes.
but
if
one
does
look
to
the
purpose
of
sorna
and
what
congress
had
in
mind,
the
interstate
travel
requirement
and
attaching
that
the
travel
took
place
after
sorna
was
enacted
is
what
congress
wanted
to
do.
it
accomplishes
the
purpose.
congress
wrote
sorna
because
it
was
concerned
that
there
was
divergent
approach
to
registrations
that
were
taken
by
--
by
states,
that
they
had
inconsistent
applications
of
registration
programs.
this
was
creating
loopholes
that
allowed
sex
offenders
who
were
unregistered
not
to
register,
and
the
congressional
response
to
that
was
to
create
a
uniform
universal
system
of
registration
that
it
hoped
all
the
states
would
enact
that
would
facilitate
exchange
of
information
between
the
states
and
with
the
federal
government.
and
the
purpose
of
the
sorna
criminal
provision
in
that
context
is
that
it
was
designed
to
discourage
people
from
traveling,
unregistered
sex
offenders
from
traveling,
after
sorna
was
enacted
to
evade
the
new
sorna
registration
requirements.
for
that
purpose,
travel
before
sorna
is
immaterial.
it's
travel
after
sorna
is
enacted
that
--
that
brings
into
effect
the
congressional
purpose
that
they
were
trying
to
accomplish.
congress
wanted
to
keep
out
of
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
unregistered
sex
offenders
who
were
trying
to
evade
the
sorna
requirements.
that's
necessarily
prospective.
as
to
people
who
were
unregistered
sex
offenders
who
either
had
never
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
at
all
or
who
had
traveled
before
sorna
was
enacted,
they
are
identically
situated
for
sorna's
purposes.
they
are
outside
the
system.
they
are
not
registered.
no
one
knows
where
they
are.
they
are
not
attempting
to
evade
sorna
at
that
point.
they
are
subject
to
prosecution,
not
by
the
federal
government,
but
by
the
states
under
the
new,
more
punitive
regime
of
criminal
punishments
that
congress
tried
to
induce
the
states
to
enact
as
part
of
the
states'--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
states
have
generally
--
states
have
not
complied
with
sorna.
almost
universally,
they
have
not
complied
with
sorna.
but
one
thing
many
states
have
done
is,
in
fact,
enact
these
new,
more
punitive
criminal
provisions
for
people
who
have
failed
to
register,
as
did,
for
example,
indiana,
the
state
in
which
petitioner
here
was
not
registered.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
congress
had
in
mind
--
as
i
say,
it
was
addressing
a
particular
problem.
it
was
concerned
that
people
were
evading
registration
requirements
because
the
states
had
different
diverging
systems,
and
it
was
allowing
some
people
in
some
states
simply
not
to
register,
not
because
necessarily
they
were
evading
state
registration
requirements,
because
the
state
didn't
require
them
to
register.
states
had
very
different
systems
as
to
what
offenses
triggered
registration
requirements.
and
so
the
congressional
reaction
was
to
say:
we
want
the
states
to
enact
these
new,
much
more
comprehensive
and
intrusive
and
elaborate
registration
requirements.
and
they
are
so
--
so
elaborate
and
intrusive
that
the
states
are
refusing
to
do
it.
but
--
but
that
was
the
congressional
goal,
that
the
states
would
enact
these
--
these
regulatory
regimes;
people
would
then
register
under
them.
everybody
was
now
going
to
have
to
be
registered,
or
they
would
be
in
violation
of
some
state
law,
state
registration
requirement.
and
if
people
after
that
were
trying
to
get
off
the
grid,
disappear
by
moving
in
interstate
commerce,
the
sorna
criminal
provisions
would
come
into
effect
at
that
point.
for
people
who
stayed
put,
people
who
had
committed
a
sex
offense
before
sorna
was
enacted
and
just
stayed
there,
they
are
identically
situated,
as
i
said,
to
someone
who
never
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
at
all,
and
they
are
subject
to
prosecution
by
the
states.
clearly,
congress
did
not
intend
that
it
was
going
to
federalize
the
entire
regime
of
prosecuting
people.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
the
purpose
was
generally
to
encourage
registration
of
sex
offenders.
now,
of
course,
when
--
when
congress
wrote
the
statute,
as
--
as
has
been
pointed
out,
it
was
not
apparent
to
them
that
it
was
going
to
apply
to
people
who
had
committed
sex
offenses
before
sorna
was
enacted
at
all.
that
turned
upon
the
attorney
general's
subsequent
determination.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
two
points--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it
--
it's
--
to
--
to
be
honest,
i
think
it's
not
entirely
clear
that
congress
had
anything
specific
in
mind
beyond
a
reaction
to
the
prior
regime
in
which
there
were
inconsistent
approaches
being
taken
by
the
states.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
at
the
time
they--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--all
states
did
require
registration
of
some
sort
or
another,
but
they
had
different
registration
systems
and
different
requirements
in
their
registration
systems.
there
were
--
there
were
inconsistencies
in
them.
the
one
thing
which
appears
from
the
legislative
background
of
sorna
is
that
congress
was
concerned
about
loopholes
in
various
state
registration
regimes,
and
it
wanted
to
have
a
much
more
comprehensive,
universal,
uniform
system
of
registration.
so
to
address
your
point
specifically
about
the
jurisdictional
hook,
i
think
there
are
two
reactions
to
that.
one
is,
even
if
it
were
a
jurisdictional
hook,
it
is
an
element
of
the
offense.
no
one
denies
that.
it
has
to
be
interpreted
as
written.
it
says
interstate
travel,
as
we
read
it,
after
sorna
was
enacted.
so
i
think
that
answers
the
--
the
question.
but
--
but
it
--
but
it
was,
i
would
add,
more
than
a
jurisdictional
hook,
because
congress
had
in
mind
this
particular
problem
of
--
of
people
who,
post-sorna,
were
going
to
be
evading
these
new,
more
comprehensive
requirements
by
simply
disappearing.
not
that
they
were
complying
with
state
regimes
which
--
which
didn't
require
them
to
register,
but
they
would
simply
cross
state
lines
to
vanish.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that's
--
that's
right.
the
government's
argument
is
--
is
an
appeal
to
what
it
sees
as
the
gestalt
of
sorna,
rather
than
the
statutory
language.
but
i
--
i
--
but
i
think
the
answer
to
your
--
your
question
specifically,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
they
were
--
they
--
that
when
congress
passed
the
statute,
it
--
it
had
in
mind
this
division
of
responsibility
in
--
in
criminal
enforcement.
it
--
it
expected
that
the
states,
in
order
to
comply
with
sorna,
were
going
to
enact
these
new
and
much
more
--
more
punitive
criminal
regimes
to
punish
people
who
did
not
register.
and
so
far
as
sorna
was
concerned,
people
who
never
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
and
people
who
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
before
sorna
was
enacted
are
identically
situated.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
--
under
the
--
the
new
regime
that
congress
anticipated
would
--
would
be
put
in
place,
every
state
would
enact,
would
have
in
place
a
--
a
criminal
punishment.
and
these
were
--
these
states
don't
punish
people
simply
who
committed
a
sex
offense
in
that
state
and
failed
to
register.
they
require
registration
of
sex
offenders
who
committed
sex
offenses
anywhere.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
they
do.
so
--
and
in
that
sense
mirroring
the
current
interpretation
of
sorna
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
absolutely.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
all
states--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
believe
that
universally--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--they
did
not
distinguish
based
on
the
location
of
where
the
sex
offense
took
place.
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
--
the
various
registration
--
state
registration
laws
that
existed
pre-sorna,
that
--
all
the
states
had
registration
requirements,
but
--
but
they
differed
in
a
number
of
respects.
which
sex
offenses
would
trigger
the
registration
requirement,
for
example.
so
--
so,
there
were
people
who
--
who
may
well
have
been
sex
offenders
in
--
in
the
broadest
sense
under
--
under
the
sorna,
a
very
broad
definition,
but
who
were
not
required
to
register
in
the
state
in
which
they
--
they
lived
because
that
state's
law
did
not
have
--
list
their
offense
as
a
triggering--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
is
possible
after
sorna
that
--
that
states
will
enact
criminal
regimes
that
don't
--
that
don't
mirror
the
sorna
--
the
sorna
definition,
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
sorna--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
under
the
sorna
regime
if
the
states
all
implemented
sorna
as
congress
anticipated
that
they
would,
if
they
all
enacted
these
statutes,
i
think
that
there
wouldn't
be
--
the
only
concern
would
be
that
people
would
simply
fail
to
register,
they
would
then
disappear--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--altogether.
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
is
what
sorna
is
directed
at.
sorna
is
directed
at
people
--
they
are
now
all
subject
to
registration
requirements.
sorna
is
directed
at
the
concern
that
people
simply
won't
register.
and
--
and
it's
designed
after
sorna
goes
into
effect,
and
there
are
these
new
requirements
on
the
books.
the
people--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
--
that's
--
that's
quite
right.
and
sorna
addresses
these
problems
by
saying,
first
of
all,
the
states
all
have
to
--
have
to
pool
their
information
and
exchange
them.
secondly,
when
the
--
when
the
sex
offender
moves
from
one
state
to
another,
he
or
she
is
required
to
register
in
the
new
state,
has
to
notify
both
--
both
the
state
and
federal
authorities.
so
it
is
designed
--
sorna
itself
is
designed
to
be
a
comprehensive
response
to
this
problem,
encouraging
state
cooperation.
and
that
is
why
if
we
are
looking
at
the
policy
and
--
and
just
not
paying
attention
to
the
language
for
the
moment,
the
focus
was
on
post-sorna
activity,
because
congress
has
put
in
place
this
new
regime
which
is
supposed
to
address
the
problem
of
missing
sex
offenders.
people
who
are
taking
steps
after
sorna
goes
into
effect,
you
know,
offenders,
to
evade
their
registration
requirements
are
now
subject
to
these
new,
more
comprehensive
federal
penalties
as
well
as
state
penalties.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
those
states
could
do
that.
and
i
--
as
to
why
we
need
sorna,
why
congress
thought
that
sorna
was
a
good
idea,
i
--
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons.
one
is
that
there
are
federal
offenders
and
congress,
i
think,
believed
that
it
was
a
special
federal
responsibility
to
--
to
make
sure
that
federal
sex
offenders
were
registered.
and
in
addition,
congress
regarded
the
problem
of
--
of
unregistered
sex
offenders
as
a
federal
problem,
and
it
was
one
that,
after
sorna
was
enacted
and
this
new
systematic
regime
was
put
in
place,
was
more
appropriate
for
federal
prosecution.
but
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes.
sorna
is
much
more
expansive
both
in
--
in
the
type
of
information
that's
required
and
in
the
mechanism,
in
requiring
in-person
registration
by--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
is
--
that's
possible,
too,
and
again
that
is
a
prospective
focus.
and,
of
course,
i
--
my
final
point
is
that
discussion
of
the
purpose
i
think
illuminates
this
to
some
extent,
but
the
language
itself
is
absolutely
clear.
there
is
no
reason
to
go
beyond
the
plain
text
of
the
statute.
and
if
i
can
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
--
those
all
appear
in
the
civil
registration
provision,
not
in
the
criminal
provision.
and
my
answer
to
justice
alito's
question
is
that
we
are
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
the
congress
has
used
a
present-tense
verb
in
a
criminal
statute
to
attach
criminal
consequences
to
conduct
that
took
place
before
the
statute
was
enacted.
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
at
the
time
that
congress--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
correct.
at
the
time
that
congress
wrote
those
civil
provisions,
this
statute,
on
its
face,
applied
prospectively
only.
the
attorney
general
had
not
yet
retroactively
applied
it.
congress
specifically
gave
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
apply
it
retroactively
in
defining
which
offenders
had
to
register.
it
did
not
give
him
any
authority
to
retroactively
change
the
scope
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
--
that's
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
say
that's
our
principal
argument.
that's
one
of
our
arguments,
and
the
argument
which
i
think
is
dispositive.
given
the
way
that
the
attorney
general
--
the
solicitor
general
has
presented
the
case
relates
to
the
first
element
of
the
offense,
which
is
that
the
action
--
the
offender
is
required
to
register
under
sorna,
which,
as
we
have
said,
has
to
take
place
after
sorna
is
enacted.
i
think
mr.
gannon
candidly
acknowledged
that
basically,
that
has
to
be
read
to
mean
something
different.
it
has
to
be
read
to
mean
"is
a
sex
offender",
and
that
is
simply
not
a
plausible
reading
of
the
statute.
not
only
because
of
the
plain
words
"is
required
to
register",
but
the
provision
of
the
offense
which
addresses
federal
sex
offenders
sets
out
three
elements
as
to
them.
as
to
a
federal
sex
offender,
it
must
be
someone
who
is
required
to
register.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
an
earlier
version
said
"travels
thereafter".
i
--
that
was
dropped,
i
would
suggest,
as
superfluous,
because
the
present-tense
language
encompasses
that.
but
it
--
it
would
not
make
sense
to
say
--
if
one
disregards
the
temporal
sequence,
that
brings
back
the
lincoln
tunnel
baby.
it
would
mean
that
someone
could
have
traveled
as
an
infant,
and
that
satisfies
the
sorna
travel
requirements.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
i'd
suggest,
justice
alito,
that
requires
an
extensive
rewriting
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
and
one
has
to
--
one
would
have
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
one
has
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
and
even
so,
one
has
to
read
into
that
limitation
as
to
where
--
why
it
is
that
there
is
that
limit
on
--
on
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--"has
committed
a
sex
offense".
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'd
suggest
that
that's
a
peculiar
reading
of
the
term
"is
required
to
register",
that,
as
written,
it
seems
to
me
as
a
present
--
tense
requirement.
you
are
now
currently
required
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
statute.
it
does
not
say:
you
are
required
--
you
are
a
sex
offender
within
--
as
subsequently
defined
by
sorna.
as
congress
did
expressly
say
in
the
federal
offender
provision
in
section
(2)(a).
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
your
honor.
