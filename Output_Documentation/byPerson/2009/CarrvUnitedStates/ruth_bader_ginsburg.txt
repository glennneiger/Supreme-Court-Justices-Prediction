mr.
rothfeld,
would
you
clarify
one
thing?
you're
not
questioning
the
attorney
general's
determination
that
the
underlying
sex
offense
can
have
occurred
pre-sorna?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
part
of
it
is
there
was
a
--
sorna
requires
a
lot
more
information
than
was
required
under
the
state
statutes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
clarify--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
you
clarify
what
you
mean
by
"the
statute
comes
into
effect"?
because
if
i
understand
correctly,
there's
only
one
state
and
one
indian
tribe
that
are
in
compliance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be
what
their--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
their
old
law
was.
it
wouldn't
be
--
you
have
--
sorna
is
in
effect,
but
what
the
state
is
implementing
is
the
pre-sorna
state
law,
right?
