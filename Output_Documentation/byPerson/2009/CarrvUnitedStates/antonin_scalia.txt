justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
as
though
he
was
authorized
to
make
something
a
crime
which
wasn't
--
which
wasn't
a
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
authorized
to
say
you
have
to
register.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you're
saying
it
has
to
take
place
not
just
after
the
offense,
but
after
the
obligation
to
register.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
assuming
it
does
depend
on
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
what
would
the
purpose
--
it
wouldn't
cover
his
transportation
as
an
infant.
what
does
he
have
to
be,
20
years
old?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
15
years
old?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
is
it
20
years
before
the
offense
or
25
years
before
the
offense?
i
guess
we
could
make
it
up,
couldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
which
the
states
didn't
enact.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
that
be
the
case
after
sorna,
that
some
states
would
have
less
extensive
coverage
than
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
unless
that
could
be
the
case,
then
i
don't
see
what
is
achieved
by
--
why
you
worry
about
somebody
moving
to
another
state
in
order
to
evade
the
registration.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
the
new
state
requires
you
to
register
just
as
much
as
the
old
one,
what
are
you
worried
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
fail
to
register
entirely?
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
congress--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
conceivable
also
that
congress
was
--
was
not
confident
that
the
states
would
be
as
active
in
prosecuting
violations
as
the
federal
government
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
--
where?
(2)(a)?
which
is
where?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
"or"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
they
don't
have
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
long
ago--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
know
where
you
get
that
from.
i
can
understand
how
you
can
say,
which
is
what
mr.
rothfeld
says,
that
it
has
to
follow
the
requirement
to
register.
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads:
whoever,
one,
is
required
to
register,
not
whoever
has
committed
an
offense
that
--
that
would
later
justify
registration.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
just
making
up
the
--
the
prior
act
that
--
that
triggers
the
interstate
travel
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
text
do
you
base
it
on?
(1)
says
"is
required
to
register",
and
the
position
of
the
petitioner
is:
after
you
are
required
to
register,
you
must
travel
in
interstate
commerce.
and
you
say:
no,
it's
after
you
commit
the
offense
that
you
must
travel
in
interstate.
where
do
you
get
that
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
--
but
it
doesn't,
because
if
you
haven't
been
--
if
you
are
convicted
of
a
federal
offense,
you
are
automatically
in,
but
if
you
are
convicted
of
a
state
offense,
you're
in
only
if
you
travel
in
interstate
commerce
after
that
offense.
so
you
don't
resolve
the
inconsistency
between
(a)
and
(b).
there
is
still
going
to
be
some
inconsistency
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that's
a
much
less
powerful
point.
there
is
inconsistency
between
(a)
and
(b),
no
matter
what
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
where
--
where
it
means
prior
travel,
it
says
so,
use
of
a
firearm
that
has
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
they
use
the
past
tense
when
they
mean
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rothfeld,
i
hate
to
eat
up
any
of
your
rebuttal
time,
but
this
is
sort
of
by
way
of
unfinished
business.
justice
alito
asked
three
questions
at
the
beginning
of
this
interesting
exercise.
i
think
you
only
answered
the
first.
i
don't
even
remember
the
third
anymore.
[laughter]
but
i
was
interested
in
the
second,
which
mentioned
other
provisions
in
this
--
in
this
very
statute
that
--
that
use
the
present
tense.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
change
the
language
"is
required
to
register"
to
"has
committed
a"--
