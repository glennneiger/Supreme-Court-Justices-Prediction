mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
offense
under
18
u.s.c.
2250(a)
occurred
when
he
failed
to
register
as
required
by
sorna
well
after
sorna
was
enacted.
as
justice
ginsburg
elucidated,
he
does
not
dispute
that
the
first
paragraph
of
sorna
can
be
triggered
by
a
pre-sorna
conviction,
and
adopting
his
construction
of
paragraph
(2)(b)
would
create
a
serious
structural
anomaly
between
the
federal
offenders,
with
whom
there
is
no
requirement
that
they
engage
in
any
post-sorna
conduct
other
than
the
failure
to
register,
and
the
state
sex
offenders,
who
are
the
majority
of
the
missing
sex
offenders
that
congress
intended
to
capture
by
enacting
the
new
registration
regime
and
ensuring
that
there
would
be
a
serious
federal
penalty
that
would
encourage
offenders
who
had
used
interstate
travel
to
evade
their
registration
requirements
to
get
back
on
the
registration
rolls.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
we
don't
think
he
was
in
violation
of
the
law
the
instant
it
was
passed
for
purposes
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause;
under
cases
like
tranbarger
and
samuels,
we
think
that
he
did
have
a
reasonable
period
of
time
to
comply
with
the
new
obligation.
this
is
a
problem
that
would
occur
with
all
sorts
of
federal
criminal
statutes
based
on
a
status
that
somebody
was
in
at
the
time
something
was
made
criminal.
in
the
--
in
the
case
prohibiting
possession
of
handguns
by
persons
who
had
been
convicted
of
misdemeanor
crimes
of
domestic
violence,
that
this
court
upheld
that
statute
last
year,
when
that
statute
came
into
effect,
if
somebody
had
the
relevant
conviction
on
the
books
and
possessed
a
handgun,
they
would
have
been
guilty
at
the
instant
the
statute
came
into
effect,
but
they
would
have
been
allowed
a
reasonable
period
to
come
into
compliance.
that's
the
reasoning
that
the
court
used
in
tranbarger
and
in
samuels;
somebody
who
acquired
alcohol
legally
before
a
statutory
prohibition
provision
came
into
effect
would
be
given
a
reasonable
period
of
time
to
divest
himself
of
possession.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
it's
going
to
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
individual
case,
as
the
tranbarger
court
recognized.
in
--
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
where
somebody
is
typically
allowed
only
3
business
days
to
update
their
registration,
we
think
it
would
be
a
fairly
short
period.
it's
something
that
--
that
--
that
may
depend
on
all
sorts
of
circumstances.
if
petitioner
--
or
if
a
defendant,
a
sex
offender,
was
in
the
hospital
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
unable
to
make
it
to
the
registry,
that
would
provide
him
with
an
--
an
affirmative
defense
under
the
text
of
2250(b).
and
--
and
so
--
but
we
do
think
that
this
is
a--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
--
in--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
that
--
that's
right,
and
--
but
i
--
but
we
do
think
that
it
is
a
background
principle
in
--
in
all
of
these
cases
that
if
somebody
is
literally
unable
to
avoid
the
criminal
consequences
of
their
pre-enactment
conduct,
that
that
would
raise
the
concerns
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
intended
to
solve.
and
in
cases
like--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
this
--
i
mean,
this
is
--
that's
--
we
--
we
think
that
somebody
does
need
a
reasonable
time
to
come
into
compliance.
it
doesn't
need
to
be
a
long
time.
but
this
is
an
issue
that
--
that
exists
in
the
statute
completely
separate
from
the
travel
requirement
here.
the
federal
offenders
who
are
--
who
are
covered
by
paragraph
(2)(a)
--
there's
no
requirement,
there's
no
actus
reus
for
them
under
2250,
other
than
the
fact
that
they
have
a
previous
conviction,
which
can
be
pre-sorna.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
this
is
in
2250(a)(2)(a).
it's
on
page
1a
of
the
government's
appendix.
and
so
paragraph
(2)
is
divided
between
(a)
and
(b)--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--(a)
applies
to
sex
offenders
who
--
who
are
sex
offenders
by
virtue
of
a
conviction
under
federal
or
tribal
law.
federal
law--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--they
don't
have
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
because
of
the
(a)
and
(b).
the
only
thing
they
have
to
do--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--is
then
knowingly
fail
to
register
or
update
a
registration
as
required
by
sorna
in
paragraph
(3).
and
so
the
reasonable
grace
period
question
for
purposes
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
here
is
not
something
that
the
court
can
--
can
sidestep
by
deciding
that
interstate
travel
needs
to
occur
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
and,
indeed,
if
somebody
were
traveling
on
the
day
the
statute
was
enacted,
there
would
still
be
a
question
about
whether
they
had
a
reasonable
time
to
comply.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it
--
it
was
a
few
days
at
the
time.
he
was
also
required
under
alabama
law
--
when
he
registered
and
signed
a
sex
offender
registration
form
in
alabama
in
2004,
it
said
that
he
was
required
to
notify
the
law
enforcement
authorities
in
the
jurisdiction
of
his
new
residence
within
10
days
of
his
arrival
there.
and
the
indiana
law
was
--
was
i
believe
a
period
of
7
or
10
days
at
--
at
the
time.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
the
--
the
period
is
specified
under
--
under
sorna
with
--
when,
once
the--
sorna
registration--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--regime
comes
into
effect.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
it
does
require
in
--
in
16913(c),
that
somebody
update
the
registration
after
a
change
in
residence
within
3
business
days
of
--
of
coming
to
the
new
residence.
and
so
we
--
we
do
think
that
that
would
be
relevant
in
evaluating
what
would
be
a
reasonable
time
period
to
come
into
compliance
here.
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
--
that
after
the
statute
already
comes
into
effect,
that
it
would
--
it
would
require
somebody
to
comply
within
3
days.
if
they
moved
a
year
later,
then
--
then
that
should
be
a
reasonable
time
period
to--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
that's
--
that's
partly
true,
justice
ginsburg.
since
--
since
the
press
release
that's
cited
in
the
briefs,
another
indian
tribe
has
come
into
substantial
compliance.
but
what's
important
here
is
that
that's
just
a
question
of
whether
the
state
is
in
substantial
compliance
with
sorna's
requirements
for
purposes
of
receiving
federal
funding
under
--
under
the
byrne
program.
and
here
even
if
a
state
has
not
come
into
substantial
compliance
--
and
indiana
has
not
yet
been
certified
as
having
come
into
substantial
compliance
--
it
still
had
a
functioning
sex
offender
registry
that
would
take
most
of
the
information
that
sorna
required
petitioner
to
provide,
things
like
his
name,
his
physical
characteristics--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--his
--
his
address--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it's
true
that,
especially
before
sorna
was
enacted,
that
that's
all
the
state
was
doing,
if
the
state
has
amended
its
law
since
then,
and
indiana
did
update
its
law
in
2006.
but
to
the
extent
--
so
the
state
may
well
accept
congress's
invitation
to
restructure
its
registration
system
to
match
what
sorna
requires,
but
even
when
a
state
has
not
yet
done
that,
there's
no
doubt
that
someone
like
petitioner
can
go
in
and
register.
he
was
supposed
to
be
registered,
and,
indeed,
after
he
was
arrested
in
a
--
in
an
incident
in
2007,
he
did
register
under
indiana
law,
and
he
provided
the
information
that
indiana
was
willing
to
take.
and
so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
we
think
that
that's
not
covered
under
the
sequencing
argument
that
we've
made,
which
--
which
partakes
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
that
justice
alito
was
talking
about
and
--
and
the
order
in
which
the
relevant
acts
occur.
as
long
as
somebody
is
already
a
convicted
sex
offender
of
the
kind
that
sorna
requires
to
register,
and
they
are
within
the
time
period
within
which
sorna
would
require
them
to
register
--
and
petitioner
here
is
a
tier
ii
sex
offender,
so
he
would
be
required
to
register
for
15
years
after
his
2004
sex
offense
conviction.
as
long
as
he
is
within
that
period
when
he
engages
in
the
travel,
then
we
think
that
it's
within
the
heartland
of
what
congress
was
concerned
about,
which
is
a
sex
offender
who
is
engaging
in
interstate
travel--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--is--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it's
--
no,
it's
--
you
have
to
have
been
convicted
of
a
sex
offense,
because
that
--
that's
what
brings
you
within
the
category
of
persons--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
don't
think
that
we
are
making
it
up,
justice
scalia.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
we
get
that
from
the
facts
--
from
the
context
here,
from
the
anomaly
that
would
be
created,
the
structural
anomaly
about
the
differential
treatment
between
federal
and
state
sex
offenders.
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
recapture
missing
sex
offenders,
which
are
persons
who
engaged
in
interstate
travel
to
elude
the
registration
requirements
that
already
apply
to
them
as
sex
offenders.
and
so
we
think
that
when
congress
invoked
the
--
its
powers
to
regulate
travel
and
interstate
commerce,
in
order
to
give
that
element
meaning,
we
think
that
it
makes
sense
to
apply
it
to
persons
who
already
have
the
type
of
sex
offense
convictions
that
sorna
requires
them
to
register
for.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
we
get
it
from
the
context.
that's
right.
and
we
know
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
can't
completely
control
this
inquiry,
because
the
congress
changed
the
language
that
existed
earlier
in
the
drafting
process
of
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
there
is
something
like
that,
but
that's
not
all
that's
going
on.
on
page
26
of
the
house
report--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that
you're
talking
about,
justice
breyer,
it
specifically
says
that
sex
offenders
who
fail
to
comply
will
face
felony
criminal
prosecution.
and
this
--
this
was
a
way--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
it's--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
congress
did
pass
the
statute
for
--
for
multiple
reasons
in
--
in
order
to
encourage
there
to
be
a
more
effective,
comprehensive
nationwide
registration
scheme.
and
one
of
the
things
that
that
required
was
--
anticipated,
was
standardization
among
the
states.
but
it
was
also
--
these
--
mr.
carr
was
required
to
register
both
by
the
law
of
alabama
and
by
the
law
of
indiana
at
the
time
when
he
committed
his
sex
offense
and
when
he
moved
from
one
state
to
the
other.
congress
considered
that
type
of
regime
as
being
inadequate.
congress
obviously
thought
that
the
state
violations
that
were
occurring
with
100,000
sex
offenders
who
had
eluded
registration,
gone
underground,
was
a
problem
they
wanted
to
solve.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
it
--
it
first
of
all
imposes
a
federal
registration
requirement.
so
in--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
16913--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it's
--
it's
not
just
that
he's
afraid
of
the
feds
when
they
can
come
with
prosecutorial
powers
under
section
2250.
it
is
also,
as
you
say,
that
there
are
several
aspects
of
sorna
that
will
encourage
there
to
be
much
more
cooperation
among
jurisdictions
in
standardizing
this
information,
notifying
different
jurisdictions
when
somebody
moves
from
one
to
another--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
that
--
that's
true,
but
we
already
know
that
this
is
true
without
regard
to
post-sorna
travel
for
persons
who
have
federal
sex
offense
convictions.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think,
to
the
extent
that
the
committee
report
identified
100,000
missing
sex
offenders
as
the
most
significant
enforcement
problem
in
the
sex
offender
context,
10
years
after
every
single
state
and
the
federal
government
had
passed
a
panoply
of
sex
offender
registration
requirements,
shows
that
they
were
concerned
about
persons
who
had
fallen
off
the
sex
offender
registry
rolls.
and
that
this
provision,
if
it
is
--
if
it
is
read
to
treat
federal
and
state
sex
offenders
more
consistently,
which
is
to
require
them
both
--
to
subject
them
both
to
potential
federal
prosecution
if
they
knowingly
fail
to
register
after
sorna
comes
into
effect--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--there
is
going
to
be
some
inconsistency--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--but
we
think
that
it's
dramatically
lessened,
and
it's
important
in
this
context
to--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--there
is,
but
the
vast
majority
of
the
100,000
sex
offenders
that
were
missing
were
people
who
would
have
been
convicted
under
state
sex
offenses.
and
most
of
the
--
most
of
the
705,000
registered
sex
offenders
in
the
country
right
now
have
been
convicted
under
--
under
state
provisions,
rather
than
federal--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
think
that
lots
of
jurisdictional
hooks
referring
to
travel
and
interstate
commerce
are
phrased
in
present
tense.
there
are
--
there
are
a
handful
that
--
that
are
--
are
specifically
tailored
and
have
extra
language,
like
the
one
we
cite
dealing
with
gambling
devices
that
have
been
transported
in
interstate
commerce
after
the
effective
date
of
that
particular
statute.
but,
for
the
most
part,
i
think
that
they
are
phrased
in
present
tense
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
--
i'm
not
aware
of
--
of
a
provision
that's
--
that's
phrased
like
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--where
that
--
where
those
are
the
only
things
that
are
at
issue.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
that's
--
that's
true.
in
most
instances
in
which
congress
has
an
interstate
travel
element,
that's
true.
in
some
--
in
some
cases
like
the
--
the
statute
at
issue
in
the
trupin
case
about
possession
of
--
of
stolen
goods
that
have
traveled
in
interstate
commerce,
that
--
that's
--
that's
--
that's
an
invocation
of--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
those
cases
in
context,
i
think
it
was
easiest
to
say
that
when
it
has
traveled
vis-à-vis
the
act
that
was
in
question
there.
and
--
and
here
--
neither
side
is
contending
that
--
that
the
travel
can
happen
after
the
failure
to
register
and
somebody
immediately
then
becomes
guilty
of
the
offense.
we
think
that
the
sequencing
requirement
makes
sense
on
both
ends,
that
somebody
needs
to
have
the
sex
offense
conviction
before
they
travel,
and
then
they
need
to
fail
to
register
after
they
have
--
they
have
engaged
in
the
travel,
because
that's
the
concern
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at,
persons
who
were
able
to
use
the
fact
of
interstate
travel
to
evade
registration.
and
the
reason,
mr.
chief
justice,
why
i
think
that
congress
didn't
include
a
purpose
requirement
there
is
because
congress
didn't
want
sex
offenders
to
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
they
had
another
good
reason
to
travel.
if
my
employer
transfers
me
from
one
state
to
another,
and
then
i
take
advantage
of
that
situation
to
go
underground
and
not
re-register,
that's
one
of
the
100,000
missing
sex
offenders
that
congress
was
concerned
about,
even
though
i
would
have
had
a
good
defense
to
the
charge
that
i
had
traveled
with
the
purpose
or
for
the
purpose
of
evading
sex
offender
registration
requirements.
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
you
were
asking
a
question
about
--
about
why
the
--
what
the
purpose
would
be
served
here
if
states
would
already
have
the
underlying
offense
that
would
be
made
criminal
by
sorna.
i
think
that
there
are
a
couple
different
answers
to
that.
mr.
rothfeld
acknowledged
that
congress
may
well
have
intended
there
to
be
extra
force
that
would
come
from
the
--
from
the
federal
prosecution
itself.
but
separately
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
--
that
states
were
given
time
to
comply
with
sorna,
to
come
into
substantial
compliance
with
sorna.
and
--
and
even
though
no
state
at
this
point
has
said
that
they
don't
intend
to
come
into
compliance
with
sorna,
congress
couldn't
necessarily
have
expected
states
to
adopt
the
particular
offense
that
they
--
that
they
were
concerned
about.
and
i
think
that
--
that
--
that
here
congress
did
want
to
--
to
cover
that
situation.
one
other
factual
point
that's
associated
with
the
--
the
effectiveness
there
that
was
brought
up
in
the
briefs
and
hasn't
come
up
today
is
the
question
of
--
of
when
the
prior
wetterling
act
offenses
were
repealed.
and
i
--
i
--
in
section
129
of
sorna,
the
wetterling
act
offense
was
repealed
effective
3
years
after
the
date
of
sorna's
effective
date,
even
without
regard
to
the
1-year
extensions
issued
by
the
attorney
general,
notwithstanding
a
point
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
simply
because
section
129
doesn't
incorporate
124(b),
which
has
the
extension
provision
for
the
attorney
general.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
i
think
here
that
there
--
the
question
of
notice
and
knowledge
has
not
been
an
issue
because
it's--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
i
think
that's
--
this
--
one
of
the
things
you
said
is
the
states
may
not
have
a
place
to
register.
and
that's
--
that's
just
not
true.
since
--
since
before
1996,
every
state
has
had
a
sex
offender
registry.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
--
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
it's
the
same
place.
what
sorna
requires
is
that
you
provide
the
following
types
of
information
to
the
relevant
officials
that
run
the
sex
offender
registry
for
the
jurisdiction.
and
"jurisdiction"
is
defined
to
include
the
state.
and,
so,
in
--
in
--
in
these
cases,
even
if
the
state
hasn't
changed
the
name
on
the
door
to
sorna
registration
facility
--
it's
just
sex
offender
registration
facility
under,
you
know,
zachary's
law,
which
is
the
name
of
the
indiana
sex
offender
registration
law,
as
opposed
to
megan's
law
--
there
is
--
they
are
still
required
by
sorna
to
register,
which
requires
them
to
give
information
to
the
relevant
officials
in
the
relevant
jurisdiction.
and
the
jurisdiction
is
there;
the
officials
are
there.
they
are
taking
the
information.
as
long
as
the
officials
will
take
the
information,
the
failure
to
do
that
is
a
violation
of
2250.
and
there's
one
--
one
other
point
that
petitioner
was
making
in
the
reply
brief
was
that
there
seemed
to
be
some
confusion
about
--
about
whether
there
was
an
offense
under
sorna
when
states
had
not
yet
come
into
compliance
or
whether
that
would
have
been
an
offense
only
under
the
pre-sorna
wetterling
act.
and
--
and
the
reason
that
there
isn't
a
sorna
violation
there,
if
--
if
a
state
has
not
yet
decided
to
accept
things
like
digital
palm
prints
or
whatever
the
extra
information
is
that
sorna
would
require,
the
--
the
defendant
is
still
required
to
provide
that,
what
information
the
state
will
accept.
and
the
affirmative
defense
in
2250(b)
would
only
be
applicable
in
circumstances
where
the
state
wouldn't
take
that
extra
information.
so
it's
only
those
aspects
of
sorna
that
are
above
and
beyond
what
the
state
will
allow
the
offender
to
do,
that
he's
excused
from
complying
with
by
the
affirmative
defense,
that
it's
uncontrollable
circumstances
that
he
--
that
he
can't
provide
a
dna
sample
or
a
palm
print
in
a
particular
state
that
doesn't
do
that
yet.
but
as
long
as
the
state
is
taking
the
rest
of
the
information,
he
needs
to
give
that.
and
this
is
a
case
where
petitioner
utterly
failed
to
give
any
of
the
information
to
indiana
once
he
arrived
there
at
the
end
of
2004
or
beginning
of
2005.
so,
there's
--
there's
no
dispute
that
the
state
would
have
taken
that
information
had
he
been
in
compliance
with
that
law.
once
sorna
later
came
into
effect,
he
probably
wouldn't
have
been
in
violation
of
sorna
at
that
point.
but
--
but
that
--
there's
nothing
unusual
about
the
fact
that
he
could
have
engaged
in
pre-enactment
conduct
that
would
have
prevented
him
from
being
in
violation,
just
as
the
person
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
possession
--
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence,
if
he
doesn't
possess
a
gun
before
the
--
the
new
provision
in
922
comes
into
effect,
then
he
hasn't
committed
the
offense.
if
somebody
doesn't
acquire
the
alcohol
before
the
statutory
prohibition
comes
into
effect
that
was
at
issue
in
samuels
before
that
law
came
into
effect,
then
he
hadn't
committed
the
offense.
so,
there's
nothing
unusual
about
saying
that
he
could
have
complied
with
sorna
effectively
in
anticipation
of
its
being
enacted,
even
though
it
didn't
yet
exist.
the
--
the
--
the
question
here
is
whether
he
knowingly
failed
to
register
as
required
by
sorna
after
it
came
into
effect.
and
--
and
we
think
that
--
that
--
that
he
did,
because
he
had
already
engaged
in
the
interstate
travel
after
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
sex
offense.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that's
--
that's
true
under
section
42
u.s.c.
16913.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
that's
true.
the
registration
requirement
applies
without
regard--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--if
you
fall
within
(2)(b)--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
person
who
--
who
has
to--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
order
to
--
to
meet
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--to
meet
the
registration
requirement
of
16913,
that's
true.
that's
correct.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
--
and
--
and,
obviously,
that
--
that
makes
sense
in
terms
of
implementing
the
scheme,
that
if
somebody
registers
beforehand,
it
makes
it
much
easier
to
catch
them
once
they
move
afterwards.
