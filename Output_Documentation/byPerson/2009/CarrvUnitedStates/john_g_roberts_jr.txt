chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1301,
carr
v.
united
states.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
--
that's
pretty
unusual,
isn't
it,
to
have
congress
say
it's
up
to
the
attorney
general
whether
their
laws
apply
prospectively
or
retroactively
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
--
mr.
carr,
was
in
violation
of
the
law
the
instant
it
was
passed,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
--
an
obvious
question.
what's
the
government's
view
on
what
a
reasonable
time
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
but
the
reasonable
time
question
doesn't
come
up
in
your
--
in
your
hypothetical.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
first
because
he's
in
the
hospital
and
he
has
got
a
defense
there,
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
no
--
but
as
far
as
a
reasonable
time
goes,
nobody's
literally
incapable
of
doing
it
the
same
day
the
law
passed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
unless
they
meet
one
of
the
other
exceptions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
do
you
do
with
mr.
rothfeld's
hypothetical
about
someone
who
travels
in
interstate
commerce
as
a
young
child
and,
20
years
later,
is
covered
by
sorna?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
--
i'm
missing
your
answer
to
my
question.
the
answer
to
the
child
traveling
and
then
20
years
later
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
because
it's
--
you
have
to
require
under
sorna
before
the
travel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
is
that
you
don't
get
it
from
the
language?
you
get
it
from
the
anomaly;
you
get
it
from
the
purpose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
tried
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
tried
to
find
one
and
--
and
couldn't.
i
mean,
looking
up
travels
in
--
in
the
code,
and
in
each
of
those
cases
that
i
found
it's
always
--
it
looks
like
it's
--
it's
linked
directly
to
the
activity
that's
meant
to
be
covered,
you
know,
traveling
for
the
purpose
of
the
--
the
activity
that's
against
the
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
you
don't
have
to
--
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
i
guess
my
problem
with
your
argument
--
you
say,
"is
required
to
register
under
sorna.
"
but
you
can
be
required
to
register
under
sorna
before
sorna
is
enacted
to
the
extent
that
sorna
is
retroactive.
you
ask
someone:
why
are
you
registering?
well,
sorna
tells
me
i
--
i
have
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-1301,
carr
versus
united
states.
