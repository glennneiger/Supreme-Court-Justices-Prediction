justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
the
basic
purpose
of
this
statute?
i'm
having
a
hard
time
with
it.
is
it
--
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
try
to
get
a
lot
of
people
to
register
who
haven't
registered
at
all?
or
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
get
the
people
who
had
registered
in
one
state
and
then
moved,
and
make
sure
they
register
in
another
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean,
if
they
are
just
trying
to
get
people
to
register
in
general,
and
they
are
not
particularly
worried
about
travel,
then
they
are
using
this
travel
as
a
kind
of
jurisdictional
hook.
and
if
they
are
using
it
as
a
jurisdictional
hook,
they'd
like
to
get
everybody,
as
many
as
possible.
that
argues
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
just
what
they're
aiming
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
basically,
at
the
time
they
passed
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--most
states
didn't
require
registration.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
say
this
at
the
moment
--
you
may
not
know,
but
i
think
it
would
be
helpful.
at
the
time
this
was
passed,
would
you
say
almost
all
states
had
some
kind
of
registration
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
thinking
of
that
--
thinking
of
that
set
of
registration
acts
in
virtually
every
state,
did
most
of
those
or
none
of
them
or
a
few
of
them
or
how
many
made
it
required
that
a
person
register
who
had
committed
a
crime,
a
sex
crime,
in
a
different
state
and
had
moved
to
that
state?
most,
all
of
them,
none
of
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
universally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
--
so,
therefore,
every
person
who
has
committed
a
sex
offense,
or
almost
everyone,
would
have
been
subject
to
a
requirement
to
move
when
he
committed
the
offense
and
would
have
been
subject
to
a
requirement
to
register
when
he
moved
under
some
law.
now,
congress's
purpose
then
must
have
been
just
to
try
to
get
uniformity
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
going
back
to
the
purpose?
there's
a
section
on
page
26
of
the
house
report
where
they
go
in
some
length
to
saying
that
the
purpose
is
this
is
going
to
help
with
100,000
missing
people.
don't
worry;
if
you
can't
remember,
it
doesn't
matter.
what
they
say
is
there
are
100,000
missing.
what
they
do
is
they
travel,
let's
say,
from
alabama
to
california
and
they
don't
register.
now,
this
statute
is
going
to
help
with
that.
well,
how
does
it
help
with
that?
they
are
already
supposed
to
register
in
california.
and
i
thought,
well,
maybe
the
way
it
helps
with
that
is
that
it
imposes
some
new
information
requirements,
so
that
alabama,
if
it
were
complying,
would
now
have
a
lot
of
information
about
the
sex
offender,
and
it
would
have
an
obligation
--
it
could
more
easily
track
him
down,
or
at
least
california
could
or
somebody
could
more
easily
track
him
down,
because
he
has
to
give
information
to
alabama,
and
alabama
has
a
registry
up.
is
there
something
like
that
in
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's
--
that's
true
of
everybody
whether
they
have
moved
or
not
moved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is,
what
i'm
--
the
reason
i
brought
up
the
other
is
because
if
this
is
just
a
jurisdictional
hook,
i
can
see
why
congress
might
be
trying
to
get
as
many
people
as
they
want
to
register.
but
this
--
this
also
serves
some
purpose,
like
we're
going
to
make
alabama
get
some
information,
makes
it
easier
to
catch
these
people,
that
purpose
wouldn't
be
served
when
the
travel
takes
place
before
this
takes
effect
because
alabama
wouldn't
have
kept
the
information
then.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
congress
passes
this
statute.
and
how
does
it
help
specifically
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
the
person
who
hasn't
registered
in
california--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he's
afraid
of
the
feds.
he
didn't
--
he
wasn't
afraid
of
the
california
police,
but
he's
afraid
of
the
feds.
okay.
i've
got
it.
i've
got
that.
any
other
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
as
far
as
i
can
read
that
page,
it
seemed
to
me,
insofar
as
what
you've
just
said
is
true,
that
would
happen
only
after
this
statute
is
passed.
and,
therefore,
the
fact
that
he
had
moved
before
the
statute
is
passed
would
not
trigger
the
cooperation.
it
might
trigger
the
fed
prosecution
part,
but
it
wouldn't
trigger
the
cooperation
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
reason
i
bring
it
up
is
if
this
is
a
very
close
case.
that
tends
to
cut
somewhat
against
you;
namely,
that
the
thing
applies
full-force
in
terms
of
its
purposes
to
people
who
travel
after,
but
it
only
applies
as
sort
of
this
weak
thing
to
people
who
travel
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
been
able
to
find
--
when
in
doubt
about
the
purpose,
let's
turn
to
the
language.
is
it
the
case
that
you
found
any
other
statute,
any
other
statute,
where
congress
phrased
a
jurisdictional
hook
in
the
present
tense?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
find
anywhere
where
they're
both
phrased
in
present
tense
and
it
was
pretty
clear
that
congress
intended
to
catch
activity
that
was
--
at
least
where
the
jurisdictional
part
took
place
before
the
statute
took
effect?
you
find
that
good
an
analogy
anywhere?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
last
one.
it
should
help
with
a
minor
point.
but
--
but
i
take
it,
under
the
statute,
you
have
to
register
if
you
are
a
sex
offender.
and
that's
true
whether
you've
moved
or
not
moved?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
a
crime
--
it's
a
crime
under
the
section
we're
talking
about
only
if
you
are
both
the
person
who
had
to
register
and
you
didn't
and
you
moved?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everybody
in
the
state
has
to
register
if
they
meet
that
definition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
moved
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't.
he
said,
first
the
crime
has
to
take
place,
before
the
travel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
moreover,
there's
a
statutory
limitation,
because
after
a
certain
period
of
years,
you
don't
have
to
register
anymore.
so
the
hypotheticals
about
the
infant
and
20
years
ago
are
out,
because
the
longest
it
could
last
is
15
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
you
wouldn't
have
committed
the
crime
as
an
infant,
so
there
we
are.
but
it's
still
a
long
time,
15
years,
i
grant
you.
