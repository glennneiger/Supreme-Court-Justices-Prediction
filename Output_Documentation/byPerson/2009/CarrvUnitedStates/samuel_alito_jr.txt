justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
rothfeld,
i
wondered
if
i
could
ask
you
about
three
interrelated
points
concerning
your
textual
argument.
and
if
i
could
just
lay
those
on
the
table
and
get
your
reaction
to
them,
i
would
appreciate
it.
the
first
is
that
it
appears
that
there
is
a
pretty
universally
accepted
modern
legislative
drafting
convention
that
statutes
should
be
phrased
in
the
present
tense.
the
senate
drafting
manual,
for
example,
says:
always
use
the
present
tense
unless
the
provision
addresses
only
the
past,
the
future,
or
a
sequence
of
events
that
requires
use
of
a
different
tense.
and
the
house
manual
is
to
the
same
effect.
the
second
is
that
when
the
section
that's
involved
here,
2250,
was
drafted,
the
drafters
didn't
know
whether
sorna
would
apply
to
pre-sorna
sex
offense
convictions.
that
was
left
up
to
the
attorney
general.
and
so
when
they
were
drafting
this,
they
had
--
it
was
natural,
perhaps,
for
them
not
to
make
a
special
provision
for
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
some
pre-sorna
conduct
involved.
if
the
attorney
general
had
determined
that
only
post-sorna
convictions
would
qualify,
then
only
--
then
the
only
travel
that
would
qualify
would
be
--
would
be
post-sorna
travel.
it
was
only
when
the
attorney
general
decided
that
pre-sorna
convictions
could
qualify
that
the
question
that's
presented
here
became
a
possibility.
and
the
third
is
that
once
the
attorney
general
decided
that
sorna
would
apply
to
pre-sorna
sex
offense
convictions,
that
necessarily
meant
that
conduct
constituting
a
--
a
sorna
--
constituting
a
qualifying
sex
offense
could
occur
in
the
past.
and
yet
there
are
at
least
four
provisions
of
sorna
that
refer
to
the
conduct
that
constitutes
a
sex
offense
and
uses
only
the
present
tense,
although
in
those
instances
it
seems
that
those
provisions
have
to
be
read
as
also
covering
past
conduct,
pre-sorna
conduct.
these
are
all
in
42
u.s.c.
16911,
which
is
reproduced
--
the
relevant
provisions
are
on
3a
to
3-6
of
the
government's
brief.
i'll
just
mention
a
couple
of
them
to
provide
a
flavor
for
this.
under
42
u.s.c.
section
16911(3)(c),
on
3a
of
the
government's
brief,
an
offense
may
qualify
as
a
tier
ii
offense
if,
among
other
things,
it,
quote,
"occurs
after
the
offender
becomes
a
tier
i
sex
offender.
"
but
there
"occurs"
and
"becomes"
have
to
be
read
as
applying
to
past
conduct.
42
u.s.c.
1691(4)
on
the
same
page
says
that
an
offense
may
qualify
as
a
tier
iii
offense
if,
among
other
things,
it
involves
a
kidnapping
of
a
minor.
but
"involves"
there
has
to
mean
also
"involved".
and
the
other
two
are
subsection
(7)
on
5a
and
subsection
(8)
on
6a.
so
i
wondered
if
you
could
comment
on
that.
maybe
you
have
a
reaction
to
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
that
the
sequence
argument
that
the
government
was
making
was
that
the
events
have
to
occur
in
this
sequence:
the
conviction,
the
interstate
travel,
and
the
failure
to
register.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
might
be
wrong
on
that.
and
i
understood
that
you
agreed
that
the
interstate
travel
has
to
take
effect
--
has
to
occur
after
the
sex
offense
conviction.
it
wouldn't
--
you
couldn't
violate
--
you
wouldn't
violate
sorna
if
there's
interstate
travel,
then
the
conviction,
and
then
the
failure
to
register.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
but
they
might
be
wrong
that
the
sequence
--
that
the
way
these
set
out
--
are
set
out
in
the
statute
dictates
a
temporal
sequence--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
you
can
argue
that
the
temporal
sequence
that's
necessary
--
conviction,
travel,
failure
to
register
--
follows
from
the
purpose
of
this
provision,
which
is
to
catch
people
who,
after
having
committing
a
sex
offense
and
being
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
in
state
a,
move
to
state
b.
it
would
follow
from
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
not
necessarily
from
the
sequence
of
subsections
in
this
provision.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
makes
--
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
but
you
can
get
that
from
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
rather
than
from
the
sequence
in
which
these
elements
are
listed.
is
it
--
is
it
usually
the
case
in
a
criminal
statute
that
sets
out
a
number
of
element
that
they
have
to
be
satisfied
in
some
kind
of
temporal
sequence?
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
compare
two
cases.
we
have
this
case,
where
you
have
conviction,
interstate
travel,
sorna
takes
effect,
failure
to
register.
we
change
that.
that's
case
a.
case
b
is
just
like
this
case
except
the
sequence
is
different.
you
have
conviction,
sorna
takes
effect,
interstate
travel,
failure
to
register.
now,
why
would
congress
have
treated
those
two
situations
differently?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
the
concern
that
the
state
of
conviction
knows
that
an
individual
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
has
been
released
from
custody
and,
if
that
person
is
a
resident
of
the
state,
presumably
knows
that
the
person
is
likely
to
still
be
in
the
state,
but
if
the
person
moves
to
another
state,
the
state
to
which
the
person
moves
doesn't
know
that
a
sex
offender
has
moved
into
the
state,
and
that's
the
reason
for
the
federal
law
that
imposes
a
penalty
for
failing
to
register
in
the
new
state
after
having
traveled
across
interstate
lines?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
happen
to
know
what
indiana
law
provided
at
the
time?
within
what
period
of
time
after
moving
to
indiana
was
the
respondent
required
to
--
rather,
the
petitioner
required
to
register?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
should
the
reasonable
time
--
should
the
period
under
sorna,
which
isn't
specified
by
statute,
be
the
same
as
the
period
under
the
law
of
the
state
into
which
the
person
moves?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
all
of
those
provisions
refer
now
--
as
a
result
of
the
attorney
general's
determination
that
pre-sorna
convictions
qualify,
all
of
those
provisions
use
the
present
tense
to
refer
to
activities
that
can
have
taken
place
in
the
past.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
very
--
this
very
statute.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
your
main
argument
is
that
"travels"
is
in
the
present
tense,
and
that
means
present
and
future.
but
there
are
provisions
of
this
very
statute
that
use
the
present
tense
to
refer
to
past
conduct.
so
why
doesn't
that
knock
the
legs
out
from
under
your
textual
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.
gannon
may
have
made
an
argument
that's
not
helpful
to
his
position,
but
you
can
accept
that
the
first
provision
means
exactly
what
it
says:
"is
required
to
register".
and
that
takes
effect
on
day
when
sorna
is
enacted.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that
those
three
events
have
to
take
place
in
--
in
a
temporal
sequence.
it
doesn't
say
"is
required
to
register
and
thereafter
travels
in
interstate
commerce.
"
it
doesn't
say
that.
in
fact,
an
earlier
version
did
say
that,
and
it
was
taken
out,
wasn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
doesn't
if
that
results
from
the
aim
of
the
statute,
rather
than
the
order
in
which
those
elements
are
set
out
in
the
statute.
