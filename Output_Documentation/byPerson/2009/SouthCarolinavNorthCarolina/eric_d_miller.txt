mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
order
to
intervene
in
an
original
action
in
this
court,
a
citizen
of
a
state
that
is
a
party
to
the
action
must
show
a
compelling
interest,
separate
from
that
of
other
citizens,
that
is
not
properly
represented
by
the
state.
in
an
equitable
apportionment
action,
the
interest
that
is
at
stake
is
not
a
private
property
interest
in
water.
rather,
it
is
the
sovereign
interest
of
a
state
in
a
particular
share
of
the
waters
of
an
interstate
river.
for
that
reason,
a
private
interest
in
water
is
not
an
appropriate
basis
for
intervention
in
such
a
proceeding.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
think
that
the
interest
that
the
private
party
has
is
a
state
law
property
interest
in
water,
and
that's
an
interest
that
simply
isn't
at
stake
in
an
equitable
apportionment
action.
the
only
thing
that
this
court
is
deciding
is
what
share
of
the
river
does
each
state
get.
the
court
in
an
equitable
apportionment
action
does
not
decide
the
purely
intrastate
question
of
how
will
that
share
be
allocated.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
that
--
i
mean,
in
new
jersey
v.
new
york,
philadelphia,
which
sought
to
intervene
in
that
case,
constituted
a
majority
of
the
water
users
within
the
state
of
philadelphia.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
don't
recall
what
the
special
master--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--said
in
that
case.
but
this
court
has
held
in,
for
example,
colorado
v.
new
mexico,
that
even
on
purely
factual
questions,
the
special
master
is
--
who
makes
recommendations,
and
those
recommendations
are
reviewed
by
this
court
de
novo.
the
court
is
not
sitting
in
an
appellate
capacity.
this
is
a
case
within
its
original
jurisdiction,
and
this
court
has
an
independent
responsibility
to
make
a
determination,
even
on
factual
questions
and
a
fortiori
on
questions
of
intervention.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
right.
and
to
the
extent--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
to
the
--
i
mean,
to
the
extent
that
they
have
valuable
information
to
provide,
third-party
discovery
can
take
account
of
that,
as
can
amicus
participation.
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
for
parties
that
have
information
or
a
special
perspective
on
the
case
to
present
an
amicus
submission
to
the
special
master
or
to
this
court.
and
it's
--
but
that
--
that's
not
a
basis
for
allowing
them
to
become
full
parties
through
intervention.
and
then,
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
concern
about
the
management
of
this
case,
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
rule
recommended
by
the
special
master
and
the
rule
that
the
would-be
intervenors
are
urging
this
court
to
adopt
would,
of
course,
apply
not
just
in
this
litigation,
but
in
every
equitable
apportionment
action.
and
not
only
does
it
make
the
litigation
of
those
actions
much
more
difficult
to
have
additional
non-state
parties
in,
but
it
makes
it
much
more
difficult
for
those
cases
to
be
settled.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
--
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
that
i
don't
think
that,
either
in
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
in
this
case
or
in
the
submissions
of
the
--
the
would-be
intervenors,
that
there's
really
any
logical
limiting
principle
that
would
not
allow,
as
a
matter
of
routine,
large
water
users
to
come
in
to
equitable
apportionment
actions.
and
that's
inappropriate
for
the
more
fundamental
reason
that
these
original
actions
in
this
court
are
not
ordinary
cases.
this
court
has
said
that
sitting
in
judgment
between
two
sovereigns
is
one
of
the
most
grave
--
grave
and
delicate
responsibilities
the
court
has,
and
it's
a
sparingly
exercised
jurisdiction
reserved
for
the
most
serious
of
issues,
issues
of
such
importance
that,
if
the
states
were
independent
countries,
would
be
resolved
through
treaties
or--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
and
when
a
state
brings
such
an
action
or
seeks
to
bring
such
an
action,
it
can't
simply
file
a
complaint
as
of
right.
it
has
to
seek
this
court's
permission
to
file
the
complaint.
and
this
court
can
review
the
complaint
at
that
time
and
look
at
who
the
parties
are
and
figure
out
whether
it's
an
appropriate
case
for
the
exercise
of
this
court's
jurisdiction.
and
that,
in
our
view,
is
a
much
more
appropriate
way
to
proceed,
making
that
determination
at
the
outset
on
the
basis
of
the
state's
complaint,
rather
than
through
piecemeal
litigation
as
different
non-state
parties--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
where
they
were
seeking
to
intervene
on
north
carolina's
side
as
defendants.
that's
right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
under
section
27
of
the
federal
power
act,
which
is
16
u.s.c.
821,
the
power
act
does
not
affect
state
law
water
rights.
so
state
law
water
rights
are
taken
as
a
given,
and
it's
up
to
the
licensee
to
have
the
necessary
state
water
rights,
and
a
ferc
license
does
not
in
any
way
alter
the
distribution
of
state
law
property
rights
in
water.
and
what
the
commission
has
said
in
this
case
in
the
final
environmental
impact
statement
with
respect
to
duke's
relicensing
application,
which
is
available
on
the
commission
web
site,
it
cited
section
27
and
it
said:
"any
license
that
is
issued
will
not
impose
requirements,
including
minimum
flows,
that
infringe
on
water
rights
or
apportionments.
"
so
the
commission
is
aware
of
the
pendency
of
this
case.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
the
--
the
nature
of
this
proceeding
makes
that
outcome
not
--
not
something
that
would
happen
even
if
south
carolina
were
to
prevail,
because
what
south
carolina
is
seeking
is
to
get
more
water
flowing
downstream
to
it,
and
so
the
--
the
licensing
conditions,
which
generally
impose
minimum
flow
requirements
at
each
of
the
various
dams
operated
by
duke,
would
be
easier
to
satisfy,
not
harder
to
satisfy,
if
south
carolina
were
--
had
an
entitlement
to
get
even
more
water
flowing
through--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
duke
--
duke's
dams
--
the
licensing
condition
is
that
each
dam
allow
a
certain
amount
of
water
to
flow
through,
under
the
current
license
that
they
are
operating
under,
and
there
are
different
minimum
flow
requirements
under
the
renewal
license
that
is
being
sought.
but
an
order
in
effect
requiring
that
they
let
more
water
flow
through
would
not
be
in
conflict
with
the
licensing
requirement,
but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean,
i--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
they
--
i
mean,
one
possibility
is,
of
course,
that
duke
is
--
in
addition
to
obviously
being
an
operator
of
dams,
duke
is
a
very
large
consumer
of
water.
in
fact,
it's
the
largest
consumer
of
water
on
the
catawba
system
because
of
its
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
which
use
water
evaporatively
for
cooling
of
the
power
plants.
so--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
--
it
may
have
some
effect
on
its
ability
to
--
to
generate
power.
but
that
makes
it
a
large
industrial
user
of
water,
akin
to
those
that
the
court
referred
to
in
new
jersey
v.
new
york,
which
were
not
entitled
to
intervene.
i
would
also
point
out
in
further
response,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
your
question,
that
duke
is
a
north
carolina
corporation,
which
may
be
why
it's
seeking
to
come
in
on
the
north
carolina
side
of
this
case.
but
i
--
i
want
to
return
to
the
idea
that
these
kinds
of
cases
are
not
ordinary
cases.
they
involve
sovereign
interests,
and
i
think
what's
important
about
that
is
that
the
interest--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--as
i
said,
duke
is
an
operator
of
thermal
power
plants
that
are
large
consumers
of
water,
and
some
of
those
are
located
in
north
carolina.
