justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
we
--
we
had
a
case
involving,
what,
a
tax
on
--
on
oil
companies,
in
which
it
was
a
state
against
state
case,
but
we
allowed
the
oil
companies
who
would
pay
the
tax
to
intervene.
now,
why
is
that
any
different
from
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
these
--
these
are
rules
that
we
are
making
up
ourselves,
right,
as
to
when
we
are
going
to
allow
intervention
or
not?
do
--
is
there
any
case
--
i
think
there
isn't,
but
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
is
there
any
case
in
which
we
have
rejected
intervention
that
has
been
recommended
by
the
special
master?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
that
these
--
these
three
entities
are
the
principal
entities
that
are
guilty
of
interbasin
transfers,
which
is
essentially
what
the
--
what
the
dispute
is
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
focus
--
the
focus
of
the
complaint
is
upon
interbasin
transfers,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
and
these
three
entities
account
for
a
very
large
proportion
of
those
interbasin
transfers.
isn't
it
the
case
that
any
--
any
decision
by
--
by
this
court
on
--
on
this
question
will
necessarily
impact
directly
these
three
entities?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
real
world.
if
--
if
indeed
north
carolina
has
to
cut
back,
and
if
indeed
the
opinion
of
this
court
says
that
it's
taking
too
much
because
of
interbasin
transfers,
as
a
practical
matter
these
three
entities
are
going
to
be
out
of
luck.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but,
in
fact,
we've
never
rejected
a
special
master's
desire
to
--
to
have
intervenors
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
oil
case
that
i
mentioned.
i
forget
the
name
of
it.
the
tax--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
what
had
the
special
master
recommended
in
that
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we've
--
we've
allowed
private
parties
to
be
impleaded
by
the
states.
we
have
allowed
one
state
to
sue
another
state
and
a
private
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on,
i
suppose,
on
what
you
mean
by
"is
not
properly
represented
by
the
state.
"
if
you
think
the
state
does
not
have
a
sufficient
interest
to
defend
that
--
that
particular
right
vigorously,
might
that
not
be
--
might
not
that
qualify?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
could
say
that
realistically
when
you
are
talking
about
an
individual
water
user,
a
small
potatoes
water
user,
a
normal
resident
of
charlotte
perhaps.
but
when
you
are
talking
about
the
biggest
entities
that
are
going
to
be
affected
by
the
apportionment,
it
really
doesn't
ring
true
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
special
master
think
philadelphia
should
have
been
let
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer
is
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
we
haven't
--
we
haven't
been
sitting
there
trying
to
figure
out
what
would
facilitate
the
proceeding.
much
of
the
discovery
in
the
case
has
already
focused
on
these
three
entities,
hasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
to
say
that
they
are
just
--
you
know,
they
are
just
joe
dokes
is
--
is
really
very
unrealistic.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that
--
if
and
when
that
is
the
case,
the
special
master
will
not
want
them
to
come
in,
as
the
vast
majority
of
special
masters
have
not
wanted
them
to
come
in,
in
the
past.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
reserved
exclusively
to
state
--
to
suits
between
a
state
and
another
state.
we've
allowed
it
to
cover
suits
between
a
state
and
another
state
and
private
citizens
of
the
other
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
a
matter
of
infringing
on
water
rights
or
apportionments.
i
mean,
that
does
not
exclude,
it
seems
to
me,
the
revocation
of
the
license
or
the
denial
of
a
renewal
of
the
license
because
duke
power
does
not
have
enough
water.
that
wouldn't
preclude
that,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
that.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
may
also
mean
it
when
it
has
to
increase
the
outflow,
the
level
of
its
impoundments
reduces,
and
that
may
affect
its
ability
to
generate
power,
which
in
turn
may
--
may
affect
its
license.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
think
all
ferc
said
is
--
is
that
nothing
in
its
license
would
--
would
require
allocation
of
water
by
--
by
north
carolina.
and
that's
quite
different
from
whether
--
whether
a
severe
reduction
in
the
water
that
duke
can
use
would
--
would
affect
the
--
the
nature
of
the
license
given
by
ferc.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
it
automatic
then?
is
it
automatic
then?
or
is
it
just
that,
when
that
condition
is
met,
the
special
master
can
permit
the
intervention?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
also,
how
helpful
the
intervention
will
be
to
the
management
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
of
course,
the
special
master's
determination
of
that
is
not
final.
it's
ultimately
up
to
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
a
discretionary
intervention
you
are
arguing
for,
not
a
mandatory
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
same
--
the
same
test
applies
to
the
appropriateness
of
naming
a
private
party
defendant,
as
you
would
urge
for
intervention
by
a
private
party
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
--
in
deciding
what's
equitable
as
between
the
two
states,
i
guess
the
--
the
court,
ultimately,
and
the
special
master,
initially,
will
have
to
decide
what
uses
of
water
by
one
state
or
the
other
are
not
equitable
uses--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
go
beyond
what
is
reasonable.
so
i
don't
see
how
you
could
decide
the
case
without
deciding
whether
especially
particularly
massive
uses
are
appropriate
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
dead
losses
to
south
carolina.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
water
in
dispute.
if
the
main
gravamen
of
the
complaint
is
interbasin
transfers,
they
--
they
occupy
a
huge
proportion
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
--
did
the
decree
only
apply
to
taxing
these
particular
companies?
could
the
--
could
the
state
have
taxed
other
companies
after
the
decree
issued?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
yes
or
no?
i
--
you
say
yes,
it
would
have
general
applicability.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
affects
the
agreement
on
which
the
license
is
based.
the
license
was
based
upon
a
very
hard
negotiated
agreement
among
a
number
of
entities.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
duke
said
the
problem
is
not
the
united
states
--
so
much
the
united
states
granting
a
license.
it's
the
license
we
requested
was
based
upon
a
negotiated
agreement
among
a
number
of
entities,
and
that
agreement
goes
out
the
window
once
--
on
the
basis
of
this
lawsuit.
