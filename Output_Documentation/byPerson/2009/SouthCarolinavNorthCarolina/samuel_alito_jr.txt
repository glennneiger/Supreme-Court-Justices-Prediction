justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
an
original
action
concerning
the
catawba
river
and
the
matter
now
before
us
concern
south
carolina's
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
first
interim
report.
the
special
master
recommended
that
we
granted
motions
of
three
non-state
entities
to
intervene
in
this
action.
they
are
the
city
of
charlotte,
north
carolina
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
and
duke
energy
carolinas.
we
overrule
south
carolina's
exceptions
with
respect
to
the
catawba
river
water
supply
projects
and
duke
energy
carolinas
but
we
sustain
south
carolina's
exceptions
with
respect
to
the
city
of
charlotte.
we
apply
the
standard
for
intervention
by
non-state
entities
in
an
original
action
that
we
announced
nearly
60
years
ago
in
new
jersey
versus
new
york.
“an
intervener
whose
state
is
already
a
party
should
have
the
burden
of
showing
some
compelling
interest
in
his
own
right
apart
from
his
interest
in
a
class
with
all
other
citizens
and
creatures
of
the
state
which
interest
is
not
properly
represented
by
the
state.”
for
the
reasons
set
out
more
fully
in
our
opinion
we
find
that
the
catawba
river
water
supply
projects
and
duke
energy
carolinas
have
carried
this
burden
but
that
the
city
of
charlotte
has
not.
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
is
an
unusual
by
state
entity
that
supplies
water
to
consumers
in
both
states
is
jointly
operated
and
funded
by
authorities
in
both
states
and
is
not
properly
represented
by
either
state
in
this
litigation.
duke
energy
carolinas
operates
a
series
of
11
dams
on
the
catawba
river
in
both
states
and
in
accordance
with
the
terms
and
its
license
issued
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
controls
the
catawba
river’s
minimum
flow
into
south
carolina.
neither
state
properly
represents
these
interests.
like
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
the
city
of
charlotte
transfers
water
from
the
catawba
river
basin,
those
transfers
however
fall
solely
within
north
carolina's
equitable
share
of
the
river
and
north
carolina
properly
represents
the
city's
interests
in
this
litigation.
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
thomas,
ginsberg
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
