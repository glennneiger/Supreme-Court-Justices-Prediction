justice

bader

mr.
frederick,
if
this
were
an
ordinary
civil
case,
we
would
be
guided
by
the
rule
on
permissive
intervention,
and
appellate
courts
in
dealing
with
that
rule
give
a
healthy
measure
of
respect
to
the
trial
judge's
determination.
so
even
though
the
civil
rules
are
not
binding
in
original
jurisdiction
cases,
isn't
that
a
sound
approach
that
we
should
adopt?
just
as
a
court
of
appeals
would
defer
to
a
district
judge's
decision,
so
we
should
give
a
healthy
measure
of
deference
to
the
special
master's
evaluation
that
this
will
be
useful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
can
we
go
back
a
little?
i
think
you
just
said
there
was
no
special
master's
recommendation
in
maryland
v.
louisiana,
but
i'm
looking
at
page
745.
in
the
footnote
21,
it
said:
"the
master
recommended
that
we
grant
the
motion
of
17
pipeline
companies
to
intervene
as
plaintiffs.
"
and
then
it
says:
"it
is
not
unusual
to
permit
intervention
of
private
parties
in
original
actions.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
here
the
complaint
was
south
carolina's
complaint,
and
these
are
intervenors
on
north
carolina's
--
on
north
carolina's
side.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
representing
the
position
of
the
united
states,
would
you
address
the
ferc
license
that
duke
energy
is
raising?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
in
the
new
jersey
v.
new
york
decision,
the
dissenters
there
that
would
have
allowed
the
intervention
did
say
that
in
general
it
is
unwise
to
encumber
original
jurisdiction
cases
with
non-state
parties.
that
was
even
the
dissenters.
so
you
start
out
with
in
general
it's
not
wise
to
let
these
people
come
in.
and
following
up
on
the
chief's
question,
a
state
can't
be
sued
without
its
consent.
and
it's
true
here
that
south
carolina
is
initiating
the
action,
but
it's
initiating
the
action
against
a
sister
state.
the
special
master's
recommendation
would
require
the
state
to
have
as
its
direct
adversary
three
parties
who
are
not
a
sister
state,
and
that
kind
of
dilutes
the
notion
of
original
jurisdiction.
it's
a
controversy
between
two
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
because
the
state
chose
to
sue
it
as
a
party
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
intervenors
--
the
intervenors
are
users
of
the
water
from
the
river?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
--
because
they
use
a
lot
of
water.
and
my
question
is:
how
do
we
decide
once
we
say
--
beyond
the
special
master
can
let
these
people
in
with
party
status
--
what
users
can
come
in
where,
obviously,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
all
users
of
the
river
water
to
come
in,
so
which
ones
can
and
which
ones
can't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
go
back
to
the
question
of
couldn't
the
special
master
receive
the
information
she
wants
if
these
three
entities
come
in
as
amici?
coming
in
as
intervenors,
they
have
full
party
status.
they
can
engage
in
discovery.
they
can
protract
the
case.
they
can
appeal
any
adverse
judgment.
why
isn't
the
most
reasonable
accommodation
to
say,
well,
we
will
listen
to
you,
but
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
full
party
status?
