chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
138
in
our
original
docket,
south
carolina
v.
north
carolina.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
friends
agreed
that
the
new
jersey
v.
new
york
standard
applied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
your
basic
argument
that
each
state
should
represent
its
own
constituents.
but
isn't
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
in
a
different
category?
because
it
straddles
both
states,
and
i
think
it
can
reasonably
fear
that
it
would
be
treated
as
a
stepchild
by
both
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
guess
i
haven't
heard
yet
an
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
first
question
about
whether
there
was
a
recommendation
from
the
special
master
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
why
isn't
duke
power
--
why
isn't
duke
power
on
the
other
side,
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
have
smart
lawyers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bartolomucci.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
our
original
jurisdiction.
i
regard
the
special
master
as
more
akin
to
a
law
clerk
than
a
district
judge.
we
don't
defer
to
somebody
who's
an
aide
that
we
have
assigned
to
help
us
gather
things
here.
i
think
on
legal
questions
of
intervention
we
have
to
decide
de
novo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
let
me
tell
you
what
i'm
very
worried
about.
this
is
our
original
jurisdiction,
a
delicate
jurisdiction
that
allows
us
to
resolve
disputes
between
sovereign
states.
and
i
look
out
and
i
see
all
sorts
of
private
parties
intervening
in
a
way
that
would
give
them
party
status.
and
i
think
that's
compromising
what
our
original
jurisdiction
is
supposed
to
be
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
--
all
of
the
intervenors,
prospective
intervenors,
they
want
to
make
sure
north
carolina
doesn't
lose
water,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
their
--
well,
they
want
to
reduce
south
carolina's
claim
on
the
water.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
to
the
extent
they
have
differing
interests,
why
aren't
those
interests
fully
satisfied
by
amicus
participation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
shape
the
record,
but
intervention
status
would
give
you
the
right
to
appeal,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
and
appeal
the
normal
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
my
question.
if
we
grant
intervention
in
this
type
of
case
and
there
is
no
reason
it
would
be
three
--
i
mean,
in
the
next
case,
it
could
be
20
different
intervenors,
and
they
are
filing
exceptions
every
other
week
that
we
have
to
review
and
adjudicate
because
they
are
not
bound
by
whether
or
not
the
state
that
is
on
their
side
wants
to
file
exceptions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
north
carolina,
as
a
sovereign
state,
can
represent
the
interests
of
its
constituents
as
it
sees
fit.
you
and
your
fellow
prospective
intervenors
just
have
to
do
what
citizens
do
all
the
time,
which
is
convince
north
carolina,
one,
and
you
can
help
them,
to
get
as
much
water
as
they
can;
and,
two,
when
they
get
it
or
if
they
lose
it,
whatever
they
are
left
it,
to
give
it
to
you,
rather
than
the
other
parties.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
that's--
then
i
just
wonder
why
you
are
here
in
an
original
action.
what
you
are
saying
is
they
have
all
sorts
of
different
interests,
and
it
just
--
they
get
to
skip
district
court.
they
get
to
skip
the
court
of
appeals.
they
can
just
come
right
in
here,
as
if
they
were
a
state,
and
participate
in
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
what's
special
about
it?
i
mean,
let's
say
i
own
a
little
farm
on
the
banks
of
the
catawba,
and
i
take
water
out
to
--
so
the
cows
have
something
to
drink,
why
does
charlotte
get
a
special
status
just
because
they
take
a
lot?
i'm
affected
by
how
much
water
runs
through
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
that
relief
will
affect
how
much
water
is
available
for
me
to
draw
out
and
use
on
my
farm.
that's
a
compelling
interest.
i
--
you
know,
in
times
of
drought,
this
water
barely
trickles
by,
and,
if
it's
cut
back,
the
farm
is
going
to
go
down.
it
seems
to
me
that,
when
you
say
they
have
a
special
interest,
you
are
just
saying
they
have
got
a
big
interest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
say
the
interest
--
the
dispute
is
really
in
effect
between
company
abc
in
north
carolina
and
company
xyz
in
south
carolina.
i
mean,
do
we
--
we
would
not
accept
an
original
action
if
they
sued
each
other,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
let
them
just
use
the
states
as,
you
know,
a
fa√ßade
to
get
into
this
court
and
have
their
dispute
adjudicated
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wouldn't
it
--
would
it
be
surprising
if
the
special
master
recommended
that
all
the
issue
that
she
was
going
to
address
was
the
relative
equitable
apportionment
between
north
carolina
and
south
carolina,
and
even
though
south
carolina
wanted
an
injunction
directed
against
the
city
of
charlotte,
that's
up
to
north
carolina?
north
carolina
can
divvy
up
its
water
however
it
wants.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
browning.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maryland
v.
louisiana
involved
a
specific
tax
on
specific
companies,
and
they
were
allowed
to
intervene.
this
is
not
that.
this
is
a
question
of
how
the
equitable
apportionment
of
the
water
is
going
to
be,
and
north
carolina
can
do
with
the
water
whatever
it
will.
it
strikes
me
as
very
different
than
maryland
v.
louisiana.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
--
as
the
allocation
would
in
this
case,
presumably.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
my
basic
concern
is
that
--
and
i
will
let
you
finish
if
there
is
more
to
the
answer.
i'm
sorry.
private
parties
are
going
to
hijack
our
original
jurisdiction,
and
it
was
highlighted
for
me
when
i
read
your
motion,
the
motion
of
private
parties
for
divided
argument.
your
proposal
was
that
they
be
divided
10,
10,
and
10.
you
didn't
even
want
to
be
here.
as
they
view
the
case
and
as
you
view
the
case,
it's
got
so
little
to
do
with
the
state
that
the
state
didn't
even
want
to
come
here
and
argue
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
thought
their
participation
here
before
this
court
on
a
question
in
original
jurisdiction
was
more
important
than
yours,
and
you
represent
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
can't
you
represent
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
are
your
constituents.
you
are
the
state.
you
are
coming
here
directly,
not
even
going
to
district
court,
and
you
seem
to
be
ceding
your
sovereignty
over
to
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
what's
the
interest
of
north
carolina?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
standing
there
telling
me
why
duke
has
an
interest.
what's
north
carolina's
interest?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
oppose
their
intervention.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
an
attack
on
--
if
it's
an
attack
on
charlotte,
i
would
expect
the
state
to
be
standing
there
protecting
it
and
not
feel
that
they
can't
do
that
without
charlotte,
itself,
coming
into
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
2
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
138
on
the
original
dockets
south
carolina
versus
north
carolina.
