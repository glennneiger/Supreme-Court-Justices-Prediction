justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
don't
know
that
you've
actually
addressed
the
operative
question
of
what
amount
of
discretion,
if
any,
are
we
going
to
give
to
special
masters
to
determine
when
they
require
the
presence
of
a
party
to
do
equity,
which
is
what
i
read
the
special
master
to
be
suggesting.
these
are
the
three
biggest
users
of
water,
at
least
one
of
them
straddles
both
states,
another
has
a
potential
license.
and
so
that
each
of
them
has
a
different
situation
than
a
normal
water
user.
so,
you're
--
all
you're
begging
is
the
question
of
whether
we
just
say
you
can't.
but
why
is
the
"you
can't"
compelled,
either
by
our
case
law
or
by
any
original
jurisdiction
principle?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
happens
to
north
carolina
if
it
has
less
water?
what
does
it
do
with
respect
to
duke?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
tell
me
what
she
said
that
makes
them
helpful.
what
can
they
provide
that
couldn't
be
done
by
merely
an
amici
submission?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
your
adversary
has
just
said
none,
according
to
the
terms
of
the
license
and
what
the
ferc
has
said.
so
why
is
--
why
don't
we
just
take
what
ferc
has
said--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--at
face
value?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
does
that
get
us
to
avoid
involvement
in
interstate
--
intrastate
disputes
over
water
use?
that
just
drags
us
right
into
your
problems
among
your
water
users.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
advocating
a
rule
that
says,
almost,
you
have
a
right
to
intervene
because
you
have
an
interest
that
won't
be
adequately
represented.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
your
position?
then
what
happens
to
the
special
master
who
says,
no,
i
don't
want
all
you
guys
here?
how
do
we
say
that
that
master
abused
his
or
her
discretion
by
saying
no?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
see
the
issue
before
us
as
being
was
she
right
or
wrong,
even
though
nevada
said
--
i'm
sorry
--
that
north
carolina
said
that
it
was
going
to
adequately
represent
each
of
these
interests,
but
that
just
wasn't
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
north
carolina
is
not
telling
us
the
truth?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are
going
to
defend
all
of
their
interests
as
it
affects
north
carolina,
right?
you
are
not
incapable
of
protecting
their
north
carolina
interests.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
it
your
interest
to
--
to
resist
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
your
interest
is
to
defend
the
cra,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
in
your
interest
not
to
support
the
cra?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
would
like
--
you
would
like,
in
this
litigation
against
the
two
states,
for
the
special
master
to
undo
the
--
your
obligations
under
the
cra?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
prepared
to
tell
us
right
now
--
this
is
what
you
are
saying
to
us:
we
will
not
represent
the
interest
of
duke?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
prepared
to
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
your
city?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
to
your
--
and
to
the
crwsp?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--are
you
prepared
to
say
that
you
are
not
adequately
defending
the
interest
of
the
crwsp?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
you
said,
with
duke,
that
you
won't
support--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--them.
are
you
not
going
to
support
this
--
the
joint
venture
in
property?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me,
are
you
seeking
injunctive
relief
out
of
any
of
the
three
intervenors?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
willing
to
concede
that
if
whatever
you
ask
for
here
affects
that
license,
once
its
issued,
that
then
duke's
intervention
is
proper?
