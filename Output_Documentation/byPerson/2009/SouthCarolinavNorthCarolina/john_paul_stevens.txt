mr.
miller,
if
i
--
if
i
understood
your
argument,
you
are
saying
that
duke's
interests
are
really
with
south
carolina,
or
--
to
increase
the
flow.
but
i
would
think
then
it
would
be
north
carolina
who
would
be
objecting
to
their
participation
in
the
case
rather
than
south
carolina.
and
they
don't.
they
--
they
welcomed
them
in,
as
i
remember
the
papers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question:
in
what
respect
does
the
relief
sought
against
the
city
differ
from
the
relief
sought
against
the
state?
