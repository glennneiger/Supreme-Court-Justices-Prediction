mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
south
carolina
seeks
an
equitable
apportionment
with
north
carolina
of
the
catawba
river.
both
states
act
as
parens
patriae
on
behalf
of
all
users
of
the
river
within
their
boundaries.
for
three
reasons,
this
court
should
not
adopt
the
special
master's
recommendation
that
charlotte,
duke,
and
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
be
permitted
to
intervene
as
parties
in
this
original
action:
first,
the
report
articulates
the
wrong
legal
test
for
intervention.
second,
under
the
new
jersey
v.
new
york
standard,
none
of
the
three
entities
should
be
permitted
to
intervene.
and,
third,
the
report's
approach
to
intervention
involves
this
court
in
deciding
intramural
disputes
between
and
among
water
users
in
one
state.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
the
special
master
applied
the
wrong
factors,
we
would
submit,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
party
or
an
intervenor
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
as
a
party.
the
special
master
sought
to
distill
from
this
court's
cases
three
principles
that
we
would
submit
are
not
the
appropriate
principles
in
deciding
an
intervenor's
status.
first,
the
report
overemphasizes
the,
quote,
"direct
stake",
although
the
master
found
that
the
equitable
apportionment
had
no
specific
impact
on
individual
users
of
the
water.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
your
honor,
part
of
what
you
will
be
deciding
in
this
case
is
the
appropriate
standard
for
intervention,
and
the
special
master,
we
respectfully
submit,
did
not
apply
the
new
jersey
v.
new
york
factors.
instead,
the
report
distilled
from
other
cases,
not
the
new
jersey
v.
new
york
case,
the
principles
that
she
thought
should
apply
to
govern
an
intervenor's
status,
and
those
three
principles,
we
would
submit,
are
incorrect.
under
the
new
jersey
v.
new
york
standard,
the
master
did
not
make
findings
that
would
be
appropriate
to
determine
the
intervenor
status
here
as
appropriate
parties.
there
was
no
finding
of
inadequate
representation
by
either
state
to
support
any
of
the
intervenor's
request
to
participate
as
parties.
there
was
no
finding
of
a
compelling
interest
in
the
sense
that
it
was
truly
compelling.
it's
hard
to
argue
in
cases
in
--
where
there
is
no
case
from
this
court
in
the
equitable
apportionment
area
that
three
intervenors
would
have
met
the
compelling
interest
standard
here.
and,
finally,
the
new
york-new
jersey
standard
talks
about
having
interests
that
are
apart
from
other
interests.
but
both
charlotte
and
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
are
simply
acting
on
behalf
of
all
users
of
north
carolina
water.
they
simply
happen
to
be
the
largest
ones.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
first,
the
interests
were
different.
they
were
not
an
equitable
apportionment
where
the
water--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--this
court
has
said
for
200
years
that
water
is
a
unique
resource
within
the
sovereign
control
of
states.
in
the
maryland
case,
the
court
permitted
intervention
in
a
situation
in
which
louisiana
had
sued
the
pipeline
companies
in
louisiana
state
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
its
tax
was
constitutional.
there
was
also
a
pending
ferc
action
in
federal
court
in
louisiana
raising
the
same
issue,
so
when
maryland
and
eight
other
states
who
were
not
parens
patriae
of
the
various
pipeline
companies
who
sought
to
intervene
filed
the
original
action,
i
think
the
court
appropriately
considered
that
interests
of
judicial
efficiency
called
for
handling
the
commerce
clause
challenge
in
the
original
action
in
this
case.
and
finally,
the
court
only
devoted
two
sentences
of
its
opinion
and
didn't
cite
the
new
jersey
v.
--
new
york
v.
new
jersey
case
in
acting
on
the
intervention.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
i
can
recall
a
case
in
that
factual
scenario,
but
i
can
point
you
to
kentucky
v.
indiana
in
1930,
in
which
this
court
rejected
kentucky's
attempt
to
join
individual
indiana
citizens
as
parties
in
an
original
action
over
indiana's
alleged
breach
of
a
contract
to
build
an
interstate
bridge.
and
the
reason--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
submit
they
have
the
weakest
claim
to
intervention
in
this
case.
their
argument,
fundamentally,
is
that
union
county,
north
carolina,
which
is
the
north
carolina
part
of
the
joint
venture
with
the
lancaster
water
district,
should
be
permitted
to
have
water
purchased
from
the
south
carolina
side
of
the
boundary.
so
what's
happening
with
that
water
project
is
the
water
is
sucked
out
on
the
south
carolina
side
and
piped
north
for
union
county's
consumption
under
a
union
county
permit
with
the
state
of
north
carolina.
union
county,
therefore,
is
acting
as
any
other
user
of
water,
along
with
charlotte
and
all
other
users
of
water
in
north
carolina.
the
catawba
project
is
not
here
to
intervene
to
protect
its
interests
on
the
south
carolina
side
of
the
boundary.
those
are
adequately
protected,
we
submit,
by
the
attorney
general
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state.
so
in
effect
the
union
county,
north
carolina,
claim
here
of
5
million
gallons
of
water
per
day
which
they
are
seeking
to
protect
through
their
intervention
is
no
different
than
the
other
interests
of
north
carolina
water
users
that
they
are
seeking
to
protect--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
dispute
is
about
the
transfer
of
water
and
consumption
of
water
in
toto.
the
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
focus
of
the
complaint
highlights
interbasin
transfers
to
the
extent
that
they
are
a
large
quantifiable
amount
of
water
being
taken
out
of
the
catawba
river,
that
we
submit
should
not
be
counted
on--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
in
an
equitable
apportionment
case,
this
court
decides
which
share
of
the
water
is
allocable
to
each
state.
it
is
a
question
of
state
law
how
each
state
shall
determine
the
intrastate
allocations
of
the
water.
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
take
the
real
world,
your
honor,
as
this
court's
cases
direct
us,
and
those
cases
tell
us
that
in
situations
where
the
court
is
deciding
an
equitable
apportionment
between
two
states
--
water,
of
course,
is
fungible.
it's
a
series
of
molecules
that
do
not
accord
property
rights
in
any
one
entity
or
user.
they
all
divine
from
the
state
itself.
so
if
north
carolina,
in
its
exercise
of
parens
patriae
responsibility,
determines
that
charlotte
should
have
a
larger
share
than
what
it
currently
has,
that's
a
decision
for
charlotte
--
for
north
carolina
as
a
political
entity
to
decide
among
its
users.
it
does
not
necessarily
implicate
this
court's
action
in
an
equitable
apportionment
to
say
that
what
the
court
will
ultimately
decide
is
what
charlotte's
share
is.
that
is
not
what
we
are
seeking,
and
that's
not
what
an
injunction
from
this
court
equitably
apportioning
the
catawba
river
would
necessarily
decide.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
for
several
reasons,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
in
any
appellate
review
situation,
this
court
would
review
de
novo
the
legal
test
that
would
be
applied.
our
initial
submission
is
the
master
applied
and
articulated
the
wrong
legal
test.
so
you
would
first
need
to
determine,
we
would
submit,
what
is
the
correct
legal
test
for
submission.
that
is
a
de
novo
review
standard.
but
secondly,
the
court
has
said
in
numerous
original
cases
it
does
not
apply
deference,
although
it
gives
appropriate
respect
to
special
masters,
and
so
there
would
be
no
basis
for
applying
a
deference
standard
to
a
special
master
ruling
on
a
question
of
law
that
fundamentally
is
about
what
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
is
supposed
to
be
about.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
virtually
every
case,
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--maryland
v.
louisiana.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
was
actually
no
special
master
recommendation
in
that
case.
the
court
decided
it
on
its
motion
directly
to
this
court.
virtually
all
of
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
the
blue
brief
highlight
the
fact
that
special
masters
routinely
reject
motions
to
intervene.
it
is
the
rare
situation
in
which
a
special
master
would
allow
intervention.
and
the
only
example
that
the
other
side
can
come
up
with
is
the
nebraska
v.
wyoming
case,
in
which
finally
basin
electric,
after
10
years
of
participating
in
the
original
action
as
an
amicus,
was
allowed
to
intervene
because
the
special
master
viewed
there
to
be
tension
between
the
state
of
nebraska's
interest
and
that
that
basin
electric
was
seeking
to
vindicate.
you--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
the
case
that
it
cited
is
oklahoma
v.
texas,
which
is
a
very
unusual
case
from
this
court's
docket
in
the
1920s.
what
the
court
decided
in
1932,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
wyoming
and
colorado
case
was
that
in
situations
involving
interstate
allocations
of
water,
the
claimants
or
users
of
a
state
are
deemed
to
be
represented
by
the
state.
the
case
on
which
the
court
relied
in
the
maryland
case
was
back
into
an
old
era
in
which
it
was
unclear
whether
states
acting
as
parens
patriae
had
the
responsibility
to
act
on
behalf
of
all
claimants
or
users
of
water.
the
maryland
case,
as
i
said
before,
did
not
analyze
the
new
jersey
v.
new
york
factors,
and
i
would
submit
that
in
light
of
the
other
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
fact
that
it
was
a
commerce
clause
challenge
involving
federal,
state,
and
private
companies,
in
which
there
was
multiple
litigation
pending
in
various
forums,
it
was
an
exercise
of
the
court's
decision
to
efficiently
decide
the
commerce
clause
challenge
to
allow
those
pipeline
companies
in,
where
some
of
those
pipeline
companies
were
not
represented
by
states
that
were
parties
in
the
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
--
i
will
--
i
obviously
forgot
about
footnote
21
of
the
court's
opinion
in
maryland
v.
louisiana,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i
think--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
let's
start
with
the
original
jurisdiction
principle.
those
are
actions
that
are
brought
invoking
this
court's
original
jurisdiction,
which
this
court
could
sit
without
a
special
master
and
would
decide
the
matter
as
it
sits
as
a
court
of
nine.
the
fact
that
it
appoints
a
special
master
to
assist
and
facilitate
that
effort
does
not
imbue
the
actions
of
that
person
delegated
that
responsibility
with
something
akin
to
the
deference
given
to
district
judges
in
making
various
fact
findings.
secondly,
on
a
question
of
law,
as
intervention
fundamentally
is
--
and
ultimately
we
are
talking
about
the
scope
and
contours
of
this
court's
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
--
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
there
are
two
interests
that
are
ultimately
being
protected:
one
is
the
dignity
interest
of
the
state
acting
in
its
sovereign
capacity
on
a
subject,
water,
that
quintessentially
is
sovereign;
and
it
is
doing
so
for
judicial
efficiency
purposes,
because
it
allows
the
court
to
expect
each
state
to
represent
adequately
all
of
the
users
of
water
in
that
state.
so,
for
those
reasons,
we
think
that
a
special
master
recommendation
ought
to
be
reviewed
with
the
same
level
of
scrutiny
that
all
other
aspects
of
a
special
master's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not
in
an
equitable
apportionment.
and
--
and
i
think
the
--
the
scope
of
the
relief
is
important.
and
that
is
because
the
state
seeking
the
relief
is
assuming
the
risk
that
the
relief
that
it
wants
to
get
from
that
state
is
an
inadequate
form
of
relief.
here
the
form
of
relief
south
carolina
seeks
goes
only
against
north
carolina.
we
cannot
get
an
equitable
apportionment
with
charlotte
or
the
catawba
project.
we
can
only
get
it
from
north
carolina.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
might
be
affected,
but
only
in
an
ancillary
way.
it
is
an
--
part
of
an
application
to
the
ferc.
the
ferc
here
is
saying
it
does
not
affect
it
because
the
license
itself
will
not
dictate
minimum--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--neither
the
agreement
--
and
this
is
at
page
51
to
52
of
our
brief,
citing
39
of
the
cra
--
says
it
doesn't
affect
water
rights.
the
final
environmental
impact
statement
from
ferc
says
it
doesn't
affect
apportionment
interstate
issues.
both
ferc
and
the
cra
itself
disclaim
any
impact
on
the
equitable
apportionment
action
pending
here.
if
i
could
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
have
four
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
we
seek
an
injunction
enjoining
the
interbasin
transfer
statute
to
the
extent
it
exceeds
north
carolina's
equitable
apportionment.
we
are
here
to
get
our
fair
share
of
the
river
vis-à-vis
north
carolina.
and
duke's
cra
application
expressly
disclaims
any
--
any
ability
to
go
into
the
interbasin
transfer.
that's
at
page
20,
footnote
14,
of
our
motion
for
leave
to
file
exceptions.
the
ferc
has
said
it
will
not
affect,
in
giving
its
license,
the
equitable
apportionment
action
now
pending
before
you.
in
duke's
cra,
at
paragraph
39.9,
it
says
it
does
not
affect
state
water
uses.
so
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
those
expressed
disclaimers
should
be
given
effect
when
south
carolina
is
simply
seeking
to
determine,
as
between
the
two
states,
the
rights.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
license
hasn't
been
issued,
justice
scalia.
it's
still
pending.
and
that's
what
ferc
has
before
it,
and
ferc
has
said
that
the
cra
will
not
affect
what
license
is
issued,
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
a
fundamental--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
because
the
united
states
can
enter
--
can
affect
the
interests
and
represent
the
interests
of
its
licensees.
duke's
interest
is
completely
derivative
of
the
united
states'
power
to
confer
a
license
on
an
energy
producer.
and
the
united
states
here
is
saying,
no,
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
intervene.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
agreement
is
a
private
contract
among
various
water
users,
and
it
is
no
different
than
the
fact
that
all
users
of
this
river
will
be
affected,
one
way
or
the
other,
by
whatever
decree
this
court
issues,
whether
they
are
on
the
south
carolina
side
or
the
north
carolina
side.
