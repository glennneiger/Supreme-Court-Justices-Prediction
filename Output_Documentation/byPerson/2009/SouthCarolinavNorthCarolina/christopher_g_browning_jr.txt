mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
turn
to
two
questions
that
justice
scalia
asked
mr.
frederick,
but
i
think
his
response
needs
clarification
from
north
carolina's
perspective.
the
first
question
dealt
with
maryland
v.
louisiana,
and
mr.
frederick
responded
that
that
case,
in
which
17
pipeline
companies
were
permitted
to
intervene
--
according
to
mr.
frederick,
the
states
in
that
case
did
not
serve
as
parens
patriae
with
regard
to
those
17
pipeline
companies.
that
is
factually
incorrect.
in
that
case,
two
of
those
pipeline
companies
--
the
michigan-wisconsin
pipeline
company
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
michigan,
one
of
the
complaining
states
in
that
case,
as
well
as
the
national
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
was
an
illinois
corporation.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
in
maryland
v.
louisiana,
that
was
a
taxation
case,
a
case
that
goes
to
a
fundamental
interest
of
the
states,
the
power
of
taxation.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
as
the
plaintiff
states
were
seeking
to
attack
the
louisiana
tax
at
issue.
so
it
would
have
general
applicability.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
and
that
question--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
justice
scalia.
your
honor,
south
carolina
has
said
that
this
case
is
about
consumption
of
water
in
toto.
but
when
you
look
at
their
bill
of
complaint,
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
when
you
look
at
the
question
presented
in
their
leave
for
--
their
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint,
it
starts
out
whether
north
carolina's
interbasin
transfer
statute
is
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and
when
you
look
at
the
allegations
in
the
bill
of
complaint,
it
is
specifically
focused
on
interbasin
transfers.
it
asserts
that
they
are
inequitable,
and
it
is
seeking
injunctive
relief
with
respect
to
those
interbasin
transfers.
we--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
are
--
there
are
very
few
interbasin
transfers.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
two
intervenors
that
have
interbasin
transfers
account
for
the
vast
majority
of
the
water
that
is
consumed
as
a
result
of
an
interbasin
transfer.
in
the
2006
study
that
was
done
by
duke
energy,
the
largest
interbasin
transfer
is
the
city
of
charlotte
at
9
million
gallons
per
day.
the
second--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that
was
an
accommodation
from
the
state
of
north
carolina
with
respect
to
the
intervenors.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
the
intervention
motion
directly
affects
each
of
these
intervenors,
and
they
have
a
right
to
be
heard
with
respect
to
that
intervention
motion.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
we
are
ceding
our
sovereignty.
with
respect
to
duke
energy
and
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project,
north
carolina
does
not
and
cannot
adequately
represent
their
interests
with
respect
to
duke
energy.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
okay,
with
respect
to
duke
energy:
duke
is
--
has
11
dams
in
north
and
south
carolina.
as
a
result
of
those
dams,
duke
energy
controls
the
flow
of
the
river
into
south
carolina.
as--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
their
interests
are
inseparable,
specifically
with
regard
to
duke
energy.
duke
negotiated,
over
a
period
of
several
years,
a
comprehensive
relicensing
agreement,
with
various
agencies
of
north
carolina,
various
agencies
of
south
carolina,
and
stakeholders
up
and
down
this
river.
as
a
result
of
that
negotiated
agreement,
there
was
--
the
cra
was
put
in
place,
which
is
essentially
a
request
that
ferc
issue
a
license
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
that
agreement.
that
agreement
would
set
a
minimum
flow
of
water
into
south
carolina
that
is
much,
much
higher
than
the
previous
license.
now,
south
carolina
has
come
into
court
and
has
attacked
that
agreement.
duke
has
a
very
real
and
substantial
interest
with
respect
to
that
agreement.
but--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
north
carolina
will
defend
these
interbasin
transfers,
but
with
respect
to
duke
energy,
we
are
not
aligned
with
duke
energy
because
duke
has
a
very
real
interest
in
preserving--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
we
believe
that
they
have
a
right
to
be
heard
because
of
their
compelling
interests
that
are
affected
in
this
case.
south
carolina
is
seeking
to
change
the
cra,
to
have
a
flow
of
water
that
is
much
higher
than
is
set
out
in
the
cra.
although
north
carolina
supports--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
not
only
are
we
resisting
that--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
north
carolina
will
resist
having
south
carolina
have
a
greater
flow
of
water
than--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
in
our
interest
because
even--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--that
will,
ultimately,
be
our
request
in
this
case
because
south
carolina
has
attacked
that
agreement.
from
north
carolina's
perspective,
south
carolina
is
receiving
much
more
water
under
this
negotiated
agreement
than
they
could
ever
hope
to
achieve
in
an
equitable
apportionment
action.
so
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
will
be
asking
this
court
to
issue
a
decree
that
sets
a
flow
of
water
less
than--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--we
will
not
represent
the
interest
of
duke,
given
their--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--with
respect--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--with
respect
to
the
city,
we
have
said
in
our
briefs
that
we
will
defend
this
interbasin
transfer.
we
believe
that
we
will
represent
the
city
of
charlotte
with
respect
to
that
regard,
but
we
also
support
their
intervention
motions
because
we
do
not
believe
that
it
would
result
in
them
impeaching
the
interests
of
north
carolina.
and
more
importantly,
the
special
master
got
it
right,
that
there
is
--
this
is
a
specific
attack
on
the
city
of
charlotte
and
its
unique
interests.
it
is
seeking
injunctive
relief
that
will
cripple
the
largest
city
in
north
and
south
carolina.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
we
will
defend
this
interbasin
transfer,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
injunctive
relief
is
sought
as
against
charlotte,
and
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
fairness
in
allowing
that
entity
to
be
present
in
this
court.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
now,
turning--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor,
that
that
is
an
interstate
entity.
it
--
its
interests
have
been
expressly
attacked,
the
interbasin
transfer.
south
carolina
singles
it
out
in
the
bill
of
complaint.
what's
more
important--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes.
we--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--we
--
we
cannot
represent
the
interests
of
the
joint
venture.
they
have
an
interbasin
transfer,
pursuant
to
the
north
carolina
statute
for
union
county.
but
what
the
complaint
doesn't
disclose
is
that
the
other
half
of
that
joint
venture
also
has
an
interbasin
transfer
with
respect
to
lancaster
county,
south
carolina.
so
south
carolina
can
hardly
attack
the
union
county
interbasin
transfer
while
simultaneously
defending
the
lancaster
county,
south
carolina,
interbasin
transfer.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
if
that
were
the
--
the
standard,
there
would
never
be
intervention
motions
in
any
of
these
proceedings.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
entities
have
unique
interests,
and
with
respect
to
two
of
those
interests
--
duke
energy
and
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
--
their
interests
are
not
represented
by
either
state.
all
three
of
them
have
been
expressly
attacked
in
the
complaint,
and
fairness
dictates
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
thank
you.
