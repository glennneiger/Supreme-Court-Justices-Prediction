justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
percentage,
approximately,
of
the
river
that
flows
into
south
carolina
that
the
three
intervenors
account
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
out
of
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
do
they
account
for,
like
--
there's
a
certain
amount
of
water
in
dispute.
there
are
some
people
who
want
to
intervene.
are
the
people
who
intervene
--
do
they
account
more
like
1
percent
of
all
the
water
that's
in
dispute,
or
do
they
account
for
more
like
50
percent?
that
seems
like
a
pretty
relevant
question
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
must
have
some
idea.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
significant
--
is
that
more
like
3
percent,
or
is
it
more
like
90
percent?
i
mean,
nobody
has
ever
bothered
to
look
at
that
in
this
whole
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that's
--
i
agree.
that's
a
good
point,
but
--
so
what
percentage
if
--
what
percentage
of
the
interbasin
transfers
do
they
account
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
insofar
--
so
insofar
as
what
they
are
after
is
interbasin
transfers,
just
what
justice
scalia
said
is
correct.
these
are
the
interbasin
transfer
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
helpful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
is
just
this
involved?
is
there
--
because
i
am
amazed
that
this
is
now
coming
to
me
for
the
first
time.
all
this
case
is
about
is
interbasin
transfers
and
that
you
account
for
100
percent
of
them,
you
three.
is
that
--
is
that
right?
because
i
suspect
in,
like,
5
minutes,
somebody
might
tell
me
it's
not
right.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
that's
not
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
--
i'm
trying
--
look,
if
alaska
sued
california
and
the
complaint
was
we
want
san
francisco
back,
san
francisco
might
have
a
right
to
intervene.
but
if
it
was
about
california
generally,
maybe
they
wouldn't.
so
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what's
the
water
that
is
at
issue
in
this
complaint
and
how
much
of
the
water
that
is
at
issue
in
this
complaint
do
the
three
intervenors
account
for?
that
seems
like
a
fairly
simple
empirical
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
the
answer
to.
