mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
special
master
correctly
concluded
that
charlotte,
duke,
and
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
should
intervene
in
this
original
action.
her
recommendation
deserves
some
deference
because
she
is
in
the
best
position
to
know
whether
these
parties
would
assist
her
in
the
adjudication
of
this
complex
dispute.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
our
claim
is
not
that
the
special
master
should
get
deference
on
legal
questions,
but
she
should
get
deference
on
--
on
the
narrow
question
of
whether
it
would
be
helpful
to
her
to
have
these
intervenors
in
the
case.
she
has--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--well,
she
pointed
out,
for
example,
that
duke
energy,
which
controls
the
flow
of
this
river
and
is
participating
in
the
ferc
proceedings,
would
establish
a
--
a
direct
link
between
this
adjudication
and
what's
going
on
before
the
ferc.
and
of
course
those
two
proceedings
have
--
have
a
lot
of
interaction.
i
think
it's
also
fair
to--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--oh,
i
think--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--i
think
ferc
has
not
said
that
there
will
be
no
effect,
that
there
would
be
no
effect
upon
the
licensing
proceeding
from
the
original
action.
there
could
be
a
conflict
between
the
decree
that
comes
down,
if
one
comes
down
in
this
court,
and
the
terms
of
the
ferc
license.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
well,
duke
of
course
pulled
together
69
other
stakeholders
to
join
the
comprehensive
relicensing
agreement
to
--
to
smooth
ferc's
acceptance
of
--
of
the
new
license.
and
this
original
action
is
--
will
pit
the
two
carolinas,
each
of
which
seeks
to
maximize
their
share
of
the
river,
and
those
interests
work
at
odds
with
the
cra,
which
endorses
a
compromise
middle
flow
position
that
--
that
neither
of
the
carolinas
seeks
to
defend
in
this
action.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
mr.
chief
justice,
private
parties
and
cities
have
intervened
in
the
past
in
original
actions
and
have
been
named
as
defendants
in
original
actions.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
well,
in
--
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
case
of
new
jersey
v.
new
york,
new
york
city
was
a
party
defendant,
and
in
this
case
the
city
of
charlotte
occupies
the
exact
same
position
as
new
york
city.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
it
did,
but
of
course
a
state
can
only
sue
a
proper
party
defendant.
whether
the
question
is
intervention
or
whether
it's
naming
a
city
as
a
defendant
in
an
original
action,
both
have
to
pass
the
test
of
is
this
city
or
non-state
a
proper
party
defendant?
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
that
--
that
is
not
their
exclusive
interest.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
no.
duke
energy,
for
example,
doesn't
have
an
interest
in
maximizing
the
flow
on
the
north
carolina
side
of
the
river.
duke's
--
duke
energy's
interest
is
in
preserving
the
--
the
flow
compromise
reflected
in
the
cra.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
well,
when
--
when
south
carolina
first
opposed,
for
example,
charlotte's
motion
to
intervene,
it
said:
oh,
charlotte,
you
can
file
an
amicus
brief
as
to
any
dispositive
motion.
well,
that
kind
of
amicus
participation
is
vastly
different
from
being
able
to
shape
the
record
on
which
the
--
the
key
issues
in
this
case
are
finally
decided.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
it
would
allow
us
to
seek
leave
to
file
exceptions
to
an--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--yes.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
well,
let
me
say
two
things,
mr.
chief
justice:
if
the
proposed
decree
affects
the
interests
of
charlotte
or
the
joint
venture
or
duke,
i
think
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
file
exceptions,
which
this
court
can
grant
leave
or
not.
as
to
the
specter
of
20
possible
intervenors--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--well,
south
carolina
and
the
united
states
present
this
vision
of
an
equitable
apportionment
action
in
which
the
special
master
simply
divides
up
the
flow
of
the
river,
and
then
it's
up
to
each
state
to
subdivide
among
its
users.
but
that
is
not
what
has
happened
in
equitable
apportionment
cases.
in
new
jersey
v.
new
york,
for
example,
this
court
entered
a
decree,
which
enjoined
the
flow
of
the
delaware
river
to
new
york
city
above
a
specified
level.
i
think
411
cubic
feet
per
second.
and
--
and
that
is
the
kind
of
decree
that
south
carolina,
i
believe,
is
seeking
in
this
case.
if
you
look
at
paragraph
2
of
south
carolina's
prayer
for
relief,
they
want
an
injunction
against
the
interbasin
transfers
currently
being
carried
--
carried
out
by
charlotte
and
the
joint
venture.
so
this--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--well,
as
to
duke
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
explained,
duke's
interest
is
not
in
maximizing
the
share
--
north
carolina's
share
of
the
river.
the
joint
venture
of
the
catawba
river
water
supply
project
is
not
represented
by
either
state
because
it's
a
bi-state
entity.
neither
--
and
both
of
the
carolinas
is
--
are
affirmatively
hostile
to
part
of
the
operations
of
the
joint
venture.
when
the
joint
venture--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
this
--
this
is
not
a
novel
proposition.
the
city
of
port
arthur
was
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
case
of
texas
v.
louisiana.
five
indian
tribes
intervened
in
arizona
v.
california,
and
new
york
city
was
allowed
to
be
a
party
defendant
in
the
new
jersey
case,
even
though
the
court
could
have
dismissed
it
from
the
case,
as
it
did
to
the
indiana
citizens
in--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--we--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--we
are
saying
that
the
special
master
got
it
right,
when
she
said
that
you
have
to
show
a
compelling
interest
that's
not
properly
represented
by
a
party
state,
and
she
applied
the
new
jersey
v.
new
york
test,
finding,
at
page
27
of
her
report,
that
neither
charlotte
nor
the
joint
venture
are
properly
represented.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
i
think
the
question
is--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--i
think
the
question
is,
should
the
court
accept
the
special
master's
recommendation?
and
i
would
disagree
with
south
carolina,
when
it
says
that
she
applied
the
wrong
legal
test.
she
did
apply
new
jersey
v.
new
york.
she
did
find
that
the
intervenors
were
not
properly
represented
by
the
party
states.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
but
not
mere
users.
their
status
is
special.
duke,
of
course,
is
unique.
it
controls
the
flow
of
the
river,
and
there's
no
one
else
like
duke
on
the
catawba.
the
other
two
intervenors
are
the
cause
of
the
harm
for
which
south
carolina
seeks
injunctive
relief.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
certainly,
our
position
is
not
that
mere
users
of
water
or
all
users
of
water
may
intervene
in
original
action.
you
have
to
show
a
compelling
interest
that's
not
properly
represented,
and
that's
going
to
depend
upon
the
specific
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
no,
justice
scalia.
i
would
say
it's
not
automatic
because
there
are
some
other
considerations
the
special
master
can
bring
to
bear.
for
example,
timeliness
--
you
can't
show
up
20
years
after
the
litigation
has
started,
like
the
city
of
philadelphia,
and
expect
to
get
in.
you--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--correct.
or,
conversely,
how--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--that's
correct.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
it
is
discretionary,
and
if
--
if
the
special
master
believes
that
--
that
this
complex
multiyear
water
rights
dispute
would
be
aided
by
the
presence
of
a
--
of
a
limited
number
of
intervenors
who
have
a
very
special
interest
in
the
case,
then
that's
something
that,
for
institutional--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--well,
charlotte
has
special
status
because
south
carolina
seeks
specific
relief
--
injunctive
relief
--
against
charlotte's
interbasin
transfer.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
it's
not
just
that
it's
--
it's
a
big
interest,
and
it
surely
is,
but
they
are
singled
out
in
south
carolina's
complaint,
and
injunctive
relief
is
sought
against
them,
which,
i
think,
brings
into
the
play
the
rule
this
court
announced
in
kentucky
v.
indiana,
which
is
that,
if
a
plaintiff
or
plaintiff
state
in
an
original
action
is
seeking
relief
against
a
citizen
of
a
state,
that
citizen
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
to
come
into
the
litigation
and
defend
its
interests.
that's
what
charlotte
is
seeking
in
this
case.
the
joint
venture,
of
course,
is
not
represented
by
either
state
fully
because
both
states
are
hostile
to
at
least
part
of
what
the
joint
venture
does.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
no
--
well,
of
course--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--no.
as
in
kentucky
v.
indiana,
if
there
are
improper
parties
in
original
action,
they
--
they
can
be
dismissed,
but
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
the
court
allowed
the
new
jersey
litigation
to
proceed
with
new
york
city
as
a
party
defendant.
and
charlotte's
position
is
truly
indistinguishable
from
the
position
of
--
of
new
york
city
in
that
action,
with
--
with
the
sole
exception
that
charlotte
seeks
to
intervene,
whereas
new
york
city
was
named
as
a
party
defendant.
south
carolina
invokes
the
principle
that
it
is
the
master
of
its
complaint,
and
we
would
agree
with
that,
in
part.
a
plaintiff
is
the
master
of
the
allegations
in
claims
it
seeks
to
make,
but
a
plaintiff
is
not
a
master
of
the
universe
of
--
of
interests
that
--
that
may
be
affected
by
the
lawsuit
they
have
--
they
have
brought.
that's--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--yes.
i
think
there
would
be
a
very
similar
analysis.
i
think
that
the
question
whether
a
proposed
defendant
--
and
of
course,
you
need
leave
from
this
court
to
file
an
original
action
or
to
name
someone
as
a
defendant
in
an
original
action.
i
think,
in
both
cases,
it
raises
the
question:
is
--
is
this
entity
a
proper
party
defendant
or
is
the
entity
a
proper
intervenor?
i
think
it's
a
similar
analysis.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
in
this
respect,
justice
stevens:
the
--
the
complaint
prays
for
north
carolina
to
stop
authorizing
the
interbasin
transfers
being
carried
out
by
charlotte
and
the
joint
venture.
but
--
but
charlotte
and
the
joint
venture
are
the
entities
whose
primary
conduct,
if
you
will,
would
be
affected
by
that
injunction.
they
are
the
parties
who
are
carrying
out
the
interbasin
transfers,
and
they
would
have
to
stop
those
transfers
if
--
if
authorization
was
withdrawn
by
north
carolina.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
i
think
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
she
came
down
--
if
she
were
to
come
down
with
a
decree,
it
would
not
be
surprising
that
--
that
it
would
decide
whether
or
not
to
allow
charlotte's
interbasin
transfers
to
continue.
because
that's
--
that
was
much
like
what
was
decided,
for
example,
in
new
jersey
v.
new
york.
there
was
the
proposed
diversion
of
water
to
new
york
city,
and
the
court
there
ultimately
entered
a
partial
injunction
that
banned
flows
to
new
york
city
above
a
certain
level.
so--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--and,
justice
scalia--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--not
just
massive.
there's
--
it's
no
accident
that
south
carolina
focuses
upon
these
interbasin
transfers,
because
they
inflict
a
special
injury,
in
south
carolina's
view.
the
interbasin
transfers
take
water
out
of
the
river
basin,
and
--
and
so
it
doesn't
come
back
to
south
carolina
within
the
basin.
other
types
of
uses
of
water
are
non-consumptive,
in
the
sense
that
the
water
can
be
treated
and
eventually
gets
to
south
carolina
within
that
basin.
but
south
carolina
has
targeted
these
interbasin
transfers
because
they
are
entirely,
100
percent
consumptive,
in
the
sense
that
--
that
once
the
water
has
left
the
basin--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--it
does
--
it
does
not
come
back.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
i
don't
think
i
have
done
that
math,
justice
breyer.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
yes.
i
can
tell
you
that
charlotte's
authorization
is
--
is
33
million
gallons
a
day.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
well,
the
flow
of
the
river
--
the
minimum
flow
of
the
river,
under
the
--
under
the
cra
is
1100
cubic
feet
per
second,
so
unfortunately
you'd
have
to
--
you'd
have
to
convert
from
cfs
to--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--well,
i
--
it's
a
significant
proportion.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
it's
a
significant
proportion.
it's
not--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--well,
i
haven't
done
that
calculation.
i
will
say
that
they
are
significant
enough
that
south
carolina
seeks
a
specific
injunction
against
those
interbasin
transfers.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
and
as
the
special
master
read
it,
ibts
are--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--well,
they
represent,
actually,
100
percent
of
the
interbasin
transfers--
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
--being
carried
out.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
these
are
the
--
the
ibts
at
issue.
mr.
h.
christopher
bartolomucci
thank
you.
