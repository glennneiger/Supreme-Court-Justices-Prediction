mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
question
of
how
the
public
can
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
government
that
errors
and
fraud
have
been
discovered.
first
of
all,
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
petitions
do
not
become
public
records
after
the
verification
process
but,
in
fact,
are
made
available
as
public
records
before
the
verification
process
even
begins.
this
is
because
the
secretary
of
state's
first
step
after
receiving
submitted
petitions
is
to
take
them
to
his
archiving
section
and
to
have
them
digitized.
as
soon
as
they're
digitized,
they're
available
on
disks
for
anyone
who
requests
them.
then
the
verification
process
begins.
during
the
verification
process,
it
is
possible--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--the
verification
process,
justice
sotomayor?
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
the
verification
process
will
depend
on
how
many
signatures
have
been
submitted--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
they're--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
that's
correct.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
referendum
71,
the
proponents
of
the
referendum
submitted
the
petition
sheets
on
saturday,
july
25,
2009,
and
on
tuesday,
july
28,
a
records
request
was
already
submitted.
and
so
they
can
obtain
records--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
kennedy,
this
is
part
of
the
public
records
act.
this
is
as
a
result
of
the
public
records
act
that
these
petition
sheets
are
made
available.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well,
when
the
initiative
and
referendum
processes
were
created
by
public
vote
on
a
constitutional
amendment
of
1912,
there
was
no
public
records
act
at
all.
and
the
public
records
act,
an
act
of
general
applicability,
was
adopted
by
the
voters
in
1973
as
part
of
an
initiative
which
also
enacted
comprehensive
campaign
finance
reform.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
--
we
do
believe
that
first
amendment
interests
would
be
implicated
by
revealing
how
people
voted,
and
we
don't
see
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
knowing
how
people
voted,
only
in
who
voted--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--no.
no,
justice
scalia.
i--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
justice
scalia,
i
didn't
say
that
i
thought
that
the
secret
ballot
was
constitutionally
required.
i
was
asked
by
the
chief
justice
whether
some
first
amendment
interests
would
be
implicated.
they
probably
would
be.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well,
the
first
amendment
interest
in
how
you
vote?
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
you
know,
it
might
be
implicated
by
a
potential
chill
from
voting,
if
you
know
your
vote
is
going
to
be
revealed.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
mr.
chief
justice,
some
chill
may
result,
just
as
some
chill
may
result
from
having
your
campaign
contributions
disclosed
or
the
fact
that
you
have
registered
to
vote
and
provided
your
name,
address,
your
voting
history
is
being
disclosed.
so
some
chill
might
be
--
might
result,
but
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
significant
enough.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
how
you
voted
would
have
a
much
greater
chilling
effect
than
the
fact
that
you
are
registered
to
vote.
and
--
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
not
ruled
on
whether
the
secret
ballot
is,
you
know,
a
constitutional
right.
if
--
if
it
is,
then
is
town
hall
voting
in
new
england
unconstitutional?
is
the
caucus
system
in
iowa
for
presidential
candidates
unconstitutional?
the
court
in
this
case
does
not
have--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--we
don't
--
we
don't
know
if
this
court
would
rule
that
the
vote
could
never
be
revealed.
we
know
that
in
some
places,
votes
are
done
in
public.
we
know
that
before
the
late
1800s,
there
was
no
secret
ballot.
we
just
--
we
don't
know
what
the
constitutional
ruling
would
be.
but
we
--
we
do
know
that
in
this
case,
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that
--
that
determination,
because
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--it
--
it
would
depend
on
the
strength
of
the
state
interest
in
having
the
telephone
number.
the
state
does
not
have
an
interest
in
the
telephone
number
on
the
petition
form,
because
the
state
has
--
only
needs
to
know
from
the
petition
form
the
name
and
the
address
in
order
to
verify--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--it
--
yes,
it
probably
would
make
it
easier
for
people
to
contact.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
but
the
policy--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--that
would
be
a
policy
determination
for
the
legislature
to
make,
justice
alito.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
i
believe
it
could
permit
that,
yes,
justice
alito.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
would,
justice
alito.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
breyer,
that
is
count
2.
that
is
count
2
of
the
petitioners'
complaint.
this
court
ruled
as
recently
as
citizens
united
that
such
situations
should
be
evaluated
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
evaluate
the
reasonable
probability
of
threats,
harassments,
and
reprisals.
but
that--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
justice
scalia.
that
would
be
the
socialist
workers
party
case.
this
--
this
court
has
ruled
that,
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
it
is
possible
that
some
information
otherwise
disclosed--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--of
any
type
of
petition
including
nominating
petitions--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--initiative
petitions,
and
the
rest.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well,
of
course,
boycotts
have
been
upheld
under
the
first
amendment
in
claiborne
hardware,
and
so
if
someone
wanted
to
boycott
a
business
because
it
turned
out
that
the
manager
of
the
business
had
been
a
supporter
of
a
particular
ballot
measure,
that
would
be
allowable,
of
course,
to
that
person
choosing
to
boycott.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
of
course
--
yes,
they
could
apply
for
another
preliminary
injunction
if
this
court
upholds
the
court
of
appeals.
they
were
able
to
obtain
that
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case,
which
is
why
these
petition
forms
have
not
been
released
to
date,
except
under
a
protective
order
by
the
court
to
the
opponents.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
we
--
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
record.
there's
no
evidence--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--involving
the
referendum
71
signers?
no.
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
about
people
who
were
out
circulating
petitions,
people
who
were
out,
you
know,
campaigning
for
the
petitions,
the
campaign
manager
for
the
measure.
but
none
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
speaks
to
petition
signers,
and
none
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
speaks
to
petition
signers
for
other,
similar
measures
which
were
cited
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
that
is
--
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
of
course,
in
several
other
states,
arkansas,
florida,
and
massachusetts,
which
had
similar
measures
regarding
gay
civil
rights
or
same-sex
marriage
on
the
ballot
--
in
those
three
states,
the
petition
forms
were
obtained
under
public
records,
were
put
on
the
internet,
and
no
evidence
has
been
provided
that's
in
the
record
that
anyone
who
signed
any
of
those
petitions
in
those
three
states
was
subjected
to
harassment--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--justice
alito,
it
would
be
possible
procedurally
for
them
to
bring
the
motion
for
an
injunction
even
before
collecting
the
signatures--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--if
they
had
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
i
believe
that
the
sponsors
of
the
measure
would
bring
to
the
court
evidence,
if
they
have
any,
of
--
because
of
the
controversial
nature
of
that
particular
measure,
that
is
based
on
what's
happened
to
some
of
the
people
who
were
planning
to
put
the
measure
on
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
right.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
one
could
look
to--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--i
imagine,
justice
scalia,
that
the
individuals
moving
for
that
preliminary
injunction
would
do
what
the
petitioners
have
done
in
this
case.
they
would
cite
to
an
example
from
another
state
involving
a
comparable
measure.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
they
could
bring
it
into
the
court.
i'm
not
saying
the
court
would
accept
it,
because
i
don't
know--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--justice
scalia,
i
didn't
say
it
couldn't
be
acceptable.
i'm
saying
this
is
a
hypothetical,
so
i
don't
know
what
the
evidence
would
look
like
in
the
hypothetical
example.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
alito,
i
think
that
the
evidence
would
have
to
be
very
strong.
it
would
have
to
rise
above
criticism.
i
think
it
would
have
to
rise
to
the
level
of
threatened
violence.
it
would
have
to
rise
to
the
level
of
the
socialist
workers
party
case,
for
example,
or
the
naacp
case.
i
think
the
standard
would
be
very
high.
but
it
would
be
up
to
the
trial
judge
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
issue
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
there
has
not,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that's
even
though
a
half
a
dozen
initiatives
on
a
variety
of
topics
have
been
released.
another
half
dozen
are
pending.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
there
has
been
no
measure
on
domestic
partner
benefits
or
same-sex
marriage
in
washington
state--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--but
there
are
other--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--justice--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--well--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--in
washington
state.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
had
measures
on
assisted
suicide,
for
example,
which
was
very
controversial,
and
--
and
there's
no
evidence
involving
that
set
of
petitions.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
it
was
--
well,
the
referendum
challenges
the
assisted
suicide
law.
so
if
you
vote
for
the
referendum,
you
vote
to
uphold
the
legislature's
adoption
of
that
law,
which
--
which
allowed
assisted
suicide.
so
there
have
been
controversial
measures.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
kennedy,
we
have
considered
the
history
of
the
petition
clause,
and
we
see
a
basic
difference
between
the
kinds
of
petitions
under
the
petition
clause
and
the
petitions
at
issue
here
because,
essentially,
petitioning
the
government
under
the
petition
clause
is
asking
the
government
to
do
something.
you're
petitioning
them:
please
do
something.
the
petitions
for
a
referendum
or
an
initiative
are
telling
the
government
to
do
something.
the
petition
form
says
that
i,
the
signer,
am
directing
the
secretary
of
state
to
conduct
an
election.
and
by
submitting
these
petitions
in
a
referendum,
i
am
suspending
the
law
which
the
legislature
has
already
approved
until
the
election
has
taken
place.
tell
versus
ask.
i
think
that's
a
pretty
big
--
a
significant
difference.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
and,
justice
kennedy,
i'd
like
to
speak
to
that
question,
because
several
justices
asked:
well,
what
can
we
tell
from
what,
you
know,
someone
who
signed?
do
we
know
how
they're
going
to
vote.
i
--
i
agree
that
many
people
signing
a
petition
are
going
to
vote
in
favor
of
--
in
the
case
of
an
initiative,
in
favor
of
the
law
the
initiative
would
put
on
the
ballot.
but
also
we
know
from
the
social
science
research,
which
is
cited,
for
example,
in
the
direct
democracy
scholars
green
brief,
that
many
people
sign
simply
because
they
believe
it's
important
for
the
--
for
the
public
to
have
an
opportunity
to
vote.
and,
of
course,
as
the
petitioners
have
acknowledged
and
we
also
point
out,
some
people
vote
just
to
get
around
the
circulator
and
get
into
the
store.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
the
percentage
of
people
who
believe
simply
that
there
should
be
a
vote
held
has
not
been
quantified
by
the
research,
except
that
several
scholars
indicate
that
it
is
significant.
so,
whether
it's
20
percent
or
40
percent,
i
--
i
really
can't
say
within
a
certain--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--it
is
possible.
but
it's
also
possible
some
of
those
20
percent
don't
have
an
opinion
on
the
law,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
simply
think
that
there
should
be
a
vote
held,
and
they'll
make
their
mind
up
later
on.
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
aren't
aware
when
certain
laws
are
--
are
adopted
that
are
subjected
to
a
referendum,
and
they
may
not
have
decided
at
all.
in
fact,
one
of
the
reasons
they
may
sign
the
petition
is
to
say:
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
i'm
going
to
vote,
but,
you
know,
i
think
a
public
vote
would
be
a
good
idea.
so,
i'm
going
to
let
it
go
forward
to
be
on
the
ballot,
and
i'll
decide.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
alito,
the
--
just
to
be
clear,
you
are
right.
they
do
use
computer
--
computers
because
when
--
in
the
verification
process,
the
secretary
of
state's
staff,
with
the
observers
looking
over
their
shoulder,
will
look
at
the
petition
and
look
up
that
voter
in
an
--
in
an
electronic
voter
registration
database.
this
is
exactly
why
the
information
is
so
useful
to
the
public
as
well.
they
have
access
to
electronic
online
voter
registration
history
as
well,
and
they
can
also
check.
in
--
in
massachusetts,
under
their
public
records
law
in
2006,
petition
forms
obtained
by
public
records
requests
were
put
online,
and
over
2,000
people,
as
has
been
documented
in
the
lambda
amicus
brief,
discovered
that
they
--
their
names
are
on
petitions
that
they
claimed
did
not
sign,
and
discovered
that
they
had
been,
in
some
cases,
misled.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
justice
alito,
that
--
that
could
be
done.
in
our
state
and
the
other
states
that's
done
when
somebody
requests
the
public
records
and
chooses
them
to
put
online.
the
state
doesn't
--
does
not
put
the
petition
forms
online
itself,
although,
you
know,
other
information
is
put
online
by
the
state.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
we
are
not
taking
that
position,
justice
kennedy.
of
course--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--what
we
know,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
in
dozens
of
states
around
the
--
around
the
country,
as
recently
as
2009
in
maryland,
2006
in
massachusetts,
and
so
on,
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
public
who
requested
ballot
petitions
by
public
records
request
who
found
significant
fraud
and
error.
this
isn't
just
about
fraud
--
fraud
is
very
important
--
it's
also
about
finding
plain
old
mistakes
which
the
state,
secretary
of
state,
or
auditor
has
missed.
that
--
that
does
happen
with
regularity
in
this
country,
and
we
cite
cases
in
our
brief
where
error
is
not
fraud,
but
errors
in
washington
state
have
been
discovered
by
people
who
look
at
these
public
records.
and--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
sir.
justice
scalia,
we
agree.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
that
goes
to
the
heart
to
the
public
records
act,
justice
scalia:
trust
but
verify.
the
people
did
not
leave
to
the
state
the
idea
that,
well,
we'll
let
you
know
what
you
need
to
know.
the
people
want
a--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--the
speech
element
could
be
construed
in
the
fact
that
someone
has
chosen
to
sign
a
petition
which
we
know
means
they
want
something
to
be
put
on
the
ballot.
so,
they
favor
having
it
on
the
ballot.
that
--
that
much
we
know.
but
we
also
looked
to
burdick,
of
course,
because
in
this
--
in
--
in
the
burdick
decision
this
court
held
that
write-in
voting
could
be
prohibited
by
the
state
of
hawaii.
that
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court.
and
this
court
found
that
writing
in
a
candidate's
name
was
not
even
expressive
conduct.
so
we
look
to
the
burdick
level
of
intermediate
scrutiny,
to
the
o'brien
level
of
intermediate
scrutiny
for
the
test.
justice
ginsburg,
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
bring
up
is
something
about
buckley
ii,
which--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--the
non-speech
component
is
suspension
of
law
in
the
case
of
a
referendum
or
the
legislative
effect.
we
believe
this
is
a
legislative
act
fundamentally.
in--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--the
interest,
justice
alito,
is
knowing,
first
of
all,
that
there
were
a
sufficient
number
of
signatures
submitted
to
qualify
the
measure
for
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
that's
the
fraud
interest.
and,
secondly,
there
is
a
valid
informational
interest
in
knowing
who
is
it
exactly
who's
calling
for
this
election
and
suspending
the--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--no,
justice
alito,
we
don't
need
to
know
that.
we
need
to
know
whether
there
were
a
sufficient
number
of
registered
voters
who
signed
--
we
need
to
know
whether
they
signed
more
than
once.
we
need
to
know
they
are
registered
in
washington
state.
informational
interest
i
think
that
you
could
--
the
information
you
could
collect
to
satisfy
informational
interest
might
include
other
information
that's
in
the
voter
registration
records.
you
might
want
to
know--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--i
don't
see
what
the
valid
state
interest
would
be
of
knowing
the
ethnicity
of
the
person.
i
mean,
of
course,
anyone
could
look
at
the
petition
ballot
forms
and,
i
suppose,
divine
something
about
the
ethnicity
based
on
the
last
name,
but
the
state's
interest
doesn't
go
--
go
to
that.
that
we
--
we
don't
believe
we
need
to
know
that.
we
believe
we
need
to
know
what
is
requested
--
required
on
the
--
on
the
petition
form.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well,
justice
alito,
it
might
--
if
you
know
john
jones,
that
would
tell
you
something.
number
two,
we
know
from
the
--
we
know
from
the,
you
know,
direct
democracy
scholars
green
brief
that
intermediaries
and
especially
the
press
and
sometimes
social
science
researchers
and
others
will
--
will
look
at
the
names,
and
they'll
be
able
to
tell,
for
example,
that
a
large
number
of
employees
at
one
company
signed
a
measure;
maybe
it's
a
measure
that
would
cut
a
tax
break
for
a
particular
industry.
or
perhaps
members
of
a
union,
in
large
numbers,
have
signed.
they
have
been--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--able
to
provide
that
information.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--no,
you
do
not.
i'm
saying
intermediaries
might
discover
this,
for
example,
by
taking
a
close
look
at
who's
paying
for
the
signature
gathering.
if
it's
paid
signature
gathering,
they
might
be
aware
of
prominent
sponsors.
in
fact,
the
--
the
importance
of
knowing
who
the
sponsors
is,
is
demonstrated--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--well,
a
voter
who
--
who
works
at
that
same
company
or
does
business
with
that
same
company
might
know
that,
gosh,
i
know
these
employees,
and
they've
--
they
have
all
signed
this
petition.
the
press
might
be
able
to
do
the
research
to
find
that
out.
intermediaries
do
play
an
important
role.
the
last
point,
if
i
may,
i
wanted
to
make
about
--
about
buckley
ii
is
that
the
petitioners
have
stressed
that
buckley
ii
struck
down
the
requirement
to
wear
the
name
badge.
but
in
that
same
decision
this
court
upheld
the
requirement
by
colorado
that
affidavits
signed
by
the
petition
circulators,
including
the
petition
circulator's
name
and
address,
can
be
disclosed
as
public
records.
and
the
court
ruled
that
--
found
that
and
compared
it
favorably
to
the
badge
requirement
because
the
disclosures
of
public
record
occurred
after
the
heat
of
the
moment,
after
the
moment
of
interactive
discussion.
it
happened
later
on.
and
we
believe,
of
all
the
court's
rulings,
that
--
that
approval
of
the
disclosure
requirement
of
the
--
of
the
affidavit,
in
contrast
to
the
badges,
is
the
most
similar
to
requiring
after
the
fact
or
allowing
after
the
fact
for
petitions
to
be
disclosed
under
the
public
records
act.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
we
would
not,
justice
alito.
we
would
not
release
it
because
they
can
come
to
the
office
and
have
uncomfortable
conversations
with
them--
[laughter]
--which
i
can
personally
attest
happens
with
some
regularity.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
it
is,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
it
can.
their
names,
their
office
locations,
their
office
phone
numbers,
their
office
e-mails
is
all
a
matter
of
public
record
in
our
state.
thank
you
very
much.
