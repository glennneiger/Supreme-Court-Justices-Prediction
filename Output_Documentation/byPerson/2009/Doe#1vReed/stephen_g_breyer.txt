suppose
that
in
1957
in
little
rock,
a
group
of
little
rock
citizens
had
wanted
to
put
on
the
ballot
a
petition
to
require
the
school
board
to
reopen
central
high
school,
which
had
been
closed
because
there
was
a
sentiment
in
the
community
that
they
didn't
want
integration.
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
if
they
signed
this
petition,
there
was
a
very
good
chance
that
their
businesses
would
be
bombed,
that
they
would
certainly
be
boycotted,
that
their
children
might
be
harassed.
now,
is
there
no
first
amendment
right
in
protecting
those
people?
and
if
there
is,
how
does
it
differ
from
your
case?
