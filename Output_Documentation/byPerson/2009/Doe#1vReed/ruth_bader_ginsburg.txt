justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
but
don't
you
have
--
i
thought
we
were
dealing
with
count
1
of
the
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
count
2
would
be
the
counterpart
to
the
exception
that's
made
from
the
disclosure
requirement
with
regard
to
contributions
with
certain
organizations
whose
members
might
be
harassed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
--
that's
not
--
that
would
still
be
open
if
you
lose
the
first
part
of
this
case.
so
going
back
to
the
question
you
were
asked,
how
does
this
differ
--
that
justice
scalia
asked
--
how
does
this
differ
from
the
contributor
who
says,
well,
i
might
be
harassed?
the
contributor
would
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
why,
on
the
first
part,
should
it
be
any
different,
as
long
as
you
have
the
door
open
to
show
that
if
you
were
going
to
suffer
reprisals,
harassment,
that
an
exception
would
have
to
be
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
one
--
something
that
was
not
in
your
brief,
but
was
in
the
secretary's
brief.
is
this
list
available
to
project
marriage?
and
specifically
on
page
34
of
secretary
reed's
brief,
the
statement
is
made
that
the
sponsoring
organizations
sometimes
sell
or
trade
these
lists.
they
use
them
for
fundraising
purposes.
so
that
would
be
the
end
of
a
person's
privacy,
at
least
on
one
side.
is
that
true,
that
the
initiative
sponsor
uses
these
lists?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
don't
say:
now,
i
agree
you
can
use
my
name
for
fundraising
purposes.
but
that's
--
it's
implicit,
you
say,
in
their
signing
the
petition
that
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--signature
collector
can
sell
the
names,
use
them
for
its
own
fundraising
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
that's
--
that's
true
of
buckley
ii.
what
was
--
what
this
court
said
could
not
be
done
is
that
the
solicitor
could
not
be
made
to
wear
a
badge
that
says
"i
am
a
paid
solicitor",
but
that
the
solicitor's
name
had
to
be
identified
for
the
state.
certainly,
the
solicitor
--
there
was
an
affidavit,
and
there
was
the
filings
with
whatever
was
the
state
agency.
so
what
was
--
what
this
court
said
could
not
be
done
was
this
kind
of
in-your-face
big
button
that
says
"i
am
a
paid
solicitor",
but
the
solicitor's
name
and
address
certainly
had
to
be
disclosed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
just--
mr.
bopp
--
subjects
you
to
the
boycott.
let
me
stop
you
there,
because
i
think
your
--
your
own
brief,
i
think
you
said
twice
that
you
cannot
tell
anything
about
the
signer's
belief
from
the
mere
signature.
you
said
it
could
be
support
for
--
for
the
proposition
or
it
could
be
just
support
for
letting
the
people
decide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
it
could
even
be,
you
say,
that
this
solicitor
is
pesky,
and
in
order
to
placate
the
solicitor,
to
get
rid
of
the
solicitor,
we'll
just
sign.
so
you
--
you
have
said
that
--
that
the
signing
itself
is
ambiguous.
you
don't
know
what
the
reason
is.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
person
is
a
supporter
of
the
proposition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
call
your
attention
to
page
20
of
your
reply
brief?
because
i
don't
think
that
your
response
was
correct.
you
say:
do
petition
signers
support
the
repeal,
simply
indicate
they
would
like
public
election
to
be
held,
or
simply
sign
to
avoid
any
further
discussion
with
the
petition
circulator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
did
that.
it
wasn't
due
to
buckley
ii,
because
as
you
just
acknowledged,
under
buckley
ii,
the
solicitor
is
disclosed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bopp,
this
is
not
a
peculiar
thing
to
the
state
of
washington;
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
aren't
there
about
20-odd
states
that
require
disclosure
of
the
names
of
signers
to
initiatives,
referenda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
but
what
you're
saying
with
respect
to
washington
would
go
for
most
of
those
other
states
that
have
--
that
have
public
disclosure
of
initiative
and
referendum
petitions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
there
were
instances
where
the
state
official
missed
something
and
a
member
of
the
public
who
had
access
to
the
list
of
signers
said:
wait
a
minute;
i
know
so-and-so
was
my
neighbor
who
died
5
years
ago.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
mean
if
--
that
was
over.
it
passed
the
screen
of
the
secretary
of
state.
it's
disclosed
to
the
public.
if
someone
then
said
you've
got
a
lot
of
dead
souls
on
these
lists,
the
state
would
do
nothing
about
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we'll
ask
--
we'll
ask
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we'll
ask
the
attorney
general
of
washington.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
you
involve
the
court?
if
the
state's
--
the
executive
representative
of
the
state
says:
oh,
we
missed
that.
now
we're
going
to
have
to
deal
with
it.
we
don't
need
any
court
to
order
us
to
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
this
is
after
the
observers.
this
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we're
talking
about
a
member
of
the
public
noticing
that
there
are
people
on
the
list
who
shouldn't
be
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
they
ask
for
judicial
review
instead
of
going
first
to
the
state's
attorney
general
and
saying,
look,
you
--
your
people
missed
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
involve
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
you've
just
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
they're
--
that
they
are
immediately
available
on
the
disk,
and
so
while
the
checking
is
going
on
by
the
secretary,
the
public
has
the
list.
is
that
what
you've
just
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
--
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
because
nobody
got
to
count
2?
and
the
district
court
--
this
whole
case
in
the
lower
courts
was
on
count
1
alone;
wasn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
count
2
is
the
one
that
deals
with
the
harassment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
--
the
state
has
had
this
procedure
now
for
some
time,
and
there
have
been
controversial
ballot
initiatives.
is
there
any
history
in
the
state
of
washington
that
signers
have
been
subject
to
harassment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
did
say
something
about
this
category
of
speech.
you
said,
well,
this
is
in
the
category
that
--
it's
like
o'brien.
it
has
speech
elements
and
non-speech
elements.
and
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
which
--
what
is
it
in
the
signature
that
speaks
and
what
is
it
in
the
signature
that
doesn't
speak?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
out
of
the
case
up
till
now.
that's
count
2.
you
put
it
in
your
pleading,
but
it
wasn't
reached
by
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
everybody
agrees
that
that's
still
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
did
not
rule
on
whether
there
was
a
risk
of
harassment
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
dealt
only
with
count
1.
