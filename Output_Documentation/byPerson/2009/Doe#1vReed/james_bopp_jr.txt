mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
no
person
should
suffer
harassment
for
participating
in
our
political
system,
and
the
first
amendment
protects
citizens
from
intimidation
resulting
from
compelled
disclosure
of
their
identity
and
beliefs
and
their
private
associations.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--this
court
has
upheld
the
disclosure
in
buckley
v.
valeo
in
1976.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
it
could--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--it
could
potentially,
and
--
but
this
court
subjected
those
requirements
to
the
appropriate
constitutional
first
amendment
analysis,
found
that
there
was
sufficiently
important
governmental
interest,
some
of
which
are
not
present
when
we're
talking
about
a
referendum
or
initiative,
and
then
also
created
an
exception
from
even
a
generally
valid
statute
where
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
of
harassment
of
that
particular
individual
or
--
or
group.
so
the
first
amendment
analysis
regarding
the
privacy
of
association,
the
privacy
of
identity
and
beliefs,
the
potential
of
--
of
intimidation
are
all
elements
of
the
analysis
that
was
employed
by
the
court
in
buckley--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--no.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
we
believe
they
would
not.
they
would
certainly
be
subject
to
first
amendment
analysis.
but
in
--
in
those
--
in
the
instance
of
voter
registration,
there
are
other
governmental
interests
that
are
not
present
in
petition
signings
for
referendums.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
we
believe
it
would
be
subject
to
first
amendment
analysis.
but,
again,
there
are
different
governmental
interests
when
you
have
candidates
involved--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
one
is
you
have
candidates
involved--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--one
is
you
have
candidates
involved.
and
this
court
recognized
in
buckley
that
there
were
disclosure
interests
that
related
specifically,
and
actually
only,
to
candidates.
for
instance,
people
who
contribute
to
a
candidate,
that
information,
to
the
voter,
can
signal
the
interests
that
the
candidate,
once
he
or
she
takes
office,
will
be
responsive
to.
when
we
have
an
initiative,
we
know
what
the
law
is
that
is
being
voted
upon.
it's
not
a
matter
of
--
of
electing
a
representative.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
a
few
--
few
might
be,
but
we
think
this
is
marginal
information.
first,
they
are
adopting
a
law.
and
so
we
know
what
the
law
is.
and
--
and
while
it
might
be
marginal
information
for
a
few
people,
once
the
measure
qualifies
for
the
ballot,
this
is
only
--
the
petition
signature
and
distribution
is
only
for
a
very
limited
governmental
interest.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
that
--
and
that--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--and
that
limited
governmental
interest
is
to
preserve
state
money,
to
not
conduct
an
election
on
the
matter
unless
there
is
sufficient
public
support.
so--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
we're
only
challenging
the
application
of
the
public
records
act
to
petitions
and
referendum
petitions.
we're
not
challenging
it
as
it
would
be
applied
to
petitions
to
put
people
on
the
ballot.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
actually,
under
--
with
modern
technology,
it
only
takes
a
few
dedicated
supporters,
and
a
computer,
who
are
willing
to
map
--
to
put
this
information
on
the
internet,
mapquest
it,
as
they
did
with
respect
to
the
contributors
of
proposition
8,
which
resulted
in
--
and
then
encourage
people
to
harass
and
intimidate
them,
which
resulted
in
hundreds
of
examples
of
harassment--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
it
may
not
manifest
itself
in
--
in
any
particular
initiative.
we
agree
with
that,
but
we
think
the
potential
is
there,
and
there
is
usually
a
group
of
supporters
of
any
measure
that,
you
know,
are
passionate
about
that
particular
issue--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
with
this--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--buckley
dealt
with
that
exact
question.
and
first
--
the
first
step
of
the
analysis
is
whether
or
not
the
law
is
--
is
valid
under
the
first
amendment.
and
then
there
is
an
exception
to
even
a
valid
constitutional
--
a
constitutionally
valid
law.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
we
don't
think
that
the
exception
is
a
substitute
for
considering
the
initial
validity
of
the
law,
which--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
this
is
an
act
of
private
association.
the
petition
signers
are
associating
with
the
referendum
committee
for
purposes
of
placing
this
measure
on
the
ballot--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
what--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--what
is
implicit
is
they
are
associating
with
this
group
for
a
purpose,
and
that
is
support
for,
in
this
case,
referendum
71.
and
so
they
use
those
names
for
valid
purposes.
but--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes,
buckley
ii.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
buckley
ii.
you
struck
down
the
requirement
that
the
person
who
is
soliciting
signatures
self-identify.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that
is
a
process--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
you
have
already
opined
in
buckley
ii
that
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
clipboard
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that
is
true.
you've
correctly
described
buckley
ii.
but
as
we
can
see
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
public
disclosure
of
the
petition
names
in
this
case
--
there
was
a
planned
harassment
and
intimidation
of
these
voters
by--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
under
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
but
what
we're
--
but
what
is
involved
here
that
is
not
involved
there
is
the
requirement
by
the
government
that
you
publicly
disclose
your
identity
and
beliefs
on
a
matter
that
then--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--that
is--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--but,
with
all
due
respect,
we
did
not
say
the
third.
we
did
say
the
first
and
the
second.
and
--
but
either
of
those
are
political
statements.
the
highlighted
box
at
the
top,
you
know,
states
--
states
that
by
signing
r-71,
we
can
reverse
that
decision,
meaning
the
passage
of
a
law,
and
protect
marriage
between
a
man
and
a
woman.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
acknowledge
that
we
said
that,
justice
ginsburg.
and,
of
course,
the
second
statement
is
--
and
which
i
think
is
the
dominant
statement
and
certainly
sufficient
--
and
that
is
that
we
want
a
measure
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot
in
order
for
the
people
to
vote.
that
is
one
of
the
central--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
think
it's
very
unlikely.
but
it
--
we
acknowledge
it's
possible,
but
we
think
it's
very
unlikely.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
very
few.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
actually,
after
your
buckley
ii
decision,
the
ninth
circuit
struck
down
the
requirement
of
disclosing
the
paid
circulators.
and,
of
course,
in
california,
petitions
are
not
public.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
the
ninth
circuit
thought
it
was
buckley--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--there
is
no
evidence--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
is
pertinent
information,
and,
at
most,
we
think
it
is
marginal
information.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
potentially.
and
--
and
this
court
--
i
--
because
it
would
be
required
to
be
subject
to
a
first
amendment
analysis.
it's
this
court
that
created,
in
the
naacp
case--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--the
right
of
private
association.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
they're
not
compelling
ms.
mcintyre
to
distribute
her
brochure,
either.
but
this
court
held
that--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
the
government,
you
know,
has
a
lot
of
options.
for
instance,
they
don't
have
to
conduct
elections
for
the
election
of
judge.
but
if
they
opt
to
do
that
and
provide
that
procedure,
well,
then,
the
first
amendment
applies
to
the
political
speech--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--and
your
employer,
as
in
this
case
here.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no
--
no,
because
there
is
no
sufficient
governmental
interest
that
would
justify
it.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
they,
of
course,
can
--
can
check
that.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
they
can
get
your
name--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--and
we're
not
objecting
to
filing
of
a
petition.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
no,
i'm
not
objecting
to
that.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
they
have
procedures
to
check
and
verify
these
signatures
that
do
not
involve
public
disclosure.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
california
law
does
not
require
disclosure
of
the
petitions,
and
that
has
been
upheld
by
the
courts
of
california.
and
you
can
verify
these
signatures.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
but
you
asked
about
california--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--if
i
heard
your
question.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
okay.
it--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--in
a
sense--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--actually,
for--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--actually,
for
a
century,
they
chose
not
to
do
this.
it
wasn't
until
2006--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--they
did
not
publicly
disclose
the
petitions
for
a
century.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
only
in
the
most
general
sense.
they
adopted
a
public
records
act.
they
didn't
adopt
a
law
that
specifically
required
the
disclosure
of
these
petitions.
but
in
a
general
sense,
they
did.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that
is
true.
some
--
some
in
their
initiative
and
referendum
statute,
because
they
actually
provide
some
public
input
on
verification
where
washington
does
not;
others
under
their
public
records
act.
some
do
not,
such
as
california.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
one
--
one
thing
we
say
is
different
between
washington
and
these
other
states
is
that
washington
provides
no
way
for
the
public,
even
if
they
get
access
to
the
petitions,
to
participate
in
the
verification
process.
the
only
thing
the
public
can
do
is
have
--
observe
--
a
limited
number
of
observers.
these
observers
are
prohibited
from--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--that's
not
allowed
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
instructions
from
the
secretary
of
state
is
while
you
can
have
observers
to
observe
the
process,
the
people--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--there
is
absolutely
no
procedure
under
washington
statute
to
do
anything
with
that
information.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
nothing.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
one
of
--
one
of
the
intervenors
sought
an
exception
from
the
--
from
the
injunction,
which
we
did
not
object
to,
that
--
that
they
would
have
access
to
the
list.
but
under
confidentiality
and
protective
order--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--with
all
respect,
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
what
i
--
what
i
said
is
there's
no
role
for
the
public
in
verifying
signatures.
you
can
ask
for
judicial
review--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--the
only
thing
that
they
could
do
is
request
that
the
court
does
its
own
count.
in
other
words,
there's
judicial
review
available.
but
the
public
has
no
role
in
the
verification,
but
they
can
trigger
judicial
review.
and
then
the
court
conducts
its
own
count.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
an
adversary
process
in
which
people
come
in
and
present
evidence
of
--
of
people's
--
of
invalid
signatures.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
the
observers
can
observe
the
process,
and
if
they
feel--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
but--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
the
--
the
observer
--
under
the
washington
procedure,
observers
can
observe
the
process,
and
if
they
feel,
or
if
anyone
feels,
that
there
has
been
an
inadequate
job
in
--
in
verification,
then
they
can
ask
for
judicial
review.
and
then
the
court
conducts
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
there's
no
procedure
for
that.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that's
not
--
there's
no
procedure
for
that.
you
know,
if
they
wanted
to
involve
the
public
--
and
that's
the
difference,
i
said,
between
this
procedure
and
other
procedures.
they're
claiming
the
need
for
public
disclosure
so
the
public
can
be
involved
in
verification.
well,
there's
no
procedure--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--to
be
involved
in
verification.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
it's
possible,
but
we
think
this
information
is
marginal.
in
other
words,
the
--
it's
much
more
important--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
we
--
we
think
it's
a
--
a
very
marginal
interest.
the
ninth
circuit
recently
ruled
that
if
you
give
a
small
contribution
to
an
initiative,
there's
not
--
i
mean,
nobody
cares.
so
why
should
it
be
publicly
disclosed
when
it's
so
marginal?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
what
is
bad
is
not
the
criticism;
it's
the
public
--
it's
the
government
requiring
you
to
disclose
your
identity
and
beliefs.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
then
why
don't
they
require
both
sides?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
then
why
don't
they
require
both
sides
if
that
was
the
purpose?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
but
the
other
side--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--okay.
but
this
is
a
one-way
street.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia,
but
the
campaign
manager
of
this
initiative
had
his
family
sleep
in
his
living
room
because
of
the
threats--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--and
--
and--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--but
all
we're
asking
for
is
a
first
amendment
analysis
of
the
compelled
disclosure
of
the
identity
of
these
people
and
whether
or
not
these
interests
are
sufficient.
could
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you.
first
a
clarification
of
what
we
sought
in
the
preliminary
injunction.
we
were
--
we
sought
to
base
our
preliminary
injunction
on
both
count
1
and
count
2.
of
course,
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
reach
--
in
either
case
--
reach
count
2.
secondly,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there's
any
conduct
here,
i
don't
think
signing
a
written
statement
is
conduct.
and,
of
course,
by
signing
the
statement,
the
person
is
adopting
the
statement
on
the
petition,
one
of
which
involves
their
preference
on
the
referendum,
and
the
second
is
the
--
the
request
that
the
matter
goes
on
the
ballot.
and,
of
course,
it
has
no
legal
effect
unless
122,000
make
the
same
political
statement.
third,
evidence
of
harassment
comes
in,
as
in
citizens
united,
because
the
weight
of
the
interest
that
is
required
depends
upon
the
burden
of
the
first
amendment
--
to
the
first
amendment
speech
involved;
and
this
court
specifically
referred
in
citizens
united
to
the
lack
of
evidence
of
harassment
of
the
donors
that
might
occur
if
they
were
disclosed
through
the
reports
which
citizens
united
upheld.
here
we
do
have
evidence
of
