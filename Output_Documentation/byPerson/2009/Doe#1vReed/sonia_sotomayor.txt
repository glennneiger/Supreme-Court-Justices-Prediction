justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
separate
out
the
harassment
aspects
of
this
case
from
the
working
proposition
that
there's
some
sort
of
freedom
of
association,
of
privacy.
your
theory,
putting
harassment
aside,
would
invalidate
all
of
the
state
laws
that
require
disclosure
of
voter
registration
lists,
correct?
all
of
those
states
like
new
york
that
permit
public
review
of
voter
registration
lists
and
party
affiliations,
et
cetera
--
that's
illegal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
explain
to
me
the
difference.
and
--
well,
one
other
aspect
of
state
legislative
--
i
can
only
work
from
new
york
because
i
know
it
intimately,
but
it
is
a
state
that
also
permits
or
requires
that
petitions
for
candidate
listing
on
the
ballot
be
public
as
well.
new
york
relies
in
part,
as
this
state
does,
on
the
public
reviewing
those
petitions.
would
that
be
invalid
as
well,
for
a
candidate's
running?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
explain
to
me
what
the
difference
is
in
those
three
situations.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
with
--
with
the
state's
interest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
think
that
--
putting
aside
this
kind
of
referendum,
just
a
hypothetical
referendum
having
to
do
with
a
certain
tax
scheme
--
you
don't
think
the
voters
would
be
interested
in
knowing
what
kinds
of
people
in
what
occupations
are
interested
in
that
particular
tax
benefit
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
if
we
create
this
right
of
--
this
constitutional
right
of
association
in
the
manner
that
you
are
describing
it,
why
is
it
limited
to
the
voting
area?
would
we
be
inviting
review
if
a
group
of
citizens
get
together
and
send
a
letter
to
an
agency
that
says
please
pass
x
regulation,
or
rescind
y
regulation?
would
the
agency
be
prohibited
from
making
that
letter
public?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
--
you're
suggesting--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
when
a
petitioner
or
a
person
engages
in
political
discourse
with
the
government,
that
they
--
when
they
choose
to
do
it,
because
the
government
is
not
compelling
them
to
write
to
it;
it's
not
compelling
them
to
sign
the
referendum.
it's
just--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
it's
--
but
ms.
mcintyre
wasn't
asking
the
government
to
engage
its
process
in
her
favor.
she
was
asking
for
political
reform,
but
she
wasn't
asking
to
engage
the
government
process
on
her
behalf.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
weren't
two
of
the
petitioners
here
--
weren't
two
of
the
petitioners
here
seeking
the
list
so
that
they
could
go
over
the
certification
process
the
state
had
done
to
ensure
that
they
had
certified
all
the
right
people,
et
cetera?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
going
to
the
privacy
questions.
you
responded
to
justice
ginsburg
by
saying
that
there
was
no
way
to
challenge
the
state's
process
of
validation,
and
that
--
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
assuming
the
answer,
meaning
if
they
don't
have
the
right
to
access,
they
can't.
but,
legally,
they
can
challenge
it
if
they
find
on
the
petitions
that
things
were
erroneously
counted
by
the
state.
they
can
go
into
court
and
prove
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
much
time
are
we
talking
about
in
those
processes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
i'm
trying
to
get
the
relationship
between
the
disks
being
made
available
and
the
verification
process.
so
is
there
a
time
for
the
public
to
look
through
the
disks
before
the
people
who
are
sent
into
the
room
are
sent
into
the
room?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
proposition
8?
