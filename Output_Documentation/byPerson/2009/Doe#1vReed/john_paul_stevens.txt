there
another

public
interest?
would
it
be
a
legitimate
public
interest
to
say
i'd
like
to
know
who
signed
the
petition
because
i
would
like
to
try
to
persuade
them
that
their
views
should
be
modified?
is
there
a
public
interest
in
encouraging
debate
on
the
underlying
issue?

well,
it
does
identify
people
who
have
a
--
a
particular
point
of
view
on
a
public
issue.
and
if
you
had
the
other
point
of
view,
don't
you
have
an
interest
in
finding
out
who
you'd
like
to
convince
to
change
their
minds?
