justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
about
requiring
disclosure
of
campaign
contributions?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
why
doesn't
that
fall
within
your
principle
that
no
person
should
be
exposed
to
criticism
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--his
political
beliefs?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bopp,
do
you
have
any
case
in
which
we
have
held
that
the
first
amendment
applies
to
activity
that
consists
of
the
process
of
legislation,
of
legislating--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
of
adopting
legislation?
what
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--soliciting
signatures
is
not
taking
part
in
the
process
of
legislating.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
person
who
requests
a
referendum
is
taking
--
when
there's
a
certain
number
of
signatures
required
to
achieve
it,
is
taking
part
in
that.
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
for
the
first
century
of
our
existence,
even
voting
was
public
--
you
either
did
it
raising
your
hand
or
by
voice,
or
later,
you
had
a
ballot
that
was
very
visibly
red
or
blue
so
that
people
knew
which
party
you
were
voting
for
--
the
fact
is
that
running
a
democracy
takes
a
certain
amount
of
civic
courage.
and
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
you
from
criticism
or
even
nasty
phone
calls
when
you
exercise
your
political
rights
to
legislate
or
to
take
part
in
the
legislative
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
asking
us
to
enter
into
a
whole
new
field
where
we've
never
gone
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
even
just
your
name,
so
they
can
check
that
this
thing
isn't
phony
and
that
all
the
names
on
it
aren't
--
aren't
made
up
by
one
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
they
can.
so
they
can
get
your
name,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
objecting
to
the
public
being
able
to
check
whether
the
agency
is
indeed
finding
out
whether
this
is
a
genuine
petition
or
not,
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
you
have
some
options,
too?
have
you
started
a
referendum
to
repeal
the
--
the
california
law
that
requires
disclosure?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
i
thought
that's
what
you're
challenging.
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
washington.
i
got
the
wrong
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
people
of
washington
--
the
people
washington
evidently
think
that
this
is
not
too
much
of
an
imposition
upon
people's
courage,
to
--
to
stand
up
and
sign
something
and
be
willing
to
stand
behind
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
you
don't
like
that,
i
can
see
doing
it
another
way.
but
--
but
the
people
of
washington
have
chosen
to
do
it
this
--
this
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
that
the
first
amendment
absolutely
forbids
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
proving
my
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
have
been
a
good
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
just
--
just
--
what
about
just
wanting
to
know
their
names
so
you
can
criticize
them?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
--
is
that
such
a
bad
thing
in
a
democracy?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
part
of
the
reason
is
so
you
can
be
out
there
and
be
responsible
for
the
positions
you've
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
people
--
people
can
criticize
you
for
the
position
you
have
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
"both
sides"?
the
other
side
hasn't
signed
anything.
when
they
sign
something--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
when
they
sign
something,
they'll
be
out
there
for
public
criticism
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
this
is
such
a
touchy-feely,
oh,
so
sensitive
about
--
about
any--
[laughter]
you
know,
you
can't
run
a
democracy
this
way,
with
everybody
being
afraid
of
having
his
political
positions
known.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
bad.
the
threats
should
be
moved
against
vigorously--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
just
because
there
can
be
criminal
activity
doesn't
mean
that
you
--
you
have
to
eliminate
a
procedure
that
is
otherwise
perfectly
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
country
was
acting
unconstitutionally
for
a
whole
century
before
we
adopted
the
australian
secret
ballot?
do
you
really
think
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it
was
unconstitutional--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
a
whole
century
not
to
have
a
secret
ballot?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
--
you
would
have
no
objection
to
as
an-applied
challenge
to
disclosing
the
names
of
individuals
to
a
particular
cause,
where
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
opponents
of
that
cause
are
violent
and
will
do
violence
to
the
people
who
signed
the
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
is
just
a
general
challenge
to
ever,
ever
disclosing
the
names
of
petition
signers?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
you
--
you've
rejected
that
here.
you've
said
there's
no
evidence
here
that
any
of
the
petition
--
petition
signers
were
subjected
to
any
harassment.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
there
isn't,
because
the
names
haven't
gotten
out
yet.
how
could
you
possibly
demonstrate
before
the
names
get
out
that
petition
signers
are
going
to
be
subjected
to
harassment?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
otherwise,
don't
insist
upon
evidence
that
these
very
petition
signers
will
be
harassed.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
would
be
an
acceptable
type
of
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
don't
think
it's
acceptable,
then
--
then
--
then
you're
not
making
an
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes
the
public
may
not
trust
the
secretary
of
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
--
it
may
be
an
issue
in
which
his
administration
has
taken
a
particularly
firm
stand,
and
the
public
may
not
trust
the
job
that
the
secretary
of
state
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
trust
but
verify
--
i
like
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
information,
at
least
the
names
of
those
people
--
isn't
it
probably
public
information
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
it
be
obtained
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
in
this
case?
