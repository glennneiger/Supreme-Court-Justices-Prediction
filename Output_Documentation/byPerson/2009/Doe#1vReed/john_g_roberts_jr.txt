chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
09-559,
john
doe
v.
reed,
washington
secretary
of
state.
mr.
bopp.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
go
ahead
and
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
counsel,
the
responses
you
have
given
to
a
couple
of
the
questions
has
been
that
the
first
amendment
analysis
would
apply.
but
given
you
have
a
facial
challenge,
is
that
enough?
don't
you
have
to
indicate
that
the
first
amendment
analysis
would
prevail
in
either
all
of
the
other
cases,
most
of
the
other
cases,
a
significant
portion?
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
and
if
the
challenge
is
going
to
fail
in
some
of
those
other
cases,
i
think
your
facial
challenge
fails
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
have
to
decide,
in
assessing
your
claim
that,
no
matter
what
the
referendum
issue
was,
that
there's
a
significant
intrusion
on
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if,
for
example,
the
referendum
involves
a
bond
issue
as
to
which
people
may
have
particular
views,
but
they're
not
going
to
get
terribly
excited
about
it,
we'd
still
have
to
say
that
that's
protected
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
my
point
is,
though,
you're
not
likely
to
get
that
with
respect
to,
you
know,
a
debt
issue,
raising
the
debt
ceiling
from
0.8
percent
to
0.9
percent.
you're
not
going
to
get
a
crowd
outside
your
house
because
you
signed
that
petition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
the
--
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
washington
decided
that,
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
protect
minorities.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bopp.
general
mckenna.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
these
records--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel,
if
the
state
had
a
law
that
you
could
disclose
voters
and
for
whom
they
voted,
would
that
implicate
first
amendment
interests?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
would
the
first
amendment
interests
be?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
having
your
name
revealed
on
a
petition
of
this
sort
might
have
a
chilling
effect
on
whether
you
sign
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
think
revealing
that
you're
a
voter
has
the
same
chilling
effect
as
revealing
how
you
voted,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
told
me
that
the
first
amendment
interests
were
implicated
with
respect
to
the
secret
ballot,
that
you
couldn't
require
people
to
reveal
how
they
voted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
was
that
they
can
bring
an
as-applied
challenge.
now,
that
as-applied
challenge
would
be
small
comfort
unless
the
names
were
protected
pending
the
resolution
of
that
challenge,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
a
stay
should
be
granted
in
this
case
to
allow
the
petitioners
to
pursue
an
as-applied
challenge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
that
the
disclosure
of
the
names,
pending
the
resolution
of
their
as-applied
challenge,
would
subject
them
to
incidents
of
violence
and
intimidation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
evidence
--
there's
no
evidence
of
episodes
of
violence
or
intimidation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what's
the
most
sensitive
similar
petition
for
a
referendum?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
what's
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what's
--
what's
the
other
one
that's
going
to
get
people
--
that's
the
most
controversial
public
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
in
washington,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
the
referendum
in
favor
or
opposed
to
assisted
suicide?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
percentage
--
what
percentage
of
the
people
who
signed
this
petition
to
put
this
law
on
the
referendum
do
you
think
signed
it
because
they
think
these
sort
of
things
should
be
generally
put
to
a
public
vote
as
opposed
to
because
they
opposed
the
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
as
much
as
20
percent
of
the
people
who
signed
this
petition
are
actually
in
favor
of
the
law
that
it's
aimed
to
repeal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
one
of
the
reasons
you
wanted
to
do
this
was
so
people
would
have
information
that
would
allow
them
to
participate
in
the
civic
process,
and
there
are
people
who
--
might
think
it
makes
a
difference
whether
a
referendum
was
requested
by
--
primarily
by
members
of
a
particular
ethnic
group
or
not.
so
isn't
--
doesn't
--
i
thought
your
brief
would
say
the
state
has
an
interest
in
that
type
of
disclosure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
they--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--how
can
they
find
that
out
with
just
the
name
and
address,
that
a
large
number
of
people
from
a
company
signed
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
put
on
who
you
work
for,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
still
on
the
companies.
how
--
how
does
knowing
who
the
sponsors
are
tell
you
how
many
people
from
a
particular
company
signed
the
petition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
mckenna.
mr.
bopp,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bopp.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
09-559,
doe
versus
reed.
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
washington
allows
citizens
to
challenge
state
laws
by
referendum.
for
a
proposed
referendum
to
make
it
onto
the
ballot
more
than
a
120,000
washington
voters
must
sign
a
referendum
petition
requesting
that
the
law
be
put
to
a
vote
of
the
people.
under
washington
law
petition
signers
must
also
list
there
address
and
the
county
in
which
they
are
registered
to
vote
or
their
signature
will
not
count.
after
gathering
the
signatures
the
referendum
proponent
files
the
petition
with
the
secretary
of
state
who
determines
whether
the
petition
has
an
enough
valid
signatures
to
put
the
referendum
on
the
ballot.
the
washington
public
records
act
authorizes
private
parties
to
obtain
copies
of
government
documents
and
the
state
construes
that
act
to
cover
submitted
referendum
petitions.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
state
law
that
was
passed
to
extend
certain
benefits
to
same-sex
couples.
a
group
of
citizens
circulated
a
petition
to
challenge
that
law.
more
than
137,000
washington
voters
signed
the
petition
and
the
referendum
which
was
labeled
r-71
qualified
for
the
november
2009
ballot.
the
voters
ultimately
approved
the
state
law
by
a
vote
of
53%
to
47%.
now
several
groups
including
the
respondents
here
invoked
the
washington
public
records
act
to
obtain
copies
of
the
r-71
petition
which
of
course
included
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
signers.
certain
petition
signers
and
the
petition
sponsor
objected
arguing
that
disclosure
would
violate
their
first
amendment
rights.
the
petition
signers
made
two
arguments.
first
they
argued
that
releasing
identifying
information
on
any
petition
would
violate
the
first
amendment.
second
they
argued
that
releasing
the
signatory
information
on
their
particular
petition
would
violate
the
first
amendment
because
releasing
that
information
would
subject
them
to
threats,
harassment
and
reprisals
for
their
support
of
the
referendum.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
addressed
only
plaintiff's
first
argument,
the
more
general
one
applicable
to
all
petitions
and
that
is
the
only
argument
that
is
before
us
in
this
case.
the
plaintiff's
second
argument
the
one
that
is
specific
to
their
referendum
petition
is
still
pending
before
the
district
court.
the
state
contends
that
we
can
quickly
dispose
of
the
plaintiff's
case
because
no
first
amendment
interest
is
at
â€“
no
first
amendment
interest
at
all
is
implicated
by
the
act
of
signing
the
petition.
signing
a
petition
the
state
argues
is
part
of
the
legislative
process
not
subject
to
analysis
under
the
first
amendment.
we
disagree.
an
individual
expresses
a
view
on
a
political
matter
when
he
signs
a
petition.
in
most
cases
the
individual's
signature
will
express
the
view
that
the
law
subject
to
the
petition
should
be
overturned,
but
even
if
the
signer
is
uncertain
about
how
he
would
vote
on
the
merits
of
the
underlying
law,
his
signatures
still
expresses
the
political
view
that
the
question
should
be
considered
by
the
whole
electorate.
in
either
case
the
expression
of
a
political
view
implicates
a
first
amendment
right.
the
state
therefore
must
justify
the
disclosure
requirement
by
showing
that
it
is
substantially
related
to
a
sufficiently
important
government
interest.
as
we
have
said
in
our
precedents
the
strength
of
the
government
interest
must
reflect
the
seriousness
of
the
actual
burden
on
first
amendment
rights.
the
state
argues
that
its
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
its
electoral
process
justifies
the
burdens
imposed
by
compelled
disclosure
under
the
public
records
act.
the
plaintiffs
argue
that
disclosure
is
not
necessary
to
serve
that
interest
because
state
law
already
provides
a
number
of
measures
that
will
serve
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process,
but
we
agree
with
the
state
public
disclosure
helps
promote
the
state's
interest
in
ways
other
existing
measures
do
not.
now
the
plaintiffs'
more
significant
objection
is
that
even
if
the
state's
interest
in
election
integrity
is
important,
the
strength
of
that
governmental
interest
does
not
commensurate
with
the
seriousness
of
the
actual
burden
imposed
on
their
first
amendment
rights.
according
to
the
plaintiffs,
the
objective
of
those
seeking
disclosure
of
the
r-71
petition
is
not
to
prevent
fraud
and
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process,
but
to
publicly
identify
those
who
had
validly
signed
the
petition
to
broadcast
the
signer's
political
views
on
the
subject
of
the
petition.
the
plaintiffs
allege
for
example
that
certain
groups
plan
to
post
a
petitions
in
searchable
form
on
the
internet
and
then
encourage
other
citizens
to
seek
out
the
r-71
signers.
once
on
the
internet
plaintiffs
fear
that
their
names
and
addresses
will
be
combined
with
publicly
available
phone
numbers
and
maps,
in
what
will
turn
out
to
be
a
blueprint
for
harassment
and
intimidation.
now
in
related
context
we
have
recognized
that
those
resisting
disclosure
can
prevail
under
the
first
amendment
if
they
can
show
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
compelled
disclosure
of
personal
information
will
subject
them
to
threats,
harassment
or
reprisals
from
either
government
officials
or
private
parties.
the
question
before
us
however
is
not
whether
disclosure
violates
the
first
amendment
with
respect
to
those
who
signed
the
r-71
petition
in
particular
or
other
controversial
petitions.
the
question
instead
is
whether
such
disclosure
in
general
violates
the
first
amendment
rights
of
those
who
signed
referendum
petitions.
remember
that
we
are
considering
only
the
plaintiffs
first
argument
the
one
that
applies
to
all
petitions
and
not
their
second
argument
which
is
about
their
particular
petition.
the
problem
for
the
plaintiffs
is
that
their
general
argument
rests
almost
entirely
on
the
specific
harm
they
say
would
attend
disclosure
of
the
information
on
the
r-71
petition
or
on
similarly
controversial
ones.
the
typical
referendum
petitions
involved
much
more
mundane
issues,
issues
like
tax
policy,
general
revenue
measures
or
land-use
regulations.
now
voters
of
course
care
about
those
issues,
some
passionately
but
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
any
burdens
imposed
by
disclosure
of
such
typical
referendum
petitions
would
be
remotely
like
the
burdens
plaintiffs
fear
in
this
case.
faced
with
the
state's
unrebutted
arguments
that
only
modest
burdens
attend
the
disclosure
of
the
typical
petition,
we
must
reject
plaintiffs
brought
challenge
to
the
disclosure.
in
doing
so
we
notice
we
have
in
other
election
disclosure
cases
that
upholding
the
law
against
a
broad-based
challenge
does
not
foreclose
a
litigant's
success
in
a
narrow
one.
the
secretary
of
state
has
acknowledged
that
plaintiffs
may
press
there
never
were
challenge
with
respect
to
the
release
of
r-71
signatory
information
in
proceedings
that
are
currently
pending
before
the
district
court.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
eight
members
of
the
court
agreed
with
that
judgment.
justices
kennedy,
ginsburg,
breyer,
alito
and
sotomayor
join
the
opinion
i've
just
described.
justices
breyer
and
alito
have
also
filed
concurring
opinions.
justice
sotomayor
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
join.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
