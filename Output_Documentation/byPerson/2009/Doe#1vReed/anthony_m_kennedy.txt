justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you,
could
the
opponents
of
a
particular
ballot
measure
organize
a
boycott
for
--
and
picket
businesses
whose
managers
had
supported
that
boycott?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
had
supported
that
initiative?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that's
so,
then
under
claiborne
hardware,
which
i
--
i
notice
you
didn't
cite
in
your
brief,
but
if
--
if
that's
so,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state's
--
or
that
--
that
the
signers'
interest
in
keeping
their
names
private
is
somewhat
diminished.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
first
amendment
activity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
so
justice
alito's
question
points
out
that
this
would
be
a
very
slim
basis
upon
which
to
rest
a
holding
in
your
favor.
and
just
to
go
back
to
the
line
of
questions
of
the
first,
the
state
of
california
has
very
complicated
referendum
and
initiative
matters.
don't
you
think
it's
relevant
for
the
public
to
know
that,
say,
a
public
employees
union
had
paid
solicitors
to
put
those
signatures
on
the
ballot,
or
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
or
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
had
paid
solicitors
to
put
this
on
the
ballot?
isn't
that
part
of
assessing
the
--
the
reasons
why
this
initiative
was
proposed?
and
isn't
that
vital
to
the
voters
--
to
the
voter
in
making
an
informed
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me,
but
the
point
is,
isn't
--
isn't
there
an
interest
in
knowing
this
information?
not
--
not
that
it's
paid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we'll
leave
that
out.
but
--
but
to
know
that
--
that
--
the
persons
that
supported
the
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that
pursuant
to
the
public
records
act
that
we're
talking
about--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
was
that
part
of
the
initiative
and
referendum
structure
before
the
public
records
act
was
passed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
all
right.
so
this
--
the
public
record
--
pardon
me.
the
--
in
california,
we
call
it
an
initiative
and
referendum
process
--
existed
and
was
in
place
before
the
public
records
act
added
this
additional
feature
of
disclosure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
was
a
judgment
at
one
time
by
the
state
of
washington
that
it
didn't
--
that
it
didn't
need
the
public
records
disclosure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
a
business
boycott?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
a
business
boycott?
suppose
that
were
a
--
a
likely
outcome
of
disclosing
the
name?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
will
likely
be
controlled
by
our
first
amendment
precedents,
because
that's
the
most
fully
developed.
did
you
look
at
the
petition
clause
at
all?
in
the
early
days
of
the
republic,
the
petitions
were
the
way
in
which
you
communicated
with
your
legislator.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
tried
to
look
it
up.
i
have
a
recollection,
but
i'm
not
sure,
that
those
petitions
were
sometimes
put
in
the
congressional
record.
but
did
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
petition
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
of
course,
that
can
cut
the
other
way,
too,
because
then
it's
more
like
a
vote.
and
there
--
there
is
strong
interest
in
keeping
the
--
the
vote
private.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
--
do
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
--
do
you
make
the
contention
before
us
that
the
secretary
of
state
and
those
who
assist
it
are
not
capable
of
determining
whether
the
petition
signatures
are
valid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
without
public
disclosure?
