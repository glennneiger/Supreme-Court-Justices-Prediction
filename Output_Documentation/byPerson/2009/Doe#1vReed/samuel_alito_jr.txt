justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.
bopp,
if
a
voter
--
if
the
legislature
passes
a
statute
and
someone
is
--
is
satisfied
with
that
statute,
how
likely
is
it
that
that
person
is
going
to
sign
a
petition
to
have
a
referendum
to
see
whether
the
statute
should
be
blocked?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
possible--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
if
you
were
in
the
real
world,
if
you
were
to
poll
the
people
who
sign
a
referendum
petition
with
respect
to
a
statute
that
was
passed
by
the
state
legislature,
what
percentage
do
you
think
would
be
opposed
to
that
legislation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
to
follow
up
on
justice
sotomayor's
question,
do
you
think
an
agency
could
say,
if
you
want
to
comment
on
proposed
--
on
a
proposed
rule,
you
have
to
disclose
to
us
your
name
and
your
address
and
your
telephone
number
and
your
political
affiliation,
and
all
sorts
of
--
your
marital
status
and
your
income
level
and
all
sorts
of
other
demographic
information?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
they
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--in
the
last
questions--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
i'd
like
to
know
how
far
you
--
you
are
--
you
want
to
go.
you
say
in
your
brief
that
the
availability
of
the
referendum
signature
petitions
allows
washington
voters
to
engage
in
discussion
of
referred
measures
with
persons
whose
acts
secured
the
election
and
suspension
of
state
law.
so
would
--
would
it
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
to
require
anybody
who
signs
a
petition
to
put
down
not
just
the
person's
name
and
address,
but
also
telephone
number,
so
that
they
could
be
engaged
in
a
conversation
about
what
they
had
done?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
that
you
were
saying
that
one
of
the
interests
that's
served
by
this
is
to
allow
people
who
--
to
allow
washington
citizens
to
discuss
this
matter
with
those
who
signed
the
petition.
so
putting
down
the
telephone
number
would
assist
them
in
doing
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
would--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
would
endorse
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
asking
the
policy
question.
i'm
asking
whether
the
first
amendment
would
permit
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
one
of
your
co-respondents
says
that
supplying
this
information
provides
insight
whether
support
comes
predominantly
from
members
of
particular
political
or
religious
organizations.
would
it
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
to
require
anybody
who
signs
a
petition
to
list
the
person's
religion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
say
somebody
is
thinking
of
circulating
a
petition
on
a
sensitive
subject
and
fears
that
people
may
be
dissuaded
from
signing
because
they
fear
retaliation.
at
what
point
could
they
bring
this
as-applied
challenge?
do
they
have
to
--
could
they
do
it
before
they
even
begin
to
circulate
the
petition,
arguing
that
if
--
if
these
names
--
if
people
are
not
assured
ahead
of
time
that
their
name
and
address
is
not
going
to
be
revealed
to
the
public
on
the
internet,
they're
not
going
to
sign
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
how
would
they--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--how
would
they
prove
that
there's
--
that
there's
a
--
a
threat,
a
sufficient
threat
of
harassment
in
that
particular
case,
before
the
petition
is
even
signed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
hypothetical
is
that
before
this
petition
is
circulated,
the
supporters
came
into
court,
and
they
said:
look
what
has
happened
in
california
with
--
with
proposition
8.
don't
disclose
--
enter
an
order
prohibiting
the
public
disclosure
of
the
names
and
addresses
here.
would
that
be
sufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
it
seems
to
me
your
--
the
strongest
state
interest
here
is
detecting
fraud.
and
you
mentioned
that
the
records
are
digitized.
and
maybe
you
can
correct
my
impression
of
this,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
records
are
digitized,
there
are
very
simple
ways
of
detecting
fraud
that
would
not
require
the
disclosure
of
the
list
to
the
public.
if
somebody
wants
to
see
whether
his
or
her
name
has
been
fraudulently
put
on
the
list,
wouldn't
it
be
very
simple
to
set
up
a
web
site
where
the
person
could
put
in
a
little
bit
of
identifying
information
and
see
whether
that
person's
name
is
on
the
list?
and
if
the
--
the
purpose
is
to
see
whether
a
particular
person
lives
at
a
particular
address,
couldn't
you
just
cross-reference
by
means
of
a
computer
program
the
information
on
the
referendum
with
the
--
with
the
voting
lists?
so
if
you've
got
john
jones
who
lives
at
10
main
street,
you
see
whether
there
really
is
a
registered
voter
john
jones
who
lives
at
10
main
street?
why
does
this
all
have
to
be
put
out
on
the
internet?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
couldn't
you
--
couldn't
this
be
done
very
simply?
if
i
want
to
see
whether
somebody
has
fraudulently
signed
my
name,
very
quickly
go
to
a
web
site,
wouldn't
be
expensive
to
set
up,
put
in
your
voter
id
number,
and
see
whether
--
and
your
name,
and
see
whether
you're
on
the
--
on
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--whether
you
--
somebody
signed
your
name
to
the
petition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
--
to
finish
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
what
is
the
non-speech
component
of
signing
a
petition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what's
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
the
non-speech
component?
when
you
--
when
you
talk
about
the
vote
cast
by
an
elected
representative,
of
course,
there's
a
strong
interest
in
knowing
how
an
elected
representative
voted,
because
the
representative
is
answerable
to
the
voters.
but
somebody
who
signs
a
petition
isn't
answerable
to
anybody
--
any
other
citizen.
so
what's
your
interest?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
the
fraud
interest?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
but
how
far
does
that
go?
when
i
asked
whether
you
could
--
you
want
to
know
the
religion
of
the
people
who
signed,
no,
you
can't
do
that.
how
much
more
demographic
information
could
be
--
could
be
--
does
the
--
does
the
state
of
washington
have
an
interest
in
making
publicly
available
about
the
people
who
support
this
election?
let's
say
it's
--
it's
a
referendum
about
immigration.
does
the
state
of
washington
have
an
interest
in
providing
information
to
somebody
who
says
i
want
to
know
how
many
people
with
hispanic
names
signed
this,
or
how
many
people
with
asian
names
signed
this?
is
that
--
that
what
you
want
to
facilitate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
i
don't
understand
what
information
is
being
--
what
information
you
think
you're
providing
to
the
public.
outside
of
the
fraud
area,
if
i
see
that
john
jones
from
seattle
signed
this
petition,
that
tells
me
absolutely
nothing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
know,
if
somebody
called
your
office
and
said
i'd
like
the
--
the
home
address
of
all
the
attorneys
who
work
in
the
attorney
general's
office
because
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
go
to
their
homes
and
have
uncomfortable
conversations
with
them--
[laughter]
--which
is
what
has
been
alleged
here,
would
you
release
that
information?
