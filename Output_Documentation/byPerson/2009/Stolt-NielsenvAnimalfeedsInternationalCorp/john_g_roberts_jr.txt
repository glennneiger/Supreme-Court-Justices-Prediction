chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
08-1198,
stolt-nielsen
s.a.
v.
animalfeeds
international.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
ms.
pillard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
a
critical
difference,
though?
i
mean,
i
understood
the
fundamental
question
in
--
before
getting
arbitration
is
whether
the
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
this
dispute
with
this
party.
and
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
contract
permitted
this
sort
of
arbitration;
it's
another
thing
to
say
it
didn't
preclude
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
it
didn't
preclude,
the
contract
may
not
preclude
--
if
i
agree
--
i
guess
it's
the
--
well,
if
i
agree
to
arbitrate
with
a,
it
doesn't
preclude
me
from
arbitrating
with
b,
but
nothing
in
the
agreement
compels
me
to
do
that.
so
which
did
the
arbitrators
do?
did
they
say,
under
this
contract,
you
agreed
to
a
class
action
treatment,
in
the
sense
that
--
whether
it's
the
language
or
the
intent
or
whatever
--
or
did
they
say
we
don't
find
anything
here
that
precludes
class
action
treatment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
show
me
this
--
i
see
they
have
quoted
from--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--from
the
agreement.
where
is
that
in
the
agreement
itself?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
know
offhand.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
is
--
i'm
sorry.
this
is
what
i
was
wondering.
it
is,
of
course,
any
dispute
arising
from
--
blah,
blah
--
performance,
termination
of
this
charter
party
shall
be
settled
in
new
york.
now,
there's
--
the
class
is
not
a
party
to
this
charter
party.
so
disputes
arising
from
this
charter
party
doesn't
involve
the
class.
so
they
did
not
agree
to
arbitrate
with
the
class.
now,
as
i
understand
what
the
arbitrators
did,
they
said,
well,
they
didn't
preclude
it,
and
so
we
get
to
decide
how
far
our
authority
goes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now
--
now
--
i'm
sorry.
i'm
just
reading
along
here.
they
rejected
your
argument
about
"forbids",
but
the
--
they
go
on
to
say:
the
issue
--
we
look
at
this,
we
look
at
that
to
see
whether
they
intended
to
permit
or
to
preclude
class
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
enough
for
them
if
the
parties
did
not
intend
to
preclude
class
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
--
in
any
--
in
any
case
--
when
you
say
"arbitrators'
toolbox",
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
if
that
is
something
different
than
what
the
parties
agreed
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
just
saying
that
they're
--
they're
giving
up
a
lot.
this
is
the
basic
reason
that
you
require,
i
thought,
fairly
clear
language
that
you
are
agreeing
to
arbitrate.
they
are
giving
up
their
right
to
go
into
court.
they
have
an
agreement
between
a
and
b
that
they
will
arbitrate
a
dispute,
and
they
say
you
are
giving
up
your
right
to
go
to
court
with
the
dispute
between
a
and
c.
and
the
"any
dispute"
language
that
you're,
you
know,
quite
understandably
relying
on
refers
to
any
dispute
arising
from
the
--
making
performance
or
termination
of
"this
charter
party".
"this
charter
party"
says
nothing
about
arbitrating
with
c.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
but
they
can
agree
to
arbitrate.
they
can
agree
to
arbitrate
with
some
and
not
with
others,
even
if
it's
the
same
contract.
they
may
decide
that
your
client
is
a
very
reasonable
person;
they
are
happy
to
submit
that
to
arbitration.
or
it's
a
very
big
and
important
client,
and
they
don't
want
to
get
into
court
with
you.
they
may
decide
some
other
party,
for
whatever
reason,
they
don't
want
to
get
dragged
into
court
with
them.
same
charter
party,
different
--
different
parties--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
different
results.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
allowing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
allowing.
see,
that's
where
i
get
hung
up.
there's
a
difference
in
arbitration
--
and
it's
a
fundamental
difference
--
between
allowing
something
and
a
background
rule
that
requires
it
if
you
don't
say
anything
about
it.
the
difference
i
see
with
the
hypothetical
justice
breyer
put
is
that
you
are
talking
about
the
details
of
a
contract
once
it's
agreed
there
is
a
contract.
there's
a
contract
that
governs
the
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
employee,
and
you're
trying
to
figure
out
if
it
says
anything
about
where
they
eat
lunch.
this
is
the
much
more
fundamental
issue
of
whether
you've
even
agreed
to
arbitrate
with
this
person.
is
this
guy
your
employee
or
just
somebody
who
came
in
off
the
street?
and
i
think
what
your
brother's
position
is,
is
that
this
is
just
somebody
who
came
off
the
street;
the
class
members.
i
didn't
agree
to
do
anything
with
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
--
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
--
that's
what
it
comes
down--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
what
it
comes
down
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--whether
it's
an
interpretation
of
the
contract
to
give
the
arbitrators
the
authority
to
proceed
on
a
class
basis.
not
enough,
right,
under
your
view,
if
there's
nothing
in
there
that
precludes
them
from
doing
so?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
--
what
happens--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
happens
if
you
get
the
arbitrator
on
the
stand,
and
he
says:
as
we
read
the
contract,
it
doesn't
say
--
and
nothing
about
the
intent
of
the
parties
leads
me
to
believe
they
meant
--
you
may
arbitrate
this
on
a
class
basis,
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
says
you
may
not.
and
i
looked
at
the
intent
of
the
parties
and
background
rules,
and
nothing
there
says
you
may
not.
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
answer?
can
they
proceed
on
a
class
basis
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
it's
the
background
rule--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--under
which
you
should
interpret
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
have
to
decide,
when
we
--
when
the
contract
says
nothing
about
class
actions,
whether
the
background
rule
should
be
you
can
go
ahead
--
or
the
background
rule
should
be
you
can't
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
the
arbitrators
have
already
told
us
--
i
think
you
disagree
with
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
take
it
for
purposes
of
argument.
what
the
arbitrators
have
told
us
is
that
it
doesn't
say
anything.
it
doesn't
say
you
can
do
it,
it
doesn't
say
you
can't
do
it.
i
assume
that's
true.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
i
said
she
doesn't
agree
with
it.
but,
i
mean,
assuming
that's
true,
what's
the
answer?
yes
or
no?
can
they
go
ahead
with
class
action
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
you
and
i
have
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
if
you
and
i
have
a
contract
--
you're
going
to
sell
me
a
car,
and
we
write
up
a
contract
and
we
enter
into
it,
and
it
provides
for
arbitration
if
we
have
a
dispute.
i
also
buy
a
car
from
mr.
waxman,
and
i
xerox
that
contract.
it's
the
exact
same
contract.
we
have
a
dispute,
and
we
go
to
arbitration.
can
mr.
waxman
come
in
and
say,
i
got
the
same
contract,
and
i've
got
the
same
dispute.
arbitrate
with
me,
too?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
now,
suppose
i
have
a
contract
just
with
you
and
--
to
arbitrate
--
or
i
--
i
have
the
same
contract
with
mr.
waxman,
but
it
has
no
arbitration
clause.
and
he
says,
well,
the
dispute
is
the
same,
you
are
arbitrating
that,
can
i
come
in,
too,
and
get
bound
by
your
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
say
no.
and
the
reason
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
that
i
--
he
doesn't
have
any
arbitration
agreement
with
me
or
that
it's
not
the
same
arbitration
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
say
the
intent
is
pertinent
when
we
enter
into
the
contract,
okay?
and
there's
good
evidence
about
what
you
and
i
meant
the
contract
to
mean,
and
there's
not
any
evidence
about
what
mr.
waxman
and
i
meant
the
contract
to
mean.
say
we've
got
an
arbitration
clause
in
both
cases.
can
we
arbitrate
--
can
i
be
required
to
arbitrate
mr.
waxman's
contract
with
--
along
with
the
one
that
you
and
i
have
entered
into?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman,
why
don't
you
take
2
minutes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-769
stolt-nielsen
versus
animal
feeds
international.
