ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
the
arbitrators
did
here
was
interpret
the
contract
as
the
parties
asked
them
to.
they
did
not
impose
their
own
policy
judgment.
and
any
judicial
review
is
under
very
deferential
faa
standards
under
section
10,
which
is
confined
to
correcting
what
amount
to
gross
defects
in
the
process.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
okay.
petitioners'
position
rests
on
a
misinterpretation
of
what
the
arbitrators
did.
and
if
you
look
at
page
59
of
the
petition
appendix,
mr.
waxman
already
read
to
you
the
language
that
the
arbitrators
understood
they
must
look
to
the
language
of
the
parties'
agreement
to
ascertain
the
parties'
intention.
and
then
the
next
key
part
is
on
page
50a,
which
is
a
little
terse,
but
let's
say--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--50a,
the
next
page
of
the
petition
appendix.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
no.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
49a
was
where--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--the
arbitrators
described
their
methodology,
which
is
standard
contract
methodology:
to
look
to
the
parties'
agreement,
to
ascertain
the
parties'
intention,
whether
they
intended
to
permit--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--or
preclude--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--class
action.
so
they
have
set
up--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--that's
right.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
the
former.
and
let
me
point
you
to
--
on
page
50,
what
they
relied
on
was
the
broad
language
of
the
agreement,
the
language
"any
disputes".
and
in
particular,
they
drew
on
the
breadth
of
that
language
and
on
the
fact
that
many
other
arbitrators
had
read
similar
language
to
permit
class
arbitration.
and
so
those
other--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--yes.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
the
"any
disputes"--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--language?
in
the
agreement
itself?
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
is
--
the
agreement
is
reproduced
in
appendix
f
of
the
petition
appendix,
which
starts
on
page
67a,
and
the
arbitration
clause
is
on
page
69a.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
arbitrators
rejected
the
notion
that
they
should
permit--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--i'd
like
to
address
that
directly,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
arbitrators
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
they
should
adopt
as
--
as
a
default
rule.
and
that's
on
page
49a.
where
we
had
actually
argued
that
they
should,
they
rejected
our
argument.
claimants
argue
that
bazzle
requires
clear
language
that
forbids
class
arbitration
in
order
to
bar
it;
the
panel,
however,
agrees
with
respondent.
so
they
are
saying:
we
are
not
going
to
do
this
based
on
a
default
rule;
we
are
going
to
do
this
based
on
the
language
and
intent.
right?
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
right.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
--
i
respectfully
disagree.
they
go
on
and
they
read
any
disputes
to
authorize
--
now,
it's
not
to
require
class
action.
i
think
it's
important
that
that
be
clear.
it's
to
put
the
class
action
mechanism
--
or,
to
read
the
contract,
that
the
class
action
mechanism
is
in
the
arbitrators'
toolbox.
it's
something
that's
available.
it's
not
necessarily
going
to
happen,
but
it's
something
that's
available.
so
it's
part
of
a
delegation
to
the
arbitrators
of
authority
to
choose
procedures.
now--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--no,
by
agreeing
to
arbitrate
any
disputes,
the
arbitrators
found
that
they
were
given
the
authority
to
use
class
arbitration,
among
other
procedures,
if
they
were
appropriate
in
the
particular
case.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
that's
right.
i'd
like
to
point
to
two
aspects
of
the
opinion
that
i
think
clarify
this.
the
one
is
their
reference
to
the
language
on
page
50a,
the
panel
is
--
and
they
are
talking
about
the
language
in
the
context
of
the
other
arbitration
precedent,
or
the
other
arbitration
opinions
that
had
developed
at
that
point
under
the
aaa
arbitration
scheme.
and
they
are
saying
the
--
they
find
that
the
broad
wording
"any
dispute"
to
be
significant,
and
the
fact
that
other
arbitrators
looking
at
that
language
also
found
"any
dispute"
to
encompass
the
choice
of
this
procedure.
now,
i
think
it
was
justice
alito--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--and
it's
our
contention
--
and
i
think
it's
clear
--
that
they
found
that
it
was
permitted.
and
when
you
see
that
following--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--the
--
the
broad
wording,
the
"any
dispute"
--
now,
they
reject
the
notion
--
they
expressly
have
rejected
the
notion
that
they
are
supposed
to
do
it
as
a
matter
of
default.
and
then
i
just
want
to
address
this
language,
which
i
think
could
be
confusing,
at
the
bottom
of
51a,
where
they
say
they
don't
establish
that
the
parties
--
this
is
the
last
paragraph
on
51a:
the
respondents'
evidence
"does
not
establish
that
the
parties
intended
to
preclude
class
arbitration.
"
you
might
read
that
as
supporting
the
argument
that
you
are
proffering.
however,
i
believe
that
the
arbitrators
meant
that,
that
once
they
had
established
under
the
"any
disputes"
language
that
there
was
affirmative
general
authorization
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrators
to
choose
any
procedures,
to
have
this
in
their
toolbox,
then
in
order
to
overcome
that,
you
would
need
to
--
and
the
petitioners
were
trying
with
their
maritime
experts
--
to
show
an
intent
to
preclude.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
that's
right,
and
i
think
that's
very
important.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
together
with
the
language
on
49a
where
the
panel
expressly
rejects
the
idea
that
all
you
need
is
the
absence
of
language
forbidding
it.
right?
so
they've
already
--
they've
set
the
issue
up
exactly
as
you
--
your
hypothetical
would
require
them
to.
they've
said:
it's
not
enough
to
find--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--it's
on
49a,
the
second
sentence
under
the
heading
of
"discussion
of
parties'
contentions".
they
say,
"claimants
argue
that
bazzle
requires
clear
language
that
forbids
class
arbitration.
"
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
would--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--i
--
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
scalia--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--but
i
think
that
what's
very
important
here
is
that
judicial
review
is
under
a
very
deferential
standard,
which
is
confined
to
correcting--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--no,
but
this
charter
party
is
the
same
agreement
that
the
petitioners
have
with
every
absent
class
member.
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
every--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--but
they've--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
they've
already
entered
into
agreement.
they've
already
said
they
are
going
to
arbitrate
with
the
absent
class
members,
so
everybody
has
the
same
contract
that
says
"any
disputes",
and
the
question
is:
do
the
arbitrators,
under
that
broad
language,
have
the
authority?
and
i
would
point
this
court
to
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
mastrobuono,
which
read
a
clause
requiring
arbitration
of
any
controversy
to
empower
arbitrators
to
award
punitive
damages,
and
that
was
despite
established
new
york
state
law
to
the
contrary.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
think
that's
pretty
good
contract
law.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
and
that's
the
way
i
understand
it.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
think
that
if
they
wanted
to
write
around
it,
they
could
do
that,
as
this
court--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--could
it
be
interpreted
to
say--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--this
is
a
question
for
the
court?
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
think
--
i
don't
see
the
language
here
in
this
contract,
but
they
could
try
to
do
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
faa
that
bars
it.
and,
you
know,
as
we've
emphasized,
the
contract
interpretation,
under
ordinary
contract
rules
that
the
faa
has
consistently
applied
in
--
and
this
court
has
consistently
applied
to
the
faa
in
--
in
many,
many
cases
--
it's
ordinary
contract
law
we're
talking
about
here.
now,
i
just
think
one
thing
--
when
we
are
thinking
about
contract
law,
which
is
ordinarily
in
the
province
of
the
states,
i
think
it's
important
that
the
new
york
appellate
division,
in
cheng
v.
oxford
health
plans,
has
since
approved
just
such
an
arbitrator's
contract
interpretation
under
new
york
law,
allowing
class
arbitration
under
a
1998
pre-bazzle
clause--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--like
this
one.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
goes
back
to
whether
any
disputes
can
plausibly
be
read
to
encompass
the
class
mechanism,
because
if
it
can,
well,
then,
by
agreeing
to
that
contract,
you
have,
in
effect,
agreed
to
something
that
delegates
to
the
arbitrator
the
ability
to
use
that.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
so
when
you
picked--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--your
arbitrator
you
picked
your
arbitrator
knowing
that.
and
here,
they
had
extra
notice,
right,
because
this
case
had
been
filed
in
court
as
a
class
action?
they
knew
when
they
picked
these
arbitrators
--
and
you
can
tell
by
the
caliber
of
arbitrators
they
picked
--
that
they
knew
this
could
be
a
class
arbitration,
and
so
they
are
picking
people
who
are
up
to
that
task.
now,
they
also
know
that
they
are
going
to
dispute
that,
but
if
we're
right
that
the
arbitrators,
plausibly
and
under
the
--
the
marrs
standard
of
judicial
review,
have
--
have
sustainably
interpreted
this
contract
to
give
the
arbitrators
the
authority
to
proceed
on
a
class
basis,
well,
then,
i
think
your
objection--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--mr.
chief
justice,
disappears.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
right.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
think
that's
a
question
of
state
law.
for
example,
under
the
state
law
at
the
time
in
south
carolina,
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
found
in
bazzle
was
that
the
contract
was
silent,
but
the
--
applying
two
rules
of
contract
construction,
contra
proferentem
--
well,
one
rule
of
contract
construction
and
one
faa
rule,
which
is
the
moses
h.
cone
rule,
the
court
said:
we
find
this
contract
authorizes
it.
right?
so
there
was
contra
proferentem.
there
was
also,
which
i
haven't
mentioned
and
i
should,
the
moses
h.
cone
rule,
which
says
when
there's
any
ambiguity
about
the
scope
of
issues
that
have
been
given
to
the
arbitrator,
we
put
a
finger
on
the
scale
in
favor
of
giving
the
issue
to
the
arbitrator.
so
if
it's
unclear,
any
disputes,
well,
maybe
that
only
is
about
contract
issues,
where
the
court
in
jlm
said,
no,
it's
antitrust,
too--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--and
the
arbitrators
say
procedure,
too.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
understand
that
to
be
something
that's
answered
by
state
contract
law--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--and
it
might
differ
from
state
to
state.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
right.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
right.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
we,
the
arbitrators,
decide
that--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--not
we,
the
united
states
supreme
court.
it's
a
question
of
state
contract
law.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
yes.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
they
--
in
my
view,
haven't
answered
that
--
well,
maybe
they
answered
that
question
under
new
york
law.
they
have
answered
the
new
york
contract
law
question
that
was
put
to
them.
i
think
they
tee
it
up
in
a
way
that
mr.
waxman
and
i
agree
is
a
valid
statement
of
new
york
contract
law,
which
is
on
page
49.
we
look
to
the
parties'
intent
and
the
language
to
ascertain
whether
they
would
permit
or
preclude--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
and
if
they
have
applied
that
and
they
have
found
yes,
i
think
we
have
to
--
under
the
deferential
standard
of
review
that
applies
under
faa
section
10,
which
looks
only
at
gross
defects
in
the
process,
we
have
to
say
they
have
done
their
job,
they
have
found
this
contract
authorizes
the
arbitrators,
if
they
find
that
it's
necessary,
and
--
you
know,
we
do
have
a
right
--
this
argument
here,
which
is
that
they
haven't
done
anything.
they
haven't
decided
whether--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--well,
that's
a
good
question.
in
the
arbitrators'
own
opinion?
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
the
--
what
i'm
looking
to,
and
i'm
not
sure
this
is
going
to
be
the
best
cite
for
you,
but
in
the
petitioners'
reply
brief,
they
say,
the
--
on
page
6,
"the
parties
certainly
authorized
the
arbitrators
to
determine
whether
the
parties
intended
to
permit
or
prohibit
class
arbitration.
"
and
i
do
think
that's
an
accurate
statement
of
what
the
arbitrators--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--got
it.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--right.
well,
the
supplemental
agreement
does--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--now,
"permitted"
i
think
they
take
to
understand
as
"authorize",
and
the
reason
--
and
this
is
something
that
the
court,
in
the
context
of
sixth
circuit
dub
herring
case,
says
--
they
explain
why
do
we
use
the
language
"permit"?
we
use
it
because
they
are
not
saying
whether
we
are
actually
going
to
use
this
power;
we
are
just
saying
this
power
is
available
to
you.
but
i
think,
for
purposes
of
whether
the
contract
is
giving
the
authority
to
the
arbitrators,
that
"permitted"
means
"authorized".
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
yes.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
yes.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
yes.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
yes.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
thank
you.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
thank
you.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
think
that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
yes,
that's
right
--
56a
of
the--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--are
you
at
--
on
the
buff
--
in
the
buff
joint
appendix?
56a?
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
56a.
exactly.
it's
--
i've
bracketed
it
here.
it's
under
heading
3,
construction
of
the
arbitration
clause.
"upon
appointment,
the
arbitrator
shall
determine,
as
a
threshold
matter,
in
a
reasoned,
partial,
final
award,
on
the
construction
of
the
arbitration
clause,
whether
the
applicable
arbitration
clause
permits
the
arbitration
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
or
against
a
class.
"
so
the
question
put
to
them
is:
is
it
permissible
in
that
phase?
and
the
question
put
to
them
in
the
next
phase
is:
do
you
actually
want
to
use
it
in
the
context
of
this
case?
i
did
want
to
address
the
language
that
--
that
justice--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--in
my
view,
it
means
it
authorizes
the
arbitrators
to
choose.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
question
of
arbitration
procedure,
as
this
court
correctly
characterized
it
in
bazzle.
and,
typically,
what
you
have
is
an
arbitration
clause
that
says
you
arbitrate
any
disputes
and,
as
this
one
does,
it
doesn't
incorporate
any
arbitration
provider's
rules;
and,
therefore,
what
you
have
is
the
arbitrators
have
to
select
the
procedures.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
so
they're
not--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--i
would
say
that
if
you
have
--
well,
if
they've
chosen
the
arbitrator
and
we
have
chosen
the
arbitrator,
and
it's
the
same
arbitrator
and
the
arbitrator
wants
to
put
them
together,
under
this
language,
i
would
say
the
arbitrator
does
have
the
authority
to
do
that,
yes.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
would
say
no.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
he
doesn't
have
an
arbitration
agreement
with
you.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
he
doesn't
have
an
arbitration
agreement
that
has
the
same
language,
that
has
--
the
same
or
substantially
similar
language
giving
the
arbitrator
the
authority
to
use
class
procedures.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
i
think
your
question
is
getting
to
we
have
evidence
of
subjective
intent
here
and
none
there,
but
the
new
york
law,
as
is
the
law
in
many
jurisdictions,
is
an
objective
intent
standard,
so
you
look
to
the
language
as
evidence
of
intent.
and
on
this
intent
question,
i
did
just
want
to
respond
to
a
question
that
justice
alito
had
asked
mr.
waxman
about
mr.
persky
saying
there
has
been
no
agreement
that
has
been
reached
on
this
issue,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
buff-colored
appendix,
on
page
77a.
now,
he
clarifies
in
the
next
sentence
that
what
he
--
what
he
is
speaking
to
there
is
there
has
been
no
agreement
to
bar
class
arbitrations,
right?
but
this
is
in
the
context
of
disputes
over
whether
this
maritime
expert
witness
testimony
is
going
to
be
admitted.
and
i
think
it's
very
clarifying
that
two
pages
later,
at
page
79a
of
the
joint
appendix,
mr.
persky
expressly
makes
the
argument
that
we
believe
the
arbitrators
adopted,
which
is
that
the
arbitration
clause
here
contains
broad
language,
and
this
language
should
be
interpreted
to
permit
class
arbitrations.
and
at
the
end
of
the
following
paragraph
he
continues:
"use
of
"any"
normally
means
all
and
includes
class
arbitration.
"
except
--
"unless
expressly
excluded".
so
he
is
two
pages
later
making--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i'm
quoting
from
the
buff-colored
joint
appendix
at
page
79a
around
the
middle
of
the
page
and
then
in
the
following
paragraph.
so
he's
clearly
making
the
argument
here,
and
he
doesn't
make
it
in
the
brief
that
mr.
waxman
cited.
and
i
think
the
arbitrators
correctly
rejected
the
--
the
respondents'
framing
of
that
issue
and
actually
went
further,
as
they
say
in
their
opinion.
they
didn't
think
that
those
were
adequate
grounds
to
rule
for
the
respondents,
for
us.
they
thought
they
had
to
find
an
intent
in
the
contract.
and
then
mr.
persky
does
make
that
argument,
which
i
think
is
the
winning
argument,
here
on
page
79a.
now--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--i
think
it
would
if
--
and
if
the
--
that
might
be
the
exact
kind
of
fact
situation
that
if
the
arbitrators
somehow
ignored
that
in
reading
the
contract
and
said,
oh,
you
--
we
still
have
the
authority
to
authorize
a
class,
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
under
this
very
deferential
standard
of
review
might
be
exceeding
their
powers--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--many
such
contracts,
and
indeed
there
are
contracts
that
started
doing
that
back
in
the
'90s.
i
think
the
case
before
--
discover
bank
is
a
party
that
started
to
put
express
no-class-action
terms.
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
that's
right.
but
at
least
it
was
incumbent
on
them
to
do
that
here
if
this
was
something
that
they
were
so
concerned
about
would
be
such
a
burden
on
them.
and
the
fact
that
they
did
not
do
that,
even
though
class
arbitration
has
been
something
that
has
been
happening
actively
in
california
for
at
least
a
quarter
century
--
this
is
one
of
the
largest,
you
know
--
with
an
economy--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--i'm
not
so
sure.
i
mean,
we
don't
have
evidence
that
--
that
it
has
been
going
on,
no,
because
this
is
a--
ms.
cornelia
tl
pillard
--thank
you.
