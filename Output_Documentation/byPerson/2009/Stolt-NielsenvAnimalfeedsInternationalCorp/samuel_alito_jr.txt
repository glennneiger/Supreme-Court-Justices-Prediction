justice
samuel
a.
alito,

didn't
you
just--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--didn't
you
just
say
that
the
parties
agreed
that
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
minds
on
this
issue?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
your
understanding
of
what
mr.
persky
says
at
77a
of
the
joint
appendix?
he
was
--
i
take
it
he
was
counsel
for
animalfeeds?
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
he
says
all
the
parties
agree
that
when
a
contract
is
silent
on
an
issue,
there
has
been
no
agreement
that
has
been
reached
on
that
issue;
therefore,
there
has
been
no
agreement
to
bar
class
arbitrations.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
then
i
don't
understand
what
issue
there
was
for
the
arbitrator
to
--
arbitrators
to
decide--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--other
than
to
impose
a
rule
like
the
rule
that
had
been
adopted
by
south
carolina.
but
that
would
not
be
within
their
power,
unless
they
could
presumably
find
that
rule
in
federal
maritime
law
or
new
york
law.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
was
the
issue
for
them
to
decide?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
complicated
arbitration
issues,
and
so
for
present
purposes,
it
suffices
to
say
that
we
hold
that
imposing
class
arbitration
on
parties
who
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
their
disputes
but
have
not
agreed
to
authorize
class
arbitration
is
not
consistent
with
the
federal
arbitration
act.
we
therefore
reverse
and
remand.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
breyer
have
joined.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
