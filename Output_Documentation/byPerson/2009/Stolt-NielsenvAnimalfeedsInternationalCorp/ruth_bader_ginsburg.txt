mr.
waxman,
there's
a
preliminary
question
in
this
case,
and
that
is:
there
was
one
agreement,
undoubtedly
signed
by
both
sides,
and
that
was
the
one
to
submit
to
the
arbitrator
the
question
whether
the
arbitration
clause
permitted
class
treatment.
the
arbitrators
answered
that
question,
which
they
were
given
authority
to
do
so
by
both
sides,
and
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
arbitrators
answered
within
the
ballpark.
if
we
agree
with
that,
then
there's
nothing
else
to
consider
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
the
arbitrators
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
may
i
ask
you
--
because
your
time
is
running
and
we
are
spending
all
of
your
time
on
this
preliminary
question.
there
is
one
fundamental
flaw,
it
seems
to
me,
in
your
argument,
and
i'd
like
you
to
answer
it.
and
you
can
call
it
"the
vanishing
class
action".
animalfeeds
wanted
to
be
in
court,
not
in
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
--
and
they
wanted
to
bring
a
class
action.
you
persuaded
the
second
circuit
they
belong
in
arbitration.
so
now
they
are
in
arbitration.
you
say:
the
only
thing
we
consented
to
is
a
one-on-one
claim.
fine.
animalfeeds
can
then
say:
fine,
well,
we
didn't
consent
to
anything
more
than
the
one-on-one.
we
had
a
class
action.
we
had
--
we
were
in
court.
we
could
have
proceeded
in
an
individual
action
or
a
class
action.
now
we
are
in
arbitration,
and
under
the
agreement,
as
you
read
it,
we
can't
have
the
class
action
in
arbitration.
that
doesn't
mean
it
vanishes,
because
if
it
does,
then
the
arbitration
clause
is
not
merely
saying
what
the
arbitrator
can
decide,
but
it
is
shrinking
drastically
the
dimensions
of
animalfeeds'
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
what
it
was
doing
in
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
--
and
the
court
said
this
goes
to
arbitration.
what
is
the
"this"?
if
it's
only
a
one-on-one
claim,
how
do
they
lose
the
larger
claim
that
they
had
in
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
never
--
they
never
gave
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
--
if
the
--
if
you
would
regard
arbitration
as
a
change
in
forum,
like
a
forum
selection
clause,
it
says
where
you
go,
but
it
doesn't
change,
if
you
have
to
go
to
another
forum,
what
your
claim
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
that
what's
on
56a
of
the
joint
appendix,
construction
of
the
arbitration
clause?
that's
what
mr.
waxman
referred
us
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"upon
appointment,
the
arbitrator
shall
determine,
as
a
threshold
matter.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
56a.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
let's
assume
that
you
prevail
in
this
case.
i
--
i
would
assume
that
the
tankers
are
now
going
to
add
to
their
contract,
as
many
contracts
do,
a
provision
saying
no
class
action
--
you
cannot
proceed
in
a
class
action.
if
the
arbitration
agreement
says
agreed
to
arbitrate
any
and
all
disputes,
but
you
may
not
proceed
on
behalf
of
a
class,
would
that
preclude
you
from
bringing
a
class
action
any
place?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
many,
many
contracts
--
and
pick
up
your
average
credit
card
agreement
--
that
will
say
you
may
not
bring
this
as
a
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you
won't
get
--
you
win
this
case,
but
then
all
the
future
animalfeeds
lose
because
they'll
just
put
in
the
arbitration
agreement
you
can't
proceed
on
class.
