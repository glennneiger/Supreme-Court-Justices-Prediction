justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
no
such
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought,
in
contracts,
there
is
no
such
answer.
when
you
interpret
a
contract
and
it
doesn't
say,
you
try
to
figure
out
--
i
used
to
be
taught
that;
probably
i
am
way
out-of-date
--
you
try
to
figure
out
what
a
reasonable
party
would
have
intended.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
thought
that's
what
bazzle
said,
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
as
out-of-date.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that
now,
but
then
--
but
there
are
two
separate
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
was,
first,
the
same
as
justice
ginsburg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
have
a
question
for
you
on
that,
because
in
reading
these
briefs,
i
thought
your
description
of
who
is
to
decide
this
matter
of
whether
there
is
to
be
a
class
action
was
just
what
you
said:
the
question
of
who
should
decide
it
is
a
matter
for
the
parties.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
when
i
looked
at
--
i
just
have
been
reading
bazzle
three,
five
times,
and
there
seemed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
but
what
it
seems
to
say
is
that
that's
a
matter
to
figure
out
from
a
contract
and
background
circumstances.
in
bazzle,
the
contract
was:
any
--
all
disputes
relating
to
this
contract.
here,
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says:
"any
dispute
arising
from
the
performance,
termination,
or
making
of
the
contract.
"
now,
a
class-action
determination
does
relate
to.
maybe
it
doesn't
arise
out
of,
okay?
that's
an
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
are
all
these
briefs
saying
that
what
bazzle
said
was:
whenever
this
is
silent,
it
goes
to
the
arbitrator;
the
who
question
is
answered
at
arbitration.
i
can't
find
it
saying
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
know.
i
know.
but
what
i
actually
thought
doesn't
matter.
what
matters
is
what
is
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you're
--
so
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
is,
as
to
the
who
question,
who
shall
decide
whether
or
not
in
your
case
class
actions
are
permissible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
who
question
in
bazzle,
because
of
the
contract
and
background,
was
the
arbitrator.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
who
question
here,
irrespective
of
the
contract
is
the
arbitrator
for
the
reason
that
justice
ginsburg
said.
there's
a
separate
saying:
you
are
the
who;
you,
arbitrators,
are
the
who.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
we
look
to
the
what.
they
then
decided
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
--
what
did
they
decide?
and
you
are
saying
that's
wrong.
and
there
you
run
into
all
the
authority,
misco,
who
used
to
be
in
other
places,
saying
when
the
arbitrator
says
something,
unless
it's
in
marrs,
follow
it.
that's
what
you
are
addressing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
--
isn't
that
--
you
and
i
have
a
contract.
i'll
ship
you
17
pounds
of
durum
wheat,
and
you
will
pay
me
$43.
in
the
meantime,
a
green
worm
eats
up
all
the
durum
wheat,
and
therefore
they
can't
send
durum
wheat;
they
send
some
duhu
wheat.
all
right?
question:
is
the
contract
valid
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
answer:
we
have
courts
for
that
purpose.
we
have
arbitrators
for
that
purpose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
arbitrators
will
look
to
see
what
it
says.
if
it
says
nothing,
they
will
try
to
determine
what
the
parties
thought.
if
they
can't
determine
what
they
thought,
they
will
look
to
custom,
analogy,
et
cetera.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
won't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where
i
started
this.
we
don't
get
many
contract
interpretation
cases,
and
that's
why
i
--
i
needed
to
go
back
to
jack
dawson,
who
is
a
great
contracts
professor.
and
i
am--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
have
that
pleasure,
but
the--
[laughter]
the
--
but
the
--
as
i
recall,
the
way
i
would
have
interpreted
--
imagine
a
worker
who
says:
i
have
a
right,
permission
--
it's
permissible
for
me
to
eat
lunch
next
to
the
machine.
the
employer
says
no.
the
question
was
what
is
--
does
the
contract
permit
this
or
not?
so
the
arbitrator
or
the
judge
reads
the
words.
nothing.
they
have
no
idea.
then
the
judge
or
the
arbitrator
reads
the
rest
of
the
contract.
hasn't
a
clue.
then
the
arbitrator
or
the
judge
goes
and
looks
and
sees
what's
practice
around
here?
"i
don't
know".
then
they
might
look
to
what
happens
in
the
rest
of
the
industry.
then
they
might
look
to
what
happens
in
foreign
countries
with
comparable
industries.
then
they
might
look
to
public
policy.
they
might
look
almost
to
anything
under
the
sun
they
think
is
relevant,
and
the
way,
in
jargon,
you
describe
the
bottom
line
is:
they
have
found
a
meeting
of
the
minds
as
to
what
this
means.
now,
of
course,
it
isn't
really
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
but
that's
just
the
summary
of
the
conclusion
as
to
what,
objectively
read,
those
words
in
the
contract
mean.
now,
that's
how
i
think
i
would
have
learned
it.
is
that
still
done,
or
is
there
some
other
way
of
describing
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
contract
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
i
take
it
what
they're
saying
is:
it
may
be
true
that
the
arbitrators,
when
they
looked
at
some
of
those
elements,
really
got
it
wrong.
now,
if
they
are
correct
on
that
--
this
is
the
other
question
i
have.
you
are
going
to
say:
no,
they're
not
--
they
didn't
get
it
that
wrong;
wrong,
maybe,
but
not
that
wrong.
all
right.
now,
can
they
not
do
this?
the
next
person
who
has
this
form
contract
does
not
so
readily
agree
it's
up
to
the
arbitrator
to
say
whether
that
contains
a
class
action
or
not.
rather,
they
say:
i
read
this
contract
as
reserving
that
question
to
the
court.
it's
not
the
same
language
as
was
there
in
bazzle;
it's
not
the
same
industry
of
the
kind
you
had
in
bazzle;
and,
therefore,
a
judge
should
decide
that.
that's
the
meeting
of
the
minds
on
the
who
question.
and
then
we'll
get
it
all
resolved,
because
the
judge
might
come
out
differently
if
they're
right,
and
maybe
arbitrators
will
follow
the
judge.
i'm
interested,
because
we
might
have
to
write
something,
in
your
answer
to
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
--
we
know
they're
going
to
--
they
have
something
already
in
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
supplemental
agreement
here
because
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
reading
this,
the
supplemental
agreement
submitted
the
case
under
rule
3--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
aaa,
and
it's
supplement--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--rule
3
of
the
aaa
supplementary
rules
says,
an
arbitrator
shall,
quote,
"determine,
as
a
threshold
matter,
in
a
reasoned,
partial,
final
award,
on
the
construction
of
the
arbitration
clause,
whether
the
applicable
arbitration
clause
permits
the
arbitration
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
or
against
a
class.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
thought
the
supplemental
agreement
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--apply
rule
3,
and
therefore,
it
was
asking
the
arbitrators
to
decide
the
question
put
in
rule
3.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
we
could
get
the
question
by
reading
page
7
of
the
blue
brief.
