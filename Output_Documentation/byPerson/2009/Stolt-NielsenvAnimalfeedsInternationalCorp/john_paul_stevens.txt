mr.
waxman,
can
i
ask
this
preliminary
question?
assume
the
contract
expressly
authorized
class
arbitration.
would
you
agree
that
was
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
would
you
agree
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
law,
to
enforce
such
a
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is,
does
the
federal
statute
prohibit
that
kind
of
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
agree
that
if
they
phrased
their
order
a
little
differently
and
said
we
think
that
the
best
reading
of
this
agreement
is
that
the
parties
intended
to
authorize
class
arbitration,
then
you
would
have
no
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
there
was
manifest
disregard--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
you
would
not
contend
--
you
are
not
arguing
that
that
would
be
manifest--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what,
in
your
view
--
what,
in
your
view,
were
the
arbitrators
asked
to
decide
by
the
submission
by
the
parties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
bit
puzzled.
i
don't
understand
how
something
--
if
you
ask
whether
something
permits
it,
and
if
it
doesn't
prohibit
it,
doesn't
it
a
fortiori
permit
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
just,
right
there,
interrupt
with
one
question.
the
alternatives
before
the
arbitrator
were
whether
it
is
permitted
or
precluded?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
not
what
they
said
there,
is
it?
that
--
that
the
parties
agree
they're
silent
--
that
whether
they
--
if
they
are
silent,
whether
they
permit
or
preclude
class
action.
those
are
the
two
alternatives
that
they
were
confronted
with.
they
decided
that
it
did
not
preclude;
ergo,
it
permitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
the
answer
to
that
on
page
49a
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
question
you
were
asked
was
whether
that
silence
should
be
interpreted
as
a
preclusion
or
a
permission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
there
was
a
permission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
agree
with
that,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
help
me
with
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
question,
a
very
basic,
elementary
questions?
where
in
the
record
is
the
specific
question
to
the
arbitrators
found
--
that
they
were
asked
to
respond
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
what
the
arbitrators
said,
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
says
we
want
you
to
answer
this
narrow
question,
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
record
does
not
contain--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
specific
question
that
arbitrators
were
asked
to
answer.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
i
understand
what
they
say
they
were
asked
to
answer,
but
i
thought
there
would
be
some
document
saying
we've
agreed
to
this
supplemental
arbitration
agreement,
which
is
going
to
define
what
the
answer
--
what
is
the
question
you
have
to
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
don't
think,
that
--
from
what
i've
been
able
to
read,
i
don't
think
they
were
ever
asked
the
question
whether
the
agreement
authorizes
class
action
or
class
procedures.
they
were
only
asked
to
decide
whether
it
either
permitted
it
or
precluded
it,
but
is
that
what
the
question
really
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
supplemental
agreement,
they
were
asked
a
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
underlying
arbitration
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
can't
find
what
that
specific
question
was,
which
seems,
to
me,
answers
the
whole
case,
if
we
could
find
out
what
it
is.
