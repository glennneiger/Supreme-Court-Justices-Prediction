mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
courts,
arbitrators
derive
their
authority
solely
from
the
consent
of
the
parties
to
a
particular
agreement.
that
agreement
determines
not
only
what
the
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitrate,
but
just
as
fundamentally,
with
whom
they
have
agreed
to
do
so.
and
when
the
agreement
reveals
no
intent,
no
meeting
of
the
minds
to
add
participants,
but
the
arbitrators
nonetheless
extend
their
reach
to
hundreds
of
parties
of
other
contracts,
they
violate
the
basic
principle
reflected
in
the
faa
that
their
authority
is
created
and
circumscribed
by
an
agreement.
the
decision
to
impose
class
proceedings
is
not
the
kind
of
incidental
procedural
matter
that
arbitrators
have
to
resolve
in
order
to
discharge
their
responsibilities
under
the
foundational
agreement.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
ginsburg.
the
arbitrators
--
the
agreement
reflected
in
paragraph
7
of
the
supplemental
agreement
--
that
is,
to
proceed
to
arbitration
under
the
auspices
of
rules
3
through
7
of
the
aaa
rules,
and
rule
3
itself
contemplated
precisely
submitting
precisely
the
contract
issue
that
the
bazzle
plurality
said
should
go
to
the
arbitrators.
that
is,
looking
at
the
arbitration
clause
itself,
does
it
objectively
reveal
an
agreement
among
the
two
parties
to
permit
or
prohibit
class
or
consolidated
treatment,
or
is
it
truly
silent?
that
is
a
question
of
contract
interpretation.
that
is
the
question
that
was
submitted
to
the
arbitrators.
there
is
a
separate
statutory
question
that
arises
if
the
answer
to
the
contract
question
is
number
3.
there
is
no
meeting
of
the
minds.
it
is
truly
silent--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--excuse
me.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
breyer--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
very
--
i
very
much
doubt
that
you
are
way
out-of-date.
if
you
are,
i
shudder
to
think
where
i
am.
but
let
me
be
clear--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
hope
i
am
as
up-to-date
as
i
need
to
be
to
provide
a
coherent,
correct
answer.
my
proposition
is
twofold,
and
only
the
second
part
gets
to
your
question.
the
first
is
that
the
arbitrators
in
this
case
decided
the
contractual
question,
the
--
did
the
parties
have
a
meeting
of
the
minds,
yes
or
no?
and
if
so,
was
it?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
the
arbitrators
then
went
on
to
say:
even
though
there
is
no
meeting
of
the
minds
objectively
revealed,
nonetheless
we
are
going
to
apply
a
background
rule
that
puts
the
burden
on
the
party
opposing
arbitration
to
prove
that
there
is
an
intent
to
preclude.
so,
we're
establishing
that
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--exactly.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
i
have
an
answer--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
question--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
you
are
nowhere
near
up
to
me,
then.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
no,
no,
no--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
what
--
and
i
--
i'm
interpreting
the
plurality
opinion
that
you
wrote
--
or
you
and
three
of
your
colleagues--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
well,
our
understanding
--
what
bazzle
said
is,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
opinion
--
look,
here's
the
case:
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
found
that
the
arbitration
clause
is
truly
silent,
and
it
then
applied
a
rule
of
state
law
that
says,
if
it's
silent,
class
treatment
will
be
permitted.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
decide
whether
that
rule
of
south
carolina
law
applied
to
this
case
is
precluded
by
the
faa,
which
requires
actual
consent,
not
coercion.
now,
what
the
plurality
in
bazzle,
with
respect,
said
is:
we
can't
reach
the
legal
question,
the
statutory
faa
question
on
which
we
granted
review,
because
we
can't
be
certain
that
the
contract
really
is
silent.
to
be
sure,
there's
no
express
provision,
but
bazzle
--
the
bazzle
plaintiffs
say
that
it
is
silent,
and
green
tree
says,
no,
if
you
look
at
other
words
in
it,
including
the
right
to
choose
each
arbitrator
for
each
arbitration,
it's
not
--
the
south
carolina
courts
answered
the
question,
but
they
are
not
the
ones,
because
when
you
are
talking
about
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
a
contract
that
has
committed
to
arbitration,
that
is
for
the
arbitrators
to
decide.
the
arbitrators
have
to
decide
whether
there
was
actually
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
--
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
exactly.
so
in
bazzle--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
exactly.
and
--
and
this
case
presents
exactly
the
same
answer
to
that
question
that
bazzle
presented
when
it
was
granted
review;
that
is,
there
is
--
there
was
an
interpretation
of
the
contract
in
bazzle,
and
an
application
of
a
legal
principle
to
that
interpretation.
the
who
for
what
--
what
the
parties
actually
intended
is
the
arbitrator.
that's
what
the
bazzle
plurality,
together
with
justice
stevens,
both
decided.
the
question
that
arises,
the
legal
question
that
arises,
only
if
the
arbitrators
say
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
minds:
so
what
rule
does
the
faa
allow
us
to
apply
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
that
is
for
courts,
and
you
didn't
reach
it
because
the
preliminary
question
of
whether
the
contract
was
really
silent,
the
predicate
question,
wasn't
answered.
and
you
remanded
for
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
it
expressly
authorized
it?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
it
expressly
authorized
class
participation,
obviously,
we
would
have
no
argument
that
the
parties
had
not
agreed
to
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my
--
i
have
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
certainly
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
mean,
the
only
reason
--
the
only
reason
i'm
hedging
--
and
i
don't
mean
to
hedge,
but
trying
to
be
thoughtful
--
is
that
this
court
explained
in
mitsubishi,
in
the
context
of
the
arbitration
of
a
sherman
act
agreement,
and
subsequently
in
gilmer
and
other
statutory
cases,
that
in
determining
whether
class
participation
or
some
other
form
of
remedy
is
or
isn't
available,
there
is
a
two-part
inquiry.
the
first
part
is:
what
was
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement?
what
is
it
that
the
parties
have
agreed--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--then
we
would
have
review
only
under
the
--
i
don't
know
that
i
would
characterize
it
this
way,
but
what
justice
breyer
characterized,
the
marrs
standard
of
review;
that
is,
you
would
have
to
show--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--manifest
disregard,
and
a
manifest--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
our
--
and
the
petition
in
this
case
presented
the
question
as
given,
presented
the
issue
of
contract
construction
as
given,
that
the
contract
itself
was
silent,
not
only
in
the
sense
that
it
didn't
include
an
express
provision
or
prohibition,
but
also
that
it
reflected
no
meeting
of
the
minds.
it
objectively
revealed
no
meeting
of
the
minds,
looking
not
only
at
the
actual
text
of
the
contract,
but
also
looking
at
the
other
indicia
--
objective
indicia
of
intent
that
courts
use
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
arbitrators
were
asked
to
decide
whether
the
arbitration
agreement
objectively
reveals
consent
to
prohibit,
permit
--
whether
it
reveals
a
meeting
of
the
minds
to
prohibit
class
treatment,
permit
class
treatment,
or
whether
it
was
truly
silent.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
if
you
look
at--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
no,
no,
no.
the
parties
that
--
i
mean
--
we
actually
--
let
me
step
back
and
give
--
and
give
the
history
of
it.
this
case
arose
immediately
in
the
wake
of
bazzle.
okay?
they
sued
in
court;
we
obtained
an
order
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
sending
them
to
arbitration.
bazzle
is
decided,
and
we're
all
looking
at
bazzle,
and
we
decide
--
like
the
aaa,
which
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
and
said
it
drafted
these
rules
in
order
to
provide
a
procedure
to
answer
the
bazzle
contract
interpretation
question;
the
aaa
says,
we
don't
have
any
view
about
the
statutory
question
that
arises
from
silence
--
so
we
drafted
a
supplemental
agreement
that,
in
paragraph
7,
incorporates
the
aaa
rules
3
through
7.
and
the
aaa
rule
3,
which
is
included
on
page
56
of
the
joint
appendix,
is
headed
"construction
of
the
arbitration
clause".
and
it
requires
the
arbitrators
in
this
arbitration
to
determine,
quote,
"on
construction
of
the
arbitration
clause,
whether
the
applicable
arbitration
clause
permits
the
arbitration
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
or
against
a
class.
"
the,
quote,
"clause
construction
award".
now,
the
legal
--
the
arbitrators
in
this
case
concluded
that
it
neither
permitted
nor
prohibited,
either
by
its
express
terms
or
by
reference
to
other
objective
indicia
of
intent--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
--
in
the
context
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
this
court
has
made
clear
more
times
than
i
can
remember
that
the
central
purpose
is
to
ensure
that
private
agreements
to
arbitrate
are
enforced
according
to
their
terms,
the
question
is:
have
the
parties
agreed
to
it
if
there
is
a
meeting
of
the
minds?
if
no
meeting
of
the
minds
is
objectively
revealed,
under
the
faa,
the
arbitrator
exceeds
his
authority
in
requiring
class
arbitration.
it's
--
there
is
no
consent.
and
if
there
is
no
consent,
the
legal
rule
under
--
the
hallmark
principle
of
the
faa
is
this
is
a
private
consensual
matter.
this
is
not
a
court
exercising
public
coercive
authority.
i
mean,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--correct.
he--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--correct.
i
mean--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--so
here's
was
--
here's
what
the
issue
was.
they
said
the
contract
is
completely
silent
and,
as
you
quoted
on
page
77,
the
part
--
there's
no
meeting
of
the
minds
on
this
issue
at
all.
that
was
their
position
about
the
construction
of
the
contract.
our
position
about
the
construction
of
the
contract
was
that,
in
fact,
although
there
is
no
express
provision
one
way
or
the
other,
this
is
a
maritime
contract,
and
the
--
and
maritime
law
is
ascertained
by
custom
and
practice.
and
we
introduced
evidence
in
the
form
of
affidavits
that
were
unrefuted
that
since
the
days
of
marco
polo,
these
types
of
spot
voyages
have
been--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
owe
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
exactly.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
--
in
the
context
of
a
court
that
has
jurisdiction
over
a
dispute
and
exercises
coercive
power,
it
has
to
get
to
an
answer.
when
you
are
talking
about
private
arbitration,
where
the
model
is
a
private
agreement
to
resolve
things
between
two
parties,
this
--
under
the
faa,
the
arbitrators
get
their
authority
only
as
to
matters
as
to
which
there
is
consent.
and
there
is
--
going
to
justice
alito's
question,
there
was
consent.
it
was
submitted
for
purpose
of
determining
whether
--
if
you
look
at
the
contract
and
look
at
background
rules
and
look
at
parol
evidence
and
look
at
custom
and
practice,
can
you
discern
whether,
as
--
as
you
put
it
in
--
in
the
opinion
in
howsam,
justice
breyer,
whether
the
contract,
quote,
"objectively
reveals
an
agreement"
by
the
two
parties.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
exactly.
and
--
and
maybe
the
ambiguity
here
is
the
fluidity
of
the
term
"silence".
"silence"
can
mean
there's
no
express
provision.
"silence"
could
also
mean,
well,
if
you
look
at
other
words
in
the
text
of
the
contract,
you
can't
work
your
way
through
to
conclude
that
there
was
in
fact
an
intent.
it
also
may
mean
--
and
this
is
the
sense
that
i
am
using
it
in,
and
i
think
the
sense
that
the
arbitrators
have
authority
to
do,
is
to
say,
well,
let's
look
and
see,
for
example,
if
there
is
custom
and
practice
that
would
inform
the
backdrop
against
which
the
parties
negotiate--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no,
i
think
an
arbitrator
can.
the
arbitrator
has
plenary
authority,
subject
to
manifest
disregard
review,
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
minds
of
the
parties.
and
it
can
use
the
text
of
the
statute;
it
can
use
an
applicable
background
principle
of
governing
law;
it
can
use
principles
like
contra
proferentem,
as
this
court
did
in--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
have
plenary
authority
to
apply
rules
of
construction
that
go
to
the
parties'
intent,
that
go
to
whether
there
is
--
possible
to
discern
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
they
don't
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
that
courts
can
--
for
example,
a
court
can
say
--
and
the
other
side
relies
heavily
on
a
seventh
circuit
opinion
by
judge
posner,
where
he
basically
says:
there
is
no
intent
here,
but
courts
apply
contract
constructions
that
seem
most
sensible
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
and
that's
what
we
are
going
to
do.
that's
what
a
court
can
do
and
an
arbitrator
can't.
the
arbitrator
can
use
any
tools
possible,
including,
largely,
the
text
and
custom
and
practice,
in
order
to
define
whether
or
not
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
but
if
there
wasn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
it's
a
radical
proposition--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--as
a
matter
of
what
courts
can
do,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
express
what
an
arbitrator
can
do.
and
he
was
--
he
was
performing
the
kind
of
function,
ostensibly,
that
you
said
that
should
be
done
by
an
arbitrator
in
bazzle.
he
was
doing
it
as
a
court.
but
arbitrators
have
to
construe
the
agreement
itself
between
the
two
parties
to
see
if
there
is
a
meeting
of
the
minds.
and
there
are
lots
of
tools
they
can
use.
and
just
to
get
back
to
your
question,
justice
alito--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
sorry
--
in
this
case,
we
said
the
contract
was
not
truly
silent,
that
--
essentially,
we
argued
what
judge
rakoff
concluded.
they
said:
no,
no,
no;
it
is
truly
silent,
but
you
should
rule
for
us
on
other
grounds.
and
may
i
please
ask
the
court,
if
you
have
it,
to
turn
to
page
22
of
our
blue
brief,
because
on
page
22
of
our
blue
brief
we
have
reprinted
exactly
what
animalfeeds
told
the
arbitrators
were
the
reasons
why
they
should
win,
in
light
of
mr.
persky's
statement
that
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
minds.
and
it
is
the
indented
paragraph.
this
is
all
that
they
said:
"the
parties'
arbitration
clause
should
be
construed
to
allow
class
arbitration
because
(a)
the
clause
is
silent
on
the
issue
of
class
treatment,
and
without
express
prohibition,
class
arbitration
is
permitted
under
bazzle.
"
the
arbitrator
said:
no,
that's
not
what
bazzle
means.
bazzle
doesn't
mean
that
unless
there's
an
express
prohibition,
it's
--
it's
permitted.
so
that
was
their
reason
number
one.
let's
go
to
their
reason
number
3.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
said
it
in
--
pardon
me
while
i
get
the
page.
page
49a:
"claimants
argue
that
bazzle
requires
clear
language
that
forbids
class
arbitration
in
order
to
bar
a
class
action.
"
"the
panel,
however,
agrees
with
respondents
that
the
test
is
a
more
general
one.
"
"arbitrators
must
look
to
the
language
of
the
parties'
agreement
to
ascertain
the
parties'
intention,
whether
they
intended
to
permit
or
to
preclude
class
arbitration.
"
now,
let's
go
back
to
what
they
told
the
arbitrators,
and
it's
reprinted
on
page
22.
i
am
going
to
skip--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--or
was
silent.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
with
--
with
respect
--
and
i'll
--
let
me
answer
this
question--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--before
getting
back
to
the
--
what
that
--
what
--
look,
you
--
you
may
find,
contrary
to
the
cert
grant
in
this
case,
that
the
predicate
of
our
petition
is
wrong.
our
petition
is
predicated
on
the
understanding
that
the
arbitrators
found
that
the
contract
was
truly
silent;
that
is,
it
expressed
no
meeting
of
the
minds.
and,
therefore,
this
case
presents
the
question--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
we
know
from
the
arbitrators'
decision--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--as
--
as
a
background
rule,
that's
what
they
said.
what
they
said
was,
they
--
first
of
all
--
and
we
are
looking
at
page
52
--
they
acknowledge
the
force
of
the
argument,
quote,
"that
the
bulk
of
international
shippers
would
never
intend
to
have
their
disputes
decided
in
a
class
arbitration.
"
but
they
said,
well,
we
can
deal
with
that
later
in
deciding
whether
they
can
opt
in
or
out.
i
mean,
the
point
is
that
if
you
have
to
opt
in
because
it's
clear
that
you
never
agreed,
there
is
no
meeting
of
the
minds.
secondly--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
incorrect,
with
respect.
animalfeeds
doesn't
have
a
class
claim.
animalfeeds
has
a
claim.
its
claim
is
that
it
paid
too
much
for
the
contracts
that
it
entered
into
--
the
charter
parties
--
to
ship
some
sort
of
oil
from
panama
to
ports
around
the
world.
it
is
--
it
was
asking
a
court,
and
is
now
asking
an
arbitrator,
to
join
in
the
separate
claims
that
other
parties
to
other
contracts
with
other
terms--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--exactly.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
--
you
know,
that
argument
--
in
the
jlm
case,
which
is
the
case
in
which
the
second
circuit,
the
district
court
in
the
second
circuit
said,
no,
you
have
to
arbitrate
this
--
their
briefs
actually
made
this
point.
their
briefs
said
you
can't
send
us
to
arbitration,
because
we
won't
get
class
treatment
in
arbitration.
and
the
second
--
the
district
court
in
the
second
circuit
said
you
have
got
to
arbitrate
according
to
the
terms
of
your
agreement.
in
footnote
9
of
the
second
circuit's
opinion--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
never--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--their
claim
was
we
paid
too
much.
and
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
your
point
that
they
aren't
allowed
to
proceed
in
class
arbitration
is
no
different
than
the
fact
that
by
agreeing
to
arbitrate
this
bilateral
dispute,
the
parties
agreed
to
dispense
with
an
appeal
and
with
meaningful
judicial
review
of
the
things
the
arbitrators
decided.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
will.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
--
i
was
hoping
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
but
nothing
is
more
important
than--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--than
answering
the
court's
questions.
so
i
think
we
have
dealt
with
(a).
they
--
they
said
(a)
we
win
because
bazzle
requires
it.
the
arbitrators
correctly
said
no.
i
want
to
skip
(b),
because
my
submission
is
that
(b)
is
what
they
did.
(c)
says
the
clause
would
be
unconscionable
and
unenforceable
if
it
forbade
class
arbitration.
the
panel
said:
we
aren't
reaching
that;
we
are
not
deciding
that
question.
so
what's
left?
the
only
other
argument
that
animalfeeds
made
was
(b):
the
clause
should
be
construed
to
permit
class
arbitration
as
a
matter
of
public
policy.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
arbitrators
did.
what
they
said
was
--
and
this
is
on
page
51
of
the
petition
appendix
--
they
said
that
if
they
followed
a
strict
contractual
theory,
quote,
"there
would
appear
to
be
no
basis
for
a
class
action,
absent
express
agreement
among
all
parties
and
putative
class
members.
"
and
they
then,
lower
down
on
the
page,
then
said
that
we
were
required
to
prove
that
the
parties,
quote,
"intended
to
preclude
arbitration".
that
is,
they
applied
a
background
rule
that
they
thought
was
desirable
from
a
public
policy
sense.
and
our
sole
submission
here,
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case,
is
that
that
decision
is
not
--
is
precluded
by
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
requires
that
contracts
to
arbitrate
be
construed
only
in
accordance
with
their
terms
and
what
the
parties
agreed
with.
and
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act
couldn't
be
clearer
that
they
--
they
can
only
proceed,
quote,
"in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
their
agreement.
"
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
three
points,
so
i
will
take
25
seconds
for
each
point.
first
of
all,
these
contracts
in
the
class
are
not
all
the
same.
these
are
form
contracts
that
are
drafted
by
the
charterers
and
their
brokers,
and
they
involve
different
clauses,
including
different
arbitration
clauses.
the
second
point,
the
rule
3,
i
think,
fairly
does
encapsulate
the
question
that
the
parties
presented
to
the
court,
which
is
to
construe
the
contract,
the
question
that
the
bazzle
plurality
sent
back.
the
aaa
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
which
i
commend
to
the
court,
on
behalf
of
no
party
says
over
and
over
and
over
again,
we
drafted
the
rules
to
provide
procedures
to
answer
the
bazzle
contract
question.
we
have
no
opinion
about
the
answer
to
the
federal
statutory
question
that
arises
if
the
answer
to
the
--
the
meeting-of-the-minds
question
is
no
meeting
of
the
minds
as
a
matter
of
contract
law.
and
if
you
find
--
and
much
of
the
discussion
this
morning
has
focused
on
this
--
that,
well,
somehow
the
arbitrators
did
just
decide
the
meeting-of-the-minds
question,
they
didn't
decide
the
legal
consequences
of
no
meeting
of
the
minds,
then
just
as
in
keating
and
as
in
bazzle,
you
will
not
be
able
to
reach
the
very
important,
fundamental
faa
statutory
question
in
this
case.
and
the
next
generation
of
lawyers
will
come
before
you
or
your
successors
to
get
it
answered.
now,
as
to
the
contract
question,
i
do
want
to
address
your
point,
justice
breyer,
about
the
toolbox.
it
is
true
that
in
answering
the
contract
--
what
is
--
what
did
the
parties
intend?
was
there
really
a
meeting
of
the
minds
here?
and,
by
the
way,
let
me
just
say
that
when
ms.
pillard
says,
well,
we
don't
know
whether
the
parties
in
this
industry
agreed
or
disagreed,
all
of
the
--
the
evidence
was
undisputed
that
since
the
days
of
marco
polo
the
background
principle
in
maritime
law
has
been
bilateral,
rigorously
bilateral.
