but
that's
the
same
before
courts.
that's
no
different.
i
mean,
yes,
a
court
has
to
come
to
a
decision,
but
so
does
an
arbitrator.
and
i
really
--
i
really
don't
understand
what
it
means
to
say
that
the
contract
does
not
cover
it.
i
mean,
the
--
the
contract
either
requires
it
or
does
not
require
it.
and
if
the
contract
is
silent,
either
the
court
or
the
arbitrator
has
to
decide
what
is
the
consequence
of
that
silence,
in
light
of
the
background,
in
light
of
--
of
implied
understandings.
is
the
consequence
of
the
--
of
the
silence
that
a
class
arbitration
is
permitted,
or
is
the
consequence
of
the
silence
that
it
is
not?
but
those
are
the
only
answers.
the
contract
requires
it
or
the
contract
doesn't
require
it.
i
don't
know
anything
in
between
--
the
contract
is
silent.
if
the
contract
is
silent,
it's
up
to
the
court
or
the
arbitrator
to
decide
what
that
silence
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
have
to
agree
with
judge
posner
on
that?
i
mean
i
--
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
would
--
yes,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
waxman,
i
hope
you
are
going
to
have
time
to
go
through
(a),
(b),
and
(c)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
you
started
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
bet
you
were
thinking
you'd
be
able
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
--
where
do
they
say
that
they
were
interpreting
the
intent
of
the
parties,
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
permit
class
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me,
what
part
--
50?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
59a
to
start.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
49a.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
to
preclude.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
arbitrators
are
putting
the
choice
in
a
false
manner.
it
isn't
whether,
on
the
one
hand,
they
agreed
to
permit
it
or,
on
the
other
hand,
they
agreed
to
prohibit
it.
just
forget
about
the
latter.
they
must
have
agreed
to
permit
it.
where
did
the
arbitrators
say
they
agreed
--
they
agreed
to
permit
it?
not
simply,
they
did
not
agree
to
prohibit
it.
you
don't
have
to
agree
to
prohibit
everything
in
a
contract.
you
have
to
agree
to
permit
it.
that's
what
contracting
is
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
i
mean,
they
--
they
put
it
just
--
just
the
way
that
--
that
is
not
good
for
you.
"the
panel
is
struck
by
the
fact
that
respondents
have
been
unable
to
cite
any
post-bazzle
panels
or
arbitrators
that
construed
their
clauses
as
prohibiting
a
class
action.
"
that's
not
what
--
what
they
have
to
find.
they
must
find
positively
that
it
permits
a
class
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
give
me
some
language
that
says
that.
i
--
there
is
nothing
in
that
paragraph
that
says
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
language
you
can
point
to
is
that
--
is
that
50a?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
hanging
your
whole
--
your
whole
assertion
that
--
that
these
arbitrators
not
only
found
that
the
contract
did
not
prohibit
it,
but
found
that
the
contract
positively
authorized
class
action,
upon
that
language
on
50a?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"clear
language"
is
the
point
of
that
sentence.
"claimants
argue
that
bazzle
requires
clear
language
that
forbids
class
arbitration.
"
"the
panel,
however,
agrees
with
respondents
that
the
test
is
a
more
general
one.
"
"arbitrators
must
look
to
the
language
to
ascertain
the
parties'
intention
whether
they
intended
to
permit
or
to
preclude
class
action.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
of
those
two
sentences
is
simply
that
in
order
for
us
to
find
that
you
didn't
preclude
it
--
and
if
you
didn't
preclude
it,
it's
okay
--
you
don't
need
clear
language.
we
have
to
look
to
everything.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
how
i
read
the
two
sentences.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
used
to
teach
contracts.
did
you
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
used
to
teach
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
page?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
--
you
know,
that
doesn't
help
me
a
lot.
what
does
it
mean,
if
it
permits
it?
i
mean,
i
guess
you
could
say,
if
there's
a
background
rule,
that
whether
the
parties
agree
to
it
or
not,
it's
okay.
does
"permits
it"
mean
"authorizes
it"?
does
--
does
that
mean
whether
the
parties
have
agreed
to
it?
is
that
what
"permits"
mean
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
page
--
what
page
are
you
quoting
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
this
industry,
however.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
