ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether,
under
our
constitution,
the
power
to
prosecute
criminal
contempt
in
a
federal
court
rests
solely
with
the
sovereign.
the
united
states
now
agrees
that
the
fact
that
a
criminal
offense
may
only
be
prosecuted
by
the
sovereign
is
a
foundational
premise
of
our
constitution.
because
mr.
robertson
was
prosecuted
for
criminal
contempt
in
a
private
right
of
action,
his
prosecution
was
unconstitutional,
a
nullity
in
our
view,
and
his
convictions
must
be
vacated.
ms.
watson
defends
the
lower
court's
ruling
that--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--his
complaint
below
was
that
he
had
a
plea
agreement
with
the
united
states.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
and
that
the
only
lawful
or
constitutional
way
he
could
have
been
prosecuted
was
in
an
action
brought
by
the
united
states;
that
the
local
statute
didn't
authorize
a
private
right
of
action,
and
that
the
constitution
could
not--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--he
said
below
that
--
that
a
private
right
of
action
was
neither
lawful
under
the
local
statutes
nor
constitutional,
and
the
parties
responded
that
it
was;
and
the
lower
court
held
it
is
authorized
by
local
statute;
it's
constitutional;
in
fact,
this
was
a
private
right
of
action
prosecuted
by
ms.
watson
on
her
own
behalf
and
therefore
your
plea
agreement
fails.
we
have
never
argued,
if
it
was
actually
her
prosecuting,
that
--
that
she
was
bound
by
the
plea
agreement.
we
argued
it
can't
be
her
prosecuting,
it
can't
be
under
the
constitution,
it
can't
be
under
the
local
statute.
and
if
it's
the
united
states,
then
we
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
plea
agreement
we
had
with
the
united
states.
the
--
ms.
watson
defends
the
lower
court
ruling
that
a
private
right
of
criminal
action
is
constitutional,
but
really
has
mounted
--
excuse
me
--
mounted
very
little
attack
on
our
constitutional
argument
that
the
constitution
contemplates
that
crimes
are
public
wrongs
brought
on
behalf
of
sovereigns.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
well,
it's
important
to
clarify,
because
there
is
--
there
is
a
lack
of
--
it
is
not
parallel
to
the
federal
system.
so
even
assuming
--
and
i
believe
there
is
a
circuit
--
that
the
second
circuit
says
when
the
southern
district
signs
it's
the
southern
district
only,
and
the
third,
fourth,
eighth,
and
ninth
view
it
differently
when
something
reads
as
broadly
as
this,
which
is
the
government.
in
the
district
of
columbia--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--no.
no,
i
believe
in
the
second
circuit
they
might
read
something
signed
by
the
southern
district
as
not
binding
in
the
eastern
district.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
but
in
the
district
of
columbia,
only
the
united
states
attorney
prosecutes
criminal
offenses
of
the
type
that
occurred
here.
there
is
a
bit
of
a
red
herring
here
from
this
plea
form.
this
is
a
plea
form
that
is
used
in
superior
court
both
in
traffic
offenses,
which
are
the
type
of
offenses
that
the
district
of
columbia
prosecutes,
and
in
criminal
offenses.
and
the
cross-outs
are
just
to
conform
the
plea
form,
so
that
if
you
cross
out
d.c.>
["]
it
reads
v.
john
robertson>
["],
which
is
how--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--there
is
--
there
is
not
coordinate
jurisdiction.
there
is
some
--
some
provisions
for
consent
if
there
are
multiple
offenses
and
one
goes
to
one,
one
goes
to
the
other.
but
all
the
offenses
we're
talking
about
here
are
united
states
offenses.
it
was
the
united
states's
position
below
that
only
the
united
states
prosecutes
contempt.
it
was
actually
the
attorney
general's
conviction
in
the
lower
court
that
it
could
not,
representing
the
district
of
columbia,
prosecute
contempt.
so
that
if
we
are
construing
the
party
to
be
the
united
states
as
the
solicitor
general
now
asks
--
you
know,
young
and
providence
journal
really
apply,
which
is
then
the
prosecuting
entity
is
the
united
states,
whether
represented
by
a
private
prosecutor
or
by
a
united
states
attorney.
that's
a
very
different
situation
than
different
offices
or
--
because
the
district
of
columbia
could
not
be
prosecuting
this
case
representing
the
--
the
attorney
general
couldn't
be
prosecuting
this
case
representing
the
district
of
columbia
government.
that's
not
in
the
picture
as
an
option.
the
--
the
case
--
if
it's
prosecuted
by
a
sovereign,
it's
prosecuted
by
the
united
states,
and
the
only
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
is
now
making
is
that
that
wouldn't
bind
if
private
prosecutor
representing
the
united
states,
as
happened
in
young.
we
have
a
local
case
that
says
when
a
private
prosecutor
in
a
criminal
contempt
case
signs
the
plea
agreement
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
it's
a
binding
plea
agreement
and
binds
the
--
the
united
states.
so
the
cross-out
on
the
plea
form,
i
believe,
are
a
bit
of
a
red
herring.
the
cross-out
on
the
caption
just
makes
it
read
united
states
v.
john
robertson
in
a
felony,
which
is
the
only
way
felonies
can
be
prosecuted.
the
cross-out
on
the
signature
line
just
makes
it
read
the
united
states
attorney,
who
is
the
only
one
who
can
sign
such
a
form
in
a
felony
case.
and
it
doesn't
define
a
particular
prosecuting
entity
between
federal
and
state,
or
between
two
different
federal
jurisdictions
that
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over,
let's
say,
mail
fraud
or
something
like
that.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
i
--
the
--
the
same
procedure
is
a
question
of
how
that
is
defined.
if
the
question
is
whether
there
are
other
states
that
have
a
wholly
private
right
of
action
where
the
person
is
construed
as
bringing
it
on
her
own
behalf,
not
on
behalf
of
a
sovereign,
in
a
criminal
case,
we
have
seen
nothing--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--yes,
there
are
other
--
there
are
other
states
that
allow
the
complainant
to
either
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
the
form
of
a
request
for
an
order
to
show
cause
and
to
actually
prosecute
as
a
private
prosecutor,
the
way,
let's
say,
in
young,
they
would
have
characterized
a
private
prosecutor--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--i
am.
i
am
talking
about
criminal
contempt.
for
instance,
in
the
district
of
columbia
before
this
case
came
down
there
--
we
had
an
opinion,
based
on
a
local
legislature's
determination,
that
said
a
beneficiary
of
a
civil
protection
order
may
initiate
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
and
may
act
as
private
prosecutor
the
way
in
--
in
young
this
court
said
as
a
matter
of
supervisory
authorities
they
didn't
want
interested
parties.
there
are
jurisdictions,
i
believe,
that
allow
for
interested
parties
to
take
that
role.
but
the
role
is
the
role
of
the
lawyer
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign
--
sovereign,
whichever
sovereign
it
is,
who
is
the
ultimate
party--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--and
who
can
nolle
the
case.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
that's
absolutely
true.
in
our
view
to
the
extent
there
are
any
sort
of
exceptions
from
procedural
rights
or
the
normal
process
in
contempt
proceedings,
they
are
narrowly
tailored
and
governed
by
the
doctrine
of
necessity.
and
that
--
and
so
while
respondent's
counsel
indicates,
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
differences
in
contempt
and
just
add
one
to
this
list,
they
make
no
attempt
to
ground
that
in
the
document
of
necessity,
which
is
really
the
only
thing
that
--
that
justifies
any
sort
of
procedural
difference
in
the
contempt
context.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
yes.
well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
the
question
what
"this
procedure"
is.
the
district--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--yes.
the
--
the
district
had
a
case
where
it
said
it
believed
itself
not
bound
by
the
supervisory
authority
of
young
and
it
would
allow
interested
parties
to
prosecute
contempt
in
the
domestic
violence
context
only,
not
outside
the
domestic
violence
context.
and
it
has
had
cases
prosecuted
in
that
fashion
since
that
time,
which
i
believe
was
1984.
but
it
has
--
it
was
not
until
this
case
that
the
issue
arose
because
of
the
plea
agreement
to
suggest
that
that
person
was
prosecuting
in
her
own
name--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--i
--
i--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--well,
we
actually
see
two
arguments,
and
maybe
that's
--
that
we
are
making,
which
may
be
part
of
the
confusion.
if
this
proceeding
really
was,
as
the
lower
court
interpreted,
the
lower
court
--
the
lower
court
interpreted
the
local
statute
and
what
occurred
and
said:
this
really
was
a
private
right
of
action
brought
by
ms.
watson
on
her
own
behalf;
no
government
party
initiated
it,
controlled
it;
and
we
believe
that
is
constitutional.
that's
what
the
lower
court
said.
if
that's
what
occurred,
then
we
believe
this
court
could
well
say
that
is
unconstitutional.
we
--
we
defer
to
the
lower
court's
view
of
what
occurred
pursuant
to
the
local
statute.
this
was
a
private
right
of
action,
the
lower
court
told
us
so,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
can
tolerate
such
a
thing.
and,
therefore,
like
in
gompers
where
criminal
penalty
was
imposed,
gompers
v.
buck's
stove,
a
criminal
penalty
was
imposed
in
an
action
between
private
parties,
that
judgment
must
be
set
aside.
she
never
had
power
to
invoke
the
authority
of
the
court
in
the
first
place.
that's
one
way
to
view
it.
the
solicitor
general--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--the
lower
court
was
wrong.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
well--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--well,
i
think
that
the
second
way
to
view
it,
as
--
as
i
was
going
to
say,
is
what
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
now
agrees
--
they
thought
below
that
it
was
constitution,
but
they
now
agree
that
the
constitution
cannot
tolerate
private
criminal
rights
of
action.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
i
believe--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--and
certainly
since,
you
know,
since
they
made
the
argument
to
the
lower
courts.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
it
was
done
many
times,
received
--
when
the
original
--
when
the
interested
prosecutor
decision
was
made,
it
was
made
on
the
same
foundational
premise
as
young,
which
was
let's
look
and
see
if
we
are
concerned
about
conflict
of
interest.
by
the
nature
of
asking,
the
court
asking
questions
of
conflict
of
interest,
the
court
was
thinking
of
the
woman
as
representing
the
government.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
that's
true.
it
certainly
would
not
be--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--no,
no,
no,
no.
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
allowed
under
young.
but
to
finish
my
--
my
answer
to
justice
sotomayor
and
justice
stevens
as
to
the
second
route:
if
this
court
--
what
the
solicitor
general
i
believe
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
say
it's
not
constitutional
to
have
such
an
action
brought
on
behalf
of
a
private
party,
therefore,
construe
it
as
an
action
brought
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign.
this
court
--
if
this
court
goes
that
route,
as
opposed
to
deferring
to
the
way
the
lower
court
described
it,
rather
says
this
must
have
been
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign,
the
sovereign
was
the
united
states,
then
the
question
is
whether
the
plea
agreement
barred
it.
the
lower
court
said
the
plea
agreement
didn't
bar
it
because
it
was
ms.
watson's;
obviously
it
didn't
bar
it.
ms.
watson
is
not
the
united
states.
but
if
in
fact
it
was
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
then
the
question
is
does
the
plea
agreement
bar
it.
we
think
that
the--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--i
believe--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--i
--
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
justice
department,
but
i
do
believe--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--i
do
believe
that
they
--
that
they
concede
that
the
--
the
relevant
sovereign
is
the
united
states.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
yes.
and--
[laughter]
but
--
but
i
believe
that's
what
their
brief
said.
they
certainly
said
that
below
and
i
believe
that's
what
they
are
saying
here
because
they
are
saying
it's
prosecution
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
they
have
given
section
518
permission
in
this
case
because
they
believe
that
the
united
states
is
interested.
and
so
the
district
of
columbia's
role,
oddly
enough,
all
the
way
through
this
proceeding
and
then
they
withdrew
at
the
merits
stage
in
this
court,
was
they
believed
themselves
representing
the
petitioner.
they
had
never
perceived
themselves
to
be
a
public
prosecutor.
and
they
in
fact
said
in
the
lower
court
that
they
had
no
authority
to
prosecute
contempt
in
the
district
of
columbia.
we
agree
with
that.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
you
know,
i
--
i
think
that
the
question
is
--
i
don't
think
--
i
disagree
with
the
government,
with
respondents
that
this
court
has
said
it
hasn't.
i
think
in
--
i
think
springer
appears
to
apply
separation
of
powers
principles.
i
think
that
metropolitan
airport
authority
used
springer
in
a
separation
of
powers
--
a
constitutional
separation
of
powers
analysis.
i
think
even
if
this
court
looks
at
whalen,
which
involves
d.c.,
we
will
see
a
separation
of
powers
analysis
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia.
our--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--i
don't
think
we
are
a
territory,
no.
no,
it
is
article
i
power
that
is
being
exercised.
our
focus
hasn't
been
entirely
separation
of
powers,
because
in
our
view,
you
know,
separation
of
powers
is
about
the
division
of
powers
within
government.
here
the
problem
was
that
the
problem
was
that
the
--
there
is
no
authority
under
the
constitution
to
give
the
power
to
prosecute
time,
which
has
historically,
way
back,
been
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
and
to
take
it
entirely
away
from
the
sovereign
at
all.
which
is
what
--
what
the
lower
court
finding
was
and
what
ms.
watson
now
defends.
but
we
see
a
long,
long
history
in
the
common
law,
in
the
english
common
law,
in
our
common
law,
and
in
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
of
criminal
actions
being
public
wrongs
prosecuted
acting
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign
and
criminal
contempt
falling
right
within
that
even
more
so,
because
this
is
indication
of
public
authority,
and
to
the
extent
there
are
any
deviations
from
due
process
or
separation
of
powers
principles,
they
are
justified
only
by
the
doctrine
of
necessity.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
my--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--for
criminal
contempt?
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
yes.
now
whether
--
whether
in
some
situations
a
private
prosecutor
could
be
appointed--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--on
their
own
behalf?
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
so.
not
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
we
are
drawing
a
fairly
rigid
distinction
between
who
the
lawyer
is
and
who
the
lawyer
represents.
in
our
view,
the
party
in
a
criminal
action
has
to
be
the
sovereign,
the
united
states.
now
in
the
contempt
context
there
is
a
limited
exception
for
appointment
of
private
prosecutors
when
the
executive
is
declining
to
prosecute
and
the
judiciary
needs
to
vindicate
its
authority,
and
if
it's
referred
to
the
public
prosecutor
in
the
young
situation
and
the
public
prosecutor
has
declined
but
the
judiciary
still
needs
to
vindicate
its
authority,
it
can
appoint
a
private
attorney
to
represent
the
sovereign.
but
at
root
it's
the
sovereign
that
is
prosecuting,
no
matter
who
the
lawyer
is
who
is
standing
in
the
courtroom.
and
the
problem
in
this
case
was
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
that
said
--
that
ms.
watson
--
it
was
her
case.
the
prosecutor
said
it
was
her
case;
the
lawyer
said
i
can't
control
her;
she
gets
to
make
all
the
decisions.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
i
think
the
strongest
case
is
gompers
v.
buck's
stove.
that
says
fundamentally
--
and
i'm
not
quoting
verbatim
--
but
it
says
fundamentally
erroneous
as
if
a
tort
action
of
a
--
for
battery
of
a
versus
b,
a
sentence
of
12
months
is
imposed.
well,
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here,
is
we
have
a
sentence
of
12
months
imposed
for
an
action
that
our
lower
court
said
was
solely
between
private
parties.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
yes,
i
do.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
right.
my
view
is
this
court
should
go
with
the
third
and
fourth
circuits
who
have
--
expressed
--
quite
eloquently
about
the
united
states
not
being
a
bunch
of
separate
fiefdoms,
but
that
when
the
united
states
speaks,
they
speak
for
the
government
at
large.
that
is
different
than
a
case
--
of
some
of
the
cases
that
were
cited,
where
it
says
the
united
states
will
make
a
recommendation
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
and
then
the
criminal
defendant
comes
back
and
says
well,
the
ins
is
down,
too.
and
people
looks
at
the
agreement
and
say
well,
no
one
would
have
read
that
to
mean
that
the
united
states
included
ins,
because
they
were
talking
about
a
recommendation
to
ins.
but
when
the
government
has
written
in,
my
view
is
that
--
that
the
third
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
speak
eloquently
to
that.
but
i
don't
see
that
that
issue
is
presented
here,
given
the
context
on
which
it
arises
in
d.c.
where
this
is
conduct
that
should
only
be
prosecuted
in
d.c.
court
by
the
united
states.
it
was
going
to
be
the
united
states
attorney
or
a
private
prosecutor
representing
the
united
states.
we
have
local
law
that
says
private
prosecutors
do
sign
plea
agreements
bind
the
united
states
and
i
would
think
the
converse
would
be
true.
i'll
reserve.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
thank
you.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
thank
you.
i
just
want
to
say
in
response
both
to
--
to
mr.
long's
comments,
that
a
lack
record
as
to
what
actually
occurred
or
the
general
comment,
about
whether
or
not
ms.
watson
was
treated
as
a
state
actor
--
i
actually
think
there
is
a
--
a
decent
record
in
this
case
that
what
occurred
was
not
a
motion
to
request
the
court
to
issue
a
show
cause,
but
in
fact,
a
--
a
motion
that
requested
--
that
triggered
a
ministerial
act,
which
was
an
act
--
which
was
used
as
a
charging
document,
which
the
judge
believed
she
had
no
discretion,
and
the
assistant
attorney
general,
who
was
representing
the
petitioner,
believed
she
had
no
discretion
to
control,
and
ms.
watson
was
treated
as
bringing
the
action
on
her
own
behalf.
that's
what
the
lower
court
held
as
a
factual
matter,
and
i
think
it
is
quite
supported
by
the
record.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
if
you
--
yes.
the
issue
is
whether
she
could
constitutionally
bring
the
case
on
her
own.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
we
absolutely
raise
that
because
our
argument
from
--
from
the
very
beginning
was
she
can't
constitutionally
be
representing
herself
in
this
proceeding.
if
this
is
happening
constitutionally,
she
represents
the
united
states,
and
if
she
represents
the
united
states,
then
our
plea
agreement
bars
it
because
our
plea
agreement
was
with
the
government.
it
indicated
the
government
will
not
--
will
not
pursue,
and
any
reasonable
person
in
a--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--yes,
and
at
the
time
that
we
signed
the
plea
agreement,
there
was
no
precedent
for
the
notion
of
a
private
person
bringing
a
criminal
action
in
her
own
name,
interest
and
on
her
own
behalf.
no
one
would
have
contemplated
that
such
a
thing
was
constitutional,
because
you
know,
back
until
appeals
of
felonies--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--i'm
sorry.
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
sure
that
i'm
understanding,
or
that
my
words
haven't
been
misinterpreted.
it's
certainly
not
the
case
that
when
my
--
that
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
plea
agreement
was
that
it
wouldn't
apply
to
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
the
only--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--even
if
he
gave
up
the
right
of
a
private
person
to
prosecute
on
her
own
behalf?
any
agreement--
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
--i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that
we
did,
because
i
am
not
sure
that
i
--
i
understand
the
question.
i
--
i
know
that
we
did
make
the
argument
that
it
could
only
have
lawfully
been
brought
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign,
and
that
the
sovereign
was
the
united
states.
and
so
our
view
was
if
this
court
views
it
the
way
the
lower
court
did,
which
was
as
an
action
between
private
parties,
then
it's
unconstitutional
under
gompers.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
absolutely.
ms.
jaclyn
s.
frankfurt
absolutely.
i
think
we
wrote
the
word,
you
know,
"whoever
stands
in
the
well
of
the
courtroom,
it
doesn't
matter
who
that
person
is;
that
person
represents
the
sovereign.
"
that's
the
only
constitutional
way.
if
it's
viewed
that
way,
it's
barred
by
the
plea
agreement.
if
it's
not
viewed
that
way,
as
the
lower
court
construed
the
local
statute
to
permit,
then
gompers
v.
buck's
stove
does
--
there
is
no
authority
there
to
impose
a
criminal
penalty.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse.
