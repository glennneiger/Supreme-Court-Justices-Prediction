mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
very
important
to
be
clear
about
what
is
properly
before
the
court.
this
started
out
as
a
case
about
a
plea
agreement,
and
the
petitioner's
claim
is
that
his
plea
agreement
with
the
u.s.
attorney
barred
his
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
he
has
not
made
the
claim
that
a
private
interested
party
may
not
bring
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
he
has
said--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
mean
if
i
could,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
i
think
several
questions
in
the
case,
and
some
are
actually
no
longer
in
dispute
so
that
will
help
to
simplify
a
very
complicated
matter
a
little
bit.
one
is
according
to
the
question
presented,
whether
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
for
violating
a
civil
protective
order
must
be
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states,
so
actually
have
united
states
in
the
caption.
and
i
think
now
all
the
parties
agree,
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
the
caption
of
the
case
actually
say
"united
states".
so
to
the
extent
that
answers
the
question
about
what
does
the
plea
agreement
cover,
we
don't
have
a
dispute
about
that.
there's
no
constitutional
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
be
reversed.
so
the
other
part
of
the
question,
as
it's
framed
in
the
question
is
does
it
have
to
be
brought
pursuant
to
the
power
of
the
united
states.
that's
not
language
that
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
is
the
real
party
in
interest
the
united
states?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
i
agree,
that's
mostly
what
we
have
to
talk
about
this
morning,
but
i'm
trying
to
bracket
it
with
issues
that
are
really
not
properly
in
dispute
here.
one
is,
the
caption
is
not
a
constitutional
issue.
another
is,
as
petitioner
has
said
over
and
over
again,
the
actual
ability
of
a
private,
interested
party,
the
question
that
was
left
open
in
young,
under
the
constitution,
under
the
due
process
clause
or
under
separation
of
powers,
is
that
constitutional
for
ms.
watson
to
even
do
this,
as
the
representative
of
the
united
states
or
on
her
own
behalf?
they
have
said
over
and
over
again,
they
are
not
raising
that
question.
in
their
reply
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
say
they
in
no
way
challenge
that.
in
their
post-argument
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
say
the
assertion
that
they
are
challenging
it
is
just
wrong.
in
their
supplemental
brief
to
this
court
at
the
cert
stage,
they
say
they
--
they
decline
to
raise
that
question.
and
even
in
their
reply
brief
here,
they
say
they
have
not
raised
the
issue
left
unresolved
in
young.
so
that
is
a
very
important
issue.
and
i
think
that
issue
is
really--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that's
the
issue
of
whether
a
private
interested
party,
either
on
their
own
behalf
or
as
the
representative
of
the
sovereign,
can
bring
a
criminal
contempt
action.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
narrow
down
to--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
--
i
think
the
--
all
they
have
conceded
is
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
are
going
to
assume
that
--
well,
i
may
have
given
you
the
wrong
answer
to
you
--
we
are
--
they
have
said
over
and
over
again,
we
assume,
that
a
private
interested
party
can
bring
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
and
so
we
think,
given
the
importance
of--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
--
i
think
that
question
is
fairly
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
maybe
a
different
way
of
making
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the
point
is,
they
are
not
disputing,
and
they've
said
over
and
over
again
they're
not
disputing
that
a
private,
interested
individual,
like
ms.
watson,
the
individual
in
this
case,
can
bring
this
proceeding.
now--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
the
issue
that
i
think
is
before
the
court
is,
would
that
be
as
a
representative
of
the
united
states
or
would
that
be
as
a
private
person?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
i
think
they
have
not
challenged
that.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
and
i
will
say,
there
is
an
oddity
to
this,
because
in
many
ways,
the
bigger
question
is
the
question
that
the
court
left
open
in
young,
since
that's
not
been
properly
raised,
not
properly
decided,
by
the
court
below,
not
properly
briefed,
it
is
a
little
odd
to
be
answering
this
other
question
of:
well,
assuming
that
the
private
party
can
do
this,
would
it
be
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
right.
and
my--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--exactly.
exactly.
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--so
let
me
now
address
the
point
that:
is
it
a
constitutional
requirement?
no
matter
what
the
legislature
says,
that
any
criminal
contempt
proceeding
must
be
brought
in
the
interest
of
the
sovereign,
not
in
the
interest
of
a
private
party.
that
may
seem
like
a
fairly
obvious
proposition,
but
i
want
to
submit
it's
actually
much
harder
than
the
court
actually
should
agree.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
the
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
who
is
the
real
party
in
interest?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no.
i
want
to
make
an
argument
that
actually,
the
d.c.
legislature
and
the
d.c.
courts
are
constitutionally
permitted
to
determine
that
in
this
specific
situation,
the
interests
of
the
individual
actually
predominate
over
the
interests
of
the
government
and
there
is
not
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
you
completely
justice
alito.
the
ultimate
question
is
exactly
what
you
say.
and
we
think
under
any
reasonable
construction
of
the
plea
agreement,
it
does
not
bar
this
proceeding.
as
justice
stevens
said,
these
have
gone
on
for.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
will
make
the
argument,
although
if
i
am
wrong,
i
still
think
the
plea
agreement
doesn't
bar
this
prosecution.
here's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
it's
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
understood
justice
alito,
when
the
plea
agreement
says,
crosses
out
district
of
columbia,
crosses
out
corporation
counsel,
and
we
are
now
all
agreed
that
ms.
watson,
in
her
own
name,
can
bring
this
proceeding
under
a
statute
that
authorizes
it
and
has
for
20
years--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
that's
--
now
we
are
getting
into
statutory
issues,
justice
alito.
i
mean,
this
case
is
a
constitutional
case,
with
no
such
statutory
issue
was
raised
or
decided
by
the
court
below.
typically,
this
court
treats
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
as
--
as
final,
as
a
practical
matter,
on
issues
of
d.c.
law.
so,
i
think
that
is
going
off
in
a
completely
different
direction.
but
on
the
issue--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
issue
is,
it's
a
matter
of
d.c.
statute.
there
was
some
problem
with
this
prosecution.
i
mean,
that's
really
something
else.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
and
let
me
make
that
argument.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
if
--
if
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
it
is
in
blackstone,
we
admit
that,
for
crimes
in
general,
but
we
are
talking
about
contempt.
but
if
it's
a
constitutional
requirement,
it
has
got
to
be
in
the
constitution
someplace.
petitioners
say
it's
because
the
constitution
uses
words
like
"crimes".
well,
you
know,
the
court
has
been
very
cautious
about
implying
common
law
rules,
constitutionalizing
common
law
rules,
because
of
words
in
the
constitution--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
if
you
will
bear
with
me,
i
think
the
constitution
does
answer
questions
like
the
brady
question,
but
it's
not
the
penumbras
and
emanations
of
words
like
crimes.
it's
because--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
--
i
think
because
the
way
--
the
way
this
court
has
defined
criminal
contempt
does
not
look
to
the
interest
of
the
party
versus
the
interest
of
the
sovereign;
in
fact,
the
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
in
bagwell
and
hicks
and
other
cases
that
in
all
criminal
contempt
cases,
civil
and
criminal,
to
some
extent
the
interest
of
the
sovereign
is
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--due
process
says
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding,
your
honor,
if
i
can
explain
in
a
minute,
and
therefore,
all
the
due
process
rights
of
a
--
for
a
petty
criminal
offense
apply.
and
i
would
say
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--d.c.
courts
do
provide
lawyers
if
the
--
to
the
defendant.
i
mean
a
very
important
point
here
is
these
are
often
pro
se
cases,
where
the
woman
comes
in
to
say
--
or
the
petitioner;
it's
usually
a
woman,
it
doesn't
have
to
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--they
--
they
come
from
the
due
process
clause.
and
if
i
could
have
just
the
court's
indulgence
for
one
minute,
i
think
the
answer
to
a
lot
of
these
questions
is
not
looking
to
penumbras
and
emanations
from
crimes,
but
looking
at
this
court's
decisions
deciding
what
is
criminal
contempt
and
what
is
civil
contempt.
and
as
i
started--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--this
is
a
determinate
sentence,
so
under
this
court's
cases,
without
regard
to
whether
the
government's
interests
are
--
take
precedence
over
the
private
interests,
it's
criminal.
so
you
get
all
the
rights
that
the
due
process
clause
gives
you
in
a--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
in
this
case
the
court
said
that
the
brady
rights
did
apply.
i
mean,
this
is
another
reason
why
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
try
to
decide
a
number
of
very
important
questions
about
a
very
important
system
that
has
not
really
been
properly
presented
in
d.c.--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
there
are
--
it
may
be
that
this
is
the
wrong
case.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
part
--
part
of
the
answer
is,
of
course,
that
the
court
exercises
control.
another
part
of
the
answer
is
that
the
d.c.
legislature,
which
is
exercising
delegated
legislative
authority
from
congress,
has
determined
that
this
is
in
the
public
interest.
and
you
know,
the
third
part
of
it
is
that
we
are
not
granting
these
private
individuals
excessive
authority.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
but
--
but
you
know,
d.c.
tried
for
over
a
decade
to
do
this
with
public
prosecutors,
and
there
just
were
not
enough
resources.
so
what
we
are
allowing
here,
if
i
could
take
it
a
stop--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well
--
there
may--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
there
is
a
long,
long
tradition
of
having
private
individuals
undertake
prosecutions
of
crimes.
i
mean,
so
what
you're
saying--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--on
behalf
of.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but
--
but
justice
scalia,
we
are
dealing
with
the
district
of
columbia.
the
constitution
does
not
assign
any
powers
over
the
district
to
the
executive
or
to
the
judicial
branch.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well
--
and
again,
there
is
abundant
historical
precedent
for
that.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
if--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think
there
would
be
today
serious
due
process
problems
to
work
through
with
that
sort
of
system.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
would
also
say
the
framers
would
have
understood
that
to
be
a
perfectly
normal
system.
they
would
not
have
thought
it
was
unconstitutional,
because
private
prosecutions
were
--
were
common
at
the
time
of
the
framers.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
mean
there
--
that
issue
is
debated
in
the
briefs
and
i
think
it
was
less
common
in
the
colonies
in
the
united
states
than
it
was
in
britain,
but
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
regarded
as
--
as
unconstitutional.
but
this
is
--
now
we
are
back
to
the
question
that
i
say
really
the
court
should
not
decide
because
it
was
never
properly
--
whether
this
can
be
done
by
a
private
individual
at
all,
even
as
the
representative
of
the
government.
so
i
don't
think
you
should
get
into
that.
but
if
you
do--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
you
could
wait
for
a
case
that
presents
it
--
that
properly
presents
it,
where
it
can
be
decided--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
and
that
--
that
is
something
that
the
court
we
think
could
properly
decide.
but
justice
breyer,
i
would--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
we
--
we
are
arguing
two
things.
they
can
bring
it
in
their
own
name,
that's
not
unconstitutional;
and
they
can
certainly
--
they
could
certainly
bring
it
as
the
representative
of
the
government,
that
is
also
constitutional.
and
--
and
so
there
are
two
ways--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
absolutely.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
because
the
d.c.
council
said
they
could
do
it.
so
we
have
a
legislature
that
has
said
that
the
interest
of
a
private
party
here
takes
precedence,
and
that
is
not
an
unconstitutional
determination
by
the
legislature.
in
this
court's
criminal
contempt
cases,
the
court
has
said
we
don't
look
to
whose
interest
is
paramount
or
what
this
--
the
legislature
or
what
the
court
says
whose
interest
is
paramount.
we
recognize
that
both
kinds
of
contempt,
civil
and
criminal,
further
the
sovereign's
interest
in
vindicating
the
court's
orders
and
further
the
private
interest
in
seeing
that
that
order
which
applies
particularly
to
that
party
is
followed.
so
you
don't
look
to
that
at
all.
you
just
look
to
the
nature
of
the
punishment.
and
if
it's
a
determinate
sentence
versus
a
coercive
sentence,
then
it's
criminal.
so
that
answers
all
the
questions
about
brady
and
what
sort
of
due
process--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
you
know,
i
think
that
would
be
an
unfortunate
result
in
the
sense
that,
you
know,
the
plea
agreement
in
our
view
doesn't
prevent
this
prosecution
on
any
reasonable
interpretation.
you
know,
we
also
think
for
the
reasons
i
have
been
trying
to
spell
out
that
there
is
no
real
basis
for
the
court
to
hold
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
only
in
the
criminal
contempt
setting,
for
the
d.c.
legislature
to
find
that
the
private
interest
here
justifies
allowing
the
private
party
to
bring
this
action
but
it's
still
criminal.
because
it's
a
determinate
sentence,
you
get
all
the
due
process
just
as
you
would
as
--
if
the
government
brought
it.
you
get
all
the
due
process
rights
which
in
fact
the
defendant
did
get
here.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
and
that
--
and,
you
know--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
mr.
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia,
i
mean,
this
is
a
system
that
is
in
all
the
states.
it's
not
just
domestic
violence.
it's
child
custody.
it's
child
support.
the
amicus
briefs
say
this
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well
--
well,
but
--
yes.
criminal
contempt
for
violation
of
court
orders
about
domestic
violence,
about
child
custody,
about
child
support.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
amicus
briefs
at
--
19
allow
--
at
this
point,
19
allow
you
to
file
a
motion.
these
things
are
typically
begun
by
motion,
not
a
charging
document.
and
just
say--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
absolutely,
justice
kennedy.
and
that's
really
what
we're
asking.
i
mean,
if
you
think
about
these
situations,
many
thousands
of
cases,
most
of
these
individuals
have
no
lawyers.
they
are
pro
se.
a
civil
order
is
entered,
about
domestic
violence,
child
custody,
child
support.
it's
violated,
or
the
individual
thinks
it's
violated.
what
do
they
do?
they
come
to
the
court
on
their
own,
so
now
they
are
pro
se,
so
now
maybe
we're
in
the
furies
and
young
and
province.
but
this
is
--
to
make
the
system
work,
we
at
least,
i
submit,
have
to
allow
those
individuals
to
come
to
the
court
and
file
a
motion,
even
though
they
are
interested
in,
say,
somebody's
violating
the
order,
judge,
you
should
do
something
about
it--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--no.
no.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
mean,
that's
what
--
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
it
so
happens
this
woman
was
represented
by
the
d.c.
attorney
general,
who
is
a
public
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
if
i
could
--
if
i
can
just
do
it
step
by
step.
i
mean,
in
this
case
and
in
tens
of
thousands
of
other
cases,
the
first
step
is
just
allowing
that
motion
to
be
filed.
and
if
you
don't
allow
that,
you
say
that's
unconstitutional,
the
entire
system
will
--
will
blow
up.
so
if
you
at
least
get
to
that,
then
we
say,
well
--
the
judge
looks
at
it
and
says,
well,
civil's
not
appropriate
here
because
the
violation
is
over;
if
i
am
going
to
punish
this,
it's
going
to
have
to
be
a
determinant
sentence,
that's
criminal.
at
that
point,
under
this
court's
cases,
due
process
requires
all
sorts
of
things
to
protect
the
defendant.
he
gets
a
lawyer,
or
the
other
--
now,
it
would
say,
you
don't
have
--
the
constitution
doesn't
require
that
there
be
a
lawyer
appointed
to
prosecute
every
one
of
these,
or
that
would
be
my
submission.
so
let
the
individual
come
in
and
file
a
motion.
let
the
court
come
in
and
look
at
it.
don't
require
a
prosecutor
to
be
appointed,
interested
or
disinterested.
and
then
at
that
point,
if
the
court
is
exercising
sufficient
control
over
this,
to
say
if
--
if
the
person,
the
woman,
happens
to
have
that
lawyer,
that
lawyer
has
to
just
stand
aside
and
can't
play
any
role--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
you
know,
we
have
no
record
on
any
of
this,
justice
scalia,
because
it
was
not--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
way
the
statute
and
the
court
rules
read
is
you
file
a
motion,
not
an
indictment
or
an
information,
a
motion
to
hold
the
person
in
contempt.
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
set
down
for
a
hearing.
i
mean,
that's
sort
of
the
way
the
family
court
works.
so
they
will
have
a
hearing
and
the
judge
will
look
at
it,
will
see
what's
going
on,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--you
know,
i
am
very
uncomfortable
to
spend
--
i
have
gone
and
observed
one
of
these
and
i've
talked
to
one
of
the
judges,
but
none
of
this
is
in
the
record,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
i
think
what
they
typically
do
is
try
to
figure
out
what
it's
about,
whether
it's
civil
or
criminal.
if
it's
criminal,
they
would
appoint
a
lawyer
for
the
defendant
and
then
they
would
take
it
from
there,
but
this
is
a--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
they
can
--
they
can
agree
to
withdraw.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
again,
none
of
this
is
in
the
record.
my
understanding
is,
that
doesn't
happen,
although
i
am
honestly
not
sure.
i
think
it
would
be
up
to
the
court
to
--
to--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
you
know,
i
have
no
information
about
whether
that
sort
of
thing
happens
or
how
the
court
would
treat
it.
but
i
think
my
basic
point
is,
you
know,
this
is
a
very
important
system,
not
just
to
the
district
of
columbia,
but
to
the
whole
country.
and
the
details--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
the
details
matter.
and
to
change
it
to
a
system
where
we
now
say
there
have
to
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
--
but
d.c.,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--is
like
a
state
in
the
sense
that
separation
of
powers--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--if
you
look
at
them
--
if
you
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
palmore.
i
mean,
we
are
dealing
with
an
article
i
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
not
an
article
iii
court,
to
the
extent
that
the
sovereign's
interest
is
at
stake
here.
let's
keep
the
interest
of
that
article
i
court.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
you
mean
the
relief
for
contempt?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
honest
answer
is,
justice
breyer,
you
can
find
some
of
these
things
by
looking
around,
but
since
we've
been
talking
about
issues
that
were
not
properly
litigated
and
not
decided
and
we
do
not
have
a
well-developed
record,
some
of
these
things
are
just
not
going
to
be
available.
and
again,
we
think
--
you
know,
this
case
started
out
about
a
plea
agreement.
it's
really
a
small
case.
we
are
now
talking
about
these
great
big
issues.
we
think
the
plea
agreement
doesn't
bar
this
under
any
reasonable
construction,
and
so
the
right
result
is
either
to
dismiss
the
cases
as
improvidentally
granted
or
to
affirm.
