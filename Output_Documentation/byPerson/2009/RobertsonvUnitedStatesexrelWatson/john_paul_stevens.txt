justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
right
that
the
district
has
been
following
this
procedure
for
quite
some
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
where
a
private
party
initiates,
the
beneficiary
of
an
order
of
this
kind,
initiates
a
contempt
proceeding
against
a
person
who
violates
it,
and
seeks
a
punishment
for
it,
not
just
discontinuance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
to
me
that
the
plea
agreement
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
sort
of
an
inherent
violation
of
the
constitution
by
adopting
this
procedure
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
trouble
figuring
out
whether
the
plea
agreement
has
any
relevance
to
the
kind
of
basic
argument
you
are
making.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
--
if
that's
true,
they
have
been
following
an
unconstitutional
practice
for
about
25
years;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
nobody
thought
about
it
in
all
this
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
is
done
many,
many
times,
as
i
understand
it,
over
the
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
--
i
have
this
question.
this
--
again,
i'm
trying
to
see
the
case
in
the
broad
--
in
the
broader
sense.
supposing
there
is
a
civil
lawsuit
that's
settled
and
part
of
the
settlement
is
a
consent
decree
that
would
enjoin
certain
conduct,
and
the
defendant
then
violates
the
decree
and
engages
in
the
prohibited
conduct.
are
you
saying
that
the
only
person
who
could
prosecute
for
contempt
would
be
the
sovereign?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
no,
the
question
would
be
whether
the
lawyer
for
the
--
the
party
who
entered
into
the
settlement
could
bring
a
contempt
proceeding
against
the
adversary
who
had
violated
the
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
the
best
authority
from
this
court
for
your
basic
proposition
is?
what
is
your
strongest
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
gompers
is
the
best
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
i
understand
your
position
that
in
this
particular
case
the
u.s.
attorney
could
have
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
that
would
have
bound
the
respondent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
d.c.
circuit
--
the
d.c.
and
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree,
i
take
it,
that
the
attorney
for
the
district
of
columbia
could
have
bound
respondent?
somebody
could
bind
respondent
without
respondent
even
knowing
about
it,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
