is
this
law
unique
to

do
other
states

problem
that
they
are
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
is
domestic
violence.
and
the
prosecutors
are
busy
prosecuting
drug
crimes
and
the
rest.

district's
solution
is,
we
will
allow
the
abused
person
to
initiate
this
criminal
contempt.

there
other
states
that

i
mean,
however
you
describe
it
in
practical
terms,
are
there
other
places
that

person,
you
can
initiate
this
and

your
lawyer
present
it,
whether
it's
on
behalf
of
the
state
or
--
but
just
the
practical
of
how
you
go
through
the
motions;
are
there
other
states
that
allow
the
victim?

well,
we
can
ask
the
government.
