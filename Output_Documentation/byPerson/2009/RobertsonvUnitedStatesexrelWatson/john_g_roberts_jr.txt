chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-6261,
robertson
v.
united
states,
ex
rel.
watson.
ms.
frankfurt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
long.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
the
argument
is
that
because
a
private
interested
party
can't
bring
it,
the
party
is
bringing
it
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
his
plea
agreement
therefore
is
with
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
representative
of
the
sovereign?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
nobody
doubts
--
i
didn't
think
it
was
at
issue
that
the
united
states,
rather
than
operating
through
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
can
appoint
you
to
handle
the
prosecution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
what
they
don't
dispute,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
that's
--
they
don't
dispute
that?
that's
the
point
you
were
trying
to
make?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
one
way
you
can
find
it
in
the
constitution
is
that
we
have
built
a
body
of
law
about
the
obligation
of
people
bringing
prosecutions
that
wouldn't
fit
within
your
situation.
for
--
what
are
the
brady
--
what's
the
brady
obligation
of
your
client?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
are
the
brady
obligations
of
your
client?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
are
the
brady
obligations
of
your
client?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
unless
you
think
it's
a
violation
of
due
process
for
an
interested
party
to
be
able
to
criminally
prosecute
someone
at
their
--
at
their
discretion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
are
in
every
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
can
your
private
prosecutor,
however
you
want
to
describe
her,
could
she
enter
into
a
plea
agreement
with
the
defendant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
she
said
you
could
be
subject
to
you
180
days;
i
will
agree,
and
you'll
plead
guilty
to
30
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
kagan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
--
that's
absolutely
startling.
the
different
u.s.
attorneys
all
work
for
your
boss,
right?
they
work
for
the
attorney
general.
how
can
one
part
of
the
attorney
general
agree
to
something
that
doesn't
bind
the
other
part
of
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
your
word
for
it.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
or
maybe
not,
but
surely
it
binds
the
new
jersey
u.s.
attorney.
if
you
--
just
think
about
it.
the
--
the
u.s.
attorney
from
the
southern
district
says:
look,
you
agree
to
go
to
jail
for
10
years
and
i
will
drop
these
3
charges.
done.
then
the
u.s.
attorney
for
new
jersey
can
come
in
and
prosecute
under
those
three
charges?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
get
--
i
mean,
you
are
a
defendant.
you
have
to
go
to
all
more
than
50,
all
the
u.s.
attorney's
offices
and
say,
will
you
agree
to
this
and
get
everybody
to
sign
off?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
can't
do
that.
if
the
u.s.
attorney
in
new
jersey
has
the
authority
to
prosecute
this,
the
u.s.
attorney
in
new
york
can't
say,
oh,
and
by
the
way
i
bind
all
the
other
u.s.
attorneys.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
usually
we
have
questions
the
other
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
could
i
ask
you
could
a
1983
or
i
guess
bivens
action
be
brought
against
ms.
watson?
the
defendant,
you
know,
it
turns
out
he's
not
guilty
and
he
thinks
there
was
malice.
could
he
bring
a
bivens
action
against
her?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
she's
a
state
actor.
she's
acting
on
behalf
either
of
the
united
states
or
the
district
of
columbia.
therefore,
she
can
be
sued
directly
and
be
personally
liable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
ms.
frankfurt,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
