justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
he
didn't
make
that
argument,
though.
i
mean,
his
--
as
i
recall,
his
only
complaint
was
that
he
had
been
promised
that
--
that
he
wouldn't
be
--
he
wouldn't
be
prosecuted.
and
that
was
his
only
complaint
below,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
made
the
constitutional
claim
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it's
not
just
the
southern
district;
it's
also
what,
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
did
puzzle
me.
i
was
wondering
if
there's
--
if
there's
coordinate
jurisdiction.
can
the
--
can
the
district
prosecute
for
crimes
that
the
attorney
general
can
prosecute
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
of
course--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
states
don't
have
the
same
compulsion
that
the
federal
government
has,
which
arises
from
the
separation
of
powers.
and
--
which
--
which
means
that
it
is
the
executive
that
has
the
right
to
prosecute,
and
states
are
not
bound
by
such
a
thing.
and
they
can
perhaps
allow
private
individuals
to
prosecute,
whereas
the
only
exception
we
have
made
from
the
--
from
the
chief
executive's
authority
to
prosecute
is
young,
which
is
a
very
narrow
exception,
dealing
with
the
court's
ability
to
protect
itself
from
contempt
of
its
orders.
and
here
the
court
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
appointment
of
this
private
party,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
wouldn't
be
allowed
under
young.
i
mean,
if
young
made
anything
clear
is
you
couldn't
appoint
as
a
prosecutor
an
interested
party.
and
here
is
the
most
the
interested
party
of
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
don't
--
don't
--
don't
say
that
young
would
have
allowed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
--
does
the
justice
department
concede
that
the
sovereign
here
is
the
united
states?
does
the
justice
department
concede--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
there
can't
be
a
separate
prosecutor
from
--
from
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
that
is
the
prosecutor
for
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
understand
them
to
be
saying
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
district
a
territory?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean?
not
on
their
own
--
not
on
their
own
behalf.
i
mean,
that
--
that's
a
quite
different
issue.
that's
the
issue
that
was
decided
below,
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
a
private
interested
party
can
be
authorized
to
bring
the
suit
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
you
--
you
covered
two
things.
you
said
whether
a
private
individual
can
bring
it
on
his
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
whether
a
private
individual
can
be
appointed
to
bring
it
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
it
was
only
--
only
the
second
of
these
that
you
say
is
out
of
the
case.
you
say
the
first
is
out
of
the
case,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
"in
the
interest
of"?
on
behalf
of?
is
that
what
you
mean?
are
you
saying
--
you
acknowledge
here
that
it
is
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
but
you
say
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
are
you
asserting
that
this
suit
has
been
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
by
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
have
really
lost
you.
what
is
going
off
in
a
different
direction?
really?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
okay.
you're
--
you're
asserting
that
this
agreement
with
the
united
states
attorney
cannot
cover
this
case
because
your
client
was
not
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
but
rather
in
her
private
capacity.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
perfectly
okay,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
problems
have
no
answers.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
prove
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
congress
could
--
could
set
up
a
private
organization
to
expend
federal
funds
--
we
are
going
to
abolish
the
department
of
education.
and
we
are
going
to
give
its
function
to
a
private
organization
that
will
take
care
of
all
those
things.
no
good,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
--
on
behalf
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
behalf
of
the
executive.
you
are
looking
for
a
section
of
the
constitution;
i
suggest
article
ii,
section
1,
the
executive
power
shall
be
vested
in
the
president.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
just
as
the
executive
power
includes
the
power
to
expend
funds
appropriated
by
congress,
so
also
the
executive
power
except
in
the
--
in
the
instance
of
necessity
acknowledged
by
young,
which
i
think
was
wrongly
decided
anyway
--
except
in
that
one
narrow
instance,
the
--
the
power
to
prosecute
belongs
to
the
executive.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
private
prosecutions
were
common
at
the
time
of
the
framing?
you
have
got
to
go
back
a
long
way
before
they
were
common.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
plea
bargain
with
a
--
with
an
interested
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
situation
here
in
d.c.?
when
the
woman
comes
in,
can
the
judge
look
it
over
and
say,
ah,
you
don't
have
anything
here;
i'm
not
going
to
--
i'm
not
going
to
allow
you
to
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
understand
--
how
does
the
statute
read?
as
i
understand
it,
it's
not
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
whether
there
is
enough
there
to
allow
her
to
go
forward
or
to
appoint
somebody
on
his
own.
she
is
the
prosecutor.
it's
up
to
her
whether
there
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
hearing
on
whether
she
can
prosecute
or
a
hearing
on
--
on
whether
he's
going
to
be
guilty
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
pay
$1,000
to
your
victim,
which
is
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
courts
don't
have
the
power
to
incarcerate
people.
i
mean,
if
you
are
prosecuting
for
a
criminal
offense,
you
are
exercising
more
than
the
power
of
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
nobody
asserted
in
young
that
the
prosecutor
appointed
by
the
court
was
only
exercising
the
power
of
the
court.
surely
it
was
the
power
of
the
government
that
the
--
that
the
prosecutor
was
exercising.
now,
the
court
was
given
the
power
to
appoint
that
prosecutor,
but
i
would
think
it's
extraordinary
to
say
that
there's
nothing
but
the
court's
power
in
play.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
doesn't
an
agreement
by
the
united
states
not
to
prosecute
carry
the
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
have
to
agree
with
you
that
to
accept
this
argument
that
the
prosecutor
here
is
an
agent
just
of
the
court,
just
of
the
d.c.
court,
not
an
agent
of
the
executive?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
making
the
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
courts
have
ever
asserted
that
they
themselves
have
the
power
to
prosecute.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
on
behalf
of
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
government,
and
that's
why
young
said
you
should
offer
it
first
to
the
united
states
attorney,
and
only
if
he
won't
bring
it,
then
you
can
appoint
somebody
else
to
bring
it.
but
the
--
the
prosecutor
is
not
the
court.
my
god.
what
a
terrible
situation.
the
prosecutor's
the
court,
the
judge
is
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
the
case
that
only
the
u.s.
attorney
can
prosecute
for
this
crime?
could
the
d.c.
attorney
general
or
whatever
the
name
of
it,
what,
counsel,
prosecute
for
this
felony?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it's
all
up
to
the
court;
the
court's
the
big
prosecutor,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
did
raise,
undoubtedly
you
say,
the
point
that
the
only
way
in
which
she
could
be
the
prosecutor
was
as
an
agent
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
her
to
--
to
represent
herself.
