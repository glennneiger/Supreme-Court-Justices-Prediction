justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
criminal
cases,
because
i
--
i
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but
my
--
my
recollection
is
that
orders
to
show
cause
for
contempt
in
the
civil
--
on
the
civil
side
occur
frequently,
and
that
allows
a
jail
sentence
in
california
i
think
of
5
days
--
and
this
is
civil,
because
it's
coercive.
now,
you
are
talking
about
something
different,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
--
have
we
had
cases
that
said
that
federal
separation
of
powers
principles
are
binding
on
territorial
governments,
for
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
your
position
and
can
you
advise
us
--
i
know
it's
not
in
your
case
--
if
there
is
a
plea
bargain
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
does
it
--
does
bind,
do
you
think,
the
prosecutor
in
the
eastern
district?
what
is
your
view
of
that
proposition?
i
know
it's
not
part
of
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can
we
get
to
the
brady?
that
was
one
of
the
questions
i
had,
too.
let's
say
we
have
the
--
we'll
call
it
a
private
person
as
prosecuting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
person
have
a
--
a
right
to
look
at
all
the
government
files
to
see
if
there
is
any
exonerating
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
how
does
it
work?
that's
what
we
want
to
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
does
it
work?
does
--
does
the
--
does
the
person
who
is
bringing
this
prosecution
have
the
right
to
go
in
and
--
and
look
at
the
--
all
--
all
of
the
files
that
the
police
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that
the
prosecutor
has?
that's
the
only
way
brady
would
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
criminal
--
criminal
contempt
prosecution
or
civil
contempt
prosecution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
can
be
order
to
show
cause,
but
you
are
saying
that
every
state
allows
a
private
person
to
have
a
criminal
prosecution
for
criminal
contempt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a
--
a
motion
is
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
the
courts
decide
--
then
the
court
decides
based
on
the
position
of
the
defendant,
of
the
person
who
is
charged
with
contempt--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--whether
or
not
to
proceed.
and
the
court
certainly
can
appoint
a
prosecutor,
and
does
in
many
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
there
were
a
finding
of
innocent,
or
not
guilty,
by
this
prosecutor,
could
the
official
prosecutor
then
prosecute
again,
or
would
there
be
double
jeopardy?
if
you
are
saying
they
are
somehow
separate,
does
the
double
jeopardy
clause
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
was
the
same
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
don't
think
this
is
a
bartkiss-like
case,
like
bartkiss
v.
illinois?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
a
state
prosecution
doesn't
bar
a
later
federal
prosecution.
