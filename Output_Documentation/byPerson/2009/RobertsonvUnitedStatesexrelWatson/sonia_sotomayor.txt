justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
we
have
plenty
of
plea
agreements
jurisprudence
that
say
if
the
southern
district
of
new
york
prosecutes
someone
and
they
sign
a
plea
agreement
and
say,
we're
not
going
to
prosecute
you
for
further
crimes,
we
read
that
to
mean
that
the
southern
district
of
new
york
won't
prosecute
you
for
further
crimes.
we
don't
read
it
that
no
other
government
agency
is
bound,
who
has
jurisdiction
over
that
criminal
activity,
that
they
are
equally
bound.
so
why
isn't
this
case
the
same?
assuming
--
that
you're
making
a
broad
statement,
that
this
has
to
be
brought
in
the
name
of
the
government.
assuming
that's
correct,
does
that
mean
that
--
why
does
that
mean
that
both
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
and
the
attorney
general's
office,
which
appear
to
be
two
different
entities
enforcing
two
different
sets
of
law,
why
would
both
be
bound?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
just
to
say
the
lower
court
was
wrong--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--on
that
premise.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
have
another
option,
once
we
say
they
were
wrong
on
that
premise,
to
send
it
back
and
let
them
look
at
the
second
question,
which
is
whether
or
not
a
private
party
can
bring
an
action
in
the
name
of
the
sovereign.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
point.
yes,
the
caption
doesn't
have
to
be
styled
in
a
particular
name--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
the
prosecuting
person--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
person
whose
name
is
listed
is
acting
for
someone.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
define
what
you
see
as
that
issue?
what's
the
issue
that
you
think--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry,
repeat
it
for
me.
i
sort
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--on
whose
behalf?
that's
the
issue
that
i'm
trying
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--okay.
are
you
saying
that
it's
out
of
the
case
that
if
we
say
it's
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
they
are
not
challenging
that
they
can
do
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
so
--
so
if
we
say
they
can
act
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
your
client
has
to
provide
the
--
her
husband
a
lawyer?
who
has
to
provide
a
lawyer
in
this
criminal
contempt
proceeding?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
if
you
have
answered
the
chief's
question.
he
has
asked
to
have
a
lawyer;
is
there
a
brady
obligation?
what
are
the
constitutional
entitlements--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
not
sure
why
--
how
we
can
avoid
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
this
case
properly
presents
the
argument
that
a
private
party
can't
bring
a
criminal
prosecution
on
their
--
in
their
own
--
perhaps
their
own
name,
they
can,
but
on
their
own,
in
their
own
interest.
it
always
has
to
be
a
government
interest.
that's
what
the
argument
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
saying
the
answer
to
that
is,
no,
they
can
bring
a
claim
in
their
own
name?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
but
the
last
question
is
the
one
that
they
are
disputing;
it
can't
be
in
their
own
interest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you
are
saying
it
can.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
answer
why.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
a
specific
country
--
this
is
the
point
justice
scalia
was
making
--
the
rest
of
the
country,
it's
a
state
system.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
--
and
there--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
but
that's
--
that's
the
question.
that's
the
question
that
i
don't
know
that
we
have
enough
information
in
the
record
about.
is
this
really
--
is
this
prosecution
like
a
state?
that's
the
solicitor
general's
position,
which
is,
it's
on
behalf
of
the
local
government,
not
on
the
behalf
of
the
federal
government
as
a
sovereign.
i
think
that's
what
this
case
speaks
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
whose
state
power
was
she
acting
on
behalf
of?
