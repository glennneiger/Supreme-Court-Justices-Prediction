ms.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
questions,
properly
raised,
in
this
case.
petitioner
is
right
about
one.
respondent
is
right
about
the
other
and
the
disposition.
there
are
a
couple
of
questions
that
are
extremely
interesting
--
i
can
see
why
the
court
is
interested
in
them
--
but
were
not
properly
raised
in
this
case,
and
this
court
should
not
decide
them.
what
petitioner
is
right
about
is
that
in
this
criminal
contempt
action,
ms.
watson,
the
respondent,
was
and
must
have
been
exercising
sovereign
power,
that
she
was
acting
as
a
state
actor
for
purposes
of
the
constitution.
what
respondent
is
right
about--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
way
we
understand
this,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
respondent
was
exercising
sovereign
power
on
behalf
of
the
article
i
court,
the
d.c.
court,
which
of
course
is
partly
a
local
court,
but
is
exercising
power
whose
initial
source,
original
source,
is
congress.
so
she
is
exercising
sovereign
power
in
order
to
vindicate
the
court's
order,
the
order
of
--
of
restraint.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
case,
justice
scalia.
imagine
respondent
essentially
doing
the
same
function
that
an
appointed
person
would
do
in
young.
there,
of
course,
the
court
appointed
the
person
to
prosecute
contempt.
here
respondent
is
essentially
doing
the
same
thing,
is
acting
in
order
to
prosecute
a
contempt
on
the
court
and
to
vindicate
the--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
the
court
is
surely
part
of
the
government,
and
in
the
end
this
is
power
of
the
united
states.
the
court
is
created
through
power
of
the
united
states.
it's
an
article
i
court.
and
so
respondent
is
no
doubt
exercising
sovereign
power
and
exercising
it
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
ultimately.
ms.
elena
kagan
yes,
so
this
goes
to
the
second
question,
in
which
i
think
respondent
is
right.
and
the
reason
is
that
when
a
single
u.s.
attorney's
office
says
that
the
government
will
decide
to
drop
a
certain
set
of
charges,
that
u.s.
attorney's
office
we
believe
is
--
is
speaking
for
itself,
unless
there
is
some
indication
that
it
is
speaking
more
widely
in
such
a
way
that
will
bind
other
parts
of
the
government.
ms.
elena
kagan
the
united
states
government
is
a
complicated
place
and
the
fact
that--
ms.
elena
kagan
--and
the
fact
that
the
southern
district
of
new
york
agrees
to
do
one
thing
does
not
bind,
for
example,
the
ins,
does
not
bind
the--
ms.
elena
kagan
--assuming
that
the
u.s.
attorney
in
the
second
office
has
jurisdiction
and
assuming
that
the
plea
agreement
does
not
say
anything
to
suggest
that
it
should
be
read
more
broadly,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
even
if
you
are
right
i
think
that
we
prevail.
there
are
two
views
in
the
court
system.
one
is
the
second
and
seventh
circuit
and
they
take
the
position
that
i've
taken,
which
is
that
the
default
position
is
that
the
contracting
party
binds
only
the
contracting
party
and
that
the
plea
agreement
needs
to
say
something
in
order
to
apply
more
broadly.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
the
u.s.
attorney
in
new
york
could
--
presumably
that
u.s.
attorney
will
know
who
else
might
have
jurisdiction
over
the
underlying
conduct
and
would
go
and
get
an
agreement
from
those
other
u.s.
attorneys.
but
unless
the
u.s.
attorney
does
that,
under
one
approach
the
agreement
bars
only
the
contracting
entity.
but
even
if
you're
right--
ms.
elena
kagan
--we
actually
don't
think
that
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
we
think
that
in
fact
the
u.s.
attorney
did
not
bind
the
respondent,
but
we
don't
think
it
could
have
bound
the
respondent,
and
it
goes
back
to
my
answer
to
justice
sotomayor,
because
respondent
here
is
representing
the
d.c.
court
system.
and
so
the
u.s.
attorney
really
would
have
had--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes.
ultimately
the
d.c.
court
system
is
an
actor
that
is
wielding
united
states
authority.
but
it's
a
very
different--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
only
the
d.c.
court
could
have
prevented
respondent
from
going
forward.
i
think
that
the
u.s.--
ms.
elena
kagan
--if
--
who
would
you
like
the
person
be
an
agent
of,
justice
scalia?
[laughter]
ms.
elena
kagan
i
apologize.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
i
do
think
that
that's
the
situation
that
we
find
in
young,
where
a
court
appoints
a
person
to
prosecute
a
contempt
on
behalf
of
the
court.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
i
do
think
young
is
different,
justice
scalia,
because
young
was
a
separation
of
powers
case.
this
case
is
not
because
it
arises
in
d.c.
in
young,
absolutely
the
judge
has
to
go
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
first.
but
that's
not
the
case
here,
because
normal
separation
of
powers
principles
are
not
in
application
in
d.c.--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
that
is
entirely
clear.
i
think
that
the
court
could
ask
the
d.c.
attorney
general
to
prosecute
the
crime
in
the
same
way
that
the
court
in
young
asked
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
just
as
--
i
know
you
dissented
in
young,
justice
scalia.
but
just
as
the
court
in
young
goes
to
the
u.s.
attorney
first
and
when
the
court
is
told
no
the
court
can
appoint
its
own
independent
prosecutor,
essentially
that's
what
is
happening
here.
the
court
is
appointing--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
this
court
held
in
dixon
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
apply,
because
they're
all
exercising
power--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes,
and
they
all
are
exercising
power
from
the
united
states.
dixon
involved
this
very
statute.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
case,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
do
think
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes,
that's
exactly
right,
because
ultimately
all
of
these
power
are
exercising
power
that
comes
from
the
same
source,
which
is
the
united
states
government.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
under
several--
ms.
elena
kagan
--under
several
circuits'
law--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
have
a
principal
position
and
i
have
a
back-up
position.
my
principal
position
is
yes,
it
does,
for
the
reason
that
i
gave
to
the
chief
justice.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
skepticism--
ms.
elena
kagan
--it
does.
the
full
rule
is
that
the
bar
is
only
as
to
the
office
that
--
that
executes
the
agreement.
ms.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
not
thought
about
that
question.
i
am
completely
clear
as
to
your
--
the
question
that
you
asked
to
mr.
long,
which
is
does
she
have
brady
obligations.
she
does
have
brady
obligations.
she
was
held
to
brady
obligations.
ms.
elena
kagan
she
--
it
is
absolutely
right
that
she
is
a
state
actor
for
constitutional
purposes.
and
she
was
treated
as
such
throughout
this
litigation.
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
point
--
may
i?
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
breyer's
question,
the
chief
justice's
question:
even
circuits
that
apply
a
default
rule
whereby
the
government
is
the
entire
government
and
there
needs
to
be
limiting
things
in
the
agreement,
i
think
if
you
look
at
this
agreement
you
will
find
those
limiting
things,
both
in
the
cross-outs
in
the
caption
and
in
the
particular
promises
that
the
united
states
government
has
made,
which
applies
really
only
to
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
