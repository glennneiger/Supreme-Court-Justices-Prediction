justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that
even
relevant?
why
do
you
even
get
to
that?
isn't
the
question
what
the
parties
understood
the
plea
agreement
to
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but,
well
--
well,
with
respect,
even
if
the
constitution
permits
this,
if
the
parties
understood
the
plea
agreement
to
mean
that
this
was
going
to
be
barred,
then
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
matter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
i
suppose
the
argument
could
be
that
the
--
that
the
government
has
no
authority
under
d.c.
law
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement,
as
well
require
these
two--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this:
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
said
we
are
satisfied
that
no
objectively
reasonable
person
could
understand
that
mr.
robertson's
plea
agreement
bound
ms.
watson
and
precluded
her
contempt
proceeding
against
mr.
robertson.
if
we
accept
that,
is
there
any
other
issue
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
did
you
preserve
that?
if
--
if
mr.
--
mr.
robertson
had
said,
i
understand
this
only
means
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
charged
with
a
--
a
criminal
offense
by
the
united
states
attorney's
office
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
it
has
no
application
to
this
civil
contempt
proceeding.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
a
separate
question.
so
the
first
question
is:
what
was
agreed
to
under
the
plea
agreement,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
just
so
i
understand
what
is
before
us,
you
preserve
--
you
saying
--
you
are
saying
you
preserve
the
issue
that
even
if
your
client
fully
understood
that
this
plea
agreement
had
no
application
to
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding,
he
preserved
the
argument
that
he
could
contest
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
there's
the
contract
issue.
but
did
you
--
in
the
lower
court,
did
you
argue
even
if
he
gave
that
up,
under
the
plea
agreement,
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
still
could
not
be
brought?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
if
he
didn't
get
that
--
a
bar
to
that
under
the
plea
agreement,
the
contempt
proceeding
would
still
be
barred
for
some
other
reason?
did
you
make
that
argument?
