justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
if,
in
fact
--
you
agree
or
don't
agree,
i
don't
know
--
but
the
government
says
and
they
say,
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
here
--
and
it
can,
under
the
constitution,
delegate
to
a
private
person
the
authority
to
prosecute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
big
argument
against
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
argument
is:
this
would
be
the
one
person
you
can't
delegate
it
to
because
they
are
very
biased.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
argument,
you
say,
is
not
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
now
we
have
what
is
in
the
case,
which
is
the
question
of
whether,
leaving
that
argument
out
of
it,
did
they
hear
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
highly
relevant,
i
think,
because
i
think
you
would
you
like
to
make
the
argument,
which
i
would
like
to
hear,
is
that:
forget
the
united
states.
the
constitution
permits
this
woman
to
bring
the
case
as
a
private
citizen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
you
are
right
about
that,
the
plea
agreement
drops
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
nobody
says
made
a
plea
agreement
with
her.
because
that
is
the
argument
you
want
to
make
at
some
point.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
do
about
that?
because
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
focus
on
the
case
--
the
issue
you
want
me
to
decide--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--without
thinking
about
the
one
you
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reasons,
as
i
have
categorized
this
--
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
what
do
--
so
what
do
we
do?
i
mean,
i
think
of
this
as
like
aeschylus;
you
have
the
furies
gradually
giving
way
to
justice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
private--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--vengeance
is
out
and
justice
is
in,
and
we
have
3,000
years
of
that,
and
they
are
all
going
to
be
variations
of
that
theme
and
we
could
think
of
100
arguments.
boasting.
then
is
this
special?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
before
i
can
answer
that
question,
i
would
like
to
know
whether
the
government
could
appoint
the
private
person.
after
all
there
is
a
check
--
there
is
a
check
against
the
total
furies,
it's
the
government
doing
it.
now
you
say
no,
the
government
can't
do
it,
so
--
but
they
can
do
it
on
their
own.
maybe
--
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
get
my
--
how
do
i
begin
to
answer
these
questions
bound
together
in
my
mind
in
some
partial
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
want
to
do
that.
you
see,
so
there
is
no
control.
you
are
saying
we
want
the
private
individuals
to
have
the
authority
to
bring
criminal
contempt;
they
are
on
their
own;
they
decide
it.
the
government
has
nothing
to
say
about
this.
it's
a
totally
private
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
the
state
of
california,
trying
to
save
money,
say
we
have
a
very
good
idea.
we
are
going
to
pass
one
law,
abolish
all
the
prosecutors'
offices
and
say
wherever
there
is
a
victim
of
crime,
that
victim
will
bring
the
prosecution.
now
you
really
are
back
to
the
furies.
is
that
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
there
was,
before
--
before
aeschylus.
or
whatever.
but
the--
[laughter]
you
would
say
that
that
is
constitutional--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
have
a
statute
that
all
criminal
prosecutions
would
be
brought
by
victims,
period?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
there
are,
then
why
aren't
there
the
same
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
might
--
you
might
--
you
might
say
this.
to
answer
your
question
that
is
here,
there
are
a
couple
of
ways
of
doing
this.
one
way
you
would
say
is,
well,
don't
worry
about
this
so
much.
if
the
answer
is
no,
you
can
still
bring
your
private
prosecution
but
you
have
got
to
get
government
permission,
because
you
are
doing
it
in
the
way
of
the
government.
but
if
the
answer
to
the
question
is
if
you
can't
do
either,
they
you
might
say,
then
why
wouldn't
you
say
why
well,
aren't
we
back
to
the
eumenides,
and
the
answer
is
going
to
be
this
is
say
contempt.
contempt
is
special.
i
don't
know
whether
either
or
both
of
those
ways
would
work.
so
what
would
you
think,
since
the
government
has
changed
its
position,
of
sending
this
back
so
some
of
these
things
can
be
worked
out?
at
least
we
would
have
some
opinions
that
would
help
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
that's
a
different
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
--
that's
--
why
isn't
it
a
different
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
now
you
are
into
the
question
of
what
counts
as
a
prosecution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
again,
i
am
at
sea.
i
don't
know
what
the
authority
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
accept
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
somewhere
i
can
look
to
see
what
happens?
all
i
can
find
in
the
long
law
is
that
a
violation
of
the
order
is
a
contempt.
fine;
no
problem.
and
then
the
only
word
about
the
petitioner,
it
says
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
relief
under
this
chapter,
which
contains
about
50
different
things.
and
it
doesn't
say
what
kind
of
relief.
it
doesn't
say
how
you
get
relief.
it
doesn't
say
if
you
are
just
asking
--
all
those
things
you
raised.
so
how
do
i
find
out
actually
what
is
in
the
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
the
earlier
part
of
this
statute
which
goes
on
for
six
pages
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
statue,
which
goes
on
for
six
pages,
seven
pages.
it
says,
a
petitioner
has
a
right
to
seek
relief
under
this
subchapter.
now,
that
contains
civil
contempt.
it
contains
how
you
get
protective
orders.
it
contains
a
lot
of
things
that
are
absolutely
noncontroversial.
so
i
am
trying
to
figure
out:
what
is
the
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
your
argument
the
broad
argument
that
the
chief
justice
was
talking
about,
that
we
have
a
man
who
drives
in
a
car
from
baltimore
to
rob
a
bank
in
washington
and
the
u.s.
attorney
in
washington
gives
him
a
piece
of
paper
which
says,
i
will
not
prosecute
you
for
this
now
or
in
the
future,
and
suddenly
the
u.s.
attorney
in
baltimore
prosecutes
it.
are
you
saying
that
that
is
barred
or
not
barred?
that's
the
broad
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
are
you
making
a
narrow
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
just
asking
you
your
position
on
that.
can
the
--
does
this
piece
of
paper
from
the
u.s.
attorney
in
washington
bar
prosecution
by
the
u.s.
attorney
in
baltimore?
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
bar?
