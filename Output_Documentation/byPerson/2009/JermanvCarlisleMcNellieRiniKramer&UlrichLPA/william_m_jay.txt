mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
pick
up
with
a
point
that
mr.
russell
made,
which
is
that
the
fdcpa
is
of
a
piece
with
most
civil
regulatory
statutes,
in
that
it
makes
knowledge
of
the
law
an
aggravating
factor
and
subjects
violators
who
know
that
they
are
violating
a
law
subject
to
substantial
civil
penalties
of
up
to
$16,000
per
day.
but
it
doesn't
completely
excuse
violations
based
on
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
law.
in
order
to
be
excused,
the
violation
must
have
resulted
from
a
bona
fide
error
and
meet
all
three
elements
of
the
bona
fide
error
defense.
we
think
that
two
of
those
elements
are
not
satisfied
by
the
respondents'
error
in
this
case.
first,
legal
errors,
for
the
reason
mr.
russell
explained,
aren't
unintentional.
justice
scalia
asked
about
whether
the
phrase
"the
violation
is
not
intentional"
is
a
signal
in
that
respect.
we
think
that
the
work
that
that
phrase,
"the
violation
was
not
intentional",
does
in
this
circumstance
is
to
show
that
the
portion
of
the
debt
collector's
conduct
that
triggers
the
violation
of
the
statute,
it
was
--
is
what
must
be
unintentional.
let
me
illustrate
that
with
an
example.
under
the
statute,
a
debt
collector
who
places
a
call
to
a
debtor
at
home
after
9:00
at
night
may
well
violate
the
statute;
likely
does
violate
the
statute.
so
what
must
be
unintentional
for
that
debt
collector
to
make
out
the
bona
fide
error
defense
is
not
that
the
telephone
call
had
been
--
had
been
placed
unintentionally,
but
rather
that
the
debt
collector
didn't
have
knowledge,
for
example,
because
of
an
error
about
what
time
zone
the
debtor
lives
in.
the
--
the
debt
collector
didn't
know
that
the
call
was
being
placed
after
9:00
at
night.
that
is
an
unintentional
error,
and
it
is
excused
under
the
statute
if
the
debt
collector
can
also
show
that
it
maintains
procedures
reasonably
adapted
to
prevent
any
such
errors--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
if
--
if
you
check,
but
due
to
a
keyboarding
error,
for
example,
arizona
is
entered
as
alabama
or
an
error
in
time
zone
is
entered
in
whatever
record
is
being
consulting
by
the
debt
collector,
that's
the
kind
of
factual
error,
a
clerical,
bookkeeping
type
error
that
--
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
created
this
defense.
and
it
bears
repeating
that
congress
has
created
this
--
this
defense
in
identical
terms
in
a
number
of
other
statutes;
federal
agencies
have
construed
the
identical
language
in
a
number
of
other
statutes.
and
never
has
congress
or
a
federal
agency
contemplated
that
one
of
these
defenses
would,
in
fact,
encompass
legal
errors.
mr.
william
m.
jay
we
don't
have
a
specific
indication,
justice
ginsburg,
why
it
didn't
go
back
and
revise
every
other
statute
that
--
that
already
had
such
a
defense.
but
i
think
that
the
answer
is
simply
that
congress
was
revising
the
truth
in
lending
act
in
a
statute
called
the
truth
in
lending
simplification
act,
and
the
--
the
statute
in
which
that
was
passed
didn't
make
any
other
--
any
other
changes
to
non-financial
statutes.
it
didn't
reopen
the
federal
--
fair
debt
collection
practice
act
in
any
other
way.
in
fact,
the
relevant
portion
of
the
fdcpa,
section
1692k,
hasn't
been
amended
in
any
way
since
congress
first
enacted
it
in
1977.
so
we
think
that
the
relevance
of
the
1980
amendment
to
tila
is
simply
this:
it's
part
of
a
consistent
pattern
by
congress
and
by
the
agencies
such
as
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
and
the
federal
reserve
board
that
interpret
statutes
with
identical
or
very
similar
bona
fide
error
provisions
to
say:
errors
of
law
are
not
what
congress
or
the
agency
had
in
mind.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
i
think,
justice
alito,
that
that
is
not
uncommon
under
any
civil
statute,
that
when
a
court
of
appeals
has
precedent
on
point,
that
there
is
always
a
possibility
that
that
precedent
will
be
reversed.
now,
of
course,
this
statute
has
a
very
short
statute
of
limitations.
it's
one
year.
and
if
there's
some
possibility
that
the
law
will
change
down
the
road,
that
short
statute
of
limitations
will
prevent
most
violations
from
being
reconsidered
down
the
road
after
the
--
after
the
law
is
clarified--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
you
are
saying
that
the
statute
of
limitations
makes
it
difficult?
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
correct.
mr.
william
m.
jay
if
you
ask
and
they
answer
and
they
say
that
your
view
of
the
statute
is
the
correct
one--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--in
the
past
decade,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
have
been
asked
seven
times
for
opinions
by
the
debt
collection
industry,
and
they
have
answered
four
of
them
under
the
criteria
that
they
adopted
in
the
regulations
they
are
cited
in
footnote
of
our
brief.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
the
debt
collection
industry
seems
to
not
have
asked
very
many
times,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
first,
even
if
this
were
relevant
to
what
congress
intended
the
--
how
congress
intended
the
adviser
opinion
process
to
work
when
it
wrote
this
provision
in
1977,
that
the
debt
collection
industry,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
--
if
you
ask
the
ftc
for
an
adviser
opinion,
and
it
sides
against
the
requester,
which,
incidentally,
in
none
of
these
four
opinions
has
it
ever
done
--
in
each
case
it
sided
with
the
requester
--
but
if
it
sides
against,
then
the
requester
is
on
notice
of
the
law.
and
the
requester
is
going
to
be
--
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
the
requester
is
going
to
be
in
the
category
of
--
for
heightened
penalties,
because
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
suggest
that
you
don't
know
the
law--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
i'm
saying,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
--
that
they
would
understandably
prefer
to
ask
their
own
lawyer
for
an
opinion
if
the
--
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
the
respondent's
position
and
affirm
the
sixth
circuit.
they
would
be
able
to
ask
their
own
lawyer,
get
a
private
opinion,
and
if
the
opinion
is
favorable,
then
they
are
home
free
under
the
bona
fide
error
defense.
if
--
if
it's
an
--
if
it's
adverse
advice,
they
may
need
--
even
if
they
disregard
the
advice,
they
may
never
need
to
disclose
the
opinion
at
all,
whereas
the
ftc
advisory
opinion
process
clarifies
the
law
for
the
benefit
of
the
entire
field.
those
opinions
are
public.
they
are
published
and--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit
that
you
can't
look
simply
at
the
number
of
responses
without
looking
at
the
number
of
inquiries.
and
i
am
confident
that
if
this
court,
as
we
urge
that
it
do,
reverses
the
sixth
circuit
and
makes
clear
that
asking
your
own
lawyer
for
an
opinion
is
not
going
to
be
a
safe
harbor
defense
under
subsection
c,
that
there
will
be
increased
use
of
the
--
of
the
safe
harbor
defense
that
congress
actually
wrote
into
the
statute
in
subsection
e.
mr.
william
m.
jay
in
the
four
that
were
granted,
three
of
them
took
three
to
four
months.
the
fourth
is
an
exception,
and
that
--
that's
the
one
cited
in
the
retail
collection
attorneys'
amicus
brief.
that
is
an
exception
because
the
request
was
originally
submitted
as
a
comment
in
a
pending
rulemaking
conducted
by
the
ftc
and
a
number
of
other
agencies.
the
ftc
agreed
to
take
that
comment
in
the
rulemaking
and
act
on
it
an
advisory
opinion
under
the
fdcpa
so
that
it
wouldn't
have
to
wait
for
the
other
agencies
to
agree
with
its
view,
and
so
that
one
took
considerably
longer.
but
the
average
processing
time
is
three
to
four
months.
and
of
course
the
ftc
makes
a
number
of
other
informal
guidance
avenues
available,
if
what
the
debt
collector
wants
is
simply
a
quick
answer
and
not
a
formal
safe
harbor
with
the
imprimatur
of
the
commission.
one
can
--
the
commission
staff
has
published
guidance,
and
indeed,
the
commission
staff
is
available
over
the
telephone--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--if
that's
wrong,
it
doesn't
confer
the
safe
harbor.
but
that's
up
to
the
debt
collector,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
you
--
if
you
want
an
informal
opinion,
you
can
get
one
very
quickly.
if
you
want
the
safe
harbor,
that
requires
the
imprimatur
of
the
commissioners,
and
that
takes
a
bit
longer.
we
don't
think
that's
at
all
inconsistent
with
what
congress
intended,
and
we
do
think
that
congress
intended
that
this
be
the
primary
avenue.
and
if
you
look
at
the
advisory
opinion
provision
of
the
truth
in
lending
act,
we
think
that
illustrates
it.
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
fdcpa,
the
truth
in
lending
act
advisory
opinion
provision
had
only
been
on
the
books
for
a
couple
of
years,
but
it
had
already
filled
more
than
100
pages
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
with
advisory
opinions.
and
we
think
that
that's
how
congress
intended
for
the
law
under
this
statute
to
be
clarified
as
well,
not
in
a
way
that
effectively
confers
qualified
immunity
on
debt
collectors
whenever
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
law.
we
think
that
that
is
reinforced
as
well
by
a
substantive
aspect
of
the
statute,
which
is
that
congress
recognized
--
and
this
is
in
particular
in
the
legislative
history
at
page
18
in
footnote
9
of
our
brief
--
that
the
debt
collection
industry
is
extremely
aggressive
and
looks
for
loopholes
whenever
they
exist.
so
the
substantive
prohibitions
of
the
statute,
especially
1692d,
e,
and
f,
are
written
in
such
a
way
that
they
contain
broad,
substantive
prohibitions
that
are
illustrated
by
examples,
but
those
examples
expressly
are
illustrative
and
not
exclusive.
congress
would
not
have
wanted
a
debt
collector
to
be
able
to
say:
well,
gee,
this
--
this
practice
is
not
expressly
addressed
by
the
statute
and
has
not
yet
expressly
been
addressed
by
any
judicial
opinion,
and
to
say:
well,
that
law
is
not
clearly
established.
we
think
it's
--
may
i
finish
the
sentence
mr.
chief
justice?
we
think,
instead,
that
congress
would
have
recognized
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
protect
the
unsophisticated
debtor,
and
that
the
sophisticated
repeat
players
of
the
debt
collection
industry,
if
they
want
to
clarify
the
law,
should
go
to
the
ftc.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
