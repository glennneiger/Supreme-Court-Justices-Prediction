justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
answer
one
question
--
i'm
just
a
little
confused
about.
one
statute
has
the
defense
in
expressly.
the
other
doesn't.
is
there
a
difference
in
the
likelihood
of
unfairness
under
the
two
statutes?
why
--
is
there
a
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
provide
a
mistake
of
law
defense
under
tila
and
not
in
this
--
this
--
in
this
case?
why
would
it
treat
them
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question
is
--
is
there
a
greater
need
for
the
mistake
of
law
defense
under
one
statute,
rather
than
the
other,
i
sort
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--have
the
same
problem
justice
scalia
expressed.
