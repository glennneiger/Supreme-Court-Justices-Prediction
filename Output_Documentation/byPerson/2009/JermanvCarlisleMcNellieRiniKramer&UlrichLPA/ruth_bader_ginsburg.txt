justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
example
of
that
couldn't
happen,
because
if
you
were
calling
debtors,
you
should
certainly
check
what
time
of
evening
the
call
is.
so
you
get
over
the
first
problem,
but
then
on
the
second
problem,
the
second
--
how
could
that
possibly
be
careful
procedure,
if
you
don't
even
check
to
see
what
time
zone
the
person
is
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
why
when
congress
codified
that
law
errors
don't
count,
codified
that
for
the
truth
in
lending
act
purposes,
it
didn't
make
the
corresponding
change
in
the
others?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
also
makes
it
hard
to
use
the
safe
harbor
to
get
the
--
to
get
advice
from
the
ftc.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
--
that
if
you
have
--
you
can
--
you
are
home
free
if
you
ask
the
ftc,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
only
--
only
way
you
--
under
your
reading
that
you
are
home
free?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
what
the
time
interval
was?
you
said
there
were
seven
requests
for
affirmative
responses.
how
long
did
it
take
from
when
the
request
was
made
until
the
ftc
responded?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
also
saying
--
and
then
this
sentence
is
what
i
would
like
to
have
your
response
on,
that
there
is
no
statute
--
federal
statute
that
makes
mistake
of
law
a
defense.
so
this
would
be
highly
extraordinary,
and
if
that's
what
congress
meant
to
do,
to
make
something
that
ordinarily
is
no
defense
a
defense,
we
would
expect
congress
to
do
so
expressly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
we
do
that
in
the
context
of
this
case?
because
we
are
talking
on
a
highly
abstract
level.
this
is
a
statute
that
required
a
validation
notice,
and
for
the
most
part
the
validation
notice
that
was
sent
to
the
debtor
is
exactly
the
words
of
the
statute.
but
the
lawyer
added
two
words
that
are
not
in
this
statute,
"in
writing".
where
did
that
come
from?
we
are
told
this
was
not
the
model
form
that
was
used
by
the
debt
collectors'
association.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
you
"should"--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--rather
than
"may"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
doesn't
that
just
mean
that
congress
wants
to
confirm
that
the
judges
--
the
majority
of
judges
who
--
who
had
held
that
it
didn't
--
that
errors
of
law
were
not
a
defense,
that
they
were
right,
it's
not
changing
--
changing
anything.
it's
just
confirming
that
the
majority
view
is
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
wouldn't
one
say,
now,
congress
has
confirmed
that
the
word
in
the
truth
and
lending
act
means
thus
and
so,
congress
has
said
that's
what
those
words
mean,
and
then
go
back
to
the
other
statutes
and
say
the
same
language
was
used,
so
it
means
the
same
thing,
the
same
thing
that
congress
has
just
confirmed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
mr.
jay
tell
us
there
were
seven
requests?
are
you
disputing
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
isn't
--
this
is
a
class
action,
wasn't
it?
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action?
