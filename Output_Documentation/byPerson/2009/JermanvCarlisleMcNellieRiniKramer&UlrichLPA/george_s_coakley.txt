mr.
george
s.
coakley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
starting
point
for
discerning
congressional
intent
is
the
text
of
the
statute.
the
respondents
submit
that
in
a
review
of
the
text
of
this
statute,
all
of
the
components
may
be
read
plainly
to
include
the
bona
fide
error
defense,
to
include
legal
error,
starting
with
the
words
that
the
court
was
discussing
with
mr.
russell
and
mr.
jay,
"violation
not
intentional",
moving
on
to
"violation
resulting
from
a
bona
fide
error.
"
then
"the
maintenance
of
procedures
reasonably
adapted.
"
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
trial
court
and
--
have
construed
this
statute
in
a
plain-meaning
analysis;
that
is
to
say,
they
start
with
the
plain
meaning
of
each
of
those
words
and
construe
them
in
their
context.
they
did
not
find
an
ambiguity.
they
did
not
find
an
absurdity.
they
found
that
each
of
those
--
each
of
those
components
may
be
squared
with
a
--
with
a
legal
error
analysis.
petitioner
even
concedes
with
respect
to
the
element
of
"violation
not
intentional"
that
our
interpretation
is,
quote,
"not
linguistically
impossible",
end
quote.
what
--
what
petitioner
has
done
is
to
avoid
the
conventional
standards
of
--
of
congressional
--
i
mean,
of
statutory
interpretation,
which
is
the
plain
meaning
from
lamie,
and
moving,
then,
outward
if
necessary.
and
they
have
opted
instead
for
looking
at
unrelated
statutes
such
as
tila,
then
going
to
the
safe
harbor,
and
then
pulling
the
words
"violation"
and
"intentional"
out
of
the
first
prong,
taking
them
out
of
context,
taking
them
out
of
order,
and
then
applying
them
to
this
maxim,
"ignorance
of
the
law".
even--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
their
argument,
that
it
is
unprecedented.
but
their
unprecedented
argument
gets
them
nowhere.
that
is
one
of
the
panoply
of
arguments
that
is
outside
the
plain
meaning
that
they
go
to
to
say
well,
this
is
unprecedented;
congress
couldn't
have
intended
this.
there
are
reports
that
read
the
tila
bona
fide
error
to
mean
legal
error
at
one
point
in
time,
so
it
wasn't
unprecedented
to
the
extent
of
that,
and
what
did
congress
do
with
respect
to
tila?
in
1980,
they
didn't
like
the
interpretation
that
they
were
getting
with
respect
to
legal
error
from
the
tila
error,
which
is
a
totally
different
statute,
and
so
they
reacted
by
amending
tila
to
say
no
legal
error
in
tila.
they
did
not
correspondingly
amend
the
fdcpa,
which
shows
congress's
intent
to
distinguish
the
two
statutes--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--absolutely
not,
justice
sotomayor.
this--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--well
--
it
was
absolutely
meant
to
protect
debt
collectors,
however,
that
term
was
defined
in
1977,
which
included
lay
debt
collectors.
in
1986
it
went
up
a
level
when
we
added
lawyers,
and
the
exemption
went
out
and
in
1995
it
went
up
another
level
when
we
added
litigating
lawyers.
but
most
certainly
it
went
back
to
1977
and
included
lay
debt
collectors,
and
lay
debt
collectors
didn't
get
a
"get
out
of
jail
free"
card
here
by
just
pulling
up
the
bona
fide
error
defense
and
saying
i'm
done.
they
are
subject
to
the
three
rigors
of
the
bona
fide
error
defense.
they
have
to
prove
that
the
violation
was
not
intentional
--
that
the
violation--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--pardon?
mr.
george
s.
coakley
how--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--no,
but--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--the
unfairness
of
this
statute,
as
justice
breyer
indicated
in
his
commentary
with
mr.
russell,
is
--
is
exemplified
by
your
question.
if
a
lay
debt
collector
calls
a
lawyer
in
the
1977
to
1986
round
and
asks
a
lawyer
for
an
interpretation
of
this
act,
and
he
base
--
he
relies
upon
that
and
acts
accordingly,
per
their
interpretation
only
applying
to
clerical
error,
that
lay
debt
collector
who
relied
upon
advice
of
counsel
is
out
of
luck
if
the
decision
goes
against
the
lay
debt
collector,
because
he
or
she
has
no
error
of
law
as
a
defense.
so
it
goes
up,
the
levels
of
unfairness
go
up
as
the
time
goes
on.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
but
in
this,
your
honor,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
bona
fide
error
defense
that
has
been
crafted
into
this
statute.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
that
gives
credence
to
the
1977
focus
when
lawyers
were
not
part
of
the
statute.
certainly
your
example
heightens
the
unfairness
of
it
once
lawyers
come
in
in
1995
through
heintz
as
a
litigating
lawyer.
certainly
a
lawyer
has
--
it
creates
this
irreconcilable
conflict
of
interest
that
you
alluded
to
in
your
discussion
with
mr.
russell.
that
puts
the
lawyer
between
the
proverbial
rock
and
a
hard
place.
he
either
--
he
or
she
either
chooses
to
follow
the
law
and
risk--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--i
believe
that
the
lawyer
would
be
just
subject
to
the
rigors
of
the
bona
fide
error
defense,
the
way
any
other
debt
collector
as
defined
from
1977
forward
would
be--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
this
would
be
part
of
the
inquiry
that
a
lawyer
would
be
faced
in
trying
to
prove
the
affirmative
defense
of
bona
fide
error
in
a
legal
situation,
and
that
--
that
would
be
part
of
the
good
faith
analysis,
part
of
the
reasonable
procedures
that
he
would
present
to
the
court--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--there
was
a
case,
graziano,
your
honor,
that
talked
about
the
--
was
construing
the
statute
and
specifically
section
1692g(a)(3)
and
determining
because
g
--
the
second
and
third
prong
of
the
statute
had
the
words
in
writing,
does
the
first
prong
in
order
to
be
coherently
read
remain
"in
writing"?
graziano
says
yes,
you
should
put
"in
writing
in
order"
to
make
a
coherent--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--"should".
mr.
george
s.
coakley
no.
well
graziano
suggested
"in
writing"
is
the
only
effective
way
to
construe
this
statute;
otherwise,
it
makes
no
sense.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--that's
correct.
and
that
actually
points
out
a
--
the
unfairness
of
this
whole
situation.
because
my
clients,
respondents
tomorrow
could
be
sued
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
by
somebody
for
--
because
they
took
the
words
"in
writing"
out
of
their
validation
notice.
immediately
upon
being
sued
in
this
case,
they
could
be
sued
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
for
not
following
--
or
not
following
graziano,
because
somebody
would
conclude
that
that
was
the
more
effective
way
--
reading
of
that
statute,
and
if
they
are
wrong,
then
the
lawyer
has
no
bona
fide
error--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--justice
scalia,
there
were
cases,
although
not
court
of
appeals
cases
that--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--that's
correct.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
well,
to
the
extent
that
there
were
two
different
--
two
different
analyses
or
interpretations
that
had
emerged
before
1980
that
led
the
congress
to
--
in
1980,
enact
or
to
amend
tila,
otherwise,
as
pointed
out
in
the
herrera
case
in
our
brief,
if
everything
was
so
settled
in
1980,
why
would
there
be
a
need
to
clarify
the
definition
of
bona
fide
error
under
tila,
and
--
and
if
it
was
clarified
in
1980
under
the
fdcpa,
then
why
didn't
they
take
the
step
and
clarify
it
in
the
fdcpa
from
1980
to
2010,
especially
when
congress--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--your
honor,
the
--
the
petitioner's
position
was
that
the
case
law
was
uniform
at
the
time,
and
our
position
is
the
case
law
was
not
uniform
at
the
time.
there
were
cases
that
had
taken
an
opposite
approach
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
--
on
tila,
and
that
is
what
led
to
congress
reacting
in
1980
to
specifically
exclude
legal
error
from
the
tila
defense
and
has
--
congress
has--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
case
law
says
that
the
law
has
to
be
settled,
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it
was
not
settled,
and
the
courts,
afterwards,
have
reflected
that
there
was
no
settlement,
and
that
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
error
portion
of
the
tila
bona
fide
error
was
--
was
clarified,
as
the
petitioner
puts
it,
to
say
this
excludes
any
interpretations
of
legal
--
of
legal
--
of
the
legal
interpretations
of
tila.
and
then
there
was
no
--
whether
you
call
it
a
clarification,
whether
you
call
it
a
ratification,
whether
you
call
it
an
amendment,
it
doesn't
matter,
congress
didn't
then
similarly
amend
the
fdcpa
to
be
consistent
with
their--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
the
--
the
words
tila
statute
were
being
construed,
although
not
by
courts
of
appeals,
to
reasonably
read
the
bona
fide
error
encompasses
legal
error.
there
was
a
change
--
change
--
a
clarification,
whatever,
in
1980,
to
specifically
say,
bona
fide
error
does
not
include
legal
interpretations
of
tila,
and
that
was
then
never
clarified,
ratified,
or
whatever,
nothing
was
done
to
the
fdcpa
at
that
time,
and
--
and
the--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--i--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--well,
under
the
tila,
there
were
--
there
were--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--okay.
but--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--yes--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--well,
in
this
case
that
we
are
here
on,
judge
gaughan
from
the
u.s.
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
ohio
read
the
--
read
that
tila--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--that
was
after
the
amendment.
now,
you're
talking
about
before
1980?
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--under
the
--
well,
the
fdcpa
came
into
effect
in
1977,
and
the
--
tila
was
in
1968.
you
are
asking
between
'68
and
'77?
the
were
--
the
wellmaker
case
did
--
did
construe
the
statute
to
include
legal
error.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
the
statute
doesn't
refer
to
substantively
or
procedurally,
justice
alito,
the
statute
refers
to
bona
fide
error
and
the
maintenance
of
procedures
reasonably
adapted.
as
a
--
as
a
--
as
either
a
lay
debt
collector
or
as
a
lawyer
debt
collector,
they
must
establish
good
faith
in
attempting
to
comply
with
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--well,
in
proving--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--absolutely.
i
mean,
he
would
--
he
would
have
--
that
lawyer
would
have
to
meet
the
three
prongs
of
the
affirmative
defense
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
if
he
doesn't
prove
all
of
the
prongs,
he's
out.
if
he
proves
all
of
the
prongs,
he's
in,
and
if
he
creates
an
issue
of
fact
on
one
of
the
three
prongs,
than
he's
going
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
fact-finding
analysis,
which
turns
out
to
be
the
--
you
know,
this
statute
has
not
proved
to
be
unworkable.
and
if
i
could
follow
up
to
justice
scalia's
and
justice
ginsburg's
query
about
the
--
the
--
and
justice
sotomayor's
--
about
the
interpretation
of
the
words
tila>
["]
versus
fdcpa>
["],
i
think
a
review
of
the
cases
of
the
seventh
and
tenth
circuits
is
instructive
because
the
seventh
circuit
was
one
of
the
circuits
that,
under
tila,
had
--
had
interpreted
the
word
to
mean
clerical
error
only.
the
tenth
circuit
--
and
the
tenth
circuit
as
well.
now,
today,
under
interpreting
the
fdcpa
bona
fide
error,
they
have
abrogated
that
meaning
in
tila
and
have
come
around
to
this
means
legal
error
under
the
fdcpa.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
there
--
there
are
differences
--
substantial
differences,
justice
stevens,
in
the
tila
and
in
the
fdcpa
statute,
starting
with
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
starting
with
the
construction
of
the
statute,
one,
tila
has
a
criminal
liability,
tila
has
life
lines
that
the
debt
collector
doesn't
have
in
the
fdcpa,
tila
dealing
--
is
dealing
with
disclosure
of
financial
information,
tila
has
regulations,
as
opposed
to
no
regulations--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--the
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
it's
a
--
it's
a
distinction
between
why
--
in
trying
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question,
it's
a
distinction
why
tila
would
be
interpreted
differently
by
the
--
than
the
fdcpa.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
given--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--given
--
well,
given
the
purpose
of
tila,
and
tila
dealing
with
computational
errors,
regulation
c,
truth
in
lending,
they
--
they
amend
--
they
amended
tila
--
i
mean,
i'm
sorry.
originally
tila
didn't
have
a
bona
fide
error
and
then
they
amended
it
so
as
to
--
before
it
was
enacted
--
so
as
to
cover
this
area
to
provide
for
the
computational
error.
because
it's
so
fraught
with
mathematical
errors
and
the
like.
that
is
not
the
situation
in
the
fdcpa.
and
that
is
precisely
the
reasoning
that
is
the
seventh
and
tenth
circuit
have
noted,
and
the
case
of
frye
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
has
noted,
as
the
distinction
between
these
two
statutes,
and
why
one
could
be
interpreted
this
way
and
the
fdcpa
could
be
reasonably
interpreted
the
other
way.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
absolutely.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
--
of
tila.
and
certainly
lawyers
are
not
--
lawyers
are
not
creditors
under
tila.
and
--
so
that's
a
distinction
between
the
--
the
two
statutes.
and
further,
the
--
there
is
an
administrative
penalty
under
the
fdcpa
that
--
the
$16,000
a
day,
but
the
bona
fide
error
does
not
apply
to
that.
so
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
the
administrative
penalties
under
the
fdcpa
and
the
civil
penalties
under
the
fdcpa.
and
in
--
and
in
truth,
the
--
the
statutes
are
--
are
significantly
different.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
i
do
not
have
that
empirical
evidence,
your
honor.
i
do
know
that
the
briefs
are
consistent
on
this
point,
and
as
admitted
to
by
the
petitioners,
there
have
been
four
advisory
opinions
from
the
fdcpa
--
from
the
ftc
in
30
years.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
i
don't
know
how
many
have
asked.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
i
think
that--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--i
am
not
disputing
that,
justice
ginsburg.
what
i
am
basically
saying
is
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
the
truth
with
respect
to
the
ftc
and
the
safe
harbor
defense
and
the
fdcpa,
that
mr.
jay
does
not
argue
that
one
is
superfluous
to
the
other;
the
petitioner
argues
that
one
makes
the
other
superfluous
--
neither
are
superfluous
to
the
other--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--but
the
safe
harbor
defense
on
its
face
applies
prospectively.
the
fdcpa
bona
fide
error
defense--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--yes,
but
the
bona
fide
error
defense
applies
retrospectively.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
i--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--and
--
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
penultimate
paragraph
in
there:
for
the
foregoing
reasons
your
request
for
advisory
opinion
does
not
satisfy
either
the
prerequisites
described,
well
--
and
accordingly
we
can't
--
grant
it.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
the
safe
harbor--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--justice
scalia,
as
it
worked
out
the
safe
harbor
is
neither
safe
nor
a
harbor,
but
that's
not
the
perspective
that
we
have
to
look
at
it.
we
have
to
look
at
it
from
1997,
it
was
for
a
prospective
course
of
conduct
that
gives
the
debt
collector
categorical--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--well,
there
are
reasons
why
a
debt
collector
may
use
it
if
he
has
time
and
he
needs
the
prospective
letter
from
the
ftc.
in
--
in
reality
debt
collector's
going
to
go
to
the
bona
fide
error
because
it's
retrospective,
although
there
is
risk
with
the
bona
fide
error,
because
it's
not
the
categorical
immunity
that
the
safe
harbor
gives.
and
there's
--
they're
not
inconsistent.
the
safe
harbor
is
not
a
--
a
statutory
interpretation
why
you
should
drive
a
meaning
into
the
bona
fide
error
provision
that
is
not
apparent
on
its
face.
i
would
say
in
closing
that
justice
breyer,
your
--
your
comments
earlier
are
just
right.
this
is
worse
--
a
reading,
the
safe
harbor,
reading
the
bona
fide
error
provision
to
exclude
legal
error
is
worse
than
unfair.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
justice
ginsburg
asked
the
question
about
unprecedented.
in
--
in
truth,
what
would
really
be
unprecedented
here
would
be
for
this
court
to
construe
the
bona
fide
error
defense
so
that
a
lawyer
or
a
debt
collector
who
is
giving
advice
to
his
client
to
follow
a
particular
way
of
action,
and
the
law
was
unsettled,
for
that
lawyer
to
be
subject
to
--
to
be
punished
for
personal
liability.
and
we
think
that
the
bona
fide
error
clearly
under
lamie
encompasses--
mr.
george
s.
coakley
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
but
let
that
--
well,
maybe
for
the
prior
group
that
was
up
here,
but
i
don't--
[laughter]
it's
big
in
cleveland.
mr.
george
s.
coakley
this
is
definitely
a
class
action.
this
is
a
class
action
that
wants
all
of
the
validation
notices
that
were
sent
out
by
this
law
firm
to
--
that
included
the
words
500,000
or
1
%
of
the
net
worth
of
the
firm,
which
is
ever
less.
so
the
request
was
made
of
my
client,
give
me
the
financials
of
your
law
firm,
and
for
some
reason,
my
client
did,
but
this
--
the
statute
was
not
meant
to
punish
lay
debt
collectors,
including
lawyers.
the
bona
fide
error
defense
is
the
shield,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
