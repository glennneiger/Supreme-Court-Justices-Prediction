justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
--
the
part
that's
worrying
me
most
is
where
the
lawyer
is
the
debt
collector.
all
right?
so
he's
within
the
act,
and
he
has
a
client
of
debt
collectors,
and
the
clients
all
say:
please
go
collect
the
debt.
and
they
say:
we
want
to
do
this,
like
in
this
--
suppose
in
this
case,
they
say:
tell
us
if
you
don't
owe
it;
ask
them
to
write
a
letter
to
that
effect;
we
won't
collect
it;
now,
is
that
legal?
and
the
lawyer
looks
up
everything
in
sight
and
says,
yes,
it's
legal.
and
then
that's
what
he
thinks.
all
the
circuits
have
said
this.
and
then
he
asks
the
ftc
and
they
say,
yes,
it's
legal.
so
there
he
is.
everybody's
told
him
it's
legal.
and
lo
and
behold,
this
court,
surprisingly,
holds
the
opposite.
well,
he
shouldn't
be
liable.
and
if
he
has
to
worry
about
that,
he
can
never
defend
his
client.
the
only
answer
is:
whatever
the
man
says
who
is
opposed
to
your
client,
that's
what
you
have
to
do.
that
can't
be
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
what
the
ftc
said
is:
we
won't
give
you
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
is
a
lawyer
litigating
for
a
client.
that
was
my
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
a
mistake.
the
point
is,
in
a
sense,
that
any
decent
lawyer
would
say
that's
what
the
law
was;
that
sometimes
lawyers
get
surprised
because
courts
don't
always
act
the
way
they
think
is
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
aren't
they
in
good
faith?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
but
that's
in
your
view
of
it.
i
am
saying
that
the
opposite
view
of
it
is
that
your
view
of
it
puts
lawyers
in
an
impossible
position,
let
alone
the
client.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
--
it's
not
just
that
it's
unfair.
it's
worse
than
unfair.
the
lawyer
is
under
an
obligation
to
represent
his
client,
and
he
cannot
do
anything
but
tell
the
client:
just
pay
money
to
this
particular
plaintiff
whose
view
of
the
law
is
totally
contrary
to
every
circuit
court
that's
ever
decided
it.
now,
how
can
you
put
lawyers
in
that
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
--
but
it
suggests
that
you
would
like
a
--
a
sensible
interpretation
of
this
that
avoids
the
result
i
said,
if
possible.
and
there
is
a
different
way
of
going
about
it,
which
is
you
could
say
that
a
bona
fide
error
in
respect
to
a
lawyer
imposes
much
higher
standards
on
that
lawyer
than
it
does
on
most
--
and
it's
simply
a
client
--
that
before
you
can
call
an
error
bona
fide,
that
lawyer
really
has
to
look
into
it.
he
has
to
have
asked
the
ftc.
he
has
to
have
gotten
--
and
made
an
effort
to
get
a
letter
back.
and
if
there
are
one
or
two
circuits
that
hold
the
other
way,
well,
where?
and
if
you
don't,
you
are
not
bona
fide.
now,
that
would
get
to
virtually
the
same
place
but
it
would
protect
the
lawyer
against
true
legal
surprise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
--
how
do
we
do
that?
because
you
see,
you
are
quite
right.
the
client
runs
the
same
risk
in
antitrust
law
in
a
whole
other
lot
of
areas.
absolutely
right.
but
once
you
bring
the
lawyer
into
it,
the
lawyer
has
what
he
doesn't
have
in
an
antitrust
case
under
your
reading,
which
is
an
incentive
to
distort
the
law
in
order
to
protect
his
own
pocketbook.
and
that
is,
to
me,
a
big
problem.
so
you
say
there
is
--
there
is
a
--
a
way
around
that.
and
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
lawyer
writes
a
letter
to
the
client.
the
first
thing
the
lawyer
tries
to
do
is
to
settle
the
case.
"dear
client:
please
send
me
the
money,
and
by
the
way,
if
you
don't
owe
it,
tell
me
in
writing.
"
okay?
that's
what
the
lawyer
does.
that's
a
legal
activity.
it's
at
the
heart
of
practicing
law,
because
nobody
goes
to
court
anymore.
and
--
though
he
will,
if
necessary,
so
he's
part
of
this.
now,
how
do
we
get
out
of
this
problem
that
i'm
putting?
i'm
really
looking
for
an
answer
to
that,
because
i
think
it's
a
big
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
your
colleague
can,
but
how
--
so
they
define
a
--
the
reasonable
error
falls
in
is
because
he's
a
person
who
regularly
collects
or
attempts
to
collect
consumer
debts
owed
to
a
--
you
know,
owed
to
another
person.
that's
pretty
broad.
that
doesn't
come
about
until
'86.
you
are
saying
the
bona
fide
language
there
is
before,
in
'77?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
but
then
what
--
how
--
but
i
still
can't
figure
out
how
we
get
this
thing
to
work
here,
and
--
and
you
just
came
up
with
a
new
idea.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
i
get
--
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true
of
antitrust
defendants,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
see
that.
is
it
--
is
it
--
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
that
your
opponent
here
has
suggested
that
the
way
to
deal
with
the
lawyer's
problem
that
i
mentioned
is
simply
read
the
substantive
provisions,
so
that
there
is
no
violation
for
ordinary
legal
activity
where
they
have
gone
and
asked
the
ftc
or
you
know,
all
the
things
that
are
against
them?
what
you
would
have
to
do.
that
isn't
so
hard
to
do
as
i
first
thought,
because
the
words
that
seem
to
make
--
the
primary
words
of
what
is
outlawed
are
the
words
"unfair
or
unconscionable
means".
now
i
--
i
doubt
--
you
would
know
--
i
doubt
that
there
are
other
words
in
the
statute
that
forbid
lawyers
from
doing
anything
that
really
shouldn't
be
forbidden.
i
mean,
they
shouldn't
call
people
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
harass
them
and
so
forth.
but
--
but
you
could
read
unfair
and
unconscionable
means
to
say
that
where
a
lawyer
is
really
hit
by
surprise,
you
know,
all
the
circuits
were
against
him,
the
ftc
wouldn't
give
him
an
opinion,
that
he
no
longer
is
acting
unfairly
and
unconscionably.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
i
was
seeing
a
special
problem
with
lawyers.
call
--
the
unfairness
problem
that
you
are
talking
about,
call
that
the
antitrust
problem,
because
it
is
just
as
much.
but
i
saw
the
special
problem
of
putting
the
lawyer
in
the
impossible
situation
that
you've
just
described.
now
it's
with
respect
to
that
problem
that
he
offers
the
cure
of
reading
the
words
"unconscionable"
and
what
is
it?
"unconscionable
and
unfair
means".
read
those
words
to
exempt
the
lawyer
when
he's
in
the
dilemma
i
discussed,
and
therefore
the
lawyer
will
not
have
an
incentive
to
--
to
skew
his
advice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
tell
me
if
you
know,
can
you
give
me
just
a
rough
idea,
of
the
percentage
of
instances
in
which
people
write
to
the
ftc
to
take
advantage
of
the
safe
harbor
and
the
ftc
just
says,
"well,
we
won't
tell
you.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
have
asked?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
obvious
solution
to
the
problem,
that
--
until
you
hold
they
are
not
--
they
are
liable
for
mistake
of
law,
but
anyone
can
write
to
the
ftc
ahead
of
time
and
--
and
get
a
safe
harbor.
it's
--
so
i
don't
know
what
we
could
do
to
suggest
maybe
that
mechanism,
which
is
built
into
the
statute,
should
be
used.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
but
i
mean,
if
there
have
been
seven
requests
and
four
answers
then
all
these
horrible
things
that
are
going
to
happen
if
you
do
say
there
is
--
unless
you
have
mistake
of
law
defense,
aren't
going
to
happen.
because
all
that
has
to
happen
is
that
people
write
to
the
ftc
and
they
get
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
means
lawyer,
if
you
are
worried
about
this,
go
write
before
you
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
now
i
do
see
--
which
is
why
i
asked
the
question,
i
asked
to
get
an
answer,
and
the
answer
now
seems
to
be
floating
around
the
ftc
idea.
it's
--
seven
letters,
that
isn't
very
much.
i
just
wonder
if
the
--
if
the
bar
in
this
area,
and
their
clients,
if
they
made
an
effort,
might
be
able
to
get
the
financing
for
the
ftc
so
they
could
have
enough
people
to
respond
quickly
to
the
letter.
[laughter]
