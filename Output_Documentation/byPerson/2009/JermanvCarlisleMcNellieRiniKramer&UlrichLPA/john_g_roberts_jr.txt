chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-1200,
jerman
v.
carlisle,
mcnellie,
rini,
kramer,
&
ulrich.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
--
reading
"intentional"
the
way
you
just
articulated
is
absolutely
right,
but
when
you
add
--
i
don't
see
what
work
"bona
fide
error"
does
in
the
statute,
if
"intentional"
should
be
read
in
this
case
to
mean
what
you
say.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
say:
well,
intentional
means
you
meant
to
send
out
the
document;
you
meant
to
serve
it;
in
other
words,
no
specific
intent
requirement.
but
if
--
a
bona
fide
error,
it
seems,
doesn't
make
the
activity
not
intentional
under
the
traditional
understanding
of
intentional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
are
sort
of
begging
the
question
there.
i
mean,
the
antitrust
laws
also
don't
have
a
bona
fide
error
defense,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
includes
a
legal
mistake
defense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
--
one
of
the
things
you
have
to
include
on
this
initial
communication
is
the
name
of
the
creditor,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
let's
say
the
bank
that
is
the
creditor
is
being
sold
or
taken
over.
and,
you
know,
you
have
heard
that,
well,
they
have
merged,
but,
you
know,
the
closing
date
of
the
merger
is
two
months
later
or
whatever.
it's
just
not
clear
what
the
name
of
the
creditor
is.
so
you
--
you
are
not
a
lawyer,
but
you
are
trying
to
collect
the
debt,
and
you
go
--
you
fill
in,
i
--
it's
either
a
or
b,
and
you
say:
i
think
it's
a,
and
you
fill
it
in
and
it
turns
out
that
it's
--
it's
b.
let's
say
that's
a
bona
fide
error.
okay?
but
if
you
are
sitting
there
as
the
debt
collector
and
you
say:
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
or
b.
and
you
say:
i
know;
i'll
call
the
lawyer.
you
call
the
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
says:
oh,
it's
--
it's
b
--
i
mean,
it's
--
it's
a.
and
you
put
down
a
and
it
turns
out
it's
wrong,
aren't
--
you
are
in
a
worse
position
if
you
ask
the
lawyer
than
if
you
didn't,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
a
--
it's
a
legal
--
the
lawyer
looks
at
it
and
says:
well,
you
know,
the
merger
is
not
going
to
close
for
whatever,
but
i
think
it's
still
this
bank.
and
it
turns
out
his
legal
analysis
of
who
the
creditor
is
was
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
the
client
just
says:
i'm
not
going
to
ask
the
lawyer;
i'm
just
going
to
make
--
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
bona
fide
error,
but
it's
an
error
--
he
gets
the
benefit
of
that
position.
but
if
he
asks
the
lawyer,
he
doesn't
get
the
benefit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
the
--
who
the
creditor
is
is
necessarily
a
mistake
of
law,
rather
than
fact?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
it
a
mistake
of
fact
if
the
lawyer
does
legal
research
to
find
it
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
looks
and
he
says:
well,
it
depends
upon
the
date
of
the
closing
of
the
merger,
not
the
announcement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
turns
out
that's
a
legal
mistake.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
many
times
have
they
answered
in
the
past
decade?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
not
a
very
realistic
procedure
to
rely
on,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
why
is
that?
because
it's
a
little
difficult
dealing
with
the
ftc
bureaucracy
and
getting
an
answer
from
them
in
a
reasonable
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
that
the
debt
collection
industry
doesn't
does
ask
the
ftc,
which
would
be
a
safe
harbor
for
them,
because
if
they
get
a
bad
answer,
they
may
not
follow
it
and
then
they
may
be
subject
to
heightened
penalties?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
are
four
of
them.
i
don't
care
how
public
they
are.
there
are
four
of
them
over
the
past
10
years.
it's
not
a
very
reliable
or
usable
effort
to
clarify
the
law
and
address
the
problem
that
the
statute
presents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
that's
wrong,
it
doesn't
do
you
any
good.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
jay.
mr.
coakley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
it
would
make
interpretation
of
the
act
a
little
more
difficult.
the
same
practice
would
be
unconscionable
in
--
not
unconscionable
in
one
circumstance,
you
would
have
an
opinion
saying
this
is
not
unconscionable;
but
yet
if
somebody
else
does
it,
you
know,
two
weeks
later,
that
doesn't
have
the
same
--
he
says,
well,
look,
it's
not
unconscionable,
but
it
turns
out
it
is,
in
his
case.
and
it
would
have
to
be
--
the
opinion
would
have
to
clarify
the
law
by
saying,
this
is
normally
unconscionable
but
we
are
going
to
say
it's
not
here
because
of
this
activity
that
is
unlikely
to
happen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
issue
is
still
not
settled,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
still
don't
know
if
the
lawyer
here
was
right
or
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
mean,
you're
--
the
substance
of
your
answer
is
that
they
are
just
two
very
different
statutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
--
but
i
share
justice
scalia's
concern,
i
mean
the
--
the
ways
in
which
they
are
different
would
suggest
you
need
the
legal
mistake
defense
more
in
tila
than
you
do
in
the
fdcpa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
see
i
have
a
copy
in
the
retail
--
association
of
retail
collection
trades.
the
first
--
second
sentence
in
the
ftc's
response
is
i
apologize
for
the
delay
in
responding
to
your
request.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
not
an
atypical
issue
in
dealing
with
government
agencies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-1200,
jerman
versus
carlisle.
