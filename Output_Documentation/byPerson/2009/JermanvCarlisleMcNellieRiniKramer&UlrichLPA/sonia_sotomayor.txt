justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
if
the
district
court
were
to
say:
you
violated
the
act;
this
was
a
mistake
of
law
not
covered,
but
i'm
not
awarding
statutory
damages
because--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
this
case,
just
for
the
reasons
here,
you
did
something
the
sixth
circuit
--
or
that
the
circuit
law
said
was
permissible,
so
you
didn't
do
it
--
you
did
it
intentionally
because
you
did
the
violation
of
the
act,
but
it
was
based
on
a
mistake
of
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
congress
wrote
this
statute
to
--
to
have
a
cottage
industry
of
litigation.
these
were
attorneys--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
before
our
heintz
decision,
that
they
intended
for
debt
collectors
to
have
an
automatic
defense
if
they
just
called
up
a
lawyer?
and
so
a
lawyer's
opinion
would
give
them
absolute
immunity
from
liability?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
think
part
of
the
difficulty
in
this
case,
isn't
it,
is
the
--
is
our
heintz
decision
which
made
lawyers
debt
collectors,
and
so
now
we
are
in
this
quandary
about
a
lawyer's
good
faith.
but
--
but
if
we
start
with
what
was
understood
at
the
time,
do
you
think
that
this
language
was
intended
to
give
debt
collectors
immunity
by
simply
calling
a
lawyer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
call
a
lawyer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
call
a
lawyer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
have
a
lawyer
sign
off.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
if
the
lawyer
made
a
mistake,
if
the
debt
collector
relies,
you
know,
i
have
a
reputable
law
firm,
they
are
well
educated,
they
tell
me
they
do
legal
research,
that
--
i
can
assume
that,
so
why
don't
i
have
a
"get
out
of
jail"
card?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
were
there
any
district
court
decisions,
of
any
kind,
reading
bona
fide
errors
to
mean
legal
mistakes
under
any
of
the
other
statutes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
ones
that
were
not
changed,
the
ones
that
justice
ginsburg
is
--
is
describing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
tila,
that's
why
congress
may
or
may
not
have
acted--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
talking
about
under
this
statute,
under
any
other
statute
that
uses
similar
language.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
were
there
any
district
court
cases
that
were
reading
those
statutes
to
include
mistakes
of
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
was
after
the
tila
amendment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
was
talking
about
the
time
that
congress
was
look
at
amending
the
statutes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
imposes
liability
on
debt
collectors
for
certain
prohibited
dept
collection
practices.
the
act
provides
however
a
so-called
bona
fide
error
defense.
under
that
defense
a
debt
collector
can
avoid
liability
by
showing
that
a
violation
of
the
act
was
“not
intentional
and
resulted
from
a
bonafide
error
notwithstanding
the
maintenance
of
procedures
reasonably
adapted
to
avoid
any
such
error”.
the
petition
filed
this
lawsuit
alleging
that
respondents
a
law
firm
and
one
of
its
attorneys
violated
the
act
in
attempting
to
collect
the
debt.
the
district
court
found
that
the
bona
fide
error
defense
shielded
respondents
for
liability,
for
the
violation
in
question,
which
had
resulted
from
their
misunderstanding
of
the
act’s
legal
requirements,
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
bona
fide
error
defense
does
not
apply
to
violations
that
result
from
the
debt
collector’s
misinterpretation
of
the
act’s
legal
requirements.
our
holding
follows
from
the
statute's
text,
structure
and
history
and
in
our
view
will
not
impose
unworkable
practical
burdens
on
employers
who
act
as
debt
collectors.
because
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
violations
resulting
from
mistaken
legal
interpretations
of
the
act
could
qualify
under
the
bona
fide
error
defense.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
that
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
alito
has
joined.
