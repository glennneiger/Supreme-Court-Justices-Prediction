mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
rarely
makes
ignorance
of
the
law
a
defense
to
civil
liability,
and
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
is
no
exception
to
that
rule.
while
it
may
seem
unfair
to
hold
defendants
in
some
sense
strictly
liable
for
legal
mistakes
in
the
civil
context,
the
accumulated
wisdoms
of
generations
of
legal
practice
has
been
that
attempting
to
fix
that
unfairness
through
a
mistake
of
law
defense
causes
more
harm
than
it
prevents.
and
as
a
consequence,
in
light
of
that
subtle
understanding,
courts
should
not
read
a
federal
statute
to
establish
a
mistake
of
law
defense,
unless
congress
quite
plainly
makes
that
intent
to
do
so
clear.
and
in
this
case,
nothing
in
the
text,
structure,
or
the
history
of
the
bona
fide
error
provision
of
the
fdcpa
indicates
such
an
intent.
i
could
begin
with
the
--
the
text
of
the
statute.
it
is
not
enough
under
the
bona
fide
error
provision
that
the
defendant's
violation
be
in
good
faith,
that
it
have
been
bona
fide.
there
is
an
additional
element,
that
the
defendant
has
to
show
that
the
violation
was
not
intentional.
and
in
common
legal
discourse,
a
violation
is
not
rendered
unintentional
simply
because
the
defendant
misunderstood
the
legal
consequences
of
its
actions.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
think
it
captures
the
circumstance
in
which
somebody
makes
a
mistake
of
fact,
but
does
so
and
with
--
not
in
good
faith.
i
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--but
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
both
provisions
do
separate
work,
and
so
that
if
all
it
took
to
show
that
something
wasn't
intentional
is
that
you
didn't
mean
to
violate
the
law,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
understand
what
work
"bona
fide"
was
doing
in
that
circumstance.
and
i
think
congress
included
the
bona
fide
requirement
in
order
to
capture
instances
in
which
people
make
factual
mistakes,
but
not
in
good
faith.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
that
is
the
central
question
here
and
it
is
respondents'
best
argument.
i
think
that
the
word
"violation"
is
best
understood
to
refer
to
the
act.
that
is
how
this
court
has
construed
that
word
in
the
statutory
phrase
"knowing
violation"
in
a
number
of
cases,
and
that's
how
the
courts
of
appeals
have
construed
the
term
"intentional"
--
or
"intentional
violation"
in
the
migrant
and
seasonal
agricultural
workers
protection
act,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
i
did
mention
in
our
brief
that
it
is
a
less
usual
formulation,
"intentional
violation",
and
at
the
time
we
wrote
our
briefs
we
weren't
able
to
find
any
cases
from
this
court
construing
that
particular
term.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
let
me
address
the
hypothetical,
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
if
we're
talking
--
well,
first
of
all,
if
we
are
talking
about
a
case
in
which
they've
asked
the
opinion
of
the
ftc,
they
are
entitled
to
the
safe
harbor
defense,
because
congress
specifically--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--okay.
well,
in
that
circumstance,
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
lawyers
who
are
simply
giving
advice
to
debt
collector
clients
--
they're
not
covered
by
the
act.
it's
only
when
the
lawyer
engages
in
debt
collection
activities
himself.
and
a
lot
of
the
time
the
debt
--
the
lawyer
is
simply--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes.
this
court
held
in
heintz
that
litigation
can
be
a
form
of--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--in
that
circumstance
--
in
that
circumstance,
i
think
yes,
the
lawyer
can
be
held
liable
for
--
for
mistakes.
but
to
the
extent
this
court--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--and
when
that
happens,
their
clients
are
almost
never
protected
from
liability,
for
--
because
they
did
what
their
lawyers
reasonably
told
them
to.
and
the
antitrust--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--the
lawyer?
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
certainly,
because
there
generally
is
a
mistake
of
law
defense.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
the
lawyers
are
not
in
a
terribly
different
position
than
is,
for
example,
the
executive
of
a
company
that
has
a
fiduciary
duty
to
its
shareholders
to
maximize
profits
and
is
considering
a
venture
that
could
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
and
in
that
circumstance,
they
have
to
make
a
calculated
judgment,
because
the
antitrust
laws
don't
have
a
mistake
of
law
defense.
and
neither
does
any
other
civil--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--that's
right.
and
my
--
my
point
simply
is
that
you
shouldn't
read
that
defense
as
necessarily
creating
a
mistake
of
law
defense
simply
because
you
think
it's
so
unfair,
because
that
unfairness
is
simply
common.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
do
think
that
if
you
disagree
with
us,
that's
the
better
reading
than
the
second.
that's
not
the
reading
most
courts
have
given.
it's
not
the
reading
that
the
sixth
circuit
gave
in
this
case.
but
i
think
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
if
congress
was
concerned
about
the
especially
problematic
application
of
this
statute
to
lawyer
conduct
and
particularly
to
litigation
conduct,
it
would
have
expected
courts
to
deal
with
that
in
different
way,
and
not
through
the
bona
fide
error
defense,
which,
after
all,
applies
to
lawyer
who
are
engaging
in
the
same
conduct
as
lay
debt
collectors
and
to
nonlawyers
alike.
it's
a
very
blunt
instrument
for
dealing
with
this
problem.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
because
in
either
circumstance
it
would
be
a
factual
error.
it
would
be
subject
to
the
bona
fide
error
defense.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
again,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
a
legal
--
but
assuming
that
it
is
a
legal
mistake--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
that
the
client
is
not
--
i
mean,
if
it's
a
legal
mistake,
it's
a
legal
mistake
for
the
client
as
well
as
the
lawyer,
and
i
think
either
one
of
them
would
be
in
the
same
position--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
under
our
view,
he
wouldn't
get
benefit
under
either
circumstance,
because
it
would
be
a
mistake
of
law
and
the
statute
doesn't
cover
it.
if
i
could
finish
my
answer--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no.
that's
why
i
--
i
initially
told
you
i
thought
it
was
a
mistake
of
fact,
and
that
would
be
a
mistake
of
fact
for
the
lawyer
or
the
client.
and
i
think
actually,
in
that
scenario--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
if
the--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--then
i
--
i
don't
think
the
defense
would
apply
and
i
don't
think
it
would
apply
to
the
client,
either.
but
i
do
think
that
if
you
are
especially
concerned
about
applying
the
law
to
lawyers
and
to
litigation,
it's
much
more
likely
that
congress
intended
the
court
to
deal
with
that
in
a
tailored
way
by
interpreting
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
statute
with
that
particular
problem
in
mind.
knowing
that
congress
didn't
have
litigation
conduct
specifically
in
mind
when
it
enacted
this
statute,
because
at
the
time
lawyers
were
excluded
from
the
act
altogether,
and
keeping
in
mind
in
addition
that
congress
presumably
didn't
intend
the
act
to
unreasonably
interfere
with
litigation
collection
methods,
and
the
constitutional
aspects--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--and
that
is
to
recognize
that,
as
this
court
held
in
heintz,
that
congress
didn't
intend
for
every
unsuccessful
lawsuit
to
result
in
liability
under
this
statute.
plaintiffs
have
to
point
to
some
particular
provision
of
the
statute
that
was
violated
by
what
the
lawyer
did
in
litigation.
and
for
example,
the
lawyer
makes
a
mistake
about
the
statute
of
limitations.
some
courts
have
held
that
that
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
provisions
against
deceptive
practices
or
unconscionable
collection
practices--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
typically
--
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
uniquely
lawyerly
activity.
lay
debt
collectors
do
that
all
the
time.
but
to
the
extent
you
think
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
kind
of
activity
to
be
subject
to
liability
when
somebody
makes
a
reasonable
legal
error,
i
think
it's
more
likely
that
congress
intended
you
to
look
at
what
provision
of
the
statute
are
they
saying
was
violated
and
construe
that
provision
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
your
expectations
about
what
congress
would
have
meant,
rather
than
providing
--
rather
than,
you
know,
taking
the
bona
fide
error
provision
to
do
that
work,
when
the
bona
fide
error
provision
is
much
broader
and
would
apply
to
all
kinds
of
mistakes
of
law,
including
having
this
consequence
of
basically
giving
debt
collectors
the
opportunity
to
take
the
narrowest
possible
construction
of
--
of
consumers'
rights,
as
long
as
the
--
the
question
is
unsettled.
the
other
reason
to
think
that
congress
wouldn't
have
intended
this
to
be
the
solution
to
that
problem
is
that
at
the
time
they
wrote
the
bona
fide
error
defense,
lawyers
weren't
included,
so
this
could
not
have
been
congress'
intended
solution
to
that
particular
problem.
and
at
the
time
congress
used
this
language,
it
was
borrowing
it
from
the
truth
in
lending
act,
where
it
had
an
established
meaning
in
the
circuit
courts
as
not
including
the
mistake
of
law
defense,
and
that
remained
the
interpretation
of
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
provision
as
well,
for
--
for
nearly
25
years.
it
wasn't
until
2002
that
the
court
of
appeals
first
suggested
that
it
did
not
extend
to
legal
mistakes--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
they--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
do
think
that
that's
a
perfectly
permissible
exercise
of
discretion.
congress
gave
the
district
court
discretion
with
respect
to
statutory
damages,
and
that's
another
way
of
dealing
with
this
problem.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
the
attorneys'
fees
is
not
discretionary
in
that
sense.
and
so
there
are
other
structural
reasons,
though,
to
think
that
congress
knew
how
to
make
a
mistake
of
law
defense
clearly
and
did
not
do
so
here.
congress
did
provide,
in
effect,
a
mistake
of
law
defense
to
civil
penalties.
the
civil
penalties
provision
that
applies
to
this
statute,
which
is
at
15
u.s.c.
45(m)(1),
and
that's
quoted
in
relevant
part
on
page
24
of
the
blue
brief,
provides
for
very
serious
civil
penalties
for
somebody
who
acts
with
actual
knowledge
or
knowledge
fairly
implied
that
the
act
was
prohibited.
and
i
think
that
provision
shows
two
things.
one,
it
shows
that
congress
knows
how
to
make
an
express
--
how
to
expressly
speak
to
a
defendant's
knowledge
of
the
unlawfulness
of
his
conduct.
and
in
addition,
it
shows
that
congress
treated
knowledge
of
unlawfulness
as
an
aggravating
circumstance,
as
something
deserving
of
special
punishment,
rather
than,
as
respondents
would
have
it,
most
of
the
time
being
a
minimum
prerequisite
for
any
liability
at
all.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
--
i
would
not
say
that.
i
would
say
that
congress
wrote
this
statute,
in
a
way,
to
encourage
private
enforcement,
to
be
sure.
it
enacted
statutory
damages
and
fee
shifting
because
it
understood
that
this
was
an
industry
in
which
there
was
a
particular
risk
of
very
aggressive
and
harmful
practices,
in
part
because
debt
collectors
don't
rely
on
the
good
will
of
the
consumers
they
deal
with
in
order
to
prosper.
and
so
all
of
the
economic
incentives
in
the
industry
push
people
to
aggressive
practices,
and
congress
wanted
this
statute
to
be
a
counterweight
to
that.
and
as
in
many
circumstances,
congress
enacts
statutory
language
and
puts
up
requirements
and
holds
people
to
them
civilly
because
the
--
the
general
rule
in
our
legal
system
is
that
the
risk
and
the
cost
of
a
legal
mistake
is
generally
allocated
to
the
lawbreaker
in
the
civil
context
and
not
to
the
people's
whose
rights
have
been
violated.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
was
acting
particularly
differently
here.
we
were
speaking
earlier
on
about
the
words
"intentional
violation",
and
i
wanted
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
after
we
filed
our
brief,
and
in
fact,
last
night,
we
--
we
did
find
a
case
in
which
this
court
construed
that
term,
and
we
notified
respondents'
counsel
and
the
united
states.
and
i
just
want
to
give
you
the
cite
so
you
can
look
at
it.
it's
ellis
v.
united
states,
206
u.s.
246.
the
relevant
passage
is
at
page
257.
it's
a
1907
opinion
from
justice
holmes.
and
it's
consistent
with
the
way
that
the
court
has
construed
the
phrase
"knowing
violation"
in
a
number
of
contexts,
including
in
--
in
the
criminal
context,
where
it's
much
more
common
for
congress
to
make
a
mistake
of
law
a
defense
to
liability.
i
mentioned
before
that
that
kind
of
history
of
the
development
of
the
statute
--
i
think
it's
also
worth
noting,
justice
breyer,
that
at
the
time,
congress
withdrew
the
attorney
exemption
from
the
act.
it
was
the
uniform
opinion
of
the
courts
of
appeals
at
that
time
and
all
the
district
courts
that
the
language
of
the
bona
fide
error
defense
did
not
create
a
mistake
of
law
defense.
and
again,
congress
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
in
subjecting
the
attorneys
to
that
statutory
regime,
that
the
bona
fide
error
provision
would
be
the
solution
to
any
special
problems.
and
congress
has
also
shown
itself
to
be
attentive
to
this
special
area
of
concern.
in
2006,
it
made
a
tailored
adjustment
to
the
statute
to
make
clear
that
pleadings
are
not
an
initial
communication
triggering
the
validation
notice
requirement.
and
i
think
that
demonstrates
that
congress
is
--
is
on
top
of
this
issue,
and
it
stands
at
the
ready
to
make
adjustments
that
are
necessary
to
make
this
legal
system
operate
in
a
way
that
both
makes
sense,
but
nonetheless
gives
effect
to
their
intent
to
treat
attorney
debt
collectors
on
a
par
with
regular
debt
collectors
who
are
not
attorneys.
i
should
also
mention,
justice
breyer,
to
the
extent
there
are
some
really
intractable
problems
with
respect
to
the
act
application
to
attorneys,
there
--
there
is
ongoing
litigation
in
the
lower
courts
about
the
noerr-pennington
doctrine
about
how
the
constitutional
implications
of
regulating
in-court
activity
apply
to
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
statutory
provisions.
and
again,
i
think
it's
more
likely
that
that
is
the
solution
congress
would
have
intended,
an
interpretive
solution--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes.
and
at
the--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
no.
it's
--
again,
it's
the
same
idea,
that
you
construe
the
provisions
in
a
way
that
avoid
the
most
troublesome
applications
of
it
to
attorney
conduct.
so
i
was
giving
the
example
of
state
statutes
of
limitations.
i
think
it's
very
open
to
dispute
whether
attempting
to
collect
a
debt
on
which
the
limitations
period
has
run
constitutes
an
unfair
or
deceptive
practice,
because
there's
not
a
--
all
it
does
is
gives
the
--
the
debtor
the
opportunity
to
raise
an
affirmative
defense.
and
i
think
--
you
know,
in
that
circumstance,
congress
would
not
have
intended
the
statute
to--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--thank
you.
