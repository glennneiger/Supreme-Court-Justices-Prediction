justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
think
that
the
--
the
word
that
we're
wrestling
with
here
is
the
--
the
word
"intentional".
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
word
"violation",
because
violation
--
when
it
says
the
violation
was
intentional
or
unintentional,
does
"violation"
mean
the
act
that
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
law,
or
does
"violation"
mean
the
--
the
fact
of
violating
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
litigation
constitute
debt
--
debt
collection
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
ask
and
they
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
coakley,
one
of
your
earlier
statements
confused
me.
you
relied
upon
the
fact
that
tila
was
amended
in
1980
to
provide
that
legal
errors
are
not
covered
by
the
tila
defense,
and
i
think
you
--
i
think
you
describe
that
as
--
as
changing
the
law
to
--
to
provide
that
--
that
legal
errors
were
not
covered.
but
as
i
understood
the
situation,
every
court
of
appeals
to
have
construed
tila
prior
to
1980
had
held
that
legal
errors
were
not
--
were
not
included,
as
--
as
your
opponent
says,
they
are
not
included
here.
so
the
amendment
to
tila
was
just
an
affirmation
of
the
judicial
interpretation
of
the
language
similar
to
the
language
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
every
court
of
appeals
to
construe
it
had
held
that
mistakes
of
law
were
not
covered.
is
that
accurate
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
--
then
your
prior
statement
was
very
misleading.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
the
amendment
was
overturning
--
changing
the
prior
meaning
of
tila.
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that.
all
you
had
were
just
a
few
district
court
opinions,
and
all
the
courts
of
appeals
have
come
out
the
other
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
all
--
which
way
do
these
cut?
i
mean,
the
fact
that
there
is
criminal
liability
under
tila
would
seem
to
me
to
cut
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction.
you
would
want
to
provide
excuses
of
bona
fide
errors
of
law,
i
would
think.
why
--
am
i
missing
something
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
coakley,
why
do
you
need
a
safe
harbor
if
there
is
no
store?
i
mean
what
is
the
purpose
of
--
of
having
this
procedure,
however
inefficient
it
may
be,
what
is
the
purpose
of
having
it
unless
you
were
going
to
be
liable
if
you
make
a
mistake
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
talking
about
a
safe
harbor
rule.
leave
the
harbor.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
have
to
do
--
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
anything,
whether
it's
prospective
or
not?
the
point
is
what
benefit
does
it
give
to
the
person
who
is
asking?
if
the
person
is
not
going
to
be
liable
for
a
bona
fide
mistake,
why
would
he
ever
use
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
severe
limits
on
the
liability,
aren't
there?
isn't
there
a
thousand
--
isn't
it
a
$1,000
limit?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
big
bucks
for
an
attorney,
is
it?
[laughter]
