even
if
the
--
even
if
the
error
of
law
is
completely
reasonable?
let's
say
in
this
case
the
sixth
circuit
had
a
case
directly
on
point.
still,
it
was
just
too
bad.
justice

do
you
think
that
a
--
a
mistake
of
law
has
to
be
substantively
reasonable
in
order
to
fall
within
this
defense,
and
if
so,
where
do
you
get
that?
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
that
a
lawyer
spends
a
whole
week
researching
a
question,
but
arrives
at
a
conclusion
that
is
plainly
incorrect,
does
not,
therefore,
intend
to
violate
the
statute
and
proceeds
in
good
faith.
would
that
--
how
would
that
work
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
decision,
and
yet,
would
it
--
it
would
fall
within
your
understanding
of
this
provision;
is
that
correct?
