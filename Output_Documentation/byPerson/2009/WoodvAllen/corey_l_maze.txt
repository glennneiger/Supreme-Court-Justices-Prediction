mr.
corey
l.
maze
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
based
on
the
court's
questioning
so
far,
i
believe
that
i,
as
did
every
amicus,
believe
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
are
the
actual
questions
listed
in
the
petition.
so
unless
this
court
has
an
objection,
i'm
going
to
focus
on
the
(d)(2)
question
and
how
it
interplays
with
(e)(1).
and
i
would
like
to
start
with
justice
ginsburg's
point
about
why
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
wrong.
and
other
than
the
plain
language,
which
was
what
we've
discussed
in
the
brief--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i
apologize.
you're
correct.
i
would
say
it's
wrong.
[laughter]
because
not
only
does
it
ignore
the
plain
language
and,
the
point
you
made
that
it
would
be
90
to
99
percent
of
the
time
it
would
cut
it
out,
the
problem
is
is
that
position
misses
the
bigger
picture.
(e)(1)
doesn't
only
apply
when
we're
looking
at
(d)(2)
claims.
in
fact,
(d)(2)
claims
are
a
very,
very
small
percentage
of
what
the
states
deal
with
in
habeas
work.
typically
what
we're
dealing
with
are
(d)(1)
claims
or
claims
that
weren't
even
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
the
state
court.
let's
say
it
was
procedurally
barred
in
the
state
court
and
we're
looking
at
the
procedural
default
rule.
if
you're
looking
at
applying
the
rule
that
judge
kozinski
has
forwarded
in
the
ninth
circuit,
they
would
say
that
(e)(1)
is
completely
eviscerated
if
there
is
no
extrinsic
evidence,
even
if
we're
looking
at
a
(d)(1)
claim
and
even
if
we're
looking
at
a
procedurally
barred
claim.
so--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--yes,
(e)(1)
is
always
going
to
have
an
application.
we
would
say
that
it
has
an
application
at
the
moment
the
petition
is
filed.
that
is,
every
single
subsidiary
finding
of
fact
is
presumed
to
be
true.
let's
take
a
(d)(1)
example,
terry
williams
v.
taylor.
this
court
said
that
you
could
overcome
the
(d)(1)
bar
in
terry
williams
because
they
had
applied
the
wrong
law,
they
had
applied
lockhart
to
strickland's
prejudice
inquiry.
so
you
jumped
over
the
(d)(1)
bar.
at
that
point
you
look
at
the
claim
de
novo.
but
(e)(1)
still
has
application.
its
application
is
--
is
every
finding
of
fact
that
the
state
court
made
that
goes
towards
the
prejudice
determination
is
presumed
to
be
correct.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
correct.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
and
that
is
the
difficulty.
again,
(d)(2)
is
very
limited,
the
times
we
use
it.
but
yes,
it
is
tough
because
you
see
both
a
"clear
and
convincing"
and
an
"objectively
unreasonable"
standard.
but
the
way
to
fix
the
problem
is
not
to
cut
(e)(1)
out
altogether
for
every
type
of
claim.
it's
to
try
to
find
a
way
to
be
able
to
work
(e)(1)
and
the
(d)(2)
standard
together.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
let's
take
this
case--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
let's
take
--
let's
take
this
case,
for
example.
let's
switch
the
facts
just
a
little
bit
and
let's
say
that
the
state
court
had
made
four
findings
of
fact.
the
first
one
is
all
three
counsel
read
the
kirkland
report.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
the
second
fact
is
that
all
three
counsel
talk
to
each
other
for
4
days
about
the
kirkland
report.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
the
third
fact
is
carey
dozier,
lead
counsel,
made
the
decision
not
to
seek
another
evaluation;
and
the
fourth
fact
is
is
that
carey
dozier,
lead
counsel,
decided
not
to
present
the
kirkland
report
or
similar
evidence
to
the
jury.
those
are
your
four
facts
that
are
presumed
correct
under
(e)(1).
mr.
corey
l.
maze
the
reason--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--the
reason
that
you
go
under
(e)(1)
is
because
congress
has
said
that
you
have
to.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
again,
the
problem
is,
is
because
we're
looking
at
an
(e)(1)-(d)(2)
situation,
but
that's
not
the
only
situation.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
correct.
and
justice--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--no.
and
justice
alito,
if
--
the
way
you
said
it
is
exactly
where
i
was
going
with
my
hypothetical.
but--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--the
fourth--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
because
i
would
come
back
with
the
saying
that
this
is
almost
like
having,
because
(d)(2)
is
so
limited
in
what
we
do,
you
have
a
toe
ache
but
you're
asking
us
to
cut
the
leg
completely
off.
i
mean,
there's
a
much
broader
use
of
(e)(1)--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--correct.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
that
is
not
the
position
we
took.
that
position
is
what
the
court
ended
up
doing
in
rice
v.
collins,
saying
that
even
if
we
don't
answer
the
question,
the
state
wins.
and
you
could
do
the
same
thing
here,
too,
that
the
strategic
decision,
finding
of
fact
is
not
unreasonable.
but
we're
trying
to
help
the
court
find
a
way
to
make
(e)(1)
and
(d)(2)
work
together.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i
agree.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
if
the
court
would
come
back
and
say
that
(e)(1)
applies
when
the
petition
is
filed
and
that
if
you're
outside
the
(d)(2)
claim
--
(e)(1)
is
not
tethered
to
the
introduction
of
extrinsic
evidence,
it
simply
applies.
but
then
you
came
back
and
said
in
the
limited
circumstances
in
which
we
have
a
(d)(2)
claim
--
not
a
(d)(1)
or
a
procedurally
barred
claim,
but
a
(d)(2)
claim
--
if
the
court
came
back
and
said
we're
going
to
treat
objectionably
unreasonable
as
the
equivalent
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
--
that
means
if
you
can
prove
that
something
is
objectively
unreasonable,
it
also
proves
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
it's
wrong
--
then
that
would
not
be
a
problem.
but
again,
what
we're
saying
to
the
court
is,
is
if
you
say
that,
you
need
to
also
say
that
(e)(1)
is
still
not
tethered
to
extrinsic
evidence
--
evidentiary
hearings,
because
(e)(1)
applies
in
a
much
broader
scope
that
just
the
(d)(2)
question.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
correct.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no.
let
me
--
let
me
be
clear.
i
was
asking
justice
breyer's
question
about
how
he
could
write
it.
i
agree
that
our--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
correct.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i
agree.
and,
again,
my
position
is
just
what
justice
alito
had
said
earlier,
that's
the
step-by-step
way
that
we
would
approach
it.
that
is
the
way--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--work
it
out
in
theory.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i
did.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
correct.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
if
i
could
finish
the
hypothetical
earlier,
i
think
i
can
show
how
(e)(1)
and
(d)(2)
can
both
have
effect
in
the
same
case.
again,
we
talked
about
the
four
facts
that
might
lead
to
the
strategic
decision.
let's
say
that
the
state
court
record
proves
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
three
counsel
never
spoke
to
each
other
at
all
about
the
kirkland
report,
and
that
has
been
proved
wrong
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
but
you
have
the
other
three
subsidiary
findings
of
fact.
then
you
go
to
(d)(2).
you
ask
is
an
objectionably
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts,
facts
plural,
which
is
how
(d)(2)
works,
to
say
that
a
strategic
decision
was
made?
well,
the
answer
would
be,
no,
it's
not
objectionably
unreasonable,
because
we
still
know
it's
presumed
correct
that
mr.
dozier
read
the
report
and
he
made
the
decision.
so--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--that
would
be
(d)(1).
if
you--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--correct.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
the
answer
would
than
under
2254
(d)(1)
you
could
overcome
the
habeas
bar
for
penalty
phase
because
you
have
shown
an
unreasonable
application
of
strickland
to
the
facts
that
we
have
shown
to
be
correct.
again,
we
don't
believe
that's
the
question
presented,
but
the
(d)(2)
question
is
whether
a
strategic
decision
was
factually
made.
and
if
i
may--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--yes.
and
--
and
in
this
case,
the
factual
finding,
the
strategic
decision
was
twofold.
the
strategic
decision
was
not
to
seek
a
further
mental
health
evaluation
after
reading
and
conferring
about
the
kirkland
report
and
not
to
introduce
the
kirkland
report
or
similar
evidence
to
the
penalty
phase
jury.
that's
the
question
of
historical
fact
that
you're
making
under
(d)(2).
and
that
determination
of
historical
fact
we
can
show
by
the
record
is
not
objectively
unreasonable.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
move
to
justice
ginsburg's
questions
earlier
about
what
in
the
record
or
her
point
about
what
in
the
record
shows
that
mr.
dozier
was
actually
thinking
about
the
penalty
phase
when
he
made
the
decision.
and
there
are
four
parts
of
the
record
that
show
he
specifically
had
the
penalty
phase
in
mind
when
he
made
the
decision.
the
first
is
what
justice
ginsburg
had
pointed
out,
is
that
when
he
sought
the
penalty
phase
about
the
--
the
competency
report,
the
kirkland
report,
on
page
150
of
the
joint
appendix
he
testified
that
one
reason
was
the
fact
he
wanted
mitigating
evidence.
the
second
piece
of
evidence--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--well,
point
two
was
not
put
in
his
mouth.
point
two
is
page
140
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
was
specifically
asked,
do
you
--
did
you
call
any
witnesses
in
mitigation?
and
his
answer
was,
i
don't
recall.
i
know
that
we
talked
a
lot
to
psychologists
and
so
forth.
the
specific
question
was,
do
you
remember
talking
to
any
witnesses
for
mitigation
purposes.
and
the
first
thing
that
mr.
dozier
remembered
was
we
did
talk
to
psychologists
for
mitigation
purposes.
the
clearest
piece
of
evidence
is
page
283
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
that
is
quote
where
trotter
is
asked
about
the
kilby
--
i
mean
the
taylor
harden
report
from
dr.
kirkland,
and
the
part
we
keep
quoting
is
the
fact
he
said
that
cary
dozier
came
and
told
me
that
we
didn't
need
a
further
evaluation.
but
what
we
haven't
put
in
the
brief
and
brought
up
until
now
is
the
rest
of
the
quote.
again,
it's
on
page
283
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
he
starts
off
right
after
the
dash
saying
he,
meaning
cary
dozier,
determined
that
we
didn't
need
any
further
evaluators
and
no
further
recall
because
in
the
course
of
my
preparation,
"my"
being
trotter,
in
course
of
my
preparation
for
the
penalty
phase
i
would
read
things
about
different
psychological
evaluations
and
had
raised
that
to
him.
and
again
he
looked
at
the
report
and
thought
that
that
wouldn't
be
needed.
so
at
the
moment
cary
dozier
made
the
decision
and
told
to
it
trotter,
it
was
specifically
because
trotter
had
come
to
him
and
said,
i
am
getting
ready
for
the
penalty
phase,
just
as
i
was
told.
i
have
been
reading
things
about
having
mental
health
evaluations.
on
the
page
before,
282,
he
has
just
said
that,
i
could
see
issues,
but
because
i
was
the
young
attorney,
i
relied
on
the
senior
attorneys
to
resolve
them.
so
he
goes
to
cary
dozier
and
says
i
have
read
all
of
these
things
about
mental
health
evaluations
for
the
penalty
phase,
should
we
do
another
one?
and
cary
dozier,
lead
counsel
of
22
years,
criminal
experience
on
both
sides,
says,
i
have
read
the
kirkland
report,
we
do
not
need
a
further
evaluation.
it
was
the
very
next
month
that
counsel
filed
a
motion
to
exclude
all
psychological
evidence,
and
the
reason
was,
as
mr.
trotter
told
the
trial
court
in
the
trial
court
record
on
pages
2
--
of
72
and
73,
we
don't
want
the
state
to
introduce
evidence
that
he
is
prone
to
violent
behavior,
prone
to
violent
behavior
being
the
quote.
and
the
trial
court
asked
mr.
trotter
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
the
state
will
do
that?
he
said
the
report
that
was
done
at
taylor
harden,
that
being
dr.
kirkland's
report.
so,
here
we
are
six
weeks
before
trial
they
are
fighting
to
exclude
evidence
that
he
is
prone
to
violent
behavior
and
specifically
referring
to
the
kirkland
report.
again,
because
the
very
month
before
cary
dozier
had
told
trotter
we
will
not
have
another
evaluation
done
because
i
have
read
the
kirkland
report
and
we
are
not
going
to
do
it
any
further.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yeah.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no,
at
the
trial
it
did
not.
and
in
fact,
the
state--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--absolutely.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
are
you
talking
about
in
front
of
the
judge?
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no,
the
jury
never
found
out
about
it,
because
trotter
and
dozier
fought
to
keep
it
out.
and,
in
fact,
had
the
kirkland
report
been
admitted
or
had
counsel
followed--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
i
think
your
point
is,
is
that
there
was
no
way
they
were
could
prevent
the
jury
from
hearing
about
the
other
sort
of
violent
behavior
he
had
except
for
keeping
out
the
mental
health.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
jury.
the
penalty
phase
jury--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--correct.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
let
me
see
if
i'm
understanding
the
question
correctly.
you're
saying
that
let's
assume
that
it
was
strategic
not
to
allow
the
jury
that
gives
the
advisory
verdict
that
can
turn
into
a
mitigating
circumstance
the
ability
to
find
out
about
the
previous
assault
and
all
of
his
other
prior
assaults,
but
not
to
seek
a
further
evaluation
in
time
for
the
judge,
who
makes
the
ultimate
sentence,
that's
your
question?
mr.
corey
l.
maze
all
right.
under
alabama
law,
you
have
one
trial.
you
have
the
expert
witnesses
testify
in
front
of
the
jury.
the
time
gap
between
the
judge
hearing
it
and
the
jury
making
their
initial
penalty
phase
advisory
verdict
is
simply
so
a
presentence
investigation
report
can
be
made.
in
this
case,
the
presentence
investigation
report
was
made.
the
two
prior
psychological
evaluations
were
attached
to
it
by
our
rule
26.3.
it's
--
let
me
be
honest.
it
is
an
open
question
under
alabama
law
whether
you
can
present
new
witnesses
and
new
evidence
in
front
of
the
sentencing
judge.
the
alabama
courts,
in
a
case
called
boyd
v.
state,
and
i
will
give
you
the
cite,
it's
746
so.2nd
364,
and
the
pinpoint
is
398,
had
said
counsel
cannot
be
ineffective
for
failing
to
put
on
new
witnesses
and
new
experts
in
front
of
the
sentencing
judge
because
our
statute
doesn't
give
you
the
opportunity,
doesn't
allow
for
it.
all
that
the
sentencing
hearing
in
front
of
the
judge
is
for
is
for
the
judge
to
allow
counsel
to
give
a
final
argument
after
the
presentence
investigation
report
has
come
in
and
counsel
has
ensured
that
it's
correct.
we
have
had
a
federal
district
court
say
that,
i
believe
that's
unconstitutional,
i
don't
think
you
should
be
allowed
to
prevent
counsel
from
presenting
new
evidence
in
front
of
the
judge,
in
the
way
you're
suggesting;
but,
again,
that's
open
--
it's
an
open
question.
the
point
here
is,
though,
that's
not
the
claim
that
was
adjudicated
in
front
of
the
state
court,
and,
again,
this
is
aedpa
2254(d).
the
only
merits
determination
made
by
the
state
court
and,
thus,
the
only
thing
this
court
can
hold
the
state
court
in
error
for,
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
strategic
decision
to
withhold
it
from
the
jury
and
whether
that
question
is
prejudicial
because
what
you
would
have
to
do--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i
agree.
if--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--there
is.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
if
i
may,
let
me
give
you
the
way
we
see
(e)(1)
working
on
a
broader
scope.
and
we
ran
into
the
problem
that
mr.
chief
justice
had
mentioned
earlier,
about
how
(e)(1)
applies
to
(d)(2).
here's
how
we
believe
(e)(1)
works
altogether
under
aedpa:
a
petition
is
filed.
at
the
moment
that
petition
is
filed,
all
subsidiary
findings
of
fact
are
presumed
correct
under
(e)(1).
the
next
question
you
should
answer
should
be
will
extrinsic
evidence
come
in,
either
under
rule
7
through
affidavits,
et
cetera,
under
rule
8
in
evidentiary
hearing.
if
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
yes,
we
will
accept
extrinsic
evidence,
then
you
accept
the
extrinsic
evidence,
and
you
have
the
question
this
court
couldn't
answer
last
year
in
bell
v.
kelly.
how
does
2254(d)
work
after
that?
now,
let's
say
that
you
answer
the
question,
no,
you
will
not
have
extrinsic
evidence,
which
is
the
case
you
have
here,
and
you
move
over
the
2251(d)
bars.
if
they're
only
arguing
(d)(1),
you
don't
have
a
problem
because
you
simply
look
at
the
application.
the
problem
runs
in
when
you
have
a
(d)(2)
claim
with
new
extrinsic
evidence
--
with
no
extrinsic
evidence.
excuse
me.
the
way
i
think
that
it
should
work
and
the
way
it
will
work
all
the
way
down
the
line,
no
matter
how
the
court
comes
to
it,
is
to
say
that
the
smaller
subsidiary
findings
of
fact
are
presumed
correct
until,
in
this
case,
the
record
evidence
shows
that
they're
clear
and
convincingly
wrong.
an
example
of
that
would
be
miller-el
2.
in
miller-el
2,
you
found
that
the
state
record
evidence
proved
that
defining
that
there
was
sexual
abuse
in
the
--
in
the
state
court
records
was
proved
wrong
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
at
that
point,
you
can
say,
well,
it's
also
a
(d)(2)
violation
because
it's
objectively
unreasonable.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i
think
that,
in
two
minutes,
you've
said
it
better
than
i
did--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i
--
i
would
disagree.
i
think
the
district
courts
can
handle
that
question.
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
mean,
they've
been
handling
it
since
aedpa
came
out
in
'96.
i
see
that
my
time
is
almost
through.
i
want
to
make--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i
agree.
it's
difficult,
but
again,
that's
why
we're
saying
just
use
the
plain
language.
look
at
the
smaller
subsidiary
findings
of
fact,
to
see
whether
or
not
you
can
rebut
the
presumption,
and,
as
justice
scalia
said,
you
look
at
the
overall
decision
and
see
if
it
was
based
on
a
determination
of
facts,
a
larger
bundle
of
facts,
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
unreasonable.
again,
my
time
is
about
to
run
out.
i
want
to
make
one
final
point.
mr.
scanlon
has
said
that
prejudice
also
has
a
2254(d)
bar
in
it
in
this
case,
and
we
agree
with
that
because
there
was
a
merits
adjudication
on
prejudice.
i
would
simply
might
like
to
make
the
point,
regardless
of
how
the
court
comes
out
on
the
(d)(2)
question
on
deficient
performance,
it
cannot
overcome
the
2250(d)
bar
for
prejudice
here
because,
again,
simply
knowing
that
someone
had
the
low
iq
and
had
a
low
grammar
school
kind
of
education
level,
we
are
in
the
unique
position
where
the
sentencer
actually
knew
that.
so
we
have
a
very
large
insight
into
what
the
sentencer
would
have
done.
there's
no
--
it's
not
objectively
unreasonable
to
believe
the
sentencer
would
have
done,
again,
what
he
had
done
the
first
time
had
he
heard
similar
facts.
so,
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
cede
my
time
to
the
court.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
thank
you.
