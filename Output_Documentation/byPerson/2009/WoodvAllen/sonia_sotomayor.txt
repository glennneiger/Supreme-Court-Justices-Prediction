justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
take
you
back
to
justice
alito's
question?
as
i
read
the
lower
court
decision,
it
was
saying
counsel
made
a
strategic
choice
not
to
pursue
any
further
investigation
with
respect
to
mental
health,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
and
they
made
it
on
the
basis
of
a
number
of
factors,
including
the
fact
that
there
was
testimony
that
the
two
senior
attorneys
said:
it's
not
going
to
help
us
if
we
do
or
not.
you
may
disagree
with
whether
or
not
a
strategic
decision
was
made
or
not,
but
if
one
can
view
the
evidence
in
any
way
as
the
attorney
having
made
the
decision,
isn't
your
argument
that
that
decision
was
unreasonable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
that
what
justice
alito
asked
you?
that's
not
a
dispute
with
the
factual
finding
that
it
was
a
strategic
decision.
that's
a
dispute
with
the
legal
--
the
legal
--
whether
that
strategic
decision
met
the
legal
standard
of
strickland.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
we're
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
which
is,
isn't
that
a
(d)(1)
instead
of
a
(d)(2)
argument,
and
we
--
the
question
presented
only
addressed
the
strategic
decision.
it
didn't
address
or
present
the
question
of
the
strickland
question
of
whether
that
would
have
been
a
reasonable
strategic
decision.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
might
be
your
alternative
argument,
but
it's
not
the
question
presented.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
go
back
to
--
just
to
--
so
that
we're
on
the
same
page
in
my
own
mind,
what
constitutes
the
state
record?
because
one
of
the
state
amici
posited
situations
in
which
the
record
before
the
state
court
on
the
issue
that
it
made
its
determination
would
be
one
subset
of
evidence,
and
that,
perhaps
as
the
state
process
developed
on
another
issue
there
was
another
record
developed,
and
you're
pointing
to
that
evidence
in
your
argument
of
unreasonableness
as
a
reason
for
the
lower
court's
decision
being
wrong.
so
your
use
of
that
other
evidence,
does
that
go
under
(d)(2)
or
(d)(1)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
seem
--
does
that
seem
reasonable,
meaning
the
state
court
is
making
a
decision
based
on
what's
before
it.
can't
--
it
can't
foretell
unknown
evidence
and
bring
it
into
its
equation.
so
one
has
to
presume
that
its
finding
based
on
the
evidence
before
it
is
correct.
if
there's
additional
evidence,
whether
it's
part
of
a
record
that's
developed
elsewhere,
not
part
of
what
it
based
its
decision
on,
and
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
(d)(2),
it
talks
about
the
record
on
the
fact
determined.
it
doesn't
talk
about
on
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
you're
changing
your
earlier
answer
to
me?
you're
going
closer
to
what
the
amici
were
suggesting,
which
is
that
record
has
to
be
defined
narrowly,
it
has
to
be
the
facts
before
the
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that,
meaning
often
a
trial
court
is
presented
with
evidence
that
determines
something.
this
was
a
strategic
choice.
it
may
be
that
later
the
state
court
has
a
hearing
on
that
question,
but
it
may
be
that
it
has
a
hearing
on
a
different
question
altogether.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you're
using
the
evidence
on
the
other
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
don't
really
want
us
to
say
that,
because
unreasonable,
as
we've
defined
it
in
(d)(1),
means
it
could
be
wrong,
but
still
not
unreasonable.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
we
say
that
proof
of
a
--
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
a
decision
by
the
state
court
was
incorrect,
you
can't
equate
--
you
don't
really
want
us
equating
that
with
(d)(2),
do
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
why
he
--
that's
why
he
starting--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--from,
i
think
what
he's
saying
is,
what
your
adversary
responded
to
justice
ginsburg,
unreasonable
really
is
much
broader
than
clear
and
convincing--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--evidence
on
correctness.
you
don't
need
it
because
whether
the
decision
is
right
or
wrong
is
not
the
issue.
even
if
it's
wrong,
it
could
still
be
reasonably
wrong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
one
could
quarrel
with
that
proposition,
but
that's
the
state
of
the
law.
so,
why
do
you
need
(e)(1)?
that's
--
that's
justice
breyer's
question,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
work
it
out
in
theory,
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
work
it
out
in
theory.
there
are
--
you
see,
the
difficulty
with
this
case
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--one
factual
matter,
was
a
strategic
decision
made?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
are
a
bunch
of
subsidiary
facts
that
--
that
were
made.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you're
applying
(d)(2),
the
court
would
look
at
all
the
subsidiary
facts
and
decide
not
whether
they
were
correct
or
not,
but
whether
they
were
unreasonably
incorrect,
okay?
if
they
weren't
unreasonably
incorrect?
so
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
correctness
question
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
if
they're
--
if
they're
not
unreasonably
incorrect,
the
four
subsidiary
facts
would
then
support
the
fifth
general
question,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
either
we
agree
it
does
or
it
doesn't,
but
--
i
--
i
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
need
(e)(1)
because
you
never
need
to
get
to
the
correctness
of
the
finding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
stop
you
just
for
a
factual
clarification?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
the
defendant's
prior
history
with
his
other
girlfriend
come
into
the
penalty
stage
of
the
trial?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
this
was
a
wise
strategic
decision,
perhaps,
with
respect
to
the
penalty
phase?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
did
come
in
at
the
trial
--
at
the
sentencing
phase,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
front
of
the
jury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we're
not
arguing
about
the
penalty
phase.
the
issue
is
if
the
trial
judge
at
sentencing
did
hear
about
the
prior
assaulted
behavior
anyway,
what
would
have
been
the
strategic
decision
not
to
pursue
further
evaluations
because
they
--
there's
no
likelihood
in
my
mind
that
similar
assaultive
behavior
was
ever
going
to
be
kept
out
of
the
sentencing
phase.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
that's
one
of
the
strongest
aggravating
factors
that
you
could
prove,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
sentencing--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--jury.
not
the
penalty
phase?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
really
--
i
think
that
was
justice
stevens'
question,
which
was,
what
was
the
strategic
basis
of
a
decision
not
to
pursue
mental
health
information
when
everything
you
wanted
to
keep
out
of
the
penalty
phase
would
be
coming
at
the
sentencing
phase
anyway?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
entitle
as
an
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996
contains
two
provisions
governing
federal
court
review
of
state
court
factual
findings.
under
28
usc
section
2254
(d)(2),
a
federal
court
may
not
grant
a
state
petitioner's
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
unless
the
state
court's
adjudication
of
the
prisoner's
claim
“resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
based
on
an
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
state
court
proceeding.”
under
section
2254
(e)(1),
“a
determination
of
a
factual
issue
made
by
a
state
court
in
co-presumed
to
be
correct”
and
the
petitioner
has
the
quote
“burden
of
rebutting
the
presumption
of
correctness
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence."
in
this
case
petitioner
hollywood,
an
alabama
death
row
inmate,
brought
a
federal
habeas
petition
in
which
he
challenged
the
key
factual
determination
made
by
the
state
court
that
denied
the
application
for
post
conviction
relief.
the
state
court
had
found
that
the
failure
of
wood's
attorneys
to
pursue
and
present
mitigating
evidence
of
his
borderline
mental
retardation
was
a
strategic
decision
rather
than
a
negligent
omission.
the
federal
district
court
ruled
in
wood's
favor,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
concerning
the
relationship
between
section
2254(d)(2)
and
section
2254(e)(1)
and
to
consider
whether
the
state
court
reasonably
determined
that
wood's
counsel
made
a
strategic
decision
not
to
pursue
or
present
evidence
of
his
mental
deficiencies.
because
our
view
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
state
court's
factual
determination
does
not
turn
on
the
interplay
between
section
2254(d)(2)
and
2254(e)(1),
we
do
not
reach
that
question.
instead
we
assume
as
wood
would
have
us
hold
that
the
state
court's
factual
determination
should
be
reviewed
only
under
the
arguably
less
stringent
standard
of
section
2254(d)(2).
we
conclude
that
under
that
section,
the
state
court's
factual
findings
that
wood's
counsel
made
a
strategic
decision
not
to
pursue
or
present
evidence
of
wood's
mental
deficiencies
was
not
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
while
the
term
unreasonable
is
difficult
to
define.
a
state
court's
factual
determination
is
not
unreasonable
merely
because
the
federal
habeas
court
would
have
reached
a
different
conclusion
in
the
first
instance.
in
this
case
the
evidence
in
the
state
court
demonstrated
that
all
three
of
wood's
counsels
read
a
psychological
report
indicating
that
wood's
intellectual
functioning
was
borderline
and
decided
that
nothing
in
the
report
merited
further
investigation.
the
evidence
also
demonstrated
that
counsel
consciously
decided
not
to
introduce
the
report
to
the
jury.
this
evidence
can
fairly
be
read
to
support
the
state
court's
factual
determination
that
counsel's
failure
to
pursue
or
present
evidence
of
wood's
mental
deficiencies
was
not
mere
oversight
or
neglect,
but
was
instead
the
result
of
a
deliberate
strategy
to
focus
on
other
defenses.
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
we
express
no
view
as
to
whether
wood's
counsel
performed
efficiently
by
failing
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation
of
wood's
mental
deficiencies
before
deciding
not
to
pursue
or
present
such
evidence.
this
argument
is
not
fairly
included
in
the
questions
presented
and
we
therefore
do
not
address
it.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
joined.
