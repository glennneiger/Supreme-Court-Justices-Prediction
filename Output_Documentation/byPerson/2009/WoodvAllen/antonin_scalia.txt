of
course,
if
they
had
introduced
that
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
defendant,
there
would
have
come
in
the
report
they
had
gotten
from
--
who
was
it,
dr.
kirkland?
was
that
his
name?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
said
that,
although
he
--
he
indeed
was
in
the
lower
range
of
mental
agility,
this
did
not
affect
his
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
not
--
the
kirkland
report
was
not
a
favorable
report
for
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
didn't
just
say
borderline
intellectual
function.
it
went
on
to
say
that
did
not
affect
his
ability
to
perceive
that
he
was
--
he
was
doing
something
wrong
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
if
it
had
not
added
that
i
would
have
said,
oh,
yeah,
let's
--
let's
pursue
this
further.
but
they
--
it
seems
to
me
they
made
an
intelligent
decision
there
was
nothing
here
that
was
going
to
help
them
and
there
might
be
stuff
that
would
hurt
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
--
can
i
suggest
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
there's
any
--
any
contradiction
between
the
two.
(e)(1)
addresses
a
factual
finding.
(d)(2),
on
the
other
hand,
addresses
the
decision
of
the
court,
which
was
based
on,
sometimes,
just
one
factual
finding,
but,
sometimes,
many.
so
you
--
you
proceed,
first,
with
(e)(1),
and
you
--
you
ask
whether
each
factual
finding
on
which
the
decision
was
based
was
shown
by
the
defendant,
either
in
the
record,
or
if
--
if
you
have
an
additional
hearings,
by
new
evidence,
to
be
incorrect
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
you
do
that
fact-by-fact.
having
found,
let's
say,
two
of
the
five
facts.
to
fail
that
test,
you
then
go
up
to
(d)(2)
and
say,
okay,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
two
of
the
facts
--
in
light
of
the
fact
--
since
two
of
the
facts
that
the
court
relied
on
were
false,
was
the
decision
vitiated
by
that
reason,
or
was
it
nonetheless
a
reasonable
determination?
i
mean,
once
you
focus
on
the
fact
that
(e)(1)
applies
to
facts
and
(d)(2)
applies
to
the
decision,
it's
whether
the
decision
was
--
was
based
on
an
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
it
resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
based
on
an
unreasonable
determination
of
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
focuses
on
the
decision,
whether
the
decision
could
have
been
reached--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
the
use
of
any
facts
that
had
been
found
to
be
false.
