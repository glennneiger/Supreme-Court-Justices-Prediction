anthony
m.

you
don't
have
the
cite
for
542
f.
3d,
that
part
of
the
opinion?
it's
in
542
f.
3d,
1281,
but
i
don't
have
the
particular
page.
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
let's
just
talk
about
the
--
the
finding
of
--
by
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
strategic
reason
and
the
--
and
the
disagreement
with
that
in
the
federal
circuit,
and
let's
talk
about
it
just
under
(d)(1)
--
just
under
(d)(1).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
say
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
--
that
finding
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
--
is
that
another
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
--
why
is
"unreasonable
application"
different
from
"clearly
erroneous"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
(d)(1).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
beg
your
--
(d)(
2),
unreasonable
determination
of
facts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
--
you
think
there
can
be
findings
that
are
clearly
erroneous,
but
not
an
unreasonable
determination
of
facts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
(d)(2).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
problem,
as
justice
ginsburg
indicated,
is
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are
looking
for
guidance
as
--
as
to
when
we
can
go
into
--
into
these
findings
and
set
them
aside.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
really
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
wear
a
"clearly
erroneous"
hat
or
an
"unreasonable
determination
of
fact".
i
--
i
just
can't
sense
any
difference
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that
brings
us
to
the
point
of
beginning.
and
could
you
give
me,
in
summary
form,
your
best
interpretation
of
both
(d)
and
(e),
(d)(1),
(d)(2),
(e)(1),
in
light
of
the
deference
that
the
federal
courts
should
pay
to
state
determinations?
it
seems
to
me
that,
if
you
use
--
if
you
reserve
(e)(1)
for
cases
in
which
there's
a
hearing
in
the
district
court,
then
it's
somewhat
counterintuitive
because
the
strongest
standard
applies
to
the
accused.
he
has
the
greatest
burden,
when
the
state
hearing
was
the
least
effective.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
overlap,
there
--
then
(d)(2)
is
often
superfluous,
so
i
have
a
choice
of
something
that
is
counterintuitive
or
superfluous,
and
i
don't
know
which
one
to
take.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
--
but
maybe
there
is
--
is
some
more
general
theory
that
you
can
give
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
res
judicata
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
i
think
congress
might
have
had
something
like
that
in
mind.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
think
they've
been
handling
it.
i
think
there's
a
tremendous
confusion,
and
i
--
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
write
an
opinion
to
give
them
guidance
as
to
when
they
can
set
aside
hearings,
to
what
extent
they
have
to
review
the
entire
record.
to
me,
i
think
many
courts
of
appeals
and
district
of
--
and
district
courts
think
that
it's
just
like
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
it's
very
hard
to
--
to
use
these
standards
to
give
you
any
concrete
guidance
in
this
specific
case.
