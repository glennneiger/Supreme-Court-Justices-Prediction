when
did
that
come
up?
i
thought
that
the
facts
as
the
eleventh
circuit
presented
them
is
that
the
senior
lawyer
first
said:
we
want
dr.
kirkland's
report
not
simply
on
the
question
of
insanity
and
incompetence
to
stand
trial,
but
also
to
give
us
leads
to
mitigating
evidence.
so
mitigation
is
in
his
mind
about
looking
into
this
mental
question.
he
reads
kirkland's
report
and,
for
whatever
reason,
decides
this
isn't
worth
pursuing;
this
is
not
going
to
help
us.
i
thought
that
that's
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said
was
the
picture,
that
whether
it
was
an
incompetent,
ineffective
decision
is
a
separate
question,
but
as
to
what
happened,
why
did
the
investigation
stop,
because
the
senior
lawyer
said:
yes,
it's
relevant
to
mitigation,
but
i
looked
at
the
report
and
i
think
it's
not
wise
for
us
to
pursue
mitigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
that?
56?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry
that
i
don't
have
that
appendix
with
me
now,
but
as
i
recall
the
eleventh
circuit
was
not
making
any
independent
determination
of
its
own,
but
it
was
reporting
what
the
senior
lawyer
--
his
view
of
it.
they
were
not
making
a
fact-finding
as
a
tribunal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that,
what
you
said
so
far,
leaves
out
one
thing;
that
is,
i
thought
that
dozier
had
said:
we
need,
we
have
to
get
this
kirkland
report,
and
it's
of
interest
to
us
for
three
purposes,
the
two
that
were
relevant
to
the
guilt
phase
and
the
one,
mitigation,
that
was
relevant
to
the
penalty
phase.
that
suggests
that
in
his
mind,
in
dozier's
mind
from
the
start,
was
both
phases,
the
guilt
phase
and
with
respect
to
mitigation.
and
then
he
looked
in
the
report
and,
having
said,
we
should
see
if
there's
any
leads
to
mitigation,
then
he
next
says,
we're
not
going
forward
with
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
this
case,
for
me
at
least,
is
terribly
confusing,
because
i
thought,
reading
the
cert
position,
that
the
court
granted
cert
to
deal
with
a
legal
question
that
has
confused
the
lower
courts,
that
is,
what
is
the
relationship
between
(d)(2)
and
(e)(1)
of
aedpa?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
i
read
your
brief
and
i
hear
what
you're
saying
so
far.
it
seems
to
be
that
you
have
a
solid
case
under
(d)(1);
that
is,
that
these
counsel
were
ineffective
because
they
did
not
pursue
mental
state
mitigation.
but
that
would
be
a
much
different
--
that
would
be
a
fact-bound
case
tied
to
this
record,
as
apart
from
the
legal
question:
what
does
unreasonable
--
the
(d)(2)
unreasonableness,
how
does
it
relate
to
the
(e)(1)
presumed
correct,
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
i
thought
that
that
legal
question
was
why
we
granted
cert.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that's
--
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
position
developed
by
judge
kozinski.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
only
problem
with
that,
it
would
shrink
the
province
of
(e)(1)
very
considerably,
because
overwhelmingly
federal
habeas
petitioners
do
not
get
evidentiary
hearings
in
federal
court.
so,
if
we
accept
the
ninth
circuit's
view
of
it,
then
(e)
--
(e)(1)
applies
to
a
rather
small
category
of
cases;
i.e.,
cases
in
which
there
is
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
federal
habeas
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
about
(d)(2)
now.
we're
talking
about
two
provisions,
trying
to
make
sense
how
do
they
relate
to
each
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
very
well-presented
position
is
the
ninth
circuit's
in
judge
kozinski's
opinion.
my
only
question
is
am
i
right
to
say
that
his
view,
which
is
your
view,
would
leave
very
little
work
for
(e)(1)
to
do
if
(e)(1)
applies
only
when
there's
new
evidence
coming
in;
it's
not
just
the
--
the
record
that
was
made
in
the
state
court,
but
new
evidence
coming
in
in
the
federal
habeas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
not
--
not
many
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you're
saying
is
(d)(2)
is
a
vigorous
standard,
but,
yes,
your
description,
unlike
the
opposing
description
of
the
relationship
between
these
two--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
leave
for
(e)(1)
this
maybe
10
percent
of
the
cases,
not
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
--
i
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
just
want
--
i
just
described
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
i
didn't
say
it
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
that.
i
thought
that
your
--
your
position
in
this
case
or
at
least
one
of
your
positions
is
there
was
no
unreasonable
determination
of
fact.
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you're
right
about
that
then
you
win,
and
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
to
go
on
to
(e)(1),
that
this
case
in
your
view
should
be
totally
governed
by
(d)(2),
that
is,
the
determinations
of
fact
were
reasonable.
end
of
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
somebody
said
it
was
put
in
his
mouth,
the
question
was
on
cross-examination.
