justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
clarify
one
--
could
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
i
understand
that
you
can
understand
the
record
as
indicating
that
they
made
a
reasonable
strategic
decision
not
to
let
that
report
come
in
or
make
these
arguments
at
the
guilt
stage,
but
the
separate
question
is
whether,
did
they
also
decide,
make
the
same
decision
with
respect
to
the
penalty
phase?
and
if
they
did,
were
they
assuming
that
the
kirkland
report
would
become
a
part
of
the
record
at
the
penalty
stage
as
it
would
have
at
the
guilt
stage
if
it
came
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
a
question?
maybe
you
need
a
little
extra
time.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
what
is
your
view
of
what
the
unreasonable
determination
of
facts
was
in
this
case,
either
the
decision
not
to
go
forward
with
further
investigation
or
that
the
results
of
the
investigation
would
not
have
been
--
would
have
been
--
would
have
been
prejudicial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
because
i
am
trying
to
follow
this
here.
the
four
facts
you
have
described
would
--
would
support
a
conclusion
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
make
a
strategic
decision
not
to
use
the
report
at
the
guilt
phase
trial.
but
what
if
one
believes
that
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
not
to
pursue
the
investigation
and
--
and
--
and
to
find
out
more
facts
for
the
penalty
phase
trial,
and
the
--
the
--
the
state
court
said,
no,
those
facts
have
answered
the
case.
would
the
unreasonable
use
of
the
reasonable
facts
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
exactly
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
violate
(d)(1)
if
even
--
even
if
every
one
of
the
subsidiary
facts
was
correctly
filed
and
the
conclusion
drawn
by
the
court
was
also
correct,
that
it
was
a
reasonable
strategic
decision
at
the
guilt
phase
but
unreasonable
at
the
penalty
phase?
how
did
--
what
is
the
answer
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
also
has
to
involve
what
the
strategic
decision
was?
