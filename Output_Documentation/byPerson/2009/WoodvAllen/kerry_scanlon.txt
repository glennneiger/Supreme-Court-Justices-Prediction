mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
holly
wood
was
sentenced
to
death
after
his
lawyers
failed
to
investigate
or
present
to
the
jury
evidence
of
his
undisputed
mental
deficiencies.
that
evidence
was
readily
available
to
any
reasonably
competent
attorney,
and
it
offered
powerful
mitigation
which
had
a
reasonable
probability
of
changing
the
sentence
from
death
to
life
without
parole.
no
one
on
the
sentencing
jury
had
any
idea
that
mr.
wood
had
any
mental
deficiency,
much
less
that
he
had
an
iq
between
59
and
64,
which
means
he
ranks
in
the
lowest
one
percent
of
the
total
population.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
well--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--well,
the
kirkland
report
was
not
--
first
of
all,
was
only
about
his
mental
competency
and
whether
he
had
a
mental
disease
or
defect
that
prevented
him
from
knowing
right
from
wrong.
it
was
an
incompetency
and
insanity
report.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
atkins
and
other
cases
that
mentally
retarded
persons
often
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
and
are
competent
to
stand
trial.
what
that
report
did
have
is
a
very
strong
lead
that
he
had
a
borderline
intellectual
functioning.
that
is
different
from
whether
or
not
he
is
able
to
go
to
trial
or
whether
he--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--each
of
the
statements--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--justice
scalia,
everything
in
the
kirkland
report
that
talked
about
his
ability
was
his
ability
to
go
to
trial,
that
he
was
competent
and
that
he
knew
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong.
those
findings
in
the
kirkland
report
that
talk
about
that
relate
only
to
that
issue.
it's
an
entirely
different
issue,
which
the
courts
have
made
clear,
whether
someone
has
significant
mental
deficiencies
that
will
--
will
--
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
garners
sympathy
from
the
jury.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
justice
alito,
our
primary
argument
is
a
(d)(2)
argument,
and
that
is
that
there
was
no
strategic
decision
here,
that
in
fact
it
was
a
failure
to
investigate
in
violation
of
this
court.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
yes.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
well,
our
habeas
--
i
--
i
can
get
a
cite
for
that,
but
our
habeas
petition
was
all
about
failing
to
do
an
investigation
in
the
state
court's
findings
that
there
had
been
a
reasonable
investigation.
the
state
court
finding,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
at
page
201a
and
202a
of
the
petition
appendix.
and
at
that
point
the
state
courts
talk
about
eight
historical
facts
and
they
conclude
that
there
was
a
reasonable
investigation
of
the
facts.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
that
went
to
deficient
performance,
of
course.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
the
state
court
did
make
a
ruling
on
prejudice.
and
it
made
it
on
two
grounds:
it
found
that
he
was
not
mentally
retarded,
which,
of
course,
is
--
is
--
is
clearly
unreasonable,
because
you
don't
have
to
be
mentally
retarded
to
have
it
be
valuable
evidence
to
present
to
the
jury.
secondly,
they
--
they
found
that
the
crime
was
brutal
in
its
nature,
even
though
the
trial
court
had
--
had
--
had
declined
to
give
the
instruction
that
it
was
cruel
and
heinous.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
yes,
of
course,
and
i
think
we
can
do
that,
and
for
the
same
reason,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
was
not
reasonable
in
the
first
place
for
counsel
to
decide
to
stop
their
investigation.
that's
because
the
evidence
is
so
powerful.
this
is
the
most
powerful
kind
of
mitigating
evidence
you
can
have
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
correct.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
of
course.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
that's
correct.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
your
honor,
that
is
our
alternative
argument.
our
--
our
main
argument
is
a
(d)(2)
argument.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
no,
i'm
saying
the
fact
question
is
our
primary
argument.
that
is
how
we
lost
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
eleventh
circuit
made
a
determination
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
find
that
there
had
been
an
adequate
investigation
by
these
lawyers
of
a
mental
health
defense.
that's
what
the
eleventh
circuit
found.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
what
the
state
argues.
that
is
not
what
the
eleventh
circuit
found.
on
pages
56
and
57a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
eleventh
circuit
clearly
makes
a
finding
that
there
had
been
a
reasonable
investigation
done
of
this.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
page
56a
and
page
57a
of
the
petition
appendix,
which
is
the
eleventh
circuit
decision.
and
if
you
look
at
page
56a,
for
example,
the
eleventh
circuit
framed
the
issue
correctly.
they
say:
here
the
issue
becomes,
did
counsel,
before
deciding
not
to
present
evidence
of
wood's
borderline
intellectual
function
make
reasonable
investigation
or
a
reasonable
decision
that
made
particular
investigations
unnecessary?
and
they
go
on
right
after
that
on
page
56
and
57
to
say
that
they
did
a
reasonable
investigation.
they
cite
eight
historical
facts
about
that
investigation.
those
facts
are
objectively--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--with
all
due
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
if
you
look
at
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
at
this
critical
point,
there
is
no
reference
to
mr.
dozier,
who
is
the
senior
lawyer.
what
the
reference
is
to
are
the
state
court
findings,
which
they
say
at
57a
are
amply
supported
by
the
record.
those
findings
were
that
they
did
an
investigation,
that
it
was
adequate,
and
in
fact,
the
state
has
now
abandoned
that
position.
the
state
no
longer
claims
that
these
lawyers
did
any
investigation
at
all.
they
claim
that
they
looked
at
the
kirkland
report
and
made
a
decision
then
and
there
to
terminate
any
investigation,
and
that
--
that
of
course
would
be
a
violation
under
(d)(1).
but
you
first
have
to
get
to
the
fact
issue,
whether
they
did
an
investigation
in
the
first
place.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
the
f.
2d
cite.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
well,
i
think
your
question
is
--
is
right
on
point,
because
what
mr.
dozier
was
thinking
about
when
he
said
it
didn't
merit
further
inquiry
was
the
guilt
phase.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
that's
what
he
was
focused
on.
he
--
he
designated
to
mr.
trotter,
the
junior
lawyer,
the
penalty
phase,
and
therefore
the
fact
that
they
didn't
make
that
decision
is
clear,
because
two
months
later
mr.
dozier
himself
is
going
to
the
trial
court
with
mr.
trotter
and
asking
for
psychological
evaluations
and
other
reports.
mr.
trotter,
before
the
trial,
says:
your
honor,
we
have
not
investigated
this;
it
needs
further
assessment.
so
clearly--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
what
mr.
dozier
said
at
that
time
was
in
response
to
a
leading
question:
did
you
have
the
penalty
phase
in
mind?
and
he
said:
of
course.
now,
what
he
actually
did
when
he
requested
the
kirkland
report
was
to
limit
it
specifically
to
competency
and
insanity,
and
so
--
but
even
if
mr.
dozier
had
that
in
mind,
which
i
don't
think
the
record
supports
--
let's
assume
that
he
had
that
in
mind.
when
he
got
the
kirkland
report,
it's
obvious
the
state
agrees
with
it.
this
court's
precedents
show
that
what's
in
the
kirkland
report
is
an
extremely
strong
lead.
he
has
borderline
intellectual
functioning.
and
counsel
were
not
able
to
simply
not
follow
that
lead.
reasonable
counsel
would
have
seen
that
as
a
green
light,
not
a
red
light.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
right.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
and
that
is
very
central
to
this
case,
and
the
reason
it's
central
is
because
the
eleventh
circuit
got
it
wrong
when
they
focused
on
individual
fact-findings,
many
of
which
were
immaterial
to
the
claim,
instead
of
looking
at
the
entire
state
court
record,
and
so
we--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--right,
and,
if
you
look
at
eleventh
circuit's
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case,
what
they
did
is,
rather
than
look
at
the
entire
record
for
reasonableness
to
see
if
the
petitioner
had
shown
that
it
was
not
reasonable,
what
they
did
was
they
looked
at
individual
fact-findings.
and
--
and
they
said
that
those
are
not
rebutted
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence;
therefore,
it's
reasonable.
and
that's
the
mistake.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
okay.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
no.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
no.
i
think
the
standard
is
much
more
difficult
than
that.
i
think
the
standard--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--i
think
it's
--
i
think
something
could
be
incorrect,
but
it
wouldn't
be
unreasonable.
i
think
something
could
be
erroneous,
but
it
wouldn't
be
unreasonable.
i
think
that
congress
made
it
clear
that
(d)(2)
was
a
deferential
standard.
it
has
teeth
in
it.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
okay.
under
(d)(1)--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--right.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
right.
and
that
is
that
congress
said
that
a
petitioner
has
to
show,
before
they
can
go
anywhere
in
their
case,
that
that
is
objectively
unreasonable.
in
the
prior
version
of
this
statute,
it
was
much
easier--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--i
think
that
this
court,
certainly,
in
the
context
of
(d)(1)
has
said,
in
miller-el,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
something
being
erroneous
and
something
being
unreasonable.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
i
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
would
apply
there,
too.
i
think--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--right.
right.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
i
--
i
think
the
key
difference
is
this,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
that
when
you
have
a
(e)(1),
you're
not
looking
at
the
entire
factual
record.
you're
looking
at
independent
fact-findings.
and
that's
where
the
court
got
it
wrong
in
this
case.
and
what
this
court
needs
to
do
is
clarify
several
things.
one,
that
(e)(1)
does
not
mean
and
(d)(2)
does
not
mean
that
you
have
to
show
unreasonableness
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
that's
what
the
court
did
in
this
case,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
has
done
that
in
other
cases.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
correct.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
i
think
that's
right.
if
there's
different
evidence
that's
extrinsic
to
the
state
court
record,
that
is
looked
at
in
the
federal
evidentiary
proceeding
under--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--that--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--but,
justice
ginsburg,
(d)(2)
requires
just
as
much
deference,
we
believe,
because
of
the
--
the
need
to
show
that
it's
objectively
unreasonable,
so--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--right.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
there's--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--there's
less
--
there's
less
work
to
do,
of
course.
it's
ten
percent
of
the
cases
or
so,
but
no
deference
is
lost
because
(e)(1)
does
not
apply
to
the
other
90
percent
of
the
cases,
because
(d)(2),
that
standard
itself--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--right.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
and--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--the
other
evidence
--
if
it
--
if
it's
intrinsic
to
the
state
court
record,
then
it
would
be
looked
at
under
(d)(2),
and
the
petitioner
would
have
to
show
that,
looking
at
all
of
that
evidence,
the
determination
of
fact
was
objectively
unreasonable
only
if
the
evidence
is
outside
of
that.
and
--
and
i
think
we
agree,
it's
about
ten
percent
of
the
cases,
but
that's
not
insignificant
for
the
role
that
(e)(1)
plays.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
yes.
and
any
new
evidence
would
be
looked
at
under
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
whether
that--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--no.
i
--
i
understood
your
question
to
mean
that
the
facts
were
part
of
a
state
court
determination.
it
just
wasn't
the
first
one.
there
were
two
different
determinations,
but
they
were
both
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
right,
but--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--and
if
it's
within
the
state
court
record,
it
is
looked
at
under
(d)(2).
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
well,
those
are
both
unreasonable
determinations
of
fact.
the
first
one,
that
they
did
an
investigation,
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
ruled.
the
state
in
this
court
on
the
merits
brief
changed
its
position
and
no
longer
argues
that
they
did
an
investigation,
but
they
now
say:
we
made
a
decision
because
kirkland
report
was
a
red
light,
we
made
a
decision
not
to
go
forward.
that
is
also
unreasonable.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
well,
it
was
brought
--
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
under
(d)(2),
as
well,
because
the
central
focus
was
the
factual
allegation,
the
factual
findings
made
by
the
state
court.
that's
what
the
petition
was
based
on,
and
that's--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--but
there
were
--
there
was
language
about
unreasonable
application
--
unreasonable
determination
of
the
fact.
that
was
always
part
of
the
petition.
that's
what
was
focused
on.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
well,
i
think
the
focus
was
on
both.
and
these
cases,
they're
inextricably
linked
together
as
well,
because
these
determinations
of
whether
something
is
strategic
is
not
only
a
factual
determination,
but
it's
a
determination
that
has
legal
principles
under
strickland
and
wiggins
and
williams.
but
another
thing
i
would
like
to
say,
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
is
(d)(2)
should
never
be
made
superfluous
in
this,
because
that
is
the
primary
provision
in
this
statute.
it
calls
for
looking
at
the
entire
state
record.
it's
a
very
strong
deference
standard.
(e)(1)
has
its
application,
but
it
would
be
incredibly
complicated
for
this
court
to
tell
lower
courts
to
apply
(e)(1)
on
top
of
(e)(2).
and
justice
alito,
in
your
example,
the
problem
in
this
case
was
that
they
looked
at
subsidiary
facts;
half
of
them
were
immaterial
to
the
claim
completely.
and
then
the
state
court
jumped
from
the
fact
that
those
were
not
rebutted
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
deciding
immediately
that
everything
was
therefore
reasonable.
and
that's
why
the
courts
have
had
a
hard
time
with
this
standard,
is
aedpa
is
hard
enough
to
understand
as
it
is,
but
if
they
are
asked
to
put
in
a
correctness
standard
on
top
of
a
reasonableness
standard,
and
then
you've
got
the
difficulty
of
defining
what's
a
subsidiary
finding,
and
justice
scalia,
the
points
you
made,
it's
actually
very
difficult,
because
(e)(1)
focuses
on
the
determination
of
a
factual
issue.
(d)(2)
focuses
on
the
determination
of
the
facts.
it's
not
a
decision
in
(d)(2);
it's
the
determination
of
the
facts.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
right,
and
what
the
court--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--right.
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
right,
but
in
every
(d)(2)
case
this
court
has
considered
from
the
lower
courts,
what
they
focus
on
is
whether
it's
an
unreasonable
determination,
as
opposed
to
focusing
on
the
word
"decision".
and
i
think--
mr.
kerry
a.
scanlon
--yes,
there
is.
but
in
this
case,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
whatever
the
standard
the
court
adopts
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
clearly
made
its
case,
because
there
was
evidence.
they
never
did
any
investigation
when
they
had
this
strong
lead.
and
strickland
and
wiggins,
if
they
mean
anything,
means
that
you
have
to
make
an
informed
decision
after
an
investigation.
and
in
this
case
there
was
no
investigation.
they
now
concede
that,
and
there
was
no
reasonable
decision
made
that
the
investigation
should
be
limited.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
got
that
right.
they
simply
found
the
wrong
facts.
thank
you.
