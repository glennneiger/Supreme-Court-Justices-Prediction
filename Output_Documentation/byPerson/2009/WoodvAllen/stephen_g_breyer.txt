justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
have
it
right,
in
your
opinion,
so
far?
i'm
just
interested
in
the
relationship
between
(d)
and
(e),
and
as
i
read
it,
just
to
look
at
the
language,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
(d)
case,
we're
talking
about
something
that
was
decided
on
a
record
in
a
state
court.
and
you
--
you're
the
lawyer,
trying
to
get
the
federal
judge
to
say,
that's
all
wrong.
you're
going
to
say
their
facts
are
wrong,
their
fact-finding.
so
you
say:
judge,
that
was
unreasonable,
you
know,
in
light
of
the
record.
that's
what
you
do
under
(d)(2)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
(e)
is
a
different
situation.
(e)
is
a
situation
where,
for
some
reason
or
other
--
and
there
are
a
few
--
you
are
having
a
new
hearing
in
the
federal
court.
one
reason
for
having
such
a
hearing
could
be
that
there
was
a
factual
predicate
that
couldn't
have
been
discovered
and
it's
very
important.
so
you're
get
into
that
federal
court
hearing.
and
now,
when
you're
in
the
federal
court
hearing
it
turns
out
that
in
the
earlier
state
court
hearing
there
was
a
fact-finding
that
has
something
to
do
with
this.
it
may
be
not
so
important,
but
it's
over
there
and
you
want
to
get
the
judge
to
ignore
it.
so
there
you
have
to
show
what
(d)(2)
says.
you
have
the
burden
of
saying
that
that
was
an
unreasonable
fact-finding.
that's
what
it
says.
those
different
words
make
--
seem
sensible
to
me
because
the
proceeding
is
different,
and
the
way
we
talk
about
the
proceedings
is
a
little
bit
different.
but
as
a
practical
reality,
i
guess
they
come
to
about
the
same
thing.
all
right.
now,
forgetting
my
last
comment,
have
i
got
the
first
part
right
as
you
understand
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what's
an
example?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
think
of
any
--
give
me
an
example--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
you're
trying
to
proceed
under
(d)(2),
and
(e)(1)
is
somehow
relevant.
couldn't
think
of
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
you
just
look
at
them,
and
you
look
under
(d)(2),
and
you
say
this
is
an
unreasonable
determination
of
fact,
period.
there's
no
reason
to
go
into
(e)(1).
i
mean,
if
it
is
an
unreasonable
determination
of
fact,
he
wins.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
isn't,
you
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't
say
that.
what
it
says
in
(e)(1)
is
(e)(1)
is
talking
about
in
a
proceeding
instituted
by
an
application
by
a
person
in
custody,
the
factual
issue
is
presumed
correct.
but
if
you
fail
to
develop
--
you
know,
in
a
proceeding,
it's
presumed
correct.
you're
right
it
doesn't
say
it
literally.
but
i
can't
figure
out
an
application
for
it
unless
they're
talking
about
where
there
is
a
new
hearing.
otherwise
there
is
just
no
need
for
it,
it
is
just
repetitive
and
it
gets
people
mixed
up,
and
(d)(2)
does
all
the
work.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that,
i
see
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
possible
way
to
look
at
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
problem
i
see
with
that
--
now
i
see
why
it's
controverted,
but
the
problem
with
these
standards
of
review,
it
just
--
it
mixes
people
up,
and
it
sounds
as
if
you're
bringing
in
a
hammer
after
you've
brought
in
a
saw,
and
the
hammer
looks
a
little
tougher
than
the
saw,
and
--
but
why
get
into
all
this
business?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
have
one
here,
and
my
real
objection,
i
guess
--
and
it's
interesting,
i
now
see
the
conflict,
with
justice
alito's
clear
explanation
of
it.
and
i
--
i
suppose
the
--
the
thing
i
would
ask
you
then
is,
look,
my
objection
to
it,
hypothetically,
is
it's
too
complicated.
lawyers
have
enough
trouble
trying
to
figure
this
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
reason
we
need
to
interpret
it
that
way?
the
language
doesn't
have
to
be.
why
not
have
just
a
simple,
clear
thing?
if
--
if
they're
unreasonable,
the
state
loses,
and
if
they're
not
unreasonable,
the
state
wins.
da-da.
that's
too
simple.
but
why
not
use
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
why
would
we
not
soon
have
what
i
call
the
habeas
corpus
jurisprudence
of
what
is
a
subsidiary
and
what
is
a
major
fact
and
what
is
a
finding?
and
what's
wonderful
about
that
is
no
habeas
corpus
proceeding
will
ever
end
because,
throughout
the
country,
people
will
make
mistakes
about
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
subsidiary
and
the
subsidiary
to
the
subsidiary,
and
then
what
is
the
more
general,
and
pretty
soon,
we'll
have
all
--
everybody
will
be
arguing
about
that,
and
there
will
only
be
four
professors
in
the
country
who
understand
which
is
which,
and
they
will
each
say
different
things.
