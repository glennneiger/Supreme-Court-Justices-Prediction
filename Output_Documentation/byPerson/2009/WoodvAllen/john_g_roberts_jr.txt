we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-9156,
wood
v.
allen.
mr.
scanlon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
(d)(2)
raised
in
your
habeas
petition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
give
me
a
citation
for
that,
where
in
the
habeas
petition
you
made
a
(d)(2)
claim
as
opposed
to
a
(d)(1)
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
factual
determination
that
you
say
is
unreasonable
under
(d)(2),
that
went
to
deficient
performance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
the
--
did
the
state
court
make
a
ruling
on
prejudice
under
strickland?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
we
have
to
find
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
determination
both
with
respect
to
performance
and
with
respect
to
prejudice
to
get
you
through
the
(d)(2)
hurdle?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
maze.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
the
case
that
under
(d)(1)
or
(d)(2)
that's
a
threshold
determination,
and
once
you
get
over
that
(e)(1)
would
have
work
to
do
in
determining
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
under
--
you've
given
yourself
an
easier
case
because
you're
going
--
you're
getting
over
the
threshold
under
(d)(1).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
problem
is
(d)(2)
refers
to
determination
of
facts--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
asks
whether
it's
unreasonable.
(e)(1)
talks
about
facts
and
has
a
whole
different
test,
and
i
--
i
guess
the
difficulty
i've
had
is
--
is
reconciling
the
two.
to
the
extent
you
can
articulate
their
differences,
why
would
you
do
both?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
scanlon,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining,
but
i'll
give
you
more,
since
i
would
like
to
start
with
a
question.
my
first
question
was
whether
your
petition
was
under
(d)(2),
and
during
the
argument,
i
went
back
and
looked
at
the
petition.
and
i
see
the
exact
language
of
(d)(1)
quoted
in
paragraphs
45,
52,
58,
63,
71,
76,
82,
90,
94,
97,
and
104,
(d)(1),
and,
unless
i'm
missing
it,
nowhere
do
i
see
the
language
of
(d)(2).
i
see
the
language
of
(d)(2)
in
your
cert
petition
questions.
now,
i
think
there's
a
huge
difference
between
(d)(1)
and
(d)(2).
we've
been
talking
about
(d)(2)
in
a
case
that
was
only
brought
under
(d)(1).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
language
--
but
then
i
--
you
knew
to
quote
the
language
of
(d)(1).
you
did
it
--
i
think
it's
more
than
a
dozen
times.
you
never
quoted
the
language
of
(d)(2).
now,
going
back,
you
can
say,
well,
we
talk
about
these
facts
or
those
facts,
but
that
is
also
relevant
to
the
application
question
under
(d)(1).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yes,
i
find
it
hard
for
you
to
--
to
understand
how
you
can
say
it
was
focused
on
when
you
quote
(d)(1)
twelve
times
and
never
quote
(d)(2).
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
focus
was
on
(d)(1).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
a
(d)(1)
case
and
a
(d)(2)
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
08-9156,
wood
vs.
allen.
