justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
this
question
properly
before
us
in
this
case?
the
argument
that
you
seem
to
be
making,
and
it's
an
argument
to
which
you
devote
a
lot
of
your
brief,
seems
to
be
that
the
--
the
state
courts
unreasonably
applied
strickland
to
the
performance
of
the
attorneys
at
the
penalty
phase.
now,
that
is
a,
a
(d)(1)
argument,
2254(d)(1).
but
the
two
questions
on
which
cert
were
granted
have
to
do
with
findings
of
fact.
so
they
have
to
do
with
(d)(2)
and
(e)(1)
and
not
(d)(1)
at
all.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
an
entirely
different
question.
i
think
that's
the
question.
did
the
validity
of
the
--
the
conclusion
made
by
the
state
courts
that
there
was
a
strategic
decision
not
to
present
this
evidence
until
the
--
the
final
judge
stage
of
the
--
of
the
proceeding,
and
not
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
investigation
or
whether
they
--
there
was
reasonable
performance
overall
at
the
penalty
phase.
it's
purely
this
question
of
the
validity
of
a
finding
of
historical
fact
and
how
that
is
to
be
evaluated
under
--
under
(d),
under
(d)(2)
and
(e)(1).
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
an
example
involving
exactly
those
two
provisions
and
facts
very
similar
to
the
facts
here.
the
state
court
finds
that
a
strategic
decision
was
made,
and
that
raises
a
question
under
(d)(2):
was
the
state
court's
rejection
of
the
strickland
claim
the
result
of
a
decision
that
was
based
on
an
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
state
court
proceeding?
there
are
also
a
host
of
subsidiary
findings
of
historical
fact
because
the
attorneys
testify
and
documents
are
produced,
and
there
are
conflicts
in
the
testimony.
and
so
there's
a
question
of
did
--
did
dozier
and
ralph
talk
about
this
on
a
particular
day?
did
trotter
write
a
letter
to
so-and-so?
and
so
forth.
so
you've
got
all
these
subsidiary
--
all
these
findings
of
historical
fact,
and
they
are
to
be
reviewed
under
(e)(1),
under
the
plain
language
of
(e)(1).
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
then
after
they're
reviewed
under
the
plain
language
of
(e)(1),
you
turn
to
the
question
under
(d)(2),
which
is
whether
the
decision
about
whether
there
was
a
strategic
decision
was
based
on
--
based
on
an
unreasonable
determination
of
facts.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
there's
no
conflict.
