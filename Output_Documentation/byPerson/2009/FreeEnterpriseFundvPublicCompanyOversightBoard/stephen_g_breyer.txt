justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
don't
have
to
--
they
can't
issue
a
subpoena
without
the
board's
approval,
i
take
it
--
the
commission's
approval.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
commission
can't
change
the
sanctions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
can't
--
it
can't
pass
a
rule
saying,
we
don't
want
you
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
as
far
as
--
if
the
company
was
ever
certain
it
was
right
and
that
the
accounting
board
was
out
of
control,
completely
wrong,
the
company
would
just
say:
i'm
not
complying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine,
do
what
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
at
that
moment,
the
group
that
would
decide
whether
they
were
right
or
the
board
was
right
would
be
the
commission;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
you
don't
--
you
can
get
it
even
without
a
subpoena?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
or
i'll
take
your
word
for
it.
i'll
look
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
delay
you,
so
forget
it.
i'll
look
it
up
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i've
got
one
thing
on
my
list.
i'm
looking
to
what
they
control,
can't
control
--
the
commission.
and
so
far
i've
written
that
in
your
view
the
commission
can
investigate
people
without
subpoenas,
and
the
commission
can
do
nothing
about
it,
okay?
that's
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
two?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we
only
have
one
on
our
list.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
it's
good
or
bad.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
have
a
complete
list.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
have
a
statute
that
says
each
department
--
commerce,
justice
--
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
secretary
shall
appoint
an
inspector
general
who
will
in
fact
inspect
and
find
ethics
violations
and
that
office
--
he
cannot
be
removed
from
that
office
without
cause.
in
your
view,
that's
all
--
and
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
well,
why?
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
saying
that
the
--
the
chairman
of
the
sec
does
not
under
the
constitution
have
the
authority
or
the
sec
does
not
have
the
authority
to
appoint
individuals
who
cannot
be
removed
without
cause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
--
or
you
might
be
saying
they
do
not
have
the
authority
to
appoint
inferior
officers
of
the
united
states.
i
don't
know
why
they
wouldn't
have
that
authority
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
that
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
an
independent
agency?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
an
independent
agency?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
isn't
--
so
why
aren't
they
subject
to
the
president's
plenary
control?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
sec.
what
--
what
restrictions?
because,
interestingly
enough,
my
law
clerks
have
been
unable
to
find
any
statutory
provision
that
says
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
can
remove
an
sec
commissioner
only
for
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
silent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then,
in
other
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that
was
not
what
i
have
asked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
i'm
not
interested
in
that.
i'm
interested
in
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
answer
to
my
--
my
question
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
anything
in
the
law,
as
far
as
you
know,
any
statute,
that
says
that
the
president
cannot
remove
a
commissioner
or
the
chairman
of
the
sec
but
for
cause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
there
is
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
--
where
is
that?
would
you
refer
me
to
that
citation?
because
we
couldn't
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
agree
with
that,
but
i
mean,
you
do
agree.
i
thought
an
independent
agency
is
a
function
of
a
number
of
different
things:
where
it
is
on
the
chart,
what
people's
customs
have
grown
up
to,
expectations
about
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
the
president
might
expect
he
can
do
or
not.
but
all
those
things
are
not
what
i'd
call
hard
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
but
if
it's
not
hard
law,
then
i
wonder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
it's
not
what
i
have
the
answer
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
in
humphrey's
executor
there
was
no
provision
that
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
was
a
provision,
which
we
know,
that
said
the
president
cannot
remove
an
ftc
commissioner
but
for
cause.
have
i
been
wrong
on
that
all
those
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
render
the
board
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
an
executive
appointee
who
is
a
superior
officer
of
the
united
states
appoints
an
inferior
officer,
which
inferior
officer
can
be
removed
only
for
cause
--
i
mean,
my
goodness
--
i
can
--
there
are
lots
of
shapes
and
sizes.
i
can't
imagine
what
would
be
unconstitutional
about
that.
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
the
chairman
serve
as
a
chairman
for
a
fixed
term?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
therefore,
what
you
had
said
before
would
not
apply
to
the
chairman,
that
is
to
say:
the
president
can
remove
him
at
will--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
is
no
statute
to
the
contrary;
he
does
not
serve
for
a
fixed
term,
and
so
you
cannot
imply
that.
since
the
chairman
cannot--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
remove
him
at
will
--
you
do
not
have
what
you
would
call
the
gearing
into
play,
this
somewhat
mechanical
jurisprudence,
of
what's
an
independent
agency.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
saying
that
the
chairman,
not
the
commissioner,
is
the
person
who
does
the
appointing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
--
what
do
you
say
in
response
to
their
formal
argument
that
heads
of
departments
are
those
people
whom
the
president
has
at-will
control
over,
like
the
secretary
of
defense,
and
freytag
is
support
for
that.
and
these
aren't
those
people,
so
the
sec's
members
must
be
inferior
officers,
and
the
constitution
says
nothing
about
and
implicitly
forbids
inferior
officers
from
appointing
other
inferior
officers
beneath
them.
all
right,
that's
a
formal
argument,
but
i
got
that
out
of
their
briefs,
and
i
want
to
know
what
you
respond
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
i
--
so
we
have
to
take
the
dissent
there
as
opposed
to
taking
the
majority?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
reason
for
this?
having
read
this
enlightening
opinion
of
justice
scalia
in
freytag,
which
is
enlightening
to
me
if
i've
read
it
correctly,
i
would
say
that
the
question
--
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one
question
is:
what
is
a
department?
and
this
might
well
fit
within
that.
and
the
second
question,
which
is
separate
but
mixed
up
in
the
cases,
but
not
his,
is:
when
is
it
constitutional
for
congress
to
limit
the
president
in
his
ability
to
dismiss
a
--
an
officer
of
the
united
states
or
--
inferior
or
superior
--
for
cause?
and
--
and
what's
--
if
you
can
answer
it,
what
are
the
justifications
here
for
imposing
that
requirement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
interested
in
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
interested
in
--
i'm
developing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
court
today
announces
a
new
principle
of
constitutional
law
governing
the
structure
of
our
federal
government.
it
says
that
the
constitution
forbids
statutes
that
provide
a
inferior
officer
of
the
united
states
with
two
layers
of
removal
for
cause
protection.
where
does
this
constitutional
principle
come
from?
it
doesn’t
come
from
that
constitution's
text,
the
text
assignment
with
respect
to
the
power
of
removal
from
office.
it
doesn't
come
from
the
constitution’s
history,
for
that
shows
that
the
framers
disagreed
about
protecting
officers
from
removal
and
remove,
read
what
madison
says
about
it.
at
one
point
he
wants
to
keep
the
controller
totally
insulated,
at
another
point,
he
doesn't.
you
can
find
lots
of
that
history,
you
can't
find
agreement.
nor
does
it
come
from
this
court’s
earlier
precedent.
for
that
precedent
makes
absolutely
clear
that
the
constitution
does
permit
one
level
of
‘for
cause’
protection
and
it
nowhere
hints
or
suggests
the
two
levels
would
be
somehow
worse,
nor
can
i
find
any
constitutional
policy,
say
a
policy
related
to
the
separation
of
powers
could
somehow
offer
significant
support
for
the
majority's
brand
new
principal.
now
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
because
it's
a
little
complicated,
that
level
one
of
‘for
cause’
protects
the
scc
commissions
and
they
appoint
the
board
members
and
level
2
of
for
cause
protects
the
board
members,
okay?
i
understand
that
arithmetically
speaking,
arithmetic
two
levels
are
more
than
one
level,
i've
got
that
one
but
i
do
not
understand
why,
constitutionally
speaking.
that
fact
about
arithmetic
should
make
some
significant
difference.
let’s
consider
the
pure
logic.
how
does
two
levels
more
than
one
level
make
a
significant
practical
difference
to
the
president
of
the
united
states?
either,
the
commission
and
the
president
agree
about
removing
board
members
or
they
do
not?
if
they
agree
that
they
should
be
removed
or
they
shouldn’t,
level
1
makes
no
difference,
how
could
it
make
a
difference?
the
president
and
the
commissioners
agree.
now
if
they
disagree
and
if
the
commission
doesn't
want
to
remove
the
board
member,
level
2
makes
no
difference
because
the
commission
wouldn’t
remove
the
board
member
since
it
doesn't
want
to
level
2
or
not
level
2?
but
if
the
disagreement
is
different
and
it's
the
president
who
does
not
want
to
remove
the
board
members
but
the
commission
does,
level
two
helps
suppress
it,
because
level
two
stop
the
commission
from
doing
something
that
the
president
doesn't
want.
now
the
majority
underneath
those
general
statements
does
try
to
find
some
instances
where
the
two
levels
make
a
difference.
now
i
would
read
them
with
great
care
and
try
to
figure
out
just
what
they
are
and
if
you
do
figure
them
out,
i
think
you
may
agree
with
me
that
there
are
best
court
cases
that
are
not
likely
to
arise
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
of
it
never
has
arisen
in
the
history
of
united
states,
nor
in
the
second
level
for
cause
removal
limit
the
president's
policy
choices
beyond
what
level
1
does
because
the
statute
grants
the
commission
virtually
complete
control
over
every
action
the
board
takes.
the
sole
function,
i
think
that
second
level
of
fore-clause
provision
serves
is
to
assure
the
board
members
and
the
public
that
whether
the
commission
does
or
does
not
change
the
board's
policies,
the
board
members
themselves
are
protected
from
removal,
say
for
political
reasons
and
there
are
strong
justifications
for
granting
them
this
kind
of
protection.
the
board
carries
out
important
adjudicatory
functions,
its
members
act
like
judges,
when
they
hear
individual
cases,
for
example,
deciding
whether
and
how
to
discipline
and
an
accounting
firm
what
the
chief
justice
properly
mentioned
is
imposing
sanctions
on
affirm,
that’s
called
an
adjudication.
in
this
rationale
for
protection
here
is
reinforced
by
other
factors,
the
nature
of
the
accounting
board,
the
need
for
board
expertise,
they
need
to
assure
the
financial
markets
and
the
public
that
board
members
will
themselves
act
independently,
and
not
politically.
now
these
are
classical
reasons
particularly
adjudication,
for
saying
that
the
constitution
permits
for
-cause
protection.
so
i
can
conclude
from
that
the
presence
of
two
levels
of
constitutional
protection,
at
least
from
a
constitutional
protection
is
justified.
in
any
event,
for
the
reasons
i
said
i
don't
think
it
really
hurts
the
president's
authority
to
do
what
he
wants
in
any
practical
respect
having
a
second
level
rather
than
one.
and
i
don't
even
see
to
be
honest
while
the
court
reached
this
question,
do
we
really
have
two
levels
of
for-cause
protection?
the
scc
statute
says
nothing
about
removal
for-cause
and
if
you
look,
when
it
was
enacted,
it
enacted
at
a
time
when
congress
because
of
the
myers
case
and
before
humphrey's
executor
thought
they
didn’t
have
the
power
to
impose
for-cause
protection.
so
i
would
say
reading
it,
there
is
only
level
of
for-cause
protection.
so
the
court
has
to
read
an
otherwise
silent
statute
is
if
it
contained
a
provision
that
then
causes
the
court
to
strike
the
statute
down,
the
other
part
of
it.
this
seems
to
me
the
opposite
of
what
we
normally
do
which
is
to
read
statutes
to
whenever
possible
in
a
manner
that
allows
us
to
uphold
what
congress
has
done,
not
strike
it
down.
well,
with
the
matter
end
right
here
you
might
wonder,
although
it’s
sort
of
interesting.
why
would
i
dissent
orally
from
what
sounds
like
a
technical
constitutional
issue?
but
the
reason
i'm
doing
so
is
because
i
think
quite
a
lot
more
is
at
stake,
however
technical,
the
court's
decision
sounds,
i
think
it
could
have
seriously
adverse
impact
upon
the
functioning
of
the
federal
government.
in
announcing
its
new
principle,
the
court
as
you
heard,
says
well
there
may
be
all
reasons
out
there
that
limit
this,
maybe
it
just
for
the
accounting
board
normally,
judicial
opinions
are
not
tickets
for
one
ride
in
one
day
on
one
train,
they
have
principle
in
all
this.
maybe
it
can
be
limited,
the
courts
says
we
are
not
quite
saying
how,
but
unless
it
is
somehow
limited,
its
impact
will
reach
way
beyond
the
accounting
board,
potentially
bringing
within
its
scope
many
other
inferior
officers
protected
from
removal
by
a
double
layer
of
for-cause
requirements.
now
i
have
tried
to
count
them
and
the
government
didn't,
so
they
may
be
right
and
maybe
i'm
wrong.
but
we
made
a
serious
effort
over
months
to
count
them,
how
many
are
there
in
this
situation?
and
what
we
found
in
our
office
was
thousands
of
positions
arguably
occupied
by
a
person
who
seems
to
be
an
inferior
officer
of
the
united
states,
and
who
is
protected
by
two
levels
of
double
clause
including
for
example
high
level
administrators
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
federal
communications
commission,
the
chemical
safety
board,
the
federal
mine
safety
and
health
review
commission,
the
social
security
administration
and
including
as
well
1500
administrative
law
judges
and
including
might
be
surprised,
--
i
was
surprised
to
hear
this,
most
of
the
military's
officer
core,
they
all
have
two
levels
of
protection
and
they
are
all
officers
of
the
united
states.
so
what's
supposed
to
happen,
when
a
private
company
that
opposes
an
agency
decision,
attacks
the
constitutionality
of
that
decision
on
grounds
similar
to
the
ground
advanced
by
the
private
company
in
this
case?
the
majority
just
says,
well
this
may
be
really
different
but
maybe
it
is,
i
just
don’t
see
it
at
the
moment
and
i
wish
they
had,
well,
the
majority
does
not
explain
whether
or
how
these
positions
differ
from
most
of
the
county
board
members
before
us,
but
unless
today's
principle
of
constitutional
law
is
limited
in
some
way
or
other,
it
can
become
virulent,
running
like
a
computer
virus
throughout
the
holes
of
government.
i
cannot
know
for
certain
for
the
reasons
that
the
chief
justice
said,
just
what
the
adverse
consequences
of
today's
new
principles
will
be,
but
i
fear
and
i
have
grounds
for
fear,
that
they
may
be
substantial,
that
concern
helps
explain
why,
joined
by
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
sotomayor,
i
dissent.
