ms.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
resolution
of
this
case
follows
from
a
simple
syllogism,
and
it
is
this:
the
president
has
constitutionally
sufficient
control
over
the
sec;
the
sec
has
comprehensive
control
over
the
accounting
board;
therefore,
the
president
has
constitutionally
sufficient
control
over
the
accounting
board.
now,
mr.
carvin
has
suggested
that
there--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
--
i
think
not,
justice
scalia.
humphrey's
executor
said
70
years
ago
the
president
does
have
constitutionally
sufficient
control
over
the
sec
generally,
including
the
chair.
now,
the
sec
has
constitutionally
--
has
comprehensive
control
over
the
accounting
board.
there
is
nothing
that
the
accounting--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
--
the
chair
has
the
same
role
that
he
has
with
respect
to
pretty
much
everything
else
that
the
sec
does.
the
sec--
ms.
elena
kagan
--subject
to
the
control
--
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
commission.
so--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
in
fact,
the
commission
could
do
the
exact
same
thing
in
this
case.
the
commission
could
delegate
its
control
over
the
accounting
board
to
the
chair,
subject
to
the
control
of
the
commission
again.
so
i
think
that
there
is
no
difference
with
respect
to
the
sec's
supervision
of
the
board
than
there
is
with
respect
to
the
sec's
supervision
of
any
of
its
other
functions
or
any--
ms.
elena
kagan
--of
its
staff.
ms.
elena
kagan
the
sec
has
full
control
over
the
investigative
and
inspection
function
of
the
board.
this
was
what
mr.
carvin
--
was
the
one
thing
that
mr.
carvin
said
the
sec
lacked,
but
in
fact
it
does
not,
because
the
board's
investigations
and
the
board's
inspections
are
all
done
according
to
rule.
and
the
sec
in
a
number
of
ways
can
change
those
rules.
the
sec
can
reach
out
and
abrogate
any
board
rules,
including
rules
relating
to
inspections
and
investigations.
the
sec
also
has
power
to
promulgate
its
own
rules,
if--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
it's
certainly
part
of
congress's
control
mechanisms.
and
this,
too,
is
part
of
the
sec's
control
mechanisms
with
relation
to
the
accounting
board.
the
accounting
board
can
take
no--
ms.
elena
kagan
--and
i
think
that
the
sec
has
both.
it
certainly
has
the
authority
to
take
away
responsibility
from
the
accounting
board.
the
rescission
provision
in
7217
makes
that
completely
clear.
but
it
also
has
authority
to
set
the
ground
rules
by
which
the
accounting
board
does
anything
and
everything.
it
can
say
tomorrow
--
it
can
promulgate
a
rule
and
say
all
inspections
have
to
be
approved
by
us,
all
investigations--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
--
i
do
think
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
place
the
accounting
board
under
the
extremely
close
and
comprehensive
supervision
of
the
sec.
the
references
to
independence
that
one
finds
throughout
the
legislative
record
here
are
almost
all
references
to
independence
from
the
accounting
industry,
not
from
the
sec.
quite
to
the
contrary,
congress
made
it
clear--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
it
is
important,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
that
there
were
a
few
reasons.
first,
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
this
board
did
not
compete
with
the
sec's
own
resources.
members
of
congress
thought
that
the
sec
had
been
resource-strapped
and
wanted
to
create
something
with
its
own
separate
funding
stream,
which
it
was
able
to
do
by
declaring
this
a
kind
of
quasi-governmental
--
agency.
second,
it
wanted
to
get
the
board
outside
of
the
normal
civil
service
laws,
because
it
wanted
to
attract
people
that
it
thought
it
could
not
attract
on
normal
civil
service
salaries.
and
third,
i
think
history
and
tradition
have
a
great
role
in
--
in
the
question
that
you
are
answering,
because
what
--
the
history
and
tradition
of
sec
regulation
of
the
financial
industry
in
general
is
--
is
--
in
--
in
some
part
through
the
sros,
the
self-regulatory
organizations.
so--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
--
i
think
so.
i
think
it
would
have
been
harder
to
establish
a
separate
funding
stream
to
take
the
accounting
board
out
of
the
civil
service
when
the
rest
of
the
sec
is
subject
to
normal
congressional
appropriations
and
is
subject
to
basic
civil
service
laws
regarding
salary
and
so
forth.
so,
this
was
a
way
to
--
to
have
both.
and
it
was
also,
i
think--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
--
i
--
i
do
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
--
that
the
way
this
board
is
set
up,
the
statutory
scheme
and
structure,
makes
it
clear
that
the
sec
has
comprehensive
authority
not
just
over
the
rulemaking,
but
over
the
investigative
and
inspection
activities
of
the
board;
that
no
--
no
sanction
arising
from
an
investigation
can
be
issued
except
if
the
board
agrees;
that
no
inspection
report
can
be
issued
except
if
the
--
excuse
me
--
except
if
the
sec
agrees.
and
further,
as
i
said
before,
that
the
sec
can
reach
further
back
into
the
process
and
say,
not
only
do
we
have
this
kind
of
veto
authority
over
any
sanction
that
comes
out
of
an
investigation
or
over
any
report
that
comes
out
of
an
inspection,
but
we
can
also
change
the
way
those
inspections
and
investigations
are
conducted
in
the
first
place.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
for
--
for
--
for
public
companies
for
--
not
for
the
accounting
firms
in
general,
but
for
their
public
company
clients,
any
subpoena
would
have
to
come,
as
justice
ginsburg
rightly
said--
ms.
elena
kagan
--that
--
that's
correct.
and
--
and
certainly
public
companies
could
cooperate,
and
certainly
public
companies
have
cooperated
with
the
board--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
--
i
think
that
the
board
would
go
to
the
--
to
the
sec
for
a
subpoena,
ask
the
sec
for
a
subpoena,
and
the
sec
would
choose
whether
to
grant
that
subpoena
and
whether
to
allow
the
kind
of
investigation
that
the
board
wants.
ms.
elena
kagan
are
there
any
other
consequences
for
the
public
company?
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
--
i
--
i
believe
that
that's
the
case.
i
believe
that
it's
the
choice
of
the
public
company
whether
to
comply
or
not.
if
the
public
company
chooses
not
to
comply,
the
board
has
to
go
to
the
sec
and
to
get
a
subpoena.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
the
board
does
not
regulate
the
public
companies
themselves.
the
board
only
regulates
the
accounting
firms.
now,
the
accounting
firms
do,
as
a
condition
of
their
registration,
have
to
present
any
documents
that
the
--
the
--
the
board
wants.
and
so
the
accounting
companies
have
a
real
reason
to
comply
with
the
board's
requests.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
i
--
i
--
i
think
again
the
sec
could
change
any
of
the
rules
that
govern
inspections,
any
of
the
rules
that
govern
investigations.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think
that
--
that
the
relationship
between
the
sec
and
the
board
has
to
be
looked
at
as
a
whole.
and
it's
clear
that
the
sec
has
control
over
everything
that
the
board
does
or
could
have
control
over
everything
the
board
does.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
that's
exactly
right.
any
sanction,
any
final
inspection--
ms.
elena
kagan
--there
are
no
consequences
with
respect
to
the
failure
of
public
companies
--
not
the
accounting
firms,
but
public
companies
--
to
turn
over
documents
absent
a
subpoena,
which
the
sec
needs
to
issue.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think,
justice
alito,
the
president
has
the
exact
same
ability
that
the
president
has
with
respect
to
every
other
aspect
of
the
sec's
operations.
so,
the--
ms.
elena
kagan
--and--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
it's
the
commissioners
that
govern
all
aspects
of
the
sec's
operations.
the
chair
only
does
what
is
delegated
to
him
by
the
commission
or
--
either
--
or
through
the
reorganization
plans.
ms.
elena
kagan
excuse
me.
they
are
over
$500,000.
ms.
elena
kagan
subject
to
the
review
of
the
commission.
and
the
commission
has
been
active
in
this
area.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
he
does--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
he
does
everything
that
he
would
do
with
respect
to
any
other
sec
function,
is
that
he
or
some
member
of
his
staff
would
call
the
chair
or
would
call
other
commissioners
and
say:
i
have
a
problem
with
this.
ms.
elena
kagan
would
you
please
change
it
--
and
--
and--
[laughter]
--and
with
respect
to
that,
that's
exactly
what--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
scalia,
that's
humphrey's
executor.
humphrey's
executor
does
indeed
say
that
the
president
can't
order
the
sec
commissioners
in
the
same
way
that
he
might
be
able
to--
ms.
elena
kagan
--that's
a
70-year-old
precedent.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
--
i
understand
the
temptation
to
say
something
like,
well,
we
don't
really
much
like
humphrey's
executor,
but
we
are
stuck
with
it,
but
not
an
inch
further.
ms.
elena
kagan
but
--
but--
ms.
elena
kagan
--but
this
in--
ms.
elena
kagan
--but
two
points.
this
in
fact
does
not
go
an
inch
further,
and
it
doesn't
go
an
inch
further
because
of
the
sec's
comprehensive
control
over
the
board,
which
makes
the
board
function--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
removal
authority
of
the
sec
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
board
officers
is
a
for-cause
removal
limitation.
ms.
elena
kagan
let's
assume
that
that's
correct.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think--
ms.
elena
kagan
--mr.
chief
justice,
removal
is
just
a
tool.
removal
is
not
the
ultimate
constitutional
question.
the
ultimate
constitutional
question
is
the
level
of
presidential
control,
and
the
presidential
control
here
is
exactly
the
same
with
respect
to
the
board's
activities
as
it
is
with
respect
to
the
sec
staff's
activities--
ms.
elena
kagan
--but
that
for-cause
provision
is
surrounded
by
a
panoply
of
other
control
mechanisms--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
--
the
for-cause
provision
on
the
board
members
is
surrounded
by
a
panoply
of
other
control
mechanisms
which
function
as
a
complete
substitute,
which
give
the
sec--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
they
can
pass
a
rule
that
says
no,
you
can't
get
the
--
the
documents
of
company
x,
and
then
when
the
board
members
go
ahead
and
try
to
get
the
documents
of
company
x--
ms.
elena
kagan
--they
can
remove
them.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
think
that
they
effectively
can.
they
would
have
to
do
it
by
--
i
think
that
the
easiest,
quickest,
most
legally
secure
way
would
be
to
--
to
do
it
by
--
by
promulgating
a
rule
that
says
you
can't
do
this.
and
then--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
said
the
most
legally
secure
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
do
it
that
way.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
they
have
that
formal
mechanism
means
that
they
could
pick
up
the
phone
and
accomplish
the
exact
same
thing,
because--
ms.
elena
kagan
--the
president
can
pick
up
the
phone
and
fire
the
sec
commissioners
for
cause,
however
"cause"
has
been
defined.
ms.
elena
kagan
so
now
the
sec
has
given
the
board
one
order
and
the
president
doesn't
like
the
order
that
the
sec
has
given
to
the
board?
ms.
elena
kagan
again,
the
president
has
the
same
level
of
control
over
the
sec
as
he
has
with
respect
to
anything
else.
that's
just
humphrey's
executor.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
but
that's
humphrey's
executor.
humphrey's
executor
said
it
was
enough.
ms.
elena
kagan
and
the
question
is
whether
this
goes
any
further.
ms.
elena
kagan
you
always
have
to
rely
on
the
sec
to
do
anything,
to
supervise
anybody
in
its
field
of
operations,
whether
it's
the
sec's
own
staff
or
whether
it's
the
board
members,
who
stand
in
essentially
the
same
relationship
to
the
sec
commissioners
as
the
own
sec
staff
does.
ms.
elena
kagan
justice
alito,
i
think
it
all
depends.
i
mean,
we
are
not
saying
that
a
double
for-cause
provision
is
always
constitutional,
just
as
we
are
not
saying
that
a
single
for-cause
provision
is
always
constitutional.
the
question
is,
in
what
context
does
that
for-cause
provision
operate?
and
where
it
operates
in
a
context
like
this
one,
where
it
is
surrounded
by
a
panoply
of
alternative
and
--
and
equally
effective
control
mechanisms,
it
simply
should
not
matter
that
there's
another
for-cause
provision.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
justice
scalia,
who
doesn't
much
like
humphrey's
executor,
nevertheless
wrote
a
brilliant
opinion
in
freytag
saying
that
in
fact
independent
agencies
were
departments,
and
--
and
--
and
so
that
commissioners
of
the
sec
would
be
principal
officers,
their
appointees
would
be
inferior
officers,
if
--
if
those
appointees
were
subject
to
the
direction
and
supervision
of
the
principals
in
exactly
the
way
justice
scalia
said
was
necessary
in
the
edmond
case.
he
is--
ms.
elena
kagan
--no,
no,
no.
freytag
--
freytag
reserves
the
question--
ms.
elena
kagan
--whether
the
independent
agencies
were
departments
for
purposes
of
the
appointments
clause
and,
indeed,
in
reserving
that
question,
suggested
that
they
thought
that
the
independent
agencies,
so-called,
were
a
very
different
kind
of
creature
than
the
small,
specialized
units
such
as
the
tax
court.
so
i
think
that
the--
ms.
elena
kagan
--justice
kennedy,
the
conventional
understanding,
really,
ever
--
ever
since
humphrey's
executor,
is
that
sec
commissioners
are
subject
to
a
for-cause
removal
provision.
and
the
government--
ms.
elena
kagan
--i
think
that
--
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
i
think
that
the
--
the
implication
about--
ms.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
think
that
the
understanding
about
the
sec
commissioners
is
that
the
sec
commissioners
were,
essentially,
the
same
as
the
ftc
commissioners,
which,
under
--
which,
under
humphrey's,
were
removable
only
for
cause,
and
as
i
believe--
ms.
elena
kagan
--yes,
but
--
you're
exactly
right,
and
it's
a
--
it's
a
perplexity
of
this
law,
but
for
many,
many
decades,
everybody
has
assumed
that
the
sec
commissioners
are
subject
to
the
same
for-cause
removal
provision,
and
the
government
has
not
contested
that
in
this
case,
nor
has
mr.
carvin.
ms.
elena
kagan
no,
they're
not,
because
all
those
appointments
are
made
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
commission.
ms.
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
practice
in
this
regard
has
changed
in
different
administrations,
but
if
you
look
at
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
former
chairmen
of
the
sec,
they
make
clear
that
in
fact
the
commission
has
ultimate
authority
over
each
and
every
appointment.
ms.
elena
kagan
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
nobody
has
contested
that
question.
ms.
elena
kagan
and
we
are
not
contesting
the
question
that
the
sec
commissioners,
themselves,
are
removed
by
the
president
for
cause
under,
i
would
say,
a
very
broad
for-cause
provision,
in
the
way
that
bowsher
suggested,
not
something
that's
niggling
and
technical.
ms.
elena
kagan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
