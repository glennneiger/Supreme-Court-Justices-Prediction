mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sec
has
pervasive
authority
over
every
aspect
of
the
board's
operations.
board
rules
and
sanctions
have
no
effect,
except
as
the
sec
allows,
and
can
be
changed
by
the
sec
at
any
time.
board
inspections
and
investigations
are
subject
to
plenary
sec
control.
not
only
are
they
conducted
under
rules
that
the
sec
must
approve,
but
the
sec
can
threaten
or
actually
rescind
the
board's
enforcement
authority
any
time
it
thinks
that's
appropriate
in
the
public
interest.
it
controls
the
board's
budget
and
salaries,
and
it
can
reassign
matters
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--independent
of
the
congressional
appropriations
process,
not
independent
of
the
sec.
section
7219
is
clear
as
water
that
the
sec
controls
the
board
budget,
and
the
sec
in
fact
has
used
that
control
to
regulate
down
to
the
level
of
the
board
members'
salaries.
in
addition,
the
sec
can
impose
rules
requiring
getting
--
requiring
the
board,
for
example,
to
get
sec
pre-approval
for
particular
steps
or
particular
actions.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
in
fact,
this
board
doesn't
have
that
power,
because
it
can
only
do
so
as
the
sec
allows.
here,
as
in
all
other
contexts,
it
is
the
will
of
the
sec
that
controls--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
there's
a
bunch
of
other
similar
entities,
such
as
the
sipc
and
the
like,
that
assess
fees,
and
many
of
their
officers
are
appointed
by
department
heads,
rather
than
the
--
than
the
president.
and
so,
yes,
i
think
that's
actually
not
an
uncommon
feature,
but
the
most
--
but
the
most
critical
aspect
of
this
is,
here,
as
in
every
other
context,
it
is
the
judgment
and
the
decision
of
the
sec
that
controls.
the
board
can
propose,
but
it's
the
sec
that
decides.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
precisely
the
opposite.
with
respect
to
rules,
the
board's
rules
are
ineffective--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--and
the
sec
staff
can
do
precisely
the
same
thing.
in
fact,
right
now
they
can
issue
subpoenas
without
asking
the
commission
for
consent.
and
the
--
and
the
answer
is,
if
you
don't
like
it,
you
go
to
the
principal
officer,
and
you
say,
rescind
the
board's
authority
--
threaten
to
rescind
the
board's
authority;
this
is
out
of
line.
and
the
sec
has
broad
authority
in
the
public
interest
to
rescind
the
--
the
board's
authority
to
enforce
the
action,
enforce
the
law
in
any
respect--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
congress
would
have
to
do
that
by
legislation,
subject
to
veto
by
the
president,
and
in
fact
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
control
that
powerful
executives
regularly
exercise.
if
they
don't
like
the
way
an
inferior
is
doing
something,
they
can
take
away
that
authority,
and
they
can
take
away
their
salary
as
well,
which
is
so
close
to
being
fired
that
i
can't
see
any
light
between
them,
frankly,
your
honor.
so
the
board
--
the
sec
controls
whether
--
what
the
scope
of
the
board's
authority
is
and
its
salaries--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--and
it
can
issue
rules
requiring
start,
stop,
or
obey
my
commands.
and--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--oh--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--mr.
chief
justice,
of
course,
we
view
rescinding
an
officer's
authority
and
paycheck
as
being
exactly
like
rescinding
the
officer's
position,
but
if
you
are
going
to
look
at
formal
removal
authority,
that
exists
throughout
the
united
states
government.
there
are
1,100
administrative--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--1,100
administrative
law
judges,
right
now,
which
are
for-cause
removed
operating
in
independent
agencies
with
for-cause
removal
by
the
president.
there's
the
postal
service's
ig's
office,
with
1,100
employees
and
90
offices
nationwide,
removable
for
cause
by
an
entity
that
is
removable
for
cause.
we
list--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--if
the
--
if
the
response
from
the
agency
falled
out
--
falled
out
--
fell
outside
the
range
of
reasonable
policy
responses
the
agency
could
adopt,
then
that
might
amount
to
inefficiency,
neglect,
or
malfeasance.
and
the
sec
works--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
the
president
has
the
same
control
over
the
sec's
supervision
over
the
board
that
he
has
over
everything
else
that
falls
within
the
sec's
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
with--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--but
that
--
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--which
is
what
humphrey's
--
humphrey's
executor
held
up
--
held
up
--
upheld
that.
that
is
what
humphrey's
executor
upheld,
but
this
adds
nothing
to
humphrey's
executor
because
the
sec--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i'm
sorry.
i
believe
humphrey's
executor
was
that
he
couldn't
remove
the
--
the
officers--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--except
for
cause,
and
"for
cause"--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--is
traditionally
understood
to
be
inefficiency,
neglect,
or
malfeasance
in
office.
but
this
does
not
depart
at
all
from
that
standard,
because
the
president
has
the
same
control
over
the
sec
that
he
has
over
any
other
independent
agency,
and
the
sec
has
pervasive
control
over
the
board,
and
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
congress
can
give
the
sec
or
an
independent
agency--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--regulatory
authority,
but
not
the
ability
to
choose
its--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
our
position
is
the
same
as
the
solicitor
general's,
because
i
represent
inferior
officers
whose
positions
are
controlled
by
the
sec
who
are
principal
officers,
and
their
lawyer
is
the
solicitor
general.
so--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
position
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
to
have
is
that
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
sec
is
that
it
is
an
independent
agency.
but--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
don't
think
he
would
be
able
to
enforce
that
in
--
by
removal,
except--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--justice
scalia,
the
treasury
department--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--works
closely
with
the
sec
and
tells
the
sec
precisely
what
it
thinks
the
sec
should
do
on
a
regular
basis,
but
the
difference
is
the
sec
turns
around
and
can
tell
the
board
exactly
what
it
wants
the
board
to
do
and
back
it
up
by
taking
away
their
salaries,
threatening
to
rescind
the
enforcement
authority,
announcing
rules
that
say
you
may
start,
stop,
alter
investigations
upon
our
direction
or
the
direction
of
the
chief
accountant.
the
control
of
the
sec
over
the
board
is
plenary.
this
court
vindicated--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
it
issues
recommendations,
for
example,
on
how
it
wants
the
sec
to
handle,
for
example,
international
aspects.
one
of
the
issues
brought
up
here
was
the
sec's
handling
of
international
things,
and
that's
something
that
the
sec
--
its
international
bureau
coordinates
over--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--pardon.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it's
one
--
this
is
one
executive
branch,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--and
they
work
closely
together--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--and
i
can't
tell
you
exactly
how
they
work,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
--
i
do
believe
that
--
that
other
agencies
do
butt
in
all
the
time,
and
the
question
is--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--what's
the
control?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
the
first
half
is,
what's
a
department?
and
the
answer--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--okay.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
justifications
for
the
limitations
on
the
removal
of
the
officers
of
the
board?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
that
these
are
the
standard
limitations
--
the
standard
removal
provisions
that
exist
throughout
the
financial
area
where
the
sec
has
a
subordinate
entity
under
its
control,
and
congress
presumed
that
because
the
sec's
--
the
sec's
control
was
so
pervasive,
it
didn't
need
to
go
back
and
revisit
those
standard
removal
provisions,
because
--
precisely
because
--
the
sec
has
power
to
rescind
the
board's
enforcement
authority,
establish
rules
requiring
it
to
obey
commands,
disobedience
of
which
would
be
grounds
for
removal,
to
withdraw
the
salaries.
the
control
is
so
pervasive
that
these
removal
provisions
did
not
have
to
be
reconsidered.
and
from
the
board's
perspective,
they're
just
another
means
of
control,
one
that
actually
taints
them,
as
shurtleff
points
out,
with
having
committed
misconduct.
thank
you,
your
honor.
