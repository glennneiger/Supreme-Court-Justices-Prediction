mr.
michael
a.
carvin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
board
is
unique
among
federal
regulatory
agencies
in
that
the
president
can
neither
appoint
nor
remove
its
members,
nor
does
he
have
any
ability
to
designate
the
chairman
or
review
the
work
product,
so
he
is
stripped
of
the
traditional
means
of
control
that
he
has
over
the
traditional
independent
agencies.
on
the
other
side
of
the
balancing
test,
congress
provided
no
reason
for
stripping
him
of
these
traditional
means
of
control.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
justice
ginsburg,
by
making
it
public,
it
made
it
free
of
the
accounting
profession.
so
then
the
next
question
is:
why
didn't
they
have
the
same
relationship
between
this
agency
and
the
president
that
the
fcc
and
sec
have?
and,
in
those
instances,
the
president
can
appoint
and
remove
the
members.
now,
why
didn't
they
do
that
here?
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
there
was--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--there
is
a
buffer
between
the
president
and
the
board,
and
that's
called
the
sec,
and
the
board
can
do
many
things
without
the
approval
of
the
sec.
most
notably,
it
can
conduct
inspections
and
investigations.
there
is
no
statutory--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it
actually
can
collect
information
from
anyone
associated
with
the
people
they
regulate,
the
auditing
committees.
if
it
seeks
to
get
a
subpoena
from
someone
outside
--
if
it
seeks
information
from
someone
outside--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it
cannot,
for
example,
stop
what
happened
to
the
petitioners
here.
there
is
no
mechanism
in
the
statute,
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form,
for
the
sec
to
stop
an
inspection
or
investigation
as
it
is
ongoing.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no,
no,
and
i'm
dealing
with
the
inspections
issue
at
large,
not
for
--
for
petitioner
or
for
anyone
else,
there
is
no
mechanism
--
no
existing
mechanism
for
the
sec,
in
any
way,
to
say
stop
the
investigation.
equally
important--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
it
couldn't,
and
--
but
i
think
the
main
point
is,
your
honor,
it
hasn't,
and
since
it
hasn't,
it
doesn't
have
that
authority
now.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
but
i
can
tell
you--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
and
right
now
it
cannot,
and
that's
because--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
it
cannot
issue
such
a
rule.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
absolutely
not.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
the
provision
they
point
to,
7217(d)(1),
says
it
can
relieve
the
board
of
responsibility,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
gives
the
sec
to
conduct
the
board's
statutory
duties.
for
example,
it
couldn't
say,
we
will
now
collect
the
fees
that
are
going
to
the
board,
we
will
now
conduct
the
registration
that's
going
to
the
board.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
but
that--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
it
can't.
but
even
if
it
could,
my
major
point
is
it
can't--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--all
right.
if
you
turn
to
39
and
40a
of
the
board's
appendix,
at
the
back
of
the
red
brief,
the
board's
brief,
it
walks
you
through
the
statutes
we
have
been
talking
about.
and
at
the
bottom
of
39a,
that's
7217(d)(1),
and
that's
where
it
says
it
can
relieve
the
board
of
responsibilities.
and
i
have
two
points
on
that.
one
is
there's
nothing
in
here
that
gives
the
sec
the
power
to
assume
the
responsibility.
it
simply
says
the
board
need
not
comply
with
that
obligation.
my
second
point
is:
this
doesn't
stop
the
board
from
doing
something.
if
i
relieve
my
associate
of
the
responsibility
to
give
me
a
brief
tomorrow,
i
haven't
told
him
he
can't
do
it.
if
i
want
to
impose
a
limitation
on
him,
if
i
want
to
say
stop,
i
have
to
enclose
a
limitation.
and
if
you
will
turn
to
the
very
next
page--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--you
know,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--if
you
viewed
it
in
isolation,
that
would
be
an
arguable
principle.
but
if
you
turn
to
the
next
page,
40a,
you
see
a
very
specific
provision
in
the
statute
that
talks
about
how
they
can
impose
limitations
on
the
board.
and
this
is
when
they
want
to
censure
--
impose
limitations
upon
the
activities,
functions,
and
operations
of
the
board.
and
what
do
they
need
to
do?
they
have
to
have
a
hearing
that
the
board
has
violated
or
is
unable
to
comply
with
any
provision
of
this
act
or
without
reasonable
justification
or
excuse.
so
congress
has
established
very
serious
barriers
to
the
sec
even
limiting
the
board's
responsibilities.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
they
have
very
serious
information-gathering
powers
totally
distinct
from
the
board.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
any
--
any
person
who
is
a
registered
association
or
anyone
who
is
associated
with
them
has
to
provide
documents,
witness
testimony,
wholly
apart
from
a
subpoena,
so
anyone
who
is
within
the
regulatory--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--or
they
will
suffer
the
sanctions
that
are
listed
in
the
statute.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
not
--
obviously
the
commission
can
review
the
sanctions.
but
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
sanctions
of
course
are
done
with
order.
they
get
to
review
the
sanctions
after
the
board
has
done
it.
i'm
talk
about
the
prosecutorial,
investigative
techniques--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well
--
but--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--but--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
i
don't
think
there
ever
would
be
a
dispute
about
whether
or
not
they
would
have
access
to
their
documents
and
their
testimony,
because
it's
written
right
in
the
statute--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
absolutely.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i
think--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i
think
there
are
certain
confidentiality
restrictions
as
part
of
their
investigative
and
inspection
thing.
it's
--
it's
the
normal
kind
of
inspection,
where
you
go
through
the
investigation
and
they
would
review
the
various
documents.
and
my
--
but
my
basic
point
is
that
that
is
a
very
serious
burden
on
american
citizens.
that
is
something
that
is
totally
outside
the
sec's
control.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
that
would
be
one.
number
two
--
and
i
think
probably
more
important
--
since
the
sec
doesn't
review
it,
this
board
was
created
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
more
enrons.
so
let's
look
at
it
from
the
other
perspective.
let's
say
the
board
was
negligent
or
sloppy
in
ferreting
out
the
kind
of
auditing
standards
and
abuses
that
the
statute
was
enacted
to
do.
the
sec
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that,
no
way
of--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
you're
right,
your
honor.
the
burden
here
is
the
burden
that
mr.
olson
suffered
in
morrison
v.
olson.
he
was
never
indicted.
there
was
never
any
sanctions
subject
to
review.
but
he
was
subject
to
a
burdensome
investigation
and
that
is
the
burden
that
affects
american
citizens
that
is
beyond
the
review
of
the
sec.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
i
think
that
that
is
the
main
point.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--if
i
might
elaborate
slightly,
justice
breyer,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
they
have
the
ability
to
inspect
foreign
auditing
firms,
and
the
cato
institute
filed
a
brief
that
described
the
adverse
reaction
of
the
27
countries
where
they
are
currently
exercising
this
inspection
power
abroad.
that
is
totally
beyond
the
control
of
the
president,
obviously,
as
well
as
the
sec,
to
say
how
these
--
how
these
inspections
and
investigations
are
going.
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--again,
they
can
pass
rules,
but
the
attorney
general--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--there
are
three
fundamental
differences,
justice--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--in
your
hypothetical,
the
principal
has
exactly
the
same
powers
as
the
subordinate.
here
the
subordinate
has
statutory
duties
and
responsibilities
totally
distinct
from
what
the
sec
can
do.
in
addition
to
inspections,
they
can--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
obviously
they
do.
and
what
i'm
--
you
were
asking
for
--
i'm
now
trying
to
describe
the
relationship
between
the
sec
and
the
board,
and
the
one
difference
between
the
normal
employer
--
employee
relationship
is
that
the
board
has
statutory
authority
wholly
distinct
from
the
principal.
number
two,
if
that
subordinate
didn't
do
things
the
way
the
principal
wanted
in
the
employment
situation,
the
principal
could
fire
the
subordinate.
when
can
the
sec
fire
the
board
in
these
circumstances?
only
when
they
have
committed
gross
abuses
and
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no,
no.
in
the
interior
department,
those
are
of
course
the
president's
alter
egos--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
two
differences.
one
is
the
--
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
the
president's
alter
ego,
and
so,
therefore,
the
president--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
i
think
there
is
two
points.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
because
freytag
made
it
clear
that
there's
a
difference
between
an
independent
agency,
like
the
tax
court.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
in
that
case
was
an
independent
agency
in
the
executive
branch--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--one
that
is
not
subject
to
the
president's
plenary
control.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
because
of
humphrey's
executor
and
because
of
the
removal
provisions,
which
pose
very
serious
removal
restrictions
on
the
president's
ability
to
control
the
sec.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
it
is
silent,
and
--
but
it
still--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--they
have
not
taken
that
position.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i
know.
they
haven't
taken--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
there
is--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
it's
--
they're
given
5-year
terms,
so
obviously
if
you
have
a
term
of
5
years,
there
is
no
removal
provision.
under
this
court's
precedent
in
wiener,
if
there
is
a
term,
you
need
to
look
at
the
function
of
the
agency.
there
was
no
removal
restriction
in
wiener.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
court--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
with
--
pursuant
--
yes,
for
cause,
but--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--and
the
reason
we--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--the
reason
we
infer
ftc,
and
under
wiener,
you
need
to
look
at
function
of
the
agency
to
determine
the
president's
removal
authority,
and--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--not
under
humphrey's
executor,
which
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
president
had
no--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
and
i
will--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it
may
not
be
hard
law,
but--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
if
your
honor
wants
to
infer
at-will
removal
of
the
sec,
that
would
be
effectively
overruling
humphrey's
executor.
and
if
you
want
to
make
a--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
you've
been
entirely
right,
but
humphrey's
executor
didn't
focus
on
the
removal
provision.
it
said
that
that
removal
provision
was
constitutional,
and
the
reason
it
was
constitutional
was
because
you
could
make
executive
actors
separate
from
the
chief
executive.
the
sec,
like
the
fcc,
has
always
been
lumped
in
with
the
ftc
in
terms
of
that.
if
this
court
wants
to
say
that
--
that
those
people
are
subject
to
the
president's
plenary--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i'm
not
going
to
stand
in
your
way,
because
that
would
obviously--
[laughter]
that
would
obviously
render
the
board
unconstitutional.
i
think
the
key
point
here--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
because--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
president
called
up
the
head
of
the
sec
and
said,
i
want
you
to
seek
sanctions
against
the
chairman
of
exxon,
under
the
traditional
understanding
of
humphrey's
executor
the
sec
commissioner
would
not
be
beholden
to
follow
the
president's
direction.
the
same
would
be
true
if
he
called
him
up
and
said,
fire
the
chairman
of
the
pcaob.
and
if
that
is
so,
then
the
president
has
no
ability
to
remove
somebody
exercising
a
very
important
executive
function,
and
unless
we
are
going
to
rewrite
what
has
been
generally
understood
as
the
independence
of
--
of
independent
agencies,
then
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
president's
ability
to
fire
an
inferior
officer
at
the
justice
department
and
fire
an
inferior
officer
at
the
independent
agency.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
and
in
terms
of
that
basic
argument,
he
cannot
control,
for
example,
the
appointment
of
the
board
members,
which
he
could
with
respect
to
officers
over
whom
he
exercises.
he
can't
tell
the
sec
whom
to
appoint
to
the
board.
and
in
terms
of
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
earlier,
i
don't
think
it's
a
statutory
principle
that
you
pretend--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--not
an
inferior
officer.
but,
of
course,
these
are
principal
officers
for
three
reasons--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--then
i
have
two
other
arguments,
your
honor.
one
is:
the
sec
cannot
be
a
department
under
freytag,
because
it
is
an
independent
agency
indistinguishable
from
the
tax
court.
and
--
and
what
the
freytag
majority
opinion
said
was,
if
you
are
unlike
a
cabinet
department
because
you
are
not
subject
to
political
oversight,
then--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--so
do
i.
i
want
to
take
an
opportunity
to
focus
on
the
real
point
of
freytag,
which
was
made
very
eloquently
in
the
freytag
dissenting
opinion,
which
was--
[laughter]
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
appointments
clause
is
designed
to
achieve
accountability,
and
even
when
you
are
not
talking
about
presidential
advice
and
consent
positions,
the
way
we
achieve
that
accountability
is
by
vesting
it,
in
the
words
of
the
dissenting
opinion,
in
"the
president's
direct
lieutenant".
and
that's
very
important
because
it
makes
the
president
accountable
for
those
positions,
and
it
also
makes
them
able
to
resist
congressional
encroachments.
and
this
scheme,
besides,
embodies
precisely
the
evil
that
was
condemned
by
every
member
of
the
court
in
freytag
and
in
edmond,
which
is
it
creates
an
unaccountable
system
where
a
multi-member
commission
beyond
the
president's
political
oversight
and
control
is
making
appointments.
not
one
elected
representative,
in
the
president
or
the
senate,
has
any
influence
who
--
over
the
people
appointed
to
this
board--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--that
would
be
true,
and--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
they
can't
appoint
inferior
officers.
now,
the
board
with
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--the
board
and
the
sec
say
they
are
not
inferior
officers,
because
they
do
not
under
freytag
have
any
specific
statutory
authorization.
they
are
not,
in
the
words
of
the
appointments
clause,
"established
by
law".
so
if
they
are--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
there
are
two
differences.
one
is,
for
those
lower-level
people
within
the
executive
departments,
they
have
specific
statutory
creation
of
those
offices,
the
solicitor
general
on
down.
there
is
no
statute
saying
that
anybody
below
the
commission
level
at
the
sec
has
any
job.
that's
totally
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission.
they
can
vest
them
with
whatever
authority
they
want
or
not.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no,
it
would
only
be
unlawful
if
they
were
inferior
officers.
and
if
the
board
is
correct
that
they
are
not
inferior
officers,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem
at
all
with
the
sec,
for
example,
appointing
a
general
counsel.
i
should--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
no.
employees,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
and
the
argument
for
them
being
employees
that
the
board
has
advanced
is
that
they're
--
that
they're--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--if
i
am
scaring
you,
i'm
not
doing
my
job--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--merely
employees.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
that's
my
other
point.
the
chairman
does,
and
so
if
you
accept
their
view
of
who
the
head
of
the
department
is,
which
is
the
commission--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--all
those
appointments
are
unconstitutional,
so
under
their
theory--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--since
the
chairman
didn't
appoint
any
--
the
general
counsel,
the
heads
of
any
of
the
departments,
all
of
them
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
not
as
chairman.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
he
just
has--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--not--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--but
this
statute
doesn't--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
he
can
remove
the
chairman
at
his
pleasure,
which
--
but
not
a
commissioner.
and
that's
our
whole
point.
that's
a
very
key
point.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
we
argue
that.
they
argue
the
opposite.
under
the
statute--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--the
commissioner
does
the
appointing.
and
that's
our
key
point.
because
the
president
exercises
such
extraordinary
control
over
the
chairman
and
therefore
is
able
to
control
the
sec
staff,
congress,
in
the
statute,
took
away
that
traditional
enforcement
mechanism.
all
of
the
sec
staff
you
were
referring
to
earlier,
justice
--
justice
ginsburg,
are
the
chairman's
alter
egos.
and
since
they
are
the
chairman's
alter
egos,
they
are
completely
constitutional.
and
congress,
again,
took
away
the
chairman's
powers,
which
was
a
way
of
limiting
the
president's
ability
to
control
the
board.
and
i
think
they
--
but
our
basic
observation--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
because
we
believe
they
are
principal
officers
for
three
reasons
under
edmond:
they
run
their
own
shop;
the
commission
has
no
control
over
the
officers
on
the
board,
since
it
can
only
remove
them
in
these
extraordinarily
narrow
situations;
and
as
we
have
discussed
at
length
before,
it
can
only
review
part
of
its
work
product,
whereas
the
appeals
court
judges
in
edmond,
all
of
their
work
product
was
subject
to
review.
and
i
think
the
removal
provision
is
particularly
important
here.
the
board
can
pursue
policies
that
the
sec
absolutely
abhors
and
thinks
are
completely
counterproductive,
but
under
this
extraordinarily
narrow
removal
provision--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
it
would
work
perfectly
if
the
board
was
an
independent,
autonomous
entity
that
was
not
subject
to
the
plenary
control
of
the
sec,
and
that's
exactly
how
the
senate
report
described
it.
no,
the
new
york
stock
exchange
works
perfectly
fine
even
though
the
sec
has
oversight
responsibility
over
the
new
york
stock
exchange
directly
analogous
to
the
oversight
responsibility
it
has
over
the
board.
and
so,
no,
it
would
work
perfectly
fine
if
you
followed
the
congressional
scheme,
which
was
an
agency
with
its
own
autonomy
and
power.
and
since
it
is
an
agency
that
has
its
own
revenue
sources,
its
own
statutory
authority,
it
has
to
be
an
agency
composed
of
principal
officers.
elsewise
very
powerful
agencies,
including
the
cia,
for
example,
would
be
considered
inferior
officers
simply
because
in
an
organizational
chain
they
report
to
some
others.
and
i
would
argue,
to
get
back
to
my
original
point,
justice
scalia,
that
that
would
absolutely
confound
the
accountability
that
the
framers
insisted
upon,
that
either
the
president
and
the
senate
or
a
direct
lieutenant
of
the
president
make
the
kinds
of
appointments
of
inferior
officers
and
that
the
important
officers
go
through
the
advice
and
consent
process.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
thank
you.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
first
thing
i'd
like
to
address
is
the
solicitor
general's
syllogism
that
because
the
president
can
control
the
sec,
somehow
he
can
control
those
whom
the
sec
regulates.
well,
the
new
york
stock
exchange
has
exactly
the
same
relationship
as
the
--
with
the
sec
as
does
the
board,
and
no
one
would
argue,
i
don't
think,
that
he
has
any
power
--
the
president,
that
is
--
to
direct
and
supervise
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
alito,
he
couldn't
complain
about
the
excessive
salary
of
mr.
grasso
at
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
i'd
also
like
to
knock
down
this
myth--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no,
that's
entirely
true,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
point
is
they
could
have
accomplished
all
that
and
made
the
board
members
appointed
and
removable
by
the
president,
if
--
if--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
i
--
no,
because
the
word
"approval",
as
earlier
colloquy
has
suggested,
is--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--the
president
needs
the
unfettered
ability
to
appoint
principal
officers,
not
to
have
some
subordinate
agency
tell
him
who
he
can
appoint.
that
would
be
a
severe
restriction,
far
greater,
for
example,
than
was
at
issue
in
public
citizen.
and
that's
essentially
my
point.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
they
can't
give
you
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
in
the
same
way
they
have
strong,
effective
oversight
of
the
communications
industry
and
what
the
ftc
does
and
the
sec.
just
follow
the
model
for
independent
agencies
that
has
been
used
for
over
a
hundred
years.
you
make
them
appointed
by
the
president,
removable
by
the
president,
and
the
president
gets
to
designate
the
chairman.
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--you
could
have
exactly
the
same
relationship
between
the
sec
and
this
agency,
which
i
think
is
not
under
the
wing
of
the
sec
now.
the
only
difference
is,
instead
of
having
the
commissioners
appoint
them
and
remove
them,
you'd
have
the
president
appoint
them
and
remove
them.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
so
why
have
they
created
any
independence
if
they
really
wanted
them
to
be
subordinate?
and
i
really
want
to
deal
with
that.
this
notion
that
they
could
pass
rules
to
govern
the
investigative
activities
of
the
board
is
a
myth.
the
attorney
general
in
morrison
had
the
ability
to
promulgate
rules
for
prosecution,
but
he
couldn't
tell
alexia
morrison
how
to
proceed
in
that
individual
case.
he
couldn't
say:
anything
she
does
with
respect
to
mr.
olsen,
i
need
to
pre-approve.
why?
because
the
independent
counsel,
under
that
statute,
had
the
prosecutorial
authority.
under
this
statute,
the
board
has
the
prosecutorial
authority,
and
everyone
knows
you
can't
govern
the
kind
of
manifold
decisions
that
prosecutors
need
to
make
through
some
kind
of
bulky
notice-and-comment
rulemaking.
and
that
is
why
it
is
utterly
mythical
to
pretend
that
they
have
this
power.
justice
scalia,
we
assume
that
people
exercise
the
powers
they
have,
removal
and
the
like.
we
don't
assume
that
they
exercise
powers
that
they
don't
have
simply
because
they
can
theoretically
get
it.
what
if
the
statute
said
the
sec--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--okay.
let's--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--that
they
have
powers
they
don't
have
simply
because
they
can
reach
out
and
get
it.
so
let's
assume
the
statute
here
said
the
sec
could
transfer
the
board's
powers
to
the
treasury
instead
of
the
sec.
would
we
assume
--
would
we
analyze
this
case
as
if
the
treasury
was
conducting
the
board's
powers
simply
because
the
sec
had
the
theoretical
ability
to
transfer
it?
this
court
has
emphasized
countless
times
that
you
analyze
separation
of
powers
cases
with
respect
to
the
practical
consequences,
as
mistretta
said
it;
as
plaut
said
it,
with
respect
to
bright
lines
and
high
walls;
and
as
airport
authority
said
it,
with
great
skepticism
of
congress's
subtle
encroachments.
you
don't
create
fictional
realities
which
allow
severe
usurpations
of
executive
authority
on
the
basis
of
fictional--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i
do
have--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--justice
ginsburg,
we
know
exactly
what
the
sec
and
the
solicitor
general
think
about
the
interrelationship
of
the
constitution
and
the
statute,
because
they
have
expressed
it
in
briefs
from
the
district
court
on
up.
i
am
saying
that
even
if
you
bend
over
backwards
to
give
them
this
power
under
the
statute,
what
you
can't
do
is
pretend
that
they
have
exercised
this
power
under
the
statute.
the
first
might
be
a
doctrine
of
statutory
construction.
the
second
is
deciding
separation
of
powers
cases
on
the
basis
of
a
fictional
world
that
doesn't
really
exist.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
give
congress
an
extraordinary
blueprint
for
using
the
board
as
a
model
for
each
and
every
executive
department.
what
would
stop
them
from
tomorrow;
from
transferring
the
transportation
and
labor
and
energy
departments
to
a
private
corporation
like
the
board,
and
creating
some
bipartisan
commission
that's
going
to
oversee
this
board
with
these
fictional
hypothetical
realities?
if
this
court
endorses
this
scheme,
they
have
literally
offered
no
limiting
principle
why
that
couldn't
be
applied
to
each
and
every
executive
function.
to
the
contrary,
they
have
emphasized
that
there
is
no
constitutional
distinction
between
alter
egos
and
these
independent
commissions,
and
they
have
sought
to
justify
this
scheme
on
the
basis
of
cases
involving
core
executive
functions,
perkins
and
morrison.
so,
again--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
i
don't
think
you
can
sever
that
provision
from
the
statute,
because
i
don't
--
i
think
you'd
be
rewriting
the
statute
and
re-striking
the
balance
that
congress
did.
moreover,
of
course,
it
wouldn't
solve
the
appointments
clause
problem
because,
again,
these
are
principal
officers
not
appointed
by
the
president,
and
even
if
they
are
inferior
officers,
the
sec
is
not
a
department.
so--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
no.
it
is
a
very
serious
--
yes,
it
is
on
my
view
absolutely
dispositive
of
why
the
statute
is
no
good.
i'm
saying
merely
fixing
that
will
not
fix
the
entire
statute,
because
in
addition
to
removal
problems,
we
have
very
serious
appointment
problems
under
the
appointments
clause--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--your
--
i'm
--
i'm
to
assume
that
the
appointments
clause
problem
--
if
they
are
inferior
officers,
again,
i
have
an
appointments
clause
problem,
because
they
are
appointed
by
somebody
who
is
not
department
head,
i.e.,
the
sec
commissioner.
do
you
want
me
to
take
that
out
and
assume
that
that's
okay
as
well?
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
okay.
so,
if
we
are
looking
at
it
strictly
from
a
separation
of
powers
perspective,
it
is
true
that
eliminating
the
for-cause
removal
provision
goes
a
long
way
towards
fixing
the
problem,
but
it
doesn't
go
all
the
way
and
for
one
reason,
which
is
we
think
the
sec
imposes
--
is
at
the
outermost
limits
of
constitutional
acceptability.
and
so,
unless
the
president
has
the
same
control
over
the
officers
that
he
has
over
the
sec,
it
would
not
be
good.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
principally
because
they
are
not
subject--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i'm
sorry.
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
just--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--they
are
not
subject
to
the
chairman's
control,
unlike
the
sec
general
counsel,
and
they
have
statutory
duties
entirely
distinct
from
the
commission.
unlike
the
sec
general
counsel.
