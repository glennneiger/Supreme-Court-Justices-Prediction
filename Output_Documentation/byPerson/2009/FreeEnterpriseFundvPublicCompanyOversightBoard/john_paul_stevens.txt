justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
--
one
narrow
question?
if
we
assume
that
the
members
of
the
board
are
inferior
officers,
and
if
we
--
do
--
would
you
agree
that
if
the
board
had
unrestricted
power
to
discharge
them
at
will,
the
statute
would
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
even
if
they
are
inferior
officers
and
the
other
conditions
have
been
met,
if
the
commission
had
unrestricted
power
of
removal,
the
statute
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
yes
is
what
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
sure.
