they
can't
pass
rules?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
--
what
is
the
difference
between
what
you
are
talking
about
and
an
employer
who
says:
look,
i
can't
stick
my
nose
in
every
bit
of
business
that
goes
on
in
my
office
because
that's
impossible;
otherwise
i'd
be
doing
all
the
work
and
i
just
humanly
can't.
i'm
delegating
to
you
the
responsibility
to
do
x,
y,
and
z
according
to
these
rules
of
conduct.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
scheme?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well
--
let's
break
down
each
part
of
your
argument,
please.
you
are
suggesting
that
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
particular
principal
or
agent
of
the
government
doesn't
have
certain
responsibilities?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
just--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
it
unconstitutional
for
the
president
not
to
be
able
to
appoint
an
inferior
officer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
we
don't
accept
your
characterization
of
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
because
the
statute
required
it.
