chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-861,
free
enterprise
fund
and
beckstead
and
watts
v.
the
public
company
accounting
oversight
board.
mr.
carvin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
brief.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
carvin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
kagan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
thought
the
employees
were
appointed
by
the
chairman,
not
by
the
commission.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
--
you
think
a
--
a
veto
power
is
the
same
as
an
original
--
original
power?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
say--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--let's
say
that
the
--
let's
say
that
the
board
issues
--
demands
documents
from
a
particular
company.
can
the
sec
direct
them
not
to
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
will
that
be
consistent
--
do
you
think
that
will
be
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress
in
establishing
the
pcaob?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
--
just
out
of
--
i
guess
maybe
it's
not
important,
but
why
did
the
--
why
did
congress
set
up
a
separate
board
if
it's
going
to
be
entirely
controlled
by
the
sec?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
we
get
--
before
you
get
too
far
into
that,
of
those
first
two
things,
is
there
any
reason
congress
couldn't
have
achieved
those
same
objectives
by
establishing
the
pcaob
as
a
division
within
the
sec?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
have
consequences
for
public
companies
subject
to
the
board
if
it
refuses
to
turn
over
documents
requested
by
this
--
this
board?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
know,
but
presumably
you
only
get
a
subpoena
when
people
don't
cooperate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
happens
if
they
don't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
there
any
other
--
are
there
any
consequences
from
the
company's
refusal
short
of
--
that
would
not
require
the
board
to
get
a
subpoena?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
absence
of
the
subpoena,
if
nothing
happens?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
--
does
it
have
a
consequence
as
a
practical
matter
for
the
company
if
it
doesn't
comply
with
a
request
from
this
board?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
are
in
fact
collateral
consequences
that
take
place
without
any
involvement
by
the
sec?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
had
a
statute
here
that
said,
look,
if
you
don't
comply
with
the
board's
request
for
documents,
your
authorities
will
be
suspended,
and
if
that
were
the
statute,
you
would
say,
well,
that's
okay,
because
the
sec
can
always
change
that
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
asked
you
whether
there
were
any
consequences
from
the
failure
of
the
company
to
turn
over
documents;
and
is
your
answer
that
there
are
no
consequences
whatever?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
that's
humphrey's
executor.
but
you
have
to
add
to
humphrey's
executor
perkins
and
morrison.
humphrey's
executor
says
you
can
limit
the
president's
removal
power.
that
doesn't
get
you
down
to
the
board.
you
have
to
also
say
the
principal
officers
--
there
can
be
limits
on
their
removal
authority
of
the
board
members.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
didn't
say
anything
bad
about
humphrey's
executor.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
i'm
sorry.
what
is
the
removal
authority
of
the
sec
with
respect
to
board
officers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
so
there
is
a
limitation
there.
for
cause
does
not
include
failure
to
follow
the
policies
of
the
president.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
need
to
rely
on
morrison
to
make
the
limitations
on
what
the
sec
can
do
with
respect
to
the
board
constitutional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
need
to
rely
on
humphrey's
executor
to
make
the
limitations
on
what
the
president
can
tell
the
sec
constitutional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no,
because
you
have
got
an
extra
layer
there.
let's
say,
i
mean,
that
you
have
to
have
two
violations
of
the
for-cause
provision.
you
have
got
to
have
--
you
have
to
meet
the
requirement
in
two
places.
when
the
sec
wants
to
remove
the
board
member,
they
can
only
do
that
for
cause.
and
if
they
decide,
well,
there
isn't
cause,
i'm
not
going
to
do
it,
then
the
president
under
your
theory
has
to
remove
the
sec
commissioners,
all
of
them,
not
just
--
not
just
the
chairman,
and
he
can
only
do
that
for
cause.
so
you
have
got
"for
cause"
squared,
and
that's
--
that's
a
significant
limitation
that
humphrey's
executor
didn't
recognize
and
morrison
didn't
recognize.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
one
are
we
talking
about,
the
first
one
or
the
second
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
just
talk
--
a
practical
example.
the
board
says
i
want
to
get
the
documents
of
company
x.
the
sec
thinks
they
shouldn't
do
that.
okay?
can
they
remove
them
for
that
situation
--
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
they
say--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
are
fired?
can
they
say,
you
are
fired
because
we
have
control
over
what
you
do
and
we
don't
think
you
should
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
easiest
way
to
do
it
is
to
pick
up
the
phone,
not
by
promulgating
a
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
the
president
pick
up
the
phone
and
fire
the
sec
commissioners?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
thinks
--
he
thinks
they
--
the
board
should
be
getting
the
documents
from
the
other
company,
and
the
sec
thinks
they
can't.
so
the
sec
tells
the
board,
don't
go
after
that
company,
and
because
they
do
that
the
president
fires
the
sec.
does
that
work
under
your
theory?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
worried
if
it's
the
same.
i'm
worried
if
it's
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
then--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
goes
further
because
you've
got
to
rely
on
the
sec
to
get
to
the
board.
so
there
you've
got
to
rely
on
perkins
and
morrison.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
they
have
to
say
about
the
theory
that
the
sec
commissioners
can
be
removed
by
the
president?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
are
not
contesting
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
lamken.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
--
so
you
disagree
with
general
kagan?
i
thought
she
said
one
of
the
reasons
for
taking
the
board
outside
the
sec
is
that
they'd
have
an
independent
funding
stream.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
board
can
act,
and
the
sec
can,
i
suppose,
retroactively
veto
their
actions,
but
the
sec
doesn't
propose
what
actions
the
board
takes,
actions
that
can
have
significant,
devastating
consequences
for
the
regulated
bodies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
talking
about
rules.
agencies
in
the
government
do
not
act
only
in
implementing
a
particular
rule.
they
have
authority
to
regulate.
and
the
board
here,
for
example,
can
tell
a
particular
entity:
you
have
to
turn
over
these
documents.
they
don't
have
to
have
a
rule
that
says,
this
company
must
turn
over
the
documents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
other--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
there
any
other
situation
in
the
vast
federal
bureaucracy,
where
you
have
this
two-level
situation
that
we
have
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
president
can't
remove
the
sec
commissioners
at
will.
they
can't
remove
the
pcaob
commissioners
at
will.
or
even
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
for-cause
perspective,
there
has
to
be
two
layers
of
"for
cause".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
well,
give
me
an
example.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
formulation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
formulation
--
excuse
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
formulation
that
you
use
and
your
friend
the
solicitor
general
have
used
--
has
used
is
that
they
have
the
same
authority
that
they
have
over
every
other
independent
agency,
but
i'm
--
it's
very
hard
to
find
out
exactly
what
that
authority
is.
so
what
is
your
position
about
the
authority
of
the
president?
is
it
more
than
for
cause
or
only
for
cause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
understand
that
position
to
be?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
president
--
i
guess
i'm
following
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question
--
the
president
cannot
call
them
and
say,
take
this
particular
action
in
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
carvin,
to
keep
the
time
even
here,
you
have
8
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
--
judge
kavanaugh
has
suggested
there
are
two
ways
to
cure
this
problem:
one,
have
the
president
appoint
and
remove;
and
the
other
thing,
make
it
truly
subordinate
to
the
sec.
now,
i've
heard
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
both
from
the
government
--
well,
it's
an
issue
with
the
government
--
the
solicitor
general
and
the
board,
that
the
agency,
the
board,
is
completely
subordinate
to
the
sec.
well,
if
congress
--
congress
could
fix
this
problem
by
saying:
the
board
is
subordinate
to
the
sec.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finally
this
term
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
08-861,
free
enterprise
fund
versus
public
company
accounting
oversight
board.
this
is
a
case
about
presidential
power
and
accountability.
we
learned
early
on
that
our
constitution
seeks
to
protect
liberty
by
separating
the
government’s
powers
in
to
three
branches,
legislate,
executive
and
judicial.
the
constitutional
vests
executive
power
in
the
president
and
makes
it
his
duty
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.
the
president
of
course,
cannot
executive
the
laws
by
himself,
rather
he
insures
the
faithfully
execution
of
the
laws
through
his
oversight
of
executive
officers.
the
issue
before
us
concerns
the
president’s
authority
to
remove
those
officers
when
he
determines
that
such
action
is
necessary
to
his
own
faithful
execution
of
the
laws.
the
case
arises
out
of
a
challenge
to
an
unusual
government
agency,
the
public
company
accounting
oversight
board.
the
congress
created
the
board
in
2002
to
regulate
the
accounting
business.
accounting
firms
that
audit
public
companies
must
register
with
the
board,
pay
it
fees
and
comply
with
its
rules
and
oversight.
the
board
inspects
firms,
conducts
formal
investigations
and
can
issue
severe
sections.
members
of
the
board
are
not
appointed
by
the
president
instead
they
are
appointed
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
an
independent
government
agency
over
which
the
president
has
little
direct
control.
the
president
appoints
commissioners
but
the
parties
agree
that
the
president
can
not
remove
them
at
will
but
only
for
good
cause.
a
legal
concept
that
in
this
context
does
not
include
disagreements
about
policy.
while
the
sec
appoints
board
members
it
in
turn
can
not
remove
them
at
will,
instead
the
sec
can
remove
board
members
only
for
good
cause
strictly
defined
in
this
instance
to
include
only
the
willful
violation
of
board
rules
or
the
securities
laws,
willful
abuse
of
office
or
unreasonable
failure
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
law
and
with
accounting
rules.
board
members
execute
the
laws
of
the
united
states
but
they
are
shielded
from
the
chief
executive
by
two
layers
of
insulation.
the
president
must
show
good
cause
to
fire
the
commissioners
and
the
commission
must
show
good
cause
to
fire
the
board.
now
this
suit
was
brought
by
an
accounting
firm,
beckstead
and
watts
and
a
nonprofit
group,
the
free
enterprise
fund,
they
argued
that
the
act
creating
the
board
violates
the
separation
of
powers
by
effectively
shielding
the
board
from
the
president's
control.
the
district
court
ruled
against
petitioners
and
a
divided
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
in
part,
we
hold
that
the
dual
for
cause
limitations
on
the
removal
of
board
members
contravene
the
constitution's
separation
of
powers.
the
president's
executive
power
includes
the
authority
to
keep
executive
officers
accountable
by
removing
them
from
office
if
necessary.
as
james
madison
stated
on
the
floor
of
the
first
congress
“if
any
power
whatsoever
is
in
its
nature
executive,
it
is
the
power
of
appointing
overseeing
and
controlling
those
who
execute
the
laws".
our
landmark
decision
in
myers
versus
united
states
almost
90
years
ago,
we
affirm
that
article
two
confers
on
the
president,
the
general
administrative
control
of
those
executing
the
laws.
it
is
his
responsibility
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.
as
we
explained
in
myers
he
must
therefore
have
the
power
to
remove
those
officers
for
whom
he
cannot
continue
to
be
responsible.
now
since
myers,
we
have
upheld
limited
restrictions
on
the
president's
removal
power,
most
prominently
in
a
case
called
humphrey's
executor
versus
united
states,
there
we
held
that
congress
may
under
certain
circumstances
create
independent
principal
officers
whom
the
president
cannot
remove
at
will
but
only
for
good
cause.
but
in
that
case
and
others
applying
similar
reasoning
only
one
level
of
protected
tenure
separated
the
president
from
an
officer
exercising
executive
power.
the
president
or
a
subordinate
he
could
remove
at
will
decide
it
whether
the
protected
officers
conduct
merited
removal
under
the
good
cause
standard.
in
this
case,
we
are
asked
to
consider
a
new
situation,
not
yet
encountered
by
the
court.
the
act
before
us
insulates
executive
officers,
officers
who
exercise
significant
power
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
behind
two
levels
of
good
cause
tenure,
it
not
only
protects
board
members
from
removal
except
for
good
cause
but
withdraws
from
the
president,
any
decision
on
which
on
whether
that
could
cause
exists.
that
decision
invested
in
other
tenured
officers,
to
commissioners
were
not
subject
to
the
president's
direct
control
and
who
cannot
be
fired
simply
because
the
president
disagrees
with
their
decision.
this
added
layer
of
protection
makes
a
fundamental
difference
with
only
one
layer
of
insulation,
the
commissioners
could
remove
board
members
at
will
and
would
have
no
excuse
for
retaining
an
officer
who
is
not
faithfully
executing
the
law,
they
would
be
responsible
for
everything
the
board
does
and
the
president
could
hold
them
accountable
to
the
same
extent
that
he
can
hold
them
accountable
for
all
the
commission's
other
functions
but
with
two
layers
of
insulation
in
place
the
president's
review
is
limited.
the
president
cannot
hold
the
commissioners
accountable
for
the
board's
conduct
because
the
commissioners
cannot
remove
the
board
at
will,
they
are
not
responsible
for
everything
the
board
does.
they
are
only
responsible
for
their
determination
of
whether
the
act’s
rigorous
would
cause
standard
is
met
and
even
if
the
president
disagrees
with
their
determination,
he
cannot
intervene
on
that
basis
alone.
this
arrangement
is
contrary
to
article
two’s
vesting
of
the
executive
power
in
the
president.
without
the
ability
to
oversee
the
board
or
to
attribute
the
board's
failings
to
those
whom
he
can
oversee,
the
president
is
no
longer
the
judge
of
the
board's
conduct.
he
does
not
decide
whether
board
members
are
abusing
their
officers
or
neglecting
their
duties.
he
cannot
ensure
that
the
laws
are
being
faithfully
executed
and
he
cannot
be
responsible
for
board
member’s
breach
of
faith.
that
consequence
undermines
the
principle
of
accountability
that
is
at
the
heart
of
our
democratic
republic.
after
all
none
of
us
get
to
vote
for
sec
commissioners
or
for
members
of
the
public
company
accounting
oversight
board,
instead
as
alexander
hamilton
explained
in
the
federalist
papers
the
people
look
to
the
president
to
guide
the
assistance
and
deputies
subject
to
his
superintendence,
without
a
clear
and
effective
chain
of
command
the
people
do
not
know,
again
as
hamilton
put
it
on
whom
the
blame
for
“a
pernicious
measure
or
a
series
of
pernicious
measures
ought
really
to
fall"
that
is
why
madison
insisted
that
the
chain
of
dependents
be
preserved,
that
the
lowest
officers,
the
middle
grade,
and
the
highest
will
depend
as
they
ought
on
the
president
and
the
president
on
the
community.
this
much
is
basic
for
the
people
to
govern
they
must
be
able
to
hold
an
elected
official
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
the
executive
branch,
that
official
is
under
the
constitution
the
president.
for
the
president
to
be
accountable,
he
must
have
the
power
to
control
the
executive
officers
who
assist
him
in
carrying
out
his
duties.
this
fundamental
principle
is
captured
in
one
of
the
most
famous
political
axioms
in
our
nation's
history.
the
one
that
was
on
the
sign
on
harry
truman's
desk
in
the
oval
office,
“the
buck
stops
here”.
the
act
before
us
today
grants
the
board,
executive
power
without
effective
presidential
oversight,
under
this
law
the
buck
stops
with
the
public
company
accounting
oversight
board.
the
law
is
therefore
incompatible
with
the
constitution's
separation
of
powers.
the
government,
the
board
and
the
dissent
in
this
case
all
resist
this
conclusion.
we
have
considered
their
arguments
carefully
but
we
disagree.
respondents
for
example,
argue
that
the
second
layer
of
insulation
from
oversight
does
not
matter.
they
say
that
the
commission
has
general
oversight
over
the
board's
functions
if
not
its
members
that
this
power
is
enough
but
broad
power
over
board
functions
is
not
equivalent
to
a
power
to
remove
board
members.
the
sec
cannot
wield
a
free
hand
to
supervise
individual
members
if
it
must
destroy
the
board
in
order
to
fix
it.
moreover
the
commission's
power
over
the
board
is
not
plenary.
the
board
has
significant
independence
from
anyone's
control
in
determining
its
priorities
and
enforcing
the
laws
in
the
name
and
with
the
power
of
the
united
states.
the
dissent
too
dismisses
the
importance
of
removal
as
a
tool
of
accountability.
it
concludes
that
the
president's
practical
influence
depends
on
many
things
such
as
budgeting
authority,
relationships
between
agencies,
the
influence
of
congress
and
whether
unelected
official
support
or
resist
the
president's
policies.
but
the
framers
of
our
constitution
did
not
rest
our
liberties
on
such
bureaucratic
minutiae.
we
think
it
plain
that
when
the
president
cannot
fire
the
commission
when
he
wants
and
the
commission
cannot
fire
the
board
when
it
wants,
the
boards
independent
--
independence
from
the
president
is
greatly
expanded.
the
president
can
always
choose
to
restrain
himself
in
dealing
with
his
subordinates.
this
is
a
case
about
whether
power
exists,
not
about
how
it
should
be
exercised.
with
sincere
respect
we
think
that
the
dissent
does
not
place
sufficient
weight
on
the
on
the
constitutional
need
for
accountability.
the
dissent
points
to
the
vast
and
varied
functions
of
the
federal
government,
stresses
the
need
for
regulation
by
technical
professional
experts
and
portrays
the
board’s
dual
levels
of
insulation
as
necessary
to
a
workable
government.
but
you
can
have
a
government
that
functions
without
being
ruled
by
functionaries,
a
government
that
benefits
from
expertise
without
being
ruled
by
experts.
our
constitution
was
adopted
to
enable
the
people
to
govern
themselves
through
their
elected
leaders
who
must
be
held
accountable
for
what
the
government
does.
the
dissent
suggests
that
the
board
structure
is
not
all
that
unusual
and
predicts
dire
consequences
from
our
holding.
it
argues
that
many
other
government
positions
are
analogous
to
the
board
and
complains
that
we
do
not
resolve
the
status
of
those
positions
even
though
the
issues
concerning
those
other
positions
have
not
been
briefed,
argued
or
presented
for
our
review.
we
decline
to
do
so.
in
any
event
the
dissent
fails
in
our
view
to
support
its
premonitions
of
doing,
none
of
the
petitioner
positions
it
identifies
are
similarly
situated
to
the
board.
we
note
in
our
opinion
a
variety
of
respects
in
which
the
other
physicians
remarkably
different
from
the
one
before
us
today.
we
also
note
that
the
government
does
not
share
the
dissent's
view
that
these
other
positions
are
like
the
board
and
declined
to
cite
them
as
ground
for
not
reaching
the
ruling
we
do.
if
the
government
thought
these
positions
could
be
affected,
we
think
it
would
have
let
us
know
instead
in
a
precisely
the
opposite
representation
in
the
court
below.
there
is
no
reason
for
us
to
address
whether
these
positions
or
any
others
not
at
issue
here
are
so
structure
as
to
infringe
the
president's
constitutional
authority.
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
may
deprive
the
president
of
adequate
control
over
the
board
which
is
the
regulator
of
first
resort
and
the
primary
law
enforcement
authority
for
a
vital
sector
of
our
economy.
we
hold
that
it
cannot.
we
turn
now
to
the
practical
consequences
of
that
holding.
petitioners
argue
that
the
board
must
be
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
in
its
entirety.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
argues
that
we
should
just
answer
the
question
before
us
by
severing
the
aspect
of
the
statute
that
is
unconstitutional.
the
second
layer
of
insulation
from
presidential
control
and
otherwise
not
disturb
the
act.
we
agree
with
the
government
and
adopt
that
more
modest
approach,
with
the
unconstitutional
restrictions
excised,
the
act
remains
fully
operative
as
a
law,
the
board
may
continue
to
function
as
before
but
its
members
are
subject
to
removal
at
will
by
the
commission.
this
gives
as
much
effect
to
the
expressed
will
of
congress
as
we
can
consistent
with
the
constitution.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
congress
would
have
preferred
a
board
with
a
single
level
of
insulation
from
the
president
rather
than
no
board
at
all.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
affirmed
in
part,
reversed
in
part
and
remanded.
