as
a
practical
matter,
does
the
president
have
any
ability
to
control
what
the
board
does?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
is
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
suppose
the
president
objects
to
the
--
the
very
large
salaries
that
the
members
of
the
board
receive.
what
are
their
salaries?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
they
--
did
they
decide
that
themselves?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
president
reads
about
this
and
he
says:
this
is
outrageous;
i
want
to
change
it.
how
can
he
do
that?
remove--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--remove
that
--
remove
the
sec
commissioners
unless
they
take
action
against
the
board?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
do
you
dispute
the
proposition
that
the
more
layers
of
for-cause
removal
you
add,
the
--
the
less
control
the
president
has?
suppose
there
were
five
layers.
