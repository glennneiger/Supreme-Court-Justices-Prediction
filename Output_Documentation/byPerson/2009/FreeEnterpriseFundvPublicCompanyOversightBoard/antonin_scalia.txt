justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
sec
adopt
a
rule
that
would
give
the
sec
authority
to
--
to
stop
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
that's
the
main
point.
i
think
the
main
--
the
main
point
is
whether
the
fcc
could
stop
it
--
the
sec
could
stop
it
if
it
wanted
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
"right
now,
it
cannot".
if
it
issued
a
rule
that
said
you
need
our
approval--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
cannot
issue
such
a
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
--
why
isn't
this
simply
relieving
the
board
of
responsibility,
saying,
you
no
longer
have
responsibility
for
--
for
investigation
and
inspection
in
these
areas?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
talk
about
whether
it
can't
or
not.
why
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
--
don't
you
think
that's
what
it
means,
though,
realistically?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
no
longer
have
responsibility
to
perform
a
government
--
governmental
act,
you
no
longer
have
authority
to
perform
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
government
will
think
it
has
achieved
a
great
victory
if
it
comes
out
of
this
with
the
proposition
that
the
sec
is
not
an
independent
regulatory
agency.
and
i
don't
think
the
government
is
arguing
that
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
"for
cause"
doesn't
mean
for
failure
to
obey
the
president's
instructions,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
it's
called
an
independent
regulatory
agency,
because
it's
not
subject
to
presidential
control.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
love
to
say
that.
that
would
be
wonderful.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
an
argument
you
have
made
anyway.
can
we
go
on
to
the
arguments
that
you've
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
your
case
doesn't
rest
on
freytag.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
it's
okay
for
them
to
appoint
principal
officers,
but
not
inferior
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
oh,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
you
had
said
that.
you
really
had
me
scared
there.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
they
are
not
inferior
officers
and
also
not
principal
officers,
but
merely
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
who
appoints
--
who
appoints
the
inferior
officers
at
the
--
at
the
sec?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
those
appointments
are
presumably
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
a
shame.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
the
president
has
adequate
control
over
the
sec
only
because
he
can
dismiss
the
chairman
of
the
sec.
but
the
activity
here
is
not
governed
by
the
chairman
of
the
sec.
there's
no
role
whatever
for
the
chairmanship.
the
--
the
governance
of
this
board
is
by
the
members
of
the
sec.
so
that's
quite
different
from
saying
--
you
know,
i
--
i
think
your
syllogism
breaks
down
at
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
chairman,
which
is
--
which
is
--
which
is
the
--
what
should
i
say
--
the
knife
that
the
president
has
into
the
sec,
has
no
role
in
the
control
of
this
board.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
but,
you
know,
congress
--
congress
can
change
the
statutory
authority
of
any
agency
just
like
that.
does
that
mean
that
congress
is
controlling
the
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
--
that
the
ability
to
take
away
responsibility
for
an
agency
--
from
an
agency
is
the
same
as
controlling
what
authority
that
agency
does
exercise.
it
seems
to
me
they
are
two
different
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
not
true.
he
can
remove
--
he
can
remove
the
chairman
of
the
sec.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
cannot
--
he
cannot
remove
the
commissioners.
and
it's
the
commissioners
that
govern
the
board,
not
the
chairman.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
please
change
it?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
do
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
did,
i
did.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
did
overrule
it,
by
the
way,
in
--
in
morrison,
didn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
kagan,
the
government
argues
here
that
the
head
of
department
is
all
of
the
commissioners.
elsewhere,
it
is
the
chairman
of
the
sec
who
--
who
appoints
inferior
officers.
now,
which
is
it?
are
all
those
appointments
by
the
chairman
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
something
quite
different.
he
makes
the
appointments.
they
can
overturn
it,
but
the
appointment
must
be
made
by
the
head
of
the
department,
and
the
appointments
are
not
made
by
the
commissioners.
they
are
made
by
the
chairman.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
other
agency
composed
of
inferior
officers
that
has
the
power
to
acquire
its
own
budget,
as
this
board
does,
by
simply
assessing
a
tax
upon
the
people
that
it
regulates?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sec
can
overturn
it,
but
it's
up
to
the
board
--
the
board
can
do
it.
do
you
know
of
any
parallel
situation
where
there
is
a,
supposedly,
agency
composed
of
inferior
officers
who
have
the
power
to
tax
the
public
unless
it's
overturned
by
somebody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can
say
the
same
--
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
congress.
i
mean,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
control
that
an
executive
officer
normally
is
supposed
to
have
over
inferior
officers;
when
they
do
something,
you
can
take
away
their
authority.
--congress
can
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
nothing,
which
is
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
when
i
was
olc,
i
would
--
i
advised
the
president,
you
can't
interfere
with
--
i
think,
if
the
president
called
up
the
fcc
and
said,
i
want
you
to
rule
this
way,
i
want
this
kind
of
a
rule
from
the
fcc,
i
think
there
would
be
an
impeachment
motion
in
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
set
up
that
agency
to
be
independent
from
the
president.
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
okay
for
him
to
ask
them?
it's
okay
for
him
to
suggest
to
an
independent
regulatory
agency
that
this
is
how
he
wants
something
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
instance
where
that
has
happened?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
does
the
treasury
department
tell
the
sec
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
takes
the
initiative?
the
sec
doesn't
request
that
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sec
does
not
request
that
information;
the
treasury
department
just
butts
in?
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
one
thing
for
the
sec
to
ask
the
treasury
department's
view.
it's
another
for
the
treasury
department
to
butt
in.
does
it
butt
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
say
it
again--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
don't
assume
that
they--
