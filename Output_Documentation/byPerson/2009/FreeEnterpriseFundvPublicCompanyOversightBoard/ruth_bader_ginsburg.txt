justice
ruth
bader

why
do
you
call
it
an
independent
regulatory
agency?
i
mean,
congress
wanted
it
to
be
independent
of
the
profession.
that
much
is
clear.
it
didn't
want
it
to
be
independent
of
the
sec,
so
why
are
you
characterizing
it
as
an
independent
regulatory
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
sec
doesn't
have
another
overseer.
i
mean,
the
sec
is
set
up
like
the
fcc,
the
other
independent
regulatory
commissions,
but
this
is
a
board
that
has
a
relationship
with
the
sec,
where
it
can't
do
anything
that
doesn't
have
the
sec's
approval.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
can't
even
issue
a
subpoena
without
the
sec's
approval.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
sec
really
could
stop
anything?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happened
to
the
petitioners
here?
i
think,
if
you
were
challenging
what
happened
to
the
petitioners
here,
certainly
it
would
be
a
question
of
how
you
would
have
to
do
that.
you
ordinarily
go
through
the
internal
proceedings.
but
here
you
are
bringing
a
facial
challenge
and
you
say,
never
mind
any
particular
proceedings;
the
whole
thing
is
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
both
sides--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
both
sides
agreed
that
there
is
no
statute,
everybody
agrees
to
that.
but
i
thought
that
the
government,
just
as
your
side,
agreed
that
the
president
could
dismiss
an
sec
commissioner
for
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
there's
no
statute
that
says
anything
either
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
cause
would
be
short
of
the
5-year
term.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
mean,
mr.
carvin,
that
the
sec
cannot
appoint
heads
of
--
heads
of
its
divisions?
i
assume
that
they
would
fit
within
the
characterization
"inferior
officers".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
but
if
the
sec
can't
appoint--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
so
what
are
--
so
what
are
the
heads
of
the
various
divisions
of
the
sec?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
aren't
there
--
aren't
there
people
within
the
independent
regulatory
commissions
that
have
jobs
comparable
to
people
who
are
in
the
departments--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
head
of
the
department
can
appoint?
so
who
can
appoint
such
people
in
the
fec,
the
ftc,
the
fcc,
and
so
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
whole
thing
would
be
constitutional
if,
instead
of
giving
the
appointing
power
to
the
commission,
they
had
given
it
to
the
chairman?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
a
highly
unlikely
scenario?
i
mean,
this
thing
won't
work
unless
these
two
are
working
in
harmony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
kagan,
i
thought
that
--
the
chief
asked
a
question,
he
posed
a
sanction,
and
i
thought
that
any
sanction
the
board
wants
to
impose
has
to
be
approved
by
the
sec?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
--
there
is
--
it
was
working
okay
with
the
stock
exchange.
it
wasn't
working
okay
with
the
accountants.
and
there's
a
problem.
there's
a
problem
that
congress
had
to
solve.
it
wanted
to
tighten
the
oversight
of
the
auditing
function.
and
they
wanted
to
have
people
who
were
not
beholden
to
the
profession,
but
who
were
knowledgeable
and
could
command
high
salaries
to
be
doing
this
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
if
they
--
would
it
work
if
the
board
members
were
proposed
by
the
sec,
by
sec
commissioners,
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
president?
would
that
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
nominee
would
be
--
by
a
nomination.
the
names
would
be
presented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
were
--
i'm
sorry,
then.
i
interrupted
you,
but
i
wanted
you
to
give
me
your
full
picture
of
how
this
could
be
done,
how
congress
could
accomplish
its
goal
of
having
a
strong,
effective
oversight
body?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
would
be
totally
separate.
then
you
would
--
you'd
say
it
would
have
to
be
a
totally
separate
independent
regulatory
agency.
it
could
not
be
put
under
the
wing
of
the
sec.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
know
--
we
don't
know
what's
fictional
and
what
is
not
here,
because
you
came
in,
and
you
don't
have
a
particular
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
another
instance
where
congress
set
up
a
scheme,
and
without
having
a
particular
case
of
an
individual
who
has
been
hurt,
you
come
in
and
say:
we
might
sometime
be
hurt
by
this,
so
we
want
the
whole
thing
knocked
down
in
the
absence
of
any
concrete
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
took
away
--
i
mean,
one
big
point
was
the
double
for-cause.
so
let's
say
we
have
said
that
the
sec
could
fire
board
members,
period.
then
that
would
remove
the
double
for-cause.
would
this
statute
then
be
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
it's
not
the
double
for
--
the
double
for-cause
isn't,
in
your
judgment,
what
sinks
this
statute?
