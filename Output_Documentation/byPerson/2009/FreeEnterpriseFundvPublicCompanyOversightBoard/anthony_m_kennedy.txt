what
happens--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
happens
to
the
information
that
the
board
obtains?
can
the
board
go
public
with
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
is
it
all
confidential?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
burden
of
time
of
compliance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
burden
is
because
it's
difficult
and
expensive
to
comply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
--
but
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
the
harm
to
your
client
and
to
the
--
those
similarly
situated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
the
cost
of
compliance.
what
other
harms
or
dangers
or
risks
are
inherent
in
the
power
of
the
board
unmonitored,
unchecked
by
the
sec,
to
investigate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
the
question
is
--
i
assume
it's
the
follow-up
question
that
justice
ginsburg
is
interested
in
--
under
your
view
of
the
case,
why
is
that
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
--
that's
the
history
and
tradition
of
this
board,
which
isn't
very
long.
but
the
history
and
tradition
of
boards
like
this
is
that
their
investigative
powers
are
independent.
now,
you
say
that
there
could
be
a
rule,
but
that
just
isn't
the
way
it
works.
and
if
you
refer
us
to
history
and
tradition
for
other
purposes,
we
ought
to
look
at
the
operational
principles,
operational
assumptions
of
this
board.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
ask
--
i
want
to
ask
one
thing:
you
want
us
to
imply
or
find
--
or
you
want
us
to
infer
from
the
statute
that
there's
a
power
in
the
president
to
remove
sec
commissioners
for
cause?
you
want
us
to
find
that
that
is
implied
in
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
what
is
--
what
is
the
authority
for
us
to
find
that
there
is
an
implication
in
the
statute
to
remove
just
for
cause?
there's
--
wouldn't
that
be
unique
in
our
precedents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
if
there
is
a
removal
power
implied,
why
isn't
it
removal
for
all
purposes?
how
--
why
can
it
be
limited
to
just
for
cause?
what
authority
do
we
have
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are
talking
--
we
are
talking
about
independent
or
quasi-independent
agencies,
and
i
understood
solicitor
general
kagan
to
say
that
it's
quite
all
right
with
an
independent
agency
for
the
president
to
phone
them
on
an
ongoing
basis
and
say,
do
this,
and
do
that.
do
you
agree
that
that's
what
a
president
ought
to
do
with
an
independent
agency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
call
them
on
a
routine
basis,
to
supervise
what
they
are
doing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
--
they
--
this
board
has
authority
to
--
to
tax
those
people
it
regulates,
to
issue
subpoenas,
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
isn't
subject
to
the
operations
of
the
president,
if
he
has
to
go
through
an
independent
agency.
are
you
encouraging
the
president,
on
an
ongoing,
daily
basis,
to
instruct
an
independent
agency
what
he
wants
done?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
humphrey's
--
humphrey's
executor
was
not
a
specific
issue.
it
was
just
the
general
qualifications.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
--
i
understand
that.
