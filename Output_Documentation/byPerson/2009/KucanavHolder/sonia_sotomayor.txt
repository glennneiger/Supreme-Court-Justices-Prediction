but
that
provision
came
after
the
original
jurisdictional
stripping,
a
number
of
years
after.
so
why
should
we
look
to
that
to
inform
what
congress
intended
at
an
earlier
time
with
respect
to
judicial
review
or
the
scope
of
the
review?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
talking
about
us
acting
as
policymakers.
the
question
is:
why
should
we
be
looking
to
that
to
define
what
congress
intended
then,
when
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--stripped
jurisdiction
earlier
or
granted
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
couldn't
we
look
at
the
fact
that
when
congress
was
considering
whether
to
put
back
into
the
jurisdiction-stripping
statute
an
exception
for
constitutional
claims,
it
then
knew,
because
the
courts
of
appeals
except
for
the
seventh,
who
just
recently
did
it,
were
routinely
taking
jurisdiction
over
motions
to
reopen?
don't
you
think
that
was
the
time
for
them
to
tell
us:
hey,
you
guys
got
it
wrong;
we
are
going
to
make
motions
to
reopen
statutorily
discretionary,
so
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
this,
let's
clear
up
what
our
intent
is?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wait
a
minute,
you
are
--
you
are
arguing
from
a
real
negative,
because
some
courts
had
said
that
other
statutes
were
covered
by
the
jurisdictional
bar.
you
are
arguing
that
they
knew
that
no
court
had
held
that
motions
to
reopen
--
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
for
motions
to
reopen,
that
somehow
it
should
have--
