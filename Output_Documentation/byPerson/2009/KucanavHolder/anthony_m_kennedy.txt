justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
subchapter
2
does
talk
about
a
special
rule
on
reopening
for
battered
spouses,
children,
and
parents.
is
that
a
statute
where
the
discretion
is
committed
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
--
so,
absent
the
regulation,
you
would
interpret
the
statute
as
saying
there
is
no
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
that
wasn't
my
question.
let's
say
there
is
no
regulation.
and
the
statute
says,
number
one,
there
shall
--
so
subchapter
2
of
the
statute
says,
number
one,
there
shall
be
motions
to
reopen,
and
then
there
is
a
special
rule
for
battered
spouses.
now,
you
would
interpret
that
statute,
absent
any
regulation,
as
saying
this
is
not
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
does
an
attorney
general
decide
without
--
without
using
discretion?
he
must
grant,
in
any
case?
whether
a
battered
spouse
waits
for
15
years,
he
must
grant?
just
under
the
statute,
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
there
must
be
a
discretionary
component
implicit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
battered
spouse
provision.
the
battered
spouse
provision
specifically
says
that
in
the
attorney
general's
discretion,
he
may
waive
the
time
limit
for
the
one
year
for
the
battered
spouse.
now,
that
surely
is
discretion
specified
--
and
i
think
the
word
2.
so
there
should
be
no
judicial
review
as
to
that.
you
would
have
to
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
then
the
thing
that
congress
cares
about
most
is
something
the
court
can't
review.
that
is
counterintuitive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
my
question
with
reference
to
motions
to
--
to
reopen?
that
is
specified
under
subchapter
2.
that's
right
there
in
subchapter
2:
there
shall
be
a
motion
to
reopen.
now,
if
you
had
no
regulations
on
it,
wouldn't
you
say
that
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
no,
that's
not
my
question.
hypothetical;
not
a
real
case.
just
a
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
so
we
can
talk
about
the
statute.
the
statute
says
there
--
subchapter
2,
the
one
we
are
most
interested
in,
specifies
--
and
that's
one
of
the
words
--
that
there
shall
be
a
motion
to
reopen.
now,
don't
you
think
that's
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
absent
any
regulations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
absent
a
regulation,
there
would
be
jurisdiction
stripping
under
that
provision,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
but
you
would
give
me,
or
would
you,
the
concession
that
--
or
agreement
that
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
waive
the
time
limit
for
battered
spouses
is
committed
to
him?
and
that's
non-judiciary
review,
wouldn't
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
that
seems
odd,
that
the
thing
congress
cares
about
so
much
that
it
makes
a
specific
provision
can't
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
an
idea
of
how
many
motions
to
reopen
are
brought
to
the
courts
for
review
each
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
are
talking
about
2
or
3,000
petitions
to
the
court
each
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
because
that
would
be
a
question
of
law
which
is
accepted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
any
of
those
courts
said
that
they
don't
have
a
workload
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are
talking
about
what
is
specified
under
subchapter
2.
i
think
that's
an
important
word,
in
addition
to
"under".
and
motions
to
reopen
are
specified,
and
it
doesn't
say
discretion.
it
just
says,
there
shall
be
a
motion
to
reopen.
do
you
get
any
mileage
from
that,
or
you
seem
to
rest
your
argument
instead
on
the
regulations?
and
i
think
that's
almost
a
weaker
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
--
you
consider
--
you
--
you
think
it's
plausible
to
have
a
regime
where
motions
to
reopen
are
not
discretionary
at
all,
absent
regulation?
that
would
seem
very
odd
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
absent
the
special
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
immigration
act
that
we
are
considering
if
we
were
just
under
the
apa,
that
a
motion
to
reopen
would
be
committed
by
law
to
agency
discretion
under
702?
because
it
seems
to
me
that,
you
know
there
are
sources
we
could
look
to
to
see
whether
or
not
it's
rationally
exercised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
actually
think
it
helps
you
because
--
there
is
--
there
is
something
to
review,
the
agency
does
have
discretion.
but
this
statute
strips
it,
because
it
provides
for
motions
to
reopen,
specifically.
but
of
course--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
don't
take
that--
