mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
enacting
section
1252(a)(2)(b),
congress
limited
its
reduction
of
judicial
review
to
where
the
authority
for
the
attorney
general's
discretion
is
specified
under
subchapter
2
of
chapter
12
of
title
8.
congress
did
not
express
any
intent
to
remove
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
discretionary
decisions,
the
authority
for
which
is
specified
under
any
other
subchapter
or
in
regulations,
nor
did
congress
express
any
intent
to
delegate
its
constitutional
responsibility
to
determine
federal
jurisdiction
to
the
attorney
general--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--the
regulation
that
grants
discretion
with
regard
to
motions
to
reopen
comes
from
a
section
in
subchapter
1,
not
subchapter
2,
of
the
regulations.
and
that
was
authorized
by
section
1103
of
title
8.
i
should
say
it
authorized
the
statute
for
the
regulations
in
subchapter
1,
not
subchapter
2.
and
that's--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--section
1103,
your
honor?
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
section
1103(g)(2)
authorizes
the
attorney
general--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--sure.
it
--
it
indicates
on
page
18
of
the
reply
brief,
that,
quote,
"establish
such
regulations.
"
"as
he
deems
necessary
for
carrying
out
his
authority
under
the
provisions
of
this
chapter.
"
the
fact
that
the
statute
we
are
focused
on
states
that
authority
must
be
specified
in
this
subchapter
--
being
subchapter
2--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--the
words
used
in
the
--
in
the
statute
is
"under",
which,
of
course,
has
a
variety
of
definitions.
we
believe
that
taking
the
statute
in
context,
that
the
correct
definition
to
apply
is
"according
to"
or
"within".
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
congress
could
have
said
"in",
but
i
think
congress
made
it
clear
by
using
the
phrase
"authority
specified
under",
so
we
are
not
--
we
don't
have
a
situation
where,
as
congress
usually
would
do,
they
would
say
"a
regulation
under
such-and-such
a
statute.
"
where
congress
uses
the
word
"regulation".
there
is
the
--
the
term
"regulation"
is
not
used
in
the
statute.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
we
would
look
to
section
1103
in
subchapter
1.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
although
we
don't
think
regulations
are
included,
even
if
they
were,
it's
not
in
the
subchapter.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
i
think
that
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
historically,
on
motions
to
reopen,
there
have
been
--
there
has
been
discretion.
what
the
regulation
did
was
to
codify
that
historical
authority
and
to
be
consistent
with
what
the
court
said
is
always
done,
but
i
think,
in
interpreting
the
scope
of
congress's
intent
to
reduce
judicial
review,
we
need
to
be
very
careful
about
that,
obviously.
and
so,
therefore,
when
it
says
"as
under
authority
specified
in
this
subchapter.
"
we
need
to
find
the
authority
in
the
subchapter,
which
we
don't.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
no,
your
honor,
because
subchapter
2
does
not
say
that
the
attorney
general
has
discretion
to
decide
motions
to
reopen.
that
language
is
only
found
in
the
regulation.
the
only
reference--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--absent
the
regulation,
i
would
interpret
the
statute
as
being
silent
as
to
the--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--i
would
interpret
the
statute
as
not
providing
for
discretion,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
no.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
yes.
no.
i'm
--
i'm
not
trying
to
say
that,
your
honor.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--i
would
disagree
in
--
in
this
way:
if
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
whether
there
is
discretion,
the
court
can
look
to
--
the
court
could
look
to
other
sources
to
determine--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
provision
on
battered
spouses
creates
in
a
--
allows
you
to
bring
more
than
one
motion
to
reopen.
it
does
--
it
does
not
address
the
issue
of
discretion.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
judicial
review
of
motions
to
reopen
has
--
has
been
the
traditional
normal
process
for
the
court
to
take.
i
think
what
congress
was
doing
here
was
saying:
in
certain
specified
instances,
we
are
going
to
remove
judicial
review,
but
not
in
all
instances.
and
the
question
is,
where
did
congress
draw
the
line?
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
well,
let
me
suggest
several
reasons,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
first,
if
the
court
was
to
read
the
statute
as
allowing
a
regulation
to
create
discretion
and,
therefore,
to
remove
judicial
review--
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
--that's
correct.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
and
courts
frequently
review
decisions
for
abuse
of
discretion.
and
motions
to
reopen,
i
would
suggest,
are
particularly
important
because
it
creates
a
safety
net
for
review.
it
deals
with
--
like,
rule
60
of
the
federal
rules
deals
with
potentially
new
evidence,
matters
that
weren't
available
to
bring
initially,
and
it's
important
that
potential
mistakes
be
reviewed.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
yes,
as
to
the
--
as
to
waiving
--
as
to
waiving
the
--
on
the
number
of
motions,
yes.
from
that
point
on.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
congress
specified
some
30
instances
of
discretion
to
the
attorney
general
in
subchapter
2,
and
i
believe
it
drew
the
line
there
and
said,
if
we
did
not
specify
it
in
subchapter
2,
then
it
is
reviewable,
just
as
courts
have
traditionally
reviewed
these
matters.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
the
regulation
regarding
motions
to
reopen
existed
before
the
statute.
congress
could
readily
have
made
that
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so,
but
it
did
not.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
section
1252(b)(6)
mandates
that
review
of
the
underlying
decision
should
be
consolidated
with
review
of
a
motion
to
reopen.
i
think
that
tells
us
several
things.
the
first
and
foremost
of
which
is
congress
intended
there
to
be
review
of
motions
to
reopen
--
at
least
some
motions
to
reopen.
to
try
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
questions,
i
think
one
can
extrapolate
from
the
consolidation
provision
that,
if
it
is
impossible
to
consolidate
because
there
is
no
review
of
the
underlying
decision,
you
do
not
get
to
have
a
review
of
those
motions
to
reopen.
and
that
is
referenced,
i
believe,
in
the
government's
brief,
at
footnote
15
--
excuse
me,
with
some
cases
cited,
where
courts
have
so
held.
we
did
not
focus
on
that
because
that
is
not
mr.
kucana's
issue.
as
the
court
has
alluded
to,
mr.
kucana's
issue
is
the
nature
of
asylum
based
upon
changed
country
conditions,
and
those
situations
are
where
it
may
be
a
matter
of
life
and
death,
certainly,
also
a
matter
of
--
of
liberty,
to
be
able
to
bring
forward
new
evidence,
which
did
not
exist
before,
about
changed
country
conditions,
and
it
is
not
two
bites
at
the
apple.
it's
the
first
bite
at
current
conditions,
which
is
essential.
with
regard
to
the
case
of
webster
v.
doe,
that
my
colleague
cited
orally,
that
was
an
extremely
unusual
case
in
which
the
court
essentially
said
that
it
could
not
--
it
did
not
have
any
criteria
to
evaluate
the
discretion
used
by
the
director
of
the
cia.
that
is
certainly
not
the
situation
we
have
here,
where
we
are
dealing
with
motions
to
reopen,
which
are
analogous
to
rule
60
(b)
and
which
are
routinely
reviewed
on
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
additionally,
let
me
note
that,
if
you
were
to
determine
that
the
statutory
language
"specified
under"
is
ambiguous
that
the
applicable
canons
both
point
us
to
favoring
judicial
review,
favoring
judicial
--
favoring
judicial
review
and
not
essentially
allowing
the
executive
to
pass
a
regulation
which
insulates
itself
from
judicial
review.
that
would
be
both
the
clear
statements
requirement,
as
well
as
the
principle
laid
down
by
this
court
that,
in
an
ambiguous
situation
dealing
with
deportation,
ambiguities
are
to
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
alien.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
rick
m.
schoenfield
thank
you.
