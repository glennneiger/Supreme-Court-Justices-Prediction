2.
the
--
the
key
word
that
is
emphasized
in
this
case
is,
it's
"under",
instead
of
"in".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
clearer
if
they
had
said
"in".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
clarify,
what
is
the
provision
about
battered
spouses?
i
thought
that
that
had
to
do
with
you
could
have
more
than
one
petition
to
reopen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
rule
is,
you
may
reopen
once
in
that
--
that
provision
on
battered
spouses,
but
if
you
are
in
that
category,
you
can
reopen
again?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ones
that
have
been
codified
by
statute,
those
prior
to
the
codification
will,
by
regulation.
is
that
--
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
where
the
motion
--
where
--
where
did
it
originate?
but
it
--
it
was
--
we
now
know
it's
in
the
regulations.
it's
in
the
statute.
but
how
did
motions
to
reopen
bia
decisions
originate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
before
you
sit
down:
your
response
to
the
briefs
here
suggests
that
all
of
this
is
beside
the
point
because
this
was
the
--
a
second
motion
to
reopen,
and
the
statute
allows
only
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
the
motion
to
reopen,
there
is
--
seventh
circuit
stands
alone,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
many
circuits
are
on
the
other
side?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
--
ever
a
decision
in
any
of
those
six
circuits
that
went
the
way
the
seventh
circuit
went
on
the
motion
to
reopen?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
rhyme
or
reason
why
from
universe
of
things
that
could
be
reviewed
in
court,
congress
put
some
of
the
them
in
the
statute
and
left
others
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
--
the
question
isn't
whether
the
attorney
general
or
the
bia
exercises
discretion.
in
all
of
these
the
attorney
general
exercises
discretion.
the
question
is
immunity
from
court
review,
and
ordinarily
that's
done
by
statute.
and
i
do
not
know
of
another
instance,
perhaps
you
do,
where
the
decision
was
a
matter
that
the
agency
rules
on
will
be
exempt
from
judicial
review
if
made
by
the
agency
itself
--
the
very
agency
that
makes
the
decision,
rather
than
by
the
legislature.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i'm
not
questioning
the
discretion.
the
attorney
general
has
been
given
discretion
to
rule
on
the
matter,
but
the
question
is,
does
that
mean
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
will
be
immune
from
judicial
review?
congress
might
well
say,
agency,
you
decide
what
is
in
your
discretion,
but
not
say,
and
agency,
we
delegate
to
you,
too,
the
matter
whether
the
court
will
--
will
review
your
exercise
of
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
--
if
your
interpretation
of
"under"
is
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
other
examples
where
the
under
is
commonly
used
statute
and
regulations
thereunder,
but
in
the
appendix
that
you
have
given
us,
it
says,
"under
regulations".
under
is
always
coupled
with
regulations,
and
you
want
us
to
transpose
that
to
a
statute
that
conspicuously
did
not
say,
"regulations".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
motion
to
reopen
removal
proceedings
formally
called
deportation
proceedings
is
an
important
safeguard
to
ensure
the
juxtaposition
of
immigration
matters.
federal
courts
have
reviewed
administrative
decisions
denying
reopening
of
immigration
proceedings
since
at
least
1916.
this
case
concerns
access
to
that
check
on
executive
determinations.
the
petitioner,
a
citizen
of
albania,
moved
to
reopen
his
removal
proceedings
alleging
new
evidence
in
support
of
his
plea
for
asylum.
an
immigration
judge
denied
the
motion
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
sustained
that
ruling.
petitioner
sought
judicial
review
in
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
dismissed
his
petition
holding
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
review
the
board's
determination.
for
that
ruling
the
court
relied
on
a
statute
barring
judicial
review
of
certain
administrative
actions,
those
specified
as
discretionary
under
the
relevant
part
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
although
nothing
in
that
act
specifies
the
board's
discretion
to
rule
on
reopening
motions,
a
regulation
published
by
the
attorney
general
does
so.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
attorney
general's
regulation
suffices
to
insulate
the
board's
decision
from
court
oversight.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
and
hold
that
federal
courts
retain
jurisdiction
to
review
reopening
denials
in
immigration
matters.
that
is
so
we
explain
because
congress
reserved
to
itself
and
did
not
vest
in
the
attorney
general
authority
to
bar
judicial
review.
examination
of
the
relevant
statute’s
text
and
context
leads
us
to
this
determination.
we
note
that
other
similar
limitations
of
judicial
review
placed
in
the
statute
just
before
and
just
after
the
provision
in
question
depends
solely
on
statutory
provisions
not
on
any
administrative
regulation
to
define
the
scope
of
the
limitation.
our
reading
of
the
controlling
provision
keeps
it
in
harmony
with
its
surrounding
provisions.
we
also
take
into
account
the
character
of
many
of
the
immigration
decisions
congress
has
expressly
shielded
from
judicial
review.
they
are
in
the
main
substantive
decisions
about
an
alien’s
plea
to
remain
in
the
usa,
decisions
made
by
the
executive
as
a
matter
of
grace.
decisions
on
reopening
motions
in
contrast
are
not
matters
of
grace,
they
are
adjunct
rulings
concerned
primarily
with
procedural
fairness.
finally
two
basic
considerations
strongly
support
our
determination.
first,
separation
of
powers
concerns
appreciation
that
federal
court
jurisdiction
is
controlled
by
congress
not
by
the
executive
and
second
the
familiar
presumption
favoring
judicial
review
of
administrative
actions.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
