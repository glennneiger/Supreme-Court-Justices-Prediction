justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
fact,
if
--
what
we
have
is
a
motion
in
the
category
of
grace,
except
for
asylum,
saying,
of
course,
the
justice
department
makes
a
decision
that
can't
be
reviewed.
but
then
the
department,
let's
imagine,
has
a
regulation,
and
it
says:
anyone
can
ask
the
department
for
rehearing
in
such
a
matter,
and
we'll
decide
as
a
matter
of
grace
whether
to
give
you
one.
now,
you're
saying
that
would
be
reviewed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
it
be
reviewed?
you
just
said
it
was.
you
said
every
procedural
decision
is
reviewed,
which
to
me,
makes
no
sense
to
begin
with,
because
i
can't
imagine
that
congress,
while
they
don't
want
them
to
review
the
substance
at
all,
is
perfectly
happy
to
have
the
courts
review
every
detailed
matter
of
extra
time
to
file
a
brief,
extra
time
to
have
an
oral
argument.
all
those
matters
would
be
reviewable,
i
guess,
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly
the
same
is
true
of
the
substantive
decision.
i
mean,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
i
want
to
know
--
look,
this
is
where
i'm
going.
i
don't
think
your
--
i
can't
find
a
reading
of
this
statute
that
makes
sense,
except
for
one
which
i
am
trying
on,
and
i'm
sure
there
is
a
lot
wrong
with
it,
that
what
congress
meant
to
do
here
is
to
take
all
the
procedural
decisions
including
reopening
ones,
and
treat
them
the
same
way
that
they
are
treating
the
substantive
decisions.
so
that
in
his
case,
he
wins.
because
he
gets
review
of
the
substance,
he
should
get
review
of
a
reopening.
it's
the
same
thing.
and
in
some
other
case,
they'd
lose,
because
if
you
don't
get
review
of
the
substance,
you
shouldn't
get
review
of
the
reopening.
both
are
the
same
thing.
they
are
just
filed
at
different
times.
so
that,
to
me,
is
the
only
reading
of
this
statute
that
i
have
yet
found
that
made
sense.
but
since
no
one
argues
for
it,
i'm
sure
i
must
be
making
some
huge
mistake.
but
that's
what
you
can
tell
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
you
are
on
the
wrong
side,
if
you
agree
with
it,
because
--
no,
you
are
on
the
right
side,
because
he
wins.
no,
you're
on
the
right
side.
he
wins.
i
take
that
back.
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
--
well,
new
things
have
happened.
he
doesn't
just
want
to
relitigate
it.
new
things
have
happened;
that's
why
he
wants
it
reopened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he's
not,
but
his
motion
to
reopen
is
--
it's
my
hypothetical;
i
want
to
deal
with
it;
i
accept
yours.
my
hypothetical
is,
something
new
came
up.
that's
why
he
wants
it
reopened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
something
new
came
up.
that's
why
he
--
i
think,
isn't
it
true,
often
people
want
it
reopened
because
something
new
came
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
asking
you,
what
possible
sense
could
it
make?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
we're
--
two
issues.
one
is
grace
in
respect
to
--
let's
call
it
fraud,
and
he
loses.
something
new
comes
up,
and
what
does
he
want?
grace
in
respect
of
fraud
in
light
of
this
new
fact.
now,
my
question
would
be:
what
possible
sense
does
it
make
to
say
the
courts
cannot
review
the
first,
but
they
could
review
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
by
the
way,
this
reopening
is
done
by
regulation,
not
done
by
statute.
that's
where
i
get
to
the
problem.
you
are
trying
to
distinguish
between
whether
it's
done
by
regulation
or
done
by
statute.
and
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
on
a
very
different
context.
treat
the
motion
to
reopen
the
same
as
you
treat
the
initial
motion,
whether
it's
done
by
regulation
or
whether
it's
done
by
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
say
anything
about,
apparently,
this
idiosyncratic
thought
that
i
have
had?
this
is
--
is
--
my
thought
is
that
both
sides
are
arguing.
we
just
looked
to
see
if
it's
discretion
given
by
statute
or
given
by
regulation.
and
we
draw
the
line
on
reviewability
there.
now,
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
big
set
of
cases,
including
frauds
and
various
things
where
there
is
some
discretion
substantively
to
let
the
person
stay.
now,
on
that
big
set
of
cases,
the
statute
says
if
it's
fraud,
et
cetera,
we
don't
want
review.
but
if
it's
asylum,
we
want
review;
isn't
that
how
it
works,
basically,
basically?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
fine.
so,
i'm
saying
instead
of
looking
to
see
whether
it's
a
rehearing
or
procedural
or
reopening
matter,
period,
you
look
to
see
whether
it
has
to
do
with
the
basic
category.
if
it's
something
that
congress
doesn't
want
courts
to
meddle
in,
that
carries
over
to
reopening,
which
is
the
same
thing;
it
carries
over
to
rehearing
petitions,
they
are
all
about
the
same
thing.
and
if
it's
something
that
congress
did
want
courts
to
meddle
in,
like
asylum,
it
carries
over
to
reopening,
and
it
carries
over
to
a
rehearing
petitions
and
other
such
matters.
so
congress
has
one
simple
judgment:
we
want
courts
to
meddle
in
these
affairs
substantively
or
we
don't.
and
our
job
would
be
to
say,
right,
that's
what
you
want,
unless
its
unconstitutional,
that's
what
we
give
you.
do
you
see
the
way
--
i'm
just
drawing
the
line
vertically
instead
of
horizontally.
but
i
agree,
nobody
has.
now,
to
me
that
makes
sense,
but
apparently
to
no
one
else.
so
i
would
like
to
be
talked
out.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
leave
anyone
out.
no
one
is
universal.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know
they
didn't?
i
mean,
there
is
such
a
thing
in
the
law
called
--
what
we
think
of
often,
they
often
use
the
word
"ancillary"
describing.
and
when
congress
passes
a
thing
that
has
to
do
with
x,
you
often
interpret
a
statute
to
carry
with
it
the
application
to
ancillary
matters,
the
thing
that
are
bound
up
in
x,
even
though
they
don't
have
a
separate
sentence
because
you
can't
think
of
everything
that
describes
every
matter
ancillary
to
x.
that's
normal
in
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
we
would
say
those
decisions
specified
includes
those
decisions
that
are
totally
wrapped
up
in
the
same
thing.
so
that
if
a
person
tries
to
escape
this,
by
simply
making
his
main
argument
in
a
rehearing
petition,
he
can't
escape
it,
because
it's
really
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
not?
this
is
not
a
matter
that
is
the
subject
of
the
special
provision.
a
reopening
petition
is
the
same
kind
of
thing,
identical
to
the
initial
petition,
and
so
something
that
applies
to
the
initial
petition
applies
to
the
reopening
petition
because
they
were
the
same
kind
of
animal.
if
you
have
a
--
you
know
--
i
mean,
okay.
forget
it.
i
see
the
point,
no
point
going
further.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
taken
great
trouble
to
make
certain
that
courts
can
review
asylum
decisions,
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
a
court
to
review
a
reopening
of
an
asylum
matter,
which
can
be
done,
after
all,
only
if
something
new
comes
up
that
justifies
asylum?
for
example,
a
new
government
comes
and
takes
over
the
country,
and
now,
they
are
going
to
murder
the
person,
and
that
couldn't
be
considered
the
first
time
because
the
old
government
was
there,
and
they
were
just
going
to
torture
him,
all
right?
so
--
so
there's
something
new
here.
now,
why
would
any
human
being
say,
we
want
to
get
courts
involved
in
the
first
decision,
but
we
want
to
keep
them
out
of
the
second
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
reopening
is
not
a
bite
at
the
apple.
reopening
is
a
new
thing;
at
least,
by
and
large,
it
is
supposed
to
be
--
a
change.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
and
that's
why
i
ended
up
with
this
unusual--
[laughter]
