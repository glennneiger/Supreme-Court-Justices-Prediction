chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-911,
kucana
v.
holder.
mr.
schoenfield.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
what
authority
were
these
regulations
issued?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
were
to
evaluate
the
validity
of
the
regulation,
as
opposed
to,
like,
an
apa
case
or
similar
to
that,
what
statutory
provision
would
you
look
to
to
see
if
the
regulation
was
consistent
with
that
statutory
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
--
is
that
right?
would
--
would
subchapter
1
give
you
much
insight
into
the
scope
of
the
regulation
and
how
it
was
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
authority
under
which
the
attorney
general
purported
to
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
miss
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
--
i'm
sorry,
do
you
want
to
finish?
okay.
i
--
i
find
it
curious
--
and
maybe
you
can
illuminate
it
for
me
--
that
the
justice
department
is
before
us,
arguing
that
the
justice
department
can't
be
trusted
without
judicial
review.
and
i
find
that
doubly
curious
when
the
justice
department
won
on
the
opposite
position
below.
i
mean,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
statute
is
so
absolutely
clear
that
you
could
not
stand
there
and
say
that
your
colleague
down
the
hall
in
the
justice
department
could
be
trusted
to
exercise
his
discretion,
but
in
fact
you
are
saying:
i
know
we
won
on
that,
but
we
are
not
going
to
defend
it
because
we
think
the
attorney
general
needs
judicial
review
to
help
him
stay
in
line?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
if
you
take
--
if
you
continued
to
argue
the
position
you
won
on
before
the
--
before
the
seventh
circuit,
it
wouldn't
be
that
the
standard
of
review
is
--
is
so
deferential
that
it
is
okay.
it
would
be
there
is
no
review
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
was
the
opposite
before
2004,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
think
it's
so
bad,
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
to
do
it.
why
do
you
need
a
court
to
tell
you
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
keep
saying
"the
board".
under
the
statute,
it
is
the
attorney
general,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
he
doesn't
like
what
they
do,
he
has
the
authority
to
act
himself.
whenever
somebody
delegates
authority,
they
retain
authority
to
act
themselves.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
leiter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
suppose
it's
a
large
question,
if
you
are
talking
about,
presumably,
the
unusual
cases
in
which
the
motion
to
reopen
is
--
is
justified,
that
you
are
talking
about
2,000
or
3,000
cases,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
those
are
--
should
be
reviewed
in
the
executive
branch
or
should
be
reviewed
in
the
judicial
branch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
are
looking
for
needles
in
--
in
a
haystack,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
schoenfield,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
leiter,
you
briefed
and
argued
this
case
in
support
of
the
judgment
below,
at
the
invitation
of
the
court,
and
have
ably
discharged
that
responsibility,
for
which
we
are
grateful.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-911,
kucana
versus
holder.
