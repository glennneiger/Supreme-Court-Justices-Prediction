ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
iirira
to
reduce
the
burden
that
immigration
cases
imposed,
and
continue
to
impose,
on
the
federal
courts.
the
plain
language
of
the
act
strictly
limits
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
review
the
discretionary
decisions
of
immigration
officials.
in
fact,
as
this
court
has
explained,
the
theme
of
the
legislation
was
to
protect
the
attorney
general's
discretion
from
the
courts.
section
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii)
is
central
to
that
theme.
before
i
discuss
the
language
and
meaning
of
the
section,
i
want
to
make
one
point
very
clear.
the
section
does
not
preclude
judicial
review
of
legal
and
constitutional
claims.
both
of
those
are
expressly
preserved
by
section
1252(a)(2)(d).
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
well,
i
have
--
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
concerned
now
about
taking
away
judicial
review
of
the
really
sort
of
important
central
motions
to
reopen,
that
is
not
a
problem.
with
respect--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--with
respect,
your
honor--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--i
believe
this
court
always
would
have
understood
and
congress
understood
that
its
jurisdiction
strip
would
have
had
an
exception
for
constitutional
claims
even
as
of
1996.
in
1988,
this
court
issued
webster
v.
doe,
finding
that
section
701(a)(2),
which
is
quite
parallel
to
this
provision,
recognizes
certain
claims
as
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law.
congress
--
excuse
me,
this
court
in
1988
recognized
that
provision
as
requiring
a
constitutional
exception.
and
i
think
congress,
acting
in
1996,
would
have
recognized
that
the
same
--
that
there
are
very
similar
language
in
section
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii)
would
also
have
a
constitutional
exception.
i
agree
with
you
that
there
would
not
have
been
a
legal
exception
but
for
the
enactment
of
1252(a)(2)(d).
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
well,
justice
sotomayor,
certainly
had
congress
done
that,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
however,
it
is
not
true
that
the
courts
of
appeals
as
of
that
date
had
been
uniform
in
their
view
that
section
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii)
did
not
extend
to
regulation.
none
had
extended
it
to
motions
to
reopen,
but
in
cdi
services
v.
reno
in
2002,
the
sixth
circuit
recognized
section
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii)
as
extending
to
regulations.
that
was
in
the
context
of
a
--
a
petition
for
a
visa
extension.
and
onyinkwa
v.
ashcroft
in
2004,
the
--
excuse
me
--
eighth
circuit
similarly
recognized
that.
and
then
in
yerkovich
v.
ashcroft
in
the
same
year,
the
eighth
--
excuse
me
--
the
tenth
circuit
also
recognized
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii)
as
extended
to
regulation.
so
the
confusion
plainly
existed
as
of
the
date
of
the
real
idea.
and
i
think
the
burden
was
on
congress,
frankly,
in
that
position,
actually
to
clarify
the
reverse.
if
congress
wanted
to
make
clear
at
that
point--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--with
respect,
your
honor,
it
is
the
same
statute
as
section
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii).
and
they
were
holding
exactly
what
the
seventh
circuit
held
and
what
we
argue
here,
which
is
that
section
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii)
extends
to
things
specified
as
discretionary
in
regulations
issued
under
the
act.
they
had
not
yet
considered
the
issue
with
respect
to
motions
to
reopen,
but
with
respect
to
other
issues
specified
as
discretionary
in
regulation,
they
held
that
the
--
that
the
act
clearly
extended
to
those
issues
and
stripped
the
courts
of
jurisdiction.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
it
does,
your
honor.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
i
believe
there
are
six.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
no,
your
honor.
and
that
appears
to
be
because
the
circuits,
even
the
sixth,
eighth,
and
tenth,
were
persuaded
by
the
existence
of
the
consolidation
provision,
section
1252(b)(6),
but
motions
to
reopen
should
for
some
reason
be
treated
differently
than
other
things
specified
as
discretionary
in
regulations.
but
their--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--they
have
not
repudiated
the
view,
but
they
have
not
adhered
to
it
with
respect
to
motions
to
reopen.
they
seem
to
be
reading
the
statute--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--yes,
they
seem
to
treat
motions
to
reopen
differently
as
reviewable,
and
they
have
been
persuaded
to
do
that
by
the
existence
of
section
1252(b)(6),
the
consolidation
provision.
but
as
i
explained
earlier--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--not
that
i
have
found,
your
honor,
but
nor
have
they
repudiated
it.
i
haven't
found
a
situation
in
which,
after
considering
motions
to
reopen,
they
went
back
again
to
consider
--
these
extensions,
for
example.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
frankly,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
specification
of
discretion
--
with
the
exception
of
the
battered
spouse's
provision
that
you
--
that
you
raised
earlier,
i
do
not
think
the
specification
of
discretion
with
respect
to
other
aspects
of
motions
to
reopen
is
sufficiently
clear
in
the
statute
to
convey
discretion.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
no,
your
honor.
i
think
when
congress
referred
to
a
specification
of
discretion
in
section
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii),
they
intended,
effectively,
to
provide
a
notice
requirement.
there
are
many
things
that
the
attorney
general
did
under
the
immigration
act
prior
to
the
enactment
of
iirira,
after
the
enactment
of
iirira,
that
were
understood
to
be
discretionary.
what
the
statute
calls
for
is
a
different
category
of
discretionary
decisions:
those
things
that
are
specified
as
discretionary
to
be
unreviewable;
other
things
that
have
long
been
understood
to
be
discretionary
remain
reviewable.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
basically.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
that
no
one
includes
congress.
i
think
that
that
--
that
that
line--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--that
line
might
have
made
sense
had
congress
drawn
it,
but
congress--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--the
words
congress
used
here,
though,
are
those
decisions
specified
as
discretionary--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--i
agree,
your
honor,
that
that
category
of
things
is
unreviewable.
what
i'm
struggling
with
is
that
the
regulation
at
issue
here,
regulation
1003.2,
specifies
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
motions
to
reopen
are
discretionary,
and
therefore,
if
"specified
under"
extends
to
regulations,
there
is
no
way
in
my
view
not
to
extend.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
the
language
congress
used
was
clear
here
and
extends
clearly
to
decisions
--
decisions
specified
as
discretionary
under
the
subchapter.
congress
could
easily
have
said
decisions
specified
as
discretionary
in
the
subchapter,
but
it
did
not.
and
in
paragraph--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
description
of
something
as
discretionary
has
consequences
for
the
attorney
general,
for
the
administrative
process.
it
has
only
the
ancillary
consequence
of
stripping
the
courts
of
jurisdiction.
so
court
--
excuse
me,
the
attorney
general
needs
to
determine
a
rule
of
evidence
for
motions
before
it,
needs
to
determine
rules
of
procedure,
needs
to
determine
a
rule
of
decision,
and
so
there
are
--
there
are
categories
of
matters
where
i
could
imagine
congress
saying
to
itself,
the
rule
of
decision
here
is
really
not
something
with
which
we
need
to
concern
ourselves.
it
is
up
to
the
attorney
general
to
decide
whether
this
is
a
discretionary
decision
or
whether
this
is
instead
a
decision
that
he
or
she
would
like
to
--
to
constrain
in
some
way
by
having
certain
specific
rules
of
decision
to
go
by--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--i
will
answer
your
question
first.
i
can
imagine
congress
believing
that
there
are
categories
of
decisions
where
even
the
rules
of
decision
are
best
left
to
the
agency
to
determine.
and
in
that
category
congress
leaves
it
open
to
the
agency
to
decide
whether
to
specify
those
matters
as
discretionary
or
instead
to
specify
more
constraining
rules
of
decision.
with
respect
to
your
question
about
example--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--right.
two
things,
your
honor.
first,
the
jurisdictional
consequence
of
the
discretionary
specification
here
attached
after
the
attorney
general
applied
the
label.
so
here
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
attorney
general
was
making
a
determination
as
to
what
things
should
be
reviewable.
the
attorney
general
was
making
a
--
a
decision
as
to
what
rule
of
decision
to
apply
in
motions
to
reopen,
and
congress
later
attached
the
jurisdictional
significance.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
well,
congress
acted
later
and
may,
if
our
interpretation
is
correct,
have
attached
the
jurisdictional
significance
at
that
point,
yes.
with
respect
to
your
question
about
other
examples
of
situations
in
which
an
agency
is
left
to
make
a
determination
that
has
jurisdictional
consequences,
i
have
a
few
examples.
the
first
is
the
communications
act
of
1934.
this
court
recognized
in
global
crossing
that
the
agency
there
could
determine
that
a
--
that
conduct
under
the
act
was
unreasonable.
that
is
an
administrative
determination
under
one
section
of
the
act.
it
has
the
consequence
under
another
section
of
the
act
of
creating
a
cause
of
action
for
individuals
to
recover
in
damages.
the
second
example
is
actually
section
701(a)(2)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
refers
to
categories
of
decisions
that
are
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law.
courts
have
understood
that
that
is
not
the
broad
subset
of
discretionary
decisions
but
instead
that
subcategory
of
discretionary
decision
for
which
there
is
no
law
to
apply,
and
many
courts
recognize
that
the
agencies
may
create
the
law
to
apply
in
those
circumstances.
so
an
agency
may
enact
a
regulation
that
binds
the
agency's
own
discretion
and
renders
the
issue
reviewable
where
it
would
not
otherwise
have
been.
so
there--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
law
to
apply
in
this
circumstance.
particularly
after
enactment
of
iirira,
congress
now
has
provided
guidelines
for
when
some
motions
to
reopen
should
be
granted,
the
timeliness
of
motions
to
reopen,
et
cetera.
so
i
do
not
think
this
is
the
broad
category
of
--
or
sorry,
the
narrow
category
of
things
that
are
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law.
i
was
using
the
example
solely
to
show
there
are
other
circumstances
in
which
an
agency
action
has
the
consequence
of
restoring--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--yes--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--i
would
love
to
talk
about
under,
your
honor.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
start
on
pages
6a
and
7a.
i
have
an
illustration
here
--
excuse
me,
of
the
--
of
the
government's
opening
brief.
i
have
an
illustration
here
of
the
fact
that
congress
knows
what
it
is
doing
when
it
chooses
prepositions.
if
you
look
at
the
section
that
immediately
precedes
1252(a)(2)(b)(11)
--
that
is
section
1252(a)(2)(a).
in
(a)(2)(a)--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--i'm
sorry.
pages
6a
and
7a
of
the
government's
opening
brief.
so--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--and
pages
6a
and
7a
in
the
appendix.
this
is
--
this
is
provision
1252(a)(2)(a),
and
borrowing
the
term
romanette,
romanette
(i),
(ii)
and
(iv),
refer
clearly
to
things
provided
in
subsection
(e)
in
the
statute
whereas
romanette
(iii)
refers
to
the
application
of
such
section
to
individual
aliens
including
the
determination
made
under
section
1225(b)(1)(b)
of
this
title.
that
is
a
determination
by
immigration
officials
at
the
border
as
to
whether
an
individual
who
is
otherwise
inadmissible
may
have
grounds
to
be
detained
and
go
through
asylum
proceedings.
clearly
there,
where
congress
recognized
that
there
was
an
administrative
determination
to
be
made,
it
used
the
preposition
"under"
to
reach
through
the
statute
to
the
administration
determination.
i
also
have
three
examples,
your
honor,
of
situations
in
chapter
8
in
which
congress
actually
uses
the
phrase
"specified
under",
the
same
phrase
at
issue
here,
to
refer
again
through
the
statute
to
administrative
determinations.
these
are
not
unfortunately
in
the
briefs.
8
u.s.c.
1227
--
excuse
me.
let
me
start
with
8
u.s.c.
1375a(a)(4)
and
(a)(6).
this
is
a
provision
that
calls
for
the
preparation
of
a
pamphlet
on
the
legal
rights
of
immigrant
victims
of
domestic
violence.
paragraph
1375a(a)(6)
calls
for
the
pamphlet
to
be
distributed
and
made
available,
quote
"in
the
language
as
specified
under
paragraph
(4).
"
turning
to
paragraph
(4)
then,
it
clearly
anticipates
an
administrative
determination,
because
it
says
the
secretary
of
homeland
security
in
consultation
with
the
attorney
general
and
the
state
department
shall
determine
at
least
14
languages
into
which
the
pamphlet
is
translated.
so
that's
an
example
of
congress
using
2,
but
it
is
a
situation
in
which
the
statutory
language
to
which
"specified
under"
refers
clearly
anticipates
some
exercise
of
administrative
authority.
here,
the
exercise
of
administrative
authority
is
to
specification
of
languages.
in
our
example,
it
is
the
specification
of
procedures
for
motions
to
reopen.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
your
honor,
subchapter
1
includes
the
language
that
grants
authority
broadly
to
the
attorney
general
to
issue
regulations
implementing
the
chapter,
and
the
language
implemented
by
the
motions
to
reopen
regulations
exists
in
subchapter
2.
the
motion
to
reopen
regulations
very
clearly
implements
section
1229(a),
which
is
in
subchapter
2,
and
a
question
asked
earlier
was
where
one
would
look
to
determine
whether
regulation
1003.2
is
a
valid
regulation,
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
for
that,
i
believe
one
would
have
to
look
at
the
content
of
section
1229(a),
which
is
in
subchapter
2,
so
although--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--yes,
justice
scalia.
i
am
certainly
not--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--yes.
the
phrase
includes
the
word
the
authority,
justice
scalia,
but
i
don't
think
it
can
bear
the
weight
that
petitioner
and
the
government
put
on
it.
i
believe
the
authority
there
references
the
authority
that
is
clearly
granted
in
section
1103
to
implement
the
entire
chapter.
but
what
the
section
does
is
to
indicate
where
the
specification
of
discretion
must
be
located,
and
in
this
case,
it
must
be
located
in
either
the
statute
or
the
regulations
issued
under
it,
and
to
see
that,
i
think
the
easiest
illustration
is
to
suppose
that
the
statute
read:
no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
review
any
decision
specified
as
discretionary
--
excuse
me
--
decision,
the
authority
for
which
is
specified
as
discretionary
in
the
subchapter
or
in
regulations
issued
thereunder.
if
congress
had
used
belts
and
suspenders
in
that
way
and
made
itself
doubly
clear,
there
would
be
no
question
here
that
the
word
"authority"
was
somehow
superfluous
or
misplaced.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
the
--
the
best
answer
i
have,
justice
breyer,
is
that
congress
wanted
to
cut
off
review
at
some
point,
and
it
was
a
question
of
numbers
of
bites
at
the
apple.
i
understand
your
point,
that
--
that--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--and
that
may
have
been
part
of
congress's
concern,
that,
of
course,
by
and
large,
it's
supposed
to
be,
but
it
may
not
always
be
used
in
that
way,
and,
at
some
point,
congress
wanted
to
draw
the
line,
and
i
note
here
that
congress
did
not
--
i
mean
what
congress
did
here
was
to
set
up
a
regime
under
which
things
that
are
specified
as
discretionary
are
unreviewable.
but
there
is
some
room
here
for
the
attorney
general
to
remove
the
specification
of
discretion
if
that
system
is
unlawful--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--certainly,
your
honor.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
well,
the
math
that
we
were
given
earlier,
i
believe,
does
come
out
to
about
2,000
appeals
per
year,
but
i
remind
the
court
that
section
1252(a)(2)(d)
preserves
those
that
raise
questions
of
law
or
constitutional
questions
for
review.
so
this
is
a
far
narrower
--
i
assume,
although
i
do
not
have
the
numbers,
but
i
assume
a
far
narrower
subset
of
those
decisions
that
would
be
rendered
unreviewable
here,
only
those
for
which
a
discretionary
factual
determination
has
been
made
by
the
agency.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
i
don't
have
the
numbers,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
percent.
i
am
not
sure
whether
it's
a
fraction
of
the
haystack
or
a
needle
within
it,
but
--
but
it
is
certainly
a
subset
of
the
--
of
the
category
of
cases.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
justice
ginsburg,
we
included
the
appendix
to
illustrate
how
congress
uses
the
preposition
under,
when
it
is
talking
about
regulations,
so
we
specifically
looked
for
examples
where
congress
was
talking
already
about
regulations,
and
the
preposition
that
accompanies
that
is
always
under.
i
do
have--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--i
have--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--thank
you,
justice
scalia.
the
other
two
are
section
1227(a)(1)(h),
which
refers
to
1182(a)(5)(a),
1227(a)(1)(h),
both
in
chapter
8,
refers
to
grounds
of
inadmissibility
--
excuse
me
--
specified
under
paragraph
(5)(a)
of
section
1182(a).
turning
to
paragraph
(5)(a)
of
section
1182(a),
that
calls
for
the
labor
department
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
needs
immigrant
laborers
in
a
particular
category.
so,
again,
it's
a
use
of
the
phrase
"specified
under"
to
refer
to
statutory
language,
but
through
the
statutory
language
to
what
is
clearly
an
anticipated
exercise
of
administrative
discretion.
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
okay.
the
third
one
is
section
--
again,
chapter
8,
section
1537(b)(1)
and
(b)(2).
(b)(1)
says
that,
after
judicial
review
affirming
a
removal
order,
the
attorney
general
"shall
remove
the
alien
to
a
country
2.
"
and
then,
in
paragraph
2,
the
statute
says
that
the
alien
may
choose
the
country,
but
that
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
to
review
the
alien's
choice
of
country,
and
if
the
alien
refuses
to
choose
a
country,
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
to
specify
the
country.
the
first--
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
--1375(a)
--
(a)(4)
and
(a)(6).
ms.
amanda
c.
leiter
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor?
