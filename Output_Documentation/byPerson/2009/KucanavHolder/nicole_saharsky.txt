ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
at
issue
does
not
bar
judicial
review
of
denials
of
motions
to
reopen.
and
i
would
like
to
go
right
to
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
by
justice
scalia,
which
is:
how
do
you
make
sense
out
of
this
statute,
in
terms
of
what
congress
is
doing
in
not
allowing
judicial
review
of
specifications
of
discretion
in
regulations,
but
--
i'm
sorry,
and
allowing
judicial
review
of
things
that
are
specified
in
regulations,
but
not
things
that
are
specified
in
the
subchapter?
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
this
question
comes
from
the
text
of
the
statute,
particularly
if
you
compare
the
two
things
that
are
in
1252(a)(2)(b)(i)
and
(ii),
that
all
of
the
things
that
are
listed
in
(i)
and
that
are
covered
by
(ii)
are
subsumate
decisions
that
are
made
by
the
executive
in
the
immigration
context
as
a
matter
of
grace,
things
that
involve
whether
aliens
can
stay
in
the
country
or
not.
and
those
are
matters,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
that
the
executive,
in
the
exercise
of
its
immigration
and
foreign
affairs
power,
has
the
authority
to
decide
and
that
congress
did
not
want
the
federal
courts
in
the
business
of
reviewing.
but
what
the
federal
courts
have
often
reviewed
are
things
where
discretion
is
committed
by
regulation,
and
these
are
procedural
matters
that
relates
to
whether
an
alien
had
a
fair
shot
of
getting
his
claim
heard
by
the
agency
and
by
the
federal
courts.
things
like--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
would
say
that
the
attorney
general
has
the
discretion
to
issue
regulations
with
regard
to--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes,
because
the
statute--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--no.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
because
in
the
case
that
you
are
positing,
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
is
implicit
in
the
statute.
it's
not
specified
in
the
statute.
and
here,
congress
didn't
say
any
time
there
is
a
discretionary
decision,
which
is
what
implicit
discretion
would
go
to.
it
says:
when
discretionary
authority
is
specified.
under
this
subchapter,
that
means
that
there
needs
to
be
something
specific,
specified,
explicit,
specifically
noted
in
the
text
of
the
statute--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
right.
that
wouldn't
be
reviewable.
congress
viewed
the
language
of
discretion--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
that
that
is
like
the
--
the
various
matters
that
congress
listed
as
specified
as
discretionary
within
the
text
of
the
relevant
subchapter,
that
it
decided
that
this
was
a
matter
of
executive
grace
that
it
did
not
want
the
federal
courts
involved
in.
but
the
federal
courts
have
long
reviewed
things
like
denials
of
motions
to
reopen,
continuance
denials,
where
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
federal
courts
wanted
to
make
sure
that
aliens
were
getting
a
fair
chance
to
have
their
claims
heard--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--two
answers,
your
honor.
first,
the
standard
review
here
is
abuse
of
discretion.
it
has
long
been
abuse
of
discretion.
that
doesn't
mean
the
federal
courts
are
involved
in
second-guessing--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
don't
think
you
are.
if
i
am
understanding
you
correctly,
we
actually
have
a
footnote
in
our
opening
brief
where--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
let
me
try
to
explain.
there
are
a
number
of
matters
that
are
committed
to
the
agency's
discretion
after
(i),
things
like
adjustment
of
status.
and
if
the
alien
sought
review,
judicial
review,
of
an
adjustment
of
status
determination,
we
would
say
that's
unreviewable
under
--
under
(i).
let's
say
that
he
then
files
a
motion
to
reopen.
well,
he
is
essentially
trying
to
relitigate
his
adjustment
of
status.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
is
if
what
he's
challenging
is
a
discretionary
determination
that
the
executive
has
already
made,
that
that
motion
to
reopen
would
not
be--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--if
something
new
came
up--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
certainly
that's
what
the
statute
requires
them
to
do.
it's
not
our
experience
that
every
case
that's
filed
is
that
way.
but
in
your
hypothetical,
when
something
new
comes
up,
we
understand
congress
as
have
--
wanting
that
to
have
been
judicially
reviewable.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
because
congress
wants
to
make
sense
that
the
alien
is
getting
--
make
sure
that
the
alien
is
getting
a
fair
shot
in
terms
of
the
process.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
if
what
he's
seeking
is
a
review
of
an
exercise
of
discretion,
then
that
is
not
reviewable,
because
of
the
reason
that
the
initial
determination
is
not
reviewable--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
difference
there
is
between
a
substantive
determination
that's
a
matter
of
grace
and
a
procedural
determination
to
make
sure
that
an
alien
gets
a
fair
shot,
and--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
of
course
we
believe
that
the
board
can
be
trusted,
and
that's
why
review
is
for
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
it
has
been
for
many
years.
this
court
has
said
in
dada--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
right,
but
we
did
not
argue
to
the
seventh
circuit
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
here.
in
fact,
it
has
been
our
position
since
2004
that
the
text
of
this
statute,
particularly
the
text,
the
context,
the
history,
is
so
clear
that
we
could
not
reasonably
take
the
alternate
position
in--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there
are
only
a
handful
of
cases,
and
in
those
cases,
several
individual
attorneys
argued
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
and
as
soon
as
the
leadership
of
the
office
of
immigration
litigation
heard
of
those
cases,
it
sat
down
with
the
text
of
the
statute
and
said:
we
think
that
the
text
here
is
clear,
and
we
don't
think
the
jurisdiction
is
taken
away.
and
it
directed
all
of
the
attorneys
in
the
office
of
immigration
and
litigation
not
to
be
making
this
jurisdiction-stripping
argument
any
more.
and
it
has
been
the
united
states's
consistent
position
since
then,
and
we
urged
it
to
the
seventh
circuit
below,
that
when
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
you
look
at
authorities
specified
under
this
subchapter.
it
is
congress
that
specifies
authority.
"specified
under
this
subchapter"
means
"in
this
subchapter".
it
means
"in
the
text
of
the
subchapter.
"
and
we
have
to
answer
this
question
in
this
case
by
looking
at
the
text
that
congress
enacted.
i
acknowledge
that
there
is
not
legislative
history,
for
example,
to
tell
us
what
congress
intended
to
do
here,
but
we
think
that
the
answer
comes
from
the
text
of
the
statute.
that
if
you
are
looking
at
the
substantive
determinations
that
congress
was
most
concerned
about
in
1996
when
it
enacted
iirira,
those
were
the
things
where
executive
discretion
was
exercised.
it
did
not
want
the
federal
courts
getting
involved
in--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
there
are
approximately
between
8
and
10,000
motions
to
reopen
filed
by
the
board
of
--
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
each
year,
and
about
between
15
and
20
percent
of
those
are
granted.
so
if
you
look
at
the
--
the
remaining
80
to
85
percent
that
are
denied,
the
general
appeal
rate
for
the
courts
of
appeals
is
about
30
percent
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
so
if
you
assume
that
the
appeal
rate
is
about
the
same
for
motions
to
reopen,
you
could
get
a
number
that
way.
so,
you
know,
we
--
there
are
a
substantial
number
of--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--but
the
--
the
point
that
we
are
making
is
that
there
are
these
circumstances
that
congress
has
recognized,
and
this
court
recognized
it
in
dada.
the
motions
to
reopen
serve
several
important
purposes,
and,
yes,
they
are
reviewed
under
a
very
deferential
abuse-of-discretion
standard.
we
do
not
think
in
many
cases
that
the
board
was
doing
something
wrong
and
that
it
needs
to
be
overturned.
but,
for
example,
in
the
--
in
a
similar
context
of
continuance
denials,
say
there
was
an
immigration
judge
who
did
not
allow
an
alien
to
seek
a
continuance
in
order
to
get
an
attorney
to
bring
forth
his
case
before
the
immigration
judge.
continuance
denials,
some
circuits,
including
the
seventh
circuit,
have
said,
are
barred
under
this
language.
we
don't
think
that
judicial
review
of
that
is
barred.
we
think
that
in
the
rare
case--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
--
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
a
question
of
law
in
that
circumstance.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
the
courts
have
long
served
a
very
important
check
on
the
board's
authority
and
on
the
board's
exercise,
and
the
board
has
many
cases
before
it.
in
rare
instances,
the
federal
courts--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes,
that's
right,
but
the
statute
also
--
the
attorney
general
--
the
board
acts
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
under
the
statute,
so
the
board--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
right.
the
attorney
general
does
police
the
board,
but
the
courts
of
appeals
have
long
done
that
too,
particularly
in
the
context
of
motions
to
reopen.
this
court,
just
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
dada,
recognized
the
important
functions
that
motions
to
reopen
serve
and
assumed
that
there
would
be
judicial
review
of
motions
to
reopen.
in
fact,
it
noted
that
judicial
review
of
motions
to
reopen,
albeit
under
the
abuse-of-discretion
standards,
goes
back
to
1916,
and
we
just
didn't
see
anything
in
1996
that
suggests
that
congress
wanted
to
change
that.
and
i
think--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--before
the
bia
existed,
so
back
in
the
1916
context,
there
were
immigration
officers,
and
you
could
ask
them
to
reconsider
or
reopen
your
case.
in
--
i
think
it
was
1940
or
1941,
the
board
came
into
being,
and
the
attorney
general
quickly
enacted
regulations
that
provided
for
either
a
sua
sponte
reopening
or
for
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
reopen.
and
those
regulations
existed
in
substantially
the
same
form
until
1996,
when
they
were
amended
to
make
discretion
explicit
in
the
regulation,
and
the
1996
is
essentially
the
same
form
that
it
is
in
today.
so
there
has
--
there
has
always
been
an
assumption
that
there
could
be
such
a
thing
as
reopening.
and
i
--
i
just
want
to
focus
on
what
congress
was
doing
in
1996,
because
i
think
it's
very
telling.
we
know
that
congress
was
focused
on
enacting
bars
to
judicial
review,
and
we
also
know
that
congress
was
codifying
for
the
first
time
an
alien's
right
to
file
one
motion
to
reopen.
but
congress
just
didn't
make
any
effort
to
make
denials
of
motions
to
reopen
judicially
unreviewable,
and
that's
very
telling,
because
there
is
any
number
of
ways
that
congress
could
have
done
that.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
you
know,
i
--
i
haven't
done
the
math
on
that,
either,
and
i
think
it
requires
the
assumptions
that
i
set
out--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
--
i
don't,
because
we
haven't
calculated
the
number
of
motions
throughout,
and
we
only
have
total
numbers
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
but
let
me
say,
if
you
are
concerned
about
the
burden
on
the
courts
of
appeals,
every
court
but
the
seventh
circuit
that
has
considered
the
issue
has
found
that
the
provision
at
issue
doesn't
bar
judicial
review.
so
i
don't
think
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
you
would
know
better
than
i
would.
we
ask
the
judgment
below
to
be
reversed.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
this
is
comprehensively
addressed
in
footnote
18
in
our
reply
brief,
so
i
will
just
address
it
briefly
here,
but
if
you
have
follow-up
questions
--
which
is:
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
language,
it
says
that
an
alien
may
file
one
motion
to
reopen.
it
doesn't
limit
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
allow
more
than
one
motion
to
reopen
in
certain
circumstances.
and,
in
fact,
it--
