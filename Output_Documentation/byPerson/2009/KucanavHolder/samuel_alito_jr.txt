justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
didn't
do
the
math
fast
enough
in
my
head
when
you
were
answering
justice
kennedy's
question,
but
is
he
correct
that
the
effect
of
accepting
your
argument
is
about
2,000
additional
appeals
that
--
that
the
department
of
justice
will
have
to
brief
and
the
courts
of
appeals
will
have
to
decide?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
the
assumptions
that
you
made,
do
you
know
what
the
--
the
result
is?
