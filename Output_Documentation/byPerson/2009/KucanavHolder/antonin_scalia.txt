justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
--
how
does
that
read?
i
--
i
recall
the
briefs
say
that,
but
i
don't
recall
reading
it.
is
it
--
does
it
appear
somewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the
provision
that
--
that
you
contend
provides
the
authority
for
the
attorney
general's
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
where
is
it,
i'm
asking?
is
it
--
is
it
in
the
brief
somewhere?
you
know,
it's
nice
to
know
what
we
are
talking
about.
when
--
when
you
are
relying
on
a
section,
it
would
be
nice
to
have
it
in
the
materials.
i
mean,
i
guess
i
could
send
for
it,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it
really
doesn't
matter
what
"under"
means,
right?
i
mean,
even
--
even
if
you
accept
the
other
interpretation
of
"under",
to
wit,
that
it
includes
regulations
pursuant
to
the
subchapter,
your
point
is
that
this
regulation
is
not
even
pursuant
to
the
subchapter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
would
it
--
i
don't
--
the
big
obstacle
i
find
with
your
position
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
why
would
congress
want
to
exclude
review
for
discretionary
judgments
by
the
attorney
general
that
are
recited
explicitly
to
be
discretionary
in
the
statute,
but
provide
judicial
review
for
judgments
that
are
just
as
lawfully
discretionary
because
the
attorney
general
is
given
the
authority
to
make
them
discretionary
and
has
done
so?
i
mean,
a
discretionary
judgment
is
a
discretionary
judgment.
why
--
at
least
if
it's
a
legitimate
one,
i
can
understand
why
you
would
say
discretion
which
is
given
to
the
attorney
general
under
the
statute,
as
opposed
to
discretion
which
he
has
wrongfully
assumed,
but
--
but
both
--
both
exercises
of
discretion
are
just
as
lawful,
right,
under
the
statute?
one
is
explicit
in
the
statute,
and
the
other
is
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
make
it
discretionary.
why
would
congress
want
the
one
to
be
subject
to
judicial
review
and
not
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
i'm
saying:
why
is
it
a
rational
line
to
say
--
i
think
it's
a
rational
line
to
say,
when
lawful
discretion
is
being
exercised,
since
it's
a
discretionary
judgment,
you're
not
entitled
to
it
anyway,
and
therefore,
we
won't
review
it.
that
makes
some
sense.
and
i
--
but
where
discretion
is
lawfully
exercised,
why
would
--
why
would
congress
go,
oh,
when
the
discretion
is
lawfully
exercised
because
the
statute
says
so,
we
have
one
approach,
but
where
discretion
is
lawfully
exercised
only
because
the
statute
allows
the
attorney
general
to
prescribe
discretion,
we
will
not
allow?
i
don't
understand
why
--
why
it
would
want
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
--
you
don't
--
you
don't
contest
that
the
regulation
can
provide
discretion.
you
--
you
don't
say
the
regulation
is
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
a
valid
exercise
of
discretion,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
adhered
--
have
those
other
courts
that
you
said
originally
said
that
other
discretionary
judgments
made
discretionary
by
regulation
were
non-reviewable,
have
they
adhered
to
the
--
to
that
view
as
to
those
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
understand.
i
am
asking:
have
they
treated
motions
to
reopen
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
any
of
them,
since
switching
to
--
or
since
holding
this
with
respect
to
motions
to
reopen,
reaffirmed
their
view
with
regard
to
other
discretionary
judgments?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
talk
about
"under"?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
government's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
that
the
text
refers
not
just
to
the
--
the
discretion,
it
refers
--
it
says
the
authority
for
which
is
specified
under
this
subchapter
and
the
authority
to
issue
that
--
the
authority
to
issue
the
regulation
is
under
subchapter
1.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
you
would
have
to
say,
no,
justice
scalia,
if
you
want
to
win
this.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
of
course,
if
your
interpretation
produces
the
anomaly
that
justice
breyer
just
described,
the
government's
interpretation
produces
the
opposite
anomaly.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said,
earlier,
that
you
had
three
examples--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
were
not
in
your
brief.
you
better
spit
them
out,
or
we
won't
know
about
them.
what
are
the
other
two?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
1227(a)(1)(h).
what
is
the
third
one?
and
then
i
am
going
to
ask
you
what
the
first
one
was
because
i
forgot
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
what
was
the
first
one?
just
--
just
give
me
the
--
the
cite
for
the
first
one.
i
didn't
write
it
down.
i
should
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
