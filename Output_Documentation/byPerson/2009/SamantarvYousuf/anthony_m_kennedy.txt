justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
i
--
i
want
to
just
say
that
i
have
one
problem
with
the
case
at
the
outset.
and
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
the
organization
of
your
argument.
you
might
want
to
address
it
later.
and
it's
a
question
that
goes
to
the
other
counsel,
too.
i'm
having
difficulty
seeing
how
the
issues
as
presented
in
the
brief
really
resolve
very
much.
let's
assume
--
i
know
this
is
not
your
position.
let's
assume
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
grants
immunity
to
the
state
for
this
conduct
and
for
a
then-serving
official
who
is
its
agent
and
for
a
former
agent.
let's
assume
there
is
--
there
is
immunity.
why
isn't
it
just
repealed,
overridden,
by
the
later
enactment
of
the
torture
victims
protection
act?
i
just
don't
see
the
issue
structured
that
way
in
the
briefs,
and
i'm
puzzled
by
it.
but
i
say
that
at
the
outset,
and
i
really
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
your
--
your
good
introduction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
case
authority
do
you
have
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
like
a
--
it's
like
a
clear
statement
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
that
--
again,
the
torture
victim
protection
act
says
"an
individual
who,
under
actual
or
apparent
authority,
or
under
color
of
law
of
any
foreign
nation,
subjects
an
individual
to
torture.
"
why
isn't
that
a
clear
statement?
and
then
i'll
get
off
this
hobby
horse,
and
you
can
get
back
to
talking
about
the
fsia.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
then
i
--
i
had
thought
--
again,
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
that,
ultimately,
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
within
the
issues
here
present
--
ultimately,
you
have
two
arguments.
one
is
that
it's
just
implicit,
inherent,
necessary
for
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
that
agents
be
covered;
otherwise
it
won't
work.
the
other
--
i
take
it
you
have
a
backup
position
that
even
if
that's
wrong,
that
under
generally
accepted
principles
of
international
law,
that
agents
still
have
immunity.
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
thought
when
i
read
the
house
of
lords
opinion
in
jones
and
they
talked
about
the
statute,
that
they
took
your
position,
this
first
position,
that
the
act
just
won't
work
unless
there's
an
agent
--
immunity
for
the
agent.
but
i
take
it
that
even
if
we
reject
that
position,
you
still
have
a
fallback
position
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
further
proceedings
on
remand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
red
light
has
gone
off.
i
could
just
add
--
make
an
addition
to
that
same
question.
i
would
agree
that
the
state
department
might
have
some
expertise
in
telling
us
what
the
facts
were:
who
was
the
government,
who
was
--
who
was
in
office
at
the
time,
what
the
policies
were.
but
it's
just
not
clear
to
me
what
body
of
principles
the
state
department
looks
to,
to
make
this
determination
that,
as
justice
scalia
said,
smith
is
immune
and
jones
isn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
with
reference
to
the
indictment
against
the
secretary
of
defense,
is
that
that's
not
covered
by
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
and
if
a
state
interprets
international
law
to
allow
the
suit,
then
it
goes
forward.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
just
goes
back
to
the
tate
letter
era,
where
we
wait
to
get
an
e-mail
from
the
state
department
to
tell
us
what
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
the
federal
--
of
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
