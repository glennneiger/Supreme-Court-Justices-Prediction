mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text,
the
context,
the
purposes,
and
legislative
history
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
demonstrate
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
the
preexisting
common
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--doctrine
of
official
immunity,
but
rather
--
yes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first,
there's
--
there
is
a
very
practical
distinction
between
suing
the
state
and
suing
the
individual.
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
is
not
just
about
immunity;
it's
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
courts.
if
a
foreign
sovereign
is
found
to
be
immune,
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
so
to
say
that
the
individual
is
--
is
governed
by
the
fsia
means
that
it
would
be
a
threshold
subject
matter
jurisdictional
inquiry
in
every
case.
so
in
terms
of
judicial
administration,
that
is
a
problem.
it
is
also
a
problem,
as
a
practical
matter,
to
apply
the
fsia's
very
reticulated
standards
that
were
carefully
negotiated
between
the
executive
branch
and
congress
when
they
knew
what
they
were
dealing
with.
they
were
dealing
with
the
immunity
of
states
and
the
--
and
the
principals
of
states.
and
this
is
reflected,
as
ms.
millett
said,
in
section
1602.
that's
the
business
that
congress
wanted
to
get
--
congress
and
the
executive
--
wanted
the
executive
to
be
out
of,
which
was
the
immunity
of
foreign
states--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--okay.
and
--
right
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
--
i
don't
regard
the
position
as
extreme
at
all.
it's
exactly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
is
a
statute
that
invaded
the
common
law
in
the
--
the
background
was
the
common
law
in
which
the
executive
made
the
determinations
for
both
foreign
sovereigns
and
individual
officials.
this
--
and
in
addition,
it
--
it
affected
the
relationship
of
the
political
branches.
it
had
been
a
power
of
the
executive
branch
for
foreign
sovereigns.
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
took
that
away
with
the
agreement
of
the
political
branches.
there's
none
of
--
there's
no
indication
whatsoever
that
congress
addressed
common
law
immunities,
and
there's
a
good
reason.
and
that
is
that
there
--
there
are
a
lot
of
diplomatic
sensitivities
about
whether
immunity
should
be
recognized
in
a
particular
case
or
not.
and
with
respect
to
foreign
sovereigns,
the
political
branches
addressed
those
in
very
precise
ways.
there's
nothing
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
to
take
into
account
the
different
sensitivities
that
might
well
arise
with
respect
to
foreign
sovereigns--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
would
--
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
--
and
it
would
--
here's
one
example
in
which
it
would
work:
if
the
relief
was
going
to
run
against
the
state,
if
there
was
an
injunction
to
take
money
out
of
the
state
treasury
or
to
convey
land,
for
example,
that
would,
in
substance,
be
an
action
against
the
state,
just
like
under
ex
parte
young.
if
you
tried
to
bring
an
injunction
against
a
state
officer
to
make
him
pay
money
out
of
the
state
treasury,
you
couldn't
do
that.
it's
not
because
the
officer
being
sued
is
the
state.
it's
that
the
state
is
a
necessary
party
to
that
lawsuit.
the
state
not
being
joined,
the
suit
against
the
individual
would
have
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
pimentel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
--
there
--
there
is
a
difference
in
the
operation
of
the
suit.
we're
not
saying
that
such
an
official
should
not
be
immune.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
immunity
derives
from
the
common
law
immunity.
there's
a
presumption
against
a
statute
invading
the
common
law,
and
particularly
a
common
law
that
was
primarily
shaped
by
the
executive.
there
should
be
a
strong
presumption
against
taking
that
flexibility
away
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement
in
the
statute.
and
as
--
and
--
if
the
--
if
a
--
if
a
suit
should
go
to
judgment
like
that,
perhaps
the
state
would
indemnify
the
person.
but
we
are
not
saying
that
that
person
is
not
immune.
a
question
that
was
asked--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
to
the
--
and
--
and
i
--
i
understand
the
practical
problem
that
the
district
court
faced,
and
the
district
court
was
very
patient.
i
think
it's
important
to
appreciate,
though,
the
--
the
--
this
case
really
illustrates
the
sensitivities
of
--
of
foreign
official
immunity.
this
is
--
this
is
a
claim
of
foreign
official
immunity
by
a
former
official
of
a
collapsed
state
in
a
--
in
somalia,
as
some
of
the
briefs
point
out.
there
has
not
been
a
functioning
central
government
since
1991.
there
are
a
number
of
factions.
on
the
ground
in
somalia,
the
absence
of
a
central
government
has
led
to
foreign
governments
coming
in
and
exercising
influence,
to
domestic
terrorist
groups,
and
to
piracy
off
the
--
off
the
coast
of
somalia.
the
request
to
the
united
states,
to
the
state
department
for
its
views,
arose
in
that
context.
this
very
case
at
this
moment
arises
in
a
context
where
things
are
fluid,
and
--
and
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
executive
branch
or
sometimes
even
the
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
--
such
a
suit
would
not
be
perfectly
okay
in
--
because,
i
mean,
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
but
as
was
pointed
out
with
respect
to
the
suits
against
the
two
israeli
defense
ministers,
in
that
circumstance,
the
israeli
government
said,
listen,
these
two
officers
were
acting
on
behalf
of
--
of
the
government
when
they
carried
--
that's
the
dichter
case
and
the
--
and
the
case
this
court
had
from
the
second
circuit
last
term.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
under
international
law
the
--
the
official
immunity
exists
for
the
benefit
of
the
state,
not
for
the
individual.
the
state
can
waive
that
immunity,
and
the
state
can
determine
whether,
as
happened
in
the
philippines
case,
that
the
--
that
the
actions
being
complained
of
were
not
--
were
not
within
the
official
activity.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
if
--
if
--
if
one
of
our
officials
was
sued
in
a
foreign
court,
then
we
would
expect
the
dynamic
to
play
out
as
--
as
i
have
described,
where
the
united
states
would
take
the
position,
presumably
that
what
was
being
done
was
within
the
scope
of
official
conduct
after
investigation
and
assert
immunity,
and
expect
that
to
be
respected.
my
only
point
is
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
the
--
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
--
it
was
the
purpose
with
respect
to
foreign
sovereigns,
but
there
were
good
reasons
why
the
court
did
that,
precisely
because
immunity
questions
--
as
i've
said,
this
case
illustrates,
to
--
to
recognize
an
immunity
or
not
to
recognize
would
--
might
favor
one
faction
or
another
in
the
ongoing
dispute
in
--
in
somalia.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
so
the
--
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
are
not
addressing
that
here.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
consideration
of
common
law
head
of
state
and
other
immunities.
suggestions
of
immunity
traditionally
have
been
tendered
to
the
district
court.
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
shows
--
clearly
says
that
the
official
type
immunities
--
using
the
word
"official"
immunity,
head
of
state
immunity,
diplomatic
immunity,
consular
immunity
--
those
things
are
not
addressed
by
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
section
--
section
1602
shows
that
congress
wanted
to
take
the
executive
away
because
the
government
was
being
pressured
by
foreign
governments
with
respect
to
the
restrictive
theory
with
respect
to
commercial
activities.
and
that's
where
the
pressure
was
being
applied,
and
the
executive
branch
wanted
to
get
out
of
that
business,
and
agreed
to.
if
you
read
1602,
it
specifically
refers
to
commercial
activities.
there
was
no
such
conscious
abrogation
of
the
executive's
critical
role
to
make
immunity
determinations
on
behalf
of
officials
in
the
legislative
history.
and
this
court
should
not
strain
to
read
the
rigid
provisions
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
which
were
just
not
tailored
to
the
immunities
that
the
underhill
decision
of
this
court
specifically
said
officials
have
immunity
for
their
official
acts
exercising
governmental
authority.
