correct
in

that
you
do
not
contend
that

was
covered

you
do
make
that
argument
in

then?

it's
interesting
that
nobody
has
talked
about
that
section
during
the
entire
argument.

if
they
don't
qualify
under
1603(b)(1),
it's
kind
of
hard
to
get
the
statute
to
apply
to
them
at
all.

1602

justice
john

the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
a
high-level
government
official
in
somalia
in
the
1980s.
he
fled
somalia
in
1991
and
now
resides
in
the
united
states.
respondents
are
natives
of
somalia
who
allege
that
they
or
members
of
their
families
were
the
victims
of
torture
and
extrajudicial
killings
in
somalia.
they
sued
petitioner
for
damages
based
on
his
role
in
their
persecution.
the
district
court
dismissed
respondents'
lawsuit
on
the
ground
that
petitioner
was
immune
from
suit
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
that
act
provides
that
a
“foreign
state”
is
immune
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
courts
unless
of
one
of
--
unless
one
of
the
exceptions
in
the
act
applies.
it
defines
foreign
state
to
include
in
“agency
or
instrumentality”
of
foreign
state.
the
district
court
concluded
that
a
foreign
official
acting
in
his
official
capacity
as
petitioner
did
here
was
covered
by
the
immunity
that
the
act
extends
to
foreign
states,
because
the
foreign
official
was
an
agency
or
instrumentality
of
the
state.
respondents
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
the
act
does
not
apply
to
individual
officials
of
a
foreign
state.
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
the
act
does
not
govern
petitioners
claim
to
immunity
from
suit
and
his
claim
to
immunity
is
instead
governed
by
the
common
law
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
we
granted
certiorari
to
reserve
–
to
resolve
the
circuit
split
on
the
issue.
based
on
our
review
of
the
text,
purpose
and
legislative
history
of
the
act,
we
conclude
that
it
does
not
govern
the
termination
of
a
foreign
official's
claim
to
immunity.
whether
petitioner
may
be
entitled
to
immunity
under
the
common
law,
is
a
matter
to
be
addressed
in
the
first
instance
on
remand.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
judgment
is
unanimous,
but
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
