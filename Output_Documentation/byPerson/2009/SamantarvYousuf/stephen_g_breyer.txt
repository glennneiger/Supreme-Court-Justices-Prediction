justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
the
--
the
department
of
the
army
orders
clothes
for
the
soldiers
at
a
time
when
the
department
is
a
separate
agency
of
government
x
in
1940.
in
1950,
this
department
is
bought
by
the
dior
clothing
company.
now,
it's
a
private
entity,
and
someone
would
like
to
sue
the
department
because
they
didn't
pay
the
bill.
it
is
now
a
private
entity.
they
are
suing
them
for
what
happened
years
ago
when
they
were
part
of
the
state.
is
it
sovereign
immunity,
this
statute
that
blocks
the
suit,
or
some
other
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
statute
would
block
the
suit.
there's
precedent
with
--
you
know,
famous
precedent
with
king
farouk,
which
says
the
opposite.
it
says:
you
were
king,
you
are
not
king
now;
therefore,
there
may
be
a
different
principle,
but
we
can
sue
you
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
you're
saying
if
a
state
disappears,
it
no
longer
exists,
so
you
couldn't
possibly
be
interfering.
you
couldn't
possibly
be
interfering
in
the
workings
of
the
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
still
can't
sue
anybody--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
was
part
of
the
official
operation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
though
there
is
no
present
interference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
if
the
state
doesn't
exist,
why
is
there
any
stronger
reason
than
in
the
incident
where
the
entity
is
no
longer
part
of
the
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
you
may
have
act
of
state
doctrine.
at
that
point,
the
state
department
comes
in
and
says:
you
can't
maintain
this
suit
because
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
for
the
very
reason
you've
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
my
question:
do
you
need
the
act
of
state
doctrine
or
does
this
statute
cover
it
which
removes
the
discretion
from
the
executive
branch
to
decide
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
the
question
i
think,
as
i
understand
it,
which
is
certainly
why
it's
bothering
me,
is:
don't
think
of
this
case.
think
of
the
set
of
cases
where
it's
clear
that
the
plaintiff
is
suing
an
active
state.
he's
suing
france
or
he's
suing
england
or
--
he's
suing
an
active
state
for
an
official
act.
and
the
judge
says:
i
have
read
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act;
dismissed.
judge,
let
me
amend
this.
and
all
he
does
is
he
fills
in
the
names
of
the
individuals,
because
there
were
some
individuals
who
did
the
act.
now,
does
he
suddenly
fall
outside
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
just
because
he
listed
the
names
of
the
people
who
did
it,
and
everything
else
was
the
same?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
this
act
does
nothing
whatsoever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
doesn't
protect--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
state,
because
all
i
did
there
is
i
made
my
complaint
the
same,
relief
was
the
same,
everything
was
the
same.
i
happened
to
go
to
the
internet
to
find
out
who
were
the
human
beings
working
for
the
state
who
did
the
thing
i'm
complaining
did.
and
all
i
did
was
fill
their
names
in,
in
the
complaint.
and
i
cannot
imagine
any
complaint
that
isn't
open
to
that,
because
a
--
a
state
can
only
act
through
an
individual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
wait--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
saying
this
act
is
only
good
as
against
a
bad
lawyer?
because
any
good
lawyer
would
simply
fill
in
the
right
names.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
never
a
case
where
this
act
would
give
immunity
if
the
plaintiff
has
a
good
lawyer.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
oh,
that's
a
different
answer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
if
you're
going
to
give
that
answer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
i
thought
was
what
you
would
give--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
i
have
added
my
question:
sometimes
the
individual,
in
the
first
set
of
cases
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned,
does
count
as
the
state.
sometimes
the
individual
does
not
count
as
the
state.
and
the
trouble
i'm
having,
in
this
case,
is
to
work
out
the
principle
of
when
that
individual
would
fall
within
the
fsia
--
as
you
now,
via
justice
ginsburg,
have
conceded,
sometimes
it
does
--
and
when
it
doesn't.
and
i've
tried
to
work
with
the
idea
of
relief,
or
maybe
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action,
or
maybe
the
time
that
the
suit
is
brought,
such
as
a
time
afterwards.
i'm
not
an
expert.
you're
more
of
an
expert
than
i.
what
are
the
principles
that
determine
when?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
that
--
i
mean,
i'm
sort
of
there.
you
may
agree
with
this,
that
if
you
have
an
individual
and
with
what's
being
charged
here
is
he
is,
in
fact,
now
acting
as
secretary
of
defense,
and
this
action
is
an
action
he
took
in
his
official
capacity,
that's
it.
forget
it.
this
act
covers
it.
but
where
you're
claiming
it's
not
and
he's
not
now
a
member,
the
reason
for
the
act
disappears,
and
you
go
back
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
all
you
have
to
do
is
write
a
different
word
in.
now,
that's
the
question
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
then
ms.
millett
sort
of
backed
off
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
--
and
if
--
what
i'm
seeing
here
is
two
extreme
positions.
you're
saying:
never,
no
matter
what,
can
you
simply
write
the
name
"joe
smith"
under
the
word
"niger".
okay?
can't
do
it.
even
though
every
act
--
no
matter
what,
you
write
that
human
name
in,
and
you
--
this
statute
doesn't
apply.
to
me,
that
means
it
never
applies.
all
right?
the
opposite
would
be
that
never,
under
any
circumstances,
can
you
sue
an
individual
for
a
--
for
a
--
for
an
official
act.
that
seems
the
opposite.
i
should
think
sometimes
you
certainly
could.
maybe
after
he
has
left
the
government.
but
i'm
looking
for
the
principle,
if
i'm
right,
that
would
divide
the
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
want
to
stick
to
your
extreme
position?
never,
just
write
the
thing
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
do
you
want
to
stick
to
that
position,
that
all
the
plaintiff--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--has
to
do
is
rewrite
the
name?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
an
excellent
reason.
can
you
give
me
one
single
example
ever
of
a
complaint
that
would
ever
be
dismissed
under
this
statute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
--
if
my
lawyer
is
clever
enough
to
look
up
who
the
individuals
were
and
substitute
their
names?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
you
say
that
if
the
person,
the
individual
you
are
suing,
is
a
member
of
the
foreign
state,
is
engaged
in
the
kind
of
activity
that
you're
complaining
about,
is
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
foreign
state,
and
the
relief
would
affect
the
foreign
state,
you
are
suing
the
foreign
state?
but
where
he
was
a
member
of
the
foreign
state,
and
you
want
money
from
him,
even
though
what
he
did
in
the
past
was
an
act
of
a
foreign
state,
this
lawsuit
is
not
affecting
him
in
his
capacity
--
is
not
affecting
the
foreign
state.
indeed,
there
isn't
even
one.
so
in
the
first
set,
he
falls
in
the
fsia.
in
the
second
set,
he
doesn't.
and
you
happen
to
have
the
second
set,
and,
therefore,
he
may
still
be
immune
for
what
he
did
in
the
past,
but
that
would
be
a
different
docket.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
--
that's
where
this
is
all
leading
me.
