justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
is
the
inquiry
any
different
than
the
one
that
would
go
under
the
common
law
head
of
state
inquiry?
what
would
be
different
in
the
two?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--wait
a
minute.
why
--
why
--
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
why
would
we
have
had
the
creation
of
all
of
these
common
law
immunities
attached
to
foreign
individuals
like
consular
and
diplomatic
and
heads
of
state
if
state
sovereign
immunity
was
going
to
cover
them
naturally?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
trying
to
go
before
the
act,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
before
it
was
passed,
because
that
was
congress's
first
statement,
and
we
have
to
figure
out
what
they
intended
to
replace
or
not
replace.
before
the
act
came
in,
what
activities
of
a
consular
office
would
not
have
been
covered
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
of
a
state?
what
activity
could
a
diplomat
have
engaged
in
or
a
consular
officer
have
engaged
in
that
state
immunity,
as
it
was
understood
at
the
time,
would
not
have
given
him
or
her?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
case
by
us
in
which
we
--
prior
to
the
fsia,
where
we
recognize
that
an
individual
was
immunized
in
the
way
that
the
state
was,
if
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
state?
or
were
all
of
our
cases
having
to
do
with
other
common
law
doctrines?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
kneedler--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
you
--
i'm--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sure
one
of
my
colleagues--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--will
get
you
back.
could
you
address
the
practical
implications
of
your
position?
and
by
that
i
mean,
it
took
2
years
for
the
state
--
for
the
government
to
respond
to
the
district
court
in
this
case.
tell
us
why
your
reading
of
the
statute
would
not
grind
the
courts
to
a
halt.
what
happens
when
justice
breyer's
situation
arises?
someone
takes
a
complaint
against
the
state
and
just
substitutes
the
names
of
the
persons.
what
--
why
wouldn't
the
courts
come
to
a
grinding
halt?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
we
go
back
to
the
practical--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wouldn't
that
be
the
same
question
that
you
would
ask
invoking
a
common
law
protection
like
head
of
state
or
act
of
state?
isn't
it
--
whether
it's
under
the
fsia
or
under
a
common
law
theory
--
the
identical
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
the
very
point?
if
the
inquiry
is
the
same
under
the
fsia
and
under
the
common
law,
and
we're
unsure
what
congress
intended
in
the
fsia,
because
it
certainly
doesn't
explicitly
say
it
covers
individual
acts,
shouldn't
we
defer
to
the
executive's
decisionmaking
in
what
is
--
has
been,
for
centuries
now,
within
its
jurisdiction?
why
should
we
take
that
power
away
when
the
inquiry
would
be
the
same
under
either
doctrine?
