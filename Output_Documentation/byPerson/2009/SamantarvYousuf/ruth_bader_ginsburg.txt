justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
are
right
about
that
--
i
guess
it
would
be
the
same
under
the
alien
tort
statute
--
then
the
filartiga
case
--
if
the
--
if
there
had
been
a
quest
--
request
to
dismiss
because
filartiga
was
a
former
officer,
and
the
same
thing
in
karadzic,
none
of
those
could
have
gone
forward?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
--
is
there
any
alien
tort
statute
or
the
torture
statute
that
would
have
survived,
under
your
view,
because
your
view
is
it's
no
exception
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
end
of
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that
doesn't
--
that's
not
going
to
happen.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
when
you
--
going
back
to
where
you
started
--
you
started
saying
the
officer
must
go
together
with
the
state,
because
in
reality
it's
the
same
thing;
it's
a
suit
against
the
state.
but
this
is
a
case
seeking
money
out
of
the
pocket
of
samantar
and
no
money
from
the
treasury
of
somalia,
so
why
is
the
suit
against
the
officer
here
equivalent
to
a
suit
against
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
sounds
like
you're
--
you're
talking
about
an
"act
of
state"
doctrine,
not
that
the
suit
against
one
is
the
equivalent
of
a
suit
against
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
that
i
followed
your
distinction
of
the
domestic
law,
per
se,
because
say,
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
to
come
within
that
act
and
to
have
the
government
cover
it,
the
officer
has
to
be
acting
within
the
scope
of
her
employment,
however
careless
or
reckless
she
may
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
you
maintain
that
position
when
the
department
of
state
takes
the
position
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
applies
to
a
state
and
agencies
and
instrumentalities,
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
officers?
if
it
was
all
that
certain
that
they
didn't
even
have
to
put
it
in,
then
is
--
the
state
department
is
being
recalcitrant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
your
point
is,
if
the
relief
is
against
the
state,
it
doesn't
matter
who
you
name
as
the
plaintiff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether
it's
injunctive
relief
or
money
relief,
if
the
relief
is
against
the
state,
obviously,
you
can't
dodge
it
by
naming
the
officer
instead.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
do
you
agree
with
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
it's
the
government's
advice
--
the
government
said,
in
the
old
days,
the
tate
letters
went
out
in
all
these
cases.
now,
they
no
longer
go
out
when
we're
dealing
with
a
state
itself
or
a
state
agency,
but
we
still
--
the
executive
--
basically,
as
i
read
the
government's
position,
the
government
is
saying:
the
executive
branch
decides.
we
tell
the
court.
and
if
we
don't
tell
the
court
that
this
person
can
be
sued,
then
the
person
can't
be
sued.
are
you
in
sync
with
the
government
in
that
we
are
now
back
to
the
executive
--
essentially,
the
executive
decides,
not
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
is
--
it's
now
many
years,
and
we
still
don't
--
the
state
department
has
said
in
effect:
we
decide.
can
you
tell
the
court,
is
this
defendant
amenable
to
suit
or
is
there
an
immunity
that
would
cover
him?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
this
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
does
this
very
case
establish
a
rule
of
law
for
the
foreign
state?
the
act
is
aimed
at
torturers.
the
remedy
comes
out
of
the
private
pocket.
how
does
this
establish
--
if
the
thing
plays
out
and
the
plaintiffs
prevail,
there
will
a
remedy
against
an
individual
actor;
there
will
be
no
relief
awarded
against
any
government.
how
would
it
set
a
rule
for
the
foreign
government?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
never
mind
that
this
person
has
long
lived
in
the
united
states,
in
virginia.
it
will
have
no
effect
--
will
have
no
effect
whatever
on
the
government
of
somalia?
