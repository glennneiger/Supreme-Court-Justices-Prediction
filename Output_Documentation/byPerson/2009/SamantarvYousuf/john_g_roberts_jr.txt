chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
today
in
case
08-1555,
samantar
v.
yousuf.
mr.
dvoretzky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'll
jump
on
the
hobby
horse
even
if
justice
kennedy
is
jumping
off.
i
mean,
the
--
the
exception
in
the
tvpa
is
to
the
jurisdictional
immunity
of
a
foreign
state.
that
doesn't
sound
the
way
you
would
just
establish
a
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
state
--
there
is
--
the
distinction
strikes
me
as
artificial
as
well.
we're
talking
about
insulating
state
acts.
the
only
way
a
state
can
act
is
through
people.
and
you're
saying:
well,
the
state
is
insulated,
but
the
people
who
do
the
acts
for
the
state
are
not.
i
don't
see
how
that
can
--
can
work.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
well,
then
--
but
the
whole
point
of
the
act
was
to
codify
what
was
there
before,
and
--
and
it
seems
odd
to
say,
well,
they
were
codifying
the
immunity
of
the
state,
but
not
the
immunity
of
the
only
way
a
state
can
act,
which
is
through
individuals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
millett,
i
thought--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
thought
the
whole
point
of
the
fsia
was
to
get
the
executive
branch
out
of
the
business
of
sending
letters
to
the
court
every
time
a
state
was
sued.
the
government
requested
it
for
that
purpose.
now
they
are
just
back
into
it
again
if
you
say,
well,
you
can
just
sue
the
individuals.
and
the
government's
position
in
this
case
confirms
that.
they're
--
they
tell
us
the
way
you
should
proceed
is
to
look
to
the
executive
branch
and,
basically,
we'll
send
you
a
letter
and
let
you
know.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
reason
you
have
the
fsia
is
undermined
by
the
position
you're
taking
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
courts
--
courts
decide
this
sort
of
question
all
the
time,
whether
you're
talking
about
principles
of
domestic
immunity
or
even
corporate
liability:
is
the
employee
on
a
frolic
or
is
it
a
detour?
determining
when
an
individual
is
acting
for
another
entity
as
opposed
to
on
--
on
his
own
business,
that's
a
very
common
inquiry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
--
you
friend--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
friend
said
it
happens
all
the
time.
he
cited
the
example
of
the
israeli
embassy
is
always
sending
letters
or
showing
up
in
court
when
their
agents
are
--
are
sued.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
made
that
a
long
sentence.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
wonder
--
i
wonder
if
the
example
you
give
or
the
point
you
make,
that
there's
no
functioning
somali
government,
doesn't
cut
the
other
way.
let's
assume
you
have
somebody
who
was
acting
in
an
official
capacity,
doing
what
his
job
required,
whether
you
like
it
or
not,
and
then
there's
a
change
in
the
somali
government;
and
the
united
states
likes
the
new
somali
government.
that
guy
is
kind
of
put
out
to
--
to
dry
because
he
can't
get
anybody
to
say
what
he
maintains
is
true,
which
was
i
was
acting
pursuant
to
official
policy
of
the
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
united
states
is
not
going
to
give
him
the
letter
he
needs
because
they
like
the
new
somali
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dvoretzky,
because
of
that,
we'll
give
you
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
hard
--
i
mean,
i
assume
the
reason
you
don't
rely
heavily
on
it
--
because
it
says
that
an
agency
or
instrumentality
is
an
entity.
i
mean,
we
usually
don't
think
of
individuals
as
being
entities.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-1555,
samantar
versus
yousuf.
