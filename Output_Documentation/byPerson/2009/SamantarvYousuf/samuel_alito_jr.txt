alito,

how
will
a
court
determine
whether
an
official
was
acting
within
the
official
scope
of
the
official's
responsibilities?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
court
can't
tell
by
looking
at
the
complaint?
is
there
going
to
be
direct
communication
between
the
court
and
the
foreign
government
on
this
issue?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
something
of
a
--
it's
something
of
a
mystery
that
the
fsia
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
this
form
of
immunity;
doesn't
codify
it,
doesn't
abrogate
it,
doesn't
preserve
the
preexisting
law.
do
you
have
an
explanation
for
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
was
this
act
originally
drafted
by
the
executive?
do
you
know?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
there
to
suggest
that
congress
was
looking
to
domestic
analogies?
this
has
nothing
--
immunity
of
officials
under
domestic
law
doesn't
bear
very
much
resemblance
to
the
immunities
that
are
available
to
foreign
officials,
does
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
position
about
the
preservation
of
the
immunities
that
existed
before?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
whatever
immunity
existed
previously
for
an
official
or
former
official
was
not
abrogated
by
the
fsia.
the
fsia
just
doesn't
address
that
subject
at
all.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there's
no
--
there
was
no
immunity
for
someone
who
is
the
equivalent
of
a
--
of
a
cabinet
officer,
previously?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
minister
of
this
or
that
in
another
government
--
they
have
no
official
immunity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
as
a
practical
matter--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--there's
a
--
i'm
sorry.
do
you
think,
as
practical
matter,
there's
a
difference
between
a
$10
million
judgment
against
a
state
for
something
that
is
official
state
policy
in
relation
to
defense,
and
a
$10
million
judgment
against
the
current
foreign
--
defense
minister
of
that
state
for
exactly
the
same
policy?
