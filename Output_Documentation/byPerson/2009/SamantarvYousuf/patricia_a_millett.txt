ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
kennedy,
the
hobby
horse
that
you
were
talking
about
actually
goes
right
--
right
to
the
heart
of
this
case,
and
that
is
of
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
in
which
congress
did
create
a
cause
of
action,
was
--
that
cause
of
action
was
created
for
--
to
impose
a
liability,
personal
liability,
for
acts
that
were
done
with
"actual
or
apparent"
--
but
included
with
"actual"
--
authority
of
the
foreign
state.
now,
if
congress
believed
that
the
fsia
immunized
everyone
who
undertook
acts
under
color
of
law,
or
at
a
minimum
with
actual
authority
of
the
foreign
state,
that
was
a
very
empty
statute.
now,
part
of
the
--
part
of
the--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--it
doesn't
seem
strange,
for
precisely
the
reason
that
we
have
still
with
us
today
a
former
minister
of
defense
when
we
have
no
ministry
of
defense
and
no
government
of
somalia
whatsoever.
the
reason
is
that
individuals
come
and
go.
individuals
engage
in
acts
that
are
not
acts
of
the
state--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
is
the
source
of
that
insulation.
and
the
very
difficulty
with--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
first
of
all,
states
do
corporate
acts
that
are
greater
than
the
--
the
whole
is
much
greater
than
the
parts
here.
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
part
can
claim
the
immunity
of
the
whole,
and
that
is
a
very
different
thing.
the
--
the
individual
--
individuals
may
act.
they
may
act
without
authority;
they
may
act
contrary
to
authority.
and
the
problem
with
the
fsia,
which
is
the
issue
here,
is
there
is
no
mechanism
in
it
for
addressing,
for
example,
whether
this
was
authorized.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
well,
justice
scalia,
if
you're
going
to
write
a
statute
that
addresses
individual
immunities
--
in
particular,
what
this
case
is
about,
personal
immunity
for
personal
liability,
then
those
statutes
look
very
different.
what's
the
first
thing
you
are
going
to
want?
you
are
going
to
want
some
way
to
decide
what
is
official
capacity
or
what
is
on
behalf
of
a
state,
and
you
are
going
to
want
a
mechanism
for
the
foreign
state,
or
at
least
the
state
department,
to
have
input
on
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
that
addresses
that.
you're
going
to--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--want
to
identify--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--yes,
he
does,
because--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--no,
that's
--
that's
not
true.
that's
not
true,
justice
breyer.
this
act
is
designed
to
protect
the
state
from
being
sued.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
you
can't--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--justice
breyer,
there
--
the
question
is
whether
congress,
in
the
fsia,
would
have
thought
that
is
a
suit
against
the
state.
now,
there
may
be
many
reasons
that
they
would
have.
if
they
thought,
in
the
restatement's
words
--
which
are
not
just
if
you
are
doing
an
official
act.
if
you
are
doing
an
official
act,
and
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
would
have
the
effect
of
enforcing
a
rule
of
law
against
the
state,
then
you
get
immunized.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
that--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i
think--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--this
act
is
good
against--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--that--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--that's
precisely
right.
that
is
the
second
half
of
the
restatement--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
the
second
half
of
the
restatement
says
you
have
to
be
enforcing
a
rule
--
the
effect--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--if
you're
enforcing
a
rule
of
law
against--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--that's
what
i
was
trying
to
give.
[laughter]
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
well,
there's
--
there's
two
levels
here.
first
of
all,
we'd
look
--
and
this
is
--
congress,
presumably,
was
drawing
on
a
well-established
domestic
law
analogies
here.
and
they
may
not
be
100
percent
controlling
here,
but
we
have
well-established
ways
of
understanding
whether
a
--
an
action
is
against
an
official
in
--
in
their
official
capacity.
we
look
at
the
form
of
relief,
the
nature
of
the
claim.
i
do
think
we
need
to
be
careful
here--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
this
is
a
domestic
statute,
and
for
congress
--
for
purposes
of
congress
deciding
whether
a
lawsuit
is
a
suit
against
a
sovereign
or
not
against
a
sovereign,
then
that
is
obviously
a
relevant
framework.
and
we
know
from
two
things
--
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
that
they
looked
at
that
framework,
but
also
embedded
in
the
fsia
itself,
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
itself,
is
that
same
distinction
between
holding
people
personally
liable
and
holding
the
state
liable.
in
1605a,
the
terrorist
state
exception,
on
15a
to
17a
of
the
addendum
to
our
brief,
they
create
a
cause
of
action,
one
against
the
state
and
one
against
the
individual
officials.
now,
the
one
against
the
individual
officials
is
a
recognition
that
individual
officials
can
have
personal
capacity
liability
for
damages,
consistent
with
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
otherwise,
if
--
if,
under
petitioner's
theory,
every
lawsuit
against
an
individual
--
and
the
language
there,
is
"acting
under
color
of
office
or
employment.
"
--if
every
suit
against
someone
under
color
of
office
or
employment
morphs
into
a
suit
against
the
state,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
to
create
against
the
individual.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
they
understood
it
was
individual
liability.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
no,
i
think
it's
because
the
inquiries
are
very
different,
as
this
case
illustrates.
and
that
is
--
first
of
all,
the
point
of
the
fsia,
as
section
1602
says,
is
to
codify
--
as
this
court's
cases
have
said,
was
to
--
largely
to
codify
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
did
not
apply
to
individual
immunity.
it
did
not
apply
to
the
head
of
state.
the
head
of
state
was
still
immune
for
commercial
acts
while
a
sitting
head
of
state.
so,
if
that
was
codified,
that
was
a
dramatic
change
done
silently
in
the
fsia.
the
reason
congress
would
want
to
retain
executive
branch
role
here
is
because
the
inquires
are
different,
and
the
first
one
is
the
most
elemental
one
in
petitioner's
case
and
that
is
the
assertion
that:
i
was
acting
in
my
official
capacity.
who
decides?
how
do
we
decide?
which
agents?
for
which
actions?
for
how
long?
what
level
of
immunity?
if
the
fsia
eliminated
the
head
of
state's
normal
absolute
immunity
while
sitting
from
all
actions,
commercial
or
not,
that's
a
dramatic
revolution.
we
can
now
sue
sitting
prime
ministers
and
presidents
and
distract
them
from
their
duties.
if
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
made
any
official's
official
act
an
act
of
the
state
--
and
remember,
they
are
now
every
level
of
the
foreign
government
down
to
the
mayor's
office,
and
corporate
officials,
too,
so
we've
now
eliminated
the
long-standing
principle
in
corporate
law
--
corporations
also
only
act
through
individuals
--
that
corporate
liability
and
individual
liability
go
hand-in-hand.
the
--
the
fsia
did
not
uproot
all
that,
and
it
provides
no
mechanisms.
that's
why
we
need
to
return
to
the
common
law
immunity.
now,
what
happens
when
you
have
a
case
that,
in
effect,
is
seeking
relief
against
the
state--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--as
you--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--when
you're
interpreting
the
language
in
the
fsia,
like
"under
color
of
law"
--
"under
color
of
office",
that
is
undoubtedly
a
job
for
the
court.
fsia.
deciding
which
agents
will
be
agents
of
the
state
is
nowhere
in
the
fsia.
one
court
has
applied
this
agency
--
agent
principle
to
say
that
when
we
hire
an
independent
contractor,
in
the
--
the
united
states
independent
contractor,
that
gets
the
immunity
of
the
foreign
sovereign
state.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
not
in
this
area,
where
those
decisions
have
foreign
relations
implications.
this
court
has
done
the
opposite.
and
it
has
--
it
has
waited
for
the
political
branches
to
lead,
and
it
has
followed.
because
the
decision
whether
we're
displacing
head
of
state
immunity
and
now
we're
going
to
have
commercial
immunity--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--justice
breyer,
the
--
i
don't
think
--
i
think
--
and
this
may
seem
a
little
formless,
but
i
simply
think
it's
right,
because
you're
dealing
with
statutory
text
here.
it's
not
so
much
that
the
defense
minister
himself
becomes
the
state;
it's
that
the
court
looking
at
that
action
goes:
this
is
really
an
action
against
the
state.
the
state
is
a
necessary
party
under
pimentel
and
must
be
here.
you,
individual,
actually
have
a
common
law
immunity,
an
absolute
immunity,
when
you
are,
under
the
restatement,
sued
for
official
acts.
and
the
effect
of
exercising
jurisdiction
would
be
to
enforce
a
rule
of
law
against
the
state.
when
you
have
those
two
things
together,
both
of
them,
you
are
entitled
to
immunity
because
this
is
an
action
against
the
state.
the
state's
a
necessary
party.
under
republic
of
philippines
v.
--
excuse
me
--
pimentel,
they
must
be
joined,
and
that
will
--
then
we'll
look
at
the
fsia
and
decide
whether
they
can
be
joined
or
not.
that's
the
way
it
works.
it's
not
that
individuals
--
and
this
is
a
problem
--
that
are
sort
of
popping
in
and
out
all
throughout
the
fsia.
if
it
were,
we
need
mechanisms
that
we
don't
have
here
to
deal
with
the
very
sensitive
decisions
of
which
individuals.
well,
how
will
we
say
you're
the
agent?
it's
--
the
individual
can
show
up
and
say
i
was
working
for
the
state;
i
was
doing
torture;
we
loved
torture;
that
was
our
policy
--
you
can
imagine
many
a
government,
if
notified,
if
there
was
a
mechanism
for
them
to
come
in,
would
say:
hang
on,
that
was
not
our
policy.
but
there's
no
mechanism
under
his
theory.
what
else
happens?
i
don't
even
understand,
under
this
theory,
what
happens.
normally,
what
happens
in
these
official
capacity
suits
that
we're
familiar
with
is
if
it
really
is
an
official
capacity,
then
we
--
we
substitute
the
state,
relief
will
run
against
the
state.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
but
there's
no
mechanism
here
for
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
that
may
be.
nobody
showed
up
in
court
here
until
we
got
to
this
court.
there
was
no
somali
government
to
show
up
to
say
whether
this
was
official
or
not,
and
the
state
department
didn't
show
up
for
2
years.
what
is
a
court
supposed
to
do?
well,
it
was
not
supposed
to
do
what
it
did
here
and
declare
that
it's
essentially
recognizing
the
transitional
federal
government
as
the
government
of
somalia,
because
it
didn't
know
what
else
to
do.
that
can't
be
right.
and,
again,
we
need
to
keep
in
mind
the
--
there
is
no
mechanism
in
the
text
of
the
fsia.
this
court
will
be
engaged
in
an
expedition
of
constructing
and
reconstructing
the
fsia
if
you
are
going
to
turn
it
into
either
a
westfall
substitution
act
with
no
language
here,
or
you
have
to
turn
it
into
a
personal
immunity
for
personal
liability
act.
that's
not
the
text.
sovereign
immunity
has
never
been
a
personal
liability
from
personal
--
personal
immunity
from
personal
liability
statute.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
yes,
as
to
--
as
individualized,
the
specialized
immunities--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i
do
--
we
do
agree.
now,
whether
we
--
we
don't
agree,
i
think
--
we
may
not
agree
100
percent
on
what
the
scope
or
content
of
that
immunity
is.
we
certainly
agree
that
head
of
state
immunity
was
preserved,
so
we
can't
sue
the
head
of
state
at
all
while
sitting.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
our
position
is
that
the
fsia
does
not
address
that.
our
view
of
what
the
common
law
did
beforehand
was
it
packed
most
of
this
into
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
underhill
v.
hernandez,
that
when
you
start
getting
to
lower
level
officials
who
are
not
heads
of
state,
who
are
not
diplomatically
protected,
consular
protected,
mission
on
--
have
mission
immunity,
that
that
--
a
lot
of
that
worked
through
act
of
state
doctrine,
and--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--there
--
there--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--well,
look
--
and
much
is
to
be
debated
on
remand.
that
issue
is
clearly
not
before
this
court.
as
we
look
at
the
cases
and
the
authorities,
in
fact
what
you
have
are
different
things
coming
together,
and
it
can
be
--
a
lot
of
times,
it
was
act
of
state
doctrines
that
were
going
on
there.
but
the
notion
that
individual
foreign
officials
are
not
personally
liable
for
actions
is
just
wrong,
and
that
is
because--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--or
cannot
be.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
i
don't
think
that's
the
exclusive
one,
and
i
think,
as
this
court
explained
even
in
altmann
that
deference
given
--
respectful
deference
is
always
going
to
be
given
when
the
executive
branch
weighs
in,
because
these
are
foreign
--
cases
that
have
foreign
policy
implications.
i
don't
think
it's
a
rubber
stamp
on
the
part
of
the
courts.
as
this
court
said
in
altmann,
it
depends
on
whether
they're
speaking
with
particularized
specialty.
if
they
come
in
and
say
mr.
samantar
was
the
head
of
state,
we're
done.
i
don't
think
there's
--
i'd
like
to
think
of
something;
i
can't
think
of
anything
that
would
save
us
from
that.
if
they
say
who
a
head
of
state
is,
then
that,
i
think,
has
largely
been
treated
as
binding
on
the
courts.
if
they
say
someone
--
they've
determined
that
someone
was
acting
in
an
official
capacity,
that's
going
to
receive
--
either
whether
communicated
from
the
foreign
state
or
based
on
principles
that
they
have
--
that's
going
to
carry
weight,
but
it's
not
going
to
necessarily
mean
you
automatically
dismiss
when
you
have
--
you
could
have
times
where
the
executive
branch
said
anyone
acting
under
color
of
law
should
be
immunized.
then--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--you're
going
to
have
the
executive
branch
and
the
tvpa
at
war.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
yes.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
well,
they
--
that
--
i'll
let
them
speak
for
their
own
position.
i
think
certainly
--
certainly
there
are
a
variety
of
doctrines,
a
variety
of
hurdles
any
case
has
to
get
through.
and
it's
not
just
the
executive's
views
on
a
case.
there's
things
like
exhaustion.
there's
necessary
party
inquiries.
there's
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
there's
substantive
limits
on
what
one
can
sue
for.
you
know,
the
torture
victim
protection
act
is
congress's
judgment
that
individuals
who
do
this,
consistent
with
international
law,
whatever
else
--
individuals
who
engage
in
torture
and
extrajudicial
killing
are
held
personally
liable
in
congress's
views
and
in
the
views
of
international
law.
and
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
doesn't
stop
that.
and
what's
critical,
again,
is
the--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--language
that's
missing--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--i
think--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--may
i,
sir?
the
--
first
of
all,
whether
one
thinks
it's
the
right
rule
or
not,
the
fsia
doesn't
tell
us
any
way
of
answering
who
was
in
official
capacity
and
getting
input,
at
a
minimum,
from
the
foreign
government
whose
mantle
this
individual
is
trying
to
wrap
themselves
in.
so
the
fsia
is
not
the
source.
the
executive
viewpoint
is
not
--
in
our
view,
is
not
the
sole
source.
and
there
are
--
there
are
a
number
of
other
doctrines,
whether
it's
act
of
state
doctrine,
whether
it
is
exhaustion
principles,
whether
it's
a
necessary
party
inquiries,
whether
it's
substantive
limits
on,
you
know,
law
of
nations
requirements
for
the
alien
tort
statute
or
the
torture
victim
protection
act.
there's
forum
non
conveniens.
there
are
a
battery
of
doctrines
that
come
together
to
very
narrowly
limit
these
actions.
and
what
the
state
department
looks
for
is
--
what
it
has
said
is
that
it
has
--
it
has
a
pattern
of
decisionmaking,
factors
it
lays
out
in
its
brief,
that
i
think
it
finds
--
it
says
it
finds
--
influential
in
the
process.
but
in
--
forgive
me
for--
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
--but
in
any
given
case,
the
role
of
the
executive
branch
is
going
to
have
more
or
less
deference
based
on
whether
it
is
speaking
something
within
its
traditional
expertise:
are
you
a
head
of
state?
were
you
a
diplomat?
but
when
it
comes
to
war
--
and
i
--
i'm
not
saying
it
would,
but
if
it
were
to
come
to
war
with
the
very
elements
of
the
torture
victim
protection
act
and
say
that
torture
by
an
individual
can
be
immunized
just
because
it
was
done
under
color
of
law,
then
i
think
the
court
has
a
very
difficult
concern
that
was
flagged
in
altmann
to
resolve,
and
i
think
we
might
draw
a
different
--
we
would
definitely
come
to
a
different
answer
than
the
executive
branch
in
that
situation.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
i'm
sorry.
i
apologize.
ms.
petitioner
patricia
a
millett
thank
you.
