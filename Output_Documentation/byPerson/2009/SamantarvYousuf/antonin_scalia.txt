justice
antonin
scalia
is
head
of
state
immunity
implicit
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
can't
this
be
a
--
a
different
body
of
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
mean,
you're
saying
they
--
they
left
head
of
state
immunity
to
the
common
law,
did
not
incorporate
it
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
why
--
why
should
i
believe
that
they
did
not
do
the
same
for
--
for
agent
of
state
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
--
can
you
get
to
the
text
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
that
you
--
that
you
assert
embraces
this
personal
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
come
back
--
can
i
come
back
to
the
text?
i
--
just
for
a
moment
there
we
were
on
the
text
of
this
act--
[laughter]
--that
the
suit
is
about.
and
you
said
where
--
where
the
immunity
exists
is
at
604,
which
says
a
foreign
state
shall
be
immune,
but
1603
defines
a
foreign
state,
which
--
which
says
that
it
includes
an
agency
or
instrumentality
of
a
foreign
state.
and
then
it
defines
agency
or
instrumentality
in
a
way
which,
it
seems
to
me,
does
not
include
private
individuals,
but
rather
just
artificial
legal
persons.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
--
i
would
find
it
extraordinary
that
it
would
go
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
it
includes
the
department
of
defense
but
would
leave
up
in
the
air
whether
it
includes
the
secretary
of
defense.
i
mean,
i
--
i
--
it
seems
to
me
much
more
likely
that
you
would
understand
a
foreign
state
to
include
the
departments
of
--
of
that
state
than
that
you
would
assume
a
foreign
state
to
include
individuals
who
happen
to
be
officials
of
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
was
no
uncertainty
about
--
about
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
entitled
to
it,
or
--
or
able
to
obtain
a
letter
from
the
state
department
that
would
confer
it
upon
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
--
well,
i
mean,
prior
to
the
fsia,
you
--
you
had
to
get
it
from
the
state
department,
didn't
you?
even
the
state,
for
that
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
--
what
if
the
state
department
came
in
and
said
no,
no
sovereign
immunity
here,
what
would
the
court
do?
would
the
court
be
bound
by
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
didn't
have
to
say
yes,
but
if
they
said
no,
that
--
it
pretty
much
carried
the
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
--
you
don't
assert
that
to
be
--
to
be
the
law
now,
do
you?
has
--
has
that
been
carried
forward--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
the
fsia?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
millett,
i
think
it's
a
pretty
empty
statute
as
well
to
interpret
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
to
immunize
the
department
of
defense,
but
not
the
secretary
of
defense.
i
mean,
that
seems
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the
ministry
of
defense
is
not
the
whole,
either.
i
mean,
you
--
you
acknowledge
that
--
that
each
individual
piece
of
a
foreign
sovereign
acquires
the
immunity,
but
somehow
not
--
not
the
principal
officers
of
--
of
the
sovereign
entity.
that
seems
to
me
very
strange.
i
mean,
i
guess
--
i
guess
you
could
write
it
that
way,
but
i
don't
know
why
anybody
would
want
to
write
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
the
--
the
mechanism
it
provides
is
judicial
determination
of
these
questions
that
--
that
you
say
have
to
be
determined
--
whether
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
authority
and
all
that
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
what
it
did?
it
took
it
away
from
the
executive,
gave
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
gather
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
state
department
asserts
the
right
to
say:
yes,
he
was
acting
in
a
--
in
an
official
capacity,
but
sock
it
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
--
the
state
department
wants
to
be
able
to
decide
whether
individuals
will
be
held
liable,
whether
they
were
acting
in
an
official
capacity
or
not;
isn't
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
i
find
it
much
more
acceptable
to
have
the
state
department
say
that
a
particular
foreign
country
should
be
let
off
the
hook,
which
is
what
they
used
to
do
with
the
tate
letters,
than
i
do
to
leave
it
up
to
the
state
department
whether
--
whether
an
individual
human
being
shall
be
--
shall
be
punished
or
not.
i
--
i
somehow
find
that
less
within
the
realm
of
the
--
of
the
foreign
affairs
power
of
the
state
department.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
very
nice.
a
few
years
ago,
a
spanish
magistrate
allowed
a
lawsuit
to
proceed,
as
i
recall,
against
our
secretary
of
defense.
and
what
you
say
is
that
that's
perfectly
okay.
it's
up
to
the
spanish
government
to
assert
that
that
suit
should
not
proceed,
and
if
it
doesn't,
it's
perfectly
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
were
a
lot
of
long
sentences
in
there--
[laughter]
