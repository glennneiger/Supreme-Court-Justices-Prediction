mr.
shay
dvoretzky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fsia
applies
to
suits
against
foreign
officials
for
acts
taken
on
the
state's
behalf,
because
such
suits
are
the
equivalent
of
a
suit
against
the
state
directly.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
the
torture
victim
protection
act
creates
a
cause
of
action
but
is
silent
about
immunity,
and,
therefore,
has
to
be
interpreted
consistently
with
background
immunity
principles
and
consistently
with
a
preexisting
statute
codifying
immunity,
rather
than--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--i'm
sorry.
could
you
repeat--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--dellmuth
v.
muth,
for
one
thing.
also,
the
government
previously
argued
that
the
tvpa
has
to
be
interpreted
consistent
with
preexisting
immunity
principles.
when
congress
wants
to
waive
immunity,
it
knows
how
to
do
that.
for
example,
it
amended
the
fsia
to
specifically
waive
immunity
for
actions
against
state
sponsors
of
terrorism.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
yes.
if
congress
wishes
to
waive
immunity,
it
has
to
do
so
expressly.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
if,
in
those
cases,
an
immunity
defense
had
been
asserted
and
it
had
been
established
that
the
official
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state,
then,
yes,
immunity
would
apply.
those
defenses
were
not
asserted
in
those
cases,
though.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
absolutely,
there
are
torture
victim
protection
act
and
ats
claims
that
could
be
brought.
they
could
be
brought
whenever
an
fsia
exception
applies.
so,
for
example,
if
an
action
were
brought
against
an
official
of
a
state
sponsor
of
terrorism,
the
fsia
exception
for
that
would
apply.
if
a
foreign
state
waived
immunity,
either
explicitly
or
implicitly--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--there
are
cases
where
it
has
happened.
for
example,
the
philippines
effectively
waived
immunity
when
claims
were
brought
against
marcos.
so
it
certainly
could
happen.
congress
envisioned
that
the
statute
would
be
interpreted
consistently
with
immunity
principles.
the
legislative
history
supports
that
inference.
there
are
reports
in
the
legislative
history
and
a
floor
statement
by
senator
specter
saying
that
the
fsia
could
provide
an
immunity
defense
to
a
claim
against
an
official
where
the
official
can
establish
an
agency
relationship
with
the
state.
here,
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
samantar
was
acting
in
an
official
capacity,
because
he
is
being
sued
for
his
actions
as
a
prime
minister
and
as
a
defense
minister,
in
the
midst
of
what
was
effectively
quelling
a
secessionist
insurgency.
that's
an
inherent--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--well,
it's
not
a
clear
statement
because
it's
only
a
clear
statement
creating
a
cause
of
action.
it's
not
a
clear
statement
that
speaks
to
immunity.
and,
again,
where
congress
has
wanted
to
waive
immunity,
it
has
done
that
expressly,
as
where
it
waived
the
immunity
of
a
foreign
state
for
claims
brought
against
state
sponsors
of
terrorism.
and
dellmuth
v.
muth,
i
think,
is
on
point
because
there
the
court
held
that
even
though
a
cause
of
action
was
created
that
would
principally
apply
only
to
state
agencies,
that
in
and
of
itself
was
not
sufficient
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
you're
talking
about
the
exception
in
the
tvpa
for
state
sponsors
of
terrorism?
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
but
the
tvpa
--
the
fsia,
in
addition,
also
has
a
cause
of
action
applicable
to
state
sponsors
of
terrorism.
that's
in
the
red
brief
at
17a.
it's
28
u.s.c.
section
1605a(c).
and
so
in
that
situation,
what
congress
did
was
it
both
created
a
cause
of
action
against
state
sponsors
of
terrorism
and
their
officials
and
waived
immunity.
in
the
tvpa,
all
that
congress
did
was
to
create
a
cause
of
action.
and
so
that
cause
of
action
has
to
be
read
consistently
with
background
principles
of
immunity.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
because
the
touchstone
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
law,
which
the
fsia
codified,
is
that
one
nation's
courts
cannot
sit
in
judgment
of
another
nation's
acts.
and
the
basis
for
liability
that's
asserted
in
this
case
is
samantar's
acts
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
somalia.
the
issue
is
not
who
pays
the
judgment;
the
issue
is
whose
acts
are
in
question.
now,
in
the
domestic
context,
of
course,
the
distinction
between
personal
liability
and
liability
from
the
state
may
matter,
but
that's
only
because--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--the
"act
of
state"
doctrine
is
distinct
from
immunity
doctrines,
although
they
have
certain
shared
underpinnings
and
shared
comity
considerations.
and
just
as
the
under
--
act
of
state
doctrine
is
concerned
with
not
judging
the
acts
of
foreign
states,
so
too
is
foreign
sovereign
immunity
law.
that's
the
fundamental
premise
of
foreign
--
of
foreign
sovereignty
immunity
law.
in
the
domestic
context,
courts
do
sometimes
say
that
an
official
can
be
sued
for
personal
liability
because
he
wasn't
acting
for
the
state
if
he
violated
the
state's
controlling
law.
u.s.
courts
are
able
to
make
that
determination
because
our
courts
are
the
ultimate
arbiters
of
domestic
law.
u.s.
courts
are
not
the
ultimate
arbiters
of
foreign
law.
in
fact,
a
determination
that
an
official
was
not
acting
for
a
foreign
state
because
he
must
have
violated
the
foreign
state's
law
or
international
law
is
precisely
what
foreign
sovereign
immunity
prohibits.
so
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
context,
as
long
as
the
underlying
acts
are
those
of
the
state,
foreign
sovereign
immunity
prohibits
the
case
from
proceeding.
and
that--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--that
--
and
that
goes
to
when
the
government
would
be
liable
for
the
employee's
acts.
in
our
case,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
when
the
official
can
be
personally
liable
for
acts
of
the
state.
and
in
the
domestic
context,
we
say
the
official
can
be
liable
when
he
must
not
have
been
acting
for
the
state
because
he
violated
the
state's
controlling
law.
foreign
sovereign
immunity
prohibits
that
determination
with
respect
to
the
law
of
foreign
states,
and
it
prohibits
u.s.
courts
from
imposing
their
view
of
international
law
on
other
courts
to
conclude
that
an
official
must
not
have
been
acting
for
his
state.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
ordinarily,
the
foreign
state
would
tell
you,
and
that
would
be
dispositive
of
the
matter.
if
the
foreign
state
doesn't
tell
you,
you
would
look
at
the
nature
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
see
if
they
fall
within
a
category
of
conduct
that
is
inherently
viewed
in
--
as
sovereign.
atop
that
list--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--a
foreign
government
ordinarily
is
going
to
--
is
going
to
get
involved
in
the
case
and
indicate
whether
it
wishes
to
assert
immunity
on
behalf
of
the
official
or
not.
for
example,
there
have
been
several
cases
involving
suits
against
israeli
officials,
and
the
israeli
embassy
communicated
to
the
courts
and
to
the
state
department
that
these
were
acts
of
israel
and
the
official
policy
of
the
state.
again,
if
you
don't
have
that,
though,
it's
not
going
to
be
a
difficult
inquiry,
typically,
to
look
and
see
whether
inherently
sovereign
acts
are
what's
at
issue.
for
example,
if
you
have
military
or
police
conduct,
as
this
court
said
in
saudi
arabia
v.
nelson,
that's
inherently
sovereign
conduct.
legislative--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--i
--
i
think
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
it's
an
official
act
would
be
the
same,
but
head
of
state
immunity
is
a
different
sort
of
immunity
than
sovereign
immunity.
it's
much
broader,
insofar
as
it
covers
even
personal
acts
by
a
head
of
state
while
he's
in
office,
whereas
for
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
what
you're
looking
to
distinguish
is
whether
the
official
was
engaged
in
personal
activity
or
whether
he
was
engaged
in
acts
on
behalf
of
the
state.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
no.
head
of
state
immunity
is
a
different
body
of
common
law
immunity
that
the
fsia--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--do
you
mean,
why
can't
this--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--because
head
of
state
immunity
is
not
a
form
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
what
congress
did
in
this
act
was
it
codified
the
law
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
at
common
law,
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state
was
always
understood
to
extend
to
officials
for
their
official
acts.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
because
consular
and
diplomatic
immunity
are
very
different
in
scope
and
in
purpose
than
state
sovereign
immunity.
there
are
two
sources
of
immunity
that
an
individual
might
be
entitled
to.
there
is
the
immunity
that
flows
from
the
state
itself
for
official
acts,
and
there
is
immunity
that
flows
from
the
individual's
office,
like
diplomatic
and
consular
immunity.
diplomatic
and
consular
immunity
are
meant
to
ensure
that
states
can
conduct
their
business
without
tying
up
their
officials
while
they
are
in
office
in
litigation
in
foreign
courts
over
any
matters,
personal
or
official.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
he
could
get
into
a
car
accident.
diplomatic
and
consular
immunity
would
prevent
the
diplomat
or
the
consul
from
being
sued
for
tort
damages
for
a
car
accident
in
a
foreign
state.
official
immunity
would
not,
because
driving
is
not
considered
an
official
policy
of
the
state
in
the
way
that,
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
alito,
police
or
military
conduct
would
be.
so
that's
the
distinction
between
official
conduct
and
conduct
that
may
well
be
within
the
scope
of
employment
but
is
not
entitled
to
the
state's
immunity.
and
where
congress--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--section
1603(a)
--
excuse
me
--
section
1604
says
that
"a
foreign
state
shall
be
immune
from
the
jurisdiction.
"
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
states.
when
a
suit
is
brought
against
an
official
for
his
official
act,
that
is
effectively
subjecting
the
foreign
state
itself
to
u.s.
jurisdiction.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
i
think
this
statute
would
block
the
suit--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--because
the
source
of
immunity
in
that
case
was
head
of
state
immunity,
which
is
different
from
the
state
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--if
the
state--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--it
was--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--if
the--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--if
the
state
does
not
exist,
then
i
think
you
probably
could
sue
the
official--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--because--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--because
ultimately,
what
foreign
sovereign
immunity
and
this
statute
are
concerned
with
is
protecting
a
foreign
state's
act
from
being
judged
in
court.
in
your
example
of
the
department
of
the
army
which
subsequently
is
bought
by
another
company,
and
the
foreign
state
exists,
the
foreign
state's
acts
are
still
being
judged
regardless
of
the
status
of
that
department--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--you
may
very
well
have
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
but--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--the
act
of
state
doctrine
might
very
well
cover
your
hypothetical,
but
it's
a
different
doctrine
that
is
not
duplicative
of
immunity.
it
serves
different
purposes.
immunity
prevents
the
suit
from
proceeding
at
the
outset.
it's
an
immunity
not
only
from
liability,
but
an
immunity
from
the
litigation
process
itself.
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
a
discretionary
doctrine,
first
of
all.
it's
not
automatic
in
the
way
that
immunity
is;
and,
second
of
all,
it
applies
only
on
the
merits;
and,
third,
it
serves
different
purposes
because
it
can
be
used
even
offensively
and
even
in
cases
where
the
state
itself
is
not
a
party,
simply
to
establish
the
legality
of
a
state's
conduct
within
its
own
territory.
so
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
a
judge-made
prudential
doctrine
that
serves
different
purposes
than
immunity.
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
immunity
would
apply
to
the
acts
of
the
--
of
the
department
of
the
army
because,
regardless
of
when
suit
is
brought,
those
acts
are
still
those
of
the
state.
in
the
hypothetical
where
a
state
does
not
exist
at
all,
then
1604
would
not
come
into
play
because
there
is
no
foreign
state
to
be
held
immune.
that's
not
this
case,
though.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
section
1603(a)
does
not
define
a
foreign
state
exhaustively.
it
simply
states
what
a
foreign
state
includes.
we
know
that
because,
if
you
look
at
1603(b),
the
very
next
subsection,
congress
said
what
"an
agency
or
instrumentality"
means.
so
had
it
meant
to
define
exhaustively
what
"a
foreign
state"
means,
it
could
have
said:
"a
foreign
state"
means
its
political
subdivisions,
agencies,
or
instrumentalities.
the
fact
that
congress
said
that
a
foreign
state
includes
a
political
subdivision
and
its
agencies
or
instrumentalities
suggests
that
it
includes
more
than
just
the
enumerated
entities.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
and
the
reason
that
i
think
that
congress
had
to
go
out
of
its
way
to
define
what
constitutes
an
agency
or
instrumentality
is
that,
at
the
time
that
the
fsia
was
passed,
there
was
uncertainty
about
whether
certain
governmental
or
corporate
entities
were
included,
maybe
not
the
department
of
defense,
but
whether
certain
commercial
entities
owned
by
the
state
were
entitled
to
the
state's
immunity.
there
was--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--precisely.
there
was
no
uncertainty
about
whether
individuals
were
included.
and
so
when
congress
was
simply
continuing
the
common
law
against
which
it
passed
this
statute,
it
didn't
need
to
expressly
say--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--the
state
department
asked,
before
the
fsia
was
passed,
to
have
executive
discretion
take
--
taken
away
with
respect
to
immunity
determinations.
congress
agreed
with
that
judgment
and
passed
the
fsia,
and
now
the
executive
branch
has
to
be
held
to
that
judgment
that
was
made.
as
far--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--i
don't,
other
than
the
explanation
that
i
gave
justice
scalia,
which
is:
this
immunity
was
not
in
question
at
the
time
that
the
fsia
was
passed,
and
when
congress
passes
a
statute
in
an
area
where
there
had
been
preexisting
common
law,
this
court
presumes
that
congress
meant
to
incorporate
and
continue
that
common
law
and
not
abrogate
it
unless
congress
has
spoken
directly
to
the
contrary.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
drafted
by
the
executive
or
whether
it
was
drafted
by
congress,
but
it
was
passed
at
the
request
of
the
executive
branch
because
there
was
--
the
state
department
was
put
in
a
position
of
being
under
diplomatic
pressure
to
grant
immunity
on
--
on
favored
status
to
certain
nations
who
asked
for
it
when
they
wouldn't
otherwise
be
entitled
to
it.
this--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--this
court's
cases
generally
had
to
do
with
other
doctrines.
the
one
possible
exception
to
that
is
underhill,
in
which
the
second
circuit's
decision
decided
the
issue
on
foreign
sovereign
immunity
grounds,
and
this
court
affirmed.
it's
unclear
entirely
whether
this
court's
affirmance
was
on
act
of
state
or
immunity
grounds,
but
also
at
the
time
that
that
decision
was
--
came
down,
act
of
state
and
immunity
doctrines
were
very
much
intertwined.
there
is
no
question,
however,
as
the
government
argues,
that
the
common
law
before
the
fsia
recognized
that
officials
were
entitled
to
immunity
--
to
the
state's
immunity
for
their
official
acts.
the
second
restatement,
which
was
--
which
was
promulgated
in
1965
just
before
the
fsia,
says
that.
the
second
circuit's
decision
from
1971,
just
before
the
fsia
was
passed,
in
heaney,
says
that.
and
it--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--no.
the
--
the
--
prior
to
the
fsia,
this
was
a
common
law
doctrine
that
courts
would
often
apply
without
any
input
from
the
state
department.
in
the
heaney
case,
for
example,
the
state
department
was
asked
to
provide
input
and
provided
none,
and
the
second
circuit
nonetheless
held
that,
using
the
generally
applicable
common
law
principles,
that
the
official
was
entitled
to
immunity
for
the
state's
acts.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
ordinarily,
the
court
would
at
least
defer
to
that.
whether
it
would
be
definitively
bound
by
--
by
that
or
not,
it
would
at
least
be
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
that's
probably
right.
and
--
but
the
real
issue
that
prompted
the
fsia--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--no--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--no,
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
fsia
--
again,
at
the
executive
branch's
request
--
was
to
take
the
executive
out
of
that
process
and
to--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--well--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--our
position
is
that
the
fsia
incorporates
the
common
law
and
that
mr.
samantar
is
entitled
to
immunity
under
the
statute.
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
that,
we
would
certainly
wish
to
assert
common
law
defenses
on
remand,
but
we
believe
that
the
statute
resolves
the
question.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
i'll
try
to
keep
it
short.
i'd
like
to
make
three
points:
first
of
all,
when
a
suit
is
brought
against
a
--
an
official
or
former
official,
the
only
question
that
a
court
will
need
to
answer
under
the
fsia
is
whether
the
acts
challenged
are
those
of
the
state.
that's
a
determination
that
courts
can
readily
make
and
are
accustomed
to
making.
by
contrast--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--it
is
the
same
inquiry
that
you
would
have
asked
under
the
common
law
in
inquiring
whether
the
state's
immunity
extends
to
its
officials.
what
the
fsia
did
was
it
codified
that
rule,
and
it
took
away
executive
branch
discretion
to
deviate
from
it.
if
you
look
at
the
solicitor--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--first
of
all,
as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
this
has
not
historically
been
a
long-standing
power
of
the
executive
in
the
way
that
the
immunity
itself
has
been
recognized
under
the
common
law.
and
what
congress
did
in
1976
was
it
codified
the
substance
of
the
common
law
but
took
away
that
procedure.
and
this
case
demonstrates
exactly
why
it's
necessary
to
extend
the
fsia
to
foreign
officials
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
make
the
fsia
mean
anything
at
all,
and
in
order
to
ensure
the
uniformity
and
predictability
that
congress
intended
through
the
statute.
if
you
look
at
the
factors
that
the
solicitor
general
proposes
to
take
into
account
in
this
case
--
i'm
looking
at
page
7
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
--
"petitioner's
residence
in
the
united
states
rather
than
somalia,
the
nature
of
the
acts
alleged.
"
the
"invocation
of
a
particular
statutory
right.
"
the
--
the
state
of
the
government
in
somalia
--
these
are
factors
that
have
no
basis
in
the
common
law
that
the
fsia
codified.
no
case
has
ever
held
that
a
foreign
official
or
former
official
loses
immunity
for
official
acts
on
the
basis
of
these
sorts
of
factors.
moreover--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--all
right.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
because
the
restatement
--
what
the
restatement,
which
summarized
the
common
laws
as
of
the
time
of
the
fsia's
enactment,
says
that
an
official
is
immune
for
his
acts
on
behalf
of
a
state
if
exercising
jurisdiction
would
enforce
a
rule
of
law
against
the
foreign
state.
you
enforce
a
rule
of
law
against
a
foreign
state
just
as
much
by
threatening
to
bankrupt
an
official
as
soon
as
he
leaves
office--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--as
you
do
by
issuing--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--because
enforcing
a
judgment
against
a
foreign
official,
threatening
to
bankrupt
the
person
as
soon
as
he
or
she
leaves
office,
has
just
as
much
effect
on
the
state
itself
as
--
as
enforcing
a
judgment
directly
against
the
state.
it
will
force
officials
to
conform
their
conduct
on
behalf
of--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--but
the
--
the
rule
that
the
government
proposes,
and
the
courts
would
presumably
be
left
to
apply
on
their
own
in
the
many
cases
like
this
one
and
the
9/11
litigation
against
the
saudis
where
the
government
doesn't
weigh
in,
that
rule
does
not
draw
those
neat
lines.
why,
for
example,
would
we
know
that
a
prime
minister
who
comes
to
visit
the
united
states
has
not
spent
enough
time
here
in
order
to
have
his
official
immunity
abrogated?
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
1603(b)(1)
is
the
agency--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--we
do
argue
that
in
the
alternative.
we
think
our
principal
argument
is
that--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--we
make
that
argument
in
the
alternative.
our
principal
argument
is
based--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--our
principal
argument
is
based
on
the
text
of
1604,
which
is
that
in
--
that
subjecting
official
acts--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
because
16
(b)(1)
defines
agencies
or
instrumentalities.
and
an
official,
like
an
agency
or
instrumentality,
is
the
means
through
which
the
state
acts.
and,
so,
if
the
foreign
state
include--
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
--1602
applies
to
states,
and
our
argument
is
that
exercising
jurisdiction
over
the
official
in
the
circumstances
like
these
would
be
exercising
jurisdiction
over
the
state.
an
entity,
your
honor,
is
not
--
is
not
automatically
read
to
include
a
person,
but
it
doesn't
preclude
persons,
either,
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
chuidian.
mr.
shay
dvoretzky
thank
you.
