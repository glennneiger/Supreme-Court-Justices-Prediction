mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
dramatic
collapse
of
enron
had
profound
reverberations
experienced
throughout
the
houston
economy
and
citizenry.
countless
individuals
in
the
houston
area
were
affected,
as
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
recognized,
so
much
so
that
60
percent
of
the
jury
venire
affirmatively
acknowledged
in
the
responses
to
questionnaires
that
they
would
be
unable
to
set
aside
their
deep-seated
biases
or
doubted
their
ability
to
do
so,
or
that
they
were
angry
about
enron's
collapse,
an
anger
that
was
manifested
in
the
vitriolic
terms
in
which
petitioner
jeff
skilling
was
referred
to
repeatedly
both
in
the
questionnaires
and
in
the
community
more
generally.
the
passions
about
this
case
were
so
intense
and
the
connections
to
enron
ran
so
deep
that
the
entire
united
states
attorney's
office,
all
150
or
so
attorneys,
recused
themselves
from
the
investigation
that
culminated
in
this
prosecution.
in
those
conditions,
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
unanimously
concluding
that
this
was
one
of
the
very
rare
cases
in
which,
because
of
the
degree
of
passion
and
prejudice
in
the
community,
the
process
of
voir
dire
cannot
be
relied
upon
to
adequately
ferret
out
and
identify
unduly
biased
jurors.
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
your
honor,
to
be
clear
even
one
juror
who
should
have
been
excluded
and
wasn't
would
have
been
enough,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
the
reason
that
trial
counsel
objected
to
six
specific
jurors
at
the
juncture
that
your
honor's
referring
to
is
that
that
corresponded
to
six
cause
objections
that
had
been,
in
our
view,
erroneously
denied.
now,
that
in
no
way
suggests
that
we
were
satisfied
with
the
remainder
of
the
jury.
we
had
made
an
objection--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right,
and
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say,
your
honor,
that
the
reason
why
trial
counsel
identified
six
specific
jurors
was
that
there
were
six
other
jurors
who
would
have
been
on
the
venire
as
to
whom
we
had
applied
--
as
to
whom
we
had
asserted
a
cause
challenge
that
was
denied,
and
because
of
that
we
had
to
use
a
preemptory
to
strike
those
jurors,
which
left
us
without--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
no.
there
were
six
as
--
there
were
six
remaining
as
to
which
we
didn't
have
a
corresponding
for-cause
objection
that
had
been
denied.
but
in
no
way
indicates
that
we
were
satisfied
with
the
other
six.
from
the
very
outset,
we
complained
about
this
process.
we
said
at
the
outset
before
trial
that
no
juror
could
be
seated
in
this
case
because
the
process
of
voir
dire
couldn't
adequately
be
relied
upon
in
these
conditions.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
the
process
was
deficient
in
a
couple
of
respects,
your
honor:
first,
with
respect
to
time
and
scope.
the
voir
dire
that
the
trial
judge
conducted
was
essentially
an
ordinary
voir
dire
for
ordinary
circumstances.
he
announced
before
the
fact
that
the
voir
dire
would
be
conducted
in
a
period
of
1
day,
and
we
objected
to
that.
he
also
announced
that
he
would
have
limited
questioning
and
that
counsel
would
have
very
limited
opportunity
to
follow
up
with
additional
questions.
we
also
objected
clearly
and
repeatedly
to
that.
and
that
was
manifested
in
the
voir
dire
that
occurred,
because
what
the
trial
judge
did
is
made
two
fundamental,
we
think,
mistakes
in
the
way
he
conducted
the
voir
dire.
one
occurs
with
respect
to
those
jurors
as
to
whom
they
had
laid
bare
their
biases,
and
another
occurs
with
respect
to
those
jurors
as
to
whom
they
didn't
affirmatively
acknowledge
their
biases,
but,
given
the
conditions
that
prevailed
in
the
community,
they
might
well
have
had
biases
that
they
didn't
affirmatively
acknowledge.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first,
the
mistake
that,
in
our
view,
the
trial
judge
made
was
to
accept
a
simple
assurance
of
fairness
in
the
face
of
overt
statements
of
bias
and
in
conditions
that
confronted
this
community,
where
there
was
deep-seated
community
prejudice
and
animus
that
permeated
the
houston
--
that
permeated
the
city
of
houston,
that
kind
of
acceptance
of
a
simple
assurance
of
fairness
in
the
face
of
repeated
overt
statements
of
bias
shouldn't
be
countenanced.
and
we
think
what
the
trial
court
should
have
done
in
that
situation
is
to
move
to
an
additional
juror.
but
instead
of
doing
that,
the
trial
court
interviewed
46
jurors,
nearly
8
more
than
the
minimum
that
was
necessary
to
constitute
a
jury
in
this
case.
and
just
to
give
this
a
frame
of
reference,
the
entire
voir
dire
process
in
this
case
took
5
hours,
and
the
trial
judge
interviewed
each
juror
for
approximately
4
and
a
half
minutes.
by
way
of
comparison--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--he
--
he
did.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
he
gave
some
time,
justice
ginsburg,
but
he
made
clear
before
the
voir
dire
began
that
that
opportunity
was
going
to
be
limited
both
in
time
and
scope.
with
respect
to
scope
--
and
this
is
at
page
11805
of
the
record
--
what
he
said
was
that
follow-up
questioning
would
be
permitted
if
it
was
reasonable
and
if
it
was
related
to
the
purposes
for
which
the
juror
was
brought
before
the
bench.
and
just
to
paint
the
picture
a
little
bit,
the
--
the
potential
jurors
were
brought
before
the
bench,
and
they
were
left
standing,
which
i
think
reinforced
the
conception
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
rather
quick
affair
and
it
was
not
going
to
allow
the
kind
of
extensive,
meaningful
follow-up
that
we
thought
was
required.
and
to
give
it
a
frame
of
reference,
in
the
oklahoma
city
bombing
case,
the
prosecution
of
timothy
mcveigh,
that
proceeding
was
transferred
from
the
city
of
oklahoma
city
to
denver,
but
even
after
the
transfer,
the
trial
judge
conducted
an
18-day
voir
dire
with
an
average
of
1
hour
of
interviews
per
juror;
18
days
and
1
hour
as
compared
with
5
hours
and
4
and
a
half
minutes.
and
we
think
the
oklahoma
city
experience
is
much
more
befitting
of
the
kind
of
voir
dire
that's
necessary
in
circumstances
of
community
prejudice
and
passion
of
the
kind
that
existed
here.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
we
did.
we--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure,
it
was,
your
honor,
and
by
no
means
would
we
in
any
way
diminish
the
--
the
profound
human
tragedy
that
accompanied
the
oklahoma
city
case,
but
i
think
the
reality
of
the
sentiment
on
the
ground
in
houston
was
that
houston
citizens,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
in
fact
referred
to
the
--
to
what
happened
in
the
wake
of
the
collapse
of
enron
in
terms
that
were
similar
to
the
way
they
referred
to
terrorist
attacks.
they
--
they
in
fact
talked
about
it
in
terms
of
the
9/11
attack.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i'd
like
to
clarify
one
aspect
of
that,
if
i
could,
and
that's
that
our
argument
is
not
--
and
it
hasn't
been
at
any
point
in
this
proceeding
--
that
pretrial
publicity
caused
the
passion
and
prejudice
in
the
community.
this
is
--
is
very
much
a
case
in
which
pretrial
publicity
was
a
symptom
rather
than
the
cause.
now,
pretrial
publicity,
to
be
sure,
stoked
the
passions
that
--
that
already
lay
within
the
community,
but
really
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
passions
existed
regardless
of
pretrial
publicity.
and
i
think
the
juror
questionnaires
and
the
surveys
and
all
the
other
evidence
that
we
put
before
the
district
court
manifests
that.
if
you
look
at
the
juror
questionnaires
--
and
they
are
--
there
are
several
examples
of
situations
in
which
particular
jurors
said
that
they
were
unaware
of
any
of
the
pretrial
publicity,
they
did
not
watch
the
news,
they
didn't
read
the
newspapers,
they
hadn't
seen
the
movies
about
enron,
but
yet
they
still
said
they
had
feelings
about
jeff
skilling
and
ken
lay.
juror
63,
a
person
who
wound
up
on
the
panel,
is
a
good
example
of
that.
she
answered
"no"
to
all
the
questions
concerning
her
exposure
to
pretrial
publicity,
but
then
when
she
was
asked
whether
she
had
views
about
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
jeff
skilling,
she
said
yes,
she
did;
and
she
elaborated
on
that
by
explaining
that
i
think
he
probably
knew
he
was
breaking
the
law.
so
this
is
a
person
who,
notwithstanding
a
lack
of
exposure
to
pretrial
publicity--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
--
there
was
a
bit
of
follow-up
to
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
nature
of
the
follow-up
is
--
is
quite
illuminating
on
what
we
think
are
some
of
the
fatal
flaws
in
this
voir
dire
process.
the
follow-up--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
our
first
--
certainly,
there
should
have
been
a
more
intensive
voir
dire,
justice
alito.
now,
our
first
order
of
submission
is
that
the
proceedings
should
have
been
transferred,
not
necessarily
because
there
don't
in
fact
exist
or
there
didn't
in
fact
exist
12
unbiased
jurors
in
the
city
of
houston.
our
point
is
a
different
one,
and
that
is
that
in
conditions
where
you
have
the
level
of
passion
and
prejudice
that
permeated
the
houston
community,
there's
too
great
a
risk
that
the
process
of
voir
dire
and
particularly
the
ordinary
process
of
voir
dire
wouldn't
be
successful
in
identifying
those
12
people.
that's
the
danger.
and
the
other
problem
with
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
there
are
4
and
a
half
million
citizens
in
houston,
which
i
think
is
part
of
your
honor's
question,
is
that
that
would
mean
more
if
the
trial
judge
had
gone
deeper
into
the
jury
pool
than
the
mere
46
jurors
he
did
interview.
because
when
he
interviewed
those
46
and
stopped
at
that
point,
what
we
were
left
with
was
a
jury
panel
as
to
which
there
was
too
great
a
danger
of
bias,
too
great
a
danger
that
they
would
bring
their
biases
to
bear
with
them
in
adjudicating
petitioner's
guilt.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
it
has
to
be
read
against
the
context
of
whether
we
can
be
confident
that
you
can
find
that
fair
and
impartial
jury.
i
think
in
any
--
i
think
we
would
say
that
in
any
community
in
which
there
is
4
and
a
half
million
people,
there
may,
in
fact,
be
12
individuals
who
aren't
so
biased
that
they
can't
sit.
the
real
danger,
though,
is
that
the
ordinary
process
of
voir
dire,
as
this
court's
decisions
repeatedly
recognize,
in
mu'min,
in
patton,
and
murphy
and
others,
the
ordinary
process
of
voir
dire
in
that
situation
can't
be
trusted
to
identify
those
people.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
that's
the
danger
here.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
no.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect,
that's
not
--
that's
not
the
only
danger.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
part
of
it,
but
i
think
there's
--
there's
other
ones
that
we
would
put
forward
before
that
one.
there's
two
in
particular:
first,
in
a
community
like
houston,
in
the
state
of
the
--
the
passion
and
prejudice
that
existed
in
houston
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
there's
a
real
concern
that
jurors
will
not
feel
fully
free
to
return
to
that
community
delivering
anything
other
than
the
conviction
for
which
the
--
the
community
desires.
and
that,
i
think,
is
an
important
concern
that
this
court's
decisions
identify.
and
the
other
one,
and
this
is
in
murphy
in
particular,
where
there's
a
substantial
share
of
the
community
that's
impassioned
and
prejudiced,
as
this
one
was,
there's
a
concern
that
even
jurors
who
don't
lay
bare
--
who
don't
affirmatively
acknowledge
their
biases
--
are
unwittingly
subject
to
the
same
biases
that
permeate
the
community.
and
that
sort
of
danger
is
--
is
the
reason
that
in
these
situations,
we
think
transfer
is
required.
but
even
if
transfer
wasn't
required,
what
needed
to
happen
was
a
more
extensive
and
intensive
voir
dire
than
happened
here.
the
voir
dire
was
deficient
--
and
justice
ginsburg,
this
gets
back
to
your
question
about
juror
63.
the
voir
dire
was
deficient
in
at
least
this
respect.
in
conditions
like
those
that
permeated
houston,
we
think
it's
error
to
accept
the
assurance
of
fairness
of
a
juror
who
has
already
laid
bare
their
biases.
now,
juror
63,
for
example,
she
said
she
thinks
she
knew
that
jeff
skilling
--
she
thinks
that
jeff
skilling
knew
he
was
breaking
the
law.
this
is
someone
as
to
whom
we
ought
to
be
very
concerned.
in
our
view,
that
person
shouldn't
get--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
--
there
wasn't
a
specific
challenge
for
cause
against
her,
your
honor,
but
--
but
again,
we
challenged
everybody
on
the
basis
that
voir
dire
wouldn't
adequately
ferret
out
biases
in
this
case.
and
then
we
did
challenge
--
as
justice
sotomayor's
question
about
the
six
specific
challenges
that
we
lodged
at
the
close
of
the
voir
dire,
but
before
the
jurors
were
sworn
--
juror
63
was
one
of
those
jurors.
and
so
i
think
it
was
evident
that
juror
63
was
not
at
all
somebody
who
we
were
satisfied
with.
and
the
reason
is,
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
--
at
the
voir
dire
colloquy
with
her,
the
trial
court
asked
her
about
that
statement
and
asked
her:
you
remember
making
this
statement?
do
you
still
feel
that
way?
and
her
response
was:
i
don't
know.
and
then
she
acknowledged:
i
have
no
further
information
to
bring
to
bear
on
that
question
than
i
did
then.
and
at
that
point,
she
has
only
fortified
the
bias
that
she
brought
with
her,
but
the
trial
court
was
unsatisfied,
and
he
continued
to
press.
and
then
he
asked
her
at
some
point:
can
you
apply
the
presumption
of
innocence?
and
she
said
yes.
and
then
that
was
it.
but
in
our
view,
a
--
a
search
for
a
--
what
i
think
can
fairly
be
described
as
a
rote
assurance
of
fairness
can't
be
sufficient,
given
the
very
evident
danger
that
someone
like
juror
63,
who
has
already
laid
bare
her
biases,
would
bring
her
biases
with
her
to
the
panel
when
she
adjudicated
petitioner's
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
breyer,
it
is
by
nature
a
contextual
inquiry.
the
standard
that
this
court
has
articulated
to
identify
the
circumstances
in
which
this
sort
of
extra
--
i
think
--
precaution
is
necessary
is
that
there
has
to
be,
a
quote,
"wave
of
public
passion",
close
quote,
and
that's
the
language
that
the
court
has
used
in
a
number
of
its
decisions.
now,
that
may--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry.
go
ahead,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
--
i
--
anticipating
what
you
might
feel,
which
is
that
that
language
may
not
be
self-evident
as
to
the
circumstances
in
which
a
deeper
inquiry
is--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes,
and
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--wave--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--wave
of
public
passion,
and
i
guess
the
substrata
that
i
would
put
beneath
that,
especially
for
this
category
of
cases,
is
pervasive
animus
directed
towards
the
defendant
as
responsible
for
a
harm
felt
by
the
entire
community.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
what
the
trial
court
has
to
do
is
two
things,
your
honor:
first,
for
a
juror
who
has
laid
bare
his
or
her
biases,
that
juror
should
not
be
allowed
on
the
panel,
and
an
assurance
of
fairness
from
that
sort
of
juror
isn't
enough.
at
the
very
least,
your
honor,
on
this
category
--
and
then
i'll
go
to
my
second
point
--
in
a
situation
in
which
a
juror
has
laid
bare
his
or
her
biases,
we
think
that
juror
shouldn't
be
seated.
but
if
you're
going
to
entertain
the
thought
of
seating
that
person,
at
the
very
least
this
has
to
happen:
they
have
to
be
forced
to
confront
their
assurance
of
fairness
as
against
the
many
statements
of
bias
that
they
may
have
uttered.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
to
be
clear,
justice
breyer,
that
ordinary
practice
would
only
be
altered
in
the
very
rare
category
of
cases
that
involve
a
wave
of
public
passion.
and
--
and
they
would
be
altered
in
the
following
respect:
that
if
somebody
had
laid
bare
their
biases,
the
--
in
our
view,
what
should
happen
is
that
you
should
move
to
the
next
juror.
but
even
if
you
didn't
do
that,
at
least
the
following
should
happen,
justice
breyer,
and
that
is
that
when
somebody
utters
an
assurance
of
fairness,
that
itself
shouldn't
be
enough
when
the
community
is
permeated
with
the
sorts
of
biases
that
attended
this
proceeding.
the
jurors
should
at
least
be
forced
to
reconcile
their
previous
statements
of
bias
with
their
utterance
of
fairness.
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
this:
that
the
danger
that
this
court
has
identified
in
conditions
like
those
that
pervaded
the
houston
community
is
that
even
with
prospective
jurors
who
don't
affirmatively
acknowledge
their
biases,
there's
a
danger
that
they
may
have
biases
they
haven't
brought
to
the
fore.
and
we
think
what
can't
happen
is
what
the
trial
judge
did
in
this
case,
which
is
to
refuse
to
question
any
of
the
jurors
on
the
basis
of
any
response
they
gave
in
the
questionnaire,
other
than
responses
that
raised
a
red
flag.
and
we
think
if
you
curtail
the
inquiry
in
that
regard,
it
doesn't
allow
for
the
sort
of
voir
dire
that's
necessary
to
in
order
to
be--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--in
order
to
ferret
out
biases
that
may
be
latent.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
are,
justice
sotomayor.
there's
at
r
12036,
i
think,
is
an--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry.
r
12036
is
an
important
document,
which
is
our
renewed
motion
for
change
of
venue
and
related
relief.
and
that
was
after
the
questionnaire
responses
had
been
received.
and
the
point
we
made
in
that
document
is
that
as
a
consequence
of
the
questionnaire
responses,
we
already
knew
that
a
great
deal
of
bias
permeated
the
venire.
and
we
proposed
not
only
that
the
proceedings
should
be
transferred,
but
also
that
a
different
sort
of
voir
dire
should
be
conducted
than
the
one
that
the
trial
court
envisioned.
and
we
laid
out
in
that
motion
the
sorts
of
things
that
we
thought
should
be
done.
and
we
did
that
in
other
places
as
well,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
would
be
a
good
place
to
look.
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
part
of
the
problem
with
that
sort
of
rendition
is
that
that
--
i
think
nobody
suggests
that
any
dishonest
conduct
falls
within
the
compass
of
this
law,
that
no
pre-mcnally
case
suggests
that.
and
i
think
the
government
doesn't
takes
that
position,
either.
if
it
did--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
i
don't
think
that
you've
advanced
the
ball,
with
all
due
respect,
that
much
by
saying
there
has
a
right
to
honest
services,
because
i
think
what
--
at
the
end
of
the
day,
what
that
would
mean
is
that
any
situation
in
which
there's
a
fiduciary
duty
or
even
if
there's
not
a
fiduciary
duty,
but
at
least
any
situation
in
which
there
is
a
fiduciary
duty,
a
nondisclosure
of
deception
would
give
rise
to
a
federal
felony
prosecution.
and
that
has
never
been
the
understanding
under
pre-mcnally
case
law,
and
that
shouldn't
be
the
understanding
now,
because
its
sweep
is
breathtaking,
and
it's
not
something
that
we
would
ordinarily
construe
congress
to
have
intended.
now,
i
think
in
--
in
this
case,
there's
several
objections
we
have
to
the
application
of
the
honest
services
fraud
statute
to
this
case.
we
think
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
we
think
it's
particularly
vague
as
applies
to
--
as
applied
to
anything
beyond
the
narrow
category
of
bribes
and
kickbacks.
but
i
think
in
some
ways
the
most
straightforward
way
to
understand
why
the
honest
services
fraud
statute
can't
be
applied
validly
in
this
case
is
to
appreciate
what
i
think
is
an
evolution
in
the
government's
theory.
and
--
and
at
the
time
of
weyhrauch
--
and
this
is
at
page
48
of
the
government's
brief
in
weyhrauch,
just
a
few
months
ago.
the
government
said
that
the
honest
services
fraud
statute,
quote,
"nor
does
it
cover
an
official
whose
interest
is
public
knowledge.
"
so,
at
that
point,
i
think
we
--
we
would
have
believed
that
the
honest
services
fraud
statute
can't
be
applied
to
jeff
skilling,
because
his
interest,
as
the
government
acknowledges,
was
public
knowledge.
but
the
position
that
the
government
has
taken
now
is
that
even
though
his
interest
was
disclosed,
he
didn't
disclose
that
he
was
acting
in
pursuit
of
that
interest
at
the
expense
of
the
employer's
interests,
which
i
read
to
be
contrary
to
the
position
that
they
took
in
the
weyhrauch
case
and,
i
think,
which
is
problematic
in
two
respects.
first,
there
is
no
pre-mcnally
understanding,
none,
that
a
disclosed
interest
can
give
rise
to
honest
services
liability.
and,
second,
and
maybe
more
importantly--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--a
disclosed
interest,
where
the
interest
is
disclosed.
all
the
cases
dealt
with
situations
in
which
the
interest
is
undisclosed,
as
the
government
suggested
would
be
the
case
in
the
weyhrauch
brief.
but
--
but
perhaps
even
more
importantly,
there
is
no
pre-mcnally
understanding
to
the
effect
that
acting
in
pursuit
of
an
interest
in
compensation
can
give
rise
to
honest
services
liability.
and,
in
fact,
in
a
post-mcnally
case,
the
thompson
case
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
judge
easterbrook,
we
think,
explained
persuasively
why
pursuit
of
an
interest
in
personal
compensation
shouldn't
afford
the
gravamen
of--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--an
honest
services
prosecution.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
government's
theory
on
how
the
honest
services
fraud
statute
applies
in
this
case
is
laid
out
at
page
49
and
50.
and
the
interest
that
the
government
identifies
that
was
furthered
by
petitioner
skilling's
action
is
his
interest
in
compensation.
that's
--
that's
how
the
government,
i
think,
describes
it.
and
the
--
it's
true,
your
honor--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--of
the
government's
brief.
and
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
the
deception
that
they
identify
has
to
do
with
securities
fraud.
and
i'll
bracket
for
the
moment
that
we
think
that
the
honest
services
fraud
theory
that
was
put
before
the
jury
is
not
at
all
commensurate
with
the
one
that's
being
asserted
now.
but
even
if
you
take
as
a
given
that
it's
the
theory
now,
the
elements
of
honest
services
fraud
under
the
government's
theory
are
that
the
individual
would
act
in
pursuit
of
his
interest
in
his
own
compensation
at
the
expense
of
the
employer's
interests
in
acquiring
better
information
with
which
to
make
an
informed
decision.
and
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
we
see
with
that
approach
is
that
it
would
threaten
to
convert
almost
any
lie
in
the
workplace
into
an
honest
services
fraud
prosecution
for
the
following--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
--
it
does,
your
honor,
but
the
interest
at
issue
--
and
i'm
reading
from
page
50.
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
50.
the
government
says,
"that
constitute"
--
"that
conduct
constituted
fraud".
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
public
nature
of
petitioner's
compensation
scheme
prevents
his
conduct
from
constituting
honest
services
fraud.
"and
then
they
go
on":
although
the
"--"
although
petitioner's
basic
compensation
scheme
was
public,
his
scheme
to
artificially
inflate
the
company's
stock
price
by
misrepresenting
its
financial
condition,
in
order
to
derive
additional
personal
benefits
"--
i.e.,
his
compensation
--.
"
at
the
expense
of
shareholders,
was
not
"disclosed.
"
"so
i
think
the
theory
of
application
here
is
that
because
he
was
acting
allegedly--
"
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--because
the
stock
is
the
compensation,
your
honor.
there's
--
there's
no
--
i
think,
in
this
sort
of
situation,
there's
not
a
disaggregation
between
the
stock
and
the
compensation.
the
stock
was
intimately
tied
to
his
compensation,
and
the
personal
benefit
that,
i
think,
was
being
received
was
that
compensation
interest.
i
mean,
the
government
can
clarify
that,
but
that's
my
understanding
of
the
government's
view.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
the
danger
with
that
theory
is
that
it
would
have
the
capacity
to
convert
almost
any
workplace
lie
into
a
federal
felony,
for
the
following
reason:
that,
in
a
variety
of
situations,
an
employee
might
--
might
engage
in
an
act
of
deception
to
his
employer
with
respect
to
a
work-related
matter.
for
example,
suppose
that
there
is
an
employer
policy
that
says
you
can
only
use
workplace
computers
for
business
purposes,
and
when
asked,
the
employee
says
that
he
is
only
using
it
for
business
purposes,
but
he
is
in
fact
using
it
for
personal
reasons.
well,
at
that
point
he
will
have
made
a
deception
to
the
employer.
arguably,
it
would
be
material,
particularly
given
that
it
acts
in
the
face
of
an
employer
policy,
and
it
arguably
was
made
in
furtherance
of
the
employer's
personal
interest
in
maximizing
his
compensation
at
the
expense
of
the
--
at
the
expense
of
the
employer's
interests
in
having
better
information
with
which
to
make
an
informed
decision
about
the
employee's
future.
so
for
that
reason
as
well,
we
think
that
the
application
of
the
honest
services
fraud--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
there
are
two
different
arguments,
your
honor.
our
threshold
submission
is
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague,
and
we
believe
that
it's
particularly
vague
as
applied
to
a
category
that
extends
beyond
bribes
and
kickbacks.
and
i
haven't
been
through
those
arguments,
but
they're
--
they're
spelled
out
in
our
briefs.
now,
with
respect
to
the
remaining
category,
which
is
undisclosed
self-dealing,
even
that
category
we
think
is
a
problem
in
and
of
itself.
but
it's
particularly
problematic
when
it's
applied
to
the
realm
of
compensation
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
outlined.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
of
quick
points
on
the
honest
services
fraud
issue,
and
then
a
couple
of
points
on
the
juror
issue,
if
i
might.
with
respect
to
honest
services
fraud,
first
of
all,
i
think
that
the
government
pointed
to
the
jury
instruction
--
and,
justice
ginsburg,
this
goes
to
some
questions
that
you
had
raised
--
i
think
what's
clear
from
the
capacious
nature
of
the
jury
instruction
that
was
issued
in
this
case
is
that
the
elements
that
the
government
say
make
jeff
skilling
guilty
of
honest
services
fraud
weren't
put
before
the
jury
or
required
to
be
found
by
the
jury.
and
for
that
reason
alone,
the
conviction
against
jeff
skilling
ought
to
be
overturned.
another
point
i'd
make
very
quickly
with
respect
to
the
sweep
of
the
government's
theory
concerning
the
workplace
is,
under
our
understanding,
the
duty
of
loyalty
does
extend
to
all
employees.
it
does,
and,
therefore,
the
theory
that
they
assert
should
apply
in
this
case,
i
think,
has
devastating
implications
for
workplace
relations.
now,
with
respect
to
the
juror
question,
a
couple
of
preliminary
points,
and
then
i'd
like
to
walk
the
court
through
just
one
aspect
of
the
voir
dire
which
i
think
exhibits
the
manifest
flaws
in
the
process
the
trial
court
conducted.
with
respect
to
the
question
about
the
issuance
of
questionnaires,
questionnaires
were
also
issued
in
the
timothy
mcveigh
case.
but
i
don't
want
to
limit
our
comparison
to
timothy
mcveigh,
because
i
think
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised,
i
don't
want
to
leave
an
impression
that
a
multiple-day
voir
dire
with
the
sort
of
extensive
questioning
that
we
think
was
required
here
is
not
in
use
in
other
cases
that
involve
like
crimes.
in
the
martha
stewart
case,
for
example,
which
was
a
financial
case,
there
were
6
days
of
voir
dire
and
after
a
questionnaire
was
issued.
and
in
that
case,
the
only
reason
you
needed
an
extended
voir
dire
was
because
of
the
celebrity
status
of
the
defendant.
you
didn't
have
the
deep-seated
community
passion
and
prejudice
that
characterized
the
houston
venue
in
this
case.
so,
i
think
it's
not
at
all
unusual
to
have
that
kind
of
extended
voir
dire,
and,
in
fact,
we
would
say
it's
absolutely
necessary
to
assure
that
the
defendant
receives
the
fair
and
impartial
jury
to
which
he's
entitled.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
the
former
rather
than
the
latter--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
you
don't
necessarily
need
all
of
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
with
respect
to
the
way
in
which
the
district
court,
in
fact,
conducted
this
voir
dire,
if
i
could
just
take
--
if
i
could
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to
one
juror
in
particular
--
and,
justice
breyer,
this
is
--
maps
onto
some
of
the
points
you
were
making.
this
is
juror
61,
and
the
relevant
exchange
is
at
pages
931a
to
932a
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
at
--
in
--
in
volume
2.
and
i
think
the
way
the
trial
court
conducted
the
voir
dire
in
this
case
exhibits
the
manifest
flaws
in
his
approach
generally.
this
is
someone
who
at
page
932a,
it's
revealed,
answered
the
question
whether
she
was
angry,
whether
there
was
anger
about
enron,
with
yes,
quote
--
it
was,
quote,
"based
out
of
greed,
hurt
a
lot
of
innocent
people.
"
and
to
paint
the
picture
more
fully,
the
person
was
also
asked:
do
you
have
an
opinion
about
the
collapse
of
enron?
to
which
the
answer
was,
quote,
"yes,
criminal,
caused
a
huge
shock
wave
which
the
entire
community
felt.
"
close
quote.
now,
at
931a
at
the
top,
she
was
asked
the
question
whether
she
had
the
opinion
about
mr.
lay
and
her
answer
was,
quote,
"shame
on
him".
and
then
much
of
this
was
put
before
her
in
the
course
of
the
voir
dire.
in
the

932a,
the
first
answer
--
she's
asked
the
question:
"can
you
presume
as
you
start
this
trial
that
mr.
lay
is
innocent?
"
the
answer
is,
"i
hope
so,
but
you
know,
i
don't
know.
"
"i
can't
honestly
answer
that
one
way
or
another.
"
mr.
sri
srinivasan
not
until--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
not
--
not
until
this
happens
first,
justice
breyer,
between
932a
and
933a.
and
so
she's
asked,
"so
that
might
--
might
your
views
about
ken
lay
cloud
your
judgment
relative
to
criminal
responsibility?
"
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
her
answer
is--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
believe
that
they
are.
i
think
that
they're
certainly
in
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals.
so
i
think
that
they
are.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you.
