do
you
really
think
that
if
--
if
there
had
been
a
much
more
lengthy
voir
dire
and
if
the
trial
judge
had
been
more
willing
to
--
to
grant
motions
to
dismiss
for
cause,
that
it
would
have
--
that
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
find
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
in
the
district?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
rule
21
says
that
the
judge
must
grant
a
transfer
if
the
judge
is
satisfied
that
a
prejudice
against
--
that
so
great
a
prejudice
against
the
defendant
exists
in
the
transferring
district
that
the
defendant
cannot
obtain
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
there.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
if
you
could
find
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
with
an
adequate
voir
dire,
then
the
transfer
need
not
be
granted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
were
there
any
pre-mcnally
cases
that
involved
a
situation
like
this,
where
the
benefit
to
the
employee
was
in
the
form
of
the
employee's
disclosed
compensation?
