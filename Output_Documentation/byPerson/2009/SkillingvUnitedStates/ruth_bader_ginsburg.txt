he
asked

justice

you
made
a
change
of
venue
motion
at
the
outset,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i'm
unaware
of
any
case
in
which
we
have
said
a
change
is
mandatory
when
what's
involved
is
money
rather
than
life
or
limb.
life
or
limb
obviously
was
involved
in
the
mcveigh
case.
justice

well,
what
was
remarkable
about
some
of
those
questionnaires,
there
were
a
lot
of
people
didn't
read
the
newspapers.
there
were
a
lot
of
people
who
indicated
they
really
didn't
know
anything
about
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader

but
there
was
some
follow-up
to
that.
justice
ruth
bader

was
there
a
challenge
for
cause
against

justice
ruth
bader

and
i
thought
part
of
the
government's
theory
was
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wasn't
limited
to
the
compensation.
it
was
essentially
skilling
owned
shares,
and
he
had
information
that
those
shares
were
inflated.
shareholders
owned
shares.
they
didn't
have
that
information.
skilling
then
sold
those
shares
at
a
great
profit
to
himself.
and
the
shareholders
were
left
without
that
information.
and
then
when
the
stock
price
plummeted,
they
all
lost
out.
i
thought
that
the
government
was
not
limiting
the
--
its
position
to
the
compensation,
but
was
also
dealing
with
the
share
price.
justice
ruth
bader

may
i
--
i
just
don't
--
because
i'm
looking
at
page

i
thought
this
discussion
goes
from
50
to
52,
and
that
the
part
on
52
certainly
homes
in
on
the
share
--
the

justice

why
--
why
do
you
put

additional

could
be

justice

i
think
we'll
ask

to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader

what
was
--
mr.
dreeben,
what
was
the
jury
told
when
this
honest

count
was
given
to
the
jury?
what
was
--
what
were
they
told
was
the
definition--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dreeben,
would
you
clarify
the
issue
that
came
up:
is
the
government's
theory
focused
simply
on
the
compensation
or
does
it
involve
the
sale
of

justice

first
of
the
decisions
i
will
announce
is
number
08-1394
skilling
v.
united
states.
in
2001,
enron
corporation,
then
one
of
the
world's
leading
energy
companies
crashed
into
bankruptcy.
this
opinion
considers
two
questions
arising
from
the
prosecution
of
jeffrey
skilling,
a
longtime
top
enron
executive,
for
crimes
committed
before
the
corporation's
collapse.
first,
did
pretrial
publicity
and
community
prejudice
prevent
skilling
from
obtaining
the
fair
trial
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
and
second,
was
skilling
properly
charged
with
and
convicted
of
conspiracy
to
commit
honest
services
wire
fraud.
the
fifth
circuit
answering
no
to
the
first
question
and
yes
to
the
second,
affirmed
skilling's
convictions.
we
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit's
ruling
on
skilling's
fair
trial
claim,
but
we
disagree
with
that
court’s
opinion
on
skilling's
honest
services
conviction.
we
therefore
affirm
in
part
and
vacate
in
part.
on
the
fair
trial
issue,
skilling
argues
that
his
prosecution
never
should
have
proceeded
in
houston,
enron's
home
base.
pointing
to
the
heavy
media
coverage
and
the
community
outrage
attending
enron's
collapse,
he
urges
this
court
to
presume
that
prejudice
infected
his
jury.
critical
differences,
however,
separate
skilling's
trial
from
those
in
which
we
have
presumed
juror
prejudice.
first
in
contrast
to
the
small-town
settings
at
issue
in
prior
cases,
houston
is
the
fourth
most
populous
city
in
the
nation,
the
suggestion
that
12
impartial
jurors
could
not
be
found
there
is
hard
to
sustain.
second,
news
stories
about
skilling
reported
no
smoking
gun
evidence,
nothing
comparable
to
the
murder
confessions
broadcast
in
prior
cases.
third,
media
attention
diminished
somewhat
in
the
four
years
between
enron's
collapse
and
skilling’s
trial
and
finally
skilling's
jury
acquitted
him
of
nine
insider
trading
charges.
those
not
guilty
verdicts
hardly
suggested
jury
incapable
of
weighing
the
evidence
impartially.
we
conclude
in
short
that
no
presumption
of
prejudice
should
have
disqualified
houston
as
a
place
appropriate
for
skilling's
trial.
we
further
hold
that
no
actual
prejudice
contaminated
skilling's
jury.
the
jury
selection
process,
we
are
satisfied,
adequately
detected
and
defused
potential
juror
bias.
the
district
court
initially
screened
venire
members
by
using
a
comprehensive
questionnaire
drafted
in
large
part
by
skilling’s
counsel.
that
77-question,
14-page
document
was
designed
to
probe
potential
jurors’
exposure
to
pretrial
publicity
and
their
opinions
about
enron
and
skilling.
during
voir
dire
the
court
questioned
each
venire
member
individually,
focusing
on
questionnaire
answers
that
raised
a
red
flag
signaling
possible
bias.
once
done,
the
court
allowed
counsel
to
ask
follow-up
questions.
careful
consideration
of
the
questionnaires
and
voir
dire
of
the
seated
jurors
satisfies
us
that
the
fact
triers
in
skilling’s
case
were
largely
uninterested
in
and
personally
untouched
by
enron's
collapse.
accordingly
we
reject
skilling's
claim
that
he
was
denied
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
we
next
consider
whether
skilling
was
improperly
convicted
of
conspiracy
to
commit
honest
services
wire
fraud.
to
understand
how
honest
services
fraud
works,
consider
the
following
example.
a
mayor
accepts
a
bribe
from
a
third
party
in
exchange
for
awarding
that
party
a
city
contract.
if
the
contract
terms
are
the
same
as
any
that
could
have
been
negotiated
at
arm's
length,
the
city
suffers
no
tangible
loss
of
money
or
property,
but
the
citizens
are
harmed
because
they
have
been
deprived
of
their
right
to
the
mayor’s
honest
services.
beginning
in
the
1940s,
the
court
of
appeals
one
after
the
other
upheld
fraud
convictions
of
both
public
and
private
employees
based
on
facts
resembling
those
in
the
bribed
mayor's
example.
by
1982,
all
federal
appellate
courts
had
embraced
the
honest
services
theory
of
fraud.
in
1987,
this
court’s
decision
in
mcnally
v.
united
states
blew
the
whistle
on
honest
services
prosecutions.
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes,
we
held,
proscribed
only
deprivations
of
money
or
property
not
honest
services.
the
next
year
congress
enacted
18
u.s.c.
1346
to
override
mcnally.
that
statute
provides
that
the
term
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
are
used
--
as
used
in
the
mail
and
wire
fraud
proscriptions,
includes
a
scheme
or
artifice
to
deprive
another
of
the
intangible
right
of
honest
services.
skilling
contends
that
the
honest
services
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
therefore
violates
due
process.
his
vagueness
challenge
we
acknowledge
has
force.
no
doubt
congress
intended
section
1346
to
reinstate
pre-mcnally
honest
services'
decisions,
but
those
decisions
are
hardly
models
of
clarity
or
consistency.
nevertheless,
the
court
must,
if
possible,
salvage
not
condemn
congress’
enactments.
section
1346,
we
conclude,
is
amenable
to
a
reasonably
confined
construction,
one
that
limits
the
statute
scope
to
the
paradigm
pre-mcnally
cases.
the
vast
majority
of
the
pre-mcnally
honest
services
prosecutions
involved
offenders
who
in
violation
of
a
fiduciary
duty
participated
in
bribery
or
kickback
schemes.
indeed
mcnally
itself,
the
case
which
spurred
congress
to
enact
1346,
presented
a
classic
kickback
scheme.
beyond
doubt,
congress
intended
1346
to
reach
at
least
bribes
and
kickbacks
engineered
by
persons
in
positions
of
trust.
leaving
the
statute
to
proscribe
a
wider
range
of
offensive
conduct,
we
acknowledge,
would
raise
due
process
concerns.
to
save
the
statute
of
running
afoul
of
constitutional
limitations,
we
now
hold
that
section
1346
criminalizes
only
the
bribe
and
kickback
hoar
of
the
pre-mcnally
case
law.
because
skilling's
misconduct
entailed
no
bribe
or
kickback,
he
did
not
conspire
to
commit
honest
services
fraud
under
our
confined
construction
of
1346.
we
leave
for
remand
the
question
whether
the
error
is
harmless
in
light
of
other
theories
supportive
of
skilling’s
conspiracy
conviction.
