mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
judge
lake
approached
this
case
with
the
question
of
how
to
select
a
jury,
he
had
15
years
of
experience
in
selecting
juries,
and
he
informed
the
parties
that
it
was
his
experience
that
voir
dire
conducted
by
the
trial
judge
is
more
effective
at
eliciting
the
potential
biases
of
a
juror
than
the
oftentimes
tendentious
voir
dire
that's
conducted
by
the
parties.
he
did
not
ignore
the
fact
that
the
enron
collapse
had
a
significant
impact
on
the
houston
community.
he
worked
with
the
parties
to
develop
a
14
--
page
questionnaire,
which
i
encourage
the
court
to
look
at,
if
the
court
has
not
already
done
so.
it's
extraordinarily
detailed.
it
has
more
than
70
questions
designed
to
ferret
out
any
possible
connections
between
the
individual
jurors
and
the
enron
collapse.
it
asked
for
their
views
about
the
enron
collapse.
it
asked
for
whether--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--judge
--
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
length
of
voir
dire
in
particular
cases.
but
i
think
that
there
is
no--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
problem
with
this
voir
dire,
and
i
think
there
is
really--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
there
was
a
fair
trial
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
a
full
reading
of
the
voir
dire
reveals
that
individuals
sitting
from
this
vantage
point
with
a
cold
record
who
were
not
there
may
have
different
viewpoints
about--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
there's
any
per
se
disqualification.
but
even
if
there
was,
that
juror
did
not
sit,
and
this
court
held
in
united
states
v.
martinez-salazar
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
peremptories
is
to
protect
against
the
occasional
accidental
error.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
none
sat
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
claim
that
they
did.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that
a
--
what
this
court
may
perceive
as
an
error
in
the
denial
of
one
for-cause
challenge--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
reading
the
entire
voir
dire
reflects
that
the
judge
was
interested
in
determining
whether
these
jurors
were
qualified
to
sit.
he
was
not
interested
in
having
the
voir
dire
used
as
a
lobbying
or
a
argumentative
exercise
by
the
lawyers.
and
as
a
result,
he
relied
on
the
very
extensive
questionnaires
to
pinpoint
the
examples
of
areas
in
which
further
questioning
was
necessary.
and
then
he
went
and
he,
i
think,
did
fairly
allow
sufficient
inquiry
into
whether
these
jurors
could
sit.
and
i
think
one
of
the
best
examples
of
that
is
actually
juror
number
63,
who
petitioner
says
was
not
properly
voir-dired.
and
i
think
what
juror
number
63
illustrates
--
and
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
935a
and
then
following
--
is
that,
as
this
court
has
remarked
many
times,
the
question
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--935a.
this
is
in
volume
2
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
did
not
challenge
63
for
cause,
but
they
--
but
they
came
to
this
court
today
and
tried
to
use
63
as
an
object
lesson
of
what
was
wrong
with
the
voir
dire.
i
actually
think
juror
63
illustrates
not
only
what
was
right
with
the
voir
dire,
but
the
immense
distortion
that
petitioners
have
attempted
to
perpetrate
by
putting
together
effectively
a
highlight
reel
of
every
bad
headline
in
every
houston
publication
and
claiming
that
the
entire
jurisdiction,
all
4.5
million
people
virtually,
were
infected
with
some
sort
of
a
pervasive
prejudice
that
could
not
be
ferreted
out
in
voir
dire.
if
you
look
at
what
happened
in
juror
number
63,
she
happens
to
be
a
24-year-old
who
comes
to
court.
she
filled
out
a
questionnaire
that
she
said:
i
can
be
impartial.
she
did
have
the
statement:
i
--
i
think
that
probably
skilling
is
guilty
of
some
crime.
when
the
voir
dire
proceeds,
it
turns
out
that
she's
not
one
of
these
jurors
who
has
been
in
the
houston
culture
pervasively
exposed
to
what
petitioner
says
is
prejudicial
publicity.
she
was
living
in
austin
at
the
time,
going
to
school.
then
she's
asked,
"are
you
watching
major
networks"?
and
she
says,
"no,
i
don't
really
watch
the
news
at
all.
"
"i'm
a
turtle
person.
"
"do
you
recall
anything
that
may
have
--
you've
seen
--
that
you
may
have
seen
or
heard
on
television
about
this
case?
"
"no".
and
then
the
judge,
after
some
more
questioning
about
her
that
reveals
that,
among
other
things,
ken
lay
is
a
member
of
the
country
club
that
her
parents
belong
to,
he
asks
her
about
the
very
question
that
petitioners
focus
on
as
problematic:
"do
you
have
any
opinion
about
the
guilt
or
innocence
--
and
you
say,
i
think
they
probably
were
breaking
the
law?
"
and
her
answer
is:
"i
don't
know.
"
"the
only
thing
i
can
say
is,
anything
i've
ever
heard
even
peripherally
has
not
been,
you
know
--
but
that's
what
people
say
and,
i
mean,
it's
hard
to
know.
"
"people
don't
know
what
they
are
talking
about.
"
and
the
judge
says,
"well,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
you
think.
"
she
says,
"i
don't
have
an
opinion
either
way.
"
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
breyer,
this
court
has
recognized
--
and
it
has
recognized
this
as
long
ago
as
chief
justice
marshall
in
the
burr
case
--
that
people
come
to
court
with
opinions
in
highly
publicized
cases.
we
expect
our
jurors
to
be
somewhat
informed
of
civic
affairs.
they
receive
information
through
the
media
or
through
their
friends,
and
they
have
light
opinions.
and
they
come
to
court,
and
the
trial
judge
instructs
them:
this
is
a
legal
proceeding;
you're
going
to
hear
evidence
in
court.
what
happened
outside
of
the
courtroom
no
longer
matters.
what
matters
is
what
has
been
presented
in
here.
i'm
going
to
instruct
you
that
defendants
have
a
presumption
of
innocence.
can
you
follow
that?
and
then
the
judge
is
the
only
person
on
the
scene.
we're
not
there,
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
there;
the
judge
is
the
only
person
on
the
scene
to
judge
the
jurors'
inflection,
the
jurors'
demeanor,
the
jurors'
apprehension
of
the
seriousness
of
the
duty.
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
standard
for
review
of
a
determination
of
no
removable
bias
for
cause
is
manifest
error.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
were
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
this
was
not
a
case
like
mu'min,
where
in
your
concurrence
--
your
dissent,
you
pointed
out
that
the
colloquy
occurred
in
the
full
presence
of
the
--
of
every
other
juror,
and
there
was
no
individualized
voir
dire.
here
there
was
individualized
voir
dire.
judge
lake
had
that
juror
right
in
front
of
him,
eyeball
to
eyeball,
and
was
able
to
make
the
kind
of
credibility
assessment,
taking
into
account
all
of
the
context,
that
no
other
judge
can
do.
and
it's
not
to
say
that
there's
no
judicial
review
of
that
on
appeal.
in
the
irvin
case,
irvin
v.
dowd,
which
is
really
the
court's
first
case
in
this
line,
the
court
noticed
that
there
--
90
percent
of
the
jurors
had
an
opinion
that
the
defendant
was
guilty.
it
involved
a
highly
sensationalized
murder
in
rural
counties
in
southern
indiana.
there
was
a
barrage
of
pretrial
publicity.
eight
of
the
12
jurors
said
they
had
an
opinion
that
the
defendant
was
guilty.
the
court,
after
meticulously
reviewing
the
voir
dire,
concluded
that
the
judge
had
committed
manifest
error
in
accepting
the
representations
of
the
jurors
that
they
could
be
impartial.
but
this
is
nothing
like
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
what
judge--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
--
i
think
that's
not
necessarily
correct
at
all,
and
it
would
not
have
been
the
case
that
in
a
normal
trial
there
would
have
been
as
detailed
a
14-page
questionnaire
as
there
was
in
this
case,
that
was
designed
to
elicit
any
and
all
connections
to
enron.
now,
whether
there
may
have
been
some
individualized
mistakes
along
the
way,
whether
some
of
us
would
have
preferred
that
the
voir
dire
be
more
extensive,
is
not
the
issue;
and
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
set
standards
that
are
based
either
on
a
stopwatch
or
some
sort
of,
you
know,
notion
of
how
many
days
voir
dire
has
to
occur,
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
administer
a
standard
that
says
this
was
too
little.
the
oklahoma
city
bombing
case,
it
is
true,
took
many,
many
days,
but
that
was
a
capital
case,
and
i
know
that
this
court
is
well
familiar
that
there
are
numerous--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
did,
and
denver
itself
was
exposed,
probably
almost
as
much
as
oklahoma
city,
to
the
pretrial
publicity,
and
a
terrorist
act
of
that
magnitude,
mr.
chief
justice,
really
strikes
at
the
heart
of
the
entire
nation.
judge
matsch,
who
sits
in
denver--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--agreed.
it
was
168
deaths.
many
of
them
were
children.
there
was
a
sense
of
--
of
victimization
in
the
part
of
the
community
that
i
don't
think
is
comparable
to
what
happened
with
a
financial
meltdown
in
houston,
a
4.5
million
city
with
a
robust
economy
and
a
trial
that
took
place
4
years
later,
after
numerous
other
enron
trials
had
already
taken
place
in
houston,
resulting
in
favorable
verdicts
for
defendants,
mistrials,
acquittals
of
one
defendant.
this
very
trial
itself
of
mr.
skilling
resulted
in
nine
acquittals
on
insider
trading
counts.
now,
if
you
would
think
that
the
jury
had
some
sort
of
a
substratum
of
subterranean
bias
that
was
ineradicable
by
the
conventional
techniques
of
voir
dire
that
we
have
been
using
for
200
years,
then
insider
trading
where
the
defendant
pockets
personally,
as
a
result
of
the
exploitation
of
insider
information
--
you
would
think
that
would
be
the
first
place
the
jurors
would
go
to
vent--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
honest
services
component
actually,
and
the
component
of
this
trial,
was
really
a
subset
of
the
securities
fraud.
the
essential
gravamen
of
petitioner's
crimes
were
lying
to
enron,
lying
to
its
shareholders
about
the
health
of
the
company
in
a
financial
sense,
when,
in
fact,
he
knew
that
he
had
been
engaging
in
numerous
manipulations
of
earnings
and
schemes
that
are
detailed
in
the
briefs,
in
order
to
avoid
enron
having
to
recognize
that
portions
of
its
business
were
imploding.
and
the
victimization
was
of
shareholders.
that
was
expressed
through
securities
fraud;
it
was
expressed
through
insider
trading.
there
were
counts
involving
liars
--
lying
to
auditors,
and
one
object
of
a
multi-count
conspiracy
charge
involved
an
honest
services
object
as
well
as
a
money
or
property
fraud
object,
and
as
well
as
a
securities
fraud
object.
now,
in
our
view
petitioner
has
essentially
conceded
that
the
honest
services
statute
is
not
vague
as
applied
and,
therefore,
facially
unconstitutional.
he
all
but
acknowledges
that
bribes
and
kickbacks,
which
constitute
the
bulk
of
pre-mcnally
honest
services
cases,
can
be
defined
with
precision.
there
is
not
an
unconstitutional
vagueness
in
it.
and
so
i
think
at
a
minimum--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
the
court
needs
to
rewrite
the
statute
so
much
as
to
recognize
that
what
happened
in
mcnally
was
this
court
said
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
has
two
clauses,
scheme
to
defraud
and
scheme
for
obtaining
money
or
property
by
false
representations
and
pretenses.
the
government's
position,
in
accordance
with
all
of
the
lower
courts,
was
that
these
two
clauses
set
forth
two
separate
crimes.
scheme
to
defraud
was
not
limited
to
money
or
property.
this
court
disagreed,
and
it
said,
oh,
yes,
it
was.
and
what
congress
did
in
responding
was
to
invoke
words
that
had
appeared
in
this
court's
decision
in
mcnally,
in
the
dissent
written
by
justice
stevens,
in
the
lower
court
opinions,
and
intentionally
--
as
this
court
put
it
in
cleveland
v.
united
states
--
cover
one
of
the
intangible
rights
that
the
lower
courts
had
recognized
before
mcnally,
and
that
was
the
right
to
--
intangible
right
of
honest
services.
and
in
the
context
of
the
pre-mcnally
honest
services
cases,
that
was
well
known
to
include
at
its
core
the
bribery
and
kickback
cases
and,
in
the
additional
category,
nondisclosure
of
a
personal,
conflicting,
substantial
interest.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
this
is
not
like
a
statute,
justice
scalia,
that
says
prohibiting
any
bad
thing.
it's
a
statute
that
responded
to
a
decision
of
this
court
in
which
a
term
of
art,
the
intangible
right
of
honest
services,
featured
prominently.
and
congress
has--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
there
was
a
solid
enough
content
for
this
court
to
be
able
to
respond
to
the
mcnally
decision
by
giving
shape
to
the
crime
in
accordance
with
the
paradigm
cases
that
the
lower
courts
had
done
and
logical
implications
of
those
cases,
just
as
if
it
had
concluded,
in
accordance
with
justice
stevens's
dissent,
that
the
statute
did
protect
intangible
rights
in
the
phrase
"scheme
to
defraud".
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it's
a
term
of
art
in
the
sense
that
it
referred
to
a
--
a
body
of
law
that
until
quite
recently,
when
defendants
began
making
vagueness
arguments,
was
understood
to
refer
to
the
kinds
of
schemes
that
had
been
prosecuted
before
this
court
held
that
"scheme
to
defraud"
was
limited
to
money
or
property.
and
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it's
clear
enough
at
the
core,
this
court
can
say
so
and
can
provide
definition,
and
it
can
use
its
standard
tools
of
interpretation
of
criminal
statutes
to
dispose
of
cases
that
are
at
the
periphery
and
ensure
that
there
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it
puts
a
defendant
in
a
very
bad
position
at
all,
because
this
statute
is
only
triggered
when
there's
an
intent
to
deceive,
an
intentional
fraudulent
act
taken
to
deprive
the
victim
of
whatever
right
exists
in
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
jury
instruction,
justice
ginsburg,
appears
on
page
1086a
of
the
joint
appendix.
that's
in
volume
3
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
i
will
describe
the
jury
instruction,
too,
but
i
want
to
say
at
the
outset
that
this
jury
instruction
was
drafted
against
the
background
of
fifth
circuit
law,
which
i
think
did
take
a
somewhat
broader
view
of
the
honest
services
crime
than
the
government
has
taken
in
this
court,
and
it
has
to
be
read
against
that
background.
but
the
--
the
instruction
said
that
"to
show
that
defendants
deprived
enron
and
its
shareholders
of
their
right
of
honest
services,
the
government
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that,
in
rendering
some
particular
service
or
services,
the
defendant
knew
that
his
actions
were
not
in
the
best
interests
of
enron
and
its
shareholders
or
that
he
consciously
contemplated
or
intended
such
actions,
and
that
enron
and
its
shareholders
suffered
a
detriment
from
the
defendant's
breach
of
his
duty
to
render
honest
services.
"
so
--
and
this
was
against
a
background--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
--
i
would
agree,
justice
scalia.
i've
read
this
phrase
many
times,
and
it
does
seem
a
little
circular
to
me.
the
introduction
to
this
jury
instruction
says,
"honest
services
are
the
services
required
by
the
defendant's
fiduciary
duty
to
enron
and
its
shareholders
under
state
law.
"
so
this
was
tried
in
a
circuit
that
followed
the
state
law
principle
that's
at
issue
in
the
weyhrauch
case.
the
government
defined
the
fiduciary
duty
in
that
way.
but
the
essence
of
the
fraud
was
that
--
that
petitioner
had
a
fiduciary
duty
to
the
shareholders
of
enron
to
act
in
their
best
interests,
and
he
betrayed
that
by
acting
contrary
to
the
best
interests
of
the
shareholders,
fraudulently
upholding
the
price,
and
ultimately
that
constituted
the
crime.
now,
i
think
there's
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
whether
the
employee
had
a
fiduciary
duty
in
that
respect
would
be,
i
think,
quite
a
litigable
question.
this
case
doesn't
involve
any
subtle
or
arcane
fiduciary
duty.
this
is
one
of
the
basic
fiduciary
duties
that
any
chief
executive
has,
not
to
lie
to
shareholders
about
the
financial
condition
of
the
company.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
all
employees
are
fiduciaries,
no,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
most
fiduciaries
have
a
sort
of
heightened
duty
towards
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
it's
inherent
in
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
you
cannot
successfully
attempt
to
understand
congress's
reaction
to
this
court's
decision
in
mcnally
without
some
cognizance
of
the
mcnally
decision
and
the
preexisting
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
would
be
a
standard
agency
law
principle,
justice
kennedy,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--normally,
justice
kennedy,
no
such
complexities
are
necessary,
and
i
think
that
this
court
can
resolve
this
case
without
introducing
such
complexities,
because
the
core
duties
of
loyalty
that
have
formed
the
core
of
the
honest
services
prosecutions
are
universal.
they
are
equally
applicable
to
agency.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
that's
not
an
honest
services
case.
the
honest
services
cases
are
about
conflicting
interests
and
the
misuse
of
official
position.
i'm
not
even
sure,
in
the
personal
computer
use
case,
that
the
government
could
successfully
show
that
the
employee
had
misused
his
official
position.
this
case
is
quite
typical
in
that
respect.
petitioner
absolutely
misused
his
official
position
to
serve
what
we
say
was
his
private
interest
in
private
gain.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
were
not
to
my
knowledge,
justice
alito,
and
i
would
frankly
acknowledge
that
this
case
is
a
logical
extension
of
the
basic
principle
that
we
have
urged
the
court
to
adopt
in
the
nondisclosure
cases.
and
the
court
can
evaluate
whether
it
believes
that
that
is
legitimately
within
the
scope
of
an
honest
services
violation
or
not.
but
it
should
not
obscure
our
fundamental
submission,
which
is
that
there
was
a
definable
category
of
undisclosed
conflict
of
interest
cases,
that
a
person
furthered
through
his
official
actions
that
constituted
honest
services
fraud.
a
good
example
of
that
is
united
states
v.
keane,
which
was
a
seventh
circuit
decision.
petitioner,
in
his
reply
brief,
claims
that
keane
involved
financial
injury
to
chicago
as
a
result
of
an
alderman's
concealment
of
his
interest
in
properties
that
the
city
was
selling.
actually
there
were
three
separate
schemes
in
keane.
in
one
of
them,
the
court
was
quite
clear
that,
even
though
the
alderman
got
the
same
deal
that
every
member
of
the
public
would
have
gotten,
it
still
was
honest
services
fraud
because
he
did
not
disclose
his
financial
interest
in
that
property
to
the
council
when
the
council
was
voting
on
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
may
well
be,
justice
sotomayor.
it
depends,
i
think,
on
whether
the
tax
break
was
something
that
basically
all
general
members
of
the
public
were
in
a
position
to
benefit
from,
which
may
well
be
the
case
if
it's
just
a
private
residence,
versus
if
it's
a
particularized
business
property
interest
that
you
have
either
acquired--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
in
the
first
instance,
you
will
inevitably,
as
a
councilperson,
turn
to
your
local
law.
and
i
think
this
brings
up
an
important
point
that
was
discussed
in
the
weyhrauch
decision,
which
is
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
does
not
criminalize
breaches
of
duty
without
more.
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
scienter,
of
a
mens
rea
element
of
intent
to
deceive.
and
unless
the
government
can
point
to
something
which
shows
that
the
individual
knew
that
they
had
a
duty
to
disclose
and
did
not
do
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--or
--
if
i
could
just
finish
this
part
of
the
answer
--
or
can
point
to
circumvention-type
activity,
using
of
shell
companies
to
conceal
an
interest,
then
the
government
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
have
an
indictable
case
on
honest
services
fraud.
and
i
think
what--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases,
justice
scalia,
that
a
mens
rea
element
requiring
an
intent
to
deceive,
an
intent
to
violate
the
law,
is
exactly
what
helps
prevent
statutes
that
might
otherwise
be
considered
too
vague
from
falling--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
saying
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
saying
that
in
the
ordinary
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
what
happens,
justice
breyer,
is
that
unless
the
government
does
have
some
sort
of
legal
platform
like
that
to
show
that
there
was
knowledge
of
a
duty,
it's
not
possible
for
the
government
to
bring
its
proof
to
the
court
and
establish
that
the
individual
acted
with
the
requisite
mens
rea,
unless
there
is
activity
that
reveals
an
intent
to
circumvent
the
law
and
to
withhold
the
information,
as
in
justice
sotomayor's
example,
information
about
a
property
interest
that
might
well
affect
the
deliberations
of
the
council.
and
that
kind
of
evidence
often
requires
use
of
offshore
accounts--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
see
any
of
those--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
cases
in
which
this
has
happened,
there
is
--
there's
not
like
a
deliberation
on
somebody's
part
--
oh,
do
i
have
to
disclose
or
not
disclose?
what
these
cases
are,
are
really
outright
criminal
conduct
in
the
form
of
conflicting
interests
that
every
fiduciary
knows
you
need
to
disclose
this
before
you
take
official
action
to
further
that
interest.
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
involves
the
sale
of
shares
as
well.
that
was
part
of
the
compensation,
and
it's
linked
to
it.
but,
justice
ginsburg,
if
you
look
at
the
government's
opening
statement
in
this
case,
the
government
opened
by
saying,
"you
will
see
that
defendants
lay
and
skilling
knew
few
--
a
few
key
facts
about
the
true
condition
of
enron,
facts
that
the
investing
public
did
not
know.
"
"with
that
information,
defendants
lay
and
skilling
sold
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
their
own
enron
stock.
"
and
then
continued:
"when
an
investor
buys
a
share
of
stock,
an
investor
buys
some
rights
in
a
publicly
traded
company.
"
"when
an
investor
buys
a
share
of
stock,
they
buy
the
right
to
hear
and
receive
truth
from
the
chief
executive
officer.
"
"and,
importantly,
they
buy
the
right
to
have
their
interests
placed
ahead
of
the
chief
executor
officer
every
day
of
the
week.
"
so
there
was,
baked
into
this
case
at
the
outset,
the
notion
that
these
officials
were
not
acting
in
the
best
interests
of
the
shareholders.
they
were
furthering
their
own
interests
by
maintaining
a
high
stock
price
so
that
they
could
profit
from
it.
thank
you.
