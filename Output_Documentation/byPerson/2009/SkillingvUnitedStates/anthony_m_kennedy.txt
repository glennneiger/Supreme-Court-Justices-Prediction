excuse
me.
what
was
the
page?
nine--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--were
--
were
these
colloquies
that
are
reported,
the
--
the
pages
we
have
just
been
reviewing,
heard
by
the
entire
jury
pool?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
were
they
just
--
where
the
person
--
the
juror
was
standing
in
front
of
the
bench
for
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
that
the
voir
dire
would
have
been
much
shorter
even
if
there
had
been
no
showing
of
pervasive
prejudice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
five
hours
sounds
to
me
about
standard
for
a
case
of
this
difficulty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a
concession
that
a
bribe
or
a
kickback
scheme
statute
would
not
be
vague
is
hardly
a
concession
that
this
statute
as
written
is
not
vague.
in
fact,
i
thought
that
was
the
point.
the
point
is
that
the
court
shouldn't
rewrite
the
statute;
that's
for
the
congress
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
authority
do
i
look
to,
to
see
that
some
employees
are
fiduciaries
and
others
are
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
look
in
the
restatement
of
agency,
and
they
have
a
section
that
applies
to
fiduciaries
and
non-fiduciaries,
both
of
whom
are
employees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
assume
that
any
employee,
even
at
the
lowest
level
of
the
corporate
structure,
who
has
corporate
property,
a
car
or
something,
has
a
duty
to
protect
that
car
for
the
employer.
