justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
say
we
--
in
your
opinion,
if
we
agreed
with
your
basic
idea
--
if,
which
is
totally
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
agreed
with
that,
how
would
we
sketch
the
lines?
that
is,
when
does
the
jury
--
does
the
judge
have
to
do
more
than
is
ordinary,
and
what
counts
as
more
than
ordinary?
i
mean,
i
--
what
i
have
fear
of,
to
put
it
out
for
you,
is
that
jury
selection
can
go
on
a
very
long
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
judges
have
to
--
have
to
run
their
trials.
and
if
we
tell
the
judges
that
they
have
got
to
do
more,
that
will
become
exaggerated,
and
they'll
administer
it
in
a
way
that
will
make
it
hard
to
select
juries.
that's
the
harm
i'm
worried
about.
so
i'm
asking
you,
how
would
you
sketch
a
line
that
prevents
that
harm?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
ask
you
--
i
just
asked
you
to
do
your
best.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we've
got
the
wave
of
public
passion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
about
the
second
half?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what's
the
second
half?
the
second
half,
which
i'm
really
worried
about,
is
that
we
get
into
the
business
of
running
the
trial
court's
trials.
so
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
that
the
trial
court
at
that
stage,
in
your
opinion,
other
than
transfer,
has
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
if
--
i
gather
--
that
a
--
that
a
trial
judge
has
a
panel
in
front
of
him
and
people
say,
yes,
i
think
he
is
guilty?
and
--
and
the
trial
judge
says,
now,
if
you
listen
to
the
presumption,
can
you
be
fair?
you
look
him
in
the
eye,
and
if
he
says,
yes,
i
can
put
this
aside,
trial
judges
do
accept
those
jurors.
now,
if
that
is
the
practice,
and
others
would
know
more
than
me,
then
our
--
our
--
i'm
worried
about
changing
that
ordinary
practice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
problem?
i
went
through
the
200
pages,
and
i
counted
--
this
is
only
my
own
subjective
recounting
of
it,
but
i
counted
six
of
whom
only
one
lasted,
but
i
counted
five
others
that
they
had
to
use
peremptories
on
that
include
one
juror,
29,
who
herself
was
a
victim
of
this
offense
to
the
tune
of
$50,000
or
$60,000.
the
judge
said:
i
will
not
challenge
her
for
cause.
i
counted
another,
juror
--
what's
this
one
--
juror
number
--
number's
74,
who
when
he
looked
her
square
in
the
eye
and
said,
"can
you
be
fair"?
she
said,
"i
can't
say
yes
for
sure.
"
"no.
"
okay?
so,
in
my
own
subjective
account,
there
were
five
here,
maybe
six,
certainly
three,
that
perhaps
if
they'd
had
an
appeal
on
peremptories,
which
apparently
they
don't,
they
might
have
said
these
should
have
been
challenged
for
cause.
so
i'm
concerned
about
the
5
hours,
about
the
lack
of
excusal
for
cause,
about
the
very,
very
brief
questions
that
he
provided
to
people
who
had
said
on
the
questionnaire
they
could
be
--
they
could
be
biased.
they
said
we
think
he's
guilty,
for
example.
and
all
those
are
cause
for
concern.
at
the
same
time,
i'm
worried
about
controlling
too
much
a
trial
judge.
i've
expressed
those
concerns.
i
know
this
is
a
special
case.
half,
almost,
of
the
jury
questionnaires
they
just
threw
out.
and
the
community
--
you
know
all
the
arguments
there.
you
see
what's
worrying
me.
and
i'm
worried
about
a
fair
trial
in
this
instance
and
to
say
--
and
i'm
genuinely
worried,
and
--
and
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response
to
the
kind
of
thing
i'm
bringing
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
never
heard
of
an
instance
where
a
trial
judge
would
not
challenge
for
cause
--
but
i'm
not
saying
it
doesn't
happen
--
where
the
juror
herself
is
a
victim
of
the
offense
to
the
tune
of
$50,000
to
$60,000.
see,
we
are
getting
into
an
area
that
i'm
not
familiar
with,
but
i
think
that
that's
not
supposed
to
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
it's
not
just
one.
there
were
like
five,
of
which
i
have
given
you
the
worst,
and
they
had
to
use
up
all
their
peremptories.
and
they
can't
appeal
this.
and
it's
that
taken
together,
plus
the
one
who
sat,
juror
11,
provides,
as
they
point
out
for
the
reasons
they
say,
some
cause
for
concern.
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
ahead
with
it,
but
they
didn't
challenge
63
for
cause,
so
i
guess
they
waived
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
try
juror
number
--
let's
try
76:
judge:
"here's
the
detail
that
really
concerns
me.
"
"you
said,
'i
think
they're
all
guilty.
"
"'.
"
"right".
"now,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
thinking
that,
if
that's
what
you
really
think.
"
"you
just
need
to
tell
us
that.
"
"okay".
"that's
what
you
think,
isn't
it?
"
"it's
been
a
long
time
since
i
answered
that
questionnaire.
"
"right.
"
"now,
as
you--
"
okay?
now,
that's
--
that,
as
far
as
i
could
tell,
is
as
close
as
i
can
get
to
a
recantation
of
what
she
thought
originally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
--
well,
you
focus
on
what
you
just
put
together.
you
said
intent
to
deceive,
intent
to
violate
the
law.
i
believe
in
another
case,
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
have
an
intent
to
violate
the
law
because
there
was
no
state
law
that
prohibited
whatever
was
at
issue.
so
is
the
government
now
saying
--
which
is
a
big
difference
--
that
you
cannot
convict
somebody
unless
they
know,
i.e.,
they
intend
to
violate
a
law
that
forbids
the
conduct
in
which
they
are
engaging,
other
than
this
honest
services
law,
or
are
you
not
saying
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
saying
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
if
you're
not
saying
that,
what
the
person
has
to
carry
around
with
them
is
an
agency
treatise.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
mean,
of
course
they
intend
to
--
it's
not
the
case
that
is
obvious;
it's
the
case
that
is
not
obvious
that
worries
me,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
case
that
is
not
obvious,
of
course
they
intend
to
withhold
information.
i
agree
with
that.
but
the
problem
is
they
don't
know
it's
unlawful
to
do
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
on
932,
she
does
answer
it,
and
says,
"he's
assumed
innocent".
"and
can
you
conscientiously
carry
out
that
assumption?
"
"i
could
honestly
say
i
will
give
it
my
best.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
the
judge
looks
her
in
the
eye
and
says
--
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
and
i'll--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'll
read
that
again.
but
my
question
is,
can
we
get
a
hold
of
these
238
questionnaires?
are
they
in
the
record
in
front
of
us?
