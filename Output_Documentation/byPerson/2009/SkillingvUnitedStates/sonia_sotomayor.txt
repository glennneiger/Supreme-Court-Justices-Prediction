justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
we
take
from
trial
counsel
at
the
end
of
the
voir
dire
process
announcing
that
if
he
had
had
extra
preemptory
challenges,
he
would
have
used
them
only
against
6
of
the
12
people
that
were
finally
selected?
if
that's
all
he
would
have
ejected,
why
couldn't
a
fair
jury
have
been
found?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
different
--
that's
a
different
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
taking
a
broader
proposition
and
saying
that
the
presumption
could
not
under
any
set
of
circumstances
be
overcome,
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
probe.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
there
was
only
one
juror
that
had
been
challenged
for
cause
against
--
for
which
a
preemptory
challenge
wasn't
used.
i
thought
that
every
other
for-cause
challenge
ended
up
being
excused
on
the
basis
of
a
preemptory
challenge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
means
that
there
were
six
that
were
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
what
in
the
process
itself,
outside
of
your
general
proposition
that
no
process
could
find
fair
jurors?
what
else
in
the
process
was
deficient?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
see,
the
problem
with--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no.
finish
justice
breyer--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
i
look
at--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
there
any
place
in
the
record
i
could
look
to
see
questions
that
you
would
have
posed
absent
the
judge's
limitations?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
repeat
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
of
any
other
high-profile
case
comparable
to
this
in
which
the
voir
dire
lasted
only
5
hours?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
aware
of
any
that's
been
reported
where
the
selection
was
5
hours
only?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
--
but
is
it
occasional
or
accidental?
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer
is
getting
at.
with
such
a
truncated
voir
dire
and
one
in
which
the
judge
basically
said
to
the
lawyers,
i'm
not
giving
you
much
leeway
at
all,
how
can
we
be
satisfied
that
there
was
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
picked
when
the
judge
doesn't
follow
up
on
a
witness
who
says,
i'm
a
victim
of
this
fraud?
i
don't
know
--
i
would
find
it
strange
that
we
would
permit
jurors
who
are
victims
of
the
crime
to
serve
as
jurors.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
--
but
the
judge
didn't
strike
her
for
cause.
so
isn't
that
symptomatic
of
not
following
through
adequately?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
--
the
following
hypothetical:
i'm
a
councilperson
in
a
jurisdiction
that's
considering
a
tax
increase
or
a
tax
break,
and
i
vote
for
the
tax
break,
and
i
happen
to
have
property
that
qualifies.
is
that
a
breach
of
the
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
please
tell
me
what
i
look
to,
to
discern
--
if
i'm
a
councilperson,
to
discern
what
needs
to
be
disclosed
or
not
disclosed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
could--
