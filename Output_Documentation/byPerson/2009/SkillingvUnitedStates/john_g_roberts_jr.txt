chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
today
in
case
08-1394,
skilling
v.
united
states.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
you
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they're
going
to
lie,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
you
think
they're
going
to
lie?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
they
fill
out
the
form
and
say
this
is
what
i've
heard,
and
this
--
i
can
fairly
evaluate
the
law
and
the
arguments?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
can
i
--
perhaps
it's
time
for
you
to
shift
gears,
if
i
could--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
move
to
the
statutory
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
it's
difficult.
the
statute
prohibits
"scheme
to
deprive
another
of
the
intangible
right
of
honest
services.
"
skilling
owed
the
enron
shareholders
honest
services.
he
acted
dishonestly
in
a
way
that
harmed
them.
but
i
don't
understand
the
difficulty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
there
has
to
be
--
there
has
to
be
a
right
to
honesty.
in
other
words,
it's
not
just
in
the
abstract.
and
the
shareholders
had
a
right
to
his
honest
services.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
a
disclosed
interest?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
you've
just
explained
is
why
you
think
the
statute
is
very
broad.
you
haven't
explained
why
it's
vague.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
took
many
days
after
it
had
been
transferred.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
very
--
the
atmosphere
in
oklahoma
city
was
very
different
from
that
anywhere
else,
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
the
bombing
on
that
particular
community.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no.
no.
they'd
go
to
the
statute
that
says
honest
services--
[laughter]
right.
it
seems
--
it
seems
--
i'm
being
flip.
it
seems
that
that's
where
you
would
focus
your
attention,
if
you
think
your
community
has
essentially
been
fleeced
by
somebody
because
of
his
dishonesty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
--
if
you're
going
to
say
that
the
statute
refers
to
a
term
of
art,
the
whole
point
of
a
term
of
art
is
that
it's
a
shorthand
for
defining
something.
and
then
--
but
if
you're
saying
that
it's
a
term
of
art
that
means
the
pre-mcnally
case
law
over
the
--
you
know,
all
the
different
circuits
and
the
district
courts
and
that
some
knowledge
of
that,
it
--
it's
descriptive
of
something,
but
it's
not
a
term
of
art.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
with
you
there.
but
then
the
kinds
of
cases
--
that's
where
it
gets
fuzzy.
i
mean,
you
need
lawyers
and
research
before
you
get
an
idea
of
what
the
pre-mcnally
state
of
law
was
with
respect
to
intangible
--
the
right
to
intangible
services,
of
honest
services.
and
i'm
just
wondering
how
clear
does
what
that
body
of
law
is
have
to
be
before
you
can
say,
you
know
what,
when
we
tell
you
that
right,
you
know
that
that's
what
it's
referring
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
kind
of
--
it
puts
the
prospective
defendant,
i
guess,
in
an
awfully
difficult
position,
though,
if
he
has
got
to
wait.
there's
this
common
law
evolution
over
time.
you
have
two
cases
the
government
wins,
one
it
loses,
three
--
and
he's
supposed
to
keep
track
of
that.
that
doesn't
sound
like
fair
notice
of
what's
criminal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
covers
the
case
that
your
friend
put
of
the
employee
using
the
computer
for
personal
use?
that
fits
under
this
instruction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
srinivasan,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
--
it's
a
different
model
of
it.
as
mr.
dreeben
was
explaining,
if
you
have
an
experienced
judge
who
goes
through
this
all
the
time,
i
think
it's
reasonable
for
him
to
say:
look,
bring
the
person
in
front
of
me.
we've
got
a
questionnaire.
i
can
identify
the
problems,
look
him
in
the
eye,
and
i've
got
a
lot
of
experience
picking
a
jury,
and
it's
better
to
let
me
do
it
than
to
have
the
lawyers
have
3
weeks
to
do
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
in
--
opinions
in
three
related
cases
this
morning.
