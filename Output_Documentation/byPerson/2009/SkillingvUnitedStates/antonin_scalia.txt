justice
antonin
scalia
what
49
and
50?
of
the
government's
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
you
have
a
statute
that
--
that
makes
it
criminal
to
--
to
do
any
bad
thing,
okay?
now
it's
clear
that
murder
would
be
covered.
all
right?
nobody
would
say
that
murder
is
not
covered
by
that.
does
--
does
that
make
the
statute
non-vague?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
just
because
you
can
pick
something
that
everybody
would
agree
comes
within
a
denial
of
honest
services,
doesn't
--
doesn't
mean
that
when
you
say
nothing
but
honest
services,
you're
saying
something
that
--
that
has
sufficient
content
to
--
to
support
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
were
cases
that
--
that
--
some
of
which
included
bribery,
but
others
of
which
included
a
variety
of
--
of
other
actions,
some
of
which
were
allowed
by
some
courts
and
some
of
which
were
disallowed
by
some
courts.
there
was
no
solid
content
to
what
mcnally
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
circular,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
the
duty
of
an
employee
to
provide
honest
services
to
his
employer
--
that's
not
included
because
the
employee
is
not
a
fiduciary?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you
get
the
fiduciary
limitation?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
it
says
is
"honest
services".
i
would
think
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
employee
has
the
obligation
to
provide
honest
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
give
me
a
whole
lot
of
comfort,
i
mean,
just
because
there's
an
intent
to
deceive.
an
intent
to
deceive
can
be
the
basis
for
--
for
terminating
a
contract.
there's
--
there's
been
fraud
in
the
inducement
or
something
of
that
sort.
so
i
know
i'm
liable
to
have
the
contract
terminated,
and
maybe
for
damages
for
the
contract.
and
you
say:
and
also,
by
the
way,
you
know,
you
can
go
to
jail
for
a
number
of
years,
because,
oh,
yes,
it's
very
vague,
but
you
intended
to
deceive,
and
that's
all
--
that's
all
you
need
to
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
either
this
was
too
little
or
martha
stewart
was
too
much?
