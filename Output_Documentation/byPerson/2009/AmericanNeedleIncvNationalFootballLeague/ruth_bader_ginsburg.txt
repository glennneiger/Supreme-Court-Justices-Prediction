did
that
cover
everything
that
the
nfla
does?
because
everything
is
subject
to
agreement,
it's
all
concerted
action,
so
is
everything
under
the
sherman
act,
and
then
it
goes
to
rule
of
reason
analysis?
or
are
there
some
things
that
escape,
entirely,
antitrust
analysis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
nager,
i
think
you
answered
my
question
originally:
yes,
everything.
because
they
are
separate
entities,
they
agree
on
everything.
there
is
agreement
in
every
case,
so
there
was
nothing
you
would
take
outside,
and
you
would
put
everything
under
the
rule
of
reason
analysis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
--
one
concern
in
the
litigation
is,
you
know,
if
it
doesn't
come
under
the
sherman
act
at
all,
they
go
home
after
the
case
is
dismissed
on
the
--
on
the
pleadings.
but
once
you
say
no,
it's
got
to
be
a
rule
of
reason
analysis,
then
you
have
discovery,
which
can
be
costly.
and
i
thought
that
that
was
a
feature
of
this
case,
that
the
--
that
the
plaintiff
wanted
more
discovery,
and
the
court
said:
you've
had
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
point
that
your
client
wasn't
hurt
until
they
dealt
exclusively
with
one
manufacturer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
have
nothing
--
you
had
no
damages
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
--
may
i
ask
you
to
go
back
just
one
step?
because
you
seem
to
treat
this
as
though
the
nflp
was
formed
in
1963
and
that
was
the
end
of
it,
but
another
description
is:
well,
it
was
formed,
but
then
there
were
some
teams
that
were
not
in
it
until
later,
and
there
were
some
other
parts;
that
it
has
expanded.
what
it
does
has
expanded
since
1963.
so
it
wasn't
one
point
in
time
where
there
was
formation,
and
then
if
you
didn't
--
if
you
are
not
challenging
that,
everything
else
is
okay.
