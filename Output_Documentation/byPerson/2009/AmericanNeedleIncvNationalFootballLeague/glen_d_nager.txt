mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
an
agreement
of
the
32
teams
of
the
national
football
league
was
immune
from
any
scrutiny
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
on
the
ground
that
the
agreement
allegedly
fails
the
plurality
of
actor
requirement
of
this
court's
jurisprudence.
the
32
teams
of
the
national
football
league
are
separately
owned
and
controlled
profit-making
enterprises.
under
this
court's
decision
in
ncaa,
as
well
as
the
court's
more
general
joint
venture
jurisprudence,
those
clubs
are
entities
whose
distinct
agreements
are,
indeed,
subject
to
section
1
scrutiny.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
is
a
longstanding
consensus,
judicial
and
legislative,
that
agreements
among
sports
teams
about
whether
and
how
they
will
participate
in
the
marketplace
is
subject
to
scrutiny
under
the
sherman
act,
section
1.
the
court's
decision
in
ncaa
is
most
directly
on
point.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
a
policy
of
the
ncaa
that
restricted
the
ability
of
member
institutions
of
the
ncaa
to
sell
tv
rights
violated
section
1.
just
as
with
the
nfl,
the
decisions
of
the
ncaa
were
ultimately
controlled
by
the
vote
of
its
members,
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
held
that
the
ncaa
policy
was
a
horizontal
restraint.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so,
because
what
we
are
asking
about
here
is
--
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
agreement
of
the
teams
involves
a
plurality
of
actors.
and
just
as
in
ncaa,
the
members'
institutions
--
because
they
control
the
operation
of
the
ncaa
and
the
policy
that
it
was
promulgating,
there
was
a
plurality
of
actors.
so,
too,
here,
the
32
teams
of
the
national
football
league
have
entered
into
an
agreement
and
control
the
use,
collectively,
of
the
trademarks
and
logos
of
the
individual
teams.
and
for
that
reason,
there
is
concerted
activity
that
is
involved.
justice
sotomayor,
the
point
that
you
raise
might
be
of
--
a
point
of
difference
that
the
nfl
could
argue
in
the
context
of
an
ancillary
restraint
analysis
and
the
context
of
a
rule
of
reason
analysis,
but
it
is
not
a
point
of
distinction
that
they
can
argue
properly
in
the
context
of
the
concerted
conduct
inquiry.
the
ncaa
case
simply
applies
the
consistent
teachings
of
this
court
in
cases
like
sealy,
bmi,
and
copperweld,
that
separately
owned
and
controlled
entities
entering
into
agreements,
those
agreements
constitute
concerted
conduct
subject
to
scrutiny
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
certainly
everything
in
the
--
that
is
challenged
in
this
case,
because
this
involves
a
restriction
on
the
activities
of
the
venturers
themselves.
but
more
generally,
i
would
--
i
would
answer
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
to
say
that
yes,
that
everything
that
these
32
separately
owned
and
controlled
teams
joined
together
to
do
by
--
in
concert,
by
agreement,
by
consent,
is
a
contract.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
it
is
concerted
activity.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
plausible
rule
of
reason
claim.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
think
we
know
the
following,
justice
kennedy:
that
under
this
court's
rule
of
reason's
jurisprudence,
a
plaintiff
has
to
be
able
to
plead
an
identifiable
anticompetitive
effect
in
a
market
in
which
the
defendant
plausibly
has
market
power,
and
the
--
the
plaintiff
also
has
to
be
one
who
can--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
answer
your
question
in
two
parts.
first
of
all,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
looking
for
a
zone,
the
concerted
conduct
doctrine
is
the
wrong
place
to
do
it,
because
remember,
if
something
is
deemed
not
to
be
concerted
conduct,
it
is
a
per
--
then
it's
per
se,
not
subject
to
section
1
and
per
se
legal.
and
i
think
for
the
court's
jurisprudence
over
the
last
30
years,
the
court
has
been
trying
to
get
out
of
per
se
rules
and
have
a
more
focused
inquiry
into
what
the
anticompetitive
effects
and
procompetitive
effects
of
a
particular
restraint
are.
the
concerted
conduct
doctrine
would
be
a
very
blunt
tool
to
use
for
that
purpose.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
--
and
i
appreciate
your
question
--
in
the
ncaa
case
itself,
where
conditions
of
competition
and
the
like
were
raised,
justice
stevens'
opinion
for
the
court
says
that
in
contrast
to
the
tv
restraint,
these
other
types
of
rules
and
regulations
of
the
sports
league
are
presumptively
competitive,
procompetitive,
presumptively
favorable
to
consumers,
because
they
are
integral
and
bound
up
with
the
creation
of
the
football
venture
itself.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
justice
alito,
if
i
--
i
may
not
have
gotten
all
of
your
question,
but
let
me
answer
it
in
two
parts.
the
antitrust
laws
do
not
require
joint
ventures
to
maximize
output.
they
don't
require
joint
ventures
to
maximize
competition.
they
simply
prohibit
people
entering
into
contracts
from
unreasonably
restraining
trade.
so
a
mere
agreement
among
the
team
owners
that
they
would
have
a
14-game
schedule
rather
than
a
16-game
schedule
is
not
a
prima
facie
showing
of
an
anticompetitive
impact,
because
all
it's
showing
us
is
what
the
joint
venturers
have
done
with
their
own
output.
they
have
--
you
haven't
alleged
a
market-wide
reduction
in
output.
now,
if
by
your
question
you
were
saying
in
addition--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--what
i
--
what
i
was
going
to
jump
right
to
is:
if
in
addition
to
changing
the
league
schedule,
the
team
owners
in
concert
agreed
to
prohibit
the
teams
of
the
national
football
league
from
--
from
playing
any
other
games
--
doing
an
exhibition
game
in
japan,
the
redskins
and
the
giants
playing
another
game
--
that
might
show
a
market-wide
reduction
in
output.
and
the
court's
decision
in
ncaa
says
very
specifically
that
the
most
important
condition
of
ensuring
the
competitiveness
of
joint
ventures
is
ensuring
the
freedom
of
the
individual
venturers
to
produce
output,
increase
output.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
a
league
rule
of
that
type
would
be
unlawful.
all
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
if
in
addition
to
changing
the
schedule
of
games
for
the
league,
they
also
imposed
a
restriction
on
the
individual
venturers
from
producing
additional
games
on
their
own,
we
might
have
something
that
looked
more
like
a
plausible
rule
of
restraint--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--what
i'm
saying
is,
first
of
all,
it
would
plainly
be
concerted
activity
on
the
part
of
the
team
owners
because
they
would
have
entered
into
a
horizontal
restraint
on
the
activity
of
the
venturers.
whether
or
not
that
horizontal
restraint
violated
the
antitrust
laws,
one
would
have
to
go
through
the
following
analysis,
justice
sotomayor:
first,
we
would
ask
whether
that
restriction
is
an
ancillary
--
was
an
ancillary
restraint.
and
an
ancillary
restraint,
starting
with
judge
taft,
later
chief
justice
taft's,
opinion
in
the
addison
pipe
case,
is:
is
that
restraint
reasonably
necessary
to
achieve
the
efficiency-enhancing
purposes
of
the
joint
venture
and
is
it
no
broader
than
necessary?
and
if
it
is,
then
we
would
analyze
that
restraint
by
reference
to
its
own
procompetitive
benefits
and
anticompetitive
effects;
we
would
analyze
it
by
reference
to
the
benefits
of
the
joint
venture
as
a
whole.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
exactly
right,
and
the
real--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
let
me
try
to
address
justice
sotomayor's
subsequent
question
in
the
context
of
the
way
you
are
posing
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
reason
it's
a
horizontal
restraint
is
because
these
--
under
the
court's
doctrine,
consistent
teachings,
whether
it
be
sealy,
bmi,
copperweld,
these
teams
are
separately
owned.
they
are
separate
decision-makers
joining
together,
and
they
are
making
a
decision
about
how
they
are
going
to
jointly
produce
something
or
not
produce
something.
and
that's
what
makes
it
concerted
activity
under
this
court's
consistent
teachings.
the
distinction
between
unilateral
activity
under
section
1
and
concerted
activity
under
section
1
has
consistently
been
the
distinction
between
ownership
integration
of
assets
and
contract
integration
of
assets.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
--
absolutely,
as
the
plaintiff
in
the
case,
justice
stevens,
that
--
we
do.
that
is
not
the
ground
of
decision
on
the
court
below.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
absolutely.
and
i'm
not--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--in
the
--
i'm
sorry,
justice?
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
--
i
don't
have
to
argue
--
i
mean,
i
don't
think
i
have
to
argue
in
this
court.
i
just
have
to
answer
your
questions,
but--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
correct.
and
in
fact,
in
this
case,
justice
stevens,
i
would
point
out
that
the
nfl
initially
moved
to
dismiss
the
--
the
rule
of
reason
count
on
the
ground
that
it
didn't
state
a
cognizable,
plausible
rule
of
reason,
and
the
district
court
judge
denied
that
motion.
he
found
the
complaint
alleged
a
market
in
which
he
could
not
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
nfl
defendants
did
not
have
market
power,
and
he
recognized
that
the
--
that
the
teams
had
agreed
together
to
prohibit
competition
in
an
aspect
of
their
licensing
activity
and
in
an
aspect
of
their
merchandising
activity.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens,
i'm
not
quite
sure.
but
you
are
saying
if
in
the
response
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
he
had
--
he
had
held--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
let
me
explain
what
they've
done,
and
i
will
then
explain
why
it
does
have
a
--
identifiable
anticompetitive
effects,
which
certainly
satisfy
the
pleading
standards
for
a
rule
of
reason
claim.
what
the
teams
did
here
was
they
got
together
and
they
agreed
that
they
would
not,
themselves,
individually
license
their
trademarks
or
logos.
they
agreed
that
they
--
under
--
the
current
market
system
included
the
issuance
of
market
blanket
licenses.
they
would
eliminate
all
but
one
of
those
blanket
licenses
from
the
market
and
they
would
give
it
in
the
exclusive
control
of
reebok,
and
they
would
limit
the
circumstances
in
which
they
competed
against
each
other
and
with
reebok,
and
said--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
per
se
violation
was
dismissed
and--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
no.
what
i
would
say--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
what
i
would
point
you
to
is
the
statement
--
i
mean,
if--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--what
the
complaint
talks
about
is
the
granting
of
an
exclusive
license
here.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
but
the
exclusivity
as
to--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
ability
to
compete.
yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
understand
the
--
the
point.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
understand
the
point
you
are
making.
i
would
also
make
the
point
that--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--in
part.
but
you've
got
to
recognize
what
the
competition
is
for.
the
competition
is
for
fans.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
you're
right
that
someone
who
has
lived
in
new
york
city
for
a
long
time
is
unlikely
to
be
a
red
sox
fan
and
be
easily
be
persuaded
to
be
a
red
sox
fan,
but
the
person
who
is
three
years
old
can
easily
be
persuaded.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
but
the
other
point
i
would
make
is--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
just
showing
that
each
team
has
substantial
market
power.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
again,
they--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--not
quite.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
you're
--
that
is
the
only
issue,
justice
scalia.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
because
counsel
has
an
obligation
to
respond
to
questions.
[laughter]
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
appreciate
your
honor--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--you'd
be
a
good
blocker.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
we're
not--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
answer
to--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
the
guidance
i
would
give
you,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
as
justice
scalia
says,
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
these
agreements
constitute
concerted
activity.
they
plainly
do,
because
they
are
agreements
between
separately
owned
and
controlled
competing
businesses.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
--
that
is
correct.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
rule
of
reason
is
some
unstructured,
indeterminate--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
no.
the
--
the
judge
only
allowed
discovery
on
the
single
entity
issue.
he
did
not
allow
discovery
on
--
on
the
rule
of
reason
question.
so
there's
been
--
not
been
--
discovery
on
the
substance
of
the
case
has
not
been
conducted.
so
in
that
regard,
the
question
of
how
the
case
would
be
managed
going
forward
is
something
that
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
district
court
on
remand
from
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
after
this
erroneous
conclusion
that
the
agreements
don't
constitute
concerted
conduct
is
put
to
the
test.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
correct
insofar
as
it
criticizes
the
seventh
circuit's
reasoning.
the
test
that
the
solicitor
general
proposes
is
conceptually
and
doctrinally
unsound,
and
it
will
create
a
lack
of
clarity
where
there
presently
exists
clarity
in
the
cases,
and
it
will
produce
inefficiency
and
waste
in
the
conduct
of
litigation
that
does
not
presently
exist.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
understand
your
point,
mr.
chief
justice:
that
to
the
extent
that
rule
of
reason
inquiries
are
not
as
refined
as
they
need
to
be,
since
the
solicitor
general's
concerted
conduct
inquiry
includes
rule
of
reason
inquiries
--
indeed,
on
its
effective
merger
standard,
it
says
it
has
to
survive
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
or
somehow
be
waived,
or
you
would
have
to
do
it
as
part
of
the
concerted
conduct
inquiry
--
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
to
the
extent
that
--
that
the
rule
of
reason
is
a
continuing
project
of
this
court,
we
would
be
transferring
some
of
that
project
into
the
concerted
conduct
inquiry.
with
all
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
healthy
development
in
the
law.
the
courts
actually
understand
the
concerted
conduct
doctrine
as
it
presently
exists.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i
think
the
answer
is,
you
should
--
you
should
use
english
language
and
doctrine
to
address
the
issue
that
you
are
actually
trying
to
address,
rather
than
call
it
something
else.
right
now
we
have
an
antitrust
doctrine
that
says
you've
got
to
have
concerted
conduct
and
you
have
to
have
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
we
have
courts
that
understand
how
to
apply
this
court's
cases
on
concerted
conduct.
this
court
is
--
for
understandable
reasons,
is
sensitive
to
the
fact
that
the
rule
of
reason
is
not
quite
as
well
understood
and
is
an
evolutionary
doctrine,
perfectly
well
understood
by
me.
there
are
certain
issues
that
this
court
has
said
come
up
in
a
rule
of
reason
analysis,
and
to
quote
the
court
from
cal
dental,
"can
be
dealt
with
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye.
"
that
is,
some
claims,
as
the
ncaa
court
said,
are
not
going
to
be
serious
rule
of
reason
claims
and
can
be
dismissed
on
the
pleadings.
the
court
said
that
in
twombly
as
well.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
in
terms
of
what
this
court
--
obviously,
on
my
client's
behalf,
i
have
to
vigorously
state
to
the
court
we
think
we
have
a
bona
fide,
serious
rule
of
reason
claim
--
but
yes,
justice
stevens--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
i
--
i
didn't
handle
the
case
below,
so
i
don't
quite
know
how
it
got
into
the
record.
it
is
my
--
certainly
my
understanding
that
there
is
an
affidavit
in
the
record
that
says
that
the
revenues
that
the
nflp
entity
receives
are
distributed
to
the
teams
in
equal
shares,
so
that
that--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
--
i
think
not.
you
have
to
remember
that
that
agreement
to
not
compete
and
have
only
one
entity--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that
is
the
very
thing
the
case
challenges.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
our
market
was
alleged
and
held
not
to
be
legally
invalid
by
the
district
court,
to
be
nfl-logoed
hats
and
apparel.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
that
--
that's
correct.
and
the
district
court
judge
held
that
that
was
a
--
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
ncaa
and
the
international
boxing
case
--
was
a
plausible
market
to
allege
in
which
the
nfl
teams
had
market
power.
and
so
it
would
be
a
question
for
the
district
court
managing
the
case
going
forward
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
was
a
factually
supportable
market.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
the
--
the
answer
is--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
understood
--
that
the
american
needle
said
in
the
court
below
that
what
it
was
challenging
was
the
grant
of
an
exclusive
license
to
nflp
that
prohibited
the
individual
team
competition
and
it
limited
all
competition
in
the
market
in
blanket
licenses.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
on
page
2
of
the
orange
brief,
the
nfl
said
they
understood
exactly
what
our
case
was
--
this
is
on
page
2,
the
second
sentence:
"american
needle
alleged
that
the
decades-old
agreement
among
the
member
clubs
to
collectively
market
such
intellectual
property
was
unlawful
under
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act,
at
least
after
the
2001
decision
to
collectively
license
the
marks
to
a
single
headwear
manufacturer.
"
the
nfl
stood
--
understood
exactly
what
we
were
arguing,
and
they
have
understood
it
throughout
this
case,
as
did
the
lower
courts.
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
understand
it.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
before.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
just
like
to
pick
up
on
a
question
that
chief
justice
roberts
asked
me
with
a
point
that
justice
breyer
made,
which
is
that
both
the
solicitor
general's
position
and
the
nfl's
position
are
taking
rule
of
reason
concepts
and
trying
to
push
them
into
the
concerted
conduct
inquiry,
which
will
have
the
effect,
of
course,
of
confusing
courts
that
presently
understand
the
inquiry.
that's
justice
breyer's
point
about
terminology.
it
also
has
substantive
impact
because
of
the
way
litigation
gets
conducted.
as
mr.
levy
has
said,
this
case
was
litigated
below
at
of
the
district
court
judge's
direction
only
on
the
concerted
conduct
question,
not
on
the
--
the
rule
of
reason
questions.
so,
american
needle
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
conduct
discovery
and
make
proof
about
anticompetitive
effects
and
to
try
to
rebut
the
arguments
that
the
nfl
was
making
about
procompetitive
justifications.
the
nfl's
argument
is
asking
--
they
are
asking
for
a
per
se
rule
of
legality
for
everything
that
the
nfl
does
that
is
related
to
football.
that
can't
be--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--on
the
--
the
partnership
example.
well,
the
partnership
is
--
is
as
follows:
as
--
as
to
the
extent
that
there
is
case
law
on
the
subject,
as
with
all
joint
ventures,
the
case
law
treats
law
firm
partnerships
as
joint
ventures
and
subjects
them
to
the
rule
of
reason,
and
every
commentator
whether
it
be
judge
bork
or
anyone
else,
has
said,
but,
of
course,
law
firms
don't
have
market
power
so
they
couldn't
possibly
have
anticompetitive
effects
on
the
market,
and
the
rule
of
reason
claim
trying
to
challenge
the
rates
at
which
a
law
firm
sets
its
partnership
rates
wouldn't
pass
--
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss.
with
respect
to
his
analogy
to
dagher,
the
difference
between
the
dagher
effects
--
of
course
this
court
didn't
in
dagher
didn't
accept
the
argument
that
i
made
on
behalf
of
texaco
and
shell
that
they
should
be
treated
as
a
single
entity
if,
in
fact,
their
formation
was
lawful.
this
court
only
ruled
on
the
--
on
the
price
fixing
issue.
but
the
argument
that
was
made
in
dagher
was
if
you
had
a
wholly
integrated
joint
venture,
one
in
which
there
had
been
a
complete
pooling
of
relevant
capital,
a
complete
sharing
of
profits
and
losses
and
an
enforceable
non-compete
agreement,
in
those
circumstances
the
--
the
owners
of
that
joint
venture
were
not
like
typical
joint
venturers,
they,
in
fact,
were
like
the
share
holders
in
a
publicly
held
company,
because
their
only
interest
at
that
point
is
in
their
investment.
they
have
no
other
economic
interests
that
are
affected
by
their
ownership
and
control
of
that
entity.
and
at
that
point
they
could
be
treated
as
one.
in
justice
thomas's
opinion
for
the
court
has
some
residence
of
that
in
it,
but
it
specifically
says
it
is
only
addressing
it
in
terms
of
the
per
se
rule.
