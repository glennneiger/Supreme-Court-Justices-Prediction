mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
by
focusing
on
a
rather
mundane
aspect
of
the
nfl
commissioner's
powers,
this
may
help
to
explain
why
the
united
states
is
not
four-square
in
support
of
either
party's
theory
in
this
case.
among
the
powers
that
is
vested
in
the
commissioner
by
the
nfl
--
by
the
nfl
constitution
is
the
power
to
incur
expenses
to
carry
on
the
ordinary
business
of
the
league,
and
this
includes
renting
office
space,
hiring
employees,
and
procuring
supplies.
and
if
the
commissioner,
pursuant
to
that
delegation
of
authority,
decides
from
which
company
he's
going
to
--
to
acquire
paper
for
the
league's
offices
or
decides
what
the
weight
scale
for
secretaries
in
the
league
offices
should
be,
our
view
is
that
that's
the
conduct
of
a
single
entity.
it
may
be
that
the
commissioner's
power
to
do
those
things
is
ultimately
derived
from
the
consent
of
the
individual
teams
within
the
league,
but
once
that
consent
has
been
given,
once
that
authority
has
been
centralized,
then
the
commissioner's
decision
about
a
paper
supplier
or
wages
for
employees--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
we
would
say
two
things.
the
first
is,
up
until
now
there
has
been
no
such
thing
in
the
law
as
concerted
action
that
is
per
se
legal,
or
per
se
reasonable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
my
point
is
that
if,
for
instance,
a
disappointed
bidder
for
the
paper
supply
conduct
--
contract
challenged
this
as
a
section
1
violation
and
said
the
commissioner's
decision
to
go
to
staples
rather
than
office
depot
was
unreasonable
because
office
depot
was
offering
a
better
product
at
a
lower
price
--
there
are
certainly
decisions
that
the
commissioner
could
make
with
respect
to
procurement
of
supplies
or
the
setting
of
wage
levels
that
would
be
unreasonable
in
a
business
judgment
sense,
in
that
they
wouldn't
effectively
carry
on
the
mission
of
the
organization,
but
they
wouldn't
be
unreasonable
in
the
--
the
section
1
sense.
and
the
other
thing
i
would
say
is
that
line
of
argument
could
have
been
made
in
copperweld;
that
is,
the
court
could
have
concluded
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well
--
well,
in
dagher,
for
instance,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
situation
that's
in
some
ways
analogous
to
the
one
that
you
have
here;
that
is,
a
joint
venture
in
which
entities
that
were
economic
competitors
in
some
aspects
of
their
businesses
joined
forces
with
respect
to
other
aspects.
and
the
court
in
dagher
didn't
squarely
resolve
these
questions,
whether
section
1
applied,
but
it
said
that
in
pricing
its
products,
equilon,
the
joint
venture,
was
acting
as
a
single
firm,
a
single
entity.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
about
my
--
my
paper
and
employee
example
is
that,
in
our
view,
the
nfl
commissioner,
when
carrying
out
those
functions
on
behalf
of
the
league,
would
be
acting
as
a
single
entity,
even
though
his
power
was
derived
from
the
consent
of
the
teams.
but
if
the
jets
and
the
giants
agreed
among
themselves
as
to
what
wages
they
would
pay
their
secretaries
or
from
whom
they
would
buy
paper,
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
thing.
the
fact
that
those
teams
are
for
some
purposes
part
of
a--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
section
--
the
question
of
whether
section
1
applied
would
not
be
any
different;
that
is,
the
central
section
1--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
--
it
may
not
be
a
red
herring
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
resolution
of
the
case;
that
is,
if
the
court
on
--
the
lower
court,
on
remand,
if
the
case
were
remanded,
applied
rule
of
reason
analysis,
the
--
the
precise
nature
of
the
contract
might
bear
on
whether
the
restraint
was
reasonable,
but
it
wouldn't
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
concerted
activity
was
involved;
that
is,
what--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
my
point
was,
once
--
once
the
teams
decided
that
they
would
--
rather
than
each
negotiating
individually,
either
with
a
single
licensee
or
with
multiple
licensees,
once
they
decided
they
would
negotiate
as
a
collective
and
that
any
potential
licensee
had
to
go
to
the
collective
rather
than
to
the
individual
teams,
that's
the
central
section
1
issue.
and
if
the
--
the
collective
had
decided,
we
will
give
contracts
to
a
multitude
of
potential
bidders,
that
would
not
have
affected
the
fact
that
concerted
action
was
involved.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
would
--
that
initial
delegation
of
authority
would
be
subject
to
a
section
1
challenge,
because
that
would
be
concerted
action
in
the
same
way
that
the
court
in
dagher
said--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--because
that
--
that
occurs
after
the
point
at
which
the
commissioner
has
been
vested
with
that
authority.
if
--
if
somehow
a
plaintiff
wanted
to
say
there
was
an
--
there
was
illicit
concerted
action
when
the
teams
agreed
to
give
the
commissioner
this
general
power,
that
would
be
subject
to
section
1
review.
it
seems
--
because
that
would
be
concerted
action.
it
seems
highly
unlikely
that
such
a
challenge
would
prevail.
but
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--this
only
applies
to
carrying
out
the
ordinary
business
of
the
league.
it
--
it
would
only
apply
to
the
commissioner's
running
of
--
of
the
league
office,
not
the
running
of
the
individual
teams.
and
as
i
say,
our
central
point
is
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
under
our
theory,
we
would
first
ask,
as
to
an
entity
like
this,
which
is
entity
that
is
compete
in
some
respects--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
we
would
ask
first:
is
--
is
the
commissioner
acting
as
a
single
entity
when
he
exercises
delegated
authority
in
making
a
business
judgment
about
which
supplier
to
buy
paper
or
what
the
wages
should
be?
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
the
section
1
inquiry
is
over,
then
the
case
is
no
different
from
a
challenge
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
if
you
get
--
if
a
single
business
is
deciding
whether
to
buy
paper
from
one
supplier
or
from
several,
that
wouldn't
be
subject
to
section
1
review,
because
the
decision
of
the
single
business
might
affect
the
welfare
of
the
competitors,
but
it
wouldn't
be
concerted
action.
and
our
point
is
that
when
--
i
think
the
way
in
which
our
position
differs
from
that
of
the
two
parties
is
that
on
the
one
hand,
i
think
it
is
the
logical
implication
of
petitioner's
position
that
because
the
commissioner's
authority
to
buy
supplies
for
the
league
or
hire
referees
for
the
league
is
ultimately
derived
from
the
consent
of
the
individual
teams
who
are
independently
owned.
the
logic
of
petitioner's
position
suggests
that
that
would
be
subject
to
section
1
scrutiny.
on
the
other
hand,
the
logic
of
the
nfl's
position
suggests
that
because
the
commissioner
can
set
price,
can
decide
from
whom
to
buy
paper
on
behalf
of
the
league,
the
jets
and
the
giants
could
reach
a
similar
agreement,
and
the
--
or
the
jets
and
the
giants
could
agree
on
the
prices
they
will
pay
secretaries--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
follows
logically
from
the
position
that
this
is
one
entity.
because
in
copperweld,
for
instance,
the
court
noted
that
coordination
between
different
divisions
of
a
single
company
would
not
be
subject
to
section
1
scrutiny,
and
that
implies
not
just
that
all
the
divisions
could
get
together,
but
that
any
two
could
confer
among
themselves
without
raising
section
1
concerns.
