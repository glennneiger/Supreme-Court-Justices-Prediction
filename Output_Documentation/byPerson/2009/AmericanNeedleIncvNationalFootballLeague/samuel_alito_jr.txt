well,
let
me
give
you
another
example
that
you
mention
in
your
brief.
the
nfl
teams
agree
among
themselves
regarding
scheduling:
they
will
play
16
games
a
year
and
they
will
have
a
playoff
schedule
and
they
won't
play
any
other
games.
now,
would
that
be
a
clear
case
under
the
rule
of
reason?
you
mention
and
some
of
your
amici
mention
that,
for
example,
the
english
football
leagues
operate
very
differently.
justice

a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
one
of
the
team
wants
--
one
of
the
teams
wants
to
play
additional
games--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--against
a
rival
team
where
they
will
get
more
money?
