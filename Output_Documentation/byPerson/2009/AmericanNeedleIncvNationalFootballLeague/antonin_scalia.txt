but
not
--
not
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
we
find
for
you
and
it
goes
back,
then
you
would
--
you
would
bear
that
burden.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
it
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nager,
do
i
have
to
figure
this
out
here?
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
this
issue
before
us
here?
or
is
it
just
the
issue
of
whether
the
lower
court
was
wrong
to
dismiss
your
suit
on
the
basis
that
this
is
a
unitary
operation?
i
think
that
was
the
only
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
am
i
worrying
about
this
other
stuff?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
stated
purpose
is
to
promote
the
game.
the
purpose
is
to
make
money.
i
don't
think
that
they
care
whether
the
sale
of
the
helmet
or
the
t-shirt
promotes
the
game.
they
--
they
sell
it
to
make
money
from
the
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it
promotes
the
game
if
the
money
from
the
sale
goes
to
the
whole
group,
i
suppose.
but
--
but
don't
tell
me
that
there
is
not
--
absent
this
agreement,
there
would
not
be
an
independent,
individual
incentive
for
each
of
the
teams
to
sell
as
many
of
its
own
--
of
its
own
shirts
and
helmets
as
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
that
--
that
could
--
that
issue
could
be
tried.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
suppose
that's
a
triable
issue,
as
to
whether
the
purpose
of
--
of
selling
these
things
is
to
promote
the
whole
nfl
or
to
promote
the
particular
team.
it
wants
its
own
adherents
and
wants
to
sell
its
own
product.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
--
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
trademarks
have
no
value
apart
from
the
--
from
the
game.
i
guess
you
could
say
the
same
thing
for
each
individual
franchise
of
each
of
the
32
clubs.
they
are
worthless,
if
nfl
football
disappears.
so
does
that
mean
they
--
that
they
--
they
can
agree
to
fix
the
price
at
which
their
--
their
--
their
franchises
will
be
sold,
by
concerted
agreement,
because
after
all,
they
are
worthless
apart
from
the
nfl?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
i
was
reducing
it
to
the
absurd.
