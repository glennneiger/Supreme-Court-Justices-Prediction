changes
in
the
--
in
the
rule
apply?
they
make
a
change
to
make
it
--
give
the
passer
more
protection,
but
there's
--
this
really
hurts
certain
teams,
which
mostly
run,
and
so
--
rule
of
reason?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
--
you
know
the
litigation
system.
how
do
we
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my
--
my
hypothetical:
two
or
three
teams
which
aren't
particularly
popular
in
the
league
are
hurt
by
the
rule
change.
and
notice
--
notice,
the
owners
sit
around
the
room,
they
are
liable
for
a
conspiracy.
i
mean,
this
is
serious
stuff.
triple
damages.
i
don't
--
and
my
question,
really,
was
the
same
as
justice
ginsburg.
can
you
give
us
a
zone
where
we
are
sure
a
rule
of
reason
inquiry
will
be
--
would
be
inappropriate?
we
can
take
care
of
it
on
summary
judgment.
because
if
you
don't
have
some
sort
of
section
1
carveout
for
joint
action,
then
--
then
everything
is
under
the
rule
of
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
what
we
are
doing
is
exploring
the
consequences
of
completely
discarding
the
unitary
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
--
and
the
earlier
questions,
it
seemed
to
me,
were
helpful.
the
saturday/sunday
scheduling
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
pretty
clearly
on
its
face
does
limit
competition.
you
--
you
have
one
day
instead
of
two
days.
then
justice
stevens
said:
suppose
it
makes
them
better
players
because
they
are
rested
and
so
they
can
perform
better.
i
take
it
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
question.
and
i
--
i
still
don't
get
any
answers.
i
don't
know
where
we
are
with
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
it's
a
difficult
area,
but
i
would
like
--
and
--
but
i
would
like
some
guidance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
we
have
to
ask
what
was
the
intent
at
the
beginning,
as
kind
of
an
originalism
thing?
everybody
sits
around
and
says:
let's
have
a
football
league.
and
20
years
later,
they
say:
you
know,
the
sale
of
hats
and
shirts
is
a
pretty
good
thing;
let's
get
into
that
business,
too.
that
would
--
that
would
--
that's
case
one.
case
two
is,
when
they
formed
the
league
initially,
30
years
ago,
they
said:
and
be
sure
we
will
sell
hats,
and
--
i
don't
understand
the
base
point
from
which
i
find
that
this
is
a
single
entity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
take
issue
with
my
question
that
this
is
a
relevant
inquiry?
is
it
part
of
the
original
agreement
or
isn't
it,
and
why
is
it
that
the
original
agreement
is
somehow
sacrosanct?
i
don't
understand.
