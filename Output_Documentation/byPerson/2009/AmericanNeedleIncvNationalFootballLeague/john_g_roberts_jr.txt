chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-661,
american
needle
v.
the
national
football
league.
mr.
nager.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
--
your
last
few
answers
seem
to
me
to
beg
the
question.
you
start
out
by
saying:
well,
obviously
it's
a
horizontal
agreement
among
the
teams,
and
then
you
explain
how
you
are
going
to
analyze
it.
i
thought
that
was
the
very
question
before
us:
whether
these
sorts
of
rules
and
regulations
are
horizontal
agreements
between
the
teams
or
whether
they
are
part
of
a
particular
--
a
single
entities'
articulation
of
rules.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
you
have
been
begging
the
question?
is
that
--
it's
that
part?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
could
you
articulate
for
me
as
succinctly
as
possible
the
extent
to
which
your
position
departs
from
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
thought
it
is
just
the
transfer
of
the
inefficiency
and
lack
of
clarity
from
the
--
the
first
question
to
the
rule
of
reason.
i
mean,
i'm
not
quite
sure
it
--
you
don't
have
the
same
problem.
it's
just
a
question
of
where
you
want
to
rest
the
inefficiency
and
confusion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
thought
the
purpose
of
their
submission
was
to
respond
to
some
of
the
questions
we've
seen,
like
scheduling,
like
what
the
rules
are
going
to
be
about
--
about
the
game.
there
are
some
things
that
it
just
seems
odd
to
subject
to
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
and
you
yourself
have
said:
well,
that
is
going
to
be
an
easy
case
under
the
rule
of
reason.
why
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
sort
of
carve
those
out
at
the
outset,
rather
than
at
the
end
of
the
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
--
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
under
your
--
following
of
your
paper
case,
are
you
saying
that
if
the
teams
delegated
to
the
commissioner
the
authority
to
decide
whether
we
are
going
to
enter
--
whether
the
league
is
going
to
enter
into
one
contract
on
logo
products
or
let
each
team
decide,
that
would
be
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
the
decision
to
order
paper
from
one
company
rather
than
another
subject
to
section
1
challenge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
i
mean,
if
i'm
office
depot
and
i'm
selling
paper
to
the
--
to
the
giants
--
or
does
this
only
apply
to
the
commissioner's
office?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
no,
because
they
are
not
part
of
the
broader
concerted
entity.
there's
no
separate
--
you
are
saying,
well,
just
because
all
32
teams
can
act
as
--
as
an
individual
entity,
any
group
of
those
teams
can
act
as
an
individual
entity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
levy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
a
plausibility
standard
at
the
threshold
inquiry,
there
is
a
range
of
things,
and
i
guess
your
--
your
friend
on
the
other
side
is
just
saying
selling
logos
is
closer
to
selling
houses
than
it
is
to
playing
football.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
there
is
a
factual
--
if
there
is
a
factual
dispute
about
whether
a
particular
activity
of
the
league
is
designed
to
promote
the
game
or
is
designed
simply
to
make
more
money,
than
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
goes
to
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
do
something
else,
do
something
other
than
promote
the
game.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
nager,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
the
answer
to
the
--
what's
the
answer
to
the
hypothetical
mr.
levy
ended
with,
the
law
firm?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
in
this
morning
case
08-661
american
needle
versus
the
national
football
league.
