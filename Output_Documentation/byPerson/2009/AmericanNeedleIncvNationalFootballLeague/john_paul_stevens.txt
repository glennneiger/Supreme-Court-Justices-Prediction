justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
with
this
question?
is
it
not
part
of
your
burden
not
only
to
argue
there
are
multiple
actors,
but
also
that
their
agreement
has
an
adverse
effect
on
competition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it
isn't,
but
it
is
part
of
your
burden
to
say
this
is
not
a
procompetitive
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
he
--
what
if
he
further
concluded
that
the
agreement
had
the
overall
effect
of
stimulating
additional
--
it
was
procompetitive
in
that
it
would
equalize
the
economic
strength
of
the
teams,
and
therefore
made
them
all
better
competitors
on
the
playing
field?
would
that
have
been
a
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
he
said:
sure,
there
is
an
agreement
here,
but
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
the
agreement
has
an
adverse
effect
on
competition.
and
that
the
--
as
i
understand
the
facts,
you've
--
there
is
revenue
sharing
here,
isn't
there?
that
they
--
they
all
share
in
the
product
of
the
sales
of
the
joint
product?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
i
understand
your
position,
that
could
be
the
result
in
this
case.
we
don't
know
whether
the
district
court
was
right
or
wrong
in
what
he
did
on
the
--
on
the
rule
of
reason
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one
thing
i
wondered
about
the
record:
there
is
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
the
fact
that
the
teams
share
the
revenues
from
these
--
these
sales.
is
that
--
how
did
that
get
in
the
record,
the
revenue
sharing
aspect
of
their
--
of
the
different
teams'
participation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
--
wouldn't
that
--
that
affidavit
support
the
conclusion
that
this
is
basically
a
procompetitive
agreement
because
it
tends
to
make
competition
stronger
on
the
playing
field,
and
therefore,
that's
a
sufficient
defense
under
the
rule
of
reason,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
are
not
just
competing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
with
regard
to
sales
of
the
paraphernalia
and
so
forth
that
you
have
here,
you
are
not
just
competing
among
the
members
of
the
league;
you
are
competing
in
a
market
that
includes
all
sports
paraphernalia.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
assumes
there
is
no
competition
between
the
sales
of
those
logos
and
the
sales
of
other
sports
logos.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
stewart?
would
the
antitrust
issue
before
us
be
any
different
if
instead
of
giving
an
exclusive
contract
to
one
purveyor
of
the
product,
the
commissioner
had
entered
into
a
multitude
of
different
contracts,
but
specified
a
minimum
price
in
every
one
he
specified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
fact
that
this
is
an
exclusive
agreement
is
kind
of
a
red
herring
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
--
you
certainly
could
--
they
certainly
could,
theoretically,
each
club
could
sell
it's
own
logo.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
decided
not
to
do
it
that
way,
but
it
could
be
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
maybe
they
also
collectively
decide
the
best
way
to
make
money
and
finance
--
attendance
and
so
forth,
all
agree
on
a
housing
program
that
they
all
jointly
sponsor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
the
most
effective
way
to
--
to
raise
the
money
to
pay
these
players
who
make
so
much
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
washington
redskins
football
team
has
its
own
trade
name
and
trademarks
as
to
each
as
do
each
of
the
31
other
teams
in
the
national
football
league.
since
1963
however,
all
32
teams
have
used
a
jointly
owned
corporation,
national
football
league
properties,
nflp
to
market
their
intellectual
property.
for
almost
40
years
nflp
granted
non-exclusive
licenses
to
a
number
of
different
vendors,
one
of
which
was
the
petitioner
in
this
case
american
needle.
in
2000
however
the
teams
authorized
a
nflp
to
grant
exclusive
licenses
which
it
did,
because
they
declined
to
renew
petitioner's
license
it
brought
this
action
against
the
teams
and
nflp
seeking
treble
damages
under
the
sherman
act.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
defendants,
holding
in
effect
that
the
defendants
constituted
a
single
economic
enterprise
incapable
of
conspiring
with
itself.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
we
do
not
reach
the
question
whether
petitioner
has
alleged
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
but
we
reject
the
argument
that
the
32
teams
constitute
a
single
entity
for
antitrust
purposes.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
their
conduct
must
be
judged
under
the
rule
of
reason.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
i
also
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
number
08-6261
robertson
against
watson.
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
an
improvidently
granted,
the
chief
justice
has
written
a
dissent
in
which
justices,
scalia,
kennedy
and
sotomayor
had
joined.
justice
sotomayor
has
also
filed
a
brief
dissenting
statement
that
justice
kennedy
has
joined.
