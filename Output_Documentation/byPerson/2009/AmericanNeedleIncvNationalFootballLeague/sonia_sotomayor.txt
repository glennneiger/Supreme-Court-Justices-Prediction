but
there
was
no
joint
venture
with
respect
to
the
television
rights,
meaning
there
was
no
separate
activity,
other
than
the
televising
of
the
shows
at
issue.
here,
the
solicitor
general
is
saying
there
is
a
joint
venture,
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
licensing
of
trademarks,
with
their
quality
control,
et
cetera.
isn't
that
a
substantial
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
couldn't
--
they
couldn't
stop
that
team
from
joining
another
league?
let's
assume
--
and
i
--
you
know,
i
don't
know
enough
about
football,
but
let's
assume
there
are
two
leagues
playing.
one
of
them
plays
on
saturday
and
the
other
plays
on
sunday.
you
are
suggesting
that
the
joint
venture
couldn't
stop
their
members
from
joining
that
other
league?
what's
the
purpose
of
being
in
a
venture
if
--
if
you
are
free
to
reject
it
and
go
to
somewhere
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
--
the
solicitor
general
is
asking
us
to
remand
under
his
new
test
to
find
out
whether
you
are
challenging
the
joint
venture
or
challenging
simply
the
licensing
to
one
individual
or
one
entity.
what
are
you
doing?
do
you
have
an
answer
to
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning
--
i
don't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
it
--
using
your
example,
could
you
tell
me
what
the
different
questions
would
be
under
the
single
control
theory
you
are
proposing
and
a
rule
of
reason
application
in
its
normal
course?
so
what
are
the
questions
you
would
ask
under
your
theory,
and
how
do
they
differ
from
what
would
happen
under
a
rule
of
reason
analysis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
not
go
into
this
case.
let's
--
let's
stay
with
your
single
commissioner.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
does
that
stop
any
group
of
competitors
from
coming
in
and
saying:
gee,
i
want
to
sell
my
gas;
i'm
going
to
let
this
single
commissioner
decide
how
much
my
gas
will
sell
for,
and
if
he
chooses
to
sell
it
at
the
same
price
to
everybody,
both
gas
products,
that's
okay?
how
do
you
get
to
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
did
the
teams
--
did
the
nfl
properties
or
some
centralized
entity
always
exploit
the
trademarks
of
all
the
franchises,
or
was
there
a
long
period
of
time
in
which
they
each
individually
franchised
their
products?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
was
some,
and
that
was
done
by
the
individual
teams?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
decision
could
the
sports
teams
make
that
would
be
subject
to
the
antitrust
scrutiny
under
your
definition
of
the
permissible
range
of
the
joint
venture
activities?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
venture
wanted
to
make
sure
all
the
teams
hired
secretaries
at
the
same
$1,000-a-year
salary,
that
under
your
theory,
that's
okay,
because
it's
a
joint
venture.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is,
there
is
--
you
are
seeking
through
this
ruling
what
you
haven't
gotten
from
congress:
an
absolute
bar
to
an
antitrust
claim.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
so
answer
my
question.
what
decision--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
--
if
the
reasonableness
of
this
decision,
that
t-shirts
promotes
the
game,
is
so
self-evident,
then
why
wouldn't
the
rule
of
reason
control
completely?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
do
we
need
to
even
go
to
the
single-entity
question
when,
by
your
own
answer,
it
is
undisputed,
so
abundantly
clear,
so
reasonable--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what's
the
need
to
--
to
label
it
single
entity,
as
opposed
to
label
it
what
it
is,
reasonable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
a
single
purpose
--
and
i
certainly
sympathize
with
that
argument.
but
isn't
the
proposition
of
antitrust
law
that
we
have
a
reason
for
worrying
about
concerted
activity?
we
have
a
genuine
concern
as
--
or
congress
does
--
about
independent
entities
joining
together
and
fixing
prices.
and
we
permit
them
to
do
so,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
when
the
venture
has
a
purpose
that
is
independent
than
--
from
the
individual
interest,
but
we
say,
when
it
doesn't,
we
have
to
ensure,
under
the
rule
of
reason,
that
what
they
are
doing
is
reasonable.
i'm
--
i
am
very
swayed
by
your
arguments,
but
i
can
very
much
see
a
counterargument
that
promoting
t-shirts
is
only
to
make
money.
it
doesn't
really
promote
the
game.
it
promotes
the
making
of
money.
and
once
you
fix
prices
for
making
money,
that's
a
sherman
act
violation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
own
the
trademarks,
so
they
could.
