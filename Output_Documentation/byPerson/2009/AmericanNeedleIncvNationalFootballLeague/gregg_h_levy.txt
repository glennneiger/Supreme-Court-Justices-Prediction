mr.
gregg
h.
levy
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
formation
of
a
professional
sports
league,
like
the
formation
of
any
joint
venture,
may
be
subject
to
section
1
scrutiny.
were
it
not
for
an
act
of
congress,
the
merger
of
the
national
football
league
and
the
american
football
league
in
1970
would
be
one
such
example.
but
there
is
no
challenge
to
venture
formation
here.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
nfl,
including
its
licensing
arm,
nfl
properties,
is
a
lawful
venture.
if
venture
formation
is
not
an
issue,
then
decisions
by
the
venture
about
the
venture's
product
are
unilateral
venture
decisions,
unilateral
venture
actions.
they
are
not
concerted
actions
of
the
--
of
the
venture's
members.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
your
honor,
we
know
here
that
at
least
as
of
1963,
when
nfl
properties
was
formed,
that
there
was
a
single
entity
formed,
a
single
entity
to
produce
and
promote
nfl
football.
now,
i
take
issue
with
your
suggestion
--
your
implication
that
there
was
a
decision
made
here:
let's
set
up
a
separate
line
of
business;
we
are
going
to
sell
hats
also.
that's
not
what
happened,
and
the
record
on
that
is
unambiguously
clear
here.
it's
undisputed.
plus--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
original
agreement
is
sacrosanct.
that's
why
i
suggested
that
by
1963
--
or
the
mid-1960s,
when
nfl
properties
was
formed,
there
was
venture
formation
at
that
point.
at
that
point,
what
was
the
question?
the
question
was:
how
should
the
league,
how
should
the
venture
members,
best
promote
the
venture
product?
and
the
decision
was
made
to
use
the
licenses
of
their
intellectual
property
as
a
promotional
tool.
on
that
issue,
the
discovery
and
the
record
below
was
undisputed.
there
is
documentary
evidence
from
the
nfl
properties'
articles
of
incorporation.
there
is
testimony
from
an
nfl
executive,
mr.
herzog.
and
the
best
proof,
if
there
were
any
question
about
that,
is
reflected
in
the
--
the
organic
documents
of--
nfl
properties,
which
at
the
outset
said
that,
if
there
were
any
revenues
from
the
licensing
activities,
they
would
be
donated
to
charitable
and
educational
causes.
now,
you
know,
dagher
confirmed
the
general
principle,
but
if
the
venture
is
lawfully
formed,
the
venture's
decisions
about
how
best
to
produce
and
promote
its
product
are
venture
decisions,
not
the
decisions
of
the
venture
members.
but
copperweld
provides
the
framework
that
decides
the
issue
here,
and
neither
mr.
stewart
nor
mr.
nager
mention
copperweld,
except
in
passing.
copperweld
is
the
case
by
which
this
court
turned
the
page,
if
you
will,
on
the
formalism
of
prior
cases,
including
sealy,
which
mr.
nager--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--well,
i
--
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
1970,
the
league
expanded.
there
was
a
merger.
that
merger
of
the
national
football
league
and
the
american
football
league
would
have
been
subject
to
section
1
challenge
because
it
involved
venture
formation,
but
an
act
of
congress
said
that
that
wasn't
necessary.
after
1970,
there
have
been
six
teams,
i
believe,
that
have
been
added,
essentially
created,
if
you
will,
like
adam's
rib.
they
have
been
created
from
the
other
nfl
clubs,
but
it's
essentially
the
same
venture.
the
venture
has
expanded
its
production
capability
by
adding
new
teams.
it's
expanded
its
output
by
adding
new
teams.
and
the
role
of
licensing
of
intellectual
property
throughout
that
process
has
remained
the
same.
the
role
has
been
to
promote
the
venture's
product.
it's
not--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--the
record,
your
honor,
says
--
reflects
that
there
was
very
little
exploitation
of
intellectual
property
of
the
franchises
prior
to
the
creation
of
nfl
properties.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
it
was
done,
and
it
was
done
--
i
mean,
that's
sort
of
an
historic
artifact.
it
was
done,
i
believe
collectively,
through
roy
rogers
enterprises.
but
the
--
but
the
teams
continued
to
own
their
intellectual
property.
that's
right.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
the
reason
we
know
that
this
is
not
your
typical
joint
venture
is
because
copperweld
established
a
standard
that
said
that
what
section
1
is
intended
to
regulate
is
not
matters
of
form,
not
general
market
conditions,
but
rather
the
sudden
joining
together
of
independent
sources
of
economic
power.
that's--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--but,
your
honor,
we
know
that
they
are
not
independent
sources
of
economic
power,
because
none
of
them
can
produce
the
product
of
the
venture
on
their
own.
no
nfl
club
can
produce
a
single
unit
of
production,
a
single
game
or--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--that's
right.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
your
honor,
if
--
if
this
were
a
venture
designed
to
go
out
and
license
or
manufacture
or
distribute
caps,
you
would
be
right.
but
this
is
different,
and
we
--
the
undisputed
evidence
in
the
record
below
demonstrates
it's
different.
it's
different
because
the
purpose
of
the
licensing
here
is
to
promote
the
product.
it's
to
promote
the
game.
and
the
nfl
member
clubs
are
not
independent
sources
of
economic
power
in
generating
that
game.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
yes.
it
was
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
i--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
you
100
percent
that
the
purpose
of
the
licensing
is
to
make
money,
but
not
necessarily
to
make
money
through
the
royalties.
the
purpose
of
the
licensing
is
to
improve
and
promote
the
attractiveness
of
the
game
product,
to
get
more
people
interested
in
watching
the
games
on
television,
to
get
more
people
interested
in
buying
tickets
to
the
game.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
and--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--in
the
abstract
that's
a
triable
issue,
your
honor,
but
not
here.
here,
the
record
was
undisputed.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
on
that
point.
the
record
--
there
was
evidentiary,
there
was
documentary
evidence.
there
is
evidence
that
goes
back
to
the
organic
documents
of
nfl
properties.
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
in
the
early
days,
the
--
the
net
revenues,
if
any,
the
net
royalties
of
the
licensing
operations,
went
to
charity.
so
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
question
here.
discovery
was
allowed
on
this
issue,
and
the
record
is
undisputed.
so
we
have
a
classic
case,
a
perfect,
clean
opportunity
for
this
court
to
apply
the
principles
of
copperweld
and
the
principles
of
dagher
to
an
area
of
the
law
that
has
been
troubled
for
many
years.
since
1984,
the
courts
have
wrestled
with
the
question
of
how
to
deal
with
professional
sports
leagues
and
section
1
claims
against
professional
sports
leagues.
and
the
cases
the
courts
have
been
--
have
--
and
with
the
exception
of
this
case
and
the
bulls
ii
case,
the
courts
have
been
guided
principally
by
pre-copperweld
precedent
that
rests
on
an
era
of
formalism,
an
era
when
even
an
agreement
between
a
parent
and
its
subsidiary--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--your
honor,
my
view
is
that
the
--
the
nfl
clubs
are
not
separate
sources
of
independent
power.
as
a
result,
they
are
a
unit.
they
are
a
single
entity
and
it's--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
right.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
the
answer
to
your
question
is
this:
with
regard
to
section
1
claims
--
let's
put
aside
section
2
claims.
let's
put
aside
claims
between
the
nfl
and
other
leagues.
let's
put
aside
claims
that
relate
to
nonventure
conduct,
like
the
example
of
creating
a
trucking
company
that
is
reflected
in
our
brief.
the
--
i
can
understand
an
argument,
and
we
suggested
as
much
in
our
brief
below,
that
if
the
league
engages
in
a
practice
of
representing
itself,
going
to
the
market
--
the
clubs
go
to
market
as
independent
entities.
i
can
see
an
argument
that
would
basically
say,
based
on
estoppel
principles,
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
agree
on
--
on
uniform
prices
or
uniform
wages
for
secretaries,
for
example.
we
did
--
we
made
the
point
in
our
brief
in
the
context
of
--
of
coaches.
but
even
--
even
in
the
context
of
coaches,
put
aside
for
a
moment,
section
2
remains
available
to
the
coaches
if
in
fact
they
can
demonstrate
that
there
has
been
monopolization
or
attempted
monopolization
of
a
market.
but
the
line
that
i
draw
is
the
line
between
production
and
promotion
of
the
game.
coaches
are
closer
to
production
and
promotion
of
the
game
than
secretaries,
but
i
--
you
know,
there
may
be
some
--
some
gap
there.
but
--
but
as
long
as
the
nfl
clubs
are
--
are
members
of
a
unit;
if
they
compete
as
a
unit
in
the
entertainment
marketplace,
as
--
to
use
the
language
that
justice
rehnquist
used
--
they
should
be
deemed
a
single
entity
and
not
subject
to
section
1--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--that's
not
my
position,
your
honor.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
my
position
is
based
on
the
intended
scope
of
the
sherman
act,
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
which
this
court,
in
copperweld,
made
clear.
the
principle
is
articulated
five
or
six
separate
times
in
the
copperweld
opinion
that
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
is
intended
to
regulate
the
sudden
joining
together
of
separate
sources
of
economic
power.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
the
analysis
is
not
correct
because
there
has
been
no
challenge
to
venture
formation
here.
i
don't
disagree
that
if
there
had
been
a
challenge
to
venture
formation
here,
that
the
considerations
that
you
identify
with
regard
to
panagra
would
apply.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
there
is
really
no
ambiguity
about
what
has
been
challenged.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
justice
breyer,
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
difference,
an
important
difference,
between
venture
and
nonventure
activity.
if
the
nfl
clubs
were
to
create
a
trucking
company
or
in
your
example,
would
go
off
and
build
houses,
that's
not
a
venture
activity.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--your
honor,
the
ancillary
restraints
doctrine
would
enable
the
court,
in
the
circumstance
that
you
describe,
to
categorize
the
decision
to
build
housing
as
a
non-venture
activity
--
a
non-venture
decision,
and
therefore,
it
would
be
evaluated
independently
of
the
considerations
that
apply
to
the
venturers'
objective.
but,
here,
you
cannot
separate
the
venture
activity
of
--
of
--
for
both
football--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--each
--
of
course,
each
club
could
sell
it's
own
logo,
your
honor,
but
the
clubs
have
decided
that
the
most
effective--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--forgive
me.
i
shouldn't
speak
over
you.
the
clubs
have
decided
that
the
most
effective
way
to
promote
their
product
--
to
promote
nfl
football
is
to
do
so
collectively,
to
ensure
that
the
marks
of
all
32
clubs
are
--
are
out
there,
in--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--well,
your
honor,
that
--
i
respectfully
suggest
that
doesn't--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--well,
that
doesn't
--
there
is
a
plausibility
standard
that
really
has
to
be
applied
in
terms
of
the
arguments
at
issue.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well,
but
there
is
a
difference
here,
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
record.
this
--
this
wasn't
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
it
was
decided
on
summary
judgment.
there
was
undisputed
evidence
that
the
purpose
of
the
licensing,
going
back
40
years
--
45
years,
at
this
point,
was
to
promote
the
game,
and
that's
not
an
implausible
determination
to
be
made,
but
the
--
but
the
evidence
was
undisputed.
the
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment,
and
so
--
you
know,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
--
where
there
is
the
type
of
--
you
know,
the
range
of
issues
that
needs
to
be
--
you
know,
that
needs
to
be
resolved,
of
the
kind
that
you
described.
you
know,
this
is
a
situation--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--well,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
terms
of
make
more
money
because
i
have
agreed
with
justice
scalia--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--if
--
your
honor,
just
as
in
dagher
--
in
dagher,
the
issue
was
how
to
price
the
product.
it's
a
fundamental
decision
that
any
venture
has
to
make.
this
is
a
decision
--
the
undisputed
evidence
shows
that
this
is
a
decision
about
how
to
promote
the
product,
and
that
is
no
different
from
pricing
a
product
in
terms
of
the
--
you
know,
the
operations
of
a
venture.
you
can't
--
you
can't
hope
to
market
a
product,
unless
you
have
decided
on
how
to
promote
it,
and
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
sherman
act
encourage
promotion.
they
encourage
--
copperweld
encourages
business
people
to
make
the
judgment
about
how
best
to
produce
and
to
promote
their
product
and
how
best
to
compete
in
the
marketplace.
they
made,
very
clearly,
that
they
don't
want
this
judgments
cabined
or
inhibited
or
chilled
by
--
by
decisions
by
the
court
or
decisions
by
a
jury.
but,
here,
judge
moran
did
what
we
thought
was
--
the
--
and
we
continue
to
think,
is
the
most
appropriate
way
to
serve
the
interests
of
both
the
sherman
act
and
the
considerations
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
twombly
and
other
cases,
and
that
is
to
provide
an
early
opportunity
for
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
venture
--
the
venture
conduct,
the
venture
decision
that
is
at
issue,
is
a
venture
decision
of
a
single
entity
or
whether
it's
a
collective
decision
of
the
--
of
the
venture
participants.
he
allowed
discovery
limited
to
the
single
--
single
entity
issue.
the
--
the
--
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
scope
of
discovery
here.
we
have
a
complete
record
on
this
point
that
confirms
and
addresses
the
question
that
you
presented,
that
the
purpose
of
licensing
here
is
to
promote
the
product.
but
even
if
it
weren't
--
even
if
it
weren't,
i
would
suggest
that
--
that
--
that
the
--
the
evidence
shows
that
fans
identify
with
the
logos,
and
we
are
talking
about
the
logos
and
the
marks
here,
not
because
they
have
some
sort
of
intrinsic
value,
not
because
they
--
you
know,
derive
--
they
derive
some
value
from
their
attractiveness
or
appeal,
independently
in
the
marketplace,
they
derive
their
value
from
their
identification
with
an
nfl
club
that
competes
on
the
football
field.
and
even
--
even
american
needle's
president
so
confirmed
in
the
declaration
that
he
submitted
in
the
case.
so
we
have
here
a
record
that
makes
this
--
this
judgment
for
the
court
relatively
straightforward.
it
provides
a
straightforward
opportunity
for
this
--
this
court
to
confirm
the
principles
established
in
--
established
in
copperweld
and
to
--
and
to
extend
the
principles
that
this
court
noted
in
dagher.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
have--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--the
answer--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--the
answer,
your
honor,
is
inherent
in
the
rule
of
reason.
in
the
modern
era,
defending
a
claim
like
this
on
the
merits
involves
an
investment
of
tens
of
millions
of
dollars,
thousands
of
hours
of
executive
time,
hours
and
hours
of
court
time.
in
the
salvino
case,
there
were
three
years
of
discovery
spent
on
rule
of
reason
issues--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--but,
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
almost
everything
that
you
said,
but
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
independent
sources
of
economic
power.
these
clubs
are
not
independent.
none
could
produce
their
product
on
their
own.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
they
do,
but
the
trademarks
don't
have
any
value.
they
don't
have
any
purpose
independent
of
the
game.
the
trademarks
are
invented
to
identify
the
clubs
on
the
field.
they
are
--
they
are
promoted
and
distributed
to
--
to
encourage
loyalty
among
fans
of
the
clubs.
the
--
the
trademarks
are
simply
a
tool
that
the
clubs
use
to--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--but,
your
honor,
this
case
is
the
perfect
example.
we
were
able
to
resolve
this
case
on
summary
judgment
without
incurring
the
burden
of
rule
of
reason
discovery,
and
your
reference
to
the
patriots
tractor
store
drives
home
a
distinction
that
i
think
is
worth
leaving
with
the
court
at
this
point.
this
is
not
a
situation,
like
the
situation
to
which
we
referred
in
our
brief,
where
john
deere
and
international
harvester
get
together
and
fix
the
prices
of
their
logos
for
sale
to
cap
manufacturers.
john
deere
and
international
harvester,
for
many
years
--
i
mean,
early
on,
they
gave
away
the
hats
throughout
the
midwest,
to
encourage
farmers
to
buy
their
farm
equipment.
they
are
independent
sources
of
economic
power.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well,
i
--
i
certainly
agree
with
your
--
your
premise,
your
honor,
that
they
are
worthless
apart
from
--
except
there
is
some
residual
value,
i
don't
--
i
don't--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--i
don't
dispute
--
dispute
that.
could
they
agree
on
prices
for
their
franchises
to
be
sold?
yes,
i
assume
they
could
agree
because
they
are
not
independent
sources
of
economic
power.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
your
honor--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--you
know,
i
--
i
--
i
could
bring
the
basic
point
that
i
--
i
want
to
leave
you
with,
back
to
our
example
that's
a
little
bit
closer
to
home.
in
1999
--
1919,
when
judge
covington
and
mr.
burling
went
to
joint
forces,
they
formed
a
law
firm
eventually.
ninety
years
later
that
venture
decides
on
the
prices,
the
rates
that
mr.
ludwin
and
i
will
--
will
decide
for
our
--
will
charge
for
our
services.
sometimes
that
venture,
the
firm
decides
that
we
won't
do
business
with
a
particular
client
or
that
we
will
limit
our
business
to
a
particular
client
in
a
particular
industry.
nobody
suggests
that
that
decision
of
the
venture,
a
lawful
venture,
is
subject
to
section
1
scrutiny
as
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
constitutes
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
but
if
mr.
ludwin
and
i
leave
the
--
leave
the
firm
and
we
set
up
solo
practices
and
then
decide
on
what
our
rates
are
going
to
be,
or
then
decide
on
what
our
clients
--
what
clients
we
will
serve
and
not
serve,
that
is
an
agreement
between
independent
competitors.
that's
the
fundamental
difference.
that
is
a
fundamentally
different
situation
between
--
compared
to
the
situation
of
the
firm
setting
our
rates.
and
it
reflects
the
intersection
of
copperweld
and
dagher.
it
shows
how
dagher
and
copperweld
fit
together
hand
in
glove
to
demonstrate
purposes
that
the
nfl,
for
purposes
of
promoting
its
product,
is
a
single
entity.
