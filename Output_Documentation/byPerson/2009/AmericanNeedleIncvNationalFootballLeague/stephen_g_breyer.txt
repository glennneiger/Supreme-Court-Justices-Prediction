justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
--
as
i
read
your
complaint,
almost
every
word
of
it
had
to
do
with
pro
--
per
se
violations.
so
i
forget
those
here,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
forget
--
just
yes
or
no.
i
forget
it?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i've
suddenly
heard
you
talk
--
the
only
thing
left
i
could
see
was
where
you
say
by
their
agreement
to
grant
an
exclusive
license
to
reebok,
they
unreasonably
restrained
trade
in
the
markets.
that's
what
i'm
supposed
to
focus
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
other
paragraph
do
you
want
me
to
focus
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
interested
in
the
complaint
at
the
moment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
so
i'm
looking
at
the
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
i
get
the
point.
i'm
asking
a
question.
and
i
just
heard
you
say
that
you
want,
for
example,
were
it
--
you
want
the
patriots
to
sell
t-shirts
in
competition
with
the
saints,
or
whoever.
the
red
sox.
all
right.
you
see
the
point?
the
red
sox
--
i
know
baseball
better.
you
want
the
red
sox
to
compete
in
selling
t-shirts
with
the
yankees;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
i
don't
know
a
red
sox
fan
who
would
take
a
yankees
sweatshirt
if
you
gave
it
away.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
where
you
are
going
to
get
your
expert
from
who's
going
to
say
there
is
competition
between
those
two
products.
i
think
they
would
rather
--
they
would
rather
wear
a
baseball,
a
football,
a
hockey
shirt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
are
going
to
go
back
and
prove
that
actually
there
is
competition
between
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
is
that
what
this
case
is
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have
very
small
allowances
at
three
years
old.
[laughter]
why
you
think
--
i
guess
you
have
a
right
to
that.
i'm
not
--
you
have
a
right,
but
that's
what
you
were
going
to
try
to
have
to
prove:
that
they're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
trying
to
look
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
in
my
mind
is
what
specific
restraint
you
are
focusing
on.
you
listed
three
or
four,
and
one
of
them
is
you
want,
in
effect
--
i'm
joking
about
it,
but
it's
true
--
you
are
arguing
that
the
yankees
should
compete
with
the
red
sox
in
selling
shirts.
another
thing
you
are
complaining
about,
which
is
the
one
i
understand
less,
is
that
these
teams
got
together
and
they
agreed
that
they
would
just
have
one
person
sell
all
this
stuff
together.
and
what
you
think
is
that
they
individually
should
have
decided
whether
to
choose
that
one
person,
or
maybe
to
choose
two
people,
or
three;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
find--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
find
it
easier--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
think
about
the
case
if
i
know
what's
going
on.
and
i'm
not
certain
this
is
irrelevant,
but
given
justice
scalia's
persuasive
remark,
i
will
withdraw
my
question.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
question
i
have
--
i
now
understand
this
much
better
in
light
of
that.
and
--
but
i
don't
--
and
--
and
i
see
your
point.
what
i'm
not
certain
about
is:
is
it
better
to
characterize
it
as
a
single
entity,
in
which
case
we
get
into
the
kind
of
confusion
that
i
think
exists
in
this
case?
or
just
say:
look,
it's
a
joint
venture.
if
panagra
creates
a
joint
venture,
of
course
they
are
going
to
buy
things
like
office
space
and
employees,
so
it's
reasonable
by
definition.
we
don't
even
look
into
it.
those
things
that
are
close
enough.
see,
take
your
criteria
from
17,
page
17,
which
are
excellent
criteria
in
my
mind,
and
you
say
these
are
the
criteria
by
which
we
decide
whether
those
ancillary
parts
of
a
joint
venture
that
is
itself
reasonable
are
also
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
we
wouldn't
say
per
se.
we
are
saying
that
the
justification
here:
they
are
reasonable.
why
are
they
reasonable?
because
there
is
a
legitimate
joint
venture,
and
this
is
an
ancillary
part
of
that
legitimate
joint
venture.
people
can
attack
it,
but
it's
going
to
be
no
easier
to
attack
than
if
they
tried
to
attack
what
you
call
a
single
entity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
look,
your
second
criteria
opens
it
up
to
attack
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
my
use
of
rule
of
reason
does,
because
they
are
going
to
have
to
show
it
doesn't
significantly
affect
actual
or
potential
competition.
therefore,
they
file
their
claim,
they
say
they
win
under
the
second
criteria,
and
it's
precisely
the
same
as
a
person
filing
his
claim
and
saying
it's
unreasonable.
we
are
only
talking
terminology,
but
what
worries
me
about
this
is
the
terminology,
because
i
think
that
the
lower
courts
have
taken
copperweld
terminology
and
transferred
it
to
a
place
where
it
does,
i
think,
perhaps
not
belong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem,
as
i
see,
for
you
in
this
case
is
that
the
basic
conclusion
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
where
it
says:
"viewed
in
this
light,
the
nfl
teams
are
best
described
as
a
single
source
of
economic
power
when
promoting
nfl
football
through
licensing.
"
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
their
allegation
is
that
that
isn't
true.
and
i
have
--
and
copperweld
just
seems
to
me
to
be
very
confusing
on
this,
since
--
since
my
hornbook
knowledge
of
it
was,
we
have
copperweld
to
deal
with
the
case
that
we
don't
make
booths
in
department
stores
compete
in
price
against
each
other.
all
right?
normally,
however,
we
say
independent
vendors
can't
get
together
and
say
they
fix
prices.
that's
per
se.
and
joint
ventures
are
in
the
middle,
so
we
apply
a
rule
of
reason.
now,
very
simple,
i
thought
that
has
been
the
law
since
panagra.
i
don't
know
what,
in
fact,
copperweld
has
to
do
with
it.
and
they
are
saying
that
this
basic
joint
venture
for
promoting
is
not
a
reasonable
agreement.
so
why
shouldn't
they
have
their
shot?
you
might
well
win,
but
they
want
to
make
that
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
but
that's
the
conclusion
here.
that's
not
the
--
that's
the
conclusion.
you're
--
the
question
is:
should
they
be
permitted
to
join
their
centers
of
economic
power
into
one
when
they
promote
and
sell
their
t-shirts,
sweatshirts,
et
cetera?
now,
you
can't
answer
that
question
by
announcing
the
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
can't
it
ask
someone
to
do
that.
oh.
oh,
you
are
saying
the
game.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
the
game
have
to
do
with
this?
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
t-shirts
and
helmets,
and
i
--
i
thought
it's
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world.
you
pick
up
the
phone
and
say:
"hello,
shanghai,
do
you
have
a
helmet?
"
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
this
a
summary
judgment
motion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
now
the
question
is:
are
you
basing
that
on
economic-related
data
about
the
pros
and
the
cons
of,
you
know,
the
economic
harms
of
stopping
them
from
competing,
versus
the
economic
benefits
of
allowing
them
to
act
as
a
separate
--
as
a
single
entity?
or
are
you
basing
it
on
a
pure
legal
word
called
"single
entity"?
and
what
worried
--
i
thought
when
i
read
the
opinion,
first,
of
the
district
court,
that
he's
just
following
what
i
think
started
in
the
seventh
circuit,
unfortunately,
of
taking
this
word
"single
entity"
and
throwing
around
--
throwing
it
around
all
over
the
place
and
stopping
the
economic
analysis.
but
then
when
i
read
the
last
paragraphs
of
his
opinion,
he
seems
to
be
saying
that
when
i
go
back
to
the
record,
which
you
want
me
to
do,
i
will
discover
that
there
is
lots
of
information
showing
economic
benefit
to
this
venture
of
promoting
together.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
they
could
compete,
and
so
it's
clear,
to
the
point
where
they
don't
get
to
trial,
that
this
is
a
reasonable
agreement.
all
right.
now,
is
--
have
i
--
am
i
right
in
thinking
what
you
are
thinking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
good.
then
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
wouldn't
read
--
can
you
read
copperweld
as
follows?
copperweld
is
ratifying
a
decision
by
an
entrepreneur
or
several
to
organize
his
entrepreneurial
entity
as
one
where
there
are
obvious
efficiencies
in
doing
that,
such
as
it
would
obviously
be
inefficient
to
have
the
sales
people
behind
counters
in
a
single
department
store
competing
with
each
other
in
price.
a
joint
venture
is
a
situation
where
it's
debatable
whether
or
not
there
is
that
kind
of
efficiency
in
organization,
and
therefore,
we
apply
a
rule
of
reason.
that's
panagra.
i
don't
see
anything
in
copperweld
that
is
intended
to
overrule
panagra.
and
as
long
as
panagra
is
not
overruled,
we
would
apply,
at
least
to
major
decisions
by
joint
ventures,
a
rule
of
reason.
now,
what
is
wrong
with
--
and
you
might
still
win
on
the
rule
of
reason.
but
why
isn't
that
analysis
correct?
i
am
putting
it
forward
as
a
hypothesis
for
you
to
discuss.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
--
very
definitely
a
joint
venture
here
to
play
football,
but
there
isn't
a
joint
venture
to
build
houses
and
there
isn't
a
joint
venture
obviously
in
sight
to
promote.
so
they
are
saying
that
this
is
such
a
different
activity,
the
playing
of
football
versus
the
promotion
of
a
logo,
that
we
ought
to
go
and
look
under
a
rule
of
reason
as
to
whether
a
joint
venture
in
promoting
a
logo
is
justified
in
terms
of
competition's
harms
and
economic
benefits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
would
be
if
they
tried
to
do
it,
but
there,
they
would
be
attacked
on
the
ground
that
under
the
rule
of
reason,
they
do
not
have
the
justification
such
that
the
antitrust
law
would
allow
them
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
are
saying:
and
promoting
is
precisely
the
same.
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
to
be
something
that
you
can't
decide
in
theory.
it's
a
matter
of
going
back
to
economic
facts
with
witnesses
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
let's
call
it
an
nfl
supermarket.
red
sox
supermarket,
patriots
automobile
shop,
patriots
tractor
store,
everything
becomes
patriots.
everything
--
no
competition
anywhere.
now,
you
say
that's
ridiculous,
and
once
you
say
that's
ridiculous,
you
are
now
into
the
business
of
deciding
whether
this
aspect
of
the
undeniable
legal
joint
venture
to
play
baseball
or
football,
whether
this
aspect
is
properly
the
subject
of
merger.
and
once
you
are
into
that,
you
are
into
your
$7
million,
and
i
can't
really
think
of
anything
that's
going
to
help
you
there.
and
the
sg
in
its
brief,
you
see
on
that
key,
16
and
17,
seem
to
me,
simply
reproduces
in
precisely
somewhat
different
language,
but
precisely
the
argument
you
are
now
having,
is
this
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
be
merged?
we
know
by
applying
the
rule
of
reason.
and
second,
if
it
is
merged,
is
this
particular
aspect
of
it
something
where
there
could
be
competition,
and
there
isn't
much
justification,
that's
their
rule,
too.
again,
we
are
back
to
the
rule
of
reason.
so
how
do
i
save
you
the
$7
million?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
don't
even
ask
the
question
whether
under
the
rule
of
reason
such
a
thing
is
reasonable
or
justified?
