mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
if
i
can
go
directly
to
your
question
with
respect
to
standing.
standing
has
never
been
raised
in
this--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--i
understand,
your
honor.
but
because
it
has
never
been
raised.
i
do
not
have
a
good
answer
for
you.
what
i
can
say
to
the
court
is
that
in
hibbs
--
recognizing
hibbs
was
an
establishment
clause
claim
--
the
court
struck
down
the
credit.
there
is
a
recent
case
out
of
the
first
circuit
in
coors
where
coors
reversed
their
prior
case
out
of
--
involving
the
butler
act
out
of
puerto
rico,
and
that
involved
beer
distributors
challenging
a
credit
or
an
exemption
that
puerto
rico
was--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--well--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--well,
justice
breyer,
so
--
what
i
would
say
is
that--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--and
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
and
i
guess
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
because
that
issue
was
not
raised,
based
upon
hibbs,
based
upon
the
decision
in
coors,
we
did
not
see
a
standing
issue
based
upon
this
competitive
situation
you're
talking
about.
if
in
fact
that
is
an
appropriate
question
for
additional
briefing,
we
would
obviously
welcome
that
opportunity--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--okay.
and
i
would
disagree
with
you,
justice
breyer,
for
this
reason.
there
are
already
substantial
limitations
on
when
this
type
of
case
can
be
brought.
we
start
with
the
tia.
it
says
if
we
are
--
we
can't
restrain
the
collection
of
taxes.
we
have
the
abstention
doctrines
that
have
been
mentioned.
we
have
the
fact
that
the
court
in
a
merits
situation
has
to
give
deference
to
the
states.
and
so
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
we
believe
this
is
a
very
narrow
window.
there
is
only
a
very
narrow
window
open.
what
we
are
doing
is
challenging
an
exemption
granted
to
a
competitor.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
your
honor,
i
don't
--
as
my
friend
mr.
mizer
said,
i
don't
believe
a
court
could
say:
give
them
an
exemption.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
tia.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
it
would
interrupt
--
interrupt
--
it
would
impede
the
collection
of
taxes.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
and
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
we
are
saying
that
if
we
ask
for
the
other
relief,
if
we
ask
for
us
to
get
the
exemption,
that
would
impede
state
taxes--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--we
did
include
that
phrase.
the
relief
we
are
seeking,
your
honor,
is
the
declaratory
relief
and
injunctive
relief
that
we
have
spelled
out
with
respect
to
the
exemption.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
and
that
was
not
what
we
were
seeking.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
the
response,
justice
ginsburg,
is
this.
number
one,
in
part
it
takes
away
a
tax
benefit
from
the
ldc;
in
part
it
takes
away
a
tax
benefit
from
the
customers
of
the
ldc.
i
know
that
doesn't
make
us
any
more
sympathetic.
but
the
sales
tax
is
paid
by
the
customer.
now,
with
respect
to
the
joinder
of
necessary
parties,
the
motion
that
was
filed
by
the
state,
which
started
all
of
this
3
years
ago
after
a
complaint,
also
included
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
join
necessary
parties.
that
has
also
never
been
addressed.
we
responded
to
that.
the
court
decided
not
to
refer
to
it.
we
made
an
argument
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
this
case
to
join
the
ldc's.
the
court
has
deferred
and
did
not
rule.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
well,
our
argument
was
simply,
your
honor,
that
we
are
challenging
the
exemption
issued
by
the
state.
if
the
--
two
points,
quickly.
if
the
ldcs
--
at
that
time,
four;
now
two
--
were
--
wanted
to
be
involved,
they
could
certainly
move
to
intervene.
the
second
point
was
if
the
court,
of
course,
ruled
that
they
were
necessary
parties,
then
we
would
have
the
opportunity
to
adjoin
them.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
i'm
sorry?
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
they
were
not,
your
honor.
they
were
not.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
i
cannot
identify
a
due
process
problem
there,
your
honor.
there
is
an
issue
that
has
been
raised
by
several
of
the
justices
i'd
like
to
address,
i
think
justice
stevens
in
particular,
with
respect
to:
what
if
this
went
to
state
court?
and
i
would
disagree
with
my
friend.
if
this
went
to
state
court,
we
believe
that
under
state
law
in
the
education
cases
that
mr.
mizer
were
referring
to.
it's
called
the
duroff
case,
and
we
have
the
citation
if
the
court
would
like
it.
what
the
court
said
was,
once
we
declare
the
matter
unconstitutional,
our
job
is
at
an
end;
that
it
had
to
go
back
to
the
legislature.
we
challenged
the
proposition
raised
in
the
amicus
brief
and
raised
today,
the
notion
that
if
this
was
in
a
state
court,
that
a
state
court
could
go
rewrite
this
statute--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--in
state
court.
we
conceded
that
we
could
bring
this
action
in
state
court.
we
could
seek
the
injunction
in
state
court.
we
could
seek
the
declaratory
judgment
in
state
court.
but
when
we
speak
to
remedy,
the
point
that
we
are
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
because
it
is
the
remedy
where
the
federal
court
interference
becomes
the
greatest.
what
we
are
saying
is:
we
do
not
believe
a
state
court
has
necessarily
brought
our
remedies.
and
our--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--okay.
the
point,
your
honor,
is
this:
we
believe
the
federal
court
and
the
state
court
would
have
the
power
to
declare
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
and
equal
protection
clause,
that
this
exemption
is
unconstitutional,
that
either
court
could,
at
that
point,
enjoin
prospectively
the
operation
of
that
exemption.
the
question
then
becomes:
what
happens
then?
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
i
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
yes.
but
if
i
can
try
to
bring
that
point
home,
because
i--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--if
i
could
try
to
bring
that
point
home,
justice
sotomayor.
what
we
say
is
we
are
asking
the
federal
court
to
rule
on
the
constitutionality
on
our
federal
claims,
enjoin
this
exemption
and
the
court's
work
is
at
an
end
at
that
point.
what
we
believe
will
happen
at
that
point
is
that
the
legislature
will
be
faced
with
a
choice.
how
to
deal
with
this--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--we
do
not
believe
that
the
federal
court
could
extend
that
benefit.
i
think
we
are
in
agreement
there,
justice
ginsburg.
we--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--we
questioned
whether
the
state
could.
we
questioned
whether
if
the
state
court
found
it
was
constitutional,
whether
under
ohio
law
the
state
court
could
extend
that
benefit.
we
think
this
is
a
legislative
issue.
and
there
is
a
point
i
need
to
make,
because
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
argument
today
you
are
saying
there
are
two
choices.
the
two
choices
are
you
either
extend
the
exemption
to
everyone
or
you
eliminate
the
exemption.
i
need
to
make
this
point
tying
into
mr.
mizer's
comments
about
regulation.
there
is
another
option
which
is
the
regulatory
option.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
our
utility
mandate.
it
may
be
that
the
legislature
opts
on
a
regulatory
basis
to
eliminate
this
problem
and
that
goes
to
footnote
--
the
footnote
we
have
in
the
brief--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--no,
your
honor.
no,
justice
stevens,
that's
--
that
is
not
correct
and
that
is
the
whole
basis
for
our
filing
this
complaint,
if
you
looked
at
the
complaint.
that
is
what
the
court
said
in
general
motors
v.
tracy.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
and
what
our
--
what
our
complaint
lays
out
is
the
sea
change
of
change,
we
have
gone
from
a
regulated
situation
to
essentially
an
unregulated
situation
on
the
gas
commodity
piece.
there
are
two
pieces.
there
is
delivery,
there
is
gas
commodity.
the
gas
commodity
piece
has
been
essentially
deregulated
and
that
is
what
the
court
was
focused
on
in
tracy.
what
our
complaint
very
clearly
lays
out
is
we
believe
there
has
been
a
change,
a
factual
change
in
circumstance
that
will
result
in
a
different
ruling
in
tracy.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
we
did
not
--
we
did
not
make
that
objection,
i
do
not
believe.
that
is
the
entire
discussion
of
justice
brennan
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
fair
assessment,
and
we
think
it
is
an
--
an
extremely
important
point.
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
it
has
jurisdiction.
the
question
is,
does
comity
--
should
comity
tell
it
not
to
use
that
jurisdiction.
and
what
we
are
really
fighting
about
here
is
what
are
those
standards
that
a
district
court
is
going
to
use
to
decide
whether
to
--
to
use
comity
to
not
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
and
what
we
are
saying
--
what
we
are
saying
in
our
case
is
hibbs
did
address
comity.
the
issue
was
before
the
court
in
comity
and
hibbs
said,
and
now
four
circuits
have
followed
that
ruling
in
hibbs
as
well
as
lower
courts
and
have
said,
if
you
are
not
seeking
to
impede
state
tax
collection,
comity
does
not
bar--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--and
--
and
i
think
what
we
are
trying
to
say,
justice
ginsburg,
in
our
--
in
our
case
is
we
are
not
trying
to
seek
invalidation.
we
--
we
--
we
are
not
going
to
seek
the
benefit
for
us.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
but,
your
honor,
the
point
we
are
making
is
that
some
court
somewhere
has
to
make
the
decision
whether
this
exemption
violates
the
dormant
commerce
clause
in
the
equal
protection
case.
and
it
was
our
judgment
that
the
best
forum
for
that
was
in
federal
court.
and
again,
and
i
--
and
i
--
if
i
am
not
responsive
to
your
question,
i
apologize,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that,
we
want
to
reach
the
merits
on
that
question
of
constitutionality.
and
once
that
is
done,
the
remedy
is
going
to
lie
with
the
state.
we
are
not
going
to
ask
the
federal
judge
to
decrease
our
taxes.
we
question
whether
a
state
judge
could
decrease
our
taxes.
we
want
that
declaration
and
we
want
that
injunction.
that's
what
--
that's
what
we
are
seeking
in
this
case.
and
we--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--justice
alito,
what
the
court
has
said,
not
only
this
court
but
the
first
circuit
said
in
coors,
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
says
is
that
comity
extends
broader
than
the
tia.
what
they
point
to
repeatedly
is
fair
assessment,
because
fair
assessment
got
damages
and
it
was
on
a
comity
basis
that
the
court
held
in
fair
assessment
that
you
couldn't
get
around
your
own
liability
by
bringing
a
damage
claim.
so
there's
one
example.
we
believe
to
some
extent,
national
private
truck
council
is
an
example.
because
in
national
private
truck
council,
recall
we
are
dealing
with
a
state
court
action,
not
a
federal
court
action.
in
a
national
private
truck
council
what
the
court
held
was
under
1983,
a
state
court
--
a
--
a
--
a
federal
court
would
not
order
--
a
state
court
was
not
obligated
to
grant
injunctive
relief
to
grant
attorneys
fees
under
1988,
and
that
was
based
on
comity.
in
that
case
there
was
still
an
issue
of
tax
collection
and
impeding
tax
collection,
but
certainly
that
appeared
to
us
to
be
at
least
an
example
of
where
comity
would
be
brought
in
to
tia,
because
the
tia
didn't
apply
in
--
in
national
private
truck
council.
there
was
reference
to
burford
before,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned.
this
is
not
an
abstention
case.
there
is
no
question
of
state
law
that
has
to
be
interpreted
here.
there
is
no
doubt
who
pays
the
tax
and
who
doesn't
pay
the
tax.
there
is
no
doubt
who
is
an
ldc
and
who
is
not
an
ldc.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
to
--
to
--
to
some
extent
i
believe
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but
my
response
would
be
this:
if
we
want
to
get
into
them,
what
taxes
do
they
pay,
versus
what
taxes
do
we
pay
--
that's
a
merits
question.
that's
a
merits
question.
is
this
a
compensatory
tax?
i
mean,
have
we
made
our
case
--
do
they
have
a
defense
because
they
pay
different
taxes
than
we
do
--
that
we
do,
and
therefore
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
do
that?
we
would
like
to
reach
that
question.
but
that's
a
merits
question,
that's
not
a
--
not
a
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
we
--
we
believe
it
is
not,
justice
sotomayor.
you
can
--
you
can
look
at
the
taxes
and
see
who
they
apply
to.
it
--
it
is
not
a
matter
--
i
--
i
strongly
disagree
with
--
with
my
counterpart.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
interpretation.
and
one
of
the
justices
asked
the
question
about,
was
extension
--
was
pullman
--
was
pullman
ever
raised?
pullman
was
never
raised.
my
recollection
is
that
in
the
original
motion,
they
raised
younger,
but
they
quickly
dropped
younger
because
there
is
no,
you
know,
pending
state
--
pending
state
proceeding.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
well,
but
--
very
early
on
they
raised
it.
they
dropped
it.
it
was
--
it
was
not
followed
up
on,
your
honor.
so
--
so
the
point
we
are
--
we
are
--
here's
the
point
we
are
trying
to
make,
as
we
see
it.
we
believe
the
footnote
in
hibbs
was
correct;
in
all
of
the
court's
prior
cases
there
has
been
an
issue
of
a
taxpayer
trying
to
avoid
their
own
tax
and
thus
impede
state
tax
collection.
we
read
hibbs
to
say
under
the
tia
or
comity,
you
are
not
precluded
from
original
federal
court
jurisdiction
if
you
are
not
attempting
to
impede
state
tax
collection.
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
significant
difference
between
our
case
or
that
analysis
and
the
--
the
case
in
hibbs.
as
i
said,
that
--
we
now
have
four
circuits
that
have
followed
that.
but
if
i
--
if
i
can
bring
us--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
it
--
it
could,
your
honor.
but
--
but--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--that
--
that's
right.
and
the
line
that
is
repeated
in
a
number
of
cases
is,
the
net
effect,
whether
you
are
talking
about
the
credit
in
hibbs
or
whether
you're
talking
about
the
exemption
in
our
case,
is
if
the
court
puts
on
that
order
and
the
legislature
does
not
come
up
with
a
remedy,
is
that
the
state
would
have
more
money.
in
fact
it
is
a
question
to
us,
why
--
since
we
have
chosen
to
limit
our
remedies
by
seeking
a
federal
court
forum,
it
--
it--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--what's
wrong
with
it,
your
honor,
is
because
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
fix
a
problem.
the
question
is,
are
we
forced
--
are
we
limited
only
to
seeking
a
refund?
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
what
we're
--
because
that's
not.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
the
point
that
we
tried
to
get
across
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
is
that
we
are
in
a
competitive
situation
where
we
are
trying
to
solve
a
problem,
the
problem
of
policy
that
has
been
adopted
in
ohio
or
freeing
up
this--
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
--it
does
not.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
the
problem
remains.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
well,
the
problem
remains
because
the
exemption
still
exists.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
and
i
guess
we
have
to
be
careful
with
the
term
"refund",
because
what
i
am
saying
is
--
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
primarily
--
we
have
three
taxes
to
deal
with.
one
of
them
is
the
sales
tax,
that's
what
is
paid
by
the
consumer;
that
would
require
all
the
consumers
to
seek,
you
know,
refunds.
it's
much
cleaner
in
our
view
to
simply
go
and
get
a
determination
whether
this
exemption
was
unconstitutional.
we
have
forgone
the
--
the
request
for
damages,
we
have
forgone
request
for
attorneys
fees
because
we
have
not
alleged
the
1983
claim.
we
are
trying
to
fix
a
problem.
justice
breyer,
if
i
can
in
wrapping
this
up.
we
recognize
--
we
recognize
that
this
court
has
competing
interests
that
it
has
to
weigh
in
resolving
this
question.
what
we
are
trying
to
say
is
that
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
if
you
put
that
in
context,
the
context
is
there
are
numerous
protections
that
are
already
in
place
for
the
state
to
protect
them
from
federal
court
interference,
and
we
believe
that
the
decision
in
hibbs
and
the
circuits
that
have
followed
hibbs
strikes
a
proper
balance
for
this
reason:
you
--
you
--
first
of
all
you
protect
state
tax
collection,
which
has
been
the
historic
concern
of
this
court.
second,
the
broad
jurisdiction
that
congress
has
given
in
1331
in
a
declaratory
judgment
statute,
is
harmonized
with
the
historic
comity
concerns.
third,
the
court
--
as
this
court
spoke
in
--
in
hertz,
just
very
recently,
as
opposed
to
some
vague
intrusion
test,
you
have
got
a
clear
test
that
the
court
can
apply
early
on
to
decide
whether
i
got
jurisdiction
or
not.
and
finally,
the
historic
right
of
a
plaintiff,
which
this
court
has
long
recognized
--
if
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
the
historic
right
of
a
plaintiff
to
choose
the
forum
in
which
to
have
their
claims
adjudicated
is
preserved.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
--
i
yield
my
time.
mr.
stephen
c.
fitch
thank
you,
members
of
the
court.
