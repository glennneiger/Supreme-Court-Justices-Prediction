justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
get
into
that,
i
have
a
question
that
there
may
be
an
obvious
answer
to,
but
i
haven't
found
it.
my
understanding
is
--
it's
a
standing
question.
my
understanding
is
that
they
are
asking
as
relief,
and
the
only
relief
they
ask
for,
is
to
raise
the
taxes
of
a
competitor.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
that's
correct,
i
have
found
no
case
that
--
i
haven't
looked
that
hard,
but
certainly
no
case
in
this
court
--
that
said
there
is
standing
for
a
firm
to
challenge
the
taxes
of
a
competitor
where
the
remedy
is:
raise
his
taxes.
if
there
were
standing
for
such
a
thing,
it
would
--
i'm
surprised
that
there
aren't
competitors
all
over
the
country
doing
business
out
of
state
bringing
diversity
cases
in
federal
court,
saying:
my
competitor's
taxes
should
increase;
it's
all
very
complicated,
but
the
commissioner
didn't
properly
follow
state
law.
now,
i
have
found
no
case,
certainly
not
in
this
court,
which
said:
where
all
you
want
is
to
raise
the
tax
of
a
competitor,
you
have
standing.
so
perhaps
this
is
well-settled
that
you
can
do
it,
but
i
thought
i
would
raise
that
for
both
of
you
at
the
beginning
in
case
there
is
something
you
want
to
say
about
it,
which
might
save
me
a
little
time
looking
it
all
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
no
doubt,
and
the
standing
rule
i
think
is
clear,
that
if
we're
saying
because
i
am
injured,
and
they
have
injury,
you
can't
--
you
must
give
me
reduction
in
my
tax.
that's
what
those
cases
say.
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
absolutely
clear.
you
can
do
it.
but
where
all
you
want
is
to
raise
somebody
else's
taxes,
that
i
had
thought
--
and
probably
wrongly,
but
i
had
thought
there
is
a
prudential
standing
rule
that
says
you
cannot
bring
such
a
lawsuit.
and
i
don't
see
why
you
should
be
able
to.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
nightmare
if
you
could,
which
doesn't
surprise.
so
there
we
are.
that's
the
question.
and
you
will
tell
me:
no,
it's
all
clear;
they
can
do
it.
and
i
would
like
some
citation
or
something
and
explain
why
they
should
be
able
to
do
it.
but
you
don't
want
to,
anyway.
it's
really
for
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
--
i
see
in
their
complaint,
they
ask
for
"such
other
relief
to
which
plaintiffs
are
entitled.
"
and
therefore
the
judge,
despite
what
they
say,
might
just
say:
well
what
you
are
entitled
to
is
you
are
entitled
to
pay
fewer
taxes.
is
that
a
plausible
thing,
in
which
case
it
would
interfere
with
the
revenue
collection
of
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
--
what's
your
--
you
better
give
me
your
accurate
assessment,
not
just
agree
with
me,
because
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
--
i
want
to
know
both
sides.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
have
no
idea
--
why
i
am
asking
the
question
is
i
have
no
idea
or
little
idea
of
the
underlying
state
law
merits.
and
my
suspicion
is
in
about
10
or
15
minutes
i
will
hear
that
the
state
law
merits
are
such
that
it's
virtually
impossible
that
they
are
going
to
say
to
us:
pay
fewer
taxes.
rather
they
will
say
to
our
competitors:
pay
more
taxes.
so
now
is
your
chance
to
reply
to
that
hypothetical
argument
just
in
case
they
make
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
right.
it's
in
the
jurisdictional
amount.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
might
want
to
--
in
all
the
court's
cases,
the
challenger
wanted
--
he
said:
i
don't
care;
either
make
them
pay
or
give
me
my
money
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
--
that
should
be
your
case,
i
would
have
thought.
but
you're
not
saying
it
so
you
can
get
into
federal
court.
now,
that's
how
i
read
it.
and
that
seems
--
that's
worrying
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
establishment
clause,
i
would
add,
there
is
a
lot
of
reason
for
thinking
it's
special
in
respect
to
standing,
because
there
is
no
other
way
to
challenge
the
establishment
clause.
and
that
is
a
long-festering
disagreement
within
this
court,
but
i'm
not
sure
you
can
apply
these
rules
to
everything
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
see
what
is
worrying
me.
what's
worrying
me
is,
is
there
are
businesses
all
over
the
country
and
there's
federal
tax
law,
too.
and
suddenly
people
begin
to
think:
hey,
this
is
a
terrific
idea;
i
am
going
to
go
through
my
competitor's
tax
returns
and
i
will
discover
taxes
they
should
have
paid
but
didn't,
and
all
of
a
sudden
we
will
face
a
lot
of
lawsuits
challenging
other
people's
taxes.
that's
what
is
worrying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
is
not
true
of
the
other
cases.
what
do
you
think
of
the
other
half
of
their
argument?
i'll
have
to
think
about
the
standing
thing
to
see
if
i
want
to
press
it
or
not.
but
the
other
half
is:
look
at
your
case.
your
case
would
just
be
like
--
just
like
the
other
cases,
if
you
just
said:
give
us
a
refund,
as
they
did
in
the
other
cases.
but
you
haven't
said
that,
because
that
would
run
afoul
of
the
tax
injunction
act.
rather,
what
you
have
said
is:
raise
their
taxes.
so
the
point
of
the
state
is:
now,
wait
a
minute.
leaving
all
of
the
things
aside,
you
asked
for
other
appropriate
relief,
and
it's
highly
probable
in
such
situations
that
a
court
could
--
would
say:
give
them
the
exemption.
and
if
it's
going
to
say,
give
them
the
exemption,
hey,
this
is
now
not
within
hibbs.
so
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
there's
a
lot
of
things
they
could
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
course.
of
course.
absolutely
right.
that's
what
worrying
me.
that
isn't
the
answer.
that's
the
question.
and
--
and
the
--
it's
what
justice
kennedy
said
in
respect
to
discrimination
problems.
usually,
either
remedy
is
at
issue.
you
can't
control
the
remedy
because
you
asked
for
all
other
appropriate
relief.
ergo,
it
falls
afoul
of
the
tax
injunction
act.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
ask
only
for
the
other
relief.
you
asked
for
such
other
relief
to
which
plaintiffs
are
entitled.
and
what
they
say
--
now
i
repeat
the
argument.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then,
in
your
opinion,
your
next-door
law
firm,
next
to
you,
brings
a
case
and
says:
mr.
fitch
should
pay
$1,000
more
taxes
next
year
because
he
deducted
$2,000
that
was
illegal.
you
see
that?
you
see?
now
i'm
trying
to
bring
it
home.
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
picture,
and
i
can't
quite
put
my
finger
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
your
next-door
neighbor
in
your
business,
which
would
be
a
competing
law
firm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
don't
actually
bring
you
into
the
case.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
why
isn't
this
a
hibbs?
you
read
the
--
clearly
the
other
side
says
to
read
the
footnote,
not
as
destroying
the
comity
principle.
you
know,
this
is
right
on
the
merits.
it
still
exists,
comity.
and
you
say
a
strong
case
for
withholding
the
--
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
on
grounds
of
comity
or
withhold
--
not
hearing
the
case,
is
the
natural
remedy
--
which
is
to
give
you
a
refund
--
is
available
in
state
court.
go
apply
for
a
refund.
no
problem.
and
that
--
and
the
answer,
you
know,
and
then
you
don't
get
into
all
the
problem
of
trying
to
assess
somebody
else's
liability,
et
cetera.
what
is
wrong
with
that,
precisely?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
not
give
it
--
up
to
the
state?
you
could
say
give
us
a
refund
or
raise
their
taxes,
one
or
the
other.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
doesn't
solve
the
problem
for
you
if
you
get
a
refund?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
no,
you
have
it,
too
--
they
--
they
work
it
out,
so
it
equally
applies
to
everybody
including
your
clients,
so
you
are
all
on
the
same
footing.
now
what
is
the
problem
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
found
any
authority
on
the
following
proposition:
that
a
plaintiff,
an
out-of-state
company,
brings
a
suit
in
federal
court,
where
the
normal
relief
would
be
to
give
him
a
refund.
he
says:
i
don't
want
a
refund;
i
just
want
a
declaration;
i
want
to
you
declare
this
unconstitutional.
have
you
found
any
case
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait.
forget
comity.
i'm
just
asking
you
--
i
want
to
read
the
right
authority.
can
a
person,
in
other
words,
get
around
the
tax
injunction
act
by
pleading
his
claim
and
just
saying:
i
don't
want
an
injunction;
all
i
want
is
a
declaration?
it
seems
to
me
it
should
have
come
up
in
history.
so
i
can
have
the
first
circuit
cases
to
look
at.
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
why
don't
they
win?
because
their
first
thing,
they
say:
declaration.
they
just
want
a
declaration.
strike
their
second
claim.
all
they
want
is
a
declaration.
