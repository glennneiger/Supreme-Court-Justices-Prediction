justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
--
it's
correct
--
in
relation
to
hibbs,
is
it
accurate
to
say
that
you
think
that
this
case
is
different
from
hibbs
for
essentially
three
reasons:
that
this
one
involves
a
complicated
analysis
of
state
law
and
hibbs
did
not;
that
this
one
would
potentially
have
a
substantial
financial
effect
on
the
state
and
in
hibbs
that
would
not
happen;
and
this
case
involves
claims
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
and
equal
protection
rather
than
the
establishment
clause?
does
that
--
are
those
--
does
that
capture
it
or
is
there
something
more?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
if
this
--
you
have
the
dormant
commerce
clause
claim
and
it
doesn't
require
a
complicated
analysis
of
state
law.
you
have
different
rates
of
taxation,
let's
say,
for
two
different
categories
of
entities,
and
it's
really
not
a
very
important
tax
credit,
so
pulling
the
thread
isn't
going
to
have
much
effect.
and
this
case
--
then
the
case
would
come
out
differently?
comity
would
not
bar
that
action?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
would
it
be
beyond
the
ability
of
the
arizona
courts,
had
that
case
been
--
had
hibbs
been
brought
in
arizona,
to
hold
that
under
whatever
principles
of
severability
arizona
has,
the
tax
credits
for
some
private
schools
could
not
be
stricken
without
striking
the
entire
provision?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
point
is
that
--
that
one
possible
--
if
there
was
an
establishment
clause
violation,
one
remedy
would
be
to
prohibit
credits
for
payments
made
to
religiously
affiliated
schools,
but
allow
the
credits
for
other
private
schools.
but
under
principles
of
severability,
couldn't
an
arizona
court
say
that
can't
be
severed
from
--
from
allowing
the
credits
for
payments
to
secular
private
schools?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
that
suggest
hibbs
should
have
come
out
the
other
way?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
hibbs,
were
all
the
beneficiaries
of
the
provision
that
was
challenged
parties--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--in
hibbs,
were
all
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
provision
that
was
challenged
parties
in
that
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
there
a
due
process
problem
there
because
of
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
--
do
you
recognize
that
comity
is
broader
than
the
tax
injunction
act,
and
if
it
is,
how
do
you
justify
your
argument
that
would
essentially
limit
the
comity
doctrine
to
the
contours
of
the
tax
injunction
act?
