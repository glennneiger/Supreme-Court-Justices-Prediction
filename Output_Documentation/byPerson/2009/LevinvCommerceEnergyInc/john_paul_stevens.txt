i'm
just
a
little
puzzled.
i
think
you
are
giving
the
state
court
an
awful
lot
of
power.
can
it
do
it
without
new
legislation?
they
have
to
adjust
these
other
taxes,
maybe
the
expenses
they
deduct
in
their
regulatory
filings
and
all
the
rest.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
state
court
has
any
more
authority
to
grant
a
judicial
remedy
than
the
federal
court
would
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
tax
injunction
act
goes
to
the
authority
or
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
entertain
the
case
in
the
first
place.
i'm
not
sure
the
tax
injunction
act
prohibits
the
remedy
that
you
describe,
because
there
is
a
difference
between
filing
the
suit
and
entering
relief
after
the
suit's
been
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
raises
another
--
another
problem
for
me.
your
basic
standing
is
similarly
situated
competitors,
one
is
being
taxed
and
the
other
is
not.
but
you
are
not
similarly
situated
competitors
because
they
are
regulated
utilities
and
you
are
unregulated.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
go
back
to
my
question
before.
i
understand
your
point
about
regulation
and
nonregulation,
but
--
but
your
competitors
are
subject
to
a
different
taxing
regime
than
you
are;
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
--
is
not
the
reason
they
are
subject
to
a
different
tax
regime
is
historically
they
were
in
regulated
utilities?
