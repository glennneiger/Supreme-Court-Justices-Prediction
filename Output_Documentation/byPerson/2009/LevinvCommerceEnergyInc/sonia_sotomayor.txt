justice

--state
law
is
unclear
here
that
would
require
federal
interpretation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
can't
the
pullman
doctrine
or
the
burford
doctrine,
abstention
doctrines,
be
enough
to
counsel
federal
abstention
in
this
case?
why
do
we
have
to
create
another
exception
to
hibbs
and
not
go
to
another
established
abstention
doctrine?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
did
you
--
did
you
argue
pullman
in
the
court
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no,
no.
did
you
cite
pullman
and
did
you
argue
it
on
a
pullman
abstention
basis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
that
states
have
a
law
that
said,
we
are
going
to
do
different
tax
schemes
for
african
americans
than
from
whites.
and
they
do
exactly
what
is
done
here.
they
are
going
to
tax
on
one
thing
but
not
on
another.
they
are
going
to
give
an
exemption
in
one
area,
but
not
another.
is
that
a
case
that
would
have
to
be
--
an
equal
protection
challenge
that
would
have
to
be
decided
in
state
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
if
that
is
an
answer
to
my
question
or
not.
i
--
i
--
the
only
thing
i
changed
in
the
hypothetical
was
that
the
challenge
was
an
equal
protection
challenge
race
--
based
on
a
suspect
classification.
but
the
credit
system
is
no
different.
would
or
would
not
that
require--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
claiming
that
the
federal
court
could
only
power
--
only
power
would
be
to
declare
it
unconstitutional
and
send
it
back
the
state
legislature
to
decide
what
to
do?
or
you
are
claiming
the
federal
court
has
a
power
the
state
court
doesn't
have,
which
is
to
order
the
exemption
to
be
rescinded?
i'm
not
sure
what
your
point
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you
don't
think
that
the
very
question
of
what
taxes
you
compare
and
don't
compare
is
a
matter
of
interpreting
state
law?
you
don't
think
that
the
meaning
of
state
law
in
terms
of
what
is
comparable
or
not,
is
not
implicated
by
any
of
these
questions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
you
say
that
there
is
no
impeding
of
state
court
process
or
taxes,
because
neither
a
federal
or
state
court
could
order
the
reduction
of
the
exemption--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
is
--
even
though
the
practical
consequence
is
that
that
is
a
remedy
that
the
state
could
choose,
or
must
consider.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
wasn't
an
issue,
however,
in
hibbs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
answer
your
adversary's
point
that
neither
the
federal
nor
the
state
courts
would
have
the
power
to
--
to
order
the
reverse,
to
order
the
exemption
to
be
eliminated
vis-Ã -vis
--
or
to
order
them
to
have
the
exception?
they
are
claiming
that's
a
--
even
in
state
court,
that
would
not
be
a
remedy
that
could
be
ordered.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
--
can
you
give
me
the
cite
for
that
case?
