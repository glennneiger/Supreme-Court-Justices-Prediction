well,
i
suppose
in
discrimination
cases,
if
there
is
a
discrimination
men
versus
women
one
way
to
resolve
it
would
be
to
have
either
--
either
rule
apply
to
both
sides.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
reach
that
conclusion
under
the
comity
principles
of
fair
assessment?

justice
anthony

i
am
curious
to
know
why
neither
opinion
in
hibbs
addressed
the
comity
principle
and
i
would
like
your
view
on
that.
i
know
what
you
are
thinking.
your
answer
is:
well,
you
tell
me,--
[laughter]
--but,
why
wasn't
that
addressed
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
--
just
one
more.
if
the
remedy
is
likely
to
be
we
will
leave
it
up
to
the
legislature
--
you
had
--
you
had
two
or
three
different
optional
remedies
--
would
we
say
that
that
is
an
adequate
state
remedy?

legislature?
contempt
did
you
say?
