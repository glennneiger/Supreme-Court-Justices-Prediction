justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
other
hand,
until
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
enacted,
which
--
which
eliminated
all
prudential
bars
to
standing
--
it
clearly
was
the
law
that
you
could
not
complain
about
preference,
unlawful
preference,
being
given
by
the
government
under
regulatory
provisions
to
a
competitor.
the
law
was:
that's
tough
luck.
there
was
no
standing.
and
that
was
a
prudential
law,
i
assume.
and
i
don't
know
why
it's
any
different
from
the
tax
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
this
--
but
this
doctrine,
i
--
i
am
not
very
sympathetic
to
that
argument
because
this
is
a
doctrine
that
is
directed
to
the
state
collecting
taxes,
not
to
interfering
with
state
regulation.
that
--
that's
a
different
doctrine.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
your
answer
is
that
relief
that
would
violate
the
tax
injunction
act
is
not
appropriate
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
not
covered
by
your
plea.
justice
antonin
scalia
makes
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
next-door
neighbor
has
to
be
a
competitor
of
yours
before
it
would
be
an
exact
parallel,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i
--
i
hate
to
introduce
another
procedural
glitch
into
this
thing,
but
as
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
state's
motion
to
dismiss
was
under
--
under
12(b)(1),
which
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
that
was
granted
by
the
court.
the
tia
is
assuredly
a
jurisdictional
statute,
but
i
had
never
thought
that
the
comity
doctrine
was
a
doctrine
of
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
by
--
almost
by
definition
it
says
the
court
has
jurisdiction
but
nonetheless
should
decline
to
exercise
any.
you
didn't
make
that
objection,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
did
not
make
that
objection.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
threshold
non-merits
questions
are
jurisdictional
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
case
you're
citing.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
a
volume
anywhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
fine.
it
can
be
answered
before
jurisdictional
questions,
but
you
moved
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
that
is
not
a
basis
for
dismissal
here.
the
--
the
basis
is
failure
to
state
a
claim,
i
guess,
on
which
a
federal
court
can
grant
relief.
but
i
--
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
so
--
okay.
