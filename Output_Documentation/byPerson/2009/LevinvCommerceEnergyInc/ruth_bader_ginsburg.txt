it
wasn't
brought
up
--
comity
wasn't
brought
up
in
hibbs
because
if
the
--
if
there
was
an
alleged
constitutional
violation,
then
there
was
only
one
way
to
go.
the
parochial
--
the
payments
to
the
parochial
schools
could
not
be
--
had
to
be
eliminated,
so
there
was
no
question
of
abstention
versus
invalidation
or
doing
something
else
that
was
fancy.
that's
--
that's
why
this
case
is
nothing
like
that,
because
there
was
only
one
way
--
only
one
cure.
but
you
mentioned
here
there
were
various
things.
what
--
the
federal
court
could
--
is
--
is
being
asked
to
increase
somebody
else's
taxes.
that's
a
very
strange
notion.
but
what
could
the
state
court
do?
the
same
case
in
state
court
--
and
let's
assume
there
is
a
constitutional
violation,
either
the
commerce
clause
or
the
equal
protection.
what
could
the
state
court
do
that
a
federal
court
couldn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
--
the
cases
running
up
to
hibbs,
those
were
all
cases
that
involved
racial
discrimination,
and
they
were
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
answer
--
suppose
the
answer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
there's
another
little
problem.
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
a
benefit
that
a
enjoys
is
taken
away
from
a
in
a
suit
where
a
is
not
a
party?
i
mean,
you
are
fighting
the
ohio
tax
commissioner.
you
want
to
take
a
benefit
away
from
these
ldcs,
but
they
are
not
in
the
suit.
don't
--
isn't
there
a
little
due
process
problem
with
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
that
argument?
that
you're
taking
a
benefit
--
you're
saying:
the
only
relief
we
want
is
to
take
this
benefit
away
from
people
who
are
not
in
the
lawsuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
--
why
should
the
federal
court
make
that
choice?
i
mean,
in
the
--
in
the
federal
cases
where
extension
versus
invalidation
has
come
up,
those
were
all
federal
laws
and
the
court
said
in
the
interim,
we
are
going
to
extend
the
benefit,
we
are
not
going
to
take
away
benefits
from
anyone.
every
one
of
those
cases
they
extended
a
benefit
until
--
unless
and
until
congress
acts,
but
there
was
some
comfort
there
because
they
were
dealing
--
the
federal
court
is
dealing
with
federal
legislation.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
there
is
that
choice,
the
state
courts
are
much
better
equipped
to
say
what
should
happen
in
the
interim
until
the
legislature
acts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
state
court
could.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
because
there
was
only
one
way
to
go.
either
the
benefit
is
removed
or
it's
not.
there
wasn't
the
other
possibility
of
decreasing
the
taxes
on
your
client.
there
wasn't
an
extension
versus
invalidation.
it
was
if
the
constitutional
claim
was
good,
it
had
to
be
invalidated,
the
credit
had
to
be
invalidated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
not
up
to
you
to
make
that
decision,
if
the
state
can
go
either
way.
i
mean
in
the
extension
versus
invalidation
cases
this
court
made
it
very
clear,
you
could
go
one
way
or
the
other,
and
that
was
a
decision
for
the
court
to
make,
not
the
litigant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
idea
was
the
federal
court
should
abstain.
abstention
doctrines
are
not
the
most
easy
to
grant,
so
--
but
they
did
bring
up
abstention.
