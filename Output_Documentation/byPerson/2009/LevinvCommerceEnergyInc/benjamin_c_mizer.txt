mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
are
natural
gas
suppliers
who
object
to
the
way
ohio
taxes
them.
their
suit
belongs
in
state
court
rather
than
federal
court
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
principles
of
comity
and
federalism
dictate
that
the
state
court
should
resolve
challenges
to
the
validity
of
their
own
tax
laws.
and
second,
the
tax
injunction
act
squarely
prohibits
federal
courts
from
issuing
declaratory
judgments
holding
state
tax
laws
unconstitutional.
although
either
of
these
grounds
would
independently
support
reversal
of
the
sixth
circuit
here,
the
analysis
can
really
begin
and
end
with
the
comity
doctrine,
because
that
is
where
the
lower
courts
have
shown
confusion
in
the--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that
is
how
they
have
--
that
is
the
case,
correct.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
well,
i
think
there
is
a
good
reason
that
there
--
there
aren't
cases
in
the
federal
courts
to
that
effect,
but
it's
not
a
standing
problem.
and
to
address
the
standing
point
directly,
it's
because
they
do
claim
an
injury
that
is
cognizable.
under
dennis
v.
higgins,
they
are
claiming
a
dormant
commerce
clause
injury.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
i
am
not
aware
of
any
prudential
standing
rule,
your
honor,
any
case,
but
that's
because
the
tax
injunction
act
and
the
comity
doctrine
have
always
prohibited
such
a
case.
and
so
that's
why
there's
a
lack
of
citation
in
the--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that's
right.
and
the
court
has
said
that
in
cases
like
davis
and
mckesson,
where
a
tax
credit
has
been
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
for
either
dormant
commerce
clause
or
equal
protection
reasons.
and
this
court,
in
davis
and
mckesson,
said:
well,
you
can
extend
the
credit
if
you
wish
or
you
can
also
contract
the
credit,
but
either
way--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--and
cases
would
have
existed
challenging
state
tax
laws,
regardless
of
the
apa
for
federal
challenges,
because
the
--
and
those
cases
all
would
have
existed
in
the
state
courts,
because
that
is
where
state
tax
laws
and
state
administrative
procedures
are
best
challenged.
the
--
the
rule
of
comity
holds
that
the
federal
courts
should
not
entertain
a
challenge
to
a
state
tax
law
where
that
challenge
would
either
disrupt
the
operation
of
the
state
tax
regime
or
would
intrude
into
the
meaning
or
application
of
the
state
tax
law.
both
of
those
elements
are
true
here.
this
suit
is
disruptive
because
the
suit
goes
to
the
very
core--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--at
pages
27
to
33
of
the
blue
brief,
we
identify
all
of
the
ways
in
which
the
parties,
the
state
and
the
respondents,
dispute
the
application
and
meaning
of
state
tax
law,
particularly
as
to
what
taxes
should
be
compared
for
apples
and
oranges
purposes.
and
the
tax
--
the
ohio
tax
question
that's
at
issue
is:
what
is
a
franchise
tax
versus
what
is
a
state
tax?
there
is
also
the
disruption
of
the
application
of
state
tax
law
here,
because
any
remedy
that
would
be
afforded
would
necessarily
alter
the
way
that
the
state
can
--
can
tax--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
court
doesn't
have
to
create
anything,
your
honor,
because
fair
assessment
and
great
lakes
already
say
that
the
burford
and
pullman
principles
get
sort
of
bonus
points
in
the
tax
context.
and
then--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--yes,
the
principles
of
abstention
were
argued
in
the
district
court
and--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--to
be
frank,
i
don't
know
if
pullman
was
--
was
specifically
cited,
but
that's
because
fair
assessment
itself,
which
was
heavily
cited
in
the
lower
courts,
incorporates
the
principles
of
pullman
and
burford
and
says
that
these
tax
questions
raise
--
that
these
tax
challenges
raise
questions
about
the
meaning
of
state
law,
about
the
operation
of
a
complicated
regulatory
regime,
and
so
they
are
better
left
to
the
state
court.
the
--
the
application
of
the
state
law
here
is
particularly
disruptive,
because
the
tax
laws
being
challenged
intersect
integrally
with
the
regulatory
regime.
just
to
give
one
example,
among
the
taxes
that
respondents
are
objecting
to
is
the
gross
receipts
tax,
which
public
utilities,
the
local
distribution
companies,
pay,
but
the
non-public
utilities
like
respondents
do
not
pay.
the
gross
receipts
tax
is
relevant
on
both
the
tax
and
regulatory
side
of
the
ledger,
because
it's
a
tax
but
it's
then
also
a
cost
that
as
we
explain
at
page
6
of
the
blue
brief,
may
be
included
in
the
gas
cost
recovery
formula
for
the
rate
that
the
public
utilities
may
charge
their
customers.
and
those
rates
are
approved
by
the
public
utilities
commission
of
ohio.
so
if
the
gross
receipts
tax
is
eliminated,
it
will
affect
the
regulatory
side
of
things
as
well.
and
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
hibbs.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
the
first
two
especially
capture
it,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
third
point
is
really
just
an
additional
explanation
of
the
first
two
points,
because
in
an
establishment
clause
challenge
like
hibbs,
the
remedy
is
often
going
to
be
very
simple.
in
hibbs,
for
example,
there
was
a
credit
being
challenged.
and
the
federal
court
could
simply
pull
the
thread
of
that
credit,
and
the
rest
of
the
fabric
of
the
arizona
tax
scheme
would
remain
intact.
here,
by
contrast,
if
the
thread
of
the
gross
receipts
--
sorry,
of
the
sales
tax
and
the
commercial
activities
tax
is
pulled,
the
fabric
of
the
state's
taxation
and
regulatory
regime
will
unravel.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
closer
case,
your
honor,
but
still
there
would
be
an
interest
in
allowing
the
state
courts
to
resolve
that
challenge,
because
as
the
court
has
explained,
when
a
state
court
is
--
is
trying
to
address
a
constitutional
challenge
that
involves
the
application
of
state
law,
it
can
engage
in
constitutional
avoidance
in
ways
that
the
federal
courts
cannot.
the
state
courts
also
have
greater
competency,
of
course,
with
their
own
tax
law,
and
they
have
a
greater
remedial
panoply
available
to
them.
so,
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
alito,
the
--
the
federal
court
could
not
order
a
decrease
in
the
taxes
of
the
challenger
because
that,
as
hibbs
explains,
would
be
revenue
depleting,
whereas
if
it
were
in
state
court,
the
state
court
could
decrease
the
revenue
--
sorry
--
decrease
the
taxes
of
the
challenger,
and
then
that
would
allow
the
state
courts
most
naturally
to
remedy
the--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--fair
assessment
says
in
footnote
4
that
if
it
doesn't
--
if
such
a
challenge
doesn't
require
scrutiny
of
the
meaning
and
application
of
state
laws,
then
it
may
--
fair
assessment
suggests
that
such
a
case
might
be
able
to
proceed
in
federal
court.
but
if
the
--
if
the
challenge
does
require
scrutiny
of
state
law
or
resolution
of
--
of
unclear
state
law
questions,
then
it
should
be
in
state
court,
and
there
is
no
reason--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--i
see,
your
honor.
and
if
it
were
equally
complicated,
then
it
is
a
challenge
that
should
go
to
the
state
courts,
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
state
court
can
handle
federal
constitutional
questions
and
along
the
way,
they
might
be
able
to
construe
the
state
law
in
a
way
that
avoids
the
constitutional
shoals--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--i
do,
but
also
because
the
tax
injunction
act
would
exclude
the
case
if
it
would
have
revenue
depleting
effects--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--on
the
state
coffers.
and
the
remedy
might,
in
that
case,
have
such
an
effect
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
result
is
to
tilt
the
balance
heavily
against
a
party
who
then
needs
to
have
its
own
taxes
assessed.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
well,
it
was
fully
briefed
in
hibbs,
and
that
is
i
think
why
the
court
addressed
comity
in
footnote
9.
and
footnote
9
of
hibbs
simply
says
that
the
comity
doctrine
doesn't
cover
such
a
challenge.
and
the
explanation,
i
think,
of
footnote
9
is
that
the
court
cited
both
fair
assessment
and
great
lakes.
and
those
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
when
a
--
a
tax
challenge
has
a
disruptive
effect,
for
all
practical
purposes,
on
the
collection
or
administration
of
the
state
tax
regime,
then
comity
bars
it.
and
so
when
the
court
in
footnote
9
of
hibbs
said
challenges
are
barred
by
comity
if
they
arrest
or
countermand
state
tax
collection,
it
was
--
it
was
speaking
about
the
kind
of
cases
at
issue--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--i
think
there
are
three
options
available
to
the
state
court.
first,
it
could
decrease
the
--
the
taxes
on
the
challengers,
even
if
they
don't
ask
for
such
a
decrease.
they
could
also
increase
the
challenges
--
the
taxes
on
the
local
distribution
companies,
or
they
can
do
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
done
in
the
education
context,
for
example,
which
is
to
declare
unconstitutionality
and
then
leave
it
for
the
general
assembly,
the
ohio
legislature,
to
fix
the
problem
and
then
come
back
with
a
remedy.
if
--
if
that
kind
of
relief
were
ordered
by
the
federal
court,
it
would
mean
federal
court
oversight
essentially
of
ohio
budgetary
processes,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
discouraged--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--i
think
the
entire
provision
would
have
to
be
stricken
in
hibbs
because
of
the
nature
of
the
as-applied
challenge
there.
they
were
saying
that
all
the
money
was
going
to
private
schools,
private
religious
schools--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that's
probably
right,
your
honor,
and
the
--
what
it
illustrates
is
that
often
state
courts
have
available
to
them
remedies
that
federal
courts
may
not,
particularly
when
plaintiffs
have
pleaded
the
case
in
such
a
way
as
to
tie
one
hand
behind
the
federal
court's
back.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
well,
to
be
frank,
your
honor,
the
state
of
ohio
joined
an
amicus
brief
urging
the
opposite
outcome
in
hibbs.
but
we
are
not
urging
the
overrule
of
hibbs
here.
we
think
that,
even
on
hibbs'
own
terms,
the
tax
injunction
act
applies
here
to
preclude
this
challenge
in
federal
court.
and
to
return
to
justice--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--yes,
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
because
so
long
as
the
challenger
would
be
able
then
to
--
to
seek
some
sort
of
contempt
action
if
the
--
if
the
remedy
were
not--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--of
the
--
of
the
tax
commissioner.
if
the
tax
commissioner
is
continuing
to
collect
unconstitutionally
unbalanced
taxes,
then
i
should
think
that
there
should
be
some
enforceability
there.
but
the
adequacy
of
the
challenge
available
is
--
is
measured,
as
this
court
explained
in
rosewell,
purely
by
procedural
measures.
and
so
for
--
in
rosewell
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
parties
could
go
to
state
court
and
would
procedurally
be
able
to
get
access
to
state
court
to
resolve
their
claim
and
that
is
clearly
true
and
no
one
contests
that
here.
the
--
to
return
to
justice
sotomayor's
question
about
the
--
the
racial
cases,
that
may
seem
troubling,
if
a
racial
challenge
is
excluded
from
federal
court,
but
--
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
state
courts
can
resolve
such
claims
and
in
fact
the
ohio
supreme
court
handles
tax
cases
as
a
routine
matter.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
they
were,
your
honor,
and
in
--
in
every
case
that
we
have
examined
one
of
two
things
was
true:
either
the
party
was
claiming
standing
not
based
on
the
fact
that
he
himself
was
subject
to
unconstitutional
taxes;
or
the
party
was
not
--
did
not
have
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
court.
for
example,
in
the
griffin
case
this
court
said
that
the
problem
was
that
in
virginia
nothing
was
being
done
to
remedy
the
--
the
unconstitutional
burdens
imposed
there.
and
so
the
lack
of
an
adequate
remedy
both
under
the
comity
doctrine
and
under
the
tax
injunction
act
allowed
the
plaintiffs
there
access
to
the
federal
courts.
and
so
the
comity
rule
that
we
are
advocating,
which
is
clearly
laid
out
in
both
fair
assessment
and
great
lakes,
would
not
have
any
effect
on
those
cases
because
of
the
lack
of
an
adequate
remedy.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
we
think--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
tax
injunction
act
would
bar
the
court,
i
think,
from
entering
an
order
that
says
the
taxes
on
the
challengers
are
decreased,
which
illustrates
the
reason
that
the
state
of
ohio
with
its
sovereign
interest
in
its
own
tax
policy--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the
--
the
merits
of
this
case
are
very
much
like
the
merits
of
general
motors
corporation
v.
tracy,
which
this
court
decided
about
13
years
ago.
but
the
merits
also
illustrate
the
complexity
of
any
remedy
that
--
that
would
be
ordered
in
this
case,
because
if
it's
so
simple
as
the
federal
court
simply
saying
that
the
local
distribution
companies,
the
public
utilities,
now
must
pay
the
sales
tax
and
the
commercial
activities
tax,
then
suddenly
those
entities
would
be
subject
to
five
taxes,
a
--
a
much
greater
burden
then
is
imposed
on
the
respondents.
and
then
the
general
assembly
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
to
adjust
the
taxes
on
the
local
distribution
companies.
so
even
if
the
simple
remedy
that
they
ask
for
is
entered
by
the
federal
courts,
still
the
state
of
ohio
has
to
respond
by
readjusting
its
sales
tax
and
its
commercial
activities
tax;
and
in
that
event
it
first
of
all
could
easily
end
up
in
a
net
revenue
loss
for
the
coffers
of
the
state
of
ohio.
it
also
would
mean
that
the
regulatory
side
of
thing
would
be
affected,
which
brings
us
back
to
the
burford
principles
we
discussed
earlier,
because
the
taxes,
as
i
said,
are
integrally
connected
to
the
way
ohio
regulates
public
utilities.
and
those
public
utilities
have
obligations
to
a
captive
market
that
the
respondents
don't
have
to
meet.
they
serve
customers
in
their
area
no
matter
what,
whereas
respondents
don't
have
to--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--but
your
honor,
i
think
that
great
lakes
and
fair
assessment
stand
for
the
proposition
that
when
a
federal
court
issues
an
order
that
invalidates
a
state
tax
law,
that
has
a
disruptive
effect
on
the
collection
of
taxes;
and
that
would
be
true
here
because
the
state
of
ohio
would
no
longer
be
able
--
would
not
be
able
to
collect
five
different
taxes
from
local
distribution
companies
without
being
--
turning
around
and
facing
a
new
challenge
on
--
on
unconstitutionality
of
that
burden
by
the
local
distribution
companies.
and
so
the
--
the
complicated
nature
of
the
tax-regulation
interplay
here
is
all
the
more
reason
that
this
case
belongs
in
state
court,
for
the
state
courts
to
resolve
those
interconnected
questions
in
ways
that
they
are
fully
equipped
to
answer.
the
other
factor
that
was
relevant
to
the
court's
analysis--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
state
court
might
be
able
to
enter
a
remedy,
justice
stevens,
that
is
so
simple
as
enjoining
the
sales
tax
exemption
and
the
commercial
activities
tax
exemption
for
local
distribution
companies,
and
then
also
saying
that
because
the
ldcs
have
to
pay
those
taxes
they
no
longer
have
to
pay
the
gross
receipts
tax
and
the
other
two
taxes
that
are
imposed
on
them.
that's
an
order
that
the
federal
court
couldn't
issue
because
under
principles
of
both
the
tax
injunction
act
and
the
--
and
comity--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
that
great
--
that
grace
brethren
squarely
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
federal
court
shouldn't
enter
an
order
that
says
that
the
state
tax
law
is
--
that
declares
the
state
tax
law
unconstitutional
and
then
enjoins
it.
and
that
is
exactly
what
would
be
required
in
order
to
eliminate
the
additional
taxes
on
local
distribution
companies.
and
that
analysis
is
done
at
the
front
end,
not
at
the
end
after
the
court
has
resolved
the
constitutional
merits
and
then
says,
well,
i
guess
i
am
not
able
to
enter
the
order
that
makes
the
most
sense
here
to
resolve
the
constitutional
question.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
first
off,
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
12(b)(1)
dismissal
motion.
this
court,
just
a
couple
of
terms
ago
in
the
sinochem
case,
said
that
the
--
that
a
federal
court
can
answer
questions
of
younger
abstention
before
answering
questions
of
article
3
abstention.
and
so
both
of
these,
both
the
comity
and
tia
questions
in
this
case,
are
threshold
non-merits
questions
that
can
be
reached
under
--
under
the
steel
company
approach.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
no.
the
point
isn't
that
they
are
jurisdictional;
the
point
is
that
in
sinochem
--
the
holding
in
sinochem,
for
instance,
was
that--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--it's
sinochem
v.
malaysian
--
malaysia
international
shipping.
and
the
holding
was
that
the
--
the
formula--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--i
don't
have
a
volume
number
at
the
moment.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
but
the
--
the
holding
was
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
can
be
addressed
before
jurisdictional
questions,
and
along
the
way
the
court
said
that
younger
--
specifically
said
that
younger
can
be
answered
before
article
3
standing.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
well--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--well,
in
any
event,
your
honor,
we
do
submit
that
the
tax
injunction
act
and
the
jurisdictional
doctrine
which
would
prevail.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
and
on
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
similarly
situated
or
not
similarly
situated
nature
of
public
utilities
and
nonpublic
utilities,
mr.
fitch
has
pointed
to
the
continuing
deregulation
in
the
wake
of
general
motors
corporation
v.
tracy.
but
as
the
ohio
supreme
court
just
explained
in
the
columbia
gas
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
continuing
deregulation
does
not
change
the
--
the
fundamental
holdings
in
tracy:
that
when
there
is
a
regulatory
burden
imposed
on
a
public
utility
to
serve
a
captive
market,
that
makes
that
entity
not
similarly
situated
to
other
entities.
and
the
other
point
about
tracy
and
columbia
gas
is
that
both
of
those
challenges
came
up
to
this
court
through
the
lower
courts,
through
the
state
courts
of
ohio.
and
so
the
state
courts
are
perfectly
capable
of
handling
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
i
disagree
with
that
contention,
your
honor.
the
--
ohio's
courts
have
struck
down
tax
credits
on
dormant
commerce
clause
and
equal
protection
grounds,
and
so
there
is
precedent
for
ohio
courts
dealing
with
a
challenge
like
this.
he
provides
no
citation
of
the
inability
of
state
courts--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--sure.
the
mci
telecom
corporation
v.
limbaugh.
it's
available
at
625
northeast
2d
597,
and
that's
a
1994
ohio
case.
also,
ssa
folio
collection
v.
tracy
at
73
ohio
state
third

the
sinochem
citation,
justice
scalia,
is
at
549
united
states
422.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
yes.
i
think
mr.
fitch
was
correct
to
cite
the
coors
brewing
and
u.s.
brewers
cases
out
of
the
first
circuit.
and
those
cases
illustrate
the
point
that
justice
alito
asked
about,
which
was
the
continuing
scope
of
the
comity
doctrine,
because--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
first
circuit
cases
are
the
most
on
point,
but
the
other
sister
circuits
who
have
joined
the
first
circuit
in
the
circuit
split
at
issue
in
this
case
hold
to
the
similar
effect,
and
those--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--because
of
grace
brethren,
your
honor.
if
we
are
talking
about
the
tax
injunction
act,
grace
brethren
holds
that
even
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
is
problematic
under
the
tax
injunction
act.
