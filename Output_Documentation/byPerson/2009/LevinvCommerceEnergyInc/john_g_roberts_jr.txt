justices
ginsburg
has
an
opinion
in
this
morning
in
case
09-223,
levin
versus
commerce
energy,
incorporated
and
she's
asked
me
to
announce
the
opinion.
this
case
concerns
the
proper
forum,
state
court
or
federal
court,
for
adjudication
of
a
taxpayer's
claim
that
a
state
tax
system
violates
the
federal
constitution.
the
plaintiffs
below
and
the
respondents
here
are
independent
marketers
who
compete
with
the
local
public
utilities
for
the
sale
of
natural
gas
to
ohio's
consumers.
they
brought
suit
in
federal
court
complaining
that
ohio
favors
the
public
utilities
by
according
them
certain
tax
exemptions
that
are
not
available
to
independent
marketers.
the
favoritism,
the
independent
marketers
alleged,
is
impermissible
under
the
constitution's
commerce
and
equal
protection
clauses.
in
1937
congress
adopted
the
tax
injunction
act
which
provides
that
federal
district
courts
“shall
not
restrain
the
collection
of
any
tax
imposed
by
a
state
when
a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy
is
available
in
state
court.”
the
independent
marketers
argue
that
the
act
does
not
apply
to
their
complaint
because
they
sought
no
decrease
in
their
own
tax
liability,
instead
they
wanted
ohio
to
increase
the
tax
bill
payable
by
their
competitors,
the
local
public
utilities.
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
in
favor
of
the
independent
marketers
holding
that
their
suit
could
be
maintained
in
federal
court.
we
reverse
that
determination.
a
doctrine
known
as
comity
which
antedates
the
tax
injunction
act
and
survives
its
passage,
bars
federal
court
adjudication
of
challenges
to
state
tax
laws
or
their
administration
so
long
as
plain,
adequate
and
complete
relief
is
obtainable
in
state
court.
that's
a
doctrine
more
embracive
than
the
tax
injunction
act
and
it
stops
plaintiffs
like
the
independent
marketers
here
from
resorting
to
federal
courts
in
the
first
instance
to
redress
their
complaints
about
uneven
state
taxation
of
commercial
activity.
now
in
reaching
our
decision
we
distinguish
the
court's
2004
ruling
in
a
case
called
hibbs
versus
winn.
in
that
case,
arizona
citizens
with
no
tax
liability
whatever
of
their
own
at
stake
challenged
tax
credits
said
to
serve
as
subsidies
for
parochial
school
education.
in
that
establishment
clause
context
if
plaintiffs
succeeded
on
the
merits
only
one
remedy
would
address
their
grievance,
invalidation
of
the
credits
at
issue.
in
contrast
in
the
instant
case
if
the
independent
marketer's
commerce
clause
or
equal
protection
claims
prevailed
elimination
of
the
credits
accorded
to
public
utilities
would
not
be
the
inevitable
remedy.
the
tax
bill
of
the
independent
marketers
might
be
lowered
instead
or
some
other
means
of
equalization
devised.
for
reasons
our
opinion
develops
ohio
authorities
are
best
position
to
engage
in
that
remedial
inquiry.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
saclia
joins.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
