may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
before
you
sit
down?
are
you
aware
--
maybe
you
cite
them
in
the
briefs
and
i
didn't
catch
it
--
of
any
cases
in
which
the
courts
--
a
court
of
appeals
has
dismissed
an
appeal
because
it
was
taken
before
the
--
the
civil
remedy
had
been
imposed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
those
--
in
those
--
in
that
case,
or
any
of
those
four
cases,
did
they
discuss
the
problem
of
whether
there
was
--
both
appeals
were
proper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
went
ahead
and
consolidated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
hypothetical?
supposing
the
defendant
fails
to
appeal
when
he's
sentenced,
and
then
90
days
later,
they
impose
a
restitution
order
and
he
appeals
from
that.
may
he
raise
the
issues
about
guilt
and
innocence
and
error
in
the
trial
in
that
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
--
he
can
appeal
just
the
restitution
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
question:
if
we
conclude
there's
a
hole
in
the
statute
that
congress
has
to
amend,
is
it
more
likely
that
congress
will
cure
the
statute
if
we
rule
for
you
or
if
we
rule
against
you?
it's
pretty
clear,
the
answer
to
that,
isn't
it?
