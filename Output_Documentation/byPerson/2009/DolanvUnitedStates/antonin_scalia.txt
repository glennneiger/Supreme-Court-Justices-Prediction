justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
sentence
is
not
final
until
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
what
if
--
what
if
the
court
does
set
a
date
for
additional
sentencing?
then
it's
not
final
until
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
--
what
do
you
do
about
the
further
provision
that
at
any
time
later,
if
the
government
--
or
the
victim
finds
additional
basis
for
restitution,
so
long
as
after
discovering
it,
within
60
days
after
that,
the
victim
can
come
to
the
court
and
ask
for
restitution?
what
does
that
do?
does
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
doesn't
that
necessarily
mean
that
there
are
indeed
two
final
judgments?
that
--
that
one
has
to
be
--
has
to
go
up
on
its
own,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
oh
--
"a
sentence
that
imposes
an
order--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"--
is
a
final
judgment,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
same
thing
would
happen
if
the
trial
judge
makes
a
mistake
of
law
which
causes
the
--
the
defendant
to
be
acquitted,
so
that
he
not
only
escapes
the
liability
to
the
victim,
he
escapes
any
--
any
criminal
punishment.
it
happens
all
the
time.
the
judge
makes
a
mistake;
society
pays
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
--
what
can
the
defendant
do
within
that
90
days?
he
has
to
wait
90
days
before
he
appeals
the
sentence
that
he
has
been
given;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
3
months
that--
that
he
has
to
sit
on
his
hands.
justice
antonin
scalia
must
take
it
into
account--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
read
3553
the
way
it's
written.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
have
a
question
going
just
to
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
3553,
as
--
as
i
said
--
maybe
you
shouldn't
have
agreed
--
requires
the
sentencing
court
to
consider
the
totality
of
the
sentence
it's
imposing,
including
the
restitution,
that
would
mean
that
the
judge
cannot
impose
a
sentence
before
the
expiration
of
the
90
days;
that
is,
has
to
wait
until
the
restitutionary
issue
is
resolved
to
impose
the
incarceration
part
of
the
sentence.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
within
the
90
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
restitution
sentence
was
after
the
90
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
--
it
--
it's
sort
of
a
ridiculous
consequence
that
5
years
later,
and
the
judge
who
tried
the
original
case
is
dead.
i
think
it's
bad
enough
to
have
the
issue
of
whether
this
victim
suffered
$100,000
damages
decided
by
the
judge,
if
that's
what
you're
going
to
be
sentenced
to,
but
at
least
it's
being
decided
by
the
judge
who
tried
the
case.
and
under
your
proposal,
it
can
be
decided
by
some
other
judge
who
is
just
--
just
pulled
in,
because
the
--
the
trial
judge
has
--
has
been
deceased.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
statute
establish
time
limits
for
filing
an
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
--
does
it
state
a
remedy
for
it?
i
don't
think
so.
but
if
you
don't
comply
with
the
time
limit,
you're
too
late;
you
can't
file
the
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
same
thing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
he
has
14
days
to
appeal
that.
and
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
then
later
within
the
90
days
or
even
after
the
90
days,
a
sentence
of
restitution
is
imposed,
he
can
--
he
can
appeal
that
sentence
of
restitution,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
same
grounds
on
which
he
would
have
appealed
the
--
the
sentence
of
imprisonment,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
it's
an
error
in
the
trial,
he
claims:
i
was
innocent.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
that
statute
on
imprisonment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
got
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
there's
no
amount
given?
justice
antonin
scalia
simply
because
when
you
state
an
amount,
that
amount
can
be
amended
later,
that
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
you
need
not
even
state
an
amount?
do
you
do
the
same
thing
for
imprisonment?
you
say:
i'm
going
to
send
you
to
prison;
i'm
not
sure
how
many
years,
but
i'm
going
to
send
you
to
prison.
is
that
appealable
right
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
district
courts
don't
always
do
what
they
are
supposed
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
result
that
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
criminal
judgment
of
restitution
--
i
assume
it's
the
judge
who
finds
that
the
victim
suffered
so
much
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
find
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
more
likely
than
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
a
criminal
--
it's
a
criminal
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
do
that,
tell
me
what
the
government
appeal
would
consist
of.
the
90
days
has
expired--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
--
you
tell
me
the
court
--
the
court
has
no
ability
to
impose
restitution
after
90
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
use
of
appealing?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
appellate
court
says
too
bad--
justice
antonin
scalia
--90
days
are
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
time
limit
on
the
mandatory
minimum.
