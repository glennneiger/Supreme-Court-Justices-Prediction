justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
not
really
--
you're
not
really
answering
justice
alito's
question.
he
says
he
understands
that,
as
i
understand
the
question.
we
understand
that
argument.
but
it
doesn't
address
the
fact
that
the
net
result
of
your
argument
is
(a)
unfair
to
the
victim
and
(b)
inconsistent
with
the
whole
design
and
thrust
of
the
victims
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you,
it
seems
to
me,
have
to
say:
so
be
it;
the
technical
rule
prevails.
that's
too
bad.
i
mean,
that's
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
just
want
to
make
clear
where
we
are.
justice
breyer
said,
can
the
defendant
appeal?
you
said
yes.
suppose
he
said,
must
the
defendant
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
must?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
--
even
though
he
says
the
restitution
shall
be
held
in
abeyance
pending
receipt
of
information?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
attach
no
significance
to
the
fact
that
in
this
case
the
judge
said:
i
shall
order
restitution?
it's
the
same
as
if
he
said
nothing
at
all
about
restitution,
so
far
as
you
are
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
that
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
concern
about
the
1-week
sentence
and
--
and
he's
not
concerned
--
is
that
all
criminal
defendants
know
that
an
adjudication
of
guilt
is
preclusive
of
later
issues
with
--
with
respect
to
civil
--
civil
liability,
and
they
take
their
chances.
but
that
--
that
points
up
a
difference
between
this
case
and
montalvo-murillo.
in
this
case,
finality
is
central
to
the
system,
and
that
wasn't
--
that's
not
really
--
wasn't
really
true
in
montalvo.
