justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
position
is
that
if
the
court
puts
off
the
order
of
restitution
for
90
days,
during
that
period,
the
defendant
cannot
take
an
appeal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
dramatically
contrary
to
the
way
criminal
appeals
have
been
handled
for
a
long
time?
there's
a
very
short
period
of
time
for
a
defendant
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
a
criminal
case,
and
you're
saying
that
that
is
dramatically
extended
by
the
possibility
of
--
of
restitution
later
on
or
by
the
fact
that
the
restitution
order
will
be
entered
later?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
you're
saying
the
defendant
is
--
the
defendant
is
incarcerated,
let's
say;
is
convicted,
is
sentenced
to
prison.
the
defendant
wants
to
take
a
quick
appeal.
the
defendant
thinks
he's
going
to
win
on
appeal.
and
you're
saying,
well,
no,
you
have
to
wait
90
days
before
you
can
file
your
notice
of
appeal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
is
your
position
--
how
is
your
position
consistent
with
the
thrust
of
the
victims'
rights
legislation
that
congress
has
enacted
in
recent
years,
including
the
statute
that's
before
us
here?
now,
in
this
case,
the
victim
--
the
victim's
medical
bills
were
paid
by
the
united
states.
but
that
isn't
always
going
to
be
the
case,
and
sometimes
victims
are
going
to
have
a
lot
of
lost
income.
so
you
have
the
victim,
like
the
victim
here,
who
is
beaten
to
a
pulp
by
a
defendant
and
loses
a
substantial
amount
of
future
income
as
a
result,
and
you
say
that
if
the
judge
makes
a
mistake,
it's
just
too
bad
for
the
victim.
the
victim
gets
nothing
because
the
judge
waited
too
long.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
wasn't
--
wasn't
the
whole
thrust
of
the
victims'
rights
legislation
that
up
to
that
point,
congress
thought
prosecutors
were
not
sufficiently
attending
to
the
rights
and
the
interests
of
victims?
they
were
doing
their
own
prosecutorial
thing,
but
they
weren't
involving
victims,
making
sure
they
knew
about
court
proceedings,
and
so
forth.
and
you're
saying,
well,
if
the
court
makes
a
mistake
and
the
prosecution
falls
down
in
its
responsibility,
the
person
who
suffers
is
the
victim
who
gets
victimized
again.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
isn't
there
a
difference
between
those
two
situations?
a
fine
is
a
criminal
penalty.
it
goes
--
it
--
the
prosecution
is
brought
in
the
same
of
the
sovereign.
the
fine
goes
to
the
sovereign.
it's
a
traditional
criminal
penalty.
restitution
is
not
a
traditional
criminal
penalty.
it's
much
like,
arguably,
attorneys'
fees
in
a
civil
case.
it
is
--
it
is
like
--
it
is
really
a
--
a
benefit
for
the
victim.
it
is
not
something
that
inures
to
the
benefit
of
the
sovereign.
and
so
why
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
view
that
judgment
of
restitution
as
a
separate
judgment,
just
as
the
award
of
an
attorney's
fees
is
a
separate
final
appealable
order
in
a
civil
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
can
also
include
forfeiture.
what's
--
what
is
the
rule
for
forfeiture?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference
--
in
response
to
the
last
argument
that
your
opponent
made,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
provision
here
and
rule
32(b)(1)
of
the
criminal
rules,
the
court
must
impose
sentence
without
unnecessary
delay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
--
i
didn't
understand
the
answer.
if
the
sentence
is
not
imposed
without
unnecessary
delay,
the
consequence
is
that
there
can
be
no
sentence?
