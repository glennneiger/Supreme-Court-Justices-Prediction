it
can
say
90
days.
justice

this
is
a
--
this
is,
in
one
respect,
ms.
karlan,
a
technical
argument,
is
it
not?
because
it's
true
that
this
defendant,
from
the
probation
officer's
report,
knew
within
the
90
days
what
restitution
was
going
to
be
recommended.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
functionally,
isn't
it
a
substitute
for
the
remedy
that
the
victim
of
a
crime
might
have?
wasn't
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
spare
the
victim
the
necessity
of
suing
the
defendant
and
having
this
kind
of
civil
restitution
tacked
onto
the
criminal
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
no
--
is
there
no
possibility
that
a
judge
could
say:
i
want
to
make
this
analogous
to
54(b)
under
the
civil
rules;
that
is,
i
don't
want
to
delay
the
time
that
the
defendant
can
appeal
from
the
--
from
the
--
from
the
sentence.
so
this
order
is
final,
and
3
months
later,
i'll
take
up
the
question
of
restitution
when
all
the
information
is
in.
the
court
is
prevented
from
doing
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
judge
--
but
the
judge
could
say
--
once
she
thinks
she
needs
--
that
they
need
time
for
more
information:
i'm
going
to
defer
the
whole
sentencing.
so,
defendant,
you'll
have
to
wait
3
months
to
find
out
how
much
time
you're
going
to
serve.
that
would
be
all
right.
you
could
use
the
90-day
period
to
extend
the
time
for
imposing
the
sentence.
well,
in
effect,
you're
saying
the
sentence
isn't
final,
so
she
could
change
it
any
time
within
the
90
days?

and
if
he
misses--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
heytens,
one
problem
with
the
--
we
have
said
that
notice
of
appeal
--
that
that
time
limit
is
jurisdictional,
which
means
if
the
defendant
misses
that
deadline,
no
appeal.
and
we're
leaving
this
in
a
nebulous
state
if
the
judge
says,
within
--
this
is
--
this
is
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
sentence,
but
i'm
still
thinking
about
the
restitution.
the
defendant
has
to
know
at
that
point,
must
i
appeal
that
first
judgment?
because
if
i
don't,
i'll
never
be
able
to
appeal
it.
but
on
your
reading,
the
defendant
can't
wait.
when
the
judge
imposes
a
sentence,
the
defendant
must
meet
the
time
clock
for
notice
of
appeal
from
the
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
--
that
would
mean
even
if
the
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
impose
the
restitution
order
10
days
from
now,
defendant's
time
clock
for
notice
of
appeal
would
begin
at
--
at
the
time
the
sentence
is
imposed,
not
10
days
later
when
restitution
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
this
then
becomes
a
goal,
not
a
time
line
--
a
deadline?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
rather
theoretical
because
if
that
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
judge
surely
would
have
acted
before
he
could
process
an
appeal.
