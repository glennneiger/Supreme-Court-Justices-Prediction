ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
mandatory
victim
restitution
act
makes
restitution
a
mandatory
part
of
a
defendant's
sentence
for
certain
crimes,
and
it
sets
out
two
paths
by
which
a
district
court
can
meet
its
responsibilities.
first,
section
3663a(a)(1)
authorizes
district
courts
to
impose
restitution
when
sentencing
a
defendant;
that
is,
at
the
same
time
that
they
impose
terms
of
imprisonment,
fines,
probation,
or
the
like.
second,
section
3664(d)(5)
of
the
act
allows
final
determination
of
the
amount
of
restitution
to
occur
during
a
period
not
to
exceed
90
days.
once
those
periods
and
the
general
deadlines
for
correcting
or
appealing
a
sentence
have
passed,
a
court's
judgment
is
final,
even
if
it
fails
to
order
restitution.
in
this,
the
mandatory
victim
restitution
act
is
like
all
other
mandatory
sentencing
provisions,
and
as
this
court
confirmed
2
years
ago
in
greenlaw
v.
united
states,
when
a
court
fails
to
impose
a
mandatory
sentence,
that
error
can
be
corrected
only
by
following
what
this
court
called
the
dispositive
direction
regarding
sentencing
errors--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
the
district
court
has
imposed
sentence
on
day
one
announcing
imprisonment.
any
time
during
the
next
90
days,
it
has
a
power
to
set
a
date
and
make
final
determination
of
the
restitution
amount.
once
that
90-day
period
has
run
--
in
this
case,
on
october
28th,
because
the
sentencing
occurred
on
july
30th
--
the
district
court
loses
the
authority
to
impose
restitution.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
our
position.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
justice
scalia.
it
would
be
that
once
a
court
has
started
the
sentencing
process,
it
has
90
days
within
which
to
complete
that
process,
if
it
announces
at
the
initial
sentencing
that
it
intends
to
hold
open
the
sentence
for
final
determination
of
restitution--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
it
cannot
do
that.
and
if
it
were
to
do
that
in
a
case
where
restitution
were
mandatory,
the
sentence
would
become
final,
the
government
would
file
an
appeal,
and
that
appeal
would
certainly
succeed,
because
it's
plain
error
not
to
have
to
imposed
the
restitution--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--if
the
court
has
announced
at
the
initial
sentencing
that
it
intends
to
do
so,
no,
then
it
cannot.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
justice
alito.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
a
defendant
can
only
appeal
from
a
final
sentence,
and
until
the
restitutionary
term
is
imposed
within
the
time
period
allowed
by
the
mvra,
there
is
not
a
final
sentence.
then
he
has
from
the
time
that
restitution
is--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
believe
that's
correct,
because
he
has
to
have
a
final
judgment
before
he
can
appeal.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
correct,
but
section
3664(o)
of
the
statute
says
that
the
initial
restitution
amount
constitutes
a
final
judgment,
even
though
there
can
be
amendment
after
it's
been
entered--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--in
our
brief,
it's
on
page--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it's
on
page--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes,
petition
appendix
60a.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
so
that's
why
that
has
to
be
in
there,
because
otherwise
the
defendant
really
would
be
in
the
position
that
justice
alito--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--not
in
precisely
that
way.
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
that
are
--
that
kind
of
circle
around
that.
so
for
example,
kapelushnik,
which
we
cite
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
our
brief
as
the
wisest
way
of
thinking
about
this,
held
that
once
the
90
days
has
lapsed,
the
judgment
is
final
by
operation
of
law.
there's
an
opinion
by
judge
posner
in
the
seventh
circuit
that's
not
on
restitution
but
on
a
related
issue,
which
says
that
if
you
have
several
components
to
the
sentence,
until
that
last
component
is
entered,
the
time
for
filing
an
appeal
under
f.r.a.p.
4
does
not
begin
to
run.
and
that's--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--we
were
not
required
to
do
so,
so
we
did
not.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
when
he
has
to
set
the
date.
the
statute
simply
says
the
date
has
to
be
set
so
that
final
restitution
will
occur
during
the
period
--
and
here
i
quote
again
from
the
statute
--
90
days>
["].
so
he
can
set
that
date
once
he
gets
the
information
from--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
right.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct,
he
did
not
set
it.
but
the
statute
--
i'm
now
looking
at
petition
appendix
55a,
which
is
where
section
3664(d)(5)
of
the
act
is
set
out.
it
says,
"the
court
shall
set
a
date
for
the
final
determination
of
the
victim's
losses,
not
to
exceed
90
days
after
sentencing.
"
the
90
days
modifies
the
final
determination.
it
doesn't
modify
the
setting
of
the
date.
so
within
that
90-day
period,
i
think
that
what
was--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
right.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
i
think
it
would
be
very
unwise
for
a
district
court
to
do
that,
but
the
court
can't
really
set
the
date
until
it
receives
the
information
that
it
hopes
to
receive
from
the
probation
office
or
from
the
victim.
so
that--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it
--
it
could,
yes.
or
it
could
say,
as
the
district
court
did
here,
i'm
going
to
hold
open
the
date.
but
it
can
only
hold
open
that
date
until
the
point
at
which
it
actually
imposes
the
restitution,
within
the
90
days.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
he
knew
within
the
90
days
what
the
government's
claim
was
going
to
be,
but
the
court
did
not
hold
the
hearing
and
did
not
impose
the
judgment.
and
so
the
august
8th
judgment
became
final
by
operation
of
law
on
october
28th,
because
that
was
90
days
after
the
july
30th
sentencing.
at
that
point,
the
government
could
have
filed
an
appeal
in
this
case,
and,
quite
frankly,
they
would
have
won.
as
it
was--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
i
don't--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
don't
say
that,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
first,
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
to
strike
the
balance
it
struck
in
this
statute,
which
was
to
give
victims
the
right
to
receive
restitution
as
part
of
a
criminal
sentence,
as
long
as
it
was
done
within
90
days
of
sentencing.
second,
the
government
can
appeal
if
a
court
doesn't
follow
the
rules.
third--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
what
i'm
saying
is
congress
struck
a
balance.
they
wanted
to
give
restitution
to
victims.
they
also
wanted
final
sentencing
for
defendants.
congress
struck
that
balance
by
giving
a
90-day
extension.
it
didn't
provide--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it's--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
my
argument
is
congress
struck
that
balance,
and
in
some
cases,
yes,
too
bad--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
correct,
and
congress
here
has
said
90
days.
and
they
meant
it.
if
they
had
meant
to
say,
at
any
time,
a
victim
can
receive
restitution,
they
would
have
said
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
generally,
under
this--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--because
that's--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
this
is
a
criminal
sentencing
statute
which
is
different
than
a
civil
agency
action.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that
is
the
incredibly
relevant
difference,
for
the
following
reason--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that
finality
in
sentencing
is
important,
because
otherwise
a
defendant
cannot
even
appeal
his
conviction.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
because
he--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it's
not
a
final--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--what's
contrary
to
that
is
that
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
only
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
cases
that
come
up,
in
criminal
cases,
on
final
judgment
or
under
the
collateral
order.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
this
is
not--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
with
all
respect,
justice
breyer,
there
is
no
provision
that
says
an
order
of
restitution--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
that
says--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that
a
sentence
that
includes
a
term
of
restitution
can
be
a
final
judgment,
even
though
that
60-day
provision
to
which
justice
scalia
pointed
is
on
the
books.
but
you
can't
have
a
final
judgment
in
a
criminal
case
that
involves
several
different
components
of
a
sentence
until
those
aspects
of
the
sentence
have
actually
been
imposed.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
justice
scalia,
i
believe,
was
referring
to
the
60-day
provision.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
60-day
provision
is
specifically
immunized
from
the
final
judgment
rule
by
section
3664(o)
of
the
statute.
the
90-day
provision
is
not.
so
until
a
defendant
--
perhaps
i
could
--
perhaps
i
could
use
a
slightly
different
example,
which
is:
suppose
a
defendant
is
supposed
to
be
a
sentenced
to
a
fine,
a
mandatory
fine--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--and
a
mandatory
prison
sentence.
if
you
sentence
him
to
the
mandatory
prison
sentence
and
say
i
still
need
to
calculate
the
fine
--
there
is
no
final
judgment.
he
cannot
appeal
that
sentence.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
because
this
judgment
of
restitution
is
not
a
civil
judgment.
it
is
part
of
the
defendant's
criminal
punishment,
and,
therefore,
it
is
not
like
attorneys'
fees,
something
that's
separate.
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
in
order
to
calculate
the
amount
of
imprisonment,
in
order
to
calculate
the
fine,
the
federal
criminal
sentencing
provisions
--
and
i
should
note
that
section
3664(a)
appears
in
title
18
in
the
section
under
miscellaneous
sentencing
provisions,
not
civil
provisions.
all
of
those
things
interact.
and
so
you
can't
calculate
one
of
those
without
knowing
all
of
them.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
certainly
congress's
purpose,
but
they
did
it
within
the
context
of
sentencing.
so,
for
example,
justice
ginsburg,
if
this
really
were
a
civil
penalty,
defendants
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
challenging
the
amount
of
restitution,
because
the
sixth
amendment
would
not
apply.
the
dates
for
filing
an
appeal
would
be
different.
there
would
be
a
jurisdictional
bar
that
doesn't
exist
in
criminal
cases.
this
court
said
several
times
that
restitution
under
these
kinds
of
circumstances
--
in
hughey,
under
the
predecessor
to
this
act,
and
in
kelly
v.
robinson
--
is
a
penal
statute.
justice
sotomayor
in
her
opinion
for
the
second
circuit
in
varrone
said
this
is
a
penal
statute.
so
there
is
no
question
here
that
this
is
a
substitute
for
a
civil
remedy
or
a
supplement
for
a
civil
remedy,
but
it
is
a
criminal
punishment.
and
congress
has
said
that
you
have
to
order
it
at
sentencing
or
within
90
days,
or
else
it
is
error
that
can
be
corrected
through
rule
35
or
by
appeal,
but
not
otherwise.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
there
is
not
a
final
judgment
in
his
case.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
the
final
judgment
rule
says
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
right.
and
--
and--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
think
two
things
prevent
that
interpretation.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
one
is
this
court's
precedent,
and
let
me
talk
about
that.
and
two
is
a
proper
reading
of
section
3664(o).
so
i'll
turn
first
to
the
precedent
and
then
to
3664(o).
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
so
the
precedent
is,
for
example,
this
court
said
in
parr
v.
united
states,
which
is
cited
on
page
12
of
the
reply
brief,
among
other
places,
that
"a
judgment
or
decision
is
final
for
purpose
of
appeal
only
when
it
terminates
the
litigation
between
the
parties
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
and
leaves
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
enforce
by
execution
what
has
been
determined.
"
until
restitution
has
been
determined,
a
case
does
not
fit
within
parr.
parr
is,
i
believe,
an
interpretation
of
1291,
28
u.s.c.
1291,
which
is
the
provision
that
gives
the
courts
of
appeals
jurisdiction.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
he
can.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
sentencing
statute
itself
--
18
u.s.c.
section
3553,
i
believe
it
is
--
talks
about
how
a
court,
in
sentencing
a
defendant,
is
supposed
to
be
considering
all
of
these
penalties
and
how
they
interact
with
one
another.
so
if
a
defendant
can
make
restitution
to
a
victim
by,
for
example,
being
put
on
community
release
or
probation
rather
than
serving
time
in
prison,
a
court
can
take
that
into
account
in
setting
the
sentence.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
i
think
they
must
take
it
into
account.
now,
whether
--
how
they'll
actually
strike
that
balance
is--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i'm
unaware
of
any
criminal
rules
analogue
to
rule
54(b)
in
the
civil
context,
because
in
general,
as
i
understand
the
way
this
court's
precedents
have
worked,
there
have
been
what
might
look
like
interlocutory
appeals
in
criminal
cases,
but
they've
always
involved
collateral
issues.
and
the
problem
here,
for
the
reason
that
justice
scalia
just
pointed
to,
is
restitution
and
the
amount
of
imprisonment
are
not
collateral
to
one
another;
that
is,
they
may
interact.
and
a
fine
certainly
isn't,
because
the
statute
itself
says
you
can't
impose
a
fine
to
the
extent
that
it
will
impair
restitution.
so
if--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--there's
a
slight
complication
there,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes;
that
is,
the
judge
could
delay
the
entire
sentencing
under
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
32.
look,
we're
not
saying
that
you
couldn't
get
restitution
in
a
case
like
this.
we're
simply
saying
that
you
have
to
follow
the
rules.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it
--
it
might
be.
i--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--because
you
have
to
follow
the
rules
as
laid
down.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that
is,
there
are
many
mechanisms
for
ensuring
that
a
victim--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--you
can't--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
if
--
if
you
--
you
can't
have
a
continuance
from
the
90
days.
you
can
have
a
continuance--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--of
sentencing
itself.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
think
the
way
that
the
statute
is
written
contemplates
that
the
judge
will
do
the
regular
sentencing
at
which
he
imposes
these
other
terms,
but
may
keep
it
open
for
90
days.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
that
does
that
directly
under
the
mandatory
victims
restitution
act.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
have
three
points
--
excuse
me
--
to
make:
the
first
goes
to
what
the
remedy
is
here
and
what
the
error
is
here.
the
error
here
occurred
when
the
district
court
did
not
impose
restitution.
the
government
should
have
filed
a
timely
appeal
under
rule
4.
they
had
30
days
to
do
so.
the
government
did
not
appeal
the
failure
to
make
restitution.
that
error
is
not
before
this
court
now.
what's
before
this
court
is
a
second
judgment.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
justice
sotomayor,
because
had
the
--
had
the
government
on
october
28
looked
and
said,
there's
no
restitution
order
in
this
case,
they
could
have
filed
an
appeal
then
under
rule
4,
and
they
would
have
won.
they
didn't
do
so.
second--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
he
lacks
actually
the
--
the
power
to
do
that.
once
the
appeal
is
taken,
he
can't
do
that.
and
may
i
just
say
that
here
i
think
the
critical
rule
to
understand
is
one
sentence,
one
appeal.
so
turning
first--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes,
i
have.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
but
they
do
so
in
the
context
of
section
3553(a),
which
is
cited
on
page
6
of
the
yellow
brief,
which
says
"the
court
shall
impose
a
sentence.
"
now,
the
different
components
can
each
be
added
together.
but
there
is
one
sentence
in
a
criminal
case
on
a
particular
charge,
and
that
sentence
can
include
restitution,
it
can
include
a
fine,
it
can
include
imprisonment.
that
doesn't
make
it
three
sentences.
and
only
when
all
of
those
have
been
imposed
is
there
a
final
judgment.
until
then,
the
judgment--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
don't
know
the
rule
for
forfeiture.
i
do
know
the
rule
for
all
of
the
other
criminal
proceedings,
which
is
3582(b),
to
which
the
government
refers;
3572(c)
for
fines;
3562(b)
for
community
release;
and
3664(o)
for
restitution.
all
of
those
have
to
make
one
sentence,
and
then
there
is
one
appeal.
under
our
rule,
which
i
think
comports
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
we
know
when
an
appeal
takes
place,
and
there
will
be
one
appeal.
under
the
government's
rule--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--there,
the
question
is,
did
it
do
it
without
unnecessary
delay?
here
the
question
is,
did
it
do
it
within
90
days?
when
it
didn't,
the
government
had
to
appeal.
the
government
did
not
do
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
this
court
has
never
decided
what
the
rule
means
there.
but
this
is
a
statute.
and
if
i
could
turn
to
the
question
of
what
the
statute--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--and
the
judgment
of
august
8th
became
final.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
right.
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--because
on
appeal
you
say
the
court
erred,
and
it
imposed
an
illegal
sentence--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
justice
scalia.
in
the
same
way
that
if
a
court
failed
to
impose
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
and
there
was
a
final
judgment,
the
government
could
appeal.
and
the
fact
that
the
initial
sentence
didn't
do
that
doesn't
mean
anything
at
that
point.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
but
the
--
but
--
but,
your
honor,
if
the
government
appeals
an
illegal
sentence,
that
sentence
can
be
corrected
and
the
new
mandate
from
the
court
of
appeals
saying
you
erred
in
not
imposing
mandatory
restitution
starts
the
90-day
clock
again.
now,
this
is--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
principle
that
there
must
be
one
sentence
that
determines
each
of
the
punishments
for
a
particular
crime.
