justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
is
your
argument
that
if
the
district
court
--
for
whatever
reason,
unlikely
as
it
may
be
--
starts
a
hearing
the
day
after
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
imposed
and
has
to
continue
that
hearing
for
91
days
before
it
can
render
a
judgment--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
it's
now
barred
from
entering
that
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
response
to
my
question.
it
must
impose
that
restitution
order,
complete
all
its
proceedings
within
the
90-day
period?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
can't
hold
a
hearing
over
from
the
90th
day
to
the
91st
day?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
circuit
court
who
has
addressed
this
issue
of
when
an
appeal
is
timely,
in
a
situation
in
which
a
restitution
order
has
not
been
entered
at
the
initial
sentencing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
your
view
of
things,
however,
that's
fortuity
that
the
underlying
conviction
was
still
in
the
appeal
process,
because
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
under
your
reading.
a
victim
could
come
1,
2,
5,
10,
15,
20,
or
100
years
later
and
say:
i'm
entitled
to
restitution.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
absent
prejudice
to
the
defendant,
that
would
be
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
that's
60
days
after
the
restitution
order
has
been
issued.
am
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
60
days
says
after
there
has
been
an
--
a
restitution
order.
i'm
positing
the
situation
where
the
victim
comes
10
years
later.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
says
there's
no
restitution
order.
it's
the
initial
action.
and
you're
saying
that's
okay?
it's
an
endless
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
that
that
was
a
bail
question,
where
there's
not
issues
of
finality
at
play,
and
bail
is
a
question
that
repeats
itself
throughout
the
proceedings.
defendants
are
denied
bail
and
then
make
a
different
showing
of
either
resources
or
less
danger
or
whatever,
and
they
get
out.
and
vice
versa,
defendants
are
out
and
are
put
in.
that's
it.
there
are
no
finality
questions
there.
what
do
you
do
in
this
situation
when
you're
dealing
with
a
criminal
sentence
where
there
are
finality
rules?
and
i'm
going
to
tie
that
back
to
my
starting
point,
which
is
i'm
looking
in
your
brief
for
the
precedent
and/or
legal
basis
for
us
to
treat
restitution
as
not
part
of
the
final
judgment
in
this
criminal
action.
what
--
what
other
examples
do
we
have
in
the
criminal
context?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
couldn't
do
that
until
the
end
of
the
90
days.
if
the
judge
has
90
days
to
order
restitution,
that's
a
vicious
cycle
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
not
true.
i
don't
know
if
you've
had
time
to
look
at
3582
or
35--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--those
do
appear
to
say
that
once
there's
a
term
of
imprisonment,
that
that
constitutes
a
final
judgment.
