mr.
toby
j.
heytens
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
begin
by
addressing
the
question
just
raised
by
justice
stevens,
the
government
agrees
that
we
are
not
aware
of
any
cases
that
directly
confront
this
finality
question.
there
are,
however,
at
least
four
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
where
one
of
two
things
happened:
either
the
defendant
took
an
appeal
from
the
original
term
of
his
imprisonment,
then
later
took
an
appeal
from
the
order
of
restitution
and
the
appeals
were
consolidated.
that
happened,
among
other
things,
in
the
cheal
case,
which
is
the
first
circuit
decision
cited
in
our
brief.
there
are
at
least
two
other
circuit
court
cases
that
do
that
as
well.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
no.
it--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
now--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
stevens,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
squarely--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
directly
confronts
this
issue.
now--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--the
statute--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--absent
prejudice
or
some
sort
of
double
jeopardy
problem,
that's
correct.
the
statute,
by
its
terms,
says
as
long
as
the
victim
comes
forward
within
60
days
of
the
discovery
of
his
losses,
(d)(5)
expressly
says
that
the
victim
can
do
that.
so
i
think
this--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
believe
that's
incorrect,
your
honor.
the
provision
that
we're
referring
to,
subsection
(d)(5),
is
reproduced
on
page
6a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
it's
the,
i
believe,
second
sentence
of
(d)(5)
that
we're
discussing
right
now
that
states:
"if
the
victim
subsequently
discovers
further
losses,
the
victim
shall
have
60
days
after
the
discovery
of
those
losses
in
which
to
petition
the
court
for
an
amended
restitution
order.
"
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that's
correct.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
it
is
--
it
is
certainly
not
okay,
your
honor.
congress
has
directed
that
this
determination
must
be
made
and
that
it
must
be
made
within
90
days.
and
federal
district
courts
are
required
to
comply
with
that
obligation.
but
what
congress
has
not
done
is
to
specify
a
consequence
that
occurs
in
the
situation
where
the--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
our
proposal.
congress
has
not
specified
--
congress
has
certainly
required
this
to
be
done
within
90
days.
that
meant
congress
wanted
it
to
be
done
within
90
days.
but
congress
has
not
specified
a
consequence
for--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--your
honor,
i
think
this
court
said
in
montalvo-murillo
what
the
consequence
is
in
this
category
of
cases,
which
is
when
a
trial
court
fails
to
comply
with
a
mandatory
time
limitation
for
doing
something
that
the
court
is
required
to
do,
the
remedy
is
--
unless
congress
provides
otherwise,
such
as
it
does
in
the
speedy
trial
act,
the
remedy
is
not
a
loss
of
the
power
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
act.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
the
statute
does,
your
honor.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
scalia--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--there's
a
critical
difference
between
a
statute
of
limitations
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
and
what's
happening
here
that's
illustrated
by
the
example
given
by
judge
gorsuch
in
his
opinion
for
the
courts
of
appeals.
there
can
be
two
kinds
of
time
limits.
the
first
kind
can
say,
if
you
want
to
do
something
--
you're
not
required
to
do
it
--
but
if
you
want
to
do
it,
you
have
to
do
it
within
a
certain
time.
that's
what
a
statute
of
limitations
is.
the
second
kind
of
time
limit
is
to
say
you
must
do
something
and
you
must
do
it
within
a
second
--
within
a
certain
amount
of
time.
this
case
is
the
second
category,
just
as
the
statute
at
issue
in
montalvo-murillo
was
in
the
second
category
of
cases,
and
just
as--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
cited
the
things
we
cite
in
our
brief.
there
is,
however,
also
a
statute;
i
apologize
to
the
court,
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
but
it
is
section
18
u.s.c.
section
3582(b).
that
provision
is
captioned
imposition
of
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
subsection
(b)
--
subsection
(b)
of
that
provision
says
effect
of
finality
of
the
judgment.
it
then
says,
"notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
can
subsequently
be.
"
modified
or
altered
in
certain
ways,
and
then
this
is
the
critical
language:
"a
judgment
of
conviction
that
includes
such
a
sentence
constitutes
a
final
judgment
for
all
other
purposes.
"
in
this
case
there
was
a
judgment
of
conviction.
it
was
entered
on
july
3,
2007.
and
that
judgment
of
conviction
imposed
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
on
mr.
dolan.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
yes.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
we
think
because
of
that
provision
and
because
of
general
principles
of
law.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that
certainly
establishes
the
general
rule
that
this
court
has
said
repeatedly--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
is
established
by
congress.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
the
defendant
in
our
view
is
required
to
appeal--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--once
the
district
court
enters
a
judgment
that
imposes
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
if
the
defendant
wishes
to
appeal
that
sentence
of
imprisonment
he
has
14
days
to
do
so
following
the
entry
of
the
judgment,
yes,
which
is
the
normal
rule
in
federal
criminal
cases.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
to
the
extent
that
he
has
an
objection
to
the
district
court's
--
it
depends
on
the
precise
circumstances
of
the
case,
justice
kennedy.
to
the
extent
what
he
says
is,
i
think
the
district
court
needs
to,
when
it
imposes
the
sentence
of
restitution,
take
into
account
the
other
aspects
of
the
sentence,
at
that
time
the
issues
become
interrelated.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
absolutely.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
it
--
to
the
extent--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
to
the
--
his
time
for
appealing
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
runs
from
the
entry
of
the
judgment
of
conviction,
which
is
contemporaneous
with
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
of
imprisonment.
if
he
wants
to
appeal
that,
he
needs
to
do
that
like
any
other--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--if
it's
--
if
the
judge
imposes
a
sentence
of
supervised
release,
i
am
not
aware
if
there
is
a
specific
statute.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
breyer,
first
and
foremost,
the
court
doesn't
need
to
say
anything
about
any
of
these
issues.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
for
one
very
simple
reason:
the
only
thing
that
this
defendant
has
ever
attempted
to
appeal
at
any
point
is
the
order
of
restitution.
he
never
attempted
to
appeal
from
his
guilty
plea.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
a
couple
of
reasons,
your
honor:
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
actually
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
against
their
position,
because
it
creates
the
unlikely
scenario
where
it
will
be
routinely
--
we
know
that
congress
has
authorized
these
determinations
to
be
made
up
to
90
days
after
the
imposition
of
sentence.
so
their
rule
would
create
the
situation
where
it
would
be
completely
consistent
with
congress's
intent
to
routinely
create
a
situation
where
a
federal
criminal
defendant
has
to
wait
3
months
after
sentencing
until
he
can
appeal.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
what
i'm
saying,
justice
breyer,
is
i
--
i
--
i
know
there
is
a
statute
that
governs
imprisonment.
i
believe
there
is
a
similar
statute
that
governs
a
sentence
of
probation.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
18
u.s.c.
3582(b),
justice
scalia.
i
know
there
is
a
statute
that
governs
that.
we
also
know
there
is
a
statute
governing
a
term
of
restitution
itself.
that's
the
provision
cited,
3664(o),
which
is
reproduced
at
11a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--which
is
the
rules
governing
finality
with
regard
to
an
order
imposing
restitution.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
in
our
view,
the
defendant
--
when
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
imposed
on
this
case,
which
imposed
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
on
mr.
dolan,
the
time
for
appealing
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
term
of
imprisonment
began
to
run.
if
i
could
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--that's
correct.
he
files
a
notice
of
appeal
when
the
judgment
of
conviction
is
entered,
and
then
10
days
later
he
can
file
a
second
notice
of
appeal,
and
courts
of
appeal
can
consolidate
that
case
in
the
ordinary
course.
you
don't
--
to
answer
justice
breyer's
very
specific
question
about
the
supervised
released,
i
have
been
advised
that
a
district
court
cannot
impose
a
term
of
supervised
release
unless
it
also
imposes
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
so
that
particular
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
raised
wouldn't
arise.
the
court
can't
just--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
what--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
amend
my
answer
slightly.
he
--
the
judge
is
required
to
do
it
when
sentencing--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
the
question
then
becomes
one
of
a
remedy.
the
court
is
required
to
do
it,
and
the
question
becomes
what
is
the
remedy
when
the
court
does
not.
and
what
the
court
said
in
montalvo-murillo
is
that
we
presume
that
federal
district
courts
will
comply
with
the
law,
and
that
it
is
inappropriate
in
situations
where
congress
doesn't
specify
a
remedy
for
courts
to
impose
their
own
remedy.
that
was
exactly
the
situation
in
montalvo-murillo.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
sure.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
breyer,
i'm
--
i'm
fairly
certain
there
is
a
statute
that
addresses
the
finality
when
it
comes
to
a
sentence
that
imposes
a
term
of
a
fine,
which
is
similar
to
the
statute
that
addresses
finality
of
a
judgment
of
conviction
that
imposes
only
a
term
of
imprisonment.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
breyer,
to
address
your
very
specific
fine
question,
there
is
in
fact
a
statute
that
addresses
that
as
well.
that
is
18
u.s.c.
3572(c).
it's
structured
very
similarly
to
the
--
the
section
regarding
judgments
of
imprisonment
that
i
quoted
to
the
court
earlier,
and
congress
has
addressed
that.
it
says:
"notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
sentence
to
pay
a
fine
can
subsequently
be
altered
in
various
respects,
a
judgment
that
includes
such
a
sentence
is
a
final
judgment
for
all
other--
"
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
absolutely,
justice
breyer.
that's
exactly
what
the
first
circuit
said
in
the
cheal
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
first
circuit
in
that
case
addressed
an
initial
judgment
that
said,
similarly,
somewhat,
to
the
judgment
in
this
one
--
the
original
judgment,
if
you
recall,
in
this
case
says
the
mandatory
victims
restitution
act
is
applicable;
however,
the
court
does
not
have
sufficient
information
to
calculate
restitution
at
this
time.
what
the
first
circuit
reasoned
in
cheal
is
that
that
can
be
interpreted
as
a
judgment
imposing
a
restitution
obligation,
which
is
thus
final
under
subsection
(o).
if
you
conclude
that,
you
don't
need
to
look
at
any
other
statute
to
resolve--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--yes,
justice
scalia.
because
the
one
thing
we
know
for
certain
is
that
even
if
it
had
stated
an
amount,
the
fact
that
the
amount
can
be
amended
later
doesn't
deprive
the
judgment
of
finality.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
justice
scalia,
the
district
court
is
not
permitted
to
do
any
of
this.
congress
has
required
the
district
court
to
set
the
amount--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--it's
true
that,
regrettably,
district
courts
sometimes
don't
do
what
they
are
supposed
to.
but
this
court
has
said,
most
notably
in
montalvo-murillo,
is
that
we
should
assume
that
they
will,
and
that
it's
inappropriate
for
courts
to
craft
legal
rules
that
are
based
on
the
presumption
that
they
are
going
to
violate
their
legal
obligations--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
stevens,
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
--
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
the
hypothetical
--
it's
that
the
district
court
sentences
him,
enters
a
judgment
of
conviction,
and
then
90
days
later
imposes
an
order
of
restitution?
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
okay.
in
that
situation,
no.
it
is
the
government's
view
that
he
has
--
the
time
for
appealing
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
has
run.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
just
the
restitution
order,
in
that
situation,
yes.
now,
if
he
has
appealed
them
both,
they
can
be
consolidated,
which
has
been
done
in
several
cases
in
the
courts--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
we
think
this
makes
it
an
easier
case,
in
terms
of
it
establishes
that
there
is
no
conceivable
prejudice
to
mr.
dolan
as
a
result
of
the
delay
in
this
case.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
yes,
justice
stevens.
i
think
montalvo-murillo
supplies
the
answer
to
that.
montalvo-murillo
says,
where
congress
does
not
supply
a
remedy
for
violation
of
a
statutory
time
obligation,
it
is
inappropriate
for
courts
to
invent
their
own
in
order
to
coerce
district
courts
into
complying--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
think
--
at
some
point,
it
becomes
a
debate
over
precise
wording,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
it
is
a
deadline.
i
think
congress
intended
for
district
courts
to
do
this.
i
think
district
courts
who
have
sworn
an
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
are
required
to
do
it.
the
question
is:
what
is
the
remedy
in
the
rare,
regrettable
situation
where
they
do
not
do
it?
and--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
that
would
be
--
yes.
that
would
be
our
view,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
what
i
would
say
is,
it
is,
first
of
all,
our
view
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
resolve
any
of
this.
but,
second
of
all,
one
of
the
reasons
is
there
is
another
way
the
court
could
resolve
this,
which
is
to
follow
the
approach
the
court
took
in
its
decision
in
corey
v.
united
states,
which
is
cited
in
the
blue
brief.
now,
corey
involved
a
statute.
it's
presentence
--
it's
pre-federal
sentencing
guidelines.
it
involves
a
statute
that
said
if,
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
the
district
court
feels
like
it
needs
more
information
to
decide
how
long
to
send
the
defendant
to
jail
for,
it
may
commit
the
defendant
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
for
a
period
of
either
3
to
6
months;
get,
essentially,
a
psr,
before
there
were
psrs;
and
then
make
a
determination
then.
the
court
in
corey
faced
the
question:
when
the
district
court
does
that
--
it
says,
i'm
going
to
give
you
to
the
attorney
general,
and
we'll
come
back
in
6
months
and
decide
what
your
sentence
will
be
--
when
does
the
defendant
have
to
appeal?
that
was
the
question
before
the
court
in
corey.
what
the
court
said
in
corey
is
that
the
defendant
may
appeal
either
at
the
time
he
is
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
or
at
the
time
the
district
court
imposes
the
final
sentence.
the
reason
the
court
said
that
--
this
is
the
language
that's
cited
in
the
blue
brief
--
is
the
court
said
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
tell
a
federal
criminal
defendant
that
he
might
have
to
wait
up
to
6
months
in
order
to
take
a
notice
of
appeal
from
his
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
sorry.
i
didn't
realize,
justice
breyer.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that's
our--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--no--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
apologize,
justice
breyer.
the
government's
position
is
that
at
the
time
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
are
entered,
that
is
the
time
at
which
the
defendant
has
to
appeal
and,
in
our
view,
he
may
appeal.
later,
when
the
sentence
of
restitution
is
imposed,
that
is
when
he
appeals
that.
what
i
was
suggesting
is
that,
to
the
extent
the
court
has
any
concern
about
that,
the
alternative
way
of
resolving
this
issue
would
be
the
same
way
the
court
approached
the
issue
in
corey,
and
you
could
say
that
the
defendant
could
appeal
at
either
time.
now,
we
think
that
would
be
incorrect,
but
it
would
be
open
to
the
court
to
do
so
to
--
or
to
leave
the
issue
open
in
order
to
resolve
this
case.
because
as
i
said
before,
this
defendant
never
attempted
to
appeal
his
judgment
of
conviction
or
his
original
term
of
imprisonment.
so
it's
not,
in
this
case,
necessary
to
decide
what
exactly
would
have
happened
had
he
attempted
to
do
so.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
no,
justice
scalia.
the
burden--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--that's
correct,
366.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that's
what
congress
has
provided.
and
in
this
court's
decision
in
oregon
v.
ice,
the
court,
admittedly
in
dictum,
stated
that
restitution
determinations
are
a
category
of
determinations
that
have
been
historically
made
by
the
court,
not
by
the
jury.
and
regardless
of
what
anyone
thinks
is
the
answer
to
that
question,
it
is
certainly
not
within
the
question
presented.
it
has
not
been
raised
at
any
point
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that's
certainly
correct,
justice
kennedy.
that
was
by
its
terms
a
bail
determination,
which
by
its
nature
is
not
a
final
determination
in
the
sense
that
a
criminal
statute
is,
though
the
court's
language
doesn't
really
suggest
that
that
would
make
any
difference.
and
i
would
say
that
some
of
the
other
cases
in
this
same
line
of
cases,
including
some
of
the
ones
justice
breyer
mentioned,
did
raise
finality
concerns.
there
was
a
very
strong
finality
concern
raised
in
the
peabody
coal
case.
there
were
finality
concerns
raised
in
brock,
that
congress
had
said
this
needs
to
be
done,
and
once
it's
done,
it
needs
to
be
done.
and
so,
there
are
--
some
of
the
cases
in
this
same
line
have
also
involved
finality,
admittedly
not
in
the
criminal
context.
but
i
think
the
--
the
most
important
thing
that
the
court
said
in
--
the
two
most
important
things
that
the
court
said
in
montalvo-murillo,
as
are
relevant
here,
is
that,
first,
when
congress
doesn't
specify
a
remedy
--
and
congress
has
not
specified
a
remedy
in
this
case
--
it's
inappropriate
for
courts
to
impose
their
own.
the
second
thing
that
the
court
said
is
that
we
should
presume
that
federal
district
courts
are
going
to
comply
with
legal
obligations,
and
we
shouldn't
make
rules
based
on
the
assumption
that
they
won't.
and
third
is
that
when
courts
do
impose
remedies,
they
shouldn't
make
--
impose
a
remedy
where
there's
a
profound
lack
of
fit
between
the
violation
that
occurred
and
the
remedy
that
the
defendant
is
asking
them
to
impose.
let
me
give
you
an
example
on
that.
the
general
rule
in
federal
criminal
litigation
is
that
the
federal
district
court
is
supposed
to
impose
sentence
without
unnecessary
delay.
now,
say
the
district
court
violates
that
obligation.
it
takes
too
long
to
impose
a
sentence.
i
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
suggest
that
the
remedy
of
a
district
court's
unnecessary
delay
in
sentencing
the
defendant
means
the
defendant
should
get
off
scot-free.
the
remedy
is
to
tell
the
district
court
you
have
taken
too
long
to
impose
the
sentence;
impose
the
sentence
forthwith.
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
congress
has
told
the
district
court
you
need
to
impose
restitution
in
every
case
where
the
defendant
is
convicted
of
a
crime
of
violence.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
we
don't
think
it
means
the
same
thing,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
we
think
it
means
is
the
violation
should
have
the
same
consequences.
the
violation
is
to
say
if
you
don't
do
what
you
are
supposed
to,
the
remedy
is
to
do
it
immediately.
the
remedy
isn't
to
say
you
don't
have
to
do
it
anymore.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
government
urges
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
