chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-367,
dolan
v.
united
states.
ms.
karlan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
this
--
when
the
judge
did
not
enter
a
date
for
restitution,
did
you
object
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
not?
it
seems
that
that's
when
the
violation
occurred.
the
statute
said
the
court
shall
set
a
date
if
they're
not
ready
to
calculate
the
restitution,
and
he
didn't
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it
says
--
maybe
i
am
misreading
it.
it
says
the
court
--
this
is
at
sentencing.
when
sentencing
--
you
look
at
the
previous
provision
--
what
is
it?
3663a(a)(1)--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--talks
about
what
you
do
when
sentencing
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
statute
says,
"the
court
shall
set
a
date
for
the
final
determination.
"
90
days>
["].
and
he
didn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
think
that's
right.
i
--
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
final
determination
--
the
date
for
the
--
the
final
determination
can't
exceed
90
days--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
provision
saying
the
court
shall
set
a
date
can
wait
--
that
he
can
wait
89
days
to
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
you
can
--
under
your
view,
you
can
change
the
amount
of
jail
time
up
to
the
point
at
which
you
have
to
set
the
restitution.
the
judge
says:
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
to
3
years,
and
i'm
going
to
figure
out
the
restitution.
he
looks,
and
the
restitution
turns
out
to
be
a
lot
more
than
he
thought.
so
he
says:
well,
i'm
only
going
to
give
you
2
years.
or
it's
less,
and
he
says:
i'm
going
to
give
you
4
years.
because
the
judgment
is
still
open,
he
can
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
heytens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
consequence
is
the
usual
consequence
when
trial
courts
make
errors,
which
is
to
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
let's
--
let's
suppose
there's
no
3664(d)(5),
and
we're
back
to
just
363(a)(1),
which
says
when
sentencing
a
defendant,
the
court
shall
order
restitution.
what
if
the
judge
doesn't
--
is
that
mandatory?
it
has
to
be
when
sentencing
the
defendant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
even
without
3664(d)(5),
the
judge
can
say:
i
know
it
says
when
i'm
sentencing
i've
got
to
order
restitution.
but
2
months
later,
he
can
do
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
nothing
happens
if
he
doesn't.
is
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
a
--
a
defendant
who
is
sentenced
to
a
week
in
prison,
and
he
decides,
that's
no
big
deal,
i'm
not
going
to
appeal,
and
then
finds
out,
you
know,
90
days
later
he
has
got
to
pay
a
million
dollars
in
restitution,
is
just
out
of
luck,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
your
argument
is
90
days>
["]
means
the
same
thing
as
"without
undue
delay"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
karlan,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
