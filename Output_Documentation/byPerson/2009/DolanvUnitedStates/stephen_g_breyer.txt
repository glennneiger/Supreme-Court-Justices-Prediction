justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
congress
says
--
to
paraphrase
and
not
get
it
accurate
--
that
the
department
of
transportation
shall
enact
a
rule
governing
tire
safety
within
9
months
from
the
effective
date
of
this
legislation.
and
the
department
of
transportation
fails
to
do
that.
it
doesn't
promulgate
its
law
for
18
months.
is
that
law
invalid?
the
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
is
this
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that
point.
i'm
just
asking
what's
a
relevant
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
couldn't
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
read
us
the
provision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
judge
enters
a
--
an
order,
a
final
order.
and
that
final
judgment,
as
was
true
here,
says:
i
haven't
decided
restitution
yet.
he
can
appeal.
then
what
it
says
is
when
you
get
around
to
the
restitution,
then
enter
another
judgment,
and
you'll
appeal
that,
as
happens
precisely
in
the
case
of
the
60
days
--
you
know,
that
extra
stuff
that
justice
scalia
was
referring
to.
that's
a
possible
interpretation
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
i
don't
see,
you
know,
the
appeals
thing.
i
don't
see
anything
--
i
don't
have
in
front
of
me
the
language
on
filing
an
appeal,
but
i
can't
think
of
anything
that's
contrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
final
judgment,
and
because
there
is
another
provision
that
says
an
order
of
restitution
is
itself
a
final
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
read
it
to
us.
i
mean
the
one
you
read
to
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
the
same
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
this
is
a
court-made
rule
of
what
counts
as
a
final
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
is
there
anything
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
interpreting
that
rule?
i
mean,
you
could
have
collateral
orders.
you
could
have
all
kinds
of
things.
and
doesn't
it
boil
down
to
the
same
question?
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
that
if
congress
wanted
to
make
a
90-day
deadline,
you
really
have
to
do
it,
and
you
can't
restitute
thereafter.
that's
one
thing.
but
if
they
didn't,
why
didn't
they
equally
intend
the
judgment
without
the
restitution
order
to
be
a
final
judgment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
later
on,
just
as
in
(o),
if
the
judge
does
impose
an
order
of
restitution,
then
of
course,
that's
appealable,
and
that's
a
different
judgment.
is
there
--
what
in
the
law
prevents
the
--
that
interpretation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
have
precedent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
what
about
that
as
a
possible
answer?
if
we
accept
--
the
--
the
judge,
of
course,
could
say
to
the
defendant:
i'm
not
going
to
sentence
you;
i'm
not
going
to
put
that
sentence
--
i'm
not
going
to
sentence
you
at
all--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
100
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
remedy,
then,
might
be
to
ask
for
mandamus,
if
that
was
too
long
a
period?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
--
so
why
wouldn't
that
be
similar
here?
if
the
judge
is
going
to
go
after
the
90
days,
he'd
have
the
power
to
do
it,
but
it
would
be
like
a
continuance,
and
he'd
have
to
exercise
that
reasonably.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
know.
you're
interpreting
it
literally,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
mean,
if
i
thought,
for
argument's
sake--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
congress
doesn't
care
about
whether
it's
after
90
days
--
it
was
just
to
sort
of
speed
things
up
--
on
that
assumption,
wouldn't
you
still
have
a
remedy,
because
it
would
be
like
the
unreasonable
continuance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
correct?
i've
got
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
thinking
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
thinking
of
the
general
problems--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
continuances
for
sentencing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
argument
is
that
90
days
is
long
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i've
got
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
now
suppose
--
now
we're
getting
to
exactly
the
point
where
i
thought
your
co-counsel,
your
sister
counsel
had
a
good
point
that
i
wasn't
--
hadn't
thought
through,
and
that
is
what
happens
now
in
--
on
day
--
we're
finished
the
trial.
the
sentencing
is
over.
they
got
the
presentence
report,
and
the
judge
enters
--
suppose
he
entered
a
judgment
but
didn't
say
anything
about
restitution,
because
he
says:
i'd
like
to
give
you
a
chance
to
appeal
this.
and
i'm
not
going
to
deal
with
restitution
for
a
month
when
the
victim
recovers
--
all
within
the
90
days.
can
the
defendant
appeal
that
piece
of
paper?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
because
of
this
provision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whoa,
whoa.
what
about
what
the
--
what
--
what
you
just
heard
quoted,
forgetting
this
particular
sentence
in
the
code,
was
that
a
judgment
isn't
final
--
you
can
only
appeal
a
final
judgment
until
all
the
parts
that
are
there,
and
the
restitution
is
part
of
it.
and
so
until
it's
final,
you
can't
appeal
it.
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
case
parr,
which
it
quoted.
what
is
--
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
suppose
it's
no
--
no
imprisonment;
it's
supervised
release.
now
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
mean,
what's
bothering
me
about
this,
and
i'm
not
aware
--
but
you're
quoting
a
sentence
that
wasn't
in
your
brief
and
what
i
hadn't
taken
in
at
all
is
the
extent
to
which
this
is
inextricably
mixed
up
with
the
rules
of
appeals,
which
are
very
important.
so
unless
i
have
in
my
own
mind
how
--
how
this
all
fits
together,
i
--
i
don't
know
how
to
decide
this
case.
i
don't
want
to
say
something
in
here
that's
going
to
muck
up
the
--
the
rules
of
appealing
from
a
criminal
case.
now,
what
you've
told
me
is
i'm
supposed
to
say
that
within
14
days
of
a
--
of
a
judgment
imposing
imprisonment,
he
has
to
appeal,
but
of
course
if
it's
supervised
release,
he
doesn't,
or
i'm
not
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
if
--
but
i
have
to
be
able
to
write
my
reasons,
and
in
doing
that
i
have
to
respond
to
the
argument
of
the
other
side,
which
is
that
the
strongest
reason
for
thinking
congress
intended
this
to
be
final
and
not
beyond
90
days
is
that
if
you
don't
do
that,
you
muck
up
the
rules
of
appeal.
now,
explain
to
me
why
that
isn't
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
just
what
you
say
he
has
to
do
if
the
sentence
is
supervised
release.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
we
go
back
to
my
hypothetical--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
just
substitute
the
word
"fine"
for
"supervised
release".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
an
expert
in
this
area,
as
you
can
see.
and
--
and
i
need
to
have
a
place
to
go
to
look
so
that
i
can
see
that
these
things,
in
your
view,
all
work
out,
and
you're
not
creating
some
odd
appellate
system.
do
you
have
any
suggestions
for
me
as
to
what
i
could
go
and
read
and
look
at
that
would
help
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
the
(o)
--
you
remember
--
you
know
what
i'm
referring
to
by
(o)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
can
that
be
read
to
refer
to
initial
--
an
initial
judgment
of
restitution
as
well
as
an
amended
judgment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
you
straightened
me
out,
from
your
point
of
view.
but
now
you've
mixed
me
up
again.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
think
you
said
that
the
defendant
is
just
out
of
luck.
but,
previously,
you
had
said
that
(o)
applies,
so
i
thought
what
you
were
saying
was
that
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
is
immediately
appealable
and
must
be
appealed
within
14
days
because
of
that
3582.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
you
said
(o)
applies,
and
(o)
says
that
a
sentence
that
imposes
an
order
of
restitution
is
a
final
judgment.
so
if
(o)
applies,
when,
8
months
later
or
20
months
later,
that
restitution
is
made
final
and
embodied
in
another
judgment,
that
is
a
final
judgment
which
can't
be
appealed.
so
if
you're
right
about
(o)
applying,
then
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
no,
he
is
not
out
of
luck.
now,
don't
just
agree
with
me
because
i
seem
to
be
on
your
side
in
this
question.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
got
to
figure
this
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
go
back
to
--
could
you
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
was
exactly
the
same
thing.
i
think
what
he
may
be
saying,
though,
is
it
makes
more
sense
to
read
these
statutes
as
saying
imprisonment
or
community
--
or
community
service,
a
form
of
supervised
release,
or
fines
--
i
don't
know
about
forfeiture
--
can
be
appealed
as
separate
final
judgments,
because
then
you
don't
have
to
wait
for
90
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
read
it
that
way,
it's
fairer
to
the
defendant,
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
restitution
appeal
because
of
(o).
now,
what
blocks
the
reading
--
what
blocks
the
reading
i
just
gave?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
is
dolan
versus
united
states
as
to
do
with
the
mandatory
victims
restitution
act,
which
says
“notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
when
sentencing
a
defendant
convicted
of
certain
crimes”.
the
court
shall
order
that
the
defendant
make
restitution
to
the
victim.
now
later
provision
of
the
act
says
“if
the
victim's
losses
are
not
ascertainable
by
the
date,
that
is
ten
days
prior
to
sentencing,
the
court
shall
set
a
date
for
the
final
determination
of
the
victim's
losses,
not
to
exceed
90
days
after
sentencing”.
in
this
case,
the
sentencing
judge
made
clear
in
his
initial
judgment
that
he
would
order
restitution
but
he
couldn't
determine
or
didn't
determine
the
precise
amount
of
the
victims
loss
until
more
than
those
90
days
of
past,
indeed
three
months
had
passed.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
sentencing
court
have
the
power
to
ascertain
the
victims
loss
at
that
later
time.
we
conclude
that
the
judge
did
possess
that
power.
why?
well
this
court
has
sometimes
read
a
statutory
provision
with
a
deadline
like
this
as
creating
a
legally
enforceable
time
directive
but
as
not
requiring
the
judge
to
forfeit
the
power
to
act,
if
the
time
deadline
is
missed.
we
have
held
for
example
that
the
judge
who
misses
a
statutory
time
deadline
for
holding
a
bail
hearing,
can
still
hold
that
hearing
and
deny
bail
even
at
a
later
date.
we
here
hold
that
the
deadline
before
us
is
that
kind
of
a
deadline.
missing
the
deadline
does
not
deprive
the
sentencing
judge
of
the
power
to
order
restitution.
one
important
factor
that
convinces
us
is
that
immediately
following
the
words
not
to
exceed
90
days
after
sentencing,
the
statute
specifies
that
a
victim,
who
subsequently
discovers
further
losses,
can
still
seek
restitution,
no
matter
when
he
discovers
those
losses.
it
would
be
an
anomalous
for
a
single
provision
to
grant
a
right
to
recover
restitution
to
a
victim
who
does
not
discover
the
harm
until
say
one
year
or
five
years
or
20
years
has
passed,
but
deny
that
same
right
to
a
victim
who
cannot
ascertain
the
precise
amount
of
his
harm
for
more
than
90
days
and
it
would
be
particularly
anomalous
to
read
this
statute
that
way
since
the
basic
aim
of
this
statute
is
to
secure
mandatory
restitution,
to
crime
victims.
we
discuss
these
reasons
and
others
at
greater
length
in
our
opinion.
the
defendant
here
did
not
try
to
show
that
the
delay
prejudice
came
in
anyway
and
we
consequently
do
not
consider
how
such
prejudice
could
be
taken
into
account,
nor
do
we
consider
the
complicated
question
of
when
a
defendant
can
or
must
appeal
a
matter
that
affects
not
only
restitution
but
also
other
kinds
of
sentencing.
we
leave
all
such
matters
to
another
day.
chief
justice
roberts
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
scalia
and
kennedy
have
joined.
