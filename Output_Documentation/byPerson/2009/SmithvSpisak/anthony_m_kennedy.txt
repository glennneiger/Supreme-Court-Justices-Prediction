well,
if
--
if
the
strategy
that
mr.
cordray
and
justice
breyer
and,
to
some
extent,
justice
scalia
have
outlined
is
a
correct
strategy,
would
you
go
on
to
say
that
the
implementation
of
that
strategy
was
substandard?
it's
rambling,
you
have
to
--
in
order
to
get
mr.
cordray's
very
succinct
explanation,
you
have
to
go
through
a
couple
of
pages
and
drift
it
out,
as
justice
sotomayor
said,
his
argument
was
fine,
and
justice
breyer
--
but
that
is
not
the
argument
we
have.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
is
the
case
that
you
have
--
the
best
case
that
you
have,
maybe
a
case
in
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
state
supreme
courts,
where
it
is
said
that
the
implementation
of
the
strategy
was
just
inept
--
totally
inept.
i
mean,
is
that
what
your
argument
is
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
that
depends
on,
oh,
tone
of
voice,
the
ambiance
of
the
courtroom.
this
--
this
is
very
hard
for
us
--
you
know,
he
was
trying
to
be
folksy
with
the
jury,
obviously.
these
are
things
that
are
very
difficult
for
us
to
assess.
