sotomayor
why?
i
--
i
have
been
trying
to
figure
out
why
the
state
court
would
know
in
its
decisionmaking
that
mills
commanded
a
different
result
when
mills
was
issued
after
the
state
denied
its
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
finality
in
that
sense
is
generally
looked
at
in
terms
of
aedpa
statute
of
limitations.
why
should
the
same
rule
apply
to
the
question
of
whether
a
state
has
acted
contrary
to
or
unreasonably
in
light
of
supreme
court
precedent
when
the
precedent
didn't
exist
at
the
time
it
was
rendering
its
decision?
how
can
a
court
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
don't
have
to
go
any
further
if
we
simply
address
the
question,
at
what
point
in
time
are
we
talking
about
a
state
court's
decision,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
your
adversary's
position
--
i'm
sure
they
will
speak
for
themselves,
but
their
position
would
be
that
this
is
a
step
further
than
jones
or
other
cases
because
if
in
fact
--
what
you
are
tilling
us
is
that
if
the
jury
hangs,
the
court
will
have
to
impose
a
life
sentence
or
some
form
of
it.
but
the
jury
could
believe
that
they
could
--
that
it's
either
death
or
life,
and
one
holdout
juror
would
say:
well,
i
don't
want
to
let
this
guy
out;
because
those
are
the
only
two
choices
and
11
people
want
to
go
for
dead
--
death
and
i'm
the
only
holdout,
i
have
to
vote
for
death
to
make
sure
that
he
is
restrained
in
a
way
that
i
find
acceptable.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
are
two
extremes.
one
is
no
defense
whatsoever,
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
the
attorney
just
comes
in
and
says,
kill
him,
okay?
and
then
there
is
another,
which
is
your
very
eloquent
explanation
of
this
attorney's
strategy.
if
he
had
done
what
you
did
here,
we
may
not
be
having
this
appeal.
but
at
some
point
you
can
have
a
strategy
and
execute
it
so
poorly,
so
incompetently,
that
you're
providing
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
you
are
not
accepting
that
that
can
occur,
you
are
saying
the
minute
an
attorney
says,
i
had
a
strategy,
that
that
is
effective
counsel,
regardless
of
how
that
attorney
executed
that
strategy.
that
appears
to
be
your
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
he
actually
did
say
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but,
pretty
much,
he
said,
no
one's
going
to
fault
you
if
you
impose
the
death
sentence.
