mr.
michael
j.
benza
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sixth
circuit
evaluated
performance
of
trial
counsel
in
this
case
and
found
deficient
performance
for
three
primary
areas.
first,
counsel
presented
and
argued
to
the
jury
nonstatutory
aggravating
factors
as
reasons
to
impose
the
death
sentence
on
mr.
spisak.
in
ohio,
the
jury
is
allowed
to
consider
only
the
statutory
aggravator
factors,
not
nonstatutory
factors.
the
counsel
specifically
identified
and
argued
four
reasons
to
execute
mr.
spisak.
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
the
jury
what
was
not
mitigating
evidence
in
this
case,
including
factors
that
have
long
been
accepted
as
mitigating
factors
like
performance
in
prison,
adaptive
skills
and
the
issue
regarding
his
family
upbringing
and
childhood.
finally,
the
lawyer
turned
to
what
he
argued
was
the
only
mitigating
evidence
that
they
were
going
to
be
arguing,
and
that
was
the
issue
of
the
client's
mental
health.
he
then--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
because
it
is
directly
related
to
the
mental
health
evidence.
had
the
lawyer
identified
the
testimony
of
the
mental
health
experts,
including
dr.
resnick,
who
is
the
court
clinic
psychiatrist,
who
testified
that
while
he
has
been
incarcerated
and
receiving
treatment
his
performance
and
his
mental
illness
has
resided
--
that
he
has
gotten
better.
and
that
he
is
not--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--that
is
correct,
it
did.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
if
the
--
if
the
lawyer
had
identified
for
the
jury
the
testimony
of
the
mental
health
experts,
that
would
have
been
the
case.
this
court
recognized--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--yes.
dr.
resnick
testified--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--during
the
trial,
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that
his
performance--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--well,
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
that's
what
the
experts
testified
to.
and
this
was
the
court
clinic
expert
who
was
testifying,
who
evaluated
him
for
the
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
if
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
that,
that
would
be
correct.
the
problem
that
this
case
presents
--
and
this
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
found
--
that
had
the
lawyer
then
said,
yes,
for
all
of
these
reasons
they
may
weigh
in
favor
of
death,
but
here
are
the
reasons
why
you
should
consider
life,
we
would
have
a
very
case
than
we
have
here
today.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
no.
and
that's
because
this
case
is
such
an
outlier.
i
have
been
litigating
capital
cases
since
1993.
i
have
never
seen
a
closing
argument
like
this.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
he
--
what
he
should
have
done
is
what
this
court
recognized
in
penry
v.
lynaugh,
is
that
mental
health
evidence
is
a
double-edged
sword.
the
job
of
the
defense
lawyer
is
to
explain
why
the
mental
health
evidence
mitigates
the
crimes--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--well,
we
actually
don't
know
what
the
state
court
said
about--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--for
whatever
reason
we
had
the
state
court
decision
that
affirmed
this.
we
have
no
idea
why.
the
issue
is,
however,
once
the
lawyer
decided
that
this
was
the
mitigation
strategy
that
he
was
going
to
present,
this
was
the
evidence
that
he
had
available
to
argue
to
him,
it
is
the
role
of
the
defense
counsel
to
advocate.
so
once
the
lawyer
makes
the
strategic
decision,
i
am
going
to
present
the
closing
argument
focused
--
based
on
mental
health
mitigating
evidence,
then
the
lawyer's
job
is
to
stand
up
and
explain
to
the--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--as
the
amici
points
out,
there
is
no
strategic
reason
for
this
closing.
the
amici
for
petitioner
--
or
for
respondent
has
identified
that
there
can
be
no
strategic
reason
to
have
provided
this
closing
argument.
by
any
evaluation
of
the
skill
of
closing
argument
this
was
deficient.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
no.
spisak
is
the
only
one
like
that.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
if
that's
your
conclusion,
then
we
--
we
don't
point
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
i
beg
to
differ--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--that
is
correct.
the
lawyer
didn't--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--yes,
that
the
application,
that
the
way
the
lawyer
delivered
the
closing,
the
themes
that
he
identified,
the
things
that
he
said,
was
the
deficiency--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--they
are
very
difficult,
but
this
case
doesn't
present
those
nuances.
this
case
presents
the
case
where
the
lawyer
stands
up
at
closing
argument
--
and
the
only
thing
he
didn't
say
that
could
have
made
this
worse
was
justice
stevens
hypothetical
of
it's
fine
by
me
if
you
actually
execute
him.
it's
the
only
thing
he
didn't
say
in
his
closing
that
could
have
possibly
made
it
worse
for
the
client.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
not
in
those
words.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
and
we
will
be
proud
of
you,
whichever
you
do.
only
those
very
words,
i
would
like
you
to
execute
him
as
well,
did
not
escape
his
lips.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
but
that's
what
we
do
under
strickland.
the
court
recognizes,
in
strickland
analysis,
that
there
are
multiple
ways
that
various
lawyers
will
try
the
same
case;
all
of
which
can
be
effective.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
yes,
but
this
court
has
already
recognized
that
the
sixth
amendment
applies,
the
right
to
counsel
applies
at
closing
argument.
in
yarborough
v.
gentry,
at
page
5
of
this
court's
opinion,
the
court
specifically
stated
that
the
right
to
effective
assistance
extends
to
closing
argument.
so
this
is
not
a
redevelopment
or
an
expansion
of
strickland.
it's
simply
an
application
of
the
strickland
analysis,
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
before
the--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--that's
--
that's
correct,
and
that's
the
theme
that
defense
counsel
said
he
was
going
to
implement
at
the
closing.
what
--
the
failure
of
the
lawyer
was
to
adequately
and
effectively
make
that
closing
to
the
jury.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
well,
it
--
first,
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
lower
court
found
it
adequate,
we
have
no
idea,
again,
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
determined
as
to
question
of
deficient
performances
or
to
prejudice
or
to
strategy.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
there
were
67
assignments
of
error
raised
to
the
ohio
supreme
court.
this
is
the
only
case
on
direct
appeal,
where
the
ohio
supreme
court
issued
a
procuring
of.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
they
did
cite
strickland,
along
with
49
other
claims.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
they
dismissed
this
claim
and--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--we
have
no
idea
whether
they
decided
that
there
was
deficient
performance,
but
no
prejudice
--
that
there
was,
in
fact,
deficient
performance,
but
no
prejudice,
that
this
was
not
deficient
because
it
was
reasonable
strategy.
it
is
also
possible
that
the
lower
courts
were
misapplying,
as
this
court
recognized
in
michael
williams'
case,
that--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
j.
benza
unless
we--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--if
we
assume
that
they
were
then
applying
the
lockhart
v.
fretwell
standard
as
to
the
question
of
prejudice,
then
it
would
clearly
be
contrary
to
strickland,
to
have
applied
that
standard
of
review
for
prejudice.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
well,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
supreme
court
actually
did.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that
is.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that
is
the
rule
on
direct
appeal.
it
is
also
the
implication
of
applying
aedpa.
the
problem
that
you
have
in
that
is,
when
you
try
to
apply
aedpa
to
this
particular
claim,
you
don't
know
how
the
state
court,
in
fact,
decided
this
case.
and,
therefore,
you
don't
know
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
give
the
aedpa
deference
to
the
decision
that
there
was
no
deficient
performance,
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
i
would
think,
no,
that
you
don't
send
it
back,
but
what
happens--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--i
would
--
i
think
the
issue
then
would
become
that,
when
a
state
court
chooses
to
summarily
deny,
without
evaluation,
an
explanation
of
the
merits
of
the
claim,
that,
when
it
comes
to
habeas
review,
the
constraints
of
aedpa
are
lifted.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
not
insulate
from
overturning,
but
to
gain
the
benefit
of
2254(d)'s
restrictive
reviews
of
habeas.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
if,
in
fact,
it
is
not
contrary
to
our
unreasonable
application,
it
would
be
insulated
or--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
no,
this
court
has
never
addressed
how
to
apply
2254(d)
to
a
summary
decision.
in
knowles
v.
mirzayance,
the
court
noted
that
this
was
in
fact
an
issue
and
reserved
that
for
another
day.
in
early
v.
packer,
this
court
recognized,
though,
however,
that
aedpa
constraints
are
looking
at
not
just
at
the
outcome
of
the
lower
court's
--
the
state
court's
decisions,
but
the
reasoning
behind
it,
because
if
you
are
going
to
have
an
unreasonable
application
of
--
of
a
binding
law
from
this
court,
the
lower
courts
have
to
be
able
to
apply
it
and
explain,
how
did
we
apply
it?
otherwise
every
decision
of
the
state
court
would
be
insulated
from
federal
habeas
review,
making
the
writ
available
but
unavailable.
because
no
decision
would
therefore
ever
be
unreasonable
if
the
standard
is
for
a
district
court
judge
to
say:
can
i
imagine
a
reasonable
way
for
the
state
court
to
have
reached
this
result?
i
have;
i'm
a
reasonable
judge;
the
state
court
must
have
done
what
i
have
done;
therefore,
the
review
is
limited,
and
the
writ
--
and
the
writ
is
denied.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
it
would
review
--
it
would
revert
to
pre-aedpa
habeas
review
to
the
standards,
and
with
review
of
the
state
court
decision
but
with
de
novo
application
in
the--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--i
would
submit
it
is
impossible.
if
the--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--i
would
--
i
would
beg
to
differ.
i
would
think
that
if
the
summary
disposition
is
going
to
be
held
to
that
standard
of
an
unreasonable
application
where
we
have
no
indication
of
how
the
state
courts
actually
applied
the
law,
it
would
have
to
be
the
extreme
outlier
that
would
demonstrate
that
that
was
an
unreasonable--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--it
--
it
does
not
require
a
revision.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
it
simply
requires
the
court
to
say
that
when
you
have
summary
disposition,
that
when
evaluating
the
state
claim,
the
state
court
decision
is
given
the
deference
that
it
is
due,
and
that
is
that
we
simply
cannot
determine
whether
or
not
it
properly
applied
federal
law,
and
therefore,
it
does
not
get
the
safe
harbor
of
aedpa
evaluation.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
the
court
does
that
when
it
reviews
those
quarters
constrained
by
what
actually
happened
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
and
that
is--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--and
that
would
be
the
evaluation
that
would
continue
on
in
habeas
review
of
these
claims,
is
evaluating
the
state
court
decision
without,
though,
simply
saying,
well,
we're
going
to
--
and
this
is
what
happens
in
the
lower
courts.
when
you
have
these
summary
decisions
in
2254(d)
analysis,
those
circuits
that
have
applied
this
say,
what
we
will
imagine
a
way
in
which
the
state
court
could
have
reasonably
applied
this
law
to
reach
this
result,
and
therefore,
since
that
is
a
reasonable
way,
because
of
course
we
as
article
3
judges
have
reasonably
come
up
with
that,
it
must
be
reasonable,
it's
not
an
unreasonable
application,
and
the
writ
is
denied.
the
problem
that
we
face
is
when
you
look
at
that
in
comparison
to
cases
like
wiggins
and
rompilla
where
the
state
courts
affirmatively
denied
applying
federal
standards,
you
get
a
different
level
of
review.
and
so
you
end
up
encouraging
state
courts
in
these
types
of
cases
to
simply
issue
postcard
denials:
appeal
denied.
federal
courts,
you
figure
it
out.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--i
think
aedpa
was
designed
that
when
the
state
courts,
in
fact,
are
doing
their
jobs
under
the
constitution
to
protect
defendants'
rights
to
review
their
claim,
then
they
should
receive
the
protections
of
aedpa.
what
that
means
for
deferential
review--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--it
does.
and
as
this
court
has
explained,
what
happens
in
habeas
is
that
the
federal,
the
district
courts
and
the
circuit
courts
have
to
evaluate
the
claim
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
an
unreasonable
application.
it
still
falls
to
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
to--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that's
the
other
alternative
is
that
then
the
statute
doesn't
apply,
which
as
this
court
has
recognized,
when
it
comes
to
applying
aedpa,
the
side
that
is
left
untouched
regarding
that
is
the
issue
of
the
suspension
of
the
writ.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
it's
still
the
same
standard.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
the
standards
provided
for
in
aedpa
are
there
to
protect
the
state
court
judgments
when
they
have
done
their
job,
when
they
explained
their
rationale
and
applied
the
federal
law.
if
you
see
these
postcard
denials--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--if
i
may,
if
i'm
turning
--
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
effect,
i
will
turn
to
the
mills
issue.
the
--
the
question
in
front
of
the
sixth
circuit
was
whether
or
not
the
totality
of
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case
were
such
that
they
violated
mills'
directive
that
an
individual
jurist's
determination
of
a
mitigating
factor's
existence
could
not
be
precluded
from
being
considered
by
the
injection
of
that
--
of
those
factors
by
the
other
11
jurors.
what
you
have
in
this
particular
case
is
the
totality
of
the
jury
instructions
were
such
that
a
reasonable
understanding
of
the
instruction
was
that
the
jury
had
to
be
unanimous
as
to
the
understanding
and
the
existence
of
a
mitigating
factor
before
it
could
even
be
considered.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
in
terry
williams
v.
taylor,
this
court
recognized
in
the
opinion
authored
by
justice
o'connor
that
the
issue
for
contrary
to
or
unreasonable
application
is
going
to
be
governed
by
the
application
of
teague.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
as
to
the
application
of
mills?
or--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--no,
this
court
has
maintained
that
the
issue
regarding
the
application
of
--
of
controlling
established
--
what
--
clearly
established
law
by
this
court
is
going
to
be
determined
by
teague,
and
teague
determines
that
mills
v.
maryland
decision
applies
to
this
claim.
in
--
it
was
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
state
court.
now
there
is
another
--
underlying
this
is
another
aedpa
concern,
is
how
does
the
federal
--
or
the
state
court
adjudicate
the
constitutional
claim
since
mills
had
not
been
presented.
it
decided
the
merits
of
the
claim
were
--
were
to
be
rejected
but
it
did
not
decide
the
case
under
mills
v.
maryland
because
of
course
mills
had
not
been
decided
and
we
know
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
banks
case
that
mills
was
a
new
law.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that
this
court
has
said,
but
this
court
has
also
said
that
the
decision
to
that
question
is
based
on
the
decision
of
teague.
if
a
case
applies
to
the
court
based
on
teague,
then
it
will
apply
to
the
merits
of
this
particular
claim.
and
what
the
circuit
found--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--this
court
has
held
that
the
decision
of
whether
a
--
when
a
case
is
going
to
be
clearly
established
for
review
in
habeas
is
going
to
be
based
on
teague.
that
was
the
opinion
by
justice
o'connor
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
terry
williams,
that
the
decision
for
clearly
established
is
going
to
be
based
on
the
decision
of
the
applicability
of
teague.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
teague
says
that
the
decision
for
application
of
a
newly
established
law
or
a
new
established
constitutional
rule
is
predicated
on
the
denial
of
direct
appeal,
which
in
this
case
would
be
the
cert
denied
by
this
court
of
the
direct
appeal
of
the
case,
which
happened
in
1989,
a
year
after
the
decision
in
mills
was
handed
down.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
because
in
--
in
our
case
every
jury
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
told
them
that
they
had
to
be
unanimous,
including
the
specific
instruction--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--actually
they
--
they
were
told
that,
because
they
were
also
told
that
that
included
their
decisions
as
to
all
disputes
of
fact.
the
existence
of
a
mitigating
factor
is
of
course
a
question
of
fact.
so
the
jury
was
in
fact
specifically
instructed
to
be
unanimous
to
every
decision
that
they
made
including
resolving
disputes
of
fact.
they
were
told
by
both
lawyers
for
the
defense
and
lawyers
for
the
prosecution
that
the
first
question
they
had
to
answer
when
they
got
into
the
jury
room
was
to
the
existence
of
mitigating
factors.
if
they
--
if
they
reasonably
understood
that
they
had
to
be
unanimous
as
to
that
fact
they
would
have
rejected
the
mitigating
factors,
even
if
11
of
them
had
agreed
that
the
mental
health
evidence
in
this
case
was
a
mitigating
factor.
and
when--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--that's
correct,
as
to
that
instruction.
but
the
existence
of
the
mitigator
was
the
predicate
question
that
the
jury
would
have
to
answer
and
our
position
is
that
they
also
would
have
had
to
be
unanimous
per
the
instruction.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
they
appear
at
--
let's
see.
just
a
moment--
mr.
michael
j.
benza
--it
is
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
and
i've
lost
my
appendix
cite
to
it
but
the
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
it's
at
petition

326:
it
is
your
duty
to
carefully
weigh
the
evidence,
to
decide
all
disputed
questions
of
fact,
to
apply
the
instructions
of
court
to
your
findings
and
to
render
your
verdict
accordingly.

mr.

there

that

a

that

mr.
michael
j.
benza
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
yes,
that
then
would
violate
mills.
that's
the
error
in
this
instruction.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
that's
the
question
in
mills.
mr.
michael
j.
benza
when
considered
in
totality,
yes.
