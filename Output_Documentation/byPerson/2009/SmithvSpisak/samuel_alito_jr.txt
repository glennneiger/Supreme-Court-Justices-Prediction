justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
have
you
ever
heard
or
read
a
defense
summation
that
was
more
derogatory
of
the
defendant
than
the
summation
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
defense
counsel--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--goes
so
far
as
to
say:
don't
look
to
him
for
sympathy
because
he
demands
none.
but
isn't
that
exactly
what
he
has
to
appeal
for
in
order
not
to
get
a
death
verdict,
sympathy
based
on
--
on
mental
illness,
despite
the
horrific
crimes
that
this
person
committed
and
the
things
that
he
said
on
the
stand.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
assumes
that
the
state
courts
are
--
what
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
all
the
other
state
supreme
courts
are
doing
is
waiving
briefs
for
federal
habeas
courts.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that's
what
aedpa
was
intended
to
do?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
first
question
that
justice
sotomayor
asked?
half
of
you
say
that
--
that
the
state
court's
decision
was
contrary
to
or
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly-established
federal
laws
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
i.e.,
mills
v.
maryland,
when
mills
v.
maryland
hadn't
been
decided.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
are
there
--
are
there
not
quite
a
few
instances
of
contrary
statements
in
our
opinions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
time
when
the
--
the
law
has
to
be
clearly
established
by
a
decision
in
that
court.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
court
has
not
said
that
clearly
established
federal
law
refers
to
this
court's
decision
as
of
the
time
of
the
relevant
state
court
decision.
