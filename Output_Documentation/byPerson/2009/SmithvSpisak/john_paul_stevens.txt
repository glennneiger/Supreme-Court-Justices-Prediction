justice
john
paul
stevens
general
cordray,
may
i
--
may
i
--
you
are
basically
arguing
that
he
was
not--
not
deficient
in
performance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
i
am
persuaded
that
there
was
deficient
performance,
for
all
the
reasons
your
adversary
argues,
and
i
am
focusing
on
the
prejudice
issue.
i
think
you
make
a
very
strong
argument
that
this
guy
would
have
gotten
the
death
penalty
anyway.
but
what
if
--
what
if
the
deficiency
had
been
even
worse?
supposing
the
defense
counsel
had
got
up
and
said:
i
wish
i
could
make
an
argument,
but
i
really
think
you
ought
to
give
him
the
death
penalty
--
just
outrageously
sided
with
the
prosecutor.
would
that
mean
that
we
could
still
find
no
prejudice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
--
i
understand
that.
but
--
so
you
really
are
saying
the
question
is
whether
cronic
or
strickland
controls?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
your
argument
really
depend
on
any
deference
to
the
state
supreme
court?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is
just
sort
of
as
a
fresh
matter
there
wasn't
prejudice
here.
and
--
and
isn't
it
also
true
that
we
really
don't
know
what
the
ohio
supreme
court's
basis
for
its
decision
was,
whether
not
competent,
incompetence,
or
lack
of
prejudice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
don't
know
which
prong
of
strickland
it
relied
on,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you'd
say
a
state
supreme
court
is
entitled
to
more
deference
if
it
doesn't
tell
us
the
basis
for
its
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
rule
on
direct
appeal,
of
course,
not
on
collateral.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
we
just
go
back
to
that
one
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
your
deference
be
exactly
the
same
if,
instead
of
listing
all
47
claims
or
so,
they
simply
entered
a
one-line
order
saying,
"affirmed"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
--
let
me
go
back
to
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
are
entitled
to
more
deference
because
they
did
cite
strickland
if
they
--
than
if
they
did
cite
nothing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
deference
whether
they
say
it's
strickland
or
not.
