chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-724,
smith
v.
spisak.
general
cordray.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
benza.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
--
you
fault
him
for
not
talking
about
performance
in
prison,
prospective
performance
in
prison?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
look
like
that's
going
to
be
a
very
strong
argument.
i
mean,
he
is
still
talking
about
people
he
wants
to
kill,
and
you
are
going
to
get
up
there
and
say
he
might
perform
well
in
prison?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
is
on
the
stand
with
a
hitler
moustache
testifying
about
what
a
great
job
he
did
killing
these
people,
and
he
says
he
is
going
to
do
it
again.
i
think
--
didn't
the
letter
identify
particular
people
he
wanted
to
kill?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
jury
is
supposed
to
believe
that
this
guy
is
going
to
do
well
in
prison?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
guess
it
gets
back
to
the
--
the
point,
we
are
talking
about
what
a
jury
would
think
and
isn't
it
possible.
you
are
suggesting,
i
think,
he
--
he
should
grasp
any
straws
that
are
there,
this
might
help.
but
isn't
it
possible
that
that
would
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
jury?
in
other
words,
they
see
this
lawyer
telling
them
this
guy
is
going
to
do
well
in
prison
and
the
lawyer's
credibility
is
--
is
shot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
imposing
a
strategic
rule,
and
the
counsel
obviously
made
a
decision
--
or
the
record
may
reflect
that
the
type
of
advocacy
that
you
are
telling
us
he
has
to
have.
here's
why
you
should
give
this
guy
sympathy.
here's
why.
here's
--
he's
a
good
guy.
i
mean,
there
is
--
even
standing
at
that
podium,
there
is
a
different
strategy
that
people
sometimes
employ,
which
is
sort
of
the
understated
--
you
know,
well,
he
did
some
terrible
things,
don't
--
i'm
not
asking
for
sympathy
for
these
things,
but
--
you
know,
we
are
very
proud
of
the
fact
that
we
don't
execute
--
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
disagreement
is
over
different
styles
of
advocacy.
and
i
don't
know
how
to
--
particularly
in
a
case
where
you
don't
have
much
to
work
with,
i
don't
know
how
to
make
a
judgment
that
his
choice
was
worse
than
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you're
--
if
you're
right
about
that
issue
on
which
we
haven't
had
a
decision
yet,
then
we
would
look
at
prejudice
on
our
own,
without
deference
to
the
state
court
findings?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
mills
opinion
has
one
of
those
concluding
paragraphs
at
the
end
that
sort
of
sums
everything
up,
and
it
says
that
we
conclude
there
is
a
substantial
probability
that
reasonable
jurors
upon
receiving
the
judge's
instructions
in
this
case
and
in
attempting
to
complete
the
verdict
form
as
instructed
may
have
thought
they
were
precluded
from
considering
any
mitigating
evidence
unless
all
12
jurors
agreed
on
the
existence
of
a
particular
such
circumstance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
how
is
that
clearly
established
law
that
your
claim
is
--
is
contrary
to
mills?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
on
death
or
nondeath,
not
on
whether
a
particular
mitigating
circumstance
exists.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
does
that
say
what
your
summary
was
earlier,
that
they--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--can't
consider
a
mitigating
circumstance
unless
they
unanimously
agree
about
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
every
court
tell
them
it's
their
duty
to
decide
disputed
questions
of
fact?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
think
that
includes
within
it
the
idea
that
they
--
they
cannot
consider
a
mitigating
circumstance
unless
they
all
12
agree
on
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
i
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
have
got
your
mills
argument.
it
is
that
the
sentence
that
says
"it's
your
duty
to
did
decide
all
disputed
questions
of
fact
is
the
same
as
saying
they
are
instructed
that
they
cannot
consider
a
mitigating
circumstance
unless
they
are
unanimous?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cordray,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
an
argument
you
made
before
this
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
an
argument
that
you've
made
before
this
court
in
your
brief,
that
we
shouldn't
consider
whether
mills
is
the
controlling
standard
because
mills
came
after?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
is
your
answer
to
your
friend's
explanation
that
it's
hard
to
defer
when
they
don't
even
say
anything?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
cordray;
mr.
benza.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
08724,
smith
versus
the
spisak.
