mr.
richard
cordray
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
this
case
arises
under
the
deferential
standards
of
the
aedpa
statute,
mr.
spisak
must
show
that
the
ohio
supreme
court's
decision
was
contrary
to
mills
v.
maryland
or
that
it
unreasonably
applied
strickland
v.
washington.
mr.
richard
cordray
it's
a
bit
of
a
conundrum,
your
honor,
because
mills
was
issued
after
the
ohio
supreme
court's
decision
here,
but
before
it
became
final
on
direct
review
when
cert
was
denied
by
this
court
in
march
of
1989.
mr.
richard
cordray
i'm
perfectly
willing,
your
honor,
to
back
it
up
a
step
and
say
mills
was
not
clearly-established
law
at
the
time
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
decided,
although
the
issues
were
current
at
the
time.
but
i
would
go
further
and
say
the
extension
of
mills
that
the
sixth
circuit's
ruling
made
here
is
not
clearly-established
law
even
today,
more
than
20
years
later.
there
is
a
--
the
vast
majority
of
circuits,
fourth,
fifth,
seventh,
eighth,
tenth,
have
rejected
the
position
the
sixth
circuit
took
here,
and
in
fact,
this
case
is
quite
distinct
from
mills
even
if
mills
were
applicable.
but
i
would
take
your
point
and
i
would
agree
with
it
that
it's
kind
of
tough
to
impose
on
the
ohio
supreme
court
mills
when--
mr.
richard
cordray
--fair
enough.
fair
enough.
yes.
but
i
would
say
this
case
is
distinct
even
from
mills,
where
the
court
determined
that
the
jury
instructions
gave
the
jury
to
believe
that
they
could
only
consider
mitigating
factors
that
they
had
determined
unanimously
to
be
present.
and
in
this
case,
none
of
that
was
done.
the
verdict
form
was
quite
different,
and
in
fact
the
jury
was
only
instructed
to
be
unanimous
on
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
the
aggravators
outweighed
the
mitigators,
a
common
instruction
and
one
that's
upheld
around
the
country
consistently.
second--
mr.
richard
cordray
--even
at
the
time,
if
the
jury
effectively
hung--
mr.
richard
cordray
--on
that
question,
the
consequence
would
be
that
the
court
would
then
impose
some
version
of
a
life
sentence.
the
issue
is
whether
the
jury
was
required
to
be
instructed
that
at
the
time,
whether
they
were
required
to
be
instructed
something
that
might
push
them
away
from
unanimity.
this
court
has
never
so
held,
and
in
fact,
in
jones
v.
united
states
the
court
rejected
that
rule
in
a
ruling
that
was
not
dissented
to
by
anyone
on
the
panel.
your
dissent
in
that
case
at
footnote
20
took
no
issue
with
the
--
with
the
notion
that
the
jury
did
not
have
to
be
instructed
in
ways
that
would
push
them
away
from
rendering
unanimous
verdict
on
the
ultimate
question.
since
that
time,
as
a
matter
of
state
court
practice
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
state
v.
brooks
did
say:
we
are
now
going
to
add
that
instruction.
but
they
later
themselves
rejected
that
that
was
required
by
the
eighth
amendment
in
state
v.
davis,
and
that
also
has
been
the
consistent
holding
of
most
circuits,
that
that
is
not
required.
if
i
could
move--
mr.
richard
cordray
--i
believe
that's
the
case
at
the
time,
your
honor.
at
the
time,
the
instructions
pushed
the
jury
toward
unanimity
one
way
or
the
other.
do
the
aggravators
outweigh
the
mitigators
or
do
they
not?
since
that
time,
the
ohio
supreme
court
as
a
matter
of
practice
has
been
willing
to
go
further
and
instruct
the
jury,
or
have
the
jury
be
instructed,
that
if
a
single
one
of
you
feels
that
the
aggravators
do
not
outweigh
the
mitigators,
that
will
preclude
a
death
sentence.
but
that
has
never
been
constitutionally
required
by
this
court.
it
is
an
extension
of
mills
v.
maryland
that
has
never
been
so
held
by
this
court,
and
in
fact
is
a
source
of
a
--
of
a
significant
overwhelming
majority
of
circuits
the
opposite
way.
if
i
could
move
to
the--
mr.
richard
cordray
--this,
as
your
honor
notes
from
your
time
on
the
trial
court,
is
the
jury
dynamic
in
the
jury
room.
it
is
the
push
towards
unanimity.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
an
instruction
to
be
given
that
would
encourage
a
single
juror
to
hold
out
and
try
to
avoid
reaching
a
unanimous
verdict.
the
court
has
never
held
that
that
is
constitutionally
required,
and
if
they
did
so
hold
in
this
case
it
would
be
an
extension
that
is
a
new
rule
and
would
not
be
applicable
on
aedpa
review
here.
second,
on
the
ineffectiveness
claim,
mr.
spisak
loses
sight
of
the
fact
that
this
was
no
run-of-the-mill
trial.
his
crimes
were
among
the
most
infamous
in
ohio
history.
at
the
trial
he
groomed
himself
to
look
like
adolf
hitler,
and
on
the
stand
he
celebrated
his
victims'
deaths,
spewed
his
racist
beliefs,
and
pledged
to
continue
his
own
brand
of
personal
warfare
against
society.
in
the
sentencing
phase,
defense
counsel
reasonably
took
the
only
tack
available
to
him.
he
used
the
sheer
depravity
of
his
client's
crimes
and
his
disturbing
character
to
tell
a
story
about
his
client's
mental
illness,
and
he
asked
the
jury
to
forego
the
death
penalty
for
mr.
spisak
because
he
is
mentally
ill
and
thus,
under
the
mitigating
factor,
lacked
substantial
capacity
to
appreciate
or
conform
his
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
the
law.
mr.
richard
cordray
that
is
not
sufficient--
mr.
richard
cordray
--first
of
all,
i
would
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
the
closing.
it
was
not
a
perfect
closing,
but
it
had
three
identifiable
pieces
to
it.
the
first
was,
he
--
he
did
go
back
and
recapitulate
the
nature
of
the
crimes,
something
this
court
said
in
yarborough
is
an
acceptable
defense
strategy.
that's
the
elephant
in
the
room.
the
jury
heard
weeks
of
testimony
about
this
crime.
the
prosecutor
was
surely
going
to
highlight
that.
he
was
attempting
to
take
this
sting
out
and
identify
with
the
jury
that
he
understood
how
they
would
react
to
the
crimes.
the
second
piece
of
the
closing
--
this
is
at
petition
appendix,
approximately
339a
to
344a,
he
goes
into
the
mitigating
factor
of
mental
illness.
he
had
presented
three
mental
health
experts
in
the
sentencing
phase
to
demonstrate
that
his
client
was
mentally
ill.
he
had
made
a
continued
argument
that
there
was
a
larger
jar
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
fulfill,
even
though
he
had
tried
at
trial,
and
that
evidence
had
ultimately
been
struck
by
the
trial
court,
which
found
they
have
not
made
out
a
defense
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
but
he
pursued
the
same
theme
here
in
sentencing,
presenting
evidence
and
saying:
we
have
at
least
fulfilled
the
smaller
jar
of
mental
illness,
diminished
capacity
to
intend,
and
because
we
are
a
humane
society
our
general
assembly
has
made
that
a
mitigating
factor
that
you
should
apply
here,
and
you
should
not
execute
someone
who
has
a
diminished
ability
to
intend.
mr.
richard
cordray
that's
right.
mr.
richard
cordray
i
think
in
cronic
the
court
said
that
if
there
is
effectively
a
structural
breakdown
--
i
mean,
if
in
fact
counsel
had
gotten
up
and
argued
solely
a
prosecution
argument
and
not
pivoted
at
all
to
mitigating
circumstances,
perhaps
it
would
be
possible
to
presume
prejudice
in
that
situation.
that's
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
cordray
that's
one
of
the
questions.
mr.
richard
cordray
although
in
our
cert
petition
question
2,
we
also
argue
that
the
sixth
circuit
erred
by
not
deferring
to
the
ohio
supreme
court's
application
of
strickland
v.
washington.
and
on
the
prejudice
issue,
this
is
landrigan.
that
is
the
case
this
court
decided
and
then
granted,
vacated
and
remanded
this
case
back
to
the
sixth
circuit.
if
you
look
at
the
prejudice
discussion
in
landrigan
--
and
i
would
direct
attention
to
the
quote
near
the
end
where
the
court
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
panel
got
it
right,
and
what
they
said
was
that
the
--
the
testimony
was
chilling.
the
person
in
landrigan
had
repeated
--
had
committed
repeated
murders
and
tried
to
kill
again
and
again.
the
same
with
spisak
in
this
case.
he
had
been
unrepentant
in
the
court
and
in
fact
had
flaunted
his
menacing
behavior,
just
as
spisak
went
on
for
days
on
the
stand
expressing
his
white
power
views
and
how
he
would
continue
to
war
if
he
had
the
opportunity,
if
given
the
chance.
in
landrigan
this
court
approved
the
court
of
appeals
statement
in
the
end
that
any
further,
minor
mitigating
evidence
that
could
have
been
presented
in
the
wake
of
that
record
could
not
have
been
helpful;
there
is
no
prejudice.
that
prejudice
holding
in
landrigan
i
believe
controls
this
case.
in
fact,
this
case
may
be
even
a
stronger
case
than
landrigan
for
no
prejudice.
mr.
richard
cordray
i
would
say
three
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
would
agree
with
yarborough,
where
this
court
said
that
the
--
the
determination
about
deficiency
and
prejudice
is
doubly
deferential
through
the
aedpa
lens.
we
would
defer,
as
yarborough
said,
to
reasonable
tactical
decisions
made
in
closing
argument,
but
we
would
be
doubly
deferential
under
aedpa
because
we
have
to
hold
that
the
ohio
supreme
court's
rejection
of
the
ineffectiveness
claim
was
itself
objectively
an
unreasonable
application
of
strickland.
so
that's
one.
number
two,
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
reject
this
claim.
it
cited
strickland
v.
washington.
it
did
not
go
on
in
detail.
mr.
richard
cordray
we
don't.
but
this
is
not
a
case
like
rompilla,
where
the
--
where
the
court
was
faced
with
a
court
that
had
held
only
on
one
prong
and
had
disclaimed
any
attempt
to
review
under
the
other
prong.
if
the
court
simply
gives
a
summary
affirmance
or
summary
disposition
and
doesn't
specify
which
prong,
i
think
the
court
has
to
give
deference
under
both
prongs,
because
the
alternative
would
be
to
give
deference
under
neither
prong,
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
--
the
aedpa
statement
that
we
have
to
did
defer
to
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
by
a
state
court.
and
so
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
fair
here.
but
i
certainly
think--
mr.
richard
cordray
--it
--
it
may
seem
a
little
odd,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
cordray
if
they
disclaim
a
prong,
then
i
think
it's
de
novo
review,
and
rompilla
did
say
that.
if
they
don't
disclaim
a
prong,
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
defer
because
the
alternative
is
it
gives
no
deference
to
summary
dispositions,
and
--
and
that
has
been
the
general
tenor
of
courts
under
aedpa,
is
if
there
is
a
question
you
err
on
the
side
of
giving
deference.
that
clearly
was
congress's
intent
in
enacting
that
statute.
mr.
richard
cordray
we,
of
course,
your
honor,
don't
have
subjective
testimony
from
the
counsel
as
to
what
his
strategy
was.
but
i
think
it's
quite
apparent
from
the
record.
he
at
trial
attempted
to
establish
a
defense
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
he
was
set
back,
he
and
his
trial
team,
because
in
the
end
the
trial
judge
rejected
that
defense
and
struck
that
testimony.
he
renewed
his
effort
at
the
sentencing
phase
by
bringing
several
mental
health
experts
and
having
them
testify
on
the
stand
to
show
that
at
least
they
had
met
the
lower
standard
of
mental
disease
or
defect
under
the
ohio
revised
code.
he
then
argued,
perhaps
not
as
eloquently
as
--
as
one
might,
you
know,
as
--
as
justice
jackson
once
said,
you
know,
in
their
bed
that
night,
but
he
argued
about:
yes,
these
crimes
were
brutal.
he
went
on
at
some
length
about
that.
but
these
crimes
were
brutal
and
the
jury
had
heard
all
that
and
clearly
had
that
in
their
minds.
he
then
pivoted
to
five
pages
of
closing
arguments,
in
addition
to
days
of
presentation
on
the
subject,
to
say:
we
have
shown
at
least
mental
illness;
it
is
a
mitigating
factor;
the
general
assembly
made
it
a
mitigating
factor
and
we
as
a
humane
people
should
be
proud
that
we
do
not
execute
someone
who
has
substantial
deficiency
in
ability
to
intend.
he
then
went
on
to
handle
some
rebuttal
points
that
he
was
--
he
was
feeling
the
heat
on
from
the
prosecutor's
presentation.
for
example,
that
he
had
not
necessarily
met
with
these
experts
before
they
came
and
testified
at
trial;
that
he
had
perhaps
shopped
for
experts
and
other
matters
of
that
sort;
that
maybe
the
--
the
jury
was
going
to
hold
against
him
and
his
defense
team
their
deficiency
as
counsel,
because
they
had
made
this
effort
to
get
not
a
--
a
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
plea
and
the
judge
had
knocked
that
out.
mr.
richard
cordray
i
have
not
read
a
great
number
of
defense
summations,
but
this
was
derogatory.
but
frankly,
the
bed
that
was
made
was
made
by
his
client,
who
got
on
the
stand
for
days
on
end
and
spewed
his
racist
propaganda,
made
it
clear
that
he
was
not
only
unrepentant
but
was
triumphant;
that
one
or
more
of
his
murders
were
slick,
pretty
neat;
that
he
celebrated
the
killings;
that
he
went
out
to
kill
again,
that
if
he
had
the
opportunity
now
he
would
again
go
out
to
kill
again.
mr.
richard
cordray
that's
the
context.
mr.
richard
cordray
no,
your
honor.
and
i
think
again
counsel
in
the
context
of
this
proceeding
judged,
perhaps
rightly,
that
it
was
very
unlikely
this
jury
was
going
to
have
sympathy
for
his
client.
instead
he
appealed
to
the
jury's
own
sense
of
humanity
and
pride:
we
have
this
mitigating
factor
under
the
law,
we
are
a
civilized
people,
we
do
not
execute
people
who
have
substantial
diminished
ability
to
intend;
and
i
appeal
to
you,
you
jury,
even
though
i
can
sense
that
you
are
not
feeling
sympathy
for
my
client,
do
what
--
what
makes
you
a
humane
people,
what
makes
us
proud
as
a
people,
and
do
not
give
the
death
penalty
to
a
person
who
is
sick,
demented,
twisted,
as
my
client
has
shown
himself
to
be
here
on
the
stand.
i
think
it's
a
coherent
strategy.
in
fact,
i
don't
see
easily
how
he
could
have
done
better.
and
as
in
landrigan,
if
he
had
said,
give
him
sympathy,
give
him
a
life
sentence,
which
was
the
thrust
of
the
entire
proceedings,
i
don't
think
that
that
created
--
that
lack
of
saying
that
created
any
prejudice
on
this
record,
which
was
very
thoroughly
established,
in
part
by
his
client
's
own
testimony.
i
would
also
say
in
yarborough,
on
the
deficiency
point,
this
court
said
that
focusing
in
on
one
particular
theme
may
well
be
a
preferable
strategy,
and
there
has
to
be
broad
deference
given
to
closing,
which
is
only
a
part,
after
all,
of
the
entire
sentencing
proceeding,
in
that
taking
an
understated
approach
that
--
that
emphasizes
the
jury's
autonomy.
in
yarborough,
if
you
remember,
the
defense
counsel
did
not
actually
ask
specifically
in
so
many
words
for
a
life
sentence.
the
court
said
that's
not
deficient.
he
could
count
on
the
judge's
charge
to
the
jury.
they
were
going
to
charge
the
jury
as
to
how
to
handle
the
evidence.
it
was
the
thrust
of
the
whole
proceedings.
he
presented
three
mental
health
experts
to
show
mental
illness
and
diminished
ability
to
intend.
and
he
argued
that
as
part
of
his
closing.
i
think
it
was
not
deficient,
and
i
certainly
think
on
this
record,
this
stunning
record
created
in
part
by
his
client's
crimes,
which
were
acknowledged
and
undisputed
and
there
was
no
factual
dispute
about
them
and
their
heinousness,
and
then
by
his
client's
testimony
on
the
stand,
which
graphically
and
at
great
length
reinforced
his,
again,
triumph
in
his
--
in
his
warfare
against
trying
to
kill
as
many
black
people,
jewish
people
and
gay
people
as
he
could
find,
and
that
he
would
continue
that
warfare
if
given
the
chance.
i
think
it's
impossible
to
find
that
there
is
prejudice
on
this
record
for
the
--
for
the
--
for
the
--
even
the
medium-sized
quibbles
that
are
being
raised
here
20
years
after
the
fact.
if
i
--
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
cordray
thank
you,
your
honor.
on
the
mills
instruction,
it
--
it's
clear,
mills
was
not
decided
at
the
time
the
ohio
supreme
court
rendered
its
decision.
it
was
decided
before
this
court
denied
direct
review.
mr.
richard
cordray
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
cordray
no.
nor
am
i
making
it
now.
mr.
richard
cordray
i
am
simply
summarizing
a
response
to
justice
sotomayor's
question.
but
this
court
--
on
--
on
teague,
in
beard
v
banks
determined
that
mills
itself
expressed
a
new
rule
and
expressed
some
doubt
as
to
whether
that
rule
itself
was
even
clear
until
mckoy
v.
north
carolina
was
decided
in
1990,
which
was
subsequent
to
finality
in
this
case.
but
the
--
the
jury
instruction
issue
is
entirely
knocked
out
by
the
fact
that
this
case
is
an
extension
of
mills
that
goes
beyond
anything
this
court
has
ever
held
in
the
jury
instruction
context.
it
is
an
extension
of
mills
that
has
been
rejected
by
the
majority
of
circuits
to
consider
it,
even
today
20
years
later,
and
it
couldn't
possibly
be
understood
to
be
clearly
established
law.
the
reference
to
page
326a
and
the
jury
instructions,
that's
quite
distinct
from
the
passage
where
the
jury
was
told
specifically
they
have
to
be
unanimous
only
on
the
ultimate
question,
whether
aggravators
outweigh
mitigators.
this
was
very
different
from
the
jury
form
in
mills
which
was
itself
was
somewhat
cryptic
and
--
and
later
was
explained
further
in
mckoy.
if
i
could
return
then
to
the
ineffectiveness
issues.
counsel
argued
that
there
was
deficiency
on
a
couple
of
different
grounds.
first
of
all,
that
--
that
defense
counsel
should
have
argued
about
family
background
and
performance
in
prison.
the
family
background
was
uncontested;
it
was
humdrum;
there
was
nothing
special
there.
performance
in
prison
was
an
issue
that
was
raised
at
trial.
the
prosecutor
read
to
spisak
on
the
stand
a
letter
he
had
written
from
prison.
i
am
not
going
to
foul
the
record
with
his
specific
verbiage
but
it
was
after
a
card
game
in
which
he
had
gotten
into
a
fight
with
inmates
and
said
he
would
like
to
kill
them.
when
that
was
read
to
spisak
on
the
stand
his
response
was
to
say
"heil,
hitler"
and
give
the
nazi
salute
to
the
jury.
so
the
notion
that
we
should
be
referring
back
to
his
performance
in
prison
and
that
somehow
would
have
helped
mitigate
the
jury's
consideration
of
the
death
sentence
to
me
is
--
is
fanciful.
in
terms
of
the
argument
that
defense
counsel
here
argued,
nonstatutory
aggravators,
that
is
a
characterization
that
i
don't
think
is
accurate
and
it's
not
accurate
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law.
in
our
reply
brief
we
cited
state
v.
hancock
which
indicates
that
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
crimes
are
always
relevant
in
determining
whether
the
aggravators
outweigh
the
mitigators,
and
in
fact
the
main
aggravator
here
was
that
mr.
spisak
engaged
in
a
course
of
conduct
that
involved
the
purposeful
killing
of
more
than
one
person
--
two
or
more
persons,
or
the
attempt
to
kill
two
or
more
persons
which
he
had
done
here
and
which
certainly
was
going
to
be
and
was,
in
fact,
in
fact
if
you
read
the
prosecutor's
closing,
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
prosecutor's
closing.
as
to
whether
the
mental
health
presentation
was,
quote,
"not
strong
enough",
obviously
it
wasn't
strong
enough
in
the
end
to
sway
the
jury.
but
you
cannot
judge
by
hindsight,
this
court
has
said
it
again
and
again,
counsel's
performance.
the
court
said
that
in
strickland
v.
washington
itself,
emphasized
that
tremendously
in
rejecting
the
deficiency
claim
in
that
case.
and
then
in
yarborough
as
applied
to
closing
arguments,
the
court
said
very
specifically
we
have
to
be
doubly
deferential
to
--
to
strategic
decisions
made
at
closing,
even
if
we
might
had
made
them
differently
or
might
have
executed
them
somewhat
differently,
and
particularly
through
the
aedpa
lens.
mr.
richard
cordray
i
think
that
we
have
to
read
the
statute.
the
statute
--
the
aedpa
statute,
2254
says
we
defer
to
what?
we
defer
to
an
adjudication
by
the
state
court
on
the
merits.
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
this
adjudication
was
on
some
procedural
grounds
or
default
grounds.
it
was
a
merits
adjudication.
it
wasn't
a
lengthy,
eloquent,
you
know,
long
explained
adjudication,
but
it
was
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
and
deference
should
be
given.
the
alternative
is
that
if
they
don't
explain
which
prong
they
are
using
that
you
defer
to
nothing,
and
that
seems
to
be
not
consistent
with
what
congress
clearly
intended
under
aedpa,
nor
is
it
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
claim
was
made
that
the
deference
only
applies
when
the
state
court,
quote,
"has
done
its
job".
under
the
statute
the
job
is
to
adjudicate
a
claim
on
the
merits,
not
to
provide
a
lengthy
discourse
in
doing
so.
as
to
the
prejudice
point
which
i
think
is
finally
decisive
and
was
the
basis
on
which
this
court
gvr'd
in
--
in
landrigan,
this
is
landrigan--
mr.
richard
cordray
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
cordray
i
believe,
your
honor,
under
the
statute,
it
would
be
the
same,
although
here
they
did
more
than
that
--
you
know,
they
cited
strickland.
we
have
to
assume
they
applied
strickland.
and,
as
for
the
prejudice
claim,
we
have
findings
from
the
ohio
supreme
court
that,
i
think,
bear
on
the
prejudice
claim.
in
its
decision
--
this
is
309(a)
through
311(a)
of
the
appendix--
mr.
richard
cordray
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
cordray
i
think
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
entitled
to
deference
because
it
adjudicated
a
claim
on
the
merits,
so--
mr.
richard
cordray
--i
would
agree
with
that.
however,
if
the
court
was
inclined
to
make
gradation
--
this
is
a
gradation
beyond
simply
an
unexplained
order.
yes.
as
to
prejudice,
the
ohio
supreme
court
at
309(a)
through
311(a)
itself
independently
reweighed
the
aggravating
factors
against
the
mitigating
factors,
which
is
something
the
ohio
supreme
court
does
under
ohio
law.
there
had
been
some
issues
of
merger
of
some
of
the
aggravating
circumstances.
on
direct
appeal,
they
had
dealt
with
those
issues,
and
then
they
went
back
and
reweighed,
and
they
found
that,
on
this
record,
the
aggravating
factors
heavily
--
lie
heavily
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
outweigh
the
mitigating
factors.
that
is,
in
fact,
the
same
kind
of
determination
that
the
court
would
make
in
trying
to
determine
if
there
was
prejudice
here.
as
to
the
implementation
of
the
strategy
here,
it
is
coherent
in
understanding
what
counsel
was
trying
to
do.
was
it
a
bit
rambling?
perhaps.
you
know,
were
there
--
were
there
side
issues
that
he
tried
to
take
up,
which
he
thought
went
to
his
credibility
with
the
jury
and
the
credibility
of
the
mental
illness
defense
with
the
jury?
but
the
strategy
was
twofold.
it
was
to
reference
the
crimes,
make
it
clear
to
the
jury
he
understood
the
nature
--
the
horrific
nature
of
the
crimes,
as
he
thought
the
jury
understood
it,
and
then
pivot
to
the
mental
illness
--
mental
disease
or
defect
prong
as
the
mitigator
that
the
--
that
the
jury
should
apply
in
not
giving
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
i
think
the
strategy
was
coherent.
i'm
not
sure
what
else
defense
counsel
could
have
done
in
this
case,
where
his
client
had
both
committed
these
horrific
crimes,
undisputed,
and
then
had
reveled
in
them,
in
his
flamboyant
testimony
from
the
stand.
in
the
context
of
that
and
given
the
doubly
deferential
lens
this
court
has
laid
out
in
yarborough,
i
think
that
there
is
neither
deficiency,
nor
could
there
be
prejudice
on
this
record.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
thank
you
for
your
time.
