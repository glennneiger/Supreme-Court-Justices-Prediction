justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
you
have
done?
i
mean,
i'm
--
i'm
not
experienced
in
this.
but
i
mean,
i
have
heard
the
other
side
and
i
have
read
the
argument.
and
it
makes
sense
logically
to
say
he
has
the
worst
defendant
he
has
ever
seen.
he's
murdered
lots
of
people
in
cold
blood.
he
gets
up
on
the
stand
and
says:
i'm
going
to
kill
a
lot
more.
he
sounds
totally
bonkers.
and
--
and
he
says
to
the
jury,
i
can't
tell
you
that
what
he
did
was
not
aggravating;
it
was
terrible.
i
can't
tell
you
that
there's
anything
here
that
should
make
you
feel
better
about
him;
there
is
nothing.
but
we
are
a
nation
of
people
who
are
humane
and
our
law
says
don't
put
a
person
to
death
when
he
fills
with
his
nuttiness
that
third
prong,
which
is
a
lower
standard
of
insanity
than
i
had
to
meet.
but
it's
clearly
met
and
here
are
the
experts;
i
point
to
their
testimony,
and
that's
what
they
said.
so
be
humane.
now,
you
think
he
should
have
said
something
else.
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he
--
he
said
why.
he
said.
he
said:
we
don't
execute
people
who
are
crazy
and
this
guy
is
crazy.
he
might
not
be
crazy
enough
to
meet
the
standard
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
he's
not
crazy
enough
to
meet
the
standard
of
incompetency,
but
you
just
heard
three
experts
tell
you
that
he's
seriously
crazy.
and
if
you
don't
--
if
you
doubt
them,
don't
doubt
your
own
eyes.
i
don't
see
--
how
can
i
sit
--
and
we
have
courts,
two
courts
who
said,
yeah,
that
was
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
we
had
at
least
one
state
court
that
found
it
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
agree
with
all
that
you
are
saying.
what
i
am
saying
my
hard
time
is
here
is
why
wasn't
this
advocacy,
when
indeed
a
reasonable
decision
as
to
what
constituted
advocacy
in
those
really
rare
circumstances
where
it
was
the
worst
kind
of
defendant
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
who
deserved
no
sympathy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
talked
about
nothing
else.
and
i
understand
--
look,
i
am
not
an
expert.
i
haven't
argued
these
things
to
juries,
and
i
recognize
some
lawyers
tell
me,
okay,
this
was
very
rambling.
i
didn't
think
it
was
rambling.
i
thought
he
was
trying
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
explaining
away
to
the
jury
some
prosecutorial
remark,
that
you
shouldn't
pay
attention
to
the
expert
because
you,
yourself,
the
lawyer,
didn't
talk
to
them
enough.
and
so
you
describe
that
for
a
couple
of
pages
and
why
it
was
irrelevant,
and
the
reason
he
talked
about
the
--
i
thought,
the
reason
he
talked
about
the
--
how
you
will
feel
when
you
go
out
of
here,
is
because
he
recognizes
this
is
the
most
sensational
case
in
this
community,
ever,
and
all
your
neighbors
are
going
to
congratulate
you.
but
what
you
are
doing
here
is
you
are
applying
a
standard,
and
you
are
proud
to
be
an
american,
and
that
standard,
as
an
american,
is
a
humane
standard
that
requires
you
to
not
give
the
death
penalty
when
the
man's
insane.
now,
i
agree
that
he
repeated
that
7
or
8
or
9
or
10
times,
but
it
was
the
same
point
over
and
over.
and
how
can
i
--
since
there
is
a
lower
court
that
seemed
to
find
this
adequate,
how
can
i
sit
here
and
say
it
wasn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
--
didn't
they
cite
strickland?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
guess
then
they
concede
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
we
have
no
idea
then?
if
they
cited
strickland,
why
do
we
have
no
idea
what
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
--
how
does
that
work?
certainly,
it's
a
fairly
common
thing,
that
the
defendant
will
make
--
let's
say,
20
arguments,
maybe
he
would
even
number
them.
and
it's
fairly
common
to
find
a
court
of
appeals
in
a
state
that
says,
as
to
argument
number
17,
and
then
they
characterize
it,
we
reject
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
--
that
happens
all
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
now,
it's
very,
very
common
that,
in
making
that
argument,
there
could
be
some
good
grounds
for
rejecting
it,
and
there
could
be
some
bad
grounds
for
rejecting
it.
so
would
we
send
--
do
we
send
every
case
like
that
back,
to
say,
i
want
to
know
if
you
rejected
it
for
a
good
reason
or
a
bad
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
we
do
is
we
assume
they
did
it
for
a
bad
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
authority
for
that?
because,
i
mean,
i'm
not
positive
of
this
one,
but
i
--
i
do
think
hearing
it
that
suddenly
habeas
opinions
and
district
court
opinions
would
grow
by
an
order
of
magnitude,
because
it's
very
common
to
see
arguments
rejected
summarily.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
there
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
if
they
reject
it
summarily,
that
then
we
don't
assume
they
are
right,
but
rather
we
assume
they
are
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
wouldn't
you
do
that
as
well,
then,
even
a
fortiori,
where
i'm
just
an
appeals
court
judge
and
i
get
a
district
court
opinion?
most
common
thing
in
the
world,
summary
judgment
denied,
motion
denied,
this
denied,
denied,
denied.
and
if
i'm
going
to
start
doing
this
for
state
cases,
wouldn't
i
also
have
to
do
it
for
federal
cases
whenever
a
federal
judge
doesn't
give
all
his
reasons,
which
is
the
most
common
thing
in
the
world?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
did?
i
mean,
i've
reviewed
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
and
i've
always
thought
that
a
trial
judge
doesn't
have
to
spell
out
all
his
reasons.
and
the
question
is
really,
given
the
circumstance,
can
we
say
that
he
acted
contrary
to
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
trial-based,
you
look
at
what
the
facts
are
that
he
might
have
taken.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
saying
--
i
mean,
this
is
very
helpful
to
me
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
but
is
--
in
your
view,
the
correct
role
of
the
habeas
judge
vis-à-vis
the
state
judge
there
is
the
same
as
the
federal
appellate
judge
vis-à-vis
the
district
judge?
that
is,
i'm
thinking
of
a
district
judge
makes
a
finding,
doesn't
fully
explain
it.
now,
i
would
think
it
would
be
unlawful
if
it's
an
unreasonable
application
of
a
supreme
court
case.
and
i
know
how
to
review
that.
i
mean,
i
--
i
know
how
to
review
it,
i
think.
okay.
so
you
are
saying
however
i
do
that,
i
should
do
the
same
thing
and
the
--
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
there
is
a
more
relaxed
standard
than
that?
you
think
that's
basically
the
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
same
--
but
if
they
had
made
an
explicit
finding,
then
maybe
it
would
be
a
tougher
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
respondent
in
this
case,
frank
spisak,
was
convicted
in
an
ohio
court
of
three
murders
and
two
attempted
murders.
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
the
ohio
court
rejected
his
appeals.
the
federal
district
court
denied
his
habeas
corpus
request,
but
then
when
he
appealed
that
habeas
corpus
denial,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
accepted
two
of
his
constitutional
claims.
on
the
request
of
the
state
we
have
reviewed
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
insofar
as
it
accepted
those
two
claims.
now
his
first
claim,
the
first
thing
he
argued
was
that
the
jury
instructions
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
his
trial,
instructions
that
had
to
do
with
how
the
juries
should
treat
the
factors
that
arguably
were
mitigating,
he
argued
that
those
instructions
were
unconstitutional
under
this
court's
holding
in
a
case
called
mills
v.
maryland.
now
mills
focused
upon
instances
where
defendant
points
to
several
different
potentially
mitigating
factors.
i
mean,
imagine
he
had
a
difficult
childhood,
he
had
horrific
war
service
and
he
was
also
mentally
disturbed
and
what
mills
says
is
that
the
judge,
when
he
tells
the
jury
that
they
have
to
balance
the
mitigating
factors
against
the
aggravating
factors,
the
judge
should
not
leave
the
jury
with
the
impression
that
it
has
to
decide
unanimously
that
a
particular
factor
is
mitigating.
suppose
some
jurors
think
that
the
childhood
is
mitigating,
others
might
think
the
war
service
is
mitigating,
the
judge
cannot
forbid
the
first
group
from
considering
childhood
as
mitigating,
simply
because
other
jurors
disagreed
about
that
one,
they
may
think
some
other
one.
so
after
we
read
the,
and
i
read
the
instructions
in
this
case,
we've
compared
them
with
those
that
were
at
issue
in
mills
and
bottom
line
is
we
think
the
judge
here
did
not
commit
the
error
that
was
at
issue
in
mills.
so
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
have
accepted
that
claim
in
our
view
and
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
opinion.
spisak's
second
claim
is
that
his
lawyer
provided
constitutionally
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
when
he
made
his
closing
defense
argument
to
the
sentencing
jury.
again
this
is
a
matter
reviewing
the
record
and
after
doing
it
we
don't
express
any
view
on
the
quality
of
counsel's
argument,
but
we
do
conclude
that
there
was
no
reasonable
probability
that
a
better
argument
would
have
made
a
difference,
that
is
to
say
legally
speaking
the
argument's
deficiencies
couldn't
have
changed
the
result
if
they
did
better.
now
we
spell
out
all
this
in
our
opinion.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
determination.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
result.
