justice
antonin
scalia
these
experts
said
he
had
improved?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
this
testimony
on
the
stand?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
didn't
look
like
improvement
to
me.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
was
swallowing
the
worst
evidence.
it
was
telling
the
jury
that
was
going
to
think
this
is
a
hateful
person
who
had
done
hateful
things.
i
agree
with
you.
i
accept
all
of
that,
but
even
if
you
feel
that
way,
i
thought
it
was
a
brilliant
closing
argument.
you
said
you've
--
you've
conducted
many
capital
cases.
have
you
ever
conducted
a
capital
case
in
which
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
with
a
hitler
moustache
and
says
he's
glad
for
what
he's
done
and
he
will
do
it
again?
how
many
cases
have
you
had
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
an
extraordinary
trial,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
technique
that
--
that
counsel
used
to
try
to
get
mercy
for
this
fellow
was
--
was
the
best
that
could
have
been
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
think
that
we
have
to
defer
to
all
of
those,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think,
if
they
could
have
been
relying
on
any
of
those,
we
would
have
to
defer
to
all,
wouldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
one-by-one,
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
would
we
assume
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
we
--
when
you
don't
know
what
a
lower
court
has
done,
the
rule
is
you
assume
the
best,
not
the
worst.
isn't
that
the
standard
rule
of
review?
justice
antonin
scalia
you,
very
often,
don't
know
on
what
basis
the
lower
court
took
action.
you
assume
it
was
a
lawful
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
insulates
it
from
being
overturned.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
not
what
aedpa
says.
aedpa
says
that
we
have
to
give
deference
unless
it
is
an
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
law.
the
burden
is
on
the
appealing
defendant
to
show
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
application.
in
case
of
doubt,
he
loses.
now,
aedpa
could
have
been
written
differently.
it
could
have
been
written
the
way
you
want.
the
supreme
court
shall
evaluate
the
reasonableness
of
the
supreme
court
opinion.
it
isn't
written
that
way.
it
says
the
burden
is
on
you
to
show
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
law.
and
where
there
is
a
summary
disposition,
that's
a
hard
road
aho.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
not
impossible.
i
think
there
are
cases
where
--
where
relying
on
prior
supreme
court
law
doesn't
get
you
there.
it's
not
impossible.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
should
revise
the
statute
and
it
should
not
say
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
how
the
--
that's
not
how
the
statute
reads.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
says
that
you
have
to
show
that
it
is
an
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
law.
that's
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
can't,
you
lose.
because
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
say
if
they
can't,
we
have
a
new
statute.
but
we
don't.
the
burden
on
you
is
to
show
that
it's
an
unreasonable
application.
if
you
tell
me
we
can't
tell,
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i
don't
understand
that,
i
don't
understand
that.
do
you
want
to
go
around
that
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
teague
say
anything
about
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
is
that
in
the
instructions?
i
--
i
didn't
realize
that
that's
what
you
are
counting
on.
where
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
your
brief,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
read
it
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
new?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
in
your
brief,
too?
i
just
don't
remember
it
from
your
brief.
