justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
cordray,
under
the
charge
that
was
given,
what
happens
if
there
is
a
juror
who
thinks
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
don't
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances?
under
ohio's
current
instruction
that
means
no
death
penalty.
but
under
the
instruction
that
was
given
here,
that
all
12
must
agree
on
--
on
the
aggravators
outweighing
the
mitigators,
what
is
the
consequence
of
a
failure
of
the
jurors
to
agree
on
that
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
--
under
the
charge
that
was
given
in
this
case,
you
say
it
would
be
--
then
the
judge
would
be
obliged
to
give
one
of
the
two
life
sentences.
it
would
not
be
a
deadlock
requiring
a
resentencing
hearing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
cordray--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
reading
that
closing
argument,
it
is
disjointed.
it
goes
off
on
tangents
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
sentence
that
the
defendant
is
getting.
i
mean,
it
really
is
quite
a
stream
of
consciousness.
and
what's
remarkable
about
it
is
at
no
point
did
counsel
say,
give
him
a
life
sentence.
he
said
that
either
one
would
be
acceptable,
either
death
or
life
would
be
acceptable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
benza,
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
ineffective
assistance
was
found
on
the
basis
of
a
closing
argument
alone?
general
cordray
pointed
out
that
this
lawyer
had
put
on
a
number
of
witnesses
to
testify
to
the
defendant's
mental
illness,
and
that
he
did
play
that
theme
in
the
closing.
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
the
closing,
not
tied
to
the
way
the
case
was
presented
at
trial,
was
held
sufficient
to
constitute
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
just
told
me
that,
under
strickland,
under
anything,
there
has
been
no
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
decision
for
the
defendant,
based
on
the
inadequacy
of
the
closing
argument
alone.
so
you
are
asking
us
to
take
a
new
tact
and
inviting
arguments
focused
exclusively
on
the
closing
argument,
to
see
if
it
meets
the
strickland
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
why
isn't
it
the
strickland
analysis
that
you
read
the
charge
in
the
context
of
the
case
that
was
presented
at
trial,
and,
here,
the
case
was.
the
only
thing
going
for
the
defendant
were
the
witnesses
to
his
mental
illness
and
whether,
eloquently
or
not,
that
theme
was
played
to
the
jury.
this
is
a
mentally
ill
man.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
--
how
many
issues
were
before
the
ohio
supreme
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
ohio
supreme
court,
faced
with
67
issues,
would
have
to
write
at
least
a
per
curiam
opinion
on
each
of
the
67
to
insulate
itself
against
being
overturned
on
federal
habeas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
benza,
you
might
want
to
use
what
time
is
remaining
to
deal
with
the
other
issue,
which
we
haven't
talked
about
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
that
work?
the
instruction
was
all
12
must
agree
that
the
aggravators
outweigh
the
mitigators
before
death
is
imposed.
