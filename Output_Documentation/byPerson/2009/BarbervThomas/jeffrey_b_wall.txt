mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
i
think
you
stole
my
thunder.
i
wanted
to
explain
how
the
bureau
does
it,
and
you
laid
it
out
exactly
right.
if
you
have
--
and
i
think
just
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
tracks
perfectly.
if
you
have
a
prisoner
serving
a
10-year
sentence
and
he
comes
in
on
january
1st,
the
end
of
his
first
year
of
imprisonment
is
december
31st,
and
on
that
date
he
gets
54
days
taken
off
the
back
end
of
the
sentence.
that
cycle
repeats
itself
for
the
next
8
years.
and--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
and
that's
why
they
have
the
sentence
at
the
end,
as
you
pointed
out
about
the
proration.
so
when
the
--
when
the
statute
says,
what
it
says
--
starts
by
saying
is,
if
you
are
serving
a
sentence
of
longer
than
a
year
you
are
eligible
for
good
time
credit.
so
you
are
earning
credit
as
you
go
through
that
first
year.
congress
knew
then
if
you
had
have
a
year
and
a
day
sentence,
you
wouldn't
be
actually
serving
a
full
year
because
of
the
credits
bringing
you
below
the
year
mark.
so
what
it
does
in
the
last
sentence,
it
says
if
you
are
in
your
last
year
and
that's
a
partial
year,
we
prorate.
so
on
your
319th
day
you
have
earned
47
days
of
good
time
credit.
those
combined
equal
a
sentence
of
a
year
and
a
day,
and
you
are
out
after
your
319th
day.
on
the
hypothetical--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
why
for
each
full
year
served,
so
for
a
10-year
sentence,
you
are
right
that
you
are
making
a
determination
at
the
end
of
the
year
for
the
first
8
years,
but
when
you
get
to
that
ninth
year,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--so,
the
way
this
works
is
that
for
the
prisoner
sentenced
to
a
year
and
a
day
or
13
months
or
14
months,
because
they
are
receiving
credit
through
that
first
year,
their
good
time
credit
brings
them
below
a
year.
they'll
never
serve
a
full
year.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
and
what
the
law--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--except
for
the
last
year
or
partial
year.
and
what
the
final
sentence
of
b1
says
is,
credit
for
the
last
year
or
portion
of
a
year
of
the
term
of
imprisonment
shall
be
prorated
and
credited
within
the
last
6
weeks.
so
for
the
prisoner
who
has
a
year
and
a
day
sentence,
his
sentence
is
literally
all
proration.
he
is
just
serving
a
partial
year.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right.
on
the
319th
day
he
has
come
through
about
nine
tenths
of
the
year,
he
has
accrued
47
days.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
right.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
right.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
absolutely.
which
is
to
say
when
the
prisoner
gets
to
his
last
year,
if
that's
a
partial
year,
he
is
not
going
to
get
the
54
days,
he's
going
to
get
some
portion
of
the
54
days,
based
on
what
part
of
a
year
he
served.
and
that
is
prorated
and
credited
within
the
last
6
weeks.
now,
it's
normally
done
on
the
release
date.
so
in
that
9th
year
for
the
10-year
prisoner--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
--
that's
right.
540
wouldn't
be
quite
2
years,
but
setting
that
to
the
side--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
under
the
government's
view
he
can
only
earn
good
time
credit
when
he
is
actually
incarcerated.
and
what
petitioners
are
coming
in
and
saying--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
so,
if
you
take
a
10-year
prisoner
--
a
prisoner
with
a
10-year
sentence,
the
way
it
currently
works,
at
the
end
of
the
8th
year
he
has
accrued
432
days
of
good
time
credit.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
right.
so
he
knocked
off
his
full
10th
year
and
he's
knocked
off
a
part
of
his
9th
year.
now
we
are
at
that
final
9th
year,
which
is
a
prorated
year.
he
has
got
298
days
left
and
by
the
260th
day
he
earned
38
days
of
credit.
so
he
is
released
after
the
260th
day
of
his
9th
year.
and
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
that
precisely
tracks
the
language
of
the
statute.
you
do
it
at
the
end
of
each
full
year
until
you
get
to
the
last
partial
year,
and
then
you
prorate
and
you
do
it
in
the
last
6
weeks.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right.
so
the
--
the
petitioners
here,
petitioner
barber,
for
instance,
has
been
incarcerated
for
over
17
years.
at
the
end
of
each
of
his
17
years
in
prison,
he
has
gotten
54
days
of
credit.
what
petitioner
barber
is
here
saying
is,
i
am
going
to
get
3
whole
years
knocked
off
the
end
of
my
sentence;
i
want
the
54
days
for
those
years,
too.
i
want
54
days
for
every
year
of
my
sentence
as
imposed
by
the
court,
not
as
served
by
me
behind
bars,
and
that's
what
doesn't
track
the
language
of
the
statute.
because
the
only
way
you
can
do
that,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
is
to
read
311
days,
and
it
is
no
answer
to
say,
as
petitioners
do,
well,
you
can
do
the
determination
whenever.
what
they
are
saying
is
at
the
end
of
a
311-day
period,
you
should
determine
whether
the
prisoner
gets
the
credit.
but
what
the
statute
says
is
the
determination
itself
has
to
occur
at
the
end
of
the
year.
so
you
can't
fold
the
54
days
into
the
year
because
you
haven't
made
the
determination
yet.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
that's
right,
which
first
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
says
at
the
end
of
each
year,
so
that
reads
311-day
cycle.
but
it
also
sets
up
a
very
odd
system.
what
happens
if
the
prisoner
misbehaves
during
days
312
and
day
365?
on
petitioner's
approach,
it
seems
to
me,
the
new
year
has
started
on
day
312.
now,
but
take
the
example,
he
says,
well,
you
can
do
it
on
the
365th
day.
well,
if
the
prisoner's
misbehaved
on
day
340,
is
that
coming
out
of
the
first
year
or
out
of
the
second
year.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
and
i
guess
the
--
the
difficulty
with
that
approach
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
once
the
311-day
cycle
is
finished,
you
have
to
start
a
new
311-day
cycle
on
day
312.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
so
vesting
is
a
little
bit
unique,
justice
kennedy,
under
the
statute,
because
none
of
the
time
vests
under
(b)(2)
until
they
are
actually
released.
but--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
see
--
i
see
what
you're
saying.
they
could
do
the
bookkeeping
determination
on
day
365.
but
i
don't
think
that's
what's
important.
what
is
important
is
that
on
petitioner's
view,
the
second
year,
for
credit
purposes,
has
to
start
on
day
312.
you
have
to
have
10
blocks
of
311
days
and
you
have
to
be
measuring
after
every
311th
day.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
if
you
are
measuring
365
days
from
day
311--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--then
you
should
equally
be
measuring
365
days
from
day
1.
which
is
to
say,
if
you're
doing--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
the
--
i
was
half
with
you
there.
the
bureau
does
do
it
by
looking
at
what
they
do
during
the
full
year,
from
january
1
to
december
31,
and
then
it
determines
whether
you
get
54
days
knocked
off
the
end
of
your
sentence.
what
happens
between
day
311
and
day
365
is
not
different
than
what
happens
during
the
rest
of
the
year.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
what
the
--
what
the
statute
asks
the
bureau
to
determine
is,
at
the
end
of
each
year,
has,
during
that
year,
the
prisoner
demonstrated
exemplary
compliance
with
institutional
regulations?
so
the
prisoner
has
got
to
go
a
full
year,
a
full
365
days,
and
be
well-behaved.
then
he
gets
54
days
taken
off
the
back
end
of
the
sentence.
and
if
that's
the
way
that
you're
saying
it
should
work,
that
is
precisely
how
the
bureau
interprets
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
sets
up
an
odd
system.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no,
i
--
i
agree.
that
is
the
difference.
petitioners
think
that
you
measure
credit
over
these
311-day
cycles,
and
if
you
--
you
know,
you
get
to
the
311th
day,
you
take
the
54
days
of
credit,
and
together,
they
equal
a
year
of
the
sentence
imposed.
but
what
the
statute
says
is
you
make
the
determination
at
the
end
of
the
year.
and
we
don't
read
311-day
period.
we
read
it
to
be
a
365-day
period.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
but
what
--
that's
right.
but
what
the
statute
--
the
statute
doesn't
just
say,
justice
stevens,
you
make
the
determination
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
the
term.
the
determination
is
that
during
that
year,
the
prisoner
has
displayed
compliance.
so
he
has
got
to
display
compliance
through
day
1
through
day
365.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no.
he
can
lose
credit
that
he
has
accrued
up
to
that
point,
but
he
can't
lose
credit
that
he
has
--
that
he
is
eligible
for
in
future
years.
so
let's
say
that
we
are
coming
up
on
the
end
of
the
3rd
year.
he's
earned
his
full
108
days
for
his
first
two
years,
and
he
has
earned
some
prorated
portion.
he
can
lose
any
of
that,
but
he
is
still
eligible
going
forward
to
keep
getting
54
days
at
the
end
of
each
year.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
have
been
more
clear.
for
prisoners
sentenced
subject
to
the
sra,
which
was
in
effect
from
1987
to
1994,
you
are
right.
and
that
is
the
sra
according
to
your
brief.
their
credit
vests.
that
vesting
requirement
was
eliminated
in
the
plra,
which
governs
prisoner's
sentences
since
1996.
so
for
the
vast
bulk
of
prisoners
in
the
federal
system
who
are
subject
to
the
plra,
their
credit
does
not
vest
until
they
are
released.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
two
reasons.
i
think
to
the
extent
that
you
are
suggesting
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
charged
by
congress
with
administering
the
statute
in
both
reno
v.
koray
and
lopez
v.
davis.
this
court
deferred
to
the
bureau's
interpretation
of
other
prisoner
credit
statutes.
we
think
the
bureau
is
equally
entitled
to
the
same
discretion
here
to
interpret
this
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
this
court's
been
clear
--
and
i
--
i
can't
put
it
any
better
than
justice
sotomayor
did
in
her
first
opinion
in
sash
--
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
statute.
it
neither
imposes
a
criminal
prohibition
on
conduct
nor--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
it's
a
check
against
the
power
of
the
state
when
it's
penalizing
conduct
or
when
it's
putting
forth
a
penalty
for
a
criminal
prohibition.
but
in
both
koray
and
lopez,
this
court
was
considering
what
prisoner
credit
statutes
meant,
other
prisoner
credit
statutes.
18
u.s.c.
3585
and
3621.
and
in
both
of
those,
it
deferred
to
the
bureau's
interpretation.
and
in
both,
it
specifically
rejected
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity.
and
i
think
the
notion
there
is
that
this
statute
is
not
a
criminal
statute.
it's
about
an
administrative
reward
for
compliance
with
institutional
regulations.
and
that's
different
from
setting
forth
a
prohibition
on
conduct
where
the
penalty
that
someone
is
sentenced
to
by
a
court
once
they
have
been
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
it
is
a
statute
that
determines
in
some
sense
how
long
you
will
be
in
prison,
so
i
take
your
point.
but
it
does
so
not
by
extending
the
penalty
applicable
to
the
conduct,
but
by
offering
an
administrative
reward;
sort
of
relieving
you
of
part
of
the
burden
of
that
--
that
penalty.
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
case
--
and
i
am
obviously
not
familiar
with
granderson,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
case
from
this
court,
or
indeed
any
lower
court,
finding
that
section
3624
is
a
criminal
statute,
as
this
court's
cases
uses
the
term.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i'm
--
i
think
the
basis
for
that
is
just
math
that
the
petitioners
have
done.
i
don't
have
any
independent
basis
for
confirming
or
denying
it.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
it's
a
factor
that
the
bureau
could,
should
and
has
taken
into
consideration
in
the
developing
its
interpretation
as
the
agency
in
charge
of
administering
the
statute.
but
what
the
bureau
has
found
is
that
it's
method
allows
you
to
earn
good
time
for
all
the
time
you
are
incarcerated,
so
you
always
have
incentive
to
follow
prison
regulations.
and
what
petitioners
haven't
responded
to
and
the
government's
point
in
our
brief
that
if
you
start
measuring
by
311-day
cycles,
you
are
assuming
that
they
getting
the
full
54
days
of
credit.
and
to
the
extent
that
they
don't,
no
matter
how
they
calculate
it,
justice
scalia,
no
matter
what
their
matter
of
bookkeeping
is,
if
they
don't
get
the
54
days
of
credit
for
each
cycle,
there
will
be
some
corresponding
period
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
when
they
are
serving
time
and
they
have
already
had
their
ten
--
you
know,
their
reviews
and
they
are
no
longer
eligible
for
the--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--okay.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
breyer,
i
disagree
with
your
premise.
someone
sentenced
to
a
year
and
a
day
is
eligible
for
credit,
but
because
that
person
is
accruing
credit
as
he
serves,
he
will
never
actually
get
54
days.
by
the
time
he
gets
to
the
319th
day,
he
has
accrued
47
days
of
credit,
those
combine
to
equal
his
366-day
sentence.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
--
that's
exactly--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--and
that's
exactly
our
difference
with
petitioner's
view.
exactly.
what
petitioner--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--yes.
yes.
he
is
released
after
the
319th
day.
and
i
think
what
petitioners
actually
want
is
phantom
time
even
in
the
first
year.
what
they
are
saying
is
fine,
he
may
only
serve
311
days,
312
days,
319
days,
we
want
the
full
54.
so,
instead
of
letting
him
out
at
319,
back
him
up
to
312,
we
want
the
phantom
week
in
the
first
year.
and,
so,
i
think
the
way
the
bureau
interprets
it,
there
is
no
phantom
time
in
any
year.
the
way
the
petitioners
interpret
it,
there
is
phantom
time
in
every
year,
no
matter
the
length
of
the
sentence.
as
i
said
i
think
it
creates
a
gap
in
coverage.
it
rests
on
this
assumption
that
prisoners
are
always
getting
54
days.
that
is
just
not
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
there
are
no
statistics
on
this,
but,
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
majority
of
prisoners
do
earn
the
full
credit,
certainly
these
petitioners
have.
but
i
would
say
that
there
are,
say,
15
to
20
percent
federal
prisoner
who
tend
to
be
repeat
offenders,
and
they
are
often
being
docked
to
good
time
credit.
so,
i
think
what
you
will
see
is
that
the
ones
getting
54
days
do
it
consistently,
and
the
ones
not
getting
54
days,
often
do
that
pretty
consistently.
and,
you
know,
the
difficulty
on
petitioner's
method
is
that
no
matter
when
you
want
to
do
that
calculation,
petitioners
at
bottom
are
saying
what
you
should
be
looking
at
is
a
311-day
period,
and
you
take
the
311
days
served,
you
take
the
54
days
of
credit,
and
together
they
give
you
a
year
of
the
sentence
imposed.
and
not
only
does
that
not
serve
penological
interest,
as
the
bureau
has
found,
but
it
just
doesn't
track
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
says
during
each
year
you
have
got
to
comply
with
the
regulations.
the
statute
cares
not
just
about
your
conduct
from
days
1
to
311,
but
your
conduct
from
day
312
to
365.
all
of
those
days
are
equal
in
the
statute's
eyes.
if
you
want
54
days
of
credit
knocked
off
the
back
end
of
your
sentence,
you
have
got
to
behave
and
comply
with
the
rules
for
a
full
year
each
time
you
want
the
credit.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
other
than
the
positions
--
positions
that
the
bureau
has
taken
before
the
11
courts
of
appeals
in
which
it
has
prevails,
no,
the--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--two
points,
justice
sotomayor.
i
don't
think
the
bureau
has
always
taken
the
position
that
the
statute
is
unambiguous.
it
has
taken
the
fallback
position,
and
it
has
prevailed
on
this
position
in
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals.
and
it
is
worth
pointing
out
the
bureau
has
prevailed
in
the
first
through
the
eleventh
circuits.
it
has
won
in
11
court
of
appeals.
and
it
has
often
prevailed
on
the
ground
that
it
had
discretion
to
interpret
the
statute
to
the
extended
it
was
ambiguous.
your
second
point,
what
would
you
defer
to--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--as
the
pen
declaration
makes
clear,
and
this
is
at
page
154
of
the
joint
appendix,
when
the
bureau
promulgated
its
rule
in
1997,
it
did
that
based
on
the
statutory
language
and
on
making
a
policy
choice
to
accommodate
penological
interest,
ensuring
that
credit
would
always
be
an
incentive
to
good
behavior
and
providing
clear
notice
to
inmates
of
their
projected
release
dates.
so,
i
think
--
you
know,
the
government
has--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
it's
giving
deference
to
the
rule,
because
the
affidavit
informs
the
court
that
the
rule
is
an
exercise
of
the
bureau's
discretion.
so
far
as
i
know,
the
court
has
never
faced
that
question
but
the
lower
courts
have.
and
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
faced
with
rulemaking
and
informal
adjudication
have
accepted
supplementation
of
the
record
with
affidavits
and
declarations
very
much
like
this
one.
because
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
an
affidavit
from
one
of
the
agency's
original
decisionmakers.
if
this
was
just
a
post
hyperactualization,
i
grant
you
it
might
not
be
enough.
but
this
is
one
of
the
bureau's
lawyers
involved
in
the
decisionmaking
in
the
mid-1980's
coming
in
and
saying,
here
is
why
we
adopted
the
interpretation--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it
is
different
because
that
would
be
broadside
in
overton
park.
and
what
this
court
said
is
if
there
is
not
enough
in
the
agency
action
itself
to
enable
judicial
review,
the
right
answer
is
not
to
set
it
aside,
the
right
answer
is
to
send
it
back
to
the
agency
to
let
the
agency
decision
makers
explain
why
they
did
what
they
did.
and
while
that
might
normally
be
the
right
course
here,
the
agency
has
already
done
that.
it
has
put
forward
its
explanation,
so
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
rare
circumstances
where
we
don't
need
to
remand
on
overton
park.
we
know
why
the
agency
adopted
the
rule,
and
it
did
it
both
because
of
the
statutory
language
and
because
they
thought
it
was
the
most
sensible
policy
choice.
and
i
guess
i
would
turn
it
around
a
little
bit
and
say
you
have
a
rule
promulgated
by
the
agency
charged
with
administering
the
statute,
an
agency
to
which
this
court
has
twice
deferred
in
the
interpretation
of
similar
statutes.
that
rule
has
been
upheld
as
a
substantive
matter
now
in
11
courts
of
appeals.
the
ninth
circuit
set
the
rule
aside
on
a
procedural
basis,
which
has
now
been
corrected
by
the
agency.
it's
a
republished
rule
which
corrects
the
infirmities
that
the
court
of
appeals
identified.
and,
so,
the
question
is,
faced
with
those
facts,
what
would
be
the
point
of
asking
the
government
to
recalculate
195,000
federal
sentences?
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
even
--
even
if
you
thought
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
that
the
rule
was
procedurally
invalid,
you
would
still,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
defer
to
the
program
statement
under
some
level
of
deference,
at
least
skidmore.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
and
i--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
--
i--
[laughter]
my
only
point,
justice
scalia,
was
that
whether
you
get
there
by
deferring
to
the
rule
or
by
deferring
to
the
program
statement,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
every
court
of
appeals
to
consider
it
has
come
out
in
the
same
place,
which
is
that
by
hook
or
by
crook,
the
bureau
has
exercised
its
discretion
to
answer
this
question.
and
i--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
stevens,
i
think
what
i
would
say
is
the
bureau
has
been
doing
it
the
same
way
since
1987.
congress
has
amended
this
statute
five
times
in
the
last
20
years.
it
has
never
moved
to
alter
the
bureau's
methods.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
stevens,
with
all
respect,
justice
breyer
got
it
in
the
first
5
minutes.
so
i
think
the--
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kennedy,
that's
true.
i
think
the
point
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
has
remained
unchanged,
and
for
the
last
20
years
the
bureau
has
interpreted
that
in
a
reasonable
way.
the
language
is
unambiguous,
but
even
if
it
weren't,
at
least
the
bureau's
interpretation
is
reasonable,
which
is
why
11
courts
of
appeals
have
deferred
to
it.
and
so
i
take
your
point
that
they
are
serving
more
time
than
under
petitioner's
interpretation,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
policy
rationale
is
properly
before
this
court.
it
is
properly
before
the
bureau,
which
has
found
that
policy
consideration
outweighed
by
other
penological
interests,
and
i
think
that's
the
judgment
to
which
this
court
should
defer,
not
its
own
judgment
about
how
much
time
these
prisoners
should
--
should
be
serving.
and
i
do
think
it's
important
in
that
regard
that
congress
has
returned
the
statute
several
times.
and
i
take
your
point
that
it
is
complicated,
justice
stevens,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--but
congress
has
made
a
number
of
technical
amendments
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
it
did
not
understand
of
how
this
longstanding
system
works.
thank
you.
