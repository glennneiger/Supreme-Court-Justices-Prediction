justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
do
you
do
have
to
do
that?
i
mean
you
read
it.
it
so
complicated.
just
reading
this,
i
--
i
think
the
language
should
say
this:
10
years,
he's
got
a
10-year
sentence.
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
you
write
the
number
54
on
a
piece
of
paper
if
he
has
done
well.
suppose
he
comes
in
on
january
1,
okay?
so
january
2,
after
the
first
year,
you
write
the
word
50
--
the
number
54.
and
you
do
that
each
year.
and
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
year
8,
what
you
have
done
is
you
have
got
432
days.
so
then
you
subtract
the
430
days
from
10
years,
and
what
you
get
is
you
are
67
days
short
of
9
years.
so
now
you
look
at
the
last
sentence,
and
what
you
do
is
you
take
67
days,
subtract
that
from
365,
and
you've
got
298,
and
you
simply
prorate
for
those
298.
and
you
subtract
that,
too,
so
he
gets
another
10
days
or
so,
or
15
days
credit,
and
that's
it.
and
that's
following
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
absolutely
literally.
and
it
also
seems
to
me
to
make
sense,
because
you
don't
want
to
give
him
credit
for
time
he
never
serves.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that
isn't
what
the
--
if
you
want
to
know
what
the
sentencing
commission
did,
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
you
read
the
introduction
to
the
guidelines.
and
what
the
introduction
to
the
guidelines
says
is
that,
roughly
speaking,
many
of
the
sentences
approximate
the
time
actually
served
before.
now,
what
to
me
that
suggests
is
that
the
sentencing
commission
never
considered
this
question.
and
if
there's
something
more
specific
than
that,
that
shows
they
did,
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is,
because
i
don't
trust
memory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
nothing
in
there
--
that's
not
a
policy
statement;
that's
not
a
guideline.
that's
a
staff
conclusion.
and
the
staff
conclusion,
i
think,
is
conflicting
with
what
it
says
in
the
--
in
the
introduction
to
the
guidelines,
which
is
that
all
of
this
was
very
approximate.
i
don't
see
how
--
how
--
a
court
would
be
bound
by
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
right?
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
to
ask
you
this
question,
but
i
get
lost
in
the
math
of
this
sometimes.
do
you
remember
my
example
i
just
gave,
you
know,
with
the
9
years
you
go
and
put
it
on
a
piece
of
paper?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
what
you
want
is
you,
in
--
in
essence,
want
him
to
get
credit
for
54
days
for
that
tenth
year?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
the
argument
against
that,
reading
the
language
and
so
forth,
is,
well,
look
this
is
an
imaginary
10th
year.
he
is
not
actually
in
prison
for
10
years.
he
is
going
to
be
released
sometime
late
in
year
8.
and
so
why
should
we
add
54
days?
i
mean
maybe
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
because
sentences
are
awfully
long,
but
--
but
why
would
anybody
want
to
add
54
days
in
respect
to
a
year
that's
never
going
to
be
served?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
another
way
to
think,
and
i
think
probably
you'll
--
if
you
look
through
the
records
of
the
commission,
they
even
thought
about
this
problem,
and
the
--
the
--
you
will
see
a
lot
of
talks
given
by
various
people
who
were
there,
which
say
that
for
this
reason
you
are
bringing
up,
that
it
might
have
been
thought
there
was
no
credit
for
the
first
year.
in
other
words,
you
don't
cut
the
sentence
in
the
first
year.
you
don't
begin
cut
until
the
second
year
has
been
served,
so
he
has
to
serve
365
days.
now
when
you
point
that
out,
that
is
not
the
bureau
of
prisons's
interpretation,
that's
nobody's
interpretation.
they're
all
going
to
let
him
out
if
it's
a
year
and
a
day.
they
are
going
to
let
him
out
several
weeks
before
the
end
of
the
first
year,
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everybody's
going
to
do
that.
oh
--
there
was
a
technical
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
happened.
in
other
words,
the
statute
made
before--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--ah,
i
better
get
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
trouble
with
that,
and
i'm
glad
to
know
about
that
technical
amendment,
because
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
never
considered
it
when
i
was
on
the
--
nobody
thought
about
it
at
that
time
because
the
language
was
different.
but
now
that
you
had
have
got
this
language
now,
it's
hard
to
reconcile
with
that
first
year.
he
is
sentenced
for
a
year
and
a
day,
you
see.
so
literally,
it
says
calculated
on
january
2
of
the
next
year.
but
he's
already
been
in
for
longer
than
he
should
be
by
that
point.
so
you
really
have
to
calculate
it
before
the
year
ends;
you
have
to
calculate
it
at
least
by
october.
and
--
and
--
and
once
you
start
calculating
it
before,
the
statute
literally
says,
we
are
into
a
more
complicated
thing
than
i
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
but
the
strongest
argument
--
i
--
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
his
mouth
because
this
is
complicated.
but
i
see
it
as
this.
let's
call
that
time
you
are
talking
about,
that
tenth
year,
phantom
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
are
saying
don't
put
in
any
phantom
time.
and
he's
saying
let's
put
some
in.
now,
the
strong
--
a
strong
argument,
i
think,
for
his
is
the
following
--
think
about
that
first
year.
that
first
year
we
are
going
to
calculate
54
days,
subtract
it,
everybody
seems
to
agree
we
get
to
the
number
311,
right?
but
if
you
were
to
apply
the
last
sentence
to
that
first
year,
the
prorating
sentence,
you
wouldn't
get
54.
you
would
get
like
45
days,
or
47
or
something
like
that.
but
everybody
agrees
under
the
bureau
of
prisons
system
that
it
is
54.
and,
therefore,
in
respect
to
the
first
year,
they
are
calculating
phantom
time,
i.e.,
not
the
first
year,
but
a
person
who
had
a
sentence
to
a
year
and
a
day.
if
you
had
a
sentence
to
a
year
and
a
day,
you
agree
it's
54
days,
and
everybody
agrees
with
that,
and
that
includes
phantom
time.
so
he
said,
well,
if
you
include
it
for
the
first
year,
since
the
statute
says
nothing
about
the
first
year,
why
not
include
it
for
the
other
years,
too?
how
can
you
possibly
justify
phantom
time
being
included
in
the
first
year
but
not
in
the
other
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words,
they
don't
let
him
out
under
311?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
the
bureau
of
prisons
for
a
person
whose
has
a
sentence
of
a
year
and
a
day
does
not
let
him
out
54
days
short,
rather
they
let
him
out
47
days
short,
because
they
apply
the
last
sentence
in
the
prorating
of
that
sentence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
--
is
that
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
federal
sentencing
law
provides
“that
a
prisoner
serving
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
more
than
one
year,
may
receive
credit
towards
the
service
of
the
prisoner's
sentence
of
up
to
54
days
at
the
end
of
each
year
of
the
prisoner's
term
of
imprisonment”
based
on
a
determination
by
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
that
the
prisoner
has
exhibited
good
behavior
“during
that
year.”
this
credit
operates
as
a
reward
for
good
behavior
while
in
prison
and
for
that
reason
it
is
generally
referred
to
as
a
good
time
credit.
each
day
of
good
time
credit
that
a
prisoner
earns
up
to
54
a
year
is
one
less
day
that
he
will
spend
in
prison.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
method
used
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
calculate
good
time
credit
is
lawful?
under
the
bureau
of
prisons
method,
a
prisoner
would
have
his
good
time
calculated
at
the
end
of
each
year
he
served
except
for
the
last
year,
which
he
does
not
serve
in
full.
for
that
last
year
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
calculate
a
proportionate
amount
of
good
time.
the
petitioners
here
are
two
prisoners
who
challenge
the
bureau's
method
as
unlawful.
they
propose
a
simpler
method.
a
prisoner
sentenced
up
to
10
years,
to
10
years
for
example
would
receive
up
to
10
times
54
or
540
days
good
time
credit.
the
bureau's
more
complex
method
which
depends
upon
the
time
the
prisoner
actually
serves
in
prison
would
give
that
prisoner
up
to
470
days
good
time
credit
not
540
days.
ultimately
we
conclude
that
the
bureau's
method
is
right.
their
method
follows
the
statute
and
we
think
the
prisoner's
method
does
not.
thus
we
must
reject
petitioner's
simpler
method.
we
explained
all
this
in
some
detail
in
our
opinion
which
the
mathematically
inclined
may
wish
to
read.[laughter]
justice
kennedy
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
ginsburg
have
joined.
