mr.
stephen
r.
sady
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
phrase
"term
of
imprisonment"
appears
three
times
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
federal
good
time
statute.
the
first
two
times
the
parties
are
in
agreement.
"term
of
imprisonment"
means
"sentence
imposed".
the
third
use,
which
sets
the
rate
for
good
time
credit,
also
means
the
"sentence
imposed"
when
it's
used
in
the
phrase
"up
to
54
days
of
good
time
credit
towards
the
service
of
the
sentence.
"
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
exactly.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
your
honor,
that
is
a
perfect
use
of
"term
of
imprisonment"
to
mean
actual
time
and
any
good
time
credits
earned.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
and
it
uses
the
term
"release".
3624(a),
which
says
that
you
are
released
when
you
have
your
actual
time
served
and
any
good
time.
the
flaw
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
system
is
that
they
do
not
give
credit
towards
the
term
of
imprisonment
as
this
statute
in
3624(b)
dictates.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
i
respectfully
disagree
because
it
expires.
a
term
of
imprisonment,
a
ten-year
sentence,
expires.
when
you
have
311
days
10
times,
that
means
it
has
expired,
because
you
also
are
giving
those
54
days
of
good
time
credits
10
times.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
justice
alito,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
time
served
for
1
year,
but
for
the
term
of
imprisonment,
because
if
we
assume
at
the
end
of
the
365
days
that
person
has
earned
maximum
good
time
credit--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--that
he
should
receive
credit
towards
the
service
of
the
sentence.
that
means
on
the
365th
day
he
should
move
back
on
the
calendar
a
adjustment
for
good
time
and
a
reset
for
the
next
year.
that
way,
if
you
have
a
ten-year
sentence,
you
have
ten
opportunities
to--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--it
doesn't
change.
it's
still
--
the
two
components
of
a
term
of
imprisonment
are
actual
time
and
good
time
credits.
so
the
way
we
are
presenting
it
is
the
first
year
of
the
term
of
imprisonment
is
the
311
days
of
actual
service
and
the
54
days--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--that's
fine.
we
--
if
the
bureau
of
prisons
determines
that
the
person
should
receive
up
to
54
days
at
day
365,
then
they
receive
credit
towards
the
service
of
their
sentence.
that
means
moving
it
back
54
days
because
they
didn't
have
to
serve
those
days.
and
then
you
reset--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--i
do
--
do
not
think
it
changes.
i
think
that
it
is
adjusted
for
good
time,
which
is
exactly
what
congress
intended.
they
said
that
every
day,
you
get
credit
beyond
time
served.
they
use
the
phrase
"beyond
time
served"
for
credit
towards
the
service--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--justice
sotomayor,
we
are
not
asking
--
311
doesn't
have
to
be
the
magic
day
of
when
they
determine
whether
they
should
receive
it.
we
are
saying,
go
ahead,
assume
exactly
what
they
are
doing
now.
go
up
to
365
days.
but
they
do
make
a
determination.
at
that
point
of
making
the
determination,
that's
when
they
go
back
to
54
days
and
have
to
reset.
that
way
on
a
10-year
sentence
you
have
10
blocks
that
congress
intended
to
give
prisoners
to
be
able
to
earn
54
days
in
each
of
those
blocks.
now,
the
way
that
we
were
hearing
it
posited
from
justice
alito,
if
we
have
the
54
days
on
top
of
time
served
without
any
adjustment,
then
we
end
up
with
a
419-year
first
day
--
first
year,
and
you
can
only
fit
8
opportunities
to
earn
the
54
days.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
and
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--if
there
is
an
adjustment
for
good
time,
because
"term
of
imprisonment"
is
a
term
of
art
that
doesn't
mean
time
served
only.
it
can
mean--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--justice
alito,
if
i
could
refer
you
to
3621(a),
3624(a),
and
3624(b),
each
of
those
refers
--
when
they
are
talking
about
a
term
of
imprisonment,
each
refers
to
it
as
"less
good
time".
and
--
and
unless
you
do
that,
the
reason--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--exactly.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
if
you
do
that,
you
only
end
up
with
eight
opportunities
to
--
to
have
54
days.
that's
why
it's
the
difference
between
--
i
think
anybody
reading--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--we
are
going
to
--
the
rate
phrase
is:
up
to
54
days
at
the
end
of
each
year
of
the
term
of
imprisonment.
if
there
is
a
10-year
term
of
imprisonment,
that
means
there's
10
opportunities
to
earn
54
days.
the
bureau
of
prisons'
math
ends
up
with
470
days,
70
days
less.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
they
do
not
interpret
"term
of
imprisonment"
to
encompass
the
possibility
of
good
time.
that
is
the
only
--
because
you
should
have
10
blocks
of
365
days.
each
of
those
blocks,
you
may
be
able
to
get
54
days.
then
it's
311.
but
maybe
you
didn't
earn
any
time.
then
it
would
be
a
365-block.
but
the
--
actually,
the
very
good
idea
that
congress
had
was
that
you
had
an
incentive
at
every
stage
of
your
term
of
imprisonment
for
good
behavior.
even
if
you
were
misbehaving
early
in
your
prison
term,
at
the
end
you
still
have
the
opportunity
to
earn
54
days
against
that
last
365
days.
it
counts
for
every
word
in
the
statute.
it
gives
every
statute
meaning.
and
it
doesn't
put
us
in
the
position
of
giving
two
--
two
phrases
the
exact
same
meaning
in
the
same
sentence.
this
court
has
never
found
that
phrases
--
two
phrases,
uses
of
"term
of
imprisonment"
in
the
same
sentence,
mean
different
things.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
with
360--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--if
it
says
366
days,
so
that
the
year--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--then
it
--
a
360-day
sentence
would
not
be
eligible,
because
we
--
the
parties
are
agreed
that
"term
of
imprisonment"
means
a
sentence
of
more
than
a
year.
so
it
has
to
be
more
than
365
days.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
that
is
correct.
and
district
courts
frequently
address
that
problem.
when
you
have
a
relatively
short
sentence,
you
say:
judge,
could
you
give
us
--
instead
of
an
11-month
sentence,
could
you
give
us
a
year
and
a
day
sentence,
so
that
you
could
earn
the
good
time
on
that?
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
that
gets
us
to
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--he
has.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
he
has
because
of
the
last
sentence
in
3624(b)
that
says
that
for
the
last
year
or
portion
of
the
year,
that
you
go
ahead
and
establish
the
two-step
process.
first,
you
figure
out
the
projected
release
date,
which
is
a
release
date
with
maximum
good
time.
then
you
make
the
decision
about
whether
the
prisoner
should
receive
that
within
six
weeks
of
that
--
of
that
projected
release
date.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
that's
only
a
measure
when
you
make
the
determination.
they
--
they
were
recognizing
that
for
the
last
period
of
time,
or
for
a
year
and
a
day
sentence,
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
the
time
all
the
time,
but
you
will,
so
that's
why
there
is
a
special
mechanism
at
the
end.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
they
make
it
until
311
days
at
the
end
of
the
sentence,
because
what
they
do
is
they
make
the
--
they
figure
out
what
the
maximum
good
time
would
be,
which
would
be
312
days
on
a
300
and
--
on
a
year
and
a
day
sentence,
and
they
make
that
determination
earlier.
they
say,
okay,
you
have
been
good
for
that
period
of
time.
we
recognize
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
problem,
the
same
problem
you
would
have
on
a
sentence
of
10
years
and
6
months,
where
you
have
to
prorate
the
credit,
27
days
instead
of
54,
half,
and
then
figure
out
the
projected
release
date
with
180
days,
subtract
the
27
days,
and
then
make
the
determination
sometime
within
the
6
weeks
up
to
that
last
point.
so
that
there
is
a
mechanism
for
understanding
that
it
is
--
that
in
the
last
year
there
is
going
--
going
to
be
an
assumption
that
if
you
are
behaving
all
the
way
up
to
--
in
the
full
sentence
--
day
311,
you
should
get
the
full
54
days.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
our
position
is
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
can
make
its
determination
as
it
pleases.
we
--
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
--
to
construe
a
statute,
not
write
a
policy
statement.
so
we
understand
that
there
are
going
to
be
some
mechanics
of
it.
but
the
mechanics
in
this
work
very
easily
with
the
assurance
that
they
are
receiving
good
time
credit
against
the
period
of
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
judge.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
not
necessarily.
we
are
--
i'm
--
if
the
bureau
of
prisons
wants
to
make
that
determination
at
day
365,
that's
fine,
as
long
as
they
adjust
by
doing
exactly
what
the
statute
says:
credit
towards
the
service
of
the
sentence,
move
it
back
40
--
54
days,
and
then
reset.
if
you
do
that,
you
have
10
blocks
of
365
days.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
justice
breyer,
i
think
it
doesn't
make
sense,
because
what
it
does
is
it
creates
an
87.2
minimum
sentence
that
is
served,
and
we
note
that
the
sentencing
table
upon
which
every
federal
sentence
is
predicated
is
based
on
85
percent.
that
being--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--your
honor,
we
are
relying
very
heavily
on
the
supplemental
report
at
--
at
page
140
of
the
joint
appendix
that
says
we
--
we
divide
it
by.85
in
order
to
calibrate
the
sentencing
table
to
include
good
time.
that
means
that
every
sentence
has
been
calibrated
based
on
assuming
10
opportunities
to
earn
54
days,
which--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--that
is
their
position.
and
our
position
is
that
it's
--
administering
the
statute
is
the
bureau
of
prisons's
business,
but
deciding
what
the
minimum
sentence
that
can
--
minimum
time
that
can
be
served
to
satisfy
a
term
of
imprisonment
is
a
policy
decision,
and
that
the
policy
is
properly
placed--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--i
think
that
the
court
could
be
advised
by
it
in
terms
of
knowing
that
we
are
looking
at
a
harsher
sentence.
everybody
is
serving
more
time
than
--
the
sentence
that
the
judge
imposed
was
--
whether
it
was
advisory
guidelines
or
mandatory
guidelines,
the
sentencing
table
provided
the
initial
baseline.
and
that
initial
baseline
was
boosted
by
2.2
percent,
which
is
not
an
insignificant
amount,
and
there
is
a
very
simple
way
for
the
court
to
construe
the
statute
consistently
throughout
to
conform
the
two,
so
that
people
are
not
serving
2.2
percent
more
time
in
custody
than
the
sentencing
table
that
every
judge
uses
in
imposing
their
sentence.
we
are
institutionalizing
a
harsher
system
in
a
way
that
doesn't
meet
the
statutory
language,
because
the
statutory
language
says
"term
of
imprisonment".
and
if
it's
term
of
imprisonment,
10
years
of
a
term
of
imprisonment,
i
think
a
reasonable
plain
meaning
is
that
you
have
10
opportunities
to
earn
54
days.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
approximately
200,000
prisoners,
and
of
those
about
195,000
of
them
are
eligible
for
good
time
credits.
my
anecdotal
experience
is
that
most
prisoners
get
most
of
the
--
the
good
time
credits,
so
it's
not
at
all
unusual
for
prisoners
to
achieve
most
of
that.
there
is
some
that
have
minor
amounts,
and
there
is
a
relatively
smaller
number,
at
least
in
my
experience,
who
do
not
get
a
lot
of
it.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
yes,
the
419--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
each
year
is
served
in
the
--
if
you
take
away
the
54
days,
if
you
credit
it
towards
the
service
of
the
sentence
and
do
the
adjustment
and
reset
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
so
that
you
have
10
opportunities,
then
in
the
last
year,
you
are
--
when
you
are
in
--
you
go
to
the
last
sentence
that
acknowledges
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
make
some
arbitrary
time
that
you
are
going
to,
say,
okay,
we
are
going
to
decide
that
you
have
done
well
enough
that
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
the
full
credit
for
the
last
year.
but
the
flaw
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
by
having
the
54
days
and
actual
time
and
that
that's
what
happens
at
the
first
year,
that's
a
419-day
first
year.
you
can
only
squeeze
8
of
those
in.
the
prisoners
look
at
it
and
they
see,
plain
statute,
what
was
your
term
of
imprisonment,
how
many
ends
of
each
year
of
a
term
of
imprisonment
should
you
have
in
a
10-year
sentence.
ten
years.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
the
bureau
of
prisons
probably
has
discretion
in
administering.
i'm
accepting
as
a
proposition
on
the
day
365
they
make
that
determination.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
that's
--
that's
when
they
are
making
the
determination.
if
they
make
a
determination
that
he
is
--
should
receive
credit,
then
the
end
of
the
first
year
becomes
day
311,
because
he
has
received--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--311.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
no.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
the
meaning
of
that
language
is
day
3--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--excuse
me.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
it
depends.
and
the
reason
it
depends
is
because
the
language
of
the
statute
says
"credit
toward
the
service
of
the
prisoner's
sentence
beyond
time
served.
"
so
if
you
do
it
beyond
time
served
and
you
give
him
credit
towards
that
sentence
--
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
making
a
determination.
once
we
--
they
make
their
determination,
and
we
respect
that
determination,
we
then
have
to
go
--
from
the
365th
day,
back,
because
for
54
of
those
days
he
doesn't
have
to
be
there.
he
has
earned
that
time
and
you
can--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--adjust
and
reset
at
the
next
365.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
no.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
yes,
that
is
--
that
is
certainly
one
way
of
mechanically
doing
it
so
that
you
have
10
blocks
of
365
days
each
as
a
term
of
imprisonment.
because
term
of--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--yes.
[laughter]
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
no,
absolutely
not.
their
--
their
system
makes
--
nobody
can
understand
the
math.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
yes.
there
was
a
technical
amendment.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
to
address
that
first
year,
to
make
sure
that
they
did
that.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
exactly.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--when
it
was
at
36
days.
and
it's
interesting,
so
page
56
of
the
--
of
the
senate
report
on
this,
they
used
the
term
"adjust
for
good
time".
now
that
--
then
it
was
36
days.
but
congress
was
using
exact
same
thought
as
the
language
here
that
says
that
the
time
is
--
that
you
give
credit
towards
the
service
of
a
sentence.
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
thank
you.
the
--
the
idea
that
there
could
be
time
at
the
end
of
the
sentences
is
premised
on
"term
of
imprisonment"
mean
"time
served",
which
it
cannot
mean
in
the
same
sentence
where
it
says
"beyond
time
served".
if
you
make
the
adjustment
for
good
time
credit
that
is
earned
at
the
end
of
the
year,
it
is
credit
towards
the
service
of
the
sentence;
that
means
that
it's
blocks
of
365
days,
that
at
the
last
day
of
mr.
barber's
sentence
if
it's
properly
computed,
he
would
be
looking
at
365
days.
if
he
behaved
well
until
close
to
the
end,
if
we
go
to
the
last
statute
that
says
prorate
the
remaining
period
of
time,
the
30
--
remaining
36
days
he
could
earn,
and
credit
it
in
the
last
6
weeks,
because
they
are
doing
that
simply
as
an
administrative
technique.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
355.
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
right.
and
so
the
355--
[laughter]
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
365,
and
if
he
behaves
very
badly
he
has
to
go
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
that
365
and
doesn't
get
any
adjustment,
but
if
he
--
next
year
he
starts
all
over
again
for
365
days,
and
if
he
is
very
good
he
gets
the
54
days.
if
i
could
address
the
question
that
was
raised
by
justice
ginsburg
on
the
rule
of
lenity.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
--
we
have
relied
on
both
r.l.c.
and
in
--
on
granderson
for
your
articulation
of
the
rule
of
lenity
as
it
would
apply
in
this
case.
which,
if
after
we're
looking
at
all
the
other
--
the
statute,
the
history,
the
context,
and
if
we
cannot
--
if
we
apply
the
rule
of
lenity,
if
the
government's
position
cannot
be
shown
to
be
unambiguously
correct,
we
have
at
least
ambiguity
here,
and
then
we
go
to
chief
justice
marshall's
seminal
discussion
of
lenity.
and
what
he
said
was
that
we
look
at
lenity
for
the
proposition
--
to
back
the
principle
that
the
power
of
punishment
belongs
to
the
legislative
department;
and
the
tenderness
of
the
law
for
the
rights
of
individuals,
both
of--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--the
court
in
--
in
lynce
and
in
weaver
used
the
term
"increase
in
punishment"
when
there
was
no
longer
available
good
time
credits.
for
--
to
say
that
somebody
has
to
serve
87.2
percent
of
the
term
of
imprisonment
imposed
by
the
judge
instead
of
85
percent,
that
is
imprisonment.
for
mr.
barber
that's
over
6
months'
additional
time
behind
bars
in
a
prison.
that's
--
that's
penal;
that
is
affecting
individual
liberty,
it's
the
type
of
liberty
that
was
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
rule
of
lenity;
and
especially
in
the
situation
where
the
initial
sentence
was
imposed
based
on
a
grid
that
was
calibrated
assuming
85
percent,
he's
ending
up
serving
2.2
percent
more
time
than
the
sentencing
judge,
in
imposing
the
sentence.
so
that
aspect
of
punishment.
and
in
actual
raw
time
behind
bars
in
a
prison.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
my--
mr.
stephen
r.
sady
--thank
you.
