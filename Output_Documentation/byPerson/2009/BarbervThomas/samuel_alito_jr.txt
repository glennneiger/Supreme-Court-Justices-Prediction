justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why
isn't
the
term
of
imprisonment
most
reasonably
understood
to
mean
the
term
that
is
imposed
viewed
at
the
time
when
it
is
imposed?
so
that
if
someone
is
sentenced
to
a
term
of
360
days,
5
years,
and
begins
serving
his
sentence
on
january
1st,
year
1
of
the
term
imposed
ends
on
december
31st
of
that
year;
year
2
of
the
term
imposed
begins
on
january
1st
of
the
following
year,
and
so
forth.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
hang
on.
i
understand
what
you
are
arguing,
but
i
don't
understand
why
the
term
of
imprisonment
changes.
we
look
at
the
--
we
look
at
the
term
of
the
imprisonment
on
the
day
when
it
is
imposed
and
the
day
when
the
defendant
begins
serving
the
sentence,
and
you
can
say:
year
one
ends
at
the
end
of
2010;
year
two
ends
at
the
end
of
2011.
why
do
you
think
that
the
term
--
the
phrase
"term
of
imprisonment"
has
to
change
as
--
the
understanding
of
the
"term
of
imprisonment"
has
to
change
as
the
prisoner
progresses
in
serving
the
sentence?
i
totally
fail
to
understand
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
don't
know
whether
that
--
you
don't
know
whether
that
prisoner
is
going
to
be
eligible
for
the
54
days
until
the
365
days
are
over.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
where
you
get
that
--
i'm
not
sure
where
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute.
but
i
still
don't
think
you
have
answered
my
question.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
it
too
much.
on
the
day
when
the
prisoner
in
my
hypothetical
begins
serving
his
sentence,
if
you
said,
when
will
your
first
year
of
imprisonment
--
first
year
of
your
term
of
imprisonment
end?
you
would
say
december
31st,
2010.
when
will
the
second
year
of
the
term
of
imprisonment
end?
december
31st,
2011.
that's
what
you
would
have
to
say
at
that
point,
because
you
don't
know
whether
the
prisoner
will
earn
any
good
time
credits.
so
why
do
you
think
that
the
meaning
of
the
year
of
the
term
of
imprisonment
changes
as
the
sentence
goes
on?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
not
at
all.
no.
at
the
end
of
--
at
the
end
of
2010,
in
my
hypothetical,
you
would
take
the
54
days
off
the
end,
just
as
justice
sotomayor
suggested.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
--
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
service
doesn't
--
your
--
your
argument
is
predicated
on
the
idea
that
service
of
year
two
begins
on
the
311th
day.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
don't
understand
that.
i
will
not
belabor
it.
i
don't
understand
why
the
parties
have
spent
so
much
time
sparring
over
that
issue,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
totally
unnecessary
and
irrelevant.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
statute
says
that
it
is
--
the
credit,
it
can
be
received,
quote,
at
the
end
of
each
year
of
the
prisoner's
term
of
imprisonment
beginning
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
the
term.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
when
does
--
when
is
that
point,
in
your
opinion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
so
the
--
day
365
is
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
--
of
the
term
of
imprisonment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
statute
says
that
they
--
that
the
prisoner
may
receive
credit
at
the
end
of
each
year
of
the
prisoner's
term
of
imprisonment
beginning
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
the
term.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
i'm
asking
is,
when
is
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
the
term
within
the
meaning
of
that
language?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
day
3--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--is
it
day
365,
or
is
it
day
311?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
understand
them
to
be
saying
that.
i
understood
them
to
be
saying
that
the
determination
could
be
made
at
the
end
of
365
days,
but
if
it's
determined
that
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
54
days
of
credit,
then
year
1
should
be
regarded
as
having
begun
on
the
312th
day,
rather
than
the
366th
day.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
they
would
say
you
won't
know
when
the
second
year
has
begun
until
the
full
calendar
year
has
been
completed.
