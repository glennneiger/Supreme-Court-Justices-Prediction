justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
do
with
--
if
--
it's
a
very
short
sentence?
a
year
and
a
day,
in
your
view,
is
a
year
and
a
day
less
54.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
360
days,
what
do
you
do
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
if
--
suppose
it's
for
--
just
--
the
whole
sentence
is
360
days.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
360.
in
other
words,
short
of
a
year.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
person
that
gets
a
year
and
a
day
serves
less
than
the
person
that
gets
less
than
a
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
each
of
those
4
years
included
54
days
of
credit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
are
just
not
vested
until
the
year
has
--
the
full
year
has
passed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
use
it
just
in
the
calculating
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
--
if
we
disagree
with
that,
if
we
disagree
that
the
bop
has
authority
in
this
area,
then
--
as
justice
ginsburg's
question,
i
think,
suggests
--
does
not
the
rule
of
lenity
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
do
you
explain
the
granderson
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
granderson
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
thought
that
in
that
case,
justice
ginsburg,
for
this
court,
established
the
proposition
that
the
rule
of
lenity
is
applicable.
i
know
it
wasn't
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
either.
that
was
a
parole
revocation
case.
but
in
--
in
any
event,
the
--
shouldn't
the
rule
of
lenity
apply?
if
the
rule
of
lenity
is
thought
of
as
a
notice
requirement
insofar
as
giving
you
warning
to
what
conduct
is
punishable,
that's
one
thing,
but
doesn't
the
rule
of
lenity
mean
more
than
that?
it's
a
check
against
the
power
of
the
state,
so
that
you
simply
mitigate
the
--
the
power
of
the
state
in
favor
of
the
individual.
in
a
case
like
this,
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
granderson
case
is
cited
in
the
brief
for
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers,
and
as
i
read
it,
it
applies
to
this
area
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
ought
to.
i
mean,
you
tell
us
this
is
not
a
criminal
statute.
i
--
i
certainly
think
it
has
--
it
has
all
the
impact
and
force
of
the
state
detaining
a
person
for
a
criminal
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
cumulated--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
what
--
what
we
were
--
what
we
were
saying,
is
this
is
36,000
years
of
prisoner
time,
i
mean
--
36,000,
that
is
older
than
marbury
versus
madison.
