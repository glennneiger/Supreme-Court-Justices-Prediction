mr.
sady,
you
--
you
said
something
about
15
percent
or
85
percent
is
a
more
workable
system
than
--
was
it
12.9
percent?
do
we
have
any
information
on,
(a),
the
number
of
federal
prisoners
who
get
good
time
and
in
that
universe,
the
ones
who
get
good
time,
how
many
get
the
full
credit
and
how
many
get
something
less
than
the
full
54
days?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wall,
the
--
if
we
consider
both
methods
plausible,
the
number
comes
out
at
15
percent
--
85
percent,
15
percent.
it's
a
more
workable
number,
and
there
are
some
groups
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
thought
85
percent,
not
87.2
or
whatever
it
is.
so
in
choosing
between
those
two
methods,
why
not
take
the
easier
number
to
work
with?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
disagree
with
your
colleague
that
that
is
the
case
most
of
the
time,
that
most
federal
prisoners
get
good
time
credit,
and
of
the
ones
who
get
credit,
most
of
them
get
the
full
54
days?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
argument
--
one
of
the
arguments
is
it
is
not
punishment
at
all.
this
is
a
reward;
this
is
a
reward
for
good
behavior.
