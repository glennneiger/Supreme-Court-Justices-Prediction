justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
--
perhaps
i
can,
if
you
will
permit
me,
rephrase
justice
alito's
question
in
sort
of
the
more
simplistic
way
i
looked
at
it.
why
is
it
that
we
have
to
do
the
calculation
that
you're
talking
about,
which
is
start
at
311
days
and
take
back
days,
which
makes
no
sense
to
me,
or
their
very
complicated
ten-page
number?
why
can't
they
just
take
54
days
at
the
end
of
every
year
that
there
is
actual
service,
and
that
the
time
served,
plus
whatever
number
of
days
have
been
earned,
you
subtract
it
from
the
term
of
imprisonment?
so
if
he
was
imprisoned
for
10
years,
he
got
540
days
for
whatever
it
is.
at
the
end
of
the
9th
year,
he
made
up
whatever
--
you
added
up
9
times
54,
and
you
took
it
away
from
10.
he
serves
9
and
that.
that
would
make
sense
of
"beyond
the
time
served"
language
that's
in
this
provision.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
do
you
do
it
if
you
take
(a),
and
(a)
says:
a
prisoner
shall
be
released
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
on
the
date
of
the
expiration
of
the
prisoner's
term
of
imprisonment
--
10
years,
we
are
assuming,
an
imprisonment
--
less
any
time
credited
towards
the
service
of
the
prisoner's
sentence,
as
provided
in
subsection
(b).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
each
year
that
he
served,
you
add
up
the
number
of
days
he
has
served,
the
good
time
credit,
and
you
subtract
them
from
the
120
months
that
you
have
given
him,
and
you
figure
out
when
he's
going
to
get
out.
you
work
backwards,
not
forward,
the
way
everyone
seems
to
be
doing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
the
way
the
language
is
written.
so
i
mean
you
may
want
the
greater
opportunity,
but
it
says
by
its
explicit
phrase:
terms:
at
the
date
of
the
prisoner's
--
expiration
of
the
prisoner's
term
of
imprisonment,
take
that
day
and
subtract
from
it
time
credited
towards
the
service
of
the
prisoner's
sentence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
then
what
do--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
the
next
year--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
start
it
at
311?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
he
now
serves
another
year
and
you
back
him
up
again
at
the
end
of
that
year?
to
300--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
you
--
and
you
think
that
their
system
is
easier?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
their
system
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
a
premise
flaw
there.
and
that
premise
flaw
is
that
you
have
told
us
that
you
don't
earn
the
credit
until
the
end
of
the
year.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
answer
about
this
probation
is
not
an
answer,
because
it's
--
your
premise
is
not
the
same.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
worried
about
sentences
that
are
more
than
2
years.
i'm
worried
about
the
prisoner
who
is
sentenced
to
a
year
and
a
day.
how
does
that
proration
help
that
individual,
since
they
are
not
going
to
get
the
good
time
credit
until
they've
served
a
year?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
what
i'm
saying
to
you.
the
whole
brief
says
to
us,
they
measure
the
entitlement
to
good
time
credit
at
the
end
of
the
first
year.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
is
not
going
to
get
54
days?
he's
going
to
get--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
just
want
to
make
absolutely
sure
because
i
hadn't
done
the
math
forward;
i
did
the
math
backwards.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
was
the
one
that
justice
breyer
and
justice
alito
set
forth--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
is
54
days
are
earned
back
for
each
year,
and
you
take
it
off
the
full
term
of
imprisonment.
the
--
you
are
representing
to
me
that
the
math
that
is
in
your
program
statement
is
accomplishing
that
result?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
this
explanation
that
has
been
given
in
your
brief
and
the
one
you
are
giving
to
us
now
as
to
why
bop
chose
what
it
did,
is
there
any
statement
outside
of
the
penned
affidavit
that
explains
why
this
choice
was
made?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
in
each
one
of
them
they
have
taken
the
position
that
the
statute
was
unambiguous.
assuming
that
that
is
not
accepted
by
us,
that
it's
ambiguous,
what
and
where
are
we
giving
chevron
or
skidmore
deference
to
what
set
of
facts
or
to
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
did
they
exercise
discretion
when
they
took
the
position
that
it
was
unambiguous?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
have
never
given
deference,
have
we,
to
an
affidavit
submitted
in
litigation
to
explain
something
that
on
its
face
is
not
explained
either
in
an
agency's
regulation
or
in
its
policy
statement
that
--
that
--
this
is
giving
deference
to
an
affidavit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
so
--
in
your
system
they
do
the
measurement
at
the
end
of
the
365
days.
he
misbehaves
on
the
340th
day.
and
they
say
for
that
reason,
i'm
only
going
to
give
you
10
days
of
full
time
--
of
good
time
credit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
your
year
starts
at
350?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
they
said
they
are
only
giving
you
10
days
of
good
time
credit.
because
at
the
end
of
--
355.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
was
pretty
bad.
[laughter]
355.
now,
your
year
starts
again
on
355
days--
