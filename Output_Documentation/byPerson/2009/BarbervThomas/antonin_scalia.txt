but
it
doesn't
always
mean
that.
i
think
you
say
somewhere
in
your
brief
that
it
always
means
that.
it
surely
does
not
always
mean
that.
because
in
--
what
is
it,
3624
--
wait
a
minute,
now.
3624(d)
says
that,
"upon
the
release
of
a
prisoner
on
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
imprisonment,
the
bureau
of
prisons
shall
give
him
clothes,
money
and
transportation.
"
now
there
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
imprisonment
does
not
mean
the
--
the
assigned
term
of
imprisonment.
it
means
the
assigned
term
of
imprisonment
less
all
the
good
time
credits
he
has
had.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you
think
they
are
supposed
to
give
him
his
clothes,
you
know,
several
months
after
he
leaves.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
addressing
that.
all
i'm
--
look,
it
--
the
text
says
"upon
the
release
of
a
prisoner
on
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
imprisonment.
"
my
only
point
is
that
that
--
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
that
is
a
use
of
the
phrase
"term
of
imprisonment"
that
does
not
mean
the
sentence
he
was
given,
but
rather
means
the
sentence
that
he
served.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
earn
the
good
time?
i
mean
you
only
earn
the
good
time
if
--
if
you
are
a
good
prisoner
for
a
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
going
to
let
him
out
54
days
before
the
year,
even
though
he
hasn't
earned
the
good
time
in
the
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
he
do?
how
has
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
government
contends
it's
none
of
the
sentencing
commission's
business.
it's
up
to
the
bureau
of
prisons.
isn't
that
the
government's
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
you
don't
measure
--
i
don't
think
that
--
you
--
you
begin
measuring
on
311,
but
you
measure
365
days
from
--
from
311.
and
if
he
has
behaved
well
during
all
--
all
of
those
365
days,
then
you
knock
off
another
51
days
or
whatever
it
is.
and
you
begin
the
third
year
from
then,
but
you
give
him
another
365
days
to
determine
whether
he
has
behaved
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
did.
you
didn't
give
him
the
credit
until
he
served
the
whole
365
days.
at
that
point,
he
gets
the
credit
and
you
count
the
second
year
as
though
it
begins
on
day
311.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
they're
not
taking
it
off
from
the
back
end.
they
are
taking
it
off
from
the
next
year.
so
that
in
the
second
year,
if
he
--
if
he
behaves
well
for
365
days
from
311
--
okay?
he
behaves
well
for
the
next
365
days.
the
next
year
will
begin
at
622.
but
then
he
has
to
serve
another
365
days
before
he
gets
good
time
credit.
and
then
the
next
year
will
begin
three
times
311:
933.
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
right?
see,
he
agrees
with
me.
[laughter]
no,
i'm
not
saying
that's
right.
i'm
just
saying
that
that's
--
that
is
what
he
is
proposing.
justice
antonin
scalia
subsequent
legislative
history,
so
to
speak,
right?
[laughter]
i
mean,
we
--
we
wouldn't
allow
that
--
those
of
us
who
use
legislative
history
don't
allow
a
congressman
to
come
in
several
years
after
the
bill
has
passed
and
say,
oh,
by
the
way,
the
reason
we
voted
for
that
is
thus
and
such.
we
would
kick
that
out.
why
is
it
any
different
for
an
agency's
subsequent
statement?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
we
sent
cases
back
under
overton
park
for
an
agency's
description
of
history.
i
think
we
sent
it
back
for
the
agency
to
give
a
reason
for
its
rule,
whether
that's
its
current
reason
or
its
past
reason.
it
--
it's
the
current
reason
that
counts.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
me.
[laughter]
i'm
--
i'm
willing
to
accept
the
--
the
government's
assertion
here
that
that's
the
government's
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you
are
lying.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
justice
breyer
has
got
it
!
whoa
!
[laughter]
