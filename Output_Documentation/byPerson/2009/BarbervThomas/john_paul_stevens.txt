justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
still
couldn't
give
him
the
full
54
days,
because
there's
only
42
days
in
six
weeks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
saying
the
special
mechanism
can't
give
the
full
54
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
don't
make
it
until
42
days
before
the
end
of
the
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
question?
if
he
got
a
total
of
540
or
whatever
it
is,
he
should
never
enter
the
9th
year
because
he
would
finish
the
10-year
sentence
in
less
than
8
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
less
than
9
years,
rather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
how
does
he
--
how
does
he
get
his
10th
block
of
good
time?
how
does
he
ever
get
it
under
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
i
understand.
but
explain
to
me
how
--
how
he
can
get
more
than
a
year
of
good
time
credit
before
the
10th
year
begins?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
more
than
a
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
as
justice
scalia
says,
you
know,
you
do
make
the
determination
on
the
365th
day,
but
what
you
determine
is
that
the
--
having
been
a
good
prisoner,
his
first
year
expired
54
days
earlier,
and
then
you
start
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
and
get
one
thing
off
my
mind
that
i
just
--
supposing
he
misbehaves
in
year
3.
does
that
just
affect
his
good
time
credits
in
year
3,
or
does
it
mean
he
is
canceled
for
years
1
and
2?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
can
lose
his
108
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
isn't
there
another
consideration?
it's
not
the
rule
of
lenity,
but
it's
something
else
we
should
take
into
account.
in
the
--
in
their
reply
brief,
they
say
it
costs
about
25
or
$26,000
to
house
a
particular
prisoner,
and
the
number
of
prisoners
involved
is
--
something
like
$100
million
in
taxpayers'
money
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
it
--
is
--
you
don't
disagree
with
that
general
figure,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
any
event,
it's
clear
it's
a
lot
of
money.
and
--
and
is
that
not
a
factor
that
we
should
be
aware
of
in
this
case,
because,
all
other
things
being
equal
--
assume
the
statute
is
totally
ambiguous,
and
if
you
--
if
one
--
one
--
one
version
will
save
the
--
the
government
$100
million
a
year
and
the
other
version
will
cost
it,
is
that
--
isn't
that
a
factor
we
--
we
should
take
into
consideration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
there
are
195,000
sentences
affected
by
this
rule.
i
don't
know
which
way
that
cuts.
if
there
are
195,000
people
spending
more
time
in
--
you
know,
significantly
more
time
in
jail
than
they
should,
that's
kind
of
troublesome.
justice
john
paul
stevens
probably
they
didn't
understand
it
because
it's
an
awfully
hard
statute
to
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he's
a
lot
smarter
than
i
am.
