mr.
friedman,
one
of
the
problems
that
has
been
brought
up
is
that
this
is
an
inordinate
expense,
and
you're
wasting
the
time
of
the
analyst.
do
you
recognize
any
economy
--
for
example,
that
the
analyst
could
testify
from
the
lab,
have
video
conferencing,
and
so
the
analyst,
while
the
prosecutor
must
call
her,
can
testify
from
the
lab
instead
of
coming
down
to
the
courthouse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
in
your
view,
it
wouldn't
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause
if,
say,
the
supervisor
shows
up
and
said
that
this
is
--
this
is
the
way
the
analysts
operate
and
describes
the
procedures.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
have
to
happen
in
the
prosecutor's
case.
in
other
words,
the
prosecutor
puts
in
the
reports
and
rests.
and
the
defendant
says,
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence;
i
move
to
dismiss
the
case.
it
couldn't
be
dismissed
at
that
point.
the
prosecutor
would
prove
its
case
by
the
affidavit
alone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
the
proper
solution
to
grant,
vacate,
and
remand
in
light
of
melendez-diaz?
