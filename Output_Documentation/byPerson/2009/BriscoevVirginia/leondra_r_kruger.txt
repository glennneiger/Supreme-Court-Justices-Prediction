ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
state
adequately
safeguards
the
confrontation
right
recognized
in
melendez-diaz
when
it
guarantees
that
it
will,
on
the
defendant's
request,
bring
the
analyst
into
court
for
face-to-face
confrontation
and
cross-examination
at
trial.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
melendez-diaz--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
justice
scalia,
not
at
all.
we
believe
that
a
state
complies
with
that
very
rule
from
melendez-diaz
when
it
ensures
that
the
analyst
is
present
in
court
to
submit
to
cross-examination,
which
is
the
core
of
the
confrontation
right.
this
court
affirmed
in
its
decision--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that's
right,
and
that's
--
that's
because--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--this
court
has
recognized
that
the
confrontation
right
is
designed
to
achieve
a
particular
purpose,
and
that
is
to
ensure
that
the
government's
evidence
is
subject
to
adversarial
testing
at
trial.
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
defendant
in
every
case
to
decide,
no
matter
how
the
prosecution
presents
its
evidence
on
direct,
whether
or
not
it
wants
to
confront
the
witness
and
submit
that
witness's
testimony
to
adversarial
testing--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
it
would
be
surprising
to
discover
that
melendez-diaz
went
quite
so
far.
this
court
has
never
before
recognized
a
dimension
of
the
confrontation
clause
that
would
govern
the
manner
in
which
the
prosecution
presents
its
evidence,
except
for
the
rule
that
it
affirmed
it
in
crawford,
which
is
that
so
long
as
the
government
ensures
that
the
witness
is
available
for
cross-examination
at
trial,
the
confrontation
clause
places
no
constraints
on
the
government's
use
of
prior
testimony
or
statements.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
the
statement
is
it
requires
only
that
the
court
reaffirm
what
it
already
said
in
crawford,
in
the
context
of
the
lab
analyst
testimony
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
is,
again,
when
the
analyst
is
available
for
cross-examination
at
trial,
the
government
has
complied
with
what
the
confrontation
clause
demands.
it
has
provided
a
constitutionally
sufficient
opportunity
for
the
defendants
to
submit
that
analyst's
findings
to
adversarial
testing--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
our
principal
submission
is
that
the
confrontation
clause
provides,
in
every
case,
an
opportunity
for
effective
cross-examination.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
and
there
may
be
independent
constraints
on
the
manner
in
which
the
prosecution
presents
its
evidence
under
the
laws
of
evidence
in
the
jurisdiction
because
of
the
government's
need
to
satisfy
its
burden
of
proof
and
ensure
a
fundamentally
fair
trial
under
the
due
process
clause.
to
the
extent
that
the
court--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
it
is
to
say
that
confrontation
clause
is
not
what
prohibits
that
practice.
what
prohibits
that
practice
are
other
equally
effective
sources
in
the
law--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
that's
right,
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
that
submission,
this
court
could
rely
on
the
kinds
of
distinctions
that
it
has
drawn
in
other
cases,
like
inadi
or
like
white
v.
illinois,
which
recognized
that
there
is
a
class
of
hearsay
evidence
that's
not
simply
a
weaker
substitute
for
live
testimony
at
trial,
that
has
independent,
probative
significance
that
makes
it
somewhat
irrelevant
whether
or
not
the
court--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
it's
not
a
question
of
the
reliability.
what
crawford
did
was
replace
a
system
in
which
hearsay
evidence
and
its
admissibility
was
dependent
on
reliability
with
one
in
which
the
touchstone
is
an
opportunity
for
cross-examination.
and
it's
precisely
in
response
to
that
point
that
crawford,
again,
reaffirmed
the
rule
that
it
first
announced
in
green,
that
so
long
as
the
out-of-court
declarant
is
present
at
trial
to
explain
or
defend
his
out-of-court
statements,
the
confrontation
clause
is
satisfied.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
but--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
don't
think
that
the
touchstone
of
this
court's
analysis
need
return
to
the
now
discredited
ohio
v.
roberts
regime.
it's
simply
a
practical
point.
to
the
extent
the
petitioners
are
arguing
that
their
opportunity
to
confront
and
to
cross-examine
is
constitutionally
inadequate
merely
because
the
prosecution
hasn't
guaranteed
that
it
would
call
the
witness
to
the
stand
first,
i
think
the
court
can
take
due
account
of
the
fact
that
that
is
not
necessarily
so.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
were
otherwise
inclined
to
invent
a
new
body
of
confrontation
clause
jurisprudence
to
govern
the
manner
in
which
the
prosecution
puts
on
its
witnesses
and
questions
them,
this
isn't
the
appropriate
case
to
do
it
because,
as
we
have
seen
from
petitioners'
submission
earlier
this
morning,
there
is
no
substantive
difference
from
a
defendant's
perspective--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--our
principal
submission
is
that
the
confrontation
clause
allows
the
government
to
rely
on
affidavits,
so
long
as
it
bring
the
affiants
into
court,
so
that
the
defendant
can
ask
whatever
questions--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that
is
our
principal--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--we
do
think
that
there
are
constitutional
limits
in
the
due
process
clause,
and
it's
guaranteeing
the
right
to--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
it's
--
it's
somewhat
of
a
difficult
question
to
answer
because
this
is
not
a
question
that
arises
particularly
frequently.
the
laws
of
evidence,
as
a
general
matter,
express
a
strong
preference
for
the
prosecution
to
present
its
evidence
through
live
testimony--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
it's
difficult
to
imagine
that
a
new-found
constitutional
rule
that
would
require
the
prosecution
to
present
its
evidence
in
a
certain
way
in
every
case
would
lead
to
that
sort
of
clarity.
it
would,
if
anything,
create--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--we
think
that
you
could,
so
long
as
the
defendant
has
an
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine
that
eye
witness
about
the
testimonial
statement.
but
even
if
you
disagreed
with
that,
we
think
that
the
court
can
take
due
account
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
kind
of
testimony
that
an
eyewitness
provides
and
the
kind
of
testimony
that
a
forensic
analyst
provides.
the
forensic
analyst's
lab
report
is
not
merely
a
weaker
substitute
for
live
testimony.
it
is,
in
fact,
i
think,
as
we
see
by
the
relative
infrequency
with
which
analysts
were
called
into
court
before
melendez-diaz,
something
that
has
been
seen
to
have
equal
value,
regardless
of
the
manner
in
which
it's
presented.
and,
for
that
reason,
we
think
that,
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
all
this
court
needs
to
decide
is
that,
in
the
context
of
forensic
lab
analysts,
what
the
court
said
in
crawford
still
stands,
so
long
as
the
government
presents
the
analyst
at
trial
for
face-to-face
confrontation
and
cross-examination.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that's
true,
and
i
think
that
that's
because
virginia
was
unwilling
to
stake
the
validity
of
however
many
convictions
in
the
interim
on
the
outcome
of
a
case.
but
this--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
this
--
this
case
presents,
i
think,
an
important
opportunity
for
the
court
to
provide
guidance
to
states
that
are
currently
grappling
with
how
to
respond
to
the
practical
problems
that
have
been
presented
in
the
wake
of
melendez-diaz.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
don't
mean
to
quibble,
justice
sotomayor,
but
the
statute
does
not
in
fact
on
its
face
say
the
defendant
must
subpoena.
it
says
the
witness
shall
be
summoned.
but
i
think
to
the
extent
that
you
had
any
questions
about
whether
or
not
the
commonwealth's
interpretation
of
that
language
were
correct,
the
appropriate
course
would
be
to
remand
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
to
allow
them
to
address
that
question
of
state
law
in
the
first
instance.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
thank
you,
your
honor.
