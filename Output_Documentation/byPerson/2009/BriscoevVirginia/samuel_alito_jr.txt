justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
clear
to
me
what
your
answer
to
these
questions
is.
if
all
the
prosecution
does
is
call
the
analyst
on
the
stand
and
admit
--
have
the
analyst
provide
a
foundation
for
the
admission
of
the
report,
let's
say,
pursuant
to
the
hearsay
exception
for
recorded
recollection,
and
does
nothing
more,
would
there
be
a
confrontation
clause
problem?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
in
which
the
report
is
--
is
admitted,
subject
to
--
and
the
analyst
is
available,
and
the
defense
can
question
the
analyst
if
the
defense
wishes
to?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
you
say
that?
we
have
an
amicus
brief
from
26
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia
arguing
exactly
the
contrary.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
say
that
there
is
a
very
substantial
category
of
cases
in
which
defendants
really
have
no
interest
whatsoever
in
contesting
either
the
nature
or
the
quantity
of
drugs
involved,
but
they
will
refuse
to
stipulate
to
those
things
simply
for
the
purpose
of
putting
a
financial
burden
on
the
prosecution,
because
they
know,
if
they
do
that,
it
may
be
helpful
for
them
in
getting
a
better
plea
bargain,
plus
there
is
a
certain
risk
that
the
analyst
will
not
show
up,
and
they
will
get
the
benefit
of
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
is
not
a
burden
on
these
26
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia,
why
are
they
bothering
to
make
this
argument?
just
for
amusement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
does
that
square
with
where
we
started
out?
we
have
situation
a,
where
the
prosecutor
calls
the
lab
analyst,
and
the
lab
analyst
says,
this
is
my
report,
and
i
stand
by
it,
period.
now,
it's
up
to
the
defense
to
cross-examine.
that's
situation
a.
situation
b
is
the
report
is
admitted
without
the
analyst
present,
but
the
defense
can
then
--
without
the
analyst
on
the
stand--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
the
defense
can
then
cross-examine
the
analyst.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there's
such
a
slight
difference
between
those
two
situations.
now,
how
is
that
a
fundamental
transformation
of
the
way
anglo-american
trials
are
conducted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
let's
just
not
get
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
all
--
all
that
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
--
an
analyst's
report
relating
to
the
--
the
nature
of
the
substance
that
was
tested
and,
if
it's
a
controlled
substance,
the
amount.
that's
it.
it
doesn't
extend
to
anything
else,
videotapes
or
anything
more.
there's
such
a
slight
difference
between
those
two
situations.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
take
it
your
position
is
it
wouldn't
matter.
if
the
--
if
virginia
said
that
the
--
the
commonwealth
bears
the
risk
of
a
no-show,
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
we
have
to
assume
that
that's
the
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
would
you
like
us--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--would
you
like
us
to
grant,
vacate,
and
remand
in
this
case
and
say
because
it's
unclear
who
has
the
risk
of
a
no-show?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
then
supreme
court
of
virginia
on
remand
could
decide
whether
in
fact
the
--
the
prosecution
bore
that
risk?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
melendez-diaz
addressed
the
question
of
the
order
of
proof?
where
did
it
address
that?
