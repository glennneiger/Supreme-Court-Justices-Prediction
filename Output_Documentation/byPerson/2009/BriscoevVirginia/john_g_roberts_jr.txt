justice

g.
roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-11191,
briscoe
v.
virginia.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
assume
you've
picked
the
best
example
for
you.
d.c.
is
a
small
place.
you
go
to
a
big
state,
and
the
lab
is
not
always
right
next
door.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
has
to
be,
of
course,
you
would
insist
that
the
person
be
called.
it
would
be
malpractice
for
you
not
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
entirely
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
the
dissent.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mccullough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
friedman,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
--
just
the
first
one,
the
no-notice
problem,
that's
kind
of
silly,
isn't
it?
because
if
you
are
being
prosecuted
for
50
grams
of
crack
cocaine,
you
can
expect
the
government
is
going
to
try
to
prove
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
