justice
antonin
scalia
bear
what
risk?
justice
antonin
scalia
bear
what
risk?
what
risk?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
says,
"is
this
your
lab
report
and
do
you
stand
by
it?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
so
--
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
understood
the
hypothetical
to
be
--
to
be
otherwise,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
want
to
say
it
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
friedman,
aren't
there
states
that
have
been
proceeding
this
way
even
before
we
came
down
with
our
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
which
states
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
are
not
under
water,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
that
adjective?
i
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
orthogonal?
justice
antonin
scalia
ooh.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we
should
use
that
in
the
opinion.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
trial
witnesses.
anything
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
just
one
or
two.
just
one
or
two
affidavits.
or
it
--
the
court
has
a
rule
you
have
to
provide
those
affidavits
several
weeks
before
trial.
that
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
we'd
have
a
whole
european-type
trial,
right?
it
would
be
trial
by
affidavit.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
more
than
that.
it
is
the
prosecution
that
has
had
to
place
the
witness
on
the
stand.
it
has
not
been
up
to
the
defense
to
say,
oh,
no,
i
object
to
this
affidavit,
i
would
like
you
to
bring
--
no.
the
prosecution
has
to
bring
in
the
witness.
that
has
been
what
the
confrontation
clause
has
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
don't
agree
with
that.
you
say
you
don't
have
to
do
it
unless
the
defendant
objects
and
issue
--
gets
a
subpoena
issued.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
that
clear
from
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
that
clear
from
the
statute?
it
just
says
that
a
subpoena
shall
issue.
what
if
a
subpoena
issues
and
nobody
comes?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
strict
construction
of
statutes
in
general,
or
a
strict
construction
of
this
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
specific
issue
of
the
person
subpoenaed
not
appearing.
do
you
have
a
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
don't
really
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
--
how
strict
construction
gets
you
to
the
--
to
the
result
that
when
it
is
the
defendant
who
has
to
take
the
initiative
to
get
the
person
brought
in,
if
the
person
doesn't
show
up,
it's
--
it
doesn't
fall
on
the
defendant;
it
falls
on
the
prosecution.
i
don't
see
how
strict
construction
gets
you
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
problem
you
describe,
the
hearsay
rule
would
have
solved
that
alone,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
what's
left
for
the
confrontation
clause
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
still
not
clear
--
not
clear
under
the
statute
that
if
the
witness
doesn't
show
up,
it's
the
prosecution
that
bears
the
burden.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
what
the
consequence
of
his
not
appearing
is.
that
the
--
that
the
written
testimony
is
--
stands
and
is
admitted,
without
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
prosecutor
issues
the
subpoena.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
witness
does
not
show
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
fault
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
i'm
talking
about
the
fact
that
the
witness
has
died,
has
fled
the
state,
is
simply
not
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
he
is
required
to
appear.
but
what
happens
if
he
doesn't
appear?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
we're
not
going
in
circles
at
all.
you
--
you
appeal
to
the
language
that
the
witness
shall
appear
as
resolving
what
happens
when
he
doesn't,
and
it
doesn't
resolve
that.
it
just
says
he
must
appear.
and
if
he
doesn't
appear,
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
the
statute
requiring
that.
it
requires
that
of
the
witness,
he
shall
appear.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
new
is
the
new
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
the
--
the
reply
brief
of
--
of
the
petitioners
mentions
that
--
that
the
same
thing,
a
spike
occurred
in
other
jurisdictions
after
melendez-diaz,
but
then
the
spike
went
down,
after
--
after
6
months
or
a
short
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
peculiar
about
virginia
that
--
or
what
is
peculiar
about
michigan
or
the
other
states
that
have
this
system
and
somehow
are
able
to
live
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
virginia
criminals
are
nastier;
is
that
it?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
we
said
in
melendez-diaz,
unfortunately.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
said
the
following:
"more
fundamentally,
the
confrontation
clause
imposes
a
burden
on
the
prosecution
to
present
its
witnesses,
not
on
the
defendant
to
bring
those
adverse
witnesses
into
court.
"
"its
value
to
the
defendant
is
not
replaced
by
a
system
in
which
the
prosecution
presents
its
evidence
via
ex
parte
affidavits
and
waits
for
the
defendant
to
subpoena
the
affiants,
if
he
chooses.
"
so
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
that
--
that
statement?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
present
only
if
the
defendant
asks
for
him,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
exactly
what
this
addressed.
it's
not
--
it's
not
replaced
by
a
system
in
which
the
prosecution
presents
its
evidence
by
--
and
waits
for
the
defendant
to
subpoena
the
affiants
if
he
chooses.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be.
it's
a
perfectly
reasonable
argument.
i
just
object
to
your
saying
that
it
doesn't
contradict
melendez-diaz.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
just
doesn't
--
doesn't
apply
just
to
analysts,
right?
i
mean,
is
there
anything
peculiar
about
analysts?
would
it
not
exist
for
any
other
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
--
is
that
a
yes
or
a
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
as
far
as
the
confrontation
clause
is
concerned,
this
would
apply
to
other
witnesses
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
indicia
of
reliability
--
you
want
us
to
go
back
to
that?
is
that--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
many
hundreds
of
cases
will
it
take
to
identify
those
limits
under
that
very
clear
due
process
clause?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
we
want
clear
rules
for
the
presentation?
don't
we
want
clear
rules,
not
gambling
on
what
the
supreme
court
will
say
about
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
do
we
have
to
say
anything
in
this
case?
why
is
this
case
here
except
as
an
opportunity
to
upset
melendez-diaz?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
virginia
statute
no
longer
exists,
does
it?
so
we
are
pronouncing
on
the
validity
of
a
virginia
statute
that
is
now
gone,
right?
they
have
adopted
a
statute
that
complies
completely
with
melendez-diaz.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
criticizing
virginia;
i'm
criticizing
us
for
taking
the
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that
question
of
prior
state
law,
right?
