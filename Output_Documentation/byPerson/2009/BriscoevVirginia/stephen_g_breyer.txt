justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
theory
of
this?
i
understand
in
hearsay,
which
as
we
have
just
seen
demonstrated,
is
very
complicated,
filled
with
all
kinds
of
rules--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--some
of
which
i
may
recall
and
others
of
which
i
certainly
don't.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
--
the
confrontation
clause,
i
would
have
thought,
would
have
picked
out
the
heart
of
that.
so
we
have
sir
walter
raleigh
and
sir
walter
raleigh
says,
"bring
in
witnesses",
which
they
wouldn't.
so
why
shouldn't
we
say
what
this
clause
is
about
is
sir
walter
raleigh?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
bring
in
the
witnesses.
now,
once
you
bring
them
in,
the
defendant
can
do
what
he
wants.
he
has
had
his
chance
to
cross-examine
them.
end
of
the
matter,
and
leave
the
rest
up
to
the
hearsay
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
have
--
you
could
have
hearsay
that
is
not
prepared
for
testimony.
there
are
all
kinds
of
categories.
and
suppose,
in
your
case,
this
hearsay
of
business
record
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
how
often
will
you
say:
i
understand
it's
admissible,
but
i
would
like
as
well
to
call
the
witness
who
prepared
it.
will
you
do
that
very
often?
suppose
you
learn
that
that
witness
is
--
is
4,000
miles
away,
so
you
say,
i'd
like
to
call
this
witness,
and
you
know
perfectly
well
that
it's
going
to
be
virtually
impossible
for
that
witness
to
be
produced.
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
think
of
something
that's
hearsay,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
will
defense
attorneys,
if
they
have
the
right
under
the
constitution
to
insist
that
a
lab
technician
be
present,
in
cases
where
they
happen
to
know
that
lab
technician
has
left
the
job
and
is
married
and
is
reliving
in
a
distant
state,
say
okay,
let's
call
her.
and
that
way
the
prosecution
really
cannot
present
the
case
except
at
inordinate
expense.
and
i'm
concerned
about
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
don't
see
quite
how
to
deal
with
it,
how
much
of
a
problem
it
is,
and
the
impact
on
this
particular
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
except
anecdotally,
but
massachusetts
seems
to
be
having
huge
problems,
reported
anecdotally,
with
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--rouse
--
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
woman,
barbara
--
barbara
rouse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
there
are
conflicting
reports
in
the
newspapers,
but
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
if
the
lab
is
--
is
divided
into
four
or
five
parts
and
there
is
several
different
machines
and
we
have
different
people
at
different
times
using
these
different
machines
and
performing
different
operations
and
each,
at
the
end,
certifies
that
the
red
light
was
on
or
it
was
this
or
it
was
that?
now,
do
we
have
to
call
all
those
people?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
each
of
them--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--each
of
them
looked
at
a
special
part.
each
of
them
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
it
was
this
or
that,
and
in
respect
to
each
of
those
statements,
it's
this
or
that.
that
is
hearsay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
no
confrontation
because
in
this
instance
the
hearsay
prevents
the
confrontation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
if
a
laboratory
is
so
organized
so
that
six
or
seven
people
perform
different
steps
of
the
operation,
if
it
is
organized
in
that
way,
all
of
them
must
be
brought?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
believe
so,
but
you
gave
me
an
answer
saying
they
did
have
to,
so
--
because
you
said
they
could
organize
differently.
so
now
explain
to
me
why
they
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason
that
i
ask
is
because
floating
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is
--
is
if
--
(a)
does
the
confrontation
clause
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
the
answer
to
(a)
is
yes,
then
are
there
different
kinds
of
implementation
rules
in
different
areas
where
there
are
other
signs
of
security,
where
there
are
other
reasons
for
thinking
it's
not
bad
testimony?
that
line
is
not
something
that's
necessarily
workable,
and
--
but
i
brought
it
up
to
try
to
think
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
think
that
underlying
this
is
a
fairly
simple
problem,
conceptually.
imagine
we
have
sir
walter
raleigh
at
trial,
and
there's
an
affidavit
for
missing
witness
a
and
witness
b
and
witness
c,
and
they
are
over
in
a
room
somewhere,
whether
they
were
treated
badly
or
not,
and
they
have
written
these
pieces
of
paper.
in
they
come.
and
walter
raleigh
says:
"bring
me
the
witness".
now,
suppose
they
had
trotted
him
out,
and
he
cross-examined
him.
still,
those
pieces
of
paper
came
in,
and
they
weren't
cross-examined.
and
so
what
do
we
do
about
that?
they
weren't
cross-examined,
and
how
did
they
get
in
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
read
this
statute,
it
does
let
in
that
piece
of
paper.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
why
then,
by
analogy,
isn't
the
statute
bad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
--
unless
you
--
unless
you
have
some
special
kind
--
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
some
special
--
specially
reliable
evidence
that
sort
of
fell
within
the
confrontation
clause
but
not
totally.
and
that's
what
i
--
the
more
i
think
about
that,
the
harder
that
one
is
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
to
put
my
chips
on
the
table,
which
you
probably
understand,
i
thought
the
reliability
of
this
evidence
in
the
mine
run
of
cases
was
such,
and
the
distance
from
sir
walter
raleigh
was
sufficiently
great,
that
it
fell
outside
the
scope
of
the
confrontation
clause
for
those
two
reasons,
but
mine
was
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
therefore,
what
do
i
do?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
the
statement,
the
sentence
in
this
opinion,
that,
in
your
opinion,
would
have
the
effect
of
limiting
melendez-diaz
without
overruling
it,
what
is
that
statement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
it
doesn't
quite
work,
that
the
confrontation
clause
seems
to
be
expanding,
just
with
the
opportunity
for
cross-examination
creating
all
kinds
of
incursions
into
areas
where
it's
not
necessary
for
fairness
purposes?
then
does
it
make
sense
to
say
--
hey,
unfortunately,
to
say
that
the
only
workable
system
is
that
you
have
a
system
which
has
exactly
the
confrontation
point,
but
indicia
of
reliability
do
have
an
impact
as
to
what
the
implications
of
the
confrontation
clause
violation
are,
in
terms
of
practical
trial
necessity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
there
we
are,
accepting
the
warnings
of
the
dissenters
in
crawford.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
raleigh's
witnesses
--
you
know,
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
for
the
heart
of
the
matter,
the
heart
of
the
matter,
and
they
stick
it
in
their
affidavits,
and
you
say,
oh,
don't
worry,
don't
worry,
you
can
cross-examine
them
later
in
the
trial.
