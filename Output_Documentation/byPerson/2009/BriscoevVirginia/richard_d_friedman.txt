mr.
richard
d.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
ask
the
court
in
this
case
to
take
no
new
ground
beyond
that
established
just
last
term
in
the
melendez-diaz
case,
but
the
stakes
of
this
case
are
high.
if
the
court
were
to
reverse
melendez-diaz
and
hold
that
a
state
may
impose
on
the
defendant
the
burden
of
calling
a
prosecution
witness
to
the
stand,
it
would
severely
impair
the
confrontation
right
and
threaten
a
fundamental
transformation
in
the
way
anglo-american
trials
have
been
conducted
for
hundreds
of
years.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
your
honor,
the
--
the
state
courts,
since
the
time
of
this
case
--
since
the
time
that
these
cases
were
tried,
raised
the
possibility
of
asking
the
--
that
the
defendant
could
ask
the
witness
to
bring
--
that
the
defendant
could
ask
the
prosecution
to
bring
in
the
witness.
it
doesn't
really
change
anything
from
a
straight
subpoena
statute
in
any
--
in
either
event.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
okay.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
that--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--okay,
fine,
fine.
the
--
the
two
aspects
that
melendez-diaz
said
were
wrong
with
the
subpoena
statute
are
both
present
in
this
statute
even
as
interpreted
by
the
--
by
the
state
supreme
court.
that
is,
nothing
in
melendez-diaz
--
i'm
sorry,
nothing
in
the
magruder
case
--
the
opinion
here
suggests
that
the
prosecution
would
bear
the
burden
of
calling
the
witness
to
the
stand.
i
think
the
magruder
case,
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
is
very
explicit
and
goes
in
accordance--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--that's--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
yes.
sure.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
the
cases
involve
that
were
california
v.
green
and
united
states
v.
owens.
in
both
cases,
there
were
questions
asked
of
the
witness
about
what
happened.
so
i
do
believe
--
though
it
hasn't
been
resolved
in
this
court,
i
do
believe
that
the
prosecution
should
go
beyond
simply
saying
"is
this
your"--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--no.
i
mean,
i
think
the
constitution
--
i
think
constitutionally,
the
--
the
prosecution
would
be
compelled
at
least
to
ask:
what
is
your
recollection?
do
you
endorse
this
statement?
but
even
if
that's
not
true--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
your
honor,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
it's
hardly
ever
been
tried,
for
the
obvious
reason
that
if
all
the
prosecution
does
is
say,
"is
this
it",
and
not
ask
a
further
question
of
the
witness--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
it
--
well,
that's--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--yes.
right.
but
i
--
but
it's
something
that
prosecutors
don't
try
because
they
would
have
to
bear
the
--
the
risk.
so
part
of
my
response
is:
well,
let
them
go
ahead
and
try
it
if
they
want
to.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
bear
--
bear
the
risk
that
the
--
that
the
witness
has
gotten
on
the
stand
and
is
not
even
asked
to
recall.
bear
the
cost
of
putting
a
witness
on
with
no
recollection.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
"and
do
you
stand
by
it?
"
--that's
the
critical
point.
that's
going
beyond
the
hypothetical,
as
i
understood
it
from
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
but
--
but--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--but
--
no,
no.
if
it's
"and
do
you
stand
by
it--
"
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--then
that's
fine.
but
i
do
know
of
a
couple
of
cases
involving
child
witnesses
where
they
don't
ask
--
they
put
the
witness
on
the
stand,
and
they
don't
ask
anything
about
the
events
at
issue.
and
in
those
cases
there's
--
courts
have
held
that
that's
--
that's
not
acceptable.
so--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--well,
no.
no,
then
they
presented
a
former
statement
by
the
child.
so
--
so
i
do
think
that
there
is
some
justification--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--yes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
those
are
found
to
be
violations
of
the
confrontation
clause.
the--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--confrontation
clause.
state
v.
rohrich,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
on
another
point,
and
warren,
an
illinois
appellate
case
from,
i
think,
just
last
term.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
and
there's
--
there's
the
question,
"is
this
your
report?
"
"do
you
stand
by
it?
"
then
--
then
i
don't
think
there
is
a
confrontation
clause
problem,
because
--
because
the
prosecution
has
put
the
witness
on
the
stand,
has
asked
those
questions,
and
then
the
witness
--
and--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
difference
is
that
once
you
ask
the
question
--
"do
you
stand
by
it"?
--then
the
witness
has
testified
one
way
or
another.
and
the
prosecution,
as
i
say,
bears
the
risk
that
the
witness
will
not
testify
in
accordance
with
the
prior
statement.
california--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--that's
right.
i
take
california
v.
green
at
its
word.
california
v.
green
says
and
owen
follows
up
and
says
that
if
the
witness
does
not
testify
in
accordance
with
the
prior
statement,
then
the
defendant
has
had
some
of
the
--
has
had
considerable
benefit
of
cross-examination
already.
so
--
so
the
prosecution
has
to
--
has
to
put
the
witness
through
that
pace
to
make
sure
that
that
happens.
beyond
that--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--yes.
california
v.
green
says
that
if
the
witness
testifies
inconsistently
with
the
prior
statement,
that
the
defendant
has
had
the
benefit
of
cross-examination
in
showing
the
inconsistency.
so
--
so
justice
alito
asked
me
what's
the
difference,
and
i'm
saying
a
difference,
one
difference
is,
that
if
the
witness
does
not
testify
in
accordance
with
the
prior
statement,
that's
apparent
to
--
that's
apparent
to
the
jury.
there
are
also
all
the
practical
differences
that
we
emphasize.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i'm
saying
that
the
--
that
the
witness
has
to
take
the
stand,
has
to
--
has
to
testify
live,
viva
voce,
face
to
face,
in
the
time-honored
phrases
which
have
always
governed
testimony
in
an
anglo-american
trial.
then
the
--
i
think
the
witness
has
to
at
least
be
asked
what
happened.
if
the
witness
says,
i
don't
recall,
then
the
prior
statement
may
be
introduced.
i'm
not--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
go
beyond
anything
that
has
previously
been
said.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well,
if--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
about
a
lot
more
--
there
were
nearly
200
years
of
history
between
walter
raleigh
and
the
confrontation
clause,
and
what
was
established
is
that
in
an
anglo-american
trial
witnesses
give
their
testimony
live,
face
to
face,
and
melendez-diaz
emphasized
last
term
you
can't
prove
the
case
via
an
affidavit.
so
--
so
it's
--
it's
the
fundamental
question
that
--
that
crawford
establishes
--
fundamental
principle
that
crawford
establishes
is
this
is
the
way
witnesses
testify
in
our
trials:
live,
in
front
of
the
jury,
subject
to
oath
and
then
cross-exam.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
if
--
if
the
prosecutor
is
certain
that
the
defendant
is
going
to
put
the
witness
on
the
stand,
then
--
then
the
prosecutor
has
some
reason
to
--
to
put
the
witness
on
first.
the
problem
is
that
the
--
the
defunct
virginia
statute
puts
the
burden
on
the
defendant
of
bringing
the
witness
in,
and
the
defense--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
i'm
sorry
--
but--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
but--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
the
--
the
fact
is
that
under
the
virginia
statute,
given
--
and
as
interpreted
by
the
commonwealth,
too
--
given
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
putting
the
witness
on
the
stand,
defendants
rarely
exercise
that
right,
because
it's
a
corrupted
right,
because
it
isn't
nearly
as
valuable,
as
i
think
your
honor
understands,
as
the
right
to
stand
up
and
cross-examine
a
witness
who
has
actually
just
testified.
i
don't
think
that
the
right
given
by
the
virginia
statute
is
--
the
former
virginia
statute
is
actually
the
right
to
cross-examine.
it's
not
in
form
cross-examination,
and
it's
not
in
substance
cross-examination.
it's
a
right
to
make
the
witness
the
defendant's
own,
and
that's
the
way
--
that's
the
way
the
statute
is
--
is
worded.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
that
--
that
is
a
--
certainly
a
possibility,
at
least
on
consent
of
the
defendant,
and
some
states,
including
my
own
state
of
michigan,
has
been
experimenting
with
that.
and
i
think
that's
a
plausible
possibility.
now,
if
the
defendant
were
to
insist
on
--
on
live
testimony,
that
is
an
open
--
that's
an
open
question
as
to
whether
video
testimony
would
be
acceptable.
this
court
some
years
ago
refused
to
transmit
to
congress
a
proposed
amendment
to
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
and
the
majority
in
a
statement
by
justice
scalia
said
there
is
a
virtual
satisfaction
of
the
confrontation
right,
not
a
real
satisfaction.
so
the
matter
as
to
whether
it
could
be
done
without
consent
hasn't
been
satisfied
--
hasn't
been
determined.
but
certainly
on
consent
it
could,
and
in
many
cases
i
believe
the
defendants
--
that
those
defendants
who
do
want
confrontation
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
accept
video.
but
i
do
--
i
do
want
to
respond
also
to
the
--
the
premise.
i
--
i
believe
that
sufficient
data
is
now
available
to
show
rather
clearly
that
the
expense
is
not
inordinate.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
yes,
i--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--so,
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
the
--
the
states'
amicus
brief
shows
is
that
there
are
--
there
are
a
lot
of
drug
prosecutions,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
drug
analyses,
and
then
there
is
this
speculation
about
the
type
of
gamesmanship
that
you
have
mentioned.
but
if
we
look
for
hard
data,
there
is
nothing
supporting
that.
so
let's
look
at
a
couple
of
jurisdictions
that
have
perfectly
valid
notice-and-demand
rules.
ohio
--
it's
less
than
one
appearance
per
lab
analyst
per
month.
that
is
in
the
state
lab.
less
than
one
appearance
per
month.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i'm
sure
not
for
amusement.
i
think
there's
a
certain
amount
of
solidarity.
i'm
sure
that
they
would
rather
not
have
whatever
expense
there
is.
but,
frankly,
i
think
a
large
part
is
that
they
recognize
that
the
defunct
virginia
statute
is
an
impairment
to
the
confrontation
right
and
makes
it
harder
for
defendants.
it
makes
--
it
makes
it
less
likely
that
the
confrontation
right
is
going
to
--
is
going
to
be
invoked.
let's
look
at
the
district
of
columbia.
the
district
of
columbia,
it's
about
--
it's
about
a
half
a
person
a
year
in
extra
expense
caused
by
lab
techs
having
to
come
and
testify.
that's
--
that
is
not
a
large
burden
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
in
fact,
the
district
of
columbia
--
the
lab
that
services
the
district
of
columbia
has
gotten
by
with
five
fewer
technicians
than
it
did
before
the
change.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
your
honor,
i
--
i'm
just
little
old
me,
and
i
just
picked
what
i
could
get.
and,
frankly,
the
example
i
picked
was
because
the
solicitor
general's
brief
had
data
on
the
district
of
columbia,
so
i
asked
some
more
questions.
that's
why
i
got
--
that's
why
i
got
the
district
of
columbia.
ohio
--
i
asked
because
they
are
a
neighboring
state,
and
i
was
able
to
get
some
information.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
we
are
talking
about
non-testimonial
hearsay?
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
but--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--yes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
significant
problem,
and
i
do
want
to
say
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
select
data.
i
just
got
--
presented
the
data
on
the
states
that
i
had,
and
my
own
state
of
michigan--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--absolutely,
absolutely,
including
my
own
state.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
they
--
well,
they
include
my
own
state
of
michigan;
they
include
the
state
of
new
york--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--the
problems
of
the
state
of
michigan
are
not
attributable
to
the
use
of
this
procedure,
no.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
it
--
it
is
--
yes,
but
it's
not
a
significant
problem,
and
one
reason
it's
not
a
significant
problem
is
that
the
possibility
of
a
deposition
is
always--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--not
--
not
according
to
--
not
according
to
the
chief
of
the
--
chief
trial
counsel,
suffolk
--
the
suffolk
district
attorney's
office--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--excuse
me.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
in
my
reply
brief
on
page
27,
i
quote
patrick
hagan,
who
says
--
who
says:
"the
sky
has
not
fallen;
we
can
do
this
very
well.
"
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
it's
--
and,
of
course,
there
can
be
an
adjustment
period,
but
--
but
states
can
adjust.
i
think
the
--
the
simplest
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
is
the
use
of
depositions,
and
i
think
prosecutors
probably
have
been
underusing
depositions.
but
--
but
if
a
lab
tech
is
about
to
retire
and
that
lab
tech
has
done
a
test
that
is
about
to
be
used,
then
take
the
deposition.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
no,
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
call
all
those
people.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
do
believe
that
there
has
to
be--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
the
problem,
of
course,
isn't
hearsay.
the
problem
is
--
the
only
question
is--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
the
--
the
prosecution
has
to
present
the
testimony
of
witnesses.
it
has
to
present
the
testimony
live.
depending
on
how
the
lab
is
organized
--
usually,
labs
can
organize
so
that
only
one
person
needs
to
--
needs
to
present.
in
any
event,
of
course,
the
state
is
acknowledging
that,
if
the
defendant
brings
--
demands
they
have
to
bring
in
the
witnesses,
that's
not
at
issue.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--but
even
if
--
even
if
they
are
organized
in
that
way,
for
instance,
if
one
person
observes
all
the
--
all
the
procedures,
that's
sufficient.
apart
from
that,
as
melendez-diaz
indicates,
it's
up
to
the
--
it's
up
to
the
state
to
decide
what
the
evidence
they
are
going
to
present
is,
whether--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--yes.
right.
well,
i
think
melendez-diaz
indicates
that
it's
up
to
the
state
to
determine
what
the
--
the
evidence
that's
going
to
be
presented,
and
there
may
be
gaps.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
this
is
an
issue
that--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i
think
--
i
think
that
there
probably
has
to
be
a
witness
who
has
observed
the
procedures.
if
i
am
--
and
that's
an
issue
that
will
be
presented
to
the
court,
we
can
be
pretty
certain.
i
think
that
issue
is
entirely
orthogonal
to
the
issue
here
because
the
commonwealth
is
acknowledging--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--orthogonal.
right
angle.
unrelated.
irrelevant.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
orthogonal.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right,
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
should
have
--
i
probably
should
have
said--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i
thought
--
i
thought
i
had
seen
it
before.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
that's
a
bit
of
--
a
bit
of
professorship
creeping
in,
i
suppose.
but
the
commonwealth
is
acknowledging
that
they
have
to
bring
in
witnesses
if
the
--
if
the
defense
demands,
so
this
is
another
issue
as
to
who
are
--
who
are
the
witnesses.
and
it's--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--in
my
view,
it
wouldn't,
but
if
i'm
wrong,
it
doesn't
change
this
case
whatsoever.
it
does
not
change
this
case
whatsoever.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
here.
the
issue
here
is
--
is
the
witnesses
who
are
going
to
testify
and
how
much
they
--
they
testify,
and
i
want
to--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
yes.
i
think
--
i
think
it's
an
interesting
question,
and
it's
question
3
in
the
evidence
exam
that
i
am
just
grading,
in
fact.
but
i
think
that's
an
issue
that
the
court
will
have
to
resolve.
and,
as
i
say,
my
views
are
what
they
--
what
they
are,
but
if
you
reject
my
views
on
that,
it
doesn't
change
this
case
whatsoever.
what
i
think
is
important
to
recognize
is
how
fundamental
a
transformation
in
the
anglo-american
trial
is
threatened
if
--
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
the
prosecution
can
present
an
affidavit
and
leave
it
to
the
defendant,
if
he
dares,
to
put
the
witness
on
the
stand.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
right.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
wouldn't
call
that
cross-exam--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--it's
fundamental
transformation
because
the
prosecution
can
present
a
stack
of
affidavits,
and
they
wouldn't
even
have
to
be
affidavits.
they
could
just
be
signed
--
they
could
just
be
statements.
it
could
present
videotapes.
it
could
present
audiotapes.
it
could
craft
those
and
rehearse
those
behind
the
scene.
it
could
present
those
to
the
trial--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i
think
there's
an
enormous
difference
in
--
in
impact.
it's
an
enormous
impact,
as
i've
emphasized
in
my
brief,
because
of
the
impairment
of
the
ability
to
examine.
i
don't
believe
it's
cross-examination.
in
practice,
it
is
--
if
the
defendant
said,
i
don't
want
to
cross-examine,
but
i
still
insist
that
the
witness
get
up
on
the
stand
and
let's
see
what
the
witness
can
do
--
and
the
commonwealth
makes
no
attempt
to
distinguish
between
these
witnesses
and
other
witnesses
for
what
is
--
what
is
satisfactory
confrontation.
it
says:
this
is
good
confrontation.
he
could
do
it
with
all
witnesses.
if
the
court
pleases,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
not
a
notice-and-demand
statute.
it
does
not
even
provide
notice
to
the
defendant
unless
he
asks
for
it
ahead
of
time.
it
doesn't
give
any
deadline
as
to
when
he
should
make
a
demand
or
take
any
other
action.
it
just
says
that
--
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
language
of
the
statute
--
it
says
that
the
defendant
may
cause
the
witness
to
be
summoned.
there's
no
--
there's
no
deadline.
it
doesn't
put
the
burden
of
no-shows
on
the
prosecution.
it's
the
defendant's
witness,
and
it
clearly
doesn't
call
--
it
doesn't
provide
that
the
prosecution
should
call
the
--
the
witness.
virginia--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--that's
likely,
of
course.
but
the
fact
is
virginia
knows
how
to
write
a
good
notice-and-demand
statute
and
has
done
it,
and
contrast
the
--
the
new
statute,
which
gives
28
days
notice.
it's
--
it's
very
glaring.
if
virginia
wanted
to
write
a
notice-and-demand
statute
before,
it
could
have.
now,
i
think
i
can
explain
what's
different
about
virginia.
and
what
happened
is
after
the
--
after
the
defendants'
--
after
the
defendants'
trials
--
let
me
say,
after
the
defendants'
trials,
the
--
the
prosecution
is
saying,
you
could
have
subpoenaed.
and
they
said
this
isn't
testimony.
okay?
they
were
wrong
on
both
of
those
counts.
after
the
defendants'
trials,
in
a
case
called
brooks,
the
--
the
virginia
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
the
defendant
could
ask
the
prosecution
to
bring
the
witness
in.
many
defendants
did
that,
including
grant,
the
defendant
on
whom
--
in
the
case
on
whom
the
commonwealth
relies
so
heavily.
the
prosecution
ignored
those
requests.
it
was
still
taking
the
view
that
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
testimonial.
up
until
the
moment
that
this
court
decided
melendez-diaz,
the
commonwealth
in
virginia
in
--
in
grant
said,
we
don't
have
to
bring
the
witness
in;
the
witness
--
the
defendant
should
subpoena
the
witness
if
he
wants.
no
court
has
ever
held
--
no
court
has
ever
held
in
virginia
that
the
prosecution
bears
the
risk
of
--
of
no-shows.
now,
the
commonwealth
and
the
united
states
suggest:
oh,
it's
okay
to
--
to
transform
the
way
trials
are
conducted
by
allowing
the
prosecution
to
present
affidavits
because
you
can
backfill
with
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
that
goes
against
decisions
of
this
court
that
say
when
there's
a
specific
right
addressed
to
a
particular
situation,
we
rely
on
that,
not
on
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
that
would
--
that
would
not
be
enough,
no.
it's
enough
--
it's
enough--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--well,
that's
--
that's
one
problem.
the
no-show.
but--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--but
there
are
two
--
they
are
both
problems.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
no,
no,
no,
your--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--no,
your
honor,
because
it's
sufficient
that
the
statute
is
very
clear
and
the
commonwealth
doesn't
deny
that
it's
the
defendant's
burden
under
the
statute
to
call
the
witness
to
the
stand.
so
whatever
the
no-show
issue,
however
that
might
stand
under
state
law,
what
melendez-diaz
called
the
more
fundamental
problem,
which
is
that
the
statute
imposes
on
the
defense
the
burden
of
calling
a
witness
to
the
stand,
is
clearly
provided
for
in
this
statute.
so
there's
no
reason--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
--i
don't
think
this
is
a
question
of
order
of
proof.
this
is
a
question
of
who
puts
the
witness
on
the
stand.
melendez
addressed
that
very
explicitly
in
part
iii-e
and
said
that
an
affidavit
doesn't
do,
that
the
prosecution
has
to
present
prosecution
witnesses.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
may
--
may
i
respond
to
that?
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
thank
you.
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
--
the
proper
response
here
is
the
court
has
taken
the
case;
there
is
enough
without
any
--
resolving
any
ambiguities
of
the
virginia
statute
to
say
that
the
--
this
procedure
is
unconstitutional,
because
it
imposes
--
even
without
worrying
about
the
no-show
point,
it
imposes
upon
the
defendant
the
burden
of
putting
the
witness
on
the
stand.
given
that
all
these
states
and
the
united
states
are
contesting
that
this
procedure
is
acceptable,
i
think
it's
proper
for
the
court
to
say
right
now
that
it
--
that
it
is
not.
