mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
an
appropriate
place
to
start
would
be
how
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
construed
the
statute
and
get
past
that
and
into
the
confrontation
issue.
the
first
thing
i
would
note
there
is
that
the
petitioners
simply
have
not
challenged
the
decision
of
the
--
the
interpretation
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
that
it
placed
on
the
statute.
so
i
think,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
now,
for
the
first
time
in
their
reply
brief,
trying
to
raise
a
separate
due
process
issue,
that
the
construction
of
the
court
was
so
unreasonable
that
it
violates
due
process,
it's
far
too
late
in
the
day
to
do
that.
so
i
think
the
court--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--right.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
i
think
the
--
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
construed
the
statute
is
perfectly
sensible.
what
it
says
--
and
the
key
phrase
is
on
page
2
of
our
brief
--
that
"no"
--
excuse
me
--
"such
witnesses
shall
be
summoned
and
appear
at
the
cost
of
the
commonwealth.
"
and
unlike
some
statutes
that
say
the
defendant
shall
subpoena
or
shall
summon
--
for
example,
like
the
idaho
and
the
north
dakota
statutes
that
the
petitioners
cite
--
they
are
express
in
saying
it
has
to
be
the
defendant
who
issues
a
summons.
this
just
says
"shall
be
summoned".
in
a
criminal
trial
at
the
time
these
petitioners
were
being
tried,
there
were
two
parties
that
have
the
authority
to
issue
summons.
one
was
the
clerk
of
court;
that
is,
a
defendant
would
go
to
the
court
and
say:
these
are
my
witnesses;
have
them
produced
for
trial
on
this
date.
and
the
other
was
the
commonwealth.
so
the
statute
simply
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be
the
commonwealth,
it
has
to
be
the
defendant.
it's
silent.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
a
long
history
of
construing
statutes
in
a
way
that
obviates
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
right.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
i
think
it
was
incumbent
on
counsel
to
raise
the
issue
exactly
like
counsel
for
the
defendant
did
in
the
grant
case.
and
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
in
the
grant
case
the
--
the
motion
was
filed
well
in
advance
of
trial,
on
november
2nd,
2007,
before
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
ever
construed
the
statute
in
this
fashion.
and
so
the
fact
that
a
statute
may
be
susceptible
to
more
than
one
interpretation
doesn't
obviate
the
need
for
counsel
to
take
the
steps
that
are
necessary
to
protect
the
right.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
i
think--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--i
think
there
are
several
constitutional,
legal,
and
practical
considerations
that
make
this--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--right.
constitutionally,
there
are
two
obstacles
to
a
wholesale
type
of
trial
system
where
the
prosecution
would
simply
present
a
stack
of
affidavits.
the
first
of
those
is
the
due
process
clause,
which
--
for
example,
in
these
child
witness
cases,
what
a
number
of
courts
have
held
is
that
it's
going
to
inflame
the
jury
against
the
defendant
if
a
videotape
is
introduced
and
then
the
defendant
is
called
--
forced
to
call
the
witness
to
the
stand.
and
that's
simply
not
the
case
with
these
types
of
witness.
so
the
due
process
clause
itself
puts
the
brakes
on
the
type
of
wholesale
at-trial--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--another
is
the
fact
that
under
the
confrontation
clause,
the
cross-examination
has
to
be
effective.
and
so
if
the
prosecution
on
the
day
of
trial
dumps
a
series
of
affidavits
on
the
defense,
it's
going
to
be
pretty
difficult
for
the
defense
to
be
in
a
position
to
effectively
cross-examine.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
i
think,
under
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--right.
i
don't
think
the
confrontation
clause,
in
terms
of
what
it's
historically
intended
to
protect,
blocks
that
scenario.
i
think
the
key
to
the
confrontation
clause,
what
this
court
has
said
for
a
long
time,
turning
to
the
history
of
the
clause,
is
that
it's
designed
to
protect
the
reliability
of
the
government's
evidence.
and
the
way
it
does
that
is
by
subjecting
that
to
the
crucible
of
cross-examination,
face
to
face,
of
live
witnesses.
and
this
statute
protects
exactly
that;
that
is,
the
defendant
says
he
wants
the
witness
there--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--we
agree
that
we
have
to
produce
the
witness
for
court,
but
we
see
little
constitutional--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--well,
we
agree
that
if
the
defendant
does
provide
the
notice,
as
with
the
noticeand
--
demand
statute,
that
it
--
that
it's
our
burden
to
make
sure
that
witness
is
there.
and
if
--
as
the
statute
provides,
the
witness
has
to
be
summoned
and
appear.
so
this
statute
has
always
been
strictly
construed
against
the
prosecution.
if
it
fails
to
do
exactly
what
the
statute
requires,
that
cuts
against
the
prosecution.
so
the
witness
does
have
to
appear.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
right.
and
it
--
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
--
excuse
me,
that
the
statute
is
interpreted
strictly
against
the
prosecution
comes
from
several
decades
of
jurisprudence
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
and
we
cite
those
cases
on
page
1
our
brief.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
this
particular
--
this
particular
statutory
scheme.
for
example,
if
the
--
19.2-187,
the
statute
that
precedes
this,
says
that
it
has
to
be
filed
7
days
before
the
trial.
and
if
it's
filed
6
days,
forget
it,
you
have
to
bring
in
a
live
witness.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
no,
i
don't
have
a
case--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--but
i
--
but
i
think
the
answer
follows
inexorably--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--the
--
the
grant
case,
for
example,
which
our
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
said
was
simply
was
an
application
of
the
holding
in
the
magruder
decision.
there
the
defendant
did
--
well
in
advance
of
trial,
sent
notice
to
the
commonwealth
and
said,
i
want
the
witness
there.
the
commonwealth
didn't
get
the
subpoena
out.
so
that
was
the
first
part
of
that,
"shall
be
summoned".
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
should
never
have
allowed
this
in,
without
the
live
witness
being
present.
and
so
what
--
although
grant
didn't
address
the
appear
part,
the
same
answer
is
true;
that
is,
the
defendant
says,
i
want
the
witness
there;
the
commonwealth
issues
a
summons,
but
the
witness
doesn't
appear.
it's
the
same
result.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
i
think
your
question
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
why
we
have
the
confrontation
clause.
it
wasn't
because
of
this
formalistic
order
of
proof
that
our
modern
trials
have.
and
--
and
one
thing
that
makes
this
case
conceptually
difficult
is
we
are
so
accustomed
to
this
clean
order
of
presentation
--
that
--
that
that's
how
we
have
all
tried
our
cases,
that's
how
we
are
used
to
seeing
them,
but
that's
not
the
heart
of
the
confrontation
clause.
the
confrontation
clause
is
because,
for
example,
the
colonists
were
subject
to
anonymous--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--it
does.
but--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--well,
because--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--i
think
there
are--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--there
are
characteristics,
of
course,
to
this
particular
type
of
evidence
that
were
debated
in
this
court's
melendez-diaz
opinion
that
make
this
procedure
certainly
more
appropriate,
and
one
of
those
is,
these
--
what
--
functionally
what
you
are
doing
when
you
have
this
witness
on
the
stand
is
either
past
recollection
recorded
or
past
recollection
refreshed,
because
they
are
doing
approximately
900
of
these
certificates
a
year.
they
are
largely
fungible
things
like
--
like
crack
cocaine
or
powder
cocaine.
and
so
we're
miles
from
the
type
of
scenario
where--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--right.
i--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--well,
i
think,
though,
even
--
even
going
back
to
the
very
heart
--
the
historical
heart
of
this
clause,
the
problems
for
these
colonists
was
anonymous
accusers
and
absentee
witnesses.
that's
--
that's
why
--
they
were
enraged
because
of
this
deeply
unfair
trial
procedure.
it
wasn't
because,
for
example,
a
harbor
master
might
be
called
in
and
records
of
what
ships
came
in
for
these
colonists
who
were
in
the
vice
admiralty
courts,
and
some
paper
is
introduced
about
what
ships
came
in,
and
then
they
get
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
them
before
the
prosecution
has
asked
any
questions
of
the
--
the
harbor
master.
that's
not
the
problem,
that
the
confrontation
--
confrontation
clause--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--well,
that's
one
of
the
practical--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--well,
the
confrontation
clause
is
designed
to
ensure
--
the
core
of
it
--
and
we
agree
with
this
--
is
what
this
court
has
said
for
a
long
time,
a
face-to-face
encounter
with
a
witness
who
is
cross-examined
face
to
face,
under
oath.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
right.
but
first
--
a
couple
points
in
response.
first
of
all,
the
statute
doesn't
say
at
what
point
the
defendant
gets
to
treat
this
witness
as
an
adverse
witness.
it
just
says
the
report
comes
in,
and
then
the
defendant
can
call
the
witness
as
an
adverse
witness.
and
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
deliberately
left
the
question
of
the
order
of
proof
unresolved,
because
it
viewed
those
things
as
a
due
process
issue.
so
i
don't
think
it's
axiomatic
under
the
statute,
although
it's
possible,
that
the
defendant
would
conduct
a
cross-examination
during
his
case.
but
--
but
beyond
that,
the
confrontation
clause
isn't
designed
to
constitutionalize
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
29
or
a
motion
to
strike.
the
defendant
could
still
--
in
virginia
procedure,
it's
a
motion
to
strike.
the
defendant
could
still
make
that
motion
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
no,
i
think
that's
very
clear.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
under
both
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
way
it's
been
construed
adversely
to
the
commonwealth.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
the
witness
shall
be
summoned
and
appear.
so
there's
a
requirement
of
appearance.
and
if
the
defendant
asks
the
prosecutor
to
summon
the
witness,
the
witness
then
has
to
appear.
and
going
--
and
we
cite
some
of
these
cases,
again
on
page
1
of
our
brief.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
the
consequence
emerges
from
this
line
of
cases,
justice
scalia,
that
if
the
--
the
statute
requires
the
witness
to
appear,
and
if
the
commonwealth
doesn't
do
exactly
what
the
statute
requires,
a
live
witness
--
or
excuse
me,
the
certificate
does
not
come
in
without
the
live
witness.
just
like,
if
you
don't
--
the
statute
says
file
7
days
before
court.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
right.
and
that
would--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--right.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
but
i
think
the
language
answers
that.
the
witness
has
to
appear.
the
statute
says
shall
be
summoned,
and
the
requirement
is
that
the
witness
appear.
if
the
witness
does
not
appear--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--i'm
sorry,
but
we
seem
to
be
going
in
--
in
circles.
and
i
want
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
if
he
doesn't
appear,
the
commonwealth
has
failed
to
do
what
the
statute
requires,
which
is
to
make
sure
the
witness
appears.
and
if
the
commonwealth
fails
to
do
exactly
what
the
statute
requires,
it
must
--
it
cannot
rely
on
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
and
--
i
mean,
to
the
extent
there's
--
there's
any
question
about
that,
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
that
this
court
should
resolve
in
the
first
instance.
i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
remand
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
determine
what
--
what
the
statute
requires
in
that
instance.
let
me
just
spend
a
moment
since
we've
talked
about
the
costs.
our
experience
in
virginia,
we
--
of
course,
we've
repealed
this
statute.
this
court
signaled
in
melendez-diaz
what
a
safe
harbor
was,
with
notice
and
demand,
and
so
we
went
there.
and
what
we
have
seen
under
our
new
statute
is
rampant
demands
for
the
witness
to
appear,
followed
by:
oh,
well,
he's
here;
i'll
stipulate.
or
no
questions
of
the
witness.
so
our
experience
under
this
old
statute
compared
to
our
new
one
is
that
we
had
far
more
--
or
far
less
under
our
old
statute
of
this
sort
of
tactical
demands
for
confrontation.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
it
went
into
effect
august
21,
2009.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
the
spike
has
plateaued
somewhat
in
virginia,
but
we
are
still
seeing
extensive
gamesmanship.
and
i
think--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--well,
i
think--
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
--no,
i
--
i
think
--
i
--
i
don't
know
that
--
that
there's
anything
particularly
different
about
virginia
criminals.
i
will
say
that
this
type
of
statute
--
as
this
court
noted
in
melendez-diaz,
defense
attorneys
don't
want
to
necessarily
antagonize
the
court
and
so
on
by
making
these
kinds
of
gamesmanship
demands.
mr.
stephen
r.
mccullough
well,
a
cross-examinationfocused
statute
like
this
one
more
blatantly
exposes
that
type
of
gamesmanship
and,
therefore,
may
have
a
better
deterrent
value,
as
opposed
to
a
garden
variety
statute.
i
do
want
to
just
say,
really
briefly,
that
the
practical
concerns,
even
if
they
are
not
constitutional
concerns,
are
very
important
because
the
prosecution
always
bears
the
burden
of
persuasion,
and
a
live
witness
is
always
more
compelling
than
a
piece
of
paper.
and
so
the
--
the
practical
realities
of
this
--
a
trial
by
affidavit
simply
are
not
likely
to
be
there.
i
see
my
time's
expired.
i
thank
the
court.
