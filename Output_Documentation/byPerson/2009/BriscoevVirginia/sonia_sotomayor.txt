justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
state
court
has
interpreted
their
provision
to
give
the
defendant
the
choice
of
subpoenaing
the
witness
or
asking
the
state
to
bring
in
the
witness.
why
is
that
overruling
melendez-diaz?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
is
that
different
from
a
notice
statute?
if--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
we
take
the
statute
as
the
state
supreme
court
has
read
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they
say:
in
my
mind,
it's
a
notice
statute;
tell
the
prosecutor
you
either
want
them
to
call
the
witness
or
you
subpoena
the
witness.
that's
what
the
state
court
has
told
us.
whether
or
not
you
had
notice
of
that
interpretation
is
a
separate
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
separate
out
the
two
questions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
our
first
question--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--does
the
confrontation
clause
require,
not
just
the
ability
to
cross-examine--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
an
affirmative
obligation
to
place
the
witness
on
the
stand?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
just
ask
you
one--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
swearing
the
witness
in
and
saying
to
the
witness
"is
this
your
report"?
and
the
witness
saying
"yes"
--
what
would
be
unconstitutional
about
that,
given
our
case
law
that
says
that
any
prior
statements
by
a
witness
are
admissible
once
the
witness
is
on
the
stand
or
constitutionally
admissible
once
they
are
on
the
stand?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
"should"
is
a
different
question
than
the
one
i
asked.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
anything
historically
or
in
any
case
that
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement?
i
mean,
i
do
accept
that
there
is
plenty
that
says
you
have
a
right
to
be--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
confront
the
witness.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
would
require
the
prosecutor
to
actually
do
more
than
i
just
suggested?
"is
this
your
statement?
"
"is
this
your
lab
report?
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
not
terribly
persuasive.
i
don't
disagree
with
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
a
matter
of
trial
tactic,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
trial
tactic.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
--
so
what
difference?
that's
because
there's
nothing
in
evidence
about
the
incident,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
was
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--those
were
found
--
i
don't
--
were
those
found
as
violations
of
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
due
process?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
on
the
past
recollection
recorded,
the
witness
doesn't
stand
by
the
statement.
the
witness
says:
i
made
the
statement,
have
no
current
knowledge;
i
can't
stand
by
it
or
not
stand
by
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
asking
us
now
to
state
something
that
you
admit
is
in
really
no
constitutional
case
or
historical
case,
that
says
the
right
to
confrontation
means
that
the
witness
has
to
tell
the
story,
and
the
form
of
telling
that
story
has
to
be
a
verbal
recitation;
it
can't
be
past
recorded
recollection
because
you
just
said
they
have
to
tell
the
story.
it
can't
be
based
on
official
documents
or
anything
else,
because
it
has
to
be
their
story.
am
i
hearing
you
wrong?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
--
and
--
i
trust
the
trial
process,
and
much
of
your
brief
was
talking
about
that
process--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
the
fact
that
it's
much
more
effective
when
the
witness
tells
their
story
and
you
get
a
chance
to
cross-examine
than
if
you
have
to
start
from
the
platform
of
cross-examination.
once
a
defendant
makes
it
known
that
a
--
he's
going
to
cross-examine
a
lab
technician,
don't
you
think
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
put
that
witness
on?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
he
does
or
doesn't,
why
shouldn't
we
leave
it
to
the
normal
trial
strategy
and
practice
to
leave
to
that
prosecutor
the
burden
of
non-persuasion,
which
is
what
confrontation
was
about?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well
--
well,
i
was
starting
from
a
different
proposition
than
you
did--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
i
think
that's
a
question
for
your
adversaries:
how
could
you
have
known--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
you
should
have
asked
the
state
to
bring
that
witness
in?
but
putting
that
aside--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assume
we
are
reading
it
the
way
the
court
has
now.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
goes
--
that
goes
to
the
waiver
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
did
they
know
at
trial
that
they
were
supposed
to
say
to
you:
i
don't
want
a
subpoena;
you
bring
them
in.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
--
you're
still
begging
the
question.
how
--
they
did
what
any
reasonable
defendant
would
do
and
say:
i
object
to
the
admission
of
this
lab
report;
i
have
a
right
under
the
confrontation
clause
to
have
the
--
the
lab
technician
here.
and
the
commonwealth
court
said,
no,
you
don't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
did
the
court
on
appeal.
how
did
they
know
that
this
was
a
noticeand
--
demand
statute
as
opposed
to
a
subpoena
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you:
if
we
were
to
--
how
do
we
articulate
a
rule,
or
do
we
need
to,
that
would
take
care
of
the
fears
of
your
adversary
that
trials
would
become
trials
by
affidavit,
that
the
--
that
prosecutors
will
choose
to
put
all
witnesses
on
--
by
videotape,
by
affidavit,
by
deposition,
whatever
mode
they
choose
except
bringing
them
into
court
--
and
forcing
defendants
then
to
call
the
witnesses
and
do
a
what's
--
what
i
call
a
cold-cross?
what
rule
would
we
announce
in
this
case--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
would
avoid
--
what
constitutional
construction
of
the
confrontation
clause
would
we
issue
that
would
protect
against
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
forget
the
practical.
talk
about
the
legal,
constitutional.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
are
you
suggesting
or
are
you
saying
even
a
trial
by
affidavit
is
okay
under
the
confrontation
clause?
is
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
absolutely
saying
that,
under
the
confrontation
clause,
trial
by
affidavit
of
any
witness
would
be
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
--
are
you
then
saying
that
there
is
some
other
constitutional
limit
to
that
choice,
outside
of
the
confrontation
clause?
and
if
you
are,
what
would
be
that
other
constitutional
limit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
do
we
say
to
them,
contrary
to
what
melendez-diaz
is,
that
subpoena
statutes
--
when
you
read
the
statute,
it
says
the
defendant
has
to
subpoena
the
witness.
on
its
--
on
the
face
of
this
statute,
without
the
commonwealth
court's
gloss
on
it--
