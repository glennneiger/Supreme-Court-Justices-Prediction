justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
--
ask
this
question?
the
question
here
is
whether
there
was
eligibility
for
fees.
could
the
district
judge
in
your
view
say,
yes,
i
think
the
plaintiff
is
eligible
for
fees,
but
it
was
actually
a
very
difficult
legal
issue,
and
the
defendant's
position
was
entirely
reasonable,
so
i
think
as
a
matter
of
discretion
i
will
not
award
any
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
aren't
you
treating
the
statute
as
though
it
did
have
a
prevailing
party
clause
in
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
not
your
construction
one
that
just
treats
the
statute
as
though
it
required
the
plaintiff
to
be
a
prevailing
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
you
rely
very
heavy
on
ruckelshaus,
which
of
course
was
a
case
in
which
the
fees
were
sought
to
be
imposed
against
the
government.
is
there
a
basis
for
distinguishing
on
a
sort
of
a
sovereign
immunity
approach
for
saying
that
maybe
there
should
be
a
stricter
standard
when
you're
taking
money
away
from
the
sovereign
than
when
you're
taking
it
away
from
private
litigants?
