chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-448,
hardt
v.
reliance
standard
life
insurance
company.
mr.
ates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
she
prevailed
in
some
way
to
give
her
another
chance
to
make
that
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
just
saying
i
think
you're
giving
up
too
much.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
you
get
in
justice
kennedy's
situation,
where
the
court
doesn't
know
what's
going
to
happen
on
remand?
you
know,
the
objection
is
--
the
administrator
throws
it
out,
saying,
you
know,
you
filed
the
wrong
form,
so
you
lose.
and
the
district
court
says
you
can't
throw
it
out
on
that
basis;
under
trust
law,
it
doesn't
matter.
and
it
goes
back.
now,
the
district
court
doesn't
know
what's
going
to
happen.
does
she
get
fees
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
the
district
court
--
is
the
district
court
supposed
to
wait
until
the
whole
thing
is
over
before
deciding
the
fee
application?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
the
success
is
preliminary?
you
know,
the
plaintiff
survives
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
plaintiff
survives
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
wins
every
procedural
issue,
wins
a
privilege
issue,
gets
discovery
issues
resolved,
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
loses?
the
plaintiff
has
had--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why?
he
has
had
some
success.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rosenkranz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
is
the
impact
on
your
position
of
our
decision
last
week
in
conkright
v.
frommert?
i
know
you
haven't
had
a
chance
to
brief
it,
but
i'm
also
sure
had
you
a
chance
to
read
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
it
--
one
thing
it
did
emphasize,
that
in
the
typical
case,
the
likely
relief
is
going
to
be
sending
it
back
rather
than
making
a
judicial
decision,
which
--
which
seems
to
me,
then,
that
--
and
then
presumably,
in
most
cases,
the
person
would
prevail
before
the
plan
administrator.
so
given
conkright,
your
position
is
going
to
severely
limit
the
circumstances
under
which
claimants
are
entitled
to
fees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
the
--
as
in
conkright,
the
claimant's
success
can
--
before
an
agreement,
can
be
quite
dramatic.
this
was
a
very,
very
significant
victory
for
the
claimant
to
get
it
sent
back
under
those
circumstances.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
how
it
works?
remands
always
retain
jurisdiction?
i
would
--
i
would
have
thought
the
district
judge
would
want
the
thing
off
his
or
her
docket,
you
know,
for
the
statistics,
if
anything.
and--
[laughter]
--and
would
say,
and
maybe
could
say
--
well,
what
if
the
judge
says:
look,
i
don't
know
if
you're
going
to
prevail
or
not
on
remand.
my
decision
actually
doesn't
help
you
much
one
way
or
the
other,
but
if
you
get
benefits,
then
the
other
side
is
liable
for
attorney's
fees,
and
i
assume
you'll
be
able
to
work
out
the
amount.
if
you
don't,
he's
done.
end
of
case.
sent
back
to
the
administrator.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
parties
--
to
follow
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
line
of
questioning,
what
if
the
parties
decide,
look,
this
case
rises
or
falls
on
the
discovery
issue?
if
we
have
to
go
through
discovery,
it's
going
to
cost
us
a
lot
more
than
to
pay
you.
so
we
stipulate
whatever
the
ruling
is
on
discovery
will
decide
the
issue.
in
that
case,
can
the
party
--
can
the
claimant
get
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
grants
the
discovery
order,
and
as
a
result,
a
direct
result
of
that
ruling,
the
plan
pays
benefits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
ates,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
today
in
case
09-448,
hardt's
versus
reliance
standard
life
insurance
company
and
he
has
asked
that
i
announce
the
opinion.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
petitioner
bridget
hardt's
sued
respondent
reliance
standard
life
insurance
company
after
it
denied
her
request
for
long-term
disability
benefits
under
a
plan
governed
by
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
known
as
erisa.
hardt
and
reliance
filed
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
denied
both
motions
but
found
that
reliance
had
failed
to
give
hardt's
a
claim,
the
full
and
fair
review
that
erisa
requires.
the
district
court
instructed
reliance
to
conduct
a
proper
review
of
hardt's
claim
within
30
days
and
warned
that
if
reliance
failed
to
do
so,
the
court
would
enter
judgment
in
hardt's
favor.
after
reliance
conducted
the
review
as
instructed,
it
awarded
hardt
the
long-term
disability
benefits
she
sought.
hardt
then
moved
the
court
to
award
her
attorney's
fees
under
29
united
states
code
section
1132
(g)1,
a
fee
shifting
statute
that
gives
courts
discretion
to
award
attorney's
fees
to
either
party"
in
most
erisa
lawsuits.
the
district
court
granted
hardt's
motion
for
fees
but
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
judgment
concluding
that
hardt
was
not
eligible
for
fees
under
the
statute
because
the
district
court's
order
instructing
reliance
to
reconsider
hardt's
benefit
claim
did
not
make
hardt
a
prevailing
party.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
term
prevailing
party
is
a
legal
term
of
art,
that
does
not
appear
in
section
1132
(g)1.
the
court
of
appeals
thus
erred
in
holding
that
hardt
had
to
qualify
as
a
prevailing
party
to
receive
a
fee
award.
applying
the
interpretive
method
we
employed
in
a
case
called
ruckelshaus
versus
sierra
club,
we
conclude
that
a
fee
claimant
is
eligible
for
attorney's
fees
under
the
statute
as
long
as
she
has
achieved
some
degree
of
success
on
the
merits
of
her
claim.
once
the
claimant
has
established
eligibility
for
a
fee
award
the
district
court
has
broad
discretion
to
award
fees
under
section
1132
(g)1.
as
more
fully
explained
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
hardt
established
her
eligibility
for
fees
award
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
by
vacating
the
district
court's
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
