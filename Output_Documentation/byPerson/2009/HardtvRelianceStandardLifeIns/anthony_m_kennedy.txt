justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this
district
court
kept
jurisdiction
over
the
action.
he
more
or
less
waited
to
see
how
the
story
came
out
before
he
wrote
the
plot.
suppose
the
district
court
said:
all
you
came
to
me
for
was
an
order
for
remand.
i
give
you
the
order
for
remand.
case
ended.
at
that
point,
he
doesn't
know
how
it's
going
to
come
out.
at
that
point,
can
he
--
can
the
district
court
award
attorney's
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
even
if,
when
it
goes
back
to
reliance,
reliance
finds
that
it's
patently
frivolous,
close
to
a
fraud,
she
--
the
employee
still
gets
the
fee?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
can
see
now
why
the
red
brief
has
a
very
substantial
appendix
with
statutes.
now,
you
say,
oh,
this
is
unique.
well,
then
we
may
have
many,
many
different
kinds
of
statutes.
this
does
not
provide
for
--
this
is
not
a
prevailing
party
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
in
going
through
the
list
of
the
statutes,
there
are
many
statutes
that
are
not
prevailing
party
statutes.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
you
say
it's
unique.
well,
it's
unique
in
the
sense
it's
in
erisa,
but
i
--
i
think
it's
very
close
to
many
--
many
of
the
statutes
with
the
language
there
in
the
red
brief's
appendix.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your
--
under
your
rule
would
it
be
error
for
the
district
court
to
terminate
its
jurisdiction?
it
must
keep
jurisdiction
to
see
how
the
play
comes
out
in
the
end?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
certainly
has
to
in
order
to
adopt
the
ameliorating
factors
that
you
--
that
you
use
in
order
to
justify
this
rule.
and
i
--
i
--
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
courts
usually
retain
jurisdiction
in
these
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
government
in
response
to
questions
about
the
significance
and
the
consequences
of
its
position
said,
oh,
this
is
a
unique
statute.
erisa
--
it's
is
an
erisa
statute.
do
you
agree
that
if
--
if
we
rule
for
you,
it
would
be
applicable
primarily
to
erisa
and
it
wouldn't
have
an
effect
on
these
other
statutes?
