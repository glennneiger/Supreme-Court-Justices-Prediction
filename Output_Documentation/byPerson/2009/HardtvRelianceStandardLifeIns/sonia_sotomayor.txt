justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
define
as
--
assuming
that
we
go
back
to
our
prior
language
and
use
--
in
ruckelshaus,
"some
success
on
the
merits",
what's
the
"some
success
on
the
merits"
that
you
claim
your
client
reached?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
i
believe
that
this
circuit
said,
yes,
there
are
cases
where
we
have
so
held,
but
that's
because
there
was
a
cause
of
action
under
the
complaint
that
--
that
alleged
a
violation
of
the
act.
but
here
there
wasn't.
here,
there
was
a
claim
for
benefits
only,
and
you
didn't
get
benefits.
that
was
the
circuit's
reasoning.
so
tell
me
where
they
erred
and
how
we
go
back
to
defining
"some
success
on
the
merits"
in
light
of
that
position
by
the
circuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
you
think
our
--
the
meaning
of
our
footnote,
chief
justice
rehnquist's
footnote
in
ruckelshaus,
who
said
a
procedural
victory
is
not
some
success
on
the
merits.
how
do
you
differentiate
what
he
meant
by
a
--
some
procedural
victory
is
not
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
could
somebody
have
some
success
on
the
merits
if
they
don't
achieve
a
judgment
of
some
sort?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
under
your
theory,
presumably
no
relief
has
to
be
granted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
then
what
--
what's
the
difference
--
is
it
your
theory
that
if
the
district
court
--
for
whatever
reason,
if
this
wasn't
an
erisa
case
where
a
remand
--
or
where
the
court
said
they
did
violate,
but
i've
now
looked
at
the
evidence
that
you're
proffering,
the
new
evidence
they
did
not
consider,
and
it's
not
enough
for
benefits;
you
don't
get
it.
is
your
argument
that
you
are
entitled
to
fees
because
they
decided
there
was
--
the
court
decided
there
was
a
violation
of
erisa?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
what's
the
difference
between
hanrahan,
where
there's
a
violation
of
the
civil
procedure
code
which
is
an
entitlement
to
process?
why
aren't
you
successful,
if
this
is
a
non-erisa
situation,
merely
for
a
finding
that
the
district
court
acted
improperly?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
whether
you
differ
in
your
definition
of
"some
success
on
the
merits"
than
your
predecessor
colleague?
do
you
define
it
as
in
the
manner
he
did,
that
it's
any
legal
judgment
in
the
petitioner's
favor
that
another
party
has
done
a
wrongful
act?
i
think
--
i
think
i'm
summarizing
his
position
accurately.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
that's
different
than
what
he
said.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
yes,
here
there
was
an
order
of
remand.
that's
clear.
and
i
can
understand
the
difference
between
an
order,
because
there
are
many
decisions
of
the
court
that
end
up
in
orders
that
are
not
final
judgments.
but
there
are
decisions,
like
this
one,
i
think
according
to
him,
that
if
the
district
court
had
said
there
was
a
violation
of
erisa
and
the
parties
then
settled
without
a
judicial
order
reflecting
that
finding
and/or
requiring
a
remand,
i
think
according
to
him
he
would
say
this
party
was
entitled
to
fees.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
didn't
assume
this
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
order,
just
a
finding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
then
a
settlement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
seems
like
a
catalyst
theory,
and
that
was,
at
least
in
dicta,
rejected
in
--
in
ruckelshaus.
so
how
do
you
deal
with
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
his
point
--
your
adversary's
point
--
is
the
court
couldn't
effect
that
procedural
move
without
taking
step
one
in
what
was
requested.
it
had
to
find
some
sort
of
violation,
either
to
remand
or
to
grant
benefits,
so
that
the
relief
sought,
by
definition,
needed
a
finding
by
the
court.
and
your
adversary
says
the
court
found
an
erisa
violation.
now,
the
type
of
relief
it
grants
is
up
to
its
discretion.
this
is
an
equitable
situation,
and
it
exercised
its
discretion
by
doing
a
remand.
why
is
that
view
different
than
calling
it
a
procedural
step?
isn't
that
a
substantive
win?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
that's
difficult.
let's
assume
that
a
claims
administrator
or
a
plan
administrator
is
not
deciding
the
claim.
the
party
comes
to
court
and
says:
under
erisa,
i
have
a
right
to
a
decision
within
x
number
of
days;
force
them,
mandamus
them
to
give
me
a
decision.
the
court
says:
reasonable;
you
have
a
right
to
one.
and
orders
them
to.
under
your
theory,
they've
won
nothing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
--
you're
--
wait
a
minute.
then
we
go
back
to
a
question
that
was
asked
by
one
of
my
colleagues.
if
a
plan
participant
came
in
and
said
they
didn't
consider
evidence
they
should
have;
they
didn't
seek
my
treating
physician's
documents,
and
here
they
are;
they
should
consider
them
now,
and
the
court
says
you're
right,
enters
a
remand
order,
and
dismisses
the
case
--
that's
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what
--
what's
the
difference
between
the
first
example
i
gave,
a
mandamus
to
issue
a
decision
--
that's
not
a
claim
for
benefits,
either;
it's
a
claim
for
a
decision.
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
the
second
hypothetical?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
is
the
difference
between
prevailing
party
and
some
success
on
the
merits
for
you?
the
only
difference
is
whether
they
won
on
one
cause
of
action
as
opposed
to
four?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
under
buckhannon,
51
percent
only
entitles
you
to
fees.
and
under
your
view
of
this
statute,
you
have
--
as
long
as
you
get
1
percent
order,
that's
enough.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
--
you
see
no
difference
today?
