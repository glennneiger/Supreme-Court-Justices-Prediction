mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court
found
that
respondent's
original
decision
denying
benefits
disregarded
pertinent
medical
evidence
in
violation
of
erisa
and
found
that
the
decision
was
otherwise
unsupported
by
substantial
evidence.
based
on
those
findings,
the
district
court
ordered
respondent
to
make
a
new
benefits
determination,
after
which
respondent
finally
granted
the
benefits
due.
those
facts
established
petitioner's
eligibility
for
a
fee
award
under
erisa
section
502(g)(1),
which
authorizes
a
court
to
award
reasonable
attorney's
fees,
quote,
"in
its
discretion",
end
quote.
that
discretion,
as
per
erisa
more
generally,
is
to
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
well-established
trust
law
principles,
and
those
principles
quite
clearly
reject
a
strict
prevailing
party
standard--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
i
--
i
think
we
are
in
an
agreement,
your
honor,
with
--
with
--
with
petitioner's
characterization.
when
there's
a
judicial
order
finding
a
violation--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
don't
want
to
characterize
his
view,
but
here's
our
view
on
--
on
"some
success
on
the
merits".
if
the
order
--
to
be
concrete
about
it,
the
order
in
this
case
--
assuming
this
case,
all
that--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--pardon?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
so
there's
a
finding
of
an
erisa
violation,
period?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
and
then
a
settlement.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
on
which
framework
we're
operating
under.
i
think
if
we're
operating
under
well-established
trust
law
principles,
that
clearly
qualifies
as
enough
success
to
justify
a
fee
award.
and
we
can
look
at
several
of
the
trust
cases
cited
in
both
our
brief
and
petitioner's
brief.
in
re
catell's
estate
is
discussed
in
all
the
briefs.
there
the
plaintiff
brought
a
claim
to
remove
a
trustee,
and
the
basis
for
the
claim
to
remove
the
trustee
was
a
contention
that
the
trustee
wasn't
complying
with
one
of
the
terms
of
the
trust.
after
he
filed
the
suit
--
and
this
was
before
even
any
finding
by
the
judge
--
the
trustee
then
complied
with
that
particular
term
of
the
trust.
and
then
what
the
court
said
was,
well,
because
the
trustee
complied
with
the
underlying
premise
or
the
motivation
for
your
suit,
i'm
going
to
deny
your
claim
to
have
the
trustee--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
it
wasn't
--
in
the
dictum
in
ruckelshaus;
it
was
actually
accepted,
your
honor,
in
that
--
in
the
footnote
the
court
--
in
the
dictum
within
ruckelshaus,
the
court
says
quite
plainly
that
congress,
in
departing
from
a
strict
prevailing
party
language
in
ruckelshaus,
meant
to
embrace
judicial
--
relief
that
wasn't
encapsulated
within
a
judicial
order.
but
we're
far
afield
from
ruckelshaus
here,
because
we
actually
have
a
judicial
order,
and
we're
far
afield
from
the
outer
limits
of
the
trust
--
trust
law
cases
which
--
which,
for
example,
in
re
catell's
estate,
which
i
just
mentioned
--
and
by
no
means
is
in
re
catell's
estate
an
outlier.
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
dardovitch,
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief,
recounts
in
re
catell's
estate
as
falling
well
within
the
history
of
trust
law
cases.
petitioner's
reply
brief
at
page
11
cites
grien
v.
cavano.
that's
another
case
where
a
plaintiff
brought
--
brought
a
claim
that
a
union
fund
was
not
complying
with
accounting
and
proper
bookkeeping
procedures.
after
he
filed
the
suit,
they
fell
in
line,
adopted
the
various
procedures
that
plaintiff
had
sought,
and
the
court
still
said:
drawing
upon
trust
law
principles,
we're
going
to
award
fees.
now,
again,
i
don't
think
the
court
has--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
a
couple
of
responses:
first
of
all,
erisa
is
somewhat
unique
in
that
erisa
--
first
of
all,
this
provision
doesn't
have
prevailing
party
language
as
--
unlike
eaja,
for
example--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
still
this
provision
is
unique
in
that
it's
informed
explicitly
by
trust
law
principles,
as
this
court
has
held
numerous
--
in
numerous
decisions
regarding
other
erisa
provisions.
and
the
trust
law
principles
depart
from
the
american
rule.
all
of
those
other
statutes
which
you
have
in
mind,
justice
scalia,
are
premised
on
the
background
of
the
american
rule.
the
trust
law
departs
from
american
rule,
and
so
when
you
interpret
erisa
section
502(g)(1)
based
upon
the
trust
law
principles,
i
think
that
supports
a
different--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
even--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
a
fee
provision
enacted
within
erisa
which
explicitly
states
as
one
of
its
purposes
to
protect
beneficiaries
and
to
provide
them
access
to
courts.
this
is
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
correct.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
and,
your
honor,
previously
the
government
has
made
narrow
arguments.
for
example,
there
were
arguments--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--under
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
a
district
court
would
be
within
its
jurisdiction
to
deny
attorney's
fees.
that
doesn't--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--he
wouldn't--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--probably
not
in
application.
he
would
be
eligible,
but
a
district
court--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
but
a
district
court
applying--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no,
your
honor,
because
that
would
be
captured
within
hanrahan,
we
think,
and
that's
--
and
that's
easily
distinguishable
because
those
are
errors
--
even
if
some
of
those
procedural
victories
were
overturned
on
appeal
or
procedural
losses
were
overturned
on
appeal,
those
are
all
errors
within
the
court
system
or
victories
within
the
procedures
of
the
court
system,
not
a
violation
of
--
on
the
merits
of
the
underlying
claim,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
erisa
and
then
relief
ordered
to--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well
--
well,
your
honor,
no.
i
think
our
--
our
--
our
argument
is
to
interpret
it
in
light
of
trust
law
principles.
now,
the
trust
law
cases
--
there
is
language
in
some
of
the
trust
laws
cases
that
suggests
that
fees
--
fees
could
be
awarded
to
unsuccessful
litigants
or
regardless
of
outcome.
but
i
think
if
you
read
those
cases,
on
the
facts
of
those
cases
they
don't
go
that
far.
but
i
think
what
they
do
embody
is
a
much
broader
notion
of
success
than
the
strict
prevailing
party
jurisprudence
that
this
court
has
promulgated--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no
--
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
must
keep
jurisdiction.
but
certainly
in
a
case
where
it
does
retain--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--may
i
respond,
your
honor?
a
couple
of
responses,
justice
kennedy:
first,
if
they
didn't
retain
jurisdiction
--
and
in
the
seventh
circuit,
for
example,
that's
one
circuit
which
says
that
these
orders
have
to
be
final,
and
final
judgment
has
to
be
entered
--
then
we're
exactly
analogous
to
a
sentence
4
social
security
case.
and
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
a
line
of
decisions
that
upon
entry
of
final
judgment
--
and
those
are
exactly
analogous
in
the
sense
that
what
happens
is
that
the
court
finds
that
the
decision
below
committed
some
error
in
law,
it
vacates
that
decision,
and
then
sends
it
back
to
the
social
security
administration
for
a
new
determination
without
preordaining
the
result.
regardless
of
the
result
there,
at
the
time
of
the
remand
and
entry
of
judgment,
that
plaintiff
is
eligible
for
--
for
fees.
we
think
that
the
same
outcome
would
be
controlled
here,
even
if
the
court
applied
its
strict
prevailing
party
jurisprudence.
thank
you.
