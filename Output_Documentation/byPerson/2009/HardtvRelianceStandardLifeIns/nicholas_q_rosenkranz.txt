mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
no
judge
has
ever
decided
the
merits
of
petitioner's
claim
for
benefits.
under
this
court's
holding
in
ruckelshaus,
the
petitioner
must
demonstrate
some
success
on
the
merits,
and
under
rule
54
she
must
specify
the
judgment
entitling
her
to
an
award.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
footnote
8
of
ruckelshaus
addressed
one
sentence
of
legislative
history
of
a
different
statute,
and
only
so
far
as
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
sentence
was
of
no
use
to
sierra
club
in
that
case.
i
don't
think
the
footnote
is
properly
read
to
be
a
full-fledged
endorsement
of
the
catalyst
theory.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
would
be
an
utterly
unadministrable
rule
to
attempt
to
weigh
the
inclinations
of
district
judges
in
their
opinions.
this
court's
precedents
have
made
clear
that
we
weigh
success
on
the
merits
by
evaluating
judicial
judgments.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
your
honor,
petitioner
in
this
case,
like
all
plaintiffs,
arrived
in
court
requesting
a
judgment,
a
judgment
awarding
her
benefits.
indeed,
she
believed
she
was
entitled
to
such
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
she
moved
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
summary
judgment.
what
the
district
court
actually
did
was
deny
that
motion
for
summary
judgment.
rather
than
give
her
the
judgment
she
sought,
the
district
court
employed
a
particular
procedural
maneuver,
which
was
to
remand
the
case
--
quote,
"remand
the
case"
--
to
her
litigation
adversary
to
reconsider
the
question.
now--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
this
is
a
purely
interlocutory
order.
so
this
was
not
an
end
to
the
case.
this
was
not
a
decision
on
the
merits.
this
was
a
purely
interlocutory
order,
on
the
road
to
a
decision
on
the
merits,
perhaps,
but
the
district
court
denied
her
motion
for
summary
judgment,
did
not
conclude
that
she
was
entitled
to
benefits
as
a
matter
of
law
and,
instead,
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
so--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
conkright
emphasizes
that
these
judgments
are
to
be
made
in
the
first
instance
and,
in
fact,
in
the
second
instance
by
claims
administrators,
that
that
is--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
it's
--
you
are
correct
that
in
conkright,
the
court
--
court
indicated
that
in
most
cases
the
district
court
should
remand
under
circumstances
like
this.
you
are
quite
correct.
under
circumstances
like
this,
then,
there
would
be
fewer
opportunities
for
district
courts
to
award
--
to
award
fees.
and
that's
a
correct
result
under
502(g)(1),
which,
as
informed
by--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
this
should
be
characterized
as
a
victory.
this
is
not
a
procedural
maneuver
that
the
plaintiff
sought.
the
plaintiff
asked
for
summary
judgment,
and
her
summary
judgment
motion
was
denied.
and,
instead,
the
district
court
chose
to
remand
the
case
to
her
litigation
adversary.
surely,
at
that
moment
at
least,
that
surely
could
not
have
felt
like
a
victory--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--i
don't
think
that
future
claimants
will
ask
for
a
remand
as
their
final
form
of
relief,
your
honor.
this
was
--
the
relief
that
one
asks
for
in
one's
complaint
is
the
final
judicial
relief
that
one
wants.
this
is--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
a
plaintiff
could
get
an
--
could
get
the
relief
of
benefits
if
a
claims
administrator
had
acted
severely
improperly
or
in
very
bad
faith.
a
district
court
still
has
power
to
issue
an
award
on
summary
judgment--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--but
the
correct
way
to--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor.
a
properly
framed
complaint
under
erisa
should
still
be
a
claim
for
benefits.
the
--
the
remand
that
conkright
contemplates
is
still
an
interlocutory
remand,
like
the
remand
here.
one
does
not
put
in
one's
complaint
a
desire
for
interlocutory
relief,
any
more
than
one
asks--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
a
remand
order
under
those
circumstances
might
constitute
success
on
the
merits
because
it
resolves
an
issue
in
the
case,
which
was
liability
in
the
case.
so
that
perhaps
would
constitute
success
on
the
merits.
this
resolved
no
substantive
issue
on
the
case.
this
remand
order
simply
says:
as
a
procedural
matter,
go
back
and
look
at
it
again.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor,
this
court
has
--
this
court
has
expressly
distinguished
between
judicial--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
the
difference
between
judicial
pronouncements
and
judicial
relief
is
one
that
this
court
has--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor,
in
your
hypothetical
the
--
the
remand
order
would
presumably
be
a
final
judgment,
and
it
might
well
constitute
success
on
the
merits.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
properly
formatted
erisa
complaint.
if
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
is
"i
want
my
benefits"
then--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--if
the
--
if
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
is
a
complaint
for
benefits,
then
the
complaint
should
ask
for
benefits,
and
the
judge
should
resolve
that
case.
a
remand
would
always
maintain
jurisdiction
--
should
always
maintain
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
thus
always
be
interlocutory
and
procedural.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
your
honor,
on
the
research
that
we
have
done,
most
district
courts
hold
jurisdiction
on
remands
such
as
this,
and
we
believe
that
is
the
proper
course.
when
the
case
--
the
gravamen
of
the
case
is
a
complaint
for
benefits,
the
district
court
merely
remands
to
the
erisa
claims
administrator,
the
merits
of
the
case
simply
have
not
been
decided.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i
believe
that
would
be
to
embrace
the
catalyst
theory
that
this
court
rejected
in
2000--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the
court
was
careful
in
ruckelshaus
to
say
that
a
purely
procedural
victory
would
not
suffice.
now,
purely
procedural
victory
may
well
--
may
well
result
in
success
for
a
plaintiff
at
some
later
stage;
it
could
result
in
out-of-court
success.
this
court
has
been
crystal
clear
that
we
do
not
look
for
success
out
of
court;
we
don't
look
for
it
in
interlocutory
orders--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--on
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
an
interlocutory
order.
so
if
a
plaintiff
arrives
seeking
only
documents
and
the
district
court
awards
her,
her
documents,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case,
and
the
district
court
would
properly
relinquish
jurisdiction,
and
we
could
evaluate,
compare
the
result
that
the
district
court
gave
--
gave
a
plaintiff
with
what
the
plaintiff
originally
asked
for.
but
this
is
not
such
a
case.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
your
honor,
it
might
be
proper
to
frame
a
complaint
under
erisa
for
a
purely
procedural
remedy
like
some
documents.
that
is
not
the
main
run
of
erisa
cases.
so
in
the
normal
case,
a
petitioner
arrives
--
a
plaintiff
arrives
asking
for
benefits.
and--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--i'm
not
sure
that
a
properly
framed
erisa
complaint
would
be
--
would
be
for
a
purely
procedural
result.
if
one
could
frame
an
erisa
claim
like
that,
which
i
think
is
extremely--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
in
this
case
the
remand
order
was
both
purely
procedural
and
interlocutory.
so
it
fails
under
both
those
grounds.
on
your
hypothetical,
the
--
the
order
would
be
a
final
order,
but
presumably
still
purely
procedural,
and
so
perhaps
not
success
on
the
merits
even
on
that
hypothetical.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
your
honor,
it
would
qualify
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
a
final
judgment,
not
an
interlocutory
order.
whether
that's
properly
characterized
as
a
purely
procedural
victory
or
not,
i'm
not
sure.
most
erisa
claims
are
not
framed
that
way.
they
are
usually
framed
as
claims
for
benefits,
not
for
purely
procedural--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--again,
your
honor,
that
would
perhaps
be
best
characterized
as
a
purely
procedural
victory
even
though
it's
a
final
judgment
and
even
though
it's
what
the
plaintiff
sought.
again,
in
this
case,
this
order
was
purely
interlocutory,
and
so
it's
a
much
easier
case.
this
--
in
this
case,
this
was
a
procedural
step
on
the
road
to
a
final
judgment.
this
was
not
a
final
judgment
at
all
and
not
at
all
what
the
petitioner
sought.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
no,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't.
the
court
has
oftentimes
emphasized
that
fee-shifting
statutes
ought
to
be
read
in
parallel,
that
we
ought
to
have
fewer
rather
than
more
fee-shifting
standards
in
the
world.
and
so,
presumably,
the
result
in
this
case
would
govern
any
number
of
fee-shifting
statutes
of
similar
language.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
in
this
hypothetical,
the
district
court
grants
the
discovery
order,
but
the
--
but
still
holds
jurisdiction
over
the
case?
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
this
court
has
rejected
the
direct
results
theory
and
has
instructed
us
to
look
at
the
content
of
judicial
judgments,
not
at
their
ancillary
effects
on
parties
out
in
the
world.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
your
honor,
in
ruckelshaus,
the
courts
emphasized
that
omitting
words
like
"prevailing
party"
or
"success"
from
a
statute
is
significant,
but
it's
not
revolutionary,
that
what
it
accomplishes
is
a
decrease
in
the
quantum
of
success
required
--
the
degree,
i
believe
was
the
court's
language
--
but
not
the
type
of
success
required.
but
it
was
still--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the
--
the
court
in
ruckelshaus
was
speaking
of
the
interpretation
of
1970s.
at
that
time,
"prevailing
party"
had
been
read
quite
narrowly
to
require
substantially
prevailing,
and
the
court
understood
congress
to
reject
that
standard
in
adopting
a
statute
that
doesn't
include
language
like
"prevailing
party".
subsequently,
this
court
has
adopted
a
much
more
liberal
understanding
of
the
words
"prevailing
party",
so
there
may
not
be--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--there
may
still
be
a
difference,
but
it
will
be
a
smaller
difference
and
a
difference
only
in
quantity,
certainly
not
a
difference
in
type.
the
result
--
the
success
still
has
to
be
success
that
you
can
find
in
a
judgment
of
a
court.
your
honors,
if
i
could
--
your
honors,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
this
will
result
in
--
that
--
i'm
sorry.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
plaintiffs
--
or
the
petitioner's
rule
would
result
in
a
second
major
litigation
over
attorney's
fees,
and
this
court
has
rejected
any
such
rules.
the
concern
is
that
the
fee-shifting
inquiry
ought
to
be
simple
and
easy
to
administer.
the
ease
of
administrability
of
our
rule
is
that
it
turns
on
the
contents
of
judicial
judgments.
if
the
petitioner
wins
in
this
case,
the
policy
result
will
merely
be
stingier
plans.
so
these
are
not
plans
that
any
private
party
is
obliged
to
create,
and
this
court
has
emphasized
that
the
purpose
of
erisa
is
to
balance
the
interests
of
beneficiaries,
on
the
one
hand,
but
also
the
interest
in
the
creation
of
these
plans
and
the
generosity
of
these
plans,
on
the
other.
and
a
fee
award
under
circumstances
like
this
would
result
in
far
less
generous
plans
for
--
for--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
the
solicitor
general
is
here
arguing
that
this
ought
to
be
the
rule,
and
it
would
presumably
be
the
same
rule
even
in
a
statute
that
applied
against
the
government.
again,
this
court
has
cautioned
against
a
proliferation
of
different
fee-shifting
standards.
i
would
think
there
would
be
a
concern
about
having
a
different
standard
applied
to
the
government
than
to
a
private
party
on
--
on
similar
statutory
text.
certainly,
no
indication
in
this
statutory
text--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
seems
artificial
in
a
way
to
apply
those
--
to
apply
--
to
import
those
principles
entirely.
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
erisa
is
informed
by
trust
principles.
and
under
sprague,
the
court
emphasized
that
trust
principles
would
very
rarely
shift
fees
in
a
context
like
this.
so
to
that
extent,
i
do
believe
that
this
provision
should
be
informed
by
this
court's
holding
on
that
point.
just
to
re-emphasize,
your
honors,
what
actually
happened
in
the
district
court
below:
so
the
petitioners
sought
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
benefits,
and
that
motion
was
denied.
instead,
she
received
an
interlocutory
procedural
order,
a
remand
to
her
adversary,
a
private
party
in
litigation,
to
consider
the
question
again.
and,
as
this
court
emphasized,
the
second
inquiry
by
the
claims
administrator
would
be
reviewed
for
abuse
of
discretion.
it
could
easily
have
come
out
the
other
way,
as
the
district
court
itself
acknowledged.
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
the
district
court
specified
that
if
reliance
did
not
comply
with
this
procedural--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
true,
but
i
don't
think
that
distinguishes
this
from--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
she
didn't
actually
get
a
judgment.
she
got
a--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i
think
that's
only
--
the
district
court
was
only
saying
what
is
implicit
in
most
all
procedural
orders--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--but,
your
honor,
if
a
party
ignores
the
procedural
order
of
a
district
court,
it
does
so
often
on
peril
of
default.
so
it--
mr.
nicholas
q.
rosenkranz
--again,
your
honor,
the
district
court
did
not
decide
the
merits
of
this
case.
the
district
court
offered
the
possibility
that
it
would
enter
judgment
if
something
happened
in
the
future.
that
thing
did
not
happen
in
the
future.
there
was
no
judgment
in
her
favor
in
this
case.
again,
the
issue
was
remanded
to
a
private
party
to
determine
the
issue.
the
grant
of
benefits
on
remand
certainly
could
not
constitute
success
on
the
merits.
that
was
not
judicial
action
at
all.
that
was
the
action
of
a
private
party.
purely
voluntary
action.
certainly,
couldn't
constitute
a
judgment
under
rule
54.
and
then
when
the
case
arrived
back
at
the
district
court,
the
district
court
did
the
only
thing
that
it
was
left
to
do,
which
was
to
dismiss
the
case.
and
those
are
the
actual
actions
the
district
court
took:
denying
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissing
the
case.
and
under
this
court's
precedents,
where
we
look
for
success
is
in
those
judgments.
those
judgments
show
us
no
success
on
the
merits
for
ms.
hardt.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
