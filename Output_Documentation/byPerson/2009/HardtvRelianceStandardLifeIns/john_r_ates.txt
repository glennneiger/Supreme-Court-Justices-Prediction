mr.
john
r.
ates
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fourth
circuit
vacated
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
petitioner
hardt
even
though
the
district
court
found
respondent
violated
erisa
in
bad
faith
and
required
respondent
to
redetermine
benefits
within
30
days
or
face
adverse
judgment.
and
ms.
hardt
then
secured
the
full
disability
benefits
after
that
court-enforceable
order.
ms.
hardt
is
entitled
to
--
is
eligible
for
a
fee
award
under
section
502(g)(1)
of
erisa
by
proper
application
of
this
court's
established
fee
standards
under
any
test
this
court
has
previously
established.
but
to
be
clear--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--in
that
instance,
the
erisa
violation
in
this
instance.
mr.
john
r.
ates
they
misread
the
complaint,
justice
sotomayor.
we
are
claiming
a
claim
for
benefits.
as
part
of
that
claim,
we
asked
for
equitable
relief
for
the
erisa
violation.
the
heart
of
erisa
is
the
full
and
fair
review
process
in
1133
of
the
statute.
because
without
a
full
and
fair
review
by
the
plan
administrator,
that
fiduciary
cannot
get
to
the
right
result.
it
violated
that
obligation
here.
we
asked
for
the
benefits,
but
the
district
court,
instead
of
awarding
the
benefits,
said
in
the
first
--
in
the
second
instance,
here's
your
second
bite
at
the
apple;
get
it
right
this
time.
that's
success
on
the
merits
under
erisa,
because
they
must
abide
by
their
fiduciary
obligations,
and
they
breached
it
here.
the
relief
the
district
court
formulated
in
essence
was
an
equitable-type
relief:
do
it
again.
we
asked
for
that
in
the
complaint.
we
asked
for
equitable
relief--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--i
think
it
foreshadowed
the
hanrahan-type
case,
and
we
are
miles
apart
from
hanrahan.
hanrahan,
which
respondent
is
relying
upon,
was
the
circuit
court
reversing
the
district
court
on
a
pure
civil
procedure
issue.
here,
there
is
a
--
a
right;
it
is
a
process
right.
so
when
the
process
right
is
violated,
your
relief
is
going
to
necessarily
be
process-driven.
mr.
john
r.
ates
but,
in
hanrahan,
there
was
no
finding
of
a
violation
of
law,
justice
scalia.
here
we
have
a
violation
of
erisa,
a
violation
of
a
fiduciary
obligation
by
the
plan
administrator.
the
relief
accorded
for
that
violation
was
a
remand
back
to
the
plan
administrator
to
get
it
right.
that's
the
difference
between
our
case
and
hanrahan.
in
hanrahan,
there
was
no
finding
of
a
violation
of
law.
no
one
was
found
to
be
a
legal
wrongdoer.
we
have
that
here.
the
fiduciary
breached
its
obligation.
mr.
john
r.
ates
i'm
sorry--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--well,
what
happened
was
the
district
court,
i
believe,
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
a
motion
for
judgment
as
of
law
at
trial.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
that.
what
we
have
here
is
a
prodding
from
a
court,
but
moreover
a
finding
of
a
violation
by
a
court.
the
court
found
reliance
violated
erisa.
that's
the
key
distinction
between
here
and
hanrahan.
and--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--no.
under
our
position,
the
--
ms.
hardt
is
eligible
for
fees
and
the
district
court
can
take
into
account
trust
law
principles
which
are
embodied
in
what
we
call
this
five-factor
test
to
determine
whether
to
award
fees.
she's
eligible
for
fees
based
on
the
violation
by
reliance
in
bad
faith.
we
have
a
legal
wrongdoer
here.
the
amount
of
those
fees,
justice
ginsburg,
may
be
determined
in
part
by
her
degree
of
success.
mr.
john
r.
ates
absolutely,
the
court
at
that
point,
if
he's
closing
the
case
out
in
particular
and
entering
judgment
as
to
the
violation--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--the
only
way
it's
going
back,
justice
kennedy,
is
from
a
violation
of
law.
so,
in
that
regard,
she
has
succeeded
on
the
merits
by
proving
a
violation
regardless
of
the
outcome
at
the
end
of
the
day.
now,
here
certainly
she
got
the
benefits,
so
we
--
we
meet
even
buckhannon
and
beyond.
but
in
the
case
where
the
district
court
is
sending
it
back,
it
must
be
sending
it
back
for
a
violation
of
law,
save
one
instance.
the
claimant
comes
forward
and
says:
i
have
additional
evidence
that
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
submit
below.
i've
got
an
equitable
ground
to
--
to
convince
the
court
to,
in
essence,
reopen
the
record.
i
want
--
i
want
to
send
it
back.
in
that
instance,
fees
should
not
be
awarded
because
it
was
the
claimant's
fault
in
not
getting
this
record
--
this
record
evidence
in.
mr.
john
r.
ates
again--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--maybe
i
am,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
my
point
is
to
try
to
distinguish
hanrahan,
in
the
sense
that
we
have
a
judicial
finding
of
a
legal
violation
here.
what
i
was
trying
to
articulate
earlier,
perhaps
inartfully,
was
that
she
--
she's
eligible
for
fees
under
the
five-factor
test,
but
in
that
instance
the
district
court
is
not
likely
to
use
its
discretion
to
grant
fees
in
that
instance.
i
was
not--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--it
--
it
depends
on
what
the
district
court
does
with
it.
but
she
has
to
prove
a
violation
of
erisa
for
it
to
go
back.
and
if
she
proves
that,
she's
eligible
for
fees.
and
the
district
court
in
its
discretion
can
take
all
these
factors
into
account--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--i
think
the
better
practice
is
for
the
district
court
to
hold
the
case
over
and
supervise
the
remand.
but
if
the
district
court
enters
judgment
at
that
point,
then
--
then
under
rule
54
or
the
--
they
have
to
come
in
and
apply
for
fees
within
14
days
of
that
judgment.
but
this
case
does
not
give
this
court
an
opportunity
specifically
to
give
the
courts,
district
courts,
guidance
whether
to
keep
these
cases
open
or
not,
much
like
the
social
security
cases
that
happened
in
the
late
'80s
and
early
'90s.
but
to
get
back
to
our
main
point,
which
is
this
is
not
a
prevailing
party
statute,
that
was
the
fundamental
error
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
imposing
a
prerequisite
to
determining
whether
a
claimant
is
entitled
to
fees.
section
502(g)(1)
is
not
a
prevailing
party
statute
for
three
primary
reasons:
first,
the
language
and
structure
of
the
statute.
the
words
502(g)(1),
but
it
is
in
other
sections
of
erisa.
its
statutory
sibling,
section
502(g)(2),
contains
a
judgment
requirement.
another
provision
of
erisa,
1451(e),
uses
the
terms
"prevailing
party".
mr.
john
r.
ates
this
case
--
in
the
--
in
the
bradley
case,
which
was
cited
in
hanrahan,
said
you
have
many
final
orders
in
a
case,
and
if
the
court
determines
an
issue
of
--
a
particular
issue
in
a
case
--
and
here
it's
finding
an
erisa
violation
--
and
as
relief
for
that
they
are
issuing
an
order
requiring
reliance
to
act
within
30
days,
let's
say
the
case
settles
at
that
point.
that's
enough
for
fees
to
issue
should
the
parties
not
be
able
to
agree
on
fees
as
a
part
of
the
settlement.
it's
the
judicial
act
in
finding
the
violation
that
triggers
--
triggers
the
success
on
the
merits.
and
this
case
was
on
the
merits.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
very
yellow
brief,
the
district
court--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--relief
does
not
have
to
be
granted.
the
district
court--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--yes,
it
is.
my
argument
is
you're
eligible
for
fees,
and
the
amount
of
fees
will
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
degree
in
the
district
court,
taking
these
five
factors
into
account,
taking
into
effect
your
position
on
the
merits,
the
defendant's
position
on
the
merits,
and
determining
what
that
fee
award
should
be.
but
it
should
not
operate
as
a
barrier
to
getting
into
an
eligibility
question.
so
she's
eligible
for
fees
in
that
instance,
but
what
those
fees
should
be
is
at
the
district
court's
discretion--
mr.
john
r.
ates
--because
you
have
to
look
at
the
party
who
is
violating.
here
it's
the
party
who's
violating
the
law.
it's
a
party
to
the
suit
who
is
violating
the
law.
that
violation
is
found
in
hanrahan.
it's
a
civil
procedure.
the
district
court
didn't
--
didn't
do
something
right.
here
--
and
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
--
of
law.
that's
a
--
that's
a
misapplication
of
a
civil
--
of
a
rule
of
civil
procedure.
here
we
have
a
violation
of
law
by
a
party.
that's
the
fundamental
difference
between
us
and
hanrahan.
mr.
john
r.
ates
the
district
court
can
exercise
its
discretion
and
not
award
fees.
i
think,
however,
that
the
better
result
is
when
a
violation
of
law
is
proven,
the
plaintiff
or
in
this
instance
a
claimant
or
beneficiary
should
be
entitled
to
some
amount
of
fees
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
explicitly
stated
in
the
statute,
is
to
protect
beneficiaries
and
claimants
and
have
access
to
the
federal
courts.
if
every
case
is
a
close
case
and
you're
not
giving
--
giving
fees,
then
--
these
are
folks
of
limited
means.
these
are
folks
by
definition
cannot
work
when
they
are
disabled,
and
you
are
eating
up
their
benefit
through
attorney's
fees.
and
that
cannot
be
the
point
of
the
statute
when
congress
enacted
this.
it
is
to
protect
beneficiaries,
to
give
appropriate
--
give
appropriate
relief
and
keep
open
access
to
the
federal
courts.
if
i
can
get
back
to,
again,
why
this
is
not
a
prevailing
party
statute,
the
language
and
structure
clearly
show
that.
the
history
and
context
show
it
as
well.
and
i'm
not
talking
legislative
history.
i'm
talking
about
the
fact
that
erisa
supplanted
the
welfare
and
pension
plans
disclosure
act,
which
required
a
judgment
before
fees
could
issue,
but
congress
chose
to
remove
that
requirement
when
it
originally
enacted--
erisa.
it
does
not
have
that
judgment
language
and
does
not
have
prevailing
party
language.
moreover,
this
court
repeatedly
has
held
that
trust
law
should
inform
the
interpretation
of
erisa.
trust
law,
for
hundreds
of
years,
has
taken
into
account
these
principles
that
the
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
have
relied
on
for
at
least
30
years
under
erisa
to
inform,
guide,
and
limit
district
courts'
discretion
in
awarding
fees.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
r.
ates
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
two
points
on
rebuttal:
under
their
we
must
have
a
final
judgment
on
the
benefits
on
her
claim
for
--
final
judgment
on
the
merits
on
her
claim
for
benefits,
that
is
absolutely
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decision
in
schaefer,
where
a
social
security
claimant
comes
forward,
shows
a
violation
by
the
secretary;
it's
remanded
back
to
the
secretary;
the
case
is
closed
at
that
point.
there
was
no
decision
on
the
merits
for
the
benefits,
and
yet
this
court
found
that
was
prevailing
party.
here,
we
don't
need
prevailing
party,
but
moreover,
even
accepting
their
theory,
it
leads
to
absurd
results.
there
is
a
provision
in
erisa,
1132(c),
that
gives
a
claimant
the
right
to
seek
documents.
and
yet,
they
are
saying
if
the
claimant
is
wholly
successful
to
get
the
plan
document
from
which
certain
claims
you
don't
even
know
if
you
have
until
you
read
those
plans,
they
would
say
it's
a
purely
procedural
victory;
you
cannot
get
attorney's
fees.
the
whole
point
of
that
provision
was
to
require
the
fiduciary
to
give
the
document
over
so
people
can
understand
their
rights.
moreover,
their
final
judgment
on
the
merits
for
benefits
rule
leads
to
perverse
incentives
under
erisa.
the
plan
administrator
is
incented
to
deny
the
first
time
around,
challenge
it
all
the
way
through
the
courts,
on
remand
maybe,
if
they
get
a
conditional
judgment,
as
here,
that
says
if
you
don't
act
within
30
days
i'm
giving
you
that
judgment,
they
then
grant
the
benefits
and
the
court
gets
rid
of
the
case,
they
have
succeeded
in
eliminating
the
right
of
claimants
to
get
to
court
to
pursue
their
rights,
because
of
the
cost
of
litigation.
but
moreover,
here
we
have
a
judgment.
to
be
clear,
that
is
not
our
argument.
we
had
a
conditional
judgment
by
the
district
court
sending
it
back:
if
you
do
not
act
in
accordance
with
law
within
30
days,
i
will
enter
judgment
on
this
case.
we
have
that,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
was
not
a
dismissal.
they
overlooked
district
court
docket
57.
there
was
a
judgment
entered
in
ms.
hardt's
favor
against
reliance
in
the
amount
of
attorney's
fees.
the
original
order
merges
into
that
judgment.
we
have
a
final
judgment
here
as
well.
although
we
don't
need
it
under
section
502(g)(1),
we
have
it
here.
this
court
should
not
require
a
judgment
before
fees
can
be
awarded.
the
whole
--
and
it
certainly
shouldn't
adopt
a
purely
procedural
rule
out
of
thin
air
that's
not
in
the
statute.
this
is
a
procedural
statute.
the
only
way
claimants
can
effectuate
their
right
is
ensuring
the
procedure
is
followed.
that
is
what
we
have
here.
they
did
not
follow
proper
procedure.
they
abused
their
discretion.
they
breached
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
the
claimant.
in
these
circumstances,
under
the
clear
language
and
clear
structure
of
this
statute,
this
claimant
is
entitled
to
fees.
the
only
--
may
i
finish?
mr.
john
r.
ates
the
only
issue
that
reliance
contested
was
whether
she
was
a
prevailing
party.
knock
that
leg
of
the
stool,
their
case
fails.
thank
you.
