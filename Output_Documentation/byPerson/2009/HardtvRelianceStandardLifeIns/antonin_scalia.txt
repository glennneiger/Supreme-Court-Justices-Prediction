scalia
it
was
the
same
in
hanrahan.
there
was
a
right
to
a
certain
process
in
the
lower
court,
and
the
--
the
person
complaining
achieved
reversal.
it
was
sent
back
and
said:
do
it
right.
give
this
person
the
process
that
--
that
he's
entitled
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
the
respondent
points
out,
the
position
you're
taking
is
unusual
for
the
government.
the
government
is
usually
arguing
against
fees,
because
the
fees
are
often
assessed
against
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
you
know
that
you're
making
your
bed
and
you're
going
to
have
to
lie
in
it--
[laughter]
--and
you're
essentially
saying
that
when
there
is
simply
a
procedural
victory,
which
happens
all
the
time,
when
--
when
an
agency
is
--
is
reversed
in
its
procedure
even
though
the
--
the
--
the
petitioner
here
doesn't
get
any
concrete
relief
until
it
goes
back
to
the
agency
and
may
lose
in
the
agency
ultimately,
you're
--
you're
content
to
say
that
fees
are
assessable
in
that
situation,
just
by
reason
of
the
procedural
victory.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
talking
about
other
prevailing
--
i'm
talking
about
other
statutes
that
don't
say
"prevailing
party".
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
it's
reasonable
to
interpret
an
attorney's
fee
provision
as
having
anything
to
do
with
trust
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
a
requirement
of
attorney's
fees
enacted
by
--
by
the
federal
congress,
and
i
--
i
find
that
very
artificial.
justice
antonin
scalia
future
claimants
will
not
ask
for
summary
judgment
from
the
district
court,
presumably,
in
light
of
conkright.
they
will
ask
that
the
case
be
remanded.
so,
in
future
cases,
will
they
have
obtained
a
victory?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we've
--
we've
already
told
them
they
can't
get
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
claimant
doesn't
--
doesn't
really
claim
that.
the
claimant
just
says
this
was
a
wrong
decision
and
they
should
do
it
correctly.
and
the
claimant
knows
that
all
he's
going
to
get
from
the
district
court
is
a
remand.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
would
not
ask
for
money
and,
therefore,
would
be
victorious,
on
your
analysis.
if
all
he
asked
for
was
a
remand,
he
got
a
remand.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it's
a
trust
--
trust
law
is
at
issue
here,
is
the
government's
assertion.
