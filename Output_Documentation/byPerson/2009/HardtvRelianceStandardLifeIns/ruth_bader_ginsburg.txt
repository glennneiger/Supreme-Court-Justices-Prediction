are
you
saying
that
in
hanrahan
there
was
no
prod
at
all
from
the
court,
and
here
there
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
hanrahan,
there
was
no
prod
from
the
court;
the
court
didn't
say
anything
that
--
it
was
the
filing
of
the
complaint
that
led
to
the
action,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
now,
in
response
to
"do
it
right",
reliance
on
a
complete
record
and
very
careful
review
finds
that
total
disability
was
not
proved.
then
there
would
be
no
fees,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
footnote
that
was
mentioned
in
ruckelshaus
that
said:
"congress
found
it
necessary
to
explicitly
state
that
the
term
"appropriate"
extended
to
suits
that
forced
defendants
to
abandon
illegal
conduct.
"
--illegal
conduct
was
found
here
--
"although
without
a
formal
court
order?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
not
merely
a
catalyst.
in
buckhannon,
the
catalyst
theory
was
rejected.
here
the
court
said:
if
i
were
to
decide
right
now
--
the
district
court
said:
i
am
inclined
to
rule
for
hardt,
but
i'm
going
to
give
reliance
an
opportunity
to
respond.
so
the
court
had
evaluated
the
evidence
at
that
point
as
favoring
hardt.
to
that
extent,
it
wasn't
a
purely
procedural
ruling.
it
says:
as
things
stand
now,
hardt
should
get
fees;
but
i'm
leaving
the
door
open.
so
it
wasn't
just
a
procedural
decision.
it
was
an
evaluation
of
the
evidence
up
to
that
point,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenkranz,
suppose
the
complaint
was:
i
asked
for
a
turnover
of
certain
documents;
they
refused
without
reason.
and
the
court
says:
you're
right;
you're
entitled
to
those
documents.
it's
interlocutory;
there
is
no
decision;
but
the
only
thing
that
the
plaintiff
asked
for
the
plaintiff
got,
that
is
entitlement
to
the
documents.
the
court
said:
you
are
entitled
to
the
documents.
and
then
it
goes
back,
and
the
documents
are
turned
over
because
the
court
has
ordered
that.
under
your
theory,
because
there
was
no
determination
of
benefits,
even
that
ruling
which
was
a
total
victory
for
the
plaintiff
doesn't
open
the
door
to
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
would
fall
--
even
if
in
the
end
of
the
--
at
the
end
of
the
day
no
--
no
award
is
made?
no
benefits
are
awarded?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
but
you
say
--
you
called
it
purely
procedural
and
you
said
yes,
but
that's
the
only
thing
that
she
asked
for.
so
she
got
it.
so
she
qualifies
for
fees.
even
though
you
just
characterized
it
as
purely
procedural,
it's
a
purely
procedural
ruling,
but
it's
all
she
asked
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
she
gets
benefits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
not
dealing
with
something
obscure.
if
the
--
the
plaintiff
says,
i
have
asked
for
certain
documents,
they
withheld
those
documents
with
no
good
cause
at
all,
and
the
court
said:
you're
right;
turn
over
documents.
it's
that
hypothetical.
it's
just
--
that's
the
situation.
there
is
a
final
order:
turn
over
the
documents.
but
it's
a
procedural
order,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
nonetheless,
benefits
would
be
--
nonetheless,
fees
would
be
available?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
changing
--
you're
changing
the
answer.
the
answer
that
you
first
gave
me
was
it's
a
discrete
issue
--
final
judgment,
yes,
qualifies
for
fees.
now
you're
saying
no,
no
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
claim
were:
they're
just
not
processing
my
application.
so,
court,
order
them
to
process
my
application.
right;
they're
not
doing
anything;
we
order
then
to
go
process
the
application.
end
of
case
in
the
district
court.
fee
entitlement?
