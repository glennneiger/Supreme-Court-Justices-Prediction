justice
stephen
g.
breyer
take
the
case,
though
--
just
take
the
--
what
is
the
government's
position?
the
erisa
plaintiff
wants
$5
million.
they
get
denied
everything.
the
--
the
court
says:
i
noticed
here
there
was
a
30-day
deadline
that
you
had,
and
he
only
gave
you
28
days,
so
i'm
sending
it
back,
but
i'll
tell
you
your
claim
that
there
was
enough
evidence
is
absurd;
you're
never
going
to
win
it.
and
then
he
goes
back,
and
he
loses
it.
okay?
he
has
had
a
procedural
victory.
does
he
get
attorney's
fees?
not
--
not
a
chance
that
he's
going
to
win
this
claim,
and,
indeed,
he
loses
it.
he
doesn't
get
a
penny.
does
he
get
attorney's
fees,
because
on
a
technicality
he
won
a
new
hearing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
the
statute,
in
the
view
of
the
government,
permit
attorney's
fees
in
the
case
i
just
mentioned?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
is,
yes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
does
permit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you're
just
saying
it
won't
be
a
problem
because
the
district
court
judges
are
all
reasonable,
and
i
know
they
think
that.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
judgment
is,
send
it
back.
that's
what
it
says:
send
it
back.
and
the
reason
for
sending
it
back
is
this
woman
was
undergoing
terrible
pain,
that
the
social
security
administration
says
she's
completely
disabled,
that
she's
entitled
in
the
--
on
the
evidence
shown.
there's
no
substantial
evidence
to
the
contrary.
but
you,
the
company,
want
to
take
money
from
her
instead
of
giving
her
the
money.
now,
i've
read
the
record.
it
doesn't
support
anything
contrary
to
what
i've
said.
so
now
you
send
it
back.
now,
what
is
that
but
a
big
victory
for
the
other
side?
which
then
leaves
the
company
to
say:
they're
right;
pay
them.
now,
if
that
isn't
--
i
mean,
what
words
of
english
--
if
you're
--
we're
talking
about
partial
success.
partial
success,
or
not
total
defeat.
that
is
the
language
from
ruckelshaus.
not
"total
success".
you
still
get
it.
okay.
what
in
the
english
language
can
we
read
in
a
case
or
a
statute
that
would
say
you
shouldn't
reach
that
commonsense
result?
now,
of
course,
i'm
characterizing
it
a
little
bit,
but
it
does
seem
like
a
commonsense
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
someone
wants
a
remand,
it's
a
remand,
but
on
limited
grounds;
that
is,
a
holding
of
the
district
court.
the
erisa
administrator
was
--
it's
an
abuse
of
his
discretion
to
refuse
to
give
this
woman
nothing.
in
my
opinion,
she's
entitled
at
least
to
$30,000,
but
whether
it's
30
or
35,
i
don't
know.
so
i
remand
it
to
the
erisa
administrator
so
he
can
decide
to
act
within
--
within
his
discretion,
give
her
either
30,
1,
2,
3,
4,
or
5.
now,
in
your
view,
attorney's
fees
--
all
the
statute
says
is
the
court,
in
its
discretion,
may
allow
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
nothing
more.
now,
what
would
stop
an
attorney's
fee
in
that
situation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
what
you
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
distinguish
between
him
saying
you
have
to
give
her
at
least
30
and
his
saying
the
evidence
that
supports
giving
her
less
than
30
is
--
insufficient,
is
substantially
--
is
--
what's
the
word?
yes,
worthless.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
line
you
draw?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be,
but
why
can't
they
do
this?
what
would
be
wrong
with
this
heretical
idea,
that
as
long
as
the
plaintiff
wins
something
out
of
the
court,
the
district
judge
--
that
group
of
people
we
were
talking
about
--
has
discretion
to
decide
whether
ultimately
they
got
something
significant
of
what
they
wanted,
and
as
long
as
that
judgment
helped
them
get
them
something
significantly
of
what
they
wanted,
attorney's
fees
are
fine;
and
we
leave
it
all
up
to
the
district
judge
as
long
as
the
district
judge
doesn't
abuse
the
discretion
that
that
standard
gives
him?
what
would
--
i
mean,
would
the
earth
come
to
an
end?
what
would
happen
that
would
be
so
terrible
if
we
said
something
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't
say
anything
against
the
catalyst
theory.
it
said
you
have
to
remember
this
is
an
american
country,
we
follow
the
american
rule,
and
there
has
to
be
something
special
in
the
situation.
and
what
would
be
special
in
this
situation
is
that
the
judge
has
to
decide
that
as
a
result
of
the
favorable
ruling,
the
plaintiff
really
did
get
something
significantly
of
what
she
wanted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
also
received
--
she
also
received
a
conditional
judgment
in
her
favor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
she
said:
unless
this
order
goes
into
effect
within
30
days,
the
judgment
will
be
entered
for
the
plaintiff,
for
her
--
for
her.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
she
got
one
judgment
in
her
favor.
it
was
a
conditional
judgment.
i
mean,
if
we're
being
technical,
if
we're
going
to
just
do
this
totally
on
some
kind
of
procedural
theory
of
what's
a
judgment,
what's
a
judgment
in
your
favor,
and
we
just
don't
want
to
look
to
the
merits
of
it
and
see
what
really
happened,
then
why
doesn't
she
win?
because
she
got
a
judgment
in
her
favor,
okay?
end
of
the
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
let's
read
the
judgment.
let's
see.
it
says
--
it
says
judgment.
it
says
in
a
--
what
is
it
called?
i
just
saw
it
here.
my
colleague
had
it
here.
it
says
--
i
think
this
it.
it
says
"conclusion"
--
it
says
--
and
it's
in
the
conclusion,
and
it
says
what
happens.
and
it
says
it
denies,
denies,
denies,
denies.
and
then
it
says:
"reliance
to
act
on
ms.
hardt's
application,
adequately
considering
all
the
evidence,
within
30
days.
"
"otherwise,
judgment
will
be
issued
in
favor
of
mrs.
hardt.
"
now,
that's
in
a
kind
of
judgment,
i
guess.
it's
in
an
order.
so
an
order
saying
we'll
issue
a
judgment
--
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
could
say
that's
a
judgment
in
her
favor.
you
don't
have
to,
but
you
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
normally,
a
judge
--
a
judge
doesn't
say:
it
is
ordered
that
if
you
do
not
act
within
30
days,
there
will
be
a
judgment
entered
in
flavor
of
the
plaintiff.
that's
not
a
usual
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
saying,
if
we're
going
to
be
formal
and
we're
going
to
look
to
certain
words
included
in
--
in
certain
papers,
irrespective
of
what
really
happened,
don't
we
have
those
words
in
the
paper
that's
relevant
here?
