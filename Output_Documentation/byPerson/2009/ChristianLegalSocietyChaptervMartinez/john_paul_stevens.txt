so,
what
if
the
belief--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
the
belief
is
that
african
americans
are
inferior?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
garre?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question?
i'd
like
you
to
answer,
and
i'd
like
your
opponent,
too:
do
you
think
that,
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
we
have
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
an
all-comers
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
we
must
do
that
to
decide
the
case?
and
i
want
to
ask
your
opponent
the
same
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they're
all--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
may
be
a
lot
of
other
things
we
can
decide,
but
in
all
events,
we
must
decide
that
much?
justice
john
paul
stevens
put
--
put
to
a
side
a
moment
--
forget
the
as-applied.
just
take
a
--
a
pure
all-comers
policy.
must
we
decide
the
constitutionality
of
that?
