mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
was
decided
by
both
courts
below
on
the
premise,
which
is
not
disputed
at
any
point
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that
hastings
reserves
the
funding
and
benefits
that
go
to
student
groups
that
obtain
school
recognition
to
groups
that
choose
to
admit
all
students--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--regardless
of
their
status
or
their
beliefs.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all,
this
is
a
case
about
injunctive
relief.
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
only
policy
that's
relevant
is
the
current
policy,
and
that's
the
one--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
both
sides
agree
is
in
place.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
it's
--
it's
the
way
in
which
hastings
implements
the
nondiscrimination
policy
in
this
particular
forum.
and,
again,
look
at
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case.
it's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
it
--
justice
scalia,
this
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
is
operative.
this
--
the
all-comers
policy
is
how
it's
implemented
in
this
context.
and
the
written
policy
applies
not
only
to
the
enumerated
characteristics;
it
applies
to
any
arbitrary
unreasonable
discrimination,
and
the
law
school--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
does,
your
honor.
it
says
in
the
first
paragraph
on
--
this
is
on
page
220--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of
the
joint
appendix:
the
college
is
committed
to
a
policy
against
legally
impermissible,
arbitrary,
or
unreasonable
discriminatory
practices.
and
then
it
also
goes
on
and
enumerates
specific
factors.
and
this
is
spelled
out,
i
believe
in
page--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it
provides
additional
guidance.
but
--
but,
again,
there
shouldn't
be
any
debate
about
what
policy
is
at
issue
here.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
is
two-sentence
long.
the
first
sentence
describes
the
policy
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
it
says:
"the
parties
stipulate"--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
alito,
it
was
decided
in
the
wake
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
truth,
which
had
not
only
garnered
a
substantial
panel
decision
but
had
garnered
serious
consideration
on
--
on
rehearing.
so
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
properly
concluded,
was
controlled
by
the
truth
decision.
so
in
that
respect--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
the
--
in
the
sense
that
it
was
backed
up
by
the
truth
decision,
yes.
but
look
at
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
nowhere
did
--
did
petitioners
challenge
the
ninth
circuit's
characterization
of
the
policy
at
issue.
the
petition
says
on
page
2
that
"there
are
no
disputed
issues
of
material
fact.
"
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
if
--
if
they
believe
that
that
caused
the
school
to
adopt
a
different
policy,
they
shouldn't
have
stipulated
to
the
policy
that
they
did.
and
they
should
have
challenged
at
a
minimum--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--all
of
the
bylaws
that
they've
pointed
to,
justice
scalia--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
they
have
pointed
to
in
their
brief--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
scalia,
either,
number
one,
explicitly
say
that
the
organization
will
comply
with
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
school
or
say
that
they
will
admit
all
students.
that
includes
all
the
bylaws.
now,
they
have
pointed
to
various
things
from
the
bylaws,
and
this
evolved
as
they've
tried
to
create
material
factual
issues
in
this
court.
one
of
the
things
they've
pointed
to
is
the
bylaws
saying,
like
the
outlaw
bylaw,
that
says
that
students
who
are
members
of
a
group
can
be
excelled
if
they
--
expelled
if
they
engage
in
disruptive
or
gross
misconduct.
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
about
that
with
the
school's
policy.
the
school's
interest
is
not
in
allowing
students
to
disrupt
the
activities
of
students'
groups--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
group
that
says
people
of
a
particular
sexual
orientation
are
not
allowed
to
become
members--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
scalia,
the
district
court
made
a
--
may
i?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
okay.
my
apologies.
[laughter]
mr.
chief
justice,
as
--
as
dean
--
as
director
of
student
services
testified,
the
fact
that
the
bylaws
may
say
we
want
students
who
are
interested
in
our
activities
doesn't
mean
that
the
bylaws
are
excluding
students
who
want
to
join.
and
there's
a
fundamental
difference,
again,
between
saying
students
that
have
these
particular
beliefs
or
status
cannot
become
members
of
our
group--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
my
friend's
position
that
is
evolving.
you
have
joint
stipulations
before
you
as
to
what
the
policy
is.
you
have
the
decisions
of
both
courts
below
describing
that
policy
consistently
with
the
joint
stipulations,
and
you
have
a
petition
for
certiorari
that
never
challenges
that
the
all-comers
policy
is
at
issue.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
this
case
wasn't--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
sotomayor,
this
case
wasn't
litigated
as
a
pretext
case.
if
you
look
at
the
briefs
in
this
case,
the
first
time
that
the
word
"pretext"
is
used
is
in
the
reply
brief
in
this
court.
it
was
litigated
as
a
challenge,
which
is
a
serious
challenge,
to
the
constitutionality
of
an
all-comers
policy
in
this
particular
forum.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
absolutely
is,
justice
scalia,
and
it's
explained--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
explained
in
the
amicus
brief
for
the
american
council
of
education,
explained
in
the
state
universities
amicus
brief.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
kennedy--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--hastings--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--a
few
--
a
number
of
things,
justice
kennedy.
the
first
is
the
line-drawing
issue
that
has
been
made
clear
during
the
first
part
of
the
argument
this
morning.
if
you're
going
--
they
appear
to
take
off
the
table
race
and
what
they
say
are
other
status
considerations.
i'm
not
sure
why
that
excludes
sexual
orientation.
but
if
you're
going
to
allow
religious
groups,
or
any
group,
to
draw
exceptions
for
some
people,
then
you
have
to
determine
where
to
draw
the
line.
and
i
think
a
school
can
reasonably
say:
we
don't
want
to
get
into
this
business
at
all;
we
want
to
allow
all
comers--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--for
all
school-subsidized
groups.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
doesn't
go
to
status
or
belief.
if
you're
talking
about
attendance
requirements
or
competition--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--those
are
merits-based
requirements.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
la
raza
bylaws
--
first
of
all,
they
did
explicitly
say
that
groups
could
not
exclude
members
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation.
now,
they
--
there
was
some
confusion
about
how
la
raza
had
interpreted
their
bylaws.
the
school
went
back
to
la
raza
and
said:
are
you
excluding
members?
la
raza
said:
no,
we're
not;
we're
open
to
all.
and
to
eliminate
any
doubt,
they
amended
their
bylaws.
that's
the
one
example
they've
come
up
in
the
20-year
history
of
this
policy.
and
what
does
it
show?
if
you
want
to
look
at--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
scalia,
it's
based
on
the
sworn
deposition
testimony
on
the
former
dean,
who
had
been
at
the
school
since
1993,
the
director
of
student
services,
who
had
been
there
at
least
since
1999,
as
this
is
how
they
had
implemented
the
nondiscrimination
policy.
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
this
court
to
overturn
that
sworn
testimony.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
you--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
the
court
believes
that,
respectfully,
we
think
it
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted.
this
case
was
litigated
based
on
stipulations
to
avoid
precisely
these
factual
issues
that
we're
now
talking
about
for
the
first
time
before
this
court.
now,
i
think
it
is
common
ground
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
true.
georgetown
law
school
does.
columbia
law
school.
look,
there's
an
amicus
brief
filed
by
13
educational
organizations
representing
thousands
of
colleges
and
universities
across
the
country,
including
the
association
of
jesuit
colleges
and
universities,
saying
that
this
is
a
not-uncommon
and
a
reasonable
policy.
we're
not
saying
it's
the
only
approach
that
colleges
can
take
in
balancing
the
competing
interests
here.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we're
saying
it's
a
constitutional--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
alito,
that's
the
claim,
obviously,
that
the
other
side
is
making.
and,
with
respect,
this
example
has
never
happened
at
hastings
in
20
years.
it
has
really
never
happened
in
the
history
of
american
education.
if
you
look
at
cases
like
the
voter
i.d.
case,
the
partial-birth
abortion
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
this
court
would
ordinarily
take
into
account
the
likelihood
that
something
would
happen,
and
if
you're
dealing
where
the
only
experience--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of
course
this
court
is
going
to
examine
the
chill,
but
so
--
just
like
in
the
voter
i.d.
case,
where
you
had
had
people
saying
this
was
going
to
and,
on
secondhand
accounts,
did
exclude
people
from
getting
to
the
--
ballot
access.
this
court
said,
look,
that
might
happen,
but
it's
not
a
basis
to
invalidate
this
law
across
the
board.
come
back
with
an
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
there's
--
as
to
the
takeover
hypothetical,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
has
happened.
groups
can
take
measures
to
prevent
it.
they
can
require
attendance
requirements
before
people
become
members.
they
can
instruct
into
their
bylaws--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--people
have
to
be
--
attend
a
certain
number
of
meetings
before
they
can
join.
they
can
have--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
can
have
in
their
--
they
can
--
sure.
i
mean,
we
can
entertain
the
hypotheticals.
but
they
can
have
in
their
bylaws
a
provision
just
like
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
that
amendments
can
only
be
made
by
a
super-majority--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
if
that
started
to
take
place,
the
college
would
reconsider
its
policy.
it
could
bring
a
first
amendment
challenge
saying
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
would--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
at
that
point--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
obviously
the
members
would
rejoin
and
form
another
group,
your
honor.
i
mean,
we're
not
dealing
with
this
in
a
factual
vacuum.
cls's
predecessor
existed
at
the
schools
for
10
years
and
in--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
that
happened
your
honor.
i
mean,
this
has
never
happened
ever
in
--
in
the
history
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--education.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely.
and
cls,
like
any
group,
can
have
a
rule
that
disruptive
members
should
be
expelled.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor,
the
record
does
show
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
record
does
show,
your
honor,
that
there
was
a
gay
student
who
was
a
member
of
the
group.
and
that's
--
let
me
give
you
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
was
the
predecessor
group.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
actually--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
the
record
shows
is
that
she
participated
in
discussions
that
the
officer
of
the
group
said
it
was
a
joy
to
have
her
and
that
both
sides
learned.
i
think
cls's
position
depends
on
the
dark
notion
that
students
would
not
have
any
interest
in
joining
a
group
with
different
viewpoints
on
certain
issues
except
to
disrupt
that
group.
and
i
think
that
greatly
undersells
the
intellectual
curiosity
of
students.
it
greatly
undersells
the
fact
that
groups
have
many
different
interests
and
perspectives.
the
church
has
a
stance
in
homosexuality,
but
it
has
stances
on
many
other
issues,
too.
and
if
a
student
--
even
if
he
or
she
disagrees
with
the
stance
on
homosexuality,
they
may
agree
with
many
other
aspects
of
the
groups,
and
they
may
want
to
join
in
the
fellowship
of
that
group,
they
want
to
take
advantage
of
intangible
benefits
like
not--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
fact,
the
record
in
the
--
case
shows
that
only
officers
teach
bible
classes,
and
groups
are
perfectly
free
to
structure
their
organization
like
that.
they
can
have
requirements
that
people
attend
certain
meetings
before
they
do
that.
cls
isn't
forced
to
have
anyone
lead
bible
classes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
cls--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
it
was
excluding
students
from
that
group
on
the
basis
of
their
beliefs
or
their
status,
then,
yes,
it
would.
hastings
isn't
in
the
business
of
second-guessing
the
--
the
beliefs
of
--
of
individual
groups,
and
the
whole
point
of
the
policy
really
is
to
stay
out
of
this,
to
just
have
a
blanket
rule
that's
equally
neutral.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
think
even
my
friend
recognizes
that
a
group
could
not
exclude
an
individual
on
the
basis
of
their
gender
or
their
beliefs
--
on
the
basis
of
their
gender
or
race.
and
remember
the
bob
jones
case,
this
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but
not
at
all
costs,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
bob
jones
case,
the
claim
was
from
a
--
a
small
private
religious
school
that
has
a
sincere
religious
belief
that
people
who
believed
in
interracial
dating
should
not
become
members
of
their
school.
and
this
court,
nevertheless,
held
that
that
belief,
sincere
as
it
was,
did
not
trump
a
statute
that
denied
education
--
denied
federal
financial
assistance
on
a
viewpoint-neutral
basis
to
schools
that
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
religion.
here
we
have
a
--
a
group
that
wants
to
exclude
members
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation.
we
can
--
cls
has
tried
to
change
that
part--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
--
there
is
a
binding
judicial
admission.
and,
again,
this
gets
back
to
the
bob
jones
example.
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--look
at
page
--
j.a.
page
460,
which
is
where
the
district
court
said
that
cls
made
a
binding
judicial
admission
that
they
wanted
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation.
keep
in
mind
that
this
case
began
because
cls
came
back
to
the
law
school
and
said
we're
happy
to
say
we
won't
discriminate
on
some
grounds,
but
we're
not
going
to
say
we
won't
exclude
students
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
different
case.
it--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
--
i
think
if
the
school
is
regulating
outside
of
the
purposes
of
a
limited
forum,
public
forum
for
recognized
groups,
then
i
doubt
it
could
go
in--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
tell
the
groups--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--where
--
where--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--where
the
rule
operates
on
a
viewpoint-neutral
basis.
here
what
the
--
the
school
is
doing
is
it
is
publicly
subsidizing--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
can
exist
separately.
at
the
school
we
have
are
numerous--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
fact,
your
honor,
it's
not
--
it's
not--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--unusual
for
schools
to
have
all
male
or
all
women
clubs.
they
are
not
recognized
parts
of
the
community.
these
--
these
are
activities
that
are
subsidized
by
the
students
themselves
through
the
mandatory
student
activities
fees.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
that's
a
much
different
example
than
this
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
hypothetical.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
a
much
different--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
reason
why
the
school
has
a
policy
that
all
groups
that
it
subsidizes
must
admit
all-comers
is
that,
number
one,
it
ensures
that
all
students
enjoy
equal
access
to
all
school-subsidized
and
school-recognized
activities.
number
two,
it
avoids
the
line-drawing
problems
that
we've
discussed
early
this
morning
and
i
think
are
necessarily
going
to
arise
and
also
create
strife
in
small
educational
communities.
number
three,
it
allows--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
with
the
all-comers
rule.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
think
it
--
that
happens
at
all,
justice
scalia.
i
think
when
you've
the
policy
that
all
students
have
to
become
members,
regardless
of
their
status
or
belief,
that
gets
the
school
out
of
the
business
of
determining
whether,
number
one,
people
are
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
an
essential
belief,
which
is,
is
the
way
that
petitioner
describes
his
--
their
rule.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
competitive-based,
merit-based
requirements
are
not
excluded.
it
--
they're
not--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
and
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
it
were
truly
an
objective
knowledge
test,
it
would
be
okay.
it
would
be
no
different
than
the
law
review.
these
are
merits-based
determinations.
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
excluding
people
on
the
basis
of
merit
and
excluding
people
on
the
basis
of
status
or
belief
that
has
no
connection
to
merit.
that
--
that,
i
think,
is
a
long-standing
understanding
of
discrimination.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
it
goes
to
the
nature
of
whether
it's
discrimination
under
the
school's
policy,
and
i
think
status
or
belief.
people
understand
--
that's
why
we
are
talking
about
things
like
race
or
gender
or
sexual
orientation,
disability,
military
status,
any
number
of
these
things.
and
i
think
the
school's
policy
avoids
having
to
draw
lines
as
to
whether
or
not
a
group
has
a
sufficient
enough
belief
that
military
members
should
become
a
member
of
the
amnesty
international
club
because
they
disagree
with
the
war,
that
disabled
members
should
be
--
disabled
students
should
be
a
member
of
a
particular
group.
and
the
school's
policy
avoids
these
line-drawing--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
that's
the
policy
before
this
court.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
believe
you
have
to
do
that,
because
that
is
the
policy--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--before
this
court.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely.
if
i
could
just
discuss
briefly
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
it's
pretextual
in
the
church
of
lukumi
babalu
aye
sense,
yes.
no
--
no
school
can
purposely
discriminate
at
a
group,
no
matter
what
policy
it
adopts.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
think
so,
justice
--
justice
kennedy,
because
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
and
i
get
back
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
on
page
2
of
the
petition,
the
petition--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
--
yes.
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
case
here.
but
if
a
policy
is
applied
evenhandedly
--
unevenhandedly,
in
a
viewpoint-neutral
way
and
it
burdens
religious
groups,
then
there's
common
ground
that
that
policy
violates
the
constitution.
of
course,
we
think
the
policy
here
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
that
that
would
create
a
factual
issue
and
that
that
issue
might
well
be
tried,
justice
alito.
and
the
one
thing
that
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
this
is
a
request
for
injunctive
relief
and
not
damages.
so
the
only
policy
that
matters
--
and
wilkinson
v.
austin
makes
this
clear
--
is
the
current
policy;
all
parties
agree
that
the
current
policy
is
the
all-comers
policy.
that's
the
policy
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
understood
my
friend's
opening
brief
to
acknowledge
at
the
least
that
that's
the
policy
the
school
has
said
it
has
today.
it
is
the
school's
policy.
it's
supported
by
substantial
history
and
sworn
deposition
testimony.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
does.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
does.
and
that
is
an
additional
basis
for
the
school's
policy.
look
at
california
education
code
66270.
it
explicitly
prohibits
discrimination
in
--
in
programs
and
educational
activities
by
public
schools
like
hastings.
hastings
has
an
obligation
under
state
law
to
prohibit
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation.
the
reason
why
we're
here
today
is
because
cls
insisted
on
the
right
to
discriminate,
to
exclude
students
on
the
basis
of
their
sexual
orientation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
our
position
is
that
the
registered
student
organization
program
is
a
program
of
the
university;
it's
subsidized
by
the
university;
it's
recognized
by
the
university;
and
that
all
students
should
be
able
to
enjoy
access
to
that
program.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
provision
that
we've
cited
to,
66270,
does
not
carve
out
an
exemption
in
this
program
for
a
religious
student
organization.
on
its
face--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
on
its
face,
it
excludes
--
it
has
an
exemption
for
religious
schools;
it
does
not
include
an
exemption
for
religious
organizations
within
the
context
of
this
program.
and
we
think
that
the
program
is
reasonable.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you
very
much.
