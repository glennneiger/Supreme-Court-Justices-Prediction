mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
hastings
is
correct,
a
student
who
does
not
even
believe
in
the
bible
is
entitled
to
demand
to
lead
a
christian
bible
study,
and
if
cls
does
not
promise
to
allow
this,
the
college
will
bar
them
from
its
forum
for
speech.
the
first
amendment
--
under
the
first
amendment,
rights
run
the
opposite
way.
hastings
is
the
government;
cls
is
private.
a
public
forum
for
speech
must
be
open
and
inclusive,
but
participants
in
the
forum
are
entitled
to
their
own
voice.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
happy
to,
justice
kennedy.
if
you
just
look
with
me
at
joint
stipulation
17,
i
think
it
makes
this
completely
clear.
that's
on
page
221
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
states:
"both
parties
agreed
that
in
order
to
become
a
registered
student
organization
a
student
organization's
bylaws
must
provide
that
its
membership
is
open
to
all
students.
"
--that's
the
all-comers
policy
--
"and
the
organization
must
agree
to
abide
by.
"
--"abide
by
the
nondiscrimination
policy".
that's
capital
n,
capital
p,
a
defined
term.
the
15.
that
is
what
we
have
been
calling
the
written
policy.
and
the
idea
that
membership
must
be
open
to
all
students
is
described
in
joint
stipulation
18,
which
is
simply
a
description
of
what
that
policy
is.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
is
broader.
it's
our
position
that
either
of
these
justifications
for
excluding
cls
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
justice
scalia,
our
argument
--
there
are
two
policies.
they
have
invoked
both.
we
believe
both
are
unconstitutional,
but
for
slightly
different
reasons.
the
written
policy
is
unconstitutional
because
it's
overtly
viewpoint
discrimination
--
discriminatory
and
thus
violating
the
principles
of
cases
like
rosenberger
and
widmar.
the
all-comers--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
both
policies
we
contend
are
unconstitutional.
let's
begin
with
the
all-comers
policy,
and
when
you
conclude
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
we
will
also
need
to
deal
with
the
other
since
they
have
two
arrows
in
their
quiver.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
it's
a
case
where
the
--
where
hastings
has
put
forward
two
quite
different
justifications
for
denying
our
right
and
both
of
them
are
unconstitutional.
let's
begin
with
the
all-comers
policy.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
entirely
correct,
justice
--
justice
alito.
that's--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--justice--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
but
that
is
in
fact
the
evidence.
when--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--justice
ginsburg,
we
--
we
stipulated
that
this
was
their
policy.
that
stipulation
contains
nothing
about
the
historical
facts
as
to
how
hastings
has
actually
applied
it.
but
let's
talk
about
the
policy,
because
it
is
unconstitutional--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--yes.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
because
the
policy
is
i
think
blatantly
unconstitutional.
it
is
manifestly
overbroad
with
respect
to
any
purposes
stated.
and,
of
course,
in
healy
v.
james,
this
court
held
that
any
restriction
on
a
student
speech
forum
may
be
no
more
extensive
than
is
required
by
its
purposes.
it
is
also
a
frontal
assault
on
freedom
of
association.
freedom
of
association
is
the
right
to
form
around
shared
beliefs.
to
say
that
groups
may
not
form
around
shared
beliefs--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--not
at
all,
justice
sotomayor.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
stipulation
is
that
they
may
not
exclude
based
on
status
or
beliefs.
we
have
only
challenged
the
beliefs,
not
status.
race,
any
other
status
basis
hastings
is
able
to
enforce.
but
they
may
not
tell
a
group--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that
you
just
have
to
let
you
in
that
don't
agree
with
you.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
again,
i
think
they
can
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
the
belief,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
the
status.
so
that
if
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--if
there
were
racist
organizations--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
right,
but
they
could
not
go
the
next
step
and
exclude
someone
on
the
basis
of
status,
under
our--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--it's
that
the
group
may
not
confine
its
leadership
based
upon
its
beliefs.
that
means
that--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--right.
and
--
and
our
view
is
that
the
status--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
status
half
of
that
is
perfectly
constitutional
and--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
belief
half
of
that
is
not.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
what
is
--
what
is
wrong
with
that
is
that
restrictions
on
a
designated
public
forum
must
be
reasonable
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
forum.
the
purpose
of
the
forum
is
set
forth
in
joint
stipulation
number
8.
it
is
to
promote
a
diversity
of
viewpoints
among
registered
student
organizations.
if
the
student
organizations
are
not
allowed
to
have
a
coherent
set
of
beliefs,
there
can
be
no
diversity
among
them.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
there
is
a
stipulation
as
to
what
the
purpose
is,
and
the
purpose
is
to
promote
a
diversity
of
viewpoints
among
registered
student
organizations.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
is
a
stipulated
fact.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
which
is
not
the
joint
stipulation.
the
stipulation
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
forum
is
diversity
among
groups.
their
policy
is
not
--
it's
not
only
just
unreasonable
in
light
of
it;
it
is
contrary
to
it.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
forum.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
they
say
that
in
their
brief,
but
that
is
not
the
stipulated
fact
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it's
page
216
in
the
joint
appendix,
joint
stipulation
number
8.
it
is
the
only
stipulation
in
the
case
having
to
do
with
what
the
purpose
is
of
the
rso
forum.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
"hastings
seeks
to
promote
a
diversity
of
viewpoints
among
registered
student
organizations.
"
and
note
how
destructive
an
all-comers
policy
directed
on
belief
is
toward
--
toward
that.
that
means
that
if,
for
example,
there's
an
naacp
chapter,
it
would
have
to
allow
a
--
a
racist
skinhead
to
sit
on
--
in
on
its
planning
meetings.
that
means
that
if
there's
an
environmentalist
club
that
has
a
demonstration
in
sacramento
in
favor
of
cap-and-trade
legislation,
they
would
have
to
allow--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--a
global
warming
skeptic
to--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--they
haven't
happened
because
this
policy
came
into
being
--
was
announced
for
the
first
time
in
2005.
so
there
couldn't
possibly
be
any
--
any
record
of
that.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct,
it
was
not.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
joint
stipulation
number
40
states
clearly
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
they
were
informed,
and
i
quote:
"they
were
informed
that
cls
bylaws
were
not
compliant
with
the
religion
and
sexual
orientation
provisions
of
the
nondiscrimination
policy.
"
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
never.
and--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i
don't
think
so.
every
time
the
policy
is
mentioned,
it
seems
to
morph
into
something
else.
when
the
dean
announced
it
at
the
deposition,
she
said
all
students
may
participate
on
the
--
in
all
activities,
period,
full
stop.
now
we
find
out
in
their
brief,
well,
their
--
groups
can
have
conduct
limitations,
they
can
require
dues,
they
can
have
attendance
requirements,
they
can
have
competitive
contests
to
see
whether
they
get
in.
this
--
this
policy
is
--
it
changes
with
every
wind.
and
--
but
the
fundamental
problem
with
this
--
with
this
is
what
--
what
this
court
stated
in
velazquez
v.
legal
services
corporation,
that
you
cannot
allow
--
you
cannot
allow
the
terms
of
the
policy
just
to
say
that
whatever
their
policy
is,
that
that
determines
the
contours
of
the
program,
because
that
would
render
the
first
amendment
a
--
a
nullity.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
separation
is
between
church
and
state,
but
this
court
has
held
over
and
over
again
that
speech
forums
--
that
people
participating
in
a
speech
forum
are
not
the
state.
the
state
is
hastings.
we
are
perfectly
private.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
a
religious
organization,
even
on
public--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--we
would.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
now,
we
do
--
there
is
in
addition
a
free
exercise
argument,
but
i
don't
--
but
in
this
case
what
the
free
exercise
clause
protects
is
exactly
what
the
associational
freedom
test
would
protect
for
everyone.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
again,
separation
does
not
apply
to
private
parties
when
they
are
operating,
even
on
government
property.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
no,
justice
ginsburg.
our
position
is
it
is
unconstitutional
to
--
to
prohibit
groups
to
form
around
beliefs
but
not
around
status.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
they
can
insist
that
--
that
everyone
who
participates
in
the
group
have
that
belief,
and
that,
as
justice
scalia
said,
may
mean
it's
going
to
be
a
very
small
group.
but
they
cannot
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
status.
but
belief
--
as
this
court
said
in
cantwell
v.
connecticut,
belief,
the
freedom
to
believe,
is
absolute.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
it's
not
unusual
to
say
people
--
people
can
believe
in
all
kinds
of
things
that
are
illegal.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
can
do
them.
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
an
unfamiliar
distinction
in
our
law.
but
let's
look
at--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
written
policy?
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes.
there's
a
joint
stipulation
to
that
effect,
number
34.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
--
it
does.
i
thought
that
justice
breyer
posited
the
case
of
a
person
of
homosexual
orientation
who
shares
that
belief.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
oh,
oh,
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
this
is
a
religious
group.
their
understanding
of
marriage
is
based
upon
their--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--not
if
that
person
was
engaging
in
sexual
conduct
that
is
contrary
to
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
in
that--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--or
--
i'm
sorry.
or--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--right.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right.
if
the
person--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--regardless
of
what
he
intends
to
do,
if
he
does
not
agree
with
the
--
the
organization
on
the
point
of
--
of
marriage,
then
he
can
be
--
he
can
be
excluded
from
leadership
in
the
group.
again,
he's
able
to
attend
all
the
activities.
cls
has
all
of
its
activities
entirely
open
to
everyone.
and
what
it
objects
to
is
having
--
is
being
run
by
non-christians,
because
after
all,
this
is
a
group
whose
very
purpose
is--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--what
i
--
justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
what
we
consistently
say
is
that
we
have
been
denied
the
right
to
meet
on
campus.
and
that
is
completely
true.
look
--
if
you
would
look
at
joint
stipulation
number
10,
at
the
top
of
page
219,
it
provides
that
cls,
although
not
currently
registered,
is
eligible
to
apply
for
permission
for
rooms.
but
there
is
no
stipulation
that
that
will
ever
be
granted,
and
the
record
shows
that
every
time
cls
has
requested
permission
to
meet
they
have
gotten
a
complete
run-around.
they
have
been
told:
well,
you
have
to
apply
through
your
lawyer,
and
then
their
--
they
don't
get
an
answer
on
time
and
when
they
get
an
answer
it's,
well,
because
you're
not
a
registered
student
group--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--there
is
not
room
for
you.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
justice
sotomayor,
even
the
access
to
campus
communications
is
absolutely
essential,
as
this
court
said
in
the
--
in
healy
v.
james.
we
are
barred
from
access
to
the
--
to
hastings'
e-mail
system;
we
can't
post
notices
on
the
usual
bulletin
board;
we
are
left
out
of
the
weekly--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--there
--
there's
--
there
are
ones
for
the
--
for
campus
and
student
groups,
and
there's
another
one
for
community
groups.
we're
allowed
to
post
on
the
community
group,
but
we're
not
allowed
to
post
on
the
boards
that
--
that
students
look
to
for
where
student
activities
occur.
we
are
left
out
of
the
--
a
very
important
point
--
the
student
organization
fair
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
where
groups
introduce
themselves
to
the
one
l's
as
they
--
as
they
come
in.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
we're
--
we're
barred
from
that.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
no,
it's
definitely
a
limited
designated
public
forum.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
only
cite
cantwell
for
the
proposition
that
belief
is
absolute.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
would
address
it.
the
forum
--
the
purposes
of
the
forum
are
undisputed.
they
are
to
provide
a
diversity
of
expression
among
student
groups.
their
policy
disserves
the
purpose
of
the
forum
and
therefore
cannot
be
regarded
as
reasonable
in
light
of
that.
and
what
is
more,
what
they
have
done
is
--
it's
also
not
reasonable
because
it's
independently
unconstitutional.
what
they
have
done
is
they've
said
you
may
not
have
fundamental
freedom
of
association
or,
if
you
do,
we
will
withdraw
an
otherwise
available
benefit
from
you.
as
recently
as
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
fair
v.
rumsfeld,
the
court
reiterated
the
--
the
now
i
think
100-year
old
principle
that
constitutional
rights
may
not
be
penalized
by
the
withdrawal
of
benefits
any
more
than
they
can
by
--
by
direct
prohibition.
i
see
that
my
white
light
is
up,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
we
do
believe
that
the
court
needs
to
reach
the
constitutionality
of
the
all-comers
policy
as
applied
to
cls
in
this
case.
we
brought
only
an
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
not
facially,
but
as
applied
to
cls,
yes.
several
other
points,
i
know--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
correct
as
stipulated
to,
undisputed.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
--
that's
because
we
--
the
complaint
is
accepting
the
--
hastings'
definition
of
sexual
orientation.
we
were
told
that
our
conduct
rule,
our
nonmarital
conduct
rule,
violated
their
sexual
orientation
provision,
and
therefore
we
sought
relief
from
their
sexual
orientation
provision.
it
was
nothing
more
than
that.
there
--
it
is
--
it
is
stipulated
in
joint
stipulation
40,
i
believe
it
is,
that
--
that
cls's
rule
is
based
on
conduct--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--not
orientation.
several
other
points:
my
friend
twice
in
his
presentation
stated
that
the
all-comers
policy
is
simply
their
way
of
implementing
the
nondiscrimination
policy.
but
if
so,
it
is
so
absurdly
overbroad
as
to
be
unconstitutional.
there
is
no
reason
to
stop
the
environmentalist
club
from
leading
--
from
requiring
its
leaders
to
share
environmentalist
views--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--in
order
to--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
tell,
there
is
no
public
university
law
school
in
the
country
that
has
such
a
policy.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
there
are
some
private
universities
that,
according
to
the
aals,
have
such
a
policy.
we
know
nothing
about
them.
they
are
not
in
the
record,
and,
frankly,
i'd
be
a
little
bit
surprised,
because
the
policy
is
so
absurd.
think
of
how
it
would
apply
to
the
law
school
itself,
and
this
policy
does
apply
to
the
law
school
itself.
does
hastings
really
mean
to
say
it
is
committing
itself
to
an
all-comers
policy
when
it
hires
faculty
or
admits
students?
do
they
not
care
about
the
belief
of
its
dean
of
admissions,
about
beliefs
of
--
about,
say,
affirmative
action?
the
very
idea
of
it
is
preposterous.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it's
possible,
but--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--yes,
but
hastings
has--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--but
hastings
has--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--hastings
has
a
perfectly
conventional
rso
program
just
like
the
ones
in
healy,
and
widmar
and
rosenberger.
they
just
have
a
policy
that
is
destructive
of
that--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--of
that
program.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
what
can--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--what
you
can
say
is
that
healy
v.
james
requires
a
substantial
justification
for
exclusion
of
a
student
group
from
a
registered
student
activity
forum,
and
this
is
not
a
substantial
justification;
it
is
a
silly
justification.
if
it
is
silly,
crazy,
and
preposterous,
it
is
not
even
reasonable,
let
alone
compelling
or
substantial.
