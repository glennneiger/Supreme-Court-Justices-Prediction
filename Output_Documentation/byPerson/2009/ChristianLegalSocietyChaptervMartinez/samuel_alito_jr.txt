justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
mcconnell,
when
i
read
--
when
i
read
the
papers
that
hastings
submitted
to
the
district
court
at
the
same
time
that
the
joint
stipulation
was
submitted,
i
saw
one
reference
after
another
to
an
allegation
that
hastings
was
applying
its
policy
in
a
discriminatory
manner,
that
it
was
not
in
fact
insisting
that
all
registered
student
organizations
admit
all
applicants.
and
when
i
read
their
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit,
i
saw
that
point
reiterated
again
and
again.
so
that
led
me
to
believe
that
what
was
stipulated
was
not
that
in
fact
they
had
a
policy
which
they
enforced
under
which
anybody
who
applied
to
any
group
would
be
admitted,
but
that
this
was
what
dean
kane
had
announced.
that
was
the
stated
policy,
but
not
necessarily
the
actual
policy
that
was
employed.
and
that
was
the
argument
it
seemed
to
me
that
cls
was
making;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
was
there
any
written
document
memorializing
this
policy
prior
to
the
time
when
the
former
dean
gave
her
deposition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
is
the
--
is
the
policy
as
articulated
by
the
dean
in
her
deposition
the
same
as
the
policy
that
hastings
now
claims
it
has
in
its
brief?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
this
case
deserved
a
two-sentence
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
answer
is
yes,
this
case
which
is
--
before
us
has
produced
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
pages
of
amicus
briefs,
deserved
two
sentences
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
hasn't
it
been
--
hasn't
it
been
cls's
position
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
case
that
hastings
has
not
in
fact
required
every
group
to
admit
any
student
who
applies?
don't
they
say
that
over
and
over
again
in
their
district
court
papers,
in
the
court
of
appeals
briefs,
and
in
the
cert
petition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
now
say--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
now
say
in
your
brief
that
it
is
okay
for
a
group
to
impose
membership
requirements
that
are
neutral
and
not
based
on
beliefs.
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
explore--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--let's
explore
the
implications
of
this
policy.
suppose
at
a
particular
campus
there
is
a
great
deal
of
anti-muslim
animus.
and
there's
a
small
muslim
group;
it
has
10
students.
if
the
group
is
required
to
accept
anybody
who
applies
for
membership,
and
50
students
who
hate
muslims
show
up
and
they
want
to
take
over
that
group,
you
say
the
first
amendment
allows
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
cls
obviously
thinks
this
is
a
real
threat.
now,
what
do
you
propose
that
they
do?
suppose
that
you
win
this
case,
and
then
when
the
case
--
and
then
when
this
all-applicants
policy
is
administered,
then
precisely
what
they
fear
begins
to
take
place.
do
they
have
any
recourse?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
do
they
have
any--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--do
they
have
any
recourse?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
they
have
10
members,
and
8
who
are
completely
hostile
to
the
organization
sign
up?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
the
answer
to
that
question.
so,
if
--
if
hostile
members
take
over
cls,
the
former
members
of
cls
can
form
cls
ii?
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
an
orthodox--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
an
orthodox
jewish
group
or
a
muslim
group
applied
for
recognition
and
the
group
said
part
of
our
beliefs
is
--
one
of
our
beliefs
is
that
men
and
women
should
sit
separately
at
religious
services,
would
hastings
deny
registration
to
that
group?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
have
--
we
have
two
amicus
briefs
from
orthodox
jewish
groups
and
a
brief
from
a
muslim
group.
so,
your
answer
is
that
they
could
not
be
recognized
under
hastings'
policy
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
regarding
the
way
religious
services
should
be
conducted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
as
i
understood
the
position,
your
latest
position
in
your
brief,
you
really
don't
say
you
have
an
all-comers
policy.
there
are
certain
criteria
that
can
be
applied,
like
interest,
knowledge;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
a
--
well,
could
a
group,
consistent
with
your
revised
all-comers
policy,
require
that
members
who
want
--
anyone
who
wants
to
become
a
member
show
a
particular
level
of
knowledge
about
the
subject
of
the
group?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
cls
required
anybody
who
wanted
to
become
a
member
to
pass
a
test
on
the
bible,
that
would
be
okay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
school
adopt
an
all-comers
policy--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--for
the
purpose--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
could
i
just
ask
one
quick
question
relating
to
that?
if
--
if
an
all-comers
policy
is
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
viewpoint,
does
it
violate
the
first
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
were
an
employment
case,
and
when
an
employee
is
denied
promotion
the
employee
said
it's
for
reason
a,
and
then
after
litigation
begins
the
employer
says,
well,
no,
it
really
wasn't
for
reason
a,
it
was
for
reason
b
because
of
a
policy
that
we've
long
had,
but
there's
never
--
there's
no
written
documentation
of
this
new
policy;
and
then
at
a
later
point
in
the
litigation
the
employer
says,
well,
it
wasn't
really
either
for
reason
a
or
reason
b;
it
was
for
reason
c
--
do
you
think
that
summary
judgment
could
be
granted
in
favor
of
the
employer
on
the
issue
of
pretext?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
section
66270
applies
to
programs
conducted
by
a
post-secondary
educational
institution,
and
your
position
is
that
if
--
if
a
religious
group
complies
with
your
policies
and
then
it
conducts
religious
services,
those
religious
services
are
conducted
by
hastings?
